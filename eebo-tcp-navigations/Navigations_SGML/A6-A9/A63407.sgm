<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir Robert Clayton,
LORD MAYOR ELECT
OF THE
CITY of LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Encouragement
the City-Trade and
Forein Di&s;coveries is
like to find under
Your Lord&s;hip's Ma|gi&s;tracy,
ought to be
the chief Encourage|ment
of any Publick-&s;pirited
Per&s;on to
render unto You all due Acknowledgments
and Te&s;timonies of Honour in this kind.
The City of <HI>LONDON</HI> is doubtle&s;s the
Head and Promotre&s;s of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade,
<PB REF="3">
and Your Lord&s;hip is the de&s;igned Head
and Repre&s;entative of the City: That Obli|gation
Forein Traffique hath to <HI>London, Lon|don</HI>
oweth partly to the wi&s;e Councils and
Government of its Chief Magi&s;trate, and
it &s;carce ever had any, of who&s;e Prudence
Courage, and Moderation, it ought to con|ceive
greater hopes than of Your Lord|&s;hip's.
Hard Weather needs Re&s;olute Pi|lots,
and Good Magi&s;trates are ordinarily
&s;ent by God again&s;t bad Times: And far be
it from us that we &s;hould make Times
wor&s;e than they are. But as it hath been
my bad more than my good Fortune to be
&s;ome years ago the fir&s;t <HI>Avant</HI> Courier,
who from the Enemies Camp brought the
Tidings of the&s;e Helli&s;h Attempts, that now
cau&s;e our Dome&s;tic Troubles; &s;o I in this
Book pre&s;ent to Your Lord&s;hip, and all <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
an unavoidable and impartial Argu|ment,
to &s;hew that our Fears from Je&s;uitical
Practices are much le&s;s magnified, than
they are by them beyond mea&s;ure extenua|ted,
by a new Popi&s;h Device of Creating
Security: For herein Your Lord&s;hip may
&s;ee what the Je&s;uits are, where ever they get
Footing and Credit, in the furthe&s;t part of
<HI>Japon,</HI> as well as in <HI>Venice, Paris, Ireland,</HI> and
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<Q>Coelum non Animum mutant, c&ugrave;m trans mare currunt.</Q>
<P>You &s;hall ob&s;erve (I &s;ay) how the&s;e <HI>Igna|tians</HI>
Covetou&s;ne&s;s and State-undermining,
<PB REF="3">
brought the greate&s;t Rebellion, Bloud&s;hed,
and Ma&s;&s;acre upon about 60000 Chri&s;tians
at one blow, that ever was &s;een in tho&s;e Ea|&s;tern
Parts of the World; and how thereby
&s;ome Hundred Thou&s;ands in after Per&s;ecu|tions
were de&s;troyed; may, and the whole
Chri&s;tian Name quite extirpated (in hatred
of their Practices) by Heathen Monarchs,
who could not think their Heads, Crowns,
nor E&s;tates, to be otherwi&s;e &s;afe from the Fa|ctious
Di&s;ciples of this <HI>Loyola.</HI> Yet all theirs,
and their &s;ecret Factors Devices, will (I
hope) come to nought, if we follow tho&s;e
moderate, peaceable, and judicious Coun|&s;els,
Your Lord&s;hip's Eloquent Speech hath
&s;et out unto us; begetting a &s;ober and
hearty Harmony 'twixt Prince and People.
If the Ship be kept in good order within,
there's little to be fear'd from Storms with|out.
I remark, That it depended much
on the <HI>Tribunus Plebis,</HI> or Lord Mayor of the
old <HI>Rome,</HI> (mo&s;t like to our <HI>London</HI> in Policy
and Magi&s;tracy) to keep it and the whole
Government in an even temper, and to
maintain a Lovely Corre&s;pondency be|twixt
the Senat and the People; and it was
by him that the Enemies or Friends of the
Commonwealth ordinarily wrought their
ends of Peace or Di&s;turbance. Therefore
as Your Lord&s;hip hath always appeared, as
well in your Actions as in your Words, a
Sincere and Brave-&s;pirited Patriot, a Mode|rate
and Reconciling Subject, it is not to be
<PB REF="4">
doubted but that Your Lord&s;hip will give
that Satisfaction to the Court, City, and
Country, and even to all Forein Traffiquers
them&s;elves, that is ju&s;tly expected and con|ceived
of you. So that Quiet, Peace, Trade,
and Forein Di&s;coveries, being encouraged
and promoted in your Times, your Name
&s;hall be not onely re&s;pected and honoured
among your Countreymen, but al&s;o in
tho&s;e remote&s;t parts of the World, where
this &s;mall Work (mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for all
<HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Merchants and Travellers) will
&s;ound it out, and te&s;tifie with all the due

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE World being an ample
Volum, in who&s;e Extent
and Varieties the Framer's
Wi&s;dom and Attributes are
manife&s;tly read and &s;et out,
it &s;eems that great Travel|lers
are the be&s;t Scholars
and Proficients in this Book;
&s;ince on's Native Countrey is but as a &s;ingle Leaf, where
all the Singularities are not to be &s;een which are found
in the other.</P>
<Q>&mdash;Non omnis fert omnia Tellus.</Q>
<P>And the truth of it is, tho&s;e Ancient Philo&s;ophers,
who have fir&s;t laid the Foundations of Arts, Sciences,
and Commonwealths in the World, were Travellers in|to
the&s;e very Ea&s;tern Parts, (partly de&s;cribed by us
here) whence they brought home all their Knowledge;
it being here that Man and Knowledge it &s;elf had their
fir&s;t beginning. So that wi&s;e Travellers are not un|like
<PB REF="5">
tho&s;e rich laden Ve&s;sels which through many dangers
bring whole&s;om and profitable <HI>Cargo's,</HI> Drugs, and
other Conveniences, to be di&s;pers'd among the &s;everal
Societies of their own Countrey: They are like tho&s;e di|ligent
Ma&s;ter-Bees, who run divers miles to extract
out of many bitter Herbs that &s;weet Liquor, which they
afterwards kindly refund to be enjoyed at home in com|mon,
in the harde&s;t Sea&s;ons of the Year, by their Fel|lows.
What co&s;ts them dear, others have it cheap:
And there's &s;carce any Private Per&s;ons in the Common|wealth,
to whom we owe greater Honour and Thanks&punc;
than to Worthy Travellers and Di&s;coverers of For<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="3+ letters">
Countries.</P>
<P>Yet it may be truly &s;aid, That Ancient Travellers
and Geographers have but as cour&s;e Limners and
Coa&s;t-Drivers, drawn a very rough Draught in their
Relations of tho&s;e Countries they de&s;crib'd unto us, in
compari&s;on of &s;ome later Writers, who al&s;o &s;ometimes
do but copy their Predece&s;&s;ors Stories; and Merchants,
with mo&s;t other Travellers, are weather-driven by their
private Occa&s;ions or Misfortunes, to take but a Cur|&s;ory
Survey of Places, and &s;o give but an an&s;werable
account of the &s;ame to the World.</P>
<P>But among all the Ancient and Modern Travellers,
none had &s;uch fair Opportunities and Advantages as the
Illu&s;trious Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> had, to make a true,
profitable, and exact Relation of the Singularities of
tho&s;e Remote Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where he pa&s;t &s;o many
<PB REF="5">
Years in great Splendour, as &s;hall appear by the en&s;u|ing
Con&s;iderations and Qualifications of a good Tra|veller.</P>
<P N="1">1. He from his Youth had a &s;trong Inclination to
Travel, which &s;ecret In&s;tinct is certainly a Preordina|tion
of God for an Undertaking; and this un&s;een Impul|&s;ion
carries &s;uch extraordinary In&s;truments chearfully
and pro&s;perou&s;ly through all the Difficulties, others of a
contrary di&s;po&s;ition would never wade thorough, for
whom it would be in vain to &s;trive again&s;t the current of
Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Travelling <HI>Genius</HI> made him begin early
to fit him&s;elf for his de&s;ign, and &s;oon to go about it. He
was therefore &s;ufficiently imbued in his Intellectuals with
all due knowledge of Sciences, Language, and Geogra|phy,
and precedent Travellers Maps and Books, with|out
all which common Travellers cannot conceive &s;o &s;oon
and &s;o orderly, nor reap &s;o much benefit for them&s;elves or
others.</P>
<P N="3">3. But Speculations without Experience are but un|profitable
Notions; and the Experiments of this kind
are not to be had without <HI>great Means and Ex|pence,</HI>
for want of which many a good Undertaking is
Still-born.
<Q><L>Haud facil&egrave; emergunt, quorum virtu|tibus
ob&s;tat</L>
<L>Res angu&s;ta domi&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB REF="6">
is an old and true Saying. But our noble <HI>Tavernier</HI>
had an ample E&s;tate, drove a great Trade, had Money
in abundance, and a Prince's or Emba&s;&s;ador-like Reti|nue,
without which and great Pre&s;ents none is &s;carce
look'd upon in Luxurious <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> fit for admittance in|to
great and worthy Companies, where Knowledge may
be attained; &s;o that he thereby &s;oon got into the Pre|&s;ence,
Familiarity, and Clo&s;ets of the Emperours, the
Mini&s;ters of State, and the Philo&s;ophers of <HI>Per&s;ia,
Mogol,</HI> &amp;c. and got into the Acquaintance and Con|ver&s;ations
of the leading and common Merchants, Traf|fiquers,
and People; and knew their Languages very
well: for it is in vain to have Eyes, if one have not al&s;o
a Tongue in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. And whereas Learning and Riches do &s;ometimes
render narrow Souls of a more proud and un&s;ociable
temper, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> is by Nature and Edu|cation,
an obliging, cheerful, and in&s;inuating Travel|ler,
and of a graceful Countenance. Comely Per&s;onages
are beloved almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are &s;een; and tho&s;e
that have but fair Souls, are not &s;o till after they are
known. Now Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> having both the&s;e
Advantages, had a free entrance into the Friend&s;hip
and Notions the <HI>Indians</HI> (great or &s;mall) had con|cerning
the Natural, Mechanical, Political, Religi|ous,
and Trading State of their own Countrey; which he
made more his bu&s;ine&s;s to know, than to grow more rich.
<PB REF="6">
And at &s;ome times he would reckon Thou&s;ands of Pounds
as nothing to attain his ends in this point of Knowledge
and further Experience; as the peru&s;al of this his own
Work, and Per&s;ons now in <HI>London,</HI> that knew him in
and after his Travels, can fully te&s;tifie.</P>
<P N="5">5. Moreover, Mutual Help of Per&s;ons equally un|der&s;tanding
and curious, is a great advantage in &s;uch
Re&s;earches and Ob&s;ervations as the&s;e. Now <HI>John
Bapti&s;ta Tavernier,</HI> be&s;ides many other Heads and
Hands, had herein the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Brother, as com|plete
a Traveller as him&s;elf in tho&s;e furthe&s;t Parts of
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and had no le&s;s the foregoing Qualifications in
Per&s;on and E&s;tate than this his Brother <HI>John Bap|ti&s;ta</HI>
had, as the Reader may well perceive by this Vo|lum
of Travels.</P>
<P N="6">6. And as for the <HI>Time;</HI> Six Voyages, and about
Forty Years Abode in tho&s;e Countries they do de&s;cribe,
did render the&s;e Brethrens Knowledge va&s;t, their Ex|periments
tried over and over, and this their Account
more &s;ure and exact (as I &s;aid) than that of any other
Traveller heretofore.</P>
<P N="7">7. And finally, to confirm the undoubted Credit
that's to be given to this Nobleman and his Relation,
(who is above all de&s;ign of Flattering or Deceiving the
Reader) you may meet with &s;everal Worthy Per&s;ons
in this City and the Court of <HI>England;</HI> and I my &s;elf,
who was at <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ome few years ago at Mon&s;ieur
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Arrival, and who can witne&s;s the grand
E&s;teem, the &s;olemn Honours and Thanks, that were
then given him by Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Degrees,
the <HI>French Ea&s;t India</HI> Company's Admiration and
Recommendation of him, that he had done his King
and Countrey more Credit in tho&s;e proud Ea&s;tern
Courts than ever any did before him; the <HI>French</HI>
King's imploying of him there; the Rarities he
brought home to the Learned; the va&s;t Riches and
Memoirs he gained for him&s;elf, and the incomparable
Jewels and Singularities he brought to the <HI>French</HI>
King; the Titles of <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Baron</HI> conferred upon
him extraordinarily, though he were a Merchant and
a &s;trict Prote&s;tant. The&s;e (I &s;ay) Public and Private
Te&s;timonials do &s;hew what Credit other Nations and
his own (which is Singular) had given to him. But
in a word his own Ob&s;ervations herein gathered will
prove it better.</P>
<P>But if any de&s;ire to have &s;ome Account of the Work
it &s;elf, the Newne&s;s, Profit, and Satisfaction the very
Subject mu&s;t needs yield to all Per&s;ons and Profe&s;&s;ions
cannot but be acceptable.</P>
<P>The Naturali&s;t &s;hall have Plants, Minerals, Ani|mals,
and <HI>Phoenomena's</HI> never &s;een in our Climate.
And about Phy&s;ic, the Law, Mu&s;ic, and Poetry, more
<PB REF="7">
Time and Tryals are required in tho&s;e Countries than
here; and you &s;hall accordingly read of Cures done that
draw near to natural Miracles.</P>
<P>The Divine will &s;ee things worth his Ob&s;ervation in
their Religion and Morals, wherein they may confound
the very Chri&s;tians; whereof I'le onely touch but thus
much: That by the Light of Nature tho&s;e Heathens
own a Supreme Deity, and a Future State of Happi|ne&s;s
and Torments; and do in view of the &s;ame mo&s;t
&s;trictly keep the Civil and the Ten Moral Command|ments,
much an&s;werable to ours, which their Prophets
have left to them. So that they puni&s;h Murther and
Adultery even in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tunquin ch. 7. p. 18.</NOTE> Princes and Prince&s;&s;es; terrible
Examples whereof you may here read at large. And
the Church and State Government are &s;ub&s;ervient in a
Subordination, the one being a Prop to the other.</P>
<P>Even State&s;men may find Subject of weighty con&s;ide|ration,
in the Antiquity, Model, and Exactne&s;s of their
Government. As for in&s;tance: Though they have a
&s;pecial regard to Monarchy, &s;o as to keep the Succe&s;&s;ion
within the &s;ame Line; yet the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tunquin c. 11. p. 35.</NOTE> Great Con&s;table, and
the King's Council have Power left them to propo&s;e and
chu&s;e the fitte&s;t Per&s;on among the Royal Children, or Col|lateral
Succe&s;&s;ors, who is nominated in the King's
Life-time, to prevent after Di&s;turbances. They have
<PB REF="8">
al&s;o on the other &s;ide very &s;ingular and unimitable ways
to prevent the In&s;urrections, Divi&s;ions, and Rebellions
of the <HI>Militia</HI> and the People.</P>
<P>But above all, the Traveller and Traffiquer into
tho&s;e Parts will be like to run into a thou&s;and Inconve|niences,
and Lo&s;&s;es of Health, Life, and E&s;tate, with|out
being guided by &s;uch Directions as he carefully gives
herein, which others cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;o &s;oon and &s;o well
know.</P>
<P>It is in fine herein declared, by what means the
<HI>French, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Portugal Ea&s;t India</HI>
Companies were Settled, Improved, and Wor&s;ted in
tho&s;e Countries; al&s;o the Coinage, and the Reduction
thereof to ours; the particular places where all &s;orts
of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Commodities are be&s;t and cheape&s;t had;
the Rates and Exchange Returns are here to be found;
the manner how to know their Fal&s;ifications in Gold, Sil|ver,
Jewels, Drugs, Silks, Linen, and all the other
Merchandizes which are brought from tho&s;e Nations
are here &s;et down: It being otherwi&s;e hard or impo&s;&s;ible
to e&s;cape the Cheats of the <HI>Per&s;ians, Chine&s;es,</HI> and
<HI>Japoners,</HI> without &s;uch In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>I'le &s;ay no more, but that in this Work was imployed
the Help of another Worthy Gentleman, who labour'd
<PB REF="8">
in the fir&s;t Volum of <HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Tran&s;lation; but it

Of the KINGDOM of

With a MAP of the COUNTRY and

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Di&s;cour&s;e in general concerning the City of Tun|quin,
and of the Manner how the Author came
to have knowledge thereof.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> has been long
unknown to the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> nei|ther
have they, who have given us Rela|tions
thereof, well under&s;tood the Coun|try,
as having tru&s;ted too much to
defective and fabulous De&s;criptions and
Ob&s;ervations. Not that I am willing to be
over &s;evere in cen&s;uring; but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively I am bold to af|firm,
That this which I here make Public was extracted out
of my Brother's Writings, of which I had the overlooking in
<PB N="2" REF="13">
my &s;econd Voyage that I made to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and of which
I was the more confident, for that the Author had been
one who had made Eleven or Twelve Voyages from
<HI>Batavia, Bantam,</HI> and <HI>Achem,</HI> to <HI>Tunquin:</HI> Other Ob&s;erva|tions
I collected from the <HI>Tunquine&s;i</HI> them&s;elves, with whom
I have had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es, during the time that I was at
<HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> where they principally trade. And
that which gave me the more light was this, That tho&s;e
Merchants &s;everal times bring along with them &s;ome of
their <HI>Bonze's</HI> or Prie&s;ts, as al&s;o &s;ome of their Learned Men
to teach their Children to Write and Read. For the&s;e Mer|chants
when they make a Voyage by Sea, carry all their
Families along with them. And from the&s;e <HI>Bonze's</HI> and
other Learned Men I had &s;everal Ob&s;ervations and Memoirs
in Writing, as being de&s;irous to be inform'd by me of the
Government and Situation of our <HI>France.</HI> And as I was
never without an <HI>Atlas</HI> and &s;ome other particular Maps, they
were ravi&s;h'd with admiration, when I &s;hew'd them the
Structure and Compo&s;ure of the whole World, and the
Situation of its &s;everal Kingdoms and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Therefore may the Reader with the more plea&s;ure and
delight peru&s;e the&s;e Relations, when he has &s;o much rea&s;on
to be per&s;uaded that they are cordially done, and that they
are made public by a per&s;on who&s;e &s;incerity has no de&s;ign
to abu&s;e him. My Brother, who was a per&s;on both cun|ning
and couragious, and one that lov'd to Travel as well
as my &s;elf, having heard much talk in the <HI>Indies</HI> of the
Grandeur of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> re&s;olv'd to go thither,
and as he had a particular gift to learn a Language in a little
time, he &s;oon grew familiar with the <HI>Malaye,</HI> which is the
Language of the Learned in tho&s;e quarters of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as <HI>Latin</HI>
is among Us in <HI>Europe.</HI> He under&s;tood that Silk, Musk, and
other Commodities of the like nature, were much cheaper
there then in other places adjoyning, and that the People
dealt with more fairne&s;s and hone&s;ty. Upon the encourage|ment
of which Information he prepar'd a Ship, and made
his Voyages with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He always carri'd with him a good Sum of Money; and
more then that, he &s;tor'd him&s;elf with a con&s;iderable number
of &s;mall Curio&s;ities, to pre&s;ent the King and his Nobility,
according to the general Cu&s;tom of all the Ea&s;tern Countries:
<PB N="3" REF="13">
Thus he came to be well receiv'd the fir&s;t time that he &s;et
foot in the Country; &s;o that the Cu&s;tomer being by him
oblig'd with a &s;mall Clock; a pair of &s;mall Pi&s;tols, and two
Pictures, which were the Pictures of two <HI>Curte&s;ans,</HI> imme|diately
gave notice to the King of his arrival. Thereupon
having order to attend the Court, and coming to ki&s;s the
King's hands, the whole A&s;&s;embly was &s;urpris'd to hear a
Stranger, born in a Country &s;o far di&s;tant, &s;peak the <HI>Malaye</HI>
Language &s;o fluently. The King gave him a favourable
reception, and kindly receiv'd the Pre&s;ent which he brought
along with him. It was a very noble Sword, of which the
Handle and Hilt were all over enchac'd with Rubies and
Emraulds, with a Back&s;word Blade. To this he added a
pair of Pi&s;tols, adorn'd and inlaid with Silver, a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Saddle and Bridle, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, a
Bow and Quiver full of Arrows, and &s;ix Pictures, like tho&s;e
which he had given the Cu&s;tomer. The&s;e things highly
pleas'd the King, who pre&s;ently drew forth the Sword out
of the Scabbard, the better to look upon and con&s;ider it. At
length one of his Sons took it up, to try whether it would
fit his hand as well as tho&s;e of his own Country, and offer'd
to make a blow. My Brother, &s;eeing the young Prince
handle the Weapon gracefully enough, after the manner of
the Country, told the King, that if he pleas'd, he would
&s;how the King how they handled that Weapon in <HI>France,</HI>
of which the King readily con&s;ented to be a Spectatour.</P>
<P>This was my Brother's fir&s;t Reception at Court; for he
made &s;everal Voyages to <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and every time that he
return'd, they &s;till the more and more obligingly entertain'd
him. But that which fix'd him more in the good opinion
and favour of the King and Lords of the Court, was his
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken" EXTENT="1+ letters">olic and gentile behaviour in playing with them for &s;everal
large Sums, in&s;omuch that being one that ventur'd deep;
he lo&s;t above 20000 Crowns in one Voyage. However
the King, who was a generous Prince, would not &s;uffer him
to be a lo&s;er, but gave him tho&s;e con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents that
&s;uppli'd his lo&s;&s;es. By means of my Brother's thus long
&s;ojourning in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and the familiar acquaintance which
he had at Court, together with the Trade which he drove
in the Kingdom, as he was diligent to inform him&s;elf of all
the Curio&s;ities of the Country, it was ea&s;ie for me upon
<PB N="4" REF="14">
the &s;ame foundation to lay the Structure of the&s;e Memoirs.
Though I may &s;afely &s;ay, I was no le&s;s laborious in my
own particular, and by the frequent Di&s;cour&s;es which I had
with a great number of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> with whom I met
both at <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> that came thither to Trade, and
whom I often treated at my own Expences, to inform
my &s;elf of the particular Ceremonies and Cu&s;toms of their
Country.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the Grounds and Foundations of this Rela|tion,
which is both faithful and exact, and by which that
noble Country, of which the De&s;criptions hitherto have
been &s;o ob&s;cure and uncertain, &s;hall be truly di&s;cover'd and
&s;et forth, &s;uch as it is; declaring withal, that no other Con|&s;ideration

<P>For the better ob&s;ervation of a right Method in pur&s;uance
of this Relation, and to conduct the Reader <HI>gradatim</HI> to
the more perfect knowledge of this Kingdom, I will &s;peak
fir&s;t of its Situation, its Extent, and its Climate. Next I
&s;hall come to di&s;cour&s;e of its Qualities, its Riches, and its
Trade, which are the three Springs and Sources of the
Strength and Force of a Nation. Next I &s;hall give an Ac|count
of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the People as well in
their particular OEconomy and Civil Society, as in relation
to their Marriages, their Vi&s;its and Fe&s;tivals. Next to this
we &s;hall give a brief Account of the Learning, and learned
Men, and among them of their Phy&s;icians, and the Subject
of their Art, that is to &s;ay, of the Di&s;ea&s;es particular to the
Country. We &s;hall al&s;o give a Relation of the Original of
the Government and Policy of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> of
the Condition of the Court, of the Inauguration and Fune|rals
of their Kings, and in the la&s;t place of the Original of
the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And I dare ingage, that the Map of the Country, and the
Cuts which were drawn upon the place, will no le&s;s contri|bute

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Situation and Extent of the Kingdom
of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall have the le&s;s rea&s;on to admire where|fore
our Predece&s;&s;ors had &s;o little knowledge
of this Kingdom, when we con&s;ider that
having formerly been a con&s;iderable part of <HI>China,</HI> the In|habitants
in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> did, kept them|&s;elves
clo&s;e within their own bounds, never minding to
have any Commerce with other People, whom they con|temn'd
and lookt upon as <HI>Barbarians</HI> come from the other
part of the World. But now that they find that Strangers
come to find them out in their own Territories, they begin
to &s;ee that other People have as good Government as them|&s;elves;
which has bred in them a de&s;ire to Conver&s;e and
Trade with Foreigners; &s;o that now they a&s;&s;ociate them|&s;elves
in friendly manner with all other People, as I have
ob&s;erv'd them to do both at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam.</HI> Mo&s;t
people believe this Country to lye in a very hot Climate;
neverthele&s;s it is now known to be very temperate, by
rea&s;on of the great number of Rivers that water it; which,
together with the Rains that fall in their Sea&s;ons, cau&s;e a
brisk fre&s;hne&s;s of the Air; which indeed happ'ns mo&s;t
u&s;ually over all the <HI>Torrid-zone,</HI> as I have ob&s;erv'd in my
<HI>Indian Travels.</HI> From whence we may al&s;o have rea&s;on
to believe the Country to be very fruitful and thick inha|bited.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t this Kingdom lies upon the Province of <HI>Cau|ton,</HI>
one of the be&s;t of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>To the We&s;t it is bounded by the Kingdom of <HI>Brama.</HI></P>
<P>To the North it borders upon two other Provinces of
<HI>China, Junnan</HI> and <HI>Quan&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>To the South it lies upon <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and the great Gulph
of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>To return to the Climate, the Air is &s;o mild and tem|perate,
that all the year long &s;eems to be but one continual
Spring; Fro&s;t and Snow are never there to be &s;een; and
<PB N="6" REF="15">
be&s;ides, the Pe&s;tilence, the Gout, the Stone, and other
Di&s;ea&s;es &s;o frequent in <HI>Europe,</HI> there are never known. There
are but two Winds, which divide the whole Year between
them; the one blowing from the North, the other from
the South, and both continuing the &s;ame for &s;ix months
together. The fir&s;t refre&s;hes the Earth in that manner, that
there is nothing &s;o delightful as the Country of <HI>Tunquin.</HI>
The other begins to blow from the end of <HI>January</HI> to the
end of <HI>July;</HI> and the two la&s;t months are their months
of rain. The greate&s;t inconvenience is, that there
ari&s;e once in &s;eaven years, as well in this Country as
in other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> tho&s;e hideous and terrible
Tempe&s;ts, that blow down Hou&s;es, tear up Trees
by the roots, and make &s;trange De&s;olations. They &s;eldom
la&s;t above four and twenty hours, nor are their &s;ad Effects
to be felt but only upon the Seas of <HI>China, Japon, Cochin|china,
Tunquin,</HI> and the <HI>Manilles,</HI> being rarely known in any
other Seas.</P>
<P>The A&s;trologers of tho&s;e parts believe that the&s;e terrible
Tempe&s;ts proceed from the Exhalations that ri&s;e out of the
Mines of <HI>Japon.</HI> It comes with that &s;uddain force that when
it &s;urprizes a Ve&s;&s;el out at Sea, the Pilots have no other
remedy then to cut down all the Ma&s;ts, that the &s;torm
may have the le&s;s force upon the Ship.</P>
<P>In this fair extent of Land, almo&s;t equal to that of <HI>France,</HI>
are &s;everal Provinces, who&s;e limmits are not well known;
the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> being no great Geographers, nor having bin
over curious to write the Annals of the Nation. But the
mo&s;t under&s;tanding and knowing among them a&s;&s;ur'd me at
<HI>Batavia,</HI> that the whole Kingdom contain'd above twenty
thou&s;and Cities and Towns. They al&s;o affirm'd that there
might be many more, but after the manner of their Neigh|bours
the <HI>Cochinchine&s;es,</HI> many of the People choo&s;e rather to
upon the Water then upon the Land; &s;o that you &s;hall &s;ee
live the greate&s;t part of their Rivers covered with Boates,
which &s;erve them in&s;tead of Hou&s;es; and which are very
neat, though they al&s;o keep their Cattel in them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Quality of the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THis Country for the mo&s;t part is a level Extent,
which ri&s;es up and down into plea&s;ant Hillocks;
the greate&s;t Hills which it has lying to the North.
It is water'd by &s;everal Rivers which inter-cut and glide
through the Country: &s;ome of which carry Galleys of
good burthen, and large Shallps, very commodious for
trade. Yet in all the Country there grows neither Corn
nor Wine, by rea&s;on of the want of rain, which never falls
but in the Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> But it bears an infinite
quantity of Rice, which is the chief &s;u&s;tenance of the
People. Of this Rice al&s;o they make their Drink, be&s;ides
which they have good <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> or Strong-water. Their
Fruits are excellent, but much different from ours, as are al&s;o
the Trees that bear them. The chiefe&s;t of the&s;e Trees are
the Palm-tree, which bears a Fruit bigger then in any part
of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The Nut is about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Head,
in &s;hape like a <HI>Coco</HI>-nut; the Shell is very hard, and being
open'd, the Pulp within is as white as Snow, having a ta&s;t
like our Almonds, and every one of the Fruits contains
about two gla&s;sfuls of Liquor, very refre&s;hing and plea&s;ing
to the Palate. The <HI>Gogavier,</HI> very much re&s;embles our
Lawrel, of which there are two &s;orts; the one bears a
Plum, green without and red within: but the Fruit of the
other Tree, which is in much more e&s;teem, is yellowi&s;h
without and white within, the top of the Fruit being like a
&s;mall No&s;egay: the Pulp is full of &s;mall Kernels, le&s;s then
tho&s;e of a Pomegranate; and if they be eaten before they
are ripe they bind the belly, whereas being eaten when
they are come to full maturity they work a contrary effect.
Formerly this Fruit was not known in the Kingdom of <HI>Tun|quin,</HI>
but after the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;eated them&s;elves at <HI>Macao,</HI> they
carri'd &s;everal Plants thither, &s;o that now the Fruit is grown
very common. The <HI>Papager</HI> bears a Fruit which very much
re&s;embles a &s;mall Melon, the ta&s;t whereof is very delicious.
The <HI>Arager</HI> grows upright and &s;treight, like the Ma&s;t of a
<PB N="8" REF="16">
Ship, bearing no Branches but at the top; which makes it
appear like a Crown. The Fruit which it produces is like a
Nutmeg, but a little more round. The People break this
Nut, and brui&s;ing it together with <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> leaves, mix both with
a little Chalk, and make u&s;e of the Powder to keep their
Teeth clean, to dye their Lips of a Vermilion colour, and to
keep their Breath &s;weet.</P>
<P>They have but two &s;orts of Figs, the one like ours, and
the other like tho&s;e which are call'd <HI>Adam</HI>'s Figs, as long as a
Man's finger.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Tree, very like our <HI>Willow,</HI> which
they call the <HI>Powder Tree,</HI> becau&s;e that of the Wood they
make Charcoal, and of the Coal a Powder which they make
u&s;e of in their Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jambager</HI> is another Tree, that grows very high,
which bears a Fruit about the bigne&s;s of a Citrul-Cucum|ber,
the Pulp whereof is full of Kernels like a Granate, very
cooling and plea&s;ant, and very frequently eaten in the Sea&s;on
of heat.</P>
<P>The High-ways are al&s;o planted with Trees on both &s;ides
for the convenience of Travellers: And there are &s;ome of
the&s;e Trees &s;o big that two or three thou&s;and men may &s;tand
under them, like that at <HI>Ormus,</HI> or <HI>Bandar Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> by me
de&s;crib'd in my Relations of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and of which many
other Travellers have made mention. When the Branches
of the&s;e Trees are about ten or twelve foot long, there i&s;&s;ue
forth other little Branches which turn downward, and by
little and little de&s;cending to the ground, take root and
afterwards become as it were &s;o many Pillars to &s;upport the
<HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>-Branches. There are &s;ome of the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>-Branches
three hundred Paces long, which are &s;upported by the&s;e out|growing
Branches at the di&s;tance of every ten or twelve
foot. The Fruit is of the bigne&s;s of one of our great Nuts,
the Shell whereof is red, containing within nothing but a
Kernel like a grain of Millet. The Rere Mice feed upon 'em,
and al&s;o make their Ne&s;ts in the trees. The&s;e Rere-mice
are as big as a good Pullet, in&s;omuch that their Wings are
above a foot and a half long. They never light upon the
tree like other Birds, but you &s;hall &s;ee them all the day long
hanging at the branches of the trees, fa&s;ten'd by their Claws
to the tree with their heads downward. Upon every Wing
<PB N="9" REF="16">
they have &s;even as it were little Hooks or Claws, &s;o that
being &s;hot, they never fall to the ground, but remain fixed
to the branches, that at a di&s;tance you would take them to be
&s;ome great Pears that hung upon the tree. They are ac|counted
a great dainty among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who leave their
Pullets to eat them. 'Tis true that their Fle&s;h is very white,
and when they are young they are a delicate &s;ort of Diet.
I happen'd to eat of them two or three times with the <HI>Por|tugals,</HI>
who thought they had oblig'd me with a great dainty;
and had I not known what they were, I &s;hould have taken
them for Pullets. And now I am talking of the Delicacies
of the Country, I will tell you of one &s;ort of Dyet which
is very &s;ingular. This Food is the Ne&s;t of a certain Bird
which is no where to be found, but in the four I&s;lands that
lie upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and of which you have
the Figures in the Table <HI>A, B, C, D.</HI> The&s;e Birds are about
the bigne&s;s of a Swallow, and build their Ne&s;ts in &s;uch a
manner, that they are neither too clo&s;e compacted, nor alto|gether
tran&s;parent; they are like an Onion compos'd of
&s;everal rings and envelopings; that compo&s;e a Ne&s;t of a cer|tain
&s;ort of <HI>Gunim,</HI> which is &s;teep'd in warm water, and mix'd
with all the Sawces which are made both for Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h.
It is tran&s;ported all over <HI>India</HI> and into <HI>Holland</HI> for Curio&s;itie's
&s;ake. You would believe in eating tho&s;e Meats which are
&s;ea&s;on'd therewith, that tho&s;e Ne&s;ts were compos'd of all
the Spices in the Orient. I have not only brought this Diet
into <HI>France,</HI> and pre&s;ented of it to &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality,
but I have al&s;o my Vouchers for the truth of what I relate,
&s;everal of my Friends who have brought it from <HI>Holland,</HI>
among the re&s;t <HI>M. de Villermont,</HI> who&s;e Name is famous for
his Travels into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> He and all tho&s;e that have
eat thereof agree with me, that all the Spices of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
put together, do not give that effectual reli&s;h and &s;avour
as the&s;e Ne&s;ts do, to the Meats and Di&s;hes wherein they
are us'd.</P>
<P>Near to the&s;e four I&s;lands, where the&s;e Birds Ne&s;ts are
found, are five others mark'd in the Map 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
In the&s;e five I&s;lands are &s;uch infinite number of <HI>Tortoi&s;es,</HI> and
&s;uch excellent Food, that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> do
not believe they have entertain'd their Friends at a Banquet
as they ought to do, till the <HI>Tortoi&s;es</HI> are brought in. Tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="17">
two Nations pickle up great quantities of them, and &s;end
them abroad, which is a va&s;t trade among them; and indeed
the chiefe&s;t occa&s;ion of the Wars between them is, becau&s;e
the <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> do all they can to hinder the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> to
fi&s;h for them, alledging that tho&s;e Seas and I&s;lands belong
to them. Neither is the Meat but the Shell al&s;o of great
e&s;teem, and one of the greate&s;t Commodities for Trade in
<HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tunquin</HI> al&s;o affords great &s;tore of <HI>Anana's</HI> and Orange
trees, of which there are of two &s;orts: the one that bears
a Fruit no bigger then an <HI>Abricot;</HI> the other bigger then
tho&s;e of <HI>Portugal:</HI> both alike in ta&s;t, and being to be gather'd
from the tree for &s;ix months together. They have al&s;o two
&s;orts of Citrons, the one yellow, the other green; but both
the one and the other &s;o tart and &s;ow'r, that they cannot be
eaten without offence to the Stomach. Neverthele&s;s, the
Juyce is made u&s;e of as we do here of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> to clean&s;e
Copper, Tin, and Iron, before we gild tho&s;e Metals, as
al&s;o for Tinctures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Silk. They are al&s;o
made u&s;e of for Lyes to whiten Linnen, and to take out
Spots. Through all the Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> they
make u&s;e of this Juyce of Citrons to whiten their Calicuts;
whereby they make them &s;ometimes &s;o white that they dazle
the &s;ight.</P>
<P>They make great quantities of Silk in the Kingdom of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which both rich and poor make them&s;elves
Garments. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who thru&s;t them&s;elves in every
where, where there is any hope of gain, carry off &s;uch a
quantity every year, that it is now become the chiefe&s;t part
of that Commodity which they carry to <HI>Japon;</HI> whereas
before they fetch'd their Commodities from <HI>Per&s;ia, Bengala,</HI>
or <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for &s;weet &s;melling Flow'rs, the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have but
one &s;ort, which they call the Flow'r of <HI>Bague.</HI> It grows
like a large No&s;egay, and the Branches of the Shrub that
bear it, &s;pread them&s;elves crawlingly upon the ground. As
they have great &s;tore of Sugar, &s;o they eat very much, while
it is yet in the Cane, not having the true Art to refine it: and
that which they do gro&s;ly refine, they make into little Loaves
weighing about half a pound. They eat very much, making
u&s;e of it always after Meals to help dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17">
Through the whole Kingdom are neither Lions, A&s;&s;es,
nor Sheep; but the Fore&s;ts are full of Tigers, Harts, and
Apes, and the Fields are full of Beeves, Cows, and Hogs.
As for Hens, Ducks, and Turtles, they are not to be num|ber'd,
which is the general Provi&s;ion for their Fe&s;tivals.
Their Hor&s;es are very well &s;hap'd; of which there are
always five or &s;ix hunder'd in the King's Stables; He al&s;o
keeps the &s;ame number of Elephants, of which &s;ome are
for the Service of his Hou&s;e, the re&s;t bred for the Wars.
The&s;e Elephants are of a prodigious bigne&s;s, neither are
there any &s;o tall nor &s;o nimble in any part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> for they
will bow them&s;elves, and &s;toop &s;o low, that you may get
upon their backs without help. They have no Cats, but
they have Dogs that &s;erve for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and will
watch all night to kill the Rats and Mice, which are very
large and very trouble&s;om. Very few Birds are to be &s;een
in the Air, which toward the evening grows duski&s;h, by
rea&s;on of tho&s;e va&s;t number of Gnats that get into the
Hou&s;es in the night time and hinder people from &s;leeping,
not only by the noi&s;e which they make, but with their con|tinual
&s;tinging; which is one of the greate&s;t inconveniencies
of the Country. For remedy whereof in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
an hour before they go to &s;leep they take the Husk or Chaff
of the Rice, which flies from the Rice when it is beaten, and
&s;trew it upon a &s;mall Fire in a Fire-&s;hovel, and &s;o let it &s;moak,
and by that means they kill or drive tho&s;e Flies away. Be|&s;ides
this, they cover the Bed with a Pavilion or Tent that
trails upon the ground, made like a Net with very &s;mall
holes to let in the Air. But notwith&s;tanding all the pre|vention
can be us'd, they will be about a man when he ri&s;es
i' the morning. But there is yet a far greater inconvenience
in this Country, which proceeds from the infinite numbers of
white Emmets, which though they are but little, have teeth
&s;o &s;harp, that they will eat down a wooden Po&s;t in a &s;hort
time. And if great care be not taken in the place where
you lock up your Bales of Silk, in four and twenty hours
they will eat through a Bale, as if it had been &s;aw'd in two in
the middle. Several of them have fallen from the Ciel|ing
into my Neck, where they rais'd Bli&s;ters upon the
Skin, which pre&s;ently fall again being wa&s;h'd with cold
Water.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">
I have told you that Hens and Ducks are infinitely nume|rous
in <HI>Tunquin;</HI> I will now tell you how they pre&s;erve the
Eggs of the&s;e Creatures, which they will keep for two or three
years together without being &s;poil'd. They &s;alt them, and
to make them take &s;alt, they fill a Ve&s;&s;el full of Water, and
throw a good quantity of Salt into it. If the Egg &s;ink to
the bottom, the Pickle is not good; then they throw in
more Salt, till they find that the Eggs &s;wim. The Pickle
being thus made, they take A&s;hes, and make them up into
a Pa&s;t with this Pickle: and in this Pa&s;t they enclo&s;e every
Egg by it &s;elf, and then wrap it up in a leaf of an Herb,
not unlike one of our Pear-tree leaves, but much larger, and
then put the Eggs into Earthen Pots clo&s;e cover'd: after
which manner they keep their Eggs for two or three years
together.</P>
<P>In other parts of the <HI>Indies</HI> where there is great &s;tore of
Oyl, as in the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> the Kingdoms
of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and <HI>Arochan,</HI> they put their Eggs into great Earthen
Pots well varni&s;h'd, and then fill the Ve&s;&s;el with an Oyl
which is made of a &s;mall Seed like Rape-&s;eed. For as for
Sallad Oyl, after you are once pa&s;s'd <HI>Aleppo,</HI> you &s;ee no more
Olive-trees over all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> but only in one place of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> near
<HI>Casbin,</HI> where between the Mountains lies a little Valley,
about a League long and half a League broad, full of Olive-trees,
but they make but very little Oyl, pre&s;erving the
Olives only to eat. But to return to the Eggs; they are the
chief Provi&s;ion which they eat a Ship-board. But the Eggs
which are pre&s;erv'd in Salt are preferr'd much before tho&s;e
that are kept in Oyl; becau&s;e that in u&s;ing the fir&s;t, there is
no need of carrying Salt to Sea, or of boiling Salt with their
Rice. When they eat them, they boil them till they are
hard, and with every mouthful of Rice they eat a Pea's
bigne&s;s of Egg, which is as good and better then Salt with
their Rice. As to what remains, there are neither Mines of
Gold nor Silver in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they
Coin any Money.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Riches, Trade, and Money of the
Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief Riches of the Country of <HI>Tunquin</HI> con&s;i&s;t in
the great quantity of Silks which they &s;ell to the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> and other Foreigners, and in their <HI>Lig|num
Aloes.</HI> Of which there is &s;ome worth a thou&s;and Crowns
the Pound, according to its goodne&s;s and oyline&s;s. There
is &s;ome that is not worth above three Crowns, but it is dry
and good for nothing but to make Cabinets, or Beads to
hang about Womens Necks. All the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> e&s;pecially
&s;uch as let their Beards grow, make great account of this
Wood; and when they give a Vi&s;it, they pre&s;ently bring a
little Chafing-di&s;h, and ca&s;t a &s;mall piece of this Wood
upon the Coals, which yields a &s;moak and plea&s;ing mi&s;t;
with which they perfume their Beards, at the &s;ame time
lifting up their hands to Heaven, and crying, <HI>Elhemed Illah,</HI>
or <HI>God be thanked.</HI> If the Wood be oily, the bigne&s;s of a Pea
will &s;erve to throw upon the fire, which being a little
moi&s;ten'd in Water, will yield as much &s;moak as a dry piece
as big as a Man's fi&s;t. Which is the rea&s;on, that if it be
oily and good it wants no price. One of the chief Pre&s;ents,
as I have ob&s;erv'd in another part of this Book, which
the <HI>Portugals</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> &s;ent to the Emperor of <HI>Japon,</HI> was a
piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> &s;ix foot long, and two round. It
co&s;t 40000 <HI>Pardo's</HI> or 54000 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;o much the more plea&s;ure and profit to trade with
the People of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> by how much the more faithful and
frank they are in their dealing then the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who will
deceive you if they can; &s;o that it is a hard thing to be too
cunning for them, as I have often found by experience.
When you have &s;old them any Commodity, and they find
that their Bargain is not very advantageous, their general
way of getting off is this: As they have generally three
&s;orts of Reals, one &s;ort that is full weight, others which are
light, four, others eight <HI>per Cent</HI> if they have no mind to
&s;tand to their bargain, they offer to pay you for your Goods
<PB N="14" REF="19">
in light Reals, which they have clipt them&s;elves, and &s;o
you are deceiv'd. There are no &s;uch People for Trade in
the World: they refu&s;e to deal in nothing, even in old
Shoes, and if you will &s;ell them but one of them too, they'l
buy it, without ever enquiring why you will not &s;ell the
other. But for tho&s;e of <HI>Tunquin</HI> they are more blunt and
plain in their dealing, &s;o that it is a plea&s;ure to have to deal
with them. I have told you, there are neither Mines of
Gold or Silver in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they Coin Money
there. So that in Trade they make u&s;e of certain Lingots
of Gold, as they are brought out of <HI>China,</HI> &s;ome of which
amount to 300 Livers of our Money, others to &s;ix hun|der'd.
They al&s;o make u&s;e of Bars of Silver as they are
brought from <HI>Japon.</HI> As for &s;mall Payments they either
cut the large Bars into &s;mall pieces, to which purpo&s;e they
have their Scales, like our <HI>Stelleers;</HI> or el&s;e they pay in
Foreign Coin, which are the Reals of <HI>Spain</HI> generally. This
Gold and Silver is brought from <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> in lieu
of tho&s;e va&s;t quantities of Silk which are exported out of the
Country, which with Musk and <HI>Lignum Aloes</HI> are the chief
Riches of the Kingdom.</P>

<P>THey who have written before me concerning the

Forces both by Sea and Land, and allow it a pro|digious

that the Forces which were u&s;ually wont to meet at the Ren|devouz
were 12000 Hor&s;e, 2000 Elephants, as well to carry
the King's and the Nobilities Tents and Baggage, as for the
Service of the War, 300000 Foot, and 300 Galleys. And
in regard the Kingdom is well &s;tor'd with Provi&s;ion and

that the Clocks which are made in <HI>Europe</HI> become u&s;ele&s;s in

they do as we divide the Day and Night into 24 Hours, ma|king
the Day of 12, and the Night to be of as much; &s;o to proportion
equally the Times of Working and of Re&s;t. But they do &s;ubdivide
both the Day and the Night into 4 equal parts, and this Divi&s;ion is
made known by the Strokes given upon tho&s;e Platters. As for Ex|ample:
The fir&s;t Hour of the fir&s;t Watch of the Night is mark'd by
one Blow, the &s;econd by another, and the third likewi&s;e by another.
In the &s;econd Watch of the Night the fir&s;t Hour is made known by
two Blows one after another, and &s;o of the re&s;t untill the third Watch;
then at the fir&s;t Hour of that they give three Strokes. And this Or|der
is ob&s;erved till the la&s;t Hour of the fourth Watch, which is mark'd
by four Knocks. In this manner they continue to marck the fir&s;t

&s;aw in the year 1649, when the King was preparing to
make War again&s;t the King of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> for certain Ships
which the <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> had taken from the <HI>Tunquine&s;es:</HI>
though the Quarrel was taken up by certain Emba&s;&s;adors
which the King of <HI>Cochinchina</HI> &s;ent to the King of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> to
whom the former made &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Army that was then prepar'd to march upon this
Expedition was compos'd of 8000 Hor&s;e, 94 thou&s;and Foot,
and 722 Elephants; 130 for the War, and the re&s;t to carry the
Tents and Baggage of the King and the Nobility; and 318
Galleys and Barks, very long and narrow, with Oars and
Sails; and this was that which my Brother &s;aw. The Con|dition
of the Souldiery is very toil&s;om and laborious, and
of little advantage in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> For they
are all their life time &s;o ti'd and engag'd to the Service of
the Wars, that though they are capable of other Labours
for the &s;upport of their Families, they are not permitted to
undertake it. Tho&s;e days that they are not upon the Guard,
they are oblig'd to attend their Captains where-ever they
go, and two days in a week they are compell'd to Exerci&s;e
with their Bows and Arrows in their pre&s;ence. Their Com|panies
con&s;i&s;t of a hundred or a hundred and thirty Men;
and they of each Company that have made the be&s;t &s;hot,
have one of them two Months Wages, the other one, which
is paid them in Rice. He that makes the wor&s;t &s;hot, next
time he mounts the Guard, is oblig'd to &s;tand Centinel
double his time. All the Captains look upon it as a great
piece of glory to have their Souldiers Arms and Weapons
neat and bright. If they find any ru&s;t upon them, they
&s;conce them eight days Wages for the fir&s;t fault, and for the
&s;econd they are very &s;everely cha&s;tis'd. As for tho&s;e that
&s;erve in the Galleys, they are entertain'd and li&s;ted propor|tionably.
And &s;ometimes the Captains &s;end their Souldiers
aboard for &s;ome days, that they may learn to row. For it
is one of the chiefe&s;t Pa&s;times of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin</HI> to &s;ee
the Mock-fights of the Galleys. When he has a mind to
delight him&s;elf with this Diverti&s;ment, the King, with &s;ome
part of his Court, removes to one of his fair Palaces, that
&s;tands upon one of the large&s;t Rivers in his Country; and
it is a great Honour for any of the Captains who&s;e Souldiers
carry the Victory. Now as the Victory is only got by the
<PB N="16" REF="25">
force of the Oars, it happens &s;ometimes that there are &s;ome
Souldiers who &s;train them&s;elves &s;o hard, that they fall down
dead with the Oar in their hands: for the King is the only
Judge of the Combat. Wherein the plea&s;ure that he takes
is &s;uch, that he &s;ends an Elephant to the Captain that obtains
the Victory, and gives him three Months Wages be&s;ides.
If any Souldier chance to die in this Exerci&s;e, his Widow
or his Heirs have two years Pay. But notwith&s;tanding all
their pain and labour, their Wages are &s;o &s;mall, that they
are not able to maintain their Wives and Children. But in
regard they Marry very young in this Country, the Wives
as well of the Souldiers as of all the meaner &s;ort of people,
take care to learn &s;ome Trade be&s;ides, that they may be
able to maintain their Families. The Captains al&s;o have
their work prepar'd for them. For they are oblig'd to look
after the King's Elephants, and to manage them for the
Wars, and &s;o to breed them, that they may not be afraid of
Wild-fire, or any other Artificial Fires: as al&s;o to build
places all along the Rivers, for the Galleys to ride &s;helter'd
in, when they can no longer live out at Sea. All the&s;e Offi|cers
and Captains, and Lords of the Court, which are gene|rally
call'd <HI>Mandarins,</HI> have but four days in a Month to
divert them&s;elves, two at the fir&s;t change of the Moon, and
two at the full.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Manners and Customs of the People of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THe People of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are naturally mild and peace|ful,
&s;ubmitting ea&s;ily to rea&s;on, and condemning
the Tran&s;ports of Choler. They e&s;teem the Ma|nufactures
of &s;trange Countries far beyond tho&s;e of their
own; though they are not very curious of &s;eeing any other
Countries but tho&s;e where they were born; and where, as
they &s;ay, they always de&s;ire to live, to honour the Memory
of their Ance&s;tors. They have a tone in &s;peaking, natu|rally
<PB N="17" REF="25">
&s;oft and plea&s;ing; happy memories, and in their Lan|guage,
which is very florid, they u&s;e &s;everal appo&s;ite Com|pari&s;ons.
They have good Poets among them, and People
that love Learning; in which re&s;pect they are no way infe|riour
to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> as well Men as Women, are for the mo&s;t
part well proportion'd, of an Olive Complexion, very
much admiring the whitene&s;s of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Their No&s;es
and Faces are not &s;o flat as tho&s;e of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> as being
generally better made. Their Hair is very black, which
they u&s;ually wear as long as it will grow, being very care|ful
in combing it. The Common People plait it in tre&s;&s;es;
and tie it like a great Roll upon the top of their Heads.
But the Nobility, Men of Law, and Souldiers, tie their
Locks about their Necks, that they may not flutter in their
Faces. They do not believe their Teeth to be hand&s;om, till
they have made them as black as jet; and they &s;uffer their
Nails to grow; the longe&s;t being accounted the faire&s;t.</P>
<P>Their Habit is grave and mode&s;t, being a long Robe that
reaches down to their heels, much like that of the <HI>Japonne&s;es,</HI>
without any di&s;tinction of Sex. This Habit is bound about
at the wa&s;t with a Girdle of Silk, interwoven with Gold
and Silver, the Workman&s;hip whereof is alike on both
&s;ides. As for the Souldiers, their upper Garments reach no
farther then their Knees; only their Breeches reach down to
the mid Leg, without either Ho&s;e or Shoes.</P>
<P>The vulger &s;ort of People are altogether &s;laves for one
part of the year. For unle&s;s they be the Citizens of the
Capital City, where the King keeps his Court, all the other
Handicrafts of what Trade &s;oever, as Joyners, Carpenters,
Lock&s;miths, Ma&s;ons, and the like, are oblig'd every year to
work three Months at the King's Palace; and two Months;
or Moons more (For the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> reckon their Months by
the Moon) for the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or great Lords. The re&s;t of
the year is for them&s;elves, all which time they have liberty
to work for the &s;upport of their own Family. This Service
in their Language is call<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Viecquan,</HI> or the <HI>Condition of a
Slave.</HI> But they are liable to other drudgeries wor&s;e then
tho&s;e before mention'd; as to lop Trees, with which they
chiefly feed their Elephants. This is a &s;evere days work, to
which they were condemn'd by the great Grandfather of
<PB N="18" REF="26">
the King that now reigns, after he had put an end to the
Civil Wars that turmoil'd his Kingdom, and that he had
brought his rebellious Subjects to &s;ubmit them&s;elves. They
had occa&s;ion'd him a great deal of trouble, and in regard
he could not &s;ubdue them without a great hazard of his
Army, his Council advis'd him to fami&s;h them; but he ra|ther
cho&s;e to give them their Lives, and to condemn them
and their Po&s;terity to this laborious Service, of which he
might in time reap the benefit.</P>
<P>I have told you el&s;ewhere that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> take great
delight to live upon the Rivers, which are there free from
Crocodiles and all other dangerous Animals, which haunt
the Waters of <HI>Nile</HI> and <HI>Ganges.</HI> Where we are to ob&s;erve,
that the&s;e Rivers overflow their Banks every year, after the
Rains are fall'n, with that terrible violence, that many times
they carry away whole Towns and Villages, at what time
a good part of the Kingdom looks like a Sea, re&s;embling
the lower <HI>Egypt</HI> under Water upon the Inundation of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Marriages of the Tunquine&s;es, and their
&s;everity toward Adultere&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> cannot Marry without the con&s;ent
of the Father and Mother, or if they be dead, with|out
the allowance of their neare&s;t Kindred. They
mu&s;t al&s;o have the permi&s;&s;ion of the Judge or Governour of
the place where the Marriage is to be made, for the obtain|ing
of which they mu&s;t give him &s;ome Pre&s;ent. But in regard
they were wont to exact upon the poor people more then
they were able to give them, &s;o that many Marriages were
di&s;appointed, to the great damage of the Public; the King,
who reign'd in the year 1639, being inform'd of the&s;e Extor|tions,
and their ill Con&s;equences, &s;et forth a Law to regu|late
tho&s;e Abu&s;es, and to curb the Authority of the Gover|nours.
He order'd that the young Man who was de&s;irous
to Marry, &s;hould pay no more then &s;uch a Sum, according
<PB N="19" REF="26">
to the proportion of his E&s;tate, amounting to one or two
fourths <HI>per Cent.</HI> and that they were not worth above a
hundred Crowns &s;hould pay nothing. Now in regard the
Common People, both Men and Women, are naturally
laborious, all that the Maids can get they pre&s;erve for their
Portions, and to buy them two or three hand&s;om Garments,
with a Neck-lace of Coral or yellow Amber, and a certain
number of Beads, to garni&s;h their Locks; which they &s;uffer
to hang down upon their Backs, accounting the beauty of
their Hair to con&s;i&s;t in the length.</P>
<P>There is no Wedding kept without a great Fea&s;t; and
they mu&s;t be very poor when the Fea&s;t la&s;ts not above three
days; for &s;ometimes they junket for nine days together.
The next day after the Wedding the Bridgroom calls the
Bride his Si&s;ter, and &s;he calls the Bridegroom Brother. The
Law of the Land permits the Man to divorce his wife when
he plea&s;es, which they do many times for very &s;light cau&s;es.
But the Woman has not the &s;ame Priviledge: or at lea&s;t, if
&s;he de&s;ire a &s;eparation, it is much more difficult to obtain;
and the occa&s;ion mu&s;t be very notorious. The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI>
&s;ay that this Law was made to keep the Women in &s;ub|jection,
and to oblige them to be re&s;pectful to their Husbands.
When the Husband de&s;ires this &s;eparation, the Ceremony is
this. You mu&s;t know that many of the Ea&s;tern People
never touch their Victuals with their hands, but make u&s;e
of two little &s;ticks about &s;ix inches long, gilt and varni&s;h'd,
which &s;erve them in&s;tead of Forks. The Husband then,
when he goes about to repudiate his Wife, takes one of his
own &s;ticks, and one of his Wife's, and having broken them,
they take each one half, and &s;ow it up in a piece of Silk, in
which they keep it. Then the Man is bound to re&s;tore the
Woman what &s;he brought with her, and to keep the Chil|dren
which they had between them. But the&s;e Divorces
are not half &s;o frequent as formerly.</P>
<P>The Laws are al&s;o very rigorous again&s;t Adultere&s;&s;es. So
that if a woman accus'd of this crime be convicted thereof,
&s;he is ca&s;t to an Elephant bred up to this purpo&s;e, who pre|&s;ently
throws her up into the Air with his Trunk, and when
&s;he comes to the ground, tramples her under his feet, till he
can perceive no life in her.</P>
<P>While my Brother was at the Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> he was a
<PB N="20" REF="27">
witne&s;s of the &s;evere Puni&s;hment, to which a Prince&s;s was
condemn'd, for being taken in the Act with a certain Prince.
It is the Cu&s;tom in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> when a Prince dies, to &s;hut up
in the mo&s;t private and retir'd part of all his Palace all the
women which he made u&s;e of in his life time. There they
are allow'd two Maids to attend them, they eat alone, and
&s;ee no per&s;on living any more to the very day of their deaths.
I cannot tell by what means one of the Princes of the blood
had got a view of one of the decea&s;ed King his Uncle's
wives; but being de&s;irous to &s;ee her again, and to overcome
all difficulties that oppos'd him, and to deceive the Guards
that watch'd the Dores, he made u&s;e of a &s;light not ea&s;ily di&s;|cover'd.
For you mu&s;t know, that in the Kingdom <HI>Tunquin,</HI>
as in all the Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in the Hou&s;es of the Kings
and other great Lords, the Kitchin is u&s;ually &s;eparated from
the Hou&s;e, and that the Garden is between them; &s;o that for
the better carrying the Meat from one place to another, the
Servants make u&s;e of a kind of Flasket, or rather Iron
Che&s;t. And to keep the Meat warm, the Di&s;hes are &s;up|ported
by little &s;ticks laid athwart, about an inch di&s;tant
one from another, under which is an Iron Plate with holes
pierc'd quite through, about half a foot above another,
which makes the bottom of the Che&s;t; between which
Plates they put lighted Coals, to keep the Meat warm.
The&s;e Che&s;ts being to be carri'd by two men, the <HI>Tunquine&s;e</HI>
Prince plaid his game &s;o well, that he was put into one of
the&s;e Che&s;ts wherein the Prince&s;&s;es Meat was wont to be
carri'd up into her Apartment. But he was not there many
days before the thing was di&s;cover'd. He was pre&s;ently
brought before the King, who caus'd him to have &s;everal
weighty Chains to be put about his Neck and Wa&s;t, and
upon his Hands and Leggs; and thus chain'd and manacled,
he order'd him to be led about for five Months together,
to be &s;een by the People. After that he was &s;hut up in a
clo&s;e Pri&s;on, where he remain'd &s;even years, till the death
of the King, who&s;e Son coming to the Throne, &s;et him at
liberty, upon condition he &s;hould &s;erve as a private Souldier
upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom. As for the Prince&s;s
&s;he was &s;hut up in a little Chamber upon the top of a
Tow'r, where &s;he remain'd twelve days without having
any thing given her to eat or drink; after that the Chamber
<PB N="21" REF="27">
was all uncover'd at the top, that the &s;un might come at
her, and &s;corch her to death, and &s;o &s;he di'd in three days.
The two Maids that &s;erv'd her had a little more favour, for
they were thrown to the Elephants, who pre&s;ently trod
them to death. The two Porters of the Che&s;t, or Flasket,
were ti'd to four &s;mall Galleys, by the two Hands, and
two Leggs, and as they Row'd &s;everal ways were pre|&s;ently
di&s;membred. Being at <HI>Daca,</HI> in the Kingdom of

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Vi&s;its, Feasts, and Pastimes of the
Tunquine&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>AMong all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are the
mo&s;t &s;ociable, and mo&s;t frequently vi&s;it one ano|ther.
Generally they make their Vi&s;its about Noon,
in the hotte&s;t time of the day, and then every one walks
with a Train &s;uitable to his Condition. The Princes and
<HI>Mandarines</HI> ride upon their Elephants, or el&s;e they are carri'd
in a kind of Litter, where they may either &s;it or lie. Six
Men carry it, and behind them follow &s;ix more to ea&s;e them
by times. Their Train con&s;i&s;ts generally of fifty or &s;ixty
Per&s;ons; neither are they permitted to exceed that number.
As for the ordinary Gentry, and Officers of the Court, they
ride a Hor&s;e-back, not being allow'd above &s;even or eight
Servants to attend them. They chew, <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> continually, as
all the other <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> do in &s;uch places where it is to be had.
And when any one comes to vi&s;it another, it would be
taken for a great affront, if at his taking leave, he &s;hould
not be pre&s;ented with a Box of <HI>Betl&egrave;,</HI> to take what he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>The richer that Box is, the more Honour is given to the
Per&s;on to whom the <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> is pre&s;ented: In&s;omuch that when
a Prince is about to be marri'd, he u&s;ually &s;ends three of
the&s;e Boxes to his Spou&s;e, of which I have &s;een &s;ome at
<PB N="22" REF="28">
the Apartments of &s;ome of the Princes that came to the
Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> which were worth above 4 or
500000 <HI>Livres:</HI> One &s;hall be cover'd with Diamonds, ano|ther
with Rubies and Pearls, another with Emraulds and
Pearls, or el&s;e with other Jewels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> take it for a great di&s;honour to have their
Heads bare, which is only for Criminals, whom they cau&s;e
to be &s;hav'd &s;o &s;oon as they are taken. So that it is a diffi|cult
thing for a Criminal to e&s;cape the hands of Ju&s;tice, for
wherever they go, when they find that a man has no Hair,
he is taken and carri'd to the Governour, who cau&s;es him to
be nail'd to a Cro&s;s immediately.</P>
<P>They &s;it cro&s;s legg'd, after the manner of the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI>
People. At great mens Hou&s;es, in the Halls, where they
receive their Vi&s;its, there is as it were an <HI>Alcove,</HI> with a kind
of a Bed&s;ted rais'd about a foot from the ground. It is
cover'd with a very fine Mat, made of little Reeds bound
together, as it were with fine thread. For it is not the
Cu&s;tom to &s;pread Carpets upon the Floors, as in other
Countries of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Not that the deerne&s;s hinders them from
making u&s;e of them, for the&s;e Mats co&s;t them more then a
fine <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Carpet would do, but becau&s;e they are
cooler to &s;it upon, and becau&s;e the <HI>Punies</HI> do not get &s;o ea&s;ily
into them. Being at <HI>Bantam</HI> I bought one of the&s;e Mats of
a <HI>Tunquine&s;e,</HI> which was admir'd for its finene&s;s. It was nine
Ells &s;quare, and as even and as &s;oft as Velvet. With the&s;e
Mats they cover the Beds or Couches, upon which the <HI>Man|darins,</HI>
or <HI>Princes,</HI> and the Nobilty which accompany them,
&s;eat them&s;elves round the Chamber, every one having one
Cu&s;hion under him, and another at his Back.</P>
<P>As for their Diet the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are not very curious. The
Common People are contented with Rice boil'd in water,
and dri'd Fi&s;h, or &s;alted Eggs. For as for Fle&s;h they eat
none but at their Fe&s;tivals. The great Lords are &s;erv'd every
day with Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, but their Cooks know not what
belongs to bak'd Meats. Otherwi&s;e they are more neat in
their Kitchins and Chambers then we, only they make no
u&s;e either of Napkins or Table-cloaths. Whatever is &s;et
before them to eat, is &s;erv'd in little Plates, not &s;o big as
our Trenchers, being made of wood lacker'd with all &s;orts
of Flow'rs, like the Cabinets which are brought from <HI>Japan.</HI>
<PB REF="28">
<PB REF="29">
<PB N="23" REF="29">
All the&s;e Plates are brought up, rang'd in order, in a large
Voyder, lacker'd like the Plates. U&s;ually the Voyder holds
ten or twelve Plates, and the Meat is cut in little pieces,
about the bigne&s;s of a Hazle Nut. They make u&s;e neither
of Spoons, nor Knives, nor Forks, but only of tho&s;e little
Sticks, of which I have made mention in the foregoing
Chapter, never touching their Meat with their fingers.</P>
<P>When there are &s;everal &s;itting at the Table, either at their
ordinary Meals, or upon &s;ome Fe&s;tival, they account it a
great piece of Manners to be &s;ilent; or if they have a de&s;ire
to Di&s;cour&s;e, they alway allow the Elde&s;t the honour of
beginning, bearing a great re&s;pect to them that are aged.
But the Younge&s;t, at the Table, is never permitted to begin
the Di&s;cour&s;e. They wa&s;h their Hands, their Mouths, and
Faces before they &s;it down, but never after Meals. And
when they de&s;ire to know whether every one has had his
fill, they ask him whether he have eaten his Rice, according
to the Cu&s;tom of the Ancient Fathers in Scripture, who, by
Bread, meant the whole Repa&s;t. Neither is it a Cu&s;tom
among them to ask one another how they do? but how
many Mea&s;ures of Rice he eat for his Dinner, and whether
he eat with an Appetite. This is a general Cu&s;tom among
all the Idolatrous <HI>Indians,</HI> unle&s;s in the Dominions of the
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where they eat not Rice only, but Bread, and
there they ask in civility how much Rice they boil'd, and
how much Meal they bak'd for Bread; for the more he eats,
the better in health they think a man is.</P>
<P>Among all the Pa&s;times of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> there are none
wherein they take &s;o much delight as in Comedies, which
are only Acted in the Night-time; but tho&s;e which are pre|&s;ented
the day that they fir&s;t behold the new Moon are the
be&s;t. They la&s;t from Sun-&s;etting to Sun-ri&s;ing, and they
are &s;et out with beautiful Decorations and Machines, very
plea&s;ing to behold. They are excellently well skill'd in
repre&s;enting the Sea and Rivers, and making a &s;hew of Sea-fights,
and Combats between Galleys and Barks, though
they have &s;eldom more then eight Actors, Men and Women.
The places appointed for the&s;e &s;ights, are great Halls, the
third part whereof the Theater takes up, the re&s;t being fill'd
with Benches for the Spectators. Upon each &s;ide of the
Theater is a Box very &s;umptuou&s;ly &s;et out, re&s;erv'd for the
<PB N="24" REF="30">
King when he plea&s;es to come. The Actors and Actre&s;&s;es
are very magnificently clad. The dre&s;s for the Womens
heads being a kind of Miter or Diadem, which exceedingly
becomes them, from the hinder part whereof two Ribonds,
three fingers broad, hang down below their wa&s;ts. Both
the one and the other Act their parts very perfectly, and,
according to their manner, ob&s;erve an exact time in their
Dancing.</P>
<P>At one of the corners of the Hall &s;it the two Judges of
the Comedy, one of whom beats time upon a Bra&s;s Drum.
Their other ordinary Pa&s;times, e&s;pecially for the Lords and
<HI>Mandarins,</HI> are Fi&s;hing and Hunting, though they take
more plea&s;ure in the former, by rea&s;on of the plenty of
Fi&s;h which their Rivers afford them. But, as I &s;aid before,
they follow the&s;e &s;ports only upon the days that are permit|ted
them, as being better husbands of their time then we, not
&s;paring any part of it from bu&s;ine&s;s. So that they who at the
beginning of that little knowledge which we had of the&s;e
People, wrote that their Manners and Cu&s;toms were wild and
barbarous, were mi&s;inform'd. For as there is no rea&s;on to doubt
of the truth of what I affirm, and what others have confirm'd
by other Relations, we may well conculde from what I have
&s;aid, That all the Duties of Civil Society and Politene&s;s are
not confin'd within our <HI>Europe;</HI> but that the Kingdom of <HI>Tun|quin,</HI>
anciently a part of <HI>China,</HI> &s;till retains the good Govern|ment
and Civility of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Learned Men in the Kingdom of
Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>CErtain it is, that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have a very great
inclination for Learning, and that they apply them|&s;elves
to their Studies with diligence and &s;ucce&s;s:
for that they cannot be advanc'd without it to the Offices
and Dignities in the Kingdom. I do not here, by Learning,
mean the under&s;tanding of the Languages of our Learned
<PB N="25" REF="30">
Men of <HI>Europe,</HI> which are altogether unknown to the
Ea&s;tern People, and much le&s;s the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI>
of which they never &s;o much as heard. But we mean the
knowledge of the Laws of their Country, by means
whereof they obtain the charges of Judicature; the <HI>Mathe|maticks,</HI>
and particularly <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> to which all the Ori|entals
have a great inclination, as being great ob&s;ervers of
the Stars, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they flatter them&s;elves to be
able to foretel things to come. The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are al&s;o pa&s;&s;io|nate
lovers of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> as being great admirers
of <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Tragedy,</HI> of which tho&s;e two Sciences are
the main Compo&s;ition; &s;o that the Mu&s;icians and Actors
of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are accounted the be&s;t in the whole Ea&s;tern
part of the World.</P>
<P>That you may acquire Nobility by Learning, in your
Youth, you mu&s;t pa&s;s through three degrees, of the <HI>Synde,</HI>
the <HI>Doucan,</HI> and the <HI>Tan&s;i,</HI> from which degree you may
a&s;cend to that of the Nobility.</P>
<P>To attain the fir&s;t degree, it behoves the Youth of
<HI>Tunquin</HI> to apply them&s;elves for eight years together to their
Studies, and that very clo&s;e, to enable them&s;elves for the
Office of a Notary, Proctor, and Advocate, to which
there is nothing more conducing then to &s;peak Eloquently
in public. At the end of eight years, they are examin'd
concerning the duty of tho&s;e Employments; and if any
one fail to give an An&s;wer to the Que&s;tions propounded, he
is &s;ent back again as incapable to obtain any Employment
for the future, or to &s;tudy any longer. For tho&s;e that
acquit them&s;elves well of their Examination, which is
very rigorous, their Names are &s;et down in a Regi&s;ter,
and pre&s;ented to the King, who fir&s;t grants them the liberty
to take upon them the Title of <HI>Synde,</HI> and then if it be
their aim to enjoy the Quality of <HI>Doucan,</HI> they are com|manded
by the <HI>Tan&s;i</HI>'s to &s;tudy <HI>Mu&s;ic, A&s;trology,</HI> and <HI>Poe&s;ie,</HI>
not only to be able to be judge of it, but al&s;o to perform
them&s;elves upon occa&s;ion. For to be good judges of <HI>Co|medy,</HI>
which is a great Honour among them, it behoves
them to be both good Comedians and Mu&s;icians. Nor in|deed
is there any Pa&s;time more frequent then that of the
Theater in this Country; for there is never any &s;olemn
Fe&s;tival among them, which is not accompany'd and &s;et
<PB N="26" REF="31">
forth with Artificial Fire-works, in making whereof the&s;e
People are exqui&s;ite; after which they have their Come|dies,
with Machines, and change of Scenes in every Act.
Be&s;ides this, their Actors have a prodigious memory, &s;o
that let the part be never &s;o long, they never make u&s;e of
Prompters to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, as we do in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They that will learn the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> mu&s;t make their
own In&s;truments them&s;elves, and &s;pend five years in this
&s;tudy. They are examin'd every year, and if they fail
to an&s;wer &s;uch Que&s;tions as are ask'd them, for the fir&s;t
four they are pardon'd; but at the end of the five years,
if upon the grand Examination, they fail to an&s;wer the
Que&s;tions demanded them by the <HI>Tan&s;is,</HI> they are utterly
degraded; whereas if they &s;atisfie their Examinors, they
are permitted the Name and Dignity of <HI>Doucan.</HI> After
thirteen years thus &s;pent, before they can arrive to
the degree of a <HI>Tan&s;i,</HI> they mu&s;t &s;pend four years more in
learning to write and read the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Character to &s;uch a
certain number of Words. For the life of a Man would
not &s;uffice to learn to write and read the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> quite
through. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that as to this particu|lar,
it is not in <HI>China</HI> as in other Nations, where one Word
is compos'd of &s;everal Letters. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> for every
Word have a different Figure, all which Figures are very
numerous, as you may ea&s;ily conjecture. By the by let
me tell you, that the&s;e Figures are made with &s;mall Pen|cils,
and that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> make u&s;e of a certain Ink, which is
made up into a Pa&s;te, and &s;o moi&s;ten'd in Water as you make
u&s;e of it. They have al&s;o another &s;ort of Colour for certain
Words. But they cannot make u&s;e of Pens, as our <HI>Euro|peans,</HI>
which are made of Quils; nor of tho&s;e of other
Ea&s;tern People, which are made of &s;mall redi&s;h brown
Reeds, the be&s;t of which grow in certain Mer&s;hes in
the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Arachan.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Students of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> they are al&s;o
oblig'd to under&s;tand the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
as well as their own; and the la&s;t four years being at an
end, the la&s;t and great Examination is made in the great
place, within the Enclo&s;ure of the Palace of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> which
is a &s;tately Marble &s;tructure. There the King is pre&s;ent,
with the Princes and great Lords of the Court, the <HI>Mande|rins</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31">
for Learning, and all the <HI>Tan&s;is;</HI> and many al&s;o
come on purpo&s;e from di&s;tant Provinces to the Solemnity.
Some Relations of <HI>Tunquin</HI> have been a little too ridiculous
in this particular, a&s;&s;erting extravagantly; that &s;ome|times
there are above 30 or 40000 Students pre&s;ent at
the&s;e Examinations; but by what I could learn from my
Brother, or gather by that di&s;cour&s;e which I have had
with the Natives, the number of Students never exceeds
three thou&s;and. There are in the place nine Scaffolds &s;et
up; of which the one is for the King and Princes, the other
for the Examiners, and tho&s;e that are to be Examin'd: And
for the better hearing what is &s;aid, the Scaffolds are built
like an Amphitheater. But whereas there are eight days
&s;pent in this Examination, the King and the <HI>Mandarins</HI> are
never there but only the two fir&s;t days. The la&s;t day all
the Names of them who have been Examin'd, as well they
who have an&s;wer'd well, as of them that have falter'd,
are left in the Hands of the &s;ixteen chief <HI>Manderins,</HI> who
are as it were &s;ixteen Coun&s;ellors of State, and then it is
at the King's plea&s;ure to favour whom he thinks fit, of
tho&s;e who have not given full &s;atisfaction to the Que&s;tions
propounded to them. As for tho&s;e who were found very
ignorant, they are degraded with &s;hame, and there is no
more &s;aid of them. All tho&s;e Names are u&s;ually written
upon large Tables, &s;et up at the Gate of the King's Palace
for eight days together, to the end, that all the People may
know who are receiv'd into the Rank of <HI>Nobility,</HI> and
who not.</P>
<P>The eight days being pa&s;s'd, they are all to appear again
upon the &s;ame Scaffolds, where in the view of all the
World, they who have had the misfortune to have falter'd
in their Examinations, are di&s;mi&s;s'd as unworthy of any
Employment: while they who have behav'd them&s;elves
worthy of approbation, are honour'd with a Ve&s;t of Vio|let
Satin, which they pre&s;ently put on, and then take upon
them the Name of <HI>Tan&s;i's.</HI> Then they have given them a
Li&s;t of the Towns and Villages, where they are to receive the
Rents which the King allows them; wherein however they
have not an equal &s;hare; &s;ome being allow'd more, &s;ome le&s;s,
according to their merit, or the favour of the Prince.
Pre&s;ently they &s;end notice to the places a&s;&s;ign'd them of the
<PB N="28" REF="32">
time, at which they intend to be there: and then all the
Inhabitants come forth to meet them, in Honour of their
Dignity, with all &s;orts of Mu&s;ic, and a Guilded <HI>Branquar,</HI>
carried by eight Men. There they are permitted to &s;tay
three Months to divertize them&s;elves, and for their own
recreation. After that they return to Court, to in&s;truct
them&s;elves in the affairs of the Kingdom, and the King's
Hou&s;e, and to perfect them&s;elves in the knowledge of tho&s;e
things, which is the way to obtain the Dignity of a <HI>Man|darin.</HI>
All Emba&s;&s;adours who are &s;ent to the Princes ad|joyning,
e&s;pecially to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> are cho&s;en out of the&s;e
<HI>Tan&s;i's,</HI> among whom they always make choice of the
able&s;t, and not of the riche&s;t, the King allowing them
&s;ufficient to maintain their Port, and defray the expences
of the Emba&s;&s;y.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Phy&s;icians, and the Di&s;ea&s;es of the
Tunquine&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THe Phy&s;icians belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI>
do not make it their bu&s;ine&s;s much to &s;tudy Books;
&s;pending their Youth in &s;earching after the nature
and qualities of the Roots and Simples, and how to apply
them according to the nature of the Di&s;temper. But more
particularly they apply them&s;elves to the beating of the
Pul&s;e, and its diver&s;ity of Mea&s;ure, by which they chiefly
pretend to under&s;tand the cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and what
Remedy to make u&s;e of for cure. And therefore when
they go to feel a Pul&s;e, they feel it in &s;everal parts of the
Body; and according to the diver&s;ity of the part, and the
beating, they judge of the quality of the Di&s;temper.
Therefore upon their fir&s;t coming, they feel the Patient in
three places, fir&s;t upon their right &s;ides, and &s;econdly upon
their left. By the Pul&s;e which they feel upon the wri&s;t of
the right hand, they gue&s;s of the condition of the Lungs;
by that which they feel upon the Vein of the Arms, where
<PB N="29" REF="32">
generally People are let Blood, they gue&s;s at the Di&s;tem|pers
of the Stomach, and the Region of the Kidneys.
The Pul&s;e of the left Wri&s;t di&s;covers to them the condition
of the Heart: By that in the Veins of the left Arm, where
u&s;ually they let Blood, they are inform'd of the e&s;tate
of the Liver. By the Pul&s;es of the Temples, both right
and left, they give a more exqui&s;ite judgment of the Kid|neys.
They are very careful to count how many times a
Pul&s;e of a &s;ick Per&s;on beats in the time of one Re&s;piration;
and according to the&s;e &s;everal Pul&s;es, they tell you which
part of the Body is particularly di&s;temper'd, whether the
Heart; the Liver, or the Lungs; or whether the Di&s;tem|per
proceed from any outward cau&s;e, as from Cold, Sadne&s;s,
or any other di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They never make u&s;e of any other Remedies but of
Herbs and Roots, which they choo&s;e them&s;elves; there
being no di&s;tinction among them of <HI>Apothecary</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ician.</HI>
The&s;e Herbs they mingle &s;ometimes with a little Ginger,
which they boyl in Water, and give the Decoction, being
&s;train'd, to the Patient. They have very good Receipts
for the Purples, Epilep&s;ie, and &s;everal other Di&s;ea&s;es
which are accounted incurable in <HI>Europe.</HI> They make u&s;e
of <HI>China</HI> Ink to &s;top a Dy&s;entery, and for the cure of Wounds.
When the Sea Ebbs from the &s;hoar upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts, they
find upon the Sand a little &s;mall kind of Crabs, which dye
immediately, and by the heat of the Sun, which is there
extraordinary, become as hard as a Stone in a &s;hort time;
the&s;e the <HI>Tunquine&s;e</HI> Phy&s;icians beat to Powder, and give
to their Patients in Dy&s;enteries, and Feavers, &s;ometimes in
<HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> &s;ometimes in plain Water. They mightily ad|mire
the Herb <HI>Tea,</HI> which comes from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan;</HI>
which latter Country produces the be&s;t. It is brought to
them in Tin Pots clo&s;e &s;top'd, to keep out the Air. When
they would u&s;e it, they boyl a quantity of Water, accor|ding
to the proportion they intend to u&s;e, and when the
Water &s;eeths, throw a &s;mall quantity into it, allowing as
much as they can nip between their Thumb and fore Finger
to a Gla&s;s. This they pre&s;cribe to be drank as hot as they
can endure it, as being an excellent Remedy again&s;t the
Headach, for the Gravel, and for tho&s;e that are &s;ubject to
the Griping of the Guts; but then they order a little Ginger
<PB N="30" REF="33">
to be put into the Water when it boyls. At <HI>Goa, Batavia,</HI>
and in all the <HI>Indian</HI> Factories, there are none of the <HI>Euro|peans</HI>
who do not &s;pend above four or five Leaves a day; and
they are careful to pre&s;erve the boyl'd Leaf for an Evening
Sallad, with Sugar, Vinegar, and Oyl. That is accounted
the be&s;t <HI>Tea</HI> which colours the Water greene&s;t; but that
which makes the Water look Red, is little accounted of.
In <HI>Japan.</HI> The King and great Lords, who drink <HI>Tea,</HI> drink
only the Flower, which is much more whol&s;om, and of a
ta&s;t much more plea&s;ing. But the Price is much different;
for one of our ordinary Beer Gla&s;&s;es is there worth a <HI>French</HI>
Crown.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t dangeroug Di&s;tempers that befall the <HI>Tunqui|ne&s;es,</HI>
mo&s;t u&s;ually happen when the bad Air &s;urprizes
the People; for of a &s;udden it deprives them of their
Speech, and then Death &s;uddenly follows without a &s;peedy
Remedy. The be&s;t Remedy for this &s;udden Di&s;temper is
to mix &s;ome Counterpoi&s;on with <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> in&s;tead of Wine,
and to let the Patient drink it as hot as he can. The Patient
al&s;o, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be rub'd with a Cloth dip'd in
<HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> where Ginger has been boyl'd. This takes
away the pains caus'd by cold Winds, and unwhol&s;om Airs.
Though &s;ome for the more &s;peedy cure of the&s;e pains, lay
the Patient upon a Bed made only of Girts, four Fingers
di&s;tant one from the other; and then &s;etting a Cha&s;ing-di&s;h
underneath, cau&s;e the &s;ick Per&s;on to &s;weat in a Cloud of
Frankincen&s;e, till the pain is gone, repeating the &s;ame
thing Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>As for Blood-letting, it is by no means us'd in that Coun|try.
They make u&s;e of Fire, e&s;pecially for the Purple-Feaver,
a Di&s;ea&s;e &s;o dangerous in <HI>France.</HI> For the cure of
this, the Phy&s;itians of <HI>Tunquin</HI> take the Pith of a Reed,
which they dry very well; dip it in Oyl, and &s;et it on Fire:
and then apply to every Purple Spot one of the&s;e lighted
Wicks. The Spot will give a whif like a &s;mall Squib,
and that's an infallible &s;ign that the Venom is gone out of
the body. This Remedy is &s;eldom apply'd but in the
night time, becau&s;e the Spot does not appear &s;o well in
the day time. And the Phy&s;ician mu&s;t be very careful,
that when this Venom flies out of the Patient's Body, it does
not find a way into his own; for then there is no Remedy
<PB N="31" REF="33">
but Death. There are &s;ome Phy&s;icians that will prick the
Purple Spot with a Needle, and let out the Pe&s;tilential
Blood; after which they burn the part &s;o prick'd, and then
rub it with Ginger, not permitting their Patient to take
the Air in 20 days after they are cur'd. While they are
under cure, they drink nothing but Water, with Citron|peel
boyl'd in it, and ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h and Butter. They
give them to eat Rice boyl'd in Water, and &s;alt Fi&s;h; but
the more they ab&s;tain from eating and drinking, the &s;ooner
they are cur'd. And indeed it is a wonderful thing to &s;ee
the excellent effects of their Remedies in &s;o &s;hort a time;
for they have no lingring Di&s;tempers to hold them years
together, as they do among us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Original, Government, and Policy, of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not above &s;ix hundred years &s;ince <HI>Tunquin</HI> was fir&s;t
govern'd by particular Kings, in regard it was anciently
a part of the Dominion of the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> What is re|ported
of the fir&s;t <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> That they were without
Governours, and without Kings, is altogether fabulous,
like to that which is related of a certain Infant of three
years of Age, who appearing before a great A&s;&s;embly of
the People, exhorted them to free them&s;elves from the
power of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who were their Oppre&s;&s;ors. Upon
which a lovely Hor&s;e miraculou&s;ly appearing to the &s;aid
infant, he mounted the Hor&s;e, and immediately &s;etting for|ward
with tho&s;e that were gather'd after him, as al&s;o others
that appear'd as wonderfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, he &s;et upon the
<HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and defeated them in &s;uch manner, that they never
dur&s;t venture after that to return any more to reconquer
what they had lo&s;t. But the mo&s;t certain truth of <HI>Tun|quin</HI>
Hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us, That for the&s;e &s;ix Centuries la&s;t pa&s;t,
it has been govern'd by &s;ix various Families. The fir&s;t that
a&s;&s;um'd the Title of King was a famous Robber, who&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="34">
Name was <HI>Din,</HI> who having gather'd together a great
Number of Malecontents, and Vagabonds, became &s;o
powerful and formidable through his own Valour, that
after &s;everal bloody Battels gain'd, it was no difficult thing
for him to &s;eize upon the Throne. But he did not reign
long in peace, for the mo&s;t part of the People rebell'd
again&s;t him; and in the fir&s;t Battel that he fought, he lo&s;t
his Life. However his own Party won the day; and
having left two Sons, his elde&s;t reigned three years; after
who&s;e death, the younger Brother rul'd in his &s;tead, but
dy'd &s;oon after, neither of the Brothers leaving any i&s;&s;ue
behind them. After that the Kingdom was mi&s;erably
di&s;tracted by &s;everal Civil Wars, till the weaker Party
calling in the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, became the mo&s;t
pui&s;&s;ant. Then it was that a certain <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the
Family of <HI>Lelequel,</HI> was advanc'd to the Throne, who
being a valiant and prudent Prince, re&s;tor'd tranquillity to
the whole Kingdom. Who, when he &s;aw him&s;elf E&s;tabli&s;h'd
in peace, built that large Palace, which they, who have
&s;een it, admire, as well for it's Circuit, as for its magnificent
Structure, being all of Marble of divers Colours, both
within and without. This King had but one Daughter,
who &s;oon after her Father's death, the better to &s;ecure her
&s;elf, marry'd one of the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Mandarins</HI> in the
Country, of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Tran.</HI> But &s;oon after, one of
her Subjects rebelling again&s;t her, gave her battel, took
her Pri&s;oner, and put her to death. Having thus got the
Power into his hands, the Rebel u&s;urp'd the Throne; but
nine years after, he was al&s;o &s;lain in Battel by his own
Subjects, who had call'd the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.
They being thus Ma&s;ters of the Kingdom, held it for twenty
years, and &s;et Governours over every Province. But at
length the <HI>Mandarins</HI> grew weary of their Oppre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e
of the heavy Tributes which they laid upon the <HI>Tunquine&s;es;</HI>
&s;o that a valiant Captain of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le,</HI> having a&s;&s;embled
a numerous Power together, gave the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> three Battels,
and in every one overcame them. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> thus expell'd
out of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the Conquerour &s;eiz'd the Crown, and in
his Family the Regal Government continu'd for above four|&s;core
years. After which time, a great Lord, of the
Family of <HI>Marr,</HI> which had formerly enjoy'd the Scepter,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
to Revenge him&s;elf of an affront which the King had
put upon him at Court, found a way to e&s;cape his hands,
and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a great Number of di&s;contented Per|&s;ons,
of which the be&s;t regulated Kingdoms are always
full, and the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who always &s;ought an opportunity
to regain what they had lo&s;t, after a bloody Battel, he
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the Kingdom, it being never known
what became of his Predece&s;&s;or. But this new King en|joy'd
the Fruits of his Victory but a &s;mall while. For two
years afterwards, a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Trin,</HI>
having e&s;pous'd the Daughter of another great Lord, openly
declar'd War again&s;t his Soveraign, with a de&s;ign utterly to
extirpate the Hou&s;e of <HI>Marr.</HI> Unhappily for him, death put
a &s;top to his de&s;igns, though he left two Sons behind him,
able enough to have pur&s;u'd his undertakings. But the
elde&s;t, naturally timorous, and fearing to engage him&s;elf
in a dangerous War, voluntarily &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the
King, who gave him the Government of a Province, and
marry'd him to one of his Si&s;ter's Daughters. The younger
Brother being a valiant Prince, and having his decea&s;ed
Father's Army at his Devotion, though the King propos'd
him great advantages, would give ear to nothing, but out of
his ambition to Reign him&s;elf continu'd and &s;ucce&s;sfully ac|compli&s;h'd
what his Father had begun. In the &s;econd
Battel which he gave the King, who was there in per&s;on,
he took him Pri&s;oner, together with his Brother, who had
&s;ubmitted to him, and &s;ome few days after he put them both
publicly to death at the head of his Army; the one as an
unju&s;t u&s;urper of the Throne; the ether as a de&s;ertor, who
had abandon'd his Father's Army, and &s;o ill follow'd his
intentions.</P>
<P>Now though as Victor he might ea&s;ily have a&s;cended the
Throne, and tak'n upon him the Name and Title of King,
yet he would not accept of any higher Title then that of
General of the Army; and the better to E&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf
in his Authority, and to gain the affection of the People,
he caus'd Proclamation to be made through all the Provinces
of the Kingdom, that if there were any Prince of the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Le</HI> yet remaining alive, he &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf, with
full a&s;&s;urance that upon his appearing, he &s;hould be put into
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom. There was but one to be found,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
who had been &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd by the Hou&s;e or <HI>Marr,</HI>
while it rul'd, that to &s;ave his Life he was forc'd to ab&s;cond
him&s;elf in the Frontiers of the Kingdom, under the Habit
of a private Soldier. The General was overjoy'd to find
that there was yet a lawful Heir of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le</HI> to be
found, that he might place him upon the Throne. So that
&s;o &s;oon as he was known to be of the Legitimate Race, all
the Equipage and Attendance of a King was &s;ent to him,
with Order to all the Provinces as he pa&s;s'd along, to receive
him as if he were already crown'd. The whole Army
march'd two days march to meet the King, and brought
him to <HI>Checo,</HI> the capital City of the Kingdom, where he
was plac'd in the Throne of his Father, and with great
Pomp proclaim'd King of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> But General <HI>Trin,</HI> who
car'd not &s;o much for the Royal Title, as the Royal Power,
&s;o order'd his bu&s;ine&s;s, that leaving to <HI>Le</HI> all the outward
&s;hew and Pomp of Royal Authority, he re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf
the whole command of the Army, and the greate&s;t part of
the Revenues of the Kingdom ab&s;olutely to di&s;po&s;e of at
his own plea&s;ure. So that from that time to this hour, we
may affirm that there has been, and &s;till are, two Kings of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which the fir&s;t has only the Name and Title of
King, and is call'd <HI>Bo&uuml;a,</HI> and the &s;econd <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> who has
all the Authority, di&s;po&s;ing of all things at his plea&s;ure,
while the other remains &s;hut up in his Palace like a Slave,
not permitted to &s;tir abroad but upon certain days: and
then he is carry'd through the Streets of <HI>Checo,</HI> like an Image,
though with a magnificent Train and Royal Equipage. He
has generally 2000 Soldiers for his Guard; and &s;ometimes
20000 which are quarter'd upon the Frontiers, chiefly to|ward
<HI>Cochinchina.</HI> He al&s;o has ready upon the Frontiers 50
Elephants for War. And upon the Rivers of the Kingdom
where the Enemy can come to damage him, he u&s;ually
keeps 100 great Galleys, with a va&s;t company of &s;mall
Galliots, to which the Soldiers and Rowers that belong,
have more pay then the others at Land. And the&s;e, that
they may row with more &s;trength, row &s;tanding, with
their Faces toward the Prow, quite contrary to our Row|ers,
who turn their backs.</P>
<P>The King gives public Audience almo&s;t every day; but
he makes no Edict, or public Decree, that is of any effect,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
if it be not al&s;o Sign'd by the <HI>Cho&uuml;a.</HI> At the&s;e Audiences
he has with him thirty two Councellors of State, and be&s;ides
the&s;e, a hundred others to judge of all Appeals of the
Kingdom. The Eunuchs have a very great Power at Court,
as in all other Courts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the King, as to his mo&s;t
important affairs, confides more in them then in his own
Children. The elde&s;t Children do not always &s;ucceed
their Father; for the <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> or General, with all the Coun|cellors,
which are generally his Creatures, thought it con|venient,
that when the King &s;hould have more Sons then
one, he &s;hould make choice of whom he pleas'd to &s;ucceed
him. So that &s;o &s;oon as he has nam'd him, the <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI>
attended by the principal Officers of the Army, Councellors
of State, and Eunuchs, come to congratulate him, and
to give him their Oaths to &s;et him upon the Throne after
the death of his Father; and for the other Brothers they
are always &s;hut up in the Palace, as in a Pri&s;on, without
medling with any affairs of State. They never &s;tir out of
the Palace but four times a year, and they never &s;tay
abroad above &s;ix days at a time, the Officers that attend them
being put upon them by the <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> who is as it were Lord
high Con&s;table of the Kingdom. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ix
days of liberty they go to vi&s;it the Temples, and the Prie&s;ts,
to whom they give large Alms; the two next days they
take their plea&s;ure in hunting; and the three la&s;t days they
&s;pend their time upon the Rivers, in Galleys &s;umptuou&s;ly
trimm'd and adorn'd.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> is divided into eight large Pro|vinces,
every one of which has its Governour, and its Ma|gi&s;trates,
from who&s;e &s;entence there lies an Appeal to the
Court. We &s;hould wrong this Country to &s;ay that there
were no Nobility therein; as indeed there are none in mo&s;t
Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> But they mu&s;t all attain to this degree
their merit; &s;ome by the Warrs, and &s;ome by their Learning.
They who attain their Nobility by Arms, have wherewithall
to live hand&s;omly at home; and they begin to learn their
Exerci&s;es betimes, at farthe&s;t by eleven or twelve years of
Age. The fir&s;t thing they are to under&s;tand, is how to
handle their Swords; the Blades of which are &s;treight,
long, and broad, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> having but
one Edge. They are al&s;o taught to aim with their Bows,
<PB N="36" REF="36">
and to fire a Musket with Matches, (for they know not
the u&s;e of Fire-Locks) to ride the great Hor&s;e, to &s;hoot
running, and to manage their <HI>Zagay's,</HI> which are a &s;ort
of Staves, cheek'd with Iron, like a Half-Pike. When
they are ready in all the&s;e Exerci&s;es, then they learn to
make all &s;orts of Artificial Fire-works; as al&s;o how to in|vent
new ones, to make u&s;e of them again&s;t the Elephants. By
the way I mu&s;t needs tell you, there are &s;ome of the&s;e Ele|phants
as I have &s;een &s;everal times, that are &s;o accu&s;tom'd
to the&s;e Artificial Fires, that they regard them not at all,
neither are any way di&s;turb'd at the Squibs that are thrown,
and go off under their very No&s;es and Bellies. Neverthe|le&s;s
of 200 of the&s;e Creatures which the Ea&s;tern Kings
carry to their Wars at a time, you &s;hall have hardly fifteen
that are &s;o hardy and valiant. So that unle&s;s their Gover|nours
take not great care, in&s;tead of running upon the
Enemy, they turn upon their Friends, and put the whole
Army into a mo&s;t di&s;mal confu&s;ion; as you &s;hall hear by
the following Story. For <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> the pre&s;ent
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> being then a young Prince, obtain'd of
<HI>Cha-gehan,</HI> his Father, to let him have the command of
an Army of three&s;core thou&s;and Men, and four&s;core Ele|phants;
and with this force, out of his Antipathy to the
Chri&s;tians, he laid Siege to <HI>Daman,</HI> a Town belonging to
the <HI>Portugals,</HI> fourteen Leagues from <HI>Surat.</HI> The Gover|nour
was a per&s;on of great Valour, and had al&s;o two Sons
with him, who, together with him&s;elf, had both &s;erv'd
the King of <HI>France.</HI> He had al&s;o in the Town eight hun|dred
Gentlemen, who voluntarily put them&s;elves into the
Garri&s;on for its defence, from all parts of <HI>India</HI> where the
<HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had to do, and were all excellently well mounted.
For the <HI>Portugals</HI> at that time made u&s;e of none but <HI>Arabian</HI>
Hor&s;es, the wor&s;t of which co&s;t a thou&s;and Crowns at lea&s;t.
The Governour finding that the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince began to pre&s;s
hard upon him, having already made two A&s;&s;aults, re&s;olv'd
with all his Cavalry and Infantry to make a Salley upon <HI>Sun|day</HI>
Morning, cau&s;ing them to fix at the ends of their Spears
and Lances certain Artificial Fire-works, to which they were
order'd &s;uddenly to give fire, as &s;oon as they &s;hould gain
the Elephants Quarter. This de&s;ign was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that
when it came to be executed, the Elephants were &s;o &s;uddenly
<PB N="37" REF="36">
terrifi'd, that running impetuou&s;ly through the <HI>Indian</HI> Army,
they trod to the ground, and cut in pieces with the Swords
and Scithes which were fa&s;ten'd to their Trunks, what ever
&s;tood in their way. The <HI>Portugals</HI> taking advantage of this
confu&s;ion, made no le&s;s havock among the amazed Multi|tude,
whom they had &s;urpriz'd &s;ecurely and profoundly
a&s;leep. For they had an opinion, that the <HI>Portugals</HI> would
never attack them upon the Sabboth day, believing they
had the &s;ame veneration for that day which the <HI>Jews</HI> had.
But they were utterly deceiv'd, in &s;o much that the <HI>Portu|gals,</HI>
by virtue of this Stratagem &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, obtain'd
a notable Victory, to the utter de&s;truction of 20000 of
<HI>Aurenge-Zebe</HI>'s Army, the &s;poils whereof are reported to
have amounted to above twelve Millions.</P>
<P>But to return to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you,
that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have often wag'd War again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
becau&s;e the fir&s;t would not pay the latter the Tribute which
was accorded them by a Treaty made by one of their Kings,
of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le.</HI> But in the year 1667, the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
&s;eeing that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their
Country, made a Peace with the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> wherein it
was agreed, that the &s;aid Tribute &s;hould be no longer paid;
but that they &s;hould every year &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador only to
<HI>Pequin,</HI> to do homage to the Emperour of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Ju&s;tice and Policy, they ob&s;erve a very exact
Order and Regulation over all the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> as
well in their Cities, as in the Country. So that few of the
be&s;t regulated Kingdoms exceed them. More e&s;pecially
they have a great care, for the public good, to repair the
Bridges and High-ways; and every quarter of a League
there is &s;uch Provi&s;ion made, that any Traveller may there
meet not only with Water, but Fire al&s;o to light his Pipe,
being generally great &s;moakers of Tobacco.</P>
<P>As for Murder, they are very exact in puni&s;hing that
crime. For they carry the Per&s;on apprehended before
the Judge; and then he mu&s;t hold to his Mouth a little wi&s;p
of Gra&s;s, to &s;hew, that by his di&s;orderly life he had made
him&s;elf a Bea&s;t. Not much unlike this is the cu&s;tom in
<HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the King and his Council condemn or pardon
all but &s;uch as have murder'd a Man that has any Kindred.
For then all the favour that the King can &s;hew him is, to
<PB N="38" REF="37">
deliver him into the hands of the next of kin to the Per&s;on
kill'd, who has power to agree with the Criminal for a Sum
of Money, which is rarely done, as being accounted an
Act both infamous and ignominious. So that if there be
no agreement made, then it behoves the next of kin to be
the Executioner him&s;elf, and put the Criminal to that death
to which he is before condemn'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Court of the Kings of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough the King, as I have already &s;aid, have
not much Authority in his Kingdom, which is
govern'd altogether by the General, who has the
whole <HI>Militia</HI> at his Devotion, yet he is highly honour'd by
his Subjects, and he keeps a very &s;plendid Court. The
fir&s;t and fifteenth day of every Month, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI>
who are the Grandees of the Kingdom, are bound to come
in their <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Habits to ki&s;s the King's hands. The Con|&s;table,
or General, was formerly wont to perform the
&s;ame Office, but by degrees he has obtain'd a di&s;pen&s;ation,
and only &s;ends another Prince in his &s;tead. As for all the
other <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Governours of Provinces, Ju&s;ticiaries,
and Military Officers, every year they go to ki&s;s the <HI>Cho&uuml;a</HI>'s
hands, and to congratulate him upon the fir&s;t day of the
year, which is the fifteenth of the fifth Month; as al&s;o when
he has obtain'd any great Victory over his Enemies. So
that the General has more Honour done him then the King
him&s;elf. 'Tis al&s;o the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> among
the Men, that when they meet any Per&s;on higher in condi|tion
then them&s;elves, they make four profound obey&s;ances
to the very Earth. But for the Women, what ever their
condition be among them&s;elves, they never make but one.
They who are de&s;irous to be admitted into the Palace to &s;ee
the King, are oblig'd to put on Violet Robes, and their
Servants mu&s;t be clad in the &s;ame colour. They that ap|proach
the King's pre&s;ence to obtain any favour, mu&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="37">
carry a Pre&s;ent along with him. For though the Con&s;table
be the per&s;on that di&s;po&s;es of all Offices and Commands
over all the Court and Kingdom, yet every year upon the
fifteenth day of the &s;eventh Month, the King di&s;tributes
&s;everal con&s;iderable Gifts and Large&s;&s;es to his Courtiers; as
al&s;o to the Children of &s;uch Fathers who have perform'd
any important Service for the good of his Kingdom. He
gives them Pains of Gold, every one worth &s;ix hundred
<HI>Livres;</HI> and Bars of Silver, amounting each to forty &s;ix
<HI>Livres.</HI> The &s;ame day he al&s;o relea&s;es all Pri&s;oners, both
Criminal and Debtors, provided the crime do not de&s;erve
death; and that the debt do not exceed two Bars of Silver.
Al&s;o every year, the three la&s;t days of the la&s;t Month, the
40 <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who are the chief Councellors of State, take
the Oaths of all the Lords and Officers of the Court, and of
their Wives; cau&s;ing them to &s;wear to be faithful to the
King, and if they know of any thing that concerns the
King's per&s;on, or his Kingdom, to di&s;cover it. All Go|vernours
of Provinces give the &s;ame Oaths to the Lords and
Gentlemen under their Juri&s;dictions; and the Governours
of Cities to the Citizens, and other Inhabitants. They
that di&s;cover any Trea&s;on never fail of any reward; only
with this di&s;tinction, in reference to the quality of the Per|&s;ons
that reveal it. For as for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Gentle|men,
the King rewards them according to his own plea|&s;ure:
But as for the meaner &s;ort, whether Men or Women,
they are ennobl'd, and gratifi'd with a reward of 50 Pains
of Gold, and 500 Bars of Silver, which in all amounts to
53000 <HI>Livres.</HI> But they e&s;teem their Nobility far beyond
their Money.</P>
<P>At certain times of the year, there is a Mu&s;ter of the
Youth of the &s;everal Provinces; and all tho&s;e who are
found not to be either of the Nobility, or not to have learnt
any Trade, are pre&s;ently enroll'd for the Service of the
King, who every five years make choice of &s;uch as he in|tends
for his Guard, and &s;ends them to the Frontier Garri|&s;ons.
There are &s;ome who endeavour to get off by Money;
but if they be di&s;cover'd, both the Officers and the Soldier
are puni&s;h'd without redemption. For they hang a little
Bell about his Neck, Fetter his Arms, and in that po&s;ture
&s;end him to the Con&s;table, who pre&s;ently orders his Head
<PB N="40" REF="38">
to be &s;truck off. But in regard the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are very aver&s;e
from &s;eeing any Blood &s;hed, the Kindred or Friends of the
condemn'd Per&s;on, intercede that he may be hang'd, be|lieving
that death to be mo&s;t honourable which is not defil'd
with Blood-&s;hed; wherein they &s;eem to be of the Opinion
of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ceremonies ob&s;erv'd when the Kings of
Tunquin are advanc'd to the Throne.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we &s;peak of the Enthroning the Kings of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> and of the Ceremonies that attend it, it
behoves us to relate the manner of their &s;etting out
of the Palace, when they go at any time to take their plea|&s;ure.
The King is &s;eated upon a mo&s;t magnificent <HI>Palan|quin,</HI>
carry'd by eight Men, where he may be beheld by
all the People; the Lords and Officers of the Court attend|ing
him on foot, provided he do not go out of the City:
for when he goes into the Country he rides upon an Ele|phant,
and the Lords follow him on Hor&s;e-back. When
the Queen Mother, or his fir&s;t Wife go abroad, they are
likewi&s;e carry'd upon a clo&s;e <HI>Palanquin,</HI> with Lattice-Win|dows,
to the end, they may &s;ee and not be &s;een; and
behind the <HI>Palanquin</HI> follow the Maids of Honour on foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and great Princes, &s;olemnize their Birth|days
every year, with great Fea&s;ting, Pa&s;times, Come|dies,
and Fire-works, and all their Friends and Kindred
fail not to attend them to honour the Solemnities. In the
year 1645, the elde&s;t Son of the King, who was by his
Father appointed for his Succe&s;&s;or, upon one of his Birth|days
&s;hew'd the Court all the divertizements he could
imagin, and the King who had a great affection for him,
&s;ent him a thou&s;and Pains of Gold, and five hundred Bars
of Silver, to the value of 120000 <HI>Livres.</HI> At which
time, large Alms are di&s;tributed, e&s;pecially to poor Widows
and Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="38">
When the King dies, and leaves &s;everal Sons, they &s;et up
him whom (when alive) he cho&s;e for his Succe&s;&s;or. The
third day after the Decea&s;e of the King, the Con&s;table with
all the Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> the Lords of the Council, and
all the Governours of Provinces, repair to the Prince's Ap|partment,
where they pre&s;ent him with a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Habit, af|ter
which having mounted him upon an Elephant, they
bring him into one of the great Courts of his Palace, which
is all covered with Cloth of Gold and Silver as with a Tent.
There it is, that being placed upon a Throne magnifi|cently
enrich'd, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> pro&s;trate them&s;elves up|on
the Earth with their Heads downward; in which po|&s;ture
having lain for &s;ome time, they ri&s;e, and clo&s;ing their
Hands together, with their Arms and Eyes lifted up to Hea|ven,
they &s;wear to the new King to be faithful to him till
death. This fir&s;t Ceremony being over, the new King, to
&s;hew him&s;elf liberal upon his fir&s;t coming to the Crown,
cau&s;es four Panes of Gold, and &s;ix Bars of Silver, to be gi|ven
to every one. But to di&s;tingui&s;h the Con&s;table from
the re&s;t, he gives him twenty Panes of Gold, and forty Bars
of Silver: and to the Pre&s;ident of the Council or Chancel|lour
ten of Gold and twenty of Silver. The&s;e Pre&s;ents be|ing
thus made, &s;everal Pieces of Artillery are fired round
the Palace, accompanied with &s;everal Volleys of &s;mall
Shot, there being then in Arms above 30000 Hor&s;e and
Foot; and then the King is &s;et upon a magnificent <HI>Palan|quin,</HI>
and the Con&s;table and chief of the Council ride before
upon lovely Hor&s;es. Sixteen of the principal Officers of the
Court carry the King, <HI>viz.</HI> eight Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and
eight of the Council. And in this manner they &s;et forward
to the Apartment of the decea&s;ed King, from whence all
the Lords retire for two hours, except the Eunuchs; and
then it is, that the Prince&s;&s;es, Ladies of the Court, and chief
Wives of the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> come to ki&s;s the King's Hand, and
congratulate his Advancement to the Throne. Which
done, all the Lords return again to a noble Fea&s;t after the
manner of the Countrey ready prepar'd. Their Viands are
not &s;o delicate, nor &s;o deliciou&s;ly dre&s;s'd as ours, neither
have they &s;o much variety. 'Tis true, they have tho&s;e
<HI>Birds-nests,</HI> already mention'd, which they mix in the mo&s;t
part of their Di&s;hes, which gives the Meat a ta&s;t of
<PB N="42" REF="39">
almo&s;t all &s;orts of Spices. Of all the Meats which they eat
Colts Fle&s;h is in mo&s;t e&s;teem, and Dogs Fle&s;h, neither of
which agree with our Palates. The Fe&s;tival is concluded
with Comedies and Fireworks, which la all&s;t the night.
The next day the 30000 Men that gave their Volleys of
&s;mall Shot the day before, are drawn up in good order in a
Field next, and all the principal Officers of War, Colonels,
Captains, and Lieutenants, leave the Frontiers to be at the
&s;ame place. Then the King mounted upon his <HI>Palanquin,</HI>
and carried by &s;ixteen of his principal Officers, the Con&s;ta|ble
and grand Squire riding before, and attended by &s;everal
other Commanders on foot, with &s;everal Mummers that
play and dance before the <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> goes forth of his Pa|lace,
the Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, and other Warlike In|&s;truments,
filling the Air with their Martial Sounds. In
this Pomp, and with this Equipage, the King being come
to the Camp, quits his <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and mounts one of his
great Elephants of War, which are us'd to the noi&s;e of the
Guns and &s;ight of the Fireworks. Being thus mounted, he
rides into the middle of all his Troops, in which place all
the Officers &s;wear Fidelity to him; after which he be&s;tows
his Gifts upon them, to every Colonel two Panes of Gold,
and forty Bars of Silver; to every Captain the half of what
he gives a Colonel, and to every Lieutenant the half of what
he gives a Captain: and as for the Souldiers, they have
every one a Moneths Pay. The&s;e Pre&s;ents being made, the
whole Army di&s;charges three Volleys, and then every Com|pany
retreats into a large Hutt, where they have Meat and
Drink prepar'd for them, enough to &s;erve them a whole
day and a night. In the &s;ame Field is al&s;o &s;et up a fair woo|den
Palace, &s;umptuou&s;ly enriched within with Paintings
and &s;everal pieces of Workman&s;hip in Gold. There the
King &s;pends all the night, &s;ome part in Fea&s;ting, &s;ome part
in Plays and &s;eeing the Mummers dance, and the re&s;t in be|holding
the Fireworks. The next day the King leaves his
wooden Palace, which is afterwards fir'd by the Souldiers,
as well as their own Hutts, and &s;o returns to the City. Be|ing
arrived at his Palace with the &s;ame pomp that he went
forth, he &s;eats him&s;elf upon his Throne, and there &s;hews his
Liberality to tho&s;e that made the Fireworks, to the Come|dians
and Dancers, and all the re&s;t that were any way con|tributory
<PB N="43" REF="39">
to the &s;etting forth the Pomp of the Ceremony.
Then he gives Acce&s;s to all the People, and two Commi&s;&s;i|oners,
one for the Merchants, and the other for the Handi|crafts,
make a Speech to the King, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof is;
that all the Burge&s;&s;es and Inhabitants of the good City of
<HI>Checo</HI> do acknowledge him for their King, and that they will
be faithful to him till death. The Speech being ended, the
King pre&s;ents the Body of the Merchants with 50 Panes of
Gold, and 300 Bars of Silver; and the Body of the Trade&s;|men
with 20 Panes of Gold, and 100 Bars of Silver. The
People gone home, every one &s;trives who &s;hall &s;pend mo&s;t
in Fea&s;ting and Comedies, adding of their own to the Kings
Bounty; &s;o that every Quarter of the City is full of Jollity
and Rejoycing for a week together. Some days after come
the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Commonalty, from all parts of
the Kingdom, who in the behalf of their Cities and Towns
make known to His Maje&s;ty the univer&s;al Joy of the People
for their lawful Prince, a&s;&s;uring him of their Fidelity, and of
their Service again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> They name particularly
the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have no greater Ene|mies
then they, and for that the Hatred between them is ir|reconcileable.
The King ob&s;erving the good will of his Peo|ple,
te&s;tifies his Acknowledgment in this manner: All
that have not time out of mind been Rebels to their lawful
Sovereigns, but have con&s;tantly taken up Arms for their
Defence, are di&s;charged for a year from all Taxes and Im|po&s;itions;
and for the re&s;t, who have at any time formerly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Enemy, they are onely exempted for &s;ix moneths.
All Pri&s;oners for Debt partake al&s;o of the King's Bounty, &s;o
that after the Pre&s;ident of the Council has made a Compo|&s;ition
with the Creditors for half the Summe, the King pays
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a thing almo&s;t incredible, what a va&s;t number of Sa|crifices
the King &s;ends to the Temples of his fal&s;e Gods, to
be there offer'd to the Idols.</P>
<P>The number of Bea&s;ts is &s;aid to exceed an hundred thou|&s;and,
be&s;ides the value of a million in Panes of Gold, Ti&s;&s;ues,
and Silks, to adorn the Idols, and Orange-coloured Calicuts
for the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and tho&s;e that attend the Service of the <HI>Pa|gods.</HI>
Among the re&s;t of the&s;e Pre&s;ents he &s;ends a va&s;t num|ber
of Pieces of blue Calicuts for the poor people that are
<PB N="44" REF="40">
kept in the <HI>Pagods,</HI> as our Poor are kept in Ho&s;pitals. The
Idolatrous Princes al&s;o con&s;ume incredible Summes to adorn
the <HI>Pagods</HI> and Images of their fal&s;e Gods. There are &s;ome
of them three foot high, all of ma&s;&s;y Gold; others of Silver
bigger than the Life.</P>
<P>The new King after all the&s;e Ceremonies are over, takes
his time to go and give thanks to his fal&s;e Deities for his co|ming
to the Crown when the Moon fir&s;t changes, &s;hutting
him&s;elf up for the fir&s;t week with the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and living in
common with them with a great deal of Frugality.</P>
<P>During this time he vi&s;its the principal Ho&s;pitals, to &s;ee
how the poor people are us'd, e&s;pecially the old Folks,
whom they have in great Veneration, to whom he di&s;tri|butes
new Alms; for naturally the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are very
charitable. To conclude, he makes choice of &s;ome fair
Situation, where he orders the building of a new <HI>Pagod,</HI>
which he devotes to &s;ome of his Idols. Thus his Devotion
being ended, upon the fir&s;t day of the &s;econd Quarter, he
mounts one of his Elephants of War, attended by all the
Officers of his Court on Hor&s;e-back, and ten or twelve
thou&s;and men on foot, cho&s;en out of the whole Army to
attend him. All the &s;econd Quarter the whole Court &s;ays
in a certain Plain, where are three Hou&s;es &s;et up, one for
the King, one for the Con&s;table, and one for the Pre&s;ident
of the Council; with a world of Huts for the re&s;t. There
are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall Cabins &s;et up, which are not covered
and clo&s;ed but upon one &s;ide, which they turn as the Wind
blows; and the&s;e are the places where they dre&s;s their Vi|ctuals:
For at that time the King allows two meals a
day to all his Attendants.</P>
<P>Through this Plain runs the River of&mdash;which
is very broad in that place. Upon this River are &s;everal
Galleys richly gilded and painted, but e&s;pecially the Ad|miral,
which exceeds all the re&s;t in Maginificence. The
Prow, the Poop, the Ropes, the Oars, but onely that part
which goes into the water, glitter all with Gold; the Ben|ches
very ingeniou&s;ly painte the Rowers well clad. For
there the Rowers are all Souldiers and Freemen, contrary
to the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Souldiers in their youth are
taught to handle their Oars, and have &s;omewhat better Pay
than the Land-Souldiers. The Galleys are not &s;o big as
<PB N="45" REF="40">
ours, but they are longer, and cut the water better. While
the King &s;tays in this place, he diverts him&s;elf with &s;eeing
the&s;e Galleys row one again&s;t another. In the Evening the
Rowers come a&s;hoar with their Captains to ki&s;s the King's
Hand, and they that have behav'd them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;toutly
and nimbly, carry off the Marks of his Bounty. The &s;even
days being pa&s;t, the King calls before him all the Souldiers
of the Galleys with their Officers, and gives them two
moneths Wages extraordinary, as he does to his Land-Souldiers.
'Tis a wonderful thing to behold the va&s;t num|ber
of Fireworks which they throw about, as well upon the
Land as upon the Water. For my Brother, who has been
pre&s;ent at all the&s;e Shews, has told me, that for the&s;e &s;even
days together you would think the Air and Water all on fire.
Being at <HI>Bantam</HI> I once &s;aw one of the&s;e artificial Firework-Shews
which the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> that were there plaid off before
the King, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was quite another thing from
what we make in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;even days being pa&s;t, the King returns to the City in
the &s;ame order, and with the &s;ame pomp, as he went
forth; and being come to his Palace, he goes directly to
the Apartment of his Prince&s;&s;es, where none but his Eu|nuchs
accompany him, where he &s;tays all the re&s;t of the
moneth. Every Evening he diverts him&s;elf with new Fire-works,
which are plaid off before the Womens Lodgings;
where al&s;o the Eunuchs, together with the Comedians and
Mummers, contribute to diverti&s;e the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of Tunquin, and

<P>WHen the King of <HI>Tunquin</HI> dies, he is pre&s;ently
Embalm'd and laid in a Bed of State, where
for &s;ixty five days the People have liberty to
come and &s;ee him. All that time he is &s;erv'd as he was
when he was alive; and when the Meat is taken from be|fore
the Body, one half is given to the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and the other
half to the Poor. So &s;oon as the King hath breath'd his
la&s;t ga&s;p, the Con&s;table gives notice thereof to the Go|vernours
of Provinces, and orders them how long they &s;hall
Mourn.</P>
<P>All the Military <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Judges wear Mourning
generally three years, the King's Hou&s;hold nine moneths,
the Nobility &s;ix, and the meaner &s;ort three moneths. Du|ring
the&s;e three years there is a Ce&s;&s;ation from all Diver|ti&s;ements,
except tho&s;e that attend the Ceremony of the
King's Advance or Elevation to the Throne. All the Vi|ands
which are &s;erv'd up to the King are verni&s;h'd with
Black. The King cuts his Hair, and covers his Head with
a Bonnet of Straw, as do likewi&s;e all the Princes and Coun|&s;ellors
of State; neither do they leave off that Habit till the
King's Body be in the Galley which is to carry him to his
Enterment. Three Bells which hang in one of the Tow|ers
of the Palace, never leave tolling from the King's ex|piring
till the Corps be put into the Galley. The third day
after his Decea&s;e all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> repair to Court, to te&s;ti|fie
their &s;orrow which they have for the Death of the de|cea&s;ed
King, and ten days after that the People are allow|ed
to &s;ee the Body lie in State, till it be put into the
Galley.</P>
<P>During the &s;ixty five days that the Body is thus expos'd,
the Con&s;table is bu&s;ie in preparing for the Funeral Pomp.
From the Palace to the place where the Galleys wait for
the Body, it is about two days Journey, and all the way</P>

Elephants, with Wooden Turrets on their Backs, and in every one of
the&s;e are Six Men, &s;ome being armed with Mu&s;quets, others with
Fire Lances. The four la&s;t Elephants do &s;everally carry a kind of
Cage; &s;ome of which are on all &s;ides &s;hut up with Gla&s;s Windows,
the other with a &s;ort of Grates; the fir&s;t being of a Square, the other
having &s;ix &s;ides and facing.</P>
<P>3. Then rides the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, attended with two Pages
on Hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>4. Twelve Hor&s;es are led by the Bridle two and two, by as
many Captains of the Guard. The Harne&s;s of the fir&s;t Six Hor&s;es

are of pure Gold, the Saddles are embroydered likewi&s;e with Gold:
But the Six other Hor&s;es Harne&s;s is all cover'd over with Gold
Plates.</P>
<P>5. The Chariot which bears the <HI>Mau&s;olee,</HI> wherein is the

a Straw Cap on his Head. If he hath any Brothers, they attend
on him in the like Attire; and they are &s;urrounded with Mu&s;icians
and Players on the <HI>Hoboys,</HI> and other In&s;truments.</P>
<P>7. There proceeds afterwards Six Prince&s;&s;es in White Satten,

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Order ob&s;erved at
the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of Tunquin,
&s;etting out from the City of Bodlego.</HEAD>
<P>The King's Body is put into a Galley, which is drawn up the Ri|ver.
This River is increa&s;ed by &s;everal Brooks that come down
from the Mountains, and it runs through barren and De&s;art Coun|tries.
In &s;ome of the&s;e places they are wont to bury the Corps very
privately; for &s;ix onely of the chief Eunuchs of the Court are to know
where the King hath been buried. An Oath is tendered to them ne|ver
to reveal the place. And this is done perhaps on &s;ome Religious
Motive, and likewi&s;e through Fear, that the Trea&s;ures which are
buried by him &s;hould be digged up. The&s;e Riches are ordinarily &s;ome
Ma&s;&s;y Bars of Gold and Silver, as likewi&s;e &s;ome Pieces of Cloth of
Gold and Silver, and &s;uch kinds of other rich Furnitures, which he is
to make u&s;e of (as they &s;ay) when he hath need of them in the other
World. Many Lords and Ladies of the Court will needs be buried
Alive with him, for to &s;erve him in the places where he is to go. I

&s;pread with Violet-colour'd Calicut, which is the King's
Colour. But in regard the King and all the Court march
afoot both going and coming, they make it &s;eventeen days
Journey. At every quarter of a Leagues end are &s;et up
Huts, where is ready prepar'd Water to drink, and Fire to
light their Tobacco. After the Pomp is over, and that the
King is returned home, the Cloth is taken up and given to
the <HI>Bonzes.</HI></P>
<P>As to the order of their March it is thus:</P>
<P>The two men that go formo&s;t of all, are the two U&s;hers
of the Door of the King's Chamber, who go repeating
aloud the Name of the decea&s;ed King, carrying each of
them a Mace of Arms, the bole whereof is full of artificial
Fireworks. The twelve that follow, are the twelve chief
Officers of the Galley, which draw the Tomb whereon the
King's Name is written. Then follows the grand Squire on
Hor&s;eback, attended by two others. Next appear twelve
led Hor&s;es, which are led two by two, &s;ix of which have
their Bridles enrich'd with thin Plates of Gold, and their
Saddles embroydered. The other &s;ix with Bridles of Gold,
and Hou&s;&s;es embroidered, and fring'd about with a Gold and
Silver Fringe; every Hor&s;e being led by two men. Next
to them follow twelve Elephants, four which carry each of
them a man carrying a Standard; four others which carry
each of them a Tower with &s;ix men apiece, &s;ome with Mu&s;|quets,
others with Fire Lances; the four la&s;t carry each of
them a kind of a Cage, of which one is made with Gla&s;s
Windows before and upon each &s;ide; the other like a kind
of a Lattice, and the other with four kinds of Ruffs: and
the&s;e are the King's Elephants which he rode upon when he
went to the Wars. Behind them follow eight Hor&s;es, eve|ry
one of them led by a Captain of the Guard, who draw
the Her&s;e. The new King, and his Brothers if he have
any, or the Princes of the Bloud, follow the Her&s;e, clad in
Robes of White Satten, which is their Mourning Colour.
La&s;tly follow two Chariots, each one drawn by eight Hor|&s;es,
and carrying two Coffers, wherein are the Panes of
Gold, Bars of Silver, rich Ti&s;&s;ues and Habits, which are to
be buried with the Body of the decea&s;ed King.</P>

<HEAD>The Funerals of the Tunquine&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>AS fer the ordinary Funerals of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> they are
more or le&s;s pompous, according to the Quality of
the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>At their Enterments they u&s;e great &s;tore of artificial Fire|works,
which are the Companions as well of their Sorrow
as their Joy. They &s;et upon the Tomb of the decea&s;ed
good &s;tore of Victuals and Comfitures, out of a belief that
the dead are the better for them. For their Prie&s;ts keep
them in that blind Error for their own advantage, and &s;o
well order their bu&s;ine&s;s, that there is nothing left by morn|ing.
The &s;ame thing is practi&s;ed by the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> at <HI>Bata|via,</HI>
where they have a place without the Town to bury
their dead, which puts me in mind of this Story: Every
evening the Guard is relieved as well in the City as in the
Fortre&s;s. At the &s;ame time al&s;o they put forth eight Souldi|ers
and a Corporal at each Gate of the City, who go the
Rounds about the Walls of the City, and as far as within Ca|non-&s;hot
of the Walls, being fearful of being &s;urpri&s;ed by
the King of <HI>Mataran,</HI> or <HI>Bontam,</HI> their Capital Enemies.
Now becau&s;e the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> burying place lay in the Walk of
the&s;e Souldiers, when they &s;aw the Provant upon one of the
Tombs, took it away to their Guard, and there fea&s;ted them|&s;elves.
The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Prie&s;ts, that u&s;ually came about mid|night
to take away the Victuals, finding them&s;elves &s;everal
times bereaved of their Expectations, and &s;u&s;pecting the
Souldiers belonging to the <HI>Holland</HI> Garri&s;on, fir&s;t complain|ed
to the General and Council; but that not taking effect,
they re&s;olved to poi&s;on both the Meat and the Drink, to
prevent the like Fraud for the future. This took &s;o good
effect, that afterwards many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Souldiers being
poi&s;oned, deterr'd the re&s;t from any more &s;uch Licori&s;h At|tempts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion and Superstition of the
Tunquine&s;es</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> as to matters of Religion are divided
into three Sects: The fir&s;t takes its original from
an ancient Philo&s;opher called <HI>Confutius,</HI> who&s;e Me|mory
is very famous over all <HI>China,</HI> and the neighbouring
Countries. Their Doctrine a&s;&s;erts that Man is compos'd
of two parts, the one fine and &s;ubtil, the other material and
gro&s;s; and that when Man dies, the &s;ubtiler part goes into
the Air, and the gro&s;&s;er part &s;tays in the Earth. This Sect
maintains the u&s;e of Sacrifices, and adores the &s;even Planets.
But among all their Gods and Idols they have four in parti|cular
veneration; the Names of the&s;e Gods are <HI>Rauma, Be|tolo,
Ramonu,</HI> and <HI>Brama.</HI> They have a Godde&s;s al&s;o, who&s;e
Name is <HI>Satisbana,</HI> which is &s;he whom the Women adore;
but for the King and the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> e&s;pecially the more &s;tu|dious
&s;ort, they adore the Heavens. The &s;econd Sect had
for its Founder a certain Hermite called <HI>Chacabout,</HI> and is
followed by the mo&s;t part of the meaner people. He has
taught them the Tran&s;migration of Souls, and has enjoyn'd
his Followers to ob&s;erve 10 Commandments.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, That they &s;hall not kill. 2. That they &s;hall
not &s;teal. 3. That they &s;hall not defile their Bodies-
4. That they &s;hall not lye. 5. That they &s;hall not be un|faithful
in their words. 6. That they &s;hall re&s;train their in|ordinate
De&s;ires. 7. That they &s;hall do injury to no man.
8. That they &s;hall not be great Talkers. 9. That they &s;hall
not give way to their Anger. 10. That they &s;hall labour
to their utmo&s;t to get Knowledge.</P>
<P>As for them that de&s;ign to live a Religious Life, they mu&s;t
renounce the Delights of this Life, be charitable to the poor,
overcome their Pa&s;&s;ions, and give them&s;elves up to Medita|tion.
He taught moreover, that after this Life there were
ten di&s;tinct places of Joy and Torment: and that the Con|temners
of this Law &s;hould feel Torments proportionable
<PB N="50" REF="47">
to their Offences, without any end of their Torments. That
they that endeavour'd to fulfill his Law, and had fail'd in
any point, they &s;hould wander in divers Bodies for 3000
years before they entered into happine&s;s. But that they
who had perfectly obeyed his Law, &s;hould be rewarded
without &s;uffering any change of Body. And that he him&s;elf
had been born ten times, before he enjoyed the Bli&s;s which
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not having in his fir&s;t Youth been illuminated
with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained. This
<HI>Chacabout</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Impo&s;tors that ever was in
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> having &s;pread his Opinions over all the Kingdom of
<HI>Siam,</HI> over a great part of the Provinces of <HI>Japon,</HI> and from
thence into <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where he died.</P>
<P>The third Sect is that of <HI>Lanthu,</HI> to who&s;e Fables the <HI>Ja|ponne&s;es</HI>
and <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> give great credence, but the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI>
more. He was a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> by Nation, and one of the great|e&s;t
Magicians in the Ea&s;t. He made a great many Di&s;ciples,
who to authorize this black Impo&s;tor, and the more to im|po&s;e
upon the people, made them believe that the Birth of
<HI>Lanthu</HI> was miraculous, and that his Mother carried him in
her Womb, without lo&s;ing her Virginity, &s;eventy years.
He taught much of <HI>Chacabout</HI>'s Doctrine; but that which
won the Hearts of the people was, that he &s;till exhorted the
Grandees to build Ho&s;pitals in all Cities where there had
been none before. In&s;omuch that &s;everal of the Nobility
betook them&s;elves to tho&s;e places to look after the Sick, as
did al&s;o a great number of the <HI>Bonzes</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on.
While my Brother was there, the <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> a great Enemy to
the&s;e Vagabonds, &s;ent for a great number of <HI>Bonzes</HI> and
<HI>Says,</HI> or idle Fellows, and picking out the &s;tronge&s;t and
be&s;t proportion'd, &s;ent them away to the Frontiers for Soul|diers.</P>
<P>'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> to adore three things
in their Hou&s;es: The fir&s;t is the Hearth of their Chimney
made of three Stones The &s;econd is an Idol which they
call <HI>Tien&s;a,</HI> which is the Patrone&s;s of Handicrafts, as Sculp|ture,
Painting, Gold&s;mith's work, &amp;c. So that when they
put forth a Child to learn any of tho&s;e Trades, before they
let him work they &s;et up an Altar, and &s;acrifice to this Idol,
to the end he may infu&s;e into the Lad wit and aptne&s;s to
learn. The third is the Idol <HI>Buabin,</HI> which they implore
<PB N="51" REF="47">
when they de&s;ign to build an Hou&s;e. For then they erect
an Altar, and &s;end for the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> to &s;acrifice to
this Idol. To this purpo&s;e they make great preparation of
all &s;orts of Viands, and then pre&s;ent him with &s;everal gilt
Papers, wherein are written &s;everal Magic words, endea|vouring
by that means that he may not &s;uffer any misfortune
to befall the Hou&s;e they are going to build.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> that adore the Heaven, others
the Moon, and others the Stars. There are al&s;o &s;ome that
adore five parts of the Earth, making a fifth part in the
middle of that which is known to us, and to them al&s;o, but
confu&s;edly. When they wor&s;hip them, they have for each
of the parts a particular Colour. When they adore the
Northern part, they clothe them&s;elves in black; and the
Di&s;hes and Table whereon they lay their Sacrifices are like|wi&s;e
black. When they wor&s;hip the South their Habit is
red; when the Ea&s;t, green; when the We&s;t, white; and
when they adore the middle of the World, they wear
Yellow.</P>
<P>They offer Offerings likewi&s;e to Trees, Elephants, Hor&s;es,
Cows, and almo&s;t to all other &s;orts of Animals. They that &s;tu|dy
the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Characters are accu&s;tomed every fifth moneth
of the year, to &s;acrifice for the Souls of the dead who were
never buried. They believe that by &s;o doing their Under|&s;tandings
&s;hall be more enlightned for the apprehending of
all things.</P>
<P>Every year, at the beginning of the year, they have a
great Solemnity, to honour after their death tho&s;e who in
their life-time have done any noble action, and were re|nowned
for their Valour, reckoning in that number tho&s;e
that have been &s;o hardy as to rebel again&s;t their Princes, as
being men of Courage. Three days before this great So|lemnity,
which is perform'd in a large Field, they &s;et up
&s;everal Altars, &s;ome for the Sacrifices, others for the Names
of the Illu&s;trious Men whom they de&s;ign to honour. The Eve
before above 40000 Souldiers &s;pend the night in this Plain,
where all the Princes and <HI>Mandarins</HI> are ordered to meet
with their Elephants and led Hor&s;es, and the King him&s;elf
goes thither in per&s;on. After they have fini&s;hed all their
Sacrifices, and burnt good &s;tore of Incen&s;e to the Honour of
the dead, the King and all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make three pro|found
<PB N="52" REF="48">
Reverences where the Altars are; then the King
&s;hoots with his Bow and Arrows five times again&s;t the Al|tars,
where lie the Names of tho&s;e that were &s;o ra&s;h as to
rebel again&s;t their Sovereigns. After that the great Guns
go off, and the Souldiers give three Volleys of &s;mall Shot,
to put all the Souls to flight. Then they burn all the Al|tars,
and a great number of gilt Papers, which were made
u&s;e of at the Sacrifices; concluding all with a mo&s;t hideous
&s;hout of all the Souldiery. Which done, the <HI>Bonzes, Says,</HI>
and &s;uch like people, come and devour the Meat that was
made u&s;e of for the Sacrifices.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and fifteenth days of the Moneth 'tis a wonder|ful
thing to hear the Chiming Din of their great Bells. For
tho&s;e are the more e&s;pecial Holydays &s;et apart for the Wor|&s;hip
of their Gods, and all the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> give them
more than ordinary Wor&s;hip upon tho&s;e days, redoubling
their Prayers, and repeating upon tho&s;e days every one of
them a &s;trange kind of Charm &s;ix times over. At the&s;e
times &s;everal people bring Meat and Drink to the Sepul|chres
of their Kindred, to &s;acrifice for the good of their Souls
to eat. The <HI>Bonzes</HI> fail not to be there, and when the
others have paid their Devoirs the <HI>Bonzes</HI> fall to, and what
they cannot eat they give to the poor. But for all the au|&s;tere
Lives of the&s;e <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says,</HI> neither the King nor
the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make any account of them, &s;o that they are in
credit onely with the common people.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where the great Cities have
&s;everal <HI>Pagods,</HI> there is hardly a Town or Village that has
not one, and for every <HI>Pagod</HI> at lea&s;t two <HI>Bonzes</HI> and two
<HI>Says.</HI> But there are &s;ome <HI>Pagods</HI> that maintain forty <HI>Bonzes</HI>
and as many <HI>Says,</HI> who live in common under a Superiour,
they keep to the Doctrine of <HI>Chacabout,</HI> and a Goat is the Idol
which they adore. They wear about their Necks a kind of
Necklace, con&s;i&s;ting of 100 Beads, very big and made of
Wood. In their Hands they carry a Staff, which is headed
with a Bird of varni&s;h'd Wood. They beg for their living,
and are not like the <HI>Bonzes</HI> in other Kingdoms, who beg
Alms as it were their due; the&s;e on the contrary u&s;e all the
mode&s;ty and humility that may be, never taking more than
is needful for them: and if they have any thing to &s;pare,
they give it to the poor Widows or Orphans that cannot get

they leave their Mona&s;tery. They a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Funerals
of great men, where they &s;ay a kind of Orizon, &s;ounding
their Trumpets and Cornets, while the Bells in their <HI>Pagods</HI>
go at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> al&s;o have a great veneration for two
Magicians, and one Magiciane&s;s. The fir&s;t of their Magi|cians,
whom they call <HI>Tay-bou,</HI> makes them believe that he
knows the Events of things to come; &s;o that when they
have any occa&s;ion to marry their Children, build a Hou&s;e,
buy Land, or undertake any bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence, they
con&s;ult this Oracle to know what &s;hall happen to them.
The Magician courteou&s;ly receives them, and with a coun|terfeit
mode&s;ty demands of them (for Example) the Age of
the per&s;on concerned. Then taking into his hands a great
Book about three fingers thick, wherein are the Figures of
Men, half Men, and &s;everal &s;orts of Land and Water Ani|mals,
of Circles, Triangles, and Squares, he goes to work,
and at the &s;ame time puts into a Goblet three Pieces of Cop|per,
whereon are engraven &s;everal Characters onely up|on
one &s;ide. After he has &s;haken the Pieces in the Cup,
he throws them upon the ground as at Cro&s;s and Pile; if
all the Characters lie undermo&s;t he looks no further in his
Book, but looks upon it as an unfortunate &s;ign; but if one
or two Characters come up, he looks in his Book, and
makes the per&s;on believe what he plea&s;es. But if all the
Characters happen to turn uppermo&s;t, then the Magician
cries out, that the Party is the mo&s;t fortunate in the world.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Magician is called <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy,</HI> to whom
they have recour&s;e in all their Sickne&s;&s;es. When any &s;ick
per&s;on comes to him, he takes a Book full of Figures like
the former; onely the Form of the Book is different, for
this is not above an inch thick, and about four fingers long,
with eight Panes full of Cyphers. If after &s;everal Api&s;h
tricks which he acts before the &s;ick per&s;on to amu&s;e him, he
affirms that the Di&s;temper comes from the Devil, he him|&s;elf,
together with the &s;ick party and they that brought him,
do Homage to the evil &s;pirit: this Homage con&s;i&s;ts of &s;e|veral
Sacrifices, and the Friends of the &s;ick party pre&s;ent to
the Devil, or rather to the Magician, a Table furni&s;h'd with
Rice and other Viands. But if after all the&s;e Offerings the
<PB N="54" REF="51">
&s;ick party do not recover his health, all the Friends and
Kindred of the &s;ick party, with as many Souldiers as they
can get, &s;urround the &s;ick per&s;ons Hou&s;e, and &s;hoot off their
Mu&s;quets three times, to drive away the Devil. Some|times
the Magician makes the &s;ick party and his Friends be|lieve,
that the God of the Waters is the cau&s;e of the Di&s;tem|per,
e&s;pecially if the &s;ick per&s;on belongs to the Water, as
being a Mariner, Boatman, or Fi&s;herman. And to the end
he may be cur'd, and that the appeas'd God may return to
his watry Habitation, he orders that all the way from the
&s;ick parties Hou&s;e to the next River may be &s;pread with all
the Pieces of Stuff which all the Kindred have, and that
they &s;et up Huts at &s;uch and &s;uch di&s;tances, and keep in eve|ry
one a &s;everal Table furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Viands for 3
days. And all this to oblige the Deity to retire, and to en|tertain
him till he gets home. But the better to know the
ri&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy</HI> makes them believe,
that they mu&s;t go and con&s;ult <HI>Thay-Bou,</HI> who is the chief
Magician, and if he an&s;wer that the Souls of the dead have
cau&s;ed the Di&s;temper, the Magician imploys all his tricks
and devices to draw to him tho&s;e mi&s;chievous Souls; and
when he has got into his Clutches, as he pretends, the Soul
that is the Author of the Di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;huts him up in a Bottle
full of Water till the party be cured; and then breaking the
Bottle he &s;ets the Soul at liberty to go about his bu&s;ine&s;s.
When the party recovers, he makes him and his Friends be|lieve,
that if the Bottle had not been well &s;topp'd to keep in
the Soul, their Kin&s;man would have died infallibly.</P>
<P>The Magiciane&s;s, which the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> al&s;o con&s;ult, is
called <HI>Bacoti,</HI> and &s;he keeps a great Corre&s;pondence with
the Devil, to whom, if &s;he has a Daughter, &s;he offers her as
&s;oon as &s;he is born, the more to oblige him. If any Mo|ther
bewail the death of her Child, and be de&s;irous to know
in what condition the Soul of the Child is in, in the other
world, &s;he goes to <HI>Bacoti,</HI> who to &s;atisfie the Mother pre|&s;ently
falls a beating her Drum, to &s;ummon the Soul to come
to her, who pre&s;ently appears, as &s;he pretends, and tells her
its Condition whether good or bad. But mo&s;t commonly
&s;he makes the &s;illy Mothers believe that the Soul is happy,
and bids them be of good cheer.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="51">
The Super&s;titions of the&s;e people are very numerous, but
the mo&s;t remarkable are the&s;e:</P>
<P>The &s;tudious &s;ort of people are very diligent to learn, how
by looking in a Mirrour to foretell things to come.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that pre&s;ent <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> to the dead, and
&s;prinkle their A&s;hes with it; but this onely upon the A&s;hes
of their Ance&s;tors, from whom at the &s;ame time they beg
for Health; Honour, and Riches.</P>
<P>Others there are, that upon the fir&s;t day of their year take
a piece of Chalk, and make &s;everal Figures round, &s;quare,
and triangular, upon the Thre&s;hold and Steps of their
Doors. They &s;ay tho&s;e Figures fright away the evil &s;pirits.
Some there are that make great Ob&s;ervations upon the Feet
of their Hens, and draw &s;trange Conclu&s;ions of bad or ill
fortune from thence. Others travelling into the Countrey,
if they &s;neeze but once by the way, return to the place from
whence they parted in the morning, &s;aying, That had they
gone on, &s;ome mi&s;chief would have certainly befallen them:
but if they &s;neeze twice, they pur&s;ue their Journey, never fear|ing
any danger for that day.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that going out of their
Hou&s;es, if they meet a Woman, they return home again for
two or three hours; but if they meet a Man, 'tis a good
<HI>Omen.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Fruit which they gather at the beginning of the
year, is that which the <HI>Araguer</HI> bears, &s;poken of in the third
Chapter. And this is the fir&s;t which they eat with great
Ceremony, during the fir&s;t Quarter of their &s;econd Moneth.
To which purpo&s;e they are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Devil, that
they poy&s;on one of the&s;e Fruits, and give it to a Child to eat,
believing that by taking away the life of the poor innocent
Child, they &s;hall thrive the better all the year after.</P>
<P>When the Moon is eclip&s;ed, they &s;ay there is a certain
Dragon that a&s;&s;ails her, and endeavours with all his might
to overcome her, with an intention to devour her. Then
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Moon, and to put the Dragon to flight, they
di&s;charge their Mu&s;quets, ring their Bells, beat up their
Drums, and make a hideous noi&s;e till the Eclip&s;e be over:
and then they believe that they have re&s;cued the Moon, for
which they make as great a rejoycing, as if they had ob|tain'd
&s;ome eminent Victory over their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="52">
They are al&s;o very &s;uper&s;titious in reference to the hours
of the day. They divide the natural day into twelve hours,
and to every one they give the name of &s;ome Bea&s;t, as of a
Tiger, a Lion, a Bear, a Hor&s;e, a Dragon, an Ape, &amp;c. The
Moneths al&s;o and Days have their particular Names: and
when a Child is born, pre&s;ently the Father and Kindred go
to &s;ee the name of the Bea&s;t by which the Hour was call'd
wherein the Child was born; believing that Animal will
prove fatal to it. At the time that my Brother was at the
Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the King then reigning being born in the
hour of the Hor&s;e, would never give Audience, nor ever &s;tir
out of his Palace at that hour, for fear &s;ome mi&s;chief &s;hould
befall him at that time. That Prince was &s;o &s;uper&s;titious,
that one of his Children dying in the fifth moneth, which
bears the name of the Hor&s;e, he would never permit him to
be enterr'd, but caus'd him to be burnt, and &s;catter'd his a&s;hes
in the Air.</P>
<P>This is that which I could gather of mo&s;t remarkable and
mo&s;t con&s;iderable matters concerning the State of the King|dom
of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> either out of the Manu&s;cripts which my

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Hollanders po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it,
and how it was taken from them by the
Chine&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>_THE I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> is about Eighty
Leagues in compa&s;s; &s;o that the <HI>Holland|ers</HI>
were never in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole
I&s;land, but were onely Ma&s;ters of four
Fortre&s;&s;es, and two and fifty Villages,
wherein they could number about four|teen
or fifteen thou&s;and Inhabitants. As
for that part which is under the <HI>Indians,</HI> the be&s;t di&s;covery
that we can give, is onely &s;uch as was made by a young
<HI>Hollander</HI> upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="53">
There was in the chief Fort belonging to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a
young man, imployed there as an under-Factor, who being
wild and extravagant, was put out of his place and made a
Souldier. He not able to undergo that mi&s;erable cour&s;e of
life, re&s;olved with him&s;elf rather to die, than live in that
mean condition. Thereupon having at &s;everal opportuni|ties
made a &s;hift to make up a little Pack of what he thought
was mo&s;t fit for the Mountainiers of the I&s;land, he watch'd
his time and &s;tole out of the Fort, and took his way directly
toward the Mountains. With the&s;e Highlanders he liv'd
four years, in which time having learnt the Trade and Lan|guage
of the Countrey, he ventur'd to return to the <HI>Holland|ers</HI>
again, who received him kindly, as being willing to
under&s;tand the Government of the People, and by what
means they might traffick with them. Whereupon the young
man made them this Relation.</P>
<P>As for the Government of the People he &s;aid, that over
every &s;ix Villages there was an Over&s;eer with four Coun&s;el|lors,
who admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice, and puni&s;h the &s;malle&s;t Theft
with Death. The Men are crucified; the Women are laid
along upon a thick Beam of Wood, and then with a Scimi|tar
their Bodies are divided into three parts. The Men are
&s;o puni&s;h'd for Theft or Murder, and the Women for Theft
or Adultery. If it be a Pety Larceny, not above the value
of a Shilling, they give them an hundred La&s;hes with a
Whip, and burn them in the Cheek. They that believe
them&s;elves to be unju&s;tly dealt with, whether in Civil or
Criminal Cau&s;es, enter their Appeal to go to the North Ea&s;t
part of the I&s;land, in which divi&s;ion of the I&s;land there &s;tands
a City by the Sea-&s;ide, where he that commands all the
Highlanders re&s;ides. At the end of our Moneth of <HI>March</HI>
&s;everal of the&s;e Highlanders re&s;ort to this City, e&s;pecially
the Merchants, who carry along with them all their whole
Stock that they had hoarded together the year before in
Horns of Oxen, Harts, Bufulo's, and Raw Hides; and then
return again at the end of <HI>April,</HI> bringing back in return of
their Commodities <HI>Japon</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Stuffs, Clothes, and
Linen of the &s;ame Countrey, and Gold and Silver <HI>Japone&s;e</HI>
Money, of various Coyns and Value. He told them al&s;o,
that he believed that in the Mountains near the Sea, there
are certain Mines of Gold and Silver, or &s;ome River where
<PB N="59" REF="53">
they find it in Powder, and that the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> fetch it in their
Ve&s;&s;els. He did all he could to di&s;cover the truth, but after
he had travelled two or three days Journey, the People
would let him go no further. For at the end of every three
or four hours travel there are Guards &s;et, who examine all
Travellers whither they go; neither will they let their own
Countrymen pa&s;s, but &s;uch as go about their Law or to trade.
Moreover he told them, that if they would give him Goods
to trade withall, as Amber, Coral, Looking Gla&s;&s;es; but
chiefly &s;ome Skins of the Sea Fi&s;h, which is rougher than
Seal-skin, he would endeavour to get to the very City it &s;elf
where the Ships ride. The&s;e Skins are greatly e&s;teemed by
the Natives to adorn the Scabbards of their
Cutla&s;&s;es and Swords. For u&s;ually upon the
back of this Fi&s;h you &s;hall find nine little
Stones, which make a kind of a Ro&s;e, eight
in a Circle and one in the middle, as you
&s;ee the&s;e nine di&s;po&s;ed in their exact order.
When the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> traded onely to <HI>Japon,</HI>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
it is incredible how dear they &s;old the&s;e Skins. For if Na|ture
had well &s;et the&s;e Stones at an equal di&s;tance, and even
in bigne&s;s, one of the&s;e Skins would yield above ten thou|&s;and
<HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> and more. This Fi&s;h is caught in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Gulph, where I have &s;een of them, but I &s;aw but very few
&s;o perfect as that which I have de&s;crib'd, which would in
tho&s;e Countries yield ten thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>But to return to the Story; the Governour gave the
young man what he de&s;ired, and &s;ent him going: but the
<HI>Chine&s;es</HI> &s;oon after expelling the <HI>Hollanders</HI> out of the I&s;land,
it was never known what became of the young man.</P>
<P>It may be wondered why <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> was taken &s;o &s;oon:
but here were two Rea&s;ons, fir&s;t the faint-heartedne&s;s of the
Governour, and &s;econdly his breach of word to a <HI>French</HI>
Souldier of <HI>Rouen,</HI> call'd <HI>Abraham du Puys;</HI> for he having
&s;erved out his time of &s;even years, de&s;ir'd leave to be gone,
but the Governour, after he had promis'd him fair at fir&s;t, at
length ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him. Soon after the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> came
to be&s;iege the place. The Souldier thus di&s;appointed, and
&s;eeing him&s;elf coop'd up who might have been free, had the
Governour &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;tudied a fatal revenge upon all his
Countrymen; for being by this means grown de&s;perate,
<PB N="60" REF="54">
watch'd his opportunity, and flinging him&s;elf from the Fort
into the Sea, &s;wam directly to the Enemy. The Gover|nour
offered 200 Pieces of Eight to any per&s;on that would
venture after him, and bring him back dead or alive. A
Serjeant accepted his offer, but it was to get loo&s;e as the
other had done; and &s;o they got both &s;afe into the Enemies
Quarters. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> pre&s;ently carried them to the Ge|neral
<HI>Coxima;</HI> and he being a per&s;on of Valour and Di&s;cre|tion,
made very much of them, whereupon they readily
and willingly inform'd him of the &s;trength and condition of
the Fortre&s;s. They al&s;o advi&s;ed him to remove his Batte|ries
to the weake&s;t part of the Town, whereas he was then
a&s;&s;ailing it where it was mo&s;t &s;trongly fortified: which if
he would do, they a&s;&s;ur'd him he &s;hould be &s;oon Ma&s;ter of
the Fort. The General was thinking a little before they
came to have rai&s;ed his Siege, but upon their encouragement
he fell on again according to their direction; and as he was
preparing for a general A&s;&s;ault, the <HI>Holland</HI> Commander,
fearful of lo&s;ing his Life and his E&s;tate, beat a Parley, and
&s;urrender'd the place upon Articles.</P>
<P>During the Siege the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a Salley, but were
beaten in again, and fourteen of their men were taken Pri|&s;oners.
The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> finding tho&s;e fourteen men in their
power, and remembering how cruel the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had been
to their Nation when they took any of them at Sea, brought
the fourteen men all together, put out one eye of each, cut
off their No&s;es, Ears, and one hand, and &s;o &s;ent them back
to the Fort, with order to tell the Commander, that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had taught them that kind of Mercy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Maurice I&s;land, where they cut
Ebony.</HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land call'd <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land lies almo&s;t in 84
degrees of Longitude, and 21 degrees of Southern
Latitude, being but 2 degrees and 30 minutes from
the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> right over again&s;t the middle of
the great I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which it has upon the We&s;t,
from whence it lies 140 Leagues, and is in compa&s;s about
60 Leagues. It bears great quantities of Ebony: and here
it was that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did formerly &s;end their Slaves,
their bani&s;h'd and condemn'd Per&s;ons, to cut that &s;ort of
Wood, which is Labour much more &s;evere and cruel than
that of Rowing in the Galleys. The whole I&s;land is &s;ubject
to tho&s;e violent and outrageous Tempe&s;ts call'd <HI>Ouragans,</HI>
which nothing can with&s;tand, &s;o that the People are forc'd to
dig them&s;elves Holes in the ground, not being able to keep
their Huts &s;tanding. Neither had the poor Creatures any
other Food than a little boil'd Rice, and about a Farthings
worth of Salt-fi&s;h among four for a whole day. Since that
the Price of Ebony being brought very low, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
for&s;aken the I&s;land, the Profit not bearing the &s;orry Expen|ces
which tho&s;e poor Creatures put them to.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as this Tree is cut down it mu&s;t be &s;awed into
Planks, and then buried &s;even or eight foot deep in the
Earth, which ought to be &s;omewhat moi&s;t. There tho&s;e
Planks mu&s;t lie two years, and &s;ometimes three, if the Wood
be very thick. After that the Wood is fit to be wrought up|on,
neither will it &s;plinter or &s;plit, and will the &s;ooner ad|mit
of a glittering Poli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land puts me in mind of a Story, that the
Sieur <HI>Loocker</HI> told me, concerning what befell him in his
Voyage from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Batavia</HI> in the Year 1643. <HI>Cha
Abbas</HI> the &s;econd of that Name, King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> having a
great de&s;ire to learn to paint, &s;ignified to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at
<HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> that he de&s;ired them to &s;end into <HI>Holland</HI> for &s;ome
<PB N="62" REF="55">
per&s;on who was excellent both in De&s;igning and Painting.
Thereupon the Chief of the Factory wrote into <HI>Holland,</HI> and
upon his Letters the Company &s;ent away <HI>Loocker,</HI> to oblige
the King; and to do him the greater honour, gave him the
charge of Merchant of the Ve&s;&s;el, who is equal with the
Captain, during the Voyage; to whom the Wind and Sea|&s;on
was very favourable till they came to the <HI>Cape of Good
Hope;</HI> but after they had doubled the Point, the Pilots bare
too much to the North, whereas they &s;hould have &s;teered
directly Ea&s;t; &s;o that when they had made the Height of the
I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> they met with nothing but contrary
Winds. For it is ob&s;ervable, that all the year long there
blows but one Wind toward <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land; &s;o that a Ship
may go thither in eight or nine days, but cannot return in
thirty or forty. For you mu&s;t &s;teer We&s;tward to 30 de|grees,
and from thence Ea&s;tward to 14 or 15 degrees, and
then you light upon <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land. Five days together
the Ship was but rudely handled by the &s;torm; which at
length grew &s;o violent, and the Sea &s;o boi&s;terous, that all
the great Cabin was broken to pieces, the Beak of the Ship
carried away, and the Forema&s;t made un&s;erviceable. Thir|teen
days together they remained in this mi&s;erable conditi|on,
to&s;s'd up and down by the Sea and Wind, all which time
they never &s;aw the Sun, unable to take any height or ob|&s;ervation
where they were. The fourteenth day it cleared
up, and the Sun appeared, and then taking the Height they
ob&s;erved them&s;elves to be not far from the <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land,
which was very true; for the next day by break of day they
found them&s;elves not above two Leagues from the I&s;land;
and they found them&s;elves upon the North &s;ide of the I&s;land,
whereas the <HI>Hollanders</HI> liv'd upon the South. And there|fore
perceiving that if the Wind did not change, it would be
a long time, and that with great difficulty too, before they
could fetch a compa&s;s about the I&s;land to come to the Fort
where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were, they call'd a Council, where it
was re&s;olved that <HI>Loocker</HI> with ten Souldiers &s;hould be put
on &s;hoar, and that he &s;hould endeavour to get to the Fort
by Land, there to make provi&s;ion of Water and Refre&s;h|ments
for the re&s;t of the Company, again&s;t they could come
about. <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land has this advantage, to be furni&s;hed
with excellent Water, and great &s;tore of Goats, Oranges,
<PB N="63" REF="55">
Citrons, and other Fruits: but when the <HI>Ouragans</HI> happen
there is not one to be &s;een upon the Trees, unle&s;s onely up|on
tho&s;e which are &s;helter'd by the Ebony Boughs, which
are thick and &s;trong, and the Trees deeply rooted in the
Earth. <HI>Loocker</HI> thereupon with ten Souldiers was put on
&s;hoar in a Shallop, with Provi&s;ions for &s;ix days. Nor was
the I&s;land in that part above eight or ten Leagues broad,
which they thought to travel in few days: but the Woods
were &s;o thick, that had they not been well provided of Car|penters
Hatchets and Axes, they could never have made
their way. The fir&s;t day they travell'd not above a League,
and the next day not above as much more, being &s;till forced
to hack their way along with great travel and pains. So
that being now weary and &s;pent, they laid them&s;elves upon
the ground to repo&s;e them&s;elves, and get a little &s;leep.
When they wak'd they heard the voices of &s;everal people,
which much rejoyced them, believing them to be the
Slaves and poor Creatures that were cutting Ebony not far
off. Thereupon they fell to work to get as near them as
they could: but the Woods proved &s;o thick, that they de|&s;pair'd
of doing any good. Neverthele&s;s the further they
advanced, the clearer they could hear the voices of the peo|ple,
&s;ome &s;peaking <HI>Dutch,</HI> others <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> Whereupon
<HI>Loocker</HI> caus'd one of the Souldiers in his company that had
a &s;trong voice, to call out in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, to
the people to come and help them. But in&s;tead of that
they all betook them&s;elves to their heels, and fled to the
Commander's Lodge, telling him that there were Devils in
the Woods, and that they had call'd to them in the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Language. The Commander &s;eeing both the Souldiers
and the Slaves in &s;uch a di&s;mal amaze and terror, knew not
at fir&s;t what to think; however he endeavoured to re&s;ettle
their di&s;traction, and to revive a &s;ort of people that were
half dead with fear. The next day he per&s;uaded them to
return to their Work, per&s;uading them to lay a&s;ide their
vain Fears, which proceeded onely from idle Apprehen&s;i|ons:
but they flatly denied him, telling him that they would
rather die, than return to be torn in pieces by the Devil.
However, others that had not been pre&s;ent at the accident,
and therefore gave not &s;o much credit to the report, profer|ed
to &s;ee the utmo&s;t of this bu&s;ine&s;s, provided any one that
<PB N="64" REF="56">
had heard the voice would bring them to the place. Away
upon this went a good number of them together, and co|ming
to the place fell to work. Now becau&s;e <HI>Loocker</HI> and
his Companions having labour'd all the night before, were
fallen a&s;leep; for a good while the Workmen heard no
voice at all, nor &s;o much as any thing &s;tirring, &s;o that they
began to laugh at tho&s;e that had brought them thither, who
&s;till ob&s;tinately maintained the truth of what they had heard.
This Di&s;pute at length began to grow &s;o hot and &s;o loud,
that at length they wak'd <HI>Loocker</HI> and his Fellows, who be|ing
now got nearer to them by means of their la&s;t nights la|bour,
heard di&s;tinctly every word they &s;aid, and notwith|&s;tanding
their di&s;tre&s;s could not chu&s;e but laugh. Soon af|ter
<HI>Loocker</HI> and the Souldiers call'd out again, <HI>Work toward
us,</HI> they cried, <HI>we are Hollanders, come and help us out of the
Wood, and we will put an end to the di&s;pute.</HI> But the Workmen
no &s;ooner heard them, but away they ran for their Lives,
and when they came to the Lodge, they were &s;o har'd, &s;o
&s;car'd, and quite out of breath, that the Governour in vain
endeavour'd to get the lea&s;t tittle of a word from them. At
length being come to them&s;elves, they a&s;&s;ur'd him that it
was too true that the Devils were in the Wood, and that the
more to deceive and wheedle them, to day they had not
onely &s;poken <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but <HI>Dutch</HI> too. This put the Go|vernour
and all into a deep Con&s;ternation, in&s;omuch that
they were all at their Wits end. But the next morning
<HI>Loocker</HI> and his Gang having made their way through, the
Centinel &s;pied them fir&s;t from the Fort, and by the di&s;|charge
of his Mu&s;quet gave notice of the approach of the
Devils. And then it was that the poor affrighted Mortals,
laying a&s;ide their fears, and going forth to meet their own
Shapes, found them to be a company of their Countrymen
in di&s;tre&s;s, whom they then received into their kindne&s;s, to
give an account of their Misfortunes. Three days after the
Ship came into Harbour, though in a mi&s;erable condition.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Grandeur of the General at Batavia, and
what befell his Wife and his Niece.</HEAD>
<P>THe Company to maintain their Authority and
Commerce in the <HI>Indies,</HI> believe it to be to their
advantage, that the General whom they &s;end to <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI>
and who commands in all the places in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> where
the <HI>Dutch</HI> traffic, &s;hould keep up the Port of a Prince.
There is no Cavalry in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o well clad or mounted as
his; the Hor&s;emen all upon <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Steeds. Nor
is his Foot Guard le&s;s &s;umptuous: His Halberdiers wear
their yellow Satten Doublets, Scarlet Breeches lac'd with
Silver Lace, and their Silk Stockins. But this onely for the
General's Guards; for tho&s;e which they &s;end abroad to their
Forts and Garri&s;ons, it is a great pity to &s;ee how poorly they
are attir'd, and how meanly fed. When the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet
arrives at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the Souldiers which they bring are
drawn up in the Parade of the Fortre&s;s by the Major, who
chu&s;es out the hand&s;ome&s;t to remain at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the re&s;t
are &s;ent and di&s;tributed into other places. When the Gene|ral
and his Wife go abroad, they always ride in their Coach
and &s;ix Hor&s;es, with &s;ix Halberdiers attending at each Boot,
and a Troop of Hor&s;e and two Companies of Foot for their
Guard. The Authority of the General is very great, though
he may be &s;ometimes commanded by his Wife: neither is it
&s;afe for them that depend upon them, to do or &s;ay any thing
that may offend them. But for others, who have their Im|ployments
immediately from the Company, they never ob|lige
them&s;elves to be &s;o circum&s;pect. For truth whereof I
will relate the following plea&s;ant Story.</P>
<P>The Wife of General <HI>Mat&s;uker</HI> having one day underta|ken
to play upon a Captain of a Ship call'd the <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and
to laugh at him, for having lo&s;t a Bale of Goods which had
been &s;eized by the Company, in regard no particular per&s;on
is permitted to trade. The Captain nettled at her Di&s;cour&s;e&punc;
re&s;olved to be revenged. Nor was it long before he found
<PB N="66" REF="57">
the means; for being commanded away for <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> in
the Kingdom of <HI>Goleonda,</HI> where being arriv'd, laden, and
ready to &s;et Sail to return to <HI>Batavia,</HI> the chief of the Factory
de&s;ired him to take in four Bales of Goods for the General's
Wife, as belonging to her, and to deliver them privately to
her. This was Nuts to the Captain: &s;o that being return'd
to <HI>Batavia,</HI> he went he went immediately to vi&s;it the Ge|neral,
and deliver him the Letters which concerned the <HI>Car|go.</HI>
Immediately according to cu&s;tom the General invited
him to dinner, at which time it is u&s;ual for the General to
inform him&s;elf of the Condition of the Factory. Among
the re&s;t of the que&s;tions the General asked the Captain whe|ther
he had any Counterband Goods aboard, or any that
were not upon the Company's &s;ole account. To which
the Captain an&s;wered, that all the Goods belonged to the
Company, except four Bales, which the chief Factor at
<HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> had particularly recommended to his care, as be|longing
to Madam General. This being publickly &s;poken
in the pre&s;ence of a great many that were at Table, the Lady
that was not aware of &s;uch a blow, was not a little &s;urpriz'd,
and the General him&s;elf was not a little in wrath, &s;ternly
ask'd her how &s;he dur&s;t undertake to trade without his
knowledge. Pre&s;ently &s;he denied the whole matter, and
averred that the Captain was mi&s;taken, and took her for &s;ome
other per&s;on. But the General &s;ent for the Fi&s;cal, and or|der'd
him to go forthwith with the Captain, and fetch the
four Bales a&s;hoar; which being done, he order'd further
that the Goods &s;hould be carried into the public Hall of the
Town Hou&s;e, with a Writing fix'd upon them, that who|ever
own'd tho&s;e Goods &s;hould come and claim them; but
no body came. So that the Captain had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee
the Lady in a delicate raging pa&s;&s;ion, and the Goods di&s;pos'd
of to the Fi&s;cal, and the Poor of the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The &s;ame General and his Wife having no Children, they
began to con&s;ider to whom they &s;hould leave their E&s;tates.
At length the General bethought him&s;elf of a Niece he had
at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and therefore wrote to the Directors of the
Company to &s;end her to him. This Niece of his cried Pot|herbs
and Onions about the &s;treet to get her living; in which
Calling &s;he was at la&s;t found out, and brought to the Dire|ctors,
who pre&s;ently changed her Habit, and of a Crier of
<PB N="67" REF="57">
Cabbage made her a little Lady; who though &s;he were of
&s;uch a low condition, was not without a good proportion
of natural Beauty.</P>
<P>The Fleet being ready to depart, there was a Cabin built
on purpo&s;e for this Niece, and the Company having pre|&s;ented
her with &s;everal pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue and Silks; recom|mended
her to <HI>C. Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> the Viceadmiral's care. This Cap|tain
had been &s;everal times at the <HI>Indies</HI> before, and was
both rich and a Batchelour: &s;o that when the Ship was out
at Sea, he fail'd not to &s;hew all the re&s;pects imaginable to
this Niece. Now this young Virgin not being accu&s;tomed
to the Sea, upon the lea&s;t gu&s;t of Wind &s;he was half dead;
and all that time the Captain would not &s;tir from her Bed-&s;ide,
for fear any Accident &s;hould befall her. And as he
was thus diligent not to &s;tir from her Bed-&s;ide in fowl, 'tis
verily believ'd he was &s;eldom far from it in fair weather;
and that in&s;tead of &s;itting by her Bed-&s;ide, he &s;ometimes got
fairly into it. But whether he were within or without,
mo&s;t certain it is, that before Madam Niece arrived at <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI>
&s;he found her &s;elf to be with child, though &s;he &s;o
di&s;creetly concealed it, that none in the Ve&s;&s;el percei|ved
it.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el had no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed the Strait that lies to|ward
<HI>Bantam,</HI> but Madam General with a great number of
her Friends in &s;everal little Barques came out to meet Ma|dam
Niece, and were not a little &s;urprized to find her to be
a per&s;on &s;o well clad and hand&s;om withall, without any
appearance of what &s;he had been before.</P>
<P>A Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es, and &s;ix Halberdiers, a Troop
of Hor&s;e, and a Company of Foot, waited upon the &s;hoar
for Madam General. And thus was madam Niece conduct|ed
to the Fort with great pomp, and as kindly received by
Mon&s;ieur General. Some few days after &s;everal of the Gal|lants
of <HI>Batavia</HI> came picquiering to the Hou&s;e to &s;ee Ma|dam
Niece; and &s;o it was, that all being &s;mitten, every one
de&s;ired her in Marriage: but both Uncle and Aunt were
deaf to all their Suits, as having de&s;ign'd her to a young rich
Merchant, who was then out of the way. <HI>C. Ro&s;&s;e</HI> laugh'd
in his &s;leeve at the bu&s;tle that was made, and &s;till continued
his former re&s;pects and double Diligences, which were the
more willingly permitted him in regard of the great care of
<PB N="68" REF="58">
their Niece, for which the Uncle and the Aunt thought
them&s;elves oblig'd to him during their Voyage. But at
length &s;eeing &s;uch a &s;warm of Sweethearts about her, he
thought it but charity to undeceive &s;o many poor Gulls, and
without further ceremony to go to her Aunt, and to demand
her Niece for his Wife. The She General who look'd up|on
her&s;elf to be a kind of a Queen at <HI>Batavia,</HI> look'd upon
it as a high offence and indignity for a Tarpaulin Captain
of a Ship to dare to make her &s;uch a Propo&s;al, having alrea|dy
refus'd &s;uch Matches, per&s;ons that might come to be
Privy Coun&s;ellors of all the <HI>Indies.</HI> Neverthele&s;s within a
day or two after the Captain renewed his Charge, but then
in a Maje&s;tic Fury &s;he utterly forbid him the Fort. He ta|king
little notice of her rage, goes to the General, and after
&s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e makes the &s;ame Propo&s;al, and receives the
&s;ame An&s;wer. But then the Captain gave the Husband
&s;uch a Bone to pick, that he would not give the Wife; Sir,
&s;aid he, twice already have I demanded your Niece in Mar|riage,
this is now the third time that I make the &s;ame de|mand;
if you refu&s;e me, you &s;hall ask me four times before
I accept of her: and &s;o &s;aying briskly left him. The Gene|ral
reflecting upon the Captain's words, went to his Wife
and told her the Story, who gue&s;&s;ing at the effects of a long
Voyage Familiarity, call'd Madam Niece into examination:
She not being us'd to Di&s;&s;imulation confe&s;s'd the whole mat|ter,
and without any more to do was married to the Cap|tain,
to the great wonder of the whole City, till the birth
of a Boy at the end of &s;ix moneths unfolded the Riddle. But
this lying in was her ruin; for about five or &s;ix days after,
the Mother and the Nur&s;e being ill, the chief Chirurgeon
of the Fort order'd them to take a little <HI>Cremor Tartar;</HI> and
to that purpo&s;e &s;ent a young man to the Ma&s;ter Chirurgeon
of the Town, to &s;end him two quantities of <HI>Cremor Tartar</HI>
in two Papers. He being drinking with his Friends, &s;ends a
young Barber newly come from <HI>Holland,</HI> to put up the two
quantities according to direction. But the Barber mi&s;took
the Gla&s;s, and put up <HI>Sublimate</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Cremor Tartar.</HI> So
the two Women taking their Do&s;es, di&s;&s;olved in two Silver
Cups of fair Water, died in 24 hours after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of General Vanderbroug, and of the Original
of the City of Batavia</HEAD>
<P>GEneral <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> was of <HI>Anver&s;e,</HI> and having &s;tu|died
in the Je&s;uits College, retained &s;ome tincture
of Learning, which he endeavoured to improve
as much as his bu&s;ine&s;s would give him leave. While he
was General he caus'd the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be tran&s;lated out of
<HI>Arabic</HI> into <HI>Dutch.</HI> He was al&s;o a man of courage, and &s;e|veral
times expos'd him&s;elf to great hazards for the Service
of the Company, as you &s;hall &s;ee by the following Re|lation.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had taken &s;everal Prizes from the
<HI>Portuguezes</HI> by Sea, they wanted a place of Retreat, where
they might repair their endamaged Ships, and repo&s;e after
the toils of the Sea. At fir&s;t they ca&s;t their eyes upon the
I&s;land of <HI>Java,</HI> in that place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had built a
&s;mall Convenience for their Trade. There is a Road in
that part, where Ve&s;&s;els ride &s;ecurely all the year, into which
a River di&s;charges it &s;elf that will receive Shallops of good
burthen, for above a thou&s;and Paces. The Water of this
River is mo&s;t excellent; for being carried never &s;o far to
Sea, it never &s;tinks, nor engenders Worms; which can only
be &s;aid of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> therefore came and lay upon the point of
a River, over again&s;t the place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had their
&s;mall Hou&s;e. They had with them then the greate&s;t part
of the Ships which they had in the <HI>Indies,</HI> laden with tho&s;e
great Bales of Cloth which come from <HI>Bengale</HI> and the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Surat,</HI> &s;o big that a dozen men can hardly manage them&punc;
The&s;e Bales they landed, and of them made a kind of Forti|fication,
planting a good number of great Guns between
them: For they never wanted great Guns ever &s;ince they
traded alone to <HI>Japon,</HI> the onely Kingdom of the World
abounding in Copper; from whence they brought prodigi|ous
quantities to <HI>Macao</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> where they ca&s;t their Artil|lery.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="59">
Thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thought that by Sea no body could
endamage their &s;mall Fortification, made of Bales of cloth,
which was defended by their Ve&s;&s;els which they had in the
Road: But by Land they were afraid that the King of
the I&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> either of <HI>Materan</HI> or <HI>Bantam,</HI> might di|&s;turb
them. Ob&s;erving therefore the Situation of the I&s;land,
which on that &s;ide was all covered with Woods, which
reached on that &s;ide within a League of the Sea; and that
where they ended, to the Shoar there was no other way but
a Bank, which &s;eparated the Mar&s;h from the River: So that
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> the better to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the
two Kings, re&s;olved to rai&s;e a Tower upon the Bank. In
this Tower they planted &s;everal Culverins and &s;mall Pieces,
cramm'd with artificial Wildfire, and every evening relieved
their Guards. The King of <HI>Materan</HI> perceiving this, and
believing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not &s;top here, advanced
a powerful Army to pull down the Tower. To which
purpo&s;e he brought with him great Chains of Iron, and
Cables made of the <HI>Coco</HI> Flax; believing that by the favour
of the Night, having got his Chains and Ropes about the
Tower, by the &s;trength of his Men and Elephants he might
ea&s;ily pull it down. But having fail'd in his Enterprize, and
for that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Artillery kill'd him abundance of
Men, he retreated with his Army. But it was not long be|fore
he return'd again with a more powerful Force by Land,
and al&s;o a great Fleet of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els to a&s;&s;i&s;t him by Sea.
With the&s;e Forces he gave a furious On&s;et a &s;econd time,
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with no le&s;s vigour &s;u&s;tained, and beat
him off. But nothing di&s;couraged with his lo&s;s, he re&s;olved
to give a third On&s;et, onely he &s;taid &s;ome few days in expe|ctation
of more Forces.</P>
<P>In the mean while one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Captains
of his Army was accus'd to the King not to have done his
Duty: though &s;ea&s;onably advertiz'd that the King was re|&s;olv'd
to &s;eize upon his per&s;on, and cut him to pieces. For
you mu&s;t know, that among the <HI>Javans</HI> when any per&s;on
has merited Death, they tie the Offender all along upon a
great piece of Timber, and the next Lord or great per&s;on
that has a mind to try the goodne&s;s of his Scimitar, comes
and cuts the Body into four pieces, the fir&s;t &s;troak being made
upon the Bre&s;t, the &s;econd upon the Pit of the Stomach, the
<PB N="71" REF="59">
third upon the lower part of the Belly. The four pieces
if they be Men, are burnt; if Women, thrown to the Dogs,
which they keep for that purpo&s;e. For the <HI>Javans</HI> never
burn any per&s;on.</P>
<P>This <HI>Javane&s;e</HI> Lord therefore knowing what he was to
tru&s;t to, made his e&s;cape to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and was kindly
received by <HI>Vanderbroug.</HI> To ingratiate him&s;elf, he told
the <HI>Dutch</HI> General all the King's De&s;igns in reference to the
carrying the place; where he would make his On&s;et, and
what number of men he had. This however did not &s;uffi|ciently
chear up the General, who knew his own weakne&s;s.
So that the <HI>Javane&s;e</HI> perceiving him &s;till pen&s;ive, I find (&s;aid
he) that thou art afraid of the King's &s;trength, and rea&s;on
thou ha&s;t, but be rul'd by me: Thou art not ignorant that
the <HI>Javanners</HI> are rigid Ob&s;ervers of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
and that if any Uncleanne&s;s from a Chri&s;tian hand falls upon
their Clothes, they fling them away, and &s;pend &s;ix whole
days in wa&s;hing them&s;elves, before they believe them&s;elves
clean. Hear then, &s;aid he; let all the Ordure and Dung of
the People that are with thee be heaped in a place together,
and made fluid in Pots for that purpo&s;e; and when they
mount their Ladders, &s;pare not for Showres of that Liquor,
and I warrant ye they will retreat fa&s;ter than they came on.
Farther continued he; I know that the points of their Ar|rows
and <HI>Cric's</HI> are poi&s;on'd, and that this poi&s;on is &s;o
&s;trong, that whoever are wounded therewith die &s;uddenly,
unle&s;s they have recour&s;e to this onely Remedy; which is to
pre&s;erve their own Excrement, and to dry it to powder;
and when they find them&s;elves wounded, to take a little of
the powder, and drink it off in a &s;mall Beer-gla&s;s of Water.
The General ob&s;erving what the <HI>Javan</HI> Lord had &s;aid, when
the Enemy mounted their Ladders, lu&s;tily be&s;mear'd them
with the Liquor, which he caus'd to be prepar'd again&s;t their
coming; &s;o that in&s;tead of gaining the tops of their Ladders,
they made all the ha&s;te they could down again; but being
hindred by tho&s;e that follow'd them, they threw them&s;elves
headlong to the ground; by which means &s;everal of them
were maimed, and &s;everal kill'd outright. Thus the Army
disbanded in a moment, and the Emperour was the fir&s;t that
took his flight. <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> ob&s;erving the di&s;orderly Re|treat
of the Enemy, took a &s;mall Party with him, and pur|&s;u'd
<PB N="72" REF="60">
the flying Enemy, who being enclo&s;ed by tho&s;e in the
Fort, that &s;ally'd out upon them, were mi&s;erably cut in pie|ces.
But the General having left the greate&s;t part of his
men, and returning onely with a &s;mall and very incon&s;ider|able
Company, the <HI>Javanners</HI> who had hid them&s;elves in
the Mer&s;hes for fear, re&s;um'd courage, and &s;uddenly fell up|on
him in his return, and &s;o encompa&s;s'd him on every &s;ide,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape. However they de|fended
them&s;elves &s;toutly for a while, but being wounded
with the Arrows and <HI>Cric's</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and not being
provided of the forementioned Antidote, they died imme|diately.
The General was taken alive, not &s;o much as
wounded; for as he told me afterwards him&s;elf, he found
they had no de&s;ire to kill him. So &s;oon as he was taken
they carried him to the Emperour, who as &s;oon as he &s;aw
him bid him not fear any thing, but told him withall, that
it was his plea&s;ure, that he &s;hould command his Men to
quit the Fort and Tower, and be gone; otherwi&s;e that he
would make both him, and all tho&s;e that &s;hould fall into
his Hands, perpetual Slaves. At the &s;ame time the Empe|rour
with his principal Officers, and the General with a good
Guard, came to the Foot of the Wall of the Tower, where
the General in the <HI>Malay</HI> Language, laying before them
his own misfortune, and the improbability of their holding
out long, commanded them to quit the Fort, after they had
embarqued whatever they &s;aw fitting, but onely 6 Pieces of
&s;mall Canon, 200 Bullets, and 500 Quintals of Powder.
The Emperour was overjoy'd to hear what the General &s;aid,
and thought him&s;elf &s;ure of the Fort and Tower. But then
the General turning to the Emperour, told him, that none
of his men under&s;tood <HI>Malay,</HI> and that therefore it would
be convenient for him to repeat the &s;ame in <HI>Flemi&s;h.</HI>
Which being granted, he &s;poke to the Souldiers in <HI>Flemi&s;h,</HI>
and ordered them quite the contrary; that is to &s;ay, that
they &s;hould not be Traitors to their Countrey, but hold out
the place till death, not minding what became of him; and
to that end, that they &s;hould bid the Infidels forthwith re|tire,
or el&s;e they would immediately fire all their Guns up|on
them. The Emperour a&s;toni&s;h'd at their Re&s;olution re|treats,
and carries the General with him. Being thus re|tir'd,
the General made him believe that he would find a
<PB N="73" REF="60">
means to write to the Company, to give them an account
of what had pa&s;s'd, and that he was confident they would
give &s;uch order for an Accommodation, as &s;hould &s;atisfie
His Maje&s;ty, which &s;atisfi'd the Emperour for that time. In
the mean while the General found an opportunity to get
into a &s;mall Barque, and to get to the Fort, where he was joy|fully
receiv'd. This Recital I had from his own mouth.</P>
<P>The General having done this and &s;everal other eminent
Services for the Company, and acquitted him&s;elf with Re|putation
and a fair E&s;tate, was de&s;irous to return home,
where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and &s;everal of the States had
no le&s;s a de&s;ire to &s;ee him. Streight he took up his Habita|tion
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and for a good while liv'd &s;plendidly,
gave great Pre&s;ents and Entertainments to the Prince, and
&s;everal other Grandees of <HI>Holland,</HI> by which means he ran
him&s;elf into &s;o great an Expence, that he was forc'd to de|&s;ire
of the Company, that he might return into their Ser|vice.</P>
<P>One day the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> asking him what Rarities
he had brought out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> he call'd for five Silver
Plates, and &s;etting them upon the Table, drew out five
little Bags out of his Pocket, and emptied a &s;everal Bag up|on
a &s;everal Plate; which &s;urpriz'd not onely the Prince,
but &s;everal others of the States then pre&s;ent, to &s;ee &s;uch a
number of Diamonds and other Jewels of a va&s;t value.</P>
<P>It was not without &s;ome difficulty that he was again en|tertain'd
by the Company; but at length they &s;ent him Ad|miral
of two Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where being arriv'd, the Ge|neral
and Con&s;uls made him Admiral of the Fleet that was
ju&s;t bound for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel, Surat,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Being return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> General <HI>Vandyme</HI> and the Coun|cil
&s;ent him to <HI>Malaca,</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> then be&s;ieg'd,
and where they found a &s;touter re&s;i&s;tance than they imagin'd.
There in an a&s;&s;ault upon the Town he received a &s;light
Wound, of which he was quickly cur'd; but &s;oon after he
fell &s;ick, and died before the Town was &s;urrendred.</P>

<P>When you leave the Countries of the&s;e Princes, which
they call <HI>Rajas,</HI> travelling toward the North Ea&s;t you enter

large extent. He and all his Subjects being Idolaters, un|le&s;s

S. <HI>John</HI> baptiz'd the People in the Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After the taking of <HI>Cochin,</HI> of which we have given a full
Relation in our <HI>Indian</HI> Travels, General <HI>Vangous,</HI> who com|manded
at the Siege, became &s;o haughty that he de&s;pis'd
all the other Officers, as well Military as tho&s;e that belonged
to the Government and Ju&s;tice of the City. However to
recompence one of the <HI>Raja's</HI> by who&s;e means he had ta|ken
the City, he per&s;uaded him to quit the Name of <HI>Raja,</HI>
and to a&s;&s;ume the Title of <HI>King,</HI> that he might have the
Honour to &s;et the Crown upon his Head. To this end he
made great inquiry through his whole Army for a Gold|&s;mith,
<PB N="75" REF="61">
and having found out one that undertook it, and
caus'd him to make a Crown of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, that weigh'd
near ten Marks, which I believe the <HI>Raja</HI> found more in|convenient
and weighty upon his Head, than an old Muc|kender
with three corners bound about his Head, which is the
mark of the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Sovereignty.</P>
<P>While they were making this Crown there were great
preparations for the Ceremony: It was performed in a Gar|den
near the Town, where was &s;et a large Tent &s;pread all
over with painted Calicut. Within was a Throne erected
with a Canopy of <HI>China</HI> Damask, and all the Steps to the
Throne were cover'd with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tapi&s;try.</P>
<P>The day being come, the greate&s;t part of the Army, Offi|cers
and Souldiers, went to fetch the <HI>Raja,</HI> who lay in his
Hut a quarter of a League off; where they mounted him
upon one of two Elephants which the General &s;ent him, be|ing
attended likewi&s;e with two led Hor&s;es, and two <HI>Palan|quins</HI>
for more State. Being come to the place, he was clad
in a Scarlet Robe with great Hanging Sleeves, and &s;o brought
in where <HI>Vangous</HI> was &s;itting upon his Throne, with a
Sword and a Crown by him. The <HI>Raja</HI> being come to the
Foot of the Throne, the Major of the Army took the Sword,
deliver'd him by the General, and girt the <HI>Raja,</HI> who then
a&s;cending the Steps of the Throne, pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore
the <HI>Holland</HI> General while he put the Crown upon his
Head. Then the new King ri&s;eth up, and lays his Hand
upon the Head of a Cow that &s;tood near the Throne. Which
done, kneeling with his Hands cla&s;p'd, and lifted toward
the Head of the &s;ame Cow, he took his Oath to be true and
faithful to the Company, and to embrace their Intere&s;ts.
On the other &s;ide the General promis'd him on the behalf of

very gravely perform'd, the Mu&s;quettiers gave three
Volleys, and the new King was conducted back to his Hut

Pride of a Pepper Merchant, to make Kings and domineer
over Crowns.</P>
<P>One other famous Act of <HI>Vangous</HI> mu&s;t not be forgotten.
You mu&s;t know, that at the taking of <HI>Cochin</HI> the Je&s;uits had
in that City one of the faire&s;t Libraries in all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as well
<PB N="76" REF="62">
for the great quantity of Books &s;ent them out of <HI>Europe,</HI> as
for &s;everal rare Manu&s;cripts in the <HI>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic,
Per&s;ian, Indian, Chine&s;e,</HI> and other Oriental Languages. For
in all the Conque&s;ts of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> their fir&s;t care was to
&s;ummon all the Learned People of the &s;everal Nations, and
to get all their Books into their hands. During that little
time which the Je&s;uits &s;taid in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> they had copied out
all the good Books that came to their knowledge, and &s;ent
all tho&s;e Books of <HI>Cochin.</HI> They had &s;taid longer in <HI>Aethio|pia,</HI>
had it not been for the Jealou&s;ie of the Patriarchs, and
their Bi&s;hops, which are very numerous; &s;o that if there be
two men in one Village that belong to one Church, the chief|e&s;t
calls him&s;elf Bi&s;hop. At their Ceremonies of Bapti&s;m
when they name the Holy Gho&s;t, they apply a hot Iron to
the neck of the Infant, &s;aying that the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended
upon the Apo&s;tles in the &s;hape of Fiery Tongues. The Pa|triarchs
and Bi&s;hops were jealous of the Je&s;uits, finding that
they had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the favour of the King
and Grandees of the Court. Which &s;o enraged the <HI>Aethiopi|ans,</HI>
that they caus'd the People to mutiny, preaching that
the King was about to alter the Religion of the Country, and
to draw along with him &s;everal of the Lords. And the
Fury of the People grew to that height, that whatever the
King could do or &s;ay, he could not appea&s;e their Fury: So
that they put him in pri&s;on, and elected his Brother in his
place. The cau&s;e of this di&s;order was laid upon the Je&s;uits,
and was the rea&s;on that they were expell'd the Kingdom;
neither had they &s;cap'd &s;o, but that they were afraid of the
Governour of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and the <HI>Portugals</HI> that inhabit all
along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> But to tell ye what became of
this Library, General <HI>Vangous</HI> made no con&s;cience to expo&s;e
it to the ignorance of his Souldiers, &s;o that I have &s;een the
Souldiers and Seamen tear &s;everal of tho&s;e beautiful Volums
to light their Tobacco.</P>

<P>WHen the Ships come to <HI>Ormus,</HI> it is a great pre|judice
for the Goods to lie out of doors. For
&s;uch is the extremity of the Heat in that part,
that if the Spices, e&s;pecially the Cloves, be not carried to the
Water-&s;ide every foot, and there laid to &s;teep in the Water
for four and twenty hours, they would turn to a mere

<P>Sugar is brought thither in great Wooden Che&s;ts, but if

&s;mall time the Che&s;t will be half emptied.</P>
<P>As for Camphire, which is brought from <HI>Borneo</HI> in Pipes,
if it lie a little too long in that warm Air, it will exhale above
half away.</P>
<P>To remedy the&s;e Inconveniences <HI>Sieur Hollebrand</HI> re&s;ol|ved
to build a bigger Warehou&s;e. Among the re&s;t of the
Workmen that were imployed in this Building was a Gun|&s;mith,
who came in the <HI>interim</HI> in a Ship from <HI>Batavia.</HI>
This poor Fellow was imployed to make Locks for the
Warehou&s;e; for in tho&s;e Parts they have no other Keys, or
Locks either, than what are made of Wood: So that it was
a Crime for him to be found idle at any time. And there|fore
the Pre&s;ident finding him one Sunday in the Afternoon
drinking with two of his Companions that came from the
Ship to &s;ee him, gave the Fellow half a dozen good Licks
with his Cane, and would have given him more, but that
the Smith being a &s;turdy Fellow, and feeling the Blows &s;mart,
wre&s;ted the Stick out of the Pre&s;ident's Hands, and flung it
out of the Window. For which the Pre&s;ident, upon pre|tence
that the Fellow had &s;truck him four Blows, which was
untrue, as I my &s;elf being there could witne&s;s, &s;ent him la|den
with Chains to the Ship, where he would have tried
him for his Life, in a full Court of the Merchants of the Fa|ctory:
but they refu&s;ing him, for very madne&s;s he took
<PB N="78" REF="63">
two Notaries, that he had a power over, went to the Ship
alone, made the Officers of the Ship, and condemn'd the
Fellow to be hang'd. And he had certainly been executed
but for me and &s;ome other of my Countrymen, (for the Fel|low
was of <HI>Geneva</HI>) that threatned the Pre&s;ident out of his
de&s;ign. Yet he caus'd him to be drubb'd Naked at the
Main Ma&s;t after that inhuman manner, that he lo&s;t the u&s;e
of one of his Arms. This the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> could never forget,
and therefore &s;ought all opportunities to kill him; to which
purpo&s;e he put him&s;elf in the &s;ame Ship with <HI>Hollebrand</HI>
when he returned for <HI>Holland.</HI> But coming to the <HI>Cape of
Good Hope,</HI> and being &s;ent a&s;hoar in the Shallop for Provi&s;i|ons,
the Shallop was over&s;et in a &s;tormy Sea, and <HI>Hollebrand</HI>'s
Life thereby &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>But before we leave <HI>Ormus,</HI> where <HI>Hollebrand</HI> was build|ing
his Warehou&s;e that caus'd all this mi&s;chief, let us take
notice of this by the way, that there is no abiding at <HI>Ormus</HI>

in the Port of <HI>Alexandretta</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and in the I&s;lands

<P>By the way ob&s;erve, that there is a particular &s;ort of Nut|meg

being plainly ob&s;erv'd to &s;ink, and requiring Repa|ration

the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wanted Slaves: whereupon a Con&s;ultation
was had where to get Slaves. To which An&s;wer was made,
that there was no better place than the Prince's I&s;lands.
Which being concluded, the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> di&s;patch'd
away three the bigge&s;t Ships belonging to <HI>Batavia.</HI> The&s;e

came from <HI>Holland</HI> and wanted Refre&s;hment. So &s;oon as
the Inhabitants di&s;cover'd the Ve&s;&s;els, they flock'd to the

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Hollanders &s;ent to declare War against the
Per&s;ians, and of the ill Succe&s;s of their Fleet.</HEAD>
<P>MUch about the &s;ame time <HI>Charles Con&s;tant</HI> was &s;ent
by the Company with a Fleet of &s;even great
Ships, to declare War again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> in ca&s;e
they would not comply with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in reference to their
Silk Trade and their Cu&s;toms. Being arriv'd at <HI>Ormus</HI> he
left the Fleet there, and ha&s;ten'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Casbin,</HI> where then the King was. But his Emba&s;&s;ie had
not that effect as he expected: For he thought that the King
would have been frighted at the noi&s;e of a Fleet of &s;even
great Ships that lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> but he was mi&s;taken. For
the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> knew he need not &s;end any Force again&s;t the
&s;aid Fleet, in regard it would be ruin'd without: It being
impo&s;&s;ible for our <HI>Europeans</HI> to &s;tay at <HI>Ormus</HI> in the heat of
Somer, as well by rea&s;on of the Heat, as for want of Water;
for there is no good Water at <HI>Ormus,</HI> nor upon any part of
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but what is kept in Ci&s;terns, and that
full of Worms. 'Tis true, that upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia</HI>
there are Wells of good Water, but when the <HI>Arabians</HI> di&s;|cover
any Ships upon the Coa&s;t, they come down all in
Arms to defend their Wells; for it is their profit to &s;ell their
Water, and that at a very dear rate, to tho&s;e that are in ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now the King and Council not being ignorant, that the
longer the Fleet lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> the wor&s;e would be its con|dition,
would not give the Commander his fir&s;t Audience
in two moneths. During which time there died above half
the Men; for from &s;ix a clock in the morning till four in the
afternoon, if any of the Seamen went to take a little Air
upon the Deck, he pre&s;ently fell down dead. The Admi|ral
was to blame not to make provi&s;ion of Water being
bound for &s;uch a place as <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Commander <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> did not take the right cour&s;e
to effect his bu&s;ine&s;s, by publi&s;hing what he intended to pre|&s;ent
<PB N="81" REF="64">
the Mini&s;ters of State withall. For the Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>
never take any Pre&s;ents them&s;elves, for fear it &s;hould come
to the King's Ear. But there is a private Bill &s;ent to the
Party for whom it is intended, and he &s;ends whom he thinks
fit to receive it. Had he &s;o done, and doubled his Sum of
5000 <HI>Venetian</HI> Ducats, perhaps the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> might have
us'd him more kindly, e&s;pecially for &s;o long time as that
King had. For whatever a Predece&s;&s;or does, a Succe&s;&s;or
changes many things. So that if the decea&s;ed King have
given any Hou&s;e or Land to any per&s;on, it mu&s;t be confirm|ed
by the &s;ucceeding King in his fir&s;t Year, or el&s;e the Gift
returns to the King. It is the &s;ame thing if any per&s;on builds
a Hou&s;e upon the King's Deme&s;ns: which has been a great
inconvenience to the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> Friers and bare-foot <HI>Carmelites,</HI>
becau&s;e their Hou&s;es are built upon the Lands which
<HI>Cha Abbas</HI> gave them of the Royal Deme&s;ns. So that
every time a new King a&s;cends the Throne, they are forc'd
to make the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> new Pre&s;ents, &s;ometimes to the
Value of the Land: for it is a rare thing to find a prime
Mini&s;ter that is a Friend to the Chri&s;tians&punc; But the Je&s;uits
and Capuchins, who came after them, provided better for
them&s;elves, each of tho&s;e Orders having bought the Ground
upon which their Hou&s;es are built.</P>
<P>The Commander &s;eeing that he could not compa&s;s his
De&s;ign, and that the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> would abate nothing of
the forty four <HI>Tomans</HI> which he demanded, went to the
<HI>Divanbegai</HI> and told him, that buying the &s;ame Goods of
particular per&s;ons, they might be had for thirty two, or at
mo&s;t for thirty three <HI>Tomans.</HI> To which the <HI>Divanbegai</HI> an|&s;wered
him, That all tho&s;e particular per&s;ons paid the King
Cu&s;tom, and Convoy upon the Road, the Cu&s;tom alone
amounting to Eighteen <HI>per cent.</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did
not pay: and that there was not a Year wherein they did
not bring in Goods to the Value of 30000 <HI>Tomans;</HI> and that
if account &s;hould be taken of the Silks which they carried
away, and of the Goods which they brought in, the <HI>Athema|doulet</HI>
ought to make them pay near 50000 <HI>Tomans</HI> for Du|ties.
The Commander ill &s;atisfied with this An&s;wer went
to his Lodging, and without asking the Advice of the Mer|chants
that were with him, or of his <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who better
under&s;tood the Practice of the Court, or without taking his
<PB N="82" REF="65">
leave of the King, return'd privately to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> intending
for <HI>Bander</HI> where the Fleet lay. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> being
advertiz'd of his &s;udden departure, was very much offend|ed;
&s;o much the more becau&s;e at the Commanders fir&s;t Ar|rival
he had done him great Civilities, even to the furni&s;h|ing
his Lodgings after the <HI>European</HI> manner, with a Bed,
Stools, and Tables. Thereupon he gave notice thereof to
the King, who when he heard of it utter'd the&s;e words,
<HI>Has any one given him any di&s;ta&s;te, or is he turn'd Fool? He &s;hall be
glad to come back again.</HI></P>
<P>Being come to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to the great wonder of the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who heard nothing of his taking leave of the King, he be|gan
to make up his Pack, intending for <HI>Gomrom,</HI> in ca&s;e the
King did not &s;end for him again; which he did, 'tis true, but
not with tho&s;e Compliments which he expected; for he
flatter'd him&s;elf that the King would have petition'd him to
return. The King &s;ent for him indeed, but his Compliment
was not very plea&s;ing; for the per&s;on that brought the
Me&s;&s;age told him, That it was the King's plea&s;ure he &s;hould
&s;peedily return, and if he would not go willingly he had
order to carry him by force. But notwith&s;tanding the King's
Command and the Coun&s;el of his Friends, he &s;et out from
<HI>I&s;pahan</HI> for <HI>Bander,</HI> according to his fir&s;t intent. We accom|panied
him &s;ome part of his way, and being ju&s;t ready to
take our leaves, we &s;aw a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gentile and well mount|ed,
(he was a Captain of an hundred men) who calling the
Interpreter to him, Go (&s;aid he) and tell thy Pre&s;ident, that
he mu&s;t return to his Lodging, and to morrow make ha&s;te
to the King, according to the Order he has already recei|ved:
and with that he rode away full &s;peed. The Inter|preter
told the Commander what the Captain &s;aid; but not|with&s;tanding
all this the Commander being a per&s;on of a
hot and ob&s;tinate humour, continued his way. Neither the
Merchants of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> nor any of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI>
Servants would follow him, fearing the Ba&s;tinado, and be|lieving
he was &s;ecure enough; as it happen'd: for he had
not rode far, before three Captains with their Bows and Ar|rows
in their hands bolted out upon him, one of which ri|ding
up directly to the Commander, Art thou (&s;aid he) the
onely per&s;on that ever &s;et foot in this Empire, that refu&s;e&s;t
to obey the Companion of the Sun, whom &s;o great a part
<PB N="83" REF="65">
of the World obeys? At the &s;ame time came up fifty &s;tout
Hor&s;emen, and one of them who cammanded them made
at Mr. <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> with his Mace. Then the Admiral was
forc'd to lower his Sails and return back, forc'd to receive an
Affront which he might have avoided&punc; When he was come
to his Lodging, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Officer without alighting call'd
the Interpreter, and bid him go forwarn the Commander
in the Name of the King, that neither he nor any of the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> pre&s;umed to &s;tir out of their Hou&s;es till further
order; for that if any of them were &s;een abroad, they &s;hould
be taught to obey the King's Commands. Thus the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
having been coop'd up nine days, word was brought
the Commander he might return to <HI>Cusbin,</HI> where he found
that all his <HI>Rodomontado's</HI> &s;ignified nothing, but that he mu&s;t

of I&s;&s;ue. Great Provi&s;ions were made again&s;t the Lying in,
and the General him&s;elf made choice of for Godfather. But
when the good hour was come, and the Woman delivered,
their Joy was turned into Mourning, for the Child prov'd
one of the &s;ooty Of-&s;pring of the Sun-burnt race, a perfect
Black. The Husband and Mother of the Woman blu&s;h'd as
red for &s;hame as the Child was black, and the Go&s;&s;ips hung
down their heads like Bulru&s;hes: nay the Husband was &s;o
tran&s;ported with fury, that he could not hide his re&s;olution
to murder his Wife, for bringing &s;uch a piece of live Char|cole
into the world. But he was prevented, and &s;ecur'd in
the Fort by the General, till by the intermi&s;&s;ion of Friends,
who wi&s;ely laid before him the original cau&s;e of his Wifes
<PB N="86" REF="67">
Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they were at length made Friends, and the
Slave for having &s;hew'd him&s;elf a Man, was condemn'd to
tug at the Oars in the Galleys that go to fetch Stone for the
u&s;e of the City.</P>
<P>Now as a White Woman may bring forth a Black, &s;o
&s;ometimes a Black may be deliver'd of a White Child. For
at <HI>Ba&ccedil;aim</HI> a <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Wife, as black as him&s;elf, was deli|ver'd
of a white Child. The <HI>Cafer</HI> &s;eeing his Child white,
would have immediately fallen upon his Wife and &s;trangled
her, had not the good women that a&s;&s;i&s;ted at her Labour
prevented him, and one of tho&s;e Go&s;&s;ips was &s;o cunning as
to run to the Je&s;uits Hou&s;e, who are well re&s;pected by
tho&s;e Blacks, to de&s;ire Father <HI>Thomas de Bare,</HI> who had a
long time been Rector at <HI>Agra,</HI> to come to the <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Hou&s;e.
Pre&s;ently the Father came with another of the Fraternity,
and finding the <HI>Cafer</HI> &s;tamping and &s;taring almo&s;t out of
his wits, and in open ho&s;tility without all rea&s;on, to ap|pea&s;e
his fury ask'd him whether he kept any Hens, and
whether he had any that were black. The <HI>Cafer</HI> an&s;wer'd
that he did keep Hens, and that he had likewi&s;e black Hens.
Pre&s;ently the Father order'd one to be brought him; and
then holding it in both his hands before the good Women,
Does this Hen (&s;aid he to the <HI>Cafer</HI>) lay thee any Eggs?
Yes, replied the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Of what colour are they, &s;aid the
Father? White, an&s;wer'd the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Well then, &s;aid the
Father, thou art wor&s;e than thy &s;illy Creature, and ha&s;t far
le&s;s rea&s;on; for if this Hen which is black lay thee white
Eggs, why may not thy Wife which is black bring thee a
white Child? This Compari&s;on &s;o wrought upon the
<HI>Cafer,</HI> who was no Di&s;putant, that he embrac'd his Wife,
ki&s;s'd his Child, and all was well again. Though for all
the Je&s;uit's Compari&s;on it was believ'd that &s;ome <HI>Portugal</HI>
Souldier had quarter'd with his Wife, which was the rea&s;on
of that more than u&s;ual Production.</P>
<P>To conclude, there was a certain woman, the wife of
one of the Coun&s;ellors of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who had both kindne&s;s
and affection for a Merchant of the Fort, who was both
young and hand&s;om. And it is the Cu&s;tom in that Coun|trey
to be not onely kind but free, &s;he had for &s;everal years
&s;o well &s;upplied his wants, that he was Company for the
be&s;t. It happen'd that this Coun&s;ellor was &s;ent abroad up|on
<PB N="87" REF="67">
&s;ome Negotiation, and &s;taid longer than he thought he
&s;hould have done. For this rea&s;on Money grew &s;hort with
the Lady; &s;o that her Gallant coming for a Supply, and &s;he
not having ready money to an&s;wer his Expectations, &s;he
gave him a Gold Chain worth 400 Crowns to pawn for his
pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities till &s;he could redeem it. But this Fatal
Chain was the di&s;&s;olution of all their former Love: For the
young Gentleman being &s;treighten'd for Money, and find|ing
no per&s;on that would lend him &s;o much Money as he
wanted upon it, very fairly goes and offers it to a Gold&s;mith
to &s;ell. While this unfortunate Lover was driving his Bar|gain
in the Shop, who in the name of ill luck &s;hould come
by but one of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Slaves, and &s;pying the Chain in
his hand, runs and tells her Patrone&s;s how &s;he had &s;een her
Gallant imploy'd. Who &s;urpriz'd that her Gallant &s;hould
go about to &s;ell the Chain, when he had onely promis'd to
pawn it in private and &s;ure hands; now (quoth &s;he) all will
out, there will be the Devil upon Dun when my Husband
comes home; and I for&s;ooth that have liv'd credibly thus
long, mu&s;t be the &s;port of my Neighbours and the talk of
the Town. This produc'd a Duel between Love and In|tere&s;t,
wherein Intere&s;t getting the victory, away &s;he im|mediately
&s;ends to all the Gold&s;miths, to give them notice
that &s;he had been robb'd of a Gold Chain, de&s;iring them to
apprehend the Party that brought it. She al&s;o gave the &s;ame
notice to the chief of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and de&s;ir'd the Advocate
Fi&s;cal to make a public Search. Well, by the&s;e means the
Chain was quickly found, and the Merchant whatever he
could &s;ay for him&s;elf was apprehended and put in pri&s;on;
&s;oon after he was condemned for a Thief, and &s;entenced to
row all his life in the Stone Galley, which is the Galley
that fetches Stones for the u&s;e of <HI>Batavia.</HI> But happy for
him, General <HI>Vanderlin</HI>'s Lady falling into a hard Labour
before the time of Execution, and de&s;iring his Pardon at
&s;uch a &s;olemn Juncture, ea&s;ily obtain'd it, &s;ea&s;onably reco|vering
him from the Misfortunes of Folly and Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF
JAPON,
AND
Of the Cau&s;e of the Per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians
in tho&s;e ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Modern Geographers have made
De&s;criptions of <HI>Japon,</HI> by means of
&s;uch conjectures as they have drawn
from the Relations of certain Mer|chants
who have traded in tho&s;e
Countries. But in regard there are
very few Merchants who are skilful
in <HI>Geography,</HI> as being &s;uch who only
mind the profit and advantage of
their Voyages, tho&s;e De&s;criptions
have prov'd very uncertain. As to
the knowledge of the Ancients, in
reference to this part of the World,
it is no le&s;s imperfect; and it is but
only by conjecture to this day, that we believe the <HI>Abadii</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy</HI>
to be that I&s;land which is now call'd <HI>Niphon.</HI> That which I could learn
of mo&s;t certainty, was by the Relation of &s;everal per&s;ons who have
Travell'd the&s;e parts, that the Empire of <HI>Japon</HI> is at pre&s;ent compos'd
of &s;everal I&s;lands, of which &s;ome perhaps may not be ab&s;olute I&s;lands,
but rather <HI>Penin&s;ula's,</HI> and particularly tho&s;e that make a part of the
<PB N="2" REF="69">
Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof are Va&s;&s;als and Tributaries to
<HI>Japon.</HI> Neverthele&s;s a <HI>Holland</HI> Pilot, who has been indu&s;trious to
di&s;cover whether the whole Country it &s;elf were an I&s;land, or a
Continent adjoyning to that va&s;t Tract of Land call'd <HI>Corea,</HI> unknown
to this day, in tho&s;e parts where it extends it &s;elf behind <HI>China</HI> to the
bottom of <HI>Tartarie Niulhan,</HI> &s;aith, that it is &s;eparated from <HI>Japon</HI> by a
narrow Sea, which at this day is call'd <HI>The Streights of</HI> Sanguar.
Through all the I&s;lands of <HI>Japon,</HI> where formerly were accompted to
have been 66 Kingdoms, there are three remarkable for their largene&s;s,
of which that of large&s;t extent is called <HI>Niphon,</HI> the next <HI>Ximo,</HI> and
the third <HI>Xicock.</HI> The <HI>Japonners</HI> accompt it a Journey of twenty &s;even
days from the Province of <HI>Quanto,</HI> to the Country of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o;</HI> and they
&s;ay farther, that this Country of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o,</HI> in tho&s;e parts which are remote
from the Sea, is &s;o full of inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains, that tho&s;e <HI>Japonners</HI>
who have attempted a di&s;covery by Land, could never accompli&s;h their
de&s;ign, being di&s;courag'd by the length of the Journey, and the
difficulties and badne&s;s of the ways.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Niphon</HI> is four times as big as the other two; and there
is al&s;o a Mountain therein that vomits up Flames of Fire, like Mount
<HI>Etna</HI> in <HI>Sicily;</HI> formerly it was di&s;tingui&s;h'd into thirty five Kingdoms,
but at this day it is only divided into five parts, the names whereof are
<HI>Jama&s;oit, Jet&s;en, Jet&s;e&s;en, Quanto,</HI> and <HI>Ochio,</HI> lying all in order as you
travel from We&s;t to Ea&s;t. The&s;e five parts are again divided into
&s;everal Provinces. The I&s;land of <HI>Ximo,</HI> or <HI>Saycock,</HI> is &s;ituated to the
South-We&s;t of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 160 Leagues in circuit. The I&s;land
of <HI>Xicock</HI> is &s;eated by the South of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 120 Leagues in
compa&s;s. The other I&s;lands that lye round about are not &s;o con&s;iderable,
for in tho&s;e Seas lye &s;everal I&s;lands &s;catter'd up and down, as in the <HI>Archi|pelago,</HI>
between the <HI>Morea</HI> and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the le&s;s. As to the
re&s;t, I refer the Reader to the Map annexed, believing it to be very
true, as having been made upon the places them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Emperour at pre&s;ent keeps his Court in the City of <HI>Yeddo,</HI> in
regard the Air is there more temperate, and the Heats not &s;o violent;
but when he has a Son that is arriv'd to the Age of fifteen years, he
&s;ends him to <HI>Surunga,</HI> there to re&s;ide, till the death of his Father makes
him way to the Throne.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Yeddo</HI> has been made choice of for the Seat of the Empire, it
has &s;o greatly enlarg'd it &s;elf from day to day, that it is at pre&s;ent three
Leagues in length, and three in breadth, very populous, and the Hou&s;es
&s;tanding very clo&s;e together. When the Emperour rides through the
City, or that there is any publick &s;hew to be &s;een, it is impo&s;&s;ible to get
by the crowd of the people, though the Women are not permitted to be
of the number. The Emperours Palace is cover'd with Plates of Gold,
to which the Palaces of the Lords are every way corre&s;pondent in Mag|nificence;
&s;o that afar off the City affords the riche&s;t and mo&s;t magnifi|cent
Pro&s;pect that was ever beheld: Though it be not &s;o beautiful
within, by rea&s;on that the ordinary Hou&s;es are built only of Wood.
The Great <HI>Dairy</HI> keeps his re&s;idence at <HI>Meaco,</HI> which is al&s;o a very large
City, containing above a hundred thou&s;and Hou&s;es; it was formerly
the capital Seat of the Empire, at what time the <HI>Dairy</HI>'s were laid a&s;ide.
So &s;oon as he is Crown'd by the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> who are the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI>
he is then no more to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the light of the Moon, nor to
<PB N="3" REF="69">
&s;have his Head, or cut his Nails. The Natives report, that the Empire
of <HI>Japon</HI> was formerly govern'd by a Prince call'd <HI>Dairy,</HI> who had
acquir'd &s;o high a reputation for Holine&s;s, that his Subjects ador'd him
as a God, and that to increa&s;e the awe and reverence of the people, he
&s;uffer'd his Hair and Nails to grow, affirming, that it it was a piece of
Sacriledge to make u&s;e either of Razor or Sizzars. The Princes
that &s;ucceeded him, though they had only the name of Kings, have
&s;till pre&s;erv'd the &s;ame cu&s;tom, believing that it becomes not their Gran|deur
to appear in view of the Moon, as being Sons of the <HI>Sun.</HI> If he
have a Daughter that is ripe for Marriage, the Emperour is oblig'd to
Marry her, and &s;he it is that bears the Title of Empre&s;s, though &s;he
&s;hould happen to have no Children, which is contrary to the Maxims
of all the Ea&s;tern Monarchs, who give the Title of Queen and Sulta|ne&s;s
only to her, among all the re&s;t of their Wives, that is fir&s;t brought
to Bed of a Male Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown.</P>
<P>At the end of every &s;even years, the Emperour &s;ends one of the chief
Princes of his Court to the <HI>Dairy</HI> with a Basket full of Earth, and to
tell him, that all the Lands which the Emperour commands, are at the
<HI>Dairy</HI>'s Devotion; and indeed the Empire belongs to him by right of
Succe&s;&s;ion, though at pre&s;ent he enjoys only the Title, and very large
Revenues, which render him highly con&s;iderable in the Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are Idolaters, and adore the Sun; but though they have
a great number of Temples and different Idols, yet they are not over
ob&s;tinate in their Devotion, only the Emperour is very &s;evere again&s;t
all other Religions. They never &s;tir out of their Native Country to
travel, unle&s;s it be to <HI>China,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o;</HI> and within the&s;e
few years the Emperour has prohibited his people under extream penal|ties,
from having any Commerce with Foreigners, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and
<HI>Hollanders</HI> excepted. He had receiv'd Amba&s;&s;adours at &s;everal times
from &s;everal Princes, but never &s;ent any of his own to them again.
Neverthele&s;s it is affirm'd, that &s;everal Lords of the&s;e I&s;lands newly
converted to the Faith, in the year 1585, &s;ent their Children to <HI>Rome,</HI>
to render their acknowledgments to <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth; and that
being return'd back in the year 1587, to <HI>Goa,</HI> they were afterwards
receiv'd, and welcom'd again into their own Country with great marks
of joy. The little inclination which they have to Navigation and
Traffick, proceeds in part from the great abundance of all things nece&s;|&s;ary
for Human &s;upport, which their own Country produces; and then
in the next place from the jealou&s;ies of the Emperour, who is afraid of
the alterations which new Religions may make in his Government;
for they are very fickle, and ea&s;ily &s;educ'd after Novelties, which has been
the occa&s;ion of many Revolts, and Civil Wars, till <HI>Quabacondon</HI> wre&s;ted
the Empire out of the hands of the <HI>Dairy;</HI> and reunited all the Provinces.
They are &s;o fiery and revengeful, that upon the lea&s;t affront given them,
if they cannot have an opportunity of a pre&s;ent revenge, they will rip
up their own Bellies, and kill them&s;elves. I was told a Story to confirm
this. Two young Lords that &s;erv'd the Emperour met in the
Palace, and jo&s;tl'd one the other by accident; the mo&s;t furious of the
two was immediately for drawing his Sword. The other told him, the
place was not convenient, that he was going to wait; but that if he
would &s;tay for him in &s;uch a place, he would give him &s;atisfaction.
Accordingly the party that thought him&s;elf affronted went and &s;tay'd, but
<PB N="4" REF="70">
his impatience was &s;uch, that after he had &s;tay'd a while, not finding
the other to come, he ripp'd up his own Bowels for very vexation.
Upon which the people crowding about him, ask'd him the rea&s;on of
his killing him&s;elf; to which they could draw no other an&s;wer but this,
<HI>A cowardly Raskal has affronted me.</HI> By and by the other comes, makes
way through the throng, and &s;urpriz'd with what he beheld; <HI>Poor
Creature,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou need'st not have doubted my being as good as my word,
this Dagger &s;hall a&s;&s;ure thee of it:</HI> And &s;o &s;aying, he kill'd him&s;elf upon
the place, and fell by the others &s;ide.</P>
<P>There is no Nation under Heaven that fears Death le&s;s than this, or
that is more enclin'd to cruelty. If any Prince or great Lord makes a
Fea&s;t for his Friends, at the end of the Fea&s;t he calls his principal Offi|cers,
and asks 'em, if there be any that has &s;o much love for him as to
kill him&s;elf before the Gue&s;ts for his &s;ake. Pre&s;ently there ari&s;es a
di&s;pute among them who &s;hall have the Honour; and who ever the
Prince is pleas'd to name, rips up his Belly with a <HI>Cric,</HI> which is a kind
of Dagger, the poynt whereof is Poy&s;on'd. This cu&s;tom is al&s;o
practis'd upon the Death of their Ma&s;ters, or when they lay the Foun|dations
of any Palace; for they are &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to believe, that
the&s;e Victims are nece&s;&s;ary to render both the Owners of the Building,
and the Habitation fortunate.</P>
<P>They puni&s;h all manner of Theft with Death. 'Tis al&s;o a capital
Crime among them to play for Money. Adultery is only puni&s;h'd in
the Women: But Coynage of fal&s;e Money, &s;etting Hou&s;es on Fire,
Deflowring and Ravi&s;hing of Virgins, are not only puni&s;h'd in the per&s;ons
of the Criminals, but al&s;o of tho&s;e who are next of kin to them. The
Women live retir'd, and are very faithful to their Husbands. The
Emperour having put to Death one of the Lords of his Court, out of
hopes to enjoy his Wife; &s;he fearing violence, be&s;ought the Emperour
to give her time to con&s;ider, which was granted for &s;ome few days.
At the end whereof &s;he &s;hut her &s;elf up in a Room with her Children;
and after &s;he had delivered a Paper to one of her Servants to carry to the
Emperour, &s;he &s;et the Chamber a Fire, and burnt both her &s;elf and her
Children. The Emperour met with nothing el&s;e in the Paper but
reproaches of his Tyranny, and atte&s;tations of joy from the Lady, that
&s;he had the opportunity to Sacrifice her &s;elf to the memory of her Hu&s;|band.
Several other &s;tories I have heard, which make me believe,
that this Nation is not uncapable of doing actions worthy a <HI>Roman</HI>
Vertue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were the fir&s;t people of <HI>Europe</HI> that di&s;cover'd the I&s;lands
of <HI>Japon.</HI> They were thrown upon the Coa&s;t by a violent Storm, in
the year 1542, and under&s;tanding that there was great &s;tore of Gold
and Silver in the Country, they return'd with a re&s;olution to &s;ettle them|&s;elves.
The fir&s;t place where they thought to fix was neer <HI>Surunga,</HI> a
City which &s;tands about four Leagues from the Sea: But becau&s;e there
is but one Road, and that not very &s;ecure neither for Shipping, they
remain'd there not above five years. At length they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
a little for&s;aken I&s;land call'd <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> which they peopl'd afterward's;
but &s;ince the la&s;t Per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were forc'd
to abandon it, having no more Commerce with the <HI>Japonners.</HI> How the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> came to erect their Factories there, I &s;hall tell the Reader in
another part of this Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="70">
Seven years after the fir&s;t coming of the <HI>Portugals</HI> to <HI>Japon,</HI> St. <HI>Francis
Xavier</HI> made a Voyage thither to Preach the Go&s;pel. The fir&s;t place where
he Landed was the I&s;land of <HI>Niphon,</HI> where he &s;tay'd two years and &s;ome
Months, and travel'd &s;everal parts of the&s;e I&s;lands; but his principal
de&s;ign being to go to <HI>China,</HI> he took &s;hipping accordingly. The Ve&s;&s;el
was no &s;ooner out at Sea, but St. <HI>Francis</HI> fell &s;ick, &s;o that the Captain
put him a&s;hore again in the I&s;land of <HI>Sechen,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Haynan,</HI>
belonging to <HI>China,</HI> where in a few days after he dy'd, and never was
in <HI>China,</HI> as &s;ome have reported and believ'd.</P>
<P>After his death the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;pread it &s;elf very much in
<HI>China,</HI> the people being very docible, and apprehen&s;ive of the in&s;tructions
which were given them, but the behaviour of the <HI>Portugals</HI> di&s;plea&s;ing
the Principal Governours, and tho&s;e who had mo&s;t Power at Court,
they did them ill Offices to the Emperour, and the <HI>Bonzes</HI> mi&s;liking the
new Religion, and jealous of the effects thereof, were the fomenters of
continual per&s;ecutions again&s;t the new Converts, pretending they
favour'd the de&s;igns of the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Chri&s;tian Religion daily got footing, and perhaps the
whole Nation would have embrac'd it, if the covetou&s;ne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s
of the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves had not been the chief impediment
of their conver&s;ion. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> did all they could to lay the fault
upon the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but the truth will ea&s;ily appear by the Letter written
to one <HI>Leonard Campen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> wherein it is &s;aid, that when the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> were ask'd by the Natives what Religion they were of, they
made this an&s;wer, <HI>We are no Chri&s;tians, we are</HI> Hollanders. I do not go
about to blemi&s;h a whole Nation for the fault of a few, but only to
&s;hew what a dangerous thing it is, to make an ill choice of Officers upon
the &s;etling of a new Commerce in Regions &s;o remote.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company having &s;et out a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Batavia,</HI>
put aboard about a dozen young Boys, and as many Girls, taken out of
the Ho&s;pitals in the Country. Among the&s;e Boys there was one who
was de&s;ign'd to &s;erve in the Kitchin, but Fortune made him an In&s;tru|ment
of one of the greate&s;t Misfortunes that ever befell our Age.
During the Voyage, the Merchant having ob&s;erv'd him to be a Boy of
a ready wit, and for that rea&s;on believing that he might one day prove &s;er|viceable
to the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, caus'd him to be taught to write and
read; wherein he improv'd &s;o well in a &s;hort time, that being come to
<HI>Batavia,</HI> he was thought capable of a higher Employment. The Ve&s;&s;el
being arriv'd, the General and his Council re&s;olv'd to &s;end the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el
to <HI>Japon,</HI> with &s;ome part of the Lading which was brought from <HI>Europe.</HI>
Thereupon the Merchant was commanded upon this Voyage, and the
under Accomptant happening in the mean time to dye, this Boy was by
him advanc'd to the place, and by the Merchant carefully in&s;tructed in
the knowledge of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el being arriv'd at Firanda, the new under Accomptant
believing no place more proper for him them that to rai&s;e his fortune,
re&s;olv'd to leave his Benefactor, and therefore when the Ship was to
return, he hid him&s;elf out of the way, till he knew the Ship to be far
enough on word on her Voyage, and by that means becoming a Member
of the Factory, he grew &s;o perfect in the Language of the Natives,
and &s;o u&s;eful to the Company, that do length. He came to be Pre&s;ident
of the Factory; the Authority of which Employment &s;o puff'd him
<PB N="6" REF="71">
up, that he was not only for continuing and upholding the Commerce
of his own, but excluding all other Nations. Now, as I have already
ob&s;erv'd, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were the fir&s;t Traders, and the fir&s;t that propa|gated
the Chri&s;tian Religion in tho&s;e parts; therefore it was that the
Chri&s;tian <HI>Japonners</HI> would not Trade with any but the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as
having known them longer, and finding them more true to their words.
This the Pre&s;ident ob&s;erv'd, and made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to render them
obnoxious at Court, and by vertue of his Pre&s;ents, engag'd the Gover|nours
of Provinces, and other great Lords, to favour his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Portugals</HI> wanted neither friends nor confederates. And
though they were not in a condition to be &s;o liberal as the Pre&s;ident, yet
they made a&s;hift to defend them&s;elves, and render his under hand
Dealings ineffectual. Thereupon finding that tho&s;e Tricks would
not take, he had recour&s;e to the foule&s;t of Calumnies; for he counter|feited
a Letter written in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, containing a di&s;co|very
of a de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Japonners</HI> to have made a general In|&s;urrection,
and a particular Con&s;piracy again&s;t the per&s;on of the Em|perour.
This Letter he carry'd to a Lord of the Country, into who&s;e
favour and confidence he had wrought him&s;elf, who pre&s;ently thought
it to be his duty to give intelligence of &s;o important a de&s;ign to the
Court.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident inform'd him by what accident the Letter came to his
hands, and gave an account of &s;uch circum&s;tances, as made his Impo|&s;ture
look with a probable countenance, relating, how that the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
had taken a <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;el returning from <HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> and that
the <HI>Holland</HI> Captain having taken this Letter among other Papers, open'd
it, and perceiving of what con&s;equence it was, had &s;ent an Expre&s;s to
the Pre&s;ident to proceed as his prudence, and the affection of the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Company toward the Emperour &s;hould guide him. That the <HI>Portugals,</HI>
who were but Subjects to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had a pernicious Maxim, not to
&s;uffer any Religon but their own in any place where they had to do,
and that for their own ends they never &s;par'd either the Life or Liberty
of Man; that they thought it an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to cut the
Throats of tho&s;e whom they could not convert. And la&s;tly, that the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> were a people that accorded with all Nations and Religions,
and minded nothing but their Trade.</P>
<P>The Lord believ'd all the&s;e fraudulent Calumnies, and &s;ent a Copy
of the Letter to the Emperour, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof was, That the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> being in
confederacy with the Chri&s;tians of the Country, had &s;ent to the Gover|nour
of <HI>Goa</HI> to &s;end by a time prefix'd eight or ten Ve&s;&s;els, with Men
and Arms, but e&s;pecially a good number of Officers to command the
Revolters, for that then there would be a numerous Army ready, and
that they &s;hould ea&s;ily make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were then under the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and
though they would &s;uffer no <HI>Spaniard</HI> in their <HI>Indian</HI> Acqui&s;itions but
the Viceroy, yet &s;everal of the Religious Orders did &s;lip into <HI>Japon;</HI>
carried thither by a true and real zeal; yet this zeal, when once indi&s;|creet,
does as much mi&s;chief as covetou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf. The Father <HI>Pau|li&s;ts,</HI>
for &s;o they call the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by rea&s;on that their Church
in <HI>Goa</HI> is dedicated to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> the&s;e <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> I &s;ay, had made a fair pro|gre&s;s,
and gain'd great credit among the people, notwhith&s;tanding
<PB N="7" REF="71">
their continual per&s;ecutions, according as the Lords of the Country
were well or ill affected towards them. Their number therefore
encreas'd, and the new Converts had this advantage, that they enrich'd
them&s;elves by Trading with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who had made a po&s;itive
Agreement not to Trade with the <HI>Bonzes.</HI> This provok'd the <HI>Bonzes</HI>
again&s;t them, and the multitude of the Chri&s;tians &s;o far augmented
the Emperour's jealou&s;ies and fears, that in a &s;hort time they produc'd
the effects of open rage and cruelty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had converted to the Faith a great Lord of the Kingdom,
who liv'd mo&s;t commonly at <HI>Bugen,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Ximo,</HI> a per&s;on of
great Intere&s;t and Power in the I&s;land. He had four Sons, two of
which liv'd with him, and following his Example, had embrac'd the
Catholick Faith. The Father was Baptiz'd by the name of <HI>Ignatius;</HI>
the elde&s;t of the two was call'd <HI>Francis,</HI> and the younge&s;t <HI>Charles:</HI> the
two elde&s;t Sons were at Court in great favour with the Emperour. The
younger of the two that had embrac'd the Chri&s;tian Religion, ad|dicted
him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of the Scripture, and retir'd with
the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> to their Seminary. His Example had wrought with a great
number of young Lords, and as he was eloquent be&s;ides, he was of
great u&s;e to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in preaching the Go&s;pel, and reclaiming the people
from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their Errors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are naturally endow'd with a noble mind, and great
inclination to Learning; &s;o that there is nothing wanting in that Nation
but able Teachers. Not but that they have Doctors of their own: the
<HI>Dairy</HI>'s Court is full of them; where they pre&s;erve the Annals of their
Country, and pretend that Printing and Artillery were in u&s;e among
them before they were known in <HI>Europe.</HI> From this Court come all
their Books, in regard the per&s;ons that attend upon this Prince apply
them&s;elves only to their Studies. It is reported, that they learnt all the&s;e
things by their frequent Commerce with the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and that they are
al&s;o originally de&s;cended from them. And in truth, the greate&s;t Pro|vince
of the I&s;land of <HI>Niphon</HI> is call'd <HI>Quanto,</HI> according to the name
of the Sea-Coa&s;t part of <HI>China,</HI> where lies the greate&s;t Traffick be|tween
the <HI>Japonners</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> Moreover, if there be any credit to
be given to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tories, they &s;ay it was but a &s;mall part of their
va&s;t-Empire, which extended it &s;elf from North to South 56 Degrees
of Latitude, from the Frozen Sea to the Equinoctial Line, being boun|ded
to the We&s;t by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and extending Ea&s;tward over all
the Southern <HI>America</HI> to <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Thomas Barr,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> has often told me when I was at
<HI>Agra,</HI> a capital City of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have a very
fair Hou&s;e, that this and &s;everal other young Lords improv'd
them&s;elves &s;o far in &s;ix or &s;even years, that they were as Learned as their
Ma&s;ters them&s;elves, and that they were more zealous in converting
tho&s;e of their Nation. Now the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at that time had no Hou&s;e for
the In&s;truction of Youth and Pro&s;elytes, and therefore they de&s;ir'd this
young Lord to lend them one of his. Thereupon he having four very
fair ones, with great Revenues belonging to them, gave that which
was neare&s;t to the City to his Converters. A while after, the younge&s;t
of his Sons fell &s;ick, and was carried to this Hou&s;e for the Air's &s;ake,
where he recover'd by the care of the Fathers, and the Prayers of the
Chri&s;tians; but his Father did not long enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;o great
<PB N="8" REF="72">
a Cure, which &s;eem'd almo&s;t miraculous; for he dy'd at what time both
his Sons and the Chri&s;tians &s;tood mo&s;t in need of his protection.</P>
<P>The two elde&s;t, who were with the Emperour, under&s;tanding the
the Death of their Father, came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Inheritance,
and demanded of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> the Hou&s;e which their Father had given
them, for in <HI>Japon</HI> no Parent can alienate the E&s;tate of his Children;
nay, when they come to &s;uch an Age, he is oblig'd to put them in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their E&s;tates, re&s;erving only &s;uch a proportion to him&s;elf.
The <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> loth to part with &s;o fair a convenience, would not quit their
hold, though it were for their own quiet, and to engage the whole
Family to &s;tand by them in their time of trouble. This refu&s;al pro|vok'd
the two Brethren, and this quarrel between them and the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>
happen'd at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident was labouring to
bring about his de&s;igns. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">d notice of this di&s;pute, and as he was
a great Impo&s;tor, he made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word"> his bu&s;ine&s;s to enflame the two Brothers,
not only again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> but again&s;t the <HI>Portugals</HI> in general, giving
them a Copy of the Letter which he had fram'd, as is before-men|tion'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Lords, who were Favourites of the Emperour, joyning
Intere&s;t of State to their particular Intere&s;t, made their complaints at
Court, with extraordinary aggravations; urging that there was no
&s;ecurity for the E&s;tates of particular Men, for the quiet of the Empire,
nor the Life of the Prince, unle&s;s not only all the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but al&s;o all
the Natives of <HI>Japon,</HI> who had &s;uck'd their Errors, were exterminated
out of the I&s;land. To make good the rea&s;ons of their Exa&s;peration they
&s;hew'd the Emperour a Copy of the Letter, and put him into &s;uch
a fright, as well for his Per&s;on, as the Empire, that he would admit of
no ju&s;tification on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Some of his Lords, who were Friends to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> be&s;ought him
to examin the truth of what was alledg'd, before he proceeded to utmo&s;t
extremities again&s;t a whole Nation, and again&s;t his own Subjects.
But he was inexorable, and pre&s;ently gave private Orders to certain
Commi&s;&s;ioners, to go through all the Provinces of the Empire, and
to bani&s;h not only the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but al&s;o all the Chri&s;tian Natives. Now
in regard they had their private confederates, as well in the Court, as
in other places, they had intelligence, in all parts, of the cruel re&s;olution
tak'n again&s;t them, though none were more zealous and faithful to
them then the two Lords of <HI>Ximo, Francis</HI> and <HI>Charles.</HI> Thereupon
the Chri&s;tians met together to con&s;ult for their own &s;afety, and their
common pre&s;ervation, and &s;eeing all attempts to ju&s;tifie them&s;elves
prove ineffectual, they re&s;olv'd to &s;tand upon their guards, and to dye
in the defence of their Innocency and Religion. The two Lords put
them&s;elves at the head of the Chri&s;tians Army, the elder of which had
been a Souldier, and under&s;tood the Art of War; the younger kept up
their Spirits and Courages by his continual Exhortations.</P>
<P>The Emperour's Commi&s;&s;ioners under&s;tanding that the Chri&s;tians
were thus embody'd, gave him &s;peedy notice thereof, but &s;aid nothing
either of the number of their Forces, or of their de&s;igns. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>
and <HI>Au&s;tin Fryars</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, that the Army of the Chri&s;tians con|&s;i&s;ted
of above 40000 Men, be&s;ides tho&s;e recruits that came up to them
before and after the Battel was fought.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="72">
The Emperour not beleiving that the Army was &s;o numerous, &s;ent
again&s;t them at fir&s;t not above 25 or 30000 Men, under the Com|mand
of the younge&s;t of the two Lords of <HI>Ximo,</HI> that liv'd at
Court. But tho&s;e Troops were no &s;ooner upon their March, but
he rais'd new Forces, and &s;ent another Army after them, con&s;i&s;ting of
40000 Men, commanded by the young Lord, to whom the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Pre&s;ident had &s;hew'd the Letter fir&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians having intelligence of the approach of the&s;e two
Armies, prepar'd to receive them, choo&s;ing an advantagious place to
intrench them&s;elves. The fir&s;t Army &s;oon appear'd in &s;ight of the
Chri&s;tians, who lay &s;o encamp'd, that the Imperiali&s;ts could di&s;cover
no more than one part of them. However, before the Engagement,
the younge&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Brothers advis'd his other Brother to &s;end to
the General of the Emperour's Army, who was their Brother likewi&s;e, to
de&s;ire Peace, and to be&s;eech him to intercede for them to the Emperour,
and to a&s;&s;ure him, that they were ready to lay down their Arms, and
throw them&s;elves at his Feet, and to ju&s;tifie their Innocency. To this
purpo&s;e a Letter was fram'd and &s;ent to the General, but the Me&s;&s;enger
that carry'd it was nail'd to a Cro&s;s in &s;ight of the whole Army of the
Chri&s;tians, and at the &s;ame time the Enemy came on with great fury to
a&s;&s;ail them.</P>
<P>The Fight la&s;ted almo&s;t three hours with equal advantage; the Cap|tain
of the Imperiali&s;ts &s;eeking every where for his Brothers, while they
&s;trove to avoid him. The Chri&s;tians, who knew that all their &s;afety
con&s;i&s;ted in their Victory, and that there was otherwi&s;e no hope of par|don,
fought with &s;o much valour; that the Imperiali&s;ts were forc'd to
give ground. Their General was &s;lain upon the place, and at length
the whole Army of the Idolaters was cut in pieces.</P>
<P>This Victory wrought the Conver&s;ion of &s;everal of the Idolaters;
and the Chri&s;tians, after they had given thanks to God three days toge|ther,
prepar'd them&s;elves for a &s;econd Combat, not doubting but the
other Army would &s;et upon them while they were weary, and weaken'd
by the la&s;t Battel. But that General more prudent then the former, only
po&s;ted him&s;elf where the Chri&s;tians could not come at him, and writ
to the Court the particulars of the Defeat of the fir&s;t Army, upon which
he expected the Emperour's Orders.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Army of the Chri&s;tians daily encreas'd, &s;o that
in a few days they were above fifty thou&s;and &s;trong. The Emperour,
re&s;olv'd to &s;tifle this Revolt in the beginning, &s;ent Orders through all
his Empire to make new Levies; and all the while the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident's
Confederates ceas'd not to aggravate him again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, not
&s;uffering the other Courtiers to open his Eyes, and prevent &s;o unju&s;t a
pro&s;ecution. The defeat of his Army had put him into &s;uch a rage be|&s;ides,
that though the Captains of the Chri&s;tians Army did all they
could to clear them&s;elves from the fal&s;e accu&s;ations laid upon them, and
to obtain their pardons, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of being heard.</P>
<P>The Emperour call'd his Council, where the wi&s;e&s;t were of opinion,
that it would prove the be&s;t way to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of the Chri|&s;tians,
who offer'd to lay down their Arms upon a general pardon, and
the free exerci&s;e of their Religion. But the Pre&s;ident's Cabal carry'd it
beyond this &s;ober advice, and the Emperour, exa&s;perated by his Impo|&s;tures,
took the wrong cour&s;e. Thereupon the Council re&s;olv'd with
<PB N="10" REF="73">
all &s;peed to rai&s;e a va&s;t Army, which was to joyn with the other, and
&s;o to ruin the Chri&s;tians all at a blow. The <HI>Dairy</HI> al&s;o, who is con|&s;ulted
upon all important affairs, approv'd this Council. Thereupon
the Lords who are oblig'd to furni&s;h the Emperour with Men, &s;trove
who &s;hould bring their Troops and Companies fir&s;t to the Randevouz
appointed, which was neer the place where the &s;econd Army lay; &s;o
that when both Armies were joyn'd together, there was in the Field a
Body of 150000 Men. The Brother of the General, who was &s;lain in
the fir&s;t Battel, commanded under the Emperour, who re&s;olv'd to go
in per&s;on.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t of all he caus'd a Proclamation to be made in his Camp,
whereby he forbad any Quarter to be given to any Chri&s;tian, unle&s;s it
were the two Brothers, whom he intended to puni&s;h openly; and that
they who left the Field before the Chri&s;tians were bani&s;h'd, &s;hould be put,
they and their Kindred, to the mo&s;t cruel Deaths that could be imagin'd;
but that they &s;hould be rewarded that brought the Head of a Chri&s;tian
to the Emperour. The Copies of this Proclamation were &s;catter'd in
the Army of the Chri&s;tians, though they did no harm but only encou|rag'd
them again&s;t the Idolaters, &s;eeing there was no hope of pardon.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the younge&s;t of the two Brothers offer'd to go and throw
him&s;elf at the Emperour's Feet, to implore his clemency in the name of
the whole Army; &s;aying withall, That he &s;hould accompt him&s;elf happy
to &s;uffer Martyrdom to &s;hew his Innocency; but they would not &s;uffer
him to &s;tir. All he could obtain from them, was to write a Letter full
of re&s;pect, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and repentance for what had been already done,
declaring that they were ready to lay down their Arms, if the Emperour
would grant them pardon, and the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion,
offering with the hazard of their Lives to make out the fal&s;ity of all
tho&s;e things wherewith they had been accus'd.</P>
<P>This was by an Idolater carry'd to a certain Lord who &s;ecretly favour'd
the Chri&s;tians; but the Emperour toar it without reading it, vowing
at the &s;ame time, that he would never return to his Court 'till the Idola|ters
were all extirpated. The Chri&s;tian Army under&s;tanding the Em|perour's
re&s;olution, minded nothing more then their own defence. 'Tis
true, the Ground where they lay was advantagious enough for the
&s;mallne&s;s of their Number, but the Idolaters were three to one; be&s;ides
that the Idolaters of the Country, who favour'd the Chri&s;tians before,
now declar'd all again&s;t them &s;o &s;oon as they &s;aw the Imperial Army.
So that now both Armies lying &s;o near together, &s;everal hot Skirmi&s;hes
pa&s;s'd between 'em; and at length it came to a general Battel. At fir&s;t
the Chri&s;tians overthrew the Idolaters, not able to &s;tand before them:
with &s;o much vigour did the younge&s;t of their Chieftains a&s;&s;ail them.
He was remarkable for his Habit that day, but more remarkable for his
courage; &s;o that the Field was cover'd with the Bodies of the &s;lain, fear
and dread po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the yielding Enemy. But while the Victor forgot his
Brother's advice, and pur&s;u'd too far from the Body of the Army, he
was encompa&s;s'd on every &s;ide, wounded, and being carried away by
the pre&s;s of his Enemies, was at length taken, and lead before the
Emperour. His elde&s;t Brother, more experienc'd in War, rally'd and
recall'd tho&s;e that had follow'd his Brother, and till Night maintain'd
the advantages, which he had got over the Imperiali&s;ts, who were &s;till
&s;upply'd with fre&s;h Succours, as nece&s;&s;ity requir'd. The next day the Fight
<PB N="11" REF="73">
was renew'd again by break of day, and with a &s;ucce&s;s as honourable,
but more bloody to the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The third day the Emperour enrag'd at &s;uch a re&s;i&s;tance, caus'd them
to be &s;et upon in &s;everal places at one time. The General of the Chri|&s;tians
Army rode from Rank to Rank, encouraging the Souldiers both
by his Exhortations, and his Example: but at length having receiv'd
&s;everal wounds, he was overlaid by the multitude of his Enemies that
crouded to his de&s;truction. And now the General being lo&s;t, and the
Chri&s;tians having no per&s;on to command them, it ceas'd to be a Com|bat,
and became a Ma&s;&s;acre. However, re&s;olving to dye with their
Swords in their hands, they flung them&s;elves into the thicke&s;t of their
Enemies, and Sacrific'd them&s;elves to their own Innocency. Their
Camp was &s;oon forc'd, and all the old Men, Women, and Children
put to the Sword, except &s;ome few that e&s;cap'd and hid them&s;elves in
the Mountains, who afterwards made a relation of this bloody Story to
them who rehears'd it to me.</P>
<P>This was the deplorable end of the Chri&s;tians, and indeed of the
Chri&s;tiani&s;me of <HI>Japon,</HI> which the Pre&s;ident procur'd by his impo&s;tures
and fallacies. And it has been made appear by three exact accompts, that
there has peri&s;h'd, either in Battels or by Tortures, above 60000 Chri|&s;tians.
The elde&s;t of their Captains &s;uffer'd a mo&s;t cruel Martyrdom
for &s;even days, neither could any offer, that the Emperour could make
him for his Brothers and his own Valours &s;ake, induce him to renounce
the Chri&s;tian Faith. After that, there was a kind of Inqui&s;ition &s;et up
thorough the whole Empire, which la&s;ted for &s;everal years, whereby
tho&s;e that per&s;ever'd in the Faith, were condemn'd to mo&s;t intolerable
Torments, in &s;o much that the Relation which <HI>Van Varen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI>
who&s;e credit it would be a vanity to que&s;tion in this particular, cannot
be read over without Horrour. In &s;ixteen years, that is, from 1613
to 1629, the Chri&s;tians were &s;o multiply'd, that there were above
400000; but in the year 1649, the &s;ame <HI>Hollander</HI> relates, that tho&s;e
<HI>Japonners</HI> who were brought from thence by the Company's Ships to <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI>
affirm'd, that Chri&s;tianity was utterly extirpated out of the
I&s;land.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Ogli,</HI> a large Town upon the faire&s;t Arm of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> I
met a <HI>Holland</HI> Merchant, who had &s;erv'd the Company in <HI>Japon</HI> a long
time and had made &s;everal Voyages. He came thither with two
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word"> laden with Bars of Silver and Copper, which he had exchang'd
for Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy at <HI>Bengale.</HI> This Merchant know|ing
I was there, came to vi&s;it me; and I finding him to be a &s;incere
hone&s;t Man, and well ver&s;t in the affairs of <HI>Japan,</HI> e&s;pecially in
reference to the la&s;t per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians, grew cove|tous
of his conver&s;e, and invited him often to my Hou&s;e. In our
familiar di&s;cour&s;es concerning the &s;ettlement of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and of the extraordinary gain which they make by their
Trade there, and pa&s;&s;ing thus from one thing to another, at length I ask'd
him who was the Author and Contriver of a Ma&s;&s;acre &s;o horrid, as
that was reported to be. Whereupon he related to me all the particu|lars
of which I have here made a recital, and many more which I have
forgot or omitted, as being either not pertinent to my &s;ubject, or el&s;e
already related by others. He had his information from &s;uch of the
Natives that had e&s;cap'd out of the Battel, and &s;everal of the Idolater
<PB N="12" REF="74">
Merchants, in who&s;e memories the fact was then fre&s;h: and indeed he
was &s;o ingenious in his Story, that I could not find any motive to in|cite
me to mi&s;doubt the truth of it. For many times he could not for|bear
&s;hedding tears, and to interrupt his di&s;cour&s;e with his &s;ighs, often
imprecating Heav'ns Vengeance upon the Pre&s;ident, and prote&s;ting
he wonder'd the Company employ'd him &s;o long. But God re&s;erv'd
his puni&s;hment to him&s;elf. For the de&s;erts of his crimes always atten|ding
him, and provoking judgments and misfortunes upon whatever
Enterprize he took in hand, he mi&s;erably peri&s;h'd in &s;ight of <HI>Lisbon</HI> in
fair weather. All the men in the Ship were &s;av'd; only he returning
to recover a certain Cabinet of Jewels which he had there, the Ship
&s;plit, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him &s;wallow'd up in the
Sea, who had been the occa&s;ion of the Ruin of &s;o many of their
Country-men in <HI>Japon;</HI> and immediately they rang their Bells in the
City for joy of his Death.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> I was at <HI>Bandar-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> where the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> have a Factory. Thither arriv'd two Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Japon</HI> to
take in Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to exchange in
<HI>Japon.</HI> The Captain of one of the Ships told me, that during &s;everal
trading Voyages which he had made to that I&s;land, the Emperour had
caus'd two Inqui&s;itions to be made after the Chri&s;tians; in the fir&s;t of
which the Inqui&s;itors met with 247, who were all mo&s;t exqui&s;itely
tormented to Death; in the latter they only found 63, among whom
were &s;eventeen Children, twelve Girls and five Boys, of which the
elde&s;t were not above thirteen years of Age.</P>
<P>Among all the per&s;ecutions which the Chri&s;tians &s;uffer'd, there was
none comparable to this for extremity of Torments: For the <HI>Japonners</HI>
are the mo&s;t ingenious in cruelty of any people in the World, and the
mo&s;t con&s;tant in &s;uffering. For there have been Children from ten to
a dozen years old, who for 60 days together have endur'd to have their
Bodies fa&s;ten'd to the Cro&s;s, half burnt, half torn in pieces, while
their Executioners forc'd them to eat, on purpo&s;e to prolong their Lives
in mi&s;ery; and yet they would not renounce the Faith which they had
embrac'd. Neither did this barbarous Inqui&s;ition extend only to the
Chri&s;tians, but to their Kindred and Relations, nay, to their very
Neighbours. For if a Prie&s;t were taken in any Hou&s;e, all the people
in that Hou&s;e, and the Hou&s;es adjoyning, were hall'd to Execution,
for not having made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>At the beginning of every year there is a new Inqui&s;ition, at which
time all that can write are requir'd to &s;ub&s;cribe, or el&s;e the chief of the
Family &s;ub&s;cribes for all the re&s;t, that they neither are Chri&s;tians, nor
are acquainted with any Chri&s;tians, and that they abominate Chri&s;tianity
as a Religion dangerous to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Braganza,</HI> being advanc'd to the Crown, that &s;udden
change which in one day, and without the lea&s;t Tumult in <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
wre&s;ted the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> wrought the
&s;ame effect at <HI>Goa.</HI> All the <HI>Portugals</HI> at <HI>Goa</HI> at the &s;ame time acknow|ledg'd
their new Soveraign; the Viceroy who was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was &s;ent
away to <HI>Spain</HI> by the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;els that were homeward bound; and <HI>Don
Philip de Ma&s;carennas,</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> Governour of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> came to <HI>Goa,</HI> and
took upon him the command of Viceroy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="74">
So &s;oon as he came to the Government, his fir&s;t thoughts were how
to E&s;tabli&s;h the Trade of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> which when they were
expell'd, amounted to three Millions of <HI>Pardo's</HI> yearly, one <HI>Pardo</HI> being
worth twenty &s;even <HI>Sous</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. The hopes therefore of
regaining &s;o great a lo&s;s, made him toward the end of the year 1642,
take a re&s;olution to &s;end a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y to the Emperour of <HI>Japon,</HI> fur|ni&s;h'd
with magnificent Pre&s;ents: For which rea&s;on he made choice of
what was mo&s;t rare, and mo&s;t likely to be acceptable to the Emperour,
and the Grandees of his Court. The mo&s;t co&s;tly of the&s;e Pre&s;ents was
a piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Wood of Calambour,</HI> four Foot
in length, and two Foot in Diameter; a larger piece then which the
<HI>Indies</HI> had never &s;een, having co&s;t 40000 <HI>Parao's.</HI> To this he added a
great quantity of fair Coral Beads of an extraordinary bigne&s;s. This is
the mo&s;t acceptable Pre&s;ent that can be &s;ent to the Lords of <HI>Japon,</HI> which
they fa&s;ten to the Strings wherewith they draw their Pouches together.
With the&s;e he &s;ent a great number of Carpets and Hangings of Cloth
of Gold, Silver, and Silk, and &s;everal pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and
Silver. 'Tis &s;aid the whole Pre&s;ent co&s;t the City of <HI>Goa</HI> above eight
hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pardo's,</HI> which amounts to about 86666 <HI>l. 13 s.
4 d.</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money. Be&s;ides all this, the two great Ships which
were prepar'd for the Emba&s;&s;ador, carry'd one of them 50 Peeces of
Canon, and the other 35, both laden with all &s;orts of Commodities
which are e&s;teem'd and priz'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> amounting to about 83333 <HI>l. 6 s.
8 d.</HI> Sterling. The Equipage of the Emba&s;&s;ador was no le&s;s &s;umptuous.
And becau&s;e the Viceroy would not be thought to give any occa&s;ion of
offence to the Emperour, he would not &s;uffer one <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> in the Train,
but only four <HI>Augu&s;tins</HI> for the Admiral, and four <HI>Jacobins</HI> for the other,
Men of di&s;cretion and conduct. While I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> in the year 1648,
I met with &s;ome of the&s;e Fathers, who gave an exact accompt of the
Emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>They made a pro&s;perous Voyage, and arriv'd happily at their in|tended
Port. But you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that when any Ship arrives at
<HI>Japon,</HI> no per&s;ons are permitted to come a&s;hore, 'till the Governour of
the place have an accompt who they are, that they may give notice
thereof to the Emperour, and know his plea&s;ure, whether they &s;hall be
received or no. In the mean time the Ships rode in a very dangerous
place, at the entry of the Haven, into which there was no &s;teering,
without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Native Pilots.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Nanga&s;aqui</HI> &s;urpriz'd to under&s;tand that they were
<HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> wrote in all ha&s;t to the Emperour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident
being inform'd of the news, play'd all the pranks he could, us'd all the
contrivances imaginable to fru&s;trate the &s;ucce&s;s of the Emba&s;&s;y, and
to ruine the Ve&s;&s;els that brought the Emba&s;&s;adour and his Pre&s;ents.
To which purpo&s;e he found a way to bribe the Courrier, who was &s;ent
with the Emperours Orders; &s;o that in&s;tead of twenty days, which
were &s;ufficient for his journey, he made it above two Months before he
deliver'd his di&s;patches. During which time the two Ships had &s;uffer'd
very bad weather upon the Coa&s;ts, and endur'd many a &s;evere Storm.
At length the Orders came that none &s;hould be permitted to Land but
the Emba&s;&s;adour, the two Captains, and the two Pilots, to give an
accompt of the &s;ubject and cau&s;e of their coming. The Emba&s;&s;adour
being Landed, acquainted the Governour that he came to compliment
<PB N="14" REF="75">
the Emperour in the behalf of the King his Ma&s;ter, and to a&s;&s;ure him
that they were no longer under the Power of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That
about a year &s;ince, a lawful Heir of <HI>Portugal</HI> had recover'd the Diadem
of his Ance&s;tors which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had u&s;urp'd. That this new King
was &s;o ju&s;t and generous a Prince, that under&s;tanding that &s;ome of his
Subjects had de&s;erted the I&s;land of <HI>Japon,</HI> without paying their Debts,
he had now &s;ent to make a general &s;atisfaction; but chiefly out of that
re&s;pect which obliges all Soveraigns newly come to the Crown, to give
notice thereof to tho&s;e Princes, who&s;e friend&s;hip they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Governour inform'd the Emperour of all the&s;e things; but the
Pre&s;ident having as good intelligence by means of his Friends at Court,
alledg'd to the Emperour that they were Rebels, who came from the
utmo&s;t parts of the We&s;t, to bring the News and Example of their
Revolt to <HI>Japon:</HI> That the natural re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of this Nation caus'd fre|quent
di&s;turbances and revolutions among them. That they were never
long at re&s;t them&s;elves, nor would &s;uffer others to be at quiet. That
con&s;idering the experience he had had, he could not be either too cau|tious
for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, or the tranquillity of his Empire.
La&s;tly, that the Emperour and the Empire would be ruin'd pa&s;t reco|very,
if tho&s;e people were ever admitted to &s;et footing therein.</P>
<P>This Coun&s;el well &s;econded by the re&s;t of the Cabal, ea&s;ily made an
impre&s;&s;ion in the Heart of the Prince naturally Barbarous, and an
Enemy to the Chri&s;tians. Thereupon he &s;ent an Order to the Gover|nour
to invite all the <HI>Whites</HI> aboard, and to treat them for eight days in
the be&s;t manner he could. At the end of eight days they were order'd
to repair aboard again, and at the &s;ame time he made a Pre&s;ent to the
Emba&s;&s;adour, and chief of his Train, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix great Cabinets,
and &s;ix Coffers lacker'd with black, with Figures in Relief, intermix'd
with &s;pangles of Gold, all the Embelli&s;hments being of Ma&s;&s;ie Gold.
With them were &s;ix Cabinets, and &s;ix Coffers, lacker'd with Red,
Embelli&s;h'd after the &s;ame manner with Silver. I &s;aw &s;ome of them
when I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never beheld any &s;o rare and
beautiful in that kind, which made me admire the ingenious Indu&s;try
of the Arti&s;ts of <HI>Japon;</HI> Our <HI>European</HI> imitations of their workman&s;hip
being no way comparable to them.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;adour having receiv'd his Pre&s;ent, had Order to remove
all the Goods in the &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el into the Admiral. He would have
made great Pre&s;ents to the Governour, who refus'd them; telling the
Emba&s;&s;adour withall, that he had expre&s;s command to refu&s;e them, and
to declare to the Emba&s;&s;adour, that if he did not make ha&s;t away, he
would &s;ink his Ship. That the Emperour his Ma&s;ter had made a new
prohibition, forbidding all <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> to venture near his
Dominions upon any pretence what&s;oever; nay, though it were upon
pretence of an Emba&s;&s;y, upon pain of being crucifi'd upon the place,
without liberty to &s;peak for them&s;elves. As for the Debts of the <HI>Portu|gals,</HI>
he had undertaken to di&s;charge them him&s;elf; only he had &s;ent
that Pre&s;ent to the King his Ma&s;ter to thank him for that Emba&s;&s;y. The
Emba&s;&s;adour had no &s;ooner remov'd the Goods out of the &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el
into the Admiral, but they &s;ank her before his face. And not contented
with that affront, the Governour &s;ent for all the Blacks that were in the
Admiral, and cut off their Heads, pretending they were <HI>Indians,</HI> and
that, as &s;uch, they could not be ignorant of the Rigorous prohibitions
<PB N="15" REF="75">
which the Emperour had put forth, forbidding all Strangers, except the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> to &s;et footing in <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour was thus harbarou&s;ly fru&s;trated and
di&s;mi&s;s'd, he &s;ent News thereof to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> urging him
to execute the de&s;ign which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had upon <HI>Macao;</HI> telling him
al&s;o, That though there were a probability of a League between the
<HI>Hollander</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet that it could be no
harm to &s;eize <HI>Macao</HI> beforehand, as they had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters
of &s;everal places, while the <HI>Portugals</HI> were under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI>
The General taking the Pre&s;ident's advice, was ready to &s;et Sail upon
this enterprize, when a Me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Portugal</HI> brought him the News
of the Treaty concluded between <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> as al&s;o of the
Navy which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Lisbon</HI> to aid the <HI>Portugals.</HI> At
fir&s;t he made as if it had been a fal&s;e Rumour, and put the Me&s;&s;enger in
Pri&s;on; neverthele&s;s while he delay'd the departure of the Fleet, he
receiv'd expre&s;s Orders from his Superiours to Treat the <HI>Portugals</HI> as
Friends and Allies. So that he was con&s;train'd to turn all his Forces
again&s;t the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident was very &s;orry for the la&s;t News, by rea&s;on that the
General and he had great de&s;igns upon the Conque&s;t of that place, and
had promis'd the Company by that means to make them ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters
of the Trade of <HI>China,</HI> and of all the Ea&s;t. True it is, that <HI>Macao</HI> is
very advantagiou&s;ly &s;eated for tho&s;e that de&s;ign to be Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e
Seas, e&s;pecially upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Fockien,</HI> which are
the Provinces, whither are brought down all the Merchandizes of this
Empire. It lies at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Canton,</HI> in a &s;mall
<HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> adjoyning to a larger I&s;land, and built upon a kind of a Pro|montory,
on three &s;ides environ'd with the Sea, which no Ship can
come neer by rea&s;on of the Flats, unle&s;s it be on that &s;ide next the Port,
which is defended by a &s;trong Fortre&s;s. This City drew from the only
Fair of <HI>Quanchiu</HI> 1300 Che&s;ts of Silks of all &s;orts, every Che&s;t con|taining
150 pieces, and 2500 Lingots of Gold, not reckoning the raw
Silks, the Gold Wire, and other Merchandizes: whence it may be
ea&s;ily judg'd what advantage the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> made of it; and wherefore
the Pre&s;ident de&s;ir'd &s;o much to expell them from thence.</P>
<P>But his De&s;igns were di&s;appointed, not only by the revolution in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> but al&s;o by the lo&s;s which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd of the I&s;land
of <HI>Formo&s;ae,</HI> which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> took from them, following the advice
of a <HI>French</HI> Souldier, whom the Governour of <HI>Tayovan</HI> had refus'd to
di&s;mi&s;s after his time was out. For the better under&s;tanding this
accident, you mu&s;t know that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being &s;etl'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> and
having excluded all other Nations from thence, except the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
whom the Emperour permitted to return, after that the Ma&s;&s;acre com|mitted
by the <HI>Japonners</HI> in a City of <HI>China,</HI> of which they had a de&s;ire
to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, had caus'd a Ce&s;&s;ation of the Commerce
between the two Kingdoms, and con&s;train'd the Emperour of <HI>China</HI>
to &s;et a price upon the Heads of the <HI>Japonners.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI>
did all they could to make a new Rupture between the people, or
el&s;e them&s;elves to &s;eize upon &s;ome place that lay proper to ruin the Trade
of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, not daring to attempt upon the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> they
over-ran the Seas which environ'd the neighbouring I&s;lands, and took
<PB N="16" REF="76">
the Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> which were bound for <HI>Macao,</HI> exerci&s;ing
&s;trange Cruelties upon the people that had e&s;cap'd into tho&s;e I&s;lands,
after the irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into <HI>China. Coxinga,</HI> the Son of
<HI>Chinchilunge,</HI> that famous Pirate, who &s;av'd the remainders of that
ruin'd Empire, then commanded tho&s;e people, and was become formi|dable
to the <HI>Tartars</HI> them&s;elves. Who to revenge him&s;elf upon the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Pirates, undertook the Siege of <HI>Tayovan,</HI> where they u&s;ually
retir'd, and by gaining that place drave them wholly out of <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large I&s;land plac'd at the poynt of the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> &s;tretch|ing
out in length from North to South, and to the We&s;t lying oppo&s;ite
to the Provinces of <HI>Fockien,</HI> and <HI>Quantung.</HI> The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> call it <HI>Tali|eukieu.</HI>
Since which time, 'tis very probable that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave it
the name of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> from its beauty and fertility. They being the
fir&s;t people of <HI>Europe</HI> that di&s;cover'd it, and inhabited it; and upon one
of its Promontories to the North built the Fort of <HI>Kiling.</HI> The natu|ral
Inhabitants live almo&s;t all in the Woods and Mountains, where they
maintain them&s;elves by hunting the Hart, and wild Boar, who&s;e dry'd
Fle&s;h, Skins, and Horns they &s;ell to the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who in exchange
bring them other nece&s;&s;aries. The little I&s;land of <HI>Tayovan</HI> lent its Name
to the little Fort which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built, over again&s;t the great I&s;land;
it was very convenient for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who made great advantage
of the Cattel, Hides, and Horns, both of Harts and Bufalo's, which
they carry'd from thence, and &s;old to the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Japonners,</HI> who make
great u&s;e thereof in &s;everal of their Trades and Manufactures. But the
chiefe&s;t advantage which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made of this I&s;land con&s;i&s;ted in
this, that it lay in the middle way between <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> and
&s;erv'd as a place of &s;ecurity for their Ships in bad Sea&s;ons, and to take
in refre&s;hments. There al&s;o they laded off &s;everal of the Goods of the
<HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> which they took by way of Piracy from the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> or which
were brought them by the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who are the Original Merchants of
the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> &s;etled at the <HI>Philippines,</HI> but who drive the greate&s;t Trade
of that Country, independent from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coxinga,</HI> though an Idolater and a Pirate, bani&s;h'd out of his Country,
and provok'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had &s;o much humanity as to &s;end to the
General at <HI>Batavia</HI> to &s;end away Ve&s;&s;els to fetch away his Men, and de|liver'd
them all without &s;uffering them to receive the lea&s;t injury. He
had his Friends and Favourers in the Emperour of <HI>Japon</HI>'s Court, as
being a declar'd Enemy to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who&s;e neer Neighbourhood the
<HI>Japonners</HI> cannot endure. For &s;o quick a Conque&s;t of &s;o many Lands
and Provinces in &s;even years, as it were only upon &s;ight of the Enemy,
had very much alarum'd them. He by his Friends acquainted the Em|perour
of the acts of Ho&s;tility, committed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> again&s;t
the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchants: Adding moreover, that they had made private
propo&s;itions to league them&s;elves with the common Enemy; and that
it was one of the Nations of the North, born for the de&s;olation of other
Countries, and to invade the Peace of Empires. That they had &s;etled
them&s;elves in the I&s;lands of the Ea&s;t only by treachery and violence.
That for &s;ome years &s;ince, they had made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to crui&s;e the
Seas between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> on purpo&s;e to make them&s;elves ab&s;olute
Ma&s;ters of the Trade, and that if he did not take a &s;peedy cour&s;e, they
would do the &s;ame mi&s;chief in his Dominions which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had
done in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="76">
The Pre&s;ident had much ado to divert the Storm, for the mo&s;t potent
Lords at Court, although his Pen&s;ioners and Friends, began to open
their Eyes, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure took <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s part, &s;aying, That the
<HI>Chine&s;es</HI> were unfortunate enough, in being laid wa&s;t by the <HI>Tartars&punc;</HI>
without being per&s;ecuted and afflicted by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> That &s;eeing
that after they had been expell'd their Country, they had nothing left

a piece of inhumanity to di&s;turb them in their la&s;t Sanctuaries, and to
deprive them of their liberty of the Sea, and their Commerce with
<HI>Japon,</HI> from whence tho&s;e mi&s;erable Exiles had their chiefe&s;t &s;upport.
The <HI>Bonzes,</HI> the Merchants, the vulgar People, all took the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI>

I have permitted them, pre&s;ume to play the Pyrates upon the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
and to trouble the Seas adjoyning to my Empire. If I hear any more
of the&s;e complaints, I will cau&s;e thee and all thy Nation to be Cru|cifi'd.
I know not how the Pre&s;ident appeas'd the Emperour's fury;
this I know in general, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a &s;ecret alliance with
the <HI>Tartars</HI> again&s;t <HI>Coxinga.</HI> Him the Inhabitants of <HI>Fockien</HI> call'd to
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, having rais'd an Army of 200000 Men; whereupon
he went to aid them with a very powerful Navy. After &s;everal Skir|mi&s;hes,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> came to a pitch'd Field, where the
Captain of the <HI>Tartars</HI> having plac'd the be&s;t part of his Cavalry in
Ambu&s;h, order'd his Men to retreat by degrees, 'till they had drawn
the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> into the Ambu&s;cade; at what time the <HI>Tartars</HI> encom|pa&s;&s;ing
them on every &s;ide, kill'd 80000 upon the place; <HI>Coxinga</HI> with
his Navy not being able to relieve them.</P>
<P>During this War, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took their opportunity, and made
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the I&s;land of <HI>Fi&s;hers,</HI> between <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> and the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Fockien.</HI> In a &s;hort while after <HI>Coxinga</HI> dy'd, and <HI>Savia</HI> his
Uncle, the riche&s;t Merchant of <HI>China,</HI> who out of his own revenue
had disburs'd the expences of the la&s;t War, grew weary of the charge,
and was de&s;irous to make Peace with the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Of which one of
the Sons of <HI>Coxinga</HI> being advertiz'd, &s;eiz'd upon his Uncles per&s;on,
and &s;hut him up in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on, where he kill'd him&s;elf for madne&s;s.
The <HI>Hollanders</HI> overjoy'd at the Dath of <HI>Savia,</HI> who had always hin|der'd
them from the Trade of the Province of <HI>Fockien,</HI> &s;ent a Navy
again&s;t his Nephew in favour of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who made War again&s;t
him all along the Sea-Coa&s;t. Several Combats happen'd between the
<HI>Juncks</HI> of the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> and the <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els in view of the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
who &s;atisfi'd them&s;elves with being only Spectators. But all the benefit
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> reap'd from the advantages which they obtain'd
over the <HI>I&s;landers,</HI> was only to put into the Hands of the <HI>Tartars</HI> the
Cities of <HI>Bemos</HI> aed <HI>Que&s;moy,</HI> and all the places thereabouts, which
<HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party po&s;&s;e&s;s'd before. For notwith&s;tanding all their kindne&s;s,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> would not a&s;&s;i&s;t them to retake <HI>Tayovan;</HI> &s;o that they only
were content to build certain &s;mall Forts in the &s;mall I&s;lands adjoyning
to <HI>Formo&s;a:</HI> and &s;ince my return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> I never could inform
my &s;elf of the truth of the i&s;&s;ue of that Enterprize.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not content with their &s;ettlement at <HI>Firmando,</HI>
which was an I&s;land both de&s;ert and barren, &s;eated upon a Streight,
<PB N="18" REF="77">
which &s;eparates the Point of the Land of <HI>Corea</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> a place no
way commodious for their De&s;igns of Engro&s;&s;ing the Trade of <HI>China,</HI>
as being too remote from <HI>Nangi&s;aqui:</HI> Be&s;ides, that the North and South
Winds are &s;o violent at their Sea&s;ons in this Streight, between the two
Coa&s;ts, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to come near the &s;hoar when they blow.
The Pre&s;ident therefore having &s;uch good luck in the Expul&s;ion of the
<HI>Portugals</HI> out of <HI>Japon,</HI> doubted not but that he might obtain the &s;mall
I&s;land of <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> an I&s;land that had been wholly de&s;erted ever &s;ince the
Habitations of the people had been de&s;troy'd. At fir&s;t he only de&s;ir'd
leave to build a &s;mall Tenement for the conveniency of the Factors.
Now between this I&s;land and <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> there is only a narrow Frith,
not above a Musquet Shot over. Here the Pre&s;ident de&s;ir'd the Gover|nour
that he might make a Bridge of Boats for a more ea&s;ie intercour&s;e
between the City and the Port. The Governour gain'd by Pre&s;ents,
gave him leave to build the Bridge; but &s;eeing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made an
ill u&s;e of it, and that they came too frequently and numerou&s;ly into the
City, he built two Forts at both ends of the Bridge, and furni&s;h'd
them with Souldiers, who were to take notice who pa&s;s'd to and fro.
He al&s;o publi&s;h'd an Order, That &s;uch <HI>Hollanders</HI> as came by day into
the Town, &s;hould return to their Lodgings before night, upon pain
of Death. This Order, and the little conveniency which they had for
Lodging in their own Quarters, very much troubl'd them; &s;o that the
Pre&s;ident made new Applications at Court, and obtain'd leave to build
a Factory, and Warehou&s;es for their Goods.</P>
<P>The Governour thereupon &s;ent a Surveyor to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to mark
out the Ground which the Emperour had given them to build upon.
This per&s;on being largely rewarded, made them good mea&s;ure, and
yet they were not contented; &s;o that in the Night-time they had
enlarg'd their Quarters, by removing the fir&s;t marks. The Governour,
being advertiz'd thereof, began to be very angry; but they found means
to appea&s;e him with their Pre&s;ents: &s;o that he ea&s;ily conde&s;cended to the
&s;light rea&s;ons which they gave him for what they had done. Thus in
a &s;hort time they fini&s;h'd their work, which was without encompa&s;s'd
with a Wall, much like a Garden Wall, but within contain'd a real
Fort, flanck'd and lin'd according to all the Rules of Art; and which,
the outward Wall being beaten down, not only defended their Bridge,
but commanded the entry into the Haven of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui.</HI></P>
<P>They took great care not to admit any but <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for fear their
De&s;ign &s;hould be di&s;cover'd. So that when the whole was fini&s;h'd, the
Pre&s;ident gave advice to the General at <HI>Batavia</HI> what he had done,
de&s;iring him to &s;end him eight Bra&s;s Guns, &s;o broken, as to be ea&s;ily
put together in the places where they were broken. He adviz'd him
al&s;o to put them up in Hog&s;heads, pack'd up like other Goods; and
in&s;tead of Mariners, to &s;end a good number of Souldiers, habited like
Mariners, for the &s;ecurity of the Factory. But this Stratagem had not
that &s;ucce&s;s which he expected; for about that time the Emperour had
&s;ent a new Governour to <HI>Nangi&s;aqui:</HI> So that when the Ships arriv'd at
<HI>Batavia,</HI> the new chang'd Officers, being more vigilant then the for|mer,
coming to weigh the Bales as they were put a&s;hore, and finding
certain Hog&s;heads at the bottom of the hold, which they could not re|move
by rea&s;on of their weight, they pre&s;ently brake them up, and
perceiving there the broken pieces of Canons, carry'd &s;ome of them
<PB N="19" REF="77">
to the Governour, who immediately &s;ent intelligence thereof to <HI>Yeddo,</HI>
of which the Pre&s;ident had as &s;uddain notice by his Pen&s;ioners. He
having his invention at command, repairs forthwith to the Emperour's
Court, and there tells the Emperour, That he had receiv'd Orders
from his Superiours to pre&s;ent him with certain Peeces of Canon, made
according to the newe&s;t Invention of his Country, the u&s;e whereof
was &s;o convenient, that they were with little difficulty and trouble to
be drawn up, and made u&s;e of, where others could not po&s;&s;ibly be brought
to play: and that he thought no Pre&s;ent could be more acceptable or &s;er|viceable
to him, to render him Victorious over his Enemies. Upon
this the Emperour was very well &s;atisfi'd, and &s;ent to the Governour
of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui</HI> to &s;end him tho&s;e Guns, and withall, not to mole&s;t the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> either in their Factory, or in vending their Wares.</P>
<P>Having &s;o fortunately di&s;engag'd him&s;elf out of the&s;e Briers, he lays
another de&s;ign, and &s;ends to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> a per&s;on of a
turbulent and unquiet Spirit like him&s;elf, to &s;et out two Ve&s;&s;els, to
make a di&s;covery of all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Japon,</HI> and particularly of tho&s;e
Coa&s;ts which were next the Gold Mines, and to &s;ee if they could find
any &s;afe Harbour for Ships to ride in, in tho&s;e tempe&s;tuous Seas, or any
places proper to fortifie, that they might no longer depend upon the
uncertain humour of the Court of <HI>Japon,</HI> which was as incon&s;tant as
their Seas. The General provided two Ships, and furni&s;h'd them with
excellent Pilots, good Souldiers, expert Mariners, and Provi&s;ions for
two years, with all other Nece&s;&s;aries and In&s;truments, as well for del|ving
as building. One of the &s;even of the General's Council was chos'n
Supervi&s;or of the Enterprize. 'Tis &s;aid, that tho&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els skirted
all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Japon,</HI> from the Ea&s;t to the South, and from the
South to the North, fetching a compa&s;s about the I&s;lands to the 47 <HI>deg.</HI>
of Northern Latitude, and that they di&s;cover'd one I&s;land which they
call'd <HI>The States I&s;land,</HI> and afterwards touch'd upon another Land
which they nam'd <HI>The Company's Land,</HI> inhabited by White people,
with long Hair, habited after the <HI>Japon</HI> fa&s;hion, which they found to
be a Continent adjoyning to <HI>Niulhan,</HI> and <HI>Corea;</HI> and that after they
had wander'd a long time upon the Sea, without any other de&s;ign
then to make new Di&s;coveries, they pa&s;s'd through the Streights of
<HI>Sanguar,</HI> which &s;eparates the Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> and kept along
tho&s;e Coa&s;ts of <HI>Japon</HI> to the Ea&s;t, to ob&s;erve the Bays of <HI>Aizu,</HI> and
<HI>Xendai,</HI> where are the Gold Mines. In that part a furious Tempe&s;t
took them, in &s;ight of the Mountains, where the Gold Mines lye,
which la&s;ted four days together. The &s;econd of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els run full
again&s;t a Rock, and &s;plit her &s;elf, with the total lo&s;s of every Mothers
Son in the Ve&s;&s;el. The Admiral held out a longer time, but coa&s;ting
the Land where the Mountains of <HI>Sataque</HI> appear, the Tempe&s;t grew
&s;o violent, that &s;he al&s;o brake again&s;t the Rocks. In this &s;econd Ship|wrack
only the Admiral, and thirteen per&s;ons more e&s;cap'd, partly by
the help of the Planks, and partly by Swiming. The <HI>Japonners</HI> upon
the Coa&s;t pre&s;ently ran to view them, and wonder'd to &s;ee people in
tho&s;e parts, who&s;e Language they did not under&s;tand. Neverthele&s;s,
they entertain'd them civilly enough; but in regard they were Stran|gers,
and that there was a &s;trict prohibition not to receive any Stran|gers
among them upon any pretence what&s;oever, they were at a great
lo&s;s what to do with 'em. One, wi&s;er then the re&s;t, advis'd his
<PB N="20" REF="78">
Brethren to carry them to the Emperour, who&s;e coun&s;el was follow'd;
and &s;o they took their journey toward <HI>Yeddo,</HI> which was above a hun|dred
Leagues off.</P>
<P>The Emperour, being inform'd of their arrival, order'd that they
&s;hould be civilly us'd; and at the end of eight days &s;ent for them, and
caus'd them to be ask'd, of what Country they were, and what De&s;ign
brought them into his Seas? The Admiral, who was a per&s;on of a
ready ingenuity, an&s;wer'd, That he was a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who all his life
time had &s;erv'd his Country as a Souldier, where he had the command
of a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Foot, at what time Fortune,
or rather the care of pre&s;erving his Honour, forc'd him from his Native
Soyl. I was, &s;aid he, one of the chief Commanders in the Army,
and though I &s;ay it, my Service had gain'd me a fair reputation.
The Prince, who commanded us, had a great confidence in me, which
made one of his near Relations jealous of me; &s;o that he was not only
content to do me all ill Offices with the General, but &s;ought all occa|&s;ions
to pick a quarrel with me. I dare be bold to &s;ay, that had he not
been &s;o nearly related to the Prince, I &s;hould not have taken his affronts
&s;o long patiently. But at length he provok'd that patience to &s;uch a
degree, and &s;o deeply and openly affronted me, that I was con&s;train'd
to meet him with my Sword in my hand. His misfortune and mine &s;o
order'd it, that I kill'd him at the fir&s;t pu&s;h. My Friends a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to
make my e&s;cape, and kept me hid for &s;ome days, thinking to have ap|peas'd
the Princes anger; but it continu'd &s;o violent, that they advis'd
me to ab&s;ent my &s;elf for &s;ome years. Therefore to render my Exile le&s;s
tedious, and that I might be &s;till doing &s;omething for the Service of my
Country, I de&s;ir'd my Friends to furni&s;h me with two Ships, with a
re&s;olution to &s;eek out and de&s;troy all tho&s;e Pirates that infe&s;ted the <HI>Indian</HI>
Seas. I have been in chace of them for a whole year together; and
&s;ometimes we met with Tempe&s;ts &s;o violent, that drave us we know not
whither our &s;elves, my Pilots not being experienc'd in the Ea&s;tern Seas.
Soon after meeting with another Tempe&s;t no le&s;s rude and boy&s;trous,
we were forc'd to let our Ships drive as the Winds them&s;elves were
pleas'd to force them, which at length drove us upon the Coa&s;ts of this
Empire, where we have &s;uffer'd Shipwrack, not having &s;av'd above
fourteen of four hundred, which I brought along with me. Happy
in &s;uch a misfortune, to be ca&s;t upon the Territories of a Prince &s;o
potent and generous, that, no que&s;tion, will have compa&s;&s;ion upon our
mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had repeated this Relation to the Emperour, the
Prince, and all the Lords of the Court were very much concern'd, and
admir'd both the Courage and A&s;pect of the Stranger. The Emperour &s;ent
him very rich Pre&s;ents, and to all tho&s;e of his Company; and gave
Order, that he &s;hould be conducted to <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> to the <HI>Holland</HI> Factory,
and that he &s;hould be well treated upon the way, during the whole
journey, which was five and twenty or thirty days Travel. There
this famous Champion &s;tay'd four Months, in expectation of the Ships
that come every year from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japon;</HI> &s;o that he had time enough
to make a full Relation of the Lands which he had ob&s;erv'd, and of all
the particulars of the Shipwrack. One day as he was telling how he had
cajoll'd the Emperour, and that the Pre&s;ident was applauding the quick|ne&s;s
of his wit for inventing &s;uch an imaginary piece of Knight-Errantry,
<PB N="21" REF="78">
a <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Boy that &s;erv'd the Pre&s;ident, heard all the di&s;|cour&s;e,
without being ob&s;erv'd by his Ma&s;ter. Some Months after,
the Pre&s;ident had beaten this Boy, which he, as all the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> are
of a fiery and vindicative Nature, re&s;olving to revenge, went to the
Governour of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> and repeated to him the whole Di&s;cour&s;e
between his Ma&s;ter and the Admiral. The Governour, finding it to
be a bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, &s;ends advice thereof to the Court. The
Emperour was &s;o enrag'd at the injury and affront put upon him, that
he commanded the Governour to &s;top the Admiral and his Train, and to
&s;end him with a good Guard to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and not to let any Ship enter the
Harbour, 'till he had had a full Examination of the matter.</P>
<P>This Order was not &s;o &s;ecret, but that the Pre&s;idents Friends had
notice thereof, who pre&s;ently gave him intelligence of it &s;o &s;ea&s;onably,
that the Admiral was &s;ent away before the Order came to the Governour.
Eight days after, three <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els arriv'd at <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> to whom the
Governour &s;ent expre&s;s command to keep out at Sea, and not to come
a&s;hore. The Pre&s;ident feigning to be &s;urpriz'd at this Prohibition, went
to the Governour to know the rea&s;on, who gave him this An&s;wer, The
Emperour, &s;aid he, is acquainted with your tricks, you &s;hall have no
more kindne&s;s from me; I have &s;ent to Court to give notice of the
arrival of your three Ships, and I &s;hall follow my Orders when they
come. Upon this the Pre&s;ident made no doubt but the Admiral's &s;tory
was di&s;cover'd; and recollecting with him&s;elf that he had beaten his
<HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Boy, and that he was run away from him, he &s;oon conjectur'd
at the Author of all the mi&s;chief. In &s;hort, the Governour receives his
Orders, the Tenour whereof was, That he &s;hould &s;end away the three
Ve&s;&s;els, without permitting them to land either Men or Goods; and
that he &s;hould tell the Pre&s;ident, That the Emperour was &s;atisfi'd that
the Admiral was a Cheat and a Spy, whom he intended to puni&s;h
&s;everely; and therefore, if he did not &s;end for him to <HI>Japon</HI> by the fir&s;t
opportunity of the Winds, he would put to Death all tho&s;e of his
Nation, and fling their Goods into the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon the return of three Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there was no &s;mall hurly
burly in the I&s;land; for by them they under&s;tood the danger that their
Country-men were in, if they did not &s;end back the Admiral. There|upon
an extraordinary Council was call'd, to deliberate upon an affair
of &s;o great importance, who were all of one mind, that the Admi|ral
was to be &s;ent back, and that it was better for one to &s;uffer, then a
whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Admiral being advertiz'd of this their re&s;olution, publickly pro|te&s;ted
again&s;t the violence and inju&s;tice they were about to do him;
telling them, that he was born a Subject of the Republick of <HI>Holland,</HI>
who had only the Power of his life and death; that in their Service, he
would expo&s;e his life to a thou&s;and hazards, but that he was not oblig'd
to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for the particular Intere&s;ts of a private Trade.
The Mini&s;ters took his part, and made it a ca&s;e in Religion. The
common people mutiny'd again&s;t the General, and the Tumult
grew to that heat, that the Sea-men were &s;ent for from aboard their
Ships to di&s;per&s;e the multitude. At length, by the interpo&s;ition of
a Mini&s;ter, the bu&s;ine&s;s was brought to a conclu&s;ion; who per&s;waded
the Admiral by his &s;mooth Language, to appea&s;e the di&s;order of the
people, by &s;ubmitting to the Re&s;ult of the Council. Thereupon he
<PB N="22" REF="79">
promis'd to return to <HI>Japon,</HI> provided they would allow him what he
demanded, not only for his reward, but al&s;o that which &s;hould bear
him out in that &s;ame new part which he had in his head to act.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he demanded two Ships magnificently trim'd, a Train of fifty
cho&s;en Men, every one of which was to have three changes of Habit,
of the riche&s;t Stuffs that could be had: Moreover 50000 Crowns for
his Voyage, a Cupboard of Gold and Silver Plate, with all Equipage
proportionable, and that tho&s;e that accompany'd him &s;hould re&s;pect
him, as a per&s;on of great Quality.</P>
<P>All this was allow'd him, and the Admiral departed from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and
arriv'd well at <HI>Nangi&s;aqui.</HI> The Governour &s;urpriz'd at the beauty of
the Ve&s;&s;els, could not believe them to be Merchants, and therefore &s;ent
to know who they were; but he was more &s;urpriz'd when he knew
that it was the Admiral. Forthwith he di&s;patch'd a Courrier to the Em|perour,
to give him notice, and to inform him with what magnificence
the Admiral was return'd. The Pre&s;ident al&s;o &s;ent, that he might have
a favourable reception, and to de&s;ire his Friends to let the Emperour
know, that this was a Per&s;on of great Quality, whom an Honourable
Action had driven from his Country, and that he no &s;ooner under&s;tood
the accu&s;ation that lay again&s;t him, but that he was return'd with that
Equipage that became him, to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Till the Order came, the Governour, according to cu&s;tom, caus'd
all the Sails and Rudders of the Ships to be brought to him, not per|mitting
any per&s;on to come a&s;hore. At length the Order came, that
the Admiral and his Attendants &s;hould be receiv'd into the City, toge|ther
with all things nece&s;&s;ary for their per&s;ons, and that they &s;hould be
convoy'd to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and that in all places where they came, they &s;hould
be nobly treated. The Pre&s;ident accompany'd the Admiral to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him, as well with his Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ils, as with the favour of his Friends.
Their Entry was very magnificent, and the richne&s;s of their Habits
brought the people from all parts, as being mainly greedy after No|velty,
&s;o that the noi&s;e thereof was &s;pread all over the Court: Yet the
Emperour would not admit them to their Audience upon the day which
they de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>Two Months were elaps'd, during which time the Admiral kept
open Table, and di&s;play'd his da&s;ling Riches to the Eyes of the <HI>Japone&s;es,</HI>
and being of a quick and apprehen&s;ive wit, he caus'd him&s;elf to be in|&s;tructed
in the Language of the I&s;land, and in a &s;hort time he began to un|der&s;tand
many Words. When the Emperour &s;ent for him, he clad him&s;elf
and his Train in a richer Habit then that which they had on when he
made his Entry. At fir&s;t the Emperour &s;eem'd to be angry; I under&s;tand,
&s;aid he, that thou art an Impo&s;tor and a Traytor, that thy Birth is
ob&s;cure, and that thou art come as a &s;py into my Kingdom, and therefore
I am re&s;olv'd to puni&s;h thee according to thy merits.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had explain'd the Emperour's words, the
Admiral with an undaunted countenance, Sir, &s;aid he, a Prince &s;o
great as you are, &s;hould rather be a comfort and &s;upport to the unfortu|nate,
then add to their affliction. Fortune, that per&s;ecutes me, has
in nothing been more cruel to me, then in rai&s;ing tho&s;e Calumnies,
with which &s;he has endeavour'd to blemi&s;h my reputation with your Ma|je&s;ty.
She might expell me my Country, and ca&s;t me upon unknown
Coa&s;ts at the other end of the World; but &s;he can never in&s;pire into
<PB N="23" REF="79">
me thoughts unworthy of my Birth. This is the &s;econd time I have been
within your Dominions, the fir&s;t by occa&s;ion of Shipwrack, the &s;econd
to obey your Maje&s;ties commands. The fir&s;t accu&s;es none but the
Winds. And had I been guilty of what I am accus'd, I &s;hould never have
ventur'd my &s;elf into your hands &s;o far off from your Power. But,
Sir, my Accu&s;ers have one advantage which I have not; they &s;peak
your Language, I under&s;tand it not, nor how to make you apprehend
the truth of my ju&s;tification. Allow me eight Months to learn the
Speech of your Country, and then, if you will be &s;o gratious as to hear
me, I make no doubt but to confound my Accu&s;ers, and to &s;atisfie your
Maje&s;ty in all things.</P>
<P>The Emperour was &s;urpriz'd, and mov'd with his An&s;wer, but more
e&s;pecially at his reque&s;t of eight Months to learn the <HI>Japonick</HI> Language.
I grant it thee, &s;aid the Emperour, for it is but ju&s;t that a per&s;on ac|cus'd
&s;hould have both the Liberty and means to do it. And in the mean
time I will take care that thou be honourably entertain'd in all places
where thou ha&s;t a de&s;ire to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Admiral us'd this Liberty with &s;o much prudence, and got &s;o
much the love of the Courtiers by his carriage and his liberality, that
by their conver&s;e, he not only learnt the Language, but by vertue
of their good Character, the Emperour would often &s;end for him, and
ask him &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning our <HI>Europe,</HI> in reference to the
Qualities of the Countries, the Manners of the People, the &s;everal
Forms of Government, the Extent of the &s;everal Kingdoms, their
Riches, Strength, and War-like Di&s;cipline; of all which, the Admi|ral
gave him &s;o hand&s;ome an Accompt, that the Prince took great de|light
in his Di&s;cour&s;e. And at length he had gain'd &s;o much the favour
and confidence of the Emperour, that he utterly laid a&s;ide all the ill
thoughts which he had of him, and condemn'd to Death, as a fal&s;e
Witne&s;s, and a Traducer, the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> that had accus'd him.</P>
<P>After &s;o fortunate an e&s;cape, the Admiral thought it but common
prudence to make a fair retreat in the Grandeur of his Reputation, and
thereupon he took leave of the Emperour, who loaded him with Honours
and Pre&s;ents. The Courtiers were al&s;o &s;orry for his departure, &s;o that
&s;ome of them accompany'd him back, and took order for his entertain|ment,
which was very magnificent all the way to <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> where
he took Shipping a few days after, and return'd to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>All the People throng'd to the Port to &s;ee him when he Landed. He
told them in few words the &s;ucce&s;s of his Voyage. Some applauded
his ingenuity and courage; others extoll'd the Service which he had
done the Company and Nation. The Council receiv'd him al&s;o with
thanks and prai&s;es, and gave him all the Gold and Plate which he had
brought back. A while after he departed for <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where he
was no &s;ooner arriv'd, but he pre&s;ented a Petition to the States General
again&s;t the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, for &s;ending him back to <HI>Japon,</HI> and for
reparation of the violence and injury done him. The bu&s;ine&s;s was
long in debate, but at la&s;t the Company was condemn'd to pay him
great damages, and Intere&s;t for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But to return to the Pre&s;ident: He began now to be weary of being
confin'd to one Factory, though he made up his Pack well enough
where he was. But his Ambition carry'd him farther, and he thought
he had done Service enough to be advanc'd to a higher Dignity. Nei|ther
<PB N="24" REF="80">
was his pre&s;ence &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at <HI>Japon,</HI> where he had &s;ettl'd the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Trade in as good a condition as it could well be. And in truth,
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had then almo&s;t the whole Trade of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI>
They had taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h, Formo&s;a, Amboyna,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ooleron,</HI> and
by that means engro&s;s'd all the Trade of Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs.
They had taken <HI>Baton</HI> by &s;urprize. The Inhabitants of the <HI>Celebes,
Ternate,</HI> and <HI>Tidor,</HI> were become their Va&s;&s;als; and the King of <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ar</HI>
having made an Alliance with them, had expell'd the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI>
out of his Dominions. By means of their Factories in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> they
had got all the Pepper Trade of the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of that I&s;land into
their hands, be&s;ides &s;everal other advantages which they had in &s;everal
other places, where they had encroach'd upon the <HI>Portugals, Spaniards,</HI>
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> them&s;elves. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at that time enter|tain'd
140 Ships, part Men of War, and part Merchant-men, pro|vided
with great Guns, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ion of all &s;orts, and
in the&s;e Ships above 6000 Men, part Souldiers, part Mariners. <HI>Bata|via</HI>
was the Soul of their Conque&s;ts, made upon the Ruins of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI>
which had they lain all together, would have made a large
Empire, and by which they might have grown infinitely rich, had
not the expences of their Navies and Souldiers eaten out the gains of
their va&s;t Trade. One of their wi&s;e&s;t Generals told me frequently,
<HI>We have,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but too many Fortre&s;&s;es, we need no more then the</HI> Cape
of Good Hope, <HI>and</HI> Batavia, <HI>Factories well &s;ettl'd, good Ships, and hone&s;t
Men to &s;erve us.</HI> For in &s;hort, their Officers pillage unmercifully, and
cau&s;e the Commerce and Dominion of their Country men to be dete&s;ted
by the <HI>Indians,</HI> through their <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>I know my &s;elf, that in the year 1664, the Expences of the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> amounted, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> to twelve Millions a year,
not to reckon Shipwracks, decay of Ships, and wa&s;t of Goods, and
yet their Cargo's for <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> have not amounted to above ten
Millions; and &s;ometimes the Cargo's are &s;o mean, that the Receits do
not an&s;wer the Expences. Neverthele&s;s their per&s;everance and courage
were worthy of admiration. For what could be more to be admir'd,
then to &s;ee that a &s;mall number of Merchants, a&s;&s;embled at fir&s;t upon
the &s;ingle &s;core of Trade, &s;hould afterwards pre&s;ume to make War in
Regions &s;o far di&s;tant, a&s;&s;ail &s;o many Princes and Nations, plant &s;o
many Colonies, be&s;iege &s;o many Cities and Forts, and la&s;tly, &s;et forth
&s;o many Navies at &s;uch prodigious Expences, that it would put many
potent Soveraigns to a plunge to do as they did?</P>
<P>This was the E&s;tate of the <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, at what time
the Pre&s;ident, the principal Subject of this Relation, was recall'd from
<HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there to take upon him the Office of <HI>Chief Director.</HI>
He carry'd thither great &s;tore of Wealth, and built &s;everal magnificent
Hou&s;es in the City. His Authority al&s;o was very large; but he exer|cis'd
it according to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, and was hated by all the Officers
of the Company, and the Citizens them&s;elves. He thought him&s;elf
&s;ecure of the Employment of General, but he was deceiv'd in his hopes;
upon which he took pet, and return'd for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where he liv'd
quietly for &s;ome years. At length his turbulent and ambitious Spirit put
him upon new De&s;igns, to revenge the injury which he thought he had
receiv'd. To which purpo&s;e he return'd to the <HI>Indies.</HI> His undertaking
was not &s;o pro&s;perous for tho&s;e that employ'd him, and who merited to
<PB N="25" REF="80">
have been better &s;erv'd. He pillag'd, couzen'd, and caus'd &s;everal
di&s;orders in their affairs, and at length returning home again, peri&s;h'd
in the River of <HI>Lisbon</HI> with his Money and Jewels, as hath been already
related.</P>

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF
What pa&s;s'd in the Negotiation of the DEPUTIES
Which were &s;ent to
PERSIA and the INDIES,
As well on the behalf of the KING, as of the
FRENCH COMPANY, for the &s;ettling of Trade.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Relation which I have undertaken, I &s;hall
make a faithful Report of things in &s;uch manner as
I &s;aw them tran&s;acted by the Deputies &s;ent to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
and the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well on the behalf of the King,
as of the <HI>French</HI> Company, for the &s;ettlement of
Trade.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth of <HI>July,</HI> 1665. the Sieur <HI>Lalin,</HI>
Gentleman in Extraordinary to the King, and the
Sieur <HI>de la Boulaye,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Anjou,</HI> with the Sieurs <HI>Beber,
Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont,</HI> Deputies of the new <HI>French</HI> Company, for the
&s;ettling of Trade in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and took
up their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> being the Suburbs of the &s;ame City, where
al&s;o at that time liv'd the Sieur <HI>L'E&s;toile,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Merchant. <HI>Lalin</HI> and
<HI>Boulaye,</HI> without &s;aying any thing to the Deputies, deliver'd to <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI>
the Letters which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lyonne</HI> had written to him; the In&s;crip|tion
whereof was thus. <HI>To Mr.</HI> L'E&s;toile, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Valet du Chambre <HI>to the
King of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>or in his ab&s;ence, to Mr.</HI> Logis, <HI>his Son in Law.</HI> Which
was not a little to be admir'd at by the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had &s;ojourn'd any
time in that Country, to find that Mon&s;ier <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who had been be|fore
in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;hould have better under&s;tood the Cu&s;tom of the
Court, &s;hould be no better able to in&s;truct a Secretary of State, then to
let him give <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI> the Title of <HI>Valet du Chambre</HI> to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="81">
who has none to &s;erve him in his Chamber but Eunuchs, and never
&s;uffers a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to touch his Habits, for fear of being defil'd.</P>
<P>The purport of the Letters, was to admoni&s;h <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI> to &s;upport;
a&s;&s;i&s;t, and protect the Deputies in the Bu&s;ine&s;s upon which the Com|pany
had &s;ent them; and in ca&s;e of lo&s;&s;es by the way, to furni&s;h them
with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they &s;hould want.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was then three days journey from <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> for
which rea&s;on a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patch'd with a Letter to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> or
Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and another to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> or his
Lieutenant, to know whether his Maje&s;ty would command them to
wait on him there, or whether they &s;hould expect his return to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the Deputies could not agree among&s;t them&s;elves:
For the three Merchants <HI>Beber, Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont</HI> affirm'd, that
the two Gentlemen were only intere&s;ted by the by in this Negotiation;
and that having no right to take cognizance of the Affairs of the Com|pany,
they ought not to trouble them&s;elves any farther, then the King's
Letters directed them, in the affairs of the Company. That the Effect
of the King's Letters was no more, then that two Gentlemen, de&s;irous
to &s;ee the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were joyn'd with the Deputies of the Com|pany;
and therefore it belong'd to them only to treat with the Mini&s;ters
of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That the Gentlemen had no more to do then to
deliver the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, and to de&s;ire a
nomination of Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Deputies. This con|te&s;t,
which all the <HI>Franks</HI> in vain endeavour'd to compo&s;e, came at
length to the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Ears; who was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd at it, having
then a de&s;ign to procure an Order from the King to remove out of
<HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and the Suburbs, all the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of what opinion &s;oever, and
place them over again&s;t <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Deputies rais'd new objections and difficulties every
day; which Father <HI>Raphael</HI> of <HI>Mans,</HI> Superiour of the Order of <HI>Capu|chins</HI>
in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> employ'd all his credit and indu&s;try to accommodate.
He wrote them out &s;everal forms of a Letter, which they were to &s;end
to the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but tho&s;e that pleas'd the one Party, did not like the other.
At length Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> weary of &s;cribling and altering, amending and
correcting, and all to no purpo&s;e; told them &s;eriou&s;ly, they did ill to
act in &s;uch a manner, and to in&s;i&s;t upon idle formalities; that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Style, wherein they ought to write to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> ought to be conci&s;e
and plain, without &s;uperfluities, or impertinencies; and la&s;tly, that
all their contentions did but redound to the di&s;advantage of the Com|pany,
who&s;e Intere&s;ts they pretended to manage. After &s;everal con|te&s;ts,
Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> at la&s;t, fini&s;h'd the Letter to the content of both
Parties, which was tran&s;crib'd into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; with ano|ther
to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> and both were di&s;patch'd away. The <HI>Nazar</HI>
having read it, pre&s;ently inform'd the King of the <HI>French</HI> Companies
de&s;ign, and of the arrival of the Deputies. His Maje&s;ty commanded
him to let them know that they were welcome, and that in a &s;hort
time, he would return to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and give them Audience.</P>
<P>Some few dayes after, the Court return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and while the
King &s;topp'd at one of his Hou&s;es near the Gates of the City, the <HI>Nazar</HI>
&s;ent for Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to know of him who the <HI>French</HI> Deputies were,
and who had &s;ent them into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to which the Father gave him the
be&s;t &s;atisfaction he could. For the <HI>Nazar</HI> wonder'd that they were
<PB N="28" REF="82">
come into the Kingdom, and &s;ent, as they &s;aid, from &s;uch a potent
Prince, and yet that the Governours of <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris</HI> &s;hould know
nothing of their pa&s;&s;age through tho&s;e Cities. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> al&s;o
was in the &s;ame A&s;toni&s;hment; and it gave them rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect both
the Quality of their Per&s;ons, and the Reality of their Commi&s;&s;ion.
For either they were ignorant of the cu&s;tom of the Country, or el&s;e
they did ill to travel <HI>incognito,</HI> like ordinary Trade&s;men, and Per&s;ons of
mean condition. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> having a&s;&s;ur'd them, that they
were &s;ent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to &s;ettle a Company of Trade, and
that he had Letters of Advice thereof out of <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Nazar</HI> bid
Father <HI>Raphael</HI> tell the Deputies they &s;hould be in a readine&s;s, for that
the King would give them Audience in a few days.</P>
<P>But the former mi&s;under&s;tanding, &s;till continuing between the Gen|tlemen
and Deputies, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fearing &s;ome mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quence
of it in the pre&s;ence of the King, or that they &s;hould make &s;ome
di&s;pute for priority, the Father repre&s;ented to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that whereas
the Deptuies were of two Orders, the one of Gentlemen, and the
other of Merchants; therefore to take away all &s;u&s;pition of jealou&s;ie,
it would do well, that His Maje&s;ty would be pleas'd when he admitted
them to their Audience, to permit the Gentlemen their &s;eats on the one
&s;ide, and the Merchants on the other. Which the <HI>Nazar</HI> approv'd, and
the King allow'd of the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The 27^t^h of <HI>September,</HI> the King being at his Palace of <HI>Scader-Abbas,</HI>
upon the bank of the River, between the Bridge of <HI>Zulpha,</HI>
and the Bridge of <HI>Schiras,</HI> caus'd a preparation of Artificial Fire-works
to be made, which came to above 2000 <HI>l.</HI> and early in the Morning
caus'd notice to be given, that he intended that day to give audience to
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Deputies. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> al&s;o had Order to be
ready with the Deputies, to the end, the <HI>Mehemender,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of
the Ceremonies, might not be oblig'd to wait. Accordingly that very
day the <HI>Mehemender</HI> came to <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and from thence con|ducted
the Deputies, with all their Train, and the re&s;t of the Franks
then re&s;ident in tho&s;e parts all mounted on Hor&s;e-back, with a march &s;o
&s;low and grave, and for the advantage of the &s;ight &s;o far about, that it
was almo&s;t Night before they arriv'd at <HI>Scader-Abbas;</HI> at what time the
<HI>Mehemender</HI> enter'd the Palace alone, leaving the Merchants at the
Door. In the mean while, the Merchants believing that Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
did not favour them &s;o much as the Gentlemen, cry'd out aloud, that
they would have an Interpreter al&s;o for them&s;elves, or el&s;e would go no
farther. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> who acted only by the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Order, and
for the advantage of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, told them, that whither they
went any farther or no it was all one to him: that for his part he was
not there as an Interpreter, either for the one or the other, but only in
obedience to the King's commands.</P>
<P>In the mid'&s;t of this debate the <HI>Mehemender</HI> return'd to carry the De|puties
to their Audience; five hundred Musketeers being rank'd in order
upon the bank of the River, to give them a Volley as they pa&s;s'd along.
The <HI>Mehemender</HI>'s march at fir&s;t was &s;low and grave, but approaching the
place where the King was, and from whence he had a view of the De|puties,
he caus'd them to double their pace to the foot of the Steps,
where the Lackeys took off their Shooes; and from thence they proceeded
into the Hall of Audience, where the <HI>Kans,</HI> and other great Lords were
<PB N="29" REF="82">
&s;itting. Upon each &s;ide &s;tood the Youth of Quality, &s;umptuou&s;ly clad
in Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver, their Cloaks and Mantles being lin'd
with Martins, Sables, and other rich Furs. The Deputies being come
into the King's pre&s;ence, the <HI>Mehemender</HI> caus'd them to kneel, and
bow their Heads to the Ground three times: That done, he
caus'd them to ri&s;e, and lead up <HI>Lalin</HI> by the hand alone, as being the
per&s;on who had in charge the pre&s;enting of the Letter to the King.
After him follow'd <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Deputies, and thus they
mounted up to the place where &s;ate the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> and the <HI>Nazar.</HI> The
King was &s;eated upon a Scaffold &s;omewhat higher then the re&s;t, encom|pas'd
with 150 young Gentlemen magnificently clad, to whom the
<HI>Sieur Lalin,</HI> at the head of the Deputies, made his compliments in
<HI>French,</HI> and then humbly pre&s;ented the Kings Letter, &s;eal'd with a flat
Seal upon a flying <HI>Label,</HI> enclos'd in an Embroider'd Box, with the
Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> in relief, upon the Lid. Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
explain'd to the King the effect of <HI>Lalin</HI>'s Speech. After which the
King gave a little bow with his Head, and at the &s;ame time gave a &s;ign
to the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies to carry them back to their places.
Being come to the bottom of the Hall, where the Officers had Order to
&s;eparate the Gentlemen from the Merchants, the Officers by mi&s;take put
<HI>Boulaye</HI> with two of the Merchants, and <HI>Mariage</HI> one of the Mer|chants
with <HI>Lalin,</HI> which made <HI>Boulaye</HI> cry out aloud in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage
<HI>Menbeg-Zadd&egrave;,</HI> I am a Gentlemen; but the thing being done, and
the King being pre&s;ent, there was no help. Then the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Mu&s;ick
began to play for a quarter of an Hour; which having given over,
the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies came again, and carried up Father <HI>Ra|phael,</HI>
and the two Gentlemen, as he &s;uppos'd, of which <HI>Mariage</HI> by
the forementioned mi&s;take happen'd to be one, again to the King: at
what time <HI>Lalin</HI> with a comely grace made his Harangue, and &s;et forth
the occa&s;ion of his Deputation to His Maje&s;ty, of which His Maje&s;ty
te&s;tifi'd his good liking by a nod of his Head. For <HI>Lalin</HI> had a hand&s;om
pre&s;ence, and &s;pake with an acceptable Tone, and his magnificent
Habit very much added to the comely Air of his Per&s;on. The Speech
was expounded by Father <HI>Raphael;</HI> which when he had done, the King
ask'd the Deputies &s;everal Que&s;tions, and then with his hand made them
a &s;ign to retire to their places, beck'ning at the &s;ame time to Father <HI>Ra|phael</HI>
to &s;tay; and cau&s;ing him to come near him, more particularly in|form'd
him&s;elf of the Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Extent of his
Dominions, his Military Di&s;cipline, and his Councils: of all which
the Father gave him the be&s;t accompt he could, and then with the King's
leave, retir'd to his place. This Scene being over, a Flagon of Gold,
and a Gla&s;s were &s;ent to the Deputies, attended with a &s;hort Banquet of
Fruits, and other &s;orts of Food; the In&s;trumental and Vocal Mu&s;ick
playing all the while. Which being over, the King again &s;ent for
<HI>Lalin, Mariage,</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and after a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, having
di&s;mi&s;s'd all but father <HI>Raphael,</HI> he fell into a di&s;pute with him touching
the Unity of the Divine Nature, the nece&s;&s;ity of one Prophet, and
how <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the Seal and Crown of all Prophets. He &s;eem'd to
admire that the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had the Reputation of being People of Wit
and Di&s;cretion, could think <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be a God: to all which parti|culars,
the Father endeavour'd to give the King the be&s;t &s;atisfaction he
could. But then, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being de&s;irous that the three Deputies
<PB N="30" REF="83">
&s;hould partake of the King's favour as the other two had done. Where|upon
the King &s;ent for the other three Deputies, and having di&s;cours'd
a while with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> while Father <HI>Raphael</HI> interpreted between them,
in a &s;hort while he di&s;mi&s;s'd them all again, but Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> with
whom he enter'd into a more jocular Di&s;cour&s;e then the former, of the
Colours, Black and White, and of the Beauty of the <HI>French</HI> Women,
the King confe&s;&s;ing that naturally he did not love Brown Women, the
White complection being more agreeable to him, as being that com|plexion
which alone compos'd the Beauty of Women. The Father
mode&s;tly made his an&s;wer, that Beauty con&s;i&s;ted only in fancy; for
that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> lov'd thick and full Eyebrows, which were not at all
e&s;teem'd in <HI>France.</HI> Then the King ca&s;ting his Eyes upon the Box
wherein the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter lay, he took out the Letter, and
ob&s;erving it to be a &s;mall piece of Parchment, and not &s;uch a one as he
had receiv'd from &s;everal Princes and Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> nor indeed
like tho&s;e which the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had brought him formerly from the King
of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf, in a fair piece of Parchment, with a large Seal deep
cut, he gave evident Demon&s;trations of his contempt of it, and was
about to have thrown it away. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> perceiv'd him to be out
of humour, to whom the King in pur&s;uance of his di&s;like, &s;aid, <HI>Ra|phael,</HI>
I never receive open Letters without a Seal, take it, and let me
&s;ee it no more, for I do not believe it comes from &s;o great a King as the
King of <HI>France,</HI> and at the &s;ame time made him a &s;ign to retire. He
dur&s;t do no otherwi&s;e then take the Letter, and &s;o returning to his place,
he told both <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> what had pa&s;s'd in his Di&s;cour&s;e be|tween
him and the King. Two hours, after that, were &s;pent in be|holding
the <HI>Mummeries</HI> of their common Dancers, a pa&s;time very
u&s;ual in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Which being over, the King &s;ent again for <HI>Lalin,
Mariage,</HI> and the Father; and after &s;ome few Que&s;tions, to whith they
gave the be&s;t An&s;wers they could, he again di&s;mi&s;s'd both the Deputies,
retaining only Father <HI>Raphael</HI> with him. The Father, then taking his
opportunity, told the King, that he had always ob&s;erv'd it to be the
cu&s;tom of the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> to cau&s;e the Letters, which the <HI>European</HI>
Princes &s;ent His Maje&s;ty, to be interpreted in his pre&s;ence. And
therefore, added the Father, I be&s;eech Your Maje&s;ty to permit me to
give the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to the end, it may
be truly interpreted to him according to u&s;ual cu&s;tom. Thereupon the
King made a &s;ign to the Father to give it him, and glad he was to be &s;o
rid of it. The Father ob&s;erving the King in a good humour, &s;poke to
him in behalf of the other three Deputies, that he would be pleas'd to
admit them to be &s;ent for a &s;econd time, in regard the others had been
&s;ent for three times. But the King told him, it was enough for him to
&s;peak to the Gentlemen, let his Mini&s;ters talk with the Merchants.
The Father being then di&s;mi&s;s'd, he &s;ent for <HI>Lalin</HI> alone, for whom he
&s;hew'd him&s;elf to have a very great kindne&s;s and affection; and at the
&s;ame time commanded the <HI>Nazar</HI> to bring him the next day, together
with Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Lagis</HI> the <HI>Geneve&s;e,</HI> who was retain'd in his
Service, to Court, for that he intended to be merry with them. Then
he went on, and told <HI>Lalin,</HI> that &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>French</HI> Ships were arriv'd, he
would &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and make a &s;trict
Alliance with him. <HI>Lalin</HI> reply'd, that His Maje&s;ty of <HI>France</HI> de&s;ir'd
nothing more. Why then, reply'd the King, is not my Alliance &s;uffi|cient,
<PB N="31" REF="83">
but that you mu&s;t go &s;eek the Alliance of the Blacks, from
whom you will not draw tho&s;e advantages, with which you flatter
your &s;elves? For you mu&s;t know, that the Deputies kept their affairs
&s;o &s;ecret, that no body knew of them but all the World, the Servants
as well as the Ma&s;ters. Not con&s;idering, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are good Poli|ticians,
and that that Court is never without Spies. Therefore the
King knew, that as &s;oon as the Deputies had di&s;patch'd at his Court,
they were to depart for the <HI>Indies,</HI> with which Nation he keeps no good
Corre&s;pondence. And for that rea&s;on, he was not a little offended with
them, though they endeavour'd to per&s;uade him, that their Errand to
the <HI>Indies</HI> was only for Linnen and Spices.</P>
<P>The Deputies pre&s;ented to the King a very fair <HI>Fuzee,</HI> together with
the Kings Picture, in little, drawn to the Life, which was &s;o much the
more e&s;teem'd, becau&s;e at the &s;ame time &s;everal large Cuts had been
brought to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and pre&s;ented to the King, which perfectly agreed
with the Picture in Oyl, by which the whole Court was convinc'd that
it was the real Portraiture of the King. When the&s;e Pre&s;ents were laid
before the King, he ask'd the Deputies, for which of the Ea&s;tern Na|tions
the <HI>French</HI> had mo&s;t affection; to whom M. <HI>Lalin</HI> made an&s;wer,
that certainly for the <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> thereupon the King return'd, that cer|tainly
they had rea&s;on; for that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were white, like the <HI>French,</HI>
and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to have any affection for the <HI>Indians</HI>
who were black.</P>
<P>At length the King, to &s;hew the Deputies his highe&s;t favour, would
have them drink the <HI>HEZARD PICHE,</HI> in a golden Cup, which holds
about a Pint of <HI>Paris.</HI> He order'd the Wine to be the &s;ame which he
drank him&s;elf, which was in a Bottle of Chry&s;tal Gla&s;s, &s;tudded with
Diamonds. <HI>Lalin</HI> drank couragiou&s;ly, and &s;o did <HI>Mariage;</HI> but Father
<HI>Raphael</HI> made a fair excu&s;e, and got off. After midnight the <HI>Zerhaftes,</HI>
or Table-Cloaths of Cloth of Gold were &s;pread upon the Floor, and
&s;everal roa&s;ted Viands very hot of the Spice, and Di&s;hes of Salt Fi&s;h,
purchas'd from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, were brought and &s;et upon the Cloaths;
together with &s;everal Pa&s;trie Meats, dry'd Rai&s;ins, Comfits, Almonds,
and Pi&s;taches, and other provocatives to drink. The repa&s;t being
ended, &s;everal Buffons were brought in, who Sung and Danc'd after
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, and made a hundred wry Mouths and ugly Faces.
Among the re&s;t of the Diverti&s;ements, there were two Men introduc'd,
that play'd one again&s;t another with each a Battoon in his hand, with a
piece of Linnen dipt in Naphta, ty'd to the end of the Stick, which ca&s;t
forth a very clear brightne&s;s in the dark; at the &s;ame time four artificial
Whirle-Winds were made to ri&s;e one after another, which were all
hovering in the Air at once, and in a continual Agitation.</P>
<P>Three Hours after Midnight the Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies came to
rai&s;e the Deputies to take leave of the King; and &s;o leading them to
the lower end of the Hall, after a profound reverence, they retir'd, not
one per&s;on be&s;ide &s;tirring out of his place, to the end they might have
time to take their Shoes without confu&s;ion. When they were gone, the
King di&s;mi&s;s'd the Court, and then it is that the croud is &s;o great, that
not one in twenty but lo&s;es their own, and gets who&s;e-ever Shoes he
can lay his hands on.</P>
<P>The Deputies and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being upon their return home, by
that time they got half way, met an Officer belonging to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="84">
who told Father <HI>Raphael</HI> that his Ma&s;ter expected the <HI>French Begzades</HI>
at his Hou&s;e by Ten a Clock next Morning, to treat them, by his Maje&s;ties
Order.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Raphael, Lalin,</HI> and <HI>Boulaye,</HI> were punctual to their time, and
no &s;ooner did the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> know of their arrival, but he came
down into his Hall of Audience, to receive them, where he had al&s;o
order'd a very fair Banquet to be ready for their entertainment. There
Father <HI>Raphael</HI> left them, while he went with the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI>'s Secre|tary,
to Tran&s;late the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lan|guage;
which being fini&s;h'd, and he come again into the Hall, after
&s;everal Civilities pa&s;t on both &s;ides, the Father and the Deputies return'd
to <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant Deputies offended at the Honour which the Gentle|men
had receiv'd, would have gone in their Turn; but Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
told them, that it was not the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to vi&s;it the Prime Mi|ni&s;ter,
without being &s;ent for. In the Evening, Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and
the <HI>Begzades</HI> received new Orders to attend the King, but the King
&s;tirr'd not out that Evening, &s;o that their Journey was in vain.</P>
<P>The Merchants &s;till perceiving the Honours which were done the
Gentlemen, and believing Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to be the cau&s;e of all, they
began to rail at him, and give him foul Language, and threaten'd to
write into <HI>France</HI> to give an accompt of his behaviour. Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
netled at the Language of the Deputies, told them, that he had done
what in him lay to procure them the &s;ame Honours, which the others
had receiv'd, though they were &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of it. That he would
continue his endeavours for the Advancement of their Affairs, though
not for their own &s;akes, yet for the &s;ake of the Company, that had &s;ent
them. Which an&s;wer, though it were &s;harp enough, and &s;hew'd that
the Father was angry, yet he did not forget, that they were his Coun|trymen;
&s;o that he ventur'd to carry them twice to the Prime Mini&s;ter
of his own accord, contrary to the Cu&s;tom. The fir&s;t time he was
not to be &s;poken with. The &s;econd time, he made an Errant to him
with the three Deputies, to pre&s;ent him a Copy of the Letter from the
Directors of the Company, in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; at which time he
&s;hew'd them the Deputies, acquainting him withal that tho&s;e were
the Per&s;ons with whom he was to treat in point of Trade. To which
the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> reply'd, that he had no Commi&s;&s;ion from the King
to meddle with tho&s;e Deputies, but only, to entertain the <HI>Begzade</HI> that
brought the King's Letter, which he had already done. Thereupon
the Father de&s;ir'd him he would be pleas'd to &s;peak to the King to nomi|nate
Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with them, which the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> pro|mis'd
to do. That day in the evening, a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to Father
<HI>Raphael,</HI> to acquaint him, that the King had appointed the <HI>Nazar</HI> to
treat with the Deputies the next day, and to know their demands. Of
which the Father gave the Deputies quick intelligence.</P>
<P>The next day, being the Fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fail'd not
to be with the Deputies very early in the Morning, to bring them to
the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but he was very much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee, that they would not
go altogether, but &s;till loo'k with an evil Eye one upon another, and
continued their former differences. To the end therefore that he might
&s;et things to rights, he went to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and told him, that he
thought it would be the be&s;t way for the Merchants Deputies to come
<PB N="33" REF="84">
fir&s;t, becau&s;e that they were the Per&s;ons with whom he was chiefly to
Treat. The <HI>Nazar</HI> an&s;wer'd, that the King under&s;tood that they were
all five in the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion joyntly. To which, when the Father
an&s;wer'd the &s;econd time, that it would be the be&s;t way to do as he had
propos'd; The <HI>Nazar</HI> with a Surly Countenance, why, What's the
matter now? &s;aid he to the Father; Are not you <HI>French-men</HI> a&s;ham'd to
be thus at odds one with another, and to give all the World, nay the
very Foot-boys occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e of your Divi&s;ions? What would
they have us think of them and their Commi&s;&s;ion? Are they &s;o little afraid
of offending the King? Or, is their King more indulgent then the King
of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who would never pardon &s;uch faults in his Subjects? To this
rebuke the Father made no reply. Only he de&s;ir'd the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that he
might have two Hor&s;e-men to attend the Deputies at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> telling the
<HI>Nazar</HI> not a word of his de&s;ign to bring the Merchants an Hour &s;ooner
then the Gentlemen. This fell out to the Fathers de&s;ire; For the Father
&s;ent one of the Hor&s;e-men to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> to the Gentlemen, with order to
drink with them, and not to be over ha&s;ty, but to bring them fair and
&s;oftly along with him; with the other he made ha&s;t to the Merchant
Deputies, and cau&s;ing them to double their pace, they got betimes to
the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where they were civilly receiv'd. <HI>Dupont</HI> pre&s;ented
the <HI>Nazar</HI> with the Deputies Commi&s;&s;ion, tran&s;lated into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Language; after which they fell into a di&s;cour&s;e, which la&s;ted above
three quartes of an Hour, concerning the Cu&s;toms, Tolls, and Qua|lity
of the Merchants, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> in their Dealing.
They had ju&s;t fini&s;h'd their Di&s;cour&s;e of Trade, when the <HI>Nazar</HI> was
advertiz'd, that the three Gentlemen were arriv'd; who thereupon
de&s;ir'd Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to go and receive them. The Father went and
waited upon them in, neatly chiding them for having &s;tay'd &s;o long,
and making the <HI>Nazar</HI> wait. Well &s;aid he, now you are together, go
into that Cabinet, and write down your demands, and the Articles
of your Commi&s;&s;ion. The Merchant Deputies, which had now di&s;|cours'd
with the <HI>Nazar</HI> what they had to &s;ay, were well enough con|tent
to enter into a General Conference with the Gentlemen. Then
calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, they made a draught of their Demands,
the chief of which were, three Years Immunity from Cu&s;toms and
Tolls, to begin from the time of the arrival of our Ships; and that
after that, they &s;hould enjoy all the Priviledges and Favours granted to
other Nations. They al&s;o de&s;ir'd precedence above all other Nations,
when they &s;hould be call'd to Court, as they &s;ugge&s;ted, that they had
at the Court of the Grand Signior. And la&s;tly, they requir'd a Hou&s;e
for tho&s;e that belong'd to the Company, to live in the City.</P>
<P>The&s;e demands were dictated word for word by Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to the
<HI>Nazars</HI> Secretary, in the Name of all the five Gentlemen; and becau&s;e
the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Secretary knew not how to pronounce them, the Father
undertook to write them in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Character; which being done,
and the writing read in the hearing of the Deputies, the <HI>Nazar</HI> took
the Paper to pre&s;ent to the King.</P>
<P>Thus after a fair Banquet, accompany'd with Mu&s;ic, both Vocal
and In&s;trumental, the Deputies were di&s;mi&s;s'd by the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who bid
them rely upon his care; for that he would do them all the Favour that
lay in his pow'r, and give them his Maje&s;ties An&s;wer in a &s;hort time.
The Deputies very well &s;atisfy'd with the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s reception, &s;ent him
<PB N="34" REF="85">
afterwards a Pre&s;ent, which was a Shame both to the Nation and the
Company, that pretended to &s;uch great and high things, and endea|vour'd
to &s;ix and opinion of their Wealth and Grandeur among Strangers.
For they &s;ent him only a <HI>Tin Cup</HI> Enamel'd, and eight little Ca&s;es of
Per&s;pectives, or Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, the whole not amounting to above
40 Crowns. They al&s;o made much &s;uch another Pre&s;ent, but meaner,
to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about a Dozen Pair of Gilt Sci&s;&s;ars
for Women. We mu&s;t &s;peak the Truth: For they were not a little
&s;aught at for their ridiculous Pre&s;ents, which were the Scorn and
Contempt of tho&s;e that receiv'd them, when the Deputies were
gone.</P>
<P>To Father <HI>Raphael</HI> they pre&s;ented a Pur&s;e, with 40 <HI>Tomans,</HI> or Six
Hundred Crowns in it, believing that he would never accept of it;
and indeed he refus'd it with &s;corn; not a little angry with them, that
they &s;hould have &s;uch mean thoughts of him, as to believe him
Mercenary.</P>
<P>Two days after, the <HI>Nazar</HI> gave notice to the Father, that the King
had granted the <HI>French</HI> their Demands; and had order'd every one of
them a <HI>Calaat,</HI> or a Ve&s;t-Royal, and in re&s;pect of Superiority, a Hor&s;e
for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lalin.</HI> That the Kings An&s;wer and the <HI>Grant</HI> were both
ready for the Directors of the Company, according to their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The King was then onward upon a journey to <HI>Mazandran,</HI> three
days Travel from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> at one of his Palaces, call'd <HI>Tajabat.</HI> A
Plea&s;ant Situation, in the mid'&s;t of a great Valley, &s;haded with Trees,
and full of Villages.</P>
<P>The Ninth of <HI>October,</HI> came a Letter from the <HI>Nazar,</HI> to Father <HI>Ra|phael,</HI>
&s;ignifying the King's Plea&s;ure, that both he and the Deputies
&s;hould repair to <HI>Tajabat</HI> with all &s;peed. Thereupon the Father and they
made &s;uch ha&s;t, that in le&s;s than three days they got to <HI>Tajabat,</HI> where
the <HI>Nazar</HI> order'd them to lye in the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Armenian</HI> Renegado.
The King &s;ent them immediately eight or ten bottles of Wine, with
four Gold Di&s;hes, full of lovely Fruits, and Tapi&s;tries for their
Dining Room. But the&s;e Pre&s;ents occa&s;ion'd new Quarrels; For there
being two Factions, and both living apart, there was a great di&s;pute
who &s;hould have this pre&s;ent. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> having done all
that po&s;&s;ible he could to reconcile the bu&s;ine&s;s, and not being able to
per&s;uade them, in a ju&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, bid them take their Swords and Pi&s;tols,
and go and decide the Quarrel in the Field. Till now, &s;aid he, I have
done all I could to conceal your dete&s;table divi&s;ions from the Court,
which neverthele&s;s, is but too well acquainted therewith: Is it your
de&s;ign to publi&s;h your own Ignominy, and to make not only your &s;elves,
but the whole Nation of the <HI>French</HI> ridiculous to the <HI>Per&s;ians?</HI> At length
they were &s;o far reconcil'd, that one Room &s;erv'd them to Feed, and
con&s;equently the &s;ame Furniture. For the Father's reproofs had put
them a little out of Countenance.</P>
<P>The Seventeenth of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Mehemander</HI> came to the Deputies
Lodgings, and brought five Royal Ve&s;ts; The Riche&s;t, which was of
Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold, was for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lalin;</HI> the next, not altogether &s;o
rich, for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boulaye;</HI> and the other three of a lower price, for
the Merchants; The value of the whole might amount to 600 Crowns,
for which the <HI>French</HI> Deputies mo&s;t generou&s;ly gave the Officers that
brought them 25 or 30 Crowns, as a Gratuity. The Officers of the
<PB N="35" REF="85">
Stable al&s;o brought two Hor&s;es for the Gentlemen, for which they
receiv'd &s;ix Crowns in Gold, as a reward. I confe&s;s, I &s;hould have been
a&s;ham'd of &s;uch a poorne&s;s of Spirit, at &s;uch a time as that.</P>
<P>At length al&s;o the <HI>Ragan</HI> or Patent for the Company was deliver'd
into the Hands of the Deputies, faithfully Tran&s;lated by Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to
this Effect.</P>
<P><Q>That whereas the Merchants of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> who are
favour'd by the Favour extreemly Royal, and the Ju&s;tice exce&s;&s;ively
Royal, being made con&s;tant in the hope and participation in the
time, have pre&s;ented their Petition, which is arriv'd at the Ear
of the Mini&s;ters Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Court of Grandeur and high
Fortune; Their Intentions and Demands have found the Vi&s;age of
Acceptation, and we have &s;trictly commanded, that the Con&s;ervatours
of Rights, Tolls and Priviledges, acknowledge them for exempt
and priviledg'd, during the &s;pace of Three Years; and that there be
nothing demanded upon their Goods and Factories, conformable to
the reque&s;t of the Deputies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The next day, the <HI>Mehemander Bachi,</HI> came early in the Morning to
attend the Deputies, and bring them with all &s;peed to the Court:
Where being admitted into the Garden, they met the King a Hor&s;e-back,
and all the Court a Foot. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> held the King's
An&s;wer to the King of <HI>France,</HI> in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, Seal'd with
the Kings Seal upon red <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wax. The Sieur <HI>Lalin</HI> then, and the
re&s;t of the Deputies were order'd to go neer and Ki&s;s the Kings Boot,
who kept his Grandeur, without &s;peaking a word. When they had
&s;o done, the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> calling them to him, there, &s;aid he, there is
the An&s;wer for the <HI>Grand Cha,</HI> that is, for the King of the Kings of
<HI>France.</HI> The Deputies having made their Obey&s;ances to the King, the
whole Court took Hor&s;e; and the King took the Road of <HI>Cachan;</HI> and
within an Hour, that Campaign, which look'd like a thick peopl'd
City, became as De&s;ert as the mo&s;t part of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Deputies, having read over the Patent, began to find many
defects, and <HI>Mariage</HI> would fain have follow'd the Court for amendments,
and would have per&s;uaded <HI>Lalin</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to have gone along
with him. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> over-per&s;uaded them to retun fir&s;t to
their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and there to hear the Patent di&s;tinctly read
over, and to con&s;ider better of it. When they came to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and
that they had debated upon the meer Letter of the <HI>Patent,</HI> then they
were wor&s;e mad then they were before. Then there were &s;o many
Cavils, &s;o many Di&s;putes, &s;o many Exceptions, and &s;o many Expo|&s;itions
put upon the Words <HI>Conformably</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;onably,</HI> that they mu&s;t
get a Hor&s;e back immediately. <HI>Boulaye</HI> &s;topp'd this fury for a while; So
that after many Di&s;putes and Con&s;ultations, it was agreed, that <HI>Mariage,</HI>
as chief of the Negotiation, and <HI>Lalin,</HI> &s;hould follow the Court; and
that <HI>Boulaye, Breber,</HI> and <HI>Dupont,</HI> &s;hould proceed forward to the <HI>Indies.</HI>
The Sieur <HI>L'E&s;toile,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the <HI>Franks,</HI> were of opinion,
that <HI>Lalin</HI> &s;hould forthwith depart for <HI>France,</HI> with the King's Letter.
But their Coun&s;el was not follow'd, and &s;o the Deputies divided them|&s;elves:
<HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> to follow the Court, which was then remov'd
as far as <HI>Mazandran:</HI> And the other three to pur&s;ue their Journey to
the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> The two former fain would have had Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
have accompany'd them to the Court; but he fairly excus'd him&s;elf.
<PB N="36" REF="86">
Neither would <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI> permit his Son, to whom he allow'd 20 <HI>Tomans</HI>
a Year, to return to the Court, choo&s;ing rather to &s;end him to <HI>Bander</HI>
with the other three. Whereupon, the Seventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> they
&s;et forward upon their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>Du Pont,</HI> without doubt, was the mo&s;t &s;olid and judicious of all the
Merchants, but he took it &s;o to heart, to &s;ee the di&s;-union among them,
that he fell into a langui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;e at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and dy'd not far from
<HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage,</HI> they left <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the Fifteenth of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI>
and arriv'd at Court &s;oon after, where they lay a long time neg|lected,
their Divi&s;ions &s;till continuing, which made them contempti|ble
to the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and ruin'd the Affairs of the Company. One
Evening, the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent them a Flow'r, advi&s;ing them, that as that
Flow'r never chang'd; &s;o it became them not to vary in their Re&s;olutions.
After a long and tedious &s;tay, <HI>Mariage</HI> obtain'd &s;ome few impertinent
Alterations in his Patent; and permi&s;&s;ion to make Wine at <HI>Schiras,</HI> as
the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Alterations they both leave the Court; and <HI>Mariage</HI>
would certainly have accompany'd <HI>Lalin,</HI> who had an intention to &s;ee
<HI>Ardevil, Tauris,</HI> and <HI>Kom,</HI> had he not been &s;olicited to return to <HI>Zul|pha,</HI>
by a Young <HI>Dalilah,</HI> that had &s;mitten his heart. For by the means
of an old Woman, the Mother of one of his Lacqueys, he had de|bauch'd
a young <HI>Armenian</HI> Virgin, whom he kept privately to him&s;elf;
yet not &s;o privately, but the noi&s;e thereof was quickly &s;pread all over
<HI>Zulpha.</HI> All the <HI>Armenians</HI> were &s;candaliz'd at it, and &s;ent to &s;eize the
Baud, to puni&s;h her, by their Laws, as &s;he de&s;erv'd. <HI>Mariage</HI> adver|tiz'd
thereof, flew out of his Lodging to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to protect
her from Ju&s;tice. But &s;eeing the People in an uproar, and finding the
Stones to flye too thick about his Ears, he was forc'd to mind his own
&s;afety, and to &s;eek for &s;helter in the next Hou&s;e where he could be ad|mitted.
But the Bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;o put up, for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> won|dring
to &s;ee that a Deputy of an Illu&s;trious Company, who was come
to the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> upon &s;o &s;erious an Affair, &s;hould do &s;o much wrong
to his Nation, by publickly appearing in &s;o &s;hameful an Action, and &s;o
unworthy of a Per&s;on in public Employment, that they re&s;olv'd to pro&s;e|cute
him all manner of ways. They were re&s;olv'd, to that end, to have
&s;ent into <HI>France</HI> an Expre&s;s, to have Complain'd to the King of his ill
Management and bad Behaviour. But <HI>Mariage</HI> at length re&s;tor'd the
<HI>Armenian</HI> Girl which he had kept clo&s;e lock'd up; after which time the
<HI>Armenians</HI> never look'd upon him but with &s;corn and contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Lalin</HI> being return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> departed thence the <HI>22th</HI> of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI>
1666. for <HI>Bander,</HI> with a Re&s;olution, to Travel into the <HI>Indies.</HI>
But he fell &s;ick at <HI>Bander,</HI> and thinking to return to <HI>Schiras,</HI> for the
Air's &s;ake, he dy'd by the way at a Village call'd <HI>Bend-Ali.</HI> A Gen|tleman
endow'd with noble Qualities, and who&s;e Gentile and Generous
behaviour was an honour to his Nation.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth of the &s;ame <HI>November, Mariage</HI> al&s;o left <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and
departed for <HI>Bander,</HI> with one Father <HI>Mercier,</HI> a <HI>Je&s;uite,</HI> whom he
took along with him as his Almoner, and <HI>Lewis L'E&s;toile,</HI> his <HI>Kalmachi,</HI>
or Interpreter: There he &s;tay'd four Months for the arrival of the Ships,
but none coming, and the heats encrea&s;ing, he re&s;olv'd to &s;pend the
re&s;t of the Year at <HI>Schiras.</HI> As for the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> and young <HI>L' E&s;toile,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="86">
becau&s;e there was no Conver&s;e but with the people of the Country,
they return'd back to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Suratte</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> 1666. Being
come to the <HI>Bar,</HI> they &s;ent to Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e,</HI> chief of the Mi&s;&s;ion of
the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> who pre&s;ently attended them with a Sloop, which he
had obtain'd of the Governour, and brought them home to the <HI>Capu|chin</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, where they &s;tay'd till they departed for <HI>Agra.</HI> Some|time
before was arriv'd there a Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who had run him|&s;elf
out at heels, and of a <HI>Maronite</HI> Chri&s;tian was become a <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick, in hopes to patch up his broken Fortune, being in truth a
meer Counterfeit, and a Hypocrite: For the&s;e <HI>Levantine</HI> Chri&s;tians
&s;eldom change their Religion, but upon &s;ome motive of Intere&s;t; and
when they have got a good Sum together, they pre&s;ently whip back
again into their own Country, and for a &s;mall piece of Money obtain
ab&s;olution of their Patriarch. Thus &s;everal of the Religious <HI>Franks</HI>
that travel out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are often deceiv'd, making a great
noi&s;e of their Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Levantines,</HI> when the Conver&s;ion, at
the bottom, is only an outward Conver&s;ion, and a meer piece of Gul|lery.
Among many others that I could relate, I will only mention
one, of a <HI>Franci&s;can,</HI> call'd <HI>Paul Stella,</HI> who coming with 400 Crowns,
or thereabouts, in his Pocket, for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, a <HI>Maronite</HI> &s;melt him
out, and under the pretence of giving him the Honour of his Conver|&s;ion
to the Catholick Religion, never left him till he had &s;uck'd him
dry, and turn'd the Channel of his Money. This <HI>Maronite</HI> Merchant
before mention'd, who&s;e Name was <HI>Chelebi,</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf very zealous
for the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and he had rea&s;on enough; for the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI>
had been very &s;erviceable to him, and had help'd him in his Affairs when
they were at the lowe&s;t ebb. They were overjoy'd at his arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI>
and gave it out immediately that it was he that had given them Money
for the building their Hou&s;e and Church. But when I came to look
over my Accompts, I found that the Money that had pay'd for the
Ground and a good &s;hare of the building, came out of my Pur&s;e;
Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e</HI> having promis'd that I &s;hould be reimburs'd upon my
return to <HI>Paris.</HI> But I never heard more of my Money, nor indeed did
I ever look after it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the <HI>Capuchins</HI> were willing that the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant,
who never had disburs'd a Peny, &s;hould own the Expences of their
Hou&s;e and Church, is this; becau&s;e no <HI>Frangui</HI> Chri&s;tian is permitted
in the <HI>Indies</HI> to enjoy the propriety of Hou&s;es, or to make any reparati|ons
of tho&s;e which they hire, without the leave of the Governour of
the place. Both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Companies are only <HI>Le&s;&s;ees</HI> to
the <HI>Indians;</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> having &s;uffer'd from the Chri&s;tians in &s;eve|ral
places, where under pretence of repairing or adorning certain
Hou&s;es, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by way of propriety, they have &s;o well
fortifi'd them, that when the Governours have come to require any
Duties from them, they have made them good &s;o long, till they have
forc'd the Governours to yield to their demands.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Deputies were landed at <HI>Surat,</HI> they pre&s;ently &s;pread
abroad a report, that there were &s;even or eight Ships belonging to the
<HI>French</HI> Company that would &s;uddainly follow them. The <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant
was overjoy'd to hear the News, and was in great hopes, that by the
favour of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and the advantage which he had of &s;peaking
<PB N="38" REF="87">
&s;everal of the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Languages, that the greate&s;t part of the <HI>French</HI>
Merchandize would pa&s;s through his hands. Upon the&s;e hopes he
made great Treats, and pre&s;ented large Pre&s;ents to the Deputies, and
maintain'd their Servants at his own Charges. He found the De|puties
to be &s;ufficiently covetous, but he was &s;till in great expectations,
that his civil Entertainments, and the Pre&s;ents which they receiv'd
from him, would oblige them to acknowledge his kindne&s;s, and that
one day he &s;hould find him&s;elf repay'd by the management of their bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
but he was foully mi&s;taken. For it co&s;t him above 1500 <HI>Rupies,</HI>
part which he &s;pent upon them him&s;elf at <HI>Surat,</HI> and partly what his
Nephew furni&s;h'd them withall at <HI>Agra</HI> for their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Three or four days after their arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident &s;ent
to vi&s;it them by &s;ome of his Council, and would have waited on them
him&s;elf, but that he lay then ill of the Gout. The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander
did the &s;ame with his Council, &s;hewing all the civilities and kindne&s;&s;es
that lay in his power; and a few days after invited them &s;olemnly to a
great Fea&s;t, with as many as they could bring along with them. In
the mid&s;t of their Jollity the King's Health was &s;ent about, and after
that, the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>French</HI> Company; which oblig'd <HI>Boulaye</HI> to
begin another Health to the happy Progre&s;s of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company.
But when it came to Mr. <HI>Beber</HI>'s turn to drink it, notwith&s;tanding all
that <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Company could &s;ay to him, they
could not oblige him to pledge it. Nay, he did wor&s;e then this, for
he threw the Gla&s;s, Wine, and all at his Feet; and when he had &s;o
done, he ro&s;e in a heat from the Table, and after a pitiful manner left
the Company, and went home to his Lodging, though without any
attendance. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;o di&s;creet as to take little notice of
his folly, but remain'd very merry at the Table with Mr. <HI>Boulaye</HI> till
Midnight. But they could not forbear telling their Friends, that they
wonder'd, in regard there were &s;o many di&s;creet and ingenious Men in
<HI>France,</HI> that the Company &s;hould make choice of &s;uch a Fool for the
management of &s;uch an important Affair as he was &s;ent about; and
that they fore&s;aw he would do the Company no &s;mall injury.</P>
<P>While the Deputies &s;tay'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> the Governour of the place, at
the reque&s;t of Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e,</HI> entertain'd them, and &s;hew'd them all
the re&s;pect that could be &s;hew'd to Strangers. One day that they were
in Di&s;cour&s;e together, he told them, that if they would follow his
Coun&s;el, he adviz'd them not to go to Court till their Ships were
arriv'd. But &s;eeing that they were re&s;olv'd to the contrary, he offer'd
them Money, Hor&s;es, and Souldiers, to attend them, with Letters
of Recommendation to &s;ome of the Grandees of the Court. The <HI>Cha|bander,</HI>
or Provo&s;t of Merchants, made them the &s;ame offers that the
Governour had done; all which they refus'd very ob&s;tinately. More
then this, they behav'd them&s;elves very ill, in reference to the Pre&s;ents
which the Governour and the <HI>Cha-Bander</HI> &s;ent them, for they gave
their Servants that carry'd them not a <HI>Doight,</HI> which is look'd upon as a
very dirty action in the <HI>Indies.</HI> For the <HI>Indians</HI> never give their Ser|vants
any other Wages, then what they get by carrying Pre&s;ents from
their Ma&s;ters. And the more they have given them, the more Honour
it is, both for him that receives, and him that &s;ends the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Deputies then being re&s;olv'd for <HI>Agra,</HI> hir'd their Waynes, and
their Oxen to carry their Luggage, and five and twenty Souldiers for
<PB N="39" REF="87">
their Convoy. They likewi&s;e made a great noi&s;e, of their being
honour'd from &s;o Great a King, and &s;o Noble a Company. Upon
which &s;core, they ought to have had five or &s;ix Wains for their Baggage,
every one their <HI>Pallaquin</HI> and a Led-hor&s;e, and every one a Flag with
their Arms or their Cyphers, which is the gentile way of Travelling
in <HI>India,</HI> and as I was always wont to travel. But they took but
five and twenty Souldiers, whereas they ought to have hir'd an hundred
and fifty at the rate they talk'd.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of &s;o doing, three Days Journey from <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> began
to quarrel with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> that they had too great a Train at their heels,
for which he blam'd the Advi&s;e of Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e</HI> and the Merchant
of <HI>Aleppo:</HI> That for his part he would pay for no more than four
Souldiers, and that if he would not &s;end the re&s;t back, he &s;hould pay
them him&s;elf. Upon which, they agreed to &s;end back the &s;ix Souldiers
which the Governour had order'd to attend them as far as <HI>Brampour;</HI>
upon their di&s;mi&s;&s;ment, not giving them &s;o much as the Worth of a
Pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Chelebi,</HI> the <HI>Aleppo</HI>
Merchant, fail'd not to wait upon them, and to offer them his &s;ervice.
There was at that time a <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon, who&s;e Name was <HI>James,</HI>
he &s;pake good <HI>Indian,</HI> and was married in the Country to the Daughter
of a <HI>Portugal:</HI> The <HI>Nahab,</HI> the King's Uncle and Grand Vizier, had a
great kindne&s;s for this Chirurgeon; and by his procurement it was,
that the Deputies had Audience of <HI>Giafer-Kan,</HI> for &s;o was the <HI>Nahab</HI>
call'd. They reque&s;ted of him, that by his favour they might pre&s;ent
a Letter from their King to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> as al&s;o that they might
be admitted to treat concerning the Settlement of a <HI>French</HI> Trade in the
Countrey. The <HI>Nahab</HI> told them, that he would &s;peak to the King,
and take care that they &s;hould be admitted to their Audience in a little
time. With that he order'd them to be conducted to the Lodgings
appointed for them, which they found ready furni&s;h'd with all nece&s;&s;ary
provi&s;ion for the Belly; but their Lacqueys and Servants were to cook
it them&s;elves; for it is not here as it is in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the Meat is &s;ent
ready dre&s;t out of the King's Kitchin to the Emba&s;&s;adors Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nahab,</HI> who under&s;tood that they had brought no Pre&s;ents,
neither for him, nor any of the Grandees of the Court, nor for
the King him&s;elf, was not over ha&s;ty to admit them to their Audience.
So that it was above a Month before the Deputies could &s;et Eyes upon
the <HI>Nahab</HI> again, though the Chirurgeon, and other <HI>Franguis,</HI> us'd all
their Intere&s;t in their behalf. Being very weary of this Delay, they
gave it out, that they could &s;tay no longer at <HI>Agra,</HI> in regard they
were to be at <HI>Surat</HI> upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els. Upon
which fal&s;e Report, the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent to them for the King their Ma&s;ter's
Letter, that he might pre&s;ent it to the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> him&s;elf. Upon this
Demand of their Letter, they were quite blank, not being acquainted
with the manner how the Kings of <HI>India</HI> receive tho&s;e Letters which
are brought them by Emba&s;&s;adors: For they never receive any with
their own hands, but &s;uch as come from the <HI>Grand Signior:</HI> All other
Letters, according to the Grandeur of the Kings that &s;end them, are
put into the hands of the Grand Officers of the Court, who pre&s;ent
them to the King: And the more potent the King is, from whom the
Letter comes, through the fewer hands it pa&s;&s;es before it is pre&s;ented
<PB N="40" REF="88">
to the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI> For the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is very
well known in the Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the Difference
between the Soveraigns of both, in reference to their Grandeur and
Pui&s;&s;ance. Neither is there a Stranger that enters into the Kingdom,
of whom the Governour of the Frontier Province does not give advice
to the <HI>Nahab;</HI> and if he appear to be a per&s;on of Ingenuity, there's
no help for't, but he mu&s;t go to Court, where he is care&s;s'd, on
purpo&s;e to get information of the Country from whence he comes.</P>
<P>But to return to the Deputies, they ob&s;tinately refu&s;'d to &s;end the
Letter to the <HI>Nahab:</HI> At which he was not a little troubl'd; fearing le&s;t
upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, it might be the occa&s;ion of a
Rupture, and hinder the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty of Commerce.
Moreover he was not a little jealous, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eize upon the
<HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;els in their Voyage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> as <HI>Hugh Lambert</HI> the
<HI>Holland</HI> Pyrat did, who took all the Baggage belonging to the Queen
of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> when &s;he was going to <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina.</HI> The <HI>Nahab</HI>
having made the&s;e Reflexions to him&s;elf, &s;o wrought with the King,
that he con&s;ented that the Deputies, contrary to cu&s;tom, &s;hould be
admitted into his pre&s;ence, there to give the Letter into the Hands of
the Prime Mini&s;ter, to be by him pre&s;ented to the King. This, as I &s;aid
before, was an unu&s;ual favour; and yet the Deputies were &s;o ob&s;tinate,
as to reject this Propo&s;ition, &s;aying, that they would rather return
home, and carry back their Letters, then not pre&s;ent them to the King
them&s;elves. This ob&s;tinacy of theirs, to maintain their own conceited
humour again&s;t the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey, was very much blam'd
by all people, that admir'd at the patience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at
length &s;ent them word, they might take their own cour&s;e, &s;ince they
refu&s;'d the Honours which he would have done them. After that,
the Deputies &s;taid ten or twelve days in the City, flattering them&s;elves,
that the <HI>Nahab</HI> would comply with their Folly; but they were deceiv'd.
For the <HI>Nahab</HI> offended at their idle carriage, took &s;uch order, that
not one per&s;on living, either Merchant or other, went to vi&s;it them
all the while. So that they re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> in expectation
of their Ships.</P>
<P>When they left <HI>Agra,</HI> they went and lay two Leagues off from the
City in the Field, &s;etting up one Tent apiece, (and tho&s;e pitiful ones
Heaven knows) to &s;erve for them and their Servants, whereas they
might have lodg'd with more &s;ecurity in a fair Inn that &s;tood not far
off. Now it is the Cu&s;tom at the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Court, that every
Night &s;ome Prince or great Lord keeps Guard in his turn for a Week
together, having under him five or &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e, that beat the
Road for three or four Leagues round the place where the King quarters.
A Party of the&s;e Hor&s;emen &s;couting by the Deputies Tents, and
enquiring who&s;e they were, one of the Servants reply'd, that they were
the Tents of the <HI>French</HI> Deputies: of which the Hor&s;emen gave
immediate notice to their Captain, at that time the Grand Provo&s;t of
the Empire. A Per&s;on hand&s;om, well endow'd, and a great Lover of
Strangers, who had rai&s;'d him&s;elf by his Valour, as being an <HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI>
by Nation. So &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken" EXTENT="1 letter">n as he under&s;tood that they were the <HI>French</HI> Deputies,
he &s;ent one of his principal Officers, with fifty Hor&s;e, to de&s;ire them
to give them leave to guard them that Night, becau&s;e they were in no
&s;ecurity, and for that if they came to any mi&s;chief the Head of their
<PB N="41" REF="88">
Captain mu&s;t an&s;wer for it. But they very ill receiv'd the kind proffer
of the Provo&s;t, proudly an&s;wering, that they were &s;trong enough to
guard them&s;elves, and the fir&s;t that came near them &s;hould know whe|ther
the <HI>French</HI> had Courage or no, adding withal, that if their Captain
were afraid, they would guard him, with a deal of other &s;currilous riffraff
which very much &s;urpriz'd the Officers.</P>
<P>The next day they &s;et up their Tents about a quarter of a League far|ther,
becau&s;e they expected &s;omething to be brought them from <HI>Agra.</HI>
The <HI>Conteval</HI> or Grand Provo&s;t admiring they made &s;uch &s;low journeys,
and that they had now pitch'd in a more dangerous place then before,
&s;ent the &s;ame Hor&s;emen with the &s;ame proffer, or el&s;e that they would
be pleas'd to lye in an Inn where they might be &s;afe. <HI>Boulaye</HI> was of the
mind that &s;o kind an offer &s;hould not be refus'd: but <HI>Beber</HI> gave them
nothing but bad language; reviling their Captain, that he was afraid
they &s;hould go and lye with his wives, offering if he pleas'd to go and
guard them. He &s;poke half Portugue&s;e, half Italian, which being a kind
of <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> &s;ome of the Hor&s;emen made a &s;hift to under&s;tand him,
and having made a report to the Grand Provo&s;t of his In&s;olent An&s;wer,
the Lord was not a little nettl'd at it, and therefore re&s;olv'd to be re|veng'd.
About midnight four&s;core or a hundred Hor&s;e came and cut
all the Cords of <HI>Bebers</HI> Tent, thinking to have let it fall about his ears. But
he found a way to quit him&s;elf by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Servant; and en|deavour'd
to e&s;cape to the Hou&s;e of a <HI>Dervich</HI> on the other &s;ide of a &s;mall
Rivolet, nere the place where the Tents were &s;et up. But the Moon
&s;hining as bright as day, he could not hide him&s;elf from the pur&s;uit of
the Hor&s;emen, who &s;hot at him, and with their Arrows wounded him
in three places, once in the thigh and twice in the buttocks. <HI>Bou|laye</HI>
hearing the noi&s;e which the Hor&s;emen made, peep'd out of his Tent,
and &s;eeing &s;o many Hor&s;emen in pur&s;uit of <HI>Beber,</HI> was not a little daunt|ed.
He was afraid of running the &s;ame <HI>ri&s;co;</HI> but not having long to
con&s;ider, he took his pur&s;e of Duckets, and fled till he got about half a
league off, where he lay all night under a great Tree. But by the con|&s;equence
he found that the Hor&s;emen had nothing to &s;ay to him; being
&s;atisfi'd when they &s;aw <HI>Beber</HI> fall, as believing him dead. For had they
not thought him &s;o, they would never have left him, till they had quite
done his bu&s;ine&s;s. But to colour the bu&s;ine&s;s, that it might not &s;eem
a point of revenge they broke open all <HI>Beber</HI>'s Che&s;ts; that it might &s;eem
as if he had bin robb'd; but they found very little or nothing to enrich
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Beber</HI>'s boy &s;aw that the Hor&s;emen were gone, he ran to the
Town for a <HI>Pallanquin</HI> to carry his Ma&s;ter thither. Being brought to
the Town they laid him in the Je&s;uits hou&s;e, where <HI>Boulaye</HI> al&s;o arriv'd
not long after and took up his Quarters, to the great con&s;olation of the
Je&s;uits, who&s;e Revenues are but &s;mall in tho&s;e parts, where there are
no devout people to leave them Legacies. Their Ordinary was very
&s;paring; but it was &s;uch as the Deputies mu&s;t be glad of. Though it
were a fea&s;t for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who was not wont to make better chear. For a
Sheeps head, of his own purcha&s;e, u&s;ually &s;erv'd him two meals. Which
made him ridiculous to the <HI>Franks,</HI> who liv'd after a more &s;plendid rate.
At <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> when he was not invited by the <HI>Franguis,</HI> he had
recour&s;e to his Sheeps tongues, or a cold piece of double Tripe, which
he carri'd to the poor <HI>Cabaretts</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> taking his Chopin of Wine
<PB N="42" REF="89">
to wa&s;h it down: and &s;uch was his good husbandry that what was left
was order'd to be &s;et up for his &s;upper. One day he had drank a little more
then he had bled, and the <HI>Franguis</HI> found him a &s;leep in the &s;treet, about
a hundred paces from the Cabaret. They had &s;o much charity for him as
to remove him to his lodging, le&s;t other Nations &s;hould laugh at the
choice which they had made of an Envoy to &s;ettle the Trade of &s;uch a
con&s;iderable Company. As for <HI>Beber,</HI> who lov'd good Chear when it
co&s;t him nothing, as being a true exemplar of covetou&s;ne&s;s, he com|plain'd
of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> entertainment, though they out-run the Con&s;table to
treat him like a Deputy. His man who had more wit than he, and plainly
&s;aw what a trouble he was to his Ho&s;ts, made them a merry relation of
the Noble Table which his Ma&s;ter kept for him, how he had made pro|vi&s;ion
of a Barrel of Herrings; which when Invitations fail'd, he wa|rily
fed upon, rubbing his bread with the tail to give it a <HI>haut goust.</HI> For
my part, &s;aid the Boy, I am but a poor Servant, yet I have made a &s;hift
to &s;pend an hundred and fifty Crowns which I had got in the &s;ervice of
the Con&s;ul of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> 'Twas my misfortune to be inveigl'd out of his
&s;ervice, for I was with a Noble Ma&s;ter where I got Money; but in this
man's &s;ervice I have eaten all that I had got before. Two days after I
arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> and heard of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded and where he lay, and
went to give him a vi&s;it. And as I never went unprovided in my travels
with all things nece&s;&s;ary, I had &s;ome Oyntments and Pla&s;ters, which
were very &s;erviceable to him.</P>
<P>It was an ea&s;ie thing to ob&s;erve that <HI>Boulaye</HI> was glad of the opportu|nity
of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded, that he might have the &s;ole honour of
giving the Letter to the King. For he pretended to be the true <HI>Envoy</HI>
from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that <HI>Beber</HI> was only &s;ent to bear him com|pany.
<HI>La Boulaye</HI> therefore believing that the bu&s;ine&s;s would take effect,
per&s;uaded the Chyrurgion already mention'd to &s;olicit the <HI>Nahab</HI> who
had a kindne&s;s for him, &s;o clo&s;e, that thereby the <HI>Nahab</HI> permitted him
to bring the Letter. But <HI>Boulaye</HI> who thought he &s;hould give it him&s;elf
to the King, was much &s;urpriz'd when he &s;aw that the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who had
got the Letter into his own power, gave it to one of the meane&s;t Officers
of his Court, who by the Prime Mini&s;ter's order, gave it to another,
and he to a third, who brought it back to the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at length pre|&s;ented
it to the King, but not in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Boulaye.</HI></P>
<P>And thus you &s;ee the Effect of the ridiculous pride of the Deputies,
<HI>Boulaye</HI> was forc'd to &s;tay in an outer Court, having two more to pa&s;s
thorough before he came into the King's Quarter. Where, while he re|main'd
big with expectation, word was brought him, that the King
would return an An&s;wer to the King his Ma&s;ter, &s;o &s;oon as the Ships
&s;hould be arriv'd; and &s;o he was forc'd to go back to his Lodging with
the melancholy di&s;&s;atisfaction of a fru&s;trate hope.</P>
<P>The wounded Gentleman being new cur'd, but &s;till very lame, de|&s;ir'd
Audience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> that he might have ju&s;tice for the mi&s;|chief
done him by an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and a Robbery. The <HI>Nahab</HI> readily
admitted him, limping when he came into his pre&s;ence wor&s;e then
when he fir&s;t left his bed. The fir&s;t Compliment he made was of the
Wounds he had receiv'd, and then he demanded &s;atisfaction for the lo&s;s
of his Blood, and the Goods which had bin &s;tolen from him. The <HI>Na|hab</HI>
promis'd him to inform the King of the bu&s;ine&s;s, a&s;&s;uring him that
he &s;hould have no wrong done him upon the high-way within the Ter|ritories
<PB N="43" REF="89">
where he had to do. Four or five days after, the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent to
<HI>Beber</HI> to know how much the Lo&s;s which he pretended to have receiv'd
amounted to. <HI>Beber</HI> brought in an account of four and twenty thou&s;and
<HI>Roupies,</HI> or 12000 Crowns, and for the lo&s;s of his Blood, he left it to the
Kings Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>His Accompt he made out thus:</P>
<P><HI>Imprimis.</HI> A Note for the value of &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> which he had
lent a Merchant when he departed for <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> which Note was among
the Papers he had lo&s;t. As to that, the <HI>Nahab</HI> ask'd him whether the No|taries
in <HI>France</HI> did not make an Entry of &s;uch publick Acts as were &s;ign'd
before them&punc; <HI>Beber</HI> made an&s;wer, that he &s;hould never be paid, if he could
not produce the &s;ame Paper that had bin taken from him, and that he
could not demand his Money without it. The <HI>Nahab</HI> replying; that
that was contrary to the Cu&s;tom of all Nations, and that he knew it could
not be as he &s;aid, added withal, that he &s;hould take no care for his &s;atis|faction
in that particular. After that he read on.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Five thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> in Gold and Silver Money.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Four thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> in Gold Lace and Galoon to trim his
Clothes.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Two Diamond Rings at two thou&s;and one hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Two other Rings, a Topaz, and another of &s;ea-green water,
which co&s;t three hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> His Clothes, his Linnen, and for a Che&s;t of Medicaments,
which might be worth 4000 <HI>Roupies;</HI> of which he had procur'd his Chi|rurgeon
to give in a Bill.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> A Chain of Gold valu'd at 500 <HI>Roupies.</HI> In all amounting to 24000
<HI>Roupies,</HI> as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Two or three days after, the King caus'd an Order to be deliver'd to
him for the payment of his Money at the Trea&s;ury-Chamber. Upon
which Order, he agreed with a Merchant to be paid at <HI>Surat.</HI> And when
he was ready to depart, the King commanded 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> to be paid
him for the lo&s;s of his Blood. But that &s;um he never receiv'd. For be|ing
in ha&s;te to be gone to <HI>Surat,</HI> and failing to pre&s;ent the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> he
drill'd him out &s;o long, that his patience was quite tir'd, and &s;o he was
forc'd to go without it.</P>
<P>I could never under&s;tand the Policy of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> to pay <HI>Beber</HI>
the &s;um which he &s;aid had bin taken from him; when the <HI>Nahab</HI> knew
to a thread what he had lo&s;t, and had given in an accompt thereof to the
King; the whole not amounting to 2000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> And as for the <HI>Fran|guis,</HI>
&s;o &s;oon as they under&s;tood that he had demanded 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for
his Chirurgeons Che&s;t, they all cry'd out that it was a meer cheat. For
a few days before <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> the Chirurgeon had receiv'd 200
<HI>Roupies</HI> by the Charity of the <HI>Franks</HI> to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> and he fell &s;ick
the next day that this Bill was pre&s;ented to the <HI>Nahab.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Mogul</HI> had read the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter, the <HI>Nahab</HI> by
order of his Ma&s;ter, order'd a Lodging to be provided for the Deputies,
which overjoy'd the Je&s;uits, who were by that means rid of two very
trouble&s;ome Gue&s;ts. As for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> in regard the King had &s;ignifi'd his
plea&s;ure, that he would not return any an&s;wer to the King's Letter till
the arrival of the Ships, he never troubled him&s;elf any farther&punc; but
&s;taid till the waters were fallen, that he might go to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Golconda</HI> to &s;ettle a Trade in tho&s;e parts. But <HI>Beber</HI> moil'd like
<PB N="44" REF="90">
a hor&s;e, and did nothing but run to and fro, to know the King's plea&s;ure
touching the &s;ettlement of Trade. But the <HI>Nahab</HI> either laugh'd at him,
or took little notice of what he &s;aid. For indeed by <HI>Beber</HI>'s outward
appearance, and deportment, no man could make any other judgment
of him, but that he was a poor &s;pirited fellow, and one that knew not
what it was to live. For all the <HI>Europeans</HI> that travel into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the
<HI>Indies</HI> are always richly habited, nor would any of them keep <HI>Beber</HI>
company, who by his Habit look'd rather like a Footman, than a Depu|ty
of a Royal Company of Trade. At length a whim took him to
make him&s;elf a &s;uit of painted Calicut, after the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion, the
like whereof had never been &s;een in the Country; the whole Suit not
&s;tanding him in above 13 <HI>Livres</HI> and 13 <HI>Sous.</HI> For the trimming of his
new Suit he took off the Ribbands of his old Cloaths, which he was two
days lathering, and &s;moothing with a Taylers Goo&s;e. When he had
got this rare Habit upon his back, he went to vi&s;it the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who was
then attended by the Principal Lords of the Court. Who when they
&s;aw him enter, fell all a gazing upon him, and ask'd one another whe|ther
that <HI>Frangui</HI> were turn'd <HI>Faquir,</HI> or a <HI>Dervich</HI> of <HI>Ho&s;&s;en Mamout,</HI>
which they u&s;ually call the ragged <HI>Saint.</HI> For you mu&s;t know, that all
the <HI>Faquirs</HI> or <HI>Derviches</HI> that are of this Order, never apparel them&s;elves
but with &s;uch rags as they pick up in the &s;treets, and if they meet with
any pieces better than other, they make of them a kind of Galoon to
trim the re&s;t. They al&s;o carry half Pikes, with a great company of
Tatters fa&s;ten'd to the end of them, to make a &s;hew of their beggery. <HI>Be|ber</HI>'s
Habit very much &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Nahab,</HI> and all others that beheld
him &s;o ridiculou&s;ly accouter'd. As he pa&s;s'd one morning by my win|dow,
I bid him good morrow, telling him withal, that he look'd more
&s;pruce and gay than he us'd to do. He reply'd, that he had rea&s;on &s;o to
do, for that he had receiv'd Letters from <HI>Surat,</HI> by which he had advice,
that the Country people upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cape St. John</HI> had decry'd
four Ve&s;&s;els out at Sea, which they could not make to be either <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
or <HI>Hollanders,</HI> from whence he concluded that they were the Companies
&s;hips; and that he was going to the <HI>Nahab</HI> with the News. But I pre|vented
him at that time, telling him that I had often ob&s;erv'd that ra&s;cally
&s;ort of people to come both to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with &s;uch kind of
Intelligence, on purpo&s;e to get Money; when indeed they had never
&s;een any &s;uch &s;ight, and admoni&s;hing him not to believe Reports upon
&s;uch &s;light foundations. I ask'd him what date his Letters bore? he
told me, thirty days ago. Then, &s;aid I, if the di&s;covery had bin true,
the <HI>Nahab</HI> would have had notice of it in fourteen; and then he would
certainly have told you of it, or my &s;elf; for it is but two days &s;ince I took
my leave of him. Thereupon he took my coun&s;el and re&s;olv'd for <HI>Surat</HI>
in a few days.</P>
<P>Three days after that the Chirurgeon had given in his Bill for the
Che&s;t of Medicaments that he had lo&s;t among <HI>Beber</HI>'s Baggage, he was
&s;o touch'd in Con&s;cience, that he fell &s;ick, and dy'd in two days. Upon
his death-bed he ask'd pardon of God for the Cheat which he had con|&s;ented
to, to ask 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for that which was really worth but four
hundred; 200 of which he had receiv'd from the Charity of the <HI>Fran|guis,</HI>
the re&s;t upon the &s;ale of a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>For my part, finding that <HI>Beber</HI> was re&s;olv'd for <HI>Surat,</HI> I made what
ha&s;t I could out of <HI>Agra,</HI> to be quit of his company. But the &s;econd
<PB N="45" REF="90">
day after my departure, having &s;et up my tent by a Rivers &s;ide, ju&s;t as I
was going to dinner I &s;py'd <HI>Beber</HI> coming, nor could I get rid of him
afterwards till I came to <HI>Surat.</HI> So that we were forc'd to travel toge|ther,
though he committed a thou&s;and Impertinencies by the way.
Among the re&s;t, he put one trick upon the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> or
Bankers at <HI>Brampour,</HI> not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>In regard the ways were bad, and that he had but one pitiful weak
Chariot, and four weak Boys, which with the help of Oxen, were
hardly &s;trong enough to help him out when he &s;tuck in the mire, he &s;el|dom
came to his journeys end till two or three hours after me. Now upon
the report that ran of the <HI>French</HI> &s;hips being &s;een out at Sea&punc; and
the general belief that <HI>Beber</HI> would be one of the Principal Tru&s;tees
of the Company, &s;everal, as I &s;aid before, courted him, and &s;ought to
engage his Friend&s;hip. Being arriv'd at <HI>Brampour,</HI> the Chief of the
<HI>Cheraffs,</HI> attended by a dozen of his &s;ervants came to vi&s;it us. Upon the
fir&s;t acquaintance <HI>Beber</HI> told him that he wanted a <HI>Pallaquin</HI> to go to <HI>Su|rat,</HI>
whereupon the <HI>Cheraff</HI> civilly offered him his, and caus'd it to be
trimm'd up for his better accommodation. <HI>Beber</HI> thought that trimming
would have bin fini&s;ht in one day, when indeed it requir'd three or four.
The next day I order'd my Coach to be got ready, and order'd my <HI>Pal|laquin</HI>
to be carri'd away. <HI>Beber,</HI> who verily believ'd that the Compa|ny's
&s;hips were already in the Road of <HI>Surat,</HI> began to cur&s;e and bann
the <HI>Cheraff,</HI> who pre&s;ently came to him and endeavour'd to appea&s;e him
with good words. He told him, it could be no prejudice to him to &s;tay
a day or two; for by that time the Roads would be better, and he might
travel the fa&s;ter. But <HI>Beber,</HI> being tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, was &s;o
far from taking the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> rea&s;ons for &s;atisfaction, that &s;natching a
Cudgel out of his Waggoners hands that &s;tood next to him, he gave
the <HI>Cheraff</HI> three or four good Licks cro&s;s the &s;houlders. The Merchants
and other people that were in the Inn, were &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd at &s;uch a
piece of rudene&s;s, and ran out pre&s;ently, &s;ome with Stones, and others
with Cudgels, making a hideous noi&s;e, and crying out, that they had
never &s;een the like. They took it for a mo&s;t enormous Crime, to &s;trike
the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs,</HI> above four&s;core years old, who&s;e very age
ought to have bin protection enough from &s;uch an Affront. Good luck
it was for <HI>Beber,</HI> after &s;uch a ra&s;h action committed, that I was well
known at <HI>Brampour,</HI> having been there ten or twelve times, and in &s;ome
of my Travels having dealt for above 200000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> There were
none of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> with whom I had not dealt by Letters of Exchange,
and very few Merchants or Brokers who had not had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s or
other upon my accompt. They cry'd out, &s;peaking of me; See there the
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Franqui,</HI> with whom we have dealt &s;o often, yet never heard
him give us an ill word. Another good chance he had to meet there
the <HI>Coutevall</HI>'s Lieutenant, and three Merchants of <HI>Surat;</HI> and thus be|tween
us, having di&s;ingag'd <HI>Beber</HI> out of the Brabble wherein he had
&s;o &s;illily bemir'd him&s;elf, we made him get into my Coach, and &s;o packt
him out of the City. I follow'd him two hours after: for had he &s;taid
longer in <HI>Brampour,</HI> I believe the <HI>Faquirs</HI> and <HI>Derviches</HI> would have beat
out his brains. For he was no &s;ooner gone, but a great number of that
&s;ort of rabble came to the Inn, crying out, Where was that Dog of a
<HI>Cafer</HI> that had beaten the <HI>Cheraff.</HI> Thereupon, &s;eeing the Multitude
encrea&s;e, I &s;tole out of the Town, without &s;aying a word, and rid on
<PB N="46" REF="91">
till I got three leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> to an old Town call'd <HI>Badelpoura,</HI>
where I overtook <HI>Beber,</HI> who had hir'd a Coach made after the fa&s;hion
of the Country. It was but rea&s;on, that I &s;hould have my own Coach
to &s;leep in in the night: For though in all places where you come to lye
in the night, the <HI>Indians</HI> will offer you a little bed to lye on, yet in re|gard
the rains were but ju&s;t over, the bed&s;teads were &s;o full of Puhies,
that there was no re&s;ting. The&s;e Punies are ingender'd by the moi&s;ture
which the rains, that fall for four months together, cau&s;e in tho&s;e Coun|tries.
Which being over, and the Sun recovering its wonted heat, the
women carry forth their beds every morning, and beating them, well
with good big &s;ticks, never leave till the Punies fall to the ground, and
there turning up their bellies pre&s;ently dye. The&s;e beds con&s;i&s;t of four
feet and four round &s;tayes, as broad and as long as you plea&s;e. To the
&s;taves are fa&s;ten'd girths about four fingers broad, which are much more
commodious than the bottoms of our beds that are plank'd with Deal
or other wood. Over the girths they only lay a &s;ingle Coverlet or
Sheet, which is a manner of lying ea&s;ie enough, con&s;idering the heat of
the Country.</P>
<P>The fourth day after our departure from <HI>Brampour,</HI> being near a great
Town call'd <HI>Semqueles,</HI> in a flat Country, we perceiv'd all the Plain co|ver'd
with Tents. It appear'd to be the Camp of one of the chief <HI>Kans,</HI>
or Lords, whom the <HI>Great Mogull</HI> had &s;ent with 50000 men again&s;t the
Rebel <HI>Raja Sevagi.</HI> This Lord, under&s;tanding who we were, very ci|villy
&s;ent us Melons, and Mango's, and bid his Officers tell us withal,
that we were out of all danger, and might &s;afely pur&s;ue our journey.
Whatever I could &s;ay to <HI>Beber,</HI> to per&s;wade him that it was but an act
of civility and good manners, to wait upon the Prince, I could by no
means engage him. I &s;eeing his impertinency, &s;hifted my habit, and
&s;ent one of my &s;ervants to the Camp, to learn whether the <HI>Kan</HI> drank
Wine; and under&s;tanding that he did, I took a bottle of <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and
another of <HI>Schirus</HI> Wine, and a &s;mall pocket Pi&s;tol delicately embel|li&s;h'd
with &s;ilver; and with this &s;mall Pre&s;ent away I went to wait upon
the General. Being come into his Pre&s;ence, I excus'd <HI>Beber,</HI> as not
being well, and immediately pre&s;ented him the little Pi&s;tol, which he
took, and bid me charge, being de&s;irous to try it. After he had &s;hot it
off, &s;aid he to his Lords that &s;tood by, Now mu&s;t we confe&s;s the&s;e <HI>Fran|qui's</HI>
to be ingenious. This man &s;ees that I am going to the Wars, and
pre&s;ents me wherewithal to de&s;end my life. Then ca&s;ting his eyes
upon the little Hamper, where the Bottles were, he ask'd what it was?
They told him in his Ear. Oh, &s;aid he, looking at the &s;ame time upon
two or three <HI>Mim Bachi's,</HI> or Colonels that were pre&s;ent, This <HI>Franqui</HI>
Gentleman has given me a bottle of Wine, well we mu&s;t drink it;
for I find I &s;hall plea&s;e him in &s;o doing. When the <HI>Mollah's</HI> heard him
talk of Wine, they &s;lunk away; which made the <HI>Kan</HI> laugh heartily.
The&s;e are <HI>Agi's,</HI> quoth he; they have bin Pilgrims to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and never
drink Wine after they come home again. Having taken my leave, he
&s;ent me a <HI>Pomere,</HI> which is a kind of Scarf that may al&s;o &s;erve for a
Girdle. It was made of white Sattin with flow'rs of Gold, and might
be worth about a hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI> He that brought it, told me, I
&s;hould do the <HI>Kan</HI> a great kindne&s;s, to &s;end him another bottle of Wine:
thereupon I &s;ent him two of three, which was all my &s;tore. He &s;ent
me &s;ix Hor&s;emen to conduct us three days journey, till we had pa&s;s'd a
<PB N="47" REF="91">
great River that flows from the Mountains of the South, which wa&s;h|ing
the City of <HI>Baroche,</HI> from whence it takes its Name, falls into the
Bay of <HI>Cambay.</HI></P>
<P>When we came to our la&s;t &s;tage, which is a great Town, call'd <HI>Bar|noli,</HI>
from whence it is but 14 Leagues to <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> &s;ent one of his
Hirelings to give notice thereof to Father <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI> When the News
came, the Father went with the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant, often already men|tion'd,
to borrow the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident's Coaches: and there were about
15 or 16 more Coaches all in a train, with &s;everal Hor&s;emen and Mer|chant
<HI>Banians</HI> that made ha&s;t to meet the Deputy. This happen'd
upon the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> 1666. They carri'd with them Provi&s;ion
enough to make merry, and every <HI>Banian</HI> had his Pre&s;ent ready. For
my part, I as &s;oon as I had &s;aluted the Father Capuchin, I went directly
to my Lodging, where I had left two Servants to take care of a Sum of
Money which I had receiv'd of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> unwilling to hazard
it upon the Road. For in whatever part of the <HI>Indies</HI> I came, I had
credit enough to buy without Money. I only gave my Bills for payment
at <HI>Agra, Vi&s;apour, Golconda,</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> where I generally left my Money,
as having receiv'd it there for the mo&s;t part of the Lords or Kings of the
Country.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Beber,</HI> he was no Changeling, the follies that he committed
are too numerous to be related: but how he began the year 1667, is not
to be omitted.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> upon his return from <HI>Madra&s;patan</HI> and <HI>Golconda,</HI> lodg'd
in the Capuchins hou&s;e. <HI>Beber</HI> going to vi&s;it him, told him, that the
Capuchins were the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Spies, and that he had often advis'd
Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> to break with them, and not to go any more to their
Hou&s;e. That while he frequented their Society, the <HI>French</HI> Company
would be &s;ure to find &s;ome ob&s;tacle in their Trade when the Ships &s;hould
arrive; and that if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had not been at <HI>Agra,</HI> they might have
done what they pleas'd with the King. That the hundred thou&s;and
<HI>Roupies</HI> which they had pre&s;ented to the King and Grandees of the Court,
had hinder'd them from obtaining what they de&s;ign'd. By which it
appear'd, he under&s;tood not the humour of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> for they are
not &s;o liberal: nor would all their tricks, or pre&s;ents have any thing
avail'd them, the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> being de&s;irous that all Nations &s;hould be
welcome to his Dominions, e&s;pecially Merchants, as well they that
import little, as they that bring in much. M. <HI>Thevenot</HI> told him, that
he had never ob&s;erv'd &s;o much of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in all his travels; for if
it were true, that they had &s;uch a de&s;ire to hinder the Trade of other
Nations, they would not afford them pa&s;&s;age in their Ships, or to put
their Goods aboard, as they often did. Moreover, they &s;end away many
times one or two Ships according to the quantity, laden all with &s;tran|gers
Goods, from <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> in which Ships, there is not oft|times
&s;o much as one Bale belonging to the Company. And this, added
he, is farther ob&s;ervable, That they afford their Freight cheaper then
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or any other Nation, who have Ships in the&s;e parts. Thus
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> endeavour'd to convince M. <HI>Beber;</HI> who would have
had Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> have fallen out with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But he knew
better things then to di&s;oblige per&s;ons to whom he was &s;o much behold|ing
as he was every day. For every week they allow'd the hou&s;e a
certain quantity of Bread and Meat, and upon Fa&s;t-days &s;ent them Fi&s;h,
<PB N="48" REF="92">
Eggs, Brandy, and Wine, which were no &s;uch unkindne&s;&s;es to be
quarrell'd with. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> at the &s;ame time told <HI>Beber,</HI> that
he &s;hould do well to repay Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> the Money which he had
borrow'd to pay for the Coach which he had broken to &s;erve him, as
al&s;o that which he had given the Seamen, for trying if they could
di&s;cover the <HI>Companies</HI> Ve&s;&s;els upon the Coa&s;t. But he turn'd his deaf
ear to that di&s;cour&s;e, and would never be per&s;uaded to reimbur&s;e the
Money which Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> laid out for him. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI>
perceiving his unwillingne&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ing him to do things hand&s;omly,
put him into &s;uch a cha&s;e, that he fell a &s;wearing after &s;uch a violent rate,
in a Parlour, that was parted only by a thin board from the place where
the Ma&s;s was &s;aid, that one of the Fryers, ju&s;t ready to go to the Altar,
came forth to de&s;ire him to leave his bla&s;pheming. But <HI>Beber</HI>'s in&s;olence
took his admonition &s;o ill, that he very rudely beat the Fryer in Mr. <HI>The|venot</HI>'s
pre&s;ence; &s;wearing, That had it not been out of re&s;pect to him,
he would have knockt him o' the head. The Capuchin being &s;o inju|riou&s;ly
us'd, came to Me, being hardly able to &s;tir his neck, by rea&s;on
of one of the blows that <HI>Beber</HI> had given him. I chaft his neck with
Oyl of Coco's, and wrapt it up warm: but we dur&s;t not &s;peak a word
of <HI>Beber</HI>'s idle action, for fear of expo&s;ing our &s;elves to the laughter of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who would have made good &s;port with it.
Be&s;ides the&s;e Enormities, he put away his Servant that had &s;av'd his
Life, and kept his Wages. After that he went to lye at an Apothe|caries
hou&s;e, who&s;e Name was <HI>Mouillon,</HI> who came from <HI>Goa,</HI> with a
good quantity of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, and kept a Tavern at <HI>Surat.</HI> While
he lay there he had a great Conte&s;t with the Merchant, who receiv'd
the 24000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> which the King had given him for the lo&s;s which he
alleadg'd that he and his Chyrurgeon had &s;u&s;tain'd. For the Merchant
would acknowledge the receipt of no more then 23900 <HI>Roupies,</HI> the
other Hundred being deducted for Fees of the Trea&s;ury. He al&s;o main|tain'd,
That the Merchant had receiv'd the 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which the King
had allow'd him for the lo&s;s of his Blood: but it was known that the
Grand Trea&s;urer would never pay that Money. Thus when he &s;aw that
his Cheats were di&s;cover'd to all the World, he began to bethink him|&s;elf
how to get away: and we ob&s;erv'd, that he would fain have quitted
<HI>Surat</HI> without noi&s;e. But there is &s;uch good Order taken both by Land
and Sea, that no per&s;on can go away without the knowledge and leave
of the Governour. For as the Countrymen that come from the other
&s;ide of the water cannot return unle&s;s they &s;hew a mark in their hands
made with red Earth at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; neither Hor&s;e nor Coach
can &s;tir without a Note from the <HI>Chabander,</HI> and another for the <HI>Ra|dars,</HI>
who lye &s;ometimes two or three Leagues from the Town. <HI>Beber</HI>
neverthele&s;s had &s;ome a&s;&s;urance from his Vintner, that he might get
into a Boat, by bidding the Boatmen carry him to <HI>Reynel,</HI> a large Town
on the other &s;ide of the water. The Ma&s;ter of the Boat ask'd him for
his Ticket, but <HI>Beber</HI> an&s;wer'd him with his Cudgel, forcing him for|ward,
and telling him, he was not to demand Billets of &s;uch a per&s;on as
he was. As he was got half way the River a great number of Souldiers
hollow'd after the Boatmen, to row the Strangers back a&s;hoar. But
<HI>Beber</HI> laid his hand upon his Sword, and compell'd the Boatmen to go
forward. That evening, <HI>Beber</HI> being return'd, the poor Boatmen were
apprehended, and ba&s;tinado'd till they were almo&s;t maim'd. The
<PB N="49" REF="92">
people cri'd out, that it was the <HI>Frangui</HI> that ought to be &s;o &s;erv'd, and not
the poor Watermen, who had done nothing but by con&s;traint.</P>
<P>Thus did this Envoy behave him&s;elf both in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> to the
great hindrance of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. Now let us &s;ee what became of
both <HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> after all their Extravagancies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sieur de la Boulaye,</HI> according to the accompt given by the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI>
that were at <HI>Agra,</HI> left the Town five or &s;ix days after my departure.
Knowing I went to <HI>Surat,</HI> he had plaid his game &s;o well with me, that
he got a Hamper of twelve large bottles of Wine for 138 <HI>Roupies,</HI> though
they co&s;t me more, for which he gave me a Note of his hand, that I
have &s;till in my cu&s;tody, to be paid at <HI>Surat,</HI> upon the arrival of the
<HI>French</HI> Companies &s;hips. From thence he travell'd to <HI>Patna,</HI> where he
&s;taid nine or ten days, partly with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> partly with the <HI>Hollan|ders:</HI>
from whence he departed for <HI>Daca,</HI> the Re&s;idence of the Governour
of the Province. The Governour of the Province of <HI>Bengale</HI> was
then the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Uncle, who&s;e name was <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> a potent
Prince, who has always under his Command thirty or forty thou&s;and
men.</P>
<P>At <HI>Patna, Boulaye</HI> had a project, that from thence he might ea&s;ily pa&s;s
into <HI>China,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e he there embarqu'd with &s;ome <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Souldiers, who were going to li&s;t them&s;elves under <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan.</HI> But
after that, to this hour, it never could be certainly known what became
of him: but by all probable conjectures, it is verily believ'd, that the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Souldiers murder'd him and his little Slave, in hopes of &s;ome
good booty. Of the truth whereof, the Ob&s;ervation that follows was
no &s;mall evidence. About a quarter of a mile from <HI>Daca</HI> lies a Town,
where five &s;everal mungrel <HI>Portugal</HI> Officers, belonging to the Gover|nour
of <HI>Bengale,</HI> as Canoneers and Carpenters, and &s;ome of the &s;ame
Nation that &s;erve in the Cavalry of <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan.</HI> There they have al&s;o
a &s;mall Church very well built, where an <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> Fryar officiates, to
whom, about three months after <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s departure from <HI>Patna,</HI> a cer|tain
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> in the Habit of a Souldier, with two more companions,
brought two large Books, the one in <HI>Folio,</HI> and the other in <HI>Quarto</HI> to
&s;ell. The Fryar, who was a mungrel al&s;o, under&s;tood no <HI>Latin;</HI> but
finding them not to be in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language, would have &s;topp'd
the Books as &s;toln from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had not the Souldier been too
&s;trong for him. The&s;e Books were thought to have been <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s;
who, to my knowledge, had two Che&s;ts full, well bound; in reading
whereof he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time. His Avarice was his
Ruine; for had he taken a Bark by him&s;elf, as I did when I went from
<HI>Patna,</HI> and had oblig'd the Watermen to give him good &s;ecurity, he
could have run no hazard. For my part I took one with four and twenty
men; and every one, knowing I never &s;par'd for co&s;t, gave me excellent
&s;ecurity. The&s;e Barks are little Galliots, which will undertake to carry
you to your journey's end, and name your own day. If you will lye
a&s;hoar every evening, they will &s;et up your Tents; and &s;top at any
Town or City to take in Provi&s;ions. I never made &s;o plea&s;ant a Voy|age
in my life, nor with le&s;s trouble. For in the&s;e Barks, there is a
Room where the Sun cannot come in, where you may repo&s;e in the day
time, and &s;it in the cool Air on that &s;ide from whence the Breez comes.
There is another place cover'd for your Kitchin; and another little
Garderobe for the private deeds of Nature. By the way I kill'd great
<PB N="50" REF="93">
&s;tore of large Gee&s;e, Cranes, and Crocodiles, which I gave the Water|men,
who were very glad of them; for they &s;old them in the Towns
as they row'd along. The people in tho&s;e quarters are very good natur'd
and officious. Dyet is little worth, as being the place where you may
buy a hundred Pullets for a Crown: and for three or four Pence, you may
buy a Fi&s;h of a prodigious length and bigne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Beber</HI>'s end was no le&s;s &s;ad. For when the <HI>French</HI> Companies Ships
were arriv'd, M. <HI>Caron,</HI> who commanded them, and M. <HI>Rambos,</HI> with an
<HI>Armenian,</HI> who had the management of the chiefe&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s,
had been acquainted with what had pa&s;s'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> between <HI>Beber</HI> and
the Capuchins. Pre&s;ently Affections and Intere&s;ts parted. <HI>Caron</HI> and
<HI>Rambos</HI> took <HI>Beber</HI>'s part; the <HI>Armenian</HI> held for the Capuchins, which
was at length the ruin of <HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos.</HI> The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander
going aboard to vi&s;it the Sieur <HI>Caron,</HI> upon his return would not permit
the Captain to &s;tir out of his Cabin; &s;o that <HI>Rambos</HI> and the <HI>Armenian</HI>
took upon them to wait upon the Commander. Upon this Occa&s;ion
the <HI>Armenian</HI> took upon him to precede <HI>Rambos,</HI> and briskly threw him|&s;elf
before the <HI>French</HI>-man; who being provok'd at the Affront, gave
the <HI>Armenian</HI> a &s;winging cuff o' the Ear before all the company. To be
&s;hort, the Sieur <HI>Caron, Rambos,</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> holding all together, the <HI>Ar|menian</HI>
found him&s;elf too weak to re&s;i&s;t: and in regard he had the
Management of the Ca&s;h, he was accus'd of Misbehaviour, and was
condemn'd to be hang'd. But becau&s;e they could not execute the Sen|tence
which they had given at <HI>Surat,</HI> they &s;ent him away to the Council
Royal of the I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> of which M. <HI>Mondevergue</HI> was chief;
who was &s;o far from confirming the Sentence given at <HI>Surat,</HI> that he
admitted the <HI>Armenian</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf; and finding that he was not
only innocent, but that he might be very u&s;eful to the Company, he
&s;ent him back to <HI>Surat</HI> with more power then he had before. This put
<HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos</HI> into a fit of De&s;pair, to &s;ee the per&s;on whom they
thought to have ruin'd, now above them. Thereupon they found a
way to get 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> a piece for their Wages, which they pretended
to be due from the Company: and with that and 24000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which
<HI>Beber</HI> had of his own they Embarqu'd both together for <HI>Goa.</HI> Where,
being arriv'd, <HI>Beber</HI> dy'd &s;oon after: But as for <HI>Rambos,</HI> he return'd home
again through <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
TRADE
OF THE
EAST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>_THat Nation which has a de&s;ign to &s;ettle a Trade in the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ure in the fir&s;t place, to po&s;&s;e&s;s
them&s;elves of a convenient place in that Country, to
carine their Ships, and &s;helter them&s;elves during the
tempe&s;tuous Sea&s;ons. This want of a good Haven is
the rea&s;on that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have not made tho&s;e advan|tages
which otherwi&s;e they might have done; becau&s;e
it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould remain in tho&s;e
Seas without being carin'd, or el&s;e eaten by the worms.</P>
<P>Therefore, becau&s;e it is a long way from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> it
would be requi&s;ite to have a retreating place at the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> to
take in fre&s;h Water and Provi&s;ions, whether going or coming; but
e&s;pecially in their return, in regard that the Ships being then laden, can|not
take in Water for any long time.</P>
<P>The Road of the I&s;land of <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have built
a Fort, is a very commodious place: and if the Water be not &s;o good
upon the North-&s;ide, yet the Plain is an excellent &s;pot of Ground to &s;ow,
with convenience of all things nece&s;&s;ary for human &s;upport.</P>
<P>This advantage the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have depriv'd all other Nations
of, by their Forts upon the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> and <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s. And there|fore
&s;ome River's mouth, near the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> ought to be &s;ought
for, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which would be far more convenient then
the <HI>Dauphin I&s;land,</HI> where there is no Trade but that of buying Cattel
for their Hides; which being a Trade of &s;o little con&s;equence, would
ruin a Company to follow it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I make this Propo&s;al is, becau&s;e that in the year 1648,
two <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;els being bound from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and
re&s;olving to touch at the <HI>Cape,</HI> to take in fre&s;h Water, mi&s;took their ju&s;t
Depths, &s;o that the Sea running high, they fell into a Bay, 18 or 20
Leagues from the <HI>Cape,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t that looks to the We&s;t. In that
<PB N="52" REF="94">
Bay they found a River, who&s;e Water was very good; and the Blacks
of the Country brought them Refre&s;hments of all &s;orts of Fowl, Fi&s;h,
and Bullock's fle&s;h. There they &s;taid above 15 days, and before they
&s;et &s;ail, they took two of the <HI>Negro's,</HI> which they carri'd along with
them to <HI>Goa;</HI> to teach them the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language; on purpo&s;e to try
if they could di&s;cover by them any knowledge of the Trade of the
Country. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander at <HI>Surat</HI> de&s;ir'd me, to inform my
&s;elf, when I went to <HI>Goa,</HI> what the <HI>Portugals</HI> had learnt from tho&s;e two
<HI>Negro's.</HI> But one <HI>St. Amand,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ingeneer, who was Supervi&s;or
of the Fortifications of <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, That he could not make them learn
one word of the Language; and that he could only gue&s;s by their &s;igns,
that they had &s;ome knowledge of <HI>Ambergreece</HI> and <HI>Elephants Teeth.</HI>
The <HI>Portugals</HI> however made no que&s;tion but to meet with Gold, if they
could find a way to trade higher up i' the Country. The Revolutions
of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and their Wars with <HI>Spain</HI> have hinder'd them from making
any more particular di&s;covery of the Coa&s;t. Which it were to be wi&s;h'd
the <HI>French</HI> would undertake, provided they gave no cau&s;e of jealou&s;ie to
the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of what they were going about.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t having the liberty
of &s;ome place near <HI>Surat,</HI> to ride &s;afe in, and to wa&s;h and tallow in, in
ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;taid by the Rain-Sea&s;ons. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e
that during that ill &s;ea&s;on, at what time it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep the Seas,
the <HI>Mogul</HI> jealous of his Fortre&s;s of <HI>Surat</HI> &s;uffers no Foreign Ve&s;&s;el in the
River, where neverthele&s;s, the Ships being unladen, may ride &s;ecurely
from the terrible Tempe&s;ts that la&s;t for five Months.</P>
<P>The only &s;ecure place for the Companies Ve&s;&s;els would be the Town
of <HI>Dia,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>The advantage of the &s;ituation is con&s;iderable for &s;everal rea&s;ons.
The circuit of the City contains almo&s;t 400 Hou&s;es, and might be
capable to receive a greater number of people, where the Ships would
find all conveniencies during their &s;tay. It is &s;eated upon the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> upon a point of the Gulph of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> looking toward the
South-ea&s;t. The form of it is almo&s;t round; and above half the Circle
environ'd by the Sea. It is not commanded by any Hill; and the <HI>Por|tugals</HI>
have begun tho&s;e Fortifications, which might be ea&s;ily fini&s;h'd.
It contains &s;everal Wells of very good Water, and a River which falls
into the Sea near the City, who&s;e Water is better then that of <HI>Surat,</HI> or
<HI>Souali,</HI> and the Harbour is very commodious for Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals,</HI> when they had fir&s;t &s;ettl'd them&s;elves in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
kept there a Fleet compos'd of Galleys, Brigantines, and other light
Ve&s;&s;els, whereby they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, for a long time, of all
the Trade of the Places we have treated of. So that no Ship could
trade, without the Governour of <HI>Dia</HI>'s Pa&s;sport, who made it in the Name
of the Viceroy that liv'd at <HI>Goa.</HI> The Impo&s;ition, which the Ships paid,
was &s;ufficient to maintain the Fleet and Garri&s;on, and to enrich the Go|vernour
be&s;ides.</P>
<P>When the Rain-Sea&s;ons are over, that the wind &s;its at North and
North-ea&s;t, you may &s;ail from <HI>Dia</HI> to <HI>Surat</HI> in three or four Tides with
light Ve&s;&s;els; but great Ships that are laden mu&s;t fetch a compa&s;s about
the Bank.</P>
<P>The City has no Land belonging to it, but what it &s;tands upon, yet
it would be no difficult thing to agree with the <HI>Raja,</HI> or Govervour of
<PB N="53" REF="94">
the Province, and to obtain as much as &s;hould be &s;ufficient for the Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Neither is the Land about it very fertile, and be&s;ides, the people are
the poore&s;t in the whole Empire of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the Country
is &s;o well &s;tor'd with Cattel, that an Ox or a <HI>Bufalo</HI> will not co&s;t above
two <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> make u&s;e of the&s;e Cattel to feed their
People, and to &s;pare the Provi&s;ions of their Ships, while they &s;tay at
<HI>Souali.</HI></P>
<P>But it is ob&s;ervable that the <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s fle&s;h in tho&s;e parts cau&s;es frequent
Dy&s;enteries, which the Bullocks fle&s;h or Beef never does.</P>
<P>The <HI>Raja</HI> that commands the Country has only the Title of Governour
for life. Which is common to mo&s;t of the <HI>Raja's</HI> in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Em|pire,
who&s;e Ance&s;tours were Lords of Provinces, where now their
De&s;cendants only enjoy the Titles of Governours.</P>
<P>Having thus got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good Po&s;t; the next thing of Impor|tance
is to choo&s;e out two men con&s;iderable for their Hone&s;ty Prudence,
and Skill in Trade, who are to be allow'd the full of their Expences.</P>
<P>The&s;e two per&s;ons are to &s;erve the Company, the one in the nature
of a Pre&s;ident, with a Council, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of per&s;ons,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The other in the quality of a Broaker, who mu&s;t be an
Idolater of the Country, and not a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> in regard all the Work|men
he has to deal with are Idolaters.</P>
<P>Civility and Faith of Promi&s;e are altogether requi&s;it to gain Credit
among &s;trangers. And the&s;e particular qualities are requir'd in the
particular Broakers, who are under the Broaker-General in the Pro|vinces
where the Factories are &s;ettl'd.</P>
<P>Good Intelligence is nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e two per&s;ons, to under&s;tand
the alteration of Manufactures.</P>
<P>This alteration happens either through the craft and &s;ubtilty of the
Workmen and the Merchants them&s;elves, or by the corre&s;pondence of
the Broakers and Workmen.</P>
<P>Which alteration may cau&s;e &s;o much dammage to the Company, that
the Broakers &s;hall gain ten and twelve i' the hundred by it.</P>
<P>If the Pre&s;ident and Broaker-General combine with the particular
Broakers and Merchants, it will be a difficult thing for the Company to
avoid being deceiv'd; but if the&s;e two per&s;ons are but faithful and hone&s;t,
the fraud may be ea&s;ily remedi'd by changing the particular Broakers.</P>
<P>The Officers of a Company may be unfaithful to their Tru&s;t in this
re&s;pect:</P>
<P>When a Ve&s;&s;el arrives in Port, the Pre&s;ident for the Nation receives
the Company's Letters, and the Bills of Lading; upon which he calls
his Council, &s;ends for the Broaker, and gives him a Copy of the &s;aid
Bills.</P>
<P>The Broaker &s;hews them to three or four of the principal Merchants
of the Country, who are wont to buy by whole &s;ale. If the Pre&s;ident
and the Broaker hold together for their own profit, the Broaker in&s;tead
of facilitating the &s;ale as he ought to do, advi&s;es the Merchants to be
&s;hie, and to offer only &s;uch a price: Then the Pre&s;ident &s;ends for the
Broaker and the&s;e two or three Merchants; and in the pre&s;ence of the
Council he asks the Merchants what they will give for the Goods in
the Bills of Lading mention'd. If the Merchants are re&s;olute to give
<PB N="54" REF="95">
no more then &s;o much; The Pre&s;ident puts off the &s;ale 15 days longer,
more or le&s;s, as he pretends him&s;elf pre&s;s'd to &s;ell. In the mean time
he &s;ends for the Merchants &s;everal times for a &s;hew, and at length, to
avoid &s;u&s;picion, and to di&s;charge him&s;elf, he asks the advice of the
Council, and as they approve, orders the delivery of the Goods to the
Merchant.</P>
<P>But though the Temptations be very great, to which the&s;e two Offi|cers
are &s;ubject, by rea&s;on of their pow'r, their frequent opportunities,
and their di&s;tance from their Superiours, the Company, be&s;ides their
being wary in their Election, may remedy the&s;e di&s;orders by depriving
them of that pretence, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commanders and Broakers
have, of being con&s;train'd to &s;ell off pre&s;ently to the Merchants in gro&s;s,
to avoid the expences of delay.</P>
<P>The Errour which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> commit in this re&s;pect is, That their
Officers be&s;peak every year upon Credit all the Goods which they have
occa&s;ion for in the Empire of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> according to the Orders which
they receive from <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The credit of this Advance co&s;ts them &s;ometimes twelve, &s;ometimes
fifteen <HI>per Cent;</HI> &s;o that &s;o &s;oon as their laden Ve&s;&s;els are arriv'd in the
the Port where they are to be &s;old, they are oblig'd to &s;ell them pre&s;ently
off at the Merchants rate fir&s;t offer'd to their Broakers, to make up a
pre&s;ent &s;tock to pay off their credit for the Goods be&s;poke for their Ships
to carry back again, and to get more credit for the next year. This is
that which cheri&s;hes that confederacy between the Pre&s;ident, the Broaker
and the Merchant, who makes advantage enough of this nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;elling.</P>
<P>Whereas the better way were, for them that carry the &s;ame Commo|dities
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do, to carry Money al&s;o to pay the Work|men
for the Goods be&s;poken for the next year.</P>
<P>The Company making this advantage &s;hall not be put to pay that
great Intere&s;t of 12 and 15 <HI>per Cent.:</HI> and be&s;ides, they &s;hall have better
Goods, and better cheap. The Ships loading &s;hall be ready before they
arrive in Port; and being quick laden they may return before the bad
Sea&s;on. Neither &s;hall the Company be put to &s;ell their Goods at a low
price; becau&s;e their Broakers will have time to &s;tay for the coming of
Merchants from other parts; or el&s;e becau&s;e they have time enough to
&s;end them to other places, where they are &s;ure of a quicker &s;ale.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve al&s;o, That it is far more profitable to carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> Gold
and Silver in Ingots, rather then ready coin'd; for being coin'd the
Money is valu'd only according to their Alloys; and there is always a
defalcation made for the charge of Coinage.</P>
<P>The Broaker al&s;o, if he be di&s;hone&s;t, may combine with the Ma&s;ter
of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Mint, which is &s;ettl'd in &s;everal parts of the Empire, and
put a lower value upon the Gold and Silver then it de&s;erves, by telling
the Pre&s;ident and Council, that upon the touch it appears to be no more
worth.</P>
<P>But it is an ea&s;ie thing to avoid this deceit, provided the Pre&s;ident be
a per&s;on of credit and prudence, by &s;ending for one of the Refiners of
Gold and Silver, that live in the Country, who perfectly under&s;tand the
Touch of Metals, and to let him E&s;&s;ay the Gold and Silver before the
Broaker's face.</P>
<P>This is that which the Sieur <HI>Walkenton</HI> did for the <HI>Holland</HI> Company
<PB N="55" REF="95">
in their Factory at <HI>Ca&s;ambazar,</HI> where he bought every year &s;ix or &s;even
thou&s;and Bales of Silk. For by this E&s;&s;ay he found, that his Broaker
being in confederacy with the Ma&s;ter of the Mint, had cheated the
Company of one and a half and two <HI>per Cent.</HI> in the value of the Gold
and Silver which was brought him from <HI>Japan,</HI> as well coin'd as in barr,
to a very con&s;iderable &s;um of Money.</P>
<P>The Broaker al&s;o may confederate with the Ma&s;ter of the Mint to
couzen the Merchant in weghing his Gold or Silver, by making u&s;e of
fal&s;e Weights or Scales unduly pois'd.</P>
<P>But that fraud is ea&s;ily avoided, if the Pre&s;ident and his Council will
be but &s;o patient as to &s;ee their Metal weigh'd them&s;elves, and take care
that the Weights be right, and the Scales true.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t important Ob&s;ervations in reference to the Trade of
the Company, and di&s;cipline of their Factories is this:</P>
<P>To prevent the Merchants or under-Merchants, Accomptants and
under-Accomptants, who officiate under the Commanders and Broakers,
from driving any particular Trade by them&s;elves, for they having a
familiarity with the men of Manufacture, and finding by the Letters of
Advice what Goods are likely to be mo&s;t vendible next year, buy them up
upon their own accompts, and find a way to lade them off in the Com|pany's
Ve&s;&s;els, to the great dammage of the whole, though to the great
gain of particular people.</P>
<P>And this the Pre&s;ident permits them to do, either for his own In|tere&s;t,
or by connivance under the pretence of their &s;mall Wages. The
Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el al&s;o winks at what they do, becau&s;e he has a &s;pell
for loading and unloading. And becau&s;e the&s;e people having no great
Stocks, are de&s;irous to put off their Goods with the fir&s;t opportunities,
they give order to their Corre&s;pondents to under-&s;ell the Company ten
or twelve in the Hundred, which is the ab&s;olute ruin of a Trade.</P>
<P>To remedy this di&s;order there ought to be a Fi&s;cal, or King's Proctor,
in every of the chief Factories belonging to the Company, to act in the
King's Name, and by his Authority.</P>
<P>He is to be independent from the Pre&s;ident and the Broaker, in the
Exerci&s;e of his Office; &s;o that he may have an eye, as well upon their
behaviour, as upon the demeanour of the under Officers.</P>
<P>He ought to be a per&s;on of good Credit, re&s;olute and vigilant; and
he mu&s;t have a &s;trength of men corre&s;pondent to his Employment, and
a Deputy to act under him.</P>
<P>He is to have good Information of the departure of all Ships when
they are once laden, and when they are ready to &s;et &s;ail for the Port
whither they are bound. When he hears of the Arrival of any Ship,
he ought to go him&s;elf, or &s;end his Deputy with a &s;ufficient Guard, to
take an Accompt of the Ship's Lading.</P>
<P>If it be a place near to which there are any &s;mall I&s;lands, or by-Nooks, it
behoves him to take care that no Goods be privately convey'd a&s;hoar
in tho&s;e private corners, where there are receivers a now ready: and
whatever he finds thus privately unladen he &s;hall have power to con|fi&s;cate.</P>
<P>He &s;hall al&s;o confi&s;cate whatever he finds not Mark'd with the Com|pany's
Mark.</P>
<P>He may al&s;o di&s;charge any inferiour Officers to whom any &s;uch Bales
<PB N="56" REF="96">
&s;hall belong; and for the &s;uperiour Officers, he &s;hall complain of them to
the Company.</P>
<P>He &s;hall have pow'r to open all private Letters, to inform him&s;elf of
Prohibited Goods, and Private Corre&s;pondencies.</P>
<P>This Prohibition of Private Trading cannot be too &s;everely impos'd,
and it is ob&s;erv'd with &s;o much exactne&s;s in <HI>Holland,</HI> that when one of
the Company's Ships is ready to &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a Burgoma&s;ter
gives the Captain and all the re&s;t of the Seamen their Oaths, that they
&s;hall be contented with their Wages, and meddle with nothing of
Trade.</P>
<P>All the Officers of the Factory &s;hould be advanc'd by degrees, &s;o that a
&s;ub-Accomptant may have hopes to be a Pre&s;ident; that the hopes of Ad|vancement
may oblige them to live with more credit, and cau&s;e them to
&s;tudy to make them&s;elves more capable of all the Intrigues and Subtilties
of the Trade of the Country.</P>
<P>It is of great importance not to &s;hew any favour in this particular of
preferment, unle&s;s he have pa&s;s'd through all particular Degrees and
Offices beforehand. And thus much concerning the Di&s;cipline of the
Factories.</P>

There grows al&s;o <HI>Indigo</HI> &s;ome 36 leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> about a great
Village call'd <HI>Raout,</HI> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the
road to <HI>Surat:</HI> Of which the Natives u&s;ually make above a hunder'd-thou&s;and
<HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P>There comes <HI>Indigo</HI> al&s;o from <HI>Bengala,</HI> which the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company
tran&s;ports for <HI>Ma&s;lipatan.</HI> But they buy this <HI>Indigo,</HI> and that of <HI>Brampour</HI>
and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, then that of <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is made of an Herb which they &s;ow every year after the rains are
over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it
three times a year; fir&s;t when it is about two or three foot high; and
they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the fir&s;t cutting far exceeds
the two latter. The &s;econd cutting is wor&s;e then the fir&s;t by ten or
twelve in the hunder'd. And the third wor&s;e then the &s;econd by 12 in the
hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Pa&s;te, and
ob&s;erving the colour. The colour of that <HI>Indigo</HI> which is made of the fir&s;t
cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others:
and that which is made of the &s;econd is more lively then the third.</P>
<P>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they
make with Lime, which becomes &s;o hard, that you would judg it to be
one intire piece of Marble. They are generally four&s;core or a hunder'd
paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up
with the Herb. Then they brui&s;e and jumble it in the water till the leaf,
for the &s;talk is worth nothing, becomes like a kind of thick mud. This
being done, they let it &s;ettle for &s;ome days; and when the &s;etling is all at
the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When
the water is all drain'd out, they fill &s;everal baskets with this &s;lime, and
in a plain Field you &s;hall &s;ee &s;everal men at work, every one at his own
basket, making up little pieces of <HI>Indigo</HI> flat at the bottom, at the top
&s;harp like an egg. Though at <HI>Amadabat</HI> they make their pieces quite flat
like a &s;mall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Mer|chants,
becau&s;e they would not pay cu&s;tom for an unnece&s;&s;ary weight,
before they tran&s;port their <HI>Indigo</HI> out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> are very careful
to cau&s;e it to be &s;ifted, to &s;eparate the du&s;t from it; which they &s;ell
afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They
that &s;ift this <HI>Indigo</HI> mu&s;t be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath before their
faces, and that their no&s;trils be well-&s;topt, leaving only two little holes
for their eyes. Be&s;ides, they mu&s;t every half hour be &s;ure to drink milk,
which is a great pre&s;ervative again&s;t the piercing quality of the du&s;t.
Yet notwith&s;tanding all this caution, they that have &s;ifted <HI>Indigo</HI> for
nine or ten days, &s;hall &s;pit nothing but blew for a good while toge|ther.
Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the &s;i&s;ters, and when I
came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</P>
<P>As they take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in
Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes, they lay them in the Sun to dry.
Which is the rea&s;on that when the Merchants buy <HI>Indigo,</HI> they burn
&s;ome pieces of it, to try whether there be any du&s;t among it. For the
Natives who take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps,
lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Pa&s;te, and fouls it. But when
the Merchants burn it, the <HI>Indigo</HI> turns to A&s;hes, and the Sand remains.

<HEAD>Spice.</HEAD>
<P>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves
and Cinnamon, are all the different &s;orts of Spices known to us.
I put Cardamom and Ginger in the fir&s;t place, becau&s;e that Cardamom
grows in the Territories of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and Ginger in the Dominions of
the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other
Foreign parts to <HI>Surat,</HI> which is the grand Mart.</P>
<P>Cardamom is the mo&s;t excellent of all other Spices, but it is very
&s;carce; and in regard there is no great &s;tore in the place where it grows,
it is only made u&s;e of in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> at the Tables of great Princes. Five
hundred pound of Cardamoms, are pric'd from a hundred to a hundred
and ten Rials.</P>
<P>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where there
grows more than in any other part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and it is hardly to be imagin'd
how much there is tran&s;ported candited into Foreign parts.</P>
<P>Pepper is of two &s;orts. There is a &s;ort which is very &s;mall, another
&s;ort much bigger; both which &s;orts are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into &s;mall and great
Pepper. The larger &s;ort comes from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavare;</HI> and <HI>Tuti|corin</HI>
and <HI>Calicut</HI> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this
Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> being vended
at <HI>Rajapour,</HI> a little City in that Kingdom. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that purcha&s;e
it of the <HI>Malavares,</HI> do not give Money for it, but &s;everal &s;orts of Commo|dities
in Exchange; as Cotten, Opium, Vermilion, and Quick&s;ilver; and
this is the Pepper which is brought into <HI>Europe.</HI> As for the little Pepper
that comes from <HI>Bantam, Afchen,</HI> and &s;ome other parts towards the Ea&s;t,
there is none of it carried out of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where it is &s;pent in va&s;t quantities,
e&s;pecially among the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> For there are double the Grains of
&s;mall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; be&s;ides
that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</P>
<P>The little Pepper that comes to <HI>Surat,</HI> has been &s;old &s;ome years for
thirteen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and &s;o much I have &s;een the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> give for it, to tran&s;port it to <HI>Ormus, Bal&s;ara,</HI> and the Red Sea.
As for the great Pepper, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fetch from the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Malavare,</HI> five hundred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty|eight
Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they

<P>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the
only Spices which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in their own hands. The three fir&s;t
come from the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from
the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="99">
'Tis ob&s;ervable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never
planted, which has been confirm'd to me by &s;everal per&s;ons that have
liv'd &s;everal years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nut|meg
being ripe, &s;everal Birds come from the I&s;lands toward the South,
and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be
dige&s;ted. The Nutmeg then be&s;mear'd with a vi&s;cous matter, falling
to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never
thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one ob&s;ervation
upon the Birds of Paradi&s;e. The&s;e Birds being very greedy after Nut|megs,
come in flights to gorge them&s;elves with the plea&s;ing Spice, at the
&s;ea&s;on, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the &s;trength of the Nutmeg
&s;o intoxicates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the
Emets in a &s;hort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds
of Paradi&s;e are &s;aid to have no Feet; which is not true however, for
I have &s;een three or four that had Feet; and a <HI>French</HI> Merchant &s;ent
one from <HI>Aleppo</HI> as a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of
which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Projects, you may buy Cloves at
<HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> without purcha&s;ing them of the <HI>Hollander;</HI> in regard the I&s;lan|ders
buy them of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains and Soldiers, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
have in tho&s;e places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange
Rice, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;upport of life, without which they
would &s;tarve, being very &s;adly provided for.</P>
<P>When the Natives of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> are thus furni&s;h'd of Cloves, they barter
them in Exchange for &s;uch Commodities as are brought them; &s;ome|times
they give Tortoi&s;e-Shells in exchange, and Gold Du&s;t; by which
the Merchant gains &s;ix or &s;even in the hundred, being better than the
Money of the I&s;land, though it be Gold, by rea&s;on the King oft|times
enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are
<HI>Amboyna, Ellias, Seram,</HI> and <HI>Bouro.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;lands of <HI>Banda</HI> al&s;o, in number &s;ix, <HI>viz. Nero, Lontour, Poulcay,
Ro&s;eguin,</HI> and <HI>Grenapuis,</HI> bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The I&s;land
of <HI>Grenapuis</HI> is about &s;ix Leagues in compa&s;s, and ends in a &s;harp point,
where there is a continual fire burning out of the earth. The I&s;land
<HI>Damme,</HI> where there grows great &s;tore of Nutmegs, and very big, was
di&s;cover'd in the year 1647, by <HI>Abel Ta&s;man,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>The Price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them &s;old to the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Surat,</HI> was as follows.</P>
<P>The Mein of <HI>Surat</HI> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of
our Pounds, at &s;ixteen Ounces to the Pound.</P>
<P>A Mein of Cloves was &s;old for a hundred and three Mamoudi's and
a half.</P>
<P>A Mein of Mace was &s;old for a hundred and fifty-&s;even Mamoudi's and
a half.</P>
<P>Nutmegs for fifty-&s;ix Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>Cinnamon comes at pre&s;ent from the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> The Tree
that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They
never take off but the fir&s;t and &s;econd, which is accounted the be&s;t. They
never meddle with the third, for &s;hould the Knife enter that, the Tree
would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they
learn from their youth. The Cinnamon Spice is much dearer to the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> then people think; for the King of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd
<PB N="63" REF="99">
King of <HI>Candy,</HI> from the name of his principal City, being a &s;worn
Enemy to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;ends his Forces with an intention to &s;urprize
them, when they gather their Cinnamon; &s;o that they are forc'd to
bring &s;even or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that
are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the
price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a
certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <HI>Portugals</HI>
were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of
the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all con&s;um'd. When it
was cold, the upper part became a Pa&s;te like white Wax; of which they
made Tapers to &s;et up in their Churches, for no &s;ooner were the Tapers
lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd. Formerly the <HI>Portugals</HI>
brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the <HI>Raja's</HI> about
<HI>Cochin.</HI> But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have de&s;troy'd all tho&s;e places, &s;o that the
Cinnamon is now in their hands. When the <HI>Portugals</HI> had that Coa&s;t,

<HI>Indians</HI> practi&s;e a more cunning way, which is to count the number of
threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the finene&s;s of

more narrow, or more cour&s;e. The difference is &s;ometimes &s;o difficult

threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great

<P>I Have told you, that when the Work-men have made up the Indigo-Pa&s;te
into lumps, with their fingers dipt in Oil, they lay them in
the Sun a drying. Now tho&s;e that have a de&s;ign to cheat the Merchants,
dry them in the &s;and, to the end that the &s;and &s;ticking to the Indigo,
&s;hould encrea&s;e the weight. Sometimes they lay up their Pa&s;te in moi&s;t
places, which makes it give, and con&s;equently renders it more heavy.
But if the Governour of the place di&s;covers the cheat, he makes them
&s;everely pay for it: and the be&s;t way of di&s;covery is to burn &s;ome pieces
of Indigo, for the &s;and will remain.</P>

<HEAD>Indian Broakers.</HEAD>
<P>THe Broakers are as it were the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indian</HI> Families; for
they have all Goods at their di&s;po&s;al. The Work-men choo&s;e the
mo&s;t aged and mo&s;t experienc'd, who are to endeavour equal advantages
for the whole Tribe they undertake for. Every evening that they return
from their bu&s;ine&s;s, and that; according to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
who make no Suppers, they have eaten &s;ome little piece of &s;weet-meat,
and drank a gla&s;s of water, the elde&s;t of the Tribe meet at the Broaker's
Hou&s;e, who gives them an account of what he has done that day, and
then they con&s;ult what he is to do next. Above all things, they caution
him to look to his hits, and to cheat, rather then be cheated.</P>
