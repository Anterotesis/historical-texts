<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HEre is great expectation every mo|ment of Newes from Admiral Tromp, and &s;o much the more, becau&s;e the Wind is We&s;terly, and an en|gagement very probable; it being Tromps Re&s;olution to fight, as he &s;ent word hither, and to the Hague, when he made &s;ail for the Coa&s;t of England. The Ea&s;tland Fleet of merchants, being near 500 in number, were &s;o frighted upon the Return of the Eng|li&s;h out of the North &s;ea, that they dur&s;t not &s;tir out of the Uly, but kept in, and perhaps they may not &s;tir out, til they hear what news from the men of war.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>There is now a very &s;trong Rumor of an Engagement at &s;ea; for divers who are newly arrived from Zealand &s;ay, they heard terrible &s;hooting in their pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>And news comes from Goree that &s;everal Ve&s;|&s;els who came in there, affirm, that they al&s;o heard the reports of innumerable &s;hot at &s;ea; and if an en|gagement be, great will be the con&s;equences, be|cau&s;e the All of this State lies at Stake. The people here are exceeding confident of Victory, and are up again with their old Rant; that nothing &s;hall &s;atisfie them but to be Ma&s;ters of the Seas, and Harbours of England, and to have a &s;urrender of &s;uch and &s;uch Towns for &s;ecurity, and to make amends for all their lo&s;&s;es. Some wi&s;er, as they think, then the re&s;t, are &s;o bold as to reckon up old &s;tories and ex|amples of &s;uch States as in times pa&s;t have been vi|ctorious at &s;ea, what conditions tho&s;e States have impo&s;ed upon them that they have &s;ubdued, not permitting them to put any men of war more out to &s;ea, but con&s;training them to &s;ail under the pro|tection of the Conquering party. And this they &s;ay was but Rea&s;on and Wi&s;dom to be imitated upon the like occa&s;ion: So that you &s;ee the&s;e Low Countries have high imaginations, and as highly
<PB N="5" REF="3">they may carry it, if they get the better. What then might England do, if it prove victorious, and im|prove its own right at &s;ea, &s;ince the&s;e who never had any right nor liberty, but by courte&s;ie or en|couragement, are &s;o violent in their premeditated Re&s;olves how to pro&s;ecute an U&s;urpation? If men dare to talk thus before the Victory, what wil they not do if they prove victorious? But per|haps England may remember, after all the &s;ore knocks for the recovery of her Soveraignty, there can be neither &s;afety, nor reputation to the I&s;land, unle&s;s (as of old) it remain ab&s;olute at &s;ea.</P>
<P>And &s;urely, this will be remembred now, and a requital returned for their mo&s;t horrid in&s;olencie, and unparallel'd ingratitude.</P>
<P>They are once more rai&s;ing all the &s;trength they can, and endeavour a conjunction with tho&s;e &s;hips at the Weilings; but there is little po&s;&s;ibili|ty, by rea&s;on that the Engli&s;h Fleet hath blocked up the Texel, and likewi&s;e lie with another Squa|dron before Goree-I&s;land and the Brill. As for the Relation of the landing of &s;ome Engli&s;h, the take|ing of &s;ome Forts, and the burning of &s;ome Dorps and Villages, we have it not confirm'd by any let|ters of credence; but the Report here carries a quite contrary Eccho.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>Now though the people, and tho&s;e out of doors do rant it thus high, yet tho&s;e within doors, the Councellors and Steers|men at the Hague, carry things more de|murely and clo&s;ely; who knowing they can retract when they plea&s;e, if they win the day, have therefore re&s;olved beforehand (for fear of the wor&s;t) that they will &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ie to the pre&s;ent power in Eng|land; and this re&s;olution is publi&s;hed every where, that the news of it may fly over &s;ea; and the Engli&s;h believe their intent was to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors, whether the &s;ucce&s;&s;e &s;hould prove good or bad at &s;ea; and for the more effectual per&s;wa&s;ion, it is given out, that nothing &s;hall alter this determi|nation of &s;ending The per&s;ons agreed on to be &s;ent are &s;aid to be four, viz. one out of Zealand, one out of Friezland, and the L. Newport and Beverning for Holland.</P>
<P>As concerning the Affaires of the&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="4">Provinces abroad, the &s;tate of them is very uncertain at pre&s;ent, mo&s;t Nations being at a &s;tand to &s;ee the event of this expected engagement: among others, the King of Denmark hangs off &s;til, being very anxious and &s;u&s;picious of the Swedi&s;h Queen, her fleet and forces being ready, and very &s;olli|citous about the &s;ucce&s;s of the Dutch a|gain&s;t the Engli&s;h, fearing if England pro|&s;per, the Flemmins may leave him in the lurch, as he hath done formerly.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;eeming O|vertures for peace, they go on vigorou&s;ly with their preparations for war, and &s;eve|ral Orders, Edicts, and Proclamations, has been printed and publi&s;hed, inciting all per|&s;ons in general, of what Nation &s;oever, to come in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, proffering dou|ble pay, that is, to every &s;ea-man 10 s. per week, and to every land-man 9 s. 4 d. per week. In pur&s;uance whereof, the Golden
<PB N="8" REF="5">Bank is broke open, as well in this City, as in o|ther places, and now the lofty Cedars, and others, begin to di&s;pute the lawfulne&s;s of the War, and the great Change and Revolutions that are like to occur thereupon.</P>
<P>And indeed great are the di&s;tractions of the poor people, in&s;omuch, that they have pre&s;ented &s;undry Petitions to the Councel at the Hague, for an ac|commodation with England, which have proved &s;o effectual, by working upon the pre&s;ent temper and &s;pirits of the States General, that they have agreed upon ten Propo&s;itions to be &s;ent to the pre&s;ent Power in England, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1 For the making up of the great breach be|tween the two Republicks.</P>
<P N="2">2 For the rendring due &s;atisfaction towards the va&s;t expence of men and money in this late unhap|py war.</P>
<P N="3">3 For entring into a League offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive.</P>
<P N="4">4 For the re&s;titution of all &s;hips taken.</P>
<P N="5">5 Concerning Caution and Security, &amp;c.</P>
