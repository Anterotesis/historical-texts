Grace, Peace, and Love in CHRIST JESUS,

<L>MY <HI>Sighs</HI> concern you all, throughout this <HI>Nati|on</HI></L>
<L>Who are this day, in true <HI>Humiliation</HI></L>
<L>To &s;eek the face of GOD; For, we make <HI>One</HI></L>
<L>Of tho&s;e <HI>two Pitchers</HI> whom I do bemone:</L>
<L>And, unto whom (then fearing much their breaking,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t I &s;aw <HI>War preparations</HI> making)</L>
<L>I &s;ent a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> both with an Intent</L>
<L>And hope, that which was feared, to prevent;</L>
<L>Which, failing my good purpo&s;e to produce,</L>
<L>I &s;end this now, to mediate a Truce;</L>
<L>For, who can tell, but that my words may have</L>
<L>Such <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ue now, as heretofore GOD gave</L>
<L>Unto a <HI>private-womans</HI> when &s;he &s;poke</L>
<L>For <HI>Abel,</HI> what effect in &s;ea&s;on took?</L>
<L>So may it pro&s;per as I am &s;incere</L>
<L>In that, Which I have <HI>Super&s;cribed</HI> here;</L>
<L>And, let my Foes on earth, be &s;till as many</L>
<L>As there are men, if I wi&s;h ill to any;</L>
<L>Or, am not plea&s;d that all &s;hould live and die</L>
<L>As happy, both in Life and Death as I</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="3">
I, ev'n for that cau&s;e, am in love, their debter;</L>
<L>For, him, who loves his Foes, GOD, loves the better:</L>
<L>Yea, having partly been, in my di&s;tre&s;s</L>
<L>Relievd by &s;ome few who, do naythele&s;s</L>
<L>Seem &s;till my Enemies; it, makes me more,</L>
<L>Love GOD, and all <HI>Mankinde,</HI> then heretofore.</L>
<L>A time is come, in which, it is our turn</L>
<L>Both <HI>altogether,</HI> and <HI>apart to mourn:</HI></L>
<L>Tho&s;e <HI>General Calamities</HI> befal</L>
<L>Which, for a <HI>general Repentance</HI> call,</L>
<L>And, for <HI>particular Humiliation,</HI></L>
<L>In order to a <HI>publick Reformation,</HI></L>
<L>From which, at pre&s;ent, are excepted none;</L>
<L>No, not the King, who &s;itteth on the Throne:</L>
<L>For, that which is in <HI>Cottages</HI> begun</L>
<L>Will &s;eize the <HI>Pallace,</HI> ere the <HI>Round</HI> is run,</L>
<L>If GOD in mercy, an&s;wer not our hope,</L>
<L>And, to our &s;ins and fears, vouch&s;afe a Stop.</L>
<L>To that end, though this be not what I would</L>
<L>Or, &s;hould contribute, it is what I could</L>
<L>And, may now, be as u&s;efully expre&s;t,</L>
<L>As what more artificially is dre&s;t:</L>

<L>Which I have o&s;t preferd without re&s;pect,</L>
<L>This, &s;eems a very &s;ea&s;onable time,</L>
<L>To greet you, with a <HI>Rea&s;onable Rime.</HI></L>
<L>Accept it therefore, and be not offended</L>
<L>With what is con&s;cientiou&s;ly intended.</L>
<L>GOD, who from us doth <HI>Trifles</HI> oft receive,</L>
<L>Requires of none, more then he hath to give;</L>
<L>And, if you &s;hall accept what's in my powr</L>
<L>He, will of that accept, which is in your;</L>

<L>I offer not, now <HI>Cures</HI> are to be done,</L>

<L>For, there's a <HI>Portion</HI> due from him that's poor,</L>
<L>Though from the Rich, there is expected more.</L>
<L>2. I had &s;ome education in the, <HI>Schools,</HI></L>
<L>But my be&s;t <HI>Teachings,</HI> came another way,</L>
<L>And, neither to the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t,</HI> or <HI>meer Fools,</HI></L>

<L>Who, (not much under or much over witted)</L>
<L>More in the <HI>Matter,</HI> then the <HI>Words</HI> delight.</L>
<L>By that means, when with <HI>Trifles</HI> I begin,</L>
<L>Things u&s;eful, are oft, thereby Skrewed in,</L>
<L>Which peradventure, had not el&s;e been &s;ought,</L>
<L>Where, they appeard more likely to be taught:</L>
<L>What I but to one end, at fir&s;t intended,</L>
<L>Occa&s;ions many <HI>Cautions,</HI> ere 'tis ended.</L>
<L>So, &s;ometimes, twenty bu&s;ine&s;&s;es are done,</L>
<L>By him, who went from home, to do but one.</L>
<L>3. Sometimes too, by what in this mode is hinted,</L>
<L>(On &s;leight occa&s;ions in a Vulgar Strain)</L>
<L>Such Notions have been in the heart imprinted</L>
<L>As were more plau&s;ibly expre&s;t in vain:</L>
<L>Yea, otherwhile, a few <HI>plain words,</HI> in &s;ea&s;on,</L>

<L>Then is (although more gloriou&s;ly arayd)</L>

<L>Now therefore, I contribue thus, alone,</L>
<L>To what was this day, publickly begun.</L>
<L>But, &s;tay! what Pannick fear hath &s;eizd this <HI>Nation</HI></L>

<L>God make th' effect, as real as the cau&s;e,</L>
<L>That, him with formal &s;howes we do not mock,</L>

<L>Again&s;t our <HI>Nation,</HI> &s;ince this Month begun,</L>
