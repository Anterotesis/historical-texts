<P>ACcidentally meeting with a certain Pamphlet concerning Courage, which was de&s;ign'd (no doubt) to weaken the Hands of Gods People, or di&s;may their Maje&s;ties Forces in this holy War by Sea and Land; I conceived it would not be in vain for me to publi&s;h &s;omething which might tend to their Maje&s;ties Welfare, and the Encourage|ment of the Fleet and Army in this depraved Age, wherein Fidelity is abandon'd by many as Anti|chri&s;tian. My Lords, the&s;e naked Truths in the&s;e Jejune Papers, are for the mo&s;t part &s;uch as were &s;ounded in the Ears of the Army: And therefore I have rea&s;on to hope they may be em|brac'd by them now with the &s;ame Candidne&s;s and Singlene&s;s of Heart as they were deliver'd, in or|der to the Advancement of Gods Glory, the good
<PB REF="3"> of the Church Militant, again&s;t the common Ene|my and Oppre&s;&s;or, and the Welfare, Peace and Hap|pine&s;s of their Maje&s;ties and their Kingdoms. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my Lords, there is in them no Po|litene&s;s of Style, Floridne&s;s of Phra&s;e, or Sweetne&s;s of Rhetorick, which may make them e&s;teem'd by the Learned: Yet I hope a familiar Scripture-dre&s;s may not be di&s;e&s;teem'd by the Vulgar and more &V;nlearn'd, for whom alone they are &s;ent abroad in this nice Age. And &s;ince nothing is &s;poken here but what hath been &s;poken before our Days, and Treati&s;es or Sermons are generally entertain'd ac|cording to the Proverb, <HI>Quot Homines tot Sen|tentiae.</HI> I mu&s;t crave the Honour of your Lord|&s;hips as to &s;helter the&s;e hone&s;t, tho' unpoli&s;h'd Pa|pers, under your Lord&s;hips Patronage, praying you to accept them, as a &s;incere Acknowledgment of that indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty which is owing unto your Lord&s;hips,</P>

<Q>Rebel not ye again&s;t the Lord, neither fear ye the People of the Land; for they are Bread for us: Their Defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: Fear them not.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEFORE we come to handle the&s;e Words in particular, it cannot be improper for to &s;hew you the occa&s;ion of them; together with the People unto whom they are &s;poken; and the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons that &s;pake 'em. We read in the Holy Bible, how God Almighty (of his free Grace and Goodne&s;s) cho&s;e the Seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> (which was afterwards call'd <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> becau&s;e as a Prince he had Power with God) unto him&s;elf, for to be a peculiar People unto him, above all other Nations: And therefore, he promi&s;ed for to multiply them as the Stars of Heaven for number, and to give unto them the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> for an Heritage. And in order to the fulfilling of his gracious Covenant, the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> brought his own People out from the mid&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by Temptations, by Signs and by Wonders, and by War, and by a mighty Hand, and by a &s;tretched Arm, and by great Terrors which he brought upon <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his whole Ho&s;t; and at length overturning them in the mid&s;t of the red Sea, as they were pur&s;uing the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Deut. 4. 34. More|over, the eternal God led his own People forty Years long in the Wilderne&s;s, going before them, by Day in a Pillar of a Cloud, for to &s;hew them by what way they &s;hould go, and by Night in a Pillar of Fire, to give Light unto 'em, and be a Wall or Defence between the Camp of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and the Camp of the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> So that the one came not near the other all Night. When they were come unto the Con|fines of the Land of Promi&s;e, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (by the Commandment of God and Entreaty of the People) &s;ent forth a Man out of every Tribe for to go before them and &s;earch the Land, and bring 'em Word back what it was, whether good or bad, and what People they were which dwelt therein; whether &s;trong or weak, few or many; and whether they dwelt in Cities, Tents or &s;trong Holds. After forty Days the&s;e Spys return'd from &s;earching the Land, and brought with them from
<PB N="2" REF="4"> thence &s;ome Grapes, Pomegranates and Figs, and came and told their Brethren, That it was a Land which flowed with Milk and Hony; but the People thereof were Strong and of a great Stature, and their Cities were wall'd and very great. Yea they &s;aid, That they &s;aw there Giants, the Sons of <HI>Anak,</HI> and they were in their own Sight, but as Gra&s;hoppers unto them; and therefore there was no going up again&s;t them, they were &s;o &s;trong. Thus the&s;e Spys which were &s;ent, brought up an evil Report upon the Land, in&s;omuch that all the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> lifted up their Voice and cryed; and the People wept all Night, and murmured again&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and again&s;t <HI>Aaron,</HI> &s;aying, Would God that we had died in the Land of <HI>Egypt:</HI> Or would God that we had died in this Wilderne&s;s. Wherefore hath the Lord brought us up to fall by the Sword, and our Wives and our little ones to become a Prey? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were it not better for us to return into <HI>Egypt?</HI> And they &s;aid one to another, Let us make us a Captain, and let us return thither. Upon this <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> fell on their Faces before all <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> And tho&s;e two mighty Men of Valour, which were of them that had &s;earch'd the Land, and had another Spirit in them, following God fully; Namely, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> the Son of <HI>Nun,</HI> and <HI>Ca|leb</HI> the Son of <HI>Jephunneth,</HI> u&s;ed their be&s;t endeavours for to &s;till and &s;a|tisfie the People, and to cau&s;e them to be better opinionated towards the Country; and to remember how the mo&s;t high God was their De|fence, and had fought their Battels for them, again&s;t their Enemies; and how he had led them &s;afely thither, &s;aying, The Land which we pa&s;&s;ed through for to &s;earch it, is an exceeding good Land: If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this good Land, and give it to us. <HI>Only rebel not ye again&s;t the Lord, neither fear ye the People of,</HI> &amp;c. As if they had &s;aid, You who&s;e Eyes have &s;een, what great things the Lord your God did for you, ever &s;ince he brought you out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or out of the Furnace, by the Hands of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron:</HI> You who are his own peculiar People, for you now to fear, when ye are at the very Borders of the Land, is very evil. There|fore do not rebel again&s;t the Lord, in murmuring again&s;t his Mini&s;ters, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> whom he hath &s;et over you: But remember the mighty Hand of God, which bare you in all this Wilderne&s;s, as a Man doth his Son; and be not di&s;couraged at the Strength of the Peo|ple, the number of their Cities, and the height of their Walls, for the Lord your God which goeth before you, he it is that fighteth for you, <HI>Rebel not ye again&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Words do naturally teach us the&s;e three Le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="4">1. That when once the Lord is departed from a Nation or People, Fleet or Army, it cannot pro&s;per or &s;tand. <HI>Their Defence is departed from them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That God only is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Defence of his Church, a|gain&s;t her Adver&s;aries. <HI>And the Lord is with us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That to fear the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and not the Arm of Fle&s;h, or to be very Couragious in Fighting God's Battel, is a Duty required of all his People (but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which are called thereunto by lawful Authority) and a principal means for to keep the Lord with or among &s;uch a People or Army. For, &s;ays the Text, <HI>Fear them not.</HI> Of the&s;e in their order, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t, which openeth and no Man &s;huts, and &s;huts and no Man open|eth; who can &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of the Mo&s;t-high, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, and who&s;e Grace is &s;ufficient to ena|ble the weake&s;t In&s;trument.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That when once the Lord is departed from a Nation or Peo|ple, Fleet or Army, it cannot pro&s;per or &s;tand. The truth of this I &s;hall endeavour (God willing) to make out, two manner of ways, 1. From the Nature of God. And 2. From the Te&s;timony of his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From the Nature of God, who is the Fountain and Original from whence &s;prings all our Happine&s;s and Comfort; and from whom alone every good Gift and every perfect Gift comes: As Health, Strength, Grace, Meekne&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Faith, Pro&s;perity and Plenty. It is he that gives us &s;uch fruitful Sea&s;ons, and fills our Hearts with Joy and Gladne&s;s: It is the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> alone that giveth Salvation unto Kings, and delivers his Servants from the hurtful Sword: It is that Almighty and Eternal E&s;&s;ence (who is the great and glorious Creator of all things, and Judg of all Men, and Searcher of all Hearts, and Rewarder of &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him) who pre&s;erves, main|tains and upholds, all other Beings what&s;oever, both in Heaven above, in the Earth beneath, and in the Water under the Earth, by his mo&s;t infinite and unlimited Power and Omnipotency. And therefore he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy; he hath the &s;ame So|veraignity and Power of us, and over all Kingdoms and Nations, as the Potter hath over the Clay, of the &s;ame Lump to make one Ve&s;&s;el unto Honour, and another unto Di&s;honour. He removes and &s;ets up Kings, and di&s;po&s;es of Kingdoms, and changes Times and Sea&s;ons according to his Plea&s;ure: For the Earth is the Lords, and the fulne&s;s thereof, the World and they that dwell therein: So that he can do
<PB N="4" REF="5"> what&s;oever he will with the World. He hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, &s;o that 'tis ea&s;ily &s;unk, being a bad Foundation; and e&s;ta|bli&s;hes it upon the Flouds, and that's as dangerous a Situation, ac|cording to human Sen&s;e and external Appearance. But yet by the in|finite Power of that Almighty God, who laid the corner Stone of the World, and hath &s;et due Bounds, Bars and Doors, unto the proud &s;welling Sea [who&s;e Waves roar and to&s;s them&s;elves, yet can they not prevail, but da&s;h them&s;elves into pieces] it is that this mighty Ma&s;s is &s;upported. It is he alone that makes the Earth bring forth, that our Garners may be full, affording all manner of Store, and our Sheep may bring forth thou&s;ands, and our Oxen &s;trong to labour, and gives us all things liberally and upbraids not. Oh there's nothing can pro&s;per without his Ble&s;&s;ing, who is the Foundation of all Ble&s;&s;ings, neither can any thing be done without his Providence over us, his Spi|rit to guide us, and Grace and Strength to enable us; who mea&s;ureth the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and meeteth out Heaven with a Span, and comprehendeth the Du&s;t of the Earth in a Mea&s;ure, and weighs the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 40. 12. Therefore if this mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and omnipotent God once but gather unto him&s;elf his Holy Spirit, his Breath, Protection and Pre&s;ervati|on, from a Nation; If he once depart from a Fleet or Army, then that Nation, Fleet or Army, which is without God, with or among them, cannot but &s;ink and peri&s;h; becau&s;e the very Elements in their kind, will then Fight again&s;t them, as the Stars in their Cour&s;es fought again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era.</HI> When the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> is departed from a People, then its Courage and Strength, its Rock of Salvation and Defence, its Refuge, Sanctuary and Fountain of Ble&s;&s;ing, its Giver of Grace and Safety, yea, its only Friend and Giver of Victory in Battel, is gone away; and there can be no pro&s;pect to &s;uch a People, but Ruin and De&s;truction. This we find in the Ca&s;e of all the Kings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> tho' they were mighty and had va&s;t Armies: Yet notwith&s;tanding when they once perceived, that the great God, the &s;upream Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth was departed from them, and with the <HI>I&s;rael|ites,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them wonderfully in all their Undertakings, and in drying up the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> for them, to enter the Land of <HI>Ca|naan:</HI> Then pre&s;ently all their Hearts melted within them for Fear, and there was no more Spirit in them, becau&s;e of the Children of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> Jo&s;h. 5. 1. And therefore our Church prays, Wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our Ho&s;ts? Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of Man without thee: Through God our Forces, both by
<PB N="5" REF="5"> Sea and Land, &s;hall do valiantly, and 'tis he alone that &s;hall tread down our Enemies. 'Tis &s;aid of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> that after his Head was &s;haven, he became weak and like another Man; and he &s;aid, I will go out as at other times before, and &s;hake my &s;elf. (Ob&s;erve) For he wi&s;t not that the Lord his Strength was departed from him, <HI>Judg.</HI> 16. 20. In like manner the Adver&s;aries of God, and his true reform'd Church, may (yea and do) take Coun&s;el together, again&s;t our Sovereign Lord and Lady King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> as they have done at other times again&s;t Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (of ble&s;&s;ed Memory) but it &s;hall come to nought, and their Strength, like <HI>Samp&s;ons,</HI> &s;hall deceive 'em; be|cau&s;e the Lord is departed from them. The common Enemy of Truth and Oppre&s;&s;or of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace in <HI>Europe,</HI> may vaunt him&s;elf as at other times, and &s;ay, Is not this great <HI>Babylon,</HI> that I have built? Have not I overthrown Towns, and laid wa&s;te fenced Cities? Have not I expell'd from my Kingdom all tho&s;e that would not obey me rather than God? By the might of my Power, and for the Honour of my Maje&s;ty, becau&s;e I mu&s;t and will be obey'd; el&s;e I will &s;et my Blood-thir&s;ty Dragoons upon them. But he con&s;iders not that the Lord is departed from him, and that his va&s;t Army &s;hall be &s;mitten with Terror. Look well then, O thou Enemy of Truth and Peace, upon the Hand-writing on the Wall; for it may well make thy Countenance change, and thy Thoughts to trouble thee; and the Joynts of thy Loyns to be loo&s;ed, and thy Knees to &s;mite one again&s;t another; to con&s;ider, How many thou&s;ands of Souls are now crying under the Altar again&s;t thee, &s;aying, How long, O Lord, Holy and True, do&s;t thou not judg and avenge our Blood on that cruel Tyrant that dwells on the Earth, who hath &s;pilt it like Water on every &s;ide! Oh will it not once be! <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 10.</P>
<P>Secondly, from the Te&s;timony of his Holy Spirit, which declares plainly, That in vain is Salvation hoped for, from the Multitude of Men or Ships, from the Hills, or from the Mountains, or from any human Force or Power; for truly in the Lord our God is the Sal|vation of his People: And &s;ays the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> The Lord is my Light and my Salvation, whom then &s;hall I fear? The Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom &s;hall I be affraid? When the Wicked, even my Foes came upon me, to eat up my Fle&s;h, they &s;tumbled and fell, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 26. 1, 2. &amp;c. Now to &s;hew this great Truth, That when once the Lord is departed from any Nation or People, Fleet or Army, it cannot pro&s;per or &s;tand; We may take notice of God's own Peo|ple them&s;elves, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who when they tempted and
<PB N="6" REF="6"> provoked the mo&s;t-high God to Anger, and &s;o cau&s;ed him to depart from them, and for&s;ake his Dwelling&punc; place; how un&s;ucce&s;sful they were then in all their Wars, being commonly di&s;comfited of their Enemies. As by <HI>Chu&s;han-ri&s;hathaim</HI> King of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> whom they &s;erved eight Years: And by <HI>Eglon</HI> King of <HI>Moab,</HI> whom they were &s;ubject to eighteen Years; and the cau&s;e you read was by rea&s;on the Lord was departed from them, <HI>Judg.</HI> 3. 8, 12. Moreover we find &s;uch another Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Amalek,</HI> as long as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (that familiar Friend of God) held up his Hand, and thereby cau&s;ed the Lord to be with his People; Then they prevailed over their Enemies. But as &s;oon as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Hands were let down, and the Lord was de|parted from the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> then <HI>Amalek</HI> prevailed over them. Oh where the infinite Maje&s;ty of the living and true God is pre&s;ent; there it cannot go any otherwi&s;e but well, whether it be Fleet or Ar|my, for every thing that's done there &s;hall pro&s;per: But where the mo&s;t-high is not pre&s;ent, or among them; there be &s;ure it cannot be well or pro&s;per, be their Power outwardly never &s;o great, and their Forces never &s;o &s;trong. An Example of this we may &s;ee in <HI>Zerah</HI> the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> who came again&s;t <HI>A&s;a</HI> with the greate&s;t Army that ever we read of in &s;acred or prophane Hi&s;tory: Even an Ho&s;t of a thou&s;and thou&s;and, and three hundred Chariots. And <HI>A&s;a</HI> cryed unto the Lord his God, and &s;aid, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many or with them that have no Power: Help us, O Lord our God, for we re&s;t on thee, and in thy Name we go again&s;t this Multitude: O Lord thou art our God, let not Man prevail again&s;t thee. So the Lord &s;mote the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> before <HI>A&s;a,</HI> and before <HI>Judas,</HI> and the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> fled, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 14. 11, 12. Alas! It is not a va&s;t and well di&s;ciplin'd Army (altho' God knows mo&s;t Men now have an Eye to that chiefly) nor the Strength of Ships, nor the Skill of Seamen, nor the Courage and Conduct of Officers, no nor yet the greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s of Artillery that gains the Victory; but its the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf that fights the Battel, and gives the Victory to whom he will (altho' it cannot be denied but that all the&s;e fore-mentioned Things are ab&s;olutely needful, and as the &s;econdary Cau&s;es of Victory.) <HI>David</HI> tells <HI>Goliath</HI> thus, &s;aying, Thou come&s;t to me depending altogether on thy own Strength, and well furni&s;h'd and prepared for Battel, as with a Sword, with a Spear, and with a Shield: But now I come to thee otherwi&s;e, not &s;o much confiding in my own Strength, as on Gods: And indeed I am &s;ure my Strength will not fail me, and therefore I will &s;mite thee, and give thy Carca&s;s unto the Fowls of the Air; That
<PB N="7" REF="6"> all the World may &s;ee and know, that thou, O Lord, who&s;e Name is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> art the &s;tronge&s;t and highe&s;t over all the Earth. And where God taketh the part, and is pre&s;ent among an Army, then there all the Enchantments, Plots, diabolical Arts or Con&s;piracies, are altogether invalid and ineffectual. And he, who is the Eye of his own People, will &s;oon di&s;cover them, and bring the Plotters to &s;hame and confu&s;ion; as <HI>Balak</HI> told <HI>Balaam</HI> concerning <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;aying, Surely there is no En|chantment again&s;t <HI>Jacob,</HI> neither is there any Divination again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> for the Lord his God is with him: And it &s;hall be &s;aid, in the Lord's due time of our Fleet and Army, What hath God wrought! Oh what a Victory was this! When the &s;trong holds are &s;urpriz'd, and the mighty Mens Hearts in <HI>Moab</HI> (who have magnified them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord and his Truth, and have wor&s;hip'd other Gods, Wood and Stone) &s;hall tremble, and be as the Heart of a Woman in Pangs. Be &s;till then, ye Adver&s;aries of God and Traytors to the be&s;t of Princes, &s;peak no more &s;o proudly again&s;t the Heritage of the Almighty: For know you a&s;&s;uredly that God, even our own God, will find an occa|&s;ion to bring down the Arrogancy of the Proud, and will lay low the Haughtine&s;s of the Terrible. So much then for Confirmation of our fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on. Let us in the next place, &s;incerely endeavour to improve this to our &s;elves, that &s;o the Lord our God may be glorified, in our Body and Spirits which are his; that we being deliver'd out of the Hands of her Enemies, may &s;erve him without fear.</P>
<P>Here is then, fir&s;t, an Inference of no &s;mall Comfort, unto the Church of God militant here on Earth, in this crooked and perver&s;e Generation; wherein all manner of Vice and Wickedne&s;s abounds daily, and Piety and Righteou&s;ne&s;s are &s;uch Strangers. To con&s;ider, That altho' War be ri&s;en again&s;t the People of God, yet, he is in the mid&s;t of his Church, to defend and keep her, that &s;he &s;hall not be mo|ved by all the Storms of Trouble and fierce Darts of the Devil; which are bent wholly again&s;t her: Nor by all the Plots and Con&s;piracies of the Children of Darkne&s;s; becau&s;e the eternal God will keep her &s;afe from the Snare of the Fowler, and Malice of evil Spirits. Oh what a Comfort is this unto every true Believer and Child of the mo&s;t-high, to ponder with it &s;elf! That tho' the Adver&s;aries of the Lord and his Church may be far more in number, and much &s;tronger in outward appearance; yet when the Captain of the Ho&s;t of the Lord, &s;tands ready with his Sword drawn in his Hand, to fight for his People, then they &s;ignifie nothing at all, and he can &s;mite 'em down, even at one Blow, as he did unto the great and mighty Armies of the King of <HI>Ca|naan.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"> And the People of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Jehovah</HI> have with them al|ways whole Ho&s;ts of glorious Angels and invi&s;ible Spirits, for to take their part again&s;t the Enemy of God and his Truth. But which is yet a farther Addition to the Churches comfort, That if her Enemies be better provided for War, and prepar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d for Battel &s;eemingly and externally, yet neverthele&s;s the mo&s;t holy and terrible Maje&s;ty of Hea|ven and Earth, who is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>all in all,</HI> and without whom all other helps and means are invalid and in&s;ignificant, is of (a cer|tain) departed and gone from them, and their Idolatrous and Super|&s;titious Camp. As we may collect, from the Record of the Spirit of Truth, which &s;ays, What Concord hath Chri&s;t with <HI>Belial?</HI> And what Agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? Oh! can we ima|gine, that the mo&s;t holy One (who charges the Angels with Folly, and is of purer Eyes, than to behold evil) will abide or continue there, and among &s;uch a People where the Glory which is due unto none but him alone, is day by day given another, and his Prai&s;e to graven Images? See <HI>I&s;a</HI> 42. 8. It cannot be thought ju&s;tly of him, for he is a jealous God, and when he doth vi&s;it, he will do it to the purpo&s;e. But on the other hand it cannot be denied, but that the omnipotent <HI>Jehovah</HI> may &s;eemingly withdraw his Pre&s;ence, and hide his ble&s;&s;ed Face for a &s;mall Moment, from his Church, which is the only Excellency wherein he delights, and as dear to him as the very Apple of his own Eye: Yet, be it known, that he will never fail nor for&s;ake her, but rejoyce over her as a Bridegroom doth over his Bride; and will give her his holy Spirit to comfort her, and guide her into all Truth: Nay he will be with her always even unto the end of the World. And this leaving of his Church for a while, is for her everla&s;ting good, for the Tryal of her Faith, Patience and Con&s;tancy, which is more precious than of Gold that peri&s;hes, tho' it be tryed by Fire. That &s;he may be found a holy and reform'd Church without Spot, and Blamele&s;s, unto Prai&s;e, and Honour and Glory, at the appearing of her dear Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 7.

For there's no doubt of it, but he &s;uffers him to fulfil the number of his Sins, and fill up the mea&s;ure of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which are not (perhaps) full ripe for Judgment. And then he will cau&s;e his own Terriblene&s;s inevitably to deceive him, and the Pride of his own evil Heart to lay him low, in an Hour that he is not aware of; as his did (&s;ometimes) to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon;</HI> while the very Word was in his Mouth: And who can tell but that his Day is come, and that happy time is at hand, wherein the mo&s;t terrible Maje&s;ty of the eternal King, the mighty Lord, will call him to an ac|count for all his Wickedne&s;s, and the Blood of his Saints and dear Children, which he &s;pilt like Water, and will &s;hew his Power on him, by making him to know and feel, That the Mo&s;t-high ruleth in the King|dom of Men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will; And none can &s;tay his Hand, or &s;ay unto him, What do&s;t thou?

And does not the Apo&s;tle tell thee, That the Husbandman waits with long Patience for the precious Fruits of the Earth? And mu&s;t you be impatient and limit God in his own Work? It is a grief to think on it, that there are a &s;ort of People among us, which are not unlike to tho&s;e Spies; apt to bring an evil Report upon their Ma|je&s;ties Forces by Sea and Land, and extolling the <HI>French</HI> in all Com|pany always where&s;oever they go: Sure &s;uch are evil-minded and un|believing Hearts. The Spies &s;aid, The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a Land which did eat up its Inhabitants, and all the People thereof were Gi|ants, or Men of a great Stature: And &s;o per&s;uaded the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they were not able to go up again&s;t them, they were &s;o &s;trong.

Depart then from among God's People, ye evil and unbelieving Hearts; for you weaken the Hands of the Almighty, and di&s;courage his People as much as you can. But let me tell you to your Faces, That the mighty God hath deliver'd our Nation &s;undry times out of far greater Dangers, than (I hope) we are now in: And &s;ure I am that the Lord's Hand is not &s;hortned, that he cannot &s;ave us now, as well as he hath done in our Fathers and Fore-fathers days: Yea, not long &s;ince, in our own Remembrance; if our crying Nati|onal Sins, our Murmurings, Complainings without cau&s;e, and our wicked and unbelieving Hearts, do not hinder him. Be warn'd then by the Example of the Spies, ye fal&s;e Reporters, and ye Murmurers and Complainers, by the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> le&s;t you provoke the mo&s;t-high God to Anger, and make him &s;wear in his Wrath, That none of you all, which have either &s;een with your Eyes, or heard with your Ears, the many great Deliverances which the Lord of Ho&s;ts hath wrought for this Kingdom, before our time, but more e&s;pecially not many years &s;ince, by the Hands of our mo&s;t gracious K. <HI>William,</HI> that mighty Prince of Valour, whom the Lord hath rai&s;ed up for to be a Deliverer of his reform'd Church, &s;hall ever be &s;o happy, as to live to &s;ee or hear of Mercy and Truth met together, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace to em|brace each other, in all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Oh be a&s;ham'd and blu&s;h, ye fal&s;e Reporters, and cau&s;le&s;s and unju&s;t Murmurers and Complainers, and give the Lord the Prai&s;es due unto his mo&s;t holy Name; and ren|der unto the King the Honour and Obedience which is due unto his Maje&s;ty, who hath graciou&s;ly given you your Lives for a Prey, when as ye were appointed as Sheep to the Slaughter!

<PB N="11" REF="8"> Safety. And do ye now grudg to pay a little Mony towards the War? Is it po&s;&s;ible that Chri&s;tians &s;hould be thus ungrateful and for|get their Danger &s;o &s;oon, and be willing to return again into <HI>Egypt?</HI> (I mean) Are you willing to be reduc'd to Popery, Slavery and Ar|bitrary Power again? Or rather, to be in &s;ubjection to <HI>French</HI> Dra|goons? God forbid: Search then and try your ways, and meddle no more with our ble&s;&s;ed Governors and Government, which does not concern you: But bu&s;ie your Heads about your own Occa&s;ions, and turn thus again unto the Lord: And then we have no cau&s;e to fear, but that God, even our own God, &s;hall give this Kingdom his Ble&s;&s;ing: God &s;hall ble&s;s their Maje&s;ties and their Forces, and pro&s;per their Arms both by Sea and Land, and all the ends of the World &s;hall fear him; becau&s;e they &s;hall &s;ee or hear of the mighty Salvation, which he hath wrought for his Church and People.</P>
<P>Secondly, This may caution and admoni&s;h the whole Nation in ge|neral (but in a more e&s;pecial manner you that belong to the Fleet or Army) in this mo&s;t deceitful Age of ours, for to take heed and be|ware of all di&s;affected and treacherous Per&s;ons, which have no fear of God before their Eyes; and therefore will make it no &s;cruple of Con&s;cience to &s;tart a&s;ide from their Duty and Allegiance, unto their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties, like a deceitful Bow, upon the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. And let me declare my Mind freely, and tell you, That I am per&s;uaded there are not a few, who have li&s;ted them&s;elves in this pre&s;ent Ser|vice, both by Sea and Land, on meer purpo&s;e (as <HI>Joab</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>Ab|ner</HI> to King <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 3. 25.) to deceive their Maje&s;ties, and to know their going out and their coming in, and to know all that they do; and what Forces they have by Sea and Land in a readine&s;s; and then to inform the Enemy therewith the fir&s;t opportunity. And therefore I may boldly &s;ay, you that are gone forth to War, cannot be too circum&s;pect and diligent, in &s;earching the Minds and Hearts of all tho&s;e employed in the Service. And to further you herein, we be&s;eech the great Searcher of all Hearts and Tryer of the Reins, for to di&s;cover all evil and di&s;affected Per&s;ons and private Traytors daily, both by Sea and Land; that &s;o they may be put to Shame and Confu&s;ion. And we will heartily pray, That the everla&s;ting Arms may be underneath their Maje&s;ties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> that they may be compa&s;s'd about with the Favour and Protection of the Almighty, and pro&s;per in all their ways: But let all their Enemies, O our God, fall down and flee before them and their Arms! <HI>Amen.</HI> What can Rebels expect at the Hands of the Immortal King, which
<PB N="12" REF="9"> is immutable and mo&s;t faithful? But that he &s;hould command &s;uch unfaithful Per&s;ons to be bound Hand and Foot, and ca&s;t among their Fellows, the Apo&s;tate Angels, there to be kept in everla&s;ting Chains, under Darkne&s;s, and to dwell with devouring Fire and everla&s;ting Burnings. For the terrible and mo&s;t holy God declares to us, That he equally abhors both the Blood thir&s;ty and deceitful treacherous Man: And wi&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, That who&s;o&punc;provoketh the King to Wrath, and is deceitful to him, Sins again&s;t his own Soul, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20. 2. He means thus, That the Soul of a Traytor &s;hall &s;uffer in the World to come, altho' his Body may e&s;cape it here on Earth. For be it known unto all Men, That a King that rules in the fear of the Lord, and according to the Truth of his holy Word, can never be honour'd or obey'd enough by his Subjects; and ought to be priz'd as dear unto that Kingdom, as the Eye to the Body; and is as nece&s;&s;ary for its Pro&s;perity as the Sun is to the Firmament, which gives both Light and Life, and makes all the Earth become fruitful. That Coun&s;el of <HI>Ve|getius</HI> unto a Prince, is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; What you have to do, con|fer with many; what ye will do, with very few, or none but your own &s;elf: For there are no better Coun&s;els, than tho&s;e which the Enemy knoweth not, before they are put in Execution. But to &s;peak to you that are employ'd by their Maje&s;ties in this Holy War, Let me charge you, before God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Elect An|gels, for to hold fa&s;t your Loyalty, your Allegiance and Obedience unto our gracious King and Queen, without wavering: And make it one part of your bu&s;ine&s;s for to provoke one another daily thereunto, now in the&s;e evil Days (above all other times) and &s;o much the more as you &s;ee or hear of the hour of Battel approaching: Wherein I I que&s;tion not, but the &s;trong God, will manife&s;t his great Power and mighty Arm unto the World, and e&s;pecially again&s;t your Enemies, in your behalf, if you do but tru&s;t in him, and call upon him duly by Prayer.</P>
<P>But in the next place, as this ought to caution and admoni&s;h every one in the whole Nation, to beware of di&s;affected Per&s;ons and Tray|tors: So in a more peculiar manner to take good heed of provoking the mo&s;t-high God to Anger, again&s;t us or our Ho&s;ts, by our unre|pented of and unmortified Sins. We know that Righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|alteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People: And for it the Land it &s;elf mourns, and the Fleet and Army is in no &s;mall danger; becau&s;e the weight of our National Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, do out-weigh others (I am affraid) in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<P>Oh that all per&s;ons then from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t would but &s;eriou&s;ly turn to God, with Fa&s;ting, Weeping, and Mourning! Oh that the whole Nation, would but be of one Mind and Heart, upon our Solemn Fa&s;t Days; and wre&s;tle with God by Prayer, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did with the Angel, and not let him go, until he had ble&s;&s;ed us, and our Forces! I would to God, I could prevail with you all, for to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of the Murmuring, complaining, unbelieving <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> and &s;o to be warn'd and repent. For doth not the Apo&s;tle tell us, in mo&s;t plain Words; That the&s;e things happened unto the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> for Ex|amples, and are Written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come? (Mark) That we &s;hould not be Idolaters, as were &s;ome of them; That we &s;hould not commit Fornication, as did &s;ome of them, and fell in one Day three and twenty Thou&s;and: That we &s;hould not &s;wear, or take the Name of God in vain as did &s;ome of them, and were de&s;troyed of the de&s;troyer: That we &s;hould not have in us evil Hearts of unbelief and &s;o provoke the Maje&s;ty of Heaven, to refu&s;e to go forth with our Ho&s;ts, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 6. to 12. There are three Vices, or Sins, e&s;pecially above all others (noted by Hi&s;torians) which bring danger, and publick Puni&s;hment, and Calamity unto a Kingdom or People, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Ungodline&s;s, Inju&s;tice, and Luxurious|ne&s;s. Ungodline&s;s troubleth the Church, Inju&s;tice the vulgar People; and Luxuriou&s;ne&s;s private Families: And the hurt in &s;pecial, re|dounds to the whole Nation. Therefore, <HI>Salmoxes</HI> Coun&s;el is not ami&s;s, &s;aying, that the&s;e Things &s;hould by all means be avoided, by every one that fears God (namely) Sluggi&s;hne&s;s from the Body, Ig|norance from the Mind, Gluttony from the Belly, Sedition and Faction from the Church and Nation, Di&s;cord from the Family, Di&s;loyalty and Treachery from the Governours and Government, Intemperance from all things, and above all other, Sin and Iniquity from every true Chris|tian. Oh that the&s;e Rules were but generally followed, and practis'd throughout our whole Nation, that &s;o the everla&s;ting Father of Lights might pro&s;per us in our Labours and Arms.</P>
<P>But, let me addre&s;s my &s;elf in a more e&s;pecial manner, unto you who are gone forth to warr again&s;t the Enemy: You have heard here, how the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> provoked the infinite Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth to Wrath, by their evil Ways, and &s;inful Actions; and cau&s;ed the mo&s;t Great and Terrible God&punc; (who was their Helper and Defen|der) to depart from them, and leave them to the will of their Enemies, in&s;omuch that they were &s;mitten of them, &s;undrie times. Oh! that this may be a warning unto all, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t: And an effectual argument, to prevail with every one of you, both Officers
<PB N="14" REF="10"> and Souldiers, for to leave off your mo&s;t horrid Oaths, your prophane Speeches, your di&s;&s;olute Actions, your intemperate drinkings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to give your &s;elves wholly unto the contrary Virtues; As to the de|nying all Ungodline&s;s, and Worldly Lu&s;ts; And to live &s;oberly, Righ|teou&s;ly and Godly the remainder of your Days: And if you do thus, then you may ju&s;tly hope for the Ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty, upon your endeavours, and (upon good Ground) expect to pro&s;per in that employment whereunto ye are called. But, if you &s;till do wickedly; If you &s;till continue in Sin, and di&s;obey the Commandments of God, Can you rea&s;onably think that the Lord of Ho&s;ts, will abide with you; or take your part again&s;t the Enemy? Oh no, he is a mo&s;t ju&s;t, and Holy God, who will by no means clear the guilty: But will execute the fiercene&s;s of his Wrath again&s;t you, until he hath de&s;troyed you from off the Face of the Earth, and blotted out your Names from un|der Heaven. We have the Te&s;timony of the Holy Gho&s;t for this and many examples in the Sacred Scriptures: As the old World which was drown'd, <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> de&s;troyed with Fire and Brim&s;tone from Heaven; The <HI>Galileans,</HI> on whom the Tower of <HI>Siloam</HI> fell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then in Prophane Hi&s;tory, we Read that in the third Year, after that <HI>Pompey</HI> had won <HI>Jeru&s;alem (Valerius Gracchus,</HI> being Pre&s;ident of <HI>Judea</HI>) a certain Jew, came to the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> for to complain of the grievances, and inju&s;tice done in that Country, by their Ma|gi&s;trates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And among other expre&s;&s;ions, he &s;pake thus. O Learn|ed Fathers! O happy People! your Ble&s;&s;ed De&s;tinies that favour'd you, and our angry God, who hath for&s;aken us for our Sins, hath now made the famous Metropolitan City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> once the Commander of all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and Mother of the Jews, Subject and Servant unto <HI>Rome,</HI> and to you Romans. Great indeed was the Courage and Power of <HI>Pompey,</HI> and great was his Army that overcame us. But I will tell you, much greater was the Wrath and Fury of our God; And with|out compari&s;on, the Number of our Sins, for which we have de&s;erved to be utterly overthrown. It is worthy to be noted by you all, that what&s;oever People, or Nation, Fleet, or Army, doth pre&s;s the Lord down mo&s;t, with the Weight and Burden of Sin; That Nation, or People, &s;hall be &s;ure to feel mo&s;t of Gods heavy&punc; Hand upon it, <HI>Amos</HI> 2. 13. And thus the Ju&s;tice of the mo&s;t High will perform, for it is gone out of his Lips, and he cannot Rever&s;e it, That he will render unto a People according to its de&s;ervings. Therefore it high|ly concerns the whole Nation in general; and you (of the Fleet and Army) in particular, for to give Glory to the Lord our God, before
<PB N="15" REF="10"> he cau&s;e Darkne&s;s of Calamity or Captivity; and before our Feet Stum|ble upon the Dark Mountains; and while we look for Light: Le&s;t he turn it into the Shadow of Death, and make it gro&s;s Darkne&s;s, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 16. The Prophets meaning is thus, according to Bi&s;hop <HI>Tayler</HI> upon it. Repent of all your Wickedne&s;s, before the Almighty come to &s;earch and find us out, by his heavy Judgments; And that while we have time and opportunity afforded us: And this is the only means (through the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t) for to appea&s;e Divine Wrath, <HI>Revel.</HI> 16. 9. And they repented not to give Glory to God. Oh let us all then be per&s;waded to break off all our Sins, by Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for it may be a lengthening of our Happine&s;s, and an Infallible Means to cau&s;e the Lord to de&s;troy our Enemies. Rebel not ye again&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, that God only, is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t defence of his Church again&s;t her Adver&s;aries. And this Truth may appear (1) From the Attributes and Titles of God, in the Holy Scriptures, and (2) By the manifold deliverances of his Church and People in all Ages, of the World. Fir&s;t from the Attributes, and Titles of God; He is mo&s;t Holy, and therefore in the fir&s;t place, we may with great &s;afety tru&s;t in him, and rely on his Word and Promi&s;e, for help in time of trouble, and he will deliver us. For this is no mean Comfort unto his Church, that the Lord is Righteous in all his Ways, and Holy in all his Works: And therefore he will not for&s;ake a Holy Nation, nor a Re|penting Praying People. He never leaves off a Kingdom unto it &s;elf, until it fir&s;t leaveth him by unholyne&s;s and filthy conver&s;ation; and therefore (I Pray) let us all Wor&s;hip the Lord, with a Holy Wor|&s;hip. Secondly, he is mo&s;t Wi&s;e, and therefore no Policy or Sub|tilty of his Adver&s;aries can inveigle him: He &s;ees all their Snares, and Con&s;piracies, and all their &s;ecret Thoughts, and hath them in deri&s;ion: For he taketh the Wi&s;e in their own Craftine&s;s, and maketh Diviners mad.</P>
<P>Thirdly, he is mo&s;t able, and of greate&s;t Power and Might; and hence he encourages his Servant <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;aying, I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17 1. Then for his Ti|tles; He is called <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or rather <HI>Jehueh,</HI> which &s;ignifies his being is of him&s;elf, <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 42. 8. and he is called <HI>Elohim,</HI> which denotes the Glo|rious Trinity, <HI>Elohim, Bara;</HI> The Mighty God, or the three Per&s;ons in the Trinity, <HI>Ben, Rua, Ab,</HI> the Son, the Spirit, and the Father. He is called, <HI>El,</HI> which is as much, as &s;trong God, and &s;ignifies, That God is not only mo&s;t &s;trong, and Fortitude it &s;elf in his own E&s;&s;ence: But it is he alone that gives Strength and Power unto all his People; and
<PB N="16" REF="11"> hence t'was, that the Holy and Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us in his Agony on the Cro&s;s, Cried out, <HI>Eloi, Eloi,</HI> which in the Syrian Tongue &s;ignifies my &s;trong God, my &s;trong God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He is called in another place, <HI>Shaddai,</HI> which is Almighty; the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Tran&s;lates it by, <GAP DESC="foreign">, it is a derivative Word, and comes from <HI>Dai,</HI> &s;ufficiency, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>E&s;&s;entia qua &s;ibi &s;ui&s;que &s;ufficit;</HI> And of <HI>Shad,</HI> a Dug or Brea&s;t: To &s;ignifie, that God is all-&s;ufficient and able to &s;upply the wants and nece&s;&s;ities of his Children, what&s;oever they are, like the huge Ocean, which fills every Creek; which the Shallow narrow Rivulets of the Creatures large&s;t and be&s;t perfections cannot do.

To K. <HI>James</HI> I. and our Nation, when that horrid Powder Plot was di&s;cover'd, and laid open by the un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the Lord; that cruel Plot, I &s;ay, which was hatch'd in Hell, and carried on with the greate&s;t Secrets, by tho&s;e Engins of <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> and Soul-Deceivers and Murderers, the Je&s;uits and Prie&s;ts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faction, which &s;aid, God and Man had concur'd to puni&s;h the Iniquity of the Times. But to come to &s;ome Examples in our Days, which our Eyes have &s;een, and Ears heard. Oh was not the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> the be&s;t Defence of that mighty Prince of Valour (now our graci|ous K. <HI>William</HI>) and his whole Fleet, in the mid&s;t of very a terrible Storm, rai&s;ed, no doubt, by the Prince of the Power of the Air, on behalf of his Chil|dren

And after that we had offer'd to him there, the Sacrifice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, for &s;o merciful a Deliverance, and tarried there about 11 days, then did Almighty God &s;end us a fair Wind, which brought us all &s;afely into <HI>Torbay,</HI> where our mo&s;t renown'd and ble&s;|&s;ed Prince landed.

Oh there is no que&s;tion to be made, but that the eternal Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth &s;helter'd our gracious King under his mighty Wings, and encom|pa&s;s'd him about with his Favour and Protection; and we hope and pray that he will &s;till do &s;o unto him for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Here is then a very &s;harp Reproof unto all wicked and unbelieving Hearts, who are even di&s;tracted and at their Wits end, at the very noi&s;e of a giddy Multitude: As if the everliving and terrible Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, even the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Hand was &s;hortned: As if he was not as able to ble&s;s and pre&s;erve their mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ties, in the&s;e days, as he was in our Fore-fathers time. Or, as if he could not cover them and this Nation with the mighty Wings of his Providence, from all Perils and Dangers of the Enemy now, as he hath done all along. Oh take notice then, all ye faint-hearted, faithlels and unbelieving Souls, of tho&s;e words of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Chap. 32. 18, 19, 27. Behold I am the great, the mighty God, the Lord of Ho&s;ts is my Name. I am the God of all Fle&s;h, great in Coun&s;el and mighty in Work: Is there any thing too hard for me? Are you &s;o fooli&s;h and unwi&s;e as to think, that all the Plots, Con&s;piracies and Devices, which are again&s;t my faithful Servants (who fulfil my Will) &s;hall ever prevail? Do you imagine that I, who am the mo&s;t ju&s;t and righ|teous Governor of the World, do not regard tho&s;e my Deputies, which rule according to the Truth of my holy Word, and are a Terror to the Evil, and a Prai&s;e to them that do well?

Or what if they have a &s;econd <HI>Achitophel?</HI> But to go higher, What if they have a &s;econd <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> or a &s;econd <HI>Solomon?</HI> Yet &s;till &s;o long as we have the Almighty, mo&s;t ter|rible and all wi&s;e for our Defence, who is the Fountain of all Wi&s;dom and Knowledg, and the Giver of Courage and Strength, Deliverance and Sal|vation, we need not to care. Suppo&s;e we want &s;ome of the Beams, &s;o we have but the Sun it &s;elf: And what matter is it, if we want &s;ome of the Streams, when we have the pure Spring? Nay, corrupt Streams and mud|dy, and deceitful Branches are very unwhole&s;ome and infectious unto the Body Politick; and therefore if they are dryed up or wa&s;ted, we need not to care. But now for the Church of God to hold fa&s;t together, and to be <GAP DESC="foreign">, with one Heart in one place, is a very good and joyful thing, and no doubt exceeding acceptable in the &s;ight of God our heavenly Father.

For tho' it cannot be denied, but that the effectual fervent Prayer of one righteous Man, avails much; yet it mu&s;t be granted, that the joynt Prayers of a Congregation, or rather of the whole Church, prevail infinitely more. One Stick may make a Fire, but many Sticks put together will make a great and hot Fire: One String of an In&s;trument may make a &s;ound, but many Strings a melodious Har|mony. One &s;ingle Prayer in our Clo&s;ets may be a Sacrifice, but the Pray|ers of a whole Kingdom makes a Sacrifice to God, of a &s;weet &s;melling Sa|vour;

<P>But as this reproves all wicked and unbelieving Hearts, &s;o in the next place, it is no &s;mall Encouragement, unto all the Servants of the mo&s;t high God, for to fear him and &s;erve him in Truth, with a perfect Heart and willing Mind. For it is an undeniable A&s;&s;ertion, That &s;uch a Kingdom or People, cannot be moved or &s;haken by any terrible Bla&s;ts of the Devil or his In&s;truments, who hath the eternal Lord for its Strength and Defence. And I may truly &s;ay, that there are no times &s;o very Perillous, nor Days &s;o very Evil, but that they may be made ea&s;ie and happy unto every Child of God, and Believer in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I mean, the dangerou&s;ne&s;s and bad|ne&s;s of the&s;e times (which many groundle&s;ly and unju&s;tly complain of) may be reduced to an equality, with the Peace, Safety and Comfort of better times: Yea, may be made equal unto the be&s;t of Days, which this pre&s;ent World commonly affords unto the Church militant. As the &s;harp|ne&s;s of a very cold and pinching Sea&s;on, may (by a proportionable addi|tion of warm Cloathes, the u&s;e of good Fires, and the like) be made as little offen&s;ive to a Man's Con&s;titution, as a temperate Sea&s;on is: Or as a Man who is &s;hut up clo&s;e in a mo&s;t &s;trong or impregnable Ca&s;tle, and is there &s;ufficiently provided and &s;tored with all things nece&s;&s;ary; as Men, Arms, Mony, Powder, Ball, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is in as much or rather more &s;afety and freer from all danger (altho' he be encompa&s;&s;ed about and be&s;ieged by his inveterate and implacable Enemies at the &s;ame time) than another Man is, who hath no Enemies at all, &s;eemingly near him.

Whereas 'tis far otherwi&s;e with an ungodly wicked Man, who is like the troubled Sea, when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e Waters ca&s;t up Mire and Dirt. There is no Peace, &s;aith my God, to the Wicked.

Here is the place appointed for us to work in, while it is day; or rather the Lord's Vineyard. But in the Kingdom of Heaven are we to expect, and receive our Wages when our Work is done, or our Cour&s;e fini&s;hed: For there is the re&s;t which remains for the People of God.

<P>Thirdly and La&s;tly, That to fear the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and not the Arm of Fle&s;h, or to be very Couragious in fighting God's Battel, is a Duty required of all his People (but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which are called thereunto by Lawful Authority) and a principal means for to keep the Lord with or among &s;uch a People or Army. The truth of this Le&s;&s;on we may &s;ee confirm'd to us in the ca&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> here in this Chapter of our Text.

<P>We might bring in a multitude a Texts to the like purpo&s;e: But we &s;hall content our &s;elves with one or two more, out of the New Te&s;tament.

<P>What then mu&s;t we &s;ay unto very many in this Age, who are afraid at the very &s;haking of an A&s;pen-leaf, and hide them&s;elves at the beat of a Drum, or &s;ound of a Trumpet? Let me ask them, if they think &s;uch Pu&s;illanimity is decent, in any one who is called a Man, much more whether it be con&s;entaneous to one that nameth the Name of Chri&s;t, to fear and be di&s;mayed, where no fear is: And at the &s;ame Time to &s;tand in no awe of the mighty God and terrible, the &s;upreme Governour of Heaven and Earth, who is glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders? Alas, Alas! this cowardi&s;e or timidity of Spirit is a grand Shame for any Soldier of Chri&s;t, the Captain of our Salvation, to be guilty of; and it commonly hinders tho&s;e from the punctual Performance of their Duty, who are &s;uch fearful Hearts, as we may &s;ee in <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a Ruler of the Jews, who (for fear) dur&s;t not openly confe&s;s Chri&s;t, or come by Day (le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;een of the Jews) to be taught in that heavenly Do|ctrin of Regeneration, or the new Birth, by him who had the Words of Eternal Life, and &s;pake as never Man &s;peaketh. But on the other Hand, the true fear of God and Chri&s;tian Courage in the Heart of a Believer, maketh him (in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Phra&s;e) to be as bold as a Lion, and puts him upon any thing, even the mo&s;t perillous Attempts, in Obedience to Gods Holy Will and Commandments, and in Duty and Allegiance to his Prince: This was it which moved little <HI>David</HI> to encounter with the Giant <HI>Goliath,</HI> the Champion of the <HI>Philistines;</HI> he heard his words, how he defied <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;aw they were all afraid and di&s;mayed, and therefore he re&s;olves with him&s;elf to go and Fight him, and he came to King <HI>Saul,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>Let no Mans Heart fail, becau&s;e of him; thy Servant will go and Fight with this Phili|stine,</HI> 1 Sam. 17. 23, 32. Yea, &s;uch a Man as &s;erves the Supreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth in &s;incerity and truth, and is a Soldier of the Holy Je&s;us in Deed, as well as Profe&s;&s;ion, will not only be ready to Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;t his Prince with what Mony he can po&s;&s;ibly, again&s;t an Enemy of Truth and Peace, but, with <HI>David,</HI> he will go him&s;elf, and defie that <HI>Philistine</HI> to his Face, who hath defied his God and his King. And &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, an Apo&s;tle, or rather chief of the Apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is not only ready to be Bound, but al&s;o to Die at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for the Name of his Ma&s;ter, and the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience: So that we who are, or have been, in the Wars, and have &s;hewed Courage for the Go&s;pel &s;ake, and again&s;t the Children of <HI>Babylon,</HI> need not to be ca&s;t down at the &s;harp reflections of &s;ome who pretend to be of our Church, but God knoweth their hearts, for they not only are remi&s;s them&s;elves, in &s;tirring up the people to be Couragious in Gods Cau&s;e, and be &s;tedfa&s;t and faithful unto
<PB N="25" REF="15"> Their Maje&s;ties in the&s;e times of War, but they take occa&s;ion to upbraid &s;uch as do their Duty in this Nature. For my own part, I mu&s;t &s;peak in the Go&s;pel words, <HI>He that is not with us,</HI> or for us, <HI>is</HI> undoubtedly <HI>against us.</HI> I can ea&s;ily prove this, for its a palpable Truth, That who&s;oever grows not daily in Grace, is going backwards from the Region of the Ble&s;&s;ed. Go we mu&s;t, and go we do daily, there is no &s;tanding &s;till, becau&s;e our Gla&s;s is running, and our Time flies away as a &s;wift Ship, or as the Eagle that ha&s;teth to the Prey. Either we mu&s;t walk in the Paths of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, or el&s;e, we mu&s;t wander in the broad way. So the&s;e clo&s;e &s;ort of People mu&s;t either follow God or <HI>Baal;</HI> they mu&s;t, and do, adhere more to Their Maje&s;ties, or el&s;e their Enemies in their Hearts, for they can ne|ver be Neuters in real Truth. And therefore he who always prai&s;es the <HI>French</HI> Arms, does Tacitly di&s;prai&s;e Their Maje&s;ties. He that Ju&s;tifies the Wicked, and he that Condemns the Ju&s;t, are equally an Abomination to the Lord, as <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17. 15. And the&s;e &s;ort of People are to be avoided. I confe&s;s, there are not lacking another &s;ort, who A&s;per&s;e, and have A&s;per&s;ed, this Saint-like Valour in the Servants of the mo&s;t High God, calling it Ignorance, Fool-hardine&s;s, Pride of Heart, and Folly; when as it is indeed, and in truth, nothing el&s;e but true Chri&s;tian Courage, or Fortitude, a Noble &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of Mind and Spirit, which will by no means warp, or &s;werve, from its Allegiance to our Governors, or be Terrified with any Humane Pui&s;&s;ance, or any outward Terriblene&s;s, or Amazements: No, nor will it be di&s;couraged at Death it &s;elf, or at all the Powers of Darkne&s;s. Such was that Courage of <HI>David,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff they Comfort me,</HI> P&s;al. 23. 4. It was an excellent An&s;wer, that a certain Eminent Servant of God, made unto one of the Emperours, when he was Threaten'd for his Religion, <HI>I fear not Impri&s;onment, becau&s;e I can have there as much freedom with my be&s;t Friends, as now when I am at liberty. As for Bani&s;hment, I defie it, for let me be driven into what terrible De&s;ert or Wilderne&s;s what&s;oever, yet there &s;hall I find my God. And I look upon this World it &s;elf to be a Bani&s;hment of us all, for our fir&s;t Parents Sin and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, Paradi&s;e being the true place of our Souls Na|tivity. And as for Death, I long for it, that I may Triumph over it, through Je&s;us Christ, (and what am I now but a mere Skeleton, even worn away to Skin and Bones,) and that is the pa&s;&s;age unto Eternal Life, and Everlasting Joy.</HI> Oh what can we &s;ay to all Pu&s;illanimous Per&s;ons, that are afraid to &s;erve the King, or their Country, in the Wars, that dare not tru&s;t the Almighty Lord with their Lives in a Camp, or Fleet, as well as here at home, al|though he is the pre&s;erver as well as giver thereof, <HI>For in God we live, in him we move, and in him we have our being,</HI> Acts 17. 28.

Every Revolu|tion which the Sun makes about the World, divides between Life and Death; &s;o that all tho&s;e Days which we have lived already are dead to us, and we &s;hall never live them over again, <HI>Currit mortalibus aevum, nec na&s;ci bis po&s;&s;e datur, fugit hora rapitque, Tartareus torrens, ac &s;ecum ferre &s;ub umbras, &s;iqua animo placuere negat</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>Poor Mortals! we form our very Words, of that which is mo&s;t near and dear to us, even the Breath of our No&s;trils, and therefore we have the le&s;s to live upon, for every word which we &s;peak, hence &s;aith the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, Chap. 2. ult. Cea&s;e ye from Man, who&s;e Breath is in his No|strils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</HI> The Philo&s;ophers Taught, That there was no greater Encouragement again&s;t all fear of Death, than to con&s;ider we mu&s;t needs Die: There is now an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity thereof, or el&s;e we cannot obtain Life Eternal, or come to the Glorious God of Life. And this was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Argument for to prove the Re&s;urrection, <HI>That which thou &s;owest is not quicken'd except it die.</HI> So the&s;e Natural Bodies mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved into Du&s;t and Corruption, before they can be made Spi|ritual, and like unto Chri&s;t's Glorious Body.
