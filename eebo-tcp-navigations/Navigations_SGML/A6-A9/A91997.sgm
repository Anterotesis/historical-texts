<HEAD>THE RESOLUTION Of the HOLLANDERS Concerning Their Fi&s;hermen in the Northern Seas; and the threat|ning Declaration of the people again&s;t their Magi|&s;trates. Al&s;o the particulars of a Fight at SEA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I acquainted you that a great fire had hap|pened in this Town; but could not then give you the certain Relation of the harm there done: I &s;hall there|fore endeavour to give you the more ample &s;atisfaction now: the manner thus. On the &s;eventh in&s;tant about two a Clock in the morning (ca&s;ually by accident) the Fire
<PB N="4" REF="3">took in the Town-hou&s;e, burning all the morning, and indeed mo&s;t part of the day with great violence, &s;o that notwith&s;tanding all the diligent and indu&s;trious care u&s;ed by the Magi&s;trate for the allaying and quenching the fu|rious flame, it prevailed &s;o far, that the whole Fabrick of that &s;tately Hou&s;e was burned down to the ground: Yet was it a wonder that it did no more mi&s;chief then it did. But the mercy and care of God for the fatherle&s;s did ap|pear, in that all the Deeds for Orphans were &s;aved, as al|&s;o the Records, and mo&s;t (if not all) of the Writings of the Bank, with many other Papers belonging to, and concerning particular per&s;ons. There were &s;ome Jews, who were more diligent about the Fire then was needful, for their diligence was onely a colour to their evil intent, viz. To carry away what they could get, &s;ome of them laying hold upon &s;everal bags of Duckats of a great va|lue, they were &s;u&s;pected and followed, and being &s;eized, &s;ome of the Gold was found about them: they &s;tand committed to Goale, and will &s;peedily be brought to a tryal, where they &s;hall (no doubt) receive the reward due to &s;o heinous a Crime, and be made exemplary to all &s;uch as come (in &s;uch ca&s;es) rather to &s;teal and carry away, then to help or comfort &s;uch as are afflicted. The Magi&s;trates cau&s;ed the City gates to be &s;hut all that day, and drew the Chains placing Guards about the City in all &s;uch places where conveniently they might. Many reports have been rai&s;ed touching the occa&s;ion of this Fire; divers are &s;u&s;pected to be the Authors thereof, but no certainty appeareth of any, but it is conjectured to be done of meer purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t di&s;parity both in the minds and faces of men here; &s;ome wi&s;hing peace and amity with England, but that party is incon&s;iderable; others &s;eek for nothing more then how to vent their rage again&s;t the Engli&s;h, yet
<PB N="5" REF="3">even the&s;e are not at one among&s;t them&s;elves, but are di|vided, &s;ome a&s;per&s;ing the States for not proceeding with more vigour in their cau&s;e, others again endeavouring to excu&s;e them; but all in general are again&s;t the Engli&s;h, &s;wearing, that their former Name and Reputation as Ma|&s;ters and Lords of the Sea mu&s;t and &s;hall have an end, and that they mu&s;t not think always to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which ought to be free and common to all.</P>
<P>Here is lately come News, That the Engli&s;h Admiral hath been among our Bu&s;&s;es in the North, and that he hath &s;eized upon great numbers of them (though not without &s;trong oppo&s;ition, there having been a &s;harp di&s;pute for about 3 hours, between the Engli&s;h party and the Durch Men of war that were for their Guard) &s;ome &s;ay 130 Bu&s;&s;es, &s;ome &s;ay more, be&s;ides 4 Men of War, and one &s;unk; but al&s;o that the Engli&s;h have lo&s;t 2 Men of War, very gallant Frigats. I cannot aver this for truth, but it pa&s;&s;eth currantly here; in&s;omuch that the Bores fearing to be half &s;tarved for want of their Fi&s;hing, arm them|&s;elves apace, and grow very de&s;perate, Declaring, <HI>That if their Lords do not provide &s;ome &s;peedy remedy in this Ca&s;e, they will pull them out of their hou&s;es headlong, and tear them peece-meal.</HI> So that they dare hardly &s;hew them&s;elvs.</P>
<P>Great is the talk here of Vantrumps return into the Downs again with above 100 &s;ail of lu&s;ty &s;tout &s;hips (having &s;ent 70 more towards the North parts to en|counter with Gen. Blake, and free their Fi&s;hermen from him. Mean time he with his Fleet will attend the motion of the Engli&s;h in the Downs, and fall upon, &s;ink, burn and de&s;troy them as he can light on them; as al&s;o to keep o|thers from comming to joyn with them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE hear from Piccardy that the Count de Fuen|&s;ardagn who is General of the Spani&s;h army, af|ter many days march is come to Noyen, a Town di&s;tant about 22 leagues from hence, which put them all to a great fear, thinking they intended to have be&s;ieged it, but it proved otherwi&s;e, for they turned a&s;ide to a place cal|led Chauni, where having made their approaches, the Town was compelled to yield at mercy, there was many per&s;ons of quality found therein, as the Duke Delbeuf, the chief Mar&s;hal Manicamp, and many others; it is thought that &s;ince the &s;aid General is &s;ate down with his army before Noyon, which he intends to take in with Roy and Mendidier. The 17 in&s;tant, the King and all the Court departed from St. Dennis, and went to Penthoi&s;e, which is a Town in the road between this City and Roan; it doth not hold true concerning the departing of the Cardinal, he having onely plaid lea&s;t in &s;ight for a while the better to beguile the Princes and this City, before the Commi&s;&s;ioners had audience, where after many words pa&s;&s;ed, he de&s;ired them to come to Penthoi&s;e, which having denied, the King moved that they would &s;end to the Parliament, that they may &s;end a greater number of Commi&s;&s;ioners, and al&s;o the Princes, that they might come to a conference, and &s;eek the means to compo&s;e all differences; the Commi&s;&s;ioners thus remaining at St. Dennis, as they were de&s;ired, &s;ent an expre&s;&s;e to acquaint
<PB N="7" REF="4">the Parliament of what had pa&s;&s;ed, who thereupon orde|red that they &s;hould return without delay; and &s;o make their report to the hou&s;e: and the next day the Prince of Conde went in per&s;on with 800 hor&s;e to bring them home, and the Duke of Orleans went al&s;o out of this City with many attendants, and met them on the way, and &s;o they came to this City, where all manner of pro|vi&s;ion chiefly bread, are &s;till at an exce&s;&s;ive rate, the poor people being brought to a very great extremity. The 18 the Parliament being &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, all the Chambers a&s;&s;embled, the Commi&s;&s;ioners made a large report of that had pa&s;|&s;ed at Court, and afterwards they entred upon debate of many great bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, chiefly of that which concerneth the appointing the Duke of Orleans as Regent or Protect|our of France during the Kings detention by his mother and the Cardinal, the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is not as yet perfected, therefore not pa&s;&s;ed as was reported. The Spani&s;h army is &s;till in the River of Bourdeaux, their General the Lord Vateuille having fortified Bourg near Bourdeaux, and placed there a &s;trong Gari&s;on, and now going for Boarg, to joyn with the Count du Daugnon, that &s;o they may be able to encounter the Kings Fleet, who is daily expec|ted under the command of the Duke of Vendo&s;m, who is High Admiral of France.</P>
<P>We hear from Bourdeaux, that tho&s;e that are called of the Elm-hou&s;e get dayly more authority; being a&s;|&s;embled the 7th in&s;tant it was re&s;olved, That the four|teen Officers or Members of Parliament which were ba|ni&s;hed and called in again, &s;hould again depart the City, That the Jurats and other &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, &s;hould be laid hold on, and carried forthwith to pri&s;on, and &s;ome to be bani&s;hed during life.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, Here is great hopes of a &s;peedy &s;ettlement of the&s;e parts, the chiefe&s;t of the Gentry tendring their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Commonwealth of England. The di&s;|cipline of war is exerci&s;ed very &s;trictly among&s;t our &s;ol|diers to keep them from &s;tragling and plundering. A Court Martial was held in the field near Blair, where many were tried, three or four for Life and Death, but &s;u&s;pended till further proof: Eight received &s;entence for &s;tragling from their colours, and plundering: One of them to be hanged on &s;uch a manner, that he might &s;tand on tip toes, and to receive a la&s;h as every Divi&s;ion of the Regiment pa&s;&s;ed by, and to have his Ear cut, and to be ca&s;hiered the Army; another was &s;entenced to be hang|ed by the arm-pits while&s;t the Regiment marched by; A third to be tied to a tree, and to receive thirty &s;tripes. Here is little News concerning General Blake and his na|vy, onely that he hath taken many Bu&s;&s;es, and one or two Men of War that were for a Guard to them; &s;ome of them he hath &s;ent towards Dunbar, where in &s;hort &s;pace (we do not doubt) but they will well and &s;afely ar|rive.</P>
