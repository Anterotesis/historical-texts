<HEAD>A STEP TO THE BATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Town, and its Diver&s;ions, being grown as Stale as a Ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;s; and the chiefe&s;t of its Inhabitants withdrawn to their Ru|ral Plea&s;ures; and Duns as Impudent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>D</HI>&mdash; the <HI>Poulterian Officer:</HI> So that being bereav'd of the one, &amp; damnably Fatigu'd by the other; Nece&s;&s;ity, the Mother of Invention, oblig'd me to take a Country Journey, for Self-Pre&s;ervation &s;ake; having Money to <HI>Spend,</HI> tho' none to <HI>Pay.</HI> And the la&s;t Summers Expedition at the <HI>Wells,</HI> not agreeing with my pre|&s;ent Con&s;titution, and my Inclinations being bent after Novelties, I re&s;olv'd to Steer my Cour&s;e <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> to &s;ee what Plea&s;ure tho&s;e <HI>Pools of Iniquity,</HI> call'd the <HI>BATH,</HI> would afford me. In order for which, I pre&s;ently took Hack, and bid him drive me to that terrible Sign, the <HI>Sarazens-Head</HI> in <HI>Fryday-Street,</HI> where I gave Earne&s;t for a Place in the following <HI>Mondays</HI> Coach; but being <HI>Saturday,</HI> and late in the Sea&s;on, I thought I &s;hould have no rea&s;on to Cur&s;e my Company, for mine was the fir&s;t that was taken: But my Tun-Belly'd Ho&s;te&s;s, to Encourage me, &s;aid, <HI>That not|with&s;tanding 'twas &s;o late in the Week, &s;he doubted not but there would be more Places taken before Night.</HI></P>
<P>In hopes of which, I left her, to prepare for my approaching Journey; and Money being the Life of the Cau&s;e, I mu&s;ter'd up a pretty tolerable Sum, and for conveni|ency of Carriage, converted it into the Noble&s;t of Metals. Then I began to think of the Redemption of &s;everal Captivated Nece&s;&s;aries, which an Unlucky Accident had brought into Bondage; as an <HI>&V;ltramarine Jo&s;eph,</HI> a Pocket Monitor of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s Compo&s;ing, and a Silver Hilted <HI>Ripp</HI> of the <HI>I&s;ebrook</HI>'s Temper; three as nece&s;&s;ary Implements for a <HI>Traveller,</HI> as <HI>Goo&s;e, Yard,</HI> and <HI>Sheers,</HI> for a <HI>Taylor.</HI> Well, to <HI>Egypt</HI> I went, and Redeem'd them from Slavery.</P>
<P>And by rea&s;on I would be ready on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, I went to Lye at the Inn on <HI>Sunday</HI> Night; and Enquiring of the Tap&s;ter what Company I was like to have, he &s;aid more he believ'd than I de&s;ir'd; for there was four Places taken ju&s;t after I went, and three of the Pa&s;&s;engers were in the Hou&s;e, and to lie there that Night; the other was for a Merchant of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> Then asking what tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e were, he told me two Gentlewomen and their Maid Servant, who were ju&s;t going to Supper. Whereupon I bid him go and give my Service to 'em, and tell 'em I was to Travel with 'em to Morrow, and &s;hould take it as a great Favour, if they would plea&s;e to Honour me &s;o far, as to Admit me into their Company, for I was alone. The Fellow brought Word they de&s;ir'd me to Walk in, and they &s;hould be very glad of mine.
<PB N="4" REF="3">This being what I wanted, in I went; and after a few Ceremonial Complements, and Begging Pardon for my Rudene&s;s, I told them I was afraid I &s;hould have gone alone, but now I found I &s;hould be Ble&s;s'd beyond my Hopes, in having the Ho|nour, or rather Happine&s;s, of their good Company. <HI>I Wi&s;h, Sir,</HI> reply'd one of them, <HI>It may an&s;wer your Expectation, for our Sex is counted but very indifferent Company to Tra|vel with, and you are like to be Fatigu'd with three of us.</HI> As for Children, and Te&s;ty Age, Madam, an&s;wer'd I, I agree in the Opinion; but otherwi&s;e, condemn it as Erroneous: And for your Number, The More the Merrier. <HI>That's according as it proves, Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he; <HI>neither would I have you Flatter your &s;elf too &s;oon, lea&s;t your hopes &s;hould prove abortive, but rather referr you to old</HI> Saffold<HI>'s Advice,</HI> Read, Try, Judge, and &s;peak as you find. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Madam, an&s;wer'd I, Experience is the only Touch-&s;tone; but I &s;hall be mightily deceiv'd in my Politicks, if it does not make good my A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>I Pre&s;ume, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the other Lady, <HI>You have Studyed</HI> Saunders, <HI>and are well Vers'd in</HI> Phy&s;iognomy, <HI>or you could never pretend to &s;o much Fore-knowledge.</HI> At which I Crav'd the Honour of &s;eeing her Hand, telling her, I had &s;ome little Skill in <HI>Palme&s;try,</HI> by which Art I perceiv'd &s;he requir'd not much Ca&s;tration; which made them both Laugh: And the fir&s;t Lady ask'd me, if I had any Skill in <HI>Chiromancy,</HI> for the &s;ame Author Profe&s;t both. I told her no; but was &s;atisfied &s;he had; for her Charms had rais d &s;uch a Spirit in me, that I knew not how to lay it without her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>I never under&s;tood</HI> Magick, <HI>I Prote&s;t, Sir,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>and am mightily afraid of a Spirit: Therefore let's Di&s;cour&s;e no more of &s;uch &V;nruly things, that neither of to know how to Govern.</HI> Your Power is as ab&s;olute in Laying as in Rai&s;ing of them, Lady, an&s;wer'd I; but &s;ince 'tis your Plea&s;ure, your Command &s;hall be Obey'd, and I'll &s;hape my Di&s;cour&s;e to what Subject you Plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But Supper coming in, they de&s;ir'd me to &s;it down with them, and having more Manners than to refu&s;e &s;o good a Proffer, I comply'd with their Reque&s;t, and fed very Heartily. The Gla&s;s went Briskly about, that we were as Merry, as a Knot of Jovial Tinkers over a Cup of Nappy-Ale, and I began to like my Company extraor|dinary well&punc; but the Charming Inchantre&s;s and I, interchang'd &s;o many learing Ogles, that I could hardly mind our Di&s;cour&s;e; yet I under&s;tood &s;o much, that &s;he was a <HI>Widow,</HI> the other a <HI>Wife,</HI> and both Si&s;ters, and al&s;o Strangers to the Place they were going to, as well as I; and had no other Call but Recreation; But I was for fulfil|ling the Scriptures, in Comforting the <HI>Widow.</HI> Supper being ended, they call'd for a Bill, which was pre&s;ently brought; out I lugg'd, and was going to Di&s;charge, but they begg'd my Pardon, and would by no means &s;uffer me; telling me I mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the Rule that is generally ob&s;erv'd in Travelling, for the <HI>Major</HI> of either Sex to Treat the <HI>Minor.</HI> I mu&s;t Acknowledge, Ladies, &s;aid I, 'tis an Old Cu&s;tome &s;o to do, but we are not now on the Road; however that Avail'd not, they pleaded the Prerogative of the Majority, and carry'd it <HI>Nolens Volens.</HI> Seeing they were &s;o Re|&s;olute. I di&s;penc'd with the Affront, con&s;idering I had often put up a greater, and would not pre&s;s too hard, lea&s;t it &s;hould prevail; but that was a needle&s;s Thought, for the Young Widow drew from between her Snowy Brea&s;ts, a Pur&s;e Cramm'd as full of <HI>Yellow-Boys,</HI> as a Clerk of a Markets Bag of <HI>Copper John</HI>'s, and Di&s;charg'd the whole. Seeing of which, I thought I could do no le&s;s in Honour than call for my Flask; Craving Leave to pre&s;ent them with it as my Foy; and being a little Elevated with the Noble Juice, we were as Jocund and Frolick&s;ome, as a Countrey-Vicar at a Go&s;&s;iping. In came the Wine, without di&s;puting who &s;hould pay for it. But at la&s;t, Night, the Lovers Bli&s;s, and Bane of good Company, Oblig'd us to with|draw to our Chambers. Upon which, I told the Ladies, I &s;hould think the time ve|ry tedious till I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to Enjoy their good Company again. <HI>We are apter to believe Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd they, <HI>You will think the Journey &s;o, by rea&s;on of the Dull|ne&s;s of it.</HI> Say what I will, Ladies, &s;aid I, you Foy'l me with my own Weapons, and are pleas'd to Retort my Words to their own Centre. So after a profound Cringe or two, with a Gripe of the Paw, and as many Amorous Glances at my Charming Widow, who return'd me the like, we parted: But never any happy Bridegroom Long'd for the Approaching Night, more than I for the &s;ucceeding Morning.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had I enter'd my Chamber, but I found a Secret Pa&s;&s;ion had po&s;&s;e&s;t my Soul, and I was all on Fire: Ye Powers, cry'd I, what &s;trange Fever's this that Rages
<PB N="5" REF="3">in my Brea&s;t, and Riots in my Blood? Not Liquid Fire, by its fir&s;t Cau&s;e Fomented, burns Fiercer in Earths Center, than I flame within. Tame this Unruly Flame, or touch her Heart that fir&s;t Kindl'd it, with a Cole from the &s;ame Altar. Nay 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to relate how violent my Pa&s;&s;ion rag'd; but in Love I was, that's certain; but whether her Pur&s;e or Per&s;on begat this Flame, is a very Nice Que&s;tion, and I prote&s;t I know not; for, as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q><L>Gold alone does Pa&s;&s;ion move;</L>
<L>Gold Monopolizes Love.</L></Q>
<P>For Gold has Unre&s;i&s;table Charms as well as Beauty; is of a Corroding Quality; of an Attractive Nature, and bears a great influence o'er the Opticks. And 'twas very probable that Pur&s;e was only Prologue to a far greater Sum; &s;o by con&s;equence mu&s;t needs have &s;ome Operation; not but the Ladies were both very Amiable, in the Bloom of Vigorous Youth, bore a good A&s;pect, had no mean Air, Free, and without Re&s;erve in their Conver&s;ation; and their Deportment declar'd them of no Vulgar Quality. But the Charming Golden Widow was the Idol of my Soul, Subject of my Thoughts, and Center of my Wi&s;hes; Mu&s;ing on whom, at la&s;t dull <HI>Morpheus</HI> Seal'd my Eyes, to relieve my Captivated Sen&s;es.</P>
<Q><L>But, Oh ye Gods! No Re&s;t could I obtain,</L>
<L>The Charming Fair, did o'er my Slumbers Reign;</L>
<L>And in &s;trange Dreams Augment my Rapid Flame.</L></Q>
<P>By that time Forked <HI>Cynthia</HI> had withdrawn her influence, and bright <HI>Aurora</HI> ro&s;e from <HI>Thetis</HI> Lap, I &s;hook off the Drow&s;y God, and ble&s;t the joyful Day. Looking out of my Window, I perceiv'd they were preparing for our Journey, which made me Rig with all imaginable &s;peed; and as I was going down, who &s;hould I meet but my Cherubimical Widdow, equip'd like a Godde&s;s, and Adorn'd with Ribbon like the Fore-Hor&s;e of a Country-Team? After we had given each other the Time of the Day, <HI>Lord Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Are you but ju&s;t up? Why we are almo&s;t Ready to go; certainly you Slept very Sound.</HI> No Madam an&s;wer'd I, &s;ince I have had the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, Re&s;t has been a &s;tranger to my Bre&s;t. <HI>Have I di&s;turbed you Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he? <HI>If &s;o, I ask your Pardon, and am &s;orry for it.</HI> Ye Gods, cry'd I, what &s;hall I &s;ay? Or how &s;hall I expre&s;s my &s;elf? In&s;pire my Tongue with Eloquence, thou God of Love, to make her &s;en&s;ible of my Pain. Oh Madam, cry'd I, you are Innocent of your Crime, and Guilty of the Fact: You have Robb'd me of my Re&s;t, Fir'd my Blood, and Stolen my Heart; &s;ee how it Hovers o'er your Panting Brea&s;t, and fain would gain Admit|tance. <HI>I Vow Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>Your Di&s;cour&s;e is &s;o My&s;terious, that it wants another</HI> Oedi|pus <HI>to unfold. And for what you are Pleas'd to charge me withal, is a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation; nei|ther have I Vacancy to Entertain it.</HI> Ah Madam, reply'd I, I could &s;oon convince you of your Error, if you would give me leave to &s;earch in a certain Corner you have about you, that &s;hall be Namele&s;s. At which &s;he Blu&s;h'd, and told me I was mighti|ly Mi&s;taken: But allow it &s;o, &s;ince 'twas Ignorantly committed, and without any premeditated de&s;ign, &s;he hop'd I would be &s;o generous as to Forgive her. Never Madam, &s;aid I, unle&s;s you vouch&s;afe to ca&s;t an Eye of Pity, and Commi&s;erate the Condition of your Langui&s;hing Lover, on whom the God of Love, if there be any &s;uch a Diety, hath Empty'd his whole Artillery, and pierc'd my Heart with your all-Conquering Eyes: <HI>O Fye, Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>this is meer Railery, and only for your Diver&s;ion, a thing Cu&s;tomary with you General Lovers, in whom every New Face Creates a new Flame; of the Libertines Opinion, that a Woman, after &s;he is once Enjoy'd, grows Dull and In&s;ipid; and what you have now &s;o &s;olemnly pretended to me, is no more then you have already done to half our Sex, if po&s;&s;ible; and &s;uch I take it.</HI></P>
<P>By my Soul I thought &s;he was a Witch by her gue&s;&s;ing &s;o right, and was a going to tell her &s;o, for every Syllable &s;he utter'd was as true as an Oracle. But finding by her Parlying I had made a Breach, I re&s;olv'd to Storm the Ca&s;tle. If you Har|bour any &s;uch thought of me, Madam, an&s;wer'd I, by Heaven you do me wrong; for &s;o pure is my Flame, and &s;o A&s;&s;iduous my Pa&s;&s;ion, without you give me &s;peedy
<PB N="6" REF="4">hopes, I &s;hall fall a Sacrifice to your di&s;dain, and <HI>Phoenix</HI>-like, expire in my own Flames. <HI>'Tis but Breathing a Vein Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>and your Feavour will &s;oon abate.</HI> Oh Madam, cry'd I, how can you be &s;o Cruel? You gave the Wound, but Admi|ni&s;ter a contrary Cure. Wrack me no longer thus with Doubts and Fears, either retaliate me in the &s;ame Nature, or pronounce my Doom; for on your Lips my Fate depends. <HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>that requires more Con&s;ideration than the time will ad|mit of now: Yet take this for your Satisfaction, if your Character and Quality an&s;wers your Appearance, and your Pa&s;&s;ion be real, you need not di&s;pond of the Entertainment of that Tri&s;le you are plea&s;ed to Charge me withal, but it &s;hall find a Reception Suitable to its Merits.</HI> At which &s;he Sigh'd, and &s;aid our Company waited for us, but in the Evening would take an Opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e further of it. Now Madam, you have rui&s;ed my drooping Spirits to an Exta&s;ie of Joy, an&s;wer'd I; Pardon my Pre&s;umption, and Ab|rupt proceeding, I be&s;eech you, in taking this opportunity to reveal my Pa&s;&s;ion, and impute it to nothing but Love, Almighty Love, for what will not a &s;inking Wretch catch hold on, to &s;ave his Mi&s;erable Life?</P>
<P>At which we &s;eparated, and joyn'd our Company, who were preparing for an An|tidote again&s;t Fa&s;ting, which we had &s;carcely compleated, but were call'd on to Board our Leathern-Conveniency, and were Pen'd up like the Bea&s;ts in the Ark; but I took care to have my Mi&s;tre&s;s my Oppo&s;ite, and being &s;ettled, <HI>Whip</HI> proceeded on his Journey, and having a plentiful Mornings Draught&punc; Tickled his Cittel, drove like <HI>Jehu,</HI> and &s;oon convey'd us to the Sign of <HI>Englands Champion</HI> at <HI>Cole-brook,</HI> an Inn famous for an Ho&s;te&s;s, and Extravagant Bills for &s;hort Commons.</P>
<P>Having refre&s;h'd our &s;elves with a good Breakfa&s;t, we re-enter'd our Coop, and was but very indifferent Company, for our <HI>Ma&s;culine</HI> Traveller, the Married Lady, and Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> the Chamber-Maid, had a Long Game at Noddy: However it pre&s;ented me with &s;everal Opportunities of Saluting my Widow, and Exerci&s;e a|bundance of Falm Letchery; but being come to <HI>Reading,</HI> we Din'd at the <HI>Canoni|cal-Nabb,</HI> where our Landlord was as Remarkable for his Bulk, as our late Ho&s;te&s;s for her Tail; formerly he was a profe&s;t Bapti&s;t, but being cho&s;en one of the Head Loobies of the Corporation, he renounc'd his Religion, Embrac'd the Faith, and was Chri&s;tned <HI>Lumpus;</HI> his Corps is of the &s;ize of a <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> Mea&s;ures full three Yards in the Wa&s;te, and his Legs bigger about than the Piers of the Town Bridge; the Doctor of the Pari&s;h hath excommunicated him from the Church; becau&s;e his Snor|ring not only drowns his Voice, but di&s;turbs the whole Congregation. Being de|priv'd of the Church, he then took the Fle&s;h, and is reported to have overlaid three of his Servants. Having now &s;tock'd our &s;elves with &s;ub&s;tantial Belly-Timber, and Liquor'd our Whi&s;tles, we pur&s;u'd our Journey, and were more Sociable; the La|dies oblig'd as with &s;everal Songs, which they perform'd with an Excellent Voice, and good Judgment: But my Thoughts were chiefly Ruminating on the Fair Object before me, and how to manage my Amour at Night, every fre&s;h Glance di&s;covered conceal'd Beauties, nor was &s;he un&s;en&s;ible of my Angui&s;h, for her repeated Sighs betray'd her yielding Heart.</P>
<Q><L>Oh what Caele&s;tial Motion had her Eyes!</L>
<L>Her Panting Brea&s;ts, how they did fall and ri&s;e!</L>
<L>Con&s;piring both to fall my Sacrifice.</L></Q>
<P>And our Merchant took Notice of her Sighs, and ask'd her the Rea&s;on; &s;he told him 'twas only a Fooli&s;h Cu&s;tom; but I believe had he ask'd me, I could have given him a better Account. But come, Fellow-Travellers, &s;aid he, will you plea&s;e to take a Dram of Right <HI>Nants?</HI> A good Cordial on the Road, and will dige&s;t our Dinner; I prote&s;t I forgot it in the Morning: So we accepted of his kindne&s;s, and drain'd his Bottle: But Promi&s;ed to recruit it the fir&s;t opportunity; and to pa&s;s the time a|way, we Engag'd Mrs <HI>Pert</HI> to Sing a Song, and our Merchant and I promis'd to tell a Story: She Pleaded &s;he could not Sing, but would oblige us in relating a very &s;trange Accident lately di&s;cover'd; which was as followeth.</P>
<P>About fifteen year &s;ince, There was a noted Trade&s;man near <HI>Aldgate,</HI> had two Chil|dren, a Son and Daughter, the Son was Aged about fifteen Years, and the Daughter
<PB N="7" REF="4">twelve; he had a de&s;ire to put his Son Prentice to &s;ome good Trade in the City, and gave him his choice, but he was very much A ver&s;e to it, his Inclinations being al|together for the Sea, and nothing would &s;erve him but a <HI>Tarpaulin</HI> Ma&s;ter. At la&s;t his Father with much Regret Con&s;ented to it, and put him to a Ma&s;ter of a Ship that was bound for a Trading Voyage up the <HI>Streights:</HI> At which the Young Man was Extraordinary Glad, took Leave of his Friends, and went Aboard with great Joy; but before three Months was Expir'd, News arriv'd that they were taken by the <HI>Algerines,</HI> from whom at that time there was no Redemption: The News of which, and a Con&s;iderable Lo&s;s the Old Man had lately Su&s;tain'd by Fire, not only Re|duc'd his Condition to a mean Sub&s;i&s;tance, but broke his Heart, nor did his Wife long Survive him; and with the remains of their decay'd Fortune, the Poor <HI>Orphan</HI> was put to a Semp&s;tre&s;s; but before her Time was Expir'd, one of <HI>Exeter</HI> fell in Love with her, Marry'd her, and took her with him to <HI>Exon,</HI> unknown to her Friends or Acquaintance; in a few Years after he left her a Widow, no Children, and but little to Tru&s;t to; which to improve, &s;he &s;et up her Trade, and maintain'd her &s;elf very Hand&s;omely, Living in good Credit. But her Unhappy Brother, who had the Misfortune to be a Slave, was bought by one that Liv'd &s;ever. Leagues up in the Country, never having any Opportunity of &s;ending to <HI>England,</HI> his Friends di&s;pair'd of ever &s;eeing him again, and gave him over for Lo&s;t. But &s;ee how Providence Order'd it, his Ma&s;ter Dyed, and by rea&s;on he had been a good Ser|vant, not only Bequeath'd him his Liberty, but al&s;o a great Sum of Money to Main|tain him; and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who had often given him &s;everal Evident Te&s;timonies of her Affections, wou'd have Marry'd him, provided he would Renounce his Re|ligion, and Embrace the <HI>Mabometan,</HI> which he deny'd to do; but her Love was &s;o Violent, or rather Lu&s;t &s;o Raging, that it over-flow'd the Bounds of Mode&s;ty, and by the Allurements of her Gold, intic'd him to &s;atisfie her Exorbitant De&s;ires, by which means he had gottten a very Con&s;iderable E&s;tate. But the Natural Incli|nation for his own Native Country, and great De&s;ire to &s;ee his Friends, out-Ballanc'd the Embraces of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Gold was more prevailing than her Charms, and came the fir&s;t Opportunity for <HI>England,</HI> and in a &s;hort time Arriv'd at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> the next day reach'd <HI>Exon;</HI> and having pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for &s;ome Linnen, he Ac|cidentally goes into his Unknown Si&s;ters Shop and furni&s;h'd him&s;elf, then Po&s;ts for <HI>London;</HI> where to his great Grief, he found, as I have already Related; and by no meant could get any Information of his Si&s;ter, his long Ab&s;ence not only bereav'd him of his Friends, but al&s;o of all his former Acquaintance; that he was become an <HI>Alien</HI> in the Place of his Nativity. The Deprivation of which, was an extra|ordinary Trouble to him, and the only way to Redre&s;s it, he thought would be to Alter his Condition; he Coveted not Riches, but Content, to Compen&s;ate for his hard Fate. But, Oh, how often are we Deceiv'd in our Expectations, and our hopes Fru&s;trated by an All-Seeing Power? His Fancy pre&s;ented none &s;o Charming to his Eyes as the <HI>Exeter</HI> Widow: Nay, &s;o great was his Pa&s;&s;ion, that immediately he goes down, Courts her, and in a &s;hort time Married her, brings her up to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> takes a Hou&s;e, and Liv'd very Happily together, had two Children by her; and no Di&s;cour&s;e as yet of their Parents happened between them. But &s;ee how Fate Ordain'd it! Not long &s;ince, as he was Walking by <HI>Fleet-Ditch,</HI> he e&s;pies his Fa|thers Picture Expos'd to Sale among Old Goods; which pre&s;ently he Bought, and made a very &s;trict Enquiry where they had it, thinking thereby to trace his Si&s;ter, but 'twas &s;o long &s;ince they bought it, that they could give him no Account; how|ever, he imputed it to be a very Lucky Accident, had it brought home with him, and with abundance of Joy &s;hows it his Wife. Telling her, 'twas the Picture of his Father, and how Accidentally he came by it: At which, &s;he was mightily &s;urpris'd, and told him, <HI>If that was the Picture of his Father, (which Heaven forbid) &s;he was his own Natural Si&s;ter:</HI> He A&s;toni&s;h'd at this dreadful News, ask'd her a few more que&s;tions, &s;he Re&s;olving of which, Confirm'd the Di&s;covery, and hath Involv'd them into a great deal of Trouble and Con&s;ternation of Mind; for the Ea&s;ement of which, they have had the Opinion of &s;everal Learned Divines; who advi&s;e them to joyn no more in their Ince&s;tuous Bed, but Live after the Natural Bonds of Affinity, and &s;ince 'twas Ignorantly Committed, it mitigated the Crime, and they were more to be
<PB N="8" REF="5">Pittyed; and none could be &s;o Barbarous, as to reflect on their Unhappy Off-Spring. But 'tis to be Fear'd, it will prove Fatal to them both, for they Labour under an Agony of Mind, that nothing but Death or Di&s;traction is Expected.</P>
<P>Her Story being Ended, the Ladies Confirm'd it, and declar'd they knew the Par|ties; and it had not been Di&s;cover'd above two or three Years; but while we were Commi&s;erating their hard Fate, we came to a Vilage call'd <HI>Theal,</HI> and &s;topt at Old <HI>Mother Cleanly</HI>'s, at the Sign of the <HI>Divine Clamour;</HI> as Noted a Hou&s;e for Bottle-Ale and Plumb-Cakes, as the <HI>Folly</HI> on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> for bad Wine, and Lewd Whores: Nay, <HI>Sla&s;h</HI> declar'd he dares no more pa&s;s by without calling, than the Forked Animals mi&s;s <HI>Cuchold's-Point,</HI> in their Journey to <HI>Horn-Fair:</HI> But having participated, and given our Approbation on her Commodity, we Travel'd on, and our <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Merchant told us, he pre&s;um'd we were a going to the <HI>BATH</HI> for Diver&s;ion; but his Journey to <HI>London</HI> was &s;uch a Novelty, that 'twas &s;carce to be Parallel'd, and notwith&s;tanding it had occa&s;ion'd him a great deal of Trouble, it might Divert us; with that we de&s;ir'd him to Relate it, which he pre&s;ently did, after this manner:</P>
<P>The Place of my Habitation you already know, of which I have been a Merchant almo&s;t this thirty year, am a Widower and have &s;everal Children, but my Elde&s;t Son being very De&s;irous to Live at <HI>London,</HI> I put him to an Eminent Draper in <HI>C</HI>&mdash;, but before he had Serv'd half his Time, he kept &s;uch high Company, and was Ac|quainted with &s;o many Rakes of the Town, that his Ma&s;ter was as weary of him, as he of his Ma&s;ter; &s;o I was oblig'd to take him Home, and De&s;ign'd to bring him up a Merchant, but the Infection he receiv'd at <HI>London,</HI> made too great an Impre&s;|&s;ion to be Di&s;charg'd by my Documents, which often occa&s;ion'd no &s;mall differ|ence between us; about a Month &s;ince, having &s;ome very Urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Wales,</HI> which requir'd my Ab&s;ence for at lea&s;t twelve or fourteen Days, I left my Daughter to manage my Dome&s;tick, and he my other Affairs, and took my Journey; but that Night I left him, he &s;ends Word to all my Corre&s;pondents at <HI>London,</HI> that I was Dead, (as I under&s;tand &s;ince) and that he &s;hould be with them in a &s;hort time, for his Father having left him a Plentiful E&s;tate, he de&s;ign'd to leave off Merchandi|zing. This News Startl'd my Acquaintance, and they &s;ent him &s;everal Letters of Condolence; and my Death pa&s;t as Currant on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> as if it had been &s;worn by twenty <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Witne&s;&s;es. My Daughter who kept my Ca&s;h, &s;ent him a Letter of Advice, of the Payment of &s;ome Bills, I had lately drawn on him, which he receiv'd and an&s;wer'd; he al&s;o Intercepted the Letters I &s;ent his Si&s;ter, and about &s;ix days before I came Home, takes fifty Pound of my Hou&s;e Ca&s;h and Po&s;ts for <HI>London,</HI> and before he Appear'd Publick, Cloths him&s;elf in deep Mourning, Vi&s;its my Corre|&s;pondents, tells them he came to Admini&s;ter to his Fathers Will, and Ballance Ac|counts, and takes up of my Gold&s;mith 1300 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> who pay'd it him all in Gold, as he reque&s;ted; having Accompli&s;h'd his Ends, Ca&s;t off his Mourning, New Rigg'd, and now I hear he is gone for <HI>Rome,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the <HI>Jubilee;</HI> but when I came home, mi&s;|&s;ing of him and my Money, I pre&s;ently Conjectur'd he was gone for <HI>London,</HI> and was afraid he would take up more, therefore made all the &s;peed I could after him, to prevent it, but he was too Nimble for me; my Acquaintance was all po&s;&s;e&s;t with a Pannick Fear, and &s;o &s;urpriz'd, that they took me for a Spirit, and wou'd harldly believe their own Eyes; but I &s;oon Convinc'd them of their Mi&s;take, and they me of my Sons Proceedings.</P>
<P>And this is Generally the Product of &s;ending our Children to <HI>London:</HI> Well, had I forty, I'd never &s;end any of them to <HI>London</HI> again: Now he is gone Loaded with Gold to <HI>Rome;</HI> Perhaps, about a Year or two hence, I &s;hall have him return, as <HI>Light</HI> as a <HI>Common-Strumpet,</HI> as <HI>Shabby</HI> as a <HI>Broken Officer,</HI> and as <HI>Foppi&s;h</HI> as a <HI>City Beau;</HI> but I will never Look on him again.

<P>But being come to the rocky De&s;cent into <HI>Marlborough,</HI> we were &s;o Damnably jolt|ed, that our Merchants Pocket Comfort Vani&s;h'd and the Brittle Metal was &s;hatter'd into a thou&s;and pieces; for the Lo&s;s of which, I intail'd &s;uch a Hearty Cur&s;e on the Place, that never &s;ince hath a Coach pa&s;t, but it Over-turn'd, a Waggon or Cart, but it breaks either Wheel or Axeltree, a Hor&s;e, but he Stumbles; and all the Bea&s;ts that Graze near it, Die of the <HI>Murraine:</HI> At la&s;t with the help of a couple of Gigan|tick Loobies, to &s;upport our Tottering Caravan, we got into the Town, and tipt them a <HI>Hogg</HI> for our &s;afe Conduct.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> we broke our fa&s;t at the <HI>Royal-Diadem,</HI> and had Mr. <HI>Mayor</HI> for our Landlord, a good jolly <HI>Bachanalian,</HI> who hath be&s;tow'd more in adorn|ing his Fiz, than the Market-hou&s;e co&s;t Building; &amp; being a Magi&s;trate, I made a hea|vy Complaint again&s;t that Cur&s;ed Hill, demanded &s;atisfaction for the dammage we had &s;u&s;tain'd, in breaking our Brandy Bottle, and told him, unle&s;s they took &s;peedy Care to have it mended, I would Indite the whole Corporation. <HI>That we cannot do by no means, Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>For in &s;o doing we &s;hould Ruine half the Town; for the dam|mage that Hill occa&s;ions, brings a Con&s;iderable Trade to our</HI> Wheel-wrights, Farriers, <HI>and</HI> Chyrurgions; <HI>al&s;o Creates no &s;mall Bu&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e of my own Function, and Main|tains three or four Families to &s;upport the Coaches, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at other Accidents: But however, I'll pre&s;ent you with a fre&s;h Cargo, and Advi&s;e you to take more Care for the future:</HI> Before we had Breakfa&s;ted, he was as good as his Word; but to retalliate his Kindne&s;s, we call'd for two or three Flasks Extraordinary.</P>
<P>Having lay'd a good Foundation to Travel on, we quitted <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and &s;oon came on a curious Down, much Noted for its Flocks of <HI>Grey Weathers,</HI> which often gave us Confounded Jolts, and put us in Mind of our Landlords Caution, concerning our Bottle. But before we had Rod five Mile, we receiv'd Information of a Party of <HI>Light-Hor&s;e</HI> that lay Perdue to Ea&s;e us of our <HI>Rino.</HI> This News made us look very queer, and my Company to &s;ink the <HI>Cole</HI> with abundance of Agility. My Mi&s;tre&s;s was in a Peck of Troubles, for the &s;ecurity of her Ponderous Pur&s;e; and
<PB N="12" REF="7">I thought by the Motion of her Pettycoats, &s;he was a going to put it where my Lady &mdash; did her Watch: Our Merchant &s;huffled Loo&s;e <HI>Yellow-Boys</HI> by dozens into the Lining of his Coat, and I Tru&s;ted to Providence: But at la&s;t, to our great Satis|faction, it prov'd to be a fal&s;e Alarm, and by the help of our <HI>Nanterian</HI> Cordial, we Recover'd our &s;tragling Sen&s;es: The Di&s;cour&s;e of which la&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> till we got to <HI>San|dy-Lane,</HI> where the Road was &s;o Damnable heavy, that two Mile in three hours was an Extraordinary Journey, and the Corporation-Trot to St. <HI>Pauls</HI> on <HI>Sunday,</HI> was a Fool to it: But at Ja&s;t we Arriv'd at the Sign of <HI>Chevalier Bruint,</HI> where we was to Dine.</P>
<P>Here we had &s;uch an <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> W&mdash; for our Landlady, that the like was never heard of. She hath Buried five Husbands, never had but one Son, and he was Hang'd; thirteen Daughters, and a Dozen of them was of their Mothers Stamp, and the other Dy'd an Infant; the Old one was a Widow, her Daughters Maids, yet between them had more Children, then <HI>Ro&s;emary-Lane</HI> a&s;&s;ords on a <HI>Sunday;</HI> and mo&s;t of their <HI>Sires</HI> was <HI>Souldiers</HI> or <HI>Cattle-Firkers.</HI> There was more Coaches and Waggons, drawn up before her Gate, then Hacks in <HI>Palace-Yard,</HI> during the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament,</HI> or <HI>Term-Time.</HI> All her Entertainment is Loins of <HI>Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Rabbets;</HI> and &s;he makes more Broth in a Day, then all the <HI>Chop-Hou&s;es</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;tle-Alley</HI> in a Week. At la&s;t, with much ado, we got two of the afore&s;aid Di&s;hes for Dinner, and a Na&s;ty Jade to Attend us; who, as we under&s;tood afterwards, was one of her Daughters; but by her Looks, one would Conjecture the Devil was her Father; yet &s;he was Recom|mended to us, for the Flower of them all: But in my Judgment the Old one is more inviting than any of her Off-Spring. The be&s;t Accommodation we had there, was the Juice of Pippins, which we Drank very Plentifully, but by it's Urinical motion, hindred <HI>Whip</HI> one Mile in four; and the Ladies Emi&s;&s;ary, Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Pert,</HI> once was &s;o hard put to it, that we thought by her Soure Looks, and the wringing of her Knees, &s;he had the <HI>Dry-Gripes;</HI> but at la&s;t a Natural Evacuation gave her Ea&s;e, and Crea|ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> great deal of Laughter. Our Bill was compos'd in a few Words; and was very Moderate, con&s;idering what Extravagant Prices, we often give for <HI>Mutton</HI> and <HI>Conny</HI> in &s;ome Places.</P>
<P>Having Din'd, we proceeded on our Journey, but with a great of di&s;&s;iculty; for the Road was &s;o Rocky, Unlevel, and Narrow in &s;ome Places, that! am per&s;wa|ded the <HI>Alps</HI> are to be pa&s;&s;ed with le&s;s danger, in the Performance of which, our firking <HI>E&s;&s;edarian</HI> was oblig'd to u&s;e abundance of Hor&s;e-Courting-Rhetorick to his Tired <HI>Ambulators;</HI> and when that prevail'd not, to Exerci&s;e his Tickler; but we were jolted &s;o Cur&s;edly, that I thought it would have made a di&s;location of my Bones; we all complain'd, but could find no Remedy; nor would I Advi&s;e any who have been Suf|ferers in <HI>Venus</HI> &s;ports, to Adventure the Fatigue of a Coach to the <HI>Bath,</HI> lea&s;t it di&s;|joynt a Member or two. At la&s;t when our Patience was almo&s;t worn out, we agreed to light rather than endure it any longer; but out Chariotier inform'd us, we were almo&s;t at our Journeys-end, which we pre&s;ently found to be true, and <HI>Bath</HI> was as Welcome to us, as a good Dinner to a <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Tooth-Picker.</P>
<P>Being come to the <HI>White-Hart,</HI> our long wi&s;h'd-for Port, we refre&s;hed our &s;elves with much Joy, after our tedious Mortifying-Journey: And there our Merchant took his Leave of us, in a fre&s;h Coach for <HI>Bri&s;htol:</HI> Then Enquiring for a Lodging, we were recommended to a <HI>Ton&s;ors,</HI> who&s;e Wife kept a <HI>Milliners-Shop</HI> in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, where was Accommodation for us all, tho' he had &s;everal other Lodgers in the Hou&s;e, of good Quality. That Night my Widow and I had an opportunity to enjoy our &s;elves to our Mutual Satisfaction, without any &s;u&s;picion, and agreed to be made one Fle&s;h, the fir&s;t opportunity that offer'd. In the Morning we were &s;aluted&punc; by the whole Fraternity of <HI>Cat-Gut-Scrapers,</HI> and cou'd not get rid of them without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Angel. My Mi&s;tre&s;s and her Si&s;ter would not appear Publick, till their Baggage Arriv'd from <HI>London,</HI> which they did not expect in three or four days, &s;o I had the Liberty &s;troul alone.</P>
<P>After I had Accouter'd my &s;elf to the be&s;t Advantage, (in which I made no &s;mall Figure) I went to the Coffee-Hou&s;e, where I found &s;everal of my Acquaintance, who &s;eem'd to be Over-joy'd at my Appearance, Imbrac'd and Slabber'd me, as an Old Woman does her Grand Child; asking a thou&s;and Impertinent Que&s;tions con|cerning <HI>London,</HI> and what Company came with me? If Ladies, or Gentlement? Whe|ther
<PB N="13" REF="7">my Quality was on the Road bound for the <HI>Bath?</HI> In which I &s;atisfied them to the be&s;t of my knowledge; but after we had taken a di&s;h or two, of that in&s;ipid Li|quor, we Adjourn'd to Hone&s;t <HI>C</HI>&mdash; at the <HI>Three T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> where we Enliven'd our Souls with a Gla&s;s of good <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> and &s;parkling <HI>Sherry;</HI> and from thence we went to &s;ee the Diver&s;ion of the <HI>Baths.</HI></P>
<P>Of which, 'tis not my De&s;ign to give you an Account of their <HI>Original,</HI> and Emi|nent <HI>Cures;</HI> or a De&s;cription of their <HI>Structure,</HI> and Noble <HI>Founders;</HI> for that's al|ready perform'd, in mo&s;t of our Chronicles; but &s;hall only hint on the <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Intrigues</HI> that are manag'd there during the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t we went to, is call'd the <HI>Kings;</HI> and to it joyns the <HI>Queen's,</HI> both run|ning in one; and the mo&s;t famous for Cures. In this <HI>Bath</HI> wee at lea&s;t Fifty of both Sexes, with a Score or two of Guides, who by their Scorbutick Carca&s;&s;es, and Lacker'd Hides, you would think they had lain Pickling a Century of Years in the <HI>Stygian Lake:</HI> Some had tho&s;e Infernal Emi&s;&s;aries to &s;upport their Impotent Limbs: Others to &s;crub their Putrify'd Carca&s;&s;es, like a Race-Flor&s;e. In one Corner was an Old Fornicator hanging by the Rings, Loaded with a Rotten Humidity: Hard by him was a Boxom Dame, Clean&s;ing her <HI>Nunquam Satis</HI> from <HI>Mercurial</HI> Dregs and the remains of <HI>Ro|man Vitriol.</HI> Another, half cover'd with Sear-Cloth, had more Sores than <HI>Lazarus,</HI> doing Pennance for the Sins of her Youth; At her Elbow was a Young Hero, &s;up|ported by a couple of Guides, rack'd with Aches and Intolerable Pains, Cur&s;ing of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Court, and <HI>Beveridges</HI> Dancing-School, as Heartily as <HI>Job</HI> the Day of his Birth. At the Pump was &s;everal a Drenching their Gullets, and Gormandizing the Reaking Liquor by Whole&s;ale.</P>
<P>From thence we went to the <HI>Cro&s;s-Bath,</HI> where mo&s;t of the Quality re&s;orts, more Fam'd for Plea&s;ure then Cures, tho' they pretend it hath wrought Miracles on Bar|ren-Soil, and wonderfully helps Conception. Not long &s;ince, a Gentleman of Qua|lity was beholden to it for an Heir, as he reported; but his Lady is of a contrary Opinion; yet I know not what Operation &s;uch Tempting Objects may have by cau&s;ing Titilation, and heighten Imagination, to procure an immediate Conjunction. Here is perform'd all the Wanton Dalliancies imaginable; Celebrated Beauties, Panting Brea&s;ts, and Curious Shapes, almo&s;t Expos'd to Publick View; Langui&s;hing Eyes, Darting Killing Glances, Tempting Amorous Po&s;tures, attended by &s;oft Mu|&s;ick, enough to provoke a <HI>Ve&s;tal</HI> to forbidden Plea&s;ure, Captivate a <HI>Saint,</HI> and Charm a <HI>Jove:</HI> Here was al&s;o different Sexes, from Quality to the Honourable <HI>Knights,</HI> Coun|try <HI>Put,</HI> and City <HI>Madam</HI>'s: Nay, the Circumciz'd <HI>Jew,</HI> could <HI>Bathe</HI> in Delight, <HI>Swim</HI> in Plea&s;ure with the <HI>Gentile,</HI> &amp; out-vie a Courtier in Splendor, tho' they Crucifi'd his God; and Di&s;pence with <HI>Chri&s;tians-Fla&s;h,</HI> tho' not with <HI>Swines.</HI> The Ladies with their floating <HI>Jappan</HI>-Bowles, freighted with Confectionary Knick-Knacks, E&s;lences, &amp; Per|fumes, Wade about, like <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Courtiers, &s;uppling their Indu&s;trious Joynts. The Vigorous Sperks, pre&s;enting them with &s;everal Antick Po&s;tures, as Sailing on their Backs, then Embracing the Element, &s;ink in a Rapture, and by Accidental De&s;ign, thru&s;t a &s;tretch'd Arm; but where the Water conceal'd, &s;o ought my Pen.</P>
<P>The Spectators in the Galleries, plea&s;ing their Roving Fancies with this Ladies Face, anothers Eyes, a thirds heaving Brea&s;ts, and Profound Air. In one Corner &s;tood an Old Letcher, who&s;e years &s;poke him no le&s;s then three&s;core and ten, ma|king Love to a Young Lady, not exceeding fourteen. The u&s;ual time being come to for&s;ake that &s;ickle Element, <HI>Half-Tub Chairs,</HI> Lin'd with Blankets, Ply'd as thick, as <HI>Coaches</HI> at the <HI>Play-Hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Carts</HI> at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Bathing being over for that Day, we went to walk in the Grove, a very plea&s;ant Place for Diver&s;ion; there is the <HI>Royal-Oak</HI> and &s;everal Raffling Shops: In one of the Walks, is &s;everal Sets of Nine-Pins, and Attendance to wait on you: Tipping all Nine for a Guinea, is as common there, as two Farthings for a <HI>Porringer</HI> of <HI>Bar|ley-Broth,</HI> at the <HI>Ho&s;pital-Gate</HI> in <HI>Smithfield.</HI> On &s;everal of the Trees was hung a Lampoon on the Marriage of one Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash; a Drugmonger, and the famous Madam <HI>S</HI>&mdash; an old <HI>B</HI>&mdash; of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Having almo&s;t tir'd our &s;elves with walking, we took to a Bench to ea&s;e our wea|ry Pede&s;tals. Now, &s;aid my Friend, I'll give you an impartial Account of the Per|fections, Qualities and Functions, of a few particular Per&s;ons that are among
<PB N="14" REF="8">this Amphibious Crowd. For notwith&s;tanding I have been here not above a Fort|night, I am as well acquainted with the Town and its Intrigues, as old Ju&s;tice <HI>P</HI>&mdash; with <HI>More-fields</HI> and <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Bawdy-Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e two Ladies with the Gentleman in Blew, are Si&s;ters, live near the Church that is Dedicated to a Saint who expir'd on a Gridiron, they are Amorous Dames; the Gentleman is a Broken Officer, and lives better on their Allowances, than he could on his Pay. This gentlewoman in the White-Damesk Cown, is a Sea-Cap|tains Lady; who, while her Corniferous Mate is Plowing the Ocean, takes Care to Manure his <HI>Pa&s;ture,</HI> that he may have a Fruitful Crop this Harve&s;t. That Foppi&s;h <HI>Beau</HI> in Scarlet Stockings, who&s;e Hilt of his Sword bears a bob with his Calves, and his Jubilee Hatband lies &s;titch'd cro&s;s the Crown, was a Pettycoat-Pen&s;ioner to Ma|dam <HI>C</HI>&mdash;near <HI>Bucklersbury;</HI> but being lately Di&s;carded, is come down here for pro|motion. That young Lady with the Gold Orice Pettycoat, was a great Fortune, and not long &s;ince was Married to a Flannel Wa&s;tecoat, and a double Night-Cap of the &s;ame Stuff; but now by rea&s;on of her Husbands Imbecility, is forc'd to have re|cour&s;e to the <HI>Bath.</HI> That Tall Gentleman attended by three Liveries, is &s;omething of Quality, a right Courtier, for he abhors the Cirizens Wives as much as the Sword-Bearer does <HI>Cu&s;tard.</HI> That <HI>Broad-price</HI> Doctor, in the Diminutive Band, makes a Pur|cha&s;e every year by the Wickedne&s;s of the Age; and Vindicates <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>ing</HI> more than ever <HI>G.K</HI>&mdash;Writ again&s;t the Quakers. That Pert young Gentlewoman with the two Silver Fringes, was compell'd by her Friends to Marry a Slovenly <HI>Stechjobber,</HI> and now is &s;urfeited with his Embraces; and came to the <HI>Bath</HI> to mend his Breed. That Crafty Prie&s;t, that Son of <HI>Levi,</HI> is as fickle as a Weather-Cock, and would &s;ooner di&s;card a good Con&s;cience, then a fat Benefice. This Tun of Iniquity, in the Crim|&s;on Gown, with <HI>Mon&s;icur</HI> at her Elbow, two <HI>Dewils</HI> behind her, and <HI>Aetna</HI> in her Face, all the Water in the <HI>Severn</HI> is not able to Quench her de&s;ires; &s;he is a &s;econd <HI>Ma&s;&s;e|lina,</HI> will tire, but ne'er be &s;atisfi'd; &s;he hath already quarter'd a Troop of <HI>French</HI> Dragoons, a Regiment of <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> and now is come to Exerci&s;e a Battalion of <HI>Brittains.</HI> That Powder'd <HI>Lab&s;ter</HI> in the Edg'd Hat, is the Spawn of a <HI>Broker;</HI> from thence Evapulated to a <HI>Bully,</HI> now &s;hams an <HI>Officer,</HI> &s;ets up for a <HI>Stallion</HI> of the fir&s;t Rank, and pretends he receives &s;everal Favours from a Qualitificated Lady. That Spark with his Hat under his Arm, is a Limb of the Law, but hath Studied <HI>Cham|berlins</HI> Midwifry, more than <HI>Cook</HI>'s Reports. That <HI>Dowdy Minx</HI> in the Scarlet Top|ping, and Pink'd Scarff, is the Relick of a broken <HI>Grocer;</HI> an Indu&s;trious Woman, for her Head's no &s;ooner lay'd, but her Breech is at Work. In &s;hort, for <HI>Fops, Beaus,</HI> and <HI>Bellfa's,</HI> this Place exceeds <HI>Greys-Inn-Walks</HI> on <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening; and con&s;i&s;ts of greater variety of Per&s;ons, Remarkable for &s;ome Vice or Folly, than there are Ingredients in a Lombard-Pye for a City Fea&s;t; to give you a particular De&s;cription of each of 'em, will require a Weeks time at lea&s;t. Come therefore, let's go to &s;ome Tipling Man&s;ion, and Carou&s;e, till we have Exbilerated our Drowthy Souls: To which I readily agreed. About five in the Evening, we went to a &s;ee a great <HI>Match</HI> at Bowling; there was <HI>Quality,</HI> and Reverend <HI>Doctors</HI> of both Profe&s;&s;ions, Topping <HI>Merchants,</HI> Broken <HI>Bankers,</HI> Noted <HI>Mercers,</HI> Inns-of Court <HI>Rales,</HI> City <HI>Beaus,</HI> Stray'd <HI>Prentices,</HI> and <HI>Dancing-Ma&s;ters</HI> in abundance. <HI>Fly, fly, fly, fly;</HI> &s;aid one: <HI>Rub, rub, rub, rub,</HI> cry'd another. <HI>Ten Guinies to five, I &V;ncover the</HI> Jack, &s;ays a third, <HI>Danon the&s;e Nice Fingers of mine,</HI> cry'd my Lord, <HI>I Slipt my Bowl, and mi&s;took the Bias.</HI> Ano|ther Swearing he knew the Ground to an Inch, and would hold five Pound his Bowl came in. But in &s;hort, the Citizens won the Courtiers Money, and the Courtiers Swore to be Reveng'd on their Wives, and Daughters.</P>
<P>From hence we went to the <HI>Groom-Porters,</HI> where they were a Labouring like &s;o many <HI>Ancher-Smiths,</HI> at the <HI>Oake, Bach Gammon, Tick-Tack, Iri&s;h, Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> and throwing of <HI>Mains.</HI> There was Palming, Lodging, Loaded Dice, Levant, and Gammoning, with all the Speed imaginable; but the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Rook was too hard for them all. The <HI>Bri&s;tol Fair</HI> Sparks had but a very had Bargain of it; and little occa&s;ion for Returns. <HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer-Notes,</HI> were as Plenty, as <HI>Fops</HI> at the <HI>Chocolat-Hou&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Pater-no&s;ter-Row.</HI> Having &s;atisfied our Curio&s;ity here; we le&s;t them as bu&s;ie a &s;haking their Elbows, as the <HI>Apple-woman</HI> in <HI>Stocks-Market,</HI> Wallnuts in <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>And meeting with three or four more Acquaintance, we Stroul'd to a <HI>Bri&s;tol-Milk
<PB N="15" REF="8">Dary-Hou&s;e,</HI> and Enjoy'd our&s;elves like brave <HI>Bacchanalians.</HI> At Night I &s;tole into my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Arms, as Vigorous, as Youth, Beauty, Wine and Love, could in&s;pire me; but &s;he urging mightily for a &s;peedy Marriage, which I was not very back|ward to, we agreed to be Riveted the next Morning; &s;he undertaking to ingage the Maid to A&s;&s;i&s;t her, and I, our Landlord, to procure a Mini&s;ter; which accordingly was perform'd the next day, with a great deal of Secre&s;ie, at the Expence of half a &s;core Guineas; and Spou&s;e de&s;ir'd it might not be known while we continu'd in the Country, for &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons. Now being joyn'd by the Prie&s;t, Ma|dam <HI>Bride,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Pert,</HI> managed it &s;o, that we lay together without any Mi&s;tru&s;t. <HI>Let a Woman alone for a Contrivance, to obtain her De&s;ires.</HI></P>
<P>About Ten in the Morning, I was &s;ent for by &s;ome Acquaintance, to the general Rendezvouz&mdash;<HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> where Fools, Cullies, Squires, Beaus, &amp; Criticks, re&s;ort as thick, as <HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI> about the Effigies on the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> here Witici&s;m was Abdicated, and Non&s;ence banded to and fro, like a Shuttle-Cock. The la&s;t Nights Intrigue Whi&s;per'd with abundance of Caution, and that Nights Ball was Progno&s;ticated would be very Noble, for 'twas given by a Lady of Quality, and after an hour or two of their in&s;ipid Fu&s;tian and Block-headly Combate, we went to Raffle for a Pre&s;ent for our Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and with the lo&s;s of a Guinea, I brought off a curious Snu&s;h-Box, worth four: But tho' I was Fortunes Favorite, &s;he Bilk'd a young Mercer of twenty <HI>Jacobu&s;&s;es,</HI> and at the <HI>Oake</HI> the &s;ame Night double the Number, and a Bay Gelding.</P>
<P>From thence we went to the <HI>Hot-Bath,</HI> and <HI>Leapers-Bath,</HI> but there was nothing worth our Ob&s;ervation, but a parcel of old Crutches, hung up in Memory of the Per&s;ons that receiv'd tho&s;e Miraculous Cures. The next place we adjourn'd to, was to <HI>Herrid Tones;</HI> where we had good Wine, and better Company; and being my Wedding-Day, I went home to Dine with my Bride, and in the Evening pre|vail'd with her to go to the Ball.</P>
<P>Which is always kept at the Town-Hall, a very &s;pacious Room, and fitted up for that Purpo&s;e. During which, the Door is kept by a couple of Brawny Beadles, to keep out the Mobility, looking as fierce as the Uncouth Figures at <HI>Guild-Hall;</HI> there was Extraordinary Fine Dancing, (and how cou'd it otherwi&s;e chu&s;e?) for Spou&s;e and I had a Hand in it. A Con&s;ort of Delicate Mu&s;ick, Vocal and In&s;trumental, per|form'd by good Ma&s;ters: A Noble Collation of dry Sweet-Meats, Rich Wine, and Large Attendance. The Lady who was the <HI>Doner,</HI> wore an Extraordinary Rich Favour, to di&s;tingui&s;h her from the re&s;t, which is always the Cu&s;tome; and before they break up, to chu&s;e another for the next Day, which fell upon a Shentleman of <HI>Wales;</HI> but nor no ways Derogated from her Honour, or Di&s;perag'd her Coun|trey in the lea&s;t, but hur was as Noble, and as Generous, as e'er an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shentle|man of them all: To hur Honour be it Spoke.</P>
<P>The next Day the Ladies Baggage Arriv'd from <HI>London;</HI> then they made as top|ping a Figure as any of them are, and the fir&s;t Night after their Publick Appear|ance, we were &s;o troubl'd with &s;ome Serenading Coxcombs, that the whole Family got up, and had not Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> been vigilant, my new Adopted Fle&s;h and I, had been catch'd abed together; for which good Service, I rewarded her with a broad piece of her own Name. A <HI>Sunday</HI> we went to Church to the Abby, a very Ancient Ca|thedral piece of Antiquity, and kept as badly in repair; 'tis Crowded during Divine Service, as much as St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> in which time there is more Billet Deaux convey'd to the Ladies, than Notes to de&s;ire the Prayers of the Congregation at <HI>B</HI>'s&mdash;Meeting-Hou&s;e: And as the Ingenious Doctor in his Di&s;cour&s;e, told the Audience, <HI>He was afraid mo&s;t of them came more out of Cu&s;tome and Formality, than in Devotion to the Sa|cred Deity, or a &s;uitable Reverence to the Place of Wor&s;hip.</HI> Which was very True, I am Confident, and the Ladies were the only Saints &s;everal came there to Adore; as this Billet Deaux will confirm; it was convey'd in a Candid Orange to a Lady in one of the Galleries, which &s;he by Accident dropt, and I had the Fortune to find.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Had Fortune that Fickle Godde&s;s, but Honour'd me with your Acquaintance, as &s;he has by &s;eeing of your Per&s;on, I &s;hould not have been &s;o Pre&s;umptuous, as to have offer'd the&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="9">imperfect Lines to your fair Hands; but &s;ince my Cruel Stars ordain'd me no &s;uch happi|ne&s;s, I was forc'd to make my Pen become my Orator, and Commit that to Writing which ought rather to have been Pay'd by Adoration. At &s;ix this Evening I &s;hall be in the Meadows; Pity your Slave, and Grant me &s;ome Relief.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the Evening we took a Walk into the Meadows, much re&s;orted to for plea|&s;ant Rivers, and delicate Walks; 'tis a &s;econd <HI>Hide-Park</HI> for Coaches, and a St. <HI>James</HI>'s for <HI>Beau</HI>'s and <HI>Belfa</HI>'s of all &s;orts; there was <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Semp&s;tre&s;s, my Lord <HI>R</HI>&mdash; Mantua-Makers dandled by Cringing Fops, Antick Beaus, and Blu&s;tering Bullies Innumerable, <HI>London-Jilts</HI> with Tails like Counte&s;&s;es, and ca&s;e-harden'd Im|pudence; bantering Young Squires, and Shopkeepers Prentices: Nay my Millenian Landlady, and her Si&s;ter, was there Intriguing, and as well match'd as a pair of Nice Coach-Hor&s;es; much Admired, the one for an obliging Temper, the other for a Beauty; but ask hone&s;t <HI>Punch</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;try-Cook,</HI> he'll tell you they Rival each other in their own proper Qalifications.</P>
<P>After an Hour or two's Walking, I Treated my Ladies with the be&s;t the Place afforded, and then returned Home: But the next Morning I receiv'd a Letter of Advice from <HI>London,</HI> of the Death of an Aunt, who had made me her Heir; which put me in mind of the Old Proverb, <HI>It never Rains, but mu&s;t Pour.</HI> However this was no ill News to my Bride, nor me neither; only requiring my &s;peedy appear|ance at <HI>London;</HI> but I promi&s;ed Spou&s;e, and the re&s;t of my Acquaintance, to be with them again in a Fortnights time, and tho' an Heir, took Leave of them with as much Regret, as the <HI>Dutch-Guards</HI> of <HI>Ken&s;ington;</HI> and the next Morning took Po&s;t for <HI>London.</HI> Having now given you an Account of my &s;ucce&s;sful Step, I'll make bold, and give you my Sentiments of the <HI>BATH.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>A Character of the <HI>BATH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS neither Town nor City, yet goes by the Name of both; five Months in the Year 'tis as Populous as <HI>London,</HI> the other &s;even as de&s;olate as a Wilderne&s;s. It's chiefe&s;t Inhabitants are Turn-&s;pit-Dogs; and it looks like <HI>Lombard-Street</HI> on a Saints-day. During the Sea&s;on, it hath as many Families in a Hou&s;e as <HI>Edenborough;</HI> and Bills are as thick for Lodgings to be Let, as there was for Hou&s;es in the <HI>Pry|ars</HI> on the Late Act of Parliament for the Di&s;&s;olution of Priviledges; but when the <HI>Baths</HI> are u&s;ele&s;s, &s;o are their Hou&s;es, and as empty as the new Buildings by St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the Fields: The <HI>Baths</HI> I can compare to nothing but the <HI>Boylers</HI> in <HI>Fleet-lane</HI> or <HI>Old-Bedlam,</HI> for they have a reaking &s;teem all the year. In a word, 'tis a Valley of Plea&s;ure, yet a &s;ink of Iniquity; nor is there any Intrigues or Debauch Acted at <HI>London,</HI> but is Mimick'd there.</P>
