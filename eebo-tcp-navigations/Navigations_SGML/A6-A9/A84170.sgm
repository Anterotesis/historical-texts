<HEAD>The State of FRANCE, as it &s;tood in the Ninth yeer of this pre&s;ent Monarch <HI>LEWIS the XIIII,</HI> Written to a Friend.</HEAD>
<P>_SInce I had fir&s;t the honour to bee one of tho&s;e who&s;e Conver&s;ation you have che|ri&s;hed with &s;o many &s;ignall obligations, and, as it were, currents of civility; I can hard|ly
<PB REF="3">think, that (when by &s;o ma|ny literal expre&s;&s;es and per&s;o|nal commands, you enjoin me to deliver &s;omething in <HI>writing,</HI> touching the late &s;ubject of our di&s;cour&s;e) you have either cau&s;e to delight in my triviall con|ceptions, or de&s;igne my di&s;cre|dit: For however your in&s;tan|ces have at la&s;t prevailed, yet your Honor is no le&s;&s;e concer|ned to be tender how you publi&s;h my defects, while&s;t in them onely (though the faults be mine) men will &s;o perem|ptorily conclude your want of judgment, and condemn your Election. But you have pro|mi&s;ed to be di&s;creet, and I &s;hall then make a &s;aving adventure
<PB REF="3">of my Reputation with you, who have candor and charity not from the <HI>Multitude,</HI> but the &s;tock of your own <HI>worth</HI> and ingenuous Education; of which this <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> will be rather an Hi&s;tory, then any thing o|therwi&s;e capable to informe you, who know already &s;o much more, and better, then I can po&s;&s;ibly either write or relate.</P>
<P>But to begin once, &s;ince it is my fate to obey you; I &s;hall nothing alter the <HI>Scene,</HI> which was then Pre&s;ented you, when you were plea&s;ed (as it &s;ince appears) to take notice of tho&s;e ca&s;uall Di&s;cour&s;es of mine, wherein I po&s;ted over the
<PB REF="4">be&s;t Remarks, and mo&s;t mate|riall Ob&s;ervations which my weak Judgment had been able to recollect, during my &s;o ma|ny <HI>Pererrations,</HI> and unprofi|table <HI>Sojourn</HI> abroad, and e&s;pe|cially in this Kingdome of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Nor wil I vex your patience with any <HI>Topographicall</HI> De&s;cri|ptions, as being the daily &s;ub|ject of your Contemplations, when at any time you plea&s;e to refre&s;h your &s;elf among&s;t tho&s;e exqui&s;ite <HI>Cards</HI> of the late&s;t and mo&s;t accurate <HI>Editi|ons:</HI> But repre&s;ent, in as &s;uc|cinct a Method as I am able, what in order to Affairs (as in the Government of this mo&s;t
<PB REF="4">active and Illu&s;trious Monar|chie they now &s;tand) I conceive to be chiefly proper and requi|&s;ite for a Gentleman of our Nation (under the notion of a <HI>Traveller</HI>) to be able to render an accompt of at his Return: And therefore, before I proceed further, I will complie with your de&s;ire, and &s;peak a word or two (by way of Introducti|on, or Digre&s;&s;ion rather) of my <HI>&s;entiment</HI> and opinion tou|ching <HI>Forraign Travel</HI> in Gene|ral, wherein I &s;hall al&s;o deal very impartially with all the world concerning mine own particular, as being (I hope) taking my long farewel there|of.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>That which fir&s;t rendred me of this <HI>Apodemick</HI> humour, (I &s;hall not di&s;cour&s;e here of <HI>Mercuriall</HI> complexions, whom <HI>Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts</HI> affirm to be <HI>Indi|vidua vaga's,</HI> like my &s;elf) pro|ceeded from a certain vaine Emulation which I had to &s;ee the be&s;t of Education, which every body &s;o decrying at Home, made me conceive, was a commodity onely to be brought from a far Countrie; and I cannot &s;ay, without a little ambition too of <HI>knowing,</HI> or at lea&s;t of having the pri|viledg to <HI>talk</HI> &s;omething more then others could rea&s;onably pretend to, that had never bin out of &s;ight of their owne
<PB REF="5">chimnies &s;moke: All which was a Ridiculous affectation, contracted fir&s;t from the ordi|nary <HI>Radomontadas</HI> of &s;uch as have &s;een &s;trange places, and great want of di&s;cretion, and &s;o fondly tran&s;ported with the plea&s;ure onely, and temptation of <HI>Novelties,</HI> the very in&s;tru|mental cau&s;es of this un&s;etled extravagancy.</P>
<P>True it is, <HI>Non omnis fert om|nia Tellus:</HI> for the great and good God hath di&s;creetly, and very wi&s;ely di&s;po&s;ed, in the furni&s;hing and adorning (as I may &s;ay) of this <HI>Terre&s;trial Ca|binet,</HI> having left no one part or corner thereof without &s;ome thing &s;pecially different,

<P>Now then, for as much as the end of all our <HI>Appetites,</HI> wi&s;ely <HI>inquired</HI> into, ought to be the principal <HI>Mira,</HI> and terme to all our actions, he that would travell rationally, and

<PB REF="7">wares of more value, then if they had tran&s;ported Gold and Pearles.

<P>To proeeed therfore, pre&s;up|po&s;e Travell <HI>ut &s;u&s;cipiatur propter unum aliquem finem,</HI> as we have already con&s;tituted it: we are yet to give our young &s;ubject leave to be &s;o far <HI>practical,</HI> as that he do not &s;lip any opportunity by which he may inform him|&s;elf as well in things even <HI>Me|chanically</HI> curious and u&s;efull, as altogether in the My&s;teries of Government and <HI>Polity,</HI>
<PB REF="10">which indeed are more <HI>appo|&s;itely</HI> termed <HI>Philo&s;ophicall.</HI> Tho&s;e who have impo&s;ed on them&s;elves, and others, &s;o ma|ny different &s;pecies of <HI>travell,</HI> as it may be &s;aid to contein <HI>Theoreticall</HI> parts in it, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Metaphy&s;icall, Phy&s;icall,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicall,</HI> are, in my ap|prehen&s;ion, more exact and tedious in their <HI>Analy&s;ing,</HI> then perhaps they needed to have been; of them therefore I &s;ay no more: it &s;hall be &s;ufficient for him whom I &s;end abroad, that he conform him&s;elf to &s;uch precepts as are onely <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> not cumber&s;ome; which Rule he &s;hall likewi&s;e do well to ob&s;erve even in his

<P>Fir&s;t then, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> apt for all <HI>Impre&s;sions,</HI> but from his <HI>primary education</HI> inclined to the mo&s;t worthy: having &s;et his Foot upon the <HI>Continent,</HI> his fir&s;t &s;tudy &s;hall be to ma&s;ter the <HI>tongue</HI> of the Country wherein hee re&s;olves to Re|&s;ide; which ought to be un|der&s;tood perfectly, written congruou&s;ly, and &s;poken intel|ligently: after which he may do well to accompli&s;h him|&s;elf in &s;uch <HI>exerci&s;es,</HI> as are mo&s;t commendable at home, and be&s;t attayned abroad; which will be a means of rendring

<PB REF="13">conver&s;ations; nor for mine own part, do I e&s;teem it in all ca&s;es nece&s;&s;ary, provided a man be furni&s;hed with &s;uch a &s;tock of prudence, as he know how, and when to make u&s;e even of his companions ex|travagancies, (as then frequent|ly betraying more freely their inclinations, then at times of their more &s;erious recolle|ction, and fir&s;t addre&s;&s;es.) Seeing I find it generally im|po&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Traveller</HI> to evade &s;ome occa&s;ions &amp; encounters, which (if he be at all practi|cal) he will <HI>nolens volens,</HI> per|ceive him&s;elf ingaged into at &s;ome one time or other. But
<PB REF="13">to recover this deviation, and return to our purpo&s;e; the vertues which our Traveller is to bring home when he doth <HI>Repatriare</HI> (as <HI>Solinus</HI> terms it) are either publick, &s;uch name|ly as concern the &s;ervice of his Country; or Private, and altogether per&s;onall, in order to his particular advantage and &s;atisfaction: and, be|leeve it <HI>Sir,</HI> if he reap &s;ome contentment extraordinary, from what he hath ob&s;erved abroad, The pains, &s;ollici|tations, watchings, Perills, journeys, ill enterteinment, ab&s;ence from Friends, and innumerable like inconveni|ences,
<PB REF="14">joyned to his va&s;t expen|ces, do very dearly, and by a &s;trange kind of extortion, pur|cha&s;e that &s;mal experience and reputation which he can vaunt to have acquired from abroad.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who boa&s;t of <HI>Philolo|gicall</HI> Peregrinations (fal&s;ly &s;o called) which they undertake meerly for the flouri&s;h and Tongue of a Place, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e onely a Paret-vertue; It is one of the <HI>Shels</HI> of Travel (though I confe&s;&s;e, the kernel is not to be procured without it: And <HI>Topical;</HI> in which I finde the <HI>Dutch</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, generally mo&s;t accurate and indu&s;trious; both of them &s;erve well for the en|tertainment
<PB REF="14">of Women and Children, who are common|ly more imported with won|der and <HI>Romance,</HI> then that &s;olid and reall Emolument, which is (through the&s;e <HI>In|&s;truments</HI>) to be conveyed us from abroad.</P>
<P>It is written of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> that hee &s;aw many Cities indeed, but withall his Remarks of mens Manners and Cu&s;toms, was ever preferred to his coun|ting Steeples, and making <HI>Tours:</HI> It is this <HI>Ethicall</HI> and <HI>Morall</HI> part of Travel, which embelli&s;heth a Gentleman, in the fir&s;t place, having a due re&s;pect to the <HI>Religion,</HI> which
<PB REF="15">accompli&s;heth a Chri&s;tian: In &s;hort, they are all &s;everally very commendable, accom|modated to <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Pro|fe&s;sions;</HI> nor &s;hould a <HI>Ca|valier</HI> neglect to be &s;een in all of them: But for that my in|tention is here to make an Introduction onely into mine own OBSERVATIONS, I &s;hall forbear to enter &s;o large and ample a Field, as the through handling of this Argument would in&s;en&s;ibly oblige mee to do, it having likewi&s;e been &s;o abundantly treated of al|mo&s;t by every Pen which hath prevaricated on this <HI>Subject;</HI> though, in my &s;lender judg|ment,

<P>To conclude (Sir) and con|tract this tedious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, I conjure you to beleeve, that I offer nothing to you in this di&s;cour&s;e, out of any the lea&s;t &s;elf opinion, cen&s;ure of other men, vanity, or o&s;tentation. No, I am a&s;&s;ured you will find me far enough from that <HI>IdiopathiaE,</HI> and common di|&s;temper of <HI>Travellers;</HI> all I &s;hall pretend being but to commu|nicate unto you, how I have lo&s;t part of tho&s;e &s;even yeares, and more; which, not be|ing
<PB REF="16">(as in truth they ought to have been) wholly exerci|&s;ed in the Benefit I might have reaped from your &s;o|ciety at home, I am obliged in Honour, and for Ju&s;tifi|cation of my &s;elf, to render you an Accompt how they have been di&s;pen&s;ed abroad.
