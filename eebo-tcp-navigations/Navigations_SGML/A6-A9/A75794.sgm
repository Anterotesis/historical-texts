<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding Encouragement for a new Edition of the <HI>Ladies Travels,</HI> as I had ju&s;t Rea&s;on from your Merits before, to dedicate a part of them to you, &s;o the Continuation of your particular Favours makes me take this Opportunity to acknowledge them, and now to Addre&s;s the Whole. I found the former Editions to have good Suc|ce&s;s under your Name; &s;o that both Profit and Gratitude oblige me again to beg you to take this Work of the Fair Sex into your further Protection and Patronage. Your Great Skill in that Excellent Art, which with &s;o much Life and Plea&s;ure repre&s;ents the La|dies, be&s;ides your other extraordinary
<PB REF="3"> Qualifications, endears you to them, and I hope will influence them to help me off with this Impre&s;&s;ion. They will certainly for the Honour of their Sex, contribute to let this Incompara|ble Lady's Productions have a more exten&s;ive Spread and Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, and give me leave to conclude with my humble Thanks for all your Civilities and Kindne&s;&s;es, and my hearty Wi&s;hes for your Pro|&s;perity. I am,</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF A Voyage to <HI>SPAIN,</HI> IN <HI>Several Letters.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER. I.</HEAD>
<P>SEEING you are &s;o earne&s;t with me to let you know all my Adventures and what&s;oever I have ob&s;erv'd du|ring my Travels, you mu&s;t therefore be contented (my dear Cou&s;in) to bear with a great many trifling Occur|rences, before you can meet with what will plea&s;e you: I know your fancy is &s;o nice and delicate, that none but ex|traordinary Accidents can entertain you; and I wi&s;h I had no others to relate: but recounting things faithfully, as they have hapned, you mu&s;t be contented therewith.</P>
<P>I gave you an Account in my la&s;t, of what I met with as far as <HI>Bayonne:</HI> you know this is a Town in <HI>France,</HI> Fron|tier to <HI>Spain,</HI> wa&s;h'd by the Rivers <HI>Dadour</HI> and <HI>Nivelle,</HI> which joyn together; and the Sea comes up to them. The Port and Trade are con&s;iderable: I came from <HI>Axe</HI> by Water, and ob&s;erv'd that the Boat-men of <HI>Adour</HI> have the &s;ame Cu&s;tom as tho&s;e of <HI>Caronne;</HI> which is to &s;ay, That in pa&s;&s;ing by one another, they &s;et up a Hollowing; and they had rather lo&s;e their Wages than to forbear the&s;e &s;ort of Shoutings, although exceeding vexatious to tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to them. There
<PB N="2" REF="4"> are two Ca&s;tles &s;trong enough to defend the Town, and there are about it &s;everal plea&s;ant Walks.</P>
<P>At my Arrival there, I intreated the Baron <HI>de Castlenau,</HI> who had accompany'd me from <HI>Axe,</HI> to bring me acquainted with &s;ome Women, with whom I might &s;pend my time with le&s;s impatience, till the Litters came, which were to be &s;ent to me from St. <HI>Sebastian.</HI></P>
<P>He readily complied with my Reque&s;t: for being a Per&s;on of Quality and Worth, he is much e&s;teem'd at <HI>Bayonne.</HI> He fail'd not the next Morning to bring &s;everal Ladies to vi&s;it me.</P>
<P>The&s;e Women begin here to feel the &s;corching Heats of the Sun; their Complexion is dark, their Eyes &s;parkling; they are charming enough, their Wits are &s;harp: And I could give you a farther Account of their Capacities, could I have better under&s;tood what they &s;aid: not but that they could all &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> yet with &s;uch a different Dialect, as &s;urpa&s;t my Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Some who came to &s;ee me, brought little &s;ucking Pigs un|der their Arms, as we do little Dogs: it's true they were very &s;pruce, and &s;everal of 'em had Collars of Ribbons, of various Colours: However, this Cu&s;tom looks very odd, and I cannot but think that &s;everal among them&s;elves are di&s;gu&s;ted at it: When they danced, they mu&s;t &s;et them down, and let the&s;e grunting Animals run about the Chamber, where they make a very plea&s;ant Harmony. The&s;e Ladies danc'd at my Intreaty, the Baron of <HI>Castleneau</HI> having &s;ent for Pipes and Tabors.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who attended the Ladies, took each of 'em her whom he had brought with him, and the Dance began in a Round, all holding Hands: they had afterwards long Canes brought them, and then each Spark taking hold of the Lady's Handkerchief, which &s;eparated them from one another, moved very gracefully at the Sound of this Martial &s;ort of Mu&s;ick, which in&s;pired them with &s;uch Heat, that they &s;eem'd not to be able to moderate it. This &s;eem'd to me to re&s;emble the <HI>Pyrric</HI> Dance &s;o much celebrated by the Ancients; for the&s;e Gentle|men and Ladies made &s;o many Turns, Frisks and Capers, their Canes being thrown up into the Air, and dexterou&s;ly caught again, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe their Art and Agility: And I had a great deal of Plea&s;ure in &s;eeing 'em; but methoughts it la&s;ted too long, and I began to grow weary of this ill-ordered Ball&punc; When the Baron <HI>de Ca&s;tleneau,</HI> who perceiv'd it, cau&s;ed &s;e|veral Baskets of dried Fruit to be brought in. They are the <HI>Jews</HI> who pa&s;t for <HI>Portugui&s;es,</HI> and dwell at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> who tran&s;port them from <HI>Geroa,</HI> and furni&s;h all the Country with them. We
<PB N="3" REF="4"> wanted not for <HI>Limonade,</HI> and other refre&s;hing Waters, of which the&s;e Ladies drank heartily; and &s;o the Entertainment ended.</P>
<P>I was carry'd the next Morning to &s;ee the Synagogue of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the Suburb of the Holy Spirit, but met with nothing remarkable there. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Pe,</HI> the Kings Lieutenant, who came to &s;ee me, though much troubled with the Gout, invited me to Dine at his Hou&s;e, where I was mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly entertain'd; for this is a Country abounding with good Cheer, and at cheap Rates. I found here Women of Quality, that were very hand&s;ome, whom he had invited to bear me Compa|ny. The &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle, which faces the River, is very plea&s;ant, and has always a good Garri&s;on in it.</P>
<P>At my return to my Lodging, I was &s;urpriz'd to find &s;everal Pieces of Linnen, which were brought to me from the Ladies who came to &s;ee me, with Baskets full of dried Sweet-meats. This Treatment &s;eem'd to me very obliging, to a Lady whom they had not known above four or five Days. But I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, there is not any finer Linnen in the World than that which is made in this Country, &s;ome of which is open like Net-work, and the Threads of it finer than Hair: And I remember, that travelling thro' the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> which may be rather call'd De&s;arts, the poor Pea&s;ants living &s;o wretchedly; yet I found among them as neat Napkins as tho&s;e u&s;ed among&s;t People of Quality at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I fail'd not to &s;end the&s;e Ladies &s;uch little Pre&s;ents which I thought might plea&s;e them: I perceiv'd they were great Ad|mirers of Ribbons, and wear a great many on their Heads and Ears, which made me &s;end them a great many; to which I ad|ded &s;everal Fans: and they, by way of Return, pre&s;ented me with Gloves, and Thread-Stockins, mo&s;t delicately knit.</P>
<P>In &s;ending them to me, they de&s;ired me to go to the next Chappel, which was not far from my Quarters, where they in|tended to Regale me with the be&s;t Mu&s;ick the Town would af|ford but though there were very good Voices, yet there is no great plea&s;ure in hearing them, becau&s;e they want both Air and Skill.</P>
<P>The Litters which I expected from <HI>Spain,</HI> being come, I prepared for my Departure; but I never met any thing dearer than the&s;e &s;ort of Equipages; for each Litter has a Ma&s;ter that accompanies it, who keeps the Gravity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, being mounted on a Mule, and his Man on another, with which they relea&s;e ever and anon tho&s;e that carry the Litter. I had two, I took the greate&s;t for my &s;elf and my Child, and had be&s;ides four Mules for my Servants, and two others for my
<PB N="4" REF="5"> Baggage: to conduct them, there were other two Ma&s;ters and two Men. You &s;ee what Charge one is at, to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;eeing you mu&s;t pay not only for their Attendance on you for|wards, but the &s;ame Price for their return back: However, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to their Cu&s;toms, and &s;uffer our &s;elves to be peel'd by them.</P>
<P>I found at <HI>Bayonne</HI> &s;everal <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mores,</HI> and I think a wor&s;e &s;ort of People, and the&s;e are Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Men: I had cau&s;ed my Trunks to be weigh'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> that I might have the le&s;s to do with the&s;e &s;ort of People; but they were more &s;ubtle, or to &s;peak better, more ob&s;tinate than I; &s;o that I was forc'd to give them what&s;oever they demanded. Scarcely was I got clear from them, when the Drums, Trumpets, Pipes, and Violins of the Town, came thundring upon me; they fol|low'd me farther than St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Gate, through which you pa&s;s for <HI>Spain</HI> through <HI>Bi&s;caye:</HI> they play'd each of them in their way, and all together without any Harmony, which was enough to drive any one out of their Sen&s;es: I ordered &s;ome Money to be given them, upon which they left per&s;ecuting me. As &s;oon as we had left <HI>Bayonne,</HI> we enter'd into a large bar|ren Heath, where we &s;aw nothing but Che&s;nut-Trees; but we afterwards pa&s;t along by the Sea, who&s;e Sand makes a delight|ful way, and a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>We arriv'd in good time at St. <HI>John de Luz:</HI> nothing can be plea&s;anter than this Borough, which is the greate&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> and the be&s;t built; there are &s;everal &s;maller Cities: its Port lies between two Mountains, which Nature &s;eems to have ex|pre&s;ly placed to defend it from Storms; the River <HI>Nivelle</HI> di&s;|gorges it &s;elf therein; the Sea comes up very high in it, and the greate&s;t Barks come up commodiou&s;ly to the Key. The Seamen here are very skilful at catching Whales, and other large Fi&s;h. We were here very well entertain'd, &s;o that our Tables were covered with all &s;orts of Wild Fowl: but our Beds were not an&s;werable, being &s;tuck with Feathers who&s;e Pinions ran into our &s;ides, and we wanted Quilts to lay on the top of them: I thought when we were to pay, that I &s;hould have had a large Reckoning, but they only demanded of me half a <HI>Lewis Dor,</HI> when they would have co&s;t more than five Pi&s;toles at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Situation of St. <HI>John de Luz</HI> is extream|ly agreeable.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t &s;pacious part of the Town you &s;ee here a very fine Church, built after the Modern Fa&s;hion; and here is a Pa&s;&s;age over the River <HI>Nivelle,</HI> on a Wooden Bridge of great length. Here are Toll-Gatherers, who make you pay for eve|ry
<PB N="5" REF="5"> thing you carry with you, not excepting your Cloaths: This Tax is demanded at their Plea&s;ure; and it is exce&s;&s;ive on Strangers. I was weary with &s;peaking <HI>French</HI> to 'em, and pro|te&s;ting I was no <HI>Spaniard;</HI> they feigning not to under&s;tand me, &s;neering in my Face, and wrapping up their Heads in their Hooded-Gowns; they &s;eem'd to me to be Thieves, di&s;|gui&s;ed in <HI>Capuchins:</HI> In &s;hort, they tax'd me eighteen Crowns, and would per&s;wade me they u&s;ed me well, tho' I found the contrary. But I have already told you (dear Co&s;in), that when you travel this Country, you mu&s;t &s;tock your &s;elf with Patience, and good &s;tore of Money.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Artois,</HI> which &s;eems a &s;trong place; and a little farther <HI>Orognes,</HI> where the <HI>Bi&s;caye</HI> is &s;poken, without either <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> I de&s;ign'd to lye at <HI>Iron,</HI> which is but three Leagues di&s;tant from St. <HI>John de Luz</HI> and I had &s;et out that after Noon, but the Di&s;pute which we had with the Watch on the Bridge, the Difficulty we had in pa&s;&s;ing the Mountains of <HI>Beotia,</HI> and the ill Weather, joyned to other little Difficul|ties which hapned, were the Cau&s;e that it was Night before we arriv'd on the Borders of the River <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa,</HI> which &s;eparates <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Spain.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd along the way from <HI>Bayonne</HI> thi|ther, little Carriages, on which they tran&s;port every thing, which have only two Iron Wheels, and the Noi&s;e they make is &s;o great, that they are heard a mile off, when there are ma|ny of them together, which often happen; for you often meet with Sixty or Seventy at a time; they are drawn by Oxen. I have &s;een the &s;ame in the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and e&s;peci|ally on the &s;ide of <HI>Axe.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa</HI> is u&s;ually very &s;mall, but the Snows melting, had increas'd it to &s;uch a degree, that we had no &s;mall trouble to pa&s;s it, &s;ome in a Boat, and others &s;wimming on their Mules: The Moon &s;hined very bright, by means of which I was &s;hew'd on the right Hand <HI>the I&s;le of Conference,</HI> where the Marriage of our King was made with <HI>Maria There&s;e, Infanta of Spain.</HI> I &s;aw a while after the Fort of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> which belongs to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;tanding on the Mouth of this &s;mall River: the Flux and Reflux of the Sea arrives here. Our Kings heretofore pretended it belong'd to them: there have been &s;uch great Conte&s;ts hereupon, e&s;pecially by the Inhabitants of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Andaye,</HI> that they have &s;everal times come to Blows. This oblig'd <HI>Lewis</HI> the Twelfth, and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> to agree, That it &s;hould be common to both Na|tions: the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take Toll equally; the&s;e la&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="6"> making tho&s;e pay who pa&s;s into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the former doing the like in relation to tho&s;e who pa&s;s over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>War does not hinder Commerce on this Frontier: it's true they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, &s;eeing they mu&s;t peri&s;h through Want, did they not a&s;&s;i&s;t one another.</P>
<P>This Country call'd <HI>Bi&s;caye,</HI> is full of high Mountains, where are &s;everal Iron Mines: The <HI>Bi&s;cays</HI> climb up the Rocks as ea&s;ily, and with as great &s;wiftne&s;s as Stags: Their Language (if one may call &s;uch <HI>Jargon</HI> Language) is very poor, &s;eeing one Word &s;ignifies abundance of Things: There are none but tho&s;e born in the Country that can under&s;tand it; and I am told, that to the end it may be more particularly theirs, they make no u&s;e of it in Writing; they make their Children to read and write <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> according to which King's Sub|jects they are. It's certain, as &s;oon as I pa&s;t the little River of <HI>Byda&s;&s;oa,</HI> I was not under&s;tood, unle&s;s I &s;pake <HI>Ca&s;tillan;</HI> and not above a quarter of an Hour before, I &s;hould not have been un|der&s;tood had I not &s;poke <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I found on the other &s;ide of this River a Banker of St. <HI>Se|ba&s;tian,</HI> to whom I was recommended: he tarried for me, with two of his Relations; they were cloath'd after the <HI>French</HI> man|ner, but ridiculou&s;ly, their <HI>Ju&s;tau Corps</HI> being &s;hort and large, and their Sleeves hanging down very &s;hort; tho&s;e of their Shirts were &s;o large, that they hung down below their <HI>Ju&s;tan Corps:</HI> they had Bands without Collars, and Periwigs, one of which had enough Hair for four, and &s;o frizled, as made 'em look as if they were frighted; iller-dre&s;t People you cannot meet with. Tho&s;e who wear their own Hair, wear it very long and clo&s;e, parting it on the Crown, and pa&s;s part of it behind their Ears: But what kind of Ears think you? tho&s;e of <HI>Midas</HI> were not larger; and I believe, that to lengthen them, they are &s;tretch'd when they be young: without que&s;tion they find &s;ome kind of Beauty herein.</P>
<P>My three <HI>Spaniards</HI> made me in bad <HI>French</HI> mo&s;t tedious and dull Complements. We pa&s;t through the Bourg of <HI>Tran,</HI> which is about a quarter of a League from the River, and came after|wards to <HI>Irun,</HI> which is di&s;tant about another quarter of a League: this little Town is the fir&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> which you meet with, leaving <HI>France:</HI> it's ill built, the Streets are unequal, and there's nothing one can &s;peak of: We entred into the Inn through the Stable, where are the Stairs on which you mu&s;t a&s;cend to your Chamber; this is the Country's Fa&s;hion. I found this Hou&s;e very light, by a great many Candles, which
<PB N="7" REF="6"> were as &s;mall as Pack-thread; there were at lea&s;t forty in my Chamber, fixt on little bits of Wood; in the mid&s;t of 'em &s;tood a Pan of Coals burning, made of Olive Rhines, to take away the &s;cent of the Candles.</P>
<P>I had a great Supper, which my Gallants, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had caus'd to be made ready for me; but all was &s;o full of Gar|lick, Saffron and Spice, that I could eat nothing: and I had made very bad Cheer, had not my Cook made me a little Ragon of what he could find.</P>
<P>Determining to go but to St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> the next Morning, which is but &s;even or eight Leagues, I thought to Dine before I &s;et out: I was &s;itting at Table, when one of my Women brought me my Watch to wind it up, as it was my Cu&s;tom at Noon; it was a &s;triking Watch, of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s make, and co&s;t me fifty <HI>Lewi&s;es:</HI> My Banker, who was by me, &s;hew'd &s;ome de&s;ire to &s;ee it; I gave it him, with a cu&s;tomary Civility. This was enough: my Blade ri&s;es, makes me a profound Reve|rence, telling me, <Q REND="margSglQuotes">He did not de&s;erve &s;o con&s;iderable a Pre|&s;ent; but &s;uch a Lady as I could make no other: That he would engage his Faith and Reputation, that he would never part with my Watch as long as he liv'd; and that he found him|&s;elf extreamly oblig'd to me. He ki&s;t it at the end of this plea&s;ant Complement, and thru&s;t it into his Pocket, which was deeper than a Sack.</Q> You'l take me to be a gery great Sot, in &s;aying nothing to all this, and I do not wonder at it; but I confe&s;s ingenuou&s;ly, I was &s;o &s;urpriz'd at his Proceeding, that the Watch was out of &s;ight before I could re&s;olve on what I was to do. My Women, and the re&s;t of my Servants who were about me, &s;tared on me, and I on them, blu&s;hing with Shame and Vexation to be thus caught: However, I recollected my &s;elf, and con&s;idered, that this Man was to pay me a good round Sum of Money for the Charge of my Journey, and to return Money to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where I had taken it up; that having Bills of Credit on him, he might u&s;e &s;everal Tricks to me, and Put-offs, which might make me &s;pend twice the Value of the Watch: In fine, I let him part with it, and endeavour'd to do my &s;elf Honour from a thing which gave me great Mortification.</P>
<P>I have learnt, &s;ince this little Adventure, that 'tis the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain,</HI> when any thing is pre&s;ented to one, if he likes it, and ki&s;&s;es your Hand, he may take it with him. This is a ve|ry plea&s;ant Fa&s;hion, and being &s;ufficiently acquainted with it, 'twill be my Fault if I am Trapt again.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>I left this Inn, where they peel'd me &s;ufficiently; for this is a grievous dear Country, and every one &s;trives to be Rich at his Neighbour's Co&s;t. A while after we had left the Town, we entred on the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains, which are &s;o high and &s;teep, that looking down, you &s;ee, not without Horror, the Precipices which environ them: we went thus as far as <HI>Rentery: Don Antonio</HI> (which was my Banker's Name) went before me, and for my more commodious Pa&s;&s;age, he oblig'd me to quit my Litter; for although we had traver&s;t &s;everal Mountains, yet there remain'd more difficult to pa&s;s: he made me enter into a little Boat, which he had prepar'd to go down the Ri|ver of <HI>Andaye,</HI> till we were near the Mouth of the Sea, where we &s;aw the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Gallions; there were three very fine and large ones. Our little Boats were &s;et forth with Gilt Streamers; they were manag'd by Girls, who were very lu&s;ty and hand&s;ome; there are three in each, two that Row, and one who holds the Rudder.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wenches are very well &s;haped, of Che&s;nut Complecti|on, have very good Teeth, Hair Black, which they tie up with Ribbons, in Knots, and &s;o let it hang behind them: They wear a kind of Veil on their Heads, made of Mu&s;ling, em|broidered with Flowers of Gold and Silk, which hangs loo&s;e, and covers their Brea&s;ts: they wear Pendants in their Ears of Gold and Pearls, and Bracelets of Coral; they have a kind of <HI>Ju&s;tau Corps,</HI> like our <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> who&s;e Sleeves are very &s;trait: I can a&s;&s;ure you they charm'd me. I was told, the&s;e Wenches &s;wim like Fi&s;hes, and &s;uffer neither Women nor Men among them.

<P>My Cook, who is a <HI>Ga&s;con,</HI> and exactly of the Humour of tho&s;e of that Country, was in one of our Boats behind us, at &s;ome di&s;tance, very near a young <HI>Bi&s;caneer,</HI> who appeared to him very hand&s;ome; he contented not him&s;elf with telling her as much, but would have rudely turn'd up her Veil. She being not u&s;ed to this &s;ort of plain Dealing, without any Words broke his Head with her Oar: Having done this Exploit, Fear &s;eizing on her, &s;he threw her&s;elf immediately into the Wa|ter, tho' the Sea&s;on was very cold, and &s;wam with great &s;wift|ne&s;s; but having all her Cloaths on, and it being far to the Shoar, her &s;trength began to fail her. Several of the&s;e Wenches who &s;aw this at Land, leapt immediately into their Boats to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when tho&s;e who had remain'd in the Boat with the Cook, fearing the lo&s;s of their Companion, fell on him like two Furies, re&s;olving by all means to drown him, and had like two or three times to have overturn'd their little Ve&s;&s;el, which we beholding from ours, had much a-do to part and appea&s;e them.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, the fooli&s;h <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> was &s;o cruelly handled, that he was all over blood; and my Banker told me, that the&s;e young <HI>Bi&s;caneers</HI> provoked, are wor&s;e then Lions. In fine, we came to Land, but were &s;carcely on Shoar, but we &s;aw this Wench which was &s;aved out of the Water, making up to|wards us, with near fifty others, each with an Oar on their Shoulder, marching in Battle-ray, with Fife and Drum; when &s;he who was to be the Mouth of the Company, advanc'd, and calling me &s;everal times <HI>Andria,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Madam,</HI> (for that's all I could retain of her Speech) gave me to under|&s;tand, That they would have my Cook's Skin, if Satisfaction were not made proportionably to the Damage done their Com|panion's Cloaths.

<P><HI>Don Antonio,</HI> to make me amends for the Pre&s;ent he had wrung from me, (I cannot but often mention it, lying on my Heart as it does) undertook to make Peace: He found that my Cook, who thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently beaten, had Rea&s;on to give nothing; and therefore he di&s;tributed &s;ome Pieces of Money among this Marine Troop: On receipt of which they &s;et forth lowder Hollow's than before, and wi&s;h'd me a good Journey, and &s;peedy Return, each of 'em dancing and &s;inging at the &s;ound of their Pipes and Tabors.</P>

<P>We entred into a very rough Way, and a&s;cending along ve|ry narrow Paths, on the &s;ide of which there are Precipices; &s;o that I was greatly afraid le&s;t the Mules which carry'd my Litter &s;hould &s;tumble: We afterwards pa&s;t over a large Sandy Field. I tarry'd &s;ome time in the Convent of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> which &s;tands near the River of <HI>Andaye:</HI> We pa&s;t over it on a very long Wooden Bridge; and though we were near St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> yet we could not then perceive it, becau&s;e a Mount of Sand hid the Town: It's &s;ituated on the Foot of a Moun|tain, which &s;erves on one &s;ide as a Rampart again&s;t the Sea, and the Ve&s;&s;els come to the Foot of this Mountain, to &s;helter them from the Storms; for here ari&s;e extraordinary Tempe&s;ts, that the Ships at Anchor peri&s;h in the Port: it's deep, and defended by two Moles, which leave only as much room as is requi&s;ite for one Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ing at a time. They have rais'd here a great four Square Tower, where there is ever a good Garri&s;on to defend the Place, in ca&s;e of A&s;&s;ault: it was a fine Day for the Sea&s;on: I found the Town very plea&s;ant, being &s;urrounded with a double Wall: there are mounted &s;everal Pieces of Can|non on that part towards the Sea, with Ba&s;tions and Half Moons: the Town is &s;ituated in a Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> call'd <HI>Guipu&s;coa:</HI> the Out-parts are exceeding plea&s;ant, by rea&s;on that the Sea, as I now &s;aid, &s;erves for a Channel to it: the Streets of this Town are long and large, pav'd with great White Stones, which are always clean: the Hou&s;es are well enough; and the Churches decent, in which the Altars are of Wood, on which are hung little Pictures, from top to bottom. Mines of Iron and Steel abound in this Country, finer and purer perhaps than in any other Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this is the greate&s;t part of their Trade. Here the Wool which comes from <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> is embark'd, which makes a con&s;iderable part of their Traffick. <HI>Bilbo</HI> and St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> are two of the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable Ports which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has on the Ocean: The Ca&s;tle &s;tands very high, and may make an indifferent Defence: here are mounted &s;everal fine Pieces of Cannon, and there are a great many along the Ramparts; but the Garri&s;on is &s;o weak, that the Women might conquer them with their Di&s;taffs.</P>
<P>Every thing is as dear in this Town as in <HI>Paris,</HI> yet they fare well here: Fi&s;h is excellent, and I was told Fruit was the &s;ame. I lay in the be&s;t Inn, and when I had been there &s;ome time, <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> &s;ent his Gentlemen to enquire, whether his Vi&s;it would not be trouble&s;ome to me; My Banker, who knew him, and who was then in my Chamber, told me, he
<PB N="11" REF="8"> was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of great Quality, Nephew to the Duke <HI>D' Alva;</HI> that he came from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and was going to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>I receiv'd him with that Civility which was due to his Birth, and &s;oon thereunto adjoyn'd particular Re&s;pects to his own Me|rit: He is a Gentleman of good Pre&s;ence, has Wit and Po|litene&s;s is Complai&s;ant and Agreeable; he &s;peaks as good <HI>French</HI> as I do; but under&s;tanding <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and being de&s;irous to &s;peak it better, we therefore di&s;cours'd only in that Lan|guage.</P>
<P>I was very well &s;atisfied with his Carriage. He told me he came Po&s;t hither from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and if I pleas'd, he would in|crea&s;e my Train, and be one of my Company. I thought he je&s;ted, and an&s;wered him accordingly; but he added, The ways were &s;o full of Snow, that indeed they could not ride Po&s;t; that he could make more &s;peed on Hor&s;es than in Litters, but the Honour of accompanying me, made abundant Recom|pence for that. In a word, I &s;ay he was a civil Per&s;on, and came no way &s;hort of the Gallantry natural to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cava|liers: I therefore con&s;ider'd, how advantageous it might prove to have a Man of this Quality, and Country, who could make him&s;elf be heard and obey'd by the Muletteers, who have Iron Souls, and no Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>I told him, I was very glad I met with him, and the Fati|gue of the Road would be le&s;s'ned by his Company. He im|mediately thereupon ordered his Gentleman to find a Litter for him: It being late, he took his leave of me, and I betook my &s;elf to eat a good Supper; for, my deer Cou&s;in, I am none of tho&s;e Romantick Ladies that never eat.</P>
<P>Scarcely did I begin to &s;leep, when I heard &s;ome-body &s;peak <HI>French</HI> &s;o near me, that I thought at fir&s;t 'twas in my Chamber; but having hearkned with more attention, I found 'twas in a Chamber &s;eparated from mine by only &s;ome thin Boards, and tho&s;e ill joynted: I drew my Curtain, and &s;aw Light through the Crevices, and at the &s;ame time two young Women, the elde&s;t of which appeared not to be above Seven|teen or Eighteen; neither of 'em were of tho&s;e Beauties with|out Defect, yet were they &s;o pretty, &s;pake &s;o &s;weetly, and had &s;uch great &s;weetne&s;s on their Countenances, that I was much taken with 'em.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t, who &s;eem'd to, continue the Conver&s;ation, &s;aid to the other, <HI>No, my dear Si&s;ter, there is no Remedy to our Misfortunes; we must die, or get them out of the Clutches of this vilanous Dotard. I am re&s;olute for any thing,</HI> reply'd the other, in uttering a deep &s;igh, <HI>&s;hould it co&s;t me my Life: What
<PB N="12" REF="9"> remains? Have we not &s;acrific'd all for them?</HI> Then con&s;idering a while their Misfortunes, they mutually embrac'd, and began to weep in a mo&s;t piteous manner: And having con&s;ulted a while, and &s;pake &s;ome other Words, the greate&s;t part of which were interrupted by their Sighs, they concluded on Writing, which they did; and here is mo&s;t of what I heard them read to one another:</P>
<P><HI>Judge not of my Love and Grief by my Words, I have none can expre&s;s either the one or the other; but remember you Ruine me, unle&s;s you betake your &s;elf to the greate&s;t Extremities again&s;t him that per&s;ecutes us. He has now &s;ent me word,</HI> That if we delay our Departure, he will have us &s;eiz'd. <HI>Con&s;ider what he de&s;erves from this ba&s;e &V;&s;age of us; and remember you owe me all, &s;ee|ing you owe me my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>I think the other Billet was in the&s;e Terms,</P>
<P><HI>Could I &s;ecure thee thy Happine&s;s, in lo&s;ing mine, I love thee &s;ufficiently to offer thee &s;uch a Sacrifice:: Yes, I would fly from thee, could&s;t thou be Happy without me; but I know thy Heart too well to believe this. Yet thou remaine&s;t as Quiet in thy Pri|&s;on, as if I were with thee: Break thy Chains without more de|lay; puni&s;h the Enemy of our Loves. My Heart &s;hall be thy Recompen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Having made up the&s;e Billets, they went out together; and I profe&s;s, I was not a little unea&s;ie for 'em, and no le&s;s curious to know the&s;e poor Ladies Misfortunes. This hindred me from &s;leeping, and I was expecting their Return, when immediate|ly there was a great Uproar in the Hou&s;e: I &s;aw an old Man enter the Chamber, attended by a great many Servants: He held one of the&s;e young Women by the Hair of the Head, which he had wound about his Arm, and drew her after him, as a wretched Sacrifice. Her Si&s;ter was not treated with le&s;s Cruelty, by tho&s;e who led her: <HI>Perfidious Wretches,</HI> &s;aid he to them, <HI>not content with the irreparable Injury you do my Nephews, you would per&s;wade them to be my Executioners? Had I not &s;urpri|&s;ed you with the&s;e &s;educing Letters what might have hapned? What dreadful Tragedies might I not have expected? But you &s;hall pay once for all: as &s;oon as ever the Day appears I will have you puni&s;ht as you de&s;erve. Ah Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he whom he held, <HI>remember we are Women of Quality, and that our Alliance can be no Di&s;honour to you; that your Nephews have given us their Faith, and we them ours; that in &s;o tender an Age we have left all for their &s;akes; that we are &s;trangers, and have no Friends here: What will become of us? We dare not return to our Relations: if you are for constraining us to this, or for putting us in Pri&s;on, let us intreat you rather pre|&s;ently to di&s;patch us out of the World.</HI></P>

<P>The Tears which they &s;hed in &s;uch abundance, wrought in me the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion: And had the old Man been as tender as I, he had &s;oon freed 'em from their Trouble.</P>
<P>My Women, who had heard &s;uch a great Di&s;turbance, and &s;o near my Chamber, aro&s;e, in the fear of &s;ome Mi&s;hap to|wards me: I made Signs to them to draw near &s;oftly, and to behold through the Boards this &s;orrowful Spectacle: We hearkned to what they &s;aid, when two Men, with their Swords in their Hands, entred into my Chamber, the Door of which my Women had left open: They had De&s;pair painted on their Faces, and Rage in their Eyes: I was &s;o greatly frighted, that I cannot expre&s;s it to you. They looked on one another with|out &s;peaking a word; and having heard the old Man's Voice, they ran on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>I did not doubt but 'twas the two Lovers; and 'twas them indeed, who entred like two Lions into this Chamber: They &s;truck the&s;e Servants with &s;o great Terror, that never a one of 'em dared approach his Ma&s;ter, to defend him, when his Ne|phews advance towards him, and &s;et their Swords to his Throat: <HI>Barbarian,</HI> &s;aid they to him, <HI>can you thus u&s;e Women of Quality, that are to be our Wives? Becau&s;e you are our Guardian mu&s;t you therefore be our Tyrant? And is not the &s;eparating of us from what we love, the taking of our Lives from us? It's now in our Power to take a ju&s;t Vengeance of you; but we cannot do it to a Man of your Age, who cannot defend him&s;elf: give us then your Word, and &s;wear by all that's Good and Holy, That in Acknowledgment for the Life we give you, you will contribute to our Happine&s;s, and &s;uffer us to perform what we have promis'd.</HI></P>
<P>The poor old Wretch was &s;o afrighted, that he could hardly make any An&s;wer: However, he &s;wore more than they would have him; he fell on his Knees, and ki&s;t an hundred times his Thumb laid a-cro&s;s one of his Fingers, after the manner of <HI>Spain.</HI> Yet he told them, <HI>whatever he had done, was onely in regard to their Intere&s;ts; however, he would not in any &s;ort, for the future, oppo&s;e their Inclinations, in reference to this Marriage.</HI> Two of the Dome&s;ticks took him under the Arm, and rather carried him away than led him. Then the Gentlemen &s;eeing them&s;elves free, threw them&s;elves in their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Arms; they &s;aid to one another, whatever Grief, Love and Joy do u&s;ually in|&s;pire in &s;uch Occa&s;ions. But in Troth, one mu&s;t have a Heart as af|fected and content as theirs, to repeat all the&s;e things: they are only proper to Per&s;ons more tender than you are, my dear Co&s;in. But I hope you will excu&s;e this Relation; I was &s;o tired, in having not yet &s;lept, that I could &s;carce hear any more, but

As &s;oon as he thought it a proper time to Vi&s;it me, he came: Having thankt him for his Pre&s;ent, I ask'd him, Whether he had heard nothing of what had pa&s;t in the Night? He told me, <HI>No,</HI> for he had lain in another part of the Hou&s;e. I was about relating to him what I knew, when our Ho&s;te&s;s entred into the Chamber: &s;he came from the two Gentlemen who had given me that Di&s;turbance, with the Swords in their Hands, intreating me to receive their Excu&s;es. She likewi&s;e told me, That two young Ladies de&s;ired they might wait on me, and ki&s;s my Hand. I an&s;wer'd the&s;e Civilities as I ought; and they &s;oon entred.</P>
<P>What charming Effects does the Return of Joy pro|duce? I found the&s;e Gentlemen very well &s;haped, and the&s;e Ladies very lovely; neither one nor the other had any more on their Countenances the Characters of De&s;pair; an Air of Gaiety di&s;play'd it&s;elf in all their Words and Ge&s;tures. The Elde&s;t of the two Brethren made the mo&s;t hand&s;ome Excu&s;e as is po&s;&s;ible for his Mi&s;take in entring my Chamber: he ad|ded, <Q REND="margQuotes">He had well ob&s;erv'd the Fear he had caus'd me; but told me, that in that Moment he was &s;o tran&s;ported, that he was capable of no other Thought but the Re&s;cuing his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</Q> <HI>You would have been to blame,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>&s;hould you have thought of any thing el&s;e: However, if it be true, you are willing to make me Satisfaction for the Alarum you have giv'n me, you mu&s;t not refu&s;e the gratifying my Curio&s;ity: With the&s;e fair Ladies leave, inform we what has reduced all of you to the&s;e Extremities you were in.</HI> He lookt on them, as if it were to ask their Approbation, which they willingly granted; and he thus began: <HI>We are two Brothers, Madam, Natives of</HI> Burgos, <HI>and of one of the be&s;t Families of this City. We were very young, when we fell into the Hands of an &V;ncle, who took care of our Education and E&s;tates, which are &s;o con&s;iderable, that we need not envy others on that account;</HI> Don Diego <HI>(is our &V;ncle's Name) he had made long &s;ince a firm Friend&s;hip with a Gentle|man living near</HI> Blaye, <HI>who&s;e Merit is far above his Fortune; he is call'd</HI> Mon&s;ieur de Me&s;ignac: <HI>our &V;ncle re&s;olving to &s;end us for &s;ome time into</HI> France, <HI>he wrote hereupon to his Friend, who offered him his Hou&s;e, which he joyfully accepted.

<P><HI>My Brother at first conceal'd from me his growing Pa&s;&s;ion, and I hid mine from him; we were both of us very melancholly; the trouble of loving, without being lov'd again, and the fear of di&s;|plea&s;ing tho&s;e who caus'd our Pa&s;&s;ion, all this cruelly tormented us; but a new Vexation did greatly increa&s;e our Di&s;quiet, which was a re&s;tle&s;s Jealou&s;ie we had one of another: My Brother plainly &s;aw I was in Love, and thought 'twas with his Mistre&s;s; I lookt on him likewi&s;e as my Rival; and we bore &s;uch Hatred to one another, as might have tran&s;ported us to the greate&s;t Extre|mities: but that I re&s;olutely determin'd one day to di&s;cover my Sentiments to</HI> Mademoi&s;elle de Me&s;&s;ignac; <HI>but wanting Courage to &s;peak to her my &s;elf, I wrote &s;ome Ver&s;es in a little Book touch|ing my Pa&s;&s;ion for her, and dextrou&s;ly &s;lid it into her Pocket, without her perceiving me. My Brother, who had always an Eye on me, ob&s;erv'd it, and playing with her, he took out the Ver&s;es, and found 'em to contain a re&s;pectful and pa&s;&s;ionate Declaration of Love to her: he kept them till Night, when being withdrawn into my Chamber, with the greatest Inquietude, he came to me, and tenderly embracing me, he told me, He was heartily glad at the notice he had of my being in love with</HI> Mademoi&s;elle de Me&s;|&s;ignac.</P>
<P><HI>I remain'd as one Thunder&s;truck; I &s;aw my Papers in his Hands; I imagin'd &s;he had made them a Sacrifice to him, and that he came to in&s;ult on my Misfortune. He &s;aw in my Eyes and Counte|nance part of what I thought:</HI> Undeceive your &s;elf, <HI>continued he,</HI> &s;he gave 'em not to me; I have taken 'em without her &s;eeing them: I'll be &s;erviceable to you for the obtaining her; be you the &s;ame to me in relation to her elder Si&s;ter. <HI>I then embraced him, and promis'd him all he de&s;ired. Thus we mutually rendred good Offices to one another; and our Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were not then acquainted with the power of Love, began to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to hear talk of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It would be to abu&s;e your Patience, to tell you, Madam, how we came at length by our Cares and A&s;&s;iduities to win their Hearts.

<P>The Gentleman here &s;topt, and I found he had related his little Hi&s;tory with great Ingenuity. I thank't him for it, and offer'd the&s;e Ladies my Endeavours, and tho&s;e of my Friends, to appea&s;e their Family: Which Offers they accept|ed, and te&s;tifi'd their Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Some Ladies of the Town, who came to &s;ee me, wou'd &s;top me; they propo&s;ed to me to go to the Religio&s;es, who&s;e Convent is &s;o plea&s;antly &s;ituated, that the Pro&s;pect has no Bounds: You may &s;ee thence, at the &s;ame time, the Sea, Ships, Towns, Woods and Fields. They &s;pake much in prai&s;e of the Voices, Beauty, and good Humour of the&s;e Religio&s;es. Add to this, that the ill Weather was &s;o increa&s;t, and the Snow fal'n in &s;o great abundance, that no body advi&s;ed me to proceed in my Journey. I was in &s;u&s;pence a while, but the Impatience I had to be at <HI>Madrid,</HI> prevail'd over all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and I parted the next Morning. I have receiv'd of my Banker the Money I want.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that the Inhabitants of this Town have a particular Priviledge, and of which they are not a little proud; which is, That when they Treat of any Affairs with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that it is directly with him, he is oblig'd to &s;peak with them bare-headed. I could not get the Rea&s;on from 'em for this.</P>
<P>I am told I mu&s;t furni&s;h my &s;elf with good &s;tore of Pro|vi&s;ion, to prevent &s;tarving in &s;ome places through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s; and Gammons of Bacon, dried Tongues, being much e&s;teem'd in this Country, I have therefore taken up a good quantity; and as to the re&s;t, we have &s;ufficiently pro|vided. Now this being the Po&s;t-day, I would not omit this occa&s;ion of informing you of what has hapned to me; and te&s;tifying, that I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. II.</HEAD>
<P>I Re-a&s;&s;ume, Dear Cou&s;in, without any Compliments, the Sequel of my Travels: In leaving St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> we entred into a very rough Way, which brings you to &s;uch terrible &s;teep Mountains, that you cannot a&s;cend them without climb|ing; they are call'd <HI>Sierra de</HI> St. <HI>Adrian.</HI> They &s;hew only Precipices and Rocks, on which a puling Lover may meet with certain Death, if he has a mind to it. Pine Trees of an extraordinary heighth crown the top of the&s;e Mountains. As far as the Sight will reach you &s;ee nothing but De&s;arts, cut with Streams clearer than Cry&s;tal. Near the highe&s;t part of Mount St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> you meet with an elevated Rock, which &s;eems to have been placed in the mid&s;t of the way to block up the Pa&s;&s;age, and thus &s;eparate <HI>Bi&s;caye</HI> from the <HI>Old Ca&s;tille.</HI></P>
<P>A tedious and painful Labour has pierced this ma&s;s of Stone in manner of a Vault; you may walk forty or fifty Paces un|der it, without &s;ight of Day, but what comes by the Over|tures at each Entry, which are &s;hut by great Doors: You find under this Vault an Inn, which is left in the Winter, by Rea|&s;on of the Snows: You &s;ee here likewi&s;e a little Chappel of St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> and &s;everal Caverns, where Thieves commonly re|treat; &s;o that it is dangerous pa&s;&s;ing here without being in a condition of Defence. When he had traver&s;t the Rock, we &s;till a little a&s;cended, to rrrive to the top of the Moun|tain, which is held to be the highe&s;t of the <HI>Pyraneds;</HI> it is wholly covered with great A&s;h Trees. There was never a finer place of Solitude; the Springs run here as in the Vallies: the &s;ight is only bounded by the Weakne&s;s of the Eyes; Shades and Silence here reign, and the Eccho's an|&s;wers on every &s;ide. We began afterwards to de&s;cend down fa&s;ter than we climed up: We &s;aw in &s;ome parts little barren Plains, many &s;andy places, and ever and anon Mountains co|vered with great Rocks. It is not without Rea&s;on, that in pa&s;&s;ing &s;o near, you fear, le&s;t &s;ome one of 'em &s;hould get loo&s;e, which would certainly over-whelm one; for you &s;ee &s;ome which are fall'n from the top, and hang in their pa&s;&s;age on other Clefts; and the&s;e finding nothing in the way, would give a &s;orry Diver&s;ion to a Traveller. I made all the&s;e Reflections at my ea&s;e; for I was alone in my Litter, with my Child, who did not at all di&s;turb my Thoughts. A River call'd <HI>&V;rrola,</HI> big enough, but which was increa&s;ed by the Torrents, and melt|ed Snow, &s;lides along the Way, and breaks forth into parti|cular
<PB N="19" REF="12"> Streams in &s;ome places, which fall with a great impetuo|&s;ity and noi&s;e, and make a very plea&s;ant &s;ound and &s;ight.</P>
<P>We meet not here with tho&s;e fine Ca&s;tles to be &s;een on the Banks of the <HI>Loire,</HI> which make Travellers call it the Country of <HI>Fairies.</HI> Here are on the&s;e Mountains only &s;ome Shepherds Cottages, and &s;ome few Hovels, and at that di&s;tance, that you mu&s;t go a great way before you can find them; yet all the&s;e Natural Objects, though very melancholly ones, yet have &s;omething that is very taking in them. The Snows were &s;o high, that we had always twenty Men, who made way for us with Shovels. You will perhaps imagine this co&s;t me very much; but here are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;ht Orders, and tho&s;e &s;o well ob&s;erv'd, that the Inhabitants of a Village are oblig'd to meet Travellers, and be their Guides to the next; and no one being bound to give them any thing, the lea&s;t Liberality there|fore &s;atisfies them. To this fir&s;t Care there is added another, which is that of Ringing the Bells without-cea&s;ing, to give no|tice to Travellers, where they may retreat in &s;tormy Weather. They told me, there had not fall'n this forty Years &s;o much Snow as we met with, there having been no Fro&s;t for a great while in this Province.</P>
<P>Our Troop was &s;o great, that we might count our &s;elves no ways inferiour to tho&s;e Famous Caravans which go to <HI>Mecha;</HI> for without reckoning my Train, and that of <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> there joyn'd with us near St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> three Knights, with their Attendants, who return'd from their Commander|&s;hips of St. <HI>James;</HI> there were two of this Order, and one of that of <HI>Alcantara:</HI> The fir&s;t wear Red Cro&s;&s;es, in form of an embroidered Sword, on their Shoulders; and he of <HI>Alcantara</HI> had a Green one. One of the two fir&s;t is of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> the other of <HI>Galicia,</HI> and the third of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> they are of good Families; he of <HI>Andalou&s;ia</HI> calls him &s;elf, <HI>Donesteve de Carvaial;</HI> he of <HI>Galicia, Don Sancho Sanniento,</HI> and the other of <HI>Cata|lonia, Don Frederic de Cardonne;</HI> they are Per&s;ons of good Meine, and well acquainted with the World. I receiv'd all po&s;|&s;ible Civilities from them, having much of the <HI>French</HI> Humour in them. They have travelled over the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this has rendred them &s;o Polite. We went to lye at <HI>Gala|reta;</HI> this is a Borough a little di&s;tant from Mount <HI>Adrian,</HI> &s;ituated in the little Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> I now mention'd na|med <HI>Alava,</HI> which makes a Part of <HI>Bi&s;caye;</HI> we had there but bad Entertainment. They reckon it eleven Leagues from thence to St. <HI>Seba&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>We had better Way from <HI>Galareta</HI> to <HI>Victoria,</HI> than we had
<PB N="20" REF="13"> before: The Country here yields much Corn and Grapes; and the Villages lie very thick together: We found here Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Men, who made us pay both for the Cloaths and Money we carried with us: they were not very exacting with us, be|cau&s;e our Company was too large to be impo&s;ed on. <HI>Don Fer|nand de Toledo</HI> had inform'd me over Night, that we were to travel near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Quebare,</HI> which was &s;aid to be haunt|ed with a Spirit, telling me a thou&s;and extravagant Stories, which were readily &s;wallow'd by the Inhabitants of the Country, and which were &s;o effectually believ'd by them, that no body would live there. I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee this place; for although I am naturally as fearful as another, yet am not afraid of Gho&s;ts; and if I were, our Company was &s;o numerous, as would animate the greate&s;t Coward: we &s;truck off a little to the left, and came to the Borough of <HI>Quebara;</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Inn where we entred, had the Keys of the Ca&s;tle; he told us, in going along with us, <HI>That the</HI> Duende, which is to &s;ay the Spirit, <HI>could not endure Company; yet if we were a thou&s;and together, he would, if he were minded, beat us all, in &s;uch a manner, as to leave us for dead.</HI> I began to tremble; <HI>Don Fer|nand de Toledo,</HI> and <HI>Don Fredric de Cordonne,</HI> who gave me their Hands, perceiving my Fear, bur&s;t out into Laughter: I grew a&s;ham'd, and pretended to gain Courage; and &s;o we entred the Ca&s;tle, which might have pa&s;t for a fine one, had it been kept in order: It had no Furniture, except an old Ta|pi&s;try Hanging in a great Hall, which repre&s;ented the Amours of <HI>Don Pedro the Cruel,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria de Padilla:</HI> &s;he is repre&s;ented fitting like a Queen in the mid&s;t of other Ladies, and the King placing on her Head a Crown of Flowers: In ano|ther part &s;he &s;ate under the &s;hade of a Wood, the King &s;hew|ing her a Hawk on his Fi&s;t: And again, in another, &s;he ap|pears in a Warrier's Dre&s;s, and the King in Armour pre&s;ents her with a Sword; which makes me believe that &s;he had been in &s;ome Warlike Expedition with him. She was very ill re|pre&s;ented; and <HI>Don Fernand</HI> told me, <Q REND="margSglQuotes">He had &s;een her Effigies el&s;ewhere, by which &s;he appeared to be the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t cruel Woman of her time; and that the Figures in this Tapi&s;try re&s;embled neither her nor the King: his Name, Cipher and Arms were every-where on it.</Q> We went up into a Tower, on the top of which was a Dungeon, and 'twas there where the Spirit inhabited; but without doubt he was abroad, for we neither &s;aw nor heard him, or any of his Companions; and having &s;een &s;ufficiently this great Building, we left it to pur&s;ue our Journey. In approaching <HI>Victoria,</HI> we pa&s;t over a
<PB N="21" REF="13"> mo&s;t delightful Plain, at the end of which &s;tands a Town &s;itua|ted in this Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> I lately mention'd, call'd <HI>Alava;</HI> this is the Capital Town of it, as well as the fir&s;t of <HI>Ca&s;tille:</HI> It is inclo&s;ed with two Walls, one of which is old, and the other new; be&s;ides this, it has no other Fortifications. After I had refre&s;h'd my &s;elf a while here, 'twas propo&s;ed to me to go to a Play; but in tarrying till it began, I had no &s;mall Di|ver&s;ion, in &s;eeing come into the mo&s;t &s;pacious place of the Town, four Companies of young Men, preceded by Drums and Trumpets: they marched &s;everal times round, and in fine, im|mediately began the Fight with Snow-balls, which they threw at one another with &s;uch Fiercene&s;s, that they were all very well pelted in the end: they were above two hundred who fought this Battle. To tell you of tho&s;e who fell, or recovered their Feet again, and the Shouts and Acclamations of the Peo|ple, will be needle&s;s; and I was obliged to leave them thus en|gaged, to go to the place where the Play was to be repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>When I entred into the Room, the People &s;et forth an hol|lowing, <HI>Mira, mira!</HI> which is to &s;ay, look, Look,! The Decorati|on of the Theatre was not over Magnificent; it was rais'd on Barrels, and ill-rang'd Plancks; the Windows of the Room were open, for they u&s;ed no Candles or Flambeaux, whence you may ea&s;ily imagine this much takes away from the Beauty of the Sight. They acted the Life of St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> and when the Players &s;aid any thing which pleas'd the Company, all the People cried out, <HI>Victoria, Victoria;</HI> I was informed this was the Cu&s;tom of the Country. I ob&s;erv'd the Devil was no other ways clad than the re&s;t, having only a pair of Stockins of a Flame-colour, and a pair of Horns to di&s;tingui&s;h him. This Comedy con&s;i&s;ted only of three Acts, and they are all no more: at the end of each &s;erious Act, another began of Farce and Plea&s;antry, wherein appear'd him they called <HI>El Gracio&s;o,</HI> which is to &s;ay, the Buffoon, who, among much in&s;ipid Stuff, &s;ays &s;ometimes &s;omething that is le&s;s nau&s;eous: The Interludes were mixt with Dances, to the &s;ound of the Harps and Guitars: The Actors had Ca&s;tagnets, and a little Hat on their Heads, without which they never Dance, and then 'tis a Saraband; they &s;eem not to walk, they &s;lip along &s;o lightly. Their man|ner is wholly different from ours: they move too much their Arms, and often pa&s;s their Hands on their Hats and Face, and that with no ill Grace; they play admirably well on the Ca&s;tagnets.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, (Dear Co&s;in) I would not have you think the&s;e Actors, for being in a little City, do much differ from tho&s;e of <HI>Madrid.</HI> I was told, that tho&s;e of the King are a
<PB N="22" REF="14"> little better; but, in a word, both act what they call <HI>Las Come|dias Famo&s;as,</HI> which is to &s;ay, The fine&s;t and mo&s;t famous Comedies; which in truth are very ridiculous: For Example, when St. <HI>Anthony</HI> &s;aid his <HI>Confiteor,</HI> which he did often enough, all the Spectators fell down on their Knees, and gave them|&s;elves &s;uch rude <HI>Mea Culpa's,</HI> as was enough to beat the breath out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>Here would be a proper place to &s;peak of their Habits; but you had better excu&s;e me till I come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> le&s;t I tire you with Repetitions: Yet I mu&s;t tell you, that all the La|dies I &s;ay, in this Company, had a prodigious quantity of Red, which begins ju&s;t under the Eye, and pa&s;&s;es from the Chin to the Ears, and Shoulders, to their very Hands; &s;o that I ne|ver &s;aw any Radi&s;hes of a finer Colour.</P>
<P>The Lady Governe&s;s of the Town drew near to me; &s;he ju&s;t toucht my Cloaths, and ha&s;tily drew back her Hand, as if &s;he had burnt her Fingers. I bid her in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> not to be a|fraid: She at length familiariz'd her &s;elf, and told me, <Q REND="margSglQuotes">'Twas not through fear of any thing el&s;e but of di&s;plea&s;ing me: that 'twas no new thing to her to &s;ee <HI>French</HI> Ladies: and that if &s;he might, &s;he would gladly dre&s;s her &s;elf after their Fa&s;hion.</Q> She ordered Chocolate to be brought her, with which &s;he pre|&s;ented me; which is far better here than in <HI>France.</HI> The Play being ended, I took my Leave of her, having thanked her for her Civilities.</P>
<P>The next Morning, as I entred the Church to hear Ma&s;s, I e&s;pied an Hermit, who had the Air of a Per&s;on of Quality, and yet begg'd an Alms of me, with &s;uch great Humility, that I was greatly &s;urpriz'd at it: <HI>Don Fernand</HI> having notice of it, drew near, and &s;aid to me, <HI>The Per&s;on whom you behold, Madam, is of an illu&s;trious Family, and of great Merit, but his Fortune very &V;nhappy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You rai&s;e in me,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>a great Curio&s;ity to know more; and therefore I mu&s;t beg your Favour to &s;atisfie it. You may com|mand any thing of me,</HI> replied he, <HI>Madam; but I am not &s;o throughly inform'd of his Adventures, to undertake the relating them to you; and I believe 'twere better I engage him into a Re|cital of them him&s;elf.</HI> He left me, and went immediately to Embrace him, with the greate&s;t Civilities and Tenderne&s;s: <HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> and <HI>Don E&s;teve de Carvajal,</HI> had al|ready acco&s;ted him, as their old Acquaintance; and when <HI>Don Fernand</HI> had joyn'd them, they all earne&s;tly intreated him to come with them when Ma&s;s was over. He as earne&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf; but being told, I was a Stranger, and much impor|tuned,
<PB N="23" REF="14"> that I might learn from him&s;elf, what had oblig'd him to turn Hermit; he at length con&s;ented, on condition I would permit him to bring one of his Friends, who was perfectly knowing in what related to him: <HI>Do us Ju&s;tice,</HI> continued he, <HI>and judge whether 'tis fit for me to relate &s;uch Particularities in this Habit I wear.</HI> They found he had Rea&s;on, and pray'd him to bring his Friend, which he did a while after I was at my Lodgings: He pre&s;ented a very fine Cavalier to me; and taking leave of us very civilly, he told him, <Q REND="margSglQuotes">He &s;hould be ob|lig'd to him, if he would &s;atisfie, the Curio&s;ity which <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo</HI> had giv'n me, of knowing the Spring of his Misfortunes.</Q> This Gentleman took place by me, and began in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<P><HI>I think my &s;elf very Happy, Madam, that my Friend has cho&s;hen me to &s;atisfie the De&s;ire you have of knowing his Adventures; but I fear I &s;hall not acquit my &s;elf &s;o well as I would: The Per&s;on who&s;e Hi&s;tory you wou'd learn, has been one of the fine&s;t Gentlemen in the World; it would be hard to make a Judgment of him now; he is buried, as it were in his Hermit's Habit. He was an ex|ceeding graceful Per&s;on, well &s;haped, of an excellent Meine, and Noble Air: And in fine, had all the Accompli&s;hments, both Natu|ral and Acquired, of a Per&s;on of Quality, being liberal, witty and brave. He was born at</HI> Cagliari, <HI>Capital of the I&s;le of</HI> Sar|dogne, <HI>one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and richest Families of all that Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was brought up with one of his Co&s;in-Germans; and the &s;impathy which was &s;ound in their Humours, and Inclinations, was &s;o great, that they were more &s;trictly united by Friend&s;hip than Blood: they hid no Secret from each other. And when the Marqui&s;s</HI> Barbaran <HI>was married (which was his Co&s;in's Name,) their Friend&s;hip continued in the &s;ame force.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He married one of the fine&s;t Women in the World, and the mo&s;t Accompli&s;ht; &s;he was then not above Fourteen: She was Heire&s;s to a very Noble E&s;tate and Family. The Marque&s;s every day di&s;|covered new Charms in the Wit and Per&s;on of his Wife, which like|wi&s;e increa&s;ed every day his Pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;peaks without cea&s;ing, of his Happine&s;s, to</HI> Don Lewis de Barbaron; <HI>which is the Name, Madam, of my Friend; and when any Affairs oblig'd the Mar|que&s;s to leave her, he conjured him to stay with the Marchione&s;s, thereby to le&s;&s;en the Trouble of his Ab&s;ence. But alas! how hard is it when one is at an Age uncapable of &s;erious Reflections, to &s;ee continually &s;o fair a Woman, &s;o young and aimable; and to &s;ee her with Indifference!</HI> Don Lewis <HI>was already de&s;perately in Love with the Marchione&s;s, and thought then 'twas only for her
<PB N="24" REF="15"> Husband's &s;ake: Whil&s;t he was in this Mi&s;take, &s;he fell danger|ou&s;ly &s;ick; at which he grew &s;o dreadful melancholly, that he then knew, but too late, this was caus'd by a Pa&s;&s;ion which would prove the greate&s;t Misfortunes of his whole Life. Finding him&s;elf then in this condition, and having not &s;trength to re&s;ist it, he re|&s;olv'd to u&s;e the utmost Extremity, and to fly and avoid a place where he was in danger of dying with Love, or breaking through the Bonds of Friend&s;hip. The most cruel Death wou'd have &s;eem gentler than the Execution of this De&s;ign: When the Marchione&s;s beginning to grow better, he went to her to bid her Adieu, and &s;ee her no more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He found her bu&s;ied in choo&s;ing among &s;everal Stones of great price, tho&s;e which were the fine&s;t, which &s;he intended to have &s;et in a Ring,</HI> Don Lewis <HI>was &s;carce entred the Chamber, but &s;he de&s;ired him, with that Air of Familiarity u&s;ual among Relations to go and fetch her other Stones which &s;he moreover had in her Cabinet. He ran thither, and by an unexpected good hap, found among what he lookt for, the Picture enamill'd of the Marchione&s;s, in little, &s;et with Diamonds, and incircled with a Lock of her Hair; it was &s;o like, that he had not the power to with&s;tand the de&s;ire he had of stealing it:</HI> I am going to leave her, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ee her no more; I &s;acrifice all my quiet to her Husband: Alas! is not this enough? And may I not without a Crime, &s;earch in my Pain a Con&s;olation &s;o innocent as this. <HI>He ki&s;t &s;everal times this Picture; he put it under his Arm, he carefully hid it, and returning towards her with the&s;e Stones, he trembling told her the Re&s;olution he had taken of Travelling. She appear'd much amazed at it, and chang'd her colour. He lookt on her at this moment; he had the plea&s;ure of perceiving it; and their Eyes being of Intelligence, &s;pake more than their Words:</HI> Alas! What can oblige you, <HI>Don Lewis, &s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> to leave us? Your Co&s;in loves you &s;o tenderly; I e&s;teem you; we are never pleas'd without you; he cannot live from you: Have you not already travelled? You have without doubt &s;ome other Rea&s;on for your Departure, but at lea&s;t do not hide it from me. Don Lewis, <HI>pierc'd through with &s;orrrow, could not forbear uttering a deep Sigh, and taking one of the delicate Hands of the Charming Per&s;on, on which he fixt his Mouth,</HI> Ah, Madam, what do you ask me? <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> What can I &s;ay to you? And indeed, What can I &s;ay to you, in the Condition I am in? <HI>The Violence he u&s;ed, to conceal his Sentiments, caus'd him &s;uch a great Weakne&s;s, that he fell half dead at her Feet. She remained troubled and confu&s;ed at this &s;ight: She oblig'd him to &s;it down by her; &s;he dared not lift up her Eyes to look on him; but &s;he let him &s;ee Tears, which &s;he could not for|bear &s;hedding, nor re&s;olve to conceal from him.</HI></P>
<PB N="25" REF="15">
<P><HI>Scarcely were they come to them&s;elves, when the Marque&s;s en|tred into the Chamber. He came to embrace</HI> Don Lewis <HI>with all the Testimonies of a perfect Friend&s;hip, and he was in the greate&s;t trouble, when he understood he parted for</HI> Naples. <HI>He omitted no Arguments to per&s;wade him from it, prest his &s;tay with the great|e&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, but all in vain. He there immediately took his leave of the Marchione&s;s, and &s;aw her no more. The Marque&s;s went out with him, he left him not till the moment of his De|parture. This was an Augmentation of</HI> Don Lewis<HI>'s Sorrow; he would have willingly remained alone to have an intire Liberty of afflicting him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Marchione&s;s was &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at this Separation: She had perceived he loved her, before he had known thus much him&s;elf; and &s;he had found in him &s;uch &s;ingular Merit, that for her part too &s;he had loved him without knowing it; but &s;he found this to her Co&s;t after his Departure: Recovering but lately from a dangerous Sickne&s;s, of which &s;he was not perfectly cured, this unhappy Acci|dent made her fall into a langui&s;hing Indi&s;po&s;ition, as &s;oon rendred her quite another body; her Duty, her Rea&s;on, her Vertue equally per&s;ecuted her: She was greatly &s;en&s;ible of her Husband's Re&s;pects to her, and &s;he could not &s;uffer but with great Sorrow, that ano|ther &s;hould take up her thoughts, and have &s;o great a place in her Affections. She dared not any more mention the Name of</HI> Don Lewis; <HI>&s;he never made any Inquiries after him; &s;he made it an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to forget him: This Violence which &s;he u&s;ed on her &s;elf, was like a continual Martyrdom; &s;he made one of her Wo|men, in whom &s;he most confided, the Repo&s;itory of this Secret:</HI> Am I not very unhappy? <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I mu&s;t wi&s;h never again to &s;ee a Man, towards whom it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to be in a &s;tate of Indifference; his Per&s;on is always before mine Eyes; nay, I think &s;ometimes I &s;ee him in the Per&s;on of my Husband; the Re&s;emblance which is between them, &s;erves only to nouri&s;h my Affection towards him. Alas! <HI>Mariana,</HI> I mu&s;t die, to expi|ate this Crime, although it be an involuntary one: I have on|ly this means to get rid of a Pa&s;&s;ion of which I cannot hither|to be Mi&s;tre&s;s: Alas, what have I not done to &s;tifle it, this Pa&s;&s;ion which yet is dear to me. <HI>She accompany'd the&s;e Words with a thou&s;and Sighs: She melted into Tears, and though this Woman had a great deal of Wit and Affection to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;he could &s;ay nothing to her could yield her any Comfort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Marque&s;s in the mean time, every day reproacht his Wife with her Indifferency to</HI> Don Lewis: I cannot &s;uffer, <HI>&s;aid be to her,</HI> that you &s;hould think &s;o little on the Man I love above all the World, and who had &s;o much Complai&s;ance and Friend|&s;hip

What good would my remem|bring him do him? <HI>&s;aid the Marchione&s;s with a langui&s;hing Air,</HI> Do not you &s;ee he avoids us?

<P><HI>She would have retir'd; but he took this opportunity to oblige her to do what he would have her; he told her very &s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> That he could no longer bear the Ab&s;ence of his Co&s;in; that he was re&s;olv'd to go find him; that 'twas already two Years &s;ince he had been gone, without intimating any de&s;ire of returning to his Friends and Country; that he was per&s;waded he would yield a greater Deference to her Reque&s;ts than his; that he con|jured her to write to him: And that in fine, &s;he might chu&s;e either to give him this Satisfaction, or be content to &s;ee him, part for <HI>Naples,</HI> where <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was to make &s;ome &s;tay. <HI>She remain'd &s;urpriz'd, and perplext at this Propo&s;al; but knowing he expected with great Impatience her Determination,</HI> What would you have me &s;ay to him, my Lord? <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him with a &s;or|rowful Countenance,</HI> Dictate this Letter to me, I will write it; I can do no more; and I believe this is more than I ought <HI>The Marque&s;s, tran&s;ported with Joy, mo&s;t affectionately embrac'd her; he thank'd her for her Compliance, and made her write the&s;e Words:</HI></P>

Although he had remarkt Di&s;po&s;itions of Tenderne&s;s in the Coun|tenance of this fair Per&s;on, yet he dared not promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;he could de&s;ire his Return; his Rea&s;on revolted again&s;t his Joy:</HI> How Unhappy a Wretch am I? <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I Adore the mo&s;t Amiable of all Women, and yet I dare not offer to plea&s;e her! &s;he has a Kindne&s;s for me, yet Honour and Friend&s;hip with-hold me from making the lea&s;t Advantage of it. What &s;hall I do then, O Heavens! What &s;hall I do! I flatter'd my &s;elf, that Ab&s;ence would Cure me: Alas! this is a Remedy which I have fruit|le&s;ly tried; I have never ca&s;t mine Eyes on her Picture, but have found my &s;elf more in Love, and more Mi&s;erable than when I &s;aw her every day. I mu&s;t obey her, &s;he commands my Return; &s;he de&s;ires to &s;ee me, and &s;he cannot be ignorant of my Pa&s;&s;ion: When I took my Leave of her, my Eyes decla|red to her the Secret of my Heart: And when I call to mind what I &s;aw in hers, all my Reflections then are to no purpo&s;e; for I re&s;olve rather to die at her Feet, than to live remote from her.</P>
<P><HI>He parted without any delay, and without taking leave of his Friends. He left a Gentleman to Excu&s;e him towards them, and to order his Affairs. He was in &s;uch great ha&s;te to &s;ee the Mar|chione&s;s, that he u&s;ed &s;uch Diligence to be with her, that no body but he could have done: In arriving at</HI> Cagliary, <HI>Capital of</HI> Sar|dagne, <HI>he under&s;tood that the Marque&s;s and his Wife were at a &s;tately Country-hou&s;e, where the Vice-Roy was gone to give them a Vi&s;it, with all his Court. He learnt moreover, that the Mar|que&s;s de</HI> Barbaran <HI>prepared for him a great Fea&s;t, where there were to be held Ju&s;ts or Turnaments, after the Ancient Manner of the</HI> Mores: <HI>He was the Defendant, and was to maintain,</HI> That a Husband beloved, is Happier than a Lover.</P>
<P><HI>Several Gentlemen that were not of this Opinion, were prepa|ring them&s;elves to go and di&s;pute the Prize, which the Marchione&s;s, at the Vice-Queen's Intreaty, was to give to the Conquerour; 'Twas a Scarf embroidered with her own Hands, wrought with Cyphers: No one was to appear but maskt and di&s;gui&s;ed, to the end all might be freer and more gallant.</HI></P>
<P>Don Lewis <HI>had a &s;ecret De&s;pight, in comprehending the Mar|que&s;s &s;o well &s;atisfied:</HI> He is belov'd, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I cannot but look on him as my Rival, and as an Happy Rival; but we mu&s;t en|deavour to di&s;turb his Happine&s;s, in triumphing over his vain Glory. <HI>Having formed this De&s;ign, he would not appear in Town: he caus'd to be made a Suit of &s;trip'd Green Satin, embroidered with Gold, and all his Liveries were of the &s;ame Colour, to de|note his new hopes.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="17">
<P><HI>When he entred into the Li&s;ts, every body had their Eyes on him; his Magnificence and his Air gave Emulation to the Cava|liers, and great Curio&s;ities to the Ladies. The Marchione&s;s felt a &s;ecret Emotion, of which &s;he could not di&s;cover the Cau&s;e: He was placed very near the Balcony, where &s;he &s;ate with the Vice-Queen; but there was no Lady there which did not lo&s;e all her Lu&s;tre near that of the Marchione&s;s; her youthful Air, which ex|ceeded not eighteen Years, her lovely white and red Cheeks, her Eyes &s;o &s;weet and graceful, her Scarlet and little Mouth, agreea|ble Smiles, and her Shape, which &s;urpa&s;t the Fairest, made her the Admiration of all the World.</HI></P>
<P>Don Lewis <HI>was &s;o ravi&s;h'd in &s;eeing her &s;o charming, and to ob|&s;erve yet in her Countenance a langui&s;hing &s;orrowful Air, that he flattered him&s;elf to have therein a part; and this was the fir&s;t Moment wherein he thought him&s;elf Happy. When his turn came, he ran against the Marque&s;s, and &s;mote him &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that he got the Advantage all along of him: &s;o that in a word, he gain'd the Prize with a general Applau&s;e, and with every one's good-liking. He threw him&s;elf at the Marchione&s;s's Feet, to re|ceive it at her Hands; he altered the Tone of his Voice, and &s;peak|ing to her with his Mask on, low enough not to be heard but only by her:</HI> Divine Per&s;on, <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> be pleas'd to ob&s;erve what Fortune decides in favour of Lovers. <HI>He dar'd not &s;ay more to her; and without knowing him, &s;he gave him the Prize, with this natural Grace with which all her Actions were accompani|ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf, for fear of being known; for this might have been an occa&s;ion of Quarrel between the Marque&s;s and him; and without doubt he would not have ea&s;ily pardon'd the Victory he obtain'd over him. This oblig'd, him to keep him&s;elf &s;till conceal'd for &s;ome Days. The Voice-Roy and his Lady return'd to</HI> Cagliary, <HI>and the Marque&s;s and Marchione&s;s accompanied them thither, with the whole Court.</HI></P>
<P>Don Lewis <HI>then &s;hew'd him&s;elf; he pretended he ju&s;t then ar|riv'd, and made as if he knew not what had past in the Field. The Marque&s;s</HI> de Barbaran <HI>was tran&s;ported with Joy in &s;eeing him; and Ab&s;ence had not at all altered the Affection he had for this dear Relation. He had no difficult task to find a favoura|ble moment wherein to entertain his amiable Marchione&s;s; he had as much liberty in their Lodgings as in his own; and you may well judge, Madam, that he forgot not to mention the Prize he had receiv'd from her fair Hands:</HI> How wretched am I, <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> that you did not know me? Alas, Madam, I flattered my &s;elf, that by &s;ome &s;ecret Pre-&s;entiments you would learn,

I &s;hall die with Regret, Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Don Lewis, if I have di&s;pleas'd you in what I have done; and were you more favourably di&s;po&s;ed, and I might dare to make you my Confident, it would be no hard matter for me to per&s;wade you, that it is not at <HI>Naples</HI> I have left the Object of my Vows.</P>
<P><HI>The Marchione&s;s apprehending le&s;t he &s;hould &s;peak more than &s;he was willing to hear, and appear livelily toucht with the Reproach &s;he made him, &s;he put on a more plea&s;ing Countenance, and turn|ing the Conver&s;ation into a Tone of Raillery, an&s;wer'd him,</HI> He took too &s;eriou&s;ly what &s;he had &s;aid to him. <HI>He dared not make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to declare his Love to her; for though he lov'd her above all things, yet he re&s;pected her no le&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When he had left her, he began to blame him&s;elf for his Fearful|ne&s;s:</HI> Shall I, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> always &s;uffer without &s;eeking any Re|medy! <HI>It was &s;ome time before he could meet with a favourable occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the Marchione&s;s studiou&s;ly avoided him; but being come one Night where &s;he was, he found her alone in an inward Room, lying on a Bed in a most lovely manner, and mo&s;t becoming &V;ndre&s;s, her Hair being fa&s;tned with Knots of Diamonds, hung carele&s;ly about her Brea&s;ts: The Trouble &s;he felt in &s;eeing</HI> Don Lewis, <HI>appear'd on her Countenance, and rendred her yet more lovely: He drew near her with an Awful and re&s;pectful Air, fell down on his Knees by her; he lookt on her for &s;ome time, not daring to &s;peak but becoming a little more bold,</HI> If you con&s;ider, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> the pitious Condition whereunto you have re|duced me, you will ea&s;ily comprehend that it is no longer in my power to keep Silence: I could not avoid &s;uch inevitable Stroaks as you have given me; I have adored you as &s;oon as I &s;aw you: I have endeavour'd to Cure my &s;elf in flying from you; I have offered the greate&s;t Violence to my &s;elf, in en|deavouring to ma&s;ter my Pa&s;&s;ion.

What do you then, Ma|dam, <HI>an&s;wer'd he, interrupting her, being full of Grief and De&s;pair,</HI> when you pronounce the Sentence of my Death? You cannot Hate, me &s;ay you: Do you not Hate me, and do you not do me all the Mi&s;chief you are able, when you re&s;olve to avoid me? Make an end, Madam, make an end, leave not your Venge|ance imperfect; &s;acrifice me to your Duty, and your Husband; for my Life cannot but be odious, if you take from me the Hopes of plea&s;ing you. <HI>She lookt on him at this in&s;tant with Eyes full of Langui&s;hing: Don Lewis, &s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> you re|proach me with what I would de&s;erve. <HI>In ending the&s;e words, &s;he aro&s;e, fearing greatly, le&s;t her Affection &s;hould triumph over her Rea&s;on; and notwith&s;tanding his endeavours to with-hold her, &s;he pa&s;t into a Chamber where her Women were.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She thought &s;he had gained much on her &s;elf in forcing her way out of this Conver&s;ation, without an&s;wering &s;o favourably as her Heart could have wi&s;ht; but Love is a Seducer, which mu&s;t not be in any &s;ort hearkened to, if one will not be totally overcome by him. From that day</HI> Don Lewis <HI>began to think him&s;elf Hap|py, though he wanted many things to compleat his Felicity. The Marchione&s;s, in effect, had a Principle of Vertue, which oppo&s;ed it &s;elf always with Succe&s;s to the de&s;ires of her Lover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He had no longer tho&s;e Scruples of Friend&s;hip for the Marque&s;s</HI> de Barbaran <HI>which had &s;o greatly disturbed his Mind; Love had perfectly bani&s;ht Friend&s;hip; nay, he even &s;ecretly hated him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> Don Lewis <HI>flattering him&s;elf, that perhaps he might find a favourable moment to affect the Marchione&s;s's Heart with &s;ome Pity; he carefully &s;ought it; and to find it, one day when 'twas very hot, knowing that the Marchione&s;s was wont to retire to Repo&s;e her &s;elf after Dinner, as it is cu&s;tomary, in that Coun|try, he came to her, doubting not but every body was a&s;leep in the Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She was in a Ground-Room which lookt into the Garden; all was fa&s;t and &s;hut clo&s;e, &s;ave a little Window, whereby he &s;aw on her Bed

She aro&s;e on a &s;udden; &s;he had not her Eyes open; the Chamber was dark, and &s;he could never have believ'd</HI> Don Lewis <HI>could have been &s;o bold. I have already told you, Madam, that he re&s;embled the Marque&s;s</HI> de Barbaran; <HI>She did not doubt then but it was he, and calling him &s;everal times,</HI> her dear Marque&s;s and Husband <HI>&s;he tenderly embrac'd him. He well knew his Error; whatever Plea&s;ure it procured him, he could have wi&s;hed to have ow'd this only to his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Favours. But, O Heavens, how unfortu|nately it hapned! The Marque&s;s came in this dangerous moment; and 'twas not without the greatest fury he &s;aw the Liberty</HI> Don Lewis <HI>took with his Wife.

<P>Don Lewis <HI>amaz'd at this Accident, flatter'd him&s;elf, that per|haps he was not known: He pa&s;t immediately into the Gallery, and finding a Window was opened into the Garden, he threw him&s;elf out of it, and immediately pa&s;t through a Back-door. The Mar|que&s;s pur&s;ued him, without being able to overtake him: In return|ing the &s;ame way he came, he unhappily found the Marchione&s;s's Picture. which</HI> Don Lewis <HI>had dropt as he ran; he immediately made mo&s;t cruel Reflections hereupon: This Picture of his Wife, which</HI> Don Lewis <HI>had let fall, and the &s;ight of her embracing him, all this made him no longer doubt of his Wives Fal&s;hood:</HI> I am be|tray'd, <HI>Cry'd he,</HI> by her whom I loved dearer than my own Life: Was there ever a more Unhappy Man in the World? <HI>In ending the&s;e Words, he returned to his Wives Chamber. She im|mediately threw her &s;elf at his Feet, and melting into Tears, would have ju&s;tify'd her &s;elf, and make known to him her Innocency; but the Spirit of Jealou&s;ie had &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;t him, that he vio|lently represt her: He harkned only to the Tran&s;ports of his Rage and De&s;pair, and turning away his Eyes, that he might not &s;ee &s;o lovely an Object, he had the Barbarity to strike his Dagger into the Breast of the mo&s;t Beautiful and most Vertuous Woman in the World. She offered her &s;elf to be &s;laughtered as an innocent Sacri|fice, and her Soul i&s;&s;ued out in a &s;tream of Blood.</HI></P>

<P><HI>And it is he him&s;elf that has related to one of my Friends the Particularities of his Crime; and he is &s;o furiou&s;ly tortured with the remembrance of it, that he imagines he continually &s;ees his Wife dying, and reproaching him with his Fury and Jealou&s;ie. In a word, he has contracted &s;uch a deep Melancholy, that his Death is thought by every one to be near, or at the lea&s;t, the lo&s;s of his Sences.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman here was &s;ilent; and I not being able to forbear weeping at &s;o Tragical a Relation, <HI>Don Fernand de To|ledo,</HI> who had ob&s;erv'd it, and would not take notice of it, for fear of interrupting the Relation, rally'd me about my Ten|derne&s;s, telling me how well he was plea&s;ed to find me &s;o Com|pa&s;&s;ionate, and that I &s;hould not be long before I met with Ob|jects fit to exerci&s;e it on. I did not &s;o much mind the return|ing an An&s;wer to him, as the Thanking this Gentleman, who was pleas'd to entertain me with the Recital of &s;o extraordinary an Adventure: I intreated him to make my Compliments to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> and to give him from me two Pi&s;tols, &s;eeing he lived on Alms. <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and each of the Cavaliers, gave as much: <HI>Here is,</HI> &s;aid the Gentleman to us, <HI>wherewith to enrich the Poor of</HI> Victoria; <HI>for</HI> Don Lewis <HI>appropriates not &s;uch great Charities as the&s;e to him&s;elf.</HI> We told him, he was the Ma&s;ter, and might di&s;po&s;e of the Money as he plea&s;ed. But to re|turn to my Adventures:</P>
<P>Although I had a Pa&s;port from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the be&s;t &s;pecified, and mo&s;t general, as is po&s;&s;ible, yet I was oblig'd to
<PB N="34" REF="20"> take a Billet from the Toll-Hou&s;e; for without this Precaution, all my Cloaths had been confi&s;cated: <HI>To what purpo&s;e then is my Pa&s;port?</HI> &s;aid I to them. <HI>To none at all,</HI> replied they. The Surveyers and Officers of the Cu&s;toms would not &s;o much as ca&s;t their Eyes on it; they told me, The King mu&s;t come and a&s;&s;ure them, that this Order was from him. It is to no purpo&s;e for any one to alledge his being a Stranger, and igno|rant of the U&s;ages of the Country: For they drily an&s;wer, <HI>That the Stranger's Ignorance makes the</HI> Spaniard<HI>'s Profit.</HI> The ill weather has kept me here two Days, during which I &s;aw the Governe&s;s, and the Play. The principal Place of this Town is adorn'd with a very fair Fountain &s;tanding in the mid&s;t: it is incircled with the Town-Hou&s;e, the Pri&s;on, two Convents, and &s;everal well-built Hou&s;es: Here is a New Town and an Old one; every body for&s;akes this latter to dwell in the other. Here are very rich Merchants; their chief Trade is at St. <HI>Se|ba&s;tian</HI> or <HI>Bilbo;</HI> they &s;end great &s;tore of Iron to <HI>Grenada, Estre|madour, Galicia,</HI> and other Parts of the Kingdom. I ob&s;erv'd, that the great Streets are &s;et with fine Trees, which are water|ed with Streams running by them. From <HI>Mount St. Adrian</HI> hither, it is &s;even Leagues. In fine, I am ju&s;t &s;etting out, and mu&s;t end this long Letter; it is late, and I have &s;poke, to you &s;o much of what I have &s;een, that I have &s;aid nothing of my Affections to you: Believe me, however, Dear Co&s;in, that I am, and ever &s;hall be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>MY Letters are &s;o long, that it is hard to believe when I fini&s;h them, that I have any thing el&s;e more to tell you; yet, my dear Co&s;in, I never clo&s;e any, but there remains &s;till &s;ufficient for another: When I were only to &s;peak to you of my Friend&s;hip, this would be an inexhau&s;tible Subject; you may make &s;ome Judgment of it from the Plea&s;ure I find in obey|ing your Commands. You are de&s;irous to know all the Particu|lars of my Voyage, I will therefore go on to relate them:</P>
<P>I &s;et out very late from <HI>Victoria,</HI> by rea&s;on of my &s;tay at the Governe&s;s's, whom I before mention'd: and we went to lie at
<PB N="35" REF="20"> <HI>Miranda;</HI> the Country is very plea&s;ant as far as <HI>Avigny;</HI> we came afterwerds by a difficult Way to the Banks of the River <HI>&V;rola,</HI> who&s;e. Noi&s;e is the greater, in that 'tis full of Rocks, on which the Water da&s;hes, beats up, and falls down, and forms natural Ca&s;cades in &s;everal places: We continu'd to a&s;|cend the high Mountains of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> where we ran a thou|&s;and &s;everal Dangers: we &s;aw the ancient Ruines of an old Ca&s;tle, where Gho&s;ts and Spirits have their Apartments, as well as in that of <HI>Quebara,</HI> it is near <HI>Garga&s;on;</HI> and being to &s;top there to &s;hew my Pa&s;port, becau&s;e here certain Cu&s;toms are paid to the King, I learnt from the Alcade of the Borough, who drew near my Litter to talk with me, that it is the com|mon Report of the Country, That there were formerly a King and a Queen here, who had &s;o fine and beautiful a Woman to their Daughter, that &s;he was rather taken for a Goodne&s;s than a Mortal Creature: &s;he was call'd <HI>Mira;</HI> and it is from her Name came the <HI>Mira</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Look you;</HI> for as &s;oon as ever &s;he appear'd, all the People attentively beheld her; and cried out, <HI>Mira, Mira;</HI> and here's the Etymo|logy of a Word drawn far enough. This Prince&s;s was never &s;een by any Body who became not de&s;perately in love with her; but her Di&s;dainfulne&s;s and Indifference made all her Lovers pine away: The famous Ba&s;ilisk never kill'd &s;o many People as the Beautiful and Dreadful <HI>Mira;</HI> &s;he thus depopulated her Fa|ther's Kingdom, and all the Countries thereabouts were full of the decea&s;ed and dying Lovers. After they had in vain Ad|dre&s;t them&s;elves to her, they la&s;tly applied them&s;elves to Hea|ven, to demand Vengeance on her Cruelty: The Gods at length grew Angry, and the Godde&s;&s;es were not much behind them in the Exerci&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;ion: &s;o that to puni&s;h her, the Scourges of Heaven fini&s;h'd the De&s;truction of her Father's Kingdom: In this general Calamity he con&s;ulted the Oracle, which told him, <HI>That all the&s;e Mi&s;eries would not have an end, till</HI> Maria <HI>had expiated the Mi&s;chiefs which her Eyes had done: and that &s;he mu&s;t be gone: That De&s;tiny would conduct her to the place where &s;he was to lo&s;e her repo&s;e and liberty.</HI> The Prince&s;s obey'd, believing it impo&s;&s;ible for her to be touch'd with Tenderne&s;s: She carried only her Nur&s;e with her; &s;he was clad like a &s;imple Shepherde&s;s, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be taken notice of, whether at Sea or Land. She ran over a great Part of the World, committing every day two or three Dozen of Mur|thers; for her Beauty was not dimini&s;ht by the Fatigue of her Travels: She arriv'd at length near this old Ca&s;tle, which be|long'd to a young Count, call'd <HI>Nios,</HI> endowed with a thou&s;and
<PB N="36" REF="21"> Perfections, but extream Proud and Re&s;erv'd: he &s;pent his time in the Woods; as &s;oon as ever he perceiv'd a Woman, he fled from her, and of all things he &s;aw in the World, &s;he was his greate&s;t Aver&s;ion. The beautiful <HI>Mira</HI> was re&s;ting her &s;elf one day under the &s;hade of &s;ome Trees, when <HI>Nios</HI> pa&s;t by, cloathed with a Lyon's Skin, a Bow at his Girdle, and a Mace on his Shoulder; his Hair was all clotted together, and his Face be &s;mear'd like a Chimney-Sweeper's, (this Circum|&s;tance is ob&s;ervable) yet the Prince&s;s thought him the mo&s;t hand&s;ome Man in the World; &s;he ran after him as if &s;he had been mad; and he ran from her as if he had been in the &s;ame condition: &s;he lo&s;t the &s;ight of him; &s;he knew not where to find him: &s;he is now in the greata&s;t Sorrow, weeping Day and Night with her Nur&s;e. <HI>Nios</HI> return'd to the Cha&s;e; &s;he &s;aw him again, and would have follow'd him: as &s;oon as he per|ceiv'd her, he did as at fir&s;t, and <HI>Mira</HI> betook her &s;elf again to her Lamentations; but her Pa&s;&s;ion giving her new &s;trength, &s;he out-ran him, &s;topt him, taking hold of his Locks, intreat|ing him to look on her, thinking this was enough to engage him: He ca&s;t his Eyes on her with as much Indifference as if &s;he had been an ordinary Per&s;on. Never Woman was more &s;urpriz'd; &s;he would not leave him; &s;he came maugre him to his Ca&s;tle: where, as &s;oon as &s;he had entred, he there left her, and was no more &s;een. The poor <HI>Mira,</HI> being not to be comforted, died with Grief, And from that time you hear deep Sighs and Groans, which come from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nios.</HI> The young Wenches of the Country are u&s;ed to go there, and carry her little Pre&s;ents of Fruits and Milk, which they &s;et down at the Mouth of a Cave, where no body dare enter: they &s;aid, this was to comfort her; but this has been aboli&s;ht as &s;uper&s;titious. And though I believed not a word of whate|ever was told me at <HI>Gargan&s;on,</HI> in relation to <HI>Mira</HI> and <HI>Nios,</HI> yet I was pleas'd in the Recital of this Story, of which I omit a thou&s;and Particulars, for fear of tiring you by its length. My Waiting-woman was &s;o affected with this Relation, that &s;he was for having us return back again, to &s;et at the Mouth of the Cave &s;ome red Partridges, which my People had brought: &s;he imagin'd the Prince&s;s's Gho&s;t would be mightily comfort|ed in receiving this Te&s;timony of our good Will; but for my part, I thought I &s;hould be more content than her, in having tho&s;e Partridges for my Supper. We pa&s;t the River of <HI>&V;rola,</HI> on a great &s;tone-Bridge, and having went over another, with difficulty enough, by rea&s;on of the melted Snow, we arriv'd at <HI>Miranda d' Ebro;</HI> this is a great Village, or a little Town:
<PB N="37" REF="21"> here is a large place adorn'd with a Fountain; the River <HI>Ebro,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of <HI>Spain,</HI> traver&s;es it: You &s;ee on the Top of a Mountain the Ca&s;tle, with &s;everal Towers; it appears to be of &s;ome &s;trength; and there i&s;&s;ues out &s;o great a Stream from a Rock on which it is built, that it turns &s;everal Mills: I could not ob&s;erve any thing el&s;e worth writing to you.</P>
<P>The three Knights I &s;pake of to you, were arriv'd before me, and giv'n all requi&s;ite Orders for Supper; &s;o we eat to|gether: And tho' the Night appear'd well advanced, becau&s;e the Days are &s;hort in this Sea&s;on, yet 'twas not late; &s;o that the&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;hew'd me great Re&s;pect and Civility, askt me, How I would pa&s;s the time? I propo&s;ed to them the playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and that I would go Halves with <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo.</HI> They accepted the Offer: <HI>Don Fernand de Cardonne</HI> &s;aid, He had rather Conver&s;e with me than Play: &s;o the three others began, and I for &s;ome time gave my &s;elf over to the looking on them, with great Plea&s;ure, for their Way is quite different from ours: They never utter a word; I do not &s;ay, to complain, (for this would be unworthy the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity) but to demand a <HI>Gano,</HI> or to cut higher, or to &s;hew that one may take &s;ome other Advantage: In a word, they &s;eem to be Statues, or Pieces of <HI>German</HI> Clock-work, never appearing tran&s;ported with either good or bad Luck. Among other Di&s;cour&s;e which I had with <HI>D. Fred. de Cardonne,</HI> he told me, There were two ob&s;ervable things in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> one of which is a Mountain of Salt, partly white as Snow, and the other part clearer and more tran&s;parent than Cry&s;tal: that there is Blue, Green, Violet, Orange, and a thou&s;and different Colours, which yet lo&s;es its tincture when wetted; it continually forms it &s;elf, and grows there: and though commonly the places where Salt is to be found, are &s;o barren, that you &s;ee not &s;o much as an Herb, yet there are here Pine-Trees of great height, and excellent Vine-yards: When the Sun darts its Rays on this Mountain, it looks as if it wholly con&s;i&s;ted of the mo&s;t preci|ous Stones in the World: but the be&s;t of it is, that it yields a good Revenue.</P>
<P>The other Particular he mentioned to me, was of a Foun|tain, who&s;e Water is very good, and of the &s;ame Colour as Claret: <HI>I have never heard any thing of this,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>but one of my Relations, who has been in</HI> Catalonia, <HI>has a&s;&s;ured me there is a Fountain near</HI> Balut, <HI>who&s;e Water is as others are for Colour, and yet whatever you put therein, appears like Gold. I have &s;een it, Madam,</HI> continued <HI>Don Frederic; and I remember
<PB N="38" REF="22"> a Man that was very covetous, and more fooli&s;h, went thither every Day to put therein his Silver, hoping in time 'twould be chang'd into Gold: but he was &s;o far from enriching him&s;elf that he was ruin'd; for &s;ome Pea&s;ants, more &s;ubtle and crafty than he, having perceived what he did, &s;tood watching a little lower, and the Stream of the Water would now and then bring &s;ome Pieces to them. If you return into</HI> France <HI>by</HI> Catalonia, added he, <HI>you will &s;ee this Fountain, It is not that which can draw me thither,</HI> reply'd I, <HI>but the de&s;ire of pa&s;&s;ing by</HI> Montferat, <HI>wou'd make me undertake a longer Journey. It is &s;ituated,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>near</HI> Barcelona, <HI>and is a place of great Devotion: It &s;eems as if the Rock were &s;awed through the middle; the Church &s;tands high, is &s;mall and ob&s;cure. By the help of Four&s;core and Ten Lamps of Silver, you perceive the Image of the Virgin, which looks very duski&s;h, and is held for Miraculous. The Altar co&s;t</HI> Philip <HI>the Second thirty thou&s;and Crowns; and here is every Day &s;een Pilgrims from all Parts of the World; this Holy Place abounds with Her|mitages, inhabited by Per&s;ons of great Devotion: The&s;e are com|monly Men of good Birth, who have not left the World till they have well tryed it, and who appear much taken with the Sweets of their Retirements, though the Place be di&s;mal; and 'twould been impo&s;&s;ible to have had Acce&s;s to it, had not a Pa&s;&s;age been cut through the Rocks. Yet you find here &s;everal agreeable Objects, a curious Pro&s;pect, various Springs, Gardens well dre&s;t by the&s;e Religio&s;es own hands, and every where a certain Air of Solitude and Devotion, which mightily affects tho&s;e who come there. We have another famous place of Devotion,</HI> added he, <HI>and that is</HI> Nue&s;tra Senora del Pilar: <HI>it is at</HI> Sarago&s;&s;a, <HI>in a Chappel on a Pillar of Marble, where our Lady holds the Babe Je&s;us in her Arms. It is pretended, that the Virgin appeared on this &s;ame Pil|lar to St.</HI> James; <HI>and the Image is here wor&s;hipt with great Reve|rence. It cannot be well ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e it &s;tands &s;o high, and in a very dark place; &s;o that without the Flambeaux it could not be &s;een at all. Here are always Fifty Lamps burning; Gold and precious Stones &s;hine here on all &s;ides; and the Pilgrims come here in great Sholes. But yet,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I may truly &s;ay, in favour of</HI> Sarago&s;&s;a <HI>that 'tis one of the fine&s;t Towns you &s;hall &s;ee; it is &s;itua|ted along the</HI> Ebre, <HI>in a va&s;t Field, is adorn'd with great Build|ings, rich Churches, a &s;tately Bridge, fine open Places, and the mo&s;t charming Women in the World, who love</HI> French, <HI>and will omit nothing to oblige you to &s;peak well of 'em, if you pa&s;s by there.</HI> I told him, I had already heard &s;everal things &s;poken of them to their commendation: <HI>But</HI> continu'd I, <HI>this Country is very Barren, and the Souldiers can hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t in it. In effect,</HI> re|plied
<PB N="39" REF="22"> he, <HI>whether the Air be bad, or that they want Nece&s;&s;aries, the</HI> Flemmings <HI>and</HI> Germans <HI>cannot live there? and if they do not die there, 'tis becau&s;e they run away. The</HI> Spaniards <HI>and</HI> Neopolitans <HI>are more prone than they to de&s;ert; the&s;e la&s;t pa&s;t through</HI> France, <HI>to return into their Country; the others Coast the</HI> Pyrences <HI>along</HI> Languedoc, <HI>and enter</HI> Ca&s;tille <HI>by</HI> Navarre, <HI>or</HI> Bi&s;caye. <HI>This is a Cour&s;e which the old Souldiers fail not to &s;teer; for the new-rais'd ones, they peri&s;h in</HI> Catalonia, <HI>being not accu&s;tomed there|to; and 'tis certain there's no place where War is more trouble|&s;ome to the King of</HI> Spain: <HI>He maintains his Forces here with great Charge, and the Advantage which the Enemy gains of him is not &s;mall; and I very well know they are more &s;en&s;ible at</HI> Ma|drid <HI>for the &s;malle&s;t Lo&s;s in</HI> Catalonia, <HI>than they would be for the greate&s;t in</HI> Flanders, <HI>or</HI> Milan, <HI>or el&s;e-where. But at pre&s;ent,</HI> continues he, <HI>we are going to be more at our Ea&s;e than we have been, being expected at Court, that the Peace will be la&s;ting, becau&s;e they talk much of a Marriage which will make a new Al|liance; and the Marque&s;s</HI> de Los Balbares, <HI>Penipotentiary at</HI> Nimiguen, <HI>has receiv'd Orders to pa&s;s &s;peedily to</HI> France, <HI>to de|mand of that King,</HI> Mademoi&s;elle d' Orleans; <HI>therefore it is not doubted but the Marriage will be concluded: But it is thought very strange,</HI> Don John <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria <HI>&s;hould con&s;ent to this Marri|age. You will do me a &s;ingular Plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;aid I, interrupting him, <HI>if you would inform me of &s;ome Particularities touching this Prince: It is natural for to have a Curio&s;ity in relation to Per&s;ons of this Character; and when a body comes into a Court where one was never before, that I may not appear a Novice, I &s;hould have &s;ome previous Notices.</HI> He an&s;wered me, It would be a great &s;atisfaction to him, if he could relate any thing might plea&s;e me; and he began thus:</P>
<P><HI>You will not, perhaps, Madam, think it ami&s;s, that I begin at the Original of Things, and tell you, That this Prince was Son of one of the fine&s;t Women in</HI> Spain, <HI>named</HI> Maria Calderona; <HI>&s;he was a Player; and the Duke</HI> de Medina de las Torres, <HI>became de&s;pe|rately in love with her: This Cavalier had &s;o many Advantages above others, that</HI> Calderonna <HI>lov'd him no le&s;s than &s;he was beloved by him. In the Heat of this Intrigue,</HI> Philip <HI>the Fourth &s;aw her, and preferr'd her to one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, and who was &s;o griev'd at this Change of the King, whom &s;he really loved, and had a Son by, that &s;he retired from the World, and betook her &s;elf to</HI> Los del Cal&s;as Reales, <HI>where &s;he put on the Religio's Habit. As for</HI> Calderonne, <HI>her inclination lying wholly towards the Duke</HI> de Medina, <HI>&s;he would not hearken to the King, without the Duke would thereto con&s;ent: She &s;pake to him of it,
<PB N="40" REF="23"> and offered to withdraw &s;ecretly where he would; but the Duke fearing to incur the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure, an&s;wer'd her, He was re|&s;olv'd to yield up to His Maje&s;ty a Trea&s;ure which he was not in a Capacity to contend for. She made him a thou&s;and Reproaches for this; &s;he call'd him Traytor to his Love, ingrateful towards his Mi&s;tre&s;s: And more-over, told him, That though he was &s;o Happy as that he could di&s;po&s;e of his Heart as he plea&s;ed, yet &s;he could not do the &s;ame; and therefore he mu&s;t continue to vi&s;it her, or prepare to &s;ee her die with De&s;pair. The Duke affected with &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed to feign a Journey to</HI> Andalou&s;ia, <HI>and to remain with her hid in a Clo&s;et: he effectually parted from the Court, and afterwards &s;hut him&s;elf up (as it was agreed) what|ever Ri&s;que he ran by &s;o imprudent Conduct. The King, in the mean time, was very Amorous, and remain'd very well &s;atisfi'd: She had, during this,</HI> Don John d' Au&s;tria, <HI>and the Re&s;emblance he had with the Duke</HI> de Medina de Las Torres, <HI>had made it be thought that he was his Son; but tho' the King had other Chil|dren, and particularly the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Malaga, <HI>good Fortune decided in his Favour, and he has been only acknowledg'd.</HI></P>
<P>Don John<HI>'s Friends &s;ay, That 'twas by rea&s;on of the Exchange which had been made of the Son of</HI> Calderonna, <HI>for the Son of Queen</HI> Elizabeth; <HI>and here's how they &s;et forth this Change, which is a Story made on purpo&s;e to impo&s;e on the World, and which I believe has no ground of Truth: They pretend, the King being de&s;perately in love with this Player, &s;he became big with Child at the &s;ame time as the Queen; and &s;eeing the King's Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o greatly towards her, that &s;he might expect any thing, &s;he &s;o order|ed it, that &s;he made him promi&s;e her, That if the Queen had a Son, and &s;he likewi&s;e, he &s;hould put hers in his place:</HI> What will you lo&s;e by this, Sir? <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Will it not be your Son that will &s;till Reign, only with this difference, that loving me, as you &s;ay you do, you will love him likewi&s;e the better. <HI>She had Wit, and the King could deny her nothing; he con&s;ented, and in effect the Bu&s;ine&s;s was manag'd with that Addre&s;s, that the Queen being brought to Bed of a Son, and</HI> Calderonna <HI>of another, the Exchange was made. He that &s;hould have Reign'd, and who bore the Name of</HI> Baltazar, <HI>died at the Age of fourteen Years: The King was told, 'twas with over-heating him&s;elf at Tennis; but the truth is, this Prince was &s;uffered to keep bad Company, which procured him his Misfortunes; it is &s;aid likewi&s;e, That</HI> Don Pedro d' Arragon, <HI>his Governour, and Chief Gentleman of his Chamber, more contributed to this than any other, &s;uffering him to bring into his Apartment a Woman he lov'd; after this he was taken with a violent Feaver, and conceal'd the Occa&s;ion: The
<PB N="41" REF="23"> Phy&s;icians, who were ignorant of it, thought to ea&s;e him by frequent Bleedings, which put an end to what &s;trength he had; and by this means they ended his Life. The King knowing, but too late, what had hapn'd, bani&s;ht</HI> Don Pedro <HI>for not hindring this Exce&s;s, or for not having timely di&s;cover'd it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the mean time</HI> Don John <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria, <HI>who was brought up as the Natural Son, chang'd not his Condition, though this ought to have been, had he been indeed the lawful Son; yet notwith&s;tand|ing this, his Creatures affirm, He &s;o exactly re&s;embles Q.</HI> Eliza|beth, <HI>that &s;he needs no other Picture of her Likene&s;s. And this Opinion fails not of gaining Belief with the People, who run vio|lently after Novelties, and who &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved this great Queen, that they bewail her &s;till as if &s;he was but now deceas'd. It is true, that if</HI> Don John <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria <HI>would make his Advan|tage of the favourable Di&s;po&s;itions of the People, he has met with &s;everal Opportunities of extending his Fortune very far; but his only Aim is to &s;erve the King, and to keep his Subjects in tho&s;e Sentiments of Fidelity they ought to have for him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To return to</HI> Calderonna: <HI>The King &s;urpri&s;ed one day the Duke</HI> de Medina <HI>with her, and in the exce&s;s of his Rage, he ran to him with his Poynard in his Hand; he was about to kill him, when this Woman placed her &s;elf between, telling him, He might &s;trike her if he would. Having the mo&s;t extream Pa&s;&s;ion for her, he could not but Pardon him, contenting him&s;elf only with bani&s;h|ing him: But under&s;tanding &s;he continu'd to love him, and write to him, he &s;tudied only how to get a new Pa&s;&s;ion; when he had one &s;trong enough not to apprehend the Charms of</HI> Calderonna, <HI>he &s;ent word to her to retire into a Mona&s;tery, as is cu&s;tomary when the King for&s;akes his Mistre&s;s. She put it not off, writing a Letter to the Duke, to bid him Adieu: And &s;he receiv'd the Veil of a Religio from the Hand of the Apo&s;tolick Nuncio, who became &s;ince</HI> Innocent X. <HI>It is very likely the King believ'd</HI> Don John <HI>was his real Son, &s;eeing he loved him &s;o dearly: One thing will appear to you very &s;ingular, which is, that a King of</HI> Spain <HI>having Natural Sons owned by him, they never entred</HI> Madrid <HI>during his Life: So</HI> Don John <HI>was brought up at</HI> Ocanna, <HI>which is &s;ome Leagues di&s;tant from it. The King, his Father, came oft thither, and he made him come even to the Gates of the Town, where he went to meet him. This Custom comes from that the Grandees of</HI> Spain <HI>di&s;pute the Rank which the&s;e Princes would hold.</HI> Don John, <HI>before he went into</HI> Catalonia, <HI>remain'd commonly at</HI> Buen Retiro, <HI>which is a Royal Seat, at one of the farthe&s;t parts of</HI> Madrid, <HI>a little without the Gate: And he &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o little, that he was never &s;een at any Publick

<P><HI>Whil&s;t the Queen,</HI> Maria Ann <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria, <HI>Si&s;ter to the Empe|rour, and the King's Mother, Govern'd</HI> Spain; <HI>and her Son was not yet of Age to hold the Reigns of the State. She would have al|ways</HI> Don John <HI>keep from the Court; and more-over, found her &s;elf &s;o capable of Governing, that &s;he had a mind to ea&s;e her Son for a long time of the Burden of Ruling. She was not troubled to &s;ee him ignorant of whatever might give a de&s;ire of Reigning: but though &s;he brought the greate&s;t Precautions, to hinder him from feeling he was under too strict a Tutelage, and &s;uffered no Per&s;ons to come near him, but tho&s;e &s;he was well a&s;&s;ured of; yet this hindred not but &s;ome of the King's Faithful Servants hazarded them&s;elves, by giving him to under&s;tand what he might do for his Liberty. He follow'd the Advice was given him; and in fine, having taken Mea&s;ures accordingly, he stole away one Night, and went to</HI> Buen Retiro. <HI>He as &s;oon &s;ent from thence an Order to the Queen his Mother, not to &s;tir out of the Palace.</HI></P>
<P>Don John <HI>is of a middle Stature, well &s;haped, Black, and lively Eyes, and a most Manly Countenance. He is Polite, Gene|rous, and very Brave. He is ignorant of nothing befitting his Birth, being well-ver&s;t in all Arts and Sciences. He writes and &s;peaks very well five Languages, and under&s;tands yet more. He has for a long time &s;tudied Judicial A&s;trology. There is no In|&s;trument which he cannot make, and u&s;e with the be&s;t Ma&s;ters. He works on all kind of Mechanicks, makes Arms, and paints finely. He took a great Plea&s;ure in the Mathematicks; but be|ing charg'd with the Government of the State, he has been oblig'd to lay a&s;ide all other Employments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He came to</HI> Buen-Retiro <HI>in the beginning of the Year</HI> 1677. <HI>and as &s;oon as he was there, he &s;ent the Queen-Mother to</HI> Toledo, <HI>becau&s;e &s;he had declared again&s;t him, and hindred his return to the King.</HI> Don John <HI>had an extream Joy in receiving from the King's own Hand an Order to take Care of Every thing, and to manage the Affairs of the Kingdom: And 'twas not without occa|&s;ion he di&s;charg'd him&s;elf on him, &s;eeing he then was ignorant of the Art of Reigning. It was alledg'd for a Rea&s;on of his &s;low Education, That the King his Father was dying when he gave him Life: That when he came into the World, they were fain to put him in a Box of Cotten, being &s;o tender and &s;mall, that he could not be &s;wadled: That he was brought up in the Arms, and on the Knees of the Ladies of the Palace, till he was Ten Years old, with|out putting his Foot once all this while on the Ground to walk: That in the Sequel the Queen his Mother, who was engaged by
<PB N="43" REF="24"> all the Ties of Natural Duty to pre&s;erve this only Heir of the</HI> Spa|ni&s;h <HI>Branch, fearing to lo&s;e him, dared not let him &s;tudy, lest by two great an Application he &s;hould lo&s;e his Health, which in truth was very un&s;ound: And 'twas ob&s;erv'd, that the great Number of Women, with whom the King always was, and who too &s;harply reprehended him for his Faults which he committed, had in&s;pired him with &s;uch a great Aver&s;ion to them, that as &s;oon as ever he had notice a Lady &s;taid for him in any place he was to pa&s;s, he stole another way, or kept him&s;elf &s;hut up all day in his Chamber. The Marchione&s;s</HI> de Luz Veles, <HI>who was his Governe&s;s, told me, &s;he waited for an Opportunity full &s;ix Months to &s;peak with him, and when Chance had brought them vnavoidably to him, he took, their Reque&s;ts from their Hands, but turn'd his Head another way, for fear he &s;hould &s;ee them. His Health is &s;ince &s;o increa&s;ed, that his Marriage with the Arch-Dutche&s;s, the Emperor's Daughter, having been broke off by</HI> Don John, <HI>by rea&s;on 'twas the Queen-Mothers Project, he has de&s;ired to marry</HI> Mademoi&s;elled' Orleans. <HI>The Circumstances of the Peace which are lately concluded at</HI> Ni|miguen, <HI>made him ca&s;t his Eyes towards this Prince&s;s, with who&s;e excellent Qualities, Madam, you are better acquainted than I.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is hard to believe, that having Di&s;po&s;itions &s;o far from Gal|lantry, he &s;hould become &s;o &s;uddenly and vehemently in love with the Queen, as he became on the only Rehear&s;al of her good Quali|ties, and at the &s;ight of her Picture in Minature, which was &s;hew'd him. He never lets it go out of his Hand; he always holds it to his Heart; He Dialogues with it &s;o prettily, as a&s;to|ni&s;hes all the Courtiers; for he &s;peaks a Language he never &s;poke: His Pa&s;&s;ion for the Prince&s;s furni&s;hes him with a thou&s;and Thoughts, which he dares not entru&s;t any body with. He thinks no body makes haste enough; and therefore &s;ends fre&s;h Curriers every day to car|ry his Billets</HI> doux, <HI>and bring hack News of her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When you come to</HI> Madrid, added he, <HI>you will hear, Madam, &s;everal Particulars which have without doubt hapned &s;ince I was there, and which will perhaps more &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity than what I have related to you.</HI> I am very much oblig'd to you, <HI>an&s;wered I,</HI> for your Civilities; but do me the Favour to ob|lige me farther, in giving me the true Character of the <HI>Spa|niards:</HI> You know them, and I am per&s;waded nothing has e&s;cap'd your Enquiries; You &s;peaking to me without Pa&s;&s;ion and Intere&s;t, I may reckon my &s;elf &s;ure of what you tell me. <HI>Why believe you, Madam,</HI> replied he &s;miling, <HI>that I &s;hall &s;peak to you more &s;incerely than another? There are Rea&s;ons which may render me &s;u&s;pected: They are my Ma&s;ters; I mu&s;t manage them;
<PB N="44" REF="25"> And if I be not Politick enough to do it, the Vexation of being con|strained to obey them, would tempt me to entertain Notions in their Re&s;pect contrary to Truth.</HI> However it be, <HI>&s;aid I, inter|rupting him,</HI> pray tell me what you know of them.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Spaniards, &s;aid he, <HI>have always pa&s;t for Fierce and Glo|rious: This Glory is mixt with Gravity; and they carry it &s;o far, that one may call it an extravagant Pride: They are Brave, with|out being Ra&s;h; yet they are accu&s;ed for not being daring enough; They are Cholerick, Revengeful, without &s;hewing any Tran&s;port, Liberal without Ostentation, Sober in their Diet, very Pre&s;umtu|ous in Pro&s;perity, too Rampant in Adver&s;ity: They Idolize Women; they are &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;t in their Favour, that they &s;hew no Di&s;cretion in the Choice of their Wives: They are Patient to Exce&s;s, Ob&s;ti|nate, Idle, Singular, Philo&s;ophi&s;ers: And as to the rest, Men of Honour, keeping their Words, tho' it co&s;t 'em their Lives. They have a great deal of Wit and Vivacity, ea&s;ily comprehend, ex|plain them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner, and in few Words; They are Prudent, Jealous without mea&s;ure, Di&s;intere&s;ted, bad Oeconomi&s;ts, Clo&s;e, Super&s;titious, great Catholicks, at lea&s;t in appearance: They are good Poets, and write Ver&s;es with great Facility. They would be capable of Nobler Sciences, would they vouch&s;afe to apply them&s;elves thereto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They have a Greatne&s;s of Soul, Elevated Wit, Con&s;tancy, a Na|tural Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and a Re&s;pect for Ladies, as is not &s;een el&s;e|where: They have a Set-Behaviour, full of Affectation, intoxica|ted with their own Merit, hardly ever in this Particular doing Right to that of others. Their Bravery con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tanding Vali|antly on the Defen&s;ive Part, without giving Ground, and without dreading Danger; but they love not to &s;eek it, which proceeds from their great Judgment: They di&s;cern Danger, and avoid it. Their greatest Defect, in my Opinion, is the Pa&s;&s;ion of Revenge and the Means they u&s;e for this: Their Maxims hereupon are ab&s;o|lutely oppo&s;ite to Chri&s;tianity and Honour: When they have receiv'd an Affront, they make him be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated who has offered it. They are not contented with this; for they cau&s;e them to be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated likewi&s;e whom they have offended, in the Apprehention of being prevented, knowing well, that if they do not kill, they &s;hall be kill'd them&s;elves. They pretend to ju&s;tifie them&s;elves herein, when they &s;ay, That their Enemy having took the fir&s;t Advantage, they ought to &s;ecure them&s;elves of the &s;ecend: That &s;hould they fail herein, they would wrong their Reputation: That you mu&s;t not fight with a Man that has in&s;ulted over you, but put your &s;elf in a Condition to puni&s;h him, without running half the Danger. It is true, that Impunity Authori&s;es this Conduct; for the Priviledge
<PB N="45" REF="25"> of Churches and Convents in</HI> Spain, <HI>is to give an a&s;&s;ured Retreat to Criminals; And as near as they can, they commit the&s;e Vil|lanies hard by a Sanctuary, no have the le&s;s way to an Altar; Which you &s;ee oft embraced by a Villain, with his Poynard reeking in his Hand, and be-&s;meared with the Blood of the Murther which he has committed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to their Per&s;ons, they are very lean, little, fine &s;hape, come|ly Head, good Faces, fine Eyes, well-&s;et Teeth, yellow and duski&s;h Complexion; they will have one walk &s;lowly, commend big Legs, and a little Foot, Shooes without Heels, parting the Hair on both &s;ides, being &s;trait cut, and kept behind their Ears with a great Two-handed Hat, an Habit always Black, in&s;tead of a Shirt, Taffity Sleeves, or black Tabby, a Sword of a &s;trange length, with a black Freize Cloak over all this, very &s;trait Breeches, hanging Sleeves, and a Poynard. All this mu&s;t &s;o di&s;-figure a Man, let him be otherwi&s;e never &s;o well-&s;haped, that they &s;eem to affect a Garb the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable; And ones Eyes cannot with any Com|placency accu&s;tom them&s;elves to this fight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Frederick</HI> would have continued on his Di&s;cour&s;e, and I had &s;o much plea&s;ure in hearing him, that I would not have interrupted him; but he broke off him&s;elf, having ob&s;erv'd that the Play was at an end, and con|&s;idering, that we were to &s;et out early next Morning, he thought I might be de&s;irous of retiring; he therefore with the other Gentlemen, bad me good Night. I ro&s;e in effect very &s;oon next Morning, becau&s;e 'twas a great Journey to <HI>Birbie&s;ca,</HI> where we intended to lie. We follow'd the River to avoid the Mountains, and pa&s;t at <HI>Oron,</HI> a great River, which falls into the <HI>Ehre.</HI> We a while after entred into &s;o &s;trait a Way, that our Litters could &s;carce pa&s;s: We a&s;|cended along, a very &s;trait Coa&s;t to <HI>Pancorvo,</HI> who&s;e Ca&s;tle I &s;aw &s;tanding on a rais'd Ground, not far di&s;tant: We tra|ver&s;t a great Plain; and this was a Novelty to us, to &s;ee an even Country: This here is &s;urrounded with &s;everal Moun|tains, which &s;eem linkt together as a Chain, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Occa:</HI> We mu&s;t again pa&s;s over a little River, before we can come to <HI>Birbie&s;ca:</HI> This is only a Borough, which has nothing remarkable but its Colledge, and &s;ome few plea&s;ant Gardens along the Water. But I may &s;ay, we came thither in wor&s;e Weather than any we had yet: I was &s;o tired, that as &s;oon as I arriv'd I went to Bed: &s;o that I &s;aw not <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and the other Gentlemen, till the next Day, at <HI>Ca&s;tel de Peones.</HI> But I &s;hould tell you how one is &s;erv'd in the&s;e Inns, they being all alike: When you come into one of
<PB N="46" REF="26"> them, wearied and tired, roa&s;ted by the heat of the Sun, or frozen by the Snows (for there is &s;eldom any Temperament be|tween the&s;e Two Extreams), you &s;ee neither Pot on the Fire, nor Plates wa&s;h'd: You enter into the Stable, and from thence to your Chamber; this Stable is ordinarily full of Mules and Muletteers, who make u&s;e of their Mules Saddles for Pillows in the night, and in the day-time they &s;erve 'em for Tables: They eat very friendly with their Mules, and are very good Company together.</P>
<P>The Stair-Ca&s;e by which you go up is very &s;trait, and does rather re&s;emble a &s;orry Ladder: <HI>La Sennoro de la Ca&s;a</HI> receives you with her Gown tuckt up, and her dangling Sleeves; &s;he takes time to put on her <HI>Sunday</HI>-Cloathes, whil&s;t you get out of your Litter: and &s;he never omits this; for they are all very Poor and Vain Glorious. You are &s;hewed a Chamber, who&s;e Walls are white enough, hung with a thou&s;and little &s;curvy Pictures of Saints; the Beds are without Curtains, the Co|vertures of Cotton, the Sheets as large as Napkins, and the Napkins like Pocket-hankerchiefs; and you mu&s;t be in &s;ome con&s;iderable Town to find four or five of them; for in other places there are none, no more than there are Forks: They have only a Cup in the Hou&s;e; and if the Mule-Drivers get fir&s;t hold of it, which commonly happens, if they plea&s;e, (for they are &s;erv'd with more Re&s;pect than tho&s;e whom they bring) you mu&s;t &s;tay patiently till they have done with it, or drink out of an Earthen Pitcher. It is impo&s;&s;ible to warm one at the Kitchin-fire, without being choaked, for they have no Chimneys; and 'tis the &s;ame in all the Hou&s;es on the Road; there is an Hole made in the top of the Ceiling, and the Smoak goes out thence; the Fire is in the mid&s;t of the Kitchin: They put what you would have roa&s;ted on Tiles, and when 'tis well gril'd on one &s;ide, they turn the other: when 'tis gro&s;s Meat, they fa&s;ten it to a String, and &s;o let it hang on the Fire, and turn it with their Hands; &s;o that the Smoak makes it &s;o black, that it would turn ones Stomach to look on it.</P>
<P>I think there cannot be a better Repre&s;entation of Hell than the&s;e &s;ort of Kitchins, and the Per&s;ons in them; for not to &s;peak of this horrible Smoak, which blinds and choaks one, they are a Dozen of Men, and as many Women, blacker than Devils, na&s;ty and &s;tinking like Swine, and clad like Beggars. There are always &s;ome of 'em impudently grating on a &s;orry Guiter, and &s;inging like a Cat a roa&s;ting. The Women have all of 'em their Hair about their Ears, and you would take 'em for <HI>Bedlamites;</HI> they have Gla&s;s Necklaces, which hang twi&s;ted
<PB N="47" REF="26"> about their Necks like Ropes of Onions, but however &s;erve to cover the Na&s;tine&s;s of their Skin. They are as great Thieves as any are in Jayls, and they are urgent to &s;erve you only to have an opportunity to &s;teal &s;omething of you, though it be but a Pin.</P>
<P>Before all things, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e brings you her little Children, who are bare-headed in the mid&s;t of Winter, though but of a Day old: &s;he makes 'em touch your Cloaths, &s;he rubs their Eyes with them, their Cheeks, Throat, and Hands. This &s;eems as if one was become a Relick, and could heal all Di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e Ceremonies over, you are askt, If you will eat any thing; and though at Mid-night, you mu&s;t &s;end to the Butchery, the Market, the Tavern, the Bakers; in fine, to all parts of the Town, to gather wherewith to make a &s;orry Meal. For though the Mutton here be very tender, their way of frying it with Oyl, is not to every Bodies Reli&s;h. Here are great &s;tore of Partridges, and tho&s;e very large; they are not very fat, but dry; and to make 'em drier, they roa&s;t 'em to a Coal. The Pidgeons here are excellent; and in &s;eve-places here is good Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Be&s;&s;ugo&s;&s;es, which have the ta&s;te of a Trout, and of which they make Pa&s;ties, which would be good, were they not &s;tuff'd with Garlick, Saffron, and Pep|per. Their Bread is white enough, and &s;weet, that one would think it made up with Sugar; but it is ill wrought, and &s;o lit|tle baked, that it is as heavy as Lead in the Stomach: it has the &s;hape of a flat Cake, and is not much thicker than one's Finger. The Wine is good, and Fruits in their &s;ea&s;on, e&s;pecially Grapes, which are very large, and of delicate ta&s;te. You may reckon your &s;elf certain of a good De&s;art. You have Sallads here of &s;uch good Lettice as the World cannot afford better.</P>
<P>Do not think (Dear Co&s;in) 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, Go fetch &s;uch things, to have them; for not very &s;eldom you can meet with nothing: But &s;uppo&s;ing you find what you would have, you mu&s;t give out your Money before-hand: &s;o that your Meat is paid for before you have begun to eat it; for the Ma&s;ter of the Inn is only allowed to Lodge you: they alledge for a Rea|&s;on, That it is not ju&s;t one only Per&s;on &s;hould go away with all the Profit from Travellers, it being better the Money &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>You enter not any Inn to Dine, but carry your Provi&s;ion with you, and &s;top at the Bank of &s;ome River, where the Mule-Drivers bate their Mules; and this is with Oats or Barley, with chopt Straw, which they carry with them in great Sacks; for as to Hay they give them 'em none. It is not allow'd a

<HEAD>LETTER. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WE could &s;en&s;ibly perceive in arriving at <HI>Burgos,</HI> that this Town is colder than any of tho&s;e we pa&s;t; and 'tis like|wi&s;e &s;aid, you have none of tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Heats which are intollerable in other Parts of <HI>Spain:</HI> The Town &s;tands where you de&s;cend the Mountain, and reaches to the Plain as far as the River, which wa&s;hes the foot of the Wall: the Streets are very &s;trait and even: the Ca&s;tle is not great, but very &s;trong, and is &s;een on the top of the Mountain: A little lower is the Tri|umphant Arch of <HI>Fernando Gon&s;ales,</HI> which the Curious do much admire. This Town was the fir&s;t that was conquer'd from the <HI>Mores;</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have long re&s;ided here; 'tis the Capital of <HI>Old Ca&s;tille;</HI> it holds the fir&s;t Rank in the two States of the two <HI>Ca&s;tilles,</HI> although <HI>Toledo</HI> di&s;putes it with her: You &s;ee her fine Buildings; and <HI>Vela&s;coe</HI>'s Palace is very &s;tately. Here are in all the broad Streets and &s;pacious
<PB N="51" REF="28"> Places, Fountains, with Statues, &s;ome of which are good Pieces; but the fine&s;t &s;ight is the Cathedral, which is &s;o large, that Ma&s;s is &s;aid in five &s;everal places of it, without any di|&s;turbance to each other: the Architecture is &s;o exqui&s;itely wrought, that it may pa&s;s among the <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings for a Ma&s;ter-Piece of Art: and this is &s;o much the more remarkable, in that they build very &s;orrily in <HI>Spain:</HI> in &s;ome places this is &s;o through Poverty, and in others want of Stone and Lime: I am told, that even at <HI>Madrid</HI> you &s;ee Hou&s;es of Earth, and the fine&s;t are made with Brick, cemented with the &s;ame, for want of Lime. To pa&s;s from the Town to the Suburbs of <HI>Bega,</HI> you go over three Stone Bridges: the Gate which an&s;wers that of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> &s;tands high, with the Image of the Virgin upon it: this Suburb contains the greate&s;t part of the Convents and Ho&s;pitals; there is a great one founded by <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|cond, to receive the Pilgrims which go to St. <HI>James,</HI> and which entertains them for a Day. The Abbey of <HI>Miile Flores,</HI> who&s;e Building is very &s;tately, is not far di&s;tant. You &s;ee here in this Suburb &s;everal Gardens which are watered with Fountains and plea&s;ant Springs; the River &s;erves for a Chan|nel: And you find in a great Park inclo&s;ed with Walls, plea|&s;ant Walks at all times of the Year.</P>
<P>I would have &s;een the Crucifix in the <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> Convent; it is placed in a Chappel of the Cloy&s;ter, large and dark enough, &s;o that you could hardly di&s;cern it, were it not for the Lamps, which are continually burning, they'r above an hundred; &s;ome are of Gold, and others of Silver, of &s;o extraordinary a &s;ize, that they cover all the Vault of this Chappel: there are &s;ixty Silver Candle&s;ticks of a length, exceeding the talle&s;t Man, and &s;o heavy that two Men cannot lift 'em: they &s;tand on the ground on both &s;ides of the Altar; tho&s;e which are upon it are of Ma&s;&s;y Gold: You &s;ee between 'em two Cro&s;&s;es of the &s;ame, &s;et out with Precious Stones, and Crowns hanging over the Altar, adorn'd with Pearls and Diamonds of great Lu&s;tre; The Chappel is hung with Tapi&s;try, wrought with Gold; it is &s;o laden with rich Gifts, that there's hardly room to put 'em in, &s;o that part of 'em are kept in the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The Holy Crucifix &s;tands on the Altar, near the natural big|ne&s;s, it is covered with three Curtains one on another, all embrodered with Pearls and Diamonds: When they open them, which is not done without great Ceremony, and for Per&s;ons of Quality, &s;everal Bells are rung, every one falls on his Knees: and it mu&s;t be granted, that this place and &s;ight &s;trikes one with an Awful Regard: The Crucifix is of Carv'd
<PB N="52" REF="29"> Work, and cannot be better made; its Carnation is very na|tural; it is covered from the Brea&s;ts to the Feet with a fine Linnen, in &s;everal Foulds or Pleats, which makes it look like a loo&s;e Jerkin, which in my Opinion, is not over-agreea|ble.</P>
<P>It is commonly held, that <HI>Nicodemus</HI> made it; but tho&s;e who are for making every thing Miraculous, will have it brought down from Heaven, they know not how nor when. I was told, certain Monks of this Town had once &s;tole it, and con|vey'd it away; but it took a convenient time to give 'em the &s;lip, and was found the next Morning in the Chappel, in its u&s;ual place: The&s;e hone&s;t People being enraged, that it &s;hould &s;erve 'em &s;uch a Trick, mu&s;tered up their Forces, and violently laid Hands on't the &s;econd time, but to as little purpo&s;e; for 'twould by no means &s;tay with 'em: However, it works Mira|cles, and is one of the chief Objects of Devotion in <HI>Spain:</HI> The Religious tell you, it &s;weats every <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>I was going into my Inn, when we &s;aw the <HI>Sieur de Car|donne</HI>'s <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> running as fa&s;t as he could after us; he was booted, and three Friers &s;cowring after him: I was o|ver-ra&s;h in my Judgment; for I could not but think he had &s;tole &s;omething in this rich Chappel, and was taken in the Fact; but his Ma&s;ter, who was with me, having demanded of him, What put him on &s;uch full &s;peed; He an&s;wer'd, He went into the Chappel of the Holy Crucifix with his Spurs on, and the Fryers had kept him in cu&s;tody, to get Money of him, but that he was gotten out of their Clutches, but they were now upon the Hunt for him. They make it a Forfeit, as well as others, for a Man to go with Spurs into the&s;e Holy Places.</P>
<P>The Town is not very great; it is adorned with a &s;pacious Place; here are high Pillars which bear up very fine Lodgings. The Bull-Fea&s;ts are kept here; for the People are much delight|ed with this &s;ort of Diverti&s;ement. There is al&s;o a very well-built Bridge, long and large: the River which pa&s;&s;es under it bathes a Meadow, on the Bank of which you &s;ee Allies of Trees, which form a mo&s;t delicious Walk. Trade was hereto|fore con&s;iderable, but it is of late much dimini&s;ht. The be&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tillian</HI> is here &s;poken; and the Men are naturally Souldi|ers, &s;o that when the King has need of them, he finds here great Numbers, and better Men than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>After Supper our Company &s;et to Play, as heretofore: <HI>Don Sancho Sanniento</HI> was for yielding his place to any one, pretend|ing 'twas his Right to entertain me this Evening. I knew he had lately return'd from <HI>Sicily;</HI> I askt him, whether he had
<PB N="53" REF="29"> been one of tho&s;e who had help'd to Cha&s;tize tho&s;e Rebellious People? [Alas, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Las Navas</HI> was &s;ufficient to puni&s;h them beyond what their Crime de|&s;erv'd: I was at <HI>Naples,</HI> in the de&s;ign to pa&s;s into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where I have Relations of the &s;ame Name. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Veles,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> engaged me to leave my fir&s;t Project, and embark my &s;elf with the Marque&s;s <HI>de Las Navas,</HI> whom the King &s;ent into <HI>Sicily:</HI> We &s;et Sail in two Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Majorca,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>January.</HI> Having &s;ent no notice of his coming, and no body expecting it, he was not receiv'd with the Honours paid commonly to the Vice-Roys: But in truth, his Intentions were &s;o cruel again&s;t the&s;e poor People, that his Entrance &s;hould have been made in Tears.</P>
<P>Scarcely was he arriv'd, but he clapt up the two Sheriffs in Pri&s;on, named <HI>Vicenzo Zuffo,</HI> and <HI>Don Diego:</HI> He put <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Places; he rigorou&s;ly aboli&s;ht the Colledge of Knights of the Star; and began to execute the Orders which <HI>Gonzaga</HI> had long receiv'd, and which he had eluded through Favour or Weakne&s;s. He immediately publi&s;ht an Order, by which the King chang'd all the Form of Government of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> depriv'd the Town of its Revenues, forbad its bearing for the future the Glorious Title of <HI>Exemplary,</HI> di&s;&s;olv'd the Senate, and put into the place of &s;ix Sheriffs, &s;ix Officers, two of which &s;hould be <HI>Spaniards;</HI> that the&s;e Officers &s;hould not for the future appear in Publick with their Formalities; that they &s;hould no more be preceded by Drums and Trumpets, ride no more together in a Coach with four Hor&s;es, as they were wont; that they &s;hould fit henceforward on a plain Bench; &s;hould have no more Incen&s;e offered 'em in the Churches; go cloath'd after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion; &s;hould A&s;&s;emble on Publick Affairs in a Chamber of the Vice-Roy's Palace; and have no longer any Juri&s;diction on the Champian Country.</P>
<P>Every one was &s;eized with &s;uch Con&s;ternation, as if he had been Thunder-&s;truck; but their Sorrow was much increa&s;ed on the fifth of the &s;ame Month, when the Camp Ma&s;ter-Gene|ral went to the Town-hou&s;e, and &s;eized all their Charters, and Original Copies of their Priviledges, and made 'em be burnt publickly by the Hands of the common Hang-man. The Prince <HI>de Condro</HI> was afterwards apprehended, to the great grief of his Family, but particularly the Prince&s;s <HI>Elenora,</HI> his Si&s;ter, who&s;e Tears were not &s;hed alone: this Prince&s;s is not above Eighteen; her Beauty and Wit are miraculous, which a&s;toni&s;h tho&s;e about her. <HI>Don Sancho</HI>'s Eyes grew red at the
<PB N="54" REF="30"> remembrance of this Prince&s;s, and I plainly perceiv'd Pity had not all the &s;hare in what he &s;aid; yet he continued on his Di&s;cour&s;e to me of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-Roy, <HI>added he,</HI> publi&s;ht an Order, by which all the Citizens were enjoyn'd, under penalty of ten Years Impri|&s;onment, and five thou&s;and Crowns Fine, to bring their Arms into his Palace. He at the &s;ame time caus'd the great Bell in the Town-hou&s;e to be taken down, and beaten to pieces in their &s;ight: He ordered all the Bells in the Cathedral to be melted, to make a Statue of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And the Prince of <HI>Condro</HI>'s Children were taken into Cu&s;tody: But their Fear increa&s;ed, when the Vice-Roy ordered <HI>D. V. Zuffo</HI>'s Head to be cut off. This Example of Severity Alarum'd all the People; and what appear'd mo&s;t terrible, was, That in the late Trou|bles, &s;ome Families of <HI>Me&s;&s;inois</HI> having withdrawn them&s;elves into &s;everal Parts, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dor at <HI>Rome,</HI> advi&s;ed them, as a Friend, to return into their own Country, a&s;&s;uring them all was Quier, and that a General Pardon was already publi&s;ht; and for their greater a&s;&s;urance, gave them <HI>Pa&s;tports.</HI> The&s;e poor People (who had not taken up Arms, and being not of the number of the Revolters, know|ing their Innocency, could never have imagin'd they &s;hould have been treated as Criminals] return'd to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> where they had &s;carcely landed, but the Joy they had of &s;eeing them|&s;elves in their Native Country, and in the mid&s;t, of their Friends, was &s;adly di&s;turb'd, when they were &s;ei&s;ed on, and the next Morning, without any Quarter, or regard to Sex or Age, by the Vice-Roy's Order, all hang'd. He afterwards, &s;ent to demoli&s;h the great Tower of <HI>Palermo;</HI> and the princi|pal Citizens of it, remon&s;trating again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive Impo|&s;itions on Corn, Silks, and other Commodities, the Marque&s;s <HI>de las Navas</HI> &s;ent them all to the Gallies, without being mo|ved by the Tears of their Wives, and the need &s;o many poor Children might have of their Fathers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, <HI>continued Don Sancho,</HI> that my Nature is &s;o aver&s;e to the Rigors every day exercis'd on the&s;e poor People, that I could not for all the World remain any longer at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> The Marque&s;s <HI>de las Navas</HI> was for &s;ending to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> to inform the King of what he had done. I intreated him to charge me with this Commi&s;&s;ion; and in effect he con&s;ented, and gave me his Letters, which I have delivered to the King at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and at the &s;ame time my Interce&s;&s;ions for the Prince <HI>de Condro:</HI> And I pre&s;ume my good Offices will not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to him. I am per&s;waded, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="30"> this was the principal Motive of your Journey: I am no pry|ing body, but methinks you are greatly concern'd for the In|tere&s;ts of this Family. It's true, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI> the In|ju&s;tice done this Unfortunate Prince does &s;en&s;ibly affect me: Were he not Brother to the Prince&s;s <HI>Eleonora, &s;aid I to him,</HI> perhaps you would not &s;o much lay it to heart. But no more of this; I perceive this Remembrance afflicts you. Pray let me rather hear from you what is mo&s;t remarkable in your Country. Ah! Madam, <HI>cried he,</HI> you in&s;ult over me; for you mu&s;t needs know, that <HI>Galicia</HI> is &s;o poor and mean a Countrey that there's no place for bragging; not but that the Town of St. <HI>James de Compo&s;tella</HI> is con&s;iderable enough: it is the Capi|tal of the Province, and &s;carce one in <HI>Spain</HI> that's &s;uperiour to it in Riches and Greatne&s;s: Its Archbi&s;hoprick is worth Seventy Thou&s;and Crowns a Year, and the Chapter has as much; It &s;tands in an agreeable Plain, &s;urrounded with little Hills of moderate heighth; and it &s;eems as if Nature had placed them there to defend the Town from tho&s;e deadly Bla&s;ts which ari&s;e from other Mountains. Here is a Univer&s;ity, fine Palaces, &s;tately Churches, publick Places, and an Ho&s;pital, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and be&s;t &s;erv'd in <HI>Europe:</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of two Courts of Extraordinary greatne&s;s, with Fountains in the mid&s;t. Several Knights of St. <HI>James</HI> live in this Town, and the Metropolis, which is dedicated to this Saint, keeps his Bo|dy: It is extream &s;tately, and prodigiou&s;ly rich: It is pre|tended you hear a kind of Clattering at his Tomb, as if Arms were &s;truck one again&s;t another; and this noi&s;e is only heard when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to undergo any great Lo&s;s. His Figure is repre&s;ented on the Altar, and the Pilgrims thrice ki&s;s it, and put their Hats on his Head; for this is the chief part of the Ceremony: they have al&s;o another very &s;ingular one; they a&s;cend the top of the Church, which is covered with great flat Stones; In this place &s;tands a Cro&s;s of Iron, whereon the Pil|grims ever fa&s;ten &s;ome Rag, or Scrap of what they wear: They pa&s;s under this Cro&s;s by &s;o &s;trait a Pa&s;&s;age, that they are forced to crawl on their Bellies through it; and tho&s;e who are not &s;lender, are in danger of being bur&s;ten. And there have been &s;ome &s;o ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious, that having omitted to do this, they have expre&s;ly return'd back again three or four hun|dred Leagues; for you &s;ee here Pilgrims of all Nations. Here is a <HI>French</HI> Chappel, of which great Care is taken; It is &s;aid, the Kings of <HI>France</HI> have been always great Benefactors to it. The Church which is under ground is a better than that above; there are &s;tately Tombs, and Epitaphs of great Antiquity,
<PB N="56" REF="31"> which exerci&s;e the Wits of Travellers. The Archiepi&s;copal Palace is a va&s;t Pile, and its Antiquity adds to its Beauty, in|&s;tead of dimini&s;hing it. A Man of my Acquaintance, a great Searcher into Etymologies, a&s;&s;ured me the Town of <HI>Compo|&s;tella</HI> was &s;o called, becau&s;e St. <HI>James</HI> was to &s;uffer Martyr|dom in the place where he &s;hould &s;ee a Star appear at <HI>Compe&s;|tella.</HI> It is true, <HI>continued he,</HI> that &s;ome People pretend it to be thus; but the Peoples Credulity and Super&s;tition car|ries 'em further; for you are &s;hew'd at <HI>Padron,</HI> near <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> an hollow Stone; and it is pretended this was the little Boat in which St. <HI>James</HI> arriv'd, after he had pa&s;t &s;o many Seas in it, which being of Stone, mu&s;t have, without a &s;ignal Mira|cle, &s;unk to the bottom. I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> you believe this to be mo&s;t true. <HI>He &s;miled, and continued his Di&s;cour&s;e:</HI> I cannot but give you the De&s;cription of our <HI>Militia:</HI> They are called together every Year in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and all the Young Men from the Age of Fifteen, are oblig'd to march; for &s;hould it happen that a Father, or any other Relation &s;hould conceal his Son or Kin&s;man, and tho&s;e who are Officers &s;hould come to know it, they would condemn him who has &s;o of|fended, to perpetual Impri&s;onment. There have been &s;ome Examples of this, but they are rare; for the Pea&s;ants are &s;o infinitely pleas'd to &s;ee them&s;elves Arm'd, and treated as <HI>Ca|valieros &amp; de Nobles Saldados del Rey,</HI> that they would not for any Con&s;ideration be wanting to &s;hew them&s;elves on this oc|ca&s;ion. You &s;hall &s;eldom &s;ee in an whole Regiment any Soul|dier that has more Shirts than that on his Back; and the Stuff they wear, &s;eems for its Coar&s;ene&s;s to be made of Pack-thread: their Shooes are made of Cord; they wear no Stockins, yet eve|ry Man has his Peacock, or Dunghil-Cock's Feather in his Cap, which is tied up behind, with a Rag about his Neck in form of a Ruff; their Sword oftentimes hangs by their &s;ide tied with a bit of Cord, and ordinary without a Scabbard; the re&s;t of their Arms is &s;eldom in better Order: And in this Equipage they march gravely to <HI>Tuy,</HI> where is the General Rendezvouz, it being a Frontier place to <HI>Portugal.</HI> There are three which lie thus, the above-mention'd, <HI>Cindud-Rodrigo,</HI> and <HI>Badajor,</HI> but <HI>Tuy</HI> is the be&s;t guarded, becau&s;e it is over-again&s;t <HI>Valentia,</HI> a con&s;iderable Town belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and which has been carefully fortifi'd: The&s;e two Towns are &s;o near, that their Cannon will reach each other; and if the <HI>Portu|gui&s;es</HI> have omitted nothing to put <HI>Valentia</HI> out of danger of being in&s;ulted over, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend <HI>Tuy</HI> is in as good a Condition to defend it &s;elf; It &s;tands on an Hill, who&s;e lower

<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable things, in my mind, in this Kingdom, is the Town of <HI>Doien&s;e,</HI> one part of which always enjoys the Sweetne&s;s of the Spring, and the Fruits of Autumn, by rea&s;on of &s;everal Springs of boiling Water, which warm the Air by their Exhalations; whil'&s;t the other part of this &s;ame Town &s;uffers the Rigors of the longe&s;t Winters, &s;tanding as it does at the Foot of a very cold Mountain; &s;o that you find in the &s;pace of one only Sea&s;on, all tho&s;e which compo&s;e the cour&s;e of the Year.</P>
<P>You &s;ay nothing, <HI>replied I to him,</HI> of the marvellous Foun|tain, call'd <HI>Louzano.</HI> Who have told you of it, Madam? <HI>an|&s;wer'd he.</HI> Per&s;ons that have &s;een it, <HI>added I.</HI> You have been then told, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> that on the top of the Mountain of <HI>Cer|bret,</HI> you find this Fountain at the Source of the River <HI>Lours;</HI> which has Flux and Reflux as the Sea, tho' it be at twenty Leagues di&s;tance from it; that the greater the Heats are, the more Water it ca&s;ts, that this Water is &s;ometimes cold as Ice, and &s;ometimes as hot as if it boil'd, there being no Natural Cau&s;e to be giv'n for it. You learn me Particulars I was ignorant of, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> and this is doing me a great Plea&s;ure, for I want not for Curio&s;ity in relation to things uncommon. I wi&s;h, <HI>replied he,</HI> 'twas not &s;o late, I would give you an account of &s;everal Rarities in <HI>Spain,</HI> and which perhaps you would gladly learn. I leave you for to Night, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> but I hope before we come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> we &s;hall have an opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing of them. He very civilly made me a Promi&s;e; and the Play being ended, we bad one another good night.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="32">
<P>When I would go to re&s;t, I was led into a Gallery full of Beds, as you &s;ee in Ho&s;pitals: I &s;aid, this was ridiculous; and that needing only four, what occa&s;ion was there for &s;hew|ing me forty, and to put me into &s;uch an open place to &s;tarve me? I was an&s;wer'd, This was the be&s;t place in the Hou&s;e, and I mu&s;t take up with it. I caus'd my Bed to be made, when &s;carce was I laid down, but &s;ome body knockt &s;oftly at my Door; my Women opened it, and remained much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s followed by a dozen of &s;orry creatures, and &s;o cloath'd that they were half naked. I drew my Curtain at the Noi&s;e they made, and opened more mine Eyes at the &s;ight of this Noble Company. The Mi&s;tre&s;s drew near to me, and told me, The&s;e were hone&s;t Travellers, who were coming into the Beds which remained empty. <HI>How, lie here?</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I believe you have lo&s;t your Sen&s;es. I &s;hould have lo&s;t 'em indeed,</HI> replied &s;he, <HI>&s;hould I let &s;o many Beds &s;tand Empty. Either, Madam, you mu&s;t pay for them, or the&s;e hone&s;t Gentlemen mu&s;t lye in them.</HI> I cannot expre&s;s my Rage to you; I was in the mind to &s;end for <HI>Don Fernand</HI> and my Knights, who would have &s;ooner made 'em pa&s;s through the Windows than through the Doors: But I con&s;idered this could not be done without &s;ome Di&s;turbance, and therefore I came to Terms, and agreed to pay 20 <HI>d.</HI> for each Bed: they are hardly dearer at <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> when the Court is there. The&s;e Illu&s;trious <HI>Dons,</HI> or, to &s;peak better, <HI>Tatterdemalions,</HI> who had the In&s;olence to come into my Room, immediately withdrew, having made me &s;everal profound Reverences.</P>
<P>The next Morning I thought to have bur&s;t with laughter, tho 'twas at my Co&s;t, when I di&s;covered mine Ho&s;te&s;s's Trick to ruin me: For you mu&s;t know in the fir&s;t place, that the&s;e pretended Travellers were their Neighbours, and that they are accu&s;tomed to this Stratagem, when they &s;ee Stran|gers: But when I would have reckoned the Beds to pay for em, they were rowled all of 'em into the mid&s;t of the Gallery; there were divers wretched Troughs of Straw pull'd out, which were hardly good enough to entertain Dogs, yet I mu&s;t pay for each 20 <HI>d.</HI> Four Pi&s;toles ended our Di&s;pute. I was not able to put my &s;elf in a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch &s;ingularity did I find in this Management. I would not recount this little Accident to you, did it not &s;erve to give you &s;ome in&s;ight into the Hu|mour of this Nation.</P>
<P>We &s;et out from <HI>Burgos</HI> very late, the Weather was &s;o bad, and there had fall'n in the Night &s;uch great quantity of Rain, that I tarry'd there as long as I could, in expectation of its
<PB N="59" REF="32"> cea&s;ing. In fine, I came to a Re&s;olution, and a&s;cended my Litter. I had not gotten far from the Town, but I repented of my leaving it; no Track cou'd be &s;een, e&s;pecially on a very high &s;teep Mountain, over which we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s. One of our Mule-drivers, who went before, &s;truck too far on the Edge of this Mountain, &s;o that he fell with his Mule into a kind of Precipice, where he broke his Head, and put his Arm out of joynt; this being the famous <HI>Philip de St. Seba&s;tian,</HI> the mo&s;t intelligent of all his Profe&s;&s;ion, and who common|ly carries Per&s;ons of Quality to <HI>Madrid;</HI> he was therefore much bemoaned; and we remain'd a great while before we could hale him out from the &s;curvy place where he had fall'n; <HI>Don Fernand</HI> was &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate as to let him have his Litter. The Night came &s;peedily on us, and we could have comforted our &s;elves, could we have return'd to <HI>Burgos,</HI> but it was impo&s;&s;ible, the ways were no le&s;s covered with Snow on that &s;ide, than all the re&s;t; &s;o that we put in at <HI>Madrigale&s;co,</HI> which has not above a do&s;en Hou&s;es, and I may &s;ay we were be&s;ieg'd without having any Enemies. This Adventure gave us &s;ome di&s;turbance, tho' we had brought Provi&s;ions with us for &s;everal Days. The be&s;t Hou&s;e of the Town has half unco|vered; and I was &s;carce lodged there, when a venerable Old Man askt for me on the part of a Lady who was ju&s;t arrriv'd: He made me a Compliment, and told me, He was inform'd this was the only place where there was any tolerable Enter|tainment; and therefore intreated me to &s;pare her &s;ome room. He added, She was a Per&s;on of Quality of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> was lately a Widow, and that he had the Honour to belong to her.</P>
<P>One of our Knights, named <HI>Don E&s;teve de Carjaval,</HI> who is of the &s;ame Country, fail'd not to demand her Name of the old Gentleman: He told him, &s;he was the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Rios.</HI> At this Name he turn'd towards me, and &s;pake to me of her as of a Per&s;on who&s;e Merit and Fortune were very con&s;iderable; I readily accepted of this good Company: She immediately came in her Litter, out of which &s;he had not de|&s;cended, having found no Hou&s;e where &s;he could abide.</P>
<P>Her Dre&s;s &s;eem'd to me very &s;ingular; had &s;he not been &s;o hand&s;ome as &s;he was, &s;he could never have appear'd in any &s;ort tolerable: Her Gown and Petticoat was of black Serge, and over them a kind of Linnen Surplice, which reacht down lower than her Knees; the Sleeves were long, and &s;trait in the Arms, which hung over her Hands: This Surplice was fa&s;tned to her Gown, and being not pleated behind, it &s;eem'd like a Bib: &s;he wore on her Head a piece of Mu&s;lin, which covered
<PB N="60" REF="33"> her Face, and one would have taken it for a Religio&s;e's Hood; this covered her Neck, and reach'd down very low: There appear'd no Hair on her Head, they were all hid under this Mu&s;lin: She wore a great Mantle of black Taffaty, which co|vered her Heels; and over this Mantle &s;he had an Hat, who&s;e Brims were very large, fa&s;tned under her Chin with &s;ilken Twi&s;t. I was told they wear this but only when they travel.</P>
<P>This is the Habit of the Widows and <HI>Duenna's,</HI> a Dre&s;s which is in&s;upportable to my &s;ight; and &s;hould one meet with a Woman in the Night thus cloath'd, one might be &s;tartled without Reproach; yet the Lady was very beautiful in this Un&s;eemly Dre&s;s. They never leave it, unle&s;s they marry; and they are oblig'd to bewail the Death of an Husband, whom they could not endure when living.</P>
<P>I was inform'd they pa&s;s the fir&s;t Year of their Mourning in a Chamber hung with Black, wherein there is not the lea&s;t glimmering of Day-light to be &s;een; they fit cro&s;s-legg'd on a little <HI>Holland</HI>-Quilt. When this Year is ended, they retire in|to a Chamber hung with Gray: they mu&s;t have no Pictures, nor Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, nor Cabinets, nor fine Tables, nor Plate, neither mu&s;t they have any Diamonds, or wear any Colours: However mode&s;t they are, they mu&s;t live &s;o retired, that it mu&s;t &s;eem their Soul is already in the other World. This Con|&s;traint is the cau&s;e that &s;everal Ladies who are wealthy, and e&s;pecially in rich Hou&s;hold-Goods, marry again to have the &s;a|tisfaction of making u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t Compliments, I inform'd my &s;elf from this mournful Widow where &s;he was going; &s;he told me, She had not for a long time &s;een a Friend of her Mother's who was a Religious at <HI>La&s;huelgas de Burgos,</HI> which is a famous Nunnery, wherein there is an hundred and fifty Nuns, mo&s;t of 'em the Daughters of Princes, Dukes and Titulado's. She added, That the Abbe&s;s is Lady of fourteen large Towns, and above fifty other Places, wherein &s;he chu&s;es Governors and Magi&s;trates; that &s;he is Superior of &s;eventeen Convents; Collates to &s;everal Benefices, and di&s;po&s;es of twelve Commander&s;hips in favour of whom &s;he plea&s;es. She told me &s;he de&s;ign'd to pa&s;s &s;ome time in this Mona&s;tery: <HI>Can you, Madam,</HI> &s;aid I to her, <HI>accu&s;tom your &s;elf to &s;o retired a Life as is that of a Convent? It will be no hard matter,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>for I believe I &s;ee fewer People at my own Hou&s;e than I &s;hall &s;ee there; and in effect the&s;e Religious have Liberty enough: They are commonly the hand&s;ome&s;t young Wo|men of the Family who are there; the&s;e enter therein &s;o young, that they know not what they are made to leave, nor what they under|take
<PB N="61" REF="33"> at the Age of &s;ix or &s;even, and it may be &s;ooner. They are cau&s;ed to make Vows, when 'tis often the Father or Mother, or &s;ome near Relation, who pronounce them for 'em, whil&s;t the little Sacrifice di&s;ports her &s;elf with Sugar-plums, and lets 'em dre&s;s her how they will: Yet the Bargain holds, there's no un&s;aying it; however, they have every thing which can be expected in their Con|dition. There are at</HI> Madrid <HI>&s; me whom they call the Ladies of St.</HI> James: <HI>they are properly Canonne&s;&s;es, who make their Try|als like the Knights of this Order; they bear, like them, a Sword made in form of a Cro&s;s, embroidered with Crim&s;on Silk; they have 'em on their Scapularies and great Cloaks, which are white: The&s;e Ladies Hou&s;e is very &s;tately; all who come to vi&s;it 'em enter without any difficulty; their Apartments are very fine, and every whit as well furni&s;h'd as if they were at large in the World; they enjoy great Pen&s;ions, and each of 'em has three or four Women to wait on them: It's true, they never &s;tir out, nor &s;ee their nearest Relations, but through &s;everal Grates. This perhaps would look horrid in another Country, but in</HI> Spain <HI>they are accu&s;tom'd to Con|finement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There are Convents where the Religious &s;ee more Cavaliers than the Women who live at large, neither are they le&s;s gallant; It is impo&s;&s;ible for any to have more Gayety than they; and, as I have already told you, Madam, here are more Beauties than abroad; but it mu&s;t be granted, there are &s;everal among them who are deeply &s;en&s;ible at their having been &s;o &s;oon &s;acrific'd; they think of the Plea&s;ures which they have never tasted, as the only ones which can make this Life Happy. They pa&s;s theirs in a Condition wor|thy of Compa&s;&s;ion, always telling you, they are there by Force; and that the Vows they are made to repeat at the Age of five or &s;ix Years, are to be regarded like Childrens Plays.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid I to her, <HI>it wou'd have been great pity, had your Relations de&s;ign'd you for &s;uch a Life; and one may judge, in be|holding you, that all the beautiful</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Ladies are not Religio&s;es. Alas, Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, in fetching a deep Sigh, <HI>I know not what I wou'd be; it &s;eems I am of a very odd Humor, not to be contented with my Fortune: but one has &s;ometimes &V;nea&s;ine&s;&s;es which are unaccountable to Rea&s;on.</HI> In ending the&s;e words, &s;he fa&s;tned her Eyes to the ground, and fell into &s;uch a deep fit of Mu&s;ing, that I cou'd ea&s;ily perceive &s;omething di&s;turb'd her.</P>
<P>Whatever Curio&s;ity I had to know the Subject, we had been &s;o little together, that I dared not de&s;ire to be her Confident; but to draw her from the melancholy Po&s;ture &s;he was in, I en|treated her to tell me &s;ome News of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;eeing
<PB N="62" REF="34"> &s;he came from <HI>Madrid.</HI> She did what &s;he cou'd to recover her &s;elf: &s;he then told me, There were great &s;hews of Joy at Court on the Queen's Birth-day: that the King had &s;ent one of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to <HI>Toledo,</HI> to Compliment her from him: Yet the&s;e fine Appearances hindred not the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era,</HI> the Queen's <HI>Major Domo,</HI> from receiving Orders to retire twenty Leagues from the Court, which had greatly mortifi'd this Prince&s;s. She inform'd us, That the Fleet which carried Troops to <HI>Galicia,</HI> was unhappily ca&s;t away on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Portugal.</HI> That the little Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> was to E&s;pou&s;e <HI>Don Nicolo Pignatelli,</HI> Prince <HI>de Monte|leon,</HI> her Uncle. That the Marque&s;s <HI>de Laganez</HI> had refu&s;ed the Vice-royalty of <HI>Sardagnia,</HI> being in love with a fine Lady, whom he cou'd not find in his heart to leave. That <HI>Don Carlos de Omodei,</HI> Marque&s;s <HI>d' Almanazid,</HI> was dangerou&s;ly ill, at his Di&s;appointment of being admitted a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> to which he pretended, having marry'd the Heire&s;s of the Hou&s;e and Grandeur&s;hip of <HI>Ca&s;tle Rodrigue;</HI> and that which mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly afflicted him, was, that <HI>Don Ariel de Gu&s;man,</HI> this Lady's fir&s;t Husband, had enjoyed this Honour; &s;o that he cou'd not but look on the Difficulties thrown in his way as a &s;lighting of his Per&s;on: <HI>In truth, Madam,</HI> &s;aid I to her, <HI>I can hardly com|prehend how a Man of &s;ence, can with &s;uch eagerne&s;s pur&s;ue, and be &s;o greatly dejected at a Di&s;appointment of this Nature. We are otherwi&s;e affected in</HI> Spain, replied the beautiful Widow, <HI>and this In&s;tance is a proof of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> who greatly intere&s;ted him&s;elf for the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> askt her News of him: <HI>The King,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>has lately made him Pre&s;ident of the</HI> Indies. <HI>The Queen-Mother has wrote to the King, on the Report which runs, that he is about Marrying; that &s;he is &s;urpriz'd things are already gone &s;o far, and he has not acquainted her with them. She adds in her Letter, She advi&s;ed him in the mean time, whil&s;t all things were ready for this Ceremony, to make a Journey to</HI> Catalonia <HI>and</HI> Arragon. Don John <HI>of</HI> Au&s;tria <HI>&s;ufficiently under&s;tands the Nece&s;&s;ity of this, and he pre&s;&s;es the King to depart, to content the&s;e People, in promi&s;ing by Oath, according as is customary to new Kings, to maintain all their ancient Priviledges. Have then, Madam,</HI> &s;aid I to her, interrupting her, <HI>the</HI> Arrogonois <HI>any other Priviledges than the</HI> Ca&s;tillians? <HI>Very particular ones,</HI> re|plied &s;he, <HI>and you being a Stranger, I believe you will be wil|ling to let me inform you of them.</HI> Here's what I learnt:</P>
<PB N="63" REF="34">
<P>The Daughter of Count <HI>Julien,</HI> named <HI>Cava,</HI> was one of the mo&s;t beautiful Ladies in the World: King <HI>Rodrigue</HI> became &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her, that his Affections knowing no Bounds, tran&s;ported him beyond all mea&s;ure. The Father, who was then in <HI>Affrica,</HI> inform'd of the Outrage done his Daughter, who breath'd nothing but Revenge, treated with the <HI>Moors,</HI> and &s;upplied 'em with the means to enter into <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This hap|pened in <HI>714,</HI> after the Bat|tle of St. <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> wherein <HI>D. Rodrigue</HI> lo&s;t his Life; others &s;ay, he fled into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and died in a Town there call'd <HI>Vi&s;cii.</HI></NOTE> and to make there, for &s;undry Ages, all tho&s;e Ravages &s;et forth at large in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arragonois</HI> were the fir&s;t who &s;hook off the Yoak of the&s;e Barbarians; and finding no more among them any Princes of the Race of the <HI>Gothi&s;h</HI> Kings, they agreed to Elect one, and ca&s;t their eyes on a Lord of the Country, call'd <HI>Garci Ximinex;</HI> but they being Ma&s;ters, to impo&s;e Laws on him, and finding him&s;elf &s;ufficiently Happy that he might Rule over them under any Condition, the&s;e People therefore confin'd him within narrow Bounds.</P>
<P>They agreed, That as &s;oon as their Monarch &s;hou'd break through any of their Laws, he &s;hou'd immediately forfeit his Power, and they be at full liberty to chu&s;e another, though he were a Pagan: and to hinder him from violating their Pri|viledges, and to defend them&s;elves again&s;t him, they e&s;tabli&s;ht a Soveraign Magi&s;trate, whom they call'd the <HI>Ju&s;ticia,</HI> who&s;e Office was to ob&s;erve the Conduct of the King, the Judges, and he People: but the Power of a Soveraign being likely to Awe a meer Particular, to A&s;&s;ure the <HI>Ju&s;ticia</HI> in the Execution of his Office, they ordered, That he might not &s;uffer either in his Per&s;on or Goods, but by a compleat A&s;&s;embly of the States, which they call <HI>Las Cortes.</HI></P>
<P>They moreover provided, That if the King &s;hou'd Oppre&s;s any one of his Subjects, the great and con&s;iderable Men of the Kingdom might a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves, and hinder his receiving any of his Revenues, till the Innocent was acquitted, and re-e&s;tabli&s;ht in his former Rights. And to make <HI>Garci Ximinez</HI> timely &s;en&s;ible of the Power this Man had over him, they &s;et him on a kind of a Throne, and made the King to kneel down bare headed before him, to receive from him his Oath of keep|ing their Priviledges. This Ceremony ended, they acknow|ledge him their Sovereign, but in as odd as di&s;re&s;pectful a
<PB N="64" REF="35"> Manner, for in&s;tead of promi&s;ing him Fidelity and Obedience, they &s;ay to him, <HI>We who are as good Men as your &s;elf we make you our King and Governour, on Condition you keep to us our Rights and Properties, otherwi&s;e we Di&s;acknowledge you.</HI></P>
<P>The King, <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> in proce&s;s of time coming to the Crown, reli&s;ht this Cu&s;tom, as unworthy of the Regal State; and it &s;o greatly di&s;gu&s;ted him, that by his Authority and In|treaties, and the Offers he made of be&s;towing &s;everal notable Priviledges on the Kingdom, he procured the Aboli&s;hment of this, in an A&s;&s;embly of the States: he got this general Con&s;ent in Writing, which was pre&s;ented to him. As &s;oon as he had the Parchment, he drew out his Dagger, and pierced his Hand with it, &s;aying, <HI>'Twas fit a Law which gave Subjects the Liber|ty of chu&s;ing their Sovereign &s;hould be Effaced with their Sove|reign's Blood.</HI> His Statue is &s;till &s;een in the Deputation-Hall of <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a:</HI> he holds a Dagger in one Hand, and the Charter in the other. The late Kings have not been &s;uch Religious Ob|&s;ervers of their Priviledges as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But there is a Law &s;till in force, and which is very &s;ingular, and this they call, <HI>The Law of Manife&s;tation;</HI> which is, That if an <HI>Arragonois</HI> had Wrong done him in Judgment, in con|&s;igning 500 Crowns, he may bring his Cau&s;e before the <HI>Ju&s;ticia,</HI> who is obliged, after an exact Perqui&s;ition, to puni&s;h him who has giv'n a wrong Sentence: And if he fails therein, the op|pre&s;t Per&s;on may have Recour&s;e to the States of the Kingdom, who A&s;&s;emble and Nominate five Per&s;ons of their Body, which is to &s;ay, of the Prime Nobility, the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, the Gen|try and Commonalty: they appoint three out of the fir&s;t Rank, and two from each of the others. But it is ob&s;ervable, they choo&s;e the mo&s;t Ignorant to Judge the mo&s;t able Men in the Gown, whether to Di&s;grace 'em the more for their Fault, or, as they alledge, <HI>That Ju&s;tice &s;hould be &s;o clear, that the very Plow-men, and tho&s;e who under&s;tand the lea&s;t, &s;hould di&s;cern it without the help of Oratory.</HI> It is likewi&s;e affirm'd, That the Judges tremble when they pronounce a Sentence, fearing le&s;t it turn again&s;t them&s;elves, to the lo&s;s of their Lives or E&s;tates, &s;hould they commit the lea&s;t Fault therein, either wilfully, or through Inadvertency. It were well if this Cu&s;tom were ob&s;erved in all Kingdoms: but this is rather to be wi&s;h'd than expected.</P>
<P>Yet what is no le&s;s &s;ingular, is That Ju&s;tice remains always Soveraign; and though the Unju&s;t Judge be puni&s;h'd &s;everely for his wrong Decree, yet it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in its full force, and is fully executed: If then any Unhappy Wretch be &s;entenced to
<PB N="65" REF="35"> Death, he is not &s;pared, tho' his Innocency be di&s;covered, and made as clear as Noon-day; but his Judges are executed too before his Face; which, in my mind, is a poor Con&s;olation. If the Judge accu&s;ed, as ju&s;tly perform'd his Office, the Plain|tiff leaves the 500 Crowns which he had confign'd: But were he to lo&s;e an 100000 Crowns of Annual Revenue, by the Sen|tence he complains of, the Sentence or Decree remains good, and the Judge is only condemn'd to pay him likewi&s;e 500 Crowns; the re&s;t of this Judge's E&s;tate is forfeited to the King: which is, in my Opinion, another Point of Inju&s;tice; for in fine, he ought, above all others, to have Recompence made him who &s;uffers by a wrong Sentence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ame People have another Cu&s;tom, to di&s;tingui&s;h by the Puni&s;hment the Crime committed: for Example, A Cava|lier, who has kill'd another in Duel (for they are here &s;trictly forbid), he has his Head cut off before; and he that has A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated, his is cut off behind.

<P>The Beautiful Marchione&s;s here held her peace; and I re|turn'd her all due Thanks for the Favour &s;he did me, in inform|ing me of the&s;e Curio&s;ities; and of which, perhaps without her, I might have been Ignorant all my Life. <HI>I do not think, Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>you owe me &s;uch Thanks; I rather fear the having de&s;erved Reproaches for &s;o long and tire&s;ome a Conver|&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>I would not let her leave me to eat el&s;ewhere; and I obliged her to lye with me, &s;he having no Bed. So Civil and Cour|teous a Proceeding made her much my Friend.

<P><HI>Seeing you are de&s;irous to know me, I mu&s;t without di&s;gui&s;ing to you any thing, acknowledge my Weakne&s;&s;es to you: and by my Sincerity and Open-heartedne&s;s, de&s;erve a Curio&s;ity as obliging as yours:</HI></P>
<P>I come not of &s;uch a Family as may claim Nobility; my Father's Name was <HI>Davila;</HI> he was only a Banker, but he was in good Credit, and was moderately Wealthy: We are of <HI>Seville,</HI> Capital of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> and we have ever dwelt there. My Mother knew the World, &s;he &s;aw many People of Quality, and having no Children but me, &s;he took great care of my Education: It did not appear ill-be&s;towed on me; for I had the good Fortune to get the good Will of mo&s;t that &s;aw me.</P>
<P>We had two Neighbours who came often to our Hou&s;e, who were very welcome both to my Father and Mother: Their Condition and Age were in no &s;ort alike; One was the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> a Per&s;on Wealthy and Noble; he was a Widower, and well advanced in years: the other was the Son of a great Merchant, who traded to the <HI>Indies;</HI> he was Young and Hand&s;ome, he had Wit, and a very graceful Beha|viour; his Name was <HI>Mendez;</HI> He was not long before he fell pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with me; &s;o that he omitted nothing which might plea&s;e me, and gain my Affections.</P>
<P>He was in all places where he knew I was to pa&s;s; he &s;pent whole Nights under my Windows, to &s;ing Ver&s;es which he had compo&s;ed and &s;et to my Prai&s;e, which he had very well accompany'd with his Harp.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing his Attendancies had not all the Effect he ex|pected, and having pa&s;t &s;ome time in this manner, without daring to mention his Affection to me, he at length re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to acquaint me with it. I avoid-: ed him ever &s;ince I had a Conver&s;ation with one of my Friends, who had more Experience and Knowledge of the World than I: I had felt, that <HI>Mendez's</HI> Company gave me Joy, and that my Heart had an Emotion for him, which it had not for others: That when his Affairs, or our Vi&s;its hindred him from &s;eeing me, I grew re&s;tle&s;s; and loving this young Woman, above
<PB N="68" REF="37"> others, and being as dear to her, &s;he ob&s;erv'd I was not &s;o free and gay as I was wont, and that my Eyes were &s;ometimes at|tentively fixed on <HI>Mendez.</HI> One Day when &s;he rally'd with me about it, I &s;aid to her very innocently, <HI>My dear</HI> Henrieta, <HI>de|fine to me the Sentiments I have for</HI> Mendez: <HI>I know not whe|ther I ought to be afraid of them, and whether I ought not to de|fend my &s;elf from them. I feel I know not what &s;ort of Trouble and Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing in my Brea&s;t.</HI> She began to laugh, &s;he embraced me, and &s;aid to me, <HI>My dear Heart, you are in Love. Who, I in Love?</HI> reply'd I, in amaze: <HI>You joke with me; I nei|ther am, nor will be in Love. This depends not always on us,</HI> con|tinued &s;he, with a more &s;erious Air, <HI>our Stars decide this be|fore our Hearts. But in earne&s;t, what is it &s;o much &s;tartles you?</HI> Mendez <HI>is in a Condition equal to yours; he de&s;erves well, a good comely Man; and if his Affairs go on with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as they have done hitherto, you may live very happily with him. And whence &s;hould I learn,</HI> reply'd I, interrupting her, <HI>that he will be happy with me, and that he &s;o much as thinks this? O, take my Word for it,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>whatever he has done has its De&s;igns; for Men are not wont to pa&s;s Nights under Windows, and the Days in following a Per&s;on for whom they have nothing but Indifferency.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, &s;he left me, and I re&s;olv'd, maugre the Repugnance I felt in me, to give <HI>Mendez</HI> no opportunity of &s;peaking to me in particular.</P>
<P>But one Night as I was walking in the Garden, he came to|wards me: I was perplext to &s;ee my &s;elf alone with him; and he had the opportunity of ob&s;erving it on my Countenance, and in the manner after which I receiv'd him. This could not divert him from the de&s;ign he had of entertaining me: <HI>How Happy am I, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to find you alone? But do I call my &s;elf Happy! Perhaps I know not what I &s;ay: for it may be you will not receive a Secret with which I would entru&s;t you. I am as yet &s;o young,</HI> &s;aid I to him, blu&s;hing, <HI>that I would advi&s;e you to &s;ay nothing to me, unle&s;s you would have me impart it to my Com|panions. Alas,</HI> continued he, <HI>&s;hould I tell you, I adore you; that all my Happine&s;s depends on the Inclinations you have towards me: That I cannot live without &s;ome Certainty, that I may one day plea&s;e you; will you tell this to your Companions? No,</HI> &s;aid, I to him, in great perplexity, <HI>I would look on this Confidence as a Railery, and not believing it my &s;elf, I would not hazard its being left to be believ'd by others.</HI></P>
<PB N="69" REF="37">
<P>We were interrupted as I ended the&s;e words; and he appear'd to me not over-content with the An&s;wer I made him; and a while after he found an opportunity to reproach me with it.</P>
<P>I could not but give a favourable Ear to the Inclinations I had towards him; every thing he told me &s;eem'd to me to have its particular Gracefulne&s;s: And it was no hard matter for him to per&s;wade me, that he lov'd me above all things in the World. In the mean time, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> took &s;uch a liking to me, and my Per&s;on and Behaviour ran &s;o deeply in his Thoughts, that he wholly applied him&s;elf to plea&s;e me. He was very nice and cautious; he could not re&s;olve with him&s;elf to owe me wholly to my Parents Authority: He well knew they would receive as an Honour the Intentions he had for me; but he was for gaining my Con&s;ent before he demanded theirs.</P>
<P>In this De&s;ign he &s;aid all to me he thought was like to take with me. I an&s;wer'd him, I &s;hould always think it an indi&s;|pen&s;able Duty to obey my Father: yet our Ages were &s;o diffe|rent, that I told him, I thought 'twere better he left off think|ing of me; that I &s;hould have an everla&s;ting Acknowledgment for the advantageous Intentions he had for me: and there|fore I would e&s;teem him, tho I could not love him. Ha|ving heard what I &s;aid, he was &s;ome time without &s;peaking, and immediately taking up a very generous Re&s;olution: <HI>Lovely</HI> Mariana, &s;ays he, <HI>you might have made me the happie&s;t Man in the World; and if you were ambitious, I had therewith to &s;atisfie you: But you refu&s;e me, and I de&s;ire to be anothers: I con&s;ent to it; I love you too well to be in &s;u&s;pence, whether you are to be &s;atisfied or I; I therefore wholly &s;acrifice my Happine&s;s to you, and leave you for ever.</HI> In ending the&s;e Words he left me, and appear'd &s;o afflicted, that I could not forbear being con|cern'd.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> arriv'd a while after, and found me melancholly: He was &s;o earne&s;t with me to know the Cau&s;e, that I could not deny him this Proof of my Complai&s;ance. Any one but he would have had a &s;en&s;ible Obligation at the Exclu&s;ion I came from giving his Rival: But far from &s;eeming to value it, he told me, He &s;aw in mine Eyes the Regret I had for a Lover, who could place me in another &s;ort of a Rank than he was able; and that my Proceeding was very Cruel. In vain I endeavour|ed to make him &s;en&s;ible of the Inju&s;tice of his; but all I could &s;ay, could not hinder him from charging me with Incon&s;tancy. I remain'd vext, and &s;urpriz'd at this his way of Dealing, and was &s;everal days without &s;peaking to him.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="38">
<P>He, in fine, at la&s;t under&s;tood he had no Rea&s;on to Com|plain; he came to me, begg'd my Pardon, and te&s;tified to me a great Di&s;plea&s;ure at his own Jealou&s;ie: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf, as all Lovers do, on the &s;trength of his Pa&s;&s;ion. I had &s;o much Weakne&s;s as to be willing to forget the Trouble he had given me: we made up the Matter between us, and he continued on his Court&s;hip.</P>
<P>His Father having under&s;tood the Pa&s;&s;ion he had for me, thought he could not procure him a more advantageous Mar|riage: he took notice of it to him, and came afterwards to my Father, to open to him the Propo&s;al: they had been long Friends; he was favourably heard, and they ea&s;ily agreed on the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> came to inform me of the News, with &s;uch Tran&s;ports as would have &s;eem'd ridiculous to any other than a Mi&s;tre&s;s. My Mother order'd me to look kindly on him, telling me, this Affair would be advantageous to me: and as &s;oon as the <HI>India</HI>-Fleet &s;hould arrive, wherein he was greatly concern'd, the Marriage &s;hould be concluded.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t matters thus pa&s;t, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> had re|tired to one of his Country-Hou&s;es, where he &s;carcely &s;aw any one: He led a langui&s;hing Life; he &s;till lov'd me, but hin|dred him&s;elf from telling me &s;o, and from comforting him&s;elf by this innocent Remedy.</P>
<P>In fine, his Body could not re&s;i&s;t the Heavine&s;s of his Mind; he fell dangerou&s;ly ill, and being told by the Phy&s;icians, there was no hope of his Recovery, he pluckt up his Spirits to write me the mo&s;t affectionate Letter imaginable, and &s;ent at the &s;ame time to me a Deed of Gift of all his E&s;tate, in ca&s;e he dy|ed. My Mother was in my Chamber, when a Gentleman pre|&s;ented this Packet from him; &s;he would know what it con|tain'd.</P>
<P>I could not forbear at the &s;ame time, telling her what had pa&s;t; and we were both of us in the greate&s;t &s;urprize at the Marque&s;s's extream Genero&s;ity. She &s;ent him word, that I &s;hould go with my Family to thank him for a Liberality which I had no ways de&s;erv'd: And in particular, &s;he &s;harply repre|hended me for having made a My&s;tery of a thing to her with which I ought to have immediately acquainted her. I threw my &s;elf at her Feet, I excu&s;ed my &s;elf the be&s;t I could, and te&s;tifi'd &s;uch great Sorrow for having di&s;pleas'd her, that &s;he ea&s;ily pardon'd me. Leaving my Chamber, &s;he went to my Father, and having learnt him all which had pa&s;t, they re&s;olv'd to go the next morning to &s;ee the Marque&s;s, and to carry me with them.</P>

<P>I acquainted <HI>Mendez</HI> with this in the Evening; and the Fear I had, le&s;t my Parents &s;hould, in fine, make me marry this old Man, if he chanced to e&s;cape out of his Sickne&s;s. Howe|ver &s;en&s;ible I appear'd to him of this, he was &s;o far tran&s;|ported, and reproacht me &s;o greatly with it, that I mu&s;t have lov'd him as much as I did, not to have broke off with him: But he had &s;uch an A&s;cendant over me, though he was the Inju&s;te&s;t of all Men, yet I thought him the mo&s;t Rea&s;ona|ble.</P>
<P>We were at the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI>'s; his Country-hou&s;e was not above two Leagues from <HI>Seville:</HI> Dying, as he was, he re|ceiv'd us with &s;uch Joy as was ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable. My Father te&s;ti|fi'd to him his Grief, to &s;ee him in &s;o low a Condition, thankt him for the Donation he made me, and a&s;&s;ured him, If he could find a fair and ju&s;t Pretence, he would break ofs with <HI>Mendez,</HI> to whom he had engaged his Word: That &s;hould this happen, he promi&s;t him &s;olemnly I &s;hould be no Body's but his. He receiv'd this A&s;&s;urance in the &s;ame manner as if he had receiv'd his perfect Felicity; but he knew well the Dolor I conceiv'd thereat: I became Pale, my Eyes were covered with Tears; and when we were about leaving him, he de&s;ired me to draw near to him; he told me with a langui&s;hing Tone: <HI>fear nothing,</HI> Ma|riana; <HI>I love you too well to di&s;plea&s;e you; you &s;hall have</HI> Men|dez, <HI>&s;eeing your Affections are engaged to him.</HI> I an&s;wer'd him: <HI>I had no particular Inclination for him; but being commanded to re&s;pect him, as a Man who was to be my Husband, I could do no otherwi&s;e; however, I intreated him to be well.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;eem'd to me the lea&s;t &s;tep I could take towards a Per&s;on to whom I had &s;o great Obligations. He appear'd thereat &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy'd, attempting to take my Hand and ki&s;s it: <HI>Remember,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>you enjoyn me to live; and that my Life being your Work, you will be oblig'd to con&s;erve it.</HI> We return'd at Night, and the Impatient <HI>Mendez</HI> waited for us, to make me new Reproaches: I took 'em as I was wont, as Proofs of his Pa&s;&s;ion: and having ju&s;tified my &s;elf, I askt him, What News there was of the Fleet? <HI>Alas!</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>my Father has receiv'd &s;uch as drives me to De&s;pair: I dare not inform you.

<P>He te&s;tified all the Acknowledgements he ought me for &s;uch affectionate A&s;&s;urances, and we re&s;olved not to divulge this Ac|cident.</P>
<P>I withdrew very melancholly, and &s;hut my &s;elf up in my Clo&s;et, ruminating on the Con&s;equences of this &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ter.

<P>It would be to abu&s;e your Patience, Madam, to relate to you what&s;oever we &s;aid in this doleful Separation; and though there appear'd no Danger, yet our Hearts had a foreboding of what was afterwards to happen to us. The Day began to ap|pear, and we mu&s;t bid Adieu: I &s;aw him &s;hed Tears, which were accompanied with mine.</P>
<P>I threw my &s;elf on my Bed, rowling a thou&s;and &s;ad Thoughts in my Mind; and I appear'd the next Morning &s;o out of Or|der, that my Father and Mother were afraid I was falling into &s;ome dangerous fit of Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> his Father came to make them a Vi&s;it, to excu&s;e his Son's parting without taking his Leave of them. He added, <HI>He had a Bu&s;ine&s;s which required &s;uch ha&s;te, as would not &s;uffer him a Minute's time at his di&s;po&s;al.</HI> As to my &s;elf, Madam, I was

<P>In the mean time the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> was out of Dan|ger, and my Father went often to &s;ee him: I ob&s;erv'd one day great Alteration on my Mother's Countenance, &s;he and my Fa|ther having been long &s;hut up with Religio&s;es, who came to give 'em a Vi&s;it; and after a Conference of &s;ome time, they call'd me, without my being able to divine the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I entred into their Apartment in &s;uch Di&s;order, that I knew not what I did. One of the&s;e good Fathers, Venerable by his Age and Habit, &s;pake much to me about the Re&s;ignation we owe to the Divine Will, on his Providence, in every thing which relates to us: and the Clo&s;e of his Di&s;cour&s;e was, That <HI>Mendez</HI> was taken by the <HI>Algerines;</HI> that he was a Slave; and by his Misfortunes the&s;e Pyrates had learnt he was a rich Merchant's Son; which had occa&s;ion'd the &s;etting him at an extraordinary Ran&s;om: That they were at <HI>Algiers</HI> in the time he arriv'd; would have willingly brought him along with 'em, but the Money which they had for all, was not &s;ufficient for him alone. That at their Return they had been at his Father's to inform him of this vexatious Di&s;a&s;ter; but found he had ab&s;ented him|&s;elf, and that the lo&s;s of a Galion, on which was embarkt all his Effects, without being able to &s;ave any thing, had induced him to avoid his Creditors, who &s;ought him every-where, to throw him in Pri&s;on. That things being in this Condition, they &s;aw no Remedy to poor <HI>Mendez</HI> his Misfortunes, being in the hands of <HI>Meluza</HI> the mo&s;t famous and covetous of all the Cor&s;aries; and that if I would follow their Advice, and that of my Parents, I would think of taking another Party. I had &s;o far heard this dreadful News in &s;o ec&s;tatic a Condition, that I could only interrupt them by &s;ad Sighs; but when he told me, I mu&s;t think of another Party; I bur&s;t out with Tears and Shrieks, as made both my Father and Mother, and the&s;e Religio&s;es compa&s;&s;ionate me.</P>
<P>I was carried into my Chamber as one nearer death than life; and <HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was &s;ent for, and it was not without great Affliction &s;he beheld me in this &s;ad Condition. I fell in|to a mo&s;t deep Melancholly; I tormented my &s;elf day and night, and nothing was able to remove my dear <HI>Mendez</HI> out of my Mind.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="40">
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> having learnt what had pa&s;t, conceiv'd &s;uch &s;trong Hopes, that he &s;oon found him&s;elf in a Condition to come and Claim of my Father and me the Effect of the Words we had given him. I &s;hewed him that mine were not di&s;engaged in re&s;pect of <HI>Mendez;</HI> that he was Un|fortunate, which no ways le&s;&s;en'd my Engagements to him. He heard me without being per&s;waded by me, and told me, I had the &s;ame de&s;ire of de&s;troying my &s;elf, as others had of &s;aving them&s;elves; that 'twas more my Intere&s;t than his, which made him act as he did. And being ravi&s;ht with having a Pre|tence which &s;eemed to him plau&s;ible, he pre&s;t my Father with &s;uch Earne&s;tne&s;s, that he at length con&s;ented to what he de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to repre&s;ent to you, Madam, in what an Aby&s;s of Sorrow I was in: <HI>What is become my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I to the Marque&s;s, <HI>of that &s;crupulous Tenderne&s;s which hin|der'd you from taking my Heart from any other hand than my own? Let me at lea&s;t have &s;ome time to forget</HI> Mendez; <HI>Perhaps his Ab&s;ence and Misfortunes may prevail on me to &s;ome Indifferency towards him. To this cruel Accident, which has &s;natch'd him &s;o lately from me, you add new Troubles when you expect I &s;hould &s;o &s;peedily pa&s;s over from him to you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I know not what I expect or may hope for,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>but this I am &s;ure of, that my Complai&s;ance had like to have co&s;t me my Life; that if you be not de&s;ign'd for me, you will be anothers; and as to</HI> Mendez, <HI>his Fortune has been &s;uch, that he can no longer pretend to you; and &s;eeing you mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed of, I think you are very hard hearted to refu&s;e me. You cannot be ignorant of what I have done hitherto to plea&s;e you, my former Proceeding &s;hould &s;erve as a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of my future Re&s;pects.</HI></P>
<P>The Marque&s;s made a greater progre&s;s in my Father's Mind than mine. In a Word, my Mother having one day &s;ent for me, told me, 'Twas to no purpo&s;e to u&s;e any longer Delays, my Father being re&s;olv'd I &s;hould obey his Orders. Whatever I could &s;ay to excu&s;e my &s;elf, my Tears, my Remon&s;trances, Entreaties were all to no purpo&s;e, and &s;erv'd only to exa&s;pe|rate my Mother.</P>
<P>All things nece&s;&s;ary were prepared for my Marriage, the Marque&s;s would have every thing &s;uitable to his Quality; He &s;ent me a Cabinet of Jewels and Precious Stones, to the value of &s;everal thou&s;and Crowns. The fatal Day for our Wedding was &s;et. Seeing my &s;elf reduced to this Extremity, I took a re&s;olution which will &s;urpri&s;e you, Madam, and demon&s;trate a great Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="40">
<P>I went to <HI>Donna Henrietta;</HI> this Friend had been ever faith|ful to me, and threw my &s;elf at her feet, &s;urpri&s;ing her by &s;o extraordinary a Carriage: My dear <HI>Henrietta,</HI> &s;aid I to her, melting in Tears, <HI>there is no Remedy to my Misfortunes, unle&s;s you have pity on me; do not abandon me, let me conjure you in the &s;ad Condition I am in; to morrow I mu&s;t marry the Marque&s;s</HI> de Los Rios, <HI>I can no longer avoid it. If the Offers of Friend&s;hip you have made me be Proof again&s;t all Tryal, and can make you capable of a generous Re&s;olution, you will not refu&s;e to follow my Fortune, and to accompany me to</HI> Algiers <HI>to pay</HI> Mendez <HI>his Ran|&s;om, to redeem him from the cruel Slavery he is in. You &s;ee me at your Feet,</HI> continued I, <HI>I will never ri&s;e till you have given me your Word, to do what I de&s;ire you.</HI> She &s;eem'd &s;o concern'd at my Po&s;ture, that I aro&s;e to make her an&s;wer me. She immedi|ately embraced me with great Te&s;timonies of Tenderne&s;s: <HI>I will refu&s;e you nothing, my dear</HI> Mariana, &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>were it my very Life; but you are going to ruine your &s;elf and me with you. How can two Girls execute what you project? Our Age, our Sex, and your Beauty, will expo&s;e us to Accidents, the bare ima|gination of which makes me to tremble: this is certain, we are go|ing to overwhelm our Families with Shame and Confu&s;ion; and if you had made &s;erious Reflections hereon, it is not po&s;&s;ible you could have come to this Re&s;olution. Ah, barbarous!</HI> cried I, <HI>and more barbarous than he that detains my Lover; you for&s;ake me, but tho' I am alone, yet that &s;hall not hinder me from pur&s;uing my Point, neither can the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you &s;hould give me stand me in much stead: Remain, remain, I con&s;ent, it is fit I &s;hould depart without any Comfort to affront all Dangers; I confe&s;s &s;uch an un|dertaking is fit only for a de&s;perate Creature.</HI></P>
<P>My Reproaches and Tears moved <HI>Henrietta;</HI> &s;he told me my Intere&s;t had obliged her as much as her own to &s;peak to me as &s;he had done; but in &s;hort, &s;eeing I per&s;i&s;ted in my fir&s;t Re|&s;olution, and nothing could divert me from it, &s;he was re&s;ol|ved I &s;hould not go alone; That if I would be ruled by her, we &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e our &s;elves; that &s;he would undertake to get two Suits of Mens Apparel; and as for the re&s;t, it belong'd to me to take care of it. I embraced her with a thou&s;and Te&s;timonies of Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I afterwards askt her, Whether &s;he had &s;een the Jewels which the Marque&s;s had &s;ent me; <HI>I will bring them,</HI> &s;aid I to her, <HI>to purcha&s;e</HI> Mendez<HI>'s Ran&s;om with them.</HI> We re&s;olv'd to lo&s;e no time, and we neither of us fail'd in what we had pro|jected.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="41">
<P>Never were two Maidens better di&s;gui&s;ed under the Habit of two Cavaliers. We parted that Night, and embarkt, our &s;elves without the lea&s;t Ob&s;tacle, but after &s;ome days Sail we were overtaken by &s;o violent a Storm, as made us de&s;pair of our Safety. In all this Di&s;order and Peril, I was le&s;s concern|ed for my &s;elf, than for not having compa&s;&s;ed my dear <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Liberty, and for having engaged <HI>Henrietta</HI> to follow my ill For|tune: <HI>It is I,</HI> &s;aid I to her, in embracing her, <HI>it is I, my dear Companion, that has rais'd this Storm, were I not on the Sea it would be Calm; my Misfortune follows me wherever I go.</HI> In fine, we having been a Day and two Nights in continual Alarums, the Weather chang'd, and we arriv'd at <HI>Algiers.</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;o glad to &s;ee my &s;elf in a Condition to deliver <HI>Mendez,</HI> that I reckon'd all the Dangers we underwent as nothing: But alas, what became of me in di&s;embarking, when after all the &s;earch which could be made, I perceiv'd there was no hope of finding the little Cabinet wherein I had put all I had was mo&s;t precious: I found my &s;elf &s;eiz'd with &s;uch violent Grief, that I thought I &s;hould have expired before I got out of the Ve&s;&s;el. Without doubt this Cabinet, which was little, and of which I took but &s;mall Care during the Tempe&s;t, fell into the Sea, or was &s;tole, which ever of the&s;e two it was, I had a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s, and I had only remaining Jewels to the value of a thou&s;and Pounds, which I had kept for all Events about me.</P>
<P>I re&s;olv'd with this, to make a Tryal with <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Patron: As &s;oon as we were in the Town, we enquired out his Hou&s;e, (for <HI>Meluza</HI> was well known) and went thither clad as Gentle|men.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s to you, Madam, the trouble I was in draw|ing near this Hou&s;e, where I knew my dear Lover langui&s;ht in Chains; what &s;ad Reflections did I not make; how did I look when I enter'd the Cor&s;ary's Hou&s;e, and &s;aw <HI>Mendez</HI> Chain'd, with &s;everal others, who were leading out to work in the Field. I &s;hould have fallen at his Feet, had not <HI>Henrietta</HI> born me up: I no longer knew where I was, nor what I did; I would have &s;poken to him, but Grief had &s;o &s;eiz'd on my Spirits, that my Tongue could not utter a Word. As to him, he beheld me not; he was &s;o &s;ad and depre&s;t, that he could look on no body; and one mu&s;t love him as much as I did, to know him, &s;o great|ly was he changed.</P>
<P>After having been &s;ome time coming to my &s;elf, I went into a low Room, where I was told <HI>Meluza</HI> was; I &s;aluted him, and told him the occa&s;ion of my Voyage; that <HI>Mendez</HI> was my near
<PB N="77" REF="41"> Relation; that he was undone by the Lo&s;s of a Galion, and his Captivity together; and that 'twas out of my own Money that I would pay his Ran&s;om. The <HI>Moor</HI> appear'd to me little con|cern'd at what I &s;aid; and looking &s;cornfully on me, he an|&s;wer'd, It was not his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire whence I had my Money; but this he certainly knew, that <HI>Mendez</HI> was Rich; and to &s;hew that he would not take all Advantages, he would therefore &s;et him at twenty thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>Alas, what would this have been, had I not lo&s;t my Jewels? but this was too much in the Condition I was in. In fine, af|ter &s;everal long fruitle&s;s Di&s;putes, I took on me immediately a re&s;olution which could only be in&s;pired by an extream Love.</P>
<P><HI>Here's all I have,</HI> &s;aid I to the Pyrate, in giving him my Diamonds, <HI>they are not worth what thou demande&s;t: take me for thy Slave, and be per&s;waded thou wilt not keep me long. I am the only Daughter of a Rich Banker of</HI> Seville; <HI>keep me for an Ho&s;tage, and let</HI> Mendez <HI>go; he will &s;oon return to Redeem me.</HI> The <HI>Barbarian</HI> was &s;urpriz'd to find me capable of &s;o generous and affectionate a Re&s;olution. <HI>Thou art worthy,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>of a better Fortune. Be it &s;o; I accept the Condition you offer me: I will take care of thee, and be a good Patron to thee. Thou mu&s;t leave the Habit thou weare&s;t, to put on one agreeable to thy Sex: thou &s;halt keep thy Jewels if thou wilt, I can as well &s;tay for the whole as for a part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was &s;o confu&s;ed and di&s;mayed at the Bargain I came from concluding, that &s;he could not &s;ufficiently expre&s;s her Di&s;plea&s;ure to me; but in fine, maugre all her Remon|&s;trances and Entreaties, I held firm, and <HI>Meluza</HI> caus'd a Slave's Habit to be brought me, which I put on.</P>
<P>He conducted me to his Wives Chamber, to whom he de|liver'd me, having recounted to her what I had done for my Lover's Liberty.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd to be much effected with it, and promis'd &s;he would &s;horten the time of my Servitude by all the good Treat|ments &s;he could make me.</P>
<P>At Night, when <HI>Mendez</HI> return'd, <HI>Meluza</HI> caus'd him to be call'd, telling him, That being of <HI>Seville,</HI> he would there|fore &s;hew him a Slave he had bought, becau&s;e perhaps he might know her.</P>
<P>Immediately I was brought before him; <HI>Mendez</HI> at this &s;ight, lo&s;ing all Countenance, came and ca&s;t him&s;elf at my Feet, and taking my Hands, which he bathed with his Tears, he &s;aid every thing which was mo&s;t tender and affectionate to me.
<PB N="78" REF="42"> <HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife diverted them&s;elves, in &s;eeing the diffe|rent Motions of Joy and Grief with which we were agitated: in fine, they inform'd <HI>Mendez</HI> of the Obligations he had to me; that he was free, and that I would remain in his place. He did whatever could be done to di&s;&s;wade me from taking this Task on me: <HI>Alas,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>you would have me load you with my Chains, my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s; Shall I be free, when you are not? I go then to do for you what you come from doing for me; I will &s;ell my &s;elf, and Redeem you with this Money: for in fine, con&s;ider, that &s;hould I as &s;oon as I arrive at</HI> Seville, <HI>find A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and return again to bring you back, yet how is it po&s;&s;ible for me in the mean time to leave you; judge how I can do this in a time wherein my Fortune promi&s;es me nothing, and am the most &V;nhap|py of all Men.</HI> I offered again&s;t all his Rea&s;ons, the Tenderne&s;s of my Father, who would &s;oon Redeem me when he knew where I was. In fine, I made u&s;e of all the Power I had over his Mind, to make his Advantage of what I had done in his Fa|vour.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay to you, Madam, of our Separation? It was &s;o dolorous, that Words cannot expre&s;s what we felt. I ob|liged <HI>Henrietta</HI> to part with him, to &s;ollicite and pre&s;s my Parents to do their part in my behalf.</P>
<P>In the mean time my Father and Mother were in an uncon|ceivable Affliction and when they perceiv'd my flight, they thought to die with Grief.</P>
<P>They blamed them&s;elves infinitely for forcing me to marry the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios.</HI> He was for his part in no le&s;s De&s;pair; they cau&s;ed me to be &s;earcht for in vain, in all places where they thought I might have hid my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Two whole Years were pa&s;t without my receiving any News or Succors from <HI>Mendez;</HI> which made me believe with great likelihood, that both he and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were ca&s;t away on the Sea: I had given them all the Jewels which <HI>Meluza</HI> had left me; but it was not their Lo&s;s, nor that of my Liberty, which I regretted: It was of my dear Lover and faithful Friend, who&s;e Remembrance continually po&s;&s;e&s;t me, and caus'd me an unparallel'd Affliction; I could get no Re&s;t nor Health; I wept Day and Night; I refu&s;ed to come out of my Slavery in neg|lecting to &s;ignifie to my Father my pre&s;ent Condition. I wi&s;ht only for a &s;peedy Death, which I would have willingly met with, to put an end to my Troubles and Misfortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife began to pity me: they did not doubt but <HI>Mendez,</HI> was ca&s;t away: they treated me le&s;s cruelly, than the&s;e &s;ort of People are wont to u&s;e tho&s;e Unhappy Wretches, who fall into their Hands.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="42">
<P>One Day, as <HI>Meluza</HI> came from Pyrating he brought with him &s;everal Per&s;ons of both Sexes which he had taken, and among the re&s;t a Young Woman of &s;ome Quality of <HI>Seville,</HI> and whom I knew. This &s;ight renewed my Grief: &s;he was much &s;urpris'd to find me in this &s;ad place. We affectionately embraced one another, and ob&s;erving a deep &s;ilence; <HI>How now, Beautiful</HI> Mariana, &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>are you &s;o indifferent towards your Relations and Country, that you have no Curio&s;ity to make any Enquiries about them?</HI> I lifted up mine Eyes to Heaven in uttering a deep Sigh; I entreated her to tell me, If 'twere known where <HI>Mendez</HI> and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were lo&s;t? <HI>Who has told you they are lo&s;t?</HI> replied &s;he, <HI>they are at</HI> Seville, <HI>where they lead a very happy Life.</HI> Mendez <HI>has re-e&s;tabli&s;ht his Affairs, and makes it his great Delight and Honour to publi&s;h in all places the Extream Obligations he has to</HI> Henrietta. <HI>Perhaps you are igno|rant,</HI> continued &s;he, <HI>that</HI> Mendez <HI>was taken and made a Slave by the</HI> Algerines; <HI>this generous young Woman di&s;gui&s;ed her &s;elf, and came hither to redeem him, but he has not been ungrateful, for he has married her. There is a mo&s;t charming &V;nion between them.</HI> Hymen <HI>has not bani&s;ht Love in their particular.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;he was yet &s;peaking, &s;he perceiv'd my Countenance to alter on a &s;udden, and that I was ready to faint; my Strength fail'd me, mine Eyes clo&s;ed, and I &s;unk down between her Arms; &s;he was greatly troubled at this; &s;he called my Compa|nions, who put me to Bed, and endeavour'd to recover me from this pitious Condition.</P>
<P>This young Woman greatly concern'd her &s;elf for me; and when I came to my &s;elf, I began to complain; I uttered Sighs and Groans, able to move a Rock.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> was affected at the Recital of &s;uch a wor&s;e than bar|barous In&s;tance of Treachery, and without any notice to me, he inform'd him&s;elf, by his new Slave of my Father's Name, and immediately wrote to him what he knew of my Misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters were like to have been the Death of my Mo|ther, &s;he could not imagine I could be in Chains at eighteen Years of Age, without &s;hedding a torrent of Tears: But that which augmented her Grief, was, the Di&s;order of my Father's Affairs; &s;everal con&s;iderable Bankrupts had ruined him; his Credit was gone, and it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to procure the 20000 Crowns which <HI>Meluza</HI> demanded for my Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The Generous Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> heard this News, came to my Father, and offered him what lay in his Power: <HI>I do not do this,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in de&s;ign to force your Daughter's Inclinations
<PB N="80" REF="43"> when &s;he &s;hall be here; I &s;hall love her always, but I will never di&s;plea&s;e her.</HI> My Father having no other way of Relief, thank|fully accepted of what was offered him; and in a word, em|barkt him&s;elf, and happily arriv'd at <HI>Argiers,</HI> in the time when I thought only of dying.</P>
<P>He forbore all tho&s;e Reproaches I de&s;erv'd; he redeem'd me, and at my Intreaty, this young Woman of <HI>Seville,</HI> for a mo|derate Ran&s;om. We return'd together, and my Mother re|ceiv'd me with &s;uch Joy as is impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;t. I an|&s;wer'd hereto as much as was po&s;&s;ible; but I carried always in my Heart, Madam, the fatal Stroke which had wounded me: Whatever my Rea&s;on could repre&s;ent to me, was not &s;ufficient to eface out of my Remembrance the Image of the Traitor <HI>Mendez.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios:</HI> he dared not mention the Inclinations he &s;till had towards me; but I had &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Obligations to him, that Gratitude made me do for him, what my Inclinations would have made me do for another.</P>
<P>I gave him my Hand, and he his to me, with &s;uch Affection, as if he had had no &s;olid Matter of Complaint again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In fine, I married him, and apprehending le&s;t I &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Mendez,</HI> that Ungrateful Wretch, to whom I owe &s;uch Hor|rour, and for whom I had &s;o little, I pray'd the Marque&s;s we might dwell in the Country-hou&s;e he had near <HI>Seville.</HI></P>
<P>He ever approv'd of what I liked; he would have my Father and Mother retire; he le&s;s'ned the &s;ad Condition of their Fortune, by con&s;iderable Liberalities: and I may truly &s;ay, there never was a greater Soul. Judge, Madam, of all the Reproaches I made my Heart for its not being &s;o tender to him as it ought to have been: It was not in my power to forget <HI>Mendez,</HI> and I always felt new Regrets, when I learnt his Feli|city with the Unfaithful <HI>Henrietta.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;t two Years in a continual watching over my &s;elf, that I might do nothing but what was agreeable to my Husband, Heaven depriv'd me of him, of this Generous Hus|band; and he did for me in the&s;e la&s;t Moments, what he had already heretofore done, giving me all he had, with &s;uch Te&s;timonies of E&s;teem and Affection, as much enhanced the Price of the Gift: He made me the riche&s;t Widow of <HI>Anda|lou&s;ia,</HI> but he could not make me the Happie&s;t.</P>
<P>I would not return to <HI>Seville,</HI> where my Parents would have had me been; and to avoid it, I pretended a Journey farther into the Country, to look after &s;ome part of my E&s;tate. I &s;et out; but there being a particular Fatality in whatever relates
<PB N="81" REF="43"> to me, in arriving at an Inn, the fir&s;t Object which &s;truck my &s;ight, was the Unfaithful <HI>Mendez:</HI> he was in deep Mourning, and had lo&s;t nothing of whatever made me here|tofore fancy him too Lovely. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Condition I was in, for endeavouring to get &s;peedily from him, I found my &s;elf &s;o weak and trembling, that I fell at his Feet. Although he knew me not at that in&s;tant, yet he earne&s;tly en|deavour'd to rai&s;e me up; but the great Veil under which I was conceal'd, flying open, what became of him in &s;eeing me? He remain'd no le&s;s confu&s;ed than I was: he would have drawn near to me, but ca&s;ting a furious Look on him: <HI>Dare&s;t thou, Perjured Wretch!</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>dare&s;t thou approach me! Art thou not afraid of the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of thy Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> He was &s;ome time without an&s;wering me, and I was about leaving him when he &s;topt me: <HI>Confound and over-whelm me with Reproaches, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to me: <HI>Give me the wor&s;t and most perfidious Names as is po&s;&s;ible; they cannot be more than I de&s;erve: But my Death &s;hall &s;oon revenge your Quarrel: I ought to die with Sorrow for having betray'd you; and if I regret any thing in dying, it is only the having one Life to lo&s;e, to expi|ate all the Crimes you can ju&s;tly accu&s;e me of.</HI> He appear'd to me much affected in ending the&s;e words; and would to Heavens his Repentance were really &s;ufficient and true! I would not hazard a longer Conver&s;ation with him: I left him, di&s;dain|ing to return him an An&s;wer. And this Mark of Contempt and Slighting, was, without doubt, more &s;en&s;ible to him, than all the Reproaches I might have made him.</P>
<P>He had &s;ome time &s;ince lo&s;t his Wife, that Unfaithful Crea|ture, who had helpt him to Revolt again&s;t all the Offices of Love, Honour, and Gratitude. And from that time he fol|low'd me every-where: he was like a Complaining Shadow, ever fa&s;tned to my Feet; for he became &s;o lean, pale, and chang'd, that he was no longer di&s;cernable. Heavens! Ma|dam, what Violence did I not offer my &s;elf, in continuing to ill Treat him: I found at la&s;t I wanted Strength to re&s;i&s;t the Weakne&s;s of my Heart, and the A&s;cendant this Wretch had o|ver me. Rather than to commit &s;o &s;hameful an Offence, and to Forgive him, I parted for <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I have Relations, and &s;ought among them a Shelter again&s;t the Violence of mine own Inclinations.</P>
<P>I was not there long but <HI>Mendez</HI> found me out: I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s to you, I was not heartily di&s;pleas'd at his Attendance on me; but maugre my Inclinations towards him, I put on a firm Re&s;olution to avoid him, &s;eeing I could not &s;incerely hate
<PB N="82" REF="44"> him; and unknown to every Body, I took the Road to <HI>Burgos'</HI> where I am going to Cloy&s;ter my &s;elf with a Religious there, my Friend. I flatter my &s;elf, Madam, with the Hopes of finding more Re&s;t there, than I have hitherto met with.</P>
<P>The Beautiful Marchione&s;s here held her peace; and I te&s;ti|fied to her my particular Acknowledgments for the Favour &s;he had done me: I a&s;&s;ured her of the part I took in her Adven|tures: I conjured her to write to me, and to let me hear from her at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and &s;he promi&s;ed it me in the mo&s;t obliging manner as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We found the next Morning we could not &s;et out, it having &s;now'd all the Night, and no Path appearing on the Ground; but we wanted not Company to pa&s;s the time in Play and Di&s;|cour&s;e. Having been three days with the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> without any Wearine&s;s at the length of the Time, through the plea&s;ure I had of &s;eeing and hearing her talk, (for &s;he is one of the mo&s;t lovely Women in the World:) We parted with a mutual Regret, and it was not without doubling our Promi&s;es of writing to, and &s;eeing one another hereafter.</P>
<P>The Weather mended, and I continued on my Journey to <HI>Lerma:</HI> We had traver&s;t dreadful Mountains, which bear the Name of <HI>Sierra de Cogollos,</HI> and it was not without great trou|ble we got thither: This Town is &s;mall; &s;he has given her Name to the famous Cardinal <HI>de Lerma,</HI> Chief Mini&s;ter to <HI>Philip</HI> III: it is from him that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. took the great Reve|nues he had receiv'd from the King his Ma&s;ter. Here is a Ca&s;tle which I will &s;ee to Morrow, and of which I &s;hall give you an Account in my next, I am told an Extraordinary Expre&s;s is arriv'd, and will &s;et out to Night: I will lay hold of this Op|portunity of &s;ending to you, and ending this long Letter; for in truth I am tired both with the Way, and with Writing, but I &s;hall never be weary of Loving you.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF A Voyage to <HI>SPAIN,</HI> IN <HI>Several Letters.</HI> PART. II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER. V.</HEAD>
<P>MY La&s;t was &s;o long, and I was &s;o weary when I ended it, that I could not add &s;ome Particulars, which probably might not have been unwelcome to you. I proceed then (dear Kin&s;woman) ro re|count them, &s;eeing you &s;o much de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>I arrived late at <HI>Lerma,</HI> and re&s;olved to tarry &s;ome time to &s;ee the Ca&s;tle, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o highly e&s;teem, that they prize it next the <HI>E&s;curial;</HI> and it is indeed a very fine place. The Cardinal <HI>de Lerma, Philip</HI> the Third's Favorite, was its Founder. It &s;tands on the &s;ide of an Hill, and in your way to it you mu&s;t pa&s;s through a &s;pacious place, &s;urrounded with Arches and Galleries about it. This Ca&s;tle con&s;i&s;ts of four va&s;t Piles of building, which makes a compleat Quadrangle of two Ranges of Porches within the Court, which are near as high as
<PB N="84" REF="45"> the Roof, and hinder the Apartments from Pro&s;pects on that &s;ide. The Windows of all the Chambers look forward into the Country; the Rooms are &s;pacious, and the Lodgings very fine and curiou&s;ly gilt. There are a prodigious number of them, and very well furni&s;h't. Near the Ca&s;tle you have a great Park which extends it &s;elf along the Plain, through which runs a Ri|ver, and &s;everal le&s;&s;er Springs: On the &s;ide of the River, there are rows of great Trees, and not far hence a Wood, &s;o that, I believe, in fine weather this is a delightful place.</P>
<P>The Keeper of the Ca&s;tle ask't me, whether I would &s;ee the Religio&s;es, who&s;e Convent is adjoyning thereunto. I told him mo&s;t willingly; &s;o that he made us pa&s;s through a Gallery, at the end of which you meet with a Grate which reaches from top to bottom. The Abbe&s;s, having been adverti&s;ed of it, came here with &s;everal Religio&s;es, who were very entertaining, hand&s;om, witty and young, and di&s;cour&s;ing with great exactne&s;s of every thing. I was not weary of their Conver&s;ation, when a young Girl came and whi&s;pered the Abbe&s;s in the Ear, who afterwards told me there was a Lady of great Quality, who had retired in|to their Hou&s;e, being the Daughter of Don <HI>Mandrica de Lara,</HI> Count <HI>de Valine,</HI> and elde&s;t Son to the Duke <HI>de Naxara;</HI> That &s;he was Widow of Don <HI>Franci&s;co Fernandez de Castro,</HI> Count <HI>de Lemos,</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke <HI>de Taure&s;ano;</HI> that when &s;he knew of <HI>French</HI> Ladies pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Lerma,</HI> &s;he was great|ly de&s;irous of Entertaining them. I made an&s;wer, I &s;hould be glad of the honour of &s;eeing her: Whereupon this young Girl was &s;ent to her.</P>
<P>This Lady &s;oon came in a Dre&s;s u&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> this hundred years; &s;he had a kind of Pattins on, or rather Stilts, which made her look prodigious Tall, &s;o that &s;he was fain to lean on two per&s;ons &s;houlders when &s;he moved. She leaned likewi&s;e on two Daughters of the Marquis <HI>del Carpio;</HI> one of them is of a very fair Complexion, which is rare in this Coun|try, and the others Hair is as black as Jet. Their Beauty &s;ur|priz'd me, and they wanted only, in my mind, to be a little fat. But this is not reckon'd a Defect in this Country, where they fancy leanne&s;s &s;o much, that they de&s;ire only to have Skin and Bone. The &s;ingular Dre&s;s of the Counte&s;s <HI>de Lemos,</HI> ap|peared to me &s;o extraordinary, that I could hardly get mine eyes off of it. She wore a kind of black Sattin Gold embroider|ed Bodice, and buttoned with great Rubies of con&s;iderable value. This Bodice came down from her Neck ju&s;t like a Doublet; her Sleeves were &s;trait, with large Wings about her &s;houlders, and other Sleeves hanging as low as her Gown, which
<PB N="85" REF="45"> were fa&s;tned on each &s;ide with Ro&s;es of Diamonds; She had a dreadful Virdingal, which hindred her from &s;itting, other|wi&s;e then on the Ground. She wore a Ruff, and &s;everal Chains of great Pearls and Diamonds; her Hair was white, which &s;he hid under a Coverture of black Lace, for &s;he was no le&s;s than 75 years old. She &s;eem'd to me to have been a great Beauty in her time; her face had not a wrinkle, and her eyes were &s;till &s;parkling, and her white and red Paint became her very well: Her Wit and her Per&s;onage, as I have been told, were not a little famous in the World. I lookt upon her as a curi|ous Piece of Antiquity.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had the honour to Accompany the Infanta when &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth. That &s;he became ac|quainted with the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> when he was in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> came thither. You have &s;een this Queen, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her,</HI> be plea&s;ed, Madam, to favour me with a Relation of &s;ome Particulars of her humor.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ent Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel</HI> in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> to di&s;cover, as much as in him lay, the Intentions of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> They had been long Enemies to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria,</HI> and it was not doubted but they would make new Attempts to thwart it, in the de&s;ign of making the Emperour's Son King of the <HI>Romans; Pimentel</HI> was charged to carry on this Affair with great Circum&s;pection. He was a gallant, witty and hand&s;ome Per&s;on, and he &s;ucceeded better than could be expected. He immediately di&s;covered the Queen's <HI>Genius,</HI> and ea&s;ily made him&s;elf her Confident. He &s;oon perceived &s;he was mightily charm'd with Novelties, and that of the crowd of Strangers which &s;he drew to the Court, the la&s;t come was the mo&s;t fa|voured. He made it his Task to plea&s;e her, and gained &s;o far on her Affections, that he became inform'd by her &s;elf of the mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs, and which &s;he ought the mo&s;t to conceal from him. But what cannot he do, who has found a way to the heart. The Queen's was &s;o inclined to him, that he became the &s;ole Di&s;po&s;er of the Affections of this Prince&s;s, and by this means was able to write to the Emperour, and to the Electors, things &s;o certain and agreeable, as made 'em ea&s;ily judge that the Queen of <HI>Sweedland</HI>'s Council had no part in the Declaration &s;he made in favour of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>This Intrigue being at an end, 'twas thought the King would recal <HI>Pimentel,</HI> there appearing no occa&s;ion requiring the Pre|&s;ence of an Amba&s;&s;ador: But if it were needle&s;s for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> that he &s;hould remain at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> 'twas not the &s;ame
<PB N="86" REF="46"> with the Queen, &s;he neglecting nothing whereby to retain him near her. He attended her wherever &s;he went &s;ince, and many, who were led by outward Appearances, judged when &s;he left the Crown to her Co&s;in, &s;he did it with great Satisfaction, be|cau&s;e &s;he did it with dry Eyes, and had the Courage to harangue the States with great Force and Eloquence; but the People were greatly mi&s;taken in the &s;ecret Motives of this Prince&s;s. Her &s;oul at that time was pierced with the mo&s;t lovely &s;orrow; &s;he was not a little griev'd to yield to the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> a Scepter which &s;he thought her &s;elf worthy to wield alone, and of which &s;he was the lawful Heire&s;s.</P>
<P>This Prince had the Addre&s;s to get it declared, that if &s;he married &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e him for her Husband.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as this Declaration was made, &s;he began to feel the weight of the &s;ubjection wherein &s;he was placed; and on the other hand, the People did not well reli&s;h the being governed by a Woman. They in&s;i&s;ted more on her Defects than they minded her Vertues. The Prince contributed under-hand thereto, and the Queen, who was penetrating &s;oon per|ceiv'd it; &s;he ob&s;erv'd the Inclination the People had to him, and the wi&s;hes which were made to &s;ee him on the Throne; &s;he grew every day more and more jealous of this, and pa&s;t from hence to &s;uch a deadly Hatred, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;top the Cour&s;e of it. The Princes pre&s;ence became &s;o in&s;upportable to her, that perceiving it, he withdrew into an I&s;land which belong'd to him. But he &s;et not out till he had left good <HI>Memoires</HI> to his Creatures again&s;t the Queen's Con|duct.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;aw her &s;elf deliver'd from an Object, who&s;e &s;ight was &s;o great an Eye-&s;ore, &s;he drew off her Mind from the too intent pur&s;uit of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and gave way to her Inclinations to Books. Her marvellous Wit made, in a &s;hort time, admirable Progre&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t profound Scien|ces; but the&s;e were not &s;o needful to her as a good Conduct in the management of her Honour and Intere&s;t. It often hap|pens, that having &s;pent &s;everal days in her Study, &s;he would appear di&s;gu&s;ted with her Books, &s;aying, They were good for nothing but to wa&s;te the Spirits, and mi&s;lead Mens Judgments. When the Great Men of the Court &s;aw her in this Di&s;po&s;ition, they approacht her with more familiarity, and then the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was to follow the Plea&s;ures of Love, of Plays, Balls, Turneys, Huntings, and all other Diver&s;ions. She gave up her &s;elf entirely to them, and nothing cou'd bring her off them; but &s;he added to this Defect that of enriching Strangers, at the Expence of her own Subjects.</P>
<PB N="87" REF="46">
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> began to murmur at this; the Queen was ad|verti&s;ed of it; their Complaints appear'd to be unju&s;t, and little re&s;pectful; and being not a little offended at them, &s;he was &s;o unwi&s;e as to take Vengeance on her &s;elf. In effect, at the time when 'twas lea&s;t expected, and when &s;he was in a Con|dition to find le&s;s violent Remedies, &s;he abandoned at one &s;troak her Crown and Kingdom to her Co&s;in; to this Co&s;in, I &s;ay, whom &s;he was &s;o far from loving, that &s;he wi&s;h'd him all the ill &s;he was able; and yet to whom &s;he did &s;o much good, &s;he thought 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for any to penetrate into the Mo|tives of this. She pretended by this great &s;troak of Genero&s;i|ty, to di&s;tingui&s;h her &s;elf from among the Heroina's of the mo&s;t famous Ages: But in effect, the Conduct &s;he held afterwards, di&s;tingui&s;h'd her only to her Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>She was &s;een to &s;et out from <HI>Swedeland</HI> in a very odd Dre&s;s for a Woman, with a kind of Ju&s;taucorps, a &s;hort Petticoat, with Boots and Cravat, in a Perriwig, a Hat covered with Feathers, and this Perriwig tied up in a lock behind which &s;eem'd then very ridiculous. She forbad all her Women to fol|fow her, choo&s;ing only Men to &s;erve her, and attend her. She was wont ordinarily to &s;ay, That &s;he did not love Men as Men, but becau&s;e they were not Women. So that &s;he &s;eem'd to have renounc'd her Sex in renouncing her States, altho &s;he had &s;ometimes &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es as wou'd have made the meane&s;t Women a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>The tru&s;ty <HI>Pimentel</HI> pa&s;t over into <HI>Flanders</HI> with her, and I being then there, <HI>continues &s;he,</HI> I &s;aw him arrive; he procu|red me the honour to ki&s;s her hand, and there needed no le&s;s than his Credit to obtain this; for &s;he &s;ent word to all the Ladies of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Antwerpt,</HI> &s;he wou'd excu&s;e them for their Vi&s;its. Yet &s;he receiv'd me very well, and the little &s;he &s;aid to me, appear'd full of Wit and extraordinary Vivacity; but &s;he &s;wore at every turn like a Souldier, and her Words and Acti|ons were &s;o free, not to &s;ay &s;o di&s;hone&s;t, that were it not for her Rank, her Per&s;on wou'd have been little regarded.</P>
<P>She &s;pake before every Body of the pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire &s;he had to &s;ee the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> that his great Actions had charm'd her, and that &s;he was de&s;irous to learn the Trade of War under him. The Prince had no le&s;s de&s;ire to &s;ee her, than &s;he te&s;tified to &s;ee him. In the mid&s;t of this mutual Impati|ence, the Queen &s;topt on a &s;udden on &s;ome Formalities and Steps which &s;he refu&s;ed to take, when he &s;hou'd come to &s;a|lute her. The&s;e Rea&s;ons hindred him from &s;eeing her with the u&s;ual Ceremonies. But one day, when the Queen's Chamber
<PB N="88" REF="47"> was full of Courtiers, the Prince &s;lipt therein; whether &s;he had &s;een his Picture, or that his Martial Ayr had di&s;tingui&s;h'd him from among others, &s;he had &s;ingled him out, and knew him. She wou'd immediately hereupon have te&s;tifi'd as much to him, by extraordinary Civilities. He pre&s;ently retired, and &s;he follow'd to conduct him. Then he &s;topt, and content|ed him&s;elf with &s;aying the&s;e words, <HI>Either All, or Nothing.</HI> Some few days after, an Interview was &s;et on foot to be be|tween them in the <HI>Mall</HI> in the Park at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where they &s;pake together with great Civility and much Coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel,</HI> the Favours &s;he has had for him, have, made noi&s;e enough to come to your Ears, and if you be ignorant of 'em, Madam, I believe I ought not to un|dertake to learn you the Particulars, of which perhaps I my &s;elf may have been ill inform'd. She held her peace, and I made my profit of this moment to thank her for complai&s;ance in giving me an account of a Queen, who had ever giv'n me &s;uch a great Curio&s;ity. She askt me afterwards, whether I had &s;een the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lerma.</HI> He that build it, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> was Fa|vorite to <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, who&s;e Death hapned very &s;trange|ly. This Prince, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> was writing Letters in his Clo|&s;et, and it being very cold that day, they had placed very near him a quick fire of Coals, who&s;e reverberation &s;truck &s;o much on his face, that he was all in water, as if a great quanti|ty of it had been poured on his Head. The ea&s;ine&s;s of his tem|per hindred him from complaining, and even &s;peaking of it; for he never found fault with any thing. The Marquis <HI>de Po|bar</HI> having ob&s;erv'd the incommodiou&s;ne&s;s which the King re|ceiv'd by this extream heat, adverti&s;ed the Duke <HI>d' Alva</HI>'s Gen|tleman of his Chamber of it, to the end he might remove the Fire away: He replied, It was not his Office, and that the Duke <HI>Due&s;da</HI> ought to be made acquainted with it, who&s;e pro|per Bu&s;ine&s;s it was. The Marquis <HI>de Pobar</HI> being troubled to &s;ee the King thus &s;uffer, and not daring him&s;elf to ea&s;e him, for fear of invading another's Province, left the fire &s;till in its place; but he &s;ent to give notice of it to the Duke <HI>Due&s;da,</HI> who was by Misfortune gone near <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee a &s;tately Hou&s;e he was there building. Word was brought of this again to the Mar|quis <HI>de Pobar,</HI> who propo&s;ed again to the Duke <HI>de Alva</HI> the taking away the fire. But he found him inflexible hereunto, and cho&s;e ra|ther to &s;end into the Country, to the Duke <HI>Due&s;da,</HI> &s;o that be|fore he was come, the King was almo&s;t &s;pent, and that very Night he fell into a violent Fever, accompanied with an Eri&s;i|pellis, which inflamed, and the Inflamation degenerated into the Purples, which cau&s;ed his Death.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="47">
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that having &s;een when I was abroad in the World, other Courts be&s;ides our own, I cou'd not for|bear blaming the&s;e kind of Ceremonies and Punctilio's which hinder the taking of one &s;tep fa&s;ter than another, th&ocirc; life de|pended thereon. The old Counte&s;s of <HI>Lemo</HI>'s lov'd to talk, and continuing her Di&s;cour&s;e, and among other names mention'd that of the Count <HI>de Villa Mediana,</HI> I have heard, &s;aid I, <HI>inter|rupting her,</HI> that this Gentleman, being one day in the Church of our Lady <HI>d' Arocha,</HI> and finding there a <HI>Religio</HI>'s, who begg'd for the Souls of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> he gave him a piece of four pounds. <HI>Ah my, Lord,</HI> &s;aid the good Father, <HI>you have now deliver'd a Soul.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> drew out again alike piece, and put it into the Ba&s;on. <HI>Here's,</HI> continued the <HI>Religio, another Soul deli|vered:</HI> He gave him in this manner &s;ix, one after another, and at the dropping of each piece, the <HI>Monk</HI> cry'd <HI>Here's a Soul deli|vered from</HI> Purgatory. <HI>Will you be po&s;itive in it,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Count. Yes, my Lord,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Monk, I am certain they are now in</HI> Heav'n. <HI>Give me now then back again my &s;ix pieces,</HI> &s;aid, he, <HI>for they &s;ignifie nothing to you, &s;eeing the Souls are already got to</HI> Heav'n, <HI>there's no danger of their returning again to</HI> Purgatory. It was as you relate, <HI>added the Counte&s;s,</HI> but he took not again his Money, for this wou'd have been among us an horrid <HI>Sacri|ledge.</HI> And I knew a man of good quality, who being much behind in the World, yet when he was dying, wou'd have fifteen thou&s;and Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for him. His la&s;t Will was executed, and his poor Creditors defrauded; for how ju&s;t &s;oe|ver their Debts be, they can expect to receive nothing, till &s;uch time as all the Ma&s;&s;es which are left in the Will be &s;aid. And this has given occa&s;ion to that common &s;aying among us, <HI>That &s;uch a one has made his Soul his Heir;</HI> whereby is meant, that he has left his E&s;tate to the <HI>Church</HI> to &s;ay Prayers for him.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth ordered in his Will an hundred thou|&s;and <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> to be &s;aid for him; farther declaring, That &s;hou'd he cea&s;e needing them, they &s;hou'd &s;erve for his Father and Mother; and in ca&s;e they were got to <HI>Heav'n,</HI> they &s;hou'd be ap|plied to the Souls of tho&s;e who were &s;lain in the Wars of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But what I have already told you of the Count <HI>de Villa Me|diana,</HI> brings to my mind, that he being one day at Church with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he &s;aw a great deal of Money on the Altar, which was giv'n for the Souls in <HI>Purgatory.</HI> He drew near, and took it up in his hand, &s;aying, <HI>My Love will la&s;t for ever, my Pains will be likewi&s;e</HI> Eternal, <HI>tho&s;e of the Souls in</HI> Purgatory <HI>will have an end; alas, mine will never end! This hope comforts
<PB N="90" REF="48"> them; as for me, I am without hope and comfort, &s;o that the&s;e Charities are more due to me, than they.</HI> However, he took nothing away, only &s;peaking the&s;e words as an occa&s;ion to bring in his Pa&s;&s;ion before this beautiful Queen, who was there pre&s;ent: For in effect, his was &s;o violent for her, that there is &s;ome rea&s;on to think &s;he was not wholly in&s;en&s;ible of it, if her rigid Virtue had not pre&s;erved her heart again&s;t the Count's Merit. He was young, well &s;haped, hand&s;ome, brave, magnificent, gallant and witty; every Body knows how he appeared to his Misfortune in a <HI>Caro&s;el</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with a Suit embroidered with pieces of new Money, called <HI>Realles,</HI> and which he bore for a Device;
<Q>MIS AMORES SON REALES.</Q> making an allu&s;ion to the word <HI>Reales,</HI> which is to &s;ay <HI>Royal,</HI> with the Pa&s;&s;ion he had for the Queen. This is finer in <HI>Spa|ni&s;h,</HI> and &s;ignifies in <HI>Engli&s;h, My Love is Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Count Duke <HI>d' Olivarez,</HI> the Kings Favorite, and the &s;ecret Enemy of the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Count,</HI> made his Ma&s;ter take notice of the boldne&s;s of a Subject, who dared even in his Pre&s;ence declare the Sentiments he had for the <HI>Queen;</HI> and in this moment he per&s;waded the King to be reveng'd on him. An occa&s;ion was waited for which &s;hou'd make no noi&s;e. But here's what ha&s;tned his ruine; applying his Mind only to di|vert the <HI>Queen,</HI> he wrote a <HI>Comedy</HI> which every Body likes, and the <HI>Queen,</HI> more than others, found therein &s;uch moving and delicate &s;troaks in it, that &s;he wou'd act apart in it her &s;elf on the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Birth-day.</HI> It was the Amorous Count who ma|naged and took care of the Fe&s;tival; he ordered the Cloaths, and provided Machines, which co&s;t him above Thirty thou|&s;and Crowns. He had cau&s;ed a great <HI>Cloud</HI> to be painted, un|der which the <HI>Queen</HI> was concealed in a Machine. He &s;tood very near it, and at a certain &s;ign he gave a Man who was faithful to him, he &s;et fire to the linnen work of the Cloud. The whole Hou&s;e, valued at an hundred thou&s;and Crowns, was in a manner con&s;umed; but he comforted him&s;elf, when ma|king his advantage of this favourable Opportunity, he took his Soveraign in his Arms, carry'd her into a little by-place, and there &s;tole from her &s;ome Favours; and that which is much taken notice of in this Country, is that he touched her foot. A little Page who &s;aw him, inform'd the Count Duke of it, he did not doubt but when he &s;aw the fire, but this was an
<PB N="91" REF="48"> effect of the Count's Pa&s;&s;ion. He made &s;uch an exact En|quiry, that he laid before the King certain Proofs of it; and his Proofs &s;o greatly enraged the King, that 'tis pretended he cau&s;ed him to be &s;hot with a Pi&s;tol one night, as he was in his Coach with Don <HI>Lewis de Haro.</HI></P>
<P>Here's a very Tragical end, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her;</HI> but whil&s;t, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I am &s;peaking to you of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, I cannot but I mu&s;t tell you, that he was vehemently in love with the Dutche&s;s <HI>Dalburkerke.</HI> He cou'd never meet with a favourable opportunity of Entertaining her. The Duke her Husband kept &s;trict guard over her, and the more Ob&s;tacles the King met with, the more his De&s;ires increa&s;ed; but when Night came, and when he was at play, he feign'd to call to mind he had a Letter to write of the greate&s;t con&s;equence. He call'd the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> who was in his Chamber, and de&s;ired him to take his place, and continue his Game. He immediately hereupon entred into his Clo&s;et, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, and went down by a back Stairs, and came to the young Dutche&s;s with the Count Duke his Favorite.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> who&s;e mind ran on his Dome&s;tick Intere&s;ts more then on his Game, ea&s;ily believ'd his Ma&s;ter wou'd not have committed it to him, without &s;ome &s;ecret De|&s;ign. He began then to complain of an horrid Collick, and uttering Cries and making Faces enough to fright one, he gave the Cards to another, and without any &s;top run home. The King had only ju&s;t arrived there without any Train, he was then in the Court, and &s;eeing the Duke come he hid him|&s;elf; but there is nothing &s;o clear &s;ighted as a jealous Husband. He perceiv'd the King, and being not willing to have Lights brought that he might not be oblig'd to acknowledge him, he made up to him with a great Cane which he commonly walked with: <HI>Ha! Ha! Villain,</HI> &s;aid, he to him, <HI>thou come&s;t to rob my Hou&s;e;</HI> and without more words he laid on him with all his &s;trength. The Count Duke was no more &s;pared, who fearing lea&s;t wor&s;e might happen, cried, out &s;everal times, <HI>'Twas the King,</HI> to &s;top the Duke's Fury: but this was &s;o far from ef|fecting it, that he redoubled his blows both on the Prince and his Mini&s;ter, crying in his turn, <HI>That this was a &s;troak of the greate&s;t In&s;olence, to make u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Name and his Fa|vorites in &s;uch an occa&s;ion, that he could find in his heart to &s;end 'em to the Palace, becau&s;e he well knew the King would cau&s;e 'em to be hang'd.</HI> In all this Fray the King &s;aid not a word, and at length got away half mad, in having received &s;o many blows, and not one favour from his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="49">
<P>This produced no ill Con&s;equences to the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke;</HI> but on the contrary the King being cured of his Love to the Dutche&s;s, made a Je&s;t of it &s;ome time after. I know not whe|ther I do not abu&s;e your patience by the length of this Con|ver&s;ation, <HI>added the Counte&s;s</HI> de Lemos, and I fall in&s;en&s;ible into the defect of per&s;ons of my Age, who forget them&s;elves when they tell of things done in their time. I &s;aw &s;he was for retiring, and having again thankt her for the honour &s;he had done me, I took my leave of her, and returned to my Inn.</P>
<P>The Weather was &s;o foul, that we with great difficulty &s;et out, but being re&s;olv'd on it, we marcht as long as the day la&s;ted, falling down and getting up as well as we cou'd. We cou'd hardly &s;ee four Paces before us, the Storm was &s;o great, that it blew off &s;everal Stones off the Rocks, which fell into our way, and hurt one of our Company; he had been kill'd, had he not &s;tept on one &s;ide. In fine, after having made about eight Leagues, according to our reckoning, we were much a|&s;toni&s;ht to find our &s;elves at the Gates of <HI>Lerma,</HI> without ha|ving advanced or gone back. We had &s;till turn'd about the Town, without perceiving it, as it were by Enchantment, &s;ometimes farther, &s;ometimes nearer, and we were all of us not a little out of humor at having taken &s;o much pains to &s;o little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;te&s;s tran&s;ported at the &s;ight of us, &s;he who cou'd have been glad with all her heart we &s;hou'd thus Travel as long as we lived, to return to lye at her Hou&s;e every night, tarried for me at the top of her little Stair-ca&s;e. She told me &s;he was very &s;orry &s;he cou'd not let me have my Room again, but wou'd give me another commodious enough, and that mine was ta|ken up by a <HI>Seignora,</HI> the greate&s;t in <HI>Spain.</HI> Don <HI>Fernand</HI> askt her name, &s;he told him, &s;he was called Donna <HI>Eleonor</HI> of <HI>Toledo;</HI> he as &s;oon inform'd me &s;he was his near Kin&s;woman. He cou'd not comprehend by what chance &s;he &s;hou'd come there.</P>
<P>To be &s;atisfied in the matter, he &s;ent his Gentleman to make her a Complement, and to know whether his vi&s;it wou'd not be trouble&s;ome. She &s;ent word &s;he had a great Satisfaction at this happy Meeting, and that he wou'd do her a great deal of honour. He went up immediately to her Chamber, and was inform'd by her of &s;everal particulars which related to him. He came afterwards to me, and told me very civilly, That where not Donna <HI>Eleonar</HI> exce&s;&s;ive weary and indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;he wou'd have given me the fir&s;t Vi&s;it. I in &s;hort, de&s;ired him to conduct me to her Chamber, where &s;he receiv'd me in a
<PB N="93" REF="49"> mo&s;t obliging manner; and I ob&s;erv'd in the fir&s;t moment of our Conver&s;ation, that &s;he had a great deal of Wit and Polite|ne&s;s. I found her very neat and hand&s;ome, her Eyes were lively and &s;o gli&s;tering, that one cou'd not without pain endure their brightne&s;s. Don <HI>Fernand</HI> told her who I was, and that I went to &s;ee one of my near Relations at <HI>Madrid.</HI> Her name was not unknow to her, no more than her Per&s;on, &s;he told me 'twas not long &s;ince the <HI>King</HI> had made her <HI>Titularia</HI> and <HI>Mar|chione&s;s</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tille.</HI> I &s;hou'd be greatly obliged to you, Madam, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her,</HI> if you wou'd be plea&s;ed to give me &s;ome Account of this title, &s;he having mention'd it in her Letters, without explaining to me what it means, no more than that of <HI>Grandee,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take a plea&s;ure to inform you of what I know, <HI>replied</HI> Donna <HI>Eleonora,</HI> and I have always heard, that in the time of the fir&s;t <HI>Kings, Doviedo, de Galicia</HI> and <HI>A&s;turia,</HI> they were elected by the <HI>Prelates</HI> of the Kingdom, and by the <HI>Ricos-homes.</HI> The&s;e Lords having not yet obtain'd the Titles of <HI>Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Counts,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;ht them from <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> they were call'd <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> which were as the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> now. The <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> &s;tood covered before the <HI>King,</HI> en|tred among the States, and had their <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> voice. And the <HI>Titulado</HI>'s at pre&s;ent, are the &s;ame which were then call'd <HI>Ricos-homes;</HI> but their Priviledges are not &s;o large, and mo&s;t of the&s;e Honours, as I &s;hall tell you, have been re&s;erv'd to the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Titulado's</HI> may have a Canopy or Cloth of State in their Chamber, a Coach in <HI>Madrid</HI> with four Hor&s;es, with <HI>los tiros largos,</HI> which are long Traces of Silk, which fa&s;ten the la&s;t Hor&s;es to the foremo&s;t. When there are <HI>Bull-Fea&s;ts,</HI> they have Balconies in the great place, where their Wives are regaled with Baskets full of Sweeetmeats, Gloves, Ribons, Fans, Silk-hofe, and this at the King or Towns charge, which gives the Fea&s;t. They have their Seat &s;et out in the Ceremonies, and when the <HI>King</HI> makes a <HI>Titu|lado,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;tile, Arragon,</HI> or <HI>Grenada,</HI> he enters into the States of this <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Grandees,</HI> there are three different Ranks of them; and the manner in which the King &s;peaks to 'em in making them, di&s;tingui&s;hes them. The one are tho&s;e whom he bids be <HI>covered,</HI> without adding any thing thereto; their Grandure is only fixt to their Per&s;on, and is not con&s;erv'd to their Fa|mily.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="50">
<P>The others, whom the <HI>King</HI> qualifies with the Title of one of their Lands; as for Example, <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Marquis</HI> of &s;uch a place, <HI>Cover your &s;elf, for you, and for yours,</HI> are <HI>Grandees</HI> in a more advantagious manner than the fir&s;t, becau&s;e their Gran|dure being fixt to their E&s;tates, pa&s;&s;es to their elde&s;t Son, and if they have none, to their Daughter or Heir.</P>
<P>The la&s;t are not covered till after they have &s;poken to the King; and the difference between the&s;e is ob&s;erv'd in &s;aying, <HI>They are Grandees for Life, or in their Race.</HI> It is farther to be ob&s;erv'd, That there are &s;ome whom the King makes be co|vered before they &s;peak to him, in &s;aying to 'em <HI>Cubridos;</HI> and they &s;pake, and hear the King &s;peak, ever covered. Others, who are only covered after they have &s;poke to him, and he has an&s;wer'd them. And the third, who are only cover|ed when they have withdrawn them&s;elves from the King to|wards the Wall; but when they be altogether in publick Offices, or at Chappel, there is no difference between them, they &s;it down and are covered before him. And when he writes to them, he treats them as if they were <HI>Prin|ces,</HI> they have the Title of <HI>Excellency</HI> giv'n them. When their Wives go to the Queen, &s;he receives them &s;tanding, and in|&s;tead of &s;itting on the Footcloth, they have Cu&s;hions brought 'em to &s;it on.</P>
<P>Here's Madam, <HI>continued Donna Eleonora,</HI> what you de&s;ired to know; after due thanks for her Civility, the hour of with|drawing being come, I took my leave of her, entreating her to continue me in her Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e before day, becau&s;e we had a great Journey to make to lye at <HI>Aranda de Duero.</HI> The Weather growing milder, it became very mi&s;ty, which at length turned to Rain; and in arriving at Night, our Ho&s;t told us we were very welcome to him, but we mu&s;t make a &s;hift without Bread. This is, <HI>re|plied I,</HI> a thing one cannot ea&s;ily be without. And in effect, this News put me a little out of humour. I enquired how hapned this Scarcity; 'twas an&s;wer'd me, The <HI>Alcaid Major</HI> of the Town (who is he that orders every thing) and who is both <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> had &s;ent for all the Bread and Meal which was at the Bakers, and had brought it into his Hou&s;e to make an equal Di&s;tribution of it, proportionable to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ities of each particular Per&s;on, and that what had occa&s;i|on'd this, was that the River of <HI>Duero,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es about the Town, was frozen, and the Rivers of <HI>Leon, Suegra, Burgos, Tormes</HI> and <HI>Salamanca,</HI> which throw and lo&s;e them&s;elves there|in, had likewi&s;e cea&s;ed their Cour&s;es, &s;o that no Mills cou'd
<PB N="95" REF="50"> grind, which made 'em apprehend a Famine: This oblig'd us to addre&s;s our &s;elves to him for to have the Bread we needed. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> &s;ent him one of his Gentlemen in the Name of us all, and immediately we had &s;o much Bread &s;ent us, that we gave part to our Ho&s;t and his Family, who much wanted it.</P>
<P>Scarce were we at Table, when one of my Servants brought into my Chamber &s;everal Packets of Letters, which they had found on the Stairs in the Inn. He that carried them having drank more than he needed, had fall'n there a&s;leep, by which means all his Letters lay expo&s;ed to the Curio&s;ity of all that pa&s;t by. Here is in this Country a very ill order touching Commerce, and when the <HI>French</HI> Currier arrives at St. <HI>Se|ba&s;tian,</HI> all the Letters he brings are deliver'd to others who are good Footmen, and ea&s;e one another. They put the&s;e Packets into a Sack, tied with rotten Cords to their &s;houlders, by which means it oft happens, that the &s;ecrets of your Heart and Family are open to the fir&s;t curious Body who makes drunk this Foot-po&s;t; and this is what hapned in this Occa&s;ion; for Don <HI>Frederic de Cardonne</HI> having lookt on the Super&s;criptions of &s;everal Letters, he at la&s;t met with one from a Lady in whom he was apparently intere&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t I &s;o judg'd from the emotion of his Countenance, and the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he opened the Packet. He read the Letter, and was willing to &s;hew it me without telling me from whom it came, nor for whom it was; but he promi&s;ed to inform me fur|ther about it at <HI>Madrid;</HI> finding it well writ, it came into my mind, that you wou'd be perhaps glad to &s;ee the &s;tyle of a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Lady,</HI> when &s;he writes to what &s;he loves. I prayed the <HI>Knight</HI> to let me take a Copy of it; but 'tis certain the Tran&s;lation takes away much of the beauty of the Original. Here it is.</P>
<P><HI>EVery thing contributes to afflict me in the unfortunate Emba&s;&s;y you have undertaken, not to mention that di&s;tance is the bane of the &s;tronge&s;t Friend&s;hip. I cannot flatter my &s;elf, that a Rup|ture between the Sovereigns, may abridge the time of your ab|&s;ence, and re&s;tore me a Good without which I can no longer live. Of all the Princes of</HI> Europe, <HI>he to whom you are &s;ent, is the mo&s;t at &V;nion with us. I can fore&s;ee no War with him, and this Scourge with which Heav'n puni&s;hes the guilty, wou'd be to me a thou&s;and times more welcome than Peace: Yes, I wou'd be glad to bear alone all the Di&s;a&s;ters of it, to &s;ee my Lands wa&s;ted, my Hou&s;es burnt, to lo&s;e my E&s;tate and my Liberty, provided we cou'd be to|gether, and that without your &s;hare in my Di&s;graces, I cou'd enjoy
<PB N="96" REF="51"> the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you; you may judge by the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions of the Condition I am in, when I think that you are really going away, that I remain at</HI> Madrid, <HI>that I dare not follow you, that my Duty &s;tiffes immediately the Projects I might make to comfort my &s;elf, and that I lo&s;e you, in fine, in a time wherein I have mo&s;t rea|&s;on to be per&s;waded of yours, and wherein I feel more the Marks you gave me of it; I &s;hou'd conceal from you my Grief, and add none to yours; but how can I weep and weep without you. Alas, Alas! I &s;hall be &s;oon forc'd to weep alone, are you not affraid &s;o lively an Affliction will kill me, and can you not feign your &s;elf &s;ick, that you may not leave me; think of all the Advantages which are included in this Propo&s;ition; but I am a Fool to make it you, you will prefer the King's Orders before mine, and 'twou'd bring me into new Vexations to put you on &s;uch a proof. Adieu, I ask you nothing, becau&s;e I have too much to ask you; I was never &s;o afflicted.</HI></P>
<P>As I ended the Tran&s;lating this Letter which I &s;end you, the <HI>Alcade</HI>'s Son came to &s;ee me; he was a young man who had a good Opinion of him&s;elf, and who was a true <HI>Guap.</HI> Let not this word offend you, <HI>(dear Co&s;in) Guap</HI> is the &s;ame in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> as a brave Gallant and Spark is with us; his Hair was parted on the Crown of his Head, and tied behind with a blew Ribond about four fingers breadth, and about two yards long, which hung down at its full length; his Breeches were of black Velvet, button'd down on each Knee with five or &s;ix Buttons; he had a Ve&s;t on &s;o &s;hort, that it &s;carce reacht below his Pockets, a Scollopt Doublet with hanging &s;leeves about four fingers breadth, made of white embroidered Sattin. His Cloak was of black Bays, and he being a Spark, had wrapt it round his Arm, becau&s;e this is more gallant, with a very light Buckler in his hand, and which has &s;tanding out in the mid&s;t a &s;teel Pike; they carried it with 'em when they walk in the Night on any Occa&s;ion, he held in the other hand a Sword longer than an Half-pike, and the Iron for its Guard was enough to make a Brea&s;t and Back-plate. The&s;e Swords being &s;o long that they cannot be drawn out, unle&s;s a Man has the Arms of a Giant; the Sheaf therefore flies open in laying the finger on a little Spring. He had likewi&s;e a Dagger, who&s;e Blade was very nar|row, it was fa&s;tned to his Belt on his back; he had &s;uch a &s;trait Collar, that he cou'd neither &s;toop nor turn about his Head. Nothing can he more ridiculous than what they wear about their Necks, for it is neither a Ruff nor a Band, nor a Cravat. His Hat was a prodigious &s;ize, with a great Band twi&s;ted about it, bigger than a mourning one. His Shoes were of as fine Leather as that whereof Gloves are made, and all &s;la&s;ht and
<PB N="97" REF="51"> cut, notwith&s;tanding the cold, and &s;o exactly clo&s;e to his Feet, that they &s;eem'd rather pa&s;ted on, and having no Heels. He made me in entring a Reverence after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, his two Leggs cro&s;s one another, and lowly &s;tooping as Women do when they Salute one another; he was &s;trongly perfumed, and they are all &s;o; his vi&s;it was not long; he was very brisk; he forgat not to tell me he went oft to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that there were no Cour&s;es of Bulls wherein he ventured not his life. But as the little care which was taken of Letters, run in my mind, and troubled me; I told him of the <HI>Courrier</HI> whom my People had found a&s;leep on the Stairs. He an&s;wer'd me, this hapned from the neglect of the great Po&s;t-ma&s;ter, or to &s;peak better, in that he wou'd gain too much, and that if the King knew of it, he wou'd not &s;uffer it. This Name of <HI>Great Po&s;t-ma&s;ter</HI> made me enquire of him, whether any one rode Po&s;t in <HI>Spain.</HI> He told me, yes; provided they had the King's leave, or of the Great-Ma&s;ter, who is always a Per&s;on of a di&s;tinct Birth; and that unle&s;s you have an Order well &s;igned, and in good form, you can have no Hor&s;es. But, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> A Man who has fought a Duel, or has other Rea&s;ons to ha&s;ten away; What does he? Nothing, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI> if he has good Hor&s;es he makes u&s;e of them; and if he has not, he is perplext enough; but when one will go Po&s;t, and parts not directly from <HI>Madrid,</HI> it is &s;ufficient to take a Billet from the <HI>Alcade,</HI> which is to &s;ay, Governour of the Towns where you pa&s;s. My Curio&s;ity being &s;atisfied on this Subject, the gallant <HI>Spaniard</HI> withdrew, and we &s;upt altogether, as we were wont.</P>
<P>I had been &s;ome time in Bed and a&s;leep, when I was awaken|ed by the ringing of Bells, and by a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of dread|ful Voices. I knew not as yet what was the Cau&s;e, when Don <HI>Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and Don <HI>Frederic de Cardonna,</HI> without knocking at my Door, bur&s;t it open, and calling out to me, as loud as they cou'd to make me hear (for they had no Light) came both of them to my Bed, and throwing my Gown upon me, they carried me away, with my Daughter, as quick as they cou'd to the top of the Hou&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repre|&s;ent to you my a&s;toni&s;hment and fear, I askt them at length, what was the matter? They told me the Thaw was come down all of a &s;udden, with &s;uch a great violence, that the Ri|vers, being &s;well'd by the Torrents which fell from all &s;ides of the Mountains, with which the Town is &s;urrounded, had fall'n on it, and overflow'd it, that at the in&s;tant when they came to take me, the Water had already got to my Chamber, and
<PB N="98" REF="52"> that all was in horrid Confu&s;ion, they needed &s;ay no more, for I heard dreadful Cries and Shrieks, and the Water &s;hook the whole Hou&s;e. I was never &s;o &s;eized with Fear in all my life; I affectionately regretted my dear Country! <HI>Alas!</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I have travell'd along way to come to drown my &s;elf on the fourth Story of an Inn in</HI> Aranda. All Raillery apart, I thought &s;eri|ou&s;ly my la&s;t hour was come, and I was &s;o troubled, that I was twenty times thinking to entreat the&s;e Gentlemen to hear me in Confe&s;&s;ion. I believe that in the &s;equel they wou'd have more laught at it than I. We were till Day in continual Alarms; but the <HI>Alcade,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the Town &s;o &s;peedily and effectually be&s;tir'd them&s;elves in turning a&s;ide the Torrents, and making the Waters pa&s;s, that we were only affrighted; two of our Mules were drowned; my Litters and Cloaths were &s;o &s;oakt in Water, that to dry them, we were forc'd to tarry one whole Day; and this was no ea&s;ie matter, for there are no Chimneys in the Inns, they heated the Oven, and put my Cloaths in it. I can a&s;&s;ure you, I have not gained any thing in this unhappy Inundation: I lay down after this or to &s;peak better, I bathed my &s;elf, my Bed being as wet as any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>My fellow Travellers thought fit to let me re&s;t a little; I have employ'd one part of my lei&s;ure time in writing to you. Adieu dear Co&s;in; it is time to fini&s;h: I am ever, more yours than any Bodies in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Exactne&s;s I ob&s;erve in giving you an Account of things which I judge worthy of your Curio&s;ity, puts me often times on Enquiries into &s;everal Particulars which I &s;hou'd have otherwi&s;e omitted, had you not per&s;waded me that you are a great Lover of Novelties, and that you love to Travel without going out of your Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Aranda</HI> in a time of Thaw, which as it ren|dred the Air warmer, &s;o it made the ways more trouble&s;ome. We came a while after to the Mountain <HI>de Samozierra,</HI> which parts the <HI>Old Ca&s;tile</HI> from the New; and we Traver&s;t it not without difficulty, as well for its height, as the quantity of Snow, with which the Bottoms were fill'd, and into which we &s;ometimes fell as from Precipices, believing the way even. They call this Pa&s;s the <HI>Puerto,</HI> which Name methinks &s;hou'd be only giv'n to a part, where one Embarks on the Sea, or a River; but it is thus, they call the Pa&s;&s;age from one Kingdom to another, and you make your way to your Co&s;t, for the <HI>King's Officers</HI> wait for Travellers in the Road, and let 'em not go till they have paid what they require.</P>
<P>In arriving at <HI>Buitrago,</HI> we were as wet as the night of the Inundation at <HI>Aranda,</HI> and tho' I kept my Litter, I felt no le&s;s the Incommodiou&s;ne&s;s of the Weather than if I had been on foot or Horsback, becau&s;e the Litters are &s;o ill clo&s;ed and made in this Country, that when the Mules pa&s;s through any Water, they throw up with their Feet part of the Water into the Litter, which there remains. So that I was forced in ar|riving, to change my Linnen and Cloaths: afterwards Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> the three Knights, my Daughter, and my Women, went with me to the Ca&s;tle I had been &s;o often told of.</P>
<P>It appeared to me as regularly built as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> not &s;o large, but every whit as plea&s;ant: The Apartments are better contriv'd, and the Furniture is richer and very &s;ingular as well for its Antiquity as Magnificence. This Ca&s;tle, as well as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> belongs to Don <HI>Rodrigo de Silva de Mendo&s;a,</HI> Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trana</HI> and <HI>de L'infantada.</HI> His Mother's Name is Donna <HI>Katherina de Mendo&s;a &amp; Sandoval,</HI> Heire&s;s of the Dutchy's of <HI>Infantada</HI> and <HI>Lerma.</HI> It de&s;cends from Father to Son of <HI>Ruy Gomes de Silva,</HI> who was made Duke of <HI>Pa&s;trana,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Eboly</HI> by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. This Prince&s;s <HI>d'Eboly,</HI> who has been &s;o much talkt of for her Beauty, was his Wife, and the King was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her:
<PB N="100" REF="53"> They &s;hew'd me her Picture; &s;he is repre&s;ented at her whole length, &s;itting under a Tent fa&s;tned to &s;ome Boughs of Trees; &s;he &s;eems as if &s;he were ri&s;ing, for &s;he has only a fine Linnen-cloth on her, which lets one part of her Body be &s;een. If &s;he were as hand&s;ome as her Picture makes her, and if her Features were &s;o regular, &s;he mu&s;t be judged the mo&s;t charming Wo|man in the World; her Eyes are &s;o lively and full of Spirit, that it &s;eems as if &s;he was about &s;peaking to you; her Neck, Arms, Feet and Leggs are naked; her Hair falls down on her Brea&s;ts, and little Cupids which appear every where about her, pre&s;s on one another to &s;erve her, &s;ome had her Slippers, others are ready to &s;trew flowers on her, and &s;ome hold her looking Gla&s;s. Others are &s;een farther off, who are &s;harpning their Arrows, whil&s;t others fill their Quivers with them, and bend their Bow: A Fawn looks on her through Boughs, &s;he &s;ees him and &s;hews him to a little Cupid, who is leaning on her Knees, and weeps as if he were afraid of it, at which &s;he &s;eems to &s;mile. I remained a great while looking on this Picture with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; but I was made to pa&s;s into a Gal|lery, where I &s;aw her again. She was painted in a large Piece attending Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second King of <HI>France</HI> whom <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed, in&s;tead of giving her to Don <HI>Carlos</HI> his Son, to whom &s;he had been promi&s;ed. The Queen made her Entrance on Hor&s;eback, as 'tis the Cu&s;tom, and I found the Prince&s;s <HI>Eboly</HI> le&s;s &s;hining near her than &s;he appeared to me when alone. You may hereby judge of the Charms of this young Queen; &s;he had a blue Sattin Gown, but as to the re&s;t, ju&s;t as I repre&s;ented to you the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Lemos.</HI> The King &s;tood in a Balcony to &s;ee her pa&s;s by. He had a black Suit with a Collar of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> his Hair reddi&s;h and gray, long vi&s;age, pale, old, wrinkled and ugly. The Infant Don <HI>Carlos</HI> accompanied the <HI>Queen,</HI> he was very white, a fine head, his Hair of a light yellow, his Eyes blue, and he lookt on the Queen with &s;o moving an Air, that it ap|pear'd the Painter knew the &s;ecret of his heart, and wou'd ex|pre&s;s it: His Habit was white, embroidered with precious Stones; he was in his Doublet, with his Hat botton'd upon one &s;ide, and covered with white Feathers. I &s;aw in the &s;ame Gallery another piece which much affected me, which was the Prince Don <HI>Carlos</HI> dying, he was &s;itting in a Chair, leaning on his Arm on a Table before him, holding a Pen in his Hand, as if he would have wrote &s;omething; there was a Ve&s;&s;el by him, wherein appeared a &s;ort of black Liquor, which appa|rently was de&s;ign'd for Poy&s;on. A little further you &s;ee the
<PB N="101" REF="53"> Bath preparing for him, where his Veins were to be opened; the Painter had perfectly well repre&s;ented the Confu&s;ion of &s;o &s;ad an Occa&s;ion, and having read his Hi&s;tory, and being much affected with it, methoughts I &s;aw him really dying. I was told the&s;e Pieces were of ine&s;timable value. I was afterwards conducted into a Chamber, who&s;e Furniture had belong'd to the Arch-Dutche&s;s <HI>Marguerita</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Governe&s;s of the Low Countries; and it is pretended &s;he had workt it her &s;elf, there is a neatly wrought Bed of Flowers, Woods, Animals, and Feathers of all Colours, the hangings are the &s;ame, and the different Colours therein do make a very agreeable &s;hew. And this is what I found mo&s;t remarkable in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bui|trago,</HI> and it growing late we left it.</P>
<P>It was &s;everal days &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the play|ing at <HI>Hombre,</HI> I therefore caus'd the Cards to be brought. Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> with two of the Knights, began the Game, and I intre&s;t my &s;elf, as I was wont, and Don <HI>E&s;treve de Carjaval</HI> did the like; &s;o that after we had &s;een them play &s;ome time, I demanded of him to whom of the three Knights was the <HI>Commander&s;hip,</HI> whence they came when I met them. He an|&s;werd me, It did not belong to any one of them; that he had been to &s;ee one of their common Friends, on a vexatious Ac|cident which had hapned to him in Hunting. Falling on the Subject of <HI>Commander&s;hips,</HI> I intreated him to inform me whe|ther the Orders of St. <HI>James, Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> were ancient. He an&s;wer'd me, 'Twas above 500 years they had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; that heretofore the Order of <HI>Calatrava</HI> was call'd the <HI>Gallant,</HI> that of St. <HI>James</HI> the <HI>Rich,</HI> and that of <HI>Alcantara</HI> the <HI>Noble.</HI> That which made 'em be call'd thus, was that or|dinarily there entred only young <HI>Cavaliers</HI> into <HI>Calatrava;</HI> that St. <HI>James</HI>'s was richer than the two others, and that to be receiv'd a Knight of <HI>Alcantara,</HI> one mu&s;t make his Proofs of four Races, whereas to enter into the others, there needed only two. In the fir&s;t times, when the&s;e Orders were e&s;ta|bli&s;ht, the Knights made Vows, lived mo&s;t regularly in Com|munity, and wore Arms only to Combat the <HI>Moors;</HI> but af|terwards the greate&s;t Lords of the Kingdom entred into it, who obtained the liberty to marry, under this Condition, that they &s;hou'd be obliged to demand an expre&s;s Di&s;pen&s;ation, from the Holy See, one mu&s;t have the King's Letter, make his proofs of Nobility, and likewi&s;e prove he comes of <HI>old Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> which is to &s;ay, there have entred no <HI>Jews</HI> nor <HI>Moors</HI> into his Fathers and Mothers Family. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Eighth gave in 1489. to King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors, the di&s;|po&s;al
<PB N="102" REF="54"> of all the Commander&s;hips of the&s;e three Orders, which are call'd <HI>Military.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> di&s;po&s;es of them in ef|fect under the Title of <HI>Perpetual Administrator;</HI> and he enjoys three great <HI>Ma&s;ter&s;hips,</HI> which bring him in above four thou|&s;and Crowns a year. When he holds a Chapter, as Great Ma&s;ter of the Order, or any other A&s;&s;embly, the Knights have the Priviledge to &s;it and be covered in his Pre&s;ence. Don <HI>E&s;teve</HI> added, That the Order of the <HI>Calatrava</HI> had 34 Com|mander&s;hips, and 8 Priories, valued at 120 thou&s;and Ducals a year; that <HI>Alcantara</HI> had 33 <HI>Commander&s;hips,</HI> 4 <HI>Alcaydies;</HI> and 4 <HI>Priories,</HI> which yielded 80 thou&s;and Ducals, and that the 87 <HI>Commander&s;hips</HI> of St. <HI>James,</HI> as well in <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> as in the Kingdom of <HI>Leon,</HI> were valued at 272000 Ducats. You may hereby judge, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI> that there are &s;ome helps for the poor Gentlemen of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>I agree, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> that this would be very advantageous for them, were they the only Per&s;ons admitted into the&s;e three Orders. But I think you now told me, that the greate&s;t Lords po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t <HI>Commander&s;hips.</HI> This is by a general Rule, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that <HI>tho&s;e who have much will have more,</HI> although there's the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice others &s;hou'd have a &s;hare; and the elde&s;t of great quality might have wherewith to &s;atisfie them in obtaining the Order of the <HI>Fleece,</HI> which extreamly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes tho&s;e whom the King honours with it. However, this being a Favour accompanied with no Revenue, and being not ea&s;ily obtained, few People &s;eek it, and you &s;ee ordinarily none but <HI>Princes</HI> have it. If you know who in&s;tituted this Order of the <HI>Fleece, &s;aid I to him,</HI> you will oblige me in informing me. It is pretended, <HI>replied he,</HI> that in the time when the <HI>Moors</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t the be&s;t and greate&s;t part of <HI>Spain,</HI> a pious <HI>Pea&s;ant,</HI> praying one day earne&s;tly to <HI>God</HI> to deliver the Kingdom from the&s;e <HI>Infidels,</HI> perceived an <HI>Angel</HI> coming down from Heav'n who gave him a <HI>Fleece of Gold,</HI> and commanded him to make u&s;e of it to gather Troops, becau&s;e at this &s;ight he wou'd not be refus'd to be follow'd for the fighting the Enemy. This holy man obey'd; and &s;everal Gentlemen took up Arms in effect on what he told them.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of this Enterprize an&s;wer'd the hope conceiv'd of it. So that <HI>Philip the Good,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in&s;tituted the Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> in the honour of <HI>God,</HI> of the <HI>Virgin</HI> and St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> in the year 1429. and the Day of his Marriage with <HI>I&s;abella</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> was cho&s;en for this Ceremony. It was made at <HI>Bruges,</HI> it or|dained
<PB N="103" REF="54"> that the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> &s;hou'd be perpetual Chief of the Order, becau&s;e St. <HI>Andrew</HI> is Patron of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Tho&s;e who have it are call'd <HI>Cavallero's del Tuzon,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Knights of the Fleece;</HI> and one may hence remark, that there is a dif|ference in relation to this Order, &s;aying, when one &s;peaks of the others, That &s;uch a one is Knight of the Order of St. <HI>James,</HI> or the Order of <HI>Calatrava.</HI></P>
<P>In the time when we were thus talking, we heard a noi&s;e, as of a Coach and Attendants that &s;topt, not long after, Don <HI>Frederic de Cardona</HI>'s <HI>Valet de Cambre</HI> entred into my Chamber, to tell his Ma&s;ter, that the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> was arriv'd.</P>
<P>This is an unhappy Encounter for me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for I parted expre&s;ly from <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee him; and having not found him at <HI>Burgos,</HI> I was not a little troubled at it.</P>
<P>Fortune is always on your &s;ide, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Sancho <HI>&s;miling to him,</HI> but not to retard the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing this Illu&s;trious Kin&s;man, we will leave off our Game. Don <HI>Fernand</HI> and Don <HI>Sancho</HI> aro&s;e. Undoubtedly, <HI>&s;ays Don</HI> E&s;teve, Don <HI>Frederic</HI> will not be of our Company this Night. I am of another mind, <HI>replied Don</HI> Fernand; the Archbi&s;hop is one of the mo&s;t obliging Per&s;ons in the World, a&s;&s;oon as ever he knows here's a <HI>French</HI> Lady, he will give her a Vi&s;it. He will do me a great deal of ho|nour, <HI>an&s;wer'd, I</HI> but yet I &s;hall be a little perplext, for we mu&s;t &s;up and go to re&s;t betimes. I had &s;carce ended the&s;e words, when Don <HI>Frederic</HI> return'd again.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever the Archbi&s;hop knew there was a &s;trange Lady at <HI>Buytrago, &s;aid he to me,</HI> he no more minded me; and if you plea&s;e, Madam, he will come and offer you whatever de|pends on him in this Country.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd this Civility as I ought; and Don <HI>Frederic</HI> being return'd to him, conducted him a while after into my Chamber. I found him extraordinary civil, he &s;pake little, and ob&s;erv'd the <HI>gravity</HI> befitting his Character, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation. He much bewailed my making &s;o long a Journey in &s;o rigorous a Sea&s;on, entreating me <HI>to lay my Commands on him in &s;omething wherein he might obey me.</HI> This is the u&s;ual Complement in this Country; he had a long Ca&s;&s;ock over his other Cloaths of pur|ple Velvet, with high ruffled Sleeves, which reacht to his very Ears, and a pair of Spectacles on his No&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for a little Monkey, which he wou'd needs give my Daughter; and though I was troubled at it, I cou'd not re&s;i&s;t his In&s;tances, and the De&s;ires my Daughter had of accepting it. Every time the Archbi&s;hop took Tobacco, which he often did, this little Ape reacht out his Paw to him, and he put
<PB N="104" REF="55"> &s;ome on it, which he made as if he wou'd take. This Prelate told me the King of <HI>Spain</HI> expected with extream impatience the An&s;wer of the Marquis <HI>de Los-Balbares,</HI> on the Orders he had giv'n him on the Demand of <HI>Madamoi&s;elle</HI> from the <HI>French</HI> King. If his mo&s;t Catholick Maje&s;ty's Greatne&s;s be con&s;ider'd, <HI>continued he,</HI> this Marriage mu&s;t needs be e&s;teem'd very ho|nourable; for when the Sun goes down in one part of his Do|minions, it ri&s;es again in another. And this Monarch enjoys not alone his Grandure, he has the plea&s;ure of &s;haring it to his Subjects, he is in a Condition to recompence them, to make them happy, to put them into high places, where their whole Ambition is &s;atisfied, wherein they receive the &s;ame Honour as <HI>Soveraigns;</HI> and is not this what a <HI>King</HI> ought to wi&s;h, to be in a Capacity to recompence magnificently the Services which are rendred him, and force even an unthankful Per&s;on to become grateful. It is a &s;urprizing thing, the number of Employs for Men of the Sword and the Gown, which his Maje&s;ty every day be&s;tows.</P>
<P>Several Per&s;ons have &s;poken to me of this, as you do, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> but I hope to be perfectly in&s;tructed in it at <HI>Madrid.</HI> I am able to inform you, at lea&s;t in part of what you wou'd know, <HI>replied he;</HI> &s;ome Rea&s;ons have oblig'd me to take a little Ab&s;tract, and which I think I have about me. He immediately delivered it to me; and having kept the Copy of it, and it appearing curious to me, I &s;hall therefore hear, dear Cou&s;in, tran&s;late it for you.</P>

<P>I ought not to omit ob&s;erving, That the Cathedral of <HI>Cor|dua</HI> is extraordinary &s;tately; 'twas built by <HI>Abderhaman,</HI> who ruled over all the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI> It &s;erv'd them for a <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> in the year 787.

<P>It is hard to believe, after what I have written of the Ca|thedral of <HI>Cordoua,</HI> that that of <HI>Leon</HI> is yet more con&s;iderable.

<P>Having read the <HI>Memorandum</HI> which the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bur|gos</HI> gave me, and made it to be copyed out, he withdrew, praying me that I would give him leave to &s;end his <HI>Olio</HI> to me, becau&s;e 'twas ready, and that I could not get any thing better for my Supper.

<P>Yet Don <HI>Frederick de Cardona</HI> was already gone to fetch it and he returned laden with a great Silver Pot; but he was much &s;urprized in finding it fa&s;tned with a <HI>Lock:</HI> This is u&s;ual in <HI>Spain;</HI> he would needs have the Key of the Cook (who taking

<HEAD>LETTER. VII.</HEAD>
<P>WE can ea&s;ily perceive that we are not far from <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Weather is fair notwith&s;tanding the Sea&s;on, and we have no more need of Fire; but it &s;eems very &s;trange to us, that in the Inns which are the neare&s;t to this great Town, you are wor&s;e u&s;ed than in tho&s;e which are an hundred Leagues di|&s;tant; you would think you came rather into <HI>De&s;arts,</HI> than near a Town where re&s;ides &s;o great a <HI>Monarch;</HI> and I can a&s;&s;ure you (dear Co&s;in) that in our whole Cour&s;e, I have not met with an Hou&s;e or Ca&s;tle that has plea&s;ed me; I am much amazed at it, for I thought that in this Country as in ours, I &s;hould find fine Walks, and curious Seats, whereas you can &s;carcely &s;ee any Trees, &s;ave &s;ome few which grow in &s;pight of the Soil: And at this time, when I am but Ten Leagues from <HI>Madrid,</HI> my Chamber &s;tands even with the Stable; it is an Hole that needs a Light at Noon, but what kind of Light think
<PB N="112" REF="59"> you? better have none at all; for this is a Lamp which bani&s;hes all Chearfulne&s;s by its glimmering light, and your Health by its &s;tinking &s;cent: and go you where you will, tho' to the Curate of the Pari&s;h for a Candle, you will not find one, and I doubt much whether there be any in his <HI>Church.</HI> Here every where a &s;ad Scene of <HI>Poverty</HI> pre&s;ents it &s;elf to your &s;ight; <HI>Don Ferdi|nand de Toledo,</HI> who took notice of my A&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould &s;ee very fine things at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but I could not forbear telling him, I could not ea&s;ily imagine it: It is true, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> bear up under their Indigency with &s;uch an Air of Gravity as would cheat one, the very Pea&s;ants telling their &s;teps as they walk; they are mightily inqui&s;itive after News, as if their whole Being depended thereon; I have had many of 'em come into my Chamber without any Ceremony, and without Cloaths on their backs, or Shoes on their Feet, entreat|ing me to tell them what I knew of the Court of <HI>France;</HI> af|ter I had &s;poke to them, they have examined what I have &s;aid, and argued on it among them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed great &s;en&s;e, and a lively apprehen&s;ion: This Nation has ever had &s;omething extraordinary among them above others.</P>
<P>There came to &s;ee me among others one of the Town&s;men's Wives, a good likely Woman; &s;he carry'd her Child in her Arms, which was a dreadful lean one; he had above an hun|dred little hands like tho&s;e of Joynted Babies hanging about his Neck, and on all &s;ides of him. I askt his Mother what this meant? She an&s;wered me, this was good again&s;t <HI>Evil Eyes.</HI> How, &s;aid I to her, do the&s;e little hands hinder one from any Di&s;temper of the Eyes? Undoubtedly, replied &s;he, but not as you mean; for you mu&s;t know if you plea&s;e, there are Peo-in this Country, who have &s;uch a <HI>Poy&s;on</HI> in their <HI>Eyes,</HI> that in looking &s;teadfa&s;tly on a Per&s;on, and e&s;pecially on a young Child, they make him pine away to death. I &s;aw a Man who had an <HI>Evil Eye,</HI> and doing mi&s;chief when he lookt with this Eye, he was obliged to cover it with a great Plai&s;ter: As to the <HI>other Eye,</HI> it had no <HI>Malignity,</HI> yet it &s;ometimes hapned that being with his Friends, when he &s;aw a great many <HI>Fowls</HI> together, he would &s;ay, choo&s;e which of the&s;e you would have me kill. He was &s;hewed one, he took off his Plai&s;ter, lookt fixedly on the <HI>Fowl,</HI> and a while after &s;he turn'd &s;everal times round as giddy, and fell down dead. This Woman likewi&s;e would per|&s;wade me there are <HI>Magicians,</HI> who looking on any one with an <HI>Evil</HI> intention, &s;trikes them with &s;uch a Langui&s;hment, as makes 'em become lean like <HI>Skeletons;</HI> and her Child, &s;he told me, has been &s;truck in this manner, and the common Remedy
<PB N="113" REF="59"> is the&s;e <HI>little hands.</HI> She moreover told me, it is the cu&s;tom, when they &s;ee any one look attentively upon them, and the Party has a look ill enough to fear &s;he &s;hould give the <HI>Evil d' Ojos</HI> (it is thus called, becau&s;e it is done by the Eyes) to pre|&s;ent her own of the&s;e Hands, or even her own &s;hut, and to &s;ay to her <HI>Toma la mano,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Take this hand;</HI> to which the Party &s;u&s;pected mu&s;t an&s;wer, <HI>Dios le benediga, God ble&s;s you,</HI> which if &s;he does not, &s;he is judged to be ill intention|ed, and thereupon he or &s;he may be denunciated to the Inqui&s;i|tion; or if you be the &s;tronger, you may beat them till they &s;ay <HI>Dios le benediga.</HI></P>
<P>I do not a&s;&s;ure you as a thing certain, that the Relation of the <HI>Fowls</HI> is po&s;itively true; but this is certain, that they are here &s;trongly per&s;waded there are Per&s;ons who can do you hurt by <HI>bare looking on you,</HI> and here are even <HI>Churches</HI> to which they go in <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> to be cured of it. I askt this young Woman if there appeared nothing extraordinary in tho&s;e they call <HI>mi&s;|chievous Eyes;</HI> She told me no; except that they are full of &s;uch a &s;hining Vivacity, that they &s;eem to be all on fire, and would make one think they will pierce you like a Dart. She moreover told me, that of late the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> had cau&s;ed an Old Woman to be &s;eiz'd on, who was accu&s;ed to be a <HI>Witch,</HI> and &s;he believed 'twas &s;he who had put her Child in that piteous condi|tion I &s;aw it. I askt her what they would do to this Woman; &s;he told me if there were Proofs &s;trong enough, &s;he would be infallibly burnt, or left in the <HI>Inqui&s;ition;</HI> and that the be&s;t treatment &s;he could choo&s;e would be to be delivered thence by being whipt along the Streets; That the&s;e Witches are tied to an A&s;&s;es Tail, or that they are placed on the&s;e Bea&s;ts coif'd with a Paper <HI>Mitre</HI> painted with all colours, with Writings which denote the Crimes they have committed: That in this fine Equipage they are led about the Town, where every one has the liberty to &s;trike them, or throw dirt at them. But, &s;aid I to her, how know you their condition would be wor&s;e if they remain'd &s;till in Pri&s;on? O <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me, I &s;ee you are not yet inform'd what the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is; whatever can be &s;aid of it, comes not near the Rigours exerci&s;ed therein: You are &s;eiz'd on, and thrown into a Dungeon; you lye there two or three Months, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, without a word being &s;aid to you; at the end of this time you are led before the Judges, who with a terrible look ask you why you are there? It is Natural to an&s;wer, you know not. They &s;ay no more to you, but &s;end you back again to this di&s;mal Hole, wherein is every day &s;uffered a thou&s;and times more
<PB N="114" REF="60"> trouble than Death it &s;elf; yet you are not &s;uffered to dye there, but remain many times a Year in this condition. At the end of this time, you are brought again before the &s;ame Judges, or before others, for they change, and go into &s;everal Countries; the&s;e demand of you again, why you are detained? You An|&s;wer, you have been Apprehended, but you know not for what. You are &s;ent again into your Dungeon without any more words. In &s;hort, &s;ometimes you pa&s;s over your whole Life there. And demanding of her, if it were the Cu&s;tom for one to accu&s;e him&s;elf, &s;he an&s;wered, that as to &s;ome Per&s;ons, 'twas the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t way; but that the Judges held only this cour&s;e with tho&s;e again&s;t whom they had no certain Proofs: for com|monly, when any one accu&s;es a Per&s;on of Capital Crimes, the Accu&s;er was wont to remain in Pri&s;on with the Criminal, and this is the rea&s;on of their being a little more moderate. She related to me the particular puni&s;hments, and the whole manner of them, with which I will not fill this Letter, nothing being more dreadful. She moreover told me, &s;he knew a <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> who was put into the Pri&s;on of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Seville,</HI> with his Father, who was a <HI>Rabbin</HI> of their Law. It is four years &s;ince they were there, when <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> having made an hole, climb'd up to the top of a Tower, and making u&s;e of Ropes he had provided, he &s;lid down along the Wall with a great deal of danger; but having got down, he re|proach'd him&s;elf for having abandoned his Father, and with|out con&s;idering the Risk he ran after more than one manner, &s;eeing his Father and he were condemned, and were to be led in a few days to <HI>Madrid</HI> with &s;everal others, to &s;uffer there the greate&s;t Torment; yet this hindred him not from deter|mining him&s;elf, he generou&s;ly climb'd up the Tower, de&s;cend|ed into the Dungeon, drew thence his Father, made him e&s;|cape before him, and got away him&s;elf. I found this Action very brave, and worthy to be &s;et as an Example to <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in an Age wherein, the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligations are &s;light|ed. I continued entertaining my &s;elf with this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wo|man, when <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> one of my Women, whom you know, came to tell me with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that &s;he now &s;aw <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Daucourt,</HI> and that if I would, &s;he would &s;tep out and call him: This is a Rich Gentleman, whom I knew at <HI>Paris,</HI> a civil Man, and of good Sen&s;e, and of comely Per&s;onage: I knew he had a Brother at <HI>Madrid,</HI> belonging to <HI>Don Juan of Au&s;tria.</HI> Having &s;hewed I &s;hould be glad to &s;peak with him, <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> went out in que&s;t of him, and brought him to me. After the fir&s;t Civilities, and informing my &s;elf of the News
<PB N="115" REF="60"> of my Kin&s;women whom I believed he knew, I askt him of his own Affairs, and whether he was content with his Journey. Ah, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;peak to me no more of my Journey, cry'd he, there was never a more unfortunate; and had you come &s;ome days &s;ooner, you might have &s;een me hang'd. How, &s;aid I to him, what do you mean by this? I mean, &s;aid he to me, that I had all the fear of it, and that this is the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant Country in the World for Strangers: But, Madam, if you are at lei&s;ure, and would know more, I will relate to you my Adven|ture. It is &s;ingular, and will fully prove to you what I have told you. You will do me a great deal of plea&s;ure, &s;aid I to him, we are here in a place where &s;uch a Relation will much divert us; he began it then in this manner.</P>
<P>Some Affairs wherein I was concerned, and the de&s;ire of &s;eeing a Brother whom I had been away from &s;ome years, obliged me, Madam, to undertake this Journey to <HI>Madrid:</HI> I was little acquainted with the Cu&s;toms of that place, I ima|gin'd one might go to Women without difficulty, and that one might play and eat with them; but I was a&s;toni&s;h'd to learn, that every one of them is more retired in her Hou&s;e, than a <HI>Carthu&s;ian</HI> in his Cell; and that there are Per&s;ons who have been mutually in Love for two or three years, and yet had ne|ver &s;poke to one another. Such &s;ingular Manners &s;eem'd ridicu|lous to me, I &s;aid thereupon freely whatever came into my Head; but I treated the matter more &s;eriou&s;ly, when I under&s;tood the&s;e Women who were &s;o clo&s;ely confin'd, were the mo&s;t amiable Women in the World; that they had &s;uch a Delicacy, Vivacity, and Manners, as are no where to be met with but among them; that Love always appeared new, that no one would change a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman but for another. I was in the greate&s;t de&s;pair at the difficulties there were to get at them. One of my Friends, named <HI>Belleville,</HI> who was my Compa|nion in my Journey, and who is a brisk Lad, was no le&s;s trou|bled on his &s;ide than I on mine: my Brother, who fear'd le&s;t &s;ome vexatious Accident &s;hould befal us, continually inculca|ted into us how Jealous Husbands are in this Country; great Murtherers, and no more valued the killing of a Man than a Fly. This did not agree very well with two Men who were not as yet weary of living.</P>
<P>We went into all parts where we thought we might &s;ee La|dies; we &s;aw &s;ome in effect, but this did not &s;atisfie us, all the bows and cringes we made 'em brought forth nothing; we each of us return'd home every Night very weary and di&s;gu&s;ted at our fruitle&s;s Circuits.</P>
<PB N="116" REF="61">
<P>One Night <HI>Belleville</HI> and I went upon De&s;ign to the <HI>Prado,</HI> which is a Walk adorn'd with great Trees, and &s;everal Foun|tains, they throw their Water a great heighth, and in great gu&s;hes it falls into Ba&s;ins, from whence it runs (when they have a mind) into the Courts to Water them, and &s;o to make them fre&s;h and plea&s;ant. It was the fine&s;t Weather this Evening that one could wi&s;h. After we had light out of our Coach, and &s;ent it away, we began to walk &s;oftly, and having made a few turns, we &s;at us down on the &s;ide of one of the Fountains, and then began to make our u&s;ual Complaints. Dear <HI>Belleville,</HI> &s;aid I to my Friend, &s;hall we never be &s;o happy to meet with one of the&s;e Witty and Charming <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women, &s;o much boa&s;ted of? Alas! &s;ays he, I de&s;ire it too much, but dare not hope it: Hitherto we have met with nothing but &s;uch ugly Creatures, as run after Folks to fright them, and who under their white Vails are more Tauny and Loath&s;om than the <HI>Bohemians;</HI> &s;uch as the&s;e, I &s;wear to you, do not plea&s;e me at all, and notwith&s;tanding their &s;prightfulne&s;s, I cannot con&s;ent to enter into a very near conver&s;ation with them.</P>
<P>At the very in&s;tant the&s;e words were out of his Mouth, we &s;py'd coming out of a Door hard by, two Women; they had left off their upper Garments, which were always very plain; and when they open'd their Manta's, the light of the Moon made the glory of their Gold and Precious Stones appear. As God's true, cries out <HI>Belleville,</HI> here's at lea&s;t two Fairies. Nay, &s;aid I, let's be ju&s;ter, and think them not other than two Angels. When they came near us, we &s;tood up, and made them the lowe&s;t Bow that ever we did in our lives. They pa&s;t by us &s;oftly, and with tho&s;e little Api&s;h Tricks, which become the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o well, they lookt at us, fir&s;t with one Eye, and then with t'other. They went on a little; we were in pain what to think, whether they would return back the &s;ame way, or whether we &s;hould follow them; but while we were deliberating, we perceiv'd them to approach us; when they were near us, they &s;tood &s;till, one of them began to &s;peak, and askt us, if we could &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> I &s;ee by your Habits, &s;aid &s;he, that you are &s;trangers. But pray tell me of what Country are you? We told her we were <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and that we &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> ill enough, but we had a great mind to learn to &s;peak it well: That to &s;ucceed therein, we were per&s;waded we mu&s;t love a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman, and we heartily wi&s;h'd we might find one that de&s;ir'd to be belov'd. The matter is nice, reply'd the other Lady, which had not yet &s;poke, and I &s;hould be &s;orry for her who engages in &s;uch a De&s;ign,
<PB N="117" REF="61"> for I have heard that <HI>Frenchmen</HI> are not Faithful. Oh! Ma|dam, &s;ays <HI>Belleville,</HI> this was &s;ome body which had a mind to do us an ill turn, and put us out of your good opinion, but it will be ea&s;ie to wipe off this A&s;per&s;ion. Though I may &s;oon give my Heart to a pretty Woman, yet I am very &s;en|&s;ible I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily call it back again. What! &s;ays &s;he that &s;poke to me before, dare you without further con&s;iderati|on, enter into &s;uch an Engagement at fir&s;t &s;ight? I &s;hould not have quite &s;o good an Opinion of you. Oh! Madam, cries he, why &s;hould we lo&s;e precious Time? If it is good to love at all, it is good to begin as &s;oon as 'tis po&s;&s;ible: Hearts that are born to Love, langui&s;h and decay when they are not exer|ci&s;ed therein. Your Maxims are fine, reply'd &s;he, but they &s;eem dangerous; it is not only nece&s;&s;ary to avoid following of them, but even the hearing of them; and then indeed they would have been gone, but we beg'd them with great earne&s;tne&s;s to tarry a few moments longer in the <HI>Prado.</HI> We &s;aid all the pretty things to them both, which might oblige them to di&s;|cover them&s;elves, and give us the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing them without their Vails. Our Conver&s;ation was very brisk, and plea&s;ant enough: they had abundance of Wit; and as they knew how to manage all their Advantages, &s;o without affecta|tion, they &s;hew'd us their Hands as they had occa&s;ion to mend the &s;itting of their Head-dre&s;&s;es, and they were whiter than the Snow. In &s;pight of their &s;eeming care to hide them&s;elves, yet we &s;aw enough to ob&s;erve their delicate Complexion, their brisk Eyes, and their Features very regular. You may be &s;ure we left them as late as we could, and that we conjur'd them to make that Walk happy &s;ometimes with their Pre&s;ence, or el&s;e give us leave to wait on them at their Hou&s;e. They agreed to nothing; and indeed, we were &s;everal times after that at the <HI>Prado,</HI> and near that Fountain where the fir&s;t &s;aw them, without being able to perceive them. Here's a deal of time lo&s;t, &s;aid we; what mu&s;t we do to pa&s;s our Lives in this great want of Employment, for we mu&s;t renounce the thoughts of Ladies, who&s;e Acce&s;s is &s;o difficult? This was our Re&s;olution, but it held not long, for &s;carcely had we made it, but we &s;ee come out of the &s;ame Hou&s;e the two <HI>Incognito's.</HI> We drew near them, full of Re&s;pect, and our civil Carriage did not di&s;|plea&s;e them. <HI>Belleville</HI> took the lea&s;t by the hand, and I the bigge&s;t. I endeavour'd to per&s;wade her with what Impati|ence I expected her. I blam'd her a little, at which &s;he &s;eem'd &s;omewhat concern'd; but taking more courage, I di&s;cours'd to her of the thoughts &s;he had in&s;pir'd me with, and a&s;&s;ur'd
<PB N="118" REF="62"> her, that it was in her power to engage me for my whole Life. She &s;eem'd extream careful not to give the lea&s;t mark of Fa|vour. At length, among&s;t other things, &s;he told me, that &s;he was Heire&s;s to a great E&s;tate; that her Name was <HI>Ines,</HI> that her Father was a Knight of the Order of St. <HI>James,</HI> and was of a con&s;iderable Quality; that &s;he, which was with her, was called <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and that they were Co&s;ins. All the&s;e par|ticulars pleas'd me well, finding her a Per&s;on of Birth and therein my Vanity flatter'd. At parting, I begg'd her to give me leave to come &s;ee her, What you de&s;ire of me, &s;ays &s;he, is the Cu&s;tom of your Country; and if I were there, I would plea&s;e my &s;elf to ob&s;erve it; but we have different, and tho' I do not conceive any Crime in what you ask me, yet I am oblig'd to ob&s;erve certain Rules of Decency, which by no means I will tran&s;gre&s;s. I will contrive &s;ome other way to &s;ee you, and of this, depend upon me, and do not take it ill, that I refu&s;e you a thing, which is not in my power to grant. Adieu, continues &s;he, I will think of what you de&s;ire, and will let you know what I can do. I ki&s;t her Hand, and &s;o with|drew, extreamly touch'd with her way, as well as her Wit and her Prudence.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was alone with <HI>Belleville,</HI> I askt him, if he was pleas'd with the Conver&s;ation he had enjoy'd. He an&s;wer'd me, that he had great cau&s;e to be &s;o, and that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;eem'd to be of a Nature &s;weet and amiable. You are very happy, &s;aid I, already to have found &s;o much kindne&s;s. <HI>Ines</HI> gives me no room to hope for any. She's of a gay Humour, and turns every thing I &s;ay to her into Je&s;t, and I de&s;pair ever to make her &s;erious. Some days pa&s;t, before we either &s;aw or heard from them: But one Morning as I was at Ma&s;s, an Old Wo|man, hid under a Vail, comes up to me, and pre&s;ents me a Billet, in which I read the&s;e words:
<Q>YO&V; appear too Amiable to me to &s;ee you often, and I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s to you, that I a little mi&s;tru&s;t my own Heart: If yours is truly touch'd for me, Marriage mu&s;t be thought on. I have told you that I am Rich, and I have told you the truth: That part which I offer you, is not inconvenient to take: But con&s;ider of it, and in the Evening I &s;hall be on the Banks of <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> where you may let me know your thoughts.</Q></P>
<P>As the place where I was did not allow me to write her an An&s;wer, &s;o I contented my &s;elf to Note only on my Table-Book the&s;e Lines:
<Q><PB N="119" REF="62">YO&V; have power to make me take what Journey you plea&s;e. I am very &s;en&s;ible, that I Love you too well to be at ea&s;e, and that I have more cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect my own Weakne&s;s, than you have to be afraid of yours; however, I &s;hall be at <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> being re&s;olv'd to obey you, whatever you Command me.</Q></P>
<P>I gave my Table-Book to this hone&s;t Me&s;&s;enger, which had the looks tho', to &s;teal off the Plates and Cla&s;ps before &s;he would deliver it. I de&s;ir'd <HI>Belleville</HI> to let me go alone to this A&s;&s;ignation. He told me, he was very glad of it, for <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had given him Notice, that &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him alone at the <HI>Florid.</HI> It was with impatience that we waited for the appointed hour, and then we quitted each other, after having wi&s;h'd our &s;elves good Succe&s;s in our Adventure.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came to the River-&s;ide, I carefully lookt at all the Coaches which pa&s;t by; but it was hard for me to di&s;cover any thing, becau&s;e they had double Curtains drawn. But at la&s;t, there came one and &s;topt, and I perceiv'd &s;ome Women in't, who gave me a &s;ign to approach. There was <HI>Ines,</HI> who was more conceal'd than u&s;ual, and I could not know her but by her Voice. How indu&s;triou&s;ly you hide your &s;elf, &s;aid I to her. Do you think, Madam, that the thoughts of not being able to &s;ee you, and the violent de&s;ires I have for it, are not enough to kill me with Grief? If you'l come along with me, &s;ays &s;he, you &s;hall &s;ee me. But for the pre&s;ent I mu&s;t hood|wink you. To be free with you, &s;aid I to her, till now, you have appear'd very amiable to me; but this My&s;terious Car|riage, which &s;erves to no end, but to make me &s;uffer, is trouble|&s;ome. If I am &s;o unhappy to be thought by you an unfaithful man, you ought not at all to tru&s;t me; but if on the contrary, I am in your good Opinion, you ought to declare it, by a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e ingenuous proceeding. Interrupting me, &s;ays &s;he, you ought to be per&s;waded, that I have &s;trong Rea&s;ons for what I do, &s;ince notwith&s;tanding what you have now told me, I al|ter not my Re&s;olution. The thing however is at your choice; but for my own part, I will not let you come into my Coach, but upon that Condition. As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally ob|&s;tinate, I rather cho&s;e to &s;uffer my Eyes to be cover'd than to break off with her. I mu&s;t needs own, that the&s;e appearances of Good Fortune, had fill'd me with &s;ome &s;ort of Vanity, and I fancy'd my &s;elf with &s;ome Prince&s;s, which for the pre&s;ent had no mind I &s;hould know her, but afterwards, that I &s;hould find her, one of the mo&s;t perfect and rich Women of <HI>Spain.</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="63"> This conceit hinder'd me any longer to oppo&s;e her will. I told her, I &s;ubmitted to her, to be hood-wink'd, and even to be blinded by her, if &s;he could plea&s;e her &s;elf in the Action. She ty'd a Handkerchief about my Head &s;o hard, that at fir&s;t &s;he put me in terrible pain: I &s;at me down by her; it was now dark, I knew not whether we were going, but I gave my &s;elf up entirely into her power.</P>
<P>She had with her two other Women; the Coach mov'd &s;o long, that I believe we pa&s;s'd through mo&s;t of the &s;treets of <HI>Madrid.</HI> She entertain'd me with &s;uch witty Di&s;cour&s;e, that I had no need to think the time or way long; and I was even charm'd with hearing her, when our unlucky Coach, which was but a mean one, run upon another and all on a &s;udden was over-turn'd. And we happen'd to fall in a place call'd the <HI>Mar&egrave;e,</HI> which is one of the greate&s;t and na&s;tie&s;t Ditches in the City. I was never &s;o vex'd in my life; the three Ladies fell upon me, they almo&s;t &s;tifled me, and I was even deaf with their noi&s;e. Having my Eyes bound, and my Head turn'd about after a &s;trange fa&s;hion, I could not have my &s;hare of making a noi&s;e, without &s;wallowing a great deal of this &s;tinking Water. I then began to make &s;ome Reflections on the unlucky hours of a Man's Life; and though I dearly lov'd <HI>Ines,</HI> yet I found that I lov'd my &s;elf more, and wi&s;h'd I had never &s;een her. I can|not po&s;itively tell how things pa&s;t, but I felt my &s;elf deliver'd from that heavy weight which &s;o oppre&s;s'd me; and when, by the help of &s;ome People which drew me out, I got upon my leggs, I could neither &s;ee <HI>Ines</HI> nor her Companions. The Folks which &s;tood about me, laugh'd like &s;o many Fools, to &s;ee me hood-wink'd, and &s;o cover'd with this black Water, that I look'd as if I had come out of an Ink-tub. I askt the Coach-man where his Mi&s;tre&s;s was. He told me the Lady with whom I was, was none of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;he went away cur&s;ing of me; that &s;he was very dirty; that he knew her not; and that &s;he only &s;aid to him at going away, that I mu&s;t pay him. And prethee, &s;aid I, where did&s;t thou take her up? He an&s;wer'd me, At the Gate <HI>Delcalcas Reales,</HI> and that an Old Woman came for him, and brought him to that place where he took her up. For my Money I got him to carry me home. I expected <HI>Belleville</HI> with a mixture of Impatience and Grief: It was late before he came, and he was extreamly &s;atisfied with <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in whom he found abundance of good Nature, and an infinite deal of Wit.</P>
<P>I related to him my Adventure, he could not but laugh heartily at it; and as he was fill'd with an extraordinary Joy, &s;o he told me a hundred plea&s;ant Stories, which put me in|deed
<PB N="121" REF="63"> into a very bad Humour: It was day-light before we went to Bed, and I had not got up, but to take a walk with him in the <HI>Prado;</HI> As we were going along by &s;ome very low Windows, I heard <HI>Ines</HI> cry out to me, <HI>Cavallero,</HI> go not &s;o fa&s;t, it is at lea&s;t fit to ask you how you do after your fall la&s;t Night. Advancing to the Window, pray, &s;aid I to her, what became of you, fair <HI>Ines?</HI> And had not I misfortunes enough, but I mu&s;t lo&s;e you too. You had not lo&s;t me, reply'd &s;he, but that a Lady, who was my Relation, pa&s;&s;ing by in that moment, knew my voice, and I was oblig'd again&s;t my mind, to go with her in her Coach, for I was unwilling &s;he &s;hould &s;ee us together; though the Coach-man told me another &s;tory, yet I dur&s;t not examine any further into the matter, for fear of making her unea&s;ie, and with abundance of kindne&s;s I askt her, when I &s;hould have an Opportunity without any re&s;traint to let her know what a mighty Pa&s;&s;ion and Re&s;pect I had for her. It &s;hall be very quickly, &s;ays &s;he, for I now begin to think you love me; but yet time mu&s;t confirm me in this Opi|nion. Oh! you are very cruel, &s;aid I, and mu&s;t have very little Love for me, thus to defer what I &s;o earne&s;tly beg. Speak the truth freely, &s;ays &s;he, and tell me whether you will Marry me? Yes, &s;aid I, if you will, I'll Marry you, notwith|&s;tanding I never yet had a full &s;ight of you, nor have had the happine&s;s to know you. I am Rich, &s;ays &s;he, and am of Birth, and they tell me, I have &s;ome Per&s;onal Merits. I reply'd, You have all the things which plea&s;e me, beyond any Per&s;on in the World: Your Wit hath charm'd me, but you make me often de&s;pair, and I had much rather choo&s;e to dye at once, than &s;uffer what I do. She fell a laughing, and after that, there were few Evenings that we did not conver&s;e together, either at the <HI>Prado,</HI> or at <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> or el&s;e at &s;ome Hou&s;e unknown to me, whither I was conducted. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never went into the Chamber with her, and I only talkt to her through the Grates of the Window, where for four hours together I u&s;ed to make the mo&s;t impertinent Figure in the World. To &s;peak freely, one mu&s;t live in <HI>Spain,</HI> to be able to endure &s;uch ways and Cu&s;toms; but yet really I lov'd <HI>Ines;</HI> I ob&s;erv'd in her &s;omething that was very &s;mart and taking, which &s;urpriz'd and affected me.</P>
<P>One time I met her in a Garden, where &s;he had appointed me to be, and where &s;he &s;hew'd me more kindne&s;s than &s;he us'd to do. When &s;he &s;aw it begin to be dark, &s;he de&s;ir'd me to be gone; I unwillingly obey'd her, and as I went along a narrow Street, I perceiv'd three Men with Sword in hand, &s;et
<PB N="122" REF="64"> upon one &s;ingle Man, who defended him&s;elf valiantly: I could not endure to &s;ee &s;o unequal a Match, and I run to Second him, but ju&s;t as I came up to him, they made a pa&s;s at him, and he fell upon me like a dead Man. The&s;e Murderers run away as fa&s;t as they could, and by this time the noi&s;e had drawn out a great many People, who &s;eeing me with my Sword in hand, made no que&s;tion that I was one of the Criminals. They prepar'd to &s;eize me, but perceiving their ill intentions, I thought it was better to provide for my &s;afety by flight, than to tru&s;t to my Innocence. I was clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, and which way &s;oever I took, &s;till they met with me. In this di&s;tre&s;s, I had a glymp&s;e of a Door half open, I &s;lipt into it without any body's &s;eeing me, and groping along, I came at la&s;t into a very dark Hall; I perceiv'd Light through a door, I could not tell whether it was be&s;t to open it, nor what I &s;hould &s;ay, if there were People in it. I con&s;ider'd with my &s;elf, that I had the looks of one affrighted, and that I &s;hould be taken for a Man that came from doing &s;ome ill Action, and &s;ought for an Opportunity to do &s;ome other: I delibera|ted a long time, I li&s;ten'd with great Attention to hear &s;ome body talk, and hearing none, at la&s;t I ventur'd, and &s;oftly open'd the Door, and &s;aw no body; I nimbly look'd about where to hide my &s;elf; methought the Hangings &s;tuck out in &s;ome places, and really I got behind them in a little corner: I had been there but a very little while, when I e&s;py'd coming in, <HI>Ines</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> I cannot expre&s;s to you, Madam, what a plea&s;ant Amazement I was in, to find my &s;elf in my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hou&s;e: I no ways doubted, that Fortune favour'd my De&s;ign; I was in no fear of tho&s;e who might &s;earch after me, and as I was even ready to go and throw my &s;elf down at her feet, I heard <HI>I&s;abella</HI> begin to Di&s;cour&s;e. Says &s;he, What ha&s;t thou been doing to day, dear <HI>Ines,</HI> Ha&s;t thou &s;een <HI>Daucourt?</HI> Yes, &s;ays <HI>Ines,</HI> I have &s;een him, and I have rea&s;on to believe he loves me de&s;perately, unle&s;s all my Rules deceive me; he talks very &s;eriou&s;ly of Marrying me; that which perplexes me, is, that he will fir&s;t &s;ee and know me. And how is it po&s;&s;ible for thee to deny either the one or the other? replies <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> No, I do not pretend to do it, an|&s;wers <HI>Ines,</HI> only I'll take the mo&s;t favourable Opportunities; I fancy I &s;hall not think it cunning to &s;et my &s;elf in a full light, and all the Curtains open; no, I intend they &s;hall be clo&s;e drawn, and that the Windows &s;hall only let in &s;ome glimmer|ing Rays of the Sun, which &s;hall &s;erve to &s;et me off. As to my Birth, I have got my Pedigree Authentically drawn, which
<PB N="123" REF="64"> co&s;t me nothing but a little Old Parchment gnaw'd by the Mice. And as to ready Money, thou knowe&s;t my Old Lover, hone&s;t <HI>Don Diego,</HI> will furni&s;h me: when <HI>Daucourt</HI> has told and receiv'd it, he will little think, that Thieves are appointed to take it away from him upon our very Wedding-Night: I have this day taken very fair Lodgings ready Furni&s;h'd; &s;o that thou wilt yield, I have neglected nothing which might contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o advantagious to me, and which I &s;o much de&s;ire. Says <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> Thy precautions &s;eem very wi&s;e; but yet I fear the di&s;covery of the Intrigue. But &s;ays <HI>Ines,</HI> Prethee my Dear, what do&s;t thou do? As to Marriage, I make but a &s;mall Progre&s;s, &s;ays <HI>I&s;abella;</HI> but to &s;peak truth, that is not my De&s;ign: I find <HI>Belleville</HI> an hone&s;t Man; I am &s;en&s;ible that I love him, I only de&s;ire the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his Heart, and I fancy, I &s;hould be &s;orry if he would Marry me. Thou art of an odd &s;ort of Humour, &s;ays <HI>Ines;</HI> thou love&s;t him, thy Fortune is none of the greate&s;t, thou might'&s;t be happy with him, and yet thou dur&s;t not de&s;ire to be his Wife. But prethee, &s;ays <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who told thee that I &s;hould be happy with him? Love is &s;o uncon&s;tant a thing, that hardly are the fir&s;t moments of Marriage plea&s;ant; I tell thee, Love mu&s;t have &s;omething continually to provoke and &s;pur it; Novelty is a grateful Di&s;h to it, and how is it po&s;&s;ible for a Wife always to be new? And how can a Mi&s;tre&s;s either, cries <HI>Ines,</HI> be &s;o? Go, <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> thy Modi&s;h Maxims are not rea&s;onable. Neither, &s;ays <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> can I like of what thou de&s;igne&s;t; and if thou would'&s;t take my Advice, thou &s;hould'&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider thine own Age; for to &s;peak freely, thou art Old, very Old: Is it ju&s;t for &s;ixty Years to put the Cheat upon a Man of thirty? He will be enrag'd at thee, he will certainly for&s;ake thee, or el&s;e he'll break thy Bones; nay, it may happen he'll knock thy Brains out before he leaves thee. <HI>Ines</HI> was of a quick Apprehen&s;ion and brisk; &s;he took it hainou&s;ly that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;hould reproach her with her Age, and immediately &s;he gave her the greate&s;t box on the Ear which perhaps was ever given. The other, of as ha&s;ty a Nature, return'd her two. <HI>Ines</HI> lent her a dozen good cuffs with her fi&s;t, which were &s;peedily repaid: So that my two Female Champions entred the Field of <HI>Mars.</HI> The Combat was &s;o extream plea&s;ant between them, that I almo&s;t broke my &s;ides with laughing in my little Hole, and I had much ado to hinder my &s;elf from breaking out aloud; for you may ea&s;ily believe, Madam, that I had very little concern for either of them, after the Trick which I under&s;tood was to be put upon
<PB N="124" REF="65"> me with &s;o much Malice, and when I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look up|on <HI>Ines</HI> as a common Jilt. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who knew all the weak places of her Enemy, took her Opportunities, and being both younger and &s;tronger, tore off her Head-dre&s;s, and left her all bald. In my whole Life I was never more &s;urpriz'd, than to &s;ee the Hair fall off, which before appear'd &s;o lovely to me, and which I thought had been her own: But this was nothing to what follow'd, for with one blow of her fi&s;t &s;he not only made &s;everal of her Teeth leap out of her Mouth, but al&s;o two little Cork-plumpers, which &s;erv'd to fill out her hollow Jaws. And here the Fray ended, for their Chamber-Maids, who had heard the noi&s;e of the Skirmi&s;h, run in, and with much ado parted them. They &s;aid the bittere&s;t things one again&s;t the other, and even threatned to reveal to the Inqui&s;ition mo&s;t terrible Crimes, with which they reproach'd each other.</P>
<P><HI>Ines</HI> finding her &s;elf with her Chamber-maid only, look'd at her &s;elf a long time in a great Gla&s;s, and prote&s;ted that there was nothing &s;o injurious, which &s;he had not &s;aid to <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> that &s;he might be reveng'd of her for the Abu&s;es &s;he had receiv'd from her: At la&s;t &s;he &s;at her down and re&s;ted her &s;elf a while; a little Table was brought and &s;et before her, and upon it &s;he lays an Artificial Eye, which u&s;ed to fill up the place of a Natural one &s;he wanted; afterwards, &s;he takes off her Face as much white and red Colour, as without any Hy|perbole, would have covered a Mask. It would be hard to de&s;cribe to you, Madam, the extraordinary ugline&s;s of this Woman, who till now, had appear'd to me very pretty. I rub'd my Eyes, I was like a Man that could not tell whether he doted, or had &s;ome idle Dream. To be &s;hort, &s;he undre&s;t her &s;elf, and was almo&s;t naked: and here I &s;hall forbear re|pre&s;enting to you this frightful Carca&s;s. But certainly, Love never met with a better Cure; in all tho&s;e parts where other Folks are fat and plump, &s;he was lean and hollow; &s;he lookt perfectly like a Skeleton, which by &s;ome &s;ecret Spring was made to move about the Room: She was in a Gown with a white Mantle upon her &s;houlders, her Head bald, and her Arms appear'd extream little and lean; &s;he bethought her &s;elf, that in the Scuffle her Pearl Bracelets broke, &s;he had a mind to gather them up, but had enough to do to find them; her Chamber-maid came to help her, they counted them, and found they had all but two, which were well curs'd for my &s;ake: <HI>Ines</HI> &s;wore by St. <HI>James,</HI> Patron of <HI>Spain,</HI> that &s;he would not go to Bed till &s;he had found them: Her Maid and &s;he lookt in every corner and hole, removing the Tables,

And as I had told <HI>Ines</HI> &s;omething of my Adventure, that I might give her &s;ome &s;atisfaction why I came into her Chamber, &s;o this lean Hag, would not keep my Secret, but to be reveng'd on me for having di&s;cover'd her crafty tricks, was re&s;olv'd to in|form again&s;t me. I have the Murderer in my power, cries &s;he; come, come along with me, and I'll deliver him up to you. Immediately &s;he opens her Chamber-door, and being follow'd by a Troop of <HI>Alquazils,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Serjeants or Bayliffs, deliver'd me up to them with all the nece&s;&s;ary Evi|dence for my &s;peedy Tryal. Says &s;he, I &s;aw this wretch with his naked Sword all bloody with the wound he came from giv|ing; he ran into my Chamber to &s;ave him&s;elf, and threatned me with Death if I would not conceal him. Whatever I could &s;ay in my Ju&s;tification was all in vain, they would not &s;o much as hear me; they bound my hands with Cords, and &s;o led me to Pri&s;on as a wretched Malefactor, whil&s;t good <HI>Ines,</HI> and the Mother and Si&s;ter of the wounded, loaded me with blows and cur&s;es; they cau&s;ed me to be put in a Hole, where I was &s;everal days without having the liberty to give notice to

<P>At la&s;t, <HI>Belleville,</HI> who &s;till continu'd to &s;ee <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> ac|quainted her with his grief, and beg'd her to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to di&s;cover at lea&s;t, what they had done with my Body: She was &s;o indu&s;trious to get Information about it, that <HI>Ines</HI>'s Chamber|maid, who had been ill enough us'd by her Mi&s;tre&s;s, told her the whole Secret of the Hi&s;tory, altho' her good Lady had &s;trictly forbid her. Upon this News, my Brother ran to beg the King to have pity on me, and to command them to re|move me out of that hole, which &s;eem'd more like Hell than a Pri&s;on: I &s;wooned away when I &s;aw light: I was &s;o wa&s;ted and weak, that I frighted folks; but yet I could not come out of Pri&s;on for &s;ome time, becau&s;e of certain Formalities; and I leave you to think, Madam, what I mediated again&s;t the perfidious <HI>Ines;</HI> but yet I know not whether ever I &s;hould be in a condition to put in execution all the Projects of my ju&s;t Revenge, for the Gentleman, who was wounded, conti|tued very ill, and his Life was de&s;pair'd of; mine depended upon &s;uch a tickli&s;h point, that I put up mo&s;t ardent Prayers for him; and in &s;uch a melancholy uncertainty, I pa&s;t a great many hours: But my Brother, who was per&s;waded of my In|nocence, omitted nothing for the di&s;covery of the Authors of this Murderous Act. At la&s;t, he under&s;tood, that this young and wounded <HI>Cavallero</HI> had a Rival, and he made &s;o diligent a Search and Examination, that he certainly knew that the Blow came from thence; he was &s;o fortunate to get him apprehend|ed, and this Man freely own'd the Fact, which acquitted me. I was therefore &s;et at Liberty, and I conceiv'd &s;o much Joy at it, that I was &s;ick for &s;everal days after; or rather perhaps, it was an effect of that unwhol&s;om Air which I receiv'd in the Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean while, wicked <HI>Ines,</HI> who to be &s;ure, was not much at ea&s;e, for fear of what might happen upon her &s;erving me &s;uch a plea&s;ant Trick, having notice that I was &s;et free, and in a condition to Reward her according to her Merits, pack'd up her Baggage, and one Night privately runs away, and no body knew whither &s;he was gone; &s;o that when we wanted her, at lea&s;t to make her an Example among&s;t the cheat|ing <HI>Jilts,</HI> we were di&s;appointed.

<HEAD>LETTER. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Would not, if you plea&s;e, Dear Co&s;in, have you angry, that I did not write to you as &s;oon as I arriv'd at <HI>Madrid:</HI> I thought it was better to tarry till I was in a condition to tell you &s;omething more exactly and curious. I knew that my Kin&s;woman was to go before me, as far as <HI>Alcouendas,</HI> which is about &s;ix Leagues di&s;tance from <HI>Madrid.</HI> As &s;he was not yet come, and I had a mind to &s;tay for her, <HI>Don Frederic de Car|donne</HI> propos'd to me to go Dine at a very fine Hou&s;e, the Ma&s;ter whereof was his particular Acquaintance: So that in|&s;tead of going into this little Village, we cro&s;s'd by it, and through a Walk plea&s;ant enough, we came to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don Augu&s;tin Pacheco.</HI> This Gentleman is ancient, and yet he is lately marry'd to <HI>Donna Thore&s;a de Figucroa:</HI> This is his Third Wife, and &s;he is but Seventeen Years of Age; but of &s;uch an agreeable Humour, and &s;o ingenious, that we were perfectly Charm'd with her Wit and her Per&s;on: It was then Ten a Clock when we got there. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally Lazy, and love to ri&s;e late; and the&s;e Two were yet in Bed. Her Husband gave us &s;uch a frank and civil Reception, as &s;uffici|ently te&s;tifi'd how much he was pleas'd that we came to &s;ee him. He went to walk in his Gardens, who&s;e Exactne&s;s yields in nothing to ours. I accompanied him without delay; for the Weather was very inviting, and the Trees in this Country are as forward in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> as they are in <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="67"> at the latter end of <HI>June.</HI> Indeed this is the mo&s;t Charming Sea&s;on for the Enjoyment of what they call <HI>La Prima Vera,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Beginning of the Spring: For when the Son begins to have more Force and Heat, it &s;corches and wi|thers the Leaves, as if they had pa&s;&s;ed through Flames. The&s;e Gardens of which I &s;peak, were adorn'd with Bowling-Greens, Fountains and Statues, and <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> was not backward to &s;hew us all the Rarities. He is much taken with them, and values not &s;pending Money thereon; for he is very rich. He led us into a Gallery, where there were divers Tables of Ce|dar Wood, &s;et full of Books. He immediately led us up to the Bigge&s;t of them, and told us, they contain'd an ine&s;tima|ble Trea&s;ure; and that there was a Collection of Plays of the be&s;t Authors: Heretofore, <HI>continued he,</HI> Vertuous per&s;ons could not think fit to go to Plays; there was nothing to be &s;een but Actions contrary to Mode&s;ty; they heard Di&s;cour&s;es which were offen&s;ive; the Actors made hone&s;t people a&s;ham'd; there Vice was flatter'd, and Vertue condemn'd; the Scenes became bloody with Combats; the weake&s;t was always oppre&s;t by the &s;tronge&s;t, and Cu&s;tom gave continuance to Crimes. But &s;ince <HI>Lopes de Vega</HI> hath &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully labour'd to reform the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Theatre, there is now nothing &s;uffer'd contrary to good Man|ners: Both the Favourite, the Footman and the Ploughman, with|out di&s;gui&s;e, keeping to their Native Simplicity, and making that plea&s;ant by an ingenious turn, find the Secrets to cure our Princes, and even our Kings, of that common Di&s;ea&s;e to hear Truth, when their own Faults are repre&s;ented. It was he who gave Rules for the&s;e A&s;cents, and who taught them to divide their Plays into Three <HI>Jornada</HI>'s, or Acts. Since his time, we have &s;een flouri&s;h the <HI>Mount alvanes,</HI> the <HI>Mendoza</HI>'s, the <HI>Rojas Alarcones,</HI> the <HI>Veles,</HI> the <HI>Mira de Me&s;cuas,</HI> the <HI>Coellos,</HI> and the <HI>Villaizanes.</HI> But above all, <HI>Don Pedro Calderone</HI> excell'd as to the Serious and Grave Part, and even in the Comick Part he &s;urpa&s;s'd all tho&s;e that went before him. I could not forbear telling him, That at <HI>Victoria</HI> I &s;aw a Play, which to me &s;eem'd bad enough: And if I might &s;peak my Judgment freely, I would not have them intermix with <HI>Holy Tragedies</HI> (which require great Re|&s;pect, and according to their Subjects &s;hould be worthily ma|nag'd) any idle or &s;illy Je&s;ts. He reply'd, That by this I had &s;aid to him, he knew the Genius of my Countrey; that he had &s;eldom ob&s;erv'd the <HI>French</HI> to like what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did; and as this Thought carry'd him to &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ing Reflections, I a&s;&s;ur'd him, That Naturally we have no Antipathy for any Nation; That we even thought our &s;elves oblig'd to do Ju&s;tice
<PB N="129" REF="67"> to our Enemies. And as to Plays, though I had yet found none to my Fancy, it did not follow but that there might be others much better and more agreeable to me. The manner of my talking to him did a little compo&s;e him; &s;o that he de|&s;ired me to go into his Wife's Apartment, which was at the end of the Gallery.</P>
<P><HI>Don Fernand de Tollede,</HI> and the Three other Knights, tar|ry'd there, becau&s;e it is not the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain</HI> for Men to go into Womens Chambers while they are in Bed: A Brother has not this Privilege, unle&s;s his Si&s;ter be &s;ick. <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> re|ceiv'd me in as kind and obliging a manner, as if we had been long acquainted. And this mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, in prai&s;e of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that nothing of that &s;ort of Familiarity which comes from want of, or a mean Education, appears in their En|tertainments; for with great Civility and Earne&s;tne&s;s they are very careful to pay what they owe to others, and at the &s;ame time do not forget what's due to them&s;elves. She was in Bed without any Coif or Cornet; her Hair was parted in the mid|dle of her Forehead, ty'd behind with a Ribbon, and wrapt up with Carnation-colour'd Taffety: Her Shift was very fine, and of &s;o va&s;t a largene&s;s, that it lookt like a Surplice; the Sleeves were as big as Mens, and button'd at the Hands with Diamonds: In&s;tead of narrow Point at the Neck and Hands, &s;he had hers wrought with Blue and Fle&s;h-colour'd Silk in Flowers; her Ruffles were of White Taffety Pinkt. &mdash;She had &s;everal lit|tle Pillows ty'd with Ribbons, and trimm'd with very broad and fine Lace; &s;he had Ba&s;&s;es all of Flowers of Point <HI>de Spain</HI> in Silk and Gold, which lookt very pretty: Her Bed was all of Copper, Gilt, with little Balls of Ivory and Ebony; her Bed-Head was adorn'd with four Rows of little Copper Balli&s;ters, very well wrought.</P>
<P>She ask'd me leave to ri&s;e, but when &s;he came to put on her Stockings and Shooes, &s;he caus'd the Key to be taken out of the Door, and that to be bolted. I enquir'd the Rea&s;on of this Barricading: She told me, That &s;he knew there was with me &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, and that &s;he had rather lo&s;e her Life than they &s;hould &s;ee her Feet. I broke out into Laughter, and begg'd her to let me &s;ee them; for that I could not apprehend that the thing was of that moment. It is true indeed, that for their Littlene&s;s, they are &s;omething extraordinary; for I have &s;een Children of &s;ix Years old have as great. As &s;oon as &s;he was up, &s;he took a little Cup full of <HI>Red,</HI> and with a good big Pencil &s;he laid it on, not only upon her Cheeks, her Chin, un|der No&s;e, above her Eye-brows, and the Edges of her Ears;
<PB N="130" REF="68"> but &s;he al&s;o be-daub'd the in&s;ide of her Hands, her Fingers, and her Shoulders. She told me, That every Night at going to Bed, and every Morning at ri&s;ing, they laid this Colour on; That &s;he did not paint, and that &s;he was willing enough to leave the u&s;e of this <HI>Red,</HI> but that it was &s;uch a General Cu|&s;tom, that it could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with; for let one be of never &s;o fre&s;h a Colour, they would look pale and &s;ickly when they were near others, if they did not u&s;e this <HI>Red.</HI> One of her Women perfum'd her from Head to Foot, with excellent Pa|&s;tils, the Smoak whereof &s;he made to a&s;cend to her; another took Orange-Flower-Water in her Mouth, and dexterou&s;ly through her Teeth &s;he &s;prinkled it like Rain upon her; and this they call <HI>Rou&s;&s;ia.</HI> She told me, That there was nothing that &s;poil'd the Teeth more than this was of &s;quirting it, but that the Water &s;melt better for it. Of this I doubted, and I thought it very ugly, that an Old Woman, &s;uch as that was which I &s;aw there, &s;hould come and &s;purt Water out of her Mouth, in my Face.</P>
<P><HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> having known by one of his Wife's Servants, that &s;he was dre&s;t, did not &s;tand upon the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey, but lead <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and the Knights, into her Chamber. The Conver&s;ation was not long in common, but we divided; for my part, I di&s;cour&s;ed with <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI> and &s;he told me, &s;he was born at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but was brought up at <HI>Lisbon</HI> with her Grand-mother, who was Si&s;ter to <HI>Don Augu&s;tin Pa|checo;</HI> &s;o that her Husband was her great Uncle; and the&s;e &s;ort of Alliances are often contracted in <HI>Spain.</HI> She talkt to me much of the Young <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and boa&s;ted mightily of her Wit, and told me, if I would go into her Clo&s;et, I might judge of her Beauty, for &s;he had her Picture there. I immedi|ately went, and was &s;urpriz'd with the Charms I ob&s;erv'd in this Prince&s;s. She had her Hair cut and curl'd like the Peri|wig of an Abbot, and an Invention for pre&s;erving Children from falling, &s;o big, that there were upon it Two Baskets of Flowers, and little Ve&s;&s;els of a Medicinal Earth, of which they eat a great deal in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> although 'tis an Earth that hath little Ta&s;te. <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> &s;hew'd me the Skin of a Serpent, which her Husband kill'd in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and though it was dead, yet I was afraid of it. Tho&s;e of this kind are ex|tream dangerous; but it &s;eems as if Providence had taken care to pre&s;erve Men from them, for the&s;e Serpents have a &s;ort of Bell about their Head, which rings when they move, and &s;o gives notice to Travellers to &s;ecure them&s;elves.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="68">
<P>This young Lady, who is a great Lover of <HI>Portugal,</HI> di&s;cour|&s;ed to me much in its Favour: She told me, That the Sea, which flows up into the <HI>Tagus,</HI> renders that River capable to bear the greate&s;t Gallions, and the faire&s;t Ships upon the Ocean: That the City of <HI>Lisbon</HI> &s;tands upon the &s;ide of a little Hill, which in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;cends to the very Brink of the <HI>Tagus:</HI> So that the Hou&s;es being built one above another, are all &s;een at once, and &s;o becomes a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. The old Walls, which the <HI>Moors</HI> built about it, are yet &s;tanding: There are of them four Rounds, built at divers times; the la&s;t may have a|bout &s;ix Leagues Circumference. The Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands up|on a Hill, hath its particular Beauties: In it you &s;ee <HI>Palaces, Churches, Fortifications, Gardens, Armories and Streets:</HI> There's always a good Garri&s;on with a Governor: This Fortre&s;s com|mands the City, and from thence they may thunder upon it, in ca&s;e it proves rebellious. The Palace where the <HI>King</HI> lives, is more con&s;iderable, if not for its Strength, yet for the Uni|formity of its Buildings: Every thing there is Great and Mag|nificent; the Pro&s;pect it has to the Sea hath made them take &s;o much care to beautify it. She di&s;cour&s;ed to me afterwards of the Publick Places, which are adorn'd with Vaults and Arches; and of the great Hou&s;es round about the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Convent, where the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is, before the Gate of which there is a Fountain, with a great many Statues of White Marble, which throw the Water every way. She added, That the Fair of <HI>Roucio</HI> is kept on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> of every Week, in a Place which might be taken for an <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis environ'd with little Hills, upon which are built &s;everal fair Palaces. There's another Place on the &s;ide of the <HI>Tagus,</HI> where the Market is kept; and there one may meet with every thing which can be de&s;ired, of the be&s;t in his kind, either in Fowl, Fi&s;h, Fruits, Herbs or Pul&s;e. The <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> &s;tands a little higher up, where there is infinite Riches and Rarities, and &s;ome Fortifica|tions are lately made to pre&s;erve them. The Metropolitan Church is not eminent for any thing but its Antiquity: It is dedicated to St. <HI>Vincent;</HI> it is pretended, that after he had &s;uf|fered Martyrdom, they refu&s;ed him Burial, and that the Ravens watcht over his Body, till &s;ome pious Per&s;ons came and took it up, and carried it to <HI>Valentia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to have it wor&s;hipt; and for this Rea&s;on there are Ravens kept in the Church; and there is a Box for them, into which are put the Alms to buy them Food.</P>
<P>Although <HI>Lisbon, continued &s;he,</HI> is a very plea&s;ant place to live in, yet we dwelt at <HI>Alcantara:</HI> This Village is not above a
<PB N="132" REF="69"> quarter of a League from the City; There's in it a <HI>Royal</HI> Hou&s;e, not &s;o fine for its Buildings, as for its Situation; the River &s;up|plies the place of a Canal: There one &s;ees admirable Gar|dens, all fill'd with Grotts and Cataracts, or great Falls of Wa|ter, as well as Spouts of Water. <HI>Belem</HI> is not far from hence: it is the place de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Sepulture</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> in the Church of the <HI>Hieronimites:</HI> It is all covered over with White Marble; the Pillars and Statues are of the &s;ame; the Tombs are in even Rows in three different Chappels, among&s;t which there are &s;ome well wrought. <HI>Belem, Feriera, Sacavin,</HI> and &s;ome other places about the City, are remarkable for the va&s;t quantities of Oranges and Lemons growing there; the Air you &s;mell there is all perfum'd; you can hardly &s;it down under the Trees, but you are covered with their Flowers; one &s;ees running among&s;t them a Thou&s;and little Rivulets, and it may be affirmed, that there is nothing more &s;weet in the Night, than the Murmurs and Harmony which are there frequently heard. At <HI>Belem</HI> there are great Magazines of Oranges, both &s;weet and &s;our Lemons, Pome-Citrons and Lemons. They load them on &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o tran&s;port them into mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e &s;he told me of the Knights <HI>del Habito de Chri&s;to, of the Habit of Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Multitude made them le&s;s con&s;idera|ble; and al&s;o of the <HI>Counts</HI> of the Kingdom, which have the &s;ame Priviledges as the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Las Comarcas,</HI> which are certain Lands belonging to the Crown, and divided into Counties of a con&s;iderable Value. She told me, That when the <HI>King</HI> intended to go abroad, the People had notice of it by a Trumpet, which &s;ounds very early in the Morning in the place through which his Maje&s;ty is to pa&s;s. For the <HI>Queen,</HI> 'tis a Flute and a Drum; and for the <HI>Infanta,</HI> a Hauthoy. When they all go abroad together, the Trumpet, the Drum, the Flute, and the Hautboy, march in a Company; and by this means, if any one which cannot get into the <HI>Pa|lace</HI> to pre&s;ent a Petition, he need only wait for the King's coming by. Eight Leagues from <HI>Coimbre,</HI> there's a Fountain in a place called <HI>Cedima,</HI> which draws in, and &s;wallows down every thing which touches its Water; Experiments are often made upon great branches of Trees, and &s;ometimes of Hor&s;es, which they cau&s;e to be brought there, from whence they cannot get back, but with great difficulty.</P>
<P>But that which cau&s;es the greate&s;t wonder, added &s;he, is the <HI>Lake</HI> of the Mountain of <HI>Strella,</HI> where there are often found the wracks of Ships, broken Ma&s;ts, Anchors, and Sails, and yet
<PB N="133" REF="69"> the Sea is above twelve Leagues off, and this is upon the top of a very high Hill too; it cannot be imagin'd by what means all the&s;e things &s;hould come there. Whil&s;t I was hearing with great delight <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> relate the&s;e things, her Husband and the re&s;t of the Company came and interrupted us. <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> was a Man of Under&s;tanding, and for all his Age, was very plea&s;ant. If my Curio&s;ity is not indi&s;creet, pray, Madam, &s;ays he, tell me, what Subject this <HI>Child</HI> has entertained you with? <HI>Mi Tio,</HI> replied &s;he, that is, my Uncle, you may ea&s;ily believe it was <HI>Portugal:</HI> Oh! I thought as much, cry'd he; There it is &s;he always choo&s;es her Field of Action. Dear <HI>God,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, every body has &s;ome place they love, and when once you are got to your <HI>Mexico,</HI> one cannot draw you from thence. You have been in the <HI>Indies,</HI> re&s;umed I, and <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> hath &s;hew'd me a Serpent, which &s;he &s;ays you kill'd there. It is true, Madam, continued he; and if it were not time for you to Dine, it would not, it may be, be unplea&s;ant to you to hear of what I have &s;een there. But, &s;ays he, I &s;hould go to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> and if you plea&s;e, I'll bring to you <HI>Donna There&s;a:</HI> It is there indeed, where I &s;hould lay the Scene of Di&s;cour&s;e, and where I could tell you of things which I believe you would not be unwilling to know. I a&s;&s;ur'd him, that he would do me a particular favour to give me &s;o &s;ignal a mark of his kindne&s;s; and that I &s;hould be over-joy'd to &s;ee the fair <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI> and to hear her talk of the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;he that di&s;cours'd &s;o admi|rably of every thing. He took me by the Hand and led me down into a Hall paved with Marble, which was hung with Pictures in&s;tead of Tapi&s;try, and &s;et round with Cu&s;hions. Cloth was laid there upon a Table for the Men, but upon a Carpet on the Floor, it was laid for <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI> my &s;elf, and my Daughter.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd at this Fa&s;hion, not having been us'd to Dine &s;o; however I took no notice of it, and I had a mind to try it, but I was never more unea&s;ie; my Leggs ak'd mo&s;t horribly: one while I lean'd upon my Elbow, and then upon my Hand: In a word, I could not Dine, and yet the good Lady was not &s;en&s;ible of it, for &s;he thought the Women in <HI>France</HI> were u&s;ed to eat upon the Floor, as they did in <HI>Spain.</HI> But <HI>Don Fernand De Toledo,</HI> who ob&s;erv'd me unea&s;ie, ro&s;e from Table with <HI>Don Frederick De Cordonna,</HI> and both of them told me, that ab&s;olute|ly I &s;hould &s;it with them; I was willing enough, provided <HI>Don|na There&s;a</HI> would do &s;o too; but &s;he dur&s;t not, becau&s;e there were Men, upon whom &s;he did not &s;o much as lift up her Eyes but by &s;tealth. <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> bid her come without Ceremony,
<PB N="134" REF="70"> and told her, that they mu&s;t let me know, that they were glad to &s;ee me at their Hou&s;e. But that which was very plea&s;ant, was, when this Lady was &s;et upon a Chair, &s;he was no le&s;s at ea&s;e, than I was when I &s;at upon the Carpet; &s;he prote&s;ted with a pretty &s;ort of freedom, that &s;he never before &s;at in a Chair, and that &s;he had never once thought on't. Thus we dined very merrily, and there was nothing which could be add|ed to the obliging manner of my Reception in this Hou&s;e. I gave to <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> &s;ome Ribbons, Pins, and a Fan. She was mightily plea&s;ed, and gave me as many thanks, as if the Pre&s;ent had been of value. Her thanks were not common, one could not ob&s;erve in them any thing that was low or covetous. And to &s;peak truth, they have abundance of Wit and Sen&s;e in this Country, it appears even in the &s;malle&s;t trifles.</P>
<P>I had not been gone an hour from this Hou&s;e, when I &s;aw coming towards us two Coaches drawn by &s;ix Mules a piece, which gallop'd a great pace, and fa&s;ter than the be&s;t Hor&s;es could do. I could hardly have believed that Mules could run &s;o fa&s;t. But that which I wondred mo&s;t at, was the manner of their be|ing harna&s;s'd. The&s;e two Coaches and their Furniture took up almo&s;t a quarter of a League of room. There was one with &s;ix Gla&s;&s;es indifferent large, and made like ours, except that the upper part is very low, and &s;o, inconvenient. Within, it had a Corni&s;h of Wood gilt, but &s;o large, that it lookt like one for a Chamber. The Coach was gilt on the out-&s;ide, which is only allow'd to Emba&s;&s;adors and Strangers. The Curtains were of Damask and Cloth &s;ew'd together. The Coach-man rode upon one of the fore-Mules; they do not &s;it in the Coach-box, although there is one; and upon my asking the Rea&s;on of it, <HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna</HI> told me, that he had been a&s;&s;ur'd, that this Cu&s;tom had been ever &s;ince the Coach-man of the Lord Duke <HI>D' Olivares</HI> drove his Ma&s;ter, who over-hearing &s;omething of great Importance which the Duke told to one of his Friends, reveal'd it; the matter having made a great noi&s;e at Court, (for it &s;eems the Duke accus'd his Friend of &s;ome in|di&s;cretion, which neverthele&s;s he was innocent of) ever &s;ince, they have been &s;o cautious to make the Coach-man ride upon the fir&s;t Mule. Their Traces are Silk or Hempen Cords, &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive long, that from one Mule to another, there's above three Ells di&s;tance; and I cannot under&s;tand, but every thing &s;hould break at the rate they run. It is true, that though they run very fa&s;t in the Country, yet they go very &s;oftly in the City; and 'tis a tire&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e thing to go &s;o &s;lowly as if they told their &s;teps. And though at <HI>Madrid,</HI> they have but four Mules,
<PB N="135" REF="70"> yet they have a Po&s;tillion. My Relation was in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Coaches, with three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies. The Gentlemen and the Pages were in the other, which was not made after the &s;ame manner. It had Boots, as formerly our Coaches had; they are to let down, and the Leather is open at bottom, &s;o that when the Women come out (if they have no mind their Feet &s;hould be &s;een) the Boot is let down to the ground to hide their Shoes. It had Gla&s;&s;es twice as big as my hand, made fa&s;t to each end of the Coach, for the conveniency of calling to the Footmen. Nothing more re&s;embles our Garret-windows than the&s;e do. The top of the Coach is covered with Gray <HI>Parragon,</HI> and the Curtains are of the &s;ame, large and long, hang with|out, and draw round, and are fa&s;tned with Buttons and Loops; This looks very ill, and you are inclo&s;ed within as if you were in a Box.</P>
<P>My Relation was dre&s;t, half <HI>French</HI> and half <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> &s;he &s;eem'd over-joy'd to &s;ee me, and I was no le&s;s to &s;ee her. As to her Per&s;on, I found her not at all chang'd; but I could not forbear laughing at her way of &s;peaking: She now under&s;tands very little <HI>French,</HI> although &s;he continually &s;peaks and loves it &s;o much, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for her to learn any other Lan|guage: But &s;he now mixes <HI>Italian, Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> with her own Natural Language; and this makes &s;uch a <HI>Jargon,</HI> as is very &s;trange to one, who knew her, as I did, to have the <HI>French</HI> Language in its purity, and able to read Lectures of it to the Learned. She cannot endure to be told, that &s;he has forgot it; and indeed &s;he does not believe it, having never left off &s;peaking it, either with &s;ome of her own Women, or with Amba&s;&s;adors and Strangers, who generally under&s;tood it. Ne|verthele&s;s, &s;he &s;peaks very ill: And if one is not at the Foun|tain-head, it is difficult long to &s;peak a Language well, which is every day changing, and continually making new progre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I found the Ladies which were with her extream pretty: I do a&s;&s;ure you, that there are in this Countrey &s;ome very hand|&s;ome and aimable. We embraced each other often, and went back to <HI>Madrid.</HI> Before we came there we pa&s;t over a Sandy Plain, of about Four Leagues, but &s;o uneven, that every mo|ment we fell into holes big enough to bury the Coach, and which hinder'd it for going very fa&s;t. This uneven way la&s;ted till we came to a little Village call'd <HI>Mandes,</HI> which is but half a League from <HI>Madrid.</HI> All the Countrey here is dry, and very open; you can &s;carcely &s;ee a Tree on any &s;ide you look: The City is &s;cituated in the middle of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is <HI>New-Ca&s;tile.</HI> It is above an Age &s;ince the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have cho&s;en to keep
<PB N="136" REF="71"> their Court in it, becau&s;e of the purity of the Air, and the goodne&s;s of the Water, which really is &s;o good and &s;o light, that the <HI>Cardinal Infanta</HI> would drink no other when he was in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and he caus'd it to be brought by Sea in Earthern Jars, well &s;topt. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend, that the Founder of <HI>Madrid</HI> was a Prince nam'd <HI>Ogno Bianor,</HI> Son of <HI>Tiberino,</HI> King of the <HI>Latines,</HI> and of <HI>Manto,</HI> who was a <HI>Queen,</HI> more Famous for the Science of <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> which &s;he under&s;tood to a won|derful degree, than for her Birth. 'Tis thought, that <HI>Madrid</HI> mu&s;t be in the Heart of <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e the little Village of <HI>Pinto,</HI> which is not above Three Leagues from it, is call'd in <HI>Latine, Punctum;</HI> and that is reckon'd to be in the Center of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I ob&s;erv'd was, that the City is not enclos'd either with a Wall or Ditch; the Gates, as one may &s;ay, are only made fa&s;t by a Latch; tho&s;e which I have already &s;een, are all broken; there is not &s;een any place of Defence, nei|ther Ca&s;tle, nor in a word, any thing which might not be for|ced with throwing of Oranges and Lemons; but yet it might be nece&s;&s;ary to Fortifie this City: The Mountains which are round it, are of &s;ome u&s;e for its Defence; I have pa&s;s'd through &s;ome places of them, which are &s;o narrow, that one might &s;hut them up with a good big Stone, and with a hundred Men op|po&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of a whole Army. The Streets are long and &s;traight, and of a good largene&s;s, but there's no place wor&s;e paved; let one go as &s;oftly as 'tis po&s;&s;ible, yet one is almo&s;t jumbl'd and &s;hak'd to pieces; there are more Ditches and dirty places than in any City in the World, the Hor&s;es go up to the Bellies, and the Coaches to the middle; &s;o that it da&s;hes all upon you, and you are &s;poyl'd unle&s;s you either pull up the Gla&s;&s;es, or draw the Curtains which I have &s;poke of; very of|ten the Water comes into the Coaches at the bottom of the Boots, which are open.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es there have rarely any great Gates to them, tho&s;e which have, are without Courts. The Doors indeed, are pret|ty large; and for the Hou&s;es, they are very graceful, &s;pacious, and convenient, though they are only built of Earth and Brick. I think they are altogether as dear as at <HI>Paris.</HI> The fir&s;t Story which they rai&s;e belongs to the <HI>King,</HI> and he can either let, or &s;ell it, unle&s;s the Owner of the Hou&s;e buy it off, which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly done, and this is a con&s;iderable Revenue to the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>There is commonly in every Hou&s;e Ten or Twelve Rooms on a Floor; in &s;ome Twenty and more; they have their <HI>Sum|mer</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="71"> and their <HI>Winter</HI> Apartments, and very often, one for Au|tumn, and another for Spring-time: So that having very great Families, they are forced to Lodge them in &s;ome Neighbouring Hou&s;es, which they hire on purpo&s;e for them.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not wonder, Dear Cou&s;in, that they have &s;o many Dome&s;ticks: There are two Rea&s;ons for it. The fir&s;t is, that both for Food and Wages the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give but two <HI>Rials</HI> a day, which is not above Six-pence of our Money. I &s;ay, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do this, for Strangers pay after the rate of four <HI>Rials,</HI> which is about Twelve pence of our Money. Neither do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give to their Gentlemen above Fifteen Crowns a Month, with which they mu&s;t wear Velvet in Winter, and Taf|fety in Summer: But then they live only upon Onions, Pea&s;e, and &s;uch mean &s;tuff, and this makes the Pages and Footmen as greedy as Doggs. But I &s;hould &s;peak of the other Dome&s;ticks as well as the Pages, for in this matter they are all alike, let them have what Wages they will. They are kept &s;o very hungry, that in carrying the Di&s;hes to the Table, they eat half the Victuals that is in them; they throw it into their Mouths &s;o burning hot, that you &s;hall ob&s;erve their Teeth all rotten with the Practice. I advis'd my Kin&s;woman to get a little Silver Stew-pan made and fa&s;tned with a Pad-lock, like that I &s;aw of the Arch Bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos,</HI> and &s;he did &s;o and now after the Cook hath fill'd it, he looks through a little Grate to &s;ee whe|ther the Soupe does well; and thus the Pages get nothing of it but the Steam. Before this Invention, it happen'd a hun|dred times, that when we thought to have taken up &s;ome Broth, we found neither that, nor any Fle&s;h; for you mu&s;t know, that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Temperate, 'tis when the Ex|pence is their own; they are not &s;o, when they eat at another's co&s;t. I have &s;een Per&s;ons of the Highe&s;t Quality eat with us like &s;o many Wolves, they were &s;o hungry: They were &s;en&s;i|ble enough of it them&s;elves, and pray'd us not to wonder at it, for they found the <HI>Ragoas</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, &s;o excellent, that they could not forbear.</P>
<P>There are Cooks-&s;hops almo&s;t at every corner of a Street: The&s;e have great Kettles &s;et upon Trevets. There folks may have &s;uch ordinary things as Beans, Garlick, Leeks, or a little Broth, in which they &s;teep their Bread. The Gentlemen and Waiting-women go thither as other People, for at home they only dre&s;s Victuals for the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, and their Chil|dren. They are &s;trangely Temperate in Wine; the Women never drink any, and the Men &s;o little, that a quarter of a Pint will &s;erve one a whole day. You cannot affront a Man wor&s;e,
<PB N="138" REF="72"> than to call him a <HI>Drunkard.</HI> Here's indeed, a great many things to make up the fir&s;t Rea&s;on why they keep &s;o many Ser|vants. Now follows the &s;econd.</P>
<P>When a great Man dies, if he had a hundred Servants, his Son keeps all he found in the Hou&s;e, without putting one away: When the Mother happens to dye, either her own Daughter, or her Daughter-in-law takes into her Service all the Women-Servants; and this Cu&s;tom holds to the fourth Gene|ration, for they are never turn'd away. They are put, as I have told you, into Neighbouring Hou&s;es, and have their <HI>Ra|tion,</HI> or Allowances. They come often to their Ma&s;ter or Mi|&s;tre&s;s's Hou&s;e, but 'tis rather to &s;hew they are not dead, than to do any Service. I was to &s;ee the Dutche&s;s of <HI>O&s;&s;ona,</HI> which is a very great Lady, and I was amazed to &s;ee &s;o many Chamber-maids and Women, for every Room was full of them. I askt her, how many &s;he had? She told me, &s;he had now only 300, but that very lately &s;he had 500 more. If particular Per&s;ons have this Cu&s;tom of keeping &s;o many Servants, the <HI>King</HI> mu&s;t needs keep abundance more, which without doubt is very chargeable to him, and mu&s;t hurt his Affairs. I have been told, that in <HI>Madrid</HI> only, if the Pen&s;ions which he gives are reckoned, he gives <HI>Ration</HI> or Allowances to above Ten Thou|&s;and Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the King's Hou&s;e, the Provi&s;ion for it is daily brought in, and it is regulated according to the Quality of the Per&s;ons. There is di&s;tributed both tame and wild Fowl, Fi&s;h, Chocolate, Fruit, Ice, Charcoal, Wax-Chandles, Oyl, Bread, and in a word, every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Emba&s;&s;adors</HI> have their certain Expences, and &s;o have &s;ome <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> There are Per&s;ons appointed to Sell at their Hou&s;es whatever I have ju&s;t now named, and that without pay|ing any Cu&s;tom or Exci&s;e: And this &s;aves them a great deal of Money, for the Duties upon all &s;orts of Goods and Wares are exce&s;&s;ive high.</P>
<P>None but Emba&s;&s;adors and Strangers are allow'd to have a great many Footmen and Pages to follow them: For by the <HI>Pragmatick</HI> (by which name they call all their Edicts of Re|formation, they are forbidden to have any more than two Footmen to follow them.) It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that they who keep four or five hundred Per&s;ons, may not be allow'd a|bove three to accompany them. This third, you mu&s;t know, is a Groom, which goes on foot, and keeps near the Hor&s;es, to hinder them from putting and intangling their Leggs in their long Traces, and he does not wear a Sword as the Footmen
<PB N="139" REF="72"> do: And I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that if Age is a recommendable Quality, the&s;e three Men have that in a good degree. I have &s;een Footmen of Fifty Years of Age, and never any under Thirty. They are very unplea&s;ant to look at, being very taw|ny, and of a Clowni&s;h A&s;pect: They cut their Hair clo&s;e on the top of their heads, only let a Round be a little long, but very grea&s;ie, and &s;eldom comb'd. The Hair they cut on the top of their heads, is done in the &s;hape of a Wild Boar's Head. They wear long Swords, with Shoulder-Belts and Cloaks. They are all cloath'd either in Blew or Green; and often their green Cloth Cloaks are lined with blew Velvet cut in Flowers; their Sleeves are either of Velvet, Sattin, or Damask. One would think that the&s;e &s;hould be hand&s;ome Liveries, but yet I a&s;&s;ure you, nothing is uglier; and their ill Looks di&s;parage their Clothes. They wear Bands, but without any Collar, which is ridiculous. And upon their Cloathes they have neither Gal|loons, nor tufted Buttons and Loops, nor any &s;ort of Lace or Trimming.</P>
<P>Their Gentlemen and their Pages always go in a Coach that follows; the&s;e wear black Cloathes in all Sea&s;ons: In Winter they wear Velvet, with Cloth Cloaks very long, but when they Mourn, they draw upon the ground. Although they are Pages, they wear no Swords, only mo&s;t of them have a little Poniard hid under their Cloaths. In Summer they wear either Damask or Taffety, with Cloaks of a black Stuff very light.</P>
<P>It is only the great <HI>Lords,</HI> and the <HI>Titulado's,</HI> or Men of <HI>Title,</HI> which are permitted to have four Mules to their Coaches with tho&s;e long Traces in the City. If any Per&s;on, without the di&s;tinction of &s;ome Character, let him be as Rich as he will, &s;hould appear in the &s;ame Equipage, he would be affronted and abus'd in the open Street, his Traces would be cut, and him&s;elf Fin'd very high. Here, it is not enough to be Rich, a Man mu&s;t al&s;o be of &s;ome Quality. The <HI>King</HI> only, can have &s;ix Mules to his own Coach, and to tho&s;e of his Attendants; which Coaches are not like others, and are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by this, that they are covered with green Oyl-Cloth round, as well as on the top, ju&s;t as the Stage-Coaches in <HI>France,</HI> except that they are not of Wickers but the carved Work is very coar&s;e, and ill done, and they have falling Boots, and all is very ugly; and one would wonder how &s;o great a <HI>King</HI> can make u&s;e of them. But I have been told, that the&s;e fa&s;hion'd Coaches were in u&s;e in <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's time, that his were ju&s;t like them; and that it is in imitation of &s;o great an <HI>Emperour,</HI> that all the <HI>Kings</HI> which have Reigned &s;ince, will have no other. Without
<PB N="140" REF="73"> doubt there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;uch great Rea&s;on; for notwith|&s;tanding this, the <HI>King</HI> has as fine Coaches as any are in the World, &s;ome made in <HI>France,</HI> and others in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other Parts. The great Per&s;ons have al&s;o very &s;tately ones; but af|ter the <HI>King</HI>'s Example, they do not u&s;e them four times a Year. All Coaches are kept in large Courts, in which there are &s;everal Partitions enclo&s;ed. There are it may be to the number of two hundred in one Yard, and there are &s;everal of the&s;e Yards or Courts in divers parts of the City. The Rea&s;on why they &s;et them abroad is, becau&s;e they have no room for them at home, their Hou&s;es being built, as I have already &s;aid, without Courts or great Gates. Of late, they begin to alter their Fa&s;hion, and u&s;e Hor&s;es in&s;tead of Mules. And to be ju&s;t, the&s;e Hor&s;es are extream beautiful; there is nothing wanting to them, and it would be difficult for the be&s;t Painters to draw any in greater Perfection. But 'tis a piece of Cruelty to make them draw &s;uch huge Coaches, which are almo&s;t as heavy as a Hou&s;e; be&s;ides the Streets are &s;o very ill pav'd, that their Feet are quite &s;poyl'd in two Years time. They co&s;t very dear, and are not big enough for their Coaches. But I have &s;een &s;ome draw their pretty little <HI>Cala&s;hes,</HI> which were all painted and gilt, like tho&s;e which are made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and nothing look'd more plea&s;ant; and by their &s;wift running, and hand&s;om car|rying of their Heads, you would take them for Stags. As &s;oon as you are out of Town you may put &s;ix Hor&s;es to your Coach. Their Harne&s;s are very neat, and they trim their Manes, which hang to the ground, with Ribbons of divers colours; and &s;ome|times they dre&s;s up their Manes with a great many puffs of Sil|ver, Gauze, which makes a very pretty &s;hew. The Harne&s;s for their Mules, are made of Leather, flat and broad, with which they cover them almo&s;t all over.</P>
<P>Two days ago I went with my Kin&s;woman to walk without St. <HI>Bernardine</HI>'s Gate. 'Tis a place they frequent in Winter. <HI>Don Antonio</HI> of <HI>Toledo,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> was there, with the Duke of <HI>&V;zeda,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Altamire.</HI> He had a Harne&s;s for his Hor&s;es of an <HI>I&s;abella</HI> colour, which &s;o plea&s;ed me, that I could not forbear &s;peaking to him of it when his Coach came near ours. According to Cu&s;tom, he told me, that he laid them all at my Feet; and at Night when we got home, I was told, that his Gentleman de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me. He made me a Complement, and told me, that his Ma&s;ter's &s;ix Hor&s;es were in my Stable. My Kin&s;woman fell a laughing, and made An&s;wer for me, that I was &s;o lately arriv'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that I did not yet under&s;tand, that one mu&s;t not prai&s;e any
<PB N="141" REF="73"> thing which belong'd to &s;o generous a <HI>Cavaliero,</HI> as <HI>Don Anto|nia;</HI> but however, 'twas not the Fa&s;hion to receive Pre&s;ents of &s;o great value, and de&s;ired him to take them back again. But this he would not do, we &s;ent them back immediately; he re|turn'd them, and &s;o did we. To be &s;hort, the whole Evening pa&s;t thus in &s;ending backwards and forwards; and at la&s;t, we were forced to write him a Letter, and give our &s;elves a great deal of trouble to per&s;wade him not to take it ill, that I would not accept them.</P>
<P>I am told, that after the <HI>King</HI> has once made u&s;e of a <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> in Re&s;pect to him, no body afterwards will ride on him. It happened, that the Duke of <HI>Medina De las Torres</HI> had bought a Hor&s;e worth Five and Twenty Thou&s;and Crowns, he was the hand&s;ome&s;t and the brave&s;t which was ever &s;een. He caus'd his Picture to be taken; <HI>King Philip</HI> the Fourth &s;aw it, and had a mind to &s;ee the Hor&s;e. The <HI>Duke</HI> begg'd him to accept of him; but he refus'd him, and gave this Rea&s;on, That as he &s;hould &s;eldom ride on him, and that no body would make u&s;e of him after he had mounted him, &s;o the &s;trength and u&s;eful|ne&s;s of the Hor&s;e would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual here for good Families to put their younger Daughters to <HI>Ladies;</HI> by whom they are employ'd for the mo&s;t part to Embroider in Gold and Silver, or in Silk of various co|lours, about their Shift-Necks or Hands: But if they are left to follow their own Natural Inclination, they work very little, and talk much. They keep al&s;o both Male and Female-Dwarfs, and very ugly ones: The Females particularly have very fright|ful looks, their Heads are bigger than their Bodies; they always wear their Hair loo&s;e about their Ears, and hanging down to the ground: At fir&s;t &s;ight, one would wonder what the&s;e little Figures were when they pre&s;ent them&s;elves before ones Eyes. They wear Rich Cloaths; they are their Mi&s;tre&s;s's Confidents, and for this Rea&s;on, they are deny'd nothing they have a mind to.</P>
<P>In every Hou&s;e at a certain &s;tated hour, all the Women meet with the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family, in the Chappel, there to re|peat their <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> aloud; they make u&s;e of no Book to &s;ay their Prayers by; indeed it is very &s;eldom they have any. The Count of <HI>Charny,</HI> who is a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> very hand&s;om, and of great worth, and is the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s General of his Hor&s;e in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> told me, that the other day being at <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and as he was &s;aying his Prayers by his Book, an Old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman came and &s;natch'd it from him, and with great Indignation threw it to the ground, &s;aying to him, <HI>Let this alone, and make
<PB N="142" REF="74"> u&s;e of your Beads.</HI> It is a &s;trange thing to con&s;ider how conti|nually fond they are of their <HI>Beads;</HI> every Woman there has a pair fa&s;tned to her Girdle, and &s;o long, that they almo&s;t touch the ground. They are perpetually without cea&s;ing u&s;ing them, in the Streets, as they play at <HI>Omber,</HI> as they Di&s;cour&s;e, nay, when they are making Love, when they are telling Lies, or &s;peaking Evil of their Neighbours. They are continually mut|tering over their <HI>Beads,</HI> let them be in never &s;o much Compa|ny, nothing of this hinders them &s;till to keep on their pace. I leave you to judge what Devotion there can be in this; but Cu&s;tom has a great Power in this Country.</P>
<P>Till of late, Women wore Vertingales of a prodigious big|ne&s;s; this Fa&s;hion was very trouble&s;om to them&s;elves as well as others. There were hardly any doors wide enough for them to go through: But they have left them off now, and only wear them when they go to appear in the Queen's or the King's Pre&s;ence: Commonly in the City they wear a certain &s;ort of Ve&s;tment, which to &s;peak properly, is <HI>a young or little Vertin|gale.</HI> They are made of thick Copper Wyre in a round form, about the Girdle, there are Ribbons fa&s;tned to them, with which they tye another round of the &s;ame form, which falls down a little lower, and which is wider; and of the&s;e they have five or &s;ix rounds which reach down to the ground, and bear out their Petticoats and other Garments. They wear a va&s;t number of this Device; and one would hardly believe that &s;o little Creatures as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women are, could bear &s;uch a load. Their upper Garment is always of coar&s;e black Taffety, or of a grey plain Stuff made of Goats-hair, with a Tru&s;s or Fardle coming down a little above the Knees, and round the upper Garments; and if you ask them to what end this &s;erves? they'll an&s;wer you, that with this they can make it longer as it wears out. The <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> as well as others, u&s;es this to all her Garments. Even the <HI>Carmelites</HI> wear them in <HI>France</HI> as well as in <HI>Spain.</HI> But as to Women, it is rather a Fa&s;hion which they follow, than any Frugality; for they are neither Covetous nor good Hou&s;ewifes, and of the&s;e things, they have two or three new ones in a Week. The&s;e upper Garments are &s;o long before and on the &s;ides, that they draw a great deal upon the ground, but behind, they do not draw at all. Though they wear them down &s;o low, yet they will tread upon them, that their Feet may not be &s;een, which are the parts they mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly hide. I have heard &s;ay, that after a Lady has Oblig'd her Gallant by all po&s;&s;ible Civilities and Compliance, to confirm to him her Kindne&s;s, &s;he will &s;hew him her foot; and
<PB N="143" REF="74"> this here, they call the highe&s;t Favour; one mu&s;t needs own, that in its kind, there is nothing prettier. As I have already told you their Feet are &s;o &s;mall, that their Shooes look like tho&s;e of our Babies. They are made of black <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather, cut upon colour'd Taffety, without Heels, and as &s;trait as a Glove. When they go, you would think they flew; we &s;hould not in a hundred Years learn their way of walking; they keep their Elbows clo&s;e to their &s;ides, and go without rai&s;ing their Feet, ju&s;t as one &s;lides. But to return to their Habits; under this plain upper Garment, they have a dozen more, one finer, than another, of rich Stuffs, and trim'd with Galloons and Lace of Gold and Silver, to the Girdle. That I have told you a dozen, pray do not think that I exceed the Truth: During the exce&s;&s;ive Heats of the Summer, they only wear &s;even or eight, of which &s;ome are of Velvet, and others of thick Sattin. They wear at all times a white Garment under all the re&s;t, which they call <HI>Sabengua;</HI> it is made either of the fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace, or of Mu&s;lin embroider'd with Gold, and &s;o wide, that they are four Ells in compa&s;s. I have &s;een of the&s;e worth five or &s;ix hundred Crowns. At home they wear neither the little Vertin|gale nor Patens, the&s;e la&s;t are a &s;ort of little Sandal, made of Brocado or Velvet, &s;et upon Plates of Gold, which rai&s;e them half a Foot, and when they have the&s;e, they walk very ill, and are apt to fall. They u&s;e but very little Whale-bone in their Stays, the mid&s;t of which are a third part of an Ell. One can hardly &s;ee in other Countries Women &s;o &s;lender. They &s;hape their Bodies before pretty high, but behind, you may &s;ee them to the middle of the back, they are &s;o naked, and yet this is no Charming &s;ight, for they are all dreadful lean, though they would be very &s;orry to be fat. And this is a great Error among them. Be&s;ides, they are very &s;warthy; &s;o that this brown Skin which is glew'd to their backs, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;|plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who are not us'd to it. They put <HI>Red</HI> upon their Shouldiers, which are all naked, as well as on their Cheeks. Neither do they want there for <HI>White,</HI> which is very good, but there are few which know how to u&s;e it; at fir&s;t &s;ight you can di&s;cern it. I have &s;een &s;ome of a very clear Com|plexion that was Natural. Mo&s;t of them have very fine and exact Features; in their Looks and all their Actions you may &s;ee a little affectation of being Courted, which their Humour does not di&s;&s;emble. It's reckon'd beautiful among them to have no Brea&s;ts, and they take care very early to hinder them from growing big. As &s;oon as they begin to appear, they bind thin pieces of Lead upon them, as clo&s;e as one would &s;waddle a Child.
<PB N="142" REF="75"> And indeed their Brea&s;ts are as flat and even as a &s;heet of Pa|per, except the holes and hollowne&s;s, which their leanne&s;s cau&s;es, and tho&s;e are pretty many. Their hands have no de|fect, they are little, white, and well &s;hap'd. Their large Sleeves, which they fa&s;ten at the bottom of their wri&s;ts, &s;till contribute to make them appear le&s;s. The&s;e Sleeves are made of Taffety of all colours, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> with Ruffles of broad Lace. Their Stays are commonly of Gold and Silver Stuffs, mix'd with lively colours; the Sleeves of them are very &s;trait, and their Silk Sleeves appear in&s;tead of their Shifts. Never|thele&s;s, People of Quality wear very fine Linnen; but all others wear little or none. It is &s;carce and dear, be&s;ides, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have that fooli&s;h Vanity to de&s;ire it very fine; in&s;o|much, that they had rather have but one &s;uch Shift than half a dozen a little coar&s;e; and either lye in Bed till 'tis wa&s;h'd, or el&s;e dre&s;s them&s;elves without any, which they frequently enough do. They u&s;e this fine Linnen after an ill manner when they wa&s;h it; for the Women lay it upon rough &s;tones, and &s;o beat it hard with a &s;tick, by which means, there &s;hall be a hundred holes in't immediately. There's no difference between the be&s;t and the wor&s;t Laundre&s;s; all the&s;e Creatures are very auk|ward.</P>
<P>But I return to the Womens Cloaths, which I have often left, that I might give an Account of &s;everal things which oc|cur'd to me. I mu&s;t tell you, that they wear about their Necks Bone-lace, embroider'd over either with red or green Silk, or Gold or Silver. They wear Girdles all of Medals and Reliques. There are divers <HI>Churches</HI> which have not &s;o many; they wear al&s;o the Cord of &s;ome <HI>Order,</HI> either of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the <HI>Carmi|lites,</HI> or &s;ome other. It is a &s;mall Cord, made either of black, white, or brown Wool, and is worn on the out-&s;ide of their Stays, and hangs down before to the edge of their Petticoats. They are full of knots, and commonly upon every knot there's a Diamond-&s;tone fa&s;tned. They make Vows to &s;ome Saint or other to wear their Cords; but if the rea&s;on of the&s;e Vows was enquir'd into, it would not be found very good.</P>
<P>They have great &s;tore of <HI>Jewels,</HI> the fine&s;t that can be &s;een. Neither is it enough to have one Sett of <HI>Jewels,</HI> as our Ladies in <HI>France</HI> have, but the&s;e mu&s;t have Eight or Ten; &s;ome of <HI>Diamonds,</HI> others of <HI>Rubies, Emeralds, Pearls, Turkey-&s;tones;</HI> and in &s;hort, of all &s;orts. But the Work-men &s;et them very ill, for the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Diamond</HI> is hid, very little of it is &s;een. I ask'd the rea&s;on of it, and they told me, that to them, the Gold look'd as well as the Stones. But I am of
<PB N="145" REF="75"> Opinion, that their Lapidaries do not under&s;tand how to &s;et &s;et them better. I mu&s;t except <HI>Verbec,</HI> who can do them well if he will take the pains.</P>
<P>The Ladies wear at the top of their Stays a broad knot of <HI>Diamonds,</HI> from whence there hangs a Chain of <HI>Pearl,</HI> or ten or twelve knots of <HI>Diamonds,</HI> which they fa&s;ten at the other end, to their &s;ides. They never wear any Necklace, but they wear Bracelets, Rings, and Pendants; which la&s;t are longer than ones Hand, and &s;o heavy, that I hare wonder'd how they could carry them without tearing out the hole of their Ears. To which they add whatever they think pretty. I have &s;een &s;ome have good large Watches hanging there, others Padlocks of Precious Stones, and even your fine wrought <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Keys, and little Bells. They al&s;o carry upon their Sleeves, their Shoul|ders, and all about their Bodies, <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> and little Images. They have their Heads &s;tuck full of Bodkins, &s;ome made of Diamonds in the &s;hape of a Flye, and others like Butterflies, who&s;e colours are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by various Stones. They dre&s;s their Heads after &s;everal Fa&s;hions, but &s;till they mu&s;t be naked; they part their Hair on the &s;ides of their Heads, and lay it cro&s;s on their foreheads; it &s;hines &s;o, that without lying, one may &s;ee them&s;elves in it. Formerly they wore a Tre&s;s or Lock of Hair, the wor&s;t made that one &s;hould &s;ee, and this fell all &s;pread upon their Shoulders, le&s;t their own Hair &s;hould mix with it, which indeed is very fine. They have u&s;ually five-broided Rolls, to which they fa&s;ten Knots of Ribbons, or el&s;e Pearls, and the&s;e they tye altogether to their Girdles, and in Summer when they are at home, they wrap them up in a piece of co|lour'd Taffety, trim'd with Thred Bonelace. They never wear any &s;ort of Coif, either Night or Day. I have &s;een &s;ome which had their Heads dre&s;t up with Feathers like little Children: The&s;e Feathers are very curious, and &s;potted with different co|lours, which make them much more beautiful. I cannot ima|gine, why they do not make &s;uch in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Young Women, or new-marry'd, have very Rich Cloaths, and their upper Garments are colour'd and embroider'd with Gold. I was to &s;ee the Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon:</HI> She's a little Body, not above Thirteen Years old, and &s;he is lately marry'd to her Cou&s;in-German, named <HI>Don Nicholas Pignatelli;</HI> her Mother is the Daughter of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> nomi|nated to be <HI>Camarera major,</HI> or fir&s;t Maid of Honour to the new Queen. The&s;e, that is to &s;ay, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra No|va, D'Hijar,</HI> and <HI>Monteleon,</HI> with the Young Prince&s;s of the &s;ame Name, and her little Si&s;ters, dwell all altogether. The Dut|che&s;s
<PB N="146" REF="76"> of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> may be about Three&s;core Years old; my Kin&s;woman is one of her intimate Friends, and &s;he receiv'd us with &s;uch Civility and Kindne&s;s as is not u&s;ual with her: For it may be, there is not in the World a more haughty Spirit, which her very looks declare. Her voice is har&s;h, &s;he &s;peaks little, and would be thought of a kind and good Nature; but if what is &s;aid, be true, &s;he is not really &s;o: One &s;hall hardly meet with a greater &s;hare of Wit, and a more piercing Judg|ment, than &s;he has; &s;he di&s;cours'd to us much of the Place &s;he was going to take upon her in the Queen's Hou&s;e. Says &s;he, I'll neglect nothing to make my &s;elf acceptable to her, I'll en|deavour to di&s;cover every thing that may plea&s;e her; I am &s;en|&s;ible that a Young Prince&s;s, born in <HI>France,</HI> mu&s;t be allow'd a greater Liberty than an <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> born at <HI>Madrid.</HI> So that by me, &s;he &s;hall not be able to find any difference be|twixt this and her own Country. She pre&s;ented me with a pair of Beads of <HI>Paulo D'Aguila,</HI> which is a curious &s;ort of Wood that comes from the <HI>Indies.</HI> Really they are &s;o long, that when I hold them in my hands they reach to the ground. They are trim'd with two bunches of &s;mall green Taffety Ribbon, each bunch has about three hundred Ells in it. She gave me al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Puoatos</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which are Pots and Di&s;hes made of that Medicinal Earth, and are adorn'd with Filigrane Work: And &s;he pre&s;ented me likewi&s;e with &s;everal other pretty Toys.</P>
<P>One can hardly &s;ee any thing that looks more &s;plendid than this Hou&s;e of theirs; they u&s;e the upper Apartments, which are hung with Tapi&s;try all done with rais'd Work of Gold. In one great Chamber, which is longer than 'tis broad, you may &s;ee &s;everal Gla&s;s-doors which go into Clo&s;ets or little Cells. The fir&s;t of which is the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova</HI>'s, hung with grey, and a Bed of the &s;ame, and all other things very plain. On one &s;ide Lodges her Daughter, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who is a Widow, and has her Room furni&s;h'd like her Mother's. Afterwards you come to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Chamber, which is not larger than the others, but her Bed is of Gold and green Damask, lin'd with Silver-Brocade, and trim'd with Point <HI>De Spain.</HI> The Sheets were lac'd about with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace of half an Ell deep. Over again&s;t it were the Chambers of <HI>Monteleon and Hijar</HI>'s Children, which were Furni&s;h'd with white Damask. Next to the&s;e is the little Chamber of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hijar,</HI> Furni&s;h'd with Crim&s;on-colour'd Velvet upon a Gold Ground. Their Rooms were no otherwi&s;e divided than by Partitions of a certain Sweet Wood; and they told me, that &s;ix of their Women lay in their Chambers, upon Beds brought thither at Night.</P>
<PB N="147" REF="76">
<P>The Ladies were in a great Gallery, &s;pread with a very rich Foot-cloth; there were &s;et round it Crim&s;on-colour'd Velvet Cu&s;hions embroider'd with Gold, and they are longer than they are broad: There were al&s;o &s;everal great Cabinets in laid and a|dorn'd with Precious Stones, but they are not made in <HI>Spain;</HI> and between them were Tables of Silver, and admirable Look|ing-Gla&s;&s;es, both for their largene&s;s and rich Frames, the wor&s;t of which were of Silver. But that which I thought fine&s;t, were their <HI>E&s;caparates,</HI> which is a certain &s;ort of a clo&s;e Cabinet with one great Gla&s;s, and fill'd with all the Rarities which one can imagine, whether it be in <HI>Amber-grea&s;e, Porceline, Cry&s;tal, Bezoar-&s;tone, Branches of Coral, Mother of Pearl, Fillagran in Gold,</HI> and a thou&s;and other things of Value. There I &s;aw a Fi&s;h, and upon its Head there was a little Tree; it was neither of Wood nor of Mo&s;s; it grew on the top of the Fi&s;h's &s;cull, which is very &s;mall. This &s;eem'd to me a great Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>We were above three&s;core Women in this Gallery, and not &s;o much as one Man among us. They all &s;at down upon the Floor cro&s;s-legg'd. This is an Old Cu&s;tom, which they have deriv'd from the <HI>Moors.</HI> There was only one great Elbow-Chair of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather &s;titch'd with Silk, and very ugly. I ask'd for whom it was de&s;ign'd? They told me it was for the Prince of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who came not in till after all the Ladies were retir'd. I could not long &s;it after this fa&s;hion, and there|fore I got &s;ome Cu&s;hions under me, five or &s;ix of which were fa&s;tned together by a Silver brace full of Olive-&s;tones, that it might not break through. When any Lady comes to Vi&s;it, the <HI>He</HI> or <HI>She-Dwarf</HI> comes to give Notice, by kneeling down up|on one Knee, upon which all the Company ri&s;es, and the Young <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> walks before as far as the Door to receive her which comes to &s;ee her after her Marriage. In Saluting each other, they do not ki&s;s, perhaps, that is, becau&s;e they will not rub off the colour from one anothers Faces; but they &s;hake Hands with their Gloves off, and in Di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;ay <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee;</HI> and without calling one another either, <HI>Madam,</HI> or <HI>Lady,</HI> or <HI>High|ne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Excellency,</HI> they only &s;ay, <HI>Donna Maria, Donna Clara,</HI> or <HI>Donna There&s;a.</HI> I was willing to know the rea&s;on of this Familiar way, and I learnt it was to avoid all occa&s;ion of Offence a|mong&s;t them; and that as there were different ways of &s;peaking to di&s;tingui&s;h the great difference of Quality and Degree, and that it was not ea&s;ie to ob&s;erve all the Rules about them with|out &s;ometimes giving di&s;ta&s;te; therefore to prevent which, they have cho&s;en to &s;peak to each other without any Ceremo|ny at all. I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that the Women here do not in|termix,
<PB N="148" REF="77"> and &s;o the&s;e are always Per&s;ons of Quality together. The Wives of the Long Robe never &s;o much as go to vi&s;it the Court-Ladies, and a Man of Birth ever Marries with a Wo|man of Quality. Here one never &s;ees tho&s;e which are not Gentlemen mix with the Nobility, as in <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that there can be little danger, as long as they A&s;&s;ociate together. If there comes in a hundred Ladies one after another, every one ri&s;es up as often, and they go, as in Proce&s;&s;ion, as far as the Anti-Chamber to receive them. I was &s;o tyr'd that day, that I was in a very ill Humour.</P>
<P>They were all very well dre&s;s'd; and as I have already told you, they have very rich Cloaths, and their Jewels are extream fine. There were two Tables for the Game of <HI>Ombro,</HI> at which they play'd very high, and without any Noi&s;e. I could not un|der&s;tand their Cards; they are as thin as Paper, and painted after a quite different way from ours. One of tho&s;e Cards looks as if one held a Letter; when they have a good Game in Hand, it were ea&s;ie for a Cheating Game&s;ter to di&s;cover &s;everal of their Cards, if not the whole Game.</P>
<P>While they play'd, they di&s;cours'd of News, of the Court and the City: Their Conver&s;ation is free and plea&s;ant, and it mu&s;t needs be confe&s;s'd, that they have a certain quickene&s;s of Wit, which we cannot come up to. They are very kind and friend|ly; they love to prai&s;e, and do it after a gentile way, very in|geniou&s;ly, and with great Judgment. I am amaz'd to find &s;uch &s;trength of Memory joyn'd with &s;o great a degree of Wit and Under&s;tanding. They are compa&s;&s;ionate, even almo&s;t to a fault. They Read little and Write not much; but yet by that little which they do Read, they improve much, and that little they Write is both exact and conci&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Features are very regular and delicate; but their ex|ce&s;&s;ive leanne&s;s offends one that is not us'd to it. They are of a brown Complexion, and their faces very &s;mooth: The Small-Pox mu&s;t needs not do them &s;o much hurt here, as in other Countries, for I have &s;eldom &s;een any mark'd with them.</P>
<P>Their Hair is as black as Jett, and very &s;hining, notwith&s;tan|ding there is cau&s;e to think that they comb long with one and the &s;ame Comb, for t'other day I &s;aw at the Merchione&s;s of <HI>Al|connizas</HI> (who is Si&s;ter to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> and who&s;e fir&s;t Husband was the Count and Duke of <HI>Olivares</HI>) her Toylet &s;pread; and although &s;he is one of the neate&s;t and riche&s;t La|dies, and the Toylet was laid upon a little Silver Table, yet it was only furni&s;h'd with a little bit of Callico, a Looking-Gla&s;s no bigger than ones Hand, two Combs, and a little Box, and
<PB N="149" REF="77"> in a &s;mall <HI>China</HI> Cup &s;ome White of an Egg beat together with Sugar-candy. I ask'd one of her Women what &s;he did with this; &s;he told me, this was to take the dirt off her Face, and to make it &s;hine. I have &s;een &s;ome who&s;e Faces were &s;o bright, that you would wonder. One would think that they were Var|ni&s;h'd over; and the Skin is &s;o pull'd and rub'd, that I am con|fident it does a great deal of hurt. Mo&s;t of the Women make them&s;elves Eye-brows, and they have only as 'twere a little thred of Hair, which in my mind looks very ugly; but that which is yet wor&s;e, is, they comb the middle of their Fore|heads &s;o much till they make their Eye-brows meet; and this with them is extream Beautiful.</P>
<P>But yet there are a great many who&s;e Fancies do not lye this way; I have &s;een &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women more exact to the Rules of Beauty than our <HI>French</HI> Women, notwith&s;tanding their way of dre&s;&s;ing cro&s;s-wi&s;e, and the little Advantage which they give to their faces. One may &s;ay, that they are like things made out of Rule, for they have neither Hair, nor Cornet, nor any Ribbon, to &s;et them off; and yet, what Country can &s;hew &s;uch Eyes as theirs? They are &s;o very &s;prightly, and declare &s;o much Wit, and by them, talk to one in a Language &s;o kind and intelligible, that if they had no other Charms, the&s;e alone would make them pa&s;s for hand&s;om Women, and unavoidably &s;teal away ones Affections. Their Teeth are very even, and would be white enough, if they took a little care of them, but they neglect them; and be&s;ides, their frequent u&s;e of <HI>Sugar</HI> and <HI>Chocolate</HI> does them much hurt. They have all a bad Cu|&s;tom here, the Women as well as the Men, which is to pick their Teeth, let them be in what Company they will: This they reckon as a Diver&s;ion, and do it with grave looks. They do not &s;o much as know what belongs to having them clean'd by an Arti&s;t, there is no &s;uch Trade there, and when they need them to be drawn out, they get the Surgeons to do it, if they can.</P>
<P>At my fir&s;t coming in to Vi&s;it the <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> I was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee &s;o many Young Ladies with great Specta|cles on their No&s;es, and fa&s;tned to their Ears; but that which yet &s;eem'd &s;trange&s;t to me, was, that they made no u&s;e of them where it was nece&s;&s;ary: They only di&s;cours'd while they had them on; I was di&s;turb'd at it, and ask'd the Marchione&s;s <HI>De la Ro&s;a</HI> (with whom I have contracted a dear Friend&s;hip) the rea|&s;on of it: She's a pretty &s;ort of Woman, and under&s;tands how to live. She has a neat Wit, and is a <HI>Neapolitan.</HI> She fell a
<PB N="150" REF="78"> Laughing at my Que&s;tion, and told me, that it was done to make them look grave, that they did not wear them for any need, but to draw Re&s;pect. Do you &s;ee that Lady, &s;ays &s;he to me? meaning one that was near us, I do not believe, that &s;ince &s;he was Ten Years Old, &s;he ever left them off, but when &s;he went to Bed. Without lying, they both eat with them, and in the Streets and A&s;&s;emblies you can never fail of meeting a|bundance of Men and Women with their Spectacles. Upon this occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t needs tell you, continu'd &s;he, that &s;ome|time ago, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Fryars had a Suit in Law of high Im|portance; the &s;ucce&s;s of which they were too much concerned for, to neglect any means. One of the Young <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Convent had &s;ome Kindred of the greate&s;t Quality, which upon his Account did &s;ollicit very hard on their behalf. The <HI>Prior</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd him, that if through his Credit and Intere&s;t they &s;hould get the better of the Suit, he could ask nothing that &s;hould not be granted him for an Acknowledgment: At la&s;t, they gain'd their Point, and the Young Father, tran&s;ported with Joy, im|mediately ran to tell the News, and at the &s;ame time prepar'd him&s;elf to ask a Favour which a long time he had had a migh|ty de&s;ire to obtain. But the <HI>Prior,</HI> after having embrac'd him, with grave looks and tone, &s;aid to him, <HI>Hermano, ponga las Ojalas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Brother, put on Spectacles.</HI> The Honour of this Permi&s;&s;ion filled the Young Monk with a &s;trange Joy; he thought him&s;elf and his care too highly recompens'd, and had nothing el&s;e to ask. The Marque&s;s of <HI>A&s;torgas,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> added &s;he, had his Statue to the middle cut in Marble, upon which he was very careful to cau&s;e his be&s;t Spectacles to be put. It is &s;o common a thing to wear them, that I have heard, there are different Spectacles, according to the different Qualities and Degrees of Men and Women. Pro|portionably as a Man's Fortune ri&s;es, he increa&s;es in the large|ne&s;s of his Spectacle-Gla&s;&s;es, and wears them higher upon his No&s;e. The <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> wear them as broad as ones Hand, which for di&s;tinction, they call <HI>Ocales.</HI> They fa&s;ten them be|hind their Ears, and leave them off as &s;eldom as they do their Collars. Heretofore they had the Gla&s;&s;es of them from <HI>Venice;</HI> but ever &s;ince the Enterprize of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Cueva,</HI> which was called the <HI>Triumvirat,</HI> becau&s;e they were three Per&s;ons who undertook to Fire the Ar&s;enal of <HI>Venice</HI> with Burning-Gla&s;&s;es, and by this means to make the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Ma&s;ter of that City: The <HI>Venetians,</HI> to be reveng'd, caus'd a va&s;t number of tho&s;e <HI>Ocales</HI> to be made, and &s;ent to their Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Ma|drid.</HI> He pre&s;ented of them to the whole Court, and all that
<PB N="151" REF="78"> us'd them were almo&s;t blinded with them; for they were made of burning Gla&s;s, and very artificially done, and &s;et in certain Frames made of combu&s;tible Matter, which with the lea&s;t Rays of the Sun would put all in a Flame. It happen'd upon a Council-day, that in the Room where they &s;at, one of the Windows was left open, and the Sun &s;hining perpendicularly upon their Spectacles, all on a &s;udden they perceiv'd a dange|rous &s;ort of fire contriv'd again&s;t their Eye-brows and Hair; one can hardly imagine what a fright the&s;e venerable old men were in. I could wi&s;h, &s;aid I to the <HI>Marchione&s;s,</HI> that this &s;to|ry were credible, for 'tis very plea&s;ant. As I did not &s;ee it, re|ply'd &s;he in &s;miling, &s;o I cannot po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure you that 'tis true: But the bus'ne&s;s of the <HI>Jacobite Fryars</HI> which I have rela|ted to you, I had from the be&s;t Authority. I have &s;ince, ob|&s;erv'd &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality in their Coaches, &s;ometimes alone, and &s;ometimes in Company, with the&s;e great Spectacles hung upon their No&s;es, which in my Mind, is a &s;trange &s;ight.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s gave us a Collation, her Women, to the num|ber of eighteen, brought every one of them a great Silver Ba|&s;on full of dry Sweet-meats, wrapt up in Paper, for that pur|po&s;e cut and gilt. In one, there was a Plum, in another a Cherry or an Apricock, and &s;o in all the re&s;t accordingly. This to me &s;eem'd very neat, for by this way, one might either eat or carry away, without &s;oyling the Fingers or Pockets. There were &s;ome ancient Ladies, who after they had eat of the&s;e Sweet-meats till they were ready to bur&s;t, fill'd five or &s;ix Handkerchiefs full, and they bring them on purpo&s;e; and al|though they are well ob&s;erv'd, yet no notice &s;eems to be taken, but they are &s;uffer'd to take as much and as oft as they will; they tye the&s;e Handkerchiefs with &s;trings quite round their lit|tle Vertingales: This is like the hook which is us'd in a Pan|try, upon which is hung all &s;orts of Fle&s;h and Fowl. After|wards they pre&s;ent you with Chocolate, every one a China Cup full upon a little Di&s;h of Agat &s;et in Gold, with Sugar in a Box of the &s;ame. There was &s;ome Chocolate order'd with Ice, and &s;ome hot, and &s;ome made with Milk and Eggs: One drinks it with &s;ome Bisket, or el&s;e with &s;ome thin bread as hard as if it were toa&s;ted, which they make &s;o on purpo&s;e. There are &s;ome Women which will drink &s;ix Cups one after another, and this they do, very often twice or thrice a day. One &s;hould not wonder that they are &s;o dry, &s;ince nothing is hotter than this Liquor; and be&s;ides, they eat every thing &s;o very high &s;ea|&s;on'd with Pepper and Spice, that one would think it impo&s;&s;ible they are not burnt up: There were &s;everal al&s;o, which eat
<PB N="152" REF="79"> great pieces of the Medicinal Earth. I have already told you, that they have even a great pa&s;&s;ion for this Earth, which fre|quently cau&s;es in them great Ob&s;tructions; their Stomachs and their Bellies will be &s;well'd with it, and become as hard as a Stone, and they them&s;elves as yellow as Saffron. I had a mind to ta&s;te this <HI>Ragoue</HI> which is &s;o much e&s;teem'd beyond its worth, but I declare I had rather eat a piece of a Stone.</P>
<P>If one had a mind to oblige them, one mu&s;t treat them with &s;uch kind of things which they call <HI>Barros;</HI> and very often their Confe&s;&s;ors enjoyns them no other <HI>Penance,</HI> than to for|bear one whole day from eating thereof. It is &s;aid to have a great many Properties; and is good again&s;t Poy&s;on, and cures abundance of Di&s;ea&s;es. I have a great Cup made of it, which holds a pint; it &s;poils Wine that's put into it, but it makes Water excellent, which &s;eems as if it boyl'd in it, at lea&s;t one may ob&s;erve it to work and fret, if it is proper to &s;ay &s;o; and if one leaves it a little while, the Cup &s;hall be quite empty, the nature of the Earth makes it &s;o full of Pores; it has a &s;trong &s;ent. We drank Water there, which was very well order'd; one may truly &s;ay, that in no place they drink it cooler: They make u&s;e only of Snow, and are of Opinion that it cools much better than Ice; It is the cu&s;tom here to drink very cold Water before they take their Chocolate, which otherwi&s;e they think would be unwhol&s;om.</P>
<P>After the Collation was ended, Flamboys were brought in; there came in fir&s;t a little &s;imple Fellow, white with Age, who was Governour of the Pages: He had a great Gold Chain and a Medal about his Neck; this was the pre&s;ent he had at the Prince of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Marriage: He kneel'd down upon one Knee in the middle of the Gallery, and aloud, &s;aid, <HI>Let the Mo&s;t Holy Sacrament be prais'd;</HI> to which every body an&s;wer'd, <HI>For ever:</HI> This is their Cu&s;tom, when Light is brought in. Next came in four and twenty Pages following two by two; and in the &s;ame manner kneel'd upon one Knee; every one of them brought two great Flamboys, or one Branch, and when they had plac'd them upon the Tables, went out with the &s;ame Ce|remony. And then all the Ladies made to each other a low bow, accompany'd with a wi&s;h, as when they &s;neeze. It is fit I &s;hould tell you, that the&s;e Branches are full of Lamps fa&s;tned to a &s;ilver Pillar, who&s;e foot is very broad; there are mo&s;t times eight and twelve Pipes to every Lamp, in which the Week burns, &s;o that this gives a very great Light. And to encrea&s;e it yet more, they fa&s;ten a &s;ilver Plate to it, in &s;uch manner, that the Light reflects upon it. One is not troubled
<PB N="153" REF="79"> with the Smoak, and the Oyl they burn is altogether as good as that of <HI>Provence,</HI> which is eat with Sallads. I lik'd this fa&s;hion very well. When all the Lights were put in their proper pla|ces in the Gallery, the young Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon</HI> bid her Wo|men bring her Wedding-cloaths, that I might &s;ee them; they brought thirty &s;ilver Baskets full, which were as deep and as wide, as Table Baskets; they were &s;o heavy, that there were four Women to carry one Basket. In them there was, what ever is po&s;&s;ible to be &s;een that is fine and rich, according to the fa&s;hion of the Country; among&s;t other things, there were &s;ix of a certain &s;ort of clo&s;e Coat of Gold and Silver Brocard, made like Ve&s;ts to wear in a Morning, with Buttons, &s;ome of Diamonds, and others of Emeralds, and of the&s;e every one had &s;ix dozen. The Linnen and the Lace were not inferiour to the re&s;t. She &s;hew'd me her Jewels al&s;o, which were admirable, but &s;o ill &s;et, that the bigge&s;t there made no better a &s;hew than a Jewel &s;et in <HI>Paris,</HI> which one might buy for thirty <HI>Lew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I will not write to you often, becau&s;e I will always have a &s;tock of News to tell you, which in this place, is pretty long in picking up. Pardon this tedious Letter, and the little Me|thod which I have ob&s;erv'd in it; I &s;et things down ju&s;t as they come into my Mind, and that's ill enough; but in your Love, dear Co&s;in, I am &s;afe from all my faults.</P>

<P>I Fear you'll take it ill that I have omitted writing to you one Po&s;t; but dear Cou&s;in, I was willing to be inform'd of divers things, which I am now going to relate.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I will &s;peak of the Churches of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which I find extream beautiful and neat: The Women of Quality &s;el|dom go to them, becau&s;e they all have their Chappels in their Hou&s;es; but there are certain days in the year, they never fail to be at them, of which number are all the days in the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-week;</HI> and there al&s;o they make their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Go to receive their Indulgences.</NOTE> <HI>Stations,</HI> and &s;ometimes go to Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="541" REF="80">
<P>Our Ladies Church of <HI>Atocha,</HI> that is to &s;ay, our Lady of the <HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> is indeed a very fine one. It &s;tands within a va&s;t <HI>Con|vent,</HI> which is fill'd with <HI>Religious</HI> Women, who &s;eldom or ne|ver go out of it, that being one of their Rules they are to ob|&s;erve. They lead an au&s;tere Life; and from all parts, People come to pay their Devotion here; and when the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have gain'd any Victories or happy Succe&s;s, thither they go to &s;ing <HI>Te Deum.</HI> There you'll &s;ee a <HI>Virgin</HI> holding a young <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> which they report to be miraculous. She's of a black Complexion, and very often they dre&s;s her up like a Widow; but upon great Fe&s;tivals &s;he is richly cloth'd, and &s;o adorn'd with Jewels, that nothing can be &s;een more magnificent. She hath in a particular manner the Sun drawn rown her Head, who&s;e Beams &s;hine admirably. She always has a va&s;t pair of Beeds either in her Hand, or hung at her Girdle. This Chap|pel is on one &s;ide of the body of the Church, and in &s;uch a place, as it would be very dark, were it not that there's conti|nually burning above an hundred great Lamps of Gold and Silver. The King has his Gallery there, who&s;e fore-part is made up with a Lattice Window. In all their Churches they make u&s;e of Ha&s;&s;ocks to kneel on; and when a Per&s;on of Qua|lity, or a &s;trange Lady comes in, the Sexton &s;preads a large Carpet before 'em, upon which he either &s;ets an Oratory with Cu&s;hions, or el&s;e he leads 'em to certain little Clo&s;ets, all painted and gilt, with Gla&s;s-windows round, where one is very conve|niently placed. There never fails a Sunday that the Altar is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">luminated with above an hundred thick Wax Candles. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">kewi&s;e adorn'd with a prodigious quantity of Plate, and &s;o are all the Churches in <HI>Madrid.</HI> Here are abundance of fine Walks made of your green Turf; and &s;et full of Flowers, in which they place a great many Fountains, from whence the Water falls into Ba&s;ins, either of Silver, or Marble, or Porphi|ry-&s;tone. Round about them they plant great numbers of Orange-Trees, as high as a Man, and the&s;e are &s;et in very fine Boxes; and among the&s;e they turn loo&s;e &s;everal Birds, which make a pretty &s;ort of Mu&s;ick. And this as I have de&s;cribed to you, la&s;ts almo&s;t all the year; neither are their Churches ever without Orange or Ja&s;&s;emin Trees, which perfume them much better than their Incen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Chappel which they call our Lords of <HI>Almunada,</HI> you &s;ee a <HI>Virgin,</HI> which they tell ye St. <HI>James</HI> brought from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> and hid in a Tower which is in the middle of <HI>Madrid.</HI> The <HI>Moors</HI> having be&s;ieg'd the City, the Inhabitants were redu|ced to &s;o great a want of Provi&s;ions, that they were delibera|ting
<PB N="155" REF="80"> to Surrender, when on a &s;udden they found this Tower full of Corn; they concluded &s;uch a plentiful and &s;ea&s;onable Supply could be no le&s;s than the effect of a Miracle; this fill'd them with Joy and new Courage, and made them &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly defend the City, that the <HI>Moors</HI> toyl'd with a long Siege, were forced to retire. Afterwards, they found the Image of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> and in gratitude, they built a Chappel for her, upon the Walls of which, this whole Hi&s;tory is painted in <HI>Fre&s;co.</HI> The Altar, Rayles, and all the Lamps are of &s;olid Silver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minime</HI> Fryars have a Church near this, in which is the Chappel of our <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Soledad,</HI> where the <HI>Salutation</HI> is every Night &s;aid; this is a place of great Devotion; I mean for tho&s;e that are truly devout, for there are a great many Per&s;ons which make it their Rendezvouz for other ends.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>I&s;idore</HI>'s Chappel &s;urpa&s;&s;es all in beauty. He is the Patron of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and he was but a poor Labourer. The Walls of the Chappel are all ca&s;ed with Marble of divers Colours, and its Pillars are of the &s;ame, and &s;o are &s;ome Statues of certain Saints: His Tomb is in the middle, and four Pillars of Porphi|ry &s;upports over it a Crown cut in Marble, in which are repre|&s;ented Flowers, who&s;e Colours are &s;o very natural, that one may &s;ay, Art has outdone Nature. The <HI>Cupulo</HI> without is adorn'd with the Images of the Twelve Apo&s;tles, which &s;tand round it.</P>
<P>I &s;aw at St. <HI>Seba&s;tines,</HI> (which at pre&s;ent is my Pari&s;h) a Canopy which the Queen-Mother caus'd to be made, for the carrying the Holy Sacrament to the Sick in bad Weather: It is made of Crim&s;on Velvet embroider'd with Gold; it is cover'd with Chagrin, and nail'd with Gold Nails; it has &s;everal great Gla&s;&s;es about it, and in the middle of its roof, there is rais'd a &s;ort of Steeple, which is full of little Bells of Gold, Four Prie&s;ts carry it when any Per&s;on of Quality is &s;ick, and de&s;ires to re|ceive the Sacrament, and all the People at Court attend it. There are about a thou&s;and Flamboys of white Wax to give Light, and &s;everal mu&s;ical In&s;truments play before it. They make &s;ome &s;tay at all the great Places in their way, to give leave to the People to kneel and receive the Benediction, and to let the Mu&s;icians play upon their Harps and Guittars, and &s;ing to them. It is generally in the Night time, that they car|ry it with &s;o much Ceremony and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When they are to celebrate a Fe&s;tival in &s;ome Church, the Evening before they &s;et up a long Pole fa&s;tned in the Ground, on the top of which is a kind of a deep Chaffing-di&s;h, which they fill with wooden Chips mixt with Brim&s;tone and Oyl:
<PB N="156" REF="81"> This burns a long while, and gives a very great Light; they place the&s;e Poles in the form of Allies, which make a delightful &s;ort of an Illumination.</P>
<P>The Women which go abroad to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> hear a dozen of them, but &s;hew &s;o much Di&s;traction and wandring of Thoughts, that one may ea&s;ily perceive their Minds are employ'd on &s;ome other thing than their Prayers. They wear Muffs that are above half an Ell long; they are made of the fine&s;t Martins and Sables which can be &s;een, and are worth 4 or 5 hundred Crowns a|piece. They mu&s;t &s;tretch back their Arms as far as po&s;&s;ible they can, to be able only to put their fingers ends into the entrance of their Muffs. I fancy, I have already told you that the Wo|men are extream little, and the&s;e Muffs are very little le&s;s than them&s;elves. They always wear a Fan too, and be it in Summer or Winter, they never cea&s;e fanning them&s;elves all the time of <HI>Ma&s;s.</HI> In the Church they all &s;it upon their Legs, and are con|tinually taking of Snuff, and yet never &s;mut them&s;elves with it, as 'tis u&s;ual; for in this, as in all other things, they have very neat and dextrous ways of management. Every time the <HI>Ele|vation</HI> is made, both the Women and Men give them&s;elves a &s;core of blows with their fi&s;ts upon their Brea&s;ts; which makes &s;uch a noi&s;e, that the fir&s;t time I heard it, I was very much af|frighted, and thought they were beating one another.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> (I mean tho&s;e which by Profe&s;&s;ion are Gallants, and wear a peice of Crape round their Hats) as &s;oon as <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> is ended, they march up to the place where the <HI>Holy Water</HI> is kept, and ranging them&s;elves round it, they pre&s;ent of it to all the Ladies, who al&s;o come thither, and at the &s;ame time &s;ay &s;omething to them that's kind; to which the Women make a pertinent an&s;wer in few words; for it mu&s;t needs be granted, that they &s;peak preci&s;ely what they &s;hould, and that <HI>ex tempore,</HI> without any trouble of &s;tudying for words. But the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Nuncio,</HI> has upon pain of Excommunication, forbid the Men to pre&s;ent the Women any <HI>Holy Water.</HI> And 'tis &s;aid, that this Prohibition was obtain'd at the Intreaty of &s;ome jealous Husbands. However it be, it is ob&s;erv'd, and they &s;ay, the Pro|hibition even forbids the Men to give each other any <HI>Holy Water.</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women be of what quality they will, they neither have Cu&s;hions in the Church, nor any kind of Train held up. For our parts, as &s;oon as we appear there in our <HI>French</HI> Cloaths, every body gets round about us; but the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome of all, are the big belly'd Women, which are more inqui&s;itive than the others, and for whom they have here, the
<PB N="157" REF="81"> greate&s;t re&s;pect and complai&s;ance; for 'tis pretended, that if they long for any thing, and mi&s;s of it, they receive &s;o much hurt, that they immediately mi&s;carry; &s;o that they have a liber|ty to pull off ones Gloves, and to tugg, hale, and examine every body as they li&s;t.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I could not take &s;uch kind of Je&s;ting, and talkt to them &s;o roughly, that &s;ome of them went away weeping, and dur&s;t not return: But there were others which were not &s;o ea|&s;ily put out of Countenance; they would &s;ee my Shooes, my Garters, and what I had in my Pocket; my Kin&s;women &s;eeing I would not permit them, told me that if the People once took notice of me, they would certainly &s;tone us, and bid me let them have their humour. My Women and Chamber-maids were yet wor&s;e tormented than I; and I am a&s;ham'd to tell you, how far the curio&s;ity of the&s;e big-belly'd Women proceeded.</P>
<P>I was told that there was a young man at Court, who was de&s;perately in love with a very fine Woman, who&s;e Husband continually kept under his Eyes; &s;o that finding no other way to &s;peak to her, he di&s;guis'd him&s;elf like a Woman big with Child, and &s;o went to her Hou&s;e; he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the jealous Husband, and told him, he had the <HI>Lantajo</HI> (which is the word for Longing) to di&s;cour&s;e with his Wife in private. The Husband deceiv'd by this appearance, made no que&s;tion that this was a young big belly'd Woman, and immediately con&s;ented that his Wife &s;hould make this Per&s;on happy with a long and plea&s;ant audience.</P>
<P>When any of the&s;e Women long to &s;ee the King, they give him notice of it, and he has the Goodne&s;s to come into a great Balcon, which looks into the Palace Court, and there he tarries as long as they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman ju&s;t come from <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;ent to beg the King that &s;he might &s;ee him, and when &s;he had lookt upon him as long as &s;he had a mind, in a tran&s;port of Zeal, with hands lifted up, &s;he &s;aid to him, <HI>I be&s;eech God, Sir, that of his Mercy, he would one day make you Vice Roy of Naples.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, that this Pa&s;&s;age was acted before the King, to inform us, that the Magnificence of the then <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> who was not be|lov'd, far exceeded his. Very frequently there comes into my Relation's Hou&s;e, Women which are perfect Strangers, to whom neverthele&s;s &s;he is very kind and civil, becau&s;e they are big with Child, and &s;uch we mu&s;t not vex.</P>
<P>Thanks to Heaven, Lent is over, and though I only ob&s;erv'd the Pa&s;&s;ion-Week, yet that was more tedious to me, than a whole Lent kept at <HI>Paris,</HI> for there's no Butter here; that little
<PB N="158" REF="82"> which one meets with, is brought about Thirty Leagues off, wrapt up like Sau&s;ages in Hoggs Bladders. It is full of Worms, and very dear. But the Oyl makes amends, for 'tis very excellent; only you know, every body loves it not, and I am one of tho&s;e, which cannot eat it, without being very &s;ick.</P>
<P>That which makes it yet wor&s;e here, is, that Fi&s;h is very &s;carce; it is impo&s;&s;ible to have any &s;weet which is caught in the Sea, for that is di&s;tant from <HI>Madrid</HI> above Four&s;core Leagues. Sometimes there is Salmon brought, of which they make Pies, which being &s;ea&s;on'd with Spice and Saffron, is eatable. There's very little Fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h, and yet for all this, they do not &s;uffer much Inconvenience, for indeed, there's hardly any body keeps Lent, neither Ma&s;ter nor Servant, becau&s;e of the great want of Provi&s;ions. They take a Licen&s;e from the Pope's <HI>Nun|cio,</HI> which co&s;ts about a Shilling, which gives them leave to eat Butter and Chee&s;e all <HI>Lent,</HI> and the Heads, Feet, and Inwards of Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every Saturday throughout the Year. And it &s;eems to me pretty odd, that on this day they &s;hould eat the Feet, Head, and Inwards, and yet dare not eat of any other part of the &s;ame Creature.</P>
<P>The Shambles are as open in <HI>Lent,</HI> as they are in the <HI>Carna|val.</HI> Their way of &s;elling Meat is very trouble&s;om; it is clo&s;e &s;hut up in the Butcher's Shop, one &s;peaks to him through a little Window, and de&s;ires to buy of him half a Calf, or the like; he neither vouch&s;afes to an&s;wer you, nor to &s;hew you the lea&s;t bit of Meat; at la&s;t, you are content with a Loyn of Veal; but he makes you pay your Money down before-hand, and then through his little Window he gives you a Leg of Mutton; you return it, and tell him, this is not what you ask for; he takes it again, and in&s;tead thereof he gives you a &s;hort Rib of Beef; then you make a noi&s;e for your Loyn, but he concerns him&s;elf no further than to throw you your Money, and &s;hut the Win|dow upon you. This vexes one, and you go to another, and he treats you after the &s;ame manner, if not wor&s;e; &s;o that it is be&s;t, to tell them how much Meat you would have, and leave the re&s;t to them. This Fle&s;h is ill for the Stomach, it is &s;o lean, dry, and black; but as bad as 'tis, yet there's le&s;s requir'd of it than of ours in <HI>France,</HI> to make a good Soup. Every thing here nouri&s;hes &s;o extreamly, that an Egg does one more good than a Pigeon el&s;ewhere; and this I take to be an Effect of the Climate.</P>
<P>As to their Wine, it does not plea&s;e me; this is not the Coun|try where the Excellent <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine is drank, that comes from <HI>Andalou&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Canary-I&s;lands,</HI> which mu&s;t pa&s;s the Sea too,
<PB N="159" REF="82"> to gain that &s;trength and plea&s;antne&s;s which we find in it. At <HI>Madrid</HI> the Wine is &s;trong enough, if not too &s;trong, but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> wants that delicious ta&s;te. Add to this, that they keep it in Bags made of Buck-skin, and fitted up for that purpo&s;e, &s;o that it always &s;mells and ta&s;tes either of Pitch, or as if it was burnt. I now begin not to wonder that Men are &s;o temperate with &s;uch Liquor. They'll &s;ell as little a quantity of it as one will, even to the value of a <HI>French Double:</HI> But that which is &s;o retail'd out to the poor People, is yet made wor&s;e than it would be, by their letting it &s;tand all day in an open Earthen Ba&s;on, out of which they &s;ell to tho&s;e who have a mind. It grows &s;our, and &s;mells &s;o &s;trong, that it makes one's Head ake in pa&s;&s;ing by.</P>
<P>Lent makes no alteration in their Plea&s;ures, indeed they are &s;o moderate, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e they u&s;e make &s;o little noi&s;e, that they enjoy them at all times.</P>
<P>No body fails of going to their <HI>Station</HI> in Pa&s;&s;ion-Week, but particularly from Wedne&s;day to Fryday. In the&s;e three days, there is acted very different things, by real <HI>Penitents, Lovers,</HI> and <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> There are divers Women, which under pre|tence of Devotion, con&s;tantly go to certain Churches, where for a Year before, they are a&s;&s;ur'd to meet him they Love; and though they are attended with &s;everal of their Women, which they call <HI>Duennas,</HI> yet as the Crowds are great, and Love makes them ingenious, &s;o they make a &s;hift in &s;pight of all the <HI>Argus</HI>'s, to &s;lip on one &s;ide into a little adjoyning Hou&s;e, which by a private &s;ign they know, and is hired for that purpo&s;e, and without the help of any body, but at that very moment of time. When they have done, they return to the &s;ame Church, where they find their Women bu&s;ie in &s;earching for them; they fall a chiding them for their carele&s;ne&s;s in lo&s;ing them; and thus the Husband, who for a whole Year hath indu&s;triou&s;ly watch'd his dear Wife, lo&s;es her at that very &s;ea&s;on when &s;he is obliged to be the mo&s;t faithful to him: The great Con&s;traint they live under, puts violent de&s;ires in them to enjoy &s;ome freedom; and their very Amorous Nature makes them Witty to find out means to bring about their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>'Tis an unplea&s;ant thing to &s;ee the <HI>Di&s;ciplinarians:</HI> The fir&s;t time I met one of them I thought I &s;hould have &s;wooned a|way. The unexpectedne&s;s of &s;uch a terrible &s;ight &s;eized me; fancy a Man coming &s;o near you, that he'll cover you all over with his Blood; this, it &s;eems, is one of their Pa&s;times: there are certain Rules by which to Di&s;cipline them&s;elves hand&s;omly, and Ma&s;ters to teach the Art, ju&s;t as to Dance and to Fence. They have a &s;ort of a Gown made of their <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Cloth very
<PB N="160" REF="83"> fine, which comes down to their Shooes; it is laid in &s;mall plights, and &s;o prodigiou&s;ly wide, that it contains at lea&s;t fifty Ells of Cloth. They wear upon their Heads a Cap three times higher than a Sugar-loaf, and of the &s;ame &s;hape: It is cover'd with Holland, and from it falls a great piece of Cloth which hides all the Face and the fore-part of the Body; there's two little holes in't to &s;ee through: On the back of their Wa&s;tcoats they have two great holes upon their &s;houlders; they wear white Gloves and Shooes, and abundance of Ribbon which tyes their Wa&s;tcoat-&s;leeves, but hanging down, and not in knots. They al&s;o tye one to their Whip; commonly 'tis their Mi&s;tre&s;s which Honours them with this Favour: And to be the more admired, they mu&s;t not lift up their Arms, only the Wri&s;t and the Hand, and the blows mu&s;t not follow ha&s;tily, nor the Blood which runs out &s;poil their Cloaths. They give them|&s;elves mo&s;t terrible cutes and &s;la&s;hes upon their &s;houlders, from whence runs &s;treams of Blood. They walk &s;o &s;oftly in the Streets as if they counted their &s;teps; they pre&s;ent them&s;elves before their Mi&s;tre&s;s's Window, and there with wonderful pa|tience la&s;h them&s;elves. The Lady through the Lattice of her Chamber &s;ees this fine &s;ight, and by &s;ome &s;ign encourages her Gallant to Flea him&s;elf alive, and lets him know how very kind|ly &s;he takes this Action of his. When they meet a hand&s;om Woman, they whip them&s;elves after &s;uch a rate, as to make the Blood flye upon her: This is e&s;teemed a particular Civility, and the Lady acknowledges and thanks them for it. When once they have begun to give them&s;elves this Di&s;cipline, the pre&s;er|vation of their Health obliges them afterwards to u&s;e it every Year, otherwi&s;e they would be &s;ick. They have al&s;o little Needles &s;tuck in Sponges, with which they prick their &s;houl|ders and their &s;ides &s;o eagerly, as if it did not hurt them. But I'll tell you &s;omething yet &s;tranger. Several Courtiers often take this Walk in the Night: But they are commonly the Young Fools, and they give notice to all their Friends of their De&s;ign, who immediately come to them very well Arm'd. The Marque&s;s <HI>De Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> was one of them this Year, and the Duke <HI>De Vejar</HI> was the other. This Duke went out of his Hou&s;e about Nine a Clock at Night, he had a hundred Flam|boys of white Wax carry'd before him, two by two. Three|&s;core of his Friends went before, and a hundred follow'd after him, and every one had his Page and Footmen; and it was a very long Proce&s;&s;ion. It is known when Men of this Quality are to walk; &s;o that all the Ladies are in their Windows, and hang out their Carpets in their Balconies; and that they may
<PB N="161" REF="83"> the better &s;ee and be &s;een, they have Flamboys fa&s;tned to the &s;ides. The <HI>Knight of Di&s;cipline</HI> with his Guard, pa&s;&s;es along, and &s;alutes the Spectators. But that which often cau&s;es a great deal of Mi&s;chief, is, when the other <HI>Di&s;ciplinarian,</HI> who &s;tands upon his Honour and Reputation, marches with his great Com|pany in the &s;ame Street. This happen'd to the&s;e Per&s;ons I have now mentioned. Each of them would have the upper hand, and neither would yield it. The Footmen with their Flamboys began to lay one another over the Faces, and burn their Whiskers and Hair; the Friends of each Party drew their Swords again&s;t one another. Our two <HI>Heroes,</HI> who were only Arm'd with this In&s;trument of Penance, &s;earch for each other, and being met, being a mo&s;t terrible Battel. After they have us'd a little Di&s;cipline about one anothers Ears, and cover'd the Ground with the ends of their Whip-cords, they fall to down-right Fifty-cuffs like any Porters: Though after all, there's but little matter to laugh at in this piece of Mummery, for they beat one another well-favouredly; they wound, and often kill; and here old Enmities revive and are reveng'd. But at la&s;t, the Duke <HI>de Vejar</HI> yielded to the Marque&s;s <HI>De Villa Her|mo&s;a;</HI> they gather'd up their broken Whips, and mended them as well as they could: The great Cap, which was thrown into the <HI>Canal,</HI> was wip'd and put upon the <HI>Penitent</HI>'s Head again; the wounded were carried home, and the Proce&s;&s;ion began a|gain, and they walk'd more gravely than ever, through a great part of the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> had a great mind the next Morning to be reveng'd; but the <HI>King</HI> commanded both him and the <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> not to &s;tir out of their Hou&s;es. But to come to what they do upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions: You mu&s;t know, that after the&s;e Servants of <HI>God</HI> are return'd home, there's a magnificent Supper prepar'd of all &s;orts of Meats; and ob&s;erve that this is on the la&s;t day of <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion-Week:</HI> But after &s;o good a Work, they think they may do a little Evil. Immediately the <HI>Penitent</HI> cau&s;es his &s;houlders to be a long time rub'd with Sponges dipt in Vinegar and Salt, le&s;t there &s;hould remain any brui&s;ed Blood; after that, he &s;ets him&s;elf at the Table with his Friends, and receives from them the Elogies and Applau&s;es which he believes he has merited. Every one in his turn, tells him, that in the Memory of Man, none was ever &s;een to to receive the Di&s;cipline with &s;o good a grace. They magnifie all his Actions, but above all, the Hap|pine&s;s of that Lady for who&s;e &s;ake all this Bravery was per|form'd. The whole Night is &s;pent in &s;uch kind of Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;ometimes he that has been &s;o well flog'd, is &s;o &s;ick, that
<PB N="162" REF="84"> he cannot go to <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> on <HI>Ea&s;ter-day.</HI> Do not think that I u&s;e any Art to &s;et out the Hi&s;tory of this matter to make you merry, it is all literally true, and I tell you nothing, which you may not be &s;atisfied in, from every body that has been at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>But there are al&s;o true <HI>Penitents,</HI> which indeed troubles one extreamly to look on them; they are dre&s;t ju&s;t as tho&s;e who gives them&s;elves the <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> except that they are naked from the &s;houlders to the middle, and with a kind of a narrow Matt are &s;wadled and bound &s;o very hard, that all the Fle&s;h which appears is black and blew; their Arms &s;tretch'd out, are wrapt about with the &s;ame Matt. They carry to the number of &s;even Swords &s;ticking in their Backs and Arms, which hurt them grievou&s;ly when they &s;tir too much, or happen to fall, which they often do; for they going bare-foot, and the &s;tones in the Streets being &s;harp, and cutting their Feet, they cannot po&s;&s;i|bly always keep them&s;elves up. There are others, who in&s;tead of the&s;e Swords carry Cro&s;&s;es &s;o very heavy, that they are even born down with them; neither would I have you think that the&s;e are of the ordinary People, &s;ome of them are of the high|e&s;t Quality. They are forc'd to have &s;everal of their Servants to accompany them, but they are di&s;gui&s;ed, and their Faces co|vered, le&s;t they &s;hould be known. The&s;e carry Wine, Vine|gar, and other things, to give their Ma&s;ter from time to time, who very frequently drop down dead with the extream pain and toil they endure. Generally the&s;e <HI>Penances</HI> are enjoyn'd by their Confe&s;&s;ors, and they are &s;o very &s;evere, that he which undergoes them &s;eldom out-lives the Year. The Pope's <HI>Nuncio</HI> told me, that he had forbid all <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors</HI> to impo&s;e them; yet I have &s;een divers, though in likelihood it proceeded from their own Devotion.</P>
<P>From the beginning of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-Week</HI> to <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> one can|not &s;tir out of Door without &s;eeing an infinite number of <HI>Peni|tents</HI> of all &s;orts; and on <HI>Good-Friday</HI> they all come to the <HI>Pro|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which is but one general one for all the City, and is compo&s;ed of all the <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Convents.</HI> Upon this day, the Ladies are more finely dre&s;s'd than on their Wedding-days; they place them&s;elves in their Balconies, which are &s;et out with rich Carpets and Cu&s;hions. Sometimes there's above a hundred Women together. The Proce&s;&s;ion begins about four a Clock, and is not ended till pa&s;t eight; for I cannot expre&s;s to you the numberle&s;s Number of People I have &s;een, counting from the <HI>King, Don John,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals, Emba&s;&s;adors,</HI> the <HI>Grandees,</HI> the <HI>Courtezans,</HI> to all &s;orts of Folks, both of the Court and City. Every one holds a Wax-Candle in his Hand, and all their Ser|vants,
<PB N="163" REF="84"> which are numerous, carry Torches and Flamboys. In the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> all their Banners and Cro&s;&s;es are covered with Crape, and there's a va&s;t number of Drums covered with the &s;ame, and they beat, as at the Death of a General. The Trum|pets &s;ound &s;ome Melancholy Tune. The <HI>King</HI>'s Guards, which are four Companies of different Nations, to wit, <HI>Burgundians, Spaniards, Germans,</HI> and <HI>L'Ancillians,</HI> have their Arms covered with Mourning, and trail them upon the ground. There are certain Machines, &s;et upon Theatres, which repre&s;ent the My|&s;teries of the Life and Death of our Lord; the Figures are as big as Life, but very ill made and dre&s;t: There are &s;ome &s;o heavy, that a hundred Men can but lift them, of which there's a va&s;t number, for every Pari&s;h has &s;ome. I ob&s;erv'd that of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin</HI> flying into <HI>Egypt;</HI> &s;he was upon an A&s;s which had good Furniture; the Hou&s;ing was all over embroider'd with fine Pearls, the Figure was very great and heavy.</P>
<P>Here they are afraid le&s;t &s;ometimes the People &s;hould fail in their Devotion at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and therefore for that rea&s;on, each Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t goes to every Hou&s;e, and enquires of the Ma&s;ter, how many Communicants he has? Being informed, he notes the Number in his Book: To every one that has receiv'd the Communion, they give a Printed Certificate. After <HI>Low-Sunday</HI> they vi&s;it all the Hou&s;es again, and demand to &s;ee the Certifi|cates, which they ought to have according to the fir&s;t Account taken of them; and if they can &s;hew none, there's a &s;trict en|quiry made after him or her who has not Communicated. At this time the Poor who are &s;ick, hang out a Carpet at their Door, and the Sacrament is brought to them in a very fine and Devout Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since my being at <HI>Madrid,</HI> I have &s;een very few &s;tately Fu|nerals, except one for the Duke of <HI>Medina Celi</HI>'s Daughter. Her Coffin was made of rare <HI>Indian</HI> Wood, put into a blue Velvet Bag, and cro&s;t with &s;ilver Mohair, with Cords of &s;ilver Thred, and the &s;trings were of the &s;ame, and fa&s;tned the Bag at each end, like a &s;tuff Cloak-bag. The Coffin was in a Hear&s;e co|ver'd with white Velvet, &s;et round with Garlands and Coronets curiou&s;ly made of Flowers. And thus they carried her to <HI>Me|dina Celi,</HI> the capital City of the Dutchy of that Name.</P>
<P>Commonly they dre&s;s up the dead in the habit of &s;ome <HI>Re|ligious Order,</HI> and carry them all bare-fac'd into the Church where they are to be bury'd. If it is a Woman, they put her on the habit of the <HI>Carmelites.</HI> This Order is in great Venera|tion here; the Prince&s;&s;es of the Blood retire to their Convent. The Queens them&s;elves, when they are Widows, are oblig'd
<PB N="164" REF="85"> to &s;pend the re&s;t of their Life there, unle&s;s the King otherwi&s;e appointed before his Death, as <HI>Philip</HI> IV. did in favour of Queen <HI>Mary Ann</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> his Wife. And in ca&s;e a Queen is Divorced, &s;he mu&s;t go into a <HI>Religious Hou&s;e;</HI> for Divorced or Widow, &s;he has not the Liberty to marry again.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> pre&s;ume &s;o much above other <HI>Kings,</HI> that they will not endure a <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> who has once been their Wife, &s;hould ever be &s;o to another, let her have the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> hath a natural Daughter, a profe&s;s'd <HI>Carmelite</HI> at <HI>Madrid.</HI> She is wonderful hand&s;om, and 'tis &s;aid &s;he had no mind to take the Habit; but it was her fate, as 'tis of divers others of her Quality, who like it no more than &s;he.</P>
<P>They call them the <HI>De&s;calcas Reales,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>The Royal bare-feet.</HI> This reaches even to the King's Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, whether they be unmarried or Widows, when he can love them no longer, they mu&s;t turn <HI>Nunns.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome of the Works of St. <HI>There&s;a,</HI> writ with her own Hand; the Character is Legible, large, and indifferent fair. <HI>Donna Beatrix Carillo,</HI> who is her Neece's Neece, keeps them very choi&s;ely. It was &s;he that &s;hew'd them to me. They con|&s;i&s;t of a Collection of Letters; I do not believe they were ever Printed; there's a great deal of Perfection in them; and throughout, one may di&s;cover a certain air of chearfulne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of Nature, which &s;ufficiently declares the Character of that great Saint.</P>
<P>All the time of <HI>Lent,</HI> and even at other times, one meets with Preachers at every corner of a &s;treet, who&s;e Sermons are ill enough contriv'd, and do as little good; but however in prea|ching as they do, they both &s;atisfie their zeal and their de&s;ire. Their mo&s;t con&s;tant Auditors are the blind Folks, which re&s;em|ble our fingers upon <HI>Pont-Neu&s;.</HI> Every one of them being led by a little Dog which does it very well, they go about &s;inging of <HI>Romances</HI> and <HI>Cacara,</HI> which are certain old Stories or Mo|dern Events, which the People are very glad to know. They have a little Drum, and a Flute, on which they play. They of|ten &s;ing a Song on King <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, it beginning, <HI>When the King left</HI> France, <HI>to his Sorrow he left it,</HI> &amp;c. Now I doubt you know it, dear Cou&s;in, for who does not: This Song is &s;ung in very bad <HI>French,</HI> and by Folks that do not under&s;tand one word of it; All that they under&s;tand is, That the King was taken by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and as this Price was much for their Glory, &s;o they are willing to convey the Memory of it down to Po&s;terity. There's a <HI>Flower-de-Luce</HI> all gilt upon the
<PB N="165" REF="85"> roof of the Chamber where this King was Pri&s;oner; and I mu&s;t not omit telling you, that the Pri&s;on is one of the faire&s;t Buil|dings in <HI>Madrid;</HI> the Windows are as large as tho&s;e of other Hou&s;es. There are indeed Iron Bars, but they are all gilt, and &s;et at a di&s;tance great enough, to make any one think they were not de&s;ign'd to hinder e&s;capes. I &s;tood amaz'd at the &s;eeming neatne&s;s of a Place which in reality is unplea&s;ant e|nough, and I thought that in <HI>Spain,</HI> they had a mind to con|tradict the <HI>French</HI> Proverb, which &s;ays, That, <HI>There's neither any hand&s;ome Pri&s;on, nor ugly Love.</HI> Pardon this Proverb, I do not love them &s;o well to trouble you often with them.</P>
<P>All the Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff one &s;ees here, is extream rich, but not &s;o neatly made as ours in <HI>France,</HI> and they come altogether &s;hort of our skill. It con&s;i&s;ts of Tapi&s;try, Cabinets, Paintings, Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, and Plate. The <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Governours of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> have had mo&s;t admirable Tapi&s;try; the <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> &s;hew mo&s;t ex|cellent Embroideries and Statues; tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies,</HI> Precious Stones, and Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver. So that &s;everal return|ing home from time to time, laden with the Riches of another Kingdom, cannot chu&s;e but to have enrich'd this City with abun|dance of valuable things.</P>
<P>They change their Furniture &s;everal times a year; their Winter-beds are of Velvet trim'd with thick Galoons of Gold; but they are &s;o low, and the Valens &s;o deep, that one is as if they were bury'd in them; and when one is in Bed, the border of the Valens lying almo&s;t upon the Counterpain, one can hard|ly be &s;een. In Summer they have neither Curtains, nor any thing el&s;e about the Bed; this looks very ill. Sometimes they hang colour'd Gauze to keep off the Gnats.</P>
<P>In Winter they have their Appartments very high, &s;ome|times in the fourth Story, according as the cold encrea&s;es, to keep them from it. At pre&s;ent they u&s;e their Summer Lodg|ings, which are low and very commodious. All their Hou&s;es have a great many Rooms on a floor; you go through a dozen or fifteen Parlours or Chambers one after another. Tho&s;e which are the wor&s;t lodg'd have &s;ix or &s;even; the Rooms are general|ly longer than they are broad, the Floors and Seelings are nei|ther painted, nor gilt, they are made of Plai&s;ter quite plain, but &s;o white that they dazle ones Eyes, for every year they are &s;crapt, and whited as the Walls, which look like Marble, they are &s;o well poli&s;ht. The Court to their Summer Appartments is made of certain matter, which after it has had ten Pails of
<PB N="166" REF="86"> Water thrown upon it, yet is dry in half an hour after, and leaves a plea&s;ant coolne&s;s; &s;o that in the Morning they water all, and a little while after, they &s;pread Matts or Carpets made of very fine Ru&s;hes, which cover all the Pavement. The whole Appartments are hung with the &s;ame &s;mall Matt about the depth of an Ell, to hinder the coldne&s;s of the Walls from hur|ting tho&s;e which lean again&s;t them. On the top of the&s;e Matts, there are hung Pictures and Looking-Gla&s;&s;es. The Cu&s;hions which are of Gold and Silver Brocado, are placed up|on the Carpet, and the Tables and Cabinets are very fine, and at little di&s;tances there are &s;et Silver Ca&s;es or Boxes, fill'd with Orange and Je&s;&s;emin-Trees. In their Windows they &s;et things made of Straw, to keep the Sun out, and in the Evenings they walk in their Gardens. There are &s;everal Hou&s;es which have very fine ones, where you &s;ee Grotta's and Fountains in abun|dance, for they have great plenty of Water here, and 'tis very good. In the number of the&s;e fine Hou&s;es they reckon, the Duke <HI>D'O&s;&s;ona</HI>'s, that of the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>'s Lady, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> but I do wrong in particularizing of them, for there are a con&s;iderable number of them.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, it &s;eems to me, that the great care they take, prevents the heats (let them be never &s;o exce&s;&s;ive) from being trouble&s;om to them. But do not fancy, I be&s;eech ye, that on|ly the great Lords have their low Appartments, for indeed every body el&s;e has them according to their Ability; though it be on|ly a little Cellar, they'll live in't very contentedly.</P>
<P>There are but few ordinary People at <HI>Madrid,</HI> one &s;eldom &s;ees any but Per&s;ons of Quality, if &s;even or eight Streets which are full of Trade&s;men, are excepted. You &s;ee no Shops in this City, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e where Sweet-meats, Liquors, Ice, and Pa&s;try are &s;old.</P>
<P>I will not neglect telling you, that a thou&s;and People here, have their <HI>Canopys;</HI> for without reckoning the Princes and the Dukes, the <HI>Titled</HI> (of which there is a va&s;t number) have theirs al&s;o. The&s;e <HI>Titled,</HI> are tho&s;e they call the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> the real <HI>Marqui&s;es,</HI> and the real <HI>Counts.</HI> If there be thirty Chambers on a floor in a Hou&s;e, you &s;hall there &s;ee as many <HI>Ca|nopys.</HI> My Kin&s;woman has twenty in her Hou&s;e: The King has made her Marchione&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tille.</HI> You cannot imagine how gravely I look under a <HI>Canopy,</HI> particularly when they bring me my Chocolate; for three or four Pages cloth'd in black like Lawyers, &s;erve me upon Knee. This is a Cu&s;tom I had much
<PB N="167" REF="86"> ado to bring my &s;elf to, for methinks this re&s;pect ought to be paid to <HI>God</HI> only. But it is &s;o common here, that if a Cob|ler's Prentice &s;hould pre&s;ent an old Shooe to his Ma&s;ter, he mu&s;t do it with knee upon the Ground. This quality of <HI>Titulos</HI> gives them divers Priviledges, of which I have already told you, and particularly that of having a <HI>Canopy.</HI> They u&s;e no Balli&s;ters about their Beds.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved to you before, Dear Cou&s;in, that our Hou&s;es are not near &s;o well furni&s;h'd in <HI>France,</HI> as the Per|&s;ons of Quality here are, but chiefly as to Ve&s;&s;els of Silver, the difference is &s;o very great, that one which had not &s;een it could hardly believe it: They u&s;e no Ve&s;&s;el of Tin or Pewter, but either Silver or Earthen-ware only, is what they make u&s;e of; and you mu&s;t know their Plates here, weigh little le&s;s than our Di&s;hes in <HI>France,</HI> every thing is made &s;o &s;trangely heavy.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alburqerque</HI> dy'd &s;ome time ago. I have been told, that they were &s;ix Weeks in weighing his Ve&s;|&s;els of Gold and Silver, and writing them down; during this time they employ'd two whole hours every day; this was very chargable. Among&s;t other things, there were fourteen hundred dozen of Plates, five hundred great Di&s;hes, and &s;e|ven hundred little ones, and of every thing el&s;e proportio|nably; there were al&s;o forty Silver Ladders to &s;et things on the Cup-bord, which was made to a&s;cend by little Steps, like your Altars in a great Hall. When they told me of &s;uch great Wealth of a particular Man, I thought they je&s;ted with me, and therefore de&s;ir'd the Confirmation of it from <HI>Don Antonio de Toleda,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Alba,</HI> who was in the &s;ame Hou&s;e; he a&s;&s;ur'd me it was very true, and that his Father, who did not e&s;teem him&s;elf rich in Ve&s;&s;els of Silver, had three hundred dozen of Silver Plates, and eight hundred Di&s;hes. The mighty Meals which they make do not require &s;uch great &s;tore, unle&s;s it be at their Marriages, where every thing is magnificent. But that which cau&s;es &s;uch great abundance of Ve&s;&s;els, is, that they are brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> ready made, and pay no Cu&s;tom to the King. The truth is, they are little better &s;hap'd than their pieces of four <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> which they &s;tamp in the Galeon as they come from that Country.</P>
<P>It would grieve a body to &s;ee the ill management of &s;ome great Lords; there are divers which will never go to their E|&s;tates, (for &s;o they call their Lands, their Towns and Ca&s;tles) but pa&s;s all their Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and tru&s;t all to a Steward,
<PB N="168" REF="87"> who makes them believe what he judges mo&s;t for his own In|tere&s;t. They will not &s;o much as vouch&s;afe to enquire whether he &s;peaks true or fal&s;e; this would be too exact, and by con|&s;equence below them. This methinks is one con&s;iderable fault; the &s;trange profu&s;ion of Ve&s;&s;els only for an Egg and a Pigeon, is another.</P>
<P>But it is not only in the&s;e things which they fail, but 'tis al|&s;o in the daily Expences of their Hou&s;es; they know not what it is to lay up &s;tores, or make Provi&s;ion of any thing, but every day they fetch in what they want, and all upon tru&s;t, at the Bakers, Cooks, Butchers, and all other Trades; they are even ignorant what they &s;et down in their Books, and they put down what price they will for every thing they &s;ell, this matter is neither examin'd into, nor contradicted. There are often fifty Hor&s;es in a Stable, whithout either Corn or Straw, and they peri&s;h with Hunger; and when the Ma&s;ter is in Bed, and &s;hould be taken ill in the Night, he would be at a great lo&s;s; for they let nothing remain in his Hou&s;e, neither Wine nor Water, Charcoal nor Wax-candle, and in a word, nothing at all; for though they do not take in Pro|vi&s;ions &s;o near that there is nothing left, yet his Servants have a Cu&s;tom of carrying the overplus away to their own Lodgings, and the next day they furni&s;h them&s;elves with the &s;ame things again.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve no better Rules with the Trade&s;men; a Man or Woman of Quality had rather dye, than to haggle for, or ask the price of a Stuff, or Lace, or any other thing, or to take the remainder of a piece of Gold; they rather choo&s;e to give it the Trade&s;man for his pains of having &s;old them that for ten Pi&s;tols, which was not worth five. If there is a rea&s;onable price made, he that &s;ells to them is &s;o hone&s;t not to take advantage of their ea&s;ine&s;s to give whatever is askt them; and as they have Credit given them for ten years together without ever thinking of paying, &s;o at la&s;t they find them&s;elves under great difficulties with their Debts.</P>
<P>It is very rare they engage in tedious Suits at Law, or let things come to extremity; they bring them&s;elves to account, call their Creditors, and make over to them a certain part of their Lands, which for a limited time they enjoy. Some|times they give up every thing, and re&s;erve only a Pen&s;ion for Life, which cannot be medl'd with by any Creditors who may afterwards &s;ell or lend any thing to them; and to the
<PB N="169" REF="87"> end they be not defrauded of it, they publi&s;h the agreement be|tween the Lord and his Creditors.</P>
<P>All Law-paper is mark'd, and co&s;ts more than the other. There's a certain time when they make a di&s;tribution of Law-Suits; they give the In&s;tructions at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but there are few judg'd there; all the Papers of one &s;ide are put in|to a Bag, and tho&s;e of the other, into another Bag, and the In&s;tructions into a third; and when the time to di&s;tribute the Law-Suits is come, they &s;end them to &s;ome di&s;tant Parlia|ments, &s;o that very often one's Cau&s;e is try'd and judg'd with|out knowing any thing of it: It is writ in a Regi&s;ter whether the Cau&s;e was &s;ent, which is kept very &s;ecret. When Judg|ment is given, it is &s;ent back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and is &s;ignify'd to the Parties. This Method &s;aves a great deal of Trouble and Solli|citations, which in my Opinion ought always to be forbidden. As to bu&s;ine&s;s here, it is exce&s;&s;ive tedious, whether it be at Court or in the City, and ruines one in a little time. The <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Practitioners are great Knaves in their Trade.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal different Councils, all compos'd of Per&s;ons of Quality, and the greate&s;t part are Coun&s;ellors of the Sword. The fir&s;t is the Council of State, the others are call'd the &s;u|pream Council of War, the Royal Council of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> the Al|caides of Court, the Council of the Holy <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> the Council of Orders, the Sacred, Supream and Royal Council of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Royal Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Council of the Chamber of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> the Council of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Council of the <HI>Finances,</HI> the Council of the <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> the Council of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Court for the Duty of Hor&s;e, the Court for his Maje&s;ty's Woods, and the Courts of the Millions.</P>
<P>They under&s;tand &s;o little how to manage things to the be&s;t advantage, that when a Father dyes and leaves ready Money, and &s;ome Children under Age, that they lock the Money up in a Che&s;t, and never put it out to be improv'd. For Example, The Duke <HI>de Frias,</HI> who&s;e Widow is marry'd to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> left three Daughters, and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Crowns in ready Money, they put it into three Che&s;ts, with with the Name of each Daughter. The Elde&s;t was not &s;even years old; &s;he is now marry'd in <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Prince <HI>de Ligne.</HI> The Guardians con&s;tantly kept the Keys of the&s;e Che&s;ts, and never open'd that of the Elde&s;t, but to compt it to her Husband. Ob&s;erve what a lo&s;s there is of Intere&s;t: But they tell you it would be much wor&s;e, if the Principal happen'd to be lo&s;t; that &s;ometimes when one thinks they have put it &s;e|curely
<PB N="570" REF="88"> out, it proves quite otherwi&s;e: That a Bankrupt makes one lo&s;e all; &s;o that it is better to gain nothing, than to hazard the Pupil's E&s;tate.</P>
<P>It is time to come to an end, Dear Cou&s;in; I &s;hall be afraid to tire you with a longer Letter: I be&s;eech you cau&s;e all tho&s;e I &s;end you, to be deliver'd, and pardon the freedom I take; Adieu, I embrace and con&s;tantly love you with all my Heart.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF A Voyage to <HI>SPAIN,</HI> IN <HI>Several Letters.</HI> The La&s;t PART.</HEAD>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>YOU did me a particular Kindne&s;s in letting me know that all my Letters come to your hands, for I was a little concern'd for the Two la&s;t: And &s;ince you &s;till de&s;ire it, (dear Cou&s;in) I &s;hall con|tinue to inform you of every thing that pa&s;&s;es, and of all that I ob&s;erve in this Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal</HI> Palace is built upon a Hill which in&s;en&s;ibly de|&s;cends to the very Banks of the River call'd <HI>Man&s;anarez:</HI> It looks &s;everal ways upon the Country, which is very plea|&s;ant there. One goes to it through the <HI>Callemayor,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Great Street, which indeed is both very long and broad, &s;everal con&s;iderable Hou&s;es add to its Beauty. There's a large open place before the <HI>Palace,</HI> no body of what Qua|lity &s;oever, is allow'd to come with a Coach into the Court,
<PB N="172" REF="89"> but they &s;top under the great Arch of the Porch, except it be when Bonefires are made there, or when there are <HI>Ma&s;|querades,</HI> and then Coaches go in, a very &s;mall number of Halbardeers &s;tand at the Gate, upon my asking, why &s;o great a King had &s;o &s;mall a Guard, why, Madam, &s;ays a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to me, <HI>Are not we all his Guards?</HI> He reigns too ab&s;olutely in the Hearts of his Subjects, either to fear any thing, or di&s;tru&s;t them. The Palace &s;tands at the end of the City towards the South, it is built of very white Stone, Two Pavillions com|pleat the Front, the re&s;t is not regular. Behind it, there are two &s;quare Courts, each con&s;i&s;ting of four &s;ides, the fir&s;t is adorn'd with two great Terra&s;s-walks, which run quite through, they are rai&s;'d upon high Arches, and are beautified with Balli&s;ters and Statues: That which I ob&s;erv'd very &s;ingu|lar, was, that the Womens Statues had <HI>Red</HI> upon their Cheeks and Shoulders, you go through fine Porches which bring you to the Stair-ca&s;e, which is extream large, the Apartments are furni&s;ht with excellent Pictures, admirable Tapi&s;try, mo&s;t rare Statues, &s;tately Hou&s;hold Goods, and in a word, with every thing &s;uitable to a <HI>Royal Palace.</HI> But there are divers of the Rooms dark, I &s;aw &s;ome which had no Window, and receiv'd Light only when the Door open'd, tho&s;e which have Win|dows are but little lighter, becau&s;e of their &s;mallne&s;s, they al|ledge that the Heat is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that they are willing to hinder the Sun from coming in, as much as they can. But there's yet another Rea&s;on, for Gla&s;s is very &s;carce and dear; and as to other Hou&s;es, there are many which have Windows without any Gla&s;s; and when they would de&s;cribe a compleat Hou&s;e, they'll tell you in one word, that <HI>'tis Glaz'd.</HI> This want of Gla&s;s does not appear without, becau&s;e of the Latices. The Palace is addorn d with divers gilt Balconies, which in|deed look very fine. All the <HI>Councils</HI> &s;it there, and when the <HI>King</HI> has a mind to be pre&s;ent, he pa&s;&s;es through certain Gal|leries and little Entries unperceiv'd. There's a great many People per&s;waded, that the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which <HI>Francis</HI> the Fifth caus'd to be built near the Wood of <HI>Bologn,</HI> was af|ter the Model of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Palace; but 'tis a mi&s;|take, and nothing is le&s;s alike. The Gardens are not &s;uitable to the Dignity of the Place, they are neither large enough, nor &s;o well improv'd as they &s;hould be, the Ground as I have ob&s;erv'd, reaches to the very Brink of <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> the whole is inclos'd with Walls; and if the&s;e Gardens have any Beauty, they owe it purely to Nature. They work hard to get the Young <HI>Queens</HI> Apartment ready for her Reception, all her
<PB N="173" REF="89"> Servants are nam'd, and the King expects her with the great|e&s;t Impatience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> is a Royal Hou&s;e near one of the Gates of the City, the Count Duke caus'd at fir&s;t, a little hou&s;e to be built there, and call'd it <HI>Galinera,</HI> it was for keeping his rare Poultry in, which had been pre&s;ented to him, and as he often went to &s;ee them, and the Scituation of the Place was on the de&s;cent of a little Hill, and there was a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, &s;o he was invited to undertake a con&s;iderable Building. Four great Apartments and four great Pavillions make a perfect Square. In the middle there's a Flower-Pot, well furni&s;h'd with Flowers, and a Fountain, who&s;e Statue (which throws the Water when they have a mind) Sprinkles the Flowers and the Cro&s;s-Walks, which goes from one Apartment to another. This Building has the fault of being too low, the Rooms are large, &s;tately and adorn'd with curious Paintings. Every thing &s;hines with Gold and lively Colours, with which the Cielings and Floors are beautified. I took notice in the great Gal|lery, of the Entry of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Mother to the late Queen, &s;he's on Hor&s;eback, with a Ruff and Fardingal, &s;he has a Hat trimm'd with Jewels and a Plume of Feathers; &s;he is fat, fair and plea&s;ing, &s;he has fine Eyes, and her Looks are &s;weet and ingenious. The Room for acting Plays in, is well de&s;ign'd, very large, all well &s;et out, with Carving and Guild|ing, there may be fifteen in a Box without inconvenience to each other, they have all Latice Windows, and the King's is richly guilt, there's neither Galleries nor Amphitheatre, e|very body &s;its upon Benches on the Floor. On the &s;ide of the Terra&s;s is the Statue of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. upon a Hor&s;e of Bra&s;s, this Piece is of great Value, tho&s;e that are curious plea&s;e them|&s;elves in taking a draught of him. The Park is above a good League in compa&s;s, there are in it divers &s;eparate Lodges, very pretty, and which have good Accomodation of room, there's a Canal which is &s;upply'd with Water from Springs at a va&s;t Charge, and another &s;quare Place in which the King has little Gundoloes painted and gilt, thither he goes during the great Heats of the Summer, the Fountains, Trees and Meadows making that Place more cool and plea&s;ant than any other, there's Grottos, Cataracts, Ponds, Shades, and in &s;ome parts even &s;omething of the wild Fields, which &s;hews the &s;im|plicity of the Countrey, and is extream delightful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;a del Campo</HI> is for rural Affairs, it is not great, but its Scituation is fine, being upon the Bank of <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> the the Trees in't are high, and yield a Shade at all times. I &s;peak
<PB N="174" REF="90"> of the Trees of this Country, becau&s;e one finds very few of them, there's Water in divers parts of it, particularly one Pond which is &s;urrounded with great Oaks. The Statue of <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. is in the Garden, this Place is a little neg|lected here, I &s;aw Lions, Bears, Tigers and other wild Bea&s;ts, which live very long in <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e the Climate is little different from that from which they come, many People go there to <HI>think,</HI> and the Ladies u&s;ually choo&s;e this Place to walk in, becau&s;e 'tis le&s;s frequented than others. But to return to <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> this River does not run up to the City, at certain times, it is neither River, nor &s;o much as a Brook, tho at other times it is &s;o big and rapid, that it carries before it all that &s;tands in its way, all the Summer People walk in it, there's &s;o little water in't at this &s;ea&s;on, that one can hardly wet ones foot, and yet in Winter, all on a &s;udden, it over|flows the adjacent Country, this is caus'd by the melting of the great Quantities of Snow which covers the Hills, and &s;o de|&s;cends into the <HI>Man&s;anarez</HI> in violent Torrents of Water, <HI>Philip</HI> the II. caus'd a Bridge to be built over it, which they call'd the <HI>Segovie Bridge,</HI> it is a very lofty one, and every way as fine as the <HI>Pont-neuf,</HI> over the River <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> when Strangers &s;ee it, they fall a laughing, they think it ridiculous to have caus'd &s;uch a Bridge to be built, where there's no Water. Hereupon there was one &s;aid wittily enough, <HI>he would advi&s;e 'em to &s;ell the Bridge, and buy &s;ome Water.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Florid</HI> is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Hou&s;e, and its Gardens are infinitely delightful; there are in great numbers <HI>Italian</HI> Sta|tues by the be&s;t Ma&s;ters: The Water there makes a pretty &s;ort of a murmur, which with the &s;weet &s;mell of the Flowers, (of which they have a Collection of the rare&s;t and be&s;t &s;cent) is very charming. From thence we come to the <HI>Prado Nuevo,</HI> where there are &s;everal &s;pouting Fountains, and Trees there are of an extraordinary height; this is a Walk, which though it be not even Ground, yet is not le&s;s agreeable; its de&s;cent is &s;o ea&s;ie, that one hardly perceives the unevenne&s;s of the Place.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o the <HI>Carzuela,</HI> which affords nothing but Con|trary delights, and &s;ome cool Rooms, where the King comes and re&s;ts him&s;elf after Hunting; but 'tis the Pro&s;pect which yields the Plea&s;ure, and very fine things might be there made.</P>
<P>That I may tell you of &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides the Kings Hou&s;es, you mu&s;t know, dear Cou&s;in, that on <HI>May-day,</HI> they re&s;ort to a Place without the gate of <HI>Toleda.</HI> This is called
<PB N="175" REF="90"> <HI>El Sotillo,</HI> and no body excu&s;e them&s;elves from going thither; to be &s;ure then I went, but it was more to &s;ee then be &s;een, th&ocirc; my <HI>French</HI>-Dre&s;s made me very remarkable, and drew a great many Eyes upon me, The Women of great Quality ne|ver go abroad to take the Air in their whole Life, except it be in the fir&s;t year of their Marriage, I mean into publick Walks and Places; and then too, 'tis under the very no&s;es of their Husbands, the Wife at the lower, and the Husband at the up|per end of the Coach; the Curtains all open, and &s;he finely a|dorn'd: but 'tis a rediculous thing to &s;ee the&s;e two Creatures &s;it like Statues, looking at each other, and without &s;peaking a word in an hours time. There are certain days &s;et apart for walking and taking the Air, all <HI>Madrid</HI> go abroad then; the King is &s;eldom there, but except the King and a few Courtiers, no body el&s;e fail of going. That which makes it very trouble|&s;ome is, their long Traces, which take up a great compa&s;s of Ground, and occa&s;ion the Hor&s;es often to entangle. Several Ladies which are not of the highe&s;t Rank, re&s;ort thither, but with their Curtains clo&s;e drawn; they only look through little Gla&s;&s;es which are fa&s;tned into the &s;ides of the Coach: but at Night the Ladies of great Quality come <HI>Incognito;</HI> and when 'tis dark they plea&s;e them&s;elves &s;o far as to walk a foot: They wear white Mantles upon their Heads; the&s;e are a kind of a Hood made of Woolen &s;tuff, which covers them all over; they Embroider them with black Silk: they are only the or|dinary Women, and &s;uch as go upon &s;ome Intreague, which wear them; yet &s;ometimes, as I have &s;aid, certain <HI>Court-La|dies</HI> will go in this Dre&s;s. The <HI>Cavallero's</HI> al&s;o alight and walk, and &s;ay &s;ome odd thing or other to them, but they meet with their match.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Berka,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Enyoy, told me, that t'other Night as he was at Supper, and his Windows (becau&s;e of the cold) being &s;hut, &s;omebody knock'd at the Lattice of his Hall, he &s;ent to &s;ee who it was; they found three Wo|men in white Mantles, who de&s;ired to have the Windows o|pen'd that they might &s;ee him. He &s;ent them word, that they would be more conveniently in the Hall: They came in all concealed, and placed them&s;elves in a corner, and &s;o &s;tood all the while he was at Table. He intreated them (but in vain) to &s;it down and eat &s;ome Sweet-meats, but they would neither do one nor t'other; but after they had &s;aid a great ma|ny merry things to him, in which they abundantly &s;hewed a &s;trange quickne&s;s of Wit, they went away. He di&s;covered that the&s;e were the Dutche&s;&s;es <HI>de Medina Celi, d' O&s;&s;ona</HI> and
<PB N="176" REF="91"> <HI>Ducada,</HI> having &s;een them at their own Hou&s;es; for <HI>Amba&s;|adors</HI> have the priviledge &s;ometimes to go to the great La|dies, and to give them a vi&s;it of <HI>Audience;</HI> but he was willing to have yet a greater certainty, and therefore cau&s;ed them to be follow'd: and they were &s;een to go into one of their Hou&s;es by a fal&s;e Door, at which &s;ome of their Women waited for them. The&s;e little Di&s;gui&s;es are not always attended with o|ver-much Innocence.</P>
<P>As to the Men, when Night comes, they walk a foot in the <HI>Prado;</HI> they make up to the Coaches in which they &s;ee Wo|men, and leaning upon the Bouts, they either throw Flowers, or &s;prinkle &s;weet Water upon them; and when they are per|mitted, they go into the Coach to them.</P>
<P>But as to the meeting on <HI>May-day,</HI> It is certainly a great plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Citizens and the People how they &s;it; &s;ome upon the young Corn, &s;ome upon the &s;ides of the <HI>Man&s;ana|rez,</HI> others playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and others either with their Wives, Children, Friends or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, basking them&s;elves in the Sun; &s;ome are eating of a Sallad with Leeks and Oni|ons, and others, hard Eggs; and others Gamon of Bacon, and even <HI>Galinas de Loche,</HI> which are Sea-Hens, and very ex|cellent. They all drink Water like Ducks, and play either up|on the Guittar or Harp. The <HI>King</HI> came there with <HI>Don John,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Con&s;table <HI>de Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Pa&s;tratie;</HI> I only &s;aw his Coach of green Oil-cloth, drawn by &s;ix py'd Hor&s;es, the fine&s;t in the World; and all co|vered over with Gold-&s;pangles, and knots of Ro&s;e-coloured Ribbon: The Curtains of the Coach were of green Damask, with a fine gold Fringe, but &s;o clo&s;e drawn, that one could per|ceive nothing but through the little Gla&s;&s;es on the &s;ides of the Coach. It is the Cu&s;tom, when the <HI>King</HI> pa&s;&s;es by, to &s;tand &s;till, and in re&s;pect, to draw the Curtains; but we, according to the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hion, let ours be open, and were &s;atisfied in making a very low Bow. The <HI>King</HI> took notice of a Spaniel-bitch I had in my Arms, and which the Marchione&s;s <HI>d' Alvi,</HI> who is a very pretty Lady, de&s;ired me to carry to the Con|&s;table of <HI>Colonna</HI>'s Lady; and as I lov'd it mightily, &s;he &s;ent it to me very often. The <HI>King</HI> &s;ent the Count <HI>de los Arcos,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guards, to ask me for it; he came up to the Coach &s;ide on Hor&s;e-back. I immediately gave it to him, and the Creature had the Honour to be made much of by his Maje&s;ty, was mightily plea&s;ed with the little Bells about her Neck; and the Buckles upon her Ears. He had a Bitch which he lov'd extreamly, and he &s;ent to ask me if I would be wil|ling
<PB N="177" REF="91"> that he &s;hould keep mine for <HI>Daraza,</HI> which was the Name of his.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine, Dear Cou&s;in, what an&s;wer I made. He returned me the Spaniel, but without either her Collar or Buckles, and he order'd the Count <HI>de Los Arcos</HI> to give me a gold Box full of Pa&s;tills, which he had about him, and de&s;ired me to keep it. It is but of a &s;mall value, but coming from &s;uch a hand, I mightily e&s;teem it.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Don John,</HI> who is my Kin&s;womans Friend, which ob|tain'd this mark of the <HI>King</HI>'s bounty to me; for he knew of my being in <HI>Madrid,</HI> though I had not had the Honour yet to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Two days afterwards, as I was all alone in my apartment, bu&s;ie in painting a &s;mall piece, I &s;aw come in, a Man whom I knew not; but one, who by the air of his Face, I could ea&s;ily judge to be of Quality: He told me, that not having met with my Kin&s;woman, he was re&s;olved to tarry till &s;he came, for he had Letters to give her. After &s;ome little Di&s;cour&s;e, he gave occa&s;ion to talk of <HI>Don John,</HI> and told me that he doubt|ed not, that I frequently &s;aw him. I reply'd, that indeed, &s;ince my arrival, this <HI>Prince</HI> came often to vi&s;it my Kin&s;wo|man, but he never ask'd for me. The rea&s;on of that perhaps, adds he, was, becau&s;e you were &s;ick that day. I was not &s;ick, reply'd I, and I &s;hould have been very glad both to have &s;een and heard him, for I have been told both good and ill of him, and I have a mind to know whether they do him right or wrong. I have &s;ignify'd my de&s;ire to my Kin&s;woman, but &s;he told me, there was no way to gratifie me, for he was &s;o devout, that he would &s;peak to no Woman. It is po&s;&s;ible, &s;ays he, in &s;miling, that his Devotion &s;hould &s;o much di&s;turb his Mind? for my part, I am confident he ask'd for you, and was a&s;&s;ur'd that you were ill of a Feaver; Of a Feaver! cry'd I, that's very &s;trange! I be&s;eech ye, how do you know it? But ju&s;t then, my Kin&s;woman came in, &s;he was extreamly a|mazed to find <HI>Don John</HI> with me, and &s;o was I, for I little thought it was he. He told her &s;everal times, that he knew not how to pardon her for the Idea &s;he had given me of him, that he was no Bigot, and that he was per&s;uaded, true Devo|tion did not make a Man rude and inhumane,</P>
<P>I think him very hand&s;ome, of a noble Carriage, very well bread, and extream witty, and of a mighty quickne&s;s of Mind. As my Kin&s;woman has a great &s;hare of Wit, &s;o &s;he clear'd her &s;elf well enough from what he taxt her with. But when he was gone, &s;he was ready to eat me for anger, becau&s;e I
<PB N="178" REF="92"> deny'd having had a Feaver. I de&s;ir'd her to excu&s;e me, be|cau&s;e me, becau&s;e I was ignorant what &s;he had &s;aid to him, and that I could not <HI>divine:</HI> She an&s;wer'd me, that at Court, one mu&s;t either be able to <HI>divine,</HI> or el&s;e they would act a very &s;illy part.</P>
<P>She ask'd the Prince, if it was true, that the <HI>Queen</HI>-Mother had writ to the <HI>King,</HI> and beg'd that &s;he might &s;ee him, and that he had refus'd her. He agreed it was, and al&s;o, that that was the only rea&s;on which hindred his Maje&s;ty from going to <HI>Aranjus,</HI> le&s;t &s;he &s;hould come to him there, contrary to the Prohibition for her not &s;tiring out of <HI>Toleda.</HI> What, my <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, will not the <HI>King</HI> &s;ee the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother? Say ra|ther, reply's he, that 'tis <HI>State-Policy</HI> which forbids <HI>Sovereigns to follow their Inclinations when they do not &s;uit with the publick good.</HI> We have a con&s;tant Maxim in the <HI>Council of State,</HI> al|ways to con&s;ult the Spirit of <HI>Charles</HI> V. in all difficult Matters; we enquire what he would have done upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and that we endeavour to practice in our turn. For my part, I am of Opinion with a great many others, that he ought not to &s;ee his Mother, &s;ince it was fit for him to bani&s;h her; and the <HI>King</HI> him&s;elf is &s;o fully per&s;waded of this, that he an&s;wered her, it could not be. But it was not difficult for me to &s;ee, that <HI>Don John</HI> fitted the Genius of <HI>Charles</HI> V. to his own.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> is gone to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> where I had the Honour to &s;ee him fir&s;t, at a Play, for he open'd the Lattice of his Box to look at us in ours, becau&s;e we were dre&s;t after the <HI>French</HI> way. The <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady was dre&s;t after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and &s;o hand&s;ome, that he told the Prince of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> he was mightily taken with us, only it was pitty that our Heads were not trim'd, and our Bodies clad after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> mode; that the more he look'd at the <HI>French</HI> Ladies Cloths, the more they di&s;pleas'd him, that the Mens did not &s;o much offend him. The <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinus</HI> was acted before him, but I gave little Attention to it, looking &s;o earne&s;tly at the <HI>King,</HI> that I might be able to de&s;cribe him to you. I mu&s;t tell you then, that his Complexion is delicate and fair, he has a broad Fore-head, his Eyes are fine and have a great deal of &s;weetne&s;s in them; his Face is very long and narrow, his Lips like tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> are very thick, and his Mouth is wide, his No&s;e is very much hawk't, his Chin is &s;harp and turns up, he has a great Head of Hair, and fair, lank and put behind his Ears, his Stature is pretty high, &s;traight and &s;lender, his Legs are &s;mall, and almo&s;t all of a
<PB N="179" REF="92"> thickne&s;s: He is naturally very kind and good, he is inclin'd to Clemency and of the <HI>great variety of Council he has given him, he takes that which is mo&s;t for the advantage of his People, for he loves them extreamly.</HI> He is not of a vindicative Spirit, he is &s;ober, liberal and pious; his Inclinations are Virtuous, he is of an even temper, and of ea&s;ie acce&s;s: He hath not had all that Education which is requi&s;ite to form the Mind, but yet he does not want any neither. I will now note &s;ome of his merry Humours which have been told me, and though they are of no great importance, yet it may &s;till be plea&s;ant to know them.</P>
<P>It is not long &s;ince the Lady <HI>Conne&s;table de Collonna,</HI> who is in a <HI>Religious Hou&s;e</HI> at St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> got out of the <HI>Abbey,</HI> from whence &s;he had made &s;everal E&s;capes; the <HI>Nuns</HI> tyr'd with her proceeding, re&s;olv'd to admit her no more; and indeed the la&s;t time &s;he endeavour'd to get in, they plainly told her, that &s;he might either betake her &s;elf to the World, or cho&s;e &s;ome other place than their Hou&s;e for a Retirement. She was extreamly offended at this refu&s;al, which by no means &s;uited with a Per&s;on of her Quality and Merit. She got &s;ome of her Friends to apply them&s;elves to the <HI>King,</HI> and he &s;ent Orders to the <HI>Abbe&s;s</HI> to receive her in again. The <HI>Abbe&s;s</HI> and all the <HI>Nuns</HI> were ob&s;tinate in their refu&s;al, &s;aying that they would them&s;elves repre&s;ent their Rea&s;ons to his Maje&s;ty, and in their Per&s;ons go to him. When this An&s;wer of the <HI>Nuns</HI> was re|lated to the <HI>King,</HI> he bur&s;t out a laughing, and &s;aid, It will be pretty &s;port to &s;ee this <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> who will come along &s;inging, <HI>Libera nos Domine de la Conde&s;tabile.</HI> But yet they did not go, and cho&s;e rather to obey, which is always &s;afe&s;t.</P>
<P>Some days ago it rain'd and thunder'd mo&s;t terribly; the <HI>King,</HI> who &s;ometimes plea&s;es him&s;elf in playing little Tricks with his <HI>Courtiers,</HI> commanded the Marquis <HI>d' A&s;torgas</HI> to wait for him upon the Terras walk in the Palace. The good old man &s;aid to him in &s;miling, <HI>Sir, will it be long before you come?</HI> Why do you ask, &s;aid the <HI>King?</HI> that your Maje&s;ty, reply'd he, may &s;end a Coffin to put me in, for there's no likelyhood that I &s;hould be able to contend with &s;uch Weather as this. Go, go <HI>Marque&s;s,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>King,</HI> I'll come to you. The <HI>Mar|que&s;s</HI> went out, and without any Scruple, &s;tept into his Coach and went directly home. Two hours afterwards, the <HI>King</HI> &s;aid, <HI>for certain the good old Man is wet to the Skin, let him be call'd in,</HI> I <HI>have a mind to &s;ee him in &s;uch a Condition.</HI> But they told the <HI>King</HI> that he did not expo&s;e him&s;elf at all,
<PB N="180" REF="93"> upon which he &s;aid, that he was not only old, but very wi&s;e.</P>
<P>There was taken a little while &s;ince near the Palace di&s;guis'd in man's Clothes, one of the hand&s;ome&s;t <HI>Mi&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;he had &s;et upon her Gallant, of whom &s;he believ'd &s;he had cau&s;e to complain, he knowing her by her voice and the manner of handling her Sword, would not make u&s;e of his to defend him|&s;elf, &s;o far from it, that he opened his Wa&s;t-coat, and gave her free leave to thru&s;t at him, thinking perhaps, that &s;he ei|ther was not angry, or had not Courage enough to do it; but he deceiv'd him&s;elf, for with all her &s;trength &s;he made a Pa&s;s at him, which made him drop down, &s;he no &s;ooner perceiv'd his Blood, but &s;he threw her &s;elf upon the ground, and cri'd out mo&s;t dreadfully, tore her Skin off her Face, and pull'd her Hair off her Head: the People which were got about her very well perceiv'd by her Looks, and her long Hair, that &s;he was a Woman, the Officers of Ju&s;tice &s;eiz'd her, and &s;ome <HI>Lords</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by at that time, &s;eeing her, related to the <HI>King</HI> what had happen'd: He had a mind to &s;peak with her, &s;he was brought before him; Art thou &s;he, &s;aid he, to her, that has wounded a Man near the Palace, Yes, <HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, I was re&s;olv'd to be revenged of an ungrateful Man; he promis'd I &s;hould have his Heart, and yet I am a&s;&s;ur'd he gave it &s;ince to another. But why art thou &s;o afflicted, repli'd he, &s;ince thou ha&s;t got thy Revenge? Ah <HI>Sir,</HI> continued &s;he, in &s;eeking my Revenge, I have puni&s;ht my &s;elf, I am now upon the brink of De&s;pair, I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to command them to put me to death, for I have de&s;erv d the &s;evere&s;t Torment. The <HI>King</HI> took pity of her, and turning to tho&s;e about him, Well, really, &s;aid he, I can hardly believe that there's in the World &s;o mi|&s;erable a State, as to love and not be belov'd. Go, &s;aid he, thou ha&s;t more Love than Rea&s;on, But endeavour to be wi&s;er for the future, and do not abu&s;e that Liberty I re&s;tore to thee. And thus &s;he withdrew without being carri'd to the Place where they keep mi&s;erable Wretches that have led ill Lives.</P>
<P>All this that I have told you of the <HI>King</HI> has carri'd me from the <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it was, with &s;o much wandring of Mind, that when I &s;aw it again, it appear'd quite new to me, there was never &s;een more &s;orry Machines, they made the <HI>Gods</HI> come down on Hor&s;eback upon a Beam which reacht from one end of the Theater to the other; the Sun &s;hin'd by the help of a dou&s;en of oyl'd Paper Lanthorns, in each of which there was a Lamp: when <HI>Alcinous</HI> practis'd her Enchantments, and invok'd the <HI>Demons,</HI> they came conveni|ently
<PB N="181" REF="93"> out of <HI>Hell</HI> by Ladders: <HI>Le Gratio&s;a,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Jack-pudding</HI> &s;aid a thou&s;and Impertinences, the Singers had in different good voices, only they &s;ang too much in the Throat. Heretofore there was a Liberty for &s;everal &s;orts of People to come into the great Room, but this Cu&s;tom is chang'd, and now there's only &s;uffer'd to come in, the Great <HI>Lords,</HI> and at the mo&s;t, the <HI>Tutulados</HI> and the <HI>Knights</HI> of the Three <HI>Military</HI> Orders. This Room is certainly a very fair one, it is all paint|ed and gilt; the Boxes, as I have already told you, are al|ways Barr'd with Lattices like tho&s;e we have at the <HI>Opera;</HI> but they reach from top to bottom, and look as if they were Chambers, that &s;ide where the <HI>King</HI> &s;its is magnificent. As for the re&s;t, the fine&s;t Comedy in the World (I mean tho&s;e that are acted in the City) very often receives its Fate from the weak Fancy of &s;ome ignorant Wretch or other. But there is one particularly, and a Shoomaker, which decides the matter, and who hath gain'd &s;uch an ab&s;olute Authority &s;o to do, that when the <HI>Poets</HI> have made their Plays, they go to him and as 'twere, &s;ue for his Approbation, they read to him their Plays, the Shoomaker with grave Looks thereupon, utters abundance of Non&s;ence, which neverthele&s;s the poor <HI>Poet</HI> is forced to put up, after all, if he happens to be at the fir&s;t Acting of it, every body has their Eye upon the Behaviour and Actions of this pitiful Fellow, the Young People of what Quality &s;oever imi|tate him. If he Yawns, they yawn, if he laughs &s;o do they. In a word, &s;ometimes he grows angry or weary, and then takes a little whi&s;tle and falls a whi&s;tling, at the &s;ame time you &s;hall hear a hundred whi&s;tles, which makes &s;o &s;hril a noi&s;e that 'tis enough to confound the heads of the Spectators. By this time our poor <HI>Poet</HI> is quite ruin'd, All his Study and Pains having been at the Mercy of a Block-head, according as he was in a good or bad humour.</P>
<P>In this Play-hou&s;e, there is a certain part of it, which is call'd <HI>La Ca&s;uela,</HI> it is like the Amphitheater, all the Women that are not over-vertuous &s;it there, and thither the great Lords go to talk with them, &s;ometimes they make &s;uch a noi&s;e that they would outdo the Thunder, and they &s;ay things &s;o ve|ry plea&s;ant, that they would make one die with laughing: for their Wit is free from all re&s;traint of Decency. Be&s;ides, they are inform'd of all things that happen in the Town; and if they had a merry Je&s;t to break upon their <HI>Maje&s;ties,</HI> they had rather be half hang'd then lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that the Women <HI>Players</HI> are ador'd in this Court, there's hardly any that is not the Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;ome great
<PB N="182" REF="94"> Per&s;on, and for whom &s;everal Duels have been fought, and a great many People kill'd. I do not know how charming their Di&s;cour&s;e may be, but I am &s;ure their Per&s;ons are the uglie&s;t in the World, they are extravagantly expen&s;ive, and &s;ooner mu&s;t a whole Family peri&s;h with Hunger and Thir&s;t, than one of tho&s;e beggerly <HI>Players</HI> &s;hould want the lea&s;t Superfluity.</P>
<P>We are now in a Sea&s;on that's trouble&s;ome enough, for 'tis the Cu&s;tom here to put their Mules to Gra&s;s, and every body almo&s;t walks a foot. At this time you can &s;ee nothing but Gra&s;s brought from all parts, and the greate&s;t <HI>Lord</HI> hardly keeps two Mules to draw him, for this rea&s;on they often go on Hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Hor&s;es which have been at the <HI>Bull-baitings</HI> and are good for the&s;e &s;ort of Sports, are dear, and much in reque&s;t. The King had a mind to divert him&s;elf, and ordered a <HI>Bull-Fea&s;t</HI> to be on the Twenty &s;econd of this Month, I was very glad of it, for though I had heard much talk of them, I never &s;aw any yet; and the young Count <HI>De Coni&s;mark,</HI> who is a <HI>Swede,</HI> would <HI>Tauri&s;e,</HI> or Bait the Bull for a young Lady of my Acquaintance, &s;o that I was the more eager to go to the <HI>Pla|ca-Mayor,</HI> where my Kin&s;woman, as &s;he was a <HI>Tutulada</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> had her Balcony &s;et up with a <HI>Canopy,</HI> a Carpet and Cu&s;hion of State. To give you a particular Account of all that pa&s;&s;es at the&s;e <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that after the <HI>King</HI> has appointed one of them, there are &s;ome Cows, which they call <HI>Mandarines,</HI> led into the Forre&s;ts and Mountains of <HI>Andalou&s;ia.</HI> It is known that the mo&s;t furious Bulls are in the&s;e Places, and as they are train'd up for this purpo&s;e, &s;o they run into the Wood; the Bulls &s;py them out, and eagerly court them, tho&s;e fly and the&s;e pur&s;ue them, and &s;o are decoy'd into certain Palli&s;adoes, &s;et on purpo&s;e along the way, which is &s;ometimes Thirty or Forty Leagues in Length, &s;everal Men are armed with Half|pikes and well mounted, hunt the&s;e Bulls and hinder them from coming back, but it is not &s;eldom that they are forc'd to fight them within the&s;e Pales, and frequently they are kill'd or wounded.</P>
<P>There are People placed all along the Road, which bring ad|vice when the <HI>Bulls</HI> will arrive at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and there al&s;o they &s;et Palli&s;adoes in the Street to prevent any mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarines,</HI> who are real traitors, go con&s;tantly before, and the poor Bulls quietly follow after, into the very place de|&s;ign'd for baiting them, where there are great Stables built on purpo&s;e with Shutters contriv'd to keep them in, there are &s;ometimes 30, 40, or 50, Together, this Stable has two Doors,
<PB N="183" REF="94"> the <HI>Mandarines</HI> go in at one, and e&s;cape at the other; and when the Bulls think to follow them &s;till they are hindred by Trap, in which they are caught.</P>
<P>After they have re&s;ted a few hours, they are one after ano|ther let out of the Stable into the great <HI>Place,</HI> where there are a great many young, lu&s;ty, &s;trong Pea&s;ants, &s;ome of which take the Bull by the horns, and others by the tail, and becau&s;e they mark him upon the Buttock with a hot iron, and &s;lit his ears, they call them <HI>Heradores.</HI> This is not &s;o ea&s;ily done, for there are frequently divers Per&s;ons kill'd, and this is the be|ginning of the <HI>Shew,</HI> which always mightily delights the Peo|ple, whether it be upon the Account that Blood is &s;hed, or el&s;e, that they love to &s;ee &s;omething extraordinary, and at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;urprizing, and which afterwards furni&s;hes with matter for long Reflections; but though unlucky Accidents do happen at the&s;e Fea&s;ts, yet it does not appear that they take any Warning from them, for they are &s;till forward to expo&s;e them&s;elves at at every Baiting that's made.</P>
<P>The Bulls are fed, and the be&s;t of them are pickt out for the Baiting; they can even di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e that are either Sons or Brothers of tho&s;e Bulls which made a great &s;laughter in for|mer <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> they tie to their horns a long Ribbon, and by the colour of that every body knows them again, and recites the Hi&s;tory of their Ance&s;tors; that the Grand&s;ire or great Grand|&s;ire of the&s;e Bulls bravely kill'd &s;uch and &s;uch a one, and they expect no le&s;s from tho&s;e that then appear.</P>
<P>When they have &s;ufficiently re&s;ted, the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> is co|vered with Sand, and round it are placed Bars as high as a Man, upon which are painted the Arms of the <HI>King</HI> and his King|doms. I fancy this <HI>Place</HI> to be larger than the <HI>Place Royal</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> it is longer than it is broad, and about it are Hou&s;es built upon Pillars and Arches, like Towers, five Stories high, and to each a row of Balconies, into which there are great Gla&s;s-doors. The <HI>King</HI>'s &s;tands more forward than the re&s;t, is more &s;pacious, and all gilt. It is in the middle of one of the &s;ides, with a Canopy over it; over again&s;t it are the <HI>Amba&s;|&s;adours</HI> Balconies, who have place when the <HI>King</HI> goes to Chap|pel, that is the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adours, that of <HI>France,</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and that of <HI>Savoy;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>England, Holland, Swedland, Denmark</HI> and other <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Princes, have none there. The Councils of <HI>Ca&s;tille, Arragon,</HI> the <HI>Inqui&s;iton, Italy, Flanders,</HI> the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Orders, War,</HI> the <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> and of the <HI>Finances,</HI> are on the right hand of the <HI>King:</HI> they are di&s;tingui&s;ht by their Arms upon their Crim&s;on Velvet
<PB N="184" REF="95"> Carpets which are all embroider'd with Gold. After the&s;e, are placed the city Companies, the Judges, the <HI>Grandees</HI> and <HI>Titu|lodos,</HI> according to their &s;everall Degrees, and at the <HI>King's</HI> Charge, or el&s;e at the City's, who hire the&s;e Balconies of pri|vate Per&s;ons that dwell there.</P>
<P>For all tho&s;e I have now nam'd the <HI>King</HI> makes a Collation; and it is given in very neat Baskets, to the Women as well as the Men, it con&s;i&s;ts of Fruits dri'd, Sweet-meats, and Water cool'd with Ice, of Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Pa&s;tiles, Silk-&s;tockings, and Garters, in&s;omuch that the&s;e Fea&s;ts always co&s;t above a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, and this Expence is defray'd out of the Fines and Forfeitures adjudg'd to the <HI>King,</HI> or to the City, this is a Fund which mu&s;t not be medl'd with, tho t'were to &s;ave the Kingdom from the greate&s;t Danger, the doing of it might cau&s;e a Sedition. So bewitcht are the People with this kind of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From the Level of the Pavement to the fir&s;t Balcony, there are Scaffolds made for the re&s;t of the People, they give from Fifteen to twenty Pi&s;tols for a Balcony; and there is not any but what are lett, and adorn'd with rich Carpets, and fine Ca|nopies. The People are not &s;eated under the <HI>King's</HI> Balcony, that Place is fill'd with his Guards, there's only Three Gates open into it, through which the Per&s;ons of Quality pa&s;s in their riche&s;t Coaches, and particularly the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors;</HI> and they make &s;everal turns round it, a little before the <HI>King</HI> comes. The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> &s;alute the Ladies who &s;tand in the Balconies, without being cover'd with their Mantles or Vails, they are deck'd out with all their Jewels, and whatever they have that is fine&s;t. One can &s;ee nothing but extream rich Stuffs, with Tapi&s;try, Cu&s;hions and Carpets, all of rais'd work in Gold. I never &s;aw any thing more glorious, the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony is hung round with Green and Gold Curtains, which he draws when he will not be &s;een.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> came about four a clock, and immediately all the Coaches went out of the Place. Generally the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> is the mo&s;t taken notice of, becau&s;e he and all his Train are dre&s;s'd after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and he is the only <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dor</HI> that has this Priviledge here, for the others are in the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s. There's five or &s;ix Coaches go before the <HI>King's,</HI> in which are the Officers, the Gentlemen and Pages of his Cham|ber. The Coach of Honour, in which there goes no body, marches immediatly before his Maje&s;ty's own, who&s;e Coachman and Po&s;tilion are always barehead, a Footman carrying their Hats; the Coach is &s;urrounded with Foot-Guards. Tho&s;e which
<PB N="185" REF="95"> they call the Life-Guard have Parti&s;ans, and march very near the Coach, and next the Boots go a great many of the <HI>King's</HI> Pages, cloath'd in Black, and without Swords, which is the on|ly mark to know them from other Pages. As the Ladies that are de&s;ign'd to be about the young <HI>Queen,</HI> are already nam'd, &s;o they all came under the Conduct of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> in the <HI>King's</HI> Coaches, they march by the Mens Boutes of the highe&s;t Quality, &s;ome on Foot that they might be nearer, others mounted on the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in the World, train'd up for that purpo&s;e, and which they call <HI>Hor&s;es of Motion.</HI> That they may perform this piece of Gallantry, they mu&s;t have leave from their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, otherwi&s;e 'tis a great Blemi&s;h to their Reputation, and even engages the Ladies Kindred in Trouble, for they take their Honour to be concern'd in this Liberty: But when &s;he approves of it, they may practi&s;e all the plea&s;ant Humours, for which the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> mini&s;ter occa&s;ion. But though they need fear nothing from the Ladies they &s;erve, nor their Relations, yet they are not freed from all unea&s;ine&s;s, for the <HI>Duegno</HI>'s or Women of Honour, of which there's too great a Provi&s;ion in each Coach, and the <HI>Guardadamas</HI> which go on Hor&s;eback, are trouble&s;ome Ob&s;ervers, hardly can one begin to di&s;cour&s;e, but the&s;e old Haggs will draw the Curtain, and the <HI>Guardadamas</HI> will tell you, that that Love which is fulle&s;t of Re&s;pect is the mo&s;t di&s;creet, &s;o that very often one mu&s;t be content to let the Eyes &s;peak, and to &s;igh &s;o loud, that one may be heard at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>All things being thus di&s;pos'd, the Captains of the Guards and the other Officers mounted upon very fine Hor&s;es, enter the Place, at the head of the <HI>Spani&s;h, German,</HI> and <HI>Burgundian</HI> Guards, they are cloath'd in Yellow Velvet or Sattin, which is the Livery of the <HI>King,</HI> trim'd with tufted crim&s;on Galoon mixt with Gold and Silver. The Yeomen of the Guard, which I call the Life-Guard, wear only a &s;hort Cloak of the &s;ame Live|ry, over black Cloaths. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wear Breeches tuckt up after the old way. The <HI>Germans,</HI> which are called <HI>Tude&s;ques,</HI> wear them like the <HI>Switzers,</HI> they &s;tand in Ranks near the <HI>King's</HI> Balcony, while the two Captains and the two Lieute|nants, who carry each of them a Staff of command in their Hands, and are follow'd by a great many in Liveries, march all four in a Rank, at the head of the Guards, &s;everal times round the Place, to give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, and to &s;alute the La|dies of their Acquaintance; their Hor&s;es curvet and bound con|tinually, they are covered with knots of Ribbons, and embroi|dered Hou&s;ings; they are called <HI>Pi&s;&s;adoyes</HI> for Di&s;tinction. Up|on
<PB N="186" REF="96"> this day every one of the&s;e <HI>Lords</HI> affect to wear that colour which their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es love mo&s;t.</P>
<P>When the People are come without the Bars, and are &s;eated upon their Scaffolds, the <HI>Place</HI> is water'd with forty or fifty Tuns of Water which is brought thither in little Carts. Then the Captains of the Guards come back, and take their Po&s;ts un|der the <HI>King's</HI> Balcony, where all the Guards are likewi&s;e pla|ced, and make a &s;ort of a Fence, &s;tanding very clo&s;e together; and although the Bulls are &s;ometimes ready to kill them, yet they mu&s;t not go back nor &s;tir from their place; they only pre&s;ent to them the Point of their Halberds, and &s;o with a great deal of hazard defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you that this &s;trange number of People, (for every place is full, even the tops of the Hou&s;es as well as the re&s;t) the Balconies &s;o richly &s;et out, and &s;o many beautiful Women in them, this great Court, the Guards, and in a word, the whole place makes one of the fine&s;t &s;hews that ever I &s;aw.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Guards are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the quarter where the <HI>King</HI> is, &s;ix <HI>Alguazils,</HI> or City Door-keepers, enter the place, each holding a white Rod: Their Hor&s;es are excellent, har|na&s;s'd after the <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> fa&s;hion, and cover'd with little Bells. Their Habit is black, they wear Plumes of Feathers, and put the be&s;t Looks on they can, in &s;o much danger as they are in; for they are not allow'd to &s;tir out of the <HI>Li&s;t:</HI> and 'tis their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to fetch the <HI>Knights</HI> that are to fight.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you, before I proceed any further in this &s;hort De&s;cription, that there are certain Laws e&s;tabli&s;h'd for this &s;ort of <HI>Baiting,</HI> which are call'd <HI>Duelo,</HI> that is, <HI>Duel,</HI> becau&s;e one Knights a&s;&s;ault the <HI>Bull,</HI> and fights him in &s;ingle Combat. The&s;e are &s;ome of the things which are ob&s;erved: One mu&s;t be a Gentleman born, and known for &s;uch, that he may fight on Hor&s;eback. It is not allow'd to draw the Sword upon the Bull, unle&s;s he has in&s;ulted over you; they call it in&s;ulting when the Bull breaks or forces the Garrochion or Lance out of the Hand, or if he make your Hat fall off, or your Cloak, or has wounded you or your Hor&s;e, or any of your Company. In this ca&s;e, the <HI>Knight</HI> is oblig'd to pu&s;h his Hor&s;e directly upon the Bull; for this is an <HI>Empenno,</HI> that is to &s;ay, an affront that engages one to be reveng'd, or to dye; and he mu&s;t give him <HI>&V;na Cachilada,</HI> or a back &s;troke upon his Head or Neck. But if the Hor&s;e on which the <HI>Cavallero</HI> rides, refu&s;es to go up to the Bull, then immediately he alights, and couragiou&s;ly marches up a foot to this fierce Animal. The Sword is very &s;hort, and about three fingers broad. The other <HI>Knights</HI> which are there
<PB N="187" REF="96"> to fight, are al&s;o oblig'd to alight off their Hor&s;es and accom|pany him, that is under the <HI>Empenno;</HI> but they do not &s;econd him, &s;o as to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the lea&s;t again&s;t his Enemy. If they all march up in this manner towards the Bull, and he flies to the other end of the <HI>Place</HI> in&s;tead of tarrying for them, or meeting them, after they have pur&s;u'd him &s;ome time, they have &s;atisfied the Laws of <HI>Duelling.</HI></P>
<P>If there be in the Town any Hor&s;es that have been at a <HI>Bai|ting,</HI> and are dextrous at it, though they do not know the Ow|ners, yet they'll borrow them; nay, though they do not de&s;ire to &s;ell them, nor the others in a condition to buy them, yet they never refu&s;e them. If by mi&s;chance the Hor&s;e is killed, and they offer to pay for him, it is not accepted; becau&s;e, to receive Money upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion would not be agreeable to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Genero&s;ity. Neverthele&s;s, it would vex a Man to have a Hor&s;e that he had taken pains to breed up, without any more ado taken from him by the fir&s;t Stranger, and through his means kill'd. This &s;ort of Combat is reckon'd &s;o dangerous, that <HI>Indulgencies</HI> are expos'd in &s;everal Churches for tho&s;e days, becau&s;e of the great <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre</HI> that is then made. Several <HI>Popes</HI> would have quite aboli&s;h'd &s;uch barbarous &s;ights, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> beg'd the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly to let them continue, that their Humour has been comply'd with, and to this day they are tolerated.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day I was there, the <HI>Alguazils</HI> came to the Gate, which is at the end of the <HI>Li&s;t,</HI> to fetch the &s;ix <HI>Knights</HI> (of whom the Count <HI>de Connismark</HI> was one) which offer'd them|&s;elves to Combat. Their Hor&s;es are hand&s;ome to admiration and mo&s;t richly harna&s;s'd: Be&s;ides tho&s;e they ride on, they had each of them a dozen led by Grooms, with as many Mules loaded with <HI>Rejones</HI> or <HI>Garochons,</HI> which are, as I have &s;aid, Launces made of very dry Fir, about four or five foot long, painted and gilt, and the Iron-work very well poli&s;h'd; and the Mules were cover'd with Velvet Cloths of the &s;ame colour of the Combatants, with their Arms embroider'd in Gold: This is not practis'd at all <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> when the City orders one, there's far le&s;s Magnificence; but as the <HI>King</HI> commanded this, and it was upon his Marriage, nothing was omitted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were dre&s;t in black, embroider'd either with Gold and Silver, Silk or Bugles; they had white Plumes of Feathers &s;potted with &s;everal colours, and a rich knot of Diamonds, with a Hat-band of the &s;ame. They had Scarfs, &s;ome white, and others crim&s;on, blue and yellow, embroidered with Gold. Some wore them round their Wa&s;t, others over their Shoul|ders
<PB N="188" REF="97"> like a Belt, and others about their Arm; the&s;e la&s;t were narrow and &s;hort, without doubt their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented them, for commonly they run to plea&s;e them, and to &s;hew that there's no danger to which they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves for their diver&s;ion. They had al&s;o a black Cloak which wrapt them about, but the ends being thrown behind them, it did not hinder their Arms: they wore little white Buskins, with long guilt Spurs, which have only one &s;harp point after the <HI>Moors</HI> fa&s;hion; they al&s;o &s;it a Hor&s;e like them, which is called <HI>Cavalgas a la gineta.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were hand&s;omly mounted, and lookt grace|fully enough for this Country; they were nobly born, and eve|ry one had forty Foot-men, &s;ome cloath'd in gold Mohair trim'd with Lace; others in Carnation-colour'd Brocado, &s;tript with Gold and Silver, and the re&s;t in &s;ome other fa&s;hion. Every one of them was dre&s;t like a Stranger, whether 'twas <HI>Turk, Hungari|an, Moor, Indian,</HI> or wild People. Several of the Foot-men carried a bundle of the&s;e <HI>Garochons</HI> I have mentioned, and this lookt very well: Thus with all their Train they cro&s;t the <HI>Plaza Mayor,</HI> conducted by the &s;ix <HI>Alguazils,</HI> and the Trumpets &s;ounding. They came before the <HI>King's</HI> Balcony, and made a profound Reverence to him, and de&s;ired leave of him to fight the <HI>Bulls,</HI> which he granted them, and wi&s;ht them Victory. Then the Trumpets every where began to &s;ound again, and this is done, as 'twere, in defiance of the Bulls. All the People fall a &s;houting, and repeat <HI>Viva, viva los bravos Cavalleros:</HI> After this they &s;eparate, and &s;alute the Ladies of their Acquaintance. All the Foot-men go out of the <HI>Li&s;t,</HI> except two for each Knight, which are left to carry their <HI>Rejoues;</HI> they keep clo&s;e to their Ma&s;ters, and 'tis very &s;eldom that they for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>Several young Men enter into the place, and they come a great way off to fight on the&s;e days: The&s;e I now &s;peak of are a foot, and not being nobly born, they u&s;e no Ceremonies with them. Whil&s;t one <HI>Cavallero</HI> is fighting, the re&s;t withdraw, but not out of the Bars; and they do not a&s;&s;ault that Bull which another has undertaken to fight, unle&s;s he makes at them. The fir&s;t to whom the Bull comes when they are altogether, is he that fights him. When he has wounded the <HI>Knight,</HI> they cry out, <HI>fileno es Empenno,</HI> that is to &s;ay, it is an Obligation upon &s;uch an one to revenge the <HI>Affront</HI> he has received from the Bull; and indeed Honour engages him, either on Hor&s;eback, or a foot, to attack the Bull, and give him a cut with his Sword, as I have &s;aid, either upon his Head or Throat, without &s;triking him in any other part. Afterwards he may fight him
<PB N="189" REF="97"> as he will, and &s;trike him where he can; but in doing this, ones Life is a thou&s;and times in danger. When this blow is given, if the Knights are a foot, they may mount their Hor|&s;es.</P>
<P>When the King thought it was time to begin the <HI>Baiting,</HI> two <HI>Alguazils</HI> come under his Balcony, and he gives to <HI>Don John</HI> the Keys of the Stable where the Bulls are &s;ecur'd; for the King keeps the Key, and when it mu&s;t be thrown, he delivers it into the hands of a <HI>Privado,</HI> or Chief Mini&s;ter, as a Favour. Im|mediately the Trumpets &s;ound, the Timbrels and the Drums, the Fifes and the Haut-boys, the Flutes and Bagpipes make a noi&s;e round the Place one after another; and the <HI>Alguazils,</HI> who are naturally great Cowards, go trembling to open the Doors where the Bulls are kept. There was a Man hid behind the door, who &s;hut it as fa&s;t as he could, and then by a Ladder climb'd up to the top of the Stable; for 'tis u&s;ual with the Bull, in coming out, to look behind the door, and to begin his Ex|pedition by killing, if he can, the Man that &s;tands there: after that he falls a running with all his might after the <HI>Alguazils,</HI> who &s;pur their Hor&s;es to &s;ave them&s;elves, for they are not allow'd to &s;tand upon their defence, and their be&s;t play is to run away. Tho&s;e Men which are on foot, throw at him Arrows and very &s;harp Darts, which are trim'd with Cutt-paper; the&s;e Darts &s;tick in him in &s;uch a manner, that the pain cau&s;ing him to &s;tir much, makes the Iron enter deeper; be&s;ides, when he runs, the Paper makes a noi&s;e, and being on fire, vexes him extream|ly; his Breath looks like a thick mi&s;t about him, his Eyes and his No&s;trils are like fire, he runs &s;wifter than a Race-hor&s;e, and holds it much better; to &s;peak truth, he &s;trikes Terror. The Knight who is to fight him comes near him, takes a <HI>Rejon,</HI> holds it like a Ponyard, the Bull makes up to him, he declines his blow, and thru&s;ts his <HI>Gorachon</HI> at him; the Bull &s;o thru&s;ts it back, that the Wood being weak, it breaks, immediately his Foot-men, who hold ten or twelve dozen, pre&s;ent him with another, which the <HI>Cavallero</HI> thru&s;ts al&s;o into his Body; with this the Bull falls a bellowing, grows angry, runs, leaps, and woe be to them that &s;tand in his way: And if at any time he is ready to run at a Man, a Cloak or a Hat is thrown at him, and this &s;tops him; or el&s;e, one falls down on the Ground, and the Bull in running, pa&s;&s;es over him. They have al&s;o great Figures made of Pa&s;t-bords, with which they deceive him, and &s;o gain time to e&s;cape. That which helps them further is, that the Bull con&s;tantly &s;huts his Eyes ju&s;t before he pu&s;hes with his Horns, and they are &s;o quick in that moment to avoid the
<PB N="190" REF="98"> blow; but yet this is not &s;o certain, but that a great many peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;aw a <HI>Black,</HI> with a &s;hort Poniard, go directly to the Bull, when he was in the height of his Fury, and between his Horns thru&s;t it into the very &s;eam of his Skull, which is a place very &s;oft and ea&s;ie to be pierced, but withal, very &s;mall to hit. This was one of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t dextrous blows that can be imagin'd. The Bull fell down dead upon the &s;pot; and pre|&s;ently the Trumpets &s;ounded, and &s;everal <HI>Spaniards</HI> ran with their Swords in their Hands, to cut in pieces the Bea&s;t that was no longer able to hurt them. When a Bull is kill'd, four <HI>Alguazils</HI> go out to fetch four Mules, which &s;ome Grooms, cloath'd in yellow, and Carnation-colour'd Satin, lead in. They are covered with Feathers and little &s;ilver Bells; they have &s;il|ken Traces, with which they tye the Bull, and &s;o draw him away; upon which the Trumpets and People make a prodigi|ous noi&s;e: There were twenty baited the fir&s;t day. There came out a furious one which very dangerou&s;ly wounded <HI>Count Co|nismark</HI> in his Leg, and yet the force of the blow did not light upon him, but upon his Hor&s;e, whom it bur&s;t; he quickly got off him, and though he is no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet he would not be excus'd from any of the Laws, It would have drawn pity from any body to &s;ee one of the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in the World in &s;uch a condition; he ran violently about the place, &s;triking fire with his feet, and kill'd a Man with a blow upon his Head and Brea&s;t: The great Rayle was open'd for him, and he went out. As for the <HI>Count,</HI> as &s;oon as he was wounded, a very fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady, who believ'd that he fought for her &s;ake, &s;tood forward in her Balcony, and with her Handkerchief made &s;eve|ral &s;igns, in all likelihood to encourage him, but he did not &s;eem to need being animated; and although he had lo&s;t abun|dance of Blood, and was forc'd to lean upon one of his Foot|men, who held him up, yet with great fiercene&s;s he advanc'd with his Sword in his Hand, made a &s;hift to give a very great wound to the Bull on his Head; and then pre&s;ently turning him&s;elf towards that &s;ide where this young Lady, for whom he fought, was, he ki&s;s'd his Sword, and &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be carry'd away by his People half dead.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not think that the&s;e &s;ort of accidents interrupt the <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> 'tis &s;aid, that it will not end but by the King's Or|der; &s;o that when any <HI>Knight</HI> is wounded, the others accom|pany him to the Bars, and immediately they return to fight. There was a <HI>Bi&s;canier</HI> &s;o bold, as to throw him&s;elf off his Hor&s;e upon the back of the Bull, held him by his Horns, and in &s;pight of
<PB N="191" REF="98"> all the endeavours of the Animal to throw him off, yet the <HI>Bi&s;|canier</HI> &s;et upon him for above a quarter of an hour, and broke one of his Horns. If the Bulls defend them&s;elves too long, and that the King would have others come out, (for fre&s;h ones af|ford more delight, becau&s;e every one has his particular manner of fighting) they turn loo&s;e &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dogs; the&s;e are not &s;o big as is generally &s;een there, but 'tis a breed &s;omething like tho&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> carry'd into the <HI>Indies</HI> when they con|quer'd them; they are &s;mall and low, but &s;o &s;trong, that when they once &s;eize the Throat, you may &s;ooner cut them in pieces than make them let go their hold. They are very fre|quently kill'd, the Bull takes them upon his Horns, and to&s;&s;es them up in the Air like Foot-balls; &s;ometimes they ham&s;tring the Bull with certain Irons made cro&s;s-wi&s;e, which they put at the end of a long Pole, and this they call <HI>Jaretar al toro.</HI></P>
<P>There was another <HI>Cavallero</HI> under the <HI>Empenno,</HI> becau&s;e in fighting, his Hat fell off; he did not alight, but drew his Sword, and pu&s;hing his Hor&s;e upon the Bull which expected him, gave him a wound in the Neck; but as it was a &s;light one, &s;o it &s;erv'd only to enrage him the more: He tore up the Earth with his Feet, he roar'd, and he leapt about like a Stag. I cannot well de&s;cribe to you this Combat, nor the Acclamations of every body, the claping of hands, nor the multitude of Hand|kerchiefs which are thrown up in the air, for an Expre&s;&s;ion of Admiration, &s;ome crying out, <HI>Victor, Victor,</HI> and others <HI>Ha Toro, Ha Toro,</HI> the more to excite the Bulls fury. Neither can I tell you my particular di&s;turbance, and how my Heart fail'd me every time I &s;aw the&s;e terrible Creatures ready to kill tho&s;e brave <HI>Cavallero's:</HI> the&s;e things are equally impo&s;&s;ible to me.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Toledian,</HI> both young and hand&s;ome, which could not avoid being wounded by the horns of the Bull, who to&s;s'd him up very high, he immediately died; there were two others mortally wounded, and four Hor&s;es either kill'd or de&s;perately hurt, and yet every body &s;aid, it had not been a <HI>fine Baiting,</HI> becau&s;e there was &s;o little Blood &s;hed; and to have been &s;uch, there &s;hould have been at the lea&s;t, ten Men kill'd upon the Spot. It is hard to de&s;cribe the Dexterity of the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> in fighting, and that of the Hor&s;es in avoiding the Bull. They'll turn &s;ometimes an hour about him, and tho they be not a foot di&s;tant from him, yet he is not able to touch them, but when he does hit them, he wounds them cruelly. The King threw Fifteen Pi&s;tols to the <HI>Black</HI> that kill'd the Bull with his <HI>Ponyard,</HI> and he gave as much to one that had &s;ubdu'd another, and &s;aid, he would remember the Knights that had fought.</P>
<PB N="192" REF="99">
<P>I ob&s;erv'd a <HI>Ca&s;tillian,</HI> who knew not how to defend him&s;elf, jump upon a Bull, as nimble as a bird. The&s;e <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> are fine, great and magnificent; 'tis a noble Sight, and co&s;ts abundance; One cannot give a ju&s;t De&s;cription of it, it mu&s;t be &s;een to be well under&s;tood. But I a&s;&s;ure you that all this did not plea&s;e me; Do but think if a Man that is very dear to you, &s;hould be &s;o ra&s;h to go and expo&s;e him&s;elf again&s;t a furious Bea&s;t, and that for your &s;ake, (for generally that's the Motive) you &s;ee him brought back weltering in his Blood, and half dead, is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;ay, for you or any one, to approve of &s;uch Actions and the&s;e Cu&s;toms? Nay &s;uppo&s;e one had no particular concern, would one de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at &s;uch Sports, that co&s;t the Lives of &s;o many Men? For my part, I wonder that in a King|dom, where their King bears the name of <HI>Catholick,</HI> there &s;hould be &s;uch barbarous Diver&s;ions permitted. I am &s;atisfied that 'tis very ancient, becau&s;e they derive it from the <HI>Moors;</HI> but yet methinks this, as well as divers other Cu&s;toms which they have from tho&s;e <HI>Infidels,</HI> ought to be entirely aboli&s;ht.</P>
<P><HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> ob&s;erving me very much di&s;turb'd and unea&s;ie during the <HI>Baiting,</HI> and taking notice, that I was &s;ometimes as pale as death, I was &s;o much frighted to &s;ee &s;ome of tho&s;e kill'd which fought, &s;aid to me in &s;miling, what would you have done Madam, if you had &s;een what had happen'd &s;ome years ago? A <HI>Cavallero</HI> of worth, pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd a young Woman, who was only a Jeweller's Daughter, but a perfect Beauty, and was to have a great E&s;tate. This <HI>Cavallero</HI> having under&s;tood, that the mo&s;t furious Bulls of the Mountains were taken, and thinking it would be a very glorious Action to vanqui&s;h them, re&s;olved to <HI>Taurize</HI> as they call it, and for that end de&s;ired leave of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. She was &s;o &s;urpriz'd at the bare propo&s;al only which he made, that &s;he &s;wooned away, and by all that Power which he had given her over him&s;elf, &s;he charged him not to think of it, as he valued his Life. But in &s;pite of this Charge he believed he could not give a more ample proof of his Love, and therefore privately, caus'd all things nece&s;&s;ary to be got rea|dy in order thereunto. But as indu&s;trious as he was to hide his de&s;ign from his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he was informed of it, and u&s;ed all means to di&s;&s;wade him from it. In fine, the day of this <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> be|ing come, he conjur'd her to be there, and told her, that her very pre&s;ence would be &s;ufficient to make him conquer, and to acquire a Glory, which would render him yet more worthy of her. Your Love, &s;ays &s;he, is more ambitious than 'tis kind, and mine is more kind than 'tis ambitious. Go where you think Glory calls you, you have a mind I &s;hould be there, you will
<PB N="193" REF="99"> fight before me; well, I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I will be there, but yet perhaps my pre&s;ence will afford you more matter of Trouble than Emulation. However he left her, and went to the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> where there was already a mighty A&s;&s;embly; but &s;carce had he begun to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the fierce Bull which a&s;&s;aulted him, when a Country Youth threw a dart at this Terrible Creature, which pierced him &s;o deep, that it put him to a great deal of pain. He immediately left the <HI>Cavalero</HI> that was fighting him, and roaring ran directly after him that wounded him, this Youth thus frighted would have &s;aved him|&s;elf, when his Cap which cover'd his head fell off, and then the lovelie&s;t and the longe&s;t hair which could be &s;een appeared up|on his &s;houlders, and this di&s;covered it to be a Maid of about Fifteen or &s;ixteen Years of Age. Fear had put her in &s;uch a Trembling, that &s;he could neither run, nor any way avoid the Bull. He gave her a de&s;perate pu&s;h on the &s;ide, at the &s;ame in&s;tant her Lover knew that it was &s;he, and was running to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Good God! what a grief it was for him to &s;ee his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s in this &s;ad Condition! Pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ported him, he no longer valued his Life, and grew more furious than the Bull, and performed things almo&s;t incredible. He was mor|tally wounded in divers places. On this Day, certainly the People, thought the <HI>Baiting fine,</HI> they carried the&s;e two unfor|tunate Lovers to her unhappy Father's Hou&s;e, they both de&s;ired to be in the &s;ame Chamber, and though they had but a little time to live, yet beg'd the Favour they might be married, ac|cordingly they were married, and &s;ince they could not live together, yet at lea&s;t were they buried together, in one and the &s;ame Grave. The Story has mightily increa&s;ed the Aver|&s;ion I had already conceived again&s;t the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> and I told <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> &s;o, after I had thank'd him for his pains in relating it to me.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;aid nothing to you concerning the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language, in which I am endeavouring to make &s;ome Pro|gre&s;s. It plea&s;es me extreamly, it is expre&s;&s;ive, noble, and grave, Love finds it commodious for its work, and can play the fool prettily enough in it. The Courtiers &s;peak more conci&s;ely than others, they make u&s;e of &s;uch ab&s;tracted Com|pari&s;ons and Metaphors, that unle&s;s one is us'd to hear them, half their meaning is lo&s;t. I have learnt &s;everal Languages, or at lea&s;t under&s;tand the fir&s;t Rudiments of them, but yet in my mind, it is only our <HI>own</HI> which exceeds the <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI></P>

In it there is carried all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, for the Country through which they pa&s;s is &s;o very barren, that on Mountains which are four&s;core Leagues broad, the bigge&s;t tree one meets with is a little wild Tyme, there's in't neither Inn nor Inn-keep|ers, you &s;leep in the <HI>Gally,</HI> and 'tis a mi&s;erable Country for Travellers.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Mollini</HI> the <HI>Popes Nuncio,</HI> con&s;ecrated the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> on Trinity Sunday, and the <HI>King</HI> was there. I &s;aw him come in, he had a Black Suit and a gold coloured Silk Belt on, and little Pearls were &s;et round the flowers, his hat was &s;o broad which they never cock here, that the Brims laid upon his &s;houlders, and lookt ill. I ob&s;erved, that during the Ceremony he eat of &s;omething which was held to him in a Pa|per, they told me it was either Leeks or Shallots, of which he eats very often. I was too far off, to &s;ee him well, he did not return to <HI>Buenretiro,</HI> becau&s;e of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti-day,</HI> at which Ceremony he would a&s;&s;i&s;t. In coming out of the <HI>Church,</HI> I knew a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman who&s;e Name is <HI>Juncas,</HI> he is of <HI>Bur|deaux,</HI> where I &s;aw him, I ask'd him how long he had been here: he told me but a little while, and that his fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s had been to have &s;een me, had he not been engag'd at <HI>Bayon,</HI> not to lo&s;e a minute's time, in the &s;earch of a very wicked Fel|low, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be hid at <HI>Madrid;</HI> That it was not the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> con&s;ecrated, which drew him to the <HI>Hieronimites,</HI> (otherwi&s;e the Daugh|ters of the <HI>Conception</HI>) but that having de&s;ired to &s;peak with one of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> he was told, that he could not &s;ee her till the <HI>King</HI> was gone.

<PB N="195" REF="100"> to have &s;een her as I have gone by, and intreated him to tell me the matter. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>too long and melancholy a Mi&s;|chance to relate pre&s;ently; but if you will &s;ee the young</HI> Nun <HI>I &s;peak of, I am per&s;uaded &s;he'll not be unplea&s;ant to you.</HI> I willingly accepted his Offer, becau&s;e I have &s;o often been told, that they have &s;o much more wit in <HI>Mona&s;teries,</HI> then el&s;ewhere in the world. We went into a Parlour, which had three &s;uch ter|rible Iron-doors with &s;pikes, as made me wonder. How is this, &s;aid I? It has been told me, that the <HI>Nuns</HI> in this Coun|try are very amorous, but I cannot be per&s;uaded, that <HI>Love</HI> is bold enough to venture over the&s;e long Spikes, and through the&s;e little holes, where one mu&s;t undoubtedly peri&s;h. <HI>You are deceived,</HI> Madam, cri'd <HI>Juncas, at the Appearances of things; if the Lady which is coming, can &s;pare me &s;o much time, I'll pre|&s;ently tell you, what I learnt of a friend of mine a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>the fir&s;t Journey I made hither.</HI> But at the very in&s;tant, <HI>Donna I&s;idora</HI> came into the Parlour. I found her much hand&s;omer, than I had fancy'd her in my own Mind to be. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Juncas</HI> told her, that I was a <HI>French</HI> Lady which had a great mind to be acquainted with her, upon his report of her Merits. She thankt me in a very mode&s;t manner, and afterwards told us, that it was very true, that the Wretch after whom Enqui|ry was made, had been lately at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but that &s;he was certain he was not now there, and that he had even had the Im|pudence to write to her by the hands of a Man where he lodg'd; that the Letter was brought to her after his Departure, and that &s;he would not receive it. It &s;eems to me, &s;aid I, inter|rupting of her, that he could not be taken, &s;uppo&s;ing he were yet here. Sometimes, &s;ays <HI>Donna I&s;idora,</HI> Permi&s;&s;ion is ob|tain'd from the <HI>King.</HI> There are certain Crimes for which there is no <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> and that is one of them. She fell a weeping, notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours to hinder her tears, and added, that thanks be to Heaven, &s;he could not re|proach her &s;elf with any thing in the late Bu&s;ine&s;s, but yet &s;he could not forbear grieving extreamly that &s;he had been the cau&s;e of it. We talk'd together a good while longer, and I was as much charm'd with her Wit as with her Beauty. Af|terwards I withdrew.

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>ONE mu&s;t love you as mightily as I do Dear Cou&s;in to re|&s;olve to write to you in a Sea&s;on when the Weather is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive hot: Whatever has been told me, and whatever I could imagine of it, is nothing in compari&s;on to what I now feel. To defend my &s;elf from the heat, I leave open all my Windows all night long, without fearing the <HI>Gallick</HI> Winds which criple a body. I &s;leep bare-head, I put my Hands and Feet in Snow, enough to kill one; but I think 'tis much at one to dye, as to be &s;mother'd with heat, as they are here. 'Tis Mid-night before one feels the lea&s;t breath of Air from the We&s;tern <HI>Briezes.</HI></P>
<P>In going to take the Air, one is &s;ufficiently puzled; for if the Gla&s;&s;es are open, one's chok'd with the Du&s;t, of which the Streets are &s;o full that one can hardly &s;ee, and although the Windows of the Hou&s;es are &s;hut, the Du&s;t finds a way through and &s;poils all Hou&s;hold Goods; &s;o that what with the ugly &s;mells in the Winter, and the du&s;t in the Summer, all things of Silver, and every thing el&s;e is &s;o tarni&s;h'd and &s;poyl'd, that little can be kept hand&s;om any con&s;iderable time: Notwith|&s;tanding all care at pre&s;ent, ones face will be cover'd with &s;weat and du&s;t, like tho&s;e Wre&s;tlers which are repre&s;ented to us in a Ring.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now tell you that I have &s;een the Ceremony on <HI>Cor|pus Chri&s;ti-day,</HI> which is very &s;olemnly kept here: There's a general <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of all the Pari&s;hes and Mona&s;teries, which are very numerous; the Streets thr&ocirc; which the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> is to pa&s;s, are hung with the riche&s;t Tapi&s;try in the World; for I do not only &s;peak of that which belongs to the Crown which is there, but al&s;o of that which belongs to a thou&s;and particu|lar Per&s;ons which have mo&s;t admirable Tapi&s;try. All the Bal|conies are then without their Lattices adorn'd with Carpets, rich Cu&s;hions, and Canopies: they hang Ticking cro&s;s the Streets to hinder the Sun from being trouble&s;om, and they throw water upon it, to make the Air cooler: All the Streets are &s;pread with Sand, well water'd, and fill'd with &s;o great a quantity of Flowers, that one can hardly tread upon any thing el&s;e. The Repo&s;itories are extraordinary large, and adorn'd with the greate&s;t &s;plendor.</P>

<P>No Women go in the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> was there in a black Lute-&s;tring Taffety Suit, a Sholder-belt of blue Silk edg'd with white; his Sleeves were of white Taffety, embroider'd with Silk and Bugles; they were very long and open before: he had little Sleeves hanging down to his Wa&s;te, his Cloak was wrapt about his Arm, and he had on his Collar of Gold and precious Stones, at which there hung a little &s;heep in Diamonds: He had al&s;o Diamond Buckles at his Shooes and Garters, and a great Hat-band of the &s;ame, which &s;hin'd like the Sun; he had like|wi&s;e a knot which button'd up his Hatt, and at the bottom of that a Pearl which they call the <HI>Pereagrine,</HI> it is as big as the Ru&s;&s;et Pear, and of the &s;ame &s;hape; it is pretended to be the fine&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that both its colour and kind is in perfecti|on. The whole <HI>Court</HI> without exception, follow'd the Holy Sacrament, the <HI>Councils</HI> walk'd after it without any Order or Precedency, as they happen'd to be, holding white Wax Candles in their hands; the <HI>King</HI> had one, and went foremo&s;t, next the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> where the <HI>Sacrament</HI> was. It is certainly one of the fine&s;t Ceremonies that can be &s;een. I ob&s;erv'd that all the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber had a great gold Key by their &s;ides, it opens the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, into which they can go when they will; it is as big as a Cellar-door Key: I there &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> who wore every one a <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of <HI>Malta,</HI> made of <HI>Holland,</HI> and embroider'd upon their Cloaks; it was near two a Clock, and the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> was not yet gone in; when it pa&s;t by the <HI>Palace,</HI> they fir'd &s;everal Rockets, and other Inventions.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> went to meet the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, which is a Church near the Palace.

There you gather more than one Crop in a Year; the Lakes and Ponds are full of Fi&s;h, the Grounds are well &s;tockt with Cattel, the Fore&s;ts and Woods afford excellent Fowl and wild Bea&s;ts, the Earth &s;eems to open her Bowels on purpo&s;e to give up the Gold &s;he enclo&s;es, there are Mines or Rocks of precious Stones di&s;cover'd, and Pearl are there taken.

This De&s;cription Charms, but as 'tis a long Voyage, it may be convenient, if you plea&s;e, Madam, &s;aid I, to <HI>Donna Tereza</HI> in &s;miling, to get our Supper before we go; I immediately took her by the hand, and we came into a Parlour, where I had provided the be&s;t Mu&s;icians, which are bad enough, and which in my Opi|nion, have nothing to recommend them but their dearne&s;s. My Cook made us &s;ome <HI>Ragous</HI> afte the <HI>French</HI> way, which <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> found &s;o excellent, that &s;he de&s;ir'd I would let her have the Receipt how to do them. <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> intreated me al&s;o, to let him have &s;ome of my <HI>Larding-Pins,</HI> of which really one may look all over <HI>Spain,</HI> and not find &s;o much as one.

<P>There are certain days in the year, that every body goes out to take the Air upon the Bridges which cro&s;s the River <HI>Man&s;anarez;</HI> but at pre&s;ent all Coaches are laid up, the Gravel and &s;ome little Brooks help to make it very cool and plea&s;ant.

Here's one thing very &s;ingular, and that which is not allow'd of in any other Coun|try; and that is, That <HI>Foundlings,</HI> or Children found by chance are reckon'd <HI>Noble,</HI> and bear the Title of <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> and enjoy all the Priviledges annext to the Nobility; but to this end, they mu&s;t prove, that they were <HI>Foundlings,</HI> and were main|tain'd and bred in the <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> where &s;uch Children are kept.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ome great Families which hold almo&s;t all their E&s;tates by the Title of <HI>Mayorargo;</HI> and when it happens that all of the Name are dead, and that the next akin is a Male, though he be a natural Son, yet he &s;hall Inherit; and for want of &s;uch, the elde&s;t Dome&s;tick &s;hall take the Name and the Arms of his Ma&s;ter, and inherit his E&s;tate: And this is one rea&s;on why the younger Brothers of other Hou&s;es, as Noble and Illu|&s;trious, do not &s;corn to be Servants to the&s;e, and their hopes are pretty well grounded; for it often happens that Families are extinct, becau&s;e the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women have fewer Children than the Women of other Countries.</P>
<P>There lately happen'd a very great misfortune to a young Woman of Quality called <HI>Donna Clora;</HI> &s;he could not pre&s;erve her Heart again&s;t the Charms of <HI>Count de Ca&s;trillo,</HI> a Man of the Court, very witty and hand&s;om; the <HI>Cavallero</HI> had the &s;e|cret to plea&s;e her without de&s;igning it; he was ignorant of the Inclinations &s;he had for him, and &s;o did not improve his Happi|ne&s;s.
<PB N="207" REF="106"> And although the Father of this amiable Creature was ab&s;ent, yet &s;he did not enjoy the more Liberty, becau&s;e her Brother, who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Henriques,</HI> to who&s;e care her Father had recommended her, continually watcht over her Actions and Behaviour; &s;he dur&s;t not &s;peak to him &s;he lov'd, and this was a double Martyrdom, not to be able to make her Complaints, and to divide her Grief with him that caus'd it: But at la&s;t &s;he re&s;olv'd to write to him, and to find out &s;ome way that the Letter &s;hould come to his hands; but as this was a bu&s;ine&s;s of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to her, &s;o &s;he was at a &s;tand about the choice of a Confident; and here &s;he &s;topt for &s;ome time, till at la&s;t &s;he bethought her &s;elf of a Friend of hers, who had always te&s;tify'd abundance of kindne&s;s for her, and &s;o with|out further con&s;ideration, &s;he writ a very moving Letter to the <HI>Count de Ca&s;trillo,</HI> and was going to her Friend to intreat him to get it deliver'd to this <HI>Cavallero,</HI> when &s;he &s;aw him pa&s;s clo&s;e by her Chair; this &s;ight of him encreas'd her de&s;ires to let him know her mind, and immediately taking this opportunity for her &s;elf, threw the Letter &s;he had in her hand to him, at the &s;ame time feigning, that this was a Letter which he had gi|ven to her as he went by; <HI>Know my Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, aloud with an angry look, <HI>That it is not to me you ought to addre&s;s your &s;elf upon &s;uch a de&s;ign as yours. Here, take the Letter, which I will not &s;o much as open.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> had too much Wit not to ap|prehend pre&s;ently the favourable intention of this fair one. You need not complain, Madam, &s;ays he to her, that I have not made u&s;e of your Advice; he quickly withdrew to read a Let|ter which mu&s;t needs give him abundance of Plea&s;ure: by this means he was inform'd of <HI>Donna Clora</HI>'s Intentions, and what he mu&s;t do to &s;ee her. He omitted nothing, he became de|&s;parately in Love, and thought him&s;elf, as he had rea&s;on, one of the happie&s;t <HI>Cavalleros</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> They impatiently expected the return of her Father, that they might propo&s;e the Marriage to him, which in all likelyhood mu&s;t have been very acceptable to him.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the Precautions that the&s;e young Lo|vers took both certainly to fix and continue a Conver&s;ation, which was the Joy of their Life; yet the &s;u&s;picious and watch|ful <HI>Henriques</HI> di&s;cover'd their Intreague.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, though it was known, that he was the Author of &s;o wicked an Action, yet he was not pro&s;ecuted, for he had too much Credit and Intere&s;t; and be&s;ides, this poor Gentle|woman had no kindred but what was his, and they were un|willing to encrea&s;e the Misfortunes of their Family, which were already but too great.</P>
<P>After this wicked Fact, <HI>Henriques</HI> feign'd a great fit of Devo|tion; he appear'd no more in Publick, and had <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> &s;aid at his Hou&s;e, and &s;aw very few People; for he was very apprehen&s;ive that <HI>Count Ca&s;trillo</HI> (who had not di&s;&s;embl'd his Grief, but had let it vi&s;ibly appear) would at la&s;t be reveng'd for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, for indeed he mo&s;t carefully &s;ought all Opportunities. At length, after having attempted all imaginable ways, he found out one which &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>He di&s;guis'd him&s;elf like an <HI>Aguador,</HI> that is, a Water-Bearer, the&s;e &s;ort of People load an A&s;s with &s;everal great Pitchers, and &s;o carry them about the City; they wear thick coar&s;e Cloth, their Legs are naked, and their Shooes are either cut or &s;la&s;ht, or el&s;e they have Soals made fa&s;t with Strings. Our Lover thus di&s;guis'd waited all day long leaning upon the &s;ide of a <HI>Spring|well,</HI> who&s;e waters he increas'd by his Tears; for this <HI>Well</HI> was ju&s;t again&s;t the Hou&s;e where he had &s;o often &s;een his dear and fair <HI>Clara,</HI> and there it was al&s;o, where the inhumane <HI>Henriques</HI> dwelt. As the <HI>Count</HI> kept his Eyes continually upon this Hou&s;e, he perceiv'd one of the Ca&s;ements half open, and at the &s;ame time his Enemy to draw near it, he had a Looking-Gla&s;s in his Hand, in which he was looking him&s;elf. Immediately the cun|ning <HI>Aquator</HI> threw &s;ome Cherry-&s;tones at him, in a je&s;ting way, and &s;ome of them having hit his Face, <HI>Don Henriques</HI> af|fronted at the In&s;olence of a Man, which appear'd to him to be only a poor <HI>Aguador,</HI> and tran&s;ported with the fir&s;t motions of his Anger, came down alone to cha&s;tize him: But he was hard|ly in the Street, when the <HI>Count</HI> di&s;cover'd him&s;elf, and draw|ing his Sword, which for his purpo&s;e he kept hid, cry'd out, <HI>Traytor that thou art, think of defending thy Life.</HI> The &s;urprize and the fright had &s;o amaz'd <HI>Don Henriques,</HI> that he was only able to ask quarter; but he could not obtain it from this enra|ged Lover, who came to revenge the Death of his Mi&s;tre&s;s up|on him that had &s;o cruelly murder'd her. This <HI>Count</HI> would have found it very hard to have e&s;cap'd, upon his doing &s;uch an Action ju&s;t at the door of a Man of note, and that had abun|dance of Servants; but in that very moment that all <HI>Don Hen|riques</HI> People were &s;allying out upon the <HI>Count,</HI> happily for him, the Duke <HI>Duzeda</HI> came by with three of his Friends, they
<PB N="209" REF="107"> immediately came out of their Coach, and re&s;cued him &s;o &s;ea|&s;onably, that he made his E&s;cape, and we do not yet hear where he is; I am concern'd for him, becau&s;e I know him, and that he is a very hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>It is very common in this Country, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate one for &s;e|veral Cau&s;es, and Cu&s;tom even authorizes the Fact, for every angry Difference; for example, If one give an other a Box o'th' Ear, or &s;trikes him on the Face with his Hat, his Handkerchief, or his Glove, or has wrong'd him, in calling him <HI>Drunkard,</HI> or lets drop any words that reflect on the Virtue of his Wife, the&s;e things I &s;ay mu&s;t be no otherwi&s;e reveng'd than by A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion; but they give this Rea&s;on, that after &s;uch Affronts, it would not be ju&s;t for a Man to venture his Life in &s;ingle Com|bate upon equal terms, where the <HI>Offended</HI> might peri&s;h by the hand of the <HI>Aggre&s;&s;or.</HI> They'll keep a Revenge twenty Years together if they cannot &s;ooner meet with a fit Occa&s;ion to exe|cute it: and if they happen to die before they have got Satis|faction, they leave their Children Inheritors of their Re&s;ent|ments as well as of their E&s;tates, and the be&s;t way for a Man that hath given any Affront to another, is for ever to for&s;ake his Country. I was lately told of a con&s;iderable Man, that after he had liv'd twenty Years in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to avoid an ill turn from another to whom he had given &s;ome Offence, and having un|der&s;tood that not only he but his Son was dead, believ'd him|&s;elf &s;ecure. He returns to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after he had taken care to change his Name that he might not be known; but all this was not able to &s;ave him, for the Grand&s;on of him that thought him&s;elf abus'd, though he was but twelve Years old, caus'd this Per&s;on to be murder'd quickly after his return.</P>
<P>The Men that committed the&s;e horrid Actions are commonly hir'd from <HI>Valentia;</HI> It is a City in <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e People are wicked to exce&s;s; there's not any Crime which they will not de|liberately commit for Money; they wear <HI>Stillettos,</HI> and Fire Arms which go off without any noi&s;e. There are two &s;orts of the&s;e <HI>Stillettos,</HI> one about the length of a &s;hort Ponyard, but not thicker than a thick needle, and made of excellent Steel, &s;quare and &s;harp edg'd. This In&s;trument wounds mortally for entring very deep, and making no bigger an Orifice than an needle; no Blood comes out, nay hardly can one perceive the place where it entred, and &s;o being impo&s;&s;ible to dre&s;s it, they almo&s;t con&s;tantly die. The other &s;ort is longer, and no thicker than the little finger, but &s;o hard and &s;trong that I have &s;een one of them at one blow &s;truck throw a thick Walnut-Tree Table. The&s;e &s;ort of Arms are forbidden to be carry'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> as
<PB N="210" REF="108"> <HI>Bayonnets</HI> are in <HI>France;</HI> neither is it lawful to carry tho&s;e Poc|ket-Pi&s;tols which fire without noi&s;e; but yet notwith&s;tanding the Prohibition, &s;everal Per&s;ons make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>I have been told, that a Per&s;on of Quality thinking he had a ju&s;t cau&s;e to de&s;troy one of his Enemies, went to a <HI>Bandolero</HI> of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and gave him a Sum of Money to murder him, but afterwards he was reconciled to his Enemy; and being willing to u&s;e a good Con&s;cience, he made it his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to acquaint the <HI>Bandolero</HI> with what had pa&s;t, that &s;o he might have a care not to kill this Man. The <HI>Bandolero</HI> &s;eeing his Service needle&s;s, offer'd to return the Money, but he that gave it, entreated him to keep it; <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am a Man of Honour, I &s;hall keep your Money, and I will kill your Man.</HI> The other earne&s;tly begg'd him to do nothing, &s;eeing they were now friends. <HI>Look you,</HI> &s;ays he to him, <HI>all that I can do, is to give you your choice, whe|ther it &s;hall be you or him, for to gain your Money hone&s;tly, there's a nece&s;&s;ity I mu&s;t kill one of you.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding all the Entreaties of this Per&s;on, he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, and execu|ted it. It had been an ea&s;ie matter to have &s;eiz'd him, but there was too much danger in't; for tho&s;e <HI>Bandoleros</HI> are &s;o nu|merous and united, that if any one of them &s;hould be executed, the Death of him is certainly and quickly reveng'd. The&s;e Wretches are never without a Li&s;t of their wicked Actions they have committed, and count it an honour to them; and when any one would &s;et them on work, they &s;hew that, and ask, whether they de&s;ire them quickly di&s;patch'd, or to give them a langui&s;hing Wound. The&s;e are the mo&s;t pernicious People in the Univer&s;e. Indeed if I &s;hould tell you all the Tragical Stories which I hear every day, you would grant that this Country is the very Theatre of the mo&s;t horrid Scenes in the World. Love frequently furni&s;hes the matter, either for its Satisfaction or Re|venge. There is nothing that a <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not undertake, nor nothing that is above either his Courage or Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, that <HI>Jealou&s;ie</HI> is their prevailing Pa&s;&s;ion, yet they do not pretend it &s;o much out of Love, as Re&s;entment and Pride; for they cannot bear to &s;ee another prefer'd before them, and every thing which contributes to affront them, makes them de&s;parate; let the&s;e things be how they will, one thing is cer|tainly true, that it is a mo&s;t furious and barbarous Nation in this Affair. The Women keep not company with Men; but yet they very well under&s;tand how to write and appoint Meetings when they have a mind; notwith&s;tanding the danger is great both for them&s;elves, the Lover and the Me&s;&s;enger; but in &s;pite of all that, by their Wit and their Money, they make a &s;hift to deceive the mo&s;t cunning <HI>Argus.</HI></P>

<P>It is unaccountable that Men who put every thing in practice to &s;atisfie their Revengeful Minds, and who are guilty of &s;uch abominable Actions, &s;hould even be &s;crupulou&s;ly <HI>Religious,</HI> at the &s;ame time they are going to &s;tab their Enemy.

I would not be thought to fix this Character upon the whole Nation; it may be affirm'd that there's as good People as in any part of the World, and that they are endow'd with a mighty <HI>Greatne&s;s of Mind.</HI> I'll give you &s;ome In&s;tances of this la&s;t, which perhaps though you'll look upon as Follies, for every thing has two handles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conne&s;table de Ca&s;tille</HI> is for certain, one of the riche&s;t Lords of the Court in Lands; but as he has the &s;ame fault as others like him &s;elf, which is to be carele&s;s in looking after his Intere&s;t, &s;o he is ill furni&s;h'd with Money. The Pen&s;ions which the King allows him, as he is <HI>Doyen</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Coun|cil of State, Conne&s;table of Ca&s;tille,</HI> and <HI>Grand Falconer,</HI> are &s;o con&s;iderable, as to &s;upply all his wants, but he is &s;o haughty, that he will not receive any thing upon that Account. He gives the&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>That when a Subject has E&s;tate enough to live upon, he ought not to be chargeable to his Prince, but ought to &s;erve him, and e&s;teem him&s;elf happy; that to be paid for what he does is mercenary and &s;lavi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>d'Arcas,</HI> alias <HI>d'Avero,</HI> hath likewi&s;e another ob|&s;tinate humour; he pretends that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> has u|&s;urp'd the Crown from his Family, and therefore when he &s;peaks of him, he never calls him any thing, but Duke <HI>de Bra|gance;</HI> in the mean while, this Man has forty thou&s;and Crowns a year in <HI>Portugal,</HI> of which he does not enjoy a farthing, be|cau&s;e he will not &s;ubmit to ki&s;s the King's hand, nor to do him homage.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath &s;ent him word, that he will di&s;|pen&s;e with his coming him&s;elf, provided he will &s;end in his &s;tead one of his Sons, either the elde&s;t or the younge&s;t, which he will, and that he will then let him receive his Rents; and moreover, will pay him all the Arrears, which amount to an immen&s;e Sum. The Duke <HI>d'Avero</HI> will not &s;o much as hear it mention'd: He &s;ays, that &s;eeing he has lo&s;t the Crown, it would be a &s;hame for forty thou&s;and Crowns a year, to &s;ubmit to the U&s;urper; that the greater evil takes away the &s;en&s;e of the le&s;&s;er; that the Glory the King would receive from his Homage, would exceed the profit he gets from his Revenue;
<PB N="212" REF="109"> and that he would have cau&s;e to reproach him, for having done an honour to him which was not his due.</P>
<P>The la&s;t I re&s;erve for you, is the Prince <HI>De&s;tillano;</HI> he hath Places and Commi&s;&s;ions to di&s;po&s;e of at the <HI>Contratraction</HI> in <HI>Sevile,</HI> to the value of four&s;core thou&s;and <HI>Livres</HI> a year. He had rather lo&s;e them, than &s;o much as &s;et his hand to the ne|ce&s;&s;ary di&s;patches, &s;aying, It is not agreeble to the Genero&s;ity of &s;uch a <HI>Cavallero</HI> as he is, to trouble him&s;elf to &s;ign his Name for &s;o &s;mall a matter; for you mu&s;t know, that the&s;e four&s;core thou&s;and <HI>Livers</HI> are not in one Article, it may be there is above thirty; and when his Secretary pre&s;ents to him a di&s;patch or grant of a Place, worth four or five thou&s;and <HI>Livres,</HI> he will refu&s;e to &s;ign it, and alledges his Quality, always &s;aying, <HI>E&s;to es una Mineria,</HI> that is, it is but a Trifle.

<P>You'll &s;ay now, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Fools with this their fanta&s;tick Grandeur; and perhaps you are in the right, but for my part, and I think I know 'em pretty well, I am not of that Opinion; yet neverthele&s;s I'll own, that whatever difference can be found in comparing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> it mu&s;t be to our advantage; but it does not &s;eem fit for me to med|dle in determining the matter, for my Intere&s;t is too much concern'd to let me judge impartially; but yet I am per&s;waded, that there are very few rational Per&s;ons, who would not make the &s;ame Judgment.</P>
<P>There are fewer Strangers that come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> than to any City in the World, and they have rea&s;on; for unle&s;s they have &s;omebody to procure them Lodging in &s;ome private Hou&s;e, they'll run the hazard of being very ill lodg'd, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not very ready to offer their Hou&s;es to any body, becau&s;e of their Wives, of whom they are extream jealous. I do not know, that in all this City, there's any more than two <HI>Inns,</HI> whereof at one of them, they eat after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and when the&s;e are full (which they are very quickly, being very little) one knows not what to do; add to this, That there's no conveniency for pa&s;&s;ing too and fro in the Town, Hackney, or hyr'd Coaches are &s;carce enough, but one may have as many Chairs as one will; yet it is &s;eldom that Men are carry'd in them, unle&s;s they be very old or infirm. But after all, why &s;hould Strangers come to <HI>Madrid?</HI> That which is fine&s;t and the mo&s;t amiable, is always hid, I mean the Women, there's no conver&s;ing with them; tho&s;e Women that may be &s;een, are &s;uch dangerous Creatures for a Man's Health, that it mu&s;t be a
<PB N="213" REF="109"> great Curio&s;ity indeed, that a Man can re&s;olve to &s;atisfie at &s;o much ri&s;que; yet in &s;pight of all this, the only Plea&s;ure, and the &s;ole Enjoyment of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is to contract &s;ome League; even Youths of Quality that are rich, begin at the Age of twelve or thirteen years to entertain a Concubine-Mi|&s;tre&s;s, which they call <HI>Amancebade,</HI> for whom they neglect their Studies, and make away with whatever they can catch up in their Father's Hou&s;e, but 'tis not long before tho&s;e Creatures give them cau&s;e to repent of their Folly.</P>
<P>But that which is terrible is, That there are few Per&s;ons in this Country, either of one or t'other Sex, and even of tho&s;e who&s;e Quality di&s;tingui&s;hes them, that are free from that cur|&s;ed Di&s;ea&s;e; their Children either bring it into the World with them from their Mother's Womb, or &s;uck it from the Nur&s;e; a Virgin may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected to have it, and they are hardly per&s;waded to be cur'd of it, they are &s;o certain of falling again into the &s;ame Condition. But doubtle&s;s this Di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;o dangerous in <HI>Spain</HI> as in other Countries, for they &s;till pre&s;erve their Hair very fine, and their Teeth very good: At <HI>Court,</HI> and among&s;t the Women of the highe&s;t Quality, they di&s;cour&s;e of it as they do of a Fever, or the Meagrim, and they all bear the Di&s;temper patiently, without &s;o much as troubling them&s;elves one minute about it. As they know not but that the mo&s;t ver|tuous Women, and the younge&s;t Child may have it, &s;o they never let blood in the Arm, but always in the Foot; they'll let a Child three Weeks old blood in the Foot, and this is &s;o con|&s;tant a Cu&s;tom among&s;t them, that unle&s;s it be &s;ome very able Surgeon, they know not how to let blood in the Arm. I was indi&s;pos'd, and was forc'd to make u&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor's <HI>valet de Chambre,</HI> to let me blood in the Arm. By all that I have told you, it is ea&s;ie to judge, that this is the <HI>Nup|tial</HI> pre&s;ent which a <HI>Spaniard</HI> makes to his Wife, and that though they marry, they do not quit their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, be they never &s;o dangerous. Every time the&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are let blood, their Gallants are oblig'd to give them a compleat new &s;uit of Apparel; and yet you mu&s;t ob&s;erve they wear ten or twelve Petticoats at a time; &s;o that this cau&s;es no ordinary Expence. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> under&s;tanding that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was ju&s;t let blood, and &s;o could not tarry till the Tailor made her a &s;uit which he intended for her, he &s;ent her one that was ju&s;t brought home for the <HI>Marchione&s;s</HI> his Lady, who is extream beautiful. It is a common &s;aying with him, <HI>That to be the happi|e&s;t Man, he would only wi&s;h a Mi&s;tre&s;s as hand&s;om as his Wife.</HI></P>

<P>The great Lords which return very rich from their Govern|ments (whether for the mo&s;t part they go poor enough, and where they pillage and extort all they can, becau&s;e they are but for five years time) do not lay out their Money when they come home, in the purcha&s;e of Lands; they keep it in their Che&s;ts, and as long as it la&s;ts, they live at a great rate, for they think it is below 'em to improve their Money. Following this Method, it would be very hard for the greate&s;t Trea&s;ure not to be quickly exhau&s;ted; but the future di&s;turbs them but little, for every one of them hopes either for &s;ome <HI>Vice-Royalty,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> which will effectually repair all their ill Husbandry, and re&s;tore them to a good Condition: And it mu&s;t be own'd that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is capable both to &s;atisfie the Ambition of his Subjects, and to reward their Services; and indeed, many of his Subjects fill up the Places of divers <HI>So|vereign Princes,</HI> which were the mo&s;t eminent Men of their Age.</P>
<P>The difference is very remarkable between tho&s;e <HI>Sovereigns</HI> heretofore, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at pre&s;ent; it is le&s;s as to their Birth, than as to their Merit; for the Families of the great Lords are very Illu&s;trious, there's many of them that are de|&s;cended from the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tille, Navarre, Arragon</HI> and <HI>Por|tugal;</HI> but yet this does not hinder &s;everal of them (for I make an exception) from contradicting the vertue of their Ance&s;tors; but then let's &s;ee, how the&s;e are educated: They do not &s;tudy, neither have they any able Ma&s;ters; as &s;oon as they are de&s;ign'd for the Sword, no further care is taken to teach them either Latin or Hi&s;tory; but one would think they &s;hould at lea&s;t be taught what belongs to their Art, &s;uch as the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> to <HI>fence,</HI> and <HI>ride</HI> the Hor&s;e; but they do not &s;o much as think of the&s;e Matters. Here are no <HI>Academies,</HI> nor Ma&s;ters to teach &s;uch things; the young Men pa&s;s that time which they &s;hould employ for their In&s;truction, in a wretched Lazine&s;s, either in walking about, or courting &s;ome Lady; and yet in &s;pight of all this, they are per&s;uaded, that there are not any People in the World which de&s;erve publick Admiration more than they do. They believe <HI>Madrid</HI> to be the very Center of all Glory and Happine&s;s, of all Arts and Sciences, and of all Delights and Plea&s;ures; in dying, they only wi&s;h their Children the enjoy|ment of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Madrid;</HI> by this means you &s;ee they exalt this City above <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> with &s;o much &s;atis|faction do they live in't. And 'tis this which hinders them from vi&s;iting other Courts, and there acquiring that <HI>Politene&s;s</HI> which they have not among&s;t them&s;elves, and to which they are per|fect
<PB N="215" REF="110"> Strangers. And 'tis this al&s;o which makes them &s;o eager to return home to <HI>Madrid,</HI> let them be where they will, whe|ther they be &s;ent by the King, or let them be there in what Rank or Station they will; let them be never &s;o much honour'd, and heap up never &s;o much Wealth, yet the love to their Coun|try, and the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for that, hath &s;uch a power over them, as to make them renounce every thing; and they had rather choo&s;e to lead a mean poor Life, (&s;o it be not ob&s;erv'd) without any Train, Grandeur or Di&s;tinction, provided it be but at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>It is very &s;eldom, that a Father lets his Son travel abroad, but keeps him at home, and &s;uffers him to take up what Cu&s;toms he plea&s;es; you may ea&s;ily believe, that generally the&s;e are none of the be&s;t; for there's a certain Age, when Youth aims at nothing el&s;e, but to gratifie their Appetite, and enjoy Plea&s;ures. One entices and draws another, and that which ought to be &s;everely reprov'd, is authoriz'd by the Example of tho&s;e, on whom they depend. Add to this, That they make them marry, as one may &s;ay, as &s;oon as they are out of the Cradle. At the Age of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years they turn in|to the World a young Man with a Wife that is but a Child, and this at once makes him le&s;s capable to know his Duty, and puts him upon being more debauch'd, becau&s;e he is his own Ma&s;ter under no controul: by this means, he pa&s;&s;es his Life in a Chim|ney-corner, like a Man in his decriped old Age; and becau&s;e this gentle Sluggard is of an Illu&s;trious Family, he mu&s;t be cho|&s;en to govern a People that mu&s;t &s;uffer through his Ignorance; but that which is yet wor&s;e, is, That &s;uch a Man taking him&s;elf for &s;ome great and knowing Per&s;on, acts only by his own head, without con&s;ulting or advi&s;ing with any body, and &s;o does every thing awkwardly and ab&s;urdly. The Wife, it may be, is not better &s;tor'd with Wit and Parts; her mighty greatne&s;s, with which &s;he prides her &s;elf, is the only thing that can make her be regarded; and thus Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Capacity, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to two Animals, which are made their Superiors.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, let us be ju&s;t, and render to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> his due. It mu&s;t be own'd, that when Heaven hath been &s;o kind to a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as to give him a good Education, and let him travel and &s;ee the World, he makes a better improvement than any body. Nature has been kinder to them than they are to them&s;elves; they are born with more Wit than others; they have a great quickne&s;s of Mind joyn'd with great Solidity; they &s;peak and deliver their words with ea&s;e, they have a great Me|mory; their Style is near and conci&s;e, and they are quick of
<PB N="216" REF="111"> Apprehen&s;ion. It is ea&s;ie to teach them whatever they have a mind to; they are perfect Ma&s;ters in Politicks, and when there's a Nece&s;&s;ity for't, they are temperate and laborious. Without que&s;tion, &s;everal great Qualities may be found among&s;t them, &s;uch as Genero&s;ity, Secre&s;ie, Friend&s;hip, Bravery, and in a word, all tho&s;e Endowments of Mind, which go to make up a perfect, good, and vertuous Man. And here methinks, I have a fair opportunity to conclude this Letter, and to beget in you an e&s;teem of the&s;e People. I &s;hould not be &s;orry, if I could procure them this Happine&s;s; for their Manners do not &s;uit &s;o ill with me, as with a great many others, who cry out again&s;t them, and condemn them, before they have either examin'd or known them. For my part, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that there is here, both good and bad, as there is in all other parts of the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>HEre's a general rejoycing, &s;ince the arrival of the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de los Balbaces,</HI> who brought certain News that the mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian King</HI> had granted <HI>Mademoi&s;el</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> He &s;o impatiently expected the&s;e Tydings, that there was hardly an hour pa&s;s'd, that he did not ask if the <HI>Courrier</HI> was not come; and as &s;oon as he knew it, he immediately went to hear <HI>Te Deum</HI> at our Lady <HI>d' Atocha's</HI> Church. As the Ladies do not go thither, &s;o they are to content to dre&s;s them&s;elves very fine, and place them&s;elves in their Windows. I cho&s;e this, and I thought I &s;hould have been both choak'd and blind|ed, it was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive du&s;ty. I &s;aw the King in his Coach of green Oyl-cloth; he had but a &s;mall attendance, for &s;ome twen|ty Halbardiers cloth'd in yellow with tru&s;t Breeches like the Pa|ges, made up his Guard, marching before and behind him. The Courtiers Coaches indeed that accompany'd him, were &s;o numerous that they could hardly be told; the People every where crowding, even to the tops of the Hou&s;es, cry'd out <HI>Viva el Roy, Deos le Bendiga,</HI> and &s;everal added, <HI>Viva el Reina nue&s;tra Seinnora.</HI> There was not the lea&s;t Hou&s;e or Street with|out
<PB N="217" REF="111"> its &s;pread Tables; every body had their Garlick, Leeks and Onions in their hands, in&s;omuch that they perfum'd the Air with them, and they were even debauch'd with drinking their Maje&s;ty's Health in Water: For dear Cou&s;in, though I have al|ready mentioned it to you, yet methinks I may repeat it here, That there never was People &s;o temperate as the&s;e, e&s;pecially in Wine; and they have &s;o &s;trange an abhorrence for tho&s;e that are guilty of Intemperance, that by their Law, a Man that can be prov'd but once to have been drunk, is refus'd for being a Witne&s;s in any Court of Ju&s;tice where he is offer'd, and after a &s;harp reproof is &s;ent away. And if it happen, that one calls another <HI>Boracho,</HI> that is <HI>Drunkard,</HI> this Injury is &s;ure to be re|veng'd with Murther.</P>
<P>That Night the King was at <HI>Antocha;</HI> we illuminated all our Hou&s;es with great Flamboys of white Wax which they call <HI>Ha|chas;</HI> they are longer than tho&s;e that are us'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> to light the Coaches at night, but withal, they are a great deal dearer, not only becau&s;e the Wax is brought at great Charges from o|ther Parts of the World, but al&s;o becau&s;e there is a prodigious quantity of it con&s;um'd in <HI>Spain.</HI> And when they make Illu|minations, they are not contented to &s;et up four or &s;ix Flam|boys, but they mu&s;t put two in every Balcony, and two at each Window up to the highe&s;t Story; there are &s;ome Hou&s;es which thus require four or five hundred. Every where there were Bonefires made, and we went to the Palace to &s;ee a <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> of a hundred and fifty Lords which they &s;aid was to be there. I cannot imagine why they call this Diver&s;ion by that Name, for they were not at all <HI>maskt;</HI> commonly they choo&s;e the darke&s;t Night. All the Courtiers are mounted upon their fine&s;t Hor&s;es, every Hor&s;e was covered with Silver Gauze and Hou|&s;ings embroider'd with Gold and Pearl. The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were cloath'd in Black, with colour'd Taby Sleeves, embroider'd with Silk and Bugles; they wore little Hatts button'd up with Dia|monds, and in them a Plume of Feathers, they had rich Scarfes and many Jewels; but with all this, their Black Cloaks and their ugly Collars &s;trangely disfigure them. They ride a Hor&s;eback like the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> that is, as they call it a <HI>Genita,</HI> their Stirrups are &s;o &s;hort that their knees are even with, and re&s;t upon the Tops of the Hor&s;es &s;houlders. I cannot yet reconcile my Eyes to this Fa&s;hion; they &s;ay, that thus they can better rai&s;e and put them&s;elves forth again&s;t any that a&s;&s;aults them. But to return to the <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> they all met together at an appointed Place, which u&s;ually is at one of the Gates of the City. The Streets through which they were to go, were all &s;trewed
<PB N="218" REF="112"> with Sand, and on each &s;ide there was a kind of Chaffing di&s;hes &s;et upon Poles, which be&s;ide the white Wax Flamboys gave a great Light, there were al&s;o placed &s;everal very clear Lanthorns in Windows, which made a very fine Show. Every <HI>Cavallero</HI> had a great many Footmen, which were cloath'd in Cloath of Gold and Silver; they went by their Ma&s;ters &s;ides with Flamboys. The Ma&s;ters marcht four in a rank very &s;oftly, each holding a Flamboy al&s;o; they went all over the City attended with Trumpets, Timbrels, Bagpipes and Flutes, and when they came to the Palace which was illuminated, and the Court co|vered with Sand, they took &s;everal Turns, and run and pu&s;ht again&s;t one another with a De&s;ign to throw each other down with the&s;e tricks. Prince <HI>Alexander de Parma,</HI> who is of a prodigious bigne&s;s fell down, and the fall of him made as great a noi&s;e as the &s;hooting of a moderate high-hill, they had much ado to carry him off, for he was grievou&s;ly bruis'd with his Fall; there were &s;everal of them with their great Spectacles on, but particularly the Marque&s;s <HI>D' A&s;torgas,</HI> who does not only wear them for gravity &s;ake, but for need, for he is old; but yet for all that, he is frolick&s;om, he will be <HI>Meyor Domo</HI> to the young Queen, and he is a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>And now I &s;peak of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain, Don Fernand de Tolledo,</HI> told me t'other day a thing plea&s;ant enough. His Father in Law, who is the Marque&s;s <HI>De Palacios,</HI> lives at a horrid pro|fu&s;e rate, for it &s;eems he is one of tho&s;e profe&s;t Gallants of the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> and to arrive to that, one mu&s;t both have a great deal of Wit, and &s;hew abundance of Magnificence, I mean a certain peculiar &s;ort of Wit that's neat and refin'd, he mu&s;t have choice Phra&s;es and Expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome ways and modes not common, he mu&s;t under&s;tand how to write both in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, and that too better than another. In a word, one mu&s;t both talk and do in this <HI>Pallace</HI>-Gallantry af|ter quite another rate than is us'd in the City. But to return to the Marque&s;s <HI>De Palacios.</HI> There was a publick Fe&s;tival appointed by the <HI>King,</HI> this Marque&s;s wanted Money to ap|pear there, he is Lord of &s;everal Towns, it came into his head to go down po&s;t to them; a&s;&s;oon as he arriv'd, at the fir&s;t, he caus'd Papers to be &s;et up, That all tho&s;e of that Town which de&s;ir'd to be made <HI>Grandees,</HI> &s;hould immediately come to him. There was not either Ju&s;tice, Burge&s;s or Trade&s;man, which was not pre&s;ently fill'd with vehement Ambitious de|&s;ires for the <HI>Grandeza</HI> his Hou&s;e was crowded with all &s;orts of People, he agreed with them every one &s;everally in private, and got as much as he could of them, and afterwards he made
<PB N="219" REF="112"> them all be covered before him, and gave them Patents in Form ju&s;t as the <HI>King</HI> does, when he makes any one a <HI>Grandee.</HI> His Invention &s;ucceeded two well in the fir&s;t Town, not to practi&s;e it in the re&s;t: He found among&s;t them the &s;ame Di&s;|po&s;ition to give him Money, that through his means they might be <HI>Grandees,</HI> with this trick, he got a con&s;iderable Sum, and away he comes, and makes a &s;plendid Shew at Court. But as a Man is never without Enemies, &s;o there were &s;ome Per|&s;ons that had a mind to make u&s;e of this plea&s;ant Frolick to put him out of the <HI>King</HI>'s Favour. His Maje&s;ty was told of it, and the Marquis ju&s;tified him&s;elf well enough, in &s;aying all tho&s;e to whom he had granted permi&s;&s;ion to be covered before him, being born his Va&s;&s;als, they ow'd more re&s;pect than to dare to take this liberty without his leave, and that therefore he had made them <HI>Grandees,</HI> as to him&s;elf. And after this the thing was only lookt upon as a merry je&s;t.</P>
<P>This <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> comes often to &s;ee us, and as he belong'd to the late Court, &s;o Ye&s;terday he told me, that a famous <HI>A&s;trologer</HI> being one day with the late <HI>King</HI> in the Terra&s;s-walk of the Pallace, the <HI>King</HI> askt him the height of that Place, he gaz'd up into the Air, and nam'd a certain Height. The <HI>King</HI> pri|ately order'd them to rai&s;e the Pavement of the <HI>Terra&s;s</HI> about three or four fingers, and in the Night it was done. The next Morning he caus'd the <HI>A&s;trologer</HI> to come to him, and being up|on the Terra&s;s with him, &s;ays he to him, I &s;poke la&s;t night of the height you told me of this Walk, but there was &s;ome that maintain'd that you were mi&s;taken, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, I dare &s;ay, I was not mi&s;taken; But con&s;ider it well &s;ays the <HI>King,</HI> and af|terwards we'll him a&s;ham'd, which boa&s;ts him&s;elf to be a more knowing Man than you. Immediately he began again to make his Ob&s;ervations, the <HI>King</HI> &s;aw him change colour, and &s;eem to be at a great lo&s;s; but at la&s;t he drew nigh the <HI>King,</HI> and &s;aid, what I told your Maje&s;ty Ye&s;terday was true, but to day I find, that either the Terra&s;s is rais'd, or the Heavens are &s;unk down a little lower. The <HI>King</HI> &s;mil'd, and told him the trick he had put upon him.</P>
<P>That I may give you an Account of other matters, I mu&s;t tell you, that the <HI>King</HI> has in his Family three Per&s;ons which by way of Eminency are call'd, the great Officers, the <HI>Mayor Domo Mayor,</HI> the <HI>Sumiller of the Body,</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e.</HI> The&s;e three Places are thus di&s;tingui&s;ht, the <HI>Mayor Do|mo</HI> commands in the <HI>Pallace,</HI> the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Sumiller</HI> of the Body, is in the <HI>King</HI>'s Chamber, and the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, orders all things in every Place, except the <HI>Pallace.</HI></P>
<PB N="220" REF="113">
<P>After the&s;e come the Gentlemen of the <HI>Kings</HI> Bed-chamber, they wear at their Girdle for a mark of their Dignity, a gold|en Key. There are three &s;orts of the&s;e Keys; the fir&s;t, gives the Employment of the Gentleman of the Bed-chamber; the &s;econd, the Entrance with the Employment; and the third is call'd, <HI>Clavae Capona,</HI> which only gives Entrance into the Anti-chamber. The Number of the&s;e Gentlemen is great, there are Forty of tho&s;e for Service, which take it in turns every day, and for the mo&s;t part they are <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Mayor Domo,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Steward</HI> in Ordinary, have the &s;ame Acce&s;s as the Gentlmen of the Bed-chamber. The Per&s;ons of highe&s;t Quality fill up the&s;e Places, for the mo&s;t part they are the &s;econd Sons of the <HI>Grandees,</HI> they wait in turns every Week, and when the High-Steward is ab&s;ent, they are inve&s;t|ed with his Power, the&s;e al&s;o introduce <HI>Foreign</HI> Mini&s;ters when they have Audience, there are eight of them, &s;ometimes more, but &s;eldom fewer.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> hath three Companies for his Guards, but they have not any thing that agrees with one another. The Mar|que&s;s <HI>De Falces</HI> commands the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Burgundian</HI> Guard, it con&s;i&s;ts of a hundred <HI>Halbardiers,</HI> and although here, they call them the Yeomen of the Guard; yet they may be call'd the Life Guard; the <HI>German</HI> Guard con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame Number, <HI>Don Pedro D' Arragon</HI> is Captain of it, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guard is al&s;o com|pos'd of a hundred Halberdiers, and are commanded by the Count <HI>De los Arcos.</HI> He is likewi&s;e Captain of another Company of a hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> call'd the Guards of the <HI>Lancilla,</HI> and this never appears, but at great Ceremonies, and at the Funerals of Kings. The Affairs of the State are manag'd by a Chief Mini&s;ter which they call <HI>Privado,</HI> he hath under him a Secretary of State, who&s;e Office is in the Pallace. All Bu&s;ine&s;s that come to the <HI>King</HI> and the Mini&s;ter, ought to pa&s;s directly through his hands, and as he di&s;patches al&s;o whatever the <HI>King</HI> orders, &s;o he is call'd <HI>Secretario del de&s;pacho &V;niver&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> of State, and divers other <HI>Councils</HI> examine all matters, and the <HI>King</HI> or the <HI>Chief Mini&s;ter,</HI> afterwards de|termine them, there are a great many Coun&s;ellors: Here fol|low the Names of tho&s;e which at pre&s;ent compo&s;e the Coun|cil of <HI>State, Viz.</HI> The <HI>Con&s;table De Ca&s;tile</HI> of the Family of the <HI>Vale&s;aco's,</HI> is the Pre&s;ident, the Duke <HI>D' Albe,</HI> the Duke <HI>De Medicina Celi, Don Pedro D' Arragon,</HI> the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;t|ile,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>D' A&s;torgas,</HI> the Prince <HI>De Stillano,</HI> the Duke <HI>D' O&s;&s;ona,</HI> the Count <HI>De Chinchon, Don Vincent Gouzaga,</HI> Prince <HI>De Gua&s;talla, Don Lewis Portocarrero</HI> Cardinal Archbi&s;hop of
<PB N="221" REF="113"> <HI>Tolledo,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>De Liches,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>De los Balbares Don Diego Sarmituto, Don Melchios Navarra,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>De Lo&s;veler,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>De Man&s;era,</HI> and the Duke <HI>D' Albur|querque.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides This Council, which is the principal, there is that of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition of War,</HI> of the Orders of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of the <HI>In|dies,</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Hazienda,</HI> of the <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> and of <HI>Flanders,</HI> there is al&s;o the Chamber of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> of the <HI>Alcaides de Corta,</HI> of the <HI>Contaduria, D' Apo&s;ento, Delos Bo&s;ques Reales, De Mil|liones,</HI> and <HI>De Competancias.</HI> But do not think, dear Kin&s;wo|man, that the Salleries and Profits of tho&s;e Places are &s;mall. For in&s;tance, The Coun&s;ellors of the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> make from eighteen to twenty thou&s;and Crowns a Year of their Places. And here 'tis pertinent to tell you, that 'tis thought no Places are &s;old in this Countrey, at lea&s;t it is not known; in in all appearace they are be&s;tow'd upon Merit or Birth, but yet underhand, there are &s;uch con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents made, that to get a <HI>Vice Royalty,</HI> they'll give Five thou&s;and Pi&s;tols, and &s;ometimes more. That which would be call'd <HI>Buying</HI> in ano|ther Countrey, at <HI>Madrid</HI> is term'd giving a <HI>Regalio,</HI> that is, making a Pre&s;ent, and one is equivalent to the other, with this difference, that a Place, or a Government which one <HI>buys,</HI> is yours as long as you live, and &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es by Inheritance to your Children, either by natural Right, or the Conce&s;&s;ion of the Prince; but in <HI>Spain,</HI> they enjoy a Place which co&s;t them very dear, only three or five Years at mo&s;t. It is ea&s;ie to believe that tho&s;e who advance &s;o much, are very certain to reimbur&s;e them&s;elves both Principal and Intere&s;t. From this Practice the People are horribly oppre&s;t, they have perpe|tually upon them, either a new <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> or Governour, which comes from draining him&s;elf of all the ready-Money which he could either make of his own and &s;ometimes of his Friends, to bribe the <HI>Court.</HI> Thus he comes hungry, and he has but a &s;hort time to enrich him&s;elf, and &s;o the poor People are on all hands pillaged, without &s;o much as being able to have their Com|plaints heard. But it is yet quite another thing in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where Gold is &s;o plentiful, and they are &s;o far from the <HI>King</HI> and his Mini&s;ters. It is certain they bring from thence im|men&s;e Sums, as I think, I have already intimated to you, even the <HI>Religious</HI> as they call them, who are &s;ent to preach there, return not without forty and fifty thou&s;and Crowns, which they have heap'd up in four or five Years time; &s;o notwith|&s;tanding their <HI>Vow of Poverty,</HI> they find out the &s;ecret of grow|ing rich; and during their Life they are &s;uffer'd to enjoy the Fruit of their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<PB N="222" REF="114">
<P>The <HI>Mona&s;teries</HI> here, have yet another piece of Craft, which commonly &s;ucceeds, when a <HI>Religieus</HI> Per&s;on or <HI>Fryer</HI> happens to be the only Son. If his Father is rich, they beg him to leave his E&s;tate to the <HI>Convent,</HI> where his Son has ta|ken the Habit, upon condition that he &s;hall manage and en|joy it whil&s;t he lives, but after his Death that the <HI>Mona&s;tery</HI> &s;hall inherit it, and put up Prayers and &s;ay <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> for the Fa|ther and the Son. By this means there are profes'd <HI>Fryars</HI> which have ten thou&s;and Crowns a Year, at their di&s;po&s;al. This Affluence in a Countrey where Rea&s;on has put little pow|er over the Affections, does not always make them more ho|ly; and if there are any that u&s;e it well, there are abundance which abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>It is known, that every year there comes from the <HI>Indies,</HI> above five and thirty Millions of Crowns, but yet not a quarter part of this ever goes into the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Coffers. The&s;e Trea&s;ures &s;pread them&s;elves over all <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>French, Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> draw away the be&s;t &s;hares of it. Methinks, this does not &s;uit with the refin'd Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to wa&s;te their own Subjects in digging Gold out of the Mines, to let other Nations, with whom they are often at War, reap the Profit; but the natural Lazine&s;s which hin|ders them from working, and to have at home Manufactures of their of their own, obliges them to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e, who can furni&s;h their Countrey with the Merchandizes they want.</P>
<P>As Strangers dare not venture to go there, becau&s;e it is upon no le&s;s penalty than hanging, &s;o they contrive to &s;end their effects in the Names of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants, with whom they meet with all the Fidelity imaginable; and if the <HI>King</HI> would, he could not hinder Strangers from receiving what is properly theirs; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, had rather loo&s;e their Lives, than any wrong &s;hould come to ano|ther. There's one thing remarkable, and that is, when the <HI>Flota</HI> comes to an Anchor at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there are Men who make publick profe&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t in cheating the <HI>King</HI> of his Cu&s;toms upon Silver and other Merchandizes. It is as much their Trade and Livelyhood, as for a Banker to deal in Money. They call them <HI>Metadors;</HI> and as much Knaves as they are towards the <HI>King,</HI> yet one mu&s;t do them the right to &s;ay, they are not &s;o to the private men which agree with them for a certain reward &s;ecurely to lodge their Silver in &s;uch a place of the City as they &s;hall de&s;ire. And this practice is &s;o certain and &s;afe, that one never hears of any that have violated their Tru&s;t: It

There might al&s;o be an ea&s;ie remedy found out to hinder the <HI>King</HI> from lo&s;ing all upon this occa&s;ion; and that is, to abate the Duties a little, which indeed are very high, and &s;o what is given to the&s;e <HI>Me|tadors,</HI> and &s;omewhat more, might be paid to the <HI>Cotratacti|on,</HI> for naturally the Merchants do not love cheating, and are continually afraid of paying at once, what they have been &s;a|ving for half a &s;core Voyages; but 'tis the humour of the <HI>Spaniards, To have all or nothing,</HI> and very often they have <HI>no|thing.</HI> As to <HI>Madrid,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to find there any great|er Robbers and Cheats than the Magi&s;trates and Officers them|&s;elves; the&s;e are the Men, that with Impunity appropriate to them&s;elves the <HI>Kings</HI> Cu&s;toms, and who cheat him after &s;uch a rate, that 'tis no wonder if he &s;o often wants Money: but they are not &s;atisfied with cheating their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> they mu&s;t al&s;o abu&s;e and pillage the <HI>People;</HI> and although the Laws of this Nation are not only very ju&s;t, but equitable, yet no body &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible of them: Tho&s;e very Per&s;ons into who&s;e Hands they are put, and who are &s;et on purpo&s;e to execute them, are the fir&s;t that break and corrupt them.</P>
<P>If you'll but give Money to an <HI>Alcalde,</HI> or to an <HI>Alguazil,</HI> you may have the mo&s;t innocent Per&s;on in the World arre&s;ted or &s;eized, and then thrown into &s;ome na&s;ty dark hole of a Pri&s;on, and there peri&s;h with hunger, without any proceeding or coming to a Tryal, and wthout any Order or Degree; and when the poor wretch is let out of Pri&s;on, he mu&s;t not &s;o much as think of doing him&s;elf right again&s;t this wicked Officer of Ju&s;tice.

<P>Thieves, Murderers, Poy&s;oners, and the greate&s;t Criminals imaginable, remain &s;afe and quiet at <HI>Madrid,</HI> provided they are not rich, for if they be, they are &s;ure to be di&s;turb'd for the &s;ake of that.</P>
<P>They do not judge <HI>Criminal</HI> Matters above twice or thrice a year; it is with the greate&s;t difficulty that they bring them|&s;elves to cau&s;e any Criminal to dye, who is, &s;ay they, a man like them, their Country-man, and the <HI>King</HI>'s Subject; they &s;end mo&s;t either to the Mines, or to the Gallies, and when a|ny

<P>I have already hinted to you, dear Cou&s;in, that in every thing they exactly follow the <HI>Politicks</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> V. without con&s;idering that the difference of times makes a mighty altera|tion in the Events of things, although they may &s;eem to be alike, and in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances; and that what with|out the imputation of ra&s;hne&s;s might have been undertaken 120 years ago under a flouri&s;hing Reign, would be impudent to practi&s;e now under a Reign that is far le&s;s &s;o: but a vanity that is natural to them, hinders them from &s;eeing, that <HI>Pro|vidence</HI> &s;ometimes permits <HI>Empires,</HI> as well as particular <HI>Fami|lies,</HI> to have their Revolutions and Periods.

<P>But not to make any farther Reflexions, which perhaps are too &s;erious and high for me, I will tell you, that here's a ge|neral rejoycing at <HI>Madrid</HI> for the arrival of the <HI>Flota</HI> from the <HI>Indies.</HI> As 'tis not their humour here to trea&s;ure up Wealth, &s;o this prodigious quantity of Silver, which comes all at a lump, is &s;pread over all the World. One would think that the&s;e immen&s;e Summs co&s;t nothing, and that it is Money which chance &s;ent them. Hereupon the great <HI>Lords</HI> &s;ummon
<PB N="225" REF="115"> their Creditors, and pay them with a profu&s;ene&s;s, which yet without lying, has &s;omething in't that is both noble and very generous; for there are but few Countries where Liberality is &s;o natural, as 'tis in this; and I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that they are patient even to admiration. They have been known to endure mo&s;t long and toil&s;ome <HI>Sieges,</HI> in which be&s;ides the Fatigues of War, they had nothing to &s;upport them but Bread made of rotten Corn, and &s;tinking Water for their Drink; and yet there are no Men in the World more nice about good Water. I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding all this, and that they have been ex|pos'd to the Severities of the Weather, were half naked, and had hard Lodging, yet in &s;pight of all the&s;e things, they have been found more brave and couragious, than when they en|joy'd Plenty and Pro&s;perity. It is true, that that Temperance which is &s;o natural to them, is a mighty help to them to en|dure hunger when they are forc'd to it; they eat very little, and &s;carcely will they drink any Wine. The Cu&s;tom they have of eating all alone, contributes &s;omething to make them &s;o fru|gal; for indeed, neither their Wives, nor their Children, ever eat with them. The Ma&s;ter has his Table to him&s;elf, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s with her Children &s;it on the Floor upon a Carpet, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> way. They &s;eldom or never invite their Friends to fea&s;t together, &s;o that they are not guilty of a|ny exce&s;s. Upon this account, it is their &s;aying, <HI>That they only eat to live,</HI> whereas there are People, <HI>which only live to eat.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, there are &s;ome rational People, which find this affectation too great; and as they admit of little familiarity in Conver&s;ation, &s;o they perpetually live at a di&s;tance, and as 'twere in Ceremony with one another, without enjoying that freedom which makes that true Union, and produces that de|&s;irable openne&s;s of Heart.</P>
<P>This great Retirement gives them up to a thou&s;and Illu&s;ions, which they call <HI>Philo&s;ophy;</HI> it makes them &s;ingular, dull, fan|ta&s;tick, melancholy and jealous; whereas if they govern'd them|&s;elves otherwi&s;e, there's nothing they would not be capable of, &s;ince they have a wonderful vigour of Mind, an excellent Memory, good Sen&s;e, a &s;olid Judgment, and great Patience; than which, there needs no more to make a Man wi&s;e, to grow in Perfection, to be agreeable in Conver&s;ation, and to di&s;tin|gui&s;h him&s;elf from the mo&s;t polite Nation. But they are &s;o far from being what naturally they might be, though at never &s;o little pains, that they affect a certain Indolency which they call greatne&s;s of Mind; they neglect their mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s, and the advancement of their Fortunes. Provi&s;ion for the fu|ture,
<PB N="226" REF="116"> gives them not the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; the only matter they are not indifferent in, is Jealou&s;ie; they improve that to the utmo&s;t, the bare &s;u&s;picion is enough to make them &s;tab their Wife or their Mi&s;tre&s;s. Their Pa&s;&s;ion of Love is always furious, and yet the Women plea&s;e them&s;elves in it; they &s;ay, they would not for all the mi&s;chief that may befall them, have them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of their unfaithfulne&s;s; that their de&s;perate Temper is a certain proof of a true Pa&s;&s;ion, and that they them&s;elves are not more moderate when they are in Love. They leave nothing unattempted to be reveng'd of tho&s;e they love, if they for&s;ake them without cau&s;e; &s;o that the&s;e &s;ort of amorous Engagements have commonly a fatal end. For in|&s;tance, not long &s;ince, a Woman of Quality, who had cau&s;e to complain of her Gallant, contriv'd to get him into a Hou&s;e where &s;he commanded, and after &s;he had &s;ufficiently reproach'd him, again&s;t which he did but weakly defend him&s;elf, for he was guilty; &s;he pre&s;ented to him a Ponyard, and a Cup of poy|&s;on'd Chocolate, leaving him only the liberty which &s;ort of Death he would choo&s;e: He did not wa&s;te one minute to move her pitty, he very well &s;aw, that in this Place &s;he was the &s;tronge&s;t, &s;o that he tamely drank off the Chocolate without leaving a drop. After he had drunk it, &s;ays he to her, it had been better if you had put a little more Sugar in't, for the Poy|&s;on made it very bitter; remember to do &s;o the next time you prepare another. He was immediately &s;eiz'd with Convul|&s;ions; it was very violent Poy&s;on, and kill'd him in an hours time; and for all this Lady &s;till lov'd him pa&s;&s;ionately, yet &s;he had the barbarity not to &s;tir from him till he was dead.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who is a very well accompli&s;h'd Man, being lately at home, they brought him word, that a Lady cover'd with a Mantle de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him, and that &s;he hid her &s;elf &s;o clo&s;e, they could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee what &s;he was; &s;he had with her two Gentlemen U&s;hers, and a con&s;ide|rable Attendance. He invited her to his Chamber of <HI>Audience,</HI> and &s;he de&s;ir'd he would cau&s;e every body to go out. When &s;he was alone with him, &s;he unveil'd her &s;elf, and appear'd to him extream hand&s;om. <HI>I am of an Illu&s;trious Family,</HI> &s;ays &s;he to him, <HI>my Name is</HI> Donna Blanca de Gu&s;man; <HI>I have de&s;pis'd all the Laws of Decency, in Favour of that Pa&s;&s;ion I have for you; I came to declare it to you, my Lord, and to tell you, that I mu&s;t needs remain here this Night.</HI> From &s;uch an impudent Speech, the Amba&s;&s;ador could not in the lea&s;t doubt, that this was &s;ome Tilt that had borrow'd a great Name, to draw him into &s;ome Snare: but yet with abundance of kindne&s;s, he told her, that

Immediately &s;he was like a Fury, and after &s;he had revil'd and reproach'd him, &s;he drew out a <HI>Stilletto,</HI> and run upon him to have &s;tab'd him. He ea&s;ily prevented her, and having call'd one of his Gentlemen, bid him give five or &s;ix Pi&s;tols to this Woman. She &s;o little de|&s;erv'd this Genero&s;ity, and it &s;o appeas'd her, that &s;he really told him, &s;he was one of tho&s;e Creatures he took her for, and that the rea&s;on why &s;he had been &s;o de&s;perate, was, that the Gentlemen U&s;hers, who waited for her below, were her Gal|lants, and would have broke her bones if &s;he had made no ad|vantage of the Plot they had laid; and that be&s;ides, &s;he was to pay for the Equipage &s;he came in, which was hir'd purpo&s;ely for this de&s;ign, and that &s;he had much rather have dy'd, than to have endur'd all tho&s;e Abu&s;es. The Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o taken with her plea&s;ant Confe&s;&s;ion, that he caus'd ten Pi&s;tols more to be given her; for, &s;ays he to her, &s;ince &s;o many hone&s;t Folks mu&s;t &s;hare with you, your part will be too &s;mall. She &s;ucceeded &s;o well here, that &s;he went directly to the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors; but &s;he was not &s;o courteou&s;ly receiv'd there: For upon the fir&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of her De&s;ign, &s;he and her Attendance e&s;capt very narrowly of being entertain'd with the Strapado.

<P>This Morning we tarried a while in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> for an An&s;wer of a Me&s;&s;age my Kin&s;woman had &s;ent to a Gentleman that dwelt there. In this Place Fi&s;h is &s;old, and there was a Woman which had &s;ome little bits of Salmon to &s;ell, which &s;he &s;aid was fre&s;h; &s;he made a horrid noi&s;e in crying it, and in calling Cu&s;tomers to buy it, at la&s;t comes a Shooemaker, which I knew for &s;uch, becau&s;e &s;he call'd him <HI>Sinior Capatcro;</HI> he ask her for a Pound of her Salmon (and by the way, you mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that every thing here is bought by the pound, even Wood and Charcoal) &s;ays &s;he to him, You do not enquire after the price, becau&s;e you think 'tis cheap, but do not deceive your &s;elf, I a&s;&s;ure you, I mu&s;t have a Crown for every pound. The Shoomaker vext that &s;he que&s;tioned his thoughts and ability, with an angry tone &s;aid to her, <HI>had it been very cheap, I would have had but one pound, but &s;ince 'tis dear, I'll have three,</HI> and im|mediately
<PB N="228" REF="117"> he gives her three Crowns, and then thru&s;ting down his little Hat (for you mu&s;t know that the Trade&s;men wear them as narrow as the People of Quality wear them broad, and turning up his <HI>Mu&s;tachios</HI> by way of Rodamentade, he rais'd the point of his formidable Sword almo&s;t to the top of his &s;houl|der, and haughtily lookt at us, having well ob&s;erv'd that we took notice of him and overheard his Di&s;cour&s;e and were Stran|gers; but the plea&s;antne&s;s of the thing lies here, perhaps the&s;e three Crowns was all that ever this vain-glorious Fool had in the World, that this was his whole Weeks profit, and that to morrow, him&s;elf, his Wife and poor Children, would have a more &s;evere Fa&s;t, than with Bread and Water; but &s;uch is the vain humour of the&s;e People here; nay there are &s;ome of them which will take the legs of a Capon, and will let them hang down under their Cloaks, that they may look as if they really had a Capon, whil&s;t they have nothing but the Legs and Feet.</P>
<P>You cannot &s;ee a Joyner, a Sadler, or other &s;ort of Shop|keeper, without his Velvet and Sattin Suit like the Kings, with his long Rapier and Dagger, and his Guattar hung up in his Shop. They work as little as ever they can, for I have more than once told you, that they are naturally lazy. Indeed no|thing but <HI>over-ruling Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> drives them to do any thing at all, and then they work upon Sundays and other Fe&s;tivals, without any &s;cruple, as well as upon any other Day; and afterwards they carry their Goods abroad. If 'tis a Shoomaker and he has two Prentices, he takes them both with him, and each of them carry a Shooe, nay if he has three, they mu&s;t all go along with him, and 'tis with much ado, that he'll &s;toop to try the Shooes he made; when he has done, he goes and &s;its him down in the Sun (which is call'd the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Fire) with a Company of &s;uch idle Fellows as him&s;elf, and there with a &s;overeign Authority they determine matters of State, and &s;ettle the Intere&s;t of Prin|ces; very often they fall out about them, &s;ome one of them that takes him&s;elf to be a more able Politician than the re&s;t, will have them yield to his Judgment, but another as conceited as him&s;elf will not &s;ubmit, and &s;o they fall together by the Ears without Mercy. I was two days ago to &s;ee the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;|&s;ador's Lady, and there was brought in thither a poor Wretch which was ju&s;t then wounded in the Street; he was a Co&s;ter|monger, and it &s;eems had maintain'd that the <HI>Grand Senior</HI> would not be reckoned a cunning Politician if he did not cau&s;e his Brother to be &s;trangled; another to whom that young Prince was not &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing, &s;tood up in his defence, and thereupon the&s;e two fell a fighting; but after all, to give them their due,
<PB N="229" REF="117"> all the&s;e People talk of Government and Politicks with a great deal of Judgment, and give good Rea&s;ons for what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>Here is in this City &s;everal Hou&s;es which are a &s;ort of Acade|mies, where People meets &s;ome to Play, and others for Conver|&s;ation. They play there with great hone&s;ty, and let them lo&s;e what Sum they will upon Honour, they never fail to pay it in twenty four hours. If there &s;hould be any failure, their Ho|nour and Reputation is for ever lo&s;t. No Rea&s;on what&s;oever will be admitted again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of paying in that time. They play there very high and very fairly, without noi&s;e or &s;hewing the lea&s;t vexation or concern: If they win, it is the Cu|&s;tom to give the <HI>Barato;</HI> this I think is al&s;o us'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> that is to &s;ay, you give Money to tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent, to &s;ome more to others le&s;s, and this whether you know them or no. He to whom you pre&s;ent the <HI>Barato</HI> mu&s;t never refu&s;e it, let him be a hundred times richer and better Quality than the Donour, nay one may demand it of a Game&s;ter that is winning, and he'll not deny to give it. There are People that have no other Sub&s;i&s;tance than this; but yet this is no good Cu&s;tom, for though a Man does win, yet &s;ometimes he hardly carries any thing of his gains away with him, and if he begins to play again, he often lo&s;es his own.</P>
<P>Further, if a Man is found to have cheated, he has as good be|times to for&s;ake all Company; for no hone&s;t Per&s;on will have any thing to do with him, and if he is taken in the fact, he may think him&s;elf happy if he comes off with &s;ome <HI>Cuchillades,</HI> that is, &s;ome Cuts, but not Thru&s;ts with a Sword.</P>
<P>As to the Conver&s;ation in the&s;e Academies, there's of it that is very ingenious, and very knowing Per&s;ons that frequent them; for in a word, they are here ju&s;t as in other Places, and there are &s;ome that write very fine things. What they call <HI>Novels</HI> &s;eem to me to be of a Stile, and to have an Air that charms; they never advance any thing but what's probable, and the Sub|jects they take is &s;o well manag'd, and their Narration &s;o con|ci&s;e and plain, neither mean nor lofty, that one mu&s;t needs grant they have a Genius, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es all others, in the&s;e &s;ort of pieces. I will endeavour to get &s;ome of this kind, and will tran&s;late and &s;end them to you, that &s;o you may judge of them your &s;elf. As I have not capacity enough to &s;peak of things which treat of more &s;ublime matters, &s;o &s;hall I &s;ay no|thing of them till I have been inform'd by tho&s;e that are com|petent Judges, and then I &s;hall only pretend to be their Eccho.

<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you one thing, and 'tis very material, and that is the Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which per&s;wades them rather to be at the charge of a hundred fal&s;e Informations, than to neglect the Opportunity of receiving one true Advice: nei|ther the di&s;tance of the Country from whence they come, nor their Agents, are &s;u&s;pected by them, they will know every thing and liberally recompen&s;e tho&s;e that &s;erve them, nay they'll hardly tarry till the Service is accepted, before they will reward them. You cannot believe how much advantage this Maxim has gain'd them, they have been &s;ometimes taken for Fools, but that has not di&s;|couraged them, and in the end they always had what they in|tended. It is likewi&s;e true, that though they have but very &s;lender ground to beg a favour of the King, yet provided they are not di&s;heartned with Repul&s;es, but pur&s;ue their fir&s;t De&s;ign with Per&s;everance, &s;ooner or later they obtain what they wi&s;ht for. The Mini&s;ters of State think 'tis not &s;uitable to the Grandeur of &s;o mighty a Monarch to refu&s;e a &s;mall matter; and tho there's but little Ju&s;tice in pretending to a favour which one has not de|&s;erved by &s;ome Service, yet if it is &s;ued for without intermi&s;&s;ion, it is always obtain'd. I &s;ee Examples of it every day.</P>
<P>I have not yet told you, dear Cou&s;in, that upon my Arrival here, all the Ladies did me the Honour to vi&s;it me fir&s;t. It is the Cu&s;tom here to prevent Strangers, when once they know they are of Quality and their good Conduct, concerning both which they are very nice. When I return'd them their Vi&s;it, every one made me a Pre&s;ent; &s;ometimes in one Hou&s;e I re|ceiv'd a Dozen, for even the Children of four Years old will treat you. I was pre&s;ented with great Baskets of gilt Silver, a|dorn'd with Corral curiou&s;ly wrought in Flowers; the&s;e are made at <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Millan:</HI> I had al&s;o Amber Boxes &s;et with Gold, ennammell'd and full of Pa&s;tils; divers pre&s;ented me with Gloves and with Silk-Stockings and Garters in abundance; but the&s;e Gloves are &s;ingular, in that they are as &s;hort as the
<PB N="231" REF="118"> Mens, for the Women wear their Sleeves down to their Wri&s;ts, the Fingers are &s;o long that they look as if they were nothing el&s;e, and are ridiculous: The Stockings are made of <HI>Polo,</HI> that is raw Silk; they are made &s;o &s;hort and &s;o little in the Foot, that I have &s;een &s;everal Babies that they would not fit; the Garters are of a broad Ribbond, made very light and thin, like tho&s;e our <HI>Pea&s;ants</HI> give at their Weddings; they are trim'd at each end with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Thread Lace. They pre&s;ented me al&s;o with &s;everal Cups of that Mineral Earth, and a thou&s;and other things of this kind. If ever I go from hence, and make another Journey hither, it will be my turn to pre&s;ent: But ala&s;s! any thing plea&s;es them, Needles, Pins, a little Ribbond, but above all, any thing made of their fal&s;e Stones ravi&s;hes them with Joy; they that have &s;o many that are right and &s;o excel|lent, yet wear a prodigious quantity of the&s;e fal&s;e ones, which in reality are nothing neither, but bitts of Gla&s;s &s;ett, and ju&s;t like tho&s;e our Chimney-&s;weepers &s;ell to our <HI>Provincials,</HI> who never &s;aw more than their <HI>Curate</HI> and their Flock. The Ladies of the greate&s;t Quality are loaded with the&s;e fal&s;e Stones, which they buy at dear rates; and when I askt them why they were &s;o fond of the&s;e conterfeit Diamonds, they told me it was becau&s;e they could have of them as big as they de&s;ir'd. And indeed they have of them in their Pendants, as big as an Egg, and all the&s;e come to them either from <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> for as I have told you, few things are made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> Idlene&s;s reigns too much there.</P>
<P>There's no good Painters in this City, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that draw, are not of this Country; they are either <HI>Flem|mings, Italians</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> which come and &s;ettle here; but yet they do not grow rich, for Money does not come and move in the circle of Trade. For my part, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I never &s;aw le&s;s &s;tirring. My Kin&s;woman receives pretty con&s;iderable Sums all in <HI>Quartos;</HI> it is <HI>Copper</HI> Money, and as na&s;ty as our <HI>Doubles;</HI> but as bad as 'tis, yet it com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of the <HI>Royal</HI> Trea|&s;ure; it is deliver'd by Weight (for how is't po&s;&s;ible to count &s;uch &s;orry &s;tuff?) and Men bring it upon their backs in great matted Baskets; when the&s;e &s;ort of Payments come, the whole Hou&s;e is employ'd for eight days together in taking an Account of the&s;e <HI>Quartos,</HI> in three or four thou&s;and Crowns, there's not a hundred Pi&s;tols, either in Gold or Silver.</P>
<P>They have here great numbers of Slaves, which are bought and &s;old at great rates, the&s;e are <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks;</HI> there are &s;ome of them worth four or five hundred Crowns; heretofore they had power of Life and Death over them, a <HI>Patron</HI> might
<PB N="232" REF="119"> have killed his Slave as he might have kill'd a Dog; but it was thought that the&s;e Barbarities did not agree with the Maxims of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and now that Practice is forbid; but yet they beat them till they cripple them, without ever being call'd to account for't. It's true, there are but few Ma&s;ters that are thus &s;evere; and if a Man happen to love his female Slave, and &s;he grants his de&s;ires, &s;he becomes immediately free. As to the other Dome&s;ticks, it would be &s;omewhat dangerous to u&s;e them ill; they pretend for the mo&s;t part, to be of as good Families as the Ma&s;ters they &s;erve; and if they &s;hould be a|bus'd, they would be in a capacity to revenge them&s;elves, either by Treacherou&s;ly Murdering, or Poy&s;oning of them; there are many Examples of this, they &s;ay, that a Man ought not to in|&s;ult over them, becau&s;e they are poor, that though they are reduced to &s;erve, yet they have not renounc'd their Honour; and that they &s;hould forfeit it, if they &s;hould take blows from any body whatever.</P>
<P>The Beggars are even proud, and when they ask an Alms, it is in an imperious and domineering way; if one refu&s;es them, it mu&s;t be done civilly, in &s;aying to them, <HI>Cavallero, Per|done, u&s;ted, no tenga moneda;</HI> that is, Pardon me <HI>Cavallero,</HI> I have no Money. If you give them a rough Denial, they'll be|gin to argue with you, and undertake to prove to you, that that you do not de&s;erve that E&s;tate God has ble&s;t you with, and will never let you alone; but if one &s;peaks courteou&s;ly to them, they &s;eem well enough content and de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally gentle and kind; they marry their Slaves, and if it be with another Slave, the Children they have are not free, but like their Fathers, are &s;ubject to the <HI>Pa|tron;</HI> but if the&s;e Children marry, their I&s;&s;ue &s;hall not be Slaves. And &s;o it is, if a Woman Slave marry a Free-man, their Chil|dren follow the Condition of the Father. One is mighty well &s;erv'd by the&s;e unhappy Wretches; they are far more diligent, laborious and humble than other Servants; there are few of them that will change their Religion. I have one that is not above nine years old; &s;he is as black as Jett, and would be reckon'd in her own Country a wonderful Beauty, for her No&s;e is quite flat, her Lips prodigiou&s;ly thick, her Eyes of a white and red colour, and her Teeth admirable, in <HI>Europe</HI> as well as in <HI>Africa.</HI> She under&s;tands not a word of any other Language than her own; her Name is <HI>Zayde,</HI> we have got her baptized; this young Chri&s;tian has been &s;o us'd to throw off her white Mantle, and to be quite naked when &s;he was expos'd to &s;ale, that I have had much ado to hinder her from doing &s;o now;
<PB N="233" REF="119"> and t'other day, when we had a great deal of Company, I &s;ent for her; and truly Mrs. <HI>Zayde</HI> was pleas'd to appear before them all with her little black Body as naked as &s;he was born. I am re&s;olved to have her whipt, to make her know that this &s;ort of fa&s;hion does not plea&s;e me, for there is no other way to make her under&s;tand. Tho&s;e that &s;old her to me, told me &s;he was a Girl of <HI>Quality,</HI> and the poor Child will come often and fall down on her Knees before me, hold her hands together, cry, and point towards her Country; I would willingly &s;end her thither, if &s;he could there be a Chri&s;tian; but this impo&s;&s;ibility obliges me to keep her. I would fain under&s;tand her, for I be|lieve &s;he is witty, all her Actions &s;hew it; &s;he dances after her fa&s;hion, and 'tis &s;o plea&s;antly, that &s;he makes us very merry. I make her wear white Patches, with which &s;he is mightily taken. She is dre&s;t as they are at <HI>Moroco,</HI> that is, with a &s;hort Gown almo&s;t without any plights, great Shift-&s;leeves of fine Cloth, &s;trip'd with different colours, like tho&s;e of our <HI>Bohemians</HI> or <HI>Gyp&s;ies;</HI> a pair of Stays which are only made of a &s;lip of Crim|&s;on Velvet with a gold ground, and are made fa&s;t at the &s;ides with &s;ilver Buckles and Buttons, and a Mantle of very fine white woollen &s;tuff, very large and long, in which &s;he wraps her &s;elf, and with one corner of it covers her Head. This dre&s;s is hand&s;ome enough; her &s;hort Hair, which looks like Wool, is cut in &s;everal places, on each &s;ide like a Half-moon, on the the Crown a Circle, and before a Heart; &s;he co&s;t me twenty <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> my Daughter hath made her Governe&s;s of her <HI>Marmo|&s;ett;</HI> it is the little Monkey which the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> pre&s;ented to her. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that <HI>Zayde</HI> and the <HI>Marmo|&s;ett</HI> are well met, and under&s;tand one another very well.</P>
<P>But to come to other things, here's arriv'd a Man which has been fetch'd from the farthe&s;t parts of <HI>Galicia;</HI> he is &s;uch a Saint, that he has done many Miracles, as 'tis pretended. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> heretofore Governe&s;s of the King, was like to dye, and &s;he &s;ent to have him come in all ha&s;te, but they were &s;o long upon the Journey, that &s;he was well again before he came. It was known what day he would arrive, and while &s;he was then expecting him, <HI>Don Fernand de Tolleda,</HI> who is her Nephew, and had not &s;een her &s;ince his return from <HI>Flanders,</HI> becau&s;e of her having been &s;ick; knowing that &s;he was then much better, happen'd to go to her Hou&s;e much about the time the Saint of <HI>Galitia</HI> was to be there. The Marchione&s;s's People &s;eeing him, and not knowing him at all, (for he had been ab&s;ent &s;everal years) without con&s;idering that there were few Men of his Age and Looks &s;o happy as to work Miracles,
<PB N="234" REF="120"> concluded, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that he was the Saint: immediately they threw open the great door, and rung the Bell for the &s;ig|nal, as the Marchione&s;s had order'd them; all the <HI>Duennas</HI> and the Maids came to receive him with every one a Wax-Candle in her hand; &s;everal of them fell upon their Knees, and would not let him &s;tir till he had given them his ble&s;&s;ing. He thought they made a fool of him, to give him &s;uch a reception; he knew not whether he was bewitch'd, or whether he dreamt; and do what he could, he could not per&s;wade him&s;elf that all this was real; it was to no purpo&s;e to talk to them, they mind|ed him not at all, the noi&s;e and the crowd was &s;o great; they brought their Beads to touch him, and tho&s;e that were far off him, threw them at his Head, with a hundred Medals fa&s;ten'd to them. The mo&s;t zealous began to cut his Cloak and his Cloaths; and now his fear began to be very great, le&s;t through a de&s;ire to multiply his <HI>Relicks,</HI> they did not cut him to pieces. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Veloz,</HI> who was carried between four in a great Elbow-Chair, came to meet the Holy Man: and truly when &s;he perceiv'd the mi&s;take, and &s;aw it was her Nephew, &s;he fell a laughing &s;o loud and &s;o long, that &s;he far exceeded the &s;trength every body thought &s;he had. When he came from her Hou&s;e, he came to &s;ee us, all torn, and ju&s;t as the devout People had left him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you, that all is mighty private and retir'd in this Court; but here's the way and manner how &s;ome particular Per&s;ons live: In the Morning as &s;oon as they are up, they drink Water cool'd with Ice, and pre&s;ently after Chocolate; when Dinner-time is come, the Ma&s;ter &s;its down to Table, his Wife and Children, as I have already ob&s;erv'd, eat upon the Floor near the Table; this is not done out of re&s;pect, as they tell me, but the Woman cannot &s;it upon a Chair, &s;he is not accu&s;tomed to it; and there are &s;everal ancient <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wo|men which never &s;at upon one in their whole Life: they make a light meal, for they eat little fle&s;h; the be&s;t of their food are Pigeons, Phea&s;ants, and their <HI>Olio</HI>'s which are excellent; but the greate&s;t Lord has not brought to his Table above two Pi|geons, and &s;ome very bad Ragou, full of Garlick and Pepper; and after that &s;ome Fennel and a little Fruit: when this little Dinner is over, every one in the Hou&s;e undre&s;s them&s;elves, and lye down upon their Beds, upon which they lay <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lea|ther-Skins for coolne&s;s: at this time you &s;hall not find a &s;oul in the Streets; the Shops are &s;hut, all Trade ceas'd, and it looks as if every body were dead. At two a Clock in the Winter, and at four in the Summer, they begin to dre&s;s them&s;elves a|gain,
<PB N="235" REF="120"> then eat Sweet-meats, drink either &s;ome Chocolate, or Waters cool'd in Ice, and afterwards every body goes where they think fit; and indeed they tarry out till eleven or twelve a Clock at Night, I &s;peak of People that live regularly. Then the Husband and Wife go to Bed, a great Table-Cloth is &s;pread all over the Bed, and each fa&s;tens it under their Chin; the <HI>He</HI> and <HI>She</HI> Dwarfs &s;erve up Supper, which is as frugal as the Din|ner, for it is either a Phea&s;ant Hen made into a Ragou, or &s;ome Pa&s;try bus'ne&s;s, which burns the Mouth, it is &s;o exce&s;&s;ively pepper'd. The Lady drinks her belly full of Water, and the Gentleman very &s;paringly of the Wine, and when Supper is ended, each goes to &s;leep as well as they can.</P>
<P>The unmarry'd, or tho&s;e who ob&s;erve but few rules with their Wives, after they have been taking the Air in the <HI>Prado,</HI> where in Summer they go half naked in their Coaches; I mean when 'tis dark they get a light Supper, mount their Hor&s;es, and take a Foot-man behind them, they do this that they may not lo&s;e him; for going in the darke&s;t Night through &s;o many Streets very quick, how &s;hould a Foot-man be able to turn and wind, and follow his Ma&s;ter? But they are al&s;o afraid of being a&s;&s;ault|ed behind, the Footman having no other care than to look a|bout him, is as it were the Sentinel, and is ready to defend his Ma&s;ter. There may be &s;ome which will do this, but mo&s;t of them in &s;uch ca&s;es run away, for they are not &s;tout. This no|cturnal Ramble is upon the Ladies account, they then vi&s;it them, and to gain an Empire, they would not negle&s;t that op|portunity. They talk to them through the Lattice of their Windows, &s;ometimes they go into their Gardens, and when they can into their Chambers. Their Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o violent, that they'll look the greate&s;t danger in the face; they'll go to the very place where the Husband &s;leeps, and I have been told that they'll &s;ee one another years together, without daring to &s;peak one word, for fear of being heard. They are ignorant in <HI>France</HI> what 'tis to love at the rate the&s;e People are &s;aid to love. And not to mention the cares, the earne&s;t de&s;ires, the nicety, and the devoting of them&s;elves up even to death, (for the Husband and the Relations give no quarter) that which I admire, is their Fidelity and Secre&s;ie. It is never known, that a <HI>Cavallero</HI> boa&s;ts of having receiv'd Favours from a Lady; they &s;peak of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with &s;o much re&s;pect and value, as if they were their Sovereigns. And on the other hand, the&s;e Ladies never de&s;ire to oblige any other than their Gallants, they are entirely taken up with him; and although they cannot &s;ee him in the day-time, yet they have opportunity to employ &s;everal hours
<PB N="236" REF="121"> about him, either in writing to, or &s;peaking of him with &s;ome &s;he Friend who is privy to the Intreague; or el&s;e in waiting all the day long, and looking through their Lattices to &s;ee him go by. In a word, upon all that I have been told about the&s;e Mat|ters, I can ea&s;ily believe, that <HI>Love</HI> had its Birth in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> are with their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, their Foot|men look after their Hor&s;es at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e; but there are very often unplea&s;ant Mi&s;chances happen to them, for there being no nece&s;&s;ary places in their Hou&s;es, all night long they throw that out of their Windows, which decency hinders me from naming to you; &s;o that the amorous <HI>Spaniard</HI> which goes &s;ilently along the Street, is many times in a na&s;ty condition from head to foot; and though at his coming out he was curiou&s;ly perfum'd, yet he is forc'd to return as fa&s;t as he can to change his Cloths. This is one of the greate&s;t Inconve|niencies in this City, and which renders it &s;o &s;tinking and filthy, that in the Morning one can hardly pa&s;s along the Streets. I &s;ay in the Morning, for the Air is here &s;o &s;ubtile and hot, that all this na&s;tine&s;s is con&s;um'd before Noon. When a Hor&s;e, or any other Animal dies, they throw him into the Street where he happens to be, though it were before the Pallace-Gate, and the next day you'll find him reduc'd to du&s;t. They are per&s;uaded, that if they did not throw out their Filth and Carrion in this manner into their Streets, <HI>Madrid</HI> would not be long without the Plague, and it never is there.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides tho&s;e ways I have now mention'd, that Gallants have to &s;ee their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have yet others; for the La|dies vi&s;it one another frequently, and there is nothing more ea&s;ie for them than to wear a Vail, and by the back door go in|to a Chair, and be carry'd where they will: And this is the more practicable, becau&s;e all the Women agree to keep one anothers Secrets inviolably, let there be what Differences there will a|mong&s;t them, and let them never be &s;o angry one again&s;t ano|ther, yet they never open their lips to make the lea&s;t Di&s;cove|ry; their Di&s;cretion cannot be &s;ufficiently prais'd: It is true in|deed, the con&s;equences would be more fatal if they did other|wi&s;e, &s;ince they make nothing here of murthering upon a bare Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>After this manner, the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ies make their Vi&s;its to one ano|ther; you mu&s;t not go to &s;ee your Friend when you have a mind, you mu&s;t tarry till you are de&s;ir'd to come, and the Lady that has a mind to be vi&s;ited, writes a Letter in the Morning, and invites you, you are carry'd in a Chair which is extream <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> every way, and that they may be the lighter, they are
<PB N="237" REF="121"> made only of a thin &s;tuff hung upon a wooden frame, the&s;e &s;tuffs are always mixt with Gold and Silver, and are very rich; they have in them three great Gla&s;&s;es, and the top is made of a very thin Leather, lin'd as the re&s;t, and it opens upwards that &s;o one may go in and out more conveniently; to every Chair there's four Bearers, which relieve one another, and a Footman carries the Hat of the foremo&s;t; for let it be what Weather it will, he mu&s;t not be cover'd before his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Lady is &s;et as fa&s;t in her Chair, as a Diamond-&s;tone in a Ring; &s;he ei|ther wears no Mantle or Vail then, or if &s;he does, it has a black <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace &s;et on it, half an Ell deep very fine and dear; this is becoming enough: &s;he has al&s;o a Coach with four Mules in tho&s;e long Traces I have formerly mentioned, which follows &s;oftly after the Chair, that is commonly fill'd with old Gentle|men-U&s;hers, and five or &s;ix Pages; for every body has the&s;e, my Banker's Wife has two. The Ladies never take any of their Women with them; and though &s;everal of them are going the &s;ame place, yet they each of them take a Chair to them&s;elves, and do not go together in any one of their Coaches. I hap|pen'd t'other day, to be in a &s;top there was in a Street, and there came by me fifty Chairs, and as many Coaches one after ano|ther, they came out of the Dutche&s;s <HI>De Frias,</HI> and went to the Dutche&s;s <HI>D' &V;zeda</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I'll tell you why they went thither, when I have fir&s;t told you that when the Lady is come to her Hou&s;e whom &s;he goes to vi&s;it, the Chairmen carry her as far as the Anti-chamber, the Stairs are made purpo&s;ely very wide and low, for the greater ea&s;e, a&s;&s;oon as &s;he is &s;et down, &s;he &s;ends away all her People and her Coach, and appoints them what hour to come and fetch her home, which is u&s;ually between ten and eleven a Clock, for their Vi&s;its are long enough to tire the greate&s;t Patience.</P>
<P>There never comes any Men where they are met, a jealous Husband would have little to do to &s;eek his Wife among them; he would be laught at, and they would not vouch&s;afe to give him any other Satisfaction, than telling him, <HI>That &s;he is where he is not.</HI> The good Women are cunning enough, and they make u&s;e of this liberty; for you mu&s;t know that every Hou&s;e has its back doors, by which they can &s;teal out, and never be &s;een. Be|&s;ides this, every one has a Brother at her Si&s;ters, a Son at her Mothers, or a Nephew at her Aunts, and this is another pretence they make u&s;e of to &s;ee their Lover. Love in this Country is very ingenious, nothing is neglected to gratifie their Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s meets with Fidelity; there are Intrigues that la&s;t one's Life, and yet there has not been an hours time lo&s;s to
<PB N="238" REF="122"> accompli&s;h them, all Opportunities are improv'd, and there needs no more after &s;eeing and liking one another.</P>
<P>I was &s;ome days ago at the Marchione&s;s <HI>D' Alcannizas,</HI> &s;he's one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t vertuous Ladies of the Court; di&s;|cour&s;ing of the&s;e things, &s;he very freely &s;aid to us, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that if a <HI>Cavallero</HI> &s;hould be convenienly alone with me half an hour, and did not ask me all that a Man could ask, I &s;hould re&s;ent it &s;o briskly, that I would &s;tab him if I could. And would you grant him all the Favours he might ask you, interrupted the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>De Liche,</HI> who is young and hand&s;ome? That does not follow, replied my Lady <HI>D' Alcannizas,</HI> on the contrary, I have rea&s;on to believe, that I &s;hould grant him nothing at all; but then I could not reproach him with any thing, whereas if he made no attempt upon me, I &s;hould conclude he de&s;pi&s;ed me. There are few, I believe, but what are of the &s;ame opinion in this matter.</P>
<P>There's one thing I find very odd, and not to look well, me|thinks in a Catholick Kingdom, and that is, The tollerating of Men, that keep Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;o openly, without the lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;e; it is very true that they are forbid by the Laws, but they value not the Laws, and only obey their own Inclinations, and yet no body offers to call them to account, or to reprove them in the lea&s;t. The&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are called <HI>Amancebades;</HI> though a Man is mar|ried, yet he mu&s;t have one of the&s;e Creatures, and often the <HI>na|tural</HI> Children are brought up with the <HI>legitimate</HI> in the &s;ight of the poor Wife, who patiently bears all this without &s;o much as &s;peaking a word. It is very &s;eldom one hears of any Differences between Husband and Wife, and yet &s;eldomer, that they &s;eparate as in <HI>France.</HI> Of an infinite number of Per&s;ons that I know here, I have only &s;een the Prince&s;s <HI>Della Rocea,</HI> that does not live with her Husband, but in a <HI>Convent,</HI> the Courts of Ju&s;tice are not much troubled here with dome&s;tick Quarrels.</P>
<P>It &s;eems extraordinary to me that a Lady who loves, and is be|lov'd by a <HI>Cavallero,</HI> is not jealous of his <HI>Amancebada;</HI> &s;he looks upon her as a &s;econd Wife, and believes &s;he cannot &s;tand in com|petition with her; &s;o that a Man has his <HI>Wife,</HI> his <HI>Amancebade,</HI> and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, this la&s;t is generally a Per&s;on of Quality; 'tis &s;he that is vi&s;ited in the Night, and for whom they venture their Lives.</P>
<P>It happens &s;ometimes that a Lady cover'd with her great plain Mantle or Vail, and not &s;hewing any more of her Face than half an Eye, and being ordinarily dre&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he would not be known, and having no mind to take a Chair, walks afoot to the place of Rendezvous; either her being little us'd to walk, or ve|ry often, her manner and way di&s;tingui&s;hes her: a <HI>Cavallero</HI> fol|lows, and begins to talk to her, unea&s;ie to have &s;uch a Compani|on
<PB N="239" REF="122"> which it is hard to get rid of, &s;he addre&s;&s;es her &s;elf to the fir&s;t &s;he meets, and without further di&s;covery of her &s;elf, I conjure you, &s;ays &s;he to him, to hinder this importunate Man to follow me any longer, his curio&s;ity may injure my affairs; this Reque&s;t a|mounts to a command with a brave <HI>Spaniard;</HI> he asks him again&s;t whom the Lady complains, why he will pre&s;s upon her again&s;t her mind, and if he meets with an ob&s;tinate Per&s;on, the Sword mu&s;t be drawn, and &s;ometimes they kill each other, without knowing for whom they have &s;o expos'd them&s;elves. In the mean while, the Lady makes the be&s;t of her way, leaves them fighting together, and goes where &s;he's expected; but the je&s;t is, that very often this proves either to be the Husband or the Brother that a&s;&s;erts her Cau&s;e, and by defending her from the Pur&s;uit of the inqui&s;itive, gives her an Opportunity to enjoy the embraces of her Gallant.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a young Lady who dearly lov'd her Husband, being inform'd that he did not live &s;o regularly as he &s;hould, di&s;|guis'd her &s;elf, put on her Vail, and &s;tanding in a Street he us'd often to pa&s;s through, &s;he &s;py'd him and gave him an Opportu|nity to &s;peak to her. After he had occo&s;ted her, &s;he began to <HI>thou</HI> him; and 'tis commonly in this familiar way that the Wo|men in this Country make known their Inclinations. He made a Propo&s;al to her, which &s;he accepted, but upon condition that he &s;hould not be de&s;irous either to &s;ee her or know who &s;he was: he promi&s;ed he would not, and &s;o led her to a Friend of his; at their parting he a&s;&s;ur'd her, that he thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t of Men, and that Fortune had never been &s;o kind to him before, and then gave her a very fine Ring, and begged her to keep it for his &s;ake. I'll keep and love it dearly, and will meet <HI>thee</HI> here again when thou wilt, &s;ays &s;he to him, for I had as good have thy Jewels as another. When &s;he had ended the&s;e words, &s;he open|ed her Vail, and the Husband &s;eeing 'twas his Wife, was in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable at his Adventure; but he con&s;i|dered, that &s;ince &s;he had &s;o well contriv'd the matter as to get out of her Hou&s;e to watch him, &s;he might al&s;o find a way to play him &s;ome other trick le&s;s plea&s;ant; and therefore to be &s;ecure of her, he appointed two <HI>Duennas</HI> con&s;tantly to look after her, and they never after left her.</P>
<P>It happens al&s;o &s;ometimes, that when a Man's Hou&s;e is not near the Place, where by chance he meets his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he goes without Ceremony into the next he comes at, whether he is ac|quainted there or no, he civilly intreats the Ma&s;ter to let him have a Room to him&s;elf, becau&s;e he has now an Opportunity to di&s;|cour&s;e with a Lady, which if he lo&s;es, he &s;hall not have the like in a long time; this is enough to make the Ma&s;ter grant an Ac|commodation
<PB N="240" REF="123"> to the Gallant and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes, I a&s;&s;ure you, 'tis the very Wife of the Fool that goes away &s;o kind|ly; in a word, they will venture &s;trangely for an Opportunity of &s;eeing each other, though but for a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>I remember a <HI>French</HI> Lady, di&s;cour&s;ing of a certain Man to one of her Friends, &s;aid, <HI>Shew me an amorous Man, and I'll &s;hew you one ruin'd.</HI> This Maxim is verifi'd here, more than in any place in the World; a Lover or a Gallant has nothing that he can call his own. It is no matter whether &s;he either &s;ees, or has a real occa&s;ion for a thing, 'tis &s;ufficient if &s;he does but barely de&s;ire it, they are never deny'd any thing, and the manner of giving it, en|haun&s;es their Liberality. I find them nothing near &s;o amicable as our <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> but 'tis &s;aid they know how to love at a greater rate. Be&s;ides, their Behaviour is a thou&s;and times more re&s;pect|ful, nay this extends &s;o far, that when a Man, let him be of what Quality he will, pre&s;ents any thing, or gives a Letter to a Lady, he kneels upon one knee, and he does the &s;ame, when he receives any thing from her hand.</P>
<P>I &s;aid I would tell you, why &s;o many Ladies went to the Dut|che&s;s of <HI>D' &V;zeda</HI>'s; &s;he is very amiable, and Daughter to the Duke <HI>D' O&s;&s;one,</HI> her Husband has had a Quarrel with the Prince <HI>De Stillano,</HI> about a Lady which they both love; they drew their Swords, and 'tis like to be an ill bu&s;ine&s;s. The King has caus'd them to be arre&s;ted, that is, they are not made Pri&s;oners, but he has confin'd them to their Hou&s;es; unle&s;s they privately go abroad in the Night to pur&s;ue their u&s;ual amorous Plea&s;ures. And that which is &s;trange, the poor Wife mu&s;t not &s;et her foot out of door as long as her Husband is under the&s;e Confinements, though it is almo&s;t con&s;tantly for &s;ome piece of Infidelity he is guilty of towards her. And it is the &s;ame al&s;o, if they be bani&s;ht, or &s;ent to remain upon &s;ome of their own E&s;tates in the Country, which frequently happens. In all the time of their Ab&s;ence, their Wives keep hou&s;e without &s;o much as once going abroad. I have been told, that the Dutche&s;s <HI>D' O&s;&s;one,</HI> was a Pri&s;oner after this manner for above two Years; this is the Cu&s;tom, but it makes ones Life very dull and tedious.</P>
<P>But 'tis not only the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies, who are &s;o tir'd and unea&s;ie here, the <HI>French</HI> find but little diver&s;ion: We are in a few days to go to <HI>Arranjues</HI> and <HI>Tolledo</HI> to ki&s;s the Queen Mothers hand; I'll write you, dear Cou&s;in, the particulars of that &s;mall Journey, and I wi&s;h with all my Soul I were in a condition to give you more e&s;|&s;ential marks of my Affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>BY my la&s;t Letter, I told you, Dear Cou&s;in, that we were to ki&s;s the Queen Mother's Hand; I have had this Honour, but before I conduct you thither, give me leave to tell you of &s;omething el&s;e. I would not go from <HI>Madrid</HI> till I had &s;een the Entry of the Marqui&s;s <HI>De Villars;</HI> he made it on Hor&s;e-back, which is the Cu&s;tom here, and if a Man be hand&s;om, it is very advantagious for him: when the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador made his, it was happy for him that he was not in his Coach; he had one that was worth twelve thou&s;and Crowns, which in going from his Hou&s;e was overturn'd, and as it was in Winter, the <HI>Mar&eacute;e</HI> (which is that na&s;ty black dirt that &s;tands in great puddles in the Streets, and through which a Hor&s;e goes up to his Girts) &s;o &s;poil'd the Velvet with a Gold ground, and the rich Embroidery it was &s;et off with, that it could never &s;erve again. I thought it &s;trange that for &s;uch u&s;ual Sights as the&s;e <HI>Entrees</HI> are, the Ladies &s;hould all be in their Balconies, in their rich Apparel, and with the &s;ame earne&s;tne&s;s, as if it was to &s;ee the greate&s;t King upon earth; but they have &s;o little liberty, that they are glad to embrace all Occa&s;ions to &s;hew them&s;elves; and as their Lovers and Gallants hardly ever &s;peak to them, &s;o they take care to place their Coaches as near their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Balco|ny, as they can, that &s;o they may the more ea&s;ily di&s;cour&s;e with them by their Eyes and their Fingers; this is a Practice that is very u&s;eful to them for the under&s;tanding one anothers Minds, and they do it more readily than with their Voice, this &s;ilent Language &s;eems to me very difficult unle&s;s one were long us'd to it; but they are early acquainted with it, and but two days &s;ince, I &s;aw a Girl of about &s;ix years old and a Boy of the &s;ame Age, which under&s;tood by this way to tell one another a thou&s;and pretty things. <HI>Don Frederick De Cordonna,</HI> who ob|&s;erved them as well as I, but under&s;tood them far better, ex|plained to me every thing they &s;aid; and if he did not add to the Di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e two Children, one mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that in this Country, they are born for <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Court&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacio,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Don Fernand de Tolleda,</HI> is one of my Kin&s;woman's be&s;t Friends; &s;he has a fine Hou&s;e call'd <HI>Igarica,</HI> upon the Banks of <HI>Xarama,</HI> and though
<PB N="242" REF="124"> this Lady is now very old, yet &s;he never was there, notwith|&s;tanding it is but eight leagues from <HI>Madrid.</HI> It is not lookt upon in this Country to be according to Grandeur to go vi&s;it their Lands, except they lie in &s;ome Principality or &s;ome City, and then they call them by the Name of their <HI>State.</HI> I chid this Lady for her Carele&s;ne&s;s, and my Kin&s;woman engag'd her to make one in the Company of her Daughter <HI>Donna Mariguita,</HI> who is a little Woman, pale, fat and fair; the&s;e three Qualities are equally rare here, and &s;he's admir'd by every body that &s;ees her; the young Marchione&s;s <HI>De la Ro&s;a,</HI> would al&s;o be of our Company, her Husband, with <HI>Don Fernand de Tolleda, Don San|che, Sarmiento,</HI> and <HI>E&s;teve de Carvajal,</HI> went on Hor&s;eback; <HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</HI> would not have fail'd of being there too, had not the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> writ him to come to him in all ha&s;te: when he told it me, I de&s;ir'd him to go &s;ee the fair Marchione&s;s <HI>De Los Rios alas Huelgas.</HI> I gave him a Letter for her, in which I taxt her with her &s;ilence, and de&s;ir'd to know particularly how all things went. We &s;et forward in two Coaches the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at ten a Clock at Night, in the fi|ne&s;t Weather that could be; the Heats were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that unle&s;s one would venture their Lives, it was impo&s;&s;ible to tra|vel in the day-time; but the Nights are cool, and the Coaches are in the Summer all open; the &s;ides of the Coach were turn|ed up quite round, with fine large Holland Curtains, trim'd with fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bone-lace, and ty'd with Knots of colour'd Ribbond, and as they often change them, they look very neat. We went &s;o &s;wift, that I was almo&s;t dead with fear lea&s;t &s;ome|thing about our Coach &s;hould break; for it is certain, that we might have been all kill'd a hundred times over, before the Coachman would have known any thing of the matter. I fancy they run &s;o, to make amends for their &s;low going in <HI>Madrid;</HI> for even the Foot-pace of the Mules is too quick there, becau&s;e of the ill pavement, the holes, the dirt in Winer, and the du&s;t in Summer, with which the Streets are extreamly troubled. The Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacios</HI> wore a little Hat, trim'd with Feathers, according to the mode of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies when they go into the Country; and the Marchione&s;s <HI>De la Ro&s;a</HI> lookt very pretty in her &s;hort clo&s;e-coat, &s;trait &s;leeves, and her other Ornaments, upon &s;ight of which, we cried out, that we thought her <HI>Muy Bizzarra,</HI> and <HI>Muy de Gala,</HI> that is, very gallant and very &s;plen|did.</P>
<P>It was very odd methinks, that the&s;e Ladies &s;hould oblige us in three &s;everal Places upon the Road to alight out of our Coach, and hear the Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Ro&s;a</HI>'s two Gentlemen
<PB N="243" REF="124"> play upon the Guittar, whom it &s;eems they brought on pur|po&s;e, and it was pretty comical to &s;ee the&s;e Blades gallop with their Guittars hanging behind their Backs. This ordinary con|&s;ort of Mu&s;ick was neverthele&s;s ravi&s;hing to them, and they were extreamly charm'd with the plea&s;antne&s;s of the Country in &s;o fine a Night. Indeed, I never &s;aw Women &s;o infinitely &s;a|tisfy'd. We arrived at <HI>Arranjues</HI> about five a Clock in the Morning, and I was amaz'd at its wonderful Situation; half a League on this &s;ide the <HI>Tagus</HI> we pa&s;s'd over a wodden Bridge, which is made to &s;hut up; and after that we came into &s;ome Walks of Elme and Lyme Trees, which were &s;o high, green and &s;hady, that the heat of the Sun is never felt. It is an extraor|dinary thing to find &s;o near <HI>Madrid,</HI> Trees &s;o perfect in their kind, for the Soyl is very barren, and they will not grow there; but yet near <HI>Arranjues,</HI> one cannot perceive this defect I &s;peak of, for all along the Walks, and near the Trees, there are lit|tle Pits and Trenches made, into which the Water of <HI>Tagus</HI> runs and moy&s;tens the roots of the Trees. The&s;e Avenues are &s;o long, that when one is in the middle, one cannot &s;ee to the end of 'em. Several Alleys come into the&s;e, and every way make the perfect figure of a Star. People walk on the Banks of the <HI>Tagus</HI> and <HI>Xamara,</HI> which are two famous Rivers that environ the I&s;land in which <HI>Arranjues</HI> &s;tands, and which &s;up|plies it with Water, and extreamly contributes to its beautiful|ne&s;s. To &s;peak truly, I never &s;aw a more delightful place; I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Gardens are too clo&s;e, and &s;everal of their Al|leys too narrow, but yet it ravi&s;hes one to walk there; and at our coming into them, I fancy'd my &s;elf in &s;ome enchanted Palace. The Morning was cool, every where the Birds made a &s;weet Melody, and the Waters a plea&s;ant murmuring noi&s;e, the Trees and Hedges were loaden with excellent Fruit, and the <HI>Parterres</HI> were cover'd with mo&s;t odoriferent Flowers, and I enjoy'd all this in mo&s;t plea&s;ant Company. We had an Order from <HI>Don John</HI> to be lodg'd in the Ca&s;tle, &s;o that the <HI>Alcade</HI> receiv'd us with great Civility, and was very careful to &s;hew us every thing that was the mo&s;t remarkable. The Fountains are in that number, and there are &s;o very many of them, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s through an Alley, to go into an Arbor, or upon a <HI>Patere</HI> or Terra&s;s without taking notice of five or &s;ix with bra&s;en Statues, and marble Ba&s;ins: The Spouts throw up their Water to a va&s;t height, they are not fed from Springs, but from the <HI>Tagus.</HI> Among&s;t others, I'll give you an account of the Fountain of <HI>Diana;</HI> It &s;tands upon an a&s;cent, from whence it is &s;een at a great di&s;tance; the Godde&s;s is in the mid&s;t, en|viron'd
<PB N="244" REF="125"> with Bucks, Does, and Dogs, and every one of them &s;pouts out Water. A litttle lower is a circle of Myrrh, cut in &s;everal fa&s;hions, and little <HI>Cupids</HI> peeping out half way, and throw the Water again&s;t tho&s;e Animals which &s;tand about the Fountain. The Mountain of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> rai&s;es up its head in the mid&s;t of a great Pond, with <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;es, Paga&s;&s;ius</HI>'s Hor&s;e, and a fall of Water which repre&s;ents the River of <HI>Heli|con.</HI> Out of a Rock there i&s;&s;ues out a thou&s;and &s;everal Spouts of Water, &s;ome lanching out, others winding in and out like a Serpent upon the Surface of the Pond; &s;ome gliding gently, and others, either falling like Flowers in the Air, or el&s;e like Rain. The Fountain of <HI>Ganymedes</HI> is al&s;o very pretty, this beau|tiful Child &s;itting upon <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Eagle, &s;eems frighted with its flight; the Bird &s;its on the top of a Pillar with its Wings &s;pread; he throws out the Water by his Beak and his Tallons; the Fountain of <HI>Mars</HI> is near this: That of the <HI>Harpyes</HI> is fine, they are placed upon very high Marble Pillars; at the four cor|ners they throw out Water every way, they &s;eem to have a mind to drown a little Youth who &s;its in the middle of the Fountain, picking a Thorn out of his Foot. But the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant of all is, the Fountain of <HI>Love;</HI> this little God &s;eems to ri&s;e with his Body all full of Darts, from every one of which comes out a Spout of Water. The three <HI>Graces</HI> &s;it at the Feet of the <HI>God of Love;</HI> but that which is mo&s;t extraordinary, is the Water which falls from four high Trees like Fountains, who&s;e noi&s;e is very delighful and &s;urprizing, it not being natural for Water to come out of Trees.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be afraid to tire you, did I undertake to tell you the va&s;t number of Cataracts, Falls, and Fountains of Water which I have &s;een here, I will only in general a&s;&s;ure you, that it is a Place worthy of the curio&s;ity and attention of every body. At eight a Clock the Sun began to be too hot, and &s;ome went in|to the Hou&s;e, which comes far &s;hort of that Beauty it &s;hould have, ju&s;tly to an&s;wer all the other things; and when the King goes there, tho&s;e that attend him are &s;o ill accommodated with Lodging, that either he mu&s;t be contented to go there in all ha&s;te, and keep his Court a little, or el&s;e go as far as <HI>Tolleda;</HI> for there are only two bad Inns, and a very few private Hou&s;es. If we had not taken care before hand for Provi&s;ions, even to Bread, I am confident we had met with none, unle&s;s the <HI>Alcade</HI> would have given us &s;ome of his. And by the way, I'll inform you the difference there's between the <HI>Alcade</HI> and <HI>Alcalde,</HI> that &s;o you may not confound them; the fir&s;t &s;ignifies the Gover|nor of a Ca&s;tle or Place, and the other a Serjeant. Although
<PB N="245" REF="125"> the mo&s;t curious Pictures are at the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> yet I found &s;ome excellent ones in the King's Appartment at <HI>Arranjues;</HI> it is fur|ni&s;ht according to the Sea&s;on we are now in, that is to &s;ay, the Walls are all white, have only a Matt that is very fine and thin about three foot deep with &s;ome Looking-gla&s;&s;es and Pictures. In this Building there are divers little Courts, which takes from the grace of it. We eat our Breakfa&s;t all together, and they per&s;waded me to eat &s;ome of a Fruit they call <HI>Pimento,</HI> which is as long as one's finger, but as hot as Pepper, the lea&s;t bit of which puts ones Mouth in a Flame, they let it lie &s;teeping in Vinegar and Salt, to get out the Virtue: this Fruit is brought into <HI>Spain</HI> growing upon a Plant; and I never &s;aw any of it in other Countrys where I have been. We had an <HI>Ollio,</HI> &s;ome Ragous made of cold Partridges with Oyl, Canary Wine, fat Pullets, and Pigeons which are excellent here, and al&s;o &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit, which was extraordinary fair. When this Repa&s;t, which was worth a Dinner, was ended, we went to Bed, and went not a walking till about &s;even a Clock in the Evening. The Charms of this Place were as new to me as if I had not &s;een them in the Morning, but particularly, I &s;till admir'd the Situ|ation, which indeed ravi&s;hes, on what &s;ide &s;oever one turns the Eyes. The King is there, with half a dozen of his Guards, in great &s;afety, becau&s;e there's no getting at him but over Bridges, which are all drawn up, and the <HI>Xamara,</HI> which in this Place, &s;wells the Waters of <HI>Tagas,</HI> fortifies <HI>Arranjus.</HI> After we had walkt till ten a Clock at Night, we came back into a great Hall, pav'd with Marble, and &s;upported with Pillars of the &s;ame. It was all enlightned with divers brancht Candle&s;ticks, and <HI>Don E&s;teve de Carvajal</HI> had privately got thither &s;everal Mu&s;icians, which were a plea&s;ant &s;ort of a &s;urprize to us, at lea&s;t the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Ladies and my Kin&s;woman were mightily delighted with them. For my part, I thought they &s;ung too much in the Throat, and their Divi&s;ions and Shakes were &s;o long, that they were tedious; not but that their Voices are good, but their manner of &s;inging is not good, and generally the greate&s;t part in <HI>Spain,</HI> do not &s;ing as they do in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> When Supper was done, we went to the great Canal, where there's a &s;mall <HI>Gal|lion</HI> painted and gilt, we went aboard her, and tarry'd till two a Clock in the Morning, and then we &s;et forward on our way to <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>I took notice when we came out of <HI>Arranjues,</HI> that the Ground was all Heath and Ling, and yet the Air was perfum'd with wild and mother Tyme, with which the&s;e Plains were all co|ver'd. They told me there were a great many Rabits, Stags,
<PB N="246" REF="126"> Does, and Fallow Deer, but it was not then their time to ap|pear. Our Conver&s;ation was for &s;ometime general, and for two Leagues together from <HI>Arranjues,</HI> I did not &s;peak one word to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> th&ocirc; he &s;at ju&s;t clo&s;e by me; But being willing to imploy the time, in thoroughly informing my &s;elf about all the Particulars of the cruel <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which he had promis'd to acquaint me with, I de&s;ir'd him to let me know &s;omething of it,</P>
<P>The <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> &s;ays he, has not been known in <HI>Europe,</HI> but &s;ince the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. Before that time, the Bi&s;hops and <HI>Civil</HI> Magi&s;trates, enquir'd after <HI>Here|ticks,</HI> and either condemn'd them to Bani&s;hment, or to the Forfeiture of their Goods and E&s;tates, or el&s;e, to &s;ome other Penalties, which never almo&s;t extended to <HI>Death:</HI> But the va&s;t number of <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> which appear'd towards the end of the Twelfth Age, caus'd that Tribunal to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd: The <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ent &s;everal <HI>Religious</HI> Per&s;ons to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Princes and Bi|&s;hops, to exhort them, to take an extraordinary care, in the Extirpation of <HI>Here&s;ies,</HI> and to bring ob&s;tinate <HI>Hereticks</HI> to puni&s;hments: and thus things continued till the Year 1250.</P>

<P>To that time the <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> had a limited Power, and it was often conte&s;ted by the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> to whom the Cognizance of <HI>Heritical</HI> Crimes belong'd.

The Number of the <HI>Familiars</HI> and &s;mall Offi|cers is very great, becau&s;e all that belong to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> be|ing not &s;ubject to or tryable by any other Juri&s;diction, &s;helter them&s;elves here from the ordinary Courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Supream</HI> Council hath a full and &s;ole Authority over the other <HI>Inqui&s;itions,</HI> which cannot perform any <HI>Auto</HI> or Executi|on, without leave from the Great and General <HI>Inqui&s;itor:</HI> The particular <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> are tho&s;e of <HI>Sevile, Tolleda, Grenada, Cordua, Cuenca, Vailladolid, Marcia, Derena, Logronno,</HI> St. <HI>James Sarago&s;&s;a, Valantia, Barcelona, Majorque, Sardaignia, Palermo, Canaries, Mexico, Cartagena,</HI> and <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e <HI>Inqui&s;itions</HI> is compos'd of three <HI>Inqui&s;itors,</HI> three <HI>Secretaries,</HI> one <HI>Alguazil Mayor,</HI> and of three Receivers, Qualificators and Con&s;ulters.</P>
<P>All Per&s;ons that take any of the&s;e Employments upon them, are oblig'd to make out their Proofs <HI>De ca&s;a Limpia,</HI> that is, that their Family is not &s;tain'd with any thing of <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> or <HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> and that they are <HI>Catholicks</HI> from the beginning.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of this Tribunal are very unu&s;ual. A man is Arre&s;ted and lies in Pri&s;on, without knowing the Crime he is accus'd of, or the Witne&s;&s;es which depo&s;e again&s;t him: He cannot come out thence, unle&s;s he will own the Fault, of which often he is not guilty, and which the de&s;ire of Liberty forces him to confe&s;s, for they do not put one to death for the fir&s;t time; but then the Family is markt with Infamy, and this fir&s;t Judgment makes the Per&s;ons uncapable of any Employment.</P>
<P>There's no confronting of Witne&s;&s;es, nor any means for a Man to defend him&s;elf, becau&s;e this Tribunal above all things
<PB N="248" REF="127"> affects an inviolable Secre&s;y.

<P>The &s;everity of this Court was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the <HI>Inqui|&s;itor Torquemada</HI> try'd above a hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons, of which &s;ix thou&s;and were condemn'd to be Burnt in the compa&s;s of fourteen Years.</P>
<P>It is pretended, that the &s;ight of &s;o many Criminals con|demn'd to &s;o terrible a Death, without any regard either to their Sex or Quality confirms and keeps the People in the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Religion, and that 'tis the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> alone, that has hindred the wickede&s;t <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> from &s;preading them&s;elves in <HI>Spain,</HI> even in that time when all <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides was infected with them. For this rea&s;on, the <HI>Kings</HI> have given &s;uch Arbi|trary Authority to this Tribunal, which is call'd the <HI>Tribunal</HI> of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI></P>
<P>The general Acts of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which by the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe,</HI> are lookt upon, only as a bare Execution of Criminals, among&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are e&s;teem'd a <HI>Religious</HI> Ce|remony by which his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty gives publick proofs of his <HI>Zeal</HI> for Religion. And therefore, are call'd by 'em <HI>Autos de F&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>Acts of Faith;</HI> commonly they are perform'd either at the Acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Kings</HI> to the Crown, or at their coming to Age, that &s;o they may be the more Authentick: The la&s;t was in the Year 1632. and there is one now making ready for the <HI>King</HI>'s Marriage. As there has not been one of a long time, &s;o there are great preparations making to render this as Solemn and as Magnificent as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e &s;orts of Ceremonies to be. One of the Coun&s;ellors of the Inqui&s;ition has already drawn a Project of it, which he has &s;hew'd me: Here's the Con|tents of it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>great Place</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there &s;hall be a Theater erected fifty Foot long; It &s;hall be rais'd as high as the Balcony de|&s;ign'd for the <HI>King,</HI> and no higher.</P>
<P>On the right-&s;ide of the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, quite cro&s;s the Theater, there &s;hall be rais'd an Amphitheater, of twenty five or thirty Steps, de&s;ign'd for the Council of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and the other Councils of <HI>Spain,</HI> on the uppermo&s;t of which &s;hall be placed the <HI>Chairs</HI> under a Canopy, for the <HI>General Inqui&s;itor</HI> a great deal higher then the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony. On the left of the the Theater and the King's Balcony, there &s;hall be another, Amphitheater as big as the fir&s;t, upon which the Criminals &s;hall be placed.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="127">
<P>In the middle of the great Theater, there &s;hall be rais'd a|nother very little one, on which &s;hall be made two Cages, where the Criminals &s;hall be kept while their Sentence is reading.</P>
<P>There &s;hall be likewi&s;e placed upon the great Theater, three Chairs for the Readers of the Judgment and for the Preacher, before whom there &s;hall be an Altar erected.</P>
<P>The Places for their <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ties &s;hall be &s;o order'd, that the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;hall be on the left hand of the <HI>King,</HI> and on the right of the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> All the Queen's Ladies of Ho|nour, &s;hall take up the re&s;t of the length every way of the &s;ame Balcony; there &s;hall be other Balconies prepar'd for the Amba&s;&s;adors, and Lords and Ladies of the Court, and Scaffolds for the People.</P>
<P>The Ceremony &s;hall begin by a Proce&s;&s;ion from St. <HI>Maries</HI> Church. A hundred Charcoal-men arm'd with Pikes and Muskets, &s;hall march before, becau&s;e they provide the Wood, which is to burn tho&s;e that are condemn'd to the Fire. Next them &s;hall follow the <HI>Dominicans</HI> with a white Cro&s;s carry'd be|fore them; the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> &s;hall carry the Standard of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> according to a Priviledge that's Hereditary to his Family: This Standard is of red Damask, on one &s;ide of it, is repre&s;ented a naked Sword, in a Crown of Lawrel, and on the other the Arms of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>After that, &s;hall be carry'd a green Cro&s;s, wrapt about with black Crape; and after it &s;hall march &s;everal <HI>Grandees</HI> and o|ther Per&s;ons of Quality of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> cover'd with Cloaks, that have black and white Cro&s;&s;es upon them, embroider'd with Gold-Thred. The March &s;hall be brought up by fifty Halberdiers or Guards to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> cloath'd in black and white, and commanded by the Marquis <HI>De Pouar,</HI> Hereditary Protector of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>After the Proce&s;&s;ion has in this order pa&s;t by the <HI>Pallais,</HI> it &s;hall come to the <HI>great Place;</HI> the Standart and the green Cro&s;s &s;hall be fixt upon the Altar, and the <HI>Dominicans</HI> only, &s;hall remain upon the Theater, and &s;pend part of the Night in Sing|ing P&s;alms, and as &s;oon as day breaks, they &s;hall celebrate &s;e|veral <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> upon the Altar.</P>
<P>The <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> and all the La|dies mu&s;t be in their Balconies about &s;even a Clock in the Mor|ning; at eight, the Proce&s;&s;ion &s;hall begin to march, as it did the day before, by the company of Charcoal-men, who &s;hall place them&s;elves on the left hand of the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, the right &s;hall be for his Guards. Afterwards, &s;everal Men &s;hall
<PB N="250" REF="128"> bear certain Pa&s;t-board Effigies as big as Life; &s;ome of them repre&s;enting tho&s;e that dy'd in Pri&s;on, who&s;e Bones &s;hall al&s;o be carry'd in Coffers with Flames painted round them, and the re&s;t &s;hall repre&s;ent tho&s;e who have e&s;cap'd, and who have been condemn'd for Contumacy: The&s;e Figures &s;hall be placed at one end of the Theater. After that, their Sentance &s;hall be read, and they &s;hall be executed. But I &s;hould tell ye, added he, That the Supream Council of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is more ab&s;o|lute than all the others: It is believ'd that the King him&s;elf has not Power to relea&s;e tho&s;e which &s;hall be accus'd before it, be|cau&s;e this <HI>Tribunal</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Pope</HI> only to be above it, and that there has been a time, when upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the <HI>King</HI>'s Power, was found too weak to contend with that of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition. Don Diego Sarmiento</HI> is <HI>Inqui&s;itor General;</HI> He is a mighty hone&s;t and good Man; and is about three&s;core Years of age: The <HI>King</HI> nominates the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> confirms him; But as for the <HI>Inqui&s;itors,</HI> the Pre&s;ident propo&s;es them to the King, and after he has ap|prov'd of them, he then puts them in their Places.</P>
<P>This Tribunal takes Cognizance of every thing concerning the <HI>Faith,</HI> and it is ab&s;olutely inve&s;ted both with the <HI>Pope</HI>'s and and the <HI>King</HI>'s Authority, theres no appealing from its Judg|ment; and the two and twenty Tribunals of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which are in all the <HI>E&s;tates</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and which depend upon this at <HI>Madrid,</HI> every Month render an Account to it, of their <HI>Finances,</HI> and Revenues, and every Year of their Cau&s;es and Criminals: But tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies</HI> and the other di&s;tant Places, only give an Account at the end of every Year. As to the Places of the&s;e inferior Tribunals, they are fill'd by the <HI>General Inqui&s;itors,</HI> with the Approbation of the Coun&s;ellors. It would be pretty difficult to be able preci&s;ely to reckon up the num|ber of the Officers, which belong to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition;</HI> for in <HI>Spain</HI> alone, there's above two and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Familiars</HI> of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> They are call'd by this Name, becau&s;e they are as 'twere Spies, &s;catter'd up and down every where, which are continually giving true or fal&s;e Informations to the Inqui&s;i|tion, upon which tho&s;e are &s;eiz'd and taken up, which they accu&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t with the greate&s;t Attention I was li&s;tening to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> the Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacios</HI> interrupted us, to let us know that we were come near <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and that certain old Ruines of an ancient Ca&s;tle which we &s;aw upon our left hand, were tho&s;e of an enchanted <HI>Palace.</HI> I &s;eem'd to <HI>Don Fernand</HI> to doubt of what &s;he affirm'd, upon which he &s;aid, you may
<PB N="251" REF="128"> think what you plea&s;e; but certain it is, that there's for it a very ancient <HI>Tradition</HI> in this Country; and moreover, they pretend that there is a <HI>Cave</HI> &s;hut up, and a Prophe&s;ie which threaten'd <HI>Spain</HI> with the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries, when ever this Cave was open'd: Every body terrify'd with this threat, had no mind to draw upon them&s;elves the &s;ad Effects, &s;o that this place did for &s;everal Ages remain very clo&s;e. But <HI>Don-Rodrigue,</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> le&s;s credulous, or more curious, caus'd it to be o|pen'd, upon which there were heard mo&s;t terrible Noi&s;es; e|very body thought that the very Elements them&s;elves were go|ing into confu&s;ion, there was &s;o violent a Tempe&s;t: This did not hinder him from going into it, where by light of &s;everal Elamboys, he &s;aw the Figures of divers Men, who&s;e Cloaths and Arms were very &s;trange: There was one held a Copper Blade in his hand, and upon it was writ in <HI>Arabick,</HI> that the Time drew near, for the Di&s;&s;olation of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that the Per&s;ons, who&s;e Statues were there, would ere long come. I never was in any place, &s;aid I &s;miling, where they rely'd &s;o much on fabulous Tales, as they do in <HI>Spain: Say rather,</HI> replied he, <HI>that there never was any Woman &s;o incredulous as you; and in telling you this Story, I did not think I &s;hould alter your Judg|ment; But as much as one can be a&s;&s;ur'd of a thing by the Te&s;ti|mony of Men, this Story is credible.</HI></P>
<P>It was now light enough, very plainly to ob&s;erve all the Charms of the Country. We pa&s;t the <HI>Tagus</HI> over a very great and fine Bridge, of which I had heard, and a little after di&s;co|ver'd <HI>Tolleda</HI> all &s;urrounded with Hills and Rocks, which com|mand it; There are very neat Hou&s;es built among&s;t tho&s;e Hills, de&s;ign'd for the plea&s;ure of Solitude: The Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Tolleda</HI> has one there, whether he goes often: The City &s;tands upon the Rock, the unevenne&s;s of which in divers pla|ces contributes to make it high and low; the Streets are nar|row, ill pav'd and trouble&s;ome, which is the rea&s;on, that all the People of Quality go there, either in Chairs or Litters: And as we were in a Coach, we took up our Quarters in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> becau&s;e that is only the part to which one can pa&s;s with a Coach; as &s;oon as we were arriv'd, we alight at the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Foira,</HI> which &s;tands in the Suburbs, who&s;e Building con&s;i&s;ts of three Sides, within which is a great &s;quare Court, and the Church makes up the fourth &s;ide, and there we heard <HI>Ma&s;s:</HI> This Ho&s;pital was built by an Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Tolleda,</HI> who&s;e Monument and Statue in Marble are in the mid&s;t of the body of the Church: The Walls of the City were rebuilt by the <HI>Moors;</HI> on the Sides &s;tands a great many little Towers, which hereto|fore

It was not eight a Clock when we got thither; and we would &s;pend the re&s;t of the Morning in &s;eeing the Church, which as 'tis &s;aid, is the fine&s;t in <HI>Europe:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it <HI>Holy,</HI> whether 'tis upon the Account of the <HI>Relicks</HI> which are there, or for &s;ome other rea&s;on which they did not tell me, I know not: If it was as long and as high as 'tis broad, it would be much better. It is beautify'd with divers Chappels as big as Churches; they all &s;hine with Gold and Paintings; the chief of which are tho&s;e of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Martin, Cardinal Sandoual</HI> and the <HI>Conne&s;table De Luna.</HI> In the Quire, I &s;aw a <HI>Niche,</HI> or hollow place, from whence 'tis pretended there i&s;&s;ued out for &s;everal days together, a Spring of Water with which the Soldiers and Citizens quencht their thir&s;t in the time they maintain'd the Sieges again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> when they were half dead with thir&s;t; For without digre&s;&s;ing from my &s;ubject, I mu&s;t tell you, that in the City there is not &s;o much as a Well or a Spring, and that they fetch all their Water from the <HI>Tagus,</HI> which is &s;o ve|ry trouble&s;om, that one would wonder how <HI>Tolleda</HI> comes to be &s;o full of People as 'tis. Near the entrance into the Church, there's a Marble Pillar, which they Reverence, becau&s;e the Holy <HI>Virgin</HI> appear'd upon't to St. <HI>Alphon&s;us.</HI> It is encloas'd with an Iron Gate, and through a little Window they ki&s;s it, and upon it is writ, <HI>Adoraebimus in loco ubi fleterunt pedes ejus.</HI> Be|tween every <HI>Canon</HI>'s Seat there is a Marble Pillar, and the Sculpture of the Church is fine and curiou&s;ly wrought. I was amaz'd when I &s;aw the <HI>Trea&s;ury.</HI> There mu&s;t be thirty Men to carry the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> upon <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> day. It is made of Sil|ver gilt, and there is exqui&s;itely wrought upon't &s;everal Spires of Steeples, with abundance of Angels and Cherubins: within this, there's al&s;o another of Ma&s;&s;y-gold, and &s;uch a va&s;t quan|tity of precious Stones that their value is ine&s;timable; the <HI>Chalacies,</HI> the <HI>Patins</HI> and the <HI>Pyxes</HI> are no le&s;s beautiful: In|deed, every thing &s;hines there, with great Diamonds and Ori|ental Pearls; the <HI>Sun,</HI> where the Holy Sacrament is kept, the Crowns and Robes of the <HI>Virgin</HI> are the mo&s;t &s;plendid things, that I ever &s;aw in my days. But indeed this Arch-bi&s;hoprick is &s;o very rich, that it is but ju&s;t every thing &s;hould be an&s;wer|able to it. I have told you, dear <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> that the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> inform'd me, that the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Tollada</HI> had three hundred and Fifty thou&s;and Crowns a Year.

<P>After we had &s;pent a great deal of time in con&s;idering the fine things with which this Court was fill'd, we re&s;olv'd to re|turn to our Inn, where we had left our Coach; and ju&s;t when we were going away, there came to us an Almoner and a Gentleman that belong'd to Cardinal <HI>Porto Carrero,</HI> who &s;ent them to complement us, and to a&s;&s;ure us, that by no means we mu&s;t lodge any where el&s;e than at the <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops</HI> Palace. They chiefly addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios</HI> who was near a kin to him, and who earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd us to go thi|ther: We excus'd our &s;elves upon our being in &s;uch Di&s;order, not having &s;lept that Night, and being in an undre&s;s: &s;he or|der'd her Son to go to the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and to beg him to accept our excu&s;es. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> return'd in a moment, attended with abundance of Pages, &s;ome of which brought Umbrellos of Gold and Silver Brocado. He told us that his <HI>Eminence</HI> mightily de&s;ir'd we would go to his Hou&s;e, and that he had &s;hew'd &s;o much concern at our refu&s;al, that indeed he had pro|mis'd to bring us; and thereupon he commanded them to bring Umbrellos to defend us from the Sun, and that they had water'd the place which we mere to cro&s;s from the Church to the Palace. And immediately we &s;py'd two Mules drawing a little Cart, in which there was a Tub full of Water; and we were told that as oft as the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was to come to the Church, it was the Cu&s;tom to water the way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops</HI> Palace is very ancient and large, mo&s;t rich|ly furni&s;h'd, and every way &s;uitable to the Per&s;on that po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es it. We were conducted into a very fine Appartment, where immediately they brought us Chocolate, and afterwards, all &s;orts of Fruits, Wine, Water and other Liquors cool'd with Ice. We were &s;o &s;leepy, that after we had eat a little, we begg'd the Marchionne&s;s <HI>de Palacios</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and to excu&s;e us to him, if we defer'd giving our &s;elves that honour,

And indeed, the young Marchionne&s;s <HI>de la Ro&s;e,</HI> my Kin&s;wo|man and my &s;elf, cho&s;e to go to bed, and in the Evening, we dre&s;t our &s;elves to &s;ee the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios,</HI> who had always been extreamly devoted to her, went to the <HI>Alcacar,</HI> which is the Name of the Ca&s;tle, and made her a vi&s;it whil&s;t we &s;lept; &s;o that &s;he told her, &s;he would give us Audience at eight a Clock in the Evening, and that was the fir&s;t time I was dre&s;t according to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode.</P>
<P>I do not think there's a more trouble&s;ome dre&s;s; ones Shoul|ders mu&s;t be &s;o &s;queez'd, that it hurts one; there's no lifting up ones Arm, hardly can you get it into the Sleeve. I had on a Far|dingal of a dreadful bigne&s;s, (for one mu&s;t wear that in the Queen's Pre&s;ence) I know not what to do with my &s;elf with this &s;trange Invention; there's no &s;itting down in it, and I believe if I &s;hould wear it all my Life, I &s;hould never be recon|cil'd to it. My Head was drea&s;t after the <HI>Melene</HI> fa&s;hion, that is, the Hair all &s;pread over the Neck, and ty'd at the end with &s;ome Non-pareil Ribbon, this is a great deal hotter than a Pa|latine; &s;o that being now in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in <HI>Spain,</HI> you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how I pa&s;s away my time. But this being a ceremonial Dre&s;s of the Head, there was nothing to be omitted upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; be&s;ides, I wore their <HI>Patins</HI> which are fitter to break ones Neck, than to walk with. When we were all in a Condition to appear, for my Kin&s;woman and my Daughter were both al&s;o dre&s;t after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, we were led into a Chamber of State, where the Cardinal came to &s;ee us; his Name is <HI>Don Luis Porto Carrero,</HI> he may be about two and forty years old, he's very civil, is of a &s;weet complai|&s;ant Temper, and hath well learnt the polite Breeding of the Court of <HI>Rome:</HI> He &s;tay'd an hour with us, and afterwards there was &s;erv'd up to us a very plentiful Meal; but every thing was &s;o full of Amber, that I never ta&s;ted any Sawces &s;o rich, and le&s;s plea&s;ant. I fancy'd my &s;elf at this Table, like <HI>Tantalus,</HI> in the mid&s;t of Victuals, and yet &s;tarv'd with hunger, becau&s;e I could not eat; for either all the Meat was perfum'd, or el&s;e full of Saffron, Garlick, Onion, Pepper and Spices: but with &s;earching about, I found &s;ome Jellies and white Meats, which were admirable, and with which I &s;av'd my &s;elf harmle&s;s. There were al&s;o brought to Table a Ham of Bacon, which came from the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and which is better than either tho&s;e they boa&s;t &s;o much of at <HI>Bayonu,</HI> or tho&s;e of <HI>Ments;</HI> but it was &s;pread all over with certain little Comfits, which in <HI>France</HI> we call Non-pariel, the Sugar of which melted in the
<PB N="255" REF="130"> Fat; it was drawn full of Limon-peel, which abated much of its goodne&s;s. The Fruit was the be&s;t and the plea&s;ante&s;t thing one can &s;ee, for whole Trees with their Fruit were Iced over with Sugar after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; you'll ea&s;ily believe the Trees were not very big. There were Orange Trees thus order'd, with little artificial Birds fa&s;tned in them. There were like|wi&s;e Cherry Trees, Rasberry and Go&s;eberry Bu&s;hes, and others &s;et in little Ca&s;es of Silver.</P>
<P>We did not &s;it long at Table, becau&s;e the hour for &s;eeing the Queen was near; we were carry'd thither in Chairs, though it is a pretty di&s;tance, and very much up Hill; for the <HI>Alcacar</HI> is built upon a Rock of a prodigious height, and the Pro&s;pect is admirable. Before the Gate there is a very wide Place, after|wards one comes into a Court an hundred and &s;ixty foot long, and an hundred and thirty broad, adorn'd with two rows of Piazza's, ten rows of the Pillars which made the length, were all of one entire Stone; and the breadth had eight rows of Pil|lars, and this made a fine &s;how. But that which plea&s;es much better, is the Stair-ca&s;e at the bottom of the Court, which is an hundred and thirty foot wide, like the Court. After one has gone up &s;ome &s;teps it parts in two, and to &s;peak the Truth, I believe 'tis one of the faire&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI> We went through a great Gallery, and va&s;t Appartments, but met in them &s;o few People, that it did not look as if one could have met with the Queen-Mother of <HI>Spain</HI> there; &s;he was in a great Hall, who&s;e Windows were all open, and which had a Pro&s;pect to the Val|leys, and the River. The Hangings, Cu&s;hions, Carpets and Ca|nopy were all of gray Cloth; the Queen was &s;tanding and lean|ing upon a Balcony, having in her hand a great pair of Beads. When &s;he &s;aw us, &s;he turn'd towards us, and receiv'd us with a Countenance merry enough. We had the Honour to ki&s;s her Hand, which is little, lean and white: She is very pale, her Complexion pure, her Face a little long and flat, her Looks are agreeable, and her Stature is of a middle &s;ize; &s;he was dre&s;t as all the Widdows in <HI>Spain</HI> are, that is, like a <HI>Nun,</HI> without &s;o much as one Hair appearing; and there are many, (though &s;he's not of that number) that cau&s;e all their Hair to be cut off when they lo&s;e their Husbands, for a greater expre&s;&s;ion of their Grief. I ob&s;erv'd that her Gown was tuck'd up quite round, that &s;o it might be let down as it wears out; yet I do not be|lieve &s;he practi&s;es this, but &s;uch is the fa&s;hion of the Country. She ask'd me how long I had been come from <HI>France,</HI> and I gave her an account; &s;he enquir'd if they di&s;cours'd then of a Marriage between her Son and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle d' Orleance,</HI> and
<PB N="256" REF="131"> I told her no; then &s;he &s;aid &s;he would &s;how me her Picture which was drawn from that the King her Son had, and &s;he bid one of her Ladies, who was an old Duenna, and very ugly, bring it. It was drawn in water Colours, in the bigne&s;s of ones hand, in a Box cover'd with black Sattin, and lin'd with green Velvet. Do you find, &s;ays &s;he, that it is like her? I a&s;|&s;ur'd her that there were not any of her Features; for indeed it &s;eem'd to &s;quint, the Face was awry, and nothing could le&s;s re&s;emble a Prince&s;s &s;o perfect as <HI>Madamoi&s;elle.</HI> She ask'd me whether &s;he was more or el&s;e hand&s;ome than this Picture. I told her, that &s;he was hand&s;omer beyond compari&s;on. <HI>The King my Son then,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>will be plea&s;antly cheated, for he believes this Picture is ju&s;t like her, and no body can be better &s;a|tisfied than he is with her. For my part, her Eyes that look askew were trouble&s;ome to me; but to comfort my &s;elf, I con&s;ider'd that &s;he had a great &s;hare of Wit, and divers other good Qualitles. Do not you remember,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios, to have &s;een my Picture in the late King's Chamber? Yes, Madam,</HI> an|&s;wer'd the Marchione&s;s, <HI>and very well remember al&s;o, that as &s;oon as we &s;aw your Maje&s;ty, we all wondred extreamly, why the Pain|ter would do you &s;o much wrong; that's what I would have &s;aid to you,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>for when I arriv'd here, and ca&s;t my Eyes upon that Picture which they &s;aid was made for me, I in vain try'd to believe it, but I could not do't.</HI> A little &s;he Dwarf, but thick as a Tun, and no taller than a good big Mu&s;hroom, cloth'd all in Gold and Silver Brocade, with long Hair hanging dowh to her Feet, came in, and kneeling before the Queen, ask'd her if &s;he would plea&s;e to have Supper; upon which we offer'd to with|draw, but &s;he told us, we might follow her, and &s;he went into a Parlour all of Marble, &s;he &s;at down to Table all alone, and we all &s;tood round her. Her Maids of Honour, with the <HI>Camera Mayor,</HI> who look'd very &s;ad, came to wait on her. I &s;aw &s;ome of them, which methinks were very hand&s;ome; they talkt to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios,</HI> and told her, that they were hor|ribly tyr'd with that &s;ort of Life, and that they liv'd at <HI>Tolleda,</HI> as if they were in a De&s;art. The&s;e were called <HI>Damas de Pa|lecio,</HI> and they wear <HI>Patins;</HI> but for the little <HI>Menines,</HI> they wear Shooes quite flat; the <HI>Menines</HI> are Children of the highe&s;t Quality, and neither wear Cloak nor Sword.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal Di&s;hes brought before the Queen, the fir&s;t were Melons cool'd with Ice, and &s;ome Sallets and Milk, of which &s;he eat plentifully before &s;he touch'd any of the Fle&s;h, which look'd ill enough. She does not want a Stomach, and &s;he drank a little Wine pure, &s;aying that was to dige&s;t her Fruit:
<PB N="257" REF="131"> When &s;he call'd for Drink, the fir&s;t <HI>Menin</HI> brought her Cup cover'd upon a Salver, and kneeling gave it to the <HI>Camarera,</HI> who al&s;o kneel'd when the Queen took it from her Hands; and on the other &s;ide, a Lady of the Palace pre&s;ented upon Knee a Napkin to the Queen to wipe her Mouth with: She gave &s;ome dry'd Sweet-meats to <HI>Donna Mariguita de Palacios,</HI> and to my Daughter, in &s;aying to them, they mu&s;t not eat much of &s;uch things, becau&s;e they &s;poyl'd the Teeth of young Girls. She ask'd me divers times, how the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Queen did, and how &s;he diverted her &s;elf? She &s;aid, that &s;he had lately &s;ent her &s;ome Boxes of Amber Pa&s;tils, &s;ome Gloves, and &s;ome Cho|colate: She was above an hour and half at Table, &s;peaking little, but &s;eem'd merry enough. We de&s;ired to know her Commands for <HI>Madrid,</HI> whereupon &s;he expre&s;s'd a great deal of Kindne&s;s and Civility, and after that we took our leave of her. It cannot be deny'd, that this Queen has abundance of Under&s;tanding, as well as Courage and Vertue, to take as &s;he does, &s;o tedious a Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that the fir&s;t <HI>Menine</HI> brings the Queens Patins and puts them on; this is &s;o great an Honour in this Country, that they would not change it for the be&s;t place belonging to the Crown. When the Ladies of the Palace mar|ry, and with the Queens con&s;ent, &s;he adds to their Portions fifty thou&s;and Crowns, and commonly &s;ome Government or Vice-Royalty is given to their Husbands.</P>
<P>When we came back to the Cardinal's Hou&s;e, we found a Theater prepar'd in a mighty great Room, and abundance of Ladies on one &s;ide, and Cavalleros on the other; and that which &s;eem'd pretty odd to me, was a Damask Curtain which was drawn all the length of the Room to the very Theater, and &s;o hindred the Men and the Women from &s;eeing one another: They only &s;tay'd for us, to begin the Comedy of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thisbe;</HI> this was a new Play, but the wor&s;t that I have yet &s;een in <HI>Spain.</HI> Afterwards the Comedians danced very well, and the Diver&s;ion la&s;ted till after two a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>There was given a &s;tately Supper in a great Hall, where there were divers Tables; and when the Cardinal had placed us, he went back to the Cavalleros, who had the &s;ame things on their &s;ide as we had: There was an excellent <HI>Italian</HI> Con|&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, for his Eminence had brought with him Mu&s;i|cians from <HI>Rome,</HI> to whom he gave large Pen&s;ions. It was &s;ix a Clock in the Morning before we could retire to our Appart|ment; and as there were divers things for us yet to &s;ee, in&s;tead of going to bed; we went to the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> which they call
<PB N="258" REF="132"> <HI>Secodebet;</HI> the Hou&s;es which environ it are of Brick, and all uniform, with Balconies: It is of a round Figure, and has Pi|azzas about it, under which People walk, and this is a fine Place. We went back to the Ca&s;tle to view it better and more lei&s;urely; The Building is after the <HI>Gothick</HI> fa&s;hion, and very ancient; but there's &s;omething in't that looks &s;o great, that I do not won|der that <HI>Charles</HI> V. had rather have liv'd there, than in any o|ther City under his Obedience. It contains in a &s;quare, four great Appartments with their &s;everal Wings and Pavillions; there's room enough conveniently to lodge the whole Court of a great King. We were &s;hew'd a Machine that was very &s;trange before it was broken; it was to draw up the Water from the <HI>Tagus,</HI> and to make it ri&s;e to the top of the <HI>Alcacar;</HI> the Hou&s;e where it &s;tood is yet whole, though it be &s;everal Ages &s;ince it was built. There's above five hundred &s;teps from it to the River &s;ide; when the Water was come into the Receiver, it ran by certain Channels into all parts of the City where there were Fountains: This was a mighty Conveniency, for now they are forced to draw their Water thirty fathom deep.</P>
<P>We went and heard Ma&s;s in the Church <HI>de Los Reys:</HI> It is fair and large, and all full of Oranges and Pomegranet Trees, Ja&s;&s;emin and Mirtles, that are very high; they are &s;et in Ca&s;es, and are form'd into Walks up to the very high Altar, who&s;e Or|naments are extraordinary rich, &s;o that looking through all the&s;e green Boughs, and the Flowers of different Colours, upon the &s;hining Gold, Silver, Embroidery, and great lighted Candles which adorn the Altar, it &s;eems as if the Rays of the Sun play'd before your Eyes. There are al&s;o &s;ome Cages painted and gilt, and fill'd with Nightingales, Canary Birds and others, which make a charming noi&s;e. I &s;hould be very glad that in <HI>France</HI> they would imitate them in adorning our Churches. The Walls of this Church is all over cover'd on the out&s;ide with the Chains and Irons of the Captives which have been redeem'd out of <HI>Bar|bary.</HI> In this part of the Town I ob&s;erv'd that mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es had upon their Doors a &s;quare piece of Earthen Ware, upon which was &s;et the Angelical Salutation in the&s;e words, <HI>Maria &s;ue concebida &s;in peca lo original.</HI> I was told that the&s;e Hou&s;es belong'd to the Arch-bi&s;hop, and that none but tho&s;e that work in Silk dwell in them, of which there are very many at <HI>Tolleda.</HI> The two &s;tone Bridges cro&s;s the River are very high, broad and long: If they would but take a little pains with the <HI>Tagus,</HI> Boats might come up to the City, this would be a con|&s;iderable Conveniency; but they are naturally too lazy, to con|&s;ider that the Profit and Advantage of a work is to be prefer'd
<PB N="259" REF="132"> before the trouble of undertaking it. We al&s;o &s;aw the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Los Linnos;</HI> that is of Foundlings, and the City-Hou&s;e which is near the Cathedral; and at la&s;t our Curio&s;ity being &s;atisfy'd, we came back to the Archiepi&s;copal Palace, and we went to Bed and laid till Night, when again we had another Fea&s;t as &s;plendid as the former: His Eminence eat with us, and when we had return'd him all due thanks, we &s;et forward towards the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ignarica:</HI> The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Palacios,</HI> with all his Fa|mily, was there waiting for us; &s;o that we were &s;o obligingly receiv'd, that nothing can be added to the good Chear and to the Plea&s;ure, with which we were entertain'd for &s;ix days, ei|ther in Fi&s;hing upon the River <HI>Xarama,</HI> of in Hunting, in Walk|ing, or in common Conver&s;ation: Every one was Emulous to appear good humour'd; and one may &s;ay, that when the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> go &s;o far as to lay a&s;ide their Gravity, and know and love you, they contribute hugely to ea&s;e and recreate the Mind. They become &s;ociable, obliging, earne&s;t to plea&s;e you, and the be&s;t Company in the World. This is what I have found in this little Journey I have made, of which I &s;hould not have given you &s;o particular an Account; but yet I am per&s;waded, Dear Cou&s;in, you de&s;ire it &s;o, and that you &s;et &s;ome value upon my Complai|&s;ance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ceremony of Swearing to the Treaty of Peace con|cluded at <HI>Nimmiguen,</HI> between the Crawns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> was perform'd here the la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> I had a great de&s;ire to have &s;een what pa&s;t then; but as Women are not to be pre&s;ent there, &s;o the <HI>Conne&s;table De Ca&s;tille</HI> promis'd to get us into the <HI>King</HI>'s Chamber, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be gone into the great Hall, Madam <HI>Gueux</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, and Madam <HI>De Chais,</HI> the Envoy of <HI>Holland</HI>'s Lady, were there al&s;o. We went up at a grivate Pair of Stairs, where one of the <HI>Con&s;table</HI>'s Gentlemen waited to receive us, and we tarry'd for &s;ome time in a very fine Clo&s;et full of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Books, well bound and very diverting: There among&s;t others, I found the Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> the famous <HI>Knight of the Manca,</HI> in which
<PB N="260" REF="133"> the plainne&s;s and the &s;ubtilty of the Expre&s;&s;ion, the weight and &s;trength of Proverbs, and that which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>El pico,</HI> that is the &s;martne&s;s and nicety of a Language, appear'd quite otherwi&s;e, then the Tran&s;lations which we have in <HI>French.</HI> I was &s;o pleas'd in reading it, that I hardly thought of &s;ee|ing the Ceremony: It began as &s;oon as the Marquis <HI>De Villars</HI> came, and through a Lattice-window which was open'd, we &s;aw what pa&s;t. The <HI>King</HI> placed him&s;elf at the end of the great Gilt-Hall, which is one of the mo&s;t &s;tately in the Palace; The <HI>Alcove</HI> was &s;pread with a wonderful fine Carpet; the The Throne and the Canopy were embroider'd with Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies, Emeraulds and other precious Stones. Cardinal <HI>Portocarrero</HI> &s;at in a great Chair below the <HI>Alcove,</HI> on the right hand of the Throne; the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> &s;at up|on a Stool; the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;eated on the left hand of the Throne upon a Bench covered with Velvet, and the <HI>Grandees</HI> were placed near the Cardinal; when every body was &s;eated according to their Quality, the <HI>King</HI> came in, and when he was in his Throne, the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> and the <HI>Grandees</HI> &s;et down and cover'd them&s;elves. A Secretary read aloud, the Power which the mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King had &s;ent to his Amba&s;&s;ador. After that, a little Table was brought and &s;et before the <HI>King,</HI> with a Crucifix and a Book of the <HI>E|vangeli&s;ts,</HI> and whil&s;t he held his hand upon it, the <HI>Cardinal</HI> read the Oath, by which he &s;wore to keep the Peace with <HI>France:</HI> There were &s;ome other little Ceremonies, but I did not mind them well enough to be able to give you an Account of 'em. A little after the <HI>King</HI> return'd to his Lodgings, but we were gone out of them before: We &s;tay'd in the &s;ame Clo|&s;et where we &s;topt at fir&s;t: It was &s;o near his Chamber, that we heard him &s;ay, that he was never &s;o hot, and that he would put off his Collar: And indeed, the Sun does &s;hine very hot in this Country: At my fir&s;t coming hither, I was afflicted with a &s;trange Meagrim, and could not imagine the cau&s;e of it; but my Kin&s;woman told me 'twas becau&s;e I wore too much upon my Head, and that if I did not take care I might lo&s;e my &s;ight &s;o; I immediately threw off my Bonnets and my Cornets, and &s;ince that time I have never had any pain in my Head. For my part, I cannot believe that there is in any part of the World more &s;erene Air than there's here: It is &s;o pure, that you can|not perceive &s;o much as one Cloud; and it is affirm'd to me, that even the Weather here in Winter, is like the fine&s;t Wea|ther in any other Country: That which is mo&s;t dangerous here is, a certain Wind <HI>De Galiegue,</HI> which blows off the Mountains
<PB N="261" REF="133"> of the Mountains <HI>Gallicia:</HI> It is not violent, but 'tis &s;o piercing, that it reaches the very Bones, and &s;ometimes cau&s;es a Lamene&s;s in a Leg or an Arm, and often in half the Body, which la&s;ts for ones life: It is more frequent in Summer than in Winter. Stran|gers take it for the We&s;tern Briezes, and are ravi&s;ht when they feel it, but experience convinces them of its Malignity. The Sea&s;ons in <HI>Spain</HI> are much more convenient and plea&s;ant than either in <HI>France, England, Holland,</HI> or <HI>Germany;</HI> For hot to rec|kon that purity of Air, which cannot be imagin'd &s;o fine as 'tis from the Month of <HI>September</HI> to the Month of <HI>June,</HI> it is not &s;o cold, but one can make a &s;hift without fire; and this is the rea&s;on, why there's no Chimneys in any of their Appartments, and that they make u&s;e only of Chafindi&s;hes. But 'tis a great Happine&s;s that Wood being &s;o &s;carce as 'tis in this Country, they have no occa&s;ion for't; It never freezes thicker than the thickne&s;s of two Crowns, and there falls little Snow. But the adjacent Mountains furni&s;h <HI>Madrid</HI> with it all the Year round: The Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> are indeed exce&s;&s;ive hot.</P>
<P>I was lately in a Company where all the Ladies were &s;adly frighted: One of 'em &s;aid, that &s;he had received a Letter from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which advis'd, that a Bell there, which was only rung upon &s;ome publick Calamity, or upon &s;ome occa&s;ion of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, had all alone rung &s;everal times: This Lady came from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and &s;he a&s;&s;ur'd me, that when|ever any Misfortune and Mi&s;ery is to befal <HI>Spain,</HI> or that any of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> is to die, this Bell rings; that for a quar|ter of an hour together the Clapper of the Bell moves with a &s;trange quickne&s;s, and &s;trikes in turning round: I would not believe it, neither do I yet: But all the Company confirm'd what &s;he &s;aid: If it is a Lye, there were above twenty that con|&s;pir'd with her in it. They began to think upon what, and on whom this unhappine&s;s which by this &s;ign is foretold was to fall; and as they are very Super&s;titious, the beautiful Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>De Liche,</HI> encrea&s;t their fears, by telling them, that <HI>Don John</HI> was very &s;ick.</P>
<P>In their deep Mourning, they are attir'd like Fools, but chief|ly on the fir&s;t days; for the Foot-men as well as the Ma&s;ters have long Cloaks trailing, and in&s;tead of Hats, they wear a very high Pa&s;t-board Cap cover'd with Crape; their Hor&s;es are all in black Trappings, and Hou&s;&s;ings which cover their Heads and all their Bodies: Nothing looks uglier; their Coaches are &s;o ill co|ver'd, that the Cloth which covers the Roof, hangs almo&s;t down to the Boots: No body that &s;ees this doleful Equipage but would think, that &s;ome Corps is a carrying to be bury'd; the
<PB N="262" REF="134"> People of Quality wear their Cloaks of black Bays, very thin and rotten, the lea&s;t thing tears it in pieces: And that Mourn|ing is mo&s;t graceful, that is mo&s;t ragged and tatter'd. I have &s;een &s;ome <HI>Cavelleros</HI> which tore their Cloaths on purpo&s;e; and I a&s;&s;ure you, that through &s;ome of their Cloaths, you may &s;ee their Skin as ugly as 'tis to look on: For though their Children when they are young, are as white as Alabla&s;ter, and &s;o pret|ty, that you wou'd take them for Angels, yet it mu&s;t be grant|ed, that as they grow bigger, they alter very &s;trangely; the heat of the Sun roa&s;ts them, the Air tans them, and 'tis ea&s;y to know a <HI>Spaniard</HI> from any other Nation: Their Features are neverthele&s;s regular, but &s;till there wants methinks our Air and Meen as well as our Skin and Complexion.</P>
<P>All the Scholars wear long Robes, with a little Border of Linnen about their Necks in&s;tead of a Collar; they are habitted very like the Je&s;uits; there's of 'em above thirty Years old; they are known to be Students yet by their Habits.</P>
<P>I fancy this City to look like a great Coup, in which they feed Poultry: For really, from the Level of the Street to the fourth Story, one can &s;ee nothing but Lattices who&s;e holes are very &s;mall; and their very Balconies have 'em: There's always to be &s;een &s;ome of the poor confin'd Women &s;tanding behind them, to look upon Pa&s;&s;engers, and when they dare, they open them, and with great delight &s;hew them&s;elves; there's not a Night pa&s;&s;es without four or five hundred Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick, in &s;everal parts of the Town; it's true they are at a moderate rate, and it is &s;ufficient if a Gallant has only his Guittar or his Harp, and &s;ometimes both joyn'd with a Voice hoar&s;e enough to awake the mo&s;t drow&s;y body, and afford 'em the plea&s;ure of a Queen: If either they do not under&s;tand what is mo&s;t excel|lent, or cannot obtain it, they are content with what they can get: I never &s;aw any Virginals or Theorba's here.</P>
<P>In every Street, and at every corner Hou&s;e, there's an Image or Statue of our Lady dre&s;s'd after the Fa&s;hion of the Country; with a Pair of Beads in her Hands, and either a great Wax Candle or a Lamp burning before her: I have &s;een three or four in my Kin&s;woman's Stable, with other pieces of Devotion; for you mu&s;t know, that every Groom will have his Oratory as well as his Ma&s;ter, though perhaps neither one nor t'other often pray there. When one Lady goes to vi&s;it another, if it be in the Night, four Pages comes to receive her with great Flam|boys of white Wax, and in the &s;ame manner conduct her out again, and while &s;he's going into her Chair, they commonly kneel upon one Knee: This is &s;omething more &s;plendid, than

<P>Here are Hou&s;es on purpo&s;e for Women of lewd Lives, like the <HI>Madelonnettes</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> They u&s;e them very &s;everely, and there is not a day pa&s;&s;es that they are not whipt &s;everal times; in a certain time they are releas'd, but come out wor&s;e than they went in, what they &s;uffer'd making them not a bit the better. They live almo&s;t altogether in a particular part of the Town, where vertuous Women never go, but if by chance any one does go that way, they run and pur&s;ue after her, as if &s;he was their Enemy; and if it happens that they are the &s;tronge&s;t, &s;he is &s;ure to be cruelly us'd; and for the <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> they run the Ri&s;que of being torn in pieces as oft as they pa&s;s that way; that is to &s;ay, who &s;hall have 'em: One takes him by the Arm, ano|ther by the Legs, and a third by the Head, and if he grows angry, they altogether fall upon him and rob him, and even &s;trip him of his Cloaths. My Kin&s;woman has a Page who was ignorant of the Tricks of the&s;e wretched Wenches, and went innocently through their Quarters, but they &s;tript him as naked as common Thieves in a Wood could have done; and yet a Man mu&s;t be content with this Treatment, For to whom &s;hall he go for Re&s;titution?</P>
<P>The Bell of <HI>Barcelona</HI> hath been but too true in its Progno|&s;ticks, for <HI>Don John</HI> was the fir&s;t of this Month brought down &s;o very low with his &s;ickne&s;s, that the Phy&s;icians de&s;pair'd of him, and he was advis'd to prepare him&s;elf for Death: He receiv'd the News with &s;o much Tranquility and Re&s;ignation, as very much confirm'd the Belief that &s;everal Per&s;ons had before entertain'd, that he had taken &s;ome private di&s;gu&s;t, which made him rather wi&s;h to die than live: The King came every moment into his Chamber, and &s;pent &s;everal hours at his Bed-&s;ide, notwith&s;tan|ding his earne&s;t Prayers that he would not &s;o expo&s;e him&s;elf to a Feaver: He receiv'd the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Viaticum,</HI> made his Will, and writ a Letter to a Lady who&s;e name I could not learn: He com|manded <HI>Don Antonio Ortis</HI> his chief Secretary to carry it with a little Box lockt, which I &s;aw; it was made of <HI>China</HI> Wood, and light enough to make one think there was in't nothing but Let|ters and perhaps &s;ome Jewels; while he was &s;o dangerou&s;ly &s;ick a Courrier arriv'd with the News of the King's Marriage with <HI>Mademoi&s;elle;</HI> the Joy of which did not only fill the Palace, but all the City &s;hew'd Expre&s;&s;ions of it, for there were over the whole Town Artificial Fire-works and Illuminations for three Days together: The King could not contain him&s;elf, but run into <HI>Don John</HI>'s Chamber, and although he was very drow&s;y and heavy to &s;leep, and wanted re&s;t, yet he awak'd him to tell him
<PB N="264" REF="135"> that the Queen would quickly be here, and intreated him to think of nothing but being well again, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t at her reception. Ah! <HI>Syre,</HI> an&s;wered the Prince to him, <HI>I &s;hall never have that Satisfaction, I &s;hould be content to die, if I had had the Honour to have &s;een her once:</HI> The King fell a weeping, and told him, <HI>That &s;eeing him in that Condition, was the only thing that di|&s;turb'd his Happine&s;s.</HI> There was to have been a Bull-Fea&s;t, but the Prince's &s;ickne&s;s has caus'd it to be put off, and the King would not have &s;uffer'd any Fire-works in the Palace-Court, had not <HI>Don John,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he had a violent pain in his Head, begg'd him to permit them. In fine, the 17th of this Month he dy'd extreamly regretted by &s;ome, and as little by o|thers. This is the fate both of Princes and Favourites, as well as of Per&s;ons that move in an ordinary Sphere; and as his Cre|dit was already declining, and the Courtiers now thought of no|thing el&s;e but the Queen-Mother's Return, and the Arrival of the new Queen, &s;o it is a mighty &s;trange thing to ob&s;erve with what indifference the Sickne&s;s and Death of <HI>Don John</HI> was taken; they did not &s;o much as talk on him the very next day; It &s;eem'd as if he had never been in the World. Alas! Dear Cou&s;in, does not this de&s;erve a little to be reflected on? He govern'd all the Kingdoms of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his very name &s;truck Terror, he caus'd the Queen-Mother to be bani&s;ht; he drove away Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> and <HI>Valenuela,</HI> who were both Favourites, he had for the mo&s;t part a greater Court than the King: And yet four and twenty hours after he was dead, I believe I &s;aw in different pla|ces fifty Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality, which did not &s;o much as &s;peak one word of this poor Prince, notwith&s;tanding divers of them had very great Obligations to him: And yet after all, he had very great per&s;onal Qualifications and Vertues: He was of a middle Stature, and a well &s;hap'd body, his Features were regular, his Eyes black and lively, he had black Hair, a great deal of it, and very long: He was well bred, of a great Wit and Judgment, very generous, brave and beneficent, and had a Ca|pacity for the highe&s;t Affairs. He was not ignorant of any thing that was &s;uitable to his Birth, nor of any of the Arts and Sci|ences. He both &s;poke and writ very well five &s;everal Languages, and under&s;tood more: He was perfectly well read in Hi&s;tory; he could both make and play upon any In&s;trument as well as the be&s;t Ma&s;ter. He under&s;tood how to turn &s;everal things; he could forge Arms, and he delighted much in the Mathematicks; but being call'd to the management of the Government, he was oblig'd to take his Thoughts off all the&s;e Exerci&s;es. The face of things chang'd in a moment, his Eyes were &s;carce clos'd,
<PB N="265" REF="135"> before the King (mov'd only by his own kind and ea&s;ie Nature for the Queen his Mother) run to <HI>Tolleda</HI> to &s;ee her, and to in|treat her to return; &s;he con&s;ented to it with all the Joy &s;he had to &s;ee the King. They wept not a little, while they embrac'd each other, and we &s;aw 'em come back together. All the Per|&s;ons of Quality went to meet their Maje&s;ties, and the People &s;hew'd abundance of Joy. I &s;hould inlarge a great deal more upon this return, did I not intend to be very particular in the Memoirs I am writing.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> laid three days in his Bed of State, and in the &s;ame Cloaths which he had made to go meet the young Queen; after that he was carried to the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> The Funeral had nothing of Greatne&s;s; the Officers of his Hou&s;e, with a very few Friends accompany'd him: He was laid in the little Vault near the <HI>Pan|theon,</HI> which is re&s;erved &s;olely for the Princes and Prince&s;&s;es of the Royal Blood; for there are none bury'd in the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> you mu&s;t know, but Kings, and tho&s;e Queens that have had Chil|dren; tho&s;e that have had none, are bury'd in that particular Vault. In a few days we are to go to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> which will be when the King goes there; but he is &s;o taken up with his young Queen, that he can think of nothing but going towards the Frontiers to meet her. In every place where I come, they are continually ringing it aloud in my Ears, that &s;he'll quickly be Queen of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">d twenty Kingdoms. In all likelyhood there's eleven of them in the <HI>Indies;</HI> for I only know tho&s;e of the old and new <HI>Ca&s;tille, Arragon, Valentia, Navarre, Murcia, Grenada, Andalou&s;ia, Gallicia, Leon,</HI> and the I&s;les <HI>Majorques.</HI> In the&s;e Places there are &s;ome parts of them admirable, upon which it &s;eems as if Heaven had a mind to &s;pread abroad its mo&s;t benign Influences. There are others again &s;o barren, that there is nei|ther Corn, Herbs, Vines, Fruit, Meadows, nor Springs; and of the&s;e one may &s;ay, there's more than of the others. But gene|rally &s;peaking, the Air there is good and whol&s;ome. In certain parts the Heats are exce&s;&s;ive, and in others the Cold and the Winds are in&s;upportable, although 'tis in the &s;ame Sea&s;on. There are a great many Rivers, but that which is pretty &s;ingular, is, that the bigge&s;t of them is not Navigable; particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Tagus, Guadiana, Minchio, Duero, Guadalguiver,</HI> and that of <HI>E|bre;</HI> for either becau&s;e of the Rocks, the falls of Water, the Gulphes, or the Turnings, Ve&s;&s;els cannot pa&s;s upon them, and this is one of the greate&s;t Difficulties of Trade, and which mo&s;t of all hinders tho&s;e things from coming to Cities which there's need of; for if there was an ea&s;ie Communication between them, tho&s;e Places and Towns that want a great many Wares
<PB N="266" REF="136"> and Goods, might be &s;upplyed from tho&s;e that abound, and &s;o every body might be furni&s;h'd with nece&s;&s;ary things at a rea&s;o|nable price; whereas the Charges by Land-carriage being &s;o high, one mu&s;t want divers Conveniences, unle&s;s you are in a Condition to pay three times more for a thing than 'tis worth.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;everal Cities which belong to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the&s;e are e&s;teem'd, either for Beauty or Riches, <HI>viz. Madrid, Seville, Grenada, Valentia, Sarragou&s;a, Tolleda, Vailladolid, Cor|doua, Salamancha, Cadiz, Naples, Milan, Me&s;&s;ina, Palermo, Ca|gliari, Bruxelles, Antwerp, Gand,</HI> and <HI>Mons.</HI> There are a great many others which neverthele&s;s are very con&s;iderable; and &s;everal of the Towns are as big as Cities; but there are not in them tho&s;e multitudes of People, which are both the Riches and Strength of a King. And there are divers Rea&s;ons to be given why there is this defect. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> drove a|way the <HI>Moors</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed the Inqui&s;ition, what through the Puni&s;hments they inflicted upon &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> and the bani&s;hing of others, there dy'd and went out of the Kingdom in a little while, above nine hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons; be&s;ides, the <HI>Indies</HI> draw away abundance; the Unfortunate go there to enrich them&s;elves, and when they have done &s;o, they remain to enjoy the fruit of their Labour, and the Plea&s;ures of the Country. Again, Soldiers are rais'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ent away to Gari&s;on other Cities under the obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">f the King; the&s;e Soldiers marry and &s;ettle in the Places where they happen to be, and never return to tho&s;e from whence they came. Add to this, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman bear but few Children; if they have three 'tis reckon'd abundance: and Strangers do not come to in|habit there, as in other parts of the World, becau&s;e they are not lov'd there, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally <HI>recatados,</HI> that is &s;in|gular, and re&s;erv'd to them&s;elves, and will not be communicative and open with other Nations, which they either envy or &s;corn: And thus having examin'd into all tho&s;e means which help to depopulate the Country under his Catholick Maje&s;ty, one may rather wonder that there are &s;o many People remaining.</P>
<P>There grows but little Corn in <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> it is brought from <HI>Si|cily, France</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and indeed, how &s;hould it grow, un|le&s;s the Earth would produce it of it &s;elf, as the Land of <HI>Pro|mi&s;e</HI> did?

I &s;ay, they having taking up the&s;e vain Conceits of them&s;elves, no wonder if they will neither derogate from the <HI>Gravidad,</HI> nor <HI>Decendentia.</HI> At this rate do they talk, and they will more willingly endure Hunger, and all Severities of Life, than work (&s;ay they) like Mercinaries, which belongs only to Slaves. And thus Pride &s;econded by Sloth, hinder the mo&s;t part of them to &s;ow their Land, unle&s;s &s;ome Strangers come and help them to till their Ground, which by a &s;pecial directi|on and guidance of Providence always happens; Strangers that are more labourious and worldly minded, being mov'd thither by the gain they find; &s;o that you &s;hall have a &s;orry Pea&s;ant &s;itting in his Chair reading of a mouldy <HI>Romance,</HI> whil&s;t the&s;e Strangers are working for him, in order to carry away his Money.</P>
<P>There's no Oats to be &s;een, Hay is &s;carce, their Hor&s;es and Mules eat Barley in the Straw chopt &s;mall. The Hills and Mountains in the&s;e Kingdoms I &s;peak of, are of &s;uch a prodi|gious height and length, that I do not believe there's the like in any other part of the World; one meets with &s;ome of an hun|dred Leagues in length, which joyn one to another in a con|tinu'd Chain, and which without Hyperbole, are higher than the Clouds, they are called <HI>Sierras,</HI> among&s;t which are reckon'd the Mountains of <HI>Pyrenea, Granada, A&s;tura, Alcantara, Morena, Tol|leda, Doua, Molina</HI> and <HI>Albanera.</HI> The&s;e Hills render the way &s;o very difficult, that no Waggons can pa&s;s, which obliges them to carry all upon Mules, who are &s;o &s;ure footed, that in two hundred Leagues continual travelling among&s;t Rocks, and great Flint Stones, they will not &s;o much as once &s;tumble.</P>

I am willing to believe that there are a few that have &s;ome compunction, but in my Con&s;cience, I doubt far le&s;s than they make &s;hew of: They never leave off their <HI>Swords,</HI> either when they go to Confe&s;&s;ion or the Sacrament; they &s;ay, they wear 'em to defend <HI>Religion;</HI> and in the Morning before they put them on, they ki&s;s 'em and make the &s;ign of the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> with them; they pay an exce&s;&s;ive Devotion to the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin,</HI> and put an extraordinary confidence in her; there's hardly any Man that does not wear a <HI>Scapular</HI> or &s;ome em|broider'd <HI>Image</HI> that hath toucht &s;ome of tho&s;e that are held to be <HI>miraculous;</HI> and th&ocirc; otherwi&s;e they do not lead lives very regular, yet they will not forbear praying to <HI>her</HI> with a tru&s;t, that 'tis <HI>&s;he</HI> that mu&s;t protect and &s;ave 'em from the greate&s;t Evils; they are very charitable, not only upon the account of the Merits by Alms Deeds, but al&s;o by a natural Inclination they have to give, and a real pain they endure if either through Poverty, or for any other rea&s;on they are forc'd to refu&s;e any thing that is askt them; they have al&s;o another good Quality, which is never to for&s;ake their Friend in Sickne&s;s; their care and their concern is far greater in &s;uch a time, when doubtle&s;s the Pre&s;ence as well as the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend is mo&s;t want|ed: So that Per&s;ons that do not &s;ee one another four times in a Year, yet are con&s;tant in their vi&s;it three or four time every day; when one is under any affliction, and that they can become u&s;eful to each other: But as &s;oon as they are well, they re&s;ume the &s;ame way of living they us'd before they were &s;ick.</P>

Do ye think, for in&s;tance, that you ought le&s;s to wonder at that <HI>Lake</HI> which is near <HI>Guadalajara</HI> in <HI>Anda|lou&s;ia,</HI> which foretells approaching Tempe&s;t, by mo&s;t horrid bellowing and roaring, that is heard above twenty thou&s;and Paces di&s;tance? and what do ye &s;ay of that other <HI>Lake</HI> which is found upon the very top of the Mountain <HI>Clavio,</HI> in the <HI>Comte</HI> of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> near to <HI>Perpignan?</HI> It is extream deep; there's in't Fi&s;hes, both for bigne&s;s and &s;hape that are mon&s;trous; when a Stone is thrown into it, there are Vapours &s;een to come out with a mighty noi&s;e, and to a&s;cend into the Air, and there convert into the Clouds, which produce mo&s;t ter|rible Storms, accompany'd with Thunder, Lightning and Hail. Is it not likewi&s;e true, continu'd he, in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Don Frederick,</HI> that near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gracimanos,</HI> in a Cavern which is call'd <HI>Judea,</HI> not far from the Bridge <HI>Talayredas,</HI> there's a Spring who&s;e Water freezes as it drops, and grows &s;o hard, that it becomes a perfect Stone, which cannot ea&s;ily be broken, and with which in that Country they build fine Hou&s;es? You have a good Stock of Examples, &s;aid <HI>Don Fre|derick,</HI> but if you will, I'll furni&s;h ye with &s;ome others for your purpo&s;e. Do ye remember the Mountain of <HI>Monrayo</HI> in <HI>Arragon;</HI> If the &s;heep feed upon't before the &s;un ri&s;e they die, but if they are &s;ick, and feed there after the Sun is up they are cur'd. I mu&s;t not forget neither the Spring in the I&s;le of <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> which is dry when 'tis high Water, and runs when the Tide ebbs: You &s;hall not be the only Per&s;on, &s;aid I, in inter|rupting him, that &s;hall &s;econd <HI>Don Fernand</HI> in the&s;e &s;orts of Re|lations, I mu&s;t tell him, that in the &s;ame <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there's a certain Plant which withers upon the fir&s;t appearance of the Sun, and grows green again as &s;oon as Night comes. <HI>Ah! pret|ty Plant,</HI> cries <HI>Don Fernand</HI> in Laughing, <HI>Well, I have enough now to be reveng'd for all the &s;port you have made at my Stories for this Hour together; I declare open War again&s;t you about this Plant, and if you do not &s;end for one hither, I know what I'll believe:</HI> The facetious Humour of this <HI>Cavallero</HI> made us very plea&s;antly pa&s;s the Evening: but we were interrupted by my Kin&s;woman, who return'd out of the City, where &s;he had &s;pent &s;ome part of the day at her Lawyers, who was at the point of Death; he is very old, and a very knowing Man in his Profe&s;&s;ion: She told us, that all his Children &s;tood round his Bed, and that the only thing which he recommended to 'em, was always to pre&s;erve a
<PB N="271" REF="138"> good &s;tock of <HI>Gravity;</HI> and after he had ble&s;t them, &s;ays he to 'em, what greater good can I now wi&s;h you, my dear Chidren, than to lead your whole Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and never to quit this <HI>Earthly Paradice,</HI> but for the <HI>Heavenly:</HI> This may &s;hew con|tinu'd &s;he, the &s;trange Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have for <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the Happine&s;s they enjoy in that Court: For my part, &s;aid I, in interrupting her, I am per&s;waded there's a|bundance of Vanity in that fondne&s;s that they expre&s;s for their own Nation, for certainly they have too much Sen&s;e not to know, that there are many other Countries far more agreeable: It is not true, &s;aid I, in addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> that th&ocirc; you will not &s;ay as I &s;ay, that you have the &s;ame thoughts? what my thoughts are, &s;aid he in &s;miling, is no rule for other folks; I mu&s;t tell ye, that &s;ince my return, I am upbraided by every body with being no longer a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> But certain it is, that People being &s;o bewitcht with the Delights and Charms of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and not having power to for&s;ake it in any &s;ea&s;on of the Year, no body has thought of building pretty Hou&s;es in the Country whither they might &s;ometimes retire; &s;o that all adja|cent parts about the City, which &s;hould be fill'd with delicious Gardens and &s;plendid Seats look like &s;o many little De&s;erts, and this is the rea&s;on al&s;o, why the City in Summer as well as in Win|ter, is equally crowded with People: Hereupon my Kin&s;woman &s;aid, &s;he would have me to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> and that it was agreed on by the Marchione&s;&s;es of <HI>Palacios</HI> and <HI>La Ro&s;a,</HI> to go two days hence; the Lady your Mother, added &s;he, in &s;peaking to <HI>Don Fernand</HI> de&s;igns you to make one, and I indeed to &s;ecure <HI>Don Frederick,</HI> for another, they both declar'd, that with abun|dance of Joy, they would go this little Journey; and indeed, the next day we went to ki&s;s <HI>Queen Mothers</HI> hand, and to know her commands for the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> for you mu&s;t know, 'tis the Cu&s;tom, when one is to go out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> fir&s;t to pay their re|&s;pects to the <HI>Queen.</HI> But we had not &s;een her &s;ince her Return. &s;he lookt merrier than &s;he did at <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and told us, &s;he did not think of coming back &s;o &s;oon to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that now it &s;eem'd, as if &s;he had never been out of it. There was brought before her a <HI>Gyant-Woman</HI> that came from the <HI>Indies:</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her, &s;he caus'd her to be taken away, &s;he was &s;o af|frighted at her. Her Ladies would make this <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> dance, who held in each hand two <HI>She Dwarfs</HI> that play'd upon the Ca&s;tinets and the <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> Drum, all this was ugly in the highe&s;t degree. My Kin&s;woman ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Queen Mothers</HI> Apartment; things which had been <HI>Don John's</HI> among&s;t others an admira|ble Pendulum Clock, all &s;et with Diamonds, he made her in
<PB N="272" REF="139"> part, his Heir, in all likelyhood 'twas to te&s;tifie his regret for having troubled and vex'd her.</P>
<P>The Journey to the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> was perform'd with all imagina|ble Satisfaction, the de&s;ire of entertaining you with it, hindred me from &s;ending you the Letter I begun before I went thither; the &s;ame Ladies that went to <HI>Arranjus</HI> and <HI>Tolleda,</HI> were very glad to embrace the Occa&s;ion of taking the Air a little in &s;o fine a Sea&s;on; and we went fir&s;t to the <HI>Pardo,</HI> which is a Royal Hou&s;e, the Building like the re&s;t in <HI>Spain</HI> is hand&s;om enough, that is, it con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;quare of foul &s;everal Appartments &s;eparated by Gal|leries of Communication, which are &s;upported with Pillars; the Forniture of it, is not indeed &s;tately, but there are good Pictures, among&s;t others, tho&s;e of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> in odd &s;orts of Dre&s;|&s;es.</P>
<P>We were &s;hew'd a little Clo&s;et, which the late King us'd to call his Beloved, becau&s;e in it he was wont &s;ometimes to enter|tain him&s;elf with his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; this Prince who was &s;eeming|ly &s;o cold and grave, that he was hardly ever &s;een to laugh, was really the mo&s;t amorous and the plea&s;ante&s;t of Men. There is a Garden well enough kept, and a Park of a con&s;iderable extent, whither the King frequently goes to hunt; we were afterwards at a Convent of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> which &s;tands on the top of a Hill; this is a Place of great Devotion, becau&s;e of a Crucifix which it &s;eems was taken from the true Cro&s;s, and which often works Miracles: After we had &s;aid our Prayers there, we de|&s;cended on the other &s;ide of the Hill, to a certain Hermitage where there was a Reclu&s;e, that would neither &s;ee us, nor &s;peak to us; but he threw a Ticket to us through his Grate, in which we found it writ, that he would recommend us to God. We were all extream weary, for we were forced to walk afoot up the Hill, and it was very hot Weather; we perceiv'd in the bottom of the Hill a very little Cottage by the &s;ide of a Brook, which runs among&s;t Willow Trees; we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e that way, and when we were yet a great way off, we could &s;ee a Man and a Woman very well dre&s;t, ri&s;e up nimbly from the foot of a Tree where they were &s;ett, and run into that Cottage and &s;hut the Door as ha&s;tily as if they had taken us for thieves; but doubtle&s;s it was fear of being known, which made them avoid us; we went to the Place they had left; being &s;ett on the Gra&s;s, we fell to eating &s;ome Fruit we brought with us; we were &s;o nigh this little Hou&s;e, that they could ea&s;ily &s;ee through their Win|dows what we were doing; there came out a very pretty Coun|try La&s;s, and with a Sea-Ru&s;h Basket addre&s;t her &s;elf to us, and kneeling, begg'd &s;ome of the Fruit of our Collation for a Big-belly'd
<PB N="273" REF="139"> Woman, that would die if we refu&s;ed her. Immediate|ly we &s;ent her &s;ome of the faire&s;t, and quickly after the &s;ame young Girl came again with a Gold Snuff-box, and told us the <HI>Senora</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;ita,</HI> that is the Lady of the little Hou&s;e, in|treated us to accept of &s;ome Snuff for an Acknowledgment of the Favour we had done her. It is the Fa&s;hion here to pre&s;ent Snuff when they have a mind to expre&s;s their Friend&s;hip; we &s;tay'd &s;o long by the Water-&s;ide, that we re&s;olved to go no further that the <HI>Carcuela,</HI> which is another of the King's Hou|&s;es, but not &s;o hand&s;om as the <HI>Pardo,</HI> and &s;o neglected, that there's nothing worth commending, but the Waters; we were ill enough lodg'd there, though we laid in the very &s;ame Beds his Maje&s;ty did; and we were very lucky in taking along with us all Nece&s;&s;aries for Supper. After that we went into the Gardens, which are in bad Order, the Fountains run Day and Night, the Water there is &s;o good and in &s;uch plenty, that for as little almo&s;t as one would de&s;ire, it might be made as plea|&s;ant a Dwelling as any is in the World. But 'tis not the Cu&s;tom in this Country, from the King to private Per&s;ons, to keep &s;e|veral Country Hou&s;es in good Repair, they let them go to ruin, for want of &s;ome very &s;mall Reparations. Our Beds were &s;o ill, that we were not loath to leave them early the next Morning to go to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> We went by <HI>Monareco,</HI> where the Woods begin, and a little further is the Park which belongs to the Con|vent of the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> For in effect it is one which <HI>Philip</HI> the II. built among the Mountains, that &s;o he might the more ea&s;ily get the Stone which he needed, of which there is &s;uch a prodigious Quantity, that without &s;eeing it, one cannot conceive it, and certainly it is one of the va&s;te&s;t Buildings we have in <HI>Europe:</HI> We went up to it through a very long Walk of Elm Trees, which are planted in four Rows, the great Gate is &s;tately adorn'd with divers Marble Pillars rais'd one upon another, till they reach up to the Statue of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> which &s;tands on the top; the King's Arms are cut upon a certain Stone which is call'd the Thunder-Stone, and is brought from <HI>Arabia,</HI> the cutting of which co&s;t three&s;core thou&s;and Crowns. It is ea&s;ie to believe, that having been at &s;o con&s;iderable a Charge for a thing &s;o little u&s;eful, they would not &s;pare any Co&s;t for others which might be nece&s;&s;ary and contribute to the Beauty of the Place. It is a great Square Pile of Building; but beyond the Square there runs out a Length, which contains the Buildings of the En|trance, and are contriv'd to repre&s;ent the Form of the <HI>Gridiron</HI> on which St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> (who is the Patron of the Mona&s;try) &s;uffer'd Martyrdom. It is built according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order,
<PB N="274" REF="140"> and very plain; the Square is divided in the middle, and one of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions which looks upon the Order, opens it &s;elf both ways into four other le&s;&s;er Squares, which are four Cloy|&s;ters built al&s;o according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, and who &s;ees one of them, &s;ees all the re&s;t; the Building has nothing in it, either as to its De&s;ign or Architecture, that is extraordinary; that which is to be admir'd, is the Va&s;tne&s;s of it, being Three hun|dred and eighty Paces in the Square; for be&s;ides tho&s;e four Cloy&s;ters I have mentioned, the other Divi&s;ion of the Square, &s;ubdivided into two, makes two other Piles of Building, one of which is, the King's Quarters, and the other is the Colledge; for there are in it abundance of Pen&s;ioners, whom the King maintains to &s;tudy: The Friars that live in it are <HI>Hieronomites;</HI> this Order is unknown in <HI>France,</HI> and it is aboli&s;ht in <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e a certain <HI>Hieronimite</HI> Fryar attempted at <HI>Milan</HI> the Life of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo:</HI> But he did not hurt him, though he &s;hot at him, and the Bullets pierced his Pontifical Habit; but neverthele&s;s this Order is here in great E&s;teem; there are three hundred Monks in the Convent of the <HI>E&s;curial;</HI> they live much after the &s;ame way of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> they &s;peak little, and pray much, and Women never come into their Church, but be|&s;ides they ought to &s;tudy and preach.</P>
<P>But there's another thing yet, which makes this Building con|&s;iderable, and that is, the nature of the Stone of which it is built. It was taken out of the neighbouring Quarries; it is of a grayi&s;h colour; the &s;harpe&s;t Air and &s;evere&s;t Weather makes no impre&s;&s;ion on't, it does not &s;oil or grow dirty, but con&s;tant|ly pre&s;erves that colour it had when it was taken up. <HI>Philip</HI> II. was two and twenty years in building it, he enjoyed it thir|teen, and then dy'd in't. This Structure co&s;t him &s;ix Millions of Gold. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. added the <HI>Pantheon</HI> to it, that is to &s;ay a <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> like the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> contriv'd under the great Altar of the Church, all of Marble, Ja&s;per and Porphiry, in which there are &s;ix and twenty mo&s;t &s;tately Tombs incha&s;ed in the Walls; and one goes down into it by a pair of Stairs all of Ja&s;per. I fancy'd my &s;elf de&s;cending into &s;ome of tho&s;e en|chaunted places which our Romances and Books of Chevalry talk of. The Tabernacle, the Architecture of the Altar, the &s;teps by which one a&s;cends to it, the Pyx or Box in which the Ho&s;t is kept, and made all of one &s;ingle Agat, are &s;o many Wonders. The Riches that are there, in precious Stones and Gold, is in|credible. One &s;ingle Cupboard of Relicks (for there are four in the four Chappels of the Church) infinitely exceeds the Trea|&s;ure of St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s at <HI>Venice.</HI> The Ornaments of the Church
<PB N="275" REF="140"> are imbroider'd with Pearls and precious Stones; and &s;o are the Chalices and Ve&s;&s;els of precious Stones. The Candle&s;ticks and the Lamps are of pure Gold. There are forty little Chappels, and as many Altars, upon which are put every day forty &s;everal Cloaths and Attires. The forepart of the great Altar is com|pos'd of four Ranks of Ja&s;per Pillars, and one goes up to the Altar by &s;eventeen Steps of Porphiry Stone. The Tabernacle is beautify'd with &s;everal Pillars of Agat, and divers curious Figures of Metal and Chry&s;tal. One can &s;ee nothing about the Tabernacle but Gold, Azur Stone, and other Stones &s;o tran&s;pa|rent, that through them the Sacrament (which is kept in an A|gat Ve&s;&s;el) is ea&s;ily perceiv'd. This Tabernacle is e&s;teem'd at a Million of Crowns. There are eight pair of Organs, the Chairs or Seats in the Quire are made of rare Wood, which comes from the <HI>Indies,</HI> curiou&s;ly wrought after the pattern of tho&s;e of St. <HI>Dominick</HI> at <HI>Boulogne.</HI> The Cloy&s;ters of the Mona&s;tery are ex|tream fine; in the middle there's a Flower Garden, and a Chap|pel which opens four ways, who&s;e Roof is &s;upported with Por|phiry Pillars, between which there are Niches, in which are pla|ced the four Evangeli&s;ts with an Angel, and the &s;everal Crea|tures made of white Marble bigger than Nature, who throw out Torrents of Water into Marble Ba&s;ins. The Chappel is arch'd with curious Architecture, and pav'd with black and white Mar|ble. There are divers Pictures of an ine&s;timable value, and in the Chapter-Room, which is very large, there is be&s;ides mo&s;t excellent Pictures, two Ba&s;s-Reliefs all of Agat, two foot and a half long, which cannot be valued. As to the Church, it has nothing extraordinary in its Structure; it is bigger than that of the Je&s;uits in St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Street at <HI>Paris,</HI> but of the &s;ame form, except that like their Hou&s;e, it is of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. <HI>Bra|manto</HI> the famous <HI>Italian</HI> Architect, drew the Model and De|&s;ign of it. The King and Queen's Appartments are not &s;tately; but <HI>Philip</HI> II. intended this only for a Hou&s;e of Prayer and Re|tirement, the Church and the Library were the things he took mo&s;t care to adorn. <HI>Titian</HI> the famous Painter, and divers o|thers be&s;ides, have exhau&s;ted all their Art and Skill in curiou&s;ly painting the Galleries of the Library, which indeed are admira|ble, not only for the excellent Painting, but for a hundred thou|&s;and Volumes that are there, without reckoning the Original Manu&s;cripts of &s;everal Fathers and Doctors of the Church, which are delicately bound and gilt. You'll ea&s;ily gue&s;s at the bigne&s;s of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> when I have told you that there are in it, &s;even|teen Cloy&s;ters, two and twenty Courts, eleven thou&s;and Win|dows, above eight hundred Pillars, and an infinite number of
<PB N="276" REF="141"> Parlours, Halls and Chambers. A little after the Death of <HI>Phi|lip</HI> II. there was taken from the Fryars of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> a certain E&s;tate in Lands (call'd <HI>Campillo</HI>) which the late King had given them; and was worth eighteen thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per Annum,</HI> and this was done by virtue of a Clau&s;e in his Will, by which he revok'd all the immen&s;e Donations, which is his Life time he had given.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bragance</HI> being at Court in King <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|cond's time, he had a mind they &s;hould go with him to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> that he might &s;ee that &s;tately Pile of Building. And as he that had the care of &s;hewing it to him, told him, It was built in performance of a Vow which <HI>Philip</HI> II. made at the Battel of St. <HI>Quintin,</HI> the Duke reply'd, <HI>He that made &s;o great a Vow, mu&s;t needs have a great Terror upon him.</HI> And now in mentioning this King, I remember to have heard, that <HI>Charles</HI> V. recommended to him the pre&s;ervation of the three Keys of <HI>Spain.</HI> The&s;e were, the <HI>Streights-mouth, Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Cadiz.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> have the fir&s;t, the <HI>Dutch</HI> the &s;econd, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the la&s;t, but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;oon recover'd it from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;curial</HI> is built upon a de&s;cent of &s;ome Rocks in a de|&s;ert and barren Place, and environ'd with Hills; the Village &s;tands below it, and has but few Hou&s;es in't; it's in a manner always cold Weather there. The extent of the Gardens and the Park is a prodigious thing to &s;ee, in which one meets with Woods, Plains, and a va&s;t Hou&s;e in the mid&s;t, in which the Keepers lodge; it abounds with all &s;orts of Deer and Fowl.</P>
<P>After having &s;een a Place which &s;o highly de&s;erves our admi|ration, we all left it; and as we had vi&s;ited the Royal Hou&s;es of <HI>Pardo</HI> and <HI>Carcuela,</HI> we return'd over the Mountains, which is a nearer way, but very trouble&s;ome. We came by <HI>Colmenar,</HI> and coa&s;ting along the little River of <HI>Guadarama,</HI> we pa&s;t through <HI>Rozas</HI> and <HI>Aravac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where we learnt that the Queen's Hou&s;hold were ju&s;t going away to meet her upon the Frontier. We immediately went to the Palace to bid adiew to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and the other Ladies. The King had made them all be mounted, that he might &s;ee after what manner they would be on the day of her Entry; for this rea&s;on all the Gardens, and Doors every way were kept clo&s;e &s;hut and guarded, and no Man was to enter there. The young Court Ladies lookt well enough, but good God! what figures were the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria d' Alarcon,</HI> who were the Governantes of the Queen's Maids; they rid every one upon a Mule &s;hod with Silver, and all friz'd
<PB N="277" REF="141"> with a large hou&s;ing of black Velvet, like that the Phy&s;icians in <HI>Paris</HI> ride with upon their Hor&s;es. The&s;e Ladies, dre&s;t like Widdows, (which I have already de&s;crib'd to you) very old and ugly, with moro&s;e and imperious Looks, wore broad Hats, ty'd with &s;trings under their Chins; and twenty Gentlemen which walkt a foot by their &s;ides, held them up, le&s;t they &s;hould fall. They would never have &s;uffer'd the&s;e Men to have touch'd them in that manner, had not they fear'd breaking their Necks. For you mu&s;t know, dear Cou&s;in, that though every Lady has two Gentlemen U&s;hers, and that they go with them where ever they go, yet they never give them their Hand. They walk by their &s;ides, and pre&s;ent to them their Elbows wrapt in their Cloaks, which makes their Arms look mon&s;trous thick. The Ladies do not come near them; but that which is yet more &s;trange, if the Queen in walking &s;hould happen to fall, unle&s;s her Ladies were near her to help her up, though there were an hundred Gentlemen there, &s;he mu&s;t be pleas'd, either to ri&s;e by her &s;elf, or lie all day upon the Ground, for none dare take her up.</P>
<P>We &s;pent part of the Afternoon in looking at the&s;e Ladies; the Equipage they had was indeed very rich, but very poorly and dully contriv'd. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> had alone, &s;ix Litters of Velvet of various colours, and all embroider'd, and forty Mules, who&s;e hou&s;&s;ings were as co&s;tly as ever I &s;aw any. You will not hear from me again, dear Cou&s;in, before the Queen is come hither. While the King is gone to meet her, and the whole Court is ab&s;ent, my Kin&s;woman will go into <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he has there. I might &s;end you a &s;hort Relation of our little Journey, if I could be a&s;&s;ur'd it would plea&s;e you. I mo&s;t heartily embrace you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Court is return'd, and in my Memoirs you'll find, dear Cou&s;in, the particulars of the Queen's Journey. The King and &s;he were both together in one Coach, and the Curtains being all open, I &s;aw her at her arrival here: She was dre&s;t af|ter
<PB N="278" REF="142"> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> way, and I did not think that &s;he lookt le&s;s hand|&s;ome in this, than in her <HI>French</HI> Garbe; but the King was dre&s;t <HI>a-la-Schomberg,</HI> which is the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> habit for the Country, and 'tis almo&s;t like the <HI>French.</HI> I have heard it told, how &s;trangely the Queen was &s;urpris'd the fir&s;t time &s;he had the Honour to &s;ee him; he had on a clo&s;e body'd Coat of grey <HI>Barragon,</HI> very &s;hort and wide, Velvet Breeches, Stockings of <HI>Pelo,</HI> that is, raw Silk, which they work &s;o very loo&s;e, that their Skin appears through them; this Silk is as &s;mall as a Hair, and though they be very &s;trait, yet the King pulls them on at once, and &s;o he'll tear &s;ome|times twenty pair one after another. He had al&s;o a very fine Cravat, which the Queen &s;ent him, but it was ty'd a little too loo&s;e: His Hair was put behind his Ears, and he wore a grey Hat. All the Journey, which was very long, they &s;at clo&s;e to each other in a large Coach, and &s;eldom could under&s;tand one another but by &s;ome certain &s;igns, for the King cannot &s;peak a word of <HI>French,</HI> and the Queen could &s;peak but very little <HI>Spa|ni&s;h.</HI> Upon their arrival at <HI>Madrid,</HI> they went to &s;ing <HI>Te Deum</HI> at our Lady <HI>d' Atocha,</HI> attended by all the Per&s;ons of Quality, and a multitude of the People, that made the Air re&s;ound with Ac|clamations of Joy. Afterwards their Maje&s;ties went to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> becau&s;e the Appartments in the Palace were not yet ready, and that the Queen was not to remain there till &s;he had made her Entry. This time mu&s;t needs have been very tedi|ous to her, for &s;he &s;aw no body but the <HI>Camerera Mayor</HI> and her Ladies. She's forc'd to lead a Life &s;o much again&s;t her Incli|nations, that &s;he has need of all that Di&s;cretion and Sweetne&s;s of Temper &s;he's po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of to be able to endure it. She has not &s;o much as the Liberty to &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; to be &s;hort, 'tis a perpetual Torment. All the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies love her dearly, and among&s;t them&s;elves pitty her.</P>
<P>I was &s;ometime ago at the Counte&s;s of <HI>Villambro&s;a</HI>'s, and in a great deal of Company. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Fuente</HI> came in there, and as they are extream &s;uper&s;titious in this Country, &s;o &s;he told them, like one affrighted, that being with the Queen, who looking her &s;elf in a great Gla&s;s, and laying her hand gent|ly upon't, it crackt from top to bottom; and that the Queen be|held it without being in the lea&s;t mov'd, but even laught at the Con&s;ternation that all the Ladies about here were in, telling them, it betray'd a weakne&s;s of Mind to take &s;uch notice of things and Accidents as might proceed from natural Cau&s;es. They di&s;cours'd and argued a great while upon this matter, and with deep &s;ighs &s;aid, that their Queen would not live long.
<PB N="279" REF="142"> She al&s;o told us, that the <HI>Queen</HI> was much more di&s;turb'd at the incivility of the <HI>Camerera Mayor,</HI> who &s;eeing &s;ome of her Hairs out of place on her Forehead, &s;pit on her fingers to lay them &s;mooth; upon which the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;tay'd her Arm, telling her in a Maje&s;tick way, that the be&s;t E&s;&s;ence there, was not too good, and that taking her Handkerchief, &s;he was a great while a cleaning that part of her Hair which this piece of Antiquity had &s;o unhand&s;omly wet. It is no uncommon thing here, to wet ones head all over, the better to &s;mooth and make the Hair &s;hine, the fir&s;t time my Head was dre&s;t after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode. one of my Relation's Women undertook this curious piece of work, &s;he was no le&s;s than three hours tugging and pulling my Head, and finding that my Hair, which is naturally curling, would not comply, without &s;aying a word to me, &s;he dipt a great Spunge twice in a Ba&s;on of Water, and baptiz'd me &s;o hand&s;omly, that I was laid up with a Cold for a Month.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Queen,</HI> it would draw pitty from one to &s;ee how this <HI>Camerera</HI> treats her; I am well a&s;&s;ur'd, that &s;he neither &s;uffers her to have &s;o much as a &s;ingle Hair curl'd, nor to come near her Chamber Windows, nor to &s;peak to any body; and yet the <HI>King</HI> loves the <HI>Queen</HI> with all his Heart, and for the mo&s;t part eats with her, and that without Ceremony; &s;o that very often when the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> are laying the Cloth, the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> will divert them&s;elves in helping them, one will lay the Cloth, and t'other a Napkin: The <HI>Queen</HI> has her Meat dre&s;t after the <HI>French</HI> way, and the <HI>King</HI> his after the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h.</HI> He has a Woman Cook to dre&s;s all his Victuals, but the <HI>Queen</HI> endeavours to bring him to like the <HI>Ragous</HI> that are made for her, but he cannot abide them. But now you mu&s;t not im|agin, that their <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> are &s;urrounded with their <HI>Courtiers</HI> when they are at Dinner, at the mo&s;t, there's only &s;ome <HI>Ladies</HI> of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> a few <HI>Menins,</HI> but a great many Male and Fe|male <HI>Dwarfs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> made her Entry the 13th of <HI>January;</HI> after all the Pa&s;&s;ages and Avenues of the great Road which leads to <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> were &s;topt, and all Coaches forbid to come that way, there was a <HI>Triumphal Arch</HI> built, and the <HI>Queen</HI> painted upon't. It was al&s;o cover'd with divers Garlands, and had &s;everal Em|blems and other things painted; it was &s;et in the way by which the <HI>Queen</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s to go into <HI>Madrid;</HI> on each &s;ide there was a &s;ort of a Gallery which had places contriv'd in them, to &s;hew the Arms of the &s;everal Kingdoms under the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion, joyning one to another, by certain Pillars which &s;upported &s;ome gilt Statues, every one of which repre&s;ented Crowns and In|&s;criptions
<PB N="280" REF="143"> which had relation to tho&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>This Gallery reach'd to the Triumphal Gate on the great Road, which was very rich and adorn'd with &s;everal Statues; where likewi&s;e there were four beautiful and young Maids dre&s;t like <HI>Nymphs</HI> waiting for the Queen, and holding in their hands Baskets of Flowers, ready to &s;trow them on the Ground as &s;he pa&s;t; hardly was one out of this Gate or Arch but a &s;econd ap|pear'd, and &s;o for a great way one after another was &s;een. The&s;e were adorn'd with the <HI>King's Council,</HI> that of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> the <HI>Council</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> and other Places, under &s;o many gilt Statues; that of Ju&s;tice was higher rais'd then all the re&s;t. A little further was repre&s;ented the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> accompany'd with the <HI>Law, Re|wards, Protection</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI> The Temple of <HI>Faith</HI> was exhibited in a Picture, <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> open'd the Gate, and <HI>Joy</HI> came forth to receive the new <HI>Queen.</HI> There was be&s;ides, a Picture which &s;hew'd the Reception <HI>Solomon</HI> gave the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> and another where <HI>Deborah</HI> was giving of Laws to her People. There were al&s;o the Statues of <HI>Ceres, A&s;trea, &V;nion, Vertue, Life, Safety, Time,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Tranquility, Peace, Great|ne&s;s, Re&s;t Themis,</HI> and <HI>Liberality.</HI> Among&s;t all the Paintings I took notice of, that where <HI>Aeneas</HI> is de&s;cending into Hell; <HI>Cerberus</HI> chain'd by the <HI>Sybile,</HI> the <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields,</HI> where <HI>An|chi&s;es</HI> &s;hew'd his Son who &s;hould &s;ucceed him in his Po&s;terity. The re&s;t were fill'd with an infinite number of <HI>Hierogliphicks.</HI> The Queen &s;topt at the third Arch, which was over again&s;t a very fine <HI>Parterre</HI> in her way; in it were falls of Water, Grot|tas, Fountains and white Marble Statues. Nothing could be more plea&s;ant than this Garden: It belong'd to the <HI>Fryars</HI> of St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Paulo,</HI> who built it. The fourth Gate was in the middle of the Place call'd <HI>Del Sol;</HI> it was not le&s;s glorious than the others by the Gold, Pictures, Statues and Motto's about it.</P>
<P>The Street where the <HI>Furriers</HI> dwelt was all full of &s;eeming A|nimals, though their Skins was &s;o artificially &s;tufft, that any Bo|dy would have taken them for liying Tygars, Lions, Bears, and Panthers. The fifth Gate, which was that of <HI>Guadalajara</HI> had its peculiar Ornaments, and after that, the <HI>Queen</HI> pa&s;t in|to the Gold&s;miths Street, the &s;ide of which, was &s;et full of An|gels of pure Silver, there were &s;een al&s;o divers Bucklers of Gold, upon which were contriv'd the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queens</HI> Names with their Arms, in Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, Emraulds, and other Stones &s;o fine and rich, that the Skilful &s;aid, there was to the value of above twelve Millions. In the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> there was an Amphitheater &s;et full of Statues, and adorn'd with Paint|ings.
<PB N="281" REF="143"> The la&s;t Gate was near that, in the middle of the fir&s;t Front of the <HI>Queen</HI> Mothers Pallace, was &s;een <HI>Apollo,</HI> all the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> the Picture of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> on Hor&s;eback, and divers other things which I did not mind &s;o much to give you an Account of them. The <HI>Pallace</HI> Court was &s;urrounded with young Men and Maids, which repre&s;ented all the Rivers both great and &s;mall of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were Crowned with Reeds and Wa|ter lillies, with Pots overturn'd, and the re&s;t of their Attire &s;uita|ble. They complimented the <HI>Queen</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> there were al&s;o erected in this Court, two Ca&s;tles of artificial Fire|works. All the <HI>Pallace</HI> was hung with the riche&s;t Tapi&s;try that belong'd to the Crown, and there are but few Places in the World where there is finer &s;een, two Chariots full of <HI>Mu&s;|cians</HI> went before their Maje&s;ties.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates of the City came out of their <HI>Publick</HI> Hou&s;e in their Robes which were made of <HI>Brocado</HI> embroider'd with Gold; they wore little Hatts buttoned up with Plumes of Fea|thers, and were mounted upon very fine Hor&s;es, they came to pre&s;ent the Keys of the City to the <HI>Queen</HI> and to receive her under a Canopy. The <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother went in a Coach all open that the People might &s;ee them, as far as the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ognates</HI> Hou&s;e, where the <HI>Queen</HI> came to them.</P>
<P>Six Trumpeters in black and red Suites in company of the City Kettle Drums mounted upon fine Hor&s;es, who&s;e Hou&s;ings were of black Velvet, march'd before the <HI>Alcade</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> the <HI>Knights</HI> of the three <HI>Malitary</HI> Orders, namely, St. <HI>James, Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> followed after in Cloaks all embroid|er'd with Gold, and their Hatts covered with Plumes of Fea|thers; after them went the <HI>Tutulados De Ca&s;tille,</HI> and the Of|ficers of the <HI>King</HI>'s Hou&s;hold, they wore white Robes, and mo&s;t of them were <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Hatts were trim'd with Diamonds and Pearl, and their Magnificence appear'd every way; they had mo&s;t admirable Hor&s;es, every one had abun|dance of Liveries, and their Footmens Suits were of Gold and Silver <HI>Brocado</HI> mixt with colour'd Silk, which lookt very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> rid upon a curious Hor&s;e of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> which the Marquis <HI>De Villa Mayna,</HI> her fir&s;t Gentleman U&s;her, led by the Reins, her Cloaths ware &s;o richly embroider'd, that one could &s;ee no Stuff, &s;he wore a Hat trim'd with a Plume of Fea|thers, and the Pearl call'd the <HI>Peregrina,</HI> which is as big as a &s;mall Pear, and of an ine&s;timable Value, her Hair hung loo&s;e upon her Shoulders, and upon her Forehead, her neck was a little bare and &s;he wore a &s;mall <HI>Fardingal,</HI> &s;he had upon her
<PB N="282" REF="144"> Finger the large Diamond of the <HI>King</HI>'s, which is pretended to be the faire&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI> But the <HI>Queens</HI> pretty Looks and her Charms &s;hin'd much brighter than all the &s;parkling Jewels with which &s;he was adorn'd; behind her and without the Canopy, went the Dutche&s;s <HI>De Terranova</HI> dre&s;t in <HI>Duenna</HI> together with <HI>Donna Laura Maria D' Alarcon</HI> Governante of the <HI>Queens</HI> Maids; they rid each of them upon a Mule. Immediately af|ter them the <HI>Queens</HI> Maids to the number of eight all cover'd with Diamonds and Embroidery, appear'd upon very fine Hor&s;es, every one having two of the <HI>Court</HI> walking by their &s;ide; the <HI>Queens</HI> Coaches went after them, and the Guards of the <HI>Lancilla</HI> brought up the Rear. She &s;topt before the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Ognate's</HI> Hou&s;e, to &s;alute the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother; &s;he alighted at St. <HI>Maries,</HI> where Cardinal <HI>Portocarero</HI> Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Tolleda,</HI> waited for her, and immediately <HI>Te Deum</HI> began, as &s;oon as it was ended, &s;he mounted her Hor&s;e again, and rid to the <HI>Pallace,</HI> where &s;he was receiv'd by the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> Mother, the <HI>King</HI> help't her off her Hor&s;e, and the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother taking her by the Hand, led her to her Apartment, where all the Ladies were waiting for her, and fell on their Knees in all Humility to ki&s;s her Hand. While I am upon this Head of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> I &s;hould tell you, Dear Cou&s;in, that I have heard there are certain <HI>Laws</HI> or <HI>Rules</HI> e&s;tabli&s;ht in the <HI>Pallace,</HI> which have been ob&s;erved there for above the&s;e hund|red Years without the lea&s;t Devotion, they are call'd the <HI>Orders</HI> or <HI>Ceremonials</HI> of the <HI>Pallace;</HI> they run thus, That the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hall go to Bed at Ten a Clock in Summer, and nine in Winter. At the <HI>Queens</HI> fir&s;t being here, &s;he did not con&s;i|der the appointed Hour, it &s;eemed to her Rea&s;onable that the Rule of going to Bed, &s;hould be when one was &s;leepy; but it frequently hapned, that as &s;he was eating her Supper, &s;ome of her Women, without &s;aying a Word to her, would begin to undre&s;s her Head, and others to pull off her Shoes under the Table, and &s;o hurry her to Bed with that ha&s;te, as made her very much wonder.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;leeps in one Apartment, and the <HI>Queen</HI> in another, but this loves his <HI>Queen</HI> too well to lie from her. It is thus noted in the <HI>Orders,</HI> That when the <HI>King</HI> comes out of his own Chamber in the Night to go into the <HI>Queens,</HI> He mu&s;t wear his Shoes like Slippers, (for here they make none of the&s;e la&s;t,) his black Cloak upon his Shoulders in&s;tead of a Night-Gown, (of which no body makes u&s;e at <HI>Madrid</HI>) his <HI>Bro|quel,</HI> or Bucklar (of which I have &s;poken in &s;ome of my Let|ters) fa&s;tned under his Arm, and his Bottle fa&s;tned by a
<PB N="283" REF="144"> String to the other: But you mu&s;t not think this Bottle holds drink to quench thir&s;t, it is for a quite contrary purpo&s;e, which you mu&s;t gue&s;s. With all this Accoutrement, the King has be&s;ides a long Rapier in one Hand, and a dark Lanthorn in t'other; and on this manner he is obliged to go all alone into the <HI>Queens</HI> Chamber.</P>
<P>There's another Order in the Ceremonial, which is, That af|ter the King has taken a <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and happens to for&s;ake her, &s;he mu&s;t be a <HI>Nun,</HI> as I have already told you. I have heard that the late King being in Love with a Lady of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> he knockt one Night &s;oftly at her Chamber Door, as &s;he imagin'd it was he, &s;o &s;he would not open it, and only &s;aid to him through the Door, <HI>Baya, Baya, con Dios, no quiero &s;er Monja;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Go, go, God be with you, I have no mind to be a Nun.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;et down, that the King every time he receives a Favour from his Mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t give her four <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> you per|ceive he will not ruin his E&s;tate thus, and that the Expence he is at for his Plea&s;ure is very moderate. To this purpo&s;e it is publickly known, that <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. the Father of the pre&s;ent King, having heard of the Beauty of a famous <HI>Courtezan,</HI> went to &s;ee her at her Hou&s;e; but being a religious Ob&s;erver of the <HI>Or|ders,</HI> he gave her but four Pi&s;tols, &s;he was very angry at &s;o di&s;|proportionate a Recompen&s;e to her Merit, but di&s;&s;embling her Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he dre&s;t her &s;elf like a <HI>Cavallero</HI> and went to &s;ee the King, and after &s;he had made her &s;elf known, and had had a mo&s;t particular Audience of him, &s;he pull'd out a Pur&s;e of four hundred <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> and laid it up on the Table: <HI>It is thus,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I pay my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es;</HI> &s;o pretending that this time the King was her <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> &s;eeing &s;he came in Man's Clothes to find him out.</P>
<P>By the&s;e <HI>Ceremonials,</HI> the fixt Time of the King's going to any of his Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure is known, whether it be to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> to <HI>Aranjues,</HI> or to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> &s;o that without &s;tay|ing for his Orders, all his Equipage is &s;ent away, and early in the Morning they go to awake him that he may ri&s;e and put on tho&s;e Cloathes that are &s;et down in the <HI>Orders</HI> according to the Sea&s;on, and after that he &s;teps into his great Coach, and &s;o ve|ry contentedly goes, where &s;everal Ages pa&s;t it has been a|greed on.</P>
<P>When the appointed time comes to return, though the King is never &s;o well pleas'd where he is, yet he mu&s;t go away, that he may not alter the Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o known, when he is to go to <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and to per|form his Devotions, at that Time the <HI>Confe&s;&s;or</HI> comes, and pre|&s;ents him&s;elf.</P>
<PB N="284" REF="145">
<P>Every <HI>Courtier,</HI> and even the <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors</HI> are oblig'd when they go into the King's Chamber to put on certain little Lawn Cuffs, which they wear quite flat upon their &s;leeves, there are Shops in the Guard-room, where the <HI>Lords</HI> hire them, and re|turn them when they come out. In like manner all the Ladies are to wear <HI>Patins</HI> when they go into the <HI>Queens</HI> pre|&s;ence, I think I have already told you that the&s;e are a kind of <HI>Sandals</HI> into which the Shoe is fa&s;tned, and which rai&s;es them up very high, if they &s;hould appear before the Queen without the&s;e <HI>Sandals,</HI> &s;he would take it very ill.</P>
<P>The Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> have none but Widdows and Maids a|bout them, the <HI>Pallace</HI> is &s;o full of them, that one can &s;ee no|thing el&s;e through the Latices and in the Balconies. And here's one thing &s;eems to me very &s;ingular, which is, That a Man al|though he be Married is allow'd to declare him&s;elf the <HI>Lover</HI> or <HI>Gallant</HI> of a <HI>Lady</HI> of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> and for her &s;ake to commit all the Follies and to &s;pend all the Money he can, without being in the lea&s;t blam'd for it. One &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e <HI>Gallants</HI> in the <HI>Court,</HI> and all the Ladies in the Windows, where 'tis their dai|ly Employment to di&s;cour&s;e with, and entertain one another by their Fingers: For you mu&s;t know that <HI>their Hands</HI> &s;peak a Language that is perfectly intelligible; and as it might be gue&s;t at if it was always alike, and that the &s;ame Signs always meant the &s;ame things, &s;o they agree with their <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> upon certain private Signs and Actions, which no Body el&s;e under|&s;tands. This kind of <HI>Love</HI> is publick, a Man mu&s;t be of a pe|culiar &s;ort of Wit and Humour dextrou&s;ly to manage the&s;e In|trigues and to be accepted by the Ladies, for they are wonder|ful delicate and nice, they do not talk like other People. In the <HI>Pallace</HI> there reigns a certain Genius and Strain of Wit, quite different from that in the City, and &s;o peculiar, that one mu&s;t learn it as they do an Art or a Trade. When the <HI>Queen</HI> goes abroad, all, or however the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Ladies</HI> go with her; then the <HI>Gallants,</HI> who are con&s;tantly upon the Watch, go a foot by their Coach &s;ides, that they may enjoy their Conver&s;ation. It is really good Sport to &s;ee how the&s;e poor Lovers dirty them&s;elves, for the Streets are horrid na&s;ty; but then, the more dirty the more gallant. When the <HI>Queen</HI> returns home late, there are carried before the Coaches where her <HI>Ladies</HI> are, forty or fifty <HI>Flamboys</HI> of white Wax; and this &s;ometimes makes a very glorious Illumination; for there are &s;everal Coaches, and in every one divers <HI>Ladies,</HI> &s;o that fre|quently, one may &s;ee a above a thou&s;and <HI>Flamboys,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e the Queen has.</P>
<PB N="285" REF="145">
<P>When the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> are let Blood, the Chyrurge|on takes a mighty care of the Ligature, Fillet, or any Cloth or Handkerchief upon which any of the Blood of the fair one is has fallen; for he never fails to make a rich Pre&s;ent of it to the <HI>Ca|vellero</HI> that loves her, and this is lookt upon to be a worthy Oc|ca&s;ion for a Man to ruine him&s;elf to all intents; there have been &s;ome &s;o extravagantly fooli&s;h, as to give the Chyrurgeon the greate&s;t part of their <HI>Plate;</HI> you mu&s;t not fancy this is only a Spoon, a Fork, or a Knife, which may be the Stock of a great many we know; No, no, I a&s;&s;ure you, this extends to the va|lue of Three or four thou&s;and Crowns; and this is a Cu&s;tom &s;o rooted among&s;t them, that a Man had rather feed upon no|thing but Radi&s;hes and Leeks all the Year long, than not to perform what he is oblig'd to do upon the&s;e &s;ort of Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Few of the Ladies of the Palace leave it without being very advantagiou&s;ly married; there are al&s;o the Queens <HI>Menines,</HI> who are &s;o very Young when they come to her, that &s;he has &s;ome not above &s;ix or &s;even Years old; the&s;e are Children of the highe&s;t Quality, I have &s;een &s;ome of them more beautiful than the <HI>God of Love</HI> him&s;elf was ever painted.</P>
<P>On &s;ome &s;olemn Days, when the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> go a|broad, or when the Queen gives Audicnce, every Lady has the Priviledge to place by her &s;ides two <HI>Cavelleros</HI> who put on their Hats before their <HI>Maje&s;ties,</HI> although they be not <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> they are call'd <HI>Embevecidos,</HI> that is, <HI>Drunk with Love,</HI> and &s;o tran&s;ported with their Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Plea&s;ure of being near their <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> that they are uncapable of minding any thing el&s;e, they are permitted to be cover'd for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that mad Men are, who under&s;tand not their Obligation to De|cency and good Manners; but yet to enjoy this Liberty, they mu&s;t have leave from their Ladies, otherwi&s;e they dare not pre&s;ume to attempt it.</P>
<P>There is no other Diver&s;ion at Court than Plays; but during the Carnaval, they empty Eggs by a little hole in the Shell, and fill them full of &s;weet &s;cented Water, and then &s;top them up again with Wax, and when the King is at a Play, he throws the&s;e at every body, and every one in imita|tion of his Maje&s;ty throw them likewi&s;e at one another; this perfum'd Rain makes the Air very &s;weet, but withal wets People pretty hand&s;omly, and this is one of their greate&s;t Pa&s;time's, there's hardly any body at this &s;ea&s;on but what carries a hun|dred of the&s;e Egg-&s;hells, that are either fill'd with Orange-flow|er, or &s;ome other &s;weet &s;cented Water, and as they go along in their Coaches throw them in Folks Faces: At this time the Peo|ple al&s;o plea&s;e them&s;elves after their fa&s;hion; for example,
<PB N="286" REF="146"> they'll break off the neck of a Bottle, and tye the part that is within the Wicker, to the Tail of a Dog, and &s;ometimes you &s;hall &s;ee above two thou&s;and run after him.</P>
<P>The King's Dwarf is the prettie&s;t that ever I &s;aw, his Name is <HI>Lovi&s;illo;</HI> he was born in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he is extream little, and exactly well proportion'd; he has a hand&s;ome Face, an admira|ble Complexion, and not only wittier than one can imagine, but withal very wi&s;e and knowing. When he goes to take the Air, there's a Groom to wait on him, who rides upon one Hor&s;e, and carries another before him, which is &s;o very &s;mall, that he may properly be term'd a <HI>Dwarf</HI> Hor&s;e, and is as hand&s;ome for his kind as his Ma&s;ter is for his. This Hor&s;e is brought to the Place where <HI>Lovi&s;illo</HI> is to mount him, for he would be almo&s;t tyr'd if he was to walk &s;o far; and it is really a great plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Dexterity of this little Animal and his Ma&s;ter, when he orders him like a manag'd Hor&s;e. I do a&s;&s;ure you that when he is upon his Back, they do not both make above three quar|ters of an Ell in height. He &s;aid very &s;eriou&s;ly t'other day, that he would fight the Bull at the fir&s;t <HI>Bull-Fea&s;t,</HI> for the &s;ake of his Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Donna Elvire.</HI> This is a little Girl about &s;even or eight years of Age, but wonderful beautiful. The Queen commanded him to be her Gallant. It is a great Happine&s;s for this Child that &s;he is fallen into the Queen's hands. I'll tell you how it happen'd.</P>
<P>The Fathers of Mercy went to redeem a certain number of Slaves which they brought to <HI>Madrid:</HI> and according to their Cu&s;tom of coming through the City in Proce&s;&s;ion, the Queen chanced to ca&s;t her Eyes upon a Captive Woman which led two little Girls by the hand; they &s;eem'd to be Si&s;ters, but there was this difference between them, that one was extream hand&s;ome, and the other as ugly. The Queen made her come to her, and ask'd her if &s;he was the Mother of tho&s;e two Children; &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he was Mother only to the ugly one. And how came you by the other, &s;aid the Queen? Madam, reply'd the Woman, we were in a Ve&s;&s;el in which there was a great Lady big with Child, but we did not know who &s;he was, only by her At|tendance, and the Richne&s;s of her Cloaths, it was ea&s;ie to think &s;he mu&s;t be of Quality. After a long and &s;harp fight, we were taken, the greate&s;t part of her People were kill'd; and &s;he was &s;o frighted, that &s;he fell in Travail, and as &s;oon as &s;he was de|liver'd, dy'd. I was by her, and &s;eeing this poor little Creature without a Nur&s;e, and ready to peri&s;h, I re&s;olv'd to nouri&s;h it up with my own, if 'twas po&s;&s;ible. As &s;oon as the <HI>Cor&s;aires</HI> were Ma&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rs of our Ship, they divided the booty among&s;t them|&s;elves;
<PB N="287" REF="146"> they were in two Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o each took away with them the Lot that was fallen to them. Tho&s;e remaining Women, and other Servants which belong'd to this Lady were on one &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el, and I on the other; &s;o that, Madam, conti|nu'd the Woman, I was never able to learn what or who the Per&s;on was, who&s;e Child I &s;aved. I now look upon her as my own Daughter, and &s;he believes I am her Mother. So charita|ble a Deed, &s;ays the Queen, &s;hall not go unrewarded; I &s;hall take care of you, and the little <HI>Incognito</HI> I will keep. And in|deed the Queen loves it &s;o extreamly, that the Girl always wears very rich Cloaths. She follows her Maje&s;ty every where, and talks to her with that grace and freedom as &s;ufficiently de|clares her to be of no mean Original. Perhaps time my di&s;co|ver who &s;he is.</P>
<P>Here are none of tho&s;e &s;olemn and plea&s;ant Fe&s;tivals which are at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> when the Ladies have the Honour to eat with their Maje&s;ties. All is very re&s;erv'd in this Court, and in my Opinion, nothing but a general and con&s;tant habit could pre|vent abundance of things from being extream tedious to them. Tho&s;e Ladies which do not actually dwell at Court, never come to it, but when the Queen &s;ends for them, and &s;he is not allow'd to &s;end for them often neither. She lives for the mo&s;t part with|out any other Company than her Women, there was never any Life more melancholy than hers.</P>
<P>When &s;he goes a hunting, (and you mu&s;t know, that of all the Queens that have reign'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;he's the fir&s;t that has had this Liberty,) and is come to the place appointed for mounting on Hor&s;eback, &s;he mu&s;t &s;et her feet upon the Coach boot, and &s;o throw her &s;elf upon her Hor&s;e. It is not long &s;ince &s;he had one, that being a little &s;hy and skitti&s;h, would &s;tart away as &s;he leapt upon him, and &s;o &s;he had a mo&s;t grievous fall. When the King is there, he a&s;&s;i&s;ts her, but no body el&s;e dare come &s;o near the Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> as to touch them and help them on Hor&s;eback; they had rather they &s;hould be hurt, and that their Lives &s;hould be expos'd to the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>She has fourteen Matre&s;&s;es or Quilts upon her Bed; there's neither Flocks nor Feather-beds us'd here, the&s;e <HI>Quilts</HI> being made of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, which is the fine&s;t in the World; they are not above three fingers thick, &s;o that her Bed is no higher than one of ours in <HI>France.</HI> They make the&s;e Matre&s;&s;es &s;o thin that they may the more ea&s;ily be turn'd and remov'd; and in|deed I have ob&s;erv'd that they keep hollower, and are not near &s;o hard.</P>
<P>It is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Madrid,</HI> for the Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of
<PB N="288" REF="147"> the Hou&s;e to go before tho&s;e that come to &s;ee them; they think this is a piece of great Civility, to leave, &s;ay they, a Per&s;on in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that is in the Room. As to the Women they do not ki&s;s one another in their Salutation, they only pre&s;ent their hand without Glove.</P>
<P>They have another Cu&s;tom, which I think odd and peculiar e|nough, and that is, when a Daughter has a mind to be marry'd, and is the elde&s;t, and has already made her choice, though both her Father and Mother are again&s;t the Match, &s;he need only go to the Curate of the Pari&s;h and tell him the Matter, and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is done. Immediately he takes her from her Parents Hou&s;e, and either puts her into a Convent, or to &s;ome devout Lady, where &s;he remains for a little time; afterwards, if &s;he per&s;e|veres in her Re&s;olution, the Father and Mother are obliged to give her a Portion &s;uitable to her Quality and their E&s;tate, and in &s;pight of them &s;he is marry'd. Partly upon this Account it is, that &s;uch care is taken to keep their Daughters clo&s;e, and to let no body &s;peak to them, and &s;o to make it difficult for them to take any mea&s;ures for the management of an Intreague. O|therwi&s;e, provided the <HI>Cavallero</HI> be a Gentleman, it is &s;uffici|ent, and he may marry his Mi&s;tre&s;s, though &s;he &s;hould prove to be the Daughter of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Since my being in this Country, I think I have not neglect|ed informing you of every thing; I will now proceed to fini&s;h my Memoirs of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;eeing tho&s;e I fir&s;t &s;ent you plea&s;e you &s;o well. I &s;hall &s;end you the re&s;t as fa&s;t as any thing happens and offers it &s;elf, that is worth your Curio&s;ity and no|tice. I do al&s;o promi&s;e you to write you that Relation you de|&s;ire of me. But for all the&s;e little Trifles, I mu&s;t beg you, dear Cou&s;in, to grant me &s;omething that is con&s;iderable, and that is, the Continuation of your Friend&s;hip, for which I have a ju&s;t value.</P>
