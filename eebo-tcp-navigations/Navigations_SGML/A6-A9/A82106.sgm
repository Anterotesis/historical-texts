<P>VVHen we beheld the glorious &s;plendor of Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, beaming forth it &s;elf in your Remon&s;trance to the Hou&s;e of Commons, we were filled with joy and &s;atisfaction, that the divine pre&s;ence had again over&s;hadowed you, and appe|red thereby to us with &s;miles of love, and pledges of favour, when with the night of ruine we were almo&s;t overwhelmed
