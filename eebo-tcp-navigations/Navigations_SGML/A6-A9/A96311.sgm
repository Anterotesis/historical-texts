<P>A SAD RELATION OF THE MISERIES OF THE Province of MUNSTER in the Realm of IRELAND: Signified by Letters written from thence very lately, by a Gentleman of good credit, to his brother here in LONDON. By which it doth appear, in what imminent danger that Province now is for to be lo&s;t, and how numerous the Rebels now are there gathered together in their Siege of <HI>Youghall,</HI> with a Di&s;|covery of their barbarous and cruell u&s;age to tho&s;e Engli&s;h they take pri&s;oners.</P>

<P>_MY la&s;t was of the <HI>21^t^h.</HI> pa&s;t, of which you need no repe|tall, having many &s;ad pa&s;&s;a|ges to relate which have happened &s;ince; as the Re|bels taking of <HI>Li&s;more,</HI> and all the Ca|&s;tles thereabouts; <HI>Li&s;more</HI> men made
<PB N="2" REF="3">very &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, untill it was beaten down about their ears; they killed <HI>3.</HI> or <HI>4.</HI> hundred of them, and after came forth up|on Quarter: They have layen down before <HI>Youghall,</HI> and have environed it round: Another Army is lately fallen on the ea|&s;ter&s;ide of the River, where they have planted <HI>3.</HI> peeces of Ordnance, which doth much anoy the Inhabitants: On Tue&s;day they made an unfortunate &s;hot into the powder room of the <HI>Duncannon</HI> frigat, which blow her up and about <HI>18.</HI> of her men, many of the re&s;t dangerou&s;ly hurt and burnt, and another Ship (I remember not her Name) with much difficulty got forth out of the Harbour, and lieth now with the Happy entrance, and the May flower, about <HI>Cable Iland,</HI> where I fear they can do no great good, &s;o that that Town is in great danger to be lo&s;t likewi&s;e,
<PB N="3" REF="3">for I know they have not provi&s;ions in it for <HI>15.</HI> daies, and they have not any thing to encourage the poor Souldiers within nor without, their Cows are &s;tarv'd, no hopes of the lea&s;t benefit of harve&s;t, and unle&s;&s;e &s;ome &s;peedy relief out of <HI>England, 2.</HI> or <HI>3.</HI> thou|&s;and men and provi&s;ions, or &s;ome miracu|lous deliverance from above betide us, their work will be &s;oon done, I am very doubtfull before the fine of the next moneth we &s;hall be all de&s;troyed, and they ready to tran&s;port them&s;elves for <HI>Wales</HI> or <HI>England.</HI> Ne|ver were there the like barbarous acts com|mitted by any Nation as the&s;e do daily practi&s;e; the men which they took in <HI>Ro|&s;tillo hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;uch other pri&s;oners as they have taken &s;ince, are carried about in the Army maked as ever they were borns, manacled with ropes and iron &s;o that they have not the benefit of their hands to beat
<PB N="4" REF="4">the flies from their bodies, but are eaten and &s;tung, and &s;o &s;corched with the Sun, that it is mo&s;t lamentable to behold. It is repor|ted that within the&s;e <HI>4.</HI> or <HI>5.</HI> daies, they be|gin to allow them (e&s;pecially the women) raggs meerly to cover their nakedne&s;&s;e; this you may report and affirm to be truth. On Tue&s;day la&s;t we redeemed <HI>20.</HI> poor &s;ouls by exchange, which came to us in this con|dition: I would have this made known to the <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> and to &s;uch <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> as do adhere to them again&s;t us, and be re&s;olved whether this be as they would have it; you will finde their work being once done here, they will be po&s;ting into <HI>England,</HI> or &s;ome out of <HI>England</HI> will come unto them, and neither can be good; which might ea&s;ily have been prevented, had all tho&s;e that &s;peak us fair been our friends, our bloud will be required at &s;ome of their
