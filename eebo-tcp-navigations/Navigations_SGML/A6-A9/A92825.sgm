<HEAD>A true Relation of a mo&s;t bloody, trea|cherous and cruel De&s;ign of the Dutch in the New-Netherlands in America.</HEAD>
<P>THe Colonies of New-England con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Governments, as that of Connecticot, of Newhaven, Road I&s;land, Plymouth, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, the Province of Main, and Pemmaquid, &amp;c. part of them di&s;tinct Juri&s;dictions, and part confederate and a&s;&s;ociate, have the Dutch &s;etled to the Southwe&s;t of them, at the Manatha's or New-Netherlands, and the French to the North|ea&s;t, along&s;t the Grand River of Canada; be|tween which Nations there hath been ever (till now of late) a friendly corre&s;pondence, and a mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the common Enemy, the barbarous Indians.</P>
<P>About &s;ix years &s;ince the Dutch being re|duced to a great exigence and &s;trait by the In|dians,
<PB N="4" REF="3"> implored the Engli&s;h ayd and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, which immediately was &s;ent them, un|der the command of Captain Underhill, a Gentleman of &s;pirit, experience, and conduct, who prizing Chri&s;tian Blood beyond Indian Wealth and Trea&s;ure (being proffered a hog&s;|head of their Wampampege to withdraw the Engli&s;h Forces) fell on the&s;e Heathens, in vin|dication of the Dutch, and in one night cut off fourteen hundred of them, and &s;o gallant|ly, with the hazard and &s;ome lo&s;s of Engli&s;h Blood (through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Omnipo|tent) re&s;etled the Hollander in peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>But Ingratitude overclouding the&s;e Hero|ick Actions, and Amboyna's treacherous Cru|elty extending it &s;elf from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t Indiaes, running in its proper channel of Dutch blood, quickly &s;ought their Neighbors, their Friends, their Noble Defenders, the Eng|li&s;h, De&s;truction; and by their unworthy in|equality of retribution, have chronicled them|&s;elves, Ungrateful, Perfidious, Bloody, and Cruel.</P>
<P>For about March la&s;t 1653. with gifts and large promi&s;es they in&s;tigated and hired four
<PB N="5" REF="3"> of the Heathen Sagamores (the Grand Princes of tho&s;e Territories, of the Mohawks, Nara|gan&s;es, Pequets, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, and Pigwock|ets, &s;ome of them mo&s;t fierce, barbarous, and bloody people, fit in&s;truments for &s;o horrid a de&s;ign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> on a Sabbath day, when all families were at Meeting, unexpectedly to fall on the Engli&s;h, and to burn and &s;lay what po&s;&s;ibly they could: and for the better perfecting of this Diabolical Plot, they &s;upplyed the Indi|ans with Arms and Ammunition, which were di&s;per&s;ed in all their habitations, they having a Ship &s;ent them on purpo&s;e from Holland, the Fountain of Treacheries, with all nece&s;&s;ary tools for the acting of a &s;econd Amboyna Tragedy.</P>
<P>But the Omnipotent God (who hath ever been a mo&s;t merciful Protector of the Eng|li&s;h in tho&s;e parts, as in the Pequet War, &amp;c.) did through his infinite goodne&s;s mo&s;t time|ly before the bloody day of acting, cau&s;e an Indian, that &s;hould have been an Executioner, to be a revealing Deliverer of our Nation, who informed the Magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton of the Dutch and Indians bloody intentions; whereupon they reque&s;ted &s;everal Merchants
<PB N="6" REF="4"> of that Town with all expedition to march forth towards the Indian habitations, to &s;ee what they could di&s;cover. At who&s;e de&s;ire Mr Gardner, Mr Hutchin&s;on, Mr Houper, and Mr Seavern rid forth, and the fir&s;t Wigwambs or Indian hou&s;es they came to &s;earching, they found them full of Arms and Ammunition, (which have been ever prohibited the Indians by the Engli&s;h,) all their Muskets were char|ged with powder and ball, which they brought with them to Bo&s;ton: the Country was immediately put in a po&s;ture of defence, and two Gentlemen &s;ent from Bo&s;ton, viz. Captain John Leveret, and Mr Davis, to the New Nether-lands with &s;ome Indians that confe&s;&s;ed, that they were hired by the Dutch for to be In&s;truments in this unheard of and unparallel Inhumanity.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen returning, &s;ufficiently a&s;|&s;ured the Governors and Magi&s;trates of the Dutch guiltine&s;s of this Treachery; where|upon the Country was rai&s;ing Forces to march again&s;t them; Captain Hathorn, beating his Drums in Salem for Volunteers, had one hun|dred and fifty &s;tout men that proffered their &s;ervice: Mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h in the South|we&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="4"> parts are enforced to for&s;ake their habi|tations. Some Letters affirm, that the French are con&s;ederate with the Dutch and Indians, &s;o that the Engli&s;h are invironed with their enemies. But that out of the hands of all their Enemies the Lord may deliver them, Let all good Chri&s;tians implore a ble&s;&s;ing from the Almighty, that is mo&s;t powerful to &s;ave, that he may crown their Enterprizes with &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful Victories. Amen.</P>
<P>The Ship that came from New-England arrived at Dorthmouth after &s;ix weeks voy|age, loaden with Tarr, belonging to William Philips of Bo&s;ton, being the fir&s;t Ship that came thence &s;ince the bloody Tragedy &s;hould have been acted.</P>
<P>If any de&s;ire to be better informed of what here is in&s;erted, let them repair to any Mer|chant that holds Corre&s;pondence with New-England, who&s;e Letters can evidence the certainty hereof.</P>
