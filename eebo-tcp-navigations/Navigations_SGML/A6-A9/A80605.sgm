<P>BY one of Credit, who is come out of the We&s;t from my Lord Generalls quarters it is al&s;o certified, that the Lord Generall hath again fallen upon <HI>Greenvill;</HI> and Routed him, and taken Foy, and 34 peece of Ordnance, and that <HI>Greenvill</HI> him&s;elfe if fled as is &s;uppo&s;ed, either to Pendennis Ca&s;tle, or (which is indeed more probable) to the mount, that is, a Ca&s;tle upon a mount called Mi|chaels Mount &s;tanding upon a Rocke in the Sea; at the further end almo&s;t of all Cornewall.</P>

<HEAD>The Relation (as it is made by the Me&s;&s;enger) of the Lord <HI>Generals</HI> Victory in the VVe&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>SInce my Lord Generall hath rai&s;ed the &s;iege at Plimouth, and taken Mount Stamford, and Plympton, His Excellencie hath al&s;o frighted 2000 of prince Maurices forces away, that were quarteted about Laun&s;on, and took there two pieces of Ord|nance, and hath al&s;o taken Foy, and there 34. peece of Ordnance, in the Towne and and in &s;ome &s;hips that are taken, and &s;ince his Excellency beat Greenvill and his for|ces from Newbridge, and taken his hor&s;e, and his &s;ouldiers well fle&s;ht with the pur|cha&s;e there which Greenvill had plundered, the Lord Generall hath againe falne upon Greenvils quarters and routed him: the Lord Generall hath taken many pri&s;oners, and betweene two and three thou&s;and are
<PB REF="4"> come in to him out of Plimouth: be&s;ides divers others out of other parts of Cornwal, and many of Prince Mawrice his forces come in and &s;ubmit to my Lord Generall, de&s;iring to take the Covenant: there are many armes found fcattered up and down, which the Enemy throw ftom them in the flight, here a Musket, there a &s;word, and here a pike, and there another piece of arms, and it cannot be po&s;sible that Greenvill can ever rally his men again to any purpo&s;e, but is fled, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed; either to Penden|nis Ca&s;tle, or to the Mount: but it is thought that as Arundell did oppo&s;e the Queene, fo he will hardly admit Greenvill to &s;helter there: &s;o that it is rather beileved he is gone to the Mount, whither the Lord Admirall is putting forth &s;hips, and the Lord Roberts is in pur&s;uit of Greenvil. The King is at Exeter as is &s;uppo&s;ed, expecting Prince Rupert to come thither, by that time my Lord General returnes out of Cornwall.</P>
<P>On Satterday la&s;t, there were Letters read in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which brought good news out of Ireland, and to this effect.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>That 14000. Scots are come out of the North of Ireland towards Dublin, and that the Prote&s;tants in Mun&s;ter ri&s;e again&s;t the Rebels, and are nigh 1000. That <HI>Inchiquin</HI> is in Ireland, and hath laid down his Commi&s;&s;ion, and declared him&s;elfe for the Parlia|ment, again&s;t the Rebels in Ireland.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o certified from thence, that the Rebels &s;ent to the Marquis of Ormond, to de&s;ire him to ap|point the Engli&s;h Commanders that are in Dublin, to leade the Catholicks again&s;t the Scots, but the Marquis of Ormond returned an&s;wer, that it was advi&s;e as he conceived did not tend to any good to them, for if the Engli&s;h Commanders &s;hould be put upon &s;uch a de&s;igne, it would cau&s;e them to leave all as he thought, and joyn with the Scots again&s;t them, and therefore the Marquis as it is certified from thence, would do nothing at all in it. The Scots by this time it is believed is within 12. miles of Dublin.</P>
