<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_ENtering upon &s;o great a Work, being no &s;mall Concern in my Territory of Bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;up|po&s;e it proper, never Apologizing hereto|fore, by way of Preface, to give you a brief Review of all my former Endeavors, &s;o lead|ing you on to this pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Many years are pa&s;t with various Revoluti|ons, &s;ince in the fir&s;t Fluctuations of the late Grand Rebellion, I being left at lei&s;ure from former Imployments belonging to the quiet of Peace wherein I was bred, in &s;tead of Arms, to which in parties mo&s;t began to buckle, I betook my &s;elf to &s;omething of <HI>Literature,</HI> in which, till then, altogether a Stran|ger; And drawing towards the Evening of my Age, I made a lit|tle Progre&s;s, bending my &s;elf to &s;ofter Studies, adapted to my Abi|lities and Inclinations, <HI>Poe&s;ie:</HI> And fir&s;t Rallying my new rais'd Forces, a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable parcel of <HI>Latin,</HI> I undertook no le&s;s a Conque&s;t, than the Reducing into our Native Language; the Great Ma&s;ter and Grand Improver of that Tongue, <HI>Vir|gil,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Roman</HI> Poets; and though I fell much &s;hort in this my vain Enterpri&s;e, yet &s;uch, and &s;o happy prov'd the Ver&s;i|on, and &s;o fairly accepted, that of me, till then ob&s;cure, <HI>Fame</HI> be|gan to prattle, and &s;oon after I, for&s;ooth, &s;tood forth a new <HI>Author,</HI> and &s;o much cheer'd up with fre&s;h Encouragements, that from a <HI>Mean Octavo,</HI> a <HI>Royal Folio</HI> Flouri&s;h'd, Adorn'd with Sculp|ture, and Illu&s;trated with Annotations, Triumphing with the affixt Emblazons, Names, and Titles of a hundred <HI>Patrons,</HI> all bold A&s;|&s;ertors in Vindication of the Work, which (what e're my De&s;erts) being Publi&s;h'd with that Magnificence and Splendor, appear'd a new, and taking Beauty, the faire&s;t that till then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;s ever boa&s;ted.</P>
<P>Yet this fir&s;t Endeavour rais'd my Reputation no farther, than to be accounted a Good <HI>Tran&s;lator,</HI> a Faithful <HI>Interpreter,</HI> one that had dabled well in anothers <HI>Helicon;</HI> but I, greedy of more,
<PB REF="8">having ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of a little Fame, would not thus &s;it down, but ambitious to try my own Wing, endeavor'd to Sore a little higher. The mo&s;t Antient and Wi&s;e&s;t of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Sages, who fir&s;t led us through a Vocal Fore&s;t, where Bea&s;ts al&s;o &s;pake, and Birds &s;at Chanting in every Tree, Notes for Men to follow: <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> the Prince of <HI>Mythologi&s;ts</HI> became my Quarry, on his plain Song I De&s;canted, on his &s;hort and pithy Sayings, Paraphras'd, rai&s;ing my voice to &s;uch a height, that I took my degree among&s;t the <HI>Minor Poets.</HI></P>
<P>My next Expedition with Sails a Trip, and &s;woln with the Breath of a general Applau&s;e, was to di&s;cover <HI>Greece,</HI> that there, I might from <HI>Homers</HI> own hand, the King of <HI>Perna&s;&s;us,</HI> receive plentifully at the Fountain-Head &s;taining Draughts of the brisker <HI>Hypocreen;</HI> in which I had a double De&s;ign, not onely to bring over &s;o Antient and Famous an Author, but to inable my &s;elf the better to carry on an <HI>Epick Poem</HI> of my own Compo&s;ure; who&s;e <HI>Iliads</HI> with much Co&s;t and Labor at la&s;t fini&s;hing, being Dedicated to His Sacred Maje&s;ty, and Crown'd with His Gracious Acceptance, I main|tain'd my Po&s;t, loo&s;ing no ground of former Reputation.</P>
<P>Soon after, being order'd by the <HI>Commi&s;sion of Triumphs,</HI> to Ban|quet His Maje&s;ty at the Cities co&s;t with a <HI>Poetick Entertainment,</HI> Marching with His Train of Nobles through His Imperial Cham|ber to His Corronation at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the Argument being great, &s;eeming almo&s;t impo&s;sible to &s;et forth the Dear Affections, and un|expre&s;sible Joys of all His Loyal Subjects, e&s;pecially of His <HI>Metro|polis London,</HI> at His &s;o Happy Re&s;tauration; and that the Glory of &s;o Bright a Day, the mo&s;t Splendid that e're this Nation &s;aw, &s;hould not clo&s;e with the Setting-Sun, but appear a &s;hining Tro|phy to Po&s;terity; I, at my own proper Co&s;t and Pains, brought it to light once more, in a <HI>Royal Folio,</HI> containing the whole Solem|nity, the Triumphal Arches and <HI>Cavalcade,</HI> delineated in Sculpture, the Speeches and Impre&s;&s;es Illu&s;trated from Antiquity, and Dedi|cated to His Maje&s;ty; of which, &s;ome, and but a few, e&s;caping the late Conflagration, remain'd.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t I bu&s;ied my &s;elf thus, neither &s;paring Co&s;t nor Pains, to dre&s;s and &s;et forth my own Volumns with all the Splendor and O&s;tentation that could be, I thought it al&s;o Religious, and the part of a good Chri&s;tian, to do &s;omething for Gods &s;ake, to adorn in like manner, with Ornamental Accompli&s;hments, the <HI>Holy Bi|ble,</HI> which by my own &s;ole Conduct, proper Co&s;t and Charges, at la&s;t appear'd the large&s;t and faire&s;t Edition that was ever yet &s;et forth in any Vulgar Tongue.</P>
<P>Next in order to the compleating of <HI>Homer,</HI> I fell upon his <HI>Odi&s;|&s;es,</HI> which Dedicated to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then His Maje&s;ties Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to whom, in that Kingdom, in the late mi&s;erable Di&s;tractions, I was a Servant, he kindly accept|ing thereof.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>Then, being re&s;tle&s;s, though weary of tedious Ver&s;ions, and &s;uch long Journeys in Tran&s;lating Greek and Latin Poets, Works asking no le&s;s than a Mans whole life to accompli&s;h, I, the better to feed my Fancy with variety of Objects, a &s;econd time betook my &s;elf to <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> where I found &s;uch Succe&s;s, that &s;oon I &s;eem'd to tread Air, and walk alone, becoming al&s;o a <HI>Mytholo|gi&s;t;</HI> not onely Paraphra&s;ing, but a De&s;igner of my own Fables, and at la&s;t &s;crew'd my &s;elf up to a greater height, fini&s;hing two He|roick Poems, <HI>viz. The Ephe&s;ian Matron,</HI> and <HI>The Roman Slave,</HI> which Volumn, a mo&s;t Worthy and Illu&s;trious Per&s;on, the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ery,</HI> vouch&s;afed to Patronize; and although a Second Part, met with a Fate not common, to be e&s;teem'd equal with the for|mer.</P>
<P>Thus elevated by the Succe&s;s of the&s;e my la&s;t heightned E&s;&s;ays, I thought it time to go on (having fitted Materials, both Hi&s;torick and Poetick) with my long intended Edifice, my own great Fa|brick, an <HI>Epick Poem,</HI> already divided into twelve Books, &s;ome al|mo&s;t fini&s;h'd, call'd <HI>CAROLIES,</HI> from our Miracle of <HI>Hero's, Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, being the be&s;t Pattern of true Prudence, Valor, and Chri&s;tian Piety; of whom, though too late, and too unworthy to be affix'd to his Her&s;e, out of the abundance of my Zeal and Loy|alty to &s;o matchle&s;s a Worthy; I hope there may be indulgence for the placing the&s;e Lines, which may remain to Po&s;terity, in the Portal of this Great Work.</P>
<Q><L>Mirror of Princes! <HI>Charles,</HI> the Royal Martyr,</L>
<L>Who for Religion, and His Subjects Charter,</L>
<L>Spent the be&s;t Blood Inju&s;tice Sword e're dy'd,</L>
<L>Since the rude Souldier Pierc'd our Saviours &s;ide;</L>
<L>Who&s;e Sufferance, Patience, reach'd to &s;uch a height,</L>
<L>For Angels onely with Sun-beams to write:</L>
<L>No mortal Hand, le&s;s my unworthy Pen,</L>
<L>Fit to Di&s;play the be&s;t of Kings and Men.</L></Q>
<P>This Work thus &s;ettled, and &s;o well re&s;olv'd upon to be the Pride, Diverti&s;ement, Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ole Comfort of my Age, that day annually &s;o fatal to the Royal Party, &s;wallow'd in that devour|ing Deluge of Fire, with mo&s;t part of the City, that, and my whole E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus fall'n into a low condition, groaning under a double bur|then of Sickne&s;s and Poverty, and almo&s;t quite de&s;pairing, the Work that might have Boy'd me up once more, thus irrecoverably lo&s;t; and reminding, that many of my Friends, and Worthy Patrons were more favorable to my Endeavors, when under a Cloud, than after Shining in full Lu&s;tre; and that &s;ince his Maje&s;ties Re&s;taura|tion, the minds of tho&s;e re&s;tor'd to former Fortunes, or rais'd to &s;everal Advancements, were more abroad, and not at lei&s;ure to
<PB REF="9">look on &s;uch private Diverti&s;ements at home; &s;o that tho&s;e later Volumns, which in cour&s;e were Printed to perfect the former, re|main'd a Drug, until the in&s;atiate Flames, at once, and in one bad Market, clear'd me of my Store, and Hou&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides grave <HI>Poe&s;ie,</HI> in which <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil's Heros</HI> &s;pake Honor, and the greatne&s;s of their Souls; comprizing in few Lines, by Example, more Rules of good Life, than Phylo&s;ophers in many Volumns; loo&s;ing place and former Lu&s;tre, <HI>Rough Satyr, Rude Trave&s;tee,</HI> and <HI>Rhime Doggerel,</HI> gotten above, a&s;si&s;ted with &s;uch, that confidently avouch, that we in this more Refin'd Age, &s;peak better things <HI>ex tempore,</HI> than what hath been Recorded by the whole Rabble of Antiquity; looking down upon Moral Ver|tues, as &s;tale Saws, and &s;tiff Formalities, onely fit for School-Boys <HI>Theams,</HI> and that our Brisker Youth, and more Sublime Wits, &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to peru&s;e, much more to follow.</P>
<P>Thus a new <HI>Gaggle</HI> drowning the old Quire of <HI>Melodious Swans,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to de&s;i&s;t; and &s;hutting up the Fountain of the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> left Clambering &s;teep <HI>Perna&s;&s;us,</HI> and fell into the beaten way, and more frequented Paths of <HI>Pro&s;e:</HI> My fir&s;t undertaking be|ing, <HI>An Emba&s;&s;y from New Batavia, to the Emperor of China,</HI> which Publi&s;h'd in my la&s;t Lottery, prov'd &s;o acceptable, that I re&s;olv'd to carry on in the &s;ame way hereafter, the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Pen.</P>
<P>When, as in my former Acqui&s;itions, I flew fir&s;t at the highe&s;t and be&s;t <HI>Poetick Authors;</HI> &s;o now as much ambitious, I pitch'd up|on the like Accompli&s;hment in <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> and no le&s;s &s;erves my turn, than the Reducement of the whole World, <HI>viz. A New and Accu|rate De&s;cription of the Four Regions thereof,</HI> the fir&s;t of which being <HI>AFRICA;</HI> wherein, having made &s;ome Progre&s;s, &s;till Collecting more Materials towards the Compleating of &s;o great a <HI>VVork,</HI> a Vo|lumn lately Publi&s;h'd beyond Sea in <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> came to my hands, full of new Di&s;coveries, being my chief and onely Bu&s;ine&s;s to en|quire after, &s;et forth by D^r <HI>O.

<P>THe Particular Authors for the &s;everal Provinces, beginning with <HI>Egypt,</HI> are, <HI>Johannes de Leo,</HI> or <HI>Africanus, Louis Marmol, Sanutus, Francois Alvarez, Peter Belonius, Vilamont, Radziviel, Johannes Alpinus, Santen Segue&s;&s;e, Cae&s;ar, Lam|bert, Matthias Vo&s;sius, Peter de la Valle, Balthazar Tellez;</HI> the&s;e being <HI>Portugue&s;e, Italian, Latin,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Writers; be&s;ides the De&s;criptions of other both Anci|ent and Modern Geographers; as, <HI>Strabo, Diony&s;ius, Perigetes, Pomponius Mela, Ptolomy, Cluverius, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THo&s;e that give us an Account of <HI>Barbary,</HI> are the afore-mention'd <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Marmol, Diego de Haedo, Johannes Gramaye, Braeves, Cel. Curio, Diego de Torres,</HI> and others. In like manner, there is taken out of the fir&s;t Part of <HI>Leo, Marmol,</HI> and <HI>Sanutus,</HI> all that lies in <HI>Numidia, Biledulgerid,</HI> and <HI>Libia,</HI> or <HI>Zaahra,</HI> and the inmo&s;t part of <HI>Negro-land.</HI></P>
<P>AS concerning the &s;everal Places lying along the Sea-Coa&s;t of the <HI>Negroes</HI> Countrey, <HI>viz.</HI> between <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Lovango,</HI> being a Coa&s;t of about 900 Leagues, we find all the foremention'd Geographers to be defective in it: But mo&s;t of what hath been found hitherto, we have from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in their &s;everal Voyages to <HI>Guinee,</HI> Collected by <HI>Peter de Marcez,</HI> who even to the&s;e Times gives us &s;o large a De&s;cription, that it de&s;cends to the meane&s;t Village; and withal, a large Account of their Religion, Modes, Manners, and Merchandize.</P>

<P>NExt, in reference to tho&s;e Coa&s;ts near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> there hath been almo&s;t nothing &s;aid by former Writers, but onely what hath been Collected out of the &s;everal Journals of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in their Voyages to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which are very large and Authentick.</P>
<P>THe Territories and Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Nether-Ethiopia</HI> are lately as well Sur|vey'd and Delineated; fir&s;t, by that Eminent Author <HI>Johan de Barros;</HI> next, <HI>Pigafet, Sanutus, Jarrick, Moquet, Od. Barbo&s;a, Urreta, Maffeus, Peter Davty,</HI> and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>FOr the De&s;cription of the <HI>Aby&s;sines,</HI> or <HI>Upper-Ethiopia,</HI> of which we were till of late in a manner altogether ignorant, let us thank <HI>Nicholas Godig|nus, Francois Alvarez, Jarrick, Dam.

<P>ANd as concerning the I&s;lands belonging to <HI>Africa,</HI> mo&s;t of the fore-men|tion'd Authors, with &s;ome few others, have &s;et their Hands to; except the <HI>Salt-I&s;les,</HI> or tho&s;e of <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which boa&s;t their De&s;cription chiefly from <HI>Blomert.</HI></P>
<P>AL&s;o <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> or <HI>St. Laureuce, Stephen de Flaccourt</HI> hath for the mo&s;t part ingro&s;&s;ed and appropriated to him&s;elf; he being long re&s;ident there, im|ploy'd by the <HI>French Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company: Be&s;ides, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> that &s;uffer'd Ship|wrack on that Coa&s;t, hath done well; but not &s;o hit the Truth as the for|mer.</P>

<P>The Antients (as <HI>Kircher</HI> ob&s;erves) named this part <HI>Fium,</HI> which in the old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue, &s;ignifyed the Sea: not from its re&s;embling the Sea in the time of its being over-flow'd; but becau&s;e it is generally believed that hereto|fore the whole &s;urface of that part was totally covered by the Sea, until by a long Series of time, the Slime and Mud of the <HI>Nile</HI> came to &s;ettle, and at length with great labour, became firm Land. The &s;ame <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Itinerary</HI> from a certain <HI>Rabbi,</HI> affirms, that from the Patriarch <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s time, many Hebrew Monuments, and old great Buildings were found there; and that after many dayes toyle and labour, by him directed, the &s;ame was made fit to be, and was actually inhabited, according to which example, &s;ucceeding Princes con|tinually drayning the Mar&s;hy parts, made the whole Countrey u&s;eful; which thereupon became &s;o populous and wonderfully fertile in all things, that it was named, <HI>The Gift of the Immortal Gods,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates. And the Poets tell us of a great Serpent bred hereabouts, which did much mi&s;chief to the people, till &s;lain by

<P>This proof of <HI>Delta</HI>'s lying under water heretofore, makes us rightly to in|terpret <HI>Herodotus, Strabo,</HI> and others, who maintained all <HI>Egypt</HI> to have been in the &s;ame condition; whereas they mu&s;t be under&s;tood by a Synechdoche, to have taken a part for the whole, for that <HI>Egypt</HI> in general was not drown'd with the Sea, will appear from hence, that it was very Mountainous, and upon a continual a&s;cent upwards to the <HI>Nile,</HI> even as far as the <HI>Cataracts</HI> thereof, and <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>

<P>This famous River thus &s;everally known by variety of Names, by yearly inundations, doth &s;o fertllize and fatten the earth, that it provides for and furni&s;hes the Inhabitants even with an exuberance of Plenty; which proceeds from three remarkable Prerogatives, wherewith Nature hath endowed him be|yond all other Rivers: The fir&s;t is, that he &s;ends forth no foggy vapors, which makes the Air very healthful and &s;erene, being continually free either from Rain, Clouds, Mi&s;ts, or Fogs: Secondly, he runs with &s;o even and undi|&s;turbed a &s;tream, that there never accrews any danger from his Waves or Billows to any Boats, Barks or Pa&s;&s;engers &s;ailing thereon, but a &s;atisfactory plea&s;ure from his continual calm: La&s;tly, his faecundating vertue, which is &s;o great, that it cau&s;eth not onely an infinite encrea&s;e in all &s;orts of Cattel that water there; and breeds a prolifick faculty in Men and Women, but produces of all things growing from the earth a Harve&s;t plentiful even to admiration. And this fertility without di&s;pute was the cau&s;e why <HI>Egypt</HI> of old exceeded all other Nations almo&s;t, for multitude of people, and yet to this day, after &s;o many direful depopulations, may compare with tho&s;e that boa&s;t the greate&s;t number of Inhabitants: As a te&s;timony whereof, <HI>Diodorus</HI> records, that there were once in it eighteen thou&s;and &s;trong Cities; many of which, as it &s;eems, were either by Time or War lay'd wa&s;te and de&s;olate, becau&s;e we find in the Reign of <HI>Ptolomy Lagus,</HI> onely three thou&s;and Regi&s;tred, no more then remaining: which by <HI>Suidas</HI> his account, was in the Empire of <HI>Cae&s;ar Augu&s;tus,</HI> when <HI>Dio|dorus</HI> lived.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author reports, that in Elder times, the number of its Inhabi|tants were &s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and; and that in his own time, they were no le&s;s in general e&s;teem, than thirteen hundred thou&s;and; which wonder|ful encrea&s;e might be effected by the con&s;tant drinking the water of this River, who&s;e vertue had the power as &s;ome believed, to make the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Women bring forth &s;o often, not onely two or three, but &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even, nay eight Children at a Birth. And this may a little abate the wonder how the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in &s;o &s;hort a time as two hundred years (
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Broughton.</NOTE> which was all the &s;pace they &s;ojourned in <HI>Egypt</HI>) multiplyed from but &s;eventy &s;ouls, to above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men on foot, be&s;ides Women and Children; nor may tho&s;e &s;tupendious Monuments of Grandeur, which even to this day bear the name of <HI>Wonders,</HI> &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to have been erected by the Antient Kings of this Countrey, as a Remon&s;trance of their glorious Greatne&s;s and Magni|ficence, if we lay into the other Scale the infinite number of people that were under their Commands; all who&s;e hands at the Princes <HI>Fiat</HI> being em|ployed, made things otherwi&s;e &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ible to become facile; accord|ing to that of the Poet, <HI>Multorum manibus grande levatur opus.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e unu&s;ual Excellencies, and rare Qualifications of this River, the <HI>Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> made it one of their chief <HI>Numens,</HI> which they wor&s;hipped with particular Solemnities, under the name of the Godde&s;s <HI>I&s;is,</HI> to who&s;e care and kindne&s;s, they a&s;crib'd their continual freedom from the terror and dan|ger
<PB N="46" REF="38">of Earthquakes; and that they were never infe&s;ted with any Pe&s;tilential Contagion, but alwayes enjoyed a Serene whole&s;omene&s;s of Air, not &s;ubject to any impetuous &s;torms or alterations of weather, either from the Clouds or Windes: This was the cau&s;e of tho&s;e many honorable Epithetes be&s;towed on it by Antiquity; among which, one was <HI>the flowing of</HI> O&s;iris, or rather as <HI>Abenefius</HI> an <HI>Arabick</HI> Writer hath it, <HI>O&s;iris Arm;</HI> becau&s;e it did as it were reach forth to Mankind &s;o great a Plenty of Provi&s;ions: For ob&s;erving that <HI>Egypt</HI> enclo&s;ed with Mountains, did re&s;emble an Arm, and that the &s;everal par|titions at the end, &s;eemed Fingers, he appointed to the <HI>Nile</HI> the place of the <HI>Me|diana</HI> or <HI>Liver-vein;</HI> This like that in the body, &s;ending forth its quickning moi&s;ture, by who&s;e motion and circulation, it fertilitates the whole even to &s;uch an height of abundance, as makes Wonder &s;tand amaz'd, to &s;ee Nature turn Prodigal. This agrees well with the Antient Poets, who gave to this River many notable attributes: <HI>Homer</HI> the Prince of them, &s;ays it fell from Heaven out of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Bo&s;ome; from whence happily &s;prung the belief, not onely of the old <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but the later <HI>Greeks,</HI> that Heaven was its Spring|head: This made &s;ome term him, <HI>The Gift of</HI> Jupiter; others, <HI>The Tears of the Gods; The Veins of Paradice; The Seed of the Gods; The Pond of</HI> Proteus; <HI>The Husband of the Godde&s;s</HI> I&s;is, and a number of other titles of remark not unknown to the remote&s;t Nations: So that the more ignorant <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> fre|quently entitle it <HI>Ankaata Mazat Schamatarri,</HI> that is, <HI>The Fountain of Heavenly Water:</HI> The <HI>Arabian</HI> Poets <HI>Hunfarid</HI> and <HI>Eldeburge,</HI> &s;tile it <HI>Giatellartim, The life of the Earth:</HI>

The Juyce mix'd with fine Sugar, and taken inwardly, is e&s;teemed a certain Cure of all Di&s;ea&s;es of the Reins and Bladder: For it quenches or allays the inordi|nate heat of the Kidneys, and an excellent Vehicle for carrying off the &s;limy dregs out of tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els through the Bladder; &s;o that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by the fre|quent u&s;e thereof are ab&s;olutely freed from the Stone.

<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Cophtick Tongue,</HI>

Now &s;ince no Tongue comes nearer to the old <HI>E|gyptian,</HI> than the <HI>Coptick,</HI> we may rationally conclude, that the <HI>Coptick</HI> is the true and antient <HI>Egyptian,</HI> not &s;o pure and undefiled indeed, as it was in the time of the <HI>Patriarchs;</HI> but by proce&s;s of time, the manife&s;t mixture of People and Languages, and other alterations of the State di&s;gui&s;ed and corrupted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coptick</HI> in it &s;elf is an Original,

And by the &s;ame means al&s;o <HI>Latine, Arabick, Hebrew,</HI> and <HI>Samaritane</HI> Words are blended with it; but this is not &s;ufficient to root out its Original Purity.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;ets down &s;o great an Agreement between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Egyptian Tongue,</HI>

<P>But this Opinion &s;tands upon a loo&s;e Foundation; for there are great Diffe|rences between this and the other <HI>Ea&s;tern Tongues,</HI> as well in manner of Pro|nunciation, as in Words: As for example; The <HI>Hebrews</HI> call Father and Son; <HI>Ab-U-Ben;</HI> The <HI>Caldeys, Abba-Ubra;</HI> The <HI>Syrians, Abo Vabro;</HI> The <HI>Arabians, El|lab Vallabu;</HI> The <HI>Aby&s;sines, Vb Wawalda;</HI> The <HI>Armenians, Hor eu Ordi;</HI> The <HI>Sa|maritans, Ab-U-ben;</HI> The <HI>Egyptian Copticks, Fiot Nem&s;iri:</HI> Hereby appears the great Agreement of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Tongues</HI> among them&s;elves; but not in the lea&s;t with the <HI>Coptick:</HI> for what likene&s;s have the words <HI>Fiot Nem&s;iri,</HI> with <HI>Ab Uben, Abo Vabro, Ab Uben, Ab Wawolda,</HI> &amp;c.? Accordingly <HI>The&s;eus</HI> concludes, That the Analogy of &s;everal Speeches in one or two words, makes no more to prove them the &s;ame, than that Stone and Timber are <HI>Identicals,</HI> becau&s;e both grow in the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coptick</HI> hath this peculiar Property; That all the Words thereof u&s;ed by a Stranger, receive alteration in the fir&s;t Syllable, and not in the terminati|on or ultimate, u&s;ual in other Languages: Neither at this day are any Books remaining of it, onely a few words have been pre&s;erved by <HI>Greek</HI> and other Writers of mo&s;t Antiquity.</P>
<P>Authors di&s;agree about their Characters;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letters of the Anti|ent <HI>Egyptians.</HI></NOTE> however we have rea&s;on to conclude, that they were taken from the form and po&s;tures of the whole Bo|dies of Bea&s;ts, by them accounted Sacred; when they intended to &s;ignifie whatever in it &s;elf is great. The minute or le&s;&s;er matters were expre&s;t by their &s;everal parts or members.</P>
<P>As they endeavored in their holy Language to perform all their matters by My&s;teries, &s;o they did al&s;o in the vulgar <HI>Coptick,</HI> as will plainly appear by their Alphabet, con&s;i&s;ting of two and twenty Letters: wherein few but &s;ignifies &s;ome deep My&s;tery.

In like manner, under all the other Letters, according to their &s;pecifical diffe|rences, lay hid other peculiar and deep My&s;teries. Be&s;ides this, they had an|other manner of Writing: &s;o that it &s;eems the other were onely u&s;ed as Sacred <HI>Hieroglyphicks,</HI> to &s;et forth great Secrets: As a Te&s;timony whereof &s;everal <HI>Mummies</HI> have been found, upon who&s;e gilded and gummed Winding-Clothes many <HI>Coptick</HI> Letters were in&s;cribed, being no &s;mall evidence to prove the An|tiquity: becau&s;e the <HI>Mummies</HI> were Interred long before the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Cam|by&s;es,</HI> who de&s;troyed or bani&s;hed the Prie&s;ts, by which it was lo&s;t, as we have often mentioned.</P>

After much Di&s;cour&s;e held on both Sides, and the Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Beys</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, which continued about two Hours, he invited him to ta&s;te a di&s;h of <HI>Sorbet</HI> and <HI>Coffee;</HI> which done, and he about to depart, the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> accompanied him three or four &s;teps over a|gain&s;t Door of his Chamber on that &s;ide of the Room where he gave audience; and then told him, That he had a Letter from the <HI>Grand Signieur,</HI> which con|tain'd a Command to &s;end him his Head, upon the penalty of his own, and without more words, <HI>Bey</HI> having no time to e&s;cape, was immediately taken and brought through the Gallery of the Room, by the &s;ide of the Place, where u&s;u|ally Water is to wa&s;h him&s;elf; there was he beheaded, and the head in&s;tantly thrown through the Window of the Room upon the open Place, as al&s;o the Trunk or Corps through the Gallery of the <HI>Chiaus</HI> in the &s;ame Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> a man of &s;olid Judgment, and full of Courage, of the Age of five and thirty Years, withdrew him&s;elf without any tumult; but as &s;oon as it was Publi&s;hed, he was &s;urrounded with five or &s;ix Thou&s;and <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whom he &s;atisfied with Rea&s;ons. On the Morrow, the Great Men all a&s;&s;embled to|gether, with the <HI>Janizaries</HI> in the Ca&s;tle, and other Commanders, demanded of the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> the Order of the <HI>Grand Signieur,</HI> which he &s;aid, he would not deliver to any but his Ma&s;ter, neither would he &s;hew it. They threatned to take his Head in Compen&s;ation for the other; to which with a &s;etled Re&s;olution he neither an&s;wered nor re&s;i&s;ted. However, he was convey'd out of the Ca&s;tle, and kept under Guard till the <HI>Grand Signieur</HI> &s;hould &s;ignifie his Plea&s;ure, either to di&s;charge, or have him &s;ent to him.</P>
<P>The Dominion of the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> is limited and bounded by Law; for without the <HI>Kadile&s;cher</HI> or Pre&s;ident of the Council, and the Great ones of the Coun|trey, he cannot conclude any thing of great Concernment; however he

<PB N="141" REF="97">
<P>The Prie&s;ts at the appointed time Went into the <HI>Archives</HI> of the Temple, where &s;tood (but known onely to them) this Image of <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> before which in mournful po&s;tures, amid&s;t their contrite and mo&s;t doleful lamentations; they fir&s;t &s;haved their Heads, then beating their Brea&s;ts, and ripping up the Scars and new-heal'd Orifices of their former Wounds received in private as a preparation for this general Service.

All which, though in &s;ome Points differing among them&s;elves, yet in many of their Church-Ceremonies they agree with the <HI>Roman,</HI> though in others they have remarkable Differences: They inhabit &s;everal Cities, Villages, Hamlets and Cloi&s;ters be&s;ide <HI>Cairo,</HI> as at <HI>Alexandria, Sai, Tmui, A&s;na, Fe&s;tadada, Coptus, A&s;man, A&s;ioch, Ele&s;munin, Monphaluth, Caus,</HI> and in the Cloi&s;ters of St. <HI>Macharius,</HI> St. <HI>Pe|ter,</HI> St. <HI>Hermes,</HI> and St. <HI>Pachomius,</HI> adjacent to the Red-Sea.</P>

<P>This was the Confe&s;&s;ion, which they &s;tand to at this day. The Pope is by the&s;e Patriarchs, in their Letters to Him, commonly thus Entituled:</P>
<P><HI>To the Greatly E&s;teemed</HI> Pope, <HI>Father of the Prie&s;thood, Succe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;al, Apo&s;tolick, truly Believing Church, Father and Prince of Princes, Chri&s;ts Vicegerent on Earth, Sitting upon the Seat of St.</HI> Peter, <HI>Prince of the Apo&s;tles, Lord</HI> Urban <HI>the Eighth.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of one Patriarch, another is cho&s;en out of the number of Monks, re&s;iding in the Cloi&s;ters.</P>
<P>And here ob&s;erve, That ever &s;ince the Beginning of Chri&s;tianity, there were three Patriarchs, by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> Erected in the mo&s;t Famous Cities of the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> The <HI>Roman,</HI> the <HI>Alexandrian,</HI> and the <HI>Antiochian;</HI> where|to afterwards was added the <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan,</HI> by the Councils of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Chalcedon:</HI> And la&s;tly, the <HI>Jeru&s;alemitan,</HI> by the &s;ame Council of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e Cities are now Govern'd by an <HI>Alcaide,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government.</NOTE> who with his cho&s;en Councel manage all Affairs, either Martial or Civil.

Other great Alterations often happen in the chu&s;ing of Governours, in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes it hath been known, that there have been three new Governours in a Moneth, &s;o often turned out, either out of the Peoples hatred to them, or for their own Mi&s;government; and yet their whole Juri&s;diction reaches no farther than over a few little Cities, and &s;ome wandring <HI>Advars,</HI> that is, <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath from the fir&s;t Foundation, been &s;ubject to Commotions and Alterations, but more e&s;pecially &s;ince the coming of the <HI>Andaluzian Moors,</HI> that were driven out of <HI>Spain,</HI> as will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>During the continuance of the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which was from the Year Se|ven hundred and twelve, (for then they made their Conque&s;ts) for Six or &s;even hundred Years they kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; all which time the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> made it their Ma&s;ter-piece to drive them out, e&s;pecially <HI>Ferdinando</HI> the Fifteenth; for he taking into &s;erious Con&s;ideration the great mi&s;chief by them done to the Chri&s;tians, and the continual Wars wherewith they infe&s;ted them, in the Year Fourteen hundred ninety two, &s;et fiercely upon them, who &s;eeing them&s;elves in a &s;traight, and even brought under the power and obedience of <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> &s;eem'd to embrace Chri&s;tianity, though &s;carce in outward appearance they were &s;uch; however, it gain'd them a breathing while, and gave them oppor|tunities

<P>Such of them as pitched at <HI>Salee,</HI> were admitted with freedom by the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> believing they might be u&s;eful to in&s;truct his People in many Trades and Handicrafts. Here a while they lived Peaceably, yielding equal Obedience with the other Subjects; but they &s;oon &s;tarted a&s;ide, and with the Money, which in great quantities they brought from <HI>Spain,</HI> bought Arms and &s;ome Ships, wherewith they apply'd them&s;elves to Roving and Pyracy at Sea, pretending at fir&s;t to take from none but the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in revenge of their in|flicted Bani&s;hment, though indeed and in truth their malice raged upon all the Chri&s;tians.

What&s;oever Prizes they took, they pay'd to the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> as a Tribute, &s;even or ten in the Hundred, as well of Pri&s;oners as of Merchandi&s;e.

<P>When <HI>Sydan,</HI> the third Son of <HI>Hamet,</HI> after the Death of his Father and Bro|thers, had po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> though afterwards &s;tripped both of that and <HI>Morocco</HI> for a time, by the &s;everal oppo&s;ite Factions in tho&s;e Kingdoms, commanded by <HI>Hamet Ben Abdela,</HI> a Religious, but hypocritical Heremite, who hoping to get all for him&s;elf, was oppo&s;ed by <HI>Sid Hean,</HI> that took part with <HI>Sydan;</HI> by which a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Tumults at la&s;t were pacified in &s;ome mea&s;ure; yet neverthele&s;s a rabble of Pyrates inve&s;ted them&s;elves in this chief Port of <HI>Fez,</HI> inabling them&s;elves thereby to do him infinite mi&s;chief, both by Sea and Land, and not to him only, but all others who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s of Trade drew them into tho&s;e infe&s;ted Seas. Many fruitle&s;s Attempts he made upon them, &s;o that con&s;idering his own weakne&s;s at Sea for want of Ship|ping, he &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;ador unto King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> to de&s;ire his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; Nor did that Pious Prince need much Importuning to put his hand to &s;o good a Work, for he &s;oon di&s;patched thither the reque&s;ted Aids, by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>Sydan</HI> became Ma&s;ter of the Town, unroo&s;ted and puni&s;hed the Pyrates, and &s;ent Three hundred Chri&s;tian-Slaves freed for a Pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty.

<P><HI>WHEN the&s;e our Letters &s;hall be &s;o happy as to come to Your Maje&s;ties Sight, I wi&s;h the Spirit of the Righteous God may &s;o direct your Mind, that you may joyfully embrace the Me&s;&s;age I &s;end. The Regal Power allotted to Us, makes Us common Servants to our Creator, then of tho&s;e People whom we Govern: So that ob&s;erving the Duties We owe to God, We deliver Ble&s;sings to the World; in providing for the publick good of Our E&s;tates, We magnifie the Honour of God like the Cele&s;tial Bodies, which though they have much Veneration, yet &s;erve only to the Benefit of the World. It is the excellency of Our Office to be In&s;truments whereby Happine&s;s is delivered unto the Nations. Pardon me, Sir! This is not to In&s;truct, (for I know I &s;peak to one of a more clear and quick &s;ight than my &s;elf) but I &s;peak this becau&s;e God hath plea&s;ed to grant Me a happy Victory over &s;ome part of tho&s;e Rebellious Pyrates, that &s;o long have mole&s;ted the peaceable Trade of</HI> Europe, <HI>and hath pre&s;ented further occa&s;ion to root out the Ge|neration of tho&s;e, who have been &s;o pernitious to the good of Our Nations: I mean &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed God to be &s;o cu&s;picious to Our beginnings in the Conque&s;t of</HI> Sale, <HI>that We might joyn and proceed in hope of like Succe&s;s in the War of</HI> Tunis, Algiers, <HI>and other Places (Dens and Receptacles for the inhumane Villanies of tho&s;e who abhor Rule and Go|vernment.) Herein whil&s;t We interrupt the corruption of Malignant &s;pirits of the World, We &s;hall glorifie the great God, and perform a Duty that will &s;hine as glorious as the Sun and
<PB N="186" REF="127">Moon, which all the Earth may &s;ee and reverence; a Work that &s;hall a&s;cend as &s;weet as the Perfume of the mo&s;t precious Odours, in the No&s;trils of the Lord; a Work grateful and happy to Men; a Work who&s;e Memory &s;hall be reverenced &s;o long as there &s;hall be any re|maining among&s;t Men that love and honour the Piety and Vertue of Noble Minds. This Acti|on I here willingly pre&s;ent to You, who&s;e Piety and Vertues equal the Greatne&s;s of Your Power; that We who are Vicegerents to the Great and Mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the Glory which the Action pre&s;ents unto us. Now becau&s;e the I&s;lands which You Govern have been ever Famous for the unconquered Strength of their Shipping, I have &s;ent this my tru&s;ty Servant and Amba&s;&s;ador, to know whether in Your Princely Wi&s;dom You &s;hall think fit to a&s;si&s;t Me with &s;uch Forces by Sea as &s;hall be an&s;werable to tho&s;e I provide by Land, which if You plea&s;e to grant, I doubt not but</HI> The Lord of Ho&s;ts <HI>will protect and a&s;si&s;t tho&s;e that Fight in &s;o glorious a Cau&s;e. Nor ought You to think this &s;trange, that I, who &s;o much reverence the Peace and Accord of Nations, &s;hould exhort to a War. Your Great Prophet</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>was the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> JUDAH, <HI>as well as the</HI> Lord <HI>and</HI> Giver of Peace, <HI>which may &s;ignifie unto You, That he which is a Lover and Maintainer of Peace, mu&s;t al|ways appear with the Terror of his Sword, and wading through Seas of Blood, mu&s;t arrive to Tranquility. This made</HI> JAMES <HI>Your Father of glorious Memory, &s;o happily Renowned among all Nations: It was the Noble Fame of Your Princely Vertues, which re&s;ounds to the utmo&s;t corners of the Earth, that per&s;waded me to invite You to partake of that Ble&s;sing wherein I boa&s;t my &s;elf mo&s;t Happy. I wi&s;h God may heap the Riches of his Ble&s;sings on You, increa&s;e Your Happine&s;s with Your Days, and hereafter perpetuate the Greatne&s;s of Your Name in all Ages.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Streets.</NOTE> that two men can &s;carce go a|brea&s;t in them; yet we mu&s;t except tho&s;e that are adjacent to the Gates of the City. They make them thus narrow, that they may be the more cool, for that the heat is there very violent. The Hou&s;es are but of one Story, all built of Brick and Clay, but plai&s;ter'd and wa&s;hed over with Chalk; having on the out&s;ide neither beauty, nor order of Architecture, yet they are for all that very hand&s;ome within.

And yet for all that, they are no better u&s;ed there, than in all the Parts of Chri&s;tendom: For be&s;ides the Impo&s;ts charged upon them, it's permitted to every one, yea and to the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, to offer them a thou&s;and Affronts. They are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from other men by a Bonnet which they are oblig'd to wear, and which ought to be black, as al&s;o all the re&s;t of their Clothes.</P>
<P>The Circuit of the City is about, by the Walls,

<P>The fir&s;t is that of <HI>Baba&s;on,</HI> which is towards the Ea&s;t: In its Sub|urbs, which is very &s;mall, are wont to lodge the Merchant-<HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs,</HI> which bring Provi&s;ions to the City. It was on this &s;ide that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth batter'd and be&s;ieg'd it. There they put the <HI>Turks</HI> to death; and you at all times &s;ee one or other that is there empal'd, or gauched, as they call it, and &s;et upon the Walls, as we &s;hall &s;hew more at large by and by.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, which they call <HI>Porto-novo,</HI> is of the &s;ame &s;ide, by which one pa&s;&s;eth to <HI>Ca&s;tello del Imperador.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the Gate of the <HI>Alca&s;&s;aw,</HI> &s;o call'd, for that it is near unto that Palace, which is as it were the <HI>Arcenal</HI> and Magazine, wherein they keep all their Ammunition of War.</P>
<P>The fourth is that call'd <HI>Babalowetta,</HI> which looks towards the We&s;t. Be|fore this Gate there is a place which the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> have appointed for the putting of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to death; many of which have, and &s;till do there receive the Crown of Martyrdom, chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer all imaginable Torments, than to renounce the Profe&s;&s;ion of the true God, to embrace the Impieties of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And this is the onely place of the City where they are put to death. Without this Gate is the <HI>Turks</HI> Cemetery, or Burying-place, which is about a League in Compa&s;s; at the end of which, inclining towards the Sea, is that of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and fa&s;t by, that of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which the Sea doth often wa&s;h with its Waves.</P>
<P>The fifth is the <HI>Porta della Mole,</HI> &s;o call'd, for that it looks directly upon it. This Mole is a great Ma&s;s of Stones in the Form of an Half-Moon; the Breadth is about &s;ix or &s;even Paces, and its Length above three hundred. This egregious Structure giveth &s;hape to the Port, where there are u&s;ually above an hundred Ve&s;&s;els for Piracy, and others. It is &s;o un&s;ecure in <HI>Autumn</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> by rea&s;on of an Ea&s;t and by North Winde, that in the Year One thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred and nineteen, there were twenty five Ve&s;&s;els rackt in one
<PB N="223" REF="152">day. This is al&s;o call'd the <HI>Porta della Dogana,</HI> becau&s;e that there the Cu&s;toms are wont to be paid.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t Gate is towards the Sea-&s;ide, directly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> of the Shipping, and is call'd in <HI>la Lingua Franca, La Porta della Pi&s;cade|ria.</HI> Where it is to be noted, that in &s;ome of the&s;e Gates there be always three or four <HI>Turks</HI> for a Guard, with great &s;taffs in their hands, which they do not &s;eldom lay upon the &s;houlders of the poor Slaves, when they pa&s;s that way, which they mo&s;t commonly do in &s;port, but out of a malicious fancy.</P>
<P>There are reckon'd at this day above an hundred Fountains in the City of <HI>Algier,</HI> that have been erected within this twenty five years onely; whereas before they had none but Ci&s;terns. A <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> nam'd <HI>Padron Mou&s;&s;a,</HI> of the Race of tho&s;e who were expell'd <HI>Spain,</HI> in the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ten, and One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eleven, did make them by means of an <HI>Aquaeduct,</HI> which was brought two Leagues from without the City. 'Tis ea&s;ie to believe, that this Work co&s;t much Sweat and Toil to the poor <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slaves, that wrought in the &s;ame without intermi&s;&s;ion during the mo&s;t violent Heats, as they daily do now in making the Mole of the Port.</P>
<P>The Walls of the City are rea&s;onable good, part of Brick,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Walls.</NOTE> and part of Stone, with &s;quare Towers, and certain Ba&s;tions, of which the be&s;t are to|wards the <HI>Baba&s;on Gate,</HI> where there be deep Trenches; and towards the Sea|&s;ide, the Wall &s;tands upon a Rock, again&s;t which the Waves beat.</P>

<P>The &s;econd is call'd <HI>Ca&s;tel-novo,</HI> or <HI>The Seven-corner'd Ca&s;tle;</HI> for that it con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix Angles. This Fortre&s;s is betwixt the Town and <HI>Ca&s;tel del' Impera|dor,</HI> towards the South, about five hundred Paces di&s;tant from the City.</P>

It is kept by eight <HI>Moors,</HI> who &s;tand Centinel along the Mole, and by a dozen more that lye at the Entry thereof in a Boat.</P>

He likewi&s;e keeps his Chan|cellor with the Kings Seal; and in this Chancery are tho&s;e Acts and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es ratifi'd which tho&s;e of that Nation do Tran&s;act among them&s;elves. Which is done for Paying Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> which the Con&s;ul hath power to take upon all the Merchandi&s;es of the People of his Nation that come thither to Trade. But then he is to &s;ecure them at his own Charges, from all the Frauds and Exacti|ons that the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> may chance to offer them. And the &s;ame is pra|cti&s;ed in all the other Pyratick Towns.</P>
<P>&para; WE &s;hall now in order proceed to their <HI>Militia.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Militia.</NOTE> And though at this day the <HI>Janizaries</HI> have the whole Command in <HI>Algier,</HI> yet that man|ner of Government hath not been always &s;uch: for at the time of <HI>Ariadin, Bar|baro&s;&s;a</HI> made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the City, and that his Brother <HI>Cheridine</HI> &s;ucceeded him, they both Commanded ab&s;olutely: but that form of Rule did change among&s;t the People of <HI>Algier</HI> after that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> began to &s;end them <HI>Ba&s;haws,</HI> or Governours: whence it happens &s;ometimes, that this <HI>Militia</HI> flying into Revolts, have &s;et up &s;ome, and driven out others; to which the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> hath not thought fit to give a check, for fear of exa&s;perating them, and wholly diverting them from his Obedience. And this is the rea&s;on why he, being well acquainted with the Di&s;po&s;ition of that People, and the trou|bles that they may procure unto him&s;elf, if he &s;hould u&s;e any Violence again&s;t them, contents him&s;elf to &s;end thither in his Name a <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> that repre&s;ents his Per&s;on, and who onely takes care that nothing be tran&s;acted to the di&s;&s;er|vice of his Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>Whereby you may &s;ee that this <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> or <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> hath all the Honours of State, re&s;erving the Government. And thus the <HI>Militia</HI> hath in&s;en&s;ibly u&s;urped the Soveraign Authority in <HI>Algier:</HI> for how con&s;iderable &s;oever the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> is, he can conclude upon nothing without the advice of the Comman|ders of that <HI>Militia,</HI> nor &s;o much as go to the <HI>Divan</HI> unle&s;s he be &s;ent for.</P>
<P>Upon the whole one may affirm,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is that goodly Mo|del of Government which our <HI>Engli&s;h Janizaries,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmans</HI> introduced a|mong&s;t us in the Winter of <HI>Anno</HI> 1659.</NOTE> that this is at this day a State that Apes a Soveraign, whereas the other <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Beglerbegs,</HI> which Command in the Provinces of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire (excepting, be&s;ides this, tho&s;e al&s;o of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Tripoly</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> Pyratical Cities) are ab&s;olute over the <HI>Janizaries.</HI> But ever &s;ince that the <HI>Militia</HI> of <HI>Algier</HI> is put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sove|raign Authority, nothing doth pa&s;s without the expre&s;s Order of it, which in the Declarations and Edicts it &s;ends forth, doth always &s;peak in the&s;e Terms of high Preheminence:
<Q><HI>WE the Great and Small, the Pui&s;&s;ant and Invincible</HI> Militia <HI>of</HI> Algier, <HI>and of its whole Realm, have Determined and Re&s;olved.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But the better to under&s;tand what concerns this <HI>Militia,</HI> I do think fit to
<PB N="226" REF="154">&s;peak of it fir&s;t in particular, untill we come to &s;peak of its <HI>Divan</HI> and Go|vernment.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider this <HI>Militia,</HI> I fancy it to be like unto a Ba&s;ilisk, which Nature hath crowned for the King of Serpents, but who&s;e Looks are conta|gious and mortal. Even &s;o doth this Mon&s;ter carry Death in its Eyes, &s;o dan|gerous is it to all tho&s;e whom it intends to hurt; and it is onely its violence that hath put the Crown upon its Head.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of Twenty two thou&s;and Men; of which &s;ome are Natural <HI>Turks</HI> of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and Sons of <HI>Turks,</HI> which they call <HI>Couloys,</HI> and the re&s;t Renega|does, or Strangers, or Natives of the Place. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of having al|ways &s;ome Natural <HI>Turks,</HI> to the end the Advantage may be equal betwixt them and the Renegadoes, without either getting the Ma&s;tery of the other. Neverthele&s;s the Renegadoes cannot be Souldiers, or receive Pay in the <HI>Mi|litia,</HI> unle&s;s they be free and franck: that is, unle&s;s they have found out &s;ome means to Redeem them&s;elves, or their Ma&s;ters have conferred on them the Pri|viledge of Freedom: which they &s;ometimes do, when they have been well Served, or when they become Renegadoes at their &s;olicitation: for although a Chri&s;tian Captive do take the <HI>Turban,</HI> and turn <HI>Turk,</HI> yet do they not cea&s;e to be Slaves, unle&s;s he be freed by one of tho&s;e ways.</P>
<P>But if it chance that there remain but few Natural <HI>Turks</HI> in this <HI>Militia,</HI> ei|ther for that they are dead, or for that they are return'd into their Native Countrey, in &s;uch Ca&s;e the new <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> which come from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> bring others along with them, or &s;end for them into the <HI>Levant:</HI> in&s;omuch, that in &s;uch Ca&s;e they take the fir&s;t that come; and very often the poor Shepherds, or &s;uch like, which they train up to handle Arms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> can have no Office in this <HI>Militia,</HI> thereby to prevent the &s;u&s;picion that might ari&s;e, le&s;t that being Natives of the Place, they &s;hould con&s;pire under-hand together, to expell thence the <HI>Turks</HI> and Renegadoes, and a&s;&s;ume the Soveraign Authority into their own hands. Nor are the <HI>Morisks,</HI> who were driven out of <HI>Spain,</HI> admitted to that Priviledge. And if there be occa&s;ion to Enroll a Man, which is mo&s;t commonly done onely in <HI>Algier,</HI> it is the Cu&s;tom to go and find out the <HI>Aga,</HI> who is the Chief of the <HI>Militia,</HI> or the Colonel, or the General, as al&s;o the Clerk to the <HI>Divan,</HI> who do take the Names of tho&s;e that are li&s;ted, and in&s;tantly put them into Pay, which is Four <HI>Doubles</HI> a Moneth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pay.</NOTE> each <HI>Double</HI> being worth Ten <HI>Sols</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. They have moreover each day Four Ammunition-Loaves: but if they be Married, as they may be, they have no Bread, but may dwell in the City with their Family.</P>
<P>This Pay is encrea&s;ed a <HI>Double</HI> by the Moneth, as often as tho&s;e who receive it are found to be in the Field gathering the <HI>Li&s;mes</HI> or Tributes of the <HI>Moors,</HI> or that a new <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> doth come; and as often likewi&s;e as any Male-Child is born unto the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> And thus the &s;aid Pay mounteth, until it come to Forty <HI>Doubles</HI> the Moneth; but can never ri&s;e higher, according to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, for any Officer whatever. And this was Enacted &s;ome years &s;ince, by rea&s;on there was not found Money enough to pay the whole <HI>Militia.</HI> From this <HI>Militia</HI> are drawn forth all the Souldiers of the Garri&s;ons which are di&s;per&s;ed in the Frontier Towns of the Kingdom, which are changed every Six Moneths, and are called the <HI>Pubes;</HI> of which the Bri|gades are compo&s;ed, as hath been &s;aid above.</P>
<P>Now when the que&s;tion is made about Arming a Pyrate-Ship, among&s;t
<PB N="227" REF="154">the other Souldiers, there are con&s;tantly &s;ome of this <HI>Militia,</HI> of which Three or four thou&s;and remain in <HI>Algier</HI> for a Guard to the City, and to &s;erve upon the occa&s;ions that may ari&s;e. As for their Quarter, it is ordinarily in Nine great Hou&s;es, which they call <HI>Ca&s;&s;eria's,</HI> where, or el&s;ewhere they may follow any Trade that they are skill'd in. In which doubtle&s;s, that which doth much encourage them is, that the lea&s;t among them may attain when time &s;hall &s;erve, according to his order of reception, to be the chief Commander of this <HI>Militia;</HI> for they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ri&s;e from Degree to Degree, and from Office to Office, until they come to the Quality of <HI>Aga:</HI> nor can any Favour, or other Con&s;ideration change this method. And becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand this, but by knowing the Degrees and Names of tho&s;e Officers, it is requi&s;ite that I here in&s;ert them, beginning at the lowe&s;t, and a&s;cending to the highe&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">From &s;imple Souldiers and <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are called <HI>Oldachy's,</HI> after a cer|tain time, as their turn comes, they are made <HI>Biquelars,</HI> otherwi&s;e Cooks to the <HI>Divan,</HI> which is the fir&s;t &s;tep to ri&s;e unto the great Offices following. The&s;e <HI>Biquelars</HI> are tho&s;e that in the <HI>Ca&s;&s;eria's,</HI> Garri&s;ons, Camps or Armies, are to take care about providing Meat and Drink for the Officers, and principal Commanders of this <HI>Militia.</HI></P>
<P N="2">From <HI>Biquelars</HI> and Caterers they come to be <HI>Odabachy's,</HI> that is Corpo|rals of Companies, or Commanders of Squadrons, of which the number of Souldiers is not limited; for they con&s;i&s;t &s;ometimes of Ten, and &s;ometimes of Twenty. The&s;e have Six <HI>Doubles</HI> a Moneth for Pay, and expectation of having it augmented to them, as we have &s;aid already; and they wear for a mark of Honour a great Trayle of half a Foot broad, which hangeth down their Backs above a Foot in length, with two long <HI>O&s;trich</HI> Feathers.</P>
<P N="3">From the Charge of <HI>Odabachy's</HI> they ri&s;e to that of <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> or Ca|ptains, which one may know by a piece of Copper Gilt, which they wear up|on their <HI>Turban,</HI> in fa&s;hion of a Pyramid, and a very high Plume.</P>
<P N="4">From <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> or Captains, they come to be <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> which are but Twenty four, and are the chief of the <HI>Divan.</HI></P>
<P N="5">From the quality of <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> they a&s;cend to that of <HI>Aga,</HI> Commander, or Colonel-General of all the <HI>Militia.</HI> They can continue but two Moneths at the mo&s;t in this Charge, and &s;ometimes they change five or &s;ix of them in a day, when they are not judged capable thereof by the <HI>Divan:</HI> in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes there have been Three in a quarter of an hour. But let them be never &s;o unfit for it, yet neverthele&s;s the have all the honour to have pre&s;ided in the <HI>Divan,</HI> although that &s;ometimes they have not been Seated in the Chair of the <HI>Aga,</HI> nor declared &s;uch: and in that ca&s;e the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> is obliged to give each of them a Scarlet Ve&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">After they have pa&s;t the Dignity of <HI>Aga,</HI> they hold the Quality of <HI>Man&s;u|laga's,</HI> that is to &s;ay, they are &s;uch as our <HI>Veterans,</HI> called by the <HI>Romans, Emeriti Milites;</HI> for they are after that no longer obliged to the Function of Souldiers, and yet never cea&s;e as long as they live, to receive Pay, which is about Forty <HI>Doubles,</HI> which amounts to Twenty <HI>Livres</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. But if the <HI>Divan</HI> are to chu&s;e a Generall for the Fields, or for the Fleets, they commonly take him from among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Man&s;ulaga's,</HI> for that they are Men of Experience, and well skilled in matters of War.</P>
<P>Now all that are of the <HI>Militia</HI> are &s;o much e&s;teemed among&s;t them, that they do not make any account of a Man unle&s;s he be a Souldier; although that very often the principal of tho&s;e Officers be Trade&s;men, as Shoemakers, Black-Smiths,
<PB N="228" REF="155">and the like. And there is not any one that dares to &s;trike one of tho&s;e Souldiers, unle&s;s he be one him&s;elf, and unle&s;s he will have his Hand cut off: nay its remarkable, that they are not Cen&s;urable by the <HI>Cady's,</HI> or ordinary Judges, but onely by the <HI>Aga,</HI> or his <HI>Chaia,</HI> that is, his Lieutenant.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;quet and Simiter, are the Arms which they u&s;e to carry, when they go unto the Wars, or to fetch in Contributions, or to play the Pyrates, and not otherwi&s;e. We are to adde here, that of the number of the&s;e <HI>Oldachy's,</HI> or &s;im|ple <HI>Janizaries,</HI> the <HI>Aga</HI> &s;elects Four, which they call <HI>Sotachy's,</HI> who &s;erve for a Guard to the <HI>Ba&s;haw:</HI> and the&s;e have their Lodgings and their Table in his Palace, and withall, the&s;e onely are allowed to wear Simiters; and that they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, they have upon their <HI>Turbans</HI> a kind of little Tower of Gilded Copper, and a very high Plume made of <HI>Herons</HI> Feathers.</P>
<P>That which is very ob&s;ervable in this <HI>Militia,</HI> is, that it being compounded of a great many Men of different Nations, as namely <HI>Turks, Greeks, French, Spaniards, Italians, Flemings, Engli&s;h, Germans,</HI> and others; yet their Policy is for all that &s;o good, that they all live in great Concord, and very rarely Quarrel each other. But if among&s;t them any one chance to lay hand on his Simiter, be it by Rencounter, or otherwi&s;e, with a de&s;ign to &s;trike, then all that be pre|&s;ent are obliged to make in unto him to hinder his doing any more, and to car|ry him to the <HI>Divan</HI> to be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>I will adde here one notable pa&s;&s;age,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An In&s;tance of <HI>Barbari|ans</HI> that reproacheth the uncharitablene&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans.</HI></NOTE> to make it appear how much e&s;teem the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> have for all tho&s;e in general who receive Pay, and are En|rolled in this <HI>Militia.</HI> Some years &s;ince it happened, that among&s;t &s;undry Lions which were Tamed, and went up and down the Streets of <HI>Algier,</HI> there was one which entred into the Court where the <HI>Divan</HI> was &s;itting; and there before the whole A&s;&s;embly he threw him&s;elf at the Feet of the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> and be|gan to fawn upon him, moaning in a &s;orrowful Tone, as if he did complain: The <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> in&s;tantly gue&s;&s;ed, that this Lion &s;uffered hunger, and that having no particular Ma&s;ter, (for he was in common, and lay in the Streets) no one had took care to give him Food: whereupon, by con&s;ent of the <HI>Divan,</HI> he or|dered, that for the time to come, that Lyon &s;hould have the Pay of a <HI>Janizary,</HI> to be employed for his &s;u&s;tenance: but the Lion chancing to die a Moneth af|ter, it was Decreed in full <HI>Divan,</HI> that he &s;hould be &s;olemnly Interred, and car|ried by four <HI>Janizaries,</HI> in memory of that that he had been of their <HI>Militia,</HI> and received Pay as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>&para; THe next thing is their Civil Government, their method of managing affairs of State, which is by the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and <HI>Divan;</HI> yet herein differ they from all other: for the Divine <HI>Plato</HI> &s;peaking of the felicity of States, hath &s;aid with as much rea&s;on as truth, that they would then be happy when the Philo&s;ophers &s;hould be Kings, or Kings would Philo&s;ophate. But the State of <HI>Algier</HI> &s;eemeth directly to oppo&s;e that Doctrine; for that tho&s;e who have the Government thereof have very few of tho&s;e Qualities which are re|quired to Wi&s;dom. And yet neverthele&s;s, as if Fortune had taken up her dwelling in that City, &s;he makes it to grow and pro&s;per from day to day, both in Wealth and Power, if &s;o be one may call that Pro&s;perity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts onely by Vice, and which hath no other Foundation than Tyranny.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Government.</NOTE> to &s;peak properly, is the Council of State, as well of the City, as of the whole Kingdom. It is compo&s;ed of all the Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="155">and &s;its four times a Week; namely, on Saturday, which is the day of the Great <HI>Divan,</HI> Sunday, Munday, and Tue&s;day. The fir&s;t day in the <HI>Alca&s;&s;aw,</HI> and the three others in the great Court of the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI>'s Hou&s;e. He him&s;elf, as great as he is, cannot be pre&s;ent there, unle&s;s he be &s;ent for in the Name of the <HI>Divan,</HI> by is <HI>Chiaus,</HI> or <HI>Hui&s;hers,</HI> who go on purpo&s;e to his Lodgings to adverti&s;e him thereof; and at the foot of the Stairs, where they &s;tay, they &s;a|lute him three times, as if they &s;poke to one that was deaf. I &s;hall next let you &s;ee the Order and Placing of the Officers.</P>
<P N="1">The <HI>Aga,</HI> who is Chief of the Council, and of all the <HI>Militia;</HI> he is &s;eat|ed in the mo&s;t honorable Place, as Pre&s;ident, and propo&s;eth all that is to be put to the Debate, and to be re&s;olv'd on in full A&s;&s;embly. And if the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> be call'd in, he &s;ingly reports his opinion as one of the re&s;t, but can deter|mine of nothing by his Authority.</P>
<P N="2">The Clerk or Secretary of the <HI>Divan,</HI> who writeth all that is there con|cluded, and keepeth a Regi&s;ter thereof.</P>
<P N="3">The twenty four <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> who are Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI> neare&s;t ap|proaching to the Dignity of <HI>Aga.</HI> They are &s;eated in the &s;ame Court along a Gallery, in which each takes his place, according to the Seniority of his Re|ception.</P>
<P N="4">The <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> who may di&s;pute, and give their Votes, as the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">The <HI>Odabachy's,</HI> and &s;ometimes al&s;o the <HI>Man&s;ulaga's,</HI> who are Summon'd when great Affairs of State are under deliberation.</P>
<P N="6">The <HI>Chiaus</HI> of the <HI>Divan;</HI> and the&s;e by the duty of their Charge, are pre&s;ent to execute the Orders and Commands of Council, which for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;even or eight hundred Per&s;ons. For the principal Of|ficers of the <HI>Militia</HI> have their places in it, and all of them that are in Town u&s;e to be pre&s;ent; &s;o that &s;ometimes there will be in this <HI>Divan</HI> above fifteen hundred Per&s;ons; e&s;pecially when all the Officers are there, the <HI>Man&s;ulaga's</HI> and the <HI>Odabachy's</HI> are taken in. The&s;e later, and the <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> who make the greate&s;t number of Councellors of State, and Officers, do &s;tand in the mid&s;t of the Court-yard, each according to his Rank. They continue there &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even hours, in the Sun, in the Rain, and in the Wind, each with his Hands acro&s;s upon one another, without being permitted to al|ter that po&s;ture of them, &s;ave upon &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity; nor to bring thither any Arms, not &s;o much as a Dagger, for fear of any tumult. Tho&s;e who have any bu&s;ine&s;s there, be they <HI>Chri&s;tians, Turks,</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> may &s;tand at the en|trance of the Court, up and down which certain <HI>Chiaus's</HI> pa&s;s to and again with Pots full of Water, to offer tho&s;e to drink that de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>All the Affairs of this <HI>Divan,</HI> are propounded and re&s;olv'd in the <HI>Turki&s;h Tongue;</HI> &s;o that there is a nece&s;&s;ity that all the Officers do under&s;tand and &s;peak it; otherwi&s;e they cannot be admitted into the &s;ame. And this is practi&s;ed among&s;t them, thereby to te&s;tifie how much they value and e&s;teem the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire. And for this cau&s;e it is, that they have always in the <HI>Divan</HI> an Inter|preter of Languages, of which they ordinarily make u&s;e to under&s;tand the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> when they have any Complaint or Petition to pre&s;ent: there being no Nation in that place, which hath not his <HI>Truchment</HI> to explain his thoughts. The&s;e Officers and Councellors of State being in this man|ner a&s;&s;embled, the <HI>Aga</HI> propoundeth with an audible voice that which is then to be debated, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf fir&s;t to the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> if he be pre&s;ent, and to
<PB N="230" REF="156">the twenty four <HI>Ajabachy's:</HI> Which being done, he puts the thing to the Vote of the whole <HI>Divan,</HI> and requires their opinion and re&s;olution in the Ca&s;e; which is taken in this manner.</P>
<P>After that the four Officers, which are call'd <HI>Bachouldala'es,</HI> have heard the Propo&s;al of the <HI>Aga,</HI> they make it to be under&s;tood to the whole <HI>Divan</HI> in a loud voice, without &s;tirring from their places. The word thus pa&s;t unto the la&s;t of the Officers, remounts from one to another, with a &s;trange voice and murmuration, when it happens that the thing doth not plea&s;e the a&s;&s;embly. And that being done, the <HI>Aga</HI> giveth his Determinations according as the Vote was for or again&s;t the Propo&s;al that he made. In the mean time, a|mong&s;t this confus'd variety of Opinions, they ob&s;erve not for the greater part of the time either Order or Law; but are con&s;train'd to conclude the Affair indifferently either with Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice, as it be&s;t plea&s;eth the&s;e goodly Councellors; who being for the mo&s;t part Mechanicks, know not how either to write or read: &s;o that con&s;equently in their ridiculous Advice they are guided onely by the motion of their Pa&s;&s;ion, and of their bruiti&s;h Ignorance; wherein &s;ometimes they fall to hot Conte&s;ts. As parti|cularly upon the Twenty &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred thirty four, there happened to ari&s;e a great Difference betwixt the <HI>Ba|&s;haw,</HI> and the A&s;&s;embly. The noi&s;e thereof was &s;uch, or to &s;ay better, the howlings were &s;o great, that no man ever heard any thing &s;o frightful. In this Commotion they pu&s;ht one the other, with de&s;ign to ru&s;h upon the <HI>Ba|&s;haw;</HI> and &s;eem'd to argue with each other, who &s;hould be the fir&s;t that &s;hould lift up his arm to &s;trike. For it is a Cu&s;tom, that he that beginneth the Tumult, in lifting up his hands which he holdeth acro&s;s in the A&s;&s;embly, is &s;ure, that, whether he have right on his &s;ide or no, he &s;hall be &s;eiz'd on, and put into a Sack, and thrown into the Sea. Which yet did not happen at that time, for that in the end the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and the <HI>Aga</HI> found out a way to appea&s;e the Tumult.</P>
<P>Where it is farther to be noted, that the Women who have Complaints to offer, a&s;&s;emble &s;ometimes to the number of an hundred of their Kin&s;women and Friends, who all veil'd repair to the Gate of the <HI>Divan,</HI> and there cry, <HI>Charala,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> and are very readily heard.</P>
<P>&para; IN the la&s;t place, we will briefly give an Account of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, when he be&s;ieg'd this City; and of the great Lo&s;s he &s;uffer'd therein.</P>
<P>This Prince in the Year One thou&s;and five hundred forty one,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth be&s;ieges <HI>Algier.</HI></NOTE> having Em|barqued upon the Sea an Army of Twenty two thou&s;and Men aboard Eigh|teen Gallies, and an hundred tall Ships, not counting the Barques and Shallops, and other &s;mall Boats, in which he had engaged the principal of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Nobility, with a good number of the Knights of <HI>Maltha;</HI> he was to Land on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> at a Cape call'd <HI>Matifou.</HI> From this Place unto the City of <HI>Algier</HI> a flat Shore or Strand extends it &s;elf for about four Leagues, the which is exceeding favourable to Gallies. There he put a&s;hore with his Army, and in a few days cau&s;ed a Fortre&s;s to be built, which unto this day is call'd <HI>The Ca&s;tle of the Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the City of <HI>Algier</HI> took the Alarm, having in it at that time but Eight hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> and Six thou&s;and <HI>Moors,</HI> poor-&s;pirited men, and un|exerci&s;ed in Martial affairs; be&s;ides it was at that time Fortifi'd onely with
<PB N="231" REF="156">Walls, and had no Out-works: In&s;omuch that by rea&s;on of its weakne&s;s; and the great Forces of the Emperour, it could not in appearance e&s;cape taking. In fine, it was Attaqued with &s;uch Order, that the Army came up to the very Gates, where the Chevalier <HI>de Sauignac,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by Nation, made him&s;elf remarkable above all the re&s;t, by the miracles of his Valour. For having re|pul&s;ed the <HI>Turks,</HI> who having made a Sally at the Gate call'd <HI>Baba&s;on,</HI> and there de&s;iring to enter along with them, when he &s;aw that they &s;hut the Gate upon him, he ran his Ponyard into the &s;ame, and left it &s;ticking deep therein. They next fell to Battering the City by the Force of Cannon; which the A&s;&s;ailants &s;o weakened, that in that great extremity the Defendants lo&s;t their Courage, and re&s;olved to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>But as they were thus intending, there was a Witch of the Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Fleet and Army o|verthrown, and wrack'd by Witchcraft.</NOTE> whom the Hi&s;tory doth not name, which went to &s;eek out <HI>A&s;&s;am Aga,</HI> that Com|manded within, and pray'd him to make it good yet nine Days longer, with a&s;&s;urance, that within that time he &s;hould infallibly &s;ee <HI>Algier</HI> delivered from that Siege, and the whole Army of the Enemy di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;hould be as cheap as Birds. In a word, the thing did happen in the manner as foretold; for upon the Twenty fir&s;t day of <HI>October</HI> in the &s;ame Year, there fell a continual Rain upon the Land, and &s;o furious a Storm at Sea, that one might have &s;een Ships hoi&s;ted into the Clouds, and in one in&s;tant again precipitated into the bottom of the Water: in&s;omuch that that &s;ame dreadful Tempe&s;t was followed with the lo&s;s of fifteen Gallies, and above an hundred other Ve&s;&s;els; which was the cau&s;e why the Emperour, &s;eeing his Army wa&s;ted by the bad Weather, pur&s;ued by a Famine, occa&s;ioned by wrack of his Ships, in which was the greate&s;t part of his Victuals and Ammunition, he was con&s;train'd to rai&s;e the Siege, and &s;et Sail for <HI>Sicily,</HI> whither he Retreated with the mi&s;erable Reliques of his Fleet.</P>
<P>In the mean time that Witch being acknowledged the Deliverer of <HI>Algier,</HI> was richly remunerated, and the Credit of her Charms authorized. So that ever &s;ince Witchcraft hath been very freely tolerated; of which the Chief of the Town, and even tho&s;e who are e&s;teem'd to be of greate&s;t Sanctity among them, &s;uch as are the <HI>Marabou's,</HI> a Religious Order of their Sect, do for the mo&s;t part make Profe&s;&s;ion of it, under a goodly Pretext of certain Revelati|ons which they &s;ay they have had from their Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon tho&s;e of <HI>Algier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But the <HI>Algeriant</HI> will not own it.</NOTE> to palliate the &s;hame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making u&s;e of a Witch in the danger of this Siege, do &s;ay, that the lo&s;s of the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> V. was cau&s;ed by a Prayer of one of their <HI>Marabou's,</HI> named <HI>Cidy Utica,</HI> which was at that time in great Credit, not under the notion of a <HI>Magitian,</HI> but for a per&s;on of a holy life. Afterwards in remembrance of their &s;ucce&s;s, they have erected unto him a &s;mall <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> with|out the <HI>Baba&s;on</HI> Gate, where he is buried, and in which they keep &s;undry Lamps burning in honour of him: nay they &s;ometimes repair thither to make their <HI>Sala,</HI> for a te&s;timony of greater Veneration.</P>
<P>Here one thing very well merits our ob&s;ervation,

And when they go out to fetch Contribution, though they be all Foot-Soul|diers, yet are they allow'd Hor&s;es as well as their Officers; onely with this difference, the Commanders have Slaves to look to their Hor&s;es, which the others may not.</P>
<P>When they draw out of <HI>Algier,</HI> they Rendezvouz about the City, lying in Tents till they meet together.</P>
<P>But when they march, they commonly have their Allowance of Bread, with a little Oyl, Vinegar, Rice, and Cou&s;cous. What other Provi&s;ions they will have, they mu&s;t buy with their own Money; but that they take no great care for, as well enough knowing how to fetch Victuals abundantly from the <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Moors.</HI> The greate&s;t gain tho&s;e Companiess make, ari&s;eth from the O&s;tridge Feathers they bring from the Wilderne&s;&s;es in the South, which upon their return they &s;ell very dear.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> or Pyrates, the be&s;t account that can be given of them, is from the great number of their Ships wherewith they put to Sea; which amount to thirty five in all: A Li&s;t of which, with the Names of the pre|&s;ent Commanders as they were in the Year 1668. and what each Ship carries in her Stern, with the number of Guns, we have here in&s;erted, as followeth.</P>

<P>In <HI>Ca&s;&s;an</HI> are two yearly Fairs, whither come a great concour&s;e of People to buy and &s;ell all &s;orts of Wares, nay Gold it &s;elf. The <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Mulata's</HI> that &s;catteringly inhabit by the River &s;ide, &s;end their Slaves into the Countrey with Iron and Beads, to buy Hides and Ivory, which they carry on their Heads, and bring to the River.</P>

<P>The manner of dealing between the&s;e People and the before-mentioned <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Trade is driven by the People of <HI>Taye.</HI></NOTE> in exchange of their Goods, is this: They of <HI>Barbary</HI> go to an appoint|ed place, where they lay their Wares in &s;everal heaps, di&s;tinct one from the other; which done, they go away and return not for a whole day: in the mean times the Natives come, and lay over again&s;t every heap as much Gold as they value the Parcels at, then go away, leaving on the place both their own Gold and the Merchants Goods; who upon his return finding that he hath his value in Gold, takes it away and leaves his Merchandi&s;e; but if he expects more, he divides his heaps, and lets them &s;o remain; which the People &s;eeing, lay more Gold, or if they think not fit to give more, they take that away which they laid there fir&s;t: thus in three times the Bargain is driven and ended. The rea&s;on why the People will not be &s;een, is the loath&s;omne&s;s of their Bodies; for their lower Parts, through the exce&s;&s;ive &s;corching of the Sun, are always raw and &s;ore, in &s;uch manner, that if it were not for &s;prinkling them with Salt, they would rot; and that is the cau&s;e why they &s;o much de&s;ire Salt.</P>
<P>&para; <HI>TInda</HI> yields great abundance of Hides, but the trouble, and almo&s;t im|po&s;sibility of coming up the River with great Ve&s;&s;els, very much hinder Trade; be&s;ides Iron bears not &s;o good a Rate there as in other places, becau&s;e the Inhabitants &s;ay, they have Ore thereabouts, of which they can make it: But Salt is a mo&s;t de&s;irable Commodity, not onely there, but in|deed over all the Countrey. At the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the&s;e Places they carried thither a bad and blacki&s;h Salt, which went off well enough; but &s;ince the People have gained skill and knowledge &s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h, that they will not deal for it, but onely for the white&s;t; in exchange whereof they give Slaves, Hides, Elephants Teeth, Cotton, Cotton-Yarn, Cotton-Cloathes, and Gold.</P>
<P>In the City <HI>Joliet,</HI> lying beyond <HI>Tinda,</HI> there is, as the <HI>Blacks</HI> relate, abun|dance of Gold; and the like at a Place call'd <HI>Munkbar:</HI> whither al&s;o the <HI>Arabi|ans</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> come, with Camels laden with Salt, and all &s;orts of Merchandi&s;es, which they barter onely for Gold.

The third had a Bank that hin|der'd the coming in of Ships. Three or four miles upward lay a low Land full of Lemon-Trees, who&s;e Fruits, notwith&s;tanding it was in the time of the Rain, hung mo&s;t of them ripe upon the Trees. The fourth was a &s;mall River with|in the Point of the I&s;land <HI>Sombreras,</HI> who&s;e Water is deep and Salt; where the Sea-men, coming on Shore, found Crocodiles, Turtles, and Oi&s;ters on the Trees.</P>

<P>Twelve miles upward of <HI>Gambea,</HI> being as far as it is Navigable with &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, lies a Place call'd <HI>Kancho,</HI> in the height of &s;even Degrees, being very low Land; whereto adjoyn &s;ome I&s;lands.</P>

<P>The <HI>Netherland Ea&s;t.

<P>The I&s;lands of <HI>Sombreras</HI> produce many Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, Palmito-Trees of &s;everal &s;orts, which afford the Inhabitants Wine, Palm-Oyl, and

<P>The other Commodities are Wax, Ivory, and Long-Pepper, by the <HI>Portu|gals</HI> call'd <HI>Pimenta del Kola,</HI> and Tail-Pepper, or <HI>Pimenta del Rab.</HI> Both the&s;e &s;orts are taken to be much better than the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Pepper; but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath prohibited the Importing it into his Countrey, that the Trade of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Pepper may not be &s;poiled, which brings them &s;uch great Profit: However, the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders, French,</HI> and other People that Trade in this Countrey, bring it over, but the <HI>Portugals</HI> barter it on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinee,</HI> in exchange for Gold, Slaves, Provi&s;ion, and other things, according as the Pla|ces wherein they Trade differ or vary.</P>

The <HI>Blacks</HI> re|port it to be of humane Extract; but by the alteration and change of the Woods and the Wilderne&s;s, it is become half a Bea&s;t. They &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves in the Woods with Fruit and wild Honey, which they get out of the Trees: and as they are not few, &s;o when they meet, continually fight one with the other.

Some of the Antients, knowing the fiercene&s;s of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods: but here, in regard he hurts no Man, but onely Bea&s;ts, they make the Leopard the King of the Woods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Cu&s;toms are u&s;ed upon the taking of a Leo|pard.</NOTE> becau&s;e he is more dangerous. For this ravening they are hunted and kill'd by all that can, even for their own &s;afety: yet when a Leopard is kill'd, they bring him dead unto the King's Town, there to be cut up and eaten; but if the Re&s;iants there be not acquainted with it before-hand, they will not ad|mit it without great oppo&s;ition; and therefore, with Weapons in their hands, every man falls upon the bringers of the Leopard, who come al&s;o Armed to abide the expected brunt: Thus meeting, they fight eagerly, till one &s;ide be|come ab&s;olute Victors: which for the mo&s;t part are the King's Men, to whom the Leopard is left as a booty; which they commonly draw into the Town, &amp; with extraordinary mirth convey to the place where they u&s;e to exhibit their Sports: where being flea'd, his Skin and Teeth they pre&s;ent to the King: but the People a&s;&s;embled eat the Fle&s;h boyl'd as a great Dainty; &s;pending the re|mainder of the day in Revelling and Dancing, as at their mo&s;t &s;olemn Fe&s;ti|vals.

<P>If any take a liking to a Woman brought by the Merchants from a foreign Countrey, with a purpo&s;e to Marry her, he makes known his Suit by Pre&s;ents after their manner: And the like, as we &s;aid, if any man ca&s;t his affection upon a Maid, who is not re&s;erved for &s;ome other Per&s;on; but if &s;he be &s;et apart by agreement or promi&s;e, they admit no hearing to any other: but the intended Bridgroom invites the Maid in the Evening to come to his Hou&s;e, to eat and drink; which, if &s;he &s;tands upon her honour, &s;he takes no notice of three or four times; but at la&s;t goes with her Friends, and after that the &s;olemnity is concluded, the Bride remains &s;ometimes ten or twelve days before &s;he ask for her Bride-Pre&s;ents, if they live both in one Village; but if the Maid come from the Countrey, and her acquaintaince which have brought her thither, would go away, then &s;he asks for them before their departure.

After the Marriage thus perfected in this manner, yet the Man mu&s;t gratifie the Parents, and Maids Companions with &s;ome Gifts; which &s;ometimes they retaliate: But to take many Pre&s;ents from the Womans Parents, turns greatly to his prejudice: for if it happen that the Wife had rather have another Man, or that the Hus|band will turn her to her Parents, thenceforth all the Pre&s;ents given to him are demanded back, but what-ever he hath be&s;towed on her or them, they keep; for he mu&s;t do no injury to the Woman, nor to her Parents: But if the Wife will be reconciled, &s;he may; for it is at her choi&s;e, becau&s;e the Parents may not force or compel her.

After half an hours playing in that manner, the Name-giver taking the Child from the Mother, layeth it down upon a Shield in the mid&s;t of the Concour&s;e, and puts a little Bowe, made for that purpo&s;e, into its hand; then he makes a Speech above half an hour long over the Child, admoni&s;hing it to be as he is, and to follow his example, to be diligent in Tillage and Husbandry, that he may get much Rice, that he may give to every one to eat that ask it, and thereby to get a prai&s;e-worthy Name; not to covet after another Man's Wife, nor to deceive, or cheat, or be treacherous, whereby a Man, &s;ays he, &s;hall come to &s;corn and contempt. This &s;olemnity being ended, he brings the Child to the Mother again: afterwards they mu&s;t go a Hunting, while others provide Wine: after Noon they return home with the Bea&s;t they have caught, of which, boil'd with Rice, they make a Fea&s;t; and &s;o, with the Women make them&s;elves merry, and frolick the greate&s;t part of the Night.</P>
<P>But the &s;olemnity at naming a Daughter is not &s;o great; for a Woman, with &s;ome few attendants, fetch the Child out of the Mothers Hou&s;e, and lay it upon a Mat, among&s;t the re&s;t, putting a Stick in its Hand, admoni&s;hing it to be dili|gent and indu&s;trious, to wa&s;h it &s;elf clean, for that cleanne&s;s is an ornament to a Woman; to be cha&s;te and mode&s;t, not to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> from one Man to another, le&s;t

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eakotima, that is, the de|parture or Funeral.</NOTE> or by Mi&s;|chance, pre&s;ently all his Friends and Acquaintance meet, and encom|pa&s;&s;ing the Corp&s;e, &s;ing Elegies and Epicediums, wherein they &s;et forth at large the Prai&s;es and Actions of the Decea&s;ed in &s;everal Languages, every one chu&s;ing that wherein he thinks him&s;elf be&s;t skill'd and able with mo&s;t Excel|lency to expre&s;s his fancy; for be&s;ides their own <HI>Quoian,</HI> they can all &s;peak the <HI>Timnian, Hondrian, Mendian, Folgian, Galaan,</HI> and <HI>Gebbian</HI> Tongues.</P>
<P>For they account it a great Honour to have &s;uch a Funeral-Elegy compos'd and &s;poken in a high Strain and lofty Stile: And if any that have no continu|al or publick Employment, happen at &s;uch a time to neglect to &s;hew his Love to his decea&s;ed Friend or Relation, by &s;uch a Valedictory Gratulation, all his &s;urviving Kindred and Acquaintance will exclaim again&s;t him, as one that merits not their kindne&s;s living, who will not joyn to lament for them dead.</P>
<P>After the Funeral-Orations are fini&s;h'd, the Corp&s;e is wa&s;hed, the Hair pleated, and the Body &s;et upright, &s;upported with &s;tayes at the Back, and un|der the Arms. If it be a Man, then they put a Bowe and Arrow into his hand, and array him with his be&s;t Garment, and his Friends bring Pre&s;ents to the Funeral; <HI>viz.</HI> one Needles; another a Kettle or Ba&s;on; the third a Garment; a fourth Di&s;hes, and Earthen and Tin Cups.</P>
<P>The Corp&s;e thus &s;et up and dre&s;t, &s;ome of his neare&s;t Kin&s;men come and play with Bowes and Arrows before him; and that done, kneel down with their backs turn'd to the Corp&s;e, and draw the Bowe-&s;tring as far as they can, to &s;ignifie, that they would fight again&s;t his Enemy; and if he were &s;lain in the Wars, or kill'd by any malicious Per&s;on, they would with &s;uch force take vengeance.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, a Man or a Woman is left by the Corp&s;e to keep it, and take care to beat away the Flies, and Vermine which otherwi&s;e might annoy the body.</P>
<P>When the neare&s;t Relations have fini&s;h'd their Ceremonies, and come from the hou&s;e, immediately &s;ome Women of her Acquaintance apply them&s;elves to the Widow to lament and condole with her; and falling down at her feet, u&s;e the&s;e words, <HI>Bqun e, Bqun e,</HI> that is, <HI>Be comforted,</HI> or <HI>Cea&s;e your lamentation.</HI> After the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e &s;orrowful Complaints, the men carry the Corp&s;e upon a Biere to the Grave, commonly made near the Sepulchres of their Ance&s;tors, in &s;ome <HI>Tombouroi,</HI> or de&s;olate Village, and there inhume it not above knee-deep; ca&s;ting into the Ground after him Mats, Kettles, Ba&s;ons, Beads, or what other Wealth he po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf with, or was pre&s;ented after his death, and then fill up the Hole with Earth, covering it over with a painted Mat fa&s;ten'd with Pins, and an Iron; clo&s;e by &s;etting up a Pole, whereon (if it be a Mans Corp&s;e) they hang his Clothes and Arms in the manner of a Trophy; but if it were a Woman, &s;ome Pewter Porringers or Di&s;hes are made fa&s;t with a Pin to the Ground: And with all convenient &s;peed the Friends erect a Hut over the Grave, as a defence from the Rain, and al&s;o for a Monument, that their Memories may not altogether be forgotten.</P>
<P>The Kings Kindred are buried in an I&s;land call'd <HI>Ma&s;ach,</HI> lying in a Lake belonging to the River <HI>Plizoge,</HI> where King <HI>Flans-Sire,</HI> Father of the pre&s;ent Reigning King <HI>Flambore,</HI> in his life kept his Royal Seat, and now lies En|tomb'd.</P>
<P>If any of the Friends have been ab&s;ent, or in a Journey, upon his return he comes to the Hou&s;e of the Deceas'd, though it be two or three moneths after;
<PB N="396" REF="250">and falling down at the feet of the neare&s;t Kin&s;man to the Deceas'd, bewails his lo&s;s. If he meets any of his Acquaintance of the near Friends to the De|ceas'd, he embraces him, and &s;alutes him with the&s;e words, <HI>Clau e, Clau e,</HI> that is, <HI>Lament, Lament;</HI> and then talk together of their Affairs.</P>
<P>When any Nobleman dies, one or two of his Slaves or Slave&s;&s;es are put to death at the Grave, to be his Attendants in the <HI>Elizian Fields;</HI> others wait at the Grave, to whom the Friends of the Dead carry Pre&s;ents of Bracelets, Beads, Coral, Rice, Tobacco, the Fruit <HI>Kola,</HI> and a Hen boil'd with Rice, which they may di&s;po&s;e as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Though this de&s;troying and killing of Slaves and Slave&s;&s;es was an old Cu|&s;tom here, yet it is not much practis'd of late; and tho&s;e of the Slaves that can run away, or defend them&s;elves with weapons in their hands, are free: Therefore when an Eminent Per&s;on is dying, all his Slaves get away where they cannot be found, though the danger of their Lords Death is conceal'd as much as po&s;&s;ible. The Run-away-Slaves when they come again, are rail'd at and upbraided with the&s;e or &s;uch like words: <HI>You will eat of your Lords Co&s;t, but not die with him;</HI> who excu&s;e them&s;elves, &s;aying, <HI>Life is &s;weet, and no man would willingly leave or have it taken away again&s;t his will.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t of the Friends at the beginning of the Mourning make a Vow of Ab&s;tinence, &s;wearing by a holy Token, which they call <HI>Bolly-Gowe,</HI> with lifting up of hands, that they will keep it; for a common Per&s;on eight or ten days, and for a Lord, a moneth, or longer; in which time they may not eat any Rice, nor drink out of any whole Ve&s;&s;el or Cup, but onely out of a Pot|&s;heard, or a little hole made in the ground; neither do the Men &s;leep with their Wives, nor may wear any Painted or Colour'd Clothes, but onely Black or White, cut with fla&s;hes, &s;having their Hair, and &s;leep upon the bare ground.</P>
<P>When the time is expired, they come to the <HI>Bolly-Gowe,</HI> and di&s;charge them|&s;elves with up-lifted Hands from the afore&s;aid Promi&s;e and Vow, with a&s;&s;u|rance that they have kept the &s;ame. La&s;tly, a Funeral-Banquet is prepared; for which the Women boyl Rice, and the Men go into the Woods a Hunting, and bring home what they catch, which they boyl and eat, and &s;o the whole Ceremony concludes.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that have fa&s;ted are gratifi'd with Pre&s;ents, every one according to his quality; that is, common per&s;ons, one with a Ba&s;on, another with a little <HI>Garment,</HI> or Salt-Basket, or a piece of Iron or Mat; but per&s;ons of account, with a Staff; Iron, or other Goods, which with them are highly e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>If the acquaintance of the Decea&s;ed have any &s;u&s;picion that he died not a natural Death, they neither wa&s;h the Dead, nor lament, till the doubt be re&s;olved; for they &s;ay, if any &s;hould mourn before, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to bring to light the guilty per&s;on, becau&s;e the Spirit of Envy over-hearing it, would not give any intimation of it.</P>
<P>The Enquiry is performed in thismanner: They take the Corps, or in &s;tead of that, a piece of his Cloathes, with pairings of his Nails, and &s;ome of his Hair, &s;ewing it up like a Pudding, mixed with &s;crapings of <HI>Bondu,</HI> or red Dying-wood: this Roll they put into a <HI>Mortar,</HI> where they &s;tamp it. Then two eloquent Men are elected, who &s;tand with two Iron Bills or Halberds be|fore the Staff-bearers, and cla&s;hing their Bills, ask the Dead what he died of; and whether God took him away or no: if yea, then the Staff-bearers nod, as if they were half a&s;leep; but if not, they &s;hiver and &s;hake. In like manner
<PB N="397" REF="250">they do upon the other Que&s;tion of <HI>Who did it? Where is he?</HI> and, <HI>In what man|ner was it done?</HI> At length they receive an&s;wer, that he died a violent Death, being kill'd by &s;ome <HI>Bolly;</HI> for <HI>Bolly</HI> is with them all manner of Medicinal Herbs, but the Herb that is venomous or poy&s;onous, is call'd <HI>Sovach.</HI> But if <HI>Bolly</HI> hath kill'd him, then the Names of mo&s;t Phy&s;ical Herbs are recited, till they have found which of them was u&s;ed; concluding however at la&s;t, that <HI>So|vach</HI> hath kill'd him. Then is asked whether he was kill'd by a Man or a Wo|man: and at la&s;t is asked concerning the place of his dwelling, and per&s;on. The guilty per&s;on being found, immediately they are chained to a great Block, and asked if he or &s;he will acknowledge the Fact. If they can be brought to no acknowledgment, then is given to them <HI>Quony;</HI> or el&s;e, upon acknowledg|ment of the Fact, are cruelly put to death.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quony</HI> is a Rind, or Bark of a Tree &s;o call'd, which in the pre&s;ence of Friends, by the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, is pull'd off, that the Sap or Juice may be u&s;ed without any deceit. The outermo&s;t &s;curf of the Bark they pare off, and beat in a Mortar with Water, which after the &s;etling affords a very tart Juice; of which they give to tho&s;e that are taken, three or four <HI>Kalaba&s;jes,</HI> or Quarts, to drink in the Morning, and not at any other time. In the mean time they conjure and per&s;wade them&s;elves, that if the Captive be guilty of the Crime, he will die, or el&s;e not: At la&s;t, vomiting the <HI>Quony,</HI> he is held to be quit; but if he cannot do that, though at fir&s;t he brings up a little Froth, he dies; and the Body is either burnt, or el&s;e ca&s;t into the River.</P>
<P>But if it happen that they cannot receive any an&s;wer, or but &s;uch as is un|certain and Amphibological, re&s;ting thereon, though with much di&s;&s;atisfa|ction, they forthwith, without farther enquiry, interre the Corps: Yet never|thele&s;s, they go to a <HI>Jakehmo,</HI> or Sooth&s;ayer; a vagrant &s;ort of People, who have no certain Dwelling-place, but rove up and down; and before they an&s;wer any que&s;tion, run about di&s;tractedly, one with a certain kind of Pots, or Cups; another &s;ounding a Horn; the re&s;t with Tabers, or little Drums, making a great noi&s;e and hurliburly, &s;eeking, and calling for the <HI>Sovahmo;</HI> from whom, when they have received any information concerning the guilty per&s;on, then they proceed to the trial with the <HI>Quony,</HI> in the manner afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>&para; IN Right of Inheritance, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of Goods, this method is ob&s;erved:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance.</NOTE> When the Man dies, and leaves behind him &s;ome Children that are un|der Age, the elder Brother takes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Slaves, Wives, Children, moveable and not moveable Goods of his Father, except his own Mother. Thus taking upon him&s;elf the government of the Family, after time of mourn|ing fini&s;hed, he draws to the place of Exerci&s;es before the King, in pre&s;ence of all his acquaintance, with his Father's Bowe in his hand, and his Quiver of Arrows at his back, one end of the Bowe he &s;ets upon the Ground, holding the other end in his hand; in that po&s;ture he declareth openly, that re&s;olving to be valiant, and to follow his Father's cour&s;e, he will now give a proof be|fore all the Spectators. After he hath &s;hewed his skill and activity, he pre|&s;ents him&s;elf before the King in the &s;ame po&s;ture as before, &s;aying, <HI>He is re&s;ol|ved to bear the burthen of his Family, to give the Children under Age an Example, to Till the Ground, to defend the Right of his Family, and what el&s;e befits him.</HI></P>
<P>After the Decea&s;e of this Son, the next elde&s;t Brother takes all. But if the elde&s;t Son live, and have Children, then his younger Brothers and their Chil|dren have onely &s;o much of the E&s;tate, as &s;hall keep them till they come to
<PB N="398" REF="251">Manhood, and maintain the Slaves or Slave&s;&s;es given him in his Father's life|time: for it is the cu&s;tom in that Countrey, that people of ability be&s;tow up|on their Children, as well Sons as Daughters, from their Infancy &s;ome Slaves.</P>
<P>But if the Father dies, leaving onely Daughters, either his Father's Brother, if living, or el&s;e his Father's Brother's Son, that the Name may not be extinct, &s;hall inherit.</P>
<P>But if there be no Male-i&s;&s;ue of the Father's &s;ide, the King is Heir, and takes as well Slaves as Goods and Women to him, allowing a &s;ufficient mainte|nance to &s;ome tru&s;ty Per&s;on for the bringing up of the Children.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Strength and Power.</NOTE> is at pre&s;ent &s;upported more by Wi&s;dom and Policy, than by Power; becau&s;e the &s;ubjected Countreys of <HI>Cilm, Bolm,</HI> and <HI>Bolmberre,</HI> are accounted more powerful than it.

<P>&para; WE will next proceed to their Government;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government.</NOTE> and fir&s;t begin with <HI>Quoia-Bercoma,</HI> at pre&s;ent Commanded by a King, with the Title of <HI>Don|dagh,</HI> his Name <HI>Flamboere</HI> the Fourth, Grand&s;on of one <HI>Bokwalla,</HI> formerly Prince of the <HI>Karou's,</HI> who by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Folgians</HI> conquering the <HI>Veyes</HI> after a tedious War, laid here the Foundations of a Potent Monarchy to his Succe&s;&s;ors; invited thereto by the fertility of the Soil, and an innate ambition and thir&s;t of Soveraignty.

<P>This King, like his Ance&s;tors, holds in &s;ubjection <HI>Folgia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Quoia</HI> holds &s;ubject the <HI>Folgia's.</HI></NOTE> the Region of <HI>Cape de Monte,</HI> and the adjacent places formerly belonging to the people <HI>Vey</HI> and <HI>Puy;</HI> whereupon the Heir of the Crown, when the King dies, requires Earth from the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Folgia</HI> in token of Acknowledgement, and In&s;talls the Lord of <HI>Bolmberre</HI> with the Title of <HI>Dondagh,</HI> by a particular Ceremony; of which we &s;hall give this brief Account.</P>

<P>The Power of the pre&s;ent <HI>Quoian</HI>-Prince is ab&s;olute and unlimited; &s;o that he is the onely and &s;ole Judge of all Cau&s;es: For although he admit his Coun|&s;ellors &s;ometimes to give their Opinions, yet they &s;ignifie nothing, for he fol|lows his own &s;ingle re&s;olved Determinations.</P>
<P>This ab&s;olute Power makes him jealous of his Honor: For, he will not en|dure it &s;hould be dimini&s;hed by any. His highe&s;t Pomp con&s;i&s;ts in &s;itting upon a Shield, whereby he gives to under&s;tand, that he is the Protection and De|fence of the Countrey, and the manager of all Wars, pacifying Civil In&s;ur|rections, and other Weighty Matters belonging to him alone.

<P>The high times of Sacrificing are kept among them with great Joy, Dan|cing and Singing. But be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;olemn times, the King calls upon the Souls of his Father and Mother almo&s;t in every Matter of difficulty.</P>
<P>They believe the Spirits of their near acquaintance are protectors of their Hou&s;es, and therefore in all Sorrow and Sickne&s;s they bring Wine and Food out of their Hou&s;es into the Way, and there leave it for an Offering.</P>
<P>They &s;ay farther, that the&s;e Spirits have their habitation in the Woods: whereupon all that are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and look for help from God by them, go thither, complaining and lamenting their affliction; but with awful reverence: for how great &s;oever any man is, yet he fears very much in the pre&s;ence of God. For this cau&s;e all acts of Devotion are performed in tho&s;e &s;olitary Re|ce&s;&s;es; into which no Women or Children may be permitted to come.</P>
<P>In this Place twice; thrice, or oftner in the year, according to the fruitful|ne&s;s of the Sea&s;on, and when Hunting is good, all &s;orts of Meat-offerings are brought to feed the Spirits.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumci&s;ion.</NOTE> and that God hath commanded it.</P>
<P>They Circumci&s;e Children at half a year old, though &s;ometime, by the Mothers tenderne&s;s, they are kept to the &s;econd or third year; but then the Cure proves more difficult, becau&s;e the Children going naked, the Air and Sun make the Cut &s;well and fe&s;ter; which they heal by wa&s;hing with the Juice of green Herbs.</P>
<P>They have together with Circumci&s;ion another Cu&s;tom, which they call <HI>Belli-Paaro,</HI> whereby they &s;ay they become incorporated into the &s;ociety of Spirits, and therefore take part with them in eating the before-mention'd Offerings. But this is kept hidden from Women, and unskilful per&s;ons; to whom they affirm, that the <HI>Jaananen,</HI> or Spirits them&s;elves eat it: And if any

<P>The received Tokens of <HI>Belli-Paaro</HI> are &s;eldom &s;hewn, <HI>viz.</HI> once in twenty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it is done.</NOTE> or five and twenty years, and then they tell &s;trange Stories of it, and how they came to the high favour of receiving them: which are nothing el&s;e but &s;ome rows of Cuts, from the Neck along both the Shoulder-blades.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they are.</NOTE> Tho&s;e that have them are accounted very under&s;tanding per&s;ons: and when they grow old, in all A&s;&s;emblies and Councils, relating to State-Affairs, or Cau&s;es Criminal, wherein Life is concern'd, may be pre&s;ent, and give their opinion.</P>
<P>Of the manner of receiving the&s;e Marks, take this &s;hort account:</P>
<P>There is by the Kings order a place in the Wood appointed of about two or three miles compa&s;s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are received in the Wood.</NOTE> whither are brought the Youths that have not been Marked, by main force and again&s;t their wills, becau&s;e they believe they &s;hall be kill'd or chang'd; and therefore they take a &s;orrowfull farewell of their Friends and Parents, as if they went indeed to their death.</P>
<P>When now they are lodged in the Wood, continually &s;ome Ancient per|&s;ons which have had the Tokens of <HI>Belli-Paaro</HI> very long, attend to teach and in&s;truct them what behavior they &s;hall u&s;e; leading them a &s;trange and <HI>uncouth</HI> Dance, and cau&s;ing them to learn &s;ome <HI>Ver&s;es</HI> which they call <HI>Belli-Dong,</HI> being Songs and Encomiums of <HI>Belli,</HI> &s;tuffed with ob&s;cene and &s;currulous lan|guage.</P>
<P>Hither the women bring Rice, <HI>Bonano's,</HI> and all &s;ort of Fruit, prepared for an Offering, and give it up to the <HI>Soggonoe,</HI> that is, the <HI>Anciente&s;t Marked,</HI> whom the women hold for Saints, praying them by all means to hinder that their Children in the change &s;hould not be burnt to a&s;hes. Thither al&s;o goes the King, and &s;tays two or three days.</P>
<P>This living in the Wood continues four or five years; during which time there are new comers daily brought thither.</P>
<P>None unmark'd may come near this place, onely women in manner before mention'd, and they too mu&s;t come and go &s;inging with a loud noi&s;e; for if it fall out that any pa&s;s by &s;ilently, they are taken away by the Spirits, without ever being heard of more.</P>
<P>When they come out of this Wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they do when they come out of the Wood.</NOTE> they are brought by the <HI>Belli-Soggonoe</HI> into Huts made for that purpo&s;e, where they are permitted to eat and drink familiarly with the women, and afterwards are anew in&s;tructed in cau&s;es which concern the Wars, Ju&s;tice, and Government.</P>
<P>At their fir&s;t coming abroad, they behave them&s;elves as if they then came newly into the world, not knowing (or at lea&s;t wi&s;e &s;o pretending) where their Parents dwell, and &s;o totally changed, that they have forgot their Names; nor indeed do they the meane&s;t or mo&s;t common act of Childhood, without being fir&s;t tutor'd therein by the <HI>Soggonoe.</HI></P>
<P>At this their beginning appearance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are clothed when they come out of the Wood.</NOTE> they are habited with Plumes of Fea|thers, and Caps made of the Bark of Trees, with long flappets hanging down before their Faces. After &s;ome days &s;tay in the Huts, in &s;uch array, with Bells about their Legs, and Beads mixt with Leopards Teeth about their Necks, and their Hair plaited, they are brought openly to the Sporting-place, where the women and other people of all &s;orts, of all Towns and Villages lying round about, are gathered together to &s;ee them Dance the <HI>Belli-Dance,</HI> the po&s;tures whereof they learned in the Wood.</P>

<P>After the end of the Dance, every one call'd by his new name, receiv'd in the <HI>Holy Wood</HI> from the <HI>Soggenoe,</HI> is delivered to his Parents with the&s;e words, <HI>The&s;e are your Parents or Tutors, learn hereafter to know one another again.</HI></P>

<P>But the Trial of Adultery by this kind of Oath,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Adjuration in ca&s;e of Adultery.</NOTE> is made by the Magi&s;trate after many Pre-admonitions, and inflicted onely upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing Wo|man, according to this Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The complaining Husband, who will have his Wife tryed by <HI>Belli,</HI> or be deliver'd up to the Spirits, as they call them; brings her in the Evening into the Sporting-place, before the Council a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e; where af|ter the calling of the <HI>Jannanen</HI> into her company, &s;he is blindfolded, that &s;he may &s;ee nothing, and admoni&s;h'd to for&s;ake her evil life, and not go to any but her own Husband; and pre&s;ently a great noi&s;e and murmure is rais'd, as if Spirits did appear, with &s;ome not intelligible (though articulate) Sounds, that are interpreted aloud before the whole Congregation, with threatnings, that if ever &s;he commit &s;uch an offence again, &s;he &s;hall be puni&s;h'd according to her de&s;erts; and if &s;he be ever thereafter detected of the like Crime, &s;he &s;hall, together with her Paramour, be carried away by the <HI>Jannanen.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, &s;ome are adjur'd for breaking the Decrees made by the King, or the Magi&s;trate, for Bloud&s;hed, and for taking away the Slave of an|other, and &s;elling him, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>Now this taking away of Offenders by the <HI>Jannanen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Offenders are car|ried away by the <HI>Jannanen.</HI></NOTE> is made terrible by this means; In the Evening with a great ru&s;hing noi&s;e comes into the Town, their <HI>Belli.

During the time of this Performance, no Woman or unmark'd per&s;on may look out of the hou&s;e, upon pain of being fetcht from thence in like manner.</P>

<P>And though it is apparent enough,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How highly <HI>Belli</HI> is e|&s;teem'd by them.</NOTE> what it is to be kill'd by <HI>Belli,</HI> for that
<PB N="405" REF="256">the Execution of <HI>Belli</HI> is but the Kings Form of Ju&s;tice; yet no man dares for fear of Death, take upon him to interrupt it: For the <HI>Belli-Soggenoe</HI> hold this Ceremony to be &s;o Sacred, and have it in &s;uch high e&s;teem, that the King him&s;elf (who is as it were the Head of <HI>Belli</HI>) declares him&s;elf his Va&s;&s;al, and to be &s;ubject to his My&s;teries. Indeed he takes care in the Council,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are free from <HI>Belli.</HI></NOTE> that none be adjur'd by <HI>Belli,</HI> nor that the <HI>Jannanen</HI> take away any without his know|ledge or con&s;ent; onely inflicting that Puni&s;hment upon his own Subjects, though &s;ometimes a few have dar'd to re&s;i&s;t it, and fly into another Province rather than &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>And here we may ob&s;erve, that none is given up to the <HI>Jannanen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water to know if any be guilty or not guilty.</NOTE> but with good Con&s;ideration, and upon clear Evidence of Guilt; to prove which, they have a Water of Cur&s;ing, boyl'd of Barks and Herbs, which by the Elders of the My&s;tery is put upon the hand of the charg'd Party lukewarm; if he be innocent, it will not hurt; but will corrode and burn the Skin off, if guilty.</P>
<P>Thus is Adultery, Thievery, and Lying try'd.</P>
<P>The fore&s;aid Water of Cur&s;ing, or rather of Divination, wherewith they ex|tort the Truth in all doubtful matters, as we have related, is thus prepared. The <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes the thick Rind of the great Tree <HI>Nelle,</HI> and the Rind of <HI>Quo|ny,</HI> growing al&s;o upon a great Tree bearing Seed, u&s;ed in the making of Poy|&s;on for their Arrows; and mixed with water, as we &s;aid, is given to them to drink who are accu&s;ed of <HI>Sovach.</HI> Thirdly, He takes &s;ome leaves of the <HI>Borrow</HI>-Tree, from which beaten and pre&s;&s;ed proceeds a white Juyce, which with &s;ome mitigating Ingredients makes an excellent Purge, but the &s;tronge&s;t taken alone is mortal Poy&s;on. Moreover, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> adds to the before-recited long Pepper, and a piece of <HI>Mannoone</HI> about the bigne&s;s of a Bean. All the&s;e are put into a little Pot or Horn, and filled up with the Urine of a young man that had never known a woman. This done, they &s;crape in a little <HI>Bonda,</HI> that is, red Dying-weed. La&s;tly, daubing the four &s;ides of the Pot with <HI>Mannoone</HI> chawed in the mouth, it is ready to be &s;et on the fire, which mu&s;t be made un|der the open Heaven in the morning at Sun-ri&s;e, or in the evening at Sun-&s;et, of green Wood. As &s;oon as the water begins to boil, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes a piece of <HI>Domboo,</HI> being a Tree that bears fruit like a Medlar, and puts it under the Seeth|ing Pot; in the mean time trying whether the Ingredients have boyl'd enough, and repeating &s;ecretly the names of the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or of other matters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this Sorcery-water is u&s;ed.</NOTE> to which the Witchcraft mu&s;t be applied. When all is ready, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes the arms or legs of the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and wa&s;heth them clean with fair water. At length he puts his Divining-Staff, which is brui&s;ed and tufted at the end, into the Pot, and drops or pre&s;&s;eth the water out of it upon the arm or leg of the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, muttering the&s;e words over it: <HI>Is he guilty of this, or hath he done this or that;</HI> if yea, <HI>then let it &s;cald or burn him, till the very skin come off.</HI> Now if the per&s;on remain unhurt they hold him innocent, and proceed to the trial of another, till the guilty be di&s;covered; and this is done &s;o long, till the name of the guilty, or the per&s;on be found out.</P>
<P>The Criminal thus found, is without any long procra&s;tinating put to death. The manner of which, according to the variety of Places is different; but the mo&s;t u&s;ual thus: The Executioner takes the Offender, and leads him with his Hands tied behind, and his Eyes blind-folded, either into an open Field or a Wood; whither being come, the Offender upon his Knees, his Head bowed down, he fir&s;t runs through the Body with an A&s;&s;agay, or Simi|ter,
<PB N="406" REF="257">and afterwards chops off his Head with an Axe: for they do not believe he is dead till his Head be cut off. The Carca&s;e cut into four quarters, after great lamentations, they leave in the Field as a Prey to the Bea&s;ts and Fowl, but the Friends take away the Head as a great Pre&s;ent, and boiling it in a Kettle, drink up the Broth, but hang the Scull by their <HI>Feti&s;&s;o,</HI> or Idol.</P>
<P>The like Trial is al&s;o made of other Offences among the <HI>Blacks</HI> in <HI>Quoia;</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>Gala, Hondo, Bolm, Cilm,</HI> and many other Places: &s;o that every one had need to be circum&s;pect and careful to prevent &s;u&s;picion, e&s;pecially the Women, who are for every trifling Caprichio of their Husbands, brought in que&s;tion of their Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>Now if one of the King's Women la&s;h out,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Puni&s;hment of chief Women for Adultery.</NOTE> or go abroad after other Men, and the King be enraged again&s;t it, then he cau&s;eth them to be &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, that if they touch any Ma&s;culine per&s;on, &s;mall or great, they &s;uddenly fall into a kind of Epileptick Fit; according to which three Wives of the pre&s;ent King <HI>Flamboere</HI> &s;uffered: one of which receiving her Daughters Child, not knowing it was a Boy, fell into a Swoon, and might therein have died, if the other Women had not run to the King, and be&s;eeched him that the <HI>Bollimo</HI> might relea&s;e her from the Cur&s;e. But becau&s;e this is an extraordinary thing, no other but the King him&s;elf may put it in execution, and that very &s;eldom.</P>

<P>On this Quarter the Ca&s;tle was very weak while the <HI>Portugals</HI> held it, be|ing without Brea&s;t-works, and &s;carce Fenced with a Mud-Wall: onely there

<P>This Trench without doubt, co&s;t the <HI>Portugals</HI> a very tedious and heavy labour.</P>

<P>The conveniencies for Merchandi&s;e, Provi&s;ion of Food, nece&s;&s;ary Ammu|nition for Wars, and other Commodities, are in great abundance within this Fort; for that the Ships coming out of the Countrey, readily unload, and go back again; there being a Key for Landing or Shipping of all &s;orts of Com|modities at a Water-Gate made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;uffer'd great prejudice &s;o long as the <HI>Portugal's</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd this Fort, becau&s;e they endeavour'd by all means to hinder their Trade with the <HI>Blacks;</HI> whereupon they con&s;ulted, and de&s;ign'd to get it from them, yet always were fru&s;trated in their attempts, till the year Sixteen hundred thirty and &s;even; at which time the Ca&s;tle was in a mean condition, by rea&s;on of great di&s;agree|ment among the <HI>Portugal's:</HI> Then the General of <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Angola</HI> being ac|quainted by the <HI>Kabo&s;eroe's</HI> or Chief people of the <HI>Myne,</HI> that the time was to undertake &s;omewhat about it. This Intelligence he communicated by Let|ter to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company, who provided nine Ships well Man'd, Arm'd, and Victual'd, which in the Year Sixteen hun|dred thirty &s;even, the Five and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> under Collonel <HI>Hans Koin,</HI> went forth from <HI>Farnambuck</HI> to the <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t, and &s;oon arriv'd there in &s;afety; whereof he &s;ent notice to General <HI>Yperen,</HI> who re&s;ided in the Town <HI>Moure</HI> two miles lower, by Letter, to this effect: <HI>That he was there, by Command of</HI> Grave Maurice, <HI>and the Council, furni&s;h'd with Souldiers to undertake the Enter|pri&s;e. He de&s;ir'd therefore to know where was a fit place to Land upon the Ene|mies Quarters, and to advi&s;e with him in what manner the Enterpri&s;e might be pru|dently accompli&s;h'd: That he would endeavour to win the</HI> Blacks <HI>with all po&s;&s;ible Per&s;wa&s;ions, great Promi&s;es, and Rewards, to a&s;si&s;t the Company; and withal, would watch the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>who lay upon the Road, and labour to prevent all other Impe|diments; That they mu&s;t keep all &s;ecret, that the Enterpri&s;e might not be di&s;appointed: and in the interim, he would be upon the Road before</HI> Albine, <HI>or</HI> A&s;&s;ine, <HI>to expect an An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>While thus <HI>Koyn</HI> ply'd upon the Coa&s;t, the <HI>Negroes</HI> come with eigh|teen
<PB N="426" REF="268"><HI>Canoo's</HI> to his Fleet, and ask for <HI>Netherlandi&s;h</HI> Merchandi&s;e, to barter for Elephants-Teeth: But when 'twas an&s;wer'd they had no Wares, the <HI>Blacks</HI> be|gan greatly to doubt; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them friend&s;hip, according to the cu&s;tom of the Countrey, let &s;ome drops of Sea-water fall into their eyes, where|with for the pre&s;ent &s;atisfi'd, they departed.

<P>After much courting, at length, and opening to them their whole de&s;ign, they gat the Youths of <HI>Commendo</HI> with Gifts, and promi&s;es to furni&s;h them with Water and other Provi&s;ion; whereupon on the Four and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they went off to <HI>Cape de Kors,</HI>

Coming about Noon to the fre&s;h River, the Souldiers re&s;ted and refre&s;h'd them&s;elves, &s;ome Scouts were &s;ent for di&s;covery, who brought intelligence, that they di&s;cern'd about a thou&s;and <HI>Blacks</HI> lye at the hanging of a Hill; who having di&s;cover'd, pur&s;u'd them with a great cry; upon this were &s;ent out four Mu&s;quetteers, who venturing too far were lo&s;t, and their heads by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> according to the manner of the Countrey cut off, and carried in triumph. But a greater force falling in, &s;oon put them to flight, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Hill whence the other were driven.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the &s;ix and twentieth, tho&s;e of <HI>Commendo</HI> drew our Mariners to the Town of <HI>Myne,</HI> which they a&s;&s;aulted, and took all their Cattel.</P>
<P>The Commander in Chief bending his whole thoughts to take the Ca&s;tle, caus'd in this interval two Pa&s;&s;ages to be made, by cutting up the Bu&s;hes on the Mountain <HI>St. Jago;</HI> the one leading towards the Shore, by which to bring the Ammunition for the Souldiers; and the other upon the top of the Moun|tain near the Fort. On Thur&s;day were brought two Pieces of Ordnance with a Mortar-Piece to <HI>Mount St. Jago,</HI> with which they made eight or ten Shot, be&s;ides as many Granadoes, but they fell &s;hort; whereas by the &s;hooting of the Enemy from the Ca&s;tle, two Centinels were kill'd. Then the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Commendo</HI> approached towards the Town of <HI>Myne;</HI> but driven back by the Enemies great Shot,

<P>The <HI>Akani&s;ts</HI> have Commerce with the Inhabitants of <HI>Soko,</HI> and bring from thence Clothes, which they Exchange for Ryals of Eight, or other Pieces of Silver; but this very &s;eldom, by rea&s;on of the great danger of the Ways, as we mention'd but lately: however &s;uch as do venture, and make a &s;afe Journey, gain great Riches by the aforemention'd Clothes.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sama</HI> the <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory, and Trade with the People of <HI>Adom</HI> and <HI>Wa&s;&s;a</HI> for the &s;ame Wares that were wont to be Vented at <HI>Ante, viz.</HI> Iron, Says, Cour&s;e Linnen, Seamens Knives, Beads, old Sheets, and &s;uch like.</P>

<P><HI>Cabo Cors</HI> for &s;ome years had repute for the chiefe&s;t Place of Trade on the <HI>Gold-Coa&s;t,</HI> but of late &s;o decay'd, that &s;carce any &s;hew of it remains: yet &s;till the Merchants keep a Store-hou&s;e there to furni&s;h the Inhabitants, and tho&s;e that come daily from <HI>Fetu</HI> thither to Market.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Blacks,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Blacks</HI> are cunning in fal&s;ifying their Gold.</NOTE> as they have good Judgment, and can quickly &s;ee if the Gold be good or not, &s;o they know by a peculiar Art, to fal&s;ifie and emba&s;e that which they intend to give to the <HI>Whites,</HI> in divers manners.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of their Cheats they practice in their Gilded Arm-Rings, which they mix with Copper, as likewi&s;e among other pieces of Gold, and cannot be di|&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Gold, when newly Clipt, but grow commonly Ru&s;ty and Pale, having lay'n &s;ome time among&s;t the Gold: the be&s;t proof they make by Strong-Waters.</P>
<P>Their melted Gold (which Art of Melting they have learn'd from the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>) they fal&s;ifie with two much red Copper, or Silver mixt among&s;t it; for without one of the&s;e two the Gold will not Run. This is a Cheat very common and u&s;ual among tho&s;e of <HI>Fantyn.</HI></P>
<P>They have yet another Trick, to cover Silver and red Copper over with Gold, &s;o as not to be di&s;cover'd unle&s;s you cut it.</P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> us'd to puni&s;h the <HI>Blacks</HI> very &s;everely, if they brought but one Peny-weight of fal&s;ifi'd Gold to &s;ell, without any re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Gold as it comes out of the Myne, without Melting or Refining, is ta|ken for the be&s;t, that is, when the Sand, or Du&s;t is meerly Sifted out: Be&s;ides, one Myne affords much better Gold than another; for the deeper they fetch up the Gold, the wor&s;e it proves, being &s;poil'd by too much Quick-Silver.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Gold brought from the upper Places of this Coa&s;t, that of <HI>Atzyn</HI> and <HI>Adom</HI> bears the Credit as the be&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis ob&s;erv'd, that the Peo|ple Melt it without fal&s;ifying.</P>
<P>The <HI>Akani&s;ts</HI> bring mo&s;t melted Gold, which is taken for good; but they mu&s;t be narrowly in&s;pected, for they are ingenious at Gilding.</P>

The Grandees wear a Garland of Elephants, or Sea-Hor&s;es Teeth: About their Bodies they have a Leathern Girdle, that comes betwixt their Legs, with a &s;mall Cloth before their Privacies; and in the Gir|dle they &s;tick a Knife, or Ponyard, who&s;e Sheaths are made of Dogs, or Buck-Skins, adorn'd with a great red Shell of a Hand breadth on the top.

<P>Their other Arms are Darts, Shields, <HI>A&s;&s;agays,</HI> or Lances, and two-edged Swords, with Handles of the Bones of Lions, Tygers, and other dangerous Bea&s;ts, Knobb'd at the ends, and cover'd with a Plate of Gold, or with Skins of Fi&s;h.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their con&s;titution.</NOTE> for per&s;ons of Ability wear two, three, or four Garments, one &s;horter than another, &s;o pink'd, that the undermo&s;t appeareth through the upper; but the Common People have &s;carce one to cover their naked Bodies.</P>
<P>The Women have a blue Cloth from the middle, reaching below the Knee,

<P>No man may go Clothed to, or in the Court, unle&s;s the King appoint him his Habit; in&s;omuch that there are Men in the Palace of twenty, or twenty four years of Age, who go &s;tark naked, without any &s;ign of &s;hame, onely with a Chain of fine Coral or Ja&s;per about their Necks. But when the King gives them Garments, and together with them a Wife, ever after they always go Cloathed, and wa&s;h their Hair, which never grows to &s;uch length as to need cutting. Neither may the Women put on any Cloathes, till given by her Husband; &s;o that Women of twenty, and five and twenty years old run along the Streets &s;tark naked without &s;hame or rebuke: but when the Husband hath once Suited her, he cau&s;es a Hou&s;e to be made for her, and &s;leeps by her, as by his other Wives.</P>
<P>Every Man Marries as many Women as he de&s;ires,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> yet keeps be&s;ides a great number of Concubines: But a <HI>White</HI> or a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> may not be permitted to keep a Girl, becau&s;e forbidden on pain of Death.</P>
<P>The Woman that hath had a Son by her decea&s;ed Husband,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Widow is a Woman-Servant to her Son.</NOTE> may not Mar|ry again, but mu&s;t be a Slave to her Son. Now if it happen, that any Man have a mind to &s;uch a Widow, he &s;ues to the Son for her, promi&s;ing to give him another young Maid in her &s;tead, which mu&s;t continue his Slave&s;s as long as he plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If the Parents be&s;tow not their Daughter in Marriage before twelve or fourteen years of Age, after that time they have nothing more to do with her.</P>
<P>All the Women that after the death of the Husband admit another into their private Embraces, fall to the King, whom he be&s;tows in Marriage; but &s;uch as keep them&s;elves more re&s;erv'd, the Son claims, and be&s;tows upon re|que&s;t, as we have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>Sometimes the King doth not be&s;tow the&s;e Women in Marriage again, but makes <HI>Regetairs,</HI> or Nur&s;es of them. The&s;e, con&s;idering they need not &s;tand in fear of a Husband, chu&s;e as many &s;ingle Men as they like, to whom they pro&s;titute them&s;elves at plea&s;ure: and when any of them prove with Child, and bear a Son, they are free from paying of Tribute; but if they have a Girl, it becomes the King's due to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P>There are great <HI>Regetairs,</HI> to whom the inferior give a yearly account, as they again to the great <HI>Fiadores,</HI> or Trea&s;urers of the Empire, who declare the &s;ame to the King onely.</P>
<P>No Man may &s;leep with his Wife when &s;he hath lay'n in Childbed, before the Child is a year and a half old: but &s;he knows well enough how to play her Game in the mean time with others; of which if the Husband get any knowledge, he complains to the <HI>Fiadoors.</HI></P>
<P>There are no Twins found,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why there are no Twins.</NOTE> though likely enough that &s;ome are born; yet conceal'd with all care po&s;&s;ible by the Midwife, becau&s;e they count the bearing of two Children at a Birth, a great &s;hame to a Woman.</P>
<P>They bury their Dead with all their Cloathes,

<P>Concerning Inheritance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance.</NOTE> the Husband takes all the Goods the Wife leaves behind her, except what &s;he hath given her Children, while living; whereas the Woman may not, after the decea&s;e of her Husband, take the lea&s;t part, be|cau&s;e they all, as well Wives, Slaves, as other Goods, fall to the King; who for the mo&s;t part, if there be a Son, be&s;tows them on him.</P>
<P>No Foreigners can Trade up the River of <HI>Benyn</HI> without Order of the King; who chu&s;es one <HI>Fiadoor,</HI>

Such Goods as they have brought of before, continue at the &s;et Price; but new Goods have a Price &s;et upon them: and when they have beat down Commodities as low as they can, and the Market &s;et, they go on to Trade.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Benyn</HI> have for their own u&s;e other Cloathes, made in <HI>Coffo,</HI> a Town lying a days Journey Ea&s;tward from thence; but no <HI>Whites</HI> may come there.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Gotton</HI> and <HI>Benyn</HI> great Plains &s;pread them&s;elves, wherein on Set-Days rich and plentiful Markets are found, extraordinarily crowded by all &s;orts of Dealers.</P>

The Nobility, when they go to the Wars, Cloathe them&s;elves in Scarlet, as a Badge of Eminency; others have Gorgets of Elephants and Leopard-Teeth, and high red Caps, Wrought and Quilted with Leopards and Civet-Cat Skins; unto which hangs a long Hor&s;e Tail for Ornament.</P>
<P>The common Soldiers u&s;ually go with the upper part of their Body naked, but on the lower wear a Cloth as fine as Silk.</P>
<P>In Fighting they keep a good Di&s;cipline and Order, for none may &s;tir from his Place, though he &s;ee Death inevitable before his Eyes. None participate of the Booty but the General, or Field-Martial, by them call'd <HI>Owe-A&s;erry,</HI> or <HI>Sia&s;&s;eere:</HI> and yet every one thanks the King, that he will account them worthy of Employment, and deign to &s;end them to the Wars for him. What Arrows remain after the Battel un&s;hot, they lay up in &s;everal Chambers in the King's Armory, and pre&s;ently make as many new again; which poy&s;on'd by the <HI>Feti|&s;ero's,</HI> become u&s;eful for further Service.</P>

Six of the foremen|tion'd Pieces make a Garment, which they know how to Colour, Red, Black, or Green.</P>
<P>The two other &s;orts of Cloathes are a wearing for Common People, being plain, without Images or Figures, yet have their di&s;tinctions; one being clo&s;er and firmer wrought than the other.

<P>Over their Shoulders they hang a Sack, about three quarters of a yard long, &s;ew'd together, onely a little opening left to put in the hand.</P>
<P>Upon their Head they have an artificial Cap, made to &s;it clo&s;e.</P>
<P>And in their Hands, either a great Knife, Bowe and Arrows, or a Sword; for they never go without Arms.</P>
<P>The Womens Clothes, which come a little below their knees, are made of the &s;ame with the Mens; over which they &s;ometimes put &s;ome fine <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Stuff or Linen, but without any Girdles: The uppermo&s;t part of the bo|dy, and the Head remains always naked and bare, but on their Arms, Legs, and Necks, many Rings, Beads and other Toys.</P>

<P>They Swear by the King, &s;peaking the&s;e words, <HI>Fyga Manilovanga;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oath, or Swearing.</NOTE> but the highe&s;t Oath is, the Drinking of <HI>Bondes Root;</HI> and never u&s;ed, but when &s;ome|thing is pre&s;ently to be undertaken or perform'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bondes</HI> is onely a Root of a Tree, of a ru&s;&s;et Colour, very Bitter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bondes</HI> Root, or Adjura|tion Root.</NOTE> and a&s;tringent; and gets (as they &s;ay) by enchantment of the <HI>Ganga,</HI> or Conjurer, perfect power and vertue. This Root they &s;crape with a Knife, and put into a Pot of Water, of which the accu&s;ed Party takes about a Pint and half, admi|ni&s;tred by a per&s;on appointed by the King for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By this <HI>Bonde</HI>-Drink al&s;o, they find out the cau&s;e of any Ca&s;ualty or Mi&s;|hap, and how it chances; for they believe that none can die, but he mu&s;t be brought to his end, either by him&s;elf, or another: So when any falls into the Water, and is drown'd, they will not con&s;ider the accident, but &s;tifly maintain he was bewitch'd; and that &s;ome enemy hath by his <HI>Moqui&s;ies,</HI> or Sorceries brought it upon him. If any in a Wood, or by the Way, be kill'd by a Tyger or Wolf, they firmly believe and &s;ay, that the Tyger was a <HI>Dakkin,</HI> that is, a Sorcerer or Witch, who had by the <HI>Moqui&s;ies</HI> or Idols, chang'd them&s;elves into &s;uch a bea&s;t; and he that &s;hould go about to per&s;wade them to think other|wi&s;e, they would laugh him to &s;corn, and hold him for a fool; &s;o if any mans hou&s;e or goods happen to be burn'd, they &s;ay, that one or other of the <HI>Moqui|&s;ies</HI> hath &s;et it on fire; or if at any time they have a more than u&s;ual drowth,

<P>In like manner, if any weighty or criminal matter, either of Sorcery or Theft be laid to any ones charge, and it cannot be a&s;certain'd by the Oracle of <HI>Ganga</HI> or their Conjurer; they forthwith condemn the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on to drink of the <HI>Bonde</HI>-drink, which is perform'd in this manner;</P>
<P>The Complainant mu&s;t go to the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Bonde</HI>-drink is drank.</NOTE> and be&s;eech him to appoint an ad|mini&s;trator of the <HI>Bondes;</HI> for which he pays the King his due. The&s;e <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers are about eight or ten per&s;ons, appointed by the King and his Nobility; who meeting under the open Heaven, in a broad way, &s;it down upon the ground, and about three a Clock in the afternoon, begin their work, for by that, the Complainers mu&s;t be there; who coming with their whole Retinue and Generation, the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers, admoni&s;h to bring to light the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the Matter, without any &s;iding or partiality; which he adjures them to with an Oath by their <HI>Feti&s;ies,</HI> which they have &s;tanding round about them. Then al&s;o appears the Accus'd, with his Family; for &s;eldom one per&s;on alone, but commonly, the whole Neighbourhood is accus'd; the&s;e meet, and &s;tanding in a row, come by cour&s;e one by one to the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers, (who have a little Drum, upon which they continually Beat,) and receiving about a Pint and a half of Liquor, they retire to their places again.</P>
<P>After this, one of the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers ri&s;eth up, with certain &s;ticks of a <HI>Bacoven</HI> tree in his hands, which he flings after the Accus'd, requiring him to fall down; and if he have no guilt, to &s;tand up and make Water, in token of his Innocency. Then the <HI>Bonde</HI>-giver cuts the Root before them all, that every one may walk up and down over it. In the doing whereof, if one or other of them chance to fall, then the &s;tanders by &s;et up a loud Cry, and the party fall'n, lieth like a po&s;&s;e&s;s'd man, &s;peechle&s;s, but with horrible Convul&s;ions in all his Limbs, not enduring his body to be touch'd; and this they hold for a
<PB N="499" REF="315">certain &s;ign, that &s;uch a Per&s;on is guilty of what he was charged withall. But tho&s;e which Urine, receive acclamations of joy and prai&s;e, and both Strangers and his Friends conduct him to his Dwelling, declaring his innocency to every one they meet. On the other hand, if it be a matter criminal, that the que&s;tion'd Per&s;on &s;tands thus convict, or that he hath many ill-willers, they pre&s;ently carry him about a quarter of an hours Journey from the place of Trial to a broad Way, and there cut him in pieces: but if it be but &s;ome Peccadillio, or they have a mind to &s;pare the accu&s;ed, then with Man's Or|dure, mingled with Water and &s;ome green Herbs pour'd into his Mouth (which is the onely Antidote) they &s;eek to expell the Poy&s;on.</P>
<P>Some when they are accu&s;ed have permi&s;&s;ion for their Slaves to drink in their &s;tead; but if he falls a&s;leep, the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf mu&s;t take it, and in his &s;leep the Antidote is given. If the Ma&s;ter fall, and it be a great Crime, he mu&s;t die; but a &s;mall matter, he buys off the offence with &s;ome Slaves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers oftentimes u&s;e great jugling and impo&s;ture; for though a Per&s;on have no guilt, yet he will by his Sorcery make him fall, if either the People hate him, or the Accu&s;ers be great.</P>
<P>Many al&s;o, who&s;e guilt their evil living &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates, &s;o corrupt by Bribes and Gifts, that they &s;eem innocent; but by this means it goes very hard with the Poor, who generally &s;uffer, while it may be the guilty &s;it by laughing at their inferiors; &s;o true is that of the old Poet,

<P>La&s;tly, the Accu&s;ers bring the Convict naked (for the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Bondes</HI> takes his Cap and his Cloathes as his Vails) before the King's Court, where he receives &s;entence of death, to be hew'd in pieces, as we related before.</P>
<P>They u&s;e no peculiar Ceremonies in Marriage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> nor &s;carce trouble them&s;elves for con&s;ent of Friends: &s;ome chu&s;e Children of &s;ix, &s;even, or eight years of Age, who when they arrive to ten, they take home and bring up in private: If afterwards any behave them&s;elves impudently, the Husband may without any Man's gain&s;aying puni&s;h her.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Parents will not let their Daughters Marry, till arrived to per|fect Womanhood; and then whoever de&s;ires to Match with her, he goes to her Friends, and buys her of them at a certain Price.</P>
<P>If it happen (as it doth very often) that a Maid be enticed to leudene&s;s be|fore Marriage, they mu&s;t both appear in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome hundreds of Men before the King at his Court, and declaring their fault, the King gives pardon.</P>
<P>And this they judge &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that many a&s;&s;uredly believe, if they had not obtain'd ab&s;olution from the King in manner beforemention'd, that the whole Countrey would peri&s;h with drowth, and it would not Rain; where|as yet the like bu&s;ine&s;s is perform'd by others that have no &s;uch belief, with|out acquainting the King.</P>
<P>The Child follows the Mother, and is a Slave if &s;he be &s;o, though the Father be a Free-man; but if the Mother be free, and the Father a Slave, yet the Child is free.</P>
<P>Every Noble-man may have as many Wives as he hath ability to Cloathe, and can procure Fi&s;h and Wine for their moderate Maintenance; &s;o that
<PB N="500" REF="316">&s;ome have ten or twelve; but every ordinary per&s;on hath commonly two or three.</P>
<P>The Women do all the &s;ervile works, for they break the Ground, Sowe and Reap, pluck up the <HI>Mille,</HI> beat it into Meal, boyl it, and give it to their Hus|bands to eat, who take care for nothing but Drink. When the Husband eats, the Wife &s;its afar off, and takes the leavings; and withall &s;o &s;lavi&s;hly &s;ubject to their Husbands, that they dare not &s;peak to them but upon their bare Knees, and in meeting them, as a demon&s;tration of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t creep upon their Hands.</P>
<P>They colour their whole Bodies with <HI>Takoel</HI>-Wood ground upon Stones, and &s;o made a fit Painting.</P>
<P>If it happen, that one enjoys another Man's Wife, they fall into great con|tention about it, untill &s;atisfaction be given to the injur'd Party, and agree|ment made, to which of them &s;he &s;hall belong: Nor doth this Quarrel bound it &s;elf within the Families of the&s;e, but all the Neighbors of the Place, where the injur'd Per&s;on dwells, think them&s;elves oblig'd to help him; as on the other hand, the Offender's Neighbors help him, yet &s;till with this caution, that they &s;pare no endeavor to make peace: However this rai&s;es jealou&s;ies among them, which &s;ometimes ri&s;e to that heighth, as to end in blood.</P>
<P>When any die,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">nerals for the Dead.</NOTE> they make great &s;hew of &s;orrow, lamenting and howling in the Way, like People di&s;tracted; then the Friends bring out the Corps in|to the Street, to wa&s;h and make clean, continuing their barbarous lamenta|tions, and interrogating, <HI>Why he dy'd?</HI> and, <HI>Whether he wanted Meat and Drink?</HI> with other like idle Fancies; in which madne&s;s they keep up two or three hours. In the mean time his neare&s;t Relations bring &s;everal of their Goods to ca&s;t by the Corps in the Grave, as al&s;o all his own, and then &s;natching it up, run away therewith, as if they had &s;toll'n it.

<P>The Dead lieth in the mid&s;t, or &s;its &s;ometimes upon a Mat, or Block, &s;up|ported and propp'd up with Wood to keep him from falling. They pare his Nails, &s;have off his Hair, anoint his Body with <HI>Takoel</HI>-Wood; and in the mean while the Women run about and relate his Life and Speeches by rule and or|der, &s;etting forth al&s;o the greatne&s;s of his Linage and Family, with what State and Grandeur he maintain'd him&s;elf and Retinue, whom he accounted his Friends, and whom his Enemies. This Relation of his Enemies immedi|ately rai&s;ing jealou&s;ies in the heads of his &s;urviving Friends, they begin to en|quire into the cau&s;e of his Death; whereof not able to obtain any certainty, they re&s;olve to go to the <HI>Moqui&s;ies</HI> for advice. While this continues in debate, every one brings and gives to the next Friends, or tho&s;e whom his Death mo&s;t concerns, &s;ome Cloathes or Garments, wherewith to defray the Expences, which they &s;hall be at in &s;earching out the cau&s;e of the Decea&s;ed's Death. This having continued two, three, or more days and nights, with &s;ome re|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="501" REF="316">of Laments; at la&s;t they run away with the Corps, and bury it either in the Fields, or by <HI>Chienga,</HI> where divers Wizards call'd <HI>Kokokoo,</HI> dwell, throw|ing part of his Goods into the Grave, and part over it, as we have it, and par|ticularly one of his <HI>Moqui&s;ies,</HI> that is, a Pot, a Wooden Shovel, an Arrow, <HI>Kalbas,</HI> a Cup to drink in, Tobacco, a Pipe, a Staff, Lances, or &s;uch like.

<P>Now if the neare&s;t to the Decea&s;ed will &s;hew his duty, in &s;earching after the cau&s;e of his Death, he falls upon the inquiry; for which they u&s;e &s;everal ways, but the following is the mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>They go to the <HI>Conga,</HI> or Wizard, &s;itting upon the Ground behind a Hou&s;e,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the cau&s;e of any Man's death is &s;earched after.</NOTE> and lay a great Knife down before him, which he oftentimes touches, and then rubs his hands one upon another; whereupon they &s;peak to him in the&s;e words: <HI>Such a one is decea&s;ed, or dead, we have buried him, is he brought to his end by Witchcraft? or have his</HI> Moqui&s;ies <HI>kill'd him?</HI> If upon this enquiring the Hands be|gin to &s;trike hard one upon another without any more rubbing, they take it for granted his <HI>Moqui&s;ies</HI> kill'd him. Again, if the hands in rubbing happen to &s;trike one another, and he brings them right again with clapping, then they be|gin once more, and ask again, <HI>Such a one is dead, and brought to his end by</HI> Moqui&s;ies, <HI>or Witchcraft, where dwells he? who hath done it? here or yonder, or is he of his acquain|tance?</HI> &amp;c. till they know more; or if they &s;uppo&s;e more had a hand in it than one, they ask, <HI>Whether Man or Woman did it, by what</HI> Moqui&s;ies <HI>he was bewitched, and what cau&s;e they had for it,</HI> and the like. Sometimes they run two or three Moneths from one Town to another, and from one <HI>Ganga</HI> to another, and leave no <HI>Moqui&s;ies</HI> almo&s;t unasked, till at length they &s;uppo&s;e how it was done, or in what Town he dwells, or under whom he lives: If they dare not name or di&s;cover the Per&s;on, they take the whole Town, that they may find out the Guilty therein; and applying them&s;elves for that end to one of the King's No|bility, enquire whether there be a <HI>Bony,</HI> that is, a Hamlet where they &s;uppo&s;e the &s;u&s;pected Party to be, that he may drink <HI>Bondes,</HI> who gives them leave: Then he goes to the chiefe&s;t of the <HI>Bondes,</HI> call'd <HI>Konda,</HI> and &s;eeks for &s;ome to make ready the <HI>Bonde</HI>-Drink, and to admini&s;ter it.</P>
<P>In the Morning when they intend to begin, they come to the <HI>Boany,</HI> or Hamlet, together, &s;etting them&s;elves down in the mid&s;t of the Village, in an open place upon the Market, if there be one: and then the <HI>Bondes</HI> takes out of every Hamlet a Man, who drinks for the whole. Now if one of the&s;e fall, that Hamlet, for which he drank, mu&s;t all hand the Cup one to another, be|cau&s;e they believe the guilty Per&s;on hides him&s;elf therein.</P>
<P>If all the Men e&s;cape, then comes the lot to the Women, who drink not them&s;elves, but others in their Names; and if there &s;hall fall one, or more, the Women for whom they drank are taken for guilty, and as Sorcere&s;&s;es are put to death. But of this we have &s;aid more than enough.</P>
<P>The Children inherit not after the Father's Decea&s;e, but the elde&s;t Brother,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Inheritance.</NOTE> or Si&s;ter; and he or &s;he is nece&s;&s;itated to bring up the Children, till they can live of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There are many Handicrafts among them, as Weavers, Smiths, Cap-makers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employments.</NOTE> Potters, Bead-makers, Carpenters, Vintners, or Tap&s;ters, Fi&s;her-men, <HI>Canoo</HI>-makers, Merchants, and other Traders. They make a kind of Hemp, taken out from the peel'd Leaves of the <HI>Matombe</HI>-Trees, about three quarters of a Yard &s;quare. This Hemp is of two &s;orts, the one call'd <HI>Poe&s;ana,</HI> fit onely for
<PB N="502" REF="317">cour&s;e Cloathes; and the other <HI>Poe&s;ampama,</HI> whereof they Weave finer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> buy tho&s;e Clothes in great abundance, and carry them to <HI>Lovango Saint Paulo,</HI> where they are deliver'd in &s;tead of Money; for in that place they are the &s;tandard to value all Commodities by. Every Cloth, call'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e Panos Sambes;</HI> and in Countrey phra&s;e, <HI>Mollole-Vierry,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of four pieces &s;titch'd together, call'd <HI>Libonges;</HI> &s;eventeen &s;uch are valu'd at for one piece of Slezy Ticking; and every pound of Ivory, bears the price of five <HI>Libonges.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner the Inhabitants of <HI>Lovango,</HI>

<P>Mo&s;t of the riches of the Inhabitants con&s;i&s;ts in Slaves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> for what other wealth they have, is lavi&s;h't out profu&s;ely in idle expences.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes brought out of this Countrey by the <HI>Whites,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> are Elephants Teeth, Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, and other things; but are gotten with great labour, by the Inhabitants, becau&s;e of the far lying off of the Mines.</P>
<P>From a certain place call'd <HI>Sondy,</HI> not far from <HI>Aby&s;ine,</HI> or the Empire of <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> mo&s;t of the Copper is brought thither.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>September</HI> there flock to <HI>Sondy,</HI> many Smiths from &s;everal Coun|treys to melt Copper; who continue there till <HI>May,</HI> and then depart, becau&s;e of the approaching dry time. But by the unskilfulne&s;s of the Inhabitants, this Copper is much debas'd, who melt all Mettals one among another; to pre|vent which, &s;ome have been &s;ent where the Mines are, to teach them to di&s;tin|gui&s;h and &s;eparate the Mettals; but they would never permit them to do any thing, or be drawn to alter their own vicious method.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whites</HI> bring al&s;o out of this Countrey Elephants-Tails, which the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> buy and carry to <HI>Lovango Saint Paulo,</HI> where they prove very good and ready Merchandize; that is, an hundred Hairs put together, they value at a thou&s;and <HI>Rees.</HI> This Hair the <HI>Blacks</HI> braid very finely, and wear about their Necks; but the greate&s;t and longe&s;t Hairs braided, they wear about the Wa&s;te; of which, fifty Hairs are &s;old for a thou&s;and <HI>Rees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lovango,</HI> u&s;eth to vent yearly great abundance of Ivory; but every year the quantity decrea&s;es, becau&s;e the <HI>Blacks</HI> fetch it &s;o far out of the Countrey, and carry it upon their Heads. The chiefe&s;t place where the Staple for this Com|modity remains, is call'd <HI>Backkamele,</HI> about three hundred miles up into the Countrey, &s;o that the <HI>Blacks</HI> have near three moneths labour, before they can fini&s;h their journey forwards and backwards.</P>
<P>The Merchandize brought by tho&s;e of <HI>Lovango,</HI> are Salt, Oyl of Palm, broad Knives, made by them&s;elves, cour&s;e Sle&s;ie Tickings, black Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, Cu&s;hion Leaves, and &s;ome other Trifles, be&s;ides Slaves and Elephants-Teeth: In the former of which, they make u&s;e of the&s;e Slaves to carry their goods from place to place, to &s;ave other extraordinary charge of carriage.</P>
<P>The Roads from <HI>Lovango</HI> to <HI>Pombo, Sondy, Mon&s;el, Great Mokoko,</HI> and other places, are much infe&s;ted by the <HI>Jages;</HI> &s;o that it is dangerous for Merchants to travel that way; though they u&s;ually go in whole Troops under a chief Commander that is very faithful to them.</P>
<P>But for the obtaining of free Trade in <HI>Lovango,</HI> the <HI>Whites</HI> mu&s;t continually give pre&s;ents to the King, and his Mother the Queen, and two Noblemen, ap|pointed Over&s;eers of the Factory, call'd <HI>Manikes,</HI> and <HI>Manikinga,</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>

<P>The third, <HI>Mani-Beloor,</HI> is chief Superintendent over <HI>Chilongo;</HI> and be&s;ides that Charge, hath the Office of Searcher over the <HI>Dockies</HI> or Sorcerers, and takes care of &s;uch as fall under the <HI>Bondes.</HI></P>
<P>The great Province of <HI>Chilongatiamokango,</HI> as free Lord he rules without ac|knowledging any &s;ubjection to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Mani-Kinga,</HI> is Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Piri;</HI> and <HI>Mani-Matta,</HI> Captain of the Guard; for <HI>Matta</HI> &s;ignifies a Bowe, and <HI>Mani</HI> a Prince.</P>
<P>The King, for the better managing of his weighty affairs, hath &s;everal other inferior Officers; as <HI>Manidonga,</HI> Governor of <HI>Pattovey</HI> to Guard the King's Wives; two <HI>Manaenders,</HI> that is, Butlers to the King in the day, and two other for the night: <HI>Moeton Ambamma,</HI> &s;ervant of the great Captain <HI>Bamma;</HI> with a multitude of others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e, the great Butler bears no &s;mall &s;way; his title, <HI>Ma|bonde-Lovango,</HI> that is, <HI>Upper Butler of Lovango,</HI> for he takes care of all Vyands, and hath four other under him; whereof (as we &s;aid) two in the day time, when the King is in the Wine-Hou&s;e; and two in the evening perform their &s;ervice: and la&s;tly, every divi&s;ion of the Countrey hath a particular Nobleman appointed by the King; as we in Hundreds have Ju&s;tices of the Peace.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Lovango</HI> hath the repute of a potent Lord,

<P>If any be found Guilty, who&s;e mi&s;erable poverty affords no means of &s;ati&s;|faction, then may the offended &s;eek remedy, every man of the Tribe or Ge|neration whereof he was, and make them work for him, till he receive the full recompence of his lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The King hath (by the report of the <HI>Blacks</HI>) near &s;even thou&s;and Wives;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King hath many Wives.</NOTE> for after the decea&s;e of one King, his Succe&s;&s;or keeps all his Wives, and brings al|&s;o many be&s;ides to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wives are kept in no great re&s;pect; for they mu&s;t work no le&s;s than other women: Some few of them he &s;elects for his Amours, and with them
<PB N="504" REF="318">&s;pends much time; the other he &s;huts up as Nunns in Cloy&s;ters.</P>
<P>When one of the&s;e proves with Child, one mu&s;t drink <HI>Bonde</HI> for her, to know whether this Woman hath had to do with any other be&s;ides the King. Now if the Man who hath &s;o drank be well, they judge the Woman upright; but if the Man falls, &s;he is condemn'd and burnt, and the Adulterer buried alive.</P>
<P>The King as &s;upream Governor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mother is appropria|ted for the King.</NOTE> appropriates to him&s;elf one to be as a Mo|ther, a grave Matron, and of good and try'd experience, which they call <HI>Ma|konda;</HI> whom he reverences with more honour than his own natural Mother. This <HI>Makonda</HI> hath a great prerogative and priviledge, to do good offices both to the Nobility and common People, that fall into the di&s;-favour of the King; who is nece&s;&s;itated in all weighty affairs to u&s;e her Coun&s;el: for &s;he hath &s;uch authority,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Authority.</NOTE> that if the King provokes her any way, and doth not grant her Suit &s;peedily, &s;he may take away his life.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;he takes the advantage (without any daring to controll her) to &s;a|tiate her unruly appetite, as often, and with whom &s;he plea&s;es; and what|ever Children &s;he hath by &s;uch means, bears all the &s;ame repute that proceeds of the Royal Race: but if her Gallants meddle with other Women, they are by authority of the Law, puni&s;hed with Death; &s;o that the&s;e accounted felici|ties carry with them their infortune: and if they imagine them&s;elves detected, they have no way to pre&s;erve their Lives but by flight.</P>
<P>When the King dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance of the Crown.</NOTE> his Children &s;ucceed not, but the Crown devolves to his elde&s;t Brother; and for want of Brothers, to his Si&s;ters Children.</P>
<P>Such as may pretend any right to the Crown, have their Dwellings in &s;eve|ral Cities and Towns; and as they come nearer to the Government, the nigher they draw towards <HI>Lovango:</HI> now &s;o &s;oon as the King dies, the Lord which dwelleth in the next Town of all, cometh to the Dominion, and he that dwelleth neare&s;t to him, &s;upplieth his place again, and &s;o on to the la&s;t, with this Provi&s;o, that they mu&s;t be of Noble Blood by the Mothers &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Mani-Kay,</HI> the fir&s;t Succe&s;&s;or to the Throne, dwelleth in a great City, call'd <HI>Kay,</HI> about a mile and a half, North North-We&s;t from <HI>Lovango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Bocke,</HI> the &s;econd, dwelleth in a Town four or five miles up into the Countrey, call'd <HI>Bocke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Cellage,</HI> the third, re&s;ides in a pretty large Town, by Name <HI>Cellage,</HI> ten or twelve miles Northward of <HI>Lovango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Katt,</HI> the fourth, remains in the Village, about fifteen miles from <HI>Lo|vango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Injami,</HI> the fifth, holds his Seat in a Hamlet call'd <HI>Injami,</HI> Southwards towards <HI>Calongo.</HI></P>
<P>After the Decea&s;e of the old King, <HI>Mani-Kay</HI> &s;ucceeded, and <HI>Mani-Bocke</HI> came again in his place, and every one follows his Lot.</P>
<P>The King's younge&s;t Brother hath his Man&s;ion in <HI>Chila&s;ia,</HI> and from thence comes to <HI>Bocke</HI> upon the fir&s;t Vacancy; and if he hath a Child by his Wife, and have offer'd Sacrifice to their <HI>Cares,</HI> or bani&s;h'd Gods, removes to <HI>Kay,</HI> the next place to the Royal Seat.</P>
<P>After the decea&s;e of the <HI>Mani-Kay,</HI> immediately enters upon the Government, yet comes not pre&s;ently into the Court, but continues near &s;ix Moneths in his own City, till all Ceremonies of the Burial be perform'd.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Mani</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Lord</HI> or <HI>Prince,</HI> and is the greate&s;t Title of Honour or Expre&s;&s;ion which they give one among another; the King him&s;elf hath the

<P>The King and his Brothers are commonly jealous one of another; for if any one of them happen to be &s;ick, they pre&s;ently &s;u&s;pect State-policy.</P>
<P>The King commonly wears Cloth or Stuff, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Cloathing.</NOTE> or other <HI>Whites,</HI> bring to them. The King and great Noble-men have on their left Arm the Skin of a wild Cat &s;ew'd together, with one end &s;tuffed round and &s;tiff.</P>
<P>The King hath peculiar Orders and Cu&s;toms in Eating and Drinking;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cu&s;toms of the King's in Eating and Drinking.</NOTE> for which he keeps two &s;everal Hou&s;es, one to eat in, and the other to drink in; and although he hath many Hou&s;es, yet by vertue of this Cu&s;tom he may u&s;e no other. He makes two Meals a day, the fir&s;t in the Morning, about ten a Clock; where his Meat is brought in cover'd Baskets, near which a Man goes with a great Bell, to give notice to every one of the coming of the Kings Di&s;hes: whereupon the King, &s;o &s;oon as he is acquainted with it, leaves the Company he is withall, and goes thither. But the Servitors go all away, becau&s;e none,

How &s;trictly they ob&s;erve this Cu&s;tom, appears by the en&s;uing relation.</P>
<P>A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> of <HI>Lovango,</HI> named <HI>St. Paulo,</HI> lying in <HI>Angola</HI> to Trade, had pre|&s;ented the King with a brave Dog, which for his faithfulne&s;s he loved very much: This Dog, not &s;o &s;trictly look'd to by his Keeper, while the King was eating, ran &s;melling and &s;eeking after his Ma&s;ter, whom he mi&s;&s;ed, and came at length, without any body's minding him, to the Door, which with his No&s;e he thru&s;t open, and went to the King whom he &s;aw eating: but the King cau&s;ed his Servants in&s;tantly with a Rope to put the Dog to death; for be it Man or Child, Mou&s;e, Cat or Dog, or any other living Creature that hath &s;een the King eat, if it can be gotten, it e&s;capes not death.</P>
<P>It happened, that a Noble-man's Child, about &s;even or eight years old, who was with his Father in the King's Banquetting-hou&s;e, fell a&s;leep, and when the King was drinking, awaked; whereupon it was in&s;tantly &s;entenc'd to die, with a reprieve only for &s;ix or &s;even days at the Fathers reque&s;t; that time elap|&s;ed, the Child was &s;truck upon the No&s;e with a Smiths Hammer, and the blood dropped upon the King's <HI>Maki&s;ies,</HI> and then with a Cord about his Neck was dragg'd upon the Ground to a broad Way, to which Malefactors are drawn, which cannot bear the trial of the <HI>Bonde.</HI></P>
<P>When the King hath done eating, he goes accompanied in State with the Nobility, Officers, and common People, to his Banquetting-hou&s;e, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;umptuous Structure in all his Court, &s;cituate on a Plain, fenced with Palm-Tree Boughs; wherein the mo&s;t difficult cau&s;es of difference, are decided and determin'd in his pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>When the Inhabitants of <HI>Lovango</HI> have lodged a Leopard in the Woods, every one is warned by the &s;ound of Trumpet to be ready to attend the King at the Game. If it be far without the City into the Woods, the King is carried in a four-&s;quare Seat, about two Foot deep, made of black Tin, and artificially wrought, by four Men, two before and two behind, holding two Poles, on each &s;ide one, covered with blue Cloth.

<P>Afterwards the King appoints divers Noble-men to over&s;ee the Stripping of the Leopard, and bring the Skin to him; but the Fle&s;h, together with the Bowels, the Gaul only taken out, they bury very deep in the Earth, that it may not be digged up again.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Leopards Gaul is Poy&s;on.</NOTE> The Gaul, which they reckon to be a mo&s;t venomous Poy&s;on, they cut up in the pre&s;ence of many, and fling into the mid&s;t of a River, that none might make u&s;e thereof to the damage of another.</P>

<P>Then they make many little Images of Wood and Red Earth, and &s;et round about the Corps, Repre&s;entatives of his Servants and Hou&s;hold-goods.</P>
<P>Next, the Bodies of many Slaves are &s;et by the Corps, either in the &s;ame or &s;ome adjoyning Vault, to &s;erve the King, as they believe, in the other World, and to &s;hew when they &s;hall come to the great Monarch, what manner of Per|&s;on he has been here: for they believe after this another Life, yet in general deride the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</P>

<P>They yet make another &s;ort more ridiculous than any of the former; the manner thus: They take an ordinary round Pot without feet, which they fill with red and white earth, kneaded together with water, a pretty heighth above the upper edges, which they mark on the out&s;ide quite round with white &s;treaks, and &s;tripe it upon the top, with variety of Colours.</P>

<P>The&s;e prepar'd and made ready, a Fellow brings a Drum to a plain place, whereon no Trees grow, about whom all the Undertakers, Friends and Relati|ons, make a Ring; whereupon the Drummer &s;tanding in the middle, begins to beat, and &s;ing before the Conjurer, who begins to Dance, followed by every one, while he with an open throat, chants forth the prai&s;es of the <HI>Moki&s;e,</HI> de|&s;iring his aid; the Undertaker al&s;o (if in health) Dances about the Drum, two or three days, without perceiving any thing of the Devil all that time.</P>

<P>Being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, he makes ugly wry faces, and &s;tretching his body in un|&s;eemly po&s;tures, with terrible &s;hreeks, takes fire in his hands, and bites with|out hurting him&s;elf; &s;ometimes their Devils take him away from them all, and carry him into the wilderne&s;s to &s;ome de&s;olate place, where he &s;ticks over his whole body green Leaves: During this ab&s;ence, which hath no &s;et time of continuance, his friends u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible endeavors to find him out, but in vain.

<P>The Devil being thus entred, and he Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, he lieth as it were dead; then the Conjurer asketh what &s;hall be inflicted upon him? whereto the Spirit makes an&s;wer, by the mouth of the Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and lays his injunction upon him: upon this they begin again to &s;ing and to dance, till the Devil comes out of him again; then a Ring is put about his Arms, to put him in remem|brance of his task.</P>
<P>When the&s;e people Swear, they Swear by this Ring, wi&s;hing, <HI>That Devil who cau&s;eth them to wear this Ring, may break their necks if it be not true;</HI> which is the &s;ooner believed, becau&s;e they will not &s;wear lightly, nor to any thing but the truth; they infallibly keep their words in what they promi&s;e, though to the hazard of their lives, as hath often appear'd.

<P>By the word <HI>Moki&s;ie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What <HI>Moki&s;ie</HI> fignifies.</NOTE> they mean a natural Super&s;tition, and firm Per&s;wa&s;ion that they have of &s;omething, to which they a&s;cribe an invi&s;ible power, in working good to their advantage, or evil to their prejudice and detriment, or from whom they expect to learn the knowledge of pa&s;t or future things.

<P>Whatever they effect by it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vanity of the <HI>Moki&s;ie.</HI></NOTE> is done by meer imagination, or if by natural means, it happens more by chance, than any knowledge they have. Any man that is &s;ound, and determines to live after the manner of his <HI>Moki&s;ie,</HI> ob&s;erving temperance and cha&s;tity, takes the natural cour&s;e to pre&s;erve his health; but their ignorant &s;tupidity a&s;cribes it to the operation of the <HI>Moki&s;ie.</HI> On the other hand, if any be &s;ick, and u&s;e means for the recovery of health, the good &s;ucce&s;s thereof the <HI>Moki&s;ie</HI> gets the prai&s;e of, although the cau&s;e of the &s;ickne&s;s were re|mov'd by the goodne&s;s and bounty of nature, or the &s;trength of his con&s;titu|tion.

<P>The ancient u&s;e of this Common Cu&s;tom, &s;eems an infallible demon&s;trati|on to the be&s;otted people, of the great vertue of the <HI>Moki&s;ies,</HI> and it confirms them not a little in their fooli&s;h belief, becau&s;e they &s;ee their King and the Grandees of the Countrey, make it their work.</P>

<P>To this they add, two Baskets thick cover'd with Shells, Feathers, Iron Hooks, and an Herb fetcht from a far di&s;tant Mountain; in which they cut a hole where they pour in Wine, of which they give often to drink.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of the <HI>Maujeres</HI> de&s;erves well to be laugh'd at, for when they bring any thing upon the account of Trade, into another Countrey from home, perhaps forty or fifty miles, they mu&s;t have &s;uch a Sack of Trumpery, which &s;ometimes weighs ten or-twelve pounds, aloft upon their Pack, though the bur|den it &s;elf makes them ready to &s;ink under it; But they &s;ay, that it rather takes from, than adds to their carriage; whereby it appears, what effects the &s;trength of imagination can do.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of their Publick Devotions are &s;trange and ridiculous,

<P>When the Bonfires of <HI>Bomba</HI> are made, they lay many Drums upon the ground, which they beat with their hands and feet, &s;itting round about a Po&s;t that is &s;et in the middle; among which the Daughters of <HI>Kimbos-bombos</HI> all dance, moving their Bodies, Eyes, and Head, like mad Folks; and with ob|&s;cene Po&s;tures, &s;ing certain Ver&s;es, wearing upon their Heads a Bu&s;h of all &s;orts of colour'd Feathers, and on their Bodies &s;trange fa&s;hion'd Garments, with a red and white painted Rattle in each Hand. In brief, The more api&s;hly they behave them&s;elves, the freer and braver they are e&s;teem'd to be.

<P>This Cu&s;tom is not only us'd for the King, but al&s;o for the Nobility, ac|cording to their Quality, and continues to this day; but by the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, teaching better things, they have laid a&s;ide totally the burying of People alive.</P>

<P>The King after his Crowning remains eight days in his Palace, never going forth; in which time all the <HI>Black</HI> Nobility, none excepted, and all the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> come to vi&s;it and wi&s;h him good &s;ucce&s;s: the <HI>Blacks</HI> do him a kind of Homage, lying down upon both Knees, clapping their hands, and ki&s;&s;ing the King's Hand: the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;it kneeling upon one Knee, and &s;o the Prie&s;ts and Clergy, by that humble po&s;ture acknowledging his Soveraignty.</P>

<P>In the Planting and u&s;ing <HI>Mandikoka</HI> they practice this method: After the Earth is prepared, by being well wrought, beaten &s;mall, and thrown up in Hills like Mole-hills, little Twigs or Slips cut off from the Branches of it, about a Foot long, and an Inch thick, are &s;et &s;loaping one again&s;t another, on every Hill two or three Sticks, with the ends about a Hand-breadth above the Earth; which immediately take Root, and in nine, ten, or twelve Moneths, &s;hoot up to the heighth of twelve Foot, with many Branches, and a Body as big as a Man's Thigh: Then to make the Root grow large, the Ground mu&s;t be Weeded two or three times, and kept clean: And when it is grown to its perfect maturity, they cut the Stemm clo&s;e to the Earth, being good for no|thing but Fewel; but the &s;mall Boughs they fit for the next Planting,

<P>For this work many Hou&s;es are built, above a hundred Foot long, and thir|ty or forty Foot broad; wherein on both &s;ides &s;tand the Furnances, that is, on each &s;ide ten, and three Mills unfixt, and movable upon occa&s;ion from place to place.

The Land by the Sea-&s;ide &s;hoots down &s;o &s;teep and &s;loaping, that the Sea, not above a Musket-&s;hot from the Shore, hath above &s;even or eight and twenty Fathom Water; and a mile from thence a Line of a hundred Fathom can reach no ground.</P>

<P>As to the Air, quality of the Soyl, Plants, Bea&s;ts, Cu&s;toms, Food, Cloath|ing, Arms, Language, Religion and Wor&s;hip, of this people in general; we cannot &s;ay much, that little we &s;hall &s;peak, will have onely relation to the <HI>Hot|tentots,</HI> lying clo&s;e to the <HI>Cape,</HI> as the <HI>Garouchouquas, Goringhuiquas, Goringhaiconas, Cochoquas,</HI> or <HI>Saldanhans,</HI> great and little <HI>Cariguriquas,</HI> and <HI>Ho&s;aas;</HI> for of the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Vanouquas, Cabonas, Sonquas, Mamaquas, Heu&s;aquas, Brigoudys, Hancumquas,</HI> hitherto little or no information hath been had, other than that in general they agree with tho&s;e that lie neare&s;t to the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The Air about the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Good-Hope</HI> is always Serene,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE> Clear, and Tempe|rate, and by con&s;equence very Healthy, becau&s;e neither the Heat parches, nor the Cold pierces too much.

<P>The Vale-Winds,

<P>It Rains there in the Winter, that is, in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> &s;o extreamly, as if it did almo&s;t pour down, whereby the low grounds are laid under Water, yet with|out any prejudice; for after the falling away of the Water, the ground appears more fre&s;h and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Soyl about the <HI>Cape,</HI> is in &s;ome places very rich and ferile, fit to be Husbanded, and to produce all manner of Fruits; although other parts be full of Clay, Stony, Gravelly, or Sandy: &s;ome Trees grow here and there, but &s;o hard and knotty, as makes them fit onely for Fuel: yet the natives report, that in the Countrey there grow &s;uch Trees, that a hundred men may &s;helter them|&s;elves under one of them; perhaps the Indian Fig-Tree, by <HI>Lin&s;chot</HI> call'd <HI>Ar|bar de Rais.</HI></P>

<P>They have infinite flocks of Sheep, very large, with long Legs, and Hair in &s;tead of Wool; their tails are nothing but fat, and &s;ome of them &s;o heavy, that they have weigh'd eighteen or twenty pounds and more.</P>
<P>The Woods, Valleys, and plain low Gronds, feed many wild Bea&s;ts; as Stags or Harts, Roe-Hindes, and wild Cows, who run together by &s;ixty, &s;even|ty, yea a hundred in a Head. Badgers, of a red colour, but &s;o &s;low in running, that a man may ea&s;ily out&s;trip them, yet their fle&s;h is accounted a plea&s;ant food. Wild-Bears, Wild-Goats, Hares, Conies, Ring&s;treak'd Tygers, a fierce and dan|gerous Bea&s;t, Leopards, Wolves, <HI>Rhinocerots,</HI> and Elephants.</P>
<P>On the tops of the Mountains, keep multitudes of fierce Lions, which in dark Moons come out of their hideous Dens of &s;helter, and &s;eek their prey clo&s;e un|der the Fort; and therefore they always about the Inclo&s;ure (where the Cattel are kept in by night) kindle great fires to &s;care them away.</P>
<P>There are found great Bea&s;ts like Elephants, with two Horns at their No|&s;es, &s;uch as the <HI>Rhinocerots</HI> hath one.

<P>The Ocean al&s;o produces many Creatures, as Sea-Rabbits, Sea-Dogs, Sea-Wolves, or Sea-Bears, who in the Summer &s;wim in the Sea, but in the Winter remain under ground, and keep on Shore, and in the Cliffs.</P>
<P>The Sea-Wolves, or rather Sea-Bears, becau&s;e with their paws and ge&s;tures more re&s;emble Bears than Wolves, onely they have &s;harper Snouts, and are a fiercer Creature, biting cruelly; they exceed men for the mo&s;t part in &s;wift|ne&s;s of running, &s;o without two or three they are not to be taken.</P>
<P>On the Shore of the Rivers, are many Sea-Hor&s;es, Porcupi&s;&s;es, or Sea-Hogs, and Sea-Cats.</P>

They have &s;o &s;low a pace that we ea&s;ily catch them, or follow them to their Ne&s;ts, which they defend with biting, and are not to be forced thence without Staves.

<P>There appears al&s;o among them &s;ome &s;parks of Pride: for when they come to the <HI>Fort of Good Hope,</HI> they ca&s;t on their filthie&s;t, greazie&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;tinking Skins, and adorn their Ears and Necks with red and yellow Copper Beads, &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves exceeding pompou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the meanne&s;s and poverty of their Condition, yet they bear a high mind, and are ambitious; they will rather fall to open enmity, than
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>a</HI> Like our <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> bow or give any reverence to each other; and he that gets the Victory, doth not onely play the Lord for that one time, but always vaunts and braves it over his vanqui&s;hed Enemy.</P>

They find great reli&s;h in the Fle&s;h of Sea-Dogs, or Badgers, which they kill in the Night, coming by thou&s;ands on Shore, with Sticks, and either raw, or half cold, and unwa&s;hed, they broyl in the Fire, and eat; not forbearing the mo&s;t noy&s;om Grea&s;e of Whales and other Draff ca&s;t on Shore. Train-Oyl, and Grea&s;e of a Stranded Whale at the Salt-River, broyl'd out by the Sun, they &s;up up by whole handfuls, and cut Collops out of the Fle&s;h, which they bury under the Sand to eat after|wards. Some time they tear pieces of their dry'd hard Sheeps-skin Mantles or Cloaks, with their Teeth, and eat it.</P>
<P>They take great delight in our Bread, for which they are willing to barter Cattel. The Honey found in the Woods they eat up Wax an all; and in &s;tead of Phy&s;ick admini&s;ter to the Sick, Cabbages, Coleworts, and Mu&s;tard-Leaves, with a little beaten Lard boyl'd with it.</P>

In &s;tead of Hor&s;es they have great Oxen, who carry their Goods and Commodities from one place to another, which they lead and guide with a Stick thru&s;t through their No&s;es, as with a Bridle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cochoqua's,</HI> or <HI>Saldanhars,</HI> are a kind of Herd&s;men, and live by keeping of Cattel, whereof they have above an hundred thou&s;and Head, all very fair, be|&s;ides as many Sheep.

<PB N="593" REF="372">wild Bea&s;ts in the Night, whether Elephants, Elans, Rhinocerots, Lyons, Ty|gers, Bucks, or Hor&s;es, then all the &s;toute&s;t Men run forth, and make a great noi&s;e to fright them away. But if by day any devouring wild Bea&s;t appear, then all that can carry Arms go forth, every one provided with two or three <HI>A&s;&s;agays,</HI> or Lances, and encompa&s;&s;ing the &s;ame with extraordinary outcries and &s;houtings, they let fly their Darts, and Shoot, as at a Mark to wound and kill him.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on falls in Love with a Maid, he de&s;ires of his Father,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> that he may Marry her, who con&s;enting, he goes to the Father and Mother of the Maid, entreating the &s;ame: and when the Parents grant his Suit, the Daughter receives, and as a &s;ign of her acceptance, and in confirmation of the Marriage, &s;he puts about his Neck, not a Gold Chain, but a fat Cows Chitterling, which he mu&s;t wear till it drop off. Then two of the fatte&s;t Sheep are &s;ought out of the whole Flock, and kill'd, part of who&s;e Fle&s;h being boyl'd, and part of it roa&s;ted, none may eat but the Marry'd couple and their Parents; and with|out this Ceremony the Marriage would not be accounted lawful. The Skins cut in &s;mall pieces, and the Hair taken off, then beaten upon a Stone, and &s;o laid on hot Coals, they eat with a very great appetite. This pitiful Fea&s;t end|ed, the &s;olemnity of the Wedding is over.</P>
<P>As to their con&s;tancy in Love, they are as in other places, &s;ome quickly nau&s;eating the ties of Marriage, while others ob&s;erve it with a mo&s;t affectio|nate &s;trictne&s;s. For the manife&s;ting of the con&s;tancy and true Love among&s;t &s;ome of the&s;e Salvages, we will give you two remarkable Stories, the one of a Widow, which through exce&s;s of grief and &s;orrow for the death of her Hus|band, leapt into a Pit full of Wood, &s;et it on fire, and burnt her &s;elf to death: the other of a young Maid, which for grief threw her &s;elf down from a Rock, becau&s;e her Parents had caus'd her Lover to be &s;everely whipt with Thorns, for Lying with her again&s;t their con&s;ents.</P>
<P>Whether by the goodne&s;s of the Air, or the natural &s;trength of their Con&s;ti|tutions, the&s;e People attain &s;o great an age, as generally they do, remains a doubt; but this is certain, that mo&s;t of them live to eighty, ninety, or a hun|dred, and &s;ome to a hundred and ten, twenty, or more years.</P>
<P>They bury their Dead &s;itting in a deep Pit &s;tark naked,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals.</NOTE> throwing the Earth upon their Heads with a great heap of Stones over all, to pre&s;erve the Corps from being raked out of the Grave by wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>When a Man or Woman dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance.</NOTE> all the Friends to the third degree of Con&s;an|guinity, mu&s;t by an antient cu&s;tom cut off the little Finger of their left Hand, to be bury'd with the Dead in the Grave; but if the Decea&s;ed had in his Life any Cattel, and leaves &s;ome Relations to whom they might come by Inheri|tance, they mu&s;t cut off a Joynt from each little Finger before they can take the Cattel: for the Sick cannot giveaway the lea&s;t thing on his Death-bed, from tho&s;e to whom it falls by Inheritance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as any one falls &s;ick, tho&s;e about him fetch one skill'd in Herbs, who with a &s;harp two-edged Knife lets them blood on their Back, then burns them on their Arms, with a red hot Iron, and drops thereon &s;ome Juyce of Herbs, with new boyl'd &s;weet Milk: And if this work not a Cure, they give them over for Dead.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which rob in the Day, if they be catcht in it, are beaten by the King, or <HI>Choeque</HI> him&s;elf with a Stick, without other puni&s;hment; but tho&s;e which Rob in the Night, receive upon di&s;covery a more &s;evere puni&s;hment
<PB N="594" REF="373">in this manner inflicted. The Offender is fir&s;t for a whole day tied Hand and Foot, being neither allowed Meat or Drink: On the &s;econd day &s;ome of the Elde&s;t go to the <HI>Coehque,</HI> to ask if they &s;hall proceed in the Execution, which is done without any Condemnation or Tryal, but not without &s;ufficient Te|&s;timony; whereupon the King, with a great Train of People following him, comes to a Tree, where he commands the Offender to be brought before him, whom they bind to the Tree, and very &s;everely whip all over his Body, that the Blood runs down to his Feet. After this, being turned with his Face to|wards the King, a &s;ort of Gum, or Rozin, melted in a Pot, is poured over his naked Body, from his Neck running down upon his Brea&s;t, &s;o that the Skin immediately peels off; then they let him loo&s;e, and give him &s;ome Meat, wherewith a little refre&s;h'd, they tie him again Neck and Heels, and &s;o leave him three days: And la&s;tly, after the enduring all this pain, he is &s;ometimes bani&s;h'd, and thru&s;t from their Society.</P>
<P>When any are found in Fornication,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ince&s;t.</NOTE> the Parents force them to Marry imme|diately, if they have a competency of E&s;tate: But if that cannot be effected, then they wait to know if the Woman be with Child; and then they enforce a Conjunction, though the Per&s;on be &s;o mean that he cannot maintain a Wife.</P>
<P>When any Per&s;on, Rich or Poor, is di&s;cover'd to have committed Ince&s;t, they believe &s;uch People cannot be puni&s;hed enough, becau&s;e they &s;ay it is an unpardonable offence; and this from the meer Light of Nature: And there|fore they puni&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors with death; the manner this.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all the Man hath his Hands and his Feet drawn together with a Cord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are puni&s;h'd.</NOTE> and &s;o put into a Tub till the next day, and the Woman &s;et by it. The &s;econd day they take him out, and &s;o Manacled &s;et him under a Tree, fa&s;tning his Head to a &s;trong Bough, which one pulls and holds down; then they cut off one Member after another: Afterwards they let the Bough &s;pring up again, with the mangled Body upon it, for a Spectacle to other Evil-doers.</P>
<P>The Man thus dead, they bring forth the Woman, whom bound round about with many dry Shrub-Bavins, her Hands and Feet tied fa&s;t together, they &s;et Fire to the Bu&s;hes, and &s;o burn her to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>A little above five years ago it hapned that a certain Per&s;on, a great Friend and Acquaintance of the <HI>Coehques,</HI> or King of the <HI>Saldanhars,</HI> committed Ince&s;t; yet for all that, without re&s;pect to his Per&s;on, he did Ju&s;tice upon him.</P>
<P>If any Man of Wealth and Quality,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;hment for killing and wounding.</NOTE> or reputed Wi&s;e, through fury or rage &s;tab or wound another to death, they take him and beat his Brains out again&s;t a Tree, and put him into the Grave with the murdered Per&s;on; for they &s;ay, Such a Per&s;on being endued with more Under&s;tanding, ought to know better, and to give a good Example to others: Whereas on the other &s;ide, poor &s;im|ple People are permitted to ran&s;om their Lives by a Payment of Cattel. Some, for Offences which de&s;erve Death, have their Knees nail'd through, and an Iron Pin fa&s;t driven into each Shoulder, &s;o dying a lingring death.</P>
<P>They live like the <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hou&s;es.</NOTE> in the Fields, in Huts made of &s;lender crooked Poles, &s;et round and cover'd with Bulru&s;h-Mats: Some of the&s;e are &s;o large, that conveniently ten or twenty Men, with Women and Children, may dwell in one of them; though others are much le&s;s, and &s;ome &s;o &s;mall, that they can take them up, and run away with them. The Fire-place lieth in the mid&s;t of the Hou&s;e; but they make no Funnels to carry up the Smoke.</P>

<P>Some words they know not how to utter, but with very much ado, and they &s;eem as if they fetch'd it out behind, at the bottom of their Throats, and as the People in <HI>Savoy</HI> that live near the <HI>Alps,</HI> who by drinking Snow-water have great Crops or Swellings under their Chins. <HI>Brokwa</HI> in their Language &s;ig|nifies <HI>Bread, Kahou</HI> denotes to <HI>&s;it down, Bou</HI> is <HI>an Ox, Ba, a Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Kori, Iron:</HI> But now many of them which dwell clo&s;e to the Fort of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> by daily Conver&s;e with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> &s;peak <HI>Dutch;</HI> as &s;ome who have been with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Bantam,</HI> &s;tammer &s;ome broken <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>They have no inclination to Trading,

But at this day, grown wi&s;er by Conver&s;e, and the abundance of Commodities carried thither, they prize their Cattel at a much higher rate, and their former fair dealing is not now found among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Tobacco, Brandy, and Copper, they chiefly de&s;ire at pre&s;ent; but the yel|lower the better: So that for four pieces of Copper, as big as the Palm of ones Hand, and a piece of Tobacco, they u&s;ually buy two Cows.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e People have Elective, others Succe&s;&s;ive Kings or Governors;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> but all their Powers not able to make above four or five thou&s;and Men, and tho&s;e living di&s;per&s;edly in &s;everal Plantations, far di&s;tant from each other.</P>
<P>Religion is an ab&s;olute &s;tranger among all the&s;e Salvages,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> in&s;omuch that they never wor&s;hipped either God or Devil; yet they &s;ay and believe there is a Divine Power, which they call <HI>Humma,</HI> which cau&s;eth Rain, Winds, Heat, and Cold; but will not wor&s;hip him, becau&s;e he &s;ends &s;ometimes too much Heat and Drowth, and another time an overflux of Rain, contrary to their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Secondly, They imagine, that they can &s;top the Rain, and allay the Wind at their plea&s;ure. Fir&s;t, To cau&s;e Rain to cea&s;e, they lay a &s;mall Cole of Fire on a Chip, in a little Hole digged in the Ground; and upon that Hole they lay a Lock of Hair pull'd from their Heads, and cover up the Hole with Sand; when the Hair begins to &s;tink, then they make Water upon it, and &s;o run away &s;hrieking. To lay the Winds, they hold one of the grea&s;ie&s;t Skins upon a long Stick aloft in the Air, till the Wind has blown down the Skin; and then vainly think the power of the Wind &s;mothered thereby.</P>
<P>When the New Moon begins fir&s;t to be di&s;cerned, they commonly in great Companies turn them&s;elves towards it, and &s;pend the whole night in great joy, with Dancing, Singing, and Clapping of Hands.</P>

<PB N="606" REF="379">again after three years Voyage, loaden with Gold, and Elephants-Teeth. We conceive it not unfit in brief to relate the difference of the ancient Con|te&s;t about this place, hitherto clearly decided, with the Arguments on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><HI>Arias Montanus, Baftellus, Goropius,</HI> and others, are of opinion, that <HI>Ophir</HI> was that part of <HI>America,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Peru;</HI> and divided North, and South <HI>Peru:</HI> therefore they conclude from the word <HI>Parvaim,</HI> in the Hebrew Text, being the Plural Number, and that this Gold was brought from the two <HI>Peru's;</HI> but ma|ny oppo&s;ite Arguments refel this Opinion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It is probable, that <HI>Peru</HI> in the time of <HI>Solomon</HI> was not known; nor which is more, the Voyage to <HI>Peru,</HI> over &s;o wide a &s;pace of Seas, not po&s;&s;ible to be perform'd, e&s;pecially for want of the u&s;e of the Load-&s;tone and Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, There are in <HI>Peru</HI> no Elephants; &s;o that by con&s;equence, from thence no Ivory, or Elephants Teeth could be brought.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If <HI>Solomon</HI> were to go with a Fleet to <HI>Peru</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> it might have been &s;ent more conveniently out of &s;ome Haven of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>-Sea, as be|ing nearer than out of <HI>Ezien-geber,</HI> at the Red-Sea, to fetch &s;o long a compa&s;s, by the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and the whole <HI>Guinee-Coa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> an ingenious Expounder of the Hebrew, who in the year Four hundred twenty two, in the Nineteenth year of his Age, departed this world under <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Emperor, by the word <HI>Ophir,</HI> under&s;tands good or pure Gold; and in his Tran&s;lation &s;ets down very good Gold, and not Gold of <HI>Pa|ruaen,</HI> or of any Countrey: but this opinion al&s;o is long ago rejected.</P>
<P><HI>Athana&s;ius Kircher,</HI> in his Book of the <HI>Coptick</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language, a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>Ophir</HI> is a <HI>Coptick,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> word; whereby the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> under|&s;tood the <HI>Indies,</HI> containing the Kingdoms of <HI>Malabar, Scilon,</HI> and the <HI>Golden-Cher|&s;one&s;us,</HI> or the de&s;cending Countrey of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> about the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> Ea&s;t|ward of a Bay, by him call'd, <HI>The Great;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Sumattra,</HI> the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, Great, and Little <HI>Java;</HI> and other adjacent I&s;lands full of Gold, whither King <HI>Solomon's</HI> Fleet went with King <HI>Hiram:</HI> The Gold of <HI>Parvaim, Kircherus</HI> judg|eth was the Gold of <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Javim,</HI> that is, of the I&s;lands of <HI>Java;</HI> having read in the Rabbins, the&s;e two I&s;lands by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>In &s;etting <HI>Ophir</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;t-Indie,</HI> (as <HI>Kircher</HI> doth) and not in <HI>America,</HI> the chief|e&s;t Geographers agree; as <HI>Ortelius, Volaterranus, Gramas,</HI> and others; yet divers make <HI>Ophir</HI> the &s;ame with <HI>Sofala,</HI> becau&s;e it has much Gold, and Ivory. And if all the main Land (included between the Rivers <HI>Magnice,</HI> and <HI>Quama,</HI> and &s;ub|mitting unto <HI>Monomotapa</HI>) be all as <HI>Barros, Calles,</HI> or <HI>Sofala,</HI> as well as the re&s;t on the Sea-Coa&s;t, it may with great rea&s;on be judg'd, that this Countrey can be no other than the Golden <HI>Ophir</HI> of <HI>Solomon;</HI> partly becau&s;e of the Hou&s;es there to be found, near the Gold-Mines; not built after the manner of the Coun|trey, but &s;eem the work of Foreigners; and partly, becau&s;e of the In&s;criptions in &s;trange and unknown Letters. Moreover, <HI>Thomas Lopez</HI> in his Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> affirms, that among the Inhabitants of this Countrey, there remain Books which &s;hew, that <HI>Solomon</HI> every three year had his Gold thence. Be&s;ides the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Interpreters have Tran&s;lated the word <HI>Ophir,</HI> into the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which agrees very near with <HI>Sofala.</HI> And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;torio|grapher, calleth it <HI>Indian-Ophir;</HI> adding moreover, that in his time it was call'd <HI>The Gold-Countrey.</HI> A certain Writer, call'd <HI>Eupolemeus,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> calleth it <HI>Ophir Ureten,</HI> and &s;aith, 'tis an I&s;land of the Red-Sea, from whence they u&s;ed to Fraight Ships to <HI>Melanis,</HI> a City in <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>

<P>They wor&s;hip the Moon, becau&s;e they hold her to be the Mother and Cau&s;e of all things; and therefore in great Droughts they &s;et one among them in a certain place, and make a Circle round about him, out of which he mu&s;t not &s;tir, upon pain of death, but there mu&s;t continue ten days wor&s;hipping the Moon; within which time if it doth not Rain, they cut off his Hand.

<P>Every Temple, of which there are many, hath a <HI>Caciz,</HI> call'd by them <HI>Hoda|mo,</HI> that is, a Governor or Judge in Church-matters; but holds the Office but one Year, which he enters upon by receiving a Staff, the Badge of his Authori|ty, and wearing always a Cro&s;s of a Span and half long about him, which he may not part with upon pain of the lo&s;s of his Hand. In the Temples, whereinto at the Ri&s;ing and Setting of the Moon they enter, they u&s;e a Stick of two or three Spans long, upon which with another Stick they give certain Strokes, thrice in the Day, and thrice in the Night; held by them for a Work of great Holine&s;s: Afterwards they go in Proce&s;&s;ion three times round about the Church-yard, turning thrice after every Circuit; then they take an Iron Pan, made in form of a plain deep Scale, hanging upon three Chains,

<P><HI>Geminiano</HI> a Je&s;uit averr'd, that in former times the Red-Sea overflow'd all <HI>Egypt,</HI> and by its Water took away the colour from the green &s;pringing Soyl; but after the Water began to fall away and le&s;&s;en, it remain'd at length with &s;o little moi&s;ture, that the Sun-beams, which &s;hine down in that place with very great power, make a reflexion of the red Sand from the bottom, which &s;eem|ing to give a tincture to the Water from its ruddine&s;s, gave the occa&s;ion of de|nominating it the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> though <HI>Pliny</HI> will have it from a King, who Reigned here, and in <HI>Greek</HI> was call'd <HI>Erithreos,</HI> that is, <HI>Red.</HI> To this Opinion inclin'd <HI>Pomponius Mela, Ari&s;totle,</HI> and others: But <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> is of a contrary Judg|ment, maintaining, that this Sea was call'd the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who were drown'd in it when they pur&s;u'd the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in the Year after the Crea|tion, Two thou&s;and three hundred fifty and four, according to the computa|tion of <HI>Michael Zapuler,</HI> in his De&s;cription of the <HI>Holy Land. Johannes de Ca&s;tro,</HI> formerly Vice-Roy to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> affirms, that the red colour of this Sea, ari&s;eth from the great quantity of Corral growing at the bottom. Others, that the Rivers which pour into this in the mid&s;t of Winter, having flow'd through Countreys of a red colour'd Earth, make the Water &s;eem red, and con&s;equently gave it the Name.

<P>In this Sea are many &s;trange and remarkable things, as Trees growing, Branches of Corral, Mu&s;hroms, Meremaids, flying Fi&s;hes, and other wondrous Creatures.

And out of that conceit, when in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one, one was taken alive in the <HI>Nyle,</HI> by the City <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> the <HI>Bey</HI> or Governor of the City, com|manded it pre&s;ently to be put into the Water again, though a <HI>Venetian</HI> had bought it for five and twenty <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> and rather than incur the hazard, re|turn'd him his Money.</P>

<P>Afterwards this People, together with the <HI>Copticks,</HI> receiv'd the Doctrine and Errors of <HI>Dio&s;corus</HI> and <HI>Eutiches,</HI> and elected a Patriarch to over&s;ee the Church, who hath his chief Re&s;idence in the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and appoints a Sub&s;titute in <HI>Aby&s;sine</HI> nam'd <HI>Eteche,</HI> or <HI>Chomos,</HI> who hath many Bi&s;hops under him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aby&s;sines</HI> (captivated with the de&s;tructive Opinions of <HI>Eutiches</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;corus</HI>) believe, That the Souls of the Saints, after their death, do not go di|rectly to Heaven, but to the terre&s;trial Paradice, to remain there till the day of Judgment; That the Wicked do not go immediately to Hell, but to a place near adjacent, in which they can &s;ee the Puni&s;hment prepared for them, wait|ing in the mean while for the day of Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez</HI> affirms, that they conclude a Purgatory, and believe that the Souls of the vertuous are not plagued there on Saturdays and Sundays, and that Alms-deeds do exceedingly &s;erve for the mitigating of their pain; but deny that their <HI>Eteche,</HI> or Patriarch, can grant Souls any liberty to go out, judging that onely to belong to God, who hath limited, or &s;et the time of their puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Godignus</HI> affirms, that Children are Baptiz'd with Fire and Water, imprinting a Mark upon their Foreheads, which they mu&s;t carefully keep; for they hold it fit to follow the Rule which the Forerunner of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;eems to have Preach|ed,

<P>Between the Religion or Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Egyptians, Copticks,</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;sines,</HI> there is no difference at all; for both the&s;e People perform the Ma&s;s in the &s;ame manner, and con&s;ent in the Church Ceremonies, which they ob&s;erve in the Con&s;ecration of the Body and Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which they perform in this manner: The Prie&s;t at the appointed hour comes into the Church, and when the People are a&s;&s;embled, in his Prie&s;tly Ve&s;tments a&s;cends to the Altar, the Deacon crying with a loud voyce in the <HI>Coptick</HI> Tongue, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Participa|tion;</HI> whereupon the Prie&s;t, turning to the People, with a loud voyce often re|peats the&s;e words, <HI>Chri&s;t be with us all,</HI> and the the People an&s;wer, <HI>And with thy &s;pirit;</HI> After &s;everal Ceremonies perform'd, with Songs of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;|giving, and at la&s;t Prayers being ended, the Prie&s;t ble&s;&s;eth the Cover, the Cha|lice or Cup, the Spoon and Shrine, or Coffer of the Sacrament, by which they under&s;tand, <HI>The Ark of the Covenant,</HI> as by the Spoon, <HI>The Spear of Christ,</HI> and be|gin the Participation, with &s;tretched out hands, thus:</P>

<P>In the &s;ame manner it is done by the <HI>Copticks.</HI> That the <HI>Coptick</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;sine</HI> Church hath been one and the &s;ame from all Antiquity, <HI>Nicephorus, Zonoras, Cedrenus,</HI> and la&s;tly the <HI>Aby&s;sine</HI> Rituals them&s;elves, do te&s;tifie; for the common Liturgy, the Admonition that is made of Praying for the welfare of the <HI>Aby&s;|&s;ine</HI> Church, for the King and Princes of the Empire, Judges and Subjects, there is al&s;o in particular made mention of the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>Pray for our Prince, and our Patriarch, <HI>N. N.</HI> Lord and Head of the Bi&s;hops of the great Territory of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and for our Reverend Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Mark,</HI> the Head of our Countrey, and for all Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and true believing Mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P>In other Admonitions, the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Mark, Theon, Petrus, Alexander, Athana|&s;ius, Theophilus, Cyrillus,</HI> and other Patriarchs of <HI>Alexandria</HI> are remembred; which abundantly &s;hew, that the <HI>Egyptian, Coptick,</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;sine,</HI> are in effect but one Church.

<P><HI>Godignus,</HI> again&s;t the opinion of many, maintains they have no Bi&s;hops; but others, that the <HI>Eteche</HI> hath twelve Suffragans under him.</P>
<P>A Clerk may have one Wife, but is not made Prie&s;t till three years after that. After the death of the fir&s;t Wife no Prie&s;t may Marry again, but by &s;pe|cial con&s;ent of the <HI>Eteche;</HI> yet then he may never celebrate Ma&s;s any more: a matter &s;o &s;everely ob&s;erved by them, that they do not &s;o much as touch a Candle Con&s;ecrated for the Church.</P>
<P>If a Clerk or Prie&s;t get a Ba&s;tard-Child, they in&s;tantly put him out of his Office; and if he dies without lawful Children, his Goods E&s;cheat to the King.</P>
<P>They have many Monks, which follow the Rules of <HI>St. Anthony, St. Maccair,</HI> and <HI>St. Ba&s;il:</HI> They accommodate them&s;elves every where to the Clergy, which they boldly vi&s;it, do great Penance, live &s;oberly, and Fa&s;t often.</P>
<P>All the Clergy, to the very <HI>Eteche,</HI> and Bi&s;hops, dwell in Cloy&s;ters, in the Cities, and in the Wilderne&s;&s;es: they go bare-foot, never eat Fle&s;h, nor drink Wine, and do be&s;ides unu&s;ual &s;evere Penance: for be&s;ides Fa&s;ting, they tor|ment them&s;elves terribly, by being bound to a Cro&s;s, and &s;o &s;et for a whole day broyling in the Sun.

Others &s;it with a great Stone about their Necks, which &s;o bows down their Heads that they cannot look up to Heaven, nor move them&s;elves from the places where they are.</P>

<P>The Confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins they &s;ay they have by Apo&s;tolical command, which they make &s;tanding; after which they receive Ab&s;olution. <HI>Godignus</HI> avers, that they neither make known the particulars, nor the number of their &s;ins, but &s;ay onely in general, <HI>Habe&s;&s;en, Habe&s;&s;en,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>I have &s;inn'd, I have &s;inn'd.</HI> They hold onely five mortal &s;ins, fixing upon the la&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> which excludes out of the holy City, Sorcerers, Fornicators or Adulterers, Murderers, Idolaters and Lyars.

<P><HI>I have been hungry, and ye have not fed me; I have been thir&s;ty, and you have not given me drink; I have been a &s;tranger, and you have not let me in; I have been naked, and you have not clothed me; I have been &s;ick, and you have not vi&s;ited me; I have been in pri&s;on, and you have not come to me:</HI> Believing that <HI>Christ</HI> will &s;ay to Reprobates onely the&s;e words at the la&s;t Day.</P>
<P>They perform Ma&s;s daily, yet no more but one in every Church, and that u&s;ually in the Evening, an hour and a half before the going down of the Sun, except on <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays.</HI></P>
<P>They ordinarily bury their Dead with a Cro&s;s and Prayers, reading over them the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>St. John,</HI> the next day give &s;ome Alms for the benefit of their Souls.</P>

<P>Some of the Clergy in the Cloy&s;ters always eat Fle&s;h, becau&s;e they lie far from the Sea, and have no Lakes nor Rivers, out of which to take Fi&s;h. Others eat on Fa&s;ting-days but onely an Apple, with Bread and Water, or el&s;e &s;ome Herbs boyl'd, without Oyl or Butter; and &s;ome onely Bread and Water.

<P>Formerly there lived on the I&s;land <HI>Ontay&s;atrouha,</HI> lying between the <HI>Anachi|mou&s;si</HI> and the River <HI>Ranoumene,</HI> a People which held conver&s;ation with their Neighbors, but Warred again&s;t them continually: and not onely again&s;t them, but likewi&s;e again&s;t all others that travel'd through their Countrey. They cut the &s;ick Peoples Throats which they thought pa&s;t recovery, and brought their Hands to the King to eat.</P>
<P>They feed many Cows, but neither kill them, nor Steers, Rams, Goats, nor Cocks (Cows Milk being their chiefe&s;t Diet) and therefore Heifers, Sheep, and Goats, they bring to &s;leep upon Mats, and after their death bury them under ground. They did eat Dogs with a great appetite, when no longer fit for Boar-hunting. They till'd their Ground in the &s;ame manner as the other <HI>Blacks</HI> on this I&s;land. Their Features are frightful and ill-favor'd, for they have &s;mall Eyes, a broad Forehead, &s;harp Teeth, <HI>Camo&s;ie</HI> No&s;es, thick Lips, with &s;hort curl'd Hair, ru&s;&s;et Skins, without Beards, great Belly'd, and thin Legs.

<P>Some have reported that Giants and Dwarfs have been found on this I&s;land; but occular experience hath proved that A&s;&s;ertion but a Fable. In a Tract of Land by <HI>Itapere</HI> are many Stones erected, under which the Dwarfs are &s;aid to lie buried; for (&s;ay the Learned) they came in great numbers, and would have committed Spoil in the Countrey of <HI>Ano&s;si,</HI> whence they had been driven to the River <HI>Itapere:</HI> but when for want of Boats they could not come over, they were all &s;lain by the Inhabitants, and buried; who for a remem|brance of the Victory, rai&s;ed the&s;e Stones as a Monument.</P>

Their Recreations are barbarous &s;hriekings, which they term Sing|ing, and antick skrewing of their Bodies in &s;tead of Dancing. Man-like Exer|ci&s;es they hate, alledging, that all things laborious bring much more di&s;plea|&s;ure and vexation, than delight: The&s;e mock at the <HI>French</HI> when they &s;ee them walk, and count them Fools for wearying them&s;elves without a cau&s;e.</P>

Their chiefe&s;t handy|work is in building of Hou&s;es, working of Iron and Gold, Turning, making of Pots, Spinning, Weaving, Rope-making, Fi&s;hing, Hunting, and above all, (as already mention'd) cultivating the Ground.</P>

Per&s;ons of Quality have their Hair &s;haven off, and Women have a Quoif put on: but before that is done, all the Acquaintance, Friends, and Slaves of the Decea&s;ed come into the Hou&s;e of the Dead, lamenting round about the Corps, at who&s;e Feet a Candle &s;tands burning night and day.

<P>The &s;olemne&s;t and highe&s;t Oath which they take,

<P>Among all the Inhumanities of the&s;e &s;alvage People,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An abominable deed in for&s;aking their Children.</NOTE> the mo&s;t horrible and abominable is, that the People of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> do cruelly ca&s;t away their Chil|dren; &s;o that Men have no cau&s;e at all to wonder, why this I&s;land, &s;o large and fertile, falls &s;hort in the account of populo&s;ity, becau&s;e from the Birth tho&s;e Innocents are condemn'd to lo&s;e the light of the Day, before they have &s;carce &s;een it, &s;uffering it to peri&s;h by the &s;otti&s;h and damnable advice of their <HI>Ombya&s;&s;es,</HI> or Prie&s;ts, who coun&s;el the Fathers to leave their Children, and cau&s;e them by a Slave to be carry'd far from the Town, and under &s;ome Hedge, or in the Woods, to be expos'd to the mercy of Wind and Weather, Dogs, wild Bears, and other devouring Bea&s;ts, where at la&s;t with much cry|ing and lamenting, they fami&s;h for Hunger and Thir&s;t, or are cruelly de|vour'd.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e why they do thus de&s;troy their new-born Children is, that they believe them born in an unlucky Day, Moneth, or Hour, and the rather, when the <HI>Ombya&s;&s;e</HI> &s;ees, that the Configuration of the Childs Planets do not &s;erve his purpo&s;e, then &s;ays that the Child will be a Murtherer of his Father and Mother, and his Life unfortunate, and inclin'd to do all manner of evil, and therefore mu&s;t be made away.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Moneths are e&s;pecially <HI>April,</HI> which they call <HI>Saffard,</HI> and the Fa&s;ting Moneth, <HI>Rama-hara;</HI> but in every Moneth the eighth Day, nam'd <HI>A&s;&s;aronton,</HI> and the la&s;t Quarter of the Moon, call'd <HI>Alcaco&s;&s;y. Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Fridays</HI> in every Week are ill Days, and the Hours which are govern'd by an evil <HI>Vitang,</HI> or Planet; &s;o that the&s;e People account almo&s;t half the Year un|lucky. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ome among them have a little more pity and compa&s;|&s;ion towards their Children, and after they have &s;o barbarou&s;ly expos'd them, let their Slaves (their Maid-Servants) go in&s;tantly, and take it thenceand Suckle it: however, they account it no more theirs, but appropriate to the Per&s;on that takes it up, or the Nur&s;e. Others are &s;atisfi'd by performing <HI>Fa|lis</HI> for their Children, that is, they &s;acrifice Bea&s;ts and Hens, and &s;hut them half a day (as they &s;ay) to prevent the malign influence of the Con&s;tellation that reigns over them: for if they &s;hould let them live, and not perform this,

If a Woman, when &s;he is great with Child, and is very &s;ick, or has hard Labor, they impute the fault to the Child, and the Woman orders them to kill, or to bury it alive.</P>
<P>If the Daughter of a <HI>Rohandrian</HI> hath had to do with a <HI>Negro</HI> before &s;he be Married (as they all do, none excepted) &s;he either cau&s;es an Abortion, or, if &s;he be deliver'd, makes away the Child.</P>

Their u&s;ual Drink is warm Water, or the Broath wherein they boyl their Meat. They make Wine of Honey; yet they drink it not, but in their <HI>Mi&s;&s;avat&s;i,</HI> and chief Solemnities.</P>
<P>They &s;peak but one Language through the whole I&s;land;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> but very different in the Tone and Pronunciation; &s;ome giving them a &s;hort, and &s;ome a long Accent.</P>
<P>This Language hath much affinity with the Ea&s;tern, e&s;pecially the <HI>Arabick;</HI> and great agreement with the <HI>Greek,</HI> as well in the manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, as in the connexing of Names and Compound-words. Every thing is call'd accord|ing to the Action, or manner of Operation by which it is effected: as, a bro|ken Tree, or Stick, they call <HI>Hazonfaulac;</HI> a torn Cloth, <HI>Sichinrota;</HI> a broken Pot, <HI>Vilanghavakqui;</HI> broken Thred, <HI>Foulomaitou;</HI> and &s;o many other things: which expre&s;&s;eth the copiou&s;ne&s;s of the Tongue.</P>

<P>They know and believe indeed, That there is a God, who hath made Hea|ven and Earth, and all Creatures, and innumerable Angels; but reverence or wor&s;hip him not: They live according to the Law of Nature, without fear|ing him; but make indeed Confe&s;&s;ion of their Sins, e&s;pecially decripit old Men, upon their Death-Beds. They believe al&s;o, That there is a Devil, whom they greatly fear, and call <HI>Taiwaddey:</HI> That God is all Good, and doth no Evil: That he gives Life to Men, and all Creatures, and bereaves them of it again at his plea&s;ure: That the Devil is the Author of all Evil and Mi&s;chief: That he &s;ends all Sickne&s;&s;es and Mi&s;haps into the World; cau&s;eth all Quarrels, Thefts, and Murthers; and is the Original of Evil: Therefore they Sacrifice unto him, to appea&s;e him; they pray fir&s;t to him, and name the Devil, before God: But they Pray al&s;o to a Third Power, under the Name of <HI>Dian Manang,</HI> that is, <HI>God, or Lord of Riches,</HI> which they acknowledge to be <HI>Gold;</HI> which when they &s;ee, or have in their Hand, with great Devotion they hold over their Heads, and ki&s;s it.

<P>The &s;eventh &s;ort of Spirits are call'd <HI>Biles,</HI> being, as they &s;ay, an infinite number, but all under a Supream, who is the broacher of all evil; &s;o that he &s;eems to be <HI>Lucifer,</HI> or the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>They believe, That God after the Creation of Heaven, Earth, and all Crea|tures, Created <HI>Adam</HI> of Earth, and plac'd him in Paradi&s;e, which they imagine to be in the Moon, or in the Sun; and after his &s;etling there, forbade him ei|ther to eat or drink, becau&s;e he had no need to do &s;o; though they &s;ay there were four Rivers, one of Milk, one of Wine, one of Honey, and one of Oil; be&s;ides all &s;orts of Fruits in abundance. But the Devil (thus they relate the manner of the Fall) with &s;ubtilty and treachery, went to <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>Why eat ye not of all the&s;e good Fruits? Why do you not drink of that good Wine, and Milk, and ta&s;te this delicious Honey and Oil?</HI> Whereupon <HI>Adam</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>That God had for|bidden him, which he dur&s;t not di&s;obey.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil thus driven away, &s;taid about two hours; then came again to <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;aid to him, <HI>That he came from God, to give him leave to eat of all that he had a mind to. Adam</HI> thus tempted to ta&s;te thereof, eat, and &s;atisfi'd him&s;elf to the full; but after the dige&s;tion of the Food, he had a provocation and de&s;ire to ea&s;e him&s;elf, which of nece&s;&s;ity he mu&s;t do in Paradi&s;e; whereupon, in&s;tantly the Devil went, and complain'd to God again&s;t <HI>Adam's</HI> bewraying of his <HI>Eden;</HI> &s;o that God for that cau&s;e drave him out of Paradi&s;e, and &s;ent him into the Coun|trey, where he gat a &s;welling in the Calf of his Leg, which continu'd &s;ix Moneths; and when the &s;welling brake, there came forth a young Maid, whereupon he &s;ent the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to God, to ask what he &s;hould do with that Maid; and the Angel return'd an&s;wer, <HI>That he &s;hould bring her up, and when &s;he came to years of maturity, &s;hould Marry her;</HI> which he did, and nam'd her <HI>Ra|bouna,</HI> that is, <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>After the current of &s;ome time, &s;he lay In of two Sons, which being grown to a man-like &s;tature, the Devil who hath a thou&s;and Tricks, betray'd them in this manner; He gave them an <HI>A&s;&s;agay</HI> or Javelin in their hands, arm'd with Iron at both ends, and rais'd a quarrel betwixt them two, &s;o that they both took hold of the <HI>A&s;&s;agays,</HI> and each took one end to pull it out of the others hands; but the Irons not fa&s;t Rivetted, by hard pulling came off, where each of them now having one, they &s;tuck one another in the Belly, and both died of their Wounds. The&s;e two Brothers were <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel.</HI></P>
<P>They add moreover, That <HI>Adam</HI> had many Children, which multiply'd ex|ceedingly; but becau&s;e Men were evil, and would no more know God, he &s;ent a Floud or Deluge upon the Earth; having before commanded <HI>Noah</HI> to build a great Ship, to &s;ave him&s;elf, with all his Friends and Family, Women and Children, and many Bea&s;ts, a Male and Female of every &s;ort; then God over|whelm'd pre&s;ently the whole face of the Earth, and all the remainder of Bea&s;ts, except four Mountains, that is to &s;ay, the Mountain <HI>Zaballicaf,</HI> in the North;

<P>The cau&s;e of this unwhol&s;omne&s;s hath been imagin'd to proceed from the over-great Heats, and damp Fogs.

<P>The rea&s;on of this double Winter &s;eems to proceed from the violent attra|ctions of Heat, caus'd by the &s;corching beams of the Sun, which &s;o fill the Air

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil.</NOTE> and of a yellowi&s;h Ru&s;&s;et Colour; and by rea&s;on of the many Mi&s;ts, which fall every Night, it grows &s;oft, like Wax, and becomes fit to produce all &s;orts of Grain, Fruits, and Plants. The goodne&s;s and fertility thereof appears by this; That &s;o &s;oon as a plain Place is left untill'd, or laid wa&s;te, Trees grow upon it, and &s;hoot up to a great height in few days, which the <HI>Blacks</HI> cut down and burn, to plant the Sugar-Canes in their A&s;hes, which grow every where in the Valleys, but yield le&s;s Juyce than tho&s;e in <HI>Bra&s;ile.</HI></P>
<P>The Canes Planted in the fore-mention'd A&s;hes, mu&s;t have five Moneths time to ripen in: For that which is Planted in <HI>January,</HI> is Cut in <HI>June;</HI> and that of <HI>February,</HI> in <HI>July:</HI> And in this manner they Cut and Plant all the Year through. The full-grown Canes, when cut, are grownd &s;mall in Water-Mills, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Ingenhas;</HI> or by the Labor of Slaves or Oxen, in places where there are no Rivers: Afterwards they put the Juyce into great Kettles, and boyl it over the Fire, to clean&s;e it; and with the Refu&s;e they feed the Hogs, which eating nothing el&s;e, grow exceeding fat, and are e&s;teem'd &s;uch whole&s;om and &s;weet Fle&s;h, that they Diet therewith the Sick, to recover them to their Health.</P>
<P>Seven Ships Lading of Sugar this I&s;land &s;ends forth every Year; that is, Four for <HI>Portugal,</HI> two for the <HI>Canary</HI> and <HI>Madera</HI> I&s;lands, and one for <HI>England:</HI> And there might be a great deal more made, and al&s;o whiter; but they want Pots and other Nece&s;&s;aries to clean&s;e it, and al&s;o Refiners to work it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have &s;ent for many Arti&s;ts from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> to make their Sugar whiter and harder; but could never effect the &s;ame, the Air making their Labor fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e it doth not &s;uffer it to dry: And therefore the Sugar-makers are nece&s;&s;itated to &s;et the Loaves upon low Planks inclos'd round, and to &s;et them upon Boughs of thick dry Wood, which being &s;et on Fire, make no Flame nor Smoak, but at length glimmer like glowing Coals, and &s;o dry it, as in Stoves. Before the coming of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> there grew no Sugar-canes, nor Ginger; but they brought them thither, and planted them.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen hundred forty five, there &s;tood on this I&s;land four and fifty Mills, which every one had their Moneths to grind, and could make every Year twelve or fourteen Tun of Sugar. In the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, there were &s;ixty one Mills, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ruin'd; &s;o that ever &s;ince they have for the mo&s;t part been able to do nothing, for want of Coppers, and Slaves to work.</P>
<P>The Corn never attains to its full growth, becau&s;e the over-fatne&s;s of the Soil, and the exceeding Moi&s;ture, hinders the due Ripene&s;s. There are many Vineyards, which have all the Year Grapes, both white and red, ripe and un|ripe; al&s;o &s;weet and &s;oure Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Pomegranates, <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts, Figs, Water-Melons, Peaches, Olives, Almonds, and &s;uch like; but the Fruits never grow to a full perfection, becau&s;e the&s;e Plants have need of a
<PB N="723" REF="444">clo&s;ing and drying Coolne&s;s, which here they want. The want of Corn, Nature hath &s;upply'd to the Inhabitants by Roots, as Potatoes, or <HI>Ignames,</HI> their u&s;ual and chiefe&s;t Food, of which they have four &s;orts; one call'd <HI>Benyn;</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Achorere;</HI> the third, <HI>Maniconge;</HI> and the fourth <HI>Saffranee,</HI> according to the Places from whence brought to this I&s;land. The two fir&s;t are the be&s;t; the one for its &s;weetne&s;s, and the other for its longe&s;t keeping good. The next is <HI>Mandihoka;</HI> but they eat little of it, rather &s;ending it to <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> they plant much of it; onely the Root grows nothing near &s;o thick there, as in the&s;e places. And here you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That the Juyce mu&s;t be pre&s;t out of the <HI>Bra&s;ilian Mandihoka,</HI> being &s;o hurtful and poy&s;onous, that if any one &s;hould chance to eat of it unpre&s;s'd, he would run the hazard of his Life: But on this I&s;land they immediately dry it as it is Grownd, with|out pre&s;&s;ing, of which none get any hurt or damage by eating.</P>
<P><HI>Banano's</HI> al&s;o, <HI>Bakovens, Ku&s;su</HI>-Apples, two or three &s;orts of <HI>Jojoos,</HI> or &s;mall <HI>Beews,</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI>-Wheat, or <HI>Maiz,</HI> may be had there; and <HI>Pe&s;igos,</HI> a Fruit grow|ing on a Tree of the &s;ame name, &s;omewhat hairy on the out-&s;ide, which mu&s;t be cut off; and then you have a little Meat, over a &s;oft Stone, yet plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te, and of a cooling quality.</P>
<P>Another Fruit call'd <HI>Kola,</HI> of the bigne&s;s of a Walnut, grows on very high Trees, in a light green Shell or Cod: It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in four or five &s;harp red Kernels, lying clo&s;e together; they ta&s;te like a raw Che&s;&s;nut, but &s;omewhat bitteri&s;h; yet a draught of Water after it, makes it &s;eem &s;weet. They drive a good Trade herewith to <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> whither they carry it by Shipping.</P>
<P>Neither do they want <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, out of which the Inhabitants make Wine, and out of the Kernel of the Fruit extract by Decoction Palm-Oyl, which they &s;end over to <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Cotton growing there, the Inhabitants make &s;ad and light blue co|lour'd Clothes, like tho&s;e of <HI>Benyn,</HI> but nothing neer &s;o good; however, tran&s;ported to <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> they yield &s;ufficient profit.</P>

<P>They cannot complain of want of Cattel, having Swine, Cows, Sheep, Goats, Rams, and &s;ome &s;mall Hor&s;es. Nor of Fowl; Turkeys, Gee&s;e, Tur|tle-Doves, Hens, Moor-Hens, Sparrows, Linnets, Paraquetoes, and &s;everal other &s;orts of Birds, breeding there in abundance.</P>
<P>Neither are the Sea or Rivers le&s;s kind, yielding &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h. In &s;hort, This I&s;land might with rea&s;on enough be term'd a happy Habitation, if the Air was but of a good temper.</P>
<P>The offen&s;ive Vermin are of three &s;orts: Wa&s;ps, much bigger than ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> grievou&s;ly tormenting all that go into the Woods upon any occa&s;ion: Pi&s;mires, which eat up all they find, even to the grown Sugar-Canes; but they die upon the change of Weather: And Rats, great Enemies al&s;o to the Su|gar-Plants.</P>

<P>During the War between the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the States of the <HI>Uni|ted Provinces,</HI> this I&s;land was in the year Sixteen hundred forty one, on the &s;e|cond day of <HI>October,</HI> overcome in the following manner. <HI>Jol,</HI> whom we men|tion'd before, landed with his People two Miles from <HI>Pavoa&s;on,</HI> by a Sugar-Mill at <HI>St. Anns,</HI> where he took his Repo&s;e that Night, and the next day the Ships came under the Ca&s;tle, and the Soldiers march'd thither by Land; where arriving, they found all void either of People or Garri&s;on; onely the place was Fortifi'd by &s;ix Pieces of Ordnance: From thence, having reduc'd it, they went to the great Fort, &s;urrounded with a Wall of twenty eight Foot

<P>There are many Salt-Pans, which after they have let in the Salt-Water, being &s;hut up, the heat of the Sun con&s;olidates, and brings to a Gray-Salt; but 'tis a toil&s;ome work to gather it, and yet more trouble&s;ome to get on Ship-board, becau&s;e the Boats are not without great danger of being &s;wallow'd up by the Whirlpits.</P>

<P><HI>St. Anthonio</HI> has many Woods, and therein &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits; as Oran|ges, Lemons, Dates, Pomegranates, Sugar-Canes, <HI>Bakovens,</HI> and Melons: One Orchard lieth in this I&s;land, of which nothing can be &s;een from Sea, but a high Palm-Tree, which the people of the Ships, in the Bay of <HI>St. Vincent</HI> di&s;cern plainly, and commonly &s;end their Boats to barter Knives, and other &s;uch &s;mall Toys for Fruit, with the people who have a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Governor; their number generally about five hundred, mo&s;t of them <HI>Blacks,</HI> who from another Orchard bring the Fruits upon A&s;&s;es to the Shore &s;ide, to &s;ell to the Sea-men.

In the a&s;cent of one Mile &s;ome of our Company grew very faint and &s;ick, di&s;order'd by Fluxes, Vomitings, and Agui&s;h Di&s;tempers, our Hor&s;es Hair &s;tanding upright like Bri&s;tles; and calling for &s;ome of our Wine, carried in &s;mall Barrels on a Hor&s;e, we found it &s;o wonderfully cold, that we could not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it, notwith&s;tand|ing the Air was very calm and moderate: but when the Sun was &s;et, it began to blow with &s;uch violence, and grow &s;o cold, that taking up our Lodging among the hollow Rocks, we were nece&s;&s;itated to keep great Fires in the Mouthes of them all night. About four in the morning we began to Mount again, and being come another Mile up, one of our Company fail'd, and was able to proceed no farther: Here began the <HI>Black Rocks.</HI> The re&s;t of us pur&s;u'd our Journey till we came to the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> where we began to travel again in a white Sand, being fitted with Shooes, who&s;e &s;ingle Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather, to encounter this difficult Pa&s;&s;age; having a&s;cended as far as the <HI>Black Rocks,</HI> which lay all flat like a plain Floor, we climb'd within a Mile of the very top of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and at la&s;t we gain'd the Summit; where we found no &s;uch Smoak as appear'd a little below, but a continuall per&s;piration of a hot and &s;ulphurous Vapor, that made our Faces extreamly &s;ore. All this way we found no con&s;iderable alteration of the Air, and very little Wind; but on the top it was &s;o impetuous, that we had much ado to &s;tand again&s;t it whil&s;t we drank the Kings Health, and fir'd each of us a Piece. Here al&s;o we took our Dinner, but found that our Strong-waters had lo&s;t their Vertue, and were almo&s;t in&s;ipid, while our Wine was more &s;piritous and brisk than before. The top, on which we &s;tood, being not above a Yard broad, is the brink of a Pit, call'd <HI>The Caldera,</HI> which we judg'd to be a Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot over, and near four&s;core Yards deep, in form of a <HI>Cone,</HI> hollow with|in like a Kettle, and cover'd over with &s;mall loo&s;e Stones, mixed with Sulphure and Sand, from among which i&s;&s;u'd divers Spiracles of Smoak and Heat, which being &s;tirr'd with any thing, puffs and makes a noi&s;e, and &s;o offen&s;ive, that we were almo&s;t &s;uffocated with the &s;udden emanation of Vapors upon the remo|ving one of the&s;e Stones, which were &s;o hot, as not ea&s;ily to be handled. We de|&s;cended not above four or five Yards into the <HI>Caldera,</HI> becau&s;e of the &s;lipperine&s;s under foot, and the difficulty; but &s;ome have adventur'd to the bottom. Other matters ob&s;ervable we di&s;cover'd none, be&s;ides a clear &s;ort of Sulphure, which lay like Salt upon the Stones. From this renown'd <HI>Pico</HI> we could &s;ee the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> fourteen Leagues di&s;tant; <HI>Palma,</HI> eighteen; and <HI>Gomera,</HI> &s;even; which interval of Sea &s;eem'd not much wider than the <HI>Thames</HI> about <HI>London.</HI> We di&s;cerned al&s;o the <HI>Herro,</HI> being di&s;tant about twenty Leagues, and &s;o to the outmo&s;t Limits of the Sea much farther. As &s;oon as the Sun appeared, the Shadow of the <HI>Pico</HI> &s;eem'd to cover, not onely the whole I&s;land, and the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> but the Sea to the very Horizon, where the top of the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> or <HI>Pico,</HI> vi&s;ibly appear'd to turn up, and ca&s;t its Shade into the Air it &s;elf, at which we were much &s;urpriz'd: But the Sun was not far a&s;cended, when the Clouds began to ri&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, as that they intercepted our Pro&s;pect both of the Sea and the whole I&s;land, except the tops onely of the &s;ubjacent Mountains, which &s;eem'd to pierce them through. Whether the&s;e Clouds do very &s;ur|mount
<PB N="738" REF="463">the <HI>Pico,</HI> we cannot &s;ay, but to &s;uch as are far below, they &s;eem &s;ometimes to hang above it, or rather wrap them&s;elves about it, as con&s;tantly when the We&s;t-winds blow; this they call <HI>The Cap,</HI> and is an infallible Progno&s;tick of en|&s;uing Storms. One of our Company who made this Journey again two years after, arriving at the top of the <HI>Pico</HI> before day, and creeping under a great Stone to &s;hroud him&s;elf from the cold Air, after a little &s;pace found him&s;elf all wet, and perceiv'd it to come from a perpetual trickling of Water from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found i&s;&s;uing from the tops of mo&s;t of the other Mountains, gu&s;hing out in great &s;pouts, al|mo&s;t as far as the huge Pine-Tree, which we mention'd before. Having &s;taid a while at the top, we all de&s;cended the &s;andy Way, till we came to the Foot of the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> which being &s;teep, even almo&s;t to a perpendicular, we &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed: And here we met with a Cave, about ten yards deep, and fifteen broad, being in &s;hape like an Oven, or <HI>Cupola,</HI> having a hole at the top near eight Yards over: This we de&s;cended by a Rope that our Servants held fa&s;t at the top, while with the other end, being fa&s;tned about our middles, we &s;wung our &s;elves, till being over a Bank of Snow, we &s;lid down, lighting upon it: we were forced to &s;wing thus in the de&s;cent, becau&s;e in the mid&s;t of the bot|tom of this Cave, oppo&s;ite to the overture at the top, is a round Pit of Water, like a Well; the &s;urface whereof is about a Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at top, and about &s;ix Fathom deep: We &s;uppo&s;ed this Water not a Spring, but di&s;&s;oved Snow blown in, or Water trickling through the Rocks. About the &s;ides of the Grot, for &s;ome heighth there is Ice and I&s;icles hanging down to the Snow: But being quickly weary of this exce&s;&s;ive cold place, and drawn up again, we continu'd our de&s;cent from the Mountains by the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age we went up the day before, and &s;o about five in the Evening arrived at <HI>Oratava,</HI> from whence we &s;et forth; our Faces &s;o red and &s;ore, that to cool them we were forced to wa&s;h and bathe them in Whites of Eggs. The whole heighth of the <HI>Pico</HI> in perpendicular, is vulgarly e&s;teem'd to be two Miles and a half. No Trees, Herbs, nor Shrubs, did we find in all the Pa&s;&s;age, but Pines; and among the whiter Sands a kind of Broom, being a bu&s;hy Plant; and on that &s;ide where we lay all night, a kind of <HI>Coalon,</HI> which had Stems of eight Foot high, and the Trunk near a Foot thick, every Stem growing in four &s;quares, and emerging from the Ground like Tufts of Ru&s;hes: Upon the edges of the&s;e Stems grow very &s;mall red Buttons, or Berries, which being &s;queezed, produce a poy&s;onous Milk; which falling upon any part of a Hor&s;e, or other Bea&s;t, fetches off all the Hair from the Skin immediately. Of the wi|ther'd Sticks of this Vegetable we made our Fire all night. This Plant is al&s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread over the I&s;land, and is perhaps a kind of <HI>Euphorbium.</HI></P>
<P>Of the I&s;land <HI>Teneriff</HI> it &s;elf, this account was given by a judicious and inge|nious Man, who lived twenty years in it, as a Phy&s;itian and Merchant; his opinion is, That the whole I&s;land being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brim&s;tone, did in former times take Fire, and blow up all, or near all at the &s;ame time; and that many Mountains of huge Stones calcin'd and burnt, which appears all over this I&s;land, e&s;pecially in the South-we&s;t part of it, were ca&s;t up, and rai&s;ed out of the bowels of the Earth at the time of that general Conflagration; and that the greate&s;t quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Center of the I&s;land, rai&s;ed up the <HI>Pico</HI> to that heighth at which it is now &s;een. And he &s;aith, That any one upon the Place, that &s;hall carefully note the &s;itua|tion and manner of tho&s;e calcined Rocks, how they lie, will ea&s;ily be of that
<PB N="739" REF="463">mind; for they lie (&s;ays he) three or four Miles almo&s;t round the bottom of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and in &s;uch order one above another almo&s;t to the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> as 'tis call'd, as if the whole Ground &s;welling and ri&s;ing up together by the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Brim&s;tone, the Torrents and Rivers of it, did with a &s;udden eruption rowl and rumble them down from the re&s;t of the Rocks, e&s;pecially (as is &s;aid before) to the South-we&s;t; for on that &s;ide from the very top of the <HI>Pico</HI> almo&s;t to the Sea-coa&s;t, lie huge heaps of the&s;e burnt Rocks one under another: and there &s;till remain the very tracks of the Brim&s;tone-Rivers, as they ran over this quarter of the I&s;land, which hath &s;o wa&s;ted the Ground beyond recovery, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom: But on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Pico,</HI> few or none of the&s;e Stones appear; and hence he concludes, That the <HI>Vulcanio</HI> di&s;charged it &s;elf chiefly on the South-we&s;t-&s;ide. He adds farther, That at the &s;ame time, Mynes of &s;everal Metals were blown up, &s;ome of tho&s;e cal|cined Rocks re&s;embling Iron, Oar, &s;ome Silver, and others Copper; particu|larly on the South-we&s;t part, call'd <HI>Azuleios,</HI> being very high Mountains, where never any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man but him&s;elf (that ever he heard of) was. There are va&s;t quantities of a loo&s;e blewi&s;h Earth, mixed with blew Stones, which have a yellow ru&s;t upon them, like that of Copper or Vitriol; as al&s;o many &s;mall Springs of Vitriol-water, where he &s;uppo&s;es a Copper Myne. And he was told by a Bell-Founder of <HI>Oratava,</HI> That he got out of two Hor&s;e-loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made two large Rings. And a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> who had been in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> told him, That his opinion was, there were as good Mynes of Gold and Silver there, as the be&s;t in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Thereabouts al&s;o are Nitrous-waters and Stones, cover'd over with a deep Saffron-colour'd ru&s;t, ta&s;ting of Iron. And farther, he mentions one of his Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth, or Oar, brought from the top of this &s;ide of the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirmed by the la&s;t In&s;tance of the <HI>Palm-I&s;land,</HI> eighteen Leagues from <HI>Teneriff,</HI> where, about twelve years &s;ince, &s;o <HI>Vulcanio</HI> was fixed, the violence whereof made an Earthquake in this I&s;land, &s;o great, that he and others ran out of their Hou&s;es, fearing they would have fall'n upon their Heads. They heard the noi&s;e of the Torrent of flaming Brim&s;tone like Thunder, and &s;aw the Fire as plain by night for &s;ix weeks toge|ther, as a burning Torch, and &s;o much Sand and A&s;hes, brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds, fell upon his Hat, as would fill the Sand-box of his Ink|horn.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places of this I&s;land groweth a crooked Shrub call'd <HI>Legnan,</HI> which they bring for <HI>England</HI> as a &s;weet Wood. There are likewi&s;e Apricock, Peach-Trees, and others, which bear twice a year; al&s;o Pear-Trees as preg|nant; Almonds, with a tender Shell; Palms, Plantains, Oranges and Lemons, e&s;pecially the <HI>Paeguada's,</HI> which have &s;mall ones within them, from whence they are &s;o denominated. Al&s;o they have Sugar-Canes, and a little Cotton, <HI>Coloquintida,</HI> &amp;c. The Ro&s;es blow at <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> There are good Carnations, and very large; but no Tulips will grow or thrive there. Samphire clothes the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clover, the Ground. Another Gra&s;s grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, &s;o lu&s;cious and rank, that it will kill a Hor&s;e that eats of it, but no other Bea&s;t. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to &s;pring from one Root, but grows not very high. The Corn of this is tran&s;parent like the pure&s;t yellow Amber, and one Bu&s;hel hath brought forth a hundred in a &s;ea&s;onable Year.</P>

<PB N="740" REF="464">or <HI>Gills,</HI> which the Water hath fretted away in the Mountains, being places very cold.

<P>Bees are carry'd into the Mountains, where they pro&s;per exceedingly. And there they have wild Goats, which climb to the very top of the <HI>Pico</HI> &s;ometimes; al&s;o Hogs, and multitudes of Coneys.</P>
<P>Of Fi&s;h they have the <HI>Cherna,</HI> a very large and excellent Fi&s;h, better ta|&s;ted than any we have in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Mero,</HI> Dolphins, Lob&s;ters, without great Claws, Mu&s;sles, Periwincles, and the <HI>Clacas,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely the very be&s;t Shell-fi&s;h in the world; they grow in the Rocks, five or &s;ix under one great Shell, through the top-holes whereof they peep out with their Nebs; from whence (the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone) they draw them. There is al&s;o another &s;ort of Fi&s;h like an Eel, which hath &s;ix or &s;even Tails of a Span long, united to one Head and Body, which is al&s;o as &s;hort. Be&s;ides, there they have Turtles and <HI>Cabrido's,</HI> which are better than our Trouts.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is full of Springs of fre&s;h Water, ta&s;ting like Milk; which in <HI>Lalagima,</HI> where the Water is not &s;o clear and lympid, they clean&s;e by percola|ting it through a kind of &s;pungy Stone, cut in form of a Ba&s;on.</P>

Concerning the <HI>Guanchio's,</HI> or an|tient Inhabitants, he gave this full account:</P>
<P>The third of <HI>September,</HI> about twelve years &s;ince, he took his Journey from <HI>Guimar,</HI> a Town for the mo&s;t part inhabited by &s;uch as derive them&s;elves from the antient <HI>Guanchio's,</HI> in the Company of &s;ome of them, to view their Caves, and the Corps buried in them, (a favour they &s;eldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their Ance&s;tors in great veneration, and likewi&s;e being extremely again&s;t any mole&s;tation of the Dead) but he had done &s;everal Elee|mo&s;inary Cures among them, for they are very poor (yet the poore&s;t think them&s;elves too good to Marry with the be&s;t <HI>Spaniard</HI>) which endeared him to them exceedingly, otherwi&s;e it is death for any Stranger to vi&s;it the&s;e Caves and Bodies. The Corps are &s;ew'd up in Goat-skins with Thongs of the &s;ame, with very great curio&s;ity, particularly in the incomparable exactne&s;s and even|ne&s;s of the Seams; and the Skins are made very clo&s;e and fit to the Corps; which for the mo&s;t part are entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their Heads, Ears, No&s;e, Teeth, Lips and Beard, all perfect, onely di&s;colour'd, and a little &s;hri|vell'd; likewi&s;e the <HI>Pudenda</HI> of both Sexes. He &s;aw about three or four hundred in &s;everal Caves, &s;ome of them &s;tanding, others lying upon Beds of Wood, &s;o hardned by an Art they had (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Curay,</HI> to cure a piece of Wood,) that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. The&s;e Bodies are very light, as if made of Straw; and in &s;ome broken Bodies be ob&s;erv'd the Nerves and Ten|dons, and al&s;o the String of the Veins and Arteries very di&s;tinctly. By the relation of the mo&s;t antient of this I&s;land, they had a particular Tribe that had this Art onely among them&s;elves, and kept it as a thing &s;acred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar. The&s;e mixt not them&s;elves with the re&s;t of the Inhabitants, nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were al&s;o their Prie&s;ts and Mini&s;ters of Religion. But when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> conquer'd the Place, mo&s;t of them were de&s;troy'd, and the Art peri&s;ht with them; onely they held &s;ome Tra|ditions,
<PB N="741" REF="464">yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this bu&s;ine&s;s; they took But|ter (&s;ome &s;ay they mixed Bears-grea&s;e with it) which they kept for that pur|po&s;e in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, fir&s;t a kind of wild La|vender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks; &s;econdly, an Herb call'd <HI>Lara,</HI> of a very gummy and glutinous con&s;i&s;tence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of <HI>Cyclamen,</HI> or Sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully upon this I&s;land. The&s;e with others, brui&s;ed, and boyl'd up with Butter, rendred it a perfect Bal|&s;om. This prepar'd, they fir&s;t unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer &s;ort, to &s;ave Charges, took out the Brain behind:) after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readine&s;s a <HI>Lixivium</HI> made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith they wa&s;ht the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating very often: Afterward they began their Unction both without and within, drying it as before; this they continu'd till the Bal&s;om had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Mu&s;cle, in all parts appear'd through the contracted Skin, and the Body became exceeding light: then they &s;ew'd them up in the Goat-skins, as was mention'd before.</P>
<P>The Antients &s;ay, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Per&s;onages, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but them&s;elves, and which they will never di&s;cover.</P>
<P>La&s;tly he &s;ays, That Bodies are found in the Caves of the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> in Sacks, quite con&s;umed, and not as the&s;e in <HI>Teneriff.</HI></P>
<P>Antiently, when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, hardned as before mention'd.</P>
<P>They have Earthen Pots, &s;o hard that they cannot be broken: Of the&s;e &s;ome are found in the Caves, and old <HI>Bavances,</HI> and us'd by the poorer People that find them, to boyl Meat in.</P>
<P>Their Food is Barley Parched, and then Ground with little Stone-Mills, and mingled with Milk and Honey, which they always carry with them in Goat-skins at their Backs.</P>
<P>To this day they drink no Wine, nor care for Fle&s;h: they are very ingeni|ous, lean, tall, active, and full of courage; for they will leap from Rock to Rock, from a very prodigious heighth till they come to the bottom, &s;ometimes making ten Fathom deep at one Leap, in this manner: Fir&s;t they <HI>Tertiate</HI> their Lances, which are about the bigne&s;s of a Half-Pike, and aim with the Point at any piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light, &s;ometimes not half a Foot broad; in leaping off they clap their Feet clo&s;e to the Lance, and &s;o carry their Bodies in the Air: the Point of the Lance comes fir&s;t to the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they &s;lide gently down by the Staff, and pitch with their Feet on the very place they fir&s;t de&s;ign'd, and &s;o from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom: But their Novices &s;ometimes break their Necks in the learning.</P>
<P>He told al&s;o (and the &s;ame was &s;eriou&s;ly confirm'd by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and ano|ther <HI>Canary</HI> Merchant there in the Company,) That they Whi&s;tle &s;o loud, as to be heard five Miles off, and that to be in the &s;ame Room with them when they Whi&s;tle, were enough to endanger the breaking of the <HI>Tympanum</HI> of the Ear; and added, That he (being in Company of one that Whi&s;tled his loude&s;t) could not hear perfectly in fifteen days after. He affirms al&s;o, that they throw Stones with a force almo&s;t as great as that of a Bullet; and now u&s;e Stones in all their Fights, as they did antiently. Thus far Mr. <HI>Sprat.</HI></P>

<P>At this day it contains four Wall'd Cities, be&s;ides a great number of Towns; the Cities are, <HI>Valette, Citta Vecchia,</HI> that is, <HI>The Old City,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Old Malta, Biurgo Sante Angelo,</HI> or <HI>The City of Angels,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Citta Victorio&s;a,</HI> and the City or Town of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> or <HI>Sangde.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Valette,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> call'd <HI>Terra Nuova,</HI> and by the <HI>French, Ville Neuve,</HI> gain'd that Name from the Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>Jan de Valette,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Pari&s;ot,</HI> who pre|&s;ently built it after the Siege of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred &s;ixty five, who had then &s;traitned this I&s;land, and taken the Ca&s;tle <HI>St. Elmo,</HI> lying before the City.</P>

The Mar&s;hal, before he had receiv'd the&s;e Orders, had &s;ent a Party of Hor&s;e, under the Conduct of one <HI>Egaras,</HI> to <HI>Mugaro,</HI> to get Intelli|gence, and to entrap one <HI>Turk</HI> or other, in hopes to learn &s;ome News: But this prevented not their coming on, and making further Attempts; whereby, after many flerce A&s;&s;aults made upon the Be&s;iged, with the lo&s;s of many of their Men, the Be&s;ieged at la&s;t were reduc'd to Extremity; when in a lucky Hour, they receiv'd not only Comfort, but fre&s;h Courage, by the coming of <HI>Don Alvaro Garcia,</HI> who after a long &s;tay, provided with a good number of Ships and Soldiers, came in the &s;ight of <HI>Malta</HI> about Noon, on the &s;ixteenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the year Fifteen hundred fifty &s;ix; but kept till the next Break of day about the I&s;land <HI>Comin;</HI> and then he approach'd with his Fleet under <HI>Malta,</HI> by a Place call'd <HI>Melekka,</HI> and Landed all his Aids in le&s;s than an Hours
<PB N="766" REF="481">time; but went back him&s;elf with his Galleys to <HI>Sicily,</HI> with promi&s;e to return again in &s;ix days. Hereupon both the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> gave command to Fire all the Guns again&s;t the Fort, and the I&s;land <HI>Sengle,</HI> and immediately to bring them on Board the Ships; and &s;o pre&s;ently for&s;aking their Trenches, and &s;etting their Huts on fire, &s;ail'd away with their Fleet. The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> arriving at <HI>Galipolis,</HI> made their Adventures known to the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> by Letters, and how that &s;ince their departure from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> they had lo&s;t thirty thou&s;and Seamen and Soldiers together. The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> receiv'd this Letter with &s;o much di&s;content, that he threw it on the ground, and &s;aid with a loud voice, <HI>That his Sword had no luck in another Mans Hand:</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> were receiv'd with &s;igns of great Honor at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with the Beatings of Drums, and Sounding of other In&s;truments.</P>
<P>The Pope al&s;o held a Solemn Proce&s;&s;ion at <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein him&s;elf in Per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted, to thank God for the Pre&s;ervation and Deliverance of <HI>Malta;</HI> and wi&s;h'd the Grand Ma&s;ter, in his Letter to him of the tenth of <HI>October,</HI> much Happine&s;s with his Glorious Victory. The Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>Valette</HI> caus'd by a Collection to be gather'd at <HI>Lyons, Mar&s;eiles, Lovorn, Naples,</HI> and on other Pla|ces, Gunpowder, Saltpetre, Metal for ca&s;ting Guns, all &s;orts of Arms, Ma&s;ts for Shipping, all &s;orts of Nece&s;&s;aries of Wood and Iron, and other needful Things, for the &s;trengthening of the I&s;land. Moreover it was concluded (for the better conveniency of the I&s;land) to build a City on the Mountain <HI>Sceber|ras.</HI> Towards the building of this City, &s;ince call'd <HI>Valette,</HI> thirty thou&s;and <HI>E&s;cues,</HI> or Gold Crowns, were taken up at Intere&s;t by the Order at <HI>Palermo:</HI> The Pope him&s;elf gave to that end five thou&s;and out of his own Pur&s;e, and &s;ent thither a great quantity of Gunpowder and Saltpetre, with a Ma&s;ter-Build|er call'd <HI>Francois Laparel,</HI> and offer'd the Grand Ma&s;ter a Cardinals Cap; but he mode&s;tly refus'd the &s;ame. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> gave towards this Building a Pre&s;ent of thirty thou&s;and <HI>E&s;cues;</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> thirty thou&s;and <HI>Cru|&s;adoes;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, a hundred and forty thou&s;and <HI>Guilders.</HI> Then im|mediately, by the command of the Grand Ma&s;ter, all &s;orts of People were &s;et to work upon the Fortifications, and to &s;cowr and clean&s;e the Ditches and Moats, to which the Knights them&s;elves put their helping hand: And from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>St. Elmo,</HI> where onely before a Ditch had been, there was now a Moat cut in the Rock, down to the Sea.</P>
<P>The Grand Ma&s;ter being brought to the corner of the Bulwark <HI>St. John,</HI> af|ter many Benedictions, and other Ceremonies, laid the fir&s;t Stone of this Ci|ty: Whereupon the Ma&s;ter-Builder <HI>Laparel</HI> ki&s;s'd his hands, and had be&s;tow'd on him a gold Chain with a Medal, which the Grand Ma&s;ter put about his neck. Under this Stone &s;everal Gold, Silver, and Copper Medals were laid, for an everla&s;ting Mark and Remembrance of the Building, whereof the be&s;t had this <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;cription, <HI>Immotam Colli dedit,</HI> that is, <HI>He hath built the City immove|able upon a Rock.</HI> On this fir&s;t Stone Letters were cut, which manife&s;ted the utmo&s;t danger which they endur'd in this Siege, with the Happy Succe&s;s, and their Deliverance; and likewi&s;e the Occa&s;ion and Rea&s;on of this Building, with a Prayer to God, and the Name of the Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>Valette</HI> the Founder. The &s;ame Grand Ma&s;ter pre&s;ented the City likewi&s;e with a Coat of Arms, being upon a Round Scutcheon, a Field <HI>Or,</HI> charg'd with a Lion <HI>Gules:</HI> After which Ceremony, all the Guns round about were Fir'd, and Gold and Silver Money, Coyn'd with the Picture of the Grand Ma&s;ter, thrown among&s;t the People, who all cry'd, <HI>Vive le Grand Valette,</HI> that is, <HI>Long live the Grand Valette.</HI> The
<PB N="767" REF="481">Charges to the Workmen amounted daily to the Sum of fifteen hundred or two thou&s;and Crowns; but to ea&s;e the Payment, and to make good the Char|ges, the Grand Ma&s;ter caus'd Copper Money to be made: One Piece to the value of two <HI>Tarins;</HI> on the one &s;ide, with the Arms of the Order and the Grand Ma&s;ter; and on the other &s;ide, with the Mark or En&s;ign of his Digni|ty, with the&s;e Words about the Border, <HI>Non Aes, &s;ed Fides;</HI> that is, <HI>Not Coyn, but Fidelity.</HI></P>

<P>THis I&s;land (which <HI>Mercator</HI> holds to be the <HI>Co&s;&s;yra</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> but others, the <HI>Pacinia</HI> of the &s;ame Author) lieth between <HI>Sicily</HI> and the Main Land of <HI>Africa;</HI> or between <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> two or three Miles from the City <HI>Mahometa,</HI> right over again&s;t <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> a City in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> in five and thirty Degrees North Latitude, according to <HI>Hues.</HI></P>
<P>It comprehends in Circuit about &s;even or eight Miles, and in breadth three or four. On the Sea-&s;hore, toward the North &s;ide, lieth a City of the &s;ame Name with the I&s;land, Fortified with an unacce&s;&s;ible Ca&s;tle, built upon a &s;teep and pointed Rock.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of it appears Mountainous, full of great Rocks and Cliffs, yielding a glittering black Stone. In the mid&s;t of the I&s;land may be &s;een an <HI>Aby&s;s,</HI> or Bottomle&s;s-pit, call'd <HI>Fo&s;&s;a.</HI> The dryne&s;s of the Soil makes it unca|pable to bring forth Rain: But it affords variety of Pot-herbs, abundance of Cotton, Anni&s;e, Capers, Figs, Melons, and excellent Grapes. There grow al&s;o little Trees, by the <HI>Moors</HI> call'd <HI>Ver;</HI> and by tho&s;e of <HI>Sicily, Sinko;</HI> which bears a round, &s;harp, and red Fruit, but becoming black in ripening, of which the Inhabitants make Oyl, u&s;eful not onely to burn in Lamps, but to eat; wherewith the Women anoint their Heads and Hair, both for Ornament, and to make it grow thicker. There are no Hor&s;es, but Oxen in great numbers, with which they Till the Ground. The&s;e I&s;landers live hardily, and are dexte|rous in Swimming; and although they u&s;e both the <HI>Arabick</HI> Habits and Lan|guage, yet they have approv'd them&s;elves to be good <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
