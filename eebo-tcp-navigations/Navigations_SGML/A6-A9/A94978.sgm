<P>_ON Thur&s;day being the 20 of this in&s;tant July, a Merchants &s;hip la|den with Cloth, and other Com|modities, being bound for Bilbo in Spain, and from thence to the Barbadoes, was to the great grief of many hundreds acciden|taly &s;et on fire, who&s;e violent flames brake &s;o dreadfuly forth, that neither Mariner, Waterman, nor others, could by no means po&s;&s;ible alay or quench the fury and vehe|mency thereof; in&s;omuch, that every man was con&s;trained to look out for deliverance and none dur&s;t at la&s;t attempt a pre&s;ervati|on of the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o that &s;he was expo&s;ed to a de&s;tructive floting, from towards Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|ford to London bridge, where it plea&s;ed di|vine
<PB N="4" REF="3">Providence &s;o to determinate a &s;top to her boundle&s;s way, as to run her upon a &s;helve of &s;and neer unto the bridge, other|wi&s;e tho&s;e &s;tately Fabricks had been indan|gered to have been leveld with the lower|mo&s;t Arches; for no &s;ooner was &s;he &s;trand|ed upon the &s;ands, but immediatly the fire &s;eized on the powder, and thereupon the great blow was given, in which many lo&s;t their lives; for by its mighty violence all the decks were blown up and rent a&s;under, and the main ma&s;t and mi&s;ne ca&s;t up at a great di&s;tance, &s;o that the &s;hip was &s;o di&s;joynt|ed, that &s;undry pieces thereof flew about upon the &s;hore, making great deva&s;tation; and many were &s;lain and hurt; among&s;t the re&s;t, a Gentleman upon London bridge, as he was walking upon his Leades, hads his skul and brains all &s;hattered to pieces: O|thers had their Head, Legs, and Arms ta|ken
<PB N="5" REF="3">off, and many &s;acrificed their lives in the flames, who&s;e names are &s;aid to be as foloweth:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Mr. John Thorowgood,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Leonard Ma&s;on,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Thomas Atkin&s;on,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Peter Ward,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And James Anderton.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the hou&s;es were mo&s;t pitifully rent and torn, and &s;o great a &s;hrieking of men, women, and children, that the like hath not been heard in many Ages.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which &s;ad accident, the like danger by fire could not be prevented on Fryday the 21 in&s;tant; but about nine of the clock in the forenoon, another &s;hip laden with Oyles, and other Commodities, lying at Fre&s;h-Wharf was likewi&s;e &s;uddenly blown up, the manner thus:</P>
<P>The &s;hip being unlading, and a Merchants man going down with &s;ome of the Mariners into the lower Hold to look for &s;ome Goods, it &s;o accident|ally hapned, that the &s;nuff of a Candle falling, took
<PB N="6" REF="4">hold of the Gunpowder, and blew up certain Par|rels, which carryed away the whole &s;teerage, Gun|room, and Ma&s;ters Cabin, and the force of the blow did likewi&s;e &s;plit the Keel, &s;o that the &s;hip was im|mediatly fill'd with water, and great skreekings and doleful cryes there were a&s;hore, &s;ome having their Arms al&s;o taken off: Others, their Legs, Heads, and other parts of their bodies &s;orely brui&s;ed &amp; brake; but that which &s;eems the mo&s;t dreadfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, is, that a Gentlemans maid holding a little Child in her arms, about a twelve-month old, upon the Wharf &s;ide, received &s;everal wounds by &s;plinters, and the poor Infant was blown from her, and never yet could be heard of.</P>
<P>Nay more, the terrour of the blow extended &s;o far, that above 40 per&s;ons were expo&s;ed to great mi&s;ery, and are now made objects of pity and com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet thus much is ob&s;ervable, that when the blow was given, the windows &s;hatter'd to pieces, and the hou&s;es rent and torn, that two birds in their Cages, hanging neer, &amp; oppo&s;ite again&s;t the Crane, where the blow had its greate&s;t force, were both pre&s;erved &s;afe, and not &s;o much as a feather hurt.</P>
<P>The number of tho&s;e killed in this &s;hip are &s;aid
<PB N="7" REF="4">to be nine, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Gunner,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Gunners Mate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A P&s;alters man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Bo&s;tons Mate,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Carpenter,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Steward,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And three more.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Great was the lo&s;s likewi&s;e the day before, for di|vers were wounded as they pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge, yet (ble&s;&s;ed be God) not a man hurt in the &s;hip, for &s;o &s;oon as they perceived her a fire, the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ptain lea|ped out into the Thames, and &s;wum for his life; the like did all the re&s;t; who got cleer off, except the Gunners wife, who being newly come aboard, and a&s;toni&s;h'd at the fire, ran skreeking up and down the &s;hip for her husband, in&s;omuch that the flames caught hold of her head-cloths, &s;inged her hair, and &s;corched her face, but did her no other harm.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s is exceeding great, and perilous to ma|ny; but &s;o much the greater, by rea&s;on of the ta|king off many Gentlemen; among&s;t the re&s;t, Mr. Fulner a Drapier upon London-bridge, coming to
<PB N="8" REF="5">his Neighbors hou&s;e, to help get off certain goods, and to carry them at a further di&s;tance, by rea&s;on they feared the firing of that end of the bridge, at|tempted (with two other Gentlemen) to go up into a Gallery, to di&s;cover how neer the &s;hip was, who immediatly thereupon &s;triking upon the &s;ands, the blow was given, and the &s;hip blown up, who&s;e &s;plinters flew with &s;uch vehemency, that a piece of his head was taken off, and his brains da&s;ht again&s;t the walls: the other two Gentlemen were both hurt, but not mortal: be&s;ides divers that were in boats, and other places; to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of many hundreds. But tis hoped that care will be taken for the future to prevent the&s;e &s;ad accidents; and the rather, becau&s;e there is a great &s;u&s;pition of &s;ome de&s;perate Con&s;piracie agitating by the Por|tuglals; and that for this cau&s;e: That on Fryday la&s;t towards the Evening at Hor&s;ey-down, a Gen|tleman was apprehended, who had divers Fire|works about him; But upon examination, he was committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody.</P>
