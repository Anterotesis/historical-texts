<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t, I &s;ent you a printed Paper, intituled <HI>Londons Choice of Citizens,</HI> &amp;c. which I could te&s;tifie to the truth of in almo&s;t all the particulars: And therefore I forbore to give it you in writing. But there having pa&s;s'd in publick &s;ince that, &s;omewhat which may &s;eem to im|peach the Certainty of that Relation in point of the Cities affection to the D. of <HI>Y</HI>'s. Intere&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> thought good to give you &s;uch an account of that Affair, as my Occa&s;ions and Opportunities <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll give me leave to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>You may wonder indeed that, (after the Citizens by their Addre&s;&s;es to the Lord Maior, for in|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">a&s;ing the City-Guards, in re&s;pect of the greater danger by the D's pre&s;ence at Court; and their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> publick and unanimous owning of their former Choice of Par-liament-men, and in them the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">l of Exclu&s;ion of the D. pa&s;s'd by the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in Parliament,) you may wonder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay) that the Artillery-Company, which contains about 700 Citizens and others, &s;hould invite <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">e D. to &s;uch a publick Entertainment, which bears the face of great Re&s;pect and Honour: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hen you are acquainted with the Rea&s;on and Manner of it, you will &s;ee no Incon&s;i&s;tency in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">ings, nor Mutability in the minds of the Citizens.</P>
<P>You may plea&s;e to know, that &s;ome years ago the D. of <HI>Y.</HI> was cho&s;en to be Chief Leader or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">ptain of this Company, and with him many Lords and Courtiers were admitted members of it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> that if we may judge by the choice of Stewards, both the la&s;t Year, and for the Year en&s;uing, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">e may perceive as many great Courtiers as Citizens to have place in it. For the la&s;t year the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">ewards are named to us to have been, the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> Coll. <HI>Legg,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Robert Holmes,</HI> of the Court; of the City, Sir <HI>John Chapman,</HI> Sir <HI>Rich. How,</HI> Maj. <HI>Horn,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">pt. <HI>Hud&s;on.</HI> Now the Stewards bearing all the Extraordinary Charge, it is at ther liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">rite whom they plea&s;e: How then could it be imagin'd that the&s;e, who are half of them Cour|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs, and the other half Courtly Citizens, &s;hould omit any &s;uch thing as might tend to the Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">tation of the D's. Intere&s;t, as they hoped this would prove: And for the &s;ame cau&s;e the D. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">uld not but accept of the Invitation. Nay, it is commonly &s;aid, he gave 200 <HI>l.</HI> towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">a&s;t. He was attended with his Troop of Guards, and pa&s;s'd coming and going through the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">blick Streets to and from <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall,</HI> where they Dined; whither his R. H. came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s we are told in the <HI>Gazette</HI>) about an hour before the Artillery-men. For it is u&s;ual on the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cca&s;ions to have Prayers and a Sermon, which was perform'd at <HI>Bowe-Church</HI> in <HI>Cheap-&s;ide;</HI> to which place they marched from their Rendezvous at <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> about Eighty or Ninety men. Their Preacher was a per&s;on who&s;e Anti-Engli&s;h Principles are well enough known by his printed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ermons; in one of which Preached in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, he falls foul upon a great man for declaring, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the King is King by Law;</HI> and concerning the di&s;mal Fires which were before that time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">early di&s;cover'd to be effected by Papi&s;ts, this Preacher a&s;&s;igns them (as <HI>Langhorn</HI> once) to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">dgements of God upon us; and &s;o he may the Sufferings of the Martyrs in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>The Sermon ended, they marched from Church to Dinner; fir&s;t the Stewards, then the Lord Maior, and Nine or Ten Aldermen, not the Court of Aldermen, as the <HI>Gazetteer</HI> is plea&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ell us; for they require Thirteen to make a <HI>Quorum,</HI> and their Number is Twenty four: Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters">e re&s;t in their order, which in all, Captains and other Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, with Serjeants, Corporals, Mar&s;hals, and other common men being reckon'd, amounted (as I am inform'd) to One hundred twenty eight. Not but that &s;ome hundreds of other Citizens of this Company had paid the u&s;ual Ticket-money (which is 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>) and taken Tickets for admittance; but not being willing to give the countenance of their pre&s;ence to that Entertainment, when they under|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tood the D. was there; &s;ome made no u&s;e of their Tickets, &s;ome tore them to pieces, &s;ome gave them to their Porters, or other mean men, that they apparel'd in their Holiday Cloaths might be admitted to fea&s;t with the D. But others &s;old them for 12 <HI>d.</HI> or 6 <HI>d.</HI> apiece, as they could meet with per&s;ons who&s;e curio&s;ity led them to behold the manner of that A&s;&s;embly, and take part of their Cheer; with &s;uch Gue&s;ts as the&s;e they furni&s;ht their Tables. Thus indeed the Entertainment might be great, becau&s;e the Company was little: And it might be &s;plendid too in the Eyes of &s;uch as never were at the like before. But it is not to be doubted but the Noble Stewards (e&s;pecially if a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the D's. Pur&s;e) would make the Entertainment &s;uitable to the de&s;ign they had in the Invitation.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>After Dinner, we are told, his R. H. return'd to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> leaving the Company ex|treamly plea&s;ed with the Honour he had done them. <HI>Honor e&s;t in honorante,</HI> is u&s;ually &s;aid but if I dur&s;t pre&s;ume to give my Judgement in this ca&s;e, I &s;hould determine that his R. H. ra+ther was extreamly pleas'd with the Honour they had done him: For certainly he cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> re&s;ent it kindly, that &s;ome Citizens &s;hould be made to &s;eem to treat him with Honour in th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> City, whom the late Commons in Parliament thought worthy to be treated much otherwi&s;e. This Entertainment was (I doubt not) de&s;ign'd to retrieve a little in the Eye of the Nation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Reputation the <HI>York</HI>-Intere&s;t lo&s;t in the late Choice of Parliament-men; and it may perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> with tho&s;e that look no further than the <HI>Gazzette</HI> for Intelligence; but whether it will do &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> no with tho&s;e that acquaint them&s;elves with the true Circum&s;tances of things, I leave you to judge.</P>
<P>I need not take notice of what the <HI>Dome&s;tick Intelligence</HI> tells you, that among other Health<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> they drank one to the happy Succe&s;&s;ion in the Right Line; for it's reported they drank &s;o ma|ny Healths, that one of the Grave City Sirs lo&s;t his Beaver-Hat and Golden Hat-band, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the greater Company to &s;port with the Foot-boyes; nor of the D's. Promi&s;e to defend the Re|ligion e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if indeed he made any &s;uch Promi&s;e; for no man can think, but that he who is obliged by the Principles and Articles of his Church, un|der the Penalties of Excommunication, and con&s;equently Damnation in the world to come; and of Depo&s;ition from and Deprivation of his Crowns and Dignities, with the danger of his Life by Stab, Pi&s;toll, Poy&s;on, Warr or otherwi&s;e, in this World; to extirpate and de&s;troy all He|reticks; I &s;ay it cannot be imagin'd but a Je&s;uited Papi&s;t will prove an excellent Defender of the Religion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law; &s;ince all the Members of our Church are every year &s;olemnly condemn'd for Hereticks by the Pope. And why &s;hould we doubt, &s;ince he has given his word for it to the <HI>Artillery-men,</HI> but he will Govern according to Law, and &s;ecure to us all the Immunities, Rights and Defences that our Laws give us, when he comes to be Supreme; &s;ince he is not now capable of bearing of any Office or Tru&s;t in the Govern|ment what&s;oever, being excluded therefrom for the nece&s;&s;ary Pre&s;ervation of the Government and Religion.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit to tell you what happened in the D's. return thorow the <HI>Poultrey.</HI> For there in pa&s;&s;ing through the many Hundreds of Beholders, a Cry aro&s;e, <HI>No Pope, no Pope; No Papi&s;t, no Papi&s;t;</HI> this attended him up into <HI>Cheap&s;ide;</HI> as in the Morning at his coming within <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> the People began to Hi&s;s, and utter their di&s;ta&s;te.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee by this, how little they gain'd by their project of a publick Entertainment, which indeed was no more an Act of the City, than if the Stewards of one of the Forty eight Companies had invited the D. and of that Company a &s;ixth or &s;eventh part only had appear'd: which is another happy demon&s;tration of the con&s;tant Affection of the Citizens to their Reli|gion and Government, and Aver&s;ation to Popery.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a very faithful Account of this Tran&s;action, &s;o far as it is come within my know|ledge. I doubt not of your taking it in good part, and for an Evidence that I am,</P>
