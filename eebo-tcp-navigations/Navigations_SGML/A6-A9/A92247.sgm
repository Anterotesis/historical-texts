<HEAD>REASONS <HI>Humbly Offered for Continuing the Right of Foreign-Built Ships, now belonging to Engli&s;h Owners, to Load at and from any of the Plantations for</HI> England <HI>directly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Intent of the Bill for Preventing Abu&s;es Committed to the prejudice of the Plantation-Trade, particularly by the <HI>Scotch,</HI> and to hinder the Trading in Foreign-Built Ships from Port to Port, and from one Colony to ano|ther in the Plantations, being now before your Lord&s;hips,</P>
<P>It is Humbly propo&s;ed to your Lord&s;hip's Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the pre&s;ent War hath very much decrea&s;ed the Shipping of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e Employed in the Plantation-Trade, &s;o many having been Taken, and Lo&s;t. The Con&s;equences of the War have made all Materials for Building Ships very dear, and the Great Occa&s;ion the King hath for Shipwrights, makes Building not only very Charge|able, but al&s;o Dilatory, for want of Ship-Carpenters, and altogether a great di&s;couragement to Build many Ships during the War.</P>
<P N="2">II. That Foreign-Built Ships, Called Engli&s;h Shipping, as belong|ing <HI>Bona Fide</HI> wholly to Engli&s;h Owners, and Bought for Valuable Con&s;iderations, and Navigated with the Ma&s;ter and three fourths Engli&s;h Seamen, are not even in Times of Peace Excluded by the Act of Navigation, nor by the Act of Frauds, from going to the Plantations to load there for <HI>England</HI> directly, Paying Aliens Cu&s;toms if not made Free.</P>
<P N="3">III. That during this War, there hath been a want of Shipping to bring off the Yearly Product of the Plantations, the Natural Con&s;e|quences whereof are High Freights, and few Goods, and tho&s;e Sold Dear here, and but little left to be Exported to Foreign Markets, for the want whereof we &s;uffer &s;o much in the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and are forc'd to &s;end out the more Mony.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the Engli&s;h Merchants and Traders in this Kingdom be|ing no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> debar'd by the &s;aid Acts of Navigation and Frauds to Trade with Foreign-Built Ships, under the Conditions therein mentioned, have always been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch Ships, whereby the Cu&s;toms as well as the Trade have been Increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>'Tis therefore Humbly Hoped that &s;uch Provi&s;ion may be made in the &s;aid Bill, as may Pre&s;erve the Right and Property of the Subjects to continue &s;uch Foreign-Built Ships in the Plantation-Trade as be|fore this time they are Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and Owners of. Provided they do not Trade from Port to Port in the Plantations, nor from one Colony to another.</HI></P>
