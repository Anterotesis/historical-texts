<P>O Ye Eternal and ble&s;&s;ed Ones, who&s;e dwelling is on high, in the fulne&s;s of all Beauty and Brightne&s;s, Glory, and everla&s;ting Joy, Happine&s;s and Peace for evermore; We who are poor Sufferers for the Seed of God, in the Covenant of Light, Life and Truth, do dearly &s;alute and imbrace you all, according to our mea&s;ures, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Honour and Glo|ry be given to our Lord God for ever, of all who know him, who hath counted us worthy, and hath cho&s;en us among his faithful Ones, to bear his Name, and to witne&s;s forth his Truth, before the High

<P>The Lord did give us a pro&s;perous Journey hither, and when we came to <HI>Legorn,</HI> we were refre&s;hed with Friends [who were there before us] and they did get a pa&s;&s;age for us (and lodging) but as &s;oon as we heard of the Ve&s;&s;el, we did feel our Service. So we went into the City in the living Power of the Lord, and there were many tender hearts did vi&s;it us, to their comfort, and our joy: The little time we &s;taid there, we gave &s;ome of our Books and one Paper: &s;o journying towards <HI>A|lexandria,</HI> the Captain told us that <HI>Malta</HI> was in the way, and he mu&s;t put in there a &s;mall time.

<P>The Engli&s;h Con&s;ul came aboard the Ship (as the Captain &s;aid) but we did not &s;ee him, and invited us to his Hou&s;e, it was the &s;eventh, or la&s;t day of the week.

<P>Two dayes after they came again, and called for me, and offered me the Crucifix,

<P>And they asked me, <HI>What I would do at Jeru&s;alem?</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>I</HI> did not know that I &s;hould go there, but I &s;hould go to <HI>Alex|andria;</HI> and they &s;aid, <HI>What to do?</HI> and I &s;aid, to do the Will of God; and if the Lord did open my mouth, I &s;hould call them to Repentance, and declare to them the day of the Lord, and direct their minds from darkne&s;s to Light.</P>
<P>Then they asked me, <HI>Whether I did tremble when I did preach?</HI> And I told them, I did tremble when the power of

<P>That day that we were had from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;uls to the Inqui&s;ition, the Con|&s;uls Wife brought us meat to eat, and as &s;he pa&s;t by me, I was &s;mote with an Arrow to the heart, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eard a voice, &s;aying, <HI>It is fini&s;hed, &s;he hath obtained her purpo&s;e.</HI> I did not ta&s;te of her meat, but went a&s;ide and wept bitterly. The Con&s;ul did affirm to us the night before, that there was no &s;uch thing, (as to en&s;nare us) intended; but it was in us as fire, and our &s;ouls were heavy even unto death; for many dayes before we &s;aw in a Vi&s;ion of our going there, (to pri&s;on) and we &s;aid, <HI>Pilate</HI> would do the <HI>Jews</HI> a plea&s;ure, and wa&s;h his hands in innocency.

Then he &s;aid, <HI>If we would change our minds, and do as they would have us to do, we &s;hould &s;ay &s;o, or el&s;e they would u&s;e us as they plea&s;ed.</HI> We &s;aid, the Will of the Lord be done. And he aro&s;e up and went his way with the Con&s;ul, and left us there. And the man with the black Rod, and the Keeper, took us and put us into an inner room in the Inqui&s;ition, which had but two little holes in it for light or air; but the glory of the Lord did &s;hine round about us.</P>
<P>After the Con&s;ul came with tears in his eyes, and &s;aid, <HI>he was as &s;orry as for his own fle&s;h, but there was &s;ome hopes in time;</HI> and &s;o he went away, but never had peace while he lived. He would have given up the thirty pieces of &s;ilver again, but it

<P>The next &s;econd day came a Magi&s;trate, two Friars, &amp; the man with the black Rod, and a Scribe, and the Keeper to the Inqui|&s;ition, to &s;it upon Judgement, and examin|ed us apart, conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rning our faith in Chri&s;t.

He asked, <HI>if we would &s;peak Truth?</HI> We &s;aid, Yea. He asked, <HI>Whether we did be|lieve the Creed?</HI> We &s;aid, we did believe in God, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;uffered at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> under <HI>Pilate,</HI> and aro&s;e again from the dead the third day, and a&s;cended to his Father, and &s;hall come to judge|ment, to judge both quick and dead.

He asked, <HI>If we believed a Purgatory?</HI> We &s;aid, No; but a Heaven and a Hell. The Friar &s;aid, <HI>We were commanded to pray for the dead; for tho&s;e that were in Heaven had no need, and they that were in Hell, there is no redemption; therefore there mu&s;t be a Purgatory.</HI> He ask|ed, <HI>If we believed their holy Sacrament?</HI> We &s;aid, we never read the Word <HI>Sacra|ment</HI> in Scripture. The Friar replyed, <HI>Where we did read in our Bibles,</HI> Sanctifica|tion, <HI>it was</HI> Sacrament <HI>in theirs.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Their holy Sacrament was Bread and Wine, which they converted into the Fle&s;h and Blood of Chri&s;t, by the virtue of Chri&s;t.</HI> We &s;aid, they did work Miracles then, for Chri&s;t's virtue is the &s;ame as it was when he turn|ed Water into Wine, at the Marriage in <HI>Canaan.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>If we did not eat the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;h, and drink the Blood of the Son of God, we had no Life in us.</HI> We &s;aid, the Fle&s;h and Blood of Chri&s;t is &s;piritual, and we do feed upon it daily; for that which is begotten of God in us, can no more live without &s;pi|ritual food, than our temporal bodies can

The Friar &s;aid, <HI>We were deceived, and had not the faith: but we have all virtues.</HI> We &s;aid, that faith was the ground from whence virtues do pro|ceed. They &s;aid, <HI>If we would take their ho|ly Sacrament, we might have our liberty; or el&s;e the Pope would not leave us for millions of Gold, but we &s;hould lo&s;e our &s;ouls and our bo|dies too.</HI> We &s;aid, the Lord had provided for our &s;ouls, and our bodies were free|ly given up to &s;erve the Lord.

They brought us that Scripture, <HI>Who&s;e &s;ins ye re|mit in earth, &s;hall be remitted in heaven.</HI> We &s;aid, all Power was Gods, &amp; he could give it to whom he would (that were born of the eternal Spirit, and guided by the &s;ame; &s;uch have power to do the Fathers Will, as I an|&s;wered a Friar al&s;o in the City of <HI>Naples</HI>) and they were &s;ilent, the Power greatly working. We asked them wherein we had wronged them, that we &s;hould be kept Pri&s;oners all days of our lives; and &s;aid, Our innocent blood would be required at their hands.</P>
<P>The Friar &s;aid, <HI>He would take our blood upon him, and our journey into Turky too.</HI> We told him, the time would come he would find he had enough upon him without it. They &s;aid, <HI>The Pope was Chri&s;t's Vicar, and we were of his Church, and what he did, was for the good of our Souls.</HI> We an&s;wered, The Lord had not committed the charge of our &s;ouls to the Pope, nor to them; for he had taken them into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, glory was to his Name for ever. They &s;aid, <HI>We mu&s;t be obedient.</HI> We &s;aid, we were obe|dient to the government of Chri&s;ts Spirit. The Friar &s;aid, <HI>None had the true Light

<P>We &s;aid, Wo to him that calleth <HI>Je&s;us</HI> accur&s;ed: Can the Devil give power over &s;in and iniquity? then he would de&s;troy his own kingdom.

He &s;aid, <HI>We did run about to preach, and had not the true Faith.</HI> We &s;aid the true Faith is held in a pure Con&s;cience void of offence towards God and man; and we had the true Faith. And he &s;aid, <HI>There was but one Faith, either theirs, or ours;</HI> and ask'd us <HI>which it was?</HI> We &s;aid, Every one had the true Faith, that did believe in God, and in Je&s;us whom he had &s;ent; but they that &s;ay they do believe, and do not keep his Commandments, are lyars, and the truth is not in them. He &s;aid <HI>it was true:</HI> but he did thir&s;t daily for our blood, becau&s;e we would not turn, and urged us much about our Faith and Sacrament, to bring us under their Law; but the Lord pre&s;erved us.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, <HI>It was impo&s;&s;ible we could live long in that hot room.</HI> So the next week-day they &s;ate in Council; but, Oh how the &s;welling Sea did rage, and the proud waves

They &s;aid, <HI>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, &s;hould never go back again.</HI> We &s;aid, the Lord was as &s;ufficient for us, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and our tru&s;t was in God. They &s;aid, <HI>we were but few, and had been but a little while, but they

<P>But three nights after the Lord &s;aid un|to me, about the eleventh hour, <HI>Ari&s;e, and put on your clothes.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>When wilt thou come, Lord?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>VVhether at midnight, or at Cock-crow, do thou watch.</HI> My Friend and I aro&s;e, and the Lord &s;aid, <HI>Go, &s;tand at the Door.</HI> And we &s;tood at the door in the Power of the Lord, I did &s;carce know whether I was in the body, or out of the body. And about the twelfth hour there came many to the Pri&s;on-Gate: We heard the Keyes, and looked when they would come in. They

<P>The tenth day of my fa&s;t there came <HI>two Fryars,</HI> the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> the man with the <HI>black Rod,</HI> and a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and the <HI>Keeper;</HI> and the <HI>Friar</HI> commanded my dear Friend to go out of the room, and he came and pull'd my hand out of the bed, and &s;aid, <HI>Is the Devil &s;o great in you, that you cannot &s;peak?</HI> I &s;aid, Depart from me thou worker of iniquity, I know thee not; the Power of the Lord is upon me, and thou calle&s;t him Devil. He took his Crucifix to &s;trike me in the mouth; and I &s;aid, Look here! and I asked him, Whether it were that Cro&s;s which crucified <HI>Paul</HI> to the World, and the World unto him? And he &s;aid, <HI>it was.</HI> I denied him, and &s;aid, the Lord had made me a Witne&s;s for him&s;elf again&s;t all workers of iniquity. <HI>He bid me be obedient,</HI> and went to &s;trike me. I &s;aid, Wilt thou &s;trike me? He &s;aid, <HI>he would.</HI> I &s;aid, Thou art out of the Apo|&s;tles Doctrine, they were no &s;trikers; I

He &s;aid, <HI>I &s;hould be whipt, and quartered, and burnt that night in</HI> Malta, <HI>and my Mate too: wherefore did we come to teach them?</HI> I told him I did not fear, the Lord was on our &s;ide, and he had no power but what he had received and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e did not u&s;e it to the &s;ame end the Lord gave it him, the Lord would judge him.

<P>And as &s;oon as they were gone, the Lord &s;aid unto me, <HI>The la&s;t Enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed, is Death;</HI> and the Life aro&s;e over Death, and I glorified God.

<P>Afterwards the Friar came again with his Phy&s;ician; I told him, that I could not take any thing, unle&s;s I was moved of the Lord.

<P>And he asked&punc; <HI>if I did not think it expe|dient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the &s;ick?</HI> I &s;aid, Yea, &s;uch as were eternal|ly moved of the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e Lord.

<P>The la&s;t day of my Fa&s;t I began to be an hungry, but was afraid to eat, the Enemy was &s;o &s;trong; but the Lord &s;aid unto me, <HI>If thine Enemy hunger, f&eacute;ed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink: in &s;o doing thou &s;halt heap coals of fire upon his head.

Then he &s;aid, <HI>We had &s;uffer|ed long enough, and too long, but we &s;hould have our freedom in few days, and that they would &s;end to the Pope for an Order.</HI> And there were many Engli&s;h Ships that way; but the Captain &s;aw it was a very hard thing, &s;o that it grieved him to the heart: He prayed God to comfort us, and he went away, and we do be&s;eech God to ble&s;s and pre&s;erve him, unto everla&s;ting Life, and never to let him nor his, go without a ble&s;|&s;ing from him, for his love: he did venture him&s;elf exceedingly in that place. But af|ter he was gone, they aro&s;e up again&s;t us with one accord: The Inqui&s;itor came up into a Tower, and lookt down upon us as if he would have eaten us, and they did try us for our lives again, and did &s;hut up our doors many Weeks, we could not
<PB N="59" REF="41"> tell for what; at length the Inqui&s;itor came into the Tower again, and <HI>Sarah</HI> was moved to call to him, to have the door opened for us to go down into the Court to wa&s;h our clothes. Then he gave command for the door to be opened once a week; and in a little while 'twas open ever day. But great was our affliction indeed; and &s;he told him if we were the Popes Pri&s;on|ers, we would appeal to the Pope, and he &s;hould &s;end us to him. But them in the Pri&s;on with us, e&s;pecially the Friar, were mortal Enemies to us, but yet they would have fed us with the choice&s;t of their meat, and would gladly give us whole Bottels of wine, if we would receive it, and were greatly troubled becau&s;e we did re|fu&s;e to eat and drink with them, and did per&s;ecute us exceedingly; but the Lord did vi&s;it them with his dreadful Judge|ments, the Friar was tormented night and day, his body did peri&s;h, the Doctors and Chyrurgeons did follow him a long time.</P>
<P>And there were two or three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships there, came into harbour, and <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;aw the coming of them in a Vi&s;ion of the night, and there was great pleading for us, that we &s;aw; but &s;he heard a Voice, &s;aying, <HI>We could not go now.</HI> So we were mad:
<PB N="60" REF="42" MS="y"> willing to wait the Lords time.</P>
<P>Then they &s;ent for us forth when the Ships were gone, and askt us, <HI>If we would be Catholicks?</HI> And we &s;aid, we were true Chri&s;tians, and had received the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and he that had not the Spirit of Chri&s;t was none of his. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con|&s;ul told us of the Ships, and &s;aid, <HI>They would not let us go unle&s;s we would be Catho|licks; and that we mu&s;t &s;uffer more impri|&s;onment yet,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>he did what he could for us.</HI> One of the Magi&s;trates &s;hewed us the Cro&s;s; We told them, and &s;aid, We did take up the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t daily, which is the great Power of God to crucifie &s;in and iniquity: &s;o we told them that one of their <HI>Fathers</HI> did promi&s;e us our liberty. We did think that Friar was too tender-hearted to &s;tay among them; he did take a great deal of pains for us (the Captain &s;aid) We told him, he would never have cau&s;e to repent it; the ble&s;&s;ing of God would be upon him for any thing he &s;hould do for us; for we were the Servants of the living God; and he promi&s;ed us our freedoms in a little time.</P>

<HEAD>A Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>IN a Vi&s;ion of the night, I &s;aw in the Fir|mament &s;ix Suns; one at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t, that did appear to be but half an hour high; the other five &s;tood four-&s;quare, one in the middle; and they did cro&s;s over each other; the highe&s;t did not &s;eem to be above an hour high. And when I did awake, I was troubled in my &s;pirit to know the Vi&s;ion; and I waited upon the Lord, and he &s;ignified to me in the Light, The &s;ix Suns were &s;ix Nations, who&s;e Lights were near out; and the five which cro&s;&s;ed each other, &s;ignified to me &s;ome ri&s;ing among&s;t them.</P>
<P>And the Friar came to me, and &s;aid, <HI>It was God's will we &s;hould be kept there, or el&s;e they could not keep us. I</HI> told him, the Lord did &s;uffer wicked men to do wicked|ly, but did not will them to do it. He did &s;uffer <HI>Herod</HI> to take off <HI>John Bapti&s;t's</HI> head, but he did not will him to do it: and did &s;uffer <HI>Stephen</HI> to be &s;toned, and <HI>Judas</HI> to betray Chri&s;t, but he did not will them to

<P>The Friar would &s;ay &s;till, <HI>We had not the true Faith.</HI> We &s;aid, By Faith we &s;tand, and by the Power of God we are upholden; do&s;t thou think it is by our own power and holine&s;s we are kept from a vain conver|&s;ation, from &s;in and wickedne&s;s?

<P>Now the Lord &s;aid, <HI>Fear not Daughters of</HI> Sion, <HI>I will carry you forth as Gold tryed in the fire.</HI> And many precious Pro|mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es did the Lord refre&s;h us with in our greate&s;t extremity, and would appear in his Glory, that our &s;ouls would be ravi&s;hed in his pre&s;ence.

<P>The next time he came to me, he came in Sheeps clothing, but he had a Wolf un|der his Gown; he gave me words as &s;oft

<P>And we were parted One Year, but great was the Work of the Lord, and great was the Power to carry it on.

<P>Oh! the goodne&s;s of the Lord, and his long-&s;uffering and forbearance, vvhich would lead them to Repentance; but they would not hearken to his Coun&s;el, but turned his Laws behind their backs, and hated to be in&s;tructed by them; therefore the Lord did laugh at their de&s;truction, and did mock when their fear came: Their wickedne&s;s was &s;o great, and my burthen &s;o heavy to bear it, that I cryed to the Lord, and &s;aid, It is better for me to die, than to live: and would gladly have given up my life in te&s;timony again&s;t them all; I was (as 'twere) compelled to declare again&s;t all their Wayes, Works and Wor|&s;hips, in&s;omuch that they ran to the Inqui|&s;itor to have me chained, or puni&s;h'd &s;ome other way; but the Power of the Lord

<P>I cannot expre&s;s the large Love of our God, how he did pre&s;erve us from &s;o many Deaths and Threatnings, as they did come to me with, falling down upon their knees, &s;aying Ma&s;s, and would have me to &s;ay af|ter them; but in the Name of the Lord I denyed them.

<P>DEar Lambs, Peace be unto you, <HI>Amen.</HI> Now &s;eeing that the Everla&s;ting God and Father of all Truth, hath in his tender love, fatherly mercy, and bowels of compa&s;&s;ion (through the tryals of ma|nifold &s;ufferings and temptations) hither|to, even to this day, upheld and pre&s;erved you in the Innocency, and its Te&s;timony again&s;t the contrary; although &s;ometimes (I know that) you have ta&s;ted the &s;entence of death in your &s;elves, and even (as it were) ready to de&s;pair of life; yet in the living Te&s;timony of Innocency, in the an|&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience, I <HI>Daniel,</HI> bear you Record in the Covenant of Life, the &s;ame remaineth with you, and you are in it a good &s;weet &s;avour to the Lord, and his Eternal Truth and People.

<P>Oh! I am moved in the Bowels of my Father's Love, as one with you (in tryals, and the exerci&s;e of manifold temptations) to &s;tir up your pure and innocent minds by way of remembrance, and al&s;o to be&s;eech you to take heed to the Te&s;timony of Life that's undefiled, and manife&s;t in you, and to dwell in the &s;ame which retains the Joy and Comfort of the Lord, and his Peace, which you know is not of the World; and &s;o to watch and beware of the Enemy that is near to tempt to make &s;hipwrack of Faith and a good Con&s;cience, and to di&s;|pair, and &s;o to betray not only your own innocent long-&s;ufferings, but al&s;o the Te|&s;timony of the Lord God of our Life, for which you have &s;o long &s;uffered, and by the pure Divine Vertue of the &s;ame have you been to this day pre&s;erved; &s;o that the Lord (who is and will be your reward) hath not been wanting to you on his part.

<P>ANd when this, with other Papers, I had (through not a little difficulty) communicated to their hands over the heads of our Enemies, I was moved to &s;peak my Me&s;&s;age, as from the Lord of Life, to them, after I had offered up my body, and to lay down my Life for the&s;e poor Innocents, my dear Friends; and &s;o with my voice I &s;aluted them in the Lord's Truth, as they &s;tood at the Pri&s;on-Grates, with the&s;e words, in the behalf of the ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of the Saints in light, to
<PB N="130" REF="77"> wit, <HI>The whole Body of God's Elect, right dearly, owneth your Te&s;timony, and you are a &s;weet &s;avour unto the Lord and his people:</HI> And fora&s;much as one of the&s;e poor affli|cted Lambs replied, and &s;aid on this wi&s;e, as if it was a trouble to them that they could not be more &s;erviceable. Then my heart being melted, and my bowels of pi|ty, mercy and compa&s;&s;ion, being moved, I &s;aid, That it was a wonderful mercy of the Lord, in as much as they were pre&s;er|ved in their own mea&s;ure of Truth, and pure Innocency, for which my heart prai|&s;ed the Lord for what mine eye &s;aw, which right dearly affected my heart; and we were well refre&s;hed at that &s;ea&s;on, in the &s;weet pre&s;ence of our living God, albeit, our bodies were at a di&s;tance, but &s;o as we could behold each others face through the Pri&s;on bars of Iron, in the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Now for &s;o much as in the Wi&s;dom of God it is &s;een meet, that the fore-mentio|ned and following Writings which came from their hands, might appear to publick view, that thereby every Member of the one Body may have a right under&s;tanding; and not only &s;o, but al&s;o a &s;en&s;ible feeling,
<PB N="131" REF="77"> not only of the tryals &amp; &s;ufferings in part of the&s;e innocent Lambs, but al&s;o, of the Con&s;olations of each other, as fellow-Members of the infinite Body of which Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord is both King and Head; in whom be endle&s;s dominion and pure glory, and eternal &s;alvation, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o I being as it were con&s;trained to publi&s;h the acceptable Words, that &s;ound and &s;avor of pure innocency and clear truth, for the Elect's &s;ake; in the &s;ame Love and Life I am the more free hereun|to, even as a Child, that differs but little from a &s;ervant, as I am in the Fathers Love, Power and Grace of Life, fitted to &s;erve the undefiled Life of the lea&s;t in the Kingdom of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and to admini|&s;ter comfort, or what el&s;e I have received from the Eternal Fountain or Fulne&s;s, for the u&s;e or &s;ervice of either body, mind, &s;oul or &s;pirit, of my own fle&s;h or family, &s;eeing no man ever hated his own Fle&s;h; and he is wor&s;e than an Infidel that pro|videth not for his own Family, e&s;pecially them of his own Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>RIght dear, precious and Heavenly Ones, who&s;e Beauty &s;hineth bright, and at who&s;e Name the hearts of the Hea|then do tremble: We, who through the everla&s;ting Mercies of our God, are Mem|bers of the &s;ame Body, and are held in &s;trait Captivity, and hard Bondage, for witne&s;&s;ing forth the &s;ame Te&s;timony and Covenant of pure Light, Life and Truth of our God, with you dear and faithful Ones indeed; <HI>We</HI> here in the &s;ame Cove|nant of pure Love, and bowels of tender|ne&s;s, do dearly &s;alute and imbrace you all, glorifying and prai&s;ing our eternal Father for you all, who hath counted us worthy to partake of the fellow&s;hip and &s;ufferings for the Bodies &s;ake, with you in tribulati|ons, fiery tryals, manifold temptations, fa&s;tings, watchings, heats and colds, and cruel threatning and per&s;ecutions, perils by Sea, and perils by Land, &s;tanding in jeopardy of our lives year after year, and looking every hour, day and night, for ma|ny
<PB N="133" REF="78" MS="y"> Weeks together, when we &s;hould be brought out to Execution; but though Pro|clamation was made, and they came up to the very Gate with a Drum and Mu&s;|quets, to fetch us out to de&s;troy us, yet the Lord God of everla&s;ting &s;trength, who in the deepe&s;t of all dangers, and greate&s;t extremity, when all hopes were pa&s;t, did but blow upon them with the breath of his no&s;trils, and they did fly as du&s;t before the Wind; for which we do intreat all Friends to glorifie our God on our behalf; for never did the Lord our God work grea|ter Deliverance for any, than he hath done for us from time to time, who are the lea&s;t and weake&s;t, for what we know, that ever the Lord our God &s;ent forth in &s;o great and weighty a work: but all things are po&s;&s;ible with him, who made and created all things; It is he alone which carrieth on his own Work by his own mighty Pow|er, and the glory &s;hall be his own for ever|more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Oh our dearly beloved Friends, did you know but the third part of the Afflictions the Lord our God hath carried us through, you would &s;ay, The Lord hath wrought as great a Miracle in our pre&s;ervation, as ever he did in rai&s;ing <HI>Lazarus</HI> out of the

<P>Dearly beloved Friends, marvel not why <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is not gathered in all this time; it is not for want of labour, nor travel, nor
<PB N="135" REF="79"> grief, nor pain, fa&s;ting nor mourning, nor weeping, nor love to their &s;ouls; but it is becau&s;e of the great Oppre&s;&s;ion: For here are a willing people, but they dare not until the Lord make way for them. Truly Friends, we have not been idle &s;ince we &s;aw your faces, nor have we had much ea&s;e to the fle&s;h, but do travel night and day for <HI>Sion's</HI> pro&s;perity and perfect joy, and for the reparation of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and her pure prai&s;e; though our &s;orrows are deep, and our afflictions grievous, yet we do wait with patience to reap the peace|able fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and enjoy the benefit of our uprightne&s;s; Prai&s;es be to our God for ever, he hath kept us by his power and holine&s;s, that our Ene|mies have not one jot or tittle again&s;t us, but for the Truth of our God, and that we could not joyn with them; &s;o they would not &s;uffer us to have one line of refre&s;h|ment, but &s;tript us out of all, &s;o that we could not expect one drop of mercy, favour nor affection, but what our heavenly Fa|ther did di&s;til upon us from his living pre|&s;ence, and work for us by the operation of his own Arm of &s;trength and power.</P>
<P>But dear Friends, though a long Winter, and many &s;harp and terrible Storms have

Oh! how doth he ap|pear in his Glory, Beauty and Brightne&s;s, &s;o that our &s;ouls are ravi&s;hed and wrapped up with his living pre&s;ence and glory ma|ny times, &s;o that we do not dare to look out at our long-&s;ufferings nor tryals, but do pre&s;s forwards towards the fulne&s;s of Joy and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, which our eternal Father hath prepared for all them that love him, and walk in obedience to him; and we know, the deeper our &s;orrow is, the greater our Joy &s;hall be; and the heavier our Cro&s;s, the weightier our Crown, as we abide faithful: And we do believe, that neither principalities, nor powers, nor &s;uf|ferings, nor impri&s;onment, nor per&s;ecuti|on, nor life nor death, &s;hall be able to &s;e|parate us from the Love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord and Saviour, <HI>Amen:</HI></P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort Relation of &s;ome more of their exceeding great Tryals and Tempta|tions.</HEAD>
<P>NOw in &s;hort time after we were taken Pri&s;oners, we were &s;tung with Flyes called <HI>Muskatoes,</HI> in our faces &amp; our heads, as we lay in our Beds, that were &s;wollen as if we had the &s;mall-Pox, &s;o that all people were afraid of us, &s;ave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul; they thought we had been unclean per&s;ons, &s;o that a Friar told <HI>Sarah</HI> he &s;aw an evil Spirit in her face, which was a great tryal; they could not &s;leep in their beds in the hou&s;e, they were &s;o tormented; and we were told, that they had &s;een them that did pray and preach every day, were burnt for Witches in a &s;hort time; and they would keep us to &s;ee our lives &amp; conver|&s;ations; and &s;o they have: And glory be to our God, they cannot lay guilt to our charge, but are made to confe&s;s the Truth.</P>
<P>In a few dayes after we were there, in a Vi&s;ion in the night, the Lord appeared to me, and &s;hewed me, that round about us,
<PB N="143" REF="83"> and above and beneath us, there were ma|ny Magicians of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and the Lord &s;mote me, and &s;aid unto me, <HI>The Devil hath de&s;ired to winnow you as Wheat; but pray that your Faith fail not.</HI> And the &s;ight was very dreadful and terrible; and the Voice of the Lord did awake me with much trembling and amazement, and a great War, for the &s;pace of twelve hours, before I could get the victory; and we did witne&s;s but little ea&s;e to the fle&s;h night nor day. We went in obedience to the Lord to one of their Tower-Hou&s;es, in time of their Wor&s;hip, and &s;tood trem|bling in the mid&s;t of them; and I was made to turn my back to the high Altar, and kneel down, and lift up my voice in prayer unto the Lord; and he that was &s;ay|ing Service, drew off his Surplice, and kneeled a little be&s;ide us till I had done, and he reacht forth his hand to us, to come to him, and offered me a token; and the Lord &s;hewed me it was the Mark of the Bea&s;t; and I refu&s;ed it; and he put it in|to <HI>Sarah</HI>'s hand, and &s;he gave it him again, and &s;hewed him her Pur&s;e, that &s;he had to give, if any had need. And he asked if we were <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Lutherans?</HI> And we &s;aid, Nay: And he asked if we would go
<PB N="144" REF="84" MS="y"> to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope? But we denied. And he asked if we were <HI>Catholicks?</HI> And we told him, We were true Chir&s;tians, the Servants of the living God. And many of them were amazed, and came round about us; we having but little of their Tongue, gave our Te&s;timony (for the Lord) in words and &s;igns, as well as we could; and they were made &s;ubject to the Power at that pre&s;ent, prai&s;es be given to our God, and we departed in peace.</P>
<P>And &s;ince that, the Lord laid &s;uch a hea|vy burthen upon us, that we did que&s;tion what he would do with us, before we knew the mind of God in it. And upon a &s;et-day they had a great Meeting to take their holy Sacrament (as they call it) in a high place; but we knew nothing of it, nor where it was, but what the Lord revealed to us: And we were made to go in, and &s;tand in the mid&s;t; and there were many lights in divers places, &amp; many Chri&s;ts, as they call them, and much co&s;tline&s;s and a|bominations of the Earth; they had &s;o many &s;orts of holy Garments (as they call them) of &s;o many colours, that it would make one wonder how the Devil did invent it. And there we were made to &s;tand in the mid&s;t for the &s;pace of three parts of an
<PB N="145" REF="84"> hour, as near as I can judge, in great pow|er, trembling and quaking, and bitter mourning, &s;o that they were all amazed, and &s;ome removed further for fear, but knew not what to do; for I never did wit|ne&s;s &s;uch an Earthquake. In the end one came &s;oberly, and &s;pake to us to go forth; and we went in the Lord's time, and &s;ate at the door trembling and mourning, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of them; and being &s;o overcome with their Abominations, we went along the &s;treet reeling to and fro, and &s;taggering like drunken men, &s;o that we were a wound to all that &s;aw us: It was the wonderful Power of God that made way for us to go forth to them, and kept us. They have u&s;ed all the Craft they have day and night, to inchant us, as the Lord hath made it known unto us; Glory and prai&s;es be to his everla&s;ting Name for evermore. We know that there is no In|chantment again&s;t <HI>Jacob,</HI> nor divination again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>

<P>Truly Friends, we are not able to de|clare the large Mercies of our God, vouch|&s;afed unto us from time to time; his Horn is our Strength, and his Name our &s;trong Tower in all our troubles, temptations, tryals and &s;ufferings; he is a God at hand, and not afar off, and doth make us &s;en&s;i|ble before-hand, by Vi&s;ions and Revelati|ons, what is coming upon us; and doth arm us with his own Armour, and makes us as bold as Lyons; for we fear not the face of man, becau&s;e we know we &s;hall not &s;uffer any thing but what &s;hall make for the glory of our God: But truly we had fainted long ago, had not the Lord upheld us by his free Spirit; but we know the Lord taketh care of the lea&s;t of them that tru&s;t him; Prai&s;es be unto him for ever. Dear Friends, though we be ab&s;ent in bo|dy, yet we are pre&s;ent in &s;pirit, and do feel you in that which cannot be &s;epara|ted, as we abide faithful, and are much refre&s;hed in you; and the remembrance of you is precious unto us: Oh, that all our Friends could prize the company and the &s;ight of each others faces. We do not want the company of Friars, Je&s;uites and Ma|gi&s;trates,
<PB N="147" REF="85" MS="y"> nor great women. Here are &s;ome that have breathings after Life, but they dare not &s;hew it; for the &s;ame thing that was, is; they will not enter in them|&s;elves, nor &s;uffer them that would.</P>
<P>The Lord Inqui&s;itor &s;ent to us, That if we would (being we are good women) we &s;hould go into the Nunnery among&s;t the holy women, and be maintained as long as we live, in regard we have denied the world, and all that we have. And the Friar told us, if we would come to their Ma&s;&s;e-hou&s;e, and receive their holy Sacrament, we &s;hould be the mo&s;t eminent Catholicks in all <HI>Malta.</HI> But we denied them in the Name of the Lord, and all their dead fop|pery which they have invented. Here we are kept under the Inqui&s;ition, as they &s;ay, till they have Orders from the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> what they &s;hould do with us.</P>
<P>We be&s;eech you all, faithful Friends, pray for us, for great are our tryals: Did you but know the Abominations that the Devil hath invented here, you would think it were tryal enough. But here we have cruel mockings; and the &s;ame contra|dictions, tryals and temptations that ever the Servants of the Lord had, and Chri&s;t him&s;elf. It is the wonderful Power of

We have been near death many times, when we had none to come near us, but tho&s;e that preached death and de|&s;truction to us; I have lain twelve dayes, or more, in a fa&s;t, in &s;trong travel night and day, that my dearly beloved Yoke|mate

And there we lay, none knowing from morning to morning whether we were dead or alive.

<P>The time is too little for me to di&s;clo&s;e the twentieth part of the terrible tryals; but when&s;oever we were brought upon any tryal, the Lord did take away all fear from us, and multiplied our &s;trength, and gave us power and boldne&s;s to plead for the Truth of the Lord Je&s;us, and wi&s;dom of words, to &s;top the mouthes of the gain|&s;ayers, that they would be made to &s;ay, We &s;pake Truth; they could never &s;ay o|therwi&s;e: But they would &s;ay, <HI>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Virtues.</HI></P>

The <HI>25^t^h</HI> day of the &s;ixth month, called <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the year <HI>1662.</HI> near the tenth hour of the day, the Word of the Lord came unto me, &s;aying, Thou mu&s;t pro|phe&s;ie yet once more in my Name to the Heads and Rulers, Princes and Governours of <HI>Mal|ta,</HI> the afore&s;aid City, and prophe&s;ie &s;aying, Thus &s;aith the Lord God of power, who made Heaven and Earth, the Seas and all things that are therein, and is the Pre&s;erver of all mankind, e&s;pecially of them that do believe in his Name, My wrath is kindled again&s;t you, and my Judgment is &s;et up amongst you, be|cau&s;e of your hard-heartedne&s;s and unbelief.

<P>This have I written in obedience to the God of all Power, whom I truly &s;erve in &s;pirit and in truth, according to my mea|&s;ure.

<P>This have we prophe&s;ied ever &s;ince the time you call <HI>Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,</HI> as we have been moved of the Spirit of the Lord, and delivered it to the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> to take it to the <HI>Grand Ma&s;ter,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Heads and Governors. The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> threa|tened me with the Pri&s;on again. The Lord &s;aid, <HI>Fear not, I am thy God.</HI> And in a few dayes after the Lord uttered his Voice, and manife&s;ted his mighty Po|wer in great Thunder and Lightning, &s;o that it &s;et on fire one of their Powder-hou&s;es, being near a mile out of the City. It was in the eighth month, the eighth day of the month, in the night, according to their account; and the wind of the Pow|der blew down another Powder-hou&s;e, a quarter of a mile from it, but the Powder was pre&s;erved; and it did great execution in the City, as they &s;ay, it blowed down five Hou&s;es, and broke mo&s;t of the Gla&s;s Windows of both Palaces, and all the Merchants Windows in the City; and the Magazine where the Merchants Goods were, the Doors were blown out of the hooks, and the Walls &s;haken and torn, and the whole City was terribly &s;haken,
<PB N="241" REF="122" MS="y"> and the doors of the hou&s;es drew up, &s;o that great fear fell upon them all; and we heard a great &s;hreem in the City, it was at mid|night, and they rung out their Bells; and there was a great Gla&s;s Window in the Chamber where we lay, over right our Beds-feet, it was very thick Gla&s;s, and much of it was broken to pieces, and beat in on each &s;ide of our bed, but the Lord did not &s;uffer any harm to us, the glory is his own. The Hou&s;e was &s;o &s;haken, that we did exceedingly fear and quake, but it was taken from us in a moment of time, and we gave up unto the Lord to live or to die, and we had great joy and peace in the Lord. And when it was day the <HI>Con|&s;ul</HI> came to us, and asked of us whether we were not dead, becau&s;e we were &s;till and quiet; and while he was &s;peaking, there came in one after another declaring what was done in the City; and he told us how all his Chamber doors were drew o|pen, and what great fear he was in, and all the States in the City; he &s;aid the Ships in the Harbour had &s;ome harm too. There was never the like known in that place they &s;aid. We an&s;wered them, &s;aying, <HI>One Wo is pa&s;t, and behold another Wo cometh quickly, if you do not repent:</HI> yet they re|pented
<PB N="242" REF="123"> not of their bla&s;phemy, rebellion, hard-heartedne&s;s, nor unbelief, but they ran up and down to their fathers the Sor|cerers, Inchanters and Wi&s;ards, and they &s;oon piec'd them up again. There were many of the Friars did dwell near the <HI>Con|&s;ul</HI>'s, and we did &s;ee their running to and fro; and in few dayes after <HI>Sarah</HI> was cal|led to fa&s;ting, and to baldne&s;s, and to &s;trew a&s;hes upon her head, and to &s;it upon the ground with her upper parts naked for &s;ome time, and the Power of the Lord did work mightily in it, and they were amazed at it from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t; and the Lord opened her mouth, and &s;he &s;pake to the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> to tell the <HI>Grand Ma&s;ter</HI> to pro|claim a Fa&s;t, and to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their minds turned to the Light; for the Lord called for Repen|tance, and for fa&s;ting and baldne&s;s, and girding on of &s;ackcloth, that &s;o he might turn away his righteous Judgments from them; for the hour of his Judgments was come, wherein the Painted Harlot &s;hould be &s;tripped naked, and a Cup of trembling &s;hould be given her from the hand of the Lord; and many did die of a violent Fea|ver; and we were much exerci&s;ed in fa&s;t|ing: and the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> went forth with the
<PB N="243" REF="123"> news among&s;t the Magi&s;trates, and they talked with the Friars, and they told them we had a good intent; and in a &s;hort time after the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> &s;ent a <HI>Dutch</HI> Friar and one of the other; the Lord had prepared us for their coming; and when they came the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> called us before them, and &s;o he talked a little while with us, and he &s;aid, <HI>we had a good intent, but the Devil had de|ceived us.</HI> We asked him, whether the Devil could give power over &s;in, yea or nay? He &s;aid, <HI>the Devil could transform him&s;elf into an Angel of Light.</HI> We an|&s;wered him, we did know he could, but he could not hide him&s;elf from the Chil|dren of Light: but they that were in the dark could not di&s;cern him. He was not able to hear us, nor to &s;tay in the room, but the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> did &s;tand up again&s;t us, and accu&s;ed us to him fal&s;ly before our faces, as we made it to appear to him, and &s;o they departed; and the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> wrought de&s;perately again&s;t us to get us into bon|dage again, but our God was with us: and &s;eeing he could not prevail again&s;t us, to get us into Pri&s;on again, then he and his Confederates combined together how to cheat us of our Money. I do believe they received the Books before we came
<PB N="244" REF="124"> out of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> for we received dear <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Letter from <HI>Legorn</HI> that did men|tion them: We felt his workings day and night, he came &s;ubtilly to us, and told us he had wrought to &s;et us at liberty, and the <HI>Qui&s;itor</HI> and <HI>Grand Ma&s;ter</HI> bid him &s;end us away by the next convenient pa&s;&s;age; But now the Devil had &s;ent Books out of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and he &s;aid he knew not what to do with them, the Magi&s;trates would not let us go; if they &s;hould know of them, they would &s;ay we would &s;end more when we came to <HI>England;</HI> and he asked us whe|the we would receive them? We asked him, whether they were directed to us? he &s;aid, <HI>No.</HI> We bid him deliver them where they were directed, what&s;oever we did &s;uffer for it. He kept much ado and &s;aid, <HI>If we would give a grandy Prie&s;t ten or twelve Scoothes,</HI> (which is near fifty &s;hil|lings) <HI>they would conceal them.</HI> We an|&s;wered, Nay, it was of the Lord, in love to their &s;ouls, he &s;hould deliver them up, and make good u&s;e of them that their &s;ouls might live. He raged at us, but &s;aid no more of that to us.</P>
<P>In a little while after there came a <HI>Hol|land</HI> Ship, which was bound for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> &s;ent to us to come &amp; &s;peak
<PB N="245" REF="124"> with him, it was in the evening, I was going to bed; I felt a filthy thing, and had no freedom to go to him, but <HI>Sarah</HI> went; yet he came to me and told me, <HI>There was a Holland Ship bound for</HI> Smyrna, <HI>if we would promi&s;e him to &s;tay there till he came back, he would call for us.</HI> We told the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> we &s;tood in the Will of God, and we could not promi&s;e any thing, unle&s;s we knew the mind of God in it. He was very angry, and &s;aid <HI>we would dwell at Malta.</HI> Now we told him, we did believe the Lord had appointed a Ve&s;&s;el to carry us, whether it was that yea or nay, we knew not; we did not know whether that might come back in half a year; and however we did not mean to hire a Ship on purpo&s;e to fetch us. We &s;aid he might &s;end us in a Barque to <HI>Me&s;cena,</HI> and there we might imbarque for <HI>Legorn.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>No; the In|qui&s;itor &s;aid if we &s;hould go thither, we would preach God to the Roman Catholicks, and he did not love that; and there was an</HI> Inqui&s;i|tion <HI>that did belong to the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>and though the Pope had &s;et us free, yet he would take us Pri&s;oners again.</HI> We told him we would adventure that; but he had an end of his own in it: he had much Anni&s;e to &s;end to <HI>Legorn,</HI> and he would have had us
<PB N="246" REF="125"> to engage the <HI>Flemen</HI> to call for us to carry that too, that we might have paid part for the carriage of it; but our God had ap|pointed a greater work for us to do which we knew not of.</P>
<P>In a little time after we were freed from the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> he told us <HI>Daniel</HI> took up an hundred Dollers, and he would have us &s;end to <HI>Me&s;cena</HI> for an hundred more. We told him, we had received no &s;uch order, and withal asked him what we &s;hould do with &s;o much money, &s;eeing we had mo|ney in his hands? and &s;aid, we would not &s;end for money to keep us in bonds; and minded him of his Promi&s;e to dear <HI>Da|niel Baker.</HI> He &s;aid <HI>Daniel</HI> could not re|deem us out of Pri&s;on, but he had &s;tood Cap in hand to the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> for us. That was true, if he had continued faithful, great would have been his reward, but he &s;ought him&s;elf in it; and when his ex|pected end was not an&s;wered, then he and his wife and &s;ervants were very bitter again&s;t us for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, in-&s;o-much that we &s;tood in great hazard of our lives; many a time we did feel their &s;lay|ing In&s;truments drawn, &s;o that we had even the &s;entence of death in our &s;elves, but the Lord prevented them, and pre|&s;erved
<PB N="247" REF="125"> us, and great was our travel of &s;oul night and day; the glory is the Lord's, who&s;e mighty Power did the work: ever|la&s;ting prai&s;es, honour and dominion over all to our pure, holy and perfect Lord God, world without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the &s;atisfaction of all Friends concerning our deliverance out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>In|qui&s;ition,</HI> this is a true and brief Relation. Three quarters of a year before <HI>Daniel Ba|ker</HI> came to <HI>Malta,</HI> the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> for the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> came to us, and &s;aid, <HI>the Inqui&s;itor &s;ent him to know if we would be Catholicks yea or nay?</HI> We an&s;wered, we were true Chri|&s;tians. He &s;aid, <HI>if we would be Catholicks, we might dwell at</HI> Melita, <HI>or go to</HI> England. We &s;aid we were the Servants of the true and living God. One of the Magi&s;trates &s;aid, <HI>we were not Chri&s;tians, neither had we the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> We an&s;wered, we were <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and had received the Spirit of Chri&s;t which made a Chri&s;tian, and he that had not the Spirit of Chri&s;t was no Chri|&s;tian, and we had the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; without the Cro&s;s there was no Salvation: the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that belie|veth.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="126">
<P>He &s;aid, <HI>If we would not be Catholicks, we mu&s;t &s;uffer long Impri&s;onment by the Popes Order.</HI> That was not true, I had an An|&s;wer in my Con&s;cience again&s;t it. And in a little time after they told us, <HI>if we would ki&s;s the Cro&s;s we &s;hould be freed out of Pri|&s;on, and go to the Con&s;ul's till a convenient pa&s;&s;age did pre&s;ent to carry us for</HI> England; for the Pope had &s;ent word they &s;hould take it into their con&s;ideration, and &s;et us free for <HI>England,</HI> without doing any violencce, as we heard, and we did believe it, be|cau&s;e we had a more &s;ure word of Prophe|cy than did u&s;e to proceed out of their mouthes: we told them we could not ki&s;s the Cro&s;s to get our liberty, neither did we de&s;ire our freedom on any &s;uch terms; but we looked every day when they would call us forth to ki&s;s the Cro&s;s, and we did pray and cry mightily to our Eternal Fa|ther to prevent them in it, and to pre&s;erve us out of it; for the Tempter was very &s;trong within and without, &s;o that I took little re&s;t for many dayes and nights, &s;ee|ing the great danger it would plunge us into; for I &s;aw the painted walls, and the Cro&s;&s;es &s;et before me, but the gracious God of power, who did appear in our Af|flictions, and revealed his Will to me in a
<PB N="249" REF="126"> Night-Vi&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not, but wait diligently up|on me: you have two things yet to work over before you can be &s;et at liberty.</HI> We knew the Cro&s;s was one, but we knew not what the other was.</P>
<P>The next time the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> came, he told us that the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If any one would engage for three or four thou&s;and Dollers to be paid if ever we came thither again, we &s;hould be &s;et at liberty,</HI> but he &s;aid no more of the Cro&s;s; but the Obligation was the &s;econd thing that we were to work over, but I could never &s;ee, nor dare de&s;ire any man to be engaged for us, becau&s;e I do know all Decrees, Laws, Tyes, Bonds and Chains, and Precepts of men mu&s;t be bro|ken through the righteous Decree of our mighty Lord God, and upon the &s;ame con|&s;ideration we were made willing to wait, till the Lord &s;hould break this Chain al&s;o, that no other dear Friend or Lamb of God might &s;uffer for the &s;ame thing; no, God forbid.</P>
<P>Then it plea&s;ed the Lord to &s;end <HI>Daniel Baker,</HI> who in obedience to the God of Heaven did offer up body for body, yea life &amp; all for our liberty, but could not be heard; but the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If any would
<PB N="250" REF="127"> engage for the payment of three or four thou|&s;and Dollers, to be paid if ever we came there again, we &s;hould have our liberty; but other|wi&s;e we mu&s;t die in the Pri&s;on, for that was the Pope's Law:</HI> but we knew it was left to his con&s;ideration, &s;o we told them we could not engage, nor de&s;ire any to en|gage for us, becau&s;e it was out of the Co|venant of God; and our <HI>yea was yea,</HI> and our <HI>nay was nay,</HI> and we did not believe that ever it was the mind of God that we &s;hould return thither again. So <HI>Daniel</HI> departed in the Love of God, and they &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> to Friends, and to other I&s;lands to the Engli&s;h Merchants, for &s;ome to engage for us, that we might have our liberty, but the Merchants &s;ent word they were not willing to an&s;wer their unrea|&s;onable demands, for the payment of &s;o many thou&s;and Dollers, if in ca&s;e we re|turned thither again. There were many that did &s;eek for our liberty, that were not of us, becau&s;e they knew our cruel and &s;trait bondage and terrible afflictions, and were willing to engage what was rea&s;on; but becau&s;e our ju&s;t and wi&s;e God would make his Power known for his own ho|nour, he would not &s;uffer any thing to prevail for our Deliverance, in&s;omuch as
<PB N="251" REF="127"> we could under&s;tand, but what he wrought by his invi&s;ible Power in the hearts of our Enemies. It was given into my heart half a year after <HI>Daniel</HI> came thence, that if I could &s;peak with the <HI>Inqui&s;itor,</HI> he would grant us our liberty; and in a little time he came to the Inqui&s;ition-Court-Cham|ber, and we heard of it, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, which he granted us, and we told him we had wronged none, we had defrauded none, neither was guile found in our mouthes; but we had &s;uffered inno|cently almo&s;t four years, for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, and we knew they had no peace in our &s;ufferings. So the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> was very courteous to us, and promi&s;ed our liberty in a few dayes, and he &s;aid he would &s;end for the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> and get him to engage for five hundred Dollers to be paid for us, if ever we came again; in ca&s;e the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> did deny it, he would &s;end to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope for an Order to &s;et us at liberty with|out an Obligation. So we were contented to wait the Lord's time; who had often promi&s;ed us, <HI>That we &s;hould have our liberty in a day when we thought not of, and at an hour when we were not aware;</HI> and good was the Word of the Lord, and faithful in all his Promi&s;es.</P>
<PB N="252" REF="128">
<P>About two weeks after the <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> came to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> with his Lieute|nant and other of the Magi&s;trates, and a <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he &s;ent the Proctor of the Court to call us forth before them; and when we came he told us, <HI>the Con&s;ul would engage for the payment of five hundred Dollers, if ever we returned thither again.</HI> We not knowing at pre&s;ent whe|ther it was the mind of our heavenly Fa|ther that the Earth &s;hould help the Wo|man yea or nay, yet waiting in the Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r of God, it was brought to my remembrance that the Lord had &s;aid <HI>we had two things to work over, before we could be &s;et at liberty.</HI> So they u&s;ed many words, but we eying the Lord, yet an&s;wered them in the Spirit of meekne&s;s. They called for half a &s;heet of paper, and the <HI>Chancellour</HI> asked what he &s;hould write? but the Lord &s;tood up for his own glory, &s;o that they had not power to write one Letter. The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> &s;aid, <HI>they would talk of it another time;</HI> and they did ask us, <HI>whether we would not return back again to our Husbands and Children, if it were the will of God?</HI> We an&s;wered, It was our intent in the will of God &s;o to do. The <HI>Lord Inqui&s;itor</HI> took his leave very courteou&s;ly of us, and de&s;ired our pro&s;pe|rous
<PB N="253" REF="128"> return into our Country; and like|wi&s;e the Magi&s;trates, with the inferiour Officers, not requiring penny or penny-worths for any Fees or Attendance that we had among them in that time; but as we &s;aw our freedom in the Lord, we gave the Keeper and &s;ome poor men &s;omething for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>So we departed in peace, according to the compleat example of the holy men of God, kneeling down and de&s;iring our hea|venly Father never to lay to their charge what they did unto us, becau&s;e they knew us not; &s;o this Scripture was fulfilled, <HI>that he made our enemies our foot&s;tool, and they that hate us without a cau&s;e to be at peace with us.</HI> So we were delivered in Power and great glory out of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> into the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s hand to be &s;ent for <HI>England,</HI> as opportunity did pre&s;ent. The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> &s;aid that he did engage for us after we were out of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> but we could never find that it was true.</P>
<P>So we were kept eleven weeks at the <HI>Con&s;ul's</HI> hou&s;e, before they could have a pa&s;&s;age to carry us out of their Coa&s;t; and the Cro&s;s was &s;o heavy, and the travel of &s;ouls &s;o great, that, as to the vi&s;ible, all hopes were pa&s;t that I could live in the bo|dy;
<PB N="254" REF="129"> but all things are po&s;&s;ible with God, who by his mighty Power hath removed Mountains, and &s;ubdued the Earth, and broke through the double-doors, locks and bolts, and Iron bars, and all the chains of wickedne&s;s, &amp; every unrighteous Decree; and by his high &amp; mighty Hand and &s;trong out&s;tretched Arm hath returned our Cap|tivity, that <HI>Jacob</HI> may rejoyce and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> may be glad, magnified be the Name of our Eternal Father for ever; yea, Honour and Glory, Power and Dominion over all to him who ruleth on high, world without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And when we had been at the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s hou&s;e eleven weeks, there came one of the King's Frigats, called the <HI>Saphire,</HI> the Captain's name was <HI>Samuel Tit&s;wel.</HI> The <HI>Grand-Ma&s;ter</HI> &s;ent to the Captain of the <HI>Saphire</HI> to entreat him to &s;tay the Ship all night, to take up almo&s;t forty Pa&s;&s;engers. The Captain made him&s;elf unwilling, be|cau&s;e he had no product, but lay out in the Road a league from the City.

<P>So we came to <HI>Tangeer</HI> above two weeks before the Fleet came. The Captain &s;aid it was above an hundred pound out of his way, becau&s;e he made &s;o much ha&s;te.

So the Governour &s;aid, he did lovingly re|ceive our good In&s;tructions and Admoni|tions, and promi&s;ed to follow our Coun|&s;el; and would have given us money, and de&s;ired us to eat and drink in his hou&s;e.

<P>And in a few dayes after it was laid upon us of the Lord, to go forth to meet the <HI>Moors</HI> their Enemies, which laid &s;iege a|gain&s;t them, and they were &s;uch a bloody &s;avage people, that it &s;eemed a very hard thing to us, but the Lord &s;aid unto me, <HI>Go forth, fear not, they &s;hall not harm th&eacute;e, or you, Behold the Sword of the Lord and of</HI> Gideon <HI>is with you.</HI> And &s;o we believed, and were made willing to adventure life and all in obedience.

So I pa&s;&s;ing through the like dangers (through the great love of God, which cau&s;ed me to glorifie his ble&s;&s;ed Name) I came (though in much weakne&s;s of body) unto <HI>Ramlah,</HI> or <HI>Ramoth Gilead,</HI> and going through the Town I was known (having been there before) two men of the &s;aid Town, Ad|herents to the Friars (which before had oppo&s;ed me) aro&s;e and laid hold on me, and hurried me in a violent manner to|wards the place in the Town, in which be|fore I had been kept pri&s;oner; but as they were abu&s;ing me, there came two <HI>Turks</HI> and threw them violently from me, and took me from them, one leading me by one arm, the other by the other arm, and in that manner brought me to one of their Hou&s;es of Wor&s;hip or <HI>Mo&s;co;</HI> and I being entered thereinto, many people gathered together therein, al&s;o the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> before whom I was called and cau&s;ed to &s;it down; And then it was de|manded of me, <HI>Whether I would turn unto the Turks Religion?</HI> I an&s;wered, I could not turn unto them: but they pre&s;&s;ed me very much, and &s;aid they would give me great things, and I &s;hould not need fear what the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> could do unto me.
<PB N="287" REF="145"> Neverthele&s;s I an&s;wered, I could not turn unto them for all the World: yet mighti|ly did many &s;trive with me with an ardent affection, and would have had me hold up one finger, as a &s;ign of owning them: and one bid me &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t is bad;</HI> I an&s;wer|ed, I knew him to be good, and I was his Servant.

<P>After this they were much broken down in their &s;pirits, as men who&s;e &s;trength fai|led, and then the afore&s;aid Antient man took me, and ordered his &s;ervants to con|duct me to his hou&s;e, where he friendly entertained me; but within about four or five dayes time there came a Guard of Hor&s;emen, which I under&s;tood the Friars had hired to bring me before the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Gaza;</HI> for, as it was told me, the Friars in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had pre-informed the &s;aid <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> again&s;t me (whom they looked up|on to be their chiefe&s;t friend in all the&s;e parts) who de&s;ired me to be brought be|fore him, and &s;wore he would kill me in his own per&s;on; and with the afore&s;aid Guard of armed men I was brought in two dayes unto <HI>Gaza</HI> (where <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> formerly dwelt) where I remained about five days; in which time it was &s;aid I &s;hould go be|fore the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> but it came not &s;o to pa&s;s, for he being informed by &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> of the

<P>According to the afore-mentioned Or|der, I was brought to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but being come thither, the Friars laid wait for me, and by their appointment I was taken and brought to their Convent, where at fir&s;t they &s;eemingly &s;hewed love unto me, and
<PB N="290" REF="147"> one confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>there was now an evident &s;ign that I was a good Chri&s;tian, for I was come through Per&s;ecution and Sufferings; and tho&s;e things which had been &s;poken of me to the con|trary were manife&s;t to be untrue.</HI> I an&s;wered, It was he and his brethren which had per|&s;ecuted and cau&s;ed me to &s;uffer, and with|&s;tood my coming to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>The Engli&s;h</HI> (a Friar like him&s;elf) <HI>had in|formed them by writing again&s;t me, which cau&s;ed them to do what they had done unto me, and de&s;ired I would now pa&s;s tho&s;e things by, &s;eeing I was come in &s;uch a miraculous manner; for it was the Lord's work</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>to carry me through, and I might prai&s;e God I was pre&s;erved.</HI> The next morning there came a Friar unto me, and asked me, <HI>If I would become an obedient child, and go to vi&s;it the Holy Places</HI> (as he called them) <HI>accord|ing to their cu&s;toms?</HI> I an&s;wered, Nay, I &s;hould not vi&s;it them. He &s;aid, <HI>Whereas others give great &s;ums of money to &s;ee them, I &s;hould &s;ee them for nothing.</HI> I an&s;wered, Nay, I &s;hould not vi&s;it them in their man|ner, for in &s;o doing I &s;hould &s;in again&s;t God. He &s;aid, <HI>they would honour me as much as ever they honoured any Engli&s;h-man that ever came thither, if I would conform unto them.</HI> I &s;aid, Nay, I &s;hould not conform;
<PB N="291" REF="147"> and as for their honor, I mattered not for it. Then he became wrath and &s;aid, <HI>They would make me an example to all Engli&s;h-men that &s;hould come thither.</HI> I &s;aid, I cho&s;e ra|ther their di&s;honour than their honour. He then &s;eeing he could not prevail over me with his temptations, he in anger pa&s;&s;ed from me, and in a &s;hort time came again, and called me to divers of his Brethren; the chief among them asked me, <HI>If I would vi&s;it their Church, and the holy Sepulchre, and</HI> Bethlehem, <HI>and the re&s;t of the holy places, as other Pilgrims did?</HI> I &s;aid, at the pre&s;ent I had no bu&s;ine&s;s to vi&s;it them, and in their manner I &s;hould not vi&s;it them at all (that is to &s;ay, wor&s;hip them) Then one of them &s;aid, <HI>How could I be a Servant of God, and would not go to vi&s;it the places where the holy men of God dwelt?</HI> I an&s;wered, That they, under pretence of doing &s;ervice to God, in vi&s;iting the places where the holy men dwelt, they did oppo&s;e that Way, and re&s;i&s;t that Life, which the holy men of God lived and walked in. One of them &s;aid, <HI>What, did I preach unto them?</HI> I &s;aid, I would have them turn from tho&s;e evil practices they lived in, el&s;e the Wrath of the Almighty would break forth upon them, or words to that effect. They further &s;aid, <HI>If I would
<PB N="292" REF="148"> not go to vi&s;it the places before-mentioned, would I give the</HI> 25. <HI>Dollers, as is the manner of tho&s;e that vi&s;ited them? for</HI> (&s;aid they) <HI>the Turks mu&s;t be paid whether I would vi&s;it them or not; but if I would vi&s;it them, then they would pay it for me.</HI> I &s;aid, I would not have them to pay it for me; but if the <HI>Turks</HI> had a Law to compel me to pay 25. Dollers when I vi&s;ited not the places, as tho&s;e did pay that did vi&s;it them, I &s;aid that Law was unequal; and I &s;hould chu&s;e rather to &s;uffer the penalty of the &s;ame in breaking it, than to give 25. Dollers to fulfil it.</P>
<P>After this the Popi&s;h Friars brought me before a <HI>Turk</HI> in Authority in that place, who asked me di|vers Que&s;tions, and &s;oberly received An&s;wers ther|unto; and &s;oberly di&s;cour&s;ed with me about the Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and al&s;o asked me the ground of my coming to <HI>Jeru&s;alem?</HI> I an&s;wered him, The Lord God of Heaven and Earth had ap|peared unto me, and commanded me to come thi|ther, and in obedience unto him I was come; and further, in the power of the Lord I declared the great and tender love of God in vi&s;iting them, and his great and compa&s;&s;ionate mercies that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering. And this was that which lay upon me from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear or forbear.</P>
<P>And thus, my dear Friends, I cleared my Con|&s;cience, whether they would hear or forbear; wher|in I found great peace with the Lord, who in my many tryals was not wanting unto me, but magnified his glorious Name in going along with me, and pre|&s;erving me; to whom is all the glory due for ever|more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
