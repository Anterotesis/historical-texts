<HEAD>Adverti&s;ment to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>COurteous Reader, we give you a true Relation of what hath pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>two Northern Kings,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Treaty of Pacification at Rot&s;hild, in February la&s;t,</HI> 1657/8 as it was Printed in <HI>the Dani&s;h, and High Dutch Languages, by the</HI> Order of the <HI>King,</HI> and the approbation of the <HI>Senatators of the Kingdome of Denmark,</HI> who acknowledg it, to be theirs. This will doubtle&s;&s;e meet with a better admittance, and credit then one which hath been formerly publi&s;hed, <HI>on the behalf of the Swedes,</HI> we know not by whom, only in the <HI>Engli&s;h tongue,</HI> &amp; que&s;ttionle&s;s by a mercinary Pen, which &s;ticketh not to write any thing, right, or wronge, truth, or untruth, &s;o it may but &s;erve turne, to inveagle this Nation: which he thinks to delude by his &s;mooth expre&s;&s;ions: the rather becau&s;e they live re|mote from the place where the&s;e tran&s;actions have pa&s;&s;ed, and how|beit, we might per&s;awde our &s;elves, that this Relation will be &s;uf|ficient, to di&s;cover the truth to tho&s;e that read it, without parti|ality on either &s;ide. Yet for the Readers better &s;atisfaction, we have prefixed a Letter written by an impartiall hand from Ham|borow, which will afforde much light to tho&s;e, who &s;hall give them|&s;elves the trouble to read the <HI>Swedi&s;h Paper,</HI> and to compare the one Relation, with the other: Mean while we &s;hall commend you to the Protection of the Almighty, not doubting, but you will wi&s;h a good &s;ucce&s;s to that party, which you will finde to have ju&s;tice on its &s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER Writen from HAMBOROUGH, BY AN IMPARTIAL HAND, To a Friend at <HI>LONDON.</HI> Whereby the &s;everal Mi&s;takes, and Sini&s;ter Allegations, in the Swedi&s;h Relation, Printed at <HI>London,</HI> are laid open, and publi&s;hed for the Satisfaction of &s;uch as de&s;ire to be rightly informed.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter of the third of <HI>Decembr.</HI> and withall the Book entituled, <HI>A true Relation of the Rea&s;ons which nece&s;&s;i|tated His Maje&s;tie of Sweden to continue the War with Denmark:</HI> And whereas we that live in this Cittie, neerer to the Place which is the <HI>Bloody Theatre of Mars,</HI> then you do, could ne|ver till this very day hear of any &s;uch thing, as a Rea&s;on, whereby his &s;aid Maje&s;ty was moved to undertake this Second Expedition, again&s;t that already &s;ufficiently afflicted Kingdom of Denmark; I &s;uppo&s;ed, that perhaps Kings, like unto great Figures in Tape&s;try, were be&s;t ob&s;erved at a Di&s;tance; and their Actions be&s;t con&s;idered by tho&s;e that are remote; who for the mo&s;t part judge of them more &s;incerely, and freely, as being le&s;s &s;wayed by Partiality. For I could not imagine, that it was a <HI>Work publi&s;hed by the Swedi&s;h Party,</HI> who a&s;&s;uredly would have divulged it, either in their own Language or in Latin, before it &s;hould have apeared in Engli&s;h. But to be free with you, my opinion was, that <HI>His Majestie</HI> would not at all have publi&s;hed his rea&s;ons in Print, contenting him&s;elf with the Declara|tion thereon made, by the <HI>Earl of Slippenbagh his Commi&s;&s;ioner,</HI> to the <HI>Dani&s;h
<PB N="2" REF="3"> Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> before <HI>Coppenhaguen,</HI> to wit, <HI>that his Maje&s;ties inten|tion was to Ma&s;ter the Citties, and &s;trong places, as well as be had the Country; which is as much as to &s;ay, I have a minde to be the &s;ole Sove|raigne of the</HI> 3 <HI>Northren Kingdomes.</HI> Or if his Maje&s;tie would &s;o in|geniou&s;ly have declared his minde to all the world. I thought it might have been done in a le&s;&s;e volume; for mo&s;t men knew it al|ready, and as to tho&s;e that were ignorant thereof, they needed but to call to minde what expeditions <HI>the King of Sweden</HI> hath undertak|en &s;ince he came to the Crown; and &s;o little Rethorick would have &s;erved turn, to per&s;wade them thereunto. The&s;e and &s;uch like rea|&s;ons, unnece&s;&s;arie to be alledged, made me &s;uppo&s;e <HI>an indifferent hone&s;t man might have been the Author of the book;</HI> who would have performed what the <HI>Title be&s;peaketh, To be true in his relation, and to &s;hew what rea&s;ons nece&s;&s;itated the King of Sweden, to continue the Warr: as well as the truth, that the warr was continued,</HI> and might with as much truth have affirmed, <HI>that the peace concluded at Ro&s;chilt was nothing le&s;s then a peace, or rather nothing el&s;e &s;ave a &s;tratagem of war, whereby the Swedes have gotten into their power the Provinces of Shonen, Bleking, Halland, and a great part of Norway, together with all the &s;trong places of the &s;ame without the lo&s;&s;e of one &s;ingle man,</HI> which all the <HI>power of Sweden,</HI> would have found very difficult to have compa&s;|sed, by force of arms, in many years.</P>
<P>And perceiving by the Title, <HI>that the King of Sweden was nece&s;&s;itated to continue the war again&s;t Denmark.</HI> I was the more earne&s;t to per|u&s;e the book, hoping in the fir&s;t place, to have found the <HI>rea&s;on of this nece&s;&s;itated &s;econd inva&s;ion, to have been the Au&s;trian, Polonian, and Brandenburge&s;h forces uniting them&s;elves into a body of an army, &s;o con&s;iderable, as that his Maje&s;tie had rea&s;on to conceive him&s;elf too weak to fight them with advantage, or without endangering his own forces,</HI> which, <HI>rebus &s;ic &s;tantibus, might yet be &s;ufficient to oppre&s;&s;e the King of Denmark, unarmed, and unawares: who&s;e Kingdomes con&s;i&s;ting in I|&s;lands, might the better &s;helter him, and his army, by rea&s;on the afore|&s;aid forces, could not probably well attempt them there; nor could the World term it a retreat, whil'&s;t thereby his Maje&s;tie might have gained the whole Kingdome of Denmark. And by taking but</HI> 40, <HI>or</HI> 50 <HI>Pr. Ct. toll in the &s;ound, of tho&s;e that traffick in the Baltick Sea, as his Prede|ce&s;&s;or
<PB N="3" REF="3"> King Gu&s;tavus Adolphus had formerly done at the Pillow, in the Years two and three and thirty: might haue rai&s;ed &s;uch a va&s;t &s;umme of money, as would have enabled him to overrune the re&s;t of his Neighbours, in whose Countreys, his all de&s;troying Army, had not as yet exerci&s;ed their unheard of Cruelties.</HI></P>
<P>But I no &s;ooner turned the leaf, and ca&s;t my eye upon the work (who&s;e in&s;cription had been &s;o plea&s;ing to me) when I found my &s;elf very much deceived in my expectations, meeting with nothing le&s;&s;e then what the title promi&s;ed; <HI>Never having beheld a Publik Inteligencer, more abounding in lyes, non&s;ence, contradictions, or Li|bells, &s;uch as in your parts you now terme, Astrologicall Predictions; belching out Slanders, and invectives, again&s;t a King and Kingdome; then this pretended true relation doth.</HI></P>
<P>Werefore, give me leave, Sir to exammine &s;ome partes there|of, And in the fir&s;t place <HI>o ob&s;erve, with how little truth, and rea&s;on the Author accu&s;es the King, and Kingdome of Denmark, for having injuriou&s;ly provocked the King of Sweden; and whether or no the Danes did perfideou&s;ly make an irruption into the Swedi&s;h territories, with|out any cau&s;e given.</HI></P>
<P>Which that it may the more evidently appear to be <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> to your &s;elf, and to &s;uch as you &s;hall find not &s;ufficiently informed, of the trurh of the&s;e proceedings, I &s;hall in a percur&s;ory way, hint unto you the &s;everal breaches of the articles of former Treaties, by the Swedes, on which no &s;atisfaction being obtained, though ne|ver &s;o often pre&s;&s;ed, and earne&s;tly demanded; might ju&s;tly move his <HI>Maje&s;tie of Denmark,</HI> to &s;eek that reparation, by force of armes, which was denyed him, and his Mini&s;ters, by way of amicable treaties, and will con&s;equently prove, <HI>that his Maje&s;tie of Denmarks taking up of armes again&s;t the Swedes, was on a ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, and there fore no injurious provocation; per&s;idious Irruption, nor groundle&s;&s;e at|tempt.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e following articles, of the Treatyes of <HI>Bremsbroe, Mun&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Stetin,</HI> were infringed by the Swedes, If you ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by vertue of the 8 article of the treaty of peace conclud|ed between the two Crowns of <HI>Denmark, and Sweden, at Bremsbroe,</HI> the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Bremen (now King of Denmark) being compre|hended
<PB N="4" REF="4"> therein, was to treate with <HI>Sweden,</HI> about the re&s;titution of the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hopprick of Bremen,</HI> which was promi&s;ed him, but when his <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors arrived at Stockholm,</HI> they were not only derided and &s;ent away, <HI>re infecta,</HI> but moreover his <HI>Highne&s;s the Arch-Bi&s;hops place of Re&s;idence, the Ca&s;tle of Bremerverde,</HI> was by the <HI>Swedi&s;h forces, under the command of Generall Koning&s;mark,</HI> be&s;ieged, and taken, together with all what was therein.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it was agreed on, in the 25 article of the &s;aid treaty, that all the <HI>Lands in Norway</HI> taken by the <HI>Swedi&s;h forces,</HI> &s;hould be re&s;tored to the <HI>Crown of Denmark,</HI> except <HI>Jempterland, and Heren|dale,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Swedes till this day, could never re|&s;olve to accompli&s;h this article, by the re&s;toring of the two Pari&s;hes <HI>Irn, and Zern,</HI> belonging to <HI>Agger&s;hu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That his <HI>Maje&s;ties tolls in the Sound,</HI> have been defrauded of va&s;t, and eminent &s;ummes of money, by the <HI>Swedi&s;h Ministers,</HI> re&s;iding there, who granted their <HI>Certificates and pa&s;&s;es</HI> to every one, of what nation &s;oever, that demanded them, &s;o they would but part with &s;ome gratuity to the &s;aid <HI>Mini&s;ters, and their Servants,</HI> as it hath been proved to them; and can bee Evidenced to all the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>Corfitz, Ulefelt,</HI> formerly <HI>Rixhof-Ma&s;ter, or Lord High Steward,</HI> and &s;ince <HI>a Rebel to his King, and Country,</HI> was not only, kindely received, and honourably entertained in the <HI>Swedi&s;h Court</HI> but that moreover, <HI>the Queen Chri&s;tina of Sweden,</HI> would take upon her&s;elf to be a Judge, and oblige his <HI>Maje&s;tie of Denmark, in the per|&s;on of his Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> to plead his cau&s;e, in her pre&s;ence again&s;t his own undutyfull Subjects; Contrary to the <HI>Treaty of Stetin,</HI> conclud|ed in the Year 1570, as al&s;o again&s;t that of Bremsbroe, in the year 1645 by the 22. articles.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>Swedes</HI> have &s;ollicited the Haunce Towns, to con|curre with them, in the ruining and de&s;troying of the Commerce of the <HI>Kingdome of Denmarke.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. That they intermedled in the differences ari&s;en between the <HI>King of Denmark,</HI> and his <HI>Kin&s;man the Duke of Gottorp,</HI> as if they could not have been commpo&s;ed in an amicable manner, or by the ordinary way of Law, <HI>without their promi&s;ing him their forces;</HI> where|by they made him neglect his <HI>Maje&s;ties freind&s;hip,</HI> and &s;uch peace|able
<PB N="5" REF="4"> thoughts, as might have conduced to the mutuall good of both parties.</P>
<P N="7">7. That they began <HI>to di&s;pute the King of Denmark, his undoubted Rights, and Title, unto the Dukedome of Ditmars, and the County of Delmhor&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That they Marched with their forces through the <HI>Dukedomes of Hol&s;tein, County of Pinnenbergh, and the province of Jutland,</HI> to the great prejudice and detriment of the Inbabitants, without his Ma|je&s;ties permi&s;ion, <HI>and contrary to the treaty of peace at Munster.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. That the <HI>Inhabitants of the province of Halland,</HI> were by them deprived of their priviledges, contrary to the 27 <HI>Article</HI> of the Treaty of <HI>Brem&s;ebroe.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. That the <HI>Lands in the I&s;lands Rugen,</HI> called <HI>Ralsweigh,</HI> and tho&s;e whom his Maje&s;tie had inve&s;ted therewith, who&s;e <HI>Protector he is</HI> being engaged to maintan them, in their freedomes and priviledges, were neverthele&s;&s;e burthened by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> with taxes and extor|tions; Contrary to the u&s;uall cu&s;tomes, and to their former Li|berties.</P>
<P N="11">11. That they ob&s;erved not the 24 <HI>article</HI> of the afore mentioned <HI>treaty of Bremsbroe,</HI> concerning <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and the liberty of trade between his Maje&s;ties Subjects, and that Citty, and that they took &s;ome, and Mole&s;ted others of the <HI>Dani&s;h Ships,</HI> going to, or com|ming from <HI>Danzick,</HI> befor ever they had any Ships, much le&s;&s;e a Fleet before that Citty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides many other grievances, whereon his Maje&s;tie never|thele&s;&s;e endeavoured to obtain &s;atisfaction by fair means, but the <HI>Swedi&s;h Re&s;ident Durel,</HI> who was then at <HI>Coppenhaghen,</HI> for the com|po&s;ing, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of tho&s;e differences, <HI>in lieu of giving &s;atis|faction to the King, returned nothing, &s;ave threatening Language, broak of his negotiation, and went his wayes.</HI></P>
<P>Judg you therefore, whether any one can be &s;o greata Stranger to the&s;e truths, as not to di&s;cern, <HI>that the penner of the Swedi&s;h pre|tended true Relation, is an horrid vile Impo&s;ture. And whether his Ma|je&s;tie of Denmark could promi&s;e him&s;elf any other &s;atisfaction, &s;ave &s;uch a one as his Father Chri&s;tian the</HI> 4th <HI>of everla&s;ting memorie, received from them in the Year</HI> 43? <HI>and whether his Maje&s;tie had no ju&s;t cau&s;e given
<PB N="6" REF="5"> him, to betake him&s;elf to his armes, not only thereby to obtain &s;atisfaction for the wrongs he had already &s;ustained, but al&s;o to defend him&s;elf, and his Kingdoms, again&s;t tho&s;e who threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ned to deal far wor&s;e by him. And yet for all this his Majestie did not perfideou&s;ly make u&s;e of his Forces, as your writer is plea&s;ed to affirm, but declared, and proclaimed an open warr again&s;t the King, and Kingdom of Sweden, on their fronteirs, ac|cording to the Knowen Maximes of War: Nor did his Majestie of Denmark, under a coulor of Freind&s;hip, and on a pretence of embarking his army for Porru&s;&s;ia, or &s;ome other place, invade the Territotories of an Allye, with whom he was but newly entred into a Leauge of freind&s;hip; Neither did he unawares fall upon a Prince, unto whom Neutrality was fir&s;t granted, and afterwards &s;old: Far le&s;&s;e did he ever attempt, and invade another Kingdome, which begged for peace, having no other caw&s;e &s;o to do, &s;ave onely that it was already oppre&s;t by &s;everall barbarous Na|tions, taking it for granted, to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on and opportunity to over|runn, and conquer the &s;ame.</HI> Though others have done it, who there|fore better de&s;erve &s;uch Titles, as your writer be&s;toweth upon the <HI>King of Denmark, and the Dani&s;h Nation, without &s;o much as &s;crupuling the Unlawfulne&s;s of uttering them, again&s;t Crowned Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much as to the Title, and injurious Terms of the Book; and for the matters it containeth, though &s;ome of them are true, yet you will finde they are alleadged to little or no purpo&s;e, or in a wrong &s;en&s;e, as I have already &s;hewed you he did in the very Title: but for the mo&s;t part, you will finde them to be <HI>meerly fal&s;e,</HI> as you may ea&s;ily di&s;cover, by reading the <HI>Dani&s;h Relation,</HI> and ob|&s;erving the manifold Contradictions of <HI>his own.</HI> Some points where|of I intend only to touch upon; for &s;hould I go about to canva&s;s them all, I &s;hould exceed the form of a Letter.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place therefore, the Swedi&s;h Relator &s;ayeth, <HI>That the whole Kingdom of Denmark, the King, Queen, the rest of the Royal Court, the Senators, and the Nobility, were in a &s;hort time reduced un|der his (the King of Swedens) power and mercy;</HI> at &s;uch a time when as he had but one &s;trong place in the whole Kingdom, to wit, <HI>Fre|dericks Odde;</HI> in lieu whereof the <HI>King of Denmark his Forces in Norway</HI> had taken &s;everal &s;trong Holds of his, on the borders of Sweden, 'Tis true, <HI>he had overrun the Dani&s;h I&s;lands;</HI> but theforere
<PB N="7" REF="5"> all was not lo&s;t: <HI>and might not the King of Sweden have been driven out of them, as well as he was out of Poland?</HI> where he had al&s;o a footing in the Country; be&s;ides many con&s;iderable places, as <HI>Cra|cow, War&s;how, Lublin,</HI> and others; in which Kingdom he hath not at pre&s;ent, &s;o much as one foot of ground? no more had he, at that time we &s;peak of, in the <HI>two &s;trongest Provinces of Denmark, Shonen and Blecking:</HI> Neither was the King of Denmark with his Queen, &amp;c. at that time as yet in his power, or at his mercy. Howbeit he as then perhaps, made his reckoning without his Ho&s;t, as well as he did this la&s;t time, when as he promi&s;ed his people about him, that at <HI>Coppenhaghen</HI> they &s;hould finde, both Doars and Windows open to receive them; but when this proved otherwi&s;e, <HI>then Coppenhagben was to be taken by force of Arms, and the King of Den|mark, with his whole Royal Progenie, were to be &s;ent Pri&s;eners to Stock|holm, with the &s;ame Ceremonies, as have &s;ince been u&s;ed in the &s;ending of the Duke of Curland, with his Lady, and Children, to Riga:</HI> But when this would not do neither, <HI>then Coppenhaghen was te be reduced to a&s;hes:</HI> But God be thanked, it hath not been in the Swedi&s;h power to effect this neither; whereby you may &s;ee how doubtful it was, whether the King, Queen, and the Dani&s;h Court, were at that time your Writer alledgeth, in the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> power, and at his mercy; which if it had been &s;o, doubtle&s;s he would not have &s;pared them. Thus much I can tell you, that at that very time there were in <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> be&s;ides the Citizens, 5000 <HI>hor&s;e and foot,</HI> and between 2 <HI>or</HI> 3000 <HI>Seamen.</HI></P>
<P>But you may object, they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with terrour; 'tis very likely they were &s;o; and do you not think they were &s;o likewi&s;e this la&s;t time? when as they found the <HI>Swedi&s;h Army</HI> before the Gates of the City, and moreover, <HI>a Royal Swedi&s;h Fleet</HI> before their harbour, mo&s;t unexpectedly, at &s;uch a time, when as they never drea|med of an Enemy, untill they &s;aw him at their very Walls? after their Army was partly disbanded, and partly delivered to the Swedes, as well as all the &s;trong places in <HI>Shonen</HI> and <HI>Bleiking,</HI> accor|ding to agreement; from whence in former times they might have received ayde and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet when they perceived that none of his Maje&s;ties proffers to the <HI>King of Sweden</HI> were accepted, and

<P>To this the <HI>Swedes</HI> may happily object, that their intentions were only <HI>to have amu&s;ed the Hollanders for a while,</HI> till they met with a fit opportunity to put their politick de&s;igns in practice again&s;t them, as they had done again&s;t <HI>Poland,,</HI> have &s;ince done again&s;t <HI>Denma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> and lately al&s;o again&s;t <HI>Curland.</HI> And although I mu&s;t confe&s;s their &s;aid de&s;ign hath &s;ince in part been manife&s;ted, yet the <HI>King of Den|mark</HI> could as then, no more fore&s;ee the &s;ame, than his own, and his Kingdoms approaching danger, which was both of greater concern|ment to him, and likewi&s;e nearer at hand, ro be attempted.</P>
<P>But put the ca&s;e the <HI>Danes</HI> had as good a faculty as the Swedes do attribute unto them&s;elves, to di&s;cern the very intimate&s;t and mo&s;t hidden intention of their Neighbours, and thereby could have di&s;covered, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> were at &s;o great a di&s;tance with the <HI>Uni|ted Provinces,</HI> as your Writer &s;eems to infer; yet cannot I find, <HI>that the corre&s;pondencie between his Maje&s;tie of Denmark and them, or the Letters of the Amba&s;&s;ador Van Buninguen</HI> (which have been annexed

But this I dare &s;ay, that <HI>England</HI> will do much for the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, whereof the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is the Promoter: At which Allegation of the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> being the Promoter of the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e, I could no longer contain, but freely asked my Friend, Whether he thought the Prote&s;tant Religion ever had had a greater Enemy than the King of <HI>Sweden?</HI> &s;ince the Rebels in <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor the Papi&s;hes in the valleys of <HI>Piedmond</HI> had not &s;pilt &s;o much innocent Prote&s;tant blood in all their Ma&s;&s;acres, as the &s;aid King had done; who di&s;-in|abled and weakned all Prote&s;tant Princes, in &s;uch an unheard of manner, as that tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> may totally extirpate them when&s;oever they plea&s;e, which doubtle&s;s they will not omit to do, as &s;oon as they &s;hall meet with an opportunity to effect the &s;ame, e&s;pecially when as they &s;hall under&s;tand, we are &s;o far from condem|ning it, as that we hold it for a Prote&s;tant Maxime, That un|der the pretence of advancing our Religion, we may u&s;urp our Neighbours po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; as if God had given us but nine Com|mandements, whereas they have ten.</P>
<P>Re&s;t your &s;elf &s;atisfied an&s;wered my Friend, what I have alled|ged, is but by way of di&s;cour&s;e, and to give you part of what I have often heard by &s;uch, as were great <HI>Sticklers</HI> and <HI>Abettors</HI> of the Swe|di&s;h party, for I would not have you to believe, that we are &s;uch <HI>Cin|nicks,</HI> as to &s;uffer our &s;elves to be per&s;waded, <HI>That the ruining and de&s;troying of the Kingdome of Denmark, Poru&s;&s;ia, Curland, and the Ter|ritories of the Prince Elector of Brandenbourg, the en&s;laving of the City of Bremen (the &s;ole among&s;t all the Hans, and free Imperial
<PB N="17" REF="10"> Townes, which as we, does profe&s;&s;e the true Reformed Religion) can or may advance the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e.</HI> And to tell you the truth, we are not a little di&s;plea&s;ed, that the <HI>King of Sweden</HI> did not rather im|ploy his victorious Forces again&s;t &s;ome other Parts, <HI>then again&s;t Den|mark.</HI> But &s;ince he is engaged in that undertaking, and that he hath &s;o many enemies to bukcle with, and among&s;t the re&s;t the <HI>Im|perial Forces,</HI> we conceive, we cannot well abandon him, without the giving of an opportunity unto the <HI>Emperor,</HI> to &s;end a con&s;idera|ble relief unto the <HI>King of Spain,</HI> into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to overwhelm our Conque&s;ts there; <HI>which by the Swedes at London, is a&s;&s;ured to be the pre&s;ent Emperors de&s;ign, as &s;oon as the Swedi&s;h Army &s;hall have received the least foil, and that the re&s;t of the Allyes &s;hall be in a condition to op|po&s;e their proceedings, with their own Forces, without the standing in need of the Emperors Ayde.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon I demanded of my Friend whether or no that were his Highne&s;&s;e the <HI>Lord Protectors,</HI> and the <HI>Councells</HI> opinion? How would you have me to know that, &s;aid he, who am but a private Per&s;on, and bear no Publick Charge, or Office, in my Country? and where the Affaires of State are carried on with &s;o admirable a conduct and &s;ecrecy, as that we cannot affirm any thing, till we &s;ee it effected; what I have told you is but my bare opinion, and the &s;ence of tho&s;e who dive no deeper into the Publick State of Affaires then my &s;elf. I really believe you, &s;aid I, <HI>For in ca&s;e your opinion twere admitted of in your Country; you needed but to give the Kingdomes of Denmark, and Norway, to the King of Sweden; (who being more|over Master of all the Baltick Sea, two or three places only excepted;) and therby the State of Great Brittane would be expo&s;ed unto the &s;ame dan|ger, wherein it was formerly, when tho&s;e three Kingdomes were under the Dominion of one &s;ole Potentate; who notwith&s;tanding had not the Sea-Ports of the Baltick Sea, which are, worth at lea&s;t another Kingdome;</HI> And all this by the meer apprehen&s;ion which it plea&s;eth the <HI>Swedes</HI> to infu&s;e into you; <HI>that the Emperor will afford the King of Spain Forces and Relief;</HI> whereby you might be &s;aid, to immitate the Skit|ti&s;h hor&s;e, whieh being frightned, and &s;tartting at a &s;haddow, leaps out of the path, and puts out one of his eyes.</P>

<P>Wherunto my friend replyed, that he found my Rea&s;ons and Al|legations were well grounded, a&s;&s;uring me that <HI>the raynes of the State, where you are, were at pre&s;ent in the hands of &s;o &s;agacious a Prince, as would not be induced to neglect the providing for the good, tranquillity and &s;ecurity of tho&s;e E&s;tates, wherewithal the All-mighty hath intru&s;ted him.

<P>In the like manner the &s;aid Swedi&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors did in their &s;aid additional Declaration in&s;ert, that whereas in the Treaty of Pacification the <HI>Lord&s;hip of Druntheim</HI> was re&s;igned and yielded to the <HI>Crown of Sweden,</HI> &s;o in like manner it was to be under&s;tood, that the <HI>Bi&s;hops Sea Druntheim</HI> was al&s;o thereby re&s;igned and yielded up, which neverthele&s;s doth oppugn and contradict the true meaning and right Sence of the &s;ixt Article of the In&s;trument of Peace, an|nexed and marked with the Letter F. in which there is not &s;o much <MILESTONE N="F"> as a word to be found, intimating the yielding up of the <HI>Bi&s;hops Sea of Druntheim:</HI> but on the part of the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> it was more then &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated, that <HI>the Bi&s;hops Sea of Drun|theim</HI> had no dependancy on the Lord&s;hip, being &s;eparated from the &s;ame.

<P>And they failed &s;o little: by their pretending to include this Territory within the &s;aid Dominion: of the inlarging of the Li|mits to a greater extent, then they formerly were known to be, as that they named tho&s;e Territories, which are &s;ituated in the <HI>Drunthimer Bi&s;hops Sea, the Nordlanden,</HI> and would comprize them therein as an Appurtenance belonging to the &s;ame.

<P>In&s;omuch that during the &s;aid <HI>Negotiations</HI> there was nothing more common to the Swedes then this, to wit, when they had made an unrea&s;onable and har&s;h demand: which the Danes were forced to grant, to avoid the greater evil of the two: they then would advance and propo&s;e another demand as unrea&s;onable as the former, if not far wor&s;e: And then for their la&s;t argument and rea&s;on of &s;uch their unju&s;t demands; in which they would not be contradicted or gain&s;ayed: they declared, <HI>That the For|tre&s;&s;e of Frederichs Odde &s;hould not be delivered up, nor the Swedi&s;h Army be drawen out of the King of Denmarks, Territories, until &s;uch time as they had con&s;ented to all their demands.</HI></P>

<P>Whereupon <HI>the King of Denmark</HI> repre&s;ented to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that this their la&s;t demand was impo&s;&s;ible to be performed, by rea&s;on that <HI>the Crown of Denmark</HI> in that conjuncture of time, (as long as the Swedi&s;h Forces were not withdrawn out of his Territories) had not &s;o much credit; And although his Maje&s;tie of Denmark would have engaged him&s;elf to have &s;een the &s;ame performed, thereby to have freed His Dominions from the intollerable burden of the Military extor&s;ions, yet there would no ear at all be given thereunto. However, to the end it might not be &s;aid, that the King of Denmark had omitted any thing (though never &s;o difficult, were it in his power to performe the &s;ame) which might tend to the good of his Dominions, and of his Subjects, did finally proffer unto the Swedi&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors, his own and his Senators Bond for the payment of the &s;aid 400000 Rixdollers, be&s;ides &s;ome con&s;i|derable Territories, whereof they were to enjoy the Revenues, in ca&s;e the &s;aid payment &s;hould not be made in due time, and un till &s;uch time, as the <HI>Ca&s;tels in Guineae</HI> &s;hould be re&s;tored, hoping that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would have therewith remained &s;atisfied, and would have given order for the withdrawing of his forces out of the King of Denmarks Dominions, according unto the agreement of the Treaty of Peace, and the which was &s;o often with infalli|ble engagements promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But there was nothing at all concluded nor performed hereon, &s;ave only that one of the Swedi&s;h <HI>Plenipotentiary Amba&s;&s;adors, Peter Julius Cojet</HI> (who till that time had remained here) departed with the &s;aid re&s;olutions from hence to Hol&s;tein, with an intent to make a verbal relation of all the &s;aid Proceedings to the King his Ma&s;ter, promi&s;ing that he would both contribute to facilitate the de&s;ired marching away of the Swedi&s;h Forces, and that within a fortnight he would return again; comporting him&s;elf in &s;uch a

<P>Now when as in this wi&s;e entire, full, and more then compleat &s;atisfaction had been given to the King of Sweden, even to his mo&s;t unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable demands, that all the Countreyes and &s;trong places (agreed on in the Articles of the treaty of Peace) were delivered up, the <HI>Ca&s;tle of Bremerveurde</HI> re&s;tored, and that the evacuation and reciprocal &s;urrendring of the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Funen,</HI> and the &s;trong place of <HI>Fredericks Odde</HI> was expected, and the which ought to have been yielded up by the Swedes, at the &s;ame time as <HI>Bremerford</HI> was by the <HI>King of Denmark,</HI> the rather in re|gard thar the afore&s;aid <HI>Swedi&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> had &s;howen unto the <HI>Senators of the King of Denmark,</HI> an Original Letter from the King of Sweden containing this particular among others. <HI>As &s;oon as Bre|merford &s;hall be re&s;tored to us, the I&s;land of Funen &s;hall al&s;o be evacua|ted and cleared.</HI> But it &s;eems the Sweeds were otherwi&s;e minded, and re&s;olved, as the event &s;ufficiently manife&s;ts.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Major Generall.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your &s;econd letter dated ye&s;terday, wherein you do urge the delivery of 560 hor&s;e, and whereunto the annexed letter dated at Gottorp doth relate: I doe very much wonder how
<PB N="39" REF="30"> you can make your account upon 560 hor&s;e, whereas in your for|mer three letters, you do only &s;ay, that you had order to receive but 400 hor&s;e, of the 1000, which remained to be delivered unto the King of Sweden. And the rather becau&s;e the King my Ma&s;ter hath written unto me, that the King of Sweden was content to re|ceive the 1000 remaining hor&s;e in two regiments under the com|mand of Colonel Guldenleew, to wit: 500 of them in Jutland, of Colonell Brokenhu&s;ens Regiment, and the remaining 500 in Hol|&s;tein, That Lieutenant Generall Horn &s;hould receive tho&s;e in Jut|land, and your &s;elf tho&s;e in Hol&s;tein, and therewith to remain &s;a|tisfied, which ought accordingly to &s;tand good. I have likewi&s;e &s;een by the &s;aid annexed Paper, That the Major Generall is requi|red, to demand a &s;pecification concerning tho&s;e hor&s;e which are to be delivered about the parts of Gluck&s;tadt, as that they &s;hould be all Germain Souldiers and no Danes, nor no Patcht nor ragged men to be &s;lipt in among&s;t them, but that they might be good men, well mounted, again&s;t which there might be no exceptions to be taken; Now whereas there are no hor&s;e to be delivered by tho&s;e of Gluck|&s;tadt, but by his Maje&s;tie the King of Denmark my Ma&s;ter, I attri|bute it to the zeale of the indicture, who rather cho&s;e to mention tho&s;e of Gluck&s;tadt, then to nominate the King my Ma&s;ter. As for my &s;elf I was not borne at Gluck&s;tadt, however they are hone&s;t men; Nor am I &s;o great a &s;tranger to the world, as that my name &s;hould be unknown: And as concerning the Souldry that they &s;hould be no Danes but Germains, and e&s;pecially well hors'd, I do returne this an&s;wer, that I doubt not but the King of Sweden as be|ing well ver'&s;t in the military di&s;cipline, and by rea&s;on thereof be|come famous, will in height of di&s;cretion be &s;atisfied with the de|livery of 500 &s;uch hor&s;e, as &s;hall be furni&s;hed with &s;utable arms, &s;uch as may be warrantable and pa&s;&s;able in an armie. In reference whereunto I &s;hall punctually obey my King and Ma&s;ters command, and am ready to deliver the &s;aid 500 hor&s;e. Moreover I cannot conceive that there hath been occa&s;ion given to treat the whole Da|ni&s;h Nation, amid&s;t whom there are as hone&s;t men, as among&s;t other Nations, and unto who&s;e King I am engaged by oath, with &s;uch &s;cornfull language, as if there were occa&s;ion to &s;huffell them
<PB N="40" REF="31"> in among&s;t the re&s;t of the men, and not to produce and proffer them in a publick way: Nor can I perceive by the King of Swedens in|&s;tructions to the Auditor Generall, that he &s;tands upon &s;uch har&s;h formalities. And as Colonel Guldenlow cannot be in two places at once, I mu&s;t therefore redemand him back again, and I will by an expre&s;&s;e &s;end you word by the fir&s;t, on what day the &s;aid de&s;ired 500 hor&s;e &s;hall be delivered. Thus much I thought good to returne you by way of an&s;wer, committing you to God, remaining, &amp;c. Gluck&s;tadt the 7 of July 1658. P. S. In ca&s;e it plea&s;eth the Major Generall the delivery of the &s;aid Regiment can be performed with|out delay again&s;t Monday next.</P>

<P>Worthy, Tru&s;ty, and well beloved: We doubt not but that even in England, all men are of opinion, that in reference unto the late Treaty the withdrawing of the Swedi&s;h army out of our Terri|tories &s;hould have been performed on the fir&s;t day of the Moneth of May la&s;t pa&s;t, according unto the contents of the articles of Peace. But whereas they as yet continue, and do remain in our Lands and Territories, to their utter de&s;olation, It may be tho&s;e who are not acquainted with the true cau&s;es thereof, may impute the rea&s;ons of the &s;aid delayes to us; wherefore we have thought fit|ting to give you an ample information thereon, by the annexed Papers. To the end, that you may withall po&s;&s;ible &s;peed make your addre&s;&s;es to his Highne&s;&s;e the Lord Protector, that the late Peace made between us, and the King of Sweden on the Publick faith, and by the Meditation of the Lord Protector may be ob&s;erv|ed and performed, and that our poor &s;ubjects (who are exhau&s;ted to the la&s;t farthing) may not any more be oppre&s;&s;ed with contri|butions and exactions. But that the &s;oulderie may be &s;o far drawn off out of our Dominions, as that our Subjects and our &s;elves may enjoy the fruits of the &s;aid Peace, &s;ince even in the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t flames of war, our oppre&s;&s;ions were not &s;o great nor bur|den&s;ome, as they are at pre&s;ent, &s;eeing on our parts we have fully
<PB N="43" REF="32"> complied with all tho&s;e particulars, which are contained in the Treaty and articles of Peace concluded on at Ro&s;chilt, by the deli|very up of the Provinces of Shonen and Bleking, with all the &s;trong places therein, the Domains of Bahuz, and Druntheim (both which Territories contain the half of the limits of our Kingdome of Nor|way) having evacuated and quitted the fortre&s;&s;es of Bremerfeurde having delivered in the 2000 hor&s;e, having &s;atisfied and given full content to Duke Fredrike of Sle&s;wigh, Hol&s;tein, and Gottorp, hav|ing made re&s;titution of the Salt &s;hips and of all their lodings, and be&s;ides have fully complyed on our behalfs, with all whar&s;oever was comprized, and contained, in the articles of Peace, which were made <HI>Rot&s;chilt;</HI> Over and above which we have remitted un|to the King of Sweden, the I&s;le of <HI>Ween,</HI> although the &s;ame doth not at all belong unto the <HI>Province of Shonen,</HI> only for Peace, and quietne&s;&s;e &s;ake, whereas to the contrary on the behalf of the King of Sweden, the I&s;les of <HI>Fumen, and Langland, all Jutland,</HI> with the principalities of <HI>Sle&s;wigh,</HI> and <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> have not been re&s;tored to us, but are at this very pre&s;ent time, mo&s;t heavily and &s;adly oppre&s;&s;ed, and burthened by the whole body of the Swedi&s;h <HI>Fieldarmy,</HI> where|by &s;everall of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid parts have been con&s;train|ed to de&s;ert their habitations, and livings, and to let them run to ruine, and tho&s;e who are remained in their &s;aid dwellings, are rea|dy to de&s;pair, and mu&s;t fall under the heavy oppre&s;&s;ions, and bur|thens of the war, &s;o that we cannot as yet imagine, what the end hereof will prove, nor what the i&s;&s;ue will be, unle&s;&s;e the highly valued authority and interpo&s;ition of the Lord Protector (by who&s;e mediation the Peace was made, and upon who&s;e warrant we were willing to comply with the &s;ame) do induce tde King of Sweden to harbour other thoughts, and to quit our Dominions. And in ca&s;e on the &s;wedi&s;h behalf it &s;hould be objected that the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e concerning the <HI>Guine a-booty,</HI> is not yet concluded; however we have profered that &s;atisfaction thereon, which was beyond rea&s;on, or equity to be demanded, or expected, notwith&s;tanding the Swedes have not made an end thereof, either of, or on, wherefore they are not to be excu&s;ed in letting this whole Army lye thus hea|vy upon us, after the ratification of Peace, de&s;poyling our Domi|nions
<PB N="44" REF="33"> to the uttermo&s;t. and beyond all &s;ence, or con&s;iderations, be|reaving us of all our powers, incommings, and revenews. It is there|fore our ab&s;olute will and plea&s;ure, 1. that you make your earne&s;t addre&s;&s;e to the Lord Protector, and move him, as well by his let|ters as amba&s;&s;adors, to obtain from the King of Sweden, that with|out any further delayes his Armies may be drawn of out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Kingdoms, according unto equity and rea&s;on, and in reference to the contents of the late Articles of agreement, which we do pro|mi&s;e our &s;elves, and do expect an undoubted an&s;wer hereunto, and remain, with the continuance of our Kingly favour towards you, &amp;c.

<P><HI>FRederick</HI> the Third, &amp;c.
