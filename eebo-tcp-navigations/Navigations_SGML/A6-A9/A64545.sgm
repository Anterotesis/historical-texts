<HEAD>The Voyage from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce the time the King &s;etled a Royal Aca|demy at <HI>Paris,</HI> for improving Arts and Sciences within his Kingdom, the Mem|bers that compo&s;e it, have not hit upon any means more proper for accompli&s;hing that De&s;ign, than the &s;ending out of Learned Men to make Ob&s;ervations in foreign Countries, whereby they might correct the Geographical Maps, facilitate Navigation, and rai&s;e A&s;trono|my to its Perfection. In that Pro&s;pect, not a few of the Learned&s;t Men of that Illu&s;trious So|ciety,
<PB REF="5"> were, by his Maje&s;ties Orders, &s;ent into &s;everal Kingdoms: Some went into <HI>Denmark,</HI> o|thers to <HI>England;</HI> &s;ome were &s;ent to the I&s;le of <HI>Cayana,</HI> and other I&s;les of <HI>America, Cape Verd,</HI> nay, and to the chief Ports and Coa&s;ts of the King|dom, whil&s;t others in the Ob&s;ervatory at Home, kept pace, and entertained all nece&s;&s;ary Corre|&s;pondencies with them.</P>
<P>It was de&s;ired that an Occa&s;ion might offer of &s;ending more Ob&s;ervators into &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the I&s;le of <HI>Foroy,</HI> where they have fix|ed the fir&s;t Meridian, the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and chiefly into <HI>China,</HI> where it was known that Arts had flouri&s;hed for the&s;e four thou&s;and years, where there are Books upon all Subjects, and Libraries that may compare with the faire&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> from which the Kings Bibliothic might be en|riched.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Father parted from <HI>Macao, Decem|ber</HI> 5. 1681, in a Dutch Ship, and arrived in <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1682.</NOTE>This De&s;ire grew &s;tronger in the chief Mem|bers of the Academy, after they had conver&s;ed with Father <HI>Philip Couplet,</HI> a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit, who upon his Return from <HI>China,</HI> po&s;ted by <HI>Paris</HI> on his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> whither he was &s;ent about the Affairs of the Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marquis de Louvoy,</HI> Mini&s;ter and Secretary of State, who be&s;ides the Affairs of War, and Over&s;ight of the Kings Buildings, was likewi&s;e charged with the Concerns of Arts and Sciences, ordered, in his Maje&s;ties Name, the Members of the Royal Academy to draw up a Memoire of the mo&s;t remarkable things they de&s;ired to be in|formed of from <HI>China,</HI> to be given and recom|mended to Father <HI>Couplet,</HI> who was to return thi|ther the year following.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<P>The Duke of <HI>Mayne</HI> favoured al&s;o the De&s;ign with a great Zeal for Religion, and a Curio&s;i|ty &s;uitable to his Wit, calculated for Knowledg, and far above his years.</P>
<P>But the King &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all in Zeal for the Improvement of Arts and Sciences, e&s;pecially of &s;uch, which in tho&s;e Countries might mo&s;t con|tribute to the Growth of Religion, being af|fected with the Nece&s;&s;ity of Mi&s;&s;ions, was re|&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his Protection and Liberalities. He was informed by Father <HI>Cou|plet,</HI> that almo&s;t all the French Je&s;uits, who a|bove thirty years &s;ince went to <HI>China</HI> with Fa|ther <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> were dead, labour|ing in the Mi&s;&s;ions of that Kingdom; that there were but a very few Mi&s;&s;ionaries re|maining; that the Emperour, in the mean time, continued to them his Protection, and that in imitation of him, the Vice-Roys and Governours of Provinces were al&s;o very kind to them; and that in &s;hort, there was a great want of Go&s;pel-Labourers, not only for cul|tivating the Chri&s;tians, who are already very numerous there, but al&s;o for reaping the Fruit of the certain hopes, which at pre&s;ent more than ever, good men have of &s;preading the Faith in that va&s;t Empire. He had already gone &s;o far, as to a&s;&s;ign a con&s;iderable Sum of Mo|ney for the French Je&s;uits who were to accompany Father <HI>Couplet;</HI> and all the care was, how they might be &s;ent under his Ma|je&s;ties Authority, when Divine Providence pre&s;ented a mo&s;t favourable occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<P>Hardly was Father <HI>Couplet</HI> departed for <HI>Rome,</HI> when two <HI>Siam Mandarins,</HI> with a Prie&s;t of the Foreign Mi&s;&s;ions &s;etled in <HI>Siam</HI> named <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Vachet,</HI> arrived in <HI>France.</HI> They were &s;ent by the Mini&s;ters of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> to learn News of the Emba&s;&s;ie which the King their Ma&s;ter had &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, with magnificent Pre&s;ents, on board a Ship belong|ing to the Ea&s;t-India Company, called the <HI>Sun of the Ea&s;t,</HI> which was reported to have been ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty perceiving what Advances the King of <HI>Siam</HI> made in &s;eeking his Friend&s;hip, and that there was hopes be&s;ides he might turn Chri&s;tian, if there were an Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent to him, re&s;olved to do it; and by the &s;ame way &s;ends Je&s;uits into <HI>China,</HI> which hath a great com|merce with the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> from whence it is not above five or &s;ix hundred Leagues di&s;|&s;tant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King or|ders &s;ix Je|&s;uits, Mathe|maticians, to be &s;ent to <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>The King having thereupon declared his In|tentions to the <HI>Marques de Louvoy</HI> and Father <HI>de la Chaize,</HI> they forthwith demanded of our Supe|riors, four Fathers at lea&s;t, that might be capa|ble of labouring in con&s;ort with the Academy Royal, in the Improvement of Arts and Sciences, and at the &s;ame time employ them&s;elves with the Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>China</HI> in advancing the Chri&s;tian Religion; adding, that they mu&s;t needs be ready to depart within &s;ix weeks, in the Ship that was to carry the French Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>It was no hard matter for our Superiours to find men that were willing to contribute to the furthering of that de&s;ign. Among&s;t many who
<PB REF="6"> offered them&s;elves, &s;ix were cho&s;en, who, tho of different Provinces, were happily at that time in the Je&s;uits College at <HI>Paris;</HI> as if Di|vine Providence had only brought them together for obtaining a happine&s;s which they earne&s;tly longed for. The Superiour named to be over them was Father <HI>Fontenay,</HI> who for eight years pa&s;t taught the Mathematics in that College. The other five were, Father <HI>Gerbillon,</HI> Father <HI>l'Compte,</HI> Father <HI>Vi&s;delou,</HI> Father <HI>Couvet</HI> and my &s;elf.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the thing was re&s;olved upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prepara|tions for their departure.</NOTE> we had private notice given us, to prepare for our departure within two Months at farthe&s;t. Next day we went together to <HI>Mount-Martre</HI> to thank God by the Mediation of the Holy Virgin and Holy Martyrs, for the favour that was done us, and to Offer our &s;elves up to Je&s;us Chri&s;t more particularly in that place, where St. <HI>Igna|tius</HI> and his Companions made their fir&s;t Vows, and which is looked upon as the Cradle of the Society, that from its birth hath devoted it &s;elf in a mo&s;t particular manner to Foreign Mi&s;&s;ions. That's the rea&s;on that they who con&s;titute it, have ever &s;ince con&s;ecrated them&s;elves to that duty by a &s;olemn Vow; &s;o that every one think|ing him&s;elf in particular de&s;tiny'd to it, ought accordingly to prepare him&s;elf from his youth upward, by all the Exerci&s;es of Piety and Mor|tification, and by the &s;tudy of the Sciences and long Voyages that may mo&s;t fit him for it. And this is practi&s;ed with &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, that the &s;ame vigour of Spirit that was at fir&s;t may be &s;aid &s;till to be in the Order.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are ad|mitted into the Royal A|cademy of Sci|ences.</NOTE>The de&s;ign of our Voyage being made pub|lic at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Members of the Academy, who concerned them&s;elves mo&s;t in it, did us the Honour to admit us into that Society, by a particular Privilege; and we took our places there &s;ome days before our departure. The mo&s;t proper means for executing the Orders of the King were thought on, and it was re&s;olved that be&s;ides the In&s;tructions which the Marque&s;s of <HI>Louvoy</HI> had prepared, to be given to Father <HI>Coup|let,</HI> when he &s;hould return to <HI>China,</HI> and which was forthwith put into our hands, the chief Mem|bers of the Academy, &s;hould furni&s;h us with particular Memoirs relating to the Ob&s;ervations that might be proper to be made in <HI>China,</HI> and the things that were to be &s;ent home to <HI>France,</HI> as well for enriching the King's Library, as for the emprovement of Arts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers in&s;tru|ctions are gi|ven unto them for the improvement of Ats and Sciences.</NOTE>Every one of the&s;e Members took upon them|&s;elves to furni&s;h us with &s;uch as concerned the Arts and Sciences they were mo&s;t ver&s;ed in; and we thereupon had &s;everal Conferences with them. We agreed upon the A&s;tronomical Ob|&s;ervations that we &s;hould make in <HI>China</HI> and on our Voyage. They gave us the Tables of the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which have been made with &s;o great labour, and which at pre&s;ent &s;erve for determining the Longitudes of Places. They al|&s;o pre&s;ented us with &s;everal large <HI>Tele&s;copes</HI> of 12, 15, 18, 25, 50, and eighty Foot, whereof we were to leave &s;ome in the Ob&s;ervatory of <HI>Peguin.</HI> They imparted to us be&s;ides &s;everal Memoires in Natural Philo&s;ophy, Anatomy, and con|cerning Plants. There were Sea-Charts of the Cour&s;e we were to follow in the Kings Library,
<PB REF="7"> which had &s;erved in other Voyages, we had Copies of them given us, and they proved very u&s;eful to us in our Sailing. They gave us very good and ample in&s;tructions concerning Navi|gation, Architecture, and other Arts, concern|ing the Books that were to be &s;ent to <HI>France,</HI> and the Ob&s;ervations that it would be proper for us to make. In &s;hort, of all the Members of that Learned Academy, there was none who ap|peared not in that affair with particular zeal and application, &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of it would not a little contribute to the glory and &s;atisfaction of the King. All the&s;e Memoires being examined in &s;everal meetings of the Academy Royal, were given in to us before our departure. And the&s;e Gentlemen having promi&s;ed to communicate their Di&s;coveries to us, we engaged our &s;elves to &s;end them our Ob&s;ervations, to the end that acting in con&s;ort, and making but one Body of Academicians, &s;ome in <HI>France,</HI> and others in <HI>Chi|na,</HI> we might joyntly labour in the encrea&s;ing and improvement of Sciences, under the protection of &s;o great a Monarch.</P>
<P>In the mean time we were much taken up in preparing all the In&s;truments that were nece&s;&s;ary for us; and &s;eeing we were to leave <HI>Paris</HI> within a Month, we had made for us in that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The various In&s;truments they take with them for their Ob&s;er|vations.</NOTE> two Quadrants of ninety degrees, the one of eighteen inches the <HI>Radius,</HI> and the other of twenty &s;ix; three great <HI>Pendulums</HI> with Seconds, an In&s;tru|ment for finding out at the &s;ame time the right A&s;cen&s;ion and the Declination of Stars; an Equi|noctial Dial that marked the Hours to the very Minutes, having underneath a large Compa&s;s for finding out all hours of the day the declination of
<PB REF="8"> the Load-&s;tone. All the&s;e In&s;truments were to be made u&s;e of in A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>We had al&s;o two bows or half circles, divi|ded very exactly into &s;ix and &s;ix minutes, for Geometrical Operations, the one had only Sights, and the other Gla&s;&s;es. When we went to take our leave of the Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> he had the good|ne&s;s to give us a third and bigger, divided by three and three minutes, which he had made for his own u&s;e. We cannot &s;ufficiently acknowledge the obligations we have to that Prince for the good|ne&s;s he expre&s;t towards us on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Engines I have been mentioning, we carried with us two repetition-<HI>pendulum-Clocks,</HI> Burning-gla&s;&s;es of twelve, and twenty inches Di|ameter, Load-&s;tones, Micro&s;copes, &s;everal Ther|mometers and Barometers, all the Tubes and Machines that &s;erve in making experiments of vacuity, a Dial upon an inclining place, the two Machines of <HI>Romer,</HI> one of which repre&s;ents the motion of the Planets, and the other the Eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon. They gave us al&s;o for our u&s;e &s;everal Books out of the Kings Library.</P>
<P>In the mean time our Pen&s;ions were &s;etled by Orders from the King, who cau&s;ed al&s;o his Let|ters-Patents to be expeded for us, whereby his Maje&s;ty made us his Mathematicians in the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arrival of the <HI>Cheva|lier de Chau|mont</HI> at <HI>Brest.</HI></NOTE>We arrived at <HI>Bre&s;t, February</HI> 10. and &s;ome days after Orders came from Court to ha&s;ten our Embarquing, becau&s;e the Sea&s;on was already far &s;pent. They were obeyed with &s;o much dili|gence, that every thing almo&s;t was in a readine&s;s, when the <HI>Chevalier de Chaumont</HI> named by the King for the Emba&s;&s;ie of <HI>Siam</HI> arrived at <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"> This Gentleman well known in the Kingdom for his particular merit, and the Nobility of an ancient and Illu&s;trious Family, was in his youth bred up a <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> but God did him the Grace to Convert him and his Brothers one after another at different times. The la&s;t of all having for many years &s;erved in the Armies with the approbation of a brave Gentleman, and good Officer, being at length cloyed with the World, and de&s;irous to work out his own &s;alvation, put him&s;elf into our Society, where he lived and died like a Saint, having edified all that knew him by rare Exam|ples of all &s;orts of Virtues, and e&s;pecially of an heroick patience under the pains and trouble which he felt by the wounds that he had formerly recei|ved in the Wars. <HI>The Chevalier de Chaumont</HI> of whom we are now &s;peaking, was his elder Brother, at fir&s;t he &s;erved at Land, where his &s;ingular Merit made him known, and particularly beloved of the King whil&s;t he was but young. He was af|terwards &s;ent to <HI>Thoulon,</HI> there to command the Main-guards or <HI>Reformades,</HI> and to in&s;truct them in all Exerci&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for Gentlemen who are to Command his Maje&s;ties Ships. Since that he was made Captain of a Man of War, and Major General of the Kings Naval-Forces in the <HI>Levant.</HI> His zeal for his Princes Service hath nothing le&s;&s;en|ed his continual application to the &s;ervice of God; and all gave him his due when they looked upon him as a Man of &s;ingular Prudence and Piety. Therefore it was that his Maje&s;ty, who propo|&s;ed to him&s;elf chiefly the good of Religion, and the Conver&s;ion of the King of <HI>Siam</HI> by the Emba&s;&s;ie which he re&s;olved to &s;end to him, pitched upon the <HI>Chevalier de Thaumont</HI> for &s;o glo|rious
<PB N="10" REF="9"> an employment; being per&s;waded that the good examples which he would give in that Country, would be &s;o many proofs of the &s;anctity of Chri&s;tianity, that might fully convince that King of the truth of our Religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends the Je|&s;uits Patents of Mathema|ticians.</NOTE>Next day after he came we had the honour to &s;alute him in his Lodgings, and received from his hands the Patents which it plea&s;ed the King to give every one of us in particular, &s;ending us in quality of his Mathematicians into the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> They were Signed and Sealed with the Great Seal of yellow Wax, and conceived in the&s;e terms.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WIth great joy do I acquit my &s;elf of the Commands of the greate&s;t King in Chri&s;tendom, in addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to your Reverence, to recommend to you &s;ix of our Fathers his Subjects Men of extraordi|nary Merit and Capacity, that under your Prote|ction they may carry to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> the knowledg of the true Faith, and get from thence all the ob&s;ervations of A&s;tronomy, and all the knowledg of the Arts and Sciences of a Nation, for which the Reverend Father <HI>Philip Couplet,</HI> whom his Maje&s;ty had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee here, hath wrought in him a very particular e&s;teem. All the &s;ix be&s;ides a great zeal and rare virtue, have con|&s;iderable advantage as to Languages and Sciences, and the skill they have in the Mathematics, hath made his Maje&s;ty make choice of them for his Mathematicians, for which he hath given them all Letters Patents under the Great Seal of the Chancery. Your Reverence will have the &s;atis|faction, by means of the&s;e Fathers to contract a kind of Commerce, in favour of the Sciences, betwixt two of the mo&s;t powerful Sovereigns of the World, and the greate&s;t protectors of Scien|ces. There is &s;o great a re&s;emblance betwixt the Prudence and Happine&s;s of their Government, the &s;trength and number of their Armies, the oeco|nomy and good order of their States, the Ble&s;&s;ing God gives their undertakings, the Magnificence of their Courts, the greatne&s;s and noblene&s;s of their thoughts, that it would &s;eem tho&s;e two ad|mirable Princes finding nothing upon Earth &s;o Great and Augu&s;t as them&s;elves, and being both
<PB N="15" REF="11"> born for the Glory of their age, and the wellfare of their people, ought to be as much united by the &s;ame heroic virtues and qualities which they have received from Heaven, as they are &s;epera|ted by the va&s;t &s;pace of Seas and Land that di&s;|joyn their Territories on Earth, May the Su|preme Lord of all Kings and Emperors, who hath made them both the Defenders of the true Wor&s;hip of God, and Protectors of his Altars, give them al&s;o the &s;ame thoughts as to Religion, the &s;ame zeal for the propagation of the true Faith, and the &s;ame earne&s;tne&s;s in the publication and practice of the Go&s;pel, that the great Emperor of <HI>China</HI> may not be inferior to ours in that only e&s;|&s;ential point of true Grandeur, which is want|ing to the Dignity of his Per&s;on, and the Hap|pine&s;s of his Reign, all holy and zealous per&s;ons of this flouri&s;hing Kingdom, wherein <HI>Louis the Great</HI> does &s;edulou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;h the unity of the Catholic Faith, Virtue and Piety by his Exam|ples, his Cares, his Edicts and continual liberali|ties, ince&s;&s;antly beg of Heaven the &s;ame Grace for your great Emperor: We continually offer up our Prayers and Sacrifices to the true God for that. We cannot believe that &s;o many Virtues as he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, will be for ever without a reward, for want of the Virtues of Chri&s;tia|nity, with which we hope he will con&s;ummate that great Merit, which procures him &s;o fair a Reputation all over the Earth. I be&s;eech you <HI>R. F.</HI> that for the &s;atisfaction of our Great King, which God hath given to <HI>Europe</HI> for a defender and re&s;torer of the true Faith, and whom ac|cording to all Prophecies he de&s;igns for the de|&s;truction of Mahometi&s;m, you would &s;till give
<PB N="16" REF="12"> us the be&s;t information you can, of the Virtues, Sentiments and Actions of your great Emperour, for whom he hath already conceived &s;o particu|lar an e&s;teem. I likewi&s;e adjure you to Protect, A&s;|&s;i&s;t and Favour, as much as lies in your power, tho&s;e Zealous and Learned Mi&s;&s;ionaries whom he hath &s;ent you, and at who&s;e Head he has placed Father <HI>Fautenay,</HI> who&s;e merit you know, and who was looked upon by all the Learned Mathe|maticians of the Royal Academy of Scien|ces, that is here entertained by the Liberalities of his Maje&s;ty, as an extraordinary Man, and one that was an honour to their Nation. They bring you all the Ob&s;ervations and Curio&s;ities of the Sciences of <HI>Europe</HI> in their greate&s;t Perfection, and are &s;ent to you as pledges of other greater matters that his Maje&s;ty would do, and without doubt will do hereafter for the &s;atisfaction of your Great Monarch, and of your &s;elf in particular, &s;o &s;oon as he hath heard how his Mathematicians have been received and treated in <HI>China</HI> and what aids and a&s;&s;i&s;tances have been given them for put|ing in execution the orders that are enjoyned them. I cannot expre&s;s to your Reverence what advanta|geous con&s;equences I do pre&s;age from the &s;ending of the&s;e Fathers to you, if it plea&s;e God to give a Ble&s;&s;ing to it. Since they all &s;et out from Court, and the Capital City of this Realm, where they have been bred for &s;ome time, and highly con&s;i|dered for their Merit; they will acquaint you with many things that will content your zeal and curio&s;ity, better than <HI>I</HI> can relate them in writing, above all things I beg of your Reverence to be|lieve them, when they a&s;&s;ure you that no Man li|ving is more re&s;pectfully and more cordially than

<P>SOme days after they adju&s;ted the number of tho&s;e that were to go in the Ship with the Amba&s;&s;ador; Be&s;ides the Abbot of <HI>Choi&s;y</HI> who is well known in <HI>France</HI> by his Birth and Merit, and who was to continue with the King of <HI>Siam</HI> in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador until his Bapti&s;m, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be converted.

We are particularly obliged to him for his Civilities, and the good Offices he did us during our whole Voyage in &s;uch a manner as engages us to the highe&s;t acknowledgment; M. <HI>Coriton</HI> was our &s;econd Captain; we had two Lieutenants, M. <HI>de Forbin,</HI> and M. <HI>de Cibois,</HI> and an En&s;ign called M. <HI>de Chamorean.</HI></P>

Upon his entry the Ship &s;aluted him with thirteen Guns, and the Frigat with nine. The Compa|nies of both Ve&s;&s;els by their many reiterated <HI>Huz|za's,</HI> &s;hewed the joy they had to perform the Voyage under a Commander of &s;o great worth; all the day following was allowed for preparing to be gone.</P>

<P>As we put out of the Road of <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> we had a fair wind; but it failing us by that time we were got &s;even or eight Leagues from the Port, about
<PB N="19" REF="13"> noon we dropt Anchor, untill five or &s;ix a clock in the Evening that the wind blowing again from the &s;ame Corner, we again &s;et Sail.</P>

<P>From that time till within five or &s;ix Degrees of the Line, we had as good weather, and as favourable winds as we could have de&s;ired; Di|vine Providence taking plea&s;ure, it &s;eems, to fa|vour a Voyage undertaken for the &s;ake of Reli|gion, in a time when the mo&s;t expert Sea-Com|manders were of Opinion that we had let &s;lip the Sea&s;on proper for &s;etting out by three whole Weeks. We had at fir&s;t &s;o &s;trong a wind on Poop, that with a &s;ingle Sail abroad we made a|bove three&s;core Leagues in four and twenty hours. So that without any danger we doubled Cape <HI>&V;&s;han</HI> and Cape <HI>Fini&s;tere</HI> &s;o dreadful to our Sea|men, becau&s;e of the frequent Storms that ari&s;e a|bout tho&s;e places. The truth is, we found a very rough and rouling Sea there.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the eighth, at the heigth of Cape <HI>Fi|ni&s;tere,</HI> we &s;aw a Dutch Ve&s;&s;el &s;tanding in to the Channel of <HI>England</HI> which had been forced to lie by and drive becau&s;e of the contrary winds.

<P>They who have been at Sea well know how great trouble and &s;ickne&s;s Men endure, the fir&s;t time they meet with a rough Sea; but it is impo&s;|&s;ible

There pa&s;&s;ed no Sunday nor Holy-day whereon &s;e|veral did not participate of the Holy My&s;teries; This zeal was the effect of the good examples of my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, who communicated once every eight days with extraordinary Humility and Piety. Every Holy-day and Sunday before publick Ve&s;pers which were &s;ung with much De|votion, the &s;ecular and regular Churchmen by turns made a Sermon to the Ships Company. A Je&s;uit took the care upon him of Catechi&s;ing the Officers men, Soldiers, and Seamen, three times a week. That exerci&s;e was begun and ended by a Spiritual Hymn, &s;ung by two Seamen who had pretty good Voices, and all the re&s;t made an|&s;wer upon their knees about the Main-ma&s;t. The&s;e good examples, the&s;e regular in&s;tructions and exerci&s;es of Piety, be&s;ides the vi&s;iting of the Sick, and the &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tances that were given them &s;everal times aday, &s;o wrought upon the hearts of tho&s;e poor people, that there was none of them
<PB N="21" REF="14"> almo&s;t but that made a general Confe&s;&s;ion, and came to the Sacrament on the principal Holy|days.</P>
<P>Before we came to the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Zone.</NOTE> we had a little calm and much contrary wind, which made the Amba&s;&s;ador re&s;olve to have nine Ma&s;|&s;es &s;aid to the honour of the Holy Virgin, that by her interce&s;&s;ion we might obtain favourable weather, becau&s;e the heats which are commonly left in tho&s;e places, began to occa&s;ion many Di|&s;ea&s;es in the Ship.</P>
<P>One of the Je&s;uits laid hold on that occa&s;ion to introduce on Board a laudable cu&s;tom of &s;aying the Litanies of the mo&s;t Holy Virgin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devoti|on of the whole Ships Company to|wards the Ho|ly Virgin.</NOTE> which is practi&s;ed on Board the &s;hips that are Commanded by the <HI>Mare&s;hall D'E&s;tree:</HI> five or &s;ix Soldiers, and as many Sea-men divided into two Companies up|on the Poop and Fore-ca&s;tle began that Devotion a little before the fir&s;t watch was &s;et in the Even|ing, and within a few days, all were ready to joyn in it, &s;o that upon our return it was made, as it were, a publick exerci&s;e of Obligation, which was performed &s;o zealou&s;ly, that neither cold nor rain could hinder it.</P>

One and all of us envied the happy lot of the&s;e generous Defenders of the Catholic Faith, and would have been ravi&s;hed to have fini&s;hed our cour&s;e for &s;o Holy a Cau&s;e: but it is not ju&s;t to de&s;ire the Crown before one hath run the Race.

<P>According as we drew nearer and nearer to the Line, we took plea&s;ure to Ob&s;erve that as the Stars of the <HI>Artic</HI> Pole lowr'd the&s;e of the <HI>Antar|tic</HI> Pole were elevated over our heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maps of the South part of the Heavens are not exact.</NOTE> of all the new Stars which we di&s;covered to the <HI>South,</HI> we were at fir&s;t mo&s;t taken with tho&s;e of the <HI>Croziers,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e the chief four are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed that they make a kind of cro&s;s. The bigge&s;t of all is twenty &s;even degrees from the Pole; by the&s;e Seamen &s;teer their Cour&s;e, and &s;ometimes take their Latitude. Seeing our Cour&s;e &s;tood &s;till on that way, and that we daily di&s;covered new Stars, we had time enough to con&s;ider them, and to compare that new Region of the Firma|ment with the A&s;tronomical Map of <HI>Father Par|dies;</HI> but we found little or no conformity betwixt them. That Map needs much to be reformed, and one might begin with the <HI>Cro&s;iers,</HI> the Arms
<PB N="24" REF="16"> whereof are more unequal in the Firmament than in the Map. The <HI>Wolf</HI> and <HI>Centaur</HI> are &s;o care|le&s;ly and unfaithfully &s;et down in it, that with much ado can one know them in the Heavens, tho, in the mean time, they render the place they po&s;&s;e&s;s very bright and &s;parkling, by rea&s;on of the great number of Stars that compo&s;e them, and which &s;eem to make but one Con&s;tellation. But in the Map it is nothing le&s;s, where the two Con&s;tellations, can, at mo&s;t, pa&s;s but for ordina|ry. The &s;tars of the <HI>Southern Triangle,</HI> &s;eem in|deed to &s;tand in the Firmament in that very &s;ci|tuation which the Map gives them as to one ano|ther; but they &s;eem to be ill placed in relation to other Con&s;tellations. The &s;tars of the <HI>Bull</HI> are nothing near &s;o fair, as they appear to be in the Map, though the di&s;po&s;ition of them be much the &s;ame, the <HI>Crane,</HI> in my Opinion, is the Con|&s;tellation the be&s;t repre&s;ented of any on that &s;ide, and to &s;ee it once upon the Map, is enough to make one immediately find it out in the Hea|vens: The <HI>Bee,</HI> the <HI>Apodus</HI> or Bird of Paradi&s;e, and the <HI>Chamelion,</HI> tho they be &s;mall, yet are pretty well &s;et down. Something al&s;o would be reformed in the Figure and Scituation of the <HI>Clouds</HI> and other Meridional Con&s;tellations, wherein many more defects might be found out by means of in|&s;truments. If we had the plea&s;ure, as you may &s;ee, to ob&s;erve the gro&s;&s;er faults, we had the trouble at the &s;ame time, that we could not tell how to remedy them; the to&s;&s;ing of the Ship not &s;uffering us to make u&s;e of our In&s;truments, for re|forming that Map, &s;o as to make it a new one; which otherwi&s;e would not have been hard to be done. However we made a new one only by the eye,
<PB N="25" REF="16"> which, though it be not &s;o defective as the for|mer, yet cannot be &s;o exact as &s;uch works re|quire to be, wherein one cannot well &s;ucceed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of In&s;truments.</P>
<P>This was our u&s;ual Employment for the fir&s;t hours of the night and an hour or two before day, when the Sky was clear. However that was not all our diver&s;ion; for in the day time we had the plea&s;ure of Fi&s;hing.

Many liked the ta&s;te of it pretty well, and others could hardly en|dure the &s;mell thereof.

<P>We met not with &s;o many <HI>Bonitoes</HI> as Sailers commonly do, becau&s;e, perhaps, the number of Flying-fi&s;h was not then &s;o great in tho&s;e Seas.

<P>One of the&s;e Fi&s;h being hotly pur&s;ued one day leaped into our Ship and &s;truck again&s;t one of our Mates heads.

<P>The&s;e are the &s;orts of fi&s;h that we &s;aw mo&s;t about the Line. We had had the Sun apeek, that is to &s;ay, ju&s;t over head the nine and twenti|eth

<P>The weather being very clear that day; we had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that at noon the Ma&s;ts and every thing el&s;e in the Ship made no &s;hadow, After that we were becalmed for &s;even or eight days; and we made the remaining three&s;core and ten Leagues to the Line, only by &s;hort gu&s;ts of wind, which Clouds and Tempe&s;ts brought with them.

<P>Seeing we were not very much incommoded by the heats and calms in tho&s;e climates, we had but very few &s;ick Men on board, and in all our pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Good-hope,</HI> we lo&s;t but one Man; nay, and he too came on Board, tho' no body knew of it, with a Bloody-flux upon him, whereof he died.</P>
<P>It was certainly our duty to give God great thanks for the good weather he was plea&s;ed to &s;end us about the Line:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods parti|cular Prote|ction of all that were in the &s;hip.</NOTE> for had we been &s;topped by the calms &s;o long as many times Ships are weather-bound there, all our wa|ter, Bread, and Victuals would &s;oon have been &s;poiled, and have occa&s;ioned many Di&s;tempers, that mu&s;t needs have carried off many of our Men: as it happened this year to a Dutch Ship.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Phe|nomena's ob|&s;erved during the Voyage.</NOTE>Since we are &s;peaking of <HI>Phenomena</HI>'s or Appa|ritions, I mu&s;t not here forget a pretty rare one which we ob&s;erved betwixt the Line and Tropick of <HI>Capricorn;</HI> and which &s;eems to be diffi|cult to be explained. It was one of tho&s;e great whirl-winds which the Seamen call <HI>Spouts</HI> or wa|ter-<HI>dragons.</HI> They are like to long Tubes or Cylin|ders made of thick Vapours which with one end touch the Clouds, and with the other the Sea that &s;eems to boil all round it.

So when that long &s;pout of water comes to be cut by the Yards or Ma&s;ts of the Ship entring into it, when one cannot avoid the &s;ame; or the motion of the wind comes to be interrupted by rarifying the neighbouring air with Canon or Mu&s;quet-&s;hot: the water being then no longer &s;upported, falls in prodigious quantity, and im|mediately

There we began to &s;ee Fowl of various &s;hapes and weeds with great greeni&s;h Ru&s;hes ten or twelve foot long which they call Trunks, becau&s;e their &s;talk which grows and tapers in&s;en&s;ibly to the top where it ends in leaves of the &s;ame colour, repre&s;ents pretty well the &s;hape of an Elephants Trunk. The Sea-weeds are a kind of herb inclining to green, not unlike to Hay, whereof the &s;prigs are very long and interwoven one within another. Some think that the&s;e weeds come from the bottom of the Sea, being by the Waves forced from thence, and rai&s;ed to the &s;urface of the water. Others will have them to grow in the water, becau&s;e they &s;ee them far out at Sea, and they cannot believe that the Sea can be &s;o agitated as to carry its waves to the bottom and &s;o beat off the weeds from thence. Be&s;ides that they are found in &s;o great plenty upon the &s;urface of the Sea, that it looks like a great Meadow. La&s;tly, others main|tain, and that is the Opinion which &s;eems to me mo&s;t plau&s;ible and con&s;onant to truth, that the&s;e weeds come from the neighbouring Coa&s;ts, from whence the waves force them &s;o that they are car|ried put into the open Sea, but not very far from Land, either by the Tydes, Currents, or the pre|vailing winds.

<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO SIAM. The Second BOOK.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Voyage from the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> to the I&s;le of <HI>Java.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI> as tho&s;e that come from <HI>Europe</HI> make it, is a long Ridge of Mountains reaching from North to South, and ending in a Point in the Sea. The fir&s;t two which we made at, ten Leagues di&s;tance from that Point, are the Mountains of the <HI>Table,</HI> and of the <HI>Lyon.</HI> We made the <HI>Table</HI> Land fir&s;t, and it is called by that Name becau&s;e the Top of it is very flat, and much re&s;embles a Table. The <HI>Lyon-Land</HI> or Mountain is &s;o called, becau&s;e it hath a great deal
<PB N="44" REF="26"> of the Shape of a Lyon, couchant upon the Bel|ly: Though it run farther out into the Sea than the other, yet we did not &s;ee it till after; at a di&s;tance it would &s;eem that they were but one &s;ingle Mountain, and, indeed, they are not very remote. At the Foot of the&s;e Mountains a great Bay of an Oval Figure runs up towards the Ea&s;t, two or three Leagues within Land; it is almo&s;t two Leagues over at the Mouth, and about nine in compa&s;s. On the South &s;ide towards the Mountains it is all a &s;afe Coa&s;t, every where el&s;e it is dangerous near Shoar. The Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Ea&s;t India Company, of whom we have much to &s;ay in the Sequel, told us one day, that he was many times afraid, &s;eeing us &s;tand in &s;o near to Shoar, upon the Tacks we made, in&s;omuch that he was thinking to fire a Gun with a Bullet, to give us warning by that Signal, that we &s;hould keep off, and wait for a fairer Wind.</P>
<P>Towards the Middle of this Bay, the Dutch have built a Pentagone Fort below the <HI>Table-land,</HI> which covers it to the South, and behind the <HI>Ly|on-Mountain,</HI> that &s;ecures it to the We&s;t, a League from Land or thereabouts. In entering the Bay, you leave a pretty low I&s;land on the Left-hand, called I&s;le <HI>Robin,</HI> in the middle whereof the Hol|landers have put up their Flag. Thither they &s;end tho&s;e of the Country, and the Indians al&s;o whom they would puni&s;h with Bani&s;hment, and force them to make Lime there of the Shells that are ca&s;t up by the Sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danger of be|ing forced up|on a Rock as the Ship was coming to An|chor.</NOTE></P>

Immediately two Boats were lanched to tow us off, and get us clear of that Rock: But notwith&s;tanding the Fore-&s;ight of the Officers, and Diligence of the Crew in obeying their Or|ders, we were in great danger of running foul of it, the Current or Tide carrying us violently up|on the &s;ame, and we were not half a League from that Break, when &s;uddenly we had a Land-Breeze which obliged us to tow in our Boats a|gain, and &s;oon put us out of danger; we lo&s;t, however, two Top-&s;ails there, which were &s;plit by the Violence of the Wind. Being obliged all day long to beat too and again in the Mouth of the Bay, with a great deal of trouble, we could not get to the Place of Anchoring before the beginning of Night. Nay, we were obliged next Morning to weigh again, that we might lye under the Mountains &s;ecure from the We&s;t Winds, which are extreamly violent, and reign there in the Winter Time, as then it was. We came to an Anchor, then, next day about an hundred and fifty Yards from the Fort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ship came to an Anchor a|mid&s;t four Hollands Ve&s;|&s;els.</NOTE> There were in the Road of the Cape four great Ships, arrived there about a Month before from <HI>Holland,</HI> though they had been at Sea at lea&s;t two Months before us. The fir&s;t carried an Admirals Flag, as a Mark of the Supream Power and Command that the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company take to them&s;elves in the <HI>Indies.</HI> She was commanded by the <HI>Heer Van Rheeden,</HI> who was &s;ent by the Ea&s;t-India Company with the Title of Commi&s;&s;ary
<PB N="46" REF="28"> General, to vi&s;it all the Places which they hold in that Country. He had fullPower to order all things, to change the Officers of Factories, nay, and the Governours of Places al&s;o, if he thought fit. The &s;econd was commanded by the <HI>Heer St. Martin,</HI> a French Man by Country, and Ma|jor General of <HI>Battavia,</HI> in that Quality com|manding all the Forces the States have in the In|dies. One <HI>Bocheros</HI> an old Sea Captain, and Coun&s;ellor to the <HI>Heer Van Rheeden,</HI> during the Time of his Commi&s;&s;ion, commanded the third, the fourth attended the <HI>Heer St. Martin,</HI> who was to make all ha&s;te to <HI>Battavia.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e Gentlemen and M. <HI>Vander&s;tellen</HI> Go|vernour, or to u&s;e the Dutch Word, Comman|der of the Cape, are Men of Worth, and it was a happy Rencounter for us, that we had &s;uch Men to treat with, during the &s;tay that we made there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch &s;end to know from whence our Ships.</NOTE>No &s;ooner were we come to an Anchor, but two Boats came on Board of us, to know who we were, and next Morning about &s;even a Clock the Commi&s;&s;ary General &s;ent and complimented my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, who on his Part ordered the <HI>Chevaler de Forbin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Amba&s;&s;a|dor &s;ent to complement the Governor of the Cape.</NOTE> Lieutenant of the Ship, and three other Officers to go a&s;hoar and &s;alute him, and withal, to de&s;ire leave of him that we might take in fre&s;h Water and nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. He very civilly gave his Con&s;ent, and being inform|ed that there were &s;everal Gentlemen in the Am|ba&s;&s;adors Retinue, he invited them to come and hunt a&s;hoar. He inquired if there were any Je|&s;uits on board our Ship, and it is probable that they who came the day before had taken notice of us, and talked of it upon their Return. <HI>Mon|&s;ieur
<PB N="47" REF="28"> de Forbin</HI> made an&s;wer, that there were &s;ix of us going to <HI>China,</HI> and that there were other Church-men on board al&s;o bound for <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>Then they came to &s;peak of the Salutes, and it was agreed upon that the Fort &s;hould render Gun for Gun when our Ship &s;aluted it. This Article was ill explained, or ill under&s;tood by the&s;e Gen|tlemen, for about ten of the Clock my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador having ordered &s;even Guns to be fired, the Admiral an&s;wered only with five Guns, and the Fort fired none at all. Immediately the Am|ba&s;&s;ador &s;ent a&s;hoar again, and it was determined that the Admirals Salute &s;hould pa&s;s for nothing, and &s;o the Fort fired &s;even Guns, the Admiral &s;even Guns, and the other Ships five, to &s;alute the Kings Ship, which returned them their Salu|tation, for which the Fort and Ships gave their Thanks. After that we made ready our Boats, and thought of nothing now but of going a&s;hoar to refre&s;h our &s;elves.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we arrived in the Bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Je&s;uits vi&s;it the Go|vernor of the Cape.</NOTE> we found it to be &s;o proper a Place for making Ob&s;ervations, that we in&s;tantly re&s;olved to u&s;e all means that we might ob&s;erve: For that end there was a nece&s;&s;ity of taking a commodious Hou&s;e, carrying thither our In&s;truments, and haveing lei&s;ure to ply it both Day and Night during the &s;hort time we had to &s;tay there. There was difficulty in this; Je&s;uits, Mathematicians, and &s;everal In&s;truments carried a&s;hoar might oftend the Nicety of a Dutch Com|mander, in a pretty new Colony, and make him &s;u&s;pect &s;omething el&s;e than what we pretended. Nay, we were advi&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e our &s;elves, and not to appear to be Je&s;uits; but we did not think it fit, and we found by what followed, that our Ha|bit did us no Injury at all.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="29">
<P>After we had a little con&s;idered on't, it was re&s;olved, that Father <HI>Fontenay</HI> and I, &s;hould go vi&s;it the Commi&s;&s;ary General and the Governor of the Place before the re&s;t went a&s;hoar, and that if in Di&s;cour&s;e we found occa&s;ion to open our De&s;ign, we &s;hould lay hold on it. We went &s;trait to the Fort then without any other Recommendation: The Sentinel &s;topt us at the fir&s;t Gate, according to the Cu&s;tom of Gari&s;on-places, until an Officer of the Guard being come, and having informed him&s;elf that we were come to pay a Vi&s;it to the Commi&s;&s;ary General and Governor, he com|manded us to be let in, and gave us a Soldier to conduct us to their Apartment.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of a large Pile of Building two Storys high, and very &s;olidly built. It is covered with a very fair Tarra&s;s, paved with broad free Stone, with Balconies and Iron Rails all round; thither they commonly go to take the fre&s;h Air.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Climate of the Cape of <HI>Good-hope</HI> is very tempe|rate.</NOTE> This Country has &s;o temperate an Air, that it is never very cold there, but when a South Wind blows; and though it was the depth of Winter then in relation to that Climate, yet it was &s;o hot in the day time, that they were glad to go take the fre&s;h Air in the Evening.</P>
<P>We went fir&s;t into a great Hall where they preach every Sunday until the Church be fini&s;h|ed that was begun to be built without the Fort. On both &s;ides of that Hall there are pretty hand|&s;ome Apartments; they had us in to that which was on the Left-hand, where we were received by <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vander&s;tel,</HI> and whither pre&s;ently after the <HI>Heer Van Rheeden</HI> came to &s;ee us. He is a Man of Quality about fifty years of age, Hand|&s;ome, Civil, Wi&s;e, and Learned, and who
<PB N="49" REF="29"> thinks and &s;peaks well on all Subjects; we were extreamly &s;urpri&s;ed to meet with &s;o much Polite|ne&s;s at the <HI>Cape of Good-hope,</HI> and much more at the Civilities and many Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip which we received at that fir&s;t Interview. Fa|ther <HI>Fontenay,</HI> who&s;e Interpreter I was at that time in <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> finding &s;o lucky Di&s;po&s;itions for our De&s;ign, told the Commi&s;&s;ary General that there were &s;ix Je&s;uits of us who were bound for the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> that not being at all ac|cu&s;tomed to the Fatigues of Sea, we &s;tood in need of taking a little Air on Land, that we might be recruited after &s;o long a Voyage; that we dur&s;t not do &s;o, before we knew their Minds, whether they would be contented with it or not. The Commi&s;&s;ary General did not &s;uffer me to inter|pret all that Father <HI>Fontenay</HI> had &s;aid to him, but pre&s;ently interrupting me: You'l do us the great|e&s;t plea&s;ure imaginable, Fathers, &s;aid he, in <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> to come and refre&s;h your &s;elves at Land, we will contribute all that lies in our Power to your Refre&s;hment and Recovery.</P>
<P>This An&s;wer was &s;o favourable that we went a little farther; we told him, that being a&s;hoar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Je&s;uits are extreamly well received by the Dutch.</NOTE> we &s;hould be glad to employ our &s;elves for the publick Good, and then to communicate to him our Ob&s;ervations; thereby to acknowledge in &s;ome manner the Civilities that he had &s;hown us: that we had brought with us from <HI>France</HI> &s;everal Ma|thematical In&s;truments, among&s;t which there were &s;ome very proper for finding out the true Longitude of Countries through which one pa&s;&s;|ed, without any need of the Eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon; we explained to him the new way of ob&s;erving by the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> of which
<PB N="50" REF="30"> the Learned <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> hath made &s;o good Tables. I added that thereby we would render a very con&s;iderable Service to their Pilots, by giving them the certain Longitude of the Cape of <HI>Good-hope,</HI> which they only gue&s;&s;ed at by their reckoning, a very doubtful way that many times deceive them, and that very con&s;iderably too. He told us that we would thereby oblige him, and that &s;eeing we had a mind to labour in that Di&s;covery, he offered us a Place every way pro|per for ob&s;erving. At the &s;ame time he ordered a Summer-hou&s;e that is in the Companies Gar|den to be made ready for us to lodge in, &s;o long as the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould continue in the Road.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Civilities of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Van Rheeden.</HI></NOTE>We made an&s;wer that the Civility which he &s;hew'd us &s;hould not re&s;t there, and that we hop|ed my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador would have the Good|ne&s;s to thank him, and take it as a Kindne&s;s done partly to him&s;elf. Then we &s;hew'd him our Pa|tents for being the Kings Mathematicians. You encrea&s;e my Joy, Fathers replied the Commi&s;&s;a|ry, in letting me &s;ee that I comply with the Will and Orders of &s;o great a King, for whom I &s;hall entertain a profound Re&s;pect &s;o long as I live. However I am not vexed that you did not &s;peak to me of that before I obliged you to accept of a Lodging, which I offer you freely, and with all my heart.

<P><HI>Monday</HI> after Dinner we went to the Fort, to &s;ee the Gentlemen, and communicate to them the Ob&s;ervations which we had already made, and acquaint them with that we were to make that E|vening, according to which alone one might re|gulate the true Longitude of the Cape. Upon our return all the&s;e Gentlemen would needs go along with us, to be Spectators of that Ob&s;ervati|on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Interview betwixt the Amba&s;&s;ador and Commi&s;|&s;ary General.</NOTE> We were together upon the Terra&s;s taken up in &s;howing them our In&s;truments, which &s;eemed very pretty and curious to them; when we perceived my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, who having come <HI>incognito</HI> the Day before to walk in the Gar|den, found it &s;o plea&s;ant, that he returned again next day to divert him&s;elf there, with mo&s;t part of the Officers of both Ships, and the Gentlemen of his Retinue. The Amba&s;&s;ador and Commi&s;&s;a|ry had mutually enterchanged many Civilities from the very day of our Arrival, and no day pa&s;t without &s;ending one another Pre&s;ents. The <HI>Heer Van Rheeden</HI> perceiving him, went immedi|ately down from the Terra&s;s, where he was ob|&s;erving with us, and after two or three turns, meeting the Amba&s;&s;ador as by chance, they en|tertained one another to their mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>

The emer&s;ion of the fir&s;t <HI>Satelles</HI> happened at ten Hours, five Min. forty Sec. of the Clock not rectified.

<P>After the emer&s;ion of the fir&s;t <HI>Satelles</HI> from under the Shadow of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> having compared together the heights of the Sun, taken Morning and Evening, the third and fourth of <HI>June,</HI> and con&s;ider|ed the difference of time among&s;t the &s;ame heights of the &s;uperior and inferior Limb or Border of the Sun, becau&s;e in the Morning we had ob&s;erv|ed the &s;uperior Border, and in the Evening the inferior, we found that the Pendulum went fa&s;ter than the Sun both days, by eight and twenty Minutes.</P>

<P>The <HI>Ephemerides</HI> of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> Calculated to Minutes gave the time of that Emer&s;ion in the Meridian of <HI>Paris</HI> to be at eight Hours, twenty &s;ix Minutes.</P>
<P>But his Tables of Ecclip&s;es Calculated to Se|conds, gave the &s;ame emer&s;ion at eight a Clock, twenty five Min. forty Seconds.</P>

<P>Towards the Evening we had notice &s;ent us a

The Amba&s;&s;ador had prayed the <HI>Heer van Rheeden</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary Ge|neral to write to the General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> that he would give us a Pilot to conductus to <HI>Siam,</HI> and
<PB N="61" REF="36"> he having undertaken the Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ent the Amba&s;&s;ador, next day, a very obliging Letter for that General, wherein towards the end he added of him&s;elf, without any Sollicitation from us, an Article in our Favours. We &s;pent the Night in packing up our In&s;truments again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We reimbark|ed in order to Sail.</NOTE> and next Mor|ning before day we put them into a Chaloop, which the Commander ordered to be in readi|ne&s;s for us, and &s;o we went on broad again.</P>
<P>This is all that pa&s;t at the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> in relation to our ob&s;ervations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What care was taken of the Catholicks at the Cape.</NOTE> Though we plied them day and night, yet they were not our only Employment. No &s;ooner had we got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our little Ob&s;ervatory, but the Catholicks of that Colony, who are pretty numerous, had no|tice of it, and were thereat exceedingly rejoyced. In the Mornings and Evenings they came privately to us. There were &s;ome of all Countries, and of all Conditions, Free, Slaves, <HI>French, Germans, Portugue&s;e, Spaniards, Flemings,</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Senti|ments of the Catholicks on the Cape upon our arrival.</NOTE> They who could no otherwi&s;e expre&s;s them&s;elves; be|cau&s;e we under&s;tood not their Language, fell up|on their Knees and ki&s;&s;ed our hands. They pulled Chaplets and Medals out of their Bo&s;oms to &s;how that they were Catholicks, they wept and &s;mote their Brea&s;ts. That Language of the Heart much more touching than words, wrought great Com|pa&s;&s;ion in us, and obliged us to embrace tho&s;e poor People, whom Chri&s;tian Charity made us look upon as our Brethren. We comforted them the be&s;t we could, exhorting them to per&s;evere in the Faith of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> humbly and faithfully to &s;erve their Ma&s;ters, and to bear their troubles with Patience. We commended it to them par|ticularly that they would examine their Con&s;ciences
<PB N="62" REF="37"> at night, and honour the holy Virgin, who was able&s;t to procure them more Grace to live Chri|&s;tianly, and to keep them from Here&s;ie. They who &s;poke <HI>French, Latin, Spani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> were confe&s;&s;ed. We vi&s;ited the Sick in their Hou&s;es and in the Ho&s;pital. This was all that could be done for their Con&s;olation in &s;o &s;hort a time, they not having the Liberty to come on board of us and hear Ma&s;s, nor we to &s;ay it to them a Shoar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Je&s;uits are &s;u&s;pected of admini|&s;ting the Sa|craments.</NOTE> Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t have been &s;u&s;pected at the Cape that we carried them the Sacrament. For two of our Fathers returning one day from on Board with a Micro&s;cope in one of their Hands covered with Spani&s;h Leather gilt, two or three of the Inhabitants walking upon the Shoar, imagined it to be the holy Sacrament which they were carrying to Catholicks in a Box. They drew near to the Father to know the truth of the matter; the Father told them what it was, and to convince them, made them look into the Micro&s;cope. Then one of them told him, Sir, I thought it had been &s;o, becau&s;e I know that you are the greate&s;t Enemies of our Religion. We could not but &s;mile at that &s;aying, but with|out making an&s;wer we kept on in our way &s;trait to the Fort.</P>
<P>To conclude all that concerns the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> it only remains that I relate what we learned of the &s;tate of the Countrey. For &s;ome of our Fathers were charged to inform them|&s;elves of that, whil&s;t the re&s;t were taken up a|bout their Ob&s;ervations. In that Pro&s;pect we made it our Bu&s;ine&s;s to get out of <HI>M. Vander&s;tellen</HI> in the &s;everal Conver&s;ations we had with him all that could contribute to our Information; and we
<PB N="63" REF="37"> made acquaintance with a young Phy&s;ician of <HI>Bra|&s;lon</HI> in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> called Mr. <HI>Claudius,</HI> whom the Dutch for his great Capacity entertain at the Cape. Seeing he hath already travelled into <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> where it was his Cu&s;tom to ob&s;erve every thing, and that he de&s;igns and paints Animals and plants perfectly well, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have &s;top'd him there to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in making their new di&s;|coveries of Countries, and labour about the natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Africa.</HI> He hath compleated two great Volumes in Folio of &s;everal Plants, which are drawn to the life, and he hath made a Collection of all the kinds which he hath pa&s;ted to the Leaves of another Volume. Without doubt the <HI>Heer van Rheeden</HI> who had always the&s;e Books by him at home, and who &s;hewed them to us, has a de&s;ign to give the publick &s;hortly an <HI>Hor|tus Africus</HI> after his <HI>Hortus Malabaricus.</HI> Had the&s;e Books been to be &s;old, we would have &s;pared no Co&s;t to have bought them and &s;ent them to the Kings Library.

<PB N="66" REF="40"> There are not &s;o many Lyons nor Tygers as Stags, but yet there is a great many of them, and I can ea&s;ily believe it becau&s;e of the va&s;t number of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts skins wherein they Trade at the Cape.

Their Women naturally are very fair, but to plea&s;e their Hus|bands they make them&s;elves black as they do.</P>
<P>Married Women have the upper part of their head &s;haved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Appa|rel.</NOTE> and upon their ears long &s;harp point|ed &s;hells. They cover them&s;elves with the skins of Tygers, coloured Rats, which they tye about their bodies with thongs. That Nation highly value a certain kind of pith of &s;tone, which is not to be found but in the heart of &s;ome Rock, and is pretty hard and of a very dark colour. Ex|perience
<PB N="78" REF="49"> hath taught them that that Mineral is of a wonderful Virtue to bring Women to Bed when they are in Labour, and to make their Cows, Sheep, and Goats ea&s;ily bring forth. When the Dutch blew up a great Rock with a Mine they &s;prung, they were vexed and complained of it as if they had been Robbed of a great Trea|&s;ure. Upon my return I had a piece of that Mineral given me, with &s;ome of the other &s;orts that have been found in that Country.</P>
<P>There are many other &s;orts of Animals and In|&s;ects to be found there, whereof the&s;e are the Figures. The fir&s;t is a Serpent with horns, called the <HI>Cera&s;tes</HI> which has not been hitherto &s;een, and who&s;e poi&s;on is extremely dangerous. Se|condly, a Camelion that changes it &s;elf into all colours. And has a cry like to a Rat. Thirdly, a Lizard, when one &s;trikes him he makes a Moan like a Child that cries, and growing angry bri&s;tles up his &s;cales wherewith he is rough all over. His Tongue is blewi&s;h and very long, and when any body comes near him, he is heard to blow with great violence. There is another Lizzard al&s;o to be found there, that is marked with three white cro&s;&s;es, but the bite of it is not &s;o dangerous as that of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>From all that hath been &s;aid, it plainly appears, that that Part of <HI>Africa</HI> is no le&s;s Peopled, le&s;s Rich, nor le&s;s Fertile in all &s;orts of Fruits and Animals, than the other Parts already di&s;covered, though it hath been &s;o long neglected.

In this Doubt we took the &s;ure&s;t Cour&s;e, and &s;teered away Ea&s;t, for fear of falling to the Leeward of the Streight of the Sound, into which it would have been difficult to enter, by rea&s;on of the South and South-Ea&s;t Wind that reigns there con&s;tantly in that Sea&s;on.

<P>Therefore it was that we came in with the Land above three&s;core Leagues farther up than the mo&s;t We&s;tern point of that I&s;le which we

The &s;ight of the&s;e Lands &s;eemed &s;omewhat rare to us; they are covered with Trees of a mo&s;t love|ly verdure, which yield a plea&s;ant &s;mell to the Ships that Sail along the Coa&s;t, at two or three Leagues di&s;tance. We Coa&s;ted along that I&s;le with &s;o good a wind, that in a day and a halfs time we made the &s;ixty Leagues which we had run too far to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and Monday evening the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> were got to the entry into the <HI>Streight</HI> of the <HI>Sound</HI> which is made by the I&s;les of <HI>Java</HI> and <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>But what &s;urpri&s;ed us more, and was a &s;ign of Gods particular Providence upon our Voyage, the &s;ame evening that we &s;aw the entry into the Streight of the Sound, we made the <HI>Maligne,</HI> which was &s;eparated from us by the bad weather I mentioned, <HI>June</HI> 24. in the night time, and which we had never &s;een &s;ince. Though my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador and &s;everal others took it to be the Frigat, yet we could not be &s;ure of that, be|cau&s;e it was already late, and the weather dark. We were not certain it was &s;he till eight days af|ter in the Road of <HI>Bantam</HI> where we joyned her again. The Pilots who were aboard of her hav|ing made the Streight in good time, put into it, and having a fair wind came to the place of An|choring. But it being u&s;ual to &s;hoot the Streight of the Sound betwixt the Princes I&s;le and <HI>Suma|tra,</HI> keeping as near as may be to the Princes I&s;le,
<PB N="93" REF="57"> which we could not make plainly becau&s;e of the night, we were forced to tack and &s;tand off to Sea all the night long. So that &s;ince we could not make the be&s;t of the fair weather which then we had, which would have ea&s;ily carried us beyond the Princes I&s;le, we fell too low, and &s;pent the re&s;t of the week in the Streight, which is not above thirty Leagues in length, &s;trugling and beating again&s;t the Currents and contrary winds. One of our Pilots a&s;&s;ured us that the <HI>Sun</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of which he was aboard in an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Voyage, was three full weeks &s;topped there, and could not get to <HI>Bantam</HI> but as &s;he was towed with Boats.</P>
<P>We entred then the Streight of the Sound three days after we made the Land of <HI>Java,</HI> but the Princes I&s;land lying at the mouth of the &s;treight betwixt <HI>Java</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and dividing it into two, we entred by the more Northern Pa&s;&s;age, which is the larger and &s;afer betwixt the Princes I&s;le and <HI>Sumatra.</HI> We made many Tacks to dou|ble the I&s;le of <HI>Cacatoua</HI> (&s;o called becau&s;e of the white Parrots that are upon that I&s;le, which in|ce&s;&s;antly repeat that name) we did, I &s;ay, all that lay in our power to double the I&s;le or <HI>Cacato&uuml;a,</HI> which lyes pretty near to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> that &s;o we might &s;tand in with the Land of <HI>Java:</HI> but all our attempts were un&s;ucce&s;sful becau&s;e the wind was too weak, and Currents too &s;trong in the middle of the Channel. That which cau&s;es the Currents, is becau&s;e the water that for &s;everal Months has been forced into the Streights by the South and South|we&s;t-winds, which reign commonly from the Month of <HI>March</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> &s;et our again impetuou&s;ly during the other &s;ix Months of the year, being bent back by the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>North Ea&s;t</HI> winds.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="58">
<P>We had the wind &s;o cro&s;s, and the Currents &s;o contrary, that it was thought be&s;t to keep as clo&s;e in as we could by the Shore of the Princes I&s;le,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breezes ri&s;e on <HI>Sumatra</HI> at certain hours of the day.</NOTE> by the help of &s;ome Breezes that came from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and which for &s;ome hours interrupted the great heats and dead calms that are common in that &s;ea&s;on in the Streights of the Sound.</P>
<P>By the help of tho&s;e little Breezes we were in hopes by little and little to come up with the Land of <HI>Java,</HI> but it behoved us fir&s;t to double the Princes I&s;le which is pretty big, and lies in the mouth of the Streight. After all, the view which we had of the Land and of &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands all decked in verdure comforted us a little, for the time which we lo&s;t in that Streight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The danger the Ship was in, in the Streight.</NOTE>Nay we were like to have been &s;tranded one night upon the Princes I&s;le, as we endeavoured to bear clo&s;e in with it.

Hardly were we got out of the &s;trength of the Currents, when the Officer that was upon the Watch, and the Sea|men who were upon the Deck, took notice that the Ship ran apace towards Land. They had only time to tack about and &s;tand off, which was done &s;o much in the nick, that when the Ship was a|bout, and the Sails trimmed, one might ea&s;ily have thrown a &s;tone on Shore, from the Poup of our Ship.</P>

<P>If Ships could come to an Anchor in the Streight, they would not be expo&s;ed to that dan|ger; but no ground being to be found in it, at lea&s;t off of the Princes I&s;le, we were forced to keep continually under Sail, and when it was a Calm to keep at large among&s;t the Currents, which made us lo&s;e &s;ometimes in le&s;s than three hours what with &s;mall Breezes we had got in four before. Thus we &s;pent &s;everal days in pa&s;&s;ing that I&s;land, where we had leizure enough to make tryal of the extraordinary heats of that Climate, and to con|&s;ider <HI>Sumatra</HI> which appeared to us always covered with a black thick mi&s;t, and in the evening with continual fla&s;hes of Lightning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraordina|ry Thunder and Lightning at <HI>Java</HI> and <HI>Sumatra.</HI></NOTE> Thunder is very common there; and among&s;t others we had one Clap &s;o hard and &s;mart, that many took it for a Canon-&s;hot, and &s;ome dabb'd down their heads, as if it had been to avoid the Bullet. At length a good Breeze did our work for us, made us double the I&s;le and carried us upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Java.</HI> When we were got in with that Land, we advanced by little and little, dropping an Anchor &s;o &s;oon as the wind left us.

The&s;e Hor&s;es &s;eem to be hard in the mouth, hang upon the Bitt, and always to&s;s up their heads; but I believe the&s;e faults proceed from their Bridles and the neglect of breaking them well.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;ter being over, we went up a pair of Stone Stairs on the out&s;ide of a great Hall, where we found Guards and the Generals Pages, all cloathed after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, with this diffe|rence only, that the la&s;t wear no Swords. The Trea|&s;urer de&s;ired us to &s;tay in that Hall, until he went and &s;poke to the General. A moment after he came back and led us through a Gallery into another Hall, which was nothing near &s;o big as

We could not have expected greater Civilities nor Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip than we received from him at this fir&s;t Audience. The joy that appeared in his looks, his care&s;&s;es and obliging di&s;cour&s;es &s;ufficiently convinced us of the &s;incerity of his heart and actions. He ordered our Letters Patents for being the Kings Mathe|maticians, to be read to him, and prayed us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o give him an account of the Ob&s;ervations we made at the Cape of <HI>Good H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pe,</HI> &s;till prai&s;ing us, before the Gentlemen that attended him.</P>
<P>When he under&s;tood that the <HI>Heer Van Rheed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> had lodged us at the Cape, and how he had recei|ved and treated us, He prote&s;ted he would not be &s;hort of him, and that if we had a de&s;ign to come on Shoar, he entreated us to lodge with Father <HI>Fu|citi,</HI> to whom from that day forward he gave all &s;ort of liberty for our &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

<P>We made the be&s;t an&s;wer we could to all his goodne&s;s, a&s;&s;uring him that the King &s;hould be informed of it, and that my Lord Amba&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r would re&s;ent it. At length, after a three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> conference, which was only interrupted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">, Sweet-meats and Healths to the King, the Royal Family, the Amba&s;&s;ador, and our own, which he drank to us, he &s;uffered us with much ado to
<PB N="116" REF="73"> withdraw. He waited on us to the end of a long Gallery which leads into the fir&s;t Hall, and ordered the Governor of a Province and the Trea&s;urer, not to leave us before we were &s;afely returned to General <HI>Spelmans</HI> Garden, where we were to lodge. As we went out of the Hall we found a Coach, with two Pages carrying Torches to conduct us to our Lodging. What re&s;i&s;tance &s;oever we could make, we were nece&s;&s;i|tated to obey, and it was a new &s;ight to &s;ee two Je&s;uits in the Generals Coach riding through the capital City of the Indies.</P>
<P>We &s;oon got to our Lodging, where Father <HI>Fuciti</HI> waited for us, and was not a little a&s;toni&s;h|ed to &s;ee us come home in that Equipage. No &s;ooner were we got there, but a plentiful Supper was brought us from the Generals Palace, who during all the time we were at <HI>Batavia</HI> al|lowed us a Magnificent Table for a dozen of Gue&s;ts, where we were &s;erved by his Officers in fine China and Plate, with all neatne&s;s, and dain|tine&s;s, and plenty imaginable.</P>
<P>Next day Father <HI>Fucity</HI> entreated the Father &s;uperiour to carry him on Board and pre&s;ent him to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, that he might pay his re&s;pects unto him, and thank him for his good|ne&s;s in concerning him&s;elf in his liberty. We were all three carried thither in the Generals Chaloop, which, as he &s;ent us word, he wholly left to us to be made u&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s often as we had oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The four Fathers who remained on Board were in pain for us; becau&s;e we could not &s;end them word how we were, and they were appre|hen&s;ive that &s;ome unwelcome accident might
<PB N="117" REF="73"> have befallen us at <HI>Batavia.</HI> But they were much &s;urpri&s;ed when they &s;aw us return in a &s;tately Chaloop, with the Dutch Flag aboard and all the marks of Grandeur that attend the General, except his Guards. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador to whom we gave an account of all that pa&s;t, received Father <HI>Fuciti</HI> very kindly, and offered him his Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Siam.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|court,</HI> &s;hewed him the like Civilities; &s;o that it was immediately re&s;olved upon that the Father &s;hould Embarque with us and compleat the re&s;t of the Voyage.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after it behoved us to go a&s;hoar again with &s;ome In&s;truments to Ob&s;erve with the night following. But the sky was &s;o overca&s;t both night and day all the while we were at <HI>Batavia,</HI> that we could make but very few Ob&s;ervations, and the&s;e too did not appear to us to be &s;ure enough to de&s;erve to be communicated to the pub|lick.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as we came a&s;hoar we went all &s;ix to vi&s;it the General with Father <HI>Fuciti.</HI> He received us with the &s;ame &s;igns of kindne&s;s and good will, as he had done the day before. It is true, he complained a little of the conduct of Father <HI>Fu|citi,</HI> who had been rendred &s;u&s;pected to him be|cau&s;e of his Zeal in a&s;&s;i&s;ting and in&s;tructing the Catholics, adding, that he was obliged to &s;ee the Laws of the Ea&s;t-India Company put in Exe|cution; that he believed we would not think his proceeding either ungentile or unju&s;t; that he prayed us to ob&s;erve mea&s;ures, and &s;o to carry our &s;elves in relation to Catholics that he might not be reproached for any te&s;timony of Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem that he had already expre&s;&s;ed towards
<PB N="118" REF="74"> us, and was ready &s;till to te&s;tifie upon all occa&s;i|ons. We made an&s;wer in Portugue&s;e that his Excellence &s;hould be &s;atisfied with our Conduct, and that he &s;hould never have cau&s;e to repent the Favours which hitherto he had heaped upon us, and was &s;till willing to honour us with for the future.</P>
<P>Then we fell to Di&s;cour&s;e on &s;everal matters, we talked of News, and particularly of the French King, who&s;e Glory and Greatne&s;s the General &s;eemed to admire. Before he let us go which was pretty late, he &s;hewed us &s;everal Curio&s;ities of <HI>Japan,</HI> among&s;t others two human Figures of a kind of Plai&s;ter, extremely well done, and clad in Silk after the manner of the <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> one of a Lord and the other of a Lady. He al&s;o &s;hewed us certain Trees who&s;e Roots were enclo|&s;ed within foraminous and very porous &s;tones where they are &s;o in&s;inuated that they receive all their nouri&s;hment from the water that is now and then thrown upon them.</P>
<P>Tho we were not &s;o much obliged as we are to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Campiche</HI> General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> yet we could not but &s;peak well of him: His Merit hath rai&s;ed him by degrees to the hige&s;t place of the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dies,</HI> which at pre&s;ent he &s;o worthily di&s;charges, after he hath been thrice Pre&s;ident of the Compa|ny of <HI>Japan.</HI> He is about fifty years of age, &s;omewhat taller then ordinary, an hone&s;t, &s;incere and circum&s;pect Man, &s;peaking little, but very Judiciou&s;ly and to purpo&s;e. The&s;e qualities ac|companied with a mild popular way of Carriage, have got him the love of his own Country, and the e&s;teem of Stangers, both <HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> We were told that he had &s;ome Pictures in his
<PB N="119" REF="74"> Clo&s;et, and among&s;t others, one of our Saviours praying in the Garden of Olives, with the&s;e words written with his own Hand, <HI>Anima mea Chri&s;tus e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The days following we went and vi&s;ited the chief Officers of the Ea&s;t-India Company; all of them &s;hew'd us great Civilities; nay, many of them returned our Vi&s;it at the Companies Garden. We were vi&s;ited al&s;o by the Catholics of all &s;orts and conditions, who de&s;ired to receive the Sa|craments; but that we might not di&s;plea&s;e the General, nor bring the Catholics into Trouble, we appointed &s;uch as were able to come on board of us, and confe&s;&s;ed the re&s;t &s;o privately, either in their Hou&s;es at Home, or in the Place where we were, that no notice was taken of it. Father <HI>Fucity</HI> e&s;pecially, took no Re&s;t all the while that we were with him. For having upon our com|ing, got Liberty to go about every where, he was taken up from Morning to Night in com|forting and confe&s;&s;ing here and there all that &s;tood in need of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is with the Catholic Religion in <HI>Batavia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catho|lic Religion is the only Religion pro|hibited at <HI>Ba|tavia.</HI></NOTE> and in the <HI>Indies</HI> Subject to the Dutch, as it is in <HI>Holland.</HI> All &s;orts, and even Idolatry it &s;elf, are tolerated, provided they pay a certain Tri|bute to the Magi&s;trates. None but the Catho|lic Religion is prohibited; not that they reckon it the wor&s;t of all, but becau&s;e they look upon it as the mo&s;t dangerous, and fear that many who do not prefer their Intere&s;t before their Salvation, would embrace it if they knew it.</P>
<P>We were confidently told that &s;ome Months before; the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who are very numerous, had offered a va&s;t Sum of Money to the Ea&s;t-India
<PB N="120" REF="75"> Company to have leave to build a Catholic Church, either in the Town or in the Suburbs, and that they would engage them&s;elves be&s;ides, to pay &s;ixteen thou&s;and Crowns a year. This Affair having been propo&s;ed to the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> was referred to the Chief of the Com|pany in <HI>Holland,</HI> but there is no hopes that they will grant this Favour to Catholics, for fear, it is &s;aid, they &s;hould become the Ma&s;ters in <HI>Bata|via.</HI> There are four Prote&s;tant Churches there, two where they preach every Sunday in Dutch, the one in the Fort, and the other in the Town. A third where they preach in <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> which is the mo&s;t common Language of the Country. And a fourth for the <HI>French,</HI> who are in pretty con&s;iderable number there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Bata|via.</HI></NOTE>As for <HI>Batavia,</HI> it is the plea&s;ante&s;t Town in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and would pa&s;s for a very hand&s;ome Place in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> have built it at their plea&s;ure, with a De&s;ign to make it the Capital City of their Empire. The Streets are long and broad, all in a &s;treight Line, betwixt two Walks of Trees of the Country that are always green; mo&s;t part of them are even divided into fair &s;mooth Ways, and lovely Canals warfed, which in all Sea&s;ons are filled by a great River, that at this Place di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea.</P>
<P>They have conveighed the Water of this Ri|ver into the Ditches of the Town and Fort, at &s;mall Charges, becau&s;e the Ground is level and ea&s;ie to be ca&s;t up. This Warf is a great Orna|ment to the Town, and a great Convenience for the Inhabitants, who may go abroad and take the Air a Foot, or by Water in Boat, which they
<PB REF="75">
<PB REF="76">
<PB N="121" REF="76"> plea&s;e. For during the Heat, they walk under the Shadow of the Trees; and the Streets are &s;o laid, having a De&s;cent towards the Canal, that the Rain-water runs off of them as fa&s;t as it falls. The Hou&s;es are neater &s;till than the Streets; the truth is, they are not very magnificent, neither in&s;ide nor out&s;ide, but they are pretty and com|modious. Every thing &s;miles there, the Walls are as white as Snow, there is not the lea&s;t Spot to be &s;een upon them, nor upon the Furniture, which is all poli&s;hed, and &s;hines like Looking-Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Batavia</HI> be but &s;ix Degrees from the Line, and by con&s;equence in a very hot Climate, yet the Hou&s;es are built in &s;uch a manner, that they have always the Cool, by rea&s;on of certain little Courts contrived in the middle, where for eight or nine Months in the Year the Sun never &s;hines but at Noon. It is fortified after the Eu|ropean manner, encompa&s;&s;ed with Ditches full of Water, and in a Ground that is all cut by Chan|nels, which makes it difficult to be&s;iege it. The Citadel hath four Ba&s;tions faced and mounted with a great number of bra&s;s Guns. There is a good Gari&s;on kept in it, not only to hold it out again&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Europeans,</HI> and to &s;uccour the other Places in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; but al&s;o to &s;hew the Greatne&s;s and Power of the Company to Am|ba&s;&s;adors and Princes, who come thither from all Places of the <HI>Indies. Batavia</HI> is of a very large Circumference, and neverthele&s;s extreamly full of People of all &s;orts of Nations, of <HI>Malays, Maures, Chine&s;es,</HI> who pay &s;o much Tribute a Head, for the free Exerci&s;e of Commerce; of the&s;e la&s;t there are four or five thou&s;and there, who for

They labour the Land, there is hardly any other Artificers but them, and in a word, they do every thing almo&s;t. Some of them are very rich, and we were told that one of them died lately, who left behind him a Million in coined Money.</P>
<P>Having learnt of a Catholic Soldier, that the&s;e People had their Temple and Sepulchres a|broad in the Country, about half a League from <HI>Batavia,</HI> we pray'd him to conduct us thither that we might &s;ee their Ceremonies. In that Walk we &s;ee the Avenues of the Town at lei&s;ure, they are very broad Walks or Allies, that reach out of &s;ight. On each &s;ide they are bordered with certain Woods always green, which are &s;treighter, and at lea&s;t as high as our talle&s;t Trees, beautified with Country Hou&s;es and Gardens kept in good order, which belong to the chief Town&s;-people. As we went out of <HI>Batavia</HI> we found three or four of the&s;e Walks, all which at their end, met at the chief Gate, by which we went out, we took the middlemo&s;t, which was our way to the place intended. If the other Gates that look into the Country have as lovely Ave|nues as this, nothing more plea&s;ant can be ima|gined.</P>
<P>Within half a League we found the fir&s;t bury|ing Place of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in a Coppis Wood, where they had made &s;everal &s;mall Paths, which all led to &s;everal Sepulchres. There it is where

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="78">
<PB REF="79">
<PB N="123" REF="79"> the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> of mean Quality are buried, and in|deed the Place is &s;omewhat in di&s;order, and there is nothing of State in their Tombs: A few &s;teps from thence &s;tands the little Fort of <HI>Jacatra;</HI> It has four Ba&s;tions, not at all faced, with a &s;orry Ditch. The <HI>Dutch</HI> keep fifty or &s;ixty Men in Gari&s;on there. Beyond that Fort we entered in|to a Wood, or rather into a large Champian full of little Hills, covered over with Groves and Thickets on all &s;ides, which yielded a pretty plea|&s;ant Pro&s;pect, and in that &s;econd Burying-place the <HI>Chine&s;e Bonzes</HI> interr the Per&s;ons of Quality of their Nation. Upon the top of one of tho&s;e lit|tle Hills I &s;aw an Arbour very well made, and a Table &s;tanding in the middle of it, with Benches all round it, where near forty People might com|modiou&s;ly &s;it. There I &s;aw a great many very little and odd antick Idols hanging upon the Bran|ches that covered this Arbour. They &s;ay that the <HI>Bonzes</HI> make Fea&s;ts for the Dead, and bring them thither for them to eat; mo&s;t part of the&s;e Tombs are &s;o many little <HI>Mau&s;oleums,</HI> very neat and pretty; here is the Figure of one of the lovelie&s;t of them, by which you may judge of the re&s;t, for they are all made after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion, with this difference only, that &s;ome have Dragons in &s;tead of Lyons upon the Gate, as you enter into them, and that they are more or few|er Steps high, according to their Magnificence.</P>
<P>Being come out of the Burying-Place, we heard the Noi&s;e of Cimbals and little Bells, and follow|ing the Sound, came to a little Temple of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> where their Prie&s;ts were a&s;&s;embled to offer a Sacrifice. That Temple is built much in the manner of our little Churches, both without
<PB N="124" REF="80"> and within At the entry there was a pretty big Porch open on all hands. There they enter|tain the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> that are pre&s;ent at the Sacrifices; there they Talk, Eat, Drink freely, and make no &s;cruple to invite Strangers to do &s;o. We would not accept of the <HI>Betle</HI> and <HI>Areka</HI> which they pre&s;ented us, for fear they might have been offered to Idols. The truth is, under the Porch on each &s;ide of the Temple-door, there was a kind of Altar with their Steps, loaded with Py|ramids of all &s;orts of &s;weet Meats, <HI>Betle</HI> and <HI>A|reka</HI> in fifty or &s;ixty China Di&s;hes as big as Plates, which they pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nted to their Idols, before they gave them to their <HI>Bonzes,</HI> or eat of them them|&s;elves. Upon the&s;e Degrees there were &s;e|veral Statues of Men and different Animals. In the middle of the Figures of the Men, there was one that repre&s;ented a <HI>Bonze</HI> with a very long and black Beard, attentively reading in a Book which he held very near his Eyes, as if he had been &s;hort &s;ighted. Near to him there was ano|ther Doctor with a white Beard, and a kind of Surplice, who &s;eemed to be &s;peaking in publick. As we entered into the Temple, we &s;aw &s;even or eight Prie&s;ts cloathed in their Sacerdotal Habits, pretty like to ours: He who &s;eemed to be the Superior was in the middle, and always attended by two or four, who with him performed the &s;ame Ceremonies. Behind them there were two or three Officers, who bowed their Bodies down to the Ground, when the others made but moderate Inclinations, and then other two who had each a little Bell in their Hand.</P>
<P>In a Corner near the Door, there was a Tim|breler beating upon Timbrels, to the Sound
<PB N="125" REF="80"> whereof, and of four little Bells which two Prie&s;ts who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Superior held, all came out in cadence from the Altar with a &s;low and mode&s;t Pace, making &s;ome Turns, &s;ometimes fol|lowing one another, and &s;ometimes putting them|&s;elves in a Ring, and always &s;inging in a man|ner that was not unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>During the Sacrifice, two Mini&s;ters came away from the Altar, and lighted Pa&s;tilles and Candles upon all the Altars, for be&s;ides the chief Altar that was at the end of the Chappel, there was one al&s;o on the Left-hand. When they advanced to, or returned from the Altars, they made low Bows. Now the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> &s;eeming to be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us, we told them that we were Prie&s;ts of the mo&s;t high God of Heaven and Earth, who were going to <HI>China</HI> to preach the only true Re|ligion. They gave us to under&s;tand that they knew there was a great many of our Fathers in their Country, who were very able Doctors, and highly e&s;teemed by the Emperor and great Men of the Kingdom. We had a mind to &s;ee all to the very la&s;t, but being informed that that Sa|crifice was performed for cha&s;ing the Devil out of a &s;ick Per&s;on, and that the Ceremony would continue till night; after we had &s;tayed there near an hour, we went our way; much pitying the Blindne&s;s of the&s;e People, and being very de|&s;irous to endeavour the Conver&s;ion of their Coun|try-men.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Twenty fourth, the Eve of St. <HI>Lou|is,</HI> my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador did the General the Civility to give him notice, that he would not have him to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if in the Evening he heard Guns fired in the Road, that it was the
<PB N="126" REF="81"> Cu&s;tom of the Kings Ships to honour the Fe&s;ti|val of St. <HI>Louis</HI> by &s;uch Rejoycings. The Am|ba&s;&s;ador charged another Je&s;uit and me with that Commi&s;&s;ion, and we went to the Palace when the General was at Council. So &s;oon as he was told that we waited for him, he came to us, and we made him our Compliment in the Name of the Amba&s;&s;ador. He was &s;en&s;ibly obliged by that Civility, and &s;aid that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hew'd him greater Re&s;pect than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would do in &s;uch a ca&s;e. He asked us if it was the Kings Birth-day, becau&s;e then he would take a &s;hare in our Re|joycings, and te&s;tifie his Re&s;pects for that great Monarch, by a Di&s;charge of all the Guns of the Fort and Ships. But being informed that by that publick Expre&s;&s;ion of Joy we honoured the Fe&s;ti|val of St. <HI>Louis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Name the King bore; I am very &s;orry, Fathers, &s;aid he, that I cannot do in Honour of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> what, with all my heart I would have done in Honour of <HI>Louis the Great.</HI> When we took our Leave of him, he made us a thou&s;and offers of Services, and obliged us to promi&s;e him that we would not tru&s;t our Letters to any but him, and that we &s;hould do the &s;ame when we wrote from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> that he would take that Commi&s;&s;ion upon him&s;elf, that he might entertain a Corre|&s;pondence with us. We embraced the Liberty he gave us, and entru&s;ted him with our Letters at our Departure. Being come out of the Palace we went &s;treight on board to give the Amba&s;&s;a|dor an Account of what we had done, and to Confe&s;s the Catholicks who were to be there next Morning. When we were got within three Mu&s;|quet &s;hot of the Ocean, we &s;aw her fire &s;eventeen,
<PB N="127" REF="81"> Guns, and the <HI>Maligne</HI> thirteen, which were fol|lowed by &s;everal <HI>Huzza's,</HI> and &s;ome Volleys of &s;mall Shot.</P>
<P>We were informed at <HI>Batavia,</HI> that it is not now &s;o difficult to enter into <HI>China</HI> as formerly, and that the Emperor had a mind to try whether Freedom of Trade would encrea&s;e the Wealth of his Empire or not. It is &s;aid the <HI>Dutch</HI> laid hold on that Occa&s;ion, and this Year &s;ent a &s;o|lemn Emba&s;&s;ie with Pre&s;ents to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> that they might obtain the Liberty of Commerce in his Dominions, and that upon the News thereof, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;ent al&s;o one of their Ships to <HI>Chiucheu;</HI> but that they would not let tho&s;e who were on board come a&s;hoar, and that they were obliged to return back again with the lo&s;s of their Time, Fraught and Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> in the Evening, the five and twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> all that were a&s;hoar had Orders forth|with to come on board. Before we embarked we went all &s;even to the Palace, to take our leave of the General, and to thank him for all his Ci|vilites. We promi&s;ed him never to forget his Favours, and to pray God that he would reward him in another Life. He &s;poke very obligingly to us, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Father <HI>Fucity;</HI> I was in good hopes, Father, &s;aid he, that I might have fitted you with a Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Siam</HI> in one of our Ships; but &s;eeing you will not part from your Fathers, I will not be again&s;t your De&s;ign. Once more I intreat you, that you would give me oc|ca&s;ion to &s;erve you. Having thanked him a thou&s;and times, we took our Leaves with hearts full of Gratitude. Next day he &s;ent us his Boat
<PB N="128" REF="82"> to carry us on board, and therein a great quanti|ty of fine Bisket, dry Fi&s;h, Fruit, and other Pro|vi&s;ions for Father <HI>Fucity.</HI> He knew very well that we were magnificently treated by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vaudricourt</HI> at the Amba&s;&s;adors Table, and that we wanted for nothing, but he could not tell if the &s;ame Favour would be &s;hew'd to Father <HI>Fucity.</HI> Before we parted from <HI>Batavia</HI> we in|formed our &s;elves of the Dutch Government in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the principal Points of it are as follow.</P>
<P>The General&s;hip is the highe&s;t Office: it gives him who enjoys it a Right over every thing without exception: it is given for Life, but re|vocable at the Companies plea&s;ure; the General may lay down his Place after three Years &s;ervice. The Council of State con&s;i&s;ts of the General, the Director General, and &s;ix Coun&s;ellors. The Plu|rality of Voices carries it in the Deci&s;ion of Af|fairs; but the Generals, who have commonly but two Voices pa&s;s over that Formality, when they'l an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s of any Affair. The Places of Coun&s;ellors are the Rewards of con&s;i|derable Services done to the Company. They have a Salary of two thou&s;and Livers a Month, and the General has but twelve thou&s;and Livers a Year, and the Charges of Hou&s;e-keeping defray'd. But &s;eeing he hath all in his Power, without be|ing obliged to give an Account, it may be &s;aid that he has what he plea&s;es. Every Coun&s;ellor has his Province, and the Affairs relating to it mu&s;t be managed by him. The Great or Su|pream Council, which is the highe&s;t Judicature of the Country, and judges &s;overeignly in all Cau|&s;es Civil and Criminal, con&s;i&s;ts of a Pre&s;ident, a
<PB N="129" REF="83"> Vice-pre&s;ident, and two Proctors Generals. That Tribunal may Judge and Condemn the General him&s;elf. The third Council is that of the She|riffs, who take Cogni&s;ance of Matters concerning the Town.</P>
<P>The fourth, which is like a Pre&s;idial Court in <HI>France,</HI> judges Cau&s;es of le&s;s importance, to the Sum of an hundred Crowns, without appeal. The Director General holds a &s;econd Rank; all that concerns Trade pa&s;&s;es through his Hands, and he is obliged to give an Account of it. Next to the Coun&s;ellors of State for the Government, are the Governours of the Provinces, to the number of &s;ix, of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> who re&s;ides at <HI>Pa&s;icate,</HI> of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> the Capital of which is <HI>Victoria,</HI> of <HI>Tar|nata,</HI> the King whereof hath been obliged to quit his Kingdom to the Company, and content him|&s;elf with a Pen&s;ion of twelve hundred Crowns; of <HI>Ceilan,</HI> who re&s;ides at <HI>Colombo,</HI> and la&s;tly of <HI>Malaca.</HI> This la&s;t Government has &s;ometimes Governours, and &s;ometimes none at all. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable next to the Governours of Pro|vinces, are the chief Merchants, the Comman|ders of Places, and the Pre&s;idents or Heads of Factories.</P>
<P>As for War, next to the General, all the Command re&s;ts upon the Major General. He that has that Charge at pre&s;ent is a French-man by birth, and is called the <HI>Heer St. Martin.</HI> That Command is afterwards divided among&s;t the Captains of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who are Colonels when they are abroad out of the Town. They have twelve thou&s;and Men of regimented Forces, and an hundred and fifty Ships; there is be&s;ides a Bay|liff or Commander of the Town of <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Dutch Ship that ran foul of us.</NOTE><HI>Munday</HI> morning the 26th. we put out of the Road of <HI>Batavia</HI> with a fair wind. Betwixt eight and nine a Clock in the Evening, it being pretty dark, we made all of a &s;udden a Ship as big as our own, within two Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of us, bearing down upon us before the wind. We pre&s;ently hailed her and asked who were on Board, but it was to no purpo&s;e; for no body made an&s;wer. In the mean time the wind being good &s;he was pre&s;ently up with us. By her way of working it was thought at fir&s;t &s;he intended to run us on Board in the quarter, and perceiving her low Sail furled as if &s;he had been to fight, it was not doubted but that in Boarding of us &s;he would pour in a whole Broad&s;ide. No Body was &s;tartled at that &s;urpri&s;e, but all &s;eemed ready to do their Duty. The clutter that the Seamen and Souldiers who were upon the Watch kept, &s;ome running to their Arms and others minding the Sails, &s;oon awaked tho&s;e that were a&s;leep; &s;o that in a trice all were upon the deck.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador perceiving that this Ship had run her Bolt-&s;prit into our Stern, and that no Ene|my appeared, concluded that they who were on Board had no ill de&s;ign. He thought it enough to command five and twenty or thirty &s;mall &s;hot to be fired among&s;t them, as a warning to them to be better upon their Guard another time. But the other Ship having with her Bolt-&s;prit done &s;ome damage to our Galleries, got clear of her &s;elf, without any Seamans appearing on Board.</P>
<P>That adventure occa&s;ioned various rea&s;oning. Tho&s;e of mo&s;t &s;en&s;e were of the opinion of the Amba&s;&s;ador and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vaudricourt,</HI> who at|tributed it to a carele&s;s working of the Ship.
<PB N="131" REF="84"> The truth is, if &s;he had had any bad de&s;ign, &s;he would not have failed to fire her Guns, when &s;he laid us on board, and to have poured in a volley of &s;mall-&s;hot amon&s;t us. We were informed at <HI>Siam</HI> by <HI>Hollanders</HI> that came from <HI>Batavia</HI> after us, that it was one of their Ships coming from <HI>Palimbam</HI> and that all the Men on Board were drunk or a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The wind was good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Streight of <HI>Banka</HI> diffi|cult to be pa&s;|&s;ed becau&s;e of the want of Water.</NOTE> and &s;o that accident did not at all hinder us to pur&s;ue our Voyage. It was not long before we got to the entry of the Streight of <HI>Banka,</HI> which is made by an I&s;le &s;o called and the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> The Banks and Shelves that are at the entry of this Streight, make it a difficult pa&s;&s;age for tho&s;e that are not acquainted with it. We had a Dutch Pilot on Board and a very able Man, who had &s;everal times before pa&s;t that Streight, and for all that, tho we continually al&s;o heaved the Head, our Ship &s;tuck aground, and &s;o did the Frigat too; But the Ground being owzy, we were in no danger, and having put out an Anchor at a di&s;tance in deeper water, we weighed our &s;elves off again without any prejudice.</P>
<P>The wind continuing fair in a &s;hort time we repa&s;&s;ed the Line. We felt it a great deal bet|ter in this place encompa&s;&s;ed with Land, then when we pa&s;&s;ed it the fir&s;t time out at Sea, be|fore we came to the Cape. Calms are not &s;o much to be dreaded here, becau&s;e of winds that reign there and blow &s;ometime from the Land, and &s;ometime from the Sea. The &s;afe&s;t way of Sailing in tho&s;e Calm Seas that are as &s;mooth as a Mill-pond, is to keep always along the Shoar, in twelve, fifteen or twenty Fathom water, and
<PB N="132" REF="85"> never go out of &s;ight of Land, as we did, ob&s;er|ving this circum&s;pection, you have always the advantage of coming to an Anchor when you plea&s;e, which you will be forced to do very often, becau&s;e of the Currents, that &s;et in to Land, and of certain &s;trong gu&s;ts and flurries, which com|monly blow from the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> Some days after we &s;et out from <HI>Batavia</HI> we were all of a &s;udden &s;urpri&s;ed with one of tho&s;e Flurries, which put us into great fear, becau&s;e all our Sails were then abroad; but the diligence that was u&s;ed in taking of them in, cleared us of the danger.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 5. we began to make the Land of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the fir&s;t we made was the point of <HI>Malaca.</HI> We all felt a &s;ecret Joy to &s;ee tho&s;e places that had been watered with the &s;weat of St. <HI>Francis Xavier,</HI> and to find our &s;elves in the&s;e Seas &s;o fa|mous for his Voyages and Miracles. We pub|licly and daily invoked the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that great Saint after the Litanies of the Virgin, on Board. We then ranged along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Johor, Pa|tane</HI> and <HI>Pahan,</HI> who&s;e Kings are Tributary to the King of <HI>Siam;</HI> but the Dutch have all the Trade of the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 6. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vanderets D' Hebouville</HI> one of the Gentlemen of the Amba&s;&s;adors Retinue, died on Board the Frigat, in the Flower of his Age. He was hand&s;ome, Di&s;creet, and the elde&s;t Son of a very Ancient and Rich Family in <HI>Nor|mandy.</HI> His Di&s;temper was a Bloody-Flux, com|mon enough in the <HI>Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who eat too much Fruit, as this young Gentleman did during the five or &s;ix days that he was at <HI>Batavia.</HI> We had notice of his Death by the Frigats hand|ling their Colours at eight of the Clock in the
<PB N="133" REF="85"> Morning, and in the Evening we came to know the time of his ob&s;equies, by means of five Guns &s;lowly fired one after another.</P>
<P>Funerals at Sea are performed with like Cere|monie. Having &s;ung &s;ome Prayers, they wrap up the Body in a Linnen Cloath, tye a great &s;hot to the Feet, and upon a Plank to which it is made fa&s;t, let it gently drop into the Sea. Next day all we that were Prie&s;ts, &s;aid a Ma&s;s on Board of our Ship, for the re&s;t of his Soul.</P>
<P>At length, <HI>September</HI> 22. we came in &s;ight of the River of <HI>Siam,</HI> and next day to an Anchor three Leagues from the Bar, which is at the entry of it. The &s;ight of that Kingdom rai&s;ed an incredible Joy in all of us, after the dangers and fatigues of &s;o tedious a Voyage. There had been but little talk till then of the Conver&s;ion of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> which was the cau&s;e of the Em|ba&s;&s;ie, but at that time it was almo&s;t the &s;ubject of every di&s;cour&s;e. It was known to all that the King had publickly &s;aid to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador that he was in hopes, that by his prudent Con|duct he would accomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h that great work which was &s;o far advanced. We earne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">y begg'd it of God in our prayers, and from our fir&s;t coming on Board, our Father Superiour had ordered every one of us to &s;ay a Ma&s;s weekly for that intention.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we were come to an Anchor, the Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;patched the <HI>Chevalier de Fourbin</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vachet</HI> with the news of his arrival to the King of <HI>Siam</HI> and his Mini&s;ters. The fir&s;t was to go no higher than <HI>Bancok</HI> which is the fir&s;t place of the Kingdom upon the River, ten Leagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s from the mouth of it, and the other was to take a <HI>Balon,</HI> which is a Boat of that Countrey very
<PB N="134" REF="86"> light, and make all ha&s;t to <HI>Siam.</HI> The Governor of <HI>Bancok</HI> by Nation a <HI>Turk</HI> and of the Mahome|tan Religion, being informed that the Amba&s;&s;ador of the King of <HI>France</HI> was in the Road, prayed Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vachet</HI> to take his repo&s;e for the re&s;t of that night, and &s;uffer him to &s;end an expre&s;s, that he might give the Court &s;peedy notice there|of.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Bancoks</HI> Me&s;&s;enger arrived at <HI>Siam</HI> next day about noon. The Lord <HI>Con|&s;tance</HI> Mini&s;ter of State, was acquainted by a Letter which he had received that Morning from <HI>Coromandel,</HI> that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had named the <HI>Chevalier de Chaumont</HI> to be his Am|ba&s;&s;ador extraordinary at the Court of <HI>Siam,</HI> and that he had &s;et out from <HI>France</HI> ever &s;ince the Month of <HI>March</HI> with two Men of War. Seeing we are often to mention this Mini&s;ter in the &s;e|quel of this relation, and that he alone was depu|ted by the King his Ma&s;ter to treat about the Affairs of this Emba&s;&s;ie, it is proper we &s;hould make it known who he is.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> is properly called <HI>Con&s;tan|tin Phaulkon,</HI> and &s;o he writes his name. He is a <HI>Grecian</HI> by Nation born in <HI>Cephalonia,</HI> his Father being a noble <HI>Venetian</HI> the Son of the Governor of the I&s;land, and his Mother a Daughter of one of the Anciente&s;t Families of the Country. About the year 1660. when as yet he was but about twelve years of Age, he had di&s;cretion enough to reflect upon the bad condition into which his Pa|rents had reduced the Affairs of his Family. The thought of that made him take a Re&s;olution that could hardly be expected from a Child of his years. Not being able to &s;upport his quality in his own
<PB N="135" REF="86"> Countrey he went on Board with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, who was returning into <HI>England.</HI> His wit and &s;pright|line&s;s, his compliant humour, and agreeable Car|riage quickly made him be known, and gained him the kindne&s;s of &s;ome of the Lords of Court, but de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s there, he went to Sea with a de&s;ign to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI> His purpo&s;e was to rai&s;e his Fortune, his Genius put him in the way of it, and if his probity had been le&s;s, he might in a &s;hort time have got a con&s;iderable E&s;tate. But he cho&s;e rather to pa&s;s through all the degrees of Seafaring, and to ri&s;e by little and little with Reputation, than to ha&s;ten to be Rich all of a &s;udden by &s;neaking and unlawful ways.</P>
<P>Having lived &s;ome years at <HI>Siam,</HI> and &s;craped together a little E&s;tate, He re&s;olved to quit the Service of the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI>-Company, to get a Ship of his own, and to Trade by him&s;elf. He had much ado to get out of <HI>Siam,</HI> being de|tained by his Friends, and by his effects which he could not as yet get in. At length he put out, but was beaten back again by bad weather, and was ca&s;t away twice in the mouth of the River.</P>
<P>Putting out again to Sea once more, he was Shipwracked a third time and much more unfor|tunately, upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar;</HI> he was in danger of having peri&s;hed there, and could not &s;ave of all he had above two thou&s;and Crowns. In this &s;ad condition being oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;orrow, wearine&s;s and &s;leep, he had laid him&s;elf down upon the Shore, when, whether he was a&s;leep or awake, for he hath prote&s;ted to me oftner than once he could not tell him&s;elf, he thought he &s;aw a Per&s;on full of Maje&s;ty, who looking upon him
<PB N="136" REF="87"> with a &s;miling eye, mo&s;t mildly &s;aid unto him; <HI>Return, Return from whence you came:</HI> The&s;e words &s;o wrought upon him, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;leep all the re&s;t of the night, and his thoughts were wholly taken up about finding a way to return to <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>Next day whil&s;t he walked by the Sea &s;ide, mu&s;ing upon what he had &s;een in the night time, and uncertain what to think of it, he &s;aw a Man coming towards him dropping wet with a &s;ad and dejected countenance. It was an Amba&s;&s;ador of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> who upon his return from <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> had been ca&s;t away, without &s;aving any thing but his life. Since both of them &s;poke <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> they &s;oon acquainted one another with their ad|ventures. The Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;covered him&s;elf, and told what extreme nece&s;&s;ity he was reduced to. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> condoling his misfortune, of|fered to carry him back to <HI>Siam:</HI> and with the two thou&s;and Crowns that he had &s;aved after his Ship|wreck, he bought a &s;mall Barque, cloaths for him&s;elf and the Amba&s;&s;ador, and Victuals for their Pa&s;&s;age. This &s;o obliging a Conduct charmed the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Siam,</HI> who from that time for|ward ca&s;t about every way how he might te&s;tifie to him his gratitude.</P>
<P>When they arrived at <HI>Siam,</HI> and that the Am|ba&s;&s;ador had given account of his Negotiation and Shipwreck to <HI>Barcalon</HI> who is the fir&s;t Mini|&s;ter of State in the Kingdom, he told him all the good Offices which he had received from <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Con&s;tance,</HI> with &s;o great applau&s;e to his merit, that the Mini&s;ter had a mind to know him. He entertained him in di&s;cour&s;e, liked him, and re|&s;olved to keep him about him; where he &s;oon
<PB N="137" REF="87"> gained the e&s;teem and confidence of his Ma&s;ter. This <HI>Barcalon</HI> was a witty Man, and well ver&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s, but he avoided trouble as much as he could and loved his plea&s;ures. It ravi&s;hed him that he had found an able, faithful and indu&s;tri|ous Per&s;on on whom he might repo&s;e the cares of his place. Nay he often &s;poke of him to the King; but that which contributed mo&s;t to beget a good Opinion of him in the mind of that Prince, was the occa&s;ion that I am about to relate.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador into a Foreign Kingdom; and &s;ee|ing he loves Magnificence and Grandeur, he was willing to &s;pare no co&s;t that he might render it famous by rich and &s;plend d Pre&s;ents. The <HI>Mores</HI> to whom he u&s;ually addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, demanded of him pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">digious &s;ums of Mo|ney to &s;et out that Emba&s;&s;ie in the manner he de|&s;ired it &s;hould be.

The King would here|upon know the opinion of the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> and put the memoirs of the <HI>Mores</HI> into his hand, &s;o &s;oon as he had examined it, he told the King, that he was cheated, and that his Maje&s;ty was &s;o far from owing them any thing, that they &s;tood indebted to him in three&s;core thou&s;and Crowns. The <HI>Mori&s;h</HI> Captain was fain to acknowledge it before the Commi&s;&s;ioners whom the King depu|ted to enquire into the bu&s;ine&s;s, that they had been mi&s;taken in their accounts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Barcalon</HI> dying not long after, the King would needs put Mon&s;ieur <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> in his place. He declined it, and made an&s;wer to his Maje&s;ty, that that po&s;t would rai&s;e him the envy of all the great Men, that he mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought him not to rai&s;e him higher than he was, for that was all his Ambition, being happy enough in that he &s;tood fair in his Favours. His mode&s;ty, his skill in affairs and diligence in di&s;patching them, his Fidelity in managing the publick Revenue, and his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in refu&s;ing both the appoint|ments of his Office, and all pre&s;ents from pri|vate people, have more and more encrea&s;ed the Kings confidence in him. At pre&s;ent every thing pa&s;&s;es through his hands, and there is nothing done without him. However his greatne&s;s hath not at all changed him, he is ea&s;ie to be &s;poken with, mild and affable to all People, always ready to li&s;ten to the poor, and to do ju&s;tice to the meane&s;t of the Kingdom. He is the refuge of the wretch|ed and afflicted; but the great Men and Officers who do not do their Duty, think him &s;evere and moro&s;e.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="88">
<P>Seeing he left his own Countrey when he was young, and by con&s;equence but little in&s;tructed in the Catholic Religion, wherein he was bred, it was no hard matter for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to make him embrace the Prote&s;tant Religion, which &s;eemed to him to differ little from his own. But having had &s;ince &s;ome Conferences with Father <HI>Thomas</HI> and Father <HI>Maldonat</HI> of our Company, for whom he &s;till retains a kind Friend&s;hip, and be|ing convinced in his own Judgment of the bad way he had been put into, after full in&s;truction he left it, and abjured his Here&s;ie to Father <HI>Tho|mas.</HI> Since that time, he hath led a very regu|lar and edifying Life, and by his Example and Credit contributes much to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Catholic Faith, as will appear by the Sequel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the King of <HI>Siam</HI> was informed by his Mini&s;ter of the Honour the King of <HI>France</HI> did him, by the &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y he &s;ent to him, and was told that the Amba&s;&s;ador was arrived at the Mouth of the River, he was over-joyed, and publickly expre&s;&s;ed it to all his Court.

He gave Orders that at every five Leagues di&s;tance, neat Hou&s;es &s;hould be forthwith built on the Ri|ver &s;ide, and very &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;hed; and that as far as <HI>Tabangue,</HI> an hours journey from <HI>Siam,</HI> where my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was to &s;tay, till all things were ready for his Reception.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis,</HI> Vicar Apo&s;tolic of a great part of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="89"> came on board, and the Abbot of <HI>Lyonne</HI> with him. They were received with all the Marks of E&s;teem and Re&s;pect that were due to the Dig|nity of the one, and the Quality of the other. The Amba&s;&s;ador and Bi&s;hop after Ma&s;s &s;hut up them&s;elves together, and had a long Conference upon the Subject of the Emba&s;&s;ie.</P>
<P>Though we had had the Honour to ki&s;s the Bi&s;hop's Hands when he came on board, yet our Father Superior judged it convenient, that we &s;hould again all &s;ix together go and pay our mo&s;t humble Re&s;pects to him. This Prelate, who is a per&s;on of a very &s;weet and good Nature, received us with all te&s;timonies of Joy and Affection: Nay he offered us his Seminary to live in &s;o long as we &s;hould be at <HI>Siam;</HI> telling us, that the Hou&s;e of the Company was too &s;mall to accom|modate us all. And we rendered him our hearty Thanks for his Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>At that time the two great <HI>Mandarins</HI> whom the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ent to his Excellence, came on board of us in a Galley. They were introduced into the Amba&s;&s;ador's Cabin, that was &s;pred with a Foot-Carpet: Being come in, they &s;ate down upon the Carpet; and then the Elder of the two asked my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador in the Name of the King his Ma&s;ter, News of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and of all the Royal Family, and congratulated his happy Arrival. He added, according to the Vi&s;ions of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> wherewith mo&s;t of the Orientals are infatuated, that he well knew his Excellence had heretofore been employed in great Affairs, and that it was above a thou&s;and years &s;ince he came to <HI>Siam</HI> to renew the Friend|&s;hip of the Kings who at that time governed the
<PB N="142" REF="90"> two Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Siam.</HI> The Am|ba&s;&s;ador having very civilly an&s;wered their Com|plements, added with a Smile, that he did not remember he had ever been charged with &s;o im|portant a Negotiation, and that this was the fir&s;t Voyage he had ever made to <HI>Siam.</HI> After a &s;hort &s;tay, they took leave, a&s;&s;uring the Amba&s;&s;ador, that the King was impatient to &s;ee him: and that he had ordered the luckie&s;t day of the Year to be pitched upon for his Reception. They were &s;erved with Tea and Sweet Meats; and one of them, who was a very hand&s;om man, and of a plea&s;ant a&s;pect, drank Wine; but the other would not &s;o much as ta&s;te it. So they went into their Galley again, where they wrote down all they had &s;een and heard in this Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening our Father Supe|rior would have me go before with Father <HI>Vi&s;delou</HI> and Father <HI>Bouvet,</HI> to take order about our Affairs. There offered a very fair occa&s;ion by the return of the Bi&s;hop and Abbot of <HI>Lyonne,</HI> who were to part next day, and who offered us their <HI>Balons.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;ador commanded the <HI>Chevalier de Fourbin</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier du Fay</HI> to wait upon the Bi&s;hop and Abbot, who went into the Cha|loop; where we had the honour to accompany them, becau&s;e their <HI>Balons</HI> were not &s;trong e|nough to come on board.</P>
<P>Pretty late in the Evening we got to the mouth of the River; at that place it is but a &s;hort League over; half a League further up, it is not a quarter of a League over; and a little higher, it is not at the broade&s;t place above an hundred and three&s;core paces or thereabouts over. It has a very fair pretty deep Channel. The Bar is a Bank of
<PB N="243" REF="90"> Owze lying in the mouth of it, where there is not above thirteen foot water when the Tides are at the highe&s;t. There is nothing more charm|ing than the &s;ight of that River, the Banks on both &s;ides being covered over with Trees always green, and beyond them there being nothing but va&s;t Plains reaching out of &s;ight covered with Rice. It was Night when we put a&s;hoar at a little Lodging where the <HI>Balons</HI> of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis</HI> &s;tayed for him. Seeing the Countrey about within a days Journey of <HI>Siam,</HI> is very low Land; it is all overflowed for one half of the year. The Rains which fall for &s;everal Months together &s;welling the River, cau&s;e the&s;e great In|undations, and that's the thing which makes the Countrey &s;o fertil; were it not for that the Rice that grows only in Water, and wherewith all the Fields are covered, could not &s;upply, as it does, all the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> and neighbouring Countries with Food. This is another Convenience of the&s;e Inundations, that one may go all about in a <HI>Balon,</HI> even into the Fields; which makes &s;o great a number of Boats to be in all places, that in the greate&s;t part of the Kingdom there are more <HI>Balons</HI> than Men. There are &s;ome of them very big, covered with Hou&s;es, which &s;erve to lodge whole Families; and &s;everal of the&s;e being joyned together, make a kind of floating Villages in tho&s;e places where they chance to meet.</P>
<P>We continued going up the River all night long, during which we &s;aw a very plea&s;ant &s;ight, and that was an infinite number of Fire-flies, wherewith all the Trees upon the &s;ides of the Ri|ver were &s;o covered over, that they appeared like &s;o many great Branches &s;et thick with innumera|ble
<PB N="144" REF="91"> Lights, which the reflection of the Water, at that time as &s;mooth as a Looking-gla&s;s, infinitely multiplied. Whil&s;t we were taken up in viewing of them, all of a &s;udden we were be&s;et with a prodigious quantity of Musketo's or <HI>Maringoiiins.</HI> The&s;e are a kind of very trouble&s;om Gnats, that &s;ting through Peoples Cloaths, and leave the Marks of it a long time behind them. The <HI>Sia|me&s;e</HI> who row'd our <HI>Balon,</HI> though they were na|ked, and tugg'd at the Oar, made a better &s;hift again&s;t them than we; they gave them&s;elves a flap with the hand every time they felt a Muske|toe, and &s;truck &s;o pat that they never mi&s;&s;ed them, without lo&s;ing one &s;ingle &s;troak of their Oar for all that.</P>
<P>We found a great many Monkeys and <HI>Sapa|jous</HI> upon the River &s;ide, which clambered up the Trees, and went together in Troops. But no plea&s;eanter &s;ight can be &s;een than the va&s;t num|bers of <HI>Criel Herons</HI> that &s;warm upon the Trees; at a di&s;tance one would take them for their Blo&s;|&s;oms. The White of the Birds mingling with the Green of the Trees, makes the mo&s;t lovely Land-skip imaginable. The <HI>Criel Heron</HI> is a Fowl &s;haped like a common Heron, but far le&s;s; it is of a neat proportion of Body, and has fair Fea|thers whiter than Snow. It hath Tops or Tufts upon the Head, Back and Belly, wherein its chief Beauty con&s;i&s;ts, and which render it extraordi|nary.</P>
<P>All the wild Birds have mo&s;t lovely Feathers, there are of them of &s;everal colours, all yellow, all red, all blew, all green, and that in great numbers: For the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> believing the Tran&s;mi|gration of Souls into other Bodies, kill no Ani|mals,
<PB N="145" REF="92"> for fear, as they &s;ay&punc; of driving out from thence the Souls of their Relations, which may very well be lodged there.</P>
<P>We did not make a League of way with|out meeting with &s;ome Pagod, that is to &s;ay, a Temple of Idols. It hath always by it a little Mona&s;tery of <HI>Talapoins,</HI> who are the Prie&s;ts and the Religious of the Countrey. The&s;e <HI>Talapoins</HI> live in common, and their Hou&s;es are &s;o many Seminaries, where the Children of Quality are bred.</P>
<P>So long as Children continue there, they wear the habit of <HI>Telapoins,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in two pieces of a kind of yellow Cotton Cloth, whereof the one &s;erves to cover them from the Girdle down to the Knees, and the other, they u&s;e &s;ometimes as a Scarf, putting it about their Shoulders like a Shoulder-Belt; and &s;ometimes they wrap it about them like a little Cloak. They have their Heads and Eye-brows &s;haved as well as their Ma&s;ters, who are per&s;waded that it would be immode&s;t and &s;inful to let them grow: Their Blindne&s;s made us heartily pity them.</P>
<P>Having row'd on all night long, about Ten of the Clock in the Morning we arrived at <HI>Bancok.</HI> This is the mo&s;t important Place of the Kingdom, becau&s;e it defends the Pa&s;&s;age of the River with a Fort that is on the other &s;ide. Both are well fur|ni&s;hed with Bra&s;s Guns, but ill fortified. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Mare</HI> a French Engineer, whom my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador left at <HI>Siam,</HI> hath received Orders from the King to fortifie it regularly, and to make a good place of it. We &s;aw the Governor of it in pa&s;&s;ing; he is a tall very hand&s;om man, who received us with a great deal of Civility.
<PB N="146" REF="93"> We went afterwards to dine with a <HI>French Arti&s;an;</HI> for there are no Inns in that Countrey. That day we began to u&s;e Rice in&s;tead of Bread, and to drink nothing but River-water. The Rice being on|ly boiled with Water, is but an in&s;ipid kind of Food, and we could hardly accu&s;tom our &s;elve to it at fir&s;t, but within a Fortnights time we came to like it as well as Bread, which is very &s;carce and dear there, becau&s;e the Wheat mu&s;t be brought from <HI>Surrat</HI> or <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>Betwixt <HI>Bancock</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> you meet with a great many <HI>Aldees</HI> or Villages, that almo&s;t eve|ry where border the River. The&s;e Villages are no more than a great many Huts or Hovels rai&s;|ed upon high Pillars, becau&s;e of the Inundation. They are made of <HI>Bambous,</HI> which is a Tree who&s;e Timber is much u&s;ed in that Countrey. The Trunk and great Branches &s;erve for making of Pillars and Joy&s;ts, and the &s;mall Branches to makes the Walls and Roof. Near the Villages are the <HI>Bazars</HI> or floating Market-places, where the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> who go up or down the River, find their Victuals ready dre&s;t; that's to &s;ay, Fruit, boyl'd Rice, <HI>Rack</HI> (which is a kind of Strong Water made of Rice and Lime) and &s;ome <HI>Ra|gou&s;ts</HI> after the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Mode, which a French-man could not ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Next day, the Third of <HI>October,</HI> we came to <HI>Siam.</HI> We thought the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis</HI> had got before us, and therefore went &s;treight to the Seminary, to pay him our dutiful Re&s;pects at home; but he was not as yet arrived. Whil&s;t we &s;tayed for him, we &s;aid Ma&s;s, to give God thanks for his Protection during all our Voyage, which had been exactly &s;even Months long; for

We pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> Fa|ctory, and there &s;aluted the Officers of the Com|pany.

We knew before that he was a man of Merit, and had a kindne&s;s for us; but we had the experience of both far beyond our expectati|on. In that fir&s;t Interview, he gave us many Te&s;timonies of Goodne&s;s, we thanked him for the <HI>Balon</HI> which he &s;ent to meet us, and for the Cham|bers that he was plea&s;ed to order to be built for us near to Father <HI>Suarez,</HI> who&s;e Hou&s;e was too little to accommodate us with Lodgings. He told us that it was plea&s;ure to him to oblige us; and that he did but his Duty, when he built an Appartment for his Brethren (for &s;o he did us the honour to call us) &s;eeing he could not lodge us in his own hou&s;e; that moreover he expected more Je&s;uits, whom he had demanded from the Father General at lea&s;t a year ago. Then he &s;hewed us all the Appartments of the Am|ba&s;&s;ador's Palace, which we thuught very hand&s;om and neat.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> had ordered a &s;tately Hou&s;e to be built for the Amba&s;&s;ador; but &s;eeing it was not as yet fini&s;hed, and that there was no delay to be made becau&s;e of the Sea&s;on that pre&s;&s;ed his

All together perform before his Maje&s;ty the <HI>Zombaye,</HI> which is a profound inclination of the body; and then come creeping along upon hands and knees, till they come to the middle of the Court; then rai&s;ing them&s;elves thrice on their knees, with their hand joyned upon their head, they bow down and knock their forehead as often again&s;t the ground. When that is done, they advance, creeping as before till they come to a pair of &s;tairs betwixt the two Halls where the great Men are pro&s;trate, and there having made the <HI>Zombaye,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador waits till the King do him the honour to &s;peak to him.

<P>In public Audiences the&s;e <HI>Mandarins</HI> are betwixt the Amba&s;&s;ador and chief Mini&s;ter, to carry the word from the one to the other.

<P>As he enters the Palace, he &s;its down upon the ground, and lays his hands upon his head, which is a mark of the profound re&s;pect he pays to his Maje&s;ty.

<P>The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> thought him&s;elf much ho|noured by that Commi&s;&s;ion, and came to wait on his Excellence.

The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at it, and told the Amba&s;&s;ador, that it was the thing in the World which he mo&s;t de&s;ired, but that there was no ap|pearance of effecting it; that the King was ex|treamly addicted to the Religion of his Ance&s;tors, and that he would be &s;trangely &s;tartled at an O|verture for which he was not at all prepared; that he adjured the Amba&s;&s;ador not to &s;peak of that Affair, which without doubt, would cau&s;e Di&s;order in the pre&s;ent Junctures, and could pro|duce no Good.

<P>Then they treated about the manner how the Amba&s;&s;ador's Gentlemen &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the Audience, for they would have had them either not to come at all, or that they &s;hould be in a Po&s;ture of profound Humility.</P>
<P>My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was po&s;itive that they &s;hould enter with him into the Hall of Audience, and &s;tay there as long as he did. It was to no purpo&s;e for the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> to tell him that it was a new thing, and never practi&s;ed at the Court of <HI>Siam,</HI> and that the King would hardly conde&s;cend to that; that the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin</HI> and <HI>Cochinchine</HI> them&s;elves came

The Mini&s;ter thought the&s;e Propo&s;als rea&s;onable; but &s;eeing he knew how nice the King would be upon that Point, he prayed the Amba&s;&s;ador to give him time to &s;peak of it to his Maje&s;ty; whereupon, after a long Conference they parted full of E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip for one another. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> managed that Affair &s;o well, that the King grant|ed the Amba&s;&s;ador all that he de&s;ired; and &s;o there was no more now to be done, but to com|pleat the Preparatives of the Entry.</P>

On his Right and Left-hand he had &s;ix Gallies of the Guards, in which were the Trumpets, Drums, and other In&s;truments that go before the King when he goes abroad publickly. He was followed by four of the Kings <HI>Balons,</HI> where his Gentlemen and Servants were; after them came &s;o va&s;t and confu&s;ed a number of great and &s;mall <HI>Balons</HI> of all the Nations, that they covered the <HI>Menam,</HI> which is the Name of the River, and in the <HI>Siam</HI> Language, &s;ignifies <HI>the Mother of Waters.</HI> That long Train of <HI>Ba|lons</HI> of State which advanced in good order to the number of an hundred and fifty, and a Crowd of others covered over all the River as far as ones Sight could reach, and made a plea|&s;ant Show.

<PB N="164" REF="105"> wherein it was. This poor <HI>Mandarin</HI> committed a great fault, when he thought that he did very well; he was puni&s;hed for it upon the Spot, and had his Head pricked, as an Earne&s;t of a &s;everer Cha&s;ti&s;e|ment.

It con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;pacious Courts encompa&s;&s;ed with Walls and containing &s;ome Piles of Building; on one &s;ide are the Apartments of the Kings Officers, and on the other a great number of Pavilions, where the Elephants are. There are a great ma|ny Pagods in it al&s;o, both great and &s;mall, which though irregular, make &s;till an Object plea&s;ing enough to the Eye. When we came to the fir&s;t Gate of the Palace all alighted, and my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador went and took the Letter out of the Triumphant Chariot, and gave it to the Abbot <HI>de Choi&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner we entered into the fir&s;t Court of the Palace, where on one &s;ide were fifty Ele|phants of War harne&s;&s;ed with Gold, and on the other two Regiments of Guards, to the number of eight hundred Men drawn up in Batalia. From thence we advanced into the &s;econd Court, where were eight Elephants of War more, and a Troop
<PB N="166" REF="106"> of three&s;core <HI>Mores</HI> on Hor&s;eback; they were armed with Lances, and had a very good Meen. In the third Court were &s;ixty Elephants, with Har|ne&s;s richer than the fir&s;t, and two Regiments of Life-Guards that made two thou&s;and Men under their Arms. Upon entering into the fourth Court, which had one half the Pavement cover|ed with Mats, we found two hundred Souldiers who wore Sabres adorned with Gold and <HI>Tambag,</HI> called by the <HI>Portugues, Os Bracos Pintados,</HI> becau&s;e their Arms are painted Red. The&s;e Soldiers are the Rowers of the Kings <HI>Balon,</HI> and as it were, the Guards of the Channel. In two Halls more forward there were five hundred <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> of the Kings Guard &s;itting on the Ground cro&s;s-legg'd, becau&s;e in the Kings Palace no Man is &s;uffered to be upon his Legs, unle&s;s he be going, and all the <HI>Siam</HI> Soldiers were &s;quatted upon the Tail, holding their Arms betwixt their joyned Hands.</P>
<P>The fifth Court into which we entered, was covered with fine Mats, on which lay pro&s;trate all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the third, fourth, and fifth Order, and at a little di&s;tance tho&s;e of the &s;econd Order were in the &s;ame Po&s;ture upon Per&s;ian Carpets. Having pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t all the <HI>Manda|rins,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ed &s;o many Courts, we came at length to the foot of a pair of Stairs, where on the Right-hand were two Elephants covered all o|ver with Gold, and on the Left, &s;ix Per&s;ian Hor|&s;es, part of who&s;e Saddles and Stirrups were of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, and their Harne&s;s &s;et with Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies and Emeralds. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador &s;topt there, and the Gentlemen going up to the Hall of Audience, where the King
<PB N="167" REF="106"> was not come as yet, &s;ate down upon Per&s;ian Carpets over again&s;t the Throne, at twenty Pa|ces di&s;tance, as it had been agreed upon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cription of the Throne of the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> This Throne, to &s;peak properly, is no more but a large Window rai&s;ed &s;even or eight foot higher than the half Pace, and an&s;wering to the middle of the Hall. On the Right and Left-Hand were two great Para&s;&s;ols of Cloth of Gold, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even or eight Stories, who&s;e Staves were of beaten Gold, and &s;o high that they almo&s;t touch|ed the Cieling. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis,</HI> the Abbot of <HI>Lyonne,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vachet,</HI> &s;ate in the Hall in the &s;ame manner as the Gentlemen did, near the Seat which was prepared for the Amba&s;|&s;ador. In that Hall the Princes, Mini&s;ters and <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the fir&s;t Order lay pro&s;trate, to the Right and Left, according to their Rank and Quality.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of Princes at the Court of <HI>Siam;</HI> the fir&s;t are the Princes of the Blood Royal of <HI>Camboie,</HI> and other Kingdoms that are Tributary to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> The &s;econd are the Princes of <HI>Laos, Chiamay,</HI> and <HI>Banca,</HI> who have been taken in the Wars, and &s;ome others that have voluntarily put them&s;elves under the Kings Protection. The third are tho&s;e whom the King has rai&s;ed to the Degree of Princes; every one of them had before them great Cups of Gold and Silver, which are the Badges of their Dignity, and they lay pro&s;trate with profound Si|lence, expecting the coming of the King. Some|time after all were thus placed, a great Noi&s;e of Trumpets, Drums, and many other In&s;truments was heard, and then the Throne was opened, and the King appeared &s;itting on it. But he was to
<PB N="168" REF="107"> be &s;een only to the Girdle, the re&s;t being hid by the Front of the Window. All the pro&s;trate <HI>Man|darins</HI> ro&s;e up upon their Knees, and having their Hands joyned over their Heads, made pro|found Inclinations of Body, and knocked their Foreheads again&s;t the Ground: The King wore a <HI>Tiara</HI> all &s;hining with precious Stones. It is a long Cap ending in a Point like a Pyramid, en|compa&s;&s;ed with three Rings of Gold, at &s;ome di|&s;tance from one another. On his Fingers he wore a great many large Diamonds that ca&s;t a great Lu&s;ter, his Ve&s;t was Red on a Ground of Gold, and over that he had a Gaze of Gold with Buttons of big Diamonds; all the&s;e Orna|ments, together with a brisk Air, full of Life, and always &s;miling, made him look with a great deal of Gracefulne&s;s and Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Amba&s;|&s;ador enters the Hall of Audience.</NOTE>No &s;ooner was the Amba&s;&s;ador adverti&s;ed by the Noi&s;e of the In&s;truments that the King was come, but he entred the Hall, followed by the <HI>Abbot de Choi&s;i</HI> and the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance.</HI> Having advanced four Steps, and looking upon the King, as if that had been the fir&s;t time he had perceived him; he made a Bow to the Ground, a &s;econd he made in the middle of the Hall, and a third when he was come near to the Seat that was prepared for him. The King an&s;wered every Bow he made by an Inclination of Body, which he accompanied with a &s;erene and &s;miling Coun|tenance. Then my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador began his Compliments in this manner, and having uttered the fir&s;t Words, &s;ate down and put on his Hat.</P>

<P>THe King my Ma&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Harangue of the French Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> at pre&s;ent &s;o famous in the World by His great Victories, and the Peace be hath &s;o often given His Enemies at the Head of His Armies, hath commanded me to wait upon Your Maje&s;ty, and to a&s;&s;ure You of the particular E&s;teem He hath conceived for Your Per&s;on: He knows, Sir, Your Augu&s;t Qualities, the Wi&s;dom of Your Government, the Magnificence of Your Court, the Greatne&s;s of Your Dominions, and what particularly You were willing that He &s;hould know by Your Amba&s;&s;adors, the E&s;teem You have for Him, confirmed by that con&s;tant Protection which You give His Subjects, e&s;pecially the Bi&s;hops who are by me, and who are the Mini&s;ters of the true God.</P>
<P>He is very &s;en&s;ible of the many Illu&s;trious Effects of the E&s;teem You have for Him; and He re&s;olves, Sir, to corre&s;pond with it to the utmo&s;t of His Power. In that De&s;ign He is ready to treat with Your Maje&s;ty, to &s;end You of His Subjects to entertain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd encrea&s;e Commerce, to give You all the Te&s;timonies of a &s;in|cere Friend&s;hip, and to begin betwixt the two Crowns an &V;nion that may remain as &s;trict to Po&s;terity, as Your Territories are &s;eparated from His by tho&s;e va&s;t Seas that disjoyn them. But nothing will more con|firm Him in that Re&s;olution, nor unite You more clo&s;ely together, than to live in the Sentiments of the &s;ame Belief.</P>
<P>And it is that particularly, Sir, which the King my Ma&s;ter, a Prince &s;o Wi&s;e and Sharp &s;ighted, tbat He hath always given good Coun&s;el to the Kings that are His Allies, hath commanded me to repre&s;ent to You on His Part.

<P>To &s;ubmit Your Grandure to this God who governs Heaven and Earth, is much more Rational, Sir, than to refer them to the other Deities that are wor&s;hiped in the Ea&s;t, who&s;e Impotence, Your Maje&s;ty, who hath &s;o much Light and Penetration, cannot but ea&s;ily &s;ee.</P>
<P>But it will be made far more palpable to You, Sir, if You'l be plea&s;ed for &s;ome time, to give a Hearing to the Bi&s;hops and other Mi&s;&s;ionaries that are here. It will be the welcome&s;t News that I can carry to my Ma&s;ter, Sir, that Your Maje&s;ty being convinced of the Truth, takes pains to be in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion. This will rai&s;e in Him a greater E&s;teem and Admiration for Your Maje&s;ty, and make His Sub|jects more eager to come into Your Dominions; and in a Word, Sir, will compleat Yoor Glory, &s;eeing by that Means, Your Maje&s;ty, having &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly Reigned upon Earth, makes &s;ure of an Eternal Reign in the Heavens.</P>

<P>The Bi&s;hop told the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> in <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> the Sen&s;e of his Excellencies Complement, and that Mini&s;ter explained it to the King in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> keeping in the mean while in a very re|&s;pectful Po&s;ture, as the other Princes and Lords did, who &s;till continued pro&s;trate in the Hall at his Side, but a little lower. It would be no ea|&s;ie matter to de&s;cribe the Joy and Gladne&s;s which
<PB N="171" REF="108"> King of <HI>Siam</HI> expre&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion and during the whole Day.</P>
<P>It was a Surpri&s;e to the Amba&s;&s;ador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what man|ner the Am|ba&s;&s;ador pre|&s;ented the Kings Letter to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> when he entered the Hall, to &s;ee the King &s;o high above him, and he &s;eemed &s;omewhat troubled that he had not been told of it. When his Complement was made, the next thing he was to do in cour&s;e, was to advance and pre&s;ent the King his Ma&s;ters Letter to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> It was agreed up|on with the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> that to &s;hew great|er Re&s;pect to the Kings Letter, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould take it from the <HI>Abbot de Choi&s;i,</HI> who for that end &s;hould &s;tand by his Side during his Speech, and hold the Letter in a golden Cup with a very long Foot. But the Amba&s;&s;ador perceiving the King &s;o high above him, that to reach up to him he mu&s;t have taken the Cup by the lower part of the Foot, and rai&s;ed his Arm very high, thought that that Di&s;tance &s;uited not with his Dignity, and that he ought to pre&s;ent the Letter nearer hand. Having a little con&s;i|dered, he thought it was his be&s;t Cour&s;e to hold the Cup by the Boul, and to &s;tretch his Arm but half out. The King perceiving the rea&s;on why he acted &s;o, ro&s;e up &s;miling, and &s;tooping with his Body over the Throne, met him half way to receive the Letter: He then put it upon his Head which was a Mark of extraordinary Honour and E&s;teem that he was willing to &s;hew to the great King that &s;ent it. After that he made an&s;wer to the Amba&s;&s;ador, that he was extreamly obliged to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty for the Honour he did him, and that he had no greater de&s;ire than to entertain an eternal Peace and Amity with his Maje&s;ty. He then asked him about that Princes
<PB N="172" REF="109"> Health, whom he always called his good Friend, and about the Health of all the Royal Family, and expre&s;&s;ed his Gladne&s;s that his Excellence and all his Retinue were arrived in good Health.</P>

The King li&s;tned to him with a great deal of &s;atisfaction, and then turned the Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Amba&s;&s;adors, whom he had &s;ent into <HI>France,</HI> of whom he had no News. He enlar|ged a pretty while upon the Prai&s;es of the King, &s;eeming overjoyed to hear what the Amba&s;&s;ador told him of his Greatne&s;s, Wi&s;dom, Conque&s;ts, and of the Peace which he had given to <HI>Europe,</HI> In fine, he bid tell the Amba&s;&s;ador, that if he &s;tood in need of any thing in his Kingdom for him&s;elf and Followers, he &s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf to his <HI>Barcalon,</HI> whom he had expre&s;ly charged to &s;atisfie him in all things.

<P>Amba&s;&s;adors have never more than two Audi|ences at the Court of <HI>Siam,</HI> one fir&s;t when they come, and the other of Leave when they depart.

In|deed, eight or ten days after the Audience of Entry, the Amba&s;&s;ador had another; it was private, and the Gentlemen was not admitted to it. The Amba&s;&s;ador took none with him but the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis,</HI> the Abbot <HI>de Choi&s;i</HI> and the Abbot <HI>de Lyonne,</HI> the re&s;t &s;tayed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King treats the Am|ba&s;&s;ador in his Palace mag|nificently.</NOTE>The Audience being ended they &s;ate down to Table, and continued at it almo&s;t four hours.

<P>About that time they began to examine the conduct of the two <HI>Mandarins</HI> whom the <HI>Barcalon</HI> &s;ent to <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vachet.</HI> The com|plaints that were made of them had reached the Kings Ears, who was offended at their proceed|ings.

<P>Seeing there are no Coaches at <HI>Siam,</HI> he was carried in a very neat Chair which he brought with him from <HI>France.</HI> The Bi&s;hop took one like to tho&s;e which the Superiors of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> u&s;e; the Abbot <HI>de Choi&s;i</HI> was carried in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and the Gentlemen went on Hor&s;eback, the <HI>Barcalons</HI> Lodgings were above a large quarter of a League from the Amba&s;&s;adors Palace, tho there be but three Streets betwixt them, but they are extream|ly long, all paved with Brick and bordered on each &s;ide with low hou&s;es, behind which there are trees that ca&s;t a &s;hade into the Streets, and which make plea&s;ant walks when the heat is over.

Having cro&s;&s;ed over eight or nine Courts, we came at length to the Riche&s;t and mo&s;t Cele|brated Pagod of the Kingdom, it is covered with <HI>Calin,</HI> which is a kind of a very white Metal be|twixt Tinn and Lead, with three Roofs one over another. At the door of it, there is on the one hand a Cow, and on the other a mo&s;t hideous Mon&s;ter. This Pagod is pretty long, but very narrow, and when one is within it, there is nothing to be &s;een but Gold. The Pillars, Walls, Ciel|ing and all the Figures are &s;o well gilt, that all &s;eem to be covered with plates of Gold. The building is pretty like to our Churches, and &s;up|ported by thick Pillars. Advancing forwards within it you find a kind of Altar upon which there are three or four Figures of beaten Gold near about the heighth of a Man; &s;ome of them &s;tand, and others are &s;itting cro&s;s-legged after the manner of the <HI>Siame&s;e.</HI> Beyond that there is a kind of Quire, where they keep the riche&s;t and mo&s;t precious Pagod or Idol of the Kingdom, for that is a name given indifferently to the Temple, or the Idol that is within it.

<P>About an hundred paces South of the Palace there is a great Park walled in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;cription of one of the faire&s;t Tem|ples of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> in the middle where|of &s;tands a va&s;t and high Fabric built cro&s;s-ways in the manner of our Churches, having over it five &s;olid gilt domes of Stone or Brick, and of extraordinary Architecture, the dome in the mid|dle is far bigger than the re&s;t, which are on the extremities and at the ends of the Cro&s;s. This Building re&s;ts upon &s;everal Ba&s;es or Pedi&s;tals, which are rai&s;ed one over another, tapering and grow|ing narrower towards the top. The way up to it on the four &s;ides is only by narrow and &s;teep Stairs of betwixt thirty and forty &s;teps three hands broad apiece and all covered with gilt <HI>Calin</HI> or <HI>Tin</HI> like the Roof. The bottom of the great
<PB N="182" REF="116"> Stair-ca&s;e is adorned on both &s;ides with above twenty Statues bigger than the Life, &s;ome where|of are of Bra&s;s, and the re&s;t of <HI>Calin</HI> and all gilt, but repre&s;enting but &s;orrily the Per&s;ons and Ani|mals for whom they have been made. This great Pile of Building is encompa&s;&s;ed with forty four great Piramides of different form and well wrought, ranked orderly upon different Plat-forms. On the lowe&s;t Plat-form &s;tand the four greate&s;t at the four corners of it upon large ba&s;es. The&s;e Piramides end at the top in a long very &s;lender Cone, extreamly well gilt, and &s;upporting a Nee|dle or Arrow of Iron, that pierces through &s;eve|ral Chri&s;tal balls of an unequal bigne&s;s. The body of tho&s;e great Piramides as well as of the re&s;t, is of a kind of Architecture that comes pretty near ours; but it has too much Sculpture upon it, and want|ing both the &s;implicity and proportions of ours, it comes &s;hort of its beauty, at lea&s;t in the eyes of tho&s;e that are not accu&s;tomed to it. If we have time we may give a more perfect Idea of that Architecture upon the &s;econd Plat-form, which is a little above the fir&s;t, there are &s;ix and thirty other Piramides &s;ome what le&s;s than the former: making a &s;quare round the Pagod, nine on each &s;ide. They are of two different Figures, &s;ome taper into a point as the former did, and the re&s;t are made round like a Bell on the top, after the manner of the domes which crown the Building; they are &s;o mingled that there are not two together of the &s;ame form. Over the&s;e in the third Plat-form, are other four Piramides on the four corners of it, which terminate in a point. They are le&s;s indeed than the fir&s;t, but bigger than the &s;econd. All the Fabrick and Piramides are inclo&s;ed in a kind
<PB N="183" REF="116"> of &s;quare Cloy&s;ter, above &s;ix&s;core common paces in length, about an hundred in breadth, and fif|teen foot high. All the Galleries of the Cloy&s;ter are open towards, the Pagod; the Cieling thereof is not ugly; for it is all painted and gilt after the Moresko way. Within the Galleries along the out Wall which is all clo&s;e ranges along Pe|de&s;tal brea&s;t high, on which &s;tand above four hun|dred Statues, rarely well gilt, and placed in mo&s;t ex|cellent order. Though they be only of Brick gilt, yet they appear to be very well &s;haped, but they are &s;o like one another, that if they were not unequal in bigne&s;s, one would think that they had been all ca&s;t in the &s;ame Mould. Among&s;t the&s;e Fi|gures we reckoned twelve of a Gigantick Stature, one in the middle of each Gallery, and two at each Angle. The&s;e Figures, becau&s;e of their height are &s;itting upon flat ba&s;es cro&s;s-leg'd, after the manner of the Country and of all the Orientals. We had the curio&s;ity to mea&s;ure one of their legs, which from the Toes to the Knee, was full &s;ix foot long, the Thumb of it was as big as an or|dinary Arm, and the re&s;t of the Body proportiona|bly big and tall. Be&s;ides the&s;e which are of the fir&s;t magnitude, there are about an hundred o|thers that are as it were Demi-Giants, having the Leg from the extremity of the Foot to the Knee four foot long. In &s;hort between the fir&s;t and &s;econd, we reckoned above three hundred, of which none are le&s;s than the life, and the&s;e &s;tand upright. I mention not a great many other little Pagods no bigger than Puppets, which are mingled among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We never &s;aw a Fabrick no not in <HI>France,</HI> where Symmetry is better ob&s;erved, either for the bo|dy
<PB N="184" REF="117"> of the Building, or the Ornaments about it, than in this Pagod. The Cloi&s;ter of it is flancked on the out&s;ide on each hand with &s;ixteen great &s;olid Piramids, rounded at the top in form of a Dome, above fourty foot high, and above twelve foot &s;quare, placed in a Line like a row of great Pillars, in the middle whereof there are larger niches filled with gilt Pagods. We were &s;o long taken up with the &s;ight of the&s;e things that we had not time to con&s;ider &s;everal other Temples clo&s;e by the Po&s;t within the &s;ame compa&s;s of Walls.

<P>Some days after we were arrived at <HI>Siam,</HI> there were two &s;olemn Services performed in the Church which we have in the field of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> the one for the late Queen of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the other for the late King <HI>Don Alphon&s;o.</HI> Father <HI>Suarez</HI> a Dominican Frier made the Funeral Sermons. After that the Fe&s;tivals of the Coronation of <HI>Don Pedro</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who reigns at pre&s;ent, was celebrated in the Church of the Dominicans, where one of their Fathers Preached. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> was at the charges of the Ob&s;equies and Fe&s;tivals. He would al&s;o have had a &s;olemn Service performed for the late King of <HI>England,</HI> if he had had certain intelligence that he died a Catho|lic. He only expre&s;&s;ed his Joy at the Coronation of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> by Illuminations and Fire|works, which for their Novelties plea&s;ed the <HI>French</HI> very much. There were long Horns out of which were &s;treams of Fire that &s;pouted up to a height like Water-works, and la&s;ted a long while,
<PB N="185" REF="117"> the&s;e Fe&s;tivals were accompanied with great Fea&s;t|ing, to which the chief of all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> to wit, the <HI>French, Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were invited.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoycings performed at <HI>Siam</HI> for the Coronation of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador could not excu&s;e him&s;elf from being pre&s;ent at two Fea&s;ts, which were made for the Coronation of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> We were obliged to be there too, the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> having come and taken us with him in his own <HI>Balon.</HI> The healths of all the Kings and Royal Families were drank there, with the noi&s;e of many great Guns.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Rejoycings came &s;everal Diverti&s;e|ments; the fir&s;t was a kind of a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Comedy, divided into Acts, various bold and antick po|&s;tures, and &s;ome pretty &s;urpri&s;ing feats of Agili|ty of Body &s;erved for Interludes. Unle&s;s on the one &s;ide the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> were acting their Comedy, the <HI>Laos</HI> who are a people than border on that Kingdom to the North, gave the Amba&s;&s;ador on the other &s;ide the diver&s;ion of an <HI>Indian</HI> Puppet-&s;how, which differ not much from ours. Betwixt the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Laos</HI> there was a Troop of <HI>Sia|me&s;e</HI> Men and Women, ca&s;t into a Ring, who danced after a pretty odd manner, that's to &s;ay, with their hands a&s;well as feet, making as many Figures with the one as they did with the other. The voices of &s;ome Men and Women, who &s;ung a little in the No&s;e, joyned to the noi&s;e they made with their Hands, regulated all the cadence.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Plays Tumblers appeared, who mounted to the top of high <HI>Bambous</HI> planted on the one end like Ma&s;ts. and about four&s;core or an hundred foot high; they &s;tood on the top of them on one foot, and holding the other in the Air,
<PB N="186" REF="118"> then placing their Head where their Foot had &s;tood, they rai&s;ed their Feet upright, &s;tanding upon their Head.

Another placed upon a kind of Litter or portable Couch &s;even or eight Daggers with the points up|wards, &s;ate down, and then lay along upon them, without hurting his Body which was &s;tark naked; he afterwards made a very heavy Man &s;tand upright upon his Belly, and none of the points which touched his naked Skin pierced him. The&s;e diver&s;ions were followed by &s;everal Con&s;orts that were performed by Mu&s;icians of divers Na|tions. There was nothing extraordinary, neither in the Mu&s;ick nor Voices; yet the novelty and di|ver&s;ity of them, made them plea&s;ant enough not to prove tedious the fir&s;t time. The <HI>Siame&s;e, Malayes, Pegus</HI> and <HI>Laos,</HI> gave a tryal of their harmony by turns, &s;triving to &s;urpa&s;s one another. Their In&s;truments much re&s;emble ours, but are very imper|fect: there was one that &s;eemed extraordinary to us, it was mounted with a dozen of little Bells hanging by it, which being gently &s;truck upon with little &s;ticks, rendred a mo&s;t harmonious &s;ound. In fine the Scene concluded with another <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Comedy, which began a little to cloy the Specta|tors, who were already weary. We were fain to be pre&s;ent at all the&s;e Shows.

It was plea&s;ant to &s;ee with what rapidity the&s;e <HI>Ba|lons</HI> every way proper for cleaving the Water, mounted up the River in emulation one of another, and none of the Rowers in the &s;pace of three Leagues took &s;o much as one Minutes re&s;t. They &s;houted either for joy or grief, according as they gained or lo&s;t the advantage. All the City and People about came running to &s;ee this Show. They drew up in their <HI>Balons</HI> by the &s;hoar, as in two Lines which reached three Leagues off of the City; &s;o that having &s;een and con&s;idered that confluence of people that went down and came up the River, we judged that there could not be le&s;s than about twenty thou&s;and <HI>Balons,</HI> and above two hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls; the other <HI>French</HI> reckoned a great many more, and confi|dently averred that there were above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls of them. When the King pa&s;t by upon the River all the windows and doors of the Hou&s;es were &s;hut, and the Port holes of the Ships too. All commanded to go out, that &s;o no body might be in a higer place than the King.</P>

<P>About two Leagues from the Town upon a va&s;t Plain covered with Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral of a great <HI>Talapoin.</HI></NOTE> and reaching out of &s;ight, we met with a new Spectacle; and that was the Ob&s;equies of a famous <HI>Talapoin,</HI> chief of the Religion of the <HI>Peguins.</HI> His Body was laid in a Coffin of Aromatic Wood. The Coffin was mounted upon a Funeral Pile, round which were four great Pillars of gilt Wood, which carried an high Pyramid of &s;everal Stories. This kind of burning Chappel was accompanied with &s;everal little pretty high and &s;quare Towers made of Wood, and covered with Pa&s;tboard very rude|ly painted, with a great many Paper Figures. All this was &s;urrounded with an Enclo&s;ure built &s;quare, upon which &s;everal other Towers were placed at competent di&s;tances. Four of them were as high as the Pyramid in the middle, and &s;tood in the four Corners; and on each &s;ide of
<PB N="192" REF="122"> that great Square there were two other Towers le&s;s than the former. They were all full of Fire|works, and we &s;aw many flying Fuzes come out of them. The four great Towers placed at the four Corners of the great Square, were joyned together by little Wooden Hou&s;es, painted with &s;everal antic Figures of Dragons, Apes, Devils with horns on their heads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Betwixt the&s;e Hovels there were at competent di&s;tances certain Openings contrived in form of a Portal to let <HI>Balons</HI> in and out. The <HI>Telapoins</HI> of <HI>Pegu,</HI> to a va&s;t number, in their <HI>Balons,</HI> took up almo&s;t the whole &s;pace that was betwixt the Funeral Pile and the great &s;quare Enclo&s;ure. They all looked with a grave and mode&s;t Countenance, now and then &s;inging, and &s;ometimes keeping profound Silence. An infinite number of People, Men and Women indifferently came after them, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted at this Funeral Pomp.</P>
<P>So new and unexpected a Scene made my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador &s;top for &s;ome time, and us with him, that we might view the Ceremonies of that &s;tately Funeral. However, we &s;aw no|thing but mimical Dances, and certain ridiculous Farces, acted by the <HI>Peguins</HI> and <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> under Sheds of <HI>Bambous</HI> that were open on all hands. They acted the po&s;tures of Men po&s;&s;e&s;t, with hi|deous Masks upon their Faces. Seeing this Fu|neral Pomp was to la&s;t till Night, and that we had four or five Leagues to go before we could come to the place of Lodging, we &s;aw only the beginning of it, and &s;ome Fire-Works. The Honours of this Nature given to the Dead a|mong&s;t the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> makes them &s;trongly addict|ed to their Religion. The <HI>Talapoins,</HI> who are ve|ry
<PB N="193" REF="123"> intere&s;ted Doctors, teach, that the more Ex|pence is made in the Ob&s;equies of a dead man, the more advantageou&s;ly his Soul is lodged in the Bo|dy of &s;ome Prince, or &s;ome other con&s;iderable A|nimal. In that Belief the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> many times undo them&s;elves by making magnificent Fune|rals.</P>
<P>We came in very good time to the Hou&s;e where we were to lie; it was in all things like to tho&s;e little Palaces which were erected for my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador upon the River. It may be &s;aid of this Countrey, that there cannot be a more plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect than it affords. When we were upon the Canal cut through the Fields to &s;horten the Way from <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Louvo,</HI> we &s;aw Plains reaching out of &s;ight full of Rice, and when we entred into the River, the green Trees and Villages wherewith it was bordered, refre&s;hed our &s;ight with an agreeable variety.</P>
<P>Before we left that place, the Amba&s;&s;ador had a mind to &s;ee one of the King's Palaces that was hard by. We only &s;aw the out&s;ide of it, be|cau&s;e the Hou&s;e-keeper had Orders to &s;uffer none to enter it. It &s;eems to be a very little and nar|row Palace, encompa&s;&s;ed on the out&s;ide with a little low Gallery in form of a Cloy&s;ter, but ve|ry irregular in its Architecture, the Pede&s;tals be|ing full as high as the Pila&s;ters. Round that Gallery runs a low Balcony encompa&s;&s;ed with Rails and Bali&s;ters of Stone Brea&s;t-high.</P>
<P>About an hundred paces from that Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;crip|tion of a Pa|lace of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> built after the <HI>European</HI> manner.</NOTE> we &s;aw another much bigger, and far more regu|lar. On the out&s;ide there are great Pila&s;ters at an equal di&s;tance from one another, which &s;avour very much of Art: It &s;tands in a great Square a|bove
<PB N="194" REF="124"> an hundred and fifty or &s;ixty paces in length. On the four &s;ides there are four very high Piles of Buildings in form of Galleries, and covered with a double Roof made round above like an Arch. The&s;e Galleries on the out&s;ide are adorned with mo&s;t lovely Pila&s;ters, having their Ba&s;es and Capitols proportioned much after the manner of ours; &s;o that the Architector who built that old Palace, abandoned at pre&s;ent, tho' it be almo&s;t entire, and incomparably finer than the new one, mu&s;t have had great skill in the Architecture of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o regular is that Fabrick. The&s;e Galleries are only open at the doors that are in the middle of each Front; and over the&s;e there are Buildings on all hands higher than the fir&s;t, and in the middle of all a great Body of Lodgings overlooking all the re&s;t, which with them makes a Fabrick of mo&s;t excellent Symme|try. It is the only regular and well proportioned Building that we found in that Countrey.</P>
<P>Having &s;een that Palace, we went &s;treight to <HI>Louvo,</HI> where the Palace which was ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and built at the King's Charges, for the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> was prepared for my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador. This Mini&s;ter came and received him there, and told him, ca&s;ting a mo&s;t obliging Eye upon us, that having been informed of the Goodne&s;s he had for his Brethren, he made no doubt but that he would willingly take up his Quarters in a Hou&s;e which belonged to them. After Supper we were conducted into a little Apartment of Mats and Bambous made purpo&s;ely for us, hung with painted Cloth, and furni&s;hed with very neat Sum|mer-Beds. But the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> perceiving that our In&s;truments and Baggage would not be &s;towed in
<PB N="195" REF="124"> that place with us, ordered large Lodgings be|longing to the King, to be furni&s;hed for us, that we might have more room there, whil&s;t he could accommodate us more conveniently.</P>
<P>Within a few days after our Arrival at <HI>Louvo</HI> the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> conducted my Lord Amba&s;|&s;ador to an Audience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives the Am|ba&s;&s;ador an Audience at <HI>Louvo.</HI></NOTE> We all waited on him to the Palace, it being the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI>'s de&s;ire that we &s;hould do &s;o; becau&s;e the King had a mind to &s;ee us privately, and would have us make the Ob&s;ervation of the Eclip&s;e of the Moon which was to be within three Weeks, in his Pre&s;ence. The Bi&s;hop and Abbot of <HI>Lyonne</HI> followed the Amba&s;&s;ador to the Hall of Audi|ence.</P>
<P>In the mean time we con&s;idered the Garden and out&s;ide of the Palace. It has a mo&s;t excellent Situation, being &s;eated by the River &s;ide upon a &s;mooth and even Eminence, and is of a large Compa&s;s. We &s;aw nothing remarkable but two great &s;eparated Piles of Building, and the Roofs all &s;hining with Gold. In this they are &s;ingular, that they are covered with yellow varni&s;hed Tiles, which glitter like Gold when the Sun &s;hines upon them; we were told that every one of the&s;e Tiles co&s;t about ten groats. Without the Pa|lace we &s;aw a Lion pre&s;ented by the <HI>French</HI> Com|pany to the King: It &s;eemed to be bigger, hand|&s;omer and &s;tronger than tho&s;e at <HI>Vincennes,</HI> but his Hair is not altogether &s;o yellow.</P>
<P>The Audience la&s;ted almo&s;t two hours. Whil&s;t they di&s;cour&s;ed of &s;everal things, the King took occa&s;ion to tell the Amba&s;&s;ador, that he was in|formed &s;ix Je&s;uits were come with him; that they were the <HI>French</HI> Kings Mathematicians, whom
<PB N="196" REF="125"> his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to make Ob&s;ervations in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> and to labour in the perfection of Arts; and that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee tho&s;e Learned Men. The Amba&s;&s;ador let not &s;lip the occa&s;ion of do|ing us that good Office, and &s;poke many things in our Favours. The King was not then &s;o high above the Amba&s;&s;ador as he was at the firlt Au|dience. He wore upon his Head a white painted Cap, encompa&s;&s;ed below with a Circle of Dia|monds. He was cloathed in a &s;trait Coat purled with Gold, having over it a large Ve&s;t of a ve|ry fine and tran&s;parent Stuff. He had &s;ome large Diamonds on his Fingers, but they were ill cut and ill &s;et. As he has more wit than your Ori|ental Princes commonly have, he &s;aid many things very wittily to the Glory of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and obligingly for the Amba&s;&s;ador. He added, that he prayed the God of Heaven to give him a more &s;peedy and &s;ucce&s;sful Voyage homeward than he had in coming abroad.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> invited a|broad the Amba&s;&s;ador with all his Attendants, to take the Air, all &s;everally mounted upon Ele|phants, They that ride them &s;it on the middle of their Back in a kind of a very wide Chair en|vironed with &s;mall gilt Rails, but without a Back, whil&s;t two Officers that &s;erve the Elephant, one upon his Neck, and another on his Rump, go|vern him with a great Iron Hook, as may be &s;een by the Figure. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Bea&s;ts have their Dome&s;tic Servants as Per&s;ons of Quality have: The lea&s;t have fifteen men that wait upon them quarterly, and others have twen|ty, twenty five, thirty and forty, according to their Rank; but the white Elephant has an hun|dred.
<PB N="197" REF="125"> The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> told me that the King hath at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and in his whole King|dom, not to reckon the wild that are among the Woods and Mountains. Sometimes they'l take fifty, &s;ixty, nay eighty of them at one &s;ingle bout of Hunting.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Academy Royal of Sciences recommended it to us to examine whe|ther or not all Elephants had Claws in their feet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ele|phants have five Toes in each Foot.</NOTE> we &s;aw not &s;o much as one but that had five on each foot, at the end of five great Toes; but their Toes are &s;o &s;hort, that they hardly peep out of the fle&s;hy Lump. We ob&s;erved that their Ears are nothing near &s;o big as they are commonly painted, and are le&s;s by a half than they are made to be in the Cut that was given us of one. Some we have &s;een who had Teeth of extraordinary Beauty and Length; they reach above four foot out of the mouth of &s;ome of them, and at certain di&s;tances are adorned with Rings of Gold, Silver and Copper.

<P>The truth is, we have learnt from &s;everal places, and very lately too at <HI>Siam</HI> from a <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary who had been at St. <HI>Thomas</HI> two Months before, that the&s;e Fathers had li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;everal years a|mong&s;t tho&s;e People, and applied them&s;elves with care and pains to their Conver&s;ion without any con&s;iderable fruit.

<P>Having &s;o taken the Badge of the <HI>Bramens,</HI> they began to live as they did; and &s;ince that time the&s;e Apo&s;tolic Men have been &s;een walking
<PB N="205" REF="129"> upon the burning hot Sand bare-footed and bare-headed, and continually expo&s;ed to the heat of the Sun, which is extraordinary there, becau&s;e the <HI>Bramens</HI> wear no Stockings nor Shoes, and never cover their Head; living on nothing but Herbs, and &s;pending three or four days without eating, under a Tree, or on the high way, wait|ing till &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> affected with &s;uch &s;urprizing au&s;terity, &s;hould come and hear them.

<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO SIAM. The Fifth BOOK.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of our Return from <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen it was re&s;olved upon, that I &s;hould return to <HI>France,</HI> the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> redoubled the Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip, wherewith he had till then honour'd me, telling me that he wi&s;hed he might frequently di&s;cour&s;e me in private. Next day I went to &s;ee him, accord|ing as he had enjoyned me at parting. I found him taken up in preparing Pre&s;ents for tho&s;e who had had the greate&s;t hand in the Favour which the King had done us of &s;ending us to <HI>China;</HI> and making us draw near to &s;ee them, the&s;e are
<PB N="208" REF="131"> but very mean Pre&s;ents, &s;aid he, for &s;o great Lords. But you &s;hall tell them, Father, that I came to know of it but very late, and after I had given away all the fine&s;t and mo&s;t curious things I had. For be&s;ides the Pre&s;ents which he &s;ent to <HI>France,</HI> and that he had given to the <HI>French</HI> who were at <HI>Siam,</HI> he had &s;ent &s;ome very con&s;iderable to <HI>Portugal,</HI> by the three Amba&s;&s;adors whom the King of <HI>Siam</HI> had di&s;patched to <HI>Lisbone,</HI> &s;ome|time before we arrived there. Nor is it, &s;aid he, a Pre&s;ent that I would have them take as from me, but as from one of your Brothers, to thank them for the Goodne&s;s they have for you, and the Protection they honour you with. We could make no an&s;wer to &s;uch obliging Expre&s;&s;ions, but by our mo&s;t humble Thanks; but he would not hear us, interrupting and adjuring us not to &s;peak to him in that Strain, that being our Bro|ther, he was perwaded he did no more but his Duty.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that we had Audience, the King was to treat the Amba&s;&s;ador with a Fight of E|lephants, and his Maje&s;ty had already command|ed &s;ix to be made ready for us, that we might follow him to the Field of Battle, which was out of Town. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> gave us a <HI>Man|darin</HI> to be our Guide, and as we came out of the Palace we found &s;ix Elephants with their gilt Chairs, and very neat Cu&s;hions. Every one got up on the Back of his own in this manner. The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> (for &s;o they call the Man that &s;its on the Elephants Neck to govern him) made the Ele|phant kneel, who afterward lay half down on one &s;ide, &s;o that one could put his Foot upon one of his Fore-legs, which he thru&s;t out, and then up|on

<PB REF="132">
<PB N="209" REF="132"> his Belly; after that, the Bea&s;t ri&s;ing a little up again, gave one time to &s;it down conveniently in the Chair which he carried on his Back; one may al&s;o make u&s;e of a Ladder, as &s;ome do, to get upon the Elephants Back. It is for the Convenience of Strangers, who are not accu&s;tom|ed to Elephants, that they put Chairs on their Backs. The Natives of the Country, what&s;oe|ver their Quality be, unle&s;s it be the King, ride on the Neck and conduct them them&s;elves, ex|cept when they go to War, for then, be&s;ides two <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> who get up one upon the Neck, and the other on the Rump, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> armed with a Lance, or a kind of Javelin, &s;ets on the Ele|phants Back, as I my &s;elf have &s;een it at a Hunt|ing of Elephants, whether the <HI>Mandarins</HI> go armed as to a Battle. I ob&s;erved al&s;o that the King, who was in a kind of Throne, &s;tarted up upon his Legs when the wild Elephants would have forced their way through on his &s;ide, and got upon the Neck of his to &s;top them.</P>
<P>We followed the King then into a large Plain, about an hundred Paces from the Town. The King, mounted on an Elephant, had my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador on his Right-hand at fifteen or twen|ty &s;teps di&s;tance, the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> on his Left-hand, and all round a great many <HI>Mandarins</HI> pro&s;trate at the Feet of his Elephant out of re|&s;pect. We pre&s;ently heard &s;ome Trumpets which make a very har&s;h and inarticulate Sound; then the two Elephants which were to fight roared and made a mo&s;t horrid Noi&s;e: They were tied by the Hind-feet with great Ropes; held by &s;everal Men, that they might be drawn off, in ca&s;e the Shock proved too hard. They
<PB N="210" REF="133"> let them approach in &s;uch a manner, that their Teeth cro&s;&s;ed, and yet they could not hurt one another.

The King of <HI>Siam</HI> never gives that kind of Shable but to his Generals of Armies, when they are &s;etting out upon a Warlike Ex|pedition, He made &s;uch another Pre&s;ent to <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Joyeux</HI> Captain of the Frigat, but not &s;o Magnificent.</P>
<P>Some days after, the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> &s;ent rich Pre&s;ents to the Amba&s;&s;ador, the <HI>Abbot de Choi&s;i, Mon&s;ieur de Vaudricourt, Mon&s;ieur de Joyeux,</HI> and to every one of the Gentlemen of the Amba&s;&s;ador's Retinue. The&s;e were <HI>Japan</HI> Plate, wrought A|gats, a great many fine China-di&s;hes of all Sizes,
<PB N="211" REF="133"> China-Night Gowns, right Bezoar-Stones, the <HI>Gin&s;eng</HI> Root that is worth eight times its weight in Silver, the odoriferous Wood of <HI>Aquila,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teemed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and excellent Tea in great quantity. The&s;e Pre&s;ents &s;eemed to be of &s;o con&s;iderable a Value, that for &s;ome time it was thought by many that they had been &s;ent by the King.</P>
<P>We &s;pent mo&s;t of the days we &s;tayed at <HI>Lou|vo</HI> in Shows. The Fight we ju&s;t now mention|ed, was followed by another of Elephants again&s;t a Tygre; we were obliged to be there as well as the re&s;t, and mounted on Elephants. We made u&s;e of no other Bea&s;t to ride on, that we might not &s;candalize the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> who &s;ay that it is pro|hibited to them to ride on Hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a League from the Town, they had rai&s;ed a high Pali&s;&s;ado of <HI>Bambous,</HI> a|bout an hundred Paces &s;quare. Three Elephants appointed to fight the Tyger, were got into the middle of the Li&s;ts. They had a kind of large Brea&s;t-plate, which covered their Head and part of their Trunk. So &s;oon as we were come, out of a Lodge that was in a low place, they brought a Tyger, of a Shape and Colour which &s;eemed &s;trange to the <HI>French</HI> that were Spectators. For be&s;ides that, he was much taller, gro&s;&s;er, and more lumpi&s;h than tho&s;e that we had &s;een in <HI>France;</HI> his Skin was not &s;potted in that Fa&s;hion, but in|&s;tead of Spots &s;cattered here and there without order, it had long broad Streaks that encompa&s;&s;ed it like Rings. The&s;e Streaks beginning at the Back joyned under the Belly, and continuing to the End of the Tail, made thereupon white and black Rings, which were &s;et very thick, and co|vered
<PB N="212" REF="134"> it all over. The Head and Limbs of the Bea&s;t had nothing extraordinary, &s;ave that they were longer and bigger than tho&s;e of common Tygers, though this was but a young Tyger; and not yet come to his full Growth, for the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> told us that there were &s;ome in the Kingdom three times bigger than that, and that being a hunting one day with the King, he &s;aw one at a very near di&s;tance that was as big as a Mule. They have little ones in that Country al|&s;o, like tho&s;e they bring from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>Europe,</HI> and they &s;hew'd us one of them at <HI>Louvo</HI> the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>They did not let &s;lip the Tyger that was to fight at fir&s;t, but held him tied by two Ropes, &s;o that not having liberty to &s;hoot him&s;elf out, the fir&s;t Elephant that came near him, gave him two or three Blows with his Trunk on the Back. This Shock was &s;o rude that it laid the Tyger for &s;ome time all along upon the Ground, and without motion, as if he had been dead. Neverthele&s;s, &s;o &s;oon as he was untied, though the fir&s;t bout had quelled much of his Fury, he made a terrible Cry, and would have thrown him&s;elf upon the Ele|phants Trunk, but the Elephant turning it cun|ningly inwards, &s;ecured it by his Teeth, which he pre&s;ently pre&s;ented to the Tyger, and there|with &s;truck him &s;o pat, that he to&s;&s;ed him up to a great height, in the Air. This &s;o &s;tun'd the Bea&s;t, that he dur&s;t no more approach the Ele|phant, but taking &s;everal turns about the Yard, he &s;ometimes &s;prung at tho&s;e whom he &s;aw in the Galleries. Then three Elephants were let loo&s;e again&s;t him, who mauled him &s;o by turns, that once more he counterfeited to be dead, and after|ward
<PB N="213" REF="134"> made all the &s;hifts he could to avoid them. They would certainly have killed him, had not the Amba&s;&s;ador begg'd his Pardon of the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> who put an end to the Combat.</P>
<P>Next Day towards the Evening, we went to the Palace with my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador; there we &s;aw an Illumination, which is yearly made at the beginning of the Year: It con&s;i&s;ted of eighteen hundred or two thou&s;and Lights, &s;ome whereof were placed in little Windows purpo&s;ely made in the Walls that environ the Palace, and the re&s;t in Lanthors, in a pretty &s;ingular Order. Above all we admired &s;ome certain large China-Lanthorns like to Globes, which are made of one &s;ingle piece of tran&s;parent Horn as clear as Gla&s;s, and &s;ome others of a kind of China-gla&s;s made of Rice. The&s;e Illuminations were accompanied with the Noi&s;e of Drums, Fifes and Trumpets. All the while that the King was pre&s;ent at this Show, the Prince&s;s gave the like to the Court Ladies in another part of the Palace.</P>
<P>When the King was gone, we had time to con&s;ider all things at a near di&s;tance. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> &s;how'd us the Elephant Prince, who is of an extraordinary Height and Beauty; we were told that they called him by that Name, becau&s;e he came into the World the &s;ame day that the pre&s;ent King was born. He made us al&s;o ob&s;erve near to the Kings Apartment, a Pavilion where they keep the Elephant that is upon Guard, it is one of tho&s;e that are in the Palace, and are re|lieved by turns, being always kept in a readine&s;s, if the King &s;hould chance to want them by Day or by Night. Having often mentioned Ele|phants, and the different manner, they are har|na&s;&s;ed
<PB N="214" REF="135"> according to the Qualities of tho&s;e that mount them, it hath been thought fit to give the Reader the following Cuts of the &s;everal &s;orts of them. The&s;e Illuminations la&s;ted &s;everal days; all the while we were in the Palace to ob&s;erve them, a great many <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Order, lay pro&s;trate upon the Ground be|fore the King in two different Halls, making to him the <HI>Zombaye,</HI> which is the mo&s;t reverential Mark of Adoration.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time the Moors made great Illuminations for eight days together, in Honour of their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Son, who&s;e Funerals they celebrated. They began to &s;olemnize the Fe&s;tival the Evening before about four of the Clock at Night, by a kind of Proce&s;|&s;ion, wherein there were above two thou&s;and Souls. There they carried the Figure of the Tombs of tho&s;e two Impo&s;tors, with many Sym|bols of a pretty neat Repre&s;entation, among&s;t o|thers, certain great Cages covered with painted Cloth, and carried by Men that marched and continually turned in cadence to the Sound of Drums and Timbrels. The quick and regular Motion of the&s;e huge Machines which we &s;aw at a di&s;tance, without perceiving tho&s;e that carried them, occa&s;ioned an agreeable Surpri&s;e.</P>
<P>At the Head of this great Confluence of Peo|ple, &s;ome Grooms led three or four Hor&s;es in rich Trappings, and a great many People carry|ing &s;everal Lanthorns at the end of long Poles, lighted all the Proce&s;&s;ion and &s;ung in divers Quires after a very odd manner. With the &s;ame Zeal they continued this Fe&s;tival for &s;everal Nights together till five of the Clock in the Morn|ing.
<PB N="215" REF="135"> It is hardly to be conceived how the&s;e Porters of Machines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moors make a Fea&s;t to celebrate the Memory of their Pro|phet.</NOTE> that unce&s;&s;antly turned, could per|form that Exerci&s;e for fifteen or &s;ixteen Hours to|gether, nor how the Singers that rai&s;ed their Voi|ces as high as was po&s;&s;ible for them, could &s;ing &s;o long. The re&s;t of the Proce&s;&s;ion looked mo|de&s;t enough, &s;ome marched before the Singers, who &s;urrounded Coffins carried upon eight Mens Shoulders, and the re&s;t were mingled in the Croud with them. There were a great many <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Men and Women, Young and Old there, who have embraced the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. For &s;ince the Moors have got footing in the Kingdom, they have drawn over a great many People to their Religion, which is an Argument that they are not &s;o addicted to their Super&s;titions, but that they can for&s;ake them, when our Mi&s;&s;iona|ries have had Patience and Zeal enough to in|&s;truct them in our My&s;teries. It is true, that Nation is a great Lover of Shows and &s;plendid Ceremonies, and by that means it is that the Moors, who celebrate all their Fe&s;tivals with a great deal of Magnificence, have perverted many of them to the Sect of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Shows made us heartily condole the Mi&s;|fortune of tho&s;e poor Infidels, and we often di&s;|cour&s;ed of the Fruit that &s;o many able Men as are in <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly in <HI>France,</HI> might reap among&s;t them, if they had as much Zeal as Learning.</P>
<P>The King who took plea&s;ure to give the Am|ba&s;&s;ador new Diver&s;ions dayly, would have him to &s;ee the manner of taking and taming, Ele|phants. This being a thing unknown in <HI>Europe</HI> and we having been Witne&s;&s;es of it, the Render,
<PB N="216" REF="136"> I hope, will be glad to find here an example and exact de&s;cription of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of taking and taming Ele|phants.</NOTE>About a quarter of a League from <HI>Louvo</HI> there is a kind of an Amphitheater, of a large and long &s;quare Figure, encompa&s;&s;ed with high Walls and Terra&s;&s;es, where the Spectators are placed. Along the&s;e Walls within runs a Pali&s;adoe of thick Pillars fa&s;tened in the Ground at a foot di|&s;tance one from another, behind which the Hunt&s;|men retreat when they are pur&s;ued by the fret|ted Elephants. There is a very large opening made towards the Countrey, and oppo&s;ite to it, on the &s;ide of the Town one le&s;s, which leads into a narrow Alley through which an Elephant can hardly pa&s;s, and that Alley ends in a large <HI>manage,</HI> where they compleatly tame him at length.</P>
<P>When the day appointed for this Hunting is come. Hunt&s;men go into the Woods, mounted on She-Elephants which are trained to the Game; and cover them&s;elves with leaves of Trees that they may not be &s;een by the wild Elephants. When they are got pretty forward in the Fore&s;t, where they think &s;ome Elephant may be, they make the Female give &s;ome neys that are proper to attract the Males, who pre&s;etnly an&s;wer by dreadful roarings. Then the Hunt&s;men perceiving them at a va&s;t di&s;tance return back again, and gently lead the Females towards the Amphithea|ter we mentioned: the wild Elephants never fail to follow them; he whom we &s;aw tamed entred with them, and &s;o &s;oon as he was there the Barr was &s;hut; the females kept on their way cro&s;s the Amphitheater, and at one anothers tails pa&s;t along the little Ally that was at the other end: The

So &s;oon as he was there they fa&s;tned an Elephant to each &s;ide of him, another went before and pulled him by a rope into the way that they would have him take, whil&s;t a fourth made him go forwards by thumping him with his head behind, until he came to a kind of <HI>manage</HI> where they tyed him to a great Pillar made for that purpo&s;e, which turns like the Cap|&s;tern of a Ship. They left him there till next day that he might &s;pend his anger; but whil&s;t he tormented him&s;elf about that Pillar, a <HI>Bramen</HI> (that is to &s;ay one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Prie&s;ts who are numerous in <HI>Siam</HI>) cloathed in white and mount|ed on another Elephant drew nigh, and turning gently about this which was tied, &s;prinkled him with a certain water con&s;ecrated after their man|ner, which he carried in a Ve&s;&s;el of Gold. They believe that that Ceremony makes the Elephant loo&s;e his natural fiercene&s;s, and fits him for to &s;erve the King. The day following he begins to go with the re&s;t, and in a fortnights time is fully tamed.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all tho&s;e diver&s;ions the Amba&s;&s;ador was wholly taken up about the Subject of his Emba&s;&s;ie, which was the Conver&s;ion of the King; but per|ceiving that he had no &s;olid nor po&s;itive an&s;wer as to that, he re&s;olved to draw up a &s;hort me|moir, which he intended &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the King by the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance.</HI> He &s;poke of it to that Mini&s;ter, who in a long conference they had together di&s;&s;waded him from pre&s;&s;ing the King upon that point; but the Amba&s;&s;ador very prudently &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his opinion, and prayed the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> to pre&s;ent that writing to his

He knew very well that your Maje&s;ty is dreaded by all your Neighbours, and in a condition to puni&s;h them if they &s;hould offer to break the Peace which by their prayers they have obtained from you.

<P>That Prince, Sir, is more admirable &s;till by his Wi&s;dom, Judgment, and Prudence, than by his Con|que&s;ts and Victories.

<P>This was the an&s;wer of the King of <HI>Siam</HI> in the &s;ame terms that he delivered it to his Mini|&s;ter, and as he gave it in writing to my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador. The wit of that Prince &s;ufficiently appears by that rea&s;oning who without any know|ledge of the Sciences of <HI>Europe,</HI> hath alledged with &s;o much force and per&s;picuity the mo&s;t plau|&s;ible rea&s;ons of the Pagan Philo&s;ophy again&s;t the only true Religion. They who know the up|rightne&s;s of that Prince cannot doubt but that he &s;incerely &s;aid what he thought, and what &s;eemed to him mo&s;t rational.</P>
<P>The King having &s;aid &s;o, was &s;ilent for &s;ome time, and then eyeing the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> his Reply to the King of <HI>Siam's</HI> Objections a|bout changing of Religion.</NOTE> <HI>What do you think</HI> (added he) <HI>the Amba&s;&s;ador will an|&s;wer to the&s;e Rea&s;ons which I command you to give him in writing?</HI> I &s;hall not fail Sir, an&s;wered the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> to obey your Maje&s;ties Orders; but I cannot tell what the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> will an&s;wer to what you have now &s;aid to me, which &s;eems to be of very great weight and con|&s;equence. Sure I am, he mu&s;t needs be &s;urpri|&s;ed at the high wi&s;dom and wonderful per&s;picuity that he'll perceive thereby in your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>However I fancy he may an&s;wer, that it is true all the Beings which God hath Created Glorifie him every one after its way; but that there is this difference betwixt Man and Bea&s;ts, that when God Created the&s;e, be gave them different properties and particular in&s;tincts, to know what is good for them and pur|&s;ue it without any reflection, to di&s;cern their evil, and avoid it without any ratiocination. So the Stag flies from the Lion, and Tyger the fir&s;t time
<PB N="226" REF="141"> he &s;ees them, the Chickens new hatched dread the Kite and flie under the wings of the Hen, without any other in&s;truction but what they have received from Nature. But in the Creation of Man God hath endowed him with a Mind and Rea&s;on to di&s;tingui&s;h the Good from the Evil, and Divine Providence hath thought it fit that in pur&s;uing and loving the good which is proper for him, and avoiding the evil that is contrary to him, with reference to his ultimate end which is to know and love God, Man &s;hould from the Divine Bounty merit an eternal Reward.</P>
<P>The truth is, it is as ea&s;ie for Man to make u&s;e of his hands, eyes, and feet, in the commi&s;&s;ion of evil as in doing of good, if his prudence enlightned by the Wi&s;dom of God directed him not to pur&s;ue the ways of real Grandeur, which are not to be found but in the Chri&s;tian Religion, wherein Man finds the means of &s;erving God as be&s;t plea&s;es his Divine Goodne&s;s. But all Men follow not &s;o holy and &s;o rational notices. It is ju&s;t &s;o as with your Maje&s;ties Officers, who are not all equally addicted to your Intere&s;ts, as you but too well know, tho all of them call them&s;elves your Subjects, and account it an honour to be employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">in your Service. So all Men &s;erve God, it is true; but in a very different manner. Some like Bea&s;ts follow their Pa&s;&s;ions and irregu|lar appetites and live in the Religion they have been brought up in, without examining it. But others perceiving &s;o great a difference betwixt them&s;elves and Bea&s;ts rai&s;e them&s;elves above their &s;en&s;es, and by means of their Rea&s;on, which God fails not to enlighten endeavour to know their Creator, and the true Wor&s;hip which he
<PB N="227" REF="141"> would have men render unto him, without any intere&s;t but that of plea&s;ing him, and to this &s;incere &s;earch of the truth, God Almighty hath annexed Mans Salvation. Hence it is that neg|ligence in not being in&s;tructed, and weakne&s;s in not following that we judge the be&s;t, will ren|der us guilty in the &s;ight of God who is the So|vereign Judge of all Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer from a Man of no Studies, who from ten years of age had been applied to Trade and Commerce, wrought a great &s;urprize in me, when he did me the honour to acquaint me with it. I confe&s;&s;ed to him, without any fear of flattery, that a Divine con&s;ummated in the Study of Religion, would have been hard put to it to have an&s;wered better. The King was &s;mitten with the di&s;cour&s;e of the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> and if any knowing Man, who is acceptable to him, hath the happine&s;s to in&s;inuate into his fa|vour, and procure his e&s;teem, it is not to be di&s;paired but that he may be brought to know and embrace the Truth: and if once he come to know it, &s;eeing he is the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of his People, who adore him, all the Nations who are under his Dominion, will humbly follow his ex|ample.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> who Reigns at pre&s;ent is about fifty five years of Age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Character of the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> He is without con|tradiction, the greate&s;t Prince that ever governed that State. He is &s;omewhat under the middle Stature, but &s;treight and well &s;haped. He hath an engaging Air, a &s;weet and obliging carriage, e&s;pecially to Strangers. And among&s;t them par|ticularly to the <HI>French.</HI> He is active and brisk, an enemy of idlene&s;s and lazine&s;s which &s;eems to be
<PB N="228" REF="142"> &s;o delightful to the Princes of the Ea&s;t, and which they look upon as the greate&s;t Prerogative of their Crown. This Prince, on the contrary, is always either in the Woods a hunting of Elephants, or in his Palace minding the Affairs of his Kingdom. He is no lover of War, becau&s;e it ruins his Peo|ple whom he tenderly loves; but when his Sub|jects revolt, or that neigbouring Princes offer him the lea&s;t affront, or tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of the re&s;pect that's due to him; there is no King in the Ea&s;t that takes a more con&s;picuous revenge, nor appears more pa&s;&s;ionate for glory.</P>
<P>Some great men of his Kingdom having rebel|led, and having been openly &s;upported by the Forces of three Kings, who&s;e Territories environ the Kingdom of <HI>Siam.</HI> He attacked tho&s;e Princes &s;o briskly, that they were obliged to abandon the Rebels to his wrath. He would know every thing, and having a pregnant and piercing Wit, he ea&s;ily is Ma&s;ter of what he has a mind to learn. He is magnificent, generous, and as true a friend as can be imagined. The&s;e are the great quali|ties which acquire him the difference of his Neigh|bours, the fear of his Enemies, the e&s;teem and re&s;pect of his Subjects that's nothing &s;hort of ado|ration. He hath never been given to tho&s;e vices which are &s;o common to the Princes of the Ea&s;t, nay he hath &s;everely puni&s;hed the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and principal Officers of the Crown, for being too much addicted to their plea&s;ures: So that the mo&s;t invincible ob&s;tacle to the Conver&s;ion of Idolatrous Princes, is not to be found in him, I mean, the immoderate love of Women.</P>
<PB N="229" REF="142">
<P>By the &s;harpne&s;s of his Wit, he hath di&s;covered the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of the Religion of his Ance&s;tors. And he does not believe an annihilated God, ac|cording to the Popular opinion, or as &s;ome of their Doctors &s;ay, a God, who weary of govern|ing the Heavens, plunges him&s;elf to repo&s;e, and for ever buries him&s;elf in the forgetfulne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es in the world, nor a thou&s;and other Super&s;titions preached by the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> who are the Preachers and Prie&s;ts of the Kingdom. On the contrary, he believes that God is Eternal, that his Providence continually governs the World and di&s;po&s;es of all things. To the &s;ame immortal God he often makes his Prayers, and implores his a&s;&s;i|&s;tance with mo&s;t profound Reverence at lea&s;t twice a Day, for two hours time, in the Morning after he is up, and at Night before he goes to re&s;t. The Pope having &s;ent him two Pictures, one of our Saviour, and the other of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, he hath a &s;ingular veneration for them, and as a &s;ign thereof, hath placed them in a very high place of his Chamber far above him; and never &s;peaks of them but with honour and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;y which the King &s;ent to him, if it hath not determined him to embrace Chri&s;tianity, hath at lea&s;t, made him reflect and con&s;ider. As he has an extraordinary e&s;teem for the wi&s;dom of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, &s;o when the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> explained to him the &s;ole rea&s;on that moved that great Monarch to &s;end the Amba&s;&s;ador to him, he &s;eemed affected therewith, and it is known that he hath many times reflected thereupon &s;ince. The&s;e are con&s;iderations that &s;hould excite tho&s;e who may read the&s;e momoires, to pray to God for the Conver&s;ion of that Prince, which would be attended
<PB N="230" REF="143"> with the Conver&s;ion of an innumerable multitude of People, and which without doubt would gain to our holy Law the neighbouring Princes, who admire the conduct and parts of the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>There lye great obligations upon us to that Monarch, for all the marks of e&s;teem and good will wherewith he was pleaa&s;ed to honour us, and we are glad we have the occa&s;ion of publi&s;h|ing the &s;ame; from the time that the Lord <HI>Con|&s;tance</HI> made him &s;en&s;ible of our ways and the pro|&s;pects that put us upon acting, that Prince favoured us upon all occa&s;ions, notwith&s;tanding the bad im|pre&s;&s;ions that &s;ome endeavoured to give him of Je|&s;uits.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI> demands the <HI>Chevalier de Fourbin</HI> from the Am|ba&s;&s;ador.</NOTE>The King upon his return from hunting, found the <HI>French</HI> drawn up in a Line at the entry into the Fore&s;t, and mounted on Elephants. He eye|ed them very much, and took plea&s;ure to &s;ee men of &s;o good meen. He had ju&s;t given, Audi|ence to the Amba&s;&s;ador, which had been pretty long. About the end of it, he &s;ent for the <HI>Che|valier de Fourbin,</HI> an old Officer, who had gained reputation on many occa&s;ions. The Lord <HI>Con|&s;tance</HI> had prayed the Amba&s;&s;ador to leave him at <HI>Siam</HI> with the King his Ma&s;ter. Nay his Maje|&s;ty him&s;elf thought fit to demand him of the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and made him a Pre&s;ent of a very love|ly Shable, as a Mark that he received him into his Service. He added to the Pre&s;ent be&s;ides, a Ve&s;t of a flowered Stuff, with Gold Buttons. In the mean time it was late, and the King was gone home; however we alighted in a plea&s;ant place, where a &s;plendid Collation of all &s;orts of Sweet-Meats and Fruit was prepared for us. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador drank the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Health in a large Cup of beaten Gold which he had pre|&s;ented to him. The Lid and Salver of it were of the &s;ame Metal.

<PB N="235" REF="147"> &s;ecure us from Tigers and other wild Bea&s;ts, that were enclo&s;ed within the Precincts.

<P>About Nine of the Clock we came to the &s;ide of the Canal, which leads to the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Je&s;uits prepare to ob&s;erve in the Kings pre|&s;ence at <HI>Thee-po&s;&s;onne.</HI></NOTE> and there we found one of the King's <HI>Balons,</HI> which had wait|ed for us a long while. This Canal is very broad, and above a League in length. It was lighted on both &s;ides with an infinite number of &s;uch Fires as were mentioned before, which all together in the ob&s;curity of the Night rendred a very charm|ing pro&s;pect. When we were got within half a quarter of a League of the Ca&s;tle, our Water|men, who till then had pulled hard and made much noi&s;e in rowing, began to row &s;o ea&s;ily, that we hardly heard the noi&s;e of their Oars. They told us, that we mu&s;t either hold our peace, or &s;peak very low. The truth is, when we landed, all was &s;o quiet, though there were a great many Soldiers and <HI>Mandarins</HI> thereabouts, that we thought we were in &s;ome remote Solitude. The Reve|rence they have for the King's Per&s;on, makes them ob&s;erve that profound &s;ilence in all places where he is. We pre&s;ently fitted &s;everal Tele&s;|copes upon &s;ome Props that had been rai&s;ed to &s;upport them. It did not require much time to adju&s;t our In&s;truments; &s;o that we took Boat again an hour after, and went to &s;pend part of the Night in the Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> which is almo&s;t an hundred paces from the Pa|lace.</P>
<PB N="236" REF="148">
<P>When we were to &s;tep a&s;hoar at the foot of the Wall which is on the other &s;ide of the Ca|nal, there was danger of being pricked by a kind of Caltrops; for there were a great many iron Chains laid in length at half a foot di&s;tance from one another, and the&s;e take up the breadth of the ground betwixt the Canal and the Wall. They are armed with a double Row of thick Iron Spikes; they are every night, without fail, &s;tretch|ed round the Ca&s;tle, and &s;erve to hinder any approaching to it. At our coming a&s;hoar, the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> gave us very timely notice to take heed to our &s;elves, having ob&s;erved that one of our Fathers was about to &s;tep on Land. He &s;ent for the Officer of the Guard, and ordered him to take up tho&s;e Caltrops, which hindred our coming a&s;hoar. Having then got as near the Walls as we could, we walked in a little path two foot broad, which is left free, for making the Rounds in the Night time, and about Eleven a Clock at Night we arrived at the Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They begin the Ob&s;erva|tion of the E|clip&s;e before the King.</NOTE>Having re&s;ted three or four hours there, we re-imbarked and went to the Gallery where the Ob&s;ervation was to be made.

What a Clock was it at <HI>Paris?</HI> For what could Ob&s;ervations made by concert in remote Coun|tries be u&s;eful? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whil&s;t we &s;atisfied all his Que&s;tions, one of the chief Officers of his Hou&s;e brought us upon a large Silver Ba&s;on &s;ix Ca&s;&s;ocks and as many Cloaks of flowred Sattin, where|with the King pre&s;ented us in a mo&s;t obliging manner. He had a mind to look in a Tele&s;cope twelve foot long, which Father <HI>Fontenay</HI> made u&s;e of; and we pre&s;ently carried it to him. He &s;uffered us to ri&s;e and &s;tand in his Pre&s;ence, and would look in the Tele&s;cope after us; for we mu&s;t needs &s;et it to its Point when we pre|&s;ented it to him. They who know what Reve|rence and Re&s;pect the Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> expect from tho&s;e who are in their Pre&s;ence, have &s;po|ken of that Favour to us, as of a very rare thing.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty would then know which of the Fathers was to return to <HI>France;</HI> and being told that it was I, he told me very obligingly, that &s;ee|ing he was &s;ending Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>France,</HI> who were not well acquainted with the Cu&s;toms and Manners of <HI>Europe,</HI> he tru&s;ted much to the good Coun&s;els that I &s;hould give them, and e&s;pecially the good Offices that I would render them by means of our Friends; that he had ordered them

At the &s;ame time the Lord High Cham|berlain, in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence pre&s;ented me with two lovely Crucifixes in a large Gold Ba|&s;on. The <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was of Ma&s;&s;e Gold, the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of <HI>Tambag,</HI> which is made of a mixture of &s;even parts of Gold, and three parts more of a Metal as precious as Gold it &s;elf, the Foot was of Silver. His Maie&s;ty told me, that the bigge&s;t was de|&s;igned for Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> the King's Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e Merit and Fidelity in the Service of his Ma&s;ter, he knew by the Character that the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> had given of him. Then he fell a prai&s;|ing the Zeal and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his own Mi|ni&s;ter, whom he always called our Brother; tel|ling us, that he had received mo&s;t &s;ignal Services from him on all occa&s;ions that ever pre&s;ented. After that his Maje&s;ty commanded me to tell the Father Confe&s;&s;or, when in his Name I pre&s;ented him that Crucifix, that he could not render him more acceptable Service, nor more u&s;eful to his State, than in obtaining for him twelve <HI>Mathe|maticians</HI> from the King; that I might a&s;&s;ure them, that before their Arrival, there would be an Ob&s;ervatory, a Hou&s;e and a Church for them at <HI>Louvo</HI> as well as at <HI>Siam.</HI> At the &s;ame time he enjoyned the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> to get them forth|with built, and with a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Fathers to chu&s;e Places for them in the two Towns I have been &s;peaking of. As for the other Crucifix, I
<PB N="240" REF="150"> freely give it you, &s;aid he, with a mo&s;t gracious Look, that it may &s;erve you for a faithful Com|panion during all your Voyage.

At length, having recommended to my Care what he then had enjoyned me, and what he was told by o|thers from him, he again wi&s;hed me a &s;peedy Return, and &s;o went away, expre&s;&s;ing the plea|&s;ure and &s;atisfaction that he had received during the two hours that he had done us the Honour to be pre&s;ent at our Ob&s;ervations. No body was near his Per&s;on all the while he was with us, but the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> the Lord Chamberlain, and a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber.

<P>By the Ob&s;ervations of the Lunar Eclip&s;e, <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 21. 1682. the Longitude of <HI>Siam</HI> was found to be of 121 degrees, which exactly a|grees with the&s;e new Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange thing that there &s;hould be mo|dern Maps that put the Longitude of <HI>Siam</HI> in the 145. degree, whereas the great Map of the Ob&s;ervatory made long before the&s;e Ob&s;ervati|ons, gives it 122 degrees, within a degree or little more of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>A <HI>Bramen</HI> A&s;trologer, who was at <HI>Louvo,</HI> had foretold this Eclip&s;e to a quarter of an hour al|mo&s;t; but he was mightily mi&s;taken as to the duration of it, &s;aying that the Emer&s;ion would not appear above the horizon till after the Sun was up. Some days before, we had a Confe|rence with that <HI>Bramen;</HI> but &s;ince we under&s;tood not the <HI>Siam</HI>-Language, we could not learn any thing of the manner how he calculates Eclip&s;es. He propo&s;ed to us &s;ome Que&s;tions about the Sun and Stars, which were ea&s;ily an&s;wered, as for in&s;tance, in what Sign the Sun was? how many fixed Stars we reckoned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He asked us, if what we had read in &s;ome <HI>China</HI>-Books, was true, that there always appeared a fixed and ve|ry &s;parkling Star perpendicularly over the Palace of the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> at <HI>Peguin?</HI> We told him it was a Fable; and it was no hard matter to make him of the &s;ame mind. He was not of the Opinion of the <HI>Siame&s;e Talapoins,</HI> who ima|gine
<PB N="243" REF="151"> and teach, that when the Moon is eclip&s;ed, a Dragon devours her, and ca&s;ts her up again. When it is objected to them, how it comes to pa&s;s then that we know and foretell the very moment of the Eclip&s;e, how great it will be, how long it is to la&s;t; how comes it to pa&s;s that &s;ometimes there is but part of the Moon eclip&s;ed, and &s;ome|times all of it? They dryly an&s;wer, that this Dragon has his Meals regulated, that we know the time of them, and the mea&s;ure likewi&s;e of his Appetite, which is &s;ometimes greater and &s;ome|times le&s;s. One had as good &s;ay nothing at all, as to offer to prove that tho&s;e all are Chimerical Notions; for they wilfully per&s;i&s;t in their illu&s;ion.

<P>I Cannot expre&s;s to your mo&s;t Reverend Paternity the Joy that I have felt this Year, and I hope you will not take it ill, if I give you a particular Account of the Grounds and Cau&s;es of it. The fir&s;t was the Arrival of His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Court, which hath furni&s;hed me the Occa&s;ion that I &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired of rendring to that Prince in the Per&s;on of His Amba&s;&s;ador all the Services I am capable of. The &s;econd was the great and pious Matters which that Amba&s;&s;ador came here to manage, and la&s;tly, the coming of &s;ix of my Brethren, whom the mo&s;t Chri&s;ti|an
<PB N="244" REF="152"> King hath &s;ent into the&s;e Parts on &s;o noble a De|&s;ign. The&s;e Enterprizes, worthy of &s;o great a Monarch, have ravi&s;hed into admiration all the Princes of the Ea&s;t, and have wrought in them an ardent de&s;ire of &s;olliciting the Friend&s;hip of &s;o wi&s;e and generous a King. But the King my Ma&s;ter hath been more af|fected with the&s;e things, than all the other Princes of the <HI>Indies</HI> be&s;ides. Though before any thing of the&s;e mutual Expre&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip, the King my Ma|&s;ter had conceived a high e&s;teem and particular Amity for his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, I dare a&s;&s;ure your Pa|ternity, that &s;ince the time I have had the honour to &s;erve him, he hath never &s;eemed better plea&s;ed than in hearing the Relations of the Conque&s;ts, Victories and other Grandeurs that always attend his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. I will not enlarge any more upon that, be|cau&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me or any el&s;e who has the honour to know the King, my Ma&s;ter, to expre&s;s how &s;en&s;ible he is of any thing that regards the Glory of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, whom he mo&s;t particularly loves and e&s;teems. Be&s;ides, that which compleats my Joys in this Juncture, is, that I hereby find an occa|&s;ion of demanding the good corre&s;pondence of your Pa|ternity, for whom I &s;hall ever entertain the e&s;teem I ought. Wherefore I adjure you mo&s;t heartily, to let me know your intentions, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with your good Coun&s;els, and you will find me ready to do any thing, e&s;pecially when the Glory of God, or the Inte|re&s;ts of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King are concerned. The&s;e Rea&s;ons have obliged me in the Name of the King my Ma&s;ter, to demand Father <HI>Trachard</HI> of the Reverend Superior to return into <HI>France,</HI> and I have intru&s;ted him with certain Affairs, which he is to communicate to your Paternity.</P>
<PB N="245" REF="152">
<P>I have pre&s;ented the Father Superior and my other Brethren who are come with him, to the King my Ma|&s;ter: His Maje&s;ty did me the honour to receive them with extraordinary Marks of Affection. He hath al&s;o honoured them with his Pre&s;ence, having no body near him but four of his chief <HI>Mandarins,</HI> when they ob|&s;erved the Eclip&s;e which happened the Eleventh of the Month of <HI>December.</HI> During all that time, his Ma|je&s;ty was not four foot di&s;tant from the Fathers who &s;ate, making u&s;e of their In&s;truments, and acting with as great freedom as if they had been in the Ob|&s;ervatory of <HI>Paris.</HI> Nay, the King had the goodne&s;s to call the Father Superior to him, and to order him to fit his Tele&s;cope, to the end his Maje&s;ty might the more ea&s;ily ob&s;erve; taking the In&s;trument out of the Fa|ther's hand, as if he had been his familiar Friend. During that Ob&s;ervation, he did the Fathers the ho|nour to be&s;tow upon each of them a Ca&s;&s;ock and Cloak of <HI>China</HI> Damask; and for Father <HI>Trachard,</HI> who will pre&s;ent you this Letter, he added a Golden Cruci|fix, that he might give him a faithful Companion for his Voyage (the&s;e are the King's own Words) char|ging the &s;ame Father to pre&s;ent another much bigger to your Paternity, with his particular de&s;ires that you would procure frum the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King twelve Fathers <HI>Mathematicians</HI> of the Society, who will be received here with much Joy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of catching Ele|phants.</NOTE>After the King had ob&s;erved the Eclip&s;e with us in the manner I have related, he invited us to participate in the Diver&s;ion which that day he gave in the Fore&s;t, for taking the Elephants which were there kept enclo&s;ed. We made rea|dy to &s;et out about &s;even of the Clock: Then we were told that my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;et out, and that the King was coming out of his Palace. Pre&s;ently after the Amba&s;&s;ador arrived on Hor&s;e-back with all his Retinue; the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis,</HI> the Abbot <HI>de Lyonne,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vachet</HI> attended him. No &s;ooner had all alighted from their Hor&s;es, and mounted the Elephants
<PB N="247" REF="153"> that were prepared for us, but the King appeared attended by a great number of <HI>Mandarins</HI> mounted on Elephants of War. We followed, and en|tered about a League into the Wood, as far as the Enclo&s;ure where the wild Elephants were. It was a &s;quare Park of about three or four hundred Geometrical Paces, paled in by great Stakes; however large Openings were left at convenient Di&s;tances, and within there were fourteen Ele|phants of all Sizes. So &s;oon as the Company came, they made a Ring of about an hundred E|lephants of War po&s;ted round the Park, to hin|der the Wild ones from breaking through the Pali&s;ado; we were behind this Ring, and near to the King. Twelve of the &s;tronge&s;t of the tame Elephants were &s;ent in within the Precincts of the Park, every one of them carrying two Men with great Ropes and running Noo&s;es, whereof the ends were made fa&s;t to the Elephants they rode upon. They pre&s;ently made up to the Elephant they had a mind to catch, who finding him&s;elf pur&s;ued, offered at the Barrier to break through and make his E&s;cape; but all the way was blocked up by Elephants of War, by whom they were forced back within the Inclo&s;ure again, and as they ran to and again within that Space, the Hunt&s;men, who were mounted on tame Ele|phants, threw their Noo&s;es &s;o exactly upon the places where the Bea&s;ts were to &s;et their Foot, that they never failed catching of them; Indeed, they were all taken in the &s;pace of an hour.</P>
<P>They afterwards tied every wild Elephant, and on each &s;ide of him put a tame one, which were to be left a Fortnight with him, that by their means he might be daunted.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="154">
<P>Among&s;t that Herd of wild Elephants, there were two or three very young and little ones. The King &s;aid he would &s;end one of them to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> but con&s;idering that the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> might be emulous and take Exceptions thereat, he added that he would al&s;o &s;end him one le&s;s, that &s;o there might be no Jealou&s;ie nor Di&s;pute betwixt them.</P>
<P>When the Hunting was over, the King told the Amba&s;&s;ador, that they had never had better &s;port in &s;o &s;hort a time, that Providence had &s;o order|ed it for his &s;ake, and that therefore they ought to give God thanks. He then prayed him to leave with him <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Mare.</HI> The Am|ba&s;&s;ador pre&s;ented him to him, and his Maje&s;ty pre&s;ently made the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> give him a Ve&s;t of Cloth of Silver with Gold Buttons. <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de la Mare</HI> is a very able Ingeneer, and a very hone&s;t Man: He hath long &s;erved both by Sea and Land; having from his Youth applied him&s;elf to the Mathematicks, wherein he hath made great progre&s;s. He is very skilful in Na|vigation, Fortification, and Geometry. On that occa&s;ion all the Gentlemen took their Leave of the King, who wi&s;hed them a happy Voyage, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with conde&s;cending Civility towards them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Amba&s;&s;a|dor takes his Audience of Leave of his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>The King returned to <HI>Thlee-pou&s;&s;onne,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Louvo.</HI> The King came there al|&s;o in the Evening, that next day he might give the Amba&s;&s;ador his Audience of Leave. <HI>Decem|ber</HI> the Twelfth, about eight of the Clock in the Morning, an <HI>Oya</HI> who is a <HI>Mandarin</HI> of the fir&s;t Rank, came with a pompous Train to wait upon the Amba&s;&s;ador from his Hou&s;e to Audience:
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="249" REF="154"> The Ceremonies were much the &s;ame that were ob&s;erved the Day of his Entry and fir&s;t Audi|ence, &s;ave that the Amba&s;&s;adors Gentlemen fol|lowed him no farther than into the &s;econd Court of the Palace. The Audience was not long: The King having charged the Amba&s;&s;ador with his Complements for the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and all the Royal Family, made him a Pre&s;ent of a great piece of golden Plate, which in the <HI>Siam</HI>-Lan|guage is called <HI>Telom,</HI> and in <HI>Portugue&s;e, Bol&s;eta,</HI> and is the Badge of a great <HI>Oya</HI> and Prince. None at the Court of <HI>Siam</HI> but only the Prince of <HI>Camboye</HI> is allowed to have the like. The Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> told the Amba&s;&s;ador from the King, that his Maje&s;ty would willingly have compleated the Ceremony which is ob&s;erved on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, but that he omitted it becau&s;e of &s;ome things, which perhaps would not be agree|able to the <HI>Europeans.</HI> His Maje&s;ty ordered a Crucifix, &s;uch as he had given me the day be|fore, to be pre&s;ented to the Abbot <HI>de Lyonne,</HI> and another to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vachet,</HI> whom he &s;ent to <HI>France</HI> to accompany his Amba&s;&s;adors. As they came from the Audience, a Table was prepared with above fifty Covers, in a neat Hall, in the middle of a Gra&s;s-plat, encompa&s;&s;ed with Water-works; all were &s;erved in large Di&s;hes of Plate, and the Plenty of Di&s;hes was no le&s;s con&s;iderable, than the Ragoes were delicious. No kind of Wine was wanting, and the Sweet-meats of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> were highly e&s;teemed above any thing that was there. The Amba&s;&s;ador and Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> would needs have us to be pre&s;ent at the Treat. When that &s;plendid Entertainment was over, the Amba&s;&s;ador embarked for <HI>Siam,</HI> being accompa|nied
<PB N="250" REF="155"> by a great many <HI>Mandarins</HI> of all the Or|ders. I &s;tayed with the Lord <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> till next day, and when I was to part from our Fathers, it troubled me extreamly to leave them. The Father Superior and other two would needs go a|long with me, and wait upon my Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dor on Shipboard.</P>
<P>Our Water-men rowed all night long, and <HI>December</HI> the Fourteenth, about &s;even a Clock in the Morning, we arrived at the Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;e in <HI>Siam.</HI> His Servants were employed in putting on board the <HI>China</HI> and other Furniture of his Palace, which the King had pre&s;ented him with. Before I left the City, I had a long Di&s;cour&s;e with Father <HI>Suarez</HI> and Father <HI>Fucity.</HI> The&s;e Fathers have learnt to &s;uffer without com|plaining, and as to that point they have a nice|ne&s;s of Con&s;cience that makes them ob&s;erve Mea|&s;ures, that the &s;tricte&s;t Morality could not always comply with. They only hinted to me that they had been &s;urpri&s;ed, that the Je&s;uits of the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;hould be accu&s;ed of taking Money (as it is pra|cti&s;ed in Pari&s;hes) for Admini&s;tring, Bapti&s;m, &s;aying Ma&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;eeing an infinite Number of People could bear Witne&s;s to the contrary, and they prote&s;ted to me before God that never any thing had been done, that might in the lea&s;t alter the Rule of our In&s;titution. I had long de&s;ired an Opportunity of being cleared as to a Matter of Fact that had made a Noi&s;e, but I had forgot to do it till then. I asked them if it was true, that a certain Mini&s;ter of <HI>Batavia,</HI> called <HI>Ferreira,</HI> was an Apo&s;tate Je&s;uit, as it was given out. They made me an&s;wer, that he had never been neither of our Company, nor of any other religious So|ciety,
<PB N="251" REF="155"> which he had acknowledged to &s;everal Per|&s;ons, and to Father <HI>Fucity</HI> him&s;elf at <HI>Batavia;</HI> that perhaps the thing that had given occa&s;ion to the Report, was the Conformity in Name which he had with a Je&s;uit, who is al&s;o called <HI>Ferreira,</HI> and who hath been formerly mentioned, from whence ground had been taken to confound the two into one Per&s;on. Would to God that the Original of &s;uch kind of Reports were only to be attributed to a bare Mi&s;take; for how many &s;uch have been of late years publi&s;hed in certain Libels that have flown about in <HI>Holland?</HI> Di&s;tance of Place hath in this favoured the Malicious, and the natural Inclination or Intere&s;t that Men have to give Credit to that that's Evil, has been the cau&s;e that &s;ome have believed it.

<P>The&s;e were very acceptable News to us, and e&s;pecially when they told us that the Engli&s;h Ship had made the Cape the Day before about &s;even Leagues off. We then found that we were much nearer it than we imagined, and next day ca&s;t|ing out the Lead, we found our &s;elves about &s;e|ven a Clock in the Morning, upon the Bank of the Needles, in ninety Fadom Water, and about Noon we made the Cape of the Needles. The Wind was then fair, and we made the be&s;t u&s;e of it all Night long, &s;o that next day we made the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope</HI> about eight Leagues off. A|bout three in the Afternoon we came to the Mouth of the Bay; but the Wind blowing too high for putting in, we came to an Anchor be|twixt I&s;le <HI>Robin</HI> and the main Land, near the Frigat.</P>
<P>The Day following, <HI>March</HI> the Thirteenth, the Wind being abated, we came to an Anchor in the Bay, among&s;t &s;even great Dutch Ships, that made up the Ea&s;t-India Fleet that was to re|turn to <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as three or four Ships more, which they daily expected, were come to the Cape.

We &s;aluted the Fort with &s;even Guns, and they returned us Gun for Gun. Whil&s;t we were taking in Water, and providing other ne|ce&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, I went to pay a Vi&s;it to the Governour, who had asked News of the &s;ix Je|&s;uits whom he had &s;een the Year before. He made me many Offers of Services, offering me a Friends Hou&s;e, if I would &s;tay a&s;hoar, becau&s;e the Ob&s;ervatory, which was pulled down to be

Being informed that I was to re|turn to the <HI>Indies</HI> with &s;everal other Je&s;uits, he added very obligingly, that all &s;hould be ready a|gain&s;t our Arrival, and invited me and all my Companions before hand, to come and refre&s;h our &s;elves there. After all the&s;e Civilities, he made me a Pre&s;ent of four lovely Tygers Skins, and of a little tame Bea&s;t which he had taken in his la&s;t Expedition; by the Hair and Size of it, it re&s;embles a Squirril, and had much the Shape of one, when he gave it me, he told me it was the implacable Enemy of Serpents, and was at cruel Wars with them.</P>
<P>It was then Vintage time, which was very far advanced; we eat of the Grapes of <HI>Africa</HI> that are plentiful, and have a rare good Ta&s;te. The White-wine is very delicate, and if the Dutch knew as well how to cultivate Vines, as to make Colonies and pur&s;ue Trade, they might have ex|cellent Wines there of the other Colour.</P>
<P>The Governour told me that he was ju&s;t re|turned from a great Journey he had made up into the Country Northward, where he had di&s;cover|ed many Nations, who have &s;ome Form of Go|vernment, and well ordered Oeconomy, as may be &s;een in the De&s;cription of the <HI>Cape of Good-hope.</HI></P>

For as to the Orientals, all know that they tell things not really as they are, but as they fancy you could wi&s;h they were; wherefore they little care to contradict one another, as to matter of Fact they have declared, provided they comply with the inclinations of him that puts the que&s;tion to them; &s;o that if they be taken in any contradicti|on, it does not at all trouble them to be told of it. What plea&s;ed you ye&s;terday, will they &s;ay unconcernedly, di&s;plea&s;es you to day, and that makes us &s;peak to day in another manner than we &s;pake ye&s;terday.

From the Doctrine of <HI>Thevathat</HI> as out of a &s;ource of Schi&s;m &s;even other Sects are &s;prung which have a great deal of affinity one with another, and that Tradition they apply to the Here&s;ies of the Dutch, Engli&s;h, and other people &s;eparated from the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for they look upon them as &s;o many &s;hoots &s;prung from our Religion, and that confirms them the more in their Opinions.</P>
<P>After all the outrages that <HI>Thevathat</HI> had done to his Brother without any re&s;pect to Nature or even to Divinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thevathat</HI> is puni&s;hed in Hell for ha|ving per&s;ecu|ted his Brother</NOTE> It was but ju&s;t he &s;hould be puni&s;hed. And &s;o the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Scriptures make mention of his puni&s;hment, and <HI>Som|monokhodom</HI> him&s;elf relates that after he be|came God, he &s;aw that wicked Brother of his in the deepe&s;t place of Hell. He was in the eight Habitation, that is to &s;ay, in the place where the greate&s;t Offenders are tormented, and there by a terrible puni&s;hment, he expiated, all the &s;ins that he had committed, and e&s;pecially the injuries he had done to me. Explaining after|wards the pains which <HI>Thevathat</HI> was made to &s;uf|fer, he &s;ays that he was fa&s;tened to a Cro&s;s with great nails, which piercing his hands and feet, put him to extreme pain, that on his head he had a Crown of Thorns, that his Body was
<PB N="296" REF="183"> full of wounds, and to compleat his Mi&s;ery, the Infernal place burnt him without con&s;uming of him. So &s;ad a &s;pectacle moved him to compa&s;&s;i|on; he forgot all the wrongs his Brother had done him, and could not &s;ee him in that condition with|out taking a re&s;olution to help him. He propo&s;ed to him then the&s;e three words to be adored, <HI>Ppu thang, Thamang, Sangkhang;</HI> &s;acred and my&s;terious words for which the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> have a profound ve|neration, and whereof the fir&s;t &s;ignifies God, the &s;econd the word of God, and the third the imita|tor of God; promi&s;ing him, that if he would accept &s;o ea&s;ie and rea&s;onable a condition, to deliver him from all the pains to which he was condemned. <HI>Thevathat</HI> con&s;ented to adore the fir&s;t two words, but he never would adore the third, becau&s;e it &s;ignified Prie&s;t or Imitator of God, prote&s;ting that Prie&s;ts were &s;inful Men that de&s;erved no re&s;pect. To puni&s;h him for that Pride, he &s;till &s;uffers and will &s;uffer for a great many years to come.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Talapoins</HI> take the <HI>Sia|me&s;e</HI> off from turning Chri|&s;tians, by per|&s;wading them that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>The|vathat</HI> the Brother of their God.</NOTE>Tho there be many things that keep the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> at a di&s;tance from the Chri&s;tian Law, yet one may &s;ay, nothing makes them more aver&s;e from it than this thought. The &s;imilitude that is to be found in &s;ome points betwixt their Religion and ours, making them believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the very &s;ame with that <HI>Thevathat</HI> mentioned in their Scriptures, they are per&s;waded that &s;eeing we are the Di&s;ciples of the one, we are al&s;o the followers of the other, and the fear they have of falling into Hell with <HI>Thevathat,</HI> if they follow his Doctrine, &s;uffers them not to hearken to the propo&s;itions that are made to them of embracing Chri&s;tianity. That which mo&s;t confirms them
<PB N="297" REF="183"> in their prejudice, is that we adore the Image of our Crucified Saviour, which plainly repre&s;ents the puni&s;hment of <HI>Thevathat.</HI> So when we would explain to them the Articles of our Faith; they take us always up &s;hort, &s;aying that they do not need our In&s;tructions, and that they know already better than we do, what we have a mind to tell them.</P>
<P>But it is time to return to <HI>Sommonokhodom</HI> who&s;e Story we have interrupted; he had run over the World, declaring to Mankind good and evil, and teaching them the true Religion, which he him&s;elf wrought that he might leave it to Po&s;te|rity. He had even gained &s;everal Di&s;ciples, who in the condition of Prie&s;ts were to make a parti|cular Profe&s;&s;ion of imitating him, in wearing a habit like to his, and in ob&s;erving the Rules that he gave them, when, at length, he attained to the four&s;core and &s;econd year of his age, which was al&s;o the Age of that Mon&s;ter, which hereto|fore he killed as we have already &s;aid. One day as he &s;ate in the middle of his Di&s;ciples teaching them, he &s;aw the &s;ame Mon&s;ter in &s;hape of a Pig, running with incredible Fury, and he made no doubt but that it had a de&s;ign to be revenged. Knowing then that the time of his departure out of the World drew nigh, he foretold it to his Di&s;ciples, and &s;hortly after having eaten a piece of the Pig which he had &s;een, he was taken with a violent Cholic which killed him.</P>
<P>His Soul a&s;cended to the eight Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein con|&s;i&s;ts the Anni|hilation of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> God.</NOTE> which is properly Paradi&s;e called <HI>Nyruppaam,</HI> it is no more &s;ubject to mi&s;eries and pain, but there enjoys per|fect bli&s;s. For that rea&s;on it will never be born again, and that is the thing they call being anni|hilated.
<PB N="298" REF="184"> For by that term they under&s;tand not the total de&s;truction of a thing reduced to nothing; but their meaning is, that one appears no more upon Earth, tho he live in Heaven. His body was burnt; and his bones, as they &s;ay, have been pre&s;erved to this pre&s;ent. One part of them are in the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and the other in <HI>Siam.</HI> They attribute a wonderful Virtue to the&s;e bones, and they affirm that they &s;hine with a Divine &s;plendor. Before he died, he ordered his Picture to be drawn after his Death, for fear Men might by little and little &s;uffer his Per&s;on to wear out of their remembrance, and at long run forget him for good and all. He would have the &s;ame ho|nours rendred to him in that Image which were due to his Divinity. He left al&s;o the print of one of his feet in three different places, in the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Ceilan.</HI> People go thither in Pilgrimage from all parts, and yearly honour the&s;e prints with &s;ingular Devotion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> with great re|verence pre|&s;erve the hair and picture of their God.</NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> pretend al&s;o that they have part of <HI>Sommonokhodom</HI>'s hair, which he had cut off af|ter he became God: The other part was by An|gels carried up into Heaven. It is their cu&s;tom to upbraid us that we have not re&s;pect enough for holy Images, for Sacred Books, and for the Prie&s;ts. The Truth is, no People can have great|er Veneration for tho&s;e things than they have. By a precept of their Law they are commanded to honour them: but it is not enough for them to re&s;pect the Prie&s;ts and the Divine Scriptures; the Ve&s;tments of the one, and the Characters of the other wherein their Law is written, is to them al&s;o an object of Religious Wor&s;hip. Nay they
<PB N="299" REF="184"> think it a mo&s;t laudable action, and excellent virtue to do good to the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> and that their Cloaths and the Beads which they receive from them have the power to cure Di&s;ea&s;es. They imagine al&s;o that in their Books there is a divine virtue, and that if one under&s;tood it and knew how to u&s;e the words of them, he might work great wonders. And therefore of the three ways of working Miracles; the fir&s;t is to under&s;tand aright how to make u&s;e of the word of God; the &s;econd, to be in&s;tructed in the Doctrine of the Anchorites; and the third is the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of De|vils. This la&s;t, however, they condemn, but they mightily approve of the two former, boa&s;t|ing that they alone know the&s;e admirable &s;e|crets.</P>
<P>For the proof of their Religion they reckon up &s;everal Fables,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Oracles whereby the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Au|thori&s;e their Religion.</NOTE> which pa&s;s among&s;t them for &s;o many authentic Miracles. And the&s;e are &s;ome of the chief of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> where the Re|licks of <HI>Sommonokhodom</HI> are kept, his bones part|ly changed into &s;everal Metals, and partly in their natural &s;tate &s;hines with an extraordinary brightne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the &s;ame Kingdom there is a little I&s;le in the middle of a River, wherein there is a Tem|ple of their God, this little I&s;le, let the waters be never &s;o high, even when the highe&s;t places are overflowed, remains dry. They add, that the Pre&s;ents which are offered to God by ca&s;ting them into the River, according to the Cu&s;tom of that
<PB N="300" REF="185"> Countrey, run along with the Stream, until arri|ving at the I&s;le, they &s;top there, and will go no farther.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Storms at Sea, when Seamen are in dan|ger of being ca&s;t away, they throw a Ring into the Sea with an intention to offer it to the Tem|ple of the I&s;le, and all of a &s;udden the Sea be|comes calm, and the Ship is out of danger.</P>
<P N="4">4. Upon the Borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> there is a little hill, where they have a Traditi|on that God went often. A va&s;t multitude of People go thither yearly in Pilgrimage, and tho the top of it be very narrow, yet it holds all that come upon it, and is never full of Pilgrims.</P>
<P N="5">5. They al&s;o &s;ay that on the top of that little hill, there is a great Trea&s;ure of Gold, Silver, and other precious things, which the&s;e Pilgrims offer to God, when they come there. They tell how an Army of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> having one day carried away that Trea&s;ure, was next day wholly de&s;troy|ed, and the Riches carried back by Angels to the place where it was before.</P>
<P N="6">6. Tho the top of the little hill be altogether expo&s;ed to the Weather, and heat of the Sun, yet there is always a &s;hade upon it; that even at noon, guards the people from the exce&s;&s;ive heats which they would &s;uffer there without that.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the Town of <HI>Sokhotai</HI> there is an Idol all of Gold: they pretend that that is a Mirculous Statue, and that if when Rain is wanting, it be carried
<PB N="301" REF="185"> into the Fields, as u&s;ually it is, immediately Rain falls in great abundance.</P>
<P N="8">8. In another Town which is called <HI>Campeng,</HI> there is, as they &s;ay, a Lake, wherein to this day there is to be &s;een a living Fi&s;h, which hath but the half of its Body, and the manner how that Prodigy was wrought is remarkable. Heretofore a Holy Man lived in that Town; who having a broiled Fi&s;h pre&s;ented before him, he ate but one half of it, and threw the other into the Lake de|&s;iring that it might live. His wi&s;h was granted him, in con&s;ideration of his great merits; for at this very pre&s;ent the &s;ame half Fi&s;h is &s;till alive in the Lake.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious here to relate all their other raveries, we &s;hall only take notice that building upon an infinite number of Prodigies of this Nature, in di&s;puting with us, they challenge us to &s;how &s;ome Miracles in confirmation of the Doctrine we Preach. They brag to us of certain Bra&s;s and Stone-&s;tatues, which they believe were heretofore Men, and by a divine Virtue rendered inanimate. They have al&s;o, as they &s;ay, many ancient Works, made by the hand of Angels. In conclu&s;ion all the Effects which we attribute to Magic, they take to be &s;o many amazing won|ders, and they are proud that they alone have the art to do them.</P>
<P>There are certain <HI>Talapoins</HI> among&s;t them who have embraced a State of life called <HI>Vipi&s;ana.</HI> Nothing can be more Au&s;tere, they ob&s;erve perpetual &s;ilence, always appli'd to the Contemplation of Divine things, and they have the Reputation of being great Saints. The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> believe that they continually conver&s;e with Angels, that what is mo&s;t admirable in nature, is always pre&s;ent to their mind, and that their
<PB N="302" REF="186"> Eyes pierce even into the mo&s;t hidden Mines, where they clearly &s;ee, Gold, Silver, all Metals, and all &s;orts of Precious Stones.</P>
<P>As to manners and the way of living, a Chri|&s;tian cannot enjoyn any thing more perfect than what their Religion pre&s;cribes to them. It com|mands them to do good, and not only prohibits them bad actions, but al&s;o every &s;inful de&s;ire, thought and intention. And that makes them &s;ay that their Law is impracticable, or at lea&s;t, very hard to be kept as it ought to be, and, indeed they think that they &s;hall all go to Hell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> contains ten very &s;evere Precepts.</NOTE>Their whole Law is comprehended in ten Commandments as ours is; but it is much &s;everer, for be&s;ides that with them neither nece&s;&s;ity nor any other Circum&s;tance excu&s;es a Man that &s;ins, many things which among Chri&s;tians are only of perfection and Council, pa&s;s with them for indi&s;|pen&s;able Precepts.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of all intoxicating Liquors are for|bidden to them. They are not &s;o much as per|mitted to ta&s;te Wine what&s;oever need they may be in, or what&s;oever occa&s;ion may pre&s;s them, and they are extreamly &s;candalized when they &s;ee Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts drink of it. They cannot with|out a &s;in kill any living Creature, nay it is a Crime to go a Hunting, to &s;trike a Bea&s;t, and to do it hurt any manner of way. The rea&s;on they give for that is that Bea&s;ts having life as well we, are &s;en&s;ible of pain as well as we, and &s;ince we are not willing that any body &s;hould hurt us, it is not rea&s;onable that we &s;hould hurt them. Nay they accu&s;e us of ingratitude, becau&s;e we put to death innocent Creatures who have rendred us &s;o
<PB N="303" REF="186"> many Services. For that rea&s;on they are obliged to practi&s;e Charity not only towards Men, but towards Bea&s;ts al&s;o, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their nece&s;&s;ities. They have &s;o great a re&s;pect to their Scriptures, that they dare not tru&s;t them in our hands, no nor explain their Law to us, le&s;t that expo&s;ing it to our diri&s;ion, we might be guilty of &s;ome irreverence, and the &s;in of that be impu|ted to them. They often upbraid us with the way we carry holy Images, and read the holy Scriptures, as being not re&s;pectful enough. After all, the <HI>Talapoins</HI> who are their Prie&s;ts, Monks and Doctors are looked upon as the true follow|ers of God. They have little Commerce with the World, never &s;alute a Lay-man no not the King. And that's the rea&s;on why it offends the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> to &s;ee the European Prie&s;ts u&s;e familiarity with Seculars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Talapoins</HI> go every Morning a begging, and the opinion People have of their Virtue makes every one give them &s;omewhat. And indeed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of Morality which they Preach, is that to be &s;aved, men mu&s;t erect or repair Pagods, and above all things a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Talapoins.</HI></P>
<P>The Lay-men have eight principal Command|ments which con&s;i&s;t, 1. In adoring God, his Word, and tho&s;e who imitate his Virtues. 2. Not to &s;teal. 3. Not to drink Wine, nor any Liquor that intoxicates. 4. Not to lye nor to deceive any body. 5. Not to kill Men nor Bea&s;ts. 6. Not to commit Adultery. 7. To fa&s;t on Holy-days. 8. Not to labour on tho&s;e days. The&s;e are the Duties which the Prie&s;ts explain to the People, and in&s;truct them in, in their Ser|mons.</P>
<PB N="304" REF="187">
<P>The Mona&s;teries of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> are &s;o many Seminaries where Youth are bred. Thither are all Children of Quality &s;ent, as &s;oon as they are capable of in&s;truction, and whil&s;t they continue there, they are made to lead a very au&s;tere life. They are called <HI>N&eacute;n;</HI> and have their particular Rules and Precepts, which con&s;i&s;ts in wearing a yellow Garment, and having their Head and Eye|brows &s;haved twice a Month, the fourteenth and twenty ninth of the Moon, to fa&s;t tho&s;e two days, and al&s;o three other Holy-days, which happen the fifteenth, twenty third, and la&s;t day of the Moon, to eat only twice a day, in the Morning and at Noon, without permi&s;&s;ion to take a bit of Food more till next day, to have no Commerce with any Woman, never to &s;ing a Song, nor to hear tho&s;e that do &s;ing, not to play upon any In&s;truments, to avoid public Shows and Rejoycings, not to u&s;e Perfumes, not to love Money, which they are not &s;o much as to touch, far le&s;s to hoard it up, not to take plea|&s;ure in the ta&s;te of what they eat, and to divert their thought from that; which is the rea&s;on that &s;everal of them mingle &s;omewhat with what is given them, to render it le&s;s agreable; In fine to honour their Prie&s;ts, to give them the hand, and to &s;it always below them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Talapoins</HI> lead a more au&s;tere life; for be|&s;ides that they have all the obligations of Lay-man and of the youth whom they breed, they have over and above more than &s;ix&s;core rules proper to their &s;tation, whereof the&s;e are the chief.

<P>The <HI>Talapoins</HI> make frequent di&s;cour&s;es to the People to exhort them to the Practice of Virtue, and particularly of Charity towards Men and Bea&s;ts. He that Preaches, &s;its, after the manner of the Country, upon a little Theatre or Stage, covered with Carpet, and very high above the Auditory. When the People are gathered toge|ther, he begins and reads a &s;entence of <HI>Sommonock|hodom</HI> with a mode&s;t and grave Countenance; looking always down with his Eyes, and u&s;ing no ge&s;tures, then he unfolds the Fabulous My&s;teries of that Book, and draws from thence &s;ome Moral doctrine for the in&s;truction of his Auditory, making u&s;e of Metaphors, Parables, and above all of compari&s;ons taken from natural things, as it is the cu&s;tom of the Orientals. The People &s;it hurk|ling and li&s;ten with much reverence and attention, the Men being on the one &s;ide, and the Women on the other. The re&s;t of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> are at the Preachers &s;ide, but &s;eparated from the People, and &s;itting on a half pace. All the hearers have their hands joyned, and as &s;oon as the Preacher hath &s;po|ken the Text, they cry all together with hands lifted up to heaven, and bowing down the head, <HI>The word of God, mo&s;t pure Truth.</HI> They have like us a kind of Sunday every &s;eventh day, which they &s;pend in Fa&s;ting and Prayer, be&s;ides &s;ome other more &s;olemn Holy days, which la&s;t three days, and which are celebrated &s;ometimes in one Pagod, and &s;ometimes in another, with an extraordinary con|cour&s;e of People. The Women are the mo&s;t &s;o|licitous
<PB N="307" REF="189"> to go to tho&s;e meetings of Piety. During that time they Preach from &s;ix of the Clock in the Morning to &s;ix a Clock at Night, fre&s;h Preachers &s;ucceeding one another, and Preach|ing &s;ix whole hours by turns. The&s;e long di&s;|cour&s;es are not tedious to the Auditory, who al|ways hearken with reverence without coughing or turning the head.</P>
<P>And thus you have what I could learn of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Religion, which till now hath been &s;o unknown in <HI>Europe.</HI> But if one do but in the lea&s;t examin what we have &s;aid of it; he'l find &s;o many things that have &s;ome re&s;emblance with the Chri&s;tian doctrin, that it may be ea&s;ily judged the Go&s;pel hath been heretofore Preached to that Nation, which in progre&s;s of time hath been al|tered and corrupted by the ignorance of their Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>I can &s;ay nothing in particular as to the pre&s;ent State of Chri&s;tianity in <HI>Siam.</HI> It is &s;trange that the Gop&s;el &s;hould make &s;o &s;mall Progre&s;s among&s;t people, who are zealou&s;ly and carefully cultivated, who daily &s;ee the Maje&s;ty of our Ceremonies, &s;o proper for giving an idea of our My&s;teries, who be&s;ides have no vice that may make them di&s;like our Maxims, and who have &s;o great an e&s;teem for the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> becau&s;e they make profe&s;&s;ion of an au&s;tere life.
