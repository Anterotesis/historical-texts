<P>AFter my Love to thee and thy wife, and the re&s;t of my beloved Friends in the Truth, in the which, as we abide, we are a Flock; yea, we are a pure Family of Love, the Hou&s;hold and Children of the living God, in whom he will be glorifi'd, in carrying of his Lambs and Babes in the Arms and Ark of his everlasting power, over all the &s;welling and raging Waves of the Enemy, both within and without; to the joy of all his Faithful ones; and to the Glory and Renown of his holy Name, who over all in Hea|ven and Earth, and every where is ble&s;&s;ed for ever and ever more.</P>
<P>Dear Frind,<LB> I Comeing to Town, and hearing of <HI>John Walley</HI> (him by whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent to me) who being ju&s;t ready to Sail for <HI>London,</HI> could not omit to write the&s;e few lines unto thee: But my bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t this time was to build up &s;omething over our) never to forgotten) Friends Graves, whom the Apo&s;tate Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>New-England</HI> had hanged on a Tree, and buryed neer the Countreys High|way &s;ide; the Lord having put it into my heart, that now was a fit and &s;ea&s;onable time, it being a day of great Calamity and di&s;tre&s;s up|on mo&s;t part of <HI>New-England;</HI> For the Natives are ri&s;en in great wrath and fury again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> breaking in upon many places with fireing of Hou&s;es, and torturing of &s;undry per&s;ons with &s;everal &s;orts of Tortures: And it is reported they hang up &s;ome alive in Iron Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ks, by the under Jaw untill Death, burying &s;ome alive by de|grees,
<PB N="4" REF="3">and Skinning others alive. And &s;ome they carry away it is not known whither, but it is thought to Torture them after the mo&s;t horrid ways they can invent; and here are great bu&s;les in Pre&s;&s;ing Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ending out to War. But the <HI>Indians</HI> (as a Scourge in the hand o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord) goe on with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">lty and &s;ucce&s;s, upbraiding and c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">llenging the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Warr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ers when they &s;ee them, and &s;aying, <HI>Come, why do ye not fight?</HI> So that in a little time they have much &s;ur|prized, and made great &s;laughters upon the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> and although they had great &s;tore of Ammunition of their own, yet they get much more by Rifling of Hou&s;es, and Slaughtering Souldiers out of the Thick|ets and Swamps, as they March and Travel along the Woods. They lately met with a Captain and his Company as they were pa&s;&s;ing o|ver a Swamp; and at one Volley of Shot &s;lew him, and neer all his Company. The <HI>Indians,</HI> I hear, in&s;ult very much, and tell the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Warriers that God is again&s;t them, and for the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hall (for their Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s) fall into their hands. Our Rulers, Officers, and Councellors are like as men in a maze, not knowing what to do: but the Prie&s;ts &s;pur them on, telling them the <HI>Indians</HI> are ordained for de&s;truction; bidding them go forth to Warr, and they will Fa&s;t and Pray at home in the mean time: yet their Gene|ral, with &s;ome other Officers, complain and &s;ay, with tears, They &s;ee not God go along with them. And many of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when the Natives have killed them, they &s;trip them naked, and leave their bo|dies to rot upon the ground. I heard &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> did &s;ay to &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> That they did not think the <HI>Quakers</HI> would come out again&s;t them: I have not yet heard of much hurt they have done to Friends; but it is likely to be a time of great tryal to all here.</P>
<P>What I had to get upon our Friends Graves being ready framed a|forehand, I got two Friends to help me to &s;et it up in the night, a Court of Guard being kept very neer; but it being pretty dark, we did our work without interruption; &s;o next day, pretty early, tiding was brought into Town, that there was a Tombe built upon the two <HI>Qua|kers</HI> Grave by the Gallows; and it being a Market day, it is &s;aid, ma|ny hundreds, of Town and Country, flock'd about it, Reading, taking, and giving Copeys of the In&s;cription which was Engraven upon the Front end of the Work: And much people were &s;eriou&s;ly affected, &s;ay|ing, one to another, that the de&s;troying of tho&s;e good people, is that which hath brought the Di&s;plea&s;ure and Judgment of the Lord upon this Countrey: But the Prie&s;ts and Rulers, it being General Court time, hearing of it, and the great Concour&s;e of people which gathered
<PB N="5" REF="3">about it, in the evening, it being the la&s;t day of the week, they &s;ent &s;ome to pull it in pieces, and to bring the Table, with the In&s;cription, to the Governour, and General Court. When it was Demolli&s;hed, divers people, who afterwards came from divers Towns to &s;ee it, lo&s;t their labours. But notwith&s;tanding the rage of the Enemy, it hath pro|ved very good &s;ervice, and to the torment of the blood guilty; and it ri&s;eth in the hearts of many people afre&s;h. So, my Dear Friend, with true Love, I Re&s;t,</P>

<SALUTE>My well beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the remembrance of true Love to the, and the re&s;t of dear Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This may inform thee, that a mo&s;t bitter Spirit is entred the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> in which they greatly endea|vour the utter de&s;truction one of another: &s;o that the Face of the &s;tate and condition of this Country, to all that &s;ees, &s;eems very &s;ad, and dole&s;ome; and the fearful day of Gods mo&s;t righteous Judge|ments according to his unchangeable Word, &s;poken by his faithful Servants, and Prophets, &s;eems now, like a mighty and terrible one, to come upon this wicked, and adulterated Place, and People: and al|though they do fa&s;t, and pray often, yet &s;till &s;tands in them, fa&s;t root|ed, the evil Tree, and they &s;till delight to &s;mite with the Fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s, even all them who faithfully reprove Iniquity in the gate; and their evil hearts are much hardned So that, although Plagues, and Perplexities come in upon them, like an overflowing Stream, yet their wi&s;e <HI>Achitophels</HI> feed them&s;elves fat, without fear, as for a day of &s;laughter, whil&s;t many of our mi&s;erable Inhabitants lye naked, wallowing in their blood, and dying; and whil&s;t the Bar|barous enraged Natives, from one part of the Country, to another, are on Fire, flaming forth their fury, &s;poiling Cattle and Corn,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and burning Hou&s;es, and torturing Men, Women, and Children; anf burning them alive. Ye&s;terday came news to mine Ear, that a few Miles off, the <HI>Indians</HI> came to a Hou&s;e, and catch'd a Child of half a Year old, from its Mother, and another about ten Years old; both which they carried to the other &s;ide of a River, where they made a Fire; and in &s;ight of the tender Mother, they took up the younge&s;t by one Leg, and held it aloft, and &s;aid, &s;ee you, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman, (or to that purpo&s;e) and &s;o threw it into the Fire, and burnt it; and &s;o it's &s;uppo&s;ed, they de&s;troytd the other al&s;o. I this day heard of one whom they were three days torturing to death; &s;o it plainly appears <HI>New-Englands</HI> unparalel'd day is now come upon them&s;elves. Divers of the Prie&s;ts (I heard) gathered together to con&s;ider what might be the cau&s;e that the Hand of the Lord is thus &s;tretched forth again&s;t them: and one of them &s;aid, there &s;eems to be a thick Cloud between the Lord and our Prayers, and the Lord goes not forth with our For|ces; but on the very days that we Fa&s;t, and Pray before the Lord, do our Enemies give us the greate&s;t overthrows; and the la&s;t time we Fa&s;ted, we had the greate&s;t &s;laughter; and &s;ome confe&s;&s;ed that the greate&s;t cau&s;e might be in the Prie&s;ts, but they would not all agree to that; &s;o <HI>Babylon</HI> was, and is divided. One of their Prie&s;ts, on a Fa&s;t day, took his Text out of the <HI>44th</HI> P&s;alm, beginning at the <HI>9th.</HI> Ver&s;e, and read to the <HI>14th.</HI> but Preached on the <HI>9th. But thou ha&s;t ca&s;t off, and put us to &s;hame; and goe&s;t not forth with our Armies.</HI> Ver&s;e 10. <HI>Thou make&s;t us to turn back from the Enemy; and they which hat us, &s;poil us for them&s;elves.</HI> Ver&s;e 11. <HI>Thou ha&s;t given us like Sheep appointed for Meat, and ha&s;t &s;cattered us among the Heathen</HI> Ver&s;e 12. <HI>Thou &s;elle&s;t thy Peo|ple for nought, and do&s;t not encrea&s;e thy Wealth by their Peace.</HI> Ver&s;e 13. <HI>Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t us a reproach to our Neighbours, a &s;corn, and a Divi&s;ion to them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> are round about us.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> In&s;ult very much over our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces, Challenging them out to right: you &s;ay, &s;ay they, you will kill all the <HI>Indians;</HI> why come you not forth to fight? Sometimes they watch the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and will not &s;uffer them to bury their flain, but force them to flee before them; and then return, and &s;trip the flain naked, and leave their Bo|dies to rot above ground: now the&s;e things are come to pa&s;s, as was foretold by our Friends, the Servants of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord. A few days &s;ince, a Man, who had gotten one of <HI>George Bi&s;hop's</HI> Books of Friends &s;uffer|ings in <HI>New England,</HI> and reading a &s;aying there, wherein he te&s;ti|fied the days &s;hould &s;hortly come, that great Calamities &s;hould come upon that People; and that their Young Men &s;hould fall by the Sword,
<PB N="7" REF="4">and Worms &s;hall cover them; and the Cup which they had filled to to others, &s;hould be filled double to them&s;elves: This Man being pre&s;s'd in Spirit, went to the General Court, then &s;itting, with <HI>George Bi&s;hop's</HI> Book in his hand; and came &s;everal Miles out of the Coun|try: he told them he could not have re&s;t in his mind, until he came to &s;hew them that Book; and he delivered it to them, bidding them read &s;uch a place, and con&s;ider if he was not a true Prophet from the Lord, in what he had foretold; and whether it was not now come to pa&s;s: But they frowned hard upon him, and examined him if he went to the Publique Wor&s;hip, or nay; whereupon he demanded his Book again, but went away without it. Some of the Prie&s;ts do endeavour to charm the minds of the People, and to per&s;wade them that the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, fears, and horrors, that is come upon them in their lying down, and ri&s;ing up, is for that the Magi&s;trates do &s;uffer the Quakers, and other Hereticks to live among&s;t them; but others of them, tell the People in their Pulpits, that the great cau&s;e of Gods &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them, is the guilt of innocent blood, which from time to time, hath been &s;hed in the Land; and father &s;aid, that al|though the Lord had this Year taken away the Plague of Bla&s;ting the Wheat in the Field, yet a greater Plague hath he brought in its room; and if thus it doth continue, greater Plagues than the&s;e are like to en|&s;ue the next Year, even Pe&s;tilence, and Famine, with the Sword. Great is the Policy, and Wi&s;dome the Natives do Act withal; for they compa&s;s the out-&s;ides, and weake&s;t Towns in the Country; and gather the People, and drives of them in heaps, like Fi&s;hes before a Net and make them fly before them to the &s;tronge&s;t Towns for Refuge; and &s;ay, they will drive them down to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and to two or three more of their &s;tronge&s;t Towns, where they, for want, &s;hall &s;tarve, and fami&s;h one another, and at pre&s;ent (if the Lord &s;hew not mercy) they &s;eem as if they would de&s;troy, and roul up the re&s;t of our Nation, as a burden&s;ome, and men&s;truous Cloth, and ca&s;t it out of their Land; but ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall every one be that fears, and follows the Lord with an upright heart; for &s;uch he will make as a Wall of Bra&s;s, and he will be their deliverer, and their &s;trong Tower, henceforth and for ever more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
