<HEAD>The <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the <HI>Arguments</HI> for and again&s;t the BILL, for Prohibiting the Exportation of <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> from <HI>Ireland</HI> to Forreign Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Again&s;t the <HI>BILL</HI> it was &s;aid,</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THat this Bill pa&s;&s;ing would become a total Pro|hibition of the Exportation of Woollen Manu|factury from <HI>Ireland,</HI> becau&s;e the Bill prohi|bits it to all Forreign Parts; and the Duty upon it here in <HI>England</HI> is &s;o high, that it can never be brought hither; and under this Head it was &s;aid,</P>
<P>That this would put the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> upon making Cloth for their own wearing, which would be more prejudicial to <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e the Cloth imported from <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Ireland</HI> is of much greater Value than what is exported from <HI>Ireland</HI> to Forreign Parts, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth being worn there by the Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>It was further &s;aid, That this Bill opens all the Ports in <HI>England</HI> to receive <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool; and by that Means Wool coming up the Channel in &s;ight of the <HI>French</HI> Ports, would have an ea&s;ie Opportunity of running in thither: And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it being &s;o near a Cut over from the North part of <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would be carried thither, and from thence to Forreign Parts.</P>
<P N="2">II. That this would di&s;courage the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in
<PB N="2" REF="3"><HI>Ireland,</HI> and that it &s;eem'd not to be well tim'd, after the Di&s;tre&s;s the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had lately been in; and that it was the <HI>Engli&s;h Iri&s;h</HI> that were chiefly concerned in the Woollen Manufacture there.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid further, that the Allegations of the Bill were not true, <HI>viz. That great Quantities of the like Manufactures (to tho&s;e of</HI> England) <HI>have of late been Made, and are daily encrea&s;ing:</HI> And to di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ove the &s;aid Allegations, an ac|count was given, (taken as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;aid out of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Books) to &s;how thow more Woollen Mannfactury was exported out of <HI>Ireland</HI> from 1084. to 1687. than from 1693. to 1696. and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> the chiefe&s;t part thereof was the New Drapery of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="4 letters">s and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, and but little Cloth, which was the Old D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y of <HI>England;</HI> and that therefore the Old Drapery was not prejudiced thereby: And an Account was al&s;o given, how many Yards of Cloth was Imported into <HI>Ireland</HI> from <HI>England</HI> in a Year.</P>
<P N="3">III. It was alledged, That this was only the Concern of one place, <HI>viz. Exeter,</HI> and that that ought not to weigh with the Intere&s;t of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>And Notice was taken of a Paper printed for the Bill, and a Li&s;t of the Names of Per&s;ons lately gone from <HI>Exe|ter</HI> and <HI>Tiverton</HI> to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and it was &s;aid, that &s;everal Matters of Fact in the &s;aid printed Papers were fal&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The printed Paper a&s;&s;erts, that Wool was 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper in <HI>Ireland</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> a pound co&s;ting there but 6 <HI>d.</HI> being worth 9 <HI>d.</HI> here, which it was &s;aid was a Mi&s;take, and that it was but 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd thing was about Dying Wares being dear|er in <HI>England</HI> than <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was denyed; and it was &s;aid, that it could not be &s;o, becau&s;e all the Dying Wares was &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and therefore of Nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t be deare&s;t in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>As to the printed Li&s;t of the Names of about 150 Per&s;ons lately gone from <HI>Exon</HI> and <HI>Tiverton</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> a Per&s;on &s;aid he knew three of the Names, one where|of went above twenty years &s;ince, and the other two a long time agoe.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that Spinning the Wool was cheaper in <HI>Ireland</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> but not the Combing and Weaving.</P>
<P>And as to Soap, it was &s;aid, that but little was u&s;ed in a piece of Stuff, no more than to the Value of 3 <HI>d.</HI> a piece.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by a Gentleman, who lived long in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that,</P>
<Q><HI>Anno</HI> 1656. the Woollen Manufacture was attempted to be &s;et up by &s;ome, but they failed in it. 1679. Some again from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> made another attempt, which al&s;o mi&s;carried.</Q>
<P>But, 1684. It was again attempted, and &s;ucceeded, as to the New Drapery, but that as to the Old Drapery they can never &s;et up that, becau&s;e they have no Ful|lers Earth there.</P>
<P>It was further &s;aid, That, 1&s;t. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> mu&s;t bring their Wool to a Market where it will not vend, mean|ing <HI>England.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the Wool being brought hither unwrought, will lower the Price here, and glut the Market, and that will bring down the Rents of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And it was al&s;o &s;aid, That <HI>England</HI> gets much by <HI>Ireland,</HI></P>
<P>And &s;everal <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Statutes were quoted, as 13 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 2. 28 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 17. and 11 <HI>El. c.</HI> 10. which it was &s;aid, were to encourage the Woolen Manufactury there.</P>
<P>I will here add al&s;o the Sub&s;tance of what is contain|ed in a Print, Entituled, <HI>Some Thoughts on the Bill,</HI> &amp;c. That the Strength of all that can be &s;aid on that Sub|ject
<PB N="4" REF="4">may be laid together; and tho' it is &s;omewhat long, think the Arguments are in &s;hort the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. That <HI>England</HI> profits greatly by <HI>Ireland.</HI> Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. Near one third part of the Lands of that Kingdom belong to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who inhabit here, and have their Rents con&s;tantly return'd in ready Money.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mo&s;t of the Nobility and Gentry &s;pend their E&s;tates here.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>England</HI> &s;upplies <HI>Ireland</HI> with mo&s;t of the Com|modities they con&s;ume; that nine tenths of the People there, that are able to buy it, wear <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Ma|nufactures, and that <HI>England</HI> receives little from <HI>Ireland,</HI> their Cattle being prohibited, high impo&s;itions on their Tallow, Leather and Corn, and la&s;t year the Tonnage and Poundage was doubled on their Linnen and other Manufactures, and &s;uch as are &s;uffer'd to come, are ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us, or Materials for our Manu|factures.</P>
<P N="4">4. That what <HI>Ireland</HI> gets by Trade, centers all in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the Trade there is mo&s;tly carried on by <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Stocks.</P>
<P>And hereupon it is &s;aid, that we &s;eem to de&s;ire to get &s;o much from <HI>Ireland,</HI> that at la&s;t we may put them out of a condition to pay us any thing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> general Head is, what was urged at the Lord's Bar, that it may weaken the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, &s;o as to endanger the Lo&s;s of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And it is &s;aid, That it may not nece&s;&s;arily follow, that &s;o much the more Woollen Manufactures will be made in <HI>England,</HI> as is re&s;trained or de&s;troy'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that <HI>Holland, France,</HI> &amp;c. may get the Trade <HI>Ireland</HI> loo&s;es, and that what <HI>Ireland</HI> has done, has not le&s;&s;ened the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And then he comes, <HI>fol.</HI> 10. to the point, on which the
<PB N="5" REF="4">Stre&s;s of the Controver&s;ie depends, and that is, whet her the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> can &s;end their Manufactures cheaper to For|reign Markets than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and this the Author affirms they cannot, becau&s;e they want numbers of People, and Stocks, and Materials.</P>
<P>The Author &s;ays further, that they make only a &s;ew Stockings, Stuffs and Frizes, which are different from tho&s;e made in <HI>England,</HI> and yet they &s;end but few abroad, and that becau&s;e they pay le&s;s Wages in <HI>Ireland</HI> than here, they are not &s;o likely to drain our People away, and that none go there but &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;i|tated.</P>
<P>He argues, That tho&s;e who are in the Woollen Ma|nufacture there, will be forced to go to other Coun|tries, if this Bill pa&s;s.</P>
<P>And the la&s;t doubt is, whether the Law, if made, would take effect, it being the Intere&s;t of all <HI>Ireland</HI> to defeat it. And then again, the Bugbears of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> are &s;et up. And after all, the Author propo&s;es a gentler Method of doing the Work, and that is by &s;ecret Di&s;|couragements, and &s;o to let it decline by degrees.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For the <HI>BILL,</HI> and in An&s;wer to the <HI>Objections</HI> to it, it was &s;aid.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. It was acknowledged, That the Duties on Woollen Manufactures from <HI>Ireland</HI> are at pre&s;ent high, the Sub|&s;idy being lately doubled, which will &s;oon expire, and then they will come near to a level with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ome a little over, and &s;ome under; and yet notwith|&s;tanding, we find by daily experience, great Quantities of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Frizes, Broad cloth napt, and Stuffs, imported into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>If the prohibition put the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> upon making Cloath
<PB N="6" REF="5">for ther own wearing, in&s;tead of what now they take from <HI>England,</HI> it &s;eems then, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> can take to make|ing Cloath if they plea&s;e, and no doubt of it, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will never deny them the liberty of making what they them&s;elves wear, but have ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear that by degrees they will not only do that, but beat the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> quite out of their Trade to Forreign Mar|kets, which mu&s;t be the natural con&s;equence of their making the Woollen Goods &s;o much cheaper than we can.</P>
<P>That this Bill opens all the Ports of <HI>England</HI> to re|ceive <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool, is true, and with great rea&s;on, that one place may have it on as ea&s;ie terms as others, o|therwi&s;e the charge of Land-carriage, and other Charges and ill-conveniencies are &s;o great, that it makes 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> difference between places no further di&s;tant than <HI>Biddeford</HI> and <HI>Exon.</HI> And while&s;t all our Plantation Goods, and particularly Tobacco, which pays &s;o high a Duty, come up the Channel, and Wool is &s;ent from <HI>South|ampton</HI> to <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> and may al&s;o be &s;ent from any one Port to any other Port in <HI>England,</HI> and all un|der no other Security than Bond given to di&s;charge in <HI>England,</HI> there can be no greater danger here, nay much le&s;s, &s;eeing by this Bill it is provided, that the Bonds for Security &s;hall be given by &s;ufficient Per&s;ons, re&s;iding in or near the place where the Goods are &s;hipped, and &s;hall not be granted over to any Per&s;on, and that a particular account from time to time &s;hall be tran&s;mit|ted to <HI>England</HI> of all the Wool &s;hipt, and the Ships and Ma&s;ters Names, and to whom, and at what Port con&s;igned.</P>
<P>As to what was &s;aid, This would di&s;courage the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it was an&s;wered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, the Woollen Manu|factury
<PB N="7" REF="5">has not long been &s;et up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t was pre&s;erved before that time, and no doubt may be &s;o &s;till, without drawing &s;o many People from <HI>England</HI> as would certainly leave it, if the Wool|len Manufacture goes on there; and it is better that a good &s;trength remains in one Kingdom, than to divide it into both, by which means neither may be &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t a Forreign Enemy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho' the Woollen Manufactury be &s;uppre&s;s'd there, they have the &s;ame means of Improvement they had before; nay, greater, &s;ince our <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> take off &s;o great Quantities of their Provi&s;ions, Hor&s;es and Servants, which makes a compen&s;ation in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the prohibiting their Cattle from coming into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Soyl is very well adapted to produce Hemp and Flax, and &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h the Linnen Manufactury, which would find all due Encouragement from <HI>England,</HI> and employ great numbers of People, and &s;o would the Fi&s;hery, which might be carried on on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t to great advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. They &s;end great Quantities of Corn, Beef, Hides, Tallow, Butter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to Forreign Markets, and will ne|ver want means of improving their Countrey, and en|crea&s;ing their People, without giving &s;o great a Wound to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Truth of the Allegations in the Bill:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Accounts they them&s;elves gave, were a &s;uf|ficient Proof of them; for by them it appeared, great Quantities of New-draperies were exported (which altho' they endeavoured to &s;hrowd under the Name of Frizes, yet they are known to be Bays, Perpetuano's and Ser|ges) &s;uch as are made in divers parts of <HI>England,</HI> and a Witne&s;s on Oath declared, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Serges were preferred to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and were in great
<PB N="8" REF="6">demand at the &s;ame time that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Serges lay on hand, and would not &s;ell.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Woollen Manufactury had as yet increa&s;ed to no greater a height, (was &s;aid to be, as the Truth is) becau&s;e of the late War, which made Exportation from <HI>Ireland</HI> un&s;afe; and that Kingdom not being well &s;ettled, Per&s;ons were unwilling to adventure their Stocks, and to enlarge their Trades, but that nothing can hin|der their encrea&s;e now, if Peace continues, but this Bill.</P>
<P>Further it was &s;aid, That there was no doubt, but by degrees they would improve and encrea&s;e in their making of Cloth, for that all things grew to perfection by degrees, as the Woollen Manufacture did heretofore in <HI>England,</HI> and making of Lute-&s;trings and Allamodes was coming to it, and that nothing could hinder this in <HI>Ireland,</HI> having there the &s;ame Materials, and by degrees would have Workmen from <HI>England</HI> &s;ufficient, and a good profit ari&s;ing by it, Fullers Earth would be found there, or &s;ent from hence, or they may do as they do in <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> where they have no Fullers Earth, and yet make as fine Cloth as we do in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. It was &s;aid, That this was not the Concern of <HI>Exeter</HI> alone, but of all <HI>England,</HI> for there were pre&s;ent|ed to their Lord&s;hips at lea&s;t 18 Petitions from &s;everal parts of <HI>England,</HI> as from <HI>Norwich, Colche&s;ter, Bocking, London, Sudbury,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e from <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> who thought them&s;elves immediately concerned.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the parts of <HI>England</HI> are affected, where Wool is produced, in the price of their Wool, which would &s;oon be reduced to a very low rate, when the Manu|factury of it is decay'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. The encrea&s;e of the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Ire|land</HI> would draw People from all parts of <HI>England,</HI> who con&s;ume the Product of the Land.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P N="4">4. The able working People of <HI>England</HI> going over, would leave the Weak and Aged a Charge to the Pa|ri&s;hes, and on both accounts the Rents of <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t fall con&s;iderably.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Woollen Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> export|ed, was above half the Value of the whole Exportation, and that being lo&s;t mu&s;t needs al&s;o abate the Value of all the Lands in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Objections made to the Paper printed for the Bill.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> About Dying Wares being cheaper in <HI>England</HI> than <HI>Ireland,</HI> it was &s;aid, 1. That &s;uch Goods may be brought from any part of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Africa,</HI> directly to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the few &s;orts which come from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> as Logg-wood, Indico, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> draw back great part of the Cu&s;tom, when exported to <HI>Ire|land;</HI> particularly Logg-wood, &s;o much as that it may be afforded cheaper there than here; and altho' as yet Dy|ing Wares do not come in very great Quantities directly from other Parts to <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet they will do &s;o, as the Woollen Manufactury there encrea&s;es. And it might have been added, that there is lately gone from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Ireland</HI> a great Quantity of Red-wood, which is brought thither from <HI>Guinny</HI> cheap, altho' in <HI>England</HI> it is at a very high Price.</P>
<P>As to the Objection, that Wool &s;elling for 6 <HI>d. per lib.</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and at the &s;ame time in <HI>England</HI> for 9 <HI>d. per lib.</HI> was but 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> difference, Arithmetick determines that; for if what co&s;t in <HI>Ireland</HI> 100 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ells in <HI>England</HI> for 150 <HI>l.</HI> that is plainly 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> odds, and 6 <HI>d.</HI> to 9 <HI>d.</HI> bears the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>The Names of three Per&s;ons among&s;t 140 in the Print|ed Li&s;t were picked out; one whereof, as their Witne&s;s &s;aid, went a way 20 Years &s;ince; but being asked, he could
<PB N="10" REF="7">not &s;ay but there might be others of the &s;ame Names gone &s;ince, and he owned it was &s;even Years &s;ince he left <HI>Exon.</HI></P>
<P>About the Workman&s;hip it was own'd, that the Spin|ing was much cheaper in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and tho' it was &s;aid, that that was the lea&s;t part of the Work, yet the Clothiers know, that it is above half: And as the Manufacture en|crea&s;es, the re&s;ort of People skill'd in it will encrea&s;e; and <HI>Ireland</HI> being &s;o cheap a Countrey, when it is in Peace, the Workman&s;hip of all kinds mu&s;t be cheap too. The Per&s;on that Witne&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t that but three Penny worth of Soap was u&s;ed in a Serge, afterwards owned him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and in truth there is above three pound of Soap u&s;ed in a Serge, which is worth about One Shil|ling.</P>
<P>From the Account given of the fir&s;t Attempts that fail|ed to &s;ettle the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in 1656. and 1679, and that which afterwards did &s;ucceed in 1684. it was ob&s;erved, That all New Manufactures are begun with &s;ome difficulty, as the Woollen Manufacture it &s;elf formerly in <HI>England,</HI> and the Manufacture of Lute&s;tring and Allamodes lately here: And tho' at fir&s;t it &s;ucceed|ed not in <HI>Ireland,</HI> even in the New Drapery, yet after|wards it took effect, and to that Degree, that a Witne&s;s on Oath affirmed, that they make as good Serges in <HI>Ire|land</HI> as any where in <HI>England;</HI> and tho' as yet they are not come to perfection in Fine Cloth, nothing can hinder them from it in time, having, as before was &s;aid, the &s;ame Materials and Work-men, and all, &s;o much cheaper than we.</P>
<P>It was acknowledged by a Gentleman again&s;t the Bill, that bringing the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool hither would not prejudice the Price of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool; and it is not to bring it to a Market where there is no Vent; for it always did, and
<PB N="11" REF="7">always will find Vent here; and <HI>England</HI> will be much the better Market for it than <HI>Scotland,</HI> though it &s;hould even be permitted to go there.</P>
<P>As to the Gains <HI>England</HI> makes by <HI>Ireland,</HI> the clear Gains are not much, and <HI>England</HI> would pay too dear to part with their Woollen Manufactury for them: And whoever plea&s;es to look into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Statutes quoted, will find that they were only to prevent the Exportation of Wool, and not to encourage the Exportation of Cloth to Forreign Markets.</P>
<P>And now to give An&s;wer to &s;o much of the printed Pa|per, Entituled, <HI>Some Thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. as is not an&s;wered before:</P>
<P>The Author has written with much Art, and &s;aid a great deal that does not immediately concern the Que&s;ti|on, and but &s;lightly touched what does.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as to the Profit <HI>England</HI> gets by <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>England</HI> had need get &s;omething where it has been at &s;o va&s;t Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure, to deliver and protect <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This was got by <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the Woollen Ma|nufacture was &s;et up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and will be after that is &s;uppre&s;s'd there.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it &s;hould get by the E&s;tabli&s;hment or Continu|ance of the Woollen Manfactury, which mu&s;t unavoida|bly ruin our own, by getting a penny we &s;hould loo&s;e a pound.</P>
<P>If mo&s;t of their Nobility and Gentry &s;pend their E&s;tates here, it is becau&s;e they live where they like be&s;t, but as <HI>Ireland</HI> flouri&s;hes more and grows greater, as it mu&s;t do if they remain in Peace, and &s;uch a Bill does not pa&s;s, that Humour by degrees will alter, and they will have every thing as much to their Content
<PB N="12" REF="8">and Plea&s;ure there as here, and now they go as much to Forreign Parts as <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>England</HI> &s;upplies <HI>Ireland</HI> with mo&s;t of the Com|modities they con&s;ume is affirmed, and formerly it was &s;o, but before the War, the Ca&s;e began to alter, and they were more &s;upply'd by the return of their own Product and Manufactures &s;ent abroad then from <HI>England,</HI> and if a Peace continues there, and they go on with their Woollen Manufacture, they will &s;oon want nothing from <HI>England,</HI> but it's able working People and Manufacturers and Seamen.</P>
<P>And altho' <HI>England</HI> has prohibited their Cattle, yet a great deal of <HI>Tallow,</HI> &amp;c. comes hither, and <HI>Anno</HI> 7th. and 8th. of this King, An Act was made here to en|courage the Linneen Manufacture of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there|in it was Enacted, <HI>That it might be lawful to bring any &s;orts of Hemp or Flax, and all the Production thereof as Thread, Yarn and Linnen of the Growth and Manufacture of Ireland free from all manner of Cu&s;toms, Duties and Im|po&s;itions what&s;oever.</HI> It is true indeed, that the next year the Act which doubled the Sub&s;idies of Tonnage and Poundage, did by an over&s;ight (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) com|prehend Linnen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Ireland,</HI> which by the Wi&s;|dom of the Nation may be rectified.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, that the Trade in <HI>Ireland</HI> is carried on mo&s;tly by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks, but the Author is mi&s;informed in that particular, and will &s;oon find many Forreigners &s;end their Stocks thither when things are &s;etled, as they did before the War, and if they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks, yet that would be a great deteriment to <HI>England,</HI> to have the Stock drawn out of Trade here to be employ|ed there.</P>
<P>Concerning the weaking the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, it has had an An&s;wer, and further it may be &s;aid, that the
<PB N="13" REF="8"><HI>Iri&s;h</HI> them&s;elves &s;ay the Woollen Manufacture there, for Forreign Exportation is &s;mall, and if we Prohibit that, they will in all likelyhood make the Cloth they wear them&s;elves, which is much more, Where then is the weakning them? It is not fit that they &s;hould have an Acce&s;&s;ion of Strength by the Diminution of our own, who mu&s;t &s;upport our &s;elves and them too.</P>
<P>It is evident that as the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> make and vend more Woollen Goods abroad, we &s;hall vend the le&s;s, becau&s;e all Traders to Forreign Parts know, that the Goods they make are in imitation of Ours, and they are wi&s;e enough to &s;end &s;uch Goods as they find are E&s;teemed and will Sell; and &s;uch the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> make and &s;end; and the going off of many of our Woollen Manufactu|rers to <HI>Ireland,</HI> is too convincing a Proof to be denied, that the increa&s;e in one Kingdom mu&s;t be the decrea&s;e of the other.</P>
<P>And now the Author of <HI>Some Thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. is come to the main and indeed the only Point, on which the Controver&s;ie turns. And that is, Whether in <HI>Ireland</HI> they can make the &s;ame Woollen Manufactury cheap|er than in <HI>England;</HI> and this the &s;aid Author, Deter|mines in the Negative, but leaves us to &s;eek the Proof of it where we can find it; and &s;eeks to cloud the Matter with an ob&s;cure way of Arguing but &s;uch as every one mu&s;t &s;ee thorough, e&s;pecially &s;uch di&s;cern|ing Judgments as the Matter is now before. To make a long Notional Argument to prove that two and two makes four, or any other certain Propo&s;ition in Arith|metick; or to argue again&s;t the Truth of Addition or Sub&s;traction of Sums without Numeration; is equally ab&s;urd. And therefore the plain An&s;wer to that, is the account which follows.</P>

<P>So that a Piece of Serge which co&s;ts in <HI>Ireland</HI> but <HI>l.</HI> 1.7.11. co&s;ts in <HI>England l.</HI> 1.19.3. which is 40 <HI>per cent.</HI> difference be&s;ides the Exchange.</P>
<P>And if the Advocates for the Woollen Manufactury in <HI>Ireland</HI> would &s;ucceed, <HI>They Ought to di&s;prove one of the&s;e two Points.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That either this Account is Fal&s;e, and in what Particulars; Or,</P>
<P N="2">2ly. That if the &s;ame Sorts of Woollen Manufactury are made in <HI>Ireland</HI> 40 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> cheaper than in <HI>England,</HI> and thence Exported into Forreign Parts: That For|reigners will for the &s;ake of <HI>England,</HI> Buy Engli&s;h at dearer Prizes, or that Engli&s;h Merchants, will to their lo&s;s &s;end Engli&s;h rather than Iri&s;h. But the&s;e are &s;o &s;elf-evident, that they may as well attempt to prove it is Night at Noon-Day. And therefore let the Con&s;e|quence be what it will to <HI>Ireland,</HI> it can never be &s;up|po&s;ed, that the Lords or Commoners who&s;e E&s;tates, and Families, and Intere&s;ts are in <HI>England,</HI> will ever yield
<PB N="15" REF="9">this Point to the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> The Ca&s;e with <HI>England</HI> is not the &s;ame as formerly: Heretofore our Neighbours had no great Strength at Sea; and then Forreign Trade which is the Foundation and Maintenance of our Ship|ping and Cu&s;toms was not of &s;uch ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity as now it is. The <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> are now grown Powerfull in Shipping and Sea Force, and <HI>England</HI> being an I&s;land mu&s;t at all times be able to cope with all its Neighbours in Strength at Sea, or it will &s;oon become a Prey to Forreigners. And this can be done by no other means but the mo&s;t vigorous Promotion of our Forreign Trade; and the Woollen Manufacture is &s;o great and e&s;&s;ential a part of it, and that on which all the re&s;t Depends, That with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion it &s;eems to be no Policy, &s;o much as to connive at the lea&s;t Diminu|tion, or to allow of the lea&s;t Di&s;couragement of it.</P>
<P>And while&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> did formerly, and may &s;till go on with Tillage and other Trades greatly to their ad|vantage, without the Linnen Manufacture, and e&s;pecial|ly while&s;t <HI>England</HI> &s;eems to be inclined by all ways and means, to encourage their Proceeding upon the Linnen-Manufacture, they will have no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>The Author &s;ays, <HI>Ireland</HI> is not likely to drain <HI>Eng|land</HI> of People, becau&s;e they pay le&s;s Wages there, as the Promoters of the Bill a&s;&s;ert, but if the Advice of a very ingenious Gentleman who has written of Trade, were follow'd, to reckon by Political Arithmetick, this Au|thor would have &s;een where his Error lay, in not rec|koning, that if at the &s;ame time that People have le&s;s Wages in <HI>Ireland</HI> they &s;pend much le&s;s, and &s;o can lay up more at the years end, then it would be Encourage|ment enough to invite People there, where they can get mo&s;t.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e who are in the Manufactury there, will
<PB N="16" REF="10">be forced to go to other Countries, &s;eems not likely, for the rea&s;on the Author him&s;elf gives el&s;ewhere, that they will turn to making of Cloth for their own wear|ing in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or if they do, there is no Country where they can find &s;o great Encouragement as to return to their Native Country.</P>
<P>The probability of their Wool going to <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> is before an&s;wered, and to prevent that, if this Act be not &s;trict enough, it is a good Foundation, and a &s;tricter may in time be made, and the Government there being &s;o much under the Direction and Influence of <HI>England,</HI> there is no doubt but the Laws will be ex|ecuted there as well as here, and I believe by degrees, the <HI>Rumny-Mar&s;h</HI> People will be weary of their Conni|vance.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al which the Author makes of doing the Work more gently by &s;ecret Di&s;couragements, &s;eems cruel and unju&s;t: Cruel, to ruin People under the pre|tence of &s;howing them Kindne&s;s, and unju&s;t to do it where there is no Publick and known Law to give them notice, whereby they may order their Affairs accord|ingly.</P>
