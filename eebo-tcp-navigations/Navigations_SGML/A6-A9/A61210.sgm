Feet can a Sub|ject of this Nature be &s;o fit|ly placed as at your Grace's,
You being &s;o experienc'd a Commander, and about to per|form <PB REF="3">&s;uch va&s;t important Acti|ons?</P>
<P>My Lord, it would but ar|gue me of the meane&s;t Imper|tinence to
pretend here an Ha|rangue of tho&s;e Encomiums you de&s;erve: For he who
acquaints the World who&s;e Son you are, has &s;aid enough to tho&s;e who do
not know you: Your Grace being the be&s;t Panegyrick upon your &s;elf: The Son
of the Great, the Immortal <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who&s;e &s;tupendious Actions,
and invin|cible Courage, together with his un&s;potted Zeal for the most

Blood inheres in you, where's the con&s;idering Man that que&s;tions Victory,

Notice of your Landing, He comes, 'tis <HI>Schomberg</HI>'s Son, why do we
defer to yield?</P>
<P>We read in Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory of the prodigious Actions of the
Mighty <HI>Talbot,</HI> who&s;e very Name at la&s;t was of &s;ufficient force
to defeat whole Armies: The Ca&s;e being parallel to the great Exploits of your
Renown|ed <PB REF="4">Father, of whom your Grace is a compleat Re&s;emblance,
how can it be, that we &s;hould fear a Victory?</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ent that I make bold to &s;end your Grace, is a

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE Geographical De&s;cription OF
FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Romans gave the Name of <HI>Gaul</HI> to that extent of Land,
which is between the <HI>Alpes</HI> and the <HI>Pyrenaeans,</HI> the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI>-Sea, the Ocean, and the <HI>Rhine:</HI> At pre&s;ent,
with an exception of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and &s;ome other Parts, which
do as it were depend upon the Empire of <HI>Ger|many;</HI> it is called
<HI>France,</HI> from the Name of the <HI>French,</HI> who made it &s;ub|ject 
<PB N="2" REF="7">to their Power. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> had fini&s;hed his
Conque&s;t of it about Forty Eight Years before the Nativity of Je|&s;us
Chri&s;t; in&s;omuch that when the French had ab&s;olutely e&s;tabli&s;hed
them|&s;elves therein, it had been near Five A|ges under the Laws of that
Empire.</P>
<P>Now without reckoning the Coun|try which the <HI>Gauls</HI> had
&s;ubdued be|yond the <HI>Alps,</HI> from the&s;e Mountains, as far as the
little River of <HI>Rubicon,</HI> and which was named <HI>Ci&s;alpine
Gaul,</HI> in re|&s;pect of the Romans: It was fir&s;t di|vided by
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> into Four Parts, <HI>Narbonoi&s;e Gaul,</HI> which they
called <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> becau&s;e they had &s;ubdued it fir&s;t, and reduced
it into a Province; <HI>Aqui|tanick Gaul, Gaul Celtick,</HI> and <HI>Gaul
Bel|gick.</HI> To the&s;e three la&s;t, they gave the Name of <HI>Gaul
Cheveliie,</HI> and when <HI>Gaul</HI> was ab&s;olutely &s;poken,
<HI>Celtick</HI> was under&s;tood. Then by Succe&s;&s;ion of time, and under
divers Emperors, it was divided again into Seventeen Pro|vinces, to wit, Five
<HI>Viennoi&s;es,</HI> in which number were computed the Fir&s;t and Second
<HI>Narbonoi&s;e;</HI> Three <HI>Aquitains;</HI> Five <HI>Lyonnoi&s;es,</HI>
comprehending the <HI>Se|quanoi&s;e;</HI> Four <HI>Belgick,</HI> Two of which
were called <HI>German,</HI> becau&s;e &s;ome People <PB N="3" REF="7">of
<HI>Germany</HI> had long &s;ince inhabited tho&s;e parts; and Two
<HI>Belgick,</HI> proper|ly &s;o called.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Provinces had its Me|tropolis; to wit, the Five
<HI>Viennoi&s;e, Vi|enna, Narbonne, Aix, Tarentai&s;e,</HI> and
<HI>Embrun;</HI> the Three <HI>Aquitains, Bourges, Bourdeaux</HI> and
<HI>Eaul&s;e;</HI> the Five <HI>Lyon|noi&s;es, Lyon, Rou&euml;n, Tours, Sens,
Be&s;ancon;</HI> The Two <HI>German, Mentz</HI> and <HI>Cologne;</HI> the Two
<HI>Belgick, Triers</HI> and <HI>Rheims.</HI></P>
<P>Under the&s;e Seventeen Metropoli|tans, there was above a Hundred
Cities or Towns, Heads of People, in which the Church has &s;ince con&s;tituted
Epi&s;|copal Sees. Under the&s;e Cities, there was a much greater number of
other Towns, which they called <HI>Oppida.</HI> When the Romans conquered
<HI>Gaul,</HI> there was no le&s;s computed than Twelve Hundred with Walls; but
they pulled down the Enclo&s;ures of the greate&s;t part, or let them fall to
ruin.</P>
<P>As to the Governments of the&s;e Se|venteen Provinces, Six of them
were Con&s;ular, and Eleven under Pre&s;idents, commi&s;&s;ioned by the
Emperor. <HI>Con|&s;tantine</HI> the Great, put Counts into the Cities, and
Dukes into &s;ome of the Frontier Towns; Judiciary matters <PB N="4" REF="8">were performed according to the Ro|man Law, but &s;ome Municipal
Cu&s;toms it's probable were kept up. They were not much di&s;turbed by the
Soldiery, becau&s;e the Legions lived with &s;ufficient order, and be&s;ides
there was hardly any but in the Adjacent Provinces. Yet as the Country was
agreeable and fertile, and the People extreamly &s;ubject, they were impo&s;ed
upon by all manner of Ex|actions, in&s;omuch that their Abundance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> encrea&s;ed their Mi&s;ery, and
their Obe|dience heigthned their Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the Year 330, when <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great divided the
Charge of <HI>Prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|du
Pretoire</HI> into Four, <HI>Gaul</HI> enjoyed one, who had under him Three
Vicars one in <HI>Gaul</HI> it &s;elf, one in <HI>Spain,</HI> and one in
<HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Fir&s;t who had this Charge, was the Father of St.
<HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> bearing the &s;ame Name as his Son. This Praefect u&s;ually
re&s;ided in the City of <HI>Triers,</HI> which for this rea|&s;on was the
Capital of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> till having been Four times &s;ack'd by the
Barbarians, the Emperor <HI>Honorius</HI> would transfer this Prerogative to
the City of <HI>Arles;</HI> which was at length taken off from <HI>Vienna,</HI>
and made up the Eigh|teenth Metropolis.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>From <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to <HI>Galien,</HI> the Peace of the&s;e
Provinces was di&s;turbed by. Two Revolts that of <HI>Sacrovir</HI> and
<HI>Flo|rus</HI> in the Twenty Third Year of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and that of
<HI>Civilis, Tutor &amp; Cla&s;&s;icus,</HI> which was much more dangerous in
the Year 70. After the Death of the Emperor <HI>Decius,</HI> the Barba|rians
began to torment them by frequent Incur&s;ions. For the Fir&s;t Hundred Years
there were none but French and Ger|mans that were concerned in them on this
&s;ide the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but afterwards the Misfortune was redoubled by the
hor|rible Deva&s;tations of Vandals, Bourguig|nons, Sueves, Vi&s;igoths and
Huns, which did not end but with the ruin of the Empire in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the Original of the French, the common opinion is, that they
are na|tural Germans, and that <HI>France</HI> is the name of a League, which
in their Lan|guage &s;ignified <HI>Free,</HI> or as others &s;ay, <HI>Fierce,
In&s;uperable.</HI> 'Tis certain that the Authors of the Third and Fourth Ages
by the name of <HI>German,</HI> almo&s;t always mean the <HI>French.</HI> As
for the time in which they began to appear, it was exactly Two Years after the
great Defeat of the Emperor <HI>Decius</HI> in <HI>Me&s;ia,</HI> 
<PB N="6" REF="9">which happened in the Year 254, by the Goths and other People
of <HI>Seythia,</HI> The Goths had begun to make them|&s;elves known but Twelve
Years before they went out of their own Country, which was <HI>European
Scythia,</HI> between the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea and the River <HI>Tanais,</HI>) to
ran&s;ack the Provinces of the Empire. They were divided into
<HI>O&s;trogoths</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;igoths;</HI> that is to &s;ay, according to,
&s;ome Ea&s;tern Goths and We&s;tern Goths.</P>
<P>After this Defeat, all the Fences of the Roman Empire being
ruinated on that &s;ide, there broke out Torrents of all &s;orts of Barbarians,
who had not been &s;o much as heard of till then. 'Tis for this rea&s;on
among&s;t others, and be|cau&s;e the French had al&s;o much of the Behaviors
and Cu&s;toms of the Scythians, (as to u&s;e Darts, to exerci&s;e Hawk|ing,
&amp;c.) that one is apt to conjecture that they are originally Scythians. But
it is not po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ible; and it
would be &s;uper uous to &s;ay of what Place, be|cau&s;e all the Scythians were
Vaga|bonds, and that in a little time they were found Two and Three Hundred
Leagues di&s;tance from the Country, which they inhabited a little before.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>The Fir&s;t time then that there is mention made of them, is in
the Year 256, under the Empire of <HI>Gallus</HI> and <HI>Vo|lu&s;ian,</HI>
when they pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine</HI> near <HI>Mentz;</HI> and when <HI>Aurelian</HI> who was
yet but Tribune of a Legion, killed Seven Hundred of them in an Encoun|ter, and
made Three Hundred Pri|&s;oners, who were &s;old at the publick Sale.</P>
<P>From this fir&s;t Irruption, to the time when they conquered or
be&s;ought of the Romans the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Lands in
<HI>Gaul,</HI> to wit, in the Countries of <HI>Cologne, Leige,</HI> and the
Neighbouring parts, there pa&s;&s;ed near 180 Years, which was in the Year 416.
There was lodged a Party in <HI>Brabant</HI> in the time of <HI>Julian</HI> the
Apo&s;tate, towards the Year 358; but it is not known, whe|ther they were
permitted to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Two Ages they conti|nued their Incur&s;ions with
divers Suc|ce&s;&s;es, always retiring with their Booty into <HI>Germany.</HI>
They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed there the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e Lands which are
be|tween the <HI>Mein</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>We&s;er</HI> and the
