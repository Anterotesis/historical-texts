<P>VPon Sunday la&s;t being the 25. of this in&s;tant June, a Dutch-man &s;truck into this Harbour, and the Ma&s;ter comming a&s;hore, imparted &s;e|verall things of great concernment touching this King|dome, carryed on by the Marquis of Newca&s;tle, the Lord <HI>German,</HI> and divers others; and among&s;t the re&s;t it was intimated, that there are divers Forces rai&s;ed in the Kingdom of France, and in the Provinces of
<PB N="2" REF="3">Holland, Zealand, and other places, mo&s;t of them being Engli&s;h, and that the Marque&s;&s;e of Newca&s;tle is ap|pointed Generall, and hath received Orders for their tran&s;portation into England.</P>
<P>He further intimated, that the Prince of Wales, and the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h Gallants hath taken their leave of the King of France, and are departed from the Court, with a re&s;olution to pa&s;&s;e from Callis to Dunkirk, &amp; &s;o with their new Army to Barwick in the North of England.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that before the Princes departure from Pa|ris in France, his Highne&s;&s;e went to the grates of &s;eve|rall Nunneries, and there gave the Nuns a vi&s;it, where they appeared unveiled; and in the pre&s;ence of &s;eve|rall Lords and Ladies of Honour, His Highne&s;&s;e de|clared, That for their many re&s;pects and favors vouch|&s;afed to Him, &s;ince His comming into that Countrey, he were much obliged to them, and thanked them for their great re&s;pects to his Mother, the Queen of Great Brittain, with many other civill expre&s;&s;ions; and ha|ving expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e, or the like words, took his leave, and departed.</P>
<P>Some report, that there are four Regiments rai&s;ed in Holland, to joyne with the afore&s;aid Army under the command of the Earl of Newca&s;tle, and to be tran&s;|ported over with them to joyn with Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> in the North.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, that when the forraign forces are u|nited and joyned, they will amount to betwixt four or five thou&s;and; which report cau&s;eth a great feare and jealou&s;ie among&s;t the Inhabitants in the&s;e parts, being
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;en&s;ible of the inhumane cruelty of Newca&s;tle and his Adherents, greatly fearing, that they &s;hall be left to the mercy of a forraign Enemy, if not timely prevent|ed by the great wi&s;dome and providence of the high and honourable Court of Parliament.</P>
<P>Wee al&s;o hear that the &s;even revolted &s;hips (which lately revolted from the obedience of Parliament) are gone into Helfer &s;luce in Holland, and another of the revolted &s;hips (called the Flying Buck &s;truck into Brill, who meeting with a Parliament &s;hip, boarded her, and turned out captain <HI>Nick&s;on,</HI> the captain thereof, and divers of the Mariners, and manned her with his own men; and the Captain of the Flying Bucke hath declared, That &s;uch &s;hips as he meets with that is not of his &s;ide, he will tye the men back to backe, and turne them into the Sea.</P>
<P>And about the 22. of this in&s;tant June, the Duke of York came from Zealand to Campheer, accompanied by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham</HI> and divers other Engli&s;h Gallants; from Campheer they came to a place called Goring, where &s;ome of the revolted &s;hips lay; and from thence he returned again to Campheer, with his Engli&s;h train.</P>
<P>We further hear, that the Duke is made High-Ad|mirall of the revolted Navy, and the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of Parham Vice-Admirall, and that if his Highne&s;&s;e can obtain from the Prince of Orange Money and Am|munition, they intend for England; for the Captain of the Flying Buck doth &s;peak as if they intended for Yar|mouth. It is likewi&s;e reported, that above 100. of the Engli&s;h Royali&s;ts are gone into the revolted &s;hips that ly at the Brill.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis morning a party of the Enemies &s;allyed forth at the South gate, and approached neer our hor&s;e Guard, but were quickly beaten back, and pur&s;ued by our party to the turn-pike, where they kept a Court of Guard, who upon our approach gave fire and fled away. So we entred this Guard, took &s;uch arms as were left there. This Guard of theirs was kept neer the Alme&s;-hou&s;es, at the entrance of the Sub|urbs of the town: in this action three of the enemy were killed, and many wounded. We al&s;o took 12. pri&s;o|ners, and 15 or 16 hor&s;e with arms, two hor&s;es of our were killed, and one man cut in the head, but the wound not mortall, nor any one of the re&s;t of our men recei|ving any hurt at all. Provi&s;ions begin to grow &s;carce in the town, e&s;pecially bread, &amp; how they are provided with corn I know not, but I am certain they are ill pro|vided of mills to grind it if they have any. For this day we have fired and burnt down their Wind-mils to the ground, divers &s;ouldiers &s;teal away from the enemy daily, and come into us, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Lord Ge|nerall &s;ent in a Letter, proferring conditions to &s;uch as &s;hould come to him, and unto all, if they would em|brace and yeeld up the town, which conditions were. 1. That within 24. hours after the receipt thereof, the officers laying down their armes, &s;hould have pa&s;&s;es to travell beyond Sea, &amp;c. 2. That the common &s;ouldi|ers, and all men of that rank, &s;hall have liberty to de|part to their own homes, &s;ubmitting to the authority of Parliament. 3. That the Inhabitants of the towne &s;hall be free from plunder and violence.</P>
<P>The&s;e conditions not being accepted of, the Lord Generall is re&s;olved not to offer &s;o good again to tho&s;e
<PB REF="4">which are the chief in action among&s;t the Enemy. Our army is in a very good condition and full of re&s;oluti|on, and although the Gen. is very unwilling to &s;torme the town (for that as much as in him is, he would a|void the &s;hedding of bloud.</P>
<P>Abot four of the clock this morning another party of the Enemies forces &s;allyed out of the towne vpon the Suffolk forces on the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide, but Col. <HI>Whaley</HI> joyning with them, charged them, killed two, &amp; put the re&s;t to a di&s;orderly retreat, took ten pri&s;oners, and &s;ome very good hor&s;es. This Evening another par|ty of the Enemy attempted to go out on Harwich road, to fetch in provi&s;ions, and were fallen upon by a par|ty of ours, which routed them and took divers pri&s;o|ners, one of which that was wounded &s;aith, that they begin to be exceedingly &s;traightned in the towne for provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially for hor&s;e meat: three of their Wind-mills are burnt downe, they have two Water+mils which we are cutting off, and have &s;caling Lad|ders ready to &s;torme, but the Morter piece is not yet come up.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning 3 troopers came out of the town with hor&s;e and arms, and proffer'd their &s;ervice to the General, they report there are in the town about 600. hor&s;e, and 3500. foot. and about 3 of the clock in the afternoon, Sir <HI>Charles Lucus</HI> drew out 8. companies of foot, and 4 troops of hor&s;e, clo&s;e under their Workes, whereupon a party of ours were commanded out to charge them, and after &s;ome exchange of &s;hot, our for|ces beat them in, &s;et their Guard hou&s;e on fire, killed two, and took &s;ome pri&s;oners.</P>
