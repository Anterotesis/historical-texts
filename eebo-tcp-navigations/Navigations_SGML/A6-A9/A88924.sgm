<P>Every <HI>Rea&s;onable</HI> man will readily allow, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t is a <HI>Duty</HI> to God, and a <HI>Service</HI> to the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">or to pre&s;erve, the <HI>Memory</HI> of &s;uch matters, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ave been the more <HI>Memorable Occurrences</HI> in the

This <HI>Expedition</HI> is u&s;ed in the publica|tion of our <HI>Decennium Luctuo&s;um,</HI> in hope that if any mi&s;take, worth Noting, do appear in <HI>the&s;e</HI> Writing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, it may, <HI>Like</HI> and perhaps <HI>With,</HI> a <HI>Second Edition,</HI> be <HI>Corrected and Amended.</HI></P>
<P>He Expects no <HI>Thanks</HI> for his E&s;&s;ayes to <HI>Do Good,</HI> in this way, or any other, unto any part of his Country, to whom he would gladly devote all his <HI>Talents,</HI> if he were a Thou&s;and Times bet|ter <HI>Talented</HI> than he is; and though the mo&s;t Ungrateful Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s Imaginable (which are too well known by the Name of <HI>Country-pay</HI>) &s;hould be given him, he would &s;till be of that Opinion, <HI>Recte feci&s;&s;e Merces est,</HI> If a man may <HI>Do Good,</HI> it is enough.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Favour</HI> he de&s;ires of you, is, That you would <HI>not Enquire after him;</HI> or ask, <HI>who he is?</HI> but that, as he is at be&s;t, but an <HI>Ob&s;cure</HI> Per&s;on, he may continue in yet more <HI>Ob&s;curity:</HI> which will be a greater plea&s;ure to him than to be
<PB N="5" REF="3"> placed among <HI>the Great men of Achaia.</HI></P>
<P>For indeed, He hath often thought on a pa&s;|&s;age written by Holy Mr. <HI>Row,</HI> to his Excellent Son, <HI>I pray, That God would make u&s;e of my &s;elf and you, in &s;uch a way, as that God only may be &s;een, and we not be taken notice of at all; that He may have the Glory, and we may not be &s;een.</HI></P>
<P>Could he have invited His EXCELLENCY unto &s;uch a glorious Table, as that in a certain Cabinet at <HI>Florence,</HI> which is furni&s;hed with Birds and Flow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, all con&s;i&s;ting of Nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly poli&s;hed <HI>Jewels</HI> it laid into it; a Work Fifteen years in making, and worth an Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns: or could he have written a Book, wor|thy to be laid up in the <HI>Cabinet</HI> of <HI>Darius:</HI> the Author might have been under a Temptation to have had his <HI>Name</HI> Engraved upon his <HI>Work.</HI> But a little Boild <HI>Indian Corn</HI> in a <HI>Tray,</HI> is as much as our Be&s;t Hi&s;tory of an <HI>Indian War,</HI> compos'd perhaps in fewer <HI>Dayes,</HI> than there were <HI>Years</HI> in the <HI>War,</HI> may pre&s;ume to be compar'd unto And &s;ince our Hi&s;tory will not afford &s;uch a Di+ver&s;ion unto <HI>His Excellency,</HI> under the Indi&s;po&s;iti|ons of His <HI>Health,</HI> as tho&s;e of <HI>Livy</HI> &amp; <HI>Curtius</HI> did unto the Princes that Recovered their lo&s;t <HI>Health</HI> by Reading them; nor can any any pa&s;&s;age here be &s;o happy, as <HI>That</HI> which cured <HI>Laurentius Me|dices</HI> of a Malady, by having it Read unto him it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l require no more than a <HI>Namele&s;s Writer,</HI> to A&s;&s;ure that Great Per&s;on on this Occa&s;ion,

<P>And the <HI>Naming</HI> of the Author, is as little Ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Qualify him, that he may pay publick Acknowledgments unto the Honorable, the <HI>Lieu|tenant Governour;</HI> not only for his Cares about the Publick, while it was <HI>Tempestuated,</HI> with the <HI>Indian War,</HI> which now makes an <HI>History;</HI> but chiefly for his more than ordinary Tenderne&s;s of that Society, which ha's been the very, <HI>Decus ac Tutamen,</HI> of <HI>New England.</HI> The <HI>Namele&s;s Writer</HI> of this Hi&s;tory, may Report, that with a Greater Expence, than that of the <HI>Fir&s;t-Founder,</HI> this Ho|norable Per&s;on proves, that he <HI>Loves our Nation,</HI> by <HI>Building</HI> us another <HI>Edifice,</HI> for the Supply of all our <HI>Synagogues,</HI> and STOUGHTON-HALL, out &s;hines HARVARD-COLLEDGE: and he &s;peaks <HI>Kinder Language,</HI> as well as <HI>Better Latin,</HI> than that Eminent States-man in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who&s;e An&s;wer to a Petition for the priviledges of an Univer&s;ity there to be re&s;tored, was, <HI>Non cura|mus vo&s;tros privilegios.</HI> This Report may he give, without being obliged for to Confe&s;s any other <HI>Name</HI> than this, which he Readily Confe&s;&s;es; <HI>One that was once a Member of</HI> Harvard-Colledge.</P>
<P>I pray, Sirs, Ask no further; Let this Writing be, like that on the Wall to <HI>Bel&s;hazzar,</HI> where the
<PB N="7" REF="4"> Hand only was to be &s;een, and not who's it was. The <HI>History</HI> is compiled with <HI>Incontestable Vera|city;</HI> and &s;ince there is no <HI>Ingenuity</HI> in it, but le&s;s than what many Pens in the Land might Com|mand, he knows not why his Writing <HI>Anonymou&s;ly</HI> may not Shelter him, from the Inconveniencies of having any Notice, one way or other, taken of him. Though among his other &s;mall Furni|ture, he hath not left him&s;elf unfurni&s;hed with skill in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language, yet he never could bring him&s;elf to the Belief of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb, <HI>Quien no parece, perece; i. e.</HI> He that appears not, peri&s;hes; He that Shows not him&s;elf to the world, is undone. At <HI>Milain,</HI> there is an <HI>Aca|demy</HI> of Sen&s;ible Per&s;ons, called The <HI>Na&s;co&s;ti,</HI> or, <HI>Hidden men;</HI> At <HI>Venice,</HI> there is one of &s;uch per&s;ons, called, The <HI>Incogniti;</HI> and at <HI>Parma,</HI> there is one of them, called, The <HI>Innominati.</HI> If there were nothing el&s;e Di&s;agreeable in them, the Author of this <HI>History,</HI> would be glad of an Admi&s;&s;ion into &s;uch an <HI>Academy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> is indeed of no very <HI>Fine Thred;</HI> and the Readers, who every where <HI>Fi&s;h for no|thing but Carps,</HI> and who Love, like <HI>Augustus</HI> to <HI>Tax all the World,</HI> may find Fault enough with it. Neverthele&s;s, while the <HI>Fault</HI> of an <HI>Untruth</HI> can't be found in it, the Author pretends, that the famous Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Trojan War</HI> it &s;elf, comes behind our little Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Indian War;</HI>

<P>And if a <HI>War</HI> between <HI>Us,</HI> and an Handful of <HI>Indians,</HI> do appear no more than a <HI>Batracho|myomachie,</HI> to the World <HI>abroad</HI> yet unto us <HI>at home,</HI> it hath been con&s;iderable-enough, to make an <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI> Nor is the Author afraid of promi|&s;ing, that of all the <HI>Thirty Articles</HI> which make up this <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> there &s;hall not be <HI>One,</HI> without <HI>&s;omething</HI> in it, that may by our &s;elves be ju&s;tly thought <HI>Con&s;iderable.</HI></P>
<P>Should any <HI>Petit Mon&s;ieur</HI> complain (as the Captain, that found not him&s;elf in the <HI>Tape&s;try Hangings,</HI> which Exhibited the Story of the Spani&s;h Inva&s;ion in 1588.) that he don't find him&s;elf mentioned in this <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> the Author has his Apology. He has done as <HI>well</HI> and as <HI>much</HI> as he could, that whatever was worthy of a mention, might have it; and if this Collecti|on of Matters be not compleat, yet he &s;uppo&s;es it may be more compleat, than any one el&s;e hath made; and now he hath done, he hath not pull'd up the <HI>Ladder</HI> after him; <HI>others</HI> may go on, as they plea&s;e, with a compleater Com|po&s;ure.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>If the Author hath taken Delight, in this <HI>Hi|&s;tory,</HI> and at all Times, to Celebrate the <HI>Merits,</HI> of &s;uch as have De&s;erved well of his Country, [which he has here done it may be, for &s;ome that never could afford <HI>him</HI> a good word!] E&s;pecially, if he do Erect <HI>Statues</HI> for <HI>Dead Wor|thies,</HI> when there is no Room Left for Flatte|ry, [for who will be&s;tow <HI>paint</HI> upon a <HI>Dead Face!</HI>] And if he do all this, with all po&s;&s;ible concern, to avoid ca&s;ting <HI>A&s;per&s;ions</HI> upon <HI>others:</HI> Why &s;hould any betray &s;uch <HI>Ili Nature,</HI> as to be angry at it? <HI>My Good Country, forgive him this Injury!</HI></P>

She was alwayes very Fearful of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but what Fear may we think now Surpri&s;ed her, when they fiercely bid her go into &s;uch a Chamber, and call the People out? Finding only a little Child in the Chamber, &s;he got into the Bed unto the Child, and hid her &s;elf in the Cloathes, as well as &s;he could. The Fell Salvages quickly pull'd her out, and made her Dre&s;s for a March, but led her a|way with no more than one Stockin upon her, a terrible March, through the Thick Woods, and a thou&s;and other Mi&s;eries, till they came to the <HI>Norway Plains.</HI> From thence they made her go to the end of <HI>Winnopi&s;&s;eag</HI> Lake, and from thence to the Ea&s;tward, through horrid Swamps, where &s;ometimes they mu&s;t Scramble over huge Trees

<P>A long and a &s;ad Journey &s;he had of it, thro' the mid&s;t of an hideous <HI>De&s;art,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a dreadful <HI>Winter:</HI> And who can enumerate the Frights, that &s;he endured, before the End of her Journey? Once her Ma&s;ter commanded her to loo&s;en &s;ome of her upper-Garments, and &s;tand again&s;t a Tree, while he charged his Gun; whereat the poor Child Shrieked out, <HI>He's going to kill me!</HI> God knows what he was going to do; but the Villian having charged his Gun, he call'd her from the Tree, and forbore doing her any Damage. Another Time, her Ma&s;ter or|dered her to run along the Shore with &s;ome In|dian Girls, while he paddled up the River in his Canoo. As they were upon a praecipice, a Tawny Wench violently pu&s;h'd her Head long into the River: But it &s;o fell out, that in that very place, the <HI>Bu&s;hes</HI> hung over the <HI>Water;</HI> &s;o that getting Hold of them, &s;he Recovered her &s;elf.

Now the young Indians began to Terrify her, with daily Intima|tions, <HI>That &s;he was quickly to be Roa&s;ted unto Death;</HI> and one Evening, much Fuel was prepared, be|tween Two Logs, which they told her, was for <HI>her.</HI> A mighty Fire being made, her Ma&s;ter call'd her to him, and told her, that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;ently be Burnt alive.

<P>At la&s;t, they arrived at <HI>Canada,</HI> and &s;he was carried unto the <HI>Lord Intendants</HI> Hou&s;e, where many Per&s;ons of Quality took much notice of her.

<P>While a Colony was forming it &s;elf at <HI>Canada,</HI> an Engli&s;h Fleet was Equipp'd, in the year, 1628. under the Command of Admiral <HI>Kirk,</HI> with a De&s;ign to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Country.

<P>Accordingly, on <HI>July</HI> 19. 1629. in the Morn|ing, the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet</HI> appear'd again, over again&s;t the Great Bay of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> at the point of the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans;</HI> which Fleet Con&s;i&s;ted of Three men of War, and Six other Ve&s;&s;els.

<PB N="65" REF="33"> they were thoroughly Advi&s;ed of what was a doing, and likely to be done, they did mole&s;t the Country with &s;ome Tragical Efforts of their Fury.

But about <HI>May</HI> 16 tho&s;e Hopes were over; For one <HI>Gre&s;&s;on,</HI> a Scotchman, then going out Early, &s;ell into the mouths of the&s;e Hungry Salvages.

<PB N="66" REF="34"> Di&s;covery, before they Salley'd forth.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE. XVI.</HI> The Memorable Action at <HI>Wells.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Ve&s;&s;el, the Name whereof I know not, [Reader, Let it be, <HI>The Charity,</HI>] being immediately di&s;patched unto <HI>Sagadehock,</HI> by the <HI>Charitable Compa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the more Southward Neighbours, with Effects to accompli&s;h it, hap|pily Effected the Redemption of many that were taken Captives at <HI>York.</HI> But the re&s;t of the Peo|ple in that Broken Town, talking of Drawing off, the Government &s;ent Captain <HI>Convers</HI> and Captain <HI>Greenleaf,</HI> with &s;uch Encouragements unto them, to keep their <HI>Station,</HI> as prevailed with 'em &s;till to <HI>Stand</HI> their Ground. In <HI>February</HI> Major <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> was made Commander in Chief, &amp; Forces under the Command of Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> Captain <HI>Floyd,</HI> and Captain <HI>Thaxter,</HI> were by him &s;o prudently po&s;ted, on the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> that by mentaining a continual Communication, it be|came a Difficult Thing for the Enemy to make any more Approaches. Lieutenant <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> parti|cularly hearing of a man Shot at, in <HI>Quochecho</HI>-Woods, went out with a Scout of about Eighteen men, who came upon the <HI>Indians</HI> that had &s;hot at the man; and killed and wounded <HI>all</HI> but <HI>one,</HI> of the whole Company. But now, <HI>Reader,</HI> the <HI>Longe&s;t Day</HI> in the <HI>Year</HI> is come on, and, it I
<PB N="88" REF="45"> mi&s;take not, the <HI>Bravest Act</HI> in the <HI>War,</HI> fell out upon it. <HI>Modockawando</HI> is now come, according to his Promi&s;e a Twelve Month ago. Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> was lodg'd in <HI>Storers</HI> Garri&s;on at <HI>Wells,</HI> with but Fifteen men; and there came into <HI>Wells,</HI> Two Sloops, with a Shallop, which had aboard Supplies of <HI>Ammunition</HI> for the Souldiers, and <HI>Contribution</HI> for the Needy. The <HI>Cattel</HI> this Day came <HI>Frighted,</HI> and <HI>Bleeding</HI> but of the Woods, which was a more certain <HI>Omen</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> a coming, than all the <HI>Prodigies</HI> that <HI>Livy</HI> reports of the <HI>Sacrificed Oxen. Convers</HI> immediately i&s;&s;ued out his Commands unto all Quarters, but e&s;peci|ally to the <HI>Sloops</HI> ju&s;t then arrived. The <HI>Sloops</HI> were Commanded by <HI>Samuel Storer,</HI> and <HI>James Gouge,</HI> and <HI>Gouges</HI> being Two miles up the <HI>River,</HI> he wi&s;ely brought her down undi&s;covered, unto <HI>Storers,</HI> by the advantage of a Mi&s;t then prevail|ing. A careful <HI>Night,</HI> they had on't! The next <HI>Morning,</HI> before <HI>Day-Light,</HI> one <HI>John Dia|mond,</HI> a Stranger that came in the Shallop on a Vi&s;it, came to Captain <HI>Conver's</HI> Garri&s;on, where the Watch invited him in; but he cho&s;e rather to go aboard the Sloops, which were little more than a Gun-&s;hot off; and, alas, the Enemy i&s;&s;u|ing out from their Lurking places, immediately Siez'd him, and haled him away by the Hair of the Head, (in &s;pite of all Attempts u&s;ed by the Garri&s;on, to Recover him) for an <HI>horrible Story,</HI> to be told by'nd by concerning him. The Gene|ral
<PB N="89" REF="45"> of the Enemies Army was Mon&s;ieur <HI>Burniff;</HI> and one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Labrocree</HI> was a principal Commander; (the Enemy &s;aid, he was Lieute|nant General:) There were al&s;o Diver&s;e other Frenchmen of Quality; Accompanied with <HI>Mo|dockawando,</HI> and <HI>Moxus,</HI> and <HI>Egeremet,</HI> and <HI>Warum|bo,</HI> and &s;everal more Indian Sagamores; The Army made up in all, about Five Hundred <HI>Men,</HI> or Fierce Things in the Shape of <HI>Men;</HI> all, to Encounter Fifteen <HI>Men,</HI> in one little <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> &amp; about Fifteen more <HI>Men,</HI> [worthily called <HI>Such!</HI>] in a Couple of open <HI>Sloops. Diamond</HI> having in|formed 'em, <HI>How t'was,</HI> in all points, (only that for <HI>Fifteen,</HI> by a mi&s;take he &s;aid, <HI>Thirty,</HI>) they fell to Dividing the Per&s;ons and Plunder, and A|greeing, that &s;uch an <HI>Engli&s;h Captain,</HI> &s;hould be Slave to &s;uch a one, and &s;uch a Gentleman in the Town &s;hould &s;erve &s;uch a one, and his <HI>Wife</HI> be a <HI>Maid of Honour,</HI> to &s;uch or &s;uch a <HI>Squaw</HI> propo&s;ed, and Mr. <HI>Wheelright</HI> (in&s;tead of being a Worthy Coun&s;ellor of the Province, which he <HI>Now</HI> is!) was to be the Servant of &s;uch a <HI>Netop;</HI> and the <HI>Sloops,</HI> with their <HI>Stores,</HI> to be &s;o and &s;o parted among them. There wanted but <HI>One Thing</HI> to Con&s;ummate the whole matter, even, the <HI>Chief Thing</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> all, which I &s;uppo&s;e they had not thought of; That was, For <HI>Heaven</HI> to Deli|ver all this prize into their Hands: But, <HI>Aliter Statutum e&s;t in Caelo!</HI> A man Habited, like a Gentleman, made a <HI>Speech</HI> to them in Engli&s;h;
<PB N="90" REF="46"> Exhorting 'em to Courage, and A&s;&s;uring 'em, that if they would Courageou&s;ly fall upon the Engli&s;h, all was their own. The <HI>Speech</HI> being Ended, they fell to the <HI>Work,</HI> and with an horrid Shout and Shot, made their A&s;&s;ault, upon the Feeble <HI>Garri&s;on:</HI> but the Engli&s;h an&s;wered with a brisk Volley, and &s;ent &s;uch a Leaden Showre among them, that they retired from the <HI>Garri|&s;on</HI> to &s;pend the Storm of their Fury upon the <HI>Sloops.</HI> You mu&s;t know, That <HI>Wells-Harbour</HI> is rather a <HI>Creek</HI> than a <HI>River,</HI> for 'tis very Nar|row, and at low water, in many places <HI>Dry:</HI> neverthele&s;s, where the Ve&s;&s;els ride, it is <HI>Deep</HI> enough, and &s;o far off the Bank, that there is from thence no Leaping aboard. But our <HI>Sloops</HI> were &s;orely incommoded, by a Turn of the <HI>Creek,</HI> where the Enemy could ly out of danger, &s;o near 'em, as to throw Mud aboard with their Hands. The Enemy was al&s;o privi|ledged with a Great Heap of <HI>Plank,</HI> lying on the Bank, and with an <HI>Hay Stock,</HI> which they Streng|thened with <HI>Posts,</HI> and <HI>Rayles;</HI> and from all the&s;e places, they poured in their Vengeance upon the poor <HI>Sloops,</HI> while they &s;o placed Smaller parties of their Salvages, as to make it impo&s;&s;ible for any of the Garri&s;ons, to afford 'em any relief. Lying thus, within a Dozen yards of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they did with their <HI>Fire Arrows,</HI> diver&s;e times de&s;perately &s;et the <HI>Sloops</HI> on Fire: but the brave Defendents, with a <HI>Swab,</HI> at the End of a <HI>Rope,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="46"> tyed unto a <HI>Pole,</HI> and &s;o dip't into the <HI>Water,</HI> happily put the Fire out. In brief the <HI>Sloops</HI> gave the Enemy &s;o brave a Repul&s;e, that at Night they Retreated: when they Renewed their A&s;&s;ault, finding that their <HI>Fortitude</HI> would not a&s;&s;ure the Succe&s;s of the A&s;&s;ault unto them, they had recour&s;e unto their <HI>Policy.</HI> Fir&s;t, an <HI>Indian</HI> comes on, with a <HI>Slab,</HI> for a <HI>Shield,</HI> before him; when a Shot from one of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> pierc|ed the <HI>Slab,</HI> which fell down, in&s;tead of a <HI>Tomb|&s;tone</HI> with the Dead <HI>Indian</HI> under it: on which, as little a Fellow as he was, I know not whe|ther &s;ome will not reckon it proper to in&s;cribe the <HI>Epitaph,</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> u&s;e to be&s;tow upon their <HI>Dead Popes; When the Dog is Dead, all his Malice is Dead with him.</HI> Their next <HI>Stra|tagem</HI> was This: They brought out of the Woods, a kind of a <HI>Cart,</HI> which they Trim'd, and Rigg'd, and Fitted up into a Thing, that might be called, <HI>A Chariot:</HI> whereon they built a platform, &s;hot|proof in the Front, and placed many men upon that platform. Such an Engine they under&s;tood how to Shape, without having Read, (I &s;uppo&s;e) the De&s;cription of the <HI>Pluteus</HI> in <HI>Vegetius!</HI> This <HI>Chariot</HI> they pu&s;h'd on, towards the <HI>Sloops,</HI> till they were got, it may be, within <HI>Fifteen yards</HI> of them; when, lo, one of the <HI>Wheels</HI> to their Admiration Sunk into the Ground. A <HI>French|man</HI> Stepping to heave the <HI>Wheel,</HI> with an Help|ful Shoulder, <HI>Storer</HI> Shot <HI>him</HI> down; Another
<PB N="92" REF="47"> Stepping to the <HI>Wheel, Storer</HI> with a well placed Shot, &s;ent <HI>him</HI> after his <HI>Mate:</HI> So the Re&s;t thought, it was be&s;t let it &s;tand as it was. The Enemy kept Galling the <HI>Sloops,</HI> from their Several Batte|ries, and calling 'em to Surrender, with many fine promi&s;es to make them <HI>Happy,</HI> which ours an&s;wered with a ju&s;t <HI>Laughter,</HI> that had now and then a mortiferous <HI>Bullet</HI> at the End of it. The Tide Ri&s;ing, the <HI>Chariot</HI> over&s;et, &s;o that the men behind it lay open to the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which im|mediately Di&s;pen&s;ed an horrible Slaughter among them; and they that could get away, got as fa&s;t, and as far off, as they could. In the Night, the Enemy had much Di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>Sloops;</HI> they Enquired, <HI>Who were their Commanders?</HI> and the Engli&s;h gave an An&s;wer, which in &s;ome other Ca&s;es, and Places, would have been too true, <HI>That they had a great many Commanders:</HI> but the Indians Replyed, <HI>You ly, you have none but</HI> Convers, <HI>and we will have him too before Morning!</HI> They al&s;o knowing, that the <HI>Magazine</HI> was in the <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> lay under an Hill-Side, Pelting at <HI>That,</HI> by Times; but Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> once in the Night, &s;ent out Three or Four of his men, into a Field of Wheat, for a <HI>Shot,</HI> if they could get one. <HI>There</HI> &s;eeing a <HI>Black Heap</HI> lying together, Ours all at once let Fly upon them, a <HI>Shot,</HI> that Slew &s;everal of them that were thus <HI>Caught in that Corn,</HI> and made the re&s;t glad, that they found them&s;elves Able to Run for it. Captain <HI>Convers</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="47"> was this while in much Di&s;tre&s;s, about a <HI>Scout</HI> of Six men, which he had &s;ent forth to <HI>Newicha|wannick,</HI> the Morning before the Arrival of the Enemy, ordering them to <HI>Return</HI> the Day follow|ing. The Scout <HI>Return'd,</HI> into the very Mouth of the Enemy, that lay before the Garri&s;on; but the <HI>Corporal,</HI> having his Wits about him, call'd out aloud, (as if he had &s;een Captain <HI>Convers</HI> making a Salley forth upon 'em,) <HI>Captain, Wheel about your men round the Hill, and we &s;hall Catch 'em, there are but a Few Rogues of 'em!</HI> Upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> imagining, that Captain <HI>Con|vers</HI> had been at their <HI>Heels,</HI> betook them&s;elves to their <HI>Heels;</HI> and our Folks got &s;afe into ano|ther Garri&s;on. On the <HI>Lords Day</HI> Morning, there was for a while, a Deep Silence among the A&s;|&s;ailants; but at length getting into a Body, they marched with great Formality towards the <HI>Gar|ri&s;on,</HI> where the Captain ordered his Handful of men to ly Snug, and not make a <HI>Shot,</HI> until every <HI>Shot</HI> might be likely to do &s;ome Execution. While they thus beheld a Formidable Crue of <HI>Dragons,</HI> coming with open mouth upon them, to Swallow them up at a Mouthful, one of the Souldiers began to &s;peak of <HI>Surrendring;</HI> upon which the Captain Vehemently prote&s;ted, <HI>That he would lay the man Dead, who &s;hould &s;o much as mutter that ba&s;e word any more!</HI> and &s;o they heard no more on't: But the Valiant <HI>Storer</HI> was put upon the like prote&s;tation, to keep 'em in good
<PB N="94" REF="48"> Fighting trim, aboard the <HI>Sloops</HI> al&s;o. The E|nemy now Approaching very near, gave Three Shouts, that made the Earth ring again; and Crying out, in Engli&s;h, <HI>Fire, and Fall on, Brave Boyes!</HI> the whole Body, drawn into Three Ranks, Fired at once. Captain <HI>Convers</HI> immediately ran into the &s;everal Flankers, and made their Be&s;t Guns Fire at &s;uch a rate, that &s;everal of the E|nemy fell, and the re&s;t of 'em di&s;appeared almo&s;t as Nimbly, as if they had been &s;o many <HI>Spectres.</HI> Particularly, a parcel of them got into a &s;mall De&s;erted Hou&s;e; which having but a Board-Wall to it, the Captain &s;ent in after them, tho&s;e <HI>Bullets</HI> of Twelve to the Pound, that made the Hou&s;e too hot, for them that could get out of it. The <HI>Women</HI> in the Garri&s;on, on this occa&s;ion took up the <HI>Amazonian</HI> Stroke, and not only brought Ammunition to the <HI>Men,</HI> but al&s;o with a <HI>Manly</HI> Re&s;olution fired &s;everal Times upon the Enemy. The Enemy finding that Things would not yet go to their minds, at the <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> drew off, to Try their Skill upon the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which lay &s;till abre&s;t in the Creek, la&s;h'd fa&s;t one to another. They built a Great <HI>Fire Work,</HI> about Eighteen or Twenty Foot Square, and fill'd it up with Com|bu&s;tible matter, which they Fired; and then they &s;et it in the way, for the <HI>Tide</HI> now to Flote it up, unto the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which had now nothing but an horrible <HI>Death</HI> before them. Neverthe|le&s;s, their Demands, of both the <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="48"> the <HI>Sloops,</HI> to yield them&s;elves, were an&s;wered no otherwi&s;e than with <HI>Death</HI> upon many of them, Spit from the Guns of the Be&s;eiged. Having tow'd their <HI>Fire-Work,</HI> as far as they dur&s;t, they committed it unto the <HI>Tide;</HI> but the Di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Chri&s;tians that had this Deadly <HI>Fire,</HI> Swim|ming along upon the <HI>Water</HI> towards 'em, com|mitted it unto <HI>God:</HI> and <HI>God</HI> looked from Hea|ven upon them, in this prodigious Article of their Di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>The&s;e poor men Cryed, and the Lord, heard them, and &s;aved them out of their Troubles;</HI> The <HI>Wind,</HI> unto their A&s;toni&s;hment, immediately Turn'd about, and with a Fre&s;h Gale drove the <HI>Machin</HI> a&s;hore on the other &s;ide, and Split it &s;o, that the <HI>Water</HI> being let in upon it, the <HI>Fire</HI> went out. So, the Godly men, that Saw God from Heaven thus Fighting for them, Cryed out, with an A&s;toni&s;hing Joy, <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our Side, they had Swallowed us up quick; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their Teeth; our Soul is E&s;caped, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers!</HI> The Enemy were now in a pittiful pickle, with Toyling, and Moyling in the <HI>Mud,</HI> &amp; black'ned with it, if <HI>Mud</HI> could add <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> to &s;uch Mi&s;creants: and their Ammunition was pretty well Exhau&s;ted: So that now they began to Draw off, in all parts, and with Rafts get over the River; &s;ome whereof breaking, there did not a few <HI>Cool</HI> their late <HI>Heat</HI> by falling into it. But fir&s;t, they made
<PB N="96" REF="49"> all the Spoil they could, upon the <HI>Cattel</HI> about the Town; and giving one Shot more at the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they kill'd the only <HI>Man,</HI> of ours, that was kill'd aboard 'em. Then, after about Half an Hours Con&s;ultation, they &s;end a <HI>Flag of Truce</HI> to the Garri&s;on, advi&s;ing 'em with much Flatte|ry, to <HI>Surrender;</HI> but the Captain &s;ent 'em word, <HI>That he wanted for nothing, but for men to come, and Fight him.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> replyed unto Captain <HI>Convers, Being you are &s;o Stout, why don't you come, and Fight in the open Field, like a Man, and not Fight in a Garri&s;on, like a Squaw?</HI> The Cap|tain rejoyned; <HI>What a Fool, are you? Do you think, Thirty men a Match for Five Hundred? No,</HI> (&s;ayes the Captain, counting as well he might, each of his <HI>Fifteen</HI> men, to be as Good as <HI>Two!) Come with your Thirty men upon the Plain, and I'le meet you with my Thirty, as &s;oon as you will.</HI> Upon this, the <HI>Indian</HI> an&s;wered; <HI>Nay, mee own, Engli&s;h Fa&s;hi|on is all one Fool; you kill mee, mee kill you! No, better ly &s;ome where, and Shoot a man, and hee no &s;ee! That the be&s;t Souldier!</HI> Then they fell to Coak&s;ing the Captain, with as many <HI>Fine Words,</HI> as the <HI>Fox</HI> in the Fable had for the Allurement of his Prey unto him; and urged mightily that En&s;ign <HI>Hill,</HI> who &s;tood with the <HI>Flag of Truce,</HI> might &s;tand a little nearer their Army. The Captain, for a Good Rea&s;on, to be pre&s;ently di&s;|cerned, would not allow <HI>That:</HI> whereupon they fell to Threatning, and Raging, like &s;o many
<PB N="97" REF="49"> Defeated Devils, u&s;ing the&s;e Words, <HI>Damn ye, we'll cut you as &s;mall as Tobacco, before to morrow Morning.</HI> The Captain, bid 'em to make Ha&s;t, for, <HI>he wanted work;</HI> So, the Indian throwing his Flag on the Ground, ran away, and En&s;ign <HI>Hill</HI> nimbly Stripping his Flag ran into the <HI>Valley,</HI> but the Salvages pre&s;ently Fired, from an Ambu&s;h|ment behind an <HI>Hill,</HI> near the place, where they had urged for a <HI>Parley.</HI></P>
<P>And now for poor <HI>John Diamond!</HI> The Ene|my Retreating (which opportunity the <HI>Sloops</HI> took, to Burn down the Dangerous <HI>Hay-Stock,</HI>) into the plain, out of Gun-&s;hot, they fell to Tor|turing their Captive <HI>John Diamond,</HI> after a man|ner very Diabolical. They <HI>Stripped</HI> him, they <HI>Scalped</HI> him alive, and after a <HI>Castration,</HI> they Fini&s;hed that Article in the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Trai|tors</HI> upon him; They Slit him with <HI>Knives,</HI> be|tween his <HI>Fingers</HI> and his <HI>Toes;</HI> They made cruel <HI>Ga&s;hes</HI> in the mo&s;t Fle&s;hy parts of his Body, and &s;tuck the Ga&s;hes with <HI>Fire-brands,</HI> which were afterwards found Sticking in the wounds. Thus they Butchered <HI>One</HI> poor Engli&s;hman, with all the <HI>Fury</HI> that they would have &s;pent upon them <HI>all;</HI> and performed an Exploit, for Five Hun|dred <HI>Furies</HI> to brag of, at their coming home. Gha&s;tly to <HI>Expre&s;s!</HI> what was it then to <HI>Suffer?</HI> They Returned then unto the <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> and kept Firing at it now and then, till near Ten a Clock at Night; when they all marched off, leaving

Several per&s;ons Remarkably E&s;caped this Bloody Deluge, but none, with more Bravery, than one <HI>Thomas Bickford,</HI> who had an Hou&s;e, a Little Palli&s;ado'd, by the River Side; but no man in it be&s;ides him&s;elf.

<PB N="122" REF="62"> They fir&s;t would have per&s;waded him, with many fair <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> and then, terrified him with as many Fierce <HI>Threatnings,</HI> to yield him&s;elf; but he flouted and fired at them, daring 'em, to come if they dur&s;t.

The Indians Then Kill'd this Gentlewoman, and Three other People, a little before they had Fini&s;hed a point of Husbandry, then in their Hand.

Ne|verthele&s;s, in other parts of that Plantation, (when the Good People had been &s;o tired out, as to lay down their <HI>Military Watch,</HI>) there were more than Twenty per&s;ons killed, and more than a Dozen carried away.

<P>Behold, Reader, the Troubles, and the Trou|blers of <HI>New-England!</HI> That thou may&s;t a little more Exactly Behold the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the matter, I'l Recite certain pa&s;&s;ages, occurring in a Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;s'd between this <HI>Bomma&s;een</HI> (who was one of the <HI>Indian Princes,</HI> or, <HI>Chieftanes,</HI>) and a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, in the year. 1696.</P>
<P><HI>Bomma&s;een,</HI> was, with &s;ome other Indians, now a Pri&s;oner, in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> He de&s;ired a Confe|rence with a Mini&s;ter, of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which was granted him. <HI>Bomma&s;een,</HI> with the other <HI>Indians</HI> a&s;&s;enting and a&s;&s;erting to it, then told the Mini&s;ter, That he pray'd his In|&s;truction in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> ina&s;much as he was afraid, that the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,</HI> which they taught the <HI>Indians,</HI> had Abu&s;ed them. The Mini&s;ter Enquired of him, What of the Things taught 'em by the <HI>French,</HI> appear'd mo&s;t Su&s;picious to 'em? He &s;aid, The <HI>French</HI> taught 'em, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST, was of the <HI>French Nation;</HI> That His Mother, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was a <HI>French Lady;</HI> That they were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had Murdered him; and,
<PB N="128" REF="65"> That whereas He Ro&s;e from the Dead, &amp; went up to the Heavens, all that would Recommend them&s;elves unto His Favour, mu&s;t Revenge His Quarrel upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as far as they can. He ask'd the Mini&s;ter, whether the&s;e Things were &s;o; and pray'd the Mini&s;ter to In&s;truct him in the True <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> The Mini|&s;ter con&s;idering, that the Humour and Manner of the <HI>Indians,</HI> was to have their Di&s;cour&s;es ma|naged, with much of <HI>Similitude</HI> in them, Look'd about for &s;ome Agreeable object, from whence he might with apt <HI>Re&s;emblances</HI> Convey the <HI>Idae's</HI> of Truth unto the minds of Salvages: and he thought, none would be more Agreeable to <HI>them,</HI> than a <HI>Tankard of Drink,</HI> which happened then to be &s;tanding on the Table. So he pro|ceeded in this <HI>Method</HI> with 'em.</P>
<P>He told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, [&s;till with proper Actions painting, and pointing out the <HI>Signs</HI> unto them,] That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, had given us, a <HI>Good Religion,</HI> which might be Re&s;embled unto the <HI>Good Drink in the Cup,</HI> upon the Table.</P>
<P>That if we Take this <HI>Good Religion,</HI> (even that <HI>Good Drink,</HI>) into our Hearts, it will do us <HI>Good,</HI> and pre&s;erve us from <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>That Gods <HI>Book,</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> is the <HI>Cup,</HI> wherein that <HI>Good Drink,</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> is offered unto us.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French,</HI> having the <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Good Drink,</HI> in their Hands, had put <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> into it; and then made the <HI>Indians</HI> to Drink that <HI>Poi&s;oned Liquor,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="65"> whereupon, they Run mad, and fell to killing of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> though they could not but know, it mu&s;t unavoidably i&s;&s;ue in their own De&s;truction at the La&s;t.</P>
<P>That, it was plain, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had put no <HI>Poi|&s;on,</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink;</HI> for they &s;et the <HI>Cup</HI> wide open, and invited all men, to <HI>Come</HI> &amp; <HI>See</HI> before they <HI>Ta&s;t;</HI> even, the very <HI>Indians</HI> them|&s;elves; for we Tran&s;lated the <HI>Bible</HI> into <HI>Indian.</HI> That they might gather from hence, that the <HI>French</HI> had put <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink;</HI> ina&s;|much, as the <HI>French</HI> kept the <HI>Cup</HI> fa&s;t Shut, (the Bible in an <HI>Unknown Tongue,</HI>) and kept their <HI>Hands</HI> upon the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they put it unto their mouths.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be well-Satisfied, with what the Mini&s;ter had hitherto &s;aid, pray'd him, to go on, with &s;howing 'em, what was the <HI>Good Drink,</HI> and what was the <HI>Poi|&s;on,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had put into it.</P>
<P>He then &s;et before them di&s;tinctly the chief <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> with all the Sim|plicity and Sincerity of a <HI>Protestant:</HI> Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Good Drink, in the Lords Cup of Life:</HI> And they &s;till profe&s;&s;ed, <HI>That they liked it all.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, he demon&s;trated unto them, how the <HI>Papists</HI> had in their Idolatrous <HI>Popery,</HI> &s;ome way or other Depraved, and Altered, every one of the&s;e <HI>Articles;</HI> with Scandalous <HI>Ingredients</HI> of
<PB N="130" REF="66"> their own Invention; Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Poi&s;on which the French have put into the Cup.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t, he mentioned this Article.</P>
<P><HI>To obtain the Pardon of your Sins, you must con|fe&s;s your Sins to God; &amp; pray to God, That He would Pardon your Sins, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who dyed for the Sins of His People: God Loves Je&s;us Chri&s;t infinitely, and if you place your Eye on Je&s;us Christ only, when you beg the Pardon of your Sins, God will Pardon them. You need confe&s;s your Sins to none but God, Except in ca&s;es, where men have known your Sins, or have been Hurt by your Sins; &amp; then tho&s;e men &s;hould know that you confe&s;s your Sins; but after all, none but God can Pardon them.</HI></P>
<P>He then added; <HI>The French have put Poi&s;on in|to this Good Drink; They tell you, that you mu&s;t confe&s;s your Sins to a Prie&s;t, and carry skins to a Prie&s;t, and Submit unto a Penance enjoyned by a Prie&s;t; and this Prie&s;t is to give you a Pardon. There is no need of all This: 'Tis nothing but French Poi&s;on, all of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Wretches appearing a&s;toni&s;h'd, to meet with one who would &s;o fairly put them into a glorious way to obtain the <HI>Pardon of their Sins,</HI> and yet take no <HI>Bever Skins</HI> for it: in a Rap|ture of A&s;toni&s;hment, they fell down on their <HI>knees,</HI> and got his <HI>Hand</HI> into theirs, and fell to ki&s;&s;ing of it with an Extream &s;how of Affection.</P>
<P>He &s;haking them off, with di&s;like of their po&s;ture, <HI>Bomma&s;een</HI> with the re&s;t of them &s;tood

<PB N="136" REF="69"> Scalpt for Dead, and no doubt the Salvages upon producing her <HI>Scalp,</HI> received the <HI>Price of her Death,</HI> from tho&s;e that hired them, and yet &s;he &s;o Recovered, as to be &s;till <HI>Alive.</HI> Moreover, on <HI>July</HI> 26. the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> the People at <HI>Quoche|cho,</HI> returning from the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>Three</HI> of them were killed, <HI>Three</HI> of them were wounded, and <HI>Three</HI> of them were carried away Pri&s;oners to <HI>Penob&s;cut;</HI> which la&s;t <HI>Three,</HI> were neverthele&s;s in le&s;s than Three weeks returned.

<P>FOr the pre&s;ent then, we have done with the <HI>Indians:</HI> But while the <HI>Indians</HI> have been thus mole&s;ting us, we have &s;uffered Mole&s;tati|ons of another &s;ort, from another &s;ort of Ene|mies, which may with very good Rea&s;on, be ca&s;t into the &s;ame <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> with them.

<P>In the mean Time, I owe unto the Publick, a piece of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> which it may be for the Safe|ty of our <HI>Northern Towns,</HI> to be acquainted with|al.

<PB N="165" REF="83"> Quakeri&s;m,</HI> while he really differed from them. All this while, <HI>George Keith</HI> was admired by our <HI>Quakers,</HI> as an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> or, an <HI>Oracle:</HI> but, he finding it impo&s;&s;ible to mentain the gro&s;s Tenets of the common <HI>Quakers,</HI> preach'd unto them the Nece&s;&s;ity of Believing on a <HI>Chri&s;t without,</HI> as well as a <HI>Chri&s;t within.</HI> Hereupon, there grew &s;uch alienations between him, and the other <HI>Quakers,</HI> (who had been taught by <HI>George Fox,</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>The Devil is in them, who &s;ay, they are Saved by Christ without them:</HI>) that he not only ha's written diver&s;e Learned Books, to confute tho&s;e very Doctrines of the Common <HI>Quakers,</HI> which the Pa&s;tors of <HI>New-England</HI> had, upon his Pro|vocation, Written again&s;t, but al&s;o ha's therefore undergone a Storm of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> from the Friends in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania:</HI> Yea, 'tis verily thought, that poor <HI>George</HI> would have been made a Sacri|fice to Squire <HI>Samael Jennings,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Pen&s;ylvanian Dragons,</HI> and that, &s;ince a crime which their Laws ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> made <HI>Capital,</HI> was men|tion'd in the <HI>Mittimus</HI> whereby <HI>Keith</HI> was com|mitted, they would have Hang'd him, if a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|volution</HI> upon their Government had not &s;et him at liberty. Being by the Fines, and Gaols, and Fierce U&s;ages of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> dri+ven over to <HI>England,</HI> the Wonderful Hand of God, hath made this very man, I think I may &s;ay, incomparably the greate&s;t <HI>Plague,</HI> that ever came upon that Sect, of <HI>Energumens.</HI> Although

<P>All that I would pre&s;ume now to Commend unto tho&s;e <HI>Towns,</HI> which have &s;uch <HI>Quakers</HI> an|noying of them, is This <HI>Brethren,</HI> carry it <HI>well,</HI> even with all convenient <HI>Civility</HI> &amp; <HI>Humanity,</HI> towards this Poor Deluded People; while you Charge your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> that they do not go unto their <HI>Meetings:</HI> and ca&s;t not your &s;elves al&s;o into <HI>Temptation,</HI> by needle&s;sly being <HI>There.</HI> But after all, yea, <HI>before all,</HI> make an Experi|ment, which the Good People at <HI>Lyn</HI> made a little while ago, with a Succe&s;s truly ob&s;ervable and memorable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> made a more than ordinary De|&s;cent upon the Town of <HI>Lyn,</HI> and <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> &s;uddenly &s;pread there, at &s;uch a rate as to A|larum the Neighbourhood.

<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> are &s;uch Enemies, to the Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> which is the Life of <HI>New England,</HI> That you mu&s;t Excu&s;e my concern to have you For|tify'd again&s;t <HI>their</HI> Attempts al&s;o, while I am giving you an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of your <HI>other Enemies.</HI> What <HI>all</HI> of them would be at, methinks, was a little intimated by what <HI>One</HI> of them once De|clared. The <HI>Globe Tavern</HI> was near our Publick and Spacious <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Salem:</HI> and a No|ted <HI>Quaker</HI> there cau&s;ed a paper to be &s;et up on the Door of that Meeting-Hou&s;e, which had &s;uch Stuff as this written in it.</P>
<Q><L>Beware, Beware, and Enter not:</L>
<L>But rather to the Globe, and &s;pend a Pot.</L></Q>
<P>This is but like a pa&s;&s;age mentioned in the Life, of that Excellent man Mr. P. <HI>Henry,</HI> lately publi&s;hed. A Debauched Gentleman, in his Re|vels, Drinking and Swearing, at <HI>Malpas,</HI> was Re|proved by a Quaker, then in his Company. Why, &s;aid the Gentleman, I'le ask thee one Que&s;tion; Whether it is better for me to follow Drinking and Swearing, or to go and Hear <HI>Henry?</HI> The Quaker an&s;wered; <HI>Nay, of the Two, rather follow thy Drinking and Swearing.</HI> Behold, the Spirit of <HI>Quakeri&s;m!</HI> When I once compelled a <HI>Quaker</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="93"> to confe&s;s, that the Body of Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth</HI> ro&s;e from the Grave, and went up into the Hea|vens, he begg'd me that I would not improve his confe&s;&s;ion, as if made on the behalf of all his Friends. And another of them, as, I hear, pub|lickly <HI>Held Forth</HI> by one of his late <HI>Stercorations,</HI> That the <HI>Husks</HI> of the <HI>Swine,</HI> on which the <HI>Pro|digal</HI> fed in the <HI>Parable,</HI> were, The <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> in that which People call, <HI>The Sacrament.</HI></P>

<P>Secondly.

<P>WHen the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were Engaged in a WAR, they made choice of a <HI>Priest</HI> among them, to Serve &s;ome of their greate&s;t Occa&s;ions in it, and after a <HI>Sacred Unction</HI> be&s;tow'd upon him, we are told by <HI>Maimonides,</HI> he was call'd <HI>Ma&s;huach Milchamah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Unctus Belli;</HI> which was as much as to &s;ay, <HI>The Prie&s;t of the War.</HI></P>
<P>To bring unto a People profitable Advices &amp; Reflections upon a WAR, wherein they are En|gaged, and &s;ound the <HI>Silver Trumpet,</HI> of the Go&s;|pel, with agreeable Notes unto them in it, is to do in &s;ome &s;ort, the Office of the <HI>Ma&s;huach Mil|chamah;</HI> and this Office the En&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e pre&s;umes to do, with Endeavours that the Voice of Heaven by the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of our late <HI>War,</HI> may he heard giving a <HI>certain Sound,</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Echo's</HI> of it.</P>
