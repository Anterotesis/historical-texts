<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is not needfull to &s;ay much concerning the late agreement betwixt His Sacred Maje&s;ty <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Great Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. and the City and Kingdom of <HI>Al|gier;</HI> (the Articles whereof are in the&s;e follow|ing Papers, word for word exhibited) For certain|ly, that man is very little read in the world, who &s;ees not how much this Peace imports the benefit and &s;ecurity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce, and no le&s;s the honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the &s;tart it has given us of our powerfull Neighbours, who are &s;till labouring under great trouble, charge and difficulty with tho&s;e people: and the Accord is yet more glorious, if we ob&s;erve the time wherein it was made; that is to &s;ay, it was made at a time when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay patiently expo&s;ed to all the inconveniences, which ei|ther the Fables or the Councils of <HI>Holland</HI> could give them; menaced in the very Channel by an open Force, and de&s;erted in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> after &s;uch a manner, that we are loth to make u&s;e of a word, an&s;werable to the quality of the action: the Hollanders having fir&s;t invited us into a conjunct engagement with them, and afterward not only quitting the place by &s;tealth and &s;urprize, but invading at the &s;ame time our Rights in <HI>Guine:</HI> And yet &s;o it is at la&s;t, that notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e practi&s;es and di&s;appointments, we have now liv'd to &s;ee the Hollanders &s;wallow their own re&s;olutions, by with-drawing their Shipping, and contenting them&s;elves with the blind Pa&s;&s;age of the North, rather then adventuring to give his Royal Highne&s;s the Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> the un-mannerly provocation of pre&s;|&s;ing through the Channel. And we ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> likewi&s;e liv'd to injoy the Fruits of that Peace, which others have in vain attempted; and not only &s;o, but to fee our &s;elves acquitted of the guilt of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> by a &s;olemn Declara|tion of the Government it &s;elf of <HI>Algier,</HI> and the breath charg'd upon the tumults and di&s;orders of their own Subjects: they them&s;elves not &s;ticking publickly to avow, that an agreement with <HI>England</HI> was to them &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, that they were not able to maintain an entercour&s;e and corre&s;pondence without it.</P>
<P>This being the &s;um and &s;tate of that Affair, gives &s;ufficiently to under|&s;tand, how great a care His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> hath of the reputation and welfare of His people, and of the true intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown and Nation. And it is our further happine&s;s, that the Orders and Directions of &s;o wi&s;e and gracious a Prince, are committed into the hands of &s;uitable Officers and Mini&s;ters, as hath been manife&s;ted throughout the whole cour&s;e and con|duct of this Tran&s;action.</P>
