<HEAD><HI>A BRIEF</HI> Relation of the Siege of <HI>VIENNA,</HI> And the Victory of the CHRISTIANS again&s;t the T&V;RKS at BARKAN.</HEAD>
<P>THe Turks falling with their formidable Forces like a Torrent into Hungary, the Duke of Lorrain was forced to repa&s;s the River Raab, and fir&s;t to bring his Army under the Walls of Altenbourg, and afterwards to cau&s;e his Infantry to pa&s;s one of the Arms of the Danube, and to po&s;t them&s;elves in the I&s;land Schutz, while his Highne&s;s remained with his Cavalry on this &s;ide the River, but he was quickly obliged to retire, upon the advice he had, that the Hungarians, who were appointed to guard the pa&s;&s;age of the River Raab, had be|trayed the &s;ame to the Enemy. His Highne&s;s marched with all the &s;peed he could, but the Enemy followed him &s;o clo&s;e; that their foremo&s;t Troops fell upon his Rear; the &s;kirmi&s;h was very hot, and the Imperiali&s;ts &s;uffered a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;iderable lo&s;s: but in conclu&s;ion the Enemy were forced to retire; In this action the Prince of Savoy was mortally wounded. On the 8th of July the Duke of Lorrain arrived near this place with the Imperial Cavalry; and about nine a clock that night, their Imperial Maje&s;ties, with the Arch-Dukes, and Arch-dutche&s;&s;es parted from hence in great ha&s;te for Lintz. The next day and the following great numbers of people left this place, &s;ome one way, &s;ome another; and the confu&s;ion and con&s;ternation we were here in, cannot be expre&s;t. The Enemy in the mean time advanced into Au&s;tria, the Tartars making a mo&s;t terrible ravage wherever they came; Our Governor the Count de Staremberg, who arrived here from the Army on the Eighth, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Count de Caplieres, in quality of the Emperors Commi&s;&s;ary General, was not wanting all this while, as well as thetime would permit, to put the place into a po&s;ture of defence, and particularly to plant Pali&s;adoes on the Counter&s;charp. The 11th and 12th the Imperial Infantry making Six Regiments, entred the place, and then our Gari&s;on, with the Regiment of Staremberg of 1500 Men which was here before con&s;i&s;ted of 14500 Foot and 1000 hor&s;e, and be&s;ides the&s;e, we counted between 12 and 15000 Burghers, Students and Servants, capable to bear Arms. The 13th we &s;et fire to the Suburbs, in which were above 5000 Hou&s;es, and 15 or 16 &s;tately Palaces which were all burnt with their ric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> and co&s;tly Furniture. The 14th the Imperial Cavalry in E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">even Regi|ments, Seven Regiments of Dragoons, Three of Croats, and Sixteen Troops of Poli&s;h Hor&s;e, who the day before had had &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the Enemies Vanguard, marched trough this City, and having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> over Six or Seven Bridges, marched to Corne-Neubourg; the &s;ame day, arrived here Four large Boats with Ammunition, and &s;everal Incendiaries, who intended to fire the Magazing, and in effect, had already burnt &s;everal Hou&s;es very nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> were di&s;covered, and being dragged about the Streets by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> People, were Fleed alive; and the Turks began to inv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> the place. The 15th we were formally be&s;ieged by 150 thou+&s;and fighting Men; The Grand Vi&s;ier taking his Quarters in the Empre&s;s Dowagers Palace, called La Favorite. The Enemy began that very day to fire upon the place, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ned their Trenches the 16th the Enemy fired upon us from Three Batteries, and &s;hot a great many Bombs in to the Town; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in the night, of Leopol&s;tadt, and another &s;mall I&s;le in the <HI>Danube,</HI> by which means they likewi&s;e &s;hut us upon that &s;ide. This day our Governor re|ceived a &s;mall wound in the Hood with a &s;tone, rai&s;ed by a Cannon &s;hot. The 17, 18, and 19 were &s;pent by the Enemy in advancing their approaches to gain the Counter&s;carp; and on our &s;ide we made &s;everal Sallies to hinder them in their Works, the Cannon playing on both &s;ides almo&s;t without in|termi&s;&s;ion. In a Sally we made on the 19th we took two or three pri&s;oners, who told us the Turks were above 100000 fighting Men, be&s;ides 20000 which &s;till kept Raab blocked up, under the Command of two Ba&s;&s;a's. The 20th the Enemy had fini&s;hed a Battery in Leopol&s;tadt, from whence they like|wi&s;e attacked us with their Cannon and Bombs. The 21 our Governor received letters from the Duke of Lorrain promi|&s;ing a &s;peedy Relief. The 23 the Enemy did not make &s;o much u&s;e of their Batteries, as they had hitherto done; but about 7 at night they &s;prang a Mine on each &s;ide of their chief At|tack, which was again&s;t the Lebi Ballion, between tho&s;e of Melcke and the Court, and followed them with three &s;everal A&s;&s;aults in both places, but were &s;o bravely received that they did not advance a hands breadth without very great le&s;s. The 25th they again &s;prang a Mine, and &s;tormed three times, but were repul&s;ed, though with great lo&s;s on our &s;ide. The 26th in the Evening we &s;prang a Mine, but it had not the effect we de&s;ired. The Enemy &s;hot into the Town a Letter, being tied to an Arrow, which our Governor had &s;ome days before writ to the Duke of Lorrain, and this they accompa|nied with another Paper, per&s;wading us to &s;ave our &s;elve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> by yielding in time, and not to irritate the Grand Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk"> The 27th the Enemy again attacked the Counter&s;car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="2">&s;ame places where they &s;prang their Mine the 23 which they renewed four &s;everal times, and were as often beaten off; and thus there did not pa&s;s a day without &s;pringing of Mines on their &s;ide or ours, or without the Enemies making an A&s;&s;ault in one place or another. The third of Augu&s;t about 10 at night, they &s;tormed the Counter&s;carp before the Ra|velin of Burg&s;hor, and after having been repul&s;ed four &s;e|veral times, they lodged them&s;elves there; that day the Enemy rai&s;ed a Battery again&s;t the right face of the Burg Ba&s;tioh. The 6th the Enemy &s;prang &s;everal Mines, and made a de&s;cent into the Ditch, which cau&s;ed a great alarm among us. The 7th we made a Sally, and killed a great many of the Enemy. On the 9th they &s;prang again a Mine which buried many of our Men; in the Evening we made a Sally and ruined their Works in the Ditch, but with great lo&s;s on our &s;ide. The 11th, 12th, and 13th, &s;everal Mines were &s;prung on both &s;ides; The Enemy rai&s;ed &s;everal new Batte|ries, and again lodged them&s;elves in the Ditch, and we made &s;everal Sallies. The 14th they advanced their Works in the Ditch before the Ravelin; and the night following lodged them&s;elves on the point of the Ravelin. The 17th we Sallied out with 200 Men, and ruined their Works in the Ditch; and the next day we beat them from the point of the Ravelin; The dayes following we were in continual action with the Enemy, who had now &s;ecured their Lodgments in the Ditch: And we made &s;everal Retrenchments within the Ba&s;tions; out Gari&s;on begun to be very much weakened, we had lo&s;t a Colonel, five Lieutenant-Colonels, about 30 Captains, and 38 Lieute|nants, and many were &s;ick. The 2 of September the Ene|my &s;prang a Mine-under the Ba&s;tion of Lebl, and blew up the point of it; and thereupon made an A&s;&s;ault with great numbers of men, but were repul&s;ed. The 4th they &s;prang another Mine, which made a breach in the flank of the &s;aid Ba&s;tion, and they endeavoured to lodge them&s;elves there, but were beaten off. The &s;ame day we made &s;igne from St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Tower of the great di&s;tre&s;s we began to be in. The 5th, 6th, and 7th the Enemy made great Efforts to lodge them&s;elves on the Lebl Ba&s;tion. The 8th we di&s;cove|red a great Mine of the Enemies, and took the Powder out of it; and again made &s;igns from St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Tower, for our danger began to be very great. The 9th we &s;aw great part of the Enemies Troops decamp, and march towards <HI>Kalemberg</HI> and the <HI>Forre&s;t,</HI> and we under&s;tood by a Pri&s;o|ner, that they were in great con&s;ternation upon the advice they had of the approach of the Chri&s;tian Army; however they continued to attack us with their Connon and Bombs as furiou&s;ly as ever, and went on with their Mines under the Lebl Ba&s;tion. The 10th at night they &s;prang a Mine, but without any great effect. The 11th in the afternoon the whole Turki&s;h Army marched out of their Camp towards <HI>Kalem|berg;</HI> but at the &s;ame time the Enemy not only kept their Trenches, but continued to fire upon us from their Batte|ries, and to work in their Mines. The 12th they made u&s;e of their Cannon and Bombs as formerly, and we expected eve|ry minute they would &s;pring their Mines; but about four in the Afternoon, we perceived the Enemy were in great con|fu&s;ion, and that they began to flee, and that the Mar|grave of Baden advanced with &s;everal Batallions to our re|lief; upon which our Governour Sallied out, and fell upon the Turks, who were &s;till in their Trenches, and cut them all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> pieces; and about five the Marqui&s;s de Baden entred the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">; the joy of the Inhabitants being equal to the trouble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk">traction they were in before. Our Gari&s;on was redu|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">o Men, and the Enemy had made &s;o great a breach in the Lebl Ba&s;tion, that we had rea&s;on to fear we could not have re&s;i&s;ted their nixt A&s;&s;ault: It's impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cribe the Enemies Works, they are incredible, in their Trenches they were covered as well from the weather as our &s;hot; nor can we pretend to give you here an account of all remarkable pa&s;&s;ages during this famous Siege, from which it plea&s;ed the Divine Goodne&s;s, after Sixty days to deliver us. This inva|&s;ion of the Turks has co&s;t the Lives of 100000 Chri&s;tians, be&s;ides the great Numbers carried into Captivity, and the de&s;olation of this once flouri&s;hing Countrey of Au&s;tria, is &s;o great, that its Ruines cannot be repaired without many Mil|lions, and many years.</P>
<P>The letters from the Imperial Camp near <HI>Gran,</HI> con|firm the account we gave you in our la&s;t, brought hither by the Count <HI>de Lamberg,</HI> of the Victory which the Chri&s;tians obtained again&s;t the Turk at <HI>Barkan,</HI> whereof they give us the following Relation. On the 9th In&s;tant the Imperial and Poli&s;h Armies advanced in order of Battle, the Imperiali&s;ts having the Vanguard, towards <HI>Barkan,</HI> near which place was encamped a Body of between 13 and 14000 Turks, being the be&s;t troops of their remaining Army, they, en|couraged with the advantage they had upon the Poles on the 7th, no &s;ooner &s;aw the Chri&s;tian Army appear, but advan|ced with full &s;peed, and mo&s;t hideous Cries, charged the imperiali&s;ts, and endeavoured to break in upon them; the Chri&s;tians kept them&s;elves very clo&s;e and firm, and repul|&s;ed the Enemy, who then turned towards the Poles, and made a very fierce charge upon them; The Poles received them likewi&s;e with great Bravery, and being very well &s;e|conded by the Imperiali&s;ts, made a great &s;laughter of the Enemy; who &s;eeing one of their chief Ba&s;&s;a's &s;lain, and an other taken Pri&s;oner, fled towards <HI>Barkan;</HI> the Chri&s;tians pur&s;ued them very clo&s;e, and fired upon them with their Cannon, which the King and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> cau&s;ed to advance for that purpo&s;e. Of the Enemy &s;ome got over the Bridge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words">, which happily for us broke, others threw them&s;elves into <HI>Barkan,</HI> &s;ome were drowned, and others taken Pri&s;oners, &s;o that of this whole Body, not above 4000 e&s;caped. The Imperial Foot and Dragoons ad|vanced, and the Regiment of <HI>Ca&s;telli,</HI> and &s;ome other com|manded Troops attacked the Counter&s;carp of <HI>Barkan,</HI> be|ing led on by the Count <HI>de Staremberg,</HI> and took it with their Swords in their hands, and putt all the Turks that were there to the Sword, but gave quarter to 500 Jani&s;aries that were in the place, and who &s;urrendred on di&s;cretion. The Chri|&s;tians, after having pillaged <HI>Barkan,</HI> &s;et fire to it, and as well there as in the Enemies Camp, which covered the &s;aid Fort, as likewi&s;e the City of <HI>Gran,</HI> they had a great deal of Plunder; 20 Pieces of Cannon, with great quantities of Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, and many fine Hor&s;es, with very rich Furniture, were taken; and the Pri&s;oners declare, that after this &s;econd defeat, the Chri&s;tians will not meet with any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance any where, there being a very great con&s;ternation among the Turks. They in <HI>Gran</HI> continued to fire upon the Chri&s;tian Troops that were in &s;ight of them, till night, and renewed the &s;ame the next morning; but their Cannon was but &s;mall, and did us little harm. The Chri&s;tians quite ruined the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> and when thee Letters came away, they were pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Da|nube</HI> over a Bridge of Boats (which was brought from <HI>Comor|ra</HI>) in order to their attacking that place, the principal For|tifications whereof have it's &s;aid been very much damnified by Thunder; and their be&s;t Cannon, and greate&s;t part of their Ammunition &s;ent to the Siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
