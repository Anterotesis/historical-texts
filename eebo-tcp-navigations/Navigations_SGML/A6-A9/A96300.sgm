<P>THere is a paper lately printed, intituled, <HI>The Ri&s;e, Reign, and Ruine, &amp;c.</HI> upon which I had (in regard of the importunity of &s;ome friends, together with the expectation of many others, looking at the task as almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily impo|&s;ed upon me) pre&s;umed to ob&s;erve, and indeed I protracted not for want of time; but in hope &s;ome of the family, or at lea&s;t, through their direction, &s;ome of their friends, would have applyed them&s;elves to it, which when I &s;ee not, I re&s;olved upon it (as upon) (in regard of the premi&s;&s;es) an Indi&s;pen&s;able Act, not out of any affection to be &s;een in Print, but out of a pitie, which I had on Innocence, (unle&s;&s;e by this means) reme|dile&s;ly to be oppre&s;&s;ed under In&s;olence and Malice, as appears in the forenamed di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Where we meet fir&s;t with &s;ome <HI>Apologeticall</HI> pa&s;&s;ages, one of which, is the perfect|ing of a book lately come forth out of the Pre&s;&s;e, <HI>to which,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>he was pre&s;&s;ed by divers;</HI> wherein perhaps he intends, to be <HI>Rhetoricall,</HI> but what is the Re&s;ult of this pre&s;&s;ing, to extract (for&s;ooth) the quinte&s;&s;ence and &s;pirits of the Author: in what? Inperfecting the Hi&s;tory; which terme perhaps he u&s;eth &s;ecretly to excu&s;e the Incompleat|ne&s;&s;e of his Notions for tho&s;e things which are perfective, of another e&s;pecially <HI>per mo|dum formae &s;upervenientis materiae,</HI> (Such at his are pretended) u&s;e to be Incom|pleat: But what perfection doth he intend? what degree of <HI>actus perfectivi</HI> will this man give, &s;uch as the fir&s;t Act gives? No, thats being, or entity meerly, which it &s;eems it had before, or &s;uch as the &s;econd Act adds, thats a form, formality, this &s;urely he would conferre, which he hath done poorly, as appears; or will he go higher, and be&s;tow the per|fection of the third Act upon the &s;econd <HI>exi&s;tence;</HI> and draw it <HI>extra cau&s;as,</HI> that he hath done, <HI>Extra Ideales ac primordiales</HI> in &s;ome places, but by this means he hath brought it within the compa&s;&s;e, of <HI>hic &amp; nune,</HI> which I am glad of, that I may An&s;wer it: But how will he perfect it? He tels us how, by <HI>laying down the &s;en&s;e and order of the &s;tory:</HI> What have we here? a <HI>mythologie?</HI> Reall Hi&s;tories u&s;e to carry their own &s;ence, matters of fact need no comment, fictions have their &s;en&s;es, Fables their Morals. Did his zeal of &s;ending one mite towards the pro&s;tration of the&s;e Opinioni&s;ts pitch his thoughts, impatient of &s;tory, and examining the matter upon glo&s;&s;e and invective? or &s;hall we con&s;true it as a fatall da&s;h of his pen, practically pointing out to us the &s;equell? Or did the man lay down his own &s;en&s;e, when he re&s;olved to lay down the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tory? Order, perhaps the other u&s;ed <HI>Syntheticall,</HI> and began with Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> whom he cals the <HI>head of the faction,</HI> this man will u&s;e <HI>Analyticall</HI> and conclude with her; the fir&s;t its likely was &s;ome &s;imple <HI>Theori&s;t,</HI> this an Actor in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, I warrant you, let him be what he will, he would &s;eem a good <HI>Methodi&s;t,</HI> not in mar|tiall affairs though, for he &s;ets Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> whom he cals, as before, the <HI>Captain</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"> in the rear, which &s;eems to be an error unle&s;&s;e as afraid of a combat he would put his back into a po&s;ture of retreat, which it may be he intends; and &s;o I will follow him. Here is much pretence of conformity to heavens proceedings, while&s;t he &s;aith, <HI>What God hath pardoned in heaven he would not renew on earth:</HI> But he would be excu&s;ed this corre&s;pondence three wayes. Fir&s;t, by declaring this was in print before he medled with it. But ob&s;erve Reader, he is guilty of the <HI>Order and &s;en&s;e</HI> of it. Secondly, by &s;aying <HI>Gods great works mu&s;t be made known:</HI> it &s;eems his works mediately by them are greater then his immediate acts. Thirdly, by that ordinary pretence the nece&s;&s;ity of State, <HI>the times call for his writing,</HI> he &s;aith, he would be thought an Oracle of Imperiall depths; A con&s;iderable penman, upon whom States depend, and who&s;e writings the exi|gences of Kingdoms expect. &V;pon which &s;uppo&s;ition I wonder he took no more pains, for he would make us beleeve, he wanted time, which I cannot think, unle&s;&s;e by his expre&s;|&s;ion <HI>a &s;trait of time,</HI> he mean in allu&s;ion to &s;traits of land, a part of time intercepted twixt two other parts, which might &s;o be a yeer, avd is mo&s;t likely: Or unle&s;&s;e he mean in regard of the pretended &s;ea&s;onablene&s;&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> the opportunity of time; or unle&s;&s;e that the matter of his book were &s;o blamele&s;&s;e as that in charity, we might conceive he did <HI>intueri verbum</HI> when he writ it, and &s;o was in a higher mea&s;ure of his Action then time. But what&s;oever may be allowed him <HI>in patria,</HI> if that will not be granted him <HI>in via,</HI> if he did make u&s;e of time, I am &s;ure he bad a competencie of it at the lea&s;t, for though he be (I will not detract) one of the higher <HI>&s;phaeres,</HI> yet (in which he is higher too) in his di&s;cour&s;es, e&s;pecially polemick, he affects the pace of <HI>Saturne,</HI> under who&s;e planetary houre he was born; but if this content him not, but he will (that he may hurry all after his opinion) needs be &s;tiled <HI>primum mobile,</HI> let him be &s;o; and I in re&s;pect of, and reverence to his grave, and regular motion will be circumvolved a little with him, onely he mu&s;t give me leave in the nature of an Orbe as well as he, though a lower one, to have a proper motion of mine own, wherein though I thwart him, I may perform my own cour&s;e by which I hope to have &s;ome influence upon thee unprejudiced &amp; qualified Reader; which obtained makes the period, and revolution of thy <HI>Mercurie,</HI></P>

<P>ALthough my Intentions be to apply my thoughts to tho&s;e things which do expre&s;ly concern Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> yet &s;eeing I have under|taken to vindicate him, I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ingage my &s;elf in tho&s;e things which are of remoter and more implicite concernment; wherein he is by way of involution, and as the con&s;truction of people ignorant of mat|ters may proceed after a more eminent way di&s;graced, <HI>viz.</HI> in his being put promi&s;cuou&s;ly among&s;t tho&s;e whom they call Antinomians, Libertines, &amp;c. and being equally intituled to the erronious po&s;itions &s;ub&s;equent: a gro&s;&s;e abu&s;e, not onely to him, but to &s;ome others, who are brought upon the &s;tage,
<PB N="3" REF="3">that they &s;hould be thus indi&s;criminately charged as they are in his Preface, which begins thus. <HI>After we had e&s;caped the hands of the per&s;ecuting Prelates,</HI> &amp;c. Yes, then you began to be <HI>prelaticall</HI> your &s;elves, el&s;e why did not you admit tho&s;e men, who left Bi&s;hops as well as ye, to a freedome of &s;pirit, and con&s;ci|ence which they came for? or at the lea&s;t, why did you not protract their cen&s;ures, and give them leave to recover, and recollect them&s;elves after they were out of the hands of tho&s;e Prelates? you might have con&s;ider'd, that it was their good opinion of you, and the reformation among&s;t you, which &s;crued their meditations in way of preparation for your &s;ociety, to a &s;ubli|mation in doctrine, as well as di&s;cipline; and there might be &s;ome di&s;po&s;iti|ons to errours at the fir&s;t, which would neves have advanced &s;o much, had not the <HI>Antiperi&s;ta&s;is</HI> of your vehement pro&s;ecution forced them into a habit; you might have been plea&s;ed to have looked at them as men tran&s;ported, through the fancie of practicall liberty to be injoyed, into &s;ome doctrines of Libertini&s;me, and &s;o have allowed &s;omething to imagination: which is the main, you might haue reviewed your former condition, wherein (as you &s;ay your &s;elves) you were in expo&s;ed to the malice of your <HI>Dioce&s;ans;</HI> divers waies, me thinks, there are whereby you might have taken up your &s;elves in more moderate deportment towards your brethren, then in fining, confining, im|pri&s;oning, disfranchising, bani&s;hing, and as much as in you lay, killing.</P>
<P>The infection which the Churches caught by the&s;e errors &s;wels into three heads, <HI>How they have prevailed, how they reigned, and how they were ruined.</HI> Here is their <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, and here I mu&s;t needs pro&s;ecute that which I before named, <HI>viz.</HI> the unequall (and yet too equall) implication of &s;ome parties, hereafter named in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word">, all which to my certain knowledge, and, I beleeve, to &s;ome of theirs even to the <HI>Author</HI> of the book, are di&s;avow|ed by &s;ome of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Libertines, by name, (for &s;eeing th&s;e tenents were attributed to all, yet not <HI>univocally</HI> but <HI>Analogically,</HI> I mu&s;t apply my &s;elf <HI>ad principale Analogatum</HI>) Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> who hath openly prote&s;ted again&s;t them, witne&s;&s;e <HI>Mount Wollo&s;ton,</HI> where they know, and our Author tels us, that one of his own Scholars told him, <HI>He &s;et up Antichri&s;t becau&s;e he did not complie with him;</HI> a heavie charge, which &s;urely he would never have put up|on Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> to who&s;e Doctrine he ever before a&s;&s;ented, had there been &s;o neer an agreement twixt them as this perfecter tels us, who&s;e words are the&s;e, after he had named the opinions of this Scholar of his as he cals him; <HI>Now</HI> (faith he) <HI>the&s;e things were, &s;o gro&s;&s;e that M</HI> Wheelwright <HI>could not but contra|dict them, yet &s;o tenderly as &s;hewed a near agreement with him in the&s;e points.</HI> And &s;aith moreover, <HI>that they are nece&s;&s;arie con&s;equences which he gathered from his doctrine,</HI> Where there are divers indignities put upon Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> Fir&s;t, that he &s;hould large un&s;ound principles. And &s;econdly, not know their coniectaries
<PB N="4" REF="4">as well as an illiterate man, I can &s;carce for bear to break my order, and fall upon him now, but I &s;hall come at length more fitly to it, and &s;hall trie how well our Author is skilled in <HI>con&s;equences:</HI> in the mean time, I u&s;e this now to let the Reader &s;ee the inju&s;tice of this <HI>Medley</HI> of his; if the heat which in|&s;pires his paper, were true zeal, it would <HI>Congregare hemogenea, &amp; &s;egregare he|terogenea.</HI></P>
<P>There are others too as well as Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> who are not affected with the&s;e paradoxes, as Captain <HI>&V;nderhill</HI> a gentleman, who did good &s;ervice again&s;t the <HI>Pequits,</HI> as it is well known in <HI>New-England,</HI> which their <HI>Emi&s;&s;ary</HI> might have requited better then to have mu&s;tered him among a troop of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> under Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> their Captain, as he cals her. Admit he er|red, yet &s;hall every little errour touching <HI>Divinity</HI> in militarie men, who&s;e &s;tirred humours may ea&s;ily attenuate the &s;pirits, when they &s;o apply them|&s;elves, and refine them into a <HI>nicety,</HI> be heighten'd into herefie, and pre&s;ently &s;een in print? He urged the libertie allowed to Souldiers, in&s;tanced in the freedome of &s;peech he had to <HI>Count Na&s;&s;au.</HI> But my Authors rea&s;on for &s;etting out his book was pretended for his cen&s;ure, <HI>viz.</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity of State, and &s;o the Captain was degraded.</P>
<P>Another mentioned in his Catalogue is Mr. <HI>Edward Hutchin&s;on;</HI> I wonder that he is among&s;t the crowde, when as he did not u&s;e to be factious or opi|nionate. Indeed the <HI>geri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> of that family hath not much inclined to &s;ub|tilties, &s;carce any of the <HI>Hutchin&s;ons</HI> have been Sectaries, unle&s;&s;e <HI>&agrave; latere,</HI> and indirectly, by rea&s;on of which, me thinks, he might have been placed (if it mu&s;t needs be) more obliquely in this predicament of <HI>Famili&s;me,</HI> &amp;c. then he is. This man &s;aid in the Court (which through Chri&s;tian libertie he thought he might very well &s;ay) that If the Court took away his means, he &s;hould not be able to maintain his wife and children. Now the Court when they propounded his Fine, might think, (&s;uppo&s;ing him to be <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tique</HI>) that he would not have looked at means as nece&s;&s;arie, but rather in a holy triumph have pro&s;tituted all, and expected immediate influence: in which he deceived the awfull and &s;erious expectation of the Court, which acce&s;&s;ary contempt committed him, and re-inforced his prepared cen&s;ures; which might be ha&s;tened the rather by this rea&s;on too, the Governor comparing the intended Fine with his e&s;tate, might &s;ee di&s;proportion, which he thought might be called <HI>Contempt in Naturalis,</HI> though not <HI>elicitus;</HI> Or whe|ther they looking at him as apprehen&s;ive of want &s;u&s;pected him; that con|ceit promoted too by a late imagination of the crime, as likely to be &s;edi|tious. However it was, the man was fined fourty pound, and disfranchized.</P>
<P>Another is Mr <HI>Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hutchin&s;on</HI> who (as I remember) upon di&s;like of &s;ome proceedings in Court out of a pang of zeal, though otherwi&s;e no great Crit|tick,
<PB N="5" REF="4">asked a que&s;tion of them in way of &s;eruple, whereupon he was cen&s;u|red guilty of contempt, and (I think) &s;edition too, and &s;o was bani&s;ht. But ob&s;erve the wi&s;dom of the Court, they perceiving, in that he did but meerly ask a que&s;tion, that there were in him &s;ome &s;parks of truth, and ingenuity, &s;ent him to a place called, <HI>The I&s;le of Errours,</HI> that by the <HI>circumob&s;i&s;tence</HI> of corrupt opinions, that little good which he had might be united and forti|fied, and he at length reduced into an hability of cohabitation; which effect it &s;eems it had: for, as I hear &s;ince, he is re&s;umed into their precincts. And this I mu&s;t &s;ay for the Court, they were &s;o courteous to him be&s;ides, (rare le|nity!) as that they allowed him libertie to come to them to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> once a moneth, even during his expul&s;ion; I &s;uppo&s;e in the waning of the Moon, when his hotter &s;its (as they conceived them) were over, thinking that in &s;ome competent time, he might be perfectly cured of the <HI>Lunacie,</HI> which they &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The next are Mr. <HI>Cog&s;hall,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&s;pinall,</HI> which latter for his di&s;like of &s;ome proceedings of Court was bani&s;ht, and Mr. <HI>Cog&s;hall</HI> Deputie, pre&s;uming libertie to di&s;&s;ent from the major part, through reluctation of his con&s;cience, and reflection upon his priviledge, broke forth into this expre&s;&s;ion: <HI>That if he could not be heard, he mu&s;t:</HI> whereat he &s;topt, which might have been well in|terpreted; for being incen&s;ed by rea&s;on of the &s;evere dealing with his bre|thren before him, <HI>per Imperium voluntatis,</HI> and out of brotherly love, he thought he mu&s;t do &s;omething, although his rea&s;on (for the pre&s;ent charm|ed by the <HI>Magick</HI> of the Court &s;o powerfully exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e that were &s;entenced before him) could not tell him what, whereupon he &s;topt at the word <HI>mu&s;t:</HI> for which <HI>apo&s;iope&s;is</HI> he was disfranchized, as one that through &s;uch eloquence might become a pe&s;tilent fellow; but &s;ince he hath lived peaceably, re&s;olving never to di&s;cover more <HI>Rhetorick</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould be ba|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The next in his book is <HI>Tho: Mar&s;hall,</HI> the Ferrie-man, as he calls him; this good man was occupied in a River called <HI>Charles River,</HI> directly betwixt <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the place of the&s;e Opinioni&s;ts, and <HI>Charles Town,</HI> and other Towns, where his &s;pirits being predi&s;po&s;ed by the roughne&s;&s;e of winds and waves, and agitated by <HI>the Counterbuffes</HI> of Divinitie, which the re&s;pective pa&s;&s;engers vented, he might (you will &s;ay) ea&s;ily be inflamed; Put as long as he kept his watery Element he had an allay: which when he left, and went to the Court, whether he did (as referring to the premi&s;&s;es, you may conceive po&s;|&s;ible) rudely enter into the Court, or whether his feaver beat &s;o to his &s;ingers ends, as it urged him to &s;ub&s;cribe to a Petition; however it was, he was pro|nounced guilty (which indeed is common with watermen) of contempt. Hereupon di&s;placed, &s;ince which time, for want of that imployment, he is
<PB N="6" REF="5">grown &s;o poore, that he will not be able to pay the indi&s;pen&s;able halfpeny to <HI>Charon</HI> for his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The next is one <HI>Tho: Grydley, an hone&s;t poore man,</HI> (as the Pamphleter cals him) yet (as he &s;aith) <HI>too bu&s;ie in things above his reach;</HI> alas good man he ne|ver knew that <HI>quae &s;upranos nihil adnos,</HI> but the Court cured him of his prag|maticalne&s;&s;e very well; for they took from him his imployment, and cen&s;u|red him an abettor of <HI>contempt,</HI> and <HI>&s;edition,</HI> which termes he never hearing before, nor not knowing what they might mean, did &s;o <HI>amaze,</HI> and <HI>ma&s;quer</HI> him, that ever &s;ince, in an admiring &s;peculation of, and gazing upon them, he hath &s;tood as in a rapture or <HI>exta&s;ie,</HI> not finding lea&s;ure for new action.</P>
<P>There is one more, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dyer,</HI> he was charged with contempt too, though I think onely disfranchi&s;ed, that his brain might move in a le&s;&s;e compa&s;&s;e, whereupon the good man was united into an ability to deliver his mind concerning an opinion of his in the Church, which our <HI>Author</HI> &s;aith he did weakly too. In &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e me thinks that of the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> might have place: <HI>If any one be over-taken with an errour, ye that are &s;pirituall re&s;tore ye &s;uch a one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t among&s;t the women is Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on.</HI> This is &s;he who he &s;aith <HI>had at once thirty conceptions, &s;ome bigger, &s;ome le&s;&s;er, &s;ome of one &s;hape, &s;ome of ano|ther:</HI> and this he a&s;&s;ures us, &s;aying, <HI>That he hath learned otherwi&s;e (ble&s;&s;ed be his Name) then to delude the world with untruths.</HI> I que&s;tion not his lear|ning, &amp;c. but I admire his certainty, or rather impudence: did the man ob|te&s;tricate? We know (as he &s;aith of him&s;elf, <HI>he &s;ometimes hangs up brats again&s;t the Sun,</HI> but &s;urely he medled not with the&s;e, re&s;erved I &s;uppo&s;e, &amp;c. unle&s;&s;e he had it from him who is &s;o <HI>eccentricke</HI> in his motion (as one &s;aith of him.) But what if he had it from any then pre&s;ent? will that &s;uffice to make him &s;o confident, as thereupon to take occa&s;ion to ingage, and magnifie Divine di|rection, and derive this not known by him to be a truth, from the God of truth? If any of the men he cals Famili&s;ts, &amp;c. had done &s;o, would it not have been accounted irreligious? reli&s;hing of profanenes? &amp;c. would not my Authors &s;ofte&s;t expo&s;ition have called it un&s;avourie?</P>
<P>As for his <HI>Analogy,</HI> which he ob&s;erves betwixt her productions and opini|ons, <HI>That as &s;he held thirty of the one, &s;o &s;he brought forth thirty of the other; Gods wi&s;|dome</HI> (he &s;aith) <HI>fitting tho&s;e to the&s;e:</HI> It is a mon&s;trous conception of his brain, a &s;purious i&s;&s;ue of his intellect, acted upon by a &s;weati&s;h and Feaveri&s;h zeal, which indeed beats almo&s;t in every line; and re&s;olves his in them&s;elves im|perfect &s;ometimes, if not felgned facts into phanatique meditations. For fir&s;t the proportion is not exact, for he reckons not 30. opinions which he cals, Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;ons,</HI> and tho&s;e many of them coincident too, made more I &s;up|po&s;e to prepare for his conceit. Secondly, but admit it were, yet his Notion
<PB N="7" REF="5">is impertinent, for he brings in defects of Nature, among&s;t defects of Man|ners. All he can &s;ay (if he were &s;o acute) is, that tho&s;e are the&s;e <HI>reductive,</HI> and as they are effects of &s;in. A poore plea, by the &s;ame rea&s;on he may under the &s;ame title di&s;cover all the weakne&s;&s;es and naturall imperfections either of man or woman, and fix a kind of morality upon them: But he will &s;ay perhaps, that this birth was an extraordinary defect: It avails nothing, un|le&s;&s;e he will either rai&s;e it to a miracle, or at the lea&s;t prove a &s;upernaturall remi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>formative virtue in her.</HI> That will require a mo&s;t accurate phy|&s;icall in&s;pection which I think his learning will not reach, although (for ought I can &s;ee) his mode&s;ty might: for he tels us of women <HI>purging and vo|miting,</HI> what if the di&s;temper we u&s;ually call <HI>Cholera</HI> did for the pre&s;ent op|pre&s;&s;e tho&s;e women? mu&s;t it needs be proclaimed? mu&s;t it needs be in print?</P>
<P>As for Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> &s;he was a woman of a good wit, and not onely &s;o, which is all he will allow her, but naturally of a good judgement too, as ap|peared in her civill occa&s;ions; In &s;pirituals indeed &s;he gave her under&s;tand|ing over into the power of &s;ugge&s;tion and immediate dictates, by rea&s;on of which &s;he had many &s;trange fancies, and erroneous tenents po&s;&s;e&s;t her, e&s;pe|cially during her confinement, where &s;he might feel &s;ome effect too from the quality of humors, together with the advantage the devill took of her con|dition attended with melancholy. In a word, as guilty of mo&s;t of the&s;e er|rours, and for a pretended revelation of the de&s;truction of the <HI>Court,</HI> &s;he was expelled the <HI>Bay of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI></P>
<P>The next is Mrs. <HI>Dyer,</HI> the wife of Mr. <HI>Dyer</HI> aforenamed, &s;he was devoted to Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;ons</HI> fancies; this is &s;he, who (he &s;ayes) had the mon&s;ter: whe|ther the conceptions of her brain had influence upon the conceptions of her wombe, or the&s;e of the wombe upon tho&s;e of the brain, I will not di&s;cu&s;&s;e. This <HI>di&s;coverer</HI> inclines to the former, I think he might by a deeper &s;earch have reached the naturall cau&s;e while&s;t he in his <HI>Method</HI> telling us her pe|naltie, judges her for her errours immediately &s;entenced from heaven: in which pa&s;&s;age, as in many other in his book, a &s;pirit of cen&s;ure and malice is pregnant.</P>
<P>The other he &s;peaks of is one good wife <HI>Hunkins,</HI> who, he &s;aith, is a <HI>witch;</HI> a poore filly woman, yet having &s;o much wit, as perceiving Mrs. <HI>Hutchin:</HI> am|bitious of <HI>pro&s;elytes,</HI> to &s;upply her wants, &s;he attended on her weekly <HI>Lecture,</HI> (as it is called) where when Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> broached any new doctrine, &s;he would be the fir&s;t would ta&s;te of it: And being demanded whether it were not clear to her, though &s;he under&s;tood it not, yet would &s;ay, <HI>Oh yes very clear.</HI> By which means &s;he got, through Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;ons</HI> affection to her, &s;ome good victuals, in&s;omuch that &s;ome &s;aid &s;he followed Chri&s;t for <HI>loaves;</HI> Now &s;eeing tho&s;e things were &s;o, me thinks our <HI>Author</HI> need not have been &s;o rigid
<PB N="8" REF="6">in his opinion of her. Alas, <HI>Ars illae &s;ua cen&s;us erat,</HI> &s;urely a little le&s;&s;e gall would (as concerning others, &s;o her) have done better in his ink, when, as it appears, &s;he complied with her <HI>patrone&s;&s;e,</HI> not &s;o much out of love to her <HI>po&s;itions</HI> as <HI>po&s;&s;ets,</HI> being guilty I think of no other <HI>&s;orcerie,</HI> unle&s;&s;e it were conjuring the &s;pirit of <HI>Errour</HI> into a <HI>Cordiall.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having given you an account of the&s;e per&s;ons, and pa&s;&s;ages, I can|not but ob&s;erve the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> which all the&s;e men might propound to them&s;elves, for doing and &s;aying what they did. Alas, we mu&s;t look at them as men who had left their e&s;tates, friends, plea&s;ures of their native &s;oyl, &s;pirituall <HI>Chy|mi&s;ts,</HI> extracting the &s;weetne&s;&s;e of all into freedom of con&s;cience, doubting not but they might find all in that <HI>Elixar;</HI> but as no <HI>Chymi&s;t</HI> yet got it, &s;o they were many of them deceived; which when they &s;urveyed, and &s;ee the re&s;ult, it might trouble the weaker, and through melancholy fumes di&s;po&s;e them to &s;trange fancies in Divinity.</P>
<P>Secondly, the verdict of the <HI>Court</HI> upon them all, <HI>contempt,</HI> which &s;urely mu&s;t proceed from the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion that the &s;uppo&s;ed contempt of Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> made in the fancie of the <HI>Governor;</HI> by rea&s;on of which prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion he could conceive no other crime, el&s;e it cannot but &s;eem &s;trange, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> that &s;o many men and women too, who&s;e &s;ex may inequalize and difference much, &s;hould all run into the &s;ame <HI>praemwrire,</HI> Such a continuity of &s;pirits as this con&s;ent of theirs mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, would be a good principle of the Art of the Weapon-&s;alve.

In the under&s;tanding he weakens you two wayes, by an inordination of things, and tearms; of things, in the errors; of tearms, in the un&s;avoury &s;peeches (as he cals them;) in practi&s;e, by all the po&s;&s;ible differen|ces of exorbitancie, <HI>pride, boldne&s;&s;e, in&s;olence, deceit, contempt, &s;edition, &s;chi&s;me;</HI> all which are indifferently, and indi&s;tinctly charged upon you in the Pre|face, &s;o that indeed who reads it would think you all equally guilty: and had I any <HI>premi&s;&s;es</HI> of the &s;ame nature, concerning &s;ome of you, as I have concerning Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> I &s;hould vindicate you, as I do him. But &s;eeing I have not, I mu&s;t apply my &s;elf to him particularly, and free him from tho&s;e errours and un&s;avoury &s;peeches, wherein I do but proceed according to the Rule of <HI>Art</HI> which attends <HI>principale analogatum,</HI> which by his own &s;aying in his 31. <HI>pag.</HI> is Mr. <HI>Wheelwright;</HI> Now, &s;aith he, <HI>all the&s;e, except Mr.</HI> Wh: <HI>were but young branches,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The way wherby I mu&s;t vindicate Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> is from my Authors own lines in his 42. <HI>page,</HI> where he tels us of the opinions which he (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI>) oppo&s;ed being the&s;e.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That there are immediate revelations without the Word.</HI> Secondly, <HI>That the child of God is dead, not acting at all, but as Chri&s;t acts in him. Thirdly, that there is no inherent righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e in the Saints. Fourthly, that the Commandment is a dead letter.</HI> Now if Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> (as the Author gives us) do abhor the&s;e po|&s;itions, let right rea&s;on, and the &s;trength of <HI>con&s;equence</HI> judge whether he can be ju&s;tly entituled either to the un&s;avourie &s;peeches, or to any of the errours; And fir&s;t for the <HI>un&s;avonry &s;peeches.</HI> If Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> oppugne the opinion of <HI>immediate revelations,</HI> how can he &s;ay that evidencing ju&s;tification by &s;an|ctification &s;avours of <HI>Rome?</HI> For if he denie immediate, he mu&s;t grant me|diate: And that <HI>mediante verbo,</HI> either in an ab&s;olute, (as he grants at the fir&s;t) or in a conditionall promi&s;e, as he holds at the <HI>&s;econd evidence;</HI> And many can witne&s;&s;e who have heard him approve evidence of ju&s;tification by &s;an|ctification, but what need of that? doth it not appear in the <HI>principles,</HI> they them&s;elves do happily give me?</P>
<P>How can he hold, he is never the wor&s;e for being unholy, nor the better for being holy, when he grants evidence from holine&s;&s;e?</P>
<P>Or how can he &s;ay, if <HI>Christ</HI> will let me &s;in, let him; when as he holds Chri&s;tians have life in them&s;elves, a <HI>principle</HI> from which they act.

<P>Or how can he &s;ay, <HI>I &s;eek not grace but Chri&s;t,</HI> if it be meant in <HI>contempt</HI> of graces? would any man neglect his <HI>evidences?</HI> unle&s;&s;e he mean thus?

<P>Or how can he &s;ay, <HI>[I know I am Chri&s;ts, not becau&s;e I do crucifie the fle&s;h, but becau&s;e I do not;]</HI> when he expects te&s;timony of &s;alvation by &s;uch acts of crucifying?</P>
<P>Or this, <HI>If Chri&s;t be my &s;anctification, what need I look for any thing to evidence my ju&s;tification,</HI> when as it is of the &s;ame nature with the former, and lies expo&s;ed to the &s;ame incon&s;i&s;tence?</P>
<P>Now I come to the fir&s;t number of errours, wherein although many things be <HI>coincident</HI> with the former un&s;avoury &s;peeches, and with the latter num|ber, yet I &s;hall give you an exact account of the particulars: and as for the fir&s;t of them which is, <HI>That the preaching of the Law is of no u&s;e to drive a man to Chri&s;t:</HI> How can he hold it, when as he &s;aith, Faith comes by hearing the Word? Now if he allow the Word in <HI>Actu completivo,</HI> in the completure and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> of a Chri&s;tians mind, much more in &s;ome preparatorie and di&s;|po&s;itive acts, as is <HI>drawing to Chri&s;t;</HI> know, that rea&s;on gives that a di&s;po&s;i|tive

<P>Or the &s;econd, <HI>That a man is united to Chri&s;t without faith, yea from eternity:</HI> if it be meant re&s;pecting Gods decree, it is true; but if actually, how can Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> hold it, when as he grants there is &s;omething on mans part to receive Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>Or the third, viz. <HI>That faith is not a mans receiving of Chri&s;t, but a mans per|ceiving it:</HI> this is true if <HI>de reflexo actu;</HI> fal&s;e, if <HI>de directo actu:</HI> what matter in this?

<P>For the fourth, <HI>That a man is united to Chri&s;t without any act of his:</HI> it is the &s;ame with the &s;econd, and may receive the &s;ame an&s;wer.</P>
<P>For the fifth, which is, <HI>That a man hath never effectually Chri&s;t till he hath a&s;&s;|urance:</HI> it is the &s;ame with the third, and is true if meant <HI>de certitudine objecti:</HI> but if <HI>&s;ubjecti,</HI> how can Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI> hold it, when as he holds the u&s;e of &s;ignes, to confirm faith in the regenerate? Which mu&s;t needs allow it &s;ome latitude, and not limit it to a meer <HI>plerophory;</HI> and &s;urely one man never held the fourth opinion and this too; that &s;aying, that a man is united to Chri&s;t without any act of his, this, that a man cannot be Chri&s;ts till he have acted, <HI>viz. reflected;</HI> the&s;e were not &s;o con&s;iderately jumbled together, e&s;pecially be|ing <HI>one factions brood,</HI> as he &s;aith.

For the fixt, which is, that the witnes of the Spirit is meerly immedi|ate, without any re&s;pect to the Word, how can Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI> hold it when as he oppo&s;ed the opinion of immediate revelation?</P>
<P>The &s;eventh is, <HI>When a man hath the witne&s;&s;e of the Spirit he never doubts more:</HI> How can Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI> hold this if he know what doubt means, being <HI>motus &s;uper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tramque partem contradictionis:</HI> when as he grants preventives of the motion or deviation betwixt the&s;e two tearms; in granting confirmation, which is a &s;upply of a defect, or an <HI>acce&s;&s;ary</HI> to a <HI>principall</HI> expo&s;ed to &s;ome degree of doubt?</P>
<P>For the ninth, it fals the &s;ame with this former, and being in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, onely differenced by a &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e or occa&s;ion, it will not call for a &s;peciall an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The tenth is, <HI>Sanctification can be to evidence of a mans good e&s;tate;</HI> How can Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI> hold this when as he oppugnes immediate revelations without the word? Why then he mu&s;t grant mediate; and why may not that word refer to &s;anctitie?</P>
<P>The 12, <HI>viz. No comfort can be lead from any conditionall promi&s;e:</HI> How can it

<P>The 12. is, <HI>that to &s;ee I have no grace at all, is true poverty of &s;pirit,</HI> and it comes to the &s;ame with &s;ome of the former.</P>
<P>The 13 is, <HI>That the graces of Saints and hypocrites differ not:</HI> How can there be evidence from them unle&s;&s;e they <HI>differ?</HI> It may be this is the meaning, they differ not by any po&s;itiue thing <HI>&s;uperadded,</HI> but praeci&s;ely in their owne <HI>Natures,</HI> and are not &s;o properly called <HI>different</HI> as <HI>diver&s;e;</HI> but this is a meere nicetie.</P>
<P>The 14 <HI>A hypocrite may have</HI> Adams <HI>graces which he had in his innocencie:</HI> it comes to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with the former.</P>

<P>By our Rea&s;on <HI>of caincidence</HI> we pa&s;&s;e to the 28, which is the fir&s;t we can find challenging a particular an&s;wer, and that &s;carcely too; it is this: <HI>To af|firm, there mu&s;t be faith on mans part, to receive Chri&s;t, it to undermine Chri&s;t:</HI> this is nothing, but an <HI>efflux</HI> of the formen fancie of <HI>hypo&s;tatioall</HI> union; the u&s;e of faith is to apprehend Chri&s;t <HI>&s;ub eonceptu formali:</HI> the effect of which is a <HI>&s;piritu|all</HI> union, not at all in that which may be more <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> looked at, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>hypo&s;taticall:</HI> The next con&s;iderable is the 33, which is this, <HI>To act by vertue of a command is legall.</HI> This is Mr. <HI>Wh:</HI> which taken <HI>cum grano &s;alis,</HI> will be &s;avoury enough. Let us know to act legally may be taken two wayes: <HI>Vel non atten|dendo principium effecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">um action is, vel formale &s;iv&egrave; exemplare.</HI> In the fir&s;t Rea&s;on, they act legally who think to do things in their own &s;trength <HI>formally.</HI> In the &s;econd, they act legally who think to do &s;o <HI>con&s;tructive,</HI> and by way of inter|pretation, &s;uch as the <HI>Go&s;pels young man,</HI> who did fulfill the Commandments <HI>&s;ub ratione particulari,</HI> In which act he expected vertue from Chri&s;t, and &s;o in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e acted not legally.

To act <HI>legally</HI> is to recede from the virtue, by which one is to act; which virtue of Chri&s;t is <HI>vel Chri&s;ti tanquam officientis, vel tanquant Ideae.</HI> To act by vertue of a command, that is immediately from it, is, <HI>Vel immediatione virtueis, vel &s;uppo&s;iti:</HI> they who act by &s;trength of a command in this fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, attend not Chri&s;t either in the rea&s;on of an <HI>efficient</HI> or <HI>Ideae,</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t needs act legally both wayes.

<P>The next con&s;iderable is the 41. which is this: <HI>There be di&s;tinct &s;ea&s;ons of the workings of the per&s;ons in the &s;acred Trinity, &s;o that a man may be &s;aid to be thus long under the work of the Father, and thus long under the work of the Son, and thus long under the work of the holy Ghost.</HI> If by this, we are &s;o long under the Father, he intended onely an exclu&s;ion of the Son in &s;ome <HI>eminence,</HI> and degree of at|tribution.

<P>The next con&s;iderable is this: to <HI>lay the Brethren under a covenant of works hurts not at all, but tends to much good.</HI> What did I &s;ay con&s;iderable? a po&s;i|tion &s;trangely produced as it were in an indifference twixt truth and errour: if it be pre&s;ented as an errour, we mu&s;t needs by rea&s;on of the indefinitenes of the phra&s;e &s;uppo&s;e all Brethren to be under <HI>a covenane of grace.</HI> If it be a truth, what doth it among errours? to make even number? What &s;hall we &s;ay? its neither true nor fal&s;e, but &s;tands in a pure preci&s;ion; he imagined though perhaps that the confinity of errours (wherein ob&s;erve how his malice mul|tiplies here&s;ies upon them) would determine its <HI>neutrality,</HI> and hereupon in|gages at once all his <HI>Metaphy&s;icks</HI> to effect an ab&s;traction which he might

But he &s;aith, if it be good to lay the Brethren under a Covenant of works, then it is good to bite one another: which argument is much like one of his brats he hangs up again&s;t the Sun.</P>
<P>The next is this: <HI>Faith ju&s;tifies an unbeleever.</HI> If the &s;en&s;e be, that the faith &s;ubjected in Chri&s;t ju&s;tifies me in whom there is not any, its fal&s;e: if you take it in <HI>&s;en&s;u compo&s;ito,</HI> it is &s;o, if <HI>in divi&s;o,</HI> its true.
