<HEAD>Some Con&s;iderations on the Propo&s;al of the Old Ea&s;t-India Company, as it re|lates,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>To the</HI> New Company, <HI>and other Sub&s;cribers to the Two Millions, to whom the Trade was &s;old for a limited time.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>To the Per&s;ons who are to Sub&s;cribe to the New Loan at</HI> 5 l. per Cent. <HI>in ca&s;e the Propo&s;al take effect.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT the <HI>Old Company,</HI> before the late Act for Settling the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Idies,</HI> had no Right in Law to the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> Exclu&s;ive of all others, nor any Right by their Charters, but what was &s;ubject to a Provi&s;o upon being Di&s;&s;olved upon Three years Notice, has been in &s;everal Prints un|an&s;werably made out; And the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons Twice Addre&s;s'd the King to Di&s;&s;olve them; Afterwards the <HI>Old Company</HI> pro|po&s;ed to the Hou&s;e to Lend 700000 <HI>l.</HI> to have the Trade to them|&s;elves, exclu&s;ive of others, for Thirty one years; And the Hou&s;e wanting Money for the Service of the Government, and being wil|ling to Settle the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> invited all Per&s;ons to make Propo|&s;als to that purpo&s;e; Others, not of the <HI>Company,</HI> propo&s;ed to Lend Two Millions, and to demon&s;trate the Probability of Advancing that Sum, did in a few days Sub&s;cribe about 1300000 <HI>l.</HI> and brought in their Sub&s;criptions and Propo&s;al to the Hou&s;e, which was accepted; and in pur&s;uance thereof, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, with &s;uch Conditions, Re|&s;trictions, and Regulations, as the Parliament thought proper; And,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 760. <HI>P.</HI> 780.</NOTE> particularly, the Sole Trade to <HI>India</HI> was granted to &s;uch as &s;hould Lend Money upon the Fund Settled by the &s;aid Act, &s;ubject to a Power of Redemption by Parliament upon Three years Notice after the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1711. and no otherwi&s;e, nor in any &s;horter time.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Company</HI> having Sub&s;cribed to the &s;aid Loan 1663000 <HI>l.</HI> became thereupon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;aid Right of Trade for that Sum yearly, according to the &s;aid Act, and His Maje&s;ty's Charter founded thereon; and many of the Members of the &s;aid Company diverted them&s;elves from other Affairs, &s;old Tallies at great lo&s;s, and other|wi&s;e put them&s;elves to Streights to Serve the Government, by the Advance of the &s;aid Money; tho' at the &s;ame time they could have
<PB REF="2" MS="y">bought Tallies that carried Eight <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t on Parliamentary Funds, at 30 and 25 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> lo&s;s, that is to &s;ay, 100 <HI>l.</HI> for 70 or 75 <HI>l.</HI> And this they did in confidence of enjoying the Agreement &s;tipulated with them by the mo&s;t Publick and Solemn Act the Nation is capable of. In pur&s;uance of this Contract the <HI>New Company</HI> have ex|pended great Sums in Settling them&s;elves, and great Factories in &s;everal parts of <HI>India,</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Borneo.</HI> And therefore the &s;aid Agreement cannot with Right be broken, nor the &s;aid Trade taken away from the Per&s;ons in whom the Property is ve&s;ted, nor has &s;uch a thing ever been done by any Parliament.</P>
<P N="2">II. As their Propo&s;al relates to &s;uch as &s;hall come in and &s;ub|&s;cribe;</P>
<P N="1">1. They, are only to be allowed a limited Sum, and mu&s;t come in upon a certain Valuation of the <HI>Old Companies</HI> Stock, which con&s;ider|ing the large Engagements and Claims they are under, and lyable, to in <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> if any be &s;o unwary as to be drawn in and di&s;apointed in the real value of it, as many were by unwarrantable Artifices upon the la&s;t Sub&s;cription to the <HI>Old Companies</HI> Stock, it will occa&s;ion great Complaints by tho&s;e who will ju&s;tly blame them, who have been the cau&s;e of their Misfortune.</P>
<P N="2">2. They can have no Security, that the Trade granted them, will not be taken from them in another Parliament, be their Right never &s;o clear in the Apprehen&s;ion of them&s;elves, and the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P N="3">III. As it relates to the Credit of the Nation, nothing can be more fatal to that, than a Propo&s;al to the Parliament to break a Solemn Agreement made with Per&s;ons without Doors in a matter that meerly relates to Property as this does; The Reference from the Hou&s;e to the Committe is to receive Propo&s;als for Paying off the Debts of the Nation, and advancing the Publick Credit; and this would be in|tirely to de&s;troy the Publick Credit, for Credit is the &s;ame in Pub|lick Societies as in Private Men; Nothing gains or pre&s;erves Credit to a Man, but a punctual Compliance with his Contracts and Agree|ments; the failing therein de&s;troys his Credit, and no body will afterwards tru&s;t him that does &s;o. The Ca&s;e will be the &s;ame with the Parliament; if they break one Contract, by the &s;ame Rule they may break all; and he that lends Money or purcha&s;es either the Forfeited E&s;tates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or any other E&s;tates, may have the &s;ame taken away in whole or in part, whenever the Parliament plea&s;es: The Con&s;equence whereof will be, That no body will lend or purcha&s;e on &s;uch precarious Security, let the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Government be never &s;o great.</P>
