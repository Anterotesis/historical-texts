<HEAD>A GENERALL REMEMBRANCE FOR A SERVANT WHEN HE FIRST trauelleth to the Sea, as to Spaine or Por|tingale, or other countreyes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Emanuel</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_A GENERAL remem|brance for you my &s;er|uant I. A. that when it plea&s;eth God you &s;hall trauell vnto the &s;ea, fir&s;t &amp; principally you doe not forget v|pon your fafe arriuall at your Port, to giue vnto God mo&s;t hartie and humble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For to feare God, and to be thankefull vnto him, is the be|ginning of all happine&s;&s;e and pro&s;peritie in our affaires.</NOTE> thankes for his gracious protection of you, by &s;aying as in token of your thankefulne&s;&s;e, &s;ome godly prayer of thanke&s;giuing, or &s;ay onely with re|uerence the Lords prayer, giuing him withall thankes in &s;ome wordes of your owne &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Secondly, that pre&s;ently vpon your arriuall, you doe make diligent inquirie, whether anie
<PB N="2" REF="6"> &s;hips be bound either to this Port of Bri&s;towe, or to any part of England. And then haue e&s;pe|ciall care, that the neere&s;t that commeth to this Port, you write letters by them vnto me, and to them that you haue to deale for, of the arriuall of your &s;hip: according to this plaine and briefe forme of inditing, as I will hereafter &s;hew you. And &s;o write likewi&s;e by your fir&s;t letters, of the &s;tate of your bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and of the newes of the country, according as that time pa&s;&s;eth. And when you haue learned of anie &s;hip that commeth for England, doe not your &s;elfe make it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This I &s;ay: to procure the more care and diligence in a youth.</NOTE> knowen to anie bodie at all: but write and deliuer your letters &s;ecretlie, for it &s;hall &s;ound much to your e&s;peciall credit and good liking, when your diligence &s;hall be &s;o &s;eene, that your letters &s;hall &s;hew the fir&s;t arri|uall of your Ship: becau&s;e it is the thing that euerie Marchant doth e&s;pecially long after to vnder&s;tand.</P>
<P>Thirdly, deale clo&s;ely &amp; &s;ecretly in all your affaires and bu&s;ynes, and before you enterpri&s;e any thing, doe you after curteous and gentle manner aske coun&s;el, either of &s;ome Marchant in the Ship, or your Ho&s;te, or of &s;ome Engli&s;h man: how you are to deale about your wares, both touching the landing it, the cu&s;toming it, the &s;elling it, the receauing of your moneyes, the buying of any wares againe, the cu&s;toming the &s;ame againe, and to haue out all your writs
<PB N="3" REF="6"> and di&s;patches for euery &s;uch thing, as is need|full to be had. And hauing bin thus once in|&s;tructed, do you with carefullnes remember it of your &s;elfe again&s;t another time. Al&s;o be ear|ne&s;t in noting &amp; marking euery thing that you may, but be your &s;elfe as &s;ecret and &s;ilent as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Fourthly in any ca&s;e &s;hew your &s;elfe lowly, curteous, and &s;eruiceable vnto euery per&s;on: for though you &amp; many of vs el&s;e may think, that too much lowline&s;&s;e bringeth contempt and di&s;grace vnto vs: yet a&s;&s;uredly (it is wel known by experience) that there &s;pringeth of no one vertue &s;o great fruit vnto vs, as of gentlene&s;&s;e and humilitie: for it will both appea&s;e the an|ger and ill will of our enemies, &amp; encrea&s;e the good will of our friends. Al&s;o in any wi&s;e be not &s;educed by any per&s;on, to play at any kinde of game, e&s;pecially dice or cards, nor to v&s;e fea|&s;ting or banketing, or keeping company with women, nor to go fine and co&s;tly in apparell: for all the&s;e things are e&s;pecially noted, and doe bring any yong beginner to vtter di&s;credit and vndoing.</P>
<P>Fiftly carie this for an e&s;peciall note, that when&s;oeuer you haue dealings for anie mar|chants, you do in all things and euerie point ob&s;erue according to their commi&s;&s;ion and di|rection. For although I knowe, it will &s;ome|times &s;eeme to your &s;elfe, that you &s;hall better
<PB N="4" REF="7"> plea&s;e your marchant, not to buy tho&s;e wares which he appointeth, becau&s;e of the dearene&s;&s;e of them: yet (I &s;ay) you &s;hall giue euermore be&s;t contentment to your marchant, and &s;aue your &s;elfe harmele&s;&s;e, when you followe his owne order and remembrance. And take this al&s;o for a caueat, that you neuer think the &s;ame ware which is be&s;t cheape, and is mo&s;t bought vp, that it will be be&s;t to be&s;tow your money theron: for ordinarily it falleth out, that the quantitie of the be&s;t cheape wares that is brought home, hath &s;maller vtterance and le&s;&s;e profite, then &s;uch deare wares as there com|meth but very litle quantitie of. Al&s;o be care|full in &s;etting vp &s;afely your money when you haue receaued it: and likewi&s;e be warie whe~ you receiue your moneys for your wares, crauing the paines of &s;ome marchant your freind, as to helpe you the fir&s;t time to receaue it for you, vntill you haue more knowledge to receaue it your &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Moreouer be you in any wi&s;e circum&s;pect touching your behauiour when you be in the countrey of Spaine or el&s;e where: and &s;hewe your &s;elfe lowly and courteous to all people, and learne what be their ciuill lawes and cu|&s;tomes, and be carefull to keepe them. If anie of the rude and common &s;ort of people (as &s;o it is in all countreys) will by chaunce offer you anie abu&s;e or wrong, appea&s;e them againe ra|ther
<PB N="5" REF="7"> by &s;ufferance and gentlene&s;&s;e, then by reuenge: for &s;o &s;hall you be&s;t quiet your &s;elfe, &amp; ouercome your enemie. In the &s;ales of your wares, doe you, before you &s;et price of it to any man, make inquirie howe other Engli&s;h men haue &s;old the like commodities, and &s;o do you accordingly &s;et pri&s;e of yours. And lightly doe not refu&s;e the &s;econd or third chapmans offer: for mo&s;t ordinarily it falleth out, that the fir&s;t and fourth offer is neuer &s;o good as the third offer: but in this you are to haue a good in&s;ight your &s;elfe, and to do according as is your ha&s;t and nece&s;&s;itie for your &s;ales.</P>
<P>Be mo&s;t faithful &amp; iu&s;t in all your accompts with euery man, &amp; defraud no man willingly not the value of a farthing. See that at no time you do take any mans doings or dealings into your hands, without my leaue and coun&s;ell: be|cau&s;e by the trouble of other mens bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, you may neglect &amp; fru&s;trate mine owne. And haue al&s;o regarde, for tho&s;e &s;mall aduentures which I &s;hall licence you to make for your owne priuate benefit, that euery voiage you doe deliuer mean accompt of it, wherby from time to time I may &s;ee and know your e&s;tate, and what of right doeth aperteine vnto you. Be circum&s;pect and nigh in all your expences; making your reckoning, that what you now &s;pare and &s;aue vnto me, it may grow the more to your owne benefit in time to come.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<P>La&s;tely let this be yet your fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t point in all your actions: that e&s;pecially you o|mit not your dutifull &s;eruice towards almighty God, but euerie morning and night, to pray that God will &s;till pro&s;per and protect you, &amp; to giue him humble thankes that he hitherto hath alwayes mercifully defended you. And this doe you performe, by &s;aying &s;ilentlie, re|uerently, &amp; atentiuely, &s;uch praiers as you haue learned by hart: or it your memorie cannot well reme~ber any other praier, &s;ay only to the prai&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, the * Lords praier and the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This order of prayer I haue thought, might be good and godly: both be|cau&s;e of the country beyond the &s;eas, and becau&s;e of mar+chants lets and hinderance to continue in long prayer.</NOTE> Creed, v&s;ing euermore withall the&s;e three pointes of meditation.

<HEAD>HERE FOLLOVVE CER|TAINE GODLY SENTENCES, NE|ce&s;&s;arie for a youth to meditate vpon.</HEAD>
<P>_FIRST &s;eeke the kingdome of God and the righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e thereof: and then all things &s;hall be giuen thee that thou ha&s;t neede of.</P>
<P>Apply thy &s;elfe vnto labour while thou art young, le&s;t in thine old age thy body become full of di&s;ea&s;es, and thy ende be in reproch and pouertie.</P>
<P>The godly and diligent man &s;hall haue pro|&s;peritie in all his wayes: but he that followeth plea&s;ure and voluptuou&s;ne&s;&s;e, &s;hall haue much &s;orow before he die.</P>
<P>Take heede of v&s;ing a fal&s;e ballance or mea|&s;ure, for it is an abhomination before God: and a &s;wearing and lying tongue, maketh hote the cur&s;e of God vpon his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Couet not ouermuch familiaritie among&s;t men: for it maketh thee &s;pend much lo&s;&s;e of time.</P>
<P>Let not thy expences be equall with thy
<PB N="62" REF="36"> gaynes: for either Sicknes, naughtie dettors, let of trade, and misfortune by the &s;ea or land, may &s;oone ouetthrow thee.</P>
<P>Linke not in amity with too many me~ that are aboue thy calling: for it will much increa&s;e thy trouble and charge.</P>
<P>Beware in any ca&s;e of &s;uerti&s;hip: for it ma|keth thy friend thine enemy; it indangereth thy e&s;tate; and impaireth thy owne credit.</P>
<P>Be not ha&s;ty in giuing credit to euery man; but take heed to a man that is ful of words, that hath red eyes, that goeth much to law, and that is &s;u&s;pected to liue vncha&s;te.</P>
<P>When thou promi&s;e&s;t any thing: be not &s;lacke to performe it, for he that giueth quick|ly, giueth double.</P>
<P>If either of goodwill or neces&s;ity thou mu&s;t doe a thing, &s;ee thou do it gladly &amp; cheerfully: for &s;o &s;hall thy gift be well accepted, &amp; thy la|bour and co&s;t neuer a whit the more.</P>
<P>Remember often thy Creator, and how he hath made the whol compa&s;&s;e of the day and night to &s;erue thee, but thee to &s;erue only him. Wherefore if thou requite not thy maker, to &s;erue him one houre or litle mome~t of the day, for foure and twenty houres which he &s;erueth thee: for thy bea&s;tly vnthankfulnes thou ha&s;t lo&s;t both thy light in this world, and &s;halt find darknes in the world to come.</P>
<P>If thou wilt pro&s;per, pray: if thou wilt haue
<PB N="63" REF="36"> ble&s;&s;inges, re&s;tore what thou ha&s;t euill got|ten: if thou wilt haue ioye of thy labours, be &s;ingle in thy tongue and eye, v&s;e no lying nor deceit.</P>
<P>Thinke it not inough to refraine thee from doing euill: but know that it is al&s;o thy dutie to do that which is good. Therefore be ferue~t for the prai&s;e of thy Creator: geue good ex|ample: put forwards thy Children &amp; &s;eruants in the &s;eruice of God: help the widow, the fa|therle&s;&s;e, the &s;tranger, the poore, and the op|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Do vnto another as thou woulde&s;t be done to thy &s;elfe: and offer not that vnto another, which thy &s;elf woulde&s;t take in offence.</P>
<P>Be not greedy nor in lu&s;t after that, which is both di&s;plea&s;ant vnto God; hurtfull to thy body; an enemy to thy &s;oule; and a &s;hortner of thy life: which is: Wine, Wealth, and Women.</P>
<P>What winneth a man by whordome? euen but a moment any plea&s;ure; a pre&s;ent &s;orrow to his minde; a perpetuall &s;icknes to his bodie; and eternall damnation (without hartie repen|tance and amendment) to his &s;oul.</P>
<P>What profiteth a man by deceit, for&s;wear|ing, and di&s;simulation? he heapeth to him&s;elfe the horrible vengeance of God? and &s;eruantes who &s;hall &s;erue him the like; and offereth his &s;oul as a pray vnto Sathan.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="37">
<P>What auayleth it a man to fare delicately, &amp; to drinke much of plea&s;ant &amp; &s;trong drinks? His mouth receaueth twi&s;e &s;o much bitterne&s;&s;e as it had before delight; he &s;hall become cor|rupt as the Tode, and &s;hall returne to vomite with the dogge.</P>
<P>What getteth a man by lying? Not to be beleeued when he &s;peaketh truth.</P>
<P>Feare God: for he can de&s;troy both thy bo|die and &s;oule.</P>
<P>Honor thy Prince: for &s;he hath power ouer life and death.</P>
<P>Loue thy parents: for they are the be&s;t frie~ds thou &s;halt euer haue.</P>
<P>Giue reuerence to thy betters: for therein thou &s;halt haue honor to thy &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Be curteous and lowly to all men: for there|by thine enemies report &s;halbe doubted of.</P>
<P>Be not wi&s;e in thine owne conceipt: for thou can&s;t not know all thine owne imperfections.</P>
<P>Be not carefull to plea&s;e thine eye: for it is the deceiptfulle&s;t enemie thou ha&s;t.</P>
<P>Remember who made thee: it was God: remember of what thou wa&s;t made: euen of earth and clay. Remember wherfore thou wa&s;t made: to honor and glorifie God. Remember to what thou &s;halt be made: euen to du&s;t and a&s;hes. Remember to what thou may&s;t be made againe: euen a glorious and immortall bodie.</P>
<P>Who &s;o taketh vpon him the degree of a
<PB N="65" REF="37"> &s;eruant, let the&s;e three things be his chiefe&s;t thought and meditation. The fir&s;t that euerie morning and euening, he performe his dutifull obedience and thanke&s;giuing, by his prayers vnto God. The Second, that he alwayes carie in mind, what carefulne&s;&s;e, truth, and diligence, is required in his &s;eruice towards his mai&s;ter. The third, how he him&s;elfe may liue with ho|ne&s;tie and credit in time to come.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="fable">
<HEAD>THE CONCLVSION, VVHICH is an hi&s;torie very profitable and delightful for a youth to reade and meditate.</HEAD>
<P>THere was a certaine Philo&s;opher, who lying on his death bed, called his &s;onne, &amp; &s;ayd the&s;e words vnto him. My &s;onne when I thy father am dead, remember me by recomp|ting often vnto thy &s;elfe this coun&s;ell which now I giue vnto thee. Fir&s;t learne of the little &s;inging birds, who neuer mi&s;&s;e in the morning and at euening, but in their kinde, they yeeld foorth their voices in prai&s;e and reioycing of their Creator and maker: and &s;o &s;ee that thou al&s;o do neuer forget &amp; neglect the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Learne of the litle emet, that prouideth in the &s;ommer her foode for the winter: and &s;o &s;ee that thou al&s;o in thy youth, labor for thy main|tenance again&s;t thine age. Learne of the cocke, that often watcheth and croweth in the night,
<PB N="66" REF="38"> both to pre&s;erue him&s;elf and his fellowes from the wefell: and &s;o &s;e that thou often watch, and &s;tretch forth thy voice in prayer by night vnto God, and in that quiet time, &s;tudie to preue~t thy dangers. Learne of the litle dog, who becau&s;e he is the humble&s;t creature of all vnto man, is therfore mo&s;t loued and e&s;teemed: &amp; &s;o &s;ee that thou euermore &s;hew thy &s;elfe humble &amp; lowly vnto euery man. Learne of the &s;ilk worm, who as &s;oone as &s;he gathereth &s;trength to yeeld anie vertue fro~ her, neuer cea&s;&s;eth nor waxeth wea|rie vntill &s;he die: and &s;o &s;ee that thou al&s;o conte~t not thy &s;elf, to do thy duty to God and man for a time, (as mo&s;t men do) but &s;till continue in vertue till thy verie liues end.</P>
<P>Thus my &s;onne (quoth he) if thou wilt obey this my coun&s;ell, it &s;hall alwayes go well with thee: but contrariwi&s;e if thou for&s;ake it, &amp; fol|low thine owne imaginations, it will happen vnto thee according to this example. There dwelt by a fore&s;t &s;ide a &s;hepheard, who to pre|&s;erue his &s;heepe from a lion, which oftentimes had caried them away for a pray to his whelp, prepared many &s;nares and engines to de&s;troy this lion: but the old lio~ perceauing the&s;e traps to be layd for him, departed with his yong one to another forre&s;t. But when the whelp grewe to be as big a lion as his father, he thus &s;aith vn|to him: Father me thinks I can remember that this place is not the cuntrey where I was born,
<PB N="67" REF="38"> what then was the cau&s;e that made thee to de|part there hence? Saith the old lion, my &s;onne it is not indeed our natiue cuntrey: but there is a litle dwarf a man dwelling in that place, who~ for his &s;ubtle traps that he laid to take from me my life, I feared, and &s;o fled therehence. Saith the yong lion: and I &s;weare by my beard that I will be reuenged of him, and will go now and teare him in peeces with my teeth. Nay (&s;ayth the old lion) do not &s;o, for if I my &s;elf could not po&s;&s;ibly get reue~ge again&s;t him, thou can&s;t not in any &s;ort do it. But the yong lion would not be ruled by his father, but goeth vnto this fore&s;t where the &s;hepheard dwelt: who finding him within his hou&s;e &amp; the dores &s;hut, called vnto him and &s;ayd, &ocirc; thou naughtie &amp; vile wretch, why ha&s;t thou &s;o abu&s;ed my father, as to driue him from his natiue cuntrey, ouer which &amp; all the bea&s;ts therof, he raigned as king: I tell thee that I his &s;onne wilbe reuenged of thee for ma|king him &s;o to loo&s;e his right. The man being within his hou&s;e &s;toutly an&s;wered: I regard not a ru&s;h either thee or thy father, but if thou once offer to enter within my doores, I haue here both my &s;taffe and my axe to beate and to cut thee in peeces. The yong lion was &s;traight wayes amazed at his &s;tout wordes, and &s;ayde: then come thou forth, and go with me to yon|der moyle, and let him be iudge betwixt thee &amp; me, whether thou ha&s;t done my father wro~g or not, Saith the &s;hepheard: if thou wilt adiure
<PB N="68" REF="39"> and &s;weare to do me no harme, I will go with thee. So the yong lion &s;ware vnto him to doe him no harme. The man then leadeth the way vnto the lion, by tho&s;e engins that he had pre|pared long before: and anon the yong lion fell into one of his pits, and was entangled by his 2 forefeet. O (&s;aith the lion) helpe me, for I know not what is this that hath bound my feete verie fa&s;t together. Saith the &s;hepheard, I am not able to helpe thee, but tary thou here, and I will go and call hither the moile. But the lion as well as he could, did yet get forth of the pit, &amp; went iumping and leaping to follow after the man. By and by againe he fel into another pit, wher|by his two hinder leggs were al&s;o caught fa&s;t. The &s;hepheard now &s;eeing him well tyed and bound: he then cutteth with his knife a good greene &s;taffe, &amp; beginneth to lay blows &s;tro~gly vpon the lion. The lion then remembred his father, and &s;aid to the man: &ocirc; beat me not on my back nor my belly, but rather beat me on mine eares &amp; on my heart: becau&s;e with mine eares I would not heare the coun&s;el of my father, nor with my heart would not beleeue it, when he &s;aid thou had&s;t more &s;ubtlety to preuaile, then I had &s;trength. So the man beat him &s;o long, both on the eares and the heart, that in the end he killed him. Euen &s;o (&s;aith the Philo&s;opher to his &s;onne) will de&s;tructio~ come vpon tho&s;e which &s;hall not accept &amp; obey the good coun|&s;ell and in&s;tructions of their aged fathers.</P>
