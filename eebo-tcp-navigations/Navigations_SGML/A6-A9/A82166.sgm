<HEAD>The DECLARATION Of the HOLLANDERS Concerning The Engli&s;h Fleet, and the States Proclamation prohibi|ting Merchants and Sea-men to touch upon the Coa&s;ts of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe States of Holland find the people here to be &s;o importunate and clamorous, and in e&s;peciall manner the Zealanders, (who as if they were in a frenzy, talk high and rave) that they have been forced to publi&s;h in print the in&s;tructions which they gave to the Lord Hem&s;tead at his departure for England, (by which
<PB N="4" REF="3">we &s;uppo&s;e our Emba&s;&s;adours are near home) he was principally to demand of the Parl. of England four con|ferences; therein, To excu&s;e the carriage of Admiral Vantrump towards the Engli&s;h Fleet upon the Downs, to de&s;ire a ce&s;&s;ation of all acts of ho&s;tility, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a re&s;taura|tion of all the &s;hips taken by the Engli&s;h, and to bring the final an&s;wer and demands of the Parliament, and in ca&s;e of delay upon the fourth conference to return back; this was the &s;um of their in&s;tructions, by which it is plainly apparent, that he wanted power to conclude the Treaty, &s;o that from his return we can gather no hope of peace fora&s;much as he and his fellows have performed their task, in di&s;covering the &s;trength, coun&s;els, and re&s;olutions of England.</P>
<P>The publi&s;hing of the&s;e in&s;tructions, &s;eemed for the pre&s;ent to give &s;om &s;mall content to the people, allaying, but not extirpating their fury, which now boils in their brea&s;ts more then before, in&s;omuch that nothing will now content them but a war with England, e&s;pecially the Zealanders, who ever were, and &s;till are more violent then the others. Their rage is come to &s;o high a pitch, that they openly declare, that if their Deputies at the Hague return home, without letters of Mart for them again&s;t the Engli&s;h, they will kill them: the effects of their rage be|gins to break forth already; for as certain Officers went about in Middleburgh beating of drums for &s;ouldiers in the name of the States of Holland and Zealand, becau&s;e the Prince of Orange was not al&s;o named, a great tumult a ro&s;e among the people, who laid violent hands upon the officers and drummers, and threw them into the water.</P>
<P>The Yonckers (alias Gent.) vapour much, and &s;eem to &s;et light by the power of the Engli&s;h at &s;ea, and have de|clared, <HI>That they have not yet &s;hewed how formidable they are, becau&s;e they judge the Engli&s;h Fleet at &s;ea to be of &s;mall
<PB N="5" REF="3">force and &s;carce worth the regarding; but yet if they conti|nue to take and &s;eize their &s;hips as now of late they have done, they will ri&s;e up with all their power, and &s;ink, burn, and de&s;troy them every one.</HI> This is their dayly talk, al|though they know, that if they had not had the help of the Engli&s;h, they had been long ago &s;wallowed up by their enemies.</P>
<P>The States in the mean while, are not in&s;en&s;ible of the danger approaching near them, as appears by their forti|fying of Scheveling, and many other places and building of forts round about them, to hin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">er and impede the lan|ding of the Engli&s;h, in ca&s;e they &s;hould prevail again&s;t their Fleet, and beat them; and to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">cure the Hague, which is defended with nothing but a graft and draw bridge. The Elector of Brandenburgh hath promi&s;ed to aid them with ten thou&s;and men, although I believe he will hardly make good his promi&s;e, which &s;prung onely out of a Bravado, by the per&s;wa&s;ions either of the old Prince&s;s of Orange, his mother in law, or Count William his brother in law; his &s;mall feats the la&s;t &s;ummer again&s;t the Duke of New|burgh di&s;covers of what temper he is.</P>
<P>The States have publi&s;hed a Proclamation throughout all the Cities in Holland, wherein they prohibit all Mer|chants and &s;ea-men who&s;e trade lies We&s;t-ward, to pa&s;&s;e any more by the Cliffs of Dover and Callis; but to leave that narrow Channel where they mu&s;t needs be in dan|ger of &s;hips, Ports and Ca&s;tles, and &s;o to &s;teer about the Orkneys, not touching (if they can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it) any of the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts. But this is a very uncouth &amp; far fetcht pa&s;&s;age, which our men who have ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s and convenience of your Harbours, are very &s;en&s;ible of.</P>
<P>Vantrump is out at &s;ea with three &s;quadrons of &s;hips con&s;i&s;ting of about 70 &s;ail, which are to &s;ecure our Coa&s;t and trade with the fi&s;hing, if there be occa&s;ion; be&s;ides he
<PB N="6" REF="4">hath 24 &s;hips which attend upon the Ea&s;t-India Fleet, all which, together with &s;uch as are c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ming to him are 107 &s;ail, be&s;ides fire &s;hips, among&s;t whom he hath given this order, That in ca&s;e any one be attacht, and that the next might have relieved him and did not, that offendour &s;hall die without mercy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t, I gave you a full account of all our trea|ty in Kerry, with the Lord Muskerry and his party; &s;ince which I returned into the County of Cork, to &s;end all requi&s;ites to our forces in Kerry for reduction of Ro&s;s, and to attend the Rebels in tho&s;e Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, where they had &s;ix hundred hor&s;e, one Regiment of Dragoons, and one of Foot embodied, and every day fre&s;h forces marching to joyn with them. This made me la&s;t Satur|day night with five good troops of Hor&s;e, and five foot companies march towards them, re&s;olving to engage them in their Camp, if providence &s;hould not offer a more promi&s;ing place to do it in. The la&s;t Sabbath in the morning, under the favour of a mi&s;t, after 22 miles march, we fell into their Camp, where the Lord owned us, and by us di&s;per&s;ed all their force; but our men were &s;o tyred, the countrey &s;o bad, and the fog &s;o thick, that the execution was followed above two miles, yet it was not bloudy; they lo&s;t Mr. Herbert of hor&s;e, and others:
<PB N="7" REF="4">We took near 100 hor&s;e, two Colors, and a good quan|tity of arms, a prey of above 200 Beeves they had taken out of our quarters to &s;upply Ro&s;s with, which were re|turned freely to the Country people. We took Lievt. Col. <HI>Supple,</HI> one of their three Commanders in chief; a col. of hor&s;e, and &s;ome troopers, this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Lord Muskerry will probably re&s;tore this mi&s;erable country to peace: We have now received letters that Slego is &s;ur|rendred to Sir Charls Coot, and that Clenrickard de&s;ires &s;ome terms for him&s;elf and party. Al&s;o we have letters that Col. Ingoldsby, hath routed Col. Graces hor&s;e, and &s;urrounded his foot in a Bog.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE hear that Col. Ingoldsby hath lighted on Gra|ces party in a great Fa&s;tne&s;s, after he was beaten of from Lougreah, which he attempted to &s;torm, but mi&s;|&s;ed, and lo&s;t there about 80 men, Col. Ingoldsbies men di&s;puted the pa&s;&s;e into the Fa&s;tne&s;s near half an hour which was ju&s;tified with 1200 foot, and 150 hor&s;e of the enemies, but at length forced them, and killed up|wards of 200, about 60 hor&s;e taken. Grace fled over the Shanon, Collonel Redman Seark, and Collonel Mac Gawley are killed, and &s;ome other field officers, be&s;ides &s;ixe or &s;even Captains, &s;ome few pri&s;oners were taken, which are with Collonel Abbot to exchange, we lo&s;t but three men that we can hear of, and nine Dragoons woun|ded, with &s;ome few Troopers. It is hoped 1500 Iri&s;h will be &s;hipt for Spain.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In my la&s;t I acquainted you with the affairs here, and that an act of union was agreed upon between the Princes, Parliament, and City, again&s;t the Cardinal and his adherents, and con&s;equently again&s;t the King, It is now &s;igned by all parties, and they have proceeded already to change many officers of State who favoured Mazarine, placing others of their own faction in their rooms, they are now about to make the Duke of Orleans Regent of the Kingdome, as &s;oon as the Deputies of this Parliament are returned from the Court. All the great officers of the City are fled in much fear, (being Mazarini&s;ts) to the Court; the King and Cardinal &s;eem not to be greatly mo|ved at the&s;e things, but proceed to re-inforce their army which is much augmented by the addition of 3000 men under Gen. Ro&s;a, who hath united him&s;elf to Mar&s;hal Thuren. It is reported that &s;ome eminent per&s;ons have been executed at St. Dennis by the Kings command, who with the advice of his Councel hath pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence, de|claring the City of Parts, and all others that &s;hall adhere unto the Princes, Rebels and Traitors, and &s;till keepeth all provi&s;ions from comming to the City, &s;o that bread is exce&s;&s;ive dear, but the Duke is providing 4000 hor&s;e to be a guard for provi&s;ions, that &s;o the wants of the City may be &s;upplied.</P>
