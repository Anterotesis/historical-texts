<P>_THe mutuall complaints of the <HI>Turky Company</HI> and S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> late Emba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Turky,</HI> being eminently publique; and many &s;candals being ca&s;t upon the Merchants, and upon the pre&s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador, by private whi&s;pers of S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> and his Agents: It is become even nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e the following papers to publique view; being the copies of S^r <HI>Sac. Crowes Warrants, In&s;tructions</HI> and <HI>Letters</HI> to his Agents, and of &s;ome of their <HI>Returnes:</HI> together with the <HI>Factors letters</HI> unto the Company here; giving an account of his attempts again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And who&s;oever &s;hall e&s;teeme it worth his time to be truly informed of the matters in difference, as they depended before the late, and this pre&s;ent Parliament; may collect from the&s;e Papers, the true &s;tate of the controver&s;ie: The mo&s;t materiall of which are confe&s;|&s;ed by S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> before a Committee of Parlia|ment, to have pa&s;&s;ed under his own hand and Seale; and the others al&s;o will be as ea&s;ily proved.</P>
<P>But be plea&s;ed fir&s;t to under&s;tand the relation be|tween the <HI>Levant</HI> (or <HI>Turky</HI>) Company and S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow.</HI> He was fir&s;t employed in the yeare 1638. as Emba&s;&s;ador or Agent to Con&s;tantinople: and although he was dignified (as was u&s;ual) with the title of the Kings Emba&s;&s;ador or Re&s;ident, and his Commi&s;&s;ion; yet it was not an Emba&s;&s;y upon matters of State, there being only Capitulations and peace for freedom of Trade between the Turkes and the Engli&s;h; and S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> under that honorable name, was the Levant Com|panies Agent or publique Mini&s;ter, upon &s;everall agree|ments and covenants mutually pa&s;&s;ed between them:
<PB REF="3"> and as Their Agent only, the Company paid for the tran&s;portation and provi&s;ion of him&s;elfe, his <HI>Lady,</HI> and all his retinue: and al&s;o gave him Sixe hundred pounds as advance, for the furniture and ornament of his hou&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> and covenanted to allow him a year|ly Salary of neere Two thou&s;and five hundred pounds &s;terling; which was paid him quarterly beforehand. And He covenanted <HI>to take care of the publique good of the Companies trade,</HI> and impartially <HI>to &s;ee it ordered by the rules and orders made by them:</HI> and <HI>to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Trea&s;urer to cau&s;e the co&s;ts and charges of any Avania,</HI> (or Turki&s;h charge upon fictitious pretences) <HI>that &s;hould happen upon a Nationall cau&s;e, to be borne by all the Company of Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rs there, in indifferent proportions, as their Trea&s;urer and the Engli&s;h nation there &s;hould thinke fit:</HI> and <HI>that he &s;hould not exact any Levy of moneys, or forcibly take the goods or moneys of any of the Traders there, upon any pretence what|&s;oever without the Companies order under Seale.</HI> This was the &s;umme and &s;ub&s;tance of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed by the Company in S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> (with &s;ome other things le&s;s materiall) to which he was obliged by Articles under his hand and &s;eale.</P>
<P>Now the mo&s;t gro&s;s, palpable and infamous breach of this publique tru&s;t, to the high di&s;honour of the En|gli&s;h nation in the eyes of Turkes and Infidels, and to the utmo&s;t hazard of the lo&s;s and ruine of a very im|portant part of the Engli&s;h Trade, and of the lives and fortunes of many of the Engli&s;h Nation, This is the &s;ubject matter of the Levant Companies complaint again&s;t S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow:</HI> and the following Papers &s;peak enough to be &s;ufficient proof on their behalfe: from the&s;e every judicious eye may collect cleere evidence, that S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> did not only ca&s;t a&s;ide <HI>that care of the publique good of the Companies trade, and ob&s;erving their
<PB REF="3"> rules and orders,</HI> unto which he was obliged by Covenant; But al&s;o that he a&s;&s;umed and u&s;urped to him&s;elfe an ab&s;olute arbitrary power over all the Companies E&s;tates in Turky, and their Factors Per&s;ons; and to be their ab&s;olute and &s;upreme Judge even in his own ca&s;e; and that he demeaned him&s;elfe, as if he had been ab&s;ol|ved from all his Covenants; pur&s;uing by all undue meanes of force and fraud his private intere&s;t, to the ruine of the Trade. And to make the&s;e Papers &s;peake in method and order, be plea&s;ed (good Reader) to ob|&s;erve from them,</P>

And the Reader may ob&s;erve in &s;everall pa&s;&s;ages<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">22. 24. 83.</NOTE> how highly S^r <HI>Sack|vile</HI> was inraged at the &s;tealing any Engli&s;h goods aboard, or the departure of any &s;hip: He e&s;teeming it all to be lo&s;t out of his pur&s;e; having &s;wallowed in his hopes the whole Engli&s;h e&s;tate in that Empire. And he was &s;o confident in the face of the Sun to avow <HI>the making him&s;elfe a fortune</HI> upon the Companies e&s;tates there (for that was his &s;ole, and utmo&s;t end what ever may now be &s;ugge&s;ted)<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">6. 7. 8. 74. 80. 81.</NOTE> That he demanded of the Fa|ctors at once, <HI>Twenty five thou&s;and pounds</HI> Sterling, for his E&s;tate which he &s;aid was &s;eque&s;tred in England; and neere <HI>Ten thou&s;and pounds</HI> Sterling for his hopes of future profits by his Emba&s;&s;y for &s;even years: and tells them that <HI>untill they had paid it him, neither their Per&s;ons nor E&s;tates &s;hould be free; for he had vowed to God at the la&s;t Sacrament to &s;acrifice his E&s;tate, Him&s;elfe, Wife and Children, for the execution of this his ab&s;olute intent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly, the&s;e following Papers will &s;hew the <HI>Di&s;gui&s;es</HI> which S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> invented and practi|&s;ed, for the more plau&s;ible carrying on this his grand and black De&s;igne. Fir&s;t, he impo&s;ed a <HI>Leviation</HI> or taxe upon the Engli&s;h E&s;tates, of <HI>a Hundred and ten thou&s;and Dollars;</HI> under colour of a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o much to &s;atisfy the Companies debts: Requiring the &s;ame to be paid in <HI>ready money,</HI> when he told his Agents<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">15. 16.</NOTE> he knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible; whom yet he in&s;tructed <HI>to take no &s;ecurity,</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> <HI>no not all the Nation for one mans taxe:</HI> Nei|ther would he allow any time, when the Factors would &s;ubmit to his Leviation, if they might have time to rai&s;e the money: But in pur&s;uance of his &s;ecret De&s;igne, he gives out Warrants and In&s;tructions to <HI>Enter Warehou&s;es and Comptinghou&s;es, and &s;eize upon all Goods, Money and Mer|chandizes;</HI> that thereby he might not only have occa|&s;ion
<PB REF="5"> to begin to rifle the Engli&s;h E&s;tates, but to <HI>Di&s;cover</HI> them; and this with le&s;s odium and &s;candall from the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Iewes,</HI> and with more a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> officers, then would have bin, if his &s;ecret De|&s;igne had been fallen upon bare-faced. Yet to make it beyond di&s;pute, that This was only intended in order to the de&s;igne of &s;wallowing up all; The Reader may plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that this Leviation was and is by S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> him&s;elfe acknowledged to be a<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">15. 16. 16. 18. 19. 47. 48.</NOTE> Colour: His Agents being ordered<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE> to make that the ground|worke of all their other worke; and<NOTE N="&s;" PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE> not to di&s;cover his owne pretences till the la&s;t. As al&s;o that &s;ome of the Factors, hoping to prevent his further oppre&s;&s;ion, made tender of their part of the Leviation in money to S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> him&s;elfe; and he refu&s;ed it, and gave order to his Agents at Smyrna,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE> <HI>to arre&s;t the per&s;on and goods of</HI> Mr. Daniell Edwards, <HI>that offered it, notwith&s;tan|ding his tender of his money;</HI> and &s;aid <HI>he longed to have him in his power.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Brandon,</HI> another of the Factors, offering likewi&s;e his part, S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> refu|&s;ed it, unle&s;s he would di&s;cover where all his E&s;tate re|mained; which M^r <HI>Brandon</HI> denying, S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> &s;ends for his Broker, commanding a di&s;covery from him, as al&s;o from M^r <HI>James Mudiford:</HI> But they &s;till refu&s;ing, S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> vowed that if it were between Heaven and Earth he would find it out: &amp; thereupon, on S^r <HI>Sackviles</HI> command, M^r <HI>Brandon</HI> was clapt in Chaines. Nay<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">30. 34.</NOTE> <HI>the full of the Leviation would not be accepted:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">40. 48.</NOTE> Nor being paid, might the Factors be afterwards at liberty to lade their goods; But<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">29. 30.</NOTE> &s;till his in&s;truments are directed to &s;eize. And this fir&s;t di&s;gui&s;e of a Leviation, carried Two more in his bowels; The one was, a &s;eizure of more goods for charges, when they had enough double and treble for the Leviation; and tho&s;e he &s;et at 36000
<PB REF="5"> Dollars: The other was to apprai&s;e the goods his A|gents &s;hould Seize, at halfe values; That when his new pretences for his &s;ecret De&s;igne &s;hould come, he might not want colour for &s;wallowing up the whole.</P>
<P>The next maske of his de&s;igne was a meere fained pretence<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Page 7</NOTE> that the Parliament had &s;eque&s;tred his E&s;tate in England, by the companies procurement; and therefore He would repaire him&s;elfe out of theirs in Turky: and then he values his E&s;tate at 297000 Dol|lars (neere 80000 pound &s;terling) whereas it is belei|ved that he had not a vi&s;ible E&s;tate to 3000 pound Value.</P>
<P>An other pretence was,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">6. 7 29.</NOTE> a claime of 174000 Dol|lars for Con&s;ulage due to him; although he had con|tracted under hand and Seale with the Company <HI>to a&s;si&s;t in collecting that money for Them, to be paid to Their Trea&s;urer;</HI> That being the u&s;uall Receipt out of which the Com|pany defray the extraordinary Charge of the Emba&s;&s;a|dor and other Mini&s;ters abroad. But as he in&s;tructed his &s;ervants about the &s;eizing &s;ome of the Factors per|&s;ons,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">50. 51.</NOTE> <HI>to Make a pretence, if they could not find one, for</HI> (he &s;aid) <HI>it was all one to him,</HI> &s;o the worke were done; So he practi&s;eth him&s;elfe to forge and invent pretences to devoure the Companies E&s;tates; that his rapine and violence might not be &s;eene unmasked, lea&s;t they &s;hould have lo&s;t the opportunity to act it.</P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly, Let the Reader ob&s;erve from the&s;e papers what unhappy Meanes, &s;uitable to his Ends, he found out for compa&s;&s;ing his de&s;igne.</P>
<P N="1">1. By fal&s;e in&s;inuations to the Vizier, he procures countenance from him for an Embargo: And there|upon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1. 4. 11. 23. 26. 39. 41. 45.</NOTE> <HI>he arre&s;ts all the &s;hips of the Engli&s;h at Smirna and Con&s;tantinople; and prohibites al&s;o the Lading of any goods; and commands the per&s;ons of any that &s;hould pre&s;ume to lade,
<PB REF="6"> to be arre&s;ted; and tho&s;e that could not be apprehended, to be proclaimed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">26. 35. 69.</NOTE> <HI>Rebells: and</HI> &s;o he afterwardes &s;tyled mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h Nation there. And he further com|mands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">44. 45. 46.</NOTE> <HI>Accounts to be given to his Agents by the Ma&s;ters of the &s;hips, of all the goods on board; and they to enter into all Ships, Warehou&s;es or Counting hou&s;es; and to take into their power all Bookes of Accompts, Bills of Debt, Acquittan|ces, Letters, or other writings or evidence what&s;oever belon|ging to any Engli&s;h what&s;oever; and the &s;ame to keepe and and make u&s;e of in evidence.</HI> Thus under<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Page 31. 33. 35.</NOTE> a feyned Co|lour of command from that State, he practi&s;ed to im|mure the whole Engli&s;h E&s;tate, that none might e&s;cape his fingers.</P>
<P N="2">2. He ordered Rewards and promi&s;es to be made and given to Informers (without re&s;erving his Agents within any bounds) that they might di&s;cover the mo|neys, goods and debts of the Company. And<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Page 16.</NOTE> He orders his &s;ervants <HI>to employ &s;ome Jew or Armenian Brokers (under pretence of Bargains) to di&s;cover the Engli&s;h E&s;tates:</HI> And his Agents<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Page 58.</NOTE> make him returne to the&s;e In&s;tructions, <HI>That they had employed the mo&s;t cunning Rogues in all the Countrey, to &s;ee if they could di&s;cover any other part of the Nations E&s;tate either hid or lying out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He ordered<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Page 10. 18. 20. 32. 35. 36. 41. 50.</NOTE> the Bribing of the <HI>Cady,</HI> the <HI>Neipe,</HI> the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> the <HI>Cu&s;tomer,</HI> and all the Turki&s;h officers and in|ferior mini&s;ters, to gaine their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his de&s;igne: and herein he gives his Agents<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Page 21.</NOTE> <HI>Latitude without limit;</HI> and tells them againe and againe<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Page 10. 18. 19. 20. 41.</NOTE> <HI>That they mu&s;t &s;pare no Co&s;t;</HI> a&s;&s;uring them <HI>they may charge</HI> 10000 <HI>Dollars upon him by bills for that u&s;e,</HI> and commands them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Page 52. 54.</NOTE> to <HI>pawne</HI> the goods they &s;eaze, for the &s;ame end; That they might buy the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters to execute his cruelty upon the Factors, and helpe to po&s;&s;e&s;s him of the companies E&s;tate. And to make his Agents mo&s;t impudent and
<PB REF="6"> fearle&s;s in what they did, he gives them a&s;&s;urance in a boa&s;ting manner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Page 38.</NOTE> That the <HI>Merchants &s;hould never have right again&s;t them, &s;o long as they them&s;elves had any thing to bribe the contrary:</HI> and he bad them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Page 53.</NOTE> <HI>Value them&s;elves and their &s;ervice at what rate they plea&s;ed, and they &s;hould be recompen&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. He ordered his Servants to ingratiate them&s;elves with all the Turkes; who were apt to mutiny by &s;ee|ing the horrid rapine and inju&s;tice executed upon the traders with whom they dealt: and therefore he com|manded them to <HI>&s;pare no charge</HI> in pre&s;ents,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Page 18. 40. 63.</NOTE> to make the very Town&s;men of their party; and to per&s;wade them <HI>that all that was done, was intended for the better regulation and advance of Trade;</HI> which he &s;aid was only in his power to increa&s;e and regulate.</P>
<P N="5">5. And yet to Secure him&s;elfe of the whole Engli&s;h E&s;tate more certainly, he tooke care to prevent the interpo&s;ition of the ju&s;tice of the very Infidells, which he feared might protect the Merchants from his oppre&s;|&s;ion: Therefore he informed the Vizier,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Page 26.</NOTE> that divers Engli&s;h &s;hips were joyned with the Venetian Fleet, the Turkes Enemy, and attended to give Battle to the Grand Signiors Fleete: and al&s;o<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Page 82.</NOTE> that &s;ome &s;hips had been Laden by the Merchants with Powder and prohibited goods, for the Enemies &s;upplies: And<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Page 69.</NOTE> coun&s;ells his Servants at Smirna to procure from the Turki&s;h Mini&s;ters there, mo&s;t dangerous and fal&s;e Cer|tificates, <HI>That the Factors per&s;waded the people of the place to mutinie:</HI> By this meanes expo&s;ing the Factors per|&s;ons at lea&s;t to Slavery in the Gallies, if not death by Torments, and the Companies E&s;tates to a certaine confi&s;cation; if the Vizier him&s;elfe had not di&s;cerned his fal&s;ene&s;s and Avanious de&s;ignes again&s;t his own Nation.

<PB REF="7"> yet, by them he ob&s;tructed, at lea&s;t for a time, the only meanes of releife which the factors could expect; hoping in the interim to make &s;ure of mo&s;t of their E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus He that was employed and tru&s;ted cheifely (as occa&s;ion &s;hould happen) to mediate with the Grand Signor and his Mini&s;ters that the Capitulations be|tween him and the Engli&s;h might be kept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Capitula|tions.

<P N="4">IV. Fourthly, The&s;e papers will give you an account what <HI>progre&s;&s;e</HI> S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> made in the <HI>Execution</HI> of his intended rapine.</P>
<P N="1">1. His Orders for arre&s;ting the Ships in port, tooke &s;uch unhappy effect, by his &s;ubtilty in gaining Impe|riall Commands upon fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 78.</NOTE> that &s;ome &s;hips were &s;tayed in port neare 7 moneths; to an in&s;uppor|table damage of the Merchants.</P>
<P N="2">2. He actually<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">.</NOTE> forced the payment of 110000 Dollars, under colour of a Leviation: and al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 80</NOTE> Bonds for 25000 Dollars, under colour of maintenance for him&s;elfe and his family.</P>
<P N="3">3. His Servants prevailed &s;o effectually with the Turki&s;h officers, That * they &s;eized and impri&s;oned, fir&s;t the Con&s;ul and mo&s;t principall of the Factors at
<PB REF="7"> Smirna; and afterwards mo&s;t of the re&s;t: and with Bar|barous cruelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 91.</NOTE> haled the Con&s;ul and Sixe of the cheife of that factory to a darke and clo&s;e Dungeon, with the doores and windowes nailed upon them, in the extreame heate of Summer: Where they had in probability peri&s;hed, if the mercy of the Turkes had not been prevailed upon with a bribe of 100 Dollars, to exceed the mercy of S^r <HI>Sackviles</HI> Servants, and to open a window for light and ayre. And at the &s;ame time they forced away from the Con&s;ul there the Imperiall Capitulations, which were the only &s;ecurity of the Engli&s;h again&s;t Death or Slavery by the Turkes. And within a few daies they hurried their Pri&s;oners with Turki&s;h guards 350 miles overland to Con&s;tantinople, to impri&s;on them in S^r <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> owne Hou&s;e: Many of their fellow Factors being &s;oone after brought in like manner to partake of the &s;ame bondage. And what he acted by his cruel Agents at Smirna, He him|&s;elfe undertooke to execute upon the Factory at Con|&s;tantinople; where taking the opportunity of a Gene|rall Court or meeting of the Nation; He cau&s;ed the Gates to be &s;hut, and by &s;urpri&s;e tooke them all his Pri&s;oners; and &s;et &s;trong guards upon them, to prevent all acce&s;&s;e to them, and their &s;ending the lea&s;t paper abroad; &s;ome of them al&s;o being clapt in Chaines.</P>
<P N="4">4. He cau&s;ed the Counting hou&s;es, Warehou&s;es and Chambers of the Engli&s;h at Con&s;tantinople, to be &s;ei|zed and &s;ealed up. And his &s;ervants Hetherington and Zuma did the &s;ame to the whole Engli&s;h Nation at Smirna; and proceeded al&s;o to breake open and ran|&s;ake all their Chambers, Trunkes and Counting hou&s;es; and to plunder and carry away unto Turki&s;h Canes, all money, goods, faculties and effects what&s;oever they could find, either at home or abroad: Expo&s;ing their
<PB REF="8"> Servants and Families to the mercy of the Infidells for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 83.</NOTE>5. He breathed forth mo&s;t &s;evere threats and me|naces by his Agents, again&s;t the Servants and families of the Factors, to extort from them di&s;covery and con|fe&s;&s;ion of their Ma&s;ters E&s;tates and debts, and for deli|very of their Bookes; intending to devoure the whole: and the dread of the Turki&s;h Souldiers and Officers (who&s;e tiranny was &s;o higly menaced) &s;o affrighted the Factors Servants, that they fled to &s;hips for refuge; leaving the plundered Hou&s;es to the open world.</P>
<P>Thus the Reader will find S^r <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> Cruelty and vigor in Executing, to be no le&s;s, then his &s;ubtilty and policy in Contriving his de&s;igne of rapine upon the Companies E&s;tates: and if the outcries and clamors of the Jewes and Turkes again&s;t &s;uch horrid oppre&s;|&s;ions and de&s;tructive cour&s;es to all future Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 82. 93.</NOTE> to|gether with &s;ome Pre&s;ents made to the Vizier by &s;ome few of the factors that fortunately e&s;caped impri&s;on|ment, had not cau&s;ed the Turki&s;h ju&s;tice to interpo&s;e, and redeeme the Merchants E&s;tates, and the Factors per&s;ons from his cruell and covetous hands, his de&s;igne had certainly been fully &s;ucce&s;&s;efull.</P>
<P>Now let the Reader judge whether the Company were not obliged for their owne pre&s;ervation, upon ad|vice of the&s;e horrid attempts of S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> to &s;eeke &s;ome pre&s;ent redre&s;s. And this they did by hum|ble addre&s;&s;es to the late Parliament, who were plea&s;ed to order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P. 95.</NOTE> his Revocation; and by ordinance of Par|liament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P. 97.</NOTE> to authori&s;e S^r <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;he</HI> to be Em|ba&s;&s;ador in S^r <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> &s;tead. Yet when S^r <HI>Tho|mas Bendi&s;he</HI> arrived) S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> contemnes the autho|rity whereby he was &s;ent; and pretends him to be no other then an Impo&s;tor, who had counterfeited Com|mi&s;&s;ions
<PB REF="8"> for an Emba&s;&s;y; although his authority (being both from the King and the Parliament) was as great as ever any Emba&s;&s;ador carried into Turky: and he &s;ecretly in&s;inuated to the Vizier, that the Engli&s;h Nation there were mo&s;t of them Rebells; and S^r <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;he</HI> intended to be their Head: Sugge&s;t|ing al&s;o that he had Letters from the King to the Grand Signor for his owne continuance in the Emba&s;&s;y; hoping to have hindered the reception of S^r <HI>Thomas Bendy&s;he.</HI> But when the fal&s;ehood of his pretences ap|peared to the Vizier, He cau&s;ed his owne officers to &s;end him on board a Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;ell to Smirna, to be from thence &s;hipped for England, to be dealt with ac|cording to his demerits. And upon his arrivall here in <HI>April</HI> 1648,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 99.</NOTE> the Parliament committed him Pri|&s;oner to the Tower of London in order to his Tryall; and referred the Companies Complaints to be exami|ned by the Committie for the Navy: and &s;everall witne&s;&s;es in the ca&s;e were by them examined; although the Report was not made, through the cunning arti|fices of S^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> to delay the full hearing of the Cau&s;e. But it is humbly &s;ubmitted to every ingenuous Reader, whether there was not cau&s;e &s;ufficient to &s;end home S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow:</HI> and whether S <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;he</HI> was not obliged in faithfuln&s;&s;e to his tru&s;t, to proceed as he did, in order to the performing his owne Emba&s;|&s;y: And whether the hand of Ju&s;tice might not have fallen heavy upon S^r <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> if there had been that vigorous pro&s;ecution which the blackne&s;&s;e of his de&s;ignes again&s;t the Company might have provoked them unto. Yet if S^r <HI>Sackvile</HI> had not by private in|formations, and by pamplets (in a very &s;ecret and un|ingenuous way di&s;per&s;ed) lately endeavoured to bla&s;t the Companies and the Emba&s;&s;adors reputation; and
<PB REF="9"> al&s;o to have in&s;inuated mo&s;t fal&s;e complaints of great injuries done to him by the Company; and if he had not commenced vexatious Suites at Law again&s;t them, upon hopes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">dvantage by the patience and forbea|rance they have &s;hewed towards him: The&s;e his crimes had not been made thus publique; being done without thought of Malice or prejudice to his per&s;on; and not without greife and &s;hame That one who enjoyed &s;o faire an Income from the Company, and underwent but an ea&s;y Expence, and therefore could not but be ma&s;ter of a very ample E&s;tate; &s;hould thus <HI>betray</HI> them who <HI>intru&s;ted</HI> and <HI>maintained</HI> him; and &s;o wilfully purcha&s;e ruine to him&s;elfe, with the expence of his owne fortunes, and <HI>above one hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> lo&s;s to the Company.</P>

<P N="9">9. I hope the Cu&s;tomer before your arrival will bee a little calmer, then hitherunto hee hath been, and at la&s;t for&s;ake the Merchants part; if not, you &s;hall do well on your fir&s;t arri|vall, as on your old &s;core of friend&s;hip, under colour of a vi&s;it, to make him &s;en&s;ible, not onely of tho&s;e curte&s;ies I have formerly don him, but to let him know how &s;en&s;ible I am of &s;uch his proceedings, and how contrary they are to his pro|mi&s;es and oaths to mee, in ca&s;e I could get him to bee made Cu&s;tomer of that place; at la&s;t, and in extremity, that if hee per&s;i&s;t, you have power &s;ufficient to curb him, or &s;end him to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and &s;ee fir&s;t before you com to action, how that language will work with him.</P>
<P N="10">10. If this take no effect to make him yours, (which I wi&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible) you may tell him, hee can but expect a Cu&s;tom for tho&s;e Goods, which are ready to bee tran&s;ported; and that whether tho&s;e Goods go by the&s;e Ships or Land, hee &s;hall have that, and a pre&s;ent to boot; conditionally hee &s;uffer no Goods to pa&s;s by day or night, but &s;uch as hee &s;hall have your or my allowance and note for, under your hand; where|in if hee will a&s;&s;i&s;t you, that is, to deteign &s;uch Goods as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to attach and arre&s;t; for all &s;uch as you arre&s;t, you have power upon his performance of his part, to give him Bills for, payable by mee to the import of whatever they &s;hall amount unto in Cu&s;tom, together with &s;uch pre&s;ent to him therefore, as you and hee can agree for.</P>
<P N="11">11.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Jo. Hetherington!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this day received Letters from <HI>Smyrna</HI> of the 22. and 25. of <HI>April,</HI> finde thereby that <HI>Porter</HI> was not then de|parted;
<PB N="28" REF="26"> that the <HI>Chouz</HI> with the Druggerman were arrived; that all they or M^r <HI>Lancelot</HI> had done, was by a Letter rather to &s;end him away than &s;ummon him, for ought I can di&s;cern to the contrary: wherein hee had intimated to him the Grand Signor's plea&s;ure and my Order for his &s;tay. In fine a piece of the old &s;tory, others not beeing to bee expected from one &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in the others lading. In conclu&s;ion, I finde <HI>Jorden</HI> come into that Port al&s;o unladed, and to have contra|cted for his lading there, without regard to his promi&s;e or my ingagement for his lading here; and that al&s;o by M^r <HI>Lancelott</HI>'s per&s;wa&s;ions, contrary to the others own re&s;oluti|on, (as his Letter relate's) the meaning whereof can bee no other, than that hee and the Nation have been work|ing, whil'&s;t hee hath endeavoured to make mee believe other|wi&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> the carrying of all out of the Countrey, and de|feating the Leviation, &amp;c. for that's the very language of the Nations meaning, whil'&s;t they de&s;ire 4 moneths time yet for payment, (as tho&s;e that have advice of that re&s;olution pretend and &s;ay); but I have not yet received their general Letter, though divers Copies thereof are come to Town, which is a Riddle al&s;o.</P>
<P>Upon the premi&s;&s;es I &s;hall not finde cau&s;e to alter any part of your In&s;tructions, but &s;econd it in all as well form as mat|ter; <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t to proceed with that bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Porter</HI> and his Laders, to clap them up and make them and their E&s;tates &s;ure, as directed; then to proceed to the Leviation; and af|ter to let the other fall in of cour&s;, and take it's place in time. Only one Caution I &s;hall think good to add, that in ca&s;e there bee not or you cannot get a re&s;olution for the Levia|tion by a general con&s;ent in Court, with a Pawn for pay|ment, in &s;uch manner as is directed; you need not trouble your &s;elf with that, but according to that Li&s;t and Schedule annexed to the Order for Leviation, proceed to a &s;eque&s;tra|tion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every mans particular apart, not regar|ding the Con&s;ent of the whole, by &s;taying or looking to an Act of Court of their a&s;&s;ent there; for you mu&s;t know that this is an Order for execution, and an Act of Ju&s;tice, procee|ding
<PB N="29" REF="26"> from mee as his Maje&s;tie's Commi&s;&s;ioner, and you are to govern your &s;elf accordingly, and as men &s;ent on &s;uch an Errand; and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t to treat or capitulate beyond your I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tructi|ons, and &s;o you are to let tho&s;e people know in occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>M^r <HI>Edwards</HI> hath given order for his part of the Leviation money by M^r <HI>Piggot;</HI> who even now make's tender of it to mee, and happily will think much to bee arre&s;ted for that: But I take no notice of any &s;uch tender to mee in per&s;on; the fir&s;t Order run's for payment into <HI>Cancellaria</HI> by &s;uch a day; your Order goe's for Leviation and Charges for non-payment there; and (believe mee) the Charges of their refu|&s;al at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> mu&s;t bee born by them of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and not by mee or the Nation here. But leaving that di&s;pute a&s;ide, (as a thing by the by) in ca&s;e M^r <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;hould object this as a rea&s;on of his, for avoiding his part of the Charge, or for gi|ving Caution; you may &s;ay that untill it bee certified to you, you can take no notice of it, neither &s;pare him nor any o|ther, but in the mean time are to proceed with him as the o|ther: and over and above, in ca&s;e hee &s;hould (notwith&s;tand|ing that Order of his before mentioned) bee contented yet to give in Caution by Pawn, as others are ordered to do, hee proving faulty in Lading the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> you are to proceed with him according to your In&s;tructions and Com|mand to &s;uch effect; for (I confe&s;s) I long to have him in my power, of all men in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> having &s;uffered by him more than by any one there, except one that you have advice of.</P>
<P>To conclude, taking all you have to do into con&s;iderati|on, I finde you have a difficult part to act, and therefore you are to bee &s;ure to take it by tho&s;e degrees you are directed in, and to be &s;ure to avoid the confounding of one thing with a|nother, and in the la&s;t place to make your demand of Con&s;u|lage, &amp;c. as by your la&s;t Warrant, but not that neither untill further Order, (I mean on the whole Nation).</P>
<P>And touching that, of <HI>Lancelott</HI> and his Companion, to proceed by degrees with them al&s;o, or rather than fail h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e and his Companion coming up (as I pre&s;ume they will, if
<PB N="30" REF="27"> not for the <HI>Leviathan,</HI> for having laded on the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> contrary to order) you may let that pa&s;s till their ar|rival here (having fir&s;t &s;ealed up their Warehou&s;es and count|ing hou&s;es, as directed,) by the by however getting what advice you may touching their carriage of that bu&s;ine&s;s. And whatever you come to di&s;cover, &s;hall act, or do; I pray advi&s;e mee from time to time, &amp; daily, or every two dayes at the fur|the&s;t; for your intelligence will bee the onely rule for my future direction; not having further to add that I can think nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent I re&s;t.</P>

<P>I Have this morning by the Con&s;uls Me&s;&s;enger received the Originall of the nations generall Letter &s;ub&s;cribing to the Leviation, de&s;iring re&s;pite of payment for five moneths time; to which I give that an&s;wer you will finde in the Co|py of mine to the Con&s;ul herewith &s;ent you; by which you will di&s;cern that I &s;till drive the bu&s;ine&s;s to a Caution and pledg; and with all rea&s;on I may demand it, for by that time they may have conveyed away their E&s;tates, or received &s;om other order from <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o fru&s;trate the Leviation totally, &amp; leav &amp; the Nation here under the Debt and ingage|ment; which you may let the Nation know I have no rea&s;on to admit of, and &s;o not to contradict that order I have for|merly &s;ent, which is to demand your Caution for perfor|mance: next (&s;uppo&s;e they would now pay the full, actually in hand to my Druggerman, you are to &s;ay, you have not power to take that neither, without like &s;ecurity for the Charges of their former refu&s;al; which what it is or may bee, by their contra&s;ts en&s;uing, I have not been nor &s;hall bee able to &s;et down in particulars, untill I &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue. Whatever it
<PB N="31" REF="27"> may bee, they may bee &s;ure as I &s;eek noe advantage in that, &s;o I am re&s;olved not to loo&s; by it, and lay money out of my pur&s; for their defaults; So if they con&s;ent on the&s;e terms, give you good caution into your hands, to bee put apart by you into &s;ome place under your power, you may con&s;ent; and having done &s;o expect my further Order thereon: other|wi&s;e you are to proceed without more Ceremony in the way you were fir&s;t directed; And &s;o I once more leav that bu&s;ine&s;s, the rather findeing that the nation here will not bee otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied with their a&s;&s;urance, for ought I can di&s;|cern, by tho&s;e I have hitherunto &s;poken with; re&s;olving to morrow to call a Court, and then I am &s;ure to finde this opi|nion of theirs more confirmed, (as I am &s;ure I mu&s;t) when I &s;hall demand all mine own monies, amounting one way or other to near 30000 dollars, to bee pre&s;ently paid; and to &s;ay truth, I am not re&s;olved to ex&s;pect much longer for it. You will by the inclo&s;ed &s;ee what I write to Captain <HI>Jorden,</HI> and if I might yet expect to finde him other then a Tarpawling, I could wi&s;h hee would yet take in &s;uch goods as might offer them&s;elves at <HI>Smirna</HI> on this occa&s;ion, and come up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> therewith; from whence I would a&s;&s;ure him as good a fraight, as ever hee had, better then hee can expect from any hand in <HI>Turkie</HI> without mee. If you finde him not too much otherwi&s;e ingaged, or changed to be round &s;ince I &s;aw him; you may &s;ound him to that effect, having fir&s;t in your power &s;ufficient to lade him with for this place: If hee refu&s;e it; or accepting, give you not a chearfull a&s;&s;u|rance to comply therein, you are not to &s;uffer him or any other to lade, until further order from the Port and mee; but prote&s;t again&s;t the cu&s;tomer and Merchants whoever till they &s;hall lade on him or the other &s;hip in Port: If on this, for the better di&s;gui&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, hee will bee contented with a Warrant of mine to pre&s;s him to this &s;ervice, you &s;hall have that al&s;o; and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, partly by denying his Lading there, on the one &s;ide; partly by Warrant and Command on the other, hee may &s;eem to bee con&s;trained, and &s;o for avoid|ing of greater Inconveniences, to embrace the of|fer;

<P>I Have &s;een and well weighed what yours of the 12^t^h ad|vi&s;eth, with that of the 13^t^h, which came not to my hands before the arrival of the <HI>Balouke Ba&s;&s;ac,</HI> with the <HI>Chiouz</HI> and their Company; who at their arrival made terrible com|plaints of your &s;evere proceedings with them, e&s;pecially the Con&s;ul, who had prepared a learned Elogie; but I cut him off in the mid&s;t by a &s;hort approval of what you had done, and told them plainly 'twas no more than what I had enordered you, and that if you had done le&s;s, you mu&s;t have &s;een mee no more. I told them I came not hither to bee made a &s;lave for the Companies Debt; I had their Cove|nant to &s;ee that paid by Leviation, and that Leviation agreed by their own, &amp;c. bade them welcom to the trouble of their own procuring, and &s;o left them for that pre&s;ent to a bet|ter con&s;ideration, in the mean time put a guard upon them.</P>
<P>This morning (they having &s;ince <HI>Saturday</HI> had the liberty of my hou&s;, and free conference with all that would come and go) they &s;end mee a reque&s;t as full of humility, as their fir&s;t di&s;cour&s; was of vapour; with promi&s;e to pay in their parts of the Leviation; whereupon they have liberty, with a Druggerman and Janizarie to go among&s;t their Compani|ons at <HI>Gallata,</HI> to gather in their monies, but to return at night: <HI>Lancelott</HI> &s;tayes &s;till in the hou&s; for the greater gra|vity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Jo. Hetherington,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving made an end of this di&s;patch near two daies &s;ince. I have &s;tayed expecting, and untill this hour do, the <HI>Chi|ouz;</HI> whom they pretend to &s;tay for &s;ome Services of the Grand Signors, as they did the la&s;t: but I hope this day to get him di&s;pacht, and &s;o come to my private In&s;tructions to your &s;elf:</P>
<P N="1">1. Wherein (as in my Publique to <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and you, as al&s;o in your former) you are to make that of Publique &s;hew its face outward, and to come fir&s;t in Action; the fir&s;t part of that pretence is now almo&s;t fini&s;hed, I mean the Leviation for Pa&s;t-Charges; and when that &s;hall bee fully fini&s;hed, I re&s;olve to begin with Proui&s;ion for the Publique in future; taking into con&s;ideration the di&s;tractions of <HI>England,</HI> the War at our door here, the <HI>French</HI> forces before <HI>Ligorne:</HI> and by all the&s;e a likelyhood that wee may bee in an ill condition here, ere long: and therefore it will bee fit to look out in time, and provide &s;ome means at lea&s;t, for future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; wherein the Company &s;tand obliged to the Crown of <HI>En|gland</HI> by their Charter, and to mee by their Covenant to make Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. When this in hand is done, that other may bee taken order for; and in the <HI>interim,</HI> under the colour of the one and the other, the full of the E&s;tate or mo&s;t of it may bee di&s;|covered; and after this, I &s;hall have opportunity to bring in my own pretences, for which you have Warrant &s;ufficient and particular with you already; and this latter Warrant now &s;ent you, will &s;erve you for the other two&mdash; and for|mer part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> for finding out, di&s;covery, and &s;ecuring what you finde until further Order, in what hands or place &s;oever; However, I wi&s;h it by convenient degrees and &s;teps, at lea&s;t not findeing occa&s;ion to the contrary.</P>
<P N="3">3. With the Merchants, in its time you may treat their
<PB N="48" REF="37"> rea&s;on apart, <HI>viz.</HI> that this concerns their own pre&s;ervation, as well as mine; and that they may be &s;ure before any E&s;tate more goes out of the Countrey, I will &s;ee at lea&s;t how as well this, as that Scale may bee pre&s;erved; That a Factory, this a Re&s;idence, untill it may plea&s; God wee meet with better times.</P>
<P>With the Ma&s;ters you may deal in another way, (if they or either of them de&s;erv it,) <HI>viz.</HI> a&s;&s;ure them a good and con&s;i|derable fraight, if they will but have patience; and &s;o may happily al&s;o con&s;ider their demurrage, in ca&s;e they behave them&s;elves as they ought; on the other &s;ide they may bee &s;ure, I will not overthrow &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable a re&s;olution and de&s;ign of the Publick, and of &s;o near a relation to the pre&s;ervation of all the Trade, Peace, my &s;elf and Ho&s;tages here, for the con&s;ideration of 2 or 3 &s;hips particular accom|modation, or their demurrage a moneth more or le&s;s; and if you finde them not capable of this good Coun&s;el and rea&s;on, or not &s;o con&s;ciencious of the other as to prefer it before their own Ends, you are to proceed with them accordingly; for, I have no &s;uch obligation to either of them, as may &s;eem weighty enough to ballance the former.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now in ca&s;e any of the Factory after payment of their Leviation mony or &s;ecuritie therefore, &s;hould de&s;ire to bee free to lade, or to have their E&s;tate at Liberty; you are to tell them that by fre&s;h Order from mee, you have command to hold the Goods, and Ships as directed, &amp; upon the grounds aforemen|tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> till provi&s;ion for the future bee mad;e this Levia|tion being alreayd eaten up and &s;pent, before paid; and though you &s;hould have made any other pretence hitherunto, (though till further direction you had not Order at lea&s;t to mention ought of my particular beyond the Leviation) you may ex|cu&s;e it lightly, and &s;ay you were merry with them, ctc. as they are often with mee.</P>
<P N="5">5. If any &s;hould que&s;tion the rea&s;on and ground of this proceeding now, that was never in Pre&s;ident before, you may bid them and the Company thank them&s;elves for a great part of it; for (be&s;ides the rea&s;ons before expre&s;&s;ed) they have
<PB N="49" REF="38"> Ordered their Factors to convey away all their E&s;tates, and to leav mee naked here, and the General of the Trade at Ran|dam, and every one to &s;hift for him&s;elf; which I beeing ad|vi&s;ed of, have rea&s;on to look out as well for theirs as my own &s;afety. Next I have heard of &s;om Combinations again&s;t my particular, and &s;hall de&s;ire to provide the be&s;t I may for that too; but bee &s;ure you di&s;cover nothing of my own pretences, untill the la&s;t, and that not untill further order.</P>
<P N="6">6. You will in your Warrant, and &s;o in the Command, finde Order for rendring into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all goods a|board the Ships, belonging to any of our Nation; wherein I would have you walk with great circum&s;pection; Fir&s;t to di&s;cover from the Cu&s;tomer and Ma&s;ters what and by whom laden, (I care not &s;o much for who&s;e accounts, though if you can get that, it will bee well, and a further advantage; for if it bee for any Engli&s;h I care not for whom; or if by any En|gli&s;h laden, I care not by whom:) then to &s;eque&s;ter it: and that done, take Caution of the Ma&s;ter beeing aboard, and party to whom it belongs, that it bee alway forth-coming upon further Order; which if either the Ma&s;ter or Merchants &s;hall refu&s;e, you are without further re&s;pect whatever by the <HI>Chouz</HI> and <HI>Caddie</HI> to take them into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as in your In&s;tructions, and by the Command directed, which is to be your refuge at all times. In ca&s;e the Ma&s;ters &s;hall &s;ay that they cannot tell to whom the goods belong till Bills of la|ding &s;igned; they cannot however deny to tell you by what and by whom laden; at lea&s;t the Cu&s;tomer if hee will, can di&s;cover it, and you are to pre&s;s either according to occa&s;ion; and if need bee bring them before the <HI>Caddy to</HI> that end; and (in ca&s;e they refu&s;e) there endeavour to cau&s; them unlade a new; wherein the Cu&s;tomer &s;hall not loo&s; his Cu&s;tom, you agreeing with him to that end.</P>
<P>If they have not &s;igned Bills of lading (as mo&s;t likely they have not, for that is commonly the la&s;t work) di&s;cove|ring who&s;e goods they are, or who laded them, you are to forbid the Ma&s;ters to give Bills till further Order; and if the Ma&s;ters refu&s;e or delay, to proceed again&s;t them according

<P N="7">7. In ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance or any Clamorous Hubub, as in <HI>Porters</HI> ca&s;e, by the Mariners, you may require a guard of the <HI>Caddie,</HI> and promi&s;e payment for it to their content; or make u&s;e of the Ca&s;tle to hold your pri&s;oners in occa&s;ion; (for I &s;hall little doubt to u&s;e <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> help again&s;t tho&s;e that oppo&s;e that authority of my Ma&s;ters which I hold in <HI>Turkie</HI> by com|mi&s;&s;ion: and I conjure you bee not &s;crupulous in that&mdash; what will com of it: However, look you proceed not ra&s;h|ly nor unadvi&s;edly in any thing, nor &s;uffer your &s;elf to bee particularly provoked, and &s;o &s;poil your Cau&s;e, but proceed alwaies according to the Command and &s;tyle of the plain, Lawes, and formes of it (where my authority will not &s;erv) <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Caddy</HI> and power of the place, &amp; their own officers, whatever you pay for it, which in all occa&s;ion will bee your ju&s;tification and mine: and they will &s;econd your procee|dings with <HI>Arz</HI> and <HI>Maxars</HI> from time to time to the Port; which in occa&s;ion you are to &s;eek and to back your &s;elf and mee withall: and for this end bee &s;ure to keep the <HI>Caddy</HI> and tho&s;e about him &s;o much yours, as not to &s;uffer the Mer|chants, Ma&s;ters of Ships or other of the Town whoever, to have any: at lea&s;t to &s;uch effect as may do you prejudice or the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. For &s;earch and entering of hou&s;es to that end, (though that bee the &s;ub&s;tance at the Command and &s;hadow of this di&s;patch, and really the &s;ub&s;tance too, in occa&s;ion) you are to proceed in that with care, re&s;pect, and moderation al&s;o having good a&s;&s;urance by particular marks, &s;igns, if you can, or witne&s;s touching what you go about and pretend unto, before you force or enter any place, for books or other things.</P>
<P N="9">9. Touching tho&s;e four men principally appointed to be at|tached, you &s;hall ob&s;erv a fit time for that, that is either fin|ding them lading or to have laden &s;ince order, or to conceale their E&s;tate, or to have conveyed them away, and thereon
<PB N="51" REF="40"> take them into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and if need bee (doubting their di&s;turbance or future procedings in lading &amp;c.) to &s;end them away immediately by &s;om of the <HI>Chouzes</HI> &s;ervants; which, I know will not onely &s;tartle all the re&s;t below, and give them new occa&s;ion to a better &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, then to think to conquer by a contra&s;t. However have &s;om &s;uch occa&s;ion fir&s;t, or at lea&s;t pretend it if you want one; for ti's all one in this ca&s;e, and I confe&s;s I had rather you &s;end the&s;e men away, then meddle with the Ma&s;ters (if you can avoid it) for all their principal Traders and Patrones beeing &s;ent away, the Ma&s;ters mu&s;t then perforce obey or bee gon, as they are, laden or unladen, (which will trouble them more then all the o-other &s;ort of force you can u&s;e to them.)</P>
<P N="10">10. You are to ob&s;erv, or at lea&s;t to demand in my name, and by my order, to whom this new come Ship is con&s;igned; and from that Party or Parties demand &s;ecurity in the premi&s;|&s;es; or for default proceed with him and them as in the other directed.</P>
<P N="11">11. If <HI>Bogus</HI> perform not what he hath promi&s;ed me (with a thou&s;and oaths,) <HI>viz.</HI> if hee hinder not the Ships from lading, take not order, and &s;ecure you, that they depart not without your leav and my direction fir&s;t had; or di&s;cover not, or en|deavour at lea&s;t by &s;ome probable waies to di&s;cover &s;uch E|&s;tates of the Merchants as are concealed, or &s;hall do any other trick out of Rule, or again&s;t you; without &s;aying much to him or quarrelling the thing there, &s;end mee word by an expre&s;s immediately, and by a hor&s;man if to bee gotten.</P>
<P N="12">12. When you &s;end any expre&s;s at any time, be &s;ure you do it privately, for the Merchants there have way to intercept Letters; And I doubt that Me&s;&s;e which your la&s;t promi&s;ed mee the next day following may have mi&s;carried, for hee appears not yet, it beeing four daies &s;ince the others arrival; The fir&s;t Me&s;s was twelv daies on the way, the la&s;t but eight. But I think I may thank the good Company for the formers &s;tay, who were not willing hee &s;hould arrive before them; &s;end therefore a &s;ervant a dayes journey out of Town with tho&s;e you &s;end hereafter, and let none know of your &s;ending
<PB N="52" REF="41"> away (not the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter or Cape of the Me&s;&s;es) till your Letters are ready, and then &s;ee them &s;ent away pre&s;ently, as be|fore, requiring him not to take a Letter from any el&s; but your &s;elf.</P>
<P N="13">13. Though I hope there will bee no occa&s;ion for you to doubt; yet I would have you circum&s;pect (e&s;pecially if you &s;hould come to any contra&s;t with the Ma&s;ters of Ships) that the Mariners take no advantage of you by a &s;urprize, or una|wares do you an affront or mi&s;chief; you know what &s;ort of bea&s;ts they are: For which re&s;pect (in occa&s;ion) you may by the <HI>Caddies</HI> Order have a guard of his Servants, Souldiers of the Ca&s;tle, or Janizaries, a dozen or more as there &s;hall bee occa&s;ion: But I have no other thing that put's mee in minde of this, but what you your &s;elf mention in yours of their Bravadoes: However give them no advantage either by your doubts or over &s;ecurity.</P>
<P N="14">14. La&s;tly, (for I can at pre&s;ent think of nothing el&s; ma|terial,) if you want or think you &s;hall want money for your occa&s;ions, you mu&s;t &s;upply your &s;elf by Bills of Ex|change; for there is neither Credit, nor Bills to bee expect|ed from hence, but what you have, or the Cu&s;tomer. In ca&s;e it &s;hould come to a Vye there, and the <HI>Caddie</HI> were to bee pre&s;ented, you may &s;ecure him by part of the E&s;tate, till you can get Bills, or I provide for you. And &s;o beeing weary and late, go to re&s;t, re&s;ting.</P>

<P>By him you will have received fre&s;h and full Commands in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of your power, and by him directions (in ca&s;e you wanted money) what to do, which way to repair your &s;elvs; <HI>viz</HI> either by Bills of Exchange, or by &s;om of the goods under your hands, in ca&s;e tho&s;e that promi&s;ed payment there, com|plyed not, &amp; thereby gave you &s;upply; for from hence I found no po&s;&s;ibilitie of getting credit for money, and happily the <HI>Caddie</HI> would be contented (if for a rea&s;onable &s;um) to take Bills of Exchange payable to &s;ome of his Friends here.</P>
<P>For advice in what concerned the carriage of your Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; tho&s;e Letters, as al&s;o mine of the 3 and 4 pre&s;ent (&s;ent by a &s;everal expre&s;&s;es, as duplicates of each other) will have &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed you, if arrived; as I hope before this they will bee.</P>
<P>In adjunct to which I &s;end the&s;e confirming my former, with this addition only, <HI>viz.</HI> that you proceed to po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;elvs, as &s;oon as you may, with what you can, and the &s;ame take into your power as pledg and &s;ecuritie for the future provi&s;ion of the Trade, and my indempnity from &s;uch unju&s;t pretences as the Companie have rai&s;ed again&s;t Mee. In pro&s;ecution whereof, you are to proceed by &s;uch gentle &s;teps and paces, as may be&s;t and with lea&s;t non effect your
<PB N="55" REF="42"> work, and yet &s;ecure that you go about: I confe&s;s I have required of you a large &s;umm in my la&s;t, and when I came to ca&s;t up tho&s;e dammages I may &s;u&s;tein, the &s;umm rather falls &s;hort of than exceeds my ju&s;t doubts of their inju&s;t Endea|vours upon what they have in their powers to prejudice mee in, and I am certified they have made them&s;elvs Ma&s;ters of in part: However I mu&s;t content my &s;elf with what I may con|veniently do, and not &s;trein the cord too farr, lea&s;t it break and requoil upon Mee, to the hazard of that hold I had of more, and what I might have made &s;ure of, and &s;o mu&s;t leav that &s;till to your di&s;cretion to mannage; with this Order notwith&s;tanding, to take into your hands as much as you can of the fine&s;t Goods you can get; and where that fails, Cloathes will bee no ill merchandize, and &s;o good &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The Murmur here ri&s;eth every day to greater wonder, where the&s;e clouds will di&s;&s;olve and terminate, which I keep ob&s;cure hitherunto, though not un&s;u&s;pected; the rather, for that they &s;ay Captain <HI>Jordan</HI> is coming up, of which I hear not though deny not but hee may, (not complying and con|forming him&s;elf as hee ought) and &s;o who el&s; of tho&s;e there upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion: and your Rule is &s;uch at lea&s;t for tho&s;e 4 or 5 principally directed in my former.</P>
<P>As I promi&s;ed you in my la&s;t, I &s;hall begin my work here much about that time you are directed to &s;et forward there; whereof within three or four daies you will be advi&s;ed more certainly.</P>
<P>To morrow wee &s;hall have a Court, and I &s;hall there lay the foundation to the work, a&s;&s;uring my &s;elf of a denial before-hand, of what I am to demand; and then you may i|magine what will follow.</P>
<P>My Demands will bee ju&s;t, and grounded on their own Covenants, backed with Law and Equity, and &s;o long I have &s;eldom for&s;aken a good Cau&s;e; on the other &s;ide hitherto ne|ver pur&s;ued an ill, at lea&s;t contrary to my knowledg and con|&s;cience, which by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall bee my guide in this.</P>

<P>Next I &s;hould bee glad to hear you were removed from the water &s;ide, that is out of Marriners roade, and (if in that place you re&s;t in you bee &s;o) you have done the better; but whatever you do, have a care of a &s;urprize, and next of be|ing betrayed through any &s;ort of confidence, or by any mens friend&s;hip whoever; and I the rather write this from &s;ome di&s;coverie made out of the&s;e Letters which came enclo&s;ed un|der yours, from that partie you think mo&s;t &s;ure, directed to a friend of his here, which I keep by mee again&s;t a fitter oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

<P>YE&s;terday wee received your Lord&s;hips of the 4 pre&s;ent, being the Copy of the 3. And to day wee received your Lord&s;hips of the 8. and rejoyce to hear your Lord&s;hip is in &s;uch a readine&s;s for your ju&s;t demands, and wi&s;h your Lord|&s;hip le&s;s trouble, and better &s;ucce&s;s, then wee this day have had, and wee doubt for many dayes &s;hall incounter here: this morning the <HI>Caddies</HI> &s;on, with his <HI>Neipe</HI> and principall Offi|cers came, and wee began fir&s;t with the Con&s;ulls hou&s;, but before wee began 'twas &s;poken in the <HI>Caddies</HI> own hou&s;, &amp; all over the Town, our de&s;ign to &s;eiz what we could finde; about 7 a clock his &s;on came &amp; entred the Con&s;uls hou&s;, &amp; opened all the Warehou&s;es, and took from thence, with <HI>Elfords</HI> and <HI>Keebles,</HI> &s;om 400 Clothes, &amp; 9 Bales Mohairs; we left behinde us 38 Bales of Silk, 13 Bales his &s;ervant pretended were &s;old by his ma&s;ter to Mr. <HI>Brent,</HI> to be paid by Bill of Exchange at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and when advice came the Bills were paid, the Goods &s;hould bee delivered; in the mean time they lie in Mr. <HI>Lancelots</HI> Warehou&s;e, with &s;ome 40 Clothes, 60 Barrels of Tynne, which Tinne belongs to Mr. <HI>Sainthill,</HI> and &s;ealed up by the <HI>Neipe</HI> and us. Before wee had ended at this hou&s;e, the whole Town was in an uprore, being fomented by Jews, and &s;om of the young frie left behinde, and proclaimed in the Streets, that the Town would bee undone, the Trade lo&s;t and go to wrack, if this was &s;uffered; &s;o that before the Con&s;ulls door were &s;o many of the &s;cum of the Town, the Streets were packed thick of them. On the other &s;ide, a more unruly enemy threatned wor&s;e things, the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Gol|den Lyon,</HI> who had before given <HI>Barnardi&s;ton</HI> 9000 Dollars at
<PB N="61" REF="45"> <HI>Cambio,</HI> and had no Goods in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, hearing how it would fare with them, lands 40 men at <HI>Barnardi&s;tons</HI> hou&s;e, and vowed hee would have his money or goods, or &s;wore hee would beat down the Town; &s;o likewi&s;e the <HI>Jonas</HI> got her &s;ails to yards, that the <HI>Caddies</HI> &s;on and the <HI>Chiouz</HI> de|&s;ired to let it alone, untill another day, for fear of wor&s; events'; &s;o when they had made an end at <HI>Lancelots</HI> hou&s;, would &s;tay no longer, but promi&s;ed to come another day. The E&s;tate before mentioned wee carried away in &s;pight of envie, and have put it up in a &s;afe Cane: a&s;&s;oon as this was done, becau&s; the Captain would not come a&s;hore, I got <HI>Jordan</HI> to go a bord the <HI>Golden Lion,</HI> and know the Ma&s;ter his intent, and to acquaint him with the danger might en&s;ue thereon; all wee could urge was nothing, except&punc; hee had &s;atisfaction for his 9000 Dollars; at la&s;t told him, if hee knew where his E&s;tate lay, wee would endeavour to help him to it, &s;o hee found it out, and wee delivered it to him, and the man was very well &s;atisfied. And now wee hope to finde little impedi|ment, and to morrow morning the <HI>Caddies</HI> Son promi&s;eth to come again, and wee doubt not the &s;ame day but to make an end. If your Lord&s;hip &s;aw the little regard the&s;e people bear to the Grand Signors commands, the <HI>Caddie,</HI> or ought el&s; but their private ends, your Lord&s;hip would (as wee hope your Lord&s;hip will) not blame us if procured but the half of what your Lord&s;hips Letter mentions.

<HEAD>The Factors general Letter from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> dated the <HI>4</HI> of <HI>July, 1646.</HI> to the Levant Company.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Wor&s;hipfull Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may plea&s; you, our la&s;t from hence was <HI>per</HI> the &s;hip <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> advi&s;ing his Lord&s;hips proceedings for another leviation for di&s;charging your Debts at <HI>Costantinople,</HI> beeing then informed that the whole amounted unto Dollars 118109; and how wee were re&s;olved to with&s;tand it, untill your Wor&s;hips further plea&s;ure &s;hould bee &s;ignified unto us concerning the &s;ame, for &s;uch rea&s;ons as wee then pre&s;umed to lay open unto you; and that in the mean time wee had pre&s;ented our grievances to his Lord&s;hips gracious peru&s;al, the Copy whereof went annexed to our &s;aid Letter, to both which you may plea&s; to have reference.</P>
<P>The 24 of <HI>March</HI> following, our Con&s;ul called a Court, and declared his Lord&s;hips an&s;wer to our &s;aid Letter, di&s;li|king our proceedings; and by a new Order prohibited the lading of Goods, and receiving them on board, and the de|parture of Ships, untill the &s;aid leviation were paid accor|ding to his former Order, and Schedule now &s;ent down, &s;hewing each man his proportionable part for this Factory of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> amounting in all to Dollars 54950, and for the Factory at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to Dollars 56000; is together Dol|lars 110950. Whereupon, wee generally de&s;ired that his Lord&s;hip would bee plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the &s;aid Order of leviation, untill &s;uch time wee &s;hould receiv your Wor&s;hips farther Order about it, without which, wee our &s;elvs were like to pay it out of our own Pur&s;es, as in the la&s;t leviation; receiving &s;ince particular Orders from &s;ome of our principals, not to pay any leviations, otherwi&s;e it &s;hould bee for our own Accompts, and not theirs.</P>
<P>The 24 of <HI>Aprill,</HI> the Con&s;ull called another Court, &s;ig|nifying
<PB N="89" REF="59"> unto us that his Lord&s;hip did require an accompt for the departure of the Ship <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Suc|ce&s;s,</HI> contrary to his Lord&s;hips Commands, there beeing an Officer of the <HI>Viziers</HI> come down to apprehend Captain <HI>Tho. Porter,</HI> and to carrie him up to <HI>Constantinople</HI> (which Ships departed at their own plea&s;ures, beeing not in our pow|ers to &s;tay them.) And that concerning the leviation it was inevitable, and his Lord&s;hip was re&s;olved upon it, and there|fore would &s;orce us unto it, and expect repair of Honor from the Delinquents; whereupon fearing his Lord&s;hips farther di&s;plea&s;ure, which might beget &s;om greater inconveniencies among&s;t us, wee pre&s;umed to yield unto his Lord&s;hips Com|mands, by way of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive orderly complyance, and con|form our &s;elvs unto the payment of our parts of the &s;aid le|viation, in proportion to the E&s;tates wee received on the la&s;t-general Ships, <HI>Hercules, Samp&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna-Merchant,</HI> ac|cording to our particular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments; as appeareth by our general Letter pre&s;ented his Lord&s;hip, and entred in <HI>Cancella|ria,</HI> grounded upon the re&s;ult of this dayes Court; de&s;iring his Lord&s;hip would bee plea&s;ed to allow us four moneths time for payment, for &s;uch rea&s;ons as wee have alledged in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The 6 of <HI>May,</HI> the Con&s;ull told us hee had received other letters from his Lord&s;hip, prohibiting not onely the lading of Goods, and the departure of any Ships, untill the leviation bee &s;ettled; but al&s;o therein more fully &s;ignifies and declares, that untill the Grand Signors Fleet bee gone forth hee canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> permit any Ship, either at <HI>Constantinople</HI> or here, to lade or bee di&s;peeded, and that accordingly his Lord&s;hip is &s;o requi-of this State. And in like manner hath ordered and com|manded tho&s;e whom it concerns both above, and in this Port to ob&s;erv the &s;ame. And moreover farther witne&s;&s;ing, which accordingly (as hee &s;aid) hee was bound to acquaint us how that the Embargoe at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and here was &s;econded, and his Lord&s;hip to avoid farther dangers and inconvenien|cies to the Publick, could not refu&s;e his con&s;ent thereun|to.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="60">
<P>The 10 of <HI>May</HI> arrived here Mr <HI>John Hetherington,</HI> a &s;er|vant to his Lord&s;hip, and Signor <HI>Lorenzo Zuma,</HI> Greek, one of his Lord&s;hips Druggermen from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who the next morning moved our Con&s;ul to call a Court for the Na|tion; where being a&s;&s;embled, the Con&s;ul told the &s;aid <HI>He|therington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> that their de&s;ires were performed, and therefore required them to deliver what they had in Commi&s;|&s;ion from his Lord&s;hip; who produced an Order of the 27 <HI>April,</HI> directed to the Con&s;ul and us, for payment of the &s;aid Leviation forthwith, or el&s;e to proceed according to his far|ther Order, Warrant, and In&s;tructions in &s;uch behalf, and we to bee an&s;werable to &s;uch lo&s;s, dammage, and inconvenien|cies as may en&s;ue thereby. To which wee an&s;wered, that the Leviation was &s;ub&s;cribed unto, and therefore de&s;ired the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to &s;tay four or five daies, untill his Lord&s;hip &s;hould return an&s;wer to our Letter of the 24 of <HI>April:</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo</HI> told us, hee would retire and peru&s;e his Lord&s;hips Commi&s;&s;ion, and in two houres return, to have a more full and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer from us: which be|ing expired, hee declared that his Lord&s;hips Commi&s;&s;ion re|quired forthwith ready Money or Goods; (beeing his In&s;tru|ction, from which hee could not vary.) Whereupon Mr <HI>John Lancelot</HI> fir&s;t an&s;wered (as hee was a Merchant) he could not depo&s;ite his Cloth, for his Credits &s;ake, but would give his Bills for his and Mr. <HI>Dixwell Brents</HI> proportionable part of the leviation, payable at <HI>Con&s;tantinople per</HI> Mr <HI>Thomas Pi|got,</HI> at five daies &s;ight into his Lord&s;hips <HI>Cancellaria;</HI> which was refu&s;ed, unle&s;s they would depo&s;ite the value in Cloth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> part more towards charges, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> which they &s;aid again, for their Credits &s;ake (as they were Merchants) could not con&s;ent unto; &s;o referred them&s;elvs unto the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzo's</HI> farther proceed|ings, if the&s;e proffers would not bee accepted of, beeing not po&s;&s;ible for them at pre&s;ent to procure Moneys at Intere&s;t, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The like conditions wee all in generall profered for our proportionable parts, but were refu&s;ed by the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="60"> and <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> whereupon the Con&s;ull told them, they had all our a&s;&s;ents for payment of the leviation; and if that, with &s;uch rea&s;ons and proffers as wee propounded, might not bee &s;atisfactory, the Con&s;ull and wee in generall referred our &s;elves to the &s;aid <HI>Lorenzoes</HI> farther proceedings.</P>
<P>After this, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> pre&s;ently re-repaired to the <HI>Caddies,</HI> accompanied with a prime <HI>Chiouz</HI> of the <HI>Vi&s;iers,</HI> and declared their farther Commi&s;&s;ions; after publication whereof, the <HI>Caddie</HI> &s;ent for the Con&s;ull, and all our Nation, where the Capitulations were fir&s;t taken away by Warrant, and the Con&s;ull in a mo&s;t barbarous manner was laid hold on, with <HI>Dixwell Brent, Daniell Edwards, John Pixley, Samuel Barnardiston, George Hanger,</HI> and <HI>James Moye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and committed Pri&s;oners into the cu&s;tody of the &s;aid <HI>Chiouz</HI> and Officers, and tran&s;ported to a hou&s;e (taken by them on purpo&s;e) where they were violently, and in a formidable manner thru&s;t into a dark Chamber, and at length were for|ced to pre&s;ent Dollars 300, to have a window &s;et open to give them light and ayre; the Con&s;ull telling the &s;aid <HI>Hether|ington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> before hee was &s;urpri&s;ed, in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Caddies,</HI> that neither hee, or the Nation, had any wayes tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Grand Signors or his Lord&s;hips Commands, and that hee did not fear what they could do unto him, no not &s;o much as to dye, in performance of his faith and tru&s;t to the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, whom hee had truly &s;erved, as likewi&s;e for his love and affection hee bore to the Nation here under his charge, whom hee would never betray, hoping &s;hortly to &s;ee his own Countrey again. And in two hours after, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington, Lorenzo,</HI> and <HI>Chiouz, Caddie,</HI> and <HI>Neipe,</HI> &s;ealed up all our Counting-hou&s;es, Magazines, and &s;ome Chambers; and in two dayes after tran&s;ported the Pri|&s;oners overland, up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where they were deli|vered to his Lord&s;hips power and &s;afe cu&s;tody; wee in the mean time being left like &s;o many Sheep without a Shepherd, and ignorant where to &s;eek protection.</P>
<P>The next day after departure of the&s;e Pri&s;oners, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> &s;ealed up our Cloth in our own
<PB N="92" REF="61"> Warehou&s;es, for what concerned our proportionable parts of the Leviation, at the rate of Dollars 45 <HI>per</HI> Cloth, and &frac13; part more towards Charges.</P>
<P>The 18 day of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</HI> at the in&s;tance of the &s;aid <HI>Hetherinton</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> the remainder of us left here behinde met toge|ther, where the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> told us wee had not brought in our bills of Exchange for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for the parts of our Leviation, and &frac13; part more; unto which wee an&s;wered, wee had complyed with his Lord&s;hips Commands, in all wil|ling and obedient manner, according to our pre&s;ent po&s;&s;ibi|lities, untill wee &s;hould bee able to &s;atisfie the &s;ame with our ready Monies here, or by our Bills payable in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> at 5 dayes &s;ight, wherein wee promi&s;ed to u&s;e our utmo&s;t indea|vors, hoping to redeem our Cloth again, which wee had depo&s;ited, and they &s;ealed up, for our proportionable parts of the Leviation.</P>
<P>In few dayes after arrived here one of the principalle&s;t <HI>Chi|ouzes</HI> of the Grand Signor with new commands &s;ent down by his Lord&s;hip, by vertue whereof the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> &s;eized upon the Per&s;ons of <HI>John Ball, Henry Davey, Phillip Farwell, Nathaniell Barnardi&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>John Ingoldsby,</HI> who were committed pri&s;oners to the &s;aid <HI>Chiouz,</HI> who u&s;ed them with &s;ome humanity, and &s;ent up the next day to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> to be delivered unto his Lord&s;hips power; after who&s;e departure (all Law being &s;et a&s;ide) the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> by this command came down, opened all our Ware|hou&s;es, and by violence carried all our Goods away into &s;e|verall Canes of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as well what they had &s;ealed up, for the Leviation, as all other Goods of what nature &s;oever they could finde, unle&s;s it were &s;uch as was &s;ealed up, and belonged to <HI>Turks,</HI> and other of the Grand Signors Subjects, and left many of us &s;o bare, that wee had not wherewithall to afford us a piece of Bread, to ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">p life and &s;oul together, onely bare promi&s;es. The &s;aid <HI>Chiouz</HI> remaining behinde, put us dayly into great fears that wee &s;hould all bee &s;ent up, or clapt up here in Pri&s;on, which cau&s;ed many of us to repair on board the &s;hip for &s;uccour, here being in harbour the
<PB N="93" REF="61"> Ships <HI>Rainbow, Jonas, Hopewell,</HI> and <HI>Triangle.</HI></P>
<P>In all which time of this di&s;traction and &s;ufferings our mi&s;eries have been much condoled by the chief <HI>Turks</HI> and in|habitants of this place, who &s;eem to &s;ympathi&s;e with us in our &s;ad conditions; and had not the Commands been &s;o powerfull, the whole Town would have ri&s;en up in our de|fen&s; and protection, who have privately advi&s;ed of the&s;e abu|&s;es, which as they them&s;elves confe&s;s, are like to ruine, not only this &s;cale, but that of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> al&s;o, to the di&s;honor of the Grand Signor, and ruine of many of his Subjects, and of a profitable and acceptable friend (our Nati|on) to become a potent enemy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The 28 of <HI>June</HI> came letters from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> advi&s;ing the <HI>Vi&s;iers</HI> Order for re&s;cuing both Factories from his Lord|&s;hips impri&s;onment, and particular advice to &s;ome of us here left, for apprehending the Per&s;ons of the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and to keep them in &s;afe Cu&s;todies on board our Ships, fearing (wee having no order as yet to receiv our E|&s;tates out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions) they might convey our &s;aid E&s;tates away, or &s;ell them for half their worth, and &s;o make their private e&s;capes out of Town, expecting dayly a <HI>Chiouz</HI> to carry up their Per&s;ons to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to free our Goods, hoping all will go well again for us. Hereupon the very &s;ame day, the &s;aid <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> (without any noi&s; or rumor) were by the Marriners conveyed on board &s;everall Ships from the &s;aid <HI>Hetherintons</HI> lodging; <HI>viz.
