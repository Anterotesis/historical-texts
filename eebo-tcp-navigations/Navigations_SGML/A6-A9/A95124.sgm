<HEAD>TRUE NEWS of another bloody Battle, of the King of Poland WITH THE TURKS And al&s;o an Account of the taking of the <HI>Great VIZIER</HI> And divers other Turki&s;h Lords, and Great Commanders, and of the Re|deeming many thou&s;and Chri&s;tian Captives from SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<P>THe La&s;t Letters from <HI>Germany,</HI> of the 20, 21&s;t, and 22d. In|&s;tant, give Account that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was Encam|ped, about Twenty <HI>Leagues</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> of <HI>Vien|na,</HI> with the Army of <HI>German,</HI> as well as <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, under his Command; and that in the Per&s;uit of the <HI>Turks-</HI> Since the Twelveth, before <HI>&V;ienna,</HI> they had cut many <HI>Scatter'd Parties</HI> into Pieces, and have taken near forty heavy <HI>Cannon:</HI> with a con&s;iderable quantity of <HI>Aminition</HI> that Attended them, and had al&s;o, a Fierce Battle, with a Grand Body of the Turki&s;h Hor&s;e; who where under the Conduct of the <HI>Grand
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">Vizier</HI> in Per&s;on, &amp; had killed near twenty thou&s;and of them upon the place. And it is credibly Affirm'd the <HI>Grand-Vizier,</HI> is taken <HI>Pri&s;oner</HI> the Principle Standard of the <HI>Ottaman Empire</HI> is al&s;o taken; not without lo&s;s on the Chri&s;tian &s;ide: For the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;aid to Engage in this Battle with a fury, rather proceeding from an Apprehenti|on of De&s;pair, than true Courage, or good Conduct; and continued the Battle &s;everal Hours with great ob&s;tinacy, notwith&s;tanding the great Slaughters the Chri&s;tians made in all parts of the Battle. This Battle being ended, and the Chri&s;tians by the miraculous Providence of God, crowned with a &s;econd Victory, continued their per&s;uit with great eagerne&s;s, and fell upon another party of Turki&s;h Hor&s;e, (who had the Conduct of near Ten thou&s;and Chri|&s;tian Captives) and Totally Routed them, and redeemed the poor Chri&s;tians from the perpetual Chains of <HI>Bondage</HI> that then had &s;eized them. Mo&s;t of the &s;aid poor Chri&s;tians, were young choice Men, that the Turks had Catcht up, ever &s;ince they made this la&s;t Inva&s;ion, into the Chri&s;tian Emerours Country's. (In their Ra|vaging, they cut off all Middle-Aged, and Elderly people without re&s;pect of per&s;ons or Sexes.) This dileverance of the poor Cap|tives, being no way le&s;s Con&s;iderable than the former; and for which all good Chri&s;tians in Duty, ought to Return hearty thanks, to the Divine di&s;po&s;er of all things. The undanted and unwearied King of <HI>Poland,</HI> after this Defeat, had not pur&s;ued the Enemy above three, or four Leagues, but recieved Advice by <HI>Scouts,</HI> that a Great Army of Turki&s;h Hor&s;e, was on its March with Great Expedition; which cau&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to make an Hault, &amp; &s;end expre&s;s to the Duke of <HI>Lorain;</HI> to ha&s;ten to him with the <HI>German</HI> Foot, and accordingly the <HI>Auxiliries</HI> of the Empire (who have been con&s;iderably Reinfor|ced &s;ince the Beating the Turks from <HI>&V;ienna</HI>) are on their March withal Expedition, to joyn the <HI>Poli&s;h Camp.</HI> And it's the Opinion of all, that the Turks will run the hazard of another Battle. It is al&s;o affirm'd, that be&s;ides the <HI>Grand-&V;izier,</HI> &s;everal other Per&s;ons of great Note, in the Turki&s;h State are taken Pri&s;oners; and that this fre&s;h Army has been gathered with great Diligence, and de&s;igned to joyn the <HI>&V;izier</HI> before <HI>&V;ienna,</HI> which Extraordinary preparation is judged, could not proceed otherwi&s;e, than from great A&s;&s;urances that have been privately made, as well as the open A&s;&s;i&s;tance re|cieved from the Tekilliti&s;h Rebels, the fir&s;t of which kind of Tray|tors. It's believed, the <HI>&V;ziers</HI> Letters, that were found in his Tent before <HI>&V;ienna,</HI> will more enable the Emperour to &s;ubdue both &s;orts of the Con&s;pirators (and are of greater Value: for the &s;ecuri|ty of the Empire) then the great end <HI>Immence</HI> Trea&s;ure they took from the Infidels. By the next I hope, I may give you, not only an Account of the Total De&s;truction of this New Army, but al&s;o of New-hau&s;el, or &s;ome other con&s;iderable Turki&s;h Garri&s;on, being be|&s;eiged by the Chri&s;tians.</P>
