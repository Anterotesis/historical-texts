<HEAD>To the Courteous Reader, whether Mariner or Student.</HEAD>
<P>HAving formerly &s;pent &s;ome part of my time at Sea, I perceived the Genius and Inclination of mo&s;t Mariners to be affected with drawing &s;uch Paper Schemes and Delineations of the Sphere, as might not onely repre&s;ent the &s;ame to their fancy, but likewi&s;e &s;uit the re&s;o|lution of &s;uch Spherique que&s;tions, as commonly they had occa&s;ion of; and finding a complaint among&s;t them of the want of a good Treati&s;e of that kinde, I have often wi&s;hed that &s;ome of our able Arti&s;ts would di&s;play their endeavours to that purpo&s;e, wherein failing of my de&s;ire, and con&s;idering that &s;ome mean performances of this nature have for|merly found good Acceptance with Seamen, as being &s;uitable to the meane&s;t Capacity, and performed by a Scale of &s;mall bulk and price, I thought fit to impart my Ob&s;ervations of that kinde, and certainly to the mo&s;t learned it will be matter of u&s;e and delight, to &s;ee that what|&s;oever they can perform by exact Calculation, if their Tables be free from error, may be confirmed and performed without them, by the &s;ole a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pair of Compa&s;&s;es and a bare Ruler, and what great ea&s;e en&s;ues, both in Navigation and Dyalling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by skill in carrying on of Proportions Geometrically, is &s;carcely as yet expected or apprehend|ed by tho&s;e who are &s;trangers thereto.</P>
<P>If thou art ju&s;t entring upon the Mathematicals, this Treati&s;e may &s;erve as an Introduction, in which after thou ha&s;t read to page <HI>20</HI> of the fir&s;t Part, thou maye&s;t apply thy &s;elf to the Spherical Definitions in the &s;econd Part, and there proceed, or el&s;e where, as &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;uitable to thy de&s;ires.

<P>A <HI>Point,</HI> is an imaginary Prick void of all length, breadth or depth.</P>
<P><HI>A Line,</HI> is a &s;uppo&s;ed Length without breadth or depth, the ends or limits whereof are Points.</P>
<P><HI>An Angle,</HI> derived from the word <HI>Angulus</HI> in Latine, which &s;ignifieth a Corner, is the inclination or bowing of two lines one to another, and the one touching the other, and not being directly joyned together.</P>
<P>If the Lines which contain the Angle be right Lines, then is it called a Right lined Angle.</P>
<P><HI>A right Angle,</HI> when a right Line &s;tanding upon a right Line, maketh the Angles on either &s;ide equal, each of the&s;e Angles are called Right Angles, and the Line erected is called a Perpendicu|lar Line unto the other.</P>
<P><HI>An obtu&s;e Angle,</HI> is that which is greater then a right Angle.</P>
<P><HI>An acute Angle,</HI> is that which is le&s;s then a right Angle, when tvvo Angles are both acute or obtu&s;e, they are of the &s;ame kinde, othervvi&s;e are &s;aid to be of different affection.</P>
<P><HI>An Angle,</HI> is commonly denoted by the middlemo&s;t of the three Letters &s;et to the &s;ides, including the &s;aid Angle.</P>
<P>The quantity of an Angle is mea&s;ured by the arch of a Circle, de&s;cribed upon the point of Concurrence or Inter&s;ection, where the two &s;ides inclo&s;ing the &s;aid Angle, meet.</P>
<P>By the complement of an Arch or Angle, is meant the remain|der of that Arch taken from 90^d, unle&s;s it be expre&s;&s;ed the com|plement thereof to a Semicircle of 180^d.</P>
<P><HI>A Circle,</HI> is a plain Figure contained under one Line, which is called the Circumference thereof, by &s;ome the Perimeter, Peri|phery, or Limbe, a portion or part thereof is called a Segment.</P>
<P>The Center thereof is a Point in the very mid&s;t thereof, from which Point all right lines drawn to the Circumference are equal,
<PB N="2" REF="7"> if divers Circles are de&s;cribed upon one and the &s;ame Center, they are &s;aid to be Concentrick, if upon divers Centers, they are in re&s;pect of each other &s;aid to be Excentrick.</P>
<P>The Diameter of a Circle is a right Line drawn through the Center of any Circle, in &s;uch &s;ort that it may divide the whole Circle into two equal parts.</P>
<P>The Semidiameter of a Circle, commonly called the <HI>Radius</HI> thereof, is ju&s;t one half of the Diameter, and is contained betwixt the Center and one &s;ide of the Circle.</P>
<P>A Semicircle is the one medeity or half of a whole Circle, de|&s;cribed upon the Diameter thereof.</P>
<P>And a Quadrant is ju&s;t the one fourth of a whole Circle.</P>
<P>All Circles are &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, con&s;equently a Semicircle contains 180^d, and a Quadrant 90^d, and &s;o much is the quantity of a right Angle.</P>
<P>A Minute is the &s;ixtieth part of a degree, being under&s;tood of mea&s;ure, but in time a Minute is the &s;ixtieth part of an hour, or the fourth part of a degree, 15 degrees an&s;wering to an hour, and 4 Minutes to a degree. A Minute is marked thus 1&prime;, a &s;econd is the &s;ixtieth part of a Minute, marked thus 1&Prime;.</P>
<P>Where two lines or arches cro&s;s each other, the point of meet|ing is called their Inter&s;ection, or their common Inter&s;ection.</P>

<HEAD>Otherwi&s;e in ca&s;e room be wanting.</HEAD>
<P>Upon G with the Extent of the Compa&s;&s;es unvaried, de&s;cribe a &s;mall portion of an Ark near F, then a Ruler laid over the Points C and G, will cut the &s;aid Ark at the Point F, from whence a line drawn to D, &s;hall be the Perpendicular required.</P>
<P>In this latter ca&s;e the Extent C F becomes the Secant of 60^d to the Radius C D, which Secant is always equal to the double of the Radius.</P>
<P>As to the ground of the former Way, if the three Points C G F were joyned in a right line, it would be the Diameter of a Semi|circle, an Angle in the circumference whereof made by lines, drawn from the extreamities of the Diameter, as doth the Angle C D F, is a right Angle by 31 <HI>Prop.</HI> 3 <HI>Book of</HI> Euclid.</P>

<P>Set one foot of the Com|pa&s;&s;es in the Point A, and opening the other to any competent di&s;tance, let it fall in any convenient point at plea&s;ure, as at D, then retaining that foot in D, without altering the Compa&s;&s;es, make a mark in the line A C, as at E: Now if you lay a Ruler from D to E, and by the edge of it from D, &s;et off the Extent of the Compa&s;&s;es, it will find the point B, from whence draw the line A B, and it &s;hall be the Perpendi|cular required: Thus upon a Dyal we may rai&s;e a Perpendicular from any point or part of a Line, without drawing any razes to de|face the Plain.</P>
<P>Otherwi&s;e upon the Point D, having &s;wept the Point E, with

<P>In Dyalling, to &s;hun drawing of Lines on a Plain, it may be of frequent u&s;e to prick off an Angle by Sines or Tangents in &s;tead of Chords, it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to define the&s;e kinde of Lines.</P>
<P N="1"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>1. <HI>A Chord</HI> is a right line drawn in a Circle from one part of the Circum|ference to another, thus G L is the Chord of the Arch G A L, as al&s;o of the Arch G B L, al&s;o A B the Dia|meter, is the Chord of the Semicircle A D B and A K B: now for the ready pricking off of any Arch, there may be one quadrant of a Circle divided into nine equal parts, or a whole Semicircle into 18 equal parts,
<PB N="11" REF="11"> and one of tho&s;e parts below the Diameter into ten Sub-divi&s;ions, but if you divide the Arch B D into 90 equal parts, then &s;etting one foot of a pair of Compa&s;&s;es in B, extend the other to each de|gree of the &s;aid Arch, and transfer tho&s;e extents into the line B C, as we have done, for every tenth degree to 60 degrees, and it &s;hall be a Line of Chords, which may be continued further at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The right Sine</HI> of an Arch is half the Chord of twice that Arch: thus G F being the half of G L, is the Sine of the Arch, G A half of the Arch G A L, whence it follows that the right Sine of an Arch le&s;s then a quadrant, is al&s;o the right Sine of that Arks re&s;idue from a Semicircle, becau&s;e, as was &s;hewed above, the Chord of an Ark is the &s;ame both to an Ark le&s;&s;er then a quadrant, and to its complement to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>What an Arch wants of a quadrant, is called the Complement thereof: thus the Arch D G is the Complement of the Arch A G, and H G is the Sine of the Arch D G, or which is all one, it is the Co&s;ine of the Arch A G, and the Line H G being equal to C F, it follows that the right Sine of the Complement of an Arch is equal to that part of the Diameter, which lieth between that Arch and the Center.</P>
<P>From the former Scheme al&s;o follows another Definition of a right Sine, as namely, that it is a right Line falling from one end of any Arch perpendicularly upon the Radius, drawn to the other end of the &s;aid Arch, &s;o is G F perpendicular to C A, being the Sine of the Arch G A; likewi&s;e A I falls perpendicularly on C G, therefore by the &s;ame definition is al&s;o the Sine of the &s;aid Arch.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Ver&s;ed Sine</HI> of an Arch is that part of the Diameter which lieth between the right Sine of that Arch and the Circumfe|rence: thus F A is the Ver&s;ed Sine of the Arch G A, and F B the Ver&s;ed Sine of the Arch B D G.</P>
<P N="4">4. If unto one end of an Arch there be drawn a Radius, and to the other end a right line from the Center, cutting the Circle, and if from the end of the Radius a Perpendicular be rai&s;ed till it meet with the Line cutting the Circle, that Perpendicular is the Tangent of that Arch: thus A E is the Tangent of the Arch G A, and D M is the Cotangent of the &s;aid Ark, namely, it is the Tangent of the Arch H G, which is the Complement of the former Arch.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="12">5. The afore&s;aid right Line cutting the Circle, is called the Secant of the &s;aid Arch: thus C E is the Secant of the Arch G A, and C M is the Co&s;ecant of the &s;aid Arch, for it is the Secant of the Arch D G.</P>
<P N="6">6. A&s;&s;igning the Radius C A to be an unit with Ciphers at plea&s;ure, to define or expre&s;s the quantities of the&s;e re&s;pective lines, in relation to the Arches to which they belong, were to make a Table of natural Sines, Tangents and Secants; of which at large &s;ee Mr. <HI>Newtons Trigonometria Brittanica,</HI> for abbreviate ways, and &s;omething we &s;hall adde about it in the Arithmetical part of Navigation.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Tables being made, their chief u&s;e was to work the Rule of Three, or Golden Rule Arithmetically, by multiplying the &s;e|cond and third tearms of any Proportion, and dividing by the fir&s;t, and thereby to re&s;olve all Propo&s;itions relating either to Plain or Spherical Triangles, which in lines is performed by drawing a line parallel to the Side of a Triangle, and where four tearms either in Sines, Tangents, Secants, Ver&s;ed Sines, are expre&s;&s;ed, as the fir&s;t to the &s;econd, &s;o is the third to the fourth, it implyes a Propor|tion, and that the &s;econd and third tearm are to be multiplyed to|gether, and the Product divided by the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The proportion or rea&s;on of two numbers, or reference of one to the other, is mea&s;ured by the Quotient, the one being divided by the other.</P>
<P><HI>A Proportion</HI> is then &s;aid to be direct, when the third tearm bears &s;uch proportion to the fourth, as the fir&s;t to the &s;econd: four num|bers are &s;aid to be proportional when as often as the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond are the one contained in the other, &s;o often are the third and fourth the one contained in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Reciprocal Proportion</HI> is when the fourth tearm bears &s;uch Pro|portion to the third, as the fir&s;t doth to the &s;econd.</P>
<P><HI>A Proportion</HI> is &s;aid to hold <HI>alternately,</HI> when the &s;econd and third tearms thereof change places, and <HI>inver&s;ly,</HI> when the order of the tearms are &s;o altered, that one of the three fir&s;t tearms &s;hall become the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Divers Proportions are expre&s;&s;ed in this following Book, which if the Reader would apply to Tables, he mu&s;t under&s;tand that when a Side or an Angle is greater then a Quadrant, that in &s;tead of the
<PB N="13" REF="12"> Sine, Tangent, or Secant of &s;uch an Ark, he mu&s;t take the Sine, Tangent, or Secant of that Arks complement to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>That the words <HI>Co&s;ine</HI> or <HI>Cotangent</HI> of an Arch given or &s;ought, &s;ignifie the Sine or Tangent of the Complement of the Arch given or &s;ought.</P>
<P>That the Co&s;ine or Cotangent of an Arch greater then a Qua|drant, is the Sine or Tangent of the exce&s;s of that Arch above a Quadrant, or 90 degrees.</P>
<P N="8">8. What trouble the Ancients were at in re&s;olving of Propor|tions by Multiplication and Divi&s;ion, is wonderfully abbreviated by an admirable Invention called <HI>Logarithmes,</HI> where by framing and &s;ub&s;tituting other numbers in &s;tead of the former, Multiplica|tion is changed into Addition, and Divi&s;ion into Sub&s;traction; of which al&s;o &s;ee the former Book <HI>Trigonometria Brittanica.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Two other general ways for working Proportions in Sines.</HEAD>
<P>Let the Proportion be:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 70^d <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 50^d, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 35^d. <HI>To what Sine? An&s;wer:</HI> 27^d, 50&prime;.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Having drawn the Quadrant D E with 60^d of the Chords, and its two Radii D C, C E at right Angles in the Center, prick down from the Chords one of the middle tearms, to wit, 35^d from D to H, and draw a line into the Center, and upon the &s;aid line from the Center to A, prick down out of the Sines the other mid|dle tearm, to wit, 50^d, and through the Point A draw the line A B parallel to D C, then count the fir&s;t tearm from D to G 70^d, and draw a line from the Center which pa&s;&s;eth through A B at F, and the extent C F mea&s;ured on the Sines, is 27^d 50&prime; the fourth Proportional, and thus the fir&s;t tearm may be varied as much as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Otherwi&s;e:</HI></P>
<P>Place the Sine of the fir&s;t tearm, to wit, of 70^d, which in this Example is the neare&s;t di&s;tance from G to D C &s;o from the Cen|ter, that it may cro&s;s A B produced when need requires: In this Example it cro&s;&s;eth it at I, a ruler over the Center and the point I,
<PB N="23" REF="17"> cuts the Limbe at K, and the Arch D K being 27^d 50&prime;, is the mea&s;ure of the fourth Proportional, as before.</P>
<P>When it cannot be there placed, to wit, as when the Sine of the fir&s;t tearm is &s;horter then C B, the fourth Proportional is more then the Radius, and the Arch of the fir&s;t tearm being counted from D towards E, a line from the Center meeting with A B produced, &s;hall be the Secant of the fourth Proportional to the common Radius of the Quadrant.</P>
<P>The Demon&s;tration of this Scheme is inferred from varying the Proportion, which may &s;tand thus, by changing the two fir&s;t tearms into their complements, and altering their order they be|come Secants.</P>
<P><HI>As the Secant of</HI> 55^d <HI>to Secant</HI> 20^d, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 50^d <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 27^d 50&prime;.</P>
<P>If C B be made Radius, then is C A the Secant of 55^d to the &s;ame Radius, and it is al&s;o by con&s;truction the Sine of 50^d to the common Radius, then from the proportion of equality, becau&s;e the fir&s;t tearm is equal to the third, the &s;econd tearm C F being the Secant of 20^d to the le&s;&s;er Radius, is al&s;o the Sine of the fourth Proportional to the common Radius, this &s;uitable to the former of tho&s;e directions, the latter carries on this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 50^d <HI>to Sine of</HI> 70^d, <HI>So is the Secant of</HI> 55^d <HI>to the Secant of</HI> 62^d 10&prime;.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A third, being the common Geometrical way of working all Pro|portions in Lines, is by drawing a Line parallel to the Side of a Plain Triangle.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Thus from the for|mer Scheme make C A the Secant of 55^d to the le&s;&s;er Radius, and C H the Sine of 50^d to the common Radius, and joyne A H; al&s;o make C F the Secant of 20^d, and draw F G parallel to A H, then becau&s;e A C is equal
<PB N="24" REF="18"> to H C, therefore F C &s;hall be equal to G C, wherefore the Sine of the fourth Proportional is equal to the Secant of the &s;e|cond Proportional, which is the foundation of the former Scheme; which form of Operation holds generally, though by rea&s;on of ex|cur&s;ions we &s;hall pur&s;ue other forms of Operation more &s;peedy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another way for working Proportions in Sines with a Line of Chords onely.</HEAD>
<P>Let the Proportion be:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 30^d <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 18^d, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 23^d. <HI>To what Sine? An&s;wer is,</HI> 14^d.</P>
<P>If a Line of Sines be wanting, it may be ob&s;erved that a Line of Chords will &s;upply the defect thereof, by doubling the three fir&s;t tearms, and you will for the fourth tearm finde the Chord of twice the Arch &s;ought, the half whereof is the Arch &s;ought.</P>
<P>The three tearms of the former Proportion doubled, are 60^d, 36^d, 46^d.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Draw the line A B, and therein prick down the Chord of 60 de|grees from A to B, upon which Point, with the Chord of 36 de|grees, de&s;cribe the Ark C, and draw a line from A ju&s;t touching the outward extreamity of it, then prick down the Chord of 46 degrees from A to D, the neare&s;t di&s;tance from it to the line A C, is the Chord of 28 degrees, the half whereof be|ing 14 degrees, is the fourth Proportional Sine &s;ought.</P>
<P>It will be convenient to de&s;cribe the Ark C always with the lea&s;t of the three tearms, and this kinde of Operation is be&s;t when the two fir&s;t tearms of the Proportion are fixed.</P>
<P>If the Proportion had been of the le&s;s to the greater:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 36^d <HI>is to the Sine of</HI> 60^d, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 14^d <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 23^d.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18">
<P>In this ca&s;e the Chord of 28 degrees mu&s;t be &s;o entred on the line A B, that on foot re&s;ting thereon, the other turned about &s;hould but ju&s;t touch the line A C, the foot of the Compa&s;&s;es would re&s;t at D, and the extent D A, being the Chord of 46 de|grees, the half thereof 23 degrees, is the fourth Proportional &s;ought.</P>
<P>This way was chiefly added, to &s;hew the manner of Proportion|ing out of any line to a le&s;&s;er Radius, for here A B being the common Radius, and the extent wherewith the ark C was de&s;cri|bed another le&s;&s;er Radius, the neare&s;t di&s;tance from D to A C, &s;hal be the Chord of 46 degrees to the &s;aid le&s;&s;er Radius.</P>

<P>This Scheme I fir&s;t met with in a Map made in <HI>Holland,</HI> the foundation whereof was long &s;ince laid by <HI>Copernicus</HI> and <HI>Regiomon|tanus,</HI> who from a right lined plain Triangle, happening at the Center of the Sphere, have pre&s;cribed a Method of Calculation for finding an Angle when three Sides are given: Here we &s;hall illu&s;trate the Conver&s;e, how from two Sides and the Angle com|prehended, to find the third Side.</P>
<P>From any two points in the Sphere, &s;uppo&s;e Perpendiculars to fall on the plain of the Equator here repre&s;ented by AE L Q M, which Perpendiculars are the Sines of the Latitudes of tho&s;e two Points, and the di&s;tance of the points in the Plain of the Equino|ctial from the Center of the Sphere, are the Co&s;ines of tho&s;e Lati|tudes, &amp; the angle at the Center between tho&s;e points in the plain of the Equator, is equal to the arch of the Equinoctial between the two Meridians, pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;uppo&s;ed Points in the Sphere: now a right line extended in the Sphere between any two Points, is the Chord of the Ark of di&s;tance between tho&s;e Points.</P>
<P>Under&s;tand then, that the three Points A, C, B, limit the Sides of a righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> lined Triangle in the Plain of the Equator, where|of the Angle A C B is at the Center, then the extent A B is placed from A to E, if then we draw D E G perpendicular to A Q, and place B I from E to G and D, the extent L G &s;hall be the Chord of the third Side when the places are in different Hemi|&s;pheres, and the extent L D is the Chord of their di&s;tance when they are in the &s;ame Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>And if the extent E D, E G, be placed from L to H and K, the line D E G need not be drawn, becau&s;e the extent L G and L D, if it be rightly conceived, are the two very Points at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed in the Sphere, the extent A B as to matter of Calculation, being one Side of a plain Triangle right angled.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Art of Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>THe end of this Art, is to &s;hew how a Ship is to be &s;teered and guided, that at length &s;he may arrive at the de&s;i|red Port.</P>
<P>The Imperfections and Defects of this Art are many, partly in the skill or theorick, partly in the practice.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Principles, or in the Theorick, a great defect is, that the true Longitudes of Places are not yet known, and unle&s;s the true Longitudes and Latitudes of Places be known, their true Cour&s;es and Di&s;tances cannot be found, whence it will unavoi|dably follow, that no true reckoning can be kept.</P>
<P>After a long Voyage, when a Ship is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a compe|tent di&s;tance, or not very far off the main Land, it is a u&s;ual cu|&s;tom of the Ma&s;ter to require from his Mates an account of their judgement concerning the bearing and di&s;tance of &s;ome Cape or Head-land which they may make, or gain &s;ight of, and in the event he that gives the be&s;t judgement, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have kept the be&s;t reckoning; and this may be admitted of, provided they were all at fir&s;t agreed concerning the true Cour&s;e and Di&s;tance of the Place they &s;hall fir&s;t e&s;pie, from that place from which they were bound, otherwi&s;e a bad reckoning in the re&s;ult may prove better then a good one, in re&s;pect of the uncertainty in the Longitude: I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> and others have made &s;uch grie|vous Complaints as the&s;e.</P>
<P>That there is 150 or 200 Leagues error in the di&s;tance between the <HI>Bay of Mexico</HI> and the <HI>Azores,</HI> and in &s;ome Charts about 600 Leagues error in the di&s;tance between <HI>Cape Mendo&s;ino</HI> and <HI>Cape California,</HI> which great errors are partly to be a&s;cribed to the uncertainty of Longitude, and partly to the Plain Chart, which makes Places far more di&s;tant then they would be, and &s;ituated much out of their true Rumbe.</P>
<P>Another uncertainty there is in keeping the Ship &s;teered upon
<PB N="2" REF="36"> the true Rumbe, albeit it were known, for the Wyres of the Needle being touched by the Load-&s;tone, are &s;ubject to be drawn a&s;ide by any Iron near it, and liable to variation, and doth not &s;hew the true North and South, which ought continually to be ob&s;erved and allowed for, as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>And moreover in one and the &s;ame Region or Place, doth not exactly &s;hew the &s;ame Rumbe or Cour&s;e, as is well known to Dyalli&s;ts, by their Experiments in ob&s;erving the Situation of a Wall; thereby <HI>Maetius</HI> &s;aith, he &s;ometimes found a degree or two difference, and Mr. <HI>Gunter</HI>'s Experiments at <HI>Limehou&s;e,</HI> for finding the variation, made it in &s;ome places of the &s;ame ground more by half a degree then in other places, and in &s;ome other places le&s;s, which may be thus illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>Let a Sea-Compa&s;s, or rather a Box and Needle, be fa&s;tened upon a Surveying In&s;trument, &s;o that the Needle may exactly point to &s;ome mark or graduation in the Box, whereto it may be afterwards &s;et, and then looking through the Sights of the In&s;tru|ment, ob&s;erve what mark, as Tree, Tower, Building, or the like, appears in view to the eye, and if there be no &s;uch mark, then a Staff may be &s;et up at a competent di&s;tance, then move the Field-In&s;trument round, that the Needle may totter and be un&s;etled, but the Sights not altered, and afterwards in the &s;ame place let it &s;ettle it &s;elf to point out the very &s;ame Point or mark in the Box, as it did before, then if you look through the former &s;ights, the mark &s;et up will not appear in the &s;ame vi&s;ual line to the eye, as before, but on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>And if there be &s;o much uncertainty on the firm Land; how much more in the floating Sea, where the Ship may be carried a|way with &s;ecret and unknown Currents; for the finding out whereof it will be nece&s;&s;ary for the Ma&s;ters and Mates when they &s;ee any I&s;land or Land, to ob&s;erve which way the ripples of water u&s;e to &s;et: It will al&s;o be very advantagious to ob&s;erve the u&s;ual cu&s;toms of the Winds, called <HI>A Trade Wind,</HI> which many times cau&s;eth the Sea to have a Cour&s;e or Current therewith, as <HI>Maetius</HI> in&s;tanceth by an Example between <HI>Bra&s;ilia</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> in the op|po&s;ite Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>From the tenth of <HI>April</HI> to the tenth of <HI>July,</HI> the Current &s;ets North-we&s;t.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="36">
<P>From the tenth of <HI>July</HI> to the tenth of <HI>October,</HI> it &s;eems to have no motion.</P>
<P>From the tenth of <HI>October</HI> to the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> it &s;ets South|we&s;t.</P>
<P>And from the tenth of <HI>January</HI> to the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> it &s;eems to have no motion again.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance of the uncertainty in a reckoning by rea&s;on of Currents, may be taken from <HI>Davis</HI> his <HI>Streights,</HI> where the Sea flows with &s;uch a violent, &s;ecret, or undi&s;cerned force, that tho&s;e which &s;teer from thence Ea&s;t by the Compa&s;s, do finde they have made their Cour&s;e South-ea&s;t, which is a &s;ufficient In&s;tance of the danger and uncertainty of Navigation, for when a Ship &s;teers but one Rumbe, or 11^d &frac14; from the true Cour&s;e, in the &s;pace of an hundred Leagues, &s;he &s;hall fall wide of expectation almo&s;t ten Leagues, or 1/10 of the di&s;tance, which in four Rumbes error will amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to about 70 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>The E&s;timation</HI> of the di&s;tance &s;ailed, for the mo&s;t part depends upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he judgement, albeit when the Cour&s;e is directly under the Meridian, it may be known by Ob&s;ervation of the difference of Latitude, if we &s;uppo&s;e the true quantity of the mea&s;ure of a degree on the Surface of the eatrh to be agreed upon, and hereby E&s;timation ought to be rectified, which otherwi&s;e is helped and furthered by the Log-line; the uncertainty whereof by Currents is &s;o great, that <HI>Maetius</HI> in&s;tanceth, that an expert Ma&s;ter being bound to the <HI>I&s;le of St. Helens</HI> in the mid&s;t of the Sea, in 16^d of South Latitude, and having got into the parallel or Latitude there|of, thinking to make it Ea&s;tward, was notwith&s;tanding carried by the hidden Motion or Current of the Sea about 800 Miles We&s;t|ward, till he found him&s;elf near <HI>America</HI> or <HI>Bra&s;ilia,</HI> and yet notwith&s;tanding &s;temmed the Current with a fair Wind: And <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ellius</HI> in&s;tanceth that a Navigator of good repute failing out of <HI>Holland,</HI> twice mi&s;t the <HI>Maderas,</HI> and returned home to the great dammage of the Owners.</P>
<P>And where &s;uch Currents are if you &s;tem them, the di&s;tance run will be le&s;s then it is by E&s;timation, but if you &s;ayl with them, it will be much more, and proportionally it will be le&s;s or more, if you cro&s;s it eitheir directly or obliquely, according as it &s;ets with or again&s;t your intended Cour&s;e.</P>

<P>Whereto we may adde, that the Refraction of the Sun, e&s;pecially in Winter, makes his Altitude or Height &s;eem greater then it is, which is cau&s;ed by the gro&s;s va|pours and thickne&s;s of the Air near the Horizon, this we may allude to after this manner: Set down an empty Ba&s;on on a Stool, laying a &s;hilling at the bottom thereof, and go &s;o much backwards, till you bring the edge of the Ba&s;on and the &s;hilling in a right line with your Eye, and then let another fill the Ba&s;on with fair water, and you may go a pretty way further backward, and &s;till &s;ee the &s;hilling and the edge of the Ba&s;on in a right line, the refraction of the water being the cau&s;e thereof; and from this Rea&s;on we conclude, That the Sun &s;eems to appear above the Horizon when he is really &s;et.</P>
<P>This is confirmed al&s;o by many Experiments, we may recite one: A certain Dutch Ship being upon the Di&s;covery of a North|ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> was con&s;trained to winter in the I&s;land of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> where after the Sun had been for divers moneths under the Horizon, the Mariners beheld the whole body of the Sun iu&s;t above the Horizon 14 days &s;ooner then according to his Declination he &s;hould appeare, and by Computation was then at lea&s;t 5 degrees under the Horizon; Al&s;o at other times, e&s;pecially in winter, he appears to be higher then he is, for which there are Tables of Allowance, as al&s;o for the Parralax and height of the eye in <HI>Mr. Wrights Correction of Errors in Navigation,</HI> wherefore tho&s;e that come from the South-wards, expecting to fall in with the <HI>Lands-end,</HI> or <HI>Lizard,</HI> are to be admoni&s;hed that in tru&s;ting to the Ob&s;erved Latitude, they do not e&s;timate them&s;elves more to the Southwards then really they are, and &s;o incur danger through pre&s;umption; but this erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> is &s;omewhat abated by the
<PB N="5" REF="37"> height of the eye above the water, ob&s;erving the Sun with <HI>Davis</HI> his Quadrant backward in a Horizon more northwardly then the true one: Notwith&s;tanding the imperfections and uncertainties that ari&s;e in the practick part, yet it &s;hould be our endeavour to render this excellent Art as ea&s;ie and certain as we can, which is the thing I aim at, and the In&s;trument here u&s;ed being the <HI>Plaine Scale,</HI> is, as I &s;aid before, in every mans power, if he have Com|pa&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Our Engli&s;h or Italian Mile by which we reckon at Sea, contains 1000 paces, and each pace five foot, and every foot 12 inches. The 120^t^h part of that Mile is 41&frac23; feet, and &s;o much is the &s;pace betweene the Knots upon the Log-line: So many Knots as the Ship runs in half a minute, &s;o many Miles &s;he &s;ayleth in an hour; or &s;o many Leagues, and &s;o many Miles &s;he runneth in a Watch or
<PB N="10" REF="40"> four hours, called <HI>A Watch,</HI> becau&s;e one half of the Ships Com|pany watcheth by turns, and changes every four hours.</P>
<P><HI>Example</HI></P>
<P>Six Knots in half a minute is &s;ix Miles in an hour, or &s;ix Leagues &s;ix Miles in a Watch, which is eight Leagues or twenty four Miles in all.</P>
<P>Every Noon the Ma&s;ter and his Mates take the reckoning off the Log-board, and double the Knots run, and then divide the Pro|duct, which is the number of Miles run by three, the quotient is the Leagues run &s;ince the former Noon, and according to cu&s;tom the Log is thrown every two hours, and I never knew the cour&s;e nea|rer expre&s;&s;ed on the Log-board, then to half a point of the Com|pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his excellent Book, called, <HI>The Sea-mans Practi&s;e,</HI> &s;heweth, That according to a late exact Experiment of his, which &s;eemes to be very &s;atisfactory, and confirmed by many other Experiments, that in ordinary Practi&s;e at Sea we cannot, if we will yield Truth the conque&s;t, allow le&s;s then 360000 of our Engli&s;h feet to vary one degree of Latitude upon the earth, in &s;ayling North or South under any Meridian, according to which account there will be in a degree of our Statute mea&s;ure 68 2/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Miles, each Mile containing 5280 feet, and of the common Sea-mea&s;ure, allowing 5000 feet to a Mile, there will be 72 Miles, or 24 Leagues in a degree, which we &s;hall take to be the truth.</P>
<P>A reckoning being kept in degrees, and Cente&s;ms or hundredth parts of a degree, is a ready way, and well approved by Mr. <HI>Nor|wood</HI> in his &s;aid <HI>Sea-mans Practi&s;e;</HI> as al&s;o by Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> in his <HI>Geometrical Seaman,</HI> who wholly u&s;eth this mea&s;ure, and yet the Mariner may very well refrain this mea&s;ure, if he will keep his reckoning in Leagues and tenths, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew. Now to &s;hew this mea&s;ure, the Logline mu&s;t have a knot placed at every 30 foot length, and as many of tho&s;e as run out in half a Minute, &s;o many Cente&s;ms or hundredth parts of a degree the &s;hip &s;ayleth in an hour, and for every three foot more you are to allow the tenth part of a Cente&s;m, or the one thou&s;andth part of a degree.</P>
<P>But if you would have it to &s;hew the Miles of a true degree, allowing but 60 to a degree, the mile mu&s;t be enlarged propor|tionally, and the di&s;tance between every one of the Knots mu&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="40"> be 50 foot and as many of tho&s;e as run out in half Minute, &s;o many Miles or Minutes the &s;hip &s;aileth in an hour, and for every foot more you mu&s;t allow the tenth part of a mile more and if Sea-men be de&s;irous to retain their former cu&s;tom of reckon|ing the &s;hips way in Leagues, then mu&s;t either the &s;aid reckoning be reduced into degrees and Cente&s;ms of degrees by Arithmetick, becau&s;e the degrees of Latitude on the Plain Chart, and of Longi|tude and Latitude on <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> are divided, and that mo&s;t conveniently into 10 parts, and each part &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided into 10 more, or el&s;e &s;uch a Scale of equal parts over and above mu&s;t be added to each Chart, wherein a degree of Latitude in the Plain Chart, and of Longitude in <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> mu&s;t be divided into 20 equal parts, and the labor of reducing by the Pen, will be &s;aved; or the adding of any &s;uch Scale, may very well be &s;pared and otherwi&s;e &s;upplied, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew.</P>

<HEAD>Of Reduction by the Pen.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Miles and their Decimals parts, are reduced into Leagues and tenths of Leagues, by dividing by three: Here note, that the tenth part of any mea&s;ure is expre&s;&s;ed either with a Comma or point before it, or el&s;e with a &s;eparating line thus, 3 or &decimalL;3 either way, the figure 3 &s;ignifies three parts of any thing divided into ten, and &decimalL;35 &s;ignifies thirty five parts of any thing divided into one hundred, and generally in this Decimal Arithmetick, the Denomi|nator is under&s;tood to be an unit, with as many cyphers following it, as there are units in the Numerator; thus &decimalL;003 &s;ignifies three parts of one thou&s;and.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>375 &decimalL;6 Miles divided by 3, makes 125 &decimalL;2 Leagues, and on the contrary, 135 &decimalL;2 Leagues multiplyed by 3, makes 375 &decimalL;6 Miles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Leagues and their Decimals parts, are reduced into degrees and Cente&s;mes, by &s;eparating one figure from the whole Leagues towards the left hand, and dividing the whole by 2.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>271 &decimalL;8 Leagues &s;eparated, will &s;tand thus, 27 &decimalL;18 and then divi|ded by two, the quotient is 13 &decimalL;59, that is 13 degrees and 59 Cen|te&s;ms, or hundredth parts of a degree more.</P>
<P>On the contrary degrees and cente&s;ms are deduced into Leagues,
<PB N="12" REF="41"> and their Decimal parts, by placing the Comma after the fir&s;t Decimal part, toward the right hand, and then multiplying the whole by two: thus the former number of degrees are to be expre&s;|&s;ed 135, 9 which multiplyed by two, makes 271 &decimalL;8 leagues, as be|fore.</P>
<P N="3">3. Minutes, whereof there are 60 in a degree, are reduced into Cente&s;imals by annexing a Cipher thereto, and dividing by 6: thus 27 Minutes with a Cipher, make 270, which divided by 6, gives in the quotient 45 Cente&s;ms, here after 27 was divided by 6, the quotient was 4, and 3 remaining with the Cipher is 30, which divided by 6, the quotient is 5.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Cente&s;mes of a degree are reduced into Minutes, by multiplying them by 6, and cutting off the la&s;t figure: thus, 75 Cente&s;mes multiplyed by 6, make 450, which is 45 minutes.</P>
<P>This trouble, as I &s;aid before, is taken away by fitted Scales by the View onely, if they &s;tand back to back, as in the Scales of equal parts on the Plain Scale, where 75 Cente&s;mes in the le&s;&s;er Scale of equal parts, &s;tands again&s;t 45 parts or Minutes in the greater Scale of equal parts, and thus when the Latitudes of two places are given in degrees and minutes, the minutes are to be turned or reduced into Cente&s;mes.</P>
<P>And &s;o in the example of the former Chart, the line A B con|taining 10 degrees, is divided into 20 parts, and one of tho&s;e parts into 10 others, which I call, <HI>The Scale of Leagues of a true degree,</HI> then becau&s;e the whole di&s;tance T N is too long to be mea&s;ured at once, I fir&s;t mea&s;ure 10 degrees or 200 Leagues from T to C, and then C N mea&s;ured on the Leagues, is 71 leagues and eight tenths more, and on the cente&s;imal degrees, is 3 degrees 59 Cente&s;mes.</P>
<P>So that the whole di&s;tance is 271 Leagues eight tenths, or 13 degrees 59 Cente&s;mes, which is thus expre&s;&s;ed 13^d, 59: or thus, 13^d &decimalL;59: or thus, 13^d 59/100: and when we &s;peak of minutes which are marked thus 1&prime;, we alwayes pre&s;ume there are but 60 of them in a degree.</P>

<HEAD>How to Rectifie the Account when the dead Latitude differs from the Ob&s;erved Latitude.</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>Dead Latitude,</HI> is meant the Latitude in which the Ship is by the <HI>Dead Reckoning</HI> or <HI>E&s;timation,</HI> and this is always given, as in the former Chart between <HI>Tenariff</HI> and <HI>St. Nicholas I&s;land,</HI> by the points 1, 2, 3, in the South-line, if they be mea&s;ured in the other &s;ide of the Chart among&s;t the degrees of Latitude.</P>
<P>The whole Practi&s;e of the art of Navigation in keeping a due reckoning, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of three Members or Branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. An experienced judgement in e&s;timating the Ships way in her Cour&s;e upon every &s;hift of Wind, allowing for Leeward-way and Currents.</P>
<P N="2">2. In duly e&s;timating the Cour&s;e or Point of the Compa&s;s on which the Ship hath made her way good, allowing for Currents and the Variation of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the frequent and due Ob&s;erving the Latitude.</P>
<P>The reckoning ari&s;ing out of the two former Branches, is called the <HI>Dead Reckoning,</HI> and of the&s;e three Branches there ought to be &s;uch an harmony and con&s;ent, that any two being given, a third Conclu&s;ion may be thence rai&s;ed with truth.</P>
<P>As namely, from the Cour&s;e and di&s;tance, to find the Latitude of the Ships place.</P>
<P>Or by the Cour&s;e and difference of Latitude, to finde the di|&s;tance; or by the difference of Latitude and di&s;tance, to finde the Cour&s;e: But in the mid&s;t of &s;o many uncertainties that daily occur in the practi&s;e of Navigation, a joynt Con&s;ent in the&s;e three par|ticulars is hardly to be expected, and when an error ari&s;eth, the &s;ole remedy to be tru&s;ted to, is the ob&s;ervation of the Latitude, or
<PB N="22" REF="46"> the known Soundings when a Ship is near land, and how to rectifie the Reckoning by the ob&s;erved latitude, we &s;hall now &s;hew.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that will not yeild unto truth in this particular, that a bout 24 of our common Engli&s;h Sea leagues are to be allowed to vary a degree of latitude under the Meridian, do put them&s;elves into a double incapacity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in &s;ailing directly North or South under the Meridian where there is no Current, finding their Reckoning to fall &s;hort of the ob&s;erved latitude, they take it to be an error in their judge|ment in concluding the Ships way by E&s;timation or gue&s;s to be too little.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, if there be a Current that helps &s;et them forward, that there is a near agreement between the ob&s;erved and the dead latitude, they conclude there is no &s;uch Current.</P>
<P>Or la&s;tly, if they &s;tem the Current, they conclude it to be much &s;wifter then in truth it is, and thus one error commonly begets another, but &s;uppo&s;ing a conformity to the truth, we &s;hall pre&s;cribe four Precepts for correcting a &s;imple or &s;ingle Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Prec.</HI> I. Fir&s;t therfore, if a &s;hip &s;ail under the Meridian, if the dif|ference of latitude be le&s;s by e&s;timation then it is by ob&s;ervation, the Ships place or Variation onely is to be corrected and enlarged under the Meridian, and the error i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be imputed either to the judgement in gue&s;&s;ing at the di&s;tance run, in making it too little, or if the &s;aid di&s;tance be gue&s;&s;ed at by a &s;ound and experienced judgement, you may &s;uppo&s;e you &s;tem &s;ome Current.</P>
<P>So if a Ship &s;aile from A in the latitude of 28^d directly South 48, &s;uch leagues whereof 20 are a degree, the difference of lati|tude is 2 degrees 24 minutes, each league being 3 minutes, by this e&s;timate the Ship &s;hould be at B, but if the ob&s;erved latitude be but 25 degrees, the reckoning being amended, the Ships place is at the point D, and in this Scheme we have made every degree of latitude to be twice as large as it was in the former Chart, and &s;o the degrees of latitude in that Chart will become a Scale of leagues to this.</P>
<P>But if the difference of latitude be more by E&s;timation, then it is by ob&s;ervation, either the judgement erres in &s;uppo&s;ing the di&s;tance run to be too much: in this ca&s;e the di&s;tance is to be &s;hortned, and the Ships place corrected, according to the ob&s;erved
<PB N="23" REF="46"> latitude under the Meridian; &s;o if a &s;hip &s;ayle South from A in the Latitude of 28^d, till &s;he hath varied her latitude 2^d 24&prime; by E&s;timation, being at the Point B in the latitude of 25^d 36&prime;, if the ob&s;erved latitude be 26^d, the Ships place being corrected by this Ob&s;ervation, will be in the Point E, and not at B.</P>
<P>Or if you can pre&s;ume upon the truth of your judgement, and finde it &s;o to happen, commonly that the di&s;tance run is more then you can make it by ob&s;ervation, you may well &s;uppo&s;e you cro&s;s &s;ome Current which &s;ets either Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward, but can|not tell which until you come near &s;ome Land, to &s;ee which way the ripples of Water &s;et, or are informed by the experience of others.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing the di&s;tance and difference of Latitude to be true, you are to conclude the Ship hath made her way good not North or South under the Meridian, but upon &s;ome other point of the Compa&s;s, either Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward: let us &s;up|po&s;e We&s;tward, the Rumbe it &s;elf need not be drawn in the Chart, wherefore in the Chart or Traver&s;e-quadrant, having

<P><HI>Precept</HI> II. But &s;uppo&s;ing no Current, if the &s;hip &s;ayl upon one of the five Rumbes next the Meridian, if the <HI>Dead Latitude</HI> dif|fer from the <HI>Ob&s;erved Latitude,</HI> the error is in mi&s;-judging the di|&s;tance run, which is either to be enlarged or &s;hortned, as the ca&s;e requires.</P>
<P>In the former Scheme, &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip &s;ayl from A South-we&s;t and by South 48 leagues, being by e&s;timation at C in the latitude of 26^d, but if the latitude by ob&s;ervation be but 25^d 36&prime;, &s;uppo&s;e at B, then a line drawn through B, parallel to A W, cro&s;&s;eth the line of the &s;hips cour&s;e at M, which is the corrected Point where the &s;hip is, and hereby the Di&s;tance is enlarged, the extent A M being 57, 7 leagues, that is 57 leagues, and a little above two mile more.</P>
<P>In like manner if the Ship had &s;ayled about 72 leagues on that cour&s;e, and were by e&s;timation at the Point G in the latitude of 25^d, and by the ob&s;ervation the latitude were found to be 25^d 36&prime;, in this ca&s;e the &s;hips di&s;tance is to be &s;hortned, by drawing the afore&s;aid line B M parallel to A W, which cro&s;&s;eth the line of the &s;hips cour&s;e at M, which is now the corrected Point of the &s;hips place.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e In&s;tances may be performed on the Chart, by finding out the &s;eparation or we&s;twardly di&s;tance proper to the corrected latitude without drawing any lines, and that by help of the Traver&s;e-Quadrant, <HI>page</HI> 13. in which C B there, is made equal to A B the difference of latitude here, then in the &s;aid

<P>But in the&s;e ca&s;es, if the judgement &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;ome Cur|rent, and can depend upon the ob&s;erved difference of Latitude and dead Di&s;tance, as both true, then the Departure from the Meridian may be found, as in the la&s;t caution of the former Pre|cept, whereby the error will be imputed to the Rumbe, which al|ters by rea&s;on of the &s;uppo&s;ed Current.</P>
<P><HI>Precept</HI> III. But in Rumbes near the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, if the dead latitude differ from the ob&s;erved latitude, the error is to be im|puted either wholly to the Rumbe, or partly to the Rumbe, partly to the Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If wholly to the Rumbe, then retain the ob&s;erved difference of latitude, and the e&s;timated di&s;tance, and finde the Separation or Departure from the Meridian, as was done in the la&s;t Caution of the fir&s;t Ca&s;e or Precept.</P>
<P>But if the judgement would allot the error partly to the Rum|be, partly to the Di&s;tance, retain the ob&s;erved difference of lati|tude; and for the Departure from the Meridian, let it be the &s;ame as it was made by the Dead Reckoning.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>So if a &s;hip &s;ayl We&s;t and by South half a point Southerly 68, 9 leagues, that is 68 leagues and nine tenths, from the latitude of 28^d from A to H, and by the Dead Reckoning &s;hould be in the latitude of 27^d; if the latitude by ob&s;ervation be 27^d 20&prime;, which will happen at the point I: In this ca&s;e, if the error were wholly imputed to the di&s;tance, the line I K being drawn parallel to A W, would cut off and &s;horten the di&s;tance as much as the mea|&s;ure of K H, which is 23 leagues, which becau&s;e it &s;eems ab&s;urd and improbable, is not to be admitted of; wherefore imputing the error to the Rumbe onely, place one foot of the extent A H in I, and with the other cro&s;s the line A W at T, and &s;o is A T
<PB N="26" REF="48"> the Departure from the Meridian required, whereby the Rumbe line, if it were drawn, would be altered to pa&s;s through the cro&s;s at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>But according to the la&s;t Caution of this Precept, if you judge the error to be partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Di&s;tance, prick the Departure by the Dead Reckoning F H, from A to V, and &s;o by help of the points of Variation I, and Separation V, you may draw a new Rumbe line, and finde the quantity thereof; as al&s;o of the &s;hortned di&s;tance by the direction for platting a Traver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Precept</HI> IV. If a Ship &s;ayl directly Ea&s;t or We&s;t, and the dead and ob&s;erved Latitude do both agree, the Reckoning cannot be corrected.</P>
<P>But if they differ, the error is either partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Di&s;tance, in which ca&s;e retaining the Separation or We&s;twardly Di&s;tance the &s;ame, the difference of Latitude is the Variation required, whereby a new Rumbe-line might be drawn if it were needful.</P>
<P>But if by frequent ob&s;ervation you finde the Ship is &s;till carried from the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, either Northwards or Southwards, you may conclude &s;ome Current to be the cau&s;e thereof, in which ca&s;e re|taining the di&s;tance to be the &s;ame it was by the Dead Reckoning, and the difference of Latitude to be the &s;ame you found it by ob|&s;ervation, finde the Departure from the Meridian by former di|rections, whereby the Ships Rumbe or Cour&s;e might be drawn if it were needful: It is not nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s Examples, if what before is written be well under&s;tood, e&s;pecially in this ca&s;e where all directions are &s;lippery.</P>
<P>Thus in imitation of <HI>Maetius</HI> a Hollander, though a Latine Au|thor, we have pre&s;cribed &s;everal rules for the correction of a &s;ingle Cour&s;e, which Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> in his <HI>Geometrical Sea-man</HI> makes but one rule, retaining always the &s;ame Cour&s;e, and correcting the di|&s;tance run therein, by drawing a parallel through the ob&s;erved La|titude, and &s;o for many Cour&s;es they are fir&s;t brought all into one line, and the di&s;tance corrected by the &s;ame rule.</P>
<P>But concerning it, we mu&s;t give a double Caution: Fir&s;t, that no three places can be laid down true in their Cour&s;es and Di|&s;tances from each other on the Plain Chart, as &s;hall afterwards be
<PB N="27" REF="48"> handled, however the error in &s;mall di&s;tances will be incon|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly admitting they could, the &s;aid general Direction is un&s;ound, but the nearer the truth the nearer the Cour&s;es are to the Meridian, and when all the Cour&s;es do either increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the Latitude, but very erronious when &s;ome Cour&s;es in|crea&s;e and others le&s;&s;en the Latitude; in all which Ca&s;es it is mo&s;t &s;afe to allot to the Variation or dead Difference of Latitude, of every Cour&s;e its proportional &s;hare of the whole error between the Dead and Ob&s;erved Latitude, and then to correct each cour&s;e by the former directions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore in the following Chart, let us &s;uppo&s;e a Ship to &s;ayl from A in the Latitude of 28^d South South-we&s;t, almo&s;t 65 leagues to B, this Cour&s;e is &s;et off in the Arch E F, and by the Dead Reckoning &s;he &s;hould now be in the Latitude of 25^d.</P>
<P>Again, from B &s;he &s;ayls South-we&s;t and by We&s;t 72 leagues to C, which Cour&s;e being three points from the We&s;t, is &s;et off in the Arch G H, and now by the dead Reckoning &s;he &s;hould be in the Latitude of 23 degrees, whereas by a good ob&s;ervation &s;he is found to be in the Latitude of 23^d 30&prime;; wherefore to correct this Reckoning draw the line C A, which is the compound Cour&s;e ari&s;ing from the two former Cour&s;es, and through the parallel of ob&s;erved Latitude, draw L K parallel to A W, &s;o is the point K the corrected point of the Ships place, according to Mr. <HI>Phil|lips,</HI> and agreeing with the truth, as we have fitted the Ex|ample.</P>
<P>But now as to the other way of correcting a compound Cour&s;e, it is to be done by this Proportion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t finde the Variation or Difference of Latitude proper to each Cour&s;e, then it holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the &s;um of all the Variations or Differences of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the whole error between the Dead and Ob&s;erved Latitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is each particular Difference of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To its proportional &s;hare of the whole error</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e A S is the &s;um of all the Differences of Latitude, and S L is the whole error between the dead and ob&s;erved Lati|tude, therewith upon S as a Center, de&s;cribe an Ark at M, and draw the line A M ju&s;t touching the outward edge of the &s;aid
<FIGURE>
<PB N="28" REF="49">
</FIGURE> Ark, then the neare&s;t di&s;tance between E and the &s;aid line, is the error in the dead latitude at the fir&s;t Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Then if the differences of Latitude fall all the &s;ame way, if the the e&s;timated difference of Latitude be too much, you mu&s;t abate out of each dead Latitude its proportional error, &s;o in this ca&s;e the &s;aid error is prickt from E to N.</P>
<P>But when the e&s;timated difference of Latitude is too little, the proportional error mu&s;t be added to each difference of Latitude, then prick the &s;econd dead difference of Latitude being equal to E S, from N to O, and place the &s;aid extent from A the Center,
<PB N="29" REF="49"> to Y, and take the neare&s;t di&s;tance to M A as before, and prick it from O to L, being the &s;econd error: this is needful when there are more Cour&s;es then two, but for the la&s;t Cour&s;e not at all nece&s;&s;ary, neither is it for this; then through the point N draw the line N F parallel to A W, &s;o is F the corrected Point of the Ships place at the fir&s;t Cour&s;e, then draw F K parallel to B C, and where the parallel of Latitude cuts it as at K, is the corrected Point of the Ships place at the &s;econd Cour&s;e, being the &s;ame we found it before the other way.</P>
<P>But in &s;tead of the &s;econd Cour&s;e and di&s;tance, which was 72 Leagues South-we&s;t and by we&s;t, let us now &s;uppo&s;e the Ship &s;ayls the &s;ame di&s;tance from the point B North-we&s;t and by we&s;t, which Cour&s;e being as much on the other &s;ide the we&s;t, make G I equal to G H, and draw the Cour&s;e B I, therein pricking off the for|mer di&s;tance to D, &s;o is D the point of the Ships dead reckoning in the Latitude of 27^d; and now &s;uppo&s;ing the ob&s;erved Latitude to be 27^d 30&prime;, the error and difference of Latitude are as much now as they were before; wherefore draw D A the compound rumbe: draw Q T parallel to A W, &amp; where it cuts the compound rumbe as at P, by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Phillips</HI> his reckoning, is the corrected point of the Ships place at the end of the &s;econd Cour&s;e, whereas in truth it &s;hould happen at T, and &s;o P bears from A, in this exam|ple 76^d 43&prime; from the Meridian, and is di&s;tant from it 43 Leagues and a half, whereas the Ships true Cour&s;e from A to T, is 83^d 32&prime; from the Meridian, and the di&s;tance almo&s;t 89 leagues, which is very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Now for as much as the Sum of the differences of Latitude A E and E <HI>f,</HI> in this latter example, is equal to A S in the former ex|ample, al&s;o the error <HI>f</HI> Q here, is equal to S L there, therefore the proportional part of each error will be the &s;ame as before.</P>
<P>Then if &s;ome Cour&s;es decrea&s;e the Latitude Southwardly, and others increa&s;e it North-wardly, if the dead Latitude be too little, as in this example, con&s;ider that to place the Ship more North-wardly, &s;o as to allot to each difference of Latitude its proper error, that the South-wardly differences of Latitude mu&s;t be de|crea&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened, and the North-wardly increa&s;ed; wherefore the proportion of the error is placed from E to N, and the Point F found as before.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="50">
<P>In like manner, if the dead Latitude were too much to bring the Ship more South-wardly, the Southern differences of Latitude mu&s;t be increa&s;ed, and the Northern decrea&s;ed, now the point T is found by drawing a line from F the corrected point of the fir&s;t Cour&s;e, parallel to B D, and &s;o the line F V being equal to B D, is the Ships &s;econd Cour&s;e and di&s;tance from the corrected point F, then in regard part of the error in the Latitude is &s;uppo&s;ed to be committed, as well in the latter as in the former Cour&s;e, which error being too little, the di&s;tance F V is to be enlarged, and where the parallel of ob&s;erved Latitude cuts it, as at T, is the cor|rected point of the Ships place at the end of the &s;econd Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And though what we have here performed be done by the draw|ing of many Lines, yet by help of the Traver&s;e-quadrant it may may be in&s;erted into the Chart, without drawing any Lines therein at all, for in each the Cour&s;e and corrected Difference of Lati|tude is given; and that two things are &s;ufficient to di&s;patch the work, we have &s;hewed before.</P>

<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t therefore, I &s;ay that no two places can be laid down true upon the Plain Chart, in re&s;pect of Longitude, Latitude, Cour&s;e, and di&s;tance, unle&s;s they be under the &s;ame Meridian, or under the Equinoctial.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. No two places can be laid down true in the&s;e three re&s;pects, as to their Cour&s;e, Di&s;tance, and Difference of Longitude, but if you would lay them down true in two of the&s;e re&s;pects, whereof there are three Ca&s;es: Fir&s;t, in their Cour&s;e and Di&s;tance, then the Difference of Latitude will be true, and the Difference of Longi|tude fal&s;e, as in the &s;econd Ca&s;e. Secondly, in their Cour&s;e and Difference of Longitude, then will the Di&s;tance and Difference of Latitude be much more then it &s;hould; the Di&s;tance thus found will be 1860 leagues, and the difference of Latitude 65^d 3&prime;, and &s;hould be but 26^d 40&prime;. Thirdly, to lay them down true in their Di&s;tance and Difference of Longitude, in many Ca&s;es is im|po&s;&s;ible, and in this Example; but yet where the Difference of Latitude is more then the Difference of Longitude, this may be
<PB N="34" REF="52"> done, but then the Difference of Latitude will always be too lit|tle, and the Rumbe too wide from the Meridian.</P>
<P N="4">4. Three places cannot be laid down true, as to their Latitudes, Cour&s;es and Di&s;tances from each other, though we wave the Lon|gitude, as &s;hall afterwards be &s;hewed; from which premi&s;es we may rai&s;e the&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in regard three places cannot be laid down true in their Cour&s;es, Di&s;tances and Latitudes, although we wave and ad|mit the Difference of Longitude to be fal&s;e, that it is no &s;afe way to make Charts, as generally they are, to be true as to the Lati|tudes of places, and as near the truth as they can as to the Cour|&s;es and Di&s;tances, for out of &s;uch a fal&s;e Chart a true one cannot be made, nor the true rumbe and di&s;tance between mo&s;t places found.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it were be&s;t to make the&s;e Charts true, as to the Lon|gitudes and Latitudes of all places, in regard the true rumbe and di&s;tance may be thence ea&s;ily found, as we &s;hall &s;hew; and an|other true Chart or Globe graduated from them, and that in &s;tead of putting in &s;uch abundance of Compa&s;&s;es and Rumbe-lines, both in the <HI>Plain</HI> and <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> it were better to leave them out, and to put into &s;ome &s;pare place the Traver&s;e-quadrant with points and half points, and a Limbe divided into degrees, with a Line of Sines, or el&s;e the Sines of the points, halfs, and quarters onely.</P>

<P>But now, as for finding the Meridional parts between the two former Latitudes, in one or both Hemi&s;pheres, the middle Lati|tude in one Hemi&s;phere will be 60^d, and the Meridional parts 40^d, 00, and in both Hemi&s;pheres if found at once by the middle Latitude, which is 10^d, is 121^d, 85; or if found &s;everally at twice, 140^d, 616, which varying from the truth, as above ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the Sum and Difference, we may conclude, that the Proportion is very un&s;ound and intolerable for any great differ|ence of Latitude, but Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Works deliver no Caution a|bout it: Before we can finde the di&s;tance, the Rumbe mu&s;t be calculated, and if that be fal&s;e, a &s;mall error therein may cau&s;e a con&s;iderable error in the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Where the difference of Latitude is not above five degrees, it may &s;erve very well near the truth from the Equinoctial to 60^d of Latitude, and afterwards to 80^d; it will not &s;erve for three de|grees difference of Latitude, and in all Ca&s;es the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude is a tearm too great, the middle Latitude being too &s;mall, and I think no certain Rule can be given to correct it.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid, the Reader may take due Caution how far to depend upon &s;uch Proportions, whereof one tearm is the middle Latitude: &s;uch are,</P>
<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude: To the Radius</HI> &proportion;</P>

<P>And to this Proportion Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> his late Table of Secants

<P>This he doth not in&s;i&s;t upon as ab&s;olutely true, but yet leaves it uncertain when to u&s;e it, and when not, the half Sum of the Co&s;ines is a tearm &s;omewhat near in many Ca&s;es to the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude, and by the like rea&s;on this Proportion may be refuted, as that was; the half &s;um of the Co&s;ines is a tearm that may very well &s;erve near the truth for 10 degrees difference of Latitude, or more between the Latitudes of 20^d and 60^d, near the Poles it is too great, in which ca&s;e the geometrical mean is truer, near the Equinoctial, and generally in both Hemi|&s;pheres it is too &s;mall; and this I thought fit to adde, that tho&s;e that u&s;e geometrical Schemes derived from the&s;e Proportions, may not be mi&s;-led, and after a trouble&s;ome manner the Cour&s;e and di&s;tance in the <HI>Seamans Calendar</HI> is laid down between two places, in effect from this latter Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tion: and for the performance of what is there done, the Scale of Longitudes was formerly added to the Plain Scale, that thereby we might finde how many miles in every Latitude would an&s;wer to one degree of Longitude, and thence by Proportion obtain the di&s;tance between two places that differ onely in Longitude, which way is tedious. And for finding how many miles in any Latitude vary one degree of Longitude (if it were needful) is ea&s;ily performed by the Plain Scale, as I have now contrived it; take the Complement of the Latitude from the greater Scale of Sines, and mea&s;ure it in the greater Scale of leagues or equal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>So if the Latitude were 52^d, the Complement thereof is 38^d, and the Sine thereof mea&s;ured in the greater Scale makes 37, and &s;o many miles or minutes in that Latitude alter one degree of Longitude, which on the other Scale of equal parts, &s;hewes 61 Cente&s;mes of a degree.</P>
<P>And before I apply my &s;elf to &s;mall Di&s;tances, I think it not ami&s;s to expre&s;s how the&s;e Proportions finde the Rumbe between <HI>Horn Sound</HI> and <HI>Fog Bay.</HI></P>

<P>By the half &s;um of the Co&s;ines of both Latitudes, the Rumbe is 47^d 28&prime; from the Meridian, and the Di&s;tance about 789 leagues.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="54">
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e places to be in different Hemi&s;pheres, the middle Latitude will be the half difference of both Latitudes: And by the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude, the Rumbe is 27 de|grees 2 minutes. and the Di&s;tance is 2842 leagues.</P>
<P>By the half &s;um of the Co&s;ines of both Latitudes, the Rumbe is 12 degrees 54 minutes, and the Di&s;tance 2598 leagues, whereas in this latter Ca&s;e the truth by <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> is 20 degrees 11 minutes from the Meridian for the Rumbe, and 2699 leagues for the Di&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>How Geometrically to &s;upply the Meridian-line of <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> generally.</HEAD>
<P>That the finding of the true Rumbe between two places, might not be a Propo&s;ition out of the reach of Geometry, or not to be per|formed by Scale and Compa&s;&s;es, the &s;upply thereof became the Contemplation of the late learned Mr. <HI>Samuel For&s;ter</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomie in <HI>Gre&s;ham Colledge,</HI> who in his Treati&s;e of a ruler, Entituled, <HI>Po&s;thuma Fo&s;teri,</HI> makes a Meridian-line out of a Scale of Secants: this we &s;hall be brief in, and &s;hew how near it comes to the truth. Let it be required to make a Meridian-line of &s;uch a &s;cantling, that one degree of Longitude may be half an inch, which is of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Print thereof at the end of the Book.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="56">
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Make a quadrant as A C B, wherein prick down half an inch from C to D, and rai&s;e the Perpendicular D E: Sup|po&s;e I would take out the Se|cant of 43^d 30&prime; to that Ra|dius, prick this arch down from B in the Limbe towards E, and lay a ruler over it, and it will cut the Line D E at F, then is D F the Tangent of that Arch to half an inch Ra|dius, and C F the Secant thereof. After this manner the Secant of any Arch is to be taken out, I &s;ay then that the Secant of 30&prime; thus taken out, &s;hall be the length of the fir&s;t degree of the Meridian-line, and the Secant of 1^d 30&prime; &s;o taken out, &s;hall reach from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd degree of the Meridian-line, and the Secant of 2^d 30&prime; &s;hall be the di&s;tance between the &s;econd and third degree of the Meri|dian-line, and &s;o on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively through every degree to 80^d or 85^d, and further we do not need it.</P>
<P>And &s;o if it were required to make the Meridian-line from 43^d to 50^d of Latitude, the former extent C F out of the quadrant &s;hall reach in this line F L from 43^d to 44, in like manner the Secant of 44^d 30&prime; &s;o taken out, &s;hall reach from 44^d to 45.</P>
<P>And thus may the whole degrees be taken out, now for dividing them into Cente&s;mes, they may be equal divi&s;ions, and yet very near the truth; or rather fir&s;t divide the half degrees true by the middle Secant, thus: the half of the Se|cant of 49^d 15&prime;, &s;hall reach from 49^d to 49^d and a half, and in&s;tead of halfing the Secant, it may be taken out to half the Radius, and afterwards the parts of each half degree may be divided equally, and &s;o if you would divide a degree in|to ten parts, each part will be 6 minutes; and if it were required to finde the true length of the Meridian-line from 49 degrees to 49 degrees 6 minutes, the tenth part of the middle Secant, to wit, of 49 degrees 3 minutes, &s;hall be the
<PB N="44" REF="57"> length required, and &s;o on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. And &s;o if it were requi|red to finde the length of 49^d 7 tenths, or 42&prime;, I &s;ay that 7/10 of the middle Secant, to wit, of the Secant of 49 35 Cente&s;ms, or 49^d 21&prime;, is the length required.</P>
<P>Now it may be doubted that the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, is not near enough the truth, in regard the Ta|bles at fir&s;t were made by the adding of the Secants of every mi|nute &s;ucce&s;&s;ively together; and the learned Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> in &s;tead of adding the Secants of every minute, would have a minute divi|ded into a hundred, a thou&s;and, ten thou&s;and, or rather a million of parts, and the Secants of every one of tho&s;e parts added to|gether.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, That the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, and in the whole, doth not breed any error at all to be regarded, compared with the making of it up &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by every minute, and for each particular degree it doth not breed any &s;en&s;ible error, compared with the be&s;t Tables.</P>
<P>To the end of this Book we have added a Table of the Meri|dian-line to every &s;econd Cente&s;m, wherein we have &s;upplied the vacuity that is in Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Table, by which Table it doth ap|pear that the Meridional parts between the Latitudes of 50 de|grees and 60 degrees, are 17^d &decimalL;542, which other Tables make more; and by the adding up of the Secants of 51 degrees 30 minutes, 52 degrees 30 minutes, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to 59 degrees 30 minutes they will amount to 17^d, 547, the difference being onely in the thou&s;andth parts of a degree; and I &s;uppo&s;e there are no <HI>Merca|tors Charts</HI> made, wherein a degree of Longitude is an inch, the bigge&s;t, I have &s;een is but half an inch, and if they were an inch it could &s;carcely be divided into one hundred parts, much le&s;s in|to a thou&s;and, and &s;o in every part of the Meridian-line as far as it can be u&s;ed, the difference will be incon&s;iderable, and &s;o al&s;o in the whole.</P>

<P>And for the latter part of the Objection, I hear Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> was making a New Table of them, according to his own minde, wherein it is probable he attained the manner of adding up tho&s;e Secants by &s;ome new Propo&s;ition, in regard it would be extreamly tedious to make a Table of Natural Secants to all tho&s;e parts and then adde them up, wherein he long &s;ince de&s;i&s;ted upon this con&s;ideration, that the decrea&s;e would happen in the decimal parts remote from the degrees; for it mu&s;t be conceived that a Table of the Meridian-line con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;um of all the Secants divided by Radius; and thus the Meridional number for the fir&s;t thou&s;and Cente&s;ms, or ten degrees, added up from a Table who&s;e Radius is 1000, amounts to 1005079, and divided by the Radius is 1005, 079, then becau&s;e we would have a Table to expre&s;s the Meridian-line in degrees, allowing 100 cente&s;ms to a degree, we mu&s;t divide the former Number by 100, and the Quotient is 10, 05079, which is the very Number in our Tables, &s;aving that our Table is not continued &s;o far by two places; and for the la&s;t two figures which are omitted, we added in an Unit in the third place of Decimals, and &s;o when a minute is divided into 100 parts, there will be ten thou&s;and of them in a degree, and the &s;um of tho&s;e Secants divided by Radius, mu&s;t be again divided by ten thou&s;and, &s;o that the decrea&s;e, as I &s;aid before, will be in the re|mote, and in a manner u&s;ele&s;s Decimal parts: for it is to be no|ted, that a Table added up from whole minutes of Secants, as was Mr. <HI>Wrights,</HI> makes the Meridional parts &s;omewhat too great, as him&s;elf grants.</P>
<P>Now in regard the former way of making the Meridian-line, though true enough, may &s;eem to be tedious, as not to be perfor|med to 80 degrees, without 80 &s;everal additions of tho&s;e porti|ons or pieces by the Compa&s;&s;es, I thought fit to &s;upply 8 points on the Scale of equal parts in the Fronti&s;piece, which have onely pricks or full points &s;et to them, being indeed the Meridian-line for every 10^d from 0 to 80^d; and thus the Reader may &s;upply them, making 10^d of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er parts to be Radius, the di&s;tances of the&s;e Points from 10^d to 60, are the Secants of the middle La|titudes between them encrea&s;ed by 15&prime;.</P>

<P>The manner of forcing the Meridian-line was thus: Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI> Mathematical In&s;trument-maker, having one well made, and di|vided on the edge of a &s;quare rod, fitted to half an inch Radius, that is, every degree of Longitude was half an inch, and a larger then that he never made (a Chart made thereto from the Equi|noctial to 80 degrees of Latitude towards one of the Poles, will require five foot and above nine inches breadth.)</P>
<P>I de&s;ired him to pa&s;te white Paper over a large Table, and to divide the Degrees of a Quadrant thereon, drawing lines into the Center, which he accordingly did, and then moving the Me|ridian-line rod too and again till we found it would fit, it &s;eemed to both our judgements, that it might very well be divided from the degrees of the &s;aid Quadrant, according to the Di&s;tances and Angles here &s;et down, if carefully performed; and though this be not Geometrical, yet it may very well &s;erve for Sea-mens u&s;e; and tho&s;e that may doubt of the truth hereof till they have tried, having one already made, may make another carefully after this manner upon Paper, and then folding the Paper backwards in the lines B, C, D, E, F, lay the folded edges to their graduated line, and finde a good agreement, if performed well.</P>
<P>The Meridian-line is of &s;uch general u&s;e in Navigation, that indeed without it, or a Table thereof, the true Rumbe between two places cannot be known, a good Reckoning cannot bee kept, and thereby as <HI>Maetius</HI> well ob&s;erves, the Navigator is in a capacity to &s;ail unto all the coa&s;ts or corners of the earth, where|fore
<PB N="51" REF="60"> that the Reader might be every way &s;upplyed therewith, we have not onely added in a Table thereof, made to every &s;econd Cente&s;m, but likewi&s;e a Print from a Bra&s;s Plate of a Meridian-line, made to half an inch Radius, &s;o that by doubling or folding that Print (which is made to lye without the Book) upon a Paper or Blank, the Reader may by his Pen ea&s;ily, without the u&s;e of Compa&s;&s;es, graduate the Meridian-line of a Chart for any Voy|age: And &s;uppo&s;ing that Seamen will not go to Sea without it, that it may not be cumber&s;ome, they may have it put upon the edges of a &s;quare rod of a foot length to put in their pockets, upon which the other Scales of the Plain Scale may be likewi&s;e gradua|ted; or if the Reader would graduate a Meridian-line of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize on his Chart, he may prepare him&s;elf a line of equal parts on the &s;loap edge of a thin Ruler, and laying it by the line in his Chart, on which he would graduate the Meridional Divi&s;ions, ea|&s;ily and conveniently perform it by his Pen, without Compa&s;&s;es, by help of the Meridional Table.</P>

<P>The Meridional parts may be pricked down at thrice, fir&s;t &s;et 10^d out of the Meridian-line B from AE in the following Scheme, both upwards and downwards, then take from the Meridian-line C to 13^d 20&prime;, and prick from 10 upwards to B in the former Triangle, al&s;o take from C in the Meridian Scheme to 16^d, and prick it beneath from 10 to S downwards, then rai&s;e S H perpen|dicular to S B, and make S H equal to 58^d 20&prime;, or 33 Cente&s;ms taken out of the line A H of the former Scheme, and draw B H, and it &s;hall be the Rumbe required from the <HI>Berbadoes</HI> to <HI>St. He|lens,</HI> to wit, the Angle B 63^d 3&prime; from the Meridian, if mea&s;ured by former directions, the &s;um of both Latitudes is 29^d 33 Cen|te&s;ms, which prick from the &s;ame equal parts from B to L, and draw L K parallel to S H, and the extent B K mea&s;ured on tho&s;e equal parts, is 64^d, 7 the di&s;tance required, which in leagues allowing 20 to a degree, is 1294 leagues; or without drawing

<P>Thus when places are in both Hemi&s;pheres, the &s;um of the Me|ridional parts in both Latitudes, is the Meridional Leg; but when in the &s;ame Hemi&s;phere, the difference of the Meridional parts is the Meridional Leg, and the difference of Longitude in both Ca|&s;es the other Leg.

<P N="2">2. Another Property of the Rumbe-line, is, that it leads nearer and nearer unto one of the Poles, but never falleth into it, and near the Pole it turneth often round the &s;ame, in many Spires and turnings.</P>
<P>If by any Rumbe (but not under the Meridian) it were &s;uppo|&s;ed po&s;&s;ible to &s;ayl directly under the Pole point, it would follow that the Meridian-line of <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> &s;hould be finite, and not infinite, and that one and the &s;ame line &s;hould cut infinite o|ther Lines as &s;uch, at equal Angles in a meer point, which is again&s;t the nature and definition of a line, and then &s;eeing that the Rumbe derives its definition from the Angle, it makes with the Meridian: the nature and u&s;e of a Meridia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> under the Pole cea&s;eth, and con|&s;equently the Rumbe cea&s;eth, for under the Poles no &s;tar or other immoveable point of the heavens, doth either ri&s;e or &s;et, in refer|ence whereto the word <HI>Meridian</HI> hath its original, being u&s;ed to &s;ignifie the Mid-day time, or high noon of the Sun, or Star, rela|ting to their proper Motion; moreover under the Pole point the &s;ides of the Rumbe-triangles in the Sphere cea&s;e, wherefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e the An|gles mu&s;t needs do &s;o too.</P>

<P>Now then for all u&s;es in Navigation, we &s;uppo&s;e the Segments of the Rumbe <HI>m k, k h,</HI> and the re&s;t, to be a right Line, and if we give the Rumbe, to wit, the Angle <HI>l k m,</HI> and the Side <HI>k l,</HI> we may by the Doctrine of Plain Triangles finde the Side <HI>k m,</HI> the di&s;tance by the common Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of the Rumbe from the Meridian: Is to the Radius</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Latitude: To the di&s;tance</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>And from hence we may ob&s;erve another property in the Rum|be, as namely, that the Segments or Pieces thereof contained be|tween two Parallels, having the like difference of Latitude, are al&s;o equal to each other, &s;o that the like di&s;tance being &s;ayled in the &s;ame Rumbe in &s;everal parts of the earth, &s;hall cau&s;e the like difference or alteration of Latitude in each of tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P><HI>For Example:</HI> If a Ship &s;ayl from the Latitude of 10^d North-Ea&s;t, till &s;he be in the Latitude of 30^d, and then &s;ayl from thence on the &s;ame Rumbe till &s;he be in the Latitude of 50^d, the latter di&s;tance &s;hall be equal to the former di&s;tance, and the like &s;hall

<P>Again, if in the former Triangle we &s;hould give the Rumbe, to wit, the Angle <HI>l k m,</HI> and the difference of Latitude <HI>l k,</HI> we might finde the Departure from the Maridian <HI>l m</HI> by this Pro|portion:</P>

<P><HI>So is the difference of Latitude,</HI> 1 minute, to wit, <HI>k l:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Departure from the Meridian</HI> l m &proportion;</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e the Unit in the third place doth neither multiply nor divide, it follows that if you divide the Tangent of the Rumbe by the Radius, the Quotient is the Departure from the Meridian, or without &s;uch divi&s;ion it may be expre&s;&s;ed like a Fraction, thus: <HI>Tang. Rumbe / R,</HI> which &s;ignifies that the Tangent of the Rumbe is to be divided by the Radius; and now having the Departure from the Meridian given in any Parallel, we may by another Proportion finde the difference of Longitude agree|able thereto, and if the &s;ame Departure be often &s;cattered among&s;t many Parallels, as we have before &s;uppo&s;ed, we may by compoun|ding that Proportion, finde the &s;um of all the differences of Lon|gitude proper to each Parallel, which is the whole difference of <FIGURE>

<P>Now &s;uch Proportion as one Circle hath to another &s;uch Proportion, have their Degrees, Semi-diameters, and Sines of like Arches one unto ano|ther.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="64">
<P>As in the former Scheme, A C is the Radius of the Equino|ctial, and E D is the Radius of a Parallel or le&s;&s;er Circle, who&s;e Latitude from the Equinoctial is A E, but E D is the Sine of the Ark E B, which is the complement of the Latitude A E.</P>
<P>It therefore holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of the Latitude: Is to the Radius</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Or rather with other tearmes in the &s;ame Proportion.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Secant of the Latitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is a Mile or any part thereof, or number of Miles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude an&s;wering thereto</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the two fir&s;t tearms of the Proportion vary not, it will hold after the manner of the Compound rule of three.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sum of the Secants of all the parallels or Latitude between any two places:</HI> (and we allow a parallel to pa&s;s through every minute or Cente&s;me of a degree)</P>
<P><HI>So is a Mile or any number or part thereof allotted to every Parallel:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the whole difference of Longitude, that is, to the Sum of all the differences of Longitude proper to each Parallel</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Now as we &s;hewed before, the Departure from the Meridian is equally &s;cattered or &s;hared, and allotted the like portion there|of to every parallel, wherefore in &s;tead of the third tearm above which is the di&s;tributed part, we may take in a tearm equivalent thereto that findes it <HI>Tang.

<P><HI>As the Square of the Radius:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Sum of the Secants of all the Parallels between both La|titudes</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Rumbe: To the difference of Longitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>And in &s;tead of the two fir&s;t tearms, we may &s;ay:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the &s;um of all the Secants between both La|titudes divided by the Radius:</HI> (which as I have &s;hewed is the very tearm given by the Meridional Table)</P>
<PB N="60" REF="65">
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Rumbe from the Meridian:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>The four tearms of this Proportion being all of a different kinde, may be &s;o inverted in their order, that any three of them being given, the fourth may be found, and &s;o if it were required to finde the Rumbe, the difference of Longitude and Latitude being given, it will hold backward:</P>
<P><HI>As the Meridional parts between both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the difference of Longitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Tangent of the Rumhe</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Wherefore if we make the Meridional parts one Leg of a right angled Triangle, and the difference of Longitude the other, the Meridional parts being a&s;&s;umed or made Radius, the difference of Longitude becomes the Tangent of the Rumbe, and con&s;equent|ly the Angle between the Meridian and Rumbe-Line, or Hipote|nu&s;al, mea&s;ureth the quantity of the Rumbe from the Meridian; and this is the very ca&s;e and thing done in <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> be|tween all places, wherefore the truth of that Chart is as much in every re&s;pect above all contradiction, as the be&s;t Calculation that is as every was publi&s;hed, and we may very well conclude with Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> page 119. that all or any parts of the world may be &s;et down therein according to their Longi|tudes, Latitudes, Cour&s;es and Di&s;tances, as truly and far more conveniently for the Mariners u&s;e, then upon the Globe it &s;elf, with the which el&s;ewhere he &s;aith it agrees without &s;en&s;ible error; And in the words of its renowned Author Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> we may &s;ay it agrees therewith without &s;en&s;ible or con&s;iderable error.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee what can be objected again&s;t it: Mr. <HI>Speidel</HI> in his Brief Treati&s;e of <HI>Sphaerical Triangles,</HI> page 48 &s;aith, <HI>That by Mercators Chart in the bearing of two places, there will appear a ma|nife&s;t error of whole degrees, being compared with the Globe.</HI></P>
<P>And I adde, if this were true, there would al&s;o ari&s;e a great error in the di&s;tance, &s;eeing we have nothing but his bare word for it, it is as ea&s;ily here denyed, as there affirmed, and it were to be wi&s;hed he had left us his minde concerning it; if by compa|ring with the Globe he means it &s;hould be the &s;ame with the angle of Po&s;ition, this we deny; for the Rumbe makes the &s;ame Angles with both the Meridians of the places between which it is extend|ed,
<PB N="61" REF="65"> whereas the Angle of Po&s;ition at one of the places differs from what it is at the other place: And here note, that a Cour&s;e &s;ayled under the Meridian, or in a Parallel, is not properly called a Rumbe, for under the former the Ships motion de&s;cribes a great Circle, and in a parallel a le&s;&s;er Circle, whereas a Rumbe is no Circle at all, but rather re&s;embles a Spiral-line.</P>
<P>Another Objection may be rai&s;ed from learned Mr. <HI>Oughtreds Treati&s;e of Navigation,</HI> page 38. at the end of his Circles of Pro|portion, wherein he makes this one property of the Rumbe, that a Ship &s;ayling therein from one place to another, cannot return back to the fir&s;t place by the oppo&s;ite Rumbe: behold the former Scheme wherein in the Triangle <HI>k l m,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e a Ship to &s;ayl from <HI>k</HI> to <HI>m,</HI> then is <HI>l k m</HI> the Angle of the Rumbe fir&s;t kept, be|ing &s;ubtended by the Side <HI>l m;</HI> now if &s;he would &s;ayl back again from <HI>m</HI> to <HI>k,</HI> the Angle of the Rumbe will be <HI>n m k,</HI> a bigger An|gle then the former, becau&s;e the Side <HI>k n</HI> that &s;ubtends it, is a big|ger Side, and &s;o that if the Ship &s;hould &s;ayl back by the very op|po&s;ite Angle, the Ship would not arrive at <HI>k,</HI> but fall wide of it nearer unto <HI>n.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That this is true in nicety of &s;peculation, for in the right angled Triangle <HI>k l m,</HI> if I give the Side <HI>k l</HI> the difference of Latitude, and the Side <HI>l m</HI> the difference of Lon|gitude, reduced to the mea&s;ure of that Parallel, I may by the&s;e finde the Di&s;tance <HI>k m,</HI> and the Angle of the Rumbe <HI>l k m.</HI> In like manner in the Triangle <HI>m n k,</HI> the Side <HI>m n</HI> is equal to <HI>l k,</HI> but the Side <HI>k n</HI> is greater then <HI>l m,</HI> and is the difference of Lon|gitude in the given Parallel, whereby we may finde <HI>m k</HI> greater then it was found before, and the Angle of the Rumbe <HI>n m k</HI> grea|ter then the Angle <HI>l k m;</HI> And &s;o in the whole number of Rum|be-Triangles in finding the Rumbe, get the Meridional parts be|tween both Latitudes, by &s;ub&s;tracting the le&s;s from the greater, and thereby finde the Rumbe, this findes the le&s;&s;er Angle, and includes the mo&s;t Northwardly, and excludes the mo&s;t Southward|ly Parallel.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ub&s;tract a Cente&s;m or Minute from each Latitude, and then finde the Meridional parts, whereby calculate the Rumbe: this findes the bigger Angle, and excludes the mo&s;t Northwardly, and includes the mo&s;t Southwardly Parallel; and thus we may
<PB N="62" REF="66"> finde how much the inward Angle of the Rumbe differs from the outward, between both which the true Rumbe is a mean; but if the ca&s;e be put in different Hemi&s;pheres, the &s;um of the Meridio|nal parts in both Latitudes will finde the le&s;&s;er Angle, then &s;ub|&s;tract a minute from the greater, and adde a minute to the le&s;&s;er Latitude, and with the &s;um of the Meridional parts proper to both Latitudes thus altered, you may al&s;o finde the greater Angle.</P>
<P>The Meridional parts thus found, either way will be &s;o incon|&s;iderably different, that there will &s;carce be any &s;en&s;ible differ|ence between the Rumbe found by each operation, and therefore though the Objection be true in &s;peculation, yet cannot be &s;en&s;i|ble in practice, and what difference may thus ari&s;e, may be remo|ved to all po&s;&s;ible nearne&s;s, if in &s;tead of making a Rumbe trian|gle to every minute, we &s;hould divide a Minute or Cente&s;m into a hundred, a thou&s;and, ten thou&s;and, or a million of Triangles, and adde up the Secants of them according to Mr. <HI>Oughtreds</HI> opi|nion; but we may &s;ay with Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> page 114. that this were a matter more curious then nece&s;&s;ary, a Table made to every Mi|nute or Cente&s;m being &s;o near the truth, that it is not po&s;&s;ible by any Rules or In&s;truments of Navigation to di&s;cover any &s;en&s;ible error in the Sea Chart, &s;o far forth as it &s;hall be made according thereto: Secondly, were the Objection more con&s;iderable then it is, yet to me it &s;eems a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity in practice, to affirm that a Ship cannot return by the oppo&s;ite Rumbe.</P>
<P>Admit a Ship &s;ayl 1000 leagues up a River all the way North-Ea&s;t, he were no le&s;s then frantick that &s;hould deny that &s;he could return down the &s;ame River back again, and then by &s;uppo&s;ition the Compa&s;s did truly point all the way up North-Ea&s;t, how can it be conceived that the other end of the Rumbe-line on the Com|pa&s;s, if we make it a &s;treight line &s;o as to agree with the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;ts of the Horizon, did point at the &s;ame time other ways then South-We&s;t? or can it be apprehended that the meer winding or tacking about of the Ship to return, &s;hould all the way back cau&s;e the Compa&s;s to point otherwi&s;e then it did all the way up? and notwith&s;tanding the Objection, Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> grants, and pleads as much for the truth of <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> as he doth for the truth of the Calculation delivered by him&s;elf and others.

<P>Herein al&s;o we &s;hall for&s;ake the common Road, and make no u&s;e of the Meridian-line at all, which as it is not u&s;ed to this pur|po&s;e in Calculation, &s;o neither need it in any operation upon the Chart, on which we &s;hall ob&s;erve tho&s;e Proportions that are u&s;ed in Calculation, which are but two.</P>

<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of the Rumbe: Is to the difference of Latitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Di&s;tance</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the points R &amp; Q in the Chart were two I&s;lands, where|of I would mea&s;ure the di&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e places to be truly placed in the Chart according to their Latitudes and Longitudes, it is nece&s;&s;ary to find in what Latitudes both places are: thus, if you take the neare&s;t di&s;tance from Q to &s;ome Parallel, to wit, K L, and place it in the Meridian-line T S, the right way from that Pa|rallel you will find that place to be in the latitude of 22^d 5 tenths, and the point R will be found to be in the latitude of 24^d 42 cen|te&s;ms, get the difference of Latitude, which is one degree and 92 Cente&s;ms, which take out of the Scale of Inches, to wit, one inch,
<PB N="66" REF="68"> and 92 hundred parts of another, and lay a Ruler over the two places R Q, and it will cro&s;s the Parallels at the Points K and X, then enter the former extent &s;o by the edge of the Ruler, that one foot re&s;ting by it, the other turned about may but ju&s;t touch &s;ome one of the Parallels in the Chart; thus one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es will re&s;t at Y, and the other being turned about will ju&s;t touch K L, then is the extent K Y the di&s;tance in degrees, if mea&s;u|red in the Scale of Inches, to wit, 2^d 31 Cente&s;ms; and if you mea&s;ure the &s;aid extent in the line T W, it gives you the di&s;tance in leagues, to wit, 46 leagues and a quarter.</P>
<P>And if you have the Scale of leagues graduated on the &s;loap edge of your Ruler, you may &s;ee the di&s;tance without mea&s;uring any extent; and if the Line of Inches were wanting, you might double the difference of Latitude, and take it out of the Scale T W, and finde the di&s;tance the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In like manner, if the former extent were &s;o entred, that one foot turned about &s;hould ju&s;t touch <HI>r</HI> X, the Compa&s;&s;es would re&s;t at Z, and the extent Z X would be the &s;ame di&s;tance as before.</P>
<P>We would have mea&s;ured the whole Di&s;tance between <HI>Tenariff</HI> at T, and <HI>Nicholas I&s;land</HI> at N, but that we are confined to a nar|row room, and therefore will onely mea&s;ure one tenth part there|of: The whole difference of Latitude is 11^d, whereof a tenth part is one degree and a tenth, take one inch and a tenth out of the Scale of Inches, and entring it &s;o that one foot re&s;ting by the edge of the Ruler T N, the other turned about may ju&s;t touch T W, the re&s;ting foot will happen at P, and the extent T P mea|&s;ured on the Scale T W, is 26 leagues and a half, wherefore the whole di&s;tance is ten times as much, namely, 265 leagues.</P>

<PB N="67" REF="68"> in the &s;ame mea&s;ure wherein the difference of Latitude was ta|ken, and &s;o the Proportion before delivered is ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e</HI> 2. The &s;econd Ca&s;e is when two places are both in the &s;ame Latitude, and differ onely in Longitude, the Propor|tion holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Co&s;ine of the Latitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Longitude: To the Di&s;tance</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>I &s;aid before that we might very well &s;pare the Points of the Compa&s;s and Rumbes, wherewith mo&s;t Chards are filled, and that the Limbe of a Quadrant in &s;ome &s;pare place of the Chard would be of good u&s;e, in particular for the re&s;olving of this Pro|po&s;ition, yet the defect thereof we thus &s;upply.</P>
<P>Prick down 60^d of the Chords from T to H, which Point may be alwayes in a readine&s;s, and now let it be required to mea&s;ure the di&s;tance <HI>r</HI> X in the Latitude of 20^d, the Complement whereof is 70^d, with the Chord of 70^d draw an Arch at <HI>g,</HI> and &s;etting one foot in T, with the Radius T H cro&s;s the former Ark at <HI>g,</HI> over which and the point T, lay the edge of a Ruler, then take the ex|tent <HI>r</HI> X, and place it from T towards W, it reaches to G, the neare&s;t di&s;tance from G to the edge of the Ruler, is the di&s;tance &s;ought, if mea&s;ured in the line T W, to wit, 3^d 45 Cente&s;ms, where turning it twice over (making every degree to be ten leagues) I &s;hall finde it to be 69 leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Otherwi&s;e:</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e G to be a place in the Latitude of 28^d, and it were re|quired to mea&s;ure the di&s;tance thereof from T, with the Sine of 28^d upon <HI>o</HI> as a Center, de&s;cribe the Ark <HI>q,</HI> and lay the edge of the Ruler &s;o as it may lye over the outward edge of that Ark and T, then take the neare&s;t di&s;tance from G to the edge of the Ruler, which being turned twice over in the line T W, you will finde the di&s;tance &s;ought to be 65 leagues.</P>
<P>Now we may apprehend how to lay the Ruler without drawing the Ark <HI>q,</HI> &s;o as the Compa&s;&s;es turned about may ju&s;t touch the edge thereof, and then &s;etting down one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es by the &s;aid edge, turn the Ruler about that the edge may be to|wards G, and take the neare&s;t di&s;tance as afore&s;aid to it, and in Latitudes above 40^d or 45^d, the trouble of turning about the Ruler
<PB N="68" REF="69"> may be be&s;t &s;pared in that Ca&s;e, with the Sine of the Latitudes Complement, &s;etting one foot at H, lay the ruler over T, &s;o that the other foot turned about may touch the thin &s;loap edge thereof, and then take the neare&s;t di&s;tance thereto, as before.</P>
<P>For places that differ both in Longitude and Latitude, if they bear one from another Ea&s;t or We&s;t within a quarter or half a point, it may be truly alledged, that the way of mea&s;uring delive|red in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e will be very uncertain, becau&s;e the Compa&s;|&s;es will run along almo&s;t in a Parallel to the edge of the ruler, and &s;o cut it very obliquely.</P>
<P>As in Page 6 of the fir&s;t Part, <HI>Prop.</HI> 5. where C I may rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ent a We&s;twardly Cour&s;e and Di&s;tance, and C A the difference of Latitude, then doth the Perpendicular A I cut the line C I in the Point I very obliquely, and with uncertainty; for the finding of which with more certainty, the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tent C A was tripled to F, and the extent D B was tripled to G, as was declared in that Scheme.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, The di&s;tance may be al&s;o found as here in the &s;econd Ca&s;e, by the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude between both places.</P>
<P>And thus if it were required to finde the di&s;tance between the points <HI>d</HI> and <HI>f</HI> in the former Chart, by this rule it would be found to be 2^d 98 Cente&s;ms, which turned twice over in the Scale T W, is 59 leagues 7 tenths, which is not the true di&s;tance, becau&s;e the Rumbe between the&s;e places is above a Point from the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, whereas the true di&s;tance is 60 leagues 9 tenths; and in this Example the difference of Latitude is 63 Cente&s;ms, and though it were four degrees or more, we might fir&s;t finde the di|&s;tance by the Co&s;ine of the middle Latitude, and then enlarge it by entring it &s;o by the edge of the ruler laid over the two places, that one foot re&s;ting by the &s;loap edge, the other turned about might but ju&s;t touch &s;ome Meridian, in &s;tead of a Parallel in the former way.</P>
<P>Thus a ruler laid over <HI>d</HI> and <HI>f</HI> cuts the Meridian-line at <HI>u,</HI> and the former extent &s;o entred, one foot of it will re&s;t at <HI>m,</HI> while the other turned about will but ju&s;t touch T S, then the extent <HI>m u</HI> turned twice over and mea&s;ured in the line T W, will be 60 leagues 9 tenths the Di&s;tance required, the enlargement thus found being but very &s;mall as to matter of extent.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="69">
<P>Now we may take a view of what Rules have been formerly delivered for the Mea&s;uring of Di&s;tances, here we need not recite Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> way, which is not onely trouble&s;om, as not to be per|formed without two Pair of Compa&s;&s;es, but al&s;o uncertain, if the Di&s;tance be great.</P>
<P>The Way in u&s;e among&s;t Seamen is to take half of the whole extent between any two places in the Chart, and either to &s;et one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es down in the Meridian-line, at the middle Arch, which is the middle Latitude between both places, or at the middle &s;pace or ju&s;t half between the Latitudes of both places, which always falls &s;omewhat nearer the Pole then the middle La|titude, and then turn the other foot of the Compa&s;&s;es both up|wards and downwards, and minde what Arks it cro&s;&s;eth in the Meridian-line, then they count the whole Arch contained be|tween the places where the moveable foot &s;o cro&s;&s;ed, and take that for the whole di&s;tance &s;ought.</P>

<P>Difference of Longitude is 180^d, the extent in the Chart be|tween two places &s;o &s;cituated, is 182^d 42, the half whereof is 91^d 21, which mea&s;ured in the Meridian-line from the middle Lati|tude or Arch, which is 1^d 33, being half the difference of both La|titudes, and counted towards the greater Latitude, reacheth Northward to 66^d 15 one way, and Southward to 67^d 32 the other way, and &s;o by this reckoning the di&s;tance between the&s;e places &s;hould be 133^d, 47 by the middle Latitude, and 133^d, 98 by the middle &s;pace, whereas in truth by Calculation the di&s;tance in the Rumbe is much more, to wit, 180^d, 54.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing two places to be in the &s;ame Latitude, and to have but 58^d, 33 Cente&s;ms difference of Longitude, the example will be the &s;ame with one of tho&s;e before put between the <HI>Berba|does</HI> and <HI>St. Helens,</HI> and the di&s;tance found by the middle Arch or Latitude, is 62^d, 00, and the &s;ame by the middle &s;pace 61^d 38 cen|te&s;ms, but &s;hould be in truth 64^d, 7.</P>

<P>Where places are in the &s;ame Latitude or Parallel, the Com|pa&s;&s;es mu&s;t be &s;et down in the Meridian-line at the Latitude gi|ven, and the half extent applyed both upwards and downwards, as before; and if the di&s;tance be large, the mea&s;ure thereof will be much more erronious then when the Rumbe lyes nearer the Meridian.</P>

<HEAD>OF Sayling by the Arch of a GREAT CIRCLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE foundation of this kinde of &s;ayling &s;uppo&s;eth a great Cir|cle, who&s;e Center is the &s;ame with the Center of the Sphere, to pa&s;s through any two places propounded, the Arch of which great Circle on the Surface of the Sphere, is always &s;omewhat le&s;s then the di&s;tance between the two places in the direct Rumbe that leads from the one to the other: Moreover, this great Arch makes &s;everal and different Angles with every Meridian, whereas the Rumbe always maketh the &s;ame Angle. Now the chief benefit of this kinde of &s;ayling, is, that in an Ea&s;twardly or We&s;twardly Cour&s;e we may often &s;hift the Latitude with good advantage, both in re&s;pect of time and way, and thereby be the better enabled to correct the Dead Reckoning: Now as he that on a Globe or a true Projection of the Sphere, would draw a line re&s;embling the Rumb that pa&s;&s;eth between any two places, mu&s;t finde the Longitudes and Latitudes of many points through which it pa&s;&s;eth, and then by the be&s;t diligence he can draw a bending line through all tho&s;e Points, &s;o al&s;o they that would draw a line in <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> re|&s;embling the great Arch which pa&s;&s;eth between any two places, mu&s;t finde the Longitudes and Latitudes of many Points through which it pa&s;&s;eth, and then through all tho&s;e Points in the Chart draw a curved line, which &s;hall repre&s;ent the great Arch, and being drawn, are to &s;ayl as near it as they can, finding the re&s;pective

<P>Thus we &s;ee this Projection will &s;upply all the Ca&s;es that can be put, and is in effect no other then a Scheme for the carrying on of Proportions, and the Sphere; being thus reduced into right lines, we may thence rai&s;e Proportions for Calculating all that is requi|red. In the oblique-angled plain Triangle T P L, we have the two Sides T P and P L given, being the Tangents of the complements of both Latitudes, and the Angle comprehended T P L given, now we finde the other Angles at T and L by this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the &s;um of the two Sides: Is to their difference</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the half &s;um of the oppo&s;ite Angles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of half their difference</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>which Proportion is demon&s;trated in many Books of <HI>Trigonome|trie;</HI> And &s;o the two Sides of this Triangle are the Tangents of the Complements of the Latitudes.</P>
<P><HI>But as the &s;um of the Tangent of any two Arkes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the difference of tho&s;e Tangents</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the &s;ine of the &s;um of tho&s;e Arkes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the &s;ine of the difference of tho&s;e Arkes:</HI></P>
<P>See this demon&s;trated in Mr. <HI>Newtons Trigonometria Brittanica.</HI></P>
<P>Again the third tearm being the Tangent of the half &s;um of the oppo&s;ite Angles, in other Language is the Cotangent of half the contained Angle.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the half &s;um of the unknown Angles being added to their half difference, the &s;um makes the greater, and the difference the le&s;&s;er of tho&s;e unknown Angles. In like manner if the &s;aid half difference be added to half the contained Angle, the &s;um is the greater of tho&s;e Angles next the Perpendicular, and the difference is the le&s;&s;er, and the&s;e Angles we call the <HI>Vertical Angle.</HI></P>
<PB N="89" REF="79">
<P>The Proportion for finding the Perpendicular, having the Hi|potenu&s;al or Colatitude, and the Vertical Angle given, is:</P>

<P><HI>So is the Cotangent of the Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Targent of the Perpendicular</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Then a&s;&s; gning the difference of Longitude from the Perpendi|cular, we nave before &s;et down the Proportion for finding the Arks Latitude, and both the&s;e Proportions may be brought into one, and &s;o the Method of Calculation ari&s;ing out of the&s;e Con|&s;iderations, &s;uns thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. For a Parallel or Ea&s;t and We&s;t Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of half the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Tangent of the common Latitude</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Co&s;ine of the Ark of Longitude from the Perpendicular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Arks Latitude an&s;wering thereto</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Again, in all other Ca&s;es for the Vertical Angles.</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of the &s;um of the Complements of both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Sine of their difference</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Complement of half the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of half the difference of the Vertical Angles</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>which Ark thus found.</P>
<P>Adde to half the difference of Longitude, the &s;um is the great|er Vertical Angle, which if it exceed the difference of Longitude, the Perpendicular falls without, and this Ark comprehends the whole Angle between the Perpendicular and both Colatitudes, the difference between the fourth Proportional Ark and half the diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ence of Longitude, is the Angle between the le&s;&s;er Colati|tude and the Perpendicular, being the le&s;&s;er Vertical Angle.</P>
<P>When one place is in South Latitude, and the other in North, the fir&s;t and &s;econd tearms of this general Proportion change pla|ces, and the Sine of the &s;um becomes the Sine of the difference, and this that, as will be found if you make one of the contain|ing Sides greater then a Quadrant, the Polar di&s;tance in &s;tead of the Colatitude, and then for the Sine of an Ark greater then a Quadrant, take the Sine of that Arks complement to a Semicir|cle, which may &s;ometimes happen when both places are in one He|mi&s;phere, if the &s;um of the Complements exceed 90 degrees.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="80">
<P>Secondly, the Latitudes of the great Ark are found by this Pro|portion, which is in a manner the &s;ame as for a Parallel Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>As the Co&s;ine of either of the Vertical Angles, but rather the le&s;&s;er:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the tangent of the latitude of that place to which it is adjacent</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Co&s;ine of the Ark of difference of Longitude from the Per|pendicular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Arks Latitude &s;ought</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Thus by this excellent Method of Calculation we di&s;patch that at two Operations, which Ma&s;ter <HI>Norwood</HI> and others do not attaine under &s;even or eight, which rendred the Sayling by the great Arch &s;o difficult and laborious, that none cared to practi&s;e it. And this latter Proportion having two fixed tearms in it, will be performed on a Serpentine-line, or Logarithmical Ruler, with|out altering the Index or Compa&s;&s;es, which Proportion being va|ried, is carried on in the former Scheme:</P>
<P><HI>As the Secant of either of the Vertical Angles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Cotangent of the Latitude ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">acent thereto</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Secant of the difference of Longitude from the Perpendi|cular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Cotangent of the Arks Latitude &s;ought</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>In the former Scheme making the Perpendicular P A Radius, P T becomes the Secant of the Vertical Angle T P A to that Radius, and is al&s;o by con&s;truction the Tangent of the Comple|ment of the Latitude next that Angle, to another Radius, then by rea&s;on of the Proportion of Equality, which we have formerly handled, the Secant of any other Angle from the Perpendicular to the former Radius, as is P <HI>e,</HI> &s;hall be al&s;o the Cotangent of the Arks Latitude to the latter Radius.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the former Scheme &s;hews us how to delineate Proportions in Sines and Tangents, by framing of right-lined oblique Trian|gles; for as the Sine of the Angle at L is to its oppo&s;ite Side T P a Tangent, &s;o is the Sine of the Angle at T to its oppo&s;ite Side P L another Tangent; and by the like rea&s;on Proportions in Sines a|lone, or in Equal parts and Sines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be carried on in the Angles and Sides of Plain Triangles.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ix parts of a right-angled Spherical Triangle, no more but four at a time can be laid down in right Lines and Angles.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Places otherwi&s;e laid down.</HEAD>
<P>THis way of laying down the great Arch by it greate&s;t obliqui|ty, is univer&s;al, and when the fir&s;t Projection is inconvenient in finding the Perpendicular, and thence the Obliquity, one of the Vertical Angles mu&s;t be found, which being drawn in the Qua|drant from the Center, where it meets with the parallel of Lati|tude, gives a point pa&s;&s;ing through which the great Arch is to be drawn upon the common Center Q: Now this Vertical Angle may be either found on the former Scheme, or in an oblique plain Triangle, one &s;ide whereof &s;ought &s;hall be the Tangent of the half difference of the Vertical Angles, or in a Circular Scheme, as &s;hall afterwards follow, by carrying on the Proportion before de|livered for Calculating the &s;ame either of the&s;e three ways; it would be too long to in&s;i&s;t upon all, and by varying the Propor|tion u&s;ed for finding the di&s;tance in the former Projection, it may al&s;o be found in this.</P>
<P>The former Scheme, albeit it may be demon&s;trated from Pro|jecting the Sphaere, yet it may be more ea&s;ily and &s;peedily done
<PB N="98" REF="84"> by &s;hewing that it carries on the Proportions in Sines and Tan|gents before delivered for Calculating the Latitudes of the Arch, we need onely give one in&s;tance for places in the &s;ame Latitude.</P>
<P>The Arch G E in the former Scheme, is one of the Vertical Angles, or half the difference of Longitude for two places in the Latitude of 50^d, who&s;e difference of Longitude is 70^d: the near|e&s;t di&s;tance from E to Q R, is the Co&s;ine of half the difference of Longitude, making Q G Radius, which by con&s;truction is made equal to the Tangent of 50^d, the common Latitude to another Radius, wherefore by rea&s;on of the Proportion of Equality, the Co&s;ine of any Ark from the Perpendicular to the former Radius, to wit, the neare&s;t di&s;tance from <HI>a</HI> to Q R, being the Co&s;ine of 5^d difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, is therefore equal to the Tangent of the Arks Latitude &s;ought, to the latter Radius, proper to the given difference of Longitude, wherefore the Proportion is duly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>When the Obliquity or greate&s;t Latitude is very great, it will be inconvenient to draw it the former way, this commonly hap|pens when places differ much in Latitude, but little in Longitude, however generally places may be laid down otherwi&s;e on the lat|ter Projection.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t if their difference of Longitude be le&s;s then 90 or 85 de|grees, they may be laid down without finding either of the Ver|tical Angles, by &s;uppo&s;ing this Plain to touch the Equinoctial for mo&s;t conveniency at the Meridian of the greate&s;t Latitude; and if they be in different Hemi&s;pheres, then may the Parallels be continued below AE Q.</P>
<P>But if their difference of Longitude be more then 90^d, they may after the &s;ame maner be laid down by the difference of their Vertical Angles, whether they be in the &s;ame or both Hemi|&s;pheres, as in the Projection fir&s;t handled, the Angle V P T be|ing the difference of the Vertical Angles, doth as well help us to draw the great Ark T V I, as if the Angle I P T were given, be|ing the difference of Longitude greater then a Quadrant.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI> Suppo&s;e I would finde the Latitudes of the great Arch between the <HI>Lizard</HI> in 50^d of Latitude, and the <HI>Bermudas</HI> in Latitude 32^d 25&prime;, being both in the North Hemi&s;phere, the difference of Longitude being 55^d.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="84">
<P>To lay down the&s;e places, draw the Parallel AE B pa&s;&s;ing tho|row the Tangent of 55 degrees, on which making the Secant of that Ark Radius, the Tangent of 32^d 25&prime; is to be pricked down, to take out that Tangent to the &s;aid Radius.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Note, That the line Q <HI>k</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through 55^d of the Quadrant, counted from C, being continued till it meet with the Radius C D continued, is the Secant of 55^d, and by Parallels drawn through the Tangents in the line Q C, will al&s;o be divided into a line of Tangents, wherefore through the Tangent of 32^d 25&prime;, draw a Parallel meeting with the Line or Secant of 55^d drawn through the Quadrant at <HI>k,</HI> then is the extent Q <HI>k</HI> the Tangent to that Radius, which prick from AE to B, and draw L B, and it repre|&s;ents the great Arch between the&s;e places, and the Latitudes thereof from the Equinoctial are mea&s;ured by the Parallel Me|ridians, which are of &s;everal Radiu&s;&s;es, being Parallels drawn through the Tangents of 10^d, 20^d, 30^d, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="100" REF="85">
<P>Now to finde the Latitudes of the Arch from the <HI>Lizard</HI> for every 10^d difference of Longitude.</P>

Now by help of this Scheme you may ea&s;ily de&s;cribe the great Arch in the former Quadrant, take the Extent B E from hence, being the Sine of the le&s;&s;er Vertical Angle, which belongs to the greater Latitude, and upon A in the &s;ame Quadrant de&s;cribe an Ark therewith at <HI>n,</HI> a ruler from the Center cuts the parallel of Latitude there at L, through which point the great Arch was drawn.</P>
<P>In the former Scheme, the Vertical Angles being the Angles at the Pole on each &s;ide the Perpendicular, are mea&s;ured from the Point B, and the Chords of tho&s;e Angles from the Point A, are the Co&s;ines of tho&s;e Angles; and &s;o the extent A L is the Co&s;ine of the le&s;&s;er Vertical Angle, which prick from A in the line A S, the point found we may call <HI>the Vertical point;</HI> then prick down the Sines of every fifth degree from 90, as of 85^d 80^d &amp;c, in the line I B, from I towards B, and laying a ruler over the Vertical Point, and all tho&s;e Sine Points divide the Diameter into as many points, then prick down the Sine of the Latitude, to wit, 50^d in the Semicircle A B, from A upwards towards B, and a ruler over the &s;aid Latitude point, and all the former points found in the Diameter, will cut the under Semicircle B A in as many points or Arkes more, which being counted or mea&s;ured from B downwards towards A, are the re&s;pective Latitudes of the great Arch &s;ought.</P>

<HEAD>Now for the Latitudes of the great Ark.</HEAD>

<P>This following Chart we have made as large as the page would admit, and having a Meridian-line fitted to the degrees of Lon|gitude in that Chart, by the edge thereof on the Perpendicular P R, you may prick down the Latitudes of the Arch before found, and 5 degrees difference of Longitude on each &s;ide of the Perpen|dicular at a time, and thereby graduate the re&s;pective Points or Cro&s;&s;es through which the curved prickt line is drawn.</P>

<P N="1">1. The readie&s;t way is to a&s;&s;ume the Proportion of the Diame|ter of a Circle to its Circumference to be known, and to be in the Proportion of 113 to 355 (of which &s;ee <HI>Maetius</HI> his <HI>Practical Geo|metry</HI>) which two Numbers are ea&s;ily remembred, being the three fir&s;t odde figures of the Digits, each of them twice wrote down and cut a&s;under in the middle.</P>

<P N="3">3. The Sine of one Minute or Cente&s;m doth &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly differ from the length of the Arch to which it belongs, that the length of the Arch of one Minute or Cente&s;m may be very well taken to be the Sine thereof, and in the large&s;t Tables that ever were publi&s;hed, differs nothing therefrom, wherefore a Minute being the 21600 part of the Circumference of a whole Circle, the like part of the number 6283185 being 290, is the Sine of 1 Minute.</P>
<P N="4">4. You may finde the Co&s;ine of one Minute by &s;ub&s;tracting the &s;quare of the Sine of one minute from the &s;quare of the Radius, the &s;quare root of the remainder is the Co&s;ine of one minute.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Sine and Co&s;ine of one Minute being thus given, all the re&s;t of the Sines in the Quadrant may be calculated by Mr. <HI>Daries</HI> excellent <HI>Sinical Proportion,</HI> which runs thus:</P>

<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the double of the Co&s;ine of one minute</HI> &proportion;</P>

<P>Note al&s;o, that having made the Sines of the five fir&s;t and la&s;t degrees, and their quarters, the intermediate Sines may well e|nough in a Table not very large be &s;upplied, by dividing the dif|ferences proportionally, e&s;pecially for the five fir&s;t degrees of the Quadrant, in which the differences do but very little differ from each other: If be&s;ides the Sines of the five fir&s;t and la&s;t degrees, and their Minutes or Cente&s;ms, there be moreover given in &s;tore the Sine of every tenth degree in the Quadrant, which may be found by the former Proportions (after the Sine of the fifth de|gree is found) the Sine of any other Arch what&s;oever without ma|king any more Sines in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive order, may by help of tho&s;e in &s;tore be readily calculated, by rea&s;on no Arch in the Quadrant can be given, but it will be within five degrees or le&s;s of &s;ome known Sine, the Arch of that Sine we mu&s;t make the middle
<PB N="114" REF="93"> Arch, and the Sine and Co&s;ine of the Arch of difference between the middle Arch, and the given Arch, is by &s;uppo&s;ition already in &s;tore, and it will hold:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Co&s;ine of the Arch of Difference</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the mean or middle Arch: To the half &s;um of the Sines of the extream Arches on each &s;ide of it alike remote, where|of the given Arch is one</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>Again, <HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sine of the Ark of difference</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P><HI>So is the Co&s;ine of the middle Arch: To the half difference of the Sines of the &s;aid extream Arches</HI> &proportion;</P>
<P>The half &s;um of tho&s;e Sines added to their half difference, makes the Sine of the greater of tho&s;e extream Arches, and their difference makes the Sine of the le&s;&s;er of tho&s;e extream Arches, one of which is the Sine of the Arch &s;ought.</P>
<P>Admit in this latter Proportion it were required to produce the fourth tearm &s;o, as that it &s;hould be the whole difference of the Sines of the Extream Arches, then mu&s;t half the Radius be the fir&s;t tearm, being equal to the Sine of 30^d, which is the Co&s;ine of 60^d, and therefore if we make the middle Arch 60^d, by rea&s;on of the Proportion of equality in the two fir&s;t tearms, it follows that the Sine of the Ark of Di&s;tance of either of the extreams from 60^d, is equal to the difference of the Sines of tho&s;e extream Arches, and con&s;equently having all the Sines under 60^d made, all the re&s;t a|bove it are made by Addition onely: for in&s;tance, the Sine of 10^d is equal to the difference of the Sines of 50^d, and of 70^d, and therfore being added to the Sine of 50^d, &s;hal make the Sine of 70^d.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e in the former of tho&s;e Proportions, if you would have the la&s;t tearm to be the &s;um of the Sines of the Extreams, half the Radius mu&s;t be the fir&s;t tearm, and then making the mean or middle Arch to be 30^d, by rea&s;on of the Proportion of equali|ty between the Sine thereof and of half the Radius, it follows that the Co&s;ine of the Ark of Di&s;tance of either of the extreams from 30^d, is equal to the &s;um of the Sines of tho&s;e extream Arches, from which taking the le&s;&s;er of tho&s;e Sines, the remainder is the greater; hence it follows that if the Sines of the fir&s;t and la&s;t 30^d of the Quadrant be given, from them all the Sines between 30^d and 60^d may be made by &s;ub&s;traction. Let the three Arks be 20^D, 30^d, 40^d, the Sine of 80^d being the Co&s;ine of 10^d, the di&s;tance of the&s;e Arks from the middlemo&s;t, is al&s;o equal to the &s;um of the

<P>From the fir&s;t Sinical Proportion, making the Radius the Sine of the middlemo&s;t of three equi-different Arks, it follows:</P>
<P><HI>That as the Radius: Is to the &s;um of the Sines of the two arches next it on each &s;ide</HI> &proportion; Or rather by two other tearms in the &s;ame Pro|portion, <HI>As half the Radius: Is to the &s;ine of either of tho&s;e arks</HI> &proportion;</P>

<P>Wherefore the Rectangle of half the Radius, and of the &s;um of the Radius, and of the &s;ine of any other Arch, is equal to the &s;quare of the &s;ine of the middle Arch, from thence it followes, that the &s;ine of any Arch in the Quadrant being given, we may by this Rule, and extracting the &s;quare root, perpetually bi&s;ect or finde the &s;ine of the middle Arch between it and 90^d, and &s;o run up very &s;peedily towards the end of the Quadrant; of which &s;ine &s;o found, the Co&s;ine may be found by another extraction, and then you have the &s;ine of as &s;mall an Arch as you plea&s;e, near the beginning of the Quadrant, from which by Proportion, in regard the length of the &s;ine and of the Arch to which it doth belong, have no &s;en&s;ible difference, you may finde the &s;ine of one minute or Cente&s;me, and thence by the former Proportions rai&s;e a whole Table of Sines to as large a Radius as you plea&s;e, albeit the Proportion of the Diameter to the Circumference were wholly unknown, which not|with&s;tanding hereby might be found, for having made a &s;ine to a very &s;mall part of the Quadrant, the double thereof is the &s;ide of a Polygon in&s;cribed, and by Proportion:</P>

<P>Such Tables as have a degree divided into 100 parts or Cen|te&s;ms, are to be preferred before tho&s;e that divide the degree but into 60 Parts, Minutes or Sexage&s;ms, becau&s;e they are more exact in calculation, and more &s;peedy in finding the part proportional; and it were convenient for a Book of Tables to be &s;o contrived, that the Natural Tables of Sines, Tangents, and Ver&s;ed Sines to 90^d, might &s;tand again&s;t the Logarithmical Tables of Sines and Tangents in a portable Book, to be had by it &s;elf, to which might be added a Table of the Meridian-line to each, or every &s;econd Cente&s;m, with Tables of the Suns Declination, Right A&s;cen&s;ion, and of the Longitudes, Latitudes, Declinations, and Right A&s;cen|&s;ions of &s;ome of the principal fixed Stars, and of the Longitudes and Latitudes of places; but tho&s;e that have the Logarithmical Tables of Numbers, Sines and Tangents without the Natural, may &s;upply the want of them.</P>

<P>The ground of the former Proportion is, that the Logarithmical Tangents above 45^d, accounting every half degree for a whole one, are in the &s;ame Ratio or Proportion with a Table of the Me|ridian-line, whence al&s;o it follows for In&s;trumental u&s;e, that a Line of Logarithmical Tangents will &s;upply the defect of the Me|ridian-line.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SCALE U&s;ed in this Book.</HEAD>
<P>THough this Treati&s;e bears the name of <HI>the Mariners Plain Scale new Plain'd,</HI> yet the Scale intended thereby, is cut in the Frontis-piece of the fir&s;t Book.</P>
<P>Nothing more is nece&s;&s;arily required in the perfor|mances of this Book, then from the commonly known Divi&s;ion of a Circle into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, to prick down any number of Degrees le&s;s then 180^d, and a quadrant divided into nine equal parts, and one of tho&s;e parts for convenience below the Diamater into 10 Sub-divi&s;ions, called Degrees, may very well &s;erve the turn, which the Readers ingenuity will furni&s;h him&s;elf withal in any place, if he have but Compa&s;&s;es, yet for expedition a line of Sines is often made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>In the following Diagram, the equal Divi&s;ions of the Semicircle, are transferred into the line of Chords in the Diameter, by &s;etting one foot of the Compa&s;&s;es in A, which is called the le&s;&s;er Chord.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Chords being numbred by the half Arches, to which they belong, become a line of Sines of the &s;ame Radius with the Diameter of the Semicircle, and are called the greater Sines.</P>
<P>To that Radius there is fitted a Chord of 60 ^d, called the greater Chord, that the Reader might be &s;upplyed with both, for the le&s;&s;er Chord will not &s;erve to prick off an Arch in a Circle of twice the Radius whereto it is fitted, unle&s;s the &s;aid Chord be dou|bled in a right line before it be pircked into the Circumference.</P>
<P>The Sines to the Chord in the Diameter, are graduated on the Radius or line C B, by drawing lines thorough each degree of the quadrants AB, DB, and are called the le&s;&s;er Sines.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o added a Scale of equal parts and Rumbes for other Protractions, but we u&s;e neither of them in this Book.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="104">
<P>The Schemes in the Book are fitted either to the le&s;&s;er or greater Chord here de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Every degree of a Line of Sines, or Chords, we &s;uppo&s;e to be divided into 60 parts, which we call minutes, which in the following Operations are gue&s;&s;ed at, for a &s;mall In&s;trument will not admit of &s;o many Sub-divi&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Sphaerical Definitions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEfore we proceed to the Re&s;olution of any particular que&s;ti|ons, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e the common Spherical Definitions, and to &s;hew how the Analemma repe&s;ents them.</P>
<P>The word Sphere, though, as <HI>Herigonius</HI> &s;heweth, it be taken in a fourfold &s;en&s;e, yet I think it not nece&s;&s;ary to define above two of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Therefore a Sphere may, according to <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> be under|&s;tood to be a &s;olid Superficies, or round Body, contained under one Surface, in the middle whereof there is a point whence all right lines drawn unto the Circumference, are equal, and is made by the turning round of half a Circle, till it end where it began.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="104">2. It is taken for a certain round In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ting of divers Circles, whereby the motions of the Heavens, and the Scituation of the whole World, is mo&s;t conveniently repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>For the better explanation whereof, A&s;tronomers do imagine, 10 Principal points, and 10 Circles to be in the hollow in&s;ide of the fir&s;t moveable Sphere, which are commonly drawn upon any Globe or Sphere, be&s;ides divers other Circles which are not deli|neated, but onely apprehended in the fancy.</P>
<P>The Points are the two Poles of the World, the two Poles of the Zodiack, the two Equinoctial points, the two Sol&s;titial points, and the Zenith and Nadir.</P>
<P><HI>The Poles of the World</HI> are two points, which are Diametrically, or directly oppo&s;ite to one another, about which the whole frame of Heaven moveth from the Ea&s;t into the We&s;t, whereof one is perpetually &s;een by us, and is called the Arctick, or North Pole.</P>

<P>Then will the new Latitude be 52^d 27&prime;,</P>
<P>And the new Altitude 13^d 00.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, the Azimuth is the &s;ame as it is in the Latitude of 13^d when the Altitude is 52^d 27&prime;. Al&s;o the hour from noon in the new Latitude, is equal to the angle of Po&s;ition in the old Lati|tude,
<PB N="39" REF="122"> and the angle of Po&s;ition in the new Latitude, is equal to the hour from noon in the old Latitude.</P>
<P>The old or fir&s;t Scheme may very well &s;erve if you &s;et off 70^d the complement of the Declination each way from A, the end of the parallel of Altitude, and then through the point P, draw the parallel of Altitude parallel to the Horizon.</P>
<P>But here we have drawn a &s;econd Scheme, where N P is 52^d 27&prime;, P D and P E 70^d, thorough which points are drawn the pa|rallel D E; Al&s;o S B and N A is 13^d, thorough which is drawn the parallel B A, then is F &circdot; the Sine of the Suns Azimuth to the Northwards of the Ea&s;t, to the Radius F A which is placed from C to G, upon which with F &circdot;, was the Arch I de&s;cribed, and the Azimuth S L found to be 16^d as before.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> al&s;o in the fir&s;t Scheme (or in both) that the Radius C G might have been doubled, and pricked upon N S produced, then al&s;o mu&s;t the extent F &circdot; have been doubled, and the Arch I therewith de&s;cribed; al&s;o, the hour of the day might after the &s;ame manner be found in the parallel of Latitude which may be convenient for Stars that have much Declination in that Ca&s;e, the Declination and Latitude mu&s;t change Names.</P>

<P>The ground of the former Scheme, is, that the Sun in his pa|rallel of Altitude hath the like di&s;tance from the Zenith, as in his parallel of Declination, al&s;o his di&s;tance from the Center in his parallel of Altitude, is the &s;ame with his di&s;tance from the Cen|ter in his parallel of Declination, whence follows another Deli|neation of the Analemma &s;uitable to this ca&s;e, for we may place the parallel of Declination parallel to the Horizon, which now mu&s;t repre&s;ent the Equinoctial, then if the Sine of the Azimuth be prickt down in any given parallel of Altitude, the di&s;tance of that point from the Center and Zenith are both given, then ma|king the Sun to have the like di&s;tance in his parallel of Declina|tion from the Center, as he had in his parallel of Latitude: and moreover, if from the &s;aid point his di&s;tance from the Zenith in his parallel of Altitude be applied upward, it wil give the Latitude or Zenith &s;ought, from the Horizontal line repre&s;enting the Equi|noctial, and by the bare change of names, if the Sines of the re&s;pe|ctive Azimuths be prickt down in the parallel of Latitude, the re&s;pective Zeniths will become the Altitudes &s;ought. See page 38 to this purpo&s;e. And the &s;ame Zenith di&s;tance and Center di|&s;tance, is common to Azimuths as much remote on the other &s;ide the Vertical, wherefore the Scheme findes both.</P>

<P>Having de&s;cribed a Circle S Z N, and drawn the Horizon S C N, the Axis or Vertical Z C B, prick off the Poles height or latitude from N to P, and from P &s;et off 66^d 29&prime;, the Suns Polar di&s;tance being the complement of the Declination to D and E, and draw the Parallel D E. Prick down the Sine of the given Azimuth 30^d out of the Sines from C to G, and from G draw B G parallel to D E, and joyn S B produced or continued, then thorough the Point F, draw the Line H A parallel to S B, then is the arch S A 49^d 56&prime;, the Suns Altitude for the Azimuth of 60^d from the South, and the arch N H being 6^d 36&prime;, is the
<PB N="52" REF="129"> Suns height for the Azimuth of 60^d from the North. If H had fallen below N, then had the arch H N been the ark of the Suns depre&s;&s;ion under the Horizon, proper to the Azimuth given from the Ea&s;t or We&s;t northwards.</P>
<P>It had al&s;o been the Suns height for the like Declination to|wards the &s;outh Pole, proper to the like Azimuth counted from the Ea&s;t or We&s;t &s;outhwards, &s;o that there needs no Scheme for South Declinations.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> The excellency of this way further appears in this, that if the Azimuth we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e required, and the Latitude, Declination and Height given, the very contrary work would finde G C the Sine of the Azimuth to the common Radius.</P>
<P>The &s;ame manner of Operation al&s;o holds for the Sun or Stars when their Declination is more then the Latitude, in which ca&s;e the Parallel of Declination will not cro&s;s the line C Z within the Circle, but mu&s;t be produced to cut the line C Z continued without the Circle above Z, and then a line from the Inter&s;ection F happening without, being drawn parallel to S B, will pa&s;s through the quadrant Z N in two points, which &s;hall be the two Altitudes required, when it &s;o happens. And here note, that if C G had been pricked towards N, then B would have fallen as much above C, as it doth in the former Example below it, from which point B a line mu&s;t be drawn to N in &s;tead of S, which will be parallel to S B; and therefore a line drawn parallel thereto pa&s;&s;ing through F, &s;hall as well give the Altitudes required, as it did before; wherefore when the di&s;tance between A and F is but &s;mall, though the point F happen within, yet the operation will be mo&s;t certain to place C G on the other &s;ide the Vertical.</P>
<P>But here we mu&s;t prevent an inconvenience, for in &s;mall La|titudes when the Declination towards the elevated Pole is more then the Latitude, the parallel of Declination will not meet with the Vertical or Axis of the Horizon, but at a remote or inconve|nient di&s;tance. I &s;hall onely mention how this Inconvenience may be &s;hunned, omitting an Example thereof, in regard other ways before &s;poke to may prove more convenient.</P>

<HEAD>To Calculate the Latitude from the &s;aid Scheme.</HEAD>
<P>From the point I draw I L parallel to H F, and produce B F to L, then is I L equal to H F, the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes, and B L is equal to the Sum of B F and H I, and the angle B I L is equal to the Latitude of the place the fir&s;t work is to finde B F and H I in the Parallels of Altitude: The Proportion will be,</P>

<P>When the Azimuths are on different &s;ides the Vertical, take the Sum, when on the &s;ame &s;ide the difference between the fourth tearms found by each Operation, then it holds:</P>

<P><HI>Is to the afore&s;aid Sum or difference:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius to the Tangent of the Latitude.</HI></P>
<P>The two fir&s;t tearms of this latter Proportion in this Scheme, are as I L to L B.</P>
<P>Or it may be expre&s;&s;ed in two Proportions, thus:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Co&s;ine of the greater Altitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the Azimuth (from the Ea&s;t) thereto belonging, to a fourth number.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Is to the Co&s;ine of the le&s;&s;er Altitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the Azimuth thereto belonging, to a &s;eventh number.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of the fourth and &s;eventh Numbers, when the Azi|muths fall on different &s;ides the Vertical; but their difference
<PB N="67" REF="136"> when they happen on the &s;ame &s;ide, is equal to the Tangent of the Latitude.</P>
<P>Or it may be thus delivered:</P>
<P>Multiply the Co&s;ine of each Altitude by the Sine of the Azi|muth thereto belonging, and there will ari&s;e two Products, the &s;um of the&s;e Products when the Azimuths happen on different &s;ides, but the difference of them when they happen on the &s;ame &s;ide the Vertical, divide by the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes, and the Quotient will be the Tangent of the Latitude &s;ought. This &s;uppo&s;eth the Operations to be per|formed by the natural Tables of Sines and Tangents.</P>
<P>Now having the Latitude, either of the Altitudes with the Azi|muth theteto belonging, we have two Sides and the Angle com|prehended given, to finde the third Side, whereby is found the Declination required.</P>

<HEAD>SPHERICAL TRIANGLES Solved by PROJECTION.</HEAD>
<P>A Sphaerical Triangle is &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cribed on the Surface or Convexity of the Sphaere.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of a Sphaerical Triangle, are the Arches of three great Circles of the Sphaere mutually inter&s;ecting each other.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are &s;aid to be great Circles which bi&s;ect or divide the Sphaere in halfs.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical Angle (being the arch of Inclination between two Circles of the Sphaere) is mea&s;ured by the arch of a great Circle de&s;cribed on the Angular point, as a Center between the &s;ides, being extended to Quadrants.</P>
<P>Every Sphaerical Triangle is compo&s;ed of three &s;ides, and three angles oppo&s;ed thereto, any three of which &s;ix parts being given, the re&s;t may be di&s;covered by Projection, and is the &s;ubject of the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pole of a Circle is a point in the Surface of the Sphaere, di&s;tant always 90^d from the Circumference of that Circle to which it belongs, from whence it follows that all right lines pro|duced to the Circumference of the &s;aid Circle, are equal.</P>
<P>Any two Lines &s;o drawn, contain an Angle between them, mea&s;ured by the Arch or Circumference to which they belong. By help of this Pole point, the &s;ides of Sphaerical Triangles in all the following Propo&s;itions are mea&s;ured.</P>
<P>A Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of the Sphaere, is the Repre&s;entation of the Cir|cles of the Sphaere on &s;ome Plain or Flat, as they appear to the eye, according to its &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituation.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="140"> &s;ame Conclu&s;ions are performed on a Flat, as upon the Sphaere or Globe it &s;elf.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical Triangle is either right angled, or oblique angled; a right angled Sphaerical Triangle hath one right angle at the lea&s;t, the mea&s;ure of a right Angle being always a quadrant or 90^d, the Sides about or including the right Angle, are called <HI>Sides</HI> or <HI>Legs;</HI> and the Side &s;ubtending the &s;ame, is called the <HI>Hipotenu&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>Becau&s;e the&s;e Triangles are more ea&s;ily re&s;olved then the ob|lique, we &s;hall fir&s;t handle the &s;ixteen Ca&s;es thereof, and then proceed to the twelve remaining Ca&s;es of oblique angled Sphae|rical Triangles.</P>

</FIGURE>Having upon P as a Center, with 60^d of the Chords, de&s;cri|bed a Circle, draw a Line in|to the Center as V P produced, to repre&s;ent the fir&s;t hour, and &s;et off 105 de|grees, the diffe|rence of time from V to K, and draw K P produced, then &s;et off a quadrant or 90^d, from V to Q, al&s;o from K to <HI>q,</HI> then prick off the Suns Declinati|on 23^d 31&prime; from V to D, al&s;o from K to <HI>d,</HI> and prick off the complement of the le&s;&s;er Altitude, to wit, 62^d 37&prime; from D to A and L, a ruler over Q and A, cuts P V at C; al&s;o a ruler over Q, and L, cuts the &s;aid Line produced at F, the half
<PB N="36" REF="157"> between F and C is at H, with the extent H C, upon H as a Cen|ter, de&s;cribe the ark C Z.</P>
<P>Again, prick off the complement of the le&s;&s;er Altitude, to wit, 36^d 15&prime; from <HI>d</HI> to <HI>a</HI> and <HI>l,</HI> a ruler over <HI>q</HI> and <HI>a,</HI> cuts K P at R, al&s;o a ruler over <HI>q</HI> and <HI>l,</HI> cuts P K produced at F, the half between F and R is at G, with the extent G R, upon G and a Center, de&s;cribe the ark R Z; where the&s;e arks inter&s;ect, as at Z, is the Zenith, draw the line S M pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;aid Inter&s;ection and the Center, and it &s;hall repre&s;ent the hour-line of 12, the arch S K &s;hews the hour to the greater Altitude to be 30^d from the Meridian, or 2 in the afternoon, and the arch S V &s;hews the hour proper to the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation to be 75^d, or 7 in the morning.</P>
<P>Set off a quadrant from S to E, a ruler over E and Z, cuts the primitive Circle at B, and the arch S B being 51^d 32&prime;, &s;hews the Latitude of the place to be 51^d 32&prime;.</P>
<P>When the Declination is South (being in our Northern Hemi|&s;phere) it mu&s;t be prickt below the Hour-lines V P and K P, whereas in this Example being North, it was pricked above them; Or if the Declinations, the Difference of right A&s;cen&s;ions (which is the difference of Time) and the Altitudes of two Stars were gi|ven at any time, though off the Meridian, the Latitude and true time might be found after the &s;ame manner; for tho&s;e Ca&s;es of Triangles (though the two Declinations are different) are the &s;ame with tho&s;e here re&s;olved, as I may have occa&s;ion el&s;ewhere to calculate, whereto this will be a good check; which Propo&s;i|tions may be of good u&s;e at Sea, for finding the Latitude by Ob|&s;ervations taken off the Meridian.</P>
