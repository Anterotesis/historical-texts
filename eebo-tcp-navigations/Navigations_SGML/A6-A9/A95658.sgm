<P>_THere was never age more guil|ty than this pre&s;ent, of the great expence, and wa&s;te of paper: who&s;e fair innocence hath been extreamly &s;tubber'd by Errors, Here&s;ies, Bla&s;phemies, and what not, in the&s;e bold times: which like &s;o many (the foule&s;t of all) blots, &amp; blurs, hath defiled very much of it, &s;o true is that of the Poet,</P>

<P>The &s;umme &amp; &s;ub&s;tance of what here follows (as a de&s;cription of that Empire) I long &s;ince compo&s;ed, &s;hortly after my re|turn from <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and then pre&s;ented it in writing unto the late King, when he was Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in the year 1622. with this &s;hort following Epi&s;tle.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Renowned Prince,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have nothing to plead for this high pre&s;umption, but the Novelty of my &s;ubject, in which I confe&s;&s;e &s;ome few have prevented me, who bv traveling <HI>India</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Europe,</HI> have writ|ten &s;omewhat of tho&s;e remote&s;t parts, but like unto poor Trade&s;men, who take up Wares on tru&s;t, have been deceived them&s;elves, and do deceive of others.</P>
<P>For my &s;elf I was an eye-witne&s;&s;e of much here related, living more than two years at the Court of that mighty Monarch the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> (who prides him&s;elf very much in his mo&s;t famous Ance&s;tor <HI>Tamberlane)</HI> in the de&s;cripti|on of who&s;e Empire, your Highne&s;&s;e may meet with large Territories, a nu|merous Court, mo&s;t populous, plea&s;ant, and rich Provinces, but when all the&s;e &s;hall be laid in the Balance again&s;t his mi&s;erable blindne&s;&s;e, your Highne&s;&s;e &s;hall have more cau&s;e to pity, than envy his greatne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="3" MS="y">
I am not ambitious to make this my Relation publick, and therefore if it con&s;ume more paper, it &s;hall not be my fault: As it is, in a fearfull boldne&s;&s;e 'tis offered to your Princely hands, and if it may be any way plea&s;ing and u&s;efull, I have my reward; if not, my mo&s;t hum|ble de&s;ires to have mini&s;tred &s;omething this way unto your Highne&s;&s;e, &s;hall be my comfort.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus <HI>(Reader)</HI> thou heare&s;t when this Relation was fir&s;t written, and into what hands it was then put: And although there be now a very great &s;pace of time 'twixt the particulars then ob&s;erved, and their publication now; which may make thee look upon that which is here brought forth <HI>as an untimely birth,</HI> or as a thing <HI>born out of due time.</HI> Therefore know (which may give thee &s;ome &s;atisfaction herein) that for the commodities, and di&s;commodities of tho&s;e remote parts; for the cu&s;tomes and manners of that people; for their Religion and policie, with every
<PB REF="4">
thing be&s;ide (wherein thou maye&s;t de&s;ire information) which lies within the va&s;t compa&s;&s;e of that huge Monarchy expre&s;|&s;ed in the Map, and further de&s;cribed in this following di&s;cour&s;e (time not making that people at all to varie from them|&s;elves) thou maye&s;t look upon it now, as if it hath been taken notice of, but imme|diately before it was here communicated; and if it prove u&s;efull now, I &s;hall be ve|ry glad that it was re&s;erved even for this pre&s;ent time, wherein it might do &s;ome good.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding this, it &s;hould ne|ver have been brought by me into this more open view, (e&s;pecially in &s;uch a &s;cribling writing age as this) <HI>where there is no end of making many books;</HI> (and many of tho&s;e written to no end, but what is evil and mi&s;chievous) but that the Printer, who had gotten my Ori|ginal Copie, pre&s;ented as before, de&s;ired to publi&s;h it. And becau&s;e &s;o, I have re|vi&s;ed, and in &s;ome particulars by perti|nent, though in &s;ome places very long di|gre&s;sions
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
(which I would intreat the Rea|der to improve) &s;o enlarged it; that it may, (if it reach my aim) contain matter for in&s;truction and u&s;e, as well as for re|lation and novelty. So that they, who fly from a Sermon, and will not touch &s;ound, and whole&s;om, and excellent treati&s;es in Divinity, may happily (if God &s;o plea&s;e) be taken before they are aware, and over|come by &s;ome Divine truths that lie &s;cattered up and down in manie pla|ces of this Narrative. To which end I have endeavoured &s;o to contrive it for every one (who &s;hall plea&s;e to read it through) that it may be like a well form'd picture, that &s;eems to look &s;tedfa&s;tly upon everie heholder, who &s;o looks upon it.</P>
<P>But here Reader, let us &s;it down and wonder that in the&s;e dayes (which are cal|led times of Reformation) manie choi&s;e books are often publi&s;hed, which contain in them&s;elves, and declare unto others very much of the minde of God: yet are laid a&s;ide, as if they were not worth the looking into, and in their &s;tead <HI>Roman|ces,</HI>
<PB REF="5">
and other Pamphlets, <HI>eju&s;dem fari|nae,</HI> of the like kinde, which do not in|form, but corrupt rather the mindes of tho&s;e, which look &s;o much into them, teaching wickedne&s;&s;e while they &s;eem to reprove it, are the books (O times!) which are generally call'd for, bought up, read, and liked.</P>
<P>When a Traveller &s;ometimes ob&s;erved the women in <HI>Rome</HI> to plea&s;e them&s;elves in, and overmuch to play with their Curs, and Monkeys; he asked whether or no the women of <HI>Rome</HI> did not bear Children to delight them&s;elves withall. The &s;torie is &s;o parallel to what I before ob&s;erved; that he who runs may make Application, and therefore I forbear to do it.</P>
<P>As for that I have here publi&s;hed I know,&mdash;<HI>habent &s;ua fata libelli,</HI> that books have their Fates, as well as their Authors; and therefore this Relation now it is got into the World, mu&s;t take its chance, what&s;oever its &s;ucce&s;&s;e, or acce|ptance be: But however I &s;hall never be of their minde, who think tho&s;e books be&s;t,
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
which be&s;t &s;ell, when certain it is that they are not to be valued by their good &s;ale, but good u&s;e.</P>
<P>Which while &s;ome may make of this; others who love to carp, and cen&s;ure, and quarrel (&s;o as <HI>to make a man an offen|der for a word)</HI> may put har&s;h interpre|tation upon &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages they may find in this following di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Mala mens, ma|lus animus,</HI> an evil minde in it &s;elf, is an evil minde to all others. 'Twas &s;aid of <HI>Diogenes</HI> that he was <HI>tuba convitio|rum;</HI> the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of <HI>reproaches;</HI> and that when he accu&s;ed <HI>Plato</HI> of pride, he beat it down with greater pride. The <HI>Gra|marians</HI> were laughed at for taking &s;o much pains to find out the faults of <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es,</HI> and would not take notice of any of their own. They are the wor&s;t of the Crea|tures that breed in, and delight to be ever &s;tirring up and down in corruption. But I would have all, who have an eye &s;tand|ing too far out of their heads, and are therefore apt to &s;ee more in others than them&s;elves, and con&s;equently may ob&s;erve
<PB REF="6">
more than is meant, from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of this book, to bound all their conceivings a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to what they may finde here within the compa&s;&s;e of it, by that rule, which holds good in charity and law, and is true in Di|vinity likewi&s;e, <HI>in dubiis benigniora,</HI> that when any thing delivered may bear two interpretations, to take the faire&s;t.</P>
<P>And now that this following relation may not appear to be a lo&s;&s;e, either of time or paper, he that &s;hall plea&s;e to read it, in our pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> may ob&s;erve very large foot-&s;teps of the Almighty in his works of Creation &amp; Providence. And when I have brought him thither on &s;hore he may finde that there is not one que|&s;tion (as before) of any con&s;equence con|cerning tho&s;e parts I have undertaken to write of, but it findes &s;atisfaction in one part or other of this di&s;cour&s;e. For the Court there, there is &s;o much riches and &s;plendour &s;ometimes to be &s;een in it, that it may draw up the meditations of tho&s;e which behold it, as the thoughts of <HI>Ful|gentius</HI> &s;ometimes were, (when he beheld
<PB REF="6" MS="y">
the glorie of the Court of <HI>Rome)</HI> rai&s;ed up &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the glorie of Heaven. And for the &s;oil it is exceeding plea&s;ant, rich, and good, as in &s;ome other parts of the world, where the inhabitants are meer &s;trangers to God; and if Al|mighty God hath given &s;uch &s;weet places of abode here on the earth to very many whom he owns not; how tran&s;cendently glorious is that place which he hath pre|pared for them that love him.</P>
<P>Yet for the Inhabitants there, a man may clearly &s;ee, the law of Nature to be &s;o ingraved upon the hearts of very many, both <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Mahometans:</HI> as that it may make multitudes, who pro|fe&s;&s;e them&s;elves Chri&s;tians (if they would but turn their eyes inward) extreamly to wonder, how it comes to be &s;o much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> out of theirs.</P>
<P>And then he may further behold, &s;uch <HI>Temperance, Ju&s;tice,</HI> unwearied <HI>devo|tion</HI> (but in a wrong way) with many o|ther excellent <HI>Moralitics</HI> &s;o to &s;hine its them; that by this very light, he may &s;ee
<PB REF="7">
thou&s;ands of tho&s;e (whom before I nam'd) that have means to know, and there|fore &s;hould do better, in many things to come exceeding &s;hort of them, who (them|&s;elves are ready to conclude) come &s;hort of Heaven.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not further anticipate my di&s;cour&s;e, in being like a vain-glorious entertainer, who fills the ears of his gue&s;ts with his di&s;hes, before they &s;ee, or ta&s;te them. Which if thou &s;hall plea&s;e to do, read on, and thou art very welcome how|ever.</P>

Fir&s;t for God, the great God of Heaven and Earth, whom generally all the people in the world, Heathen, as well as Chri&s;tians doe confe&s;s, they (as this <HI>Cooree</HI> told us) acknowledge none. For their &s;peech it &s;eemed to us inarticulate noy&s;e rather than Language, like the clucking of Hens, or gabling of Turkeys; and thus making a very &s;trange confu&s;ed noy&s;e, when they walk here or there: if there be two or three, or five, or ten, or twenty, or very many more in company, it is their manner to walk in rank one after the other, in &s;mall paths they have made by their thus walking, as Kine in Summer many times doe, when they come home to the Payl; or as wild|gee&s;e who fly in ranks, and as they fly make a noy&s;e; &s;o the&s;e walking together thus gabble from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t in company, as if all &s;pake, but none an&s;wered.

Their ornaments and Jew|els. Bullocks or &s;heeps-guts full of excrement, about their necks, and therefore when we bought their Cattell they would take (and we were content they &s;hould) their skins, guts, and gar|bage, which plentifully furni&s;hed them with that rich attire, and gay ornaments; and when they

were hungry, they would &s;it down upon &s;ome hillock, fir&s;t &s;haking out &s;ome of that filthy pud|ding out of the guts they wore about their necks, then bowing and bringing their mouths to their hands, almo&s;t as low as their knees, like hungry doggs would gnaw, and eat the raw guts, when you may conceive their mouths full of &s;weet green &s;awce. The women as the men are thus adorned, thus habited, and thus dieted only they wear more about their lower parts than the men. And (by the way) the&s;e carry their &s;uck|ing infants under their skins upon their backs, and their bre&s;ts hanging down like Bag-pipes, they put up with their hands to their children, that they may &s;uck them over their &s;houlders. Both &s;exes make coverings for their heads like to skull caps, with Cow-dung, and &s;uch like filth mingled with a little &s;tinking grea&s;e, with which they likewi&s;e be&s;mear their faces, which makes their company un&s;ufferable, if they get the wind of you. I ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the re&s;t of their dyet was agreeable to the former, for they would eat any refu&s;e thing, as rotten and mouldy Bi&s;|kets, which we have given them, fit indeed for nothing but to be ca&s;t away; yea, they will eat that which a ravenous dog in <HI>England</HI> will re|fu&s;e.

<P>At <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> this our Traveller had made upon the <HI>Wri&s;ts</HI> of his left <HI>Arm</HI> the Arms of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> a <HI>Cro&s;s Cro&s;&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>Cro&s;slets;</HI> and on the <HI>Wri&s;t</HI> of his <HI>right,</HI> a &s;ingle <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> made like that our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;uffered on; and on the &s;ides of the <HI>&s;tem</HI> or <HI>tree</HI> of that <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> the&s;e words written, <HI>Via, Veritas, Vita&punc;</HI> &s;ome of the letters being put on the one &s;ide of that &s;tem or tree, and &s;ome of them on the other; and at the foot of that <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> three <HI>Nails,</HI> to &s;ignifie tho&s;e which fa&s;tned our <HI>Saviour</HI> unto it: All the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions were made by &s;harp <HI>Needles</HI> bound together, that pierced onely the skin, and then a black Powder put into the Places &s;o pierced, which became pre&s;ently indelible <HI>Cha|racters,</HI> to continue with him &s;o long as his fle&s;h &s;hould be covered with <HI>skin:</HI> And they were done upon his Arms &s;o artificially, as if they had

<P>Now after that him&s;elf and Camrade had &s;een what they de&s;ired in and about <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> they took their leave of tho&s;e <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> lea|ving with them money to recompence the cur|te&s;y they had received from them; the <HI>Friars</HI> being very poor, and con&s;equently unable to en|tertain them freely without requitals.</P>
<P>From hence they took their way to take a view of the <HI>Dead Sea</HI> (&s;o called, either becau&s;e the water therein is &s;till, and moves not, or be|cau&s;e no living Creature is in it, and nothing thrives on the banks thereof) the place where <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and <HI>Admah</HI> and <HI>Ze|boim</HI> once &s;tood, tho&s;e Cities <HI>which Almighty God overthrew in anger, and repented not,</HI> Jer. 20. 16.

<P>From <HI>Sidon</HI> they got a pa&s;&s;age by Sea unto <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> now called <HI>Scanderoon</HI> (in the extreme&s;t bottom of the <HI>Mediterranean Sea)</HI> which is one of the unwhol&s;ome&s;t places in the World; where I have often heard that no

At this place his Engli&s;h Com|panion left him, and turned his face towards <HI>England,</HI> and he pre&s;ently took his way towards <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> about &s;eventy miles or more di&s;tant from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> which is as much re|nowned for whol&s;omne&s;s, as the place before|named for being unwhol&s;ome; and therfore it is called, <HI>&s;weet-air'd Aleppo.</HI> Here he being kindly received by the <HI>Engli&s;h Con&s;ul,</HI> &s;tayed a time to gain the company of a <HI>Carava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of a great mixt multitude of people from divers parts, which get and keep together travelling tho&s;e parts, for fear of the incur&s;ions and vio|lences by <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Murtherers,</HI> which they would undoubtedly meet withall, if they tra|velled &s;ingle, or but few together. With the&s;e he after &s;et forwards towards, and to that City antiently called <HI>Nineveh</HI> in <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> which we find in the Prophe&s;ie of <HI>Jonah</HI> was &s;ometimes <HI>a great and excellent City of three daies journey,</HI> Jonah 3. 3. but now &s;o exceedingly le&s;&s;en'd and lodg'd in ob&s;curity, that pa&s;&s;engers cannot &s;ay of it, <HI>this was Nineveh,</HI> which now hath its old name changed, and is called <HI>Mozel.</HI> From hence they journied to <HI>Babylon</HI> in <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> &s;i|tuated upon the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> once likewi&s;e &s;o great that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> called it a <HI>Countrey,</HI> not

And from hence they went forward to|wards the Kingdome of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and there to <HI>Uz&s;pahan,</HI> the u&s;ual place of re&s;idence for that great King, then called <HI>Sha Abbas,</HI> or <HI>King Abbas.</HI> And after they went to <HI>Seras,</HI> an|tiently called <HI>Shu&s;han,</HI> where the <HI>great King Aha&s;uerus</HI> kept his Royal and mo&s;t Magnifi|cent Court, <HI>E&s;t.</HI> 1 From hence they journied afterwards to <HI>Candahor,</HI> the fir&s;t Province North ea&s;t under the &s;ubjection of the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Lahore</HI> the chiefe&s;t City but one belonging to that great Empire; a place, as I have been often told by <HI>Tom: Coryat</HI> and others of very great <HI>trade, wealth</HI> and <HI>delight,</HI> lying more temperately out of the Parching Sun than any other of his great Cities do: And to this City he wanted not Company, nor afterwards to <HI>Agra,</HI> the <HI>Mogol's Metropolis</HI> or chief City.</P>
<P>And here it is very ob&s;ervable, that from <HI>La|hore</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> it is four hundred Engli&s;h miles, &amp; that the Countrey betwixt both the&s;e great Ci|ties is rich, even, plea&s;ant and flat, a <HI>Campania;</HI> and the rode-way on both &s;ides all this long di|&s;tance

<P>At <HI>Agra</HI> our Traveller made an halt, being there lovingly received in the <HI>Engli&s;h Factory,</HI> where he &s;taid till he had gotten to his <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, &s;ome good knowledge in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Indo&s;tan Tongues,</HI> in which &s;tudy he was alwaies very apt. and in little time &s;howed much proficiency.

<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> tongue, he made afterwards an <HI>Oration</HI> to the Great <HI>Mo|gol,</HI> bringing in that Story of the <HI>Queen of She|ba,</HI> 1 King. 10.

<P>After this he having got a great ma&s;tery like|wi&s;e in the <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> or more vulgar Language, there was a woman, a Landre&s;s, belonging to my Lord <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors hou&s;e,</HI> who had &s;uch a freedome and liberty of &s;peech, that &s;he would

<P>One long ago <HI>built</HI> a Temple to <HI>Diana</HI> in hope of <HI>Glory,</HI> intending it for one of the Great Wonders of the World; Another after in hope of <HI>Fame burnt</HI> it.

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Soyl there, what it is, and what it produceth, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis mo&s;t &s;pacious and fertile Monarchy (called by the Inhabitants <HI>Indo&s;tan)</HI> &s;o much abounds in all nece&s;&s;aries for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of man, to <HI>feed,</HI> and <HI>cloath,</HI> and <HI>enrich</HI> him, as that it is able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and flouri&s;h of it &s;elf, without the lea&s;t help from any Neighbour-Prince or Nation.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t of that which Nature requires mo&s;t, <HI>Food,</HI> which this Empire brings forth in abundance; as, &s;ingular good <HI>Wheat, Rice, Barley,</HI> with divers more kinds of good <HI>Grain</HI> to make Bread (the &s;taff of life) and all the&s;e &s;orts of Corn in their kinds, very good and exceeding cheap. For their <HI>Wheat,</HI> it is more <HI>full</HI> and more <HI>white</HI> than ours, of which the In|habitants make &s;uch pure, well-reli&s;hed Bread, that I may &s;ay of it, as one &s;ometimes &s;pake of the Bread made in the <HI>Bi&s;hoprick of Leige,</HI> it is <HI>Panis Pane melior,</HI> Bread better than Bread.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;ort of people eat Bread made of a coar&s;er Grain, but both <HI>tooth&s;ome,</HI> and <HI>whol|&s;ome,</HI> and <HI>hearty;</HI> they make it up in broad <HI>Cakes,</HI> thick like our <HI>Oaten-cakes;</HI> and then bake it upon &s;mall round iron <HI>hearths,</HI> which
<PB N="93" REF="62">
they carry with them when they journey from place to place, making u&s;e of them in their <HI>Tents.</HI> It &s;hould &s;eem to be an antient Cu|&s;tome in the Ea&s;t, as may appear by that pre|&s;ident of <HI>Sarah</HI> when &s;he entertained the Angels, who found her in her Tent; <HI>She took fine meal, and did knead it, and made Cakes thereof upon the hearth,</HI> Gen. 18. 6.</P>
<P>To their Bread they have great abundance of all other good Provi&s;ion, as of <HI>Butter</HI> (beat|ing their Cream into a &s;ub&s;tance like unto a thick Oyl, for in that hot <HI>Climate</HI> they can ne|ver make it hard) which though &s;oft, yet it is very &s;weet and good. They have <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> like|wi&s;e in plenty, by rea&s;on of their great number of <HI>Kine,</HI> and <HI>Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Goats.</HI> Be&s;ides, they have a Bea&s;t very large, having a &s;mooth thick skin without hair, called a <HI>Buffelo,</HI> which gives good milk; the fle&s;h of them is like <HI>Beef,</HI> but neither &s;o tooth&s;ome nor whol&s;ome. The&s;e <HI>Buffeloes</HI> are much employed in carrying large skins of water (for they are very &s;trong Bea&s;ts) which hang on both &s;ides of them, unto Families that want it: their <HI>Hides</HI> make the mo&s;t firm and excellent <HI>Buff.</HI></P>
<P>They have no want of <HI>Veni&s;on</HI> of divers kinds, as <HI>Red-Deer, Fallow-Deer, Elks</HI> (which are very large, and &s;trong, and fierce Creatures) <HI>Antilops, Kids, &amp;c.</HI> but their <HI>Deer</HI> are no where imparked, the whole Empire being (as
<PB N="94" REF="63">
it were) a Forre&s;t for them; for a man can travel no way but he &s;hall here and there &s;ee of them. But becau&s;e they are every mans Game that will make them &s;o, they do not multiply to do them much hurt, either in their <HI>Corn,</HI> or other <HI>places.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e, they have great &s;tore of <HI>Hares,</HI> and they have plenty of <HI>Fowls wild</HI> and <HI>tame,</HI> as abundance of <HI>Hens, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Partriches, Peacocks, Quails,</HI> and many other &s;ingular good <HI>Fowl.</HI> They have variety of <HI>Fi&s;h;</HI> all which, by rea&s;on of their Plenty. and becau&s;e many of the Natives eat no kind of Fle&s;h at all&punc; nor of any thing that hath or may have life, and tho&s;e that feed on &s;uch things eat not freely of any of tho&s;e living Creatures they are all bought there at &s;uch ea&s;y rates, as if they were not worth the valuing. They do not cut their Chickens when they be little to make Capons, and therefore they have no Creatures of that name, but men, their Eunuchs called there <HI>Cogees</HI> or Capons in their Language: &s;o made, when they be very young, and then deprived of all that might after pro|voke jealou&s;ie; and therefore they are put to be attendants on their women, the great men of that Nation keeping many of them, a &s;oft, tender people, <HI>tener Spado,</HI> as <HI>Juvenal</HI> cals one of them, that never come to have any <HI>Hair</HI> on their <HI>Faces.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="63">
But to return again to their Provi&s;ions, the <HI>Beeves</HI> of that Countrey differ from ours, in that there are none of them very large; and tho&s;e they have, have each of them a great <HI>bunch</HI> of gri&s;ly fle&s;h which grows upon the meeting of their <HI>&s;houlders.</HI> The <HI>fle&s;h</HI> of their <HI>Beeves</HI> is much <HI>whiter</HI> than the fle&s;h of <HI>ours,</HI> and very &s;weet, tender and good. Their <HI>Sheep</HI> differ from ours by their great fle&s;hy <HI>Bob-tails,</HI> which &s;e|vered from their bodies are very ponderous. Their <HI>Wool</HI> is generally <HI>coar&s;e,</HI> but their fle&s;h is not &s;o.</P>
<P>Now to &s;ea&s;on all their good Provi&s;ions, there is great &s;tore of <HI>Salt;</HI> and to &s;weeten all, abundance of <HI>Sugar</HI> growing in that Countrey; which, after it is well refined, may be there had at a very low rate; out of which they make very pure white <HI>Sugar-Candy,</HI> which may be had there at a &s;mall ea&s;y Price likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Fruits are every way an&s;werable to the re&s;t, the Countrey abounding in <HI>Musk-Melons</HI> (very much better, becau&s;e they are better di|ge&s;ted there by the heat of the Sun, than the&s;e with us) They have many <HI>Water-Melons,</HI> a very choyce good Fruit, and &s;ome of them as big as our ordinary <HI>Pompions,</HI> and in &s;hape like them; the &s;ub&s;tance within this Fruit is &s;pongie, but exceeding tender and well ta&s;ted, of a colour within equally mixed with <HI>red</HI> &amp; <HI>white,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="64">
and within that an excellent <HI>cooling</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ing liquor.</HI> Here are likewi&s;e &s;tore of <HI>Pome-granats, Pome-citrons;</HI> here are <HI>Limons</HI> and <HI>Oranges,</HI> but I never found any there &s;o good as I have &s;een el&s;where. Here are <HI>Dates, Figs, Grapes, Prunelloes, Almonds, Coquernuts</HI> (of which I ob&s;erved &s;omething before) and here they have tho&s;e mo&s;t excellent <HI>Plums</HI> called <HI>Mirabolans,</HI> the &s;tone of which Fruit differs very much from others in its &s;hape, whereon Nature hath cu|riou&s;ly quartered &s;everal &s;trakes equally divided, very pretty to behold; many of which choyce <HI>Plums</HI> (they write) are very cordial, and there|fore worth the prizing, are there well pre&s;erved, and &s;ent for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>They have to the&s;e another Fruit we Engli&s;h there call a <HI>Planten,</HI> of which many of them grow in <HI>Clu&s;ters</HI> together; long they are in &s;hape, made like unto &s;lender <HI>Cucumbers,</HI> and very yellow when they are Ripe, and then ta&s;t like unto a <HI>Norwich Pear,</HI> but much better. Another mo&s;t excellent Fruit they have, called a <HI>Manggo,</HI> growing upon Trees as big as our <HI>Walnut-trees;</HI> and as the&s;e here, &s;o tho&s;e Trees there, will be very full of that mo&s;t excellent Fruit, in &s;hape and colour like unto our <HI>Apri|cocks,</HI> but much bigger; which taken and rolled in a mans hands when they are through ripe, the &s;ub&s;tance within them becomes like the <HI>pap</HI> of a <HI>roa&s;ted Apple,</HI> which then &s;uck'd
<PB N="97" REF="64">
out from about a large &s;tone they have within them, is delicately plea&s;ing unto every <HI>Palate</HI> that ta&s;ts it. And to conclude with the be&s;t of all other their choyce Fruits, the <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anas,</HI> like unto our <HI>Pine-Apples,</HI> which &s;eems to the Ta|&s;ter to be a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Compound made of <HI>Strawberies, Claret-wine, Ro&s;e-water</HI> and <HI>Sugar</HI> well tempered together. In the Northernmo&s;t parts of this Empire they have variety of <HI>Pears</HI> and <HI>Apples,</HI> every where good <HI>Roots,</HI> as <HI>Car|rets, Potatoes,</HI> and others like them. They have <HI>Onions</HI> and <HI>Garlick,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Herbs</HI> and &s;mall <HI>Roots</HI> for <HI>Salads;</HI> and in the Southern|mo&s;t parts, <HI>Ginger</HI> growing almo&s;t in every place: the large Races whereof are there very excellently well pre&s;erved, as we may know by our ta&s;ting them in <HI>England.</HI> And all the&s;e things I have la&s;t named may be there likewi&s;e bought at very low rates And la&s;tly, &s;ome one kind or other of their very good and choyce Fruits may be there had at every time or &s;ea&s;on of the Year.</P>
<P>And here I cannot chu&s;e but take notice of a very plea&s;ant and clear liquor, called <HI>Toddie</HI> i&s;&s;uing from a Spongie Tree, that grows &s;trait and tall without Bowes to the top, and there &s;preads out in tender branches, very like unto tho&s;e that grow from the Roots of our rank and rich <HI>Artichokes,</HI> but much bigger and longer. This <HI>Toddie-tree</HI> is not &s;o big, but that it may
<PB N="98" REF="65">
be very ea&s;ily embraced, and the nimble people of that Countrey will climb up as fa&s;t to the top thereof (the &s;tem of the Tree being rough and cru&s;ty) as if they had the advantage of Ladders to help them up. In the top tender branches of tho&s;e Trees they make inci&s;ions, which they open and &s;top again as they plea&s;e, under which they hang Pots made of large and light <HI>Gourds,</HI> to pre&s;erve the influence which i&s;&s;ues out of them in a large quantity in the night &s;ea&s;on, they &s;topping up tho&s;e vents in the heat of the day. That which thus di&s;tils forth in the night, if it be taken very early in the mor|ning, is as plea&s;ing to the ta&s;t as any new <HI>White|wine,</HI> and much clearer than it. It is a very piercing, and medicinable, and moffen&s;ive drink, if taken betimes in the day, onely it is a little windy: but if it be kept till the heat of the day, the Sun alters it &s;o, as if it made it an|other kind of liquor, for it becomes then very heady, not &s;o well reli&s;hed, and unwhol&s;ome; and when it is &s;o not a few of our drunken <HI>Sea-men</HI> chu&s;e to drink it; and I think they &s;o do, becau&s;e it will then pre&s;ently turn their brains; for there are too too many of the common &s;ort of tho&s;e men who u&s;e the Sea, who love tho&s;e bruti&s;h di&s;tempers too much, which turn a man out of him&s;elf, and leave a Bea&s;t in the skin of a man. But for that drink, if it be taken in its be&s;t, and mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on, I conceive it to be
<PB N="99" REF="65">
of it &s;elf very whol&s;ome, becau&s;e it provokes urine exceedingly; the further benefit whereof &s;ome there have found by happy experience, thereby ea&s;ed from their torture inflicted, by that &s;hame of Phy&s;icians, and Tyran of all Maladies, the <HI>Stone.</HI> And &s;o cheap too is this mo&s;t plea&s;ing Wine, that a man may there have more than enough for a very little money.</P>
<P>At <HI>Surat,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Agra,</HI> and beyond, it &s;eldome or never <HI>rains,</HI> but one &s;ea&s;on of the year; but yet there is a refre&s;hing <HI>Dew</HI> during all that time <HI>the Heavens there are thus &s;hut up,</HI> which every night fals, and <HI>cools,</HI> and <HI>com|forts,</HI> and <HI>refre&s;heth</HI> the face of the <HI>earth.</HI> Tho&s;e general <HI>Rains</HI> begin near the time that the Sun comes to the Northern <HI>Tropick,</HI> and &s;o con|tinue till his return back to the <HI>Line.</HI> The&s;e &s;howers at their beginning mo&s;t extremely vio|lent&punc; are u&s;her'd in&punc; and u&s;ually take their leave with mo&s;t fearful Tempe&s;ts of <HI>Thunder. Light|ning,</HI> more terrible than I can expre&s;s, yet &s;eldome do harm; the rea&s;on in Nature may be, the &s;ubtilty of the <HI>Air</HI> in tho&s;e parts where|in there are fewer <HI>Thunder-&s;tones</HI> made, than in &s;uch <HI>Climates</HI> where the Air is <HI>thick, gro&s;s,</HI> and <HI>cloudy.</HI> During tho&s;e three months it rains u&s;ually every day more or le&s;s, &s;ometimes one whole quarter of the <HI>Moon</HI> together, &s;carce without any intermi&s;&s;ion; which abundance of moy&s;ture, with the heat of the Sun, doth &s;o
<PB N="100" REF="66">
enrich their Land, which they never force (if I ob&s;erved right) by Soyling of it, as that, like <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the inundation of <HI>Nilus,</HI> it makes it fruitful all the year after. When the time of this <HI>Rain</HI> is pa&s;&s;ed over, the face of the Skye there is pre&s;ently &s;o &s;erene and clear, as that &s;carcely one <HI>Cloud</HI> appears in their <HI>Hemi&s;phere</HI> the nine months after.</P>
<P>And here a &s;trong Argument that may fur|ther, and mo&s;t infallibly &s;hew the goodne&s;s of their Soyl, &s;hall not e&s;cape my Pen, mo&s;t ap|parent in this, That when the Ground there hath been de&s;titute of Rain nine months to|gether, and looks all of it like the barren Sands in the De&s;erts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where there is not one &s;pire of green Gra&s;s to be found, within a few daies after tho&s;e fat enriching &s;howers begin to fall, the face of the Earth there (as it were by a new <HI>Re&s;urrection)</HI> is &s;o revived, and through|out &s;o renewed, as that it is pre&s;ently covered all over with a pure <HI>green Mantle.</HI> And more|over, to confirm that which before I ob&s;erved concerning the goodne&s;s of that Soyl, among&s;t many hundred Acres of <HI>Corn</HI> of divers kinds I have there beheld, I never &s;aw any but what was very <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> &s;tanding as thick on the Ground as the Land could well bear it.</P>
<P>They till their Ground with Oxen and Foot-Ploughs, their Seed-time in <HI>May,</HI> and the be|ginning of <HI>June,</HI> they taking their time to di&s;|patch
<PB N="101" REF="66">
all that work before that long Rainy &s;ea|&s;on comes; and though the Ground then hath been all the time we named before without any &s;ufficient moy&s;ture by &s;howers, or otherwi&s;e, to &s;upple and make it more fit for tilliage, yet the Soyl there is &s;uch a brittle fat mould (which they &s;ow year after year) as that they can very ea&s;ily till it. Their Harve&s;t is in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> the mo&s;t temperate months of all that year.</P>
<P>Their Ground is not enclo&s;ed, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;mall quanty near <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Villages,</HI> which &s;tand &s;cattered up and down this va&s;t Empire very thick, though, for want of the true names, not in&s;erted in the Map.</P>
<P>They mow not their Gra&s;s (as we) to make Hay, but cut it off the ground, either green, or withered, as they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>They &s;ow <HI>Tobacco</HI> in abundance, and they take it too very much, but after a &s;trange way much different from us; for fir&s;t, they have little Earthen Pots, &s;haped like our &s;mall <HI>Flower-pots,</HI> having a narrow neck, and an open round top, out of the belly of which comes a &s;mall &s;pout, to the lower part of which &s;pout they fill the Pot with water, then putting their <HI>Tobacco</HI> loo&s;e in the top, and a burning coal upon it, they having fir&s;t fa&s;tned a very &s;mall &s;trait hollow <HI>Cane</HI> or <HI>Reed</HI> (not bigger than a &s;mall Arrow) within that &s;pout, a yard or ell
<PB N="102" REF="67">
long, the Pot &s;tanding on the ground, draw that &s;moak into their mouths, which fir&s;t falls upon the Superficies of the water, and much di&s;|colours it. And this way of taking their <HI>To|bacco,</HI> they believe, makes it much more cool and whol&s;ome. The <HI>Tobacco</HI> which grows there is doubtle&s;s in the Plant as good as in any other place of the world, but they know not how to cure and order it, like tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> to make it &s;o rich and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The Countrey is beautified with many <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Groves</HI> of Trees, in which tho&s;e winged <HI>Chori&s;ters</HI> make &s;weet Mu&s;ick. In tho&s;e Woods &s;ome excellent <HI>Hawks</HI> make their ne&s;ts, and there are very often to be &s;een great flocks of <HI>Parakeetoes,</HI> or little <HI>Parrats,</HI> who have their breeding and lodging among&s;t tho&s;e Melancholy Shades. And (in the number of many other Creatures covered with Feathers) there are &s;ome very little Birds le&s;s than our <HI>Wrens,</HI> who are exceeding pretty, for their neat &s;hape, and their covering, with mo&s;t curious parti-colour'd Fea|thers, full of variety of little &s;pots. I have &s;een there many of tho&s;e rare Creatures kept to|gether in large Cages, who plea&s;e the <HI>Eye</HI> with their curious <HI>Colours,</HI> and the <HI>Ear</HI> with their variety of plea&s;ant <HI>Notes.</HI> The <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Groves</HI> in the Southernmo&s;t parts of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> have great &s;tore of wild <HI>Apes,</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> and <HI>Baboons</HI> in them, &s;ome of which I have &s;een
<PB N="103" REF="67">
as high as our talle&s;t <HI>Greyhounds,</HI> which live among the Trees, and climbe them at plea&s;ure. Tho&s;e <HI>Apes, &amp;c.</HI> are very terrible to tho&s;e little Birds, which make their Ne&s;ts in tho&s;e Woods; and therefore Nature hath taught them this &s;ubtilty (to pre&s;erve their young ones from tho&s;e Creatures which would otherwi&s;e de&s;troy them) to build their Ne&s;ts in the twigs, and the utmo&s;t boughs of tho&s;e Trees, where &s;ome of them hang like little Pur&s;e-nets, to which tho&s;e <HI>Apes</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> be they never &s;o little and light, cannot come to hurt them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their Woods, they have great variety of fair goodly Trees that &s;tand here and there &s;ingle, but I never &s;aw any there of tho&s;e kinds of Trees which <HI>England</HI> affords.

<P>Their Trunks are gri&s;ly &s;nouts of a great length, hanging down betwixt their long teeth, which teeth nature hath given them for their de|fence, otherwi&s;e they are of little u&s;e to them. In their Trunks they have &s;uch marvellous &s;trength, that by them they can do very much mi&s;chief, for if they &s;trike an Hor&s;e, or Camel, or any other the like bea&s;t with them, (as &s;ometimes they do when as they are mad) they will &s;o break their bones, as that they will &s;poyl, nay kill them at one blow, and much more a man if he chance to come in their way.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Trunks of the <HI>Elephants</HI> are to them as an hand by which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eed them&s;elves, and make great u&s;e of them otherwi&s;e upon all occa|&s;ions, for with tho&s;e Trunks they tear off bowghs

from trees, by winding them about them, and after, with them, put boughs into their mouths, and eat the tendere&s;t parts of them. With the&s;e they pull up green corn (if they be &s;uffered) and gra&s;s by the roots, and then again&s;t their leggs beat off the earth and du&s;t that hangs a|bout them, before they eat thereof. Thus they deal with &s;edgs, or weeds which they find in the water, fir&s;t wa&s;hing off the dirt which hangs on the roots thereof, and then down they go in|to their va&s;t bellyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephants</HI> delight much to bathe them|&s;elves in water, in which, when they find depth enough, they &s;wim as well as any other Crea|tures.</P>

At tho&s;e times to prevent mi&s;chief they are kept apart from Company, fetterd with &s;trong chaines unto trees; but if by chance in their phren&s;ie they get loo&s;e (as &s;ometimes they do) they will make after every thing they &s;ee &s;tir, in which ca&s;e they have no means to &s;top them

Natives to wait upon them, who by turnes two and two together carried them up and down with him in <HI>Palankees,</HI> (after de&s;cribed) to which they were tyed, and the other two went by them, fanning the flyes from off them; and the King cau&s;ed a pair of &s;ilver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ongs to be made on purpo&s;e, that with them when he plea&s;ed, he might feed tho&s;e dogs with his own hand.

<P>The&s;e va&s;t Creatures, though the Countrey be exceeding fruitfull, and all provi&s;ions in it cheap, yet by rea&s;on of their huge bulk, if they be well kept and fed, are very chargeable in keeping; they are kept u&s;ually under the &s;hade of great trees, where by a &s;trong chain of iron upon one of their hinde leggs they fa&s;ten them.

One of our Com|pany (who had been in <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> a year or two before) told them, that what they had done they did without ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ire, and therefore they &s;hould have nothing from us, but &s;ome ill language which he then gave them. We &s;et forward in the morning according to our wonted cu&s;tom they followed after us, to the number at the lea&s;t of three hundred men (for the place was great and populous) and when we were gone about a mile from that Town, &s;topped our carriages; he of our Company who told them they &s;hould have no recompence, was pre&s;ently ready to &s;hoot at them with his <HI>Mu&s;|ket,</HI> which made them all to bend their Bowes at us, but I happily and &s;uddenly &s;tepping in, prevented his firing at them, and their &s;hooting at us, which if I had not by Gods good Provi|dence done, but we had madly engaged &s;uch a great multitude, there could not have been le&s;s expected in the &s;ad i&s;&s;ue thereof, than the

lo&s;s of all our lives, and goods, but having a little Parlee with them, for the value of three &s;hillings of Engli&s;h money given among&s;t them, they were all quieted and contented, and im|mediatly left us, wi&s;hing us a good journey.</P>
<P>After this, when we had gone forward a|bout twenty dayes journey (which daily re|mooves were but &s;hort, by rea&s;on of our heavy carriages, and the heat of the weather) it hap|pened, that another of our Company, a young Gentleman about twenty years old, the Bro|ther of a Baron of <HI>England,</HI> behaved him&s;elf &s;o ill, as that we feared it would have brought very much mi&s;chief on us.</P>
<P>This young man being very unruly at home, and &s;o many others that have been well born, when their friends knew not what to do with them, have been &s;ent to <HI>Ea&s;t India,</HI> that &s;o they might make their own <HI>Graves</HI> in the <HI>Sea,</HI> in their pa&s;&s;age thither, or els have <HI>Graves</HI> made for them on the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hore, when they come there. A very cleanly conveyance (but how ju&s;t and hone&s;t, I leave to others) for Parents to be rid of their unruly Children; but I never knew any who were thus &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ent thither, but they outlived that voyage.</P>
<P>For the young Gentleman I &s;pake of, his im|ployment was to wait upon our chief Com|mander in his Cabin, who very courteou&s;ly when he came to Sea, turn'd him before the

<HI>ma&s;t</HI> among&s;t the common &s;aylors [a great pre|ferment for a man of his birth,] but for all this he outliv'd that har&s;h u&s;age, and came &s;afely to <HI>Ea&s;t India,</HI> and my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour hea|ring of him, and being well acquainted with his great kindred, &s;ent for him up to the <HI>Court,</HI> and there entertain'd him as a Companion for a year, then giving him all fit accommodati|ons, &s;ent him home again as a pa&s;&s;enger for England, where after he &s;afely arrived.</P>
<P>But in our way towards that Court, it thus happened, that this <HI>hot-brains</HI> being a little behind us, commanded him [then neer him] who was the Princes &s;ervant [before &s;poken of] to hold his hor&s;e, the man replyed, that he was none of his &s;ervant, and would not do it. Upon which this mo&s;t intemperate mad youth, who was like <HI>Philocles</HI> that angry Poet; and therefore called <HI>Bilis, &amp; Sal&s;igo,</HI> Choler and Brine, [for he was the mo&s;t ha&s;ty and cho|lerick young man that ever I knew] as will ap|pear by his pre&s;ent carriage, which was thus; fir&s;t he beat that &s;tranger, for refu&s;ing to hold his hor&s;e, with his hor&s;e-whip, which I mu&s;t tell you, that people cannot endure, as if tho&s;e whips &s;tung wor&s;e than <HI>Scopions.</HI> For of any puni&s;hments that carry mo&s;t di&s;grace in them, as that people think one is to be beaten with that <HI>whip,</HI> where with all they &s;trike their bea&s;ts; the other to be beaten [and this they e&s;teem the

But this &s;tranger (being whipt as before) came up and com|plained to me, but to make him amends, that <HI>frantick young man</HI> (mad with rage, and he knew not wherefore) pre&s;ently followed him, and being come up clo&s;e to him, di&s;charg'd his <HI>Pi&s;tol</HI> laden with a brace of <HI>bullets</HI> directly at his body, which bullets, by the &s;pecial guidance of the hand of God, &s;o flew, that they did the poor man no great hurt, only one of them fir&s;t tearing his coat, bru&s;ed all the knucles of his left hand and the other brake his bow which he carried in the &s;ame hand. We pre&s;ently di&s;|armed our young <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dlam,</HI> till he might return again to his witts. But our greate&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was how to pacifie the other man whom he had thus injured: I pre&s;ently gave him a <HI>Roo|pee;</HI> in our money two &s;hillings and nine pence; he thanked me for it, and would have taken it with his right, but I de&s;ired him to take it with his maym'd hand, and &s;o he did, and could clinch it very well, which I was glad of. Then we did &s;hew (as we had cau&s;e) all the di&s;like we could again&s;t that de&s;perat act of him, from whom he received his hurt, telling him, that we were all &s;trangers, and for our parts had done him no wrong at all, and there|fore hoped that we &s;hould not be made any way to &s;uffer for the faults of another, and we
<PB N="179" REF="104">
further told him, that if he would be quiet till we came up to the <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> he &s;hould have all the &s;atisfaction he could de&s;ire. He told us, that we were good men, and had done him no wrong, and that he would til then re&s;t contented; but he did not &s;o, for about two houres after we met with a great man of that Countrey, having a mighty train with him, (as al the <HI>Grandees</HI> there have when they travel (of whom more after|ward) He pre&s;ently went towards him, that to him he might make his complaint; and &s;o did, telling him, that he was the <HI>Princes</HI> &s;er|vant, why he came to us, and how he had been u&s;ed by us, &s;hewing him his hand and his other breaches. The great man replied, that it was not well done of us, but he had nothing to do with it, and &s;o departed on his way. That night, after we came to a &s;trong large Town, and pla|cing our &s;elves on the &s;ide of it, he did what he could (as we imagined) to ray&s;e up that peo|ple again&s;t us, &s;ome of them comming about us to view us, as we conceived, but putting on the be&s;t confidence we could, and &s;tanding then upon our guard, and all of us watching that night, but (in a &s;pecial manner) by the good providence of God, who kept us in all our journey, we here felt none of that mi&s;chief we feared, but early in the morning quietly de|parted without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation. After which, with a little money, and a great many
<PB N="180" REF="105">
good words, we &s;o quieted this man, that we never after heard any more complaining from him. So that (as before I ob&s;erved) we were not at any time in any dangers of &s;uffering by that people, but &s;ome of our own Nation were the procuring cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>For the people there, they are generally very Civil, and u&s;ually keep them&s;elves &s;o within the bounds of command received from their &s;u|periours, over which they do not pa&s;s, as that they are not apt to take fire, and to throw off their voak, that they might do mi&s;chief; They happily con&s;idering, that as in a <HI>natural,</HI> &s;o in a <HI>body Politick,</HI> there mu&s;t be hands and feet, as well as <HI>head</HI> and <HI>&s;houlders,</HI> all parts as well as any, the defect of the lea&s;t being &s;o prejudi|cial to both tho&s;e bodyes, that they know not how to want it; But for both, when they are fitted with all their integral parts, all mem|bers mu&s;t do their &s;everal offices, the <HI>foot</HI> not medling with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Head,</HI> fur|ther than to receive Commands from it.

<P>I have often heard it ob&s;erved of the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> that they are <HI>Optimi &s;ervi,</HI> but <HI>Pe&s;&s;imi Domini,</HI> ill Ma&s;ters, but good &s;ervants. I &s;hall not fur|ther enquire into the truth of that proverbial &s;peech; but, for this people, this I can affirm; that they are excellent &s;ervants, who are as much at the command of their Ma&s;ters, as the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after the death of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> were unto <HI>Jo&s;hua, Jo&s;h.</HI> 1. 17. there telling him, <HI>all that thou commande&s;t us we will do, or whither|&s;oever thou &s;ende&s;t us we will goe;</HI> Or as the <HI>Cen|turions</HI> &s;ervants in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> were at the word of command to their Captain, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 9. who, <HI>if he bad them go, they went, if come, they came, if do this, or that, they did it:</HI> So the&s;e, if they be commanded to carry letters of a &s;ud|den many miles di&s;tant, from one place to ano|ther, they yield obedience in this, as to all other the commands of their Ma&s;ters, without regret
<PB N="182" REF="106">
or di&s;pute, not <HI>objecting</HI> again&s;t, but doing the wills of tho&s;e that imploy them.</P>
<P>Before I ob&s;erved, that for the generality of this people they have very low and timorous &s;pirits, but there are &s;ome I named in my la&s;t Section, who are &s;tout daring men, as the <HI>Ba|loches, Patans,</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;hbootes,</HI> who, as they have the honour above all the re&s;t of the people in tho&s;e large Provinces to be accounted va|liant; &s;o, as occa&s;ion is offered, they will &s;hew them&s;elves &s;o to be: and therefore they are much hyred as Convoyes to &s;ecure mens Per|&s;ons and goods, from place to place.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e Provinces, they are not without <HI>Mountains of prey, and Tabernacles of Robbers,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> &s;peak, where de&s;perate men keep in &s;ome <HI>woods</HI> and <HI>de&s;erts,</HI> which are not far from great road-wayes, mo&s;t frequented &amp; u&s;ed, and there, like the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> in Com|panies meet, and &s;poyl, and de&s;troy poor pa&s;|&s;engers, when they expect them not; it being the cur&s;ed manner of tho&s;e <HI>&s;poylers,</HI> if they pre|vail again&s;t; them whom they &s;urpri&s;e, to kill them before they rifle them, and therefore the fir&s;t thing heard from them is, <HI>Mor, mor, mor,</HI> that is, Kill, kill, kill, which they all &s;peak out as loud as they can. We were often told of them as we travelled &s;ometimes in the night, by rea|&s;on of the extreme heat of the day, after we had taken leave of the King; and &s;o wer jour|
<PB N="183" REF="106">
journeying towards <HI>Surat,</HI> that we &s;hould meet with tho&s;e cruell <HI>villans,</HI> but, through Gods mercy, we were never in danger of them but once, and that was about midnight, neer a large City called <HI>Brodera,</HI> but we being a competent number of Engli&s;h men together, about twenty, and all of us re&s;olved to fell our lives at as dear a rate as we could, and having twice &s;o many <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ervants with us, which are very nimble with their Bows and Arrowes, we with our Pi&s;tols and Carbines, which we pre&s;ently di&s;charged among&s;t them, and our <HI>In|dians</HI> plying them with their arrowes, made them &s;uddenly to retreat, we receiving little hurt from them, but after this we made no more night <HI>marches.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> I named before, are &s;o faith|full to their tru&s;ts unto whom&s;oever they en|gage, to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as well as to any <HI>other,</HI> that if they be at any time a&s;&s;aulted, they will rather dye in their defence, than for&s;ake them at their need. So that I am very confident, that if an Engli&s;h Merchant &s;hould travel alone with a very great trea&s;ure in <HI>gold,</HI> and <HI>Jewels,</HI> both, or either, from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Lahor,</HI> which is more than one thou&s;and Engli&s;h miles, and take tho&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ervants only for his compa|ny, and guard, and all they knew what be car|ried with him, He paying them their wages, they would be &s;o far from injuring him of the
<PB N="184" REF="107">
lea&s;t penny of his wealth, that who&s;oever be|&s;ides &s;hould attempt his &s;poyling, mu&s;t make a way through their blood, before they &s;hould be able to do it</P>
<P>Here is a great and good example of Faith|fulne&s;s, and it is very true. But I much doubt, that if a great <HI>Indian</HI> Merchant, I mean a na|tive of that Countrey, &s;hould come for <HI>England</HI> with the like trea&s;ure, with a de&s;ire to pa&s;s through this whole nation, and &s;hould for his more &s;afe pa&s;&s;age take a guard of &s;word|men here, and pay them well for their &s;ervice, they might lye under &s;uch a &s;trong tentation, as might make them to &s;poyl the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> by &s;hortning his journey, dividing his &s;ub&s;tance, and by di&s;po&s;ing &s;o of his per&s;on, that it &s;hould never tell tales.</P>
<P>But for that people, as their faithfulne&s;s is ve|ry remarkable, &s;o is their diligence very exem|plary likewi&s;e; for they keep continually within the call of their Ma&s;ters, and will not at any time depart thence without &s;pecial leave. And the plenty of all provi&s;ions being very great throughout the whole <HI>Monarchy,</HI> they &s;erve at very low rates, which I never knew them to ray&s;e, not requiring more than five &s;hillings &s;ter|lings every new Moon, payd the next day after its Change, which is all the recompence they do de&s;ire, or expect from their Ma&s;ters, to provide them&s;elves with all nece&s;&s;aries</P>

<P>It is their manner in many places, to plant a|bout, and among&s;t their buildings, trees which grow high and broad, the &s;hadow whereof keeps their hou&s;es by far more cool; this I ob|&s;erved in a &s;pecial manner when we were ready to enter <HI>Amadavar,</HI> for it appeared to us, as if we had been entring a Wood, rather than a City. That <HI>Amadavar</HI> is a very large and po|pulous City, entred by many fair Gates girt a|bout with an high and thick Wall of Brick, which mounts above the topps of their hou&s;es, without which wall there are no &s;uburbs.

<P>The <HI>Mogols</HI> Palace Royal is at <HI>Agra</HI> his <HI>Metropolis</HI> (of which more afterward) but for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall take a little notice of a very curious <HI>Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> I &s;aw belonging to his hou&s;e at <HI>Mandoa,</HI> which &s;tood a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, for the building of which there was a way made into a firm Rock, which &s;hewed it &s;elf on the &s;ide of an Hill, <HI>Canopied</HI> over with part of that Rock. It was a place that had much beauty in it by rea&s;on of the Curious work-man&s;hip be&s;towed on it; and much plea&s;ure by rea&s;on of its coolene&s;s.</P>
<P>That City <HI>Mandoa</HI> I &s;peak of, is &s;ituated upon a very high mountain, the to whereof is flat, and plain, and &s;pecious. From all parts that lye about it but one, the a&s;cent is very high, and &s;teep; and the way to us &s;eemed exceeding long, for we were two whole dayes Climbing up the Hill, with our Cariages, vvhich vve got up vvith very much difficulty; not far from the bottom of vvhich Hill, vve lodged at a great tovvn called <HI>Achabar-pore,</HI> vvhere vve ferried over a broad River (as vve did in other places) for I ob&s;erved no bridges made there, over any of their Rivers vvhere their high-vvayes lye.

(as it vvere) vvith fair trees, that keep their di&s;tance &s;o one from and belovv the other, that there is much delight in beholding them either from the bottom or top of that Hill.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e va&s;t and far extended woods, there are <HI>Lions, Tygres,</HI> and other bea&s;ts of Prey, and many wild <HI>Elephants.</HI> We lay one night in that wood with our Carriages, and tho&s;e <HI>Lions</HI> came about us di&s;covering them&s;elves by their Roaring, but we keeping a very good fire all night, they came not neer enough to hurt ei|ther our &s;elves, or cattel; tho&s;e Cruel Bea&s;ts are night-walkers, for in the day they appear not.</P>
<P>After (when through Gods mo&s;t gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance) we had overcome tho&s;e difficulties, and dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, we came into a plain and even Countrey in which travelling a few dayes more we fir&s;t met with my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador mar|ching towards <HI>Mandoa</HI> with that great King, with whom I then &s;etled, and continued with him, till he was returned home.</P>

us in our cour&s;e was, that he might &s;ee the pre|&s;ents we had for his Father the King; but we having command from the Amba&s;&s;ador to tell him, that we dur&s;t not open them, till we came to the King, we mo&s;t humbly craved his pardon to &s;pare us in that; &s;o pre&s;enting him with a pair of Rich <HI>Gloves</HI> (though they be things they wear not in tho&s;e hot Countryes) and a rich embrodered bag for perfume (which among&s;t many other things of the like kinde were brought from <HI>England</HI> to be given away for pre&s;ents, after that he had carried us back three dayes journey, he let us go, taking further order for our &s;afe Convoy.</P>
<P>And now Reader, thou may&s;t &s;uppo&s;e us al|mo&s;t &s;etled in <HI>Mandoa,</HI> the place then of the <HI>Mogols</HI> re&s;idence, not much inhabited before we came thither, having more <HI>ruines</HI> by far a|bout it, than &s;tanding <HI>hou&s;es.</HI> But among&s;t the Piles of building that had held up their heads above <HI>Ruin,</HI> there were not a few unfrequen|ted <HI>Mo&s;quits</HI> or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Churches; yet I ob&s;erved, that though the people who attended the King there, were marvailou&s;ly &s;treightned for room, wherein they might di&s;po&s;e of very great numbers of mo&s;t excellent hor&s;es, which were now at that place, they would not make &s;tables of any of tho&s;e Churches, though before that time, they had been for&s;aken, and out of u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="113">
One of tho&s;e de&s;erted <HI>Mo&s;quites,</HI> with &s;ome large <HI>Tomb</HI> neer it, both vaulted over head (which &s;hall be after de&s;cribed) were the be&s;t places there to be gotten for my Lord Amba&s;|&s;adour and his Company to lodge and be in, we carrying our bedding, and all things apper|tayning thereto, all nece&s;&s;aries belonging to our Kitchin, and every thing be&s;ide for bodily u&s;e, from place to place, as we occa&s;ionally remoo|ved. Here we &s;tayed with the <HI>Mogol</HI> from the middle of <HI>April,</HI> till the twentieth of <HI>Septem|ber</HI> following and then began our progre&s;s with him, towards the City <HI>Amadavar.</HI></P>
<P>Our abiding place at <HI>Mandoa,</HI> was very neer one of the &s;ides of that va&s;t wilderne&s;s, out of which, &s;ome of tho&s;e wild bea&s;ts ofttimes in the night came about our habitation, and &s;el|dom returned back without a <HI>Sheep</HI> or a <HI>Goate,</HI> or a <HI>Kid,</HI> &s;ome of which we always kept about us for our provi&s;ion. And it was a wonderfull great mercy, tho&s;e furious, and ravening, and and hungerbit Creatures, did not make their prey &s;ometimes, in the dark and &s;ilent nights, while we were &s;leeping, on &s;ome of our bodyes, the fore-part of our dwelling &s;tanding upon pillars, and there was nothing in tho&s;e open di|&s;tances, that had any &s;trength in it to keep them from us.</P>
<P>One night, early in the evening, there was a great <HI>Lion</HI> which we &s;aw, came into our yard,
<PB N="197" REF="113">
though our yard was compa&s;&s;ed about with a &s;tone-wall, that was not low.) And my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour having a little white neat <HI>&s;hock,</HI> that ran out barking at him, the Lion prefently &s;napt him up, leapt again over the wall, and a|way he went.</P>
<P>But for a ravening and roaring <HI>Lion,</HI> as I be|lieve that he cannot be made tame when he is old; yet certainly he may be bred tame, being kept full, and high fed. For the <HI>Mogol,</HI> at my being there, had a very great <HI>Lion</HI> (I often &s;aw) which went up and down, among&s;t the people that frequented his Court, gently as a dog, and never did hurt only he had &s;ome Keepers which did continually wayt upon him.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e wild and Cruell Bea&s;ts, one of our <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> watching in a tree by night; (that &s;tood not far from our dwelling) with a fire-lock charged with &s;ome &s;mall bullets, &s;hot a <HI>Tygre,</HI> and kill'd him &s;tone&punc; dead, as he was comming towards us. It was a large Bea&s;t, higher than an <HI>Iri&s;h-Greyhound,</HI> with Grizled hayr, a long head, and &s;harp and &s;hort picked eares, having a mouth filled with cruell teeth; after which (we u&s;ually keeping a little fire without our hou&s;e every night) were not &s;o much troubled with tho&s;e night-walkers.</P>
<P>Now to return to that from which I am oc|ca&s;ionally digre&s;&s;ed. I told you before what their buildings are. And now for the furniture
<PB N="198" REF="114">
that the greate&s;t men have in them, it is <HI>Curta &s;upellex,</HI> very little; they being not beautified with hangings, nor with any thing be&s;ides to line their walls, but where they are be&s;t adorned, they are kept very white, and &s;et off with a little neat painting and nothing el&s;e; for they have no <HI>Chaires,</HI> nor <HI>&s;tooles,</HI> nor <HI>couches,</HI> nor <HI>tables,</HI> nor <HI>bedds,</HI> enclo&s;ed with <HI>Canopies,</HI> or <HI>Curtains,</HI> in any of their rooms. And the truth is, that if they had them, the extreme heat there would forbid the u&s;e of many of them; all their brave|ry is upon their <HI>&s;loores,</HI> all which are made even with fine earth, or pla&s;ter, on which they &s;pead their mo&s;t excellent <HI>Carpets</HI> in their Tents, as well as in their dwelling hou&s;es, laying &s;ome Coar&s;e thing under to pre&s;erve them; on which they &s;it as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aylors</HI> on their &s;hop-boards, when they meet together, putting off their &s;hooes (which they u&s;ually wear as &s;lippers and their feet bare in them) when they come to tred up|on tho&s;e &s;oft <HI>Pavements,</HI> and keeping them off till they remoove thence, this helps to keep cool their feet, and is very plea&s;ant in tho&s;e hot Countreyes. On tho&s;e Carpets they &s;leep in the night time, or el&s;e upon an hard quilt, or lying upon a &s;light and low bed-&s;tead they call a <HI>Cot,</HI> bottomed with broad girt-web made of <HI>Cotten-Wool.</HI> But where ever they lye, they &s;tretch them&s;elves out at their full length when they go to &s;leep, u&s;ually upon their backs, without any
<PB N="199" REF="114">
pillow, or bol&s;ter, to rai&s;e up their heads. Very many of the meaner &s;ort of people (as I have often ob&s;erved) lye thus &s;tretched out to take their re&s;t upon the ground, in the dry &s;ea|&s;on of the year, with a white Callico Cloth &s;pread all over them, which makes them to appear like &s;o many dead corps layd forth for burial. This lying &s;o even, and at length with their bodyes thus extended, may be one rea&s;on why the people there are all &s;o &s;treight lim'd, having none crooked among&s;t them, and another, becau&s;e they never girt, nor lace in their bodies (as before was ob&s;erved). Some of tho&s;e &s;light bed&s;teads, they call <HI>Cotts,</HI> in their &s;tanding hou&s;es hang by rops, a little above ground, which are fa&s;tned to the four corners thereof; moved gently up and down, by their &s;ervants, to lull them a&s;leep</P>
<P>They have no <HI>Inns</HI> in tho&s;e parts for the en|tertainment of &s;trangers, but in &s;ome great Townes large Hou&s;es they call <HI>Sarraas</HI> very &s;ub&s;tantially built, with brick, or &s;tone, where any pa&s;&s;engers may find hou&s;e-room and u&s;e it without any recompence; but there is nothing to be had be&s;ide room, all other things they mu&s;t provide and bring with them, as when they lodge in Tents.</P>
<P>Among&s;t their buildings I mu&s;t take &s;pecial notice of their <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Tankes,</HI> upon both which in very many places they be&s;tow excee|ding
<PB N="200" REF="115">
much co&s;t in &s;tone-work; for their <HI>Wells</HI> which are fed with Springs, they make them round, but very wide and large. They are wrought up with firm &s;tones layd in fine Pla|&s;ter; they u&s;ually cover tho&s;e Wells with a buil|ding over head, and with <HI>Oxen</HI> draw water out of them, which ri&s;eth up in many &s;mall Buckets, whereof &s;ome are alwayes going down, others continually comming up, and emptying them|&s;elves, in troughs, or little rills, made to receive, and Convey the water whither they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Tanks</HI> are made in low places, and many of them very deep and large, one mile, and &s;ome of them much more in compa&s;s, made round or four &s;quare, or in more &s;quares, about which there is a low &s;tone-wall, that hath ma|ny doors in it, and within that wall &s;teps, made one below the other round about it, that go down to the bottom thereof, (which is paved likewi&s;e) tho&s;e &s;teps are made of well &s;quared la&s;ting &s;tone, layd firm, and even in very good order, for people that have not plenty of water otherwi&s;e, to go down and take it. The&s;e great receptacles of water, are made neer places that are very populous, fill'd when that long &s;ea&s;on of rain (before &s;poken of) comes, immediatly before which time, they clen&s;e them, that the water may be more cleer, and whol&s;om. They hold water all the dry &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>For their places of plea&s;ure, they are in their
<PB N="201" REF="115">
Groves, where their curious fruit-trees (before de&s;cribed) grow; but e&s;pecially in their Gardens, wherein they plant little vineyards that afford marvailous fair &amp; &s;weet Grapes, which they cut green, for their eating, or make Rei&s;ons of them. But for Wine, they make none, becau&s;e their <HI>Mahomet</HI> forbids the drinking thereof. In tho&s;e Gardens likewi&s;e, they have many <HI>Pome-Granat-trees,</HI> with all other of the choy|&s;e&s;t <HI>fruits</HI> and <HI>flowers</HI> their Countrey affords; to which nature daily yields &s;uch a &s;upply, as that there is beauty to be &s;een in tho&s;e trees, and plants, and that continually. In the middle of tho&s;e Gardens, they have &s;uch Wells (as be|fore are de&s;cribed) the topps whereof &s;tand a good deal higher than the planted ground, which lyes even, and flat below them, from whence water is conveyed in narrow open pa&s;|&s;ages, (they knowing not the u&s;e of leaden Pipes) to all the parts of them in the dry &s;ea&s;on of the year. In tho&s;e Gardens likewi&s;e they have little round <HI>Tanks</HI> to bath in; who&s;e &s;ides and Bot|tomes are made firm and &s;mooth with that pla&s;ter before named; they are fil'd by <HI>aqua|ducts</HI> from tho&s;e Wells, and they can empty them when they plea&s;e, as well as fill them. The water that is conveyed into tho&s;e &s;mall <HI>Tanks,</HI> u&s;ually runns down broad &s;tone Tables, that have many Hollowes made in them, like to <HI>&s;collop-&s;hels,</HI> with water in its pa&s;&s;age, makes
<PB N="202" REF="116">
&s;uch a pretty murmure, as helps to tye their &s;en&s;es with the bonds of &s;leep, in the hot &s;ea|&s;ons of the day when they con&s;tantly keep their hou&s;es, and then they lye down neer them on their Carpetts, to be lul'd a&s;leep. Tho&s;e Bathing places are within, or very neer their Garden-hou&s;es, which u&s;ually are by far more neat, than any other of their dwelling.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a Garden-hou&s;e, with all tho&s;e ac|commodations about it, my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour lay with his company at <HI>Surat,</HI> the la&s;t three moneths before he left <HI>Ea&s;t India.</HI></P>
<P>And further, in tho&s;e hot &s;ea&s;ons of the day; the people of better quality lying or &s;itting on their <HI>Carpets,</HI> or <HI>Pallats,</HI> have &s;ervants &s;tanding about them, who continually beat the Air up|pon them with <HI>Flabellas,</HI> or <HI>Fanns,</HI> of &s;tiffened leather, which keeps off the flyes from annoy|ing them, and cool them as they lye. Thus ta|king their ea&s;e, they call for <HI>Barbers,</HI> who very gently gripe their armes, and &s;houlders, and other parts, they can in any mea&s;ure gra&s;p, and they &s;trike likewi&s;e very &s;oftly tho&s;e parts with the &s;ides of their hands; it is very plea&s;ing as they do it, and cau&s;eth their blood to &s;tir in their veins, it is therefore very much u&s;ed in tho&s;e parts, to &s;uch as do not heat their blood by bodily motion.</P>
<P>For their pa&s;times within doores, they have <HI>Cards,</HI> but much different from ours in the fi|gures
<PB N="203" REF="116">
made in them, and in their greater num|ber of &s;uits. Tho&s;e Cards I have often &s;een and have been more often told, that they have very good skill in that mo&s;t innocent and ingenious game we call <HI>Che&s;ts.</HI></P>

<P>Their <HI>Juglers</HI> are the cunning&s;t that ever I &s;aw, to do &s;trange things by &s;leight of hand; as in this trick I &s;hall here name, where I have ob|&s;erved them to lay down <HI>&s;cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tles</HI> or broad open wicker <HI>Basketts</HI> upon the ground, three or four one upon another, all which appeared empty, as they laid them down; but taking them up a|gain one after the other, in the bottom of them there would appear, three or four living <HI>Turtle-doves:</HI> which they would cover again with the &s;ame <HI>&s;cuttles,</HI> and to&s;&s;ing and turning them as they took them off, and up the &s;econd time, none of tho&s;e <HI>pretty creatures</HI> were to be &s;een any more.

<P>They &s;ay, that they have a curious devi&s;e to take wild fouls that u&s;e the water, into which a fellowgoes, with a foul of that kinde he de&s;ires to catch, who&s;e skin is &s;tu&s;&s;ed &s;o artificially, as that with a noy&s;e he counterfets of that foul, it appears to be alive, the man keeps all his bo|dy but head under water, on which he fa&s;tens that counterfet foul to &s;tand foreright on the top thereof, and thus comming among&s;t them, he plucks them (as they &s;ay) by their leggs un|der water at his plea&s;ure. But this I have only by tradition.</P>

<P>AND though this Countrey affords very much variety of excellent good provi&s;ions, yet the <HI>Mahometans</HI> feed not freely on any fle&s;h, but on that which is &s;trange, and forbidden (of the <HI>Hindooes</HI> diet I &s;hall &s;peak afterwards) but for the <HI>Mahometans</HI> they are a people, as I conceive, not much given to their Palate, but are very carefull of, and temperate in their diet,

as having learn'd by experience, that full bel|lyes do more oppre&s;s, than &s;trengthen the body, that too much of the Creature doth not com|fort but de&s;troy Nature. It being a tryed truth, that Gluttony reacheth, and kills tho&s;e whom &s;words cannot touch. All di&s;ea&s;es of the body for the mo&s;t part being contracted to it by &s;ur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">etts, in one kinde or other, and therefore they keep them&s;elves to a thin diet, and eat not to pamper and plea&s;e their appetite, but to &s;atisfy and &s;upport nature, which is contented with a little every where, but with le&s;s in hot Coun|treyes, where mens dige&s;tion of food is not &s;o quick and good; this being further a tried truth, that tho&s;e bodyes are mo&s;t &s;trong, active, and healthy, which are mo&s;t temperate.</P>
<P>Therefore though they have abundance of fle&s;h and foul, and have fi&s;h too, yet are they temperate in all of them. For Swines fle&s;h it is an abomination unto the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and therefore they touch it not. And for other kinde of fle&s;h, they eat very little of them alone, to make their full meals of them, for they dre&s;s no kinde of fle&s;h in great peeces, or whole joynts, nor &s;carce any of their Foules whole.</P>
<P>For boyling of fle&s;h in water, or Baking or Ro&s;ting any fle&s;h, are peeces of Cookery (if I ob&s;erved well) they know not; but they &s;tew all their fle&s;h as their Kid, and other Veni&s;on, &amp;c. cut into &s;ippets, or flices, or little parts, to

which they put Onions and Herbs and Roots, and Ginger (which they take there Green out of earth) and other Spices, with &s;ome Butter, which ingredients when as they are well pro|portioned, make a food that is exceedingly plea&s;ing to all Palates, at their fir&s;t ta&s;ting there|of mo&s;t &s;avoury meat, happily that very di&s;h which <HI>Jacob</HI> made for his Father <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> when he got the ble&s;&s;ing <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.</P>
<P>With their fle&s;h and herbs, &amp;c. they &s;ome|times &s;tew Henns and other foul cut in peeces, which is like that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call an <HI>Olio,</HI> but more tooth&s;ome.</P>
<P>But their great common &s;tanding di&s;h there is Rice, which they boyl with more art than we: for they boyl the grain &s;o as that it is full and plump and tender, but not broken in boyling: they put to it a little green Ginger, and Pepper, and Butter, and this is the ordinary way of their dre&s;&s;ing it and &s;o tis very good.</P>
<P>Sometimes they boyl peeces of fle&s;h, or Hens, and other foul cut in peeces in their Rice, which di&s;h they call <HI>Pillaw;</HI> as they order it, they make it a very excellent, and a very well-ta&s;ted food.</P>
<P>Once my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour had an enter|tainment there by <HI>A&s;aph Chan,</HI> who invited him to dinner (and this was the only re&s;pect in that kinde he ever had, while he was in <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia)</HI> That <HI>A&s;aph Chan</HI> was a man made by

<P>This <HI>A&s;aph Chan</HI> entertained my Lord Am|ba&s;&s;adour in a very &s;pacious and a very beauti|full Tent, where none of his followers be&s;ides my &s;elf, &s;aw, or ta&s;ted of that entertainment.</P>
<P>That Tent was kept full of a very plea&s;ant Perfume; in which &s;ents the King and Gran|dees there take very much delight. The floor of the Tent was fir&s;t covered all over with very rich and large Carpets, which were covered a|gain in the places where our dinner &s;tood, with other good Carpets, made of &s;tich't Leather, to pre&s;erve them which were richer; and the&s;e were covered again with pure white and fine Callico Clothes, and all the&s;e covered with ve|ry many di&s;hes of &s;ilver, but for the greater part of tho&s;e &s;ilver di&s;hes they were not larger than our large&s;t trencher-plates, the brimms of all of them gilt.</P>
<P>We &s;ate in that large Room as it were in a Triangle; The Amba&s;&s;adour on <HI>A&s;aph Chans</HI> right hand a good di&s;tance from him, and my &s;elf below; all of us on the ground, as they there all do when as they eat, with our faces looking each to the other, and every one of us had his

&s;everal me&s;s. The Amba&s;&s;adour had more di&s;hes by ten, and I le&s;s by ten, than our enter|tainer had, yet for my part I had fifty di&s;hes. They were all &s;et before us at once, and little paths left betwixt them, that our entertainers &s;ervants (for onely they waited) might come and reach them to us one after another, and &s;o they did. So that I ta&s;ted of all &s;et before me, and of mo&s;t did but ta&s;t, though all of them ta|&s;ted very well.</P>
<P>Now of the provi&s;ion it &s;elf, for our larger di&s;hes, they were filled with Rice, dre&s;&s;ed (as before de&s;cribed) And this Rice was pre&s;ented to us, &s;ome of it white, in its own proper co|lour, &s;ome of it made yellow with Saffron, and &s;ome of it was made green, and &s;ome of it put into a purple colour, but by what ingredient I know not, but this I am &s;ure, that it all ta&s;ted very well; And with Rice thus ordered &s;everal of our di&s;hes were furni&s;hed; and very many more of them with fle&s;h of &s;everal kinds, and with Hens, and with other &s;orts of foul cut in peeces, as before I ob&s;erved in <HI>their Indian Cookery.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e we had many Jellie, and Culices; Rice ground to flower, and then boyled, and after &s;weetned with Sugar-Candy and Ro&s;e-water to be eaten cold. The flower of Rice mingled with &s;weet Almonds, made as &s;mall as they could, and with &s;ome of the mo&s;t fle&s;hy

<P>And it was better a great deal, than if it had con&s;i&s;ted of full &amp; heaped up di&s;hes, &s;uch as are &s;ometimes among&s;t us provided, for great and profu&s;e entertainments.

<P>My Lord Amba&s;&s;adour ob&s;erved not that unea&s;y way of &s;itting at his meat, but in his own hou&s;e had <HI>Tables</HI> and <HI>Chayres</HI> &amp;c. &s;erved he was altogether in <HI>Plate,</HI> and had an <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and an <HI>Indian</HI> Cook to dre&s;s his dyer, which was very plentifull, and cheap likewi&s;e; &s;o that by rea&s;on of the great variety of provi&s;ions there, his weekly account for his hou&s;e-keeping came but to little.</P>

This head-cove|ring of theirs, they call a <HI>Sha&s;h,</HI> which incircles their heads many times, and doth mervailou&s;ly defend them from the violence of the Sun. And becau&s;e this covering mu&s;t needs keep their heads hot&punc; they provide for this, as well as they can, by &s;having the haire continually from off them.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Language, their Books, their Learning, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Language</HI> of this Empire, I mean the Vulgar, bears the name of it, and is called <HI>Indo&s;tan;</HI> it hath much affinitie with the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> tongues, but the <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> is a &s;moother language, and more ea&s;y to be pronounced than the other, a language which is very &s;ignificant, and &s;peaks much in few words; They write it (as we) to the right hand. It is expre&s;&s;ed by letters, which are very much different from tho&s;e <HI>Alphabets,</HI> by which the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> tongues are formed. The <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> there is &s;poken as their more quaint and Court-tongue. The <HI>Arabian</HI> is their learned language, both written backward to the left hand like the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> from whence they borrow many words, which come &s;o neer it, as that he who is a good <HI>Critick</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> may very well gue&s;s at the meaning of much in both tho&s;e languages. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> is a language, as if it con&s;i&s;ted all of <HI>Guttur all letters,</HI> (as &s;ome
<PB N="233" REF="131">
in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet are called) filling the mouth in the Pronunciation of them; for as the words in that language are full of <HI>&s;en&s;e:</HI> &s;o in their &s;peaking they are full of <HI>&s;ound.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> by which there hath been &s;o much knowledge conveyed in|to the world, they are as ignorant of them both, as if they had never been; and this may be one great rea&s;on why there is &s;o little learning among&s;t them. But for the people them&s;elves, they are men of very &s;trong rea&s;on, and will &s;peak <HI>ex re nat&acirc;,</HI> upon any offered occa&s;ion, very exceeding well; and doubtle&s;s they are a people of &s;uch &s;trong Capacities, that were there litera|ture among&s;t them, they might be the <HI>Au|thors</HI> of many excellent <HI>works;</HI> but as the ca&s;e &s;tands with them, all that is there at|tainable towards learning, is but to read and write.</P>

<P>So of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> whom they call <HI>I&s;mal,</HI> the Sacrifice of God. So of <HI>Iacob&punc;</HI> whom they call <HI>Acob</HI> the ble&s;&s;ing of God.

<P>But I'll return again to that people that I may acquaint my reader with one thing of &s;pe|ciall ob&s;ervation and tis this: That there is not one among the Mahometans (of any under|&s;tanding) which at any time mentions the name of our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> called there <HI>Hazare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ee|&s;a</HI> the <HI>Lord Chri&s;t,</HI> but he makes mention of it with <HI>high Reverence</HI> and re&s;pect.

<P>Perhaps the <HI>Socinians</HI> fir&s;t tooke that their o|pinion from the&s;e, which bids them to have e|very thing they receive as truth, to be cleered up unto them by the &s;trength of Rea&s;on, as if there were no need of the exerci&s;e of faith.</P>
<P>And truly (I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s) that to beleeve <HI>the Incarnation of the Son of God,</HI> is one of the harde&s;t and greate&s;t taskes for Faith to encoun|ter withall that God &s;hould be <HI>made a Man,</HI> that this Man Chri&s;t &s;hould be born of a Vir|gin, that <HI>Life</HI> &s;hould &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ring from <HI>Death,</HI> and that from <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Scorne, Triumph,</HI> and <HI>Victorie &s;hould come,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>And others there are among&s;t them they call religious men, who wear nothing about them but to hide their <HI>Shame,</HI> and the&s;e (like the <HI>men|dicant Fryars)</HI> beg for all they eate.

<P>And in tho&s;e former times it was the charge of Almighty God to the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> even before they were, <HI>that they &s;hould not multiply wives,</HI> Deut. 17. 17.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their burials, of their mourning for their dead, and of their &s;tately Se|pulchres and Monuments.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> it is their manner to wa&s;h the bodies of their dead before they interre them. An ancient cu&s;tom as it &s;hould &s;eem among the <HI>Jews,</HI> for it is &s;aid of <HI>Dorcas,</HI> that after &s;he was dead, they wa&s;hed her bo|dy, as a preparative to her burial, <HI>Act.</HI> 9. 37.</P>
<P>They lay up none of the bodies of their dead in their <HI>Mi&s;quits,</HI> or Churches (as before) but in &s;ome open place in a grave, which they dig very deep and wide, a Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom, like|wi&s;e to carry the bodies of their dead to bury them out of their Cities and Towns, <HI>Luke</HI> 7. 12.</P>
<P>Their mourning over their dead is mo&s;t im|moderate,
<PB N="306" REF="169">
for be&s;ides that day of general la|mentation at the end of their <HI>Ram-Jan,</HI> or Lent, (before mentioned) they houl and cry many whole dayes for their friends departed, immediately after they have left the world and after that time is pa&s;&s;ed over, many fooli&s;h wo|men, &s;o long as they &s;urvive, very often in the year, ob&s;erve &s;et dayes to renue their mourn|ing for their decea&s;ed friends, and as a people without hope, bedew the graves of their hu&s;|bands, as of other their near relations, with abundance of (&s;eemingly) affectionate tears; as if they were like tho&s;e mourning women mentioned, <HI>Jer.</HI> 9. 17. who &s;eemed to have tears at command, and therefore were hired to mourn and weep in their &s;olemne lamenta|tions.</P>
<P>And when they thus lament over their dead, they will often put this que&s;tion to their deaf and dead Carka&s;&s;es, why they would die? They having &s;uch loving wives, &s;uch loving friends, and many other comforts, as if it had been in their power to have re&s;cued them&s;elves from that mo&s;t impartial wounding hand of death.</P>
<P>Which carriage of theirs de&s;erves nothing but cen&s;ure and pity though if it be not Theatrical, we may much wonder at it, and &s;ay of it as it was &s;aid of the mourning in the floor of <HI>Atad, Gen. 50. 11. that it is a grievous mourning,</HI> or
<PB N="307" REF="169">
<HI>as the mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon <HI>in the val|ley of</HI> Megiddon, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12. 11. if we take tho&s;e lamentations onely in a literal &s;ence.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak unto this as a Chri&s;tian; cer|tainly the Apo&s;tle, <HI>who forbids immoderate mourning for friends departed,</HI> 1 &s;hef. 4. 13. imployes and allows of that mourning which is moderate.</P>
<P>To behold a great Funeral, where there are abundance of mourning garments, and no weeping eyes, is not a good &s;ight; for a man to die as <HI>Jehojakim</HI> (a very bad Son of an excel|lent good Father) of whom it was &s;adly pro|phe&s;ied, <HI>that he &s;hould die without lamentation, non plangent eum, Eheu frater, they &s;hall not la|ment for him, &s;aying, Ah my brother!</HI> his <HI>A&s;hes</HI> &s;hould not be moi&s;tned with one <HI>tear,</HI> and to be buried as <HI>Jehojakim was with the burial of an A&s;&s;e,</HI> Jer. 2. 18, 19. is very &s;ad. And doubt|le&s;&s;e it had been better for a man never to have been born, than to live unde&s;ired and to die unlamented. For a man to run a long race through the world, and to leave no token of good behinde him but to be like an Arrow &s;hot by a &s;trong arm up into the aire; wherein it flies a great circuit, yet immediately after it is fal'n, it cannot be di&s;cern'd that it was ever there, I may &s;ay of &s;uch a one, that <HI>he was born out of due time,</HI> or rather that <HI>it had been good for him if he had not been born at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="170">
But now further concerning their places of Burial, many <HI>Mahometans</HI> of the greate&s;t qua|litie in their life time provide fair Sepulchres for them&s;elves and neare&s;ts friends compa&s;&s;ing with a firm wall, a good circuit of ground near &s;ome <HI>Tank,</HI> (before &s;poken of) about which they de|light to Burie their dead, or el&s;e they clo&s;e in a place for this u&s;e, near &s;prings of water, that may make plea&s;ant fountains, near which they erect little <HI>Mi&s;quits,</HI> or Churches, &amp; near them <HI>Tombs&punc;</HI> built round, or four &s;quare, or in &s;ix, or eight &s;quares, with round vaults, or Canopies of &s;tone over head, all which are excellently well wrought, and erected upon P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">llars, or el&s;e made clo&s;e to be entered by doors every way, under which the bodies of their dead lie inter|red, the re&s;t of that ground thus circled in, they plant with fruit Trees, and further &s;et therein all their choi&s;e&s;t flowers, as if they would make <HI>Ely&s;ian fields</HI> (&s;uch as the Poets dream'd of) wherein their Souls might take repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus to bury (as it &s;hould &s;eem) was an ancient cu&s;tom, for it is written of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh King of</HI> Judah, <HI>that he was buried in the gar|den of his own hou&s;e</HI> &s;o of his Son <HI>Amon, that he was buried in that garden likewi&s;e, 2 King.</HI> 21. 18. and 26. ver&s;es, thus I <HI>&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arima|thea</HI> had his Sepulchre in his garden, and it was well placed there, that when he was in the place of his greate&s;t delight, his meditations
<PB N="309" REF="170">
might be &s;ea&s;oned with the thoughts of his death.</P>
<P>There are many goodly Monuments which are richly adorned; built (as before was ob|&s;erved) to the memory of &s;uch as they have e&s;teemed <HI>Paeres,</HI> or Saints (of whom they have a large <HI>Kalender)</HI> in which are Lamps conti|nually burning, attended by votaries, unto whom they allow Pen&s;ions for the maintaining of tho&s;e lights; and many (tran&s;ported there with wilde devotion) dayly re&s;ort to tho&s;e mo|numents, there to contemplate the happine&s;&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Paeres</HI> (as they imagine) now enjoy.</P>
<P>And certainly of all the places that Empire affords, there are none that mini&s;ter more de|light, than &s;ome of their burying places do, neither do they be&s;tow &s;o much co&s;t, nor &s;hew &s;o much skill in <HI>Architecture</HI> in any other &s;tructures, as in the&s;e.</P>
<P>Now among&s;t many very fair <HI>Piles</HI> there dedicated to the remembrance of their dead, the mo&s;t famous one is at <HI>Secandra,</HI> a Vil|lage three miles from <HI>Agra;</HI> it was begun by <HI>Achabar-&s;ha</HI> the late <HI>Mogols</HI> Father, who there lies buried, and fini&s;hed by his Son, who &s;ince was laid up be&s;ide him. The materials of that mo&s;t &s;tately Sepulchre are Marble of divers colours, the &s;tones &s;o clo&s;ely cemented together, that it appears to be but one conti|nued &s;tone, built high like a <HI>Pyramis</HI> with ma|ny

curio&s;ities about it, and a fair <HI>Mi&s;quit</HI> by it, the Garden wherein it &s;tands very large planted (as before) and compa&s;&s;ed about with a Wall of Marble, this mo&s;t &s;umptuous <HI>Pile</HI> of all the &s;tructures that va&s;t Monarchy affords, is mo&s;t admired by &s;trangers. <HI>Tom.

<P>And if we here &s;tep a&s;ide, to look into other Countreys and &s;tories, we may ob&s;erve much to this purpo&s;e, (though none that I have ever heard of like that I la&s;t named) where many, who&s;e foregoing lives, have little de&s;erved tho&s;e following remembrances, yet after death have had their bodies lodged in rich Monuments, when others of great worth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and mo&s;t de&s;erved memory have been very ob&s;curely buried.</P>

<P>ANd for the&s;e, the fir&s;t that I &s;hall take notice of, is, that they agree with others in the world, about the fir&s;t Roots of man|kinde <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and the fir&s;t of them they call <HI>Babba Adam,</HI> or <HI>Adamah,</HI> Father <HI>Adam,</HI> and the &s;econd <HI>Mamma Havah,</HI> Mo|ther <HI>Eve.</HI> And from <HI>Adam</HI> they call a man <HI>Adams.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Adam</HI> they further &s;ay, that when his wife was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit, &s;he took it and chaud it, and then &s;wallowed it down, but when her husband was &s;wallowing it, the hand of God &s;top't it in his Throat, and

from hence (they &s;ay) that every man hath there an hollow bunch which women have not.</P>
<P>The names they give to di&s;tingui&s;h one man from another are many, and among&s;t them the&s;e following are very common. As <HI>Juddo,</HI> or <HI>Midas,</HI> or <HI>Cooregee,</HI> or <HI>Hergee,</HI> and the like. <HI>Ca&s;turia</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;cotta,</HI> are Womens names among&s;t them, but whither the&s;e, as tho&s;e names they call their men, or women by, are names of &s;ignification, or onely of &s;ound I know not.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Hindooes</HI> are a very laborious, and an indu&s;trious people: the&s;e are they which till and plant the ground, and breed the Cattle, the&s;e are they which make and &s;ell tho&s;e cu|rious Manufactures, or the Cloath and &s;tuffe which this Empire affords.</P>
<P>This people marry into, and con&s;equently &s;till keep in their own <HI>Tribes, Sects, Occupa|tions,</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ions.</HI> For in&s;tance all <HI>Bramins</HI> (which are their Prie&s;ts, the Sons of all which are Prie&s;ts, likewi&s;e) are married to <HI>Bramins</HI> daughters, &s;o a Merchants &s;on marries a Mer|chants daughter, and &s;o men of &s;everal trades marry to the &s;ame trade. Thus a <HI>Coolee,</HI> (who is a tiller of the ground) marries his &s;on to a <HI>Colees</HI> daughter; and &s;o in all other profe&s;&s;ions they keep them&s;elves to their own Tribes and Trades, not mixing with any other, by which means they never advance them&s;elves higher than they were at fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="176">
They take but one wife, and of her they are not &s;o fearfull and jealous as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are of their &s;everal wives and women, for they &s;uffer their wives to go abroad whether they plea&s;e. They are married very young, about &s;ix, or &s;even years old, their Parents making Matches for them, who lay hold of every op|portunity to be&s;tow their Children, becau&s;e confin'd to their own Tribes, they have not &s;uch variety of choi&s;e as otherwi&s;e they might have&punc; and when they attain to the age of thir|teen, or fourteen, or fifteen years at the mo&s;t they bed together.</P>
<P>Their marriages are &s;olemnized (as tho&s;e of the <HI>Mahometans)</HI> with much company, and noi&s;e, but with this difference, that both the young couple ride openly on Hor&s;-back, and for the mo&s;t part they are &s;o little, that &s;ome go on their Hor&s;e &s;ides to hold them up from falling. They are bedeckt, or &s;trewed all over their Cloathing, with the choi&s;e flowers of that Countrey, fa&s;tned in order all about their Gar|ments.</P>
<P>For their habits they differ very little from the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> but are very like them civil|ly clad, but many of their women were Rings on their Toes, and therefore go bare foot. They we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r likewi&s;e broad Rings of Bra&s;&s;e, or better Metal upon their Wri&s;ts, and &s;mall of their Legs, to take of and on.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="176">
They have generally (I mean the women) the flaps, or tips of their ears boared when they are young, which holes daily extended and made wider, by things put and kept in them for that purpo&s;e, at la&s;t become &s;o large, as that they will hold Rings (hollowed on the out-&s;ide like Pullies) for their fle&s;h to re&s;t in that are as broad in their circumference, &s;ome of them (I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dare &s;ay) as little Sawcers. But though tho&s;e fa&s;hions of theirs &s;eem very &s;trange at fir&s;t &s;ight, yet they keep &s;o con&s;tantly to them, as to all their other habites without any alteration, that their general and continual wearing of them makes them to &s;eem le&s;&s;e &s;trange unto others which behold them.</P>
<P>And for their Diet very many of them (as the <HI>Banians</HI> in general (which are a very &s;trict Sect) will eat of nothing that hath had, or may have life. And the&s;e live upon Herbs, &amp; Roots, and Bread&punc; and Milk, and Butter, and Chee&s;e, and Sweet-meats, of which they have many made very good by rea&s;on of their great abun|dance of Sugar. Others among&s;t them will eat fi&s;h, but of no living thing el&s;e. The <HI>Ra&s;h|boots</HI> will eat Swines fle&s;h, which is mo&s;t hate|full to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> &s;ome will eat one kinde of fle&s;h, &s;ome of another (of all very &s;paringly) but all the <HI>Hind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">os</HI> in general ab|&s;tain from Beef, out of an high and over-excel|lent e&s;teem they have of Kine, and therefore

<P>The Widows of the&s;e <HI>Hindoos</HI> (fir&s;t men|tioned) &s;uch as have lived to keep company with their Husbands, for (as before) there is u&s;ually a good &s;pace of time 'twixt their wed|ding and bedding.

<P>A better agreement in death than that of <HI>Eteocles</HI> and <HI>Polynices,</HI> the two <HI>Theban</HI> bro|thers, of whom it is &s;aid that they were &s;uch deadly enemies while they were alive, that af|ter, when both their bodies were burnt together in the &s;ame <HI>fiery Pile,</HI> the flame parted and would not mix in one, of which <HI>Statius</HI> thus:</P>

<P>But tho&s;e, which before I named, agree &s;o well in life, that they will not be divided by death, where their flames unite together. And although the Woman, who thus burns with her Husband, doth this voluntarily, not by any compul&s;ion (for the love of every Widow there is not thus fired) and though the poor Crea|ture, who thus dies may return and live if &s;he plea&s;e, even then when &s;he comes to the <HI>Pile,</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the tenderne&s;&s;e of that people in pre|&s;erving the lives of all other infe|riour Creatures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr they will not (if they can help it by any means) take, but on the contrary do what they can to pre&s;erve the lives of all inferiour Creatures, whence (as before I told you) they give large money to pre&s;erve the lives of their <HI>Kine</HI> (a rea&s;on for this you &s;hall have after|ward) and I have often ob&s;erved, that when our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> boyes there have out of wanton|ne&s;&s;e been killing of Flies (there &s;warming in
<PB N="327" REF="179">
abundance) they would be very much troubled at it, and if they could not per&s;wade them to &s;uffer tho&s;e poor Creatures to live, they would give them mony, or &s;omething el&s;e to forbear that (as they conceived) cruelty.</P>
<P>As for them&s;elves (I mean a very great num|ber of them) they will not deprive the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;&s;e, and mo&s;t offen&s;ive Creatures of life, not <HI>Snakes,</HI> and other venomous things that may kill them, &s;aying, that it is their nature to do hurts, and they cannot help it, but as for them&s;elves they further &s;ay, that God hath gi|ven them rea&s;on to &s;hun tho&s;e Creatur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, but not liberty to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>And in order to this their conceit, the <HI>Ba|nians</HI> (who are the mo&s;t tender hearted in this ca&s;e of all that people) have <HI>Spittles</HI> (as they &s;ay) on purpo&s;e to recover lame birds &amp; bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Some ground for this their tenderne&s;&s;e hap|pily proceeds from this con&s;ideration; that they cannot give life to the meane&s;t of the &s;en&s;ible Creatures, and therefore think that they may not take the lives of any of them: for the poor|e&s;t worm, which crawleth upon the face of the earth, <HI>tam vita vivit, quam Angelus,</HI> (as one of the ancients &s;peaks) live for the pre&s;ent as much as the Angels, and cannot be willing to part with that life, and therefore they imagine that it is mo&s;t injurious by violence to take it.</P>
<P>But (as I conceive) the mo&s;t principal cau&s;e
<PB N="328" REF="180">
why they thus forbear to take the lives of in|feriour Creatures, proceeds from their obedi|ence unto a precept given them by one of their principal, and mo&s;t highly e&s;teemed Prophets and Law-givers they call <HI>Bremaw;</HI> others, they have in very high e&s;teem, and the name of one of them is <HI>Ram,</HI> of another <HI>Permi&s;&s;ar.</HI> I am ignorant of the names of others, and I con|ceive that my Reader will not much care to know them. But for him they call <HI>Bremaw,</HI> they have received (as they &s;ay) many precepts, which they are carefull to ob&s;erve, and the fir&s;t of them. This</P>
<P><HI>Thou &s;halt not kill any living Creature what|&s;oever it be, having life in the &s;ame, for thou art a Creature, and &s;o is it, thou art indued with life, and &s;o is it, thou &s;halt not therefore &s;pil the life of any of thy fellow-Creatures that live.</HI></P>
<P>Other <HI>precepts</HI> (they &s;ay) were delivered un|to them by their Law-giver about their devoti|ons, in their <HI>wa&s;hings and wor&s;hippings</HI> where they are commanded.</P>
<P><HI>To ob&s;erve times for fa&s;ting, and hours for watching, that they may be the better fitted for them.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;Other directions they have about their <HI>fe&s;tivals</HI> wherein they are required,</P>
<P><HI>To take their food moderately, in not pamper|ing their bodies.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;Concerning <HI>Charity</HI> they are further commanded.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="180">
<HI>To help the poor as far as they are po&s;&s;ibly able.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;Other precepts (they &s;ay) were given them likewi&s;e in charge; as</P>
<P><HI>Not to tell fal&s;e tales, nor to utter any thing that is untrue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to &s;teal any thing from others, be it never &s;o little.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to defraud any by their cunning in bar|gains, or contracts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to oppre&s;&s;e any, when they have power to do it.</HI></P>
<P>Now all tho&s;e particulars are ob&s;erved by them with much &s;trictne&s;&s;e; and &s;ome of them are very good, having the impre&s;&s;ion of God upon them, but that &s;cruple they make in for|bearing the lives of the Creatures made for mens u&s;e, &s;hews how that they have their dwel|ing in the dark, which makes them by rea&s;on of their blindne&s;&s;e to deny unto them&s;elves that li|berty, and <HI>Soveraignty</HI> which Almighty God hath given unto man <HI>over the bea&s;ts of the field, the fowles of the Air, and the fi&s;hes of the Sea,</HI> appointed for his food, given unto him for his <HI>&s;ervice</HI> and <HI>&s;u&s;tenance,</HI> to &s;erve him, and to &s;eed him, but not to make havock and &s;poil of them.</P>

<P>Hi&s;tories are fill'd with many inhumane, and &s;trange examples of this kinde. <HI>Valerius</HI> writes of <HI>Lucius Sylla</HI> (who&s;e cruelty and thir&s;t after bloud, made him a Mon&s;ter of mankinde, a very Prodigy of Nature) that when he had cau|&s;ed &s;ome thou&s;ands of men to be put to death, or (more properly) to be murdered in one day, he pre&s;ently gave command that this mon&s;trous fact of his &s;hould be recorded, lea&s;t the memory of &s;o honourable an action (for &s;o he call'd in) might be forgotten.</P>
<P>He kill'd a Gentleman of <HI>Rome</HI> at the &s;ame time for not enduring the &s;ight of an innocent man of quality, whom he &s;aw cau&s;ele&s;ly mur|dered.

<P>ALl error in the World proceeds either from ignorance (commonly joyned with pride) or el&s;e from wilfulne&s;&s;e. This is mo&s;t true as in natural, and moral, &s;o in &s;piritual things. For as knowledge &s;oftens &amp; &s;weetens mens manners: &s;o it enricheth their mindes:
<PB N="243" REF="187" MS="y">
which knowledge is certainly a mo&s;t divine, a very excellent thing, otherwi&s;e our fir&s;t Parents would never have been &s;o ambitious of it. This makes a man here to live twice, or to en|joy here a double life in re&s;pect of him that wants it.

<P>For there is <HI>&s;cientia contri&s;tans</HI> (as <HI>Bernard</HI> &s;peaks) a &s;ad, an unquiet, an unpeaceable, and an un&s;atisfying knowledge, as to know that there is a God, (for &s;o this people do) and to be ignorant, (as this people, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">llions more are) to &s;erve him aright, and how to make him their God. As for men to know that they are &s;in|ners, and not to know this unto amendment of life: as to know that there is an Heaven and not to know how to attain it. As to know that there is an Hell, and not to know how to avoid it.

<P>For <HI>Heathens,</HI> that have neither light nor guide to be thus divided, and to live in dark|ne&s;&s;e hath not &s;o much wonder in it, but for Chri&s;tians, who have been in the <HI>valley of vi&s;i|ons</HI> thus to &s;eparate, mini&s;ters matter of won|der, or pity, nay, of both.

<P>Both men and women before they go to their devotions (which are very frequently per|formed) wa&s;h their bodies, and keep off all their cloaths, but the covering of mode&s;ty till they have done, led hereunto by a precept (as they &s;ay) commanded them to be perform'd by their Law-giver <HI>Bremaw,</HI> which requires them dayly <HI>to ob&s;erve their times of devotion expre&s;|&s;ed by their wa&s;hings, and wor&s;hippings, &amp; prayer to God; which mu&s;t be all done with purity of hearts.</HI></P>
<P>And it is the manner of this people before they take their food to wa&s;h their bodies, then (which I much ob&s;erved while we lived in Tents) they make a little Circle upon the ground, which they &s;eem to con&s;ecrate, after which they &s;it down within that Compa&s;&s;e, and eat what they have provided; and if any come within that Circle before they have ended their meal, they pre&s;ently quit the place, and leave their food behinde them.</P>

That outward wa&s;hing (as this people think) avails very much to their clean&s;ing from &s;in, not unlike the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who were all for the out-&s;ide of Religion, and would not eat <HI>with unwa&s;hen hands,</HI> Marc. 7. 2. unle&s;&s;e they wa&s;hed them&s;elves up to the Elbows, (as <HI>Theophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">act</HI> ob&s;erves) hence tho&s;e <HI>Hindoos</HI> a&s;cribe a cer|tain Divinity unto Rivers, but above all to that Famous River <HI>Ganges,</HI> whither they flock day|ly in Troups, that there they may wa&s;h them|&s;elves; and the nearer they can come to the head of that River, the more virtue they be|lieve is in the water.

<P>And by the way, that wilde and mad phan|&s;ie of theirs, that their <HI>Zertoo&s;t</HI> did fetch fire from Heaven is as certainly true, as that ancient fiction and fable of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> that he did &s;teal fire thence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their King the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> his di&s;cent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw tho&s;e <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> I have named, live under the &s;ubjection of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> which <HI>Name,</HI> or rather <HI>Title</HI> (if my information abu&s;e me not) &s;ignifies cir|cumci&s;ed, as him&s;elf, and the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are; and therefore for his mo&s;t general title he is called the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> as the chief of the cir|cumci&s;ed, or the chief of the circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>He is lineally de&s;cended from that mo&s;t fa|mous conqueror, called in our &s;tories <HI>Tamber|lane,</HI> concerning who&s;e birth and original Hi|&s;tories much differ, and therefore I cannot de|termine it; but in this, all that write of him agree, that he having got together very many huge multitudes of men, made very great con|que&s;ts in the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> parts of the World, not onely on <HI>Bajazet</HI> the Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> but al&s;o in <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and el&s;ewhere; for what cannot force by multitudes do? This <HI>Tamberlane</HI> in their &s;tories is called <HI>Amir Timur,</HI> or the great Prince and Emperor <HI>Ti|mur,</HI> who (as they &s;ay) towards his end, either by an hurt received in his thigh, or el&s;e by an unhappy fall from his Hor&s;e, which made him

<P>And now that my Reader may &s;ee the great <HI>Mogol</HI> in a <HI>Portrature</HI> (which was taken from a Picture of his drawn to the life) I have cau&s;ed that to be here in&s;erted, which pre&s;ents him in his dayly unvaried Habite, as he is bedeckt, and adorned with Jewels, he continually wears; for the fa&s;hion of the Habite, in which he is here pre&s;ented, it is for the fa&s;hion the Habite of that whole va&s;t <HI>Empire;</HI> &s;o that he who &s;trictly views this; may &s;ee the dre&s;&s;e of the men throughout that whole great Monarchy.</P>

Here are very high titles taken by <HI>Tamber|lane</HI> and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the lower we go, the greater &s;till they are, but the la&s;t of them &s;wels bigge&s;t of all, calling him&s;elf among&s;t other phan&s;ies <HI>the Conqueror of the world,</HI> and &s;o he conceits him&s;elf to be; As they write of <HI>Thra&s;yllus</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> who believed that all the &s;hips on the Sea were his own, and there|fore he would call them, <HI>my &s;hips,</HI> when ever he &s;aw them floating on the waters; and thus the great <HI>Magol</HI> imagines all the Kings, Nations, and people of the world to be his Slaves and Va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>And therefore when the <HI>Grand Signiour,</HI> or great <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> who came unto him attended with a great train and retinue, and after when he was ready to take his leave, de&s;ired of the <HI>Mogol</HI> to know what he &s;hould &s;ay to his Ma&s;ter when he was returned; tell thy Ma&s;ter &s;aid the <HI>Mo|gol</HI> that he is my <HI>&s;lave,</HI> for my Ance&s;tor Con|quered him.</P>

<P>Now they &s;ay that one great rea&s;on, why they put men there unto &s;uch exqui&s;ite tor|ments, is, becau&s;e they hold it a thing of the greate&s;t <HI>di&s;honour</HI> there for any man to dye by the hand of an <HI>Executioner:</HI> therefore they are u&s;ually commanded, when they are &s;entenced to dye, to rip up, or cut open their own bellies, and tho&s;e who will not &s;o do are tormented in dy|ing.

<P>But to return again to the place fro~ whence I have made &s;ome excur&s;ion, when I was in <HI>India</HI> there was one &s;entenced by the <HI>Mogol</HI> him&s;elf, for killing his own father to dye thus; fir&s;t he commanded that this <HI>Paricide</HI> &s;hould be bound alive by his heels, fa&s;tned to a &s;mall iron Chain, which was tied to the hinde leg of a great Ele|phant, and then that this Elephant &s;hould drag him after him one whole remove of that King, from one place to another, which was about ten miles di&s;tant, that &s;o all his fle&s;h might be worne off his bones, and &s;o it was, when we &s;aw him in the way following that King in his progre&s;&s;e, for he appeared then to us a <HI>skeliton,</HI> rather than a body.</P>
<P>There was another condemned to dye by the <HI>Mogol</HI> him&s;elf, (while we were at <HI>Ama|davar)</HI> for killing his own Mother, and at this the King was much troubled to think of death; &s;uitable for &s;o horrid a crime, but upon a little
<PB N="381" REF="209">
pau&s;e, he adjudged him to be &s;tung to death by <HI>Snakes,</HI> which was accordingly done. I told you before that there are &s;ome <HI>Mountebanks</HI> there, which keep great <HI>Snakes</HI> to &s;hew tricks with them; one of tho&s;e fellows was pre&s;ently called for to bring his <HI>Snakes</HI> to do that exe|cution, who came to the place where that wretched Creature was appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to dye, and found him there all naked (except a little co|vering before) and trembling. Then &s;uddenly the <HI>Mountebank</HI> (having fir&s;t angred and pro|voked the venomous Creatures) put one of them to his Thigh, which pre&s;ently twin'd it &s;elf about that part, till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till bloud followed, the other was fa&s;tned to the out&s;ide of his o|ther Thigh, twining about it, (for tho&s;e <HI>Snakes</HI> thus kept are, long and &s;lender) and there bit him likewi&s;e, notwith&s;tanding, the wretch kept upon his feet nere a quarter of an hour, before which time the <HI>Snakes</HI> were taken from him; But he complained exceedingly of a fire that with much torment had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all his Limbs, and his whole body began to &s;well exceed|ingly, like <HI>Na&s;idius,</HI> bit by a <HI>Lybian</HI> Serpent, called a <HI>Pre&s;ter,</HI> of whom Mr. <HI>May</HI> in his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Lucan,</HI> the ninth Book thus writes:</P>

<L>His limbs, all parts the poy&s;on doth confound,</L>
<L>And he lies hid in his own body drown'd.</L></Q>
<P>Now much after this manner did the &s;ting|ing of tho&s;e <HI>Snakes</HI> work upon that wretch, &amp; about half an hour after they were taken from him, the Soul of that unnatural Mon&s;ter left his growing Carka&s;&s;e, and &s;o went to its place.

<P>That King never &s;uffers any of his <HI>Vicege|rents</HI> to tarry long in one place of Govern|ment,

but removes them u&s;ually (after they have exerci&s;ed that power, which was given un|to them in one place, for one year) unto &s;ome other place of Government, remote from the former, wherein they exerci&s;e their power, and this that King doth, that tho&s;e, which be his Sub&s;titutes, may not in any place grow Popu|lar.</P>
<P>I told them before that this people are very neat, &s;having them&s;elves &s;o often, as that they feel the Ra&s;or almo&s;t every day; but when that King &s;ends any of them unto any place of Go|vernment, or upon any other imployment, they cut not their hair at all, till they return again into his pre&s;ence, as if they de&s;ired not to ap|pear beautifull, or to give them&s;elves any con|tent in this while they live out of the Kings &s;ight; and therefore the King, as &s;oon as he &s;ees them, bids them cut their hair.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mogol</HI> by Letters &s;ends his com|mands to any of his Governours, tho&s;e papers are entertain'd with as much re&s;pect as if him|&s;elf were pre&s;ent; for the Governour having intelligence that &s;uch Letters are come near him, him&s;elf with other inferiour Officers ride forth to meet the <HI>Patamar,</HI> or me&s;&s;enger that brings them, and as &s;oon as he &s;ees tho&s;e Let|ters&punc; he alights from his hor&s;e, falls down on the earth, and then takes them from the me&s;&s;enger and layes them on his head, whereon he binds

them fa&s;t, and then returning to his place of publick meeting, for di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, he reads them, and an&s;wers their contents with all care and diligence.</P>
<P>The King oft times in his own per&s;on and &s;o his &s;ub&s;titutes appointed Governours for Pro|vinces and Cities, Judge in all matters Crimi|nal that concern life and death.

And tho&s;e Officers wait likewi&s;e on other Judges there, which are called <HI>Cadees,</HI> who onely meddle with Contracts and Debts, and other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of this Nature 'twixt man and man. Now the&s;e Officers arre&s;t Debtors, and bring them before tho&s;e Judges, and their &s;ureties too, bound as with us in Contracts confirmed (as before) under their hands and &s;eals, and if they give not content unto tho&s;e which complain of them, they will impri&s;on their per&s;ons, where they &s;hall finde and feel the weight of fetters; nay, many times they will &s;ell their per&s;ons, their Wives and Children into bondage, when they cannot &s;atisfie their Debts; And the cu|&s;tom

<P>And immediately after the <HI>Mogol</HI> cau&s;ed that Coach to be taken all to pieces, and to have another made by it, for (as before) they are a people that will make any new thing by a pattern, and when his new Coach was made according to the pattern, his work-men fir&s;t putting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coach together, did &s;o with that they had new made, then pulling out all the <HI>China</HI> Velvet which was in the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Coach, there was in the room thereof put a very rich Stuffe, the ground &s;ilver, wrought all over in &s;paces with variety of flowers of &s;ilk, excellently well &s;uited for their colours, and cut &s;hort like a Plu&s;h, and in &s;tead of the bra&s;&s;e Nails that were fir&s;t in it, there were Nails of &s;ilver put in their places.

<P>Of him, &s;hewing him&s;elf three times pub|lickly unto his people every day, and in what &s;tate and glory he doth oftentimes appear.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIr&s;t, early in the morning at that very time, the Sun begins to appear above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> He appears unto his people in a place very like unto one of our <HI>Balconies,</HI> made in his hou&s;es, or Pavilions for his morning ap|pearance, directly oppo&s;ite to the Ea&s;t, about &s;even, or eight foot high from the ground, a|gain&s;t which time a very great number of his people&punc; e&s;pecially of the greater &s;ort, who de|&s;ire as of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en as they can to appear in his eye, a&s;|&s;emble there together to give him the <HI>Salam,</HI> or good morning, crying all out as &s;oon as they &s;ee their King with a loud voice <HI>Pad&s;ha Sala|met,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>live &ocirc; Great King,</HI> or O great King, <HI>health and life,</HI> (as all the people cried, 1 <HI>King. 1. 39. God &s;ave King</HI> Solomon: and thus they clapped their hands for joy when <HI>Jehoa&s;h</HI> was made King, crying, <HI>God &s;ave the King,</HI> or let the King live, 2 <HI>King</HI> 11. 12.) At noon he &s;hews him&s;elf in another place like the former, on the South-&s;ide, and a little be|fore Sun-&s;et, in a like place, on the We&s;t-&s;ide
<PB N="390" REF="214">
of his hou&s;e, or Tent, but as &s;oon as the Sun for&s;akes the <HI>Hemisphear,</HI> he leaves his people u&s;hered in and out with Drums and Winde in|&s;truments, and the peoples acclamations.</P>
<P>At both which times likewi&s;e very great numbers of his people a&s;&s;emble together to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before him: And at any of the&s;e three times, he that hath a <HI>&s;uite</HI> to the King or de&s;ires Ju&s;tice at his hands, be he poor, or Rich, if he hold up a Petition to be &s;een, &s;hall be heard and an&s;wered.</P>
<P>And between &s;even and nine of the Clock at night, he &s;its within his Hou&s;e, or Tent, more privately in a &s;pacious place, called his <HI>Goozal|can,</HI> or bathing hou&s;e made bright, like day by abundance of lights, and here the King &s;its mounted upon a &s;tately <HI>Throne,</HI> where his Nobles and &s;uch as are favoured by him &s;tand about him, others finde admittance to, but by &s;pecial leave from his Guard, who cau&s;e every one that enters that place to breath upon them, and if they imagine that any have drunk wine, they keep him out.</P>
<P>At this time my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour made his u&s;ual addre&s;&s;es to him, and&punc; I often waited on him thither, and it was a good time to do bu&s;ine&s;&s;e with that King, who then was for the mo&s;t part very plea&s;ant, and full of talk unto tho&s;e which were round about him, and &s;o con|tinued till he fell a &s;leep, (oft times by drink|ing)
<PB N="391" REF="214">
and then all a&s;&s;embled immediately quit|ted the place, be&s;ides tho&s;e which were his tru|&s;ted &s;ervants, who by turns watched his Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> hath a mo&s;t &s;tately, rich and &s;pacious hou&s;e at <HI>Agrae,</HI> his <HI>Metropolis,</HI> or chief Citie, which is called his <HI>Palace Royal,</HI> wherein there are two Towers, or Turrets a|bout ten foot &s;quare covered with ma&s;&s;ie God (as ours are u&s;ualy with Lead) this I had from <HI>Tom. Coriat,</HI> as from other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, who keep in a Factory at that place. And fur|ther they told me, that he hath a mo&s;t glorious <HI>Throne</HI> within that his Palace, a&s;cended by di|vers &s;teps, which are covered with plate of <HI>&s;ilver,</HI> upon the top of which a&s;cent &s;tand four <HI>Lions</HI> upon pede&s;tals (of curiou&s;ly coloured Marble) which Lions are all made of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ie &s;ilver,</HI> &s;ome part of them guilded with Gold, and be&s;et with precious &s;tones. Tho&s;e Lions &s;upport a <HI>Canopy</HI> of pure Gold, under which the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;its, when as he appears in his greate&s;t &s;tate and glory.</P>
<P>For the <HI>beauty</HI> of that <HI>Court</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts not in gay and Gorgious apparel, for the Countrey is &s;o hot, that they cannot endure any thing that is very warm, or ma&s;&s;ie, or rich about them. The <HI>Mogol</HI> him&s;elf for the mo&s;t part is cover|ed with a garment (as before de&s;cribed) made of pure, white, and fine Callico Laune, and &s;o
<PB N="392" REF="215">
are his Nobles, which Garments are wa&s;hed after one dayes wearing. But for the <HI>Mogol,</HI> though his cloathing be not rich and co&s;tly, yet I believe that there is never a Monarch in the whole world that is dayly adorned with &s;o ma|ny Jewels as him&s;elf is. Now, they are Jewels which make mens covering mo&s;t rich, &s;uch as people in other parts &s;ometimes wear about them, that are otherwi&s;e mo&s;t meanly habited, to which purpo&s;e I was long &s;ince told by a Gentleman of honour &s;ent as a Companion to the old&punc; <HI>Earle of Nothingham,</HI> when he was imployed as an extraordinary Amba&s;&s;adour by King <HI>James,</HI> to confirm the peace made 'twixt him&s;elf and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which Amba&s;&s;adour had a very great many <HI>Gentle|men</HI> in his train, in as Rich <HI>cloathing</HI> as <HI>Velvets</HI> and <HI>Silks</HI> could make, but then there did appear many a great <HI>Don,</HI> or <HI>Grandee</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Court,</HI> in a long black bayes Cloak and Ca&s;|&s;ack, which had one <HI>Hatband of Diamonds,</HI> which was of more worth by far, than all the <HI>bravery</HI> of the Amba&s;&s;adours many <HI>followers.</HI></P>
<P>But for the <HI>Mogol</HI> I wonder not at his ma|ny Jewels, he being (as I conceive) the great|e&s;t, and riche&s;t Ma&s;ter of precious &s;tones that inhabites the whole earth. For <HI>Diamonds</HI> (which of all other are accounted mo&s;t pre|cious &s;tones) they are found in <HI>Decan</HI> (where the Rocks are, out of which they are digged)
<PB N="393" REF="215">
the Princes whereof are the next Neighbours and Tributares to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> and they pay him as Tribute many Diamonds yearly, and further, he hath the refu&s;al of all tho&s;e rich &s;tones they &s;ell, he having Gold and Sil|ver in the greate&s;t abundance, (and that will purcha&s;e any thing but heaven) and he will part with any mony for any <HI>Gems</HI> be&s;ide, that are precious and great, whither <HI>Rubies,</HI> or any other &s;tones of value, as al&s;o for rich <HI>Pearls.</HI></P>
<P>And his Grandees follow him in that phan|&s;ie, for one of his great Lords gave our Mer|chants there, twelve hundred pounds &s;terling for one Pearle, which was brought out of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The Pearle was &s;haped like a Pare, very large, beautifull, and Orient, and &s;o its price de&s;erved it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Mogol</HI> having &s;uch an abundance of Jewels, wears many of them dayly, enough to exceed tho&s;e women, which <HI>Rome</HI> was wont to &s;hew in their <HI>Starlike dre&s;&s;es,</HI> who in the height and pro&s;perity of that Empire
<Q><L>&mdash;Were &s;aid to wear</L>

<P>Or, <HI>Lollia Paulina,</HI> who was hid with Jewels. For the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> the Diamonds, and Ru|bies, and Pearls, which are very many, &amp; dayly worn by him, are all of an extraordinary great|ne&s;&s;e, and con&s;equently of an exceeding great
<PB N="394" REF="216">
value. And be&s;ides tho&s;e he wears about his <HI>Sha&s;h,</HI> or head covering, he hath a long Chain of Jewels hanging about his Neck (as long as an ordinary Gold Chain) others about his wri&s;ts, and the Hilts of his Sword and Dag|ger are mo&s;t curiou&s;ly enriched with tho&s;e pre|cious Stones, be&s;ides others of very great value, which he wears in Rings on his fingers.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>March</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI> begins a royal Fea&s;t, like that which <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> made in the third year of his Reign, <HI>E&s;th. 1. wherein he &s;hewed the riches of his glorious Kingdom.</HI> This fea&s;t the <HI>Mogol</HI> makes, is called the <HI>Noo|roos,</HI> that &s;ignifies nine dayes, which time it continues, to u&s;her in the new year, which be|gins with the <HI>Mahometans</HI> there, the tenth day of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Again&s;t which Fea&s;t, the Nobles a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together at that Court in their greate&s;t Pomp, pre&s;enting their King with great gifts, and he requiting them again with Prin|cely rewards, at which time I being in his pre|&s;ence, beheld mo&s;t immen&s;e and incredible
<PB N="395" REF="216">
riches, to my amazement, in Gold, Pearls, Pre|cious &s;tones, Jewels, and many other glittering vanities. This Fea&s;t is u&s;ually kept by the <HI>Mo|gol</HI> while he is in his Progre&s;&s;e, and lodges in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ents.</P>
<P>Whether his Diet at this time be greater than ordinary I know not, for he alwayes eats in private among his Women, where none but his own Family &s;ee him while he is eating; which Family of his con&s;i&s;ts of his Wives and Children, and Women, and Eunuchs, and his boyes, and none but the&s;e abide and lodge in the Kings hou&s;es, or Tents, and therefore how his Table is &s;pread, I could never know, but doubtle&s;&s;e he hath of all tho&s;e vanities that Em|pire affords, if he &s;o plea&s;e. His food (they &s;ay) is &s;erved in unto him in Ve&s;&s;els of Gold, which covered, and brought unto him by his Eunuchs, after it is <HI>proved</HI> by his <HI>Ta&s;ters</HI> he eats, not at any &s;et times of the day, but he hath provi&s;ion ready at all times, and calls for it when he is hungry, and never but then.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> (which was the late <HI>Mogols</HI> birth day) he retaining an ancient yearly Cu&s;tom, was in the pre&s;ence of his chief <HI>Grandies</HI> weighed in a <HI>Balance,</HI> the Ceremony performed within his Hou&s;e, or Tent, in a fair &s;pacious Room, whereinto none were admit|mitted but by &s;pecial leave. The <HI>Scales</HI> in which he was thus weighed were plated with
<PB N="396" REF="217">
Gold, and &s;o the beam on which they hung, by great <HI>Chains</HI> made likewi&s;e of that mo&s;t precious <HI>Metal,</HI> the King &s;itting in one of them was weighed fir&s;t <HI>again&s;t &s;ilver Coin,</HI> which immediately after was di&s;tributed among the <HI>poor,</HI> then was he weighed again&s;t Gold, after that again&s;t Jewels (as they &s;ay) but I ob&s;erved (being pre&s;ent there with my Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dour) that he was weighed again&s;t three &s;everal things, laid in &s;ilken <HI>Bags</HI> on the contrary Scale, when I &s;aw him in the <HI>Balance I thought on</HI> Bel&s;hazzar, <HI>who was found</HI> to light, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5. 27. By his weight (of which his Phy&s;icians yearly keep an exact account) they pre&s;ume to gue&s;&s;e of the pre&s;ent e&s;tate of his body, of which they &s;peak flatteringly, however they think it to be.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mogol</HI> is thus weighed, he ca&s;ts about among the &s;tanders by <HI>thin pieces of &s;il|ver</HI> &amp; &s;ome of Gold, made like flowers of that Countrey, and &s;ome of them are made like <HI>Cloves,</HI> and &s;ome like <HI>Nutmegs,</HI> but very thin and hollow. Then he drinks to his Nobles in his <HI>Royal wine</HI> (as that of <HI>Aha&s;uerus is called)</HI> E&s;th. 1. 7.) who pledge his health, at which &s;o|lemnity he drank to my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour, in a Cup of <HI>Gold</HI> mo&s;t curiou&s;ly <HI>enameled,</HI> and &s;et all over the out&s;ide with <HI>&s;tones</HI> (which were &s;mall Rubies, Turke&s;&s;es, and Emeralds) with a Cover, or Plate to &s;et it in, both of <HI>pure Gold,</HI>
<PB N="397" REF="217">
the brims of which plate, and the cover were <HI>enameled,</HI> and &s;et with <HI>&s;tones</HI> as the other, and all the&s;e together weighed <HI>twenty &amp; four ounces of our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>weight,,</HI> which he then gave un|to my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour, whom he ever u&s;ed with very much re&s;pect, and would moreover often ask him why he did not de&s;ire &s;ome good, and great gifts at his hands, he being a great King, and able to give it, the Amba&s;&s;adour would reply, that he came not thither to beg any thing of him, all that he de&s;ired was that his Countrey-men the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might have a free and &s;afe and peaceable trade in his Domi|nions, the <HI>Mogol</HI> would an&s;wer that he was bound in honour to afford them that, we co|ming from the furthermo&s;t parts of the world to trade there, and would often bid the Amba&s;|&s;adour to ask &s;omething for him&s;elf, who to this would an&s;wer, that if that King knew not better to give, then <HI>he</HI> knew to <HI>ask,</HI> he mu&s;t have nothing from him, upon the&s;e terms they continually both &s;tood, &s;o that in conclu&s;ion the Amba&s;&s;adour had no gift from him, but that before mentioned, be&s;ides an hor&s;e, or two, and &s;ometimes a <HI>Ve&s;t,</HI> or upper Garment made of &s;light Cloath of Gold, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> would fir&s;t put upon his own back, and then give it to the Amba&s;&s;adour. But the <HI>Mogol</HI> (if he had &s;o plea&s;ed) might have be&s;towed on him &s;ome great <HI>Princely gift,</HI> and found no
<PB N="398" REF="218">
greater mi&s;&s;e of it, than there would be of a Gla&s;&s;e of water taken out of a great Fountain; yet although the <HI>Mogol</HI> had &s;uch infinite Trea|&s;ures, yet he could finde room to &s;tore up more &s;till, the de&s;ires of a covetous heart being &s;o un&s;atiable, as that it never knows when it hath enough, being like a bottomle&s;&s;e pur&s;e that can never be fill'd, for the more it hath, the more &s;till it covets.</P>
<P>See an image hereof in <HI>Alcmaeon,</HI> who being will'd by <HI>Crae&s;us</HI> to go into his Trea&s;ure hou&s;e, and there take as much Gold as him&s;elf could carry away, provided for that purpo&s;e a long Garment that was double down to his <HI>ankles,</HI> and great <HI>bootes,</HI> and fill'd them both; nay, he &s;tuffed his <HI>mouth,</HI> and tied wedges of Gold to the <HI>locks</HI> of his <HI>head,</HI> and doubtle&s;&s;e, but for killing him&s;elf, he would have fill'd his <HI>skull</HI> &amp; <HI>bowels</HI> therewith. Here was an <HI>heart</HI> &s;et upon Gold, and Gold over-lading an heart, for the Man &s;towing &s;o much about him, as that he could not &s;tir with it, forfeited what he might have had, and was turned out of the Trea|&s;ury, as poor and empty as he came into it. He is a <HI>rich</HI> man whatever he hath (be it more, or le&s;&s;e) that is <HI>contented.</HI> He is a <HI>poor</HI> man, who &s;till wants more, in becoming poor by plenty, wanting what he hath, as well, as much, as what he hath not, and &s;o do very many, who are the greate&s;t engro&s;&s;ers of the worlds wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="218">
But certainly there is no heart more poor and barren than that which is &s;et upon abun|dance, and as a the ground wherein there are <HI>Mines</HI> of Gold and Silver, and the mo&s;t pre|cious Stones is mo&s;t <HI>barren;</HI> &s;o the <HI>hearts</HI> of &s;uch as are mo&s;t violently carried on after the de&s;ire of the&s;e things are mo&s;t <HI>barren likewi&s;e.</HI> Therfore almighty God in wi&s;dom hath laid up Trea&s;ures in the bowels of the earth <HI>&s;ecretly,</HI> and <HI>ba&s;ely, &s;ecretly</HI> that they &s;hould not be to much <HI>&s;ought after,</HI> and <HI>ba&s;ely,</HI> that they &s;hould not be too much <HI>de&s;ired</HI> nor valued.

<P>As &s;ometimes he delighted him&s;elf in &s;eeing <HI>Hor&s;es ridden,</HI> the Natives there (as before) being very excellent in their well managing of them.

<P>And it happened that (but a few years be|fore our abode there) a <HI>Juggler</HI> of <HI>Bengala</HI> (a Kingdom famous for Witches, and men of that profe&s;&s;ion) brought an <HI>Ape</HI> before the King (who was ever greedy to plea&s;e him&s;elf with Novelties) profe&s;&s;ing that he would do many &s;trange feats, the <HI>Mogol</HI> was ready pre&s;ently to make a trial of this, and forthwith called &s;ome <HI>boyes</HI> about him (which he was conceived to keep for &s;uch a u&s;e as I dare not name,) &amp; pluc|king a Ring from his finger gave it one of them to hide, that he might make a trial whither, or no the Ape could finde it out; who pre&s;ently went to the boy that had it.

a rea&s;on for this, was an&s;wered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there, he was bid to &s;earch for it, and then putting out tho&s;e <HI>eleven names</HI> one after the other, in a &s;eeming indignation <HI>rent them,</HI> then running to <HI>Mahobet-Chan</HI> caught him by the hand where the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>concealed,</HI> which de|livered, he opened the <HI>Scrolle,</HI> and &s;o held it up to the <HI>King,</HI> but did not tear it as the former, upon which the <HI>Mogol</HI> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Pen&s;ion for to keep him near about him, calling him the <HI>Divining Ape,</HI> and this was all that followed upon this admirable thing, except the great wonder and amazement of that people.</P>
<P>There was one &s;ome years &s;ince wrote this &s;tory (but &s;omewhat varied from that I have here related) in a little printed Pamphlet, and told his Reader that I had often &s;een that Ape while I lived in tho&s;e parts, which particular he &s;hould have left out; but for the Relation it &s;elf, I believe it was &s;o, becau&s;e it hath been often confirmed there in its report unto me by divers <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> who knew not one another, and were differing in Religion, yet all agreed in the <HI>&s;tory,</HI> and in all the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> thereof.</P>

<P>In the &s;acred &s;torie <HI>Pharoah</HI> had no &s;ooner asked, who is the Lord? <HI>Ex.</HI> 5. but pre&s;ently &s;ome of the weake&s;t of the Creatures ri&s;e up, and appear (as it were in Arms) to tell him, who the Lord was; &s;o that he who formerly thought that there was no power, either in hea|ven, or earth, to ma&s;ter, or contradict him, is pre&s;ently confuted, and conquered by <HI>Frogs,</HI> and <HI>Flies,</HI> and <HI>Lice,</HI> and <HI>Caterpillars,</HI> by tho&s;e poor, infirm, &s;illy, and mo&s;t de&s;picable <HI>Crea|tures,</HI> who when they had entred the li&s;ts, would not give proud <HI>Pharoah</HI> over, till they had humbled him, and magnified their maker, <HI>virtus Dei in infirmitate.

<P>For his cruelties, he put one of his women to a mi&s;erable death, one of his women he had formerly touched and kept Company withall, but now &s;he was &s;uperannuated, for neither him&s;elf nor Nobles (as they &s;ay) come near

Ah my head, my head!</HI> which horrid execution, or ra|ther murder was acted near our hou&s;e, where the Eunuch by the command of the &s;aid King was brought very near the place where this poor Creature was thus buried alive, and there in her &s;ight <HI>cut all into pieces.</HI></P>
<P>That great King would be often overcome by Wine, yet (as if he meant to appropriate that &s;in to him&s;elf) would puni&s;h others with very much &s;everity, who were thus di&s;tempered.</P>

<P>Sometimes for little, or no faults, the <HI>Mogol</HI> would cau&s;e men to be mo&s;t &s;everely whip't, till they were almo&s;t ready to dye under the rod, which after they mu&s;t ki&s;&s;e in thankful|ne&s;&s;e.</P>

<P>Sometimes in other of his mad di&s;tempers he would condemne men to <HI>&s;ervitude,</HI> or <HI>di&s;mem|ber,</HI> or el&s;e put them to death, as &s;acrifices to his will and pa&s;&s;ion, not Ju&s;tice.

<P>And he would &s;peak mo&s;t re&s;pectively of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Chri&s;t, but his Parentage, his poverty, and his cro&s;&s;e did &s;o confound his thoughts, that he knew not what to think of them.

<P>Of the exceeding great Pen&s;ions the <HI>Mogol</HI> gives unto his Subjects, how they are rai&s;ed, and how long they are continued, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHich great revenues that many of them do enjoy, makes them to live like great Princes rather than other men. Now for tho&s;e Pen&s;ions, which are &s;o exceeding great, the <HI>Mogol</HI> in his far extend|ed Monarchy allowes yearly pay for <HI>one Mil|lion of hor&s;e,</HI> and for every hor&s;e and man about eighteen pounds &s;terling <HI>per annum,</HI> which is exactly paid every year, rai&s;ed from Land, and other Commodities which that Empire affords
<PB N="411" REF="224">
and appointed for that purpo&s;e. Now &s;ome of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s mo&s;t beloved Nobles have the pay of <HI>&s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e;</HI> and there are others (at the lea&s;t twenty in his Empire) which have the pay of 5000. hor&s;e, exceeding large Pen|&s;ions above the <HI>revenue</HI> of any other Subjects in the whole World, they amounting unto more than <HI>one hundred thou&s;and pounds</HI> yearly unto a <HI>particular man.</HI> Now others have the pay of <HI>four thou&s;and hor&s;e;</HI> others of three, or two, or one thou&s;and hor&s;e, and &s;o downward, and the&s;e by their proportions, are appointed to have hor&s;es alwayes in readine&s;&s;e well mann'd and otherwi&s;e appointed for the Kings &s;ervice, &s;o that he who hath the pay of five, or &s;ix thou|&s;and, mu&s;t alwayes have one thou&s;and in rea|dine&s;&s;e, or more, according to the Kings need of them, and &s;o in proportion all the re&s;t which enables them on a &s;udden to make up the num|ber, at the lea&s;t of <HI>two hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e,</HI> of which number, they have alwayes at hand one hundred thou&s;and to wait upon the King where&s;oever he is.</P>
<P>There are very many private men in Cities and Towns, who are Merchants, or Trade&s;|men that are very rich, but it is not &s;afe for them that are &s;o, &s;o to appear, lea&s;t that they &s;hould be u&s;ed as <HI>fill'd &s;ponges.</HI></P>
<P>But there is never a Subject in that Empire, who hath <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>inheritance,</HI> which he may
<PB N="412" REF="225">
call his own, but they are all Tenants at the will of their King, having no other <HI>title</HI> to that they enjoy be&s;ides the Kings favour, which is by far more ea&s;ily lo&s;t than gotten; It is true that the King advanceth many there, unto ma|ny great honours, and allows them as before, marvelous great revenues, but no Son there en|joyes either the Titles, or means of his Father that hath had Pen&s;ions from that King, for the King takes <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all</HI> when they are dead, appointing their Children &s;ome competent means for their <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;tence,</HI> which they &s;hall not <HI>exceed,</HI> if they fall not into the Kings affe|ction as their Fathers did, wherefore many great men in this Empire live up to the height of their means, and therefore have a very nume|rous train, a very great retinue to attend upon them, which makes them to appear like Prin|ces, rather than &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Yet this their nece&s;&s;ary dependance on their King binds them unto &s;uch ba&s;e &s;ubjection, as that they will yield with readine&s;&s;e unto any of his unrea&s;onable and wilfull commands. As <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes of the Souldiers of <HI>Scipio, nullu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;t horum, qui non con&s;cens&acirc; turri &s;emet in mare praecipitaturus, &s;i ju&s;&s;ero,</HI> that there was never a one in his Army, by his own report, that would not for a word of his mouth, have gone up into a Tower, and ca&s;t him&s;elf thence head-long into the Sea, and thus the people here will do

<HI>thing the King commands them to do;</HI> &s;o that if he bid the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">her to lay hands of violence upon his Son, or the Son upon his Father, they will do it, rather than the will of their King &s;hould be di&s;obeyed. Thus forgetting Nature, rather than Subjection.</P>
<P>And this tye of theirs (I &s;ay) upon the Kings favour makes all his Subjects mo&s;t &s;ervile flat|terers, for they will commend any of his actions, though they be nothing but cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lty, &s;o any of his &s;peeches, though nothing but folly. And when the King &s;its and &s;peaks to any of his people publickly, there is not a word falls from him that is not written by &s;ome Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">veners, or Scribes that &s;tand round about him.</P>
<P>In the year 1618. when we lived at that Court, there appeared at once in the Moneth of <HI>November</HI> in their <HI>Hemi&s;phear</HI> two great <HI>Blazing-&s;tars,</HI> the one of them, <HI>North,</HI> the other <HI>South,</HI> which unu&s;ual &s;ight appeared there for the &s;pace of one Moneth.

<P>In the mean time, take one admirable ex|ample of a very gro&s;&s;e flatterer, but a great fa|vourite of that King, who was noted above o|thers of that Nation to be a great neglecter of God, believing it Religion enough to plea&s;e the <HI>Mogol</HI> his Ma&s;ter.

<P>Of the <HI>Mogols</HI> wives and women; where &s;omething of his Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHom I conceive to be Women of good feature, though for their colour very &s;wart, which that people may call beauty, it being the complexion of them all, as the <HI>Crow</HI> thinks his bird faire&s;t, but (as before) I never ob&s;erved any crooked, or deform'd per|&s;on of either &s;ex among&s;t them: For the hone&s;ty of tho&s;e great mens Wives and Women, there is &s;uch a quick eye of jealou&s;ie continually over them, that they are made &s;o by force, though (as they &s;ay) they are never much regarded by tho&s;e great ones after the very fir&s;t, and prime of their youth is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>For that great Monarch the <HI>Mogol</HI> in the choi&s;e of his Wives and Women, he was guided more by his eye and fan&s;ie, than by any re|&s;pect had to his honour, for he took not the daughters of neighbouring Princes, but of his own &s;ubjects, and there preferr'd that, which he looked upon as beauty, before any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="232">
He was married to four Wives, and had Con|cubines, and Women be&s;ide (all which were at his command) enough to make up their num|ber a full thou&s;and (as they there confidently affirm'd.) And that he might rai&s;e up, his bea&s;t|ly and unnatural lu&s;ts, even to the very height, he kept boyes as before <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>His mo&s;t beloved wife (when I lived at his Court) he called <HI>Noor-Mahal,</HI> which &s;ignified the <HI>light of the Court,</HI> and to the other of his Wives, and Women, which he mo&s;t loved, he gave new names unto them, and &s;uch names as he mo&s;t fancied.</P>
<P>For his Wife I fir&s;t named, he took her out of the du&s;t, from a very mean family, but how|ever, &s;he made &s;uch a through conque&s;t on his affections, that &s;he engro&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all his love, did what &s;he plea&s;ed in the Government of that Empire, where &s;he advanced her brother <HI>A&s;aph-Chan;</HI> and other her neare&s;t relations, to the greate&s;t places of Command and Ho|nour, and profit in that va&s;t Monarchy.</P>
<P>Her brother <HI>A&s;aph-Chan</HI> was pre&s;ently made one of the <HI>Starres</HI> of the fir&s;t <HI>Magnitude</HI> that &s;hined in that <HI>Indian Court,</HI> and when he had once gotten, &s;o kept the <HI>Mogols</HI> favour by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Noor-Mahal,</HI> that by the Pen&s;ions given, and many Offices be&s;towed on him, he heaped up a Ma&s;&s;e of Trea&s;ure above all belief (as before) and married his daughter un|to <HI>Sultan Caroom,</HI> who is now King.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="233">
The <HI>Mogol</HI> of all his &s;o many Wives and Concubines had but <HI>&s;ix</HI> Children, five Sons and one Daughter. The names he gave his Chil|dren, and others were names that proceeded from Coun&s;el (as he imagined) rather than chance. His elde&s;t Son was called <HI>Sultan Coob|&s;urroo,</HI> which &s;ignified the Prince with the <HI>good face,</HI> his per&s;on and beauty an&s;wered his name, for he was a Prince of a very lovely pre&s;ence. His &s;econd Son he called <HI>Sultan Perum,</HI> Prince of the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> or <HI>of the &s;weet influences of the</HI> Pleiades. His third Son (now King) though that great dignity was never intended to him by his Father, was called <HI>Sultan Caroom,</HI> or the Prince of bounty. His fourth <HI>Sultan Sha|har,</HI> or the Prince of <HI>fame.</HI> His fift, and la&s;t Son was called by him <HI>Sultan Tauct, Tauct</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> tongue, &s;ignifies a <HI>Throne,</HI> and he was named &s;o by the King his Father, becau&s;e the fir&s;t hour he &s;at peaceably on his Throne, there was news brought him of that Sons birth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Son of that King, which he hath by any of his <HI>married wives,</HI> by prerogative of birth, inherits that <HI>Empire,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of every man (as before) called there <HI>(the great brother.)</HI> And he that inherits that Monarchy, doth not openly &s;laughter his younger brothers, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do; yet it is ob&s;erved, that few younger brothers of tho&s;e <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> Kings have long <HI>&s;urvived</HI> their <HI>Fathers.</HI></P>

be <HI>impaled,</HI> or put upon <HI>Stakes</HI> (that mo&s;t cruell and tormenting death) eight hundred in two &s;everall ranks in one day, without the City <HI>Lahore,</HI> and then carried his Son mo&s;t di&s;gracefully through them, <HI>bidding him to behold the men in whom he tru&s;ted.</HI> His Son told him that he &s;hould have &s;erv'd him &s;o, and &s;pared the other, who did nothing in that a|ction but upon his command; his Father re|plyed that he could &s;erve him &s;o pre&s;ently if he &s;o plea&s;ed) his Son, wild and de&s;ired him &s;o to do, telling his Father that he had no joy at all to live, after the beholding of &s;o many gal|lant men dead. Notwitha&s;tanding, the King &s;pared his life, ca&s;ting him into Pri&s;on where his eyes were &s;ealed up (by &s;omething put be|fore them which might not be taken of) for the &s;pace of three years, after what time that &s;eal was taken away, that he might with freedom enjoy the Light, though not his Liberty. And after his Father had taken him out of Pri&s;on, he kept him alwaies near about him, but with a very &s;trong guard upon him, &s;o that he fol|lowing the King his Father in his Progre&s;&s;es, we &s;ometimes &s;aw him. And once he called my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour to him as we pa&s;&s;ed by him, asking him many que&s;tions, as how far di&s;tant our Country was from them, and what we brought thither, and what we carried thence, and how the King his Father had u|&s;ed
<PB N="432" REF="235">
him &s;ince his arrive there, whither or no he had not be&s;towed upon him &s;ome great gifts. The Amba&s;&s;adour told him that his bu&s;ine&s;s there was to obtain a free trade for his Nation the Engli&s;h, and that being granted him, he had reward enough. The Prince replyed that this could not be denyed us, we coming &s;o far to trade there with him; and the Prince further asked him how long he had been there, the Amba&s;&s;adour told him about two years, the Prince replyed again, that it was a very great &s;hame for the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of <HI>Tamberlane,</HI> who had &s;uch infinite Rules, to &s;uffer a man of his quality to come &s;o far unto him, and to live &s;o long about him, and not to give him &s;ome Royall gift; and he further added that for him&s;elf he was a Pri&s;oner, and therefore could do him no good but he would pray for him, and &s;o he departed.</P>
<P>For that Prince, he was a Gentleman of a very lovely pre&s;ence and fine carriage, &s;o excee|dingly beloved of the common people, that as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tonius</HI> writes of <HI>Titus,</HI> he was <HI>Amor &amp; Deliciae,</HI> &amp;c. the very love and delight of them. Aged then about thirty and five years. He was a man who contented him&s;elf with one wife, which with all love and care accompanied him in all his &s;treights, and therefore he would never take any wife but her &s;elf, though the liberty of his Religion did admit of Plurality.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="235">
It was generally beleeved to be the intent of his Father (for he would often pre&s;age &s;o) to make this Prince his fir&s;t-born his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though for the pre&s;ent out of &s;ome jealou&s;ie (his being &s;o much beloved of the people) he de|nyed his liberty.</P>

<P>Of the Je&s;uits &s;ent thither by their Su|periors to convert people unto Chri|&s;tianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN that Empire all Religions are tolerated, which make the Tyrannicall Government there more ea&s;y to be endured. The <HI>Mogol</HI> would &s;peak well of all of them, &s;aying that a man might be happy, and &s;afe in the profe&s;|&s;ion of any Religion, and therefore would &s;ay that the Mahometan Religion was good, &s;o the Chri&s;tian Religion good, and the re&s;t good; and therefore by the way,</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts or Mini&s;ters of any Religion find regard and e&s;teem among&s;t the people. I &s;hall &s;peak &s;omething to this from my own particu|lar u&s;age there, then very young, while I lived in tho&s;e parts; yet when I was fir&s;t there brought into the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> immediatly after my arrive at his Court, I &s;tanding near the Amba&s;&s;adour (for no man there of the greate&s;t quality what&s;oever, is at any time &s;uf|fered
<PB N="441" REF="239">
to &s;it in his pre&s;ence) and but a little di|&s;tance from that King in his <HI>Goz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">lca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> he &s;ent one of his Grandees to me, to let me know, that the King bad me welcome thither, that I &s;hould have a free acce&s;s to him when ever I plea&s;ed, and if I would ask him any thing, he would give it me (though I never did ask, nor he give) and very many times afterward (when waiting upon my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour) I ap|peared before him, he would &s;till &s;hew tokens of Civility and re&s;pect unto me, and I never went abroad among&s;t that people; but tho&s;e that met me upon this con&s;ideration, that I was a <HI>Padrae</HI> (for &s;o they call'd me) a Father or Mini&s;ter, they would manife&s;t in their be|haviour towards me much e&s;teem unto me. But for the Je&s;uits there.</P>
<P>There was one of that order in <HI>Goa</HI> (a City of the Portugals lying in the skirts of India) of very much fame and renown called <HI>Jerony|mo Xauere,</HI> &s;ent for by <HI>Achabar Sha</HI> the late Kings Father in the year 1596. to argue be|fore him the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, there being alwaies pre&s;ent a <HI>Moolaa</HI> or Mahome|tan Prie&s;t, and a third per&s;on, who followed no preci&s;e rule, but what the light of nature meerly led him to, and the&s;e two were to ob|ject what they could again&s;t his rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uit in the <HI>Mogols</HI> own language (which was a great advantage to him) began
<PB N="443" REF="240">
to &s;peak fir&s;t of the Creation, and then of the fall of man, in which the Mahometans agree with us.</P>
<P>Then he layd down divers grounds to bot|tom his rea&s;onings on.</P>
<P>That man by Creation was made a mo&s;t excellent Creature, indued with the light of rea&s;on, which no other &s;ublunary Creature be|&s;ides him&s;elf had; then</P>
<P>That man thus endued, mu&s;t have &s;ome rule or Law to walk by, which he could not pre&s;cribe unto him&s;elf, and therefore it mu&s;t be given him from above.</P>
<P>That this Law was fir&s;t given unto man from God, and afterward confirmed by Pro|phets &s;ent into the world, in divers ages from God.</P>
<P>That this Law thus delivered mu&s;t needs be one Law, in all things agreeing in it &s;elf. And &s;o did not the Law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>That this thus delivered was mo&s;t confor|mable to right rea&s;on; And &s;o was not the Law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>That man fall'n from God by Sin was not able to recover him&s;elf from that fall, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be one, more than a man to do it for him, and that that one could not be Mahomet.</P>
<P>That this one was, Chri&s;t God, as well as man, God to &s;atisfie (the Mahometans them|&s;elves
<PB N="442" REF="240">
confe&s;&s;ing that Chri&s;t was the breath of God) and man to &s;uffer death as he did.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;t the Son of God coming into the world, about that great work of &s;atisfy|ing Gods anger again&s;t man for &s;in, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould live a poor and labori|ous life here on Earth (at which the Maho|metans much &s;tumble) and not a life that was full of pomp, and plea&s;ure, and delicacie.</P>
<P>That the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and other holy Books of Scripture, which the Chri&s;tians re|tain and walk by, contain nothing in them that is corrupt and depraved; But there is very much to be found in their Alcaron which is &s;o.</P>
<P>That the great worth and worthine&s;s &s;hining in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, was by far more ex|cellent than any thing ob&s;ervable in Mahomet (for they them&s;elves confe&s;s that Chri&s;t lived without &s;in, when Mahomet him&s;elf acknow|ledgeth, that he had been a filthy per&s;on.)</P>
<P>That the feigned and fooli&s;h, and ridicu|lous miracles, which they &s;ay were done by Mahomet, were nothing comparable to the miracles done by Chri&s;t, who (as the Maho|metans confe&s;s) did greater miracles than ever were done before or &s;ince him.</P>
<P>That there was a great deal of difference in the manner of promulgating the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, into the world, and the introducing of the Laws of Mahomet.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="241">
That Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed Heaven for all that beleeve in him, and that Hell is prepared for all others that do not rely on him, and on him alone for Salvation.</P>
<P>There were many more particulars be&s;ides the&s;e, which that <HI>Jeronymo Xaucere</HI> laid down before the <HI>Mogol</HI> to ground his arguments on, which that King heard patiently at &s;everall times during the &s;pace of one year and half, but at la&s;t he &s;ent him away back again to <HI>Goa</HI> honourably, with &s;ome good gifts be|&s;towed on him, telling him as <HI>Felix</HI> did, after he had rea&s;oned before him, <HI>that he would call for him again when he had a convenient time,</HI> Acts 24. 25. Which time or &s;ea&s;on neither of them both ever found afterward.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars which I have here in&s;er|ted (with many more I might have added to them, upon all which that <HI>Jeronymo Xaucere</HI> enlarged him&s;elf before the <HI>Mogol</HI> in his ar|guings before him) were given unto me in La|tine by <HI>Franci&s;co Cor&s;i,</HI> another Je&s;uit re&s;ident at that Court, while I was there, and long be|fore that time. And further I have been there told b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> other people profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity in that Empire, that there was &s;uch a di&s;pute there held, and for my part do beleeve it.</P>
<P>For that <HI>Franci&s;co Cor&s;i</HI> he was a <HI>Floren|tine</HI> by birth, aged about fifty years, who (if he were indeed what he &s;eemed to be) was a
<PB N="445" REF="241">
man of a &s;evere life, yet of a fair and an affa|ble di&s;po&s;ition: He lived at that Court, as an Agent for the Portugals, and had not onely free acce&s;s unto that King, but al&s;o encourage|ment and help by gifts, which he &s;ometimes be&s;towed on him.</P>
<P>When this Je&s;uit came fir&s;t to be acquain|ted with my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour, he told him that they were both by profe&s;&s;ion Chri&s;tians, though there was a va&s;t difference betwixt them in their profe&s;&s;ing of it. And as he &s;hould not go about to reconcile the Amba&s;&s;adour to them: So he told him that it would be labour in vain if he &s;hould attempt to reconcile him to us. Onely he de&s;ired, that there might be a fair corre&s;pondency betwixt them, but no di&s;|putes. And further his de&s;ire was that tho&s;e wide differences 'twixt the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> and us might not be made there to appear, that Chri&s;t might not &s;eem by tho&s;e differences to be di|vided among&s;t men profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, which might be a very main ob&s;tacle, and hin|derance unto his great de&s;ign and endeavour, for which he was &s;ent thither, to convent peo|ple unto Chri&s;tianity there. Telling my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour further, that he &s;hould be ready to do for him all good offices of love and &s;er|vice there, and &s;o he was.</P>
<P>After his fir&s;t acquaintance, he vi&s;ited us often, u&s;ually once a week. And as tho&s;e of
<PB N="446" REF="242">
that &s;ociety, in other parts of the world are ve|ry great intelligencers: &s;o was he there know|ing all news which was &s;tirring and might be had, which he communicated unto us.</P>
<P>And he would tell us many &s;tories be&s;ide, one of which, if true, is very remarkeable. And it was thus; there are a race of people in Ea&s;t India, the men of which race have (if he told us true) their right legges extraordinary great and mi&s;hapen, their left legges are like other mens. Now he told us, that they were the po|&s;terity of tho&s;e who &s;tamped St. <HI>Thomas the Apo&s;tle to death,</HI> come thither to Preach the Go&s;pel, and that ever &s;ince the men of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> race have, and onely they of that Nation, that great deformity upon them. Some few people I have there &s;een of whom this &s;tory is told, but whither that deformity be like <HI>Gehiza</HI>'s lepro&s;ie, hereditary, and if &s;o, whither it fell upon that people upon the occa&s;ion before na|med, I am yet to learn.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits in Ea&s;t-India (for he was not alone there) have liberty to convert, any they can work upon, unto Chri&s;tianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath thus far declared, that it &s;hall be lawfull for any one, per&s;waded &s;o in con&s;cience, to become a Chri&s;tian, and that he &s;hould not by &s;o doing lo&s;e his favour.</P>
<P>Upon which, I have one thing, here to in|&s;ert, which I had there by report (yet I was bid

The Je&s;uit not willing to put him&s;elf upon &s;o &s;uddain and &s;o hot a tryall, an&s;wered that he dur&s;t not tempt God, who was not tyed to times, and it might be that Almighty God, would never &s;hew that people that infinite favour to make them Chri&s;tians, or if he had &s;uch a great mercy for them in &s;tore, it might be that the time of manife&s;ting it was not yet come, and therefore if he &s;hould now &s;ubmit to that tryall, and Almighty God not plea&s;e to &s;hew a further and a pre&s;ent mi|racle, his Religion would &s;uffer prejudice there for ever after and therefore he refu&s;ed.</P>

<P>A third (and that &s;hall be la&s;t cau&s;e I will name of &s;o much increa&s;e of wickedne&s;s in this Nation, and becau&s;e it is &s;o de&s;tructive and mi&s;chievous, I &s;hall &s;peak more largely to it) is the great carele&s;ne&s;s of Parents in their not looking to their Children in their fir&s;t in&s;titution and breeding; for without all doubt the very &s;ad mi&s;carriages of all &s;orts of Children, of higher and meaner ex|traction or de&s;cent, proceed very much from their fir&s;t ordering; when many Parents quite undoe their Children, <HI>&s;tulto &amp; impro|bo amore;</HI> by rea&s;on of their fooli&s;h indul|gence, the great &s;in of <HI>Eli</HI> (before &s;poken of) who brought up his Sons to bring down his hou&s;e; who, for giving them their way too much, was &s;aid, <HI>to honour his Sons more than God.</HI> So <HI>David</HI> after him was ob&s;er|ved over much to indulge his Son <HI>Ab&s;olon,</HI> when he was young, and to requite him for this ill breeding, <HI>Ab&s;olon</HI> lives heavily to vex his Father <HI>Davia</HI> when his Father was old.</P>
<P>The Children of many Parents (e&s;pecially of great ones) bred when they are young at

<P>I do not deny but that there may be ve|ry many good experiences gaind by travell, but very few do, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e, which do not improve that advantage: whence it often comes to pa&s;s, when a great number of the&s;e come to write them&s;elves men, be|ing unable to read Books for want of tho&s;e principles of learning they might have got|ten; and unwilling to &s;ettle them&s;elves in other good imployments, whereby they might be enabled to give a fair account of their precious time, they often learn to drink, and &s;wear, and rant, and game, and Court Women (to &s;peak it in the mode|&s;te&s;t &s;en&s;e) or to &s;poyl good Clothes, they re&s;olving to enjoy the plea&s;ures that are pre&s;ent, as if they had been born to no other end but to &s;it down, <HI>and to eat and drink, and to ri&s;e up to play.</HI></P>

<P>Of all the Ages of men there is no time of life whereon we may ground more hope, and more fear than in Child-hood and youth.

<P>That dangerous time of youth, by the envy, and cunning, and help of Satan, car|ries very many young men left too much unto them&s;elves into mo&s;t &s;hameful cour&s;es, They being of them&s;elves like a Ship on the maine Ocean, that hath neither Helm, nor compa&s;s, and therefore moves it knows not whither.

<P>Yet many think that in that time of life, their youth gives them &s;ome liberty and priviledge, <HI>aliquid aetati juvenum e&s;t conce|dendum,</HI> they &s;ay, which words abu&s;ed, make them the Divels di&s;pen&s;ation, and not Gods; though they may fondly and fal&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e, that becau&s;e they are young, they may be borne withall in any thing they do, as if Pride, Drunkenne&s;s, Whoredome, and the like mo&s;t fearfull exorbitances, were not faults in youth, they not con&s;idering that want of years and want of judgement (which judgement enables to put a right difference 'twixt good and evill) u&s;ually go together. And that youth is like unto green wood, which is ever &s;hrinking and warping; for <HI>as with the antient there is wi&s;dom,</HI> Job. 12. 12. &s;o pampered and ungoverned youth is com|monly ra&s;h, heady, in&s;olent, wedded to its own will, led by humour, a rebell to rea|&s;on, a &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ion, fitter to execute than to advi&s;e: and becau&s;e youth cannot con&s;ider, as it &s;hould, it is no marvell if it &s;o often mi&s;carry.

<P>But (which is a very great hinderance unto many young men, when they do but begin to enter upon their way) there are many Parents which do not de&s;ire, that their Children &s;hould be good betimes, they be|ing mi&s;led by one of the Devils Proverbs, which is <HI>a young Saint an old Devill.</HI> It is true, that &s;ome, who have been wild and wicked in youth, have proved good in age: But it is a mo&s;t tryed truth, to encourage the groth of early holine&s;s, which hath been made good by much experience, that <HI>a Saint in youth, an Angell in age.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Veritatem Philo&s;ophia quaerit, Theologi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> invenit, Religio po&s;&s;idet,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Mirandula.</HI> Phi|lo&s;ophy &s;eeks truth, Divinity finds it, but Religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth it not the face or mask, or vi&s;ard, or forme, but the truth and pow|er of Religion, of which &s;omething by the way.</P>
<P>The truth, and power of Religion, I &s;ay, for there have been ever many mi&s;concei|vings about Religion. How many &s;tirs, and quarrels, and Heats have we known about the li&s;t, and fringe of Chri&s;ts Garment, (as one of mo&s;t high de&s;erving long &s;ince ob&s;er|ved) and the&s;e mi&s;takes in Religion have made many to agree no better than the Bricklayers of <HI>Babel,</HI> who when their tongues were divided could not under&s;tand one anothers &s;peech, but did mi&s;take one thing for another; And thus do many now who take nature (if but a little refined) for Grace; Will for Con&s;cience. So a floa|ting knowledge for true wi&s;dom, cruelty for Ju&s;tice, covetou&s;ne&s;s for frugality, ba&s;e|ne&s;s for humility, pre&s;umption for hope, a
<PB N="539" REF="288">
di&s;tempered heat for true zeal, and vaine cre|dulity for faith. And the rea&s;on of all this is, becau&s;e the be&s;t Graces have their Coun|terfeits, and from hence come tho&s;e many mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Now for the power and truth of Religion we &s;hall the better know it, if we fir&s;t briefly di&s;cover what it is not, and then what it is. What it is not; It doth not con&s;i&s;t in a bare hearing of the word, though heard never &s;o frequently, nor in a bare performance of o|ther duties, which are good in them&s;elves, though praiers perform'd ne'r &s;o con&s;tantly; long prayers wil not excu&s;e the devouring of vvidovvs hou&s;es, nor the doing of other good duties, any the like acts of oppre&s;&s;ion and violence. Thou Preache&s;t, thou heare&s;t, thou reade&s;t, thou praye&s;t, but how live&s;t thou? what doe&s;t thou? if the&s;e que&s;tions cannot be well re&s;olved, all good perfor|mances will prove nothing worth.</P>
<P>Again, the power and truth of Religion is not manife&s;ted in a ra&s;h cen&s;uring and condemning of others, I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican (you know who &s;aid it.) It doth not con&s;i&s;t in the ex|alting of a mans &s;elf above others, what&s;o|ever his gifts and graces are. It is not to be found meerly in an ability to talk or
<PB N="540" REF="289">
prattle, or di&s;pute, or wrangle, and after to hold the conclu&s;ion, what&s;oever may be &s;aid again&s;t it in the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>But for the truth and power of Religion, if we would briefly, and in &s;ome particulars know what it is, it is that which makes a man labour fir&s;t to know, and then to be|lieve, and to do what&s;oever is to be bele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ved and to be done, but to believe and do rather than to know. It is that which makes a man put a better e&s;teem upon others than upon him&s;elf. It is that which puts a guard on the lips, a bridle on the tongue, a cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">b on the will, and gives Rules to the affections; vvhich, vvhen they are high and exalted, keep the heart &s;till lovv, Becau&s;e the more acquaintance the heart hath vvith God, the more humble it is, even behol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing through Gods purity its ovvn vilene&s;s. And there|fore a man (in vvhom the truth and povver of Religion &s;hines) vvhen he hears of &s;inners, borrovvs the Apo&s;tles language, and &s;aith of him&s;elf, that I am the chief, for he kee|ping a continuall guard and vvatch over him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elf, can accu&s;e him&s;elf of thou&s;and, both faylings and &s;ins, vvhen he is free from all the vvorld be&s;ide. This further makes a man to behold indifferent things vvith obedience, rather than vvith oppo&s;ition or di&s;pute,

knovving that the vvi&s;dom vvhich is from above, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t <HI>pure</HI> and then <HI>peaceable.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly therefore, when the truth and power of Religion is &s;eparated from the profe&s;&s;ion thereof, a mans Religion is no|thing worth for in this Ca&s;e there is &s;mall difference 'twixt an I&s;raelite and an <HI>I&s;hmae|lite,</HI> 'twixt a Circumci&s;ed Hebrew, and an uncircumci&s;ed Phili&s;tine, 'twixt a Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ized Engli&s;hman, and an unwa&s;hen Turk F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r the barren Figtree in Gods Orchard is in no better ca&s;e, than the bramble in the wilder|ne&s;s, for God will lap them both up in the &s;ame bundle of condemnation, It being all one to deny the faith, and not &s;oundly and &s;incerely to profe&s;s it.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;on which makes us men, it is Re|ligion that makes us Chri&s;tians, woe be to us that we were borne men if, we be not Chri&s;tians, woe be to us that we are called Chri&s;tians, if our lives &s;hame our Chri&s;tiani|ty, if we be not Chri&s;tians in deed, and in earne&s;t, as well in name, and in profe&s;&s;ion &s;o.</P>
<P>We quarrell at the &s;uper&s;tition and blind devotion of others. But let us examine our &s;elves, whether &s;uper&s;tition in them, hath not a great deal of more heat in it, than Re|ligion in us; whether in their blind devo|tion,

That we, who wonder at &s;uch people as I have named in Ea&s;t India, as at others for their au&s;teritie of life, which they voluntarily and uncon|&s;trainedly &s;ubmit unto in their will-wor|&s;hips, mu&s;t never conceive that doing vvhat vve plea&s;e, what vve vvill, can bring us at la&s;t to true happine&s;s.
