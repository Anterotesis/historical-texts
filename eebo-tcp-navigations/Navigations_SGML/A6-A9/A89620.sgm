<P>_WWhereas in the cour&s;e of this in&s;uing Hi&s;to|ry there occurs frequent men|tion of the chief Provin|ces and Cities in <HI>China;</HI> which have either been a&s;&s;aulted and de|fended, &s;ubdued or de&s;troyed, by the &s;everall Armies, a&s;well from North to South, as from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; lea&s;t the plea&s;ure and de|light of this Hi&s;tory, &s;hould be any way dimini&s;hed by the fre|quent re-encounter of har&s;h and
<PB REF="4"> barbarous names of Countries, and Towns unknown to the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Reader, whil&s;t his atten|tion follows the victorious Army. I thought it good to prefix a little Geographical table of the Coun|tries, and chief Cities, which might &s;erve as a guide to con|duct the eye of the under&s;tanding, in the pur&s;uit of the mentioned victories. I confe&s;s it is not &s;o exact as the rigour of Geography exacts, but yet it is &s;uch an one, as was drawn by the hands of their learned Philo&s;ophers, and may well give us a &s;ufficient no|tion of all the places mentioned.</P>
<P>As for more exqui&s;it, and rare Maps both univer&s;al and parti|cular, as well of the Countries, as of the Cities, and of all the rari|ties they contain, together with the exact knowledge of their Longitudes and Latitudes, and of
<PB REF="4"> all that does belong either to A|&s;tronomy or Geography relati|on to them; with what may be ex|pected from Natural or Humane Hi&s;tory, I re&s;erve all the&s;e rari|ties and curio&s;ities to my <HI>Atlas of China</HI> which I am compo&s;ing; taken from their own antient re|cords ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Noah;</HI> all which I have with incredible pains, and indu&s;try both gathered up together, and tran&s;ported with me to <HI>Europe.</HI> I will not there|fore for the pre&s;ent deflower that worth of its greate&s;t beauty, by an un&s;ea&s;onable expo&s;ition of it to the Readers view; but expect till it grow to that perfection, as I hope will ravi&s;h the un&s;atiable appetits of this our curious Age.</P>

<HEAD>BELLUM TARTARICUM, <HI>OR</HI> The Hi&s;tory of the Warrs of the <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>China</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE mo&s;t antient Na|tion of <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which was the Parent of many Nations, had been an Enemy of the Empire of <HI>China</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> were antient E|nemies to <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> above Four Thou&s;and years: during which time, as they had many &s;harp Warrs with tho&s;e of <HI>China,</HI> in which they were &s;omtimes conquered, &s;o al&s;o more often they remained Conquerers of the Provinces of that Nation.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
<P>I call that Nation <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are the <HI>Tar|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">s.</HI></NOTE> which inhabiting the Northern parts, behind that famous Wall which &s;tretching out above 300. <HI>German</HI> Leagues from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, hath ever &s;erved for a Rampart to hinder their irrupti|ons into the &s;aid Empire.</P>
<P>This Country the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> ha|ving a defect of the letter R. an|tiently called <HI>Tata:</HI> comprehen|ding under this name as well the Oriental <HI>Tartars,</HI> hitherto unknown to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> as the Occidental, containing the Pro|vinces, <HI>Sumahania, Tanyu, Ni|uche, Niulhan,</HI> and the like, from the le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary,</HI> and Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;cor,</HI> to the Oriental Sea a|bove <HI>Japony,</HI> where they are &s;e|parated by the Streight of <HI>Ani|an,</HI> from <HI>Oviora</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> if yet it be a Streight and not a Continent.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<P>But it is not my intention to write all the Warrs which have pa&s;&s;ed betwixt them; but only of &s;uch as have happned in our me|mory, and in my pre&s;ence; All the re&s;t &s;hall appear at large in my Abridgement of the Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>China.</HI> And that we may proceed with more Order, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to reflect, how and from whence tho&s;e Trou|bles had their begining.</P>
<P>It is therefore fir&s;t to be known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> con|quered <HI>Chi+na</HI> hereto|fore.</NOTE> that the antient We&s;tern <HI>Tartars</HI> (of whom <HI>Paulus Vene|tus,</HI> and <HI>Ayton</HI> make mention under the names of <HI>Cataye</HI> and <HI>Maningin</HI>) waged war again&s;t <HI>China</HI> after they had &s;ubdued al|mo&s;t all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to their Power; and this before the times of great <HI>Tamberlain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tamber|lain</HI> never tooke <HI>Chi|na.</HI></NOTE> who never reigned in <HI>China</HI> as &s;ome have fal&s;ly
<PB N="4" REF="8"> writ; for he flori&s;hed about the year MCCCCVI; in which time <HI>Taichangus,</HI> Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> and the &s;econd of the <HI>Tai|mingian</HI> Family (the <HI>Tartars</HI> be|ing before beaten out of his Kingdome) governed peaceably all the Provinces included with|in the compa&s;s of that Va&s;te Wall which before I mentio|ned.</P>
<P>But the War which <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> toucheth, betwixt the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> began in the year MCCVI. as their Hi|&s;tory and Chronology te&s;tify, which la&s;ting 77. years, at la&s;t in the year MCCLXXVIII. having totally conquered all that potent Empire, they ex|tingui&s;hed the Imperial Family of the <HI>Sungas,</HI> and erected a new Regal Family, which they called <HI>Juena;</HI> of which <HI>Tarta|rian</HI>

<P>In this tract of time, the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> forgetting their antient Vi|gour of Mind and warlike Spi|rits, which the plea&s;ures and de|lices of that Country had quai|led and tamed, being al&s;o weak|ned by &s;o long a Peace, became of a &s;weeter temper, and recei|ved a deep Tincture of the Na|ture and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Na|tives of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon a contemptible per&s;on (who was &s;ervant to one of tho&s;e deputed to offer Sacri|fice to their Idolls) called <HI>Hugh,</HI> pre&s;umed to rebell again&s;t them.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<P>This man commi&s;erating the condition of his en&s;laved Coun|try, and al&s;o touched with the ambition of Reigning, fir&s;t acted the part of a Thief, or High-way man; and being of a Generous Nature, bold, and as quick at hand as in wit; wanted neither Courage, nor Art, nor Compa|nions, nor Fortune, to gather &s;uch a multitude as in &s;hort time made up the va&s;t body of an Ar|my; whereupon depo&s;ing the per&s;on of a Thief, he became a General, and with a bold at|tempt pre&s;umed to &s;et upon the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and having waged ma|ny Warrs again&s;t them, obtain|ed many &s;ingular Victories; &s;o as in the year 1368. he finally drove them out of the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> receiving for &s;o memo|rable an action, the whole Em|pire of <HI>China</HI> as a worthy reward of his Heroical Actions.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>It was he fir&s;t erected the Impe|rial Family of the <HI>Taiminges,</HI> and being he was the fir&s;t Em|perour of that Race, &s;tiled him|&s;elf by the name of <HI>Hunguus;</HI> which &s;ignifies as much as, <HI>The famous Warriour.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;uch an illu&s;trious Acti|on, it was no wonder if all the Provinces &s;ubmitted to him, both as to one that was a Native of their Country, and al&s;o becau&s;e they looked on him as a man who had redeemed them from Thraldome: for it is the Nature of the people of <HI>China</HI> to love and e&s;teem their own, as much as they hate and vilify Stran|gers.</P>
<P>Wherefore he fir&s;t placed his Court at <HI>Nanking</HI> neer to the bank of that great River of <HI>Ki|ang,</HI> which the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> in re|&s;pect of the huge Mountains of
<PB N="8" REF="10"> water which it di&s;charges into the Ocean, call the <HI>Son of the Sea:</HI> And having &s;peedily order|ed; and e&s;tabli&s;hed that Empire, fearing no In&s;urrections from the&s;e new redeemed Creatures, he was not contented to have cha&s;ed the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of <HI>China,</HI> but he made an irruption into <HI>Tartary</HI> it &s;elf, and &s;o followed the point of his Victory, as that he routed them &s;everal times, wa&s;ted all their Territories, and finally brought the Oriental <HI>Tartars</HI> to &s;uch &s;treights, as he forced them to lay down their Arms, to pay Tribute, and even begge an Ignominious Peace. This Storm of War fell chiefly on the <HI>Tartars</HI> of the Province of <HI>Niuche,</HI> whither the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>China</HI> being expelled were retired.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> every year,
<PB N="9" REF="10"> either as Subjects or Friends, came into <HI>China</HI> by the Province of <HI>Leaotung</HI> to traffick with the Inhabitants; For, being brought to poverty and mi&s;ery, they thought no more of making war again&s;t <HI>China.</HI> The Merchan|di&s;e they brought were &s;everal, as the root cal'd <HI>Gin&s;em,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teemed among&s;t the <HI>Chine|&s;es,</HI> and all &s;orts of pretious skins, as tho&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;tor, Martais</HI> &amp; <HI>Zi|bellens;</HI> and al&s;o Hor&s;e-hair, of which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> make their Nets, and the men, though mad|ly, u&s;e it in tying up their hair, as the hand&s;ome&s;t dre&s;s they can appear in. But tho&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> multiplyed &s;o fa&s;t, as they grew quickly into &s;even Governments which they called <HI>Hordes,</HI> as much as to &s;ay into &s;even Lord|&s;hips, and the&s;e fighting one a|gain&s;t another, at length about
<PB N="10" REF="11"> the year of Chri&s;t MDL. came to erect a Kingdom, which they called the Kingdome of <HI>Niuche.</HI></P>
<P>Thus &s;tood <HI>China</HI> in relation to the Ea&s;tern <HI>Tartars;</HI> but to the We&s;tern <HI>Tartars</HI> they payed Tribute masked under the Title of Pre&s;ents, that they might de|&s;i&s;t from War;</P>
<P>For the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> e&s;teem it ve|ry unhan&s;om to make war a|gain&s;t any, if by any other means their Country can be con&s;erved in Peace and quietne&s;s, being taught this by their Philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>But in the mean time, being over jealous of the Enemies to their antient riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Garri&s;on upon the Wall a|gain&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> they never left that great Wall, which ex|tends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, with|out a Million of <HI>Sorelgers</HI> to guard it.</P>
<P>Therefore this Kingdom of
<PB N="11" REF="11"> <HI>China</HI> being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A long Peace in <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> enjoyed a con&s;tant Peace and quietne&s;s for CCL. years, and whil&s;t the &s;even Lords or Governors made Civil wars, that renowned Em|perour of <HI>China,</HI> known by the name of <HI>Vanley</HI> being the thir|teenth Emperour of <HI>Taiminges</HI> Family, governed happily the Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> from the year 1573. to the year 1620. with as much Prudence as Ju|&s;tice and Equity.</P>
<P>But in this time the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Niuche</HI> had &s;o multiplied and &s;pred them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> think of inva|ding <HI>Chi|na.</HI></NOTE> as that being incorporated into a Kingdome, they became daily more formi|dable to <HI>China:</HI> And therefore the Governors of the bordering Countries, con&s;ulted privatly a|mong&s;t them&s;elves how they might curb and re&s;train the&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="12"> people within their limits: For their Governors have &s;o much Power and Authority, that al|though they live as Slaves to their Prince, yet when there is que&s;tion of a Common and pub|lick good, they govern ab&s;olute|ly and uncontroulably; unle&s;s by &s;ome higher Powers their Or|ders be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore the Prefects or Governors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t cau&s;e of the <HI>Tarta|rian</HI> war.</NOTE> did abu&s;e the Mer|chant's <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Niuche</HI> when they came into <HI>Leaotung,</HI> which is a Province confines next to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;e|cond cau&s;e.</NOTE>Then again when the King of <HI>Niuche</HI> would have married his Daughter to another King of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> they hindred this mar|riage by repre&s;enting &s;ome pre|tended rea&s;ons of State.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third cau&s;e.</NOTE>And finally when the King of <HI>Niuche</HI> &s;u&s;pected nothing from
<PB N="13" REF="12"> them he conceived his friends, they took him by deceit, and kil|led him perfidiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Wherefore to revenge the&s;e in|juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t irruption of the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> into <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> the Kings Son gathered a &s;trong Army, &amp; taking his time, found means to get over the great Wall I mentioned; and the great River being frozen, he pre&s;ently &s;et upon the great City <HI>Kaiyven,</HI> (or as others call it <HI>Taxun</HI>) which lies upon the Confines of <HI>Tartary,</HI> which he took in the year MDCXVI.</P>
<P>From this City he writ a Let|ter in <HI>Tartarian</HI> Characters to the Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> which though writ in Barbarian Cha|racters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> Pro|te&s;tation again&s;t <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> yet contained nothing barbarous. By this Letter which he &s;ent by one of their <HI>Indian</HI> Prie&s;ts (whom they call <HI>Lama</HI>) in a very humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner he declared to him, that
<PB N="14" REF="13"> he had invaded his Country to revenge the injuries he had received from the Governors of the neighbouring Provin|ces. But yet that he was rea|dy to re&s;tore the City he had taken, and depo&s;e his Arms, if his Complaints might be heard, and &s;atisfaction given him. The Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> called <HI>Van|ley,</HI> having received this Letter, though otherwaies of an eminent wi&s;dom, and of as great experi|ence, yet being now broken with Age, in this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to have proceeded with le&s;s Pru|dence than that which accompa|nied the former Actions of his life; For, thinking it not to be a bu&s;ine&s;s of that moment as it de|&s;erved to be treated before him in his own Court, he remitted the bu&s;ine&s;s to the chief Gover|nors and Commanders. And
<PB N="15" REF="13"> the&s;e men puffed up with their u|&s;ual pride, thought it not &s;it &s;o much as to give an an&s;wer to the <HI>Barbarian</HI> King, but re&s;ent|ed it very highly that any dur&s;t be &s;o bold as to complain to the Emperor of any injury receiv'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartarian</HI> King, &s;eeing they vouch&s;afed no an&s;wer to his ju&s;t Demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bar|barous and &s;uper&s;titi|ous Vow of the <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> King</NOTE> turning his anger into rage, vowed to celebrate his Fathers Funerals with the lives of two hundred Thou&s;and of the Inhabitants of <HI>China.</HI> For it is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tartars</HI> when any man of quality dyeth, to ca&s;t into that fire which con&s;umes the dead Corps, as many Servants, Women, and Hor&s;es with Bows and Arrows, as may fit to a|tend and &s;erve them in the next life: Though now &s;ince they conquered <HI>China,</HI> they have left off this barbarous cu&s;tome, be|ing
<PB N="16" REF="14"> reprehended and corrected for it by the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> them&s;elves.

<PB N="43" REF="27"> was divided, and many &s;tragling up and down the Coun|trie) made a huge Carnage a|mong&s;t them. But when <HI>Mao|venlungus</HI> percieved they were <HI>Tartars,</HI> he pre&s;ently made head, and gathered a Body of an Ar|mie together, and vigorou&s;ly op|po&s;ed all tho&s;e &s;harp a&s;&s;aults. But yet at length he was forced to yield the Field; and therefore leaving a Regiment or two to hold the Enemie in action whil&s;t his Army retreated, he fled to his Ships, and to the I&s;land which he had Fortified. The <HI>Tartars</HI> were vexed and grieved, both to &s;ee their victory &s;o bloo|dy, and al&s;o that <HI>Maovenlungus,</HI> whom they chiefly aimed at, had e&s;caped with mo&s;t of his Army; and therefore enraged with An|ger, they fell upon the <HI>Corean</HI> Traitors, and killed every man;
<PB N="44" REF="28"> which action the King of <HI>Tartary</HI> much condemned; and then turn|ing their wrath to the four Nor|thern Provinces, which border upon <HI>Tartary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Corea</HI> wa|&s;ted.</NOTE> they wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed them all in a moment.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King of <HI>Corea</HI> gathered an Army to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and <HI>Maovenlungus</HI> al&s;o, having recruited his Forces, came into <HI>Corea</HI> to revenge the received lo&s;s.

The Battel was hardly begun, but <HI>Maovenlungus,</HI> after a long march, falls in upon their rear: and the <HI>Tartars</HI> finding them|&s;elves encompa&s;&s;ed before and
<PB N="45" REF="28"> behind, nor any means to e&s;cape but by dint of Sword, fought mo&s;t de&s;peratelie, &s;u&s;taining the &s;hock of two Armies; And &s;uch a Battel was fought, as <HI>China</HI> ne|ver &s;aw; for, (it is &s;trange to write, yet very true) of the three Armies, none was victorious, but all in a manner de&s;troyed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fight and &s;laugh+ter of 3 Armies.</NOTE> Of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Armie fifty thou|&s;and were found wanting; The <HI>Corean</HI> Armie lo&s;t &s;eventy thou|&s;and; and few or none e&s;caped of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> Armie; For their Quarter being mo&s;t commodious for the <HI>Tartars</HI> flight, they there made their mo&s;t vigorous Char|ges, and &s;o forced their way to|wards their own Countrie. So as none of them all gained the field, or could pro&s;ecute the cour&s;e of a Victorie.

<P>In this conjuncture of affairs,
<PB N="47" REF="29"> the Emperour <HI>Zungchinius</HI> &s;ent a new Commander called <HI>Yvenus</HI> into <HI>Leaotung,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A crafty Comman|der of the <HI>China</HI> Ar|my.</NOTE> with a new Armie and full power to conclude a Peace with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> if they would admit it: For the di&s;or|ders of the times had cau&s;ed &s;o many needy per&s;ons, Theevs, and Cut-throats, that the Empe|rour grew more anxious how to &s;uppre&s;s this great dome&s;tick E|nemie, which &s;eemed to aim at the Kingdoms ruin, than he was of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Forces. This <HI>Yvenus</HI> was a crafty and &s;ubtill wit, mo&s;t eloquent both in &s;peak|ing and writing; who by politick di&s;cour&s;es, drawn from the na|ture of this war, had wrought &s;o much, not only upon the Empe|rours mind, but al&s;o upon all the Councill, that they e&s;teemed what he concluded as a Law to be ob&s;erved: Wherefore the
<PB N="48" REF="30"> <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> put all their confidence in him; nor had they been fru&s;tra|ted of their hopes, had not this wicked man been more wedded to his own intere&s;t, and love of Riches, than to the publick good, &amp; fidelitie to his Prince: For fir&s;t he received of the <HI>Tartars</HI> a va&s;t Summe of gold; which wrought &s;o much upon him, as that ha|ving invited to a Banquet that mo&s;t Valorous and Faithfull Champion <HI>Maovenlungus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maoven|lungus</HI> poi|&s;oned.</NOTE> whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> only feared, he there poi&s;oned that great Comman|der.</P>
<P>After this he made a mo&s;t ig|nominious and &s;hamefull Peace with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> conde&s;cending to all that tho&s;e that fed him with Riches, could de&s;ire; But when the Emperour had peru&s;ed the Treatie, he pre&s;ently found his Plenipotentiarian had &s;old
<PB N="49" REF="30"> him, and therefore refu&s;ed to ra|tifie or confirm the Articles. What &s;hould <HI>Yvenus</HI> act in this exigent? That he might force the Emperour to admit them, he pe&s;waded the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in the year 1630. to enter <HI>China</HI> by another Country than that which was committed to his charge, promi&s;ing them for his part, he would no way hinder their progre&s;&s;e by his Army. The <HI>Tartars</HI> knew that his ava|rice had &s;o potent an A&s;cendent over him, as that they need to fear no hurt from him; and upon that Confidence admitted of his Coun&s;ell. Wherefore being &s;e|cure from all a&s;&s;aults from any Enemie behind them, they en|tered the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> and be&s;ieged the Kings Court:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Court be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> In&s;o|much that his Councel per&s;wa|ded him to leave the Imperial

In the mean time the <HI>Tartars</HI> make many fierce affaults, and as often were valiantly beaten back with great lo&s;s and Carnage. <HI>Yvenus</HI> was called to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> for as yet his Traiterous Complots were not di&s;covered. And le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;cover his Trea&s;on, he comes with his Ar|mie neer the very Walls, which were of &s;o va&s;t an extent, as both the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> Armie might perfectly be di&s;cerned, though betwixt them there was a great Intervall. But though <HI>Y|venus</HI> was under the Emperours eye, yet he acted little; for his only aim was to return home la|den
<PB N="51" REF="31"> with Riches, he never de&s;i|&s;ted to per&s;wade the Emperour to admit his conditions of Peace. So that the Emperour finding him evidently to be a Traitor, di&s;clo&s;ing his intention to none of his Councell nor Governors, &s;ends to invite him to a pri|vat Councel of war, giving al&s;o order that he &s;hould be admitted into the Citie by the Walls, le&s;t if any Gate &s;hould be open, the <HI>Tartar</HI> being &s;o neer might pre&s;s in upon them; but indeed he or|dered the bu&s;ine&s;s in this man|ner, le&s;t he &s;hould bring his Ar|mie into the City with him. <HI>Yve|nus</HI> therfore knowing he had ma|ny chief men about the Empe|rours per&s;on, who were both his favourites and friends, and that none of them gave him the lea&s;t &s;ign of any di&s;ta&s;t the Emperor might conceive again&s;t him, he
<PB N="52" REF="32"> boldly and &s;ecurely pre&s;ented him&s;elf at Court; and as &s;oon as he appeared, he was pre&s;ently arre&s;ted, and after &s;ome few que&s;tions, the Emperour com|manded him to be kil'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The perfi|dious Ge|neral kil|led.</NOTE> The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> hearing of his death (before the <HI>China</HI> Armie had a new Ge|neral a&s;&s;igned) ran&s;ack all the Country round about, and after they had made excur&s;ions to the next bordering Province of <HI>Xan|tung,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> for|rage all the Coun|try of <HI>Pe|king</HI> and depart.</NOTE> richly laden with all man|ner of Spoiles, they returned to their fir&s;t re&s;idence in <HI>Leaotung.</HI></P>
<P>And from the&s;e times till the year 1636. the event of their Warrs was very various; but in general we ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> could never fix a foot in <HI>Chi|na,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Tartary</HI> dies; ano|ther &s;uc|ceeds.</NOTE> but they were pre&s;ently bea|ten out again. In this &s;ame year <HI>Thienzungus,</HI> King of the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> died, after whom, &s;ucceeded
<PB N="53" REF="32"> his Son <HI>Zungteus,</HI> father to him that now governs <HI>China,</HI> of whom we now mu&s;t begin to Treat.</P>
<P>This Prince before his Reign expre&s;&s;ed much judgement in &s;e|verall Occurrences,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zungteus</HI> the new King of <HI>Tartary,</HI> prudent &amp; milde.</NOTE> &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the Kings of <HI>Tartary</HI> in Hu|manity, and obliging curte&s;ie: For when he was young, he was &s;ent by his Father into <HI>China;</HI> where he lived &s;ecretly, and learned the <HI>China</HI>'s Manners, Doctrine and Language; and when he came to be Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> he changed, and far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the Examples of his Predece&s;&s;ors: For having ob&s;er|ved, that their too hard and cruel u&s;age of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> had been the principal ob&s;tacle of their ad|vancement, to the end he might conquer that Empire he &s;o much thir&s;ted after, as well by love as
<PB N="54" REF="33"> by Arms, he curteou&s;ly enter|tained and cheri&s;hed all tho&s;e of <HI>China</HI> which came unto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mildene&s;s and Gen|tlene&s;s to be u&s;ed in Conquer|ing Nati|ons.</NOTE> u|&s;ing all Pri&s;oners with great &s;weetnes, and invited them either to &s;ubmit freely to his Govern|ment, or take their cour&s;e with full freedom. The fame of his humanity was &s;pred far and neer; which induced many Commanders and chief Officers to fly unto him; by who&s;e means and help, he became Emperour of that &s;pacious and flori&s;hing Country. For experience &s;hews us, that Love and Humanity doe work more upon mens hearts, in conquering and con|&s;erving Kingdomes, than Arms; and cruelty of the Conquerors hath lo&s;t that, which &s;trength of Arms had happily &s;ubdued. Wherefore when the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> came to under&s;tand that the King
<PB N="55" REF="33"> of <HI>Tartary</HI> did not only afford them a Sanctuary, but a favoura|ble Haven, many great per&s;ons flying the Indignation of the King of <HI>China,</HI> &s;heltered them|&s;elves under the <HI>Tartars</HI> prote|ction. For in re&s;pect of the <HI>Chi|na</HI>'s Avarice and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, it's a nece&s;&s;ary but a mo&s;t inhu|mane Maxim,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A barba|rous Prin|ciple of the <HI>Chine|&s;es.</HI></NOTE> that tho&s;e Offi|cers peri&s;h, who have managed the Kingdomes Affairs with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s. For they ea&s;ily are brought to believe, that &s;uch un|happy events, do not proceed &s;o much from the frown of a &s;corn|full Godde&s;s called Fortune, as it doth from the perfidy and negligence of the Commanders. So as if any fought unhappily, or if he lo&s;t the Country commit|ted to his charge, if any Sedi|tion or Rebellion happened, the Governors hardly ever e&s;caped
<PB N="56" REF="34"> alive. Seeing therefore they found &s;o much Humanity in the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and &s;o much Inhumanity in the Emperor, they rather cho&s;e to fly to the former.</P>
<P>By this occa&s;ion give me leave to relate what happened to that incomparable Commander (re|nouned both for Fidelity and Fortitude) called <HI>Ignatius.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ignatius</HI> the chief Comman|der of the Chri&s;tians unju&s;tly killed.</NOTE> This Heroick mind preferd his fideli|tie to his Prince, before his life, before the <HI>Tartarian</HI>'s protecti|on, yea even before the &s;trength of his formidable Army; and cho&s;e rather, with his unparallel'd Fidelity, to &s;ubmit his head to a Block by an unju&s;t &s;entence, than to abandon his Country, or once accu&s;e the lea&s;t default in his So|vereign's judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ignatius</HI> his fidelity.</NOTE> though pre|vented, by very unju&s;t impre&s;&s;i|ons: He might perchance have &s;wayed the Sovereign Scepter of
<PB N="57" REF="34"> <HI>China,</HI> if he would have hear|kened to his Souldiers, but he rather cho&s;e to die gloriou&s;ly, than to be branded with the name of a Traitor in po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This man therefore after he had gained &s;everal Victories a|gain&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and recover|ed many Cities from their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, &s;o as he hoped &s;hortly who|ly to extirpate them out of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> His Souldiers being long without pay, &s;editiou&s;ly plun|dred and pillaged a Town which had ever been faithfull to the K. <HI>Ignatius</HI> by &s;everal petitions and Remon&s;trances to the Emperour, had declared his wants of mony, and their want of Pay; but be|cau&s;e he fed not tho&s;e venal &s;ouls that managed the bu&s;ine&s;s with mony and pre&s;ents, they alwaies &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his humble addre&s;&s;es for relief. Be&s;ides, this man be|ing
<PB N="85" REF="35"> a very pious Chri&s;tian, he did nothing in his government,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ignatius</HI> his Piety.</NOTE> but what was conform to Rea|&s;on and Ju&s;tice; which was the cau&s;e he incurred the hatred of all the antient Prefects; who u&s;u|ally receiving Bribes from the conte&s;ting parties, demanded fa|vour of <HI>Ignatius</HI> for their Cli|ents. But it was in vain to inter|cede for any, unle&s;s the ju&s;tne&s;s of the cau&s;e did al&s;o ballance their Petitions. And the&s;e men attributing this proceeding, not to vertue, but to his Pride, think|ing them&s;elves undervalued by him, dealt under-hand with the Prefects in the Court, to &s;top the Armies pay, that &s;o they might de&s;troy this innocent man. More|over, he was envied the Com|ma~ders in the very Court, becau&s;e he came to this eminent dignitie by his own valour and indu&s;trie;
<PB N="95" REF="35"> which they imagined was only to be given to Doctors, and <HI>Ignati|us</HI> was but a Batchelor; as if the mo&s;t learned mu&s;t needs be al&s;o the mo&s;t valorous. In this conjun|cture of affairs, the Souldiers not contented with the &s;editious pil|lage, &s;eeing the mo&s;t imminent danger hanging over their mo&s;t e&s;teemed and beloved Gover|nour, by rea&s;on of their folly, they go about to per&s;wade him to make him&s;elf King of that Country, nay more, to take the whole Empire to him&s;elf, as a thing due to his Prowe&s;s and Merits; promi&s;ing their whole &s;trength to effect the bu&s;ine&s;s; and al&s;o to extirpate tho&s;e men about the Emperour, that aimed more to compa&s;s their malicious ends, than to promote the general affairs of the Empire: But <HI>Igna|tius,</HI> by pious admonitions, &s;ta|ved
<PB N="60" REF="36"> them off from further vio|lence, made them obedient and quiet, commanded all to &s;tand faithfull to the Emperour of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> and puni&s;hed the chief of that fedition.</P>
<P>This Supreme act of fidelity de&s;erved a better e&s;teem and ac|ceptance, than that which was framed by the Emperour and his Court: who &s;lighting this his allegeance, &s;ent another Vice|Roy in his place, and comman|ded him to appear in Court: He then perceived they aimed at his life; and the Souldiers &s;u&s;pected the bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore, mad with anger, they all jointly ro&s;e in Arms for hm, &s;wearing they would live and die with him, and that he &s;hould not pre&s;ent him|&s;elfe at Court. <HI>It is our duty</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>to con&s;erve thy life, which ha&s;t been &s;o carefull of ours; and
<PB N="61" REF="36"> we have &s;trength and courage e|nough to re&s;i&s;t all the force of thy perfidious Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Ignatius</HI> was deaf to al the&s;e allurements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He chu&s;es rather to die, thatn either to reign, or to &s;erve the <HI>Tar|tars.</HI></NOTE> and &s;tudied by all means to &s;weeten their exulcera|ted minds; alwaies inculcating to them to the true and loyall to their Sovereigns &s;ervice: chu&s;ing rather to water that ungratefull Soil of his native Country with the &s;treams of his Blood, than either to &s;pill his Enemies blood by the force and pow'r of his Souldiers, or retire to the <HI>Tarta|rian</HI> king, which offered him &s;o fair preferments. But many of his Captains fell off to the <HI>Tar|tars;</HI> following, in this, not his example, but that of many o|thers, whom they &s;aw eminently promoted among&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Some of tho&s;e that then fled from the Emperour, are now

<P>But although hitherto the&s;e <HI>Tartarian</HI> Warrs had cau&s;ed great troubles and tempe&s;ts in the <HI>China</HI> Empire, yet all things now &s;eemed calmed and pacified, &s;o as they &s;eemed &s;ecure from any fur|ther danger; for the We&s;tern part of <HI>Leaotung</HI> was &s;trongly forti|fied, and there was a great Army in the I&s;land of <HI>Cu,</HI> and the bor|dering quarters, which hindered the <HI>Tartars</HI> of the Ea&s;tern part of the Countrie, which they po|&s;e&s;&s;ed, from further pa&s;&s;age.

<P>In the mean time a third cau&s;e of this Empires ruin grew up in the Court;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre|fects Di&s;|cord was another cau&s;e of the ruin of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> which was hatched in the Emperour <HI>Thienkius</HI> his time: For that Emperour exalted an Eunuch called <HI>Gueio,</HI> to &s;uch a height and power, as he gave the ab&s;olute Power and &s;o|veraign Command into his hands, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;o far as allway to &s;tile him by the name of Fa|ther.

<PB N="77" REF="44"> Coun&s;ellours: and the Eunuch al&s;o added much to incen&s;e the flame, by his indi&s;creet u&s;age of the favour he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for if a|ny man had touched him, either in word or writing, or expre&s;&s;ed le&s;s re&s;pect unto him in conver|&s;ation, or behaviour, or did not flatter the ba&s;e fellow, he would pre&s;ently give order to put him to death, though he were a very eminent per&s;on; or at lea&s;t de|grade him from all Office or Dignity. By which means he ex|a&s;perated many, and among&s;t the re&s;t he offended the Prince <HI>Zunchinius,</HI> who now, by the death of his Brother without i&s;|&s;ue, was come to be Emperour of <HI>China.</HI> This Emperour knew that the Eunuch had moved Heaven and Earth to hinder his coming to the Crown; but &s;eeing he could not effect that, at lea&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="45"> he maintained a &s;editious faction again&s;t the great ones; which finally proved the de&s;truction of the E&s;tate; For the&s;e men band|ing in two factions, &s;tudied more how to de&s;troy one another, than to advance the publique good; yet both parties pretended the ge|neral good, but both neglected it; Every party endeavouring to ex|toll and exalt his own Creatures into places of tru&s;t and power: All which when <HI>Zunchinius</HI> the Emperour went about to redre&s;&s;e, he exa&s;perated the minds of many of the Commanders again&s;t him; for as &s;oon as he came to the Crown he cruelly per&s;ecuted all that favoured the Eunuch, and in fine killed this very Eunuch which had been his Predece&s;&s;ors Favou|rite, together with many more of his kind; of which Tragedy I will only relate the Cata&s;trophe. The

But by this occa&s;ion the Emperour rai&s;ed new Factions and more Traitors, which held

Hence it came to pa&s;s, that no Army was &s;ent to oppo&s;e them, or if any went they did no manner of action, being alwaies hindered by the e|mulation of others; nay it hap|pened often, that when they might have taken great advan|tages, yet the occa&s;ion was neg|lected, le&s;t the Commanders &s;hould increa&s;e their Power and Credit, by their Victories, with the Emperour.

<P>The happy &s;ucce&s;s in taking the impregnable Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> is attributed by wi&s;e men, (to who&s;e judgement I al&s;o &s;ub|mit) to a more remote and hid|den cau&s;e which I will briefly relate. There was at this time a famous and renowned Pyrat called <HI>Chinchilungus;</HI> this man was born in the Province of <HI>Fo|kien,</HI> of which we are treating; he fir&s;t &s;erved the <HI>Portegui&s;e</HI> in <HI>Macao;</HI> then he &s;erved the Hollander in the I&s;land called <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A famous Pyrate in <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> where he was known
<PB N="139" REF="75"> to all &s;trangers by the name of <HI>Iquon.</HI> After this he became a Pyrat, but being of quick and nimble wit, he grew from this &s;mall and &s;lender fortune, to &s;uch a height and power, as he was held either Superiour or equal to the Emperour of <HI>China;</HI> for he had the Trade of <HI>India</HI> in his hand; and he dealt with the <HI>Por|tugi&s;e</HI> in <HI>Macao;</HI> with the Spa|niards in the <HI>Phillippins,</HI> with the Hollanders in the I&s;land <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> and new <HI>Holland;</HI> with the <HI>Japonians,</HI> and with all the Kings and Princes of the Ea&s;tern parts in all manner of rich com|modities. He permitted none to tran&s;port the Wares of <HI>China</HI> but him&s;elf or his, to whom he brought back the riches and the Silver of <HI>Europ</HI> and <HI>Indies;</HI> for after he once rather extorted then obtained pardon of the King
<PB N="140" REF="76"> of <HI>China</HI> for his Pyracies, he be|came &s;o formidable, as that he had no le&s;s than three thou&s;and Ships of which he was Lord and Ma&s;ter. Nor was he contented with this fortune, but a&s;pired privatly to no le&s;s than to the Empire; But becau&s;e he knew he never &s;hould be accepted of the prefects &amp; people, as long as there was any of the Emperial Fami|ly of the <HI>Taiminges</HI> alive, he ho|ped by the <HI>Tartars</HI> means to ex|tingui&s;h them wholy, and after this was done, then he re&s;ol|ved to di&s;play his Banners and En&s;igns in &s;o pious a cau&s;e, as the driving out the common E|nemy from the bowels of the Kingdom, and no doubt but un|der this pretext, they would all have followed, helped and e|ven adored him, as their Savi|our.
<PB N="141" REF="76"> It was therefore evident that he had &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and that he favoured them for his own pro|fit; And that which made the bu&s;ine&s;s more &s;u&s;picious was, that at that time when the <HI>Tartars</HI> made their irruption into <HI>Foki|en,</HI> he was then declared Lord Mar&s;hal of the Kingdom, and all the Generals, Commanders and Souldiers, were either of his affinity, or wholy at his Com|mand and Obedience. And therefore it is no wonder if he found an ea&s;y admittance into the Country of <HI>Fokien;</HI> of which they pre&s;ently made him King <HI>Pingnan,</HI> (as much as to &s;ay; <HI>Pacifier of the South</HI>) and they added many other Dignities, and Offices of tru&s;t, that they might more &s;peciou&s;ly illude him; for either they knew his a&s;piring

He made him|&s;elf therefore &s;ecure of the Go|vernment of all the Southern Provinces; but all happened quite contrary to his expectati|on; for when this General of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who was ob&s;erved as a little King, was to depart to <HI>Peking,</HI> the cu&s;tom was for all the Officers of the Kingdom to conduct him, for &s;ome part of his journey to give him an ho|nourable farewell; which la&s;t

But when he came to take leave, and demand Licence to return; the General of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> invited him a long to <HI>Peking,</HI> where he promi&s;ed him yet greater ho|nours from the Kings own per|&s;on, to reward his Merits. He endeavoured by all imaginable occa&s;ions, to excu&s;e this journey, but nothing was accepted, he was forced by their kindne&s;s to accompany them to <HI>Peking;</HI> and &s;o he was taken by Art, who by Arms &s;eemed In&s;upe|rable.

<HEAD>An Addition to the former Hi&s;tory, taken out of the la&s;t Letters from <HI>China,</HI> Written in the years 1651. 52. and 53.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter the Printing of this our Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Wars, returning to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els</HI> from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> (where I u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition to bring my <HI>Atlas Sinieus</HI> to the Pre&s;s) I there, received my long de&s;ired Letters from <HI>China,</HI> &s;ent by my friends from <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;ome of which being da|ted the 14. of <HI>November</HI> 1651. were writ by a <HI>Sicilian</HI> called Father <HI>Francis Brancatus,</HI> who &s;ojurns in the City of <HI>Xanchai</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking;</HI> and
<PB N="228" REF="120"> reflecting, that happily it would not be ungrateful to our <HI>Euro|peans,</HI> if I made a private rela|tion of publick u&s;e; I re&s;olved to draw out this little en&s;uing Narration from tho&s;e Letters written in &s;everall years.</P>
<P>The Empire of <HI>China</HI> is now grown to a more fixed and &s;et|led E&s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See fol. 165.</NOTE> &s;ince the death of <HI>Amavangus</HI> Uncle to the Em|perour: who as he was the fir&s;t Man that &s;ugge&s;ted to the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> the Emperours inva&s;ion, &s;o al&s;o, it is to his care and vigilan|cy they owe the happy &s;ucce&s;s of all, and its con&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But yet, the opinion framed of him after his death, was far different from the authority and power he carried in his life; for no &s;ooner was the power of reigning by his death devolved into the hands of his Nephew called <HI>Xunchi;</HI> but that this Em|perour,
<PB N="229" REF="120"> though a youth in years, began his reign by the approba|tion of all e&s;tates and orders, with &s;uch maturity of judge|ment, and Councel, as he &s;ee|med to &s;urpa&s;s the gray and hory heads of his wi&s;e&s;t Coun|cellors. He was no &s;ooner in|throned, then he expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trange ripene&s;s of judgement and Ju&s;tice joyned together in the &s;ame Action;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Amavan|gus</HI> &s;u&s;|pected and puni|&s;hed after his death.</NOTE> for having di&s;covered his Uncles wicked Councels and De&s;igns, and tra|ced the ob&s;cure track of his ab|hominable vices, which were hid during his life: he did &s;o much re&s;ent tho&s;e dete&s;table Acts, as he commanded his bo|dy to be digged up, and his mag|nificent Sepulcher to be beaten down;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vene|ration of dead mens tombs; a|mong&s;t the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es.</HI></NOTE> which kind of puni&s;h|ment among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> it held to be the greate&s;t that can be inflicted; being taught by
<PB N="230" REF="121"> their Religion to carry all ve|neration and re&s;pect to the tombs of dead per&s;ons. The Carca&s;s being dragged out, they fir&s;t beat it with Clubs, then they &s;cour|ged it with Rods; and finally cutting off the head, they made it a &s;pectacle to all Criminal op|probies. Thus the &s;plendour of his Tomb, was brought to du&s;t; and fortune payed him after his death, the turn, &s;he owed him in his life. He puni&s;hed al&s;o all the Officers and Prefects, which were privy to his Councels; putting &s;ome to death, and de|priving others of their digni|ties. Among&s;t all which I find the fortune of General <HI>Fung</HI> to have been very various: who though he be no Chri&s;tian, yet being a &s;ingular friend, prote|ctor of my order, and particu|larly known to my &s;elf, I can|not but rejoyce to hear him re|&s;tored
<PB N="231" REF="121"> to his place and dignity, after his di&s;covered innocency. In the mean time the Emperour <HI>Xunchius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|perour of the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> Mar|riage and their cu|&s;toms.</NOTE> growing up to Mans e&s;tate, and &s;ollicitous to propa|gate his Augu&s;t off-&s;pring, re|&s;olved to accompli&s;h his long intended Marriage with the Daughter to the Emperour of the Occidental <HI>Tartars:</HI> In which action the <HI>Tartars</HI> imitate the <HI>European</HI> cu&s;tom; for they take a Lady of &s;ome illu&s;trious blood or de&s;cent; But the Emperours of <HI>China</HI> &s;eem little to value the nobility of blood, but &s;elect the prime&s;t beauty; nor will they refu&s;e a per&s;on of a mean for|tune, if &s;he be but graced with beauty; In &s;o much, as the Wife to the late Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> was Daughter to a Man, that got his living by making &s;traw Shoos. So King <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> rai&s;ed a poor Captive Maid to be Confort with him in his Royal
<PB N="232" REF="122"> Throne: which kind of cu&s;tom happily the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> drew from the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> or el&s;e the <HI>Per&s;i|ans</HI> had it from them. But to return to the &s;ubject that cau&s;ed this little digre&s;&s;ion. The Em|perours VVedding was perfor|med with a Pomp and &s;plendor proportionable to &s;uch an Em|pire: nor was there any magni|ficence wanting on the Spou&s;es part; for according to the fa|&s;hion of the Nation, &s;he came accompanied with whole Armies of Men, and &s;o many Troops of Hor&s;e, as they &s;eemed innu|merable; nature &s;eeming to have framed the riches of the <HI>Tartars</HI> more for warlike affairs, than for plea&s;ure. Nor is this infinit multitude of Hor&s;e incredible, for I my &s;elf have &s;een eighty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, all at one time, &s;ent as a pre&s;ent from the Occi|dental <HI>Tartars</HI> to the King of <HI>China.</HI></P>

So as the King of <HI>China</HI> called <HI>Jungley,</HI> with his chief favourit the Eunuch, called <HI>Pang Achileus,</HI> who profe&s;&s;eth Chri|&s;tianity, were feign to fly to the confines of <HI>Tunking,</HI> being in a manner excluded the whole Empire. In &s;o much as a friend of mine writes out of the Pro|vince of <HI>Fokien,</HI> that the King <HI>Jungley</HI> fearing to fall into the <HI>Tartars</HI> hands, was feign to leave the Land, and fly to Sea. But upon what Coa&s;t that unmerciful Element may have ca&s;t him, we know not, for we hear no news
<PB N="234" REF="123"> of our Father <HI>Andrew Xauerius Koffler</HI> who ever followed the Court of King <HI>Jungley,</HI> having had the happine&s;s to have Bap|tized his Queen, his Son, and his Mother with many others of that di&s;tracted Court.</P>
<P>In the mean time, whil&s;t one <HI>Cang,</HI> a Royolet among&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> &s;ubdued the Province of <HI>Quang&s;i,</HI> the Governour of the Country, whom they call <HI>Colaus,</HI> fell into the Enemies hands, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> hoping by rewards and promi&s;es of dignities, to &s;often the mind of this &s;o gal|lant a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great fidelity of the Go|vernour to his King.</NOTE> and &s;o eminent a Phil&s;opher, ab&s;tained three days from any cruelty, or ill u&s;age; But he &s;corned to prefer his life before his alleageance and fide|lity to his King; and therefore lo&s;t his head.</P>
<P>But yet, this generous Action was admired and honoured by
<PB N="235" REF="123"> tho&s;e bruti&s;h Souls, who pre|&s;ently erected a magnificent Tomb, in memory of &s;o honou|rable an Act; for although the <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;ollicit the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to re|volt from their Prince, yet they honour and prai&s;e &s;uch as &s;hew them&s;elves con&s;tant to him; And this memorial, I owe unto his memory, well for his &s;ingu|lar friend&s;hip he was plea&s;ed to contract with me, as al&s;o to his eminent vertues, of which, I my &s;elf and the whole Church of Chri&s;tians in <HI>China,</HI> were both Spectators and Admirers, for the &s;pace of twenty years. And that his name may not pe|ri&s;h, nor his Country; he was Born in the Province of <HI>Nan|quin</HI> in the City <HI>Changcho;</HI> be|ing called <HI>Kiu Thomas,</HI> a name worthy of eternal memory, in the Temple of vertue.</P>
<P>During the &s;accage of the&s;e
<PB N="236" REF="124"> Provinces; news arrives from the Country of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> that the notorious Brigand called <HI>Changhienchungus,</HI> famous for his infamous cruelty and abho|minable villanies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See fol. 197.</NOTE> was broke out again, and wa&s;ted all that Pro|vince with &s;everall tempe&s;ts of War; for though he &s;eemed to be quite vanqui&s;hed in the la&s;t Battails, yet he appeared again to trouble and vex the Empire with new Garboyls, and fur|ther De&s;igns of War.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> al&s;o began to grone under the &s;ame mi&s;erable condition of VVar; for the Reverend Father <HI>Peter Canevari</HI> Native of <HI>Genua,</HI> writes out of the City <HI>Chang|cheu</HI> which was be&s;ieged the 30. of <HI>March</HI> 1652. that <HI>Que&s;ingus</HI> having made a de&s;cent from his Ships into that Province had overrun the whole Country, ta|ken
<PB N="237" REF="124"> &s;ome Cities and Towns, and carried on the War with great terrour to the Inhabitants. In&s;o|much as the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Comman|ders kept them&s;elves, and their Army in their Forts, and other places of &s;trength, not daring to appear in the field to oppo&s;e them; but yet he &s;ayd they ex|pected new Forces and Succours from <HI>Peking;</HI> by which they doubt not, but quickly to &s;ub|due him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Que&s;ingus,</HI> who now vexeth this Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Que&s;ingus</HI> the Pyrat.</NOTE> is Son to the famous Pyrate <HI>I|quon</HI> or <HI>Chinchilungo</HI> whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> impri&s;oned by a &s;light, as I recounted to you in my for|mer Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And to let you know what I heard from &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers of <HI>China,</HI> who in the month of <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> 1653. were ca&s;t, in a Ship of <HI>China,</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts of an
<PB N="238" REF="125"> I&s;land called <HI>new Holland;</HI> whi|ther I had been brought before by their Barks, and Souldiers as their Pri&s;oner; The&s;e Men related that a great Army of <HI>Tartars</HI> was arrived, to &s;ubdue <HI>Que&s;ingus;</HI> who&s;e Commander thought it fit to joyn art to his great Force, and therefore he commanded a handfull of Men to charge the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Army, and pre&s;ently by feigning flights to retire to more advantagious and &s;urer places. But in the mean time, he had placed a number of Hor&s;e in a deep valley behind a Mountain, towards which Quarters the fugitive Troops re|tired. This flight gave courage to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the de&s;ire of victory, made them venture &s;o far from the River <HI>Chang,</HI> where their Ships lay at Anchor, as they found them&s;elves enviro|ned by the <HI>Tartars</HI> Army. This
<PB N="239" REF="125"> de&s;perate condition which ex|cluded the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> from retur|ning to their Ships, cau&s;ed a ve|ry &s;ad, and bloody Battail, in which there peri&s;hed above 8000 of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> Army;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Que&s;ingus</HI> defeated.</NOTE> whil&s;t <HI>Que&s;ingus</HI> a &s;pectator of this &s;ad accident from the Ma&s;t of his Ships, and as they relate, was heard to &s;ay, that he would once more try his fortune again&s;t the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but if &s;he proved a|gain adver&s;e unto him, he then would &s;ubmit, and &s;have his Hair, like a <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P>Having briefly related the State of the Temporality in this Kingdom, it remains I &s;hould touch a little of the State of Chri|&s;tianity, &s;ince the&s;e great revolu|tions.</P>
<P>In which &s;ubject, I can onely &s;ay, that being at <HI>Bru&s;els</HI> this la&s;t <HI>June</HI> in the year 1654. I recei|ved Letters from <HI>China,</HI> in which
<PB N="240" REF="126"> they gave me notice that the Fa|ther Je&s;uits, were very favou|rably treated by the <HI>Tartars;</HI> yea better than before, for they permitted free exerci&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Catholick Religi|on, through an their King|doms, granting them leave not onely to enjoy their antient Churches, but did al&s;o liberally contribute to build new ones; So by the goodne&s;s of God, that which endamaged others, proved gain to them.
