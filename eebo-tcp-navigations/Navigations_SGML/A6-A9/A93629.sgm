<HEAD>The &s;ub&s;tance of the DECLARATION OF THE Declared King of Scots. Upon the Death of the MARQUES of MONTROSSE, THE Number of his Guard, and the &s;et|ting out of a Fleet from HOLLAND, and another from SPAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEre arived a Ship on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t, which came from St. <HI>Mallowes,</HI> by which we received Intelligence as followeth. The <HI>French</HI> Pyrats do daily much mi&s;chief, not onely to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but al&s;o to the <HI>Hollander</HI> and <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and others which they light upon, they have lately taken two <HI>Marchants</HI> Ships belong|ing to <HI>Genua,</HI> and are become wor&s;e Enemies to Trade then ever the <HI>Dunkerks</HI> were: wherefore the Marchants in the low Countries, are furni&s;hing out a Fleet of twenty
<PB N="2" REF="3">Sale to help to &s;coure the narrow Seas: the like we hear is intended by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and others, and it hath been long expected that our own Countreymen the Marchants of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> would [if po&s;&s;ible] have had the honour of giving the fir&s;t example in this kind.</P>
<P>From <HI>Scotland</HI> we are advertized, that the Cavalier party are extreamly dejected, and even &s;tand amazed at the manner of putting <HI>Montro&s;&s;e</HI> to death, which they chiefly attribute to the leading cen&s;ure of the <HI>Kirk;</HI> they &s;ay that a man de&s;erves &s;ome favour for humanity &s;ake, but that &s;uch a man that for goodline&s;s of per&s;on, and neat de|portment, is not to be paralleld in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould be given up to Satan, and &s;ent &s;uddenly to Hell, without lon|ger time of repentance, hath &s;carce been heard of, yet lea&s;t his temporal puni&s;hment &s;hould not be &s;o great in another world, as he was adjudged to de&s;erve in this: the tortures inflicted on him at his death, were more then ordinary, nei|ther after death could the Kirk with &s;afety ble&s;s that part of his Karke&s;s which was to be buried, and indeed what rea&s;on had they for it; for how knew they what he had eaten, or lay undige&s;ted in his &s;tinking guts and garbage, unfit to be put in their holy con&s;ecrated ground; yet for all this, the Clergy will be reconciled with their King, and &s;ay they will receive him into the bo&s;ome of the kirk; but why may not he fear the &s;ame &s;entence with <HI>Montro&s;&s;e,</HI> if <HI>Montro&s;&s;e</HI> acted by his Commi&s;&s;ion, and had not received any countermand. Notwith&s;tanding their declared King having received Letters, certifying that <HI>Montro&s;&s;e</HI> was dead, declared that he approved thereof, and being told by &s;ome that were about him, that he had lo&s;t one of his be&s;t Servants; he re|plyed that he could not fetch him again, and if he &s;hould &s;hew any di&s;ta&s;t at what had pa&s;t, it was in the power of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to make the Treaty null and void;
<PB N="3" REF="3">by which it appeares, that the life of him who&s;e dependance was the &s;trength of his Princes a&s;surance, is as &s;oone lo&s;t in his affection, as his mi&s;carriage happened in the action, his thoughts being mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e inlarged, and thereby can the ea|&s;ier overlook the fir&s;t election, knowing that no further &s;er|vice can be expected from that in&s;trument, &s;ome think his coming into <HI>Scotland</HI> will be retarded, and its very impro|bable he &s;hould be crowned in <HI>Scotland</HI> the <HI>29.</HI> of May, for &s;ome letters of the <HI>26.</HI> of that moneth &s;ay, that he was then at <HI>Breda,</HI> and had a Guard of about <HI>200.</HI> men attending his per&s;on; in the mean while, the Parliaments Army march this way with an intent [as we heare] to go farther North, they behave them&s;elves very civilly: in&s;omuch, that the Countrey people love them as Brethren, and honour their Commanders, as men mo&s;t exqui&s;ite in ob&s;ervation of good di&s;cipline, they take nothing but what is onely nece&s;|&s;ary for their pre&s;ent &s;u&s;tenance, and are willing to give money for it, and are careful not to give any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, and are frugall in their expences, carrying them|&s;elves as if they coveted no other recompence for their pains then for the glory of doing well. Great cau&s;e there|fore have the Countrey to re&s;pect &s;uch men, which after the mu&s;tering of thou&s;ands of enemies are &s;o well able to go|vern them&s;elves; whereas if the poor Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be ne|ver &s;o much injured, they can revenge them&s;elves no wayes but with teares, [and tho&s;e &s;ometimes prove bitter] but o|thers can do it by Armes.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Wind&s;or.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis day his Excellency the Lord Ge|nerall CROMWEL came to WINSOR, where he was entertained with many vollies of &s;hot, his Lady al&s;o met him here, and many per&s;ons of eminency, Members of Parliament, and of the Councel of State, and chief Officers of the Army; after much time &s;pent in expre&s;sing civil re&s;pects one to ano|ther, and in congratulating his welcome thi|ther, they had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e on the affaires of Ireland, and of the pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s wherewith it hath plea&s;ed God to crown his undertakings. For the carrying on of which work in Ireland, there is Sir Hardres Waller, Collonel Venable, Sir Charles Coot, col. Hew|&s;on, col. Hugh Peters, and many other faithful and de&s;erving Commanders, who both in Valour and Di&s;cipline, will truly imitate the
<PB N="5" REF="4">vertues of their General, till he return thither again. And this is it which all men ought to follow that they hear or &s;ee in others; for as a Learned Man &s;aith, <HI>The race of Men are Men; but the race of Soules are Vertues, and Sanctity.</HI></P>
<P>The Generall had an indifferent good pa&s;|&s;age from Ireland to Bri&s;tol, and was not &s;o Sea-&s;ick, as when he fir&s;t went over thither from Bri&s;tol to Wind&s;or, he came with a &s;mall retinue of his own Servants, and &s;ome few Gentlemen and Officers of the Army, he &s;hews him&s;elf very affable, and courteous unto all, and as time will afford, admitteth a|ny man that hath bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>This Evening came &s;ome part of Collonel Riches Regiment of Hor&s;e, and mo&s;t of the Innes in Town are full of gue&s;ts, which come from London on purpo&s;e to attend him in his way to morrow. They tell us that a great number wil al&s;o meet him by the way, in his pa&s;&s;age to London; but his Lord&s;hip expre&s;|&s;eth much humility, and when any Victory obtained is &s;poken of, he acknowledgeth God to be all in all, and &s;aith, that that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s of God &s;hall &s;tand, but if it be not of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> will come to naught.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>He al&s;o declareth, That it is not &s;utable to his de|&s;ire, to come up to <HI>London</HI> in great Pomp and Glory, yet becau&s;e men would not be thought guilty of that abominable vice of ingratitude, and for that Worthy, deeds are not to be requited with neglect, it may be decent and &s;eemly, for &s;uch as are well-wi&s;hers to the common good, to te&s;tifie their affections this way, which may be done without o&s;tentation in the one, or a&s;cribing more then is due by the other.</P>
