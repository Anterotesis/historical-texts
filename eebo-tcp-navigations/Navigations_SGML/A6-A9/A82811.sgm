<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble Petition and Declaration of the Lords and Commons, a&s;&s;embled in PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;tie,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOur Maje&s;ties mo&s;t loyall Sub|jects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament, cannot conceive that the Declaration which your Ma|je&s;tie received from us at <HI>New|market,</HI> was &s;uch as did de&s;erve that cen&s;ure your Maje&s;tie was plea&s;ed to &s;ay upon us, in that Speech which your Maje&s;tie
<PB N="4" REF="3">made to our Committees there, and &s;ent in writing to both Hou&s;es; our addre&s;&s;e therein being accompanied with plainne&s;&s;e, humility, and faithfulne&s;&s;e, wee thought more proper for removing the di&s;traction of the Kingdome, then if we had then proceeded accor|ding to your Maje&s;ties Me&s;&s;age of the 20. of <HI>Ianuary.</HI> By which your Maje&s;tie was plea&s;ed to de&s;ire, that we would declare what we intended to doe for your Ma|je&s;tie, and what we expected to be done for our &s;elves. In both which we have beene very much hindered by your Maje&s;ties denyall to &s;ecure us and the whole Kingdome, by di&s;po&s;ing the <HI>Militia,</HI> as we had diver&s;e times mo&s;t humbly petitioned, and yet we have not beene altogether negligent of either; having lately made good proceedings in preparing a book of Rates, to be pa&s;&s;ed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poundage: and likewi&s;e the mo&s;t materiall heads of tho&s;e humble de|&s;ires which we intended to make for the good and con|tentment of your Maje&s;tie and your people: but none of the&s;e could be perfected before the Kingdom be put into &s;afety, by &s;etling the <HI>Militia;</HI> And untill your Maje&s;tie &s;hall be plea&s;ed to concurre with your Par|liament in the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things, we hold it impo&s;&s;i|ble for you to give the World or your People &s;uch &s;a|tisfaction concerning the fears and jealou&s;ies which we have expre&s;&s;ed, as we hope your Maje&s;tie hath already received, touching that exception which you were plea&s;ed to take to Ma&s;ter <HI>Pyms</HI> Speech.</P>
<P>As for your Maje&s;ties feares and doubts, the ground whereof is from &s;editious Pamphlets and Sermons, we &s;hall be as carefull to endeavour the removall, as &s;oone as wee &s;hall under&s;tand what Pamphlets and
<PB N="5" REF="3">Sermons are by your Maje&s;tie intended; as we have beene to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any extraordinary concour&s;e of people out of the Citie to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> had the face and &s;hew of tumult and dan|ger in your Maje&s;ties apprehen&s;ion, it will appeare to be cau&s;ed by your Maje&s;ties denyall of &s;uch a guard to your Parliament as they might have cau&s;e to con|fide in, and by taking into White hall &s;uch a Guard for your &s;elfe, as gave ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;ie to the Parliament; and of terrour and offence to your Peo|ple. We &s;eek nothing but your Maje&s;ties Honour, and the peace and pro&s;perity of your Kingdomes. And we are heartily &s;orry we have &s;uch plentifull matter of an an&s;wer to that que&s;tion, Whether you had violated our Laws? We be&s;eech You to remember that the Go|vernment of this Kingdom as it was in a great part man|naged by your Mini&s;ters before the beginning of this Parliament, con&s;i&s;ted of many continued and multi|plied Acts of violation of Lawes, the wounds where|of were &s;carcely healed, when the extremity of all the&s;e violations, was far exceeded by the late &s;trange and unheard of breach of our lawes in the Accu&s;ation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the Commons Hou&s;e, and in the proceedings thereupon: for which we have yet received no full &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>To your Maje&s;ties next que&s;tion, Whether you had denied any Bill for the ea&s;e and &s;ecurity of your Sub|jects, we wi&s;h we could &s;top in the mid&s;t of our an|&s;wer; that with much thankfulne&s;&s;e we acknowledge that your Maje&s;ty hath pa&s;t many good Bils full of contentment, and advantage to your People: But Truth and Nece&s;&s;ity enforceth us to adde this, That
<PB N="6" REF="4">even in or about the time of pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Bils, &s;ome de&s;igne or other had been afoot, which if it had taken effect, would not onely have deprived us of the fruit of tho&s;e Bils, but have reduced us to a wor&s;e conditi|on of confu&s;ion than that wherein the Parliament found us.</P>
<P>And if your Maje&s;ty had asked us the third que&s;ti|on intimated in that Speech, what we had done for your &s;elfe, our an&s;wer would have been much more ea&s;ie, That we have paid two Armies wherewith the Kingdom was burthened la&s;t year; and have under|gone the charge of the war in IRELAND at this time; when through many other exce&s;&s;ive charges and pre&s;&s;ures, whereby your Subjects have been ex|hau&s;ted, and the &s;tocke of the Kingdom very much di|mini&s;hed; which great mi&s;chiefes, and the charges thereupon en&s;uing, have been occa&s;ioned by the evill coun&s;els &s;o powerfull with your Maje&s;ty, which have and will co&s;t this Kingdom more than two millions: all which in ju&s;tice ought to have been borne by your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>As for that free and general pardon your Maje&s;ty hath been plea&s;ed to offer, it can be no &s;ecurity to our feares and jealou&s;ies, for which your Maje&s;ty &s;eemes to propound it; becau&s;e they ari&s;e not from any guilt of our own actions, but from the evill de&s;ignes and attempts of others.</P>
<P>To this our humble An&s;wer to that Speech, we de|&s;ire to adde an information which we lately received from the Deputy Governour of the Merchant Adven|turers at Roterdam in Holland, That an unknown per|&s;on appertaining to the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> did lately &s;olli|cite one <HI>Iames Henly</HI> a Mariner to go to El&s;enore, and
<PB N="7" REF="4">to take charge of a Ship in the Fleet of the King of Denmarke there prepared, which he &s;hould conduct to Hull: in which Fleet likewi&s;e he &s;aid a great Army was to be tran&s;ported. And although we are not apt to give credit to Informations of this nature, yet we can|not altogether thinke it fit to be neglected, but that it may ju&s;tly adde &s;omewhat to the weight of our feares and jealou&s;ies, con&s;idering with what circum&s;tances it is accompanied of the Lord <HI>Dighies</HI> preceding expre&s;|&s;ions in his Letter to her Maje&s;ty, and Sir <HI>Lewis Dives;</HI> and your Maje&s;ties &s;ucceeding cour&s;e of withdrawing your &s;elfe Northward from your Parliament, in a man|ner very &s;utable and corre&s;pondent to that evil coun|&s;el.</P>
<P>Which we doubt will make much deeper impre&s;&s;i|on in the generality of your People. And therefore we mo&s;t humbly advi&s;e and be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty for the procuring and &s;etling the Confidence of your Parlia|ment and all your Subjects, and for the other important rea&s;ons concerning the recovery of Ireland and &s;ecu|ring this Kingdom, which have been formerly pre|&s;ented to your Maje&s;ty, you will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed with all convenient &s;peed to returne to the&s;e parts, and to clo&s;e with the Coun&s;ell and de&s;ire of your Parlia|ment: where you &s;hall finde their dutifull affections and endeavours, ready to attend your Maje&s;ty with &s;uch entertainment, as &s;hall not onely give your Ma|je&s;ty ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;ecurity in their faithfulne&s;&s;e; but other manifold evidences of their earne&s;t intentions and endeavours to advance your Maje&s;ties &s;ervice, ho|nour and contentment; and to e&s;tabli&s;h it upon the &s;ure foundation of the peace and pro&s;perity of all your Kingdomes.</P>
