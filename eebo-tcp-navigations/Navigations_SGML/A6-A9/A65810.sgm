<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Native Commodities.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THeir Fruits are Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries, and Cidern like a Muskmelon, but more &s;weet and plea|&s;ant, Cucumbers, Goords, Ra&s;ps, Strawberries, and Hurtil|berries, and many other Berries in Woods and Hedges.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P N="2">2. Their Grain is Wheat, Rye, Barly, Oats, Pea&s;e, Buck|way, I&s;nythu, a grain like Rice, which they &s;ell at three pence a bu&s;helmo&s;t commonly, unle&s;s rather by rea&s;on of the No|bilities monopoly then the Earths barrenne&s;s, there happen|eth a dearth, and then their Corn is twenty pence a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P N="1">1. But the Commodities wherewith they enrich them|&s;elves, and plea&s;ure other Countries, is, fir&s;t Furrs of all &s;orts, as Buck, Fox, Sables, Dun Fur, Mortrones, Ermines, Miniver, Bever, Wulverin, Squirrel, whereof there is tran&s;ported out of the Countrey by the Merchants of <HI>Turky</HI> and Chri&s;ten|dome to the value of &s;even hundred thou&s;and Rubbels.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Commodity is Honey, whereof be&s;ides an exceeding great quantity &s;pent in their ordinary drinks, which is <HI>Mead</HI> of all &s;orts, and other u&s;es, a good quantity is carried out of the Countrey to the neighbouring parts which have need of it: God hath not given <HI>all Commodities</HI> to one, to elate it with pride, and none to other Countries, to deject them with pen&s;ivene&s;s, but there is &s;ome kind of equallity between the profits of Countries, to continue Commerce and ballance Trade in &s;ome proportion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Commodity is Wax, whereof there hath been tran&s;ported a millions worth abroad: this Wax is the cask, where Honey is the liquour, and being yellow by Na|ture, is by Art made white and green; for &s;ight the cleare&s;t, for &s;mell the &s;weete&s;t, for touch the cleanlie&s;t; u&s;eful in Law to &s;eal In&s;truments; in Phy&s;ick to mollifie Sinews, ripen and di&s;&s;olue Ulcers; the ground of all Searcloaths, called &s;o from <HI>Cera</HI> Wax: Here are Lakes of Honey found in hollow trees; and Combes eight foot long: the Heaths have the wor&s;t Honey, and the Champion the be&s;t: the finer the Wheat and the Wool, the poorer the Honey: the be&s;t Ho|ney is lowe&s;t in the ve&s;&s;el: <HI>The be&s;t Oyl is at top, the be&s;t Wine in the middle, and the be&s;t Honey is in the bottome:</HI> It
<PB N="6" REF="5">opneeth Ob&s;tructions, cleareth the Brea&s;ts of tho&s;e humours that fall down from the Head, loo&s;eneth the Belly, and hath other good qualities not to be reckoned in a Winters day.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth Commodity is Cow-hides; <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t &s;hute was of leaves, his &s;econd of leather. It is a common ob|&s;ervation, that when Wheat is dear Leather is cheap; and when Leather is dear, Wheat is cheap: their Lo&s;h or Buffe|hide is large and fair; their Bull or Cow-hide (for they have no Oxen nor Weathers) is &s;mall; there hath been tran&s;ported by Merchants an hundred thou&s;and Hides.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth is their Meath, a drink made of Water, Ho|ney, and other Ingredients mo&s;t whol&s;ome for Mans body: <HI>Pollio</HI> being an hundred yeares old, and asked by <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> by what meanes e&s;pecially he had &s;o long pre&s;erved his vigour both of mind and body, an&s;wered, <HI>Intus mul&s;o, foris Oleo, By taking Metheglin inward, and Oyl outward.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixt Commodity is Tallow, whereof they tran|&s;port a great weight; their pa&s;turage being &s;o good, their fa&s;ts &s;o many, and their u&s;e of Tallow &s;o little; there hath been &s;hipped of this commodity two millions worth to for|reign parts.</P>
<P N="7">7. As their Bea&s;ts fat yeilds them the &s;ixt, &s;o their Fi&s;h the &s;eventh Commodity; <HI>viz.</HI> Train-oyl, which they draw out of the Seale-fi&s;h, the Sturgeon, the Sterledey, the Sevengu, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they take thus; before Winter they leave their Boats near the Bay of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and at Spring they come and find the fi&s;h haunt and &s;holes, and &s;o environ them and kill them by force, giving warning to all the Companies by firing a Beacon when they have di&s;covered a haunt.</P>
<P N="8">8. Their eighth Commodity is Sturgeon and other Sea|fi&s;h, caught in tho&s;e Northern Seas in abundance: the little head and Swines back is the &s;ign that the&s;e fi&s;h are in &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P N="9">9 The ninth Commodity is Flaxe and Hempe, which hath amounted to 800000. yearly, this is &s;old for cordage, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for us, that it is a common Proverbe when Hempe is &s;pun, then <HI>England</HI> is done; when all that nece&s;&s;ary Commodity is employed &s;o that there is no more left for Sailes and Cordages, <HI>England</HI> (who&s;e &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in Shipping) would be reduced to a wofull <HI>condition;</HI> and I wonder there is not more Hempe &s;owed among us &s;ince our Land affords &s;o much &s;trong and deep ground proper for the &s;ame; here is excellent Flaxe which well husbanded would find Linnen for the Rich, and living for the Poor.</P>
<P N="10">10 Their tenth Commodity is Salt, their be&s;t Salt is a <HI>Stararou&s;e</HI> in very great quantity, where they have great &s;tore of Salt-wells about 200 miles from the Sea; at <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> Salt is made naturally by the Sea water ca&s;ting it up in heapes, and &s;o it is digged down, and carried away by the Merchants; this is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to mans livelyhood, without which nei|ther Sacrifice was <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to God, nor meate &s;avory <HI>to man,</HI> it is placed on the Board with bread, to &s;hew that they are equally nece&s;&s;ary to mans &s;u&s;tinance; and it is ob&s;erved that,</P>
<P N="1">1 Some Countryes have Salt without fle&s;h within many miles, as in the South part of <HI>Africa;</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Some have plenty of Fle&s;h but no Salt to make u&s;e thereof, as in many parts of <HI>Tartary;</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 Some have Fle&s;h and Salt, but the Fle&s;h utterly uncapable of &s;ea&s;oning as at <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 Some have Fle&s;h and Salt but the Salt &s;o dear
<PB N="10" REF="6">that common people cannot compa&s;&s;e it as in <HI>France;</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 Some have Fle&s;h, caple of Salt, and Salt at an ea&s;y rate as they in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and we in <HI>England, Foelices bona &s;i &s;ua norint.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="10">10. The tenth Commodity is Tarre which they make out of their Firre Trees, in the Country of <HI>Du|yna</HI> and <HI>Smolex&s;ho,</HI> whereof much is &s;ent abroad.</P>
<P N="11">11. The leventh Commodity is Oake, when the Spies were &s;ent into the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> among other in&s;tructions given them, they had order to make enqui|ry whether there was Wood therein or not, this Coun|try affordeth abundance of Wood, excellent for Ship|ping and other u&s;es.</P>
<P N="12">12 The twelfth Commodity is <HI>Barley</HI> white large plumpe and full of Flower, it is (though not &s;o tooth|&s;ome) yet as whole&s;ome as Wheat it &s;elfe, and was all the &s;taffe of Bread which <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> Body leaned upon all his life, eating to atte&s;t his Humanity, <HI>Barley loaves</HI> to evince his humility.</P>
<P N="13">13 The next Commodity is Diamonds in black|ne&s;&s;e and hardne&s;&s;e for &s;hort of the <HI>Indian,</HI> yet &s;et with a good foile (advantaged hypocri&s;ie pa&s;&s;eth often for &s;incerity) may at the fir&s;t &s;ight deceive no unskilfull lapidary, as their lu&s;tre is le&s;&s;e then Orient Diamonds, &s;o herein they exceed them that nature hath made both their face and their dre&s;&s;e by whom they are pointed and poli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="14">14 Amber-gree&s;e &s;o precious a Commodity as is fixed to no place in the World, as too great a trea&s;ure for any one Country to engro&s;&s;e, and therefore it is only fluctuating and ca&s;ually found by &s;mall parcells,
<PB N="11" REF="6">&s;ometimes in one place, &s;ometimes in another, yet much of it is found upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> it's by &s;ome thought to be the &s;perme of a Fi&s;h; by others the royling of &s;ea water; by others a gumme growing on the &s;ea &s;hore, however it is very refre&s;hing for the &s;pirits, and Soveraign for the &s;trengthning of the Head, be&s;ides the mo&s;t fragrant &s;cent, for &s;tronger in con&s;ort, when compounded with other things, then when &s;ingly it &s;elfe.</P>
<P N="15">15 The fifteenth Commodity is Metall which of all &s;orts is found with much ado in the&s;e parts e&s;peci|ally Iron and it's elder brother &s;teel extracted from the &s;ame Oare, differing from it not in kind but in degree of purity as being the fir&s;t running thereof, it's more hard and brittle then the Metalls of other Countryes.</P>

The people are ignorant, that they may be more fit to be Slaves: Therefore in the year 1643 they removed all &s;trangers to the borders, lea&s;t they &s;hould teach the people better Manners, Quallities, and more Wit. And none is to a&s;pire higher then his Fathers Trade.</P>
