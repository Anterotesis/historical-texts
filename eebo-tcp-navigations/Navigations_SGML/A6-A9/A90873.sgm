<PB N="2" REF="3">his Honour would declare his intention, in regard I heard a rumour he would make a Ce&s;&s;ation with the Iri&s;h, which I prote&s;ted again&s;t, and that if he did, I would block up all his Harbours, my Letter obtain|ing no An&s;wer, till his return to <HI>Cork,</HI> in his way home at <HI>Mayall</HI> his actions produced this inclo&s;ed, up|on which I took Order for &s;hipping, to lye in all his Harbor mouthes, and declared my be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccour, to my utmo&s;t power to all, whether Officers, Souldiers, or others, that would de&s;ert him, two dayes &s;ince he &s;ent me leave to &s;end to the Gentlemen in pri|&s;on, which I &s;uddenly did, and ye&s;terday received two Letters, one from Colonell <HI>Temple,</HI> the other from Sir <HI>William Fenton,</HI> the latter of which de&s;ires me to impart to your Honour his reque&s;t, that you would be plea&s;ed to mediate to &s;ome of the honoura|ble Hou&s;es of Parliament, that a Letter may be &s;ent from them to my Lord <HI>Inchequin,</HI> de&s;iring his tran&s;|mitting the impri&s;oned Gentlemen into <HI>England,</HI> to receive their triall there, which he de&s;ires you to be mindfull of.

<HEAD>THE <HI>Declaration of &s;everall eminent Commanders, late of the Army commanded by the Lord</HI> INCHEQUIN.</HEAD>
<P>IN obedience and difcharge of our tru&s;t to the Par|liament of <HI>England,</HI> &s;itting at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> we give this information under our hands, to be pre&s;ented to them, which wee &s;hall be ready to make good in our per&s;ons upon oath, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lord Baron of <HI>Inchequin</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> having been abroad with &s;ome part of his Army, whereof we are members: Did upon the third of this moneth upon his returne home, being at <HI>May|alle</HI> &s;end for us, who have hitherto &s;ub&s;cribed to appeare pre&s;ently before at his Quarters, which be|ing performed, and all of us a&s;&s;embled together in his pre&s;ence Chamber: His Lord&s;hip declared this unto us, that in order to the Nationall Covenant, and to that particular branch thereof, which concerns the re-inve&s;ting His Maje&s;ty in his Thron: he had with the advice of his Officers taken a re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent pretended Parliament in <HI>England:</HI> who were forced by an Independent faction, they having broken all Oathes and Covenants, which they had made both to God and Man: and to that purpo&s;e, was now puting him&s;elfe into a po&s;ture of defence: And that for the managing of this De&s;igne, he had corre&s;pondency with the King, with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="4">generally all the Presbyterian party that were agreed with the King: who were re&s;olved to endeavour to their utmo&s;t the re-inthroning the King, and re&s;tor|ing a free Parliament, which hee fully declared this not to be: And for the better effecting and carrying on this De&s;igne, he was re&s;olved to joyne with the Lord <HI>Taff,</HI> and the whole <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> of the Province of <HI>Mun|&s;tor:</HI> who have a&s;&s;ured him of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both with their per&s;ons and e&s;tates, and that he had now &s;ent for us, who were onely the &s;u&s;pected party of the Army to report this to us, and to require of us our re&s;olution whether wee all would comply with him in this or no: To which we an&s;werd, We &s;tood for the King and Parliament, as we had ever done, up|on which he required us not to juggle with him, but to declare whether it was this pre&s;ent Parliament wee meant, for he &s;aid the truth was, they did not acknow|ledge this to be a Parliament: To which we an&s;wered his Lord&s;hip, we could not comply with him: He &s;till u&s;ing many aggravations, to make good what hee had &s;aid again&s;t them, and further &s;aid, Hee ho|ped to &s;ee this pre&s;ent Parliament laid flat on their backs by <HI>Michaclmas</HI> day, and that this was no ra&s;h re&s;olution, but a premeditated action, he being con|fident, that let it come to the wor&s;t it could, yet in &s;pight of all, he would be able to procure good terms both for him&s;elfe and the re&s;t that adhered to him: and that which induced him cheifly to put it in pra|ctice at pre&s;ent was, that he was now a&s;&s;ured, he was before hand with the Independent party, which hee never was before; yet hee had thought for &s;ome time longer to have forborne his declaring, but yet &s;ome &s;u&s;pitions, the Vice admirall Captaine <HI>John
<PB N="5" REF="4">Crowther</HI> had of him; could not permit him to car|ry it private any longer, in regard the &s;aid Captain <HI>Crowther</HI> had prote&s;ted again&s;t him, and blockt up his Harbours. And his Lord&s;hip did further declare, that al which would not joyn with him in this de&s;ign, he required them to depart and go for <HI>England,</HI> for that he would not permit any neare him, or in his Army, that would not faithfully comply with him in his intention; and as a motive to induce us to joyn with him, he informed us that he was certainly a&s;&s;ur|ed, that Collonell <HI>Jones</HI> had by order from the Par|liament of <HI>England,</HI> made a ce&s;&s;ation with <HI>Owen Roe Oneal,</HI> and that faction; who cho&s;e rather to enter into League with the Parliament then with the King: and in this re&s;pect hee would now joyne with the Lord <HI>Taffe,</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> forces again&s;t the other.
