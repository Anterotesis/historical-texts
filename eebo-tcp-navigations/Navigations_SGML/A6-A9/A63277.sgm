<P>THat the Imperial and Poli&s;h Armies having repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> on a Bridg of Boats at <HI>Wi&s;war</HI> near <HI>Comorra,</HI> the King of <HI>Foland</HI> re|&s;olved to advance with his Troops to Attack the Fort of <HI>Barkan,</HI> which covers the Bridg of <HI>Gran;</HI> accordingly his Maje&s;ty marched on the &s;eventh of this Month, with &s;o great Diligence, that he got a German mile and a half before the Imperiali&s;ts. and being come near the &s;aid Fort, he cau&s;|ed his Dragoons to alight, and to attack it, purpo&s;ing to take it by a&s;|&s;ault; The Turks at the fir&s;t came out in &s;mall Parties from behind their Retrenchments, to draw the Chri&s;tians on; The Poli&s;h Dragoons behaved them&s;elves very bravely, and the Turks gave ground, but it was onely to amu&s;e the Chri&s;tians, for in the mean time <HI>Five</HI> or <HI>Six Thou&s;and</HI> Jani&s;aries, pas&s;ing behind a Hill, Fell upon the Chri&s;tians, who had not percieved them, in their Flank, and put them into confu&s;ion, the Regiment of the Grand Mare&s;chal Jablounski particularly &s;uffering very much. The Duke of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|rain</HI> who marched with his Hors, the Imperial Infantry being &s;ix miles. be|hind, knew not that the King was advanced &s;o far, till his Maje&s;ty &s;ent him word that he was engaged with the Enemy, and de&s;ired him to Ad|vance without any lo&s;s of time; His Highne&s;s therupon Marched with all the &s;peed he was able, but having a Defile to pa&s;s, he could not joyn the King &s;o &s;oon as otherwi&s;e he might have done. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ap|pearing with the fir&s;t Squadrons, the Poles retreated to meet him, to avoid the great di&s;order which they began to fall into; and the German Dragoons hav|ving joyned the Poles, they returned to charge the Enemy, who not being now able to maintain their ground, retired with &s;ome lo&s;s. That in this action twelve or thirteen hundred Poles were &s;lain, and among them a Palatin. That the King him&s;elf was in great danger. and his Son Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> being engaged among the forwarde&s;t, had his Hors killed under him. That on the eighth they ex|pected the Imperial Infantry would come up, and that on the ninth the King and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> had re&s;olved to attack the Fort of <HI>Barkan,</HI> which they believed would occa&s;ion a very &s;harp Engagement.</P>
