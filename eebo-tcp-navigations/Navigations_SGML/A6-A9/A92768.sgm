<P>WIll it not be imagined that the&s;e But|ter box Flemings are enfatuated for their weighing Anchor, and hoi&s;ing their Sails towards <HI>England,</HI> to doe Pennance there for their brethrens mi&s;demeanors at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and to pay an after-rec|koning for the once Cautionary Towns? As al&s;o to be talkt withall concerning the Fi&s;hing in that Sea, which without the permi&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h Nation, mu&s;t be to them <HI>Mare clau&s;um,</HI> and not <HI>Liberum,</HI> not|with&s;tanding late <HI>Grotius</HI> his opinion and Rethorick. Be&s;ides, all the due af-recknings, and liquidations for &s;everall injuries, depradations, detentions, &s;poils and the like. Truly, it &s;eems to me a meer riddle (I &s;ay) why tho&s;e wi&s;e and grave States-men, who have &s;o manfully with-&s;tood the <HI>Don Deigos de matta-mores,</HI> and all the power of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> adherents; &s;hould be induced to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to any other law &s;ave the Cannon? And why they &s;hould not make u&s;e of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> (that &s;econd commodious <HI>Algier</HI> Pi|rats Ne&s;t) whence they might have lanched forth Squadrons of Fire-&s;hips on the Engli&s;h-fleets, and might have taken the opportunities of Winds, Tides,

<P>Why not? <HI>Canutus</HI> the Dane did once do the like before, for all the &s;hips watcht that Rode in the River: And what did not tho&s;e States Admiral <HI>Hem&s;|kerck</HI> attempt and goe through within the Bay, and under the Fort of <HI>Gibraltar?</HI></P>

<P>I marry: And why &s;hould not they blow up the &s;hips on the coa&s;t, by &s;uch a like engine, as <HI>Corne|lius Drebbell</HI> invented? which was to &s;wim betwixt two waters; and the which is practi&s;ed by too many wicked men in this age. It is apparent that the Common-wealth of <HI>England</HI> is as &s;ubtile as <HI>Jacob:</HI> But why &s;hould the Hoghen Mogen &s;ell their Birth|right? For (I pray you) what would the Engli&s;h get by a breach, nought &s;ave blows?</P>

<P>By a Peace with the Hoghen Mogens, I con|fe&s;&s;e the Engli&s;h will have made ju&s;t &s;uch a Fea&s;t as the Fox and Crane did; and it would be but accord|ing to the Dutch old &s;aying; They would &s;hear the Sheep, and leave the &s;hearing of the Hogs to the <HI>Hol|landers.</HI> But &s;ince they have bought up all the <HI>We&s;t|phalia</HI> bacon (to make fire-&s;hips withall) they will be &s;uch gue&s;ts unto the Engli&s;h, as <HI>Samp&s;ons</HI> Foxes were to the <HI>Phili&s;tines;</HI> for that they would be &s;oon con&s;trained to change their entertainment: They may therefore amu&s;e the Engli&s;h with a pratie, or a tale in a Tub; that &s;o while&s;t they are a fea&s;ting on Cu&s;tards and Bag puddings, the Butter-box-Flem|mings may have time to buy up all the Pitch, Tar and Ma&s;ts, from the frozen parts; that &s;o in the mean while their land&s;men may get off their goods.</P>

<SP>

<P>Nor do I; for that I am fully per&s;waded, in ca&s;e the Engli&s;h agree not with them; they will as then have had time enough to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of all &s;uch things, whereof the Engli&s;h &s;tand in need; and the pre&s;ent want whereof would for ever make the Eng|li&s;h uncapable to &s;upply, and make good their Fleets.</P>

<P>And they mu&s;t expect as afore&s;aid to meet nought &s;ave blows: For that <HI>Kees</HI> knele&s;&s;en will fall too his Sable-cutter, and his <HI>Grave&s;and</HI> Chee&s;e buck|ler, and will pay it home with a <HI>Te meer den hoop te meer &s;miit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ick daer doot,</HI> the more in number, the more I &s;hall be &s;ure to kill; for in a word, it is but too appear, that in ca&s;e the Engli&s;h be let alone, they will become &s;o mighty, as that they will en|force Laws on others, and that new Laws too; do we not already &s;ee that they &s;peak in a known lan|guage, and not at all in heathen greek? The <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> have hitherto &s;aid, <HI>Striike ende &s;et;</HI> but the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> will &s;trike at the be&s;t of the traffiques, profits, and &s;o &s;et out laws for their Neighbours?

<P>The Duke <HI>d' Alva,</HI> the Cardinal <HI>Gramvel,</HI> and <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> were the cau&s;es thereof, by their cruel &amp; tyrannical forcing of the con&s;ciences of men; by their entrenching on the Liberties, Lives, and E|&s;tates of every rational breathing &s;oul among&s;t them. For my part, if I were to determin this ca&s;e, I would have the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;tand it out at any rate, &s;ince of all
<PB N="4" REF="4"> Nations that ever made wars, they alone have enrich|ed them&s;elves thereby: Now &s;uppo&s;e the Engli&s;h be at Peace with them, why as then they will &s;weep away all the profits of the traffique? But if the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> &s;tand it out, it will remain theirs; and they will likewi&s;e have a concour&s;e of all the be&s;t Engli&s;h Sea|men, who affect the Royall Party; be&s;ides, the <HI>French, Danes,</HI> and who not? All which will be <HI>Striike ende Set,</HI> with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, me thinks your di&s;cour&s;e &s;avours much of an Arch-fire-brand; and not as that of one who &s;hould have learned to practi&s;e the <HI>Hollanders</HI> too ancient main &s;ayings, viz. <HI>Houdt va&s;t ende beleght;</HI> that is, hold fa&s;t and contrive: Secondly, <HI>Het is goet met een ghe&s;ondeheigt te bedde te gaen;</HI> it is good &s;leeping in a whole skin. And as for the Hoghen Mogens, they are wi&s;e, and know by a long experience, what Nation is be&s;t to live in peace withall; &s;o likewi&s;e do they know, that Saw-du&s;t and Sand cannot make good Morter; Even &s;o, any Nation that is of a con|trary Religion cannot compo&s;e &s;o firm an amity, but they will alwayes be &s;ubject to change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kit.</SPEAKER>
<P>What talke&s;t thou of Religion? that's a pretty toy indeed to reflect on in this age: would not many at the pre&s;ent &s;ay as an eminent Per&s;on during the la&s;t Baricadoes of <HI>Paris</HI> did, to wit, <HI>Le Dieu de ces temps &s;ont de venu trop vieux ill en fault Mouler d'autres;</HI> That the gods of tho&s;e times (meaning the &s;tone idols in the Papi&s;ts Churches) were become &s;o old, as that they needed to be new moulded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray you interrupt me not; I have not &s;topt you in your carreare: The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> I &s;ay, are well acquainted with the power of the Engli&s;h Nati|on, both by Land and Sea.</P>

<P>By Land! they are fierce blades indeed, and a plain knock-down, pell-mell, is their greate&s;t skill, as Count <HI>Harcourt</HI> ob&s;erved of them; as long as they might lie in beds, have their good-ale at their No&s;es, and their Night-caps on their heads; &s;o likewi&s;e hath experience manife&s;ted their great exploits at Sea, viz. <HI>Cales</HI> and <HI>Rochell.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, but the&s;e are old &s;tories; that was a fooling age, wherein men and their followers were charmed by love toyes; even as <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> his men were by <HI>Circes.</HI> The Engli&s;h pre&s;ent warriours, think more on the lay|ing of their enemies in the du&s;t then of powdering their haires; they fight and pray, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did.</P>

<P>In this kinde, you &s;eem to talk of Saints, but I pray you, doth not the world conceive the contrary of &s;ome of them?</P>

<P>Puf! the world is a Fools-cap; there is no gold without &s;ome dro&s;&s;e, before it be &s;even-times refined.</P>

<P>I, but when will that be, at Doom&s;day think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I be&s;eech you let me proceed, (and &s;top your fierd-brand vain) Do not the Engli&s;h as they lye in their beds, &s;ee through their Windows the Hol|landers fleet &s;ailing too and again along their Coa&s;ts? Were not the Hollanders con&s;trained to advi&s;e their Indian Squadrons to &s;aile about; when the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of <HI>Amboina</HI> was fir&s;t reported? May they not be taken every where, and every day? Have the Hoghen Moghen &s;o many Shires of firm ground as the Engli&s;h? And whereon Nations may live happily, and may make the Seas the parting-wals
<PB N="6" REF="5"> betwixt that great Nation, that careth not whe|ther any come among&s;t them or no? In <HI>England</HI> all the Elements are good, among the Dutch all the Ele|ments are bad; the Engli&s;h have within them&s;elves what&s;oever they need; the Dutch have nothing of all they want, &s;ave Butter, Chee&s;e and Fi&s;h. And for all the fire-brand-like expre&s;&s;ions of the firing of Fleets at Sea, in Ports and Harbours, nay, the very Stairs of <HI>London</HI> Bridge Tavern; though it be granted that all the Canon &s;hot from the Block-hou&s;es at <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> &s;hould doe no harm again&s;t &s;uch Barks as might take the opportunity of Windes, and Tides, and dark nights; though Men-of-war riding on the River, and be lovingly linkt together with Cable-bracelets, &s;hould not be capable to hinder the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;uch Boats no more then the Damiaten chains could im|pedite the <HI>Belgians</HI> fetching away of the &s;ilver Bells which are at <HI>Harlem:</HI> Finally, &s;uppo&s;e that men &s;hould be &s;o moapi&s;h as to believe the old &s;tories which Mother <HI>Shipton</HI> recounted in a Chimney-cor|ner, or &s;uch like which Almanack makers have di|vulged on the &s;ame &s;core, when as they wanted mony to clear tho&s;e which they had made in Ale-hou&s;es and Tobaco-&s;hops. In the mean while, I pray, have not the Engli&s;h Bacon to make Fire-&s;hips withall, as well as the Hollanders? can they not make u&s;e of <HI>Drebbels</HI> or &s;uch like inventions, to drive between two waters, and to get under any of their adver&s;e parties &s;hips? And when as you talke of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> cannot the Eng|li&s;h &s;top up that Harbour, or any other they &s;hall have a minde unto? As it was intended, during the late breach between <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Really, I am of an opinion, that neither the Engli&s;h nor the
<PB N="7" REF="5"> Dutch will be &s;o far over&s;hot in the true principles of State, as to be diverted by bravado's, far le&s;&s;e by &s;care|crows; <HI>viz.</HI> the pretended impo&s;sibility of an a|greement betwixt them; The General States may ever remember their own &s;aying, <HI>Concordia res parvae cre&s;cunt, magna dilabuntur;</HI> they have done well, wi&s;e|ly, and like them&s;elves in going for <HI>England,</HI> where they may try what may be done in a friendly way: when as the Engli&s;h will al&s;o doubtle&s;&s;e be &s;o wi&s;e as to remember the Scripture &s;aying, viz. <HI>Beati pacifici,</HI> and to accept of po&s;&s;ibilities, as well as of conveni|encies. Moreover, I am confident that this will fall out according to the Marquis of <HI>Spinola's</HI> u&s;ual &s;ay|ing, who was of an opinion, that Treaties ought ne|ver to be refu&s;ed, viz. <HI>Entretenemos &agrave; e&s;&s;a platica;</HI> let us entertain this parley: &s;o likewi&s;e, doe the Dutch al&s;o &s;ay, <HI>Tu&s;chen loven ende bieden, vergaederen end ver|eenighen de lieden,</HI> between asking and bidding chap|men a&s;&s;emble and agree: The rigour of the law, (it is true) demands the life, but the Judge doth for the mo&s;t part &s;uffer the party to be freed by a more ea&s;ie &s;atisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kit.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems then that you minde an agreement, and not to &s;ay as the French, <HI>viz. Il fait bon pe&s;cher en eau trouble,</HI> Its good fi&s;hing in muddy water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly I ever minded, it according unto the Italian &s;aying, <HI>Qui pi&s;&s;a chara gaba el medico,</HI> He that makes clear water may laugh at the Phy&s;itian. I did ever endeavour to per&s;wade all men to agree, and when as I found parties to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and at &s;uch an enmity together, as that it was requi&s;ite to u&s;e art in the reconciling of them, as then I endea|voured to deceive them both by a lawfull &s;tratagem, onely to make them friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Kit.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how could you make that good, &s;ince de|ceits is alwayes to be abhorred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deceit in &s;uch like punctilo's is not only law|full but very nece&s;&s;ary; as for example, When a <HI>Span|yard</HI> is to be treated withall, he mu&s;t be made believe (by rea&s;on of his haughty humour and high &s;pirit) that his adver&s;e party &s;eeks him: And truly, the Ho|ghen Moghen, (be it &s;poken without offence) were &s;o well acquainted with their own &s;trength, as that they would hardly have been induced to yeeld unto a parley with the Spanyards, had they not been made to believe that <HI>Speck-John</HI> (as they call the Spanyard) was out of breath; and were glad to lay their heads, as it were, on the block: To in&s;tance herein, I &s;hall only alledge the effects of &s;ome words, which unfortu|nately were uttered by the Chancellour of <HI>Brabant, Peckius,</HI> in a Speech which he had intended to make unto the General States, at the expiration of their twelve years Truce; when as he onely &s;aid thus, viz. <HI>That it was conceived, tho&s;e States had as then had time enough to bethink them&s;elves, whether or no, it were not fit for them to reunite them&s;elves with the King of</HI> Spain. At which very words, the A&s;&s;embly ro&s;e, interrupted his &s;peech, and rejected the Treaty; Declaring unto the &s;aid <HI>Peckius,</HI> that all the favour they could &s;hew unto him, was to &s;ave him from the Turff-wives rage at <HI>Delft,</HI> as he pa&s;t through that place in his journey homewards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kit.</SPEAKER>
<P>According unto your computation therefore, the Hoghen Moghen and Engli&s;h mu&s;t needs agree; for you would as I perceive have the one to offer fair, and the other to take le&s;&s;e, and thereby gull all the fire-brands what&s;oever: a match it mu&s;t needs be to
<PB N="9" REF="6"> your thinking, but &s;ay you &s;o? why as then for all this the Hollanders will be too hard for the Engli&s;h how&s;oever.</P>

</SP>

<P>What I urge &s;tands with common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, and I will make it good.</P>

<P>I &s;hall laugh at that heartily.</P>

<P>They may agree, that I grant you; and re|main in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s Pottage to boot: and yet neverthele&s;&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;hall never attain unto tho&s;e advantages which the Hollanders po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould wonder if you could clear me that point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall ea&s;ily doe it, and though I may prove to be very plain with you; yet you &s;hall finde that I &s;hall &s;trike home to the marrow: therefore do but ob&s;erve what I &s;hall relate unto you, <HI>viz.</HI> The old Princes of <HI>Orange, William, Maurice,</HI> and <HI>Frederick Hen|drick,</HI> (that compleat number of admirable Patriots) who having taken a &s;urvey of the united States Gene|ral affairs, pitcht at fir&s;t on tho&s;e expedients, where|by they might make them Potent, Rich, and Secure for ever; which they effected, and gained the peoples love to boot: Fir&s;t, by their &s;ettling of the publique Security, or Faith; and &s;econdly, by the reducing of the value of monies; and in this manner they &s;ecu|red them&s;elves, and attracted all Nations; I &s;ay, all Nations, and not &s;o onely, but their Sub&s;tances and Stocks to boot. Moreover, they &s;etled a Record Of|fice, whereby they prevented all kinde of cheats and deceits what&s;oever, either in Sales, Tran&s;actions, or Morgages, and whereby they al&s;o got in a little &s;pace of time many millions of pounds in ready monies, as
<PB N="10" REF="7"> al&s;o a con&s;iderable yearly revenue, and the love of all men. They permitted Liberty of Con&s;cience, the contrarys whereof lo&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI> tho&s;e &s;aid Province. They e&s;tabli&s;hed Banks of Loan, and of Sale, whereby all needy per&s;ons were relieved; they thereby abolli&s;hed and extirpated all Lombards and Jewi&s;h Brokers, who (as the Engli&s;h U&s;urers do) take 30, 40, and more <HI>per Cent.</HI> U&s;e, and who gave &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive rates for money, as that none could be had at any rea&s;onable condition. They e&s;tabli&s;hed a Bank of payment, whereby the credits of all Negotiants was rai&s;ed. They impo&s;ed ea&s;ie cu&s;toms on all man|ner of Importations and Exportations by Forreigners; like unto the French, who permitted &s;trangers to ex|port their Salt for eight &s;hillings the Bu&s;hel, when as the Natives pay foure pounds &s;terling for the &s;ame. And by the&s;e means they reduced the valuation of monies, and its U&s;e unto 3, and 4, <HI>per Cent.</HI> whereby they got &s;uch a va&s;t &s;tock of monies, as that they were able to buy and &s;ell all kinde of Wares at far better rates then any other Nations could doe. And the&s;e are the main cau&s;es, why the Engli&s;h, nor any other Nation what&s;oever, &s;hall not be able to out-vie them, by rea&s;on that they are not in a capacity to equall them therein: Be&s;ides, their thriftine&s;&s;e in manning their &s;hips with a le&s;&s;e number of men then others, &amp; al&s;o their more &s;paringnes in Dyet. And as by the&s;e cour&s;es they have made them&s;elves potent, rich, and &s;ecure: &s;o have they al&s;o from time to time made u&s;e of &s;everal main advantages, which were not &s;o much reflected on by others; nay, which is wor&s;e, willfully neglected: Ha! <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> Ha! <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> for having gotten the hand of the Engli&s;h in the Cloth

<P>_WHo of us three, I pray, &s;hall prove him|&s;elf to be the wi&s;e&s;t? and reflect on a Gig, which was acted by the <HI>Harlemmers</HI> Rhe|toricians: Whenas a &s;ingle man appear|ing on the &s;tage, uttered his minde in this &s;en&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> Three and five is nine, which he con|tinually reiterated as he walked up and down; a while after, a merry Grig &s;tarts forth at the other end of the Stage, and &s;aith thus; To meddle with no|thing, is be&s;t; and the&s;e two might happily have re|mained uninterrupted till this very day, had not a third party interpo&s;ed; &amp; hearing the fir&s;t mans note, that three and five was nine; he endeavoured to per|&s;wade him, that he was in an error; for that to all mens knowledge, three and five were but eight: At which the five and third man being di&s;plea&s;ed, and falling into a rage, &s;eeing him&s;elf thus abruptly controled, he gave the other (who endeavoured to rectifie him) a &s;ound box on the Ear, &s;aying, that's nine with a ven|geance, at which our third party capered to &s;ome tune
<PB N="2" REF="16"> laughing heartily and repeating his fir&s;t le&s;&s;on <HI>viz. To meddle with nothing is be&s;t;</HI> Whereas the affirming party was &s;ufficientiy a&s;hamed, and the a&s;&s;embly not a little plea&s;ed: As al&s;o all bu&s;ie bodies, partly in&s;tru|cted; carrying &s;o emphaticall a le&s;&s;on away with them, <HI>viz.</HI> How that, <HI>to meddle with nothing, was the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t way.</HI></P>

<P>Thou hinte&s;t very well; and if &s;o be that Meddle with all-party, had performed his part on the Old Exchange: Marry as then, he would have learned more wi&s;dome, then to &s;pread brags of the buying of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and all the <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> bacon: As if we Engli&s;h were children, and to be &s;cared by &s;uch a mock-&s;how, and could not make fire-&s;hips as well as our neighbours: nay, as if we wanted Spades and Pick-axes, to levell your Hont&s;bo&s;ch, your Ca|dykes, and your Slapers; and to make the Sea over|run all thy Country.</P>

<P>I would have you know, that we Sea-Captains are as wi&s;e as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was, and not at all &s;o foo|li&s;h as <HI>Pharoah:</HI> For that he pa&s;&s;ed the Sea, and ta&s;ted not a drop of it: But <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his drunken crew were &s;o mad as to drink their bellies &s;o full on't, as that they all kickt up their heels. And though we trade on the water, yet we drink good wine: I would have you to know that we are rational men, as well as o|thers; and doe under&s;tand our &s;elves in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall appear unto all the world.

<SPEAKER>Drible-D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly &s;ir Captain, he hath made a Fool of me indeed; alas, I can a&s;&s;ure you 'twas my Sow, and Pigges that paid for this brave Coat, and for his ranting in lieu whereof, I now hear by <HI>Jannetie Stronts,</HI> and <HI>Wabbetie Clonters</HI> reports, that we mu&s;t all return from whence we came; and that which is wor&s;e, we mu&s;t returne not halfe &s;o wi&s;e as we were, for that we thought we &s;hould have been coupled.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jan. Stronts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou &s;houlde&s;t rather &s;ay, be marry|ed together, that &s;o the &s;tate of <HI>Holland</HI> might have beene the Wife, and the Common-Wealth of <HI>Eng|land</HI> the Husband, and that by &s;o lovely a copula|tion, they might not onely have produced Herrings, but Whales, to make good &s;tore of Oyle for our cloath; for that you mu&s;t know we have an art to make cloath far better then yours? and the Moun|fiers, the Signiors, the great <HI>Min-Heeres,</HI> are all of them in love with our cloath; be&s;ides we know how to make Fooles of you Engli&s;h, by getting away your Fullers Earth: Moreover we have another expedient (though it lyes Dormant) and the which we will put on foot with &s;peck <HI>John,</HI> the Don Diegos; for that we are great comrades at pre&s;ent; although its

<P>Why? that we &s;hall, and agree in &s;pite of all the Fire-brands in the World; and now I will take a turne among&s;t the Engli&s;h, &s;ince I &s;ee my walking among&s;t my own Country-men is carped at; am I not a free borne Man? &s;hall there not be free quarter between us Captaine?

<P>Good Captain, although we were what you &s;uppo&s;e us to be; yet however let us talke like bro|thers; let me intreat you to pa&s;&s;e by this S. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers Hircanum;</HI> Let us I pray you di&s;cu&s;s and ponder the ca&s;e; and I pray you what is it that rai&s;es the &s;torm, &s;ave your abundance of matter: I perceive you are incen&s;ed. Fir&s;t, by your remembring the barbarous proceedings of a company of drunken knaves, who were on the other &s;ide of the world, too farre from their Ma&s;ters to have their hands held from abu&s;ing of the Engli&s;h: were not, I pray you, the Holland Amba&s;&s;adours two years together dancing an atten|dance on the late two Kings plea&s;ures, proffering their Maje&s;ties and the Nation &s;atisfaction? Shall a wrong done by a company of knaves, during the reigns of forreigners, who are dead and forgotten, be &s;o much re&s;ented by tho&s;e, who will not acknow|ledge them nor theirs, although they &s;hould come on earth again? be&s;ides, the wrong which was acted, was happily done again&s;t &s;uch, who if they were alive might perchance not be in a po&s;&s;ibility of de&s;erving this Common-wealths ju&s;tice or favour: For that it may be they might have proved arch-malignants. And grant all this were not &s;o, yet what &s;hall we &s;ay? They are gone and cannot be recalled&punc; and if &s;atis|faction mu&s;t be given for blood, then let us remem|ber the free-grace, which our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us
<PB N="8" REF="19"> Chri&s;t hath offered to all mankinde; rather then to call upon the ancient laws, which &s;eem to be the &s;um|mit of Rigour, as <HI>life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth;</HI> And if this mu&s;t needs be urged; would it not prove a piece of high inju&s;tice, if &s;o be for the &s;triking out of one tooth of a mans head, that hath his double range of teeth compleat, the tooth of the offender &s;hould be plucked out, although he had but one in his head; certainly you would judge this to be a great deal of cruelty. <HI>Amboyna</HI> bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, I grant you mu&s;t be clea|red; the right of the Engli&s;h Seas mu&s;t be acknow|ledged; for that is mo&s;t notorious, how that when as King <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Spain,</HI> was married to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet could he not claim any Prerogative in the Engli&s;h Seas, in the behalf of his Subjects: <HI>Fer|dinando Tur&s;is</HI> its true did fi&s;h in the Engli&s;h Seas, but it was on a Licence for 22. years, Signed by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> as well as by <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd. But you will &s;ay, what other injuries have there been done you? Why, &s;uch things as are both po&s;&s;ible and conveni|ent mu&s;t be effected, to which purpo&s;e we conceive the Amba&s;&s;adours are come over, accompanied with &s;uch orders as may conduce thereunto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I marry, they are come indeed, for what I pray? to out-brave us with a Fleet, and to kill the good People? I mu&s;t needs tell you that the&s;e are not times, wherein a Cat might not look upon a King; for that as now a King (undi&s;gui&s;ed) dares not look upon an Engli&s;h Cat; nay, not &s;o much as on a dead Cat; nay, not &s;o much as on <HI>Tom VVhittingtons</HI> Cat, which is hung up for a Signe: And mu&s;t they for|&s;ooth, come with a Fleet on our coa&s;t? O, were there not a prohibition on the importation of Oaths by
<PB N="9" REF="19"> Hollanders as well as by Engli&s;h, why I could even &s;wear and &s;wagger at this horrid abu&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good brothers, let me intreat you to give way to the exportation of Oathes by &s;trangers, al|though they &s;hould not pay any cu&s;tom at all for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will have thee to know (and all the world to boot) that we can &s;et out two hundred Men of Warre; and by our dividing of them into four fleets, we &s;hall be able to ma&s;ter the Seas; and &s;o we &s;hall not need to think on &s;uch utterances, as the cutting of dikes, which we &s;corn, and abhor the thoughts there|of; being not &s;o over-pre&s;umptuous as to contradict the Lords Decree, by making a &s;econd Flood. For that all the Nations of the earth &s;hall finde us to be an&s;werable to the Etymologie of our name, <HI>viz.</HI> An|gelical. That which is fair and ju&s;t mu&s;t be expected from us; we will doe as we would be done by; ami|cable in times of Peace; and fair quarter if it mu&s;t needs come to a Warre: and thus much may &s;uffice for the principal. But as for acce&s;&s;aries, I pray thee tell me, good &s;ir Merchant, can&s;t thou per&s;wade thy &s;elf, that we Sea-Captains, and &s;uch others of us as doe re&s;ent the blood-&s;heddings of our country|men, of our brethren and freinds, can be di&s;&s;waded from the begging of our Rulers (even on our knees) that we may have liberty to put to Sea: You mu&s;t know that the whole Nation hath but one tongue, and one heart in this regard; can we not at our ea&s;e take all the Merchandi&s;es wherewith the Holland &s;hips are fraughted? Need our Engli&s;h men venture one groat in Merchandi&s;es? Doth <HI>England</HI> con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Harlemmer meeres?</HI> In <HI>Zuyder Seas?</HI> and in Rivers? Your country men have no Lands nor Parcks; Doe
<PB N="10" REF="20"> but cut off their Traffick, and as then God be with you, ingratefull Generation; And all this while you would have us repeale an Act: I marry, an Act of Parliament: which mu&s;t be as inviolable, as the de|crees of the <HI>Parthians</HI> and <HI>Medes.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover it &s;eemes by your di&s;cour&s;e, that you would faine have us to believe, that the Parliament hath been mi&s;-informed by &s;ome &s;elf intere&s;&s;ed Men, who may perchance be accu&s;ed of &s;ome &s;ecret Mono|poly; and the which may tend to the ruine of a num|ber of Merchants, Arti&s;ts, and Trade&s;-men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I doe not prove it to be &s;o, nay if I make it not appeare unto you, that it is one of the greate&s;t Monopolies that ever was hatcht again&s;t this Nation, as then call me Foole, Nitty-breech, Ninny-hammer, Cocks-cumbe, or any thing what thou wilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you &s;o? Why, I doe very much que&s;tion whether thou wilt not prove to be the Actor, who troubled him&s;elfe to maintaine that five and three were but eight; and that forgetting the merry Grigs Axiome, <HI>viz.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, I know thou art a Pen-man, and ha&s;t the liberty and prerogative of thy Counting-Hou&s;e; and as thou wilt'&s;t not tran&s;gre&s;&s;e the Law of Nations, &s;o will not I plea&s;e my &s;elfe, by a&s;&s;erting un|to that which is before mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> that five and three are nine: yet however I &s;hall be content to hear what thou can&s;t &s;ay, again&s;t that unque&s;tionable truth: How that the Act which prohibites the Im|portation
<PB N="11" REF="20"> by &s;trangers, of &s;uch Commodities as are not of their Countries growth, tendeth to the ad|vantage of our Negotiations, and to the main curtai|ling of all Forrayners, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who (had not this been) would not have beene &s;o over-ha&s;ty, as to harp upon that &s;tring.</P>

<P>Why truly, let me tell you, it may be the States of <HI>Holland</HI> have been made to under&s;tand, that the &s;aid Act was rather publi&s;ht in a threatning manner then otherwaies; and the which I would have you know, no power in the World could ever yet brook; for that every Cock (althoug his feathers be never &s;o Hoary) conceives him&s;elfe to be Ma&s;ter on his owne Dunghill: &s;o likewi&s;e know you the French Proverb, <HI>Amouret &s;eignieuri, n'endure point de Compagnie:</HI> although its granted, that compari&s;ons doe for the mo&s;t part halt, and offend: wherefore we &s;hall proceed to the point, and that we may enjoy our &s;elves with the better Freedome, let us ere we en|ter on our di&s;cour&s;e, turne home-wards the&s;e home|ly Go&s;&s;ips, gooddy <HI>Driggle Draggle-tayle, Wabbetie Clonters,</HI> and <HI>Jannitie Stronts,</HI> who &s;eem to be alarmed by the noi&s;e of a breach; and as for the plain down right Freeze-Lander, we will leave him to take a walke, and ayre him&s;elfe, whil&s;t we, (laying a&s;ide all particular intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially that kil|ling and de&s;troying humour; for that you mu&s;t needs grant, when men have fought it out to the la&s;t; yet mu&s;t they (after many lo&s;&s;es on both &s;ides) come to an agreement at la&s;t, go on with our di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>And why &s;hift me &s;irra Captain? I would
<PB N="12" REF="21"> have thee know that now I have taken a turne round the Exchang; I am re&s;olved to interrupt the Gentleman that &s;pake la&s;t, and al&s;o to tell thee to thy face, that thou art either a great Impo&s;ture, or mightily mi&s;ta|ken, as touching the Sea proceedings; for that it will be proved, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">w that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> my compatriots have been fir&s;t &s;et upon, and mo&s;t Egregiou&s;ly abu&s;ed, which truth, &s;hall be made good by &s;ub&s;tantial proofs, and well grounded evidences, and the which our Amba&s;&s;adors will not be backwards to repre&s;ent. And how that the Engli&s;h have committed &s;uch &s;poyles and out-rages upon us, as are not to be paral|lel'd; For is it not publike, how that one Engli&s;h man of Warre, who &s;et forth with a Letter of Licence (or Mart as you may call it) hath taken more then thirty Holland Merchant men; and I pray you how can this &s;tand before God and Men? that by rea&s;on of a par|ticular pretence, a whole Nation &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o ge|nerall a damage: Moreover was it ever heard of, that Soveraignes and States doe breake, on the occa&s;ion of every particular per&s;ons falling foule? that would be ju&s;t as if Neighbours &s;hould &s;et each others Hou|&s;es on fire, when as their Servants or Dome&s;ticks chance to di&s;agree.</P>
<P>And as to thy former que&s;tion, whether the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> were not wor&s;e then Jewes? what an unhand|&s;ome language is that? and how injurous? &s;ince all the world knowes them to be hone&s;t plaine dealing men, that their word is more binding then all the Engli&s;h Lawyers clau&s;es, <HI>for, too, and,</HI> and which they in&s;ert in their Beds-&s;heets like Indentures, deeds and covenants: The <HI>Hollanders</HI> you mu&s;t know mean right to the Engli&s;h; and love them &s;o well, as that they of|fer
<PB N="13" REF="21"> to ioyne with the Engli&s;h Nation again&s;t any par|ty that &s;hall not keepe a faire corre&s;pondency with them: Now that it &s;tands with the intere&s;t of the En|li&s;h Nation, to keepe a good quarter with the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> hath been proved by twenty undeniable Ar|guments.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides who can gain-&s;ay, but that they are Chri|&s;tians? Nor doe they (as it is &s;candalou&s;ly &s;urmi&s;ed) profane the Lords day; nor in the lea&s;t omit his &s;er|vice: have they not &s;et a deep forfeiture on any per|&s;on that &s;hall be found to &s;ell any thing on the Sab|bath day? And &s;ure I am, that among&s;t them, thou &s;halt not &s;ee &s;uch a &s;pectacle as <HI>Pauls Church</HI> is in, at pre|&s;ent; for that they would either pull it downe, or build it up againe; to the end that &s;trangers &s;hould not have occa&s;ion to que&s;tion their Chri&s;tian profe&s;|&s;ion. Therefore &s;irra Captaine let me advi&s;e thee to leave thy crackings, quackings, and Fulminations, as al&s;o thy grinning at my Coat, the which I mu&s;t tell you, is lyned with a good Fur: For though I doe &s;ometimes talke of a green Chee&s;e, and of Freeze|land Mares; yet am I of &s;uch a con&s;titution, as not to blu&s;h at any Nick-names of Butter-box, Flem|ming, or the like; to which I have a reply at hand, and that in Ryme too; For that it is granted we doe love Butter, and we doe finde it to be good, according to the &s;aying; <HI>Buttertie voor, en buttertie naer, doet Een Mens leven hondert Iaer;</HI> which I will thus engli&s;h you, <HI>Butter before meales, and after repa&s;t,</HI> will make a man hundreds of yeares out-la&s;t. In this &s;en&s;e it was, that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> outvide the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Spinolas Quible,</HI> when as he fea&s;ted the &s;aid Marque&s;&s;e during the Treaty of their Truce; and at which

<P>Be &s;hrow my heart thou ha&s;t hit the Naile on the head now; in good &s;ooth, I did alwaies re&s;pect this Dromidary Freeze-lander to be &s;ome di&s;qui&s;ed Rhetoritian, purpo&s;ely &s;ent to walke about our Ex|change, for to ob&s;erve the di&s;po&s;itions of Men: you &s;ee how he hath wit at will, and can &s;peake to the purpo&s;e too, mo&s;t like a cunning Logitian; however to the point Merchant I pray you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly if it be &s;o, as that the Engli&s;h Sea|men have fir&s;t abu&s;ed the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and that all the bruits which are come from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> are not well grounded; why then it concernes every one of us to be circum&s;pect and watchfull, for to di&s;co|ver what Firebrands the&s;e are which goe about to put &s;trife betweene the&s;e two Nations, that &s;o they may make the Devill keepe a Holy-day; nay that the Turks and Infidels may laugh at us, when as they &s;hall &s;ee tho&s;e, which profe&s;&s;e one and the &s;elfe &s;ame Religion, &s;heath their Swords in each others bowels, <HI>Cui bono?</HI> for that this que&s;tion wil certainly be made by all juditious hone&s;t and wel meaning per&s;ons. And as then, will not all wi&s;e Stati&s;ts conclude, that the great Devill of delu&s;ion hath blind-folded us, even
<PB N="15" REF="22"> in a time, when as our mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured intelligences do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> confirme unto us from all parts, that our Adver&s;aries doe greatly combine again&s;t us; and that in ca&s;e wee doe not ha&s;ten to prevent them, they will venter ere long to bang us by Bell, Booke, and Candle, &s;ince its too apparant that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> will be ne|ce&s;&s;itated to agree; and their di&s;contented Princes may as &s;oone be moved to put up their Swords, which if they doe, &s;hall we not, I pray you be the object of their &s;a &s;a.</P>
<P>But now to the point, in reference to that which is bruited concering the in&s;tances which are &s;aid to be made for the Parliaments repealing of their Act, concerning the prohibiting of the Importation of Goods for &s;trangers, and the which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an unque&s;tionable meanes to undoe the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to increa&s;e the Engli&s;h Navigation: For (as &s;ome conceive) were it otherwayes, why as then &s;hould the <HI>Hollanders</HI> be &s;o &s;olicitous (as they are &s;aid to be) to have that Act repealed?</P>
<P>Herein I &s;hall ingeniou&s;ly declare unto you, what I have learnt by experience; and I &s;hall prove it un|to you, how that the prohibiting of Importation of Goods by &s;trangers, will neitheir encrea&s;e the Eng|li&s;h Navigation, nor undoe the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> but on the contrary, it will be extreame prejudiciall unto the Engli&s;h Nation.</P>
<P>As for example, in the fir&s;t place; The cu&s;tomes will be dimini&s;hed by the halfe: for that &s;trangers pay double cu&s;tomes; Nor will the wa&s;te of Commo|dities be greater then formerly, who&s;oever the Im|porters be.</P>
<P>Secondly, Suppo&s;e that from <HI>London</HI> there be 40.
<PB N="16" REF="23"> 50. or 100. Ships more &s;et forth to fetch Commodi|ties; yet it mu&s;t be granted, that there will be 500. Ships le&s;&s;e imployed from the other parts of <HI>Eng|land, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which were u&s;ed to fetch all manners of Wares from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For all the Sea Townes in</HI> England <HI>carry one or other Commoditie con&s;tantly for</HI> Holland, Zealand, <HI>and other parts beyond the Sea, yea divers Townes, as</HI> Yorke, Hull, <HI>and all the Countries,</HI> Yarmouth, Norwitch, <HI>and all that Country; and &s;o likewi&s;e of</HI> Colche&s;ter, Sandwich, <HI>and other hath the chiefe Sale, and vent for their Commodi|ties, and they goe over not halfe freighted, yet commonly all of them returne full of all manner of Commodities from thence: In &s;tead whereof they mu&s;t all returne for the mo&s;t part empty, becau&s;e mo&s;t of what they bring from thence, are Commodities of other Countries growths, whereby Trading will cea&s;e, Merchants will be con&s;train|ed to &s;tay for returnes till their Commodities be &s;old, and their monies received, for to make them over by exchange unto</HI> London, <HI>and returne thither with their empty Ships: So likewi&s;e will they be con&s;trained to return their monies thither in &s;uch Commodities as they want, at much dearer Rates (even for their ready money) then they could have had them for in</HI> Holland <HI>upon time, and would have made two or three returnes from</HI> Holland, <HI>be|fore they can make one in this way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be&s;ides that &s;ome wares are cheaper in</HI> Holland, <HI>then at the place where they grow, and where they are made. Moreover it will prove a great lo&s;&s;e to all the Townes in</HI> England, <HI>that they may not take this opportunity, but mu&s;t he forced to goe further to buy Hempe; To</HI> Danzick <HI>for Corne, to</HI> Venice <HI>and</HI> Zant <HI>for Currens, run great hazards, e&s;pecially in the&s;e times, (when as the Seas are
<PB N="17" REF="23"> be&s;et with numbers of men of War) and loofe many moneths time to</HI> buy their wares dearer.</P>
<P><HI>Be&s;ides that all the&s;e Townes commonly &s;ave halfe of all their exchanges by the returne of tho&s;e Commodities, and many get the double of their exchanges by returne of them.</HI></P>
<P>To all which, the experient in the Traffick do adde this for a maine Argument, of the undoing of the Trade of mo&s;t of the Townes, in <HI>England. viz. In that all other Townes except</HI> London, <HI>can vent but a lit|tle Hempe, a little Iron, a little Spice, and &s;o of a hundred things more, and therefore its argued thus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That their Ships mu&s;t needs lye &s;till, becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;mall Townes cannot vent a Ships loading of each, or of two or three Commodities; nor have they money enough to have a &s;tock lye in</HI> Holland, <HI>in Wares to be &s;old; and another &s;tock to be &s;ent to another place, to fetch home Commodities from &s;o remote Countrie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That many</HI> Hollanders <HI>will goe and dwell in</HI> Ea&s;t|land, France, <HI>and other places; and &s;o will bring home Hempe, Pitch, and Tar from</HI> Ea&s;tland; <HI>as al&s;o Wynes, and Salt from</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Spaine, <HI>the which as it cannot bee hindred, will enrich them, and impoveri&s;h</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>And as experience tells, that as by this meanes all, or many Forrayne Commodities will be the dearer in</HI> Eng|land, <HI>it will thereupon en&s;ue that the Engli&s;h Nation will loo&s;e a great part of their Trade in forraigne parts; and that the</HI> Hollanders <HI>will incorporate the &s;ame to them|&s;elves, by being al&s;o to &s;ell cheaper then the Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And this for the particular rea&s;ons, whereby the Argument is made the more infallible, in that they have more Money then they can well be&s;tow at three and foure <HI>per cent.</HI> u&s;e; and that as they have more
<PB N="18" REF="24"> Water then Land, nor any Parkes for to &s;quander a|way their monies on wild Deeres; nor doe they mar|ry unto Lords Sons, or Ladyes Daughters, for that they &s;ay <HI>Sort by Sort:</HI> they therefore imploy all their monies upon Traffick, which they pur&s;ue with the more eagerne&s;&s;e; all which con&s;idered, I would faine know by what meanes you intend to put them out of their Trade, or hinder them to buy and &s;ell Commodities, at better Rates then the Engli&s;h can buy them, in tho&s;e parts where they grow?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay nothing but what experience prompts me unto, whereby it may al&s;o be made good, how that the &s;ole meanes, whereby the Engli&s;h Traf|fick may be encrea&s;ed, is to pitch upon &s;uch benefici|ciall e&s;tabli&s;hments, as are mentioned in the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Sea-Cabbin Dialogue:</HI> for that by them mo|nies will be reduced to a lower value, and for the want whereof, the Engli&s;h will never be able to buy and &s;ell at &s;uch ea&s;ie Rates as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me thinkes thou &s;peake&s;t of particulars, which are mentioned in the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Sea-Cab|bin Dialogue;</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e did I heare of other relati|ons, concerning tho&s;e advantages which wi&s;e Stati&s;ts have ever found in the impo&s;ing of &s;mall Taxes on the importation and exportation of Merchandizes: when as the Merchants doe not &s;o much as thinke on the defrauding of the cu&s;tomes; nor on the decei|ving of each other, by their &s;undry fal&s;ifications of Wares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hereon I mu&s;t needs tell you, how that the bare Animo&s;ity and &s;elfe-Intere&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;ome per|&s;ons,
<PB N="19" REF="24"> have oftentimes cau&s;ed an interruption in the good corre&s;pondency between Nations. As for in|&s;tance, The breach betweene <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> with the Emperour <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth, between Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Phillip</HI> the &s;econd; as al&s;o tho&s;e with <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> in the late Kings time: when as at length, after the &s;everall Nations and Parties had &s;ufferd by the like interrup|tions, it was found requi&s;ite to order things againe at any Rate; and thus defective and di&s;advantagious Treaties were patcht up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray you? what is that which is whi&s;|pered among curious men, touching &s;everall parti|culars which are contained (in a Remon&s;trance; and the which hath of late been proffered to the Par|liament, wherein the Author &s;aith, that in ca&s;e there be not any reflection made on his proffers, he as then remaines a free man borne; and in this &s;tates regards a &s;econd Colomba.</P>
<P>The foregoing lines, of which conclu&s;ion makes mention of one <HI>Kelly</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dayes, who (to the knowledge of &s;everall per&s;ons of credit in tho&s;e dayes, e&s;pecially old Mr. <HI>Challoner.</HI>) had the &s;ecret of producing of gold, and for the which all the world &s;ought unto him.</P>
<P>Now truly my &s;elfe have been on &s;ome nooks and parts of the golden World, where I heard that there are certaine particular men, who Trade in Gold, and bring it in lumps to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> though they will not di&s;cover unto them how they come by it, and its thought that they have &s;ome particular my&s;tery therein; nay even an Art of Production.</P>
<P>And if I be not deceived, I was al&s;o told hereof,
<PB N="20" REF="25"> in the &s;ame leafe of the &s;aid Remon&s;trance, it is &s;aid that the Proponants &s;ecrets are of another gue&s;s ex|tent and value then tho&s;e, whereon Sir <HI>Water Rawley</HI> and Captaine <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> had fixt their de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e heard I another Captaine &s;ay, that to his knowledg they were of another gue&s;s nature then Sir <HI>William Wallers</HI> late de&s;igne.</P>
<P>Now in ca&s;e this be &s;o, why &s;hould we not looke after it? for if wee &s;hould not fall foule with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> or with any other Nations (as the <HI>French</HI> who are already together by the Eares) why &s;hould we as then be &s;o neglectful of our owne good, as to &s;uffer any other Nation to bereave us of &s;uch an advantage, and take it away even before our No&s;es? Be&s;ides are there not many Cavaleers abroad, who are able to &s;crape &s;uch a &s;tock together, as may well &s;erve for &s;o ordinary an equipage, towards the effect|ing of the &s;ame; and whereof the Proponant &s;peakes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly as for my part, I conceive that &s;ome ill informed per&s;on may thinke, that a Reply appro|ving of what you &s;ay, might &s;avour of an Act, to take off the edge of your fir&s;t fury again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But as for my &s;elfe, I doe &s;peake &s;incerely, and really as I meane, and as I believe; and therefore I an&s;wer you thus in generall termes.</P>
<P>That the &s;afe&s;t Maximes which this &s;tate may put in practi&s;e, are to procure unto the Engli&s;h Nation all the po&s;&s;ible advantages that may be, e&s;pecially to|wards the attaining unto all Chri&s;tians, glorious and profitable goods: And whereas many of us do con|ceive that the Parliament reflects on providence; &s;o do many of us believe, that the Officers of their Ar|mies,
<PB N="21" REF="25"> e&s;pecially their Generall the Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in|tend the &s;ame; not that he reflects on that which Almanack-makers and other &s;uch like Pamphet-wri|ters &s;et forth; How that the Pope &s;hall be pulled out of his Seat by him, by rea&s;on of a Lyon which he bears in his Arms: But that the true Lyon of <HI>Judah</HI> is he, who &s;hall pull all tho&s;e out of their Seats, who doe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them on fal&s;e grounds. Now, in ca&s;e heaven hath Decreed that this &s;hall be effected in the&s;e dayes; and by a &s;econdary means, <HI>viz.</HI> The Parliament of <HI>Englands</HI> happy Genius, although there were no &s;uch thing in his Arms as a Lyon; It might que&s;tionle&s;&s;e be encompa&s;&s;ed without the in|fluence of the Stars, and allu&s;ions of Almanack-ma|kers: For that the Lord hath a regard unto the in|tentions of men: <HI>Cains</HI> &s;acrifice was one as well as <HI>Abels,</HI> although not accepted of; and its moreover &s;aid, <HI>My &s;on, give me thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. Now for as much as concerns the other particular, which you hinted at; Truly this is my opinion thereon, That it would be a farr wi&s;er part to minde &s;uch like Chri&s;tian, glorious, and beneficiall atcheivements as you &s;peak off; wa|ving the enraged humour of &s;hedding of blood, and &s;etting of the very Seas on fire; whereby we &s;hould but give the Devil an advantage over us, and would he not thereby have hand&s;omly compa&s;&s;ed his own ends?</P>

<P>Moreover, why doe we hear men talk of a particu|lar, which is contained in the afore&s;aid Remon&s;trance, touching &s;even millions of pounds due unto this Na|tion; and why is there no reflection made thereon, whil&s;t that we let our minds rove afar off in &s;eeking after things &s;o remote; and in the mean while, none of us &s;eems &s;o much to mind the&s;e concernments at hand, as to &s;ay, let us have tho&s;e &s;even millions of pounds, for that they may &s;erve to take off the A&s;&s;e&s;s|ments and other charges, and &s;o disburden the Peo|ple; the rather, for that the Gentlemen who knows the meanes to recover the &s;aid &s;even Millions of pounds, doth ince&s;&s;antly crave leave to be there|unto authorized, onely in four Words. <HI>viz.

<P>Have not your Rulers made a decree again&s;t this vermine? and I doubt not, but that at their fir&s;t modelling of the Law, they will have a care to pro|vide Emphaticall Articles again&s;t the &s;ame.

<PB N="32" REF="31"> and angled by the Law of God. Be&s;ides unle&s;&s;e your Rulers fix on the modelling of a Law, and not on the &s;ingle reforming thereof, ob&s;erving Gods Commandment unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to put off his &s;hooes, which I conceive to be, by putting away &s;inne, the cau&s;e of the old Law, and to walk upon a holy ground, on &s;uch principles as are an&s;werable to the dictates of that <HI>Godly Book,</HI> and in particular the Go|&s;pel: Nay, as a Divine &s;aith very well, that <HI>Hone&s;t Book,</HI> in default whereof this your pretended &s;etling of the Law will be but lo&s;t labour, and as a meer mock|&s;how, or as the lamentations of a Theef under the Gallows, who endeavours to protract the time, until &s;ome brybed reprieve be brought: and therefore I would have your Law &s;erved as a Judge did a Theef in Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dayes, who receiving a reprieve for a Malefactor, cau&s;ed the reprieve to be put be|twixt the Theeves neck and the halter, and then commanded the Executioner to goe through with his part: So would I have the Law to be gone through withall by a &s;etting of &s;uch Lawes as are an&s;werable to the will of God, and as may befit the very e&s;&s;ence, re&s;emblance, and being of a Common-Wealth: for that otherwi&s;e (as I told you before) it will be but lo&s;t labour, and much like the di&s;cour&s;es of (a com|pany of impertinent Logitians) who talking of a Chaos, do per&s;wade them&s;elves, that God, out of that confu&s;ed thing (though made by him&s;elfe as they &s;ay, and whereby they con&s;equently argue him to be the Author of confu&s;ion) made the world by de|grees, determining thence, that things were after|wards put in order: according to which &s;en&s;e of put|ting things in order <HI>gradatim,</HI> your Rulers, cannot
<PB N="33" REF="31"> (to my thinking) pitch upon a better expedient, then to &s;ettle an order which may be conformable unto his orderly di&s;po&s;all, who is the Author of all orderly perfection, and who hath given the &s;everall Cele&s;tiall Orbs their particular functions. Moreover even as when this grand Arti&s;t had atcheived all his works, he as then created that image of his, for who&s;e &s;ake all tho&s;e Cele&s;tiall bodyes were ordained to per|forme their &s;everall functions: He as then made Man and Femall, the which he did doubtle&s;&s;e with an in|tent, to the end that the Femall &s;hould be of u&s;e to the man; and therefore (in my minde) it may ju&s;t|ly be expected, that even this Femall Creature ought to be of a publik u&s;e in a well &s;etled Government, and to beare a fit part in the Common-Wealths con|cernments; that excepted, which is not allowed of in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> not for the whore keeping Sonnes of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>

In the fir&s;t, you will meet with many notable examples of the learning and wi&s;|dome of women; of their con&s;tancy and courage; of their chai&s;tity; of their abilities to govern: he more|over tels you, how that <HI>Ceres</HI> Queen of <HI>Sicily</HI> was the fir&s;t that taught people to live under laws; that <HI>Va|la&s;ca</HI> Queen of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> governed her E&s;tates without the Councel or advi&s;e of any men; he tels you al&s;o of the Piety, and Religiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of women; on the proofs that <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> her &s;i|&s;ter, did preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t among&s;t the <HI>Illi|rians,</HI> and converted all its inhabitans, how that the <HI>Sara's</HI> were devout, the <HI>Maryes</HI> humble, and pacified per&s;ons: The <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Religious, ob&s;erving all the Commandments of God blamele&s;&s;e; the <HI>Pri&s;cillas</HI> heavenly, and rich in di&s;cour&s;e; the <HI>Bathesbis, Loy&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Eunices,</HI> carefull in the in&s;tructing of their Chil|dren in the knowledge of God; and finally, how that <HI>Catharina, Alexandria,</HI> being under the Tyranny of <HI>Maxcentius,</HI> was illuminated with divine knowledge from above, and con&s;tantly maintained the faith of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Secondly, you &s;hall (in Mr. <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> his &s;hort cut to a great quiet) find that work for a good Magi|&s;trate, which may &s;tand with Religion, Mercy, and Ju&s;tice: without which there can be no good &s;ettle|ment,
<PB N="36" REF="33"> nor any Moddel framed, whereby all men may be found to ob&s;erve Peace; the main &s;ecuring where|of mu&s;t be &s;etled by the framing of a good Con&s;ci|ence: whereby the grand enemy of order, will be kept out and debarred.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I mu&s;t needs confe&s;&s;e that I have found &s;o many truths, recorded of worthy women in the &s;aid <HI>Elogium Heroinum,</HI> as that I greatly marvell how &s;o many injurious Pamplets, have been pub|li&s;hed again&s;t them in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I have found &s;o many ob&s;ervable things, <HI>in the good worke for a Magi&s;trate,</HI> as that I cannot per|&s;wade my &s;elfe, but that if tho&s;e particulars which are therein mentioned, were &s;etled here in <HI>England,</HI> this Nation might be ju&s;tly termed a happy one indeed: in the which <HI>&s;hort cut,</HI> if you ob&s;erve it, there is al&s;o a &s;pecification, how a good number of Women may be very well imployed.</P>
<P>Finally, Its my conceite, that in ca&s;e <HI>that hone&s;t Book, the Bible,</HI> be laid before tho&s;e who &s;hall be ordained to pre&s;cribe Rules and Lawes, as then we &s;hall no more &s;tand in need of tho&s;e Catterpillers, called Attornies and Solicitors; for that as then all men may be confi|dent, <HI>of a &s;hort cut to a great quiet:</HI> as al&s;o that the Cheat will thereby be confounded to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Freez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t needs tell you that ere long, you may &s;ee &s;omewhat in Print on that &s;ubject: in the interim I &s;hall believe that the condition of the Engli&s;h Nati|on, will be the more an&s;werable unto the e&s;&s;ence and con&s;titution of a Common-wealth; whereas there &s;hall be a Law, whereby the old Norman Law &s;hall be extingui&s;hed: that every man &s;hall have liberty to debate his own ca&s;e, before &s;uch hone&s;t men as &s;hall hear them <HI>gratis</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you mention the word <HI>Gratis,</HI> I mu&s;t aske you in the fir&s;t place, whether you would not have three kind of men to act <HI>gratis? viz.</HI> Mini&s;ters, Judges, and Phy&s;itians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Freez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, that I would; that is to &s;ay, I would have the State to maintain the Mini&s;ters, the Judges, and the Phy&s;itians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what &s;ay you to the Law it &s;elfe? unto Clyents, and their manner of addre&s;&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Freez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why marry, I would have the old Law fir&s;t of all to be &s;o deeply interred, as that it &s;hould never ri&s;e again, except at dooms-day, when as the corrupt Lawers them&s;elves &s;hall be brought to their Tryall, without any <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> or reprieve at all.</P>
<P>Secondly, I would have this Common-wealths Judges to be &s;uch, as that the Scripture phra&s;e might be applyed unto them, <HI>viz. For that now, Saints &s;hall judge the world.</HI> 1 Cor. ch. 6. v. 2. To the end that men might not hear tho&s;e reproaches which are mention|ed in the fifth ver&s;. of the &s;ame Chap. <HI>viz. I &s;peake it</HI> to your &s;hame: is it &s;o, that there is not a wi&s;e man a|mong&s;t you? no not one that &s;hall be able to jugde be|tween his brethren?</P>
<P>That &s;o likewi&s;e the que&s;tion in 1 <HI>Cor. ch.</HI> 6. <HI>v.</HI> 1. may not be asked, <HI>viz.</HI> Doe any of you, having a matter a|gain&s;t aonther, go to Law, before the unju&s;t, and not before the Saints?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray you? where &s;hall there be &s;uch found among&s;t Mortals, who inhabit fle&s;h and Clay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Freez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thats a que&s;tion indeed, though it may be &s;oon re&s;olved; For that when&s;oever the Rulers &s;hall fix on &s;uch a re&s;olution, they may ea&s;ily find out &s;uch as will make good <HI>H. P.</HI> his &s;aying, in his &s;hort Cut to great ea&s;e; and by the pro&s;ecuting of this their de&s;igne, they may acquire unto their Government, the true forme of a Common-wealth.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="34">
<P>For that at the very entrance of their framing a Plat-form to decide all controver&s;ies, the which may ari&s;e between man and man in temporall matters, as well as in criminall; as al|&s;o on the point of <HI>Meum,</HI> and <HI>Tuum;</HI> they may pitch on the meanes to remove all Cau&s;es whence the grand controver&s;ies among&s;t the mo&s;t eminent's Families do ari&s;e: mark me well, and be not &s;tartled at it; I &s;ay the cau&s;es which proceed, from an elder Lording brothers domineering over his younger brother, for naught for&s;ooth, &s;ave that he hath a Title above him, that he hath an E&s;tate, and that he therefore can &s;pend and domineer like a little Tyrant over his &s;laves.</P>
<P N="1">1. To prevent all which Fathers give to thy elde&s;t Son a double portion, if you plea&s;e but divide the re&s;t of the E&s;tate equally among&s;t your Children, as then they will be all Free Common-Wealths men, and not Bond-men, as then a &s;econd, third, fourth; nay younge&s;t brother more or le&s;&s;e, &s;hall be able to do the States good &s;ervice, to live like a free man borne, and not be reduced unto de&s;perate cour&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. Moreover let all Fathers, appoint this double propor|tion to their elde&s;t Sonnes conditionally; That is to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y, in ca&s;e he proves to be a vertuous man, in default whereof, let the younger brother have that double proportion, if he be more de&s;erving then the elder: whereby men will be brought to &s;tudy godline&s;&s;e and goodne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;econd main thing, which (in my conceit) is to be pitcht upon, is the &s;ettling of a general Record office, the practicall part whereof will for ever cut off a world of contentions, di&s;-inable cheats from going on in their de&s;tructive cour&s;es, and &s;ettle all men in their proprieties.</P>
<P>In the third place, let your Rulers remove all Arre&s;ts what&s;oever, or Debts, and con&s;equently all impri&s;onments for the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let them al&s;o abrogate the putting of men to death for Theft; Doth not the Text &s;ay, <HI>And if any man &s;ue thee at Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloake al&s;o,</HI> Mat. 5. v. 40.</P>
<P N="5">5. Why &s;hould we urge the &s;aying, <HI>An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</HI> for that it would &s;eem to be a piece of inju&s;tice, to put out the eye of a man, who hath but one, for having put out anothers, who had two: and &s;o likewi&s;e with the Teeth, in which regard to my thinking, the &s;cripture old Law might be di&s;pen&s;'d withall.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let no Marriages be lawfull, without the Parents con&s;ent.</P>
<P>And this is all which you &s;hall have from me for the pre&s;ent, lea&s;t the five and three man &s;hould &s;tep in again; and that the merry grig &s;hould have cau&s;e to urge his former &s;aying, and to laugh at us by his inferring. <HI>That to meddle with nothing is best.</HI></P>
