<P>BY a Letter from Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell,</HI> dated the 24th In&s;tant, when he was at an Anchor before <HI>la Hogue,</HI> we have this Account, That the Admiral, having the day before &s;ent Vice-Admiral <HI>Rooke,</HI> with a Squadron of Ships and Fire-Ships, and all the Boats in the Fleet, to burn the Ships that were there penned up; it &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that &s;ix were burnt that Night, and &s;ix more the next Morning. Of the&s;e, &s;ix were Three-Deck-Ships, and the other &s;ix from Sixty to Seventy Guns, and one Ship of Fifty &s;ix Guns was over&s;et, and utterly lo&s;t; &s;o that the whole num|ber in that Bay was de&s;troy'd. The Men in the Boats behaved them&s;elves &s;o bravely, that they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal of the Enemies Ships, and beat the <HI>French</HI> with their own Guns from their Platforms.</P>
<P>The Fleet is now &s;o di&s;po&s;ed upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> that if there be any more <HI>French</HI> Ships thereabouts, we may hope to have a good Account of them.</P>
