<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS, SHEWING The Ju&s;tice and Equity of the pre&s;ent intended E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, as it re&s;pects the Old Company, the Ingrafted Stock, and the pre&s;ent PROPOSAL.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE Old <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company have been guilty of &s;o many Depredations, and arbitrary and illegal Proceed|ings again&s;t their Fellow Subjects, by taking and con|fi&s;cating their Ships (by their own Court of Admiralty &s;et up in the <HI>Indies);</HI> the Inju&s;tice and Barbarity u&s;ed to their Per|&s;ons, and Hanging them by Martial Law; endeavouring to make the <HI>Indians</HI> believe, that the Ships of Merchants (not concerned in the Company) were Pyrats; by borrowing a great Sum of Money at <HI>Surat,</HI> and then making an unju&s;t and chargeable War with the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and Seizing his Ships to a great value, tho' they had given Pa&s;&s;es to them; and many other Enormities done Abroad: And here at Home, dividing out their Stock, whil&s;t they ow'd great Sums of Money at Intere&s;t, to be out of the reach of a Parliament; and then two Months after (by a &s;ort of Legerde|main) doubling it, and drawing many unwary Per&s;ons in by a frau|dulent way of Stock Jobbing, and underhand buying and &s;elling Stock for the Company's Account: Letting out the Trade to Li|cen&s;e to Foreigners: Selling Goods by private Contract, and al|tering their Lots after publick Notice of Sale. And at length, to evade their being Di&s;&s;olv'd, as the Hou&s;e of Commons twice Ad|dre&s;s'd the King to do; they fully agreed to &s;ubmit to &s;uch Re|gulations as His Maje&s;ty &s;hould think proper. But afterwards when the Regulations were made, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch their Declaration of Submi&s;&s;ion, they rejected almo&s;t all the Material Particulars, and therein broke their Faith with His Maje&s;ty and the Nation. And before the la&s;t New Sub&s;criptions, the Old Company having little or no Stock, advanced 320000 <HI>l.</HI> as an additional Stock, to &s;end out &s;ome Ships, to <HI>India;</HI> and in order to deceive His Maje&s;ty, the New Sub&s;cribers declared the &s;ame to be part of their Stock; and that their Stock was worth 744000 <HI>l.</HI> Whereupon His Maje&s;ty directed that the Sum of 744000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;hould be added to the then Joynt Stock of the &s;aid Company, by the new Sub&s;criptions of &s;uch Per&s;ons who &s;hould be minded to adventure any &s;hare in the General Joynt Stock
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">of the &s;aid Company. And afterwards, ju&s;t before the Charter pa&s;&s;ed, the Old Company Voted the &s;aid 320000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;hould be paid back to the Per&s;ons concerned in the &s;aid Old Company; and accordingly when the New Sub&s;cribers Money came in, paid them&s;elves out of it. So that this Company having made va&s;t Profit of the Trade, and Spoils incident thereunto, and divided it among&s;t them&s;elves; and being guilty of &s;uch great Crimes and Irregularities, have no rea|&s;on at all to complain, but rather to be thankful, if all is pa&s;t by without calling them to account.</P>
<P N="2">II. But though every body thinks the Old Company have rea&s;on to be &s;ilent, and that they e&s;cape well if they go unpuni&s;hed; yet &s;ome would in&s;inuate, that tho&s;e who came in, and grafted upon them, and brought in fre&s;h Money to the Old Stock, will have hard mea&s;ure, if the Trade be now taken from them and given to other People; and that it will be an Inju&s;tice to all, but particularly to many Widows and Orphans concerned therein. But this Objection carries no Weight, if it be con&s;ider'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. None came in upon the la&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment but had fair Warn|ing: They were told publickly in Print, over and over, in what State and Condition the Old Company's Affairs were; They were told that their Stock was worth little upon a ju&s;t and fair Account; They were made acquainted what Engagements and Debts they were under in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and what they ow'd in <HI>England,</HI> and by what undue means they had wa&s;ted their Stock; They knew the Law did not warrant any Settlement by Charter exclu&s;ive of others: And if notwith&s;tanding all, they would adventure, who can help it? The Truth is, They thought to have out-witted others, and to have made great Profit by a &s;udden Advance of their Stock; but if they have found them&s;elves mi&s;taken, and that the Company play'd them &s;uch a Trick as they had done with others before, whom can they blame but them&s;elves? The Government is no ways bound to make them Reparation: They &s;ay they have met with very great Lo&s;&s;es; if &s;o, and that tho&s;e Lo&s;&s;es have lower'd the Value of their Stock, it is a Misfortune has befallen other Traders as well as them; They that will Adventure, mu&s;t run the Hazard, and take their Fortune.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to any Right or Property in the Trade, That is a vain and groundle&s;s Pretence: If they could pretend to a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, That is the mo&s;t; and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion gives no Right: But they have not. That neither; for (though by their Good-will they would have excluded all Mankind be&s;ides them&s;elves) yet the Trade thither has been carried on by others as well as them; One by a Charter, the Others by the Stated Law of the Land, and a Concurrent Vote of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons; <HI>That it was Lawful for all Per&s;ons to Trade to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, <HI>unle&s;s re&s;train'd by Act of Parlia|ment.</HI> And as to their Forts and Ca&s;tles, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they will be taken from them without giving them a Recom|pence.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<P N="3">3. As to the Cry of Widows and Orphans being concern'd, if they mean tho&s;e who are concerned in the Old Stock, Their Husbands and Parents have had &s;ufficient Profit out of the Trade, and &s;o they can have no rea&s;on to complain. And upon the Additional Stock or New E&s;tabli&s;hment, no Orphans could come concern'd, not having the Di&s;po&s;ition of their own Money. And if any Widows did <HI>therein</HI> adventure a &s;mall Part of what they had, (for much to be &s;ure they would not) none of them who would take the lea&s;t pains to inform them&s;elves, could be ignorant upon what Foot the Old Stock &s;tood; and if then they would run the Ri&s;que, they mu&s;t take their Lot with others. But in truth, the noi&s;e is mo&s;t from the riche&s;t Men in the City, who for every 1000 <HI>l.</HI> have had 15000 <HI>l.</HI> out of that Stock; and what belongs not to them, is for the mo&s;t part, for Jews and Fo|reigners, who are thought to have half the Stock.</P>
<P N="3">III. And now as to the New Propo&s;al. What ought to be a more prevailing Rea&s;on at this Juncture to induce the Parliament to hearken to it, than the advancing Two Millions of Money for the Service of the Government? And tho&s;e who are willing to &s;erve the Go|vernment therein, it &s;eems Ju&s;t and Equitable to let them come in, in the &s;ame Proportion, to the Advantages of this Trade.</P>
<P>And the Sum being &s;o large, it will make the Trade &s;o much the more diffu&s;ive. There is no appearance of any ones being &s;treightned, or excluded, who has a mind to be concerned in the Trade, there being room for &s;o large a Stock, there will never want &s;ome People, who will be willing on rea&s;onable Terms to a&s;&s;ign their Licen&s;es to Trade, to others; or they may Trade them&s;elves, or be concerned with others, either in &s;ingle Ships, or in a Joint Stock, as it &s;eems intended by Parliament to permit every one to have that liberty.</P>
<P>And there is no Inju&s;tice or Hard&s;hip done the Company, &s;ince they have liberty to come in upon the &s;ame Terms as others; and whil&s;t they have offered to lend 700000 <HI>l.</HI> to get the whole Trade to them&s;elves, and thereby to do the Nation and their Fellow Sub|jects a Prejudice; they may, if they &s;ee fit, lend the &s;ame Sum to come in upon an equal Foot with others.</P>
