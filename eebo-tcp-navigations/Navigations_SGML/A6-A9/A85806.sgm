<HEAD>To the Engli&s;h Nation.</HEAD>
<P>_IN this unquiet age, I conceive, there is no|thing &s;o pertinent to a mans felicity, next to the enjoying of happy places, as to know where they are. And to think our neigh|bouring Regions of <HI>Europe</HI> receive a greater &s;hare of pro&s;perity than we in <HI>England,</HI> is (without doubt) a great mi&s;take. Neither doth any part of the old World make &s;uch promi&s;es to all &s;orts of men as doth the New World, commonly called <HI>America.</HI> For he that &s;hall de&s;ire to advance him&s;elf by his labour, will finde many places
<PB REF="5">
where he may do it with much qui|etne&s;&s;e. He that &s;hall de&s;ire to en|joy much land, and live in a Civil Government under others, may finde places enough for him to pitch upon. He that &s;hall de&s;ire to command a Countrey him|&s;elf, and get into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, without difficulty, wil finde many I&s;lands fit for his turn, that are fruitfull and de&s;olate, wanting In|habitants, which at &s;mall charge may be tran&s;ported thither. He that &s;hall de&s;ire to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of great rich mines of gold and &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, and large Do|minions, and withall hath but for|titude, courage, and a rea&s;onable Engli&s;h Gentlemans E&s;tate, may by an ordinary Providence over him, attain to the&s;e great matters. And that man that &s;hall have &s;tore of Commodities lie by him, which he cannot vent, although they are nece&s;&s;ary for mans accomodation,
<PB REF="5">
will finde here places, that he may exchange them at, to his great ad|vantage.</P>
<P>But if the Decipherers of this Orbe had been as cautious in &s;et|ting down truths, as they have been prolixious in impertinencies, our Nation would certainly ere this have made greater advantages upon tho&s;e Regions.</P>
<P>For, my part, as I am an Engli&s;h man, &s;o I de&s;ire that name and people may grow great and famous and extend their authority and name beyond either <HI>Roman, Greci|an, A&s;&s;yrian</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Nations. And if from this di&s;cour&s;e they may draw any thing that may prove for their Honour or Profit, I have my aim. And I &s;hall a&s;&s;ure them, I have related nothing but what my own knowledg or good intelligence per&s;wades me is cer|tainly true, which my future acti|ons with Gods leave &s;hall declare.

I have been plain in di&s;cour&s;e of the Forreign Commerce of our Nation.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Commerce of the Engli&s;h Nation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe Navigation and Commerce of the En|gli&s;h Nation, is &s;o pro|portioned, that upon the divi&s;ion of the world, it may properly be &s;aid, that it is traded
<PB N="2" REF="9">
by four &s;everall parts. The grea|te&s;t of which is <HI>America,</HI> the next in account is <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the third <HI>Africa,</HI> and the lea&s;t <HI>Europe,</HI> in which is our native Countrey, it being a We&s;twardly part of this Divi&s;ion. From whence there ari&s;es to mee the&s;e Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, whether the trade be equally divided according to the quality of the places traded with.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, whether the lo&s;&s;e to &s;ome of the&s;e places be not grea|ter then the gains.</P>
<P>The third, whether the trade of the Common-wealth may not be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fourth, how it hath been hindred, and what is the let in the grants of it.</P>
<P>The fifth, whether there may not be a cour&s;e taken to quicken the trade and encourage Adventu|rers.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<HEAD>To an&s;wer the fir&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>We finde that in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> there are &s;ix mo&s;t potent Emperours, which are the Emperour of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> of <HI>Japan,</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> of <HI>Turkey,</HI> of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> and of the <HI>Moguls</HI> or <HI>Mogores.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar,</HI> hath few or no Ports, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> not many, all the re&s;t have &s;tore of Ports, and rich Cities, on them, fit for Com|merce and trade. And it hath been affirmed by the Natives of tho&s;e parts, that were well acquainted with the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> that in <HI>India major,</HI> which is from <HI>Mallabar</HI> to <HI>Che&s;macoram,</HI> there are 13 King|domes, 12700 I&s;lands, de&s;olate and un-inhabited. And in <HI>India mi|nor,</HI> which is from <HI>Siambi,</HI> to <HI>Mur|fili,</HI> there are eight Kingdomes be|&s;ide many I&s;lands. And the Com|modities of the&s;e parts are of the be&s;t &s;ort, and probably by the great
<PB N="4" REF="10">
quantities that have been yearly carried thither from <HI>Europe,</HI> there is more &s;ilver then in all the other parts of the world.</P>
<P>And although there is this great|ne&s;&s;e yet we &s;end yearly, but a few &s;hips which belong to the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia,</HI> and Turki&s;h Company.</P>
<P>The trade of <HI>America</HI> is much greater, although it be but with our own Nation, which are &s;eated in <HI>New-England, Virginia, Barba|dos, Chri&s;tophers, Antego, Santey, Crus, Meaguis, Monferat,</HI> and <HI>Bar|moudas,</HI> what el&s;e of that Orbe is in the hands of Spaniards Portu|gals, and Dutch in any con&s;idera|ble place, cannot be traded with by the Engli&s;h, <HI>Africa</HI> almo&s;t an I|land joyning to <HI>A&s;ia</HI> by that nar|row <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> part of <HI>Arabia De&s;erta</HI> neer cut a&s;under by the Red and Mediterranean Seas, hath for its coa&s;ts on the Mediterranean Sea, <HI>Egypt, Barbary,</HI> and a part of <HI>Mau|ritania,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
on the North &s;ea the King|dom of <HI>Morocco, Fe&s;&s;e, Tombuto,</HI> the large Regions of <HI>Giney, Conge,</HI> and Empire of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and from the Cape of <HI>Bona Speranza,</HI> unto the Iland of <HI>Scotia,</HI> the King|dom of <HI>Armeto, Mo&s;ambique, Qui|lioa, Melinde, Magadoxo, Badivis, Ethiopia,</HI> and part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and from thence along&s;t the Red Sea, <HI>Seila, Adel,</HI> and the Empire of <HI>Pre&s;ter John.</HI></P>
<P>And all the&s;e Countries have many Rivers and Ports, and great &s;tore of people living on them. And we trade onely to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Morocco, Fe&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Giney,</HI> and there but little neither, all the other places being left, as <HI>terra in|cognita.</HI></P>
<P>The trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> doth ju&s;tly challenge a greater Commerce then any of the other parts have, although it be the lea&s;t. On this con&s;ideration, the Ports are neer
<PB N="6" REF="11">
adjacent, the people more ingeni|ous in procuring Merchandize, and and their Comodities more in u&s;e with us, and ours more wanting with them, as our broad Cloth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e con&s;iderations, I conclude, that unle&s;&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> there is no equality in the trade of our Nation with the other parts of the World.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>The &s;econd Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the lo&s;&s;e be not grea|ter then the gaines to &s;ome of the&s;e places.</P>
<P>As the end of all trade and mens carnall thoughts are commonly for &s;ilver and gold, &s;o that Countrey that hath mo&s;t of it is accounted the riche&s;t. And indeed it is almo&s;t all things, for he that hath enough of that, cannot lack any worldly thing that can be had.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11">
Upon which, I conceive, that the principall ayme of all forreign trade &s;hould be to bring much of it in, and carry little of it out of our Countrey, and that Commerce that doth not is managed to the di&s;advantage of our Nation, and ought to be rejected.</P>
<P>And upon examination it will be found, that the greate&s;t trade which we drive in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which is to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> either by the way of <HI>Bagdet, Caro,</HI> and the red Seas, or Cape of <HI>Bona Speranza,</HI> is with ready money.</P>
<P>I can with confidence &s;ay, it may be managed &s;o to the advan|tage of our Nation, that we may have their Commodity for ours, and their Ports better traded. And whereas it hath been the practi&s;e of our people to carry much money thither, we may now fetch it home again.</P>
<P>And the trade of <HI>America</HI> is pre|judiciall,
<PB N="8" REF="12">
very di&s;hone&s;t, and high|ly di&s;honourable to our Nation. It is prejudiciall, in that it carrieth a|way daily &s;uch men as might &s;erve their Country, either in fighting to defend it at home, or el&s;e a|broad.</P>
<P>'Tis di&s;honourable, in that we are upbraided by all other Nations that know that trade for &s;elling our own Countreymen for the Com|modities of tho&s;e places. And, I affirm, that I have been told by the Dutch and others, that we Engli&s;h were wor&s;e than the Turks, for that they &s;old &s;trangers onely, and we &s;old our own Countreymen. And it is well known, that people in au|thority, and &s;ome that profe&s;&s;e much to Chri&s;tianity of tho&s;e parts, will hang a man for &s;elling or ta|king away an Indian that wor&s;hip|eth the Devill, when at the &s;ame time they allow others, and will them&s;elves buy of their own Na|tion,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
which have mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly been &s;tolne out of their Countrey.</P>
<P>And 'tis di&s;hone&s;t, if murther be &s;o, for when they have by Spi|rits or lying tales, forced them aboard the &s;hips, in their tran&s;por|tation onely, there is yearly many &s;tarved to death, tho&s;e that remain are &s;old to tho&s;e that wil give mo&s;t for them; &s;ome for fourteen years, others for ten, and le&s;&s;e, but the lea&s;t four: and it were better for them to &s;erve fourteen years with the Turks, then four in the Planta|tions with mo&s;t of the Ma&s;ters in tho&s;e places, e&s;pecially in <HI>Virginia,</HI> for be&s;ides, their being back-beaten and belly-beaten, it is three to one if they live out their &s;ervitude, by rea&s;on of the unwhol&s;omene&s;&s;e of the Countreys.</P>

<P>It is not hard to imagine, when we &s;ee the greatne&s;&s;e of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and the little Commerce that we have with them, that it may well be increa&s;ed.

<PB N="11" REF="13">
<HEAD>The fourth Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>Is, how it hath been hindred, and what is the let in the growth of it?</P>
<P>The people generally &s;uppo&s;e 'tis the danger of the &s;eas, and the little &s;ecurity in the parts abroad, for the Merchants Goods and &s;hips. In an&s;wer, I affirm, the trade of the Hollanders never flouri&s;hed &s;o as in time of War, and their ene|mies were more &s;trong at Sea then ours, upon which we may conclude, it is not that that is the true cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I finde the&s;e other cau&s;es to be the ob&s;truction in the trade. The fir&s;t is, the Companies of our Nation, which &s;ort of peo|ple I account a benefit or a lo&s;&s;e, according as they are e&s;tabli&s;hed and managed, in which the Com|panies of <HI>England</HI> have been de|fective, which appeareth in the
<PB N="12" REF="14">
generall damages which them&s;elves and Adventurers have had with them, and few publick memorials they have erected at home or abroad that hath appeared a publick good, but divers acts have &s;eemed the contrary.</P>
<P>And on particulars we finde, there are five Companies that are well in years among&s;t us, the other which was of later e&s;tabli&s;hment, which really was the be&s;t (the <HI>Giney</HI> Company) is di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>And to omit the general damage that all the <HI>Inland</HI> Companies do to our Nation, which is from my purpo&s;e now to treat of, the five Companies of exportation are: fir&s;t, the Cloth Company that trade into <HI>Holland, Hamborough,</HI> the <HI>Bal|tick</HI> Seas, and el&s;ewhere, with all the white Clothes exported the Kingdome.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, the third the <HI>Turkey,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the fourrh the <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> the fifth the Company of <HI>Greenland, alias Grinland.</HI> Of which, I conceive, the Cloth Company to be the greate&s;t Monopoly, for this cau&s;e. Be&s;ides the ingro&s;&s;ing of the commodity of white Cloth to them&s;elves, which is a great barre to the pri|viledge of the Nation. The car|rying of them out of the Laud, is a pernicious thing to five &s;orts of men, Merchants, Seamen, Cloth-dre&s;&s;ers, Sheare-men and Diers, which la&s;t people receive the grea|te&s;t damage, although they were accounted anciently the Staple-ma|nufacture of our Nation. The pre|judice to the Cloth-dre&s;&s;ers and Diers, appears in the carrying away from them forty Clothes white more then are worked at home, by which it appears, that where there is one imploy'd now in that cour&s;e, there might be forty, if it were ma|naged at home.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
And all that ever I heard that the Company could &s;ay for them&s;elvs is, that the trade of making white Cloth would be &s;poiled, for the Dutch and Poles if they could not have it white would forbear buy|ing of it. But I am &s;ure the Mer|chants buy it beyond the &s;eas for their profit, and not to &s;et their Country-men at worke, or el&s;e they differ much from them of the Company. And if they want it to trade with, they will have it as well dre&s;t by us; as their own Na|tion; but if they be ob&s;tinate and will not buy it, we &s;hall gaine and not lo&s;e, for our Sea-men and Merchants that make &s;hort Voy|ages with &s;mall profit will then vent it to tho&s;e parts which now have it at the &s;econd hand from them, that buy it white from us, and &s;o the Merchants will make two profits in &s;tead of one; and the Sea-men longer Voyages.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company come home to this que&s;tion in that it hath lo&s;t many advantagious places there, and impoveri&s;hed many that adventured with them, giving them after fifteen or &s;ixteen yeares forbearance of their money in|&s;tead of 70li. yearly, which the Dutch give mo&s;t yeares to their Adventurers 70li. for their princi|pall. And the Dutch, lately to re|new their Lea&s;e, which not long &s;ince was neer expired, being but for 21 yeares at the fir&s;t, com|pounded with the States Generall to have it renewed for &s;o much longer for the &s;umme of eight hundred thou&s;and pound paid to them, and five hundred thou&s;and to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company, which the States owed the &s;aid <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>And whereas the Dutch Com|pany hath whole Countries, divers I&s;lands, Cities, Ca&s;tles, Forts, &amp;c.

<P>The cau&s;e of the Dutches flou|ri&s;hing, our Companies &s;ay, was there &s;tock exceeding the Engli&s;h; But it will appear, upon examina|tion, that the Engli&s;h Company had &s;ixteene hundred thou&s;and pounds under writ for, when the Dutch had but eight.</P>

For the Ports of the Grand Seignour are many; the chief being <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> there are on the coa&s;ts of the &s;eas in his Territories, the Provin|ces of <HI>Arcadia, Accea, Pelipone&s;us, Epirus,</HI> part of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the I&s;land of the <HI>Archipelagus</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in the Mediterranean Sea on the coa&s;t of the <HI>Begler-Beg&s;hip</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Troas,</HI> the fair &s;citua|ted Town of <HI>Symrna,</HI> then <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Ports of <HI>Jewry,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the trade of the great City of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> where there might be more

<P><PB N="20" REF="18">
The <HI>Greenland</HI> Company hath as great a &s;hare in oppre&s;&s;ion as the re&s;t, although it is not &s;o eminent in fame, and in this it exceedeth, that whereas the other Compa|nies are a hindrance to &s;uch Mer|chants as might trade (were it not for their Patent) into tho&s;e Coun|tries of their divi&s;ions, this I &s;ay, is not onely a Barre to tho&s;e that would trade to <HI>Greenland,</HI> but hath &s;o much power, as to hinder other Merchants from importing into the Land the Commodities they have from <HI>Greenland.</HI> So that tho&s;e that buy that u&s;efull Com|modity, mu&s;t give their rates for it. And although it be in others a fault to bring it from neerer places to hinder the trade to <HI>Greenland,</HI> yet 'tis reported, they are not bound by this Law, being forced for want of &s;ufficient from <HI>Greenland</HI> to &s;upply the Engli&s;h at &s;econd hand.</P>
<P>Now, as it is clear by this I have
<PB N="21" REF="18">
&s;aid, that the&s;e Companies are a great hinderance to the Com|merce of our Nation. There is al&s;o another, which the Merchants complain of, and that is the Dutch Nation, that daily &s;o in&s;inuate into the trade of all places where ever they are admitted, to the putting by of the Engli&s;h. And were it not that we &s;ell our Countreymen for the Commodity of the Engli&s;h Plantations, I am fully per&s;waded, within a few years, we &s;hould be forced to have what comes from thence at a &s;econd hand from the Dutch: which in rea&s;on &s;eems &s;trange, con&s;idering they export nothing but what they import, and we export much which we need not import, &amp; how tho&s;e that have it at a &s;econd hand, &s;hould &s;ell a thing cheaper then him that hath it at the fir&s;t, &s;eems irrationall, yet they will do it, which is done by our ir|regularity in trade, and the Mer|chants
<PB N="22" REF="19">
that are the great Complay|nants, are the chief cau&s;ers of their own hinderance.</P>
<P>But upon Examination, it will be found, that the principall Com|merce of the whole World is in hands of the Engli&s;h, and the U|nited Provinces. And what we lo&s;e they get. And as it is their great care, by all means, to increa&s;e their own Commerce, though with the ruine of ours, &s;o, I conceive, it is hone&s;t and honourable, to endea|vour our own good, although by their hurt.</P>

<HEAD>The fifth Que&s;tion</HEAD>
<P>Is, Whether there may not be a cour&s;e taken to quicken the trade and Commerce of the Engli&s;h Nation?</P>
<P>As I apprehend the Companies to be a great cau&s;e of hinderance in our trade, with the ill managing of
<PB N="23" REF="19">
the generall trade of our Nation, &s;o I think the&s;e things I have offered, doe in part demon&s;trate it. Where|fore, I conceive, that if they were taken away, with &s;ome irregularity in trade, our Nation would not be found wanting, either in inclination to trade, or abilities for trade to ad|vance our Commerce to what height we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e there may ari&s;e an Objection again&s;t the overthrow of Companies, in regard we &s;ee the Hollanders have a very flouri&s;hing trade in the World, although it be managed by more Companies then we have.</P>
<P>I &s;hall to that and the &s;econd hinderance which is the trade of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> affirme, the fir&s;t con|&s;titution of Companies were, or ought to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed to keep up a trade &s;ubject to alterati|on, without fortification, and &s;trength of &s;hipping, for to tho&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="20">
places that give us an equall en|gagement by oath of Princes, ba&s;&s;adours and Agents con&s;tantly Leger to &s;ee right, and performance of Articles, there is no need of Companies, or el&s;e, why are they not in <HI>Europe?</HI> And where there is this ful a&s;&s;urance 'tis contrary to all &s;ence, that there &s;hould be a mono|poly of the trade, and where it is not a&s;&s;ured this way, or by Forts, we lie at the mercy of tho&s;e Princes we trade with, that permit us but for their profit, and no longer, I con|ceive, it is madne&s;&s;e without a&s;&s;u|rance of fortification, to a&s;&s;ure Mer|chants goods and &s;hips to have any Commerce with &s;uch men or Countreys. And it was for this rea&s;on, that the Companies of <HI>En|gland,</HI> were fir&s;t erected. For it was propo&s;ed that private men ma|king a voyage, and according to the lo&s;&s;e or gain of that continue or for&s;ake the trade, and although it
<PB N="25" REF="20">
were profitable, yet want of abili|ty or will would hinder them from gaining that a&s;&s;urance for the fu|ture, which a joynt &s;tock well ma|naged would do. And although the Hollanders come far &s;hort of that perfection in trade which they might have, yet are they in this ve|ry circum&s;pect. For the Compa|nies of <HI>Holland,</HI> do not only forti|fie in mo&s;t places, where they come, but gain whole Regions and Pro|vinces, which is &s;till managed to the advantage and honour of their Common-wealth. But our Com|panies have &s;o much &s;werved from this intention of their fir&s;t con&s;ti|tuting, that whereas the Dutch keep the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Provinces in awe, we are mi&s;erable &s;laves to them. For if a Prince of <HI>India,</HI> lo&s;eth on the &s;eas by Piracy of En|gli&s;h or any other people of <HI>Europe,</HI> what they have in their Countrey of the Engli&s;h Merchants wil &s;ure|ly,
<PB N="26" REF="21">
make good their le&s;&s;e. Or in ca&s;e an Engli&s;h power, or French, &amp;c. &s;aying, he were Engli&s;h, &s;hould come into the Red Seas, and take &s;hips bound for any <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Port, or <HI>Cameron</HI> land, and de&s;ire trade, &amp; be &s;urprized, and getting free, revenge them&s;elves on the goods and per|&s;ons of the <HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Turkes,</HI> the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turkey</HI> under the Command of the Grand Seig|nour, would &s;urely pay for it in their per&s;ons and goods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greenland</HI> Company was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed to bring in the whole Commerce of the Whale-fi&s;hing into <HI>England,</HI> and with much hone&s;ty might they have barred others from comming thi|ther, in regard, the Engli&s;h were the fir&s;t Di&s;coverers of it, but in|&s;tead of going before others, we come behinde them, and far-&s;hort of the Dutch, which appoint us their leavings, in&s;tead of taking ours.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="21">
The Dutch which is a &s;econd hinderance to us in our Commerce, overtop us very &s;trangely, if wee &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the people, and their Country, which is compre|hended within the title of the Uni|ted Provinces. In which lyeth on|ly <HI>Zealand, Holland; Fri&s;land, U|trick,</HI> and the&s;e Provinces they have entirely, the bigge&s;t of them no greater then <HI>Kent.</HI> They have a little part of <HI>Ea&s;t Flanders, Brabant,</HI> and a good part of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> which places doth not afford them common nece&s;&s;aries, for they have mo&s;t of their fle&s;h from <HI>Emden, Hol&s;ten</HI> and <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> their Corn from the Countreys on the Baltick &s;eas, for their hou&s;ing and &s;hip|ping, their Timber and Iron from <HI>Norway, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Lukeland,</HI> their Hemp, Pitch, and Tar, as we from <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> or the Baltick Seas. And for commodities of exporta|tion to maintain the great trade,
<PB N="28" REF="22">
they have at Sea, their land is as barren and deficient, &s;o that their trade con&s;i&s;ts meerly in what they get from one Nation, and &s;ell to another. And upon a ttue exami|nation it wil be found, what they have gotten from us in the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dies,</HI> and in or about our Country, is the foundation of all their &s;taple manufacture.</P>
<P>And to come to &s;ome perticulars, we find that the Spices of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> the Herrings they have on our Coa&s;ts, and our white Cloth which they dre&s;&s;e and die, is the ve|ry ground of all their Commerce, all which comes to them for little, or at lea&s;t, no vi&s;ible payment. For we get nothing for our. Herrings nor for the Spices, they have from tho&s;e places, which formerly were ours, and though they &s;peak of their paying for them to &s;ome of our Nation, yet it is not vi&s;ible to us. And the white Cloth, they
<PB N="29" REF="22">
have at the third part they make of it. And although with the&s;e, and the other Commodities of our Countrey, as Stockings, cour&s;e Cloth, Stuffs, &amp;c. they make the mo&s;t of their trades, yet for tho&s;e they buy from us, they have with|out any ju&s;t exception. Although it were nece&s;&s;ary, we did make the be&s;t u&s;e of our native Commodi|ties, which we mi&s;&s;e as much of, as if we had never known the way of adventuring from our own Coun|trey.</P>
<P>And now I have &s;aid this, it is likely, that there are many will affirm, that they knew as much be|fore, as I relate, but the remedy is not amply propo&s;ed. But I to ex|cu&s;e my &s;elf, &s;ay, that I have been often in di&s;cour&s;e of this &s;ubject, and have not heard as much as I here &s;hew to you.</P>
<P>And the great Phy&s;icians &s;ay, it is harder to finde out the di&s;ea&s;e,

<HEAD>CHAP. 3. <HI>Of Gold, Silver, Quick-&s;ilver, Emraulds, and Pearl.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe gold is engendred in the Mountains, from whence by rains and flouds into the Plains, and rivers, where for the mo&s;t part they find it. That of the plains, is in veines of hard earth that con|teineth part pure grains of gold like pompeon-&s;eeds, which is the be&s;t, but the mo&s;t that is got in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> is in the Rivers, where it is found mixed with the &s;and in pou|der, even as the &s;and it &s;elf. They &s;eparate it from the earth, and &s;and, by wa&s;hing in a bowle of the fa&s;hion of a Barbers ba&s;on. Where
<PB N="40" REF="28">
they finde it in hard veines, they break them with the Hammers, and make them fit to wa&s;h: fir&s;t, putting the earth or &s;and into the ba&s;on, and receiving water into one &s;ide of it, turn it out at the other, untill they have wa&s;hed out the earth from the gold, which as the heavier &s;ub&s;tance remains behind at the bottome of the bowle.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver Mine is found in the earth in veines or branches, much like the Tinne or Cole in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and is worked almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner under the ground.</P>
<P>The way of &s;eparating the &s;ilver from the dro&s;&s;e, is fir&s;t to take the oare, and break it in Hammer-mils, and grind it to powder, then &s;ift it through a Copper &s;ear&s;e, and put it into a furnace, under which they maken fire by degrees, mixing with every fifty quarts of pouder five of &s;alt, and &s;tiring it, together with quick-&s;ilver, which they &s;queeze
<PB N="41" REF="28">
through a piece of holland upon the &s;aid pouder and &s;alt, and when they finde the quick-&s;ilver, &s;uffi|ciently incorporate with the &s;ilver, then they put it altogether in a Cauldron, in which there is water, and a wheel, that going round, turneth out the earth and dro&s;&s;e with the water, the quick-&s;ilver, and &s;ilver, as the more heavy &s;ub|&s;tance remains behind, which they take from the Cauldron, and wa&s;h it after the manner of gold, till they finde it clean from all dro&s;&s;e, and filth, and then putting it into a cloth, they &s;train forcibly from it &s;ome quick-&s;ilver, the remainder being as a leafe of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>And to &s;eparate the &s;ilver from the quick-&s;ilver, they put it into a violent fire, and cover it with an earthen pot of the fa&s;hion of a &s;u|gar loaf, which is al&s;o covered with coals, and kept very hot, and from a hole in the &s;aid pot, to which is
<PB N="42" REF="29">
fa&s;hioned a pipe, like the pipe of a Limbeck, they receive the quick-&s;ilver, which evacuates by the &s;ame pipe, leaving the &s;ilver of the &s;ame form it was put in, but wanting much of the bigne&s;&s;e and waight.</P>
<P>The Quick-&s;ilver and Vermilli|on, is found together in Rocks, or very hard earth. That part that is found to contein the quick-&s;ilver, they break to pieces, and putting it into earthen fire-pots well luted, they &s;et it on a violent fire (made in the <HI>Indies</HI> of &s;traw, which they find to be excellent for that work) what of it evacuateth out of the pot, goeth up, till meeting nothing to receive it, it falleth down cold, in the &s;ame manner we have it. The remainner in the pot, being &s;uffici|ently &s;eparated from the dro&s;&s;e and earth, the fire is taken away, and when it is throughly cold, they open the pot, and poure out the Quick-&s;ilver into leather baggs,
<PB N="43" REF="29">
which keepeth it be&s;t, conveighing it where they plea&s;e in them. Tho&s;e that open the&s;e pots, and &s;tirreth the &s;ilver and it together, in refi|ning the &s;ilver, &s;wallow a pellet of gold, that lying in the &s;tomack, draweth the Quick-&s;ilver, which in time getteth into their bodies, from whence it goeth out with the &s;aid pellet in excrement. And if the pot be not throughly cold, when 'tis open; it is two to one, if they lo&s;e not their teeth or hair, di&s;-figure their no&s;es and faces, and many times utterly &s;poile them|&s;elves. Wherefore, they are very cautious in this action.</P>
<P>The Emraulds are in great a|bundance in divers parts of the Spani&s;h Countreys, they get them in veines of &s;tone, that is almo&s;t like chry&s;tal, &s;ome as big as a hazel nut, and of &s;everall colours, as whiti&s;h, green and white, and the mo&s;t perfect ab&s;olute green.</P>

Tobacco, which I think to be more naturall to the Countrey then any other thing.

but I conceive it to be the changea|blene&s;&s;e of the weather, which is mighty extream in heat and cold, and as various as the wind both Winter and Summer. The next cau&s;e is the Swamps, &s;tanding-wa|ters and Mari&s;hes, and mighty &s;tore of Rivers, and low lying of the land. There is two other pernicious companions that haunt the Engli&s;h inhabitants, the one is the di&s;ea&s;e, called the Country Duties, which they originally caught of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and the cure is the &s;ame they u&s;e in <HI>England</HI> for the French Pox, it being almo&s;t alike. The other is the Rattle-&s;nake, &s;o called, for the rattle in her taile, who&s;e bitings are pre&s;ent death. And this ver|mine in the Summer is &s;o &s;tirring that they are in the fields, woods, and commonly in their hou&s;es, to their great anoyance, yet this mor|tality doth rather harden the peo|ples hearts, then bring them to

God, for I think they are the far|the&s;t from con&s;cience and morall hone&s;ty, of any &s;uch number to|gether in the world.

The <HI>Virginia</HI> bread is commonly of Millet, called Poane. And if the &s;ervants have enough of that, their complaint wil procure no remedy. The Rivers and Creeks afford much fi&s;h in Summer, and furze in the woods, good &s;tore of Deer and Turkeys in Winter, and fowl by the water-&s;ide in divers places, and yet is pro|vi&s;ion &s;o &s;carce that they are all the year furni&s;hed with fi&s;h and pea&s;e, and bisket from <HI>New Eng|land.</HI> The great re&s;ort of &s;hipping is in winter, for then is the Tobac|co &s;truck into cask, and fit for &s;ale.</P>
