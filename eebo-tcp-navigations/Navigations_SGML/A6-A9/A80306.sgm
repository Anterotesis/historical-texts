<P>If <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and your Holine&s;&s;e have ended, ob&s;erve the an&s;wer of the Spani&s;h &s;onne, no Germane Prelates, nor Bavaria can doe it, nor King of Pole, your &s;elfe, nor any man, nor Florence Duke, nor Brabant joind with Flaunders, nor Cantons, Switzers, nor the greate&s;t Catholicke if all were joyned in one, yet could they not with all their force that can bee got by them bring timely &s;uccour a|gain&s;t the combination tho&s;e Almaines, Graves, have in every land, ex|pect no helpe from Venetia or Savoy, who deadly hate and feare the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, I looke for no helpe from my brother France, for if

Thy Au&s;trian &s;ubjects are infected al&s;o with <HI>Luthers</HI> here&s;ie, and have for&s;aken the Papall dignity, and may combine with their fellow Lutherans, and if thou do&s;t &s;end to Thracia for &s;uccour, the faithle&s;&s;e Turke (thou know|e&s;t) will not from A&s;ia, Spaine, thou mu&s;t helpe, or what will <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> doe, and how can Rome helpe Spaine, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> al&s;o having &s;o many places to &s;upply which &s;tands in need? wherefore doubtle&s;&s;e, if I &s;hall cau&s;e India Armies to be recald from thence, and our Italian forces march from us, leave Millaine, Naples, and our &s;ilver fountaines un|guarded, naked, and march over the hills through Gri&s;&s;ons Countrey, leave the &s;trength of Spaine, or venture our Armado once more to nar|row &s;eas, and &s;o lo&s;e more at once then we have got in three&s;core years before, then thou at Vienna, I at Arragon may &s;have our heads &amp; turn Monks, you count your friends but doe not count your foes, who&s;e &s;trength, who&s;e numbers you cannot quel, the Northerne tract of Eu|rope from Britaine, tending to la&s;t as farre as Tran&s;ilvania, &s;ave Hol|land and &s;ome other of their owne trifles (Oh me) in foure&s;core years how they are growne you &s;ee, three Kingdomes, England, Scotland, Ireland be, with Denmarke, Norway, Sweden, &s;ix be&s;ides tho&s;e two which they have won being eight in all, and our Kings are but three, the number of their Princes, Dukes and Earles, with their free Lords and States are a great number, be&s;ides their many Pal&s;|graves, and their Mootgraves, with all their Landgraves, and their Burgraves; and as their numbers, &s;o their &s;pirits are made great with hopes of their prodigious &s;tarre which blazed over Germany the la&s;t December, portending change of State, and their expo&s;itions and their combinations of &s;ituations, times and Scepters; and of Rome, of Ba|bell, and of hills and dales, of bea&s;ts of Dragons, and &s;uch fearefull things wherewith they cheare them&s;elves, and triumph as though they would give us all the overthrow: the eleventh and twelfth of <HI>E&s;dras</HI> they apply again&s;t the Imperiall Monarchy, and that the Lion com|ming from the wood is under&s;tood of the King of Sweden, and that the Lion &s;hould the Eagle foile, and in triumphant &s;ort divide the
<PB REF="3"> &s;poile. The Rebels thus interpreteth this, whereby the Catholiques are vext greatly; therefore they &s;ay that as the Eagles they doe &s;pread them&s;elves ore many Catholique Kings, even &s;o the Lyon in the Armes of Sweed, will &s;ure protect tho&s;e Heretiques from feare, and Sued (they &s;ay) turn'd Anagram, is the Chri&s;tian <HI>Macchabeus;</HI> they further &s;ay <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> is his name. The fame of this mans fortune doth &s;o much them cheri&s;h, that their good &s;ucce&s;&s;e makes me now to &s;tand in feare to be put downe, wherefore I pray you &s;ee now if any meanes be left to &s;et me free.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>An uncouth &s;hivering makes my blood to chill, and &s;trange amazement doth fill my &s;inewes; I wonder much that they are &s;o skil|full again&s;t us, thus to apply this Prophe&s;ie: I al&s;o doe admire how they would frame &s;uch Anagrams on Swede; but though tho&s;e hopes doe cheare their froward mindes, yet let our Emperours thoughts contemne all feare, for it is not Fortune turning of her wheele can make our noble re&s;olutions &s;tagger: I wonder much tho&s;e blinde He|retiques cannot remember in their hardned minde, how I am on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Chaire &s;o plac't that they can neither wa&s;te nor ruinate the place which is within my grave protection, though (for a time) they put them to perplexity, for I will &s;o trouble them with my band of Je&s;uits, they &s;hall not with&s;tand them; doubt not but I will finde a Stratagem to &s;ave Romes <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> and the Diadem of Spaine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King of Sp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But holy Father I am certified that they deride your Councell and Policy, and how of you they make an Anagram, can frame the be&s;t and bettere&s;t of their wits: as thus,

<P>Mo&s;t &s;acred Pa&s;tor of the flock of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>They &s;ay thou art not fixed on the Rocke, but I &s;u&s;pect that they are all inclin'd, that they doe believe in minde what they &s;ay, alas for Rome, alas for <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> alas for <HI>Philip,</HI> mu&s;t I be forced to with|&s;tand my owne, the Emperours, and the Churches enemies, and &s;o lo&s;e both my &s;elfe, the Church, and Empire all at once!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they finde out &s;uch &s;trange prodigies to fill the Cath|liques with feare and doubt; Ile make them know that I am fixed firme upon Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and &s;hall never be ca&s;t downe, my benediction, or my malediction can rai&s;e a State, or ruine a Nation: The Heretiques on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> doe build their faith, and I am upheld as from his per|&s;on, and from him all power is given unto me, to binde and loo&s;e, to &s;hut and open heaven: And whil&s;t I keepe the Keyes none &s;hall come in that have beene in tho&s;e mad rebellious wars.</P>

<P>No Prince can compare with my lo&s;&s;es, for I have had more then a double &s;hare; great damage have I had in A&s;ia, in Bra|&s;ill,
<PB REF="4"> and in Farnambuck, the furious Rebels have cau&s;ed me to feel with places of importance, their civill hatred to our State and Realme, by foyling, &s;poyling, and ruinating them, my India is &s;urpri&s;ed and taken by them, wherein &s;ub&s;i&s;ted all the hope of Spaine; be&s;ides at Belgia, I have had misfortune, my Towne of Weazell's taken in a trap, the Bu&s;&s;e, a place of great importance lo&s;t, long time defended, with exceeding charge, and late that unrecoverable blow in Zealand, where our forces all were broke, Sloopes, Puicks and Lighters, 78. peri&s;hed, 6000. men, tane pri&s;oners, many wounded, 4000. hand Granadoes, and of Bra&s;&s;e 430. peeces was taken, eleven harrells of good money likewi&s;e taken, and many hundreds of our &s;ouldiers &s;lain, with &s;tore of Ammunition, &s;hot, and powder, all lo&s;t in that unlucky expedition; all this pa&s;t the la&s;t September, for which our foes re|joyce, our friends are grieved, while&s;t onely Dunkirke are rude Ren|negadoes, have made bravadoes again&s;t mine enemies, they onely have done things of &s;peciall moment, taken from Merchants and &s;mall fi&s;her boats, and now and then a Collier, or a Catch of Oy&s;ters, &s;eldom meeting with their equalls, for which rare acts their fame abroad is &s;pread, as though they had &s;ubdued and won the world, when every wi&s;e man knowes their Townes and Ships to be but dens of Thieves.

<P>Thus holy Father have you briefly heard the cau&s;e of all our anger and our griefe, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e dangers now related, which &s;o perplext our mindes and hearts, by the&s;e &s;o many lo&s;&s;es, and we feare ere long will befall us; wherefore if Rome have any &s;ercret wi&s;dome laid up in &s;tore for evill times, or evill did make wicked He|retiques feele the power of the Church; then Father now is the time
<PB REF="5"> and houre: Remember how <HI>Fredericke</HI> heretofore frighted thy Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, this may hazard thy fortune more, utterly &s;uppre&s;&s;e thy &s;elfe, the Romane Church, and us, except by &s;ome prime &s;tratagem fetcht from beneath, thou maye&s;t thy &s;elfe and friends from danger keep, for if the&s;e Heretiques be once our ma&s;ters, then farewel Pope and Papall dignity.</P>
