<HEAD>A True NARRATIVE OF THE Great Solemnity OF THE CIRCUMCISION OF MUSTAPHA Prince of <HI>Turkie,</HI> Elde&s;t Son of SULTAN MAHOMET Pre&s;ent EMPEROUR of the <HI>Turks.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe&s;e la&s;t five months I have &s;pent in <HI>Adria|nople:</HI> it's plea&s;antly &s;cituated on the ri&s;ing and top of an ea&s;ie Hill, which to the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> gives the pro&s;pect of a large Plain, where the eye is not lo&s;t, but bounded with the Mountains of <HI>Haemus;</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> are &s;mall Hills. It's watered with three Rivers (the chiefe&s;t <HI>He|brus)</HI> which often uniting and &s;eparating their &s;treams,
<PB N="2" REF="3"> make many I&s;lands, capable of what the mo&s;t refined Luxury could plant or build; but Spring-Gardens and Walks, adorn'd with Ladies and Gallants, are things un|known to us <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>I have now told you all that's good: For this airy plea&s;ure of the eye is lo&s;t in &s;o many &s;olid inconvenien|cies, that I never yet was in any City more unea&s;ie, nay more in&s;uportable: the Buildings (except a Mo&s;que or two) &s;o mean and contemptible, that they would di&s;|grace a poor Village; the Water bad, Wine wor&s;e, the Streets and all Avenues to the City &s;o crouded with Carts, Dunghills, and Carrion, that nothing can be more trouble&s;ome or offen&s;ive to the &s;ight and &s;cent. In a word, what the Riches and Invention of Mankinde did contri|bute to make <HI>Rome</HI> delightful and glorious, the &s;tupidity and fordidne&s;s of the&s;e people have outvied in the rever&s;e, making this place the Metropolis of filth and inconveni|ence.</P>
<P>Our arrival here was the 10 of <HI>May;</HI> the 15th began the Fe&s;tivals for the Circumci&s;ion of the young Prince. In a large Piazza, or rather Field before the Seraglio, were pitch'd the Tents of the Grand Signior, Vi&s;ier, and other great men; which made a &s;ide and half of the Square: Another &s;ide and half was taken up with Lamps hung upon Ropes, and fa&s;tened to Poles, di&s;po&s;ed into &s;everal figures of Ships, Buildings, and Woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were changed every night; others as they u&s;e in <HI>Egypt</HI> at their rejoycing when they cut the <HI>Nile.</HI> The fourth &s;ide was the Seraglio, where the women had the convenience of &s;eeing through Lettices.</P>
<P>The Show begun in the afternoon (the morning being &s;pent in Entertainments.) The Grand Signior &s;itting in an elevated place by his Tent, much like a Summer-hou&s;e in our Gardens, which over looked all, received the Pre|&s;ents brought him by the <HI>Ba&s;ha's,</HI> and all the Officers of the Empire, and all the Arts of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="3"> were not left to the liberty and genero&s;ity of the Pre|&s;enter, but they were taxt what they &s;hould give, and an Officer appointed to &s;urvey the quality of them; which if not approved, was returned, and perhaps augmented: for in this Country it's no ill manners to <HI>look a gift-Hor&s;e in the Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The Mechanicks and &s;ome of the Souldiery were e|very day entertain'd in a great Tent with a Turki&s;h Fea&s;t; after were antick Dances in &s;everal Habits, Singing and Dancing with mo&s;t ob&s;cene Ge&s;ticulations, Jack-pudding, and Punchinello's repre&s;entations, Wre&s;tling, Rope-dan|cing, fears of Activity and Strength; all the&s;e promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly in the <HI>Area</HI> of the Square. Had there been but a Noi&s;e, Rabble, and abominable Pigs head, nothing could have been an exacter Scene of <HI>Bartholomew-fair.</HI></P>
<P>At night a row of Poles, about a mans height, were &s;tuck in the ground; on the top were Hoops of Iron, in which burnt Pine-wood with a brisk and lively flame, which with the Lamps, gave a delightful and magnificent pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>About an hour in the night began the Fire-works, which were plentiful, and not ami&s;s; though I think tho&s;e I have &s;een at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;urpa&s;s them: one &s;ort indeed I never &s;aw, which was a great Ba&s;on like a Mortar-piece fixt into the Ground and filled with Wild-fire, which &s;ent out a violent &s;tream of fire, with a hideous noi&s;e, a great height. It was an Object equally terrible and delightful. The&s;e were the con&s;tant Diverti&s;ements all the time of the So|lemnity.</P>
<P>The 25th, the Mufty, Vi&s;ier, and all the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> and great Officers, with the <HI>Janizaries</HI> walking before, and the <HI>Chiaux</HI> a hor&s;e-back attended the Prince, who was &s;o adorned or over-laden with Jewels, both him&s;elf and his Hor&s;e, that one might &s;ay, he carri'd the Value of an Empire about him.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P> The 27th, which was <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Birth day, he accom|pani'd his Father to the Mo&s;chea: here was no &s;olemn Cavalcade, onely the Grand Signior's own Retinue; and though it was le&s;s in number far than the Cavalcade, yet adju&s;ted neater and Court-like; the Grand Signior's Footmen and Pages being very rich in Clothes and Jew|els.</P>
<P>This evening the Prince was Circumcis'd in the arms of his Father; he is about eleven years old, of a good A&s;pect, his name <HI>Mu&s;tapha.</HI> About two thou&s;and o|thers were cut at this Solemnity, who had Money and a Quilt from the Grand Signior. It was done publickly in the Tents, and any one <HI>Turk</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> admitted to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the 5th this Solemnity was concluded with Hor&s;e-races. After ten days repo&s;e, began the Fea&s;ts for the Marriage of the Grand Signior's Daughter, of about &s;e|ven years old, unto the <HI>Mu&s;&s;aip</HI> or Favourite, who by the Tefterdar, or Lord Trea&s;urer (who was the Compare) in a &s;olemn &s;how &s;ent his Pre&s;ents to her, thirty Mules laden with Sugar-plums and Sweet-meats, figures of &s;eve|ral &s;orts of Birds and Bea&s;ts of Sugar, &s;o ill-favouredly repre&s;ented, that they could not be &s;aid to break the Law again&s;t making Images, though the Solemnity of the time had not di&s;penced with it. Fifty &s;ix men, each with five more Ve&s;ts of Cloth of Gold, Satten, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then her Jewels, &s;everal Suits very rich; five led Hor&s;es with rich Furni|ture of Pearls and precious Stone, and at la&s;t Coaches with Slaves.</P>
<P>On the 19th of <HI>June</HI> was the Vi&s;ier, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a &s;olemn Calvalcade to accompany the Pre&s;ents the Grand Signior gave her: Eighty &s;ix Mules laden with rich Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, very rich Habits for her, and Jewels of all &s;orts, twelve Coaches with Slaves, and &s;ix and thirty black Eu|nuchs.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P> And the 23 was the la&s;t Cavalcade of all the great men to attend her from the Seraglio to her Husbands hou&s;e: They were in a clo&s;e Coach plated with Silver, attended with five and twenty others. At la&s;t came the <HI>Ha&s;&s;aki,</HI> or Queen-regents Coach, attended with ten more; to e|very one of the&s;e Coaches were two black Eunuchs. In a great Court-yard of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;aip</HI>'s Palace were repeated all the Sports and Fire-works that were before, at which the Grand Signior was a con&s;tant Spectator. Be&s;ides, there was a Rope fa&s;tned to a high Steeple, whence &s;everal men came flying down: one having a Boy tied to his back with a Drum, the Rope broke; but being neer the ground, and falling on another man, they had none of them any con|&s;iderable hurt. The mo&s;t remarkable, was a man that walked up a Rope fa&s;tned to the &s;ame Steeple, forward and backward; and another man that upon a high loo&s;e Rope hanging by his hand, his body extended, &s;wung him&s;elf over twelve times, without &s;top, or touching any thing.</P>
<P>But too much of the&s;e trifles, though the Grand Sig|niour was much delighted with them, and made them be continued many more days than were intended. He took that fancy to a Gyp&s;ie-boy that &s;wang and danced, as he hath him in the degree of a Favourite, being taken into the Seraglio, and pre&s;ented by the Great <HI>Ba&s;ha's.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;&s;aip</HI> that hath married the Grand Segnior's Daughter, is a man meddles in no bu&s;ine&s;s, nor is thought to be much capable of it; for being Chimacham in the Vi&s;iers ab&s;ence, he &s;hewed no great abilities. The Grand Signior takes him for a con&s;tant Companion in all his Diverti&s;ements, and hath a &s;trong affection to him; which time does not impair, but rather augment; he being a Prince mo&s;t con&s;tant where he fixes. You would think this Marriage would make him happy, but it's quite con|trary; for it not onely cuts him off in his plea&s;ures to which he is indulgent, he being forced to di&s;charge all his women, even his own Si&s;ters; but it ruines his fortune,
<PB N="6" REF="5" MS="y"> both by the expence in maintaining her while &s;he lives, and &s;hould &s;he die, he mu&s;t refund to the Trea&s;ury all he hath had with her, be&s;ides four millions (according to common report) of Dollars, which is her Dote; which he is &s;o far from an ability of, that he cannot pay his pre&s;ent Debts. She hath good proofs of his abilities another way, he having, it's &s;aid, two and thirty Children.</P>
<P>To our own private Affairs, his Excellency my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador Sir <HI>John Finch</HI> had all &s;atisfaction, and hath obtained very advantageous additions to our Capitulati|ons: but they being things Mercantile, and though not beyond, yet beneath your knowledge, I &s;hall not particu|larize.</P>
<P>We had a very hot Plague: My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador re|tired to a Village, but it &s;oon arrived there; &s;o he lived in his Tents till the Sickne&s;s got among the Servants, of whom five died: then he returned to the Village; Mr. <HI>North</HI> and I &s;tuck to the City, where, though in our &s;treet onely two hou&s;es were free, be&s;ides our own, and the two adjoyning had five &s;ick on the one, and two on the other &s;ide; yet God be prai&s;ed we and our Servants pa&s;|&s;ed well along the Road: and here it's not much le&s;s. Sir <HI>Thomas Baines</HI> my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador's Companion that attended him in his Chamber, three days after our ar|rival, was taken, and in three more died; he is the onely Engli&s;h man hath been vi&s;ited. His Excellency hath re|tired upon this, a little way out of Town, for &s;ome time.</P>
