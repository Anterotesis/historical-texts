<P>_THe art of Navigation is a Science by which through certaine rules you may &s;teere a Shipp over the Seas from one place to another, and is not improperly devided into two parts, to witt, into ordinary and extra|ordinary Navigation. The ordinary Navigation u&s;eth no other In&s;truments, then the Compa&s;&s;e and &s;ounding Plummet, as principally con&s;i&s;ting in experience and practice, in knowledge of Lands and Corners, how they are different in Points and di&s;tances and are knowne from the Sea, in depths, &s;hoales qualityes of grounds: the running and falling of Streames! upon what point the Moone maketh high water in every &s;everall place &amp; &s;uch like which in part are learned from the information of ex|perienced Pilots, but mo&s;t out of our owne experience.</P>
<P>Extraordinary Navigation u&s;eth be&s;ides the fore&s;ayd ordinary practi&s;e divers other private In&s;truments and rules which mu&s;t bee taken out of A&s;tronomy and Co&s;|mography.

In what&s;oever part of the Heaven the moon is Eclip&s;ed or touched by the Shad|dow of the earth, that Shaddow &s;eemeth alwayes round. If the earth were foure &s;quare, three corned, or of any other forme, then the Shaddow of the moone &s;hould bee al&s;o foure &s;quare, three cornerd or &s;ome other forme!

<P>THat the earth &s;tandeth in the middle of the World, may clearely bee under&s;tood by what is hereafter &s;poken: for if &s;oo bee that the Globe of the earth &s;tood not in the middle of the World, but that the heaven was nearer it on one &s;ide, it would come to pa&s;&s;e, that the &s;tars in their daily cour&s;es &s;hould bee nearer on one &s;ide of the earth then on the other, and by that meanes &s;hould appe|are to our &s;ight to bee greater on one &s;ide of the earth then on the other: likewi&s;e if that part of the heaven next to the earth were a boveus, we &s;hould then &s;ee le&s;&s;e then halfe of the heaven according to in&s;truction of the fir&s;t Fi|gure: and on the contrary when that part of the heaven farthe&s;t from us were above us wee &s;hould then &s;ee more then halfe of the Heaven according to the In&s;truction of the &s;econd Figure.

That the earth &s;tands in the middle of the World: From thence is likewi&s;e to bee marked that the Globe of the earth is no more to bee likened by the Heavens then a point without thickne&s;&s;e for if the earth had any thick|ne&s;&s;e in re&s;pect of Heaven, wee &s;hould (&s;tanding upon the earth) by that rea&s;on not &s;ee halfe of the Heaven ac|cording to Demon&s;tration of the 4 Figure.</P>

If therefore you will then &s;ett the Sonnes Declination by day tables it is needfull to make foure &s;undry tables of foure &s;uch following yeares.

And &s;eeing that it is betweene the 20 of March, and the 23 of September (that the Son is by northwards of the Line) &s;oo comes it to pa&s;&s;e that the Declination is Northerly.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The &s;econd Example.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the 12 of February in the Leape yeare, I de&s;ire to know the Sonnes declination &s;eeke therefore in the Table of Leape yeares toe Month of February, and count in the fir&s;t Collumne to the 12 day, and you find there by it 13 degrees and 14 minutes for the Declina|tion of the Sonne on that day; &s;eeing that it is be|tweene the 23 of September and 20 of March, that the Sonne goeth by South the Line, The Declination is then Southerly.</P>
<P>Now follow the Tables of the Sonnes Declination reckoned properly, upon the length of the earth or Me|ridian of Englands Landt-End, becau&s;e that this length is u&s;ed mo&s;t by our Netherland &s;eamen as well in running, upon the Channell of the Sea, as along&s;t the Coa&s;ts of France, Portugal and Spaine.</P>

<P>LOok how many degrees and minutes the Line is rai&s;ed above the Horizon; ju&s;t &s;o many degrees and minutes are there between the point right over your head, called the Zenith and the Pole, and thence it followeth, that as many degrees and minutes as there bee betweene the Zenith and the line, ju&s;t as many are there from the Ho|rizon to the Pole; that is to &s;ay, &s;o many degrees is the Pole elevated, therefore when we &s;ay we are in &s;uch a height, wee under&s;tand that wee are &s;o many degrees on the north or the &s;outh&s;ide of the line.

<P>IF a man would ob&s;erve the height of the Sunne, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he know how many foot he &s;tands above the water, for the higher a man &s;tand the farther hee is from the Horizon, becau&s;e that from the eye to the Ho|rizon, is 60 degrees, if wee &s;tand waterpas, as they call it; but if he &s;tand higher then the water, as is &s;ayd, it will bee more then 60 degrees to the Horizon; And to mend this fault, I have here placed a table, thereby to know whether wee &s;tand highe, then the water or no; and how many minutes difference it makes, and al&s;o how much neerer the eye the Cro&s;&s;e &s;tandeth, then adding the min. to that which the Cro&s;&s;e &s;tandeth below the Zenith, &s;o &s;hall you mend the fault, that is to &s;ay, that you &s;ee the cro&s;&s;e &s;o many minutes downward, look on the table following.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t you mu&s;t know that the way of the Sonn in the heaven is immoveable with the fixed Starres with the which it is every day once turned about from ea&s;t to we&s;t without change, but onely that the Sonne doth contrary wi&s;e run this fore&s;ayd yearely cour&s;e from we&s;t to ea&s;t Whereby hee in his daily cour&s;e, commeth &s;o farr behind, that hee in a whole yeare goeth one cour&s;e le&s;&s;e then the fixed Starres: and that the fixed Starres turne once more about in a yeare then the Sunn, &s;o that they every day come 4 min. &s;ooner to the divi&s;ion, that commeth every weeke to about halfe an houre &amp; every month 2 houres, which that it may the better bee under&s;tood, wee will make it evident by an example taken from the &s;tarre cal|led Syrius, or Canis Major the great dogge, which alwayes followeth a little after the Image of the Gyant Orion and his Girdle, which is called the three Kings, which appeare a little over the great Dogge, it is the greate&s;t and cleare&s;t of all the fixed Starres, which for the mo&s;t part is knowne unto all Sea-faring men, his declination is Southward from the Line 16 degrees, and 13 minutes.</P>
<P>And it is &s;outh upon the 24 of Ianuary new &s;tile, at ten of the clock at night. The 23 of Februaty at 8 of the clock at night. The 28 of March as &s;ix of the clock at night. The 30 of April at foure of the clock in the evening. The 30 of May at two of the clock afternoone. The 28 of Iune at 12, of the clock at noone, even with the Sun. The 28 of Iuly, at ten of the clocke before noone. The 29 of Augu&s;t at eight of the clocke before noone. The 1 of October at &s;ix of the clock in the morning. The 12 of November at foure of the clock in the morning. The 1 of December at two of the clock in the morning. The 28 of December at 12 of the clock at night.</P>
<P>Whereby every man may ea&s;ily reckon at what houre and time this Starre is &s;outh every day in the yeare, as well in the day time when you cannot &s;ee it, as in the night when wee may &s;ee it. And if you de&s;ire to know the like touching all the re&s;t of the fixed Starres upon every day in the yeare, then marke what was &s;aid before, upon what houre of the day before &s;et downe, the great Dogge com|meth into the South, and by the Tables hereafter follow|ing, touching the declination of the Stars, marke how long time the Starte you &s;eeke for, commeth into the South before or after the great Dogge, &amp; by that meanes you &s;hall finde the ju&s;t and perfect time that you de&s;ire.</P>

<P>On the 10 of April, in the evening, in the &s;outh, I&s;e the heart of the Lyon, who&s;e right a&s;cen&s;ion is 147 degr. the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Sunne on that day is 19 degr. take tho&s;e from the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Star, there remaines 128 degrees, and the&s;e devided by 15, I finde 8 houres, 8 de|grees over plus, and for as much as 15 degrees make one houre, every degree will make 4 minutes, the 8 degrees over plus, make 32 minutes of an houre, it will be than at that time 8 houres, 32 minutes from the noone tyde.</P>

<P>ON the 5 of November in the night I finde in the &s;outh the Star Aldebaran, the &s;outh eye of the Bull, who&s;e right a&s;cen&s;ion is 64 degrees: the Sunnes right a&s;cen&s;ion on that day 220 degr. which is more then that of Aldebaran, therefore I add to the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Srar 360 degrees, it makes 424 degrees, the Sunnes right a&s;cen|&s;ion being taken from this, there remains 204 degr. which is the difference betweene the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Sunne and the Star afore&s;aid, which being devided by 15 you &s;hall finde 13 houres, 8 degrees, which make 36 minutes, it is then 13 houres 36 minutes from the noone tijde, that is 1 houre, 36 minut. after midnight.</P>
<P>How to finde the a&s;cen&s;ion on any day in the yeere of the Sunne and the Stars, we have here adjoyneth 2 tables, the one of the Sunne, &s;howing from 5 dayes to 5 dayes, the Sunnes a&s;cen&s;ion, out of which you may ea&s;ily finde the &s;ame in other dayes.

<P>Make an even &s;mooth board, and pa&s;te good paper upon it, then draw a &s;trait line upon one edge or &s;ide thereof, as you &s;ee in this figure a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ine marked C A D, then marke another line as you &s;ee it marked B C, that B C A bee a right and ju&s;t halfe &s;quare, then take a good paire of Compa&s;&s;es, and &s;et one foot thereof in the angle mark|ed C, and compas therewith as you &s;ee B E A, &s;o that A E B may bee a right quadrant, or fourth part of a Circle, then devide it into two parts, to E, and then devide the other halfe (which is A E) into 90 parts, or degrees as thus: fir&s;t devide it into 3 parts, and then devide each 3 parts again into 3, and then it wil be divided into 9 parts, which done, devide each of them into two parts, and tho&s;e divi&s;ions or parts divide into 5 parts, and then it will bee divided into 90 parts: then take a &s;traight line? and lay the one end thereof upon the Center C, and &s;o forth up|on every &s;everall point, which you have divided in the Quadrant and then draw lines from the Center C through all the fore&s;aid points, as long as the board will containe them, as you may &s;ee in this figure: which done then your in&s;trument is fully made and prepared to marke your &s;taves there upon. Which to doe, with your compa&s;&s;es take ju&s;t the half length of your Cro&s;&s;e, and &s;et the one foot thereof in the Center, and put the other at F, and doe the like from D right to G, which two points or pricks draw with a &s;traight line unto each other as you &s;ee in the line F and G, and then mark where the line F G is cut through by the lines that come out of the Center through the degrees or points of the quadrant: for tho&s;e cuttings through, &s;hew upon the &s;aid line the right marking of your Cro&s;&s;e-&s;taffe: that is, you mu&s;t marke your Staffe ju&s;t as you &s;ee that the&s;e lines in F G are mark|ed, by the lines that come out of the center and pa&s;&s;e through it, whether the Cro&s;&s;e bee long or &s;hort, you mu&s;t follow the &s;ame order that you are taught in the figure, the line H I is drawne for a &s;horter Cro&s;&s;e then the former, and K L for one that is &s;horter then that, viz who&s;e halfe is ju&s;t &s;o long as the Line C K.</P>

Upon an hard even board which is pa&s;ted with paper draw a &s;traight line as long as your &s;taffe is, and with point compa&s;&s;e take the ju&s;t halfe or the length of your Cro&s;&s;e, whereunto you mean to mark your &s;taffe, and prick it many times along in the &s;aid line as you can: &amp; divide each of the &s;aid lengths into 11000 equall parts, then look upon the table here after in&s;uing, which &s;hewed you how many of tho&s;e points or parts you &s;hall marke for each degree, and that you mu&s;t doe in manner follow|ing, from the end of the &s;taffe, which you will make the eye-end pricke ju&s;t the halfe length of the Cro&s;&s;e, and there make a Cro&s;&s;e &s;troke, from whence prick for every degree &s;o many of the afore&s;aid parts as the table en&s;uing &s;heweth you. As for example, for the fir&s;t degree prick 176 parts, for the &s;econd 355 parts, for the third 538 parts, for the fourth 724 parts, and &s;o forth: Remem|bring that you mu&s;t prick all the lengths of pricks or parts afore&s;aid, from the afore&s;aid cro&s;&s;e &s;troke, which is marked upon the halfe length of the Cro&s;&s;e into 11000 parts, then devide the whole Cro&s;&s;e &s;o, and then take for every degree halfe &s;o many as the Table &s;heweth unto you. And if you cannot doe &s;o, devide halfe the Cro&s;&s;e into a 1000 parts, and then leave the hindermo&s;t letter of the table out, as where you &s;hould for the fir&s;t degree take an 176 parts, take but 17 parts, leaving the la&s;t figure out: but if your cro&s;&s;es be &s;o &s;mal that you can devide the halfe of them into no &s;maller then an hundred parts, then leave out the two la&s;t figures in the table. But you mu&s;t under|&s;tand that the more parts that you devide the cro&s;&s;es into, your markes will fall out &s;o much the better &amp; perfec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 24 <HI>Point.</HI> Of the cutting of the Cro&s;&s;e-&s;taffe, and how a man may helpe and prevent all the defects of the &s;taffe.</HEAD>
<P>THere being a Cro&s;&s;e-&s;taffe well and exqui&s;itely fra|med, according to the doctrine of the former Chap|ter: it falleth out, that certaine ignorant per&s;ens cutoff a peece from the eye end of the Staffe, about a degree or a degree and a halfe, or two degrees long, and can give no other rea&s;on of that their doing but that it mu&s;t be &s;o, and that they have experience that it ought &s;o to be. But
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> que&s;tionle&s;&s;e, &s;eeing they prove by their experience that they doe not find their mea&s;uring with uncutt &s;taves per|fect &amp; right as it &s;hould bee, the fault thereof, is not in the Cro&s;&s;e &s;taves uncut, but in them&s;elves, for that they know not how to u&s;e the &s;taffe aright, nor under&s;tand the true ground thereof. Others that wil &s;eeme wi&s;er than the for|mer, give a rea&s;on thereof: to wit, that the &s;taffe mu&s;t be cut, becau&s;e of the hollowne&s;&s;e of the eye, for that other|wi&s;e the &s;taffe cannot come to &s;tand, &s;o that the end thereof bee conjoyned to the middle point or center of the eye or &s;ight, this rea&s;on hath &s;ome &s;how of truth, but notwith&s;tanding is alike untrue and erroneous: for the &s;taffe may very wel bee &s;et, either on the innermo&s;t or outermo&s;t corner of the eye, &s;o that the &s;ight of the eye may fall to an&s;wer ju&s;t to the end of the &s;taffe: that this is truth we will prove with good rea&s;on as followeth,</P>
<P>Set the great Cro&s;&s;e with the middlemo&s;t upon like de|grees to wit, each upon &s;uch as for that purpo&s;e are mark|ed upon the &s;taffe: then apply the &s;taffe (the Cro&s;&s;es &s;o firmely remaining) unto your eye in &s;uch manner (whether it bee on the innermo&s;t or outermo&s;t corner it is all one) as that you di&s;cerne the ends of the Cro&s;&s;es both above and beneath, ju&s;t over each other, in forme as this figure &s;pecifieth. If then you draw &s;trait lines by the ends of of the Cro&s;&s;es A B and D C they &s;hall meet ju&s;t in the middle point of your &s;ight. And in a&s;much as the Cro&s;&s;es are placed upon like degrees, the lines afore&s;aid &s;hall meet ju&s;t upon the end of the &s;taffe, &s;eeing that the end of the &s;taffe repre&s;enteth the center of the quadrant whereby your &s;taffe is marked.</P>
<P>So then the afore&s;aid lines or ends of the Cro&s;&s;es an&s;wer both ju&s;t upon the end of the &s;taffe, &amp; al&s;o upon the &s;ight, &s;o that it followeth nece&s;&s;arily, and appeareth evidently: that the end of the &s;taffe and the &s;ight meet in one; or to &s;peake properly, both of them &s;tand ju&s;t in the center of the quadrant.</P>
<P>Therefore when&s;oever with the Cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe you will take the height of the Sun, or of any Star, then ob&s;erve diligently: how many degrees it is elevated above the Ho|rizon: and place the two Cro&s;&s;es upon &s;o many degrees: then apply the &s;taffe to your eye in &s;uch manner as that you may &s;ee the ends of the Cro&s;&s;es ju&s;t over each other, according as is taught before: in &s;uch forme then as you finde the &s;taffe to &s;tand to your eye &s;hall you place the &s;taffe (taking away one of the Cro&s;&s;es) when you de&s;ire to mea&s;ure according to &s;uch height: this is a &s;ure rule which will never fayle, neither can you po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;&s;e if you follow it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 25 <HI>Point.</HI> How to finde the height of the Sun by the &s;hadow.</HEAD>
<P>The common Cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe is a very fit in&s;trument to take the height at Sea, as well of the Sunne, as of other &s;tars, but if the Sunne bee very high, wee can not u&s;e it &s;o commodiou&s;ly, becau&s;e the eye can hardly indure the heath and brightne&s;&s;e of it. To avoid this, wee may very conveniently take the height of the Sun by the &s;haddow, in this manner: make a peece or &s;taffe 3 or foure feet long, very &s;mooth, halfe a thumme thicke, broad two or 3 thummes, that it may remaine &s;traight, as you &s;ee in A B in the mid&s;t of the broad &s;ide (ju&s;t at the halfe be|tweene the upper and nether edge line, draw aright) C D,
<PB REF="16"> make a peece like E with a hole F, that it may be put in|to the peece A B. and thru&s;t it to and fro, al&s;o thwart over let there be a &s;mall hole for the eye like G, in &s;uch &s;ort that when this &s;liding peece is fitted to the other, the hole for the eye, may come to &s;tand ju&s;t by the midde&s;t of the line of the peece C D, neither higher nor lower. Make an|other peece like H, and in the midde&s;t of the &s;ame al&s;o a hole for the eye like K, and an hole thwart like I, that &s;o it may be put on the end of the &s;taffe at B, in &s;uch manner that it &s;tand not right, but thwart or corner wi&s;e, as the line B D L &s;heweth, and that the hole K, may &s;tand like the other eyehole G, on the peece E) neither higher nor lower then the line C D, ju&s;t by the point D, or el&s;e you may in place of that eye hole, cut off the Cro&s;&s;e of the lower edge to the line where the eye-hole &s;tandeth, (as you may &s;ee in the Cro&s;&s;e S) at the line XV. make ano|ther Cro&s;&s;e, a foot and a halfe or two foot long, in the forme of M N, with a hole at N, through which it being put into the fore&s;aid peece, that &s;o you may &s;lide it, to and againe, and that it may goe &s;oftly and certaine on it, then make in the lower part of the hole a bra&s;en &s;crue which may bee thru&s;t under again&s;t the peece and &s;huft it clo&s;e to O P. La&s;t of all, make a &s;mal Cro&s;&s;e as Q, with an hole that it may be &s;et on the long Cro&s;&s;e M N, and fa|&s;ten it behinde with a &s;crue &s;o high or low as u&s;e requi|reth, in the end toward the fore part make a flat eare, an

</FIGURE> F, then drow a line from F, to A, the angle F A B is a ju&s;t triangle, and the bow B D E F is a ju&s;t quadrant or fourth part of a circle, the parts B D, D E, E F, divide each in three parts, againe into five, &s;oo &s;hall the qua|drant bee divided into 90 gr. You may divide into le&s;&s;e as halfes, thirds, fourths, if you will. The quadrant being thus divided, lay a ruler, on the end A, &amp; the other end on the point of the other divi&s;ions, &amp; &s;o draw lines from the point A, through al the other points, as long as they may &s;tand on the board, as is to be &s;eene in the figure above.</P>
<PB REF="17">
<P>That being done, the preparation is made; to marke the peece, take fir&s;t the ju&s;t widene&s;&s;e with a paire of Com|pa&s;&s;es, that is betweene EG, the foremo&s;t edge of the long cro&s;&s;e, and A B the outermo&s;t edge of the eare, in the little cro&s;&s;e, as in the figure N^o. 2. and put that on the peece of the point D, on the left roundell inward toward C, on that point draw a thwart line, from thence you &s;hall be|gin to marke, that the widene&s;&s;e betweene the middle line of the &s;taffe, and the under edge of the eare, which is in the uppermo&s;t cro&s;&s;e, as in the fore&s;aid figure N^o. 2. from F tot A, prick that on the quadrant from A toward F in H, and from C to G in I, and draw the line H I. Then ob|&s;erve how all the lines comming from A the center of the quadrant, cutting through this line, even &s;o mu&s;t the peece bee marked beginning at the point C with 90, 80, 70, &amp;c. But if &s;o doing, you cannot get &s;o many degrees on the &s;taffe, as you de&s;ire to have (for your u&s;e) then &s;et the little cro&s;&s;e a third or fourth part lower toward the great cro&s;&s;e at your plea&s;ere, &s;o that the under edge of the eare AB in the figure N^o. 2. may come to &s;tand at MN, then in the place of the length F A take F M, and thru&s;t it in the quadrant of A toward F into K, and from C unto L, and draw the line K L, that then will bee marked as it ought, by cutting the lines, comming from the center through the devi&s;ion of the quadrant, but you mu&s;t take a certaine marke in the long cro&s;&s;e, for to &s;et the little cro&s;&s;e in &s;uch manner as you would u&s;e both marking. But if you would make more markes on the &s;ame peece, you mu&s;t &s;lide that little cro&s;&s;e more netherward and then doe as was &s;aid before, but you may not forget to make cer|taine markes in the long cro&s;&s;e; for to &s;et the little cro&s;&s;e wel according to the marking, which you de&s;ire to u&s;e.</P>
<P>To marke this cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe from tables more perfectly, draw on an even board pa&s;ted with paper a right or &s;traight line, as long or longer then the &s;taffe that you de|&s;ire to marke. You &s;hall with the compa&s;&s;e take the wide|ne&s;&s;e of the &s;taffe, between the middle line, and the ne|thermo&s;t edge of the eare at the little cro&s;&s;e, as it is in the figure N^o. 2. F A or F M, or al&s;o F O, what marking &s;oever you de&s;ire to follow &s;et that widene&s;&s;e taken as often along&s;t that fore&s;aid line as you can, and each of the&s;e lengths you &s;hall divide in 10000 parts, this table in this place &s;hewes how many of the&s;e parts you &s;hall appoint for a degree, or a fourth part of a degree, beginning, as is the figure a fore&s;ayd N^o. 2. from the point C. The fir&s;t Columne of the table &s;heweth the degrees, the &s;econd the min. the third the parts, which you mu&s;t take for the degrees, and mi. for the fir&s;t halfe degree or 30 min. 87, for a degrees, 175. for 2 degr. 15 mi. 393, but for 6. degrees, 45. min. 1184. parts; but if you cannot divide &s;o &s;mall a breadth as of F E, or F O, into 10000 parts, then you may divide it into halfe &s;o many parts, and &s;o you &s;hall take &s;o many parts for a degree, or part of a degree, if you cannot doe that, you &s;hall devide it into 1000 parts, at every time, leaving out one letter in the table, as when you &s;hould take for the fir&s;t degree 175. take 17, and as neare, as you can one halfe, for the 8, degrees in the place of 1405, take 140, and &s;o forward.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, draw two parrallel lines, on the lea&s;t roundell &s;tanding on the outermo&s;t end of the &s;taffe, which may be perfectly &s;eene, whereof the one mu&s;t goe through the mid&s;t of the eyhole as O P, the other &s;o much higher that the breadth of the eare at the little roundell Q R if you make a good breadth betweene the&s;e two lines of like widene&s;&s;e. it will be &s;o much the more &s;erviceable for u&s;e; this cro&s;&s;e &s;taf being thus compleately made. The u&s;e of it to take the height is this: you &s;hall &s;et it with the back toward the Sunne (as you &s;ee in this figure here beneath) and looke through the &s;ight of the moveable runpeece, then &s;hall you likewi&s;e &s;ee the Horizon through the ey|hole of the lea&s;t unmoveable peece, and keepe that as &s;traight as you can, but if you u&s;e a cro&s;&s;e as in the figure N^o. 1. is marked with S. then you &s;hal hold the lower edge VX. right on the Horizon, as you doe in the common
<FIGURE>

Then yon &s;hall &s;lide with your hand the long cro&s;&s;e to and fro upon the &s;taffe, untill the &s;hadow of the eare at the uppermo&s;t little cro&s;&s;e fall into the open field, on the lea&s;t unmoveable thin peece on the end of the &s;taffe, ju&s;t between the two parrallel lines above the &s;ight hole, to wit in &s;uch manner; that you may at once&s;ee the
<PB REF="17"> Horizon through both the &s;ight holes, and the &s;haddow of the above-&s;aid eare even above the two fore&s;ayd par|rallel lines that being once obtained, the great cro&s;&s;e will &s;tand ju&s;t by the degree of the true height of the Sunne, to wit, according to &s;uch marking as the uppermo&s;t little cro&s;&s;e (being high or low) is &s;et.</P>
<P>Having found the height of the Sunne, if the declina|nation be northerly, you &s;hall &s;ub&s;tract it from the height found, that is to &s;ay, if you are in the north&s;ide of the Sunne, that is if the Sunne be &s;outherly, but if the decli|nation be &s;outherly, then you adde it to the height found, and &s;o you &s;hall finde the height of the Equinoctiall, which being taken from 90, you &s;hall finde the height of the Pole, as by example: Let the Sunne, as in the figure here by &s;tanding, bee elevated above the Horizon B D 70, de|grees, the northerly declination E D 10 degrees; If you

<P>But if you marke this &s;taffe with the number inverted, &s;o that in the place of 90 you &s;et 0 for 80. 10 for 70 20. and &s;o forth, as the common cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe is marked ordi|narily, which you u&s;e toward the Sunne, you mu&s;t then on the contrary u&s;e the northerly declination, and &s;ub|&s;tract the &s;outherly and &s;o at the fir&s;t without further marking, you have the height as it is in the figure, if as in that which went before you to the height of the Sun being elevated at D 70 gr. you &s;hall in place 70 finde on the &s;taffe 20 that is not the height of the Sun from the Horizon B D, but the fulfilling of the height to 90 degrees as D Z, that is the di&s;tance of the Sun and Zenith, if then you joine to it the northerly declination D E 10 gr. that makes together EZ 30 degrees, the di&s;tance of the Equi|noctiall and Zenith, and ju&s;t at P A the elevation of the Pole. In the &s;ame manner if the Sun hath &s;outherly de|clination, and is ri&s;en from the Horizon 50. gr. as in S. you &s;hall not find on the &s;taffe 50 gr. for B S, but 40. gr. for S Z the di&s;tance of the Sunne and the Zenith. Then if you take S E the &s;outherly declination from S Z 40. there remains E Z 30 degrees, for the di&s;tance of the Equi|noctiall and the Zenith ju&s;t at P A the height of the Pole.</P>
<P>That the un&s;liding peece &s;hould be moveable by the &s;ight it is done for 2. cau&s;es; fir&s;t that you may &s;lide it ne|therward or outward as the&s;e and &s;liding of the great cro&s;&s;e requireth, &s;econdly, that in &s;oule weather when the waves goe high, you may &s;et it inward (as occa&s;ion &s;hall require) for your better mea&s;uring, for where the waves are high and trouble&s;om long in&s;truments, are not &s;o fit for u&s;e as &s;hort. This fore&s;aid cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe is very fit, to take the height certainely on the firm land, without the u&s;e of the Horizon. That you may do this, you &s;hall lay the &s;taffe on a table or any other flat place in a rightline with the water the eye end directly to the &s;outh, and with the other end, where the thwart &s;liding peece &s;tandeth to the north, on two &s;mooth peeces of wood, &s;o much lifted up that you may &s;lide the long cro&s;&s;e too and againe with|out hinderance, then when the Sunne comes directly &s;outh, (that is, when the Sunne hath equall &s;hadow on each &s;ide of the &s;taffe, then &s;hall you &s;lide the long cro&s;&s;e too and fro, &s;o long untill the &s;hadow of the eare at the lit|tle cro&s;&s;e fall ju&s;t betweene the two parrallell lines on the thwart cro&s;&s;e; that being done, you &s;hall finde the height of the Sun in the &s;taffe at the long cro&s;&s;e, which being &s;ound, you &s;hall by that know the height of the Pole or the di&s;tance of the place where you take the height ac|cording to the in&s;tructions before laid downe.</P>

<P>THe A&s;trolabiums which men now a dayes common|ly u&s;e at Sea, I meane that with a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">optra, upon which &s;tand two penullen, &amp; are not verry &s;erviceable by rea&s;on of the continuall motions of the ships to bee u&s;ed at &s;ea unle&s;&s;e the penullen upon the Dioptra are placed neere by one another, for then the Shipmai&s;ters &s;ome times u&s;e the A&s;trolabium in the mea&s;uring of the Sonne. Neverthele&s;&s;e the A&s;trolabium can have no &s;uch perfe|ction in it, for the Dioptra in the &s;aid A&s;trolabiums are placed almo&s;t 2 or 3 inches at mo&s;t the one from the other, and if &s;o bee, in a little time, a &s;mall fault or mi&s;take happen in the ob&s;ervation of the &s;haddows even as through motion of the shipp it may ea&s;ily happen, &s;oo al&s;o mu&s;t the Dioptra upon the degrees of the Limbus make a greater mi&s;take and fault.</P>
<P>Therefore have I here &s;et downe this figured and drawne Ring which you may let be made ready or prepared by Me&s;&s;ig about one foote or a foote &amp; halfe wide and 2 or 3 inches broad. For in the u&s;e of it you have no neede of a Dioptra but you let the Sonne &s;hine through the little holes becau&s;e the &s;haddow may the more perfectly and narrowly bee ob&s;erved, &s;o! then let the ring b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> covered on both &s;ides onely that there may bee &s;ome opening left that &s;o the degrees which &s;tand marked on the in&s;ide may bee fitly &s;eene and u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e degrees fall once more wider one from the other then in the Limbus of the A&s;trolabium, becau&s;e in this the &s;hadow falleth out of the circumference; or out of the &s;ides and not (as it is in the A&s;trolabium) out of the Center, and therefore is the whole circumference of the Ring ac|cording to the Art of Geometry devided into 180 de|grees, whereas on the contrary in the A&s;trolabium the Limbus or round ring encompa&s;&s;ing it containeth 360 de|grees.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The beginning of the degrees beginneth by the letter O, right even again&s;t the little hole over that which is placed next by the handel: there are 2 little holes or chinkes made in the Ring through which you let the &s;had|dow fall, the one &s;tands by the letter B, placed about 10 degr. from the pendel E, by which the ring is hung. The other little hole C. &s;tands ju&s;t 30 degrees di&s;tant from the little hole. B. Becau&s;e: when the Sunne is not verry high above the Hori&s;on, then we receive the &s;haddow through the little hole C, and then wee begin to count the degrees not farre from the letter O, as before&s;aid, but from the letter F, &s;tanding right ju&s;t over again&s;t C. ju&s;t 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> degrees di&s;tant from O.</P>
<P>This ring being thus made I &s;hould thinke it mo&s;t fitting to &s;ignify the hight of the Sunne, notwith&s;tan|ding the Shipmai&s;ters now adayes u&s;e the degree-bow, which neverthele&s;&s;e are great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;ubject to faults and mi&s;takes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 28. <HI>Point.</HI> Of the height of Lands and Countries, and what it is.</HEAD>
<P>THe height and breadth of Lands and Countreyes although that in them&s;elves they are divers things, yet they are allwayes one like unto the other. Any Coun|trey being &s;cituated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lyeth al&s;o in the height 30 degrees, which by Sea-faring men is taken without difference, but what it is, or what it hath in it or &s;ignifieth few men under&s;tand, and yet it behooveth a &s;eafaring man, that &s;eeketh for the height of any Coun|tries, to bee expert therein, for that no man without it can wel under&s;tand how many in&s;truments (whether it be A&s;trolabium, or Cro&s;&s;e &s;taffe, no nor the Sea-compa&s;&s;e it &s;elfe) &s;hould well be u&s;ed: for that the&s;e things are all built upon one foundation, and like a chaine hang one up|on the other. But it may be that &s;ome man will object and &s;ay, that there are many Pilots which doe not well under|&s;tand &s;uch things and yet are able to goe directly unto divers places, whether they de&s;ire to &s;ayle: which I con|fe&s;&s;e to be true: but tell me how many times are they de|ceived? How many times are they in great doubt &amp; feare? and how &s;eldome dare they tru&s;t unto the height which they have taken or reckoned, when they are to &s;eeke out any Countrey thereby? how oftentimes hath it heretofore happened, that for want of &s;uch knowledge, &s;hippes have &s;ayled out of their way either, behinde England, or upon France, which thought to pa&s;&s;e through the chanell be|tween England and France, and that in &s;o &s;hort and well knowne, and common &s;ayled water, as to come out of Spaine or France? what would &s;uch men doe, if they &s;hould pa&s;&s;e the Line, and were to &s;eeke or finde out cer|taine Ilands? Or that after they had &s;ayled up and downe the Seas certaine moneths together, &s;hould then &s;eeke out for Land? but I am of this opinion which I know eve|ry man will grant that it is much better and more a&s;&s;ured to goe away being guided by his owne eye-&s;ight, then like a blinde man to bee led by another, and knoweth not whether that other &s;eeth well or not: but to come againe to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no other but the height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to &s;ay, &s;o many degrees as the Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizon; &s;o much is the height of &s;uch a Country: &amp; this height agreeth allwayes with the breadth as afore&s;ayd. In the 10 Chapter it is &s;hewed, that where|&s;oever a man goeth or turneth, alwayes the one halfe of the Heavens &s;heweth it &s;elfe above the Horizon and the other halfe is hidden from us: in the fir&s;t chapter it is &s;aid
<PB REF="19"> that the two Poles &s;tand right one again&s;t the other, whereby it is evidently to be under&s;tood, that when&s;oever a man being upon the earth is right under the Equinoctiall line, that then both the Poles of the World, lye right in the Horizon, one in the &s;outh, and the other in the north: and as much as a man travaileth northward from the Equinoctiall line; and winneth breadth northerly, &s;o much the north Pole ri&s;eth above the Horizon: and the &s;outh Pole contrarywi&s;e goeth &s;o much under: and on the con|trary, as many degrees as a man goeth from the Equino|ctiall line &s;outhward, and winneth breadth &s;outhward, &s;o much the &s;outh Pole ri&s;eth above the Horizon, and the north Pole goeth &s;o much under: which may ea&s;ily be un|der&s;tood by the figure here after following.</P>
<P>In this figure the innermo&s;t roundel that turneth about, &s;ignifieth the Heaven, N the north Pole, S the &s;outh Pole, AE the Equinoctiall, the uppermo&s;t edge of the halfe moveable roundell, &s;ignifieth the Horizon, the one halfe off the Heavens is above it, and the other halfe ju&s;t under it, the round ball in the middle &s;ignifieth the earth, where in you &s;ee a little man, that may be turned upon the earth &s;outhward and northward.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Now perfectly to marke and perceive that which is before written, that is to know what height is, and that it alwayes agreeth with the breadth, bring the little man upon the Earth Globe right under the Equinoctiall, that is to &s;ay that it have no breadth, neither northward nor &s;outhward, then you &s;hall &s;ee that both the Poles lye ju&s;t with the Horizon, and that neither of them both are ele|vated above it, nor depre&s;&s;ed under it, and withall, you &s;hall &s;ee that they that dwell under the Equinoctiall have no height or elevation of the Pole, nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man &s;o much northward that hee goeth tenne degrees upon the earth, that is, that hee commeth tenne degrees upon the north breadth, you &s;hall &s;ee that the north Pole &s;hall bee ray&s;ed or elevated tenne degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the &s;outh Pole &s;hall goe ten degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the earth more northerly, as thirty, forty, or fifty degrees, the north Pole will al&s;o be &s;o much elevated, and the &s;outh Pole to the contrary &s;o much de|pre&s;&s;ed under the Horizon: &s;o that if you turne the man upon the earth to ninety degrees, then the north Pole al&s;o will bee elevated ninety degrees, that is the Pole will &s;tand right above his head, and the Equinoctiall will joyne with the Horizon in one circle: that which thus is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">id of the elevating of the north Pole, is al&s;o in the &s;ame manner to be under&s;tood of the &s;outh Pole: for if you likewi&s;e move the man upon the earth in the figure toward the &s;outh, the &s;outh Pole will be elevated above the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goeth &s;outhward, and the north P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">le will goe &s;o much under the Horizon.</P>
<P>One thing is herein to be noted, that as much as the Pole ri&s;eth above the Horizon ju&s;t &s;o much the Equino|ctiall goeth under it, and when the Pole goeth under, the Equinoctiall ri&s;eth againe in equall proportion.</P>
<P>But above all you mu&s;t marke, that the number of the Poles elevation added to the height of the Equinoctiall al|wayes make even ninety degrees, &s;o that when the Pole is elevated 30 degrees in the north, the Equinoctiall is ele|vated &s;ixty degrees in the &s;outh: but if the &s;outh Pole bee elevated above your Horizon twenty degrees, the Equinoctiall will bee elevated in the north &s;eventy de|grees, which is clearly under&s;tood and &s;hewed in this manner: we alwayes &s;ee halfe the Heavens above the Ho|rizon, (as afore&s;aid) which is twice ninety degrees, from the &s;outh to the Zenith or the point ju&s;t over our heads, and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Zenith to the Horizon in the north. Now &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> betweene the Equinoctiall and the Pole there are alwayes ninety degrees, (as is &s;hewed in the &s;econd chapter) it followeth that which is beneath the Pole and the Equinoctiall, maketh al&s;o ninety degrees: therefore when we know the height of the Equinoctiall, and take it out of ninety, that which re&s;teth over is alwayes the
<PB REF="19"> height of the pole, this al&s;o may bee &s;eene in the figure afore&s;aid.</P>

<P>THe&s;e Tables of the Suns declination are reckoned upon the Meridian or length of the earth from the we&s;tend of England. Tho&s;e which are more ea&s;terly from thence, have the le&s;&s;er declination, when the Sun depart|eth from the Line, and increa&s;eth in declination either towards the North or South as wel betweene the 20 of March, and the 22 of Iune, as betweene the 23 of Sep|tember, and the 22 of December, and the greater declina|tion, when the Sun returneth againe towards the Line, whether it bee by north or by &s;outh the Line as wel be|tweene the 22 of December, and the 20 of March, as be|tweene the 22 of Iune, and the 23 of December.</P>

That commeth to pa&s;&s;e by rea&s;on of time, thus. Tho&s;e which are more ea&s;terly have the Sunne &s;ooner in the &s;outh or in their Meridian, and therefore is the waxing de|clination le&s;&s;e, and the falling greater, on the contrary tho&s;e which are more we&s;terly have the Sonne later in the South, and therefore have they the increa&s;ing decli|nation more, the decrea&s;ing le&s;&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 33. <HI>Point.</HI> Of the CARD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is knowne to every man, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that der&s;tand the grounds of Co&s;mographie, that the
<PB REF="25"> earth with the waters make one compleate round body, &amp; therefore it cannot be, that you &s;hould &s;et forth the &s;ame perfectly in a plane or Carde (either in the hole or in part) but there will bee &s;ome want, for it is unpo&s;&s;ible to make a plaine agree with a round forme in all the parts thereof. So that your common cardes many times fayle in truth, e&s;peciall tho&s;e that comprehend great and long voyages by &s;ea, and far from the Equinoctiall; but the Maps which are commonly u&s;ed in this Countrey, of the Ea&s;terly and We&s;terly Navigation, are without fault, or at lea&s;t the er|rors are &s;o little that they hinder not.</P>
<P>They are very fit in&s;truments to bee u&s;ed at &s;ea, and our forefathers, which have invented them, have brought no &s;mall profit and utility to Mariners. The fault of them con&s;i&s;ts in this, and thus it may bee &s;eene: If you would &s;ayle a triangle, the 2 fir&s;t &s;ides will bee &s;ayled on their &s;trokes and di&s;tances; but from the 2 to the 3 place (that is the 3 &s;ide of the triangle) it will fayle both on the &s;trokes and di&s;tances.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;ayle from the Lizard a &s;traight cour&s;e to the Ilands of Canary, and from thence againe to the Ilands of Corvo and Flores, on which fore&s;ayd &s;troks and di&s;tances many Maps are very complete and perfect. But if I would &s;ayle againe from Corvo to the Lizard, from whence I fir&s;t &s;ailed, the Card will &s;hew mee an imperfect way, to wit, it will &s;eeme farther wide in the Card, then indeed it is, al&s;o it will differ on the points of the Compa&s;&s;e: &s;o that you mu&s;t direct your cour&s;e more northerly then that which your Card directeth.</P>
<P>In &s;oo &s;hort a journey, as this above &s;aid, it is not much ob&s;erved, neither is it worth the ob&s;ervation: but tho&s;e that &s;ail to the We&s;t-Indies, &s;hall &s;oone perceive it; when they &s;et &s;ayle, they take their cour&s;e far to the &s;outh, and there they finde their Cards of a fit length, becau&s;e the Cards are fitted to it; But in their returne, when they take their cour&s;e northward, they finde the way much &s;horter then their Cardes &s;hew them.</P>
<P>This is the cau&s;e: All the lines in the Card from north and &s;outh are drawne every where at an equall di&s;tance each from other, from the Equinoctiall to the Pole; but on a globe which is made round like the earth, they are not of an equall di&s;tance, but the more northerly they come, &s;o much the nearer they come each to other. So that two &s;trokes from north to &s;outh at the latitude of 60 degrees, are but halfe &s;o wide from one another, as they are at the Equinoctiall, and at the Pole they touch each other. Therefore two &s;hipps being under the Equinoctiall di&s;tant from one another two hundred leagues, they may both &s;ayle directly north without hinderance, comming to the height of 60 gr. but being 100 leagues from each other, and that following the &s;ame cour&s;e, they would in the end meet each other under the pole, but if you direct &s;uch two &s;hips by a plaine Carde, they will bee alway at equall di&s;tance, by which it &s;ufficiently appeares, that all places lying far north, are much too wide, unle&s;&s;e they bee drawne in, which cannot bee done, but you mu&s;t make other places more faulty.</P>

<P>IT is knowne to all experienced Mariners that the eb|bing and flowing of the &s;ea is governed by the Moone, &s;oo that every new and full Moone the waters are higher which they call &s;pring-tydes, and at the quarter of the Moon the waters are lowe&s;t: &s;o that you may know and that certainly by former ob&s;ervation, (although the true and reall cau&s;e thereof is yet hidden from us) the houre of the tyde, and on what point or &s;troke the Moone ma|keth high water in any particular place, to the great pro|fit and furtherance of navigation.</P>
<P>To know on what &s;troke the Moone is, it may be done in a two-fold manner, by the &s;ight, or by marking how old the Moone is; to looke at &s;ome &s;troke of the Compa&s;&s;e, it may not be done according to the common Compa&s;&s;e lying flatte or driving water Compa&s;&s;e, becau&s;e the Ho|rizon divideth only into equall &s;trokes, and &s;heweth in what virticall Circle or Azimuth the Sunne or Moone &s;tandeth, but by a compa&s;&s;e that (being lifted up) accord|ing to the Superficiall part of the Equinoctiall, devideth the Equinoctiall in equall parts, as the common flatt two driving doth the Horizon; &s;uch an Equinoctiall compa&s;&s;e is made in this manner as you &s;ee in this figure: where the roundell A B C &s;heweth the flatt of the Equinoctiall, the gnomen E D the axeltree of the world. The fore|&s;aid rondel in B marked on both &s;ides, in the in&s;ide with the Compa&s;&s;e, and on the edge of the out&s;ide with twice
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> 24 houres and in the ea&s;t and we&s;t at L and M hanging on two pinnes as it were on an axeltree, &s;o that the&s;e being turned up and downe, and the gnomen &s;et and the nether end by D and by the Quadrant F D G, that you may place him at the height of any pole.</P>
<P>If you &s;et &s;uch a compa&s;&s;e with the bottom water compa&s;&s;e, the line H K ju&s;t north and &s;outh, to wit, H to the north and K to the &s;outh, and the lower end of the gnomen by &s;uch a degree of the Quadrant F C, accord|ing to the height of the Pole where you are: there will the roundell A B C, &s;tand even with the &s;urface of the true Equinoctiall, and the gnomen E D with the axeltree of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;ight on &s;uch a Compa&s;&s;e, and a common one, differeth very much, and by how much nearer the Equi|noctiall &s;oo much more will the difference bee, as will ap|peare by this example following.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fir&s;t Example.</HEAD>
<P>On the height of 50 gr. or thereabout, the Sunne being in the beginning of Cancer in the greate&s;t norther|ly declination, it is on a common Compa&s;&s;e ea&s;t at halfe an houre pa&s;t &s;even, and we&s;t at halfe an houre pa&s;t foure, that is: he goeth from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t through the &s;outh in nine houres, but from the we&s;t through the north to the ea&s;t in 15 houres.</P>

<P>At the height of 30 degrees, hee comes little before halfe an houre pa&s;t nine at the ea&s;t, and a little after halfe an houre pa&s;t two to the we&s;t, and &s;o it goeth in le&s;&s;e then five houres and a halfe from the ea&s;t through the &s;outh in|to the we&s;t, but from the we&s;t through the north to the ea&s;t he goeth more then 18 houres.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third Example.</HEAD>
<P>The Dragon&s;head being in the beginning of Aries, and the Moone in the beginning of Cancer, they make 5 gr. more declination than the Sunne, and go to the fore&s;aid height of 30 gr, more then an houre &s;ooner from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, then the Sunne, to wit, about the &s;pace of 4 houres, and againe from the we&s;t to the ea&s;t about the &s;pace of 2 houres.</P>
<P>Under the line, the Sunne having noo declination, ri&s;eth in the morning in the ea&s;t, and ri&s;ing remaineth ea&s;t un|till he commeth to the Zenith and pa&s;&s;eth that to the

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 37. <HI>Point.</HI> How to finde the age of the Moone.</HEAD>
<P>TO doe this without an Almanack, you mu&s;t know the Epact or Key of the yeare, and that you &s;hall finde by the Golden number, and the Golden number thus: looke how many years there are pa&s;t from the yeare of our Lord, 1500, and the&s;e divide by 19 and what re|mains is the Golden number of that yeare, if there re|maine nothing, the golden number is 19.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I de&s;ire to know the Golden number of the yeare 1645, &s;etting the 1500 a &s;ide, I devide the 145 yeares by 19, I find &s;even times, and the remainder is 12. Then the Gol|den number of the yeare 1645. is 12.</P>
<P>The Golden number increa&s;eth every yeare with the beginning of the yeare with one, as in the yeare 1640, it is 7, 1641 it is 8. and &s;o forth to 19, after that againe 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The Epact changeth every yeare on the fir&s;t of March increa&s;ing with 11 to 30, but being more then 30, you mu&s;t leave that 30 and the remainder is the Epact. You &s;hall finde it by the golden number thus: tell the golden number on the 3 joynts of your thumme, beginning with one at the lower joynts, unto the golden number of your yeare propo&s;ed, if it doth end this kind of telling at the lower joynt, then the Epact and the golden number are all one: but if it end on the &s;econd joynt, adde 10, if on the third joynt, adde 20 by the &s;ame golden number, that number is the Epact of that yeare.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I de&s;ire to know the Epact of the yeare 1645, the Gol|den number is 12, telling on the joynts of the thumme be|ginning with one at the lower joynt, the telling endeth with 12 on the highe&s;t joynt, adding 20 to 12, you &s;hall have 32 &s;ub&s;tract 30 there remaines 2 for the Epact of that yeare.</P>
<P>After the old &s;tile, the Golden number is the &s;elfe &s;ame with the new &s;tile, but the Epact is 10 more, there|fore if you adde 10 to the Epact of the new &s;tile, you &s;hall have the Epact of the old &s;tile, as for the yeare 1645, 10, to 12, (the Epact of the new &s;tile) comes 22, this is the Epact of that yeare according to the old &s;tile.</P>
<P>But to find the Epact without telling, is the golden num|ber to know both according to the old and new &s;tile, look on this table following, where they are &s;et the one by the other.</P>

To the &s;outhwards of Blavoort, &amp; the Iron Hendrick, about a league to the &s;outhwards of the mouth of the Eyder, goeth yet a Deep in called the North pipe, where men may &s;aile in, and come out againe by the Hound upon the Eyder. In this Eyder lye on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Deepe &s;even black buyes, which you mu&s;t leave all (in &s;ayling in) on the &s;tar|board &s;ide, and on the north &s;hoare, which you mu&s;t leave on the larboard &s;ide.

When you fall with the land with that cour&s;e you &s;hall e&s;pye to the northwards of the Eyder, upon the land of Eyder&s;tee, a &s;harpe &s;teeple indifferent high, called Gardingen, bring that over or to the &s;outh &s;ide of the little &s;and-hils lying on the north &s;ide of the Eyder, called the Souther-Heads, they &s;hall then &s;tand from you northea&s;t and by north, or a little more ea&s;terly, &s;ayle right in with them &s;o, &amp; you &s;hall fall with outer|mo&s;t buy, when that then the &s;harpe &s;teeple of We&s;lin|buren, &s;tanding to the &s;outhwards of the Eyder in the land of Ditmar&s;en commeth to be ea&s;t or a little more &s;outherly from you, then you have the length of the fore|&s;ayd buye, &amp; then S.

From the fourth to the fifth, that is, the buye upon the Hound, the cour&s;e is ea&s;t, which lyeth thwart of the Hound, on a point which lieth off from Hecke&s;and, which in comming in, men might at unawares &s;ayle within along&s;t to the &s;outh|wards of the buye, therefore you mu&s;t leave that al&s;o (as well as the former) on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, and &s;ayle along&s;t to the northwards of it. Betwixt this fore|&s;ayd buye upon the Hound and the fourth, lyeth another buye upon the north &s;ide of the deep, upon the &s;outher|mo&s;t poynt of the New-grounds, which you mu&s;t leave on the larboard &s;ide, &amp; runne about to the &s;outhwards of it. From the buye upon the Hound to the &s;ixth, the cour&s;e is northnorthea&s;t, and two fathom deep. From the &s;ixth to the &s;eventh and la&s;t buye northea&s;t and by north, and the deepe along&s;t to the northwards of it three fathom.

From the Hulck to Schulperzile, the cour&s;e is ea&s;t &s;outhea&s;t. In that reach, the beakons &s;tand on the &s;outh &s;ide upon the Balla&s;t-plate, and you mu&s;t run along&s;t to the northwards by them, leaving them on the larboard &s;ide. From Schulperzile to Tonningen the cour&s;e is northnorthea&s;t. Before Tonningen the Eyder is at the &s;hoale&s;t, and at low water no deeper then one fathom and a halfe. From thence further in towards the New|town called Frederick &s;tadt, there is depth enough.</P>
<P>The depths here before mentioned are all to bee un|der&s;tood at low water. From Tonningen towards Woller&s;um, the Eyder lyeth along&s;t northea&s;t and by ea&s;t.

Betwixt the&s;e two beakons goeth in through a deepe &s;outhea&s;t or &s;outh|ea&s;t and by ea&s;t, where you may &s;ayle through along&s;t by the beakons upon the Iron Hendrick (which you mu&s;t leave then on the &s;tarboard &s;ide) untill you come into the end of the North-pipe, which lyeth from thence about we&s;t into &s;ea. You may &s;ound in at the North-pipe, comming in out of the &s;ea by the &s;outh &s;hoare in 3 &amp; 4 fathom, untill you come to the fore&s;ayd beakons, &amp; then about by them northwe&s;t, or &s;omewhat more we&s;terly up unto the Eyder, or el&s;e you may runne further along&s;t by the fore&s;ayd &s;outh &s;hoare, untill you come about the beakon upon Hoedmeer&s;and, and then forth betwixt the I&s;land Bulheads and Buy&s;en along&s;t by the Beakons upon Hoedmeer&s;and, with many poynts and bights on to the &s;outhwards, and come out at la&s;t upon the Old Elve, about northea&s;t from the New-work again&s;t the New-grounds, which is not well to bee &s;ayled, but of tho&s;e that are there very well acquainted.</P>

Coninxhaven that is the &s;outhermo&s;t or we&s;termo&s;t channell of the Long&s;ound, &amp; goeth in betwixt the we&s;termo&s;t through poynt and Conings I&s;land, and then men run along&s;t to the ea&s;twards of the Baers, which lyeth off from the fore|&s;ayd rough poynt.

Being pa&s;t that, you &s;hall come againe in a very narrow &s;ound, which lyeth through mo&s;t northea&s;t, and is at &s;ome places &s;o narrow, that the yard armes doe almo&s;t touch the rockes. Being through that narrow place, you mu&s;t goe northea&s;t and by ea&s;t, and ea&s;tnorthea&s;t, untill you come thwart of the Long&s;ound, then you may &s;ayle in there northnorthwe&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road Be|hinde Iof|ferland.</NOTE> or &s;ayle into the &s;ea as you wil: Behinde Jofferland you may al&s;o anchor in fifteen or twenty fathom.</P>

<P>When the Drommels are northwe&s;t and northwe&s;t and by north from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of Maerdow</NOTE> then you are right thwart of Maerdow.

Comming by the land, run along&s;t by it, but come not too neere it, that you loo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;pyre of the &s;teeple of Margat behind the land, for then you &s;hould come too neere it; but if you keepe &s;o far from the &s;hoare, that you can &s;ee the fore&s;ayd &s;teeple above the high land, or keep it even in your &s;ight, then you cannot take hurt of the &s;outh grounds. Comming thwart of Margat, then you are pa&s;t the fore&s;aid &s;hoals or &s;outh grounds. Run then bold|ly towards the &s;hoare, and within two cables lengths along&s;t by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which lye farre to the &s;outhwards towards the land. Sayle on &s;o we&s;t all along&s;t by the &s;hoare, untill that the Reculvers (which are two &s;teeples upon one Church) come one in the other, and then you &s;hall run in &s;ight of the fir&s;t buye upon the La&s;ts, which lieth upon the fore&s;aid markes of the Reculvers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reculvers</NOTE> being by it you can al&s;o &s;ee the other buy which lyeth like as the fir&s;t al&s;o on the north &s;ide, and over again&s;t it on the &s;outh &s;ide &s;tandeth a beakon, there you mu&s;t &s;aile through betwixt them both, leaving the buye on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, and the beakon over again&s;t it on the larboard &s;ide. From thence you may with little &s;hippes, or &s;hippes of little draught, but not with &s;hips of great draught, at high water run over the Swallow on we&s;tnorthwe&s;t towards Sheppy, for it is there &s;hoale water, with &s;hips of great draught you mu&s;t runne through the Fi&s;hers deep towards Black-tayle. You may al&s;o runne from Margat with &s;mall &s;hippes along&s;t by the &s;hoare upon the lead at high water even unto the Sheppy, but in &s;ayling, along&s;t there you mu&s;t ca&s;t your tides well, for the flood falleth very &s;trong into the Swallow, and the ebbe to the con|trary very &s;trong out.</P>

<P>To &s;ayle with &s;hippes of great draughts along&s;t by the north Forland up into the Thames, you mu&s;t (when you are pa&s;t the buyes upon the La&s;t) &s;ayle through the Fi&s;hers deep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;hers-deep.</NOTE> toward Black-tayle, which lyeth from the &s;econd buye upon the La&s;ts, unto the fir&s;t buye in the Fi&s;hers deep, northwe&s;t and northwe&s;t and by we&s;t, which lyeth upon the north &s;ide of the &s;and, which men doe call the Spanjard, tho&s;e two buyes lye a great wayes one from the other.</P>
<P>Sayling from the buye upon the La&s;ts it is a great wayes all &s;hoale water, &s;o that you mu&s;t runne over there with high water, but comming neare the buye upon the Spanjard, it is by little and little deeper water.

In this bay, a great league from Kilduyn lyeth a high I&s;land called Blie&s;na Olinie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blie&s;na Olinie.</NOTE> which is the next or the neare&s;t Olinie, behinde it, un|der the mayne land, neare&s;t the &s;outh end of the I&s;land is a good road, where three or foure &s;hips may lye very well.</P>
<P>The lyeth a round hill, or high Hommock upon the maine land, which &s;heweth out above all the other hom|mockes&punc;, and is very ea&s;y to be knowne, upon which &s;tandeth a high cro&s;&s;e of two cro&s;&s;es one above the other, to the northwards off it lyeth a flat poynt, thwart of it lye &s;ome rocks along&s;t the &s;hoare, which at high water are covered.</P>
<P>At the &s;outh end of the I&s;land Olinie, a little from land, lyeth a rock almo&s;t even with the water, but you may alwayes &s;ee it well by the breaking of the water.</P>
<P>To the Northwards of the I&s;land about an Engli&s;h myle, lyeth a rock not farre from land, and al&s;o to &s;ea|wards from it a &s;uncken rocke, which you cannot goe over at low water.</P>
<P>Hee that will (comming from the northwards) goe to anchor behinde Olinie, mu&s;t runne a good wayes to the ea&s;twards of this fore&s;ayd rocke along&s;t to the northwards of the I&s;land, for to avoid the fore&s;aid rocke. Being come behinde the I&s;land, you &s;hall e&s;py the fore|&s;ayd round hommock with the cro&s;&s;e, you mu&s;t not runne pa&s;t the cro&s;&s;e, but leave it on the larboard &s;ide, and &s;ayle inclo&s;e by it for to avoyd the fore&s;ayd rockes, which lye off from the flat north poynt, the poynt with the cro&s;&s;e is very cleane and &s;o &s;teepe, that you might lye with a &s;hip on again&s;t the &s;hoare without any hurt.</P>
<P>He that will come into this Road from the &s;outhwards, let him run along&s;t by the coa&s;te, which is very cleane, untill pa&s;t the fore&s;ayd poynt with the cro&s;&s;e, and edge up clo&s;e about by it, as is before&s;ayd.</P>
<P>Men doe anchor within the poynt in &s;even, &s;ixe, five, foure and three fathom, deepe or &s;hoale as they will, there goeth no grown &s;ea at all.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt the I&s;land Olinie and Tiri|biry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiribiry.</NOTE> is another haven or great Bay, where men may lye landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>Tiribiry is a great River and off-water, where is a great Salmon fi&s;hing, there men may goe in with great &s;hip|pes, and anchor every where within it where they will in good &s;andy-ground, it lyeth in mo&s;t &s;outh, and after|wards more we&s;terly, the ea&s;termo&s;t poynt lyeth out more to &s;eawards than the other, &s;o that it maketh a bay, where men ride under for a northwe&s;t winde.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the &s;outhwards of Tiribiry lyeth Waronia, which is a great &s;and-bay or haven, with at the mouth is narrow, but within it is a broad Sound, there is al&s;o an off-water, where is al&s;o much Salmon caught.</P>
<P>Within this bay it is every where good anchoring, &s;hoale water and cleane ground.</P>
<P>Before the mouth of this haven lye three little I&s;lands, behinde them is al&s;o good road.</P>
<P>Two leagues or two leagues &amp; a halfe to the &s;outh|wards of Waronia lyeth a Gabriele,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gabriele.</NOTE> a tyde haven, which falleth dry within, &s;o that men may goe over there dry at low water, it floweth there twelve foot up and downe, a &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t moone maketh high water on this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mouth of this haven lye three I&s;lands, two on the north &s;ide (which are the lowe&s;t) and one on the &s;outh &s;ide, that is the highe&s;t, you mu&s;t runne neere&s;t the &s;outhermo&s;t when as you will &s;ayle in there: being come within the I&s;lands, you mu&s;t edge up to the north|wards behinde the two northermo&s;t I&s;lands, and anchor there on the north &s;ide of the haven, there it is &s;even and eight fathom deepe cleane ground.</P>
<P>About a league to the &s;outhwards of it lyeth Salen&s;i Daelna,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Silen&s;i.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, the farther Silen&s;i; but betwixt them both a little to the northwards of Silen&s;i, lyeth yet a great indraught which lyeth in at lea&s;t two leagues into the land, and is about &s;o wyde as the River Tye before
<PB N="72" REF="105"> Am&s;terdam, there may lye a great multitude of &s;hippes, it is there broade and large enough, and all over good anchor ground.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of this in-draught lieth a little I&s;land, or rock, &s;omewhat high, about which you may &s;ayle within, to witt, through betwixt the&s;e rockes and the land, but may make no road under them.</P>
<P>Salen&s;i Daelna<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Silen&s;i.</NOTE> is a great broad bay, before it lye three I&s;lands, which are to &s;ee to gray of colour, as the mayne land.</P>
<P>To the northwards of the&s;e I&s;lands upon the poynt off the bay &s;tandeth 3 great Warders, and a little to the &s;outhwards of the I&s;lands, on the mayne land lyeth a &s;teepe hill, by which markes this bay is very ea&s;y to be knowne.</P>
<P>If you will &s;ayle into this bay comming from the north|wards along&s;t the &s;hoare by the fore&s;ayd great in-draught, a little to the northwards of this baye, you mu&s;t looke out for the&s;e fore&s;ayd great Warders, leave them on the &s;tarbord &s;ide, &amp; &s;ayle in clo&s;e by them, through betwixt that poynt and the I&s;lands, fir&s;t we&s;t&s;outhwe&s;t, &s;omewhat within, and then more &s;outherly, untill behind the I&s;lands, and anchor there in five, &s;ix, or &s;even fathom: you may al&s;o &s;ayle further to the &s;outhwards into the baye, &s;o deepe as you will, there it is all over cleane.</P>
<P>When you come before the channell, it &s;eemeth to bee very narrow, but it is broad enough.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhwards of the&s;e I&s;lands is al&s;o a channell which is very narrow, but yet for need you may &s;ayle out there. The &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;land, that is, whereupon the Fi&s;hermen dwel, is fa&s;t to the northermo&s;t with a &s;hoale, whereupon is at high water 10 or 11 foot water, but at low water you cannot goe over it.</P>
<P>Two little leagues to the &s;outhwards of Salen&s;i lyeth the I&s;land Daelna Olinie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Olinie.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, the Furthe&s;t Olinie, it is an I&s;land almo&s;t of Fa&s;hion like Blie&s;na Olinie, at the north end high, at the &s;outh end lower, and upon the end very &s;teepe, it hath in the midde&s;t, (but &s;ome what neerer the &s;outh end then the north end) a low valley, where at high water the &s;ea doth almo&s;t run along&s;t over it.</P>
<P>Behinde this I&s;land, not under the I&s;land, but under the mayne land, are good roades.</P>
<P>For to come in from the northwards behind this I&s;land, it is a broad, large, and very deepe Channell, without any dangers, but if you will &s;ayle in behinde it (from the &s;outhwards) then you mu&s;t runne in clo&s;e by the I&s;land, for to avoyde a foule and &s;tony riffe, which lyeth off from the maine land, halfe wayes to the I&s;land, and &s;o &s;hoale that it falleth dry with the &s;pring tydes at low water.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes the I&s;land, neare&s;t the &s;outh end, is a point, lying out from the mayne land, twoards the I&s;land, to the northwards of it men doe anchor in 6, 7, or 8 fathom.</P>
<P>When you come in from the northwards, you may (&s;o &s;oone as you come within the points) lu&s;&s;e up towards clo&s;e about the point of the main land into a bay, &amp; anchor there in eight, &s;ix, five or foure fathom, according as you &s;ayle far in, there it is very ea&s;y lying. In the&s;e roades under the mayne land, it is all cleane &amp; flat ri&s;ing ground, but under the I&s;land it is deepe, and the ground ri&s;ing very &s;teep, &amp; therefore it is not good ancho|ring there.</P>
<P>Betwixt this I&s;land Daelna Olinie, &amp; Silen&s;i, lye 3 little black I&s;lands, where is very ea&s;y road under them in 8, 7, and 6, fathom.</P>
<P>From Daelna Olinie to Rinde<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rinde.</NOTE> are five leagues. Rinde is a very faire Haven, before it lye foure little I&s;lands, where men may goe to anchor behinde them, behinde the&s;e I&s;lands this Haven hath two bayes, upon the point betwixt them both &s;tandeth a great Cro&s;&s;e, the &s;outher|mo&s;t baye is farre the greate&s;t, into it commeth al&s;o a river or off water, where men doe catch Salmon. The middlemo&s;t I&s;land (which is the northermo&s;t &s;ave one) is the greate&s;t and highe&s;t upon which &s;tandeth a great Warder, the northermo&s;t is &s;omewhat long and &s;mall, &amp; &s;o low, that at high water the &s;ea runneth up a good wayes upon it on both &s;ides, and &s;o maketh that I&s;land &s;maller.</P>
<P>Betwixt that I&s;land and the maine land, or the north &s;hoare of the Havens mouth lyeth a &s;uncken rock, which you mu&s;t leave, in comming in, on the larboard &s;ide, and runne in clo&s;e by the main land, this channel is &s;o narrow, that you cannot &s;ayle in it, except you have a large wind, at low water there remaineth no more then 9 or 13 foot water.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhwards of that great I&s;land, lyeth another I&s;land that is indifferent high, and the &s;outhermo&s;t of them all, betwixt that and the point of the maine land, lyeth in the &s;outher channell, which is broad and deep enough, but when you &s;eyle in there, you mu&s;t run neare&s;t the land, for to avoid a &s;uncken rock which lyeth at the fore&s;aid poynt of the maine land.</P>
<P>The&s;e channells both from the &s;outhwards and from the northwards lye in both along&s;t the &s;hoares, when as that you come then within the I&s;lands you may anchor there all over where you will, there it is broad and large, and every where cleane &amp; cleare. Men doe anchor com|monly under the greate&s;t I&s;land thwart of the great Warder, and al&s;o behinde the norhermo&s;t I&s;land in five, foure or three fathom there it is very ea&s;y lying but with a &s;outhea&s;t winde, the &s;ea commeth a little rowling in, but there can goe no great &s;ea.</P>
<P>Farre within the &s;outhermo&s;t bay, almo&s;t before the river, lyeth a rock, but above water. Without the greate&s;t and the &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;land, lyeth a little I&s;land, or great rock, &s;omewhat round, you may &s;ayle out and in betwixt the &s;outhermo&s;t and the greate&s;t I&s;land, along&s;t to the n. wards of that little round I&s;land, that is you mu&s;t leave the &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;land with the outermo&s;t little round I&s;land both on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, and the greate&s;t I&s;land with the Warder on the larboard &s;ide, when you &s;ayle out, this is a very narrow channell, but very cleane and cleare, &s;o that there is nothing to bee avoyded, but onely a little &s;uncken rock, which lyeth at the north end of the outermo&s;t little round I&s;land, and falleth dry at low water, neverthele&s;&s;e it is not good to u&s;e it, except it were for need that you could not doe better.</P>
<P>He that is bound into this haven, mu&s;t run clo&s;e along&s;t by the &s;hoare for to get &s;ight of the fore&s;ayd I&s;lands, for by rea&s;on that the inner land is high, the I&s;lands lye &s;o under the land, that men can hardly &s;ee them, when they bee any thing farr off from the &s;hoare.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the &s;outhwards of Rinde is another great Bay, or haven, before it lye two little high I&s;lands upon the northermo&s;t &s;tandeth a great cro&s;&s;e, you may &s;ayle in there about on both &s;ides off the&s;e little I&s;lands, and al&s;o through betwixt them, and anchor where you will in fifteene, twelve, eight, or five fathom, deep or &s;hoale, according as you &s;aile farre in lye &amp; there &s;heltred for all windes, but when the winde is hard out of the &s;ea, thwart upon the &s;hoare, there will come in &s;omewhat a rowling &s;ea, but there can goe no great &s;ea that can hurt you. A little to the northwards of this haven lyeth a low long I&s;land clo&s;e to the &s;hoare, whereby you may al&s;o know this coa&s;t, you may &s;ayle through betwixt this fore&s;ayd I&s;land &amp; the maine land without any danger.</P>
<P>From this haven to the Seven I&s;lands are foure great leagues. A little to the northwards of the end of the &s;even I&s;lands, lyeth a faire great &s;and-bay, where is al&s;o good anchoring for &s;outherly and &s;outhea&s;t windes, but not for ea&s;terly winds, with a northea&s;t or &s;ea wind, it is bad lying there for there is no &s;helter for them, men doe anchor there in twenty, fifteene or twelve fathom, according as they lye far or neare to the &s;hoare.

The fifth is a little round I&s;land, and lyeth nearer to the land, there you cannot runne through within it, which is fa&s;t to the land with a &s;hoale of rocks, whereof &s;ome lye above, and &s;ome under water. The two &s;outhermo&s;t lye a good wayes to the &s;outhwards of the fifth: betwixt them &amp; the mayne land you may al&s;e &s;ayle through, you may al&s;o runne through in &amp; out betwixt the&s;e &s;ame I&s;lands every where, except betwixt the &s;econd and third off from the northwards betwixt them both it is fowle.</P>

<P>Betwixt the northermo&s;t and the mayne land is a good road (thwart of the &s;outh end of the I&s;land) under the maine land, there is a faire &s;and-bay, with an off-water, where is much Salmon to be caught, but it is not there u&s;ed.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of this Sand-bay lyeth a little I&s;land betwixt the great I&s;land and the coa&s;t, men doe anchor to the &s;outhwards of that little I&s;land, thwart of the &s;and-bay in &s;even, &s;ix, five, or foure fathom, &s;o &s;hoale as they will, there is a very even &s;and-ground, ri&s;ing &s;o even as if it were planed.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the fore&s;ayd bay men may make road under the &s;outh poynt of the I&s;land, thwart of a little bay, there they bring a haw&s;er on land, and an anchor to &s;ea|wards in nine-tenne fathom, there they lye &s;ome|what more out off the tyde then in the bay over again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Betwixt this great I&s;land and the coa&s;t is about two third parts of the channell towards the mayne land, flat ri&s;ing ground, and the other third part towards the I&s;land Deep; the neerer the I&s;land the deeper unto 18 and 19 fathom.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt that fore&s;ayd little round I&s;land, and the north poynt of the grate&s;t I&s;land, &s;tand on the mayne land &s;ome little Lappi&s;h hou&s;es, or a little village.</P>

<P>The &s;econd pa&s;&s;e lyeth in through betwixt the three northermo&s;t, and the two &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;lands, that is broad, wide and deepe, and al&s;o the be&s;t channell off all, it lyeth &s;outhwe&s;t, and &s;outhwe&s;t and by we&s;t from the poynt of Swetenoes, and lyeth in mo&s;t &s;outh, when you &s;aile in there, you mu&s;t runne neare&s;t the &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;land, becau&s;e of a &s;uncken rock which lyeth in this channell &s;omewhat off from the third I&s;land, at high wa|ter you may run over it, but not at low water.</P>

<P>For need, or if it were in extremity, you might al&s;o &s;ayle through at high water betwixt the northermo&s;t I&s;land, and the &s;econd, and likewi&s;e al&s;o betwixt the &s;e|cond and the third, but if you can by any means doe bet|ter, it is not good to doe it.</P>

<P>Men may anchor at divers places within the&s;e I&s;lands. Betwixt the two &s;outhermo&s;t I&s;lands, and the innermo&s;t I&s;land, you may have roade, where you may lye &s;heltred for all winds, and &s;afe from Ice-drifts out of the &s;ea. With|in the innermo&s;t I&s;land you mu&s;t al&s;o anchor over again&s;t it &s;omewhat further in again&s;t the &s;teepe poynt. At the rivers mouth, on the we&s;t &s;hoare is a bay where you may &s;ayle in, and anchor &s;o neare to the &s;hoare as you will, in &s;ix, five, foure and three fathom &s;oft &s;ticking ground, there you lye &s;afe from Ice-drifts. You may al&s;o anchor on the ea&s;t &s;ide, right before the &s;teepe poynt, but there you lye not &s;afe for ice that commeth out of the river. The tyde here along&s;t the&s;e I&s;lands, agreeth neere with the tyde of Swetenoes, it floweth with Spring tydes neare two fathom and a halfe up and downe.</P>
<P>Behind the poynt of Swetenoes you may run into the bay, and anchor there for a north, northea&s;t and ea&s;t winde, there is cleane ground.</P>
<P>From Swetenoes to Lomba&s;cho,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lomba|&s;cho.</NOTE> the coa&s;t lyeth &s;outh|&s;outhea&s;t thirteene leagues. Under Lomba&s;cho men may al&s;o goe to anchor, but it is not there very good lying, e&s;pecially with great &s;hippes; the ground there is not cleane, and when the wind is out of the Sea, commeth in there rowling very much. The lying of this road &s;tandeth drawne out at large in the Card, with the depths &s;et downe as it is at high water and neepe tydes: the water falleth and floweth there at lea&s;t two fathom up and downe, &amp; at Spring-tydes little le&s;&s;e then three fathom, or two fa|thom and an halfe.</P>
<P>Within the poynt, or in the bight of Lomba&s;cho you may not anchor, there remaineth not above three foot water, and the ground is &s;tony and foule.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Lomba&s;cho lye five I&s;lands lying along&s;t the coa&s;t allmo&s;t halfe wayes to Swetenoes.</P>

<P>From the poynt of Orlogenes lyeth off a &s;tone-riffe a &s;hot off a ca&s;t peece into Sea, which falleth dry a great wayes at low water, whereof men mu&s;t take very good heed.</P>
<P>From Orlogenes to the river Ponnoye, it is &s;ix leagues: betwixt them lye the three I&s;lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three I&s;lands.</NOTE> Fir&s;t from Orlogenes to the two fir&s;t I&s;lands, the cour&s;e is &s;outh three leagues, &amp; from thence to Ponnoye &s;outhwe&s;t &amp; by &s;outh 3 leag.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the northwards off Ponnoye lyeth the third of the three I&s;lands, &s;o that the two and the third lye about two leagues a&s;under.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are much lower then the maine land, &s;o that they can hardly be &s;eene or not at all, except you be by the &s;hoare, thwart of them you may come neere the &s;hoare in &s;even fathom without danger.</P>
<P>Thwart of the&s;e three I&s;lands, and Ponnoy, the mouth off the white &s;ea is at the narrowe&s;t.</P>
<P>About foure leagues thwart off to &s;eawards from the three I&s;lands in the midde&s;t of the mouth lyeth a &s;hoale, which is very uneven and &s;tony, and at &s;ome places with low water commeth dry above water, it lyeth &s;outh and north, fir&s;t north along&s;t the coa&s;t, at la&s;t north and by we&s;t untill thwart of Lomba&s;cho, but there along&s;t it is deepe enough, fifteen and &s;ixteen fathom. About &s;outh|ea&s;t from Ponnoy it is at the &s;hoale&s;t &s;even fathom deep. You may al&s;o &s;aile along&s;t to the ea&s;twards of this &s;hoale into the white Sea, but there it is &s;hoale water, uneven &amp; very &s;hoale. The right fareway is along&s;t to the we&s;twards of it, and five and twenty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Ponnoy is a River where at low water remaineth no more then ten foot water, it floweth there with a &s;pring-tyde three fathom up and downe, and with an ordinary tyde 15 foot.</P>
<P>From the three I&s;lands to the I&s;land Sou&s;nowits, which men doe call the cro&s;&s;e I&s;land, the cour&s;e is &s;outhwe&s;t &amp; by &s;outh, or as &s;ome doe hold &s;outhwe&s;t ten leagues, or from Ponnoy nine leagues. All along&s;t this coa&s;t men may anchor every where in eight or nine fathom, and with contrary winds &s;top the tydes, there goe &s;trong tydes e&s;pecially in the &s;pring of the yeare withan Ebb.</P>
<P>Between the three I&s;lands and the cro&s;&s;e I&s;land lyeth a poynt, upon which &s;tand al&s;o three cro&s;&s;es, one by the other, which men doe mi&s;take oftentimes for the cro&s;&s;e I&s;land, but it is much &s;maller to &s;ee to. When you doe get &s;ight of that poynt, there &s;heweth by it, as if there lay a &s;hippe before the land with the topma&s;t-&s;tricke. The right cro&s;&s;e I&s;land hath upon the north end two Cro&s;&s;es, and upon the South end three, by all the&s;e markes they are ea&s;y to bee knowne one from the other.</P>
<P>Behind the Cro&s;&s;e I&s;land you may have road in 6 or 7 fathom, you may &s;ayl in behind it, as well from the north|wards as from the &s;outhwards, it is there cleane and cleare every where, men doe anchor, when as the great cro&s;&s;e doth &s;tand from them e.n.e. there is the right road.</P>
<P>Southea&s;t and by &s;outh from the three I&s;lands, and Ponnoy on the Ru&s;&s;e &s;ide, there goeth in the Me&s;eens golfe, into which commeth a great River, where men may go up to Kilda, and Kolmogro, and al&s;o another, upon which the town Slowoda lyeth.</P>
<P>Southea&s;t from Ponnoy lyeth a little I&s;land in the mouth of the Me&s;eens golf, where you may have road under for we&s;terly and &s;outhwe&s;t winds.</P>
<P>The &s;outh poynt of this golf is a low &s;and-&s;trand, all grown with trees, there you may al&s;o anchor along&s;t by the &s;hoare, but clo&s;e by the land; if you lye &s;omewhat of from the &s;hoare in 9 fathom, there the ground is foule, from thence along&s;t the &s;hoare to the Blew point, it is al faire &s;trand ground.</P>
<P>From the Cro&s;&s;e I&s;land, to the blew or Gray point, the cour&s;e is &s;outhwe&s;t twenty leagues. In this fareway in the mouth of the White-&s;ea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Current in the mouth of the white &s;ea.</NOTE> there goe &s;ometimes very &s;trong currents, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring, through the terrible great fre&s;huts, of the melting of the &s;now, which falleth from both &s;ides into the White-&s;ea, and runneth through this &s;trait into the &s;ea, with graet whirling &amp; ter|rible riplings: It happeneth &s;ometimes that the current runneth there &s;o terrible &s;trong, to the w. wards into the &s;ea, that with a rea&s;onable gale &amp; full &s;ayls, men can doe no more but &s;tem the tide, where of men mu&s;t be mindfull.</P>
<P>Under the Gray poynt<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gray-poynt.</NOTE> men may anchor on the &s;outh &s;ide in tenne, eight, or &s;even fathom, there it is good lying for ea&s;terly windes, a northea&s;t winde commeth from the poynt the ground is there rea&s;onable good, but not the cleane&s;t.</P>
<P>From the Gray poynt ea&s;twards to the Me&s;eens Golf the coa&s;t is all faire &s;and-&s;trand, with &s;ome bancks of 2 fathom and an halfe, and three fathom along&s;t the &s;hoare, not farre without the land, where &s;ometimes the current falleth over with great riplings.</P>
<P>From the blew poynt to the river of Arch-Angell, the cour&s;e is &s;outh and by we&s;t fourteen leagues. When as you &s;ayle &s;o towards the rivers, you &s;hall then fir&s;t e&s;py the land a good wayes to the we&s;twards of S. Nicholas, it arri&s;eth in a long &s;trake, and then there ri&s;eth more land towards the River, as if it were a round I&s;land, afterwards you &s;hall &s;ee the &s;teeple of S.

<P>The cape of Candenoes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cande|noes.</NOTE> and Orlogenes lye northea&s;t &amp; &s;outhwe&s;t 7 and &s;ixty leagues a&s;under. The point off Candenoes is very ea&s;y to bee knowne, there &s;tand five great cro&s;&s;es upon it for markes. When as you fall with it, you may very well perceive, that the land falleth away, on the one &s;ide to the &s;outhwe&s;t, towards the White &s;ea, and &s;outhea&s;t on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>About thirteen leagues to the ea&s;twards of the cape de Candenoes lyeth an I&s;land, called Mor&s;onowits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mor&s;ono|wits.</NOTE> to the ea&s;twards of it goeth a great Baye into the land, but it is very &s;hoale water, with many &s;hoales and Dwale-grounds.

<P>The corner of the Strait lieth ju&s;t upon &s;ixtie grades be|north the Line, for the Yce &s;tretches him&s;elf according as the wall lieth: and when ye come be&s;outh the Yce, about nine and fiftie grades and five and twentie or thirtie minutes, &s;ometimes &s;omewhat &s;outhly, &s;ometimes &s;omewhat north|ly, &s;o &s;hall the Yce lie north north-we&s;tward from you, alike as the wall the Straitward in lieth, to the hight of three&s;core three grades, and then lieth the wall right north|ward, till over the three&s;core &s;ix grades and thirtie minutes; and then ye come into the narrow of the Strait, which is about thirtie miles broad; till ye come to the hight of one and &s;eventie grades and thirtie minutes: and then ye come in an open roome Sea lying north-we&s;t, running round northward towards the ea&s;t, and from thence &s;outhward again to the above mentioned narrowne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>This Sea runs northward to the hight of &s;eventie and nine grades, where it is clo&s;ed by fa&s;t land; with a great many bayes and rivers mo&s;t part full of Yce, which becau&s;e of the ebbing and falling of waters is driven through the nar|rowne&s;&s;e of the Strait into the north-Sea, and from thence unto the coa&s;ts of Terra Nova,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terra No|va.</NOTE> into the great-bay of S^t^.

<P>The inhabitants of this land on both &s;ides of the Strait, are heathens and wilde men: and therefore are not to be tru&s;ted though they give never &s;o many tokens of friend|&s;hip. What&s;oever they handle or change with you, they lay it on the oares wherewith they row their Canoe, they tru&s;t no bodie, and therefore are not to be tru&s;ted, for as afore&s;aid they lay their wares on their oares and &s;o delivers it to you.

<HEAD>THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION which Containeth the de&s;cription of IOHN MAYENS ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_IOhn Mayens I&s;land lieth from Hitland north-ward, according to the common Hollands Compas; or as others &s;ay north northwe&s;t upon the half &s;troke: yet it is better to &s;ail &s;omewhat we&s;tlier as to fall a little ea&s;tly, becau&s;e they mu&s;t be on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the Neering, for if they fall ea&s;terly then they mu&s;t needs &s;ail about the north of the &s;ame, where they have too great calmne&s;&s;e, and &s;ometimes whirlwindes, that fall in a &s;udden from the mountain called the Beeren-berg, or in Engli&s;h called the Bears-mountain.</P>
<P>In the Spring of the year on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of this I&s;land is not &s;o much yce as on the north-&s;ide. For the &s;ea on the north &s;ide, (which is never above ten miles navigable) is in the Spring commonly alwayes frozen.</P>
<P>The winde blowes there commonly out of the South|we&s;t, both harder and oftner as out of any other place.</P>
<P>In the South-bay, a &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t and a north-north|we&s;t moone (according to the common compas) makes a full Sea. The floud flowes there from the &s;outh towards the north, and ebbes contrarily.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t (at the north-end of the afore&s;aid I&s;land) did the Sun ri&s;e in the northea&s;t with the one half of his bodie under and the other half above the Horizon: and the la&s;t day of July was he wholy under.</P>
<P>On the North-end of this I&s;land is a very high moun|tain commonly called the Bears-mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bears-mountain.</NOTE> the which, if ye behold it from the north, &s;eemeth to be cloven, but if ye behold it from the ea&s;t or we&s;t-&s;ide, it &s;eemeth round, falling as it were &s;moothly downward, except at the northea&s;t corner, where it &s;tretcheth it &s;elf outward.</P>
<P>The North-corner is hillie and rough, it &s;eemes &s;ome|what low becau&s;e of the high ground that lyeth about it: from thence the matter of half a mile &s;outhward the coa&s;t is hillie, &s;tay and &s;hallow, &s;o far from the wall as a little canon can carry, is it about 20 fathoms deep: a little more &s;outhward is there a &s;mall foot-&s;trand of &s;tonie ground, &s;o that upon &s;ome places ye could make &s;hift to bring your chaloup or boat, and this &s;tretches it &s;elf the mater of a mile in length &s;outhward.</P>
<P>In or upon this &s;trand there are three Yce-hills<NOTE PLACE="marg">The three Yce-hils.</NOTE> high and &s;tay, tho&s;e are congealed of the &s;nowwater which fals in the &s;ommertime from the top of the mountain, two of them lies near to the North-end of the &s;hore.</P>
<P>From thence further &s;outhward is the wall for the matter of a quarter of a mile, (or &s;carce &s;o much) hilly and &s;tay, as it is at the north-end, and from thence is there another &s;hore about half a mile in length, thereon likewi&s;e can ye bring your boat.</P>
<P>From thence come we to the Southea&s;t-corner of the Beats-mountain, which is likewi&s;e hilly and &s;tay as the afore|&s;aid wall, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to come up on it, at &s;ome places higher other &s;ome lower, oneven, it is commonly 25 or 30 fathoms high from the water, and within goeth it in &s;ome place &s;omewhat &s;tay upward to the Bears-mountain.</P>
<P>At this corner lie &s;ome little rocks &s;eparated from the land, whereon are a great many of &s;everall &s;orts of fowls, ye can row to and about the&s;e rocks with your boat: A little about this corner there lie likewi&s;e &s;uch rocks without the wall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers rocks.</NOTE> between the&s;e rocks there is a commodious ha|ven, with a little Sand-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sand-bay.</NOTE> where ye can ea&s;ily bring up your boat while&s;t ye anker; there ye are freed from the &s;ea, for it is there commonly calm water, although it &s;torms without. Ye cannot perceive that there is a haven there till ye be within the rocks; from the&s;e rocks we&s;tward about a &s;hort mile, is the wall &s;tay and rockie as before, yet not &s;o high, all alongs the coa&s;t is there many &s;harp rocks &s;tanding as it were out of the wall: from the land off, as well by the &s;hore as by the &s;tay wall, the matter of a mu&s;quet-&s;hot, or thereabout ye have water &s;ome &s;ixtie fathoms deep.</P>
<P>When ye have pa&s;&s;ed this &s;tay &s;hore, then ye come to a flat ground of black &s;and, which is about a mile in length, about a little canon-&s;hot from the wall, ye have &s;ix fathoms water with black &s;and on the ground, this &s;trand is com|monly called the great Hout-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Hout-bay.</NOTE> or Wood-bay, becau&s;e there is &s;ometimes found much old broken wood: hereby landwards in lies divers flat hills of black<NOTE PLACE="marg">The black hill.</NOTE> earth and few &s;tones, here is the land at his &s;male&s;t, for being on the top of this hill, and &s;hips &s;ailing on every &s;ide of it, ye could make them hear your voice both at once.</P>
<P>We&s;tward from the end of this great Hout-bay, where the land lieth &s;outh-we&s;t to the &s;outh, is there another rockie wall, alike to the afore&s;aid, &s;o far as a piece of ca|non can carry, further have ye another flat, called the &s;mall Hout-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;mall Hout-bay.</NOTE> with an even shore like to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A quarter of a mile Seawards in, by the South-end of that &s;mall Hout-bay, there lieth a rock, which to look to &s;eemeth to be a ship with top&s;ails up:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rock like a ship vvith top|&s;ails.</NOTE> hereabouts is it flat water.</P>
<P>Southward from this &s;mall Hout-bay, there lie many rocks and hills in the &s;ea, there is likewi&s;e a &s;tay rockie wall; between this wall and the rocks is a pa&s;&s;age that runs in &s;ea &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t on, called the Bears-gat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bears-gat.</NOTE> where within four fathoms ye have &s;tonie-ground. Ships could come in to ly there, but there is no anker-ground.</P>
<P>A mile and a half &s;outhwe&s;t &s;outherly from the afore&s;aid rock that &s;eemeth like to be a &s;hip, there lieth another rock of that &s;ame fashion, yet not &s;o &s;harp above as the other, this lieth but a &s;mall canon-&s;hot from the land: be&s;ides this there are many other little rocks (whereon are abundance of fowls) &s;tanding out in a corner: between this and the Bears-gat is the wall rough and rockie, and &s;ometimes here and there &s;mall foot-&s;trands whereon ye cannot come with your boat: and from thence begins the land to be higher and &s;tonier, for from the afore&s;aid corner Seawards in it is rockie and &s;tonie, and landwards in full of hills and moun|tains; in time of need ye may bring your boat to the foot of the hills: half a mile further there lieth more &s;uch rocks, &s;tayly de&s;cending to the water; alongs the shore, &s;o far from land as a &s;mall piece of canon can carrie, it is com|monly fiftie or &s;ixtie fathoms deep.</P>
<P>The matter of three miles &s;outh and to ea&s;tward, from the &s;outh or we&s;t-corner, there lyeth a &s;tone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stone.</NOTE> which at the undeepe&s;t hath about eleven foot of water, which &s;tone in circuit is about &s;o big as a man can throw a &s;mall-&s;tone.</P>
<P>Lucas Bouwen&s;on from Delfs-Haven hath with calm water broken the ruder of his ship there on; about this &s;tonegoeth commonly a hollow water.</P>
<PB N="78.4" REF="118">
<P>The length of half a mile northea&s;tward from this &s;tone ye have uneven ground, for ca&s;ting your &s;ound-lead one time ye can have but &s;even fathoms, and at the other time ye can &s;ound five and thirtie: from this &s;tone towards the land fal|leth the ground by degrees off to the depth of &s;ix and thir|tie fathoms and deeper, yea &s;o far from the wall as a &s;mall peece of canon can carrie ye have four&s;core fathoms wa|ter, with &s;oft clay-ground: but about the &s;tone the ground is &s;tonie and &s;andie.</P>
<P>Claes Dirck&s;on Seyn from Wijck wrote in the year after our redemption 1616. that about eleven or tvvelve miles &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t from the South-corner of the I&s;land, he found 35 or 36 fathoms, vvith black moulie &s;and, and &s;mall &s;tones.</P>
<P>John Sybrant&s;on Pael-man writes, that &s;outh-ea&s;tward from the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of the I&s;land about two miles he found rockie ground, my neighbour had once 60, and I had but 30 fathoms, &s;o that it is very uneven there.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a mile northwe&s;tward from the South-corner, there &s;tands a rock high above water, with &s;undrie other little rocks by him, which are commonly called the &s;even or five rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;even or five rocks.</NOTE> when ye come from the north ye can ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;e through between them: hard by the land there lieth a Holmken<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holmken.</NOTE> a little above water.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;even or five rocks till near under the wall drieth it up from thirtie to five fathoms.</P>
<P>From the &s;outhwall north northwe&s;t a &s;hort mile the land falleth out with a corner, commonly called the Low-&s;outh-corner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lovv-&s;outh-cor|ner.</NOTE> on the &s;hore is it low, and there lieth the &s;loops that keeps watch.</P>
<P>Between the South-corner and this corner there are &s;e|verall infalls, with a low &s;hore, commodious for boats to come by, in the infalls is it &s;andie ground, &s;ix or &s;even fa|thoms deep.</P>
<P>Between this and the South-corner lye &s;ome &s;mall rocks, &s;ome above and &s;ome under water: from thence about two canon-&s;hot is the land &s;omewhat crooked to an infall, which is commonly called, the Bocht of Guinea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bocht of Guinea.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this afore&s;aid Bocht north-ea&s;t northward about half a mile, come ye into the South-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South-bay.</NOTE> a le&s;&s;er Bocht as the afore&s;aid, there were wont to &s;tand ten tents in this bay, for the handling of fi&s;h oil, but in one year the &s;ea wa&s;ht away three tents, thirteen chaloups, tuns and oily-ve&s;&s;els, per|taining to the chamber of Am&s;terdam, it wa&s;ht away like|wi&s;e mo&s;t of the ground whereon they &s;tood, wherefore tho&s;e from Am&s;terdam did delve a large peece of ground the &s;ommer following, whereon they have &s;et two tents.</P>
<P>Afore this Bay ye have from nine to fifteen and &s;o forth to eighteen fathoms, with black &s;andie-ground, a little further off ye have five and twentie, yea thirtie fathoms, with &s;hort &s;tonie ground; and again &s;o far as a &s;mall piece of canon can reach ye have four&s;core fathoms, and &s;oft ground.</P>
<P>Between the Bocht of Guinea and the South-bay the wall is very &s;tay, &s;tonie, and rockie: when ye ly on fifteen fathoms afore this South-bay, then ye can &s;ee through be|tween the land and the Fowlie-rock, or Vogel-klip.</P>
<P>Some two canon-&s;hot from this Fowlie-rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fovvlie-rock.</NOTE> into the Bocht there lieth a &s;mall rock; and on land there is a Red-hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red-hill.</NOTE> in the afore&s;aid Bocht there lieth a chan|nel, whereon ye may lay four or five chaloups.</P>
<P>The matter of a mile north-ea&s;tward from the South-bay, ye &s;hall finde a little corner, then ye have a gate or entry where ye can row through from the mountains into a Kolk or depth, there ye have &s;o much room as to lay &s;ome twentie chaloups on; and it is very convenient for the waiting on whales: this is called of Sea-men the Hoep|&s;tocks-Bay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hoep|&s;tocks-Bay.</NOTE></P>
<P>A large canon-&s;hot from this Hoep&s;tocks-Bay ye &s;hall finde a corner where there are many &s;mall rocks, (which are called the Rud&s;en<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rud|&s;en.</NOTE>) from thence to the Red-hill the wall is rockie and &s;tonie.</P>

<P>A quarter of a mile from the&s;e Rud&s;en or &s;mall rocks towards the Bocht, there is a flat place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North-Bay.</NOTE> which is called the Wood-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVood-bay.</NOTE> becau&s;e of this flat the land lieth high, this flat is a short quarter of a mile large, between this and the Walrush-gate there lieth a great flat Channel, where|on lie all the tents and kettles of the chambers of Hol|land and Zeeland: this Bocht hath a flat &s;andie-ground, where the ships may lie at anker on fifteen or &s;ixteen fa|thoms water, about a canon-shot from land. In the fore-&s;ommer the ships lie near on land within the Bay on eight or nine fathoms water.</P>
<P>From the Briellish-&s;teepel the land lieth ea&s;tward up, and hath for a mile flat &s;trand, which is very convenient for chaloups to keep watch: the afore&s;aid corner of the Walrush-gate is very high and &s;tay towards the &s;ea; at the end of the afore&s;aid mile, ye finde nothing but rockie &s;tay land without any &s;trand, (and which is worthie to be made mention of) a canon-shot from thence ye have a &s;tone, on the fashion of a &s;teepel.</P>
<P>At the end of this afore&s;aid land a little foreby the &s;tee|ple, there ye finde a little infall, which is called Mary-Mus-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mary-Mus-bay.</NOTE> becau&s;e that Mary Mus from Rotterdam, of happie memorie, was the fir&s;t that ever &s;ent a ship there to boile oil: there is a very commodious anker-ground; for about a canon-shot from land, ye have five, &s;ix, or eight fathoms water: and a far way Seawards in ye have &s;mooth water, likewi&s;e ye have a shore fit for all kinde of commo|dities u&s;eable for boiling of fish.</P>

<P>The Indwellers of the North-cape towards Finmarken &s;ay, that that Bay never free&s;es, &s;o that they get their living mo&s;t by taking of fish and drying the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Bears-I&s;land is rea&s;onable high, ye can row about it in the &s;pace of &s;ix hours; at the north-we&s;t corner thereof coming within three miles to it, ye can finde ground of fourtie fathoms, and how nearer the land ye come how un|deeper it is, for within a canon shot to it ye are on 15 fa|thoms.</P>
<P>Out of the Bears-I&s;land ye can have refreshment of wa|ters although it were for an hundred ships: there groweth likewi&s;e brave herbs, whereof ye can make &s;alate, which re|fresheth a man extraordinarily: there are al&s;o many fowls: ye finde there coals to burn, not unlike to the Scots coals.</P>

<P>At the northea&s;t end of Hoopen-I&s;land there is a valley wel a quarter of a mile in circuit, whereon re&s;orts a great number of Walrushes, yea &s;ometimes it lieth whole full of them: there are likewi&s;e an innumerable number of Sea-mews and other Sea fowls, they flie &s;ometimes in &s;uch mul|titudes, that they hinder you from the &s;ight of the firma|ment above your head; &s;o that the land is wel enough to be known by the off and on flying of tho&s;e fowls &s;eeking food for their young ones.</P>

There are a great many gee&s;e on this I&s;land, which in the &s;ommer time are wholly naked having no kinde of feathers; they lay their egge under their &s;tump or taile, and on that fashion breeds forth their young ones: there are &s;uch multitudes of tho&s;e gee&s;e there, that the Ru&s;&s;es comes with their Lodges or boats to land, and takes of them by multitudes, and &s;alts them in tuns.</P>

<P>_HOw men &s;hall &s;ayle about the riff off Fa&s;terborn hat been here be|fore rehear&s;ed. The coa&s;t from Fa&s;terborn ea&s;twards lyeth mo&s;t ea&s;t and ea&s;t and by north. Fir&s;t from Fa&s;terborn to Elburgh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elburgh.</NOTE> are three leagues. If you will anchor before Elburgh, then bring the Cloy&s;ter and the Church with|in a fathom or a fathom and a half near one to the other, and &s;ayle &s;o right in unto the town, you may anchor by it in 4, 3 or 2 fathom and a halfe.</P>
<P>From Elburgh to Uyt&s;tede are 7 or 8 leagues. Betwixt them both about 3 leagues to the ea&s;twards of Elburgh, and 5 leagues to the we&s;twards of Uyt&s;tee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uyt&s;tee.</NOTE> is a poynt, off from which lyeth a &s;hoale, come no nearer it then 8 or 9 fathom. Uyt&s;tee lyeth in a bight, and hath a high &s;harp &s;teeple. If you be bound thither, then bring the &s;teeple north from you, and then &s;ayle in right with it towards the &s;trand; there &s;tandeth a red tiled hou&s;e to the ea&s;t|wards of the bridge, bring that hou&s;e and the end of the bridge one in the other, and &s;ayle in &s;o, and runne to the we&s;twardes of the bridge, anchor there in 3 fathom, or two foot le&s;&s;e, there is cleane &s;and-ground. When you come from the we&s;t, and are pa&s;t that fore&s;ayd &s;hoale then you may boldly runne along&s;t by the &s;hoare in 3 fa|thom &amp; an half, without feare.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the ea&s;twards of Uyt&s;tee lyeth a high poynt called Goe&s;&s;ebeer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goesbeer.</NOTE> from thence to Sandham|mer is a league.</P>
<P>From the point of Goe&s;&s;ebeer runneth off a great &s;hoale farre to &s;eawards, and lyeth along&s;t the coa&s;t, unto neare Sandhammer, you may &s;ound it in &s;ix, eight, and ten fathom, as you will. When you runne over it in tenne fathom, then lyeth the north-end of Bruntholm about ea&s;t &amp; by &s;outh from you, and the poynt of Sandhammer north. Under the Sand-hammer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sand-ha|mer.</NOTE> is good anchoring for a we&s;t, we&s;t&s;outhwe&s;t, we&s;tnorthwe&s;t, &amp; northwe&s;t winde, in five or &s;ixe fathom. When you come out of the north|ea&s;t, you may runne along by this coa&s;t, with a northwe&s;t winde, in 7, 8, 9, or 12 fathom, unttill pa&s;t Goe&s;beer, for to avoyd Brunt-holm.</P>
<P>The point of Goe&s;beer and the north end of Brunt|holm lye northwe&s;t and by we&s;t and &s;outhea&s;t &amp; by ea&s;t about five leagues a&s;under, but Uyt&s;tee and the fore&s;ayd north end off Bruntholm lyeth we&s;tnorthwe&s;t &amp; ea&s;t|&s;outhea&s;t 9 leagues a&s;&s;under.</P>
<P>For to &s;ayle from Fal&s;terborne about to the north|wards of Bruntholme you mu&s;t go on ea&s;t, &s;o long untill that you have the length of Uyt&s;tee, then forth ea&s;t and by north, and then you &s;hall &s;ayle yet neer enough to the poynt and &s;hoale of Goe&s;beer, come no nearer it then &s;even or eight fathom. But to &s;ayle From Fa&s;terborn to the &s;outhwards of Brontholm, the cour&s;e is ea&s;t and by &s;outh &s;omewhat &s;outherly two and twenty or three &amp; twenty leagues, &amp; along&s;t the &s;outh &s;ide off Brontholme ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t.</P>
<P>The I&s;land Brontholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bront|holm.</NOTE> is clean round about, except on the &s;outhea&s;t poynt, there runneth off a foule riffe, called Brewers rif, which men mu&s;t avoyd. On the northea&s;t &s;ide you may runne along&s;t by it upon your lead, without doing ami&s;&s;e, in 12 or 13 fathom, &amp; along&s;t the &s;outhwe&s;t &s;ide in 8 or 9 fathom.</P>
<P>Men may anchor round about Brontholm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade un|der Bront|holm.</NOTE> at divers places, as before Rottum, &amp; to the northwards, before the Ca&s;tle, thwart of Sandwick, Suaux and Nex.</P>
<P>Before the Village, betwixt Rottum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rottum.</NOTE> &amp; the ca&s;tle that &s;tandeth upon the northwe&s;t poynt, is good anchoring for an ea&s;t or northea&s;t winde, in thirteen, fourteen, and fifiteen fathom, but not verie cleane ground.</P>
<P>Thwart of the Ca&s;tle it is good lying for an ea&s;tnorth|ea&s;t, ea&s;t, &amp; ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t winde in 18 &amp; 20 &amp; al&s;o 14 &amp; 15 fathom, &s;and ground, but nearer the &s;hoare the ground is not varie cleane, the nearer to the &s;hoare the fouler ground.</P>
<P>Under the northwe&s;t poynt before Sandwick<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandwick</NOTE> there is good anchoring for &s;outhwe&s;t windes, and you may come neare unto that poynt. From the northwe&s;t poynt to the other poynt the &s;hoare lyeth ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t and we&s;tnorthwe&s;t.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide is good anchoring before Suaux and Nex: but before Nex it is not verie clean. By Nex<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nex.</NOTE> runneth off a little riffe from the &s;hoare, which is &s;teepe on both &s;ides: but if you come no nearer it then in tenne fathom, you can take no hurt of it: to the northwardes of Nex
<PB N="80" REF="126"> lyeth al&s;o a great rock.

<P>The Eertholmes lye from the north-end off Brunt|holm ea&s;t and by north &amp; we&s;t &amp; by &s;outh three leagues a&s;under, and from the &s;outhea&s;t end &s;outh and north five leagues. In the Eertholms is a little Haven, but by rea&s;on that is not u&s;ed it is unknowne.</P>
<P>Betwixt the north poynt of Bruntholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shoale by Brunt|holm.</NOTE> &amp; the point of Sand-hammer, but neare&s;t to Bruntholm lyeth a &s;hoale of &s;ix fathom, where &s;ometimes Fi&s;hermen doe lye to fi&s;h it is not verie great, but hard &s;tonie ground.</P>
<P>From Sandhammer the coa&s;t lyeth northnorthea&s;t &amp; north &amp; by ea&s;t two leagues to Somer-haven, this is a round bay, within it is very good anchor ground. From thence the coa&s;t lyeth about north 6 leagues unto Ahuys. From the north poynt of Brontholm to Ahuys, the cour&s;e is north &s;omewhat we&s;terly about 13 or 14 leagues. But to Hanno north, and by ea&s;t 13 or 14 leagues.</P>
<P>Ahuys lyeth upon a river, where &s;ometimes is before the towne 10, or 11, and &s;ometimes al&s;o no more then 4 or 5 foot water, according as the water commeth off out of the land, upon it is a great fi&s;hing, where in the &s;ommer time are great &s;tore of good Els taken. To the ea&s;twardes of the mouth of the River runneth off a &s;tony flat from the &s;hoare, and to the &s;outhwards of the river a foule &s;tony riffe, right off from the &s;hoare along&s;t by the fore&s;ayd flat, &s;o that there lyeth in a channell betwixt the fore&s;ayd flat, and riffe, which is called the Ea&s;tergat.</P>
<P>Through this fore&s;aid riffe lyeth in a channell untill into the Ea&s;tergat, on again&s;t the &s;latte, which is called the Southergat. If you will &s;ail into this &s;outhergat, com|ming from the &s;outhwards, then runne to the we&s;t &s;hoare to the &s;outhwards of Ahuys, untill you come in 5 or 6 fathom, and then you &s;hall &s;ee upon the north &s;hoare, north and by we&s;t or &s;omewhat more we&s;terly from you, a cape or beacon &s;tanding a little from the &s;trand within the land, of fa&s;hion like a mill without wings: Bring this beacon to the we&s;t &s;ide of the high Hill, which lyeth &s;omewhat further into the Land, to witt, even in the going off the highe&s;t of the hill, keepe the&s;e markes &s;o &s;tanding, and &s;ail in right with them, untill that Ahuys commeth over that tree, which &s;tandeth there at the north end of the wood; or that the white Countrie-church come to the northwards of the little hou&s;es of Ahuys, then goe on northwe&s;t, or bring that fore&s;ayd white-countrie-church in a little valley, a little to the northwards of an old ruined ca&s;tle, where of there &s;tandeth yet &s;ome of the walls upon the north &s;ide of the River, and &s;ail &s;o on, untill that Ahuys come to &s;tand in the midde&s;t of the River, anchor there in two fathom and an halfe, or three fathom, there is the roade there can goe no &s;ea. In this &s;outhergatt it is two fathom, two fathom and an half, and &s;ometimes al&s;o at lea&s;t 3 fathom deep.</P>
<P>For to &s;ayle into the Ea&s;tergat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ea&s;tergat Ahuys.</NOTE> comming from the &s;outhwards keepe in &s;ixe or &s;even fathom, and runne &s;o to the north &s;hoare, and then you runne along&s;t without the riffe, that lyeth off by &s;outh the rivers mouth from the we&s;t &s;hoare untill that Ahuys doe &s;tand right we&s;t from you, then there commeth a great tree to the wood, that &s;tandeth upon the we&s;t &s;hoare, keepe that &s;o &s;tanding and runne in right with it, untill that fore&s;ayd countrie-church come to that afore&s;aid old peece of wall, of the old ruinous ca&s;tle, and then right in, as hath beene before &s;aid.

<P>Hanno<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hanno.</NOTE> is a high round I&s;land, which men may &s;ayle round about, under it is good road for &s;outh and &s;outh|ea&s;t windes.</P>
<P>Behind Hanno runneth up a little River to Self-brough, but &s;erveth onely for &s;mall &s;hippes or Crayers, which go not deepe.</P>
<P>From Ahuys to the Rockes the cour&s;e is ea&s;t and by &s;outh twelve or thirteene leagues, betwixt them both lye divers little townes, as Fleholme and Rottenbuy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fleholm Rotten|buy.</NOTE> where men may anchor before, in &s;ixe, &s;even, and eight fathom good anchor ground: And other Havens more, but little or nothing knowne by Hollanders. Thwart of Rottenbuye lyeth a little Rocke &s;omwhat off from the land, called Malqueren, under which men may al&s;o ride.</P>
<P>From the north poynt of Bruntholm to the Rocks the cour&s;e is northea&s;t &s;omewhat northerly &s;ixteen leagues, but from the poynt of Sandhammer ea&s;tnorth|ea&s;t &s;ixteen leagues. If you runne along&s;t clo&s;e by the north poynt of Bruntholm, you &s;hall runne with a north waye, along&s;t even without the Rocks: But if you runne along&s;t clo&s;e by the poynt of Sandhammer, and will &s;aile from thence to the Rockes, you &s;hall with a northea&s;t &amp; by ea&s;t waye fall with the Land even within them, or to the We&s;twardes of them.</P>
<P>The Rocks<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rocks</NOTE> are &s;ome little rocks together, which men may &s;ayle round about, but can have no Roade under them; they lye 3 or 4 leagues di&s;tant from the maine land, &amp; are &s;maller then the Eartholms.</P>
<P>A leagues or two to the northwards of them lyeth the Vrouwen of Greene I&s;land, by &s;ome called the Rough-I&s;land, and al&s;o the Outlyers: It is not &s;o brooken in it &s;elfe as the Rocks, and al&s;o much greater, off to &s;eawards from it, lye &s;ome rocks, to the we&s;twards of it, it is all full of rocks, &s;ome above and &s;ome under water along&s;t even fa&s;t to the Land, you may &s;aile about within the Greene-I&s;land betwixt it and the rockes, but no man can doe it, but he mu&s;t be verie well acquainted there, and then al&s;o not without great daunger. To the &s;. wards of it you may al&s;o finde Road at &s;ome places but you mu&s;t be verie wel acquainted, &amp; al&s;o not without daunger, by rea&s;on of the multitude of &s;uncken rocks and &s;harp grounds. The ea&s;t &s;ide of of the Outlyers lye from the rocks northea&s;t and by north. The &s;outh end of Oeland<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oeland.</NOTE> is a &s;harpe point, and lyeth from the rocks ea&s;t &amp; we&s;t about ten leagues di&s;tant. Thwart of it, betwixt the mayne land and the afore&s;ayd &s;outh poynt of Oeland, it is about four lea|gues broad, betwixt them both goeth in the Calmer-&s;ound.</P>
<P>For to &s;ayle up into the Calmer &s;ound, then goe on from the rockes, or from the Outlyers northea&s;t, and by ea&s;t and then you runne in betwixt Oeland &amp; the maine land, upon 14 fathom and &s;ayle then northnorthea&s;t betwixt them both, a midde&s;t the channell, both the &s;hoares are verie foule: but if you come not nearer them then in 7 fathom, you can take no hurt there.</P>
<P>From the Rocks to Calmer are &s;ixteen leagues: About halfe wayes betwixt them, northwe&s;t from Southerorden the &s;outhermo&s;t poynt of Oeland lyeth the towne of Chri&s;tianopell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri&s;tia|nopel.</NOTE> lately built there upon a little I&s;land by the Kings Maje&s;tie of Denmarke, and &s;o called after his name.

<P>At Chri&s;tianopel is a haven on the ea&s;t &s;ide, from it lyeth off a riffe towards the ea&s;tnorthea&s;t into &s;ea; there|fore he that will &s;ayle in there mu&s;t come in from the northwards for to avoyde this riffe.</P>
<P>To the northwardes of Chri&s;tianopel towardes Cal|mer, it is on both &s;ides (as well on the &s;ide of the mayne land, as on the &s;ide of Oeland) all full of rocks and foule grounds, but you may &s;ound both the &s;hoares: in the midde&s;t betwixt both in the farewaye, it is tenne and twelve fathom deep, all &s;oft claye ground, to the &s;outh|wards
<PB N="81" REF="126"> of Chri&s;tianopel it is deeper, but to the north|wards of Calmer it is by little and little &s;hoaler.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northwards of Chri&s;tianopell lyeth Bercker haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bercker-haven.</NOTE> there men doe lade oaken beams, there within it is good lying, but verie bad for to come in or out, becau&s;e of the multitude of &s;unken rocks, and other foule grounds, which lye before it, about a half league off from the &s;hoare to &s;eawards.</P>
<P>About a league to the northwards of Berckerhaven lyeth Ho&s;mes ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;mes ground.</NOTE> which is a very bad foule ground, lying &s;omewhat farther off from the &s;hoare to &s;ea-wards, then the other rocks which lye along&s;t the &s;hoare, the|reof you mu&s;t take heede.</P>
<P>About a league to the &s;outhwards of Calmer, &amp; two leagues to the northwards of Ho&s;mes ground, lyeth a poynt called Steen&s;oe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steen&s;oe.</NOTE> which is a &s;omewhat high rough and very foule poynt, a halfe league long, lying within, a halfe league neare to the towne, to the we&s;twards of it runneth in a great bight, where is good lying al&s;o for manie &s;hipps, but you cannot come in there, becau&s;e of the manie foule grounds and dangers, except it be with a very skilfull Pilot: upon the we&s;t &s;ide, over again&s;t the poynt &s;tandeth a white hou&s;e. The King of Denmarks fleet of &s;hips laye there, in the time of the la&s;t &s;iege of Calmer.</P>
<P>When you come &s;o farre in, that you lee&s;e the &s;outh end of Oeland out of your &s;ight, then you get the Ca&s;tle of Calmer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tle of Calmer.</NOTE> in &s;ight, &s;ayle towards it but &s;hunne the &s;hoa|res, as hath been &s;ayde here before. The Ca&s;tle hath four great towers, when the two ea&s;termo&s;t of the four come one in the other, then is the Ca&s;tle about north|we&s;t from you, then you come by the Grim&s;chaer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grim|&s;chaer</NOTE> this is a rock ea&s;y to be knowne, upon it &s;tandeth a ma&s;t, with a Barrell upon the toppe of it, which lyeth much nearer the we&s;t &s;hoare then Oeland, when you get it in &s;ight, then &s;ayle towards it. Thwart of the Grim&s;chaer or Tonholm lyeth a &s;unken rock, about a cables length off from it, and a little more to the ea&s;twards, upon it is no more then five foot water.</P>
<P>The farewaye is through, betwixt this &s;unken rock &amp; the Grim&s;chaer about northea&s;t and by north, &s;ayle clo&s;e along&s;t by the Grim&s;chaer, leaving it on the larboard &s;ide, and then the fore&s;ayd &s;unken Rock remaineth on the &s;tarboard &s;ide of you.</P>
<P>Being a little pa&s;t the fore&s;ayd &s;unken Rock, &amp; Grim|&s;chaer, you come then on again&s;t the we&s;t end of a long &s;mall rock, which lieth farr to the ea&s;twards, towards Oeland, and lieth almo&s;t even with the water, at &s;ome places a little above water, and at &s;ome places the Sea runneth along&s;t over it, edge then a little up to the north|wards, and runne about by the poynt of that rock; Being pa&s;t that, you &s;hall meet on the larboard &s;ide a low rock, from the which there &s;hooteth off a little taile to the northwards, upon it &s;tandeth a little beacon, &s;ayle along&s;t by it, and being a little pa&s;t it, then &s;hall the town lye we&s;t&s;outhwe&s;t from you, let your anchor fall there in five or &s;ixe fathom, there is the right road. If you come to anchor &s;omewhat northerly in the roade, you mu&s;t be carefull to take heed of a &s;unken rock which lyeth not more then eleven or twelve foot under water.</P>
<P>The Marks of this &s;unken rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunken rock.</NOTE> are the&s;e: When the mills upon the Mulholm are one in the other, with the mill which &s;tandeth on the north &s;ide without the town, then you are thwart off the fore&s;ayd &s;unken rock; On both &s;ides of it, as well to the northwards as the &s;outh|wards of it, it is deep enough. It is good lying there, all|mo&s;t with all windes, but a north and by ea&s;t winde is the wor&s;t, which bloweth there open in. With &s;hipps that go not deeper then &s;ixe or &s;even foote, men may come to lye at the bridge before the towne.</P>
<P>You may al&s;o &s;ayle to the we&s;twards of the Grim|&s;chaer: that is, through betwixt the Grim&s;chaer and the land, with &s;hipps that go not deep, but he that &s;hall doe it, mu&s;t be verie well acquainted there, for there it is all full of Rocks, &s;ome above and &s;ome under water.</P>

A league to the northwards off the Heele there runneth of a flat from the land, where you mu&s;t take heed, when you will go to anchor under the Heele, you may anchor on both &s;ides of the Heele, but on the inner&s;ide it is &s;oft ground.</P>

<P>THe lying of Derwinda, and how men &s;hall know it, is here before declared.</P>
<P>From Derwinda to Ly&s;erorte, the coa&s;t lyeth northea&s;t and by north foure leagues, and from Ly&s;erorte to Dome&s;nes ea&s;tnorthea&s;t twelve or thirteen leagues. When you are thwart of Ly&s;erorte, you can perceive no poynt, it &s;eemeth to be all an even right coa&s;t from Derwinda to Dome&s;nes, but comming from Derwinda or Dome&s;nes, and being a league or two to the ea&s;twards or to the we&s;twards of it, you can &s;ee well that it is a blunt poynt, lying out. Thwart of Ly&s;erorte run|neth off a great uneven &s;hoale, at lea&s;t two leagues in|to &s;ea, but you need not feare of it, you may runne over it in four, five or &s;ix fathom by the lead, like as al&s;o along&s;t all the coa&s;t of Coerland from Derwinda, untill about Dome&s;nes.</P>
<P>To the we&s;twards of Ly&s;erort the land hath a little bight, there you may anchor for northea&s;t, ea&s;tnorth|ea&s;t and ea&s;t winds: when it bloweth hard, &amp; that you can do no good with turning to windwards, you mu&s;t bring the poynt of Ly&s;erorte ea&s;tnorthea&s;t from you in &s;even fathom, there is clean &s;and-ground and good lying.</P>
<P>The land betwixt Dome&s;nes and Derwinda is very ea&s;y to be known. At the poynt of Derwinda it is high, and goeth &s;loping down by little &amp; little to the ea&s;twards unto Ly&s;eroort: Likewi&s;e 3 or 4 leagues by we&s;t Dome&s;|nes lyeth a high blewhill, called the Doembergh, which is &s;teep on the ea&s;t &s;ide, &amp; goeth by little &amp; little &s;loping downe to the we&s;twardes unto neare Ly&s;erorte, &s;o that there two high double blewlands do go down into a val|ley one again&s;t the other, the low land betwixt both is Ly&s;erorte.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ley&s;eror|te.</NOTE> The poynt of Dome&s;nes it &s;elf is low &s;andy land, it lyeth out about 3 leagues to the ea&s;twards of the fore&s;ayd Doembergh: but all that is together full of trees.</P>
<P>The &s;outh end of Oe&s;el<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe off Oe&s;el.</NOTE> lyeth from the poynt of Do|me&s;nes northwe&s;t and by we&s;t about &s;ix leagues a &s;under, there runneth off a great Riffe, about &s;outh and by we&s;t, and &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t into &s;ea, towardes the &s;hoale Ly|&s;erorte, called Swalverorte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swalver|orte.</NOTE> that is a dangerous riffe, at le&s;t three leagues long, verie hard and uneven, at &s;ome places towards Oe&s;ell it lyeth drye above water, and at &s;ome other places it is two, two and an half &amp; three fa|thom deep. To the we&s;twards of that riffe lie al&s;o manie uneven Dwael-grounds a good wayes off from the land, which lye along&s;t the coa&s;t of Oe&s;el to the northwards, which are at &s;ome places not deeper then two, three and four fathom.</P>

<P>If you will goe to Rye, and comming out of the &s;ea doe fall with the land about Derwinda, then leave not the coa&s;t of Coerland, but runne about by it upon the lead, all along unto Dome&s;nes in four, five, &s;ixe or &s;even fa|thom, according as you have the wind, that you may not fall without, or to the we&s;twards of that riffe Swal|verorte. The channell betwixt Coerland and that fore|&s;ayd riffe is fourteen, fifteen and &s;ixteen fathom, but very uneven. The ground upon the &s;hoale thwart of Ly&s;e|rorte is at &s;ome places al&s;o very uneven for to &s;ound, &s;ometimes &s;ixe, &s;ometimes eight and nine fathom, the one ca&s;t at lea&s;t two or three fathom more or le&s;&s;e then the other, and that not very farre from the land but you need not feare of it, you may bouldly runne to the &s;hoare in four and five fathom.</P>
<P>But if (when you come out of the &s;ea) you are pa&s;t Ly&s;erorte, and come with the land to the northwards of it again&s;t Oe&s;ell, then you have deeper water, for not far to the we&s;twards without Swalverorte<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks to &s;hunne Swalver|orte.</NOTE> it is thirty fa|thom deep.

Or when as you have the Doembergh ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t from you, then keepe it &s;o &s;tanding from you, and &s;ayle in &s;o right with it, and then you &s;hall (without hurt) runne along&s;t over the taile of the outermo&s;t &s;hoale of Swalve|rorte, it &s;hoaleth up there very &s;oone and &s;uddainly from 13 or 15 and nine fathom, but if you bringe the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Doembergh not more &s;outherly from you then ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t and &s;outhea&s;t and by ea&s;t then you &s;hall not meet with any dangers of the Dwaelgrounds, nor of Swalverorte, you &s;hall thus &s;ayle along&s;t at lea&s;t three leagues over the Dwaelgrounds and Swalverorte, over very uneven grounds, the one ca&s;t at lea&s;t twelve, the other nine, and al&s;o wel &s;even, and &s;ixe fathom, but goe on your cour&s;e without feare, when as the Inner &s;ide, or ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh end of Oe&s;el commeth to be north, and north and by ea&s;t from you, then you are over the riffe, within all the foule grounds that might hurt you, when as that you get then 13 or 14 fathom, then &s;ayle bouldly without fear towards Dome&s;nes.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould happen, that with a northwe&s;t winde, you &s;hould fall with the land to the northwards of Derwinda or Ly&s;erorte, &amp; &s;hould fear to come neere the Coa&s;t of Coerland, then keepe not further off to Sea, then that the ea&s;t poynt of Doembergh be ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t from you, when as then you bring the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh point of Oe&s;ell northnorthea&s;t from you, then you &s;hall runne along&s;t over Swalverorte in &s;even fathom. Betwixt Oe&s;el and Coerland it is &s;ixteen and &s;eventeen fathom deep. When as Dome&s;nes is &s;outhea&s;t and by ea&s;t, and the &s;outh poynt of Oe&s;el northwe&s;t and by north from you, and that you are a like neare to them both there it is eighteen farhom deep.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Dome&s;nes runneth off al&s;o a riffe northea&s;t and by north, or a little more northerly a lea|gue and half into the &s;ea, which is on the ea&s;t &s;ide very &s;teepe, but on the we&s;t &s;ide &s;omewhat flatter.</P>
<P>When you come from out of the we&s;t, and are bound to Rye you may runne about by it upon your lead, in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 fathom, &s;o neare as you will, but accord|ing as the winde and weather &s;hall be, I know of &s;ome that have &s;ounded about it in foure, and foure fathom &amp; half: but he that will runne &s;o &s;omewhat neare about it mu&s;t be very carefull in u&s;ing of his lead, &amp; not let it re&s;t.</P>
<P>Not very farre from the riffe, on the we&s;t &s;ide, it is 12 and 13 fathom deep. When as the poynt of Dome&s;|nes, where the withered trees &s;tande upon come to bee &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t from you, then you come on again&s;t the we&s;t &s;ide of the riffe, when that poynt is &s;outhwe&s;t and by &s;outh from you, then you are right thwart of the poynt, but when it is &s;outhwe&s;t, and &s;outhwe&s;t and by we&s;t from you, then you are about the riffe, and then you may bouldly goe on &s;outhea&s;t towards Rye. Dome&s;nes and the Deep of Rye lye &s;outhea&s;t &amp; northwe&s;t twenty leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>About eight leagues to the ea&s;twards or to the &s;outh|wards of Dome&s;nes runneth off another riffe from a poynt which you may &s;ound about in five &amp; &s;ix fathom. The land betwixt Dome&s;nes and that poynt lyeth about &s;outh&s;outhea&s;t, and northnorthwe&s;t, but to the &s;outh|wards of it, it falleth away to the &s;outh; &s;o that betwixt this poynt, and the Deep of Rye, there is a great bay, which is called the Kowerwyck:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kower+wy ke.</NOTE> &s;omewhat to the &s;outh|wards of this poynt in the bay, lyeth &s;ome high land, which lyeth from the Deepe of Rye w. and by &s;. and e. and by north. It mu&s;t be very cleare weather when you can &s;ee it, lying at anchor before the deepe of Rye.</P>
<P>When as (comming from Rye) you &s;hall be &s;omewhat to the &s;outhwards in the Koperwike, and come running out there by the &s;hoare, this fore&s;ayd poynt hath thus oftentimes been mi&s;taken for Dome&s;nes, becau&s;e that then you can &s;ee no Land without it, but when as you come about the point, you &s;hall againe &s;ee the Land out a head, then you are yet about 8 leagues from Dome&s;nes.</P>
<P>Under the poynt of Dome&s;nes you may anchor on both &s;ides, as well to the we&s;twards as to the ea&s;twards. If you will anchor to the we&s;twards of it, then anchor in 6, 7 or 8 fathom, there you have good &s;and ground, and &s;heltred for ea&s;t and &s;outhea&s;t winds. If you wil an|chor to the ea&s;twards of it, then anchor in 6 or 7 fathom, a little within the poynt of the land, &s;o that the poynt be north or north and by we&s;t from you, there is good &s;andie ground, &amp; good lying for a &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t we&s;t|northwe&s;t and northnorthwe&s;t winde: the point of the riffe lyeth then from you about northnorthea&s;t a league and half. If you will anchor further from the &s;hoare, &s;o that the poynt of Dome&s;nes be northwe&s;t or northwe&s;t &amp; by north from you, there it is eighteen and twentie fathom deep &amp; &s;oft ground.</P>
<P>If that you are comming off from Rye again&s;t the riff of Dome&s;nes, you will &s;ail about it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un|der Do|&s;nes.</NOTE> then you mu&s;t run|ne farre enough about without it, or if you will take it &s;omewhat near, you mu&s;t be exceeding carefull in u&s;ing your lead. It is (as hath bene &s;ayd) verie &s;teepe on the ea&s;t &s;ide, with a northwe&s;t waye, (which runneth thwart into the riffe) you &s;hall have the one ca&s;t twelve nine, or eight, and the next ca&s;t four, or three fathom, if you fall within the poynt of the riffe. But if you have been at anchor under Dome&s;nes, and &s;et &s;ayle from thence and will &s;ayle about the riffe, then you may the better runne about it by your lead. Goe from thence northnorth|ea&s;t and northea&s;t &amp; by north, that runneth mo&s;t along&s;t by the riffe. When the point off Ne&s;&s;e commeth about we&s;t from you, then it will be by little and little &s;ome|what &s;hoaler, you mu&s;t not &s;pare your lead, but mu&s;t &s;o|und often. With a northwe&s;t cour&s;e come not nearer it then in nine ten or twelve fathom. When the poynt of Nes commeth to be &s;outhwe&s;t from you, you may run about &s;ound it &s;o in five, &s;ixe or 7 fathom, then you come to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the riffe, when that is &s;outh|we&s;t &amp; by &s;outh from you, then you are right thwart of the point of the riffe, but when it is &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t from you, then you are about the riffe, go then we&s;t &s;outhwe&s;t or more &s;outherly towardes Coerland, and runne along&s;t by it, in five, &s;ixe or &s;even fathom (accor|ding as the winde &s;hall be) toward Lu&s;eroort.</P>
<P>If you &s;ayle from Rye with an ea&s;t or northea&s;t winde, &amp; &s;hall &s;aile by night about the rif, then &s;et your cour&s;e &s;o, that you be &s;ure you run farre enough along&s;t to the n. wards, or without the Riffe, &amp; keepe that cour&s;e untill that you come neare the grounds of Ambroock or Oe&s;el in 15 or 16 fathom, then you &s;hall be without doubt pa&s;t the riffe, then goe on a while &s;outhwe&s;t, untill that you reckon the poynt of Dome&s;nes to be &s;outhea&s;t, or &s;ome|what more ea&s;terly from you, then edge up to the coa&s;t of Coerland by your lead, and runne along&s;t by it, in four, five, &s;ixe or &s;even fathom, as hath been before&s;ayd.</P>

The north rocke is a great plate of rocks, whereof many at high water are under water. There goeth al&s;o from it a foule ledge off unto the land, &s;o that a man may hardly &s;ayle through betwixt the rocks and the maine land, except a man be extraordinary well acquainted. But betwixt the north|rock &amp; the &s;outhrock goeth a faire broad Sound through, where men may well turn too and again, and at many places may anchor, it is all over good clean &s;andy ground, 6, or 7, and 8 fathom deep.</P>
<P>From the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outhrocke unto the I&s;lands at the ea&s;t point of the bay of Knockfergus, called Kop|pen, or Kopland I&s;les, the cour&s;e is North northwe&s;t or &s;omewhat more northerly, about &s;ix leagues: for when men &s;ayle from the ea&s;t &s;ide of the&s;e I&s;lands to the &s;outhwards, with a &s;.&s;.e. way, they goe farre enough without the north and Southrocks. There betwixt them both lie divers more little I&s;lands, rocks, and &s;uncken rocks, &amp; &s;hoals, for the which men mu&s;t take good heed when they will come neare by the &s;hoare.</P>
<P>The Kopland I&s;les lye about an Engli&s;h mile from the land, they are upon the off &s;ide to &s;eawards, cleane, but from the inner &s;ide there goeth off &s;ome ledges and foule ground, in the mid-way there going through it is 5 &amp; &s;ix fathom deepe, but it is be&s;t to goe without, except for them that are well acquainted.

<P>The bay of Knockfergus<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of Knock|fergus.</NOTE> is a great broad Sound; About 3 leagues inwards in the Bay w. from Copland I&s;les, is the road before Knockfergus, there is good anchor ground in 3 fathom and a halfe. Somewhat more further out towards the n. point al&s;o on the n. &s;ide of the bay &s;tandeth a Ca&s;tle, called Mou&s;ehils Ca&s;tle, by it is a &s;andy bay, where is good anchorage, as well for great &s;hips as &s;mall, for the n. and the n.w. winds, but a &s;outh|we&s;t winde maketh a bad road in the&s;e places.</P>

There goe &s;ome Creekes through the &s;oule grounds, where men (for need) might &s;ayle through, but it is no wi&s;dome to go about it, when there is no need, and that men can do better. Not very long &s;ince, there came a man (by night unacquainted) there in, and ranne through onely upon the &s;ight of the breaches of the water, and got through without any hurt, but not without great feare and danger. He that commeth off from the faire Forland, mu&s;t (at lea&s;t) goe South ea&s;t and by ea&s;t, &s;or to runne along&s;t cleare of the&s;e foule grounds. From the we&s;t &s;ide al&s;o lieth off a little tayle of a ledge of Rockes towards the land. Further, it is there cleane, that men may &s;ayle through there within, but men mu&s;t not come nearer the Maydes, then about halfe channell betwixt them and the maine, but the maine land &s;o neare as they will, which is both cleane and cleare, with many Bayes, where men may every where anchor, yet here and there lie &s;ome Rocks, but they are all above water: There is nothing that can hurt you, but men may ea&s;ily &s;ee it.</P>

To the ea&s;twards of Saint Nazare lye two other villages, and there betwixt the Villages it is very &s;hoale, and &s;tony ground, there men mu&s;t bor|row over the &s;outher &s;hoare, but when you are halfe wayes to the ea&s;termo&s;t Village then you may well &s;ayle right on with the poynt of the Village, untill you be pa&s;t it, but again&s;t that ea&s;termo&s;t Village on the &s;. &s;ide, upon the poynt, lyeth a banck, called Pynbut<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pynbut.</NOTE> which, lieth at lea&s;t halfe wayes over in the River, but men may run through betwixt the poynt and this bancke in 5 or 6 fathom, this is the road for &s;hippes that are bound out to &s;ea.</P>

<P>When you &s;ayle into the Killiats, as before is &s;ayd, it is 12, 11, and 10 fathom deepe, but being come &s;o farre that the Tower of S.

<P>If you will goe over the banck that lieth off from the Abbey with a &s;hippe that draweth much water, then you mu&s;t &s;tay &s;o long that it be halfe flood, for at low water there remaineth no more upon it then three fa|thom, or a foot or two more: when it is &s;omewhat flowed, then you may well goe over with a great &s;hippe.

<P>The markes for to keepe the deepe&s;t water, when you run over the bank are the&s;e keep the great Tower of Rochel a hand&s;pikes length to the &s;outhward of the wood of trees, which &s;tandeth upon the northermo&s;t high land, and run &s;o over the banck, it is there all &s;oft ground.</P>
<P>If you will anchor before the Abbey within the banke, then run in 6 or 7 fathom and anchor there.</P>
<P>But if you will not anchor under S.

Upon the fore&s;aid Barre is at high water and Spring tyde, at lea&s;t three fathom, with an ordinary tyde two fathom and a halfe, but at low water no more then 3 foot water. When you come about the point, you mu&s;t &s;ayle up to the &s;outh|wards, keeping about the middle of the channell along&s;t the river, or rather neare&s;t the we&s;t &s;ide, for to avoide &s;ome foule ground and &s;hoale, that lie on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and anchor before the town in foure, five, or &s;ixe fathom.

<P>A little within this Barre on the north &s;ide of the river lieth up to the northwards, a great water within, of 7 leagues long, and falleth out into Sea by Cabritton. Along&s;t that great water the &s;hips were wont to &s;ayle up to Bayone, but it is now upon the &s;outh end at the river of Bayone, almo&s;t altogether paled too, &s;o that there can but &s;mall barkes goe through, for to keepe the better the Barre of Bayone deepe with &s;cowring through of the water.</P>

A little within the we&s;t point of the Bay is al&s;o a little Dock, where there is a foot water more then in the fore&s;aid tyde-haven, but it falleth al&s;o dry at low water.</P>
<P>This Bay is very good to know by the&s;e marks that hereafter are written: It lyeth right in the Bight, to the ea&s;twardes of it lyeth the land north and by ea&s;t towards Bayone, and to the we&s;twardes of it the land falleth away &s;outhwe&s;t nnd by we&s;t, and &s;outhwe&s;t towards Fonteravia.

He that will anchor there and is not well acquainted, mu&s;t take in a Pilot, which may bring him to a place where is good anchor ground, for although that it be a great Bay, yet neverthele&s;&s;e there are few places where the ground is clean; but is at many places foule, &s;o that but few &s;hips &s;hould be able to lie there in clean ground, when you lie in the right road, then lieth the e. point of the Bay e. and the w. point about n.w. from you.</P>
<P>About a leag. to the w. wards of Tiro lieth a &s;teep point when you come from the e. wards along&s;t by the &s;hoare, you &s;hall &s;ee no more land without the point, untill that you come near it, when you begin to get it upon your broad &s;ide, then there commeth out to the we&s;twards a great &s;quare cliff, which is very ea&s;y to be known, and is whiti&s;h with reddi&s;h &s;pots, and &s;eemeth a far off as if it were a wall. This point is called after that white poynt, C. Blanco.<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Blanco.</NOTE> About 3 leag. to the w. wards of this C.

From the fore&s;ayd C. Blanco to the C. Cantin, the coa&s;t lyeth we&s;t &s;.w. and &s;.w. and by w. about 9 leag.</P>
<P>The C. Cantin<NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

If you come from the northwards, or from C.

If you fall to the ea&s;twards of the C. the coa&s;t lyeth there &s;.w. and by w. and w. &s;. w. and it is even plaine land. About 10 leag. to the e. wards of the C. lieth that little town Tyro, with a high white tower upon the &s;ea &s;ide, &amp; 5 or 6 leag. more to the we&s;twards (betwixt Ca&s;a Cavalgero and C. Cantin) you &s;hall &s;ee a little bight or Bay, thereabouts lie upon the &s;trand by the water &s;ide, great black rockes, which &s;hew as if they were wrakes of &s;hips, and then forth along&s;t to the C. it is a faire flat &s;andy &s;trand. From the C. &s;hooteth off a ledge of rocks &s;omewhat off into &s;ea, which men mu&s;t avoid when they &s;ayle about the Cape.</P>

<P>To the &s;outhwards of the Bay of Saffia<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffia.</NOTE> is high uneven, and mo&s;t of all double land, but to the &s;outhwards of it, it is even &amp; plain, thereby men may ea&s;ily perceive or di&s;cern whether they be to the northwards of Saffia, or to the &s;outhwards of it.</P>
<P>If you will anchor in the bay<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to an|chor in the Bay.</NOTE> or road before Saffia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffia.</NOTE> then bring the north poynt (whereupon &s;tandeth a to|wer) a little more we&s;terly then n. from you, &amp; anchor then in 18 fathom. Or if you will anchor further in the Bay, then bring the fore&s;ayd north poynt n.n.w. or a little more northerly from you, and then the northermo&s;t of the two north points &s;hall bee a &s;hippes length without the &s;outhermo&s;t or the next unto you run then &s;o farre to the &s;outhwards untill that the tower were men doe land with the boats (which is a high &s;qua|re tower &s;tanding below even within the wal of the tow|ne) come right over a tower which is fa&s;t to the wall, which commeth off from the Ca&s;tle above to the &s;outh|wards, &s;o that the fore&s;aid thicke tower below come right over the Haven, betwixt the poynt where the ca&s;tle &s;tandeth upon the water &s;ide, and the rocks where men goe in betwixt.

<P>About two leagues from Saffia, lyeth the &s;outh point of the bay, which is a low point that lieth out, and two leagues to the &s;outhwards of it lieth another &s;teep rocky point without &s;andy &s;trand. By it goeth in the River Tan&s;it up into the land unto Marrocos.</P>

<P>Again&s;t the northea&s;t end of the I&s;land Mogodor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;land Mogodor</NOTE> there &s;hooteth off from the maine land, a great row off rocks; being hard &s;harpe rockes, whereof the outtermo&s;t or tho&s;e that lye next to the I&s;land Mogodor, lye high above water: He that commeth from the northwards, and will &s;ayle in behind the I&s;land Mogodor, mu&s;t runne in betwixt the I&s;land and the fore&s;ayd rockes, clo&s;e in along&s;t by the Rocks. It is there in comming in, betwixt the I&s;land and the Rockes five fathom deep. Within the fore&s;ayd Rocks lye al&s;o &s;ome other Rockes on the larboard &s;ide, which at high water are under water, and at low water are uncovered. When you come to the end of them, you may luffe up about by them towards the maine land, and anchor there within them in 3 fathom at low water, there is good &s;and-ground. But yet ne|verthele&s;&s;e it is not there very good lying, for by rea&s;on of the breaking of the Sea upon the fore&s;ayd rocks, there goeth &s;ometimes a great Sea, &s;o that it is not good lying there with a &s;torme, but further in, under the I&s;land it is good lying in two fathom and a halfe. From the &s;outh-end of the I&s;land lyeth off a little riffe towards the maine land almo&s;t to the foot &s;trand, and to the &s;. wards off that fore&s;ayd little riffe, lyeth a bancke off from the maine land almo&s;t a league off into &s;ea. If you will &s;ayle out at the &s;outh end, then run along&s;t by the &s;hoare of the maine land, untill that you bee about the fore&s;ayd riffe, and run out then upon your lead along by the banck, &amp; then you &s;hall pre&s;ently get deeper water, of 4, 6, 8, &amp; 10 fat. then you may &s;ayle there, where you de&s;ire to be:</P>

<P>About 8 leagues to the northwards of C. de Geer lyeth a point called C. de Taffalana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. de Taf|falana.</NOTE> under which men may ride in good &s;and-ground for ea&s;t and northea&s;t windes. The C. de Geer is lower then the land to the northwards of it, and falleth to the &s;outhwards flat off into &s;ea, which men &s;hall fir&s;t perceive when they come within 3 or 4 leagues of it.

In the Summer time you may anchor nearer to the &s;hoare, untill you come in &s;ix and &s;even fathom. When you &s;ayle from C. de Geer towards the playe or the Road, you mu&s;t be carefull to keepe clo&s;e aboord of the land of the Cape, and run along&s;t by it, nutill you come before the Ca&s;tle. If you runne farre off from the &s;hoare, you &s;hall with northerly windes (which blow there much) be con&s;trained to come in n. e. &amp; n.n. e. again for to recover the &s;hoare, therefore it is be&s;t to keep clo&s;e aboard the high land.

<HEAD>The &s;econd Demon&s;tration, In Which Are to be &s;eene the Canary I&s;lands.</HEAD>
<P>THe chiefe&s;t I&s;lands of the Canaries are 7 in number, Lancerota, Forteventura, or Porte|ventura, great Canaries, Teneriffe, Gomera, Palma, and Ferro. The I&s;land Lancerota lyeth from Cape S. Vincent &s;outh&s;outhwe&s;t di&s;tant about 165 leagues. It hath one haven upon the northea&s;t end, betwixt the two I&s;lands Alagranca and Gratio&s;a, where men may come in from the northwards &amp; lye landlockt for all winds, it is deep there 10, 15, and 20 fathom, and they may &s;ayle out again to the &s;outhwards along by Lancerota. At the ea&s;t &s;ide of Lancerota is a good road before the Towne of Lancerota, there lyeth a banck to the northwards of it, which men mu&s;t avoyd, and run about to the &s;outhwards of it, there they may anchor in 10, 11, and 12 fathom: on the &s;ame &s;outhea&s;t &s;ide lye al&s;o two bad havens a great &s;hot of a ca&s;t peece one from the other, the northermo&s;t is called Porto de Naos, &amp; the &s;outhermo&s;t Porto de Cavallos, which we have demon&s;trated in a large volume in the northwe&s;t corner of this card, &amp; &s;hewed the depths with number of feet at high water &amp; &s;pring-tide.</P>
<P>Porto de Naos, the deepe&s;t of the&s;e bad-havens, goeth in northwe&s;t and by north betwixt two ledges of rockes, there &s;tand two beacons of heapes of &s;tones, in manner as the warders of Norway, which you mu&s;t bring and keepe one in the other, and &s;ayle &s;o right in through betwixt the two fore&s;ayd ledges of rockes. The &s;hoale&s;t of the Barre betwixt the two ledges of rockes, is but a &s;hort &s;pace, a great &s;hippes length long and is deepe at high watet 17 foot, &amp; at low water &s;even foot, &s;o &s;oone as you &s;hall be over, it will pre&s;ently bee 20, 24, 26, &amp; 28 foot deep, then you mu&s;t edge up n. and then pre&s;ently northea&s;t &amp; anchor behinde the rockes which lye to the northwards of the Barre, in the Channell the ground is rocky, hard, &amp; uneven. If a &s;hip &s;hould come to &s;trike there, it &s;hould pre&s;ently be broken. The ledge is &s;o without as it is within, very &s;teep, &s;oo that you may come very clo&s;e unto it, where the anchors &s;tand marked, it is altogether cleane &s;andy ground, 30 &amp; 34 foot deep at high water with a &s;ea wind there can goe here a great &s;ea, but that happeneth &s;eldome, for the winds; doe blow mo&s;t out of the n. &amp; n.e. and therefore it is almo&s;t alwayes there &s;mooth water. This haven is very narrow betwixt the rockes; which lye to &s;eawards of you &amp; the &s;hoare, it is but a little more then a great cables length broad, and from the havens mouth to the main land about a Cables length &amp; a halfe. The Havens mouth al&s;o is not broad, but at high water the rockes doe flow a good wayes on both &s;ides under water, which at low water againe are uncovered.</P>
<P>Betwixt Porto de Naos and Porto de Cavallos lye two little I&s;lands, the northermo&s;t is the greate&s;t, at high water men may goe through with boats within the I&s;lands, into Porto de Cavallos, but not with &s;hips for at low water it falleth dry there within. Upon the &s;outhermo&s;t little I&s;land &s;tandeth an old Ca&s;tle fallen downe, which heretofore hath beene &s;poyled by Engli&s;hmen. From the &s;outh &s;ide of that little I&s;land &s;hooteth off a riffe, &amp; to the &s;outhwards or the w. wards of it lyeth in the Barre, which is very narrow, not above ten fathom broad, upon the maine land &s;tand al&s;o two little beakons, as at Porto de Naos, which you mu&s;t bring one in the other, and &s;aile &s;o right in. At high water and &s;pring-tide there is no more then twelve foot water, or an halfe foot more, the ground in the havens mouth is al&s;o hard, &amp; nothing el&s;e then rocks, where you mu&s;t goe in over but within it is cleane &s;andy ground where you may lye a ground without any danger, with a &s;hippe that draweth tenne or eleven foot water. At the highe&s;t water the mo&s;t part of the rockes on both &s;ides of the Havens mouth, lye under water, &s;o that at many places men may goe over them with boats. At low water there remaineth in this Havens mouth no more then a foot, or a foot and a halfe depth, &s;o that a &s;hippes boat cannot goe in; within men lye landlockt for all windes, and although it blow very hard, yet the water is alwayes &s;mooth. In both the&s;e havens a &s;outh and by we&s;t and north and by ea&s;t moone maketh high water. Neare the Havens there are no hou&s;es where Spaniards or Moores doe dwell, then only by Porto de Cavallos a little Church, where they have Ma&s;&s;e &s;ayd on Sundayes, when &s;hippes lie there. Men go from thence betwixt the Mountaines to the town, which lieth 3 leag. from thence. He that wil come here mu&s;t provide him&s;elfe with fre&s;h water, for there is very &s;eldom fre&s;h water to be gotten. Upon this land there groweth neither fruit nor wine. In &s;ome good years it giveth out Wheat, Bally, &amp; Or&s;illy, the Inhabitants are Moore under the command of the King of Spaine.</P>
<P>Betwixt Lancerota and Forteventure lyeth a little lI&s;and called I&s;le de Lobos, which is on the outer &s;ide, to wit, on the n. we&s;t &s;ide, very foule. Men may anchor on both &s;ides of that I&s;land in 15 or 20 fathom, al&s;o in &s;ix fathom a &s;hot of a ca&s;t peece &s;outhwe&s;t and by we&s;t from the we&s;t point off the I&s;land, there men may lye land-lockt for all windes, except for a northnorthwe&s;t and &s;outhea&s;t windes. The coa&s;t of Forteventura is at the northea&s;t end very foule, with many riffes that lye out, whereupon the &s;ea doth break exceedingly.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of great Canaries lieth from Forteventura we&s;t 19 or 20 leagues di&s;tant. The road there lyeth, at the ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, behinde the n.e. point, thwart off a Ca&s;tle that &s;tandeth upon a Chindle. The fore&s;aid northea&s;t point, is a very high point, with a long &s;mall and low &s;and&s;trand fa&s;t to the other land, &s;o that when it is five or &s;ixe leagues northwe&s;t or &s;outhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t from you it &s;eemeth to be an I&s;land a&s;under off from the other land. If you de&s;ire to go in there into the road, then &s;aile about by that northea&s;t point, along&s;t by the I&s;olettes, leaving them on the &s;tarboard &s;ide of you untill that the Ca&s;tle do lie near about northwe&s;t and by north from you, anchor there in eight, nine, ten, or twelve fathom, then lieth the north point northea&s;t and by north and the &s;outh poynt &s;outh&s;outhea&s;t from you.</P>
<P>At the &s;outh end of the great Canaries is a faire &s;and-bay called Ma&s;palomba, there is a good road for &s;outherly windes, &amp; fre&s;h water to be gotten.</P>
<P>The north point of the great Canaries, and the north|ea&s;t point of Teneriffe called Punte de Nago, lie we&s;t|northwe&s;t, and ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t di&s;tant 21 leagues. In Teneriffe is a road on the &s;outhea&s;t &s;ide before the town S. Cruz, there is a faire &s;and-bay, a little to the north|wards of the town is the be&s;t road in 20, or 24 fathom, and then Punte de Nago, the northea&s;t point of Teneriffe lieth northnorthea&s;t from you, and the &s;outh point &s;outh and by we&s;t. When the Pico of Teneriffe is we&s;t&s;outhwe&s;t from you, then are you open before this road of S. Cruz, and when you lye in the road of S. Cruz, you may &s;ee the I&s;land of great Canaries &s;outhea&s;t from you about 13 leagues.</P>
<P>On the northwe&s;t &s;ide of Teneriffe lieth the road of Garrichica, from the northea&s;t point Punte de Nago we&s;t&s;outhwe&s;t and &s;outhwe&s;t &amp; by we&s;t eight or nine leagues; He that will anchor before Garrichica, let him anchor to the we&s;twards of the rock with the cro&s;&s;e called the Lion, &s;o that the fore&s;ayd rock do lie &s;outh|ea&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="256"> and by ea&s;t and &s;outhea&s;t from him, then he &s;hall lie right before the towne, and may &s;ee right into the &s;treet of the town, through the Cloi&s;ter of S. Dominicus, there is clean ground in 36 or 40 fathom, the Pieck lieth then over the w. &s;ide off the town, nearer to the land, or to the rock then in 35 or 36 fathom it is not cleane, &amp; we&s;twards towards the riffe Lapania it is al&s;o foule ground. This is a dangerous road, therefore every one that commeth here, mu&s;t be very carefull to have their anchors, cables, and &s;ailes very preedy and ready for to &s;hift roads as &s;oon as it beginneth to be a &s;torme.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a little haven before Garrichica, where men may lie with a few &s;hips. For to &s;ayle in there, you mu&s;t have a Pilot. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the havens mouth lieth a rock under water, but the &s;ea breaketh alwayes upon it, you may anchor within in the haven in five or &s;ix fathom, and mu&s;t bring two anchors out a head to &s;eawards, with a cable on the rocks, and an anchor out a &s;tearn, on the land, &s;o that the &s;hips cannot wend too and again, the ground is there foule, you mu&s;t buye up your cables with buyes and cask for to keep them from the ground. This is a good haven in Summer, then it is com|monly good weather, but in the winter it is not good to com in there with a &s;hip, for the grown &s;ea out of the n. we&s;t commeth running in there &s;ometimes &s;o forcible and &s;trong, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to hold a &s;hip, although &s;he had to anchors out. It hath hapned certain years pa&s;t that there was lo&s;t in the &s;ame haven a great many &s;hips; and a great many hou&s;es of the &s;ame towne wa&s;hed away with the great water.</P>
<P>Betwixt Garrichica and the ea&s;t end of Teneriffe, are three lading places more for to lade wine at, as Maramela Relecho, and Oratama.</P>
<P>At the &s;outhwe&s;t end of Teneriffe lieth al&s;o another little haven or Bay where is much wines laden called Ade&s;&s;a, there is al&s;o good lying except it be with a &s;.w. winde, which bloweth there open in.</P>
<P>From Teneriffe to the I&s;land la Palma, the cour&s;e is we&s;tnorthwe&s;t twenty leagues. On the &s;outhea&s;t &s;ide la Palma, lieth a faire Bay, with a town and lade-place called S. Cruz. He that commeth from the northwards, and de&s;ireth to anchor in the road, let him run &s;o far in the Bay untill he be to the &s;outhwards, or pa&s;t the head, or the bridge, and anchor there in 25 or 30 fathom. In winter time men mu&s;t not anchor &s;o near the &s;trand, becau&s;e of the &s;outhea&s;t or &s;outh&s;outhea&s;t windes, for then they &s;hould lie too near the &s;trand. Men lye there moored with two anchors for the &s;ea winde, with a &s;mall anchor out a &s;tearn for to keep the &s;hip right in the road there lyeth to the ea&s;twards of the towne a high white rock with a cro&s;&s;e, there is the be&s;t road. A little to the northwards of the town, is a faire &s;and-bay, there is good anchoring in 20, 30, or 35 fathom, according as men will lye far off, the Road is called the Rammell road. When men lie in the road of Palma, they may &s;ee the Pieck of Teneriffe lie ea&s;t&s;outhea&s;t from them. The I&s;land Palma is very high and full of trees, whereby it is ea&s;y to bee known.</P>
<P>On the &s;outhwe&s;t &s;ide of la Palma is another place, where men lade wines called Ta&s;&s;a Corda.</P>
<P>About 5 leagues we&s;t from the we&s;t end of Teneriffe, lieth the I&s;land Gomera, which hath on the n. e. &s;ide a good haven of 10 fathom deep, where is good lying almo&s;t for all windes, better then in any of the other I&s;lands, but there is nothing to lade: Men may al&s;oo anchor without before the haven in 20 fathom, but they mu&s;t &s;hift roads there as at Garrichica.</P>
<P>The road of Ade&s;&s;a in Teneriffe lieth right over again&s;t it, ea&s;t off from it about 5 leagues.</P>
<P>The road of Palma lyeth from this haven in Gomera northwe&s;t and by north 16 leagues.</P>
<P>The I&s;land Ferro lieth from the I&s;land Palma &s;outh and by we&s;t, di&s;tant 13 leagues.</P>
