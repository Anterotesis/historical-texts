<P>IN the renowned City of <HI>Famogo&s;ta,</HI> in the plea&s;ant I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in times pa&s;t, there dwelt one <HI>Thedorius,</HI> de&s;cended of noble Pa|rentage, who left him a great E&s;tate, but being brought up to no|thing but Plea&s;ure, he pur&s;ued it &s;o far in all manner of Sports and Riots, that it con&s;um'd a-pace: his friends being grieved hereat, thought of no better way to check his proceedings, and bring him with|in bounds of Moderation, than by matching him to &s;ome di&s;creet Wo|man, who&s;e Wi&s;dom and good Humour might bring him to live &s;oberly and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gally. This being, concluded on, contrary to his Knowledge, upon diligent &s;earch, they found one, &s;uitable to what they had propo&s;ed; in the City of <HI>Nicovia,</HI> a virtuous young Virgin, Daughter to a Merchant, rich and beautiful, who&s;e name was <HI>Grati|ana;</HI> and propo&s;ing it to him, with many Rea&s;ons and Arguments, how much it would be for his good, he re&s;olved to vi&s;it her, and liking
<PB REF="2"> her comely &s;hape, good features, but above all, her mode&s;t carriage, and witty expre&s;&s;ions &s;uiting his Humour, after a few months Court|&s;hip, they were married in &s;plended manner, mo&s;t of the principal Men of either City being at the Wedding, who gave large gifts, as it is the Cu&s;tom, to the Bride and Bridegroom; and &s;o for many years they lived in Content and great Felicity, in which &s;pace they had a Son whom they named <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> at who&s;e Chri&s;tening an old Wo|man taken to be a Prophete&s;s, came in and uttered the&s;e Words:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Child is Fortune's Darling, he &s;hall &s;hare,</HI></L>

</LG>
<P>This was noted of many but more particularly when the Succe&s;s an|&s;wered her Prediction. As he grew up, his Father, not be re&s;train|ed by the tears and intreaties of his Wife, &s;quandred away all his Pa|trimony; which much grieved <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> tho' he &s;aw no way to re|dre&s;s it; and his Father too late &s;eeing his Folly, fell into a deep me|lancholy, often &s;ighing, and &s;hedding Tears, which &s;o afflicted his Son, that thinking he might have done &s;omething that grieved him, he came and kneel'd before him, entreating to know what cau&s;ed his Afflictions, and if he had contributed towards them, he would amend, and do a|ny thing that might be plea&s;ing in his &s;ight? But the &s;orrowful Fa|ther &s;ighing, told him, He had been very dutiful, which was the greate&s;t comfort he had; yet being afflicted with Poverty, which had brought him to be de&s;pi&s;ed by his Inferiours, it much afflicted him. Upon this <HI>Fortunatus</HI> begged leave to rid him of the charge he put him to, by &s;uffering him to travel, not doubting, as he &s;aid, con|&s;idering his Education, but he &s;hould &s;hift for him&s;elf; and Fortune might &s;o befriend him, and enable him to do for him and his Mother, who had been &s;o tender, and gave him &s;uch liberal Education. His Father ea&s;ily con&s;ented, but his Mother not without great Reluctancy; but finding there was a nece&s;&s;ity for it, with many tender embraces they parted. <HI>Fortunatus</HI> having the World to ramble in, made to the Sea, and at the next Haven found a great many armed Men landed, which at the fir&s;t made him &s;tart, as &s;uppo&s;ing it an Inva&s;ion of the I&s;land; but he upon enquiry, found it was <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> who had put on &s;hoar to refre&s;h him, in his return from the Wars again&s;t the Turks and Sarazens in the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> he took courage, and kneeling before the Earl, offer'd his Service, telling him he was put forth to &s;eek his Fortune, and that he would be very &s;ub&s;ervient to his Commands. The Earl eying him, and perceiving
<PB REF="3"> him a very promi&s;ing Youth, of a comely Per&s;onage, after a little en|quiry into the Circum&s;tances of his Parentage and former Life, he made him his chief Servant; and &s;o well he behaved him&s;elf, that he gained this great Lord's entire Affection, and &s;o departed with him in the Gally to the next Port, which was the famous City of <HI>Venice,</HI> built in a Mar&s;h in the Sea, about three Leagues from the main Land, and de&s;ended from the raging of the Ocean with mighty Banks and mon&s;terous Pits; through whole Streets run &s;everal Chanels, &s;o that great Boats and Lighters came with Goods and Merchandize to the Doors of their Hou&s;es; <HI>Fortunatus</HI> knew the Language of this Country, which he had learn'd from a Venetion in his own; &s;o that meeting with divers Merchants there, he bought up, by his Lord's Order, &s;tore of Jewels and other rich Merchandize, which wonderfully plea&s;ed him, the which he intended to be&s;tow upon the Duke of <HI>Cleve</HI>'s Daughter to whom he was contracted (before his going to the War) and at his return de&s;igned to marry; and at this Marriage being Ju&s;ts and Turnaments, the Earl, to encourage his Servants to do well, &s;et up a Jewel valued at three hundred Crowns, to tho&s;e that &s;hould overcome, after the Nobles and Knights had ended their Debates: <HI>Fortunatus</HI> carried the Prize from them all, which made 'em greatly envy him, and the more, becau&s;e a new Comer &s;hould have the advantage of their Lord's Favour; and &s;o they con|&s;ulted together to find out a Contrivance to remove him; which they effected by this Stratagem, one <HI>Robert,</HI> an old Servant, came to him as he was reading, and told him, that their Lord being to depart and leave his Bride, was by rea&s;on of her Beauty &s;o jealous, that he had ordered Surgeons to come the next morning, to &s;ecure him&s;elf of his Servants, by gelding them. This &s;o terrified <HI>Fortunatus</HI> (the Man urging he reveal'd this in Good-will to him) that without fur|ther con&s;ideration he be&s;ought him to help him to make his E&s;cape for he would not be &s;o &s;erved for his Lord's Earldom&punc; <HI>Robert</HI> ob&s;erving this, told him he was loath to part with him; but if he would go, he de|&s;ired to know where he would re&s;ide that when the re&s;t were gelded, and his Lords Jealou&s;ie over, he might return to his Service again, and very probably e&s;cape: But he &s;aid, he would not return again, whate|ver betide him; &s;o getting a Hor&s;e (he was lead by <HI>Robert,</HI> who inward|ly was plea&s;ed, and laughed in his &s;leeve at the Fallacy he had put up|on him) and being without the Gate, rode away with all the &s;peed he could; never looking behind him, till he was many Miles from the Palace.</P>
<P>The Earl, at his return mi&s;&s;ing <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> made great enquiry
<PB REF="3"> for him; but the Servants utterly denyed they knew what was be|come of him, then he asked his Lady, whether &s;he had given him a|ny cau&s;e of Offence; but &s;he was altogether ignorant of any &s;uch thing, &s;o he was forced to content him&s;elf, though much again&s;t his will, &s;aying, However he &s;hould at one time or other find it out, and he would &s;everely puni&s;h the Occa&s;ioners of it; which made <HI>Ro|bert,</HI> who had contrived his flight much affraid, le&s;t he &s;hould return, and make a di&s;covery of what Stratagem had been u&s;ed, to cau&s;e his ab&s;enting his Lord's Service.</P>

<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> getting away in manner afore&s;aid, was re&s;olved to fol|low Fortune; and &s;o, coming by divers ways to <HI>Callis,</HI> he got pa&s;&s;age for <HI>England,</HI> where he fell into the Company of two <HI>Cyprus</HI> Merchants, and lived with them righteou&s;ly, &s;pending in Wine and upon Harlots, till his and their Stocks was utterly exhau&s;ted; and be|ing in a poor condition (void of Succou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">) his Mi&s;tre&s;s, on whom he had &s;pent his Plea&s;ure, thru&s;ted him out of Doors, and refu&s;ed to relieve him; as he wander'd about <HI>London,</HI> he was taken notice of by one <HI>Jerinomus Roberti,</HI> a Florentine Merchant, who examin|ing him, found he was of a prompt Wit and Education, and therefore
<PB REF="4"> agreed with him to come into his Service, which he joyfully accepted and being acquainted with the Cu&s;toms of Merchants, was &s;o dili|gent (and &s;o well behaved him&s;elf) that he got the good E&s;teem, not only of his Ma&s;ter, but of all the Servants, who entirely loved him: But &s;oon after a great Calamity befel the Family, by means of a Vil|lain, which co&s;t all, but <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> their Lives, and he very narrow|ly e&s;caped; for one <HI>Andrew,</HI> a young Spend-thrift Florentine, having been &s;ent by his Father, to &s;ell a Cargo of Goods, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">avi&s;hed away all the Money he had for them, but continued to draw Bills up|on the old Man, with promi&s;es of large returns, till he had near ru|ined him before he had di&s;cover'd the Cheat; at what time being put to his &s;hifts, he left <HI>England,</HI> and went for <HI>Bruges,</HI> where hearing of an Engli&s;h Merchant who lay in Irons in a noi&s;ome Dungeon, for forging the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Pa&s;s-port, he went to vi&s;it him. The Merchant no &s;ooner knew he cam from <HI>England,</HI> but he was ex|ceeding glad, enquiring what News, and the Welfare of his Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, all which he told him as well as he under&s;tood: The Merchant &s;aid, <HI>You &s;ee what in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;er able condition I lie here, if you would return to</HI> England, <HI>and acquaint my Friends with it, I make no doubt but they will u&s;e their Pur&s;es, and Interest at Court to relea&s;e me.</HI> To be brief, he promi&s;ed to do it up|on con&s;ideration of three hundred Crowns, and &s;o took the Names of tho&s;e Friends he propo&s;ed, and Mony for his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Now among this Merchant's Friends, was <HI>Roberti, Fortunatus</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, by which means this wicked Florentine came acquainted with him to his ruin; for having propo&s;ed to lay down three hundred Crowns for the Merchant's Ran&s;om, if any others would come in for Part-Security, <HI>Andrew</HI> at la&s;t told him, he had found a Gentleman of a great E&s;tate that would do it, and that he &s;hould provide a Dinner, and he would bring him; this being agreed to, he went to a Knight of the Court, whom the King had employed to get the riche&s;t Jewels that might be had, to make a Pre&s;ent to his Si&s;ter, who was to be married to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> telling him there was a Jeweller of <HI>Florence,</HI> who hearing of the King's Enquiry after Rarities, was come over with &s;uch, that the like had never been &s;een in the Nation, and &s;o invited him to come and &s;ee 'em at <HI>Roberti</HI>'s, where he &s;aid, he lodged, de&s;iring him to bring his own with him, that they might compare them. The Knight little dreaming of the Treachery de|&s;igned, promi&s;ed &s;o to do, and accordingly came, when after Dinner having him into a private Chamber he &s;tabbed him, but for what rea&s;on we knew not, for he had not brought the Jewels with him, whereupon he took his Keys and his Signet, and ran to his Hou&s;e,
<PB REF="4"> delivering them to his Wife as a Token to give him the Jewels, for the King was to &s;end them away; upon &s;earch &s;he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ind none, nor were they found for &s;ome time after; &s;o that the Murtherer, fru&s;trated of his expected Prize, came to <HI>Roberti</HI>'s again, where the Murther was di&s;cover'd by the dropping of the Blood through the Cei|ling, but he laboured to calm their O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">teries, by &s;aying, The Murther|ed was a meer Cut-throat, and de&s;igned to have killed him for this Mony; however, he would rid them of the Body: and &s;o taking it on his Shoulder, he threw it into a Privy, and fled by a Back-way for fear of being apprehended.</P>
<P>The Knight being mi&s;&s;ing, great enquiry was made; this Mer|chant's Hou&s;e, where they had Intelligence, he went, was &s;earched, but nothing found, till being about to depart, one cryed, <HI>Come, let's &s;ee in the Privy, we have not &s;earched that yet:</HI> And there, by throw|ing in a lighted Paper, they &s;aw the Murthered's heels &s;tanding up|right. The King being certified of this, the Merchant and his Ser|vants were examined by Tortures, all of them confe&s;&s;ing what they knew of the Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ther, but <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> whom they had kept ignorant of it, he being then abroad: But of the Jewels they could tell nothing, &s;o that hereupon they were condemned to be hanged; and of &s;even, only <HI>Fortunatus</HI> e&s;caped, at the Gallows, by the others prote&s;ting his Innocence in the Matter. About half a Year after, the Widow of the Knight being advi&s;ed to think of a young Lover, and remove her Bed into another Room, to put her out of her Melancholy, putting the latter in practice, found a little Cabinet under it, and in it the Jewels; which, by the Advice of a Kin&s;man, &s;he carried to the King, who, for her Fidelity, gave her the Mannor of <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> and cau&s;|ed a young Knight to marry her, &s;ettling a thou&s;and Pounds a Year up|on them during their Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunatus</HI> having lo&s;t his Ma&s;ter, and happily '&s;cap'd the Gallows, grew &s;o fearful of &s;uch another bout, that he re&s;olved to &s;tay no longer in <HI>England,</HI> but getting on board, &s;oon &s;ailed over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
