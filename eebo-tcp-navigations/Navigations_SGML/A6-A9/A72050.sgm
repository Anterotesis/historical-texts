<HEAD>CHAP. I. How King <HI>Frederick</HI> and his Queene walking to take the ayre, were a&s;&s;aulted by a company of Out-lawes, &amp; how the Queene was deliuered of a child in the Forre&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>_YOU may read in the Chronicles of Den|marke, of the great loue betw&eacute;ene King <HI>Frederick,</HI> &amp; the famous <HI>Alli&s;onne,</HI> Coun|te&s;&s;e of Flaunders. And how that after a long contention, betw&eacute;ene the &s;aid <HI>Frede|rick,</HI> and <HI>Griffory</HI> Duke of Holland, the King married her in the great Cittie of Gaunt, to the ex|treame griefe of the &s;aid <HI>Griffory,</HI> who therevpon gaue o|uer all martiall exerci&s;es for a &s;ea&s;on, vntill &s;uch time as h&eacute;e was reuenged, as you may more at large read of in the &s;aid Chronicle, written by one <HI>Cleonido</HI> a Dane.</P>
<P>Not long after the &s;aid marriage, the King hauing &s;et|led the e&s;tate of that Earledome, returned into Denmarke with his beautifull Qu&eacute;ene, where at the arriuall, they were receiued with great honour and triumph by his &s;ubiects, who loued him as intirely, as it was po&s;&s;ible for any &s;ubiects to loue their Prince, as appeared by their &s;o|lemne proce&s;&s;ions, ringing of bells, &s;taitly pagants, and other gallant &s;hewes, which were pre&s;ented vnto him in euery Towne h&eacute;e pa&s;&s;ed through. But comming into <HI>Ma|iance,</HI> which then was the chiefe Cittie of the kingdome,
<PB REF="4"> hee was pre&s;ented with &s;uch varietie of plea&s;ing &s;hewes, that it pa&s;&s;eth my capacitie to de&s;cribe them, likewi&s;e there were many excellent and learned Orations, pronounced by the chiefe &s;chollers of the Vniuer&s;ity of <HI>Maiance,</HI> &s;etting foorth the great loue of the people toward their Prince, and the ioy conceaued of his marriage with &s;o excellent a Lady as was his Qu&eacute;ene. On the other&s;ide, the King to grate|fie his &s;ubiects louing mindes, &s;hewed him&s;elfe bountifull and liberall vnto all, to &s;ome by gifts, to others by promi|&s;es and fayre words, and to all by plea&s;ing ie&s;tures, &s;o that one might rightly &s;ay, there was in him the liuely portra|ture of a mo&s;t graue and prudent Prince, and in them the true &s;hew of faithfull and louing &s;ubiects.</P>
<P>But as it alwaies hapneth, when men think them&s;elues in greate&s;t felicitie, then whether it be by the in&s;tabilitie of Fortune, or el&s;e that the Fates and de&s;tinies haue &s;o ap|pointed it, they are oftentimes &s;uddenly tumbled downe, into griefe and mi&s;erie. Euen &s;o it hapned with the King and Qu&eacute;ene, who liuing a while in this content, were &s;ud|denly driuen into great cares and perplexitie. Wherby we may perceiue, the diuine power of God to be &s;uch, that h&eacute;e can pull downe Princes from their thrones, and re&s;tore them againe at his plea&s;ure, as &s;ometimes he did by <HI>Nabu|cadnezar</HI> and others, to the &s;etting foorth of his glorie and power.</P>
<P>Now was it hard about the Month of May, when as the fields and woods were deckt with <HI>Floras</HI> broode, and on each &s;pray &s;ate louely birds, re&s;ounding heauenly harmo|nie. The pretie Nitingall, &s;etting her &s;peckled brea&s;t a|gain&s;t a bryer, regarded not fond <HI>Terius</HI> foule de&s;ire, but chaunted forth her plea&s;ant ditties. When as the King and Qu&eacute;ene, accompanied with a &s;mall traine of Lordes and Ladies whom they loued, one morning early &s;tale forth of the Court &s;ecretly, to di&s;port the~&s;elues in the forre&s;t, which was hard adioyning vnto the Citty walls, where they had not long remained, beholding the broad-&s;haded Okes, and &s;tately loftie Pines, before that a company of Out-lawes,
<PB REF="4"> who were bani&s;hed the Kingdome of Fraunce, had e&s;pyed them, and &s;&eacute;eing they were no better prouided, &s;et on them. Where one might haue beheld the Qu&eacute;ene and her Ladies &s;o affrighted with this &s;udden accident, fling vp &amp; downe, &s;ome hiding them&s;elues in one bu&s;h, &s;ome in another. O|thers againe b&eacute;eing more timerous, &s;uncke downe where they &s;toode, not b&eacute;eing able to flie away. But all was one, flie or tarry, for b&eacute;eing pur&s;ued, they were all taken, and brought backe, &s;auing onely the Qu&eacute;ene, who b&eacute;eing car|ried forwards with the wings of feare, made &s;uch ha&s;t that &s;h&eacute;e e&s;caped them all, b&eacute;eing &s;o appointed by the prouidence of God.</P>
<P>The King likewi&s;e &amp; Noblemen b&eacute;eing amazed at this vnlooked for euent, knew not well &s;uddenly what to deter|mine, but in the end, &s;&eacute;eing no other remedy, re&s;olued to defend them&s;elues as well as they might. The King being at that time one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Knights in all Europe, layd on &s;uch blowes among&s;t them, that hee made an euident &s;hew that hee was determined to &s;ell his life at an extreame d&eacute;ere rate. But beeing vnarmed, and hauing no other weapon but his &s;word, and all his company bee|ing &s;laine out-right &s;auing two, who were likewi&s;e grie|uou&s;ly wounded, was for&s;t perforce to y&eacute;elde to theyr pitti|le&s;&s;e mercy: who hauing obtaind victory, &s;tript them all, as well Lords as Ladies of their coyne, and abilliments which were ought worth. And binding tho&s;e whom they thought might any waies worke them di&s;plea&s;ure, as by ray&s;ing power to pur&s;ue them, or vnbinding their fellows, they determined &s;p&eacute;edily to depart towards the Sea coa&s;t, where &s;ome of their company remained, with two &s;mall Barks, wherewith they cro&s;t the &s;eas. But as they were ready to depart, it came into one of their mindes, that &s;ome of them whom they had robbed, might peraduenture be &s;uch per&s;ons, for who&s;e raun&s;ome, they might get more coyne then all theyr booty was worth: wherefore demaun|ding of one of the Ladies who~ they had bound, what they were, was giuen to vnder&s;tand, that hee who made the
<PB REF="5"> greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tance was the King, the other two which were liuing, both noble men of his Court. Then calling to his mind, the great hate betw&eacute;ene the &s;aid King, and <HI>Grif|fory</HI> Duke of Holland, determined if he could, to cary him with him, and to pre&s;ent him to the Duke, of whom he ho|ped to receiue &s;ome great reward. Wherefore intreating his fellowes, who knew not who~ they had robbed, &s;o grant him &s;o much fauour, as to permit him to haue that Knight for his pri&s;oner, in regard as knowing him heeretofore in Fraunce, fayning that there he had doone great de&s;pight to a friend of his, in reuenge whereof hee would deliuer him into his hands, whom he knew would k&eacute;epe him in eternal pri&s;on for his former offence. Nowe if they would be con|tented to grant this vnto him, hee would &s;&eacute;eke for no other part of their bootie.</P>
<P>They all b&eacute;eing more gr&eacute;edy of pray then of pri&s;oners, who they thought might rather be a charge, then profit vn|to them, were content to graunt vnto his reque&s;t. Who pre&s;ently went and vnbound the King, and &s;o led him di|rectly towards theyr &s;hipping. And hauing winde at will, pre&s;ently wayed Ancor, and &s;et into the Sea, where wee will leaue them for awhile, and returne to the Qu&eacute;ene, who by her &s;wift flight, mi&s;t the hands of the thieues, but fell into as great or greater ill. For whil&s;t the King and the other Lords held the thieues &s;omewhat &s;hort, by defending them&s;elues, as is before declared, the fearefull Qu&eacute;ene fly|ing into the wood for &s;afety, &s;trayed two and fro &s;hee wi&s;t not whether. At length, b&eacute;eing wearied with running, and fainting &s;till with feare, &s;h&eacute;e &s;ate her downe vnder a Iu|niper bu&s;h, to refre&s;h her &s;elfe, where after &s;hee had awhile re&s;ted her &s;elfe, &s;h&eacute;e began to call to mind, and con&s;ider in what great danger &s;h&eacute;e had left her Lord &amp; hu&s;band, then reprouing her&s;elfe, for that &s;he had not rather made choyce to haue &s;tayed and ended her dayes with him, then thus to haue romed &s;he wi&s;t not whether. Then ri&s;ing vp, &s;hee de|termined to haue returned to the &s;ame place where &s;he left them fighting, but &s;trayed further, &s;o that tracing and tra|uer&s;ing
<PB REF="5"> vp and downe the wood, &s;hee &s;pent the whole day to her no &s;mall griefe. And now darke night hauing &s;pred her &s;able mantle ouer the face of the earth, the &s;orrowfull Qu&eacute;ene, not knowing what to doe, or whether to goe, de|termined to take vp her lodging for y^t night, vnder a broade branched Oake, fa&s;t by a fountaines &s;ide, wheras the wild bea&s;ts of the Forre&s;t did commonly re&s;ort to drinke, where good Lady &s;h&eacute;e was forced to content her&s;elfe with a hun|gry pittance, teares b&eacute;eing her daintie&s;t di&s;h, whereon &s;h&eacute;e fedde, &s;ometimes exclayming on cruell fortune, whom &s;h&eacute;e accu&s;ed to haue brought her into the&s;e mi&s;eries: then pre|&s;ently her hu&s;bands portrature &s;&eacute;emed to appeare vnto her minde, whom &s;he thought to be murdred by tho&s;e robbers, which was &s;uch a griefe vnto her, that many times &s;he was minded to haue &s;laine her &s;elfe, had not God mightily pre|&s;erued her to a further &s;etting forth of his glory.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;t &s;h&eacute;e away mo&s;t part of the night with wee|ping and lamentations, vntill &s;uch time that <HI>Somnus</HI> with his leaden wings &s;ea&s;ed her eye-lids, and cau&s;ed her for a while to &s;lumber. In which &s;l&eacute;epe, &s;hee thought an Angell &s;ent from God, being clothed all in white rayment, appea|red vnto her, &s;aying, Bee of good hart and feare not, for the&s;e cro&s;&s;es which now are come vpon th&eacute;e, the Lord hath &s;ent to proue th&eacute;e with all, and therefore it behooueth th&eacute;e to beare it patiently, vntill &s;uch time as the Lord &s;hall ea&s;e th&eacute;e of them. As for the King thy hu&s;band he liueth, but yet in bands, and &s;hall doe &s;till, vntill &s;uch time as the childe that now is in thy wombe, &s;hall be his deliuerer, whom thou at his birth &s;halt name <HI>Euordanus,</HI> this nowe am I &s;ent to tell thee, becau&s;e thou &s;houlde&s;t not di&s;payre.</P>
<P>The Qu&eacute;ene h&eacute;ereat awaked out of her &s;lumber, and looking about if &s;he might &s;&eacute;e any body, but could not, then perceiuing it to be a dreame, or vi&s;ion, meruailed what it might &s;ignifie, &amp; was greatly troubled with deui&s;ing there|of: &s;o that all the night after &s;hee could take no re&s;t, &s;ome|times thinking of her hu&s;band, and &s;ometimes what the childes deliuerance might meane, at length determined to
<PB REF="6"> referre all to the mercifull prouidence of God. Thus &s;its &s;h&eacute;e poore &s;orrowfull Lady, till &s;uch time as by the &s;inging of the ch&eacute;erefull Larke, &amp; by the roaring of the wild bea&s;ts, &s;h&eacute;e was preparing to for&s;ake Dame <HI>Thetis</HI> lodging, and that nights &s;able mantle was changed into a hoary gray. When loe, as was their wont, the &s;auage bea&s;ts came vn|to the well to drink, there did &s;hee with feare beholde the &s;tatelie Vnicorne, with the cruell Tiger, y^e roaring Beare, and gaudy Panther, the bellowing Bull, &amp; foming Bore, the rauening Wolfe, and craftie Foxe, with diuers more, which put her in &s;uch feare, that &s;he had thought pre&s;ently to haue b&eacute;en deuoured, when &s;alling on her kn&eacute;es, and hol|ding vp her hands, &s;he &s;aid the&s;e or &s;uch like words.</P>
<P>O mo&s;t mercifull Lord God, I doe here acknowledge be|fore thy diuine maie&s;tie, my manifolde and innumerable &s;ins committed again&s;t thy diuine maie&s;ty both in thought, word, and d&eacute;ed, O Lord I am not worthy &s;o much as once to looke vp to heauen, much le&s;&s;e to receiue any thing at thy hands O Lord. Yet mercifull Father, tru&s;ting in the me|rits of thy d&eacute;erely beloued &s;onne, our Lord and Sauiour Chri&s;t Ie&s;us, I come vnto th&eacute;e in his name, crauing for|giuene&s;&s;e of all my &s;innes and iniquities. And further, O Lord God, I humbly be&s;&eacute;ech th&eacute;e to &s;aue and deliuer m&eacute;e, from this pre&s;ent danger, and perrill of my wretched life, O Lord bow downe thy heauenly eye, and behold mee thy wofull handmaide, and likewi&s;e this poore infant that is within my wombe, defend it, O Lord, and grant that ac|cording vnto the vi&s;ion which thou by thy holy Angell ha&s;t &s;hewed mee, it may liue to &s;et foorth thy glory and power, and in the end, when it &s;hall be thy ble&s;&s;ed will, to call vs out of this wretched vale of wickednes, thou wilt receiue and place vs in thy Cele&s;tiall kingdome, whether O Lord for thy &s;onnes &s;ake bring vs I be&s;&eacute;ech th&eacute;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e, or &s;uch like were the words, which &s;he di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady then vttered: when behold a mightie &s;urious Lyon came ru&s;hing out of the wood towards her, bringing in his mouth a cake of Bread, which he mo&s;t gently layd downe
<PB REF="6"> at her f&eacute;ete, fawning vpon her, as if of long time he had bin acquainted with her, and would not depart from her. At length, &s;omewhat to recomfort her&s;elfe, then &s;moothing his rough bri&s;tles with her tender hand, &s;he made much of him laying his head on her lap, wherat he &s;&eacute;emed to take great content. Then taking vp the cake of bread which hee had brought her, and giuing thanks vnto God, imagining as &s;ometimes in the wildernes hee had &s;ent Rauens to feede the Prophet <HI>Elias,</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e had hee now &s;ent the Lion to comfort and bring her foode, &s;he refre&s;hed therwith her hun|gry &s;tomacke. After which repa&s;t, the Lyon very &s;oftly pa|ced towards the wood againe, euer ca&s;ting backe his head, as if he looked whether y^e Lady followed him or not, which &s;h&eacute;e at length perceiuing, determined to follow him, hoping thereby either to get out of the wood, or el&s;e to finde &s;ome better place of &s;afety. Thus went they together, till at la&s;t he brought her vnto a Caue vnderneath the ground, with a very narrow entrance in, but b&eacute;eing entred, &s;h&eacute;e found it a rea&s;onable large roome. Thus determining for a while to remaine th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch time as God &s;hould &s;end her better fortune, pa&s;&s;ing away the time &s;ome whiles with walking about the woods n&eacute;ere the Caue, otherwhiles with playing with the Lyon, who euery day brought her in meate, &s;uch as he got abrode in the Forre&s;t, which &s;he &s;ometimes &s;cor|ched and dryed in the &s;unne, otherwhiles was forced to eate it raw, vntill &s;uch time as by hap one day walking abroad, &s;he found a flint &s;tone, with which afterwards &s;hee v&s;ed to &s;trike fire, and therewith would broyle her meate. Thus continued &s;he, vntill &s;uch time, that according to the natu|rall cour&s;e of women, her time of childe-birth was come. When as good Lady, f&eacute;eling the paines thereof, to her mo&s;t &s;trange and extreame, not hauing any to comfort and help her, &s;he fell againe into her wonted pa&s;&s;ion of dolour, com|plaining of her cruell fortune, which had depriued her of all helpe and comfort, &amp; had brought her into this extreame &s;orrow &amp; paines. But euen then, in the mid&s;t of her com|plaints, God pittying her griefe, &s;ent her &s;afe deliuerance
<PB REF="7"> of a mo&s;t goodly and beautiful boy, which when &s;he beheld, according to the &s;aying of the Scripture, &s;he forgate all her former &s;orrow, reioycing that a man child was borne into the world: and giuing thanks vnto God, &s;he tooke the child vp in her armes, and beholding it, &s;he imagined that in him &s;he &s;aw the liuely figure of the King her hu&s;band. And ma|king &s;uch &s;hift as &s;hee could to wrap him vp in clothes, &s;hee beheld on his right &s;houlder a well proportioned cro&s;&s;e, which &s;&eacute;emed farre redder then the re&s;t of his body, wherat &s;h&eacute;e greatly meruailed: then calling to minde her vi&s;ion, &s;he hoped that in time he &s;hould prooue a famous man, and a &s;courge vnto the enemies of the Chri&s;tian faith, as &s;hee thought the &s;igne of the Cro&s;&s;e did already fore&s;hew, then likewi&s;e remembring the name which the Angell had tolde her in her vi&s;ion, as &s;oone as &s;he had recouered &s;trength to goe, went with her &s;onne to the fountaine, where &s;hee bap|tized him, naming him as &s;he was willed, <HI>Euordanus,</HI> then returned &s;he againe to the Caue, where wee will leaue her for a while with her young Infant, and returne to &s;peake of the King her hu&s;band.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How King <HI>Fredericke</HI> being carried away by the Out-lawes, after a great &s;torme at &s;ea arriued in Holland, whereas he was &s;old to his mortall enemie, the Duke <HI>Griffory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AFter the Out-lawes had brought theyr boo|tie and good King aboord, and had &s;et &s;ayle, minding to haue gone for &s;ome place of Fraunce, where they might haue &s;ecretlie &s;tolne a&s;hore, to learne &s;ome newes of theyr owne affayres, and hauing the wind large, determined to haue landed in a &s;mall cricke not farre from Rotchell, be|cau&s;e mo&s;t of them were h&eacute;eretofore inhabitants of that Towne, but euen as they were come within the &s;ight of Land, on a &s;udden the Skyes began to ouerca&s;t, the &s;unne was clowded, and the face of heauen was &s;o darkned, that
<PB REF="7"> one could not di&s;cerne at that pre&s;ent time, beeing about no one dayes from the darke&s;t midnight: the winds began to blow on all &s;ides, as if that <HI>Eolus</HI> had vn&s;topped all his ayrie Caue, and had determined with one a&s;&s;ault to haue &s;ubdued <HI>Neptunes</HI> Regiments. Or as when the angry Godde&s;&s;e <HI>Iuno</HI> gr&eacute;euing at the quiet pa&s;&s;age of the poore vanqui&s;ht Troians, de&s;ired <HI>Eolus</HI> to &s;inke them in the &s;ea: &s;o fared it with them, by rea&s;on that the &s;eas on all &s;ides b&eacute;eing &s;o a&s;&s;aulted of the windes, did &s;o cruelly rage and &s;torme, that &s;ometimes theyr &s;mall Barks did &s;&eacute;eme to touch the very clowdes, and pre&s;ently againe were throwne downe vnto the &s;ands, euery man imagining that to be the la&s;t houre of theyr liues. Some, as is commonlie the cu&s;tome of &s;uch people b&eacute;eing in extremity, fel to prayer, other&s;ome to cur&s;ing and &s;wearing: the Mai&s;ter cries in with the &s;ayles, others cry downe with the Ma&s;t, &s;ome a|gaine, to lighten their Barke of her burthen, the more yar|ly to ri&s;e with the Seas, beginne to throw ouer boord all what&s;oeuer comes to hand, hoping thereby, as with a plea|&s;ing &s;acrifice, to appea&s;e the angry Seas.</P>
<P>But euen as they were thus bu&s;ied, &s;ome on one thing, others on another thing, a mighty gu&s;t in manner of a Whirlewind, comming out of the South-we&s;t, beares both ma&s;ts and &s;ayles by the burden. The Barke wherein the King was, hauing &s;pent both their fore and maine Ma&s;t, were forced to put to hull, y&eacute;elding them&s;elues to the pitti|le&s;&s;e mercy of the wind and &s;eas, which euery minute was ready to haue deuoured &amp; &s;wallowed them vp. Thus conti|nued the &s;torme by the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e dayes, the wind &s;ome|times in their for&s;hyp, then in theyr poupe, nowe in the quarter, and pre&s;ently againe in theyr bowe, continuing with &s;uch force, that the be&s;t man aboord was &s;carcely able to &s;tand on the hatches. But at length, as euery &s;torme hath an end, &s;o now <HI>Neptune</HI> rou&s;ing him&s;elfe out of his fayre Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Amphitries</HI> bo&s;ome, and beholding &s;he poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Marriners, tooke pitty on theyr mi&s;eries, and lif|ting his hoary head aboue the waters, a&s;&s;waged them, and
<PB REF="8"> with his thr&eacute;e-forked Mace rebuked the Windes, threat|ning to puni&s;h theyr arrogant pre&s;umption, if he h&eacute;ereafter hapned to find them with the like offence.</P>
<P>The &s;torme b&eacute;eing thus broken vp, and the Sunne be|ginning againe to lighten the earth with his &s;plendant beames, the weather-beathen Marriners looking abroade for theyr comfort, e&s;pied the Land, which after they had a while with ioy beheld, they made to be the Land of <HI>Hol|land.</HI> Who then &s;o glad as <HI>Martinus,</HI> for &s;o was h&eacute;e called which had the King to his pri&s;oner, for whom he hoped ere long to receiue &s;uch a &s;umme of money, as for euer &s;hould make him rich: the King on the other &s;ide was in as great perplexity, knowing that they were arriued on the coa&s;t of his greate&s;t enemy, yet comforting him&s;elfe &s;omewhat with the hope of not beeing knowne, as al&s;o of not knowing <HI>Martinus</HI> meaning, he &s;hewed him&s;elfe the more ch&eacute;erefull. Thus betw&eacute;ene hope and feare, they altogether pa&s;&s;ed a|way the time, in merry di&s;cour&s;es of theyr former danger, till &s;uch time as they were come on land, at a Port called <HI>Alentmaer,</HI> where <HI>Martinus</HI> fayning him&s;elfe to be verie ill at ea&s;e, by rea&s;on of the late &s;torme, craued leaue of the re&s;t of his company, to goe with his pri&s;oner vnto the Citty of <HI>Han&s;tance,</HI> which was not pa&s;&s;ing thr&eacute;e leagues of, now called <HI>An&s;terdam:</HI> where hee determined to re&s;t him&s;elfe, vntill &s;uch time as hee found him&s;elfe throughly amended, which they &s;oone graunted him, not knowing his intent, and beeing al&s;o willing to be ridde of his company, becau&s;e of his double charge.</P>
<P>So departed <HI>Martinus</HI> with his pri&s;oner, whom he &s;wore &s;o continue true vnto him: as fearing his e&s;cape, being to trauell but they two together, but the King being in his enemies country, dur&s;t not make him&s;elfe knowne, which he mu&s;t needes, if he had made any re&s;i&s;tance. Thus tra|uelling on together towards <HI>Han&s;tance,</HI> they ariued there at &s;uch time, as the blu&s;hing &s;unne plucking in his &s;miling beames, making his &s;teedes to mende their wonted place, and plunging downe into the Ocean &s;treames, there in
<PB REF="8"> the frothy waues did hide his face, leauing the earth coue|red with nights dark&s;ome &s;hade: wherefore that night they tooke vp their lodging, <HI>Martinus</HI> learning of his hao&s;t, how Duke <HI>Griffory</HI> hauing euer &s;ince &s;he marriage of the King of Denmarke, and the faire Lady <HI>Alli&s;on</HI> of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> giuen ouer all plea&s;ure, was withdrawne from his Court into the Country, &s;ome eight miles di&s;tance from the Cittie: where hauing built a lodge in a maruilous &s;oli|tarie place, hee pa&s;&s;ed the time in mellancholly humors, &s;omewhiles playing on the Lute &s;ome mournefull ditties, otherwhiles, ingrauing in the trees on the ground Ver&s;es and Sonnets, f&eacute;eding his humors with &s;uch vaine toies, to the great griefe of all his &s;ubiects: and how in all that time he neuer had &s;ufferd any one to come into his pre&s;ence, or to &s;peake with him, &s;auing a &s;male company of his atten|dants, which remained there with him. When <HI>Martinus</HI> had heard all this, he determined y^e next day to goe thether, and to make knowne vnto him tho&s;e things, which &s;hould &s;oone put him out of his melancholy dumpes. The next morning very early he was ri&s;&s;en vp, and comming to the King, told him how that hee had &s;ome occa&s;ion of bu&s;ines in the Country, which would cau&s;e him to be away a day or two, wherefore hee was determined in the meane time, leauing him behind him, to cau&s;e him once more to &s;weare vnto him, to remaine vntill his returne, which if hee refu|&s;ed, that then he would commit him vnto &s;ome pri&s;on with|in the Cittie, whereas hee &s;hould bee alwaies foorth com|ming at his plea&s;ure. The King li&s;tning attentiuely vnto his &s;peech, was driuen into a thou&s;and imaginations, not knowing what was be&s;t for him to doe, at length con&s;i|dering his former oath, which rather then he would violate, he would chu&s;e to indure any death what&s;oeuer, &s;o much did he e&s;t&eacute;eme of his Kingly oath: hee an&s;wered him thus. I knowe not what your meaning may bee, in this &s;ort to doubt my former promi&s;e, and to goe about by a new oath to a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe of me: if to &s;et me to ran&s;ome, I heere fr&eacute;ely proffer my &s;elfe to goe a long with you into any place,
<PB REF="9"> out of this accur&s;ed region, and there to remaine, vntill &s;uch time that the &s;ame bee payed vnto you, although it &s;hould amounte vnto an hundred thou&s;and pounds, rather then that you &s;hould deliuer me, into the hands of the Go|uernor of this accur&s;ed Country, who is my mortall ene|mie.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, replied <HI>Martinus,</HI> being blinded with couetou&s;|nes, and hoping for a greater &s;umme of monie: there is no &s;uch matter ment, but I haue not farre off a friend, who&s;e councell I minde to followe heerein: in the meane time chu&s;e whether you will remaine in pri&s;on, or vppon your oath. The King &s;&eacute;eing no remedie, &s;ware vnto him againe to continue his true pri&s;oner, although it co&s;t him his life.</P>
<P>Then departed <HI>Martinus,</HI> towards the Dukes lodge, where b&eacute;eing arriued, and de&s;iring conference with his grace, touching &s;uch matters as n&eacute;erely concerned him, he was at length brought into a garden, in forme much like vnto an endle&s;&s;e laborinth, &s;o many were the diuers and &s;undry walkes and allies, couered with many kinds of trees, which yeilded &s;uch a clo&s;e &s;hadow, that the Sunne with his &s;plendant beames could &s;car&s;e &s;hinne through: and pa&s;&s;ing thus from one walke into another, he came at length where the Duke &s;ate in an Arbor of Baies, beeing clothed all in blacke, &s;ignifying his great &s;orrowe which he &s;u&s;tained, and hauing a Lute in his hand, was playing a mornefull dittie, which he euen then had framed, to which <HI>Martinus</HI> and his guide a while li&s;tned, vn&s;&eacute;ene by rea&s;on of the thicknes of the Arbor.</P>
<P>At length comming n&eacute;erer, and with reuerence &s;aluting his excellencie, <HI>Martinus</HI> &s;pake as followeth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t mightie and pui&s;&s;ant Prince, I cannot but woun|der that you who heeretofore, were wont to &s;pend your time in mo&s;t honorable exerci&s;es, as Tilt and Turnie, and following hautie d&eacute;edes of Chiualrie, &s;hould &s;o giue your &s;elfe ouer vnto this &s;olitarie kind of life, neither regarding your owne e&s;tate, nor the e&s;tate of your louing &s;ubiects and Country: which would &s;pend their very liues to worke
<PB REF="9"> your content. But if I bee not deceaued, this &s;trange hu|mor wherewith you are po&s;&s;e&s;t, proc&eacute;edeth from contrarie occa&s;ions, the one is the extreame hate you beare vnto the King of Denmarke, the other ouer much loue towards the beautifull Qu&eacute;ene his wife, not knowing with your &s;elfe what way to be reuenged of him, nor how to regaine her loue. But &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t mighty Prince, I &s;hould worke the meanes of your reuenge, by deliuering him into your hands, would not it content you? yea would you not more reioyce thereof, then to haue gained the greate&s;t Cittie in Chri&s;tendome, and likewi&s;e reward him, that &s;hould effect the &s;ame to his content: &s;peake O worthy Duke, were not the&s;e the occa&s;ions of thy griefe, and would not this like|wi&s;e be the chiefe&s;t medicine to &s;ea&s;e thy &s;orrowe.</P>
<P>Scarce were the&s;e la&s;t words vttered, when the Duke &s;tarting vp, and &s;taring him in the face, as one wakned out of &s;ound &s;l&eacute;epe, thus replied. Friend, what&s;oeuer thou art that &s;&eacute;eke&s;t by a fayned and filed tale, to driue me out of my &s;ad pa&s;&s;ions; knowe that to ie&s;t with Princes is not tollerable: But if thou can&s;t performe, that whereof thou ha&s;t made &s;howe of, I will not be &s;lacke in rewarding th&eacute;e for thy paines, though thou &s;houlde&s;t demaunde halfe my Dukedome. Therefore tell me by what meanes this may be accompli&s;hed: then effect and bring it to pa&s;&s;e, and I will reward th&eacute;e to thy owne content. Worthy Duke re|plied <HI>Martinus,</HI> if I performe it not, then let my head bee &s;triken from my &s;houlders, conditionally that if I doe deli|uer into thy hands, that vnhappie King, I may haue for my reward the Citty of <HI>Han&s;tance</HI> during my life, with the profits thereof: and this confirme vnto mee before your Nobilitie, and then I will deliuer him into your hands, within this eight daies next comming.</P>
<P>The Duke being filled with ioy, with this his &s;o com|fortable newes, con&s;ented vnto what&s;oeuer he demanded, and calling for a Knight which was n&eacute;ere&s;t vnto him, wil|led him to &s;ommon his Coun&s;ell the next day, to bee atten|dant to heare a matter of importance, which he would &s;how
<PB REF="10"> vnto them: which was foorthwith accompli&s;hed, euery one the next day at their houre appointed, beeing ready in the Coun&s;ell chamber, to heare what &s;hould be their Princes will: euery one greatly meruailing what &s;oden motion, was entred in his head, con&s;idering that by the &s;pace of a y&eacute;ere before, he had neuer conferred with them of any mat|ter, no nor once &s;uffered them to come into his pre&s;ence. They being as I haue &s;ayd gathered together in the Coun|&s;ell chamber, the Duke leading <HI>Martinus</HI> by the hand, came vnto them, where he declared his intent, with the promi&s;e of <HI>Martinus:</HI> all which was con&s;ented vnto by them, hoping thereby to haue their Prince in his former e&s;tate of content: A&s;&s;uring vnto <HI>Martinus</HI> vnder their hands and &s;eales, that what&s;oeuer the Duke had made promi&s;e of, they would &s;ee it performed, &s;o &s;oone as h&eacute;e &s;hould deliuer the King of Denmarke into their hands. H&eacute;ere will I leaue them to tell of the great griefe, made through all Denmarke, for the lo&s;&s;e of their King and Qu&eacute;ene.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. How the King and Queene beeing found mi&s;&s;ing, were &s;ought for, and how the Lords and Ladies that were with them were found.</HEAD>
<P>_THe &s;ame morning that the King and Qu&eacute;ene went to recreate them&s;elues in the forre&s;t, as is before declared, they were not fou~d mi&s;&s;ing, till &s;uch time as y^e tables being &s;pred for diner, and many Lords and Ladies, Knights, Squi|ers, and Gentlemen, being a&s;&s;embled together to giue their attendance on his Maie&s;tie, maruailed that hee was &s;o long, before he came downe into the great Hall, contra|rie to his v&s;e, which was alwaies wont to be by tenne of the clocke, where he remained vntill dinner time, pa&s;&s;ing away the time with mirth and plea&s;ant di&s;ports. At length hauing expected his comming vntill twelue of the clocke,
<PB REF="10"> and &s;&eacute;eing that he came not, the Lord Trea&s;ure, who&s;e name was Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> mu&s;ing what the cau&s;e might be, and doubting that all was not well, in regard hee neither came him&s;elfe, neither any of the Squiers, which were at|tending n&eacute;ere&s;t vnto him were &s;&eacute;ene to come downe, to de|clare the cau&s;e, at length went vp vnto the Kings bed|chamber, where hee found the Chamberlin with diuers o|ther Gentlemen, which alwaies attended on the Kings owne per&s;on. And demaunding of them where his Maie|&s;tie was, that he came not downe in the Hall as he was accu&s;tomed, they all gaue him an&s;were, that the King and Qu&eacute;ene, accompanied with the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> his Co&s;in, the Lord <HI>Bewdall,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with &s;ome La|dies and attendants, in the morning very early went forth at the Po&s;terne, towards the Forre&s;t to take the fre&s;h aire, and that &s;ince that time they were not returned, neither did they know farther what was become of them, but doubted lea&s;t that they had &s;trayed &s;o farre within the wood, that they had lo&s;t their way forth. When Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had hard this, he was much ama&s;ed, &amp; greatly troubled in mind, fea|ring lea&s;t there had b&eacute;ene &s;ome trea&s;on wrought again&s;t his Maie&s;tie: wherefore cau&s;ing the reporters of the&s;e newes, to be in &s;ure k&eacute;eping, he went downe, and declared the &s;ame to the re&s;t of the nobility, and taking coun&s;ell to|gether, they determined forthwith to make ageneral &s;earch, as well for the King and Qu&eacute;ene, and nobles found wan|ting, as al&s;o for all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, which might b&eacute;e thought any waies guilty towards their ab&s;ence: likewi&s;e they determined, to make a generall &s;earch throughout all the Forre&s;t, lea&s;t peraduenture, they were hapned to goe a|&s;tray, and could not find the ready way backe againe, or if that they were any way di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, either by th&eacute;eues or wild bea&s;ts, that then they might re&s;cue them, or find what was become of them.</P>
<P>Thus hauing determined, they armed them&s;elues, to the number of thr&eacute;e thou&s;and, Knights and Gentlemen, and being mounted on their hor&s;es, they tooke the way di|rectly
<PB REF="11"> towards the Forre&s;t, where beeing ariued they &s;e|perated them&s;elues into diuers companies, &s;&eacute;eking vp and downe, and looking almo&s;t in euery bu&s;h, but could not find them whom they &s;ought for, at length Sir <HI>Henault</HI> with his companie hapning to pa&s;&s;e that way, wherein the morning the fight had b&eacute;ene, chaunced fir&s;t to finde &s;ome of the dead bodies, and looking farther, &s;awe whereas the Lords and Ladies lay bound, being almo&s;t dead with the paine and griefe which they &s;u&s;tained, y^e Lords by rea|&s;on of their wounds, and Ladies by the feare wherein they were put: then comming more n&eacute;ere vnto them, they found the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> grieuou&s;ly wounded, the Lord <HI>Bewdall</HI> with &s;ome foure or fiue other Gentlemen &s;laine out right, which &s;ight &s;trake &s;uch a griefe and &s;orrow into the harts of all the beholders, e&s;pecially of Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> that he had much to doe to &s;it on his hor&s;e, yet at length recouering his &s;ences, and cau&s;ing them to be vnbound, he demaunded what was become of the King and Qu&eacute;ene, and by what mi&s;fortune they were brought into this pittifull ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> hauing his wounds bound vp, and being &s;omewhat refre&s;hed and reuiued with &s;uch re&s;tora|tiues, as &s;ome of the companie had brought with them, an|&s;wered, how that walking to take the aire, and to view tho&s;e plea&s;ant &s;hades, they were &s;odenly and vnawares &s;et on by forty th&eacute;eues or Outlawes, whom by their apparrell and &s;p&eacute;ech, they iudged to be frenchmen, where defending them&s;elues as well as they might, were in the end thus ouercome and wounded: and as for the King, after they had bound vs and were departing away, hauing before &s;tripped vs of the wealth we had about vs, they returned and tooke him with them, towards the &s;ea-&s;ide. But of the Qu&eacute;ene, we knowe no certainty, for whil&s;t we were figh|ting &s;he fled into the wood, with the re&s;t of the Ladies, who were all brought back againe &s;aue the Qu&eacute;ene only, by &s;ome of the Outlawes who per&s;ued them: more I knowe not, but feare lea&s;t they likewi&s;e hapned on her, and haue
<PB REF="11"> carried her with them: wherefore he thought it fit that pur|&s;ute might be made after them to the &s;eawards, where if they were not already gone, it might &s;o fortune as they might recouer the King and Qu&eacute;ene againe, otherwi&s;e there would be no hope left for &s;&eacute;eing them in ha&s;t.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had heard this di&s;cour&s;e made by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> he was &s;o grieued inwardly, that with extreame &s;orrowe he fell from his hor&s;e in a trance, and be|ing brought againe to him&s;elfe, &s;&eacute;eing all things were to be followed according to the occa&s;ion and time, fir&s;t he com|maunded, &s;ome part of his companie to conuaie the Lords and Ladies to the Court, whereas they that were woun|ded might find helpe for to cure the &s;ame: and they likewi&s;e that were &s;laine, might euery one haue buriall according to their e&s;tates: him&s;elfe in the meane &s;pace being accom|panied with a hundred Knights, would followe after the th&eacute;eues, hoping that if they were not put to &s;ea before their comming, not only to re&s;cue the King, but al&s;o to giue them &s;uch a reward as for euer &s;hould bee an example, to tho&s;e who &s;hould goe about to attempt the like. With this deter|mination they rode on towards the &s;ea &s;ide, whereas they arriued, about the time, when <HI>Ve&s;perus,</HI> in the we&s;t had &s;et the cunning watch, and &s;ilent night richly attended by his twinckling traine, &s;ent &s;l&eacute;epe and &s;lumber to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the world, and fantazie for to hazan idle heads, whereas they found their labor fruitle&s;&s;e, by rea&s;on that they were departed long before: and &s;&eacute;eing the night beginne to wax darke, they all together determined on the plaine, hard by the &s;ea &s;ide for that night to re&s;t them&s;elues, making fiers and great lights to cau&s;e the re&s;t of their companies to come vnto them, who likewi&s;e had made a long and bootle&s;&s;e &s;earch in the wood, and at length being almo&s;t all come to|gether, where Sir <HI>Henault</HI> remained, they determined the next day to make preperation to follow them by &s;ea, whom they could not recouer on &s;hore.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII. Of the generall lamentation that was made throughout all the Kingdome, and how that after a councell held for the gouerning thereof, the Knights and noble men tooke on them the &s;earch of the King.</HEAD>
<P>_THE next day, no &s;ooner had darke night ta|ken his leaue, and that the day began to ap|peare in the Ea&s;t, but Sir <HI>Henault</HI> with the re&s;t of his company, were mounted on hor&s;|back, taking their way towards the &s;orrow|full Cittie of <HI>Maiance,</HI> where b&eacute;eing arriued, they found the Citty all full of heauines, by rea&s;on of the late newes, which at their comming was &s;o much the more augmen|ted, being returned without any certaine knowledge what was become of the King and Qu&eacute;ene. There might you haue &s;&eacute;ene the true di&s;cription of &s;orrow, not in one onelie creature, but in generall through the whole Cittie: &s;ome fell to &s;hutting vp their doores and windowes, as minding for very griefe to inclo&s;e them&s;elues pri&s;oners in their own hou&s;es, &s;hunning the day light, which had giuen light to tho&s;e Robbers, who had di&s;poyled them of their ioy and comfort. Others againe clad in blacke mournfull attire, with their ch&eacute;eks be &s;pred with teares, which like &s;treames trickled downe from the fountaines of their eyes, went vp and downe lamenting and bewailing the lo&s;&s;e of theyr &s;o louing and gracious Prince. The late co&s;tly &s;hewes, and &s;tately Pagants, were turned into &s;adde obiects: yea, no noy&s;e was heard through the whole Cittie, but w&eacute;eping and lamentation, &s;o that the &s;orrow &s;u&s;tained by the Tro|ians, for the lo&s;&s;e of their chiefe Champion <HI>Hector,</HI> when by the Gr&eacute;eks, at the commaundement of cruell <HI>A|chilles,</HI> he was thr&eacute;e times dragd about their Cittie walls, b&eacute;eing before hand cowardly &s;laine with his accur&s;ed Speare, was not to bee compared with this of <HI>Maiance.</HI> The graue and mode&s;t Matrons, were &s;&eacute;ene with theyr
<PB REF="12"> garments rent, and their haire di&s;per&s;ed about their &s;houl|ders, in mo&s;t dolefull manner to repayre to the Temples, where before the mo&s;t Highe&s;t, they poured foorth theyr prayers for their Soueraigne, bathing them&s;elues with the teares which fell from their eyes. The young dam&s;els plea&s;ant &s;ongs, which with cl&eacute;ere and ch&eacute;erfull bre&s;ts they were wont to record, were now turned into &s;ad &amp; mourn|full ditties, bewailing the lo&s;&s;e of their Countries protec|tor. Yea, &s;o generall was the gr&eacute;efe vnto all manner of e|&s;tates, that for the &s;pace of fortie dayes together, there was neither &s;hops opened, nor any wares or merchandi&s;e &s;olde in their markets. So that the towne, which was wont to be &s;o filled with all &s;orts of people, now &s;&eacute;emed in a manner to be voyde &amp; de&s;olate, none, or very few &s;&eacute;ene at any time to walke in the &s;tr&eacute;ets. Neither was the griefe in the coun|try any le&s;&s;e, yea throughout the whole kingdome: &s;o ge|nerally was he beloued of all his &s;ubiects, y^t hee was coun|ted not onely a iu&s;t Prince, but al&s;o a louing Father to his Country, alwaies defending the poore from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the rich, and the de&s;olate widdowes and Orphans, from the violence of tho&s;e, who by any meanes &s;ought to wrong them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> as we haue before &s;aid, b&eacute;eing returned to <HI>Maiance,</HI> cau&s;ed foorthwith &s;ome &s;mall Barkes to be well manned and &s;ent foorth after the Pyrats, with commaund not onely to &s;coure their owne Coa&s;t, but al&s;o to pur&s;ue the~ vnto the borders of <HI>Fraunce:</HI> where they tooke many, but could not m&eacute;et with any of the~ which they &s;ought for. Then calling a generall Coun&s;ell of all the Nobility and P&eacute;eres of the Land, where after a long &amp; learned Oration by him pronounced, de&s;cribing vnto them, the fickle and dange|rous e&s;tate wherein their Country now &s;toode, by rea&s;on of this &s;udden and vnlooked for alteration of crooked For|tune, with the mutabilitie of the minds of the common peo|ple, who&s;e natures are alwaies to li&s;ten after nouelties. which things being con&s;idered, it could not chu&s;e but to ap|peare vnpo&s;&s;ible, to k&eacute;epe the Common-wealth in &s;afetie:
<PB REF="13"> without &s;ome certaine forme of gouernment to be e&s;tabli|&s;hed. De&s;iring all of them to bend and ioyne theyr willing minds together, to deui&s;e &s;ome cour&s;e or meanes for the &s;ame, vntill the King might againe be heard of and reco|uered. Which hee thought could by no meanes better be effected, then by a generall &s;earch made by a cho&s;en num|ber of Knights, who &s;hould trauell through all the Domi|nions and kingdoms of Chri&s;tendome, and el&s;e-where, as by them it &s;hould be thought fit and conuenient: of which number, he him&s;elfe God willing intended to be one, who would either finde him out, or end his dayes in the &s;earch.</P>
<P>This his &s;p&eacute;ech was li&s;tned vnto of all, but e&s;peciallie applauded and commended by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> who as then were indifferently recouered of their wounds, which they receiued at the lo&s;&s;e of theyr King: and b&eacute;eing both young and valerous, e&s;peciallie <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> who was then the ab&s;olute be&s;t Knight in all the kingdome of Denmarke, hoped by this meanes not onely to find out their King, if &s;o be he liued, but al&s;o to winne to them&s;elues eternall renowne, by their haughtie d&eacute;edes of Chiualrie, which they hoped to obtaine in &s;trange Coun|tries, where their fortunes &s;hould conduct them. But as for the gouernment of the Common-wealth, in theyr con|ceits, they thought none more fit then Sir <HI>Henault</HI> him|&s;elfe, who b&eacute;eing both &s;age and di&s;cr&eacute;ete, and al&s;o b&eacute;eing as we haue &s;aid before, Lorde Trea&s;urer, &amp; alwaies in great fauour with their late King, had in a maner the whole ma|naging of the affaires of the Kingdome in his owne hands, by which meanes, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, he knew how, better then any other, to continue the &s;ame in the former e&s;tate, which would be farre better then to alter the &s;ame, by any other order of gouernment.</P>
<P>This their opinion was held for currant of many, and con&s;ented vnto by mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, who de|&s;ired no alteration, but thought their former manner of rule to be be&s;t, and without fault.</P>

Euen &s;uch there were in this Coun&s;ell, who not onely for enuie, di&s;liked the choy&s;e which the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> and the re&s;t had made, but al&s;o di&s;liked of the &s;earch which Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had motioned for the &s;&eacute;eking of the King, alleaging that by making &s;uch a que&s;t, they &s;hould not onely di&s;poyle them&s;elues of theyr chiefe Captaines and leaders, but al&s;o leaue theyr Coun|try naked, and ready for euery inua&s;ion of the enemy, when it would be too late to call home tho&s;e for theyr de|fence whom they &s;hould not know where to find. Some a|gaine thought it better to &s;end forth Emba&s;&s;adors into di|uers Nations, thereby hoping to gaine knowledge, what was become of him: thinking that if the Out-lawes had kept him aliue, that then they had &s;old him to &s;ome Prince, who would be content to put him to raun&s;ome. Others held, that to &s;end foorth &s;pyes, which by diligent inquirie might heare of him, would be the be&s;t cour&s;e. Thus diuers men were of diuers minds, &s;itting a long while in coun&s;ell to no end, neither determining any order for the gouern|ment of the Common-wealth, nor meanes to find out their King and Qu&eacute;ene. But at length, by the meanes of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> who de&s;ired change and alteration,
<PB REF="14"> they grew to determine of their gouernment, which &s;hould be in this manner following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they &s;hould chu&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;ufficien&s;t of the No|bilitie, and Laitie of the Realme, the number of &s;ixe-&s;core, out of which number by lot they &s;hould chu&s;e tenne, and of the Clergie thirtie, out of which nu~ber likewi&s;e they &s;hould chu&s;e two by lot, &s;o that of the Nobility there &s;hould be al|waies tenne, and of the Clergie two, which twelue &s;o elec|ted, &s;hould haue the gouernment of the whole kingdom for a y&eacute;ere, and at the y&eacute;eres end, to giue vp an account vnto the other &s;ixe-&s;core and eighteene, of the imployment of the trea&s;ure belonging to the Crowne: and then other twelue to be cho&s;en in the &s;ame manner, for the next yere. And this order and manner of gouernment to be kept inuiolate, vn|till &s;uch time as they &s;hould heare &s;ome certaine newes, ei|ther of the Kings death, or returne. To this they all con|&s;ented, &s;etting thereto their hands &amp; &s;eales, pre&s;ently ma|king choy&s;e of tho&s;e who&s;e happe &s;hould be fir&s;t to gouerne this their new deui&s;ed &s;tate. The Lots b&eacute;eing ca&s;t, the fir&s;t twelue to whom the gouernment lighted, was of the Clergie, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>O|del&s;toe:</HI> and of the Nobilitie, the Duke of <HI>Louenborge,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Newmi&s;ter,</HI> y^e Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> the Count <HI>Her|mes,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Mildorpe,</HI> the County of <HI>Opencade,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Londen,</HI> the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> the Lorde of <HI>New|&s;tat,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Rensborge.</HI> The&s;e twelue, according to former agr&eacute;ement, tooke on them the gouernment of the kingdome, fir&s;t &s;etting all things in quiet within the king|dome, and making diuers lawes and &s;tatutes for the pre|&s;eruation thereof. And then made preparation for the de|fending of the &s;ame, if &s;o be y^t any neighbor Prince &s;hould now in the alteration of their gouernment, make any war or inua&s;ion vppon them, thereby not to be taken vnproui|ded. They therefore fortified diuers Ca&s;tles, and &s;trong Holds vppon the borders of the Kingdome, repairing tho&s;e that were weake, and erecting new where they thought a|ny n&eacute;ede to be, placing garri&s;ons in them all, for y^e defence
<PB REF="14"> thereof. Likewi&s;e they tooke order, for the defence and &s;ure k&eacute;eping of the Country of <HI>Flaunders</HI> in their &s;ubiection, fearing lea&s;t vppon the report of the lo&s;&s;e of the King and Qu&eacute;ene, there might be &s;ome alteration mooued, either by &s;ome neighbour Potentate, or the inhabitants them&s;elues, who at that time were giuen altogether, to de&s;ire change and alteration.</P>
<P>Now among&s;t all the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es wee mu&s;t not forget the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> who&s;e heroicke mindes not being able to bee contained within the confines of Denmarke, mi&s;&s;ing their onely comfort and &s;olace, their noble Prince, who&s;e pre&s;ence was more d&eacute;ere to them, then any thing in the world be|&s;ides: prouided according to their former determinations, to trauell in his que&s;t throughout the whole world, but that they would either find him out, or heare &s;ome certaine newes of him, which being made knowne, to diuers other Lords and Knights, there were to the number of a hun|dred, all of the minde, bent either to find him out, or neuer to returne. Thus euery one in the be&s;t manner they could, made preperation for their iourney, fitting them&s;elues both with armor, and &s;tore of money for their n&eacute;edefull expences in their trauell. And being all in a readines to depart, they deuided them&s;elues, &s;ome into one Country, and &s;ome in|to another, appointing where many times to m&eacute;ete, being in &s;trange Countries, where wee will leaue them, to de|clare what befell to the King and <HI>Martinus,</HI> being in his e|nemies Country, as is before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> was deliuered by <HI>Martinus,</HI> into the the hands of <HI>Griffory,</HI> by whom hee was impri&s;oned, and how <HI>Martinus</HI> by the Duke was afterward put to death.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu haue heard before, how <HI>Martinus</HI> had a|gr&eacute;ed with <HI>Griffory</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> for the deli|uery of the good King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> in recom|pence whereof, he &s;hould haue for tearme of his life, the Cittie of <HI>Han&s;tance,</HI> withall the cu&s;tomes and profits thereof.</P>
<P>The next day after this conclu&s;ion, the Duke going a|long with him to <HI>Han&s;tance,</HI> where being ariued, was by <HI>Martinus</HI> brought into the Burge&s;&s;es hou&s;e, where he left the King, who according to his oath he found there &s;till re|maining, little fearing that which &s;uddenly hapned vnto him, for <HI>Martinus</HI> comming vnto him, and taking him by the hand, as if hee would haue conferred with him about his raun&s;ome, brought him at length into a chamber, whereas he had left the Duke, accompanied with &s;ome few of his nobillitie, vnto whom <HI>Martinus</HI> &s;pake as fol|loweth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t high and mighty Prince, according vnto my faith|full promi&s;e made vnto your excellencie, I h&eacute;ere before the&s;e your nobillity, deliuer vp into your hands, this vn|fortunate and vnhappie King of Denmarke, of whom you may now at any time, be fully and &s;ufficiently reuenged, of any former wrong by him committed again&s;t you, or of any di&s;plea&s;ure, which worthily you haue conceaued a|gain&s;t him, and likewi&s;e &s;o clip his wings, for euer h&eacute;ere|after being able, to doe you the lea&s;t offence what&s;oeuer.</P>
<P>When the Duke had heard him &s;peake this his plea&s;ing, and to him mo&s;t delightfull &s;peech, &s;carce &s;uffring him to make his conclu&s;ion, hauing al&s;o in the meane time throughly viewed the King, whom by diuers &s;ignes he ve|rily knew to be the &s;ame, he could &s;carce content him&s;elfe,
<PB REF="15"> but would immediatly haue &s;laine him with his owne hands, &s;o deadly was the hate he bare him, and &s;uch the in|ciuillitie of his churli&s;h and reuengfull nature: yet being &s;topped by &s;ome of his nobilitie from killing him, hee fell out into the&s;e or &s;uch like rayling &s;peeches. O thou mo&s;t accur&s;ed and vild caitife, whom were it not (that I meane to put th&eacute;e to more extreame paine &amp; torments,) I would with the&s;e my hands, rent that dete&s;table body of thine to peeces, and with my t&eacute;eth teare and gnaw the fle&s;h from thy bones, &s;o endle&s;&s;e is my malice again&s;t th&eacute;e, and &s;o ma|ny thy wrongs and villanies committed, which cau&s;eth me to mu&s;e and inuent, what or how many kind of tor|ments, I might inflict vpon th&eacute;e. But would to God that di&s;loyall &s;trumpet, that infernall Qu&eacute;ene, the cau&s;er of all my mi&s;eries, yea &s;he who&s;e bewitching beauty, thou &s;o much and with &s;uch a gr&eacute;edine&s;&s;e ha&s;t de&s;ired, yea and by thy comurations, and other thy dete&s;table and execrable meanes, thou ha&s;t hetherunto to thy content inioyed: O that &s;he were h&eacute;ere pre&s;ent, to behold and take part of tho&s;e continuall paines and torments, the which not only for the hate I beare th&eacute;e, but al&s;o to bee reuenged on her, for her mo&s;t odious, whori&s;h, and execrable di&s;&s;imulation towards me, I meane to inflict vppon thy wretched carkas.</P>
<P>The good King being no longer able to forbeare, the&s;e inhumane and oprobrious reuilings, proffred him by his curri&s;h and &s;pightfull enemie, replied in this &s;ort: <HI>Griffory</HI> I cannot but mu&s;e, how God hauing indued th&eacute;e, with rea&s;on and vnder&s;tanding like vnto other men, that thou notwith&s;tanding, &s;houlde&s;t abound in vicious, wicked, and dete&s;table conditions aboue all other men, which can&s;t not be content with the mi&s;erie, which thou &s;&eacute;e&s;t me brought into, being thy pri&s;oner, and at thy di&s;po&s;ition, to be either kept or ran&s;omed, wrought by the mo&s;t ba&s;e &amp; odi|ous meanes that might be, yea after &s;uch a &s;ort, that the berie&s;t Infidell vnder the heauens, would not &s;o much as once haue gone about or imagined, but al&s;o now (contra|rie) to all humanitie, reuile&s;t me with &s;uch oprobrious
<PB REF="16"> &s;p&eacute;eches, whom h&eacute;eretofore thou dur&s;t not to looke me in the face for feare, and al&s;o reuile at her, whom neither thy &s;elfe, nor no man liuing is able to touch with y^t lea&s;t crime what&s;oeuer, and that would I make good again&s;t &s;h&eacute;e, and thr&eacute;e of the be&s;t of thy Knights with my body, were I at li|bertie, hauing hor&s;e and armor. Tis true, tis true, replied the Duke, we knowe your vallor to be great, but we will &s;oone abate that your hote courage, and place you where your Godde&s;&s;e whom you &s;o much e&s;t&eacute;eme, &s;hall neither haue power, nor meanes to helpe you.</P>
<P>Doe thy wor&s;t replied the King, and &s;ith it is the will of God to inflict this puni&s;hment vpon me, I will indeuor my &s;elfe with patience, to indure what torments &s;oe|uer &s;hall happen, hoping in the world to come, to inioy therefore eternall ble&s;&s;edne&s;&s;e: but in y^e meane time thinke not thou, but that thou mai&s;t fall in like mi&s;hap, and that I haue yet remaining in the Kingdome of Denmarke &s;uch Subiects, that when they &s;hall knowe of this my ill for|tune and thy crueltie, will not leaue bearing Armes, till &s;uch time they &s;hal haue layd wa&s;t, this thy accur&s;ed Coun|try, not leauing th&eacute;e any Towne, or Fort to hide thy &s;elfe, from their reuengefull &s;words: wherefore adui&s;e thee, and determine either to &s;et me at libertie, or otherwi&s;e expect tho&s;e euils, which will &s;urely fall on thy Country. If thou con&s;ent to my inlargement, for my ran&s;ome thou &s;halt re|ceaue a whole million of gold, which &s;hall bee payed th&eacute;e foorthwith out of my trea&s;urie.</P>
<P>No, no, replied <HI>Griffory,</HI> thy gold is but dro&s;&s;e, and can|not worke in me that content, which my hart &s;hall inioy by thy impri&s;onment, neither doe I feare thy power which thou &s;o much vaunte&s;t of, for thou &s;halt &s;&eacute;e, and that &s;hort|ly, that I will not onely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e my &s;elfe of thy darlings County of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> but al&s;o by the &s;trength of this right arme, in de&s;pight of all thy power, Crowne my &s;elfe King of the Kingdome of <HI>Dan&s;ke,</HI> whil&s;t thou in the meane time, &s;hall lie rotting thy bones in my pri&s;on. The~ turning about to a Knight of his, named Sir <HI>Ragdand,</HI> hee willed
<PB REF="16"> him to conuay the vnhappie King pri&s;oner vnto his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> and there to put him into the dungion of the &s;ayd Ca&s;tle, and to alowe him euery day, for the continu|ance of his mo&s;t wretched life, a quart of water, and a|pound of bread, made of the cour&s;e&s;t branne, thinking this, that continually pining away by rea&s;on of his cour&s;e faire, would be a farre greater paine and torment vnto him, then any pre&s;ent death what&s;oeuer. Likewi&s;e for the more &s;ure keeping of him, hee ordained a gard of fifty Knights, al|waies to bee within the Ca&s;tle, who &s;hould &s;&eacute;e that no Knight &s;hould enter therein. This Ca&s;tle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> was of meruailous &s;trength, inuironed about with d&eacute;epe ditches, and mighty heigh walls, and had but only one way in, which was ouer a drawe bridge, the which was alwaies defended by ten of the &s;ayd fifty Knights, fiue at y^e one end, and fiue at the other, this gard grew at length to a cu&s;tome, by rea&s;on of the hundred Knights of Denmarke, which went in &s;earch of their King, and was deui&s;ed only to in|trap and impri&s;on them, as you may reade towards the latter end of this booke. H&eacute;ere now will we leaue the woful King inclo&s;ed in a mi&s;erable pri&s;on, bewailing his cro&s;&s;e fortune, where hee pa&s;&s;ed away many a yeare, &amp; although his fare was as we haue &s;ayd before both cour&s;e and &s;hort, yet did God &s;o ble&s;&s;e him, that he continued alwaies heal|thy and &s;tronge of body, neuer grieued with any kind of &s;icknes, &s;auing onely di&s;contentedne&s;&s;e of minde, which with patience he much delayed, &amp; returne we to &s;peake of <HI>Martinus,</HI> (who had not long after the impri&s;onment of the King, quietly inioyed the cittie of <HI>Han&s;tance,</HI> withall the profits thereof before granted him, to the extreame griefe of the chiefe&s;t of the Cittie, who di&s;dained much to bee in &s;ubiection to &s;o ba&s;e a per&s;on,) for the Duke, &s;ome eight daies after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion deliuered, fell in con&s;ideration with him&s;elfe, of the great benefit which hee had lo&s;t, by giuing away the chiefe Citty in his Dukedome, deui&s;ed which way he might with his honor recouer the &s;ame againe: at length hauing re&s;olued with him&s;elfe, he brought it thus to
<PB REF="17"> pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>One day b&eacute;eing with diuers of his Nobility, and <HI>Mar|tinus</HI> b&eacute;eing in company, the Duke fained him&s;elfe to be ve|ry merry, and in his mirth, for his further content, de&s;ired <HI>Martinus</HI> to declare, how hee hapned to take <HI>Frederick</HI> pri|&s;oner. <HI>Martinus</HI> not di&s;tru&s;ting any thing, began to make a large repetition, beginning with his former life in France, then the cau&s;e and manner of his bani&s;hment, and their a|riuing in Denmarke, with their robbery and murder, com|mitted in the Forre&s;t of <HI>Maiance,</HI> with their cruell &s;torme &s;u&s;tained at Sea, as is before declared, by which they were put on that Coa&s;t, and la&s;tly, the profer of a hundred thou|&s;and pound by the King, which hee refu&s;ed, onely to plea|&s;ure the Duke. All which when <HI>Griffory</HI> had attentiuelie li&s;tned vnto, h&eacute;e &s;uddenly &s;tart vp from the place where h&eacute;e &s;ate, commaunding the &s;tanders by to lay hands on <HI>Marti|nus,</HI> &s;aying that it was not lawfull to &s;uffer &s;uch a one, who had &s;o many waies de&s;erued death, as by his owne confe&s;|&s;ion did appeare, neither to liue, nor to be accepted into the &s;ocietie of men: wherefore he willed the~ forth-with to leade him to the place of execution. Which when <HI>Martinus</HI> per|ceiued, and &s;aw that the Tyrant was fully minded to exe|cute, what&s;oeuer he had &s;aid, hee fell downe on his knees, de&s;iring mercy, and offering for the &s;afegard of his life, to redeliuer his right of the Citty of <HI>Han&s;tance.</HI> But hee who neuer was acquainted with mercy or compa&s;&s;ion, doubt|ting if he &s;hould pardon him his life, the whole world would condemne him of iniu&s;tice: and &s;&eacute;eing he might as well by his death as his life inioy his will, aun&s;wered, that by the Law hee had de&s;erued to die, and hee b&eacute;eing appointed by God, to be a mini&s;ter of iu&s;tice, could doo no le&s;&s;e then cau&s;e the lawes to be executed: wherefore for an example to all others who for the de&s;ire of this worldly gaine, are content to betray the innocent, hee was ledde to the market place, and had his head &s;mitten of. Now will we returne to &s;peak of the Qu&eacute;ene and her young &s;onne, whom wee left in the Forre&s;t, beeing accompanied with brute bea&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Howe the Queene going into the Forre&s;t, lo&s;t her young &s;onne, for whom &s;hee made great lamentation, and how he was found, and carried away by the Duke of Saxony.</HEAD>
<P>_YOV remember, how the Qu&eacute;ene and her little &s;onne, b&eacute;eing &s;till in the Caue, were nouri&s;hed by &s;uch meate as the Lyon v&s;ed to bring them: and many times for her recreation, would goe walke among&s;t the tr&eacute;es n&eacute;ere adioyning to their Caue. Thus continued &s;h&eacute;e by the &s;pace of one whole y&eacute;ere, neuer &s;&eacute;eing other company then the wilde bea&s;ts: although there were diuers &s;earches made through the Forre&s;t, as well by the Knights that we&s;t in the que&s;t of her and the King, as al&s;o by others for diuers occa&s;ions. It hapned one day that the Lion hauing brought in a young Kidde, which h&eacute;e had ta|ken, the Qu&eacute;ene went forth to breake &s;ome wood to ro&s;t the &s;ame withall: and taking her young &s;onne with her, who by this time was able a little to goe and craule, and &s;etting him downe in the &s;unne whil&s;t &s;he went vp and downe, to breake rotten bowes and &s;ticks for the v&s;e afore&s;aid, think|ing her childe would continue quiet enough, playing with &s;uch toyes as &s;he had left him, went &s;omewhat farre from the place. H&eacute;e in the meane time, either b&eacute;eing wearie of his &s;port, or di&s;liking the place where he was, or more like|ly by the &s;peciall will of God, who pittying his and others mi&s;haps, had otherwi&s;e determined of his bringing vp, cau|&s;ed him to goe from place to place: &s;o that by the time his Mother had prouided her wood, and was come to the place &s;h&eacute;e left him in, he was gone a&s;tray cleane out of hearing. Which when &s;he beheld, and had awhile called and &s;ought after him, not knowing what was become of him, a thou|&s;and imaginations came into her mind: &s;ometimes think|ing &s;ome wilde bea&s;ts had deuoured him, then imagining againe, that the Lyon &s;&eacute;eing him in that place by him&s;elfe,
<PB REF="18"> had carried him to the Caue, as oftentimes hee would be playing with him, and beare him from place to place: and b&eacute;eing a little comforted with this hope, &s;hee ha&s;ted her to the Caue, where likewi&s;e &s;hee was deceiued of her hope, which put her into &s;uch griefe, that not b&eacute;eing able to con|taine her&s;elfe on her f&eacute;ete, &s;h&eacute;e fell into a traunce. Where wee will leaue her awhile, and declare what became of the child. You &s;hall vnder&s;tand, that the very &s;ame day, <HI>Mau|ris</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> pa&s;&s;ing y^e Seas from <HI>England</HI> towards his owne Country, was driuen by force of weather vppon this Coa&s;t, where b&eacute;eing &s;afely arriued, with a few &s;hyps of his Nauie, the re&s;t b&eacute;eing di&s;per&s;t with the &s;torme, and b&eacute;eing weary of the Sea, determined with &s;ome twentie or thirtie Knights, and Gentlemen in his companie, to take &s;ome recreation and pa&s;time in the Forre&s;t, which was hard adioyning vnto y^e &s;ea-&s;ide where his &s;hips then rode, as is declared in the fir&s;t chapter of this Booke. So taking their hor&s;es and Armour, for feare of any danger which might happen, they altogether &s;et foorth into the Forre&s;t, whereas they had not long rode, before &s;uch time as a mer|uailous great Stagge appeared vnto them, which when Duke <HI>Mauris</HI> beheld, with his Launce in his hand, hee &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, willing the re&s;t of his company to fol|low him, hoping by the &s;wiftnes of his hor&s;e to haue &s;laine the Stagge: which hee pur&s;ued &s;o farre, that at length hee had lo&s;t the &s;ight of all his company, and was entred &s;o far in the Forre&s;t, that h&eacute;e knew not well which way to re|turne againe, &s;o thicke were the tr&eacute;es and bu&s;hes, and &s;o many the &s;mall trodden paths which ledde two and fro, made by the wilde bea&s;ts.</P>

<PB REF="18"> and no bodie nere it, hee mu&s;ed from whence it &s;hould come, or by what meanes it might be brought into a place, &s;o de&s;ert and voyd of humane companie: then taking the childe vp in his armes, and earne&s;tly beholding it, hee thought that it did very much re&s;emble his young &s;onne lago, who was then about the age of <HI>18</HI> or <HI>20</HI> monthes old, wherefore after hee had a while called to &s;&eacute;e, whether any body would come to &s;&eacute;eke for the child, and &s;awe that none came, he mounted againe on hor&s;e backe, taking the childe with him, determining to haue him nouri&s;hed &amp; brought vp with his &s;onne, becau&s;e they did &s;o much re&s;emble and were &s;o n&eacute;ere of age, imagining that it might bee &s;ome Gentlemans, or Nobles mans childe, that by &s;ome great mi&s;fortune was brought into this extremitie, thus &s;ome|times mu&s;ing of one matter, and &s;o of another, he rod on|wards he knew not well whether, but by chance he hapned on a &s;mall beaten way, which brought him out of the For|re&s;t, almo&s;t at the &s;ame place where he entred, where h&eacute;e found all his companie in a great feare, and doubt what was become of him, minding to haue returned againe into the Forre&s;t to &s;&eacute;eke for him. But when they &s;awe him com|ming, they were all filled with great ioy, &amp; went to m&eacute;ete him, to whom he recounted all his aduenture, and of the finding of the childe, which when they had heard, and be|held him, they much admired as well his &s;trange finding, as al&s;o the rarene&s;&s;e of his beautie, then which they imagi|ned neuer to haue &s;&eacute;ene any more accompli&s;hed: &s;ome ima|gining this, &s;ome that, and all they knew not what, this pa&s;t they away the time vntill they were come, where their &s;hippes ancored, and going aboord the next day, ha|uing the wind faire, and the &s;eas indifferently calme, they &s;et &s;aile in &s;o happie a houre, that within foure daies after they arriued in the Dutchie of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> at a port called <HI>Le|ton,</HI> from whence they rode towards the Cittie of <HI>Bren|&s;weke,</HI> where then the Dutches was remaining, of whom and the whole Cittie, the Duke was mo&s;t louingly recea|ued, and welcomed home, who pre&s;ently after his comming
<PB REF="19"> to the Pallace, he demaunded for his young &s;onne, who be|ing brought before him, he cau&s;ed likewi&s;e the childe which he found in the Forre&s;t to be brought al&s;o, who being both together, a man might very hardly knowe the one from the other, but that the <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince, was &s;omething the bigger, as being elder by &s;ixe monthes, hand had al&s;o as then &s;omewhat the better cullor, being nori&s;hed with more whol&s;omer diet. After they had a while beheld and played with the children, the Duke declared vnto the Dutches, and re&s;t of the Lords and Ladies there pre&s;ent, the man|ner of his finding, as before is recited, and likewi&s;e willed to haue him brought vp, as acompanion with his &s;onne, de&s;iring the Dutches to bee as carefull of him, as of her owne, a&s;&s;uring her that his minde gaue him, how that the childe was i&s;&s;ued of a Noble bloode: &amp; becau&s;e they knewe not by what name to call him, the Duke willed him to b&eacute;e called the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, which name we mu&s;t v&s;e vntill &s;uch time, as fortune &s;hall make knowne, from whence he is proc&eacute;eded.

<P>Thus at length &s;omewhat comforted with the hope &s;hee had, that the prouidence of the mo&s;t Highe&s;t, might turne

<PB REF="20"> imagin, &s;h&eacute;e &s;ecretlie inquired as well the cau&s;e of this &s;trange alteration, as al&s;o whether there were any certain newes of the Kings being aliue or dead.

<P>_IT is to be remembred before, how the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>He|nault,</HI> with diuers others, taking on them the &s;earch of their King, began their iourney from <HI>Maiance,</HI> re&s;oluing not to returne with out &s;ome certaine newes of him who~ they &s;ought for: thus trauailing on together through mo&s;t part of <HI>Denmark,</HI> they hapned at length co~ming into a Forre&s;t, to m&eacute;et a Squire on hor&s;back, making all the &s;p&eacute;ede that po&s;&s;ibly he might: euer looking backwards, as if &s;ome body had pur&s;ued him. At length, m&eacute;eting with the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the re&s;t of the company, who were in all to the number of twelue Knights, be&s;ides their Squires, and thinking by the co&s;tly Armor which he ware, him to be the chiefe&s;t in the compa|nie, alighted from his hor&s;e, and falling on his kn&eacute;es, with the teares &s;tanding in his eyes, &s;pake as followeth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t curteous Knight, for &s;o much my minde a&s;&s;ureth you to be, I humbly be&s;&eacute;ech you, and the re&s;t of your com|pany heere pre&s;ent, for the honour of knight-hood, and the loue that you ought to beare to all di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ladies and Dam&s;els, that you wil doe &s;o much as &s;uccour and reuenge a mo&s;t beautifull Lady, who euen now in this Forre&s;t b&eacute;e|ing trauailing to a brothers hou&s;e of hers, &s;ome 3. leagues di&s;tance from her owne, b&eacute;eing accompanied with her hu&s;|band, my Lord and Mai&s;ter, and &s;ome foure or fiue atten|dants more, whom I feare mee by this time are all neere|hand &s;laine, or grieuou&s;ly wounded, by a ranck Traytor, who hauing long time &s;ued vnto my Lady for la&s;ciuious loue, and not b&eacute;eing able to maintaine the &s;ame, by rea&s;on of her cha&s;t and hone&s;t denials: this morning, knowing
<PB REF="21"> that &s;he was to pa&s;&s;e this way, accompanied him&s;elfe with &s;ome tenne or twelue, as wickedly di&s;po&s;ed as him&s;elfe, whom hee had made acquainted with his villainous pre|tence, vnawares &s;et vppon vs, &amp; at the fir&s;t incounter grie|uou&s;ly wounded my Lord, by rea&s;on he was vnarmed, ha|uing nothing but his &s;word to defend him&s;elfe, as not dou|ting any &s;uch euill.</P>
<P>Thus concluding his tale with whole floods of teares, which i&s;&s;ued from his &s;orrowfull eyes, which mooued pitty in all the beholders, e&s;pecially in the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> who not long before had ta&s;ted the like mi&s;hap: willing y^e &s;quire to &s;tand vp, and comfort him&s;elfe, a&s;&s;uring him, that he had met with tho&s;e, who would reuenge the wrong which hee had declared vnto them. Wherefore willing him to &s;hewe which way he &s;hould take, he &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, and galloped as fa&s;t as hee could, hoping to come &s;oone enough to their &s;uccour: which when the re&s;t of his companie be|held, they followed after as fa&s;t as they could, but had not rodden long before they had lo&s;t &s;ight of him, by rea&s;on of the thickne&s;&s;e of the wood, and the &s;wiftnes of his hor&s;e, which was accounted to be the be&s;t in all the Kingdome. Thus galloping onwards, at length he came where y^e way deuided it &s;elfe into thr&eacute;e &s;euerall paths, and taking that on the right hand, as thinking it to be the right way, hee rode on &s;till, neuer looking backe for his co~pany, &s;o earne&s;t was his mind, &s;et on the re&s;cue of the Lady and her hu&s;band. The re&s;t comming after, when they came vnto the place where the way deuided it &s;elfe, knew not well what to doe, nor which way to take, yet at length, b&eacute;eing directed by the Squire, the mo&s;t of them, as Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> tooke that way which ledde directly foorth betw&eacute;en the other two, appointing &s;ome to take the other wayes to follow the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> if peraduenture he had mi&s;&s;ed in his way. Among&s;t which his Squire, &amp; two other Knights, the one named Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> the other Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> tooke the way which he before had roden.</P>
<P>The Lorde <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> as wee haue &s;aid before, beeing
<PB REF="22"> pricked on with a de&s;ire to re&s;cue tho&s;e which were di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed, made &s;uch ha&s;t, that after he had pa&s;&s;ed the place where the wayes deuided it &s;elfe, and hauing rodden about two miles from the place, met with a pea&s;ant driuing of cattell before him, of whom he inquired, whether he had &s;&eacute;ene any company thereabouts fighting? or any Knights or gentle|men &s;laine? The pea&s;ant made aun&s;were he &s;aw no &s;uch, but &s;ome halfe a mile before, he met foure Knights cro&s;&s;ing the way towards a little Ca&s;tle, &s;ome two leagues of, lea|ding a very faire Lady pittifully w&eacute;eping, who~ he thought they con&s;trained to goe onwards again&s;t her will. When <HI>Gwaltero</HI> had heard this, he a&s;&s;ured him&s;elfe that this was the &s;ame Lady whom he went to re&s;cue, wherefore deman|ding which way they went, the pea&s;ant &s;hewed him where they were riding vp a little hill, almo&s;t a mile before him, which when he beheld, he &s;purred on fa&s;ter then before h&eacute;e had doone, &s;o that before they were attained vnto the &s;ight of theyr Ca&s;tle, he had ouertaken them in a fayre meddow, betw&eacute;ene two &s;mall hills. And calling to them, &s;ayd, Tray|tors turne, and deliuer me that Lady, whom &s;o villainou&s;ly you haue carried away, or your liues &s;hall pay my &s;worde her raun&s;ome.</P>
<P>They hearing him call, and looking backe, &s;&eacute;eing but one Knight alone per&s;uing them, &s;tayed, and he who ledde the Ladies hor&s;e by the raines, being a very bigge and comly Knight, an&s;wered: fooli&s;h and mo&s;t &s;imple Knight, thinke&s;t thou me &s;o fond or faint harted, that only at thy threats, who art able to performe nothing but in words, I will de|liuer this my prize whom I haue gotten &s;o hardly, and with the price of much bloud, or that my loue towards her is &s;o &s;mall, &s;o lightly to part from her. No, no, I coun&s;ell th&eacute;e rather for thy owne &s;afegard to depart away, or el&s;e this my Launce &s;hall make your pa&s;&s;e-port to old <HI>Caron. Gwaltero</HI> hearing this, and being no longer able to indure tho&s;e braues, placed his Launce in his re&s;t, and &s;etting &s;purres to his hor&s;e, they ranne together like lightning, and at the encounter their &s;peares &s;lew into y^e aire, <HI>Gwal|tero</HI>
<PB REF="22"> pa&s;&s;ing on without any hurt at all, but the other Knight who&s;e name was <HI>Brandoll,</HI> being wounded a little in the left &s;ide, was &s;o &s;ore a&s;tonied with the &s;troke, that he could hardly containe him&s;elfe, from falling from his hor&s;e: which <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing, his carreare ended, re|turned againe with his &s;word in his hand, then m&eacute;eting the one the other, there beganne a fierce and doubtfull com|bat, which had foorthwith ended by a &s;troke that the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> gaue him on the right &s;houlder, which was &s;o mighty, that breaking his pouldron, wounded him &s;hrewdly in the &s;houlder, and &s;liding downe farther, cut him into the thigh, with paine whereof h&eacute;e fell from his hor&s;e: which when the re&s;t of his companie beheld, all at once they a&s;&s;ailed him, charging him &s;o roughly, that h&eacute;e was likely to haue gone be&s;ides his Saddle, had he not ta|ken hold on the hor&s;e maine with his hands, but they had no great cau&s;e long to boa&s;t thereof, for gathering all his forces together, and ray&s;ing him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrup, h&eacute;e tooke one of them &s;o &s;ound a blow on the Helme, that the &s;t&eacute;ele not able to k&eacute;epe out the &s;troke, claue his head to the t&eacute;eth, to the great di&s;comfort of the re&s;t. Who &s;&eacute;eing one of their companie &s;laine, and their Captaine lying on the ground, in little better &s;ort, determined either to b&eacute;e reuen|ged, or el&s;e to followe them in the like mi&s;fortune: raging &amp; chafing, y^e one only Knight &s;hould be able to make re&s;i&s;ta~ce again&s;t them: a&s;&s;aulted him more fiercely then they had done before. One of them who&s;e Launce remained whole, determined to charge him on the backe, and comming be|hind him with his full carreare, at &s;uch a time as he was rai&s;ing him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrups, to haue &s;triken one that was before him, gaue him &s;uch a cruell &s;troke, that cau&s;ed him tumble headlong ouer his hor&s;e necke, and had not his Armor beene exc&eacute;eding good, that blowe had made an end of the combat: but hee who was re&s;erued for other pur|po&s;es, f&eacute;eling him&s;elfe &s;o cowardly &s;triken, quickly recoue|red his f&eacute;ete, and defended him&s;elfe valiently, though with more di&s;aduantage then before, whereby he receaued
<PB REF="23"> many wounds, and was likely to haue b&eacute;ene ouercome, for by this time <HI>Brandoll</HI> had againe recouered his &s;cences, and &s;&eacute;eing the Knight who had brought him into that ca&s;e, to continue &s;till fighting, again&s;t his Knights, and had al|ready &s;laine one of them, being vrged forwards, both with &s;hame and griefe, taking his &s;word in his hand, h&eacute;e ranne vpon him like a fierce vn&s;kilfull ma&s;tiue, who being once to&s;&s;ed by the &s;turdie bull, commeth on more ha&s;tily then before: but <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing him comming, &s;&eacute;eming to m&eacute;ete him lightly, made a thru&s;t at one of the Knights hor&s;es, which charged him on hor&s;e-backe, which thru&s;t lighted &s;o luckily, that &s;o piercing his belly, hee cau&s;ed him with his Mai&s;ter to tumble to the ground, where by rea&s;on of one of his f&eacute;ete being in the &s;tirrup, he could not &s;o &s;ud|denly ri&s;e againe, by which meanes <HI>Gwaltero</HI> the more na&s;ier delt with <HI>Brandoll,</HI> and the other Knight, who &s;&eacute;eing his fellowes mi&s;chance, di&s;mounted him&s;elfe for feare of the like mi&s;hap: now grew the foote combat more hote and fierce then that on hor&s;e-backe, by rea&s;on that <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing him&s;elfe almo&s;t wearied, and fearing the com|ming of the other Knight, who&s;e foote was in the &s;tirrup vnder his hor&s;e, layd on with al his might, but <HI>Brandoll</HI> be|ing a &s;trong Knight as mo&s;t in that Country, &s;&eacute;emed to &s;et light by his furie, and charged him againe with &s;o ma|ny mighty blowes, as well hee gaue him to vnder&s;tand, that he knew better how to fight on foote, then on hor&s;e-backe.</P>
<P>The good Lady in the meane time &s;ate w&eacute;eping on her palfrie, being held by two of <HI>Brandolls</HI> Squiers, euer praying and be&s;eeching God, to pre&s;erue and defend the &s;trange Knight, who&s;e vertue and prowe&s;&s;e &s;he much ad|mired, and whom &s;he feared was not long able to indure the brunt of the battaile, for that the other Knight hauing recouered him&s;elfe from vnder his hor&s;e, came likewi&s;e to to the combat, to her great griefe and &s;orrowe. But ca&s;ting away her head from the &s;ight of the battaile, as loth to &s;&eacute;e the death of him, who had &s;o valiantly fought in her de|fence,

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Gwalteros</HI> Squire came to his re&s;cue, and how they conducted the Lady to her Ca&s;tle.</HEAD>
<P>_SIR <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus</HI> the two Knights, which tooke the way after the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> accompanied with his Squire, thinking becau&s;e he had taken the wrong way, that hee &s;hould haue had no occa&s;ion of fighting, made the le&s;&s;er &s;p&eacute;ede after him, vntil &s;uch time, that comming vnto the top of the hill which he had pa&s;&s;ed, where the pea&s;ant &s;howed him the foure Knights that ledde away the Lady, from which place they beheld them fighting, and thinking that it might be <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> they &s;et &s;purres to their hor&s;es, and galloped &s;o fa&s;t, that they were come within the calling, euen as the Knight who was hanging by the &s;tirrupe had recouered him&s;elfe. Then Sir <HI>Cadrus</HI> cryed to the &s;ayd villaines, giue ouer fighting with that alone Knight, and defend your &s;elues from the force of my Launce, and there with gaue one of them &s;o &s;ound a buffet, that he had no n&eacute;ede at all to &s;&eacute;eke for a Surgion, for his Launce entring in at his bre&s;t, pa&s;&s;ed through his hart almo&s;t a yeard. Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> ranne at the other and mi&s;&s;ed cour&s;e, but turning againe with his &s;word in his hand, gaue him &s;uch a blowe on the head, that cleauing his Helme, and wounding him &s;ome|what d&eacute;epe, cau&s;ed him halfe a&s;tonied to fall to the ground. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> &s;&eacute;eing this vnexpected ayde, b&eacute;eing almo&s;t be|fore in vtter di&s;payre of victory, gaue <HI>Brandoll</HI> a &s;ore blow on the right legge, and clo&s;ing with him, by cleane force o|uerthrew him to the ground, then &s;etting his foote on his
<PB REF="24"> necke, he ra&s;ed of his Helme, and with one blow parted his head from his &s;houlders. And comming to the other whom Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> had wounded, would haue doone as much for him, but that hee immediatly fell on his kn&eacute;es, crying for mercy, prote&s;ting for euer after to be at his commaund in all places what&s;oeuer. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> vppon this his promi&s;e, granted him pardon, &s;wearing him for euer after, not to of|fer wrong nor violence, to any Lady or Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>Then turning to Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> hee gaue them hartie thanks for their &s;uccour, without which he had b&eacute;ene doubtle&s;&s;e &s;laine. Demaunding of them likewi&s;e, what was become of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> &s;ir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the re&s;t. And they told him how they parted at the 3. waies, to goe &s;uccour the Lady whom hee had &s;o well re&s;cued, tel|ling him likewi&s;e, that they did admire how or by what meanes the Lady was brought thether, &s;eeing it was in the other way that ledde directly forward that they &s;et on her and her hu&s;band, as the Squire informed them.</P>
<P>By this time the Lady being let goe by the two Squiers that held her, (who &s;&eacute;eing their Mai&s;ter &s;laine, made ha&s;t by flight to &s;aue their owne liues, which they might ea&s;ily doe, for that no man pur&s;ued them,) came vnto the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and falling on her kn&eacute;es before him, gaue him mo&s;t humble thankes, as well for the &s;afegard of her owne honor, which &s;h&eacute;e e&s;t&eacute;emed farre afore life, as al&s;o for re|uenging her hu&s;bands death: whom <HI>Brandoll</HI> in the for|mer fight had &s;laine, with &s;ome two or thr&eacute;e of their &s;er|uaunts, who put them&s;elues in their defence, with all, of|fering him many large proffers for reward. But <HI>Gwaltero</HI> taking her by the hand, rai&s;ed her from the ground, wil|ling her to be of good comfort, a&s;&s;uring her what&s;oeuer h&eacute;e had doone for her, was but his, and the dutie of euery good Knight, and therefore willed her to attribute it, not to him but to God, who is the reuenger of all wrongs: and to ac|count of him but as an in&s;trument, appointed by God to mini&s;ter iu&s;tice on tho&s;e murderers. Then the Ladie en|treated him and the re&s;t, to conduct her vnto a Ca&s;tle of
<PB REF="24"> hers, &s;ome two leagues of, where &s;he would intreate them to re&s;t them&s;elues, vntill &s;uch time as his woundes were throughly cured, which &s;hould be doone by a dam&s;ell of hers, very expert in the Art of Surgery. Vnto which re|que&s;t, they ea&s;ily con&s;ented, e&s;pecially the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> who&s;e hart was already wounded with the Ladies beutie. Then binding vp his wounds as well as they could, they mounted on hor&s;ebacke, directing their cour&s;e towards the fore&s;aid Ca&s;tle, &amp; the better to pa&s;&s;e away the time, <HI>Gwal|tero</HI> beganne to que&s;tion with the Lady of many matters, e&s;pecially of the cau&s;e of the late combat, which &s;hee decla|red vnto him, with &s;uch a mode&s;t and comlie grace, that h&eacute;e b&eacute;eing before a little wounded with <HI>Cupids</HI> &s;haft, was now &s;o altogether ouercome with loue, that either he mu&s;t n&eacute;edes &s;ue for grace, or die by concealing his affection: &s;o feruent was the flame, and &s;o weake his re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>By this time were they pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t part of theyr way, and were come vnto the Ca&s;tle, euen about the time, that the Sunne drawing into the We&s;t, &s;&eacute;emed to take leaue of the view of the&s;e hether Regions, where by the Lady they were mo&s;t kindly receiued: and welcommed with &s;uch ch&eacute;ere, as the &s;uddennes of the time could affoord. After Supper, the Lorde <HI>Gwaltero</HI> b&eacute;eing brought into a mo&s;t goodly and fayre Chamber, had his wounds carefully loo|ked vnto, and dre&s;&s;ed. Then beeing layd in a ritch bedde, imbrodred very co&s;tly with gold and pearle, and curiou&s;ly wrought with imagry, and other &s;umptuous &s;hewes, where beeing layd, the good Lady curteou&s;ly bad him good night, willing him to commaund for all things in the Ca|&s;tle as his owne. Then departing away, leauing him in a world of imaginations, &s;h&eacute;e tooke order for the interring of her Hu&s;bands bodie, which the next day was effected with great &s;olemnitie, according to the cu&s;tome of the coun|try then v&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Howe <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> with his company, &s;taying the healing of his wounds, made his loue knowne to the Lady, with his &s;ucce&s;&s;e therein, and of his departure in his que&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> and his company, &s;tay|ing the curing of his wounds, which were mo&s;t carefully looked vnto, and dre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame Dam&s;ell which had them in cure, was euery day vi&s;ited continually by y^e La|die of the place, who &s;hewed her&s;elfe &s;o thankfull vnto him, that &s;he almo&s;t neuer would depart fro~ his pre&s;ence, which bred in him &s;uch ardent de&s;ire, that not b&eacute;eing able longer to conceale his loue, one day &s;h&eacute;e b&eacute;eing &s;itting by his bed|&s;ide, none b&eacute;eing in pre&s;ence, but his Squire, and the dam|&s;ell that attended his wounds, taking her by the hand, and fixing his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on her face, &s;aid.</P>
<P>Gracious Lady, I doe not knowe, nether can I imma|gine, how the&s;e my &s;peeches, which at this time I &s;hall b&eacute;e forced to vetter, may be by you accepted, yet tru&s;ting in the gentlene&s;&s;e of your kind nature, haue made choi&s;e ra|ther to open my griefe vnto you, then by concealing there|of, or euer to langui&s;h in paine. Know then, that &s;ince the fir&s;t time it was my hap (when I fought with <HI>Brandoll</HI> and his companie) for to &s;ee you, that then your rare and &s;ingular beauty, wounded me more farre deeper, then did either their &s;words or Launces, which &s;ince by your con|tinuall courti&s;ies, and by your many exqui&s;ite vertues, which I haue behold in you, are &s;o much augmented and increa&s;ed, that vnle&s;&s;e you of your excellent bounty, take pitty and compa&s;&s;ion on me, and with &s;p&eacute;ede yeeld &s;ome reliefe, vnto this my oppre&s;&s;ed pa&s;&s;ions, I knowe not what to expect &s;aue death onely, which if you &s;hould prooue pit|tile&s;&s;e, it would be mo&s;t welcome vnto me: wherefore let me intreate you, to con&s;ider the&s;e my pa&s;&s;ions, and to ea&s;e them with pitty, and thereby &s;hall you gaine vnto your
<PB REF="25"> &s;elfe for euer, a true Knight, and a con&s;tant louer. Thus concluding his &s;peech with a mo&s;t d&eacute;epe &s;igh, proc&eacute;eding from the bottome of his hart, he remained &s;ilent, attending her an&s;were, which &s;hould be to him either as life or death, to which &s;he replied.</P>
<P>My Lord, I ca~not but mu&s;e at this your di&s;cour&s;e, neither can I chu&s;e but &s;mile, to &s;&eacute;e your honor &s;o merrily di&s;po&s;ed, to ie&s;t at me in this kind of &s;ort, hoping that mirth is a &s;igne of y^e amendment of your wounds, which to me would bee mo&s;t ioyfull, &s;&eacute;eing that in my defence you receaued them. But if the&s;e your &s;p&eacute;eches proc&eacute;ede from you in ear|ne&s;t, knowe then, that the beauty which you &s;ay hath in|flamed you, in my conceit is of no &s;uch force, as to wound a man of your worth, neither is it likely that &s;o &s;udden a liking as you &s;peake of, &s;hould bee able to work any &s;uch effect, if my curte&s;ies haue b&eacute;ene the cau&s;e, they were neuer more then you de&s;erued, and therefore to be e&s;t&eacute;emed by you as a debt due from mee to be payd: if my vertues which you &s;peake of, they alas are &s;o fewe, and &s;mall, that they are not to be accounted of, but yet &s;uch I hope, which ra|ther &s;hould giue you an occa&s;ion, to &s;&eacute;eke to others, then any &s;how to yeild vnto your lawle&s;&s;e loue: for know for a &s;uerty y^t <HI>Menea,</HI> for &s;o was &s;he called, regardeth more her honor &amp; good name, then &s;he doth all the riches or wealth of this world, knowing the one to be but momentarie, the other perpetuall: wherefore I be&s;&eacute;ech your honor to giue of the&s;e vaine &s;utes. But if you &s;&eacute;eke to inioy me as your wife, which I thinke you will take &s;corne of, I being but a poore Lady, and de&s;cended but of a meane Parentage, in re&s;pect of your Lord&s;hip, yet notwith&s;tanding con&s;ider I be&s;&eacute;ech you, the late death of my hu&s;band, whom if I &s;hould &s;o &s;oone forget, it would for euer be accounted a great ignomie, and &s;hame vnto me.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> at the&s;e la&s;t &s;p&eacute;eches interrupting her, replied, mo&s;t beautifull Lady, thinke not that I goe a|bout any way to di&s;honor you, neither that tho&s;e my for|mer &s;peeches to be fained, but what&s;oeuer I haue &s;poken
<PB REF="26"> to proc&eacute;ede from the &s;inceritie, and bottome of my harf, which is, and for euer &s;hall remaine yours, whil&s;t the fates &s;hall permit me to inioy this breath, which I wi&s;h no lon|ger to continue, then I remaine your faithfull and con&s;tant Knight prote&s;ting before the almighty God: neuer to ac|cept of any other wife, &s;o you thereto con&s;ent, in witne&s;&s;e whereof, I h&eacute;ere deliuer you this ring: then taking a faire Diamond from one of his fingers, he would haue put it on hers, but &s;he withdrawing her hand, made him an&s;were, that &s;hee had made a &s;olemne vowe to God, which &s;h&eacute;e was minded to performe, which was, that for one whole yeare, &s;hee would neuer con&s;ent to marry with any one what&s;oeuer, but if it plea&s;ed his Lord&s;hip, &s;o to e&s;t&eacute;eme of her, as to accept her for his wife, at the end of that appoin|ted time which &s;he had &s;et: he &s;hould find her mo&s;t ready &amp; willing to obey vnto his will, in any that might not b&eacute;e to her di&s;honor.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> gladded to the hart, with this heauenly conclu|&s;ion, and beeing as one newly reuiued out of &s;ome dead traunce, tooke her in his armes and ki&s;&s;ed her, prote&s;ting that he would mo&s;t willingly remaine &s;o contented, vntill the fixed time were expired, and then God willing, he would returne and e&s;pou&s;e her: in y^e meane time he intreated her, to accept of that his &s;mall Ring, which &s;hould be a cau&s;e for her to remember him by, which &s;he then mo&s;t willingly ac|cepted, and in requitall thereof, gaue vnto him a Iewell of hers, which hee alwaies after either in Tilt or Turnie wore, being fa&s;tned in the cre&s;t of his Helme, and which at all times put him in minde of his Lady and Mi&s;tris. Thus by the comming in of Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> and Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> with diuers Gentlemen and Dam&s;els, which came to &s;&eacute;e the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> their loue talke gaue ouer for that time, entertaining the others with diuers plea&s;ant and merrie di&s;cour&s;es, wherewith they accu&s;tomed to pa&s;&s;e a|way the time, euer thinking it long till they might be in their former que&s;t, which was the &s;ooner, for that <HI>Gwaltero</HI> being comforted, with the hope of future plea&s;ure and con|tent,
<PB REF="26"> was healed much the &s;ooner of his wounds, &s;o that within fift&eacute;ene daies, hee was able to beare Armor: and finding him&s;elfe indifferent &s;trong, tooke order with the re&s;t of his companie, the next day to depart onwards, on their way towards the confines of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> where they hoped to haue &s;ome ioyfull tidings of him whom they &s;ought, or at lea&s;t waies to m&eacute;ete againe with the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> whom the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> d&eacute;erely loued. Thus ha|uing taken order for the preparing of their iourny, the next day they all tooke their leaue of their kind ho&s;tis: and <HI>Gwaltero</HI> taking her a&s;ide, de&s;ired her with the teares &s;tan|ding in his eyes, to be mindefull of her former promi&s;e, a&s;|&s;uring her, if God did grant him life and liberty, hee would returne again&s;t the fixed time by her appointed, to &s;olem|nize their marriage, in the meane time he would commend her into the protection of the almighty God. But &s;he good Lady, not being able to &s;peake for w&eacute;eping, held him about the necke, often ki&s;&s;ing him, as one loth &s;o &s;oone to forgoe his companie, yet at the la&s;t, &s;&eacute;eing no remedie, intreated him to remember her and his promi&s;e, vntill which time of his returne, &s;he would &s;pend her daies in prayer, for his &s;afe and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e. Thus departed the&s;e two Lo|uers, whom we will leaue for a while, to &s;peake of other matters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. How the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> hapned to arriue in the Cittie of <HI>Parris,</HI> &amp; of the Turnie there proclaimed by the Duke of <HI>Orleance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> ta|king the direct way which they were infor|med, to re&s;cue the Lady, and her hu&s;band, rode on a great pace, till &s;uch time that com|ming vnto the place, where the battaile had b&eacute;ene fought but a little before, found y^e dead bodies of the auncient Knight, and diuers of his &s;er|uants:
<PB REF="27"> but for the murtherers, they could not knowe what was become of them, becau&s;e they had taken a bie and vn|knowne way, which ledde them as before is &s;ayd, vnto their de&s;truction. Wherefore taking their way towards the next Towne, they rode on ha&s;tily, minding to &s;tay there vntill they might heare &s;ome newes of the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> whom they imagined would likewi&s;e arriue there, the next day at the farthe&s;t. But h&eacute;ereof being de|ceaued by rea&s;on of the occa&s;ions before recited, after they had remained there &s;ome thr&eacute;e daies looking for him, they departed towards the Sea-&s;ide, and comming to a Towne called <HI>Forefront,</HI> they found diuers Ships bound to &s;eueral coa&s;ts, wherfore deuiding their &s;elues, &s;ome to one Coun|try, &s;ome into another, the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> being loth to part companie, &s;hipped the~&s;elues for <HI>Fraunce,</HI> hoping there either to find him whom they &s;ought for, or el&s;e to purcha&s;e fame by their prowe&s;&s;e within that King|dome: and &s;ooner then in any other might it be obtained, if they &s;howed them&s;elues valerous, by rea&s;on of y^e continual turnaments, which were dayly v&s;ed there by the Nobles, and Knights of tha region. And being &s;hipped, and hauing wind at will, they &s;et &s;aile &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, y^t within eight daies after they landed at <HI>Calice:</HI> where they a while &s;tay|ed, as well to refre&s;h them&s;elues after their comming from the Sea, as al&s;o to view the Towne and Country therea|bouts, and to make inquirie, if peraduenture they might heare of him, in who&s;e Que&s;t they went.</P>
<P>Thus hauing &s;tayd there twelue or fourt&eacute;ene daies, not learning any newes at all of their infortunate King, they tooke their way towards the royall Cittie of <HI>Paris,</HI> where the King then kept his Court, with a great a&s;&s;emblie of Lords and Ladies, which were then drawne together to behold a great Turny, proclaimed by the Duke of <HI>Orle|ance,</HI> by the Kings con&s;ent, again&s;t all &s;trangers: the occa|&s;ion of which Turny grew by this meanes. The Duke b&eacute;eing a lu&s;tie young Knight, was inamoured on y^e Kings elde&s;t daughter, a mo&s;t beautifull and goodly Lady, who
<PB REF="27"> for her grace, vertues, and beautie, had not her equall in all the kingdome of Fraunce, beeing called <HI>Emilia,</HI> who&s;e perfections had &s;o intangled his hart, that hee could not by any meanes fr&eacute;e him&s;elfe from b&eacute;eing thrall to her beautie: and thinking no meanes better to winne a fayre Lady, then by &s;hewing him&s;elfe valiant, hee continually frequented Tylts and Turnyes, oftentimes carrying away the chee|fe&s;t prizes of valour: which was a meanes not onely to ob|taine great loue, and fauour of the King, but al&s;o drew to him &s;ome liking of his Lady and Mi&s;tris, the Princes <HI>E|milia,</HI> which &s;he &s;ometimes would make &s;hewe of, by her kind countenaunce, and plea&s;ant &s;p&eacute;eches to him: which curte&s;ies put him in &s;uch an exc&eacute;eding hope, and pride with|all, that thinking him&s;elfe halfe &s;ure of her loue, and that b&eacute;eing gra&s;t with the &s;ame, no man was able to compare with him, neither in happines nor valour: one day percei|uing the King to be walking alone, in a plea&s;ant &amp; delight|full Garden, adioyning to the Pallace, came vnto him, and falling into &s;ome conference with him, at la&s;t intreated his Maie&s;tie to grant him leaue to proclaime a Turny, which hee, and &s;ome certaine number of Knights of the Court, would defend again&s;t all commers, for the &s;pace of 3 daies. And that after, by the &s;pace of &s;ixe dayes more, h&eacute;e him&s;elfe would k&eacute;epe the field, and defend again&s;t all commers, his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> to excell all others in beau|tie, what&s;oeuer.</P>
<P>The King hearing his demaund, and con&s;idering the great danger which thereby might happen to him, di&s;&s;wa|ded him from it, a&s;&s;uring him, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to continue again&s;t &s;o many, as would hazard them&s;elues in that enterpri&s;e: and that although he by his valor might ouercome many hardie and gallant Knights, yet at length, b&eacute;eing wearie, &amp; tyred with ouermuch labour, might per|aduenture be vanqui&s;hed, by one inferior to tho&s;e whom before he had &s;ubdued, whereby hee &s;hould lo&s;e his former reputation, gotten with no &s;mall perrill and danger. This and many other matters, did the King alleage vnto him,
<PB REF="28"> to cau&s;e him to giue ouer that enterpri&s;e. But hee b&eacute;eing as is before &s;aid, &s;o puffed vp with a &s;elfe conceit, &amp; a&s;&s;urance of Fortunes fauour, imagining that on whom <HI>Venus</HI> &s;mi|led, <HI>Mars</HI> would not &s;&eacute;eme to frowne, continued &s;till verie importiue, till at length, the King b&eacute;eing ouercome by his earne&s;tne&s;&s;e, granted to his &s;ute. Pre&s;ently cau&s;ing He|raults and me&s;&s;engers to be &s;ent abroade into diuers pla|ces, to giue notice thereof: that euery one which de&s;ired to try his fortune in his Loues commendation, might be there to make triall at the day appointed.</P>
<P>In the meane time, the Duke ordained a place for the Tylt-yard, which was hard adioyning to y^e Pallace, which he cau&s;ed to be inuironed in with railes of great height, ap|poynting at each end a large gate or entrance, that tenne Knights on hor&s;ebacke might enter in front. The &s;pace within the rayles, was of that bignes, &s;o that 5000 knights might well turny togethers, &amp; round about were &s;caffolds erected for the beholders to &s;it on, &s;auing that part next to the Pallace, which was open for the King, the Qu&eacute;ene, and their Lord &amp; Ladies, who &s;tanding in the windowes, and battlements of the Pallace, might with more &s;afety behold the Turny. Likewi&s;e he cau&s;ed another place to be inclo|&s;ed, with onely one gate or entrance, hard adioyning to the part of the Pallace, where the King with the re&s;t, might more conuenietly &s;tand, to behold the &s;ingle combats which by him &s;hould be foughten: and at the other end, he cau&s;ed a rich Tent to be pight, which was of Blew veluet, &s;ette thicke with &s;tarres of gold, and Flowre-deluces, &s;hewing that he was de&s;cended from the blood royall. Vpon the top thereof &s;toode <HI>Cupid,</HI> all naked, with his bow and arrowe in his hand, ayming directly at a faire picture of Marble, which &s;toode fa&s;t by the &s;aid Tent: on the top wherof was placed the portrature of the beautifull Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> which was &s;o artificially made, that it &s;&eacute;emed to be the prin|ce&s;&s;e her&s;elfe: vnder who&s;e f&eacute;ete were diuers places made, for placing of their pictures, who&s;e Knights &s;hould be ouer come by the Duke.</P>
<PB REF="28">
<P>In this &s;ort was all things ordained again&s;t the turnie, when the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and diuers other Knights, came into the Cittie, &s;ome two dayes before the Turny began, where they tooke vp their lodging in an ho|ne&s;t Burge&s;&s;es hou&s;e, making preparation for &s;uch things as they &s;hould want again&s;t the day.</P>

The Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> as ch&eacute;efe Challen|ger, accompanied with the Duke of <HI>Aniowe,</HI> the Lorde <HI>Mompen&s;cer,</HI> the Duke <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Normandy,</HI> the Mar|&s;hall <HI>de Berone, Francis</HI> the yong Prince of <HI>Condy,</HI> toge|ther with two thou&s;and other Knights, entred the Li&s;ts at one end, at the other entred <HI>Charles</HI> the young Prince of <HI>Spayne,</HI> accompanied with <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>England,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> the lord <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the County of <HI>Zeland,</HI> the lord <HI>Mongomery,</HI> the young <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> two French lords, who becau&s;e they were not intreated by the Duke, and partly by rea&s;on they meant to prooue them&s;elues again&s;t him, in the behalfe and triall of their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;e beauty, entred the field again&s;t him, with the number of two thou&s;and, taking their places as he before had done.</P>
<P>The King and Qu&eacute;ene b&eacute;eing placed, all the other prin|ces, Lords, and Ladies, tooke al&s;o their places, where <HI>Emilia</HI> &s;itting among&s;t the re&s;t, &s;&eacute;emed like <HI>Cinthia,</HI> placed among&s;t the le&s;&s;er Starres, b&eacute;eing in the fulnes of her po|wer: or like <HI>Diana</HI> following her cha&s;e thorow the woods and launes, acco~panied with her traine of Nimphs, who&s;e
<PB REF="29"> paine in pur&s;ute, had rai&s;ed in her Alabla&s;ter ch&eacute;eks, a liue|ly vermilion die: &s;o &s;&eacute;emed the beautifull Prince&s;&s;e, hauing in her well proportioned face, the louely ro&s;e and lilly, &s;tri|uing for mai&s;terdome, which cau&s;ed the lu&s;tie young Duke to be of &s;uch a couragious mind, that not beeing able lon|ger to de&s;i&s;t from the battaile, de&s;ired the Duke of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> and the County Palatine of <HI>Rene,</HI> who were appointed Iudges of the field, to cau&s;e the &s;ignall of battaile to begin, which was pre&s;ently done, by the &s;ound of a trumpet, and the Heraults crying to the Knights, euery man to doe his be&s;t.</P>
<P>Then ranne together, the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and <HI>Ed|ward</HI> Prince of <HI>England,</HI> and met &s;o fiercely together, that the Duke breaking his Launce on his enemies &s;hield, cau&s;ed him to &s;tagger, and had hee not taken hold by his maine, hee had gone to mea&s;ure his length on the ground, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince met him with no le&s;&s;er might, for piercing his &s;hield, his Launce lighted on his Gorget, cau|&s;ing him to loo&s;e both his &s;tirrups, &amp; with his head almo&s;t to touch the pummel of his &s;addle, which being &s;&eacute;ene by the King, was greatly commended: the Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Normandie</HI> met likewi&s;e, and brea|king their &s;peares, pa&s;t on without once moouing on the o|ther, the Mar&s;hall of <HI>Berone,</HI> was di&s;mounted by the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> but re&s;cued by the Duke of <HI>Aniow</HI> and others. By this time were the greate&s;t part of the Knights met to|gether, &s;o that the cloudes &s;&eacute;emed to be couered, with the &s;plinters of the Launces which were broken many on both &s;ides were vnhor&s;ed, and againe remounted by their fel|lowes, there might you haue &s;&eacute;ene &s;ome v&s;ing &s;words, o|ther maces of Iron: twi&s;e that day was y^e Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> beaten from his hor&s;e, and againe remounted by the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon.</HI> The Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> this day &s;howed, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were not much inferriour vnto any Nation for feats of Chiualrie, for beeing acompanied with the Lord <HI>Montgomerie,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Zeland,</HI> and &s;ome tenne or twelfe
<PB REF="29"> other Knights, beate downe all tho&s;e which put them&s;elues again&s;t them, which being &s;&eacute;ene to the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> was wor&s;e the~ death, who being held very &s;hort by Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mowbray</HI> and others, &s;o that he could hardly helpe any others, yet &s;&eacute;eing the hauocke which was made by the <HI>Scot</HI> and his companie, fearing lea&s;t they were preuented, he &s;hould loo&s;e the day: &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, and with his &s;word in his hand made &s;uch way, that at la&s;t he came where they were, and lifting vp his &s;word, gaue y^e <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Earle &s;uch a blow, that bru&s;ing his Helme, cau&s;ed him to fall be&s;ides his &s;addle, which blow beeing &s;&eacute;ene by Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> was likewi&s;e partly reuenged: for with one blow which he &s;trake, hee cleft the Dukes &s;hield, and &s;liding downewards, wounded his hor&s;e in the &s;houl|der. In the meane time the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prin|ces with their companie, were like to haue wonne the day, for that y^e <HI>French,</HI> no longer able to indure their extreame blowes, began for to turne their backes: which being per|ceaued by the Iudges, they foorthwith cau&s;ed the retreate to be &s;ounded, thereby to &s;aue the Challengers from &s;hame. Then departed euery man the Li&s;ts for that night, retur|ning to their lodgings, to refre&s;h them&s;elues again&s;t the next day: the King to &s;howe the more honor vnto y^e &s;trange Princes, &s;ent for them, de&s;iring them for that night, to &s;up and re&s;t them&s;elues in his Pallace: vnto which many of them co~&s;ented, where at &s;upper they were roially fea&s;ted, and welcomed by the King and Qu&eacute;ene. And after the Ta|bles being with-drawne, they fell to dauncing, ma&s;king, and courting of the Ladies and dam&s;els: where the young Prince <HI>Edward</HI> dallying with the fire, was &s;corched by the flame, for taking the Princes <HI>Emilia</HI> by the hand to daunce, after they had ended their mea&s;ure, fell to court her with plea&s;ant &s;p&eacute;eches, which &s;hee &s;till mo&s;t wittily an&s;wered, which <HI>Cupid</HI> beholding, wounded his hart with a poi&s;oned &s;haft of loue, turning his ie&s;t into earne&s;t: thus pa&s;t they a|way mo&s;t part of the night in dauncing and reuelling, vn|till &s;uch time, that <HI>Ioue</HI> his eternall lampes, wherewith hee
<PB REF="30"> lights the nether world were halfe &s;pent, and <HI>Atlas</HI> moi&s;t daughters &s;troue into the Ocean d&eacute;ep, to driue their weary droue: then departed the&s;e to their beds, where euery one quietly tooke their re&s;t, except the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, who of all the night could not inioy any &s;l&eacute;epe, &s;o &s;orely did the re|membrance of his new loue torment him, &s;ometimes deter|mining to a&s;ke her of her Father, then thinking the Duke to haue a former promi&s;e of her, &s;&eacute;eing hee vnder|tooke the defence of her beauty, was minded to fight with him for her, hoping either to kill him, and &s;o to get her, or el&s;e by vanqui&s;hing him, to winne away her loue. With the&s;e and many &s;uch like imaginations, pa&s;t he away the weari&s;ome night, vntill about the breake of the day, <HI>Som|nus</HI> &s;ea&s;ed on his ouer-watched eies: &s;o that he &s;lept vntill the &s;unne was two degr&eacute;es from the earth a&s;cended, then ri&s;ing vp hee apparrelled him&s;elfe, and went downe into the great Hall, where he found the King, withall the other Princes and great e&s;tates, ready to goe to the Chappell, to heare diuine &s;eruice: whether likewi&s;e hee accompaned them, afterwards returning to the Pallace, they found the Tables couered for dinner, where they were all &s;erued ac|cording to their e&s;tates, with mo&s;t co&s;tly and daintie cates. Dinner being ended, euery one went to arme them&s;elues for the Turnie: where the &s;trangers bare them&s;elues &s;o valiently, that they wonne the honor from the Courtiers, which was &s;uch an extreame griefe vnto the Duke of <HI>Or|leance,</HI> that for that night hee would not come to the Pal|lace, vowing the next day to be reuenged, e&s;pecially on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince and his companie, who twi&s;e that day had beaten him from his hor&s;e. Mo&s;t part of the re&s;t &s;pent the time, as they did the night before in dauncing, and &s;uch like pa&s;time, where againe the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, found meanes to Court his Ladie, declaring vnto her his loue &amp; affection: but &s;he, who as yet was another waies minded, made &s;mall account of his prattle, &s;carce belieuing any thing that he &s;ayd touching loue. The next day the trum|pets &s;ounding, warned the Knights to prepare for the
<PB REF="30"> Turnie, euery one de&s;irous to &s;howe him&s;elfe valiant and hardy: when entring the Li&s;ts at the fir&s;t encounter, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince &s;&eacute;eing the cheefe Challenger comming a|gain&s;t him, and looking vp to the window where <HI>Emilia</HI> &s;ate, calling to minde his former determinations, was re|&s;olued to doe him the greate&s;t di&s;grace he might: the Duke on the other &s;ide was of the &s;ame opinion, for hee greatly feared lea&s;t the Prince would prooue his coriuall in loue, by the ofen ca&s;ting vp of his head to the window where &s;h&eacute;e &s;ate. Thus being both re&s;olued, they met together &s;o furi|ou&s;ly, that the Duke was forced to forgoe his &s;addle, and mea&s;ure his length on the gra&s;&s;e, the Prince pa&s;&s;ing for|wards &s;orely &s;haken, hauing lo&s;t both his &s;tirrups: at length recouering him&s;elfe, entred the prea&s;e, where on all &s;ides he beate downe Knights, and vnbarred Helmes, making &s;uch way where he went, that he might ea&s;ily be followed of his companie, e&s;pecially the Prince <HI>Charles, Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> and others, who fol|lowing the young Prince, ouerthrew all they met, cau|&s;ing the French to giue backe and retire, euery man thin|king him&s;elfe happie&s;t, when he was farthe&s;t of.</P>
<P>On the contrarie &s;ide, <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Normandie,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Condie,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Aniow,</HI> and the Mar&s;hall: with the aide of their followers, made that part where they were very hote and dangerous to the &s;trangers, vnhor&s;&s;ing and beating downe many. The Duke of <HI>Aniow,</HI> with his Launce before he brake, &s;trake downe thr&eacute;e Knights to the earth, at la&s;t, being incountred by the Lord <HI>Dougla&s;&s;e,</HI> was di&s;mounted and taken pri&s;oner, in di&s;pight of all his company. The Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> being againe remoun|ted, went raging vp and downe &s;&eacute;eking for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, and comming to the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> gaue him &s;uch a blow, that hee draue both hor&s;e and man to the ground, which being &s;&eacute;ene by Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> like a man in|raged rod to him, and gaue him &s;uch a blow, that he cau|&s;ed him to bow his head to his bre&s;t. But the Duke reco|uering
<PB REF="31"> him&s;elfe, returned him the like payment. Thus con|tinued they two, laying the one on the other, like two Smithes, &s;triking with their &s;leadges on an Anuill: till &s;uch time as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, with a mace of &s;t&eacute;ele in his hand returned, &amp; gaue the Duke &s;o pui&s;&s;ant a blow there|with, that breaking his &s;hield in p&eacute;eces, &s;o ama&s;ed him, that his hor&s;e carried him from place to place in a &s;ound, which being &s;&eacute;ene by the King, and thinking the Duke to be &s;ore hurt: imagined likewi&s;e that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any man to indure tho&s;e mighty blowes, which he continually &s;aw the Prince to giue, cau&s;ed the Iudges to make an end of the battaile, which was pre&s;ently doone, euery one attri|buting the ch&eacute;efe honor to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, e&s;pecially the King, cau&s;ing foorthwith a Herault of Armes to pro|claime him, the cheefe&s;t Knight in the a&s;embly: and being brought to the windowe where y^e King &s;aie, by the Iudges of the field, had a Garland of flowers &s;et vpon his head by the faire <HI>Emilia.</HI> Which as &s;he was doing, vnawares was &s;omething touched with loue towards him, which being by her then &s;uffred to kindle, afterwards grew into a great flame. Thus being crowned as King of all Knights, h&eacute;e was conducted with great honor to the Pallace, the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> being mightily grieued with his di&s;grace, as al&s;o fearing the di&s;like of <HI>Emilia,</HI> retired to his Tent, min|ding not to come foorth of the Li&s;tes, till &s;uch time as h&eacute;e had recouered &s;ome part of his lo&s;t honor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How the Duke defending his Ladies beautie, ouercame di|uers Knights, &amp; how the Engli&s;h Prince being di&s;gui&s;ed, entred the Li&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>_THe next day, no &s;ooner had bright <HI>Aurora</HI> vnbard her chri&s;tall gates, and bridgrome like &s;tept foorth, the glorious &s;unne &s;preading her &s;iluer raies on old <HI>Neptunes</HI> face, but that the lu&s;ty Duke prickt on with his for|mer
<PB REF="31"> dayes di&s;grace, hoping to recouer his lo&s;t honour, was all armed, &s;itting on hor&s;eback with his Launce in his hand, cau&s;ing the trumpets to &s;ound, to &s;ummon vnto the battel tho&s;e, who in defence of their Ladies beauties, would hazard the~&s;elues, to try the doubtfull verdit of angry <HI>Mars.</HI> The Duke bare in his &s;hield the portrature of a man, with the one hand renting his owne bowels, and with the other pre&s;enting his hart to a fayre Lady, which &s;&eacute;emed little to regard or to e&s;t&eacute;eme the &s;ame, with this word or motto written ouer their heads, <HI>I liue through hope:</HI> all the re&s;t of his Armor was &s;et full of flaming harts, which &s;&eacute;emed very liuely to burne.</P>
<P>Hee had not long remained on hor&s;ebacke, before &s;uch time that the King, and mo&s;t part of the Lords and Prin|ces, hauing taken their places to behold the i&s;&s;ue of his en|terpri&s;e, there entred the li&s;tes a gallant young Knight, &s;onne vnto the Marcus of <HI>Ferara,</HI> his Armor all gr&eacute;ene, and in his Shield he bare two harts combind in one, with the&s;e words, <HI>Nil timeo.</HI> H&eacute;e brought likewi&s;e a &s;mall che&s;t coue|red ouer with thinne plates of &s;iluer, in which was inclo|&s;ed the liuely portrature of his Lady, who was daughter vnto the Duke of <HI>Millaine.</HI> In this &s;ort comming vnto the Duke, he told him, vnle&s;&s;e he were mi&s;informed, the con|tents of his Challenge was, that tho&s;e Knights that by him were ouercome, &s;hould leaue behind them their coate-ar|mors, and al&s;o their Mi&s;tri&s;es portrature, to be placed at the f&eacute;ete of the fayre <HI>Emilia,</HI> and &s;o to depart: but who&s;oeuer &s;hould ouercome him, &s;hould likewi&s;e haue the de&s;po&s;ing of the portratures that there were hanging, and to defend the Challenge the re&s;t of the time, except he hapned likewi&s;e to be vanqui&s;ht. The Duke aun&s;wered, that the &s;ame was his Challenge: but the coate-armors were to be put of pre|&s;ently if they were vnhor&s;ed, and afterwards, if they would hazard the Combat with him, they &s;hould. And as for the portratures, hee hoped his &s;hould be the fir&s;t which &s;hould be placed, &s;&eacute;eing the difference of their beauties did already manife&s;t it.</P>
<PB REF="32">
<P>Then departing the one from the other, they placed their Launces in theyr re&s;ts, and &s;etting &s;purres to their hor&s;es, they met together &s;o fiercely, that their Speares flew into the ayre: and comming together with their bodies, they &s;trake one the other &s;o rudely, that the Duke lo&s;t both his &s;tirrups, and was forced to &s;tay him&s;elfe by his hor&s;e neck, but the other was ouerthrowne hor&s;e &amp; man to the ground, and by chance not able to cl&eacute;ere him&s;elfe, was &s;ore bru&s;ed by his hor&s;e, not beeing able to get vp againe: then y^e Duke di&s;mounting, holpe to get him from vnder his hor&s;e, which curte&s;ie the other perceiuing, pre&s;ently put off his coate-ar|mor and departed the Li&s;tes, b&eacute;eing by rea&s;on of his bru&s;e not able to combat. Then the Duke cau&s;ed his Ladies picture to be placed at the f&eacute;ete of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and calling vnto him one of his Pages, &s;ent her the Coate-armor, which &s;he receaued, willing him to tell his Mai&s;ter, hee had doone more then &s;he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Next vnto him of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> entred the Li&s;ts that day, the Lord of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> bringing with him the picture of the Duke of <HI>Poyters</HI> daughter, whom he earne&s;tly loued, and was likewi&s;e at the &s;econd cour&s;e vnhor&s;ed, to his great &s;o|row, but yet not minding to hazard the Combat, becau&s;e the Duke was accounted the be&s;t combatter on foote in all <HI>Fraunce,</HI> departed. After him came diuers others, who were all &s;erued in the &s;ame &s;ort, for that day he vnhor&s;ed in all the number of 22. Knights, placing their Ladies Pic|tures according to their de&s;erts. The next day came into the Li&s;tes young <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> very de&s;irous to be re|uenged, for the di&s;grace of the Lord <HI>Montgomery</HI> his co&s;in, yet al&s;o bringing with him the picture of a Dam&s;ell whom he &s;omewhat loued: but his comming was more to winne honour on the Duke, then to obtaine his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es fauor. He bare in his Shield, <HI>Paris</HI> and the thr&eacute;e Godde&s;&s;es, but giuing the Apple to neither, with this motto, <HI>Cuique ne&s;|cio,</HI> &s;ignifying therby the vncon&s;tancie of his mind in loue. At the fir&s;t cour&s;e they brake their Launces to their hands, not &s;o much as once moouing one the other: then taking
<PB REF="32"> new Launces, they met againe &s;o furiou&s;ly, that <HI>Henrie</HI> had much to doe to keepe his &s;addle, and the Duke loo&s;ing one of his &s;tirrups, and his raines of his bridle, pa&s;t on like|wi&s;e, and making an end of their carreare, <HI>Henry</HI> returned with his &s;word in his hand, which the Duke perceiuing, drew forth his al&s;o, beginning betw&eacute;ene them a right fierce and dangerous conflict. But the Duke b&eacute;eing better expe|rienced fought with the greater aduantage, giuing <HI>Henry</HI> leaue a while to follow the rage of his furie, thereby the &s;oo|ner to weary him&s;elfe. Which ind&eacute;ede he did, when the Duke more fiercely then before a&s;&s;aulted him, cau&s;ing him to &s;&eacute;eke how to couer and defend him&s;elfe vnder his &s;hield. At length, b&eacute;eing wounded in many places, and hauing lo&s;t very much blood, he fell from his hor&s;e in a&s;wound, to the great griefe of the King, &amp; all the beholders, who great|ly feared lea&s;t he had b&eacute;en &s;laine. But b&eacute;eing conuayed out of the field, and his wounds bound vp, and &s;tanched, hee was &s;oone brought to him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>After him, the Duke ouercame twelue other Knights, not any of them b&eacute;eing able to indure again&s;t him, &s;o intol|lerable were his blowes: which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince percei|uing, and grieuing to behold, the next day determined vn|knowne to any one, to enter the Li&s;tes di&s;gui&s;ed, where he did not doubt but h&eacute;e would &s;oone abate his pride, and re|&s;oluing hereof, the next morning he armed him&s;elfe, and b&eacute;eing mounted on a good hor&s;e, his Armor &s;&eacute;eming all ru|&s;tie, and his &s;h&eacute;eld couered ouer with leather, painted with a Kite and an Eagle flying after a Doue, with this word, <HI>Not to obtaine,</HI> he entred the li&s;ts, euen at &s;uch time as the Duke had ouerthrowne an <HI>Enli&s;h</HI> Knight which put him|&s;elfe again&s;t him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. Howe Prince <HI>Edward</HI> ouercame the Duke, and afterwards continued in the Li&s;tes the re&s;t of the time, ouercomming diuers Knights, and of his declaring his loue to <HI>Emilia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Prince b&eacute;eing entred as afore is de|clared, gaue cau&s;e of admiration vnto all beholders, as well by rea&s;on of his fur|niture, as al&s;o the deuice of his Shielde, yet was he by the King and diuers others much commended, for his cunning pro|portion, &amp; gallant managing of his hor&s;e, the King &s;aying vnto the Qu&eacute;ene &amp; the Duke of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> that hee much feared, lea&s;t that Knight would beare away all the honor fro~ the Duke, which in the two former daies he had wonne. But the Duke him&s;elfe b&eacute;eing puffed vp with the former victories, nothing at all e&s;t&eacute;emed him, and comming vnto him, demaunded for his Ladies picture, for who&s;e fauour he was to vndertake the Combat.</P>
<P>The &s;trange Knight replied, that her pieture was inclo|&s;ed in his hart, and trauailing through that Country, hea|ring of his Challenge, came purpo&s;ely thother to try his fortune again&s;t him, not hauing the time to prouide any o|ther portrature, then that which hee had already told him of. The Duke made aun&s;wer, that then he could not com|bat again&s;t him, in regard that ouerco~ming him, hee &s;hould loo&s;e the guerdon of his Conque&s;t. But yet &s;&eacute;eing h&eacute;e had &s;uch an earne&s;t de&s;ire, he &s;hould in &s;t&eacute;ed of her picture, leaue behind him both his Ladies name, and his &s;hield, to be pla|ced at his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Prince h&eacute;ereto willingly con&s;ented: and ca&s;ting his eye to y^e place where the Ladies were &s;tanding, after a little pau&s;e, &s;ayd. Know then Sir Duke that the Ladie whom I &s;o much loue and e&s;t&eacute;eme, and who&s;e vertues and graces are &s;o d&eacute;eply fixed in my hart, that naught but death can ex|tingui&s;h the &s;ame, is the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite, &amp; beautifull Prin|ce&s;&s;e
<PB REF="33"> <HI>Emilia</HI> h&eacute;ere pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Duke beeing no longer able to harken to his &s;p&eacute;e|ches, being his coriuall: an&s;wered, no doubt but thy folly, hath ouercome thy braines, &amp; rightly doth y^e figure on thy &s;hield &s;ignifie thy madne&s;&s;e, which is the &s;elfe &s;ame Kite there repre&s;ented, which &s;&eacute;eketh before the Eagle to obtaine the Doue: but thou &s;halt pre&s;ently f&eacute;ele, the reward of thy folly, if thou abide but the &s;troke of my Launce. Then tur|ning about his hor&s;e, not &s;taying for any farther reply, went to fetch his cour&s;e, the other doing the like, and &s;etting &s;purres to their hor&s;es, placing their &s;taues in their re&s;ts, they ran together furiou&s;ly, &amp; like two fierce rammes &s;tri|uing for &s;uperiority, leauing a great di&s;tance betw&eacute;ene them, that with the more might, they may come together with their horned heads, &s;o met the&s;e worthy Knights, cau|&s;ing their Launces to flie into the aire, being broken into a thou&s;and &s;h&eacute;euers, and m&eacute;eting together with their bodies, cau&s;es their hor&s;es to r&eacute;ele backwards, to the wounder of the beholders, but quickly recouering them&s;elues, they be|ganne to a&s;&s;ault the one the other: &s;&eacute;eking by all meanes, either, how mo&s;t to indanger his aduer&s;arie, and to &s;aue him&s;elfe: at length the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince lifting vp his &s;word aloft, &s;tarke the Duke directly on the vpper part of his &s;hield &s;o &s;trong a blow, that cleauing it into two p&eacute;eces, his &s;word pa&s;&s;ed forwards wounding him in the left thygh, but that blow was not long vnreuenged, for lifting vp his &s;word with both hands, &amp; rai&s;ing him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrups, gaue the Prince &s;uch a blow on the head, that had he not taken it with his &s;heild, that blow had ended the battaile: but neuerthele&s;&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing through both &s;hield and Helme, he gaue him a &s;mall hurt in the head, cau&s;ing him halfe a|&s;tonied to r&eacute;ele from &s;ide to &s;ide, but before he could deliuer another blow, the Prince had recouered him&s;elfe, and com|ming in more fiercely then before, &s;trooke at his head, but by rea&s;on of the &s;tarting of his hor&s;e, the blow lighted on his &s;houlder, breaking the buckles and reuits of his poul|dron, and &s;liding downe, gaue his hor&s;e &s;uch a wound,
<PB REF="34"> that being no longer able to containe his Mai&s;ters weight, fell to the ground, which the Duke perceauing, made the greater &s;p&eacute;ede to auoyd his Saddle, and cl&eacute;ering him|&s;elfe, recouered vpon his f&eacute;ete: which the Prince &s;&eacute;eing, a|lighted al&s;o, then taking their &s;words and &s;hields in hand, they beganne a mo&s;t cruell and dangerous foote combat, to the amazement of all the beholders, who neuer had &s;&eacute;ene the like: for being both inraged with enuy and di&s;daine, like Lions m&eacute;ete, or Bulls, or Tigers, fierce prickt on with hungers rage, finding a pray, or booty to their minds, fall out and &s;triue, and both with t&eacute;eth, horne, and nayles, wound one the other, renting their entrailes, and dying them&s;elues, and gra&s;&s;e with bloud, &s;o &s;troue the&s;e two, and with their continued equall fight, their &s;t&eacute;ely Armor being not able to hold out the blowes, nor defend the thru&s;ts, wherewith the one &s;till wounded the other, no man being able to iudge, to which &s;ide the victorie would incline, eue|ry one meruailing who the &s;trange Knight &s;hould bee: at la&s;t the Duke beganne &s;omewhat to &s;hrinke backe, and to bare the remnant of his &s;hield very low, which the Prince perceauing, &s;&eacute;emed to increa&s;e his &s;trength, and followed him more fiercely then before, driuing him from place to place, till at la&s;t comming before the window where <HI>Emi|lia</HI> &s;toode, the Prince ca&s;ting vp his &s;ight towards her, imediatly &s;tood as one in a traunce, which the other per|ceauing, beganne againe to gather courage, and gaue him two or thr&eacute;e mighty blowes, telling him that hee would bring him out of his dumpes. Tis true replied the Prince, being halfe a&s;hamed at his folly, but to your paine. Then plucking vp him&s;elfe, they renewed their battaile, which &s;&eacute;emed like to the burning of &s;ome hidden flaxe: hauing a while e&s;capt the extremitie of the fire, which had before con|&s;umed great woods &amp; tr&eacute;es, and &s;&eacute;eming to be extingui&s;ht, pre&s;ently renewes a flame againe, and &s;o goes out. Such was their latter &s;trife, for the Prince being row&s;ed from his &s;lumber, per&s;ued him with &s;o many waighty blowes, that the Duke being no longer able to hold out, fell to the
<PB REF="34"> ground in a traunce: which the Iudges perceiuing, came &s;p&eacute;edily vnto them, fearing lea&s;t the &s;trange Knight would haue proffered him farther violence, but he, putting vp his &s;word, demaunded whether there was ought el&s;e to bee doone. The County <HI>Palatine</HI> aun&s;wered, nothing but to de|fend the place as the Duke had before. Then the Duke was conuaied away, and being vnarmed, was dre&s;&s;ed by the Surgians, which found no dangerous wound, but that his great lo&s;&s;e of bloud, cau&s;ed him to bee extreame weake and faintie. The Duke beeing couayed away, the King was very de&s;irous to know who the &s;trange Knight &s;hould bee, and being about to &s;end one vnto him, to that end. The Prince pre&s;ented him&s;elfe before him, and pulling of his Helme, de&s;ired his Maie&s;tie to grant him leaue to con|tinue the Dukes challendge: when the King beheld him, and &s;aw that it was the Prince, who had &s;ubdued y^e Duke, his griefe for his hurts, and ouerthrow was &s;omewhat ea&s;ed. Then &s;peaking to the Prince, hee &s;ayd, my Lord I did not thinke you would haue thus delt with vs, as vn|knowne, thus to haue put vs into &s;uch griefe, as you haue doone by the wounding, and vanqui&s;hing of the Duke our Co&s;in: yet &s;eeing it was his owne folly in making the chal|lendge, it doth the le&s;&s;e grieue vs. But for your reque&s;t in continuance thereof: I would wi&s;h you rather, to giue it ouer then to indanger your &s;elfe therein, but if &s;o be you are &s;o minded, we fr&eacute;ely grant you leaue, praying to God &s;end you better hap, then the Duke hath had before you. The Prince humbly thanked his Maie&s;tie: and then tur|ning to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> intreated her likewi&s;e to graunt him leaue, as her father had doone to defend her beautie, &s;&eacute;eing that it was his hap to obtaine the &s;ame by his good Fortune. The Prince&s;&s;e being before hand a little touched with his loue, and now &s;&eacute;eing the paines and dan|ger, which he vndertooke for her &s;ake, was altogether o|uercome: wherefore dying her ch&eacute;ekes with a maidenly blu&s;h, &s;he told him the paines which he already tooke, and that he would againe indure for her &s;ake, was vnknowne vnto
<PB REF="35"> her: yet becau&s;e &s;he would not prooue di&s;curtious, nor in|gratefull, &s;&eacute;eing the King her father had thereto con&s;ented, &s;he was content to accept him for her Knight, and to alow of that which he reque&s;ted. The Prince h&eacute;erewith beeing meruailous contented, returned her harty thankes, and &s;o departed againe to the Tent, where hee was met by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prince, the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and many others: and was by them di&s;armed, and after din|ner, his wounds being bound vp, hee armed him&s;elfe a|gaine in a mo&s;t co&s;tly Armor, &s;et all with true loue knots, wrought of pure gold, and beeing attended by the fore&s;ayd Lords, he entred the Li&s;ts: where hee had not long remai|ned before &s;uch time, that there came a Knight of the King|dome of <HI>Naples:</HI> a man in tho&s;e parts famou&s;ed for his va|lor and hardine&s;&s;e, and being inamored on a young Dam|&s;ell of that Country, promi&s;ed her to come into <HI>France,</HI> whereby his valor, hee would cau&s;e her to bee for euer fa|mou&s;ed: but his hap was &s;o hard that at the fir&s;t encoun|ter, he was &s;ent to mea&s;ure his length in the ground, not being able to combat. After him that day, and the next day, he vnhor&s;ed to y^e number of 40 Knights: the la&s;t day there came very fewe to try them&s;elues, the mo&s;t part hauing in the fiue former daies, b&eacute;ene by the Duke foyled, by meanes whereof he pa&s;t away the time in companie of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prince, and other great Lords, vntill it was almo&s;t Sun &s;et, at which time there entred an ill fauoured withered face fellow, &s;omething heigher then thr&eacute;e hor&s;e loaues, by birth a pagan, but brought vp by the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Portugall,</HI> as her Dwarfe, this proper aplo&s;quire falling in loue with a Dam&s;ell, almo&s;t as han&s;ome as him&s;elfe, being likewi&s;e attending on the Queene, and hauing obtained her good liking on that condition, that he &s;hould in all places main|taine her beauty: de&s;ired the Qu&eacute;ene that hee might be made Knight, a&s;&s;uring her that he would &s;o behaue him|&s;elfe, that thee and all others &s;hould thinke the order well be&s;towed vpon him. The Qu&eacute;ene &s;&eacute;eing his earne&s;tne&s;&s;e y&eacute;elded vnto him, and cau&s;ed him to be Knighted, who no
<PB REF="35"> &s;ooner hauing receaued the order, and hearing of the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> challendge, but he determined to fight again&s;t him, and cau&s;e him to confe&s;&s;e his peate, to more beauti|full then <HI>Emilia.</HI> Continuing in this imagination, he cau|&s;ed her Picture to be drawne, and therewith came vnto <HI>Parris,</HI> entring the Li&s;ts at &s;uch time, as the Prince with the other Lords were ready to depart, and comming vnto the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prince, demaunded which was he that had o|uercome the Duke. The Prince meruailing to &s;&eacute;e &s;uch a gallant in that equipage, demaunded what he would with him, marry quoth the Dwarfe fight with him, and cau&s;e him to confe&s;&s;e, that the Dam&s;ell which I loue, doth excell in beauty all others: the Prince &s;milling, hauing much a|doe to containe him&s;elfe from laughter, demaunded who was his Lady, and where her Picture was. Hee aun&s;we|red &s;he was attending on the Qu&eacute;ene of <HI>Portugall,</HI> and therewith drew foorth her Picture, at &s;ight whereof euery one bur&s;t foorth in a great laughter. The Dwarfe being h&eacute;erewith angry, a&s;ked the Prince whether it were he or no that he had inquired for, the Prince aun&s;wered no, but &s;howed him the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, withall telling him that the time was pa&s;t, whereby h&eacute;e had lo&s;t his labor, vnle&s;&s;e h&eacute;e could intreate him to Iu&s;t willingly.</P>
<P>Then the Dwarfe comming vnto him, intreated him if the time were pa&s;t, that yet in courti&s;ie he would breake a Launce with him: he &s;milling aun&s;wered, that betw&eacute;ene that and Sunne &s;et, hee was bound to Iu&s;t with any that &s;hould come, wherefore he was contented. Then taking each of them a Launce, they ranne together: the Prince mi&s;&s;ing his cour&s;e of purpo&s;e, but the Dwarfe with much adoe brake his Launce, almo&s;t di&s;mounting him&s;elfe with his owne &s;troke. The King, &amp; Qu&eacute;ene, withall the Lords and Ladies, laughed hartily h&eacute;ereat: the Dutches of <HI>Bur|bone</HI> telling <HI>Emilia,</HI> that now her Knight was like to loo&s;e all his former honor.</P>
<P>The Dwarfe had no &s;ooner broken his Launce, but pre|&s;ently he drew forth his &s;woord, but y^e Prince intreated him,
<PB REF="36"> to runne one cour&s;e more, which he ea&s;ily y&eacute;elded vnto, then taking a new &s;peare, they ranne againe: the Prince taking him in the mid&s;t of his Shield, bare him out of his &s;addle a whole &s;peares length, not b&eacute;eing able to ri&s;e from y^e ground. Then was &s;ent vnto him by the King, the young Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> his &s;onne, to intreate him to come to the Pallace, whether he went, b&eacute;eing accompanied with diuers great Lords and Knights, and was very roially receiued by the King, the Qu&eacute;ene, and their fayre daughter, and fea&s;ted with many &s;umptuous and rare &s;orts of viands, after &s;up|per, they fell againe to theyr wonted &s;ports of dauncing and ma&s;king: where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince againe made his loue knowne vnto <HI>Emilia,</HI> a&s;&s;uring her, that vnle&s;&s;e &s;h&eacute;e pittied his e&s;tate, he was but dead, for without her, he was but as a &s;hadow without &s;ub&s;tance, or as a body without a &s;oule. The Prince&s;&s;e, who by this time was as much &s;corched with the flame as hee, and did f&eacute;ele as great force of loue, knew not well what to aun&s;were, but at la&s;t y&eacute;elding to loue, &s;he told him, that if he loued her as hee made &s;hew of, &s;h&eacute;e had no rea&s;on but to requite him with the like, but as yet &s;h&eacute;e was young, and at her Parents di&s;po&s;ition, with|out who&s;e con&s;ent &s;he could not make her owne choy&s;e, but if he could obtaine her Fathers con&s;ent, &s;hee was likewi&s;e contented to accept of him as her Lord and hu&s;band.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. How the young Princes of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Saxonie,</HI> beeing brought vp together, were &s;o like, that they could &s;carce be knowne one from the other, &amp; of theyr mutuall loue.</HEAD>
<P>_YOV remember how the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> bringing with him the young Prince of <HI>Denmarke</HI> into his Dutchie, cau&s;ed him to be brought vp with his own &s;onne, calling him by the name of the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, becau&s;e they knew no other name that he had. The Dutches, partly by the commandement of her hu&s;band, &amp; partly for the beautie &s;hee beheld in him, made great account of him, v&s;ing to play and dandle with him, as much as with her owne &s;onne: by meanes where|of, in &s;hort time he beganne to recouer a fre&s;h and liuely co|lour, and &s;till the elder they grew, the more like the children &s;&eacute;emed the one to the other: and as in likenes, &s;o al&s;o grew they in loue one to the other, delighting alwaies to be to|gether. And b&eacute;eing but children, if any one had hapned to wrong either of them, the other would alwaies helpe to be reuenged, which bred in the Duke and Dutches, &s;o great content as might be. But comming to the age of 7. y&eacute;eres, they were in&s;tructed in the Latine and Gr&eacute;eke tongues, by a Tutor who~ the Duke had appointed them for their bring|ing vp. H&eacute;e b&eacute;eing a very wife and di&s;cr&eacute;et Knight, who in former time had &s;pent his youthfull dayes in traueling &s;trange Countries, and &s;eeking after aduentures, as was the v&s;age of Knights arrant: hee hauing as before is &s;aid, the charge of education of the two Princes committed vnto him, in&s;tructed them &s;o well, that in &s;hort time they profi|ted very much in tho&s;e languages, e&s;pecially the Gentle|man of the Forre&s;t, as b&eacute;eing of a more quick and readie wit, but otherwi&s;e, theyr di&s;po&s;itions, &amp; con&s;titutions both of mind and body were &s;o like, that the Duke was forced to &s;et marks whereby to know them: and theyr loue in like
<PB REF="37"> manner was &s;o great, that had the one b&eacute;ene &s;icke or ill at ea&s;e, the other &s;&eacute;emed to be a partner in his griefe: if the one laughed, the other was ioyfull, if the one wept, the o|ther mu&s;t n&eacute;edes mourne to bare him company, &s;uch a &s;im|pathy of loue had Nature infu&s;ed in them, that it was al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the one to liue without the others com|pany.</P>
<P>And comming to the age of twelue y&eacute;eres, they were in|&s;tructed by theyr Tutor, to ride and manage hor&s;es, wher|in they &s;o much profited, that in &s;hort time they wexed very &s;kilfull, e&s;pecially the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, who both in aptnes of mind, and agilitie of body, pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite of his time: which cau&s;ed the Duke &s;o much y^e more to loue and e&s;t&eacute;eme of him, hoping that in time, God would manife&s;t from whence, and of what parentage he was di&s;|cended, imagining as well by his beauty, as al&s;o by his rare forwardnes, y^t he mu&s;t n&eacute;edes be i&s;&s;ued of noble blood. The Dutches likewi&s;e grew into &s;o great a liking of him, for his diuers rare and &s;inguler vertues, y^t &s;he many times deui&s;ed with her&s;elfe, how and by what meanes &s;he might cau&s;e him to loue her daughter, whom hee e&s;t&eacute;emed as his Si&s;ter, a Lady for beauty excellent, and for the perfections of the mind, able to compare with any then liuing. Sh&eacute;e I &s;ay, b&eacute;eing of this mind, oftentimes re&s;olued to motion the matter vnto him, and to di&s;couer vnto him the manner of his finding, which vnto him was vnknowne, by rea&s;on he was alwaies held and accounted as their naturall Childe: yet thinking that cour&s;e might be a meanes, whe~ he &s;hould come to age, for to for&s;ake their Court, to &s;&eacute;eke for his true Parents, &s;hee gaue ouer that determination, minding to conferre with the Duke her hu&s;band thereof. And finding him one night very merry, and plea&s;antly di&s;cour&s;ing, and commending of both the young Princes vnto her, &s;hee de|clared vnto him her mind, and affirmed, that in her con&s;ci|ence, there could be no better match for her daughter, &s;&eacute;eing his vertuous behauiour, which was more to be e&s;t&eacute;emed then my riches what&s;oeuer. The Duke did not greatlie
<PB REF="37"> di&s;like h&eacute;ereof, but yet thought it fitter to bee left alone, vntill &s;uch time as both of them &s;hould attaine to a more riper yeares, for as then he was but 12 yeares old, and &s;h&eacute;e nine yeares old. H&eacute;ere againe will we leaue them, to &s;peake of the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and his companie: who after they departed from the Ladies Ca&s;tle, tooke their waies to|wards the confines of <HI>Germanie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. How the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> trauelling through <HI>Germanie,</HI> arri|ued in the Citty of <HI>&V;iena</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> where hee vnder|tooke the defence of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady, wrongfully accu|&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> departing from the Ladies Ca&s;tle whom he had re&s;cued, at time &s;uch as he parted from the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> being accom|panied with Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and his Squire: rode on a long time without finding any aduenture worth the remem|brance, euer inquiring after Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with the re&s;t of their companie. At length pa&s;&s;ing through many Townes of <HI>Germanie,</HI> they arriued in a Citty of the Dukedome of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> called <HI>Viena:</HI> bordering almo&s;t on the confines of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> being as then the chiefe Citty of that prouince, and as then vnder the gouernance of a mo&s;t &s;tirne and rigorous Prince, named Duke <HI>Otho.</HI> Who for his tiranous cruelty, was greatly feared of all his neighbour Potentates, and &s;carcely beloued of his owne naturall Subiects: hee was a man for vallor, and hardine&s;&s;e greatly e&s;t&eacute;emed, and had not his outragious crueltie, and bea&s;tly &s;en&s;uallity &s;tayned his Vertues, h&eacute;e might well haue b&eacute;ene compared with any Prince, then liuing within the confines of Chri&s;tendome: but rage and &s;en&s;uall appetites doth commonly &s;o abound, e&s;pecially in the harts of great men, whom God hath giuen ouer to
<PB REF="38"> them&s;elues, that vertue is altogether choked, and &s;wal|lowed vp in vice, as might well appeare in this Duke <HI>O|tho.</HI> Who (&s;o he might haue) cared not by what meanes he came by it: as by the &s;equell of this Chapter, you &s;hall more plainly vnder&s;tand.</P>
<P>This Duke had within his territories, a mo&s;t gracious and vertuous Ladie, beeing &s;ole heyre vnto her father, who was a man of large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and greatly beloued in his Country, for his vertuous and vpright dealings to euery man. This noble Gentleman dying, and leauing his daughter about the age of 15 or 16 yeares, was &s;ought vnto of many great and mighty Lords: &s;ome for her lands and liuings, others for her beauty and vertues, and diuers for both. But to make &s;hort this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hee was at la&s;t wooed, and wonne by a Knight of that Country, called <HI>Ho&s;tinius:</HI> a man who for his vertues and vallor in Chi|ualry, might be thought equal with any Knight, in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and being married vnto the young Lady <HI>Vitella,</HI> they &s;o well loued and liked together, that they &s;carce one euer gaue cau&s;e of di&s;like to the other, which cau&s;ed them to b&eacute;e commended, and prai&s;ed through all the Dukedome, and the confines there abouts: but this ioy and content, had not continued fully the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e yeares, before that froward Fortune enuying their ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, cau&s;ed her fame to be re&s;ounded in y^e eares of the Duke <HI>Otho.</HI> Who&s;e lu&s;tfull hart beeing &s;et on fire with report of her beauty, cau&s;ed both her and her hu&s;band to be &s;ent for to his Court, where beeing arriued, hee at the fir&s;t mo&s;t kindly receaued them, and as the old prouerbe is, made much of the childe for the Nur&s;&s;es &s;ake: &s;o hee intertained <HI>Ho&s;tinius,</HI> v&s;ing him with all the familiarity that might bee for his wifes &s;ake, alwaies &s;&eacute;eking opportunity, to make knowne his lu&s;tfull loue vnto <HI>Vitilla.</HI> And one day finding her &s;tan|ding at a window, looking into the Pallace garden: h&eacute;e came vnto her, and after a little idle prattle, fetching a d&eacute;epe fained &s;igh, he declared vnto her his loue, vowing and pro|te&s;ting, vnle&s;&s;e &s;he tooke pitty on him, and yeeld to his de|&s;ire,
<PB REF="38"> there was no way but death with him, aleaging that as her beauty had wounded him, &s;o was it her part to rel&eacute;eue and comfort him againe, declaring that as by na|ture &s;he was faire, &s;o likewi&s;e ought &s;he to bee kind &amp; mer|cifull.</P>
<P>The good Lady b&eacute;eing halfe in a maze with this vnloo|ked for proces, and &s;carce knowing how to aun&s;wer him, con&s;idering his nature to be &s;uch, that an ab&s;olute deniall might cau&s;e him to grow into choller, both with her and her hu&s;band, and therby to worke both theyr confu&s;ions. And likewi&s;e to f&eacute;ede him on with fained &s;p&eacute;eches of loue, might bring her name in que&s;tion of &s;launder, &amp; though for a time by that meanes &s;he might put him off, yet in the end, &s;&eacute;eing him&s;elfe deluded, he would reuenge him&s;elfe with the grea|ter crueltie, determined therefore of two euils to chu&s;e the lea&s;t: wherefore &s;he replyed in this manner.</P>
<P>My gracious Lorde, I doe not thinke that you will &s;o much di&s;honour your &s;elfe, as by forcing of mee to violate the holy rites of marriage, and to wrong my Lord and hu&s;|band in that &s;ort, as by your &s;p&eacute;eches you pretend, which if you goe about to performe, know for certainty, that God who created all things of nought, will &s;euerely puni&s;h and reuenge &s;o great a crime: and likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe my Lord, that whil&s;t I haue power and &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t, you &s;hall neuer obtaine the &s;ame, wherefore I would wi&s;h your honor to giue ouer all &s;uch wicked imaginations. And here|with &s;he flung away fro~ him in a great chafe, leauing him mu&s;ing on her &s;hort aun&s;wer, and deui&s;ing which way h&eacute;e might bring his will to pa&s;&s;e, at la&s;t re&s;olued with him&s;elfe, that there was no way to accompli&s;h the &s;ame, but onely by the death of her hu&s;band, hoping that hee b&eacute;eing dead, &s;h&eacute;e might be brought to any thing. And b&eacute;eing thus re&s;ol|ued, he went downe into the great Hall, where finding di|uers of <HI>Ho&s;tinius</HI> &s;eruaunts, h&eacute;e made choice of one, whom he &s;aw continually mo&s;t n&eacute;ere vnto him: and taking him a &s;ide, declared vnto him his intent, and at la&s;t, with large promi&s;es wonne him, both to con&s;ent, and al&s;o to be the
<PB REF="39"> Actor of his Lords tragedie, which in this &s;ort was acted. About &s;ome thr&eacute;e nights after their agr&eacute;ement, <HI>E&s;tonio,</HI> for &s;o was that fal&s;e &s;eruaunt named, hauing gotten a &s;l&eacute;eping powder, &s;o cunningly co~uayde it into the wine which both his Lord and Lady dranke of, with &s;ome of the re&s;t of their n&eacute;ere&s;t attendants, that b&eacute;eing layd in their bedds, none of them awaked till the morning. In the meane time, euen a|bout midnight, when both by nature, and effect of theyr drench, they were &s;ounde&s;t a&s;l&eacute;epe, then entred the damna|ble Traytor, and draue into his Lords head a naile, which he had no &s;ooner performed, but hiding the hammer wher|with he had committed that cruell homicide, vnder the bed, he departed to his owne bed, where he remained vntill the next day, that all the re&s;t of his fellowes, were ri&s;en, and the Chamberlaine, as was his cu&s;tome, came, and &s;oftly knocked at his Lords chamber-doore, wherewith the Lady awaked, and turning about, &s;h&eacute;e found her Lord and hu&s;|band as cold as Ice, which &s;trake &s;uch a terror in her hart, that fetching a great &s;hr&eacute;eke, &s;he likewi&s;e fell into a traunce. Her dam&s;els which attended her, hearing the &s;hr&eacute;eke, fea|ring &s;h&eacute;e was not well, entred the Chamber, where they found their Lord dead, and theyr Lady in little better ca&s;e, but at length, hauing recouered life in her, they called in the Gentlemen his attendants, who b&eacute;eing entred, it is vn|po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;orrow and lamentation which was made, where <HI>E&s;tonio,</HI> in outward &s;hewe, &s;&eacute;emed not to be lea&s;t &s;orrowfull, &s;o well knew he how to di&s;&s;emble the mat|ter. At la&s;t, the rumor heereof came to the eares of Duke <HI>Otho,</HI> who pre&s;ently like a man inraged with griefe, hee came po&s;ting to the Chamber, where at his fir&s;t entrance, to make &s;hew of the loue which hee bare to the dead bodie b&eacute;eing liuing, h&eacute;e rent his hayre, beating his brea&s;t, prote|&s;ting that he would haue giuen halfe his dukedome, to haue him aliue againe, although (GOD knowes) he him&s;elfe was the onely cau&s;e of his death. The good Lady, &s;hee in the meane time &s;wounded, and re&s;wounded, and had it not b&eacute;ene for the dam&s;els, without all doubt &s;hee would haue
<PB REF="39"> borne her hu&s;band company among&s;t the dead, &s;&eacute;eing &s;h&eacute;e was depriued of him among&s;t the liuing: &s;o extreame was the gr&eacute;efe which &s;he felt, &amp; &s;o great the loue which &s;hee bare him.</P>
<P>The Duke in the meane time, for the better obtayning of his purpo&s;e, cau&s;ed y^e dead body to be imbaulmed, &s;aying he would haue him buried with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity that might be, as the man whom he mo&s;t loued: and becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to be performed &s;o &s;uddenly, he would haue him k&eacute;ept vnburied, by the &s;pace of a month, again&s;t which time he warned all the ch&eacute;efe of his Subiects to be there. Hoping in y^e meane time by one meanes or other, to worke <HI>Vitella</HI> to his will, wherefore euery day he would come to vi&s;ite her: many times declaring his pa&s;&s;ions vnto her, de|&s;iring her to con&s;ent and y&eacute;eld thereto. But &s;he good Lady, not minding &s;o &s;oone to forget him whom &s;he loued &s;o d&eacute;ere|ly, neither yet to make choi&s;e of one whom for his wicked life, &s;he could not chu&s;e but hate: and al&s;o, by his impor|tant &s;ute, imagining that to gaine her, he might by &s;ome kinde of poy&s;on, haue made away her hu&s;band, &s;&eacute;eing that &s;o &s;uddenly he died: gaue him this aun&s;were.</P>
<P>My Lord, I know not the cau&s;e of this your importu|nate &s;ute, neither can I thinke but that it proc&eacute;eds from a vild and &s;infull minde, that profe&s;&s;ing &s;o great loue as you did to my late Lord and hu&s;band, you would tempt me his wofull wife &s;o &s;oone to forget him, and commit &s;o vile an offence before God: wherfore know for a certainty, that I neither can, nor will co~&s;ent to loue him, whom my minde per&s;wads me to bee y^e de&s;troyer of my late decea&s;ed Lord &amp; hu&s;band: for without you had therein b&eacute;ene guiltfull, you would not haue per&s;i&s;ted in this your wicked per&s;ute after my hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Duke knowing him&s;elfe guilty, in that where|with &s;he had accu&s;ed him, &amp; al&s;o growing into chollor with her rude deniall, briefly replied. Lady I perceaue that, that which cannot be obtained by faire meanes, mu&s;t now at length be wonne by foule: and &s;&eacute;eing that you wil not wil|lingly
<PB REF="40"> con&s;ent vnto the thing, which in kind and milde &s;ort I haue intreated of you, know for a certainty, that I will winne it by force: &amp; whereas you accu&s;e me of murdering of thy vnfortunate hu&s;band, a&s;&s;ure thy &s;elfe that the guilte thereof, &s;hall lighten on thy owne head: which I my &s;elfe will iu&s;tifie again&s;t th&eacute;e. And thus &s;aying, he departed her chamber, changing all his former loue into cruell hate, al|waies pondring in his minde reuenge, till &s;uch time, as his Nobles being come together, for the &s;olemnizing of the funerals, at which time (comming as if hee would haue viewed the dead corpes) with &s;ome of his nobillity, laying his hand on his head, on a &s;udden he &s;&eacute;emed to f&eacute;ele y^e nayle: when fetching a d&eacute;epe &s;igh, hee cryed out, that his d&eacute;ere friend <HI>Ho&s;tinius,</HI> had b&eacute;ene &s;laine by treachery. The nobles beholding this &s;udden accident, came and beheld the &s;ame, euery one imediatly iudging, that by that wound he recea|ued his death. The Duke aboue all others &s;&eacute;emed mo&s;t to wounder h&eacute;ereat, and at length turning to the company, &s;ayd, that he hoped to find out the murtherers, &s;&eacute;eing God &s;o &s;trangely had giuen knowledge of the d&eacute;ede, which vntill now was not &s;o much as once dreampt of.</P>
<P>Wherefore pre&s;ently cau&s;ing <HI>Vitella,</HI> with all her Dam|&s;ells and attendants to be atached, he examined them eue|ry one, and comming to <HI>E&s;tonio,</HI> whom hee before had in|&s;tructed, examined him in &s;uch &s;ort, that he declared how that the Lady <HI>Vitilla,</HI> had many times made proffer of her loue vnto him, and that he as often had denied her, becau&s;e he would not wronge his Lord and Mai&s;ter: how that &s;he had proffered him, both to murder her hu&s;band, and after|wards to marry with him, if he thereunto would giue his con&s;ent: &s;till clearing him&s;elfe as much as it was po&s;&s;ible. This confe&s;&s;ion being vttered, &s;hee poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady was foorthwith condemned, not being &s;uffered &s;o much as once to &s;peake for her &s;elfe, <HI>E&s;tonio</HI> was likewi&s;e commit|ted to pri&s;on: there for to remaine a while to bl&eacute;ere y^e peo|ples eyes, who could hardly belieue that, which hee had iu&s;tified.</P>
<PB REF="40">
<P>The &s;ame day the Duke proc&eacute;eded in iudgement, a|gain&s;t <HI>Vitella,</HI> where he iudged her for her fault, to loo&s;e all her lands, which he imediatly &s;ea&s;ed on, and that except within &s;ixe months, &s;he could find a Knight y^t &s;hould main|taine her cau&s;e, again&s;t y^e Duke in &s;ingle combat: for he as a d&eacute;ere friend vnto her dea&s;ed hu&s;band, would be the man that would prooue that &s;he had comitted trea&s;on, and mur|der again&s;t him, with the&s;e conditions, that if he were van|qui&s;hed, that then &s;he &s;hould be deliuered fr&eacute;e, and all her lands and goods re&s;tored vnto her, but if it hapne~d that he remained Victor, that both &s;hee and the weake Knight, which &s;hould put him&s;elfe in her defence, &s;hould be burned a liue at one &s;take, which he cau&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e to be &s;et vp in the mid&s;t of the Market place.</P>
<P>This &s;entence pronounced, &s;he good Lady was commit|ted vnder &s;afe k&eacute;eping: no body but &s;uch whom the Duke appointed, being &s;uffered to come vnto her. Which cau&s;ed many to iudge the Duke rather to be guilty then &s;he, e&s;pe|cially &s;uch who had knowne the great loue betw&eacute;ene her, and her decea&s;ed hu&s;band: con&s;idering al&s;o, that onely by this meanes he had gotten her inhearitance into his hands, which was the chiefe&s;t marke he aimed at.</P>
<P>Now to returne againe to our purpo&s;e, the Lord <HI>Gwal|tero</HI> and his company, comming as before wee haue &s;aid into <HI>Viena,</HI> hapned to take vp his lodging in a kin&s;mans hou&s;e of the Lady <HI>Vitellas,</HI> who (by rea&s;on of her mi&s;hap) was very &s;ad &amp; pen&s;iue: and b&eacute;eing &s;itting at &s;upper, was demaunded the cau&s;e of his &s;orrow by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> vnto whom hee declared the former di&s;cour&s;e, with the loue of the Duke vnto <HI>Vitella,</HI> which he had likewi&s;e learned of her, not forgetting in any one poynt, to declare the co~mon wickedne&s;&s;e of the Duke, therby the ea&s;ier to per&s;wade his crime likewi&s;e in this.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> hauing attentiuely li&s;tned vnto this di&s;cour&s;e, meruailed greatly at the &s;trange tyranny of the Duke, and b&eacute;eing halfe re&s;olued of the Ladies innocencie, determined with him&s;elfe, to put him&s;elfe in her defence, wherefore de|maunding
<PB REF="41"> how hee might come to &s;peake with the Ladie, and al&s;o, how n&eacute;ere the time appointed for her execution was expired, (for that he was loth to tarry ouer-long in a|ny place, becau&s;e of his returne vnto his Lady &amp; Mi&s;tri&s;&s;e) his Ho&s;t replied, that the time of her death was now with|in &s;ixe dayes, and that as yet &s;hee was not prouided of any Champion, becau&s;e y^e Duke was a &s;trong pui&s;&s;ant knight, and the condition of the combat &s;uch, that euery one fea|red to entermedle therein: and as touching the meanes to &s;peake with her, if he would vouch&s;afe to take the paynes, he would (&s;upper b&eacute;eing ended) conduct him to the place, where hee &s;hould from her owne mouth, heare what &s;hee would &s;ay to cl&eacute;ere her&s;elfe. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> b&eacute;eing by nature pit|tifull, and al&s;o by oath of Knight-hood bound to helpe, and &s;uccour tho&s;e that were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, con&s;ented to goe with him to the pri&s;on. Where b&eacute;eing come, and brought into the pre&s;ence of <HI>Vitella,</HI> her Co&s;in declared the cau&s;e of their comming, who after thanks to them giuen, and lifting vp both her eyes and hands towards heauen, prote&s;ting her innocencie, &s;he declared as much as &s;he knew touching the &s;ame, vtterly denying any loue towards <HI>E&s;tinio,</HI> or any o|ther, &s;aue onely her Lord <HI>Ho&s;tinius. Gwaltero</HI> being fully re&s;olued of her innocencie, demaunded if &s;he would put her ca&s;e into his hands, who would for her deliuery aduenture his life, and no doubt but her cau&s;e b&eacute;eing iu&s;t, God would pro&s;per theyr quarrell. Sh&eacute;e humbly thanking him, an&s;we|red, that &s;&eacute;eing he &s;o curteou&s;ly offered him&s;elfe, to him and God onely &s;he committed her ca&s;e: de&s;iring, that according to her innocencie he might &s;p&eacute;ed therein, and no otherwi&s;e. Then taking theyr leaue, till the day came he departed, lea|uing her &s;omewhat comforted with hope of her Knights good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and equitie of her cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. How <HI>Gwaltero</HI> combatted with the Duke, and &s;lew him, &amp; of the kind proffers that were made him by <HI>&V;itella</HI> &amp; the Nobility, with his departure thence.</HEAD>
<P>_THE day b&eacute;eing come, wherin the Lady <HI>Vi|tella</HI> was either to bring foorth her Champi|on, or el&s;e to commit her body to the fire, the Duke b&eacute;eing royallie accompaned, entred the Li&s;ts, cau&s;ing her in continent to be &s;ent for, and b&eacute;eing come, demaunded for her Champion, &s;h&eacute;e aun&s;wered, that God had prouided her one, who at y^e &s;ound of the trumpet would likewi&s;e appeare. The Duke hea|ring that &s;h&eacute;e was prouided of a Knight, wondred what he &s;hould be, and b&eacute;eing prickt in con&s;cience with the guilt of his fault, grew halfe into di&s;paire, and would willinglie (if it might haue b&eacute;en with his honour) haue de&s;i&s;ted from the Combat. But God who hardned the hart of <HI>Pharao,</HI> like|wi&s;e hardned his, thereby the more euidently to make knowne vnto the world, his mercy and louing kindnes, to|wards them that feare him, and his iu&s;tice on them, which again&s;t their owne con&s;ciences commit &s;inne and iniquitie. So that cau&s;ing fir&s;t the Lady to be conuayed towards the &s;take, the trumpets were &s;ounded, but no Knight was &s;&eacute;en to approch, which cau&s;ed him to grow more proude and in|&s;olent, thinking then, that no man dared to combat again&s;t him. But at the &s;econd warning the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> appea|red, mounted on a mighty Cour&s;er, with his Launce on his thigh, and his Helmet on: in this &s;ort came hee before the Iudges, and lifting vp his beuer, made a little &s;hew of reuerence, then proc&eacute;eding on with his &s;p&eacute;ech, he &s;aid, that b&eacute;eing accepted of <HI>Vitella</HI> as her Knight, hee was come to defend her innocencie: and that he marueiled, that they be|ing appointed Iudges of the fielde, would contrary to all rea&s;on, &s;end her towards the place of execution, before the Combat were ended: then de&s;iring that &s;he might again be
<PB REF="42"> &s;ent for, he held his peace: which they foorthwith cau&s;ed to be done, placing her whereas &s;he might behold the i&s;&s;ue of the battell. In the meane time, the Duke comming vnto <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> demaunded what, and of whence hee was, who aun&s;wered, that he was a Knight arrant, of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through his Country, had heard of his cruelty &s;hewed vnto the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady, and b&eacute;eing mooued with pitty, was come to vndertake her defence, which he hoped &s;o well to performe, as before night to cau&s;e him confe&s;&s;e his trea&s;on again&s;t her. The Duke raging hereat, replied, that doubtle&s;&s;e he was &s;ome one of her Mi|nions, that b&eacute;eing weary of his life, was come for compa|ny to be burnt with her, which &s;hould be performed with all the torments that might be.</P>
<P>Now by this time <HI>Vitella</HI> b&eacute;eing brought backe and pla|ced, the Iudges cau&s;ed both Knights to be &s;worne, then be|ing warned by a Herault euery one to doe his be&s;t, they &s;et &s;purres to theyr hor&s;es, and incountred &s;o rudely, that the Duke was throwne out of his &s;addle, b&eacute;eing wounded a little vnder the right brea&s;t, and &s;ore bru&s;ed with the fall, <HI>Gwaltero</HI> was not wounded at all, but yet by rea&s;on of the mightine&s;&s;e of the encounter, his hor&s;ebacke brake vnder him, wherefore he was in like &s;ort driuen to alight, and be|ing both on foote, they began a cruell and fierce fight, clea|uing their &s;hields, and hewing their armor in p&eacute;eces, &s;o that euery blow cau&s;ed the blood to trickle downe, dying the gr&eacute;ne gra&s;&s;e into a &s;carlet hue. Thus continued the fight a long time very vncertaine, no man knowing to who~ vic|tory would incline: &s;ome-whiles the one tryumphing in the others lo&s;&s;e, and by and by againe, the other reioycing to &s;&eacute;e his enemy &s;toope. Thus continued they the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e houres, the beholders meruailing they could indure &s;o long: at length &s;tanding to breathe them&s;elues, the Duke &s;pake vnto him, &s;aying, Knight, thou &s;&eacute;e&s;t that as yet I haue the aduantage, but the great vallour which I haue found in th&eacute;e, makes me to pitty thy e&s;tate, wherefore I am con|tented to remit th&eacute;e the Combat, conditionally that y^u wilt
<PB REF="42"> remaine with mee, and al&s;o I will giue vnto th&eacute;e halfe of her lands whom thou defende&s;t. Nay, nay, replied <HI>Gwal|tero,</HI> I &s;corne thy proffers, but if thou wilt re&s;tore the La|dy and her goods, and confe&s;&s;e h&eacute;ere before this company, thy trea&s;on committed again&s;t her, I will grant thee thy life: otherwi&s;e looke for no mercy at my hands. Then ta|king theyr &s;words in their hands, and couering them&s;elues with the remnants of their &s;hields, they fell againe to their former conflict, which co~tinued not long before that <HI>Gwal|tero</HI> deliuered a mighty blowe on his head, which cleft his Helme in two, and wounded him &s;o &s;ore that hee fell to the ground, which <HI>Gwaltero</HI> &s;&eacute;eing, &s;tept vnto him, and would haue &s;laine him out-right, had not he intreated mercy, pro|mi&s;ing to confe&s;&s;e the whole circum&s;tance of the trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Then the Iudges co~ming vnto him, hee confe&s;t fir&s;t his loue to <HI>Vitella,</HI> then the murder of <HI>Ho&s;tinius,</HI> and la&s;tly his hate towards her for refu&s;ing him, from whence grew this manner of reuenge which be intended.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he made his confe&s;&s;ion, but turning about his face he immediatly dyed. Then the Iudges cau&s;ed his body to be carried away, to the intent to haue him interred, but they were &s;aued of that labour, for a flock of Wolues comming from out of the woods there adioyning, deuou|red his accur&s;ed carka&s;&s;e, to the great admiration of all the beholders. Then immediatly was, <HI>Vitella</HI> brought downe, and greatly honored, and <HI>E&s;tonio</HI> being apprehended, was burned in the fire prepared for his Lady. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> b&eacute;eing conducted to his lodging by the Nobility and <HI>Vitella,</HI> was by them vnarmed, &amp; his wounds very carefully looked vn|to, where hee remained the &s;pace of eyght w&eacute;ekes, during which time hee had many great pro&s;fers made him by <HI>Vi|tella,</HI> as the inioying both of her&s;elfe, &amp; all her inheritance, and by the Nobilitie hee was proffered to be accepted as theyr &s;oueraigne Prince and Duke, if &s;o be hee would ac|cept of <HI>Vitella</HI> to be his wife. But hee who had &s;etled his minde in another place, gaue the~ all harty thanks for theyr good wills towards him, excu&s;ing him&s;elfe as well as hee
<PB REF="43"> might, and de&s;iring them to be&s;towe it on &s;ome one more worthy then him&s;elfe, with whom <HI>Vitella</HI> might be coupled in marriage. Thus excu&s;ing him&s;elfe from receiuing that which mo&s;t men would haue coueted, hee remained there till his wou~ds were throughly whole, then taking his leaue of <HI>Vitella</HI> and the re&s;t, he departed towards the confines of <HI>Belgica,</HI> hauing receiued of <HI>Vitella</HI> both hor&s;e and Armor, for a remembrance of her, in &s;teed of his owne, which in the battell again&s;t the Duke was broken and &s;poyled.</P>

<P>_THus being departed from <HI>Viena,</HI> hee was accompanied by diuers of the Nobilitie, till &s;uch time as pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> hee directed his iourny towardes <HI>Flaunders:</HI> at which time the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> commending him to God, and de&s;iring him at his returne to come that way, they departed a|gaine towards <HI>Viena,</HI> by whom <HI>Gwaltero</HI> commended to <HI>Vitella.</HI> In this &s;ort being departed, hee rode onwards towards <HI>Flaunders,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elfe, becau&s;e he would not be knowne in that Country, where he was beloued of many: at la&s;t comming to the Citty of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> he found it &s;till defended, and kept vnder the Subiection of the <HI>Danes,</HI> there likewi&s;e he heard of the cu&s;tome of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cor|uew,</HI> in the Duchie of <HI>Holland,</HI> made by the Duke <HI>Griffo|ry.</HI> Which was (that who&s;oeuer would enter y^e &s;ayd Ca&s;tle) mu&s;t fir&s;t alone Iu&s;t with the fiue Knights, who kept the foote of the bridge, one after another, and if it were his hap to ouercome them all, then was he to Iu&s;t al&s;o with the o|ther fiue: fir&s;t with two at once, then again&s;t the other thr&eacute;e, but and if it were his fortune likewi&s;e to vanqui&s;h them, then was h&eacute;e to fight with the other 40, by fiue, &amp; by

But if it &s;o hapned that the &s;traunge Knight, were by them ouercome, then to loo&s;e both his hor&s;e and Armor, and &s;o to depart: vnle&s;&s;e it were &s;uch a one whom they knew to be their enemy, and then was he &s;ure to be impri|&s;oned. This cu&s;tome he ray&s;ed, becau&s;e thereby he hoped to impri&s;on as many of the <HI>Danske</HI> Knights, as &s;hould pa&s;&s;e that way in &s;earch of their King.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> hearing of this cu&s;tome, and being de&s;irous to &s;&eacute;e the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the place (&s;o much &s;poken of, together, imagining that peraduenture their King might be there impri&s;oned, as ind&eacute;ede he was) minded to goe &s;&eacute;e the &s;ame, and then if his minde &s;erued him, to make triall of the aduenture. Thus being re&s;olued, he &s;ecretly depar|ted <HI>Gaunt,</HI> accompanied only with his Squire, leauing be|hind him both Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> and <HI>Cadrus,</HI> not knowing what was become of him: in this &s;ort he &s;haped his cour&s;e the next way thetherwards, where the tenth day after he arri|ued, about nine of the clocke in the morning: and comming to a &s;hield that hunge on a Tr&eacute;e thereby, &s;trake the &s;ame &s;o hard, that the whole Ca&s;tle re&s;ounded thereof. Then came foorth the fir&s;t fiue Knights, one of them demaunding what he &s;ought: <HI>Gwaltero</HI> told him he would very willing|ly enter the Ca&s;tle, to behold whether it were &s;o faire with|in, as it &s;howed beautiful without. Yea replied the Knight, but fir&s;t you mu&s;t according to our cu&s;tome Iu&s;t with me, and my fellowes, whom except you ouercome, you are not like to gaine entrance: I haue heard (replied he) if I be not deceaued, your cu&s;tome, which maketh me &s;omething the more de&s;irous to enter, in regard I thinke that a place &s;o fenced &amp; defended without, cannot chu&s;e but haue things worth the beholding within: wherefore I am contented to make triall of my fortune, by the &s;trength of my arme. Then couching their Launces, they two ranne together &s;o fiercely, that the Knight of the Ca&s;tle was tumbled head|long ouer his hor&s;e taile, not being able to ri&s;e againe, by rea&s;on of the weight of his Armor, which &s;o &s;ore bru&s;ed him
<PB REF="44"> in his fall. Then ranne another of the Knights, but for ha&s;t mi&s;&s;ed his cour&s;e: but <HI>Gwaltero</HI> beeing more circom&s;pect, in hauing a great deale of worke to doe, met him &s;o rightly, that his Launce pa&s;&s;ed through his body aboue a yard, cau&s;ing him to fall dead to the ground: then his Squire brought him the Launce of the dead Knight, with which he met the third &s;o &s;oundly, that he &s;ent both hor&s;e and man to the ground, wherehence he was not able to ari&s;e in ha&s;t, by rea&s;on that both his f&eacute;ete were &s;o fa&s;tned in his &s;tirrups, y^t hee could not cl&eacute;ere him&s;elfe, but lay &s;till vnder his hor&s;e, which &s;triuing to get vp, had almo&s;t &s;qui&s;ed out his Mai|&s;ters breath. The fourth who&s;e turne was next to runne, knew not well what to do, for willingly he would haue de|&s;i&s;ted fro~ that carrere, but being a&s;hamed to &s;how him&s;elfe &s;o cowardly: he likewi&s;e &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, but in y^e en|counter was &s;ent to beare his fellowes companie. The fift had &s;omewhat better lucke then y^e re&s;t, for at the fir&s;t cour&s;e he was not not di&s;mounted, by rea&s;on <HI>Gwalteros</HI> hor&s;e be|ing wearied with his former trauell, euen as they came to meet, &s;tumbled vnder him, whereby he mi&s;t his cour&s;e, the other breaking his &s;peare in the mid&s;t of his &s;hield, pa&s;t on without doing any farther hurt: then taking a new Launce they ranne againe, where the &s;econd time <HI>Gwalte|ro</HI> met him &s;o directly, that ca&s;ting him out of his Saddle backwards, hee pitched on the ground with his head for|wards, falling &s;o heauie that hee brake his necke withall. The~ <HI>Gwaltero</HI> alighting, made choi&s;e of y^e be&s;t of their hor|&s;es, &amp; mounting thereon came to the bridge foote, where h&eacute;e found great &s;tore of Launces, &amp; making choi&s;e of y^e be&s;t, he deliuered a couple vnto his Squire, to k&eacute;epe for him if occa|&s;ion &s;erued. Now by this time were two of the other fiue on hor&s;e-backe, prouiding them&s;elues for the Iu&s;t: and all the re&s;t of the Knights of the Ca&s;tle, were gathered toge|ther on the battlements, to behold the i&s;&s;ue of the battaile: arming them&s;elues likewi&s;e, who &s;hould be the next fiue. Thus the two Knights being mounted and furni&s;hed at all points, cried vnto <HI>Gwaltero</HI> to defend him&s;elfe: then pla|cing their Launces in their re&s;ts, and &s;etting &s;purres to
<PB REF="44"> their hor&s;es, they ranne together with all their force, brea|king their &s;taues in the mid&s;t of his &s;hield, with &s;uch might, that they cau&s;ed his hor&s;e to &s;tagger backwards, hauing much adoe to recouer him&s;elfe from falling, but he him&s;elfe &s;&eacute;emed to moue no more, the~ if they had runne again&s;t &s;ome huge Oke, but his &s;troke was not to &s;o &s;mall purpo&s;e, for charging his Lance again&s;t him on his right &s;ide, gaue him &s;uch a &s;ound blow, that piercing both his &s;hield and armor, the &s;peares head entred cleane through his hart, cau&s;ing him to fall as dead as a dogge to the ground. Then turning about (their cour&s;e b&eacute;eing ended) demaunded whether h&eacute;e mu&s;t iu&s;t with the other Knight againe, and they an&s;wered yes: then calling to his Squire to bring him another lance, they ranne againe, where the other Knight was forced to mea&s;ure his length on the ground, bearing his &s;addle be|tw&eacute;ene his legges.</P>
<P>Then againe changing his hor&s;e, hee prouided him&s;elfe again&s;t the other thr&eacute;e, who b&eacute;eing all mounted on verie good hor&s;es, charged him at once, two of them breaking theyr &s;taues on his &s;hield, and the other mi&s;&s;ing his cour&s;e, was &s;ent headlong to the ground for beeing ouer ha&s;tie.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> b&eacute;eing &s;ore &s;haken with that incounter, could haue b&eacute;ene contented to haue giuen ouer running for that time, but yet b&eacute;eing compelled to it by rea&s;on of the cu|&s;tome, tooke a fre&s;h Launce in hand, and there-with met one of them &s;o right, that for euer after he made him &s;ure e|nough for running. The other perceiuing his fellowes to be &s;laine, and that no force was able to preuaile again&s;t him, determined at the next cour&s;e to kill his hor&s;e vnder him, hoping thereby to &s;aue him&s;elfe from the &s;troke of his Launce: and b&eacute;eing thus re&s;olued, ranne againe, direc|ting the poynt of his Launce full again&s;t <HI>Gwalteros</HI> hor&s;e bre&s;t, where entring, he &s;lew the hor&s;e, but e&s;caped not him &s;elfe &s;o well as he hoped for, by rea&s;on that the hor&s;e com|ming &s;o fiercely, gaue &s;omething backe, but brought his Mai&s;ter &s;o n&eacute;ere him, that he &s;trooke him full in the fight of the Helme, and the barre b&eacute;eing weake, gaue pa&s;&s;age for
<PB REF="45"> the &s;peare to his braines, &s;o that they fell to the ground both together. And <HI>Gwaltero</HI> cl&eacute;ering his f&eacute;et out of the &s;tirrups, lightly recouered him&s;elfe againe, and adre&s;&s;ing his &s;hielde on his arme, with his &s;word in his hand, hee marched to|wards the Ca&s;tle gate, minding (&s;&eacute;eing that he had proc&eacute;e|ded &s;o farre) either to enter, or die in the pur&s;ute. But be|fore hee was come fully to the entrance, the fiue Knights, who were appointed to combat fir&s;t with him, came foorth, and all at once a&s;&s;aulted him: then beganne there a mo&s;t fierce and bloody fight, very hard and vnequall, by rea&s;on they b&eacute;eing fiue, and he but one, and al&s;o before ouerlabo|red with his former trauell, was not able to doe as other|wi&s;e he would: yet notwith&s;tanding, he layd on &s;uch cruel blowes, that euery one iudged him&s;elfe happie&s;t when as he was farthe&s;t from him, the lookers on admiring how it was po&s;&s;ible for one alone Knight, to &s;hewe &s;uch prowe&s;&s;e, as by defending him&s;elfe again&s;t &s;o many, but at la&s;t being ouer|wearied, &amp; wounded in many places, hauing lo&s;t much of his blood, was forced through faintnes to fal to the ground, hauing before his fall &s;laine two of them out-right, and very &s;orely wounded the others, then b&eacute;eing no longer able to re&s;i&s;tance, he was carried pri&s;oner into the Ca&s;tle, where he had his wounds bound vp &amp; dre&s;&s;ed, being pittied of many who had beheld his vallor, but b&eacute;eing cured of his wounds, and examined of whence he was, hee was committed pri&s;o|ner into the dungion where the wofull King lay, thereby thinking the more to grieue him. Who no &s;ooner was let in-the dungion, but they one knew the other, making the grea|te&s;t lamentation and &s;orrow that might be, but at length comforting them&s;elues as well as they might, they made relation of their fortunes each to other, hoping that in time God would &s;end them deliuerance from all theyr troubles. H&eacute;ere will we leaue them, to tell a little what hapned in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> through the mallice of the Gouer|nours one to another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. How the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> the County <HI>Hermes,</HI> &amp; the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> di&s;liking the gouernment, went about to make a King among&s;t them.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hauing b&eacute;ene without their King, by the &s;pace of 17 yeares, and vnder the gouernment of a certaine company of States, elected as is before declared: many beganne to di&s;|like with y^e gouernment therof, among&s;t whom the chiefe and principall, were the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> a man very well learned, but giuen altogether vnto nouelties and change, the County <HI>Hermes,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> all thr&eacute;e great men, and &s;uch as were in a manner, the only Authors of that go|uernment: and the fir&s;t yeare were them&s;elues chiefe go|uernours in that e&s;tabli&s;hed e&s;tate, as appeareth in the fourth Chapter of this pre&s;ent Booke.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, (al this and their &s;olemne vowes, ratified vnder their hands and &s;eales, for the continuance, and performance of that kind of &s;tate, and gouernment) they were in a manner, the fir&s;t that repined again&s;t it, &s;&eacute;eking by all the meanes they could, to ouerthrow and ex|tingui&s;h the &s;ame, either for the enuy they bare towardes tho&s;e who were Gouernors, or for that them&s;elues had ne|uer &s;ince the fir&s;t yeare hapned to be of the twelue, or el&s;e (and that which I thinke to be mo&s;t likelie&s;t) beeing &s;tir|red vp by the deuill, they de&s;ired greater &s;uperiority, then either became them, or by any waies they were worthy of, yet doubting to agr&eacute;e within them&s;elues, being but thr&eacute;e, hauing the gouernance in their owne hands, determined therefore to elect and chu&s;e a King: who beeing by them &s;o rai&s;ed, could not chu&s;e likewi&s;e but to be rulde by them, and that vnder the cullour of the King, they might reuenge them&s;elues of their enemies: and likewi&s;e preferre their
<PB REF="46"> friends to honor and dignitie. And hauing thus re&s;olued betw&eacute;ene them&s;elues, they &s;olicited the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> King to ac|cept of the Diadem, promi&s;ing him by their letters, that if he would but &s;end ouer tenne thou&s;and Souldiers, vnder the conduct of &s;ome expert Leader or Captaine, that then they would &s;o ayde him, that in le&s;&s;e then a yeare, he &s;hould haue all <HI>Denmarke</HI> in his &s;ubiection: conditionally, that they thr&eacute;e might continually haue and inioy to them&s;elues, the chiefe offices belonging to that Kingdome.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> King (harkning vnto this iolly proffer) at the fir&s;t made &s;mall account thereof: but afterwards way|ing with him&s;elfe the great benefits and proffits, which thereby might ri&s;e, not onely to him: but to all his King|dome and Subiects, if he might &s;o ea&s;ily obtaine the &s;ame, as in their letters they made &s;howe of: and beeing againe by them &s;olicited anew, writing vnto him in their letters, that vnle&s;&s;e he accepted thereof, they would giue it vnto the King of <HI>England,</HI> or &s;ome other Prince, whom they knew would more thankefully accept of their kind offer. The County <HI>Hermes</HI> in a priuate letter be&s;ides, wrote how that if his Maie&s;tie would (hauing conquered the Kingdome) make him Viceroy or Deputy thereof, he would &s;end ouer his elde&s;t &s;onne to remaine as pledge, vntill &s;uch time as he had performed, what&s;oeuer hee made promi&s;e of: and that then he would render him &s;uch tribute, as by his Ma|ie&s;tie &s;hould be thought fit. Now when he had him&s;elfe per|u&s;ed the&s;e letters, (and ca&s;t all doubts he could) he made them knowne to his priuy Coun&s;ell, who after long delibe|ration, at length gaue him this an&s;were, that they were al|&s;o of the minde, his Maie&s;tie &s;hould accept their proffer of the Kingdome a gift well worth the acceptance, and far|ther, to graunt them their owne de&s;ires, in that which they &s;hould demaunde, till &s;uch time as beeing Mai&s;ter of the Country, hee might at his plea&s;ure, then alter any thing that he would. In the meane time, to receaue pledges of their meaning, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e he might repent too late. Thus hauing determined, the King &s;ent ouer &s;ecretly vn|to
<PB REF="46"> them, to certifie them of his intent, a&s;&s;uring each of them the greate&s;t dignities and honor, that the Kingdome would y&eacute;eld: intreating the~ likewi&s;e, to &s;end ouer their Ho&s;tages, vpon who&s;e arriuall his forces &s;hould be ready to be &s;hip|ped, vnder the conduct of his Co&s;en, the Lord <HI>Dougla&s;&s;e,</HI> a man for his experience and vallor excellent.</P>
<P>The&s;e letters being thus &s;ecretly conuaied, were mo&s;t welcome newes vnto tho&s;e arch Traytors to their Coun|try, who foorthwith &s;ent for Ho&s;tages the County <HI>Hermes</HI> his elde&s;t &s;onne, a gallant young youth, and one whom in time might haue prooued an honorable man. The Lord <HI>Harding</HI> had but one only daughter, and her he &s;ent vnder cullour to be brought vp with the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Prince&s;&s;e, &amp; for the Arch Traytor (Archbi&s;hop I would &s;ay) was &s;ent an Nephew of his, an excellent good Scholler, &amp; a notable Pol|litician. The&s;e being &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> they appointed the Kings forces to be ready by the tenth of May then next in|&s;uing: and they in the meane time made all the proui&s;ion that might be, where we will likewi&s;e leaue them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of a &s;trange aduenture hapning in the Court of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and how the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, and <HI>Iago</HI> were Knigh|ted, and how the aduenture was ended.</HEAD>
<P>_THere was in the Kingdome of <HI>Spaine,</HI> a noble man called <HI>Segnior Adre&s;to,</HI> famous for his vertues and Chiualry: and hauing pa&s;&s;ed o|uer a great part of the world, in &s;&eacute;eking and following of &s;trange aduentures, alwaies hauing fortu|nate &s;ucce&s;&s;e in all his enterpri&s;es, e&s;pecially in his loue, which hee bare towards a noble Lady of his owne Coun|try, called <HI>Leonarda,</HI> daughter and &s;ole heyre vnto y^e Duke of <HI>Tolledo:</HI> one who for beauty and comline&s;&s;e of body, was the only paragon of all <HI>Spaine,</HI> &s;ought vnto by many, but only inioyed by <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> betw&eacute;ene whom there grew &s;o great loue, that who&s;oeuer had &s;&eacute;ene or knowne the &s;ame,
<PB REF="47"> would haue &s;worne, that then loue there had b&eacute;ene no grea|ter dietie. Which when the Duke her father vnder&s;toode, being loth to match her vnto one of &s;o meane e&s;tate, al|though for his vertues he might compare with any, yet was his liuings very &s;mall: therefore he often warned her to auoyd his company, and at length grew in great di&s;plea|&s;ure w^t her, threatning to di&s;inherit her, if &s;he did not obey vnto his will h&eacute;erein. Which the young Lady doubting, at their next m&eacute;eting, made him priuy withall, a&s;&s;uring him that for his loue &s;he could be contented to for&s;ake all. But yet &s;&eacute;eing that in time her fathers good will might bee ob|tained, &s;he would intreate him for a while to ab&s;ence him|&s;elfe: a&s;&s;uring him, that for her part, &s;he would alwaies continue faithfull and con&s;tant vnto him, and neuer accept of any other hu&s;band, though thereby &s;he were di&s;inherited. <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> hearing her kind and louing &s;p&eacute;eches, aun&s;wered, that &s;&eacute;eing it was her plea&s;ure, he was contented, although to be out of her pre&s;ence would bee a hell vnto him: and whereas &s;h&eacute;e had made him &s;o fr&eacute;e a graunt of her loue, he prote&s;ted before the heauens likewi&s;e neuer to for&s;ake her, and that before he would con&s;ent to loue any other the~ her|&s;elfe, he would be torne to p&eacute;eces with wilde hor&s;es: then deliuering each other a&s;igne of their pa&s;&s;ed faiths, he depar|ted. And within &s;hort time after left the Kingdome, trauel|ling many &s;trange and vnknowne Regions, till at la&s;t comming into the Kings of <HI>Ireland,</HI> hee hapned to fall in likingly with a beautifull Dam&s;ell of that Country, but of meane parentage: her father being but a Marchant of that Country. On whom he &s;o doted, that he had cleane forgot|ten, and for&s;aken the cha&s;t and vertuous Lady <HI>Lenarda:</HI> although the good Lady hauing intelligence h&eacute;ereof, by a friend of hers, a &s;kilfull Magitian, oft times &s;ent vnto him, to cau&s;e him to call to minde his former loue. At length the Duke her father dying, and leauing her &s;ole Mi&s;tirs and Dutches of his Dukedome, &s;hee hauing with great pompe &amp; &s;olemnitie celebrated his funerals, one day &s;ent for her friend the Magitian to come vnto hor, of whom &s;he demaunded if there were no meanes, to recall her louer
<PB REF="47"> <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> againe, without whom &s;he was like to &s;pend her life time in care and heauine&s;&s;e. <HI>Adriano,</HI> (for &s;o the Magi|tian was called) made her aun&s;were, that he could not di|rectly aun&s;were her demaunde: becau&s;e that &s;he (whom he &s;o loued) wore alwaies on her finger a Ring, which was the only &s;tay of his loue, which except they could get from her, it was impo&s;&s;ible, euer to remooue his affection. Al&s;o this Ring had one other vertue, which was that who&s;oe|uer did weare it, &s;hould not loo&s;e &s;o much as a drop of blood in any battaile what&s;oeuer: wherefore when he combatted with any one, (as oft times he did for her loue,) then had he the Ring. And vnle&s;&s;e there could be found a Knight, that might by force conquer him in &s;ingle battaile, and take away the Ring from him, it was impo&s;&s;ible to get the &s;ame by any deceit what&s;oeuer. <HI>Lenarda</HI> hearing this, was as one halfe be&s;ides her&s;elfe, but being comforted by <HI>Adriano,</HI> (who a&s;&s;ured her he would trie the vttermo&s;t of his &s;kill to find out the Knight, as he had &s;poken of.) Then taking his leaue of her, he returned home: where by his art he framed a mo&s;t rich and faire &s;word, excellent curious to the eye, and to cut, the be&s;t that was then in the whole world: this &s;word he inchaunted in &s;uch &s;ort, that no man but h&eacute;e to whom the conque&s;t of <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> appertained, might drawe the &s;ame: then bringing it to <HI>Lenarda,</HI> willed her to &s;end one of her Squires therwith, to &s;&eacute;eke out the Knight who &s;hould by his vallor recouer her loue: then deliuering it to one of her Squires, whom &s;he e&s;t&eacute;emed for his truth and &s;ecricie, with this commaunde, that who&s;oeuer &s;hould offer to draw foorth y^e &s;word, &s;hould fir&s;t make promi&s;e of a boone, which was to goe ouer into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to combat with <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> accu&s;ing him for falcifying of his faith to <HI>Lenarda.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Squire (hauing the &s;word) trauelled to all the Princes Courts in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and Countries thereabouts: then into <HI>Fraunce, Italie,</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> neuer finding any one that could once mooue it in the Scaberd: although ma|ny &s;tout &amp; hardy Knights made triall thereof, to this great griefe, fearing his trauell &s;hould neuer haue end, nor his Lady ea&s;e of her &s;orrowe. In this manner hauing trauel|led
<PB REF="48"> through mo&s;t part of <HI>Germanie:</HI> he arriued at the Court of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> de&s;iring the Duke y^t his Knights might make triall, if it were any their fortunes to accompli&s;h that, for which hee had trauailed &s;he greate&s;t part of Chri&s;tendome. Then &s;hewing his &s;word, hee declared, that bearing the &s;ame a whole yeere, he could neuer finde any one y^t might draw the &s;ame. The Duke wondring h&eacute;ereat, immediatly after Dinner, cau&s;ed all his Knights to make triall therof, him&s;elfe b&eacute;eing the fir&s;t, but al to no end applyed they their forces. Which when the young Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> and the Gen|tleman of the Forre&s;t beheld, they pre&s;ently fell on theyr kn&eacute;es before the Duke, de&s;iring his grace to grant them the order of knight-hood, hoping that for one of them this Aduenture was re&s;erued.</P>
<P>The Duke b&eacute;eing vnwilling at the fir&s;t, by rea&s;on of their young age, that b&eacute;eing knighted, they would hazard them&s;elues in &s;&eacute;eking after &s;trange aduentures, adui&s;ed them to &s;tay a y&eacute;ere or two more, before they tooke &s;o wai|tie a charge on them: affirming that it was vnlawfull to dubbe any one, before the age of twenty, at which time they would be &s;trong, and able to indure the weight of their Ar|mour and trauell, and not before. All which could not cau&s;e them to de&s;i&s;t from theyr &s;ute, but &s;till more earne&s;tlie they craued the &s;ame, alleaging many &s;undry examples of tho&s;e who at younger y&eacute;eres had inured them&s;elues to as great labours, as <HI>Reynaldo</HI> at the age of fift&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres &s;tealing from his fathers court, went into <HI>Pale&s;tina</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Armie, where vnder great <HI>Godfry</HI> of <HI>Bullen,</HI> he obtained to be the chiefe &s;courge to the Sara&s;ins, and without whom, it had b&eacute;ene impo&s;&s;ible to haue wonne the holy Citty of <HI>Ie|ru&s;alem.</HI> This and many other &s;uch like arguments they alleaged, wherby at length they obtained the Duke to con|&s;ent vnto them: willing them for that night, according to the auncient cu&s;tome, to watch in the Chappell. Then tur|ning to the Squire, hee intreated him to tarry till the next day, &s;&eacute;eing the two young Gentlemen were &s;o de&s;irous. The Squire, to &s;ati&s;-fie the Duke, willingly con&s;ented, al|though
<PB REF="48"> he had no great hope of theyr &s;ucce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The two Princes carefull of their charge, hauing theyr Armor and other nece&s;&s;aries prouided, kept theyr deuout watch all night, &s;ometimes accompanied by the young Prince&s;&s;e, and diuers other Ladies, they pa&s;&s;ed away the time till the morning: at what time the Duke co~ming vn|to them, accompanied with many Lords &amp; Knights, with his owne hands buckled on theyr &s;purres, and then draw|ing foorth their &s;words, gaue them the gentle <HI>Accolado.</HI> Then ray&s;ing them vp, de&s;ired GOD to make them both good and valiant Knights. Then hearing deuine &s;eruice, they returned into the great Hall, to make triall of the in|chaunted Sword, where fir&s;t the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> as the elder, made tryall, but by no meanes was able to draw it, then taking it to the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, he &s;aid, Brother God giue you better luck then I, or el&s;e this Squire is like to indure more labour. True replied he, &amp; I doubt it great|ly, &s;&eacute;eing that you haue mi&s;t: then putting his hands on the Hilts, he drew it foorth as ea&s;ily, as if it had b&eacute;ene an ordi|nary &s;word, to the great wonder of the Duke, and all the beholders. Then the Squire falling on his knees, tolde him, that the boone which he required, was to goe into <HI>Ire|land</HI> with him, where he &s;hould combat with a Knight, b&eacute;e|ing the fal&s;e&s;t Louer that might be: and therewith declared the whole di&s;cour&s;e of his Lady and <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> as is before recited.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. How <HI>Euordanus</HI> called the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, hauing receaued order of Knighthood, departed towards <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Squire of <HI>Lenarda,</HI> Dutches of <HI>Toledo.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_YOu may remember, how that in the former part of this hi&s;torie, the young Princes <HI>E|uordanus</HI> and <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing receaued the or|der of Knighthoode, and the aduenture of the inchaunted &s;word, being fini&s;hed by <HI>Euor|danus,</HI> he was thereupon to trauell into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to combat with <HI>Adre&s;to:</HI> and now hauing &s;tayed by the Duke and Dutches intreaty, &s;ome thr&eacute;e or foure daies, in which time there was a &s;mall Barke prepared, for his better tran&s;por|ting him&s;elfe, and &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as in his iourny &s;hould be n&eacute;edefull vnto him: and now the winde &s;eruing fitly for their intended cour&s;e, he was ha&s;tned on by the Squire to depart, who declared vnto him the great griefe and hea|uines, which in this meane time his noble and excellent Lady the Dutches <HI>Lenarda</HI> indured, then which h&eacute;e was &s;ure there could be no greater torment po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>And now all things b&eacute;eing fitted in readine&s;&s;e for their departure, hee came before the Duke to take his leaue, where falling downe on his kn&eacute;es, proffering to ki&s;&s;e his graces hands, the Duke lift him vp from the ground, im|bracing him in his armes, and with teares trickling downe
<PB REF="50"> his manly ch&eacute;ekes commended him to God, de&s;iring him that he would returne againe vnto his Court his aduen|ture being fini&s;hed, with as much &s;p&eacute;ede as might bee, whereas he &s;hould be as hartily welcome, as his owne na|tural &s;on y^e prince <HI>Iago.</HI> The&s;e &amp; many other &s;uch like &s;p&eacute;e|ches the Duke then v&s;ed vnto him, which draue the Knight into a great admiration, e&s;pecially of the words that h&eacute;e &s;hould be as welcome vnto him, as the Prince <HI>Iago.</HI> By which and the &s;trange name he was called by, it was to be doubted whether hee were the Dukes &s;onne or not: which before this time he had neuer heard, nor &s;o much as once dreampt of, &s;o &s;ecret had his finding b&eacute;ene con&s;ealed from him. And being about to demaunde the &s;ame of the Duke, he was put from his purpo&s;e by a me&s;&s;enger, which was &s;ent vnto him by the Dutches, to will him to come vnto her in her chamber: where hearing of his taking leaue of the Duke, &s;he attended his comming, being accompani|ed with her daughter the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> who was now attained to the age of 15 yeares, and by continuall frequenting the company of the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, &s;omewhat touched with loue towards him, and vnder&s;tan|ding by her mother (who de&s;ired nothing more then to &s;&eacute;e them ioyned together in marriage) that they were no kin, had &s;et downe her re&s;t, if he thereto con&s;ented, to accept of no other hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Thus leauing the Duke, not a little grieued for his de|parture, he came vnto the Dutches her chamber, where as he found both the mother and daughter, &s;o ouercharged with &s;orrow for his departure: that of a long time they were not able to vtter a word. But at length the Dutches, recouering the former v&s;e of her tongue, with a d&eacute;epe &s;igh proc&eacute;eding from her hart, which manife&s;tly &s;howed the in|ward griefe, &s;he &s;u&s;tained for his departure, and with her eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed on him, &s;pake as followeth.</P>
<P>Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, for &s;onne I may no longer call you: the great loue which I haue alwaies borne vnto you, I am &s;ure you know to be no le&s;&s;e then that, either to
<PB REF="50"> your &s;uppo&s;ed brother the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> or your &s;i&s;ter <HI>E|gi&s;ena,</HI> although as by my former &s;p&eacute;eches, you may per|ceaue you were not my owne naturall childe, but in your infancy found by my Lord the Duke in a Forre&s;t, in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> of which place you haue e|uer &s;ince b&eacute;ene called the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t: no man knowing of what parentage you are di&s;cended, nor what other name then this, which the Duke gaue you to call you by. The&s;e things I haue now thought good to de|clare vnto you before your departure, that b&eacute;eing ab&s;ent, you may the better if occa&s;ion &s;o happen, to find out your true and naturall parents, whom I doubt not but to be &s;uch as your &s;elfe &s;hall haue no cau&s;e to grieue at, nor we cau&s;e to be &s;orrowfull for the education be&s;towed vpon you, your vertues already manife&s;ting the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Farther would &s;he haue proc&eacute;eded, but the teares trick|ling downe her ch&eacute;ekes, &s;topped the pa&s;&s;age of her farther &s;p&eacute;eches: when the young Knight hauing attentiuely li&s;t|ned vnto her former words, to the which tho&s;e of the Duke &s;&eacute;emed to concure?</P>
<P>Replied, mo&s;t worthy Prince&s;&s;e, the&s;e your &s;p&eacute;eches hath &s;trooke &s;uch an amazedne&s;&s;e into my vnder&s;tanding, that I knowe not well what to &s;peake or thinke, but my vnto|wardline&s;&s;e did alwaies fore&s;howe, that I was not di&s;|cended of &s;o royall an of&s;pring, as my Lord the Duke: yet notwith&s;tanding, my minde foretelleth me, I am not &s;o ba&s;ely de&s;cended, but that I may hope for to challendge my &s;elfe to be a Gentleman: and make knowne this high or|der, which my Lord the Duke hath be&s;towed vpon mee of Knighthoode, not to &s;urpa&s;&s;e my e&s;tate: wherefore I vow and prote&s;t before God, h&eacute;ere in your Graces pre&s;ence, not to re&s;t nor inioy quiet abode in any place, vntill &s;uch time as I haue found out tho&s;e from whom I am de&s;cended. In the meane time, I humbly intreate you to e&s;t&eacute;eme of m&eacute;e, though vnworthily as your faithfull and deuoted &s;eruant: farther de&s;iring y^t Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> to honor me with y^e ti|tle of being her Knight, vnder who&s;e protection I cannot
<PB REF="51"> looke for ought other then good &s;ucce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dutches being as ioyfull of this his conclu&s;ion, as &s;orrowfull for his vowed determination, &s;tood &s;till a while making no aun&s;were at all. But at la&s;t being re&s;olued in her minde, that now or neuer it was time to follow her de|ui&s;ed drift: fixed her eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on him, &amp; turning her &s;p&eacute;eches to her daughter, &s;ayd. <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> I perceaue now that which I alwaies feared is come to pa&s;&s;e, concerning the loue betw&eacute;ene you and this our new Knight, which &s;ince I perceaue to be true, and that to &s;triue againe de&s;tenie is bootele&s;&s;e, I both will and commaunde you, on paine of in|curring my di&s;plea&s;ure, and by the natural loue you ought to beare me, I coniure you, not to conceale, but to make knowne vnto me, whether there be any &s;uch loue-liking be|tw&eacute;ene you, as outward &s;howes &s;&eacute;eme to make manife&s;t: which if there be, I will &s;&eacute;eke &s;ome meanes to worke both your contents, which will be a cau&s;e to drawe this Gentle|man, the &s;ooner againe vnto this our Court.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;&s;e that had already b&eacute;ene in&s;tructed in her mothers drift, and being likewi&s;e thereunto of her &s;elfe ve|ry willing, dying her ch&eacute;ekes with her maidenly blu&s;h, made her this aun&s;were. Mo&s;t gracious Prince&s;&s;e and lo|uing mother, I doe not well knowe whereunto the&s;e your &s;p&eacute;eches may intend, con&s;idering that the&s;e vaine toyes of loue, as yet I was neuer acquainted with, but yet thus much I mu&s;t n&eacute;edes confe&s;&s;e, that the liking which I haue alwaies had to this Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, proc&eacute;eded as I haue &s;till thought, from the naturall loue of a &s;i&s;ter to|wards her brother: and &s;ince the knowing of the con|trary, hath continued, or I may &s;ay, bred a greater liking then to any other what&s;oeuer: but not in &s;uch &s;ort, as by making choi&s;e of him, either to di&s;plea&s;e you or my father.</P>
<P>The Knight being as ioyfull as might be, to heare them in the&s;e tearmes: for how&s;oeuer darkly &s;he &s;pake, yet loue had &s;o &s;harpned his wits, y^t he ge&s;&s;ed very neere their mea|ning, and comming to the Prince&s;&s;e ki&s;&s;ed her hands for tho&s;e vn&s;&eacute;ene kindne&s;&s;es, de&s;iring her in all humility, to ac|cept
<PB REF="51"> him as her humble &s;eruant, and faithfull Knight: in token whereof &s;he would be&s;tow &s;ome thing on him, which in all his aduentures might put him in minde of her excel|lency, although her kind curte&s;ies were already, &s;o &s;et|led in his hart, as it was for euer impo&s;&s;ible to b&eacute;e worne out.</P>
<P>Farther would he haue proc&eacute;eded, but that the Squire earne&s;t of his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es charge, &s;ent vp to ha&s;te~ him away, which both the Dutches, and her daughter vnwilling to y&eacute;eld vnto, at la&s;t con&s;ented.</P>
<P><HI>Egi&s;ena</HI> for a fauor deliuered him a faire Diamond, which alwaies &s;he worne on her finger. Thus taking his leaue of them, beeing accompanied with the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> and di|uers other noble men, he was conuaied vnto the Sea-&s;ide, where they found his &s;hip ready prouided, &amp; hauing winde at will, were ready to &s;et &s;aile. There he tooke his leaue of the Prince, and others his friends, imbracing one ano|ther with &s;uch &s;howes of &s;orrowe, that cau&s;ed the whole company and beholders, to dew their ch&eacute;ekes with teares. The Prince <HI>Iago</HI> many times intreating to accompanie him in his voyage, regarding more his company then his fathers di&s;plea&s;ure. But hee hauing determined a longer voyage in his minde: then &s;uddenly to returne, would by no meanes con&s;ent vnto the Princes reque&s;t. Thus at length, as each thing hath his time and end, &s;&eacute;eing no in|treaty would &s;erue, hee committed him to the tuition of the almighty God, de&s;iring his pro&s;perous and &s;p&eacute;edie re|turne.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, &s;ayling towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> landed in <HI>Northwales,</HI> where he fought with a huge Mon|&s;ter, and what was the &s;ucce&s;&s;e thereof.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, beeing a|boorde, and hauing taken his leaue of the Prince, and the re&s;t of his friends, they &s;et &s;aile, hauing the wind fayre, and the Seas calme, euen as if <HI>Neptune</HI> had rou&s;ed vp him&s;elfe to welcome &s;ome d&eacute;ere friend, the Dolphins, Porpi&s;es, and other &s;trange fi&s;hes, playing a|boue the waters round about the Shippe, as b&eacute;eing &s;ent of purpo&s;e to &s;hewe plea&s;ure to the pa&s;&s;engers: whereat our new Knight tooke no &s;mall content. Thus pa&s;&s;ing away the time, &s;omewhiles in beholding the fi&s;hes, and other &s;ea &s;ights, and in plea&s;ant and merry talke with the Pilot, and Mai&s;ter of the Ship, concerning the cu&s;tomes and maners of the Seas, they &s;ayled by the &s;pace of eyght dayes, with a pro&s;perous and large wind, when towards the euening, the Mai&s;ter looking abroad, to &s;&eacute;e whether he could di&s;cerne any land, happened to &s;&eacute;e in the We&s;t north we&s;t, a &s;mall clowde, ri&s;ing in manner of a mans hand, which the more he beheld, the blacker &s;till it &s;&eacute;emed, which cau&s;ed him to doubt &s;ome in&s;uing &s;torme: therefore willing his company to take in their top &s;ayles, and al&s;o to vnlace theyr drablets and bannets, determining to try with theyr Co&s;&s;es onely. Scarce had they obeyed halfe his commaundement, when the Sky b&eacute;eing before very cl&eacute;ere, began to ouerca&s;t, and the winds to blow in &s;uch &s;ort, that in le&s;&s;e &s;pace then an houre, the Seas were growne &s;o outragious, that it &s;&eacute;emed euery billow &s;traue one with the other, which &s;hould fir&s;t boord their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed burthen: the boat-&s;waine and his fel|lowes, indeuouring with all theyr might, to take in that lit|tle &s;aile which they bare, and although it were but their co&s;|&s;es, yet could they not doe it without great danger &amp; paine.
<PB REF="52"> Others found them&s;elues bu&s;ied in pomping and ca&s;ting foorth the water, each man imploying his be&s;t help for their liues ayde. And the Prince, although vn&s;kilfull, yet labo|ring as hard as any of the re&s;t, &s;ometimes taking his turne at the pumpe, &s;ometimes to lift ouer-boord &s;uch thinges, as might any waies be a hinderance, to the more light work|ing of their &s;hippe on the Seas: &s;o that his labour was pro|fitable two waies, the one of it &s;elfe, wherein he did a&s;much good as any man, the other his example, which cau&s;ed eue|ry one to be the more willing to performe their labor. Thus continued the &s;torme for the &s;pace of two daies, to the great di&s;comfort of all the company, but e&s;pecially of the Knight, who b&eacute;eing ouertrauailed with labour, and his bodie not b&eacute;eing to-fore v&s;ed vnto the Sea, repaired into his Cabin, and ca&s;ting him&s;elfe on his bed, hoping to take &s;ome ea&s;e|ment to his re&s;tle&s;&s;e body: but &s;l&eacute;epe, the comforter of tho&s;e that are weary, y&eacute;elded him &s;mall reliefe, for no &s;ooner were his eyes clo&s;ed, but that the memory of the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;enas</HI> beauty repre&s;ented it &s;elfe vnto him: then would he con&s;ider with him&s;elfe the likelihood of his obtaining her, as the great fauor which both the Duke her father alwaies &s;hewed vnto him, and the kinde &s;p&eacute;eches at their la&s;t far|well, as al&s;o the vowed loue betwixt him&s;elfe, &amp; the Prince her Brother, which &s;&eacute;emed to promi&s;e vnto him an a&s;&s;ured obtayning. But on the contrary &s;ide, he would obiect his owne vnworthines, as b&eacute;eing but peraduenture of ba&s;e or meane Parentage, then the great &amp; mighty Princes which were de&s;irous of her loue: and la&s;t and not lea&s;t, that his ab&s;ence, (as oft times it dooth) in her likewi&s;e might breed forgetfulnes.</P>
<P>Thus reuoluing many things in his mind, hee determi|ned, if God &s;o plea&s;ed, after his enterpri&s;e again&s;t <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> ended, hee would trauell into <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hoping there to learne &s;omewhat concerning his e&s;tate, or el&s;e peraduen|ture to trauel along with the Squire &amp; <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> where he doubted not but that <HI>Adriano</HI> &s;hould re&s;olue him of that doubt. In this manner pa&s;&s;ed hee away mo&s;t part
<PB REF="53"> of the night, till towards the morning, <HI>Morpheus</HI> pittying his re&s;tle&s;&s;e e&s;tate, clo&s;ed his eyes, cau&s;ing him to inioy a &s;hort &s;lumber. But long he had not &s;lept, before y^t hee was awaked by a ioyfull cry, made by the whole company, vp|pon the &s;ight of Land: but the wind b&eacute;eing come to y^e North+ward, they were forced to put in for a harbor, called at this day <HI>Milford-hauen,</HI> where comming a&s;hore, they determi|ned to re&s;t them&s;elues, and prouide &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they wanted, again&s;t the winde &s;hould &s;erue for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which from thence was but a &s;hort cut.</P>
<P>The next day, the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t beeing (as is before-&s;aid) weary of the Sea, determined to goe recre|ate him&s;elfe a&s;hore, wherefore taking his hor&s;e and armor, accompanied onely with his Squire, he rode forth to view the Country, which he found to be indifferent fruitfull and plea&s;ant, but could &s;&eacute;e very few or no Inhabitants, which cau&s;ed him not a little to meruaile: thus rode he on y^e &s;pace of two leagues, beholding many goodly &s;treames, &amp; plea|&s;ant &s;hadowes, the delight wherof, cau&s;ed the way to &s;&eacute;eme very &s;hort. At length, comming to a &s;mall Riuers &s;ide, h&eacute;e alighted to re&s;t him&s;elfe, and deliuering his hor&s;e to his Squire, h&eacute;e layde him&s;elfe downe at the f&eacute;ete of a &s;tatelie B&eacute;ech tr&eacute;e, who&s;e thicke branches were a &s;helter vnto him from the piercing heate of <HI>Phoebus</HI> golden rayes, where he was quickly luld a&s;l&eacute;epe, with the chirping tunes of plea|&s;ant birds, and bubling noy&s;e of the &s;oft-&s;lyding &s;treame. Long had hee not re&s;ted in this plea&s;ant place, before &s;uch time as he was wakened by a pittifull out-cry, and &s;tarting vp halfe amazed, he beheld a mo&s;t huge and mighty Mon|&s;ter, in forme &s;omewhat bigger then a Cammell, his head and face not much vnlike a man, his mouth very large, as about a yard in widenes, his t&eacute;eth vpwards of a foote long, his brea&s;t and foref&eacute;ete, much like to a Lyon, his backe large and long, and for his hinder parts they were like vn|to a Beare: all his body b&eacute;eing thicke &s;et with bri&s;tles, &s;o hard as it was vnpo&s;&s;ible for any &s;word to pierce his &s;kin. Which at the fir&s;t &s;ight cau&s;ed him to &s;tand &s;ome what a|mazed,
<PB REF="53"> till perceiuing the Mon&s;ter almo&s;t to haue ouerta|ken his Squire, whom he pur&s;ued to haue deuoured, hee clapt on his Helme, and taking his Launce in his hand, he ranne to &s;uccour him, and comming n&eacute;ere vnto him, &s;mote the Mon&s;ter &s;uch a blow, as well might haue ouerthrowne a good Knight, but to him it did no harme at all, which cau|&s;ed him greatly to doubt the i&s;&s;ue of their conflict: the bea&s;t f&eacute;eling him&s;elfe &s;triken behind, left the pur&s;ute of the &s;quire, and turned about to the Knight, thinking to haue deuou|red him, and at the fir&s;t layd hold on his &s;hield with his two fore-feete, and with his mouth &s;ea&s;ed on his Helme, pre&s;|&s;ing the &s;ame with his long t&eacute;eth, to the no &s;mall doubt and a&s;toni&s;hment of the Knight, but as good hap was, he might then thank ha&s;t, for in cla&s;ping on his Helme he had forgot|ten to fa&s;ten it, which was an occa&s;ion, that at the fir&s;t pul it came from his head, which otherwi&s;e would haue pier|ced his braines. This hapned not a little to the aduantage of the Knight, who although his head were vnarmed, yet that want of Armor &s;o armed the Mon&s;ters t&eacute;eth, that for his life he could not cl&eacute;ere him&s;elfe thereof. Which gaue the Knight occa&s;ion to make a full thru&s;t at his brea&s;t, where the &s;kin b&eacute;eing not &s;o hard as in the other parts of his bo|die, gaue entrance to his tru&s;tie blade, which pierced &s;o d&eacute;epe, that it cau&s;ed great abundance of bloode to follow af|ter it: which the bea&s;t perceiuing, gaue a loude cry, and withall let goe his &s;hield, and tooke holde on his left &s;houl|der, giuing him &s;o kind a &s;alutation with his &s;harp nayles, that he brought away the armor and fle&s;h, hard to the bone, receiuing in the meane time a &s;ound blow on the deformed head, which cau&s;ed him to r&eacute;ele backwards. But his &s;kin was &s;o hard, that it pierced no more then if hee had &s;triken vppon an Anuile of &s;t&eacute;ele. Thus continued they a great while, the Mon&s;ter &s;till a&s;&s;ailing, and he auoyding, watch|ing his be&s;t aduantage to make thru&s;ts, &s;&eacute;eing blowes did nothing at all auaile. At length, beeing weary, and &s;ome|thing fainting by rea&s;on of his hurt, hee gaue backe a little to refre&s;h him&s;elfe, which the Mon&s;ter perceiuing, lay
<PB REF="54"> downe, and with his clawes &s;ought meanes to cl&eacute;ere him|&s;elfe of the Helme which hung fa&s;t in his t&eacute;eth, but before he was able to fr&eacute;e him&s;elfe thereof, the Knight who &s;lacked not to take the lea&s;t aduantage that might be, gaue him &s;o &s;ore a hurt in the belly, that it cau&s;ed both his blood &amp; guts to i&s;&s;ue out together, which the Mon&s;ter f&eacute;eling, and &s;triuing to recouer him&s;elfe on his f&eacute;ete, &s;trained &s;o much, that hee cau&s;ed his helli&s;h &s;oule to depart from his damned body.</P>
<P>The Knight &s;&eacute;eing him&s;elfe Victor, kn&eacute;eled downe im|mediatly on the ground, rendring prai&s;e and thanks to the almighty GOD, for his pro&s;perous and happy &s;ucce&s;&s;e in this his fir&s;t enterpri&s;e. Then his Squire comming vn|to him, he made ha&s;t to bind vp his wounds, and to depart towards his Ship, where hee might with more ea&s;e &amp; le&s;&s;e danger, be cured of his hurts, which grieued him not a lit|tle, e&s;pecially y^t in his left &s;houlder. But before &s;uch time as they were fully ready to depart, there came vnto them an old man, clothed like a Hermite, his head and beard be|ing as white as milke, bearing in one hand a &s;mall viole of water, and in the other a boxe of oyntment, and when hee came vnto them, he &s;aluted them very curtiou&s;ly, telling the Knight, that of long time he had expected his comming into that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed place.</P>
<P>The Knight as curteou&s;ly regr&eacute;eted him, &amp; afterwards demaunded, if he knew any place where he might be cured of &s;ome &s;mall wounds which he had receiued, &s;o which the Hermite replied, that within le&s;&s;e then halfe a league he had a &s;mall Cell, whether if it plea&s;ed him to goe, he would not doubt but within few dayes to cure him: in y^e meane time, he would a little wa&s;h and annoint the &s;ame, with &s;uch wa|ter and oyntment, as hee had for the &s;ame purpo&s;e brought with him, the Knight glad hereof, gaue him harty thanks, and hauing had his wounds dre&s;t, departed with him to|wards his Cell, where his wounds were cured, as hereaf|ter you &s;hall heare, with the occa&s;ion of the Mon&s;ters bee|ing in that place.

<P>_AFter Prince <HI>Edward</HI> had ouercome y^e Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and continued the defence of the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emelias</HI> beauty, to his great honor and renowne, hee remained a while in the <HI>French</HI> Court greatly fea&s;ted: where for a time he &s;tayed with him the two noble <HI>Danes,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> intertaining them with great fa|miliaritie and kindne&s;&s;e. But b&eacute;eing at length weary of idlene&s;&s;e, and de&s;irous to follow after their que&s;t: they de|parted towards <HI>Belgica,</HI> being earne&s;tly intreated by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince to haue accompaned him into <HI>England.</HI> Thus departed they onwards on their iourny, &s;till making diligent inquiry after their King, of whom, nor of Sir <HI>Gwaltero</HI> they could learne any certainty. In this manner rode they together, through mo&s;t part of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> leauing behind them in all places, a famous memoriall of their ver|tuous acts: which cau&s;ed their names to b&eacute;e &s;pred farre and n&eacute;ere. But at length, pa&s;&s;ing the &s;pacious Kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they arriued in the vnfortunate Dukedome of <HI>Holland:</HI> infortunate in regard of y^e many vilde cu&s;tomes erected, by the tirrany of their vngodly Duke: as is in the fir&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory declared.</P>
<P>Scarce were they entred one whole daies iourny with|in this prouince, before that Fame, the Herault of reports, had brought vnto their eares, the cu&s;tome of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> with the many famous explots there exerci&s;ed, with the innumerable number of Knights, which had there
<PB REF="55"> lo&s;t them&s;elues: among whom there was one Knight for his exc&eacute;eding vallor, farre famou&s;ed aboue the re&s;t, who by the de&s;cription of body and Armes which he bare, they pre|&s;ently imagined to be the Lord <HI>Gwaltero.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore determining either to recouer him, or loo&s;e them&s;elues, they &s;et on thetherwards, where the next mor|ning they arriued &s;o me two houres before that <HI>Phoebus</HI> vntired &s;t&eacute;edes, with their neuer re&s;ting Chariot, had at|tained the mid heauens: and comming within the view of the Ca&s;tle, the &s;trength thereof &s;trake a &s;udden amazedne&s;&s;e in them: but con&s;idering the cau&s;e of their comming, was to deliuer him whom they intirely loued, and al&s;o that to a valiant hart, nothing &s;hould &s;&eacute;eme difficult, and withal, the harder the enterpri&s;e, the more is the honor obtained by the victor: they determined rather to die, then to returne not making triall of the aduenture being &s;on&eacute;ere, which would be for euer a great di&s;honor vnto the~. The Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> de&s;iring to make the fir&s;t triall, whereunto Sir <HI>Henault</HI> willingly con&s;ented, hoping that if hee were ouercome, his honor in obtaining the victory would be the greater.</P>
<P>Thus being agr&eacute;ed, tthe Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> went pre&s;ently vnto the &s;hield, giuing it &s;uch a blow that he cleft it in two in the mid&s;t, which beeing &s;&eacute;ene by tho&s;e that garded the bridge, immediately one of them arming him&s;elfe, came foorth mounted on a mighty &s;t&eacute;ede, of a browne bay cul|lour, with a little white &s;tarre in the forehead, and one white foote: and comming with an ea&s;ie trot vnto the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> demaunded of him wherefore he &s;ought, and what was the occa&s;ion of his &s;o outragious &s;triking of the &s;hield. The Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> aun&s;wered, that his comming thether was to &s;&eacute;eke for a Knight, which bare in his &s;hield two Lions rampant &s;able, in a f&eacute;eld argent, who as he vn|der&s;tood, had b&eacute;ene by trea&s;on &s;ubdued and impri&s;oned within that Ca&s;tle, and for the &s;triking of the &s;hield, h&eacute;e li&s;ted not to giue him any other rea&s;on, then that he hoped with y^e fame Launce, to pierce both his &s;hield and his hart. The other replied, that &s;uch a Knight ind&eacute;ede was there
<PB REF="55"> impri&s;oned, who&s;e hauty hart, cau&s;ed him attempt that which he could not accompli&s;h: in pur&s;uing whereof, by force and not by trea&s;on he was vanqui&s;hed, and according to the cu&s;tome of their Ca&s;tle, made forfeiture of his life, but that for his vallor, they were contented hee &s;hould a while liue to helpe to &s;trengthen their gard, if hee could thereto be wonne. Then turning about his hor&s;e, they both prepa|red to fetch their carrere: and placing their &s;taues in their re&s;ts, they met together &s;o rudely, that the Knight of the bridge was &s;ent to mea&s;ure his length on the ground, being mortally wounded with a &s;plinter of the Launce in the vi|&s;age, the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> likewi&s;e, beeing &s;o &s;ore &s;haken with y^e incounter, as he had much to doe to k&eacute;epe his Sad|dle: then pre&s;ently came foorth other two Knights, well armed, and mounted, crying to him to prepare him&s;elfe to incounter them: which he pre&s;ently did, and m&eacute;eting toge|ther, &s;trake one of them &s;o &s;tronge a blow, that mi&s;&s;ing to|ward it with his &s;hield, his Launce pa&s;&s;ed cleane through his body: but the other Knight, breaking his Launce in the mid&s;t of his &s;hield, cau&s;ed him to tumble ouer his hor&s;e taile, but it was not long before &s;uch time as he had recoue|red his f&eacute;ete, his Squire beeing ready with the hor&s;e of the fir&s;t Knight, on which he pre&s;ently mounted, and drawing foorth his &s;word, was pre&s;ently ready to a&s;&s;ault the other, who &s;&eacute;eing him di&s;mounted, made no great ha&s;t, but with vaine glorious brauery, pa&s;&s;ed on his carrere, when tur|ning about and perceauing him to bee remounted, drew foorth his &s;word, &s;aying, Sir Knight, well may you thanke your Squire for &s;o quicke puruaying of a new hor&s;e for you, but I feare me hee &s;hall but little &s;t&eacute;ede you again&s;t the force of my arme, which hath once already &s;ent you to mea&s;ure your louti&s;h length vpon the ground.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> being madded with rage, &s;tayed not to aun&s;were him with words, but with his &s;word lent him &s;o friendly a blow, that cau&s;ed him to bend his head e|uen to his bre&s;t: but quickly recouering him&s;elfe againe, he &s;trake the other &s;uch ablow, that had hee not warded the
<PB REF="56"> &s;ame with his &s;hield, he had gone n&eacute;ere to haue cleft his head in two: thus continued they a while, &s;ometimes the one, &s;ometimes the other &s;&eacute;eming to haue the better, For|tune &s;o equally guiding the ballance, that it was hard to iudge, whether &s;ide &s;hould obtaine victory. At la&s;t, the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> imagining with him&s;elfe that to be long in con|quering, would be a cau&s;e that him&s;elfe in the end &s;hould be ouercome, determined either to obtaine a &s;p&eacute;edy conque&s;t, or a &s;p&eacute;edy death: wherefore, vniting all his forces toge|ther, and rai&s;ing him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrups, hee gaue his e|nemie &s;uch a recombendibus on the head, that the &s;t&eacute;ele be|ing of too weake a force to re&s;i&s;t y^e weight thereof, gaue fr&eacute;e pa&s;&s;age to the &s;word, which found a ready way to his braines, cau&s;ing him to fall as dead as a herring vnto the ground.</P>
<P>But before he could haue any &s;pace to re&s;t him&s;elfe, or almo&s;t to breath, came foorth other two, charging him both at once, and he as gallantly aun&s;wered their charge, recea|uing both their &s;taues vppon his &s;hield, which cau&s;ed his hor&s;e a little to &s;tagger backwards, but as they pa&s;&s;ed by, their Launces being broke~, he gaue one of them &s;o &s;ound a &s;troke on the &s;ide of the head, before h&eacute;e looked for any &s;uch matter, that he left him but halfe a face to court his Mi&s;tris withall: then prouiding to incounter the other, betwixt whom there pa&s;&s;ed a fierce and bloody conflict, but in the end the victory remained vnto the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> who al|though hee were grieuou&s;ly wounded, yet his hart being not a whit feared or any way di&s;maied, went forwards vn|to the bridge, whether Sir <HI>Henault</HI> likewi&s;e came, per&s;wa|ding him to giue ouer the enterpri&s;e to him, con&s;idering he was &s;o &s;ore hurt, but he that neuer knew what feare was, could not be &s;o lightly per&s;waded, wherefore de&s;iring Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> if he were ouercome to do his be&s;t, he made choice of &s;uch parts of armes as he wanted, and taking a &s;tronge Launce, he went forwards towards the end of the bridge, where he was incountred by two of the fiue Knights that kept the &s;ame, betwixt whom there was a long and dan|gerous
<PB REF="56"> conflict, but in the end, through faintne&s;&s;e and great lo&s;&s;e of blood, the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> &s;triking a full blow at one of them, &s;ent him&s;elfe after to the ground, his legges be|ing no longer able to &s;u&s;taine the weight of his body, y&eacute;el|ding thereby the victory to them, who were not able long to inioy the &s;ame: for the one of them euen as he fell, being in as weake e&s;tate, &s;trooke likewi&s;e at him, and mi&s;&s;ing his blow, &s;ent the whole burthen of his body to imbrace him in death, whom in life he had per&s;ued &s;o deadly. The other likewi&s;e being in little better &s;tate, &s;eeing his co~panion fall, thought to helpe him, and &s;tooping downe to lift him vp, fell him&s;elfe likewi&s;e into a traunce.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henault</HI> fearing lea&s;t his companion had b&eacute;en &s;laine, went pre&s;ently to haue taken vp his body, but was hindred by the other thr&eacute;e Knights: who all at once a&s;&s;aulted him, and being afoote in like &s;ort as he was, there beganne a bloody, though vnequall combat, each party &s;&eacute;eking to ouer|come. Thus fought they a long time, giuing and receauing many wounds: Sir <HI>Henault</HI> giuing &s;uch blowes, as well made &s;how he meant to &s;ell his liberty or life at a d&eacute;ere rate: &s;o long they fought, that at length two of them fell dead at his f&eacute;ete, the other &s;&eacute;eing his fellowes &s;laine, thought it more for his liues &s;afety to tru&s;t to his legges then his hands, &s;o that turning his backe he ranne towards the Ca|&s;tle, from whence pre&s;ently i&s;&s;ued, fiue other Knights ar|med, putting them&s;elues betw&eacute;ene Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the runne-away.</P>
<P>H&eacute;ere againe beganne a more fierce conflict then the for|mer, by rea&s;on they were fiue hardy approoued Knights, and his former battaile hauing &s;erued, but as whetting of his courage, cau&s;ed him to lay on &s;uch blowes, that in &s;hort time he had &s;ent two of their &s;oules to &s;&eacute;eke pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Cha|rons</HI> ferry: him&s;elfe and the other thr&eacute;e being greatly wea|ried, &s;toode &s;till a while to re&s;t them&s;elues: when Sir <HI>He|nault</HI> con&s;idering with him&s;elfe the cau&s;e of his fighting, as to relea&s;e his noble friend <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and al&s;o to be reuen|ged for the death of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> hee was &s;o repleat
<PB REF="57"> with ire, y^t running vpon them as a man inraged, he &s;trooke one of them &s;uch a blow, as he &s;euered his head from his &s;houlders, then laying on at the other two &s;uch mighty blowes, that hee forced them in the end to y&eacute;eld vp their &s;oules, as a &s;acrifice to his &s;word: which being ended, h&eacute;e him&s;elfe being-ouer trauelled, and hauing lo&s;t great aboun|dance of blood, &s;ate him&s;elfe downe on a &s;tone, where h&eacute;e had not long &s;itten before he fel into a&s;wound, which being &s;&eacute;ene by the Knights of the Ca&s;tle, they came foorth and tooke both him, and the body of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with the re&s;t of whom there was any hope of recouery, and car|ried them into the Ca&s;tle, where in re&s;pect of their vallor, they cau&s;ed to be carefully attended, and their wounds to be cured: per&s;wading them in the meane time to bee part|ners w^t them, in garding this their lewd cu&s;tome. Which when they beeing well, refu&s;ed, were immediatly put downe into the pri&s;on, where the King and <HI>Gwaltero</HI> re|mained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII. Howe the Hermite declared vnto the Knight, the di&s;cour&s;e of the Mon&s;ter, &amp; afterwards beeing cured of his wounds, was brought vnto an old Chappell, where hee gained an excellent Armour, beeing &s;ometimes the Armor of the famous Prince <HI>Lionell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, beeing brought by the Hermit and his Squire vnto the Hermitage, he was forthwith di&s;armed, and layd on a &s;illy coutch, on which the olde Hermit v&s;ed to lie, and b&eacute;eing carefully loo|ked vnto, and attended on by the Hermit, within 3. dayes h&eacute;e was indifferently well recouered, and &s;itting vp in his bed, he de&s;ired the old man to declare vnto him, as hee be|fore had promi&s;ed, the di&s;cour&s;e of the Mon&s;ter which hee had killed.</P>
<PB REF="57">
<P>The old man glad to &s;&eacute;e him &s;o well recouered, and al&s;o de&s;irous to plea&s;ure him in any thing he could, began thus. Mo&s;t worthy Knight, not long &s;ince there was remaining in this Country, a mo&s;t vile and wicked Gouernour, na|med <HI>Querenus,</HI> a man for the dete&s;table wickednes which he liued in, hated both of God and man, for what virgin or beautifull wife was there in this Country, which if hee li|ked, but he would force to accompli&s;h his lu&s;tfull appetite: yea to &s;uch a height of euill was he growne, that he neither feared God nor man, knowing no heauen but his worldlie plea&s;ures, nor fearing no other hell but the mi&s;ery of this life, the which hee continued to the mortall griefe of all his &s;ubiects: who in the end, b&eacute;eing wearied and ouerburthe|ned in this intollerable mi&s;erie, cho&s;e rather to end theyr liues &s;p&eacute;edily, then continually to be tormented by this blood-thir&s;tie Tyrant. Wherefore gathering them&s;elues together, they made head again&s;t the Tyrant, and after a long warre, they preuailed &s;o again&s;t him, that he was for|ced &s;ecretly to abandon his Country, and b&eacute;eing onely ac|companied with two men, taking a &s;mall boate, which h&eacute;e found ready prouided, fled away to the Sea, where hauing b&eacute;en &s;ome fixe dayes, at la&s;t was put a &s;hore in an Iland, not farre di&s;tant hence, where in times pa&s;t, the excellent and famous Magitian <HI>Bardus</HI> &s;ometimes dwelt, where be|ing landed, and calling to minde the e&s;tate which hee now was brought into, determined there to take vp his habitati|on, and to preuent both him&s;elfe and his company, from a|ny hope or de&s;ire to e&s;cape, immediatly &s;uncke the boate wherein they had e&s;caped, and afterward, b&eacute;eing diligently &s;earching in a certaine Caue, hapned to find diuers bookes of Magicke, which he tooke great delight in, minding to &s;tu|die and practi&s;e the &s;ame. And &s;o mightily profited he there|in, that in very &s;hort time he grew very expert in the &s;ame: and at length, growing old, and calling to mind his former life pa&s;t, and con&s;idering the wrong which hee thought he had &s;u&s;tained by his &s;ubiects, it cau&s;ed him to determine how to be reuenged on them, which in this &s;ort he brought
<PB REF="58"> to pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>There is in the we&s;termo&s;t parts of <HI>America,</HI> a &s;mall I|land very fruitfull, but whether by nature, or by &s;ome other accident, or determination of Fortune, onely inhabited by diuers huge and execrable Mon&s;ters, there-hence by his de|uili&s;h Art, did this vngodly <HI>Querenus</HI> cau&s;e to be brought the huge mon&s;ter, which you to your endle&s;&s;e honour haue &s;o valiantly &s;laine: and placing him h&eacute;ere, by that meanes thought fully to be reuenged, where by the &s;pace of twenty y&eacute;eres hee hath now remained, to the vtter ruine and de|&s;truction of this Country, laying it vtterly wa&s;t and de&s;o|late, hauing deuoured &s;o many Chri&s;tian bodies, that it grieues my very &s;oule to thinke of, no man before this your comming, euer daring to aduenture him&s;elfe again&s;t him, although many times there hath many great companies a&s;|&s;embled them&s;elues, to haue a&s;&s;ailed him, but comming in|to his pre&s;ence, the very &s;ight of him hath put them in &s;uch a feare, as not able to indure, they haue b&eacute;en forced to turne their backs and flie, tru&s;ting more to their h&eacute;eles then their hands, many of them b&eacute;eing not able to flie &s;o fa&s;t as theyr fellowes, where forced to &s;tay behind, &amp; remaine as foode vnto the vgly Mon&s;ter: but now (God be thanked) by your noble prowe&s;&s;e, brought vnto his end.</P>
<P>The Prince receiued no &s;mall admiration heereat, won|dering that a man &s;hould be &s;o wicked, as to reuenge his wrong by &s;o hatefull a meanes. But to bring him out of this his imaginations, the Hermit would di&s;cour&s;e with him of diuers other matters, &s;ometimes of one matter, and then of another. And now the Knight hauing remained by the &s;pace of tenne dayes in the Hermitage, he was indiffe|rent wel recouered, during which time he was many times vi&s;ited by his owne company, and al&s;o by the inhabitants of the Country, which came daily to &s;&eacute;e him. For by this time had Fame &s;o &s;pred abroade his hautie exployt, that there came many from diuers Countries adioyning, offe|ring them&s;elues, and all that they had to be at his di&s;po&s;iti|on: but he b&eacute;eing not minded to &s;tay there longer then that
<PB REF="58"> his wounds were throughly whole, gaue them thankes for their kind proffer, telling them y^t hee could not accept of the the &s;ame, by rea&s;on he was to follow a certaine earne&s;t ad|uenture which he was in que&s;t of. Thus pa&s;&s;ing away the time vntill he was fully whole, the day before he meant to depart towards his &s;hip, the old Hermit being in talk with him, told him of a certaine aduenture not farre of, which in his younger y&eacute;eres, he did remember to haue &s;&eacute;ene many to make tryall thereof, but neuer heard of any to haue attai|ned the accompli&s;hment of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Knight b&eacute;eing de&s;irous to know the &s;ame, de&s;ired the Hermit to declare it vnto him, which he did in this ma|ner. Not far hence (quoth he) there &s;tandeth a &s;mall Chap|pell, &s;ituate at the foote of an hill, nowe altogether ouer|growne with bryers and bu&s;hes, by rea&s;on of the Mon&s;ters crueltie, which lately to your eternall renowne, you &s;o fa|mou&s;ly haue vanqui&s;hed and &s;laine: in former time this Chappell was dedicated to the diuine &s;eruice of GOD, by the renowned King <HI>Flintus,</HI> Prince of the Brittons, in the time that the Romans ruled h&eacute;ere with their mighty Legi|ons, and afterwards beautified and adorned by y^e famous Prince <HI>Lionell</HI> his &s;onne, with many &s;umptious and co&s;tlie ornaments. In the mid&s;t of which a little before his death, he cau&s;ed his owne Armor, being one of the be&s;t in y^e world, and with which hee had accompli&s;hed many excellent at|chieuements, to be hanged vp there, to be kept for his eter|nall memory. Where it remained a great while vntouched of any, onely through the priuiledge of the place, vntill the time of the famous <HI>Arthur,</HI> at which time y^e excellent Magi|tian <HI>Merlin</HI> knowing that there would be many, which not re&s;pecting the &s;inne of &s;acriledge, would not &s;tick to take a|way &s;o precious a Iewell as was the &s;ame, ca&s;t foorthwith &s;o mighty an inchauntment on the Armor, that none but &s;uch a one, who in his time &s;hould excell all others, both in valour, curte&s;ie and loyaltie, &s;hould be able to take downe the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now not long after, according to his imagination it fell
<PB REF="59"> out, for many b&eacute;eing de&s;irous to obtaine &s;o good an Armor, made tryall to take the &s;ame away, but hetherunto there was no man &s;o hardy, as once to moue it. Wherfore I am fully per&s;waded, that it was ordained onely for you, in whom I may boldly &s;ay, remaines the greate&s;t vallor and magnanimitie, that may be po&s;&s;ible in any Knight now li|uing, as already your d&eacute;edes haue manife&s;ted. The prince thanking him for his vnde&s;erued pray&s;es, attributing them rather to his loue and affection towards him, then for any merrite he knew in him&s;elfe worthy the lea&s;t of them: with|all de&s;iring the good olde man, to accompany him thether, where he would likewi&s;e make triall of his fortune, as ma|ny others had doone before him, albeit he had no hope to at|taine that, which &s;o many good Knights had failed of.</P>
<P>Thus departing from the Hermitage, they went the next way towards the Chappell, where they arriued about the time they were wont to &s;ing their euening Ma&s;&s;e there, at their comming they found it de&s;olate, the doores &amp; win|dowes ouer-growne with bryers and nettles, the walls ruinous, and all things el&s;e growne into decay, which cau|&s;ed not onely the auncient Hermit, but al&s;o the whole com|pany to &s;hed teares from theyr eyes. Then at the reque&s;t of the Prince, the Hermit &s;ang Euen &s;ong vnto them, which had not b&eacute;en heard there in twenty y&eacute;eres before.</P>
<P>Theyr prayers b&eacute;eing ended, they went vp in a &s;mall Ile of the Chappell, where hung the fore&s;aid Armor, with diuers other Reliques, which hee beheld, with a great de|&s;ire to inioy the &s;ame: then lifting vp his eyes to heauen, imploring God to be his ayde, he &s;tretched foorth his hand to take them downe from their place; which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> without any paine at all, to the no &s;mall admiration of the behol|ders. Then pulling of his owne Armor, he armed him&s;elfe with this which he had gotten, which fitted him &s;o well, as if it purpo&s;ely had b&eacute;ene made for him. The Armor was of a greene cullour, repre&s;enting a fielde full of Orenge trees bearing fruite, &s;ome fallen, &s;ome ripe as ready to fall, and &s;ome againe gr&eacute;ene, as but now budding, which wrought
<PB REF="59"> &s;uch a content vnto the Princes minde, as not any thing might be greater. The &s;hield al&s;o he tooke on his arme, and although it was imper&s;able, yet was it framed of &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tance, that it was as light as any ordinary &s;hield, the deuice b&eacute;eing in a fielde <HI>Verte,</HI> thr&eacute;e Lyons rampant, or &s;ignifying ind&eacute;ede, thr&eacute;e Lyons which the famous <HI>Lyonell</HI> &s;lew in the Kingdome of <HI>Spayne,</HI> as you may reade in that Hi&s;tory, and from which likewi&s;e hee was called <HI>Lyon|queller.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How the Prince <HI>Euordanus</HI> departing out of <HI>Walles,</HI> arriued in <HI>Ireland,</HI> naming him&s;elfe <HI>the Knight of the Lyons,</HI> and what hapned vnto him on his way towards <HI>Dublin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe Prince hauing throughly recouered him &s;elfe of his wounds which he receiued of the Mon&s;ter, and hauing gained the Armor and &s;hielde of the famous <HI>Lionell,</HI> departed to|wards y^e harbor of <HI>Milford,</HI> taking his leaue of the courtious Hermi&s;e, and the re&s;t of the inhabitants of the Country: many of whome were de&s;irous to haue kept him company, but he would not in any wi&s;e accept thereof. And now being come vnto the harbor, he found his &s;hippe in a readine&s;&s;e, and hauing the wind indifferent faire, they &s;et &s;aile towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the next day they arriued in the famous Riuer of <HI>Waterford:</HI> where beeing come to an ancor, they went on &s;hore to view the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the Country.</P>
<P>Which at that time was indifferent delightfull, by rea|&s;on of the many plea&s;ant &s;prings, which de&s;cended from the Mountaines, cau&s;ing with their rumbling noi&s;e a mo&s;t de|lightfull harmony. The next day the Prince accompanied only with his owne Squire, and the Squire of <HI>Lenarda,</HI> whom hee willed in any wi&s;e not to make him knowne, otherwi&s;e thenby the name of the Knight of the Lions. De|parted towards the Citty of <HI>Dublin,</HI> whereas <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> re|mained,
<PB REF="60"> in the delightfull companie of <HI>Valeria,</HI> for &s;o was the Merchants daughter named, of whom he was &s;o great|ly enamored, and for who&s;e &s;ake he accompli&s;hed diuers and &s;undry combats, defending her beauty again&s;t al com|mers, to his no &s;mall fame and renowne: for that within the &s;pace of two yeares he had ouer-come and &s;ubdued, a|boue a thou&s;and Knights, not at any time him&s;elfe hauing receaued the foyle.</P>
<P>Thetherwards rode the Knight of the Lyons, coa&s;ting ouer Mountaines and Vallies: the fir&s;t day not hapning on any aduenture worth the recitall. The next day in the morning, a little after hee was departed from the place whereas they had line that night, there met him a Dam&s;ell, mounted on a &s;mall hackny, making meruailous ha&s;t, and comming vnto him, ca&s;ting her &s;elfe from her hor&s;e to the ground, &s;pake in this manner. Mo&s;t courtious and valiant Knight, for &s;o much my minde a&s;&s;ureth you to bee: let the humble petition of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Dam&s;ell in the world, mooue your nohle hart to pittie and relieue this my cruell di&s;a&s;ter, which without the ayde of you or &s;ome other valiant Knight is now vncurable, wherefore by your &s;o|lemne oath of Knight-hood, by which you are bound to de|fend all di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, e&s;pecially Ladies and Dam|&s;els, and al&s;o by her whom you loue mo&s;t, I coniure you, to ayde and defend me in a mo&s;t right and iu&s;t quarrell.</P>
<P>The Knight beholding her wofull ie&s;ture, with her &s;o|lemne coniurations, which &s;he vttered with &s;uch aboun|dance of &s;ighes, and teares flowing downe from the foun|taines of her eyes, as might haue mooued the harde&s;t hart to relent, cau&s;ed her to &s;tand vp, and willed her to declare the effect and cau&s;e of this her complaint, a&s;&s;uring her, that if her cau&s;e were core&s;pondent to her &s;orrowes, &s;he had met with one who would either loo&s;e his life, or worke her con|tent. The Dam&s;ell b&eacute;eing comforted with this his pro|mi&s;e, ro&s;e vp from the ground, and wiping the teares from her eyes, began thus. Mo&s;t woorthy Knight, know that not pa&s;&s;ing fiue leagues hence, there dwelt &s;ometimes a fa|mous
<PB REF="60"> &amp; valiant Knight, who in the flowre of his age proo|ued &s;till fortunate in all his enterpri&s;es, e&s;pecially in his loue towards a noble Dame of this Country, named <HI>Mo|lenda,</HI> whom at length by the con&s;ent of theyr friends hee inioyed in lawfull marriage, and liued together a long time in great ioy and content: and in their latter y&eacute;eres GOD ble&s;&s;ed them with a faire daughter, whom they named <HI>Mo|de&s;ta,</HI> happy in that &s;hee was di&s;cended from &s;o vertuous Parents, but afterward mo&s;t infortunate, as by the pro|ce&s;&s;e of my &s;p&eacute;eches you &s;hall vnder&s;tand. For <HI>Eugenius,</HI> (for &s;o was the auncient Knight my father called) b&eacute;eing &s;triken in y&eacute;eres, &amp; hauing no more children but my &s;elfe, who then had attained vnto the age of twelue y&eacute;eres, my Father (as I haue before &s;ayd) b&eacute;eing &s;triken in age, and al&s;o grieuou&s;ly vexed with an extreame malady, called vn|to him my mother and my &s;elfe, and after &s;ome fatherly ex|hortations to me giuen, he turned vnto my mother &amp; &s;ayd.</P>
<P>My d&eacute;ere and mo&s;t beloued <HI>Molenda,</HI> knowing that my fatall time is at hand, and that death, who &s;pareth no man, hath already &s;ea&s;ed on my body, I haue thought good be|fore my death, to recommend this our daughter vnto your mo&s;t louing and motherly care, de&s;iring you in any ca&s;e, not to permit or &s;uffer her, b&eacute;eing come vnto ripene&s;&s;e of y&eacute;eres, to match with any of this Prouince, which vnto my &s;oule would be mo&s;t grieuous: and y^t during her nonage, you would &s;&eacute;e her mo&s;t carefully in&s;tructed in vertue, wher|by &s;he may be worthy of this patrimony whereunto &s;hee is borne. My father hauing vttered the&s;e or &s;uch like &s;p&eacute;eches, and finding him&s;elfe to draw towards his end, imbraced vs both in his armes, and turning about his face, immedi|atly departed out of this wretched world, leauing vs to be|waile this our cro&s;&s;e fortunes. Now after wee had &s;olem|ni&s;ed his funeralls, and had according to the v&s;e of thys Country, by the &s;pace of one whole y&eacute;ere, in mournfull at|tire bewailed his death: it hapned on a time, that my mo|ther b&eacute;eing de&s;irous to recreate her ouer-troubled minde, with &s;ome delightfull plea&s;ures, de&s;ired a great number of
<PB REF="61"> her neighbours, as well Knights, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Dam&s;els, as al&s;o others of meaner &s;ort, to come vnto her Ca&s;tle, where they were all hartily welcome, and worthily fea&s;ted by the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e dayes, during which &s;pace, they pa&s;t away the time with many &s;undry di&s;ports, to the con|tent of vs all.</P>
<P>But alas h&eacute;ere began the head or &s;pring of all my griefe, as by the &s;equell of my &s;p&eacute;eches you &s;hall perceiue, for a|mong&s;t this company, there was a Knight who&s;e liueli|hood ioyned with ours, a man indued with rites &s;ufficient, had the Gods graced him &s;o well with vertue and good con|ditions. This Knight, I &s;ay, fayning him&s;elfe to be atta|ched with my beauty, de&s;ired mee of my mother in marri|age. But &s;he re&s;pecting more the riches of the mind, then the worldly wealth of the man, gaue him a flat deniall, al|leaging my youth to be &s;uch, as was very vnfit for a hu&s;|band: and that to match a young gerle without a &s;etled affection, was the next way to leade her into a life farre wor&s;e then death: for then to be matched where one cannot loue, there is on earth no greater torment.</P>
<P>H&eacute;e taking this deniall in very ill part, departed vnto his owne Ca&s;tle, b&eacute;eing not pa&s;&s;ing thr&eacute;e leagues of, where h&eacute;e remained awhile, contemplating reuenge in his hart, and deui&s;ing by what meanes he might accompli&s;h the &s;ame, at la&s;t determined to winne y^t by force, which by fayre means he could not hope to attaine. And b&eacute;eing &s;etled in this re&s;o|lution, he gathered together the greate&s;t forces y^t hee could: and within a month after, no one &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch villanie, in the night time mo&s;t trayterou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted our Ca&s;tle, where hauing gotten the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, &s;lew all tho&s;e who made any re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t him. And taking my mo|ther in her Chamber, threatned her with &s;he like crueltie as hee had &s;hewed vnto the re&s;t, if foorthwith &s;h&eacute;e did not giue me her wofull daughter, to be his Concubine: for now hauing gotten our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by force, he di&s;dained to haue me to his wife, which I b&eacute;eing in the next r&eacute;eme and hea|ring, immediatly threw my &s;elfe out at a window, where
<PB REF="61"> by chance faling to the ground without any great hurt, I found his Palfry ready tide, on which foorthwith I moun|ted, flying away as fa&s;t as I could, neuer &s;taying in any place, vntill now m&eacute;eting with you, of whom I hope to re|ceiue helpe and comfort.</P>
<P>Hare &s;he &s;tayed her &s;p&eacute;eches, pouring foorth abundance of teares, which cau&s;ed the young Knight greatly to pittie her: vowing vnto her, if that they remained his comming, he would &s;o puni&s;h theyr dete&s;table trea&s;ons, as &s;hould be both to her content, and al&s;o an example to all tho&s;e, who &s;hould afterward attempt the like. And willing her to leade on the way, they rode onwards mo&s;t part of the day, not m&eacute;eting with any one till euening, about the time that <HI>Ve|&s;perus</HI> appearing in the We&s;t, gaue them warning to take vp theyr lodging, which forthwith they did: for comming into a little thicke wood, and the Sky waxing dark, where|by they feared to mi&s;&s;e theyr way, they layde them&s;elues downe vnder a thicke tuffe of tr&eacute;es, where after they had refre&s;hed them&s;elues, with &s;uch viands as his Squire had brought with him, they betooke them&s;elues to &s;l&eacute;epe, the Prince not &s;o much as putting off his Helme, for feare lea&s;t they might be &s;et on in their &s;l&eacute;epe: and hee al&s;o appointed the two Squires to watch by turne, &s;o much did his mind mi&s;doubt the wickednes of tho&s;e people, who inhabited thereabouts, giuen onely to rapine and theft.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Howe the Knight of the Lyons &s;leeping in a wood, was &s;et on by a company of thieues: and after, how hee came to the Ca&s;tle of the wofull Lady <HI>Molenda,</HI> where hee &s;lewe the traytor <HI>Calepin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Knight b&eacute;eing accompanied with his two Squires, and the Dam&s;ell, had &s;carcely &s;lept vntill midnight, when his Squire, who&s;e turne was to watch, gaue him notice that hee did heare a noy&s;e not farre off, which hee did
<PB REF="62"> iudge to be of &s;ome company comming towards them. The Prince, immediatly taking his &s;hielde on his arme, &amp; put|ting him&s;elfe in a readines, commaunded them to lie &s;till, fayning them&s;elues to &s;l&eacute;epe, which they did, when pre&s;ent|ly they beheld tenne thieues armed with &s;words and other weapons, who comming n&eacute;ere them, conferred among&s;t them&s;elues, whether it were be&s;t to kill them as they &s;lept, or el&s;e to &s;et vpon them, and hauing bound them, to robbe the~ of that they had: which when the Knight heard he im|mediatly &s;tart vp, and taking his &s;word in his hand, ranne vpon them, where the fir&s;t he met with he &s;ent to <HI>Pluto</HI> his kingdome, to giue an account of his wicked life: his fel|lowes beholding his mi&s;hap, layde on with all theyr forces, vowing to be reuenged for his death, whom &s;oone after they did accompanie: for the Knight b&eacute;eing both &s;trong, and al|&s;o well armed with the Armor of Sir <HI>Lionell,</HI> made no ac|count of theyr blowes, which to him did no more hurt then if they had layd on theyr blowes vppon &s;ome flintie Rocke. Thus continued the fight by the &s;pace of an houre, in which time he had di&s;patched &s;ixe of them: the others thinking to &s;aue them&s;elues by flight, were &s;tayed by the two Squires, who &s;lew one of them out-right, the others falling on theyr knees de&s;ired pardon, which the Knight forthwith granted them, cau&s;ing the~ to &s;weare to giue ouer that kinde of life, which they did: the one of them being &s;omething &s;triken in y&eacute;eres, betooke him&s;elfe afterwards to a Hermitage, where hee &s;pent the re&s;t of his life in prayer, and bewailing of his &s;innes, an other intreated him to accept of him as his &s;laue, which the Prince was the more willing to doe, in regard that hee &s;hould &s;erue him as a guide, during his trauell in that Country, which vnto a &s;tranger is very perrilous.</P>
<P>And truly afterwards he did not repent the &s;auing of his life, for that he did him good &s;eruice, as you &s;hall reade in the &s;equell of the Hi&s;tory. After this conflict, the Knight and his company remained all the remnant of the night di&s;cour|&s;ing of many matters, in which the th&eacute;efe declared vnto him the fa&s;hion of the Country, which vnto the Knight &s;&eacute;e|med
<PB REF="62"> very &s;trange. Now beautifull <HI>Aurora</HI> hauing chan|ged her mourning w&eacute;ede, and cladde her&s;elf in her riche&s;t robes, to welcom her d&eacute;ere beloued bridegroome the &s;unne, the Knight of the Lyons with his company mounted on hor&s;ebacke, all &s;auing his newe entertained &s;eruaunt <HI>Gil|limo,</HI> for &s;o was the th&eacute;efe called whom he had receiued into his &s;eruice: and taking his n&eacute;ere&s;t way to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Mo|lenda,</HI> they trauelled on vntill it was about nine of y^e clock, at what time they arriued there, (euen as <HI>Callapin</HI> hauing rifled the &s;ame, was ready to depart, cau&s;ing two of his companions to dreg the good old Lady by the hayre, mind|ing to carry her vnto a Ca&s;tle of his, where &s;hee &s;hould re|maine pri&s;oner, vntill &s;uch time as &s;hee &s;hould deliuer her daughter, with the whole inhearitance into his cu&s;todie,) which when the Knight of the Lyons beheld, he &s;et &s;purres vnto his hor&s;e, and hauing almo&s;t ouertaken them, &s;aid, Stay villaines, and declare wherefore you v&s;e that Ladie in &s;uch vile &s;ort, or el&s;e you &s;hall d&eacute;erely abide it. <HI>Callapin</HI> turning about, and &s;&eacute;eing but one Knight pur&s;uing them, &s;ayd, I li&s;t not to declare the cau&s;e vnto th&eacute;e, but if thou get th&eacute;e not packing, my Launce &s;hall teach th&eacute;e the guerdon due for thy too much ouer boldnes. Then placing theyr &s;taues in theyr re&s;ts, they ranne one again&s;t the other with all their forces, and m&eacute;eting together, theyr incounter was &s;o furious, that <HI>Callapin</HI> was throwne to the ground being verie &s;ore bru&s;ed with the fall. The other pa&s;&s;ed on halfe a&s;toni&s;hed, as neuer hauing receiued the like buffet. Then turning about his hor&s;e with his &s;word drawne, he rode to|wards <HI>Callapin,</HI> who by this time had recouered his f&eacute;ete, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, di&s;mounted him&s;elfe, deliuering his hor&s;e vnto <HI>Gillimo,</HI> who by this time was come vnto them: h&eacute;ere began a mo&s;t dangerous and fierce foote combat, for <HI>Callapin</HI> was one of the be&s;t Knights in all <HI>Ireland,</HI> and knew well how to defend him|&s;elfe, but yet farre vnequall to the other: who pur&s;ued him with &s;o many huge &amp; weighty blowes, breaking his &s;hield and Armor in p&eacute;eces, that he cau&s;ed the blood to i&s;&s;ue foorth
<PB REF="63"> abundantly: him&s;elfe through the goodnes of his Armour not hauing receiued any wound, &s;o that it manife&s;tly ap|peared, which way the victory would bend it &s;elfe: had it not b&eacute;ene that the re&s;t of <HI>Callapins</HI> company, (who percei|ued him almo&s;t ouercome) put them&s;elues in his defence: H&eacute;ere againe the battell began to grow doubtfull, they b&eacute;e|ing eyght, and all on hor&s;ebacke, whereby they had the far greater aduantage: which the good Knight perceiuing, and &s;&eacute;eing there was no way to auoyde this danger but by his owne prowe&s;&s;e, gaue <HI>Callapin</HI> &s;o &s;ound a blow on the head, that cleauing both Helme and head to the t&eacute;eth, cau&s;ed him to fall dead to the ground: and making as if he would haue fled, hee came to <HI>Gillimo,</HI> and mounting him&s;elfe on hor&s;e|back, he incountred one of them, who breaking his &s;taffe on his good &s;hield, was &s;ent be&s;ides his &s;addle to mea&s;ure his length on the ground, where to make him &s;ure for dooing a|ny further harme, <HI>Gillimo</HI> tooke paynes to cut off his head. But now was the other &s;eauen come vnto him, who all at once charged him with their Launces, in &s;uch &s;ort, that his hor&s;e not b&eacute;eing able to indure the incounter, fel vnder him, but &s;oone was h&eacute;e againe remounted by his Squire, who brought him <HI>Callapins</HI> hor&s;e, then began hee to lay on &s;uch blowes, as well he gaue them to vnder&s;tand, y^t they could not long indure again&s;t him, fro~ &s;ome cutting their armes from their bodies, ouerthrowing others to the ground, who neuer could ri&s;e againe, for that the two Squires and <HI>Gil|limo</HI> made them &s;afe, by cutting their throats: thus conti|nued the battell two long howres, the Knight of the Lyons neuer hauing lei&s;ure to breathe him&s;elfe, &s;o ob&s;tinate were they in the &s;&eacute;eking of theyr owne deaths: which by thys time &s;ixe of them had gained: the other two, &s;&eacute;eing theyr fellowes all &s;laine, betooke the~&s;elues to flight, hoping there|by to &s;aue theyr liues, but b&eacute;eing pur&s;ued by the Knight, they were &s;oone ouertaken, leauing theyr liues for a &s;ati&s;|faction of theyr former offences. Which when <HI>Molenda</HI> perceiued, with her Daughter, who by this time was come vnto her, ca&s;t them&s;elues at his f&eacute;ete, and gaue him
<PB REF="63"> mo&s;t hartie thankes for theyr deliuery, proffering him all that they had, if h&eacute;e would accept thereof. But hee ray&s;ing them from the ground, willed them to render thankes to GOD, who had &s;ent him as a &s;courge to puni&s;h &s;uch wicked offenders, as were tho&s;e whom hee had vanqui|&s;hed.</P>
<P>Then taking theyr way into the Ca&s;tle, they remained there all that night, where they were fea&s;ted by the Mo|ther and the Daughter, who &s;&eacute;eing him &s;o young and beau|tifull, admired how he could be of &s;uch force, to effect &s;uch d&eacute;edes as hee had brought to pa&s;&s;e: therefore de&s;iring to know what hee was, <HI>Molenda</HI> beganne in this &s;ort: Mo&s;t valiant Knight, &s;&eacute;eing you will not receiue any thing of vs, whereby we might manife&s;t vnto you the thankfulnes of our mindes, yet I be&s;&eacute;ech you let vs know vnto whom we are &s;o much bounden, whereby in our prayers we may record this your memorable action.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. How the Prince of <HI>England</HI> demaunded <HI>Emilia</HI> of her father in marriage, and of the &s;trange aduenture that hapned in the <HI>French</HI> Court, whereby all the chiefe Knights were forced to for&s;ake the Court.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is declared in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, how that Prince <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being in the <HI>French</HI> Court, where he ouercame the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and after maintai|ned the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> to be the beauti|fulle&s;t Lady in the world, of whom hee grew &s;o farre in|amoured, that hee determined to demaunde her of the King her father. Wherefore one day being in a melan|cholly humor, walking in a delightfull garden, ioyning to the Pallace to recreate him&s;elfe, the King likewi&s;e came thether, being accompanied with one page only, and fin|ding the Prince &s;omewhat pen&s;iue, demaunded the cau&s;e thereof: to which he replied. The cau&s;e of this my dumpes, in which you &s;ay I now am in, proc&eacute;edes partly from your &s;elfe, in regard I feare your deniall in a matter, for which I minde to be a &s;uter vnto you: which feare driues me in|to a doubt, whether I were be&s;t to &s;peake in the &s;ame, fea|ring to bee denayd, or el&s;e conceals the &s;ame to my &s;elfe, which likewi&s;e may br&eacute;ede a farther danger.</P>
<P>The King a while &s;tudying with him&s;elfe, what the matter might be, at length gaue him this aun&s;were. Mo&s;t noble Prince, the loue which I bare vnto you is &s;uch, that it cau&s;eth me not to di&s;&s;emble with you, wherefore knowe that I cannot chu&s;e but take the&s;e your &s;p&eacute;eches, in very vnkind part, how&s;oeuer by you &s;poken: for if the matter be rea&s;onable which you would reque&s;t, then how farre you wrong mee in doubting my con&s;ent therein, I referre to God only, who knowes the thoughts of my hart. If vnrea|&s;onable, to your &s;elfe, who knowes what it is from ones friend to expect tho&s;e things, which hee cannot well with|out
<PB REF="64"> his great preiudice graunt: wherefore declare boldly what it is that troubles your minde, and a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe, you &s;hall finde me willing to &s;ati&s;fie you therein, if it b&eacute;e not greatly to the preiudice of my honor, and &s;tate of this my Kingdome. The Prince hearing this friendly, and to him ioyfull conclu&s;ion: replied, that he did greatly thanke his Maie&s;tie, for that great loue which hee did a&s;&s;ure him of: wherefore now putting all feare and doubte a&s;ide, h&eacute;e would declare the &s;ame vnto him, which was this: that be|ing greatly wounded with the vertues, and beauty of the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia</HI> his daughter, whom in hart he had vow|ed to loue, and fearing lea&s;t he had otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of her, ind&eacute;ede was the cau&s;e of his pen&s;iuene&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Which when the King heard, with a &s;miling counten|ance made him this aun&s;were: and is it po&s;&s;ible, that beau|tie can cau&s;e &s;uch alteration in you, or el&s;e that loue can &s;o &s;oone take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your hart, as comming fr&eacute;e to this my Court, where you haue &s;carcely remained one month: but ind&eacute;ede your combat with the Duke our Co&s;in, and af|ter hazarding your &s;elfe in the &s;ame Challenge, did cau&s;e me, in &s;ort to imagine, that you were &s;omewhat intangled in tho&s;e nets.</P>
<P>But now to the purpo&s;e, as &s;he is my daughter, &s;o doe I thinke &s;hee will not make her choi&s;e without my con&s;ent, neither I being her father, will force her con&s;ent where &s;he doth not loue, but if by faire meanes &s;hee may be wonne h&eacute;ereunto, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe, that the hou&s;e of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> is mo&s;t willing to linke it &s;elfe in loue and amitie with the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e noble vallour, de&s;erues to b&eacute;e highly had in e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The Prince for this his kinde graunt, would n&eacute;edes haue ki&s;t his royall hands, which the King would not &s;uf|fer him to doe, but imbracing him in his armes, departed immediately into the Pallace, and com|ming into the Queenes chamber of pre&s;ence, called for the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> and willing all &s;aue the Qu&eacute;ene, and her to a voyd the pre&s;ence, hee demaunded of her, whether
<PB REF="65"> there were any loue betw&eacute;ene her and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince: at which demaunde, &s;he dying her Princely ch&eacute;ekes with a maidenly blu&s;h, and falling on her kn&eacute;es, aun&s;wered. Mo&s;t gracious father, con&s;idering that in concealing the truth from you, being therof demaunded, I &s;hall not only breake the bounds of duty by being di&s;obedient, but al&s;o offende God in making of a lie: know therefore, that &s;ince the day wherein he ouercame the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> I haue &s;o in|tangled my &s;elfe in his loue, which before being by him &s;ued vnto I made &s;corne of, that I can finde no way to alter the &s;ame, but by death only, which rather then it &s;hould be to your di&s;like, I would willingly indure were it neuere &s;o cruell.</P>
<P>The King beeing ioyfull h&eacute;ereat, yet &s;&eacute;eming to be di&s;|contented, &s;aid: In faith and is it po&s;&s;ible, that thou mo&s;t fond and fooli&s;h gearle, &s;houlde&s;t &s;o much forget the bounds of dutie and vertue, as without my con&s;ent, &s;o to &s;ettle thy fancie on a &s;tranger: but I doubt not but thou wilt as &s;oone repent thy choi&s;e, as thou ha&s;t forgotten thy duty in choo&s;ing, for who knowes whether he being a young amo|rous Prince, hath not made &s;ome other choi&s;e already, where then are thy hopes, or what will become of thy loue. The Prince&s;&s;e hearing her father in the&s;e tearmes, knewe not well what aun&s;were to make, but at length with teares in her eies, and fetching a d&eacute;epe &s;igh from her hart, &s;h&eacute;e be|&s;ought him to con&s;ider &s;he force and power of loue, which was of &s;uch might, that who mo&s;t &s;ought to &s;triue again&s;t it, was the more cruelly therewith in the end wounded: and that as yet her loue being knowne to none, &s;&eacute;eing it &s;o greatly di&s;liked his Maie&s;tie, &s;he would for euer k&eacute;epe clo&s;e, although it did co&s;t her, her life: which &s;h&eacute;e was &s;ure it would doe, &s;&eacute;eing it had taken already &s;uch d&eacute;epe rooting in her hart. The King &s;&eacute;eing her con&s;tancie, &amp; loth to grieue her any farther, tooke her by the arme, &amp; rai&s;ing her from the ground, bid her to be of good comfort, for &s;&eacute;eing that her affection proc&eacute;eded from vertue, and not of any wanton or lu&s;tfull appetite, hee did both alowe of it, and y&eacute;eld con&s;ent
<PB REF="65"> vnto the choi&s;e which &s;he had made, willing her farther, to e&s;t&eacute;eme of the Prince, as one who not only d&eacute;erely loued her, but al&s;o was worthy to be beloued, both for his vallor &amp; magnanimitie of mind, of the greate&s;t Lady in Chri&s;ten|dome.</P>
<P>Thus leauing her not a little comforted, he went to im|part the &s;ame to the Prince, vnto whom this newes was more welcome, then to haue b&eacute;ene made Lord of the grea|ted Kingdome of the world. And taking order with y^e King for the day of their marriage, again&s;t which time there &s;hould be prepared a great Turny, hee al&s;o &s;ent ouer into <HI>England</HI> the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> to certifie the King his fa|ther h&eacute;ereof, which was to him mo&s;t welcome newes, b&eacute;e|ing now greatly &s;triken in yeares. Al&s;o there were many Heraults &s;ent foorth to proclaime this great Turny, which &s;hould beheld in the Citty of <HI>Parris,</HI> at the nuptials of the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> and the beautifull <HI>Emelia:</HI> again&s;t which time there came daily, many braue and gallant Knights, from diuers Kingdomes, as well Chri&s;tians as Sara&s;ines: for that the King had graunted by his procla|mations, a &s;afe conduct for all commers.</P>
<P>Now in this meane time, the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> being throughly recouered of his wounds, which he had receaued again&s;t <HI>Don Edward,</HI> and finding that with the lo&s;&s;e of his honor, he had likewi&s;e lo&s;t his loue, grew therewith into &s;o great rage, that he would haue &s;laine him&s;elfe, had it not b&eacute;ene for &s;ome of his &s;eruants, who alwaies gaue dilligent attendance vnto him: and deui&s;ing with him&s;elfe on re|uenge, at la&s;t re&s;olued by vnknowne trechery, to bring it thus to pa&s;&s;e. There was in this his Dukedome a great Inchaunter, who with his accur&s;ed &s;pells, was able in a manner to pull the &s;tarres out of their places: to this man the Duke re&s;orted, and making him priuie to his intent, de&s;ired him to deui&s;e &s;ome meanes how vnknowne h&eacute;e might be reuenged on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince. The Inchaun|ter willing to &s;howe his loue vnto the Duke, immediately deui&s;ed a meane, how not only to be reuenged on y^e prince,
<PB REF="66"> but al&s;o on as many as were welwillers vnto him: which he did bring to pa&s;&s;e in this &s;ort. There was in y^e Kingdom of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> &s;ome tenne leagues from <HI>Parris</HI> a great For|re&s;t, in which this Inchaunter by his deuili&s;h art, erected a &s;tately Ca&s;tle inuironed about with high walls, &amp; d&eacute;epe ditches, &s;o as it &s;&eacute;emed one of the &s;tronge&s;t, and faire&s;t Ca&s;tles of the Kingdome: likewi&s;e he inchaunted it in &s;uch &s;ort, that though a thou&s;and Knights had &s;ought for it, yet notwith&s;tanding there &s;hould none haue found the &s;ame, but &s;uch as they thought &s;hould not be of &s;uch force, as to conquer the gardants, who were two fierce &amp; mighty Gy|ants, farre exc&eacute;eding the common &s;tature of others of that kind. Al&s;o there was a Knight a kin&s;man of the Dukes, who being acco~panied with 20 or 30 attendants, alwaies remained h&eacute;erein: the Giants who kept the gard, the one of them was called <HI>Brandofell,</HI> with him fir&s;t mu&s;t tho&s;e Knights haue to doe, that came to make triall of this ad|uenture, the other was named <HI>Furioll,</HI> excelling in &s;trength all the Giants of his time, to him belonged the combat with tho&s;e Kinghts, to whom fortune was &s;o fauorable, as to ouercome <HI>Brandofell.</HI> In this manner hauing prouided for the garde of this inchaunted Ca&s;tle, they deui&s;ed a meane by which to bring the Prince vnto the &s;ame, which was in this manner. The Inchaunter <HI>Ligu&s;targo,</HI> for &s;o was he called, had a daughter indifferent faire, who in di&s;&s;imulation was as &s;kilfull, as her father in the art of Ma|gicke, for &s;he had her teares at commaund, and could &s;o well frame her countenance to &s;orrowe, that there was none but would haue taken her to be very &s;orrowe it &s;elfe: to her was referred the meanes to &s;educe the Prince, who comming vnto the Court, with her haire di&s;per&s;&s;ed about her &s;houlders, her garments rent and torne, and beeing conducted into the great Hall, &s;he was admired at of eue|ry one, and greatly pittied, for the outward &s;howe of &s;or|rowe, which did &s;&eacute;eme &s;o much to afflict her: in this man|ner being conducted where the King, with many Princes
<PB REF="66"> and great Lords were &s;itting togethers, &s;hee demaunded which was the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince. Who hearing him&s;elfe named, immediately &s;tept foorth, demaunding what &s;h&eacute;e would with him: &s;hee pre&s;ently falling on her knees, fet|ching many vehement and d&eacute;epe &s;ighes, powring foorth &s;uch aboundance of teares, as a while detained the pa&s;&s;age of her &s;p&eacute;ech, which cau&s;ed great pitty in all the beholders, but e&s;pecially in the Prince, who naturally was very pit|tifull: at length hauing recouered the v&s;e of her tongue, with a d&eacute;epe &s;igh proc&eacute;eded in this manner. Mo&s;t worthy and valerous Prince, if the teares of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and wofulle&s;t creature in the world, may mooue pitty and com|pa&s;&s;ion, in your heroyick and noble minde, then let the&s;e my complaints haue acce&s;&s;e vnto your vertuous hart, which I haue heard reported to be &s;uch, that cau&s;eth me ra|ther then vnto any other of the&s;e noble Knights, to make my complaint, hoping by you to receaue &s;ome comfort in this my great heauine&s;&s;e, which hapned in this manner. Being &s;ent by the beautifull Dutches <HI>Gelnarda,</HI> Dutches of <HI>Strauonia</HI> vnto a friend of hers, who&s;e fame peraduen|ture you haue h&eacute;eretofore heard of, called <HI>Segando,</HI> who now remaines in the Kingdome of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> in the company of a beautifull Dam&s;ell, cleane forgetting both my Lady and her loue, which h&eacute;eretofore to him was e&s;teemed mo&s;t d&eacute;ere, my Lady hauing made diuers trialls for recouering of him, now as her la&s;t refuge &s;ent mee vnto him with a packet of letters, &amp; a ring which was of &s;uch vertue, that he &s;hould no &s;ooner haue put the &s;ame on his finger, but h&eacute;e &s;hould pre&s;ently be &s;o ouercome with her loue, y^t he &s;hould not be able to re&s;t quiet, vntill &s;uch time as he were com in|to her pre&s;ence. And now hauing trauelled through mo&s;t part of <HI>Italie,</HI> and comming into this Kingdome, not pa&s;&s;ing tenne leagues from this Citty, comming through a For|re&s;t, I was taken by almighty Giant, to me mo&s;t fearefull, who after hee had taken from mee the ca&s;ket with diuers Iewells that I had, he returned into a Caue from whence he came: this my Lord is the cau&s;e of my griefe, and like|wi&s;e
<PB REF="67"> will bee the death of the mo&s;t gentle&s;t Lady liuing, if you, or &s;ome other noble Knight take not pitty vpon vs, by &s;laying that vgly Giant, whereby I may regaine the ring: h&eacute;ere againe powred &s;hee foorth &s;uch aboundance of teares, as if her eyes had b&eacute;ene a fountaine, or liuely vel&s;pring, intermedling y^e &s;ame with &s;o many d&eacute;epe &s;ighes, as would haue mooued a flinty hart to compa&s;&s;ion: much more then thinke you did it mooue the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, who willing her to be of good comfort, promi&s;ed her that either he would worke her content, or loo&s;e him&s;elfe in aduenturing the &s;ame: for which with a demure and &s;ad countenance &s;h&eacute;e y&eacute;elded him harty thankes.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. How the Prince <HI>Don Edward</HI> departed from the Court, with the &s;orrowfull Dam&s;ell, and how comming into the For|re&s;t, he fought with the Giant <HI>Brandofell,</HI> and how he was taken pri&s;oner, for who&s;e mi&s;hap there was made great &s;orrow in the Court.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Prince hauing promi&s;ed helpe and &s;uccour, to that vilde counterfet Dam&s;ell, tooke order y^e next day to depart towards the Forre&s;t: in the meane time, com|ming vp into y^e Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emelias</HI> cham|ber, and falling into di&s;cour&s;e with her of this his intended iourny, from which &s;he greatly di&s;&s;waded him, her minde foretelling, the great damage which h&eacute;e &s;hould &s;u&s;taine thereby: but no di&s;&s;wations could preuaile with him h&eacute;erein, &s;o earne&s;t was he bent to follow this his cro&s;&s;e fortune, appointed to him by de&s;tenie: but after long &s;p&eacute;eches betw&eacute;ene them of this and other matters, they fell from talke to dalliance, &s;o that of a beautifull maiden, the Prince&s;&s;e became the faire&s;t woman in all <HI>Fraunce,</HI> at which time &s;he was conceaued of two goodly children, as you &s;hall reade of h&eacute;ereafter. Now let vs returne to our
<PB REF="67"> former purpo&s;e: the next day, no &s;ooner had the Sunne ri|&s;ing out of Dame <HI>Thetis</HI> lodging, mounted him&s;elfe on his neuer re&s;ting Chariot, but the valerous Prince being accompaned with the Dam&s;ell, and one Squire only, for more company he would not accept of, armed at all points &s;auing his Helme, which his Squire carried by rea&s;on of the heate: tooke his iourny towards the vnfortunate For|re&s;t. Mo&s;t part of the day rode they onwards, the Dam|&s;ell for the better hiding of her trechery, declared vnto him a large di&s;cour&s;e, of the loue betw&eacute;ene the Dutches her La|dy and Mi&s;tri&s;&s;e, and the Knight <HI>Sergando,</HI> with many his valerous and hauty d&eacute;edes of armes, whereof &s;ome part the Prince had heard of, which cau&s;ed him to giue the more credit to the re&s;t. Thus pa&s;&s;ed they away all that day, till comming vnto a &s;mall village, &s;ome two leagues di&s;tant from the Forre&s;t, euen about the time, that <HI>Phoebus</HI> with his golden beames, was &s;ome thr&eacute;e degr&eacute;es di&s;cended from y^e Meridian: and becau&s;e it was too late to combat with the Giant, they determined for that night to take vp their re&s;t, whereby the next day hee might not be altogether wearied with trauell, and al&s;o to haue if occa&s;ion &s;erued, the lon|ger time to fini&s;h the combat. Thus hauing taken vp their lodgings in a &s;mall cottage, they refre&s;hed them&s;elues with &s;uch viands as that Country village would afford: and after their repa&s;t, betaking them&s;elues to their re&s;t, where the Prince of all the night could &s;carcely inioy one &s;lumber, till towards the morning cloo&s;ing his eyes, he &s;lumbred a|little, in which hee thought that hee came before a goodly Ca&s;tle, one of the faire&s;t that euer he beheld, hauing but one entraunce which was at a &s;mall wicket, through which it &s;&eacute;emed vnto him, he &s;aw very many enter, but none to returne backe againe, at which hee &s;&eacute;emed very much to meruaile, and going about to enter, he &s;aw a mighty Gy|ant comming vnto him, the which &s;ight &s;o amazed him, that foorthwithall he wakened. And ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elfe, called his Squire vnto him, and demaunding whether it were day or no, he ro&s;e &amp; armed him&s;elfe: then taking a &s;mall repa&s;t, he
<PB REF="68"> departed towards the Forre&s;t, where hee arriued by the time that the &s;plendant Sunne with his gli&s;tring beames, beganne to light the earth, cau&s;ing a &s;iluer &s;howe appeare on the face thereof.</P>
<P>Long had hee not rode in this Forre&s;t, (mu&s;ing verie much what his dreame &s;hould meane, &s;ometimes imagi|ning that it fore&s;hewed &s;ome great mi&s;aduenture to in&s;ue, then wi&s;hing his dreame had continued, whereby he might haue had &s;ome notice of the end, as well as of the begin|ning) but the Dam&s;ell calling vnto him, told him, that now they were come euen vnto the place where the Gyant had robbed her, &amp; that &s;he doubted he was not farre of. Where|fore calling for his Helme, and cla&s;ping it on, taking his Launce in his hand, behold there appeared before his &s;ight the &s;ame Ca&s;tle, which in his dreame hee thought hee had &s;&eacute;ene: and ca&s;ting about his head, he &s;aw co~ming towards him a mighty Giant, the greate&s;t of &s;tature that euer he be|held, mounted on a Cour&s;er aun&s;werable to his weight, which cau&s;ed the Prince at the fir&s;t almo&s;t to be afraid, yet well con&s;idering the v&s;uall vnlu&s;tine&s;&s;e of tho&s;e huge mon|&s;ters, he tooke courage vnto him, minding to doe his vtter|mo&s;t to win him&s;elfe immortall fame, by vanqui&s;hing &s;o huge a lumpe.</P>
<P>The Giant comming n&eacute;ere vnto him, bidde him prouide him&s;elfe for the Combat, for that without leaue hee was come &s;o n&eacute;ere vnto theyr Ca&s;tle whereof he was appointed Gardant. The Prince immediatly replied, that &s;&eacute;eing h&eacute;e was by aduenture come thether, and b&eacute;eing offred y^e com|bat, which he was &s;ure would br&eacute;ede him immortall fame, he could doe no le&s;&s;e then accept therof. The~ &s;etting &s;purres to their hor&s;es, and placing their &s;laues in their re&s;ts, they met together with &s;uch furie, that breaking theyr Launces into a thou&s;and &s;hyuers, they mette with theyr bodies like|wi&s;e together &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they tumbled both hor&s;e and men to the ground, b&eacute;eing both greatly a&s;tonied with theyr rude incounter: and ri&s;ing from the ground, they betooke them to theyr &s;words, the Giant drawing forth a mightie
<PB REF="68"> Semiter, as much as another rea&s;onable Knight with one hand was able to lift from the ground: and brandi&s;hing the &s;ame about his head, began to deliuer many mighty blows at his enemie, which the Prince perceiuing, and fearing greatly to indure the &s;ame, not being by force able to with|&s;tand the &s;ame, auoyded them by the quicknes of his body, cau&s;ing him to &s;pend his might in vaine, and many times did hee both with thru&s;ts and blowes indanger his mightie aduer&s;arie, although his Armor were of pure &s;t&eacute;ele well|n&eacute;ere a finger thicke, which the Giant perceiuing, &amp; there|with growing inraged, hee determined with one blowe to end the conflict, and lifting vp his Semiter aloft, made of|fer of a blowe, which the Prince thought to take on his &s;hield, hoping to haue giuen him a wound in one of his legs in the meane time, as ind&eacute;ede he did, but the Giant hauing by this meanes a full blow at him, lighted vpon his &s;hield, cleauing it in two peeces, and pa&s;&s;ing farther, entering through both his Helme and coy&s;e of &s;t&eacute;ele, wounded him in the head, cau&s;ing him to r&eacute;ele backwards halfe a&s;toni&s;hed therewith: but yet recouering him&s;elfe before the Gyant could deliuer another blow, determined with the &s;kilfull Ma&s;&s;iue, who b&eacute;eing once to&s;&s;ed to his dammage, by the horne of the &s;turdy Bull, minding no more &s;o to indanger him&s;elfe with the like, begins to lie low on the ground, ther|by hoping both to auoyde his enemies might, and eake to be ready to take the lea&s;t aduantage when it &s;hould be offe|red: euen &s;o playd the valiant Prince, who to his co&s;t ha|uing made tryall of his enemies &s;trength, determined no more to hazard him&s;elfe to the like, tru&s;ted wholy to the quickne&s;&s;e of his body, which pollicie &s;erued him to good v&s;e, for thereby he cau&s;ed the hudge mon&s;ter, not onely to weary out him&s;elfe, by his multitude of blowes which hee be&s;towed in vaine, but al&s;o many time had the meanes, to giue him diuers great wounds, cau&s;ing his blood to i&s;&s;ue out in &s;uch abundant &s;ort, that the gr&eacute;ene gra&s;&s;e was dyed into a vermilion blu&s;h, as b&eacute;eing a&s;hamed, that humane men &s;hould haue &s;o little rea&s;on, as to &s;&eacute;eke the ruine and
<PB REF="69"> ouerthrow of each other, vpon &s;o &s;mall occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus continued the fight mo&s;t part of the day, no one knowing to whom victory would attaine, both of them b&eacute;e|ing wounded in many parts of their bodies, e&s;pecially the Giant, who by rea&s;on of the great effu&s;ion of blood, which he &s;u&s;tained, began to beare his &s;hielde low, and euen al|mo&s;t breathle&s;&s;e, the Prince b&eacute;eing in little better ca&s;e, was contented to &s;uffer him to take breath: and leaning awhile on theyr &s;words, the Giant told the Prince, that if he would y&eacute;eld vnto him, he would cau&s;e him to be v&s;ed with y^e grea|ter lenitie, otherwi&s;e, hee &s;hould expect nought &s;aue death. To which the Prince made no reply, but willing the Gi|ant to defend him&s;elfe, they renewed theyr Combat, which continued awhile with great fiercene&s;&s;e on both &s;ides. But at length, the Giant b&eacute;eing ouer-wearied, and fainting for want of blood, began againe to giue backe, which the prince perceiuing, and con&s;idering that to be long in conquering, would be the meanes that hee him&s;elfe in the end &s;hould be vanqui&s;hed, tooke Time by the front, and pur&s;uing the Giant, gaue him &s;uch a blow on the Helme, that it cau&s;ed him to r&eacute;ele: and before he could recouer him&s;elfe, hee gaue him another, which cau&s;ed him to fall to the ground. The Prince minding to follow his good fortune, &s;tooped to vn|lace his Helme, whereby he might haue parted his head fro~ his &s;houlders: but h&eacute;ereof hee was hindred by the mightie <HI>Purioll,</HI> who comming vnto him, willed him to giue ouer the vanqui&s;hed, and to defend him&s;elfe again&s;t the force of his arme.</P>
<P>The Prince looking about, and beholding his terrible countenaunce and ge&s;ture, began greatly to doubt, con&s;i|dering that already hee was ouer-wearied with his former Combat: then calling to mind the wordes of the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia</HI> at his departure, he wi&s;ked he had b&eacute;en ruled by her coun&s;ell, which if hee had followed, hee had not fallen into this vnlooked for mi&s;chiefe. And now againe ca&s;ting of all feare, the Giant b&eacute;eing come n&eacute;ere vnto him, he minded to &s;ell his life and liberty at as d&eacute;ere a rate at he could, deter|mining
<PB REF="69"> if he could, to prolong the fight as long as he might, hoping in the end to weary out that Giant, as he had doone <HI>Brandofell,</HI> but h&eacute;ereof he was deceiued, by rea&s;on that his wearines, together with his lo&s;&s;e of blood, had &s;o taken a|way the agilitie and quicknes of his body, that he was not able to auoyde the blowes &s;o lightly, but y^t the Giant many times met with him, cau&s;ing the blood to i&s;&s;ue forth in &s;un|dry places: and againe, his &s;trength was &s;o dimini&s;hed, that he could not (if at any time by aduantage hee hapned to &s;trike the Giant) &s;o much as once pierce his ma&s;&s;y Ar|mor. Thus continued they by the &s;pace of halfe an howre, the Prince euer receiuing wound vppon wound, vntill at length, b&eacute;eing altogether wearied with his ouer-long tra|uell, (as hauing continued in fight from &s;eauen of y^e clocke in the morning, vntill fiue in the afternoone, and hauing lo&s;t great aboundance of blood,) gathered all his forces togea|ther, and minding before hee died, to indamage his enemie what he could, &s;trake at the Giant, which he auoyding, the blow di&s;cended to the ground: and the Prince not beeing able to recouer his might, b&eacute;eing &s;o farre &s;pent, fell there|with to the ground al&s;o in a traunce. Which the Giant be|holding, and (contrary to his nature) pittying his ouer|throw, con&s;idering the great vallour which he had &s;&eacute;ene in him, went and pulled off his Helme to giue him ayre, and taking him vppe in his armes, carried him into the Ca&s;tle, where he was layd on a good bedde, and his wounds care|fully looked vnto. For Syr <HI>Pe&s;trill,</HI> who vnder the Duke his Co&s;in was Commaunder of the Ca&s;tle, was a very vertuous Knight, and one who greatly pittied the Princes captiuity: con&s;idering what greefe would thereby ri&s;e, both to the King, and all the Nobilitie of <HI>Fraunce.</HI> He al&s;o cau|&s;ed the body of the Giant <HI>Brandofell</HI> to be brought in and cured: who&s;e wounds though they were many and great, yet were there none of them mortall. The Dam&s;ell &s;&eacute;eing things &s;ort according to her minde, departed away highly contented.</P>
<P>Now returne we to the Princes Squyre, who hauing
<PB REF="70"> beheld this vnhappy ouer-throw of his Mai&s;ter, together with his impri&s;onment, not knowing whether hee were li|uing or dead, fared like a man out of his wits, and ran ra|ging vp and downe the Forre&s;t, crying and exclaiming a|gain&s;t fortune, and the de&s;tinies which had permitted &s;uch great inui&s;tice: and at length, the morning being come, h&eacute;e determined to returne vnto the Citty of <HI>Parris,</HI> where the next day he arriued, and comming vnto the King, before him and all the nobles of the Court, hee recounted his Ma&s;ters mi&s;aduenture, together with all that hapned in the battaile with y^e two Giants: which bred &s;uch a griefe and amazedne&s;&s;e in all the hearers, as well you may iudge if the like euent &s;hould hapen. Euery one determining to hazard their liues, or to &s;et him fr&eacute;e if he liued, all conclu|ding it to be an inchauntment, knowing that in that place, there was neuer any Ca&s;tle heard of.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How the Prince of <HI>Saxonie</HI> remaining, di&s;content in his fa|thers Court after the departure of <HI>Euordanus:</HI> departed &s;ecretly as a Knight arrant, to &s;eeke aduentures.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu may remember how di&s;contented the <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince tooke the departure of his &s;uppo&s;ed brother, the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t: who hauing &s;&eacute;ene him aboord, &amp; being againe returned vnto the Court, beganne to waxe &s;o melancholy, that hee &s;&eacute;emed to take delight in nothing, although the Duke his father perceauing it, and for remedy for the &s;ame, deui&s;ed all the meanes he could to worke his content, as by procla|ming Iu&s;ts and turnaments, wherein he h&eacute;eretofore was wont to receaue great content, and other times hunting of the wilde Boare, and &s;uch other exerci&s;es, &s;till fearing his departure.</P>
<P>But neither this, nor yet the delightfull company of the Prince&s;&s;e his &s;i&s;ter, whom he intirely loued, could in any &s;ort worke him that content, which he was wont to receaue in the company of the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t: who&s;e want, together with the de&s;ire of following &s;trange aduen|tures, wherein he hoped to atchieue immortall renowne, by his valiant and heroick d&eacute;edes, which hee doubted not but &s;o performe, increa&s;ed in him &s;uch an ardent de&s;ire to trauell. Whereof many times being denaied by the Duke his Father, at length hauing re&s;olued with him&s;elfe to de|part, he called vnto him one of his Squires whom hee in|tirely loued, and on who&s;e &s;ecre&s;ie and good &s;eruice, hee more depended then on any other, and declaring vnto him his determination, willed him to prouide for their depar|ture, which &s;hould bee with all the &s;ecre&s;ie that might b&eacute;e. His Squire, hauing vnder&s;toode his Mai&s;ters re&s;olution, departed to prouide for the &s;ame, and comming to the har|bor, found a &s;hip ready bound for <HI>England:</HI> and agr&eacute;eing
<PB REF="71"> with the mai&s;ter thereof for their pa&s;&s;age, the next night con|uayed aboord both hor&s;e and armor, and &s;uch other things as &s;hould bee requi&s;ite for their iourny: and hauing infor|med the Prince h&eacute;ereof, the next day, the Prince being ac|companied only with his Squire, as many times he was accu&s;tomed, departed from the Pallace, not &s;u&s;pected of any one, hauing left in his chamber window, a letter written to his father, declaring therein the cau&s;e of his depar|ture. Thus walking a foote, they arriued towards euening at the port where the &s;hippe ancored, and comming aboord, hauing the winde faire, they &s;et &s;aile, directing their cour&s;e for <HI>Douer,</HI> of which harbor the &s;hippe was. Thus beeing at Sea, and hauing the winde and weather faire, y^e Prince betooke him&s;elfe to &s;l&eacute;epe, being with cares ouerwatched, for in thr&eacute;e nights before he had not &s;lept, &s;o earne&s;t was his minde bent on this his iourny: and now being as h&eacute;e thought in &s;ecurity from being &s;topped of his purpo&s;e, h&eacute;e &s;lept &s;oundly, till it was towards the morning, when h&eacute;e thought there appeared before his &s;ight, y^e beautifulle&s;t La|dy that euer he beheld: who comming vnto him, ca&s;t her|&s;elfe into his armes, de&s;iring his protection again&s;t a fierce and vgly Giant, who pur&s;ued her. The Prince h&eacute;erewith awaking, beganne to ponder with him&s;elfe, concerning his dreame, mu&s;ing what it might &s;ignifie, but the beauty and comly grace of the Lady, &s;tucke &s;o fa&s;t in his memory, that by no meanes he could put y^e &s;ame out of his minde: which cau&s;ed him in the end, to conclude, that it mu&s;t n&eacute;edes b&eacute;e &s;ome Lady, whom the de&s;tinies had ordained him to loue, determined to y&eacute;eld him&s;elfe pri&s;oner, before the a&s;&s;ault &s;hould grow too hote: thus continued this amerous young Prince, intangled in her beauty whom he neuer had &s;&eacute;ene, minding to re&s;t in no place, vntill &s;uch time as he had found her out, whom in his dreame he beheld. By this time had they continued at Sea by the &s;pace of eight daies, not m&eacute;e|ting with any aduenture worth the memory, hauing the winde faire, and the Seas &s;o calme as might b&eacute;e, till on the ninth day comming almo&s;t on &s;hore on y^e cao&s;t of <HI>Fraunce,</HI>
<PB REF="71"> they perceaued a &s;hippe with &s;ailes and ores, as much as they could to make towards them: which the Mai&s;ter and the re&s;t of the Saylers, pre&s;ently knewe to be a Pyrat, and calling the Prince vnto them, to knowe what coun&s;ell h&eacute;e would giue in this extremitie, they all beeing minded to y&eacute;eld, rather then to fight, con&s;idering the vnequalne&s;&s;e of the match, and the cruelty the Pyrats commonly v&s;ed to tho&s;e, who made re&s;i&s;tance. But the Prince not minding to &s;ubmit him&s;elfe into the hands of &s;uch villaines, gaue them coun&s;ell not to y&eacute;eld, but to fight it out to y^e la&s;t man, and calling for his Armor, immediatly armed him&s;elfe: &s;wearing them all to performe their be&s;t indeuours, for to defend them&s;elues.</P>
<P>By this time was the Pirate come vp with them, and warning them to y&eacute;elde vnto his mercie, the Prince &s;tand|ing aloft vppon the decke, with his &s;word drawne in his hand, &amp; his &s;hield vpon his arme, replied, that they meant to defend them&s;elues, as not b&eacute;eing accu&s;tomed with wordes to be daunted. The Pirat <HI>Geroll</HI> hearing this aun&s;were, commaunded to grapple with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hyp. The prince at the fir&s;t incountring with a great lubber, who proffered to leape aboord their &s;hyp, gaue him &s;o &s;ound a blow on the &s;conte, that it cau&s;ed him out of the &s;hrowdes to tumble headlong into the Sea, and after him another, and another: &s;o that in the part of the &s;hip where h&eacute;e was, the fight began to grow exc&eacute;eding hote, many of the Pirats &s;ouldiers b&eacute;e|ing gotten aboord, but by the helpe of his Squire, and the Mai&s;ters mate, who was a lu&s;tie fellow, they quickly cl&eacute;e|red theyr &s;hippe againe, and the Prince hauing receiued a wound by one of the Pyrats, who was aboord theyr owne &s;hyp, not knowing which way to be reuenged, leapt foorth|with into theyr &s;hyp, &amp; b&eacute;eing inraged, laid on &s;uch blowes, that euery one thought him&s;elfe happie&s;t when they were farthe&s;t from him: for by this time there were &s;laine aboue twenty of the Pirats. Which <HI>Geroll</HI> perceiuing, &amp; know|ing right well that if the Knight were &s;laine, he &s;hould ea&s;i|ly vanqui&s;h the re&s;t: and hoping to performe it with his
<PB REF="72"> owne hands, he came &s;tealing behind him, but the Prince who was ordained to fini&s;h greater matters, perceiuing his intent, turned his face towards him, giuing him &s;uch a &s;a|lutation with his &s;word, that it cau&s;ed him to bend with one of his kn&eacute;es euen to the deck.</P>
<P>Now began betw&eacute;ene them two a mo&s;t cruell Combat, the Pyrat b&eacute;eing a &s;trong and lu&s;tie fellow, &amp; one that had foughten many dangerous battels, and al&s;o b&eacute;eing ayded by tho&s;e of his partie, a&s;&s;aulted the Prince with great fury, and were as gallantly by him re&s;i&s;ted, to theyr no &s;mal pre|iudice: for within le&s;&s;e then halfe an howre, hee had &s;laine &s;ixe of them, wounding y^e re&s;t very grieuou&s;ly. And by this time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, hauing tackt about, came to the re|&s;cue of the Prince, which &s;o di&s;mayed the Pyrats, that b&eacute;e|ing but tenne of them left aliue, and they for the mo&s;t part hurt, as before-&s;aid, determined to intreate for mercy, and falling downe vpon theyr kn&eacute;es, be&s;ought the Prince with one voyce to &s;aue theyr liues: which he ea&s;ily y&eacute;elded vnto. And taking cour&s;e for the &s;afe cu&s;todie of the &s;hyp, they ha|uing with great deuotion giuen thankes vnto almighty GOD for this &s;o happy victory, which they had &s;o luc|kily obtained without the lo&s;&s;e of any one man, &amp; dre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e that were hurt, with &s;uch &s;alues and other n&eacute;edfull things, whereof they found good &s;tore aboord the Pyrat, they directed theyr cour&s;e for <HI>Douer,</HI> where the next day they &s;afely arriued: where the Prince, at the reque&s;t of the Ow|ner of the Ship, &s;tayed by the &s;pace of three dayes, during which time, there arriued many of the Country people to behold him: for by this time was his fame &s;pred abroad by the Marriners, to his great renowne. And the Lieuete|nant that had the gouernment of that Fort vnder the King of <HI>England,</HI> b&eacute;eing then returned from certaine affayres which he had to doe, entertained him with the greate&s;t ho|nour that might be. To whom the Prince would not make him&s;elfe knowne, but as a Knight arrant, minding to tra|uell to the Court of the King of <HI>England,</HI> the fame whereof had brought him from his natiue Country.</P>
<PB REF="72">
<P>And now hauing re&s;ted him&s;elfe by the &s;pace of tenne dayes, for the curing of &s;uch wounds as he had receiued in the former conflict, and &s;&eacute;eing the Pyrats executed, accor|ding to the Lawes of that Realme, determined to depart the next day towards <HI>London,</HI> where the King then kept his Court, hauing remained a long time in great pen&s;iue|ne&s;&s;e for the lo&s;&s;e of his &s;onne Prince <HI>Edward.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Howe <HI>Jago</HI> comming to the Engli&s;h Court, tooke in hand the defence of a Lady fal&s;ly accu&s;ed: and what hapned thereof.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing taken his leaue of the Gouernour of <HI>Douer,</HI> tooke his way directly towards <HI>London,</HI> accompanied onely with his Squire, vnto whom for the more plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ing of the time, hee re|counted his dreame, in a vi&s;ion which h&eacute;e had &s;&eacute;ene at his comming out of <HI>Saxony.</HI> Thus pa&s;t they away theyr weari&s;ome iourney, till on the fourth day com|ming within fiue miles of the Citty, they heard one mo&s;t pittifully w&eacute;eping: and drawing &s;omewhat n&eacute;ere the &s;ame, there b&eacute;eing a high banke betw&eacute;ene them and the voyce which they heard, they &s;tayed awhile to vnder&s;tand the cau&s;e of that lamentation. When &s;uddenly they might heare the w&eacute;eping cea&s;e, and the party to fetch a d&eacute;epe and grieuous &s;igh, &s;aying: Is it po&s;&s;ible, that God will alto|gether for&s;ake the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed innocent, and &s;uffer &s;uch great iniu&s;tice, not ray&s;ing vp any one to helpe or &s;uccour theyr rightfull cau&s;e again&s;t &s;o euident a trea&s;on: O y^t it would plea&s;e him to rai&s;e vp another <HI>Daniell,</HI> to find out theyr ac|cur&s;ed forgeries, and to fr&eacute;e this his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Su&s;anna,</HI> or that it would plea&s;e his almighty power, to indue m&eacute;e with &s;trength and courage, whereby I might force them to con|fe&s;&s;e theyr mo&s;t wrongfull and fal&s;e accu&s;ation, again&s;t the mo&s;t vertuous Lady liuing: but alas, I &s;&eacute;e mine own for|ces,

<P>And <HI>Iago</HI> mounting vp the banke, perceiued that &s;hee was a comely young Gentlewoman, whom hee &s;aluted, and b&eacute;eing by her againe re&s;aluted, he demaunded y^e cau&s;e of her griefe, which by her complaint he imagined to be ve|ry great: a&s;&s;uring her withall, that if the matter were cor|re&s;pondent vnto truth, and to be tryed by dint of &s;word, &s;he had met with one, who would willingly hazard his life in defence of the innocent. The Dam&s;ell hearing his kind proffer, and withall, viewing the comly proportion of his body, began &s;omewhat to comfort her&s;elfe, hoping y^t God had &s;ent him of purpo&s;e, to defend the iu&s;t cau&s;e of her di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady, an&s;wered him.

<P>Hauing written the&s;e ver&s;es vnto his Lady, he departed, what &s;ithence hath hapned vnto him I doe not know, but imagine he hath &s;ped as ill as tho&s;e, who h&eacute;eretofore haue made triall of the &s;ame aduenture. Now being departed, there was another gallant, which likewi&s;e fell in liking with my Lady <HI>Beleriza,</HI> one whom ind&eacute;ede the inheritance of my Lord their father, if they both hapned to die with|out i&s;&s;ue, of right did appertaine. This gallant called <HI>Signi|or Roberto,</HI> imagining that my Lord their father, and his kin&s;man was either deade, or neuer to be deliuered, de|ui&s;ed which way to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elfe of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: and thinking if hee could deui&s;e how to obtaine my Lady to b&eacute;e his wife, the matter were in a manner a&s;&s;ured, con&s;ide|ring that her brother, who&s;e name was likewi&s;e called <HI>Ro|berto,</HI> being a man of a valient and hauty minde, would hazard him&s;elfe in the aduenture of the Inchaunted Ca|&s;tle, wherein he did not doubt, but that he would be eyther &s;laine, or taken pri&s;oner, and then of right it &s;hould apper|taine vnto him. And b&eacute;eing re&s;olued h&eacute;ereon, hee v&s;ed all
<PB REF="74"> the meanes he could to obtaine her liking. But &s;he hauing &s;etled her affection, as is before &s;ayd, on <HI>Don Franci&s;co,</HI> made &s;mall or no account him: which he perceauing, tur|ned all his fained loue into hatred, deui&s;ing which way to bring to pa&s;&s;e by trechery, that which he could not hope for by the loue of my Lady, which in the end he thus brought to pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Hauing many times animated his Co&s;in <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> to hazard him&s;elfe for the deliuery of my Lord his father, which the young Gentleman him&s;elfe, had a great de&s;ire vnto, and now hauing taken the order of Knighthoode, and made preparation for his iourny into <HI>Fraunce:</HI> and being accompanied the Sea-&s;ide, through which he mu&s;t n&eacute;edes pa&s;&s;e, was at vnwares &s;et on by a cupple of villaines, and before he could drawe his &s;word, was by them &s;laine: his Squire flying away, with in le&s;&s;e then a mile, met with this graund homicide, his Mai&s;ters kin&s;man, vnto whom he recounted the murder of his Mai&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Don Roberto</HI> hearing this, making as if he had grieued thereat mightily, rai&s;ing the Country to apprehend tho&s;e murtherers, the one of them taking a Riuer, hoping there|by to e&s;cape, was drowned therein: the other being taken, was knowne to bee a &s;eruant to the traytor <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> who comming where he was, after he had priuatly talked with him, and in&s;tructed him what he &s;hould &s;ay, examined him openly, where the villaine mo&s;t fal&s;ely auouched, that they were hired to commit this murder, by my Lady <HI>Beleriza,</HI> which hee no &s;ooner had confe&s;&s;ed, but <HI>Don Ro|berto,</HI> fearing lea&s;t the feare of death &s;hould make him in the end to confe&s;&s;e the truth, with his ponyard &s;uddenly &s;tabbed him to the hart. Then po&s;ting to the Court, h&eacute;e cau&s;ed my Lady to be apprehended, accu&s;ing her before the King of the murder of her brother, which alas, was more grieuious vnto her, then the &s;entence of her owne death, which pre&s;ently by the King was pronounced again&s;t her: if that within twelue months &s;hee were not prouided of a
<PB REF="75"> Knight, who in combat with <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> &s;hould main|taine her innocencie. And now there is not pa&s;&s;ing tenne daies to come of the prefixed time, &s;hee good Lady not ha|uing any one, who will hazard him&s;elfe for her deliuerance, although &s;he is greatly pittied of euery one: yet &s;o much is the number of good and hardy Knights in this Kingdome abated, by the occa&s;ion of the Princes lo&s;&s;e, that there is &s;carce any one thought able to matche the traytor in &s;ingle fight. Loe h&eacute;ere mo&s;t noble Knight, haue I as n&eacute;ere as I can, declared vnto you the truth: hoping that God will &s;o guide your minde, as to vndertake the defence, of the mo&s;t vertuous and &s;orrowfull <HI>Beleriza.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing attentiuely li&s;tned vnto her whole di&s;cour&s;e, by which he a&s;&s;ured him&s;elfe of the inno|cencie of the Lady, bad her recomfort her&s;elfe, for if at his arriuall at the Court, by inquiry hee &s;hould finde the mat|ter to be as &s;he had declared, hee would, if <HI>Beleriza</HI> would accept of him as her Champion, hazard his body for her defence, not doubting but to make her accu&s;er confe&s;&s;e his trea&s;on again&s;t her. Thus taking the Dam&s;ell w^t him, they rode towards the Citty, where they arriued a little before night: The next day hauing re&s;ted him&s;elfe, and viewed the &s;tateline&s;&s;e of the Citty, which to him &s;&eacute;emed the good|lie&s;t that euer he beheld, hee did what he might to inquire, the truth of the Ladies impri&s;onment: where by diuers he was informed in the &s;ame, euen as the Dam&s;ell had decla|red vnto him. Thus hauing &s;tayed &s;ome foure or fiue daies in the Citty, being continually vi&s;ited by the Dam&s;ell, and now being throughly re&s;olued of the innocencie of her La|dy, was de&s;irous to &s;&eacute;e her, &amp; to know whether &s;he would accept of him as her Champion. And being by the Dam&s;ell conuaied vnto the place where &s;hee remained impri&s;oned, he was by her mo&s;t kindly welcomed, giuing him a thou|&s;and thankes for his proffered kindne&s;&s;e, by her not any waies de&s;erued, and admitting him for her Champion, &s;he &s;ayd. Noble Knight, I heere fr&eacute;ely deliuer vnto you, the de|fence both of my life and honor, de&s;iring God no other way

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. How the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> fought with <HI>Roberto,</HI> and cau&s;ed him to confe&s;&s;e his trea&s;on again&s;t <HI>Beleriza.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe day being come in which the beautifull <HI>Beleriza.</HI> was either to pre&s;ent her Champi|on, or &s;uffer death, for the &s;urmi&s;ed mur|ther of her brother. The King with diuers of his Nobles, being already placed on their &s;caffold to behold the battaile: the pri&s;oner was brought fourth attired all in blacke, hauing a farre white Laune ca&s;t ouer hee head, being accompanied with many beauti|full Ladies of the Court, attired al&s;o in mourning appa|rell, bewailing her mi&s;fortune: thus was &s;hee conducted vnto a &s;caffold appointed for her, after her came the Appe|lant, mounted on a &s;tately bay cour&s;er, all in tauny armor, as &s;orrowing for the death of his kin&s;man. And comming before the King, bending him&s;elfe in his Saddle, as doing obedience to his Maie&s;tie, &s;pake as followeth. Mo&s;t dread Soueraigne, I humbly be&s;&eacute;ech you to cau&s;e that dete&s;table murtherer, either pre&s;ently to bring foorth her Champion, if &s;he be of any one prouided, whom I may foorthwith, to y^e manife&s;tation of her crime ouercome, or if &s;he be not pro|uided, that then according to the lawe &s;hee be foorthwith executed.</P>
<PB REF="76">
<P>The King di&s;liking this is pre&s;umption, as al&s;o greatly affecting <HI>Beleriza,</HI> for her fathers &s;ake, &s;ayd. <HI>Signior Rober|to,</HI> I know not whether y^e pri&s;oner be prepared of a Cham|pion or no, but your pre&s;umptious boldne&s;&s;e, in going a|bout to teach mee what I haue to doe, cau&s;eth me thinke that your great pride will &s;oone take a fall, for you might well haue &s;tayed your ha&s;t, vntill I had cau&s;ed the trum|pets, according to the v&s;e of Armes, to &s;ummon the deffen|dant: and then if he had not come foorth at the third &s;um|mons, you might boldly haue demaunded iu&s;tice.</P>
<P>Then &s;taying a while, the trumpets were willed to &s;ound to warne the defendant, who foorthwith being mounted on a milke white St&eacute;ede, his Armor all gr&eacute;ene, be&s;et with Cou&s;lips of gold, and bearing in his &s;hield in an Azure field a beautifull Lady, with his word in letters of gold, <HI>Vbi ne&s;cio:</HI> repre&s;enting thereby, the Lady whom he &s;awe in his dreame. In this manner entred hee the Li&s;ts, and trotting with a comly &s;oft pace towards the King, with his Beauer lifted vp, to whom he did reuerence, demaunding which was the Knight, who had &s;o fal&s;ely accu&s;ed the &s;or|rowfull Lady. The King beholding his comly grace, and perceauing by his &s;p&eacute;ech that he was a &s;tranger, mo&s;t cour|tiou&s;ly, &s;howed him <HI>Signior Roberto:</HI> vnto whom <HI>Iago</HI> &s;pake as followeth.</P>
<P>Sir Knight, I doe not a little meruaile, how you b&eacute;eing a man honorably di&s;cended, could harbor &s;o ba&s;e and vild a thought, as to accu&s;e this Lady your kin&s;woman, of a murder wherein your &s;elfe &s;&eacute;emeth to be an Actor, other|wi&s;e you would not &s;o &s;uddenly haue killed that wicked homicide your &s;eruant, but haue &s;uffred him to haue liued, and openly to haue confe&s;&s;ed that, which you in your con|&s;cience did greatly feare hee would denie: but I doubt not but God, by my arme, will manife&s;t that, which by his death you did hope to haue concealed. <HI>Roberto</HI> ray&s;ing him &s;elfe in his &s;tirrups, and raging to be &s;o touched with the truth, and tru&s;ting in his owne might and force, replyed in this manner.</P>
<PB REF="76">
<P>Foole-hardy Knight, thou &s;halt &s;oone know what thy fol|ly hath gained, by b&eacute;eing allured with her lookes to hazard thy life in a cau&s;e &s;o vniu&s;t as this is which thou doo&s;t de|fend, and how farre thy fal&s;e and opprobrious &s;p&eacute;eches hath incen&s;ed my choller again&s;t th&eacute;e, that whe~ as recreant thou &s;halt a&s;ke mercy, in &s;t&eacute;ed thereof thou &s;halt receiue cruell death. The King hearing the&s;e proude &s;p&eacute;eches, comman|ded the Iudges of y^e field to take the othes of both knights, then the trumpets &s;ounding, warned the~ to prepare to the battell. Thus b&eacute;eing by the Iudges placed in the li&s;ts, ha|uing wind and &s;unne equally di&s;tributed vnto them, they &s;et &s;purres to their hor&s;es, &amp; placing theyr Launces in theyr re&s;ts, they met together with &s;uch fury, that breaking their &s;taues to theyr hands, <HI>Roberto</HI> was throwne fro~ his hor&s;e, and the Prince hauing likewi&s;e lo&s;t one of his &s;tirrups, pa&s;|&s;ed on without any great &s;emblance of moouing: and com|ming to the end of his cour&s;e, turning about his hor&s;e, hee &s;aw <HI>Signior Roberto</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elfe for the foote com|bat: which he no &s;ooner perceiued, but alighting from his hor&s;e, &amp; drawing foorth his &s;word, went to m&eacute;et him, where betw&eacute;ene them began a mo&s;t cruell and doubtfull combat, no man knowing to which party victory was like to in&s;ue, <HI>Don Roberto</HI> b&eacute;eing a very &s;trong and mightie Knight, layd on blowes amaine, as tru&s;ting in his great &s;trength, which &s;urely was much, and had hee beene indued as well with vertue as vallour, he might well haue b&eacute;ene e&s;t&eacute;emed for one of the be&s;t Knights in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Iago,</HI> on the other &s;ide, b&eacute;eing very nimble &amp; quicke of body, although not altogether &s;o &s;trong as his enemy, a|uoyded his blowes with very great &s;kill, many times wounding his aduer&s;ary, both with thru&s;ts and blowes, him&s;elfe &s;ometimes receiuing wounds likewi&s;e: &s;o that the ground was be&s;princkled with theyr blood, which i&s;&s;ued out in many places through theyr Armor. Thus continu|ed they by the &s;pace of one whole howre, neuer &s;o much as once taking breath, by which time their Armor was broken in many places, e&s;pecially that of the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> which
<PB REF="77"> b&eacute;eing not altogether of the be&s;t, though gallant to the eye, was broken the &s;ooner with his huge blowes: although on the contrary &s;ide, <HI>Roberto</HI> had receiued more great &amp; dan|gerous wounds, through the thru&s;ts which the Prince had made. And now b&eacute;eing both breathle&s;&s;e, they re&s;ted them|&s;elues awhile, viewing each other, and &s;tudying which way mo&s;t how to indammage his aduer&s;ary. At length, they ha|uing well re&s;ted the~&s;elues, they fell to theyr combat afre&s;h, the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> &s;&eacute;eming more lu&s;tie and quicke then at the beginning, began now to follow his aduer&s;ary with many mighty blowes and &s;harpe thru&s;ts, cau&s;ing him in a man|ner, nothing but to defend him&s;elfe: and imagining ind&eacute;ed that he was not long able to continue, very vnadui&s;edly pur&s;ued him with blowes and thru&s;ts, not hauing any re|gard to defend him&s;elfe, but to offend his foe. Which <HI>Ro|berto</HI> perceiuing, gaue him &s;o cruell a blow on y^e right &s;ide, that pearcing his Armor, which was not of &s;ufficient force to defend the might of his arme, wounded him to the bone: which the Prince f&eacute;eling, and con&s;idering that it came by his ra&s;h carele&s;ne&s;&s;e, determined to haue a greater regard to him&s;elfe: &amp; following his fortune with good adui&s;ement, gaue <HI>Don Roberto</HI> to vnder&s;tand, that y^e blow was to him a good &s;choole point, &s;o that at length hauing driuen him from place to place, b&eacute;eing no longer able to with&s;tand his force, hauing lo&s;t great abundance of blood, hee fell on his knees, de&s;iring him to &s;aue his life, and he would confe&s;&s;e y^e whole truth.</P>
<P>The Prince h&eacute;ereunto &s;oone granted, and bringing him before the King, <HI>Roberto</HI> confe&s;&s;ed, fir&s;t how he had deui&s;ed to come vnto the inhearitance of the Lord <HI>Mowbray</HI> his kin&s;man, by marrying with his daughter, and afterwards b&eacute;eing by her refu&s;ed, how he had deui&s;ed this meanes, as in the former Chapter is declared. Which when the King with the re&s;t of the Lords there pre&s;ent had heard, they did not a little meruaile hereat: and pre&s;ently cau&s;ing the La|dy <HI>Beleriza</HI> to be fet, and greatly honoured, extolling the &s;trange Knight highly, the King demaunded of <HI>Beleriza</HI> of
<PB REF="77"> whence and what he was: to which &s;he aun&s;wered that &s;he knew not. Then the King demaunded of him&s;elfe of what Country he was. And he very curteou&s;ly aun&s;wered him, that he was borne in the Dukedom of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and hauing giuen his mind to trauell, was commonly called the Knight of Fortune: and now hapning to arriue to this Country, and comming to view this Court, the &s;tatelines whereof he had many times before heard of, was by chance giuen to vnder&s;tand, the wrong which was doone vnto <HI>Beleriza</HI> by her Co&s;in <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> and con&s;idering that it is the part of all Knights to defend the innocent, e&s;pecially Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are not able to defend them&s;elues, I vndertooke the &s;ame, which by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of y^e Almigh|tie I haue accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The King hearing this his &s;p&eacute;ech, which he vttered with a mo&s;t comly grace, greatly commended him in his hart: and giuing charge vnto his Surgions for the curing of his wounds, wherof he had great n&eacute;ede, he determined to pro|c&eacute;ede in iudgement again&s;t <HI>Signior Roberto.</HI> But hee by this time, through the many grieuous and mortal wounds which he had receiued, had giuen vp the gho&s;t: whereby he preuented the King of inflicting the puni&s;hment which hee worthily de&s;erued, and which a&s;&s;uredly, if he had liued, h&eacute;e &s;hold haue &s;uffered. But now &s;&eacute;eing he was already dead, the King commaunded him to be buried in the &s;ame place where the battel was fought, cau&s;ing him to be layd for the honour of the Hou&s;e, from whence hee was di&s;cended, in a Tombe of Marble, very curiou&s;ly wrought, with this E|pitaph written thereon.</P>

And now hauing fetcht their ca|rere, met together with &s;uch force, that their Launces were broken into a thou&s;and &s;hiuers, the &s;plinters thereof flying into the aire, them&s;elues both pa&s;&s;ing on without any mo|tion of moouing in their Saddles: and hauing ended their cour&s;e, and turning about their hor&s;es, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> intreated the Knight of the Lions, to breake a &s;taffe or two more, vntill &s;uch time as one of them were di&s;mounted, to which he willingly agreed: and at y^e commaundement of <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> there was a bundle of Launces brought, the Knight being willed to chu&s;e fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Then running againe, they incountred with &s;uch force, that <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> loo&s;ing both his &s;tirrups, was likewi&s;e forced to take hold by his hor&s;e mane, the other b&eacute;eing in the &s;ame &s;ort driuen to take hold, hauing lo&s;t his right &s;tirrup, &amp; &s;he

On the other&s;ide, the Knight of the Lyons calling to his minde his beloued Lady the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> &s;aid: D&eacute;ere La|dy, &s;&eacute;e h&eacute;ere thy f&eacute;eble Knight, as it were mated by this fal&s;e <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> nay, onely the feare of your di&s;like, is the cau&s;e that he hath b&eacute;ene able to indure again&s;t me: but I be&s;&eacute;ech you call to minde your former kindne&s;&s;es, and confirme the &s;ame with your con&s;tant a&s;&s;urance, and then I doubt not but to be well able to vanqui&s;h this Knight, whom for his vallor I cannot chu&s;e but loue.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;p&eacute;eches on both &s;ides were &s;carce ended, when m&eacute;eting together, they brake theyr &s;taues hard home to theyr Gauntlets, and m&eacute;eting with theyr bodies, they ru|&s;hed together in &s;uch &s;ort, that theyr hor&s;es had much to doo to &s;tand vnder them, but were forced to ramble backwards, but at length, hauing recouered them&s;elues, the Knights b&eacute;eing both wearied with theyr rough incou~ters, not mind|ing any more to Iu&s;t, drew foorth theyr &s;words, and pre|paring them&s;elues to the Combat, the Knight of the Ly|ons was the fir&s;t that a&s;&s;ayled his aduer&s;ary: and tutching his hor&s;e with his left &s;purre, came clo&s;e with <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> deliuering him &s;uch a blow on the &s;hield, that &s;lyeing away a great part thereof, wounded him a little on the left thygh: which <HI>Don Adre&s;to,</HI> &s;oone requited, for comming in with his left &s;ide, and making as if he would haue giuen a thru&s;t at his body, &s;uddenly by the agillity and quickne&s;&s;e of his
<PB REF="80"> hor&s;e, he was on the other &s;ide of him, and deliuered a full blowe at his head, taking him &s;o &s;ound a knocke, that had it not b&eacute;ene for the goodne&s;&s;e of his Armor, he had then en|ded the battaile: but the Armor beeing of approoued good|ne&s;&s;e &s;aued his Mai&s;ter from any hurt, although y^e weight thereof did halfe a &s;tony him, but comming &s;oone to his me|mory, &amp; rai&s;ing him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrupps, he gaue <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> a mighty blowe, which had he not warded with his &s;hield, had a&s;&s;uredly claue him to the t&eacute;eth, for notwith&s;tanding, the goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;hield, which was of pure &amp; well tem|pered &s;teele: he claue it in the mid&s;t, and entring through both Helme and coyfe, wounded him in the head, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of his &s;ences. Thus continued they a great while with equall odds, not one knowing which had the a vantage: for although <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> had receaued many wounds, yet the vertue of the King which he weare on his finger was &s;uch, that he lo&s;t not one droppe of blood: Thus hauing continued by the &s;pace of two houres, at la&s;t the Knight of the Lions, hauing giuen him a mighty blowe on the head, which cau&s;ed him as one in a traunce to r&eacute;ele on his hor&s;e, and before &s;uch time as he could recouer him|&s;elfe, hauing deliuered another blowe betw&eacute;ene his head &amp; &s;houlders, cau&s;ed him to fall from his hor&s;e in a traunce, which the Knight of the Lions perceauing, immediatly di&s;mounted, thinking to haue taken off his Helme, and to haue giuen him ayre, but before hee could come vnto him, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> had recouered his f&eacute;ete, and taking vp his &s;word, which hung by a &s;mall chayne fa&s;tned vnto his arme, &s;ayd: Knight of the Lyons, I had thought before this time there had not b&eacute;en any Knight able to match mee on hor&s;ebacke, but now I find my &s;elfe deceiued: wherfore I &s;uppo&s;e thou mai&s;t thanke thine Armorer, which hath &s;o well fitted th&eacute;e, but I doubt not now beeing on foote, to deale with you &s;ome what better. It is well &s;ayd, an&s;wered the other, and were not my cau&s;e more iu&s;t then thine, I &s;hould greatly feare mee of the victory: but con&s;idering the wrong which thou doo&s;t vnto that vertuous Lady <HI>Lenarda,</HI> it cau&s;eth mee to
<PB REF="80"> hope the be&s;t: wherefore once more let me intreate th&eacute;e to con&s;ent to returne vnto her. Nay, aun&s;wered <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> I both defie thy intreates, and her loue, and therefore defend thy &s;elfe. Then againe hurred they together more fiercely then at the fir&s;t, but not with like aduantage, for <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> before was greatly ayded by the quicknes of his hor&s;e: and now b&eacute;eing on foote, although he were very quick and nim|ble, yet the paine which he &s;u&s;tained by his wounds were a great hinderance vnto him. On the contrary &s;ide, the Knight of the Lyons, b&eacute;eing before on the backe of a hor&s;e daily v&s;ed to trauell, was not altogether of the quicke&s;t, but now b&eacute;eing on foote, and in his chiefe prime, not hauing re|ceiued any wound, was farre more quick then his aduer&s;a|rie, by which meanes he both &s;aued him&s;elfe, and hurt his enemy euen at plea&s;ure. And at length, taking <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> at aduantage, gaue him a &s;ound blow on the &s;ide of the head, which cau&s;ed him &s;o ramble, and before hee could recouer him&s;elfe, gaue him one or two more, &s;o that hee was forced in a traunce to fall to the earth: which the Knight percei|uing, &s;tept vnto him, and before hee would giue him ayre, tooke of his gauntlet, and then finding the ring, tooke it fro~ his finger: and vnlacing his Helme, he &s;oone brought him to him&s;elfe, and perceiuing him to offer to ri&s;e, &s;aid, <HI>Adre|&s;to</HI> y&eacute;eld thy &s;elfe, and promi&s;e to for&s;ake this wicked kinde of life, and to goe into <HI>Spayne</HI> to the Dutches <HI>Lenarda,</HI> or el&s;e thou die&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Adre&s;to</HI> b&eacute;eing throughly come to him&s;elfe, and hearing the name of <HI>Lenardo,</HI> began to call to mind his former loue towards her, and in a manner cleane forgetting the Mer|chants daughter, &s;aid. Mo&s;t noble Knight, I doo not onely y&eacute;eld my &s;elfe vnto your mercy, but al&s;o willingly will doe as you commaund me, where I will y&eacute;eld mee to the noble Dutches mercy: whom I mu&s;t n&eacute;edes confe&s;&s;e, greatly to haue wronged. The Knight of the Lyons immediatly ta|king him vp from the ground, imbra&s;t him in his armes, &s;aying: that if he did as he had promi&s;ed, he &s;hould do right well, and in &s;o dooing, hee &s;hould find him for euer an a&s;&s;u|red
<PB REF="81"> friend. For which <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> gaue him infinite thankes, vowing to him the like.</P>
<P>Now by this time was the Lady <HI>Lenardas</HI> Squire come vnto them, and &s;aluting <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> demaunded how he did, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> beholding him, immediatly knewe him, and im|bracing him in his armes, demanded how his Lady fared, to whom the Squire declared, the great &s;orrow wherin &s;he had remained euer &s;ince his departure. And now hauing bound vp the wounds which he had receiued in the combat as well as they could, (for as &s;oone as the King was taken from his finger, his wounds fell on bl&eacute;eding) they returned into the Cittie, where they remained by the &s;pace of three w&eacute;ekes, for the curing of his wounds, and prouiding all things nece&s;&s;ary for their departure. Then taking leaue of the fayre Dam&s;ell whom he left with child, and the re&s;t of his acquaintance, they departed towards the Citty of <HI>Wa|terford,</HI> where they were in hope to finde the &s;hip in which the Knight of y^e Lyons had there arriued, leauing all <HI>Dub|lin</HI> &s;orry for his departure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How the Knight of the Lyons trauelling towards <HI>Waterford</HI> in the company of <HI>Adresto,</HI> was like to haue beene mur|dered, by the meanes of the Dam&s;ell of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and by what meanes he was pre&s;erued.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Knight of the Lyons, being accom|panied with <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> and his Squires, rode on &s;o farre the fir&s;t day, that they ar|riued in a &s;mall village &s;ome 15 leagues from <HI>Dublin</HI> where was onely one Ca|&s;tle, and &s;ome fewe cottages, in which Ca&s;tle there dwelt a Knight y^t was &s;ome kinne vnto the Dam&s;ell, which was &s;o intirely beloued of <HI>Adre&s;to:</HI> and h&eacute;ere the Knights minding to re&s;t them&s;elues for that night, were welcommed and entertained by the Lord of the Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Mack Gillum,</HI> with the greate&s;t
<PB REF="81"> &s;hew of kindne&s;&s;e that might be, the more &s;ecretly to con|ceale the euill which he intended in his hart, (as it is for the mo&s;t part the common v&s;e of tho&s;e Country people, which will not &s;ticke to laugh you in the face, and pre&s;ently to cut your throte:) euen &s;o dealt this Traytor, who hauing re|ce ued into his hou&s;e as ge&s;ts the&s;e two notable Knights, binding them welcome with a <HI>Iudas</HI> ki&s;&s;e, and fea&s;ting them with all the delica's that the &s;hortne&s;&s;e of the time could af|foord, yet his enueterate malice towards the Knight of the Lyons, for carrying away <HI>Don Adre&s;to</HI> from his Co&s;in, was &s;uch, that notwith&s;tanding all the former curte&s;ies which he &s;hewed him, minded in the end to rob him of his life: which he thought to bring to pa&s;&s;e in his &s;ort.</P>
<P>There was vnder one of the fayre&s;t Chambers in the Ca&s;tle, a darke and d&eacute;epe vaute, hauing no way into the &s;ame but by a trappe-doore out of the fore-&s;aid Chamber, ouer which he cau&s;ed a bed to be made for the Knight, and hauing placed two or thr&eacute;e villaines in the vaute, with charge to murder him, cau&s;ed in &s;t&eacute;ed of ropes, nothing but &s;mall &s;ticks to be layd vnder the bed, which might &s;u&s;taine the weight thereof: &s;o y^t the Knight once laying him downe theron, mu&s;t of force tumble headlong into the vaut, where the villaines b&eacute;eing ready to receiue him, &s;hould &s;oone haue ended his life: had not GOD otherwi&s;e prouided for his &s;afety, and appointed him to a farther &s;etting foorth of his glory, and thus it was. His &s;eruant <HI>Gillimo,</HI> who&s;e life he &s;aued, when as he &s;lew the re&s;t of his company, the night before hee re&s;cued <HI>Molenda,</HI> and of a thiefe entertained him to be his &s;eruaunt: h&eacute;e I &s;ay, contrary to the common v&s;e of &s;uch fellowes, who according to the old &s;aying, (Saue a thiefe from the gallowes, and he will be the fir&s;t that will cut thy throte) hauing an e&s;peciall loue and care vnto his Mai&s;ter, as thinking that time ill &s;pent, which was not to his profit or content, &amp; that in dooing the &s;ame hee did God good &s;eruice, was alwayes very carefull and diligent about him, e&s;pecially, where hee did any way &s;u&s;pect euill to be meant towards him: but now more the~ at any other time,
<PB REF="82"> knowing the wickednes of <HI>Mack Gillum,</HI> hee li&s;tned and prided about, to &s;&eacute;e if hee could perceaue them whi&s;per a|mong&s;t them&s;elues. A little after &s;upper, comming &s;udden|ly into a darke entry, he heard &s;ome talking, and li&s;tning a while vnto them: one of them &s;ayd: Well, &amp; my Mai&s;ter and they aboue, doe their part kindly, in cau&s;ing the bed to fall, this dagger &s;hall pierce his hart, farre &s;ooner then <HI>Adre&s;tos</HI> &s;word could pierce his Armor. Nay replyed ano|ther, I will &s;urely giue him the fir&s;t wound, for robbing <HI>Valeria</HI> of her Louer. <HI>Gillimo</HI> hearing this knew pre&s;ent|ly that it was his Mai&s;ter whom they ment, wherefore dil|ligently noting the place, he returned &s;afely into the roome where he left his Mai&s;ter, and finding them ready to goe to their Chamber, hee could not conueniently make it knowne.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Mack Gillum</HI> hauing called for lights, willed his wife and two of his daughters, to accompany <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> vn|to his chamber, and hee him&s;elfe would accompany the Knight of the Lions vnto his (where hee hoped ere long to be &s;ufficiently reuenged, for the wrong which hee had done vnto his Co&s;in.) Thus hauing brought him to his chamber, he continued di&s;cour&s;ing of many matters, vn|till he was almo&s;t vnready, then bidding him good night, he went towards the doore to haue gone foorth, and com|ming &s;omewhat neare the bed: on a &s;udden <HI>Gillimo</HI> &s;tept vnto him, and before he was ware thereof, tooke him in his armes, and by cleane force threw him into the mid&s;t of the bed: from whence immediatly the &s;tickes breaking, h&eacute;e tumbled headlong into the Vaut, where he was pre&s;ently &s;labde to death by the villaines, which he had prepared to haue kilde the Knight of the Lions: &s;o that the &s;aying of the Scripture in him was rightly fulfilled, he hath layd a &s;nare for another, and him&s;elfe is falne into the mi&s;chiefe there|of.</P>
<P>The Knight of the Lions, &amp; the re&s;t of them that were in the chamber, at the fir&s;t were greatly a&s;tonied h&eacute;ereat: but &s;&eacute;eing the &s;equell, and con&s;idering that it was deui&s;ed
<PB REF="82"> of purpo&s;e for to haue murdered him, fell on their kn&eacute;es, and gaue thankes vnto almighty God, who had deliuered him, out of this iminent danger of death.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. How the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> King &s;ent ouer into <HI>Denmarke,</HI> vnder the conduct of his Co&s;in the Earle of <HI>Dougla&s;&s;e,</HI> tenne thou|&s;and Souldiers, and how the Arch-Bi&s;hop and the o|ther Traytors, ioyned their forces with him.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu may remember how in the former part of this Hi&s;tory, that the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> and others of the chiefe &s;tates of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> di&s;liking the gouernment, whereof them&s;elues were in a manner the chiefe and fir&s;t beginners, had practi&s;ed with the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> King, for the &s;ending ouer forces, promi&s;ing to deliuer the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke</HI> into his hands, and farther, to that end had deliuered pledges for &s;ure perfor|mance thereof.</P>
<P>Now therefore the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> hauing mu&s;tred vp his forces, made choi&s;e of tenne thou&s;and of his approoued and be&s;t men of Armes, and hauing fitted them of all things n&eacute;edfull for that warre, gaue them in charge vnto his kin&s;|man the Earle of <HI>Dougla&s;&s;e:</HI> a man for his vallour and courage highly to bee commended, and for his wi&s;dome and pollicie, to bee compared with mo&s;t in Chri&s;tendome: as hauing great experience, e&s;pecially in matters of affaires, wherein he had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time, being now about the age of forty eight or fifty yeares: vn|to him did the King deliuer this Armie, with fr&eacute;e commi&s;&s;i|on to di&s;po&s;e thereof, &amp; of the whole affaires of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> With this Armie he departed towards the Sea-coa&s;t, ac|companied with many braue and hardy Knights who vol|lentary went to beare him company, with hope in the&s;e warres to gaine &s;ame by their vallour: and being come to the towne of <HI>Helfue,</HI> they tooke &s;hipping, and the winde &s;eruing the~, they directed their cour&s;e towards <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hauing before hand &s;ent intelligence of their comming, vn|to the traytors to their Country, their confedrats, who like|wi&s;e
<PB REF="83"> vpon this newes, v&s;ed all the dilligence they could, for the leauying of their forces to ioyne with the forren power: cau&s;ing Libels, and other meanes to be wrote, to &s;educe others likewi&s;e from their loyaltie towards their Gouer|nors and Country, and to fall into the &s;ame trea&s;on with them. Of which &s;ort there were a great many, who for di|uers cau&s;es were &s;oone drawne into the &s;ame, e&s;pecially &s;uch as by any meanes had offended the lawes, and feared the penaltie thereof: which by the Gouernors was &s;euere|ly executed.</P>
<P>Who now vpon this rumor and hurliburly, were not a little troubled, and perceauing &s;uch great men to be actors h&eacute;erein, feared a generall reuolt, wherefore drawing them&s;elues together into coun&s;ell, they deui&s;ed all the meanes they could, to preuent the &s;ame: and hauing &s;ent vnto the Arch Bi&s;hop and his complices, by faire meanes to haue cau&s;ed them to lay downe their weapons, and not like madmen as it were to rip their owne bowels, which they mu&s;t n&eacute;edes doe in &s;tirring vp this ciuill contention, which is the greate&s;t enemie that po&s;&s;ible may happen to any common-wealth, and that in calling in forren powers, was not only to bring into bondage their Country, and natiue &s;oyle, but al&s;o them&s;elues and their whole po&s;teri|tie: for what Conquerer is there, that hauing brought into &s;ubiection any Kingdome or Prouince, will not cau&s;e his owne lawes &amp; cu&s;tomes to be imbraced by the vanqui&s;hed, which he cannot well doe, except fir&s;t he not only roote out tho&s;e, whom he thinkes may be any way a hindrance vnto his proc&eacute;edings, then likewi&s;e mu&s;t hee place as Gouer|nors and Rulers ouer his people, &s;uch as he &s;hall thinke readie&s;t to obey and fulfill his commaundements, which can be no other but of his owne natiue Country: and then how grieuous it will bee vnto you to be commaunded by &s;trangers, doe but con&s;ider. But peraduenture you will &s;ay, that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> hath promi&s;ed, not only to con|tinue you in your former e&s;tates, but al&s;o preferre you to higher dignities, and you will relie vppon his royall pro|mi&s;e.
<PB REF="84"> Con&s;ider wee be&s;&eacute;ech you, how that he, nor no man liuing what&s;oeuer he be hath any terme or a&s;&s;urance of his life in this world, and that though hee k&eacute;epe his promi&s;e with you, yet your felicity is of no longer a&s;&s;urance then his life: but &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould liue a long time, knowe you not, that he that by ambition gaineth a Crowne, no &s;ooner commeth to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions thereof, but he pre&s;ently cutteth downe the prope, by which him&s;elfe did clime thereunto, fearing by the &s;ame likewi&s;e to fall as he did ri&s;e.</P>
<P>This, or the like exhortation, the Gouernors at the fir&s;t v&s;ed towards the rebellious Traytors, which could no|thing at all mooue them to giue ouer theyr pretended trea|chery: and then &s;&eacute;eing there was no way, but by force to with&s;tand their fury, knowing al&s;o that the Scotti&s;h forces were on the coa&s;t, and daily expected to land, they tooke order forth-with for the leauying of forces, placing new and great &s;upplies in their garri&s;on Townes, furni&s;hing them both with munition and vittailes, as well as the &s;hortnes of the time would permit them. And now hauing gathe|red togethers thirty thou&s;and &s;ouldiers, the greate&s;t part whereof were men taken from the Plow and Cart, fitter with the &s;harpe Colter to teare vp the ground, then with &s;word and &s;peare to incounter with the enemy in the fielde, and their Leaders mo&s;t of them as vn&s;kilful as theyr &s;oldi|ers, knowing how better to daunce a galliard or a Pauine in a Ladies Chamber, then to mar&s;hall a band of men rea|die to incounter theyr enemies: &s;o much had the lacke of v&s;e of Armes, &s;ince the lo&s;&s;e of theyr King, altered that flo|ri&s;hing kingdom, which in former time did greatly abound with many &s;tout &amp; hardy Knights, a great number where|of were either dead or lo&s;t in the &s;earch of their King. The one halfe of which Armie b&eacute;eing giuen in charge vnto the Lords of <HI>Opencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen,</HI> marched towards the Arch|bi&s;hop and his confederates, who with the number of 12 or 14. thou&s;and &s;ouldiers, being on the other &s;ide the riuer of <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> began to &s;poyle and &s;ack the Country, putting to &s;word, all tho&s;e that made any re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t them, and
<PB REF="84"> hauing taken <HI>Cargue</HI> and <HI>Londen,</HI> two Townes of great &s;trength, placed therein garri&s;ons, then marching towards <HI>Opencade,</HI> they heard of the comming of the Lords of <HI>O|pencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen,</HI> and fearing to be taken at aduantage, they altered theyr cour&s;e towards <HI>Rensborge,</HI> where the Earle <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e</HI> with his forces was landed, hoping to ioyne with him: which the Lords of <HI>Opencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen</HI> vnder&s;tanding, pur&s;ued him &s;o eagerly, that b&eacute;eing come within &s;ight almo&s;t of the Scots, they &s;et vpon their rere|ward, putting a great number of them to the &s;word: and euen at the &s;ame in&s;tant, was the other Army, which which was ledde by the Lord <HI>It&s;enho,</HI> and the County of <HI>Mildrop,</HI> likewi&s;e come in &s;ight, which cau&s;ed a great feare in the harts of the Traytors, &s;o that had it not b&eacute;ene for a company of two thou&s;and Scots, which came to their re|&s;cue vnder the conduct of Sir <HI>Iames Lewrence,</HI> Co&s;in ger|man vnto the Earle, they had b&eacute;en all eyther &s;laine, or put to flight: but the comming of this &s;uccor, &s;o animated theyr almo&s;t fainting courages, that, where before they were in a manner ready to turne theyr backes, they now began to recouer theyr ground that they had lo&s;t, the fight growing very hote and bloody on both &s;ides, there b&eacute;eing &s;laine of the States aboue a thou&s;and &s;ouldiers, and of the Rebels 800.</P>
<P>Longer had the fight continued, but that the Lord <HI>Har|ding,</HI> and the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> fearing the comming of the other power, which was hard at hand, cau&s;ed the retraite to be &s;ounded, and &s;o with an ea&s;ie pace marched to the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Campe, not minding if they could chu&s;e, to fight in two or thr&eacute;e daies, becau&s;e of the wearines of his &s;ouldiers, who comming newly from Sea, were many of them di|&s;tempered.

<PB REF="86"> began to flie as fa&s;t as their hor&s;es could carry them. One of the Knights that was with the Qu&eacute;ene, b&eacute;eing more har|die then his fellowes, &s;tayd to make re&s;i&s;tance whil&s;t the o|thers e&s;caped: but alas, &s;mall was the defence which hee could make being vnarmed, again&s;t &s;o mighty a foe, who&s;e huge Armour he was not able to pierce, although thereon he brake his Bore&s;peare which he had in his hand all to &s;hi|uers: and drawing out his &s;word to try if that would doe any better, before hee could deliuer any &s;troke there with, was him&s;elfe clouen to the middle. And leauing him there, the Giant per&s;ued the others, which by this time had gained a great way before him: and comming into a rough &s;tony way, the hor&s;e wheron y^e Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Oliua</HI> rode &s;tum|bled and fell to y^e ground, not b&eacute;eing able to recouer againe. Which &s;he perceiuing, beganne to flie on foote, whereby in &s;hort &s;pace, the Gyant had gained a great deale of ground of her, &s;o that within le&s;&s;e then a quarter of a mile h&eacute;e mu&s;t n&eacute;eds haue ouertaken her, had not the Knight of Fortune, (b&eacute;eing as is afore&s;aid, riding towards the Citty <HI>Towers</HI>) hapned to arriue: who at the fir&s;t &s;&eacute;eing a farre of one run|ning &s;o fa&s;t, was pre&s;ently touched with the remembrance of his former vi&s;ion: and calling to his Squire, put on his Helmet, and taking his Launce in his hand, rode towards them, when pre&s;ently the Lady (b&eacute;eing cleane wearied and out of breath) ca&s;t her&s;elfe downe before him, not b&eacute;eing a|ble to &s;peake a word.</P>
<P>The Knight viewing her &s;inguler beauty, knew pre|&s;ently that it was the &s;ame Lady who~ in his fancie hee had vowed to &s;erue: wherefore incouraging him&s;elfe, thinking that now was the time, if euer, to &s;hew him&s;elfe valerous, b&eacute;eing in her pre&s;ence, and in her cau&s;e, for who&s;e &s;ake h&eacute;e could indure a thou&s;and deaths, &s;pake vnto her in this ma|ner. Mo&s;t beautifull Lady, comfort your &s;elfe, and feare not this huge lump of fle&s;h which hath pur&s;ued you, for I doubt not, but God will &s;o &s;trengthen mine arme, as I &s;hall &s;oone be able to make him confe&s;&s;e his folly, in going about to wrong &s;o heauenly a creature. Then &s;etting &s;purres to his
<PB REF="86"> hor&s;e, he ranne again&s;t the Giant, who by this time was come almo&s;t vnto them, and hitting him full in the mid&s;t of the ma&s;&s;y &s;hield which he wore, hanging by a &s;tirrup about his necke, gaue him &s;uch a blow, that piercing the &s;ame, he cau&s;ed him to ramble backwards, b&eacute;eing hardly able to &s;tand vpon his legges, breaking his Launce all to peeces. Thus hauing ended his cour&s;e, he turned about, and fea|ring that in fighting on hor&s;ebacke, hee might be in great danger if the Giant &s;hould kill his hor&s;e, hee allighted, and dre&s;&s;ing his Shield on his arme, hee drew foorth his &s;word, going boldly to m&eacute;ete his huge enemie: who hauing reco|uered him&s;elfe of the incounter, likewi&s;e went towards the Knight, with a mighty Semiter in his hand, thinking at the fir&s;t blow to haue cleft him in two. But he being wary, ea&s;ily auoided the &s;ame, by &s;hifting his body a&s;ide, the Gi|ant hauing mi&s;t his blow, was not able to recouer his Se|miter &s;o lightly, (which was entred almo&s;t a foote into the ground) but that the Knight taking the aduantage there|of, gaue him a &s;ore blow on the left arme, almo&s;t at the &s;houlder, which piercing his thicke Armour cut him to the bone, the griefe whereof was &s;uch, that hee could not after|wards rule his ma&s;&s;y targe &s;o well as otherwi&s;e he would, by which meanes he had great aduantage: for now the Gi|ant b&eacute;eing forced to lay on, and onely to tru&s;t to his &s;word both for offence and defence, many times receiued wound vpon wound: &s;ometimes likewi&s;e fa&s;tning blowes on his aduer&s;ary, hee would cau&s;e him to bend his kn&eacute;es to the ground, renting his Armor where he touched, and cau&s;ing the blood to i&s;&s;ue out thereof in many places. Thus conti|nued they a long time, the aduantage, if there were any, remaining with the Knight of Fortune.</P>
<P>By this time had the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Oliua</HI> recouered her&s;elfe againe, and although &s;h&eacute;e &s;aw the Knight to haue the better &s;ide, yet the feare which &s;he had was &s;uch, that &s;hee would haue fled away &s;he wi&s;t not whether, had it not b&eacute;en for the Knights Squire, who comming vnto her, per&s;waded her with many arguments to &s;tay and &s;&eacute;e the end, which hee
<PB REF="87"> was certaine could not be without the death of the Gyant, for that his Lord did continually increa&s;e vpon him, and who&s;e vallour he knew to be &s;uch, that the longer hee con|tinued, the more increa&s;ed his courage: but put ca&s;e the Giant &s;hould haue the victory, yet would it of force be with &s;uch danger to him&s;elfe, that they n&eacute;eded not to feare his pur&s;ute. The Prince&s;&s;e being &s;omething h&eacute;erewith com|forted, was contented to &s;tay the end, yet not beeing fully re&s;olued of feare, &s;he intreated the Squire to helpe mount her on his Mai&s;ters hor&s;e, which he did, then &s;itting to be|hold the combat, &s;he que&s;tioned with him of many matters touching his Mai&s;ter, whom in her hart &s;hee greatly com|mended, demaunding what and of whence hee was. To which his Squire replied, that hee was di&s;cended of noble blood, but for his name and Country, he might not di&s;clo&s;e to any one, being commaunded to the contrary, only this, he called him&s;elfe the Knight of Fortune. Then declaring vnto her his fir&s;t combat at Sea, and the battaile with <HI>Signior Roberto,</HI> when hee deliuered the Lady <HI>Beleriza:</HI> where hearing of the &s;trange reports of the inchaunted Ca&s;tle, he determined to make triall thereof, not forget|ting to declare vnto her his Mai&s;ters Vi&s;ion at Sea, which more then all the re&s;t did cau&s;e her to admire, thinking with her &s;elfe that it was only by the worke of God: then con&s;idering what it was to bee loued by &s;uch a Knight, who&s;e equall &s;he neuer had before &s;&eacute;ene, beganne d&eacute;eply to fancie him. Thus pa&s;t they away the time, whiles the two fierce Champions continued their combat, both giuing and receauing many wounds, all the ground b&eacute;e|ing &s;tayned with their blood: and now the Giant being al|together inraged, rebelling and cur&s;ing his fal&s;e Gods, foming at the mouth like a mad man, ranne vppon the Knight, thinking to haue taken him in his armes, but h&eacute;e perceauing his intent, and lothing &s;uch imbracements, preuented him by auoyding through the quickne&s;&s;e of his body, deliuering withall &s;o &s;ound a blowe on his right arme, which he had &s;tretched foorth, that he cau&s;ed both it
<PB REF="87"> and his heauie Semiter to fly into the field, then per&s;uing his victory, he neuer left wounding of him, till &s;uch time as he cau&s;ed him to fall dead to the ground.</P>
<P>And then parting his head from his &s;houlders, he kn&eacute;e|led downe on his kn&eacute;es, rending thankes to God for the victory: and taking vp the head, hee went and pre&s;ented the &s;ame to the Prince&s;&s;e, de&s;iring her to accept the &s;ame, as the fir&s;t &s;howe of his loue, who had vowed him&s;elfe wholy to her &s;eruice. The Prince&s;&s;e dying her ch&eacute;ekes with a modde&s;t blu&s;h, giuing him harty thankes for pre&s;er|uing her life, &s;he intreated him to conduct her to the Cit|ty, where &s;he would cau&s;e him to be honored according to his de&s;ert. The Knight ea&s;ily con&s;ented h&eacute;ereto, and ha|uing bound vp this wounds, cau&s;ed his Squire to place her behind him, in this &s;ort rode they onwards, the Knight declaring vnto her his loue, which he had vowed long be|fore he had &s;&eacute;ene her, only by his vi&s;ion which he had &s;&eacute;ene, when fir&s;t he left his owne Country. Whil&s;t they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing of loue, they perceaued a great troope of Knights, comming galloping towards them, which when they were come n&eacute;ere vnto them, the Prince&s;&s;e knewe them to be the Qu&eacute;enes Knights: who being gathered to|gether, and finding her wanting, were &s;ent to pur&s;ue the Giant, and now hauing found her &s;o well re&s;cued, they were not a little glad thereof: meruailing greatly how &s;he had e&s;caped. And demaunding of her, were giuen to vn|der&s;tand, the whole di&s;cour&s;e before recited, wherein &s;hee did not faile to extoll the Knights vallor to the vttermo&s;t: but hee attributed his victory more to her beauty then his owne vallour. Thus rode they on till they came to the Cit|ty, one of the Knights carrying the Giants head, to y^e great wonder of the whole Citty, who highly commended &s;o vallerous a d&eacute;ede. And comming to the Court, they were receaued with great ioy by the Qu&eacute;ene, and the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia.</HI> who a&s;&s;uredly e&s;t&eacute;emed her lo&s;t: but when they vn|der&s;tood the manner how &s;hee was deliuered, they gaue God harty thankes, greatly honoring and commending
<PB REF="88"> the Knight of fortune, fea&s;ting and intertaining him with all the kindne&s;&s;e that might be, and being lodged in the Pallace, was euery day during the cure of his wounds, vi&s;ited by the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia</HI> and her daughter, vnto whom many times hee declared his pa&s;&s;ions: which the Prince&s;&s;e perceauing to be extreame, beganne &s;omething to pitty him, which <HI>Cupid</HI> perceauing, and minding to &s;howe his diuine power, wounded her to the hart with one of his impoy&s;oned &s;hafts, whereby &s;hee could neuer b&eacute;e in quiet but in his pre&s;ence: which hee perceauing, beganne farre &s;ooner then otherwi&s;e he could haue done, to recouer his &s;trength, &s;o that within fift&eacute;ene daies he was throughly whole, and being able to beare Armor againe, determined to trauel towards y^e inchaunted Ca&s;tle, but fir&s;t he thought good once more to try the Prince&s;&s;e, as you &s;hall heare in the Chapter following.</P>

<P>_THE Knight of Fortune, b&eacute;eing throughly healed of his wounds which he had receiued in fighting with the Giant <HI>Latron,</HI> when as he deliuered the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Oliua,</HI> and mind|ing to make triall of the aduenture of the in|chaunted Ca&s;tle, one day finding the Prince&s;&s;e &s;ollitarie, walking in the Pallace garden, came vnto her, and after &s;alutations pa&s;t betw&eacute;ene them, began as followeth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t excellent &amp; beautious Prince&s;&s;e, if the cruell paines of a faithfull Louer, may any way mooue compa&s;&s;ion in a Ladies hart, or the endle&s;&s;e &s;ighes and teares of a Knight wounded by <HI>Cupids</HI> &s;hafts, may de&s;erue to be pittied, then I be&s;eech you Madam to behold him, that not onely langui|&s;heth, but is euen ready, through the extreame pa&s;&s;ions
<PB REF="88"> which I f&eacute;ele, to &s;uffer death for your loue, b&eacute;eing appoin|ted by the De&s;tinies to loue you, before euer I had &s;ight of this your heauenly and diuine beauty, &s;ince which time it hath &s;o increa&s;ed in me, that I finde no other remedy if you prooue cruell, but death onely: which if you &s;hould, would be to me mo&s;t welcome.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;&s;e hearing this, which vnto her was mo&s;t plea&s;ant, an&s;wered, Knight of Fortune, what other name to call you by I am vtterly ignorant of, the loue which you &s;ay you beare vnto me, may be great, neither doo I thinke the contrary, as the hazarding of your &s;elfe to &s;aue my life, I mu&s;t n&eacute;edes confe&s;&s;e de&s;erues y^e greate&s;t recompence that I can be&s;tow on you. But how farre vnfitting it is for one of my e&s;tate, to place my affection on a &s;tranger, who&s;e name nor Country I know not, yea peraduenture on &s;uch a one, who though now he &s;eemes to loue, yet hauing gay|ned what he &s;&eacute;ekes for, may as &s;oone leaue me: but put ca&s;e I were &s;o fondly bent, as not looking before I leapt, &s;hould place my affection on you, doo you thinke, that eyther the King my Grandfather, or y^e re&s;t of my friends would giue con&s;ent to my choi&s;e, &s;urely I am per&s;waded they would neuer y&eacute;eld thereto.</P>
<P>The Knight hauing attentiuely li&s;tned to her di&s;cour&s;e, and withall noting her change of culler whil&s;t that &s;he was &s;peaking, e&s;pecially when &s;h&eacute;e &s;&eacute;emed to make doubt of his con&s;tancie, replyed. Worthy Prince&s;&s;e, who&s;e beautie ex|celleth the mo&s;t fayre&s;t, and who&s;e wi&s;edome excelleth that beautie, my name, which vnto none &s;ince I left my owne Country I haue declared, is <HI>Iago,</HI> my natiue &s;oile the Dut|chie of <HI>Saxony</HI> where my aged Father gouerns, not know|ing what is become of me his vnhappy &s;onne, who for the de&s;ire of &s;&eacute;eking &s;trange aduentures, &s;tale &s;ecretly out of his Court, what &s;ince hath befalne me, I thinke partly by my &s;elfe, and my Squire you haue already heard. But where you &s;&eacute;eme to doubt of my loyaltie, I be&s;&eacute;ech God no longer to permit my life, then vnto you I proue faithfull: &amp; where|as you likewi&s;e doubt your friends con&s;ents, thinke not but
<PB REF="89"> both your Grandfather, yea and the Prince your Father likewi&s;e, who I doubt not ere long to &s;&eacute;e at libertie, wil ea|&s;ily giue their con&s;ents, &s;&eacute;eing you de&s;irous to accord there|to. The Prince&s;&s;e no longer able to conceale y^e loue which &s;he bare him, and knowing him to be the Prince of <HI>Saxo|nie,</HI> who&s;e forwardne&s;&s;e long before by fame had b&eacute;en bru|ted in the <HI>French</HI> Court, together with that of his &s;uppo&s;ed Brother, the Gentleman of the Forre&s;t, demaunded whe|ther it were him&s;elfe or his Brother, that had atchieued the aduenture of the inchaunted Sword. The Knight an&s;we|red that it was his &s;uppo&s;ed brother, who&s;e ab&s;ence was the chiefe&s;t cau&s;e of his trauell. And herewithall hee decla|red vnto her, the &s;trange finding of <HI>Euordanus,</HI> together with the great loue and affection betweene them, as is be|fore declared: at which di&s;cour&s;e the Prince&s;&s;e tooke great delight, and in the end, hauing fully re&s;olued with her&s;elfe, &s;he was contented to take him for her hu&s;band. And ha|uing thus vowed each to other fayth and loyaltie, hee tooke his leaue of her with many a cha&s;t ki&s;&s;e: the next day pre|paring him&s;elfe to trauell towards the inchaunted Ca&s;tle, where within &s;ixe dayes after hee arriued, rea&s;onable be|times in the morning. And b&eacute;eing come euen to the Bridge foote, hee was willed by a Squire to pa&s;&s;e no further, then pre&s;ently came foorth the Giant <HI>Brandofell,</HI> mounted on a mightie Cour&s;er, bearing in his hand a Lance big enough to haue b&eacute;en the Ma&s;t of a &s;mall &s;hyppe. Which when the Knight of Fortune beheld, hee greatly admired the &s;ame, yet not b&eacute;eing any thing afraid, he &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, addre&s;&s;ing his &s;hield, and placing his Launce in his re&s;t, which he directed right again&s;t the Giants brea&s;t, who by rea&s;on of his huge &s;tature, bare his Launce &s;o hie, that co~|ming together, he ranne the &s;ame cleane ouer his head, not &s;o much as once touching him therewith: but the Knights Launce hitting in the mid&s;t of the Giants &s;hielde, brake in|to a thou&s;and &s;hiuers, cau&s;ing the huge tower to bend back|wards, but yet k&eacute;eping his &s;addle, they met together &s;o fu|riou&s;ly with their bodies, that they were both hor&s;e &amp; men
<PB REF="89"> tumbled to the ground, (to the great meruaile of the prince <HI>Don Edward</HI> and the other Knights, which were &s;tanding on the battlements of the Ca&s;tle beholding the &s;ame, who greatly commended him in their harts,) then quickly re|couering them&s;elues, they drew foorth theyr &s;words, and comming together, they began a mo&s;t cruell and dangerous combat: the Knight &s;till fearing his mighty blowes, did of|ten voyde the &s;ame by the quickne&s;&s;e of his bodie: but yet many times receiued wound vppon wound, him&s;elfe like|wi&s;e giuing many.</P>
<P>Thus continued they the &s;pare of two howres without any great aduantage to be di&s;cerned betw&eacute;ene them: the Giant at length beginning to be out of breath, beganne to giue back a little, which the Knight perceiuing folowed him the fa&s;ter, and the Giant &s;till giuing back, hapned to &s;tum|ble on a p&eacute;ece of the Knights Launce, wherewith he fell to the ground: &s;o that before he could recouer him&s;elfe, he had receiued two great wounds, the one in his thigh, the other in his right arme, whereby (b&eacute;eing againe gotten on his f&eacute;ete) he could not &s;o well handle his Semiter as before h&eacute;e did, which was &s;oone the occa&s;ion that the Knight of For|tune got the victorie, yet very d&eacute;erly, for hauing the Giant at this aduantage, he determined to end the Combat quick|ly, and croching neere, the better to giue a full blow at his head, he performed the &s;ame with &s;uch force, that h&eacute;e cau&s;ed him to tumble to the ground, receiuing withall &s;o mightie a blow from the Giant on the right &s;ide, that cleauing his &s;hield in two, he was thereby &s;ore wounded in the &s;houlder and in his arme.</P>
<P>But euen as he was going to be reuenged thereof, by cutting of his head, the Gyant <HI>Furoll</HI> came vnto him, and by force taking him in his armes, doe what he could, he carried him into the Ca&s;tle, where being di&s;armed, he had his wounds very carefully looked vnto, at the intreaty of the Prince, who greatly liked him for his vallour, which he had &s;howed in the combat with <HI>Brandofell.</HI> And beeing cured of his wounds, was alwaies by the Prince held as

All which was a great increa&s;e of the loue and amity b&eacute;e|tweene them, whereby they pa&s;&s;ed away the time of their impri&s;onment with y^e greater content, which was not now very long: for God pittying the lo&s;&s;e of &s;o many braue and hardy Knights, &s;ent not long after the impri&s;onment of the Knight of Fortune, the Knight of the Lions, and <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> as you &s;hall heare h&eacute;ereafter.

<P>_I Haue a long time forgotten to declare vnto you, the great &s;orrowe and griefe, which the noble Duke <HI>Mauris,</HI> the Dutches, and all the re&s;t of the Court &s;u&s;tained, when the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> was found mi&s;&s;ing, which was the next day after his departure: for the Duke his fa|ther finding him wanting the next day, demaunded where he was, as being giuen to vnder&s;ta~d y^t his Squire <HI>Stepha|no,</HI> only in his companie departed towards the Sea &s;ide, &amp; that &s;ince they were not returned. Wherefore the Duke cau&s;ed inquiry to be made for him, and hearing no certaine newes thereby, hee grew meruailous di&s;contented there|with: and comming into the Dutches her chamber, h&eacute;e found both her and her daughter in as great perplexity, not knowing what to coniecture of his ab&s;ence, and de|maunding whether they knewe the cau&s;e thereof, the Dutches told him that &s;ince the departure of the Gentle|man

<P>The Duke hauing red this Letter, and now by the con|tents thereof knowing certainly what was become of his &s;onne, was &s;omewhat appea&s;ed of his griefe, and departing into his Clo&s;et, with more adui&s;edne&s;&s;e to con&s;ider of the contents thereof, began with rea&s;on to debate his &s;orrow, and hauing throughly wayed each matter with him&s;elfe, he could not choo&s;e but in his hart highly commend the noble minde of his &s;onne, whom hee did not doubt but in time would prooue a famous Prince. Thus by little &amp; little the
<PB REF="91"> old Duke recomforted him&s;elfe, but the Dutches, and her daughter the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> could not &s;o &s;oone &s;hake of their &s;orrow, e&s;pecially the Prince&s;&s;e, who now b&eacute;eing de|&s;titute of her Brothers company, and al&s;o wanting y^e &s;ight of her Louer, who&s;e very ab&s;ence was a hell vnto her, and who&s;e returne &s;he feared would be very long, by rea&s;on of his vow at his departure: which was not to re&s;t in any place, vntill hee had found out his Parents. Many times would &s;he debate with her&s;elfe heereof, &s;omewhiles imagi|ning, that hee trauailing through &s;o many &s;trange Coun|tries, might peraduenture be wonne to the loue of &s;ome more beautifull Dame: then would &s;he run &s;traight waies to behold her&s;elfe in her gla&s;&s;e, and with the minds of ma|ny women, thinking her&s;elfe exc&eacute;eding fayre, &s;he would be|gin to blame him of incon&s;tancie: then &s;uddenly reproouing her&s;elfe for condemning him without true knowledge, &s;h&eacute;e would &s;ay, Ah <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> vnfortunate wench, how can&s;t thou conceiue &s;o ill a thought again&s;t him whom thou &s;o d&eacute;erely loue&s;t: O that it were lawfull for mee like a man to goe to &s;&eacute;eke th&eacute;e out, whereby to manife&s;t the loue I beare thee, but alas I cannot, wherfore I will only direct my prayers vnto almighty GOD to pre&s;erue th&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Thus would &s;h&eacute;e many times vnder cullour of lamen|ting her Brothers ab&s;ence, bewaile her friend, which toge|ther with the griefe of the Dutches her mother, cau&s;ed the whole Court to remaine a long time in heauines, giuing o|uer all their former pa&s;times &amp; exerci&s;es of plea&s;ure, where|in the Court did very much abound.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. How the Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adresto,</HI> &s;hipping them &s;elues for <HI>Spayne,</HI> were by force of weather driuen on the coa&s;t of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> where going on &s;hore they heard of the <HI>Inchanted Castell,</HI> and how comming thether, the Knight of the Lyons ended the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> hauing remained a long time at <HI>Water|ford,</HI> &s;taying for a winde to &s;aile towards <HI>Spaine,</HI> whether the Knight of the Lyons determined to accompany <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> to &s;&eacute;e if hee could by y^e wi&s;e <HI>Adriano,</HI> learne any thing touching his parents, whom he as yet knew not: and now hauing remained by the &s;pace of eight w&eacute;ekes idlely in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Marriners brought them newes of a North-ea&s;t winde, wherefore making ha&s;t, b&eacute;e|ing furni&s;hed with all things n&eacute;edfull for their voyage, they went aboord: and hauing hoi&s;ed there &s;ailes, they commit|ted them&s;elues to the mercy of the Seas, and the winde blowing a rea&s;onable good gale, they &s;oone had lo&s;t y^e &s;ight of the Iri&s;h land. The next day by noone, the Mai&s;ter of the &s;hippe, told them that they had gone very fa&s;t, for by &s;oun|ding he knew him&s;elfe to be within fiue leages of an Iland now called <HI>Sillie:</HI> wherefore directing their cour&s;e &s;ome|what to the Southward, they &s;ailed on merrily by the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e daies, but on the fourth day the winde altring and much increa&s;ing his force, cau&s;ed them after much &s;triuing to put them&s;elues with the land, which they found to be a port in <HI>Fraunce</HI> called <HI>Roke&s;tay.</HI> Where comming on &s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elues, they were giuen to vnder&s;tand of the aduenture of the Inchaunted Ca&s;tle, wherein &s;o ma|ny braue and hardy Knigts had lo&s;t them&s;elues. Which when the Knight of the Lions heard, and being very de&s;i|rous to prooue the &s;ame, he intreated <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> to accompa|nie him thether, who being as de&s;irous as him&s;elfe to win
<PB REF="92"> honor, ea&s;ily con&s;ented: vppon condition that him&s;elfe might haue the fir&s;t triall of the aduenture. And being h&eacute;ere|on concluded, they directed their cour&s;e towards the For|re&s;t, where within tenne daies after they arriued, and b&eacute;e|ing at length come to the Ca&s;tle, in the morning &s;ome|what early, hauing re&s;ted them&s;elues the night before in a Village on the edge of the Forre&s;t: where they were giuen to vnder&s;tand, of the great vallour of the Knight of For|tune, who &s;ome fift&eacute;ene daies before was taken pri&s;oner, who&s;e lo&s;&s;e was greatly bewailed in y^e <HI>French</HI> Court: the Knights being as I haue &s;ayd come vnto the Ca&s;tle, had not long &s;tayed, before &s;uch time as <HI>Brando&s;ell</HI> beeing throughly cured of his wounds, which hee had receaued of the Knight of Fortune, came foorth mounted on his won|ted Cour&s;er, at who&s;e hugene&s;&s;e both y^e Knights did great|ly wonder, yet not being any whit di&s;maide, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> accor|ding to their agr&eacute;ement, tooke the other part of the field a|gain&s;t him, and &s;etting &s;purres to their hor&s;es, they met together with &s;uch fury, that breaking their Launces to p&eacute;eces, they pa&s;&s;ed on halfe a&s;tonied: &amp; hauing ended their cour&s;e, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> turning his hor&s;e drew foorth his &s;word: but the Gyant who neuer before had fought on hor&s;e-back, was going to alight, which <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> perceauing, called vn|to him, telling him it was not the part of a Knight to for|&s;ake his hor&s;e, as long as he was able to k&eacute;epe him on his backe. Which the Gyant hearing, and thinking with him|&s;elfe, that if fighting on hor&s;e-backe, hee &s;hould find any di&s;aduantage, hee might ea&s;ily &s;ley his enemies hor&s;e, it cau&s;ed him drawing his heauy Semiter to v&s;e the&s;e &s;p&eacute;eches. Knight, I was willing to haue delayed thy death for a while, which on foote might haue b&eacute;ene deferred by thy quickne&s;&s;e: but now &s;&eacute;eing it is thy own doings to fight on hor&s;e-backe, blame none but thy &s;elfe for thy folly. Then comming both together, the Gyant had thought to haue deliuered a blow vpon his &s;hield, but <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> being very wary auoyded the &s;ame by the quicke &s;hifting of his hor&s;e, giuing the Gyant a mighty blow on the right &s;ide, which
<PB REF="93"> he taking with his &s;hield, &s;lyced away a great part thereof. Which the Giant perceiuing, wondred at his &s;trength, &s;o likewi&s;e did Prince <HI>Edward, Don Iago,</HI> and many other hardy Knights, who &s;toode on the battlement of the Ca&s;tle to behold the combat, greatly commending the braue ma|naging of <HI>Adre&s;to.</HI></P>
<P>But Prince <HI>Edward</HI> ca&s;ting his eye on the Knight of the Lyons, who was &s;till &s;itting on hor&s;ebacke, began to haue a meruailous opinion of him, &s;o y^e turning to <HI>Iago</HI> hee &s;aid: that if his mind did not mi&s;d&eacute;eme, that Knight on hor&s;eback was the better of the two, and that if they did both fayle in this attempt, it was in vaine for them euer to expect deliue|rance. Now had <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> and the Giant, continued theyr battell by the &s;pace of halfe an howre on hor&s;ebacke, both of them hauing receiued many wounds, but e&s;pecially the Giant, who for want of &s;kill receiued many more then o|therwi&s;e he n&eacute;eded to haue doone: which cau&s;ed him to fret and chafe exc&eacute;edingly. And b&eacute;eing minded to delay y^e fight no longer, he rai&s;ed him&s;elfe in his &s;tirrups, and deliuered a full blow at his enemies head, who &s;&eacute;eing it comming, and b&eacute;eing afraid to take the &s;ame, hee lightly raind backe his hor&s;e, &s;o that the Giant mi&s;&s;ing his marke, was not able to recouer his blow, which lighted &s;o fully on his owne hor&s;e head, that he cleft it in two, and therewithall tumbled him|&s;elfe to the ground: but as great hap was, he fr&eacute;ed him&s;elfe &s;o well in the fal, that before <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> could take any aduan|tage again&s;t him, he had recouered his f&eacute;ete, which he per|ceiuing, likewi&s;e allighted, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elfe, they began a more fierce combat then that on hor&s;ebacke, the Giant &s;till hauing the wor&s;t, till at la&s;t, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> &s;tepping backe to auoyde a blow which the Giant made at him, h&eacute;e vnluckily &s;tumbled, and withall fell to the ground, recei|uing in the fall a great wound on his right thigh, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, and fearing the death of his friend, he leapt lightly from his hor&s;e, and came to &s;aue him, which was doone with &s;uch &s;p&eacute;ede, that y^e Giant could not execute the crueltie which otherwi&s;e he would, but was
<PB REF="93"> forced to turne about to defend him&s;elfe from his newe ad|uer&s;ary: who beganne to deliuer him &s;uch blowes, as made the beholders &s;oone iudge who &s;hould haue the victory. For he gaue not one blow in vaine, but it did eyther breake in peeces his Armor, or wound his body, which now through lo&s;&s;e of blood began to grow weake. On the contrary &s;ide, his blowes which he gaue vnto the Knight, had not y^e force &s;o much as once to pierce his &s;hielde, &s;o impregnable was the &s;trength thereof, which cau&s;ed the Giant to cur&s;e and bla&s;pheme his Gods, who were not able to deliuer him fro~ one alone Knight. And b&eacute;eing in this rage, he thought with one blow to haue fini&s;hed the battell, wherefore vniting all his forces together, he &s;trake the Knight &s;uch a blow on the &s;hield, that had it b&eacute;en of any other mettell, he had cleft it in the mid&s;t, but to this it did no harme at all, but with that blow he brake his Semiter, cau&s;ing the Knight to &s;et one kn&eacute;e to the ground: but b&eacute;eing againe recouered, hee pur|&s;ued the Giant with &s;uch fierce blowes, that &s;oone he cau&s;ed him to fall at his f&eacute;ete: which <HI>Furioll</HI> perceiuing, cryed vnto him to &s;aue his life, but the Knight not &s;&eacute;eming to harken vnto him, cut off his head.</P>
<P>The Giant <HI>Furioll</HI> &s;&eacute;eing his companion &s;laine, drew forth a mighty broad Fauchon, and running at the knight &s;aid: Villaine, wherfore ha&s;t thou &s;laine him that was not able to defend him&s;elfe, I hauing likewi&s;e cryed vnto thee to haue &s;pared him, but &s;&eacute;eing thou ha&s;t &s;o cruely dealt with him, I will &s;end thy &s;oule for a &s;acrifice vnto him. Doe thy wor&s;t replyed the Knight, for I &s;lew him becau&s;e I did not feare th&eacute;e: and if thou looke not the better to thy &s;elfe, I doubt not but to &s;end th&eacute;e to beare him company with the dead, whom liuing y^u ha&s;t b&eacute;en a companion vnto in many mi&s;chiefes, then hurling together, they beganne a cruell combat.</P>
<P>The Knight hauing borne &s;ome two or thr&eacute;e of his wei|tie blowes, (which although by the goodnes of his Armour did not wound his body, yet were they of &s;uch force y^t they did compell him to bend with his kn&eacute;es to the ground, and
<PB REF="94"> now minding with him&s;elfe to auoyde the &s;ame) began to round &amp; trauer&s;e his ground, often auoyding his enemies force, &amp; indangering his huge body both with blowes and thru&s;ts, which hee gaue with &s;uch good and &s;kilfull know|ledge, that the blood i&s;&s;ued foorth abundantly, to the great ioy and admiration of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince, and the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, who in a manner h&eacute;ereby were in a&s;&s;urance of their deliuery: wondring in theyr minds what he might be, that with &s;uch force was able to co~tend with the Giant <HI>Furioll.</HI> Thus continued they fighting by the &s;pace of two howres, not &s;o much as once taking breath, whereby the Knight had the aduantage, as b&eacute;eing more v&s;ed to &s;uch combats then the Giant, who now was in a manner cleane wearied, and &s;o farre out of breath, that he did nothing but pant and blow, which the Knight perceiuing, pur&s;ued him the fa&s;ter, dealing &s;uch blowes with the tru&s;tie blade of <HI>A|driano,</HI> that cau&s;ed his body to lie open to the keene edge thereof, &s;o that the gra&s;&s;e wheron they fought, was cleane couered with his blood, him&s;elfe not hauing giuen any wou~d to his aduer&s;ay, although in many places he had bru|&s;ed his Armor: and now b&eacute;eing ouercharged with his ene|mies blowes, and growing faint through his great phle|bottomy, fell to the ground in a &s;wound. The Knight thinking to haue &s;laine him, was called vnto to ha&s;ten vnto the wicket, which if he did not make y^e greater &s;p&eacute;ed, would be clo&s;ed again&s;t him, wherefore leauing the Giant &s;wel|tring in his owne blood, he ranne vnto the gate, and finding one clo&s;ing the wicket again&s;t him, he gaue him &s;uch a blow that he cleft him to the brea&s;t: and entring in, hee began to deale his dole among&s;t the~ that made any re&s;i&s;tance, which were not many.</P>
<P>Then came vnto him the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prince <HI>Don Iago</HI> and y^e re&s;t, giuing him infinit thankes for his great paines, which hee had taken for their deliuery: de&s;iring him to put off his Helme, that they might &s;ee his face and knowe him, who had &s;o nobly wrought their deliuerance. The Knight beeing loth to deny their reque&s;t, e&s;pecially that of y^e Prince
<PB REF="94"> <HI>Iago,</HI> whom hee perfitly knew, and of who&s;e being there he did not a little meruaile, whithout any more ceremo|nies put of his Helme. But when the whole company be|held his young yeares and great beauty, which by his heate was the more augmented, they did greatly admire his rare prowe&s;&s;e: but what man liuing is able to expre&s;&s;e the exc&eacute;eding ioy, which the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> inioyed when h&eacute;e beheld him: who running pre&s;ently vnto him, imbra&s;t him in his armes, &s;aying. O brother, how happy am I &s;o inioy this your pre&s;ence in a time &s;o n&eacute;edfull: who&s;e ab&s;ence hath b&eacute;en a greater griefe vnto me then my tongue can expre&s;&s;e. The Knight of the Lions being as glad to &s;&eacute;e him, v&s;ed him with the like kindne&s;&s;e, demaunding by what aduenture he came thether, and how the Duke his father, his Mother, and the Prince&s;&s;e his &s;i&s;ter fared, all which was deferred vntill a more conuenient time. Then was hee imbraced of the Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> and the re&s;t, at who&s;e intreaty he pardoned Sir <HI>Pe&s;trell</HI> the Dukes Co&s;in: and for the courti&s;ie which hee had &s;howed them, during their impri&s;onment, they v&s;ed him very kindly. Then the Knight of the Lions commaunded <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> to be &s;ent for, and his wounds to be dre&s;&s;ed, declaring vnto the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> that it was the &s;ame Knight for whom he left <HI>Saxonie</HI> to goe into <HI>Ireland</HI> to combat with all. H&eacute;ere after they had re&s;ted them&s;elues by the &s;pace of fiue daies, hauing &s;ent word of this fortunate deliuerance, to y^e Court of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they determined altogether to ride thether, where in thr&eacute;e daies they arriued with ea&s;ie iournies, by rea&s;on of the wounds of <HI>Adre&s;to.</HI> And at their comming foorth of the Ca&s;tle, with a mighty clap of thunder, the Ca&s;tle and dead bodies of the Gyants were vani&s;ht cleane out of &s;ight, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of them all.</P>
<P>And now being as I haue &s;ayd come to the Citty of <HI>Par|ris,</HI> they were royally welcomed, and intertained by the King, the Qu&eacute;ene, the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia, Oliua:</HI> and all Nobles of the Court, vnto whom the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> declared the whole di&s;cour&s;e of euery particuler accedent,
<PB REF="95"> touching their impri&s;onment and deliuery. Which when the King had heard, he made a &s;olemne vow to be reuenged on the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and his whole family: but at the intreaty of the Prince, he pardoned Sir <HI>Pe&s;trell,</HI> who af|terwards prooued a good and hardy Knight. Thus pa&s;&s;ed they away the time in the <HI>French</HI> Court, by the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e w&eacute;ekes, each friend recounting to other their &s;euerall aduentures, and making preparation for the &s;olemnizing of the marriage betw&eacute;ene Prince <HI>Edward</HI> &amp; the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> in which time <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> was fully recouered of his wounds, and being de&s;irous to &s;ee his old loue the Dutches <HI>Lenarda,</HI> ha&s;tned on the Knight of the Lions to depart: whereunto he was very willing, by rea&s;on of the de&s;ire he had to &s;peake with <HI>Adriano.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. How the Knight of the Lions, departing from the <HI>French</HI> Court with <HI>Adresto,</HI> landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> where comming to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> hee deliuered the King his Fa|ther.</HEAD>
<P>_ANd now beeing ready prouided to depart, they came both into the great Hall, where with many ceremonious courti&s;ies, they tooke their leaue of the King, y^e Qu&eacute;ene, the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Emilia,</HI> and <HI>Oliua,</HI> with all the re&s;t of the Nobles of the Court. The two Princes, <HI>Ed|ward,</HI> and <HI>Iago,</HI> &s;&eacute;eing they would n&eacute;edes depart, accom|panied them two daies iourny onwards on their way, during which time the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> de&s;iring pardon of his brother, for not bearing him company, made knowne vnto him his loue to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Oliua,</HI> which by his abode in Court, he doubted not but to obtaine, con&s;idering the great loue and amity, which was betw&eacute;ene him and her father. The Knight of the Lions being well contented h&eacute;erewith, de&s;ired him at his returne, or &s;ending into <HI>Saxonie,</HI> to re|member his duty to the Duke, and Ductches, and his
<PB REF="95"> beautifull &s;i&s;ter the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Egi&s;ena,</HI> whom hee intirely loued: a&s;&s;uring him that as &s;oone as he could learne any certainty, of that which he now went to &s;&eacute;eke for, he would returne thether likewi&s;e, which hee did not doubt but would hapen very &s;hortly. Then taking their leaue of each other, with many kind imbracements, the Prince <HI>Ed|ward</HI> mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreated him, to &s;&eacute;e him at his re|turne out of <HI>Spaine</HI> at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, to which he ea&s;i|ly con&s;ented. Thus they departed, y^e two Princes towards y^e Court, &amp; the Knight of the Lions &amp; <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> towards the Sea-&s;ide, where their &s;hip remained for them: where b&eacute;e|ing arriued, and &s;etting into Sea, they &s;ailed merrily by the &s;pace of two daies, but on the third day the wind al|tring, and the Seas growing very foule, they were forced to put to hull: and being thus to&s;t to and fro by the wind and Seas, by the &s;pace of fiue daies, they were at la&s;t put on &s;hore on the coa&s;t of the Dutchy of <HI>Holland:</HI> where go|ing on &s;hore, and taking their hor&s;es and Armor, minding a little to take the aire after their &s;torme at Sea, they rode onwards in a narrow way, fa&s;t by a plea&s;ant groues &s;ide, where they heard one very pittifully weeping, and li&s;tning attentiuely, they might heare the&s;e few words pronounced. And is it po&s;&s;ible that God will &s;uffer &s;uch cruell and iniu&s;t cu&s;tomes to continue, to the de&s;truction of &s;o many braue and hardie Knights, as haue b&eacute;ene by this wicked cu&s;tome of <HI>Coruew</HI> de&s;troyed. O fal&s;e and di&s;loy|all <HI>Griffory,</HI> that fearing to &s;hew thy malice openly, ha&s;t ordained &s;o vild a cu&s;tome.</P>
<P>The two Knights hearing this complaint, and imagi|ning thereby y^t there was &s;ome cau&s;e extraordinary which mooued the party &s;o to complaine, alighted, and went into the Groue, where they found a Squire lying on the earth, his face all blubbred with teares, and demaunding him the cau&s;e of his &s;orrow, was giuen by him to vnder&s;tand of the cu&s;tome of <HI>Coruew,</HI> where not long &s;ince the Duke of <HI>Lit|&s;enburge</HI> his Lord and Mai&s;ter, hauing bin by the &s;pace of 20. y&eacute;eres trauelling in &s;earch of his &s;oueraigne, the noble
<PB REF="96"> King <HI>Frederick</HI> of Denmark, during which time he had ac|compli&s;hed many great and hardy d&eacute;edes of Armes, and now returning home into his owne Country, with intent no longer to &s;&eacute;eke after y^e which was impo&s;&s;ible to be found, trauailing along by a Ca&s;tle not pa&s;&s;ing a daies iourney hence, where the Duke of this Country hath erected a cu|&s;tome, that no Knight &s;hall pa&s;&s;e that way, but fir&s;t he &s;hall leaue his hor&s;e and Armor behind him, vnle&s;&s;e hee conquer the Gardants, which is a thing impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e of the number: and then he declared the fame as it is more at large expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> hearing of this cu&s;tome, and greatly pittying the lo&s;&s;e of &s;o many hardie Knights as were there daily impri&s;oned, beganne to grow into a great longing to make triall of the &s;ame: wherefore &s;ending backe <HI>Gillimo</HI> vnto the &s;hip for &s;uch things as they wanted, and to giue direction to the Marriners, that if with in ten dayes they did not returne, that then they &s;hould di|rect their cour&s;e for <HI>Spayne,</HI> whether they would peraduen|ture trauell by Land: and willing <HI>Gillimo</HI> to follow them with as much &s;p&eacute;ede as hee could, they departed towards <HI>Coruew,</HI> that night lying at a Village not pa&s;&s;ing a league and a halfe from the Ca&s;tle. And the next day early in the morning hauing heard Diuine &s;eruice, and taking a &s;mall repa&s;t, they rode directly towards the Ca&s;tle. <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> ha|uing de&s;ired to make the fir&s;t triall of his vallour, and now beeing come vnto the place where the Shield hung at the bridge-foote, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> &s;trooke the &s;ame &s;o hard and rudely with the blunt end of his Launce, that he cau&s;ed the whole Vally to re&s;ound with the noy&s;e thereof. Pre&s;ently i&s;&s;ued foorth one of the Knights gardants, and mounting on his hor&s;e, came vnto <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> demaunding what hee &s;ought. Entrance aun&s;wered <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> which if it be denied I will purcha&s;e with my &s;word. Then &s;etting &s;purres to theyr hor&s;es, they met together with &s;uch fury, that the Knight of the bridge was &s;ent headlong to the ground: and after him came foorth another, who was likewi&s;e &s;ent to beare him
<PB REF="96"> company, breaking his necke with the fall, <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> neuer &s;o much as once moouing in his &s;addle: and to be briefe, &s;o good was his hap, that with one &s;peare hee di&s;mounted the fir&s;t fiue Knights, not any of them b&eacute;eing able to ri&s;e from the ground. Then taking choice of a fre&s;h hor&s;e, and a new Launce, for that his old one was remaining broken in the body of him whom hee la&s;t di&s;mounted, hee went on to the farther end of the Bridge, where he found two of the other fiue ready mounted, and vailing their Launces, they ranne together in &s;uch &s;ort, that breaking both their Launces on his &s;hield, it cau&s;ed him a little to &s;tagger: but he with who~ <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> met, was &s;ent to mea&s;ure his length on y^e ground, then encountring with the other againe, hee ran his launce cleane through his body, him&s;elfe b&eacute;eing a little wounded on the right &s;ide.</P>
<P>Then taking a new Launce, hee prepared to runne a|gain&s;t the other thr&eacute;e, but before he ranne, the Knight of the Lyons intreated him to giue ouer the Iou&s;ts to him, as be|ing more fre&s;h and lu&s;tie: but h&eacute;ereunto <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> would not in any &s;ort agr&eacute;e, but de&s;ired him to permit him to end the aduenture if he could: and if hee did faile therein, then that he would proc&eacute;ede in the &s;ame him&s;elfe. And h&eacute;erewithall againe he &s;ette &s;purres to his hor&s;e, and encountring with them all thr&eacute;e at once, gaue him that was on the right &s;ide of him &s;uch a blow, that he cau&s;ed him to fall ouer his hor&s;e taile: but the other two m&eacute;eting him fully at one in&s;tant, brake theyr Launces in the mid&s;t of his &s;hield, cau&s;ing both hor&s;e and man to tumble to the ground, but &s;oone had hee recouered his f&eacute;ete, and was againe remounted by his Squire, who brought him his owne hor&s;e, &amp; pre&s;ented him with a Launce. Then b&eacute;eing mounted, he incountred a|gaine with the other two, who at the &s;econd cour&s;e he like|wi&s;e &s;ent to beare theyr fellowes company, him&s;elfe b&eacute;eing &s;ore bru&s;ed and wounded in two or thr&eacute;e places of the body, wherby he lo&s;t a great deale of blood: and likewi&s;e his hor&s;e was &s;o ouerwearied, that hee was no longer able to beare his body. Wherfore he di&s;mounted, minding to haue chan|ged
<PB REF="97"> his hor&s;e, but as hee was &s;o dooing, hee e&s;pied the fiue Knights with whom he was to deale withall comming to|wards him on foote, wherfore drawing forth his &s;word, and dre&s;&s;ing his &s;hield on his arme, he went again&s;t them with a mo&s;t bold and vndaunted courage: and b&eacute;eing come to|gether, was the fir&s;t that gaue the on&s;et, which hee perfor|med with &s;uch ine&s;timable prowe&s;&s;e, that within le&s;&s;e then twenty blowes, he had &s;ent one of them to &s;&eacute;eke pa&s;&s;age of old <HI>Caron:</HI> the re&s;t perceiuing the death of theyr fellow, be|gan with more furie to a&s;&s;ault him, whereby he was driuen to his trumps, for they were all foure &s;toute and hardy Knights. Thus continued the fight by the &s;pace of an howre, many wounds b&eacute;eing giuen on both &s;ides, &s;o that the ground was all couered with blood: and now <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> f&eacute;eling him&s;elfe grieuou&s;ly wounded, &amp; his &s;trength through weari&s;omne&s;&s;e &amp; lo&s;&s;e of blood to decrea&s;e, minding to &s;hew courage to the end, vnited all his forces together, and de|termining to end his life with honour, ranne fiercely vpon them, giuing one of them &s;uch a blow on the head, that h&eacute;e cleft him to the t&eacute;eth: then turning to another of them who had wounded him behind, gaue him &s;uch a di&s;charge, that for euer after he was fr&eacute;e from any more &s;uch combats, ha|uing both his armes cut off. The other two &s;&eacute;eing this, and fearing the like, would willingly if they could haue de&s;i&s;ted fro~ the battel: but he pur&s;ued them with &s;o mighty blowes, that at length they fell both at his f&eacute;ete, the one of the~ &s;tarke dead, the other crying for mercy, which he obtained.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> b&eacute;eing very faint, &s;ate downe on y^e gra&s;&s;e, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, came towards him to helpe him, but before h&eacute;e could come vnto him, <HI>A|dre&s;to</HI> was falne into a &s;wound: wherefore commending him vnto their Squires, hee prepared him&s;elfe again&s;t the other fiue Knights, which by this time were come euen vn|to him: and at the fir&s;t incounter, gaue one of them &s;o rude a blow, that cutting away both &s;houlder and right arme, h&eacute;e cau&s;ed him to fall dead to the ground, then turning to ano|ther, he tooke of at one blow his head.</P>
<PB REF="97">
<P>The other thr&eacute;e &s;&eacute;eing this, be&s;et him round about, lay|ing at him withall their force, which was far weake to doe him any hurt: &s;o impierceable was his Armor, which at this time &s;toode him in good &s;t&eacute;ede, for hee being &s;ure from wounding, n&eacute;eded not to take any paines but only in of|fending, which he did with &s;uch agillity, that in le&s;&s;e then halfe an houre, hee had &s;ent them all to &s;&eacute;eke pa&s;&s;age into another world. Then had he time a little to breath him&s;elfe, and al&s;o to &s;&eacute;e <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> who by this time, by the carefull indu&s;trie of the Squires, was come to him&s;elfe againe, and had his wounds bound vp, being &s;omewhat weake and fainty, with his great lo&s;&s;e of blood which he &s;u&s;tained. And now the Knight of the Lions, &s;&eacute;eing there was no great doubt of his recouery, went towards the Ca&s;tle, to prouoke the Gardants, if otherwi&s;e they would not com foorth, to the battaile.</P>
<P>But euen as hee was come to the gate, fiue who&s;e lot was next to fight came foorth, and all at once &s;et on him, but he like a &s;econd <HI>Hercules,</HI> amid&s;t the eleauen Gyant-like brethren, fir&s;t receaued al their blowes vpon his &s;hield, to try the &s;trength of their armes, and hauing once felt the weight of all their forces, he directed his &s;word again&s;t him, who&s;e blowes hee thought might doe him the greate&s;t da|mage: and giuing him a full blow beneath the &s;hield, par|ted him right in the wa&s;t, then laying on among&s;t them with equall dole, he made from &s;ome their heads, from o|thers their armes and legges to fly into the field. And now foure of them being kild in the place, the other beganne to fly as fa&s;t as he could towards the wicked, but before h&eacute;e could attaine halfe of the way, the Knight of the Lions o|uertooke him, &amp; gaue him &s;o full a blow vpon the head, that he cleft him downe to the girdle: to the amazement of the beholders, who &s;toode vpon the battlements of the Ca&s;tle, almo&s;t fearing to goe foorth to fight with him, but being vrged, both by their oath, and al&s;o by the commaundement of their Captaine, the nex fiue went foorth, but were in a manner no &s;ooner i&s;&s;ued, but that they &s;ought meanes to
<PB REF="98"> returne againe, &s;uch incredible feare had they of his weigh|ty blowes. But h&eacute;e &s;&eacute;eing their intent, and minding to pre|uent the &s;ame, got lighty betw&eacute;ene the gate and them: and now hauing already &s;laine thr&eacute;e of them, and woun|ded the other two, hee beganne to fall into con&s;ideration with him&s;elfe, that if he did not take the time, whiles it pre|&s;ented it &s;elfe vnto him to enter into the Ca&s;tle, he might when he would, peraduenture be bard of the like oportu|nitie. And con&s;idering withall the goodne&s;&s;e of his Armor, &amp; vnwillingne&s;&s;e of the defendants to come foorth, determi|ned to enter whil&s;t the wicket was open: wherefore &s;tep|ping a little to the right hand, he gaue one of them &s;o &s;ore a blow on the left &s;houlder, that cau&s;ed him to fall to the ground, and h&eacute;erewithall hee lept &s;uddenly to the wicket, and got in thereat: which they of the Ca&s;tle perceauing, and with all fearing the &s;equell, bee ganne to arme them|&s;elues, and all at once to a&s;&s;ault him, &s;ome with &s;words, o|ther with Launces, &s;ome others againe betooke them to throwing of &s;tones, &amp; diuers engines of iron at him, where with he was greatly troubled. But &s;eeing no remedy, but either to conquer or die, he couered him&s;elfe with his &s;hield, and with his tru&s;ty blade in his hand, hee made &s;uch way among&s;t them, that he thought him&s;elfe &s;ure&s;t, that was farthe&s;t off from him: &s;o that within y^e &s;pace of two houres, he had not left aboue &s;ixe of them liuing: all which were likewi&s;e very &s;ore wounded, &amp; beeing vtterly voyd of hope to e&s;cape his conquering arme, determined to &s;ubmit them&s;elues to his mercy, hoping thereby to &s;aue their liues, which otherwi&s;e they could not long pre&s;erue. Wherefore falling on their kn&eacute;es, with one voice they cra|ued mercy, which he &s;oone graunted vnto them, being as I haue many times before &s;aid, naturally inclined to pitty. And willing them to &s;tand vp, hee demaunded what pri&s;o|ners there were in the Ca&s;tle, and for what occa&s;ion that cu&s;tome was there erected: all which one of them at large recounted, declaring how that the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> as yet remained there, with diuers other noble and gallant
<PB REF="98"> Knights. Which when the Knight of the Lions heard, h&eacute;e commaunded &s;traight waies to be conducted vnto the pri|&s;on: and likewi&s;e that <HI>Adre&s;to</HI> &s;hould be brought in, and his wounds dre&s;&s;ed by the Surgian of the Ca&s;tle, which was a man greatly experienced in that &s;cience, all which was pre&s;ently performed. And one of the Knights running to one of them that was &s;laine, tooke from him a bunch of keyes, wherewith he opened a little iron doore, and di&s;cen|ding downe a narrow paire of &s;taiers, they came to a dun|gion vnderground, at the entry whereof was another iron doore, which they likewi&s;e opened: then hauing a torch lighted in their hands, they vnchained all the pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom they found King <HI>Frederick,</HI> y^e Lord <HI>Gwal|tero</HI> his Co&s;in: the Duke of <HI>Lit&s;enburge,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Me|new,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and diuers others, to the number of a hundred, all or mo&s;t part Knights of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Many of which were &s;ore pined away, and almo&s;t fami&s;hed through their extreame griefe and cour&s;e fare: but the King, the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> were little or nothing altred for all their long impri&s;onment. And now being all brought foorth into the great Hall of the Ca&s;tle, they with one ac|cord gaue harty thankes vnto the Knight of the Lions, and then falling on their kn&eacute;es, with one con&s;ent they gaue prai&s;es to almighty God, which being ended: the King with the noble men came vnto the Knight of the Lions, de&s;iring him to declare who hee was, that they were &s;o much bound vnto for their deliuerance. To which hee aun|&s;wered, that hee was commonly called the Knight of the Lions: But as touching his parents or Country, he knew not, only this he had heard, that being a child, he was ta|ken vp in a Forre&s;t, in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> who &s;ince that time had carefully brought him vp as his &s;onne. Which when the King had heard h&eacute;e imbra&s;t him in his armes, de&s;iring him to accompany him into his Kingdome, where hee would &s;howe him&s;elfe &s;o thankfull vnto him, as hee &s;hould not thinke his labour ill be&s;towed. The Knight beeing by the in&s;tinct of nature,
<PB REF="99"> greatly affected vnto the King, &s;oone con&s;ented h&eacute;ereto, al|though it were farre out of his way towards <HI>Spaine,</HI> whe|ther he was trauelling. For which the King gaue him har|ty thankes, and withall beganne to haue an inward loue towards him: h&eacute;ere continued they by the &s;pace of eight or tenne daies, to refre&s;h their weake bodies, as al&s;o for the curing of the wounds of <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> and making preparation for their Armors, whereof they had great &s;tore in the Ca|&s;tle, &amp; &s;ome hor&s;es: others they got abroade in the Coun|try n&eacute;ere adioyning for their monies. And now hearing that <HI>Grifforie</HI> was gathering his forces to come again&s;t them, they departed towards <HI>Flaunders,</HI> where hearing of the warres and rebellion in <HI>Denmarke,</HI> they determined vnknowne to ha&s;ten thether, and naming them&s;elues to be all Knights arrant, met together by chance: and hea|ring of the&s;e warres were, minded to entertaine them|&s;elues in the armie of the States. With this determination arriued they at the Citty of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> which was &s;till held by the <HI>Danes:</HI> and h&eacute;ere they remained, to prouide them&s;elues of &s;uch things as they n&eacute;eded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. How King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> the Knight of the Lyons, and the re&s;t of theyr company, arriued in the Army of the States, and how the next day they gaue battell vnto the <HI>Scots,</HI> where, by the vallour of the King, the Knight of the Lyons, and theyr company, the States got the victory, and howe the King made him&s;elfe knowne.</HEAD>
<P>_THe King and the re&s;t of his company, ha|uing prouided them&s;elues of all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for theyr iourney, departed from <HI>Gaunt</HI> towards <HI>Denmarke,</HI> b&eacute;eing in all to the number of an hundred Knights, wel furni&s;hed and prouided for the warre. And marching thus together through <HI>Flaunders,</HI> and other pro|uinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> they arriued within thirtie dayes at
<PB REF="99"> <HI>Rensberge,</HI> where the two Armies by the &s;pace of &s;ixe daies had line incamped one again&s;t the other, continually &s;kir|mi&s;hing, but neither &s;ide daring the one to a&s;&s;ault y^e other. And now b&eacute;eing h&eacute;ere arriued, the King and the re&s;t b&eacute;eing di&s;gui&s;ed for feare of being knowne, came vnto the States, de&s;iring entertainement, and withall, declared a long fai|ned circum&s;tance how they had met together: and b&eacute;eing all minded to ayde theyr right and iu&s;t cau&s;e again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> and traytors, they were come together to proffer their &s;eruices. The States b&eacute;eing glad of this &s;uccor, and with|all knowing diuers of them, as the Duke of <HI>Lit&s;enburge,</HI> and others, whom they receiued with great ioy, and gaue entertainment to all the re&s;t, who by the meanes of the Duke were placed in commaund: and entring into coun|&s;ell, they determined to &s;end pre&s;ently vnto the <HI>Scots</HI> to de|maund battell, which by the Earle <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e</HI> was &s;oone graunted: and the next day it was appointed that it &s;hould be tryed by a pitched battell who &s;hould haue the victory.</P>
<P>The morning b&eacute;eing come, and both Armies ranged in the field, the States had deuided their forces into thr&eacute;e bat|talions, the fir&s;t whereof was ledde by the Lord <HI>Louden,</HI> and the County of <HI>Mildrope,</HI> containing eight thou&s;and, the &s;econd or maine battell, was ledde by the Duke of <HI>Lit|&s;enburge,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Opencade,</HI> containing twelue thou&s;and, the third &amp; la&s;t battalion, contayning nine thou|&s;and, was led by the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Ren&s;|berge.</HI> The King, the Knight of the Lyons, with their co~|pany, &amp; &s;ome others, to the number of two hundred, would not at all ioyne them&s;elues with any of the troopes, but in a loo&s;e manner, would make a tryall to breake in on y^e backs of their enemies as &s;oone as the battell &s;hould begin: each one of the~ for their better knowledge to theyr friends, wea|ring on their Helmes a cro&s;&s;e of gr&eacute;ene and corronation co|loured &s;ilke: in this &s;ort was ranged the whole battell of the States.</P>
<P>On the contrary &s;ide, the Earle <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e</HI> placed his Army in another maner, making as it were but one maine
<PB REF="100"> battaile of his whole Armie, in the mid&s;t whereof he placed for his owne gard fiue thou&s;and <HI>Scots:</HI> the re&s;t he intermix|ed with the <HI>Danes,</HI> the greate&s;t part whereof hee placed in the forefront of the battaile: his wings con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t of a light kind of people, which did v&s;e to ca&s;t Darts, beeing ar|med onely with a &s;hort &s;word and target, with which when they came to ioyne blowes, they did great &s;poyle to theyr e|nemies.</P>
<P>And now both Armies b&eacute;eing thus ranged in battaile a|ray, the Drummes &amp; Trumpets &s;ounded, making a mo&s;t ioyfull &s;ound, to them who&s;e harts not daunted with feare de&s;ired to incounter with their enemies: euery Captaine incouraging his men to fight valiantly, and to doe their be&s;t to winne the victory. The chiefe of the &s;tates incouraging theyr &s;ouldiers with the iu&s;tice of theyr cau&s;e, as beeing vr|ged to fight for their fr&eacute;edome and liberty of their Country. By this time were both Armies come together, the Lord <HI>Louden</HI> giuing the fir&s;t charge vpon his enemies, brake his Launce valiantly, and drawing out his &s;word, beeing fol|lowed by his company, made way through his enemies ranks, but &s;oone he was &s;topped from going farre: and had it not b&eacute;ene, that the Duke of <HI>Lit&s;enbege,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Opencade</HI> came with fre&s;h &s;uccours, they had b&eacute;ene all put to the &s;word. For the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;&eacute;eing the violent ra&s;hne&s;&s;e of the Lord <HI>Louden</HI> and the Count <HI>Mildrope,</HI> opened theyr ranks of purpo&s;e, and hauing &s;uffered them to enter&punc; inclo|&s;ed them round about, but now at the co~ming of the Duke, the battell began to grow very hote, in&s;omuch that there were many &s;laine of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> euer k&eacute;eping them&s;elues clo&s;e together, made them&s;elues the &s;tronger, whereas the States for want of &s;kill and knowledge, &s;uffered theyr troopes to breake theyr ranks, to theyr great dammage. Which the Earle <HI>Dow|gla&s;&s;e</HI> perceiuing, with &s;ome twelue or fouret&eacute;ene thou&s;and entred in among&s;t the~, making great &s;laughter where they went. The Earle this day &s;hewing that his y&eacute;eres had not any way taken away the vallor which in his former dayes
<PB REF="100"> he had &s;howed, for it was thought y^t this day hee &s;lew with his owne hands aboue thr&eacute;e&s;core Knights.</P>
<P>Now beganne the <HI>Danes</HI> to fly, tru&s;ting rather to their h&eacute;eles then the defence of their &s;words, which the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Rensberge</HI> perceauing, came in with the rereward, and againe renewed the fight, which before was almo&s;t ended, gathering together the di&s;perced troops of the Duke. But alas to &s;mall purpo&s;e had this their new on&s;et b&eacute;ene, had it not b&eacute;ene that the King with his company of Venturers, hauing fetched about a great hill, which lay on the &s;ide of the battaile, came at the &s;ame in|&s;tant on the backe of their enemies, and withall their might charging them, entred pell mell among&s;t them, killing a great many, before &s;uch time as they could turne their fa|ces, to knowe from whence this mi&s;chiefe came. The King accompanied with the Knight of the Lions, <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> made a plaine way for the re&s;t to follow them, e&s;pecially the Knight of the Lions, who neuer &s;trake &s;troke but was either the death or di&s;membring of &s;ome Knight. The Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> did likewi&s;e the part of noble Knights: &s;o as in &s;hort &s;pace the odds beganne to appeare on the &s;ide of the States, who be|fore were euen vanqui&s;hed. Which when the Earle <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e</HI> &s;awe and grieuing to behold, he with his elec|ted company came to make head, where he &s;awe mo&s;t dan|ger, and perceauing that the Knight of their Lions, was in a manner the whole ouerthrow of his Armie, h&eacute;e &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, and comming vnto him, gaue him a great blowe on his Helme, cau&s;ing him to bend his head forwards. But he &s;oone requited the &s;ame, for lifting vp his &s;word, he gaue the Earle &s;uch a blowe, that had he not warded the &s;ame with his &s;hield, hee had ended therewith his life, for notwith&s;tanding his defence, it cau&s;ed him to fall from his hor&s;e in a traunce, and &s;o was taken pri&s;oner: to the great di&s;couragement of the whole Armie, who pre|&s;ently put them&s;elues to flight, but were &s;o hotly per&s;ued, that they were but few that e&s;caped, but were either &s;laine
<PB REF="101"> or taken pri&s;oners. Of men of name, there was &s;laine of the States the Duke of <HI>Lit&s;enburge,</HI> the Lord <HI>Londen,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Mildrope.</HI> And of the <HI>Scots</HI> &amp; traytors, there was &s;laine Sir <HI>Iames Lewrence</HI> the Earles Co&s;in, the Lord <HI>Crecon</HI> a Scot, and the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> with &s;ome twenty thou&s;and of the Commons. There was taken pri|&s;oners the Earle <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e,</HI> the Vicount Barwicke, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> which two latter, were the next day executed for their rebellion.</P>
<P>Thus the victory b&eacute;eing obtained by the States, they gaue thanks to GOD with publique &amp; &s;olemne prayers, then cau&s;ing the wounded to be cured, they called a coun|&s;ell to determine on their affaires, where all the chiefe of the Armie b&eacute;eing a&s;&s;embled, euery man commended the great vallour of the Venturers, but e&s;pecially that of the Knight of the Lyons, the gr&eacute;ene Knight which was <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> and the two tawny Knights, whereof the one was the King, the other the Lord <HI>Gwaltero.</HI></P>
<P>The King now &s;&eacute;eing it was not good longer to conceale him&s;elfe, &s;toode foorth in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly, and ta|king of his Helme, di&s;couering his face, &s;pake with a re&s;o|nable loude voyce.</P>
<P>My friends &amp; welbeloued Countrimen, I perceaue the long ab&s;ence of your King, hath worne out in many theyr naturall loue &amp; obedience which they ought to haue to theyr natiue Country: and al&s;o in mo&s;t of you the knowledge of me, who by the prouidence of God, and vallour of this no|ble Knight, (poynting to the Knight of the Lyons) am de|liuered from a long and grieuous impri&s;onment, which my Co&s;in <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and many others h&eacute;ere pre&s;ent can well witne&s;&s;e, and now am come vnto the ayde of you my true and louing Subiects. Wherefore it is my will, that the chiefe of tho&s;e con&s;pirators who haue rai&s;ed this rebellion, be to morrow next (to the example of all others) hangd, drawne and quartered.</P>
<P>The whole A&s;&s;embly hearing &amp; &s;&eacute;eing theyr King, who for the &s;pace of twenty y&eacute;eres they all imagined to be dead,
<PB REF="101"> with one voyce cryed aloude, <HI>Long liue King <HI>Fredericke</HI> to raine and rule ouer vs,</HI> and withall, ranne each &s;triuing to come fir&s;t to ki&s;&s;e his hands, and welcome him into his kingdome: greatly de&s;iring to heare the cau&s;e of his long ab&s;ence, which was deferred till &s;ome other more conueni|ent time. This newes was pre&s;ently &s;pred through the whole Army, to the great ioy of all men, which they eui|dently &s;hewed by their &s;houtes and bonfires which they made that night. The next day, the King hauing &s;&eacute;ene the execution of the chiefe Traytors, and pardoning the re&s;t, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all his Army, &s;auing &s;ome few, which he &s;ent to the Townes that were in rebellion, which pre&s;ently y&eacute;el|ded vnto his mercie, he departed towards <HI>Maiance,</HI> hauing &s;till in his company the Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adre&s;to,</HI> whom he intirely loued, and to whom he made many large proffers, if they plea&s;ed to haue &s;tayed in his kingdome. And being come to <HI>Maiance,</HI> he was receiued with the grea|te&s;t ioy that might be by the Cittizens, where he remained by the &s;pace of a month, in the greate&s;t ioy that hart could wi&s;h: &s;aue onely the remembrance of his Qu&eacute;ene did &s;ome|thing hinder the fulnes thereof, which was awhile &s;w&eacute;etned with the delightfull company of his vnknowne &s;onne, where I will leaue them, and &s;o conclude the &s;econd part of this hi&s;tory.</P>
