<HEAD>A Sad, but True Relation, of <HI>Six Seamen</HI> who Sold them&s;elves to the <HI>Devil, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THough this following Relati|on contains matter of very great Wonder and Amaze|ment; neverthele&s;s it comes to our Hands, confirm'd by that &s;uffitient Te|&s;timony, that we offer it to the Reader as a Narrative of unque&s;tion'd Truth and Reputation.</HI></P>
<P>By a Letter from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> of the 23d. of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, written by a Per&s;on of Worth and Credit, in that I&s;land, we have this Relation, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Margaret</HI> from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the 21th. of <HI>December</HI> 95 bound to <HI>Ber|badoes,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="2">in their Pa&s;&s;age one of the Saylers at the Helm call'd to the Ma|&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, and told him, <HI>That he could &s;teer no longer.</HI> The Ma&s;ter asking the rea&s;on, he replyed, <HI>That he was not well;</HI> and for that cau&s;e quitted his Po&s;t; the Ma&s;ter taking the Helm, the &s;aid Sailor further de|clared, That there &s;tood a Spirit by the Binnacle, that accus'd him of kil|ling a Woman; a Fault which the Spirit had fal&s;ly charg'd him with; for he never committed any &s;uch un|manly Crime in his Life. The Spi|rit, he &s;aid, further told him, That all the Ships Company had &s;ign'd an Agreement with the Divel, which was us'd as an Argument for him to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The next day the Fellow fell into &s;trange Deliriums, and talk'd of wonderful Accidents that would be|fal the Ship; which were look'd up|on
<PB N="4" REF="3">as nothing but the wild Notions of his crazed Sen&s;es, the Chimera's of Frenzy. Particularly he &s;aid, <HI>That the Spirit had brought a Boat to fetch him away;</HI> with other ridiculous idle Di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>Upon the 17th. of <HI>January</HI> in the Latitude of 19 about 9 at Night, a &s;mall white Cloud aro&s;e, without a|ny Rain, or extraordinary Wind, which pre&s;ently falling upon the &s;hip pre&s;&s;ed her down with that &s;trange and indeed &s;upernatural Weight and force that the Hatches flew out, and the whole Ship was under Water, by which unhappy Accident, the Boy was wa&s;h'd off and drowned.</P>
<P>But here to begin the more Mira|culous Part of my Narrative, the Ship continued under Water for E|leven Weeks; a thing that &s;truck (as may be well imagined) an ex|traordinary
<PB N="5" REF="3">Con&s;ternation and Con|fu&s;ion through the Marriners, from &s;everal &s;trange Arguments of their A&s;toni&s;hment. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Ship &s;hould be wholly immerged under Water, and yet not &s;unk downright to the bottom. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That tho' they were apparently thus intirely under Water, yet the Ship was not wholly filled with Water, but that they had Air enough to breath in, by which means they continued a|live; feeding all this while, upon raw meat, and fre&s;h Fi&s;h which came &s;wimming over the Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;eve|ral of which they Caught and Eat. Their Lodging was on Boards pla|ced athwart the Rail near the Taffrel covered with a Sail. The men were always wet which, in &s;o long a time, made that Impre&s;&s;ion upon them that their Fle&s;h on their Bodies was gal|led and raw.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>But what was the mo&s;t di&s;mal part of all, Six of the Ship's Crew upon the &s;inking of the Ve&s;&s;el under wa|ter, were frighted with <HI>Infernal Spi|rits;</HI> and about 12 the fir&s;t Night were carried away invi&s;ibly, leaving no more then 4 Per&s;ons alive behind them; which indeed gave &s;ome lit|tle Credit to what the fore mentio|ned Sailor at the Helm had declared in his <HI>Deliriums.</HI></P>
<P>After this 11 Weeks Immurement the&s;e wondrous watry Walls, for &s;o I may ju&s;tly call it, the Ship recove|red it &s;elf above Water again; and the fir&s;t Land they could di&s;cover was the I&s;land <HI>Di&s;&s;iado,</HI> which, with &s;o few Hands left, they could not fetch up, by rea&s;on of a &s;trong <HI>Nor|thern</HI> Current that bore again&s;t 'em. The next was <HI>Grand-Terra,</HI> where they met with the &s;ame Di&s;apoint|ment:
<PB N="7" REF="4">But on the 5th. of <HI>April</HI> they run them&s;elves on Shore upon <HI>Guar|delupo;</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Treated them very kindly, not as Pri&s;oners, but as Men in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The names of the Three <HI>Seamen</HI> left Alive are <HI>William Davis</HI> Ma&s;ter (a Man very well known in <HI>London</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Berbadoes</HI> Merchants) <HI>William Cadner,</HI> and <HI>William Bywater.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not only the Original Letter, and the whole Relation, at large; is to be &s;een at Mr.</HI> Lloyd<HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e in</HI> Lumbard-&s;treet, <HI>but likewi&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons are to be heard of, and &s;poken withal upon the</HI> Exchange, <HI>in Atte&s;tation of the whole Truth herein decla|red.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Spirits,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>That tho' Hurricanes and Tempe&s;ts have Natu|ral Cau&s;es, yet there is great Rea&s;on to think they are managed by Spirits:</HI> In Confirmation whereof, he relates many notable In&s;tances of his own, particular Deliverances from the Fu|ry of mo&s;t Boy&s;terous Whirlewinds; namely, when the Reapers in <HI>Eve|&s;ham</HI> Vale, were Hurt, Writhen, and One Killed, &s;ome Friendly Pow|er (for &s;o he expre&s;&s;es it) re&s;train'd the cour&s;e of Gravally Sand, rais'd by a Whirlwind, as it met him in a narrow Lane.</P>
