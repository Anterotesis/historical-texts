<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE High and Mighty States, the States Gene|rall of the United Provinces; concerning the proclaiming of open Wars with England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the third of this in&s;tant Month, the great A&s;&s;embly of the United Provinces met at the Hague, where there was a large Debate touching the proclaiming of open Wars with Eng|land, otherwi&s;e to have re&s;titution and &s;atisfaction for all their &s;hips and Goods taken: But after ma|ture del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">beration touching the apparent dangers that might thereby en&s;ue, the States of Holland gave in their po&s;itive Re&s;ult, declaring, That they were re&s;olved (to the utmo&s;t of their power) to pre&s;erve
<PB N="4" REF="3">a firm League and Union with the States of Eng|land; and to hold a fair corre&s;pondency for the in|crea&s;e of free Trade and Commerce: Whereupon the States and Merchants of Zealand ro&s;e up in great fury, di&s;olved the A&s;&s;embly, and vowed re|venge upon the Engli&s;h; but its thought the States General will be more prudent and wi&s;e then to hearken to the cryes or gruntling of the Bores; for here is a Proverb, That the Cries ot the Gee&s;e are never heard up to Heaven.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, the &s;pirits of many thou|&s;ands are much exa&s;perated, and great are the prepa|rations which are making throughout the United Provinces; The Merchants of Zealand have &s;ent 40 Commi&s;&s;ioners to the States General, to treat with them about &s;etting forth the Summers Fleet, and two hundred &s;hips with Letters of Mart; &s;o that they are again &s;at down in Councel, and its concei|ved that at this Meeting, it will be re&s;olved, to man out about 150 Men of War at the publike charge, be&s;ides what will be &s;et forth by the Merchants, and Others, upon Letters of Mart, which (if things hold at this pa&s;s) our Governors that are well-affected to England, will be in evident danger of utter ruine.</P>
<P>For great are the Conte&s;ts between the Burgo|ma&s;ters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to &s;eque&s;ter their E&s;tates, and bring them to a Tryall
<PB N="5" REF="3">for their lives, if they will not take a cour&s;e to defend and a&s;&s;i&s;t them at Sea. And &s;ome Tumults and Ri|&s;ings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both &s;lain and wounded, and among&s;t the re&s;t &s;ome Engli&s;h, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, and brand them with the mo&s;t infamous Badge of Tray|tors and Con&s;pirators to their Religion and Liber|ties; which they are yet to chu&s;e. And upon this Score, divers Engli&s;h Merchants are prohibited from coming upon the Exchange in Am&s;terdam, and o|ther places. 200 Commi&s;&s;ioners have bin &s;ent to all the Frontier and Haven Towns, to &s;ee how many &s;hips each Town can make ready in three weekes time: And having taken a Li&s;t thereof, upon their return, cau&s;ed the &s;ame to be printed; wherein ap|pears the &s;imilitude of a great Armado, con&s;i&s;ting of about 300 &s;ayl of &s;hips, Danes, Dutch, and Ham|burgers: Be&s;ides they tatk of 200 more to be &s;et forth upon Letters of Mart; but the truth is, they'l talk more by an inch of Candle in their liquor by Land, then they can perform by a whole pound, when they are in their Element at Sea. And although they build Ca&s;tles in the Ayr, make their Accounts in Spain, and re&s;olve to ca&s;t them up in England, by blocking up Dover, Sandwitch, Deal, and other Ports; yet I believe in God, and refer you to the in|clo&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P> From Ireland we hear that the Enemy have uni|ted their Forces, and have had a conjunction with with the Earl of Clanrickard, who&s;e de&s;ign was to have rai&s;ede the &s;iege at Gallaway; but Sir Charles Coot having received intelligence thereof, drew off a party of Hor&s;e and Foot, and intercepted them in their pa&s;&s;age, which the Enemy perceiving, betook them&s;elves to flight, and in great di&s;order expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;everal Pa&s;&s;es; but mo&s;t of them were intercepted, about 1500 &s;lain upon the place, and 700 taken pri&s;oners: Thus it plea&s;ed Divine Providence &s;o to bla&s;t and maugre their de|vices and &s;tratagems, that of 4000, there e&s;caped not above 1800; But in their Retreat they were met withall by Col. Sanchy, who charged them, and after a &s;harp di&s;pute, routed them, killed many, and took divers pri&s;oners; pur&s;uing the re&s;t as far as the Bog of Moneal, where taking advantage of the fro&s;t entred the Bog, &s;tormed the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of Mon|donall, and put all to the &s;word: After which great &s;ucce&s;s, he marched to another &s;trong Hold (three miles di&s;tant) called Dublin; which place contained 800 Hou&s;es, or Cabins; but he immediatly &s;torm|ed that al&s;o and killed 500 upon the place; In this gallant Attempt, the Colonel deported him&s;elf with a mo&s;t magnanimous Spirit, being the fir&s;t man that entred the Works; and the &s;oldiers followed him
<PB N="7" REF="4">&s;o clo&s;e, that they &s;oon became Ma&s;ters of the Town, for which &s;ingular piece of &s;ervice, he gave them the free plunder of the Town, which amount|ed to a great value; as will appear by the Li&s;t inclo|&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Enemy hath lately made a de&s;perate &s;alley out of Gallaway, and fell into our quarters, where they took a prey of neer 100 Cows, and 200 &s;heep; But it plea&s;ed the Lord as they returned, a party of Col. Ru&s;&s;els re&s;cued the prey, fought the Enemy, kill'd 60 of them, and took an En&s;ign, and divers o|thers pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Town hath held out a long time, expecting relief, but now they begin to hearken to a Treaty; and its believed that General Pre&s;ton (their Governor) will de&s;ert them, (leaving them to make their own Terms and Conditions) and be take him&s;elf to a &s;trong Iland of his in the Sea; and truly 'tis high time, for the &s;ouldiery begin to mutiny, and threaten to deliver him up to the mercy of the Parliament, in ca&s;e he will not conde&s;cend to a Rendition of the Town.</P>
<P>But the Governor under&s;tanding the great di&s;tra|ctions of the Souldiery, and perceiving that there was little hopes of Relief, thought it requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve him&s;elf by making an e&s;cape; and accord|ingly attempting the De&s;ign, it proved effectual;
<PB N="8" REF="5">Since which time we hear, that the &s;aid town is &s;urrendred, with all the Ordnance, Arms, Ammunition, Bag and Baggage: which if true, will prove a work very acceptable and advantagious, and much conducing to the intere&s;t of the Common-wealth of Eng|land.</P>
<P>There are 15 Dutch Captains arrived here from the Barbadaes. who affirm, That the Engli&s;h turn'd them out of all their &s;hips, only gave them a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el to car|ry them home; but were forced to &s;ell the &s;ame to buy them provi&s;ions: This doth exceedingly inrage them, and they have vowed revenge either by Sea or Land.</P>
