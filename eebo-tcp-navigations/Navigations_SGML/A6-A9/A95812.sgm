<HEAD>THE Un&s;atisfied LOVERS. <HI>PART</HI> I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> was never in greater Splendor, than when the Illu&s;trious <HI>Mary,</HI> Queen of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">cot|land,</HI> made the fair Additions of her Crown and Per&s;on to it, by her Marriage with <HI>Fran|cis,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5">Daulphine, and Heir to <HI>Henry the Second,</HI> the la&s;t King that had I&s;&s;ue of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois:</HI> She was a Prince&s;s, that ow'd nothing to her Dignity, but her Mi&s;eries; for had She been Born in the lowe&s;t State of Life, her Vertues wou'd have made her Eminent. She was Beautiful in her Per&s;on, and as well by Nature, as E|ducation &s;o refindly great, She &s;eem'd only born to &s;upport the Glory of the Greate&s;t Court, that ever <HI>Europe</HI> knew: For what made her Court the only Circle of Wit and Quality, was becau&s;e the Queen was of &s;o di&s;&s;embling, ba&s;e, and po|litick a Nature, and the Princes <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (the King's Si&s;ter, af|terwards
<PB N="3" REF="5">Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI>) &s;o proud, that all tho&s;e who &s;ought only to divert them|&s;elves, &s;hun'd them as much as Re&s;pect wou'd give 'em leave.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the re&s;t that often paid their Duty to the <HI>Daul|phine-Queen,</HI> for &s;o they call'd the Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being Married to the <HI>Daulphine,</HI> was <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> a Woman of a clear and piercing Wit; and &s;o delightfully quick in her Conver&s;ation, that every Bo|dy was pleas'd in her Compa|ny; and tho' at the bottom &s;he was really good, yet &s;he had &s;till the Fate of Wit; which hating to move in the dull com|mon Rode, becomes the Cen|&s;ure of the Ignorant, and Ill|natur'd.
<PB N="4" REF="6">Before &s;he was Fif|teen, (e're Love had taught her to di&s;tingui&s;h) &s;he was Married by her careful Parents to the <HI>Count de St. Maure,</HI> who was both Hand&s;ome, and of a very con&s;iderable Fortune, and had certainly made a mo&s;t ex|cellent Husband to any Wo|man, that had had le&s;s Wit.</P>
<P>As to her Per&s;on, &s;he might ju&s;tly boa&s;t of one of the be&s;t Shapes that ever was &s;een; and though &s;he had not in her Face tho&s;e charming Stroaks of perfect Beauty, yet &s;he had &s;omething &s;o agreeable and plea&s;ing, that all the World admir'd her: The Quickne&s;s of her Wit, and the little plea|&s;ant Satyr, which naturally
<PB N="5" REF="6">fell in her Di&s;cour&s;e, made all tho&s;e, who were indu&s;trous in &s;eeking their Diver&s;ions, make her of their Party.</P>
<P>Though Love was Trium|phant in almo&s;t every Brea&s;t, and Gallantry appear'd the greate&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Court, yet <HI>Madam de St. Maure</HI> had &s;till her Thoughts unmov'd with any Pa&s;&s;ion; her Mind was in a &s;oft Repo&s;e, and be|ing &s;ecure in peaceful Inno|cence, &s;he injoy'd all the Plea|&s;ures of Life, without the Pain; till <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Cha&s;tillon,</HI> (a Cozen of the renown'd Admi|rals) came to <HI>Paris,</HI> a Man gallant to the la&s;t Degree; and though he was extreamly quick, yet he was not eloquent,
<PB N="6" REF="7">which Nature &s;upply'd another way; for &s;o judicious an Ho|ne&s;ty appear'd in all his Words, that they per&s;waded above the Power of Eloquence. He had not pa&s;s'd many Months there, ere he made a Friend|&s;hip with the young <HI>Count de St. Laurans,</HI> who was one of the neare&s;t both in Service, and Favour, to the <HI>Daulphine-Queen.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Count</HI> was mo&s;t Adroit in all his Exerci&s;es, as having been bred from his Infancy in the be&s;t Academies of <HI>France;</HI> and what heightned yet more his Education, was, that his Nearne&s;s to the <HI>Daulphine-Queen</HI> gave him the frequent Conver&s;ation of all tho&s;e, who
<PB N="7" REF="7">were remarkable for Wit and Breeding; which poli&s;h'd in|to a plea&s;ing Lu&s;tre, what the pains of his former Studies had filled into a noble Form. But above all, he was a particular Admirer of <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> and by his often Vi&s;its to her, had enter'd into a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with her; and one may &s;ay, That two of different Sexes were never purer Friends: It was a Stream of Friend&s;hip, full and flowing, without the lea&s;t Violence, or Rapidne&s;s of an unju&s;t De&s;ire; which gave him occa&s;ion to carry his new Friend <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> to vi&s;it her: She not being well, they made the fir&s;t Vi&s;it but &s;hort, though long enough to rai&s;e in
<PB N="8" REF="8"><HI>Cha&s;tillon's</HI> Mind <HI>Ideas,</HI> that he had never found before: Some|thing appear'd to him in her Conver&s;ation, far above the re&s;t of her Sex. In fine, he was &s;o charm'd with her Wit, that His Soul &s;eem'd to be born up|on her Flights, of Thoughts to Heaven. She being not a little pleas'd with the Sincerity and and Freedom which &s;he found in him, de&s;ir'd the <HI>Count St. Laurans</HI> to bring him often thither; which the <HI>Count</HI> per|form'd every day, all the time of her Indi&s;po&s;ition. The&s;e frequent Vi&s;its rais'd <HI>Cha&s;til|lon's</HI> Admiration into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; he now cou'd find no Quiet when from her; Heaven &s;eemed to appear,
<PB N="9" REF="8">when he beheld her; and Hell when he parted from her. But that &s;evere Mode&s;ty, which govern'd all her Actions, &s;hew'd him no other Pro&s;pect but De&s;pair; yet Love being too &s;trong to yield, his Soul was labouring under the weight of the two mo&s;t furious Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>De&s;pair</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>He never fail'd the Court of the <HI>Daulphin-Queen,</HI> where <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> was con|&s;tant, receiving continual Fa|vours from that excellent Prin|ces. He &s;ought all Opportuni|ty, by which he might (un|minded) &s;peak to her; and &s;he, who was not a little pleas'd with his Di&s;cour&s;e, (though as yet, not approach|ing
<PB N="10" REF="9">any thing of Love,) never deny'd him any. But he was as yet, Alas, &s;o young a Pro|ficient in that Art, that his De&s;pair &s;o far over-rul'd him, that it made him in &s;ilence &s;uffer as much, as if he had un|&s;ucce&s;sfully reveal'd his Pa&s;&s;i|on. But <HI>Love</HI> is of &s;o &s;ubtle a Nature, that every Motion, every Look betrays it. When e're they &s;poke of <HI>Love,</HI> (the common Thearn of Courts) in &s;pight of him&s;elf, pre&s;&s;ed by the abundance of his Mind, he wou'd infer the Pain of <HI>Secret Love;</HI> and lea&s;t &s;he &s;hou'd &s;u&s;pect, he wou'd confirm what he had &s;aid, by in&s;tan|cing &s;ome of the Court, that lay under that unhappy Cir|cum&s;tance.
<PB N="11" REF="9">But in vain he &s;trove to hide it; for well &s;he &s;aw, his Words, in &s;pight of all his Art, bore &s;till a Tin|cture of the di&s;tracted Mind, from whence they &s;prung: At which, &s;he was not at all un|ea&s;y; for there are few Wo|men, but Love a Conque&s;t, when it tends not to the Ruin of their Honours; and &s;he be|liev'd, that he wou'd never re|veal his Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o it wou'd be no great Detriment to her's: Be&s;ides, &s;he liked him well enough, to think the Victory well worth the Pains. But his Pa&s;&s;ion was grown too violent, to remain un&s;een; for the whole Frame of his Nature was alter'd; his Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="12" REF="10">which before was &s;teady and judicious, now was nothing but a rap&s;ody of unchain'd Words: He, who had lov'd a general Conver&s;e, and free Acquaintance, now pa&s;s'd the greate&s;t Part of his unea&s;y Hours alone, in his Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Which wonderfull Change the <HI>Count de St. Laurans</HI> &s;oon perceiv'd; and one Day, find|ing him &s;o alone, pre&s;&s;ed Him by all the Power of Friend&s;hip, to tell him from whence it pro|ceeded: At fir&s;t he an&s;wered him, That it only was an Indi&s;|po&s;ition of the Body, and that the Spleen was really the rea|&s;on of his being &s;o. But the <HI>Count,</HI> knowing the Spleen to be a Di&s;temper incident to &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="10">many People, thought that there needed not &s;o much pain to tell it, if that had been all: and from thence concluded, it was but a feign'd Excu&s;e, to conceal &s;ome weighty Truth; which made him pre&s;s him &s;till more violently, till, at length, <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> (leaning his Head up|on the <HI>Count's</HI> Shoulder) &s;aid; <HI>Oh my Friend! Sure thou did&s;t con&s;pire again&s;t my Quiet, when thou carried&s;t me to that inevita|ble Beauty, that no Man &s;ees unmov'd; to her, who is &s;o Hea|venly Bright, none can behold and Live. Ah! pre&s;s me no farther; but let me in Silence and de&s;pair, end my unhappy Life.</HI></P>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<P>The <HI>Count,</HI> who immediate|ly knew at what his Words di|rected, was much &s;urprized to &s;ee his Pa&s;&s;ion (in &s;o little a time) grown to that Prodigi|ous Height; but &s;ince it was &s;o, he thought it be&s;t, with all Care, to indeavour to divert it. <HI>You have been too blame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>to yield &s;o far to the fal&s;e In&s;inuations of Love, which had you taken &s;ooner, like tender Plants, you might have torn up by the Roots; but now it is grown &s;o &s;trong, that it requires Time, and Labour, to hew it down; a long and painful Ab&s;ence, with all the Force of Re&s;olution. Talk not of Ab&s;ence, without Death</HI> (reply'd <HI>Cha&s;tillon) for I find, when I am but one Day without
<PB N="15" REF="11">&s;eeing her, Nature moves weak|ly in me, and I decline like to that Flower, which bends its fee|ble Head when the Sun &s;ets, but is reviv'd again by his Morning Beams: Be&s;ides I have no Power to quit her; for all my Faculties deny Obedience to my Rea&s;on, and bend towards Her their pro|per Center. If I beheld</HI> (an&s;wer'd the <HI>Count) but the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of Satisfaction for you, I &s;hould offer you all my Power to &s;erve you; but &s;ince I do not, pardon me, if I tell you, No Man (but you) e're ran upon &s;o plain a Ru|ine: Therefore, I do conjure you, for your own Quiet, re-a&s;&s;ume your Rea&s;on, to overcome a Pa&s;|&s;ion that will never let you re&s;t. Think but how much it is below
<PB N="16" REF="12">the Free, and Noble Nature of a Man, to be &s;ubject to the Weak|ne&s;s of a Woman; and then ca&s;t her from thee, as a Thing not worth &s;o many Sighs. Ah! Friend,</HI> (an&s;wer'd <HI>Cha&s;tillon) they talk but ill of Love, that never felt it; Do you believe, I wear my Pa&s;&s;ion as I do my Cloaths, that if I find it unea&s;y, I can ca&s;t it off without Trouble. You much mi&s;take; for as &s;oon as Love enters into a Heart, he becomes Ab&s;olute Monarch o're the Mind, and &s;its in Triumph upon every Thought. But to &s;hew you how kindly I receive your Ad|vice, I promi&s;e you to u&s;e all Means, that I think may help my Cure.</HI></P>
<PB N="17" REF="12">
<P>To &s;hew him, that he in|tended what he &s;aid, he went that Night abroad with him to a Ball, that the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> gave the <HI>King.</HI> Certainly, there never was a more Mag|nificent Entertainment; the prodigious Number of Flam|beaus &s;et in every Window of the Streets, through which the <HI>King</HI> pa&s;&s;ed, made them appear more Bright, than in the cleare&s;t Day: Nor was it in any thing le&s;s great, within the Hou&s;e; for be&s;ides the wonderful Quantity of the Riche&s;t Plate, and Furniture, the Tables were filled with all the delicate Meats, that the mo&s;t indu&s;trious Epicure cou'd prepare. And to add to this,
<PB N="18" REF="13">there was all the Glory of the Court, both Men and Women, dre&s;&s;ed with all the Advantage, that Co&s;t and Pain could give them. The <HI>Count</HI> went Home, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for the Ball; but for <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> his Mind was too much imploy'd on other things, to regard his Dre&s;&s;ing. No &s;ooner were they enter'd, and had pay'd their Duty to the <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Queen,</HI> and the Re&s;t, to whom they ow'd it; but <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> began to look impatiently a|bout, to &s;ee if <HI>Madam de St. Maure</HI> was there; but hearing that the Night before &s;he had taken cold, and therefore dur&s;t not &s;tir abroad, he &s;oon grew weary of the Place; and all
<PB N="19" REF="13">that Pomp and Show, (which but &s;ome few Weeks before, would have given him va&s;t Delight) had now quite lo&s;t their value; for &s;he not being there, he beheld all the Glory of the Court, with &s;uch a dull indifference, that he &s;oon grew weary of it, and Stole away; and immediately &s;ent to &s;eek out the be&s;t Mu&s;ick he could find, both of Voices and In|&s;truments, (for he was now re&s;olv'd to give a Seranade to <HI>Madam de St. Maure</HI>) &s;o weak are Lover's Re&s;olutions, and &s;o &s;oon he had forgot the pro|mi&s;es he made to the <HI>Count St. Laurans,</HI> and having Mu&s;ter'd up his Troop of Mu&s;icians, he commanded them to play at
<PB N="20" REF="14">the end of the Street, nigh her Hou&s;e. No &s;ooner had they began, but &s;he immediately imagined to whom they were Addre&s;&s;ed, and by whom: But when &s;he heard this Song, &s;he thought her &s;elf confirmed be|yond all doubt.</P>

<P>The <HI>Count de St. Maure</HI> (though no way &s;u&s;pecting his Wife, yet) was naturally jea|lous; which gave him a Cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee to whom this Se|ranade was directed; which made him go down to in|form him&s;elf. Now the <HI>Count St. Laurans,</HI> having mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> at the Ball, pur&s;ued
<PB N="22" REF="15">him, as being unwilling to have him alone; when, pa&s;|&s;ing through the Street, and hearing the Noi&s;e of Mu&s;ick, he bad his Coach drive up to|wards it; where he found his Friend <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> at the Head of the Con&s;ort. This Ra&s;h|ne&s;s vext him to the Soul; for he was afraid, le&s;t it might make the <HI>Count de St. Maure</HI> (whom he knew &s;u&s;picious) ob&s;erve <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> more nar|rowly hereafter, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;i|on he knew was grown to that height, that a Thou&s;and Things would betray it every moment to any curious Eye; and he knew, if her Husband perceived the lea&s;t Appearance of it, that the mo&s;t favourable
<PB N="23" REF="15">Con&s;equences would be Do|me&s;tick Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es; which made him not &s;tay long in his Coach, but alighting, told them all to <HI>Cha&s;tillon;</HI> who, at the Thought that his Indi&s;|cretion might be prejudicial to her he loved, &s;tood like a Stone unmov'd, not knowing what to an&s;wer. Ju&s;t in this Inte|rim came down the <HI>Count de St. Maure,</HI> and &s;eeing the <HI>Count de St. Laurans</HI> in the mid&s;t of the Seranade, asked him con|cerning it; who an&s;wered, <HI>That</HI> Mon&s;ieur Cha&s;tillon <HI>gave it to a young Lady, his Neighbour, whom he had a De&s;ign to make his Addre&s;&s;es to hereafter, in the Honourable way of Marriage.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> &s;miled, and took
<PB N="24" REF="16">for a full An&s;wer, and promi&s;ed <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> all his power to &s;erve him, if he would make him his Confident: And then forced them into his Hou&s;e, almo&s;t whether they would or no, and carried them up to his Wife, who not being well, kept her Bed that day. He told her, as &s;oon as ever he entered, all that the <HI>Count de St. Laurans</HI> had told him concerning the Seranade. But when &s;he heard him talk of Marriage, &s;he be|gan to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he had been mi&s;taken all this while, and that what &s;he took for Love to Her, had been dire|cted to &s;ome Other; which gave her a certain pain, that &s;he knew not how to Name;
<PB N="25" REF="16">for it was not Jealou&s;ie, &s;he thought, becau&s;e (as yet) &s;he had not found any Appearan|ces of Love.</P>
<P><HI>It is</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) <HI>a dangerous thing, that</HI> Mon&s;ieur de Cha|&s;tillon <HI>is going to undertake, and few con&s;ider it, as the mo&s;t im|portant Moment of their Lives; but every one thinks he &s;hall be Happy, never regarding the ma|ny mi&s;erable Couples, that are as many In&s;tances to the contrary. But this perhaps may appear un|grateful in me, who have all that the mo&s;t Happy can enjoy in Mar|riage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (replyed St. <HI>Lau|rans</HI>) <HI>our Holy Divines forewarn
<PB N="26" REF="17">the World of Sin, by the Vices of Others, if they are not guilty of any them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> (who dur&s;t not ab&s;olutely deny it, and yet was loath to have her think it true) &s;aid; <HI>Madame, as yet I have not fixt my Re&s;olution; there|fore, it may be, it will only end in a Gallantry: But I am &s;till obliged to you for your kind Cau|tion; which may make me avoid many unquiet Hours, that other|wi&s;e might have fallen upon me.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;poke this with &s;uch a confu&s;ed Awkwardne&s;s, that the <HI>Count de St. Laurans</HI> grew &s;o unea&s;y, that he abruptly took his Leave, (pretending he
<PB N="27" REF="17">was to go to the Ball) le&s;t the <HI>Count St. Maure</HI> &s;hould per|ceive it; but went &s;treight home to his own Lodgings, where he made <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> &s;tay with him all Night.</P>
<P>This doubtful Speech made <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> in pain what to judge; but what made her yet more, was the manner that it was &s;poken in. She be|gan to wi&s;h, that his Court|&s;hip was made to her &s;elf; but yet the Circum&s;tances were too &s;trong, not to believe the contrary; and &s;he found no other way, but to referre to Time the expounding of the My&s;tery: and in the interim, re&s;olve to be at re&s;t. But, Alas!

<P>The Morning being thus pa&s;|&s;ed, they all retired Home, to prepare them&s;elves for a Ball at Night; for which there was great Preparations on all &s;ides; every one &s;eeming to vye with each other, who &s;hould appear with the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s <HI>de St. Maur's</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="24">liking to <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> was grown daily more and more upon her; and particularly, that Day he behaved him&s;elf &s;o gallantly, that &s;omething whi&s;per'd in her Soul, what &s;he would have given the World not to have known: But, in &s;pight of her &s;elf, it told her, That &s;he loved. She wi&s;hed a thou&s;and times, he would declare his Pa&s;&s;ion; but then con&s;idering &s;he was Married, a thou&s;and contrary Wi&s;hes blotted the former out. At length, (being alone in her Clo&s;et) &s;he fell to Pray|ers, hopeing by Supernatural Means to regain her Freedom. But, Alas! her Heart and Tongue too much di&s;agreed, to gain relief that way; for whil&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="25">her Mouth was offering Holy Prayers for Liberty, her con|tradicting Heart was wi&s;hing &s;till to be a Slave. So plea&s;ant were the Chains &s;he wore. At length, almo&s;t di&s;tracted be|tween Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ion, from the Angui&s;h of her Mind, &s;he bur&s;t out into the&s;e Words: <HI>Alas!

Come all ye Pious Phy&s;ici|ans of the Mind, who with your grave Advice, pretend to lead us to the Paths of Bli&s;s, give me a Balm to cure this Wound; and then I'le &s;ay, You are Ma&s;ters of your Art.

<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he was in the height of this Exclamation, one knock|ed at her Door, and told her, That the Count <HI>St. Laurans</HI> was without. When having a little compo&s;ed her &s;elf, &s;he went out to him. The fir&s;t thing he &s;aid to her, he asked her, with an unu&s;ual Impatience, <HI>Who that was that &s;ate nigh her?</HI> de&s;cribing <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poi|ctiers.</HI> She immediately told him; and he frankly reveal'd to her, That &s;ince he &s;aw her, he found a Change in him&s;elf, and a wonderful De&s;ire to &s;ee her again; and that he was ju&s;t going to Court, to try if
<PB N="44" REF="26">he could (by any means) in|gratiate him&s;elf into the Hap|pine&s;s of her Conver&s;ation; to &s;ee if her Soul was as rich in Perfections, as her Body; and &s;o he left her to her painful Thoughts.</P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> who all this while was meditating what way to take, to put a period to his Love, re&s;olv'd at length to de|clare his Love; for his Di&s;ea&s;e was now grown &s;o de&s;perate, that it was u&s;ele&s;s to apply moderate Remedies. He found he could not &s;uffer more by her Anger, than he did by his Silence; for that Death would certainly be the I&s;&s;ue of One, and that he had a Chance
<PB N="45" REF="26">to be Happy in the Other.</P>
<P>Upon which Re&s;olution he went &s;traight to Court, to find out <HI>St. Laurans;</HI> with an In|tention to tell him his De&s;igne; where he found him entertain|ing <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers;</HI> whom he had found in the Drawing-Room, &s;tanding by the Fire, with his Si&s;ter <HI>Made|moi&s;elle D'aupre's,</HI> another of the Maids to the <HI>Daulphine-Queen. Cha&s;tillon</HI> entred into the Conver&s;ation; and, in a &s;mall time, <HI>Madam de St. Maure</HI> came in dre&s;s'd for the Ball, with all the Advantages that Cloaths could give to one, who was on all Occa&s;ions al|low'd the be&s;t dre&s;t Woman
<PB N="46" REF="27">of the Court. But, Alas! her Heart was heavy; &s;he had a Weight of Grief hung at it, without the Power to vent it: For had &s;he &s;taid at home, &s;he would have di&s;appointed the King and Queen, who de|pended upon her for to dance that Night. But though her Soul was all di&s;quiet, her Face betray'd not the lea&s;t Shew of it: For that Di&s;&s;imulation, which (they &s;ay) is natural to her Sex, only in this was kind to her, that &s;he could com|mand her Looks to be of a quite different Complexion from her Thoughts: But &s;till it mitiga|ted not her inward Pain. And it is one of the greate&s;t Fines Heaven &s;ets upon Greatne&s;s,
<PB N="47" REF="27">that they are often forc'd be|fore the World almo&s;t to bur&s;t with Secret Grief in &s;ilence; when the Vulgar may, unmin|ded retire them&s;elves, and by complaining, find &s;ome Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Count</HI> had not much time with <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poi|ctiers;</HI> for every Body was crowding to admire her. Nei|ther was this fir&s;t Encounter advantageous to him; for of all the Men of the Court, &s;he lik'd <HI>Chastillon</HI> much the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ball la&s;ted till it was ve|ry late; but as &s;oon as it was done, <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> went home with the Count; to whom he told his Re&s;olution to declare
<PB N="48" REF="28">his Love. The Count replied: <HI>My deare&s;t Friend, and after that I need not &s;ay, I love you. People are apt to judge accord|ing to the Event of Things, that there are few, to whom we ought to give Advice; e&s;pecially in what concerns them &s;o nearly, as (you &s;ay) this does you: But &s;ince it would appear unkind in me to deny you, I mu&s;t freely tell you, I &s;till advi&s;e you to rally your &s;catter'd Troops of conquer'd Rea&s;on, and once more try if you can overcome this Rebel Pa&s;|&s;ion.

<P>Big with this Re&s;olution, he took his Leave of the <HI>Count;</HI> who all Night, in&s;tead of &s;ound and undi&s;turbed Sleep, found nothing but Slumbers hang up|on his Eyes, full of fair <HI>Ideas</HI> proceeding from the bright Object he had &s;een that day.</P>
<P>The next day he fail'd not to go &s;ee his Si&s;ter <HI>Mademoi&s;el|le D'aupre's,</HI> where he found both <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> and

In which time he was indu&s;trious to make <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> and <HI>Ma|demoi&s;elle de Poictiers</HI> have e|qually a good Opinion of each other. And in this he was &s;o far &s;ucce&s;sful, that in a few days they were &s;eldom &s;een a|&s;under.</P>
<P>That Evening, the Weather being extreamly fair, they all four went out to walk toge|ther: When <HI>Madame de St.

<P>When &s;he &s;aw them, who went before, go out of the great Walk, &s;he began to complain, that going by them|&s;elves, they &s;hould lo&s;e the Company, which to her was all the Plea&s;ure of the Place.</P>
<P><HI>Madam,</HI> (reply'd the Count) <HI>You perchance have rea&s;on to complain; but for my &s;elf, I am too nigh Heaven, to think of any other Happine&s;s.

<P>She knew not what to an|&s;wer him, for &s;he con&s;idered, how dangerous it was to enter into &s;o &s;udden an Engagement with a Man &s;he knew &s;o little; and, on the other &s;ide, &s;he was afraid, that if &s;he &s;hould re|pul&s;e him rudely, &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e a Lover. For as Nature had given her &s;o large a Portion of Beauty, &s;he had given her no le&s;s a Share of Vanity; that &s;he was even to that degree Coquette, as to be plea&s;ed with the rude Commendati|ons of Foot-men, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed out and in.

<P>He waited upon them to their Lodgings; and after|ward returned home more happy, than the greate&s;t Con|queror on the Night of &s;ome important Victory: For he ab&s;olutely believ'd, having at

<P>This made him from time to time pur&s;ue her, where e're &s;he went: He beheld no Day, that he pa&s;&s;ed not away mo&s;t part of its douny Hours in her dear Company.

<P>The <HI>Count,</HI> who perceived the Inconveniencies, that mu&s;t arrive to them both from &s;uch an Amour, apply'd all his Power to break it; not by ad|vi&s;ing, nor railing at her Pa&s;&s;i|on; for he knew, that was only Infant Love, which could be chid away; and their's was grown &s;trong enough, to Laugh at all &s;uch Remedies: Which made him think on a more violent, though a more dangerous way, and hazard
<PB N="61" REF="34">the Name of <HI>Friend</HI> to &s;erve his Friends.</P>
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I believe, you thought I lov'd you well e|nough, to intere&s;t my &s;elf in all your Concerns, when you confi|ded in me &s;o weighty a Secret.

<P>At which words, &s;he fell backwards in her Chair; and, withall the violence of a di&s;tra|cted Pa&s;&s;ion, cry'd out, <HI>Oh! ye cruel Stars, do you heap Moun|tains upon Mountains of Mi&s;ery, and all to over-whelm one weak

<P>Then &s;he told the <HI>Count,</HI> That &s;he &s;aw plainly by the Collours <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> wore the Day of the Tilting, and by o|ther Marks and Signes, that he was in Love with &s;ome Wo|man, to whom he dur&s;t not declare it; and that &s;he had been vain enough to think it was her &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (reply'd the <HI>Count</HI>) <HI>be a&s;&s;ur'd, his Addre&s;&s;es proceed from his belief, that you love him; and therefore, they are ra|ther Effects of his Vanity than Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<PB N="63" REF="35">
<P>After this the <HI>Count</HI> took his Leave, and went to find <HI>Cha|&s;tillon,</HI> in order to the carry|ing on of his De&s;igne, leaving her in a more deplorable Con|dition, than he found her.</P>
<P>He found him alone, pen|&s;ive upon a Couch in his Clo|&s;et, meditating upon the Ex|cellencies of <HI>Madame de St. Maure.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> &s;itting him|&s;elf down by him, began to tell him, That he was &s;orry to bring him &s;uch unplea&s;ing News, which he knew would &s;o much di&s;turb him; but be|ing his Friend, he could not but tell him, That he was ju&s;t then come from <HI>Madame de St.
<PB N="64" REF="36">Maure;</HI> and that he had try'd her always, to &s;ee if &s;he had a|ny Inclination for him: But he found all to the contrary.</P>
<P>To which <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> an&s;wer|ed, That no Man could be &s;ur|prized at an expected Stroke; but that, that &s;hould not at all divert him from the Re&s;oluti|on he had taken, of revealing his Pa&s;&s;ion to her.</P>
<P>They &s;ate together, till it was Court-time; and then went thither, where they found <HI>Madame de St. Maure. Cha&s;til|lon,</HI> failed not watching his Opportunity; and Fortune was quickly &s;o kind, as to give him One. For <HI>Madame de St.
<PB N="65" REF="36">Maure,</HI> leaving the Circle, went into the Balcony, pre|tending to cool her &s;elf; for the va&s;t Company, which was at Court that Night, made the Heat almo&s;t in&s;upportable.

She was con|founded, even beyond the Power of Wit to recover; for, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect &s;ome|thing extraordinary from her not &s;peaking at all, or in the di&s;ordered manner, if &s;he did, &s;he catched at the fooli&s;h Oc|ca&s;ion of a Light &s;he &s;aw in a di&s;tant Street, (which was on|ly Straw, that playing Chil|dren &s;et on Flame) to pretend to be afrightned, apprehend|ing

<P>She returned him no An|&s;wer; but turning &s;hort about, pa&s;&s;ed through the Croud down to her Coach; and &s;o
<PB N="68" REF="38">went Home, in a &s;trange Per|plexity.</P>
<P>She left <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> in a deep De&s;pair: He knew not which way next to move; for he con|cluded by her Carriage, that he had ab&s;olutely ca&s;t him&s;elf, without the utmo&s;t Verge of Hope. And now he believed, he &s;hould never &s;ee her more, but with Frowns upon her Face, which would be to him as &s;o many Darts of Death: But &s;till he re&s;olv'd not to de|&s;i&s;t, till he had her An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Count,</HI> who all this while lived in a doubtful Hap|pine&s;s, being &s;he he loved had &s;o little certainty in her Hu|mour;
<PB N="69" REF="38">for though by all Marks, and Appearances, he had the fir&s;t place in her Affe|ctions; yet &s;till &s;he was &s;o Prodigal of le&s;&s;er Favours to others, that he knew not whi|ther his Felicity was &s;ure or no: And Love is of &s;o ambiti|ons a nature, that it is never &s;a|tisfy'd with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t Part, if it &s;ees any Un|conquer'd behind.</P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> who was think|ing what way to take next, thought of going to vi&s;it Ma|dam <HI>de St. Maure's</HI> Gentlewo|man, (with whom by his fre|quent Vi&s;its to her Lady, he became particularly well ac|quainted) and &s;ee if he could
<PB N="70" REF="39">find any thing from her, that could direct him which way to take. After much di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he confe&s;s'd, that of late, &s;he found her Lady much di&s;turb|ed; and that often &s;he has o|ver-heard her &s;igh, and name his Name. But &s;he did be|lieve her too good a Wife, to entertain a kind Opinion of any Man, but her Husband.</P>
<P>From this he took new Fire, and re&s;olv'd to try once more his Fortune, believing that his la&s;t Repul&s;e might only be an Effect of her Mode&s;ty. Be&s;ides, the next time he &s;aw her, when he expected to meet her full of Anger, &s;he receiv'd him (ha|ving forc'd her Nature to obey)
<PB N="71" REF="39">ju&s;t as &s;he us'd to do; think|ing by that to make him be|lieve, &s;he did not hear what he &s;aid to her in the Balcony.

<P>He &s;ought now all Opportu|tunities, to tell her once more of his Love; which &s;he per|ceiving, cunningly cluded: He &s;eeing of it, and al&s;o the &s;trange indiff'rence with which &s;he &s;poke to him upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, (&s;carce ever &s;een in tho&s;e who love, for &s;he never

<P><HI>Sir,</HI> (reply'd &s;he, interrup|ting him) <HI>I little thought to have heard this &s;ort of Di&s;cour&s;e from you; the only hearing where|of is &s;o much contrary to Duty in me. But &s;ince I believe, your Errour only proceeds from a Cu|&s;tom,
<PB N="73" REF="40">that you Young Men have got among&s;t pou, of paying a Gal|lantry to &s;ome particular Wo|man.

<P>All which &s;he &s;poke with &s;uch a Calmne&s;s, that <HI>Cha&s;til|lon</HI> was now confirm'd of his Mi&s;take; and &s;he, to prevent what might follow, &s;ent imme|diately for her Coach to go a|broad, keeping &s;till &s;ome of her Servants in the Room, till it was made ready.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="41">
<P>Now, none but tho&s;e, who know the Force of Love, can judge with how much Torment &s;he perform'd this <HI>mighty work;</HI> which we may well call &s;o, &s;ince few be&s;ides her &s;elf could be able to have done it: And cer|tainly, had &s;he kept her Word, (con&s;idering the Violence of her Love) her Character might have been writ in the chief Re|cords of Vertue.</P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> now began to con|&s;ider him&s;elf, as in a mo&s;t de|&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;e; which made him think of as de&s;perate Cure, and what would in a little time either bring him Death, or certain Health. Which was, That he would make his Ad|dre&s;&s;es
<PB N="75" REF="41">to &s;ome other Woman; and that if <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> had but the lea&s;t Spark of Love for him, this wou'd blow it up into a violent Flame: And none he thought &s;o fit for this, as <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers.</HI></P>
<P>The Count having been &s;o &s;evere with <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> about his Love, was a&s;ham'd to tell him of his own: Which made him (by Errour) run into a Breach of Friend&s;hip. He cho&s;e her to make his Fal&s;e Court&s;hip to, fir&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he was Beauti|ful, and for that rea&s;on every Body wou'd be the apter to believe his pretended Flame to be true; next, becau&s;e he found
<PB N="76" REF="42">her Coquette enough, to re|ceive his Court: And withal, &s;he having &s;o many Admirers, he might &s;lip him&s;elf out of the Crowd when he would, and no body take notice of it.</P>
<P>He lo&s;t no time, but went immediately into the Circle, where &s;he was; and having &s;ingled her out, he approach'd her with the highe&s;t Flights of Gallantry; but never wou'd declare a formal Pa&s;&s;ion, le&s;t his Honour might &s;uffer, when he &s;hou'd retreat. He took all occa&s;ions to be always in her Company; he follow'd her, and &s;ought her from place to place: And &s;he her &s;elf was &s;o vain, that &s;he never fail'd ma|king
<PB N="77" REF="42">his Addre&s;&s;es publick by all po&s;&s;ible means.</P>
<P>This came quickly to the Ears of the Count, and <HI>Ma|dame de St. Maure:</HI> As for him, whom <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poicti|ers</HI> had beheld with a quite dif|ferent Mine, &s;ince the Ap|proaches of <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> (for, as was &s;aid before, &s;he lik'd <HI>Cha&s;til|lon</HI> better than any body) he re|&s;olv'd not to make a Breach of Friend&s;hip for &s;o light a Mi|&s;tre&s;s, till he had try'd all the Remedies that Rea&s;on &s;hould in&s;truct him, to cure his Love.</P>
<P><HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> con|ceiv'd now, that all was true, which the Count had told her;
<PB N="78" REF="43">and &s;o look'd upon her &s;elf, as the mo&s;t Mi&s;erable of Women: For now the Shock appear'd too great to be with&s;tood; and &s;he fear'd the Violence of her Mind wou'd not only expo&s;e her to her Husband, but to all the World be&s;ides. She had a Thou&s;and different Thoughts, which way to take; and, at length, &s;he concluded, that if the Count (her Husband) came to perceive any thing of it, &s;he wou'd freely confe&s;s it all to him; and, as the la&s;t Proof of her Duty, offer him to leave the Court, and retire with him, and never &s;ee <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> more: To &s;hew him, that tho' &s;he cou'd not command her Affe|ctions, yet &s;he cou'd her Acti|ons.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="43">
<P>But Fortune was kind to her, and &s;ent a favourable War to her Relief: For <HI>Philip the Second,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having rai&s;ed a great Army in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> with an intent to enter <HI>France,</HI> the Count <HI>de St. Maure</HI> was forc'd to retire him&s;elf to a Government he had in <HI>Pi|cardy,</HI> where (they &s;aid) wou'd be the Seat of the War. She took the Advantage of this lucky Event, and made her Trouble pa&s;s to the World under the fal&s;e colour of his Departing; where &s;he might rea&s;onably believe, he might be in danger. Be&s;ides, &s;he took this Pretence to retire her &s;elf from Court for &s;ome time, in
<PB N="80" REF="44">hopes that Ab&s;ence, like cool|ing Lenitives, might allay the raging of her Feaver.</P>
<P>She went to a Country-hou&s;e &s;he had, about two Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Paris,</HI> upon the &s;ame Hill of St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> and a|bout a League from it: It was Ma&s;ter of all the Pro&s;pect of that lovely Plain, where the Silver Scene &s;o often &s;preads its wanton Arms in plea&s;ing <HI>Meanders,</HI> to embrace the Earth. In the Middle of which is placed the Renown'd City of <HI>Paris.</HI> At the Foot of the Hill, on which the Hou&s;e was &s;eated, the River glided gent|ly by, and the De&s;cent from the Hou&s;e to it, was only &s;pa|cious,
<PB N="81" REF="44">and beautiful Gardens. Thither &s;he went, and &s;taid &s;ome time; and found her Mind grew much more ea&s;ie upon the Account of <HI>Cha&s;tillon:</HI> But, Alas! the Fire was only &s;mothered, and not quenched.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>St. Laurans,</HI> who began now to be convinced, that <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poctiers</HI> had never had the lea&s;t &s;park of Affection for him; but that her Beauty, like an <HI>Ignis Fa|tuus,</HI> had led him upon the ve|ry Brink of Ruine; now re|&s;olv'd wi&s;ely to &s;hut his Eyes, and be no more &s;educ'd by that fair, deceitful Leader: But, like a wounded Tyger, he &s;et a Re&s;olution fir&s;t to &s;ummon
<PB N="82" REF="45">up all his Force, and &s;pend his dying Fury on tho&s;e, from whom he receiv'd the Wound. Therefore he went &s;traight to her, with an intent to vent the over-flowing of his Brea&s;t to her; and after that, to deter|mine Love, or Life.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as he &s;aw her, Love grew Triumphant, and his Anger melted away, like Wax before the Fire, that he had only Power to &s;ay; <HI>Ah, Madame!

<P><HI>You have no rea&s;on to accu&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="45">me of Cruelty,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>but you Men never fail laying the Fault on us, when you have a mind to break off Loving.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By all that's Good,</HI> (reply'd the Count) <HI>I love you &s;till &s;o well, that the least kind Word you give particularly to me, comes more welcome, than a Reprieve to him that only waits the Stroke of Death. But, Madam, now you &s;hed your Favours upon O|thers, while I lie cover'd with De&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When Love</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>becomes a Burden, throw it down; I con&s;ent; for I know, 'tis that you wou'd be at: El&s;e, why &s;hou'd you &s;u&s;pect me?</HI></P>
<PB N="84" REF="46">
<P><HI>'Tis beyond Su&s;picion, that 'tis Day, when we &s;ee the Sun,</HI> (reply|ed the <HI>Count</HI>) <HI>and your receiving</HI> Cha&s;tillon<HI>'s Love, is as Pub|lick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Woman</HI> (an&s;wers &s;he) <HI>lives without malicious Reports; and if you are &s;o apt to believe them now, I &s;hall have a happy time with you, if I Marry you.

<P>And, without hearing him
<PB N="85" REF="46">reply, away &s;he went; tho' he pre&s;s'd her very hard, that &s;he wou'd but &s;tay, and hear him &s;peak.</P>
<P>He knew not now what to conclude on; he found his Love was too great a Ma&s;ter on him, to be ca&s;t off; for it rather increa&s;ed, than dimini&s;h|ed: And now there was no way left, but to leave it to Time.</P>
<P>He went to vi&s;it <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> who he heard was come to <HI>Paris,</HI> to pay her Du|ty at the Court; and was to return back again the next day in the Morning. She invited the Count to go and dine with
<PB N="86" REF="47">her; for there wou'd be none of the Court left in Town: For the King had invited the Queen, and the re&s;t of the Court, to go, and hunt down a Stag, that was grown Famous for his Age; and afterwards, to dine at <HI>Madrid,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the King's, about a League and half di&s;tant from <HI>Paris;</HI> which his Father, <HI>Francis the First,</HI> had built, to evade (by Equi|vocation) an Oath, that Ne|ce&s;&s;ity had oblig'd him to take. For <HI>Charles the Fifth,</HI> Emperour, and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having ta|ken him Pri&s;oner, &s;et him at Liberty, with this Condition, (be&s;ides &s;ome Ran&s;ome he paid) That he &s;hould vi&s;it <HI>Ma|drid</HI> (which is the Chief Town

<P>As the Count <HI>St. Laurans,</HI> and <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> were pa&s;|&s;ing thro' the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Wood, that is called &s;o.</NOTE> <HI>Bois de Bologne,</HI> they perceiv'd at a di&s;tance a Man, and a Wo|man, walking together in a fine Path all alone, leading their Hor&s;es in their Hands. They &s;aw by their Dre&s;&s;es, that they were People of Quality; and he appear'd by the Po&s;ture of
<PB N="88" REF="48">his Body, to be &s;aying to her &s;omething above common Di&s;|cour&s;e: But when, drawing nearer, they perceiv'd it was <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers,</HI> it pierc'd them like Daggers to their Hearts.</P>
<P>The King, and all the Court were rode on before, in pur&s;uit of the Stagg, which had led them a mo&s;t toil&s;ome Chace; in&s;omuch that tho&s;e Ladies, who not being us'd to Hunt, cou'd not indure the Fatigue of the Day, were forc'd to &s;tay, till the Coaches that were be|hind came up: Among&s;t which was <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers,</HI> who was &s;o weary &s;he cou'd &s;it no longer on Hor&s;eback;
<PB N="89" REF="48">and <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> to carry on his De&s;ign, fail'd not to &s;tay be|hind to wait upon her.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Count, and <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> over|took them, <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers</HI> thought to have ex|cus'd her being found &s;o a|lone with <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> by telling the Rea&s;on of it; which the o|thers took only for an Excu&s;e. As for <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> &s;he kept her Countenance firm: But for the Count, (who had not the power to hide the lea&s;t thing, that troubled him; but it appear'd as lively in his Face, as if he told it) he look'd with all the Marks of Anger and De|&s;pair; and immediately the
<PB N="90" REF="49">Coaches coming up, <HI>Mademoi|&s;elle de Poictiers</HI> got in, and <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> upon his Hor&s;e; &s;o, taking their Leaves, follow'd the Court.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de St. Laurans,</HI> and <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> kept on their way; but with &s;o &s;trange an increa&s;e of Torment, that it even border'd upon Di|&s;traction.</P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> now began to &s;u&s;|pect, that he was &s;till in the wrong; and that the Cour&s;e he was taking, was but making his Condition wor&s;e, by the E|venne&s;s that he perceiv'd in <HI>Ma|dame de St. Maure</HI>'s Counte|nance. Be&s;ides, he con&s;ider'd,

<P>The Expedient that pleas'd him be&s;t, was once more to &s;eek an Opportunity to &s;peak to her; and to de&s;ire her, to tell him, as a Woman of Ho|nour, If &s;he had the lea&s;t Thought for him, that cou'd tend to his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He lo&s;t no time; but that

But when one con&s;iders the Ex|travagancy of the Underta|king, one may ju&s;tly judge, he knew not what he thought. But however, Fortune &s;o far helpt him, that it became the mo&s;t lucky of all his De&s;igns; and this la&s;t ra&s;h Stroak fini&s;h|ed his Work: Like to that

<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> was too much fir'd with what he had heard, to remain unob&s;erv'd any longer: But with all the Eagerne&s;s of a Man, that was drawn from the lowe&s;t Ebb of De&s;pair, to the Top of all his Hopes, threw him&s;elf at her Feet. <HI>Ah, Ma|dame!</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>be milder in your Opinion of one, that more than dies for love of you: And don't believe, that he can doat on Tra&s;h, when there is &s;o much Excellence as your &s;elf, for to at|tract his Love.</HI></P>
<PB N="79" REF="52">
<P>She &s;tarted up, and with a Face full of Confu&s;ion, and as much of Anger, as Love wou'd give her leave, reply|ed:</P>
<P><HI>Though you have, by a ba&s;e Intru&s;ion, heard me confe&s;s I Love; yet you &s;hall have no o|ther Advantage from it, but that it &s;hall prove my Cure; for from this time, I will never &s;peak to you more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> who only de&s;ired her to hear him, kneel'd down in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner that cou'd be: To which (in|&s;en&s;ibly over-come) &s;he con|&s;ented; which was the fir&s;t Ground her Love got upon
<PB N="98" REF="53">her Honour; and in tho&s;e Fights he &s;eldom gets the lea&s;t Advantage, but he quickly beats the Other quite out of the Field.</P>
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>that I have loved you ever &s;ince I &s;aw you, Heaven, and St.</HI> Laurans <HI>can bear me witne&s;s; and with a Flame &s;o tender of your Ho|nour, that I ne'r told it to any but him, in whom I knew I might confide; and, not inten|ding to have reveal'd it even to your &s;elf, I kept the &s;welling Pa&s;&s;ion labouring in my Bo&s;ome, till it quite de&s;troy'd my Rea|&s;on: Then having lost that chief Director of my Actions, I pre|&s;um'd to tell you of my Love,
<PB N="99" REF="53">when cruelly you turn'd away, denying (as I thought) my Words the least Acce&s;&s;ion to your Soul, as if they came to violate that Beauteous Shrine. Then again to your Ears I offer'd my &V;n|happy Love, when you doom'd me to name it no more, or for ever lo&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ing of your Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then (di&s;tracted in my Thoughts) I went, and fain'd a Pa&s;&s;ion for</HI> Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers; <HI>which I thought, if you had the lea&s;t tender Remem|brance of me, wou'd kindle it into Love: But when I &s;aw, that all this was no Advantage to my Flame, by the Indifference that I read in your Looks the o|ther day; I then, thrown down

<P>As &s;oon as he had &s;poke, &s;he threw her &s;elf back in her Chair; where &s;he lay for a little while, without &s;peak|ing: At length, &s;he cry'd out:</P>
<P><HI>Oh Honour! Oh Love! How do ye divide my Soul!</HI></P>
<PB N="101" REF="54">
<P>There &s;he lay for &s;ome time weeping, and &s;ighing; by which &s;he &s;hew'd the Combate of her Mind.</P>
<P>Then afterward getting up, with a Voice more calm, &s;he &s;aid:</P>
<P><HI>Be witne&s;s, this Flood of Tears, how &s;trongly my Honour argues in the Right of Duty: But Love does plead &s;o power|fully for Thee,</HI> Cha&s;tillon, <HI>that I mu&s;t own it to Thee; which thou &s;hould'&s;t ne'r have known, had&s;t thou not thus pre&s;s'd into my &s;ecret Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>He leapt up; and ki&s;&s;ing her Hand, reply'd:</P>
<PB N="102" REF="55">
<P><HI>Tho&s;e who are Mighty in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and are Ma&s;ters of all their Wi&s;hes, are poor in Happine&s;s, compared to me. When I hear you &s;ay,</HI> You Love, <HI>I am &s;o Tran&s;ported, methinks I have already left my Natural Du&s;t behind me, and am in Hea|ven.</HI></P>
<P>She &s;eeing him in &s;uch an Exta&s;ie of Joy, &s;aid:</P>
<P><HI>Moderate your &s;elf,</HI> Cha&s;til|lon, <HI>and keep your Pa&s;&s;ion with|in the Rules of Vertue, and I will &s;till permit it; for know, that I am Married; and I will rather die, than intrench one &s;tep farther on my Duty.</HI></P>
<PB N="103" REF="55">
<P><HI>Ah, Madame!</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>pardon the Extravagance of my Love; which as yet having known no Dwelling, but the dark Re|ce&s;&s;es of De&s;pair, at the Ap|proach of Glorious Happine&s;s, is dazled, and knows not what it does. But, Madame, fear not; for I will be more careful of your Honour, than I am of my own Life.</HI></P>
<P>Then after a thou&s;and Marks of Love, and Joy, &s;he &s;aid to him:</P>
<P><HI>St.</HI> Laurans, <HI>who knew of both our Loves, (for I al&s;o told him mine) di&s;creetly, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to break off what he perceiv'd mov'd &s;o fa&s;t to both our Di&s;|advantages, was unfaithful in
<PB N="104" REF="56">this, though otherwi&s;e the be&s;t of Friends: For he told me, You to his Knowledge loved another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oh Heavens!</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>and he told me, That you to his cer|tain knowledge Loved not me.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s reply'd: <HI>He thought by a little Pain to have cured us both: But, Alas! he finds, by &s;ad Experience, that Jealou&s;ie won't cure Love; for he parted ju&s;t now from hence the most unhappy of Men: For &s;eeing you to day alone with</HI> Mademoi&s;elle de Poicti|ers, &mdash;</P>
<PB N="105" REF="56">
<P><HI>Does he then admire her,</HI> &s;aid he?</P>
<P><HI>Yes</HI> (reply'd the Counte&s;s); <HI>but he told me, He dur&s;t not tell his Love to you; for he was too much a&s;ham'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I wonder'd</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>what made him &s;o kind, to be &s;o of|ten at his Si&s;ters? But now I find the Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dear</HI> Cha&s;tillon, (&s;aid &s;he, interrupting him) <HI>though it be pain in me to de&s;ire it, yet I mu&s;t beg of you to leave me, and let not our Indi&s;cretion make us again &V;nhappy.</HI></P>
<PB N="106" REF="57">
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I obey you, and return &s;o ble&s;s'd above my Expectation, that as yet it &s;eems but a Vi&s;ion to me. Let me wait upon you to morrow, to confirm me it is true.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You may come, and dine with me,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>and bring St.</HI> Laurans <HI>with you; and I will contrive to have</HI> Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers.</P>
<P><HI>Then, Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I will freely own to her, that all my Pa&s;&s;ion was but feign'd; and &s;o we will leave St.</HI> Laurans, <HI>and Her, to agree it together.</HI></P>
<PB N="107" REF="57">
<P>Then after many Expre&s;&s;i|ons of Love, much fuller of di&s;tracted Pa&s;&s;ion, than of Sen&s;e, they parted: She went into her Chamber, where we will leave her, though not without many Conflicts in her Mind; un&s;atisfy'd with what &s;he had done, and yet pleas'd that &s;he had done it.</P>
<P>He return'd back to <HI>Paris;</HI> and the fir&s;t thing he did, he went to find out St. <HI>Laurans,</HI> who received him with an unwonted Coldne&s;s: He knew well enough the Rea&s;on; however he pre&s;s'd him to tell him, what it was that &s;ate &s;o heavy upon his Mind, and &s;eem|ed to direct at him?</P>
<PB N="108" REF="58">
<P>The Count an&s;wer'd him: <HI>You will not wonder at it, when I &s;hall tell you, That I am not only &s;o unhappy, as to be faln into the Snares of Love; but that you (my Friend) are, fince you chang'd your Love, become my Rival.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> &s;mil'd, and &s;aid to him: <HI>Think but how much it is below the free and noble Nature of a Man, to be &s;ubject to the Weakne&s;s of a Woman; and then ca&s;t her from thee.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Count,</HI> remembering this was the Advice that he had gi|ven him before, &s;aid: <HI>'Tis true, I knew not Love, when I gave thee this Advice.</HI></P>
<PB N="109" REF="58">
<P><HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> wou'd not keep him any longer in &s;u&s;pence, but unfolded all the My&s;tery to him; and withal, told him of his Succe&s;s with <HI>Madame de St. Maure;</HI> and accus'd him &s;evere|ly of his fal&s;e Dealing: Which he excus'd by the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons, that <HI>Madame de St. Maure</HI> had alleadg'd before; and pro|mis'd to go with him to Mor|row, to excu&s;e him&s;elf al&s;o to her.</P>
<P>So <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> left him, and went home to Bed. But the <HI>Count</HI> was not in the lea&s;t more &s;atisfy'd; for the Di&s;turbance of his Mind did not &s;o much a|ri&s;e from <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI>'s Loving her, as the belief he had, that
<PB N="110" REF="59">&s;he Lov'd him; which was not at all remov'd by what had been told him. But his Love being &s;o far from cur'd, that it &s;till in|creas'd, he re&s;olv'd (in &s;pight of her Unkindne&s;s) to try his Fate once more; believing, that <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI>'s leaving of her, might turn the Current of her Love on him.</P>
<P>Therefore he re&s;olv'd to take the fir&s;t Opportunity to renew his Addre&s;&s;es to her; which he unexpectedly found the next Day, (for <HI>Cha&s;tillon</HI> had told him nothing of her being there) while <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> and the Coun|te&s;s were minding their own Affairs. <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poicti|ers,</HI> who now found how things
<PB N="111" REF="59">&s;tood between <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> and her, (for he had freely con|fe&s;s'd the Cheat he had put up|on her) and finding that now there was no more hopes of him, receiv'd <HI>St. Laurans</HI>'s Love; and was intru&s;ted with the Se|cret of the Love there was be|tween <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> and the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>St. Maure.</HI></P>
<P>From this time, tho' &s;he was Coquette to the la&s;t Degree, and even Incon&s;tant beyond her Sex; yet for a great while, &s;he lov'd the Count <HI>St. Laurans</HI> with a violent Flame.</P>
<P>Thus they became each o|thers Confidents, and as kind In&s;truments to promote each o|thers
<PB N="112" REF="60">Love. But, Alas! there wanted &s;omething yet to make this Union firm; for <HI>Made|moi&s;elle de Poictiers</HI> retain'd &s;till too much of her Old Hu|mour, to enter into the Bonds of perfect Love: She &s;till re|ceiv'd the Court&s;hip of all tho&s;e who wou'd make it to her; and wou'd be pleas'd with the Admiration of all the contem|ned Fops of the Court; the pert, in&s;ipid, talking, dancing, dre&s;&s;ing Fools, who doated up|on any thing wou'd give them leave, were all welcom to her, and always about her: Which made the Count <HI>St. Laurans</HI> &s;o unea&s;ie, that he began to think, that unle&s;s &s;he wou'd change her &s;elf in this, it wou'd be
<PB N="113" REF="60">the be&s;t for him to try once more, if he could de&s;i&s;t from loving of her; for &s;till he thought, that Love and Hate were in his Power, when he was ab&s;ent from her. But her &s;ight &s;oon convinc'd him of his Er|rour: Be&s;ides, he had now greater Hopes than ever; it growing &s;o in&s;upportable to him, to hear every where tho&s;e Creatures boa&s;ting of her Fa|vours. So one time he came to her, and freely told her, how prodigal &s;he had been of her Graces; in&s;omuch, that it grew a great torment to him, to hear &s;o many bragging of her kind Returns to their Services. At which &s;he grew into a violent Anger; and told him, <HI>That &s;he
<PB N="114" REF="61">had declared to him before, that tho' &s;he permitted him to Love her, yet &s;he wou'd never make him Ma&s;ter of her Actions.</HI></P>
<P>That Reply rais'd the <HI>Count's</HI> Anger &s;o much above his Love, that he &s;wore, <HI>&V;nle&s;s &s;he wou'd quit that Humour, he wou'd ne|ver &s;peak to her more:</HI> And &s;he, flinging away with a contem|ning Laugh, bad him keep his Word, if he cou'd.</P>
<P>This Carriage of hers had rais'd him into &s;uch a Fury, that he took &s;o &s;trong a Re&s;o|lution, that for five Weeks he kept his Word. In all which time, when ere they met, they &s;aluted each other with &s;uch a
<PB N="115" REF="61">&s;ad Formality, as if they were pa&s;&s;ing by to go contrary ways to Execution. By this time &s;he began to &s;often, and wou'd have &s;ubmitted to any thing, but Speaking to him fir&s;t. And to pa&s;s over that, &s;he had no way but to pretend to <HI>Madame de St. Maure,</HI> (who &s;he knew, wou'd tell the <HI>Count</HI> again) that he, &s;ince their falling out, had ungenerou&s;ly &s;poken ba&s;ely of her. This &s;he believ'd wou'd bring the <HI>Count</HI> to vindicate him&s;elf; and &s;o they might make up all again. Which De|&s;ign took to her Wi&s;h; for in few days, the Court going to <HI>St. Cloud,</HI> where the <HI>Count</HI> and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poictiers</HI> went too with the <HI>Daulphine-Queen,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="62">he went one day to <HI>Paris,</HI> to vi&s;it &s;ome Friends of his; and returning in the Evening back again, he walk'd very thought|fully along tho&s;e Walks, that borders upon the River, where he found <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poi|ctiers</HI> all alone, having &s;lipt a|way from the other Maids that were walking above. As &s;oon as &s;he perceiv'd he &s;aw her, &s;he pretended to &s;hun him; but he &s;eeing it, went &s;traight up to her: <HI>Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I did not think you wou'd have held &s;o injurious an Opinion of me, as to think, that I can rail at you, whom I love above my Life.</HI></P>
<P>She turn'd about ha&s;tily, and darting from her Eyes Rage
<PB N="117" REF="62">(in&s;tead of Love) at him, brake out into the&s;e words: <HI>Traitour, ba&s;e, inhuman Man, &s;hame of thy Sex, and Cur&s;e to me, who love thee! Think, how you drew me to it by a thou&s;and Oaths and Promi&s;es, which (in a moment) for one ra&s;h Word, you have broke! By your delu&s;ive Arts, you led me to a high and &s;lippery Precipice, then left me alone to fall head-long into my Grave. Now con&s;ider thy own Ingrati|tude, then blu&s;h to look upon me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madame,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>'tis only for tho&s;e who are Guilty, to blu&s;h; but for me, who prote&s;t my &s;elf innocent of any thing either &s;po|ken, or thought against you: I can only tell you, That your In|formations
<PB N="118" REF="63">have been all mo&s;t no|toriou&s;ly fal&s;e: And to &s;hew, that what I &s;ay is true, here I &s;wear and vow, never to love any but your &s;elf, if you will only conde|&s;cend to my last Reque&s;t:</HI> Which &s;he (after much railing at his Ingratitude) yielded to; and withal, gave him much greater marks of her Love, than &s;he had ever done before.</P>
<P>She went &s;traight that night, and &s;upp'd with <HI>Madam de St. Maure,</HI> to whom &s;he told all that had pa&s;s'd; at which &s;he extreamly rejoyc'd; for &s;he had been in great pain, le&s;t the Breach between them, might be a means to publi&s;h her Love to <HI>Cha&s;tillon.</HI></P>
<PB N="119" REF="63">
<P>They liv'd thus, and injoy|ed (for a great while undi|&s;turb'd) the Sweets of Love; and, as they thought, unob|&s;erv'd: But the continual fan|ta&s;tical Quarrels, that happen'd between the Count <HI>de St. Lau|rans,</HI> and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poi|ctiers,</HI> were cau&s;es of much Unhappine&s;s to them all after|wards; for they gave occa&s;ion to the World to &s;earch deeper into their Actions; and &s;o to perceive the Kindne&s;s, that there was between <HI>Cha&s;tillon,</HI> and the Counte&s;s <HI>de St. Maure.</HI> For many People had been en|deavouring to plumb the bot|tom of both the Count <HI>St. Lau|ran's,</HI> and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Poi|ctier's</HI>
