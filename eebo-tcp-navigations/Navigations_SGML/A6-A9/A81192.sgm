<HEAD>The <HI>Curry-Comb</HI> turn'd to its <HI>RIGHT USE;</HI> Or, The <HI>Powder-Monkey</HI> to a <HI>Jamaica Ship,</HI> Dre&s;s'd with it.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By the Author of the Trip to <HI>Holland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fiery <HI>Plantation Author</HI> perhaps may be angry, that I liken him to &s;o little an Animal as a Monkey in the Title, when in his <HI>Tower-hill</HI> Simile he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the mighty Image of a true bred Ma&s;tiff; tho' where his <HI>Breeding</HI> is I can't tell; for I under&s;tand at the Derby Ale-hou&s;e that his Friends never bred him a Scholar, but where his want of it appears may be ea&s;ily di&s;cernable, even by our Au|thor, who has none.</P>
<P>The way to give him no further provocation is to An&s;wer him in La|tin, and then your &s;ure not to be under&s;tood, unle&s;s he happily lights on <HI>Tom. Brown</HI> to expound it to him, and the way to provoke him is much more difficult to be found, if our Champion plea&s;es to remember who 'twas challeng'd him before his Printer, and could get nothing more from him then that he liv'd at <HI>I&s;lington;</HI> And this is an in&s;tance of his <HI>Courage, Contempt,</HI> and <HI>holding up his Leg,</HI> and <HI>&s;cornfully pi&s;&s;ing upon his trembling A&s;&s;ailant;</HI> &s;o it is an Evident Sign our Dealer in <HI>Similitudes,</HI> after he was not &s;uffer'd to be one in <HI>Sugar,</HI> is as far from having any ju&s;t claim to the u&s;e of a Cudgel for his Talent, as he has to the u&s;e of a Pen.</P>
<P>But our Author is eager for doing the World Ju&s;tice, and the <HI>Un|mannerly &s;auce-box</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;cover'd, who dar'd yelp at the Heels of this <HI>Di&s;dainful Bull-dog.</HI> I warrant you he thinks he de&s;erves as much at lea&s;t as Dr. <HI>Oates</HI> for the <HI>Di&s;covery of his Horrid Plot</HI> again&s;t the Pur&s;es of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects. A Book&s;eller in <HI>Fleet&s;treet</HI> &s;hew'd him <HI>Feltham</HI>'s Re|&s;olves, pointed out the place to him, and with much ado, he Read it.</P>
<P>O <HI>Mon&s;trum Horrendum!</HI> Here is a Plagiari&s;m in Perfection, a whole Sheet and an half &s;tolen, and not fall under the Cen&s;ure of &s;ome Magi|&s;trate for it. But the&s;e two Words of Latin has &s;ent him in the &s;earch of &s;ome Interpreter to give him the Engli&s;h of them. And now in his ab&s;ence, I mu&s;t do my &s;elf and the Book&s;eller the &s;ame Ju&s;tice he pre|tends to do to the World.</P>
<P>A Gentleman brought a &s;mall Pamphlet in 12's to my Book&s;eller, Entitul'd <HI>Batavia, or the Hollanders di&s;play'd,</HI> but no Author, or Book&s;eller's Name to it, but only Printed in the Year 1697. This he told him he brought from <HI>Holland,</HI> and advis'd him to Print it, as being full of pretty delightful Remarks. Accordingly it was brought me, and after adding two Sheets and an half to it, we agreed to call it a <HI>Trip to Holland,</HI> be|cau&s;e a certain &s;currilous non&s;en&s;ical Pamphlet had &s;old well under the Name of a Trip. This, upon the Word of a Gentleman, a Title, to which our <HI>Curry-Comber</HI> has no Plea, is the real Truth, and we were led on in this ignorance, till the Day or two before it was publi&s;hed, when it was too late, to recall a De&s;ign, the Book&s;eller had been at too great a charge, and trouble in carrying on, to lo&s;e the Publication of.</P>
<P>He is &s;orry for the Man who deals in Books, and I am &s;orry for him who pretends to write them; but I am &s;ure the la&s;t does not de&s;erve the Pity which the fir&s;t is above. <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &s;hould be the Ingre|dients of a good <HI>Poet;</HI> but how he comes to make this applicable to a Man who improves in his Trade, is Reputable among&s;t his Neighbours, and is e&s;teem'd as a Companion for better Gentlemen than the <HI>Jamaica</HI>-Author, or his ignorant Printer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word">, I cannot tell, unle&s;s the bu&s;ie <HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI> Book-&s;eller told him.</P>
<P>As he has de&s;crib'd me to be a Little, Shallow-brain'd Fellow, &s;o it will not be out of the way to give a De&s;cription of him. To begin
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">therefore with his Face; It is Ru&s;&s;et-colour'd, with Pock-holes in it; and as that is &s;omewhat broader than ordinary, &s;o his Skull, who&s;e Em|ptine&s;s is the only Argument of a <HI>Vacuum</HI> in Nature, is proportionable. His Body is a long Ox's Bladder, blown up with the Wind of <HI>Derby</HI>-Ale: His Legs too have partaken of the &s;ame <HI>Flatus;</HI> and he looks like a Man who Cudgels People as much as he talks of it. For his Apparel, it all came out of one Shop: No one has the Impudence to call his Wigg a Second-handed one, for it was the Ca&s;t-off of &s;ome <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> and he had it from his Ma&s;ter, the Broker from him, and he from the Bro|ker. The Sword was &s;ome disbanded Trooper's, a &s;winging one, which was pawn'd for a Shilling, and &s;o our Author had a Bargain in it in buying it for Two. His Cravat and Ruffles, for I mu&s;t tell you, when he came to Bully me, he had Hand-Cuffs, look'd as if they had the Yellow-Jaun|dice, and yawn'd at as many Holes as his own <HI>Jamaica</HI> did when it had an Earth-quake, which he calls <HI>the Dry Belly-Ach.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Fancy</HI> is not <HI>Mu&s;hroon,</HI> as he calls mine, which grows up to Perfe|ction in one Night; but he mu&s;t have two Days and a Night to &s;poil what another would have perfected in half an Hour, el&s;e he would ne|ver have &s;pent <HI>Saturday, Sunday,</HI> and the Night following, on &s;o trifling an Half-&s;heet as his <HI>Trip to</HI> Holland <HI>Detected.</HI></P>
<P>As for his being a Tran&s;ported Felon, I &s;hall not concern my &s;elf who incerted it, tho' he is &s;o po&s;itive in his Man: Ev'n let it be as he thinks, for I &s;hould lo&s;e more than his Satisfaction would make me Amends for, &s;hould I take the pains to inform him.</P>
<P>And for his pretending to in&s;inuate to the World, that I call'd my Book&s;eller <HI>the Ignorant PUPPY, my Chap,</HI> I &s;hould do well to lay the Ig|norance at his own Door, who&s;e Brain is &s;o &s;hallow as not to fathom the Meaning of it. For once therefore, to hold a Light to his Under&s;tand|ing, which is <HI>hid under the Bu&s;hel, his Skull,</HI> for I told you before the Di|men&s;ions of it, I declare, I have more Re&s;pect for my Book-&s;eller, than to load him with any &s;uch Character; and I de&s;ire him, who was one of the Readers, to take it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His la&s;t Paragraph but one, has Occa&s;ion for a more &s;erious An&s;wer. Here he would fa&s;ten a Crime upon me, which I declare, in the Pre&s;ence of God, I know nothing of, directly, or indirectly; and know no more of what he means by his ambiguous &s;peaking of a Silver Tankard, than he did my Sen&s;e when I &s;aid <HI>the Puppy, my Chap.</HI> Indeed, I have &s;old ma|ny Books, and cannot but think he had done me more Ju&s;tice, had he &s;aid, my Family (which he owns to be that of a Gentleman) had been di&s;grac'd by their with-holding Money from me, not by my &s;elling of Books. And, for writing <HI>Ob&s;cene Ballads, Bloody Murthers,</HI> and <HI>La&s;t Dy|ing Speeches,</HI> he cannot but remember where the Reflection lies, &s;ince he was <HI>W</HI>&mdash; the Printer's Journey-man for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Paragraph gives you the Declaration of our Exa&s;perated Bull-Dog: He tells the World, as if he were at his la&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion, he never wrote the <HI>An&s;wer to the Trip to</HI> Holland. And what of all this? He has <HI>Curry'd</HI> him&s;elf <HI>out of the World's Favaur</HI> without it, by his Pre&s;ent of the <HI>Curry-Comb.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, for the Paper will hold no more, neither the Author, or the Book-&s;eller, value the Threatnings of his <HI>Cane,</HI> or his <HI>London-Spy;</HI> but both are of the &s;ame Opinion with a great Writer at <HI>Will</HI>'s Cof|fee-hou&s;e, That <HI>now the Fool has written him&s;elf into &s;ome Reputation among&s;t the Mob, he is writing Po&s;t to get out of it again.</HI></P>
<P>&rindx; <HI>This Day is Re-printed</HI> The Trip to Holland; <HI>and may be had at mo&s;t Book&s;ellers.</HI></P>
<P>&rindx; <HI>On</HI> Thur&s;day <HI>&s;even-night will be Publi&s;h'd</HI> The London Spy taken and Executed, with his la&s;t dying Speech.</P>
