<P>_THE <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> War upon the <HI>Empire,</HI> being at pre&s;ent the Great Action of <HI>Chri|&s;tendom;</HI> and that where|upon all Mens Eyes, and thoughts are fix'd, who have any Con&s;ideration, even for <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity</HI> it &s;elf: It will perchance be a work not unacceptable, to give the World a brief Relation of the <HI>Ri&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> of the Quarrel; which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this lit|tle Treati&s;e, being a <HI>Narrative</HI> of the mo&s;t Remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages of the la&s;t <HI>Campag|nia,</HI> Written in <HI>High Dutch</HI> by an Indu|&s;trious, and Carefull Hand, and turned into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for the Satisfaction of the <HI>Engli&s;h Reader.</HI> There is likewi&s;e Order taken for a Continuation of the Story, which &s;hall come forth in its due time, be|ing Committed to the Care of diver&s;e In|telligent Per&s;ons, where the <HI>Scene</HI> lyes, to gather the <HI>Materials</HI> for it; to the End, that nothing Worthy of Ob&s;ervation

<HEAD>The <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> whereupon was grounded the Propo&s;al from his Sacred <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, to their Honorable Lord&s;hips the <HI>States General,</HI> which they may be plea|&s;ed to Weigh, and Con&s;ider.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> THat His Sacred Maje&s;ty gave no Cau&s;e for this War; but that Perpetual, and Irreconcilable Enemy to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> provoked by no Injurie; without any Colour, or Pretence of Ju&s;tice, or Hone&s;ty; In the Year <HI>1660.</HI> Seized upon <HI>Waradine,</HI> a &s;trong Ca&s;tle on the very Borders of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which he Garri&s;on'd with a great party to infe&s;t the Neighbou|ring <HI>Provinces.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="3"><HI>2.</HI> &V;pon which account, his Sacred <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, was not onely forc'd to Rai&s;e a &s;uddain Army <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> to oppo&s;e &s;o great an Enemy, but al&s;o to call for ayd from the other Princes and States of the <HI>Empire;</HI> as likewi&s;e to look out to other <HI>Chri&s;tian Kings</HI> and <HI>States,</HI> unle&s;&s;e he would have expo&s;ed the whole Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> to pre&s;ent danger, and let tho&s;e Royal Provinces of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania, Wil|lachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> be rent off from <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and En&s;lav'd to the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> When the Enemy gave &s;ome hopes of a Friendly Compo&s;ing the Bu&s;ines, his Sa|cred <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty was defective in nothing which upon hon &s;t Conditions might conduce to Peace.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> When the la&s;t Year a Treaty was be|gun between his Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, and <HI>Ati Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> Plenipotentiary from the <HI>Turk,</HI> which afterwards was by Common Con&s;ent perfected, and in Expectation of a Ratification, then began other more weigh|ty Conditions to be required, and harder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">erms, with a great deal of Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, were almo&s;t impo&s;ed upon us: And at last
<PB REF="4">having gathered a great Number of Forces together, both out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> vio|lating the Faith and Religion of all former <HI>Treaties,</HI> he brake into <HI>Hungary</HI> at the &s;ame In&s;tant, both Proclaiming, and Wa|ging War; (His Maje&s;ties <HI>Emba&s;&s;adour,</HI> contrary to the Law of Nations, detain'd by force,) was proudly, and contumeliou&s;ly u&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> 'Tis clear, this fraudulent Enemy hath taken his opportunity in a time, when his Maje&s;ties <HI>Hereditary</HI> Dominions have been exhau&s;ted by continual Wars, and other Cau&s;es; as likewi&s;e almo&s;t all other <HI>Chri|&s;tian Princes</HI> weakned, by Civil Di&s;cords among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which, his Sacred <HI>Impeiral</HI> Maje&s;ty, and his Dominions have omitted nothing, whereby they might &s;u&s;tain the burthen of &s;o great a War, by their own &s;trength, and hinder the progre&s;s of the Enemy until the A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Princes of the <HI>Empire</HI> could be ready.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> Which neither coming in time, nor with &s;o con&s;iderable a Force as was nece&s;&s;a|rily requir'd, the &s;torms &s;pread further: <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and other Cities of le&s;s Note
<PB REF="4">were &s;ubdued by the <HI>Turks; Moravia</HI> laid wast by the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> many Thou&s;and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> carried away to perpetual Captivity, The Faith and Con|&s;tancy of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> wavered; and which is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, the Ambitious Enemy took courage from his Succe&s;s; So that now he doth not onely promi&s;e him&s;elf the Kingdome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> but likewi&s;e publickly boa&s;ts, that he will &s;uddainly be Head of the <HI>We&s;tern Empire.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><HI>8.</HI> To which purpo&s;e, as we are inform'd from good hands, he intends to be in the Field the next Spring, and with a greater Force then formerly, &s;et upon his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, and the <HI>Chri&s;tian Empire,</HI> re|&s;olving to carry away with him all that he meeteth with from fourteen Years of Age to Sixty</P>
<P N="9"><HI>9.</HI> 'I is true indeed, the danger of this War doth more immediatly hang over his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty, and his Dominions, but then it is not le&s;s a truth, that all other <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes,</HI> both in General and Particular are concern'd.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>10.</HI> Not onely becau&s;e all profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> are by that Bond united into
<PB REF="5">one Body, e&s;peicall again&s;t him who equally dete&s;ts all, taking his fir&s;t Ri&s;e from the Ruines of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Kingdoms; particu|larly the <HI>Ea&s;tern Empire</HI> it &s;elf, and now de&s;ires nothing more then by propagating the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Super&s;tition, to extin|gui&s;h <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion</P>
<P N="11"><HI>11.</HI> But in another re&s;pect it is clear, that the Event of this War doth concern All, and every One, although they regard nothing but their own &s;ecurity</P>
<P N="12"><HI>12.</HI> For &s;eeing it is manife&s;t, the King|dome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and other his Maje&s;ties Dominions have been for a long time the &s;ole Bulwark of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> and no le&s;&s;e manife&s;t that, That being broke through, the re&s;t lies open to an Infinite Rab|ble of <HI>Barbarians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">; Germany</HI> being in the mid&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and joyning upon mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Kingdoms; the Con&s;equence muct needs be this; His Sacred Maje&s;ty, and the &s;trength of the <HI>Empire</HI> being once over-thrown, (which God forbid) that Cruel Enemy will lye heavy upon them all, and be equally formidable to every one of them.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>13.</HI> Neither is he only &s;o for number of
<PB REF="5">Souldiers, (which all <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes &s;hould they Mu&s;ter their Forces together, would &s;care equall) but likewi&s;e for Mili|tary Di&s;cipline; for in &s;o numerous an Army there is none, that drink Wine; are delicate in the Dyet, or in any other un|nece&s;&s;aries: none that maintain <HI>Char|riots Feuds, Women,</HI> or any &s;uch like Impediments of War: So that the <HI>Turks</HI> can with le&s;s charge maintain <HI>Three Hun|dred Thou&s;and</HI> in Armes, then any <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Prince <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and.</HI></P>
<P N="14"><HI>14.</HI> Moreover, he hath this Advantage, he never regardeth the lo&s;&s;e of his Men; the Effu&s;ion of who&s;e blood he careth not for, &s;o he may gain his de&s;ign upon tho&s;e he Warreth again&s;t; Subduing Town, and Country: the Common Souldiers them|&s;elves, out of a &s;trange Super&s;titious per|&s;wa&s;ion, voluntarily devoting their Lives to his Service, whil&s;t all <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes are in another Condition, there being no Victory &s;o great, but may be purcha&s;ed too dear by <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Blood.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>15.</HI> To the&s;e, we may add, that at this time (to the great di&s;grace of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dome</HI>) the <HI>Turk</HI> hath verynigh a perfect
<PB REF="6">Army of <HI>Chri&s;tian Rebells,</HI> and <HI>Rene|gadoes;</HI> who being formerly brought up in Warrs among&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes, by en|gaging them&s;elves to the <HI>Turk,</HI> teach them the readie&s;t way of Pitching Battles, Be|&s;ieging Towns, and ordering their Camp, heretofore not know by them.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>16.</HI> In the Common cau&s;e this is the &s;ole difference; his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje&s;ty cannot venture without &s;ome con&s;iderable danger, <HI>every wound given</HI> him (as the Proverb is) <HI>goes to the heart;</HI> but other Princes may engage without any Con&s;iderable da|mage, in re&s;pect of their power and &s;trength, &s;o that they &s;hall not partake of his Maje|&s;ties danger, but gain to them&s;elves Eternal prai&s;e and honour.</P>
<P N="17"><HI>17. Six Hundred Years</HI> agoe, and diver&s;e times &s;ince, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes undertook a <HI>Forreign</HI> Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> onely out of a de&s;ign to propagate the <HI>Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e;</HI> and the Common people Emulating their piety, Contributed thereunto voluntarily upon their own account.</P>
<P N="18"><HI>18.</HI> Neither is it probable any <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Princes have &s;o far degenerated from
<PB REF="6">the piety of their Ance&s;tors, as not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ame Cau&s;e, which is now more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e to repell, not wage a War; &s;o that that confederacy cannot but be mo&s;t accep|table to God, wherein all <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes unanimou&s;ly agree to maintain the Common Cau&s;e of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P N="19"><HI>19.</HI> The Report of this Confederacy (for Fame makes all things &s;ound at the be&s;t) may not alittle Contribute towards the War, or at lea&s;t-wayes take from the Ene|my that hope, which he hath hitherto pro|mis'd him&s;elf from the di&s;cords of <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Princes, by which means he will not be &s;o far Conceited, but dread that Power when united, which he Contemned, whil&s;t divided into Factions.</P>
<P N="20"><HI>20.</HI> However things happen, his Sacred Maje&s;ty, under the protection of Divine Providence is re&s;olv'd to venture, and Sa|crifice, both to his own, and Peoples For|tunes in defence of Him&s;elf, and the Pub|lick good.</P>
<P N="21"><HI>21.</HI> But lea&s;t he &s;hould &s;eem defective in that which was his Duty, (it being a &s;atis|faction in misfortune to have omitted no|thing, that might prevent it) he thought fit
<PB REF="7">to &s;end &s;ome of his Chief Nobility to mo&s;t Princes in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> that as well by his Entreaty, as Example, they might par|ticipate of &s;o Glorious and Enterprize.</P>
<P N="22"><HI>22.</HI> Which thing having once purpos'd, He immediately thought upon their Ho|nourable Lord&s;hips the <HI>States General,</HI> not doubting, but that their Prudence, and Acquaintance with &s;uch Affairs will give an an&s;wer that may be an Example to other Princes, and let them under&s;tand that a Common danger, is to be Engaged again&s;t by a Common Charge and Councell, hoping they will give &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance as &s;hall be agreeable to the greatne&s;s of the danger, the Dignity which they bear among&s;t other <HI>Chri&s;tian States;</HI> the Publick and Pri|vate Wealth of tho&s;e <HI>Provinces</HI> they com|mand and that Glory which hath accru'd to them both in Peace, and War; and la&s;tly to the True, and &s;incere Friend&s;hip which hath alwayes been between them, and the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI></P>
<P N="23"><HI>23.</HI> E&s;pecially when they well know there &s;eldome occurrs Matter for &s;o much Virtue and Prai&s;e, and therefore his Ma|je&s;ty doth ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf that upon
<PB REF="7">their own accord they would engage in&s;o Holy a War, and not &s;uffer the <HI>Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e</HI> to be Over-thrown, or &s;tand &s;till whil&s;t others reap the Glory.</P>
<P N="24"><HI>24.</HI> One thing more mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that the Greate&s;t Concern in the Affaire, Con&s;i&s;ts in the Expedition, which as it Commends all Courte&s;ies; &s;o it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to this that his Maje&s;ty may have &s;ufficient time to anticipate the Councel of his Enemies.</P>
<P N="25"><HI>25.</HI> But above all things, this mu&s;t be taken notice of <HI>(viz.)</HI> how much it concerns all men that will bear part in &s;o Pious a work, that this Year, or as &s;oon as can be, the War be undertaken, that &s;o the Enemy being fru&s;trated of his de&s;ign of overcoming <HI>Hungary,</HI> and Subverting the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> may be willing to Embrace an ho|ne&s;t Peace, which is a happine&s;s his Maje&s;ty cannot promi&s;e him&s;elf, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted from other <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes;</HI> all being little enough, either to obtain the Victory, or con|tinue the War.</P>
<P N="26"><HI>26.</HI> But the War being prolonged for &s;ome Years, the whole Strength of the <HI>Em|pire</HI> will be con&s;um'd, and by Con&s;equence
<PB REF="8">a greater nece&s;&s;ity of requiring <HI>Forreign</HI> Ayd, which in &s;o mi&s;erable a Condition cannot be denyed, by tho&s;e that regard their own &s;ecurity; &s;o that we may &s;ay, how much the le&s;s <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes</HI> contribute this Summer to the War; &s;o much the more will they be fore't to give for the Future, neither then will it conduce &s;o much to their prai&s;e, becau&s;e requi&s;ite to their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="27"><HI>27.</HI> This is all his Maje&s;ty thought fit to Enform their Lord&s;hips of, though he might have added much more, but cho&s;e rather to omit it, least he &s;hould &s;eem to doubt their Lord&s;hips willingne&s;s to Embrace &s;o Noble a <HI>Specimen</HI> of a pious and generous a &s;pirit, as it mu&s;t needs be to ayd a di&s;tre&s;s'd Friend.</P>
<P N="28"><HI>28.</HI> As for the form and mannerof &s;end|ing the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is very rea&s;onable the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be left to the prudence and di&s;cretion of their Lord&s;hips; unle&s;s it may be thought expedient, that their Lord|&s;hips Commi&s;&s;ioners, together with the un|derwritten <HI>Envoy&eacute; Extra;</HI> from his <HI>Im|perial Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;hould Examine, by what meanes the Bu&s;ine&s;s may be be&s;t perform'd, for the Publick Good, and lea&s;t to their lo&s;s and dammage.</P>

<P>THe Providence of God did never more &s;ignally appear then <HI>Ye&s;terday,</HI> in the pre&s;ervati|on not onely of my &s;elf, and the Forces uner my Command, but likewi&s;e of all the Neighbouring Countries hereabouts: At which time the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> with a mighty Power, and in the open day, advanced toward us, bring|ing with them an orderly well-framed <HI>Ship-Bridge,</HI> with all
<PB N="89" REF="53">things appertaining thereunto; and two thou&s;and <HI>Tartars</HI> were &s;ent before, to lay it, and make it ready for the re&s;t of the Forces. The little &s;trength I had, I di&s;po|&s;ed here, and there, as I thought mo&s;t for my advantage, and kept Guard my &s;elf with three Hun|dred Hor&s;e. About break of day, notice was given me by a <HI>Warn|ing-Piece,</HI> of the Infidels ap|proach: Whereupon I in&s;tantly moved into &s;ight, and found that two thou&s;and of the Enemy were already over the water; our con|dition was now de&s;perate, it being neither po&s;&s;ible for me to make a faire Retreat, nor indeed advi&s;e|able to think of one; in this &s;treight we took up a re&s;olution, and Char|ged into the middle of their Body, where we were wholly encompa&s;|&s;ed; but God Almighty, out of

In fine, the face of the River was quite covered with Hor&s;e and Men; and of this op|portunity, I made what u&s;e I could, taking not &s;o much as one Pri&s;oner; &s;o that betwixt killing and drowning, not many of them e&s;caped: Above a thou&s;and of
