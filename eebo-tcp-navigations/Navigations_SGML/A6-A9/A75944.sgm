<P>SO &s;o! we are like to have warm work on't e'faith; this late Scene of Mirth and Joy for our new King and Queen may probably prove like the la&s;t blaze of a Candle &s;pent in the &s;ocket: Young <HI>Philodemus</HI> they &s;ay is Landed in the We&s;t with a tru&s;ty Troop of <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> and &s;ets up for the Chri&s;tian Religion: Ha, ha, this Religion is the mo&s;t quarrel|&s;ome thing in the World. There has not been a War in <HI>Europe</HI> this many Ages, but Religion &s;till came in for a &s;hare; and Hea|ven knows, they that make mo&s;t pother about it have commonly lea&s;t to do with it: Well, what the event may be I cannot di|vine; but it is certain, this young Prince carries a great &s;troke in the Peoples Hearts, though in reality, he is but Na|tural Son to the late King; and has no more right to the Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> than I have to be King of <HI>Poland;</HI> however this good may come of his Enterprize, that if he e&s;capes, though he be vanqui&s;hed, he'll &s;erve for a bridle to the exorbitant humour of our haughty ill-de&s;igning Queen, and to correct the weak|ne&s;s of an ob&s;tinate bigotted King. I have heard part of her de|&s;igns; and how to advance the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion in <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;he would not &s;cruple to expo&s;e her Husbands Honour, her own Cha&s;tity, or the Kingdoms Welfare and Peace; but let her drive on, I have a re&s;erve in &s;tore for her, that will make her Minions &s;cratch, her &s;elf chafe, and <HI>Cullidada</HI> tremble; that will make him turn his tune of Obedience without <HI>Re&s;erve,</HI> and be
<PB N="20" REF="13">glad if his People will then take their own again and be quiet: But &s;tay, here he comes with his <HI>Pious</HI> Chancellor and Con|fe&s;&s;or; he has Fire in his Eyes, and &s;ullen Rage in his Face; he has heard of <HI>Monumora</HI>'s Landing: I'll hu&s;h, up in a corner, and hear their Conference.</P>

His people &s;et him up, though excluded by Law, and cho&s;e rather to be guided by their love to his Family, than by the rea&s;onable Rules of even nece&s;&s;ary Politicks; they generou&s;ly fixed all their thoughts on the King, and never di&s;|puted the Errours of the <HI>Pagan;</HI> and how well they are likely to be paid for their kindne&s;s, the <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Pietro</HI> have too late|ly declared.
