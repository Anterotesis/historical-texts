<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
OF THE
French Publi&s;her.</HEAD>
<P>THO the &s;urpri&s;ing Adventures
of Mr. <HI>Sadeur,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;|covery</HI>
of the Country of which
you are going to read the parti|culars,
be things very <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> yet
'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, the Reader will not much
&s;cruple to believe them, when he &s;hall be
informed, that a <HI>Southern unknown
Land</HI> has been talkt of the&s;e 200 Years&punc;
He will only wonder, that &s;ince the world
is now &s;o well furni&s;hed with numbers of
&s;uch skillful and curious Travellers, how it
&s;hould have continued &s;o long <HI>undi&s;cover'd,</HI>
and he will judge not without &s;ufficient
Grounds, that they which have attempted
<PB REF="3">
this di&s;covery, have either been <HI>Lo&s;t in
their Voyage,</HI> or been Killed by the In|habitants
of the Country, after they had
entred it; as <HI>Sadeur</HI> had been him&s;elf, had
it not been for the &s;ignal he gave of a prodi|gious
Bravery and Courage, before the eyes
of the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> by fighting again&s;t ani|mals
of a mon&s;trous &s;trength and bigne&s;s;
which &s;o charmed tho&s;e people, who are na|turally
very brave them&s;elves, that they
granted him the priviledge to live among
them, contrary to the mo&s;t &s;olemn Laws of
their Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Birth of Sadeur,</HI> and his Education,
his Misfortunes and <HI>Shipwracks,</HI> will ap|pear
to all the World, as effects of a De&s;ti|ny,
that de&s;igned him to be born for no o|ther
purpo&s;e, but to be conducted afterward
into that <HI>unknown Country,</HI> of which we
had no <HI>true Relation</HI> before his time.</P>
<P>It is true, that <HI>Magellan</HI> attributed to
him&s;elf the honour of having di&s;covered this
Country, in the year 1520, under the name
of <HI>Terra de Fugo,</HI> or the <HI>Land of Five.</HI>
But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have clearly convinced
us, that he di&s;covered certain I&s;lands that
depend rather upon <HI>America,</HI> than <HI>Au|&s;tralia.
Mark Paul</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> has like|wi&s;e
enjoyed for a con&s;iderable time the
<HI>Glory of this Di&s;covery,</HI> becau&s;e that
<PB REF="3">
being driven by a Tempe&s;t, a great way be|yond
the I&s;land of <HI>Java,</HI> he di&s;covered the
Kingdom of <HI>Maletur,</HI> the Province of
<HI>Beach,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Petau;</HI> and another
I&s;le, which he named, the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Java:</HI>
But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> which have &s;ince &s;et|tled
them&s;elves in the <HI>Greater Java;</HI> and
who drive all the Commerce there, a&s;&s;ure us
by all their <HI>Relations,</HI> that all the Coun|tries
that Pilot &s;aw, are nothing but a great
clu&s;ter of many I&s;lands, that no where joyn
to the <HI>Southern Continent:</HI> and that is &s;o
much the more probable, becau&s;e <HI>Ferdinan|do
Galego,</HI> having Roved all about that
Great Sea, from the Strait of <HI>Magellan,</HI>
to the Molucca I&s;lands, reports that it is
&s;towed with &s;uch a multitude of I&s;lands,
that he counted above a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e true, that upon comparing
the De&s;cription that <HI>Ferdinando de Quir</HI>
a <HI>Portugal,</HI> gives of the <HI>Southern Conti|nent,</HI>
with that which is contained in this
Book, it mu&s;t needs be allowed, that he
hath made &s;ome Di&s;covery of that Country.
For we read in his eighth <HI>Reque&s;t</HI> to the
<HI>King of Spain,</HI> that in the Di&s;coveries,
which he made in the year 1610, of the
Southern Country, called here <HI>Au&s;tralia,</HI>
he found a Country much more Fertile and
Populous than any in <HI>Europe;</HI> that the in|habitants
<PB REF="4">
were much Biger and Taller than
the <HI>Europeans;</HI> and that they lived much
longer than they. And <HI>Lewis Paes de
Morres,</HI> who was Admiral of the Fleet of
the &s;aid <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> confirmed to the
Councel of <HI>Spain,</HI> the truth of <HI>Doaduir's</HI>
Relation, adding that the Air was &s;o heal|thy
in that Country, and &s;o conformable to
the Temper of Man, that people there, as
freely &s;lept by <HI>Moon-light,</HI> as by Day-light,
on the bare Earth, and that not only
without any incommodity, but with plea&s;ure;
That the Fruits there were &s;o excellent and
nouri&s;hing, that the inhabitants &s;ought no
other food; that they drank a much more
plea&s;tant Liquor than Wine, that they knew
not the u&s;e of Cloaths; and that the &s;tudy
of <HI>Natural Knowledge,</HI> was there very
much Cultivated. But notwith&s;tanding all
that, we mu&s;t needs grant on the other hand,
that they had but a very &s;uperficial know|ledge
of that Country, and that what they
have &s;aid of it, might &s;erve indeed to
&s;tir up the Curio&s;ity that many had al|ready
to know it, but could no way &s;atisfie
the Appetite it had rai&s;ed in them, with
any &s;olid and particular Account.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore to our <HI>Sadeur,</HI> who&s;e Re|lation
here follows, that we are wholly obliged
for the Di&s;covery of this before <HI>Unknown</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>Country.</HI> And I doubt not but many per|&s;ons
will be &s;urprized, that the name of a
man to whom the World is &s;o much behold|ing,
&s;hould lye &s;o long concealed in ob&s;curi|ty,
as well as the particulars of his <HI>Rare
Di&s;covery:</HI> But their &s;urprize will undoub|tedly
cea&s;e, when they &s;hall know that the
<HI>Memoirs</HI> from which this Relation was
compo&s;ed, were long <HI>kept private in the
Cabinet of a Late Great Mini&s;ter of
State,</HI> from whence they could not be had
<HI>till after his Death.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Birth and Education of <HI>Sadeur:</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to reflect upon
all the <HI>adventures</HI> of my Life,
without admiring the prodigi|ous
variety of Events which
have accompanied it, &s;o I believed I
ought to make a Collection, and from
thence remark all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
In&s;tances, for altho I have yet no oppor|tunities
to &s;end them into my <HI>own Coun|trey,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
nor &s;ee any probability of return|ing
thither, yet I believe I cannot do
better than commit them to writing, for
the frequent a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Memory,
and my more particular Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I receiv'd a Memoir from a Father Je|&s;uit
of <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> when I was at
<HI>Villa Franca,</HI> which contains an Account
of my Birth, and the <HI>Adventures of my
younger Years,</HI> as I am about to relate.</P>
<P>My Father was called <HI>James Sadeur,</HI>
and my Mother, <HI>Willemetta Ilin,</HI> both
of them were of <HI>Chatillon</HI> upon <HI>Bar</HI> of
the juri&s;diction of <HI>Rochel</HI> in <HI>Campagne,</HI>
a Province of <HI>France.</HI> My Father knew
many Secrets in Mathematicks, which
were owing more to his own Genius
than the Precepts of a Ma&s;ter; particu|larly
he excelled in the inventions of fa|cilitating
the removal of great Bodies or
Burthens. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vare,</HI> who had
then &s;ome Intendance over Sea Affairs
being acquainted with him, brought him
to <HI>Bordeaux,</HI> and from thence to the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> with promi&s;es which he ne|ver
perform'd to him, altho he knew
him to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for his Service:
My Mother who had followed him, pre&s;t
him to return after 9 or 10 Months a|boed
at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and being imbark't,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<HI>April 25. 1603.</HI> &s;he brought me into the
World 15 days after they had been on
Shipboard, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Sarre,</HI> who was
Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el, was plea&s;ed to be
my God-father; <HI>I was Conceived in</HI> Ame|rica
<HI>and brought forth upon the Ocean,</HI> an
infallible pre&s;age of the mi&s;eries which
were to attend me during my whole
Life.</P>
<P>The Voyage was happy enough in all
the places which were e&s;teemed dange|rous,
even to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Aquitain,</HI>
where an unexpected Tempe&s;t &s;o furi|ou&s;ly
engaged the Ve&s;&s;el, that it was
ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Ship|wreckt
near the Cape of <HI>Finisterre,</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Galicia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> with the
lo&s;s of my Father and Mother. The <HI>&s;ame
Memoir,</HI> &s;ays, that my Mother &s;eeing the
Ship let in the Water on every &s;ide,
lifted me out of my Cradle, and em|bracing
me with an extream tenderne&s;s,
and abundance of Tears, &s;aid, <HI>Ah my
dear Child, have I brought thee forth upon
the Waters, to &s;ee thee &s;o &s;oon &s;wallowed
up by them? at lea&s;t I &s;hall have this con|&s;olation
of peri&s;hing with thee.</HI> She had
hardly fini&s;h'd this complaint, when a
more impetuous Wave than any of the
former, breaking into the Ve&s;&s;el, bore
<PB N="4" REF="7">
her away from my Father. In this ex|tremity
every one was &s;en&s;ible that no|thing
was more dear than the pre&s;erva|tion
of his own Life, only my Parents,
who preferring me to them&s;elves, did
expo&s;e them&s;elves to the evident danger
of peri&s;hing to pre&s;erve me alive; the
love that my Mother had for me, made
her not for&s;ake me, for in the lifting
me up continually with her arms above
the Waters &s;he her &s;elf was at la&s;t choak-with
them; the Courage which my Fa|ther
&s;hewed on this occa&s;ion was al&s;o
very particular, for, forgetting him|&s;elf,
in&s;tead of making to the Shore as
did the re&s;t, he came to us by the <HI>Mer|cy
of the Waves,</HI> and imbracing my
Mother, who yet lift me up, he drew us
ju&s;t to the Bank&s;ide, and &s;et us upon
the Sand, but either having wholly
&s;pent him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion, or be|lieving
that we were Dead, he fell down
in a Swound, holding me in his Arms;
altho every one was &s;ufficiently perplext,
yet there was none that did not con&s;ider
this &s;pectacle, and was not amazed at it,
many them&s;elves running to relieve us,
when it was perceived that I had yet
any motion, they took me from the
Arms of my Father, and held me be|fore
<PB N="5" REF="7">
a fire, which the Inhabitants had
kindled out of compa&s;&s;ion to us. There
was no &s;ign of life in my Mother, and
having laid her for &s;ome time before the
fire, they were per&s;waded that &s;he had
more need of a Burial.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had more particularly
known my Father, deplored his fate
with Cries that drew Tears from the In|habitants
of the Countrey, <HI>O Man of
eternal memory,</HI> &s;aid &s;ome, <HI>O too generous
&s;oul, mu&s;t thou dye for being willing to &s;ave
the life of thy Family? Ah,</HI> &s;aid others,
<HI>never was there &s;uch a Tragedy; the
Mother to expo&s;e her &s;elf for the Child,
the Father for the Mother, and yet tho&s;e
generous efforts to terminate in the death
of each other.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether &s;o much lamen|tation
made my Father &s;en&s;ible, but he
open'd his Eyes, and with a feeble and
langui&s;hing voice, &s;aid, <HI>Where art thou
my Dear?</HI> this unexpected &s;peech &s;urpri|zed
the Company, and when they an|&s;wered
him not readily enough, he ad|ded,
<HI>Then let us all three dye together;</HI>
the&s;e were his la&s;t words, and then he
clos'd his eyes and dyed. 'Tis &s;aid&punc;
that he &s;ignalized him&s;elf on many oc|ca&s;ions
in this Voyage; but he drew the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
admiration of every one in this extre|mity:
All tho&s;e who &s;aw him thus ex|pire
could not look upon me without be|ing
moved with pitty, <HI>Poor de&s;titute</HI>
(&s;aid they) <HI>what can become of thee, can
any good fortune attend thee in this world,
thou being the cau&s;e of their death, who
gave thee thy life?</HI> Some believed that
I could not long &s;urvive them, after the
violent &s;truglings which I had under|gone
in the Shipwrick.</P>
<P>But alas! this was but the begin|ning
of a Tragedy, which I have now
continued for about fifty five Years, with
&s;o great and &s;trange Cata&s;tiophes, that
they can never be repre&s;ented in their
whole extent, altho I my &s;elf &s;hould re|late
them all: the heat of the fire &s;oon
impower'd me to weep and lament,
with &s;uch a noi&s;e as gave them to un|der&s;tand
that I was out of danger.</P>
<P>An Inhabitant of the Countrey, who
knew French enough to under&s;tand
what had pa&s;t, remembred that he had
an only Son who dyed not long before,
and re&s;embled me, this mov'd him to
u&s;e his intere&s;t to get me; they repre|&s;ented
to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Sacre</HI> that this was
a very favourable opportunity, and
that he could not ea&s;ily refu&s;e it without
<PB N="7" REF="8">
putting me in evident danger, he there|upon
con&s;ented, being rather con&s;train'd
by nece&s;&s;ity than any other con&s;ide|ration;
this man &s;oon adapted me into
the place of his Son, and his Wife ha|ving,
heard the whole relation embrac'd
and entertain'd me with great Care&s;&s;es:
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Sarre,</HI> and &s;ome others of the
mo&s;t skilful in the Ve&s;&s;el, knowing that
they were near to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, took a
re&s;olution of vi&s;iting the Church which
is con&s;ecrated to God, under the name
of this Saint, and there by good fortune
they found Merchants of their own ac|quaintance,
who equip'd and gave them
opportunity of returning creditably to
<HI>Oleron. Mon&s;ieur de Sarre</HI> after his ar|rival,
began to particularize his adven|tures
to his Wife, and de&s;cribe the Ship|wreck
which he had e&s;cap'd, but it was
&s;ome time before &s;he could attend to it,
for the joy of having received her
Husband &s;afe from the danger of &s;o
long and tedious a Voyage; this wholly
took her thoughts in the fir&s;t moments
of his return: But &s;ome time after &s;he
prayed her Husband to give her the
<HI>Hi&s;tory of the Shipwreck,</HI> and then &s;he
could not forbear admiring the Conju|gal
and paternal Love of my Parents,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
who for my &s;ake underwent a volunta|ry
death; and in&s;tead of conceiving an
indignation for me, &s;he took &s;uch an
affection to me, e&s;pecially when &s;he
under&s;tood that her Husband was my
Godfather, that &s;he continually impor|tuned
him to find &s;ome means of re|gaining
me; whereupon he re-imbarkt
22 Months after his return, and in 15
days arrived at <HI>Camarinas,</HI> where he
found me very well, and about 30
Months old, equally cheri&s;h'd by a Fa|ther
and Mother, whom I believed to
be my Parents; as &s;oon as he had de|clared
to them the rea&s;ons of his coming,
and the de&s;ign he had to pay for my
entertainment, proportionable to the
time that they had kept me, the&s;e good
People were mightily offended, and de|termined
not to part from me; <HI>Mon&s;ieur
de Sarre</HI> alledged his <HI>right of Godfather,</HI>
and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon the Do|nation
and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, this Cau&s;e was
brought before the Judges of <HI>Camarinas,</HI>
who, having decided in favour of my
Fo&s;ter Parents, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Sarre,</HI> for
fear of having made a Voyage to his
&s;hame re&s;olv'd to &s;teal me away, and
fly under favour of the Wind which then
&s;tood for him, and entring roughly into
<PB N="9" REF="9">
the hou&s;e with a Valet where I was, and
&s;eeing only one Servant-Maid which
held me, he &s;natcht me into his arms,
and gain'd the Bark which was ready
to Sail; the fear that I was in, and the
Cries that I uttered threw me into a
kind of Convul&s;ive Swound; as &s;oon as
I came to my &s;elf, they found me in a
great Fevor: My fo&s;ter Father being
advertized, and ju&s;tly provokt with
this attempt, ran with other people
towards the Forts, and perceiving
that we were out of attack, they made
a di&s;charge, which gave occa&s;ion to a
<HI>Portugueze</HI> Ve&s;&s;el who lay to the South,
to di&s;charge a volly of Canon upon us,
with &s;uch misfortune that a Bullet broke
a Plank out of our Ve&s;&s;el, ju&s;t at the
top of the water, and &s;unk her down to
rights, tho not without &s;ome re&s;pect of
being the cau&s;e of the death of per&s;ons
they knew not; tho&s;e in the Road &s;ee|ing
this accident made what ha&s;te they
could away, and the <HI>Portugueze</HI> &s;ent
two Shalops to endeavour to &s;ave tho&s;e
which peri&s;hed, they only pre&s;erv'd a
Valet, who knew how to &s;wim better
than the re&s;t, and as I floated upon the
Waters, by means of the Straw in my
Cradle, it happened that I was al&s;o ta|ken
<PB N="10" REF="10">
up: I am troubled to write
that which no body can read with|out
looking upon me as a <HI>kind of Viper,</HI>
which lived by the death of tho&s;e who
took pains to pre&s;erve my life; the
<HI>Portuguzes</HI> fearing a ju&s;t reproof for
their Crime, put out &s;peedily to the
main Sea, and finding that I was yet
alive, they committed me to the care
of a <HI>Portuguze Matron,</HI> who was in their
Ve&s;&s;el&punc; &s;he profe&s;t a great de&s;ire of &s;er|ving
me, till &s;he found that I was of two
<HI>Sexes,</HI> I would &s;ay an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI>
for afterward &s;he conceiv'd &s;uch an a|ver&s;ion
for me, that it was a trouble
to her to look upon me, and as my
Fevor encreas'd, my death had been
inevitable without the particular care of
<HI>Mon&s;ieur de Sarre</HI>'s Valet. One might

advertized of the Evils which I had
been the cau&s;e of till then, very &s;eriou&s;ly

the re&s;ult was, that they &s;hould take a

him the <HI>Latin, Greek, French</HI> and <HI>Ita|lian
Tongues;</HI> the Principles of A&s;tro|nomy,
Geography, Philo&s;ophy, and
the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Spain,</HI> with Chronology.
The Counte&s;s, who &s;hewed the &s;ame
affections to me as if I had been of her

very &s;erviceable to the progre&s;s of the
Count in his Studies, was willing that
I &s;hould lay by the Livery, and Study
Philo&s;ophy, and having accompli&s;ht

to harrangue, and begin the Di&s;pute.
Above 15 days before our departure, I
had my mind &s;o agitated, that I <HI>vi&s;ibly
dryed away,</HI> &s;o that my blood congealed,

go by Sea, all the &s;tory of my misfor|tunes
which had happened there before;
pierc'd my mind after &s;o feeling a manner,
that I believed there was no mean be|twixt
embarking and peri&s;hing, I en|treated
then that I might travel by Land
with part of his Train, <HI>But how little

if my Life lay only at the Stake I &s;hould

which was born up and began to &s;wim,
and as I was about to peri&s;h I catcht

becau&s;e I was di&s;tracted and void of

in recovering my perfect health, which
&s;o &s;oon as I got, I conjured the Com|pany
to di&s;chage me at any rate what|ever,
I recited all the misfortunes
which had happened to me upon the
water, and omitted nothing which
<PB N="19" REF="14">
might per&s;wade them that this Element
was extremely fatal to me, but the
more I &s;tudied rea&s;ons to work 'em in|to

with my &s;elf to in&s;i&s;t no longer upon that

abandon my &s;elf to the <HI>Cour&s;e of my De|&s;tiny.</HI>
The Captain told me that the re|&s;pect
he had for, and knowledge he
had of that Hou&s;e, where he had of|ten
&s;een me, obliged him to conduct
me thither, that he might deliver me
to the Counte&s;s, adding, that he e&s;teem'd
this occurrance more happy than all the

<HI>Maninga:</HI> There was no &s;ickne&s;s a|mong&s;t

At la&s;t it was re&s;olv'd to &s;tay in this Port

the Language of the Countrey,

<P>The natural inclination which I al|ways

<P><PB N="21" REF="15">
This Country has not half the Inha|bitants
in it that <HI>Portugal</HI> has; I know
not whether it may happen from the lit|tle

there is to engender: The Men there are
entirely <HI>naked,</HI> only within the&s;e few

of their Countrey renders them
negligent, &s;lothful, &s;imple and &s;tupid;
after having con&s;idered them &s;ometimes,
I was forced to acknowledge, that Man
naturally becomes &s;lothful when he has
nothing to do, and that Idlene&s;s trans|forms
him to a Bea&s;t. The Soil of the&s;e
Regions, which is watered throughout
with the Rivers of <HI>Zair</HI> and <HI>Cariza,</HI>
produces Fruits in Abundance, without
any Labour, and the&s;e Fruits are &s;o <HI>deli|cate

tho&s;e that drink thereof. We &s;taid
there a con&s;iderable time, but without
any expen&s;e, becau&s;e the People de&s;pi&s;e
Gain, the Countrey furni&s;hing in abun|dance
all that one can wi&s;h. There's &s;o
little need of Hou&s;es in this Countrey,
<PB N="22" REF="16">
that no body goes into them; and as the
Nights have all the &s;weetne&s;s that one

how to make u&s;e of Beds, yet they have
their Re&s;erves of &s;ome Mattre&s;&s;es, for
the weaker &s;ort to lye upon, tho there is
no body that &s;leeps not upon the Ground,
All the&s;e Con&s;iderations gave me an Idea

Labour, lived with &s;ome ju&s;tice in the
mid&s;t of Idlene&s;s, which rendred them
dull, negligent, &s;leeping, di&s;dainful,

the River <HI>Zair,</HI> to a <HI>Lake</HI> of the &s;ame

po&s;&s;ible in this Voyage. Take
one part of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Re|marks

Memory will a&s;&s;i&s;t me. We arrived in
twenty four days at the mouth of the

came back again to the Fleet in twenty

that their Paws are as large as the Feet of
our Drakes, and tho&s;e before are twice or

&s;o great an Inclination for a Man that
they will &s;eek him out, and offer them
&s;elves to him, as &s;o much Sacrifice, it

of the other Ships, nor what was
the fortune of my Companions in this
wreck, becau&s;e 'twas in the night, and
very dark; for I was only bu&s;ied how
to &s;ave my &s;elf: my other Shipwrack
had given me Experience and Faith, I
had &s;ought for a light Plauck during the
dangers of the Tempe&s;t; and I will
&s;ay it to my &s;hame, that being far enough
removed from the approaches of death,
I always appeared very indifferent as
to my Life, but in this evident danger,
I could think of nothing el&s;e but how
to &s;ave my &s;elf. I floated for many
hours by the means of my Plank, with
&s;uch a to&s;&s;ing and turning over and o|ver,
<PB N="33" REF="22">
that I can't now think of it with|out
horror: The Waves did &s;o often

la&s;t I lo&s;t both knowledge and think|ing,
and truly I knew not what be|came

pre&s;erved from death; I only remem|ber
that coming to my &s;elf I opened
my eyes, and found a calm Sea, I per|ceived
an I&s;le very near, and I felt my

could hardly loo&s;e them, and my &s;in|gers
were &s;o crooked that I could not

the &s;ight of this I&s;land encouraged me
very much, and infine, being come on
&s;hore, I drag'd my &s;elf under a Tree,
without thinking of any thing but lan|gui&s;hing,
and expecting death in a little
time; I found under this Tree two
fruits, about the bigne&s;s, and like in
Colour to our Pomegranets, with this
difference, that their ta&s;t appeared to me
much more delicate, &s;ub&s;tantial and

&s;leep I found that I was not in the lea&s;t
a weary, I &s;aw that my Cloaths were
dry, and the Sun &s;hone, and in&s;pired
me with a courage and hope: I found
two other fruits, which I did eat, and
having applyed my &s;elf to find out the
Elevation of the Sun, I judged that I
was 33 deg. Lat. South, but I knew
not the Longitude; having re&s;ted my
&s;elf again I re&s;olved to advance into the
I&s;le, to di&s;cover if there were any In|habitants,
I plainly &s;aw the appearance
of &s;ome ways, but they led into very
thick Bu&s;hes, where I could not pa&s;s
without &s;tooping, which gave me very
&s;trange thoughts; having found a tree
much higher than the re&s;t, I thought
that if I climbed to the top of it, I
might di&s;cover &s;ome place or other,
but as I got up I heard a great noi&s;e,
and I &s;aw two prodigious flying Bea&s;ts,
which came to the top of the tree,
obliged me to get down a little fa&s;ter
than I got up: Be not &s;urprized at the
name of Bea&s;t, which I here gave to the
Birds, for they were &s;o very large that I
was frighted at them, and &s;peak then
<PB N="35" REF="23">
as I thought. I got down with all the
&s;peed imaginable, but I was no &s;ooner
down, but heard &s;o frightful a Cry,
that I expected every moment to be
devoured: In fine, coming to my &s;elf,
I reflected upon the mi&s;ery I &s;aw my
&s;elf reduc'd to, I concluded that it were
better to dye forthwith, than to &s;eek
to langui&s;h any longer, after all, I &s;aid,
there's a nece&s;&s;ity that I dye by &s;ome
means or other, and I cannot &s;hun one
danger, but run into a greater.</P>
<P>I then made a re&s;olute preparation for
death, and remembring that my Father
and Mother expir'd upon the Sea &s;hore,
I made thither, where I had left my
Plank: I had &s;carce left my place but I
was followed by a great number of Ani|mals,
which I could not di&s;tingui&s;h
from one another, neverthele&s;s I had
my judgment as ready as could po&s;&s;i|bly

but with pointed Heads, and claw-footed,
I can't tell whether the&s;e were not of
tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, which came to light upon
the tree where I was, but they had
Wings and Feathers. I &s;aw certain kinds
of great Dogs, and many other &s;orts
of Animals, which don't at all re&s;emble
<PB N="36" REF="24">
any that we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> they made
great Crys &s;o &s;oon as they perceiv'd me,
and as they approacht nearer and near|er
they redoubled the Noi&s;e. I re&s;ol|ved
to defend my life, and took my
Plank and began to exerci&s;e it, in turn|ing
and returning it, which made 'em
very attentive, till two of the large&s;t
Bea&s;ts approacht to come in with me,
I turned to one of them, and &s;truck
it &s;o roughly that it ran back to the
other Animals, which &s;et 'em all on
howling: I was &s;eized with an extreme
fear, at the redoubling of the&s;e terri|ble
cries, and in great ha&s;t took three
fruits of the Tree which I have &s;poken
of, and ca&s;t my &s;elf into the Wa|ter
with my Plank; after having
&s;wam &s;uch a di&s;tance as it was rea&s;ona|ble
enough for me to believe I was out
of all danger: I turned my eyes to|ward
the I&s;le, and I &s;aw upon the &s;hoar
all that great number of Animals which
I fled from, part of them put them&s;elves
readily to &s;wim, and pur&s;ued me with
that vigour and ha&s;t, that they were
not long before they came up to me,
when I &s;aw that I could not e&s;cape, I
turned towards them, and pre&s;ented the
end of my Plank to them, with &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="37" REF="24">
happy enough, for as they pre&s;t on to
take and bite the end, they made me
advance as fa&s;t as them&s;elves, this ma|nagement
continued till I arrived at a
&s;mall kind of a little I&s;le, which floated
upon the Water; and which carried
me away, &s;wift enough to remove the
means of my Enemies joyning me: they
followed me neverthele&s;s with a Cou|rage,
or rather with an encrea&s;ed Rage,
till they di&s;paired of being able to come
at me again; but at la&s;t my I&s;le happen|ing
to &s;toop on a &s;udden, they had
time of coming up to me again: I
&s;carce knew what to think, and began
to make unprofitable reflections in de|vi&s;ing
the cau&s;e of the Immobility of
the I&s;le, who&s;e motion had been &s;o favou|rable

when they were ready to fall up|on
me. I covered my &s;elf with my
plank, to avoid their fir&s;t attacks, which
were &s;o rude that with a &s;troak with
their Beak, they pierc'd it thro', 'twas
then that my I&s;le rai&s;ing it &s;elf, &s;ud|denly

howled at the lo&s;s of his blood, tumbled
and turned him&s;elf after a thou&s;and
ways to &s;hake me off, and con&s;train me
to leave him.</P>
<P>I thought then of nothing el&s;e but of
holding him fa&s;t, to hinder the effect
of his effort, becau&s;e that my Plank
which was my only a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being lo&s;t,
I &s;aw no mean betwixt quitting him and
peri&s;hing: at la&s;t he &s;taied upon the
Water without any other motion than
an Ox, who&s;e throat is cut, confe&s;&s;ing
by his &s;tilne&s;s that I had overcome him,
having then &s;ome lei&s;ure to take breath
and to think of my Wounds, I could
<PB N="44" REF="28">
not di&s;tingui&s;h any part in all my body
which was not torn and bloody; my
Cloaths were all rent, not one part e&s;|caping,
whole, the water of the Sea,
altho 'twas very fre&s;h in that place, yet
was &s;alt enough to cau&s;e &s;uch pain as
made me lo&s;e my Sen&s;es. I apprehend|ed
&s;ometime afterwards, that &s;ome
Guards from the Sea &s;aw part of this
Combat, and that four were come in a
little Shalop to &s;ee if they could know
who I was, they believed me to be with|out
Life, and drew me into their Boat
as a dead man, who had expired in his Vi|ctory:
as &s;oon as they perceiv'd any
motion in my heart, they put into my
Mouth, No&s;e and Ears a Liquor, which
&s;oon made me open my Eyes, and &s;ee
my <HI>Benefactors;</HI> they made me drink of
a &s;ort of Water, which gave me new
&s;trength, and recovered my Spirits;
they wa&s;ht my Body with an odoriferous
Water, they anointed my Wounds
and bound them up very Commodiou&s;ly,
having thus brought me out of danger,
they pur&s;ued my Enemies, and having
drawn the la&s;t into the Boat, they laid
him at my feet, the other had &s;till &s;ome
motion; but explaining to them by &s;igns
that I had pluckt out his Eyes, they pur|&s;ued
<PB N="45" REF="28">
him, took him, and laid him upon
the other, with great marks of rejoycing,
they returned to Land, from which they
were di&s;tant about three hours rowing,
and having brought me to &s;hoar, they
bore the two Fowls at my feet, with ac|clamations,
like to tho&s;e they are u&s;ed to
make in their greate&s;t Victories.</P>

<P>IF there was any thing in the World
which could per&s;wade me of the in|evitable
fatallity of humane things, and
the infalible accompli&s;hments of tho&s;e
events, the Chain of which compo&s;es the
de&s;tiny of Mankind, it would certainly
be this Hi&s;tory that I am writing; there
is not on &s;ingle accident of my Life,
which has not been &s;erviceable either
to direct or &s;upport me in this new
Country, where it was decreed I &s;hould
one day be driven. My often Shipwracks
taught me to bear them; both Sexes
were nece&s;&s;ary for me under pain of
being de&s;troyed at my arrival, as I &s;hall
&s;how in the &s;equel of my Story. It was
<PB N="46" REF="29">
my good fortune to be found naked, o|therwi&s;e
I had been known to be a Stran|ger
in a Land where no one wears any
covering, without that terrible com|bat
that I was obliged to maintain
again&s;t the mon&s;trous Fowls I have be|fore
mention'd, and which brought me
into great reputation among&s;t tho&s;e
that were wittne&s;&s;es of it, I &s;hould have
been forced to have &s;ubmitted to an
examination, that would have been in|fallibly
followed with my death. In|fine,
the more all the Circum&s;tances of
my Voyages and perils &s;hall be con&s;ide|red,
the more clearly it will appear
that there is a certain order of things in
the fate of man, and &s;uch a chain of
effects that nothing can prevent, and
which brings us by a thou&s;and imper|ceptible
turnings, to the end to which
we are de&s;tined.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of the Inhabitants of
this Country is never to receive any
per&s;on among&s;t them, who&s;e Humour,
Birth and Country, they know not be|fore:
But the extraordinary Courge
with which they had &s;een me fight;
and the great admiration they conceiv'd
at my reviving after it, made me with|out
any inque&s;t be admitted into the
<PB N="47" REF="29">
neighbouring quarter, where every one
came to <HI>Ki&s;s my Hands:</HI> They would
al&s;o have carryed me upon their Heads,
the greate&s;t mark of high e&s;teem that
they &s;how to any per&s;on; but as they
perceived it could not be without in|comoding
me, &s;o they omitted this ce|remony.
My reception being made,
tho&s;e that had brought and comforted
me, carryed me to the Hou&s;e of the
<HI>Heb,</HI> which &s;ignifies, a Hou&s;e of Edu|cation;
they had provided me a lodg|ing,
and all things nece&s;&s;ary, with &s;uch
a diligence, as &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Civility of
the mo&s;t poli&s;hed Europeans: I was
&s;carcely arrived when two Hundred
young <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> came and &s;aluted me
in a very friendly manner; the de&s;ire
I had to &s;peak to them, made me call to
mind &s;ome words that I had heard at
<HI>Congo,</HI> and among others that of <HI>Rim|len,</HI>
which I made u&s;e of, it &s;ignifies,
<HI>I am your Servant,</HI> at this word they
believed me to be of their own Coun|try,
and cryed out with great &s;igns of
joy, <HI>Le cle, le cle,</HI> that is, <HI>our Brother,
our Brother,</HI> and at the &s;ame time pre|&s;ented
me with two fruits of a red
colour, intermixt with blew, I had no
&s;ooner eat them, but they refre&s;hed,
<PB N="48" REF="30">
and &s;trengthend me very much; they
gave me afterwards a kind of a yel|low
bottle of Liquor, that held a|bout
a good gla&s;s, which I drank with
&s;uch a plea&s;ure as I had never before
felt: I was in this Country, and a|mong&s;t
the&s;e <HI>New faces, like a man fallen
from the Clouds,</HI> and I found it difficult
to believe I truly &s;aw what I did; I
imagin'd to my &s;elf &s;ometimes, that per|haps
I might be dead, or at lea&s;t in a
Trance, and when I convinced my &s;elf
by many rea&s;ons, that I was certainly a|live,
and in my perfect &s;ences; and yet
I could not per&s;wade my &s;elf that I was in
the &s;ame Country, or with men of the
&s;ame Nature of our Europeans: I was
entirely: cured in fifteen days, and
in five Months learnt enough of the Lan|guage
to under&s;tand others, and to ex|plain
my &s;elf to them. I have here there|fore
&s;et down the be&s;t account of the
<HI>Au&s;tralian Territories</HI> that I could get ei|ther
by the relations of others, or cou'd
de&s;cribe according to the Meridan of
<HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>It begins in the three hundred and
fortieth Meridian, towards the fifty &s;e|cond
degree of Southern Elevation, it
advances on the &s;ide of the Line, in
<PB N="49" REF="30">
forty Meridians, until it comes to the
fortieth degree. The whole Land is
called <HI>Hu&s;t:</HI> The Land continues in this
elevation, about 15 degrees, and they
call it <HI>Hube;</HI> from the fifteenth Meridi|an
the Sea gains, and &s;inks by little and
little into twenty five Meridians, until
it comes to the fifty fir&s;t degree. And
all on the we&s;tern &s;ide is called <HI>Hump:</HI>
The Sea makes a very con&s;iderable Gulph
there, which they call <HI>Ilab:</HI> The Earth
afterwards falls back towards the Line,
and in four Meridians advances unto the

this Ea&s;tern &s;ide is called <HI>Hue:</HI> The Earth
continues in this elevation about thirty
&s;ix Meridians, which they call <HI>Huod;</HI>
after this long extent of Earth, the Sea
regains, and advances unto the forty-|ninth
degree, in three Meridians, and
having made a kind of &s;emicircle in five
Meridians, the Earth returns and goes

wholly overflowing the Earth,
and falls again by little and little towards
the Pole, that Earth by degrees giving
way unto the &s;ixtyieth Meridian, on this
&s;ide are the Countries of <HI>Hulg, Pulg,</HI>
and <HI>Mulg;</HI> towards the fifty fourth de|gree
of elevation, appears the mouth
of the River <HI>Sulm,</HI> which makes a very
con&s;iderable Gulph: Upon the borders
of this River live a people which are
very like the <HI>Europians,</HI> who are under
the Obedience of many Kings.</P>
<P>This is all that I can have a certain
knowledge of, as to that &s;ide of <HI>Au&s;tralia,</HI>
which is towards the Line; it is limited
towards the Pole, by prodigious Moun|tains,
much higher and more in acce&s;&s;ible
than the <HI>Pirhenean,</HI> which &s;eparate <HI>France</HI>
from <HI>Spain;</HI> they call them <HI>Ivas,</HI> and
they begin towards the fiftieth degree,
falling in&s;en&s;ibly, for &s;ixty five Meridi|ans,
unto the &s;ixtieth degree, and then
ri&s;ing again unto the forty eighth, and
returning afterwards unto the fifty fifth
degree, after which it ri&s;es to the forty
third, and then ends in the Sea.</P>
<P>At the foot of the&s;e Mountains they
di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e following Countrys;
<HI>Curf,</HI> which extends it &s;elf from the
Mountains unto <HI>Huff;</HI> afterwards <HI>Curd;</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="31">
then <HI>Gurf, Durf, Jurf,</HI> and <HI>Surf,</HI> which
la&s;t ends in the Sea. In the middle of
the Countrys, between the Mountains
and the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Coa&s;ts lies <HI>Trum,
Sum, Burd, Purd Burf, Turf,</HI> and <HI>Pulg,</HI>
which joyns to the Sea. Thus the Au|&s;tralian
Territories contain twenty &s;e|ven
different Countries, which are all
very con&s;iderable, and are altogether
about three thou&s;and Legues in length,
and four or five hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>The Vally which is on the other &s;ide
of the Mountains is &s;ometimes twenty
degrees broad, and &s;ometimes but &s;ix on|ly,
it is parted by two Rivers, which are
very broad at the mouth, one of which
runs to the We&s;t, and is called <HI>Sulm,</HI> and
the other to the Ea&s;t, named <HI>Hulm.</HI></P>
<P>The length of this Country is about
eight hundred Leagues, and its breadth
&s;ix hundred in &s;ome places, but in mo&s;t
but three. All this va&s;t Land is called
<HI>Fund;</HI> and is under two or three Go|vernors,
which very often make cruel
Wars, one again&s;t the other. But what
is mo&s;t &s;urprizing in the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Do|minions,
is, that there is not one
Mountain to be &s;een; the Natives ha|ving
levelled them all. To this prodi|gy
may by added the admirable unifor|mity
<PB N="52" REF="32">
of Languages, Cu&s;toms, Buildings,
and other things which are to be met
with in this Country. 'Tis &s;ufficient to
know one Quarter, to make a certain
judgment of all the re&s;t; all which with|out
doubt proceeds from the nature of
the people, who are all born with an
inclination of willing nothing contrary
to one another; and if it &s;hould happen
that any one of them had any thing that
was not Common, 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible
for him to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>There are fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Sezains,</HI> in
this prodigious Country: Each <HI>Sezain</HI>
contains &s;ixteen quarters, without count|ing
the <HI>Hub,</HI> and the four <HI>Hebs;</HI> there
is twenty five hou&s;es in each quarter,
and every hou&s;e has four apartments,
which lodge four men each; &s;o that
there is four hundred hou&s;es in each <HI>Se|zain,</HI>
and &s;ix thou&s;and four hundred per|&s;ons;
which being multiplied by fifteen
thou&s;and <HI>Sezains,</HI> will &s;hew the number
of the Inhabitants of the whole Land, to
be about four&s;core and 16 Millions, with|counting
all the Youth, and Ma&s;ters lodg|ed
in the <HI>Hebs,</HI> in each of which there
is at lea&s;t eight hundred per&s;ons; and
as in the fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Sezains,</HI> there
is &s;ixty thou&s;and <HI>Hebs,</HI> &s;o the young
<PB N="53" REF="32">
men, and the Ma&s;ters that teach them,
will be found to amount to near forty
eight millions.</P>
<P>The great Hou&s;e of the <HI>Sezain,</HI> which
they call the <HI>Hab,</HI> that is, the Hou&s;e of
elevation, is built only with diaphonous
and tran&s;parent Stones, like to our fine&s;t
Cry&s;tal, only the&s;e Stones are diver&s;ify'd
with a prodigious quantity of Figures of
all forts of colours, very fine and lively,
which by their infinite variety form
&s;ometimes Images of Mankind, &s;ometimes
repre&s;ent the Fields in all their Beauty,
and &s;ometimes Suns and other Figures,
of &s;uch a vivacity, as can never be too
much admired. The whole Building is
without any Artifice, except the curious
cut of this Stone, with Seats all round it,
and &s;ixteen great Tables of a much more
lively red than that of our &s;carlet.</P>
<P>There is four very con&s;iderable En|trances,
that an&s;wer to the four great ways
upon which it is &s;ituate: All without is
filled with very rare Inventions. They
a&s;cend unto the top of it by a thou&s;and
&s;teps, upon which there is a kind of
Platform, that will ea&s;ily contain forty
per&s;ons. The Pavement of this &s;tately
Hou&s;e is much like our Ja&s;per, but the
colours thereof are much more lively
<PB N="54" REF="33">
and are al&s;o full of Veins, of a very
rich blew, and a yellow which &s;urpa&s;&s;es
the brightne&s;s of Gold: No one for a
con&s;tancy lives in it, but each Quarter
take their turns to &s;upply the Tables for
the refre&s;hment of Pa&s;&s;engers. This
great Hou&s;e built in the middle of the
<HI>Sezain,</HI> and is about an hundred paces
daimeter, and three hundred and thirty
in circumference.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of the four Quarters by
them called <HI>Heb,</HI> which is the Hou&s;e of
Education, is built of the &s;ame Stone
that the <HI>Hab</HI> is paved with, except the
Roof of it, which is made of a tran&s;pa|rent
Stone, through which the Light en|ters
into it.</P>
<P>The Pavement of it &s;omething re&s;em|bles
our white Marble, but is intermixed
with a mo&s;t lively red and green. This
fine Building is divided into four quar|ters,
by twelve great Cro&s;&s;ings, which
are made like four Semi-diameters: It is
about fifty paces diameter, and about an
hundred and fifty three paces in circuit.
Each Divi&s;ion is allotted to the Youth of
that Quarter it belongs to; and there is
at lea&s;t two hundred Children, who&s;e
Mothers, as &s;oon as they have conceived
of them, enter there, and depart not
<PB N="55" REF="33">
till the Children are two years of age,
and then they go out, leaving them to
the Care of certain young men, who
are there on purpo&s;e to in&s;truct them.
The&s;e young men, whereof there is a
very great number, are divided into five
Companies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t are employed in teaching
Fir&s;t-Principles, of which there are &s;ix
Ma&s;ters. The &s;econd make it their bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to give the common Rea&s;ons for
Natural things, among which there are
four Ma&s;ters. The third are &s;uch as are
remitted to di&s;pute, of whom there is
two Ma&s;ters. The fourth are &s;uch as can
compo&s;e, and they have but one Ma&s;ter.
The fifth and la&s;t are tho&s;e that expect
to be cho&s;e for Lieutenants, that is, to
fill the place of the Brethren that retire
from the World, of whom I &s;hall give a
particular account afterwards.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the peculiar Officers of each
Quarter, which contribute to the main|tenance,
and educating part of the World,
and they carry very regularly every day
what is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
when they go to the Conference held in
the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The common Hou&s;es, which they call
<HI>Hebs,</HI> that is, the Habitation of Men, are
<PB N="56" REF="34">
in number twenty five in each Quarter,
each Hou&s;e twenty five paces diameter,
and four&s;core paces in circumference.
They are divided like the <HI>Hebs,</HI> by two
great Walls, which make four di&s;tinct
&s;eparations, and end each at an Apart|ment.
They are built with white Mar|ble,
like the Pavement of the <HI>Hebs,</HI> ex|cept
the cro&s;s Bars of the Windows, which
are of the &s;ame Cry&s;tal with the <HI>Habs,</HI>
for the conveniency of giving Light to
them. Each Apartment is inhabited by
four per&s;ons, whom they call the <HI>Cle,</HI>
that is, <HI>Brethren.</HI> There is nothing to
be &s;een in the&s;e Buildings but four kinds
of Benches, which &s;erve them to re&s;t them|&s;elves
on, and &s;ome Seats for the &s;ame
u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Partitions that they call <HI>Huids</HI> are
near three hundred paces in circumfe|rence,
and &s;ixty five in diameter: The
Figure of them is perfectly &s;quare, and
they are divided into twelve curious Al|lies,
each of which goes round the Apart|ments,
with a &s;quare place in the middle
that is &s;ix paces diameter.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t and greate&s;t Rows are
beautified with Trees, which bear &s;uch
Fruits as are in great e&s;teem among&s;t
them. The&s;e Fruits are as big as the
<PB N="57" REF="34">
Calleba&s;hes of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which are &s;even
or eight inches diameter. The in&s;ide of
them is red, and of a more exqui&s;ite
ta&s;te than any of our mo&s;t delicate Meats,
one of which Fruits is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfie
four men, though never &s;o hungry.</P>
<P>The next five are al&s;o planted with
Trees that bear Fruits of a charming yel|low,
full of a mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Juice,
which is very refre&s;hing: The Liquor of
one of the&s;e Fruits will quench any ones
thir&s;t; and their cu&s;tom is to drink three
of them at a Meal.</P>
<P>The four la&s;t rows are filled with little
Trees, which bear a Fruit about as large
as a Pappin, of a bright purple; its &s;mell
is very fine, and &s;o extraordinary the
ta&s;te, that I can compare nothing to it,
that we eat in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Fruit hath
a Propriety of cau&s;ing Sleep according to
the proportion they eat thereof, &s;ome of
which they are accu&s;tom'd to eat every
night, and if they eat but one, they are
&s;ure of &s;leeping three hours.</P>
<P>In each Alley they dig two Furrows of
an indifferent depth, in which there
grows Roots that bring forth three &s;orts
of Fruits, one of which is not unlike our
Melons; the &s;econd are as big as Boon|chretins,
but of a lovely blue; and the
<PB N="58" REF="35">
third much re&s;emble the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gourd,
but the colour and ta&s;te are very diffe|rent.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fruits are equally in u&s;e through|out
all parts of this va&s;t Country for their
nouri&s;hment. They have no Ovens, nor
any way to bake any Meat for them:
They neither know what Kitchin or
Cook means; their Fruits fully &s;atisfie
their Appetite, without ever the lea&s;t of|fending
their Stomachs; they al&s;o make
them &s;trong and vigorous, and do not
overcharge them, or cau&s;e any dige&s;tion,
becau&s;e they are perfectly ripe, and have
nothing green or crude remains in them.</P>
<P>There is a Tree in the middle of the
Square which is higher than the re&s;t, that
bears a Fruit as big as our Olives, but the
colour red, they call it <HI>Balf,</HI> or Tree of
Beauty, whereof if they eat four, they
become exce&s;&s;ively gay and &s;prightly; if
they eat &s;ix, they fall into a Sleep for
twenty four hours, but if they exceed
that number, they &s;leep eternally, which
mortal &s;leep is preceded, with all the &s;igns
of the greate&s;t Joy and Plea&s;ure in the
World.</P>
<P>'Tis very &s;eldom that the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI>
&s;ing throughout their whole lives, and
never dance; but they have no &s;ooner
<PB N="59" REF="35">
eat this Fruit in &s;uch quantity as I before
&s;poke of, but they &s;ing and dance until
Death puts a period to their exce&s;&s;ive
Mirth.</P>
<P>I ought not to forget, that all the Trees
which I have &s;poken of are at all times
full of ripe Fruits, Flowers, and Buds;
we have an Image of this marvellous
Fruitfulne&s;s in out Oranges, but with
this difference, that the &s;everity of our
Winters and heats of our Summers very
much injure them; whereas in this Coun|try
it is a very difficult thing to be able
to ob&s;erve any alteration.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, it is ea&s;ie to
imagin, that this great Country is plain,
without <HI>Fore&s;ts, Mar&s;hes,</HI> or <HI>De&s;arts,</HI> and
equally, inhabited throughout; never|thele&s;s
it de&s;cends &s;omewhat towards the
Line, and there is an in&s;en&s;ible a&s;cention
on the &s;ide of the Pole; but in four or
five hundred leagues it gains at lea&s;t three
in height.</P>
<P>There is a great quantity of Water
that runs from the Mountains <HI>Juads,</HI> and
the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> know how to conduct
them &s;o exactly, that they have brought
them round all their <HI>Sezains, Quarters,</HI>
and <HI>Apartments,</HI> which contribute much
to the fruitfulne&s;s of their Grounds.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="36">
The De&s;cent which I &s;poke of is not
only in re&s;pect to the Continent, but the
Sea al&s;o, which is &s;o &s;hallow for three
league, that it is trouble&s;ome to go with
a Boat thereon; it is not upon the &s;ide of
the &s;hore a Fingers depth, and after a
league it is not above a foot deep, and &s;o

to conceive, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to come
to this Land from the Sea &s;ide, without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome few Rivers, which
are only known to the Inhabitants of this
Country.</P>
<P>This &s;ame De&s;cent is the cau&s;e al&s;o
that this whole Land is turn'd directly to|wards
the Sun, to receive its Rays, and
with &s;o much advantage, that it is al|mo&s;t

the&s;e terrible Bulwarks &s;erve to
&s;top the Rays of the Sun, and reflect
them back to the farthe&s;t parts of this

<PB N="61" REF="36">
ther exce&s;s of Heat in Summer, nor Cold
in Winter, or rather to have properly
neither Winter nor Summer.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition ought not to &s;urprize
the Geographers, who having divided
the Earth into two equal parts, by the
Equinoxial Line, place as much heat and
cold on one &s;ide, as on the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oun|ded
upon this Principle, that the proxi|mity
or di&s;tance of the Sun cau&s;es Sum|mer
or Winter throughout the whole
Earth: But there are al&s;o Geographers
which have corrected this Error, and
without any knowledge of the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI>
Land&punc; have ob&s;erved, that if his Princi|ple
was true, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t of nece&s;&s;ity be al|ways

than in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e
the Sun is never &s;o far di&s;tant: Which is
contrary to the Experience of all tho&s;e
that have made a Voyage into that
Country, who a&s;&s;ure us, the greate&s;t heats
there are always in the Dog-days, and
the greate&s;t Colds when the Sun is in
the Signs of <HI>Aquaries</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> altho' it
is farther from them when it is in <HI>Capri|corn.</HI>
It is therefore mo&s;t certain, that
Winter and Summer happen univer&s;ally
throughout all the Earth in the &s;ame
time, altho' with great difference, accor|ding
<PB N="62" REF="37">
to the different &s;ituations of the
Countries. I &s;ay moreover, the nearne&s;s
of the Sun contributes &s;o little to the heat
of the Earth, that if we do but narrowly
ob&s;erve it, we &s;hall find when it is neare&s;t
'tis then that the lea&s;t heat is &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t; for 'tis
well known in <HI>Europe,</HI> that the Months

<HI>June,</HI> when the Sun is in its greate&s;t ele|vation;
and &s;corching heats in <HI>July,</HI> when
it is gone &s;ome di&s;tance from them; it is
therefore &s;ome other cau&s;e than its Proxi|mity
that heats the Earth. It happens
very often in its entire ab&s;ence, even at
night, the heat is much greater than in
the day, when it is pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>A&s;tralians,</HI> they
know not what Rain is in this Country, no
more than in <HI>Africa:</HI> Nor do they ever
hear any Thunders &amp; 'tis but very rarely
that they &s;ee any fleeting C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ouds. There
is neither Flyes, nor Caterpillars, nor any

which are not to be met with in any

<P>I was per&s;waded in the Condition I &s;aw my
&s;elf reduced to, that to di&s;&s;emble was to expo&s;e
my Life, wherefore I thought I was oblig'd to
an&s;wer &s;incerely, and without giving him any cau&s;e
of di&s;tru&s;t: I gave him therefore a particular ac|count
of my Countrey according to the Rules of
<HI>Geography:</HI> I made him under&s;tand the great Con|tinent
we dwell in, to which we give the Name
of <HI>Europe and Africa;</HI> I extended my Di&s;cour&s;e
at large upon the different kinds of Animals,
which tho&s;e Countries produce; and this good
Man admired nothing more than what we the
mo&s;t di&s;pi&s;e, <HI>Flyes, In&s;ects, and Worms, &amp;c.</HI> And
could not apprehend how &s;uch little Animals cou'd
enjoy Life and arbitrary Motion. I made him a
particular recital of the &s;everal things they were
nouri&s;hed by; from whence he concluded by a
Rea&s;oning, which our be&s;t Phy&s;itians have not
been ignorant of, that it was impo&s;&s;ible that we
&s;hould be long liv'd. In which I agreed with
him, and a&s;&s;ured him 'twas very rare to &s;ee any
per&s;on among&s;t us arrive to <HI>an hundred years of
<PB N="67" REF="39">
Age,</HI> but that Nature had &s;eem'd &s;ufficiently to
provide for this defect, by means of Generation,
whereby one Man and one Woman were able to
beget ten or twelve Children. He &s;lightly pa&s;|&s;ed
by this matter, pu&s;hed on with impatience
he had to hear me upon others. I confe&s;t to
him that both Sexes in one per&s;on was &s;o rare
among&s;t the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that &s;uch as happen'd
to be born &s;o, pa&s;t for Mon&s;ters among&s;t them;
and as for rea&s;oning, I a&s;&s;ur'd him that al|mo&s;t
every one was taught it, and that there
were publick Lectures made in many places. The
Old Man interrupted me then. <HI>Thou advance&s;t
too much,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>take heed thou do&s;t not
cut thy &s;elf off, mingle not Contradictions with thy
Relations; thou can&s;t never reconcile the u&s;e of Rea&s;on
with the exclu&s;ion of both Sexes in one per&s;on; and what
thou adde&s;t, that many rea&s;on among you, and that they
make publick Lectures in divers places, proves only
that rea&s;oning is bani&s;hed from you.</HI> The fir&s;t fruit
of rea&s;oning is to know, and this knowledge on
nece&s;&s;ity carries us to two things. The fir&s;t, that
to be Man it is nece&s;&s;ary to be entire and com|pleat.
The &s;econd, that to this end it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to be able to rea&s;on upon every thing
that pre&s;ents it &s;elf to us. Your pretended Men
have not the fir&s;t, &s;ince they are all imperfect;
nor have they the &s;econd, &s;ince there's &s;o few
among&s;t them able to Rea&s;on. Can&s;t thou &s;ay
any thing again&s;t the&s;e Con&s;equences? I an&s;wer'd
him, that Rea&s;on taught us a Being was perfect
when it wanted nothing that Con&s;tituted its Na|ture,
and that therefore to add to it what good
things another po&s;&s;e&s;t, would not render it more
perfect, but rather make it Mon&s;trous. <HI>The Light
of the Sun is</HI> an admirable thing, <HI>added I,</HI> There
is nothing more beautiful than this <HI>Charming
Creature,</HI> by which we &s;ee all others, yet it could
<PB N="68" REF="40">
never be prudent to &s;ay, that Man was perfect
becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;t not this Rich Trea&s;ure of Light?
It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore fir&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h what Con|&s;titues
the Nature and Perfection of Man, then
we mu&s;t certainly agree, and may Judge infallibly
of tho&s;e that are perfect, and &s;uch as are defec|tive.
Thou Argue&s;t Ju&s;tly, replyed the <HI>Old Man,</HI>
I'll convince thee therefore by thy own Principles.
Thou knowe&s;t a&s;&s;uredly that Man is made of two
things, a Body more perfect then that of other
Animals, and a <HI>mind more Clear and Bright;</HI> the per|fection
of the Body employs every thing that a
Body may and can contain without deformity;
and that of the Mind requires a knowledge
that extends to what ever can be known, or at
lea&s;t a faculty of rea&s;oning which may conduce
to this extent of Knowledge. Tell me then, is
there not more perfection in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;olely
what compo&s;es a Humane Body then in being
endowed but with one half thereof? Now it
it certain, that both Sexes are nece&s;&s;ary for the
perfection of an entire Man. Wherefore I have
rea&s;on to &s;ay tho&s;e that have but one, are im|perfect.
To which I an&s;wered, that we ought
to con&s;ider Man as other Animals in re&s;pect to
his Body, and that as an Animal cannot be cal|led
imperfect in its kind, becau&s;e it is but of
one Sex, &s;o ever we cannot rea&s;onably &s;ay, that
Man is imperfect, becau&s;e he al&s;o is but of one.
And that on the contrary, the confu&s;ion of Sex|es
in the &s;ame per&s;on, ought rather to pa&s;s for
a Mon&s;trous thing, then for a degree of per|fection.
Thy Manner of Arguing <HI>an&s;wer'd he</HI>
&s;uppo&s;es you to be Ju&s;t, as I pre&s;ume you are, that
is, <HI>Beasts;</HI> and if I cannot ab&s;olutely &s;ay you
are &s;uch, tis becau&s;e there remains upon you
&s;ome Marks of Humanity; and as you &s;eem to
keep a kind of medium between Man and Bea&s;t,
<PB N="69" REF="40">
I believe I do you no injury in calling you <HI>half-Men.</HI>
As to what thou &s;aye&s;t added he, that we are
like to Bea&s;ts in re&s;pect to our Bodies, 'tis a ve|ry
great error to di&s;tingui&s;h as thou do&s;t between
the mind of Man and his Body; the Union of
the&s;e two parts are after &s;uch a manner that one
is comprehended in the other; &s;o that all the
Powers imaginable cannot take any thing from
Man, no not even from his Body, which is &s;o ab|&s;olutely
Humane, that it can never agree with that
of a Bea&s;t; and by con&s;equence Man in what&s;oever
belongs to him, is perfectly di&s;tinct from Bea&s;t.
My Old Man in this place &s;eeing that I had a
great de&s;ire to make &s;ome reply, permitted me:
Therefore &s;aid I to him, <HI>can it be deny'd that Man
agrees with the Beast in what regards Matter, where|of
the Bodies of each were formed? Is it not equally
&s;aid of both, that they feel, they cry, and perform all
the operations of their Sen&s;es? Yes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it may
be deny'd, and I formally do it.</HI></P>
<P>Man has nothing as Man, that agrees with
the Bea&s;t; all the Chymerical Conceptions where|with
thou entertaine&s;t thy &s;elf are only defects of
thy rea&s;oning, which unites what cannot be joyn'd
together, and di&s;unities what is in&s;eparable; for
Example, when we &s;ay that Body in general equal|ly
re&s;pects Man and Bea&s;t; we mean that the word
Body may be equally applyed to both, becau&s;e
of &s;ome Analogy there is in Common between
them, yet however there is always a mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential
difference between them. A Bea&s;t hath
perfect Conformity only with another Bea&s;t, and
that becau&s;e their Sexes are &s;eparate, upon which
account it is nece&s;&s;ary, that they reunite for the
propagation of their kind; But this Union can
never be &s;o perfect to make two Animals one
perfect Being; neither can they continue long
together, without being obliged to a Separation.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="41">
Wherefore it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;eek again
anew for them&s;elves, and they live in a kind of
Langui&s;hment while they are di&s;tant one from a|nother.
<HI>As for us,</HI> added he, <HI>we are entire Men;
wherefore we live without being &s;en&s;ible of any of
the&s;e Animal Ardours one for another, and we cannot
hear them &s;poke of without horrour: Our Love has
nothing Carnal, nor Brutall in it; we are &s;uf|ficiently
&s;atisfyed in our &s;elves, we have no need to
&s;eek any happine&s;s from without, and live contented,
as you &s;ee we do.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd not hear this man &s;peak without reflect|ing
on that great Principle of our Philo&s;ophy; that
the <HI>more perfect a Being is,</HI> the le&s;s need it has
of any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from without.</P>
<P>I made &s;ome Reflections upon the Operations
of the Sovereign Being: I concluded a Creature
cou'd not better re&s;emble him, then in acting &s;im|ply
and alone like him, in all its Producti|ons;
and that an Action which was perform'd by
the concour&s;e of two per&s;ons, cou'd not be &s;o per|fect
as that which was made by one only. My
Old Man perceived by the Su&s;pen&s;ion of my
mind, that I began to be pleas'd with his Rea&s;ons;
wherefore laying a&s;ide the re&s;t of his Arguments,
and changing the di&s;cour&s;e, demanded of me, that
in ca&s;e two per&s;ons concurr'd in the production of
the &s;ame Child, to which of them it belong'd to by
right. I an&s;wer'd him equally to both; and al|ledg'd
the example of many Animals, who made
it appear by their reciprocal cares, that their
young ones belong'd in&s;eparably to each. But he
with indignation rejected the example of Animals,
and told me, <HI>he would have no further Conference with
me, except I wou'd omit making any farther u&s;e of it;
becau&s;e by that I confirmed him,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>what he in|tended
to prove to me, that our production &s;avour'd more
of Bea&s;t than man,</HI> and therefore he might with
<PB N="71" REF="41">
ju&s;tice look upon us as Half-Men. He added, <HI>that
this Mutual and indivi&s;ible Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was lyable to
great difficulties, becau&s;e the Will of two cou'd never be
&s;o regulated, but one wou'd wi&s;h &s;ometimes what was
contrary to the other, which wou'd undoubtedly produce
many Conte&s;tations.</HI> To which I an&s;wer'd, <HI>There was
great &s;ubordination in this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that the Mo|ther
and Child were both &s;ubject to the Father;</HI> but the
word Father being wholly unknown to the <HI>Austra|lians,</HI>
I was obliged to expre&s;s it in &s;uch terms
as he might mo&s;t probably under&s;tand me; he
made me repeat it to him three times, and lea&s;t
he &s;hou'd not apprehend me, he explain'd to me
what Idea he had conceiv'd of it: After which he
was entirely per&s;uaded of the common opinion of
the <HI>Australians,</HI> that we cou'd not be Men, and
cryed to him&s;elf with an extraordinary &s;everity,
<HI>O where is Judgment? Where is Rea&s;on? Where is the
Man? Where is the Man?</HI> which he repeated three
times; I told him, <HI>The Laws of the Country deter|mined
it &s;o, and that it was not without foundation, &s;ince
the Father being the Principle cau&s;e of Generation, it was
to him, that the I&s;&s;ue that might be produced, ought prin|cipally
to belong.</HI></P>
<P>Let us di&s;cour&s;e in order upon this matter, &s;aid
he, <HI>Thou hast advanced that the Father and Mother act
together to produce it; thou hast made me apprehend, that
the Mother is the mo&s;t nearly concern'd in it; from whence
is it then that thou conclude&s;t the Father ought to be
lookt upon as the Principle Cau&s;e? If there is a pre|cedency,
why give&s;t thou it to the Father, &s;ince the Mo|ther
&s;eems to me to have the greate&s;t &s;hare in it? Wou'd
it not be more rea&s;onable to look upon this pretended
Father as the accidental Cau&s;e, and the Mother, with|out
whom it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hou'd have Being, as the
natural and chief Cau&s;e? But tell me freely, Is this
Mother &s;o tyed to the Father, that &s;he cannot unite
her &s;elf with any other Man?</HI> I an&s;wered him with
<PB N="72" REF="42">
a great deal of &s;incerity, <HI>That it was not only po&s;|&s;ible,
but that it often happened.</HI> If &s;o replied he, in|terrupting
me, <HI>He that takes the Title of Father can
never be certain he is effectively &s;o; nothing is more ri|diculous
therefore, than to look upon him as Principal
Cau&s;e, who has concurr'd in the producing a Child,
&s;ince it is always uncertain, whether it was his or no;
and you cannot without Inju&s;tice take this Quality from
that of the two per&s;ons that you call Mother, to &s;peak ju&s;t|ly
of things as they are in them&s;elves.</HI> I found my &s;elf
&s;hock't by the Di&s;cour&s;e of this Old man; and al|tho
I cou'd not con&s;ent to his Rea&s;on, which over|turn'd
all our Laws, I cou'd not hinder my &s;elf
from making a thou&s;and Reflections, and confe&s;&s;ing
that they treated that Sex with too much &s;everity,
from whom all Mankind receiv'd &s;o many obliga|tions:
My thoughts furni&s;hed me then with an
hundred rea&s;ons to maintain what my Philo&s;o|pher
had a&s;&s;erted; I found my &s;elf forc'd to be|lieve
that this great power which man had u&s;urped
over Woman, was rather the effect of an odious
Tyranny, than a Legitimate Authority.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of my propo&s;ition being found
void, we entred upon the &s;econd, which was in
re&s;pect to the under&s;tanding of the <HI>Europeans;</HI>
but my Old Man &s;poke of it very briefly, think|ing
I had &s;aid all that I cou'd upon the fir&s;t head.
<HI>I doubt no longer now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what you</HI> Europe|ans
<HI>are, it is a point which is fully clear'd. Never|thele&s;s,</HI>
added he, <HI>as it cannot be deny'd, but thou ha&s;t
&s;hewn &s;omething extraordinary both in thy Courage and
Rea&s;oning; &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary that I know from whence
it might proceed: I a&s;&s;ured him, that what he had
&s;een me do in the Combat, was rather an effect of
my di&s;pair than courage: That we had no &s;uch Fools
to engage with among&s;t us, but that Men fought
&s;ometimes amongst them&s;elves, till they had utterly
<PB N="73" REF="42">
de&s;troy'd one another. They are
exactly like the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A kind of <HI>Barba|rians</HI> who border'd upon the <HI>Au&s;tra|lians.</HI></NOTE> Fondins,
&s;aid he, <HI>and as I was going to
proceed: Thou hast,</HI> added he,
<HI>been with us long enough to
know us, and to be per&s;wa|ded
of the Wi&s;dom of our Conduct.</HI> This word Man
which carries with it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a con&s;equence
of Rea&s;on and Humanity, obliges us to an Uni|on
which is &s;o perfect among&s;t us, that we know
not what Divi&s;ion and Di&s;cord is; wherefore thou
mu&s;t confe&s;s, either that we are more than Men,
or that we are le&s;s than Men, &s;ince that you are
&s;o far from our perfection. To which I an&s;wer'd
it could not be deny'd but that the divers Cli|mates
contributed much to the different In|clinations
of their Inhabitants; that from thence
it happen'd, that &s;ome were more eager, others
more calm, &s;ome dull, others quick, which diver|&s;ity
of Temperaments was the ordinary cau&s;e of
Divi&s;ions, Wars, and all other Di&s;&s;entions, which
arm Men again&s;t one another; but he laught at
this Rea&s;on, maintaining, That man as man, could
never cea&s;e to be man, that is, humane, rea&s;onable,
affable, without pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e 'tis in this,
that the nature of man con&s;i&s;ts; and as the Sun
cannot be a Sun when it does not give light; &s;o a
man cannot be a man but he mu&s;t differ e&s;&s;entially
from Bea&s;ts, in whom Madne&s;s, Gluttony, Cruelty,
and other Vices and Pa&s;&s;ions are a con&s;equence of
their imperfect and defective Nature, that the who
was the Subject of the&s;e Defaults, was no more than
a vain and deceitful Image of a Man, or rather a
true Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, that I could not hearken to this Di&s;|cour&s;e
without admiration! and nothing ever edi|fyed
me more than this purity of Morals, in&s;pir'd
by the only light of Nature and Rea&s;on. My Phi|lo&s;opher
<PB N="74" REF="43">
having ask'd me what I thought of that
way of Rea&s;oning? I an&s;wered, <HI>That indeed my
mind had been cultivated by Study, and that nothing was
omitted in my Education, that might carefully inform my
Judgment.</HI> Upon which he demanded, if the like
care was not equally taken throughout the World,
and having an&s;wered that indeed, he had more to
&s;ay upon that point; he included after his common
manner; this Irregularity caus'd many di&s;orders,
di&s;putes, heats and complaints, becau&s;e he that
knew lea&s;t (&s;eeing others above him which knew
more) e&s;teem'd him&s;elf the more unhappy, that
Birth had made all alike. <HI>As for us,</HI> added he, <HI>we
make a Profe&s;&s;ion of being all Equal, Our glory con&s;i&s;ts in
being all alike, and to be dignify'd with the &s;ame Care,
and in the &s;ame manner; all the difference that there is,
is only in the divers Exerci&s;es to which we apply our
&s;elves, &s;o as to find out new Inventions, that the Di&s;|coverers
may contribute them to the Publick Good.</HI>
After this, he &s;poke to me of <HI>Habits,</HI> which he
call'd Superfluities among&s;t the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and
I a&s;&s;ur'd him, that they had as great an horror
among&s;t them to &s;ee a Per&s;on Naked, as the
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> had to &s;ee them in Cloaths; I al|ledg'd
for Rea&s;ons of this u&s;e, Mode&s;ty, the Ri|gour
of the Sea&s;on and Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>To this, as I remember, he an&s;wered, <HI>That cu&s;tom
&s;o much prevails upon your minds, that one would believe
every thing nece&s;&s;ary that you practice from your Birth,
and that you can't change a Cu&s;tom without as great a
violence as changing your own Nature.</HI> I replyed, by
in&s;i&s;ting upon the Rea&s;on of divers Climates,
and told him, <HI>That there were &s;ome Countries among&s;t
the</HI> Europeans, <HI>where the Cold was in&s;upportable to
the Body, which was more delicate than that of the</HI> Au&s;t|ralians,
<HI>and that there were &s;ome that even dy'd upon
it, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Cloaths:</HI>
In fine, I told him, <HI>That the weakne&s;s of the nature</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="43">
<HI>of either Sex was &s;uch, that there was no looking upon
one that was</HI> Naked without Blu&s;hing, and Shame,
<HI>and without being &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch Emotions, as</HI> Mode&s;ty
<HI>oblig'd me to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is there a Con&s;equence in all that thou ha&s;t advanc'd</HI>
(&s;aid he) <HI>and from whence can this custom come? Is not
this to father upon all the world what is contrary to Na|ture?
We are</HI> Born Naked, <HI>and we can't be cover'd
without believing that 'tis &s;hameful to be &s;een as we are;
but as to what thou &s;ay'&s;t concerning the</HI> Rigour of the
Sea&s;ons, <HI>I can't, nay, I ought not to give any credit to
it; for if this Country is &s;o in&s;upportable, what is it
that obliges him that knows what Rea&s;on is, to make it
his Country? mu&s;t not he be more &s;illy than a Beast, that
will tarry in tho&s;e places where the Air is mortal
at certain Sea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>When Nature makes an Animal, it gives him
the liberty of Motion to &s;eek what is good and a|void
that which is evil. How opinionative then
is man to &s;tay where he is threatned on all &s;ides,
and where he mu&s;t be in a Continual Torment to
pre&s;erve him&s;elf? Certainly he mu&s;t have lo&s;t all
his &s;en&s;es, if ever he had any; as for the weakne&s;s
which thou calls <HI>Modesty,</HI> I have nothing to &s;ay to
it, &s;ince thou confe&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;o much &s;incerity
that it is a fault, 'tis truly a great weakne&s;s which
will not permit us to look upon one another with
re&s;enting the <HI>Brutal Motions</HI> which thou &s;peake&s;t of.
Bea&s;ts continually &s;ee them&s;elves and one another,
but this &s;ight cau&s;es no alteration in them: How
then can you who believe your &s;elves of a Superior
order to them be more weak than they? or el&s;e
it mu&s;t be that your Sight is weaker than that
of Animals, &s;ince you can't &s;ee through a &s;ingle
<HI>Covering</HI> what is under; for there are &s;ome of them
that can even penetrate through a Wall; this is
all that I can Judge of tho&s;e of thy Country, becau&s;e
thou telle&s;t me they have &s;ome <HI>Sparks of Rea&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="44">
but they are &s;o weak, that in&s;tead of enlightning
them, they only &s;erve to conduct 'em more &s;urely
in their Error. If 'tis true that their Country is
inhabitable, at lea&s;t that they make u&s;e of <HI>Cloath
and Covering</HI> for the ends thou ha&s;t mention'd,
they are ju&s;t like tho&s;e per&s;ons who in&s;tead of get|ting
away from an Evident danger, rea&s;on finely
how they may pre&s;erve them&s;elves, by covering
them&s;elves without avoiding the occa&s;ion; but if
it be true that Cloaths render you wi&s;e in the Eyes
of one onother, I know not how to compare you
better than to little Children who no more know
an Object when once it is vail'd.</P>
<P>As for me I rather believe that 'tis deformity
among&s;t you which made you fir&s;t invent cloathing,
and that it not only authorizes it now but al&s;o conti|nues
it; for there is nothing in a Man <HI>finer than
him&s;elf</HI> when he is without defects, and has all the
Natural Qualities which concur to his entire per|fection.</P>
<P>I harkned to this man rather as an <HI>Oracle</HI> than
a Philo&s;opher; all the propo&s;itions which he advan|ced
were backt with &s;uch <HI>Invincible Rea&s;oning.</HI> He
&s;aid no more on this point, but without giving me
time to an&s;wer, he pa&s;t to that of Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I early perceived that he knew no more of it
but the Name, for having de&s;ired him to explain
what he ment by it, I under&s;tood that his Idea
of it, was a <HI>weakne&s;s of mind,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted in
heaping up fine things without any profit.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> for&s;ake &s;omethings that are
nece&s;&s;ary for their entertainment, but they know
not what it is to heap up, nor to keep any thing
again&s;t <HI>to Morrow,</HI> and their manner of living thus
may pa&s;s for a <HI>Perfect Image of the State
that man at fir&s;t enjoyed in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Ambition,</HI> he had a gro&s;s Idea of it;
but he defin'd it a de&s;ire of mens being elevat|ed
above others.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="44">
I told him that in <HI>Europe</HI> they held it for a
Maxim, that the <HI>Multitude</HI> without any order begat
confu&s;ion, in which there was no gu&s;t of the good
things in Life, and that Order &s;uppos'd a <HI>Head,</HI>
to which all others were &s;ubject. From hence the
Old Man took occa&s;ion to explain a Doctrine, of
which I indeed conceiv'd the meaning; but 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
to di&s;cover the Knowledge of it to others
in &s;o &s;trong and powerful terms as the&s;e which he
made u&s;e of to make me under&s;tand it. He &s;aid,
that it was the Nature of Man <HI>to be born and live free,</HI>
and that therefore he could not be Subjected with|out
being di&s;poil'd of his Nature; and that in &s;uch
a &s;ubjection Man was made to de&s;cend below Bea&s;ts,
becau&s;e a Bea&s;t being only made for the &s;ervice of
Man, <HI>Subjection was after &s;ome manner Natural to it.</HI>
But one man could not be born for the &s;ervice of
another Man; a Con&s;traint in this Ca&s;e would
be a &s;ort of violence which would even degrade a
Man after a certain manner from his proper Exi&s;t|ence;
he enlarged much to prove that the Sub|jection
of one Man to another was a Subjection of
the humane Nature, and making a Man a <HI>&s;ort of
Slave to him&s;elf,</HI> which Slavery implyed &s;uch a
Contradiction and violence as was impo&s;&s;ible to
conceive. He added that the <HI>E&s;&s;ence of Man con|&s;isting
in Liberty,</HI> it could not be taken away with|out
de&s;troying him, and therefore he that would
take away anothers Liberty, did tacitly bid him to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t without his own E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>Our Conference la&s;ted above <HI>four hours,</HI> and if
the hour of publick A&s;&s;embly had not interrupted
as, we were in a di&s;po&s;ition to have di&s;cours'd
much longer. I entred the <HI>Hab</HI> with a mind full of
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the rea&s;oning which I had heard, admiring the
Knowledge and great Light wherewith this People
were endu'd. The &s;trength of this Mans Rea&s;ons
<HI>&s;u&s;pended my Sen&s;es,</HI> and I pa&s;t the time of this A&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="78" REF="45">
in a kind of an A&s;toni&s;hment; it &s;eem'd to
me that <HI>I &s;aw things after another Fa&s;hion than before:</HI>
I was for above Eight Hours, as it were forc'd to
make continual Compari&s;ons <HI>betwixt what I was,
and what I &s;aw; I could not but admire a Conduct &s;o
appo&s;ite to our defective one, that</HI> I <HI>was a&s;ham'd to re|member
how far we were from the perfection of the&s;e
People.</HI> I &s;aid in my &s;elf, can it be true that we are
not all made Men? but, added I, <HI>If it is not &s;o, what
is the difference of the&s;e People from us? They are by the
ordinary state of Life elevated to a pitch of a Vertue
which we cannot attain but by the greatest efforts of our
mo&s;t noble Ideas. Our best Morality is not capable of
better Rea&s;oning,</HI> nor more exactne&s;s, than what
they practice Naturally without Rules, and with|out
Precepts; this <HI>&V;nion which nothing can alter, this
di&s;tance from Worldly Goods, this inviolable Purity;</HI>
in a word, this adherence to &s;trict Rea&s;on, which
unites them among&s;t them&s;elves, and carries them
to what is good and ju&s;t, can't but be the <HI>Fruits of
a con&s;ummate Vertue,</HI> than which we can con|ceive
nothing more perfect; but on the contrary,
how many Vices and Imperfections are we not &s;ub|ject
to? <HI>This in&s;atiable thirst after Riches, the&s;e con|tinual
di&s;&s;entions, the&s;e black Trea&s;ons, bloody Con&s;pi|racies,
and cruel Butcheries,</HI> which we are continu|ally
exerci&s;ing towards one another; don't the&s;e
things force us to acknowledge that we are guided
by Pa&s;&s;ion rather than Rea&s;on? Is it not to be
wi&s;ht that in this E&s;tate, one of the&s;e Men
which we may call <HI>Barbarians</HI> would come to
di&s;abu&s;e us, <HI>and appear in &s;o much Vertue as they
practice purely by their Natural Light,</HI> to confound
the Vanity which we draw from our pretend|ed

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion of the <HI>Au&s;tralians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is no Subject more curious and &s;ecret
among the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> than that of their
Religion; 'tis a crime of Innovation even to &s;peak
of it, either by Di&s;pute or a Form of Explana|tion;
even the Mothers do with the fir&s;t Principles
of Knowledge, in&s;pire into the Child that of the
<HI>Hab,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>incomprehen&s;ible.</HI> They believe
that this Incomprehen&s;ible Being is every where,
and they have all imaginable Veneration for him,
but they recommend carefully to the young Men to
Adore him always, without &s;peaking of him, and
they are per&s;waded that it was a very great Crime,
to make his Divine Perfections the Subject of their
Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;o that one may in a manner &s;ay, that
their great Religion is not to &s;peak of Religion. As
I had been brought up in Maxims very different
from theirs, I could have no gu&s;t in a Wor&s;hip
without Ceremonies, nor accommodate my &s;elf to
a Religion where I never heard the Name of God
mentioned. This cau&s;ed great di&s;quiet in me for
&s;ome time, but at length I di&s;cover'd my troubles
to my Old Phylo&s;opher, who having heard me,
took me by the hand, and conducting me into a
Walk; he &s;aid to me with a very gave Air, <HI>Is it
po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be more a Man in the knowledge
of the</HI> Hab <HI>than in your other Actions; open thy Heart,
and I promi&s;e thee to conceal nothing from thee.</HI> I was
ravi&s;ht to find &s;uch a favourable opportunity to
learn the particular Faith of the&s;e People: I then
told my Old Man, that we had two &s;orts of the
Knowledge of God in <HI>Europe,</HI> the one Natural, the
other &s;upernatural. Nature in&s;tructed us that there
<PB N="80" REF="46">
was a Soveraign Being, the Author and Pre&s;er|ver
of all things: I can &s;ee this Truth, <HI>added I,</HI>
with my Eyes, <HI>when I behold the Earth view tbe Hea|vens,
or reflect upon my &s;elf;</HI> when I &s;ee &s;uch things
as are not made but by a Superiour Cau&s;e, I am
obliged to acknowledge and adore a Being, which
cannot be made, and which made all things el&s;e.
When <HI>I</HI> con&s;ider my &s;elf, <HI>I</HI> am a&s;&s;ured that <HI>I</HI> could
not be without a beginning, therefore it follows,
that a per&s;on like me would not give me to be,
and by con&s;equence this puts me upon &s;eeking out
a fir&s;t Being, who having had no Beginning, mu&s;t
be the Original of all other things. When my
Rea&s;on conducted me to this fir&s;t Principle, <HI>I</HI>
concluded evidently, that this Being cannot be
limited, becau&s;e limits &s;uppo&s;e a nece&s;&s;ity of pro|duction
and dependance.</P>
<P>The Old Man interrupting my di&s;cour&s;e in my
la&s;t words, told me with many <HI>fine Remarks,</HI>
that if our <HI>Europeans</HI> could form this rea&s;oning, they
were not altogether depriv'd of the mo&s;t &s;olid
Knowledge; <HI>I always rea&s;oned thus with my &s;elf,</HI>
added he, <HI>as thou hast done, and altho' the way
of ariving to this Truth by the&s;e kind of Reflecti|ons,
be extreamly long, yet I am per&s;waded that 'tis
fea&s;ible. I confe&s;s neverthele&s;s that the great Revo|lutions
of many thou&s;and Ages may have cau&s;ed
great Alteration in what we &s;ee; but my Mind
permits me not from hence either to conceive an
Eternity, or apprehend a General production with|out
the</HI> Conduct of a Soveraign Being,
who is the Supream Governour; for
this would be an Abu&s;e upon him, and
<HI>charge him with Error amongst a thou&s;and Re|volutions,
if we averr that all we &s;ee, happned by the
fortuitous rancounters which have had no other princi|ples
but that of local motion and the ju&s;tling together of
little &s;mall Bodies. This is to perplex one's &s;elf in &s;uch</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="46">
<HI>difficulties as we can never re&s;olve, and to put us in dan|ger
of committing an Execrable Bla&s;phemy; this is to give
to the Creature what belongs to the Creator, and by
con&s;equence to repay him with an in&s;upportable in|gratitude
to whom we are obliged for what we are
and have, Even at what time we conceive that the
Eternity of Atoms is po&s;&s;ible; it is certain the contra|ry
opinion is no le&s;s, not to &s;ay more probable. This
would be as wilful a Crime as to admit that Atoms
are capable of &s;entiment and knowledge.</HI> 'Twas
the&s;e Con&s;iderations that oblig'd us about 45
Revolutions &s;ince, to &s;uppo&s;e a fir&s;t Being, and
to teach it as the foundation of all our Principles,
without &s;uffering that any one &s;hould teach any
Doctrine which &s;hould oppo&s;e this Truth. I hark|ned
to the di&s;cour&s;e of this Man, with all the atten|tion
that I was capable of; the Grace with which
he &s;poke, and the weight which he gave to his
words, per&s;waded me no le&s;s than his rea&s;ons; but
as I &s;aw he was about to ask me a new Que&s;tion, I
prevented him, and &s;aid, <HI>That altho one &s;hou'd grant
the Eternity of the&s;e little Bodies, we have &s;poken of,</HI> yet
they <HI>could never frame this World, and diver&s;ify it as
we now &s;ee it, according to this indi&s;putable principle;
things continuing in the &s;ame State, cannot produce other
things different from them.</HI> Thus the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI> having no
difference among&s;t them&s;elves but Number and plu|rality,
could only make formle&s;s Heaps, and of that
&s;ame Quality with them&s;elves. <HI>That which is mo&s;t
difficult to certain mind,</HI> (&s;aid he,) <HI>is the great Ob&s;truc|tion
of this Being of Beings, which is no more di&s;coverable
than if he was not at all; but I found this rea&s;on of little
weight, becau&s;e we have many others which oblige us to
believe that he is too far above us to manifest him&s;elf to
us otherwi&s;e than by his works; If his Condust was par|ticular,
I &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to per&s;wade my &s;elf that it
was his, &s;ince an univer&s;al Being ought to act after an
univer&s;al manner.</HI></P>

Prayers to call upon him, and Prai&s;es to Glorify
him with, and his Commandments to keep;
you &s;peak very freely of that <HI>Hab,</HI> &s;aid he, inter|rupting
me; yes without doubt an&s;wered I, tis a
Subject mo&s;t agreeable and entertaining to us, for
we ought to find nothing more delightful, than to
&s;peak of him on whom we ab&s;olutely depend for
Life and Death; nothing is more ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ince 'tis by this only that we can Execute our re|membrance
of him, and our reverence towards
him.</P>
<P>There is nothing more rea&s;onable than that, re|ply'd
he; but are your opinions the &s;ame touching
this <HI>incomprehen&s;ible.</HI> There's a few, an&s;wered I, which
think not the &s;ame, in relation to Sovereign per|fections.
<HI>Tell me po&s;&s;itively and clearly,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>with
eagerne&s;s, what do your</HI> rea&s;onings upon this Divine
Being liken him to? I confe&s;t &s;incerely that our o|pinions
were divided in the conclu&s;ions which e|very
one often drew from the &s;ame principles: this
cau&s;es many &s;harp <HI>contestations</HI> from whence there
often ari&s;es the mo&s;t envenom'd Hatreds, and &s;ome|times
even bloody Wars, and at other times Con|&s;equences
no le&s;s fatal.</P>
<P>This good Old Man replyed very briskly,
that if <HI>I</HI> had made any other An&s;wer, he
would have had no further Conference with
me, but &s;hould have had the greate&s;t Contempt
for me; for, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> 'tis mo&s;t certain that
<HI>Men cannot &s;peak of any thing thats incomprehen|&s;ible,
without having divers Opinions of it;</HI> nay
even &s;uch as are even contrary one to ano|ther.
<PB N="83" REF="47">
One mu&s;t be blind, <HI>added he,</HI> to be ig|norant
of a fir&s;t Principle, but one mu&s;t be
<HI>Infinite like him,</HI> to be able to &s;peak exactly
of it; for &s;ince we know it is Incomprehen|&s;ible,
it naturally follows, that we can only
&s;peak of it by conjecture; and that all that
may be &s;aid on the Subject, may perhaps
content the Curious, but can never &s;atisfy
the Rea&s;onable Man. And we better approve of
an <HI>ab&s;olute &s;ilence in the Matter,</HI> than to expo&s;e
our &s;elves by putting off a many fal&s;e Notions
concerning the Nature of a Being, which is
elevated &s;o very much above our Under&s;tand|ings.
We A&s;&s;emble therefore together in the
<HI>Hab,</HI> only to acknowledge his Supream great|ne&s;s,
and adore his Soveraign Power, and leave
<HI>each Per&s;on to their liberty of thinking what they
plea&s;e:</HI> But we have made an Inviolable Law,
never to &s;peak of him, for fear of engaging
our &s;elves by di&s;cour&s;e in &s;uch Errors as
might offend him. I leave it to the Learned
to judge of a Conduct &s;o extraordinary as
this is, <HI>never to &s;peak in any manner of God.</HI>
All that I can &s;ay of it is, it impre&s;&s;es on the
Mind an admirable <HI>re&s;pect for Divine things,</HI> and
produces among&s;t us &s;uch an Union, of which
we meet with no Example any where el&s;e.
As I perceived the hour of <HI>Hab,</HI> would &s;oon
oblige us to part, &s;o I pre&s;t him the more
earne&s;tly to tell me what were the Opinions
of the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> concerning the <HI>Nature of
the Soul;</HI> wherefore he explain'd to me their
Notions upon this Subject, but he did it in
&s;o elevated a manner, that I could retain but
little that he &s;aid to me of it, altho' whil&s;t
he was &s;peaking, I after &s;ome manner or other
apprehended all his Idea's.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="48">
The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of their Opinions touching
Matter, as near as I can remember, runs upon
the Doctrine of an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Genius,</HI> which com|municates
it &s;elf in part to each particular per|&s;on,
and which has the Vertue when any one

&s;ince it only waits for <HI>New Organs,</HI> and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Opinion of the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> touch|ing

<P>I Have only three things to remark upon the
Sentiments of the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> concerning the
pre&s;ent Life: The fir&s;t is in re&s;pect to the
beginning; the &s;econd, the continuation thereof;
and the third, the end. Their manner of re|ceiving
Life, pre&s;erving and ending it.</P>
<P>I have already declared, in what manner the
<HI>Australians</HI> come into the world; but as it is one
of the principal points of this Hi&s;tory, &s;o I be|lieve
my &s;elf obliged yet to &s;ay &s;omething more
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="48">
They have &s;o great an aver&s;ion for what&s;o|ever
regards the fir&s;t beginning of their Lives,
that in a year or thereabouts after my arrival
among&s;t them, two of the Brethren having heard
me &s;peak &s;omething of it, with-drew from me,
with as many &s;igns of horrour, as if I had com|mitted
&s;ome great Crime. One day when I had
di&s;covered my &s;elf to my Old Philo&s;opher, after
having cen&s;ured me a little upon this Subject, he
entred into a long Di&s;cour&s;e, and brought many
Proofs to oblige me to believe, that Children
grew within them like Fruits upon the Trees;
but when he &s;aw all his rea&s;ons made no im|pre&s;&s;ion
on my mind, and that I cou'd not for|bear
&s;miling, he left me without accompli&s;hing
it, reproaching me that my incredulity proceed|ed
from the corruption of my manners.</P>
<P>It happen'd another time, about &s;ix months af|ter
my arrival, that the extraordinary Care&s;&s;es of
the Brethren, cau&s;ed &s;ome unruly mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ions in me,
which &s;ome of them perceiving, were &s;o very much
&s;candaliz'd at it, that they left me with great in|dignation:
Wherefore I &s;oon became odious to
them all, as I have already &s;aid; and they had in|fallibly
de&s;troy'd me, had it not been for the par|ticular
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this good Old man.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in about thirty two years that I
have lived with them, I cou'd never learn their way
of Generation; yet be it as it will, their Children
have neither the <HI>Meazles</HI> nor <HI>Small Pox,</HI> nor other
the like accidents, which the <HI>Europeans</HI> are &s;ubject
unto.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as an <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> had conceived, he quits
his Apartment, and is carryed to the <HI>Hab,</HI> where he
<PB N="86" REF="49">
is received with Te&s;timonys of an extraordinary
Bounty, and is nouri&s;hed without being oblig'd to
work. They have a certain high place, upon which
they go to bring forth their Child, which is recei|ved
upon certain <HI>Bal&s;amick Leaves;</HI> after which the
Mother (or per&s;on that bore it) takes it and rubs
it with the&s;e Leaves, and gives it &s;uck, without a|ny
appearance of having &s;uffer'd any pain.</P>
<P>They make no u&s;e of Swadling Cloaths, or Crad|les.
The Milk it receives from the Mother, gives
it &s;o good nouri&s;hment, that it &s;uffices it without
any other food for two years: And the Excrements
it voids, are in &s;o &s;mall a quantity, that it may al|mo&s;t
be &s;aid, it makes none. They generally &s;peak
at eight months; they walk at a years end, and at
two they wean them. They begin to rea&s;on at
three; and as &s;oon as the Mother quits them, the
fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of the fir&s;t Company teaches them to
read, and at the &s;ame time in&s;tructs them in the
fir&s;t Elements of a more advanced knowledge. They
u&s;ually are three years under the Conduct of the
fir&s;t Ma&s;ter, and after pa&s;s under the Di&s;cipline of
the &s;econd, who teaches them to write, with whom
they continue four years; and &s;o with the others in
proportion, till they are thirty years of Age, at
which time they are perfect in all &s;orts of Sciences,
without ob&s;erving any difference among&s;t them, ei|ther
for Capacity, Genius, or Learning. When
they have thus accompli&s;h'd the cour&s;e of all their
Studies, they may be cho&s;e for Lieutenants, that is,
to &s;upply the place of tho&s;e that wou'd leave this
Life.</P>
<P>I have in the fifth Chapter &s;poken of their hum|our,
which is mixt with a certain &s;weetne&s;s full of
Gravity, that forms the temperament of the mo&s;t
rea&s;onable men, and &s;uch as are the fitte&s;t for So|ciety.
<PB N="87" REF="49">
They are &s;trong, robu&s;t, and vigorous, and
their Health is never interrupted by the lea&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s.
This admirable Con&s;titution comes without
doubt from their Birth and excellent Nouri&s;hment,
which they always take with moderation; for our
Sickne&s;&s;es are always the con&s;equences of the cor|ruption
of that Blood whereof we are form'd, and
the exce&s;s of the ill Food which we are nouri&s;hed
with. In fine, our Parents generally communicate
to us all the defects that they have contracted by
their irregular Lives; their Intemperance fills us
with &s;uch an abundance of &s;uperfluous Humours,
which de&s;troy us how &s;trong &s;oever we may be, if
we purge not our &s;elves often. It is the exce&s;&s;ive
Heats that they kindle in their Blood by their De|bauches,
which cau&s;e in us &s;uch Ri&s;ings in the Fle&s;h,
and all tho&s;e &s;corbutick Di&s;tempers which &s;pread
throughout the whole Body. Their Choller gives
us a di&s;po&s;ition to the &s;ame Vice, their Wanton|ne&s;s
augments our Concupi&s;cence; in a word, they
make us ju&s;t what we are, becau&s;e they give us
what they have.</P>
<P>The <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> are exempted from all the&s;e
Pa&s;&s;ions; for their Parents never being &s;ubject to
them, cannot communicate 'em; and as they have
no principle of alteration, &s;o they live in a kind of
indifference which they never for&s;ake, except it
be to follow the motions that their rea&s;on impre&s;|&s;es
on them.</P>
<P>We may very near make the &s;ame con&s;equences
touching the nouri&s;hment of the <HI>Au&s;tralians;</HI> for if
the <HI>Europeans</HI> have the misfortune only to have
&s;uch Viands for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence as are unhealthful,
it commonly happens, that they eat more than na|ture
requires: and 'tis the&s;e exce&s;&s;es that cau&s;e in
them &s;uch weak Stomachs, Feavers, and other the
like Infirmities which are wholly unknown to the
<PB N="88" REF="50">
<HI>Australians.</HI> Their admirable Temperance, and
the goodne&s;s of their Fruits, upon which they live,
maintains them in &s;uch a frame of health, as is ne|ver
interrupted by any Sickne&s;s: They are like|wi&s;e
&s;o far from placing any glory in Eating, or
making &s;umptuous Fea&s;ts as we do, that they
hide them&s;elves, and only eat in &s;ecret; they &s;leep
very little, becau&s;e they are per&s;uaded, that Sleep
is too Animal an Action, from which man ought
if it was po&s;&s;ible, wholly to ab&s;tain.</P>
<P>They all agree, that this Life is only a motion
full of trouble and agitation; they are per&s;uaded,
that what we call Death is their Happine&s;s, and that
the greate&s;t good of Mankind is to arrive to this
term, which puts an end to all his pains: from
whence they are indifferent for life, and pa&s;&s;ion|ately
wi&s;h for Death. The more I &s;eem'd to ap|prehend
Death, the more they were confirm'd in
the thought that I cou'd be no man, &s;ince accord|ing
to their Ideas, I &s;inned again&s;t the <HI>fir&s;t Princip|les
of Rea&s;on.</HI> My Old man often times &s;poke to
me of it, and the&s;e are very near the &s;ame rea&s;ons
he gave me; <HI>We differ from Bea&s;ts,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in that
their &V;nder&s;tandings penetrate not into the bottom of
things, they judge of them only by Appearance and Cou|lour.
'Tis from thence they fly their de&s;truction, as the
greatest evil, and endeavour to pre&s;erve them&s;elves as
the greate&s;t Good, not con&s;idering that &s;ince 'tis an ab|&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity that they peri&s;h; all the pains they take to
prevent it, becomes vain and u&s;ele&s;s. Even to argue,</HI>
continued he, <HI>upon what regards us, it is nece&s;&s;ary,
that we &s;hould con&s;ider Life as an E&s;tate of Mi&s;ery,
altho it con&s;ist in the union of a &s;piritual Soul with a
material Body, whereof the Inclinations are perfect|ly
oppo&s;ite the one to the other.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="50">
So that to de&s;ire to live, is to de&s;ire to be
always enduring the violent Shock of
the&s;e oppo&s;itions; and to de&s;ire Death, is
but to a&s;pire to that Re&s;t, which each of
tho&s;e parts enjoys, when they are both
in their Center.</P>
<P>And, as we have nothing <HI>Dearer to us,
than our &s;elves,</HI> added he, nor can look
upon our &s;elves to be any thing el&s;e, but
&s;o many Compounds, who&s;e Di&s;&s;olution
is certain and infallible, we more pro|perly
<HI>langui&s;h than live;</HI> and the ca&s;e
being &s;o with us, would it not be better
for us not to be at all, than to be to no o|ther
purpo&s;e, than to know, that &s;hortly we
&s;hall be no more? The care we take to
pre&s;erve our &s;elves, is to no purpo&s;e,
&s;ince after all, we mu&s;t die at la&s;t. The
con&s;ideration of our <HI>Rare&s;t Talents,</HI> and
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite improvements in Know|ledge,
gives us a <HI>&s;econd torment,</HI> &s;ince we
can look upon them as no other, than
Tran&s;itory Enjoyments, who&s;e acqui&s;iti|on
has co&s;t us a Thou&s;and pains, and yet,
who&s;e lo&s;s it is no way in our power to
prevent. <HI>In fine,</HI> all that we reflect upon,
both <HI>within and without</HI> us, contributes to
render our Life &s;o much the more odious
and in&s;upportable to us.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="51">
I an&s;wered to all that, That in my opi|nion,
the&s;e Arguments proved too much;
and that to give them their full force, it
weuld follow, that I mu&s;t needs be &s;orry
for knowing any thing that &s;urpa&s;&s;es my
Under&s;tanding, which yet is fal&s;e, be|cau&s;e
<HI>the goodne&s;s of Judgment con&s;i&s;ts in
being able to re&s;t content with our condition,</HI>
and to put away tho&s;e trouble&s;ome
Thoughts that &s;erve only to afflict us,
e&s;pecially when we know not how by any
means to remedy them. There is &s;ome|thing
of Solidity in thy an&s;wer, reply|ed
he; but yet it is weak in two particu|lars:
The one is, in &s;uppo&s;ing we are
able to &s;u&s;pend our Judgment; and the
other, in thinking it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould
love our &s;elves without dete&s;ting our Di&s;|&s;olution:
To be able to do the fir&s;t, is
to be able, with open Eyes, not to &s;ee
what is continually before us; and to be
able to do the &s;econd, is, to love to be
&s;omething, without hating to be nothing.
'Tis a great weakne&s;s to imagine, we can
po&s;&s;ibly live, without being deeply affect|ed
with the Sen&s;e of our own De&s;tructi|on;
and 'tis &s;till a greater to torment our
&s;elves with the fear of what we know
will infallibly come upon us: But it is
the <HI>utmo&s;t degree of folly,</HI> to &s;eek after pre|&s;ervatives,
<PB N="99" REF="51">
in order to avoid what we
know to be ab&s;olutely inavoidable. To
be able to live without the Sen&s;e of
Death, is to be able to live without know|ing
any thing of our &s;elves, &s;ince Death
is in&s;eparable from our Nature; and that
to con&s;ider our &s;elves, in all our &s;everal
parts, is to &s;ee we have nothing but what
is mortal in us. To be capable of fearing
Death, &s;uppo&s;es us able to reconcile two
Contradictions, &s;ince to fear, &s;uppo&s;es
&s;ome doubt in us, whether what we fear
will happen or no, and that we certain|ly
know we &s;hall infallibly die, and it is
&s;till more ab&s;urd to go about to take any
Pre&s;ervatives, to prevent it, when we
know that to be impo&s;&s;ible. I replied,
That we might ju&s;tly fear, not Death it
&s;elf, but its Approaches; and that Pre&s;er|vatives
were u&s;eful, becau&s;e they might at
lea&s;t &s;tave it off from us for a while. Ve|ry
good, replied he again, but do&s;t thou
not &s;ee, that &s;ince the nece&s;&s;ity of dying
is indi&s;pen&s;ible, and the putting it off for a
while, can be of no other &s;ervice to us,
than to keep us the longer under conti|nual
pain, grief, and angui&s;h. I an&s;wer|ed
him, that the&s;e Rea&s;ons would be of
much more weight among our <HI>Europeans,</HI>
than among them who know not what it
<PB N="100" REF="52">
is to &s;uffer; whereas the Life of the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI>
was nothing el&s;e but a <HI>continued
Chain</HI> of Mi&s;eries and Sufferings.</P>
<P>How, &s;ays he, have you any other In|firmities
than tho&s;e of being <HI>Mortal,</HI> and
knowing your &s;elves to be daily advan|cing
towards Death? Yes, I a&s;&s;ured him,
that our People commonly died <HI>many
Deaths,</HI> before they came to die for good
and all, and that Death came not upon
our <HI>Europeans,</HI> but by the Violence of
tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es that knockt them down,
and made them at la&s;t faint away under
them. This an&s;wer was to him a <HI>My&s;te|ry:</HI>
And as I was endeavouring to make
him comprehend our <HI>Gouts,</HI> our <HI>Head|aches,</HI>
and our <HI>Colicks;</HI> I found he under|&s;tood
me not, and therefore to make him
apprehend my meaning, I was forced
particularly to explain to him the Na|ture
of &s;ome of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es we &s;uffer;
which a&s;&s;oon as he under&s;tood, <HI>Is it
po&s;&s;ible,</HI> cried he, <HI>that any one &s;hould be in
love with &s;uch a Life as that?</HI> I an&s;wered,
that our People did not only love it, but
u&s;ed all manner of means to prolong it;
from whence he took a fre&s;h occa&s;ion to
condemn us, either for in&s;en&s;ibility, or
extravagance, not being able, as he &s;aid,
to conceive how a rea&s;onable Man that
<PB N="101" REF="52">
was a&s;&s;ured of his Death, and that &s;aw
him&s;elf daily dying, by &s;everal &s;orts of
Sufferings, and that could not protract
his Life, but in continual Langui&s;hment,
could po&s;&s;ibly forbear de&s;iring Death, as
his greate&s;t happine&s;s. Our opinions, in
this matter, are va&s;tly different, &s;ays he,
from yours: For we, a&s;&s;oon as we come
to under&s;tand our &s;elves, becau&s;e we
think our &s;elves obliged to love our own
&s;elves, and look upon our &s;elves, but as
&s;o many <HI>Victims of a &s;uperiour Cau&s;e,</HI> that
is able every moment to de&s;troy us, we
therefore make very &s;mall account of our
Life, and e&s;teem it but as a <HI>Happine&s;s,
which we can enjoy but as a Pa&s;&s;enger,</HI> whil&s;t
it is fleeting and pa&s;&s;ing from us. The
time in which we enjoy it, is bur|then&s;ome
to us, becau&s;e it &s;erves for no|thing
but to rai&s;e in us a grief for the lo&s;s
of that happine&s;s, which it more lightly
takes from us, than at fir&s;t it gave it us.
In fine, We are weary of living, becau&s;e
we dur&s;t not fix our <HI>Affection upon our &s;elves
with all that tenderne&s;s,</HI> we might other|wi&s;e
have, for fear of enduring too great
violences of Reluctance, when we &s;hall
be forced to part from a being we have
&s;o much doated on. To that I an&s;wer|ed
him, That Rea&s;on teaches us, that it was

<HI>always better to be, than not to be, and that
'twas better to live, tho' but for a day, than
never to live at all:</HI> To which he reply|ed,
that we were to di&s;tingui&s;h two things
in our Being; one was our general exi|&s;tence,
that peri&s;hes not, and the other
our particular Exi&s;tence, or <HI>Individuality</HI>
that peri&s;hes. The fir&s;t is indeed better
than privation, and that 'tis in that &s;en&s;e,
'tis true; that being is preferable before
not being; but that the &s;econd, <HI>viz.</HI> the
being of our <HI>Individuality,</HI> or particular be|ing
is oftentimes wor&s;e than not being,
e&s;pecially when tis accompanied with a
Knowledge that renders us unhappy. I an|&s;wered
again, that if being in general
were better than not being, it mu&s;t needs
follow, That being likewi&s;e in particular,
was better than its Privation: But he &s;a|tisfied
me, by propo&s;ing to me the very
State in which I had lately been. Tell
me, I prithee, &s;ays he, when thou con&s;i|dered&s;t
thy condition in the place of
which thou told&s;t us, <HI>environned on all
&s;ides by Death;</HI> could thou po&s;&s;ibly e&s;teem
thy Life at that time a Happine&s;s, and
could thou value it better than nothing?
Is it not true, that the Knowledge thou
had&s;t, &s;erved then only to <HI>augment thy
mi&s;ery?</HI> It is then to no purpo&s;e to main|tain
<PB N="103" REF="54">
that Knowledge that afflicts me, is
not only no Happine&s;s to me, but an
unhappine&s;s &s;o much the more &s;en&s;ible,
as I know it the more perfectly: It is
from <HI>that principle that flows our true Mi|&s;ery,</HI>
that we know what we are, and
what we mu&s;t be, we know that we are
noble, and excellent beings: In a word,
worthy of an eternal Duration, and yet
we &s;ee that for all our Noblene&s;s and Ex|cellence,
we depend of a <HI>Thou&s;and other
Creatures,</HI> that are inferiour to us, which
is the cau&s;e we look upon our &s;elves, as
bweings that were brought up only to be
rendered &s;o much the more unhappy,
and that it is which makes us chu&s;e ra|ther
<HI>not to be at all,</HI> than to be at the &s;ame
time &s;o excellent, and &s;o mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> were &s;o &s;trongly per&s;wa|ded
of this Truth; that they <HI>&s;ought Death
with the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion</HI> in the World:
But becau&s;e by that means our Country
begun to grow de&s;olate, and di&s;peopled,
rea&s;ons were found out to per&s;wade tho&s;e
which remained, to &s;pare them&s;elves for
&s;ome time: for it was repre&s;ented to
them, that &s;o very <HI>fine and &s;pacious a Coun|try,</HI>
ought not to be left u&s;ele&s;s; that we
are an <HI>Ornament of the Univer&s;e,</HI> and
therefore ought to endure Life, tho' it
<PB N="104" REF="55">
were but to plea&s;e that <HI>Soveraign Ma&s;ter</HI>
that gave it us. Upon which, &s;ome time
after, in order to Re-implace tho&s;e that
had &s;ought for Re&s;t in a voluntary Death,
all that remained alive, obliged them|&s;elves
to pre&s;ent no le&s;s than <HI>three Children
to the Hebs;</HI> by which means, all the
Country being well Repeopled, an order
was publi&s;hed, that no Per&s;on &s;hould
have permi&s;&s;ion to go to his <HI>Long Re&s;t,</HI>
but &s;uch a one who &s;hould pre&s;ent another
Man to the <HI>Heb,</HI> either his own Son, or
another, who was willing to be his Lieu|tenant,
and to &s;upply his place; and it
was oreered, at the &s;ame time, that none
&s;hould have the priviledge, neither to de|mand
&s;uch a Permi&s;&s;ion, till he had liv|ed
at lea&s;t 100 Years, or could &s;hew &s;ome
Wound that extreamly incommoded him.
Ju&s;t as he had <HI>fini&s;hed</HI> tho&s;e words, we were
joyned by <HI>two Brethren,</HI> for which I was
very &s;orry, becau&s;e I never found my
<HI>Old Man</HI> in &s;o good a humour to di&s;cover
to me the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> of all tho&s;e things,
of which I demanded of him &s;ome Ex|plication.</P>
<P>And now to proceed with our <HI>Narra|tion,</HI>
there never is held any <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> at the
<HI>Heb,</HI> at which there is not twenty
or thirty Per&s;ons that demand the Liber|ty
<PB N="105" REF="55">
to return to their re&s;t, and they never
refu&s;e any, be they who they will, that
produce ju&s;t Rea&s;ons for it: And when
any one has <HI>obtained Permi&s;&s;ion to go out of
this Life,</HI> he pre&s;ents his Lieutenant, who
mu&s;t be at lea&s;t 36 years of age. The
Company receives him with Joy, and
gives him the Name of the <HI>old Man</HI> that
has a Mind to die; which done, they
repre&s;ent to him the brave actions of his
Predece&s;&s;ors, and tell him they are con|fident,
he will not degenerate from the ver|tue
of him, who&s;e place he is going to
&s;upply. When that <HI>Ceremony</HI> is over, the
<HI>old Man</HI> goes merrily to the Table, fur|ni&s;hed
for that effect, with the <HI>Fruit of
Rest,</HI> where he eats to the number of
eight of them, with a &s;miling and calm
Countenance; when he has eaten <HI>Four</HI>
of them, his Heart begins to dilate, and
his Spleen to enlarge it &s;elf; &s;o that the
extraordinary joy he feels within him,
makes him commit &s;everal extravagan|cies,
as <HI>dancing, leaping,</HI> and <HI>talking</HI> all
manner of idle fooli&s;h things, which the
Brethren take no notice of, as coming
from a Man that has lo&s;t his rea&s;on: then
they pre&s;ent him two more, that quite di|&s;tract
his Brain; after which, his Lieute|nant,
and another Per&s;on conduct him
<PB N="106" REF="56">
to the place, he before-hand cho&s;e for a
<HI>Sepulchre,</HI> where they give him two more
of the afore&s;aid Fruits, which plunge him
into an <HI>Eternal Sleep.</HI> Then they clo&s;e up
his Tomb, and return back, be&s;eeching
the <HI>Soveraign Being,</HI> to advance tho&s;e hap|py
Moments, in which they may have the
Priviledge to enjoy the <HI>like Rest</HI> with their
departed Brother. In this manner are
the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> born, and thus they live
and die.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Exerci&s;es of the <HI>Au&s;tralians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> reckon their Years
from the <HI>fir&s;t point of the Sol&s;tice of
Capricorn,</HI> to the revolution of the &s;ame
Point, and they judge of it exactly by the
&s;hadow of a Point fa&s;tned to a Wall, and
oppo&s;ed directly to the <HI>South:</HI> And when
that Shadow is come to the lowe&s;t Point
in all their Appartments, then they know,
the Year is fini&s;hed. From that Point to
the Equinox in <HI>March,</HI> they count a <HI>Sueb,</HI>
or Month; from that Equinox again to
the <HI>Sol&s;tice of</HI> Cancer, they count another
<PB N="107" REF="56">
Month; from that time to the other E|quinox,
they count a third Month; and
their fourth Month extends from that
Equinox to the Sol&s;tice of <HI>Capricorn;</HI> &s;o
that they have but <HI>four Months in the Year.</HI>
They call <HI>Suew</HI> what we call <HI>Weeks,</HI> and
reckon them by Moons; they divide the
Day (which they call <HI>Suec)</HI> into three
parts: The beginning of the Day they
call <HI>Mure;</HI> the middle part they call <HI>Dure,</HI>
and the latter part they call <HI>Spure.</HI> They
make no divi&s;ion of the Night, becau&s;e
they pa&s;s it wholly in <HI>profound Sleep,</HI> which
they procure by eating &s;ome <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting Fruits</HI>
before they go to Sleep, which lay them
&s;o fa&s;t, that nothing is able to wake them
&s;o long as their Sen&s;es remain benummed
by the vertue of tho&s;e Fruits. Their <HI>Mure</HI>
begins at Five in the Morning, and la&s;ts
'till Ten; their <HI>Dure</HI> follows next, and
ends at Three in the Afternoon; and then
&s;ucceeds their <HI>Spure,</HI> which la&s;ts 'till Eight
at Night. The fir&s;t part of the Day is
employed for the <HI>Heb,</HI> and the Sciences;
the &s;econd for Work; and the third for
<HI>publick Exerci&s;e.</HI> They go the <HI>Heb</HI> every
five Days; and this is the order they ob|&s;erve
in it: The fir&s;t Quarter pa&s;&s;es the
<HI>Mure</HI> there, the &s;econd the <HI>Dure,</HI> and the
third the <HI>Spure.</HI> The &s;econd day, the
<PB N="108" REF="57">
fourth Quarter &s;pends the <HI>Mure</HI> there, the
fifth the <HI>Dure,</HI> and the &s;ixth the <HI>Spure.</HI> The
third day &s;ucceeds in the &s;aid three parts
of the day, the &s;eventh, the eighth, and
the ninth; and the two following days
the re&s;t of the Quarters in the &s;ame or|der;
&s;o that the &s;ixth day the fir&s;t Quar|ter
begins again; not in the <HI>Mure,</HI> or Mor|ning,
but in the <HI>Dure.</HI> By this means it
comes to pa&s;s, That there are always 400
Per&s;ons at the <HI>Hab,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e of the
<HI>Hebs</HI> that follow their re&s;pective Quar|ters.
Thus they pa&s;s one third part of the
Day in the <HI>Hab,</HI> without &s;peaking one
Word, ob&s;erving a &s;teps di&s;tance between
per&s;on and per&s;on, and are all the while
&s;o attentive upon what they are then think|ing
upon, that nothing is able in the lea&s;t
to di&s;tract their thoughts. I was told, They
formerly u&s;ed to make &s;ome <HI>outward &s;igns,</HI>
accompanied with wry Faces, and odd
po&s;tures of Body, but now they have
wholly aboli&s;h'd them, as unworthy of
rea&s;onable men to do. Tho&s;e days in
which they go not to the <HI>Hab,</HI> they are
obliged to be at the <HI>Heb,</HI> to treat <HI>of the
Sciences;</HI> which they do with an order and
method&punc; mo&s;t admirably plain, and per|fectly
agreeing in all its parts. They pro|po&s;e
every one in their turn all their <HI>diffi|culties,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="57">
which they maintain with pow|erful
Rea&s;ons; after which, they an&s;wer
all the objections which their <HI>Antagoni&s;ts</HI>
oppo&s;e again&s;t them. When the <HI>Di&s;pute</HI>
is ended, they, if any thing of Impor|tance
happen to have been propo&s;ed,
they write it into the <HI>publick Book,</HI> and
every one carefully &s;ets it down too in
private. If any of them know any thing
that di&s;plea&s;es him, or that he thinks
may be advantagious to his Country, he
propo&s;es it to the Brethren, who take
&s;uch re&s;olutions thereupon, as they judge
mo&s;t rea&s;onable, without aiming at any
thing but the publick Good.</P>
<P>They employ the next third part of
their Day in their Gardens, which they
cultivate with &s;uch art and skill, as is un|known
in <HI>Europe.</HI> They know how to
give &s;uch an agreeable &s;weetne&s;s to their
Fruits, by watering their Trees with cer|tain
Liquors, that nothing can be eaten
more delicious than they. Their <HI>Flower-Pots</HI>
are enamell'd with a thou&s;and &s;orts
of Flowers, of different beauties, that
&s;eem to vie with one another in finene&s;s
and variety of colours, and in the charms
of their perfuming &s;mells. Their Walks
are longer than the Sight can reach, and
&s;o neatly ordered, that nothing of that
<PB N="110" REF="58">
nature can be more compleat. The whole
is cut through in all convenient places
with a thou&s;and different &s;orts of Water-Works,
which are made into <HI>Ba&s;ons,
Chanels, Ca&s;cades,</HI> and all that Art can
invent for the plea&s;ure of the Sen&s;es, that
tho&s;e Gardens are thereby made &s;uch
really, as we fancy them to be &s;ometimes
in Idea, when we let our Imagination
follow the dictates of our luxurious de|&s;ires.</P>
<P>The la&s;t third part of their Day is al|lotted
for three &s;orts of very diverting Ex|erci&s;es;
the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in producing
what they have newly invented, or re|peating
the Experiments of what they
had already &s;hewn; but there &s;eldom
pa&s;&s;es a day but they propo&s;e &s;ome new
Invention, upon which they always take
care to Regi&s;ter the Name of the Inven|tor
in their Book of publick Curio&s;ities,
which they e&s;teem one of the greate&s;t ho|nours
can be done them; and in 32 years
time, I ob&s;erved above 5000 of the&s;e
new Inventions Recorded, that would
pa&s;s for &s;o many Prodigies among us.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd Exerci&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in mana|ging
two &s;orts of Arms, one of which is
very like our Halberds, and the other re|&s;embles
much our Organ-Pipes. They u&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="58">
the former with great agility, but yet not
with altogether &s;o much dexterity as our
<HI>Europeans.</HI> Their Halberts are &s;o ma&s;&s;ie
and &s;trong, that they will ea&s;ily run
through the bodies of &s;ix Men, one be|hind
another. They are made of &s;ix
pieces of Wood, &s;ea&s;oned with Sea-water,
impregnated with &s;ome certain Drugs,
which render them very hard, and yet
very light. The other Arms which I have
compared to our Organ-Pipes, are com|po&s;ed
of ten or twelve Pipes, which are
furni&s;hed with certain Springs at one end,
which being let go, di&s;charge Bullets
with &s;o great a force, that they pierce
through the bodies of &s;ix Men, one after
another, at one &s;hot, the action of which
Spring is &s;o quick and rapid, that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
to fence off its blow, but men find
them&s;elves &s;hot before they are aware
they were aimed at.</P>
<P>As for their Halberts they exerci&s;e
them in throwing thirty or forty Paces,
and that &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that in fifteen
throws they &s;eldom mi&s;s twice of their
mark. But their Strength is much more
prodigious than their Art, for they
carry, without &s;training them&s;elves, to
the weight of &s;ix or &s;even <HI>Quintals,</HI> or
hundred weight; and pull up Trees by
<PB N="112" REF="59">
the Roots, which we could hardly &s;hake;
&amp; I &s;aw one of them, that after he had run
through, with his Halbert, four half men,
as they call us, carried them afterwards
upon one of his Shoulders, hanging upon
his Halbert, two before, and two be|hind.</P>
<P>Their third Exerci&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in throw|ing
certain Balls, of three or four different
&s;izes, &s;ome of which they throw up into
the Air, and &s;ome at Butts, or Marks;
tho&s;e which they ca&s;t into the Air, to be
well thrown, mu&s;t hit one another in a
certain point mark'd out; and tho&s;e which
are ca&s;t again&s;t Butts, mu&s;t pa&s;s through
a hole in the &s;aid Butt, which they will
often do ten or twelve times together.
And that which is mo&s;t to be remarked
in the&s;e Exerci&s;es, is, that they perform
them with much briskne&s;s and gayety,
which yet is tempered with a certain Air
of Gravity and Maje&s;ty, without any di&s;|order
or di&s;compo&s;ure of mind. The
Balls they throw one at another, are like
our <HI>Tennis-Balls,</HI> but &s;ofter, and le&s;s dan|gerous:
and the Art of him that throws
them con&s;i&s;ts in hitting him again&s;t whom
he plays: and his Adver&s;ary on the other
&s;ide, places all his skill in avoiding the
&s;troke aimed at him; and the plea&s;ure of
<PB N="113" REF="59">
&s;eeing them is &s;o great, that there is no|thing
but People will quit, to go to &s;ee &s;uch
a Diverti&s;ement. For &s;ometimes they ca|pringly
leap backward, to let the Ball pa&s;s
by them, and &s;ometimes they turn and
bend their bodies &s;o many-&s;everal ways,
that there is no Rope-Dancer or Tumbler
among us can come near them for agility.
When he that throws the Ball, lets flie 3 or
4, one after another, it is an admirable
thing to &s;ee the dextrous behaviour of him
again&s;t whom they are directed, who
&s;toops to avoid the one, bends him&s;elf to
e&s;cape another, receives and throws back
the third and the fourth with his-hands,
and &s;ometimes with his feet; which &s;everal
actions he performs almo&s;t all in the &s;ame
in&s;tant; becau&s;e all the Balls being always
thrown very &s;traight, it nece&s;&s;arily hapens,
either that all of them hit, or that he at
whom they are aimed mu&s;t u&s;e an extra|ordinary
dexterity in avoiding, or putting
them by. I was counted very dextrous in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> but yet I &s;eemed very unhandy
among the <HI>Au&s;tralians;</HI> and had I not pre|tended
an excu&s;e, by rea&s;on of the wounds
I had received, I &s;hould have made them
think my Nation to be very dull and un|active
People.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Language, and of
the Studies of the <HI>Au&s;tralians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> have three ways of
expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, as we have in
<HI>Europe,</HI> that is, by <HI>Voice,</HI> by <HI>Signs,</HI> and by
<HI>Writing.</HI> Among the&s;e, <HI>Signs</HI> are mo&s;t fa|miliar
with them; and I have ob&s;erved
them to conver&s;e together &s;everal hours,
without declaring their minds any other
way than that. They never &s;peak but
when it is nece&s;&s;ary to make continued
Di&s;cour&s;es, and to expre&s;s a long Series
of Propo&s;itions: All their Words are <HI>Mo|no&s;yllables,</HI>
and they have but one <HI>Conju|gation;</HI>
as for Example, <HI>Af,</HI> &s;ignifies to
Love; which is thus conjugated in the
<HI>Pre&s;ent Ten&s;e, La, Pa, Ma, i. e.</HI> I Love,
thou Love&s;t, he Loves: <HI>Lla, Ppa, Mma;</HI>
we Love, you Love, they Love. They
have but one <HI>Ten&s;e</HI> for the time pa&s;t, <HI>Lga,
Pga, Mga, i. e.</HI> I have Loved, thou ha&s;t
Loved, he has Loved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Future</HI> is,
<HI>Lda, Pda, Mda,</HI> I &s;hall, or will Love, <HI>&amp;c.
Llda, Ppda, Mmda,</HI> we &s;hall, or will
Love, <HI>&amp;c. Uf</HI> in the <HI>A&s;tralian</HI> Tongue &s;ig|nifies
<PB N="115" REF="60">
to work, which they conjugate thus,
<HI>Lu, Pu, Mu,</HI> I work, thou worke&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.
Lgu, Pgu, Mgu,</HI> we Work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o
in the other Ten&s;es.</P>
<P>They have no Declen&s;ions, nor Arti|cles,
and but very few Nouns: They ex|pre&s;s
&s;imple &s;ub&s;tances by one &s;ingle Vow|el,
and Compound Bodies, by the Vow|els
that &s;ignifie the chief Elements, of
which they are compo&s;ed. They own
but five &s;imple Bodies or Elements, of
which the fir&s;t and noble&s;t in their e&s;teem
is the Fire, which they expre&s;s by the &s;in|gle
Vowel <HI>A,</HI> the &s;econd is the Air, which
they call <HI>E,</HI> the third is Salt, which
they call <HI>G,</HI> the fourth is Water, which
they call <HI>I,</HI> and the fifth is Earth, which
they call <HI>U.</HI></P>
<P>All their Adjectives and their Epithets
are expre&s;&s;ed by &s;o many &s;ingle Con&s;o|nants,
of which they have a greater number
than the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Every Con&s;onant &s;ig|nifies
a Quality that belongs to the things
&s;ignified by the Vowels: Thus <HI>B</HI> &s;igni|fies
Clear, <HI>C</HI> Hot, <HI>D</HI> Di&s;agreeable, <HI>F</HI> Dry:
and by the&s;e Explications they &s;o perfect|ly
from their words, that a&s;&s;oon as a
Man hears them pronounced, he pre|&s;ently
conceives the nature of things they
&s;ignifie; as for example, they call the
<PB N="116" REF="61">
Stars <HI>AeB,</HI> a word which &s;ignifies in one
Breath, the two chief Elements, or &s;imple
Bodies, of which they are compo&s;ed, and
withal, that they are Luminous. They call
the Sun <HI>Aab,</HI> the Birds <HI>Oef,</HI> which &s;ignifies at
once, that they are compo&s;ed of a dry,
&s;alt and airy &s;ub&s;tance. They call a Man
<HI>Vez,</HI> which &s;ignifies a &s;ub&s;tance, partly
airy, and partly Earthy, tempered with
&s;ome moi&s;ture; the &s;ame method they
ob&s;erve in the compo&s;ition of other
Names. The advantage of this way of
&s;peaking is, that by this means a Man be|comes
a Philo&s;opher, by learning the fir&s;t
words he pronounces, and that one can
name nothing at the &s;ame time, which
would pa&s;s for a miraculous thing with
any one that knew not their Alphabet,
nor the compo&s;ition of their words.</P>
<P>And if their way of &s;peaking be admi|rable,
their method of writing is much
more: they u&s;e only points to expre&s;s
their Vowels, which points are di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
only by their Situation. They
have Five places for them, the uppermo&s;t
&s;ignifying <HI>A,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>E,</HI> and &s;o for|ward.
As for example.</P>
<P>A, E, I, O, U.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="61">
And though it &s;eems to us very difficult
to di&s;tingui&s;h them, yet u&s;e has made it
very ea&s;ie to them: they have 36 Con&s;o|nants,
24 of which are remarkable; they
are little &s;trokes that are made round
about the points, and &s;ignifie according
to the order of their &s;everal places; as for
example, <HI>E B</HI> &s;ignifies clear Air, <HI>I C</HI> Hot
Water, <HI>I X</HI> Cold Water, <HI>U L</HI> Moi&s;t
Earth, <HI>A F</HI> Dry fire, <HI>E S</HI> White Air,
and &s;o all the re&s;t: they have about 18
or 19 more, which we have no Con&s;o|nants
in <HI>Europe</HI> that can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>The more we con&s;ider that way of
writing, the more &s;ecrets we &s;hall find
in it to admire. <HI>B</HI> &s;ignifies clear, or bright,
<HI>C</HI> hot, <HI>X</HI> cold, <HI>L</HI> moi&s;t, <HI>F</HI> dry, <HI>S</HI> white,
<HI>N</HI> black, <HI>T</HI> green, <HI>D</HI> di&s;agreeable, <HI>P</HI> &s;weet,
<HI>Q</HI> plea&s;ant, <HI>R</HI> bitter, <HI>M</HI> de&s;irable, <HI>G</HI> evil,
<HI>Z</HI> high, <HI>H</HI> low, J con&s;onant red, <HI>A</HI> join'd
with 2, peaceable. Thus a&s;&s;oon as they
hear, or pronounce a word, they appre|hend
at the &s;ame time the nature of the
thing &s;ignified by it; as when they write
this word <HI>Ipin,</HI> they pre&s;ently under&s;tand
by it an Apple, both &s;weet and delicious,
and <HI>Izd,</HI> a bad and di&s;agreeable Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
When they teach a Child, they explain
to him all the Elements, and the nature
of all things &s;ignified by the words he
<PB N="118" REF="62">
pronounces. Which is of wonderful ad|vantage,
as well to the publick, as to par|ticular
per&s;ons: becau&s;e as &s;oon as they
know how to read, which is commonly
at three years old, they apprehend at the
&s;ame time the Properties of all manner of
Beings. They attain to perfection in rea|ding
at ten years; and are skilled in all
the Secrets of their Letters at fourteen.
They under&s;tand all the difficulties of Phi|lo&s;ophy
at twenty, and from twenty, to
twenty five, they apply them&s;elves to the
contemplation of the Stars; and they di|vide
that Study into three parts; the fir&s;t
concerns the Revolution of the Stars, the
&s;econd, their di&s;tinction, and the third,
their qualities, with their Rea&s;onings
thereupon, which are quite different from
tho&s;e of our <HI>Europeans,</HI> upon that Subject.
But this being a Matter purely Philo&s;ophi|cal,
it is no proper place here to enter into
any particular explication of it.</P>
<P>From twenty five till twenty eight
years of Age, they imploy them&s;elves in
&s;tudying the Hi&s;tory of their Country;
and 'tis only in that one point they &s;hew
a weakne&s;s of mind, like to that of other
People, as well in re&s;pect of the great
Antiquity to which they extend their
Original, as of the fabulous things they
<PB N="119" REF="62">
relate of the fir&s;t Men from which they
pretend them&s;elves de&s;cended. For they
count above 12000 Revolutions of Sol|&s;tices
&s;ince the beginning of their Re|publick.
They pretend to derive their O|riginal
from <HI>HAAB,</HI> that is, a God, who,
they &s;ay, produced three Men, from
whom all the re&s;t de&s;cended. They have
&s;ome Records written upon old Barks of
Trees, that contain 8000 Revolutions of
their Hi&s;tory, which are written in the
form of Annals; the re&s;t is comprehen|ded
in 48 Volumes, of a prodigious big|ne&s;s;
but all that is reported in them, has
more of the appearance of Romantick
Prodigies, than of real hi&s;torical Events,
and is more wonderful than credible. For
if all they relate be true, the Stars are
multiplied by two thirds more than they
were at fir&s;t; the Sun grown bigger by
one half; and the Moon on the contrary,
&s;hrunk much le&s;s; the Sea has changed
its place; and a thou&s;and other like things
have happened contrary to all appearance
of probability.</P>
<P>As for us <HI>Europeans,</HI> and the re&s;t of
Mankind, they make our Race to begin
not 'till 5000 Revolutions after them, and
the Original which they give us, is alto|gether
<PB N="120" REF="63">
Ridiculous; for they Report, <HI>That
a Serpent of an unmea&s;urable bigne&s;s, and of
an amphibious nature, which they call</HI> Ams,
<HI>throwing him&s;elf upon a Woman, while &s;he
was a&s;leep, and having enjoyed her, without
doing her any other mi&s;chief, the Woman
waking towards the end of the action, was
&s;truck with &s;uch a horror at it, that in a
fright &s;he threw her &s;elf into the Sea; but that
the Serpent leaping in after her, &s;wam by her,
and keeping her above water, carried her to a
neighbouring I&s;land, where the Woman re|covering
her fright, and being moved with
the &s;trange friend&s;hip &s;hown her by that Ani|mal,
repented of her de&s;pair, and was wrought
upon to u&s;e all endeavours to pre&s;erve her life,
and accordingly &s;ought about that De&s;art for
all that might contribute to her Nouri&s;hment;
and the Serpent on his &s;ide, brought her all he
could find. At la&s;t this Woman was deli|vered
of two Children, the one a Boy, and the
other a Girl. Upon which the Serpent re|doubled
bis care, and never cea&s;ed going up
and down to look for Provi&s;ions to feed the
Mother and the Children; and when he could
not meet with the Fruits which they ordinarily
fed upon, he would take Fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes
&s;mall Animals&punc; and bring them to eat. But
as tho&s;e Children grew up, they &s;hewed every
day more and more vi&s;ible marks of malice</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="63">
<HI>and brutality, which &s;o grieved the Mother,
that nothing could appea&s;e her &s;orrow. The
Serpent thereupon taking notice of her trouble,
and thinking &s;he pined after her own Country,
after he had endeavoured to comfort ber with|out
any effect, he made her under&s;tand by
&s;igns, that if &s;he had a mind to return to her
own Country People, he was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her in her return, as he had done in bringing
her where &s;he was now. Upon this, the Wo|man
threw her &s;elf into the Water, more out
of de&s;ign to try the good will of the Serpent,
than out of any other motive; at the &s;ame in|&s;tant
the Serpent leapt after, and holding her
fa&s;t imbraced under him, carried her back
in a few hours into her own Country; after
which he return<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d back to his two young Chil|dren,

<P>THere is none that are but never &s;o
little ver&s;ed in the knowledge of
Foreign Countries, but knows there are
&s;ome peculiar Animals in them as diffe|rent
from tho&s;e of other Regions, as the

from what other place &s;oever.
The Woods and Fore&s;ts of the &s;ame

no Flies; <HI>Candia</HI> has no venemous Crea|tures;

into the I&s;les of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> lo&s;es its
venome, and is no longer mortal when
in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the bigge&s;t Animals
are not always the mo&s;t hurtful; and
tho&s;e &s;mall Vermine, which the <HI>Austra|lians</HI>
can hardly tell how to conceive,
though they have nothing rare in them
but their life, yet do &s;o much mi&s;chief in
divers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they often
cau&s;e Famine, Plague, and other con&s;i|derable
Calamities, as might be proved
by infinite number of experiences; for
which rea&s;on I mu&s;t needs reckon it to
be one of the greate&s;t happine&s;&s;es of the
<HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> that they are exempted from
all manner of In&s;ects. There is not to be
found any venomous Bea&s;t in all their
Countrey; and therefore they often lie
down, and &s;leep on the bare ground, not
only without any danger, but with great
plea&s;ure: And 'tis from thence they like|wi&s;e
gather a great part of tho&s;e fair and
<PB N="124" REF="65">
delicious Fruits that there abound. They
u&s;ed for a long time, to keep three &s;orts
of four-footed Bea&s;ts, and they &s;till keep
&s;o many &s;orts in &s;everal parts: The lea&s;t
of them may be compared to our Apes,
but their Faces are not hairy, their Eyes are
even with their Head, their Ears are pretty
long, and their Mouth and No&s;e are like a
Man's. They have longer Claws than other
Apes, with five Fingers each&punc; with which
they hold and carry what they will, with
as much ea&s;e and dexterity as Men. They
are very active, and turn their bodies in|to
a great many po&s;tures, that require as
much dexterity as agility: The love they
have to Men is &s;o great, that they will
&s;tarve them&s;elves, and die for grief, if
they be &s;eparated from them. When
they are in the pre&s;ence of any Man, they
never cea&s;e giving him all the diverti&s;e|ment
they can, by their various Motions
and Po&s;tures. They are now bani&s;ht out
of a great many <HI>Sezains,</HI> becau&s;e they
were too trouble&s;ome, and particularly in
their Religious A&s;&s;embly in the <HI>HAB;</HI>
for as they could not keep them from go|ing
thither without locking them up, and
running the risk of finding them dead with
pining, when they came home; &s;o on the
other &s;ide, they could not let them go thi|ther,
<PB N="125" REF="65">
without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to be
continually di&s;turbed at their devout Con|templations,
and without a vi&s;ible Pro|fanation
of &s;o venerable a place. The A|nimals
of the &s;econd &s;ort, are &s;omething
like our Hogs, &s;ave only that their Hair
is as &s;oft as Silk, and their Snouts are long|er
by half than tho&s;e of Swine. They
call them Hums; they have the in&s;tinct
to work, and turn up the Earth in right
lines, with as much, or more dexterity
than our be&s;t Husbandmen, and have no
need of any Leader, to guide them in
beginning, continuing, and ending their
furrows; yet they have de&s;troyed them
in mo&s;t of the <HI>Sezains,</HI> becau&s;e of the na|&s;tine&s;s
they fill all places with, and becau&s;e
they are u&s;eful but &s;even or eight days in

of heavy Burdens, and of &s;uch things as
are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in the Commerce of

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Animals, there are four
&s;orts of Birds, which well de&s;erve our

flutter about like tame Hens, and are a|bout
their bigne&s;s; they are of a charm|ing
Carnation Colour, however they be|gin
now to bani&s;h them out of the <HI>Sezains,</HI>
becau&s;e they do a great deal of mi&s;chief
in the Flower-pots and Gardens.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and third &s;orts are like
our <HI>Tom-Tits,</HI> and <HI>Yellow-Hammers,</HI> but a
little bigger; and &s;o tame, that they are
often fain to drive them away forcibly off
from Peoples bodies; and their Voices
are &s;o &s;weet, that they are preferred be|fore
the &s;weete&s;t Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick;
they flutter about the Brethren, and fol|low
them every where; they go into the
very <HI>Hab,</HI> where they cau&s;e a certain
chearfulne&s;s and calmne&s;s of Spirit, by
their chirping, which they call <HI>Pacd,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, Diverti&s;ement of Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s:
They never eat but with the Bre|thren,
<PB N="127" REF="66">
nor take any re&s;t but when they
are perched &s;omewhere upon them.
And they have this property, that they
&s;mell the Birds of Prey at a great di&s;tance,
and peck the Brethren to give them no|tice
of it. The fourth &s;ort of Birds are a|bout
the bigne&s;s of our <HI>Oxen;</HI> they have
a long-pointed Head, and a Bill of a full
foot long, and &s;harper than a <HI>Razor;</HI> they
have right <HI>Bullocks</HI> Eyes &s;tanding out of
their Heads, two great Ears, Red and
White Feathers, a Neck, not &s;lender, but
very large, a Body twelve Foot long, and
four Foot broad, with a Tale turning up,
and furni&s;hed with long Feathers, a Sto|mach
under their Feathers as hard as Iron,
and of proof again&s;t all blows; and la&s;t|ly,
they have Feet, rather &s;lender than
thick, that are armed with five horrible
Talons, &s;trong enough to hold and carry
off with ea&s;e 300 weight: The&s;e horri|ble
Birds are called <HI>Urgs,</HI> and live only by
Prey. And accordingly at certain &s;et &s;ea|&s;ons,
they make &s;o cruel a War upon the <HI>Au|&s;tralians,</HI>
that they &s;ometimes carry off 4 or
500 of them in a day: A&s;&s;oon as they
have ta&s;ted of Man's fle&s;h, their Greedi|ne&s;s
after it &s;o mightily encrea&s;es, that
they omit no Stratagem or Invention to
get more of it; for &s;ometimes they place
<PB N="128" REF="67">
them&s;elves down from the middle Region
of the Air twelve or fourteen of them to|gether,
and throwing them&s;elves cro&s;s the
Arms of the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> &s;eldom fail to car|ry
off every one his Man. As the&s;e Ani|mals
are the greate&s;t Enemies the <HI>Au&s;tra|lians</HI>
have, they have u&s;ed, and &s;till daily
u&s;e incredible Endeavours to exterminate
them, &s;o far as to have de&s;troyed whole
I&s;lands of 30, and 35 Leagues compa&s;s,
and rai&s;ed Mountains of a League high,
to drive them away: but in &s;pight of all
they have yet done, or can do, I &s;ee no
likelihood they will ever be able to &s;e|cure
them&s;elves from them: For the
I&s;lands where they harbour are &s;o nume|rous
in that Country, and are &s;o full of
&s;uch va&s;tly high Rocks, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible
ever to de&s;troy them: But we &s;hall
&s;peak more amply of the&s;e Birds in the
next Chapter.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear telling you here, that
the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> are &s;o far from eating fle&s;h,
that they cannot conceive how any Man
can find in his Heart to do it; the rea|&s;ons
they alledge for it, are, fir&s;t, that &s;ort
of Nouri&s;hment cannot agree with Hu|manity,
that ought naturally to be aver&s;e
from all cruelty: &s;econdly, becau&s;e the
fle&s;h of Animals very much re&s;embling
<PB N="129" REF="67">
that of Men, it follows, that they which
can have the Stomach to eat of the fle&s;h
of the former, will ea&s;ily be induced to
eat without difficulty of the latter two:
thirdly, becau&s;e the dige&s;tion of it is dan|gerous,
and we cannot eat the fle&s;h of an
Animal, without contracting &s;ome of its
Inclinations: fourthly, becau&s;e the fle&s;h
of a Brute is &s;o modified for that Brute's
Nature, that we cannot eat of it, without
becoming proportionably more or le&s;s
like that Brute, as we eat more or le&s;s of
its fle&s;h: fifthly, becau&s;e a Bea&s;t is a thing
&s;o much beneath us, that it were better
for a Man not to be at all, than to deba&s;e
his noble nature, &s;o far as to adulterate
it with the mixture of that of a Bea&s;t, by
making it his Food. The <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI>
likewi&s;e hate Fi&s;h, no le&s;s than Land-Creatures,
and there are but very few to
be &s;een in their Seas or Rivers, becau&s;e
the Birds of Prey we ju&s;t now mentioned,
feed upon them, and make a continual
War upon them: And for my part I ne|ver
eat any other Fi&s;h there but a certain
&s;ort of <HI>Eels</HI> of three or four Ells long, and
&s;ome &s;mall finny-footed Creature, like

<P>Among the Bea&s;ts that I have de&s;cri|bed,
the <HI>Hums</HI> would render us ine&s;tima|ble
Service, becau&s;e they would ea&s;e our
men of the extraordinary pains they are
fain to take in digging and plowing up
the Earth; but the <HI>Suefs</HI> would prove
&s;till much more profitable to us than they,
for they are Bea&s;ts more gentle and tra|ctable
than Oxen, and may be kept &s;o
<PB N="131" REF="68">
cheap, that two pounds of Gra&s;s or Herbs
will keep one of them three Days. They
can endure a whole Day without eating,
and in the mo&s;t difficult Journies, they
will travel 18 or 20 Leagues out-right,
without any need of &s;topping to bait. It
is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s what profit the Merchants
would get by the&s;e Creatures, for they
would not need to be at the tenth part
of the charge they now are at for the
carriage of their Goods, two of the&s;e A|nimals
being able to carry as much as a
large Waggon drawn by &s;ix Hor&s;es. The
<HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> that have no need of any
Traffick, are excu&s;able for making no
more account of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, but the
<HI>Europeans</HI> would find it worth their while
to get &s;ome of them brought over, what|ever
price they co&s;t. But yet all this is no|thing
to the gain the <HI>Europeans</HI> might draw
from tho&s;e Birds of Prey of which I have
&s;poken; for tho&s;e Birds, though they are
very cruel when wild, yet may be tamed,
and made as gentle as any of our mo&s;t
<HI>dome&s;tick Animals.</HI> When I came fir&s;t in|to
<HI>Australia,</HI> they had one of them which
they kept in one of the <HI>Sezains,</HI> that car|ried
a Man on his back with more ea&s;e
than a <HI>Spani&s;h Cour&s;er.</HI> They are to be
mounted behind their Wings, and the
<PB N="132" REF="69">
Feathers on their Back &s;upply the place of
a very commodious Cu&s;hion; and in|&s;tead
of a Bridle, one need but tie a
piece of Whipcord about their Bills, with
which one may guide them whither and
how one plea&s;es. In this manner a man
may travel forty or fifty Leagues out right,
and then after about two Hours re&s;ting to
bait, he may go as many more; and &s;o
he may ea&s;ily travel 100 Leagues a day,
without any incommodity, without fear,
without danger, and without being trou|bled
with the oppo&s;ition of Rivers, Woods,
Mountains, or any other ob&s;tacle, or ill
rencounter in his way. But two Rea&s;ons,
however, obliged the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> to leave
off the u&s;e of them, which would be of
no force in <HI>Europe.</HI> The fir&s;t, is becau&s;e
tho&s;e Birds are extremely hot with Lu&s;t,
after carnal Conjunction, which was the
cau&s;e that &s;ometimes they would carry
their <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Riders into &s;ome <HI>I&s;land,</HI>
where they &s;melt a Female of their kind,
where they were devoured by the wild
Birds. The &s;econd, was becau&s;e they
were per&s;uaded, that the tame Birds of
that kind were the chief occa&s;ion that en|ticed
the wild ones to come in &s;uch num|bers
into their Country, where they made
&s;uch havock. Which con&s;iderations could

whither none would be tran&s;ported but
tame ones, and where there would be no
wild ones at all.</P>

that to us would appear miraculous. Its
faculty in procuring Re&s;t when we plea&s;e,
and the vertue of its Juice in healing, in
very little time, all manner of wounds,
induce me to believe there's no Ail, or Di|&s;temper
in <HI>Europe,</HI> for which it would not
prove a &s;overaign Remedy. I was infor|med
afterward, that it was with that all
my wounds were cured, I had received
at my coming; and though I afterward
received in &s;everal Fights many &s;ore blows
more, &s;ome whereof made great wounds

from my own Country, and the extra|ordinary
odd and &s;trange Cu&s;toms of the
People I conver&s;ed with, and which I
was obliged to conform to, gave me no
&s;mall cau&s;e to be <HI>Melancholick,</HI> and tor|mented
me with many a bitter reflection,
yet as &s;oon as I ta&s;ted but one of the <HI>Fruits
of Repo&s;e,</HI> all my Re&s;entments were calm|ed,
and my Courage and u&s;ual briskne&s;s
came to me again, my Blood danced in
my Veins, and I found my &s;elf in &s;uch a
di&s;po&s;ition both of body and mind, that
there was nothing I could de&s;ire to ren|der
my Contentment more compleat than
it was. Of what ine&s;timable price would
&s;uch <HI>Fruits</HI> be in <HI>Europe,</HI> where grief and
vexation kill the greate&s;t part of mankind,
<PB N="135" REF="70">
and troubles cau&s;e langui&s;hments far
wor&s;e, and far more formidable than
Death.</P>
<P>But can there be any thing imagined
more de&s;irable, than to live &s;plendidly
and fare very delicately, without being
at any charge, &s;ince for that end, one
need not have any greater Provi&s;ion than
three or four of tho&s;e Fruits, which are
incomparably more delicate, and of a
much richer Reli&s;h and Nouri&s;hment,
than our mo&s;t &s;ucculent Meats, and
mo&s;t artfully &s;ea&s;oned Di&s;hes, nor any o|ther
Drink, than a &s;ort of natural <HI>Nectar,</HI>
that is found running in &s;treams in that
Country, where every one may eat and
drink his fill, with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure
in the World, without being obliged, ei|ther
to Till the Earth, or cultivate any
Trees.</P>
<P>I have admired an hundred times how
Nature comes to be &s;o partially liberal to
that Country, to give away as 'twere in
&s;porting, and with a carele&s;s prodigality
tho&s;e things &s;he is &s;o nigardly of in our
Regions. But among other things, I
cannot pa&s;s in &s;ilence, that abundance of
fine Cry&s;tal that is there to be found,
and which the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> know how,
with &s;uch admirable Skill and Symmetry
<PB N="136" REF="71">
to cut, and put together, that it is very
hard to find where the Stones joyn, &s;o
exactly they &s;eem to be all of a piece.
This Cry&s;tal is &s;o tran&s;parent, that 'twere
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h any Po<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es in it,
if the rich Figures Nature forms in it of di|vers
colours, did not convince us it had
&s;ome.</P>
<P>But that, which in my Opinion &s;urpa&s;|&s;es
all the mo&s;t prodigious Rarities in the
World, is a <HI>Hab,</HI> which is to be &s;een in
the <HI>Seizain,</HI> or di&s;trict of <HI>Haf&punc;</HI> which is
made all out of one entire piece of Cry|&s;tal,
which could not be done, but by
cutting it out of a great Rock of the
&s;ame matter. This wonderful <HI>Hab&punc;</HI> or
<HI>Temple,</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the re&s;t in height and
breadth; for it is 200 Foot high, and 150
Foot wide; the Figures with which this
Cry&s;tal is inter&s;per&s;ed, are bigger than
tho&s;e ob&s;erved in the other, and it is vi|&s;ible
that they are all entire, without be|ing
patched up with any inlaid pieces:
They a&s;&s;ured me, that it had been oftentimes
debated among them, whether it
would not be better to de&s;troy it, than
to keep it &s;tanding, becau&s;e it tempts the
curio&s;ity of tho&s;e that dwell afar off, and
cau&s;es di&s;traction of Thoughts in them
that a&s;&s;emble in it: However it is yet
<PB N="137" REF="71">
&s;tanding, and I can hardly believe that
ever they can find in their Hearts' to vote
the demolition of &s;o rich and rare a
piece as that.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t difficulty I find in procu|ring
a Traffick in the&s;e Commodities be|tween
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tralia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in
finding out &s;ome way, either to force, or
otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch a Communi|cation;
for after having well con&s;idered
the whole matter, there appear to me
un&s;urmountable difficulties in &s;uch an en|terpri&s;e;
for the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> being a Peo|ple
that neither cover any thing; there is
no likelihood of bringing them to a Com|pliance,
by the allurements of Gain, of
Rewards, or of Plea&s;ure, nor any practi|cable
means left for us to overcome that
&s;trange aver&s;ion they have for us, which
is &s;o great, that they cannot endure to
hear us mentioned&punc; without declaring the
pa&s;&s;ion they have to de&s;troy us. And
then be&s;ides all tho&s;e things that we u&s;ual|ly
carry into the new di&s;covered Coun|tries,
and which procures us acce&s;s to their
Inhabitants, pa&s;s in the e&s;teem of the <HI>Au|&s;tralians,</HI>
for Childrens Play-things, and
meer trifles, and bawbles; they look up|on
our Gawdy Stuffs, and riche&s;t Silks,
as Spiders Webs, they know not &s;o much
<PB N="138" REF="72">
as what the names of Gold or Silver &s;igni|fie;
and in a word, all that we count
precious appear in their e&s;teem to be but
ridiculous; and therefore there remains
no other way to introduce our &s;elves a|mong
them, but by open force; and in
that matter they have a great advantage
over us, which would fru&s;trate all our
attempts that way; for the Sea in tho&s;e
parts is &s;o very &s;hallow, that it will hard|ly
carry a Boat, at two or three Leagues
di&s;tance from their Shoars, unle&s;s it be in
certain particular <HI>Creeks,</HI> where there are
&s;ome Veins of Water which cannot be
known, but by long experience. Be&s;ides
all which ob&s;tacles, they keep &s;o exact a
Guard upon all their Coa&s;ts, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to &s;urpri&s;e them, nor yet to attack
them with any hopes of Succe&s;s, as will
appear by the following Relation of &s;ome
of their Wars.</P>

<P>IT is by a con&s;tant <HI>Decree</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd in
the World, that we &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s no
happine&s;s without &s;ome pains, nor be able

therefore it is no wonder if the <HI>Au&s;trali|ans</HI>
be forced &s;ometimes to maintain great

&s;en&s;ible of the advantages wherewith
it is ble&s;&s;ed, make all po&s;&s;ible efforts to
open them&s;elves a way into it. The mo&s;t
formidable of all tho&s;e <HI>Neighbouring Na|tions</HI>
are the <HI>Fondins,</HI> a fierce and warlike
People, who are always ready to make
an Irruption upon them, in tho&s;e parts
where they are lea&s;t expected. Which
obliges the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> to keep &s;everal
Thou&s;and Men continually in Arms, to
guard the Shoars, and the Avenues of the
Mountains next the <HI>Sea,</HI> where they have
con&s;tantly upon Guard 20000 Men in
<PB N="140" REF="73">
the Compa&s;s of about &s;ixty Leagues of
Country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of tho&s;e Guards that di&s;covers
an Enemy approaching&punc; immediately
gives the &s;ignal agreed upon; which &s;ignal
con&s;i&s;ts in throwing up a kind of flying
Squib or Serpent, that flies very high, and
makes a noi&s;e to be heard two Leagues;
upon which, all the re&s;t to the right and
left hand, give the &s;ame Signals, &s;o that
in 24&punc; Hours, all the Coa&s;t takes the A|larm,
and the half of the Guards run to
the place where the Alarm began, with
&s;uch celerity, that in le&s;s than &s;ix Hours
time, there will a&s;&s;emble between 30. and
40000 Men; and when they find them|&s;elves
&s;trong enough to repul&s;e the Ene|my,
they take away the fir&s;t Signal, upon
which, all the re&s;t cea&s;e, and no more
Succours march up to them.</P>
<P>But that which &s;eems to me mo&s;t ad|mirable
in them, is to &s;ee them without
any Commanders to lead them, and with|out
having any previous Di&s;cour&s;e or
Communication one with another, or
receiving any Direction or In&s;truction;
they know how to po&s;t them&s;elves with
&s;o much Order and Di&s;cipline, that one
would think they were all &s;o many admi|rable
experienced Captains, that were
<PB N="141" REF="73">
all in&s;pired with the &s;ame de&s;ign, and a|greed
upon the means how to execute it.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;i&s;ted again&s;t two Irruptions, made
by the <HI>Fondins</HI> into the Country. The
fir&s;t was made about 17 Years after my
Arrival in the Country, and the other
was made the la&s;t year of my &s;tay there.
The <HI>Fondins</HI> a&s;&s;embled an Army of about
100000 Men, and attempted to break
through a Pa&s;&s;age that was not &s;o watch|fully
guarded as the re&s;t, 30000 of them
were already pa&s;&s;ing by favour of the
Night; and had it not been for the indi&s;|cretion
of &s;ome hot-headed Fools among
them that made a great noi&s;e, they had all
entred into the Country, before the <HI>Au|&s;tralians</HI>
could have perceived them; but
that noi&s;e having betrayed them, the <HI>Au|&s;tralians</HI>
&s;eeing the extream danger,
which they were in, doubled their &s;ignals,
in which ca&s;e all the <HI>Sezains</HI> are bound to
take Arms, and march with all Expediti|on
on to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; yet the <HI>Fondins,</HI>
who poared in in throngs, met with but
300 <HI>Australians,</HI> that firmly oppo&s;ed them;
but they did it &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they put
a &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a con&s;iderable while to a Party
of the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> Enemies; but at la&s;t, being &s;ur|rounded
on every &s;ide by the re&s;t of them
that were gotten further into the Country,
<PB N="142" REF="74">
they were all cut in pieces: But howe|ver,
by &s;elling their Lives &s;o dear, and
keeping the Enemy in play for above Two
Hours, they gave the two <HI>Sezains</HI> time to
come up with them; &s;o that while the
re&s;t were ju&s;t defeated, another fre&s;h Bo|dy
of about 1500 Men was drawn toge|ther
to di&s;pute their pa&s;&s;age any further;
the <HI>Fondins</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed over the Bellies
of the fir&s;t Party, threw them&s;elves into
the Country, to the number of above
60000, crying out, <HI>Ham, Ham,</HI> which in
their Tongue, is <HI>Victory, Victory.</HI> Notwith|&s;tanding
which, the 1500 <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> kept
them&s;elves in a Body as firm as a Rock,
forming a front on all &s;ides of them; but
the <HI>Fondins</HI> &s;urrounding them at la&s;t, made
a mo&s;t horrible &s;laughter of them.</P>
<P>In the mean while the day began to
break, and a Party of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> being
ob&s;tinately &s;et upon, defeating the &s;aid
1500 <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> kindled Fires round a|bout
them, either to burn them, or hin|der
them at lea&s;t from e&s;caping: But the
re&s;t of the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> which cam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> run|ning
thither from all parts, formed at la&s;t
a Body of 25000 Men, among whom I
was; and dividing them&s;elves into three
parts, and lea&s;t of them, which con&s;i&s;ted
of between 5 and 6000 Men, endeavoured
<PB N="143" REF="74">
to &s;eize the pa&s;&s;age, by which the <HI>Fondins</HI>
made their Irruption; the <HI>Fondins</HI> appre|hen&s;ive
of &s;uch a De&s;ign, had left 20000
Men to guard it, who charged the <HI>Au|&s;tralians</HI>
with &s;o much fury for five Hours
together, that they would have totally
defeated them, if it had not been for a
Re-inforcement of 3000 Men, who came
in, and maintained the Fight five Hours
longer, with a horrible Slaughter on both
&s;ides: During which time, the two other
Bodies fought with the &s;ame Vigour a|gain&s;t
the re&s;t of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> and the But|chery
was &s;o great in that place, that the
Field of Battle was become like a Ma&s;h of
Mortar, compo&s;ed of Earth and Blood, in
which the Combatants &s;unk up to the Knees;
and the <HI>Fondins,</HI> however, began already to
grow weary, when a new Reinforcement
of 20000 <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> arrived; who having
forced their way without much oppo&s;ition
through the <HI>Fondins,</HI> joyned our Troops:
And now, finding our &s;elves much &s;tronger
than our Enemies, we detached away
10000 Men to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our Bre|thren
at the pa&s;&s;age, a great many of
which were already knockt on the Head
by the <HI>Fondins,</HI> with great Stones, which
they threw down at them from the tops of
the Mountains, where they lay im Ambu|&s;cade.
<PB N="144" REF="75">
On our &s;ide, we having fre&s;h
Troops, renewed a fierce Fight again&s;t
Men that were already almo&s;t &s;pent,
which quickly forced them to give way,
and betake them&s;elves to flight; but when
they &s;aw the pa&s;&s;age &s;hut up again&s;t them,
and that they were inevitably lo&s;t, they
turned back upon us that were pur&s;uing
their Rear, and fighting like de&s;perate
Men, opened them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age thro'
our Troops, which were weary of killing
them.</P>
<P>And having thus forced their way thro'
us, they began to fly in di&s;order cro&s;s the
Country, di&s;per&s;ing them&s;elves on this
&s;ide, and that &s;ide, in the wide Fields.
The Fight la&s;ted till the middle of the
next Night; and as the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> that
&s;till were marching with fre&s;h Reinforce|ments
from all parts, met every where in
their pa&s;&s;age &s;ome flying <HI>Fondins,</HI> &s;till de|fending
them&s;elves with a great deal of
Bravery; but as &s;oon as they perceived
the approach of this new Reinforcement&punc;
they turned their backs, and fled. When
the Fight was over, the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> that
had fought, refre&s;ht and re&s;ted them&s;elves,
and the re&s;t took care to perform the la&s;t
Duties to the Brethren, who were killed
in the Battle: They found above 19000
<PB N="145" REF="75">
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> killed upon the place, and a|bout
12000 were wounded, in the num|ber
of which, I may reckon my &s;elf, &s;ince
I had an Arm broke, and one of my
Thighs run through: Each one knew
the Dead that belonged to him, and had
them carried back to their re&s;pective
Quarters. The nece&s;&s;ary orders were like|wi&s;e
given to convey all the Bodies of the
<HI>Fondins,</HI> to the place where they had
made their Irruption; and they found
of them above 90000, which they piled
up one upon another.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Battle of the <HI>Au|&s;tralians</HI>
again&s;t the <HI>Fondins,</HI> at which I
was pre&s;ent, and which I accordingly
de&s;cribe, as an Eye-witne&s;s: I could not
perceive they ob&s;erved any other Rule
on our &s;ide in their fighting, except it
were to re&s;olve to let them&s;elves be killed,
than to &s;uffer their Ranks to be broken:
As for their defen&s;ive Armour, they wear
a &s;ort of light Back and Brea&s;t Plate, as
thin as Paper, but yet &s;o hard, that no
blows that are not &s;truck at them with an
extraordinary vigour, are able to pierce
them. As for their Provi&s;ions for the
Mouth, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, they are &s;up|plied
every one in particular, from the
re&s;pective Quarter, or di&s;trict, to which
<PB N="146" REF="76">
he belonged, the Brethren carrying them
to their <HI>Hab</HI> in the Morning, and the Bre|thren
of the next <HI>Hab</HI> carrying them to
theirs, and then tho&s;e of the next to theirs,
and &s;o on, till they be conveyed to the
place where the Men are, for who&s;e u&s;e
the Fruit is de&s;igned.</P>
<P>The &s;econd <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Battle, in which
I was, happened 17 years after that, upon
the following occa&s;ion. The <HI>Fondins</HI> had
&s;eized upon a very con&s;iderable I&s;land, a|bout
10 Leagues from the <HI>Sezain,</HI> or Di|&s;trict
of Grief; it was about 18 Leagues in
length, and 14 in breadth, the Ground
there being very good, they had fortified
them&s;elves there, and were grown very po|pulous.
The mildne&s;s of the Air joyned
with the plenty and fruitfulne&s;s of the
place, drawing thither daily a confluence
of new Colonies, from whence they made
hold afterwards to make incur&s;ions into
the Continent of the <HI>Au&s;tralians;</HI> upon
which, tho&s;e People having taken a Re&s;o|lution
to drive them out of that I&s;land, they
wrote only to the 500 next <HI>Sezains,</HI> who
detached for that purpo&s;e each of them
400 Men, &s;o that in a trice they rai&s;ed an
Army of 200000 Men; they immediate-prepared
a kind of great flat Ferry-boat,
and built like a Platform, which contained
<PB N="147" REF="76">
300 Men in Front, and 400 on each &s;ide,
&s;o that it was capable of wafting over
12000 Men, ready ranged, in order of
Battel, which they made to be advanced
in that manner towards the I&s;land. Be|&s;ides
which, they equipped 600 other
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, that carried each 100 Men,
and 400 others, laden with Ammunition
and Provi&s;ions. Among&s;t all the Engines
of War, I &s;aw there, I took notice of one,
which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Ladders, which
&s;tuck certain pointed Irons into the Walls
of any Town they were applied again&s;t,
which by the help of a Spring, enlarged
them&s;elves like a hook, as &s;oon as they
had made their pa&s;&s;age into the Wall, and
then afterwards being turned about with
a Wheel, the&s;e Engines would &s;hake down,
and overthrow the &s;tronge&s;t Walls. I was
upon the Ferry-boat, or Platform, when
they began to advance again&s;t the <HI>Fondins,</HI>
which had been preparing them&s;elves for
three Months before, for a vigorous De|fence:
They were provided with all
&s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and their Army was
compo&s;ed of 300000 fighting Men, all re|&s;olved
to overcome, or die. In the mean
time, the <HI>Au&s;traliaas</HI> being come within
view of the I&s;land of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> made a
&s;top to con&s;ult which way they might be<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
<PB N="148" REF="77">
a&s;&s;ault their Enemies: And it was conclu|ded
in Council, that they &s;hould Land
20000 Men in the Night out of their
&s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, to &s;urround the I&s;land,
and to engage the <HI>Fondins</HI> to fight, whil&s;t
10000 more &s;hould throw them&s;elves into
the Water, and &s;wim over into the I&s;land
with the In&s;truments, nece&s;&s;ary to beat
down their Walls: which Re&s;olution was
executed with &s;o much Order and Celeri|ty,
that the <HI>Fondins</HI> had no time to be|think
them&s;elves how to prevent the blow.
The 10000 attackt the fir&s;t Wall; and ha|ving
beaten it down, 2000 of them &s;wam
over, and attacked the &s;econd Wall; in
which, when they had made &s;ome Breach|es,
the Sentinels hearing the noi&s;e, went,
and immediately alarmed the next Court
of Guard: But the Ardour of the <HI>Au&s;tra|lian</HI>
was &s;o great, that before their Enemies
could have notice of their Approach, they
had already pa&s;&s;ed to the number of 500
beyond the Wall, who kept firm in a Bo|dy
to cover the a&s;cent of the others, who
mounted with &s;uch a &s;urprizing Expediti|on,
that in an hours time, 20000 of them
pa&s;&s;ed over the Wall in &s;pite of all the op|po&s;ition
of the <HI>Fondins.</HI> In the mean
while, their King being informed that the
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> were in earne&s;t entring his I|&s;land,
<PB N="149" REF="77">
took with him 6000 cho&s;en Men out
of a Body of Re&s;erve, and advanced at
the head of them, to view the Enemy.
The <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> on their &s;ide gave mighty
Shouts to give notice to the re&s;t of their
party behind, that they had pa&s;&s;ed the
Wall, &s;o that when the <HI>Fondins</HI> had be|gun
an ob&s;tinate fight, the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> that
were not yet pa&s;&s;ed the Wall, climbed
upon all &s;ides, and in &s;pite of all the Re|&s;i&s;tance
the <HI>Fondins</HI> could make, &s;caled,
and pa&s;&s;ed it, to the number of 50000,
who made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of a part of
the Wall, as the day began to appear, up|on
which the Ve&s;&s;els advanced to the
Shoar, and Landed 20000 more, who like|wi&s;e
pa&s;&s;ed after their Companions over
the Walls; &s;o that the <HI>Fondins,</HI> who by
that time had got together above 100000
Men, &s;eeing the evident danger that
threatned them, drew them&s;elves all clo&s;e
up into one united Body, with a Re&s;olu|tion
to venture all for all, and fell &s;o
fiercely upon a Body of the Enemies
that made head again&s;t them, that
they would have entirely defeated

had beaten down above 200 Fathoms,
or 400 Yards of Wall, had not come up
timely to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was a
<PB N="150" REF="78">
Detachment of 6000 Soldiers from the
Platform; who being all fre&s;h, and in a
good condition, charged the <HI>Fondins</HI> in
the Rear, and made &s;uch a dreadful &s;laugh|ter
of them, that there hardly e&s;caped
2000, who fled, and &s;aved them&s;elves in
a &s;mall adjoyning Fortre&s;s, and &s;o the
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> became Ma&s;ters of the Field:
But however, before they would attack
the Fortre&s;&s;es that &s;tood further within
the I&s;land, they fir&s;t made &s;ure of all the
Pa&s;&s;ages and Outworks of it, that they
cut off all po&s;&s;ibility from the <HI>Fondins,</HI> of
e&s;caping their Hands: They &s;pent two
days in that work, and two more in look|ing
for the Bodies of the Brethren that
were &s;lain in the Fight, of which they
reckoned 42000, to whom they paid the
u&s;ual Honour of Burial; after which, they
likewi&s;e took the number of the <HI>Fondins</HI>
that were killed, which amounted to 12000.</P>
<P>When they had &s;o done, they marched
about to all the Towns in the I&s;land, and
took Five of them by A&s;&s;ault in one day,
mo&s;t unmercifully killing all they met.
And here I cannot but with Regret, take
notice to you, that I do not believe any
Country in the World can produce more
lovely and beautiful Women than there
were to be &s;een in this, which made me
<PB N="151" REF="78">
in &s;pight of all the Violence I u&s;ed to my
natural Inclination, in order to conform
my &s;elf to the cruel and pittile&s;s Cu&s;toms
and Proceedings of the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> not
able to forbear &s;hewing &s;ome Marks of
Compa&s;&s;ion, when I &s;aw the Throats of
&s;o many fair and charming Creatures, &s;o
mi&s;erably, and unmercile&s;ly cut, which
much &s;candalized tho&s;e Brethren that ob|&s;erved
my tenderne&s;s: but the matter was
much aggravated, when breaking into a
Hou&s;e that &s;eemed more con&s;iderable
than the re&s;t, I found in it a venerable
Matron, with two Daughters, of between
25 or 26 Years of Age, of a mo&s;t Accom|pli&s;h'd
Beauty, that threw them&s;elves down
at my Feet; for their Charms &s;o &s;trongly
Tran&s;ported me, that being almo&s;t bereft
of my Rea&s;on, and my Judgment, I incon|&s;iderately
advanced towards one of tho&s;e
young Ladies, whom I gra&s;ped Affecti|onately
in my Arms, to lift her up, when
two <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> came in, ju&s;t at that mo|ment,
and &s;urprized me in the Action.</P>
<P>I &s;aw by the Fire, that fla&s;ht in their
Eyes, and by the Indignation which ap|peared
in their Faces, that I was a lo&s;t
Man; neverthele&s;s they contented them|&s;elves
only with cutting the Throats of
tho&s;e Ladies in my Pre&s;ence, I knew not
<PB N="152" REF="79">
afterwards, neither what to re&s;olve up|on,
nor what would become of me, nor
dur&s;t I look an <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> in the Face;
and as &s;oon as any one came near me, I
held down my Eyes, and Confu&s;ion &s;hew|ed
it &s;elf in my Face. In this Perplexity,
I returned on Board to the Ve&s;&s;el, where
I feined my &s;elf wounded, that they might
not take it ill, that I had quitted the Ar|my,
and I remained, with a Spirit &s;o de|jected
and &s;ad, that I could &s;carce &s;up|port
my &s;elf. In the mean time, the plain
Country, and all the Towns being &s;cat|tered,
they re&s;olved to Attack the &s;trong
places, of which they inve&s;ted three at
once, and all the works of a Siege among
the&s;e People, being to dig the Earth round
about the place which they Attack, 300
Men were employed in that Work for
three days; at the end of which they
came to the Walls, notwith&s;tanding the
Sallies of the <HI>Fondins;</HI> then they under|mined
them, and di&s;mantled tho&s;e Cities
in a trice, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of
all the Inhabitants; they gave at the &s;ame
time a general A&s;&s;ault, and all the valour
of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> who defended them&s;elves
very Couragiou&s;ly, did not hinder them
from taking the &s;trong places in four
days time: The &s;laughter was there
<PB N="153" REF="79">
general, and they &s;pared neither Women,
old People, nor Children, all were en|veloped
in one common Ma&s;&s;acre; tho&s;e
that were in the other Fortre&s;&s;es, did
not &s;tay to be Be&s;ieged, they went out
the Night before they were to be in|ve&s;ted,
and the next day, were
to be &s;een on the Banks of the Sea, more
than 200000 People, of all Ages and
Sexes, &s;ome of which threw them&s;elves
head-long into the Water, others ca&s;t
them&s;elves upon the Mercy of their E|nemies,
others with Hands lifted up to
Heaven, expected Death, which they
&s;aw inevitable.</P>
<P>Thus this fine I&s;land was di&s;peopled,
the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> collected into many heaps
the Bodies of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> and left them
upon the Banks of the Sea, without bury|ing,
expo&s;ing them to the Birds, who
devoured them. Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>Au&s;tra|lians,</HI>
who were killed at the fir&s;t A&s;|&s;ault
of the I&s;le (of which we have
&s;poken) there was found 18000 more,
which were tran&s;ported out of the Coun|try
upon many Ve&s;&s;els: they carried
back the Wounded in the &s;ame man|ner,
which were to the number of
30000 Men.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="80">
As the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> are very dilligent at
the <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> of <HI>Hab,</HI> and of <HI>Heb,</HI> as well
at home, as abroad, &s;o &s;oon as the I&s;le
was taken, they met together, to prai&s;e
God, and to con&s;ider of &s;everal other Af|fairs,
of which the principal were how to
di&s;po&s;e of me, and how to de&s;troy the

every one of which de&s;erved death;
and having had my hearing, I was &s;ent

came to a re&s;olution to demoli&s;h the
I&s;land, with two Armies of fifty Thou|&s;and

ma&s;&s;e of Earth was de&s;troyed, and co|vered
with Water, in ten of their Months.
A Work which the <HI>Europeans</HI> could never
have fini&s;hed in ten Years, and which is
more, would never have dared to under|taken.
This is what I have &s;een of the
War between the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> and the
<HI>Fondins.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Enemies, the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI>
have tho&s;e to fight withal, which they
call <HI>Sea-Mon&s;ters;</HI> this is the Name they
give the <HI>Europeans,</HI> becau&s;e they are ig|norant
of their Country, and they never
&s;ee them come but by Sea in Ships. They
<PB N="155" REF="80">
never call them any thing el&s;e but <HI>Sea-Monsters,</HI>
or <HI>Half-men.</HI> The old Philo|&s;opher,
who was &s;o much my Friend,
and who took &s;uch delight, a little be|fore
he died, to hear me talk of my
Country, told me, That he had &s;een
&s;ome People approach their Coa&s;ts, who
were made ju&s;t after the proportion that
I &s;poke of; that he admired the Fabrick
of their Ships, and that he was always
de&s;irous to know more of the Country of
the&s;e <HI>Half-men,</HI> and that he found a
great deal of plea&s;ure in what I had told
him, and what he believed before.</P>
<P>He told me, among other Di&s;putes
which they had had with the&s;e <HI>Half-men,</HI>
they had at one time met with &s;o re&s;olute
Men, that they were three whole Days
before they could take Seven of their
Ships: I &s;aw the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els upon the
Shoar; for the <HI>Australians</HI> keep all their
Prizes, as Trophies of their Glory and Va|lour.</P>
<P>When I came thither, about &s;ix Months
before, they had defeated a whole Fleet
of them; and I &s;aw a great many Bo|dies
hung upon the Ma&s;ts, whom by
their Cloaths, I know to be <HI>French, Spa|niards,</HI>
and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> My old Man,
who &s;aw the Battle, told me, he never
<PB N="156" REF="81">
&s;aw the like of it, except what I did a|gain&s;t
the wild Birds. The Pilot having
ob&s;erved &s;ome little Rivolets of Water
deep enough, came up within half a Mile
of the Shoar, but not finding there but
two Foot of Water, he was forced to
&s;top; he immediately cau&s;ed a Thou&s;and
Men to Land, to view the Country. They
came with a great deal of bravery, and
ea&s;ily forced the Sea-Guards, who pre|&s;ently
gave the Signal, the Enemy were
come. But the Enemy having boarded
a <HI>Sezain</HI> which they met, and falling a
plundering, the Sea-Guards did &s;o re|double
their Signals, that before the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI>
could have done plundering, there
appeared eight Thou&s;and <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI>
upon the Shoar. The <HI>Europeans</HI> fired a
great many pieces of Cannon, but few
did Execution. In the mean time the
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> &s;urrounded tho&s;e-few that had
landed, in a little Hou&s;e, which they
had before forced open, and in which
they defended them&s;elves for &s;ome time,
but at la&s;t they were forced to &s;ubmit to
Number, and not one Man e&s;caped to
carry the News to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> After that
the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> made a con&s;iderable turn
to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age of the River, in
which they are admirable, by filling dex|trou&s;ly
<PB N="157" REF="81">
the Mouth of the River with &s;uch
heaps of Earth, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for
the Enemy of pa&s;s. After this, they en|deavoured
to board them, but the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI>
made &s;o good u&s;e of their Cannon
and &s;mall Arms, that of eight Thou&s;and
<HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> there was &s;ix Thou&s;and kil|led
before one Man could board them.
And my old Man a&s;&s;ured me, that he ne|ver
had &s;een &s;o much bravery in any of
their Enemies. Notwith&s;tanding all this,
the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> being con&s;tantly &s;upplied
with fre&s;h Men, they began a new At|tack
with twelve Thou&s;and Men, who
were very bravely received, but not with
&s;uch a lo&s;s as the former; they boarded
the Ships with a wonderful courage; yet
the <HI>Europeans</HI> firing from all parts upon
them, they had killed above four Thou|&s;and,
when on a &s;uddain the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI>
were reinforced with two Thou&s;and
fre&s;h Men, who finding the Enemy al|ready
quite fatigued, immediately de|feated
them. There was in all, three
Thou&s;and Seamen, and as many Soldiers,
who had all their Throats cut, in le&s;s than
an Hour.</P>
<P>But the ordinary Fights which the <HI>Au|&s;tralians</HI>
have again&s;t the Birds, of which
we have &s;poken, are much more trou|ble&s;ome;
<PB N="158" REF="82">
becau&s;e coming, and going by
the Air, there is no means neither to
&s;top, nor de&s;troy them. They fight a|gain&s;t
the&s;e terrible <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> three &s;everal
ways; becau&s;e they are attacked by them
in as many; for &s;ometimes they hide
them&s;elves in the <HI>Trees,</HI> &s;ometimes they
fly out of &s;ight, to throw them&s;elves upon
their Prey in a Minute. The little <HI>Birds,</HI>
of which I have &s;poke before, will per|ceive
them a great way off, and &s;trike
their <HI>Bills</HI> with &s;everal doleful cries, to
give notice to the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> to put
them&s;elves upon their Guard. Yet the&s;e
<HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all their precau|tions,
&s;eldom mi&s;s their blow. I remem|ber
once, as I was going to <HI>Heb,</HI> in the
company of my Philo&s;opher, armed ac|cording
to our cu&s;tom, with Halberts,
Ca&s;ques, and Cuira&s;&s;es, after our mode,
we had &s;carce gone half our way, when
the little Birds began to cry, and fly a|bout
us, in a frightful manner, to give
us notice of our danger. In &s;hort, we
immediately perceived &s;ome of the&s;e
great <HI>Birds,</HI> who came to attack us. We
then crowded one upon the other, cove|ring
our &s;elves with our Arms, and ma|king
our &s;elves ready for defence. One
of the&s;e dreadful <HI>Beasts</HI> &s;natched my Hal|bert
<PB N="159" REF="82">
out of my hand, with a force no
man alive was able to re&s;i&s;t. The other
five fell &s;o furiou&s;ly upon my Compani|ons,
that they had an incredible difficul|ty
to &s;ave them&s;elves; and ju&s;t as I tur|ned
my Head, to &s;ee how I might come
to their help, I my &s;elf was carried off;
and I had been infallibly lo&s;t, if five of
my other brethren had not come to my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and cleared me from the claws
of the <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> that held me. But then many
more of our brethren coming in, the
Birds flew away.</P>
<P>But that which is mo&s;t terrible is, that
the&s;e horrible <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves
&s;ometimes to the number of four, or five
hundred, forming a body of an Army;
where it &s;eems they ob&s;erve a &s;ort of a
Di&s;cipline, in their Combats with the
<HI>Au&s;tralians.</HI> They Camp in all places in|differently
where they find Food. The
<HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> canton them&s;elves into their
Hou&s;es, none dare &s;tir out; they put up
the Signal to give notice, that the Ene|my
is there, and every one to take care
of them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="83">
The Regularity, which they ob&s;erve
to fight with the&s;e Birds, is greater than
that which they ob&s;erve to fight the
<HI>Fondins;</HI> they &s;tand clo&s;e togehter, and
&s;o order it, that they have a Front on
every &s;ide. They have their <HI>Sarbecans,</HI>
of which I &s;poke before; in &s;hort, they
are made of Halberts and Cutlaces:
So &s;oon as the Birds perceive them co|ming
again&s;t them, they &s;eperate them|&s;elves,
&s;ome flying on one &s;ide, and &s;ome
on the other, the greate&s;t part of them
out of &s;ight; but this is only to joyn
them&s;elves the clo&s;er, to fall together
upon the <HI>Au&s;tralians;</HI> who, notwith|&s;tanding
all their Precautions, always
lo&s;e &s;ome Men in their fir&s;t Attacks.
I was pre&s;ent at three Fights with them,
we lo&s;t at the fir&s;t 6 Men, at the &s;e|cond
eight, at the third three; and in
the three Fights altogether we killed but
&s;even of the Birds. It is impo&s;&s;ible to
tell you with what force they fall upon
Men, and what furious &s;trokes they will
give with their Bills; I &s;aw an Action in
the la&s;t Combat, that's worth relating,
An <HI>Urg</HI> took away the Halbert of one
of my Companions, and another &s;eized
his Per&s;on; I would have defended him
with my Halbert, but a third <HI>Urg</HI> car|ried
<PB N="161" REF="83">
him off: my Neighbour &s;tuck to
him, and the &s;ame <HI>Bird</HI> carried away
both: Another took hold of one of
them, but another <HI>Urg</HI> threw him&s;elf
furiou&s;ly at him; and as he was carry|ing
him of, I joyned my &s;elf to him to
&s;top him, but we had all four been carried
off, if we had not knocked down one
of the <HI>Birds,</HI> for the others immediately
quitted us after that, and we found one
of the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> which they let fall
dead and &s;trangled, by being pinched
too hard by them; they ob&s;erve that
when the Sea hath been Tempe&s;tuous
for four or five days, the&s;e <HI>Birds</HI> are in
a &s;ort of a rage, becau&s;e they cannot
take the Fi&s;h, which they do at other
times for their u&s;ual Nouri&s;hment. I
have told you before, that the <HI>Au&s;trali|ans</HI>
have, and do yet continue to make
extraordinary Efforts to de&s;troy the&s;e
terrible Enemies. They demoli&s;hed 30
Years ago three con&s;iderable I&s;lands,
where the&s;e <HI>Birds</HI> harbour, of two Leagues
in length, and at pre&s;ent they are about
de&s;troying another that is &s;ix Leagues
from their Country. The mo&s;t proper
&s;ea&s;on for this is the Tropick of <HI>Capri|corn,</HI>
and they continue to the Aequinox
of <HI>March,</HI> at which time <HI>Birds</HI> beginning
<PB N="162" REF="84">
to grow warm, begin their threatning,
but without effect, till the Sun enters
into the Sign of <HI>Taurus.</HI> 'Tis then that
they come to Attack the <HI>Au&s;tralians</HI> in
Troops, with &s;o much fury, that what|ever
they are able to do, cannot hinder
them from lo&s;ing &s;everal Men; the heat
of the&s;e Engagements will &s;ometimes
continue for &s;ix Hours together, with|out
intermi&s;&s;ion for thirty Days, and
after that, they go away by &s;mall Par|cels,

and Intere&s;ts of the <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI>
with the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> that I owed
the Pre&s;ervation of my Life to nothing

and to the continual violence I did

litving, and to the Care the good old Man
took of me, who was always my Prote|ctor;
notwith&s;tanding this, as our nature
will &s;hew it &s;elf, what-ever Di&s;gui&s;es we
put <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> there often fell from me &s;ome
Words or Actions, which &s;hewed what I
really was. The good old Philo&s;opher
made an hundred Harangues in my De|fence,
<PB N="164" REF="85">
while he was alive, and to &s;top
the De&s;igns that their Brothers had form|ed
again&s;t me; he &s;et out my fighting as
an unheard of Prodigy, and which alone
rendered me worthy of their Protection,
notwith&s;tanding all my faults. He main|tained
that &s;ince they had taken me
into their Protection, though I was a
Stranger, they could not now take a|way
my Life without manife&s;t Inju&s;tice,
&s;ince what I did ami&s;s proceeded from
my Nature; he added after all, that
&s;ince I was a Stranger, they ought not
to condemn me till they could hear
what I could &s;ay in my own defence.
When he died, he redoubled his En|treaties,
and Rea&s;ons, to oblidge them
to pre&s;erve me, and named me to be
his Lieutenant, after an Exhortation,
truly paternal, which he made to me,
and all the Brothers accepted it, with
their common Con&s;ent. In fine, he
&s;upported me till the War of the <HI>Fon|dins,</HI>
of which I have &s;poke, where my
ruin was fixed, and re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>The Accu&s;ation that was formed a|gain&s;t
me, may be reduced to five
principal heads: The fir&s;t was, that I
had not fought with the others, &s;ince I
<PB N="165" REF="85">
could not produce an Ear of the <HI>Fon|dins:</HI>
Secondly, That I had te&s;tified a
great Grief, in &s;eeing the De&s;truction of
their Enemies: Thirdly, That I had
embraced a <HI>Fundine:</HI> Fourthly, That I
had eaten the Meat of the <HI>Fundines:</HI>
and la&s;tly, That I had made Que&s;tions
full of Malice to the Brothers. To
under&s;tand the&s;e Accu&s;ations, you mu&s;t
know, that it is a Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Au&s;tra|lians</HI>
to cut off the Ears of tho&s;e that they
kill in fight, and make a Girdle of them;
he that brings mo&s;t is e&s;teemed mo&s;t
Couragious; and there was &s;ome that
in the taking of the I&s;land, that brought
off 200.</P>
<P>As for my part, I was &s;o far from ha|ving
killed any of them, that I te&s;tified an
extream regret, to &s;ee the bloody <HI>Butchery</HI>
of tho&s;e unhappy People; I have told you
already of the tenderne&s;s which I &s;hewed
to a pretty <HI>Fondin</HI> Lady, whom I found in
an Hou&s;e with her Mother. The <HI>Au&s;trali|ans,</HI>
looked upon this as the greate&s;t crime
I could commit, and there was none of
them afterwards but abhorred me.</P>
<P>They charged me be&s;ides, that I had
the boldne&s;s ro propo&s;e the Pre&s;ervation
of &s;ome of the <HI>Fundines</HI> Women, to be
<PB N="166" REF="86">
made u&s;e of as Slaves, and that I had
openly declared, that I preferred the Life
of one <HI>Fondin</HI> Woman, before all the
Booty I could pretend to in the I&s;land.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as they had heard the&s;e Ac|cu&s;ations
again&s;t me, they propo&s;ed to
Death to me, but with &s;o imperious an
Air, that I had nothing el&s;e to do but to
accept of it: And for as much as they
kept a great &s;ilence, when I came to the
Table to eat, according to the Cu&s;tom&punc;
I began to &s;peak, and told the Brothers
a&s;&s;embled, that I had &s;uch e&s;&s;ential Obli|gations
to them, that I could not leave
them without communicating to them a
grand Secret, which I had for the ea&s;ie
De&s;truction of the <HI>Urges</HI> I added, that I
was really guilty of the Crimes of which
I was accu&s;ed; but &s;ince all tho&s;e crimes
came from my nature, which all Peo|ple
knew to be like that of the <HI>Fundins;</HI>
I appeal to their Con&s;ciences, if being
re&s;olved to &s;uffer me to live among
them, knowing me for a <HI>Fundine;</HI> they
ought not al&s;o to pardon tho&s;e faults,
which were in&s;eparable from tho&s;e of my
Species: Its true, &s;aid I, that I have te|&s;tified
a great deal of kindne&s;s to tho&s;e Peo|ple
that were like me; it is true, that I could
<PB N="167" REF="86">
cut their Throats; 'tis true, that I &s;hew'd
a compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e who are even as
my &s;elf: And if I had not done this, I
mu&s;t have renounced my nature, and
their own Rea&s;on, which Judges &s;o well
of things, would have ju&s;tly condemned
me of cruelty.</P>
<P>If an <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> &s;hould happen to be a|mong&s;t
the <HI>Fundines,</HI> would not he be in|excu&s;able,
if in a War again&s;t his own
Nation, he &s;hew'd not &s;ome kindne&s;s to
them. But after all, do not believe that
I am &s;o de&s;irous to pre&s;erve my life, I am
glad to retire, I only demand a delay of
a few days, to have time to &s;hew you,
that this poor Stranger, whom you have
protected, is not ungrateful for the bene|fits
received of you.</P>
<P>They went out of the <HI>Hab,</HI> according
to the accu&s;tomed manner, without gi|ving
any An&s;wer, &s;o that I &s;aw I had no
other way left, but indu&s;triou&s;ly to &s;tudy
out &s;ome way of returning into my own
Country. In this cogitation, all the Ad|ventures
of my former Voyage, which
brought me to the place where I now
was, ran in my mind. I had always be|fore
my Eyes the opportunity which was
&s;o favourable to me; and I imagined, that
<PB N="168" REF="87">
if I could, after any fa&s;hion, &s;hift away
from the &s;ight of the&s;e <HI>Au&s;tralians,</HI> my re|turn
would be &s;ecured; and after I had
revovled in my mind, a great many &s;e|veral
methods and de&s;igns, this was the
Re&s;olution which I took and executed. I
made a Cord of the bark of a Tree,
which is named <HI>S chuch;</HI> I rubbed it with
the juice of the Fruit <HI>Repo&s;e,</HI> mingled with
a little Sea-Water, which render'd it as
hard as Iron; I afterward rubbed it with
another Juice, which made it flexible,
and at la&s;t made a kind of Rope, which
I tied fa&s;t to a Tree, where the <HI>Urgs</HI> u&s;ed
to perch; I never cea&s;ed to go and come,
expecting with impatience the &s;ucce&s;s
which I had promi&s;ed my &s;elf from this
de&s;ign. At la&s;t my little Birds having ad|verti&s;ed
me to retire, I &s;aw two <HI>Urgs</HI> ve|ry
high in the Air, which lighted exactly
upon the Tree where I had &s;tretched my
Cord, and one of them was taken by the
end of the Foot.</P>
<P>The Brothers, who &s;aw that he was ta|ken,
ran pre&s;ently to knock him down;
but I entreated them to let me alone with
him, a&s;&s;uring them, that they &s;hould in
a little while &s;ee &s;omething more &s;urpri|&s;ing
than what they now beheld.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="87">
My Bea&s;t &s;eeing him&s;elf taken, con|tinued
two days in a very ill humour
when I approached him, but at la&s;t, when
he &s;aw no appearance of e&s;caping, and
that hunger and famine pre&s;&s;ed him, he
begun to be more gentle, and to &s;uffer
me to approach to give him meat; I fed
him all alone, and he began to know
me; I made much of him, and he &s;uffer|ed
it; I lift up his huge Feet, I looked
upon his Talons, I opened his Beak, and
mounted upon his Back: In fine, I did
what&s;oever I would with him: I &s;aid
then to my &s;elf, &s;ince I was fir&s;t driven
into this Countrey by the per&s;ecution of
the&s;e Bea&s;ts, why may I not depart
hence too by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance? I had
great hope of my Bird, and my hope in|crea&s;ed
as his kindne&s;s increa&s;ed to|wards
me.</P>
<P>In the mean time they &s;poke of my
Conduct at the <HI>HAB</HI> with prai&s;e, and
&s;eeing that they admired it, I made a &s;peech
and told them, that I begun now to look
upon my &s;elf as one who&s;e being was in
a manner ceas'd; that &s;ince it was the
Cu&s;tom of our Nation, that when any
one was at the point of Death, to live
with great Re&s;ervedne&s;s, and that my
&s;pirit would not permit me to be the
<PB N="170" REF="88">
&s;ame that I had been, and that knowing
that I &s;hould cea&s;e to be in a little time,
I would employ the Moments that re|mained
to &s;tudy out &s;ome la&s;t action
which &s;hould edifie them much more
than my fir&s;t. The&s;e Rea&s;ons did very
much &s;atisfie the A&s;&s;embly, and they
were re&s;olved to let me fini&s;h my Life
as I plea&s;ed, without &s;peaking any more
either of my words or actions. And &s;ince
I ought to be reckoned in the number
of the dead, they them&s;elves named me
Lieutenant, and regarded me no more
but as a dying per&s;on, who was at Liber|ty
to fini&s;h his Life as him&s;elf thought fit.
This Order gave me &s;o much con&s;olation,
that I then looked upon my deliverance
for mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the whole day with my
Bird, and I omitted no way to &s;hew him
all the kindne&s;s I po&s;&s;ibly could. I per|ceived
one day that he had a great pain,
and I found that the Cord which &s;et|ter'd
him had cut the skin of his Foot,
and was entred a good way into his fle&s;h;
the wound was very con&s;iderable, and I
u&s;ed all means po&s;&s;ible to cure him; I
poured in the Juice of a Fruit to con&s;oli|date
the wound, I bound it up hand&s;omly,
and in eight days he became perfectly
<PB N="171" REF="88">
well. His kindne&s;s upon this augmented
&s;o much towards me, that he would not
&s;uffer me to go from him: And I on the
other &s;ide was never content but when
I was with him: I let him by little and
little go loo&s;e alone, and he was &s;o far
from flying away, that he made conti|nual
Efforts to follow me every where:
I was de&s;irous to try whether he could
carry me flying, and I found that he did
it with plea&s;ure, and a &s;urprizing &s;wift|ne&s;s.
After this I made a Girdle of many
Leaves, which I rubbed with the Juice
of the Fruit of Repo&s;e, to make it of
proof again&s;t Water; I made afterward
a kind of Bag, and having filled it with
the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing Fruits of the Coun|trey,
and &s;ome Bottles of the Liquor
which they drink there, with which I
put al&s;o the <HI>Manu&s;cript of this Hi&s;tory,</HI> I
put them all up very neatly, and girded
them round about me.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, I made a little Wallet
which I filled with Fruit for the nouri&s;h|ment
of my Bea&s;t, and have tied it neat|ly
upon his back, I re&s;olved to depart
the night following, which was the
15th of the <HI>Sol&s;tice</HI> of <HI>Capricorn</HI> 35 years
and &s;ome months after my fir&s;t arrival
into the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Countrey, and in the
<PB N="172" REF="89">
Fifty &s;eventh year of mine Age.</P>
<P>That my Bird then might the more
ea&s;ily take his flight, I made him get up
upon a Tree, and &s;eating my &s;elf under
his wings, I made him begin his flight
very high in the Air, for fear of being
perceived by tho&s;e that guarded the Sea,
but the great Cold of the middle Re|gion
of the Air quickly obliged me to de|&s;cend
a little lower.</P>
<P>In the mean time we had been above
&s;ix mile already on our way, whether
my Bea&s;t became again &s;en&s;ible of his
wound, or whether too long a re&s;t had
rendred him more heavy, I perceived he
was extreamly fatigued, and could hold
out no longer: I then &s;o ordered him
to light down upon the Water, and as he
&s;unk a little too deep, I leaped off to
ea&s;e him, well knowing that my Girdle
would &s;upport me, and keep me out of
danger. This poor Animal fearing then
that I would be lo&s;t, or would quit him,
began to cry and turn towards me with
an agitation that &s;hewed his pain and un|ea&s;ine&s;s;
but being my &s;elf more weary
than he, I leaned my head upon his
Feathers, and having given him &s;ome of
the Fruits in the Wallet, I fell into a
&s;ound &s;leep. I found the day very fine
<PB N="173" REF="89">
and clear at my awaking, and made my
Bird eat again, and took a Repa&s;t my
&s;elf; I mounted again upon him nimbly
enough, with de&s;ign to advance the more
&s;wiftly on our way: But what&s;oever
Efforts he made, he was never able to
take his flight, becau&s;e the &s;trange hea|vine&s;s
of my body made him &s;ink too
low in the Water; we were forced then,
whether we would or no, to remain in
the place where we now were, and any
one may judge what pain and trouble I
was then in: Neverthele&s;s, having con|&s;idered
that my Bea&s;t went very well,
and &s;wiftly in the Water, I tied my
&s;elf to his Tail, and he drew me far
enough to di&s;cover a little I&s;land which
appeared almo&s;t out of &s;ight. As the
night approached, and my Bird being ve|ry
weary, I &s;taid to feed him, and eat
my &s;elf al&s;o with him; but I was very
much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee him &s;top &s;hort;
for whether it was that he regretted his
former condition, or whether he could
not live in a different Air from that of
his own Climate, or whether he was
only concerned at the trouble he &s;aw me
in, he would not &s;tir a bit further. Night
came upon us a little after, and he &s;lept
&s;oundly, but I could not &s;o much as &s;hut
<PB N="174" REF="90">
mine Eyes: I deliberated a long time
upon what I &s;hould do, and after a great
many thoughts, I judged it mo&s;t conve|nient
to &s;lip the Wallet from off his
back, and to &s;eparate my &s;elf entirely
from him, though with a great deal of
regret.</P>
<P>After I had done this, &s;eeing my
Girdle and my Bag &s;upported me per|fectly
well, I began to go away from my
Bea&s;t, and to go forward by the favour
of a South-wind which a&s;&s;i&s;ted me; in&s;o|much
that at Day-break I found my &s;elf
arrived without any inconvenience in
the I&s;land which I di&s;covered the night
before.</P>
<P>Then I went out of the Water, and
&s;at me down upon the Land, and I eat
&s;ome of my fruit, with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible
plea&s;ure tempered with that con&s;olation
that I never yet enjoy'd the like. Sleep
&s;eized me afterwards, and I &s;lept about
&s;ix hours, and waking I re&s;olved to con|tinue
my Voyage, and to advance, al|ways
bearing towards the North, for
fear of being in danger to be lo&s;t in the
Great Sea which &s;eparates the <HI>Old World
from the New.</HI> But I was &s;carce got in|to
the Water when I heard the noi&s;e of
the flying of the Great Birds which I have
<PB N="175" REF="90">
&s;poken of. My very Heart trembled at
this noi&s;e, and I thought my &s;elf lo&s;t at
fir&s;t, but my fear was pre&s;ently turned
into joy, when I found that it was my
own Bea&s;t that was looking for me,
and who came to ca&s;t him&s;elf at my Feet
with &s;o many care&s;&s;es and &s;o many marks
of &s;orrow becau&s;e I had left him: I was
touched with the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ion
that ever I had in my life, and becau&s;e
I knew he had tired him&s;elf very much
in &s;eeking me, I &s;taid in the I&s;land a Day
and a Night, to re&s;t, and gave him &s;ome
fruits out of my Wallet; he had &s;carce
begun to Eat when ten great Bea&s;ts, al|mo&s;t
of the colour of our Wolves came
up towards us&punc; My Bird who perceived
them before me, &s;et upon them with
great impetuo&s;ity and fury, and taking
up one and carrying it up into the Air, he
let it fall upon another and knockt it on
the Head, upon which all the re&s;t imme|diately
fled, but before they could get to
their Holes, he catched a third, of which
he eat half and brought the re&s;t to me.
The night following I &s;lept with him &s;ix
or &s;even hours, but my Bird did not &s;leep
till after me, and awaked very near as
&s;oon as I; He no &s;ooner had his Eyes
open, but he fell upon one of the Bea&s;ts
<PB N="176" REF="91">
that he had &s;lain and made his breakfa&s;t
of it: I eat al&s;o &s;ome of my fruits, and
pre&s;ently got upon a little Rock and
mounted his Back as before, we advanced
with a &s;urprizing &s;wiftne&s;s, and had made
a great deal of way, when two Birds of
the &s;ame bigne&s;s came to encounter us,
and launching them&s;elves again&s;t us, be|gan
to attack us with great blows, of
their Beaks and Talons. It was impo&s;&s;i|ble
for this poor Creature to make his
part good, as well becau&s;e his burden
put him out of a &s;tate of defence as that
the two Birds were each of them as
&s;trong as him&s;elf; I had received already
&s;ome blows which made me all bloody,
and al&s;o &s;eeing that we were both of us in
equal danger, and that in hindering him
to &s;ave his life, I could not &s;ecure mine
own, I leaped off from his back, and ca&s;t
my &s;elf into the Water, where I lay
&s;ome time to look upon the Combat; My
Bird held him&s;elf upon the defen&s;ive, and
contented him&s;elf to pre&s;ent his Talons
and his Beak to guard off the blows as
much as he could. But at la&s;t a mi&s;t
which begun to &s;pread it &s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly
quite deprived me of the &s;ight of this
&s;pectacle. I fell then into a deep grief,
and made many reflections upon my un|happy
<PB N="177" REF="91">
E&s;tate, and I was reduced to it by
mine own fault.</P>
<P><HI>Au&s;tralia</HI> repre&s;ented it &s;elf to me
with all its advantages, and the I&s;land
which I had newly left, &s;eemed to me
extremely Commodious, and I thought
I might have pa&s;t the re&s;t of my Days
there without fear or danger, becau&s;e
my Bird would have guarded me again&s;t
all that dur&s;t attacque me. I then re|membred
that I was the cau&s;e of mine
own unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P>That which compleated my misfortune
was, that I knew not what to do, not be|ing
able to &s;ee thirty yards before me.
The&s;e &s;ad thoughts perplexed my mind,
when I heard a great noi&s;e like a Ship that
&s;pread all its Sails, I begun to cry out,
when I was perceived by the Marriners
who &s;hot at me, and I was wounded in
many places, but &s;lightly.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Ve&s;&s;el approach|ing,
they knew by my voice and my
actions, that I was a man&punc; they took me
on board, and u&s;ed me with great com|pa&s;&s;ion,
they looked upon my wounds,
and wa&s;hed them with Oil and Wine
and having poured upon them a precious
Balm they bound them up very neatly.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e they appeared to be Europe|ans
<PB N="178" REF="92">
I &s;poke Latine to them, I under&s;tood
that they were French, and that their
Ve&s;&s;el parted a little while ago from the
I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> with de&s;ign to crui&s;e
for a booty.</P>
<P>The Captain who was a man of quali|ty
having under&s;tood that I was an Eu|ropean
came to &s;ee me, and &s;poke to me
with a great deal of kindne&s;s, gave me
a &s;uit of his apparel, took me into his
Company, and made me eat at his Table.
The fir&s;t entertainment I had with him
la&s;ted for three hours. I recounted to him
the Hi&s;tory of my Birth, of my Education,
of my Shipwracks, and of my Arrival in
<HI>Au&s;tralia.</HI> He heard me with a great deal
of attention, &amp; was a&s;toni&s;h'd that I could
&s;urvive &s;o many evils that I had &s;uffered.
I heard that he &s;poke in French to the
Company all that I had &s;aid in Latin, and
all of them admired that I &s;hould e&s;cape
&s;o many dangers. He had afterwards
the di&s;cretion to let me eat without ask|ing
me any more que&s;tions; But &s;ince
I had lo&s;t the u&s;e of the European meats,
I found no ta&s;te in them, and my &s;tomach
would &s;carce endure them. I took then
of my Fruits which begun to wax old, and
my little Bottles which began to dry, I
offered one to the Captain who ta&s;ted it,
<PB N="179" REF="92">
and prote&s;ted that he had never drank any
thing &s;o delicious. He de&s;ired a &s;econd
of me, and drank to the Mr. Pilot, he
would have a third, and afterwards a
fourth, and never cea&s;ed, till my Girdle
was quite empty. There was no body
but admired both the colour and delica|cy
of the Fruits, and they could &s;carce
believe they were natural.</P>
<P>Our Repa&s;t being over, I was obliged
to begin my Hi&s;tory again, and recount
as well as I could po&s;&s;ibly, the particu|lars
of the <HI>Au&s;tralian</HI> Countrey, the Man|ners
and Cu&s;toms of the Inhabitants,
and the re&s;t. The Captain was at a
great lo&s;s to believe me, but I reported
&s;o many circum&s;tances of the things
which I advanced, that he could no lon|ger
doubt of it. He oftentimes prote&s;t|ed
that he would willingly run the dan|ger
of his Life to &s;ee tho&s;e things which
I had &s;een. And upon what I &s;aid to
him concerning the Situation and
Bounds of the Countrey, he declared
that he &s;aw plainly that his Friends
who were gone thither would infal|libly
peri&s;h.</P>
<P>In the mean time having re&s;olved to
return to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> we &s;et Sail, and
after eight days &s;ailing, we arrived at
<PB N="180" REF="93">
the Port of <HI>Tombolo,</HI> which is &s;ome|thing
Southerly to the I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;|car,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, South-we&s;t. The
Captain had a great kindne&s;s for me,
and would have let me leave him, to
gratifie the Governour of <HI>Tombolo,</HI> who
had a mind to &s;ee me.</P>

<P><HI>TOmbolo</HI> is a Port that hath a little
City indifferently &s;trong, in which
there is about five or &s;ix thou&s;and Inha|bitants,
of which the greater part are
<HI>French,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Portugals,</HI> others <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
and a very few <HI>Hollanders;</HI> the re&s;t are
the Natives of the Countrey, who are
very hard to be civiliz'd. It is under the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> in the 65th Me|ridian,
according to <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This Coun|trey
is not only barren, but unhealthful,
&s;o far as I am able to judge. They have
no provi&s;ion but what is brought from
other places, and the natural Inhabitants
of the Countrey are not yet &s;ubjected,
<PB N="181" REF="93">
nor have any fixed abode. Here again
I recounted my Hi&s;tory at length to the
Governour, and had many Conferences
with him, yet being tired with &s;taying
&s;o long for a Ship to return into <HI>Europe,</HI>
I prayed the Governour to give me &s;ome
Men to conduct me up the River which
they call <HI>Sildem,</HI> to enter higher into
the Countrey to make &s;ome di&s;coveries.
The Governour a&s;&s;ured me that he had
had the &s;ame curio&s;ity formerly him&s;elf,
but that he was diverted from it by the
certain information he had that the In|habitants
of the Countrey were &s;uch
Salvages, that they &s;pared no per&s;on;
and he added, that about three months
before they entrapped two Souldiers,
and that he had heard by a Salvage, that
they had tied them by the Feet, and
hanged them in Trees at five or &s;ix
paces di&s;tance, then knocked them one
again&s;t the other, that by hurting and
beating one again&s;t another, they might
be brui&s;ed to death; and that round
about them there was a great number of
Children who expected when the blood
and brains of tho&s;e mi&s;erable people
&s;hould fall to the ground, on purpo&s;e to
gather them up, and eat them. And that
the&s;e barbarous people having &s;een them
<PB N="182" REF="94">
render up their la&s;t ga&s;p in the&s;e cruel
Torments, had taken down their brui&s;ed
Bodies beaten all black, and devoured
them without any other dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The&s;e cruelties hindred me from de|&s;iring
to know more particularly either
the Countrey or the Inhabitants. I
began then to be extreamly troubled,
when there arrived at the Port a French
Ve&s;&s;el, which brought a kind of a
Chaloop along with him, which they
had &s;eized upon in a Ferry-place as it
was pa&s;&s;ing into an I&s;land of the Sou|thern
Countrey. There was no body
on Board but a <HI>Venerable old man</HI> ac|compained
with the &s;ix Rowers which
&s;erved him in the room of Valetts.
This man looked very much like an
<HI>Au&s;tralian;</HI> his Forehead and Chin
were &s;quarer than they were long, his
Hair and all his Beard black, and
his Body of a brown Colour. As &s;oon
as I &s;aw him I was touched with com|pa&s;&s;ion
for him, and had an extream de|&s;ire
to know who he was. The Go|vernour
made no difficulty to give me
leave to &s;ee him, being de&s;irous that I
&s;hould draw out by his means &s;ome
knowledge of the Countrey, which yet
he hardly believed could be done. I
<PB N="183" REF="94">
came then to the old man, and having
te&s;tified to him by many &s;igns that I was
in the &s;ame Captivity with him&s;elf, he
began to &s;hew &s;ome &s;igns of comfort.
After three or four Enterviews, I found
a way to make my mind known to him
after this manner. We agreed by &s;igns
to frame certain words to explain our
thoughts. I formed two hundred in
one night which he comprehended ea&s;i|ly;
Having formed in two months time
a kind of Language &s;ufficiently capable
to make us under&s;tand one another.
I told him all my Hi&s;tory, my Ship|wracks,
my Arrival in <HI>Au&s;tralia,</HI> the
&s;tay I had made there, and the manner
of my e&s;cape. Having engaged him
by all this freedom and openne&s;s to
put confidence in me; he made no
difficulty to di&s;cover &s;everal con&s;ider|able
circum&s;tances of his Countrey to
me. He told me that he lived in the
middle of an I&s;land, that the Climate
was very Healthful, the Land very
Fertile, and the People well Accom|pli&s;hed.
That they had two &s;trong Bar|ricadoes
that &s;eparated them on the Ea&s;t
and We&s;t from two barbarous People;
to wit, two prodigious Mountains;
that of the Ea&s;t was called <HI>Harnor,</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="95">
that of the We&s;t <HI>Canor:</HI> And that
on the Sea-&s;ide, Nature had walled
them in with &s;uch banks of Sand, that
they could not get over them without
the experience of many years, he added
that their Countrey was about &s;ix thou&s;and
Miles about, that the Government was
Ari&s;tocratical, and that they cho&s;e eve|ry
three years &s;ix Governours; the fir&s;t
for the North-Sea, the &s;econd for the
South-Sea, the third for Mount <HI>Harnor,</HI>
the fourth for Mount <HI>Canor,</HI> and two
others for the re&s;t of the Countrey;
that the&s;e Governours had power of
Life and Death over all People within
their di&s;trict of what condition &s;oever
they were. For the re&s;t, that they
cultivated the Earth, and &s;owed and
reaped as they did in <HI>Europe;</HI> that the
bea&s;ts which &s;erved them for Labour
were of the bigne&s;s of Elephants. That
in General the People of this Countrey
loved their Liberties more than their
Lives, that he was one of the Gover|nours
of which he had told me, who&s;e
unhappy lo&s;s was cau&s;ed by a Tempe&s;t
that ro&s;e again&s;t all appearance as he
was going to vi&s;it &s;ome banks of Sand
which encrea&s;ed extraordinarily, that
the Tempe&s;t having carried him a great
<PB N="185" REF="95">
way off he fell into the hands of Pirates,
who delivered him to the Governour
of <HI>Tombolo.</HI></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed whole days in this agree|able
conver&s;ation, when there arrived
two Ships from the <HI>Mogul</HI> that were to
depart in a few days for <HI>Leghorn.</HI> I was
a little troubled to be deprived of the
conver&s;ation of a man &s;o agreeable and
rea&s;onable, neverthele&s;s not being wil|ling
to lo&s;e &s;o fair an occa&s;ion, I told
him that I was re&s;olved to take this
opportunity to return into my own
Countrey.</P>
<P>This news did &s;en&s;ibly afflict him, yet
he declared that my de&s;ign was too rea|&s;onable
to be oppo&s;ed, and &s;ome days
after going to take my leave of him,
he an&s;wered me coldly, that he &s;hould
leave me fir&s;t, and prayed me that I
would pre&s;erve that Friend&s;hip for him
in my heart, of which I had given
him &s;o many te&s;timonies of &s;ince our ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>A little while after, he ca&s;t him&s;elf at
my feet, to &s;ignifie the e&s;teem which he
had for me, and having cryed out five or
&s;ix times in his Language, two of his
Valletts ran to him and &s;trangled him;
and afterwards ran with their heads &s;o
<PB N="186" REF="96">
forcibly one again&s;t the other, that they
beat out their brains and both fell dead
upon the place.</P>
<P>The four others, though they were
at a di&s;tance, did the &s;ame in a moment,
&s;o that they were all found dead toge|ther,
which extreamly &s;urprized the
Governour and all that were with him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the contents of <HI>Sadeurs
Memoirs</HI> written with his own hand.
<HI>His Hi&s;tory ends here,</HI> and in all appear|ance
being Embarqued pre&s;ently after
the Death of the old man of which we
have &s;poken, he had no lei&s;ure to write
the <HI>Adventures</HI> of his return in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
