<HEAD>A dangerous &s;ea-fight neer the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t, on Friday la&s;t between the Eng|li&s;h and the Dutch; with the particulars thereof, and the manner of the engage|ment &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THis morning we received adverti&s;ements, of a great engagement (ye&s;terday) neer the Ea&s;tern Channel, between the Eng|li&s;h and Dutch; the manner thus: The States &s;hips that were in this Harbour, having b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">en &s;upplied with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries which they wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ted, on the 23 in&s;tant, put forth to &s;ea; but they had not long rode upon the Neptune Ocean; but they made a di&s;covery of about eleven &s;ail of Flemmins, who
<PB N="4" REF="3">had Letters of Mart from the States of Holland, to &s;ight any &s;hips what&s;oever, belonging to the Re|publique of England, and to make prize and enjoy all whom they could take, which Pyratical Act, pro|duced them the Name of Free-booters; but indeed this Title was at la&s;t dear-bought; for, the Engli&s;h with a pro&s;perous gale, bearing clo&s;e up to them, gave them &s;uch a Volley, that it made even the wind and waves &s;eem to conte&s;t for Victory; yet the Fle|mins perceiving that they were odds &s;ufficient, be|ing eleven to two, cho&s;e rather to embrace an hono|rable di&s;pute, then to yield upon ignoble and un|worthy terms; and truly, to deal plainly, and im|partially, give the Devil his due, they fought very gallantly, till at la&s;t, our undanted Engli&s;h Hectors, &s;eeing nothing would daunt them, and perceiving the Victory &s;omewhat dubious, re&s;olved to fight it out either to Death or Conque&s;t; and thereupon mutually re&s;olved to live and die together; in or|der whereunto, &s;o clo&s;e and thick did they ply the enemy with Key-&s;hot, long Chains, and Bolts of I|ron, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> divers of the Dutch were inforced to make the Sea their Tomb; Others, were made lower by the head, by the matchle&s;s force of Powder, and links of Iron; &s;ome had their arms and legs &s;hot off; A|mong&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="3">the re&s;t, their Captain General Myn Heer Galen (&s;on to Admiral Van-Galen in the Streights) is lamentably di&s;membred; for, as he adventured him&s;elf in the greate&s;t heat of action, &s;o did he &s;u|&s;tain the greate&s;t &s;hare and &s;orrow in affliction, in|&s;omuch, that mo&s;t of his wounds are conceived to be mortal. He lo&s;s will be much lamented; for 'tis &s;aid he was a man of &s;ingular knowledge and judgment in Martial Affairs, and the Art of Naviga|tion; yet many of his own men condemn him for that Heathen-like expre&s;&s;ion, made u&s;e of and &s;e|conded by Admiral De-witte, as he was engaging lately again&s;t the Engli&s;h, I (&s;aid he) will lead on the fleet again&s;t the Engli&s;h, let the Devil bring them off again.</P>
<P>Now whether it was an Engli&s;h or Dutch Devil I know not: I have better thoughts, and hope Al|mighty God, who hath delivered us in all our &s;traits and extremities, will now give us a good i&s;|&s;ue of this War, and add further links of his Mercy to tho&s;e who de&s;ire to extoll and glorifie his name; for indeed even in this appears his loving kindne&s;s, who was plea&s;ed to crown the heads of his &s;ervants, with triumphant and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s, by van|qui&s;hing the proud enemy, and taking about 300
<PB N="6" REF="4">pri&s;oners, and 4 &s;hips, with little lo&s;s. The re&s;t got off, being much rent and torn; but we hear &s;ince that two of them are &s;unk.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOthing but fire and &s;word will &s;erve to allay the burning Choler of the Princely party, who are grown to &s;uch an extreme height of arrogancy, That down with your Parliament now they cry, and &s;ay this is the time to &s;et their poor di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter in his Royal Saddle, and re&s;tore him to his di&s;-joynted Throne. But alas, it is not their high Rants, nor their quaffing of full bowls, that can bring to pa&s;s &s;uch mighty Revolutions, though
<PB N="7" REF="4">they give out, that all Emperours, Kings, and Princes in Europe, will be in&s;trumen|tal for his Re&s;tauration; but indeed by the Eye of Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t conclude this to be incredible, if we &s;eriou&s;ly weigh and con|&s;ider the &s;everal I inks of his infinite mercy, towards your Parliament and Army, and how he hath &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted his own will and plea&s;ure, with that loud Declarati|on from Heaven, &s;o mightily &s;et forth in the late &s;udden Revolutions and Actions, before, and at Worce&s;ter; whereby he un|que&s;tionably appeares to have given a full and final Deci&s;ion of the Controver&s;ie, and &s;eemes as it were with his own finger, to poiut out to all the World his Re&s;oluti|ons for England.</P>
<P>The Hollander &s;ollicits the French King, for a conjunction between France and the United Provinces, of which endeavors the
<PB N="8" REF="5">i&s;&s;ue is like to be fruitle&s;s. Yet that which bears up their drooping &s;pirits, is, the with|drawing the Spani&s;h forces out of France, the leaving of the Prince of Conde onely upon a po&s;ture of defence with ten thou|&s;and, and the advance of Gen Thuren with the Kings Army again&s;t him with eighteen thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot.</P>
<P>By which means, the Princely party re|tain &s;ome hopes of the advancing of their intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The great fleet from Newca&s;tle is now da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ly ex|pected with Coles; &s;ome are come up as far as Har|widge and Ip&s;wich, and care is taken to abate the in|tollerable and high price.
