<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t to you from hence, told you of the in|&s;olent carriage of the Cavaliers, and divers French De&s;pera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oes; which is no whit abated: For lately, as two of your Emba&s;&s;adours Gentlemen were going home in the Evening, they hapned to light upon three Frenchmen, who taking occa&s;ion to ju&s;tle them, without &s;peaking drew forth their Pi|&s;tols and fired, but God be thanked they mi&s;t them; whereupon my Lords Gentlemen drew, and then there aro&s;e a great tumult in the &s;treet, and the peo|ple having &s;eparated them, demanded their cau&s;e of quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">el, whereupon the French to ju&s;tifie their own
<PB N="2" REF="3"> actions, laid the blame upon the Emba&s;&s;adours Gen|tlemen, and &s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s was hu&s;ht up. Young <HI>Dori&s;laus</HI> and a cou&s;in of my Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> likewi&s;e named <HI>Fairfax,</HI> are threatned above all others. There are &s;everal <HI>Scotchmen</HI> likewi&s;e, that have taken a diveli&s;h Oath, prote&s;ting the death of my Lord St. <HI>John;</HI> [threaten'd folk live long] but no doubt, the wi&s;dom of this State will take order to curb and quiet the&s;e ranting humours. Many <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cavaliers come daily ru&s;hing into Town, as if &s;ome De&s;ign were a brewing. And they report up and down here, that <HI>Cromwel</HI> is dead, and that <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> hath routed and kild two thou&s;and of his men, and an hundred &s;uch incredible &s;tories, wherein the Roya|li&s;ts abound, even to the making of them&s;elves ridi|culous. Yet this doth effect &s;o much, that it often puts our cautious State&s;men to a &s;tand, and makes &s;ome &s;tagger, till they are certified by the next week or the next fortnights Po&s;t of the contrary; and then (perhaps) the Cavaliers have &s;ome other new &s;tory on foot, which takes off their re&s;olutions for ano|ther fortnight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour hath given them a neat &s;lip, and left good &s;tore of debts behinde him. Many of the Engli&s;h Cavalry are bound for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where (they &s;ay) their King is gotten to be Ma&s;ter, and that all Lads what&s;oever are admitted into his Ar|my; and many of them lye ready at <HI>Roterdam</HI> for a Winde to tran&s;port them thither. I much wondred a long time, why the Blades made &s;uch enquiry up and down, if all were quiet in England, it &s;eems they had a plot in conception which proved abortive.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P> <HI>Sir,</HI> I have likewi&s;e &s;ent you a repre&s;entation of our daily proceedings, which are as followeth:</P>
<P>The la&s;t of March, <HI>&s;tylo novo,</HI> a Fa&s;t was kept at my Lord Emba&s;&s;adours, to implore a ble&s;&s;ing upon our pre&s;ent proceedings; Mr. <HI>Dingley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> exerci&s;ed &s;everally, and at &s;upper we fell into an Engli&s;h mode of dyet, with great con|tentment and abundance; for then my Lords began the world upon their own accompt.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> &s;ome of the Gentlemen went with my Lord St. <HI>John</HI> to the new Hou&s;e, who was not very well for want of ayr; for the old Hou&s;e, was little and clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, being the Lords day, we had two &s;er|mons, the one preached by Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> the other by Mr. <HI>Ding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ey;</HI> and that morning information came to my Lords, de&s;iring Mr. <HI>Dori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">aus</HI> to have a care of him&s;elf; for there were &s;ome threatned his life.</P>
<P>The third in the morning, my Lords, and mo&s;t of the Gentlemen, &s;ome on hor&s;e-back, the re&s;t in coa|ches, went into the Wood &s;et with many fine walks and trees, to take the air; and as they entered, they met Prince <HI>Edward</HI> (one of the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ohemia's</HI> &s;ons) walking on foot, with the Prince&s;s his &s;i&s;ter, by the hand. He cald to my Lords Coach, and told them they were rogues, and grinded his teeth at the re&s;t, calling them dogs. But my Lord St. <HI>John's</HI> Groom following on hor&s;e-back, leading my Lords &s;addle-hor&s;e in his hand, the Prince &s;trook him on the back parts with his hat, but the hor&s;e flinging up his heels had like to have laid his honour at his feet. My Lord rode about the Wood, and returned to dinner.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P> After dinner he went abroad again, to take the ayr at <HI>Scheveling,</HI> and was much plea&s;ed with the place, it lying a mile from the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon the Sea|&s;hore. We returned about five or &s;ix a clock.</P>
<P>The fourth, &s;ixe of the States who were appoint|ed Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with their Lord&s;hips, <HI>(viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cemeren, Ereren Eoon, De Vett, Rein&s;wood, Andree,</HI> and <HI>Valfs,)</HI> came this day the fir&s;t time. My Lords received them at the door, and the Gentle|men went up &s;tairs, and made a Lane for them to pa&s;s through: they &s;taid about half an hour with my Lords, gave them &s;ome complements, and re|ceived &s;ome propo&s;itions, which they carried away with them.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Emba&s;&s;adours complained to &s;ome of the States, of the ill language which Prince <HI>Ed|ward</HI> gave them ye&s;terday; whereupon it was Or|dered, that three of them &s;hould go to the queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to let her know how ill they re&s;ented the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to know of her, whether they were not Ma&s;ters of their own Country? And to enquire how the Prince dur&s;t break any order they had made? And withall, to certifie her, that he &s;hould &s;everely &s;uffer for his contempt: This Me&s;&s;age be|ing delivered to the <HI>Queen,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of her &s;on <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ward,</HI> he would willingly have excu&s;ed the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and &s;aid; that &s;ome of the Emba&s;&s;adours fol|lowers gave him (as he was walking with a Lady) the fir&s;t affront, which was the occa&s;ion that he re|turned them that uncivil language.</P>
<P>It is reported, that the &s;aid Prince is going towards <HI>Franckendale,</HI> for the Letters that came this Week
<PB N="5" REF="4"> from <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rmany</HI> inform us, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath &s;ent an expre&s;s, for the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ranckenda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> to the Prince Elector. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the States are re&s;olved [be|fore he departeth] to bring him before a Court of <HI>J&V;STICE,</HI> to teach him to keep a better tongue in his head another time; and we expect to have him &s;everely dealt withal. The <HI>Queens</HI> Court is grown very mute about this bu&s;ine&s;s, and Prince <HI>Edward</HI> is much &s;tartled at it.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>April,</HI> the Lords Emba&s;&s;adours get up by &s;even a clock in the morning, and rode on hor&s;e-back with &s;ome of their Gentlemen, to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden,</HI> where having rode through the Town, and viewed the Academy and other ra|rities, returned about midday.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the <HI>Prince&s;s Royal</HI> came by my Lord Emba&s;&s;adours hou&s;e, in a Coach with &s;ix hor|&s;es, all in mourning, and two more coaches (in the &s;ame equipage) attending her; it &s;eems &s;he is not gone with the Duke her brother, as was reported: certain it is, &s;he did re&s;olve to go, but upon encou|ragements frome &s;ome, &s;he &s;taid. It is to bee feared, that though her husband be dead, too many of his creatures are alive: yet doubtle&s;s, the States &s;ee &s;o much of their own intere&s;t in ours, that we &s;hall re|ceive a quick and cordial di&s;patch. Though I hear, that there came once hither a French Emba&s;&s;adour, about bu&s;ine&s;s of a far le&s;s import, which he thought to have di&s;patched in a moneths time, but was fain to &s;tay thirteen, before he could make an end of it. But (we hope) their goodne&s;s (perhaps) our own di&s;cretion, will not permit us to do &s;o.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P> The States about three a clock this afternoon, &s;ent the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to treat with our Em|ba&s;&s;adours, who were entertained by their Lord&s;hips with much re&s;pect; who delivered certain pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rs from the States directed to their Lord&s;hips, wherein they propo&s;e; Fir&s;t, that the old Corre&s;pondencies and Amity between the two States may be pre&s;erved and renewed; Secondly, that they may enter into a more &s;trict <HI>Confederacy;</HI> And la&s;tly, that one &s;hould be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting unto another, again&s;t all per|&s;ons what&s;oever that &s;hould di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>The States have referred Prince <HI>Edwards</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s to be determined &s;peedily in a Court of Ju&s;tice; and without que&s;tion it concerns them to &s;ee us have Ju|&s;tice in this particular; For it was <HI>England</HI> received the affront done by that petty Prince, who&s;e Nur|&s;ing was paid for out of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exchequer: And therefore we are confident tho&s;e in power here a|mong the <HI>Dutch,</HI> cannot but con&s;ult &s;o far with their own honors, as to make a the Vindication, an&s;werable to the crime. The young P. of <HI>Orange</HI> hath been much troubled with convul&s;ion fits, in&s;omuch that it was commonly reported he departed in one of tho&s;e fits; but &s;ince he is recovered, and is now in health.</P>
<P>There is daily expected here, an Emba&s;&s;adour from the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e entertainment we de|&s;ire to take a view of, for thereby we may gue&s;s whether they are really affected to the Common|wealth of England or not. Take this from the hand of</P>
