<HEAD>The Coppy of a Letter writ|ten to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> con|cerning the match with <HI>Spaine.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THough to advi&s;e may &s;eeme pre&s;umptuous, what is well intended I am more then confident will not be either offen&s;ive to your Lord&s;hip, or prejudiciall to me; the rather what is now offered is, not for your good onely, but for the generall al&s;o; the honour whereof as in &s;ome &s;ort you may appropria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;o you cannot but participate and commu|nicate in the benefit.</P>
<P>The Parable in the Go&s;pell tells us of a great King that married his Sonne and bid many thereto, yea upon the excu&s;es of &s;ome and refu|&s;all of others, all of what &s;ort &s;oever and condition as well out of the high-waies as high places, were called and invited. As every true Chri&s;tian hath an intere&s;t in the Marriage of the Kings Son of Hea|ven; &s;o every good Subject as well as every great &s;ubject hath an in|terre&s;t in the marriage and welfare of the Kings Sonne here on Earth, which occa&s;ions &s;o many to wi&s;h, that it may bring to him glory in her, good will and peace to him on earth, which is much doubted can|not be from <HI>Spaine,</HI> &s;ince the motion of this match makes a gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> feare t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">at it can neither be &s;afe for the Kings per&s;on not good for this Church and Common-wealth, becau&s;e that thereby may be an in-let to the Romi&s;h Locu&s;ts, who like a Canker-worme may in an in&s;tant &s;mite our Gourd under who&s;e &s;hadow wee &s;it &s;afe; and then what
<PB N="3" REF="2"> may we all feare but the heate of per&s;ecution, or di&s;&s;ention to beate upon the head of <HI>Ionah</HI> the be&s;t affected of Gods people.</P>
<P>Who can but lament and wi&s;h with <HI>Jonah</HI> to dye, rather than to &s;ee and endure that day; for what evill will they not attempt again&s;t our goodly Cedar tree, that the Vine which their left hand hath planted may grow up? and they be &s;heltred under her Branches. But herein it is hoped that God will enable this State &s;ooner to make prevention of their mi&s;chiefe than triall of their affections, for as there is no per&s;on that wounded them more deepely, &s;o there is no per&s;on whom they hate more deadly. And if they murthered the la&s;t Lord, <HI>Hen.</HI> of <HI>France</HI> becau&s;e they but &s;u&s;pected him to favour the Prote&s;tants how doe they burne in malice again&s;t him who hath &s;o profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe, and blazed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> glory and their &s;hame? And it is as un&s;afe for men as di&s;plea&s;ing to God, to relye upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> of Bullen King of Navar father of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4. drawne by an imaginary Crowne of Sardinia and the Provinces of the Spaniard, left the Prote&s;tants both in profe&s;&s;ion and per&s;on, and became a per&s;e|cutor of tho&s;e who&s;e protector he was; but whiles he ca&s;t his hopes upon Spaine he was deprived of his owne Crowne, and God in Ju&s;tice who never leaves any that leane vpon him, fir&s;t gave him o|ver to a violent death, for a bullet tooke him within his owne Tren|ches be&s;ieging the poore Prote&s;tants in Roane; <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth his Sonne, what Battells did he fight, what dangers did he e&s;cape even to admiration while he was at di&s;tance with the Pope and Spaniards? but when in a politick and worldly re&s;pect hee ta&s;ted the &s;ame &s;ower Grape which &s;et his fathers teeth on edge; Fir&s;t a young Ie&s;uite &s;trook him on the mouth, and then a Popi&s;h Raviliack &s;tab'd him to the heart. Whereas Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the happie&s;t in&s;trument of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s glory of her &s;ex, &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, notwith&s;tanding the few friends &s;he had abroad and divi&s;ion at home when &s;hee came to the Crowne, being a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ane woman yet &s;he refu&s;ed the King of Spaine, being her fir&s;t and earne&s;t Sutor by the Earle of Feria his Amba&s;&s;a|dour and notwith&s;tanding the thundering of the Popes Bulls and Spani&s;h Canons openly, or the working of his Pi&s;tols privately, they were never able to cut as much as the lap of her coate, or to dimini&s;h one haire, much le&s;&s;e the Crowne off her head. And His Maje&s;ty, that now is continuing con&s;tant in the &s;ame Religion &s;he profe&s;&s;ed, continueth no le&s;&s;e miraculou&s;ly in Gods protection; and though
<PB N="4" REF="3"> there were but one Prote&s;tant Prince in Chri&s;tendome then be&s;ides him&s;elfe, cho&s;e rather to match with her, than with all the wealth of Spaine, or any other popi&s;h Prince.</P>
<P>What therefore his Maje&s;ty hath given by precept to the Prince in his Booke, and by precedency in his owne per&s;on will undoubtedly be expected, and all good men hope will be performed; for as the Prince Proclaimes the King his Father by his wonderfull likene&s;&s;e and re&s;emblance of the King him &s;elfe, &s;o it is hoped he will never ap|peare unlike him as in his other vertues, &s;o particularly in the choi&s;e of his &s;econd &s;elf, which &s;o meerely concernes him&s;elf and your Lord&s;hip onely, for none can be too circum&s;pect, e&s;pecially &s;ince not a Somer|&s;et, not a Secretary onely, but the fir&s;t, the &s;tronge&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t man that ever was, though they were all good men, and Types of Chri&s;t, yet they were hereby tempted and &s;educed.</P>
<P><HI>To addre&s;&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e more particularly to your Lord&s;hip, Kings have almo&s;t ever had their favourites.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> had long &s;ince his <HI>Hephae&s;tion.</HI> and <HI>H.</HI> 3. of France his <HI>Epermon,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> of Spaine had &s;ince his <HI>Larvea,</HI> yea the be&s;t Princes have not wanted them; for after the reckoning of <HI>Davids</HI> great Officers, <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> the Archite is called the Kings friend, <HI>Ira</HI> the <HI>Iairite</HI> is &s;et downe to have been chiefe about <HI>David,</HI> which &s;tands with rea&s;on, and agreeth with nature; for every private man is left to affect as he liketh: neither can affection be forced. Now to di&s;-allow or confine that in a King which is left at liberty to the meane&s;t &s;ub|ject, were prepo&s;terous and injurious. For though they Command actions as they are Kings, yet are they &s;ubject to their pa&s;&s;ion as they are men.</P>
<P>And if I may alleadge it without mi&s;-interpretation of others (as I am free from ill meaning my &s;elfe) who knowes but Chri&s;t, the rather to &s;hew him&s;elfe a Naturall man, expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much the more his Pa&s;&s;ion in his often weeping and affection to diver&s;e particulars, but e&s;pecially to Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> (if I may not &s;ay his favourite) certaintly the Di&s;ciple whom Ie&s;us loved more than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is Gods ble&s;&s;ing and your happine&s;&s;e to be the Kings Favourite, as <HI>Peter</HI> therefore not pre&s;uming to aske Chri&s;t of whom hee &s;pake, beckned to the Di&s;ciple whom Ie&s;us loved, on who&s;e brea&s;t he leaned to aske for him: &s;o &s;ure mo&s;t men neither may nor ought to be &s;o bold to aske or advi&s;e the King in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;o much &s;poken of,
<PB N="5" REF="3"> yet they point at you, who the higher you are in the Kings favour, the more you are in the peoples eye and ob&s;ervation; and they expect you will not be wanting in the duty of a &s;ubject, a Coun&s;ellour and a Favourite; but as the rea&s;ons and per&s;wa&s;ions are known to have the better opportunity to be delivered, and the more credit to be believed, &s;o in this ca&s;e to be with the King as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> one of Gods greate&s;t Fa|vourites and familiar &s;ervants to &s;tand in the gap, to divert the plague (for &s;o in mo&s;t mens judgements it is feared) how glorious and ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;oever it &s;eeme outwardly, I am confident you thinke the Kings favour and your owne fortunes are not for your owne ends a|lone, or for any ill end at all, wee have lately &s;eene the ends of tho&s;e that have propo&s;ed &s;uch ends, and as Gods providence extends to the fall of a Sparrow, &s;o much more to the ri&s;e of a Favourite. And who knowes but the &s;ame, that rai&s;ed <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> in Aegypt, hath advanced you in England for the like end.</P>
<P>To parallel you in no di&s;paragement you are a younger Brother by a &s;econd marriage as <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> was, a faire per&s;on and well favoured as <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> was, the King hath for your honour altered your name, as <HI>Io&s;ephs</HI> was, you have honoured and inriched your Parents and bre|thren, and kindred as <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> did, <HI>Io&s;ephs</HI> kindred were made known to <HI>Pharoah</HI> as yours to our <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> Now my Lord &s;eeing you follow <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> &s;o farre leave him not to the end, but &s;trive to be a meanes to pre&s;erve this our Land from a &s;pirituall famine. We read not of any &s;ervant better re&s;pected of his Ma&s;ter than <HI>Eliazar</HI> of Dama&s;cus, whom <HI>Abraham</HI> had meant (had he dyed childle&s;&s;e) to have made his heire, and we find not any &s;ervice he did <HI>Abraham</HI> more (at lea&s;t greater) then in the choi&s;e of a wife for his &s;onne <HI>I&s;aac.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;ervants of our Patriarch, <HI>The Defender of the Faith,</HI> we ob&s;erve none better re&s;pected than your &s;elfe, and we know not in what you may doe him better &s;ervice then with <HI>Eliazar</HI> to helpe to choo&s;e a <HI>Rebecca</HI> for our <HI>I&s;aack, Abrahams</HI> injunction is a good direction not to take her among&s;t the Cananite Princes, for having liberty to ta&s;te of every tree in the Garden, if wee &s;hall one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y meddle with the forbidden fruit how mi&s;erable and woefull is our condition; for the Serpent will not onely beguile the woman but the Phili&s;tims will intreat Dalilah, &amp; &s;he will betray <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> &s;o while they plough with our Heyfer they will unfold our Riddle and undoe our State.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what&s;oever Language the Father &s;peakes the children doe
<PB N="6" REF="4"> commonly &s;peake the mother tongue, and where&s;oever there is a <HI>Ba|bel,</HI> there is a confu&s;ion not of tongues onely, but of &s;tates.</P>
<P>Whereas Chri&s;ts Church is like his Coate clo&s;ely woven and at peace within it &s;elfe, though &s;ome itching Seperati&s;ts &s;eeke to make a hole in our coate and Church, which the Papi&s;ts labour to rent wor&s;e, and the de&s;perate Ie&s;uit makes it pa&s;t mending for where&s;oever they come they turne Chri&s;ts coate into <HI>Deiantar</HI> garment, which as it &s;et <HI>Hercules</HI> on fire, &s;o it &s;et others in combu&s;tion; the rea&s;on is, their fir&s;t founder was a Souldier, and ever &s;ince, <HI>The way of peace they have not knowne;</HI> at lea&s;t not lov'd. To in&s;tance in particular not un|fit for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, we have not heard of any Prote&s;tant King that ever married with a contrary Religion, who&s;e raigne hath bin pro&s;perous but very fatall and unfortunate.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> of Navar married with <HI>Mary</HI> of France, which marriage was very unfortunate to the parties never having i&s;&s;ue, and being af|terwards divorced, and &s;o fatall to our Religion that there was more bloud &s;pilt at tho&s;e Nuptialls than wine &s;pent; for whil&s;t the Parents dreamed of the glory and &s;ecurity they &s;hould have by the match, they were mo&s;t mi&s;erably ma&s;&s;acred, and who doubts but what the French committed in their owne Country, upon that colour would any Papi&s;ts be glad to doe in this Kingdome, for without breach of charity we may doubt of their &s;incere meaning when they &s;eeme to de&s;ire the greate&s;t union; for in 88. while there was a Treaty of peace, the Spani&s;h Armado came upon us. If therefore we either live or are led by example or precept, we &s;hall finde it was forbidden the people of the world to marry with a different Religion; the injuncti|on; the rea&s;on and the effect are &s;et downe in Deutrinomy to the Iewes. And we &s;ee in <HI>Salomon</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t King that ever was, who married one of the greate&s;t Kings daughters that then was, yet we &s;ee the weake&s;t &s;ex withdrew the wi&s;e&s;t man, for <HI>Salomon</HI> became an Idolater, his Son a foole, his Subjects rebelled, and the be&s;t part of his Kingdome rent from his po&s;terity for ever.</P>
<P>If we &s;earch our Chronicles we &s;hall finde that God hath cro&s;t (if not cur&s;t) our alliance and a&s;&s;ociation with forraigne Princes, e&s;pe|cially with Spaine. A Prince of the greate&s;t performance that this Kingdome or Chri&s;tendome ever had was the black Prince, yet go|ing into Spaine to &s;ettle <HI>Don Pedro</HI> in that Kingdome, be&s;ides the mon&s;trous ingratitude and perfidiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Spaniard, who fai|led
<PB N="7" REF="4"> of the performance of tho&s;e conditions hee had promi&s;ed, which cau&s;ed the un&s;eperable Revolt in France to the lo&s;&s;e of our inheri|tance, the Prince was poy&s;oned in that Country that hee never had his health afterwards.</P>
<P>But to come neerer to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e and to our owne times, which are little the better for our Spani&s;h friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip ob&s;erve that all the marriages for this la&s;t 120. yeares (except the &s;everall &s;econd marriages of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. have bin onely and no where el&s;e but with Spaine, with how little good God hath ble&s;&s;ed them, the &s;ucce&s;&s;e &s;hewes.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> married the Spani&s;h Kings daughter, wee know God tooke him away pre&s;ently by a &s;udden death without any i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>In a politicke re&s;pect wee would then make a &s;econd match for Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> afterwards King, did marry the &s;ame daughter, but doubtle&s;&s;e God was le&s;&s;e plea&s;ed with that match which was le&s;&s;e lawfull, and God tooke away all the male children, and left onely a daughter, in who&s;e &s;hort reigne was &s;hed more bloud for the true Re|ligion in &s;ixe yeares, than for the fal&s;e in the&s;e &s;ucceeding &s;ixty yeares. We made then a third adventure and married with Spaine, Queene <HI>Mary</HI> with King <HI>Philip,</HI> which was &s;o di&s;contenting to the people, that it cau&s;ed <HI>Wiats</HI> Rebellion, &s;o di&s;comfortable that it broke the Queenes heart being left and neglected by her husband &s;o di&s;honou|rable and prejudiciall to this Kingdome, that meerely for the Spani|ards &s;ake we having no difference with France we lo&s;t Callis in &s;ixe dayes which had bin above 200. yeares in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And though I have not &s;o much judgement, nor &s;o little wit to pre&s;ume where to match, yet I a&s;&s;ume &s;o much as to think a match at home cannot be held any waies inconvenient.</P>
<P>Wee find that the fir&s;t and the la&s;t of our Kings that ever matcht with their &s;ubjects were <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to which three matches God as it were to &s;hew the le&s;&s;e we relye upon others abroad, the more hee will ble&s;&s;e us him&s;elfe at home; for by the two latter marriages God gave two daughters, two <HI>Elizabeths,</HI> two &s;uch Queenes, than which there were never two &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed in&s;truments of Gods glory, and this Kingdomes good, by e&s;tabli&s;hing peace in the Land, and Religion in the Church, untill his Maje&s;ties mo&s;t happy comming who brought both with him.</P>
