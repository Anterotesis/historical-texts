<P>THe Royall party begins to declare very high for the declared King of Scots, again&s;t the pre&s;ent Au|thority of this Nation, and in&s;ulteth very much over the wellaffected party, &s;aying, That <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hall be King, and woe be unto them that &s;ayes again&s;t it; and upon Fri|day la&s;t &s;everall Gentlemen (extraordinary well mounted and gallantly armed) of quality came to Manche&s;ter, and there proclaimed Prince <HI>Charles</HI> (elde&s;t Son to <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t) King of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> which done, they departed the town without interruption or mole&s;tati|on; and from thence went to Wiggin, where they cau&s;ed
<PB N="2" REF="3">the like to be proclaimed as formerly; and from thence they went to Kendall in We&s;tmerland, where they met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition at the proclaiming thereof; the man|ner thus: A party of the Parliaments Souldiers having re|ceived information of their de&s;ign, prepared to receive them, and even in the nick of time came in upon them, di&s;|puted the place with &s;everall Vollies, and at la&s;t the Royall party &s;eeing them&s;elves overpowred in number, betooke them&s;elves to a retreat, and by the &s;wiftne&s;&s;e of their hor&s;es made an honourable retreat, and e&s;caped, with the lo&s;&s;e of two men.</P>
<P>One Col. Walton is &s;aid to be the Commander in chiefe of the Royall party, and leaves no means una&s;&s;ayed for the advancing of his young Ma&s;ters Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament of Scotland &s;eem to be exceedingly di&s;|contented at the tran&s;action of affairs in England, and at the pre&s;ent proceedings of their young King (as they &s;ay) and have &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the queen of Sweden, with a large Narative of what they did joyntly with the Parliament of England, where they fell off, how they dete&s;t their late pro|ceedings, in reference to the executing of their late Sove|raign Lord the King, how their young King is &s;educ'd by evill Councell, and from thence hath not given their Com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;atisfaction nece&s;&s;ary for his own and the King|domes Weal, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ie unto him, to per&s;wade him to a Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;peedy A|greement; <HI>but this &s;eems a my&s;tery to many, divers conceiving it to be one of</HI> Jockies <HI>new Riddles.</HI></P>
<P>For it is frequently &s;aid, that the Articles of Agreement are already concluded of, and that they begin to ca&s;t this Mi&s;t, only to ob&s;cure the eye-&s;ight of the Engli&s;h until they have brought to maturity their de&s;ign in hand, for the rai|&s;ing of 15000 Hor&s;e and Foot to joyn with the 5000 alrea|dy

<P>His Excellency Generall Le&s;ley being de&s;ired to deliver up the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of Edenburgh, returned an&s;wer, That he was re&s;olved to keepe it for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who had entru&s;ted him, meaning the late <HI>King of Great Brittain, Charles the first.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament are very private in their debates, and (&s;ay &s;ome) are re&s;olved to &s;hake the foundation of Here&s;ie.</P>
<P>Lievtenant Collonel Hob&s;on is come to Edenburgh, his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is variou&s;ly &s;poken, &s;ome whi&s;per that he de&s;ires pa&s;sage for &s;ome to go for Ireland, others to make way for &s;ome farther overture from Parl of England, what ever it is he is looked upon with a jealous eye.</P>
<P>From the I&s;le of Man our Intelligence &s;aith, That Sir <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> and many other Engli&s;h Gallants, have made great preparations in that I&s;land again&s;t the Parliament of England, and are re&s;olved for Ireland, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Marque&s;&s;e of Ormond, and &s;trengthen the &s;iege at Dublin; from whence it is &s;aid, that the Parliaments party is reduced to Dublin, Dredah, Dundale, Trim, and London-Derry, the fir&s;t &amp; la&s;t being be&s;ieged; by Ormonds coming up to Dublin he hath got the greate&s;t part of five Counties from Col. Jones, which afforded him many thou&s;and pounds contribution.</P>

<P>Sir, We hear that the Royall par|ty about Newark upon Trent hath lately proclaimed Prince <HI>Charles</HI> King of Great Brittain, France and Ireland, at the Marker place, and give out very high language again&s;t the pre&s;ent Authority of this Nation, &s;aying, that they will have a King, and that they neither can nor will lye any longer un|der the in&s;upportable burthen of curelty, tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion; but its hoped care will be taken for the allaying of the di&s;tempers of the&s;e troubled &s;pirits, &amp; &s;peedy cour&s;e taken for the preventing of the like for the future.</P>
<P>By Letters from the We&s;t it is &s;aid, that the adver&s;e party in Cornwall, have lately had a meeting neer Truro, where they declared their Re&s;olutions for the proclaiming of Pr. Charles King, and to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible meanes for his re&s;tau|ration; but its believed, that if they per&s;i&s;t on in this trea&s;o|nable de&s;ign, as the Parliament of England hath declared it, they will &s;uddenly receive a Corni&s;h hug.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e hear, that a Squadron of the Princes &s;hips hath fallen on the Northern Fleet, and that they have taken about 30 &s;hips laden with comodities for London, and di&s;|pier&s;ed the Convoy: this Victory (it's &s;aid) fell to Capt. Plunket (Rear Admirall to the Prince) who hath a gallant &s;hip carrying 50 pieces of Ordnance, called <HI>The Mirrour of Dunkirk,</HI> formerly the King of Spain's Vice-admirall.</P>
<P>The K. of Denmark hath cau&s;ed to be proclaimed through all his Dominions, <HI>That who&s;oever will take up Arms again&s;t the Parliament of England, they &s;hall have free egre&s;&s;e and re|gre&s;se into his Harbours, and may freely &s;ecure within his Do|minions any prize made vpon the Engli&s;h &s;hips, belonging to the Parliament.</HI></P>
