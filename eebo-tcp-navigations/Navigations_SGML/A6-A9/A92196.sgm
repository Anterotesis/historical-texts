<P>_DEdicatory leaves to a
Book, like a Curtaine
before a picture, only
beget &s;ome higher
expectation of the Piece; A
weather beaten Traveller needs
no &s;uch &V;mbrilla as a Patron to
&s;hroud under. Though this Booke
was not writ to bee Printed, yet
the wor&s;t (infallibly) are printed
to be read. My intention was to
confine this wanderer to my Clo|&s;et
and no farther; till the advice
of &s;ome familiar, and command
<PB REF="4">
of Superiour Friends pre&s;t mee to
exchange a &s;ingle Manu&s;cript
for more Numerous Prints. I can
challenge no other inducement
then that I expo&s;e &s;ome Novel|ties
which I que&s;tion not but this
age will di&s;ge&s;t. For the cutts
I have hither tran&s;ported, in|terpret
me not &s;o much de&s;irous
to grace the Page, as to pre&s;erve
Antiquity. My choyce con&s;i&s;ting

becau&s;e that particle (wee) im|plyes

Travellers, who can affirme what
I relate. Some (though &s;trange
yet no Contradiction) have &s;eene

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Returne your

brought them:
I have runne &s;wiftly over
<PB REF="8">
your <HI>Itinerary,</HI> but am not
&s;o impudent to pro|nounce

it; unle&s;&s;e I had more
time or a &s;teaddier Brain;
for after my riding
three dayes poa&s;t I am fit|ter
for &s;leep then Epi&s;tles.
The thing mo&s;t ob&s;erv|able
of all your Travells
is your &s;elfe, who are able
to gra&s;pe &s;o much of the
World, when 'tis not
twice ten yeares &s;ince you
came into it. I conceive
it flowes from your good
nature, thus to &s;et markes
on your &s;everall Stages,
that the Prints are vi&s;i|ble
<PB REF="8">
to your freinds and
Country: 'Twas u&s;efully
done, &s;ince now &s;o ma|ny
of us are doom'd to
wander, not like <HI>Cain</HI>
for drawing blood, but for
asking Peace. Did others
follow your example,
this <HI>unhabitable</HI>-VVorld
would have more Man|ners
and le&s;&s;e News. Many
<HI>Itineraries</HI> I have &s;eene in
Latine, few in Engli&s;h,
and tho&s;e &s;o partiall, that
Countries are de&s;crib'd
(as <HI>Committees</HI> do Gentle|men)
not as they are,
but as they would have
them. 'Tis a Noble Me|ditation
<PB REF="9">
how <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Italy</HI> (two great Cham|pions)
looke over the
Water, Daring and
threatning and watching
each other; 'twas once &s;o
'twixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI>
Such as have &s;een them

find <HI>London</HI> (like the

rendred other Parts poore

<HI>England</HI> is but one great

&s;ides do court and hate,

<P>_IT is preeminence

did then &s;way the
Allcoercive Scep|ter
on Earth, when our Redee|mer
a&s;&s;um'd the fle&s;h. To her
we owe our Civility; &s;hee pur|cha&s;t
it by conque&s;ts in the Le|vant;
Propogated it by Victo|ries
in the North, till di&s;pairing
of a Farther Plantation the
Picts wall was her <HI>Vltima Thule;</HI>
perhaps lea&s;t that people &s;hould
have &s;tumbled at the Innovati|on.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
To bee Retrograde on this
&s;ubject were to rob Hi&s;tory of
her birthright, to in&s;i&s;t on my
owne ocular ob&s;ervation but
veniall v&s;ury.</P>
<P>There are three evitable dan|gers
that divert &s;ome from this
Voyage; the fir&s;t is the heates
of the Climate; A &s;econd, that
horrible (in Report) Inqui&s;iti|on;
the la&s;t, Hazard of tho&s;e
mercile&s;&s;e Out Lawes <HI>Banditas.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t may bee allayd by
Moderation, the &s;econd preven|ted
by di&s;cretion; the la&s;t avoi|ded
by the defence of tho&s;e
&s;tates you pa&s;&s;e through.</P>
<P>This Duke of florence quite
extirpated that &s;avage Race
out of his Dominions by rai&s;ing
a competent number; that per|&s;onated
Robbers and joynd in
league with the reall ones till
they fouud opportunity to di&s;|patch
them.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
As there is connivance at the
<HI>Luterani</HI> (for &s;o they terme us)
&s;o tis ra&s;hne&s;&s;e to proclaime
ones opinion, weakene&s;&s;e to
di&s;clo&s;e it: This may gaine the
Odium of the Better, this the
injuries of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>A novice of late &s;o &s;oone as
he was come to <HI>Florence,</HI> &s;aid,
<HI>Methinks this place is &s;omewhat
popi&s;hly affected.</HI></P>
<P>Another with more pardo|nable
ignorance when his Ho&s;t
askt him whether he was walk|ing
in the Afternoone, replyd,
to Ma&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>One of my Cotemporaries
di&s;cour&s;ing with a Fryar, in a
Compleme~t prote&s;ted he did re|verence
Clergy men <HI>for that he
was the &s;onne of a Prie&s;t in Eng|land:</HI>
which the Monke could
not con&s;ter but either an <HI>Irony</HI>
to his Order, or Infamous to the
<PB REF="14">
Gentlemans owne de&s;cent.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t cautious tongue is
incident to the&s;e Errours; yet
that nation is not &s;o &s;crupulous
as to take notice of a &s;trangers
words or actions unle&s;&s;e openly
&s;candalous; for as <HI>Heretico</HI> is a
name utterly dete&s;table, &s;o
<HI>Tramontano</HI> by the Multitude is
held contemptible, which low
reputation begets a happy
privacy to the Re&s;erv'd For|reigner.</P>
<P>That &s;ort of People which
Travellers have mo&s;t agitation
with as <HI>Vetturino's</HI> Ho&s;ts &amp; the
like, are very peremptory and
cro&s;&s;e, which if you menace
they wil repaire with double in|&s;olence;
knowing that if in the
conte&s;t their <HI>Stilletto</HI> &s;hould do
mi&s;chiefe, the next Church may
be their A&s;ylum, where no Law
or violence can attempt them.</P>
<P><PB REF="14">
The &s;afe&s;t way is Di&s;&s;imula|tion,
and to winne better Ac|commodation
among&s;t them
di&s;parage not, rather commend
the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>Their <HI>O&s;terias</HI> or Innes &s;tand
u&s;ually alone, remote from any
Village, &s;o that Pa&s;&s;engers mu&s;t

nothing but an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Good words.</NOTE> <HI>Allegramente</HI>
for amends.</P>
<P>This Inference I lay hold on
to &s;peake more amply of the <HI>I|talian.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Rome</HI> wore the Impe|riall
Diadem of the &s;ubdued
World, it might have been a di|&s;putable
Critici&s;me, whither
<HI>Rome</HI> &s;tood in <HI>Italy;</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> in
<HI>Rome,</HI> That voice of fame
which attributed all to the <HI>Ro|man;</HI>
<PB REF="15">
derogated from the Re|nowne
of the <HI>Italian:</HI> Now,
&s;ince <HI>Rome</HI> did re&s;igne the
Crowne to the Miter; <HI>Italy</HI> al|lowes
her no Supremacy, but
Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall; and in the gene|rall
voge tis the mo&s;t proper
phra&s;e to &s;ay &s;uch a man is an
Italian, though a Native of
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>However, in the Survey of
this pre&s;ent Generation I finde a
re&s;idue of the old Genius &s;till
&s;urviving.</P>
<P>That Roman Genero&s;ity yet
runnes in the bloud of their No+ble
Families, which (I have
heard) can draw their Pedigree
from the great Ma&s;ters of the
World; as that of the <HI>Savelli</HI>
from <HI>Scipio Africanus.</HI></P>
<P>Neither doth the height of
their &s;pirits argue le&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Neopolitan</HI> is &s;o elevated
<PB REF="15">
with his imaginary Reven+newes that in his deepe&s;t po|verty
hee will &s;peake thou|&s;ands
rather then betray his
wants.</P>
<P>One will &s;it gravely before
his doore picking his teeth, and
condemne the Capon hee eate
la&s;t; when a mor&s;ell of Bread
would pa&s;&s;e downe merri|ly.</P>
<P>Another I have &s;een begging
in this method: fir&s;t he lookes
about to &s;ee whether the Coa&s;t
be cleare, before hee will utter
one &s;uppliant word; then hee
approaches in a more &s;ubmi&s;&s;e
&s;traine, yet if any one chance
to ca&s;t an eye that way; he re|treates
to familiarity; Pre&s;&s;ing
the ju&s;tne&s;&s;e of his Demands
till hee obtaines the almes;
which if but a penny or &s;o, hee
ca&s;ts it contemptibly in the Do|nours
<PB REF="16">
face, but &s;oone after
peaceably &s;earches for the mo|ney,
and when tis found prayes
for the Benefactour.</P>
<P>This is con&s;onant with the
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> &s;o is the <HI>Genue&s;ian</HI> as
lofty as his buildings, &s;o proud
in his Garbe, that at our fir&s;t
nights Supper in <HI>Genua,</HI> &s;ome
Fidlars came to welcome us
with their Mu&s;ick, but with &s;o
grave and &s;tately a Preamble,
that wee all withdrew from
our &s;eats to &s;alute the men, ima|gining
them no le&s;&s;e then Ma|gi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeians</HI> or Commo|nalty
of <HI>Italy</HI> &s;avour much of
the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls;</HI> yet e|ven
the&s;e are frequently di&s;tin|gui&s;ht
with the worthy Appel|lations
of <HI>Julio, Flaminio, Fa|bio,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Campagna di Roma</HI> I
<PB REF="16">
once e&s;pyde a Labourer tilling
the ground neer &s;ome decayed
Monuments; whereupon I
made towards the fellow and
askt him what tho&s;e Ruines
were; Hee an&s;wered mee, hee
knew nothing; but he had often
heard his Grandfather tell a
Story of one <HI>Signor Romolo,</HI>
that fought there. A twinck|ling
Tradition and implies
much.</P>
<P>They have a Recreation cer|tainly
deriv'd from their An|ce&s;tours,
<HI>viz: La Mora,</HI> anci|ently
<HI>micare Digitis,</HI> at the fir&s;t
it appeares but childi&s;hly ridi|culous;
after better acquain|tance,
a kinde of Conjuration;
Tis of force to binde the Fan|cy;
yet the mo&s;t illiterate are
be&s;t at the Game.</P>
<P>And no wonder &s;ince this
Ayre hath from all Ages che|cheri&s;ht
<PB REF="17">
the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Atla&s;e's</HI>
for Invention and Art.</P>
<P>What Braine but <HI>Italian</HI>
could contrive Engines to rai&s;e
&s;o va&s;t a Moles as the <HI>Vatican
Obelisque.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve what machivillian
unheard of Weapons they de|vi&s;e
to &s;urprize an enemy un|awares.</P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> I &s;aw a pocket
Church Booke with a Pi&s;toll
hid in the binding, which turn|ing
to &s;uch a Page, di&s;charges.
A plot (I conceive) to entrap
him you hate, whil&s;t yon are at
your devotions together, when
there's lea&s;t &s;u&s;pition.</P>
<P>Another as rare, is a Pocket
&s;tone-Bow, which held under
a Cloake &s;hoots needles with
violence to pierce a mans body,
yet leaves a wound &s;carce di&s;|cernable.</P>
<P><PB REF="17">
A third is a walking &s;taffe
in appearance; at the top is a
Spring which graspt hard, at
the other end will jet forth a
Rapier with force enough to
kill at a yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>A fourth is a Gunne to bee
charg'd with winde, which for
&s;ix paces will not faile of exe|cution
with a &s;mall or no re|port.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I may adde their
curious (yet Illegall) tricks
in poy&s;on, &s;ome mortall by
&s;melling to, others that given
now, &s;hall have no operation
till many moneths after.</P>
<P>Some will attempt to poy|&s;on
Rivers if they can but finde
the Source or Fountaine; and
in <HI>Milan</HI> there &s;tands a Pillar
cald <HI>Colonna Infame,</HI> rais'd
where a Magicians hou&s;e was

of health, without which it is
very difficult to enter into any
of the Italian States or Cities, &amp;
having over night procured a

on the Sea &s;ide, but hath
no Port, the buildings are after
the Italian, &amp; it is commanded
by a &s;trong Ca&s;tle that &s;tands

of Land that turnes towards

by permi&s;&s;io~ of the Governour

&amp; having agreed for our
pa&s;&s;age in that, quitted our for|mer,
yet no &s;ooner were we in
the boat but a Tempe&s;t drove
us againe into the harbour; &s;o
that we lo&s;t that day entirely.

lay, every one in a particular

it is enough to &s;ay the Genu|e&s;ians

mighty quantity of poli&s;h't
Marble, wherewith all the
Churches are fild, e&s;pecially
<HI>San Lorenzo</HI> the Dome, and
<HI>Santo Ambro&s;io</HI> belonging to
the Je&s;uites. But that which
&s;urpa&s;&s;eth all, and is of mo&s;t
admiration, is the Chappell of
the <HI>Anunciade,</HI> begun to bee
built not many yeares &s;ince at
the expence of one Family,
(who&s;e Palace joynes to it)
yet is of &s;o incredible richne&s;&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="31">
for the red and white Marble
Pillars, and other ornaments,
that one would imagine the
revenues of a whole City could
not bee enough to rai&s;e &s;o glo|rious

when tis fini&s;ht. Finally, the
Genue&s;ians to defend this their
brave City, have encompa&s;t it
with Walls no le&s;&s;e commen|dable
for beauty and &s;trength,
then prodigious for their large
extent. The people of this
Common-wealth are habited
all alike, &s;omewhat tending to|wards
the Spani&s;h Mode; and
are of a very au&s;tere and &s;u|perbe
humour, hardly vouch|&s;afing
to look &s;o low as a &s;tran|ger,
wherefore having with
much &s;atisfaction &s;eene their

pa&s;&s;engers, chiefly &s;trangers hi|ther,
they will &s;o delay their
departure, pretending the in|conveniences
of the weather,
that by lying &s;till at &s;o great an

to give them their pay, and
to hire hor&s;es for the re&s;t of

wee were forc't to &s;uffer pati|ently,
after a day and halfes at|tendance

<P>Which City was hereto|fore

line the Dukes of <HI>Etruria</HI> &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
runne, this with many
other noble cities, was reduced
to the great Dukes &s;ubjection.
From whom it hath received
many Embelli&s;ments. Tis &s;itu|ated
in a Mar&s;hy land, &s;o that
the unhole&s;omne&s;&s;e of the aire
renders it &s;carce of the native
people, much more of &s;tran|gers
<PB N="19" REF="33">
which &s;eldome tarry any
longer then to &s;ee the rarities of
the place. Among&s;t which I
preferre that worthy peece of
arte the Falling Tower which
travellers boa&s;t of, (and not un|de&s;ervedly)
as one of the mo&s;t
mervellous things they &s;ee in
the voyage of <HI>Italy.</HI> Tis cover'd
round with galleries &amp; 7. rowes
one above another of Marble
Pillars, &s;o that 'tis hard to bee
imagin'd by what engines &s;o
great a &s;tructure &s;hould be &s;up|ported,
it being built &s;o decli|ning
to one &s;ide, that all men
which regard it, at the fir&s;t ex|pect
its fall. Hard by is the <HI>Do|me</HI>
or Cathedrall Church of <HI>Pi|&s;a;</HI>
where three&s;core Pillars
te&s;tifie as well its Antiquity,
as the Gates of Bra&s;&s;e its rarity.
Joyning to this is the <HI>Campo
Santo,</HI> or <HI>Cimetiere</HI> firm'd in
<PB N="20" REF="34">
with a wall of Marble, and
much re&s;embles a Cloy&s;ter; in
the mid&s;t is the Church yard
from whence the place hath its
denomination, that implies the
holy Field; becau&s;e halfe the
ground was brought from <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
and it hath a particu|lar
propriety, that all bodies
which are buried there, are
con&s;um'd within the &s;pace of
40. houres. Here are likewi&s;e
re&s;erv'd many Ancient Urnes,
which, with the &s;tory of the
Old and New Te&s;tament pain|ted
of old worke, make the
place very venerable. Hard by
is the Bapti&s;tary, or <HI>San Gio|vanni;</HI>
wherein, the Font,
and pulpit leaning on foure
Lyons, will for the preciou&s;|ne&s;&s;e
of the &s;tone, yield to no
other in <HI>Italie.</HI> Leaving the
<HI>Area</HI> where the&s;e things &s;tand
<PB N="21" REF="34">
together, a little more into the
towne is the Chappell and Pa|lace,
of the Knights of the Or|der
of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> the Fron|te&s;piece
of the Chappell is of
Marble neatly polli&s;h't. The
in&s;ide is adorn'd with the true&s;t
En&s;ignes of Valour; I meane
Trophees taken from the com|mon
enemies of Chri&s;tianity,
the Turkes. Before their Pa|lace
is the &s;tatue of the great
Duke <HI>Co&s;mus,</HI> with a Fountain.
This Dignity of Knighthood
is much like to that of <HI>Malta,</HI>
both to maintain Chri&s;ts cau&s;e
again&s;t the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> yet
the&s;e may marrie, the others
I conceive may not: The&s;e
weare a red Cro&s;&s;e for their
badge in this fa&s;hion. &cross; From
hence we walk't to the Phy&s;iti|ans
garden, which is more for
u&s;e then delight; although there
<PB N="22" REF="35">
be good walks, &amp; water-works
that well wa&s;ht us, yet for the
mo&s;t 'tis cover'd with &s;imples,
outlandi&s;h Plants and the like.
Joyning to it is a gallery very
commodious for Medecinall
things, it abounding with all
curio&s;ities of Nature, as for|reign
creatures, Stones, Mine|ralls,
and what&s;oever &s;trange
the farthe&s;t Indies produce. In
generall, this City &s;tands &s;o op|portunely,
as few like for the
receiving of all forreign Wares.
In the mid&s;t thereof runnes the
river <HI>Arno,</HI> from thence to its
Embu&s;chment navigable for
very great Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that here
is a place where the Duke
builds his Gallies: On one &s;ide
of the river, is a faire &s;treet cald
<HI>Longarno,</HI> where is the great
Dukes Palace, and before it the
&s;tatue of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the third;
<PB N="23" REF="35">
On the other &s;ide is the Ex|change,
little, but of Marble,
then which nothing more
common in <HI>Italy.</HI> In a word,
'tis pray&s;e enough, to &s;ay tis
the third City under the great
Duke, who I thinke hath the
faire&s;t of what Prince &s;oever.
Having taken a &s;atisfactory
view hereof, we went on our
way to <HI>Ligourne,</HI> whither there
is an hourely convenience of a
Coach to tran&s;port Merchan|di&s;e
from <HI>Ligorne</HI> to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> the
Duke hath made an artificiall
Channell, of 15. miles long,
which bares &s;mall boates like
to Venetian <HI>Gondoloes.</HI> The
E&s;clu&s;e of which Channell we
&s;aw at our &s;etting forth out of
<HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> cover'd for 250. paces.
The mo&s;t part of the way to
<HI>Ligorne</HI> is through Fennes, till
one enters into the great Dukes

Forre&s;t, which continues to the

<P><HI>Ligorne</HI> the only maritimate
place of importance, under the
Great Duke, is &s;ituated in a
plaine, at the board of the <HI>Me|diterranean
Sea,</HI> tis but little,
yet the great concur&s;e of Mer|chants
which flow thither from
all Nations, chiefly from my
one, make it more &s;poken of
than many Cities, of a larger
extent. 'Tis an innumerable
&s;umme of money the Duke re|ceives
yearly from this &s;mall
Port: wherefore his Predece&s;|&s;ors
with him have omitted no|thing
to make it &s;trong, wit|ne&s;&s;e
the royall Ba&s;tions, and
mote wherewith tis fenct; The
great Port where the Ships lay
at Anchor, is defended by the
Mole, and about hath many
fanalls. The <HI>Darcina,</HI> where
<PB N="25" REF="36">
the Gallies (then but &s;ix in
number) lay as quiet as in a
Chamber, is mo&s;t exqui&s;itely
well contriv'd: Before &s;tands
that be&s;t of moderne Statues,
the Duke <HI>Ferdinand</HI> in Marble,
and the <HI>Colo&s;ses</HI> of foure &s;laves
under him, in bra&s;&s;e in divers
Po&s;tures, &s;o lively repre&s;ented,
that if the Statuary could have
fram'd a voice as well as tho&s;e
bodies, he might have con|querd
nature. Be&s;ides this
piece, there are no more curio|&s;ities
in this towne, yet many
conveniences. The &s;treets are
generally large, the hou&s;es low,
but uniforme, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome
which have been put out of or|der
by an Earthquake, to
which this place is often Sub|ject.
The great place is very
beautifull, and fit for the a&s;|&s;emblies
of Merchants. On the
<PB N="26" REF="37">
hou&s;es round about and in the
faire&s;t &s;treets, are pictur'd all the
battels, and victories of the
great Dukes gallies, obtained
over the <HI>Turks,</HI> which a &s;lave
did to gaine his redemption.
The <HI>Jewes</HI> which are here in
great number, have the faire&s;t
Synagogue I ever yet &s;aw,
wherin on a &s;aturday their Sab|baoth,
we &s;aw the manner of
their divine (if &s;o I may call it)
&s;ervice. Their priviledges here
are more then ordinary, they
wearing no marke of di&s;tincti|on
as in other Townes, &s;o that
here the wealthier and richer
&s;ort are of that Sect. The
<HI>Greeks</HI> likewi&s;e have a Congre|gation,
and Church here. In
a word, <HI>Ligorne</HI> is compacted
of forreigners, yet the un|whol&s;omene&s;&s;e
of the aire ba|ni&s;heth
a great part from
<PB N="27" REF="37">
thence, which I by dangerous
experience found true; for the
day before I was to depart
for <HI>Florence,</HI> (having all the
while I &s;tayed at <HI>Ligorne</HI> found
a &s;trange alteration of the aire,
different both from that of

di&s;pos'd to &s;ickne&s;&s;e, however,
not &s;o much but that I adven|tur'd

though with much difficulty I
perfected. The fir&s;t night we lay
at <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> which way we had for|merly
