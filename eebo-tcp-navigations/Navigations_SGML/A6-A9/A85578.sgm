<P>YOur ju&s;t dealing with your Adver&s;aries, is matter of real Honour to your Per&s;on, your Enemies them&s;elves being Judges; your in&s;tructing the ignorant, your rebuking the ob&s;tinate; your remitting the Penitent; your remitting the Innocent; your keeping Co|venant and condition of Articles with all men, have mani|fe&s;ted your proceedings both of War and Peace, to be truly Honourable to them, but e&s;pecially to Us, who have heard how <HI>Judah</HI>-like <HI>you have ruled with God, and have bin faithfull with the Saints,</HI> Ho&s;. 11. la&s;t. Your &s;ilence before
<PB N="4" REF="3">the Lord, when a Cloud was upon the Camp) had great confidence, when the Lord went before you like a Pillar of Fire by night, &s;hining upon your wayes, and telling you, that you &s;hould be to your Enemies, as thre&s;hing In&s;tru|ments with teeth; And this your confidence in God, what boldne&s;s wrought it before the Battle? and what humble|ne&s;s of mind after the Victory? refu&s;ing honour of men, when God had put glory upon you, in &s;ight of all the world. It may be &s;aid, <HI>Before honour goeth humility.</HI> Prov. 15.22. That may be an humblene&s;s, as of nece&s;&s;ity; but that humblene&s;s which followeth honour, is ever matter of la&s;ting prai&s;e; for, <HI>Honour upholdeth the humble in &s;pirit,</HI> and victory over a mans &s;elf is the greate&s;t conque&s;t: <HI>For|tior e&s;t qui &s;e, quam qui forti&s;&s;ima vincit Maena.</HI> Yea, this your confidence uttered did put life into your Coun&s;els, courage into your Re&s;olutions, and made your Forces more forcible and active, &s;o as they did the work of the Lord effective, both at <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> For there fell down many &s;lain, becau&s;e the War was of God, 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 5.22. God is the Iudge him&s;elf to whom both Parties at <HI>Dunbar</HI> made their appeales, God has pleaded the Cau&s;e of his People, and &s;ince the&s;e appeales hath given &s;entence for you now twice. The i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t no longer pa&s;s under the vain titles of meer events and chances of War. It hath been the wonder of all Lands to hear of <HI>England,</HI> how the meek of the earth here, have formerly born all manner of yoaks and oppre&s;&s;ions under Royal and Epi&s;copal Rulers, and how they have lately ri&s;en like Gyants and men of might, for recovering their Liberties, to defend their ju&s;t Rights and to bring wrong-doers to condigne puni&s;hment. As if the judgment (again&s;t <HI>Moab</HI>) written, had been &s;eal|ed upon their hearts, <Q>Cur&s;ed is he that doth the Work
<PB N="5" REF="3">of the Lord negligently, and cur&s;ed is he that with|holdeth his &s;word from bloud,</Q> <HI>Ier,</HI> 48.10. Neither regard|ing Nature nor Nations, that they might execute God had &s;aid, <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s not Moab,</HI> Deut. 2.9. till <HI>Moab</HI> had thus &s;inned. But after <HI>Moab</HI> had committed Idolatry (a &s;in a|gain&s;t the Nation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) he &s;hall bear his cur&s;e, that &s;pares <HI>Moab:</HI> any former command of God to the contra|ry notwith&s;tanding. Sinfull mens changes ju&s;tifie God and good men, in the&s;e changes of Times. Now <HI>England</HI> is delivered from her Enemies, and the people dwell &s;afely through the mercy of God under your hand, We humbly de&s;ire this, that after all publike expeditions again&s;t open enemies, you may (now) keep your &s;elves from foes of your own Hou&s;hold, from friends of your own Councel; for Chri&s;t him&s;elf was betrayed with a ki&s;s, wounded in the hou&s;e of his friend: Gallant <HI>Iudas</HI> was treacherou&s;ly flain by <HI>Demetrius:</HI> And good <HI>Ionathan</HI> captivated by <HI>Triphon</HI> pretending kindne&s;s to him. <Q LANG="lat">Cura teip&s;um, cautus e&s;to, ne fidas.</Q> Set the Lord God alwayes before you, wait for his coun&s;el; let impartial ju&s;tice be your greate&s;t de|&s;ign and be not perverted by envy or flattery of men; So run that you may obtain, in due time you &s;hall reap, if you faint not. Couragiou&s;ly follow the Captain of your Sal|vation, patiently carry the cro&s;s after him, and let us pray for the peace of the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI></P>

<P>IT was an old que&s;tion of one <HI>Hetru&s;cus, Whether a Chri|&s;tian may in any ca&s;e go to war?</HI> Its an&s;wered, he may; for <HI>to do ju&s;tice and judgment, is more acceptable then &s;acrifice,</HI> Prov. 24.3. And its an&s;wered by <Q><BIBL>O&s;orius de Nobilit. Chri|&s;tian. lib. 3.</BIBL>Re&s;publica non po&s;&s; it &s;tabiliri, ni&s;i armorum pre&s;idio, qui millitem tollit, Rempublicam funditus evertit: Chri&s;tus politeias non eripuit, &s;ed in melius in&s;truit.</Q> The Common|wealth cannot be &s;tabli&s;hed, unle&s;s it be guarded with arms. Take away the Souldier, and ye overturn the Common|wealth. Chri&s;t would not aboli&s;h Civil Governments, but form them for the better: he neither took <HI>the Axe</HI> from the Judges; nor did <HI>Paul</HI> deny the <HI>Sword</HI> to the Magi|&s;trates; nor did <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> di&s;arm the Souldiers, but pre|&s;cribed them Lawes of Innocency and moderation, <HI>Do vio|lence to no man, and be content with your wages,</HI> Luk. 3.13. yea, <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Magi&s;trate a Mini&s;ter of God to thee for good, thou doing well; and &s;aith, he bears the Sword to execute wrath upon them that do evil. Indeed, it were to be wi&s;hed by every Chri&s;tian, that all men may contain them|&s;elves from doing evil, that there were not this occa&s;ion gi|ven for puni&s;hment, and for war; The boldne&s;s of Vice mu&s;t be reproved by the couragiou&s;ne&s;s of Vertue. Our Fathers of old were led by the Spirit for the rebuking Malefact|ors; and we know that vengeance in a private matter be|comes valour in the ca&s;e of a Commonwealth. Patience in per&s;onal injuries, does in National wrongs a&s;&s;ume a magna|nimity invincible, as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did; and it was a fruit of their peace with God, when our Fathers undertook <HI>Sancti&s;sima
<PB N="7" REF="4">Bella contra &s;celeratos,</HI> mo&s;t holy wars again&s;t notorious offenders; for what peace? &s;o long as <HI>Jezabels whoredomes, and her witchcrafts are &s;o many?</HI> The end of War upon the wicked, &s;hould be the quietne&s;s and peace of tho&s;e that are godly and hone&s;t. Humbly acquaint your &s;elves with God, and be at peace among your &s;elves. Couragiou&s;ly follow the Captain of your Salvation, patiently carry his Cro&s;s after him, faithfully commit the &s;afe keeping of your &s;ouls in well-doing to him, and let us pray al&s;o for the peace of Englands Common-wealth, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>THe be&s;t way to &s;ettle the Common-wealth in a firm and la&s;ting peace, is to look back to Rules of Equity and Iu&s;tice, to principles of Nature, and Right-Rea&s;on, to Gods Law, and good Con&s;cience; and every one of you mu&s;t contribute your utmo&s;t hereunto: That power lyeth in you; and there is now recovered your right to u&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">.
