<HEAD>The Royal Pilgrimage.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HErodotus</HI> the Hi&s;torian hath left us a remarkable pa&s;&s;age of one <HI>Sethon</HI> on <HI>Aegyptian</HI> King, who being for&s;aken through the ba&s;ene&s;&s;e and pu&s;illanimity of his own Souldiers addre&s;&s;ed his Devotions to the gods for deliverance, who in an&s;wer to his Petiti|on &s;ent an Army of Mice into his enemy <HI>Senacribs</HI> Ho&s;t, which did eat the Quivers of the Souldiers, and the Leather which was u&s;ed about their Shields and Armor; upon which Omen <HI>Senacribs</HI> Army fled, &s;o giving King <HI>Sethon</HI> and his people a wonderful deliverance, which cau|&s;ed his Subjects to erect an Image of Stone to the memory of <HI>Sethon,</HI> with a Mou&s;e in his hand in the Temple of <HI>Uulcan,</HI> with this In&s;cription, <HI>He that looketh on me let him be Religious.</HI> The Story is Heathen, there|fore profane, yet had it been fabulous it had borne a morall pertinent to our Sovereigns &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t leave the application to the ingenious, and fall upon the &s;ad reher&s;al of &s;ome remarkable per&s;ecutions, through which his Sacred Maje&s;ty hath pa&s;&s;ed during the &s;pace of 12 years, which number he hath compleated, &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ed Soul of his glorified Father was tran&s;lated from this vale of mi&s;ery, to the hill of eternall happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After the threnitique &s;orrows, <MILESTONE N="1"> and unmea&s;urable tears which he had poured forth upon the ever to be lamented Remains of his Royal and mo&s;t glorious Father, in his own private lamentations, He was not for a long time without daily motives to renew griefs, which found a Chan|nel in every vi&s;it to invade his oppre&s;&s;ed Spirit; Where was the Com|forter, or who came within his drowned &s;ight and did not renew or en|large the &s;treams of his &s;orrow? Yea, the very fountains of Natures &s;trength in his Maje&s;ty, were &s;o &s;tormed with afflictions, as in youth he became gray-headed, which is the unflattering evidence of a wounded Spirit, which none can bear without the &s;anctified &s;upportation of a wonderworking God.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of relief or con&s;olation in this &s;torm of &s;orrows, <MILESTONE N="2,"> wherein His Maje&s;ty was buryed up, only with the Arms of Angels, he had an oppor|tunity to ta&s;t the gratitude of that people where he then lived, whom his Predece&s;&s;ors had redeemed and protected from &s;uch puni&s;hments as Traitors incur, but in their ballance His weighty cau&s;e was found Light,
<PB N="2" REF="3">and <HI>Holland</HI> mu&s;t now no longer be his Sanctuary, but the reception of his profe&s;&s;ed Enemies, a Den of Theeves and Murtherers like the In|habitants, and the Patient King even in the greenne&s;s of His Greifs was forced to carry his bleeding heart into another Nation, who&s;e King and Princes might probably endeavour to reverge his wrongs becau&s;e they held their Veyns dignified by clayming an intere&s;t in His highborn blood; <MILESTONE N="3"> But there al&s;o He was likewi&s;e refre&s;hed in His Mournings: for he found him&s;elf cen&s;ured and de&s;pi&s;ed by the Magnates the proude&s;t Princes on the earth, whil&s;t their mo&s;t mi&s;erable Plebeyans and Pe&s;ants adored his Maje&s;ty and &s;tiled him, not unju&s;tly the Deliverer, the Re|deemer, the Saviour of their Country.</P>
<P>Wearyed with the unnaturall, and unthankful Retorts which his Ma|je&s;ttique merits received from the Kick&s;haw Court of <HI>France,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4"> he re|turned among&s;t the Dutch Bores, who by this time had handfa&s;ted a Treacherous amity with his Maje&s;ties Rebellious and Murtherous Subjects, &s;o as there was no more &s;afety for him with them, then if he or his Arce&s;tors had been their mortall enemyes, without who&s;e coun|tenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they, even tho&s;e ungratefull States, had long before been Vagabonds.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the&s;e things as they could be no le&s;s then &s;ad and greivous unto his Maje&s;ty: &s;o the formidable &s;equels were to be timely prevented, for the Wa&s;ps and Hornets of his Rebells &s;warmed in every corner of the Netherlands, &s;o as their &s;editious infection be|came to be Epidemique; <MILESTONE N="5"> Therefore his Maje&s;ty finding him&s;elf under another variation of King <HI>Davids</HI> &s;treights, he cho&s;e rather to hazzard his Royal per&s;on upon the hollow hearts of his Scotti&s;h Subjects then longer to tru&s;t upon the Dutch fal&s;e Friends; who loved and feared him alike for his Impotency or Power.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e his undaunted Re&s;olution betook to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which Voyage the Tempe&s;tuous Sea entertained him with ju&s;t &s;uch Civi|lities, <MILESTONE N="6"> as his incon&s;tant Friends had done in their Territories, neverthe|le&s;s it plea&s;ed God to bring him &s;afe into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where his fir&s;t work was to u&s;e his <HI>Solomons</HI> wi&s;dome to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the true and fal&s;e hearts of tho&s;e his Subjects, who&s;e infidelity he had too late|ly experimented, and had now no more a&s;&s;urance of their Loyalty then their bare word, yet finding &s;ome regret in the multitude, he began to have a better opinion of the Nobility, then many of them de&s;erved, for upon narrower enquiery he was &s;oon &s;atisfied that the Core and Dreggs of Rebellion remained &s;till in the more powerfull of them, but his Maje&s;ty was re&s;erved, and the&s;e Lords held it policy to comply with
<PB N="3" REF="3">him in popular appearance, though otherwi&s;e they entertained and wel|comed him with a double heart.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having taken that his Kingdome and Crown upon him with &s;uch Ceremony as that Nation could afford, finding that the Ty|rannous U&s;urper <HI>Cromwell</HI> did daily get ground upon him, took Coun|cell with his Nobles for a march into <HI>England,</HI> which accordingly he un|dertook with a numerous Army, and came in &s;afety to the City of <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> where expecting an encrea&s;e of Loyall hearts, he was againe Trea|cherou&s;ly made acce&s;&s;ary to his own ruine; <MILESTONE N="7"> for his Generall <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> (up|on which name the Cur&s;e of God is in all likelihood intayled) having been according to his Country faction, beforehand corrupted by <HI>Crom|well</HI> and his Rumpers, this &s;acred King was againe betrayed by that damned <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> and through his Maje&s;ties own Gallantry, he was well nigh &s;urprized by his Engli&s;h Rebells, having a Hor&s;e or two &s;laine un|der his Royal per&s;onage.</P>
<P>There then remained no hopes but withall &s;peed to make an ingeni|ous e&s;cape, di&s;gui&s;es were now his be&s;t Armour, and God who was ever with him in his greate&s;t need, becau&s;e he had a favour towards him, was plea&s;ed to pro&s;per the de&s;ignes of the few true-hearted Lords which were about his Maje&s;ty, &s;o as after many wandrings for the &s;pace of about two months, he e&s;caped into France, where he needed no infor|mation of that Courts could compa&s;&s;ion towards him; <MILESTONE N="8"> But the Wi&s;|dome and Providence of God were always with his Maje&s;ty, and he re|ceived the Court holy water as truly Sanctifyed Con&s;olations, and &s;o endeavoured really to requite them; For the differences fallen be|tween the Prince of <HI>Condy</HI> and the <HI>Cardinall Mazarine,</HI> had begotten unattoneable &s;idings and factions even in the great City of <HI>Paris,</HI> where the Prince became, &s;o advanced with his Country-men as the Cardinal was deba&s;ed in their e&s;teem, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> which were read, to en|ter the City were diverted by the great prudence of our Soveraign: So as Statues were erected in Honour of his Maje&s;ty whom thereon they entitled the Deliverer the Redeemer, and Saviour of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s they &s;oon ex&s;punged the&s;e Obligations, and their own Con&s;anguinityes were as quite forgotten, as if they had not been le|gitimate, they did not onely hearken to the Enchantments of his Ser|pentlike Enemyes, but they pre&s;ently &s;trook up an Amity and League with the U&s;urper of his Inheritance, the Blood&s;ucker of his Glorious Father, the Trapparner of his Loyal Subjects, and as &s;oon as the In|cendiacy, the Touch and Go of all Deva&s;tations had &s;truck fire upon the <HI>French</HI> Tinder, which immediately embraced the Sparkle, the
<PB N="4" REF="4">flames of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> began again to break forth, &amp; <HI>Oliver</HI> the Demo|niack towards his King, and the Elect over his Countrey, whom none but the Devil and he only (by &s;ympathetical re&s;emblance) could endure, was now the only favourite of <HI>France,</HI> and its Guardian <HI>Mazarixe.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore his Sacred Maje&s;ty the <HI>Job</HI> like &s;ervant of God mu&s;t now undergo new per&s;ecutions, for beholding with amazement his Cozen King &s;o <HI>French</HI> like, mutable as neither con&s;anguinity, Faith, nor poli|tique prudence would keep firmer that Prince who calls him&s;elf the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, his Maje&s;ty left him&s;elf to his new contract with a Reed of <HI>Egypt,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> that perjured Traytor, that pe&s;t of his time, the accur&s;ed parent, and ma&s;ter of a Vagabond generation, and Fugitive Va&s;&s;alage <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who within the time of very few proceeding years, no man would tru&s;t for fix penniworth of victuals, yet this Varlet rai&s;ed a new &s;torm, and his patient Chri&s;t like Maje&s;ty mu&s;t flee to act another Scene of <HI>French</HI> fortunes Incon&s;tancie, even where him&s;elf could find a Reception.</P>
<P>From <HI>France,</HI> perfideous <HI>France,</HI> This Son of heaven (not having whereon to re&s;t his head; to whom all &s;orrows were &s;anctified) removes into the more con&s;tant Climate of <HI>Germany,</HI> where the Religious Em|perior entertained our Soveraign Lord with an upright heart, and a Sacred &s;ence of his unju&s;t per&s;ecutions, in imitation of who&s;e piety the in|feriour Princes of the Empire grew even into emulation which of them &s;hould fir&s;t enjoy his Maje&s;ties Royal pre&s;ence, <MILESTONE N="11"> but a &s;nake &s;till &s;lept in his innocent bo&s;ome for one <HI>Manning</HI> a mi&s;crerant &s;ervant, having received a &s;op from Satan <HI>Oliver,</HI> &s;o in&s;inuated into his Dove-like Maje&s;ty as he got re&s;idency about the Kings Bedchamber, and an unex&s;pected intere&s;t in his Privacies, and herein the providence of God, which had ever clo&s;ely attended his Sacred Protection began to cooperate with his Wi&s;dom, who like a true Son of <HI>Solomon</HI> miraculou&s;ly di&s;covered this Serpent of &s;ubtility, and Childe of perdition, and in &s;hort his Laws, Maje&s;ty who was but a &s;o journer and no Soveraign of that Countries found help with the Noble Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> to do him to death, the &s;tory is familiarly known.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having &s;pent &s;ometime among&s;t tho&s;e Cordial Chri&s;tian Princes, and received magnificent expre&s;&s;ions from his Emperial Maje|&s;ty, he was invited by another branch of that mo&s;t Chri&s;tian <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Family into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Maje&s;ty of <HI>Spain</HI> added another golden linke to that chain of Piety which all his Chri&s;tian Ance&s;tors had worn, for &s;ome years his Maje&s;ty &s;o journed in that Territory, <MILESTONE N="12"> but not without tho&s;e Serpents which &s;pawned and crawled about his very heart-blood,
<PB N="5" REF="4">&s;o as what&s;oever his Maje&s;ty did, or undertook to do, was conveyed by the unclean Fowls of the Air to <HI>Oliver</HI> in whom they built their Ne&s;ts; But the Devils them&s;elves are limited and <HI>Oliver</HI> departed to his own place.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had his Son <HI>Richard</HI> &s;wept the Hou&s;e, but the &s;maller De|vils of <HI>Oliver</HI> returned, and brought in 7 more wi&s;e then them&s;elves, which daily &s;o multiplyed, as by their witchcrafts, <HI>England,</HI> which was &s;uddainly grown into &s;uch &s;erenity, as a cloud was &s;carce to be &s;een as big as a mans hand, when in an in&s;tant the three Kingdoms were covered over with hideous darkne&s;s, and new &s;torms ari&s;e; The Devils playd their own parts, and quarrelled within them&s;elves for Supremacy; In which combu&s;tion the Loyalty of Sir <HI>George Booth</HI> gave light to others, and they al&s;o became illu&s;trious, and now the remaining Imps at home, <HI>Thurloe</HI> Satan-<HI>Olivers</HI> Clark together with his more Diabolique Ma&s;ter, watered and new planted che Gatden for the Snakes, which as yet were hidden in his Maje&s;ties Pallace where ever he removed; For the King hearing that his Loyal Subjects about <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> began to Li&s;t, and embody for his Re&s;tauration, like a true-Chri&s;tian Prince, thought him&s;elf bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t,, at lea&s;t with his Royal pre&s;ence, tho&s;e valiant and loyal undertakers of His Cau&s;e. And therefore employs one whom he had at all turns, both in giving and forgiving, obliged to his mo&s;t tru&s;ty &s;ervice, but the Angels them&s;elves fell, and the Wall of his Ser|vants fidelity was built of mud, and tempered with corruption; for his Maje&s;ties enemies (made &s;o by the unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own proper Revenues) &s;oon found the pul&s;e of this his-<HI>Judus</HI> like &s;ervants and they gave him mony, who wanted not that but a &s;incere con&s;cience, and being by his Maje&s;ty entru&s;ted to guide him to a &s;afe Landing, whereby his Maje&s;ty might with his Royal pre&s;ence encourage and &s;trengthen the willing hands of his Loyal Subjects, <MILESTONE N="13"> was by his &s;aid &s;ubtile Agent di|rected into a pit of de&s;truction, in &s;o much as his Maje&s;ty did without &s;u&s;pition of any danger ut three times to Sea, intending to Land in his County of <HI>Kent,</HI> where this Villain had purpo&s;ely directed him to meet his certain ruine whom God ever Guard.</P>
<P>But the all provident eye and hand of God defended his Sacred Maje&s;ty, and now the God of all goodne&s;s who has tryed his Maje&s;ties Faith and con&s;tancy to Religion and moral Vertue, as once be did <HI>Abrahams,</HI> finding a perfect heaat o dwell in the brea&s;t of that Peerle&s;s Subject General <HI>George Monk</HI> &s;o &s;anctified his &s;word, yea his word as without blow or blood&s;hed he made the &s;teely affections of the South incline and fly to that magnetique Attractive of the North, and &s;o &s;oon
<PB N="6" REF="5">and &s;trongly unanimous their bodies united, as it was no more in the power of man nor of the Devil to &s;eperate the conjunction.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, as contagious di&s;ea&s;es once &s;ubdued, do yet leave pec|cant humours which wander and break out, yea and &s;ometimes infect al&s;o, &s;o it &s;tands after this learned cure without cutting, for divers ma|litious and Phanatique &s;pirits floating among&s;t the Vulgar like the &s;pernie and &s;pawne of corrupt and venemous creatures upon the waters, have ca&s;t of frothy, and filthy, and filthy Language both again&s;t this clarified General, and his Sacred Maje&s;ty riches in &s;uch a &s;ervant then in all the earths wealth, but they are happily gotten yet no higher, then words; which though they be but wind are dangerous and puni&s;hable, yet &s;ome de&s;perado's have gone higher; For a Phanatick having cloth|ed and mounted him&s;elf as rich and &s;tately as any of the Noble Attend|ants which are joyfully gone to conduct up his Sacred Maje&s;ty to his Loyal people who&s;e Bowels yern for the fruition of him, this re&s;olute Villain was di&s;covered, &s;urprized examined and &s;earched, about whom were found five Pi&s;tolls each charged and laiden with a brace of Bullets the intention of the Rogue having been to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his ble&s;&s;ed Maje&s;ty, or his faith tryed General, or both, but the furious and mali|tious mad Dog is chained up in Newgate, and &s;hall &s;hortly be u&s;ed up at Tyburn where a dead dog bytes not.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="16"> There is yet a great deliverance unrelated, for God having touched the heart of our Mr. <HI>Moreland</HI> formerly an Agent for the u&s;urping Tyrant, and one whom his clo&s;e &s;ervices held in great e&s;teem with <HI>Oli|ver,</HI> having al&s;o been &s;ometimes tru&s;ted with the Li&s;t or Chain of <HI>Oli|vers</HI> Vermine about the King, did lately repair to his Maje&s;ty, before whom, after he had unfainedly demon&s;trated his humiliation, he drew forth the names of &s;uch Vipers and Serpents, as had in the&s;e twelve years lived by &s;ucking at his Royal heart blood, of whom it is &s;aid their were above 40 to whom his own and <HI>Thurloe</HI>'s hand had from time to time paid Pen&s;ions, who are now like to get the &s;urer wages and rewards for their <HI>Judas</HI> like &s;ervices.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="17"> We have it al&s;o for certain, that &s;ome Seamen had conbined to blow up the Royal Ship in which his Sacred Maje&s;ty was to be tran&s;|ported, but the con&s;piracy being timely di&s;covered, the wretched Vil|lains are &s;aid to be &s;ecured, and &s;peedily to be hanged and quartered. So peri&s;h all the enemies of my Lord the King, whil&s;t upon him&s;elf his Crown flouri&s;h <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
