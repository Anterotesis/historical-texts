<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now a con&s;iderable time, &s;ince this Relation was put into my Hands by my very good Friend the Sieur <HI>Le Maire,</HI> upon his return from the Voyage which he perform'd into tho&s;e Countries, whereof he has given us a De&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>The Reading of it &s;eem'd &s;o diverting, and the Account &s;o &s;ingular, that at first &s;ight it appear'd to me not a little &s;u&s;pected, &s;ince it differs in many E&s;&s;en|tial things from an Author of this Age, in a Collection which he has made Pub|lick.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>The&s;e Important Contradictions, made me re&s;olve to be &s;atisfied of the Truth, by tho&s;e who accompanied my Friend in his Travels: I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to have particular Conferences with each of them, e&s;pecially upon tho&s;e Heads which &s;eem'd &s;o oppo&s;ite in the&s;e different Re|lations; and I found them &s;o corre&s;pond|ing in the Matters of Fact, which crea|ted my Scruples, that I believ'd I could not better repair the Inju&s;tice I had done my Friend, than by revoking my Doubts, and repo&s;ing a Confidence in him, which till then I had &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> Director-General of the <HI>Affrican</HI> Company, under whom my Friend made this Voyage, who has acquir'd a perfect knowledge of the Lives and Manners of the Inhabitants of the&s;e I&s;lands, and of the Curio&s;ities of the&s;e Countries, by his long Travels, almo&s;t through all the Parts of the World; (which has procur'd him the E&s;teem of the Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Colbert</HI> and <HI>Soignelay</HI>) the Conferences (I &s;ay) which I had with
<PB REF="5">him, did not a little contribute to deter|min in favour of this latter Relation, which he found to be very exact, and that the Author had enter'd into Parti|cularities, which till now were never touch'd upon by any Per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>My Friends, who had look'd it over, concluded that I had injur'd the Publick in concealing this Novelty &s;o long, and did at length per&s;wade me to alter my Re&s;olution of not Publi&s;hing this Piece till the return of the Author, who would, no doubt, have made a con&s;iderable Addition of new Remarks. But &s;ince 'tis four or five Years &s;ince I heard any thing of him, I thought I &s;hould do him no wrong in Publi&s;hing the Fruits of his fir&s;t Voyages, which may be&s;peak a good Reception of what he him&s;elf &s;hall think fit to give us for the future; and, perhaps, the Applau&s;e of this Work may the &s;ooner engage him to Publi&s;h his Remarks of his later Travels.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Indu&s;trious Care which the Author has taken to penetrate into the par|ticulars, of the Manners, Religion, and
<PB REF="6">Politicks, of the People, who Inhabit the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> does very well merit an Univer&s;al Approbation.</P>
<P>One may take a view here of their Ori|ginal, of the Tyranny which the Kings ex|erci&s;e ever their Subjects and Neighbours, of many Petty Kings Tributary to each other, their Policy, and their manner of making War.</P>
<P>One may find here the perfidious Deal|ings of the&s;e People towards the <HI>Europeans</HI> in re&s;pect of their Traffick; the Fertility of a Country that is in no manner Cultivated; their Mi&s;eries for want of Indu&s;try and Foreca&s;t; what Animals are common in this Climate; And, in &s;hort, all things that are the mo&s;t Remarkable in the&s;e I&s;lands, and not to be met withal in other Places.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGES OF THE Sieur <HI>Le Maire</HI> TO THE <HI>Canaries, Cape-Verd, Sene|gal,</HI> and <HI>Gamby.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Had &s;erv'd in the Capacity of Chi|rurgeon to the <HI>Hotel-Dieu</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> near the &s;pace of three Years, when I receiv'd intimation, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> was ready to &s;et forwards for <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> as General Director of the Royal <HI>Affrican</HI> Company. This News created a De&s;ire in me to make the Voyage along with him. He &s;eem'd glad at the
<PB N="8" REF="7">opportunity of my Company, and after having determin'd our Agreement, he Pre&s;ented me to the Members of that So|ciety on the 14th of <HI>January</HI> 1682. who readily ratified the Articles we had before concluded.</P>
<P>After having &s;pent &s;ome time in &s;ettling my Affairs, and taking leave of my Friends, we departed for <HI>Orleans,</HI> where we took a Boat to go to <HI>Nantes</HI> along the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> We ought not in cour&s;e to have been more than three days in accompli&s;h|ing this Journey; however, it took us up &s;even or eight entirely, be&s;ides running of great ri&s;ques, and expo&s;ing our &s;elves to many dangers.</P>
<P>We had the Wind all along full in our Teeth, and &s;o &s;trong a Gale, that the Waves of this River did near equal the to&s;&s;ings of the Sea: To this inconveniency was added that of the Banks being over|flow'd, &s;o that we &s;eldom was &s;en&s;ible whether we were in, or off the Chanel. We could only di&s;cern &s;ome &s;traggling branches above Water, &s;o that we &s;ome|times fell foul upon the Trunks of Trees where Birds do build their Ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>However, at length we arriv'd at <HI>Nantes,</HI> and after having re&s;ted there for
<PB N="9" REF="7">the &s;pace of ten days, we took Hor&s;e for <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> What we &s;aw of <HI>Brettagny</HI> as we rode along, afforded no very plea&s;ant Idea, had we not already been otherways inform'd, that it was a Province rich and fertile in &s;ome places, &s;ince the whole Journey gave us no other pro&s;pect but of a Sandy Road, which occa&s;ion'd very tedious Travelling.</P>
<P>Having reach'd <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> the 4th of <HI>Februa|ry,</HI> we believ'd we &s;hould Sail in few days; but the Ve&s;&s;el was not yet in a condition, &s;he being but indifferently fitted out, and very defective in her Rigging. We were to wait till &s;he was new Ma&s;ted, and put in a capacity to bear Weather, and to Fight too if there were occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Two Months was &s;pent in refitting this Ship, which was call'd the <HI>St. Catharine;</HI> &s;he was of 400 Tun burthen, and carried 40 Guns: She was built at <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> and de&s;ign'd for a quick Sailor, and Com|manded by Captain <HI>Mon&s;egur,</HI> by the Or|der of the Members of this Company.</P>
<P>The Port of <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> where &s;he then was, is by much the be&s;t Harbour we have in the Ocean; the large&s;t Ve&s;&s;els Ride there in &s;afety, and lye as it were in a Chamber &s;heltred from all manner of prejudice from
<PB N="10" REF="8">the blu&s;tring Winds, for which rea&s;on it has receiv'd that Name; they can go out to Sea as well at low Water as at high Tide, &s;ince the Ships there always ride a|float: Its Entrance is as narrow as the Mouth of a River, fortified of each &s;ide with two good Half-Moons, and on the Right has a &s;tately Ca&s;tle of Antick Build|ing to defend the Pa&s;&s;age. This Haven &s;hoots up in a Spiral Line; it is a large half League in length, and about 200 Pa|ces over, &s;ituated between two Hills: All which Advantages are the pure effects of Nature.</P>
<P>I &s;aw in this Port the fine&s;t and large&s;t Ships in the whole World; among&s;t the re&s;t, the Admiral call'd the <HI>Royal Sun,</HI> &s;he is not &s;o richly Gilt as the <HI>Royal Lewis of Thoulon,</HI> but &s;he is better Built, of a greater length, and a more nimble Sailor. She carries a Hundred and Twenty Pieces of Cannon, and fortified with three Decks; her State-Room is Magnificent, curiou&s;ly Gilt and Beautified; her Plat|form was de&s;ign'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Brun,</HI> &s;he has about 15 more Apartments, but much le&s;s; however they are very conve|nient and hand&s;om.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8">
<P>Be&s;ides this Ve&s;&s;el, there were more than fifty other Ships, of 90, of 80, 70, 60, 50 Guns each, without taking notice of tho&s;e of lower Rates. Next to the <HI>Royal Sun,</HI> the fine&s;t are, The <HI>Queen,</HI> the <HI>Crown,</HI> the <HI>Glorious,</HI> the <HI>Brave,</HI> the <HI>Good,</HI> the <HI>Thundring,</HI> the <HI>Lightning,</HI> the <HI>Rock,</HI> and the <HI>Diamond,</HI> &amp;c. The pro&s;pect of tho&s;e va&s;t Machines, like &s;o many floating Palaces, appears delightfully a&s;toni&s;hing; nor can they be view'd without exciting a Veneration of the Pui&s;&s;ance of their Re|nowned Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el being Rigg'd and Fitted, it fell down into the Road on the 20th of <HI>March:</HI> Five of the King's Ships, well appointed, went out at the &s;ame time, four of which was to join the Fleet of <HI>Thoulon,</HI> in the Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Algiers,</HI> and the other was to Convoy &s;ome Ships belonging to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 9th of <HI>April</HI> 1682. I em|bark'd with four more of the Family that were to go along with us, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dan|court</HI> &s;taying yet at <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> In the mean while, the&s;e Gentlemen and I made a Match of Shooting, imagining it was as ea&s;ie to come on Board again as it was to
<PB N="12" REF="9">go off. The Director's Cook was brought aboard about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, in a little Skiff Row'd by two Young Lads of about eleven or twelve Years each.</P>
<P>The opportunity &s;eem'd lucky for us, and we, without con&s;idering how we &s;hould get back again, took his Boat, and went almo&s;t two Leagues off near to <HI>Ca|maret;</HI> the eager de&s;ire of our Sport, made us Land at the fir&s;t place we came to, &s;lighting the danger of climbing the Rocks that hung &s;helving over the Sea, from which I was near falling two or three &s;e|veral times.</P>
<P>After all our pains, we had not the good Fortune to meet with any &s;ub&s;tan|tial Game, but were oblig'd to take up with killing a few Larks, which at length &s;tood us in more &s;tead than we imagin'd. We left our unlucky Sport, and &s;et to a better, refre&s;hing our &s;elves with &s;ome good Wine and cold Provi&s;ions we had with us.</P>
<P>When we had con&s;um'd what Stock we had, we went aboard our &s;mall Skiff, and had &s;carce got off to Sea, when a violent Storm aro&s;e, which &s;oon put me to my Devotions, imagining that we &s;hould un|avoidably peri&s;h in a moment. One of
<PB N="13" REF="9">our Companions being exce&s;&s;ively tir'd, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep at his fir&s;t getting into the Boat, but being at length di&s;turb'd with our frequent &s;hricks, when we were got near half way to our Ve&s;&s;el, he, though not wholly awake, began to perceive the danger, and cry'd out that we &s;hould cer|tainly be lo&s;t, if we did not return a&s;hore with what &s;peed was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This Opinion &s;eem'd to us very pro|bable, &s;ince the &s;trength of our Young Water-men was very incon&s;iderable, tho' they &s;hew'd much greater courage than any of us, telling us, That the Boat would only over-turn, and that there was no danger of its &s;inking to the bottom. I &s;uppo&s;e they imagin'd that all of us could Swim; but indeed they were mi&s;taken, for I very well knew my own Ability. Sometimes I entertain'd my thoughts with the difficulty of e&s;caping among&s;t Waves that were &s;o large and violent, which I concluded would infallibly da&s;h us in pieces again&s;t the Rocks.</P>
<P>We readily embrac'd the Advice of our Comrade, and &s;et all hands to Work to Row back to &s;hore, and with much labour we gain'd the Land, to wait there till the Storm was abated.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="10">
<P>Whil&s;t each of us was reli&s;hing a &s;mall Tranquillity, we heard the report of a Cannon, and at the &s;ame time &s;aw the Top-&s;ail loos'd, which is the ordinary Sig|nal for Sailing. There were &s;ome Lighters at hand, but we could by no means find the Ma&s;ters that own'd them to carry us on Board.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;aw our Ship under Sail, Sa|luting the Admiral with &s;even Guns, the Wind full a Stern, all the Sails out, with|out hopes of regaining her. I look'd up|on my &s;elf to be in a mi&s;erable taking, without Cloaths, without In&s;truments, and expos'd to the Extremities of Fortune.</P>
<P>We follow'd the &s;ight of our Ve&s;&s;el, tearing our Throats, and firing our Fuzees, but to no purpo&s;e, &s;he in a little time di&s;|appear'd. One of our Comrades not be|ing &s;o good of Foot as the re&s;t, took the way to <HI>Camaret,</HI> believing he &s;hould find us there; for our parts we were looking after him; &s;o we &s;pent the be&s;t part of the Night &s;eeking each other.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands of Unfortunate Accidents befel us, one &s;tuck in a Bog, the other fell into a Ditch, and each call'd out upon the other for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Cur&s;ing our Sport was the common Dialect of us all.
<PB N="15" REF="10">Hunger came in the Rear of our other Misfortunes. We at length took into a &s;mall Hedge-Tavern, where, by good luck, every thing was an&s;werable to the &s;mall Stock we had to &s;pend.</P>
<P>We met with nothing there but a Cru&s;t of very brown Bread, a Scrap of <HI>Holland</HI>-Chee&s;e, and Straw Beds; the &s;mall Stock of Money we had was expended for di&s;|charging our Supper and Lodging; and for our Breakfa&s;t, we deferr'd it to a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were upon the hunt for our &s;traggling Companion, Coa&s;ting the Sea, we di&s;cover'd &s;ome Ma&s;ts, which we at fir&s;t took for Trees that grew upon the Banks of the River, not daring to flatter our &s;elves that we &s;hould ever regain the &s;ight of a Ve&s;&s;el, which we at that time imagin'd to be far di&s;tant from us; but drawing nearer, we perceiv'd that &s;he was not gone, and that &s;he lay at Anchor in the Road of <HI>Camaret,</HI> three Leagues from <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine our Joy, there was nothing now to be done but to find our lo&s;t Comrade, and &s;o go on Board. We endeavour'd to make Signs to the Peo|ple in the Ship that they might know us,
<PB N="16" REF="11">and &s;end off their Shalop, but we were no more &s;ucce&s;sful in this than in our former Enterpri&s;es.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were contriving all manner of ways to get out of this Scrape, we perceiv'd a &s;mall Bark, which hir'd her &s;elf to carry off to any Ve&s;&s;els at Sea. I can't tell how it came to pa&s;s that our &s;tray'd Comrade &s;hould be there; but &s;o it was, he was the fir&s;t that knew us. We made &s;igns to him, he under&s;tood us, and order'd the Bark to come near us; but though the &s;hore was almo&s;t unacce&s;&s;ible, upon the account of the Rocks, yet we were oblig'd to get aboard in &s;pight of all their threatning Precipices.</P>
<P>At length we got in, and after many Congratulations of being once again met together, we &s;ettled our &s;elves to repo&s;e: But it &s;eems it was not yet time to take our ea&s;e, for the Waves ro&s;e &s;o high, that they wa&s;h'd over the Boat from Head to Stern; &s;o that we were all throughly Sous'd. This, together with the Cold that it oc|ca&s;ion'd, and the danger of being over|&s;et, which our Seamen &s;eem'd to dread, renew'd our Mi&s;eries, till at la&s;t, after the&s;e unlucky Adventures, we arriv'd &s;afe aboard.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="11">
<P>We laugh'd at lei&s;ure at all the&s;e Acci|dents, and &s;et immediately to remedy our pre&s;ent Hunger: We lay &s;ometime longer in the Road to wait for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> who &s;taid at <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> He arriv'd <HI>Sunday</HI> the 12th of <HI>April</HI> 1682. about Noon, and we immediately made ready to Sail.</P>
<P>About three Leagues off at Sea, we met with the Ship call'd the <HI>Burning;</HI> &s;he Rode at Anchor waiting for the Tide to carry her into the Bay of <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> &s;he carried to Guns, and came from <HI>Haver</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> aboard Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Preuilly</HI> the Lieutenant General, and was afterwards to Sail with him for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Algier.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aluted her after the accu&s;tom'd manner, with &s;even Guns, Trumpets Sounding, and crying three times, <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e le Roy.</HI> She return'd as many, contrary to the General practice of the King's Ships, who always give two le&s;s. It ap|pear'd that it was out of Complai&s;ance to the <HI>Intendant,</HI> who was an intimate Friend of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourts,</HI> and then aboard her.</P>
<P>Having return'd our thanks with three Guns, we continued our Cour&s;e, the Wind being at North Ea&s;t, having doubled the Cape to the We&s;t, making We&s;t South
<PB N="18" REF="12">We&s;t, from whence we took our Point to Steer, at 48 degrees 20 Minutes of the Northern Latitude, and 11 degrees of Longitude. But &s;ince I am not very ex|port in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Pilotage, I &s;hall not for the future make any &s;uch particular re|cites, unle&s;s they be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 21th of <HI>April,</HI> we made two Ve&s;&s;els direct Ea&s;t of us; by their endeavours to get the Wind of us, we indg'd them to be <HI>Pirates.</HI> We put our &s;elves in a po&s;ture of Defence, which no doubt prevented their coming upon us, they gue&s;&s;ing by our Countenance that they could expect from us nothing but dry Blows.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> the 26th in the Morning, we were in 32 Degrees and as many Minutes of the Northern Latitude, and in 4 De|grees 13 Minutes of Longitude, when we made the <HI>Cape Cautin,</HI> the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Morocco,</HI> being but &s;ix Leagues from Land. Had the Night continued we had certainly peri&s;h'd, &s;ince we took our Cour&s;e for the We&s;t of <HI>Madera,</HI> which was above 140 Leagues from thence.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 29th, we made the I&s;land of <HI>Ancerott,</HI> one of the Seven <HI>Canaries,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12">which we left about 10 Leagues to the South-Ea&s;t; here we were for &s;ome time becalm'd, and &s;uffer'd the &s;corching of exce&s;&s;ive heats.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 30th of <HI>April,</HI> we were got in 28 Degrees and 30 Minutes Nor|thern Latitude, taking, according to the Cu&s;tom of our Nation, the fir&s;t Meridian from the I&s;land of <HI>Fer,</HI> having then the <HI>Grand Canary</HI> 10 Leagues from us to the North-Ea&s;t. We went off a Fowling near a League into the I&s;land, where we &s;taid till Night. We could not come to an An|chor for want of a Wind, and for the darkne&s;s of the Night which came on, which made us &s;tand off to the Ea&s;t, and continue till three hours after Midnight oppo&s;ite to Land.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> by break of day, we veer'd to the We&s;tward, taking our Cour&s;e to the <HI>Great Canary:</HI> About half an hour after Nine we came to an Anchor in 24 Fathom Water, and brought up a gray and red Sand mix'd with Coral; the Town which lay South South-We&s;t, is a League and half from the Road, and is defended by a Ca&s;tie, though very mean and de&s;picable.</P>
<P>When they perceiv'd us from off the Ca&s;tle, they hoi&s;ted the Flag of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="13">which we Saluted with five Guns; but they made no return, which I believe was occa&s;ion'd by want of Powder.</P>
<P>Anchorage is extream good in this place, &s;o that they don't draw too near the Town, who&s;e approach is render'd dan|gerous by Rocks that lye conceal'd under Water. It is Guarded by a Ca&s;tle &s;ituated upon a Hill, from the In&s;ults it might &s;uf|fer by any Ve&s;&s;els that might undertake to Attack it. 'Tis Inhabited by Twelve Thou&s;and flout I&s;landers, who are capable of making a very good Defence. Our Ship Anchor'd before the Town in 18 Fa|thom Water.</P>
<P>Its Precincts are near a League in com|pa&s;s, mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es well built, but low, having not above two Stories, they are all flat Roord, &s;o that no Ridge ap|pears, and one would be apt to take them for Hou&s;es &s;o far burnt down. In the day time, &s;carce any Body appears in the Streets.</P>
<P>Though the Bi&s;hop, the Governor, and the Men of Quality, make their Re&s;idence at <HI>Teneriff,</HI> yet the See Epi&s;copal, the Tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition, and the So|veraign Council, which is, as it were, the Parliament of the &s;even I&s;lands, are always
<PB N="21" REF="13">kept in this Capital. There is here four Religious Foundations, one belonging to the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> one to the <HI>Franci&s;cons;</HI> the two other are the <HI>Bernardins</HI> and the <HI>Recollects.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands, who heretofore were call'd the <HI>Fortunate,</HI> had that Title not without good Rea&s;on, if we con&s;ider ei|ther the Goodne&s;s and Purity of the Air, or the Fertility of the Soil. They abound in Bread-Corn, Barley, Honey, Beef, Mutton, Fowl; in &s;hort, with all Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for good and plentiful Living. They afford &s;o large a Store of <HI>Malm&s;y</HI> Sack, that <HI>France, Spain, England, Holland,</HI> and other places, are from thence furni&s;h'd every Year.</P>
<P>The felicity that the&s;e I&s;lands are capa|ble of be&s;towing above any others, in what re&s;pects commodious Living, gave, &s;ome time &s;ince, occa&s;ion to the Pagans belief.

<P>Their Harve&s;t is commonly in <HI>March,</HI> &s;ometimes in <HI>April,</HI> and in &s;everal places they are double in each Year: The Soil is &s;o Redundant, that I have &s;een a Cheriy Tree Slip produce Fruit in 6 Weeks time after it had been Grafted.

<P><HI>Grand Canary,</HI> as well as <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and the <HI>Palme,</HI> did continue &s;ome time in Idola|try after the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made in 1460. <HI>Ancerott, Fort-Avanture, Gomere</HI> and <HI>Fer,</HI> did fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;e Chri&s;tianity, and at length the other three follow'd their example.

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> was very Honourably receiv'd by the Governor of the I&s;land, at who&s;e Hou&s;e he was entertain'd at Dinner,
<PB N="23" REF="14">being conducted by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Remond</HI> Con&s;ul of our Nation, who was Born at <HI>Liege,</HI> and is a very hone&s;t Courteous Gentleman. He Regal'd us very Nobly, and let us want for neither Liquor nor Fruit; I &s;taid two entire days with him, where I receiv'd all the Civilities imagi|nable.</P>
<P>I was four times at the Convent of <HI>Bernardins,</HI> the Providore having given me that permi&s;&s;ion at the In&s;tance of the La|dy Abbe&s;s. There were here &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Ladies, among&s;t the re&s;t one from <HI>Paris,</HI> who did me the kind Service of being my Interpreter. As there were &s;ome among&s;t them that were Infirm, they omitted not the opportunity of Advi&s;ing with me, and of giving me great Re&s;pect and Attention</P>
<P>A Phy&s;ician being at hand, made &s;eve|ral of them make the be&s;t of the opportu|nity, and many of them complain'd that had no real occa&s;ion, hoping thereby to gain the greater liberty, tho' otherwi&s;e they were no how indi&s;pos'd. I &s;oon di&s;cover'd, that the greate&s;t part of them had no other Di&s;temper, but of that of be|ing Lock'd up from the re&s;t of the World, and therefore I could furni&s;h them with no Effectual Cure. However, to appear a
<PB N="24" REF="15">Per&s;on &s;omething con&s;iderable, and of Univer&s;al Experience, I order'd them &s;ome Specifick Medicines, &s;uch as was mo&s;t proper for Chimetical Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>The&s;e good Religious Ladies were not wanting in their Care&s;&s;es, and took care to load me with Biskets, dry and wet Sweet-meats, Lemonade, and Sack; to|gether with all manner of Fruit, which they had &s;erv'd up upon Plates, and Porcelain Salvers, garni&s;h'd with Ro&s;es, Pinks, Orange-Flowers, Je&s;&s;imin, and Tubero&s;es, with variety of No&s;egays. I al&s;o made them &s;ome &s;mall Pre&s;ents, which were receiv'd with great Re&s;pect and Civility.</P>
<P>When I left the&s;e good Ladies, and re|turn'd to the Con&s;ul's, there were more People that waited, to take me along with them to Vi&s;it the Sick. Particularly, I went to a certain Lawyer's e&s;teem'd worth Five hundred thou&s;and Crowns, who&s;e Wife had long labour'd with the Suffocation of the Womb, which was caus'd by &s;ome Ob&s;tructions: The Doctors of the Place dealt with her as a <HI>Peripneumony,</HI> by which chiefly I di&s;cover'd their Igno|rance.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="15">
<P>Their general di&s;tru&s;t of them, makes the Inhabitants very fond of any <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeons. The Lawyer us'd his utmo&s;t endeavours to per&s;wade me to take up my Abode in the <HI>Grand Canary,</HI> offering me his Hou&s;e, and his Table, and great Ad|vantages be&s;ides. I had no mind to forfeit the promi&s;e I made to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> &s;o that I made my returns of Acknow|ledgments for the obliging offers of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and pre&s;crib'd what Remedies I thought mo&s;t proper for his Lady, and what might be be&s;t met withal in the I&s;land; where, indeed, Medicines are very &s;carce.</P>
<P>He offer'd me a Recompence in Money, which, out of Honour for our Nation, I wholly refus'd. I had de&s;ign'd to have vi&s;ited him again in a day or two, &s;ince he had begg'd that favour of the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> adding, that he would find out &s;ome other way of gratifying me, &s;ince I refus'd his fir&s;t offer; but I had not time, the Boat being come to fetch me on Board the <HI>Sa|turday</HI> Evening.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, I was almo&s;t Enchant|ed with the Sweetne&s;s of that Country; &s;o that I could &s;carce leave it without re|gret. Should I ever quit <HI>France,</HI> it &s;hould

Before I have done with this I&s;land, I mu&s;t not forget to acquaint you, that it is about 30 Leagues in Compa&s;s, and of a Form very near Round.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> the 2d of <HI>May,</HI> in the Eve|ning, the Wind being North North Ea&s;t, we made ready about Three a Clock in the Morning; we took our Cour&s;e in the &s;ight of the <HI>Pique,</HI> a high Mountain in the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and made forwards to Ride in the Road of St. <HI>Cruce.</HI> Our Pilot ob&s;erv'd in this place, that the Compa&s;s varied to the North Ea&s;t 3 Degrees, and 30 Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> the 3d, being full North of the <HI>Grand Canary,</HI> having a gentle Breeze at North North Ea&s;t, we lay off We&s;tward from the Cape all Night.</P>
<P><HI>Monday,</HI> the 4th, in the Morning, we arriv'd at <HI>Teneriff,</HI> the Riche&s;t of all the <HI>Canaries,</HI> being in &s;ight of <HI>St. Cruce,</HI> a &s;mall Town of the &s;ame I&s;land, upon its Ea&s;tern Point. We might there have Anchor'd in 25, or 30 Fathom Water; in the mean while we
<PB N="27" REF="16">never drop'd our Anchor, but our Ship lay by all the time, expecting the return of our Shalop, which we &s;ent a&s;hore.</P>
<P>Though the Governor of <HI>St. Cruce</HI> &s;uf|fer'd tho&s;e that were in the Boat to come a&s;hore, yet he &s;ent to acquaint the Go|vernor-General, who had his Re&s;idence at <HI>Laguna,</HI> 3 Leagues from the Sea-&s;ide, that there were &s;ome <HI>French</HI> who de&s;ir'd to come on Shore to take in &s;ome Provi&s;ions, which they &s;tood in need of: Who&s;e An|&s;wer was, That he &s;hould detain them if they did it. Perhaps he fear'd that we had &s;ome Infection on Board, &s;hould we have come from the <HI>Levant,</HI> a place very &s;ubject to Contagion.</P>
<P>To what remains when I &s;peak of the <HI>Pique,</HI> I mu&s;t acquaint you by the by, that it is one of the highe&s;t Mountains in the World.

<P>As for <HI>Teneriff,</HI> it is reputed to lye the highe&s;t of any I&s;land in the Ocean, and the be&s;t Peopled for its bigne&s;s, containing
<PB N="28" REF="17">about 15000 Inhabitants: She produces that Excellent <HI>Malm&s;ey</HI> Sack, which, with|out Conte&s;t, is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t in the World. This Liquor was not known in this I&s;land, till after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, &s;ince they were the fir&s;t that tran&s;planted &s;ome Vine-Stocks from <HI>Candy;</HI> though, at this day, the Wine is ju&s;tly allow'd a preference to that from whence it owes its Original, and a much larger quantity of it is here pro|duc'd than in <HI>Candy</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>All the &s;even I&s;lands of the <HI>Canaries</HI> lye almo&s;t in a direct Line from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, they are very Mountainous, well Peopled, and extraordinary Fertil; the lea&s;t of which is 60 Miles in Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I had formerly heard Di&s;cour&s;e of a Mi|raculous Tree in the I&s;land of <HI>Fer,</HI> who&s;e Leaves were long and narrow, always green, which &s;upply'd the Inhabitants with all their Water. I had a mind to inform my &s;elf of the Truth of it, I therefore ask'd concerning it, whether &s;o great a Dew fix'd it &s;elf on this Plant, that it continu|ally di&s;till'd a clear and whol&s;om Water into Ba&s;ons of Stone &s;et on purpo&s;e to re|ceive it; &s;o that there would be, by this means, a &s;ufficient quantity both for the
<PB N="29" REF="17">Inhabitants and their Cattel, Nature kind|ly &s;upplying, by this perpetual Miracle, the want of fre&s;h Water, which was not to be met withal throughout the whole I&s;land. The Inhabitants confirm'd me in the Opinion that I had before entertain'd, that it was a meer Fable. There were, however, &s;ome that told me, that there was &s;uch a &s;ort of Trees, but that they never furni&s;h'd &s;uch prodigious quantity of Water which was &s;poke of.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 5th, we continued our Cour&s;e to the South, being in 27 Degrees 40 Minutes Northern Latitude, and in 360 Degrees Ea&s;tern Longitude. About Six a Clock in the Evening, being full South off the <HI>Grand Canary,</HI> we kept Ea&s;t North Ea&s;t for about 7 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 6th, it blew &s;o &s;trong an Ea&s;terly Wind, that the Tackling of the Top-Sail, and the Main-Yard, broke in pieces, and the Main-Ma&s;t buckled &s;o much, that it was in danger of breaking. This Wind ceas'd in a quarter of an hour, afterwards, and the Ve&s;&s;el began to be Steady and Trim.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 7th, at Noon, being in 20 Degrees Northern Latitude, and in 28 Minutes <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> Longitude, we cut the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer.</HI></P>
<PB N="30" REF="18">
<P>It was not forgot in this place, to keep up the Ceremony that is us'd by all Sailors, they call it the Bapti&s;m; 'tis put in practice upon all tho&s;e who never yet pa&s;s'd the <HI>Tropick.</HI> See here the whole De&s;cription of it. They &s;et a great Tub of Water at the foot of the Main-Ma&s;t, with a Stick laid a-cro&s;s it; Then tho&s;e, that have been Initiated in former Voyages, having Grim|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c'd their Faces with Smut, walk in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion a-round the Deck, one carrying a drawn Cut-la&s;h, another a Frying-Pan, and the re&s;t &s;everal of the Kitchen Uten|&s;ils. The Pilot, to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, turns his Coat, and Di&s;plays &s;ome tatter'd Rag in&s;tead of a pair of Colours. The Pro|ce&s;&s;ion being fini&s;h'd, which is always per|form'd in great State, with Trumpets Sounding, and Drums Beating, they pro|ceed to Baptizing of the Ship, flinging &s;e|veral Peals of Water about the Deck, till the Captain gives the Ship's Crew &s;ome Drink-Money.</P>
<P>They go then, fir&s;t, to the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable of the Ship, whom they make to &s;it, one after the other, upon the Stick I already mention'd: The Mob gets about. him, pre&s;enting a Ba&s;on to receive his Bapti&s;mal Offering, holding the Cymeter

At length they mark him with a black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">s upon the Forehead, and fling a little Water up|on his Head, which follow'd by a Pre&s;ent flung into the Ba&s;on, they di&s;mi&s;s him; tho', if it be a Per&s;on of Common Rank, they draw the Stick from under him, Sou&s;ing him into the Tub, flinging Buckets of Water upon him, and thumping him, at a good Rate, with the Stick he &s;at up|on. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of undergoing this Ceremony, nor is an Admiral him&s;elf exempted, though they u&s;e him in a more Civil manner than ordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> the 8th, we drew near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> being at Mid-day in 21 De|grees 47 Minutes Northern Latitude, the Wind blowing a fre&s;h Gale at North North Ea&s;t, we were &s;atisfied that it was impo&s;&s;ible to reach <HI>Cape-Blanc</HI> within Day|light, being 4 Leagues off from Land, ha|ving 28 Fathom Water, with a Sandy bot|tom; we kept our bent Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t, and on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th, about Eight a
<PB N="32" REF="19">Clock in the Morning, we found our &s;elves but a League from &s;hore.</P>
<P>We Coa&s;ted along to <HI>Cape-Blanc,</HI> and Anchor'd there in 14 fathom Water to the North-We&s;t, being about a League from the Point of the Cape; which is, accord|ing to our Account, in 20 Degrees 30 Mi|nutes Northern Latitude, and 359 Degrees 10 Minutes We&s;tern Longitude.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> di&s;cover'd this Cape, about the Year 1454. they gave it the Name of <HI>Cape-Blanc,</HI> by rea&s;on of its bar|ren white Sand, in&s;omuch that nothing of Green appears in view. It lies almo&s;t as flat as the Sea; on which Account 'tis call'd the <HI>Sea of Sand.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Cape-Cantin</HI> to this place, which is 300 Leagues, nothing is to be &s;een but a Flat of Sand, by the Ancients call'd, <HI>The De&s;art of Lybia,</HI> and by the Arabians <HI>Zaara.</HI> It's not Inhabited, &s;ave only with Wild Bea&s;ts, &s;uch as <HI>Lions, Tygers, Ounces, Leo|pards,</HI> and other like &s;ort of Creatures.</P>
<P>The&s;e De&s;arts are bounded on the North by <HI>Mount Atlas,</HI> and to the South by the Country of the <HI>Negers;</HI> they are of that extent from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, that they can't be cro&s;s'd on Hor&s;eback under the &s;pace of 50 days. Over the&s;e Sands, the Caravans
<PB N="33" REF="19">pa&s;s from <HI>Fez</HI> to <HI>Tombut, Melly, Borneo,</HI> and other Kingdoms of the <HI>Negers.</HI></P>
<P>When any Storm ari&s;es in the&s;e De&s;arts, the Sands overwhelm both the Pa&s;&s;engers and their Camels, often &s;mothering them to Death; at other times, filling up the &s;tanding Pits of Water, &s;o that they peri&s;h by Thir&s;t. The <HI>Caravans,</HI> for want of any beaten Track, are oblig'd to make u&s;e of the Compa&s;s as tho' they were at Sea.</P>
<P>At the Point of <HI>Cape-Blanc,</HI> there is form'd a certain Gulf which takes its Name from the I&s;land which it makes, and is call'd <HI>Arguin.</HI> This Gulf &s;hoots up more than 15 Leagues within Land, by which the pro&s;pect of it is lo&s;t having once pa&s;s'd the Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had formerly a Fort in this I&s;land, where they E&s;tabli&s;h'd a Com|merce with the <HI>Azoaghes, Arabs,</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> who Traffick'd with them for Gold, Gum-Arabick, O&s;tridges Plumes, which are there in great Plenty, by rea&s;on of the abundance of tho&s;e Birds. 'Tis &s;aid-of this Animal, that they are &s;o far de&s;titute of Memory, that they forget where they lay their Eggs, and that they brood over the fir&s;t they chance to meet withal. I much doubted the Truth of the Report,
<PB N="34" REF="20">that one of the&s;e Eggs were &s;ufficient to &s;atisfie the Appetite of eight Men of good Stomach. To the re&s;t, they bring the&s;e Merchandi&s;es from <HI>Hoden,</HI> which is four days Journey into the Main Land, and is the place where the <HI>Caravans</HI> arrive from <HI>Tombut, Gualata,</HI> and other Inland places of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and the Country of the <HI>Negers.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e People are Di&s;ciples of the Pre|cepts of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they never continue long &s;ettled in a place, but wander in the De&s;arts from one part to another, accord|ing as they meet with Pa&s;turage for their Hor&s;es, Camels, Cattel, Sheep, and Goats, by who&s;e Milk they are nouri&s;hed. They are divided into Tribes or Lineages, they own no King or Superior by any legal Right, though he that has the greate&s;t Stock is voluntarily obey'd as their Cap|tain or Conductor.</P>
<P>Their Traffick with the <HI>Negers</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in Hor&s;es and Camels; they receive for a Hor&s;e, 6, 8, or 10 Slaves, but for a Ca|mel only one or two, may be &s;ometimes three.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>Arguin</HI> was taken by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> from the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and taken from them again during the War in 1672. by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ducas,</HI> a Captain of the Roy|al
<PB N="35" REF="20"><HI>Affrican</HI> Company. He had but 120 Men in this Expedition, of which he lo&s;t but three. The Supine Negligence of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governor, contributed much to this ea&s;ie Conque&s;t; for there had been nothing more practicable than to have prevented it. Our Artillery con&s;i&s;ted but of 6 &s;mall Pieces, the large&s;t being only an 8 Poun|der; we had no manner of &s;helter, and above all, we were in great want of Wa|ter, it being impo&s;&s;ible to Drink of a &s;tink|ing Spring, which was the only Water our Men could come to in the whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>This Fort was re&s;erv'd to the <HI>French</HI> by the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> with all the other Places that our Company had then in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding which ac|cord, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do every year Traffick thither with &s;ome of their Ve&s;&s;els, which is a manife&s;t breach of Articles.</P>
<P>The Captain of our Ship went a&s;hore with 30 Men, in hopes of finding there the Ve&s;&s;el call'd the <HI>Town of Hamborough,</HI> but &s;he was already gone off. They met with only one Ve&s;&s;el upon the Dock, which was not quite fini&s;h'd, they &s;et her on fire, with another &s;mall Boat which had on Board &s;ome <HI>Moors,</HI> and a few <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI> who quitted her, and betook them|&s;elves
<PB N="36" REF="21">to Swimming. They found her la|den with Tortoi&s;es, which prov'd a good Booty for our Ships Crew, they at that time wanting Provi&s;ions: They are very large upon this Coa&s;t, and their number in abundance, one alone being able to &s;a|tiate 30 Men; their fle&s;h very much re|&s;embles that of Veal, and reli&s;hes full as well; their Shells are at lea&s;t 15 Foot in Circumference.</P>
<P><HI>Cape-Blanc</HI> abounds in Fi&s;h, as <HI>Guiltheads, Pargues, Vielles, Sea-Dogs,</HI> and many other who&s;e Names I am not acquainted withal. Our Seamen took great quantities with Angling, and fea&s;ted them&s;elves highly du|ring 8 Days as we Coa&s;ted along the &s;hore, till we reach'd the Mouth of the River <HI>Senegal.</HI> There are &s;ome Habita|tions of the <HI>Moors,</HI> &s;eparated from the re&s;t, upon this Coa&s;t, who, through the Baren|ne&s;s of the Soil, are forc'd to live altoge|ther upon the Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> the 7th, we continued our Cour&s;e for <HI>Goree,</HI> and pa&s;s'd in &s;ight of the River <HI>Senegal;</HI> of which I &s;hall Di&s;cour&s;e hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 19th, we made <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> being in 14 Degrees and 45 Minutes Northern Latitude.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="21">
<P>This Cape was &s;o call'd by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> who di&s;cover'd it the &s;ame Year as that of <HI>Cape-Blanc</HI> They Nam'd it <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> becau&s;e you are immediately pre|&s;ented with the Pro&s;pect of great Groves of Trees, many of which hold Green all the Year: It lyes high, and affords a mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Pro&s;pect. Above the Woods there appear two round Hills, to which they have given the Name of the <HI>Mammells,</HI> &s;ince their &s;ituation do, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;emble a Pair of Brea&s;ts. This Cape juts out a great way into the Ocean, and is e&s;teem'd the large&s;t in the whole Ocean next to that of <HI>Bonne E&s;perance.</HI></P>
<P>Its &s;ituation is wrong plac'd in our Charts, where we find it in 14 Degrees exact, though in reality it be 14 Degrees and a half. After having doubled the fir&s;t Point, for there is two, you di&s;cover a &s;mall I&s;land which is not Inhabited; 'tis call'd the <HI>I&s;land of Birds,</HI> of which, at all times, are &s;een great Flocks, it lying wholly open to view.</P>
<P>When this I&s;land is pa&s;s'd, the other Point mu&s;t be doubled ere you can make <HI>Goree,</HI> which lyes behind the Cape, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Mammells.</HI> The Coa&s;t en|clines towards the North We&s;t, and makes

<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Goree, Wedne&s;day</HI> the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> 1682. and Anchor'd in the Road, we Saluted the Fort with 7 Guns; they an&s;wer'd the Salute, Gun for Gun, the fir&s;t with Shot, out of re&s;pect to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt.</HI> When he went off in his Boat, we Saluted him with 5 Guns; all the Ships that were in the Road did the like, and when he Landed the Fort gave him &s;even.</P>
<P>After having &s;hew'd his Letters from the Company, which con&s;tituted him Di|rector, he enter'd into the Management of his Employ. He found the Affairs in a mi&s;erable Condition, by the ill Conduct of two Per&s;ons, who both pretended to the Soveraign Command: The one was a Frenchman, and Commandant for the Company at <HI>Goree;</HI> the other was their Agent-General all along the Coa&s;ts. But as the&s;e things are not to my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing farther of the&s;e Concerns.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Goree</HI> was &s;o Nam'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> becau&s;e it re&s;embles an I&s;land in <HI>Zealand</HI> of the &s;ame Appellation; 'tis about the fourth part of a League in Cir|cuit,

It has, to the South, a &s;teep Rock wa&s;h'd by the Sea, and is wholly encompa&s;s'd with Rocks, having but one narrow pa&s;&s;age by which any Ve&s;&s;els can come to.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were the fir&s;t that made any con&s;iderable Voyages along this Sea, the&s;e Parts were fir&s;t by them di&s;cover'd, as well as the remainder of <HI>Affrica</HI> in the Ocean, and <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea; and falling un|der the Power of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they Built a Fort on the weake&s;t &s;ide of the Hill for the Defence of the I&s;land, and another &s;orry Fort at the Hill foot.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>D'E&s;trees,</HI> Vice-Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of this Fort in <HI>November</HI> 1678. it being Surrendred to him by the Governour, without &s;o much as putting him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of Defence; and he not being able to &s;pare Force for Manning them, he Demoli&s;h'd both the one and the other. The Members of the Company, who are in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land, have a little repair'd the Lower Fort, having built a &s;mall Maga|zine, and a very indifferent Wall rais'd out of the Ruins of the Old Fort, which are
<PB N="40" REF="23">only capable to prevent the In&s;ults from their Neighbouring <HI>Negers.</HI></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> immediately em|ploy'd him&s;elf in facilitating the Com|merce, and in vi&s;iting the Ware-Hou&s;es along the Coa&s;ts, giving nece&s;&s;ary Orders to all the Officers that were therein In|tru&s;ted; at length he E&s;tabli&s;h'd a good Corre&s;pondence with the King of the <HI>Ne|gers,</HI> and with their Principal Chiefs.</P>
<P>Upon this Account he travers'd the Country near 24 Leagues a-cro&s;s, from the Mouth of <HI>Senegal</HI> to that of <HI>Gamby,</HI> which are the two main Currants by which the River <HI>Niger</HI> di&s;imbogues it &s;elf into the Sea. I accompanied him in all the&s;e Journeys along the Coa&s;ts, wherein I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to inform my &s;elf concerning the&s;e Countries, of the Reli|gion, Manners, and Cu&s;toms, of the <HI>Affri|cans</HI> of <HI>Cape-Verd.</HI></P>
<P>We began our Journey the 6th of <HI>Decem|ber</HI> 1682. for <HI>Senegal,</HI> whether we could have no pa&s;&s;age by Sea, by rea&s;on of a &s;trong Northernly Wind. In the mean time, the State of Affairs requiring the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> upon the Death of the Governor who came thither but &s;ome days before, he re&s;olv'd to go
<PB N="41" REF="23">by Land, and to &s;end the <HI>Renown,</HI> a Ve&s;&s;el Commanded by Captain <HI>Oyere,</HI> to carry the Merchandi&s;es, and to bring back the Goods for which he &s;hould make Ex|changes.</P>
<P>It were an ea&s;ie matter to come from <HI>Senegal</HI> to <HI>Goree,</HI> but not to go thither. This Ve&s;&s;el having had a fair Wind, was a Month a making her Pa&s;&s;age, which would be no more than 40 Leagues in a direct Cour&s;e, but full 500 the way &s;he was oblig'd to take. During this time, we began to imagine that &s;he mu&s;t be lo&s;t, when at length we &s;ee her come into the Road.</P>
<P>Our Journey by Land was not &s;o long, but much more tire&s;om, &s;ince the Road does not furni&s;h Travellers with the lea&s;t Nece&s;&s;aries. The Guides them&s;elves are in want; and throughout the whole Village of <HI>Rafis,</HI> which is but 3 Leagues di&s;tant from hence, we could meet only with one Hor&s;e for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> and &s;ix A&s;&s;es, two of which we Loaded with Provi&s;ions. Mine, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, had a very brisk Countenance, &s;he winc'd and play'd the Devil for the fir&s;t two Leagues, afterwards &s;he would &s;carce move a foot.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Negers</HI> were weary of beating her,
<PB N="42" REF="24">and, indeed, I was oblig'd to di&s;mount, but &s;he being of no large &s;ize, I got on and oft without much trouble, having no occa&s;ion for Stirrups. When I lighted upon a piece of bad way, and my Bea&s;t began to &s;tick with me, it was but &s;etting my feet to the ground, and &s;he would be per&s;waded to move from under me, and leave me fairly to get out my &s;elf; finding her &s;elf without her Burden, &s;he would kick and run after her Companions with a deal of vigour; which I perceiving, I made bold once more to be&s;tride her. But, in &s;hort, we were deceiv'd in each other; &s;he fairly &s;tood &s;till, expecting me to get off as before, and with all the Stripes I was able to give, I could only make her move a Foot-pace, as gravely as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> him&s;elf to whom &s;he belong'd. Her Back was &s;o &s;harp, that &s;he inflicted the &s;ame pain as the Wooden-Hor&s;e. In &s;hort, without any fault of my own, was I thus rack'd during the whole &s;ix days of our Journey.</P>
<P>Though it were in the Month of <HI>De|cember,</HI> yet the heat was in&s;ufferable; which added much to my grievances, we continuing our march from Sun &s;et to Sun|ri&s;ing, making only a &s;mall Halt at Noon,
<PB N="43" REF="24">where, under the &s;hade of Trees, we took &s;ome refre&s;hment out of the Provi&s;ions we brought along with us. At Night we Lodg'd in a &s;mall Village, but we found neither Victuals for our &s;elves, nor Mill for our Carriers, which is the ordinary Food of the <HI>Negers,</HI> who often, for want of Corn, live entirely upon Roots.</P>
<P>Our Landlords entertain'd us after the be&s;t manner they were able, but their ex|tream Poverty made even that mo&s;t in&s;up|portable. Their Hou&s;es are made of Straw, even that which belongs to the King him|&s;elf. There are &s;ome places, where they are made more Commodious than in others. The&s;e worthy Structures are about four paces Diameter; their Covering is round, in the &s;hape of a Dome; the up|per part whereof is Straw, and the under Palm Leaves, the whole very prettily work'd: The Dome is &s;upported with five or &s;ix forked Staves: The Wall is ei|ther with Straw or Palm-Leaves curiou&s;ly interwoven.</P>
<P>They have neither Doors nor Windows to their Hou&s;es, &s;ave only a Hole much re&s;embling the Mouth of an Oven; &s;o that whoever goes in or out, mu&s;t do it upon all four. Though the Heat mu&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="25">needs be exce&s;&s;ive in &s;uch a &s;treightned place, yet they cannot content them&s;elves without a fire, which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make an intolerable Smoak, which to them is very agreeable, they taking a particu|lar delight in Smoak. The Floor of the Hou&s;e is Sand, having Trenches digg'd in them half Leg deep.</P>
<P>Some of their Hou&s;es have their En|trance &s;o very &s;mall, that I admir'd how they could po&s;&s;ibly creep in and out. And I remember a Gentleman, of &s;omething a larger &s;ize than my &s;elf, having lain in one of the&s;e lovely Palaces, endeavouring to creep out like a Serpent, having half out he very fairly &s;tuck by the middle. In vain I endeavour'd to help him, and not daring to cut the Wall, I was oblig'd to call help to drag the Spark out.</P>
<P>Their Beds are &s;till more incommo|dious than their Hou&s;es; they are made with a parcel of Sticks as thick as a Man's Wri&s;t, plac'd two Fingers breadth a&s;under in the Nature of a Hurdle; the great knotty Sticks thus Platted, &s;eem made on purpo&s;e to break a Man's Back. Their Beds, as well as their Hou&s;es, are &s;upport|ed with forked Sticks: They lye down upon them without any more to do,
<PB N="45" REF="25">though tho&s;e of the better &s;ort of Quality have a Mat, which &s;erves in&s;tead of a Quilt.</P>
<P>By this that I have already &s;aid, 'tis ea&s;ie to conclude, that though their Coun|try can't afford its Inhabitants any great Felicities, by rea&s;on of its Sterility, yet their Lazine&s;s does much contribute to their Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>But to return to our Journey, which this digre&s;&s;ion has interrupted: After &s;ix days Travelling, we were got to a Village call'd <HI>Bieure,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Senegal.</HI> We found it to be the Cu&s;tom of the Country, for their Women only to meddle in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Traffick, their Men not concerning them&s;elves at all; &s;o that out of pretext of bringing down their Merchandi&s;e, the Women come to divert them&s;elves among&s;t our Seamen, who often are very ready to oblige them.</P>
<P>We left our Equipage here, and Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> &s;ent to the Re&s;idence, that they might &s;end him a Bark to carry us the remaining 5 Leagues, to the I&s;land <HI>St. Louis,</HI> which is made by <HI>Senegal;</HI> where we happily arriv'd on the 13th of <HI>December,</HI> two hours after Midnight.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is &s;ituated in the middle of
<PB N="46" REF="26">the River, 5 Leagues above its Mouth, and is about a League in Circumference: The Company have there a Store-Hou&s;e, a Commandant and Commi&s;&s;ioners; 'tis thither where the <HI>Negers</HI> bring their Skins, Ivory, Slaves, and &s;ometimes Amber-Gris; for our Gum-Arabick, it comes from the <HI>Moors,</HI> as I have already men|tion'd.</P>
<P>We give in Exchange, to the&s;e <HI>Negers,</HI> Linnen, Cotton, Copper, Tin, <HI>Aqua. Vitae,</HI> and &s;ome Gla&s;s-baubles. The Ad|vantages that accrues by this &s;ort of Traf|fick, is 8 Hundred for the Hundred: The Skins, the Ivory, and the Gum, are brought into <HI>France;</HI> for the Slaves, they are &s;ent to the <HI>French</HI> Plantations in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> to be employ'd in the Sugar Works.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the better &s;ort are purchas'd &s;op eight <HI>Francs</HI> each, and are re-&s;old for above a Hundred Crowns. You'll ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have a good &s;ub&s;tantial Slave for four o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> five Quarts of <HI>Aqua-Vitae.</HI> Thus their Prie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is &s;mall, but the Charges of Tran&s;portin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> amounts to &s;omething con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Senegal</HI> is a Branch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Niger,</HI> &s;eparating it &s;elf about 600 League<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> above its Entrance: This River diffu&s;es i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;elf in the Kingdom of <HI>Cantor&s;i,</HI> and from

<P><HI>Senegal</HI> &s;epanates the <HI>Azonghes, Moors</HI> or <HI>Tawnies,</HI> from the real <HI>Blacks;</HI> &s;o that on one &s;ide of the River are the <HI>Moors</HI> of a Tawny Complexion, and the other is Inhabited by People that are perfectly Black. The former are Wanderers, &s;till Encamping, and making no longer &s;tay in a place than they are furni&s;h'd with good Pa&s;turage; whereas the others, to wit, the <HI>Negers,</HI> are Sedentry, and a&s;&s;o|ciate them&s;elves in Villages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e have no. Superiors but what they voluntarily choo&s;e, but the&s;e are &s;ubjected to Kings, who De&s;potically Tyrannize over them, and render them meer Slaves and Va&s;&s;als. The <HI>Moors</HI> are &s;mall, Mea|ger, and of an uncouth Mien, but have a Genius that's free and refin'd. On the contrary, the <HI>Negers</HI> are large, fat, and well proportion'd, but very Silly, and of &s;hallow Conceptions. The Country In|habited by the <HI>Moors</HI> is a Barren Sand, de&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of Greens; and that of the <HI>Nigers</HI> fertile in Pa&s;turage, Mill, and ever Greens, though they produce no Fruit for Su&s;te|nance.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="27">
<P>It is from the&s;e <HI>Moors</HI> that we have our Gum-Arabick; they gather it in the De&s;arts of the interior <HI>Lybia.</HI> It &s;ticks to the Trees that di&s;charge it, as that of Cherry and Plum-Trees in <HI>France:</HI> They expo&s;e it to Sale a Month or &s;ix Weeks before the Inundation of <HI>Niger.</HI></P>
<P>We give them in Exchange blue Cloth, blue Linnen, and &s;ome &s;mall quantities of Iron; they bring it 5 or 600 Leagues by Land; &s;ome have half a Quintal, &s;ome more, and others le&s;s. They Ride wholly Naked upon their Camels, Hor&s;es, or Beeves, which they make u&s;e of for car|rying, their Merchandi&s;es. Tho&s;e of the greate&s;t Rank among&s;t them, have a kind of Mantle made of Furr'd Skins, which very much re&s;emble the Hoods of our Chanters; others have only a &s;orry piece of Leather to cover their Nudities. They make u&s;e of little other Nouri&s;hment but Milk, with &s;ome Gum di&s;&s;olv'd therein.</P>
<P>They are accu&s;tom'd to feed in Gangs when they come down to Traffick; and &s;ometimes they buy a Beef expre&s;ly to devour him, but mu&s;t them&s;elves out his Throat, otherwi&s;e they will not eat of him; and there are tho&s;e among&s;t, who are &s;et a part for that piece of Service
<PB N="49" REF="27">Though they have good &s;tore of Cattle, yet they rarely eat any, &s;ave only when they have &s;ome one that is ready to expire, either by &s;ome Di&s;temper, or by Age.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that Negotiate with them have an intolerable deal of trouble, &s;ince they al|ways meet with either Cheating or In&s;ult from their hands; but &s;ince the Com|merce is drove on the Bank of the River, they cannot &s;o ea&s;ily Cheat, for the Goods are immediately put on Board as they are Mea&s;ur'd from them. This Commerce is perform'd in the Months of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> 30 Leagues above our Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>When all is fini&s;h'd, they begin to Rattle you with a thou&s;and opprobrious Reproaches; and if they can Trepan any <HI>French,</HI> or other White Man, they certain|ly kill him in Revenge of &s;ome Quarrel, though of 20 Years &s;tanding. No longer than two Months &s;ince, they had taken a Seaman that knew the Language, who was &s;ent by a Captain of the Company to <HI>Arguin,</HI> and they demanded no le&s;s than 50 Slaves in Exchange of him.</P>
<P>Never was Nation more Rogui&s;h and Perfidious: They are very Cunning; and can make u&s;e of Fire Arms, but dare not &s;tand a Shot; &s;o that three White Men
<PB N="50" REF="28">did once prevent more than four hundred from &s;eizing of a Bark, with which the&s;e Infidels came to Traffick; the Musket-&s;hot which they were ply'd withal, did utterly Di&s;arm them of their Courage, and baulk their Treachery.</P>
<P>It was known afterwards, that the mo&s;t part of them were <HI>Moors</HI> from the Skirts of <HI>Mount-Atlas,</HI> who came to Depo&s;e <HI>Cheiratick,</HI> one of the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant <HI>Negers</HI> Princes of that Country; of whom I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter. I had forgot to mention that they retire into the Up|lands, as &s;oon as the <HI>Niger</HI> begins to over|flow.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Senegal</HI> is the fir&s;t Land belonging to the <HI>Negers:</HI> It has been for|merly very con&s;iderable, at pre&s;ent it is of &s;mall Note; though they have a very brave King, yet, for want of Force, this Prince is become Tributary to another.</P>
<P>His Dominion extends it &s;elf along the River for the &s;pace of 40 Leagues, with|out reckoning &s;ome petty Signiories about its Mouth, and about 10 or 12 Leagues into Land; all which are his Tributaries.</P>
<P>This King is call'd <HI>Brac,</HI> which is an Appellation of Dignity; however Ab&s;olute he is, yet is he &s;o Poor and Mi&s;erable, bib
<PB N="51" REF="28">that often he has not Mill for his own Support. He is &s;o great a Lover of Hor&s;es, that for the generality he contents him|&s;elf with a Pipe of Tobacco, and a &s;mall quantity of <HI>Aqua-Vitae,</HI> and &s;pares his Mill to give his Hor&s;es. Sometimes he makes Incur&s;ions upon the mo&s;t unprovided of his Neighbours, without the lea&s;t pretext, and &s;o drives off their Cattel, in which their Riches con&s;i&s;t; nay, often makes a parcel of Slaves, whom he &s;ells for <HI>Aqua-Vitae.</HI></P>
<P>When his Stock of Strong-Water di|mini&s;hes, he Looks up the remaining quan|tity in a &s;mall Che&s;t, and gives the Key to one of his Favourites, whom he di&s;|patches, perhaps, 30 Leagues from thence, to tell &s;ome fooli&s;h Story to his Wein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n. This he does, that he may not have pow|er to Drink during his ab&s;ence with the Key, by which means his &s;mall Store is pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If he has no opportunity of exerci&s;ing his Tyranny upon his Neighbours, he does not fall of giving his own Subjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a ta&s;te of it, by over running his own Coun|try, &s;taying two days in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> one, Village, three in another, where he exacts an En|tertainment for him&s;elf and all his Court;
<PB N="52" REF="29">which is compos'd of 200 of tho&s;e that are mo&s;t exqui&s;ite in Roguery, Ra&s;cals that have refin'd them&s;elves by the Com|merce with the Whites, of whom they are &s;ure to retain their wor&s;t qualities. After they have ruin'd the Town, they take oc|ca&s;ion to carry off &s;ome Slaves, upon the lea&s;t pretence of injury imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nable.</P>
<P>And if the Prince be Perfidious, his Subjects don't come an Inch behind him, for they will lay hold on all opportuni|ties to &s;ell each other, without the lea&s;t regard either to the degrees of Sanguini|ty; &s;o that a Father will &s;ell his Sons, and a Son his Parents, as it be&s;t happens. They will pretend to employ tho&s;e whom they have a mind to &s;ell, in helping them with their Goods to our Re&s;idence, and when they have them there, they deliver them to whoever will purcha&s;e them, if they un|der&s;tand not the Language.</P>
<P>I will in&s;ert here an Adventure that hap|pen'd &s;ome time &s;ince, which will verify what I have been &s;aying. One of the&s;e Wretches had form'd a de&s;ign of &s;elling his Son, he perceiving it di&s;&s;embled the thing, and under&s;tanding the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, whil&s;t his Father was gone &s;ome|where a&s;ide he went to our Store-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="53" REF="29">and told, That he had a Jolly Slave to di&s;po&s;e of; and, in &s;hort, the Price was agreed on, and the bargain concluded, he &s;old and deliver'd him. This Slave was his own Father, who &s;eeing them go to put Irons on his Feet, he began to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, and cry'd out, He was his Father; he deny'd it, and the Bargain &s;tood good.</P>
<P>This Crime did not go long unpuni&s;h'd, for the Son going home again with his Merchandi&s;e, met with a powerful Seig|niour, who fairly &s;tripp'd him of what he had, made him a Slave, and &s;old him at our Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>After the Kingdom of <HI>Brac,</HI> you meet with that of <HI>Cheyratick;</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, the mo&s;t potent of the Empire. Of this latter depends more than ten little Kings, and other mean Soveraigns: His Empire extends it &s;elf upon two branches of the River <HI>Senegal,</HI> and contains full 300 Leagues of Land. The&s;e Countries pro|duce Dates, Mill, and plentiful Pa&s;tures for feeding great &s;tore of Cattel. The&s;e People are call'd <HI>Foules;</HI> they are not quite black, neither &s;o white as the <HI>Moors,</HI> but are betwixt both.</P>
<P>They are far more Civiliz'd than the re&s;t of the <HI>Negers,</HI> and entertain Strangers
<PB N="54" REF="30">very civilly. It has very often happen'd, when any of our Seamen have been ill treated by their Captains, they have taken Refuge at the Court of <HI>Cheyratick,</HI> where they have been kindly receiv'd, admitted to his Table, and have partaken of all the &s;atisfaction and diver&s;ions that the place was capable of affording.</P>
<P>He, for the mo&s;t part, feeds upon Mill, Beef, and Dates, and never Drinks ei|ther Wine or <HI>Aqua-Vitae,</HI> ob&s;erving the Precepts of <HI>Mahomet</HI> more Religiou&s;ly than the other <HI>Negers;</HI> he can take the Field with 50000 men, but for want of Provi|&s;ions he cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>A&s;cending from the E&s;tates of <HI>Cheyra|tick,</HI> you meet with the Countries of <HI>Far|gots</HI> and <HI>Engusland,</HI> 300 Leagues from our Re&s;idence; we al&s;o manage a Traffick with them. They differ not in the lea&s;t from the <HI>Foules.</HI> Since it is impo&s;&s;ible to get any higher, my knowledge of tho&s;e Countries reaches no farther; nor do I know a tittle of any thing beyond.</P>
<P>After the River <HI>Senegal</HI> has winded it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf about <HI>Cantercy,</HI> and &s;everal other large I&s;lands, it empties it &s;elf into the Sea, by two &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages, in 15 Degrees 32 Mi|nutes Northern Latitude. Betwixt the Sea
<PB N="55" REF="30">and this River there lies a Flat, or Bed of Sand, of about a Cannon-&s;hot over; this re&s;i&s;tance forces it to continue its Cour&s;e for 6 Leagues before it can di&s;charge it &s;elf into the Sea, though their &s;urface lies of an equal level, but when it has forc'd it &s;elf two &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages, it di&s;embogues it &s;elf by two Mouths into the Sea, of about two Leagues di&s;tant from each other, between which is found an I&s;land.</P>
<P>In each of the&s;e Chanels there ari&s;es &s;everal Sand-Banks, which the River wa&s;hes down with it, and are ca&s;t up back again by the Sea, and are left in dangerous ridges very incommodious for the Shipping for want of open Chanels; the continual agitation of the Sea, meeting a re&s;i&s;tance by the Banks, render the Waves of a terri|ble largene&s;s, who&s;e force do often &s;plit the Ve&s;&s;els again&s;t the &s;hore; and then there is no manner of help for the Sea|men, for &s;hould they endeavour to &s;ave them&s;elves by Swimming, they would be immediately devour'd by the <HI>Requiems.</HI> The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are only dangerous at Low-Water, and not at the over-flowing of the <HI>Niger.</HI></P>
<P>What is &s;ingular in the&s;e Inundations, is that they almo&s;t, every time the Waters
<PB N="56" REF="31">ri&s;e, force them&s;elves new Pa&s;&s;ages through the Sands to get into the Sea. About 20 Years pa&s;t, it made its entrance right again&s;t the I&s;land which is Inhabited by the <HI>French,</HI> which oblig'd them to remove a little higher; which Pa&s;&s;age is now clos'd, and others made a-new, which are &s;till &s;o interchangeably fill'd, that there, however, remains but two at one time.</P>
<P>Several Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have Traffick'd formerly in this River, at pre&s;ent they are only <HI>French</HI> that u&s;e that Trade.</P>
<P>Perhaps, having often mention'd the Inundation of <HI>Niger,</HI> it may be requir'd that I &s;hould give an Account how, and at what time it increa&s;es, without pre|tending to give any Phy&s;ical Rea&s;ons for its &s;o doing; if by the Relation of the circum&s;tances &s;uch a knowledge may be forwarded, I will do my be&s;t to recount the Particulars, &s;uch as I found them.</P>
<P>The Heats are very exce&s;&s;ive under the Torrid Zone for want of Rains, which are here very rare, and never out of the Months of <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>September.</HI> On the South-&s;ide of the Equinoctial the Rains begin earlier, and e&s;pecially falls in abundance at this Sea&s;on; they are ac|company'd with furious Winds, and fol|low'd
<PB N="57" REF="31">by &s;o great a Calm, and &s;uch &s;oul tring Heats, that 'tis very trouble&s;ome to breath. After the interval of two or three hours the Tempe&s;t recommences, and holds thus &s;ucce&s;&s;ively during the three Months; this occa&s;ions violent Di&s;tempers, Fevers, <HI>Cholera-Morbus,</HI> Ulcers upon the Legs, frequent Convul&s;ions, follow'd by Death or the Pal&s;ie.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons of the Inundation of the <HI>Nile</HI> are &s;ufficiently known, nor have I any occa&s;ion to repeat them; this of the <HI>Niger</HI> is, no doubt, produc'd by the &s;ame Prin|cipals. I believe that the true cau&s;e pro|ceeds from the Sun's repa&s;&s;ing the Line of <HI>Cancer,</HI> which in <HI>France</HI> makes our Sum|mer Sol&s;tice; and here the Winter draws together a great Ma&s;s of Vapours, which are afterwards di&s;cu&s;s'd into great and continued Rains, which, con&s;equently, cau&s;e the overflowing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rains begin in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> and continue <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> but here they begin the 15th of <HI>July;</HI> they hold en|crea&s;ing for the &s;pace of 40 days, and are as long in their decrea&s;e. This Inunda|tion, which enriches the Soil, is not gene|ral, but only on the Country that borders upon the River. When you are once up,
<PB N="58" REF="32">the Cour&s;e of the River is no longer per|ceiv'd, &s;ince its Chanel has not depth enough to contain the&s;e Waters, nor pow|er to convey them &s;treight into the Sea; &s;o that they fill up all the Vallies, and lay the whole Country in a level.</P>
<P>It's dangerous Sailing during this Flood, e&s;pecially on the River <HI>Senegal,</HI> when the Chanel cannot be known; for upon the decrea&s;e of the Water the Bark may be left either upon &s;ome eminence, or in &s;ome hollow, of which it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to get her clear.</P>
<P>It is about 15 Years ago &s;ince an Acci|dent happen'd, which will confirm what I. have &s;aid. The Gentlemen of the Com|pany having a mind to take the benefit of the Flood, &s;ent &s;ome Barks to di&s;cover the Inhabitants about the place, and where the Branches of the <HI>Niger</HI> &s;eparate; they en|deavouring to Sail from the River of <HI>Senegal</HI> to that of <HI>Gamby,</HI> of who&s;e entrance the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are Ma&s;ters; and by a Fort which they there maintain, they hinder any Com|merce by others into that River. And &s;ince our People could no how make any Di&s;coveries that way, but at the time of the high Waters, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might Sail over Rocks, which at other
<PB N="59" REF="32">times &s;tood on dry ground.

Having one time lo&s;t the Chanel, their Bark, among&s;t other Mis|fortunes &s;tuck fa&s;t among&s;t the Trees; by good Luck they were not far off the Chanel, &s;o that by force and main &s;trength they got her once more afloat.</P>
<P>When Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> had di&s;patch'd his bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e Quarters, in what re|lated to the advantage of the Company, finding the <HI>Barbarre,</HI> or the Mouth of the River, in good condition to be pa&s;s'd, there being a gentle Ea&s;terly Wind, he accompli&s;h'd it in a Bark appointed for that purpo&s;e; &s;he carry'd us Aboard the Ship call'd the <HI>Ronown,</HI> who waited for us in the Road, on which we Embark'd to &s;ave a trouble&s;ome Journey by Land.</P>
<P>We weigh'd Anchor the 10th of <HI>Janua|ry</HI> 1683, and Sail'd for <HI>Goree;</HI> we Coa&s;t|ed along the &s;hore, which being adorn'd with Trees of a continual Green, afforded us a mo&s;t engaging Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>When he had vi&s;ited all the Coa&s;ts, and given his nece&s;&s;ary Orders, we return'd the lame way, which took us up eight
<PB N="60" REF="33">hole days. I have here &s;et down what Remarks I was capable of making during my &s;mall continuance there.</P>
<P>The People that Inhabit the Coa&s;ts from the Mouth of <HI>Senegal</HI> to that of <HI>Gamby,</HI> are divided into three &s;orts, The <HI>Geloffes,</HI> the <HI>Sereres,</HI> and the <HI>Barbecins;</HI> they are go|vern'd by &s;everal little Kinglings, each Ab|&s;olute in his own Territories: He of large&s;t Bounds is King <HI>Amel,</HI> Sovereign of the <HI>Geloffes.</HI> The Name <HI>Amel</HI> is not pecu|liar to this Prince, but it is a Name of Dig|nity. Since all their Governments do very much re&s;embe each other, as well in re|&s;pect of the People as the Country, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with this Example, to make you &s;en&s;ible of the others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Geloffes</HI> Inhabit beyond the Mouth of <HI>Senegal</HI> as you go South, till you come within 6 or 7 Leagues of <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> which contains, from North to South, 40 Leagues of the Maritime Coa&s;ts, and from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 100 by Land.</P>
<P>The Country of the <HI>Sereres,</HI> have for their King him whom we call <HI>Portugady,</HI> by rea&s;on of a Town that belongs to him, and bears this Name; <HI>Jain</HI> is his Name of Dignity. It contains 10 or 12 Leagues along the Coa&s;t, and extends it &s;elf almo&s;t an hundred by Land.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="33">
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Barbecins,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Jouall,</HI> (for the &s;ame rea&s;on as I have al|ledg'd of <HI>Sereres</HI>) is govern'd by King who&s;e Name I cannot call to mind; he has no larger Territories than the former, with whom he often wages War.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e three People, there are a &s;ort of <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> they are &s;o call'd, &s;ince they de&s;cended from them who fir&s;t In|habited the&s;e Coa&s;ts after their fir&s;t Di&s;co|very. The <HI>Negre&s;&s;es,</HI> whom they e&s;pous'd, brought forth the&s;e kind of Mule men, from whom there comes a Race &s;till more &s;warthy. They may al&s;o be Fugitives from <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> or from <HI>Cacheau,</HI> another Co|lony of that Nation, upon one of the Branches of the River <HI>Gamby,</HI> di&s;tant three days Journey. As they have follow'd the Religion of their Ancient Ma&s;ters, they are partly Jews, partly Catholicks; they carry a great pair of Beads about their Necks; there are none of any greater Rank than others; they are great Cheats, and very Malicious, having all the Vices of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and not one of their good Qualities.</P>
<P>All the&s;e parts in general are Sandy and Barren; the Heat is more violent in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> than it is in <HI>July</HI> or
<PB N="62" REF="34"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> It Rains in the &s;ame manner, as I have already &s;aid, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;poke of <HI>Senegal.</HI></P>
<P>The Country is well Peopled, and is very Woody. They begin at the end of <HI>June</HI> to Cultivate their Land, and Sow their Seed; &s;ome &s;mall while after the Rains have ceas'd. Their Harve&s;t falls our in <HI>September;</HI> &s;o that in three Months time they prepare their Land Sow and Gather in. This makes the Richne&s;s of the Soil apparent, which, notwith&s;tanding its Ste|rility, and their Natural Lazine&s;s, produces them great &s;tore of Grain; I mean their Mill.</P>
<P>Their way of labouring their Earth is odd and plea&s;ant: They get four or five together in the Field, which they call <HI>Cou|gan;</HI> or <HI>Courgar,</HI> and &s;o with a little round Iron Shovel, &s;omething larger than ones Hand, &s;et in a Stale of Wood, they break up the Earth, which they fling be|fore them, not entring the Swerd of the Ground above three or four &s;ingers breadth, each having a Pipe con&s;tantly in his Mouth. If they Work one hour, they'l be&s;ure to Chat two for it. When the Ground is &s;o order'd, they Sow it as they Sow Pea&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> and never take care to lay
<PB N="63" REF="34">by any Store. They are for the mo&s;t part &s;o Lazy, that they don't gather half enough to &s;erve them, living in the mean time upon a black Root, which is dry'd till it afford no manner of &s;avour; and upon another call'd <HI>Gernotte,</HI> who&s;e ta&s;te is &s;ome|thing like that of a Wall-nut. If by chance their Harve&s;t mi&s;s, and they are left de&s;titute of a Crop, they even dye of Hunger.</P>
<P>It is not five Years &s;ince the like mis|fortune happen'd to them, being &s;educ'd by the promi&s;es of a <HI>Marabon,</HI> which is the name of their Prie&s;ts: He was of the <HI>Azoaghes,</HI> or <HI>Arabs,</HI> of which I have al|ready &s;poken. Under pretence of Reli|gion, he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of all the Coun|try betwixt <HI>Cheyratick</HI> to <HI>Sereres,</HI> telling them, That he was in&s;pir'd by Heaven to revenge the Tyranny of their Kings. He promis'd Miraculous Forces to prove his Vocation; and, above all, to make their Land bring forth a plentiful and vo|luntary Harve&s;t, without giving them any trouble of be&s;towing their Labour.</P>
<P>This Promi&s;e &s;uiting well with their idle temper, tickled their Imaginations at a &s;trange rate; &s;o that almo&s;t all of them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Kingdom of <HI>Damel,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="35">e&s;pous'd the Cau&s;e of this Impo&s;tor. Their King was Depos'd, and all their Neigh|bours Pillag'd in this Revolt; they liv'd in daily expectation of this Miracle, and waited two Years looking for their Mill, but to no purpo&s;e. At length they began to Eat one another for want of Su&s;tenance, and afterwards were oblig'd to &s;urrender them&s;elves Slaves. Proce&s;s of time con|vinc'd them of their folly and madne&s;s; &s;o they drove away their Tyrant, and re|&s;tor'd <HI>Damel</HI> to his E&s;tate. At pre&s;ent they will allow no more <HI>Marabous</HI> in their Coun|try, but make Slaves of all they can lay their hands on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their Mill, they have black and white Beans, very like our <HI>French</HI> Beans, and Melons full of an in&s;ipid Juice. Of this &s;ort of Grain, they make that which they call <HI>Cou&s;cou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Laguere</HI> in their Language, which is their ordinary &s;ort of Food. The Fruit which we call <HI>Bananes,</HI> and in the <HI>Canaries Adam</HI>'s Ap|ples, are very plentiful among&s;t them. They feed Cattle and Goats; and tho&s;e among&s;t them which have the large&s;t Stock, are of the greate&s;t Repute. Their Beefs are no larger than a Calf of eight or nine Months old in <HI>France,</HI> which I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="35">is occa&s;ion'd by their great Droughts; for all along the Banks of the River <HI>Sene|gal,</HI> which affords good Pa&s;turage, they are as large as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There are great &s;tore of Palm-Trees, of which I ob&s;erv'd three &s;everal &s;orts: The one re&s;embles the Date-Tree, the other like them we have in <HI>France;</HI> the third is a &s;ort of <HI>Latanier.</HI> As for that which bears the <HI>Coco,</HI> there is none of that kind here.</P>
<P>By Inci&s;ions which the <HI>Negers</HI> make in the&s;e Palm-Trees, a Liquor is Di&s;till'd of a Pearl colour, which they call Palm-Wine, 'tis &s;weet and palatable to be made u&s;e of the fir&s;t day, it entoxicates, and lo&s;es its gu&s;t, every day growing &s;owrer than other; the older it is, the more it affects the Head. Each Tree may produce three Pints of Li|quor; it is generally made u&s;e of for the Regaling of Strangers, nor is it ever want|ing among&s;t the Per&s;ons of Condition. This &s;ame Tree produces a &s;ort of &s;mall <HI>Coco's,</HI> from which they draw the <HI>Punick</HI> Oil; which &s;mells like Violets, is of a Saffron colour, and ta&s;tes like Olives; it makes part of the Compo&s;ition of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;elin</HI>-Oil of <HI>Nicolas Alexandrin.</HI> Some Cu&s;toms from the&s;e Trees are due to <HI>Alzair,</HI> or the Lord of the Village.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="36">
<P>As the Palm-Trees are high and without Branches, and that the Inci&s;ion mu&s;t be made in two or three places below the Tuft of Boughs, which is the Beauty of this Tree, they climb up after this man|ner: They have a round Hoop made of Bark, which they can tye and untye as they plea&s;e, by which they mount; they &s;eem as if they &s;at within it, and pu&s;h their Feet again&s;t the Tree, &s;u&s;tain'd by the Rind which goes about their Thighs, and holds them as firm as though they &s;at upon the Ground. Thus they Inch up till they get to the top, where they make their Inci&s;ions, and fix too their <HI>Calaba&s;&s;es</HI> to catch the di&s;tilling Liquor. You can't look upon them &s;o high, upheld by &s;o &s;mall a matter, without being &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome dread and terror.</P>
<P>All along the Coa&s;ts they have an infi|nite number of Animals, of which I &s;han't pretend to give a particular De&s;cription, &s;ince I am not well-skill'd in the Science of the Naturali&s;ts; I &s;hall only mention them that I know, of which many may be &s;een in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Care and Curio&s;ity of &s;everal Princes that have occa&s;ion'd their Tran&s;porting: But &s;eeing them there in their Natural fiercene&s;s, before they are
<PB N="67" REF="36">any ways tam'd, what I have to &s;ay con|cerning them may, perhaps, give you &s;ome more particular Ideas.</P>
<P>The places where, for the mo&s;t part, the&s;e wild Creatures are &s;een, are Ponds and Ditches which the Rain has fill'd up; Evenings and Mornings they come thither by Droves, as well as others that be le&s;s Savage: There are then to be &s;een <HI>Ele|phants, Lions, Tygers, Leopards, Ounces, Wolves, Tyger-Cats,</HI> &s;uch as produce <HI>Civet, Foxes, Wild Goats,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What they ob&s;erve of an <HI>Elephant,</HI> is, That &s;he is never to be attack'd where there is room enough for her quick and free turning; for when &s;he is at liberty, &s;he will certainly overturn the Men with her Trunk, and trample them to Death. I do not know the time when the Female brings forth her Young, what I know, is, That &s;he often has three at a time, and feeds them with Herbs and Leaves, which &s;he puts in their Mouths with her Trunk. They often come by Night into the Villa|ges, not at all concerning them&s;elves tho' they be frequented places; and in&s;tead of turning out of the way, when they meet with any of the <HI>Negers</HI> Hou&s;es, they keep &s;treight forwards, and overturn them in
<PB N="68" REF="37">their Walk as tho' they were but Nut|&s;hells.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lyon</HI> is very curious and cunning in &s;eizing his Prey, not leaping directly upon it, but taking a compa&s;s, ramping upon the Ground, and when he finds him|&s;elf within compa&s;s, he darts forth and flings him&s;elf upon it. They are ea&s;ily tam'd when Young, we having had of them as gentle and as fawning as a Dog.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tyger</HI> is more fierce than the <HI>Lyon,</HI> his length and heighth is near the &s;ame with a Greyhounds, and will indifferently fall upon either Man or Bea&s;t. The <HI>Ne|gers</HI> kill many of them with their <HI>Zagayes,</HI> and their Arrows, that they may get their Skins; whatever Wound they have receiv'd, yet they keep upon the Defence during they have any life left, and &s;carce ever fail of killing &s;ome before they fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Leopard</HI> is cruel and nimble; how|ever, they do not care for attacking Men, unle&s;s they meet them in a place &s;o nar|row that they cannot be avoided; but then he flings him&s;elf upon them, tearing their Faces with their Claws, pulling off as much fle&s;h as they can gra&s;p, and thus killing them. They are Mortal Enemies to the Dogs, and devour them where-ever they meet them.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="37">
<P>They &s;ay the <HI>Ounce</HI> is &s;till more fierce than a <HI>Tyger,</HI> of which I believe they are a Species, or, at lea&s;t, what we call <HI>Panthers;</HI> their Skin is more beautiful than the <HI>Tygers,</HI> though they be &s;potted alike.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tyger-Cat</HI> is al&s;o &s;o call'd, by rea&s;on of his black and white &s;pots; they are &s;hap'd like our Cats, but four times as large; naturally voracious, and eats Mon|kies, Rats, and other &s;ort of Animals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wolfe</HI> differs in no re&s;pect from ours, but that they are &s;omething larger, and more cruel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cat,</HI> which produces the Civet, has the Head and Muzzel of a Fox; it is large and &s;potted like the other, and very wild. One may get Civet from them every two days; which is a &s;ort of <HI>Mu&s;co&s;ite,</HI> or thick Sweat, which is under their Breech, with|in a concavity which contains their Te&s;ti|cles.</P>

They are Stupid, and without Addre&s;s, even in Matters of the &s;malle&s;t concern: They are &s;winging Liars, but greater Thieves. They have a dexterity in nothing el&s;e but in Ly|ing, having &s;o good a knack at this bu|&s;ine&s;s, that they will Rob you before your face, without your perceiving any thing of the matter, by &s;craping away with one of their Feet what they have a mind to take, and then taking it up behind them.</P>
<P>When any of the <HI>Mountaneers,</HI> for &s;o they call them that come off from Land, come to Negotiate with us, there is no manner of Cheats but the <HI>Negers</HI> will put upon them; for under pretext of helping them to carry their Merchandi&s;e, and to be &s;erviceable to them in the nature of Interpreters, they will fairly keep half of
<PB N="80" REF="43">the value of what they receive from us, as though they had a real intere&s;t in the Goods.</P>
<P>The terror of tho&s;e Puni&s;hments which their Kings inflict on tho&s;e who Rob on Nights, and the many Per&s;ons taken in the Fact, cannot remedy this Vice that is &s;o Natural to them; notwith&s;tanding the Cha&s;ti&s;ement in this ca&s;e is &s;ufficiently rigo|rous, for on this account they are to be|come Slaves to tho&s;e whom they have Robb'd.</P>

<P>Their Manners are altogether in&s;up|portable, e&s;pecially when they believe them&s;elves to be &s;erviceable in any re&s;pect. Their Drunkenne&s;s is to an extream exce&s;s, being continually gorg'd with <HI>Aqua Vitae;</HI> their Palm Wine is not plentiful enough to be always at hand.

<P>When they believe that this happens, if it be a Woman they Dre&s;s her in the Garb of a Man, and put a <HI>Zagay</HI> into her Hand, and walk about Singing with a very mournful and deploring Voice, being per|&s;waded that by this means they &s;hall cha&s;e away the Devil with this Ceremony.

<P>During their <HI>Ramadan,</HI> which is the <HI>Ma|hometan's Lent,</HI> and which continues all the Moon of <HI>September,</HI> they perform the Ce|remony of Circumci&s;ion; they &s;tay till the Children be ten or twelve years of Age.

<P>So long as the <HI>Ramadan</HI> la&s;ts, they make their <HI>Folgar</HI> in the Night, for during the day time they do not &s;o much as eat a &s;ingle Mor&s;el, nor Drink, nay, not &s;o much as Smoak; &s;ome of them dare not Spit. As

<P>Though by the Laws of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> they are not allow'd above four Wives, never|thele&s;s they keep as many as they can main|tain. As &s;oon as they meet with a La&s;s that plea&s;es them, they demand her of her Fa|ther; if he con&s;ents to it, they agree of a Price, their Quality or their Beauty makes them in&s;i&s;t on high Terms. The Dowry con&s;i&s;ts of Bullocks, which redound to the benefit of the Father; which Dowry ne|ver exceeds five Bullocks. This Bargain being made, they Lie together without any farther Ceremony. If they warrant her a Virgin, which is a Commodity very &s;carce in that Country, they lay a white Cloth upon the Bridal Bed, which if it become Bloody, confirms their Opinion of her be|ing a Maid.</P>
<P>Afterwards they walk about the Village, carrying this Cloth in Proce&s;&s;ion, being accompany'd with &s;everal of the <HI>Cuiriotz.</HI> who Sing the Prai&s;es of the fair Lady, and their Wedding Joys If on the contrary &s;he does not prove what &s;he was engag'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be, the Father is oblig'd to take back his Daughter if the Husband requires it, and

And if &s;he be re&s;tor'd, &s;he is not at all &s;lighted upon that account, for though &s;he cannot be a Wife but to one, &s;he may be a Concubine to another; and by this the Father has always fre&s;h Markets to make. When, in long run, the Hus|band is tir'd with his Wife, he drives her away, and may quit her with the lo&s;s of what he gave in Purcha&s;e; and &s;he her &s;elf may take fair leave of her Husband, by re&s;toring to him the Bullocks again.</P>

<P>The Funerals of the Negroes are per|formed with great State and Ceremony. A <HI>Marabou</HI> wa&s;hes the Body of the Decea|&s;ed and &s;hrouds it up with the be&s;t Linnen he had during his Life: All the Relations and the Neighbours come to make their Lamentations, asking the Corps &s;everal ridiculous Que&s;tions.

<P>And &s;ince it is the Cu&s;tom to make <HI>Folgar</HI> for all tho&s;e that come to accompany the Dead; &s;ome Bullocks are killed for that purpo&s;e; Slaves are &s;old to purcha&s;e <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> with which they comfort them&s;elves.

<P>Then comes the <HI>Marabou</HI> and whi&s;pers &s;ome Words in the Ear of the deceas'd, and covers it with the Pall, and afterwards the Dome is again put on, to which they affix &s;ome Cloth, either black, red, or any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her colour &s;uitable to their Fancies.

<P>Their Children, th&ocirc; very &s;mall give them but little trouble; for they leave them naked upon the Sand, where they crawl about the whole day: Tho&s;e which cannot walk them&s;elves, they carry upon their backs, with their legs to their &s;ides, bringing their feet before them, and tying them off with a Cloath, which they fix about them.</P>
<P>Whatever work they do, they keep tho&s;e Bantlings at their backs, even when they beat their <HI>Millet,</HI> from whence comes that their Bellies are always large, and their No&s;es flat; for their Mothers in &s;looping and ri&s;ing again by jerks, brui&s;e their No&s;es again&s;t their Backs; and &s;o the&s;e Children for avoiding the blows, which however they &s;till meet withal, draw them&s;elves back, and &s;et out their Bellies, which makes them large.

<P>The Care&s;&s;es of White Men plea&s;e them wonderfully; but in the mean while, the&s;e Dames being very Mercenary, they will not grant their favours for nothing.

<P>It is not the &s;ame among&s;t them&s;elves, for &s;hould this at any time happen, they would certainly Revenge the Fact with either their Sabre or their Knife; however, their Gallantry is not limited to their Con|cubines, who&s;e fal&s;ene&s;s they will not &s;uf|fer willingly.</P>

On the&s;e occa&s;ions they always have one that plays the part of a <HI>Guiriot,</HI> rattling upon the bottom of a Kettle, or upon a Drum, to excite their Courage; as they are Naked, they have much ado to fling each other upon the Ground. When one is down, the <HI>Guiriot</HI> Sings and extols the Valour of the Conque|ror, and exhorts the re&s;t to play their Parts again&s;t the Champion, better than he that engag'd la&s;t.

The&s;e Ca|noes go with both Oars and Sails, and they often over-&s;et when the Wind is high and the Water rough, tho' they do not much matter it, being all excellent Swimmers, and never &s;ink to the bottom.

<P>Their Government is Monarchical and Hereditary, though they are not the King's Children which &s;ucceed, but his Nephews, the Sons of his Si&s;ters.

<P>When the Prince makes his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Sovereignty, every body comes to Congratulate the Felicity he has obtain'd above the re&s;t of his Brethren, for general|ly they being many, the Empire becomes always Conte&s;ted, and falls to him that has the greate&s;t Force, or the be&s;t Succe&s;s.</P>

When a great Lord, even though he be one of his Relations, has procur'd an Audience, he puts off his Frock at the entrance of the Court, being quite Naked from the Girdle upwards. When he draws near the place where the King is, he falls upon the Ground on both Knees. Then he bows down his Head, and with both Hands he often be&s;prinkles Sand upon his Head and Face, afterwards ri&s;ing up, re|peating the &s;ame Ceremony &s;till as he ad|vances from one di&s;tance to another, till he has reach'd within two Paces of the King.

<P>The Prince very &s;lighting of his Sub|jects, &s;eems not to regard what was &s;aid to him, diverting him&s;elf &s;ome other ways; however, he does not omit at the end of the Harangue to an&s;wer his Demand with an extream affected Gravity, and after|wards the Supplicant intermingles him&s;elf with the re&s;t of the Courtiers that are pay|ing their Attendance.</P>

He then makes them &s;it down by him, and asks what they have brought along with them.</P>
<P>Whereas we never have any of the&s;e Audience but when we are to interceed for &s;ome favour, or to make Complaints of his Officers, and of In&s;ults made upon &s;ome White Men, we never come empty hand|ed; our Pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;t, for the mo&s;t part in 10 or 12 Pots of Strong-Water, a little parcel of Sugar, &s;ome Birds Heads, 5 or 6 Ells of Linnen, and &s;ome pieces of Coral</P>
<P>When an Envoy has any thing about him which plea&s;es the King, as a Coat, Stockins, Shooes, Sword, or Hat, he re|quires to make Tryal of them, I and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys them on, one after another: This he did, &s;oon after we arriv'd, to an Envoy of
<PB N="110" REF="58">Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dancourt,</HI> and took from him a Brocade Wa&s;tcoat, his Stockins, Hat and Shooes, &s;o that he had return'd to us &s;tripp'd Naked, had not he, by good Chance, ta|ken another Suit with him of a le&s;&s;er value than the other.</P>
<P>As long as the Brandy Bottle la&s;ts the Prince is Drunk; thus you mu&s;t expect no An&s;wer till it be all off. When he grows Sober he gives his Audience of Congee, pre&s;enting him with two or three Slaves, which he &s;ends to have taken up in the fir&s;t Villages. Unhappy are they, who at that time fall into the hands of his Guards, for they &s;tay to make no Choice, the fir&s;t at hand &s;erves the pre&s;ent turn.</P>
<P>Whatever care is taken for carrying Provi&s;ions, when you become a Sollicitor to this Court, yet whil&s;t you are there you are ready to Dye with Hunger, &s;ince the King requires your Stock, and for his &s;hare does always eat the be&s;t half. He gives you in Recompence a quarter of a Camel, which is very cour&s;e Food, a little <HI>Cou&s;cou&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome Palm-Wine.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay in this Country, a very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ege happen'd, which will &s;ufficiently di&s;cover what powerful effects Pre&s;ents have upon the&s;e Princes, and
<PB N="111" REF="58">what &s;mall regard they have either to Ju&s;tice or Equity. Two Petty Tributary Kings to <HI>Damel</HI> had a Conte&s;t about the Succe&s;&s;ion to a &s;orry &s;ort of Sovereignty; they were Unkle and Nephew; that is, Son of the Decea&s;ed King, and they main|tain'd their Preten&s;ions by divers Argu|ments too long, and too frivolous to be here in&s;erted. They propos'd to terminate their difference either by Force, or by the King's final Judgment. This Prince ha|ving interdicted all other means, they were oblig'd to refer them&s;elves to his Deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The day being appointed in which Judgment was to be given, the two diffe|rent Parties a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves in the great &s;pace before the Palace, accompa|nied with very numerous Attendance, who form'd two Battalions di&s;tant from each other about 30 Paces; they were all Arm'd with Darts, Arrows, <HI>Zagayes,</HI> Javelins, and More&s;que Knives. The King follow'd with 600 men Accoutred with their <HI>Gris|gris,</HI> appear'd mounted upon a fine <HI>Barba|ry</HI> Hor&s;e, and &s;o plac'd him&s;elf betwixt the two Rivals.</P>
<P>Though they all &s;poke the &s;ame Lan|guage, yet they made u&s;e of Interpreters,
<PB N="112" REF="59">who repeated to the King what they had heard. The Son of the Deceas'd King fini&s;h'd his Harangue in demon&s;trating; That &s;ince God had before given tho&s;e Dominions, which were in Di&s;pute, to his Father, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity belong to him as his Right; and that thus he hop'd from His Maje&s;ty the Confirmation of the Title, which could not be Di&s;puted with|out palpable Inju&s;tice. The King having hearken'd to him very attentively, told him, with an Air full of Gravity, <HI>God gave it you, and after him I give it you again.</HI></P>
<P>Such a peremptory An&s;wer &s;oon di&s;|pers'd the Unkles Party, who fairly retir'd by him&s;elf. The <HI>Guiriots,</HI> with their In|&s;truments and their Drums, Celebrated the Prai&s;es of the Victorious, &s;aying to him, You Merit this Dignity far beyond the other, and the King has done you nothing but Ju&s;tice: You are by much the finer Man, more Rich, more Potent, and more Valiant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t this wretched Prince Dream'd of nothing but enjoying his Happine&s;s, he was wholly &s;urpriz'd the day following to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;tripp'd of this Authority, with which he was but newly Inve&s;ted; for his Unkle not mi&s;&s;ing the opportu|nity,
<PB N="113" REF="59">made the King &s;o acceptable a Pre|&s;ent, that it defac'd the remembrance of tho&s;e he had before receiv'd from the Nephew; &s;o that he, in the Morning, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him that he had Enthron'd in the Evening, and In&s;tall'd the other in his place. This Rever&s;e of Fortune &s;oon chang'd the Notes of the <HI>Guiriots,</HI> and they began to Extol him they had before De|cry'd. Such is the Perfidy of the Prince, and the In&s;tability of his Subjects.</P>
<P>To return to what concerns the King more particularly, I &s;hall tell you, That when he takes the Field, he has no occa&s;ion for Vivandiers, for he is provided for by the Women of the Villages which he pa&s;&s;es with all his Train. They &s;erve him up &s;ometimes 50 Wooden Platters full of <HI>Cou&s;cou&s;e,</HI> &s;ea&s;on'd after &s;everal ways, he re&s;erves which &s;uits be&s;t with his Palate and gives the re&s;t to his People, who are fre|quently as hungry after the Repa&s;t as be|fore.</P>
<P>They all eat very na&s;tily, lying along upon the Ground, taking it up with a full hand, making no u&s;e of either Napkins or Plates. No body eats with the King but the Grand <HI>Marabou,</HI> or one of the Lords that is mo&s;t Accompli&s;h'd; often he eats alone.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="60">
<P>He will by no means &s;uffer the <HI>Thoubabes</HI> (for thus he calls us) to &s;ee him at his Meals. I believe he conceals him&s;elf from us, becau&s;e that he imagines that our Re|pa&s;t are more decent and better than his own; and that he is a&s;ham'd of his Po|verty. Among&s;t the meaner &s;ort of Peo|ple, all of the &s;ame Family eat together; their fir&s;t Me&s;s is <HI>Cou&s;cou&s;e,</HI> when that is clear'd they fall Aboard the Fle&s;h, which they tear in pieces with their Fingers, ma|king no u&s;e of Knives; after they have gnaw'd it, they put it again into the Plat|ter for the next. They u&s;e only their Right Hand during the Meals, which they always have both at Noon and Night; the Left Hand they re&s;erve to Work withal, and on that Account they e&s;teem it an in|decency to eat with it.</P>
<P>The King has under him &s;everal Mini|&s;ters of State, who a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the Go|vernment, and in the Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice <HI>Condy,</HI> who is a Tributary Sovereign, is after the manner of our Con&s;table, and has the General Command of his Troops. The Grand <HI>Geraff</HI> is the Chief Ju&s;tice throughout all the Territories of King <HI>Da|mel;</HI> he goes his Circuits from time to time, to hear the Complaints of all People;
<PB N="115" REF="60">he generally does Ju&s;tice out of hand, and puni&s;hes a Thief with Slavery; for &s;eldom are any People of a private Condition in|flicted with the puni&s;hment of Death.</P>
<P>The Kings <HI>Alzair</HI> Exerci&s;es the &s;ame Employ as the <HI>Geraff,</HI> but his Power is more limited. He has under him <HI>Alkatys</HI> or <HI>Alkairs</HI> of Grand Villages, that are as particular Lords.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Neger</HI> is accus'd of a Crime, of which he cannot be ea&s;ily Convicted, he is oblig'd to lick a red hot Iron three &s;eve|ral times; if it burns him he is reputed Guilty, if not, he and his Accu&s;er leave the Court, and the Proce&s;s falls without Co&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Kings of the <HI>Negers</HI> go to War up|on very &s;mall pretexts. When any &s;uch happens, the <HI>Condy</HI> a&s;&s;embles all the great Lords, and the re&s;t of the Subjects, of which he compo&s;es his Cavalry, and his In|&s;antry. They &s;eldom have a body of above twelve or fifteen hundred men; &s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir War is but a &s;ort of a Skirmi&s;h. In all the Kingdom of <HI>Damel,</HI> they can &s;carce Mu&s;ter up together two hundred Hor&s;e. The Men of Quality in the Army, e&s;pe|cially the Cavalry, are Loaded with their <HI>Gris-gris,</HI> as I have already remark'd. I
<PB N="116" REF="61">believe, &s;hould they be once di&s;mounted, they would no the able to march four paces on foot.</P>
<P>The Cavalry are armed with <HI>Zagayes,</HI> which is a &s;ort of a Dart, long and large, with three or four Spears, bigger than tho&s;e of Arrows, and have &s;everal &s;mall Jags, that tears open the Wound when they draw it forth. They can ca&s;t the&s;e Javelins and <HI>Zagayes</HI> a great way, and go very rarely without them. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have a Cimeter, and a More&s;que Knife of a Cubit in length, and the breadth of two thumbs. They guard the blows with a round Buckler, made of very thick Leather; though they are thus en|cumbred, yet they have &s;till their Hands and Arms at liberty, and they can attack very &s;martly.</P>
<P>The Foot are arm'd with a Simeter, a Javelin, a Quiver &s;tock'd with Fifty or Sixty empoi&s;on'd Arrows, who&s;e Wounds are always mortal, if they are not imme|diately &s;eer'd with a hot Iron.</P>
<P>The Teeth of the Arrows produce ano|ther mi&s;erable Effect, for they can't be taken out but by another hole which mu&s;t be made by the Arrow it &s;elf.</P>
<PB N="117" REF="61">
<P>Their Bow is made of a Reed, very like that which we call a <HI>Bamboo;</HI> what they make u&s;e of for the String, is ano|ther &s;ort of Wood very curiou&s;ly fitted up. They are &s;o dextrous in &s;hooting out of Bows, that they will hit a mark of the compa&s;s of a Crown above Fifty Paces. They march without any order of Di&s;cipline, even in the Enemy's Country. The <HI>Guiriotz</HI> excite them to Combat by the &s;ound of their In&s;truments.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they are within Shot, the Infantry di&s;charge their Arrows, and the Cavalry ca&s;t their Javelins. This Di&s;|charge is follow'd with Blows of the <HI>Za|gays.</HI> They &s;pace their Enemies as much as po&s;&s;ible, that they may make the more Slaves; the Per&s;ons of Quality them|&s;elves are not exempted. As they are naked, and very dextrous, their. Wars are very Bloody. They are very hardy and had rather lo&s;e their Lives, than be guilty of the lea&s;t Cowardice. The de|&s;pight that is &s;hew'd to a, Coward, a|mong&s;t them, and the fear of lo&s;ing their Liberty, does very much augment their Bravery.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Shock being over, they be|gin a fre&s;h often for two or three days
<PB N="118" REF="62">together; afterwards they &s;end <HI>Marabou</HI> of each &s;ide to treat of Peace. When they have agreed of the Conditions, they &s;wear upon the <HI>Alcoran</HI> and by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> though they know very little of either one or the other. The Pri&s;oners of ei|ther &s;ide have no Benefit of the Peace, continuing Slaves as though the War were to be Eternal.</P>
<P>See here in &s;hort how Affairs &s;tand in this Country. Whatever I can meet withal farther, before my return into <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> I &s;hall take a ju&s;t and faithful Ac|count thereof, that I may di&s;charge my &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of what my Friends have enjoyn'd m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which was to communicate to them my O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ervations.

<HEAD>Relations of the I&s;lands and ad|jacent Places of the Rivers of <HI>Bre&s;alme, Gambie, Zame|nee, St. Domingo, Geve,</HI> and others, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of the <HI>Barbe&s;|&s;ines,</HI> who are almo&s;t all Neger <HI>Mahometans,</HI> is very &s;mall, ha|ving not above &s;ix or &s;even Leagues upon the Coa&s;t: 'Tis joyned to that of the <HI>Joloffes,</HI> beginning at a Village called <HI>Joualle,</HI> &s;ituated upon the Sea-Coa&s;ts, inhabited by &s;ome <HI>Mulatters</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> There is another &s;mall Vil|lage which they call <HI>Coringue,</HI> which is nearer to <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> and is dependant of <HI>Joualle,</HI> 'tis there they drive the greate&s;t Commerce.</P>
<P>In going up about &s;even or eight Leagues we meet with the River <HI>Bre&s;aline,</HI> who&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="64">Mouth is very large, filled with &s;and Beds, which prevents the Entrance of Conves, Shalops, or little Barques, nor do they drive any great Traffick here, this King|dom affording no manner of Varieties. However the <HI>Portuguefe</HI> do here parona&s;e both Salt and Victuals.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, two Leagues higher, is the River <HI>Gambie,</HI> which has two Pa&s;&s;ages for Ve&s;&s;els, the one to the North, and the other to the South, where Ships of Five Hundred Tun may ea&s;ily enter. You mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ound the Pa&s;&s;age with a Shalop, for fear of &s;triking upon the Sands; having entred, you meet with|al towards the North the Kingdom of <HI>Bar|ra,</HI> who&s;e King lives a quarter of a League from Sea. The People and Inhabitants are called <HI>Mandingues,</HI> for the mo&s;t part <HI>Ma|hometans.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Chiens,</HI> to which you may go dry Foot at low Sea, is right over again&s;t it in the River. The French did formerly inhabit it, but they had their Throats cut by the Negers, afterwards it was not inha|bited, being of no Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flouppes</HI> Negers, of which I &s;hall &s;peak anon, are ju&s;t in the Entrance upon the South Point.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="64">
<P>Six Leagues farther up the River to the North, is the Village call'd <HI>Albroda,</HI> where the French had formerly a Warehou&s;e, The Engli&s;h have one at a Village call'd <HI>Zeelfray,</HI> which is a League higher on the &s;ame Shoar.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a Regular Fort in the I&s;land over again&s;t it, which is not above half a quarter of a League about, built up|on a Cru&s;ty and Gravelly Rock.</P>
<P>This Fort has above Fifty Pieces of Cannon mounted, which are of no great u&s;e for want of Men to Manage them; they are forc'd to fetch all their Water and their Wood from the main Land. The&s;e are they who have the be&s;t &s;hare of all the Trade that is made up this great Ri|ver, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in Neger Slaves, Ivory and Wax. It is Navigable above Two hundred Leagues.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the River <HI>Za|menee.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE River <HI>Zamenee</HI> is Inhabited by many &s;ort of Negers, tho&s;e at its Mouth towards the North call them&s;elves <HI>Floupes,</HI> People extreamly Savage, with whom no Nation have any Commerce. They are all Pagans, having every one his God according to his particular Inclinati|ons; one wor&s;hips a Bullocks Horn, another a Bea&s;t or a Tree, to whom they Sacrifice according to their manner.</P>
<P>Their Dre&s;s is like tho&s;e of <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the River <HI>Gambie,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in a piece of Cotton Cloath, &s;triped according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, which barely covers their Pri|vities.</P>
<P>They have no Succe&s;&s;ion of Kings, the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and mo&s;t powerful among&s;t them Commands.</P>
<P>They Cultivate their Land in pretty good Order, which they &s;ow with Millet and Rice. Their Riches con&s;i&s;t in Bul|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ks, Cows and Goats, of which many
<PB N="125" REF="65">have great quantities. They po&s;&s;e&s;s from the River <HI>Gambie</HI> about 6 Leagues into the Land. Their Villages are well Peopled, di&s;tant from each other about a quarter of a League.</P>
<P>The Negers, or <HI>Flouppes,</HI> that Inhabit the Mouth of the River towards the South, are Barbarous, and very Cruel; when they can catch any white Men, they give them no manner of Quarter, and they &s;ay they eat them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all along the Coa&s;ts to the Village nam'd <HI>Boulol,</HI> which is at the Entrance of the River St. <HI>Do|mingue.</HI> This Coa&s;t is much better Peo|pled than that of <HI>Gambie.</HI> The Villages are di&s;tant from each other near two Leagues, and from the Sea about a quarter of a League.</P>
<P>About &s;even or eight Leagues farther, the Tide makes a little Brook, which goes up to the Town of <HI>Jam,</HI> where &s;everal <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> make &s;everal quantities of Wax, which they &s;ell and traffick by Land at <HI>Gambie</HI> and at <HI>Cacheaux.</HI></P>

<P>THE River of St. <HI>Domingue</HI> is &s;ituated from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; it winds above Two hundred Leagues in length; 'tis al&s;o inhabited by different &s;orts of Negers, and by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who have there &s;everal Towns.</P>
<P>At its Entrance to the North, there is a Fort belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> guarded with four Pieces of Cannon, and com|manded by a Serjeant and four Soldiers.</P>
<P>Four Leagues upwards on the &s;ame Shoar near the Village of <HI>Boulot,</HI> is the lit|tle River <HI>Linguin,</HI> which lo&s;es it &s;elf nine or ten Leagues within Land.

<P>The Village of <HI>Quongain</HI> is directly at its Entrance, where abundance of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and <HI>Gourmets</HI> inhabit, who make there great &s;tore of Wax.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="66">
<P>The River <HI>Bougind</HI> is on the &s;ame Coa&s;t, about three Leagues beyond where the Tide comes, which di&s;per&s;es it &s;elf twelve or fifteen Leagues within Land, inhabited by the &s;ame &s;ort of People, who as I have told you, traffick altogether with Wax. 'Tis the ordinary pa&s;&s;age to go from <HI>Ca|choar</HI> to <HI>Jam.</HI></P>
<P>At the Entrance of the River St. <HI>Do|mingue,</HI> on the South, is a large Wood, which they call <HI>Matteformo&s;e:</HI> 'Tis a Vil|lage inhabited by the <HI>Flouppes,</HI> more fami|liar than tho&s;e I before mentioned, with whom they traffick for Slaves and Victuals; above all they have great &s;tore of Rice.</P>
<P>Going up the River about two Leagues, you meet with a &s;mall River which is not Navigable, which &s;eparates the <HI>Flouppes</HI> from the <HI>Papels.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Papels</HI> are al&s;o Heathen Negers, all Idolaters as the former. They have a King who dwells about five or &s;ix Leagues from them. When any Con&s;iderable Per&s;on dies, they Sacrifice Bullocks, Cows, Kids, and Capons to their Gods, who are for the mo&s;t part one or more Trees, or a Bullocks Horn, or &s;uch like things.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame di&s;trict, about four Leagues higher, you meet with the Town called
<PB N="128" REF="67"><HI>Cacheau,</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who have there three Forts, the chief of which may have about ten or twelve Pieces of Cannon, and the other two, a|bout two or three each.

<P>There is in the Town a Receiver of the King's Cu&s;toms, from the Ships that come to Traffick there, who pay ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> both coming in and going out, together with a Writer, who holds the Place of both Notary and Sheriff. 'Tis the Go|vernor that renders Ju&s;tice. There is al&s;o a Parochial Church, a Curat, and a Vi&s;i|tator, who is in the nature of Vicar in <HI>France,</HI> who always makes Vi&s;itations on

<P>Leaving the River Saint <HI>Domingue,</HI> go|ing Southwards you meet with &s;everal I&s;lands. The fir&s;t is called <HI>Three I&s;lands,</HI> which effectively has that Figure, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="130" REF="68">by the <HI>Gourmets,</HI> or <HI>Negers,</HI> who have loos'd them&s;elves from the &s;lavery of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> mo&s;t of them, th&ocirc; they are Baptiz'd, have renounc'd the Catholick Faith. They Cultivate this I&s;land, which produces good &s;tore of Cotton, of which they make their Cloath. They have Ca|noes to &s;erve them in their Traffick with the Negers of the Continent. The place which they pa&s;s is called the <HI>Bot;</HI> they have a particular care in &s;uffering any Boat to approach their I&s;land.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t it is the I&s;land of <HI>Bu&s;&s;i&punc;</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Papels,</HI> who have a King not very ab&s;olute. It is &s;o low Water, that it may be pa&s;s'd by being only wet to the middle Leg.</P>
<P>It is difficult to Negotiate with them without being known, for their &s;trange mi&s;tru&s;t makes them &s;uppo&s;e that there is no &s;incerity.</P>
<P>I know that &s;everal Engli&s;h and Dutch, have been there Ma&s;&s;acred, for endea|vouring to have Commerce with them. They have great Store of Provi&s;ions, as Cattle, Poultry, Wax, Mill and Fea&s;ants, but of a very indifferent reli&s;h.</P>
<P>Their I&s;land is about ten Leagues in Circuit, and has two Ports, the one to the
<PB N="131" REF="68">Ea&s;t, which is called <HI>Old Port,</HI> the other to the South-Ea&s;t, which is called the Port of the <HI>White Stones.</HI> Right over again&s;t it, is the Village of <HI>Cazelut,</HI> and many &s;mall I&s;lands which are not inhabited. Very near it you find the I&s;land of <HI>Bi&s;&s;eaux</HI> a|bout two Leagues di&s;tant. A Ve&s;&s;el of three hundred Tun may pa&s;s betwixt them both, &s;o that the Chanel is well known. It is forty Leagues in Compa&s;s; the <HI>Papel Negers</HI> which inhabit it are altogether Heathens There are in this I&s;land nine Kings, of which one is &s;uperior to the other Eight, which properly are no more than Governors of Provinces.</P>
<P>When any of the Kings die, they take care to &s;trangle more than thirty Per&s;ons, above all the young Girls and the Slaves that have been the mo&s;t faithful to the De|cea&s;ed, whom they bury along with them. They put with him into his Tomb all his Riches, as his Gold, Silver, Amber Gris, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When they chu&s;e another 'tis after this manner, they are only the <HI>Geagres</HI> that make Preten&s;ions. which are, as I may &s;ay, the Dukes and Peers of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>They a&s;&s;emble together in a Ring, in the middle of which is the Tomb of the
<PB N="132" REF="69">decea&s;ed King, made of Reeds and very light Wood, which is &s;u&s;tain'd in the Air by &s;everal Negers, which they to&s;s up into the Air, and on whom ever it falls, they chu&s;e him for King in the Place of the Decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>They often Sacrifice to their Gods, Bul|locks, Capons and Kids.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Ports in this I&s;land, the chief of which is called Part <HI>Bi&s;&s;eaux,</HI> Ships of Sixty Guns can there ride at An|chor with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The King's Palace is di&s;tant from thence only half a League there is one Pari&s;h, and a Convent of <HI>Capuchins,</HI> &s;everal of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> are married to the <HI>Negre&s;&s;es</HI> of the Country.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal of tho&s;e Heathens Sons who have received Bapti&s;m, and embrace the Catholick Faith. The King has his Guards, his Army, and &s;everal Women kind of all Ages. He has about Fifty Ca|noes of War, which hold about thirty Men; for their Weapons, they have only a Ci|meter hanging at their Arms, and are cloath'd with only the Skin of a Kid, which hangs down behind, and is fa&s;tned up before betwixt the Legs to hide their Nudities. They go to War again&s;t the
<PB N="133" REF="69"><HI>Biaffores,</HI> who inhabited the Continent, twice or thrice each Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> did formerly build a Fort of eight Pieces of Cannon, to hinder Strangers from trading thither, but the Negers would not &s;uffer it. They always were &s;ticklers for the Freedom of their Country, which occa&s;ions a welcom to all manner of Strangers, that come to Traf|fick in their Ports, who may Negotiate in the I&s;land with all imaginable Security, without dreading any In&s;ult. When you arrive at their Port, you have not liberty to &s;et foot on Shore, till their King has kill'd a Bullock, and &s;acrificed; when he has fini&s;hed, you have liberty to di&s;em|bark.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the Port is an I&s;land call'd <HI>Sortiere,</HI> full of Trees, where the Negers make their grand Sacrifices every year, in which the King him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ts. Ve&s;&s;els Anchor there very &s;afely.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the River <HI>Geve.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE River <HI>Geve</HI> winds about &s;eventy Leagues into the Continent, lying North-Ea&s;t, South-We&s;t. All the Villages of each &s;ide, di&s;tant about a League from Sea, are inhabited with the <HI>Biaffares.</HI> At the Entrance of the River towards the North, is the Village call'd <HI>Gouffode,</HI> di|&s;tant one League from the Port. There it is where Bullocks and Poultry is to be &s;old, and they al&s;o Traffick for &s;ome Slaves and Ivory.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame River, five Leagues more upwards, is the Town of <HI>Geve,</HI> the greate&s;t part of which is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and by the <HI>Gourmetts,</HI> which is encompa&s;&s;ed with Pali&s;adoes.</P>
<P>They have one Parochial Church, one Curat, and one Captain, who has the Command, and is dependant on the Go|vernor of <HI>Cacheau.</HI> The adjacent Places are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Negers <HI>Biaffares.</HI> Mo&s;t of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have Barks in the Port, by which they Trade to <HI>Serlienne.</HI> Cocters is a Fruit which both in &s;hape and ta&s;te re&s;embles the <HI>Marons</HI> of <HI>India;</HI> there are
<PB N="135" REF="70">both white and red, of which they have great trading among&s;t them, e&s;pecially in the Countries of the <HI>Biaffares</HI> and <HI>Man|dingues:</HI> They al&s;o &s;end their Barks to the Negers upon the River <HI>Nounne</HI> for <HI>Mor&s;il</HI> and <HI>Indigo</HI> in leaf, with which they colour their Cloaths.</P>
<P>The Barks can get no higher than the River <HI>Gowe.</HI> As for their Canoes, they go up &s;everal little Rivers of &s;mall Note: You meet with &s;everal I&s;lands about the Port, e&s;pecially that of <HI>Boulam,</HI> well &s;tock'd with Trees; 'tis about &s;ix Leagues in Cir|cuit; it is ju&s;t at the Entrance of the River <HI>Riogrando,</HI> and is not at all inhabited. The other I&s;lands are of &s;o &s;mall a Con&s;equence, that I do not think it worth while to re|cite them. I will not &s;peak of <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> nor of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> nor of <HI>Senegal,</HI> &s;ince the Sieur <HI>le Maire,</HI> by the Care of Mr. <HI>Dan|court,</HI> has &s;aid more than I am capable of &s;aying.</P>
