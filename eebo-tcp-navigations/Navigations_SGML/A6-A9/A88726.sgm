<HEAD>Another bloudy Fight at Sea between the Engli&s;h and the Dutch upon the Coa&s;t of Holland: With the de&s;perate en|gagement of the Engli&s;h Redcoats; the boarding of the Flemmins; the di&s;per&s;ing of the Navy; and the re-inforcing of di|vers gallant &s;hips into their Harbors.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HIs Excellency Gen. Blake having divided the Navy into two Squa|drons, re&s;olved with the one to &s;trike &s;ayl for the North Coa&s;t, to fight &amp; attend the motion of 300 &s;ail of the Dutch, in tho&s;e parts, leaving &s;ir G. A&s;cue to com|mand the re&s;t of the &s;hiping in the Downs,
<PB N="4" REF="3">which con&s;i&s;ted of 30 gallant Men of War; Vantrump having received intelligence thereof, drew forth 40 &s;elect &amp; choice &s;hips, and on Thur&s;day about five of the clock in the morning, our Scouts made a di&s;covery of his approach neer the Channel, who giv|ing notice thereof to the Navy, great was the preparation made to receive them; and in pur&s;uance thereof, &s;ir Geo. Ay&s;cue, with the Fairfax and Tryumph, bore up to them, before the head of the Fleet, and gave them 50 Guns, but was an&s;wer'd with the like &s;a|lute from Vantrump, and Vice-admiral Witte, who upon hanging forth their blou|dy flags, was the &s;ignal for the re&s;t of their Captains to fall on; in&s;omuch, that a blou|dy fight began, and after 700 broad &s;ides exchang'd, they came to grapling, with a re|&s;olution to board each other; but it prov'd a work of extreme difficulty; for no &s;ooner had we a&s;&s;ailed each other decks, but imme|diatly the &s;mall &s;hot flew &s;o thick from the
<PB N="5" REF="3">murthering pieces, that both parties were often repelled and beaten off; and the victo|ry for a long time &s;eemed dubious, til at la&s;t &s;ir George &amp; Cap. Law&s;on with the Rain|bow and Fairfax, bore up to the head of the Vantrump, and his vice-admiral; and after &s;everal de&s;perate On&s;ets on both &s;ides, van|trump declined di&s;pute, and with much dif|ficulty hailed off; the viceadmiral was &s;unk with two more; after which, the Redcoats of Col. Goffs Regiment, that were aboard the Speaker, being engaged with four of the Hol|landers, &s;eeing no ways po&s;&s;ible to free them&s;elves, re&s;olved to purcha&s;e their liberty, with the price of their blouds, otherwi&s;e to &s;ink by their &s;ides; in or|der whereunto, they plaid their Granadoes and fire|works, which did great execution, and at la&s;t fir'd one of their &s;hips; the other three perceiving this &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, declined engagement; and &s;oon after the whole Navy began to be in a Chaos of Confu&s;i|on; for divers of the Engli&s;h Frigats bearing up clo&s;e to their great &s;hips, gave them three &s;hot for one, in which action they performed &s;ingular &s;er|vice; and among&s;t the re&s;t, the Rubey came up,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and gave them a broad &s;ide with ten Guns: the Dutch-men an&s;wer'd him with the like &s;alute: No &s;ooner had they exchanged four broad &s;ides, but im|mediatly came up the Star-Frigat, pre&s;enting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">m with &s;even broad &s;ides one after another: and com|ing to grapling, the musketiers on both &s;ides, main|tained the Di&s;pute with great gallantry and re&s;olu|tion; till at la&s;t, the Engli&s;h Red-coats, con&s;i&s;ting of Col. Ingoldsbys Regiment of Foot, plaid &s;o fa&s;t up|on them with &s;mall &s;hot and hand-granadoes, that they &s;oon cleered the Decks, fired the Mi&s;le and Main-&s;ail; and afterwards boarded two of the Hol|landers, killing 47, and &s;urprized about one hundred and twenty: Many there were that leapt out of the Port-holes into the Sea, and drowned them&s;elves, by rea&s;on that they bid defiance to the Engli&s;h, and cho&s;e rather to &s;acrifice their lives in the mercile&s;s Ocean, then yield obedience unto them. The re&s;t of the Hollanders, being eleven in number, after a &s;harp fight ran them&s;elves on ground neer Newport, and are &s;ince &s;hip-wrackt.</P>
<P>Our whole Fleet was engaged for the &s;pace of 7 hours, during which time Sir George Ay&s;cue per|formed &s;ingular &s;ervice; and at la&s;t &s;unk their Vice-Admiral, carrying 40 Guns, but not without lo&s;s; the Tryumph, Speaker, Victory, Garland, Fairfax, Ty|ger,
<PB N="7" REF="4">have been deeply engaged in the Commonwealths &s;ervice; and have deport|ed them&s;elves with &s;ingular dexterity a|gain&s;t Van-Trump, who, after a bloudy &amp; great engagement, was enforced to decline, and get off, to the protection of their Forts and Sconces; but not without great lo&s;s, for we have received adverti&s;ements, that Gen. Blake hath taken &s;even, &s;unk two, and fired three, with the lo&s;s of one &s;hip. Van|trump is preparing for another engagement and &s;hipping from &s;everal Ports and towns are coming to him: He hath al&s;o double man'd his &s;hips, both with Sea-men and Land-men, who hath taken an Oath and Prote&s;tation to live and die together, and to fight it out to the la&s;t man.</P>
<P>The General hath &s;ent for &s;ix more fire|&s;hips out of the Downs, and is re&s;olved to fire and de&s;troy the Enemy in their Har|bors.
<PB N="8" REF="5">Since which time his Excellency hath taken two Merchants &s;hips, richly laden, and two men of War; Sir George Ay&s;cue hath likewi&s;e taken &s;e|ven, &s;unk three, burned one, and di&s;per&s;ed 45; a|bout 24 took a de&s;perate Re&s;olution, and ran them|&s;elves a ground on the Coa&s;t of France, and are &s;aid to be &s;hipwrackt and &s;unk between St. Mallows, St. Quintin, and Porto Rieux, Port-Towns upon the Coa&s;t of Britaign. The rek that e&s;caped, are &s;ailed towards Cortoy and St. Valerii, in Picardy, and Caen in Normandy; but Sir George is in pur&s;uit of them with 20 &s;ail; and hath taken five gallant merchant|men.</P>
<P>We hear that there is a general Ri&s;ing from 16 to 60; and tho&s;e that do refu&s;e to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are &s;etting forth another great Fleet of 200 &s;ail, and the Zealanders have cho|&s;en a new Admiral. In our la&s;t engagement, our lo&s;s is e&s;teemed killed and wounded about 300. The E|nemies far greater.</P>
