<HEAD>A LETTER TO <HI>S</HI> C. M. <HI>a Member of Parliament,</HI> FROM AN Inhabitant of the I&s;land of BARBADOES.</HEAD>
<P>THO I have not the Honour of being per&s;onally ac|quainted with you, yet I am no Stranger to your Character: your great Capacity and fervent Zeal to advance the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> has appeared upon many &s;ea&s;onable Opportunities; and it's that which has encouraged me to make Application to you, in behalf of the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> I knew to do good to any &s;et of Peo|ple under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government is a &s;ufficient Motive to animate you, without any other Con&s;ideration: But in this Ca&s;e the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> is highly concerned, for it's well known to all People, who have made any Inquiry into the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, how bene|ficial the Sugar Colonies, and e&s;pecially <HI>Barbadoes</HI> which is
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">the Key to all the re&s;t, have been to the Kingdom of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> the great Number of Ships that have been yearly em|ployed, by which means many &s;tout Sailors have been bred; the va&s;t Export of the Manufactory, which gives Employ|ment to many Thou&s;ands of Families in this Nation that would otherwi&s;e lie idle, is an undeniable Proof of the great Advantage the Sugar Colonies are to this Nation.</P>
<P>Now Sir, that which I would offer to your Con&s;ideration, is, That this I&s;land is fallen to great Decay, and mu&s;t dwin|dle to nothing, if not prevented by the Wi&s;dom of this Government; and this will not only be de&s;tructive to the Inhabitants there, but will prove of bad Con&s;equence to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Impo&s;ition laid in the late King's time, gave the fir&s;t Stroke to that I&s;land; and &s;ince that the Soil is become &s;o poor, that it requires very great Charge and Labour to im|prove it; e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Sea&s;ons of late Years are &s;o uncertain, that there is not near one half the Su|gar made now that u&s;ed to be made 18 or 20 Years ago, and the I&s;land &s;en&s;ibly decrea&s;es yearly in that Manufacture.</P>
<P>But that which threatens <HI>Barbadoes</HI> extremely, is the Male Admini&s;tration of the Government there. The Governor of that I&s;land has the Di&s;po&s;al of all Offices both Civil and Military, a few Patent Places excepted; and even the&s;e are &s;ubjected to great unea&s;ine&s;s, if they do not com|ply with his Terms, and &s;ome of them have been rendred ineffectual, notwith&s;tanding the Grants were immediately from the King.</P>
<P>And that which is of wor&s;e Con&s;equence, the Governor is or may be either the primary or ultimate Judg in all Ca&s;es that relate either to Life or Property. He is Cap|tain General and Vice Admiral, Chancellor, chief Judg of the Court of Errors, chief Judg of the Court of Grievan|ces, and Ordinary of the I&s;land, chief Judg of the Court of Grand Se&s;&s;ions, by which means the Inhabitants find
<PB N="3" REF="2" MS="y">them&s;elves obliged to run to him with Gifts, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have Cau&s;es, or &s;u&s;pect they may have Cau&s;es depending before him; and the Governors that have been hitherto &s;ent, have chiefly aimed at making their Fortunes, &s;o that they &s;eldom refu&s;e what is given to them: and this throws the Peo|ple into endle&s;s Suits, and incourages Debtors and many ill-de&s;igning People to go to Law, expecting good Succe&s;s from the great Pre&s;ents they generally never fail to make.</P>
<P>But there is another Mi&s;chief, which is paramount to all the&s;e already named; and that is, by this great Power lod|ged in the Governor, he is enabled to influence in the choice of the A&s;&s;embly, which is the Repre&s;entatives of the Peo|ple cho&s;en two out of every Pari&s;h Annually, who in con|junction with the Governor and Council have a Power from the King to make Laws, rai&s;e Money, and the like. Now the Money Bills ari&s;e fir&s;t in this A&s;&s;embly, and if the Governor has &s;o great Power in the choice of them, then he can never fail to accompli&s;h his Ends; which plainly appears if it is con&s;idered, that in little more than three Years a late Gover|nor has had pre&s;ented by the A&s;&s;embly near ten thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>The&s;e great Gifts are &s;o far from being an Indication of the Riches of the Inhabitants, that they are rather Marks of their Slavery; and I hope no body will have the A&s;&s;urance to deny this, if it is proved, that at the &s;ame time the la&s;t 2000<HI>l.</HI> was pre&s;ented to the Governor, there was a Propo&s;iti|on to lay a Tax upon the Inhabitants to rai&s;e one thou&s;and Pounds for the Support of many poor Families, that were dying and going off the I&s;land for want of Food, this la&s;t Motion was di&s;regarded, but the Pre&s;ent to the Governor pa&s;t with very little Contradiction.</P>
<P>The King gives the Governor a very good Salary, the Perqui&s;ites of the Government are con&s;iderable, the Inha|bitants have lately found a way to bear the Charges of his living; and yet all this is not thought &s;ufficient: But the Peo|ple
<PB N="4" REF="3">mu&s;t be either cajol'd, frightned, or both, into the&s;e great annual Pre&s;ents; and at &s;uch times when the Inhabi|tants are in a &s;tarving Condition: And it is not thought e|nough to precipitate into this unparallel'd Slavery more and more every Year, but they are brought over to make Publick Ju&s;tification of their Actions, by giving Gene|ral Applau&s;es and Encomiums of their Governors, tho &s;uch be even again&s;t matter of Fact and Record, when they &s;hould be &s;pending their Time in the more nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;en|tial Affairs of the I&s;land, which are generally neglected.</P>
<P>However tho it may be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train an unthinking People from exceeding in tho&s;e annual Gifts, yet the limiting &s;o as that they may have nothing left in their Power to ob|lige a Governor may be prejudicial; but then the proper Care will be to keep them within Bounds.</P>
<P>There are many In&s;tances may be given, more than have been named, of the Corruption of Governors, which will appear if examined into; therefore I forbear to take up your Time in mentioning them here.</P>
<P>Sir, I lay the&s;e things before you, that as they are all cer|tain Truths, and upon Enquiry will be found &s;o, you will be plea&s;ed to give your helping Hand for the Removal of &s;uch Grievances, when they come to be complained of in a proper Place. For as the People in the Plantations are be|cau&s;e of the Di&s;tance and great Charge di&s;couraged from ap|pealing to the Government here; and indeed none can ap|peal for le&s;s than 500 <HI>l.</HI> So the Complaints that have been made have met with little Succe&s;s, it being &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected &s;ome Great Men here &s;hare with the Governors in their Depre|dations, that they may be the better &s;upported in their un|ju&s;t Admini&s;trations there. And it &s;eems very unaccountable that the Plantations &s;hould continue &s;o long neglected, e&s;pe|cially &s;eeing they are as it were under the Guardian&s;hip of an E&s;tabli&s;hment, the Members whereof are &s;ufficiently paid for &s;uch purpo&s;e. But I wi&s;h the que&s;tion may not be
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y">properly put whether the Honourable Members of that Body have hitherto taken care to qualify them&s;elves, to under&s;tand the Con&s;titution of the Colonies, and whether they have yet made any one Advance towards the Promotion of the Plantation-Trade, and whether the Money be&s;tow'd on them might not be better laid out on the Plantations or otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s they give better Proofs hereafter both of their Care and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It's true it may be alledged, that there will be both great Hazard and Difficulty in &s;ubverting or altering a Con&s;titution that has been of &s;o long &s;tanding in the I&s;land: And if this upon Con&s;ideration &s;hould be found &s;o, yet I hope no body will deny but that it's mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on and Ju|&s;tice, that &s;eeing &s;o great Power is lodged in Governors, that &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;ent hereafter ought to be Men of pure Hearts, clear Heads, and clean Hands, experienc'd in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and Men of Intere&s;t, who, as they'l &s;corn to pervert or delay Ju&s;tice, &s;o they will be under no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;queezing the People.</P>
<P>There is another thing that is very E&s;&s;ential to the Pre&s;er|vation of this con&s;iderable I&s;land, that I cannot omit offer|ing to your &s;erious Con&s;ideration, which is putting of it in a &s;utable Po&s;ture of Defence, if a War &s;hould break out. I do not think it convenient to &s;ay any thing here of the State of it at pre&s;ent, &s;eeing that may be ea&s;ily known when examin'd: But this I may affirm, That, morally &s;peaking, if 120000 or 140000 <HI>l.</HI> were laid out upon well-contrived For|tifications, with a few well-di&s;ciplin'd Regular Troops, no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> could have hopes to attack that I&s;land with Succe&s;s, even with a Force of 10000 men; and &s;uch a Force I hope no body will &s;uppo&s;e can be tran&s;ported &s;o many Leagues.</P>
<P>This then would not only render <HI>Barbadoes</HI> impregnable, but would be a great Security for the re&s;t of the Sugar I&s;lands, which otherwi&s;e may be in great danger; and if the Plantation.
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y">Trade &s;hould be lo&s;t, e&s;pecially if a War happens, which will &s;hut up a great deal of our other Traffick, I appeal to all thinking Men how many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships would lie by the Walls, and how many People in <HI>London,</HI> and other Cities of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> would blow their Fingers, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, for want of Imploy. It mu&s;t then be manife&s;t Imprudence not to look forward, or to run &s;uch a Ri&s;que, as for the want of laying out 140000 <HI>l.</HI> to put even this I&s;land to any hazard, which pays the Crown near 40000 <HI>l.</HI> and imports about 400000 <HI>l.</HI> into the Kingdom <HI>per Ann.</HI> which is &s;o much Trea&s;ure laid up in the Nation, unle&s;s &s;o much of it which is yearly exported in Manufactures, which is &s;till a greater Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>But if it be objected, That the Nation is at great Charge in &s;ending Ships in time of War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that the Inhabi|tants ought to be at the Expence of fortifying the Place them&s;elves: I have two very clear and plain An&s;wers ready. In the fir&s;t place, the People of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> are in no &s;ort of Capacity of rai&s;ing &s;uch a Fund as will be required for &s;uch purpo&s;e: For tho three or four Men have been fortunate in Trade and otherwi&s;e, to get indifferent good E&s;tates; yet I may affirm, That there are not twenty Men in that I&s;land worth 700 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling <HI>per Annum,</HI> of which they pay more than one third annually to the Publick, in <HI>England</HI> and in the I&s;land; and for the re&s;t, many of them do not come near the afore&s;aid Value, and others are in a very low Condition. For this is the Misfortune of a <HI>Barbadoes</HI> E&s;tate; it is &s;o &s;ub|ject to Ca&s;ualties, that one Year it may be worth 4 or 500 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and the Lo&s;s of Slaves, Fire, the Incertainty of the Sea&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will reduce it next Year to le&s;s than 200 <HI>l.</HI> The next An&s;wer is, That if the Inhabitants were capable to rai&s;e &s;uch a Fund, yet they are not under any &s;ort of Se|curity that it would be truly applied; and this Sugge&s;tion is grounded upon the following In&s;tance. Above thirty Years ago, in the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, the I&s;land of
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y"><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> by a Law there, laid an Impo&s;t of 4 &frac12; <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon all the Product of the I&s;land for and towards the de|fraying the publick Charges of the I&s;land, &s;uch as building and repairing the Fortifications, building a Pri&s;on, paying the yearly Expence of holding the Grand Se&s;&s;ions, as will appear by the Act. Now as &s;oon as this Duty was laid on, Officers were appointed by the King to collect it, and it has ever &s;ince been paid in to &s;uch Officers, and has not been applied to the U&s;es in the Act.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the Money ari&s;ing from this Duty is among&s;t the Funds that are appointed for the Civil Li&s;t by the Par|liament. But when tho&s;e Funds are examin'd, it will be found they were all rai&s;ed by Act of Parliament, this only excepted. Then the Que&s;tion naturally will be, How that Money comes there? The An&s;wer is ready: It was Money rai&s;ed by the In|habitants of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for their own U&s;e; but has been ever &s;ince it was rai&s;ed taken from them. Certainly this An&s;wer would &s;ound better in <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Language than in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that &s;ome other Fund ought to be in its place, will be found more agreeable to Ju&s;tice: For it has been always e&s;teemed in <HI>England</HI> a very great Inju&s;tice to mi&s;apply any Fund, and no doubt the &s;ame Liberty and Ju&s;tice extends it &s;elf to the Colonies. The People of the Plantations have very calmly &s;ubmitted to the Duties laid upon them by the Government here, tho they have no Re|pre&s;entatives in Parliament, which is directly again&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But when they rai&s;e Money in the Colonies for their own Defence, and for their own U&s;e; to have that tran&s;mitted from them to <HI>England,</HI> &s;eems to be very hard, and altoge|ther repugnant to the Freedom that every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is born to.</P>
<P>And as the Governour then in being, when this Duty was laid, had his own particular Ends in the fir&s;t Mi&s;application, &s;o it's to be hoped, that the Continuance of it has been chiefly
<PB N="8" REF="5" MS="y">for want of Enquiry, and that upon due Examination it will run in its proper Channel, that the People may have at lea&s;t, that Money, to put them&s;elves in &s;ome Po&s;ture of Defence which was fir&s;t rai&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; and if the Govern|ment here lay out the afore&s;aid Sum of 140000 <HI>l.</HI> it will be Money well laid out, and but refunding part of that Duty which has been paid by the Inhabitants of the Colonies in their own wrong for &s;o many Years pa&s;t, which <HI>England</HI> has no more Right to than a Stranger has to any Planter's E&s;tate there.</P>
<P>Sir, your coming in with your Intere&s;t to &s;ave a People under &s;uch Hard&s;hips, and in danger upon &s;o many Ac|counts, in which good Work all Impartial and Ju&s;t Men will join with you, will carry its Reward with it, and will be very acceptable to all good Men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e con|cerned.</P>
