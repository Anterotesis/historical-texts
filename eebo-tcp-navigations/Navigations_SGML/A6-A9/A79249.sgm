<OPENER><SALUTE>Most High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas every Age breeds &s;ome ex|orbitant &s;pirits, who turn the edge of their own &s;ufficiency, upon what|&s;oever they can devour in their am|bitious
<PB N="4" REF="3">apprehen&s;ions, &s;eeking rather a great then a good fame, and holding it the chiefe&s;t honour to be thought the wonder of their Times; which if they attain unto, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s but in the cordition of Mon&s;ters, that are generally much admired, but more abhorred. Friend&s;hip is of that nature, as it alwayes de&s;ires to be entertained with mutual good Offices: therefore we mu&s;t not &s;uffer it to grow cold (by being too long non-re&s;ident) for coldne&s;s is a degree of dead|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>They that are to make Demands or Reque&s;ts to their friends, mu&s;t regard how the &s;ame may &s;tand with the &s;afety of their friends, that their motions and reque&s;ts may &s;tand with their honour and &s;ure|ty to accord unto it. Good purpo&s;es as well in Prin|ces, as private men, have many hinderers; therefore, when the commodities, or di&s;commodities of taking or refu&s;ing are once throughly weighed, a &s;peedy re&s;olution is the be&s;t to cut off &s;uch inconveniences that delay of time commonly bringeth.</P>
<P>MY LORDS,</P>
<P>Our de&s;ire is, That all your Coun&s;els and Con|&s;ultations, may abound with abundanee of alacrity and &s;pirit, in all your procedures, which now lie flo|ting, in this juncture of time: Indeed, it is great wi&s;|dom
<PB N="5" REF="3">in Councellors of State to make ha&s;te lei&s;ure|ly: State alterations are be&s;t gradual: It is le&s;s dan|ger to anticipate occa&s;ion, then to fore &s;low it; And a practical point of policy, either in Prince or States, to prepare for war, when they propound for peace; by rea&s;on, That the be&s;t Treaty is with a drawn Sword; and the &s;afe&s;t Peace is concluded under a Buckler. In a word, Nece&s;&s;ity of fighting, doubles courage in the &s;ouldier; and an impo&s;&s;ibility of e|&s;cape adds &s;pirit to the coward: And far better it is, to build him a &s;ilver bridge to invite him to go, then Bulworks of earth to nece&s;&s;itate him to &s;tay: As for Our part, upon Our return from the Diet of the Chri&s;tian Princes, We &s;hall be willing to expo&s;e Life and Fortune with You, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of Your Rights and Title.</P>
