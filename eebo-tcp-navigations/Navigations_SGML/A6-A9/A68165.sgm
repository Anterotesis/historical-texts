<HEAD>A DISCOVRSE OF all that vvhich happened in Poictiers, of the ouerthrow of the Vi|cont <HI>de la Guierche,</HI> and all his Armie, in Februarie la&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was wel inough knowen vnto the mo&s;t part, that the towne and Ca&s;tle of Guyerche (bee|ing a pa&s;&s;age ouer the riuer of Ce|ru&s;e) dyd greatlie hinder the kinges friends, and fauor his enemies, vnder the colour of the olde Lord of the place, which had obtained of his Maie&s;tie in re&s;pect of his age, a certain a&s;&s;urance (hauing the like of the contrarie parte, by meanes of the Vicont his &s;onne, who was chiefe of Poictiers) to the end he might &s;eeme the kings friend, bee|ing indeed altogether a fauourer and vpholder of the Spaniards, as his &s;onne was.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>And &s;ince the&s;e troubles it is found that the olde Lord would not &s;uffer pa&s;&s;age to be geuen to the Kings troupes, but when the Leaguers had pa&s;&s;ed by; he would not (although he did) &s;ee them: And &s;o much yet did this contagi|on breake foorth to the harme of manie Inha|bitants of his Towne, who affected the Vicont, that they which were encountred by the kinges troupes, (information being geuen of their de|meanor) they were iudged to be of good prize, and voluntarely paid ran&s;om.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Vicont hauing intelligence of the &s;icknes of his father, had &s;educed manie per&s;ons to his parttaking, to the end to &s;urprice the place as &s;oone as occa&s;ion might bee mini|&s;tred vnto him, but was preuented by the diligence of Mon&s;ieur de Sallerin, chiefe Gouer|nor for his Maie&s;tie of the Towne and Ca&s;tle of Loches. Who hauing had intelligence of the&s;e actions, and con&s;idering likewi&s;e the enor|mitie and danger which this place might be vn|to all that Countrie, and chieflie vnto the town of Loches, which was not aboue fiue or &s;ixe miles di&s;tant from them, he iudged that it was requi&s;ite to remedie it &s;peedelie.</P>
<P>And meaning to ouer&s;lip no time, hee &s;ent on the &s;econd &s;unday of this moneth of Februa|rie, the young Prince of Campagnol to &s;urpri&s;e the &s;aid Town of Guierche, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the&s;e Captaines, <HI>Prat, Brunet, Gardellia, de l'Aage,
<PB N="3" REF="3">Beray, Orignac, Cormier,</HI> and others of the ordina|rie followers of the &s;ayd Lord of Sallerin, who executed &s;o happely the enterpri&s;e, that they tooke the &s;aid Towne on Mondaye, being the third day of Februarie, about &s;euen of the clock in the morning, by the order &amp; direction which the Lord of Sallerin had geuen. In the taking whereof, there was few &s;laine of account, but the Lorde de la Cha&s;tiere, who was &s;laine in flight, being chiefe Commaunder of the &s;aide Towne, and much affectioned vnto the Vi|cont.</P>
<P>This being done, pre&s;ently the Lorde of Campagnoll gaue aduerti&s;ement of this exploit to the Lord Sallerin Pou, that he might prouide for that which might follow: for that the ca&s;tle was not yet taken, neither had they wherewith to force them, and the old Lord of the place had aduerti&s;ed his &s;onne the Vicont, of his mi&s;hap, willing him to come to his &s;uccours. Which thing gaue apparant te&s;timonie of entercour&s;e betweene the father and the &s;onne, and that the &s;hewe which the old Lorde made, was but to keepe his goods, being in his minde and action altogether enemie to the king.</P>
<P>The Lorde of Sallerin vnder&s;tanding of the&s;e accidents, and re&s;oluing to goe thether in per&s;on, as well for that he would not leaue his Soldiers and friendes in danger, as al&s;o not to leaue &s;uch a worke vnfini&s;hed, being a thing of
<PB N="4" REF="4">great importance, to the &s;eruice of the King, &amp; benefit to al the Countrie: and hauing alreadie prepared for that enterpri&s;e, there was pre&s;ently &s;ent him by Mon&s;ieur de Vaure, brother vnto Mon&s;ieur de Montigici, thirtie light hor&s;emen, and fiftie Harquebu&s;iers on horsbacke, being guided by the Lord of Boys la Vigne, hee ad|uerti&s;ed al&s;o Captaine Coue&s;elles, Lieutenant to the Lorde of Le&s;&s;art a Cha&s;tillop, to come thether with his Garri&s;on, and the Captaine Hou&s;&s;aye, and Merey, with &s;ixtie harguebu&s;ies, on horsback.</P>
<P>In the meane time the &s;aid Lord of Salle|rin &s;ent the Captaines S. Anne, S. Michall, and Chizeaux, being of the regiment of the Lorde de Vatau, to the &s;aide Towne of Guierche, to &s;erue and ayde the &s;aid Lord of Campagnoll in the&s;e affaires, and him&s;elfe v&s;ed diligence in all other thinges which he thought conuenient for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After he had ordered the&s;e thinges before &s;poken and rehear&s;ed, he cau&s;ed two Culuerins to be prepared in readines, for to march, as hee thought, very requi&s;ite, and &s;ent to Mon&s;ieur the Mayor of Tours, praying him to &s;ende him the Captaine la Vallade, with three&s;core har|guebu&s;ies, for to &s;afeconduct the two peeces.</P>
<P>And meaning him&s;elfe to goe before, hee gaue order to receiue the &s;aid Captaine, Lorde Vallade, into Loches, and there to &s;tay vntill he
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;ent him word to the contrarie, and al&s;o to keep the companie which he brought, and expect o|ther forces from him to accompanie the &s;ayde peeces if he had time.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, the &s;aid Lord &s;ent the &s;ame day cer|taine Carts laden with powder, pikes, &s;hot, and other in&s;truments of warre, which might &s;erue for &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the next morrow which was Tue&s;daye, the &s;aid Lord of Sallerin departed from Loches, with the Lord Bois la Vigne, the Lords; gouer|nors of Pretay de Marernes, Ca&s;tram la Bigeay, les Moulins, and le Puy Becheron, being all of them Gentlemen bordering neere Loches, and which had the daie before vowed to aide and a&s;&s;i&s;te him: and making in all fiftie hor&s;e, they came about fiue of the clock that euening vnto Guierche. Where pre&s;ently hee was certified, that the Vicont of Guierche was comming the|ther with two hundred Hor&s;emen, and two hundred Harguebu&s;iers on hor&s;sback, two hun|dred Spani&s;he Footemen, and two hundred Frenchmen, bringing with them one peece of campane ordinance.</P>
<P>Vppon which newes, the Lorde of Sallerin &s;ent to Mon&s;ieur d'Abain, Gouernour of the high and lowe Marches, (who was then not far off vpon other occa&s;ions) de&s;iring to ayde him with his forces, which he pre&s;ently graunted to, and hauing the Lord Baron d'Abain his &s;on
<PB N="6" REF="5">with him, hee went to ioyne in companie with the &s;aid Lord Sallerin, in Guierche, with thirtie good hor&s;e, and an hundred harguebu&s;iers on hor&s;eback, who re&s;olued fir&s;t to goe and &s;ee the three troupes of the Regiment of Vatan, which were lodged in the Suburbes, neere the Bridge of Guierche, and to knowe particularlie what want of munition for warre they were in, for their defence, geuing them to vnder&s;tande of the re&s;olute attempt which the night following he meant to make to them of the Ca&s;tle, by a&s;|&s;aulting of them: Fore&s;eeing that if the Vicont came before hee did a&s;&s;ault, it might make the thing more hard vnto him.</P>
<P>He al&s;o willed the Gentlemen which were within, to deliuer vp the place, otherwi&s;e hee would burne their hou&s;es which were neer vn|to Guien, and puni&s;h them rigorou&s;lie when he had taken the place, whereof he hoped verie &s;hortly to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. To which commaunde|ment they in the end con&s;ented, for the cau&s;es aboue&s;aid, and yeelded the Ca&s;tle the fifte daie of Februarie, three houres within the euening, which was contrarie to the old mans will.</P>
<P>Which Ca&s;tle the Lord Campagnoll did take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of with twentie Soldiers onelie, which thing fell out happilie, for that the Vi|cont arriued that day following about three of the clock, with all his troupes, meaning indeede to be&s;iege the Towne and Ca&s;tle, with tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="5">which were before be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>The Vicont with his forces made an a&s;|&s;ault vnto the Suburbes neere adioyning to the bridge, which was the quarter defended by the three Companies before named, and forced them to retire, but they recouering the forces, droue him back againe, and for|ced him to departe, hauing fir&s;t had intelli|gence of the yeelding of the Ca&s;tle, and re|&s;olued to pa&s;&s;e the riuer of the Ile, where he had a hou&s;e at commandement, very neere the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The day being come, the Lord de Salle|rin, with the Lorde d'Abain, re&s;oluing to prouide for the garde of that place, wente with foure&s;core good hor&s;emen, and two hundred Harguebu&s;ies on hor&s;eback, to the intent to doe all the honour to the Vicont, in conducting him to the gates of Poictiers, and to recompence him (if it might be) by the way, for the great paines hee had taken.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he followed them euen to the Sub|urbs of the ca&s;tle of Vieux, being di&s;taunt from Guierche three leagues, he encoun|tred one of their companies of Harguebu|&s;ies, which went to refre&s;h them&s;elues, the which he quickly put to flight without anie great re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Lords, to follow their fir&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="6">re&s;olution, hauing fir&s;t di&s;couered tho&s;e which did retire. At the la&s;t then they pur|&s;ued them with their light hor&s;emen, being led by the Lord Baron de Abain, and Bors la Vigne, which &s;ought all meanes to know their enemies forces, to take their aduaun|tage in the battaile, to which they were &s;o lately bent. But being hindered by the of|ten skirmiges they had with them, as they followed, and the place where the Vicount was, vnknowen vnto them, the Lordes de Sallerin, and d'Abain, re&s;olued to march to the right &s;ide of the Tower de Oyzay, being a verie high place, where they might be&s;te de&s;crie their enemies forces, whereof as yet they were vncertaine.</P>
<P>And in the meane time the Lord Preaux, (who as he had heard was his great friend, and was comming along the Riuer of Vien|na, with one hundred and fiftie, or two hun|dred footmen, and fortie hor&s;men, being as well of the high tower, as of the garri&s;on) might ioyne with him in the plain neere the riuer by them. The Lord de Sallerin leauing his companie, went to find the L. d'Abain, &amp; Bois la Vigne, who were gone with 12. or 15. hor&s;e, to de&s;crie the order and force of the enemies, which they did &s;o effectually, as it came to &s;uch euent as they looked for, and
<PB N="9" REF="6">therfore with all their force marched foorth to finde out the L. de Abain, &amp; Preaux; who abode about 100. paces from the~, expecting the battel, which to begin, they &s;ent 20. hor&s;|men, &amp; 50. hargueb. guided by L. Sallerin. The L. des Preux aduanced foorth his foot|men, backt with his caualleri, who went va|liantly to a&s;&s;aile the infantry of the enemie, lodged by the enemie for mo&s;t aduantage.</P>
<P>This troupe receiued many canon &s;hotte from the ca&s;tle of the Ile, and the harguebu|&s;iers of the &s;hot of the enemies, and of tho&s;e which lay in couert, did execute very braue exploites of armes, the French &amp; Spaniards fighting valiantly hand to hand: but at la&s;t, by the braue re&s;olution of M. de Preux, the Lords d'Gardeuil, Me&s;ignac, Barredon, de Vaure, la Bruere, and de Cruere, who with their troupes behaued them &s;o valyantlie, that they took the ditches, gained the moun+tain and the medow, and the &s;paniards halfe ouercome, retired to their main battell, be|ing pur&s;ued very clo&s;ely. L. Baron d'Abain, and de la Vigne, hauing <HI>vlerque la Cauallerie,</HI> the whole companie were put to flight, and vanqui&s;hed more by &s;ight of our courage, then by our force, where in the flight was made a great &s;laughter of the enemies, who were &s;o liuely folowed, and hardly pur&s;ued,
<PB N="10" REF="7">and &s;eeing the pa&s;&s;age on that &s;ide of Chau|uigni, in the height of the riuer, to be kept with the troupes of the Lorde Abain, and Sallerin, and that they could not e&s;cape the edge of the &s;word, they ca&s;t them&s;elues into the Riuer, where all that did &s;o, were imme|diately drowned.</P>
<P>The Vicont him&s;elfe, hoping of better fortune then the others, had (with many of the principall Leaguers) put them&s;elues in|to a great Boat, and a&s;&s;aied to pa&s;&s;e, but the Harguebu&s;hers with their &s;hotte, made &s;uch a bramblement within their boat, as al&s;o, that many of tho&s;e which were in the water did catch holde of the boat, thereby to &s;aue them&s;elues, &s;o that the &s;trength and weight of them did oue-turne the boate the vp&s;ide downe.</P>
<P>A woonderfull thing then was it to be|holde this &s;pectacle, which re&s;embled a pat|terne of the deluge, and to heare the horri|ble cries of men, and hor&s;es. The riuer bee|ing couered with hats, and clokes, and men, and hor&s;es, drowned, and halfe drowned, which had &s;unke, and diued vp againe. Of &s;ome their heads appeared, of others their legs and armes, the mo&s;t of them armed and booted.</P>
<P>Which dreadfull thing doeth &s;hewe
<PB N="11" REF="7">the iu&s;t iudgement of God vpon the&s;e mi&s;e|rable Leaguers, who hauing made &s;uch ru|ine of good men, receiued from God the guerdon of their periurie, and the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment which they had merited, and iu&s;tly de&s;erued.</P>
<P>The Vicont him&s;elfe being knowen, of one of his owne friends was taken pri&s;oner, who tooke him out of the water, and carri|ed him on a mare vnto the fore&s;aid Cha&s;tel|leraut.</P>
<P>In this ouerthrowe the &s;ixte of February there were &s;laine and drowned more then fiue hundred men. Among&s;t the which, at the lea&s;t were foure&s;core Gentlemen and Captnes, and by report of the Trumpetter, the pe&s;aunts and women which came from Poictiers to &s;earch the dead, did finde, that of eight hundred men which wente from thence, there returned but fiftie, the re&s;t be|ing dead, or taken.</P>
<P>This worke of God is admirable, and not to be pray&s;ed &s;ufficiently, that the ene|mies had three for one, and yet we had not one man either &s;laine, or wounded vnto the death: only foure or fiue Souldiers are light|ly hurt, and tho&s;e that are mo&s;t dangerou&s;|lie wounded, may be healed in twelue dais, and of ours were three hor&s;e &s;laine.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P>The night drawing on, and waxing ex|ceeding darke, and the want of Boates was the cau&s;e that they were forced to geue o|uer, and could not followe the victorie: on that &s;ide the riuer which wee pa&s;&s;ed before the conflict, &s;o that the &s;aid Lord de Abain and de Sallerin, lodged in the Villages that were neere at hand, and bordering vppon Guierche, and the &s;ayd Lord des Preux re|turned to Chattelleraut.</P>
<P>Vppon the Friday next following, the &s;aid Lord de Preux &s;ent to &s;ummon the ca|&s;tle of the Ile, to which place the Vicount had withdrawen his Cannon, and the be&s;t part of his carriage. Which Ca&s;tle did im|mediatly yeelde at the fir&s;t &s;ummon to cap|taine l'E&s;pinette, and the &s;poile was &s;ent to Chattelleraut.</P>
<P>On Saterday the eight day of Februa|rie, in the euening, and on Sundaye mor|ning, they drew out of the water more then two hundred and fiftie drowned carca&s;&s;es, and among&s;t others was the Lorde de Bon|nes, de Perigueux, Liutenant to the Vicont, and the Lord de Grandmont his nephewe, de Palu&s;tre, Chanboneau, and diuers others which were not knowen. And diuers others very &s;umptuou&s;lie apparrelled, and richlie armed, which they could not know. Be|&s;ides,
<PB N="13" REF="8">dailie there are found more dead car|ca&s;es in the &s;aid riuer, as if the &s;pring there|of &s;hould &s;eeme vnable to be drawen drie, but &s;till to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>This ouerthrowe which happened on Thur&s;day, being the &s;ixt day of Februarie, at foure of the clocke in the afternoone, or thereaboutes, is one of the mo&s;t notable&s;t things that euer happened in tho&s;e Coun|tries, &s;ince the&s;e la&s;t cruell warres, which manife&s;teth the great mercie of almightie God, in ble&s;&s;ing and pre&s;eruing the affaires of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King in the&s;e partes: for that therein was &s;laine, and taken pri&s;o|ners, the mo&s;t part of the chiefe Leaguers of Poictou, Lyma&s;in, and Perigot.</P>
<P>Who&s;e names, for the better &s;atisfiing of all &s;uch as are de&s;irous to bee acquainted with this ouerthrowe, are here &s;et downe, as well tho&s;e which were &s;laine, as tho&s;e which were taken pri&s;oners, to the great en|couragement of all the true &s;ubiectes of that valiant French king: and the di&s;maying of the &s;worne &s;eruants of that wicked mon&s;ter of Rome, and his adherents, whom God at his good plea&s;ure will ouerthrow and con|found for euer.</P>
