<P>_THe States Generall of the United Provinces, (notwith&s;tanding ma|ny Arts and means u&s;ed to per|&s;wade the contrary) having pre|pared for Her Maje&s;ties Service nine Men of Warr, with five le&s;&s;er Ships for the Baggage: Her Maje&s;ty on Thur&s;day, <HI>January</HI> the 19, 1642, in the Afternoone, at <HI>Sciveling,</HI> two Miles from the <HI>Hague,</HI> im|barked in a more threatning, then promi|&s;ing
<PB N="4" REF="4"> Weather. The Wind then was &s;o &s;lack, that it made little further way that Night, then to carry the Ships out of tho&s;e peril|lous Shoares; where, had a Storme ri&s;en, they had been in very great danger. The next day, when God had ble&s;&s;ed us with Sea-roome enough, the Wind began to ri&s;e very high, and about midnight, blew a fear|full and furious Storme; which, with the in|termi&s;&s;ions of &s;ome howres, (one day onely) Tue&s;day, excepted, for &s;ix dayes together continued very vehement and terrible. And by rea&s;on of the often Variation of the winds, made a mo&s;t raging Sea, and &s;o very tempe&s;tuous, that the Ship was many times let to drive, and hull it at Sea, not being able to make any Saile with &s;afety, having been in great danger to be under&s;et, by the &s;uddaine gu&s;ts and bla&s;ts, which duck't and drowned the &s;ailes in the Seas. In this &s;ad and un&s;afe condition, did we live out all tho&s;e dayes, being to&s;&s;ed and driven to and fro on the <HI>Doggar Sands,</HI> threatning to be our graves; in which we had &s;urely been buried, if the care of Heaven had not more mercifully come in to our help.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Her Maje&s;ty &s;aw and &s;uffer'd all this &s;o long with a Princely Patience and Courage, and then perceiving how little She did ad|vance in Her way to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> took a Re&s;o|lution (there being no Engli&s;h Port el&s;e neer where She might &s;afely adventure Her Per|&s;on) rather to return for <HI>Holland,</HI> then to tug on and work out Her Way with contrary Winds and Weathers, in &s;uch enraged Seas. It was pre&s;ented and pre&s;&s;ed to Her Maje|&s;ty, That if any &s;torme &s;hould ari&s;e and meet Her in that Shoare, the danger would be greater then in the open Seas where She was; Her Ship being tydie and good, The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sir Martin Van Tromp.</NOTE> Admirall mo&s;t skilfull and carefull of his Royall Charge, and the Ma&s;ters and Mari|ners an&s;werably able and willing, to doe their be&s;t &s;eruice.</P>
<P>But Her Maje&s;ty kept &s;till her re&s;olution to returne. Whereupon, the Thur&s;day Sennight after Shee imbarked, we made our Cour&s;e for <HI>Holland</HI> again, and the next Day came on the Coa&s;t before <HI>Sciveling;</HI> God ble&s;&s;ing Her with the freedom from a Tempe&s;t in that place of perill, where foure Ships had been wrack't, of which we &s;aw

<P>On Saturday (the next Day after) the re&s;t who came in the three Ships with Her Maje&s;ty (for but three came) landed all in &s;afety. What was become of the other ele|ven, was not then known; but after it was. That two mi&s;&s;ing or mi&s;taking the Admi|ralls warning, went on to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> the pro|pounded Port; The others, with &s;ome leaks, and wounds, and lo&s;&s;es of Ma&s;ts, and &s;ailes, and tacklings, came in after us, or got &s;afe to other Shoares. But the two Ships wherein the Hor&s;es were, one of them was runne on ground, all the Men and &s;ome Hor&s;es being &s;aved, onely, that, wherein the Coachmen were, is not yet heard of; and therefore fear|ed, to be utterly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>All they in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were in great anxietie and fear for the Queen at Sea, (not having ever known a greater &s;torm by Land) were very jocund and joyfull, to hear and &s;ee, Her &s;afety.</P>
<P>Some &s;aid, Her Maje&s;ty would never have
<PB N="8" REF="6"> adventured Her Self to Sea in &s;uch a Wea|ther, but to &s;hew, That a Queen feared not to be drowned. Others thought, that &s;ome Witches were made u&s;e of, to rai&s;e tho&s;e Winds. But all &s;aw, That if any &s;uch villany came from Hell, it was curb'd by Heaven, in the mercifull pre&s;ervation of the Queen; and that, When God will help, the Divell cannot hurt us.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty was entertained at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> all the time of her la&s;t &s;tay, which was from Fryday, <HI>January</HI> 27. to <HI>February</HI> the 13.</P>
<P>And then 7. greater Ships being got ready for Her Maje&s;ty, and five le&s;&s;er for the Bag|gage, with one of Her own, bought before, and now laden with Ammunition (thirteen in all:) On Munday afternoon, She went to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">iveling,</HI> and in that poore Fi&s;her-Towne lodged three Nights, upon an unexpected occa&s;ion. For Her Ammunition-&s;hip in the River of the <HI>Maze,</HI> was watched by two Parliament &s;hips, (as they call them) the <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Greyhound;</HI>) who gave out that they would take that Ship, or fire it, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">redge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ink it; or &s;ink with it. Her Maje&s;ty knowing
<PB N="9" REF="6"> how much the Kings Service, and his good Subjects and Souldiers in the North were concerned in it, re&s;olved not to goe without it, but to &s;tay there till Shee had it.</P>
<P>The Admirall hereupon having this War|rant from the States Generall, and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> went with two Men of Warre to fetch it off, and was bringing it a|way; But was met, and bourded, and charged by the States of <HI>Holland</HI> (the Provincials as they call them) to have that Ship &s;earched for Arms, and not to carry it further, but the Arms to be taken out, or kept &s;afe in &s;ome other place fitting for it. The Admiral upon this Arre&s;t, &s;topt, and ca&s;t Anchor; and came to acquaint the <HI>States</HI> General, and the Prince, with what was done, and to doe fur|ther, as it &s;hould be directed.</P>
<P>Now began all Eyes to &s;ee that good Pro|vidence, which guided the Queen to return to <HI>Holland;</HI> that Ship of Arms having been ab&s;olutely lo&s;t by Her ab&s;ence; which was &s;o hardly redeemed and pre&s;erved by Her Royall Pre&s;ence, and Courage.</P>
<P>And by that it was. For the Queen, toucht with the &s;en&s;e of &s;o vi&s;ible an Indig|nity,
<PB N="10" REF="7"> by the hands of Sir <HI>William Bo&s;well,</HI> re&s;i|dent in <HI>Holland</HI> for His Maje&s;tie, &s;ent to the States Generall a round and quick Let|ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Her Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ties Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rin|ted after the Relation.</NOTE> of the deep re&s;entment, which She ju&s;t|ly had of that great affront then done Her; and that the bands of Amity betwixt the King and them, mu&s;t needs be di&s;&s;olved, if that were done and endured.</P>
<P>This begat a Meeting of all the States, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being with them, who&s;e &s;pirit, this affront had moved much.</P>
<P>In it, the matter was argued with the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> who made the &s;tay. The Arre&s;t by many condemned, and concluded by all, that the &s;hip of Arms &s;hould come away with the re&s;t to the Queen; and the Admiralls Commi&s;&s;ion enlarged, to fight with any, that &s;hould attempt to hinder it, or any with the Queen be&s;ides it. The States of <HI>Holland</HI> now &s;aying, they tooke the &s;hip of Arms till then for a private mans, and not the Kings, for which cau&s;e (or co|lour) they before had &s;tayed it.</P>
<P>The Admirall (thus arm'd) went to fetch it away; and after &s;ome expo&s;tulations by Letters with the two Parliament &s;hips, and
<PB N="11" REF="7"> the Me&s;&s;enger, their Mini&s;ters vaine per&s;wa|&s;ions to the contrary; bid them, to lye &s;till, till the &s;hip was gone, or to keep off out of Cannon-&s;hot, or he would &s;hoot at them. The &s;hip being got out to Sea, the <HI>Providence</HI> made three &s;hots at it, none hitting it: upon this, the Admirall &s;hot at them, who in &s;tead of an&s;wering him, &s;hot off a Peece on the other &s;ide from him, and &s;o went their way. So on <HI>February</HI> &s;ixteenth, being <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> that &s;hip with the re&s;t came to <HI>Sciveling</HI> to the Queen.</P>
<P>THat Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queens &s;econd com|ming out of <HI>Holland</HI> with a Navy of <HI>13</HI> Ships <HI>Feb. 16. 1642</HI></NOTE> Her Maje&s;ty imbarked again in the Prince&s;&s;e Royall of great <HI>Brittaine</HI> (Her fir&s;t &s;hip.) And with a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Weather, on a quiet Sea, by a &s;oft and gen|tle Gale, was brought on Sunday after, within &s;ight of <HI>Flamborough-head.</HI> The Heavens and Winds for &s;o long a time (and many Dayes before) continuing in tho&s;e Winter Dayes and Northren Seas, almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly Faire, and Intempe|&s;tuous.</P>
<P>On Munday we got on as farr as <HI>Scar|borough;</HI> But then the Wind blew from
<PB N="12" REF="8"> <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> our onely intended Haven, ju&s;t in our Teeth; and as God in great Mercy would have it, &s;aid to us (in the Language of His Providence) <HI>Goe no further.</HI> So we fell back into a &s;afe Harbour <HI>(Burlington-Bay)</HI> and ca&s;t Anchor hard by the Shoare. As Her Maje&s;ty rid at Anchor there, &s;ome of the Gentry and Country People &s;ent, and came, to pre&s;ent to the Queen &s;ome of their Country Provi&s;ions, with their Joyes for Her Safety and happy Returne. Her Ma|je&s;ty graciou&s;ly accepted them, doing them the Honour to let them ki&s;&s;e Her Hand.</P>
<P>Here God put into Her Heart another ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;olution. It was to &s;end to my Lord of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to give him word of Her being there, and Her will (if he &s;o direct) there to land. His Excellency having but the Weeke before, beaten the Forces out of <HI>Stamford</HI> Bridge, and made his way into the Ea&s;t-Ry|ding of <HI>Yorke&s;hire,</HI> was then very happily at <HI>Pocklington</HI> with his Army, about twenty miles from <HI>Burlington.</HI> On Tue&s;day came a Me&s;&s;enger with Tydings, That the Ge|nerall of the Hor&s;e, next Day about Noon, would waite on Her Maje&s;ty at &s;hoare
<PB N="13" REF="8"> with a thou&s;and Hor&s;e: And my Lord Ge|derall the next Day after, with the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e and Foote Army. This was done accordingly. For on Wedne&s;day after Noone, the Hor&s;e appeared on the &s;hoare; whereupon, Her Maje&s;ty landed that Night at <HI>Burlington-Key.</HI> All the Ordinance of the Ships &s;peaking as much to tho&s;e who were not near enough to &s;ee it. Next Day (as the Queen was at Dinner) came His Excellency, and Generall King, with the Army of Foot, and fiveteen hundred more Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>His Excellency tould the Queen, Her landing &s;o, was in a mo&s;t happy place and time, for the Country and Army, and Her &s;elfe and Her Retinue. So apparently it was. For be&s;ides the great moiling of Men and Bea&s;ts, this would &s;ave the Country a very va&s;t expence of Moneys for Carri|ages in tho&s;e long and ill wayes from <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> to <HI>Yorke,</HI> this being but thirty miles and good way from it. And the Army (al|ready much wearied, in cha&s;es of the Ene|my, from which they came but the Day be|fore) would have been overtoyled and
<PB N="14" REF="9"> weakened in &s;o long Convoyes and March|es to and fro, for the Queens nece&s;&s;ary con|duct and Attendance; of which great trou|ble, Her Maje&s;ty now gave them a pre&s;ent ca&s;e. And both Country and Army mag|nified the mercyfull Providence of God to both, who di&s;po&s;ed &s;o of his Winds, and the Queens thoughts; to bring them &s;uch an unexpected ca&s;e and happine&s;&s;e, to the great joy and encouragement of them all. And Her Maje&s;ty &amp; Retinue had their &s;hare in the happine&s;&s;e, too. For by this meanes, the Queen came much &s;ooner to <HI>York</HI> now, then &s;he could, had &s;he landed at Her fir&s;t comming at <HI>Newca&s;tle:</HI> And much &s;afer too, then if &s;he had now arrived there; con|&s;idering the Dangers both of the Haven, and &s;hips, which lay in waite for Her there, fit|ted with Men of de&s;perate minds, to doe all po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;chief; and the many Ac|cidents and Perills, which might have be|fallen Her in comming thence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, great advantage would have been nece&s;&s;arily given, and as greedi|ly taked from the Diver&s;ion and Divi&s;ion of the Army, to make the Enemy more
<PB N="15" REF="9"> bould and bu&s;ie to work his ends, by the ab|&s;ence, now fru&s;trated by the keeping of it in one body and place.</P>
<P>The Army being now by <HI>Burlington,</HI> the Queen after Dinner rid out in a Coach to &s;ee it; which received great encouragement from Her comming, and welcommed Her in|to the field, with many hearty Acclamations and expre&s;&s;ions of their Joyes, &s;uch, as much moved many to &s;ee them; and in them the true old Genius and Spirit of the Engli&s;h Nation to their Princes, of late degenerated into the &s;trange Tongue of rude Invectives and Outcryes. After &s;ight of the Army, which Her Maje&s;ty rid through &amp; through, even to the new rai&s;ed and unarmed Com|panies; Shee returned to Her Lodging at <HI>Burlington Key.</HI></P>
<P>But had another manner of Salutation &s;ent Her from the Sea next Morning, in a &s;trange (and till that time) utterly un|known and unparallelly-barbarous Lan|guage.

One of tho&s;e Ships was directly planted again&s;t the Hou&s;e where the Queen lay; and that, and the other made many &s;hots over it, and on every &s;ide about it. Her Ma|je&s;ty hereupon was &s;uddainly called up out of Her Bed to avoid the Danger, and lea|ving the Hou&s;e, went and &s;at down under the Brow of an Hill, which &s;ecured Her from the &s;hot.</P>
<P>The Lords and Ladyes (who were all thereabouts lodged) made ha&s;t to goe with, and after the Queen; &s;ome of their Hou&s;es having been &s;hot through before; and the Bullets, then flying about them in the Streets and Fields as they went. And as they &s;ate under the Hill, &s;ome flew over their heads, ca&s;ting &s;ome rubbage and du&s;t, though no Danger then upon them: &s;o that of all the Queenes Company (God be thanked) not one was kil'd, or hurt, or touched; though one of the common Soul|diers was &s;ore torn, and a Serjeant &s;laine
<PB N="17" REF="10"> out right, not farr from the Queenes Lodg|ing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ships, (upon Adverti&s;ement brought them of the Queenes comming) were &s;een to hye away pre&s;ently from <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where till then, they lay to doe &s;uch Service as they were directed to. And where, they are &s;aid, to have bragged, they would board, &s;inke, or &s;inke with the Queenes Ship, could they meet it. Gods Goodne&s;&s;e gave them not the power of try|all by Sea, though the Divells malice in them, made them attempt to doe that Mi&s;chief by Land. And to doe it the bet|ter, in the Night they landed &s;ome of their Men on &s;hoare, who were heard to enquire for the Queenes Lodging at three of the Clock, which they &s;hot at by &s;ix, a &s;hroud &s;u&s;pition (with the re&s;t) what was the Mark they aimed at.</P>
<P>Whether by Commi&s;&s;ion, and by who&s;e, the&s;e bould Men did this barbarous Outrage, the Ju&s;tice of Heaven and Earth will doubtle&s;&s;e concurr to examine and pu|ni&s;h, that &s;o great a Blot, and Burden of &s;hame and Guilt, may not lye on the Nation.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="11">
<P>Upon this deliverance from the &s;hot, Her Maje&s;ty went that Day further out of their reach; from <HI>Burlington Key,</HI> to the Town. And the Ammunition &s;hip (all this while in the <HI>Key,</HI> hit, though little hurt with all their &s;hots) was unladed, and the Arms carried to the Town, and there carefully kept, in the old Church of the Mona&s;tery, now decayed. The Pari&s;h for that Sunday, being de&s;ired for fear of danger, to go to their Neighbour Churches at hand, or to come &s;o many as could, to the Queenes Court; where by Her Maje&s;ties leave (there being el&s;e where no convenient Roome to be had,) Her Hou&s;hold had Service and Sermon for that Day.</P>
<P>At this, the Country People wondered much, who believed all with the Queen to be Papi&s;ts; though of all the Engli&s;h in Her Maje&s;ties Hou&s;hold, not one Woman, and but four men be all. So willing are &s;ome to deceive, and others to be deceived.</P>
<P>On Sunday after (nece&s;&s;ity pleading the Pa&s;&s;e) Her Maje&s;ty in the after-noone, Mar|ched with the Army and Ammunition from <HI>Burlington</HI> to <HI>Norburton</HI> (about foure Miles

Thence next Day to <HI>Malton.</HI> And (there the Foot being left) was next Day conducted by the Hor&s;e to <HI>York:</HI> No Ene|my all this while oppo&s;ing, or appearing.

Sir <HI>Edmund Cooper,</HI> Lord Major, (that true and tryed Lieutenant to his Liege) and Sir <HI>Thomas Widdrington,</HI> Recorder of the City, with Speeches to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>So She was brought with much Joy and Honour on Tue&s;day, <HI>March</HI> the &s;eventh, to Her Lodging in Sir <HI>Arthur Ingrams</HI> Hou&s;e, where a Court of Guard attends Her Ma|je&s;ties &s;afety, which the Guard and Bli&s;&s;e of Heaven make good to Her, as it hath hitherto been mo&s;t mercifully and vi&s;ibly with Her and for Her, in Her Departure, Ab&s;ence, and Return; which hath been happy, healthy, and &s;afe, almo&s;t to a Mi|racle.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of Her going out, were &s;trange beyond all belief. both at home and abroad: but the i&s;&s;ues have appeared good and happy above all expectation. And

<P>At Her Maje&s;ties fir&s;t comming out to Sea, the Storms were mo&s;t fierce and terri|ble for many Dayes; But at the &s;econd, the Winds and Weather mo&s;t faire and comfor|table all the time. God Allmighty mo&s;t mercifully pre&s;erved and ble&s;&s;ed Her Ma|je&s;ty in both. And at la&s;t gave Her an Arri|vall mo&s;t happy, both to Her Self, and to ma|ny. Since that He delivered Her from the vil|lainous attempts of the &s;hips at Sea, which put Her precious Life to a manife&s;t Perill and Hazard. A Signe from Heaven of Ble&s;|&s;ings to come upon the King and Queen, to which the Maje&s;ty of Heaven long pre&s;erve them, and the Kingdom by them.</P>

<HEAD>Her MAJESTIES LETTER Sent to the STATES, Concerning the &s;tay of HER AM|MUNITION-SHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>QVEENE</HI> OF <HI>GREAT BRITTAIN,</HI> out of a de&s;ire by all means to con|&s;erve the friend&s;hip betwixt the King, and the Lords the States; Having omitted to take notice of very many indigni|ties by which Shee hath been provoked here; doth finde Her Selfe at this pre&s;ent offended
<PB N="22" REF="13"> in &s;o high a degree, That Shee cannot any lon|ger, with the Honour of the King (Her mo&s;t Deare Husband) with-hold this Complaint, which Shee now makes unto the Lords the <HI>STATES,</HI> concerning an Order made to &s;earch and make &s;tay of a Ve&s;&s;ell, which is Fraughted and Charged with Goods belon|ging to Her; for which notwith&s;tanding, the <HI>STATES</HI> have already accorded their Free Pa&s;&s;e-Port. The <HI>QVEENE</HI> makes no difficulty to avow the tran&s;port of Ammuni|tion, as being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for Her &s;afety; and Shee hath cho&s;en to furni&s;h Her Selfe by this way, rather then that of demanding a Li|cence; by rea&s;on of an Order formerly made by the <HI>STATES,</HI> to forbid the tran&s;port of Arms, or Ammunition, either for the <HI>KING,</HI> or <HI>Parliament;</HI> Which Order, the <HI>KING</HI> hath great cau&s;e to believe, very partiall for the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by putting them in equall ranke with Him: But the default of Ob&s;ervation of that Order, hath been yet more di&s;plea&s;ing to Her; For that &s;ince that time, great quantities of Ammunition have been tran&s;ported for the Service of the Rebells, and Ships al&s;o bought
<PB N="23" REF="13"> to be employed again&s;t the <HI>KING.</HI> If the <HI>QUEENE</HI> hath not asked a particular Li|cence for all the things nece&s;&s;ary for Her Ser|vice, it hath been out of this con&s;ideration, that Shee might not ca&s;t the <HI>STATES</HI> upon the inconvenience, either of contradicting their own Order, or of giving ju&s;t offence to the <HI>KING.</HI> But &s;ince all the care Her Maje&s;ty hath taken, and the precautions u&s;ed to con&s;erve a good in|telligence between the <HI>KING</HI> and the <HI>STATES</HI> (which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;o many pa&s;t Treaties) hath produced nothing but a continuation of Affronts, and prejudices to the <HI>KINGS</HI> Service. Her Maje&s;ty is obliged to make this Declaration; <HI>That Shee receives this Order, given for the &s;tay of that Ship, for a notable and high inju&s;tice, and an indignity which Shee is obliged very neerly to re&s;ent.</HI> Wherefore Her Maje&s;ty doth expect, That the Lords the <HI>STATES,</HI> having better con&s;ide|red the matter, will give way to the departing of that Ship, together with what&s;oever is charged upon it, for Her Service; without which, Her Maje&s;ty cannot re&s;olve to depart Her Selfe. The <HI>QVEENE</HI> is obliged to repre&s;ent to the
<PB N="24" REF="14"> Lords the <HI>STATES,</HI> that this inju&s;tice, and Affront, which Shee hath received by the arre&s;t of this Ship, cannot pa&s;&s;e for le&s;&s;e then a viola|tion of the Friend&s;hip betwixt the <HI>KING</HI> and the <HI>STATES;</HI> the con&s;equences where|of will be very dangerous. Wherefore Shee doth hope, That they will not offer &s;o ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> cau&s;e of offence unto the <HI>KING,</HI> nor &s;o grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> a di&s;plea&s;ure unto Her Selfe.</P>
