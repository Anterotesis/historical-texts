<HEAD><HI>A True and Perfect Relation of the happy Succe&s;s and Victory obtained again&s;t the</HI> Turks <HI>of</HI> Argiers <HI>at</HI> Bugia, <HI>by His Ma|je&s;ties Fleet in the</HI> Mediterranean, <HI>under the command of Sir</HI> Edward Spragge.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving been Crui&s;ing for &s;everal days before <HI>Ar|giers,</HI> the Twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> being off at Sea, &s;ome Five or &s;ix Leagues, I met with the <HI>Mary, Hamp&s;hire, Port&s;mouth,</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> Fregats; and upon the notice they brought me of &s;everal <HI>Argiers</HI> Men of War being at <HI>Bugia,</HI> I called a Council of War, and it was voted, and thought fit, That I &s;hould make the be&s;t of my way (the Wind being then Ea&s;terly) to ply up thither with the <HI>Mary, Warwick, Advice, Gar|land, Port&s;mouth Pink,</HI> and the Fire&s;hips, to endeavor the de&s;troying them; the <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Fregats being left to crui&s;e off of <HI>Argiers</HI> till further order. The <HI>Dragon</HI> had been gone five days in chace of Two <HI>Argier</HI> Men of War, the Winds being then at S. W. it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Chace had carried him to the Ea&s;t|ward, and might at la&s;t be forced into <HI>Bugia,</HI> if not better Fortune, his being &s;o long ab&s;ent, and his well Sailing giving me the greater hopes.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"><!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->
<P>The Twenty third, the <HI>Dragon</HI> came into me, having been two days in fight with the Two <HI>Argier</HI> Men of War which he cha&s;ed, Capt. <HI>Herbert</HI> the Commander, being &s;hot in the Face with a Musket &s;hot, and Nine or ten of his men wounded with &s;mall &s;hot, who will all recover.</P>
<P>Until the Twenty eighth, the Winds were always Ea&s;terly, the &s;ame day, about Eight at Night, the Wind came up to the South We&s;t, with very great Gu&s;ts and Rain, which di&s;abled my <HI>Little Eagle</HI> Fire|&s;hip, leaving her not one Ma&s;t &s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth, I had got her Ma&s;ted and Rigged again fit for &s;ervice, having luckily a Corn Boat with me taken from the Enemy, which with the help of other Topma&s;ts and Booms, Ma&s;ted her. In this Weather, the <HI>Warwick</HI> hapned to &s;pring her Main Ma&s;t again, and bore away to the Chri&s;tian &s;hore; my <HI>Brigantine</HI> at the &s;ame time bore away, and as yet I have no news of her. The &s;ame day I got into <HI>Bugia</HI> Bay, and had a gale, which I thought would have carried me and my Fire&s;hips in upon them; but by that time we got within half &s;hot of their Ca&s;tles and Forts, it proved dead calm, and afterward the Wind came off the &s;hore, and a little further in the Road quite contrary.</P>
<P>The Second of <HI>May,</HI> the Winds being &s;o very un|certain, after having twice attempted with my Ships, and not able to do &s;ervice, for want of a certain Wind, every half hour bringing a &s;everal Wind with it, I re|&s;olved to make an Attempt upon them in the night with my Boats, and the &s;malle&s;t of my Fire&s;hips which row|ed as well as a Long-Boat: About Twelve a Clock at Night, I &s;ent out all the Boats I could make, and the <HI>Eagle</HI> Fire&s;hip, under the command of my Elde&s;t Lieu|tenant Ma&s;ter <HI>Nugent;</HI> but the Night proving very dark, and the high Land ob&s;curing the Ships as they neer'd them, they pa&s;&s;ed by the Ships (Lieutenant
<PB N="5" REF="3"><!-- PDF PAGE 57 --><HI>Nugent</HI> leaving one of the Boats with the Fire&s;hip, be|&s;ides her own) and rowed in to di&s;cover the Enemy, giving the Captain of the Fire&s;hip orders, in ca&s;e he found &s;hoal Water, to come to an Anchor: He was not a minute from him, when he found him&s;elf within half Pi&s;tol &s;hot of the Ships; upon which, he &s;teered off again to find the Fire&s;hip, which to his great a&s;toni&s;hment was all in a flame. The Enemy then taking the Alarm, it was not convenient for the Boats to attempt boarding and burning them, they being full of Men. Had not this misfortune of the Fire&s;hip hapned, they might at this time have been de&s;troyed without the lo&s;s of a Man. The next day they unrigged all their Ships, and made a Boom with their Yards, Topma&s;ts, and Cables, buoyed up with Cask; in all which time we had no opportunity of Wind to do any thing upon them. My other little Fire&s;hip being ready primed, by an accident of a Pi&s;tol fired by the Gunner, took fire, and was lo&s;t; all my hopes and dependency relying upon her to do this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in regard of her little draught of Water. Now having nothing to tru&s;t to, but the <HI>Little Victory,</HI> I pre|&s;ently gave order to have her lightned to as &s;mall a draught of water as could be, and brought her to eight foot.</P>
<P>On Munday Morning, being the Eighth of <HI>May,</HI> came to them &s;everal Recruits, both of Hor&s;e and Foot, with Ammunition, as we &s;uppo&s;e, from <HI>Argier,</HI> which they welcomed with great triumph by their firing of Guns from the Ships and Ca&s;tles, and putting abroad their Co|lours. But not knowing what other Recruits might come, I took the fir&s;t opportunity, and about Noon, the &s;ame day, it plea&s;ed God to favor us with a fair moderate Breeze at Ea&s;t, though after I had made the &s;igns for my Men of War to draw into a Line, and fall on, the Wind dollour'd again, which made me de&s;pair of being able to attack them: But it plea&s;ed God to order it &s;o, that
<PB N="6" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->about Two a Clock, the Gale came in as before; the <HI>Dragon, Advice,</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> borrowed too much of the South-We&s;t &s;hore; &s;o that they were forced to let go their Anchors in Three Fathom and half Water, and &s;o veered in, bringing their Ships broad &s;ide to pa&s;s: I my &s;elf came to an Anchor in Four Fathom, clo&s;e under their Ca&s;tles and Walls, battering all of us upon their Ships and Ca&s;tles for the &s;pace of Two hours. I &s;ent in my Pinnace, the <HI>Maries</HI> and <HI>Dragons,</HI> to cut the Boom, which was very bravely performed, Lieutenant <HI>Pin</HI> commanding the <HI>Maries</HI> Boat, Lieut. <HI>Pierce</HI> the <HI>Dragons,</HI> and one <HI>Harman</HI> (a Reformado Seaman of mine) my own Pinnace; my Second Lieutenant, Mr. <HI>Earnly</HI> being hurt with a &s;plinter in the Leg, and could not go; Eight of the <HI>Maries</HI> Boats Crew, and the Lieu|tenant were wounded with &s;mall &s;hot; Ten of the <HI>Dragons,</HI> and the Lieutenant wounded, and One killed; Seven killed out right in my own Pinnace, and all the re&s;t wounded except <HI>Harman</HI> that commanded. The Boom being then cut, I made the &s;ign for my Fire&s;hip to fall on: It plea&s;ed Almighty God to order it &s;o, That &s;he got in, and brought up athwart of their Bolt-&s;prits, their Ships being aground, and fa&s;t to the Ca&s;tles, burnt very well, and de&s;troyed them all, there being in num|ber Ten Sail; Seven of which, were the be&s;t Men of War belonging to <HI>Argiers.</HI> Capt. <HI>Harris,</HI> Commander of the Fire&s;hip, his Ma&s;ters Mate, Gunner, and one of his Seamen, are de&s;perately wounded with &s;mall &s;hot; but I fore&s;eeing the de&s;peratene&s;s and danger of the &s;er|vice that was to be done, Commi&s;&s;ionated a &s;econd Com|mander <HI>Henry Williams,</HI> one of my Ma&s;ters Mates, and late Commander of the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> Fire&s;hip, to take the charge upon him there on Board, in ca&s;e the other &s;hould mi&s;|carry, which he did accordingly, and performed it very well. The three other which we burnt, be&s;ides the Men of War, prove to be a <HI>Genoue&s;e</HI> a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and <HI>Satea.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->
<P>Upon the Tenth, about Eleven a Clock at Night, a <HI>Dutchman</HI> who hath been a Slave in <HI>Argiers</HI> for three years (and now with his Patron who commanded one of the&s;e Ships) made his e&s;cape by &s;wimming on Board me, and told me for certain, That they confe&s;s 360 of their be&s;t Men and upwards, all <HI>Turks,</HI> Soldiers in Pay, lo&s;t their lives on Board the re&s;pective Ships, by Fire and Gun-&s;hot, not being able to get a&s;hore. But, he &s;aith, he believes a great many more; for that their Ships were all extraordinary well manned, to the number of about 18 or 1900 Men, be&s;ides 300 that arrived there that Morning from <HI>Argier,</HI> who had been (in our view) re|ceived in great triumph; The Ca&s;tles and Town mi&s;era|bly torn, with an infinite number of the Inhabitants killed and wounded; and that which hapned very lucki|ly to &s;econd this Succe&s;s, was, That all their Chirurgeons Che&s;ts were burnt on Board their Ships, that they have not the lea&s;t Medicine to dre&s;s a Wound with.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Treky,</HI> their Admiral, is likewi&s;e wounded, who came with the be&s;t and chiefe&s;t Commanders in <HI>Argier,</HI> to order things in the be&s;t method they could for &s;ecu|ring their Ships, mo&s;t of which are &s;lain and wounded.</P>
<P>He al&s;o declares, That the&s;e Ships were purpo&s;ely commanded out by the <HI>Duan</HI> to find me out, and fight me, where ever they met me; and to that end, all the be&s;t Guns in tho&s;e Ships remaining in the Mole, were taken out and mounted in the&s;e; but Eight of which, in each of the&s;e Ships, were put a&s;hore to lighten them the better, the re&s;t are all burnt and &s;poiled.</P>
