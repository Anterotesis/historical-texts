<HEAD>The Royal PILGRIMAGE Or The PROGRESSE OF King Charles the II.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the la&s;t Campagna in <HI>England</HI> at <HI>Na&s;eby</HI> Field, and the Defeat of my Lord <HI>Goring</HI> pre|&s;ently after at <HI>Lamport,</HI> to which &s;ucceeded the Disbanding of my Lord <HI>Hoptons</HI> Army in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to whom the King had committed the Care of the Prince in that exigence and di&s;tre&s;&s;e of Affairs; It was directed by his late Maje&s;ty of ble&s;&s;ed Memory, that the &s;aid Prince &s;hould be tran&s;ported into the I&s;land of <HI>Scilly;</HI> accordingly he imbarqued him&s;elf with my Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and &s;ome of his principal Servants and other Gentlemen at St. <HI>Michaels-Mount,</HI> and ar|rived &s;afely at that I&s;land, where he was to attend his Fathers Orders in reference to his own Per&s;on, and the concerns of the Kingdoms.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>While he was there, he took order for the Govern|ment of that I&s;le, and placed therein Sir <HI>John Green|vill</HI> the Son of Sir <HI>Bevill,</HI> to command in chief in his Maje&s;ties name, who upon conditions in 1650. &s;urren|dred the &s;ame to the then called Parliament.</P>
<P>Upon Avi&s;oes from <HI>England,</HI> that there was &s;ome Loyal Endeavours on Foot to re&s;tore his Father, he Sayled into <HI>France,</HI> and was entertained there by the now French King, but with that coldne&s;&s;e and re|mi&s;&s;ene&s;s of re&s;pect that no way &s;uited to his Spirit, or his due greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>He had not been long there, but part of the Parlia|ments Fleet then commanded by Collonel <HI>Ramsbo|rough,</HI> returned to their Allegiance, and revolted from the &s;ervice, whereupon the Prince pre&s;ently left the French Court, and put him&s;elf on board that Fleet in the Admiral called the <HI>Reformation</HI> (which was after|wards lo&s;t about the I&s;land <HI>Majorca,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be|ing aboard her, and him&s;elf and three others hardly e&s;|caping) and lay &s;ome while in the <HI>Downes,</HI> till it was agreed that he &s;hould land &s;ome Forces, and attaque <HI>Deal</HI> and <HI>Sandwich</HI> Ca&s;tles, which accordingly he ma&s;te|red, with as much bravery and Gallantry of the Sea|men, as ever they yet manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>But notice of his formidable arrival being brought to <HI>London,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was forthwith ordered to equip all the &s;hipping could pre&s;ently be made ready to oppo&s;e him; at his appearance it was thought fit for the Kings Fleet to &s;ayl for <HI>Holland,</HI> and accordingly they anchored in <HI>Goree,</HI> where the Parliament Ships at|tended them, and required of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> either to have them delivered, or put to Sea to fight, judging that the Marriners for want of pay had de&s;er|ted their re&s;pective &s;hips; but the <HI>Hogens</HI> dur&s;t not then venture upon &s;uch an action, while the Kings inte|re&s;t &s;eemed yet to be promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Prince then went to the <HI>Hague</HI> to his Brother the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> where indeed he was civilly
<PB N="5" REF="3">and magnificently treated, with all the demon&s;trati|on of kindne&s;&s;e imaginable, which continued during that Princes life, and his &s;ojournment in that Country. From thence he writ that Letter to his Father which is printed at the end of the Kings book. Hither came un|to him my Lord <HI>Loughborough,</HI> Collonel <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey &amp;c.</HI> pre&s;ently after the Kings death, about which time <HI>Do|ri&s;laus</HI> was killed there by one Major <HI>Whitford</HI> a Scotch|man and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>Immediately after came unto him the Commi&s;sio|ners from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> tendring unto him their Fealty with &s;everal propo&s;itions, whereupon en|&s;ued a Treaty which was the next year concluded on at <HI>Breda,</HI> a Town belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the King by the name of <HI>Charls</HI> the &s;econd, &s;olemnly owned there by them; during which Treaty, my Lord the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was defeated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and barbarou&s;ly executed, to the di&s;honour of that Na|tion, and of <HI>Argyle</HI> e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>He departed about <HI>June</HI> 1649. out of <HI>Holland</HI> by <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where he was nobly entertayned to the French Court again, where he &s;taid not long, being wea|ry of Cardinal <HI>Mazarines</HI> neglects, but took &s;hipping for the I&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> where for a while he re&s;ided in <HI>Eli|zabeths</HI> Ca&s;tle, the Governour whereof was Sir <HI>George Cartret,</HI> where the Commi&s;&s;ioners from the King|dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> made their addre&s;&s;es to him, and de&s;ired that he would be plea&s;ed to repair to <HI>Breda</HI> in order to perfect the Treaty. By the way, we may not forget that gracious deliverance God gave him in his pa&s;&s;age back again from thence, the Ve&s;&s;el where|in he was, being with a &s;uddain gu&s;t of wind almo&s;t o|ver&s;et, had not one accidentally &s;tanding by the Sails, cut the ropes that held them.</P>
<P>At his arrival in <HI>Holland,</HI> I may not omit one pa&s;|&s;age. Before his departure from thence, came unto him an Envoy or Me&s;&s;enger from the French King, his Errand I do not very well remember, but it was &s;ome in&s;ignificant complement, and pre&s;&s;ed hard for Audi|ence,
<PB N="6" REF="4">at la&s;t my Lord Chancellor <HI>Hide</HI> procured it, and when he had told his Story, he expected the King would have made him an an&s;wer, but the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him without a word; at his next Audience, he was very urgent for an an&s;wer, but no other than before, while the <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> was overheard to &s;ay, that the King he knew well enough could &s;peak French, to which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to reply, that once in|deed he could &s;peak French, but had lately &s;tudied to forget it all, intimating the di&s;re&s;pects he had had from that Court. So much by the by.</P>
<P>From <HI>Breda</HI> he went to <HI>Schiveling</HI> near the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he took &s;hipping for <HI>Scotland,</HI> Old <HI>Martin Van Trump</HI> &s;etting him on board, and commending the care and pre&s;ervation of his per&s;on to his Son young <HI>Trump,</HI> who commanded the Fleet that tran&s;|ported him, which con&s;i&s;ted of four Sail of <HI>Dutch|men</HI> Men of War, the King him&s;elf being in a light Sayling Frigot of thirty &s;ix Guns. He landed in the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> after a dangerous voyage, be|ing ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> and mi&s;t the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Fleet that lay to attend his landing very narrow|ly, they having Sayled from thence but five hours before.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after his arrival in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he was Crowned on the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1650. at <HI>Scoon,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Dougla&s;&s;e</HI> preaching his Coronation Sermon, his Affairs there are &s;o well known to every body, that it is needle&s;&s;e to recite them here.</P>
<P>Neither is it more to our purpo&s;e to mention his expedition to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> his valour and great mind ma|nife&s;ted in the Action at that place, let us rather bu&s;ie our thoughts with the admirable goodne&s;s of God in his wonderful e&s;cape from the clutches of the per&s;ecu|ting RUMP, and that Rebel <HI>Oliver.</HI></P>
<P>Which way &s;oever he e&s;caped by the conduct of Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> (the general received opinion) he arriv'd about
<PB N="7" REF="4">the end of <HI>October,</HI> 1651. at <HI>Diep</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and &s;o on to <HI>Roan;</HI> upon the newes of his arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> all the great ones of that Court (the late Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> him&s;elf in per&s;on) went out to meet him, and congra|tulate his &s;afe return. But this fair weather la&s;ted but a while, and the King wi&s;ely removed him&s;elf from his <HI>French</HI> unho&s;pitable harbour, but before he went, he did as good as e&s;tabli&s;h the Crown of <HI>France</HI> upon his Cou&s;ins head, by bringing the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to a neutrality, when the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army had advanced beyond <HI>Paris;</HI> but I think he was never yet thankt for it.</P>
<P>His next &s;tage was the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> to his Si&s;ter of <HI>Orange,</HI> for the Prince her husband was decea&s;ed, where he re&s;ided till the Peace made betwixt tho&s;e States and <HI>Oliver,</HI> by which he was (as it were) bani&s;hed their Dominions, as by the like compact with <HI>Mazarine,</HI> he was the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>He retired thence to <HI>Colen</HI> a City of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to be near at hand his concernments, which were to be taken into con&s;ideration at the <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Franckfort</HI> upon the election of the new Emperour, whither he went privately, and walkt the &s;treets <HI>incog|nito,</HI> before the meeting of the States of the Empire, and Forein Emba&s;&s;adours.</P>
<P>He &s;ojourned al&s;o a while with the Duke of <HI>New|burgh,</HI> a Prince to whom the King is highly engaged for his manifold high obligements received from him during his abode there, <HI>Mannings</HI> Trea&s;on was di&s;co|vered, who kept corre&s;pondence with <HI>Thurloe, Nolls</HI> Secretary, and betrayed the de&s;ign of Mr. <HI>Penruddock</HI> in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>I may not omit that at <HI>Colen</HI> that Rogue <HI>Hannam</HI> with his complices, robb'd him of all the Plate he had, which the Burgers found out, and returned him again.</P>
<P>From thence he betook him&s;elf to the Court at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> being thither invited by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5">who was then newly entred into a war with <HI>Oliver,</HI> and had by him a Court a&s;&s;igned for him at <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> with a Princely maintenance to uphold it, where he remained &s;ome three yeares, till the late enterview of the Favourites upon the Frontire, where he was in private pre&s;ent, and from thence pa&s;t on to <HI>Madrid</HI> the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was there magnificently treat|ed by that King.</P>
<P>Thence po&s;ted he back again to St. <HI>Jean de Luz,</HI> where that impudent fellow <HI>Lockhart</HI> made oath he &s;aw him at Ma&s;&s;e, but had the reward of a <HI>Scot,</HI> not to be believed. In his return from thence through <HI>France,</HI> he was care&s;&s;ed all the way by the great ones of that Kingdome, and adored as a ri&s;ing &s;un, and at la&s;t &s;afely and happily returned to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where he now re|maines, waiting the good hour of our returning to our obedience.</P>
<P>Now what ob&s;tinate perver&s;e di&s;obedience can ob|ject any thing again&s;t this our rightful Soveraign, whom &s;o great experience, the knowledge of all places, men, and manners, acquired by his own view, have &s;o fitted and accompli&s;hed to Reign and Rule well, it having been the only &s;tudy in his Exile: God hath made him the better, and we the wor&s;e by his ab&s;ence.</P>
