<P>_FOR News thus it is with us, The greate&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our We&s;tern Gentry are profe&s;&s;ed Royal|i&s;ts. Two of them neare us are lately put into the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, enemies to the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">liament, and very unfit, though they were better affected: but &s;uch will &s;erve to doe mi&s;|chief well enough. At <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> Sr. <HI>Thomas Boyer,</HI> Sr. <HI>Wil|liam Morley,</HI> Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">wknor</HI> the Recorder, a Man that is throughly known for the New-Corporation, with three other me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> of note, came and demanded of Captain <HI>Chittey,</HI> for the King, the Magazine of the City: the Captaine being a man well affected refu&s;ed; they &s;aid very peremptorily, <HI>That they would have it be|fore the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rrow morning;</HI> he replyed very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>&s;hould not:</HI> &s;o he cau&s;ed a &s;trong Watch to be &s;et to keep it; and the next day appeared in the City well Armed, with many both of the place, and of the Countrey neare adjacent, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him and Guard him in his Office. St. <HI>Thomas Boyer,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Morly</HI> are Parliament Men, and &s;o is Captain <HI>May</HI> another of tho&s;e fixe.</P>
<P>It is reported, that they with the men above mentioned, and Doctors and Clergie men of the Cathedrall Church had plot|ted to betray the City to Collonell <HI>Goring&punc;</HI> Mr. <HI>Lewknor</HI> wrote to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> to the Collonell, to &s;ound the depth of his de|&s;igne: the Collonell &s;ent him word, <HI>That his Commi&s;&s;ion was to make</HI> Port&s;mouth <HI>as &s;trong as he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">or his Ma&s;ter;</HI> and that he hoped, that bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">h <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters">rs would be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him if need were. Since we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Recorder is gone to <HI>Port&s; mouth:</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> of our parts con&s;i&s;ts mainely in hone&s;t Trade&s;-me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">aught, as was &s;aid before, and the Country people are for the mo&s;t part blinded and mi&s;led by their malevolent Hedge-Prie&s;ts, there being not above &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> or &s;eaven hone&s;t Mini&s;ters here abouts. It is certaine,
<PB REF="2"> that 2 Cavelliers ravi&s;hed the &s;ame mayde, one after another neere <HI>Port&s;-mouth,</HI> while one &s;tood by and held their Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>It is related that three gallant Gentle-women de&s;ired to have a boat to wa&s;t them over to <HI>Stoke&s;bay</HI> a place betweene <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and the Ile of <HI>Wight</HI> but not obtaining, they were in a friendly manner brought back to the above named Sr <HI>Tho|mas Boyers</HI> hou&s;e in his coach: It is thought that they were men in womens apparell, becau&s;e they three were alone without any man.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Hin&s;haw</HI> one of the Prebendaries of the high Church of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> &s;ent a load of wheate into <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> but lately, as we heare. The Churchmen there are every day exerci&s;ing of their Light Hor&s;es in the Bi&s;hops clo&s;e: It is reported that one of them &s;ent his &s;ervant once, twice, and thrice, to Ma&s;ter <HI>Cawley</HI> a worthy Parliament man, and the chiefe Pillar of our Countrey on this &s;ide, intreating him to give him a meeting in the &s;aid Clo&s;e, and other places: but as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> refu&s;ed to meet <HI>Sanballat</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;alm</HI> in one of the villages of the plaine of <HI>One,</HI> where they thought to do him mi&s;chiefe; &s;o did this Gentleman very wi&s;ely and warily: He was willing to meete the Doctor at places which were not for his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">urne, and (as they &s;ay) he was &s;o often repul&s;t, that at length his &s;ervant was &s;ent with an excu&s;e, that the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">n was mi&s;taken. By the&s;e particu|lars you may a little di&s;cerne the &s;tate of our Countrey&punc; But notwith&s;tanding al this (the Lord be prai&s;ed) the Parliament I hope hath the better end of the &s;taffe. There is a Merchant in our Towne, which for three dayes together, law neare a man of War, lying before the Cows in the Ile of <HI>Wight;</HI> in this great Ship there is a <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Noble man (as they &s;ay) that hath done very good &s;ervice, he lyeth there and keepes provi&s;ion from going out of the Ile to <HI>Port&s;-mouth:</HI> he tooke a Boat la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ely fraight with light Hor&s;e Saddles and their, furniture going o|ver into the I&s;le, and for the u&s;e of the malignant Party, he a&s;|ked the boat-man what was his fraight, he &s;aid 9. &s;hillings, there tis quoth the Noble man, and paid him, &amp; bad him with|all
<PB REF="3"> to bring the Hor&s;es, &amp; he would give him another fraight. This Noble man hearing that one Captaine <HI>Newland</HI> had &s;ent provi&s;ion over to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> went a &s;hore and &s;ought about for him, prote&s;ting that he would &s;end him up to the Parlia|ment, the Cap. &s;culks and dares not be &s;eene, he is a great fat tall man of a very Heatheni&s;h behaviour, and (as I heare by an hone&s;t man that hath &s;een him there) lyeth at Ma&s;ter <HI>Moulins,</HI> when he commeth to <HI>London,</HI> on Fi&s;h-&s;treet hill. There is a Captaine that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Ca&s;tle neare the Cows, he had inveagled the Countrey round about, and by faire glozing &s;peeches had per&s;waded them to bring in their Arms into the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, telling them that they would be there kept in &s;afe|ty from the Cavaliers, and when there &s;hould be need of them he would redeliver them. But of late they of the Iland &s;u&s;pe|cting &s;ome trechery in the Captaine, becau&s;e they heard that the Earle of <HI>Portland</HI> was put out of the Governement, went and demanded their Armes, the Captaine denies to deliver them: they had no pre&s;ent remedy, but went and made their complaint to the above named <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Lord: he goes to the Captaine and demands the Armes for the Ilanders: the Cap|taine &s;tifly denyes, the Nobleman replyed, that if hee did not deliver them, he would heate down his Ca&s;tle about his eares, the Captaine remaines &s;tubborne &s;till, the Lord came with his Ship under the Ca&s;tle, intending to make good his thretning: But when the Captaine &s;aw whereto he mu&s;t, he yeelded at length and delivered the Armes.</P>
<P>There have bin three times Letters intercepted geing to, and coming from <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> At <HI>Havant</HI> neare <HI>Port&s;-mouth</HI> the Towne&s;men tooke a Travailer upon &s;u&s;picion, puld off his cloathes, and in his Bootes found Letters from the North to the Gari&s;on, the Letters were carried to Mr. <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> a good Gentleman hard by; he wi&s;ht that they had brought the me&s;&s;enger a&s;well as his Packet; whereupon a few lu&s;ty men went out with their mu&s;quets after him, and tooke him, and brought him to Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> who &s;ent him and his Letters up to the Parliament.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P> Another time there were letters pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> the Me&s;&s;enger went of purpo&s;e through by-ways, there met him a man (conceive, the &s;imple&s;t to &s;ee to, that ever you &s;aw, and you have his Image) who demanded of him whi|ther he was going, he &s;aid to <HI>Port&s;-mouth,</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting that &s;uch a &s;imple fellow would, or could defeate him, but that &s;im|ple unlikely man laid hold of his bridle, bad him to &s;tay, told him, that he was an Officer; with that came another man, who helped him, and &s;o they carried away the me&s;&s;enger to Mr. <HI>Nortons.</HI></P>
<P>This day Goodmen <HI>Fai&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Lewes,</HI> having been at <HI>Havant</HI> whither he was &s;ent by the Lady <HI>Clearke,</HI> Mr. <HI>Staples</HI> Wife, to learne the certainty of occurrences neere <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> brings Newes of a woman that was &s;ent out of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> with a pup|pet of clouts like a childe in her armes, &s;he came along by a Fort, which was fir&s;t built at <HI>Portsbridge</HI> within 3. miles of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> by the Cavaliers, but is &s;ince abandoned by them, and they retired into the Gari&s;on for feare of our Men, and &s;ince there are hundreds at worke about it, for <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Parli|ament,</HI> and have planted Ordnance upon it. The Cavaliers when they left it, drew away foure Pieces, and their Carriage breaking, they were faine to leave a fift upon the way. But to come to the woman again, one of our Men asked her what &s;he carried, &s;he &s;aid a childe, prithee let me &s;ee thy Baby, &s;aid he, &s;o &s;earch being made, it was found &s;uch as I &s;aid, the lower part was onely clouts, but in the head of it was a blacke Box full of Letters, Shee and her Stilborne, are carried to the right place, I warrant you. A Cavalier and his Man rode into <HI>Ha|vant</HI> upon lu&s;ty Steeds, labouring to rai&s;e there a Malignant party, to help him in plundering o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> Hou&s;e, the good Gentleman had newes of it pre&s;ently, he &s;ends out &s;ome of his Men on Light Hor&s;es with Pi&s;tols, who rode after the Cavalier and his Man, tooke them and brought them to their Ma&s;ter, who di&s;mounts them from their owne hor&s;es, &s;ets them upon a couple of jades, and &s;ends them up to the Parliament
<PB REF="4"> an hone&s;t man of my acquaintance was at Mr. <HI>Nortons,</HI> when this was done. After this a Troope of Cavaliers with certaine foot came up to <HI>Port&s;downe,</HI> and challeng'd Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> forth, &s;aying, where is this &s;ame <HI>Norton;</HI> where is he? I warrant him he is a very coward, let him come forth if he dare; and at this time they held the Fort; Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> hearing of it pre&s;ently Armes him&s;elfe, puts on his Buffe coate, and was riding out to them with his Men, and ju&s;t upon the &s;peed of it arrives at his hou&s;e a 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">0. light <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> from the Parliament, out they goe with him but when the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> &s;aw &s;uch a &s;trength come again&s;t them, they po&s;ted down the hill towards their Fort with great &s;peed, the Scots that were among Mr. <HI>Nortons</HI> auxiliaries, would pre&s;ently have flown on upon the Fort, but Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> would not &s;uffer them for feare of danger, there being Ordnance plan|there. Another time 30. of the Cavaliers came out in a vaun|ting manner, again&s;t whom went but 6 of our light Hor&s;e: the Cavaliers all di&s;ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rged upon them, but hurt never a man of them, onely hit one of their Hor&s;es on the &s;houlder, ea&s;ily curable; our &s;ix then made neerer up to them; the Cavaliers &s;eeing them &s;o ventrous, were &s;tricken with feare and fled, our men made after them amaine, and being within &s;hot of them, di&s;charged upon them, &s;hot one through the backe, who fell downe from his Hor&s;e dead in the place, another they hit in the breech, who fell likewi&s;e, but made a &s;hift to creep away into a hedge, and a third they tooke alive on his hor&s;e, &s;o they tooke a man and 3. Hor&s;es, being but 6 again&s;t 30. prai&s;ed bee the Lord of Hoa&s;ts for &s;o great a victory. It is &s;aid that the old Souldiers doe daily make e&s;cape out of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and it is thought that the re&s;t will gladly &s;urrender the Town, if once it were but formally demanded: for they begin already to be in di&s;tre&s;&s;e through want. One Mr. <HI>Bellingham</HI> a young Gen|tleman rode, armed capape from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> but now wi&s;heth that he were out again, and is at charges 5 <HI>&s;hillings</HI> a day onely for a boat, which lieth at hand, &s;till waiting for an opportunity to make his e&s;cape home, but cannot yet get way.</P>

<P> Some of the <HI>Scots</HI> that came among the 100 Troopers to <HI>M. Nortons</HI> &s;uccor, are of purpo&s;e billetted in one <HI>Bring&s;teds</HI> hou&s;e the Par&s;on of <HI>Havant,</HI> becau&s;e being a mo&s;t pe&s;tilent man he had provided a Light Hor&s;e for the &s;ervice of the Cavaliers, the <HI>Scots</HI> are with him therefore, and <HI>M. Norton</HI> hath charged him with the keeping of 10 Light Hor&s;e for the King and Parliament, becau&s;e he was &s;o bri&s;ke; and lately one of the <HI>Scots</HI> men being agreived with him, fell upon him and ba&s;ted him welfavouredly: and faine he would be gone, but they will not let him; &s;o he is forced to &s;tay, waites upon them dai|ly, gives them good words, and tells them, that he will gladly lie out of his owne bed to make them roome. And both here with us at <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ndell,</HI> and el&s;e where (as I heare) the <HI>P&s;almi&s;ts</HI> words are true: <HI>Gods enemies are found lyars to him,</HI> that is, they yeeld him &s;ained &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;peaking favourable of the Parli|ament, who not many daies agoe, had their mouths filled with other manner of language; and as it was in <HI>Mordica's</HI> time; many of the people of the Land became Iewes, becau&s;e the feare of the Iewes fell upon them: So I hope you will &s;hort|ly heare it to be among us every where; yet becau&s;e abundant warine&s;&s;e never harteth, therefore we neither are, nor will be &s;ecure, till there be no more cau&s;e of feare. Good-man <HI>Mai|&s;ters</HI> brings newes that the Papi&s;ts neere <HI>Port&s;-mouth</HI> do much mi&s;chiefe and that him&s;elfe was like to be taken by the Cava|liers, but there coming after him 2 Travailers hor&s;emen, acci|dentally, the Cavaliers thought that there were more coming, &s;o they fled away with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>It is reported by them that fall off from the Gari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> that the Collonel being angry with them of <HI>Go&s;|par,</HI> a Village not farre from the Towne, becau&s;e they would not come into his aide, commanded a Canoneer to let flie at their Hou&s;es, the Canoneer at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, but being threat|ned by the Collonell, that hee would run him through, if hee would not, hee &s;hot, but it was over the hou&s;es, and &s;o did, no harme.</P>
