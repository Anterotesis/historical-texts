<P>ON <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t the tituler King of <HI>Scots</HI> took &s;olemn leave of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> (his Brother in Law) and his Si&s;ter, there were many expre&s;&s;i|ons, and real tokens of love and affe|ction between the <HI>King</HI> and the young <HI>Prince;</HI> but (as &s;ome ob&s;erved that &s;tood by) what pa&s;t between the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> and him, favoured much of complement and outward &s;hew. At <HI>Breda</HI> he took his farewel of many of his old Servants, (having en|tertained new according to the late agreement in the Treaty, his Chaplains being al&s;o to &s;tay behind; one of them made a Speech, the Copy whereof is here in|clo&s;ed.

<P>IF per&s;ons de&s;cended of a Kingly race, de&s;ire to en|joy the Patrimony which was their Ance&s;tors, they ought to &s;eek it not by tyrannical wayes, but by means proportionable to the intentions of them who laid tho&s;e rich foundations; for he that is of a royal race, to enter into his inheritance, the wayes of wi&s;dom and vertue, are ever the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, and mo&s;t honoura|ble, and none are fitter to be of that Li&s;t, then men of &s;cience, con&s;cience, courage, and fidelity, parts belong|ing to the ornament, &s;upport, and maintenance there|of; and the&s;e &s;econded by the prerogative of antiqui|ty, (which age and time be&s;towes upon them) are the main pillers whereby royalty &s;ub&s;i&s;teth. To de&s;cend of royal blood provoketh to virtue, and therefore
<PB N="3" REF="3"><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> cho&s;e not to de&s;cend of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> which was the lea&s;t, but of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> which was the greater, and according to his example no man ought to boa&s;t him&s;elf di&s;cended of noble ance&s;tors, without imitation of their virtues, and to pre&s;ume no more then to di&s;cend of noble and royal Parents, is a thing mo&s;t vain; for <HI>Marius</HI> the Con&s;ul &s;aith, that he doth inherit very little which doth not inherit the ver|tues of his predice&s;&s;ors. And as your Maje&s;ty ought to follow by example the vertues of your Ance&s;ters; &s;o on the contrary to avoid and &s;hun their vices, you ought not onely to forbear to do injuries, but to re|venge them, for that which in the vulger &s;ort of people is called wrath, in your Maje&s;ty will be named pride: As ought therefore as you &s;hall confer with your own Con&s;cience, and remember from whence you came, you will never be troubled for the offences you have &s;moothered, but for the injuries you &s;hall revenge, for the pardoning of injuries, doth give great content to a noble &s;pirit; but the de&s;ire of revenge is a continual torment, and many times it happeneth, that &s;eeking to revenge a &s;mall injury, the party returnes much more injured, and before &s;atisfaction can be obtained, there may ari&s;e other new injuries. My &s;elf and ma|ny others mu&s;t now take leave of your Maje&s;ty, and have not wherewith to &s;erve you further then by our prayers, which &s;hall ever be for your height of hap|pine&s;s, not onely in this World, but that Kingdom which is eternal, and fadeth not away.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM <HI>PLYMO&V;TH.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMong&s;t the variety of Intelli|gence which floweth at this time in the&s;e parts, it is lawful to be ignorant of &s;omewhat. That which I chiefly de&s;ire to inform you of is, that which we have lately received by &s;ome Ships that came into this Harbor. As for the fight at Sea, about which I wrote unto you in my la&s;t: here is not a|ny full account given thereof as yet. It is be|lieved, that if any Ship were then taken, it was not Engli&s;h; for the fight being within &s;ight of the I&s;le of Wyght, if it had been a Friend of ours, &s;he might have run a&s;hore before the Enemy could have boarded her;
<PB N="5" REF="4">but that which is &s;poken of among&s;t us, is the &s;ight of a Fleet of ten Sayle of lu&s;ty Flemi&s;h Ships, which were lately di&s;cerned to &s;ayle towards the I&s;le of Jer&s;ey, two dayes &s;ince, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Guard for the Prince, but whether Vantrump were there in per&s;on, is not certainly known, though the Ships are conceived to be of his Fleet, and if the Prince were there, the Scots may yet look for their King, and when they &s;ee him, bid him gued morning for all day; but its likely he is come to con&s;ult with Hopton, and o|thers of the fir&s;t Edition, who&s;e advice hath had but &s;lender &s;ucce&s;s, when they had better Cardes, and if by the vent (as mo&s;t common|ly it is) the thing propounded be adjudged good or evil (though much more might be &s;aid thereof) what rational man can think that any great matters wil be enterprized by tho&s;e at this time, which (as Plutarch &s;aith) want plenty of young mens launces, and old mens councels, and money which gives mo|tion to the re&s;t. If the declared King of Scot|land be landed in Jer&s;ey, &s;urely he wil &s;end word to his Subjects there, that the Parlia|ments &s;hips ride &s;o thick on the Northern
<PB N="6" REF="5">Seas, that he could not find any pa&s;&s;age through them, which peradventure wil very well &s;atisfie their greedy de&s;ires, as to that point, but whether he comes to them or not, their de&s;ign mu&s;t go forward. Greenvil lives in the I&s;le of Cilly, upon fi&s;h, and what el&s;e the Iri&s;h Pirates bring him, the I&s;land not af|fording &s;ufficiency of it &s;elf, to &s;u&s;tain the In|habitants without &s;upplies by Sea: neither do we hear of any increa&s;e of forces come lately to him thither.</P>
