<HEAD>A true and perfect Narrative of the great and &s;ignal Succe&s;s of a Part of His Maje&s;ties Fleet under his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his Grace the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> burn|ing One hundred and Sixty Dutch Ships with|in the <HI>Vlie:</HI> As al&s;o the Town of <HI>Branda|ris</HI> upon the I&s;land of <HI>Schelling,</HI> by &s;ome com|manded Men under the Conduct of Sir <HI>Ro|bert Holmes,</HI> the <HI>8</HI> and <HI>9</HI> of this In&s;tant <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ON the 29 of <HI>July,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Fleet under his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his Grace the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> weighed Anchor from within &s;ight of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e for the <HI>Vlie;</HI> but the winds being contra|ry, they did not make the I&s;land till the 7 of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in which time &s;everal rich &s;hips happened to get in, which otherwi&s;e had fallen into their hands. Being come to an Anchor, the Generals were informed, That the I&s;lands of <HI>Vlie</HI> and <HI>Schelling</HI> were very ill guarded, notwith&s;tanding there were Store-hou&s;es both for the <HI>States,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Fleet,</HI> and Riches to a good
<PB N="4" REF="3">value, and what did weigh mo&s;t, a con&s;iderable num|ber of good Merchants &s;hips u&s;ually riding there; up|on which it was re&s;olved by the Generals, That there &s;hould be a &s;peedy Attempt made. A Councel of Flag-Officers was called, and it was determined there, that it &s;hould be carried on in the manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> That 300 Men &s;hould be drawn out of each Squa|dron, con&s;i&s;ting of two parts Landmen, and the third Seamen; the&s;e to be Commanded by Nine Captains, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Holmes,</HI> Rere-Admiral of the Red, to Command in chief. Sir <HI>Philip Howard</HI> to Command 120 Voluntiers. Captain <HI>John Bella&s;is,</HI> Captain <HI>Ha|man,</HI> Captain <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> Captain <HI>Haddocke,</HI> Captain <HI>Guy,</HI> Captain <HI>Silver,</HI> Captain <HI>Healing,</HI> Captain <HI>Butler,</HI> Capt. <HI>John Holmes,</HI> each to Command a Company. Sir <HI>William Jennings</HI> was al&s;o Ordered, That in ca&s;e they had attaqued both I&s;lands at one time, he &s;hould have Commanded one Divi&s;ion of the whole. The &s;hips appointed for this Expedition, were the <HI>Advice, Hamp|&s;hire, Tyger, Dragon,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> Fourth-Rates. The <HI>Garland, Pembrooke, Sweep&s;takes,</HI> Fifth-Rates. Five Fire|&s;hips, and &s;even Ketches; Which being in a readine&s;s, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 8 in&s;tant, about Eight in the morning weighed from the re&s;t of the Fleet, and came to An|chor about a League from the Buoyes, where they met the <HI>Princes</HI> Plea&s;ure-Boat, called the <HI>Fanfan,</HI> who had di&s;covered within a con&s;iderable Fleet of &s;hips near the <HI>Vlie;</HI> which proved to be 170 Merchant men, the lea&s;t of which was not le&s;s than 200 Tuns burthen, with two men of War, who had lately Convoyed near 100 of the afore&s;aid &s;hips from the Northward, homeward bound; &s;ome from the <HI>Streights,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Guinny,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> &s;ome from the <HI>Ea&s;t Countries;</HI> the re&s;t were outward bound, &s;hips all like|wi&s;e richly Laden.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> con&s;idering, That if he &s;hould proceed, as his De&s;ign was, fir&s;t to attempt the Land, that numerous Fleet might po&s;sibly pour in &s;uch num|bers of Men, as might render the Succe&s;s hazardous, re|&s;olved to begin with the &s;hips; and accordingly, having ordered the <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> to lie without the Buoyes, he weighed with the re&s;t of his Fleet; and the wind being contrary, he turned with much ado into <HI>Schelling</HI> Road, where the <HI>Tyger</HI> came to an Anchor; and immediately Sir <HI>Robert</HI> went on aboard the <HI>Fanfan,</HI> and put out his Flag; upon which the Officers came on board him, where it was ordered, That the <HI>Pemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ooke,</HI> which drew the lea&s;t water, with the five Fire&s;hips, &s;hould fall in among&s;t the Enemies Fleet with what &s;peed they could: Capt&punc; <HI>Browne</HI> with his Fire&s;hip cho&s;e very bravely to lye the bigge&s;t man of War on board, and burnt him down-right. Another Fire&s;hip running up at the &s;ame time to the other man of War, he back|ing his Sails, e&s;caped the pre&s;ent execution of the Fire|&s;hip; but &s;o, as to run him&s;elf by it on ground, where he was pre&s;ently taken by &s;ome of the Long boats, and fired. The other three Fire&s;hips clapped the three great Merchant-men on board, which carried Flags in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Main Tops, and burned them. This put all then Fleet in a great Confu&s;ion, which Sir <HI>Robert Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mes</HI> percei|ving, made &s;ign for all the Officers to come on board again, and pre&s;ently gave order that Sir <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">m J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n|nings,</HI> with all the Boats that could be &s;pared, &s;hould take the advantage, and fall in and burn, and de&s;troy all they could; but with a &s;trict Command they &s;hould not Plunder The Execution was &s;o followed, each Captain effecting his &s;hare, &s;ome 12, &s;ome 15 apiece, that of the whole Fleet there e&s;caped not above 8 or 9 &s;hips, one of which a <HI>Guinny</HI> Man of 24 Guns, and three &s;mall Privateers, who being driven up into a nar|row
<PB N="6" REF="4">corner of the Stream, &s;erved to protect four or five Merchant-men that were a head of them; where it was not po&s;&s;ible for our Boats to come at them; though even the&s;e few were much damaged. This work took up mo&s;t part of that day, being the 9 of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> &s;o that we had not day enough to fall upon the I&s;land of the <HI>Vlie;</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> being al&s;o informed by &s;ome Pri&s;oners, that the place was not &s;o con&s;iderable as it had been repre&s;ented; and Night coming on, and perceiving two of our Fregats, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dragon</HI> and <HI>Garlamd</HI> aground, it was thought mo&s;t convenient for all hands fir&s;t to go to work to get them off; Which be|ing done, he continued in his intention of attempting the <HI>Vlie</HI> the next morning, as &s;oon as the high Water would permit the motion of his Ve&s;&s;els, but his de|&s;ign was then likewi&s;e prevented; for &s;o great a Gu&s;t and Rain hapned that night, that the Arms and Am|munition in the Boats, Hoys, and Ketches, having received much damage, he thought it be&s;t to weigh, and as the wind &s;tood, to attempt &s;omething upon the I&s;land of <HI>Schelling,</HI> which the Morning proving moderate weather, he accordingly pro&s;ecuted, land|ing by the help of his Long Boats, Eleven Compa|nies on &s;hore, where he di&s;covered only &s;ome few &s;cattering fellows, but met with little or no oppo&s;i|tion. Leaving therefore one Company to &s;ecure his Boats, him&s;elf with Ten Companies marched up three miles to the Capital Town called <HI>Brandaris,</HI> a very fair Town or Dorp of above 1000 Hou&s;es; where keeping five Companies upon the skirts of the Town to prevent any &s;urpri&s;e of the Enemy, he &s;ent the o|ther five to fire and burn the Town; but finding them (as his vigilance was to &s;ecure a &s;afe retreat) &s;omewhat &s;low to execute that order, and fearing they might be tempted to forget them&s;elves in the pillage, he him&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="4">was forced to &s;et fire to &s;ome Hou&s;es on the windward, the &s;ooner to perfect the Work, and ha&s;ten his Men a|way; which burnt with that violence, that in half an hours time, the mo&s;t part of the Town was in a flame. The Town was reported by tho&s;e that were found in it, to have been very rich, and &s;o it appeared by &s;ome of the Soldiers Pockets; but very few people were to be &s;een in it, having had time to run away from the dan|ger, except &s;ome old Men and Women, who were u&s;ed with all gentlene&s;s and humanity.</P>
<P>The remaining Villages of that I&s;land, which are two or three, had certainly run the &s;ame fortune, but con&s;idering it was near high Water, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> thought it not fit to lo&s;e that opportunity of getting off to Sea, which he thought more con&s;iderable then to &s;tay 24 hours for the de&s;truction of them, remembring likewi&s;e that the channels between the <HI>Buoys</HI> were very narrow, and not bold without a frank wind. By high Water he got off all his men, and &s;et &s;ail out of that place, retain|ing &s;till his fir&s;t intentions of falling upon the <HI>Ulie;</HI> but as he was going on board, he received Orders from the Generals to return to the Fleet with all &s;peed, which accordingly he did that Evening, being the Tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> leaving behind him the marks of a &s;ingular conduct and mo&s;t vigorous execution, and bringing off, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable Booty to the private Sol|diers and Seamen, the States Plea&s;ure-Boat of Twelve Guns, without other lo&s;s then of &s;ix men killed, and about as many wounded.</P>
