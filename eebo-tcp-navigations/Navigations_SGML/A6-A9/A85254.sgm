<HEAD>1. <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>fir&s;t learnt his Art, under one Bi&s;hop</HI> Allen.</HEAD>
<P>_ALL men if they learn an Art &s;erve &s;ome time to it, as <HI>Hind</HI> did to one <HI>Allen,</HI> who named him&s;elf, <HI>Lord Bi&s;hop of Durham,</HI> or of &s;ome other place, as his bu&s;ine&s;s lay.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>This <HI>Allen</HI> was once a Trades|man in <HI>London,</HI> but trading failing, &s;old his &s;tock to &s;et up another trade: &s;o he bought a Coach and four Hor|&s;es, and had &s;ix men to wait on him in Livery Cloaks, with a Gentleman U&s;her: He habited him&s;elf in a Ruff, a &s;quare Cap, Lawn Sleeves, and his long Gown: So riding in this State they did many Robberies undi&s;cove|red; for when any Gentleman Rod their way, they would leave their Cloaks in the Coach, and do a Rob|bery, and then put their Booty into the Coach, and get their Livery Cloaks on their backs; if any hue and cry came after them, they would never &s;u&s;pect any of the Bi&s;hops men: &s;o when they came to any Inn, the Bi&s;hop was honoured, as much as a man of his quality, for his Gentle|man U&s;her &s;tood bear all the while he was at dinner or &s;upper. But this did not hold long, for they were di&s;covered by &s;ome words; but ha|ving
<PB N="9" REF="5">notice there of, they went far from the place, after they were known or di&s;covered: And now they plot|ted to get rid of their Coach, for they were afraid that would betray them: whereupon they begun their plot; and as they rid along the Downs, they &s;aw a hand&s;ome old Shepherd to whom they &s;aid old man, <HI>If you plea&s;e to be merry to night with us, you &s;hall do as we do;</HI> &s;o the old man or as willing to go with them: <HI>Allon</HI> told him, <HI>That he would make him L. Bi&s;hop for that night:</HI> So they put on the Bi&s;hops habit on the Shepherd, and it did become him very well then they in&s;tru|cted him how to behave him&s;elf: So they came to the Inn, where in great pomp they &s;upped: Supper being ended, the Bi&s;hops &s;ervants went to have their Lord to bed: he being in bed they came down, and told the Ho&s;t, that their Lord was faln very &s;ick, and that he de&s;ired a Doctor;
<PB N="10" REF="6">&s;o they enquired for a Doctor, but there was none in 7. miles: then they forged letters that all the men were &s;ent with &s;pare hor&s;es to fetch friends, &s;ome to &s;ee their Lord, and &s;om for the Doctor: that they left no &s;ervants to wait on the Bi&s;hop. They had al&s;o charged the &s;hepherd not to knock till they came to him the next day; and they cau&s;ed the people of the hou&s;e not to go to their Lord till he knock'd for them, and then to carry him a <HI>Caudle:</HI> So they con|veyed away their Bi&s;hops Robes, and left the Shepherds Coat by his bed&s;ide: &s;o the&s;e Lads bid farwel to their Shepheard and their Coach: but about 10 of the clock in the mor|ning the Shepheard awaked, as out of a <HI>dream,</HI> and knocked for the people, who brought him up a <HI>Caudle;</HI> he asked where were all his men; who an&s;wered that &s;ome were gone for a Doctor, and &s;ome for his friends; he bid the &s;ervant go down for his Ma|&s;ter;
<PB N="11" REF="6">the &s;ervant well eying the Shepherd, &s;aid to his Ma&s;ter; Sir, <HI>The Bi&s;hop has a Canvas &s;hirt on as black as the Devil; and there is a pair of &s;hooes &s;tands by the Bed, as full of hob-nailes, as the skie is full of &s;tars; and there lies a threedbare coat on the bed, that is fit for nothing but to make &s;hoo clouts;</HI> &s;o the ho&s;t went up to &s;ee his gue&s;t, which by this time had dre&s;t him&s;elf in his own habit; who when he &s;aw his ho&s;t, &s;aid, <HI>Friend, I have been robbed to night of mine ho|nour; but they left me mine own cloaths:</HI> whereat the ho&s;t began to laugh; and &s;ay unto the Shepherd: my Lord, <HI>If you plea&s;e to buy you two Coach Hor&s;es, I will lend you a Coach and Harne&s;s to carry your honour to the &s;heepfold:</HI> So the Shepherd related all the &s;tory to the ho&s;t; and left them his Coach for the reckoning, and bid them adieu.</P>

<P><HI>HIND</HI> having lo&s;t his hor&s;e, whereby his trade fail'd, was re&s;olved to get one, or to follow the trade on foot, and for to colour his knavery, put him&s;elf into the habit of a Shepherd, with a pike &s;taff of &s;even foot long in his hand, and then travels toward <HI>Banbury;</HI> where in his rode he e&s;pied a Gentleman co|ming down a hill leading his hor&s;e in his hand; <HI>Hind,</HI> as if he took no no|tice of the Gentleman, went whi&s;t|ting the tune of an ordinary <HI>p&s;alm;</HI> when the Gentleman came to the foot of the hill, where <HI>Hind</HI> now &s;tood whi&s;tling his <HI>P&s;alm;</HI> the Gen|tleman inquired of him the time of the day, he an&s;wered him very civi|ly; but as the Gentleman was get|ting on his hor&s;e, his back being to|wards
<PB N="14" REF="8"><HI>Hind, Hind</HI> hit him &s;uch a &s;troke between the head and the &s;houlders, that he made him mea&s;ure his length on the ground; <HI>Hind</HI> pre|&s;ently &s;eized on his money and cloak, hor&s;e and &s;word, and left him his old coat and his pike &s;taff, to beat on the hoof as he had done, and money he gave him back to bear his char|ges: But to this day, <HI>The Gentleman loves not the tane of a P&s;alm.</HI> But now <HI>Hind</HI> being wel hor&s;ed, &amp; having money and good cloaths, went to <HI>Banbury,</HI> where he was entertained in a Troop, and quickly acquainted him&s;elf with &s;ome of his own pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and now he begins to rob <HI>Cum Privilegio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hind</HI> being in <HI>Banbury</HI> Gari&s;on, where he had good &s;helter for all his knavery, he makes a new trade: For no Carrier could pa&s;s his Roads, without paying Tribute to his Company, or lo&s;ing the be&s;t of their goods: but rather then the
<PB N="15" REF="8">Carriers would be always haunted for uncertain &s;ums, they promi&s;e him and his Company a certain &s;ti|pend a week to let them pa&s;s: You may ea&s;ily believe that the&s;e Lads did as vigilantly watch their com|ing from <HI>London</HI> for their promi&s;ed money; as the Exci&s;e-men did in tho&s;e days, watch the Cattell going to <HI>Smith-Field.</HI></P>
<P>But when the Parliaments For|ces went again&s;t <HI>Banbury,</HI> and his Trade there began to fail; He thought it no Robery to borrow Sir <HI>William Comptons</HI> be&s;t hor&s;e, who was the Governor then of that Gari&s;on, to keep up his Trade in the High-way, &s;eeing his Gari&s;on failed.</P>
