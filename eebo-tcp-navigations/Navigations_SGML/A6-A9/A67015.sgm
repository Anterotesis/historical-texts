<PB N="2" REF="4"> of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the great concerns of your Soul, <HI>like Sheep without a Shep|herd&punc;</HI> or think your &s;elves altogether for|gotten and unpitied by your Country-men; I have &s;ent this Letter to you, in the Bowels and Affection of a <HI>Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort you under your pre|&s;ent &s;ufferings, and to further you in the attainment of <HI>everla&s;ting Re&s;t:</HI> earne&s;tly Praying, that the <HI>Grace and Ble&s;&s;ing of God</HI> may accompany the&s;e few lines to your effectual Edification and Salvation: in or|der to which I humbly entreat you &s;eriou&s;|ly to peru&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place. Let me beg of you to con&s;ider the righetous hand of God in your pre&s;ent confinement and affliction; and to lay your hand upon your mouth, to &s;up|pre&s;s all murmuring and di&s;content at his Providence. For no man living has any Rea&s;on to complain again&s;t God's Govern|ment: Nor have you the lea&s;t ground for it in this ca&s;e; whether your pa&s;t Life has been &s;pent <HI>profitably</HI> or <HI>unprofitably.</HI> If the former be your happy Ca&s;e, if you have advanced in the Knowledge and practice of all <HI>Chri&s;tian Dutys</HI> as you ought to have done: It may be, God has providentially di&s;po&s;ed your habitation for a time among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> that they might &s;ee and admire the <HI>Holy Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Heavenly Lives</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and be brought over by your Example to own
<PB N="3" REF="4"> and embrace the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith:</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;ent <HI>in Chains to Rome,</HI> that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> might flouri&s;h there <HI>thro' his Bonds.</HI> And if &s;o, you have great Hon|our done you as Gods Me&s;&s;ingers: and you have the happy opportunity of obtain|ing the infinite Reward promi&s;ed to <HI>&s;uch as turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But if on the <HI>contrary,</HI> your pa&s;t Life, has been very barren and unfruitful of all good, very negligent of the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and very guilty of &s;undry impieties and Immoralities: God here gra|ciou&s;ly gives you a time to repent and reform, before you go down to remedile&s;s Torments: You have then no manner of rea&s;on to complain of hard dealing from the hand of God, but on the contrary to admire his goodne&s;s and Patience, and to be lifted up in Love and devotion to him, who hath &s;pared your Soul from Death, even from <HI>eternal Death and de&s;truction,</HI> which is ju&s;tly de&s;erved by every Sin, and is di&s;maily challenged and provoked by a continued cour&s;e of &s;in. So that in this Ca&s;e (which is I fear, the mo&s;t u&s;ual) the good providence of God &s;eems to in|tend a double Kindne&s;s to you, by way of correction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t to make you &s;en&s;ible of your great Sin and folly in &s;lighting and neglecting the Light, Grace, and Mercy of the <HI>Holy
<PB N="4" REF="5"> Go&s;pel.</HI> That you might now by &s;ad ex|perience be taught how mi&s;erable it is to be de&s;titute of <HI>Chri&s;tian Sermons, Sabaths,</HI> and <HI>Sacraments:</HI> To want the food of &s;pi|ritual Life, the Light of revealed Doctrins, and the conver&s;ation of holy and exem|plary Chri&s;tians. That you might now long after the publick Service of God, and above all things reli&s;h <HI>Communion with him thro' his Son</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> an other rea&s;on of Gods good providence in this your affliction may be, to withdraw you from your former <HI>evil Cour&s;es,</HI> and to &s;top that fierce car|rier in Sin, which might perhaps, in the former po&s;ture of things, have been moral|ly remedile&s;s: Had you had your full Li|berty, your old companions, your former plentiful and unafflicted State, you would perhaps have gone on &s;till in tho&s;e Sins to which the&s;e circum&s;tances induced you before: And &s;o you would have daily in|crea&s;ed in guilt and hardne&s;s of Heart. But now the &s;cene is quite altered, and all things appear <HI>new</HI> to invite you to &s;erve God <HI>in newne&s;s of Life.</HI></P>
<P>We may well &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e were the kind intentions of the gracious Provi|dence of God in this pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation, becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured from his own word, <HI>That he corrects us for our Profit</HI> (Heb.
<PB N="5" REF="5"> 12. v. 5. <HI>And that he dealeth with us herein as a Father with his Children</HI>) And when you have thorowly learnt the&s;e Le&s;&s;ons, which were the cau&s;e of your be|ing brought into the <HI>School of Affliction;</HI> you may then comfortably hope that God will find out means that his <HI>Bani&s;hed be not</HI> finally <HI>expelled;</HI> and that he will bring you to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e your own Land again, when you know well how to value and improve the mercies of it. As a <HI>Gentleman</HI> u&s;ed to keep little Birds in Cages till they could &s;ing tunably and artificially, and then turn'd them loo&s;e into his Grove, when they had perfectly gotten their pro|per Le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>I Therefore entreat you, <HI>my Brother,</HI> to look back &s;eriou&s;ly upon your pa&s;t Life, and bring every part of it, as near as po&s;|&s;ible, to the Tryal of Gods <HI>Holy Com|mandments.</HI> Inquire impartially, by what <HI>Rules</HI> you have lived, from what <HI>Principles</HI> you have acted, and by what <HI>Motives</HI> you have been led? whether you have lived after the <HI>Will of God,</HI> or after your <HI>own Hart's de&s;ire?</HI> and whether your Soul has been chiefly &s;way'd by thelove of God or of this pre&s;ent World? And where you perceive any marks of your pa&s;t Guilt, ra&s;h ne&s;s, and unthankfulne&s;s; &s;ay with the Prophet (Amos. 7. 9.) <HI>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becau&s;e I have
<PB N="6" REF="6"> &s;inned again&s;t him.</HI> And then al&s;o, reti|ring to the mo&s;t convenient Place that your pre&s;ent condition affords, pour out your Soul to God in earne&s;t prayer and &s;ay.</P>

<HEAD>A Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>O Mo&s;t wi&s;e and good God, I humbly acknowledge that all thy ways to|wards me a mo&s;t &s;inful Creature have been infinitly righteous and good. Thou in thy faithfulne&s;s ha&s;t afflicted me here that I might not peri&s;h for ever. Enable me I pray thee by thy grace to an|&s;wer the merciful Ends of this Afflicted which thou ha&s;t brought upon me. Lead me O God of all grace, unto unfeigned Repentance for all the Iniquitys and unpro|fit ablene&s;s of my pa&s;t Life. Forgive methat I have loved darkne&s;s more than Light, and neglected the mini&s;tration of thy holy word and Sacraments, and have been more concerned for the things of this Life than that which is to come. I de&s;ire with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow to lament my rejecting of thy Son, my grieving of thy Spirit, and ne|glecting, that great Salvation which has long been offered me in thy Go&s;pel. O Lord vouch&s;afe to give me Repentance and Par|don of all my grievous offences thro' our exalted Prince and Saviour And make me ever hereafter to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly
<PB N="7" REF="6"> and godly, as it becometh thy holy Go&s;pel: to the ble&s;&s;ed Ordinances and Enjoyments of which, I be&s;eech thee, in thy due time to re&s;tore me; and make me to adorn the holy profe&s;&s;ion of a Chri&s;tian in all righteou&s;ne&s;s and and true holine&s;s. And during my pre&s;ent Want of tho&s;e gracious in&s;titutions, vouch&s;afe, O Lord, to commu|nicate the riches of thy Grace to me in &s;uch other ways and means as to thine infinite Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem good, that I may not be as a dead branch broken off from the true Vine, but may now and ever be accounted of the number of thy true <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> thy be|loved people in our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> for who&s;e &s;ake, vouch&s;afe to here me and accept me, together with the&s;e my unworthy Prayers, in who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Name and words, I humbly conclude them. <HI>Our Father which,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>In the <HI>next place</HI> I de&s;ire you to con&s;ider the awfulne&s;s, &s;olemnity, and &s;trictne&s;s of your <HI>Chri&s;tian Vows</HI> made in your <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and renewed a fre&s;h (if you have indeed lived as a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>) at the <HI>Holy Table</HI> of our Lord. It is not a light matter to make a Promi&s;e to the <HI>Almighty Soveraign of the World;</HI> but to make <HI>Solemn Vows</HI> to him before cho&s;en Witne&s;&s;es, and in the face of a <HI>Chri&s;tian Congregation,</HI> and to &s;eal this in the <HI>Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> that blood which is of infinite worth, and which &s;hews the
<PB N="8" REF="7"> greate&s;t Love and Pity to us that ever was &s;een in the World, which has a vertue to <HI>wa&s;h away Sin,</HI> and to <HI>open the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> to &s;uch as are purified thereby: How <HI>Sacred,</HI> how <HI>&s;trict,</HI> how <HI>tremendous</HI> are &s;uch <HI>Vows!</HI> And how &s;orely will our Righteous God avenge every wilful Viola|tion and &s;light of them? This is called a <HI>trampling on Chri&s;t's blood,</HI> and the &s;ore&s;t puni&s;hment is threatned to &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions: e&s;pecialy to &s;uch as turn Renegado's and deny this Faith into which they were Baptized <HI>in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>they count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing;</HI> they count the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> an Impo&s;tor and a wicked cheat, and con|&s;equently his blood vile and ba&s;e, and a Covenant with him a de&s;picable and hate|ful thing to be renounced and abandoned. And they <HI>do de&s;pight to the &s;pirit of Grace;</HI> they treat that Holy, gracious and Eternal Spirit with Scorn and Hatred; tho' it be that Spirit which alone can prepare us for Eternal Salvation. So that this is the mo&s;t wretched and de&s;perate Ca&s;e that we can imagine, for it follows, <HI>Vengeance is mine I will repay, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> They &s;hall feel the inutterable wrath of an <HI>Al|mighty God</HI> in it's mo&s;t horrible Execution upon them for ever, except they deeply Repent. You have all this, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 10. 28, 29, 30. Where it is al&s;o added in the next
<PB N="9" REF="7"> ver&s;e. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI> So dreadful indeed, that the wi&s;e and good Men of all Ages have cho&s;en rather to be <HI>Sawn a &s;un|der,</HI> or <HI>Torn with wild Bea&s;ts,</HI> or give <HI>their Bodies to be broil'd</HI> and expo&s;ed to all the Mi&s;eries that men could invent or inflict, than to deny their Faith, and thereby fall under the Vengeance of <HI>Almighty God</HI> to all Eternity. And the lea&s;t grain of Faith mu&s;t needs con&s;train us all to do the like, thro' the grace of God; for what propor|tion is there betwixt the Anger of a frail man like our &s;elves who <HI>can but hurt our bodys</HI> and that but for a <HI>little while;</HI> and the di&s;plea&s;ure of an <HI>Eternal and Omnipo|tent God,</HI> who can puni&s;h us not only with all bodily tortures, but with &s;uch horror and de&s;olation of Soul as far exceeds them, and that not only for Millions of Millions of Ages, but time without End.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider therefore, <HI>my Brother,</HI> that you have devoted your &s;elf entirely to God thro our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> to your Life's end. And that to do otherwi&s;e will be the blacke&s;t <HI>Perjury, Sacrilege,</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;|tacy:</HI> So that your Eternal Hope leanes on your upright di&s;charge of this contract, made with God your Saviour in this &s;o|lemn tran&s;action of the <HI>Bapti&s;mal Cove|nant.</HI> And be you well a&s;&s;ured, That there is <HI>Salvation in no other</HI> Per&s;on but in
<PB N="10" REF="8"> that of our <HI>Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And that you may cleave &s;tedfa&s;tly to him with all your Soul in Profe&s;&s;ion and in Practice, let me de&s;ire you to con&s;ider the&s;e few things,</P>
<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour</HI> propo&s;es no|thing to us in order to our Salvation but what is <HI>Excellent, Admirable,</HI> and <HI>Advan|tagious</HI> in it &s;elf. To love God above all, to beleive and tru&s;t in him who came to lead us from Sin and Di&s;truction, to love our Brethern as our &s;elves, to Pity and Pray for our Enemies, and to live &s;oberly and hone&s;tly in the cour&s;e of our Lives: how &s;weet and lovely are the&s;e things, which are &s;et to keep us from brutal Lu&s;ts, and infernal pa&s;&s;ions, to lift up our Souls to the likene&s;s of God, and the dignity of holy Angels.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, that our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour</HI> will be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t you by his <HI>holy Spirit</HI> in all the work that he re|quires at your hands. He will help you to &s;ubdue your corruptions, to conquer temp|tations to bear afflictions, and in &s;hort, to pa&s;s undefiled thro' this pre&s;ent World, and to attain the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the other. He has a&s;&s;ured us, that he will as readily <HI>give his holy Spirit</HI> for tho&s;e ends to &s;uch as dnely &s;eek him, as ever <HI>Parent gave a bit of Bread to his own Child</HI> crying to him
<PB N="11" REF="8"> for hunger. <HI>Luke.</HI> 11. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. See al&s;o <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. from the 25 ver&s;e to the end of the Chapter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider that the term of our pre|&s;ent Life is very uncertain, and at the ut|mo&s;t very &s;hort. Whether we live well or ill, we &s;hall &s;oon fini&s;h our Cour&s;e. The mirth of wicked People is but &s;hort at the be&s;t: and the Labors and &s;ufferings of good People are but &s;hort at the wor&s;t. We &s;hall &s;oon have done with this proba|tional Life, <HI>for our days upon Earth are but as a &s;hadow (1 Chron.</HI> 29. 15.) And there is this va&s;t difference in the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of things between good and bad people. That the wicked Mans plea&s;ures dye in the enjoyment, and inward darkne&s;s and regret &s;prings up in their room, if he has any &s;en&s;e left: But the good man's Difficulties are le&s;&s;en'd every moment, and there is an eternal founda|tion of comfort laid hereby. The wicked per&s;on has a <HI>little Sun&s;hine</HI> in the morning, as <HI>Sodom</HI> had; and like it, is &s;uddenly overwhelm'd by a <HI>&s;hower of Fire, and Brim|&s;tone.</HI> And the faithful Chri&s;tian, has a little <HI>bad Weather</HI> perhaps in the morning, but he is riding out of it into <HI>perfect &s;e|renity and Bli&s;s.</HI> The one &s;ays with <HI>Jo|nathan, I have ta&s;ted a little Honey, and I mu&s;t dye for it.</HI> The other &s;ays, with St. <HI>Paul, I have fought a good Fight, I
<PB N="12" REF="9"> have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith; henceforth there's laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;n&s;s.</HI> (2 Tim. 4, 7.) And this leads me to another con&s;iderra|tion, which I be&s;eech you to keep up always in its Vigor in your brea&s;t; which is.</P>
<P N="4">4. The exalted <HI>Degree</HI> and Eternal <HI>Du|ration</HI> both of the Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments of the world to come. <HI>The wicked &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment. But the Righteous, into Life Eternal.</HI> Math. 25. 46. Con&s;ider, <HI>my Brother,</HI> you cannot hold your hand in the fire which burns on your Hearth for one hour, with|out &s;uch Angui&s;h as you reckon intolerable: How <HI>can you then dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings!</HI> And this in utter Darkne&s;s! in company with other howling de&s;pera|does, and mocking Devils! Where is our &s;en&s;e, and our &s;elf-love, when we do not &s;trive to e&s;cape this place of Torment? For it is the amazing aggravation of the&s;e mi&s;eries, that they never end. How dole|ful a thought is it that after all the time we can think of is &s;pent, there will &s;till be as much torture to come to the damned as at the Fir&s;t moment in which they en|tered into it! Let not &s;uch a thought as this pa&s;s off ha&s;tily <HI>my Brother,</HI> but give your mind lei&s;ure to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> it till it kills the very thought and de&s;ire of &s;inful injoy|ments
<PB N="13" REF="9"> which are but for a moment. Suppo&s;e therefore, that a nimble Writer did &s;et him&s;elf for one whole day to ad|vance the bige&s;t &s;umm in Numeration that he was able: How va&s;t would the num|ber of Years be that he would &s;et down before Night! every &s;ingle figure that he made towards the clo&s;e of his Labour would contain an inconceivable term of time, and the whole &s;umm would utterly a&s;toni&s;h us.</P>
<P>Now, I would ask any one who beleives a Life to come, whether of the&s;e two conditions is to be cho&s;en, either to live <HI>three&s;core and ten years</HI> (the common Age of man) in the love and &s;ervice of God, and then to enjoy all de&s;irable Ble&s;|&s;ings for all <HI>tho&s;e Millions of years</HI> which would be contained in that &s;umm before mentioned? Or, on the other hand, To live according to our fooli&s;h and extrava|gant Will for the &s;pace of <HI>Seventy years</HI> and then to ly in flames and exqui&s;ite tor|tures for &s;uch a <HI>va&s;t and a&s;toni&s;hing term of Years,</HI> as the afore&s;aid <HI>Arithmetician</HI> had &s;et down? In this ca&s;e: every one would &s;peedily determine for the &s;ervice of God, and the ble&s;&s;ed Hope that attends it. And yet, this is nothing of a paral|lel ca&s;e to Eternity. For tho', not onely that one man, but every per&s;on in the World, added <HI>&s;umm</HI> to <HI>&s;umm</HI> throughout their whole Life, and if all the Angels,
<PB N="14" REF="10"> good and bad, threw in all the <HI>Numbers</HI> that they were able, to &s;well the prodigi|ous Account to the utmo&s;t Advance they could and after this double and treble the <HI>whole</HI> to the utmo&s;t that your mind can imagine: Yet &s;till there is more in this one word <HI>Eternity</HI> than all this. And we may hence learn, what wonders a lively Faith in the <HI>Go&s;pel of our Lord</HI> would be able to do, were it duely improved and excited! It would not only remove <HI>Mountains,</HI> but the <HI>whole World,</HI> when ever it &s;tood in our way to <HI>Heaven:</HI> and we &s;hould with great &s;corn and indignation &s;ay, <HI>what &s;hould I be advantaged, if I gain'd the whole World, and lo&s;t my immortal Soul by the bargain?</HI></P>
<P>Fix your mind &s;eriou&s;ly on the&s;e things, <HI>my Brother;</HI> till you find your heart <HI>affect|ed</HI> with the meditation, and then direct your Soul with fervor to the <HI>Throne of Grace,</HI> and &s;ay.</P>

<P>And now, my Brother, having &s;hewn you the never failing way to true Content|ment here, and to eternal happine&s;s here|after; Let not the <HI>bitterne&s;s</HI> of any tem|poral &s;ufferings leaven your Soul: nor run you into &s;ullenne&s;s, frowardne&s;s, or the withdrawing of your heart from God. Be you a&s;&s;ured, that God hath brought many a per&s;on whom he hath greatly loved into wor&s;e &s;orrows and &s;treights than you are burthened with all. The beloved Di&s;ciple, St, <HI>Jobn,</HI> was bani&s;hed and con|fined to <HI>Patmos,</HI> a de&s;olate and uncomfor|table I&s;land: and we read of &s;ome excel|lent men of <HI>whom the World was not worthy, who wandered about in Sheep|&s;kins, and Goats-&s;kins, in de&s;arts, and Dens, and Caves of the Earth, being de&s;|titute, afflicted, tormented;</HI> and yet they would not <HI>accept deliverance</HI> upon &s;inful terms, becau&s;e they fixed their hearts on the hope of <HI>Heavenly enjoyments.</HI> Heb. (11. 37. 38.) It ought therefore to be your care to acquit your &s;elf, as they did, in every point of Chri&s;tian duty, with all good con&s;cience; that you, with them, may partake of that <HI>Re&s;t which remaineth to the People of God.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="12">
<P>And upon the whole, as you would per|form any of the foregoing Duties in an acceptable manner, or injoy any of the&s;e great Ble&s;&s;ings relating to this or the other world, you <HI>mu&s;t be much in</HI> Prayer and ear|ne&s;t devotion to God, the <HI>giver of all Grace,</HI> who <HI>will be found of &s;uch as truly &s;eek his face,</HI> thro' his beloved Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our only <HI>mediator</HI> and <HI>Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>And if it &s;hall plea&s;e his <HI>infinite</HI> good|ne&s;s to re&s;tore you to your former Liberty and <HI>Enjoyments;</HI> be &s;ure to live in per|petual thankfulne&s;s for &s;uch a &s;ingular mercy, duely an&s;wering the ends of it by a &s;erious and truly Chri&s;tian Life. For, if your temporal Liberty when obtained, &s;hould become an occa&s;ion of your &s;ink|ing under the &s;lavery of &s;inful <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> and Pa&s;&s;ions; it were infinitly better that you remained all your days under the mo&s;t bitter and di&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olate Thraldom in this world: becau&s;e no chains on Earth can &s;it &s;o heavy as tho&s;e of eternal Darkne&s;s werewith the Devil is bound, and where|withall he &s;eeks to load us. Labour there|fore, my Brother, to obtain &s;uch firmne&s;s in the ways of God as no Pro&s;perity nor Ad|ver&s;ity may ever &s;hock, And then, if it plea&s;e God to &s;et you free, lift up&punc; your devout Soul to God with great fervency and &s;ay.</P>
