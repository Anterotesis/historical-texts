<HEAD>To His Grace His Maje&s;ty's High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Right Honourable the E&s;tates of Parliament.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>The humble Repre&s;entation and Petition of the Council-General of the Company of</HI> Scotland, <HI>Trading to</HI> Africa <HI>and the</HI> Indies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Grace, and Right Honourable E&s;tates,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is evident by the whole Strain of Three &s;everal Acts of Parliament, together with His Maje&s;ty's Let|ters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kngdom, in favours of the &s;aid Company, That the Wi&s;dom of the King and Right Honourable E&s;tates did intend, that all &s;uch Advantages as might ari&s;e by the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;uch a Company, &s;hould be of as univer&s;ally a National Concern as po&s;&s;ible; And in or|der thereunto, were plea&s;ed to endow it with large Priviledges and Immunities, &s;uteable to the Circum|&s;tances of an Infant-Company, and the Greatne&s;s of its De&s;igns: And le&s;t that it &s;hould fail in the Exe|cution, for want of a &s;ufficient Stock to carry on &s;uch an Undertaking, all imaginable Parliamentary Encou|ragement was given to Per&s;ons of all Ranks, Ages and Sexes, both within and without the Kingdom, whe|ther Natives or Foreigners, to become Partners and Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of the &s;aid Company, as is &s;ingularly manife&s;t by the 42d. Act of the 5th Se&s;&s;ion of this current Parliament, &s;pecially calculated for that end only.</P>
<P>Upon the publick Faith of having due Protection in the enjoyment of the&s;e unque&s;tionable Priviledges and Immunities, as having received their Sanction from His Maje&s;ty, and the unanimous Suffrage of the Great Council of the Nation as afore&s;aid, many Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Degrees were thereby induced to become Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of our &s;aid Company, in &s;o much that in a very &s;hort time, a much more con&s;iderable Stock was &s;ub&s;crib'd for within this Kingdom, than was ever before &s;o much as propos'd here upon any Project what&s;oever, &s;ince we were a Nation.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ing thus entred into a Society, We and our Con&s;tituents have pur&s;uant to the intentions of the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above-mention'd, with much care and trouble, and a great Expen&s;e of Trea&s;ure, after having &s;truggled with many unexpected Ob&s;tructions and Difficulties, &s;etled a Plantation, by the Name of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> in one of the mo&s;t Healthful, Fruitful, naturally impregnable, and every way valuable Places in all <HI>America,</HI> as is univer&s;ally acknowledged by all Per&s;ons of Experience in &s;uch Matters, as well as by the General Con&s;ent of &s;uch as have been there: And, as a manife&s;t proof thereof, tho' our &s;aid Plantation be &s;ettled mo&s;t &s;trictly in the terms of the Acts of Parliament and Letters patent above mentioned, yet it has rai&s;ed the Jealou&s;y of &s;ome, and Envy of others, of the mo&s;t knowing and con&s;iderable Trading Nations it <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But, to our and the Nations great Surpri&s;e, and ine&s;timable Lo&s;s, while we were u&s;ing all ordinary means and big with the hopes of riveting that Settlement upon a la&s;ting Foundation, &s;uch was the further continu|ed Chain of unexpected Ob&s;tructions and mo&s;t unaccountable Mal-treatments that we met with, by Procla|mations of a very &s;trange Nature, and otherways, that the repeated Misfortunes following thereupon, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> us under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity of humbly petitioning His Maje&s;ty for allowing the Parliament to mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the day appointed in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t; in full confidence and Expectation of having the mo&s;t natural and cordial A&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed our Company, and promi&s;ed it Protection; e&s;peciall &s;ince all our other Applications have hitherto proved ineffectual: But a meeting of the E&s;tates in Parlia|ment at that time not quadrating (it would &s;eem) with His Maje&s;ty's other Affairs, a very con&s;iderable Bo|dy of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burge&s;&s;es of this Kingdom, thought fit, in a mo&s;t dutiful and humble ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|ner, by their late Addre&s;s, to repre&s;ent to His Maje&s;ty, how deeply they were affected with the Nation concern in our Company's repeated Misfortunes, and therefore humbly Petitioned for the &s;itting of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Parliament as &s;oon as conveniently might be.

<P>The fir&s;t attempt for &s;trengthning our Company's Intere&s;t and Stock was at <HI>London,</HI> where a Sub&s;cripti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> of 300000 <HI>sterl.</HI> was procured in Nine days time, without &s;o much as a publick Adverti&s;ement, and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> knowing Merchants were &s;o far convinc'd of the many Advantages that might probably ari&s;e from &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Con&s;titution, that they &s;ignified their willingne&s;s to be concerned for Triple the Sum, if allowed: I not only did the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> by their Addre&s;s to His Maje&s;ty of the 13th of <HI>December</HI> 1695. a otherways, render that Sub&s;cription ineffectual, but the Hou&s;e of Commons did al&s;o appoint a Committ <HI>to examine what Methods were taken for obtaining the Act of Parliament, by which our &s;aid Company is e&s;tabli&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> who were the Promoters and Advi&s;ers thereof;</HI> and did afterwards impeach the Nominees in the &s;aid Act Parliament; notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;olute Independency of this Kingdom:</P>
<P>Yet after all this Di&s;couragement, we went on with our Sub&s;criptions at home, and made our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Effort for &s;trengthning thereof beyond Sea, both in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> In the fir&s;t of which pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> many eminent Merchants declared their po&s;itive inclinations to be very con&s;iderably intere&s;ted with us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> gave &s;ome &s;ignal Proofs thereof, till they were made to under&s;tand by Threatnings and other In&s;inuati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> that a Higher Power would make them at lea&s;t very unea&s;y, if they per&s;i&s;ted any further in their Re&s;oluti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> of being concerned with our Company.</P>

<P>And at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where we had the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Hopes of foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Commercii</HI> or Mer|chant-Company, entred into Contract with our Company's Deputees, to joyn at lea&s;t 200000 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sterl:</HI> to our Company's Stock; but to our great A&s;toni&s;hment, His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britains</HI> Mini&s;ters there, did, under pretence of &s;pecial Warrant from the King, put a full &s;top thereto, by giving in <HI>A Memorial to the Burgo-Ma&s;ters and Gentlemen-Councellours of that City, wholly di&s;-owning the Authority of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Pa|tent above-mention'd, and intimating that His Maje&s;ty would regard their entring into Treaties with our Company as an Affront to His Royal Authority, and that he would not fail to re&s;ent it, as having neither Credential Letters, nor being any otherways Authoriz'd by His Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Upon notice whereof, we did in all humble Duty Addre&s;s His Maje&s;ty in <HI>June</HI> 1697, for Redre&s;s of that open and bold Encroachment, upon not only our, but al&s;o the Nation's Rights, in its mo&s;t fundamental Con|&s;titution, by endeavouring to &s;ubvert the Independency of its Parliamentary Laws, expre&s;ly contrary to the Law of Nations: All which His Maje&s;ty by His Royal Letter from <HI>Flanders</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1697, <HI>Promi&s;ed to take into Con&s;ideration, as &s;oon as he would return into</HI> England, <HI>and that in the mean time, His Maje&s;ty would give Orders to His Mi|ni&s;ters at</HI> Hamburgh, <HI>not to ob&s;truct our Company in the pro&s;ecution of its Trade with the Inhabitants of that City.</HI></P>
<P>In the full Confidence of His Maje&s;ty's Royal Promi&s;e, we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure, and took our Mea|&s;ures accordingly, till to our further &s;urprize, we found by &s;everal In&s;tances, that His Maje&s;ty's &s;aid Mini&s;ters were as wickedly bent again&s;t us as ever, and &s;till denying that they had got any &s;uch Orders from His Maje|&s;ty: whereupon the Directors of our Company, did, by their Letter of the 28 of <HI>September</HI> 1697, expo&s;tulate in the fir&s;t place, with both the then Secretaries of State, about that further Di&s;-appointment, but having &s;till no Redre&s;s therein, we did in mo&s;t humble and dutiful Manner, by our &s;econd Addre&s;s of the 22d. day of <HI>December</HI> 1697. lay the whole Matter again before His Maje&s;ty; And did likewi&s;e, at the &s;ame time, not only humbly Repre&s;ent the Premi&s;&s;es to His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy-Council, together with the train of ill Con&s;equences that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly attend &s;uch Treatment, if not prevented by an early Redre&s;s; but wrote al&s;o &s;eparatly to both the Secretaries of State, and &s;uch other Noble Per&s;ons of the Government, as happen'd to be then at <HI>London,</HI> To u&s;e their Joint-Intere&s;t, for procuring Ju&s;tice, in a Matter of &s;uch Uni|ver&s;al Concern to the Honour, Intere&s;t, and Independency of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>All the An&s;wer we obtain'd, was by a Letter of the 17th of <HI>January.</HI> 1698, from both the Secretaries of State: <HI>That the King &s;aid, He had already given Orders to His Re&s;ident at</HI> Hamburgh <HI>in that Matter, conform to His Royal Letter from</HI> Flanders, <HI>in</HI> July 1697, <HI>which was then communicated to the Company.</HI></P>
<P>By which An&s;wer, together with what repeated Advices we had at the &s;ame time from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters there, had &s;till po&s;itively di&s;owned their having got any &s;uch Orders, we were put out of all Hopes of having any Redre&s;s, until we &s;hould have an Opportunity of laying the whole Matter before a Meeting of the E&s;tates of Parliament.</P>
<P>But in the mean time we proceeded, with all the Strength we had (tho' extremely weakned by the Treat|nent above-narrated) to make the be&s;t Preparations we could (con&s;idering the Scarcity of the&s;e Years) for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tting out an Equipage of Ships, Men, Provi&s;ions, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for &s;ettling a Plantation in <HI>Ame|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ica,</HI> in the Terms of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent above-mention'd: And its evident by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ery Con&s;titutions of the Colony, that they were calculated more for the general Advantage of the Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Po&s;terity, than for the particular and immediat Benefit of the Adventurers.</P>
<P>And the Parliament happening to meet the very next Day after our Ships had &s;ail'd, we did, by our Hum|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">le Petition of the 22d. of <HI>July</HI> 1698, Repre&s;ent to his Grace, His Maje&s;ties then High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e Right Honourable E&s;tates then a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, the Treatment which our Company met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> as afore&s;aid, the great Prejudices which we had &s;u&s;tain'd thereby, and the many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rther Inconveniencies and evil Con&s;equences that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly have followed thereupon, if, upon any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ccount what&s;oever, the Parliament &s;hould happen to neglect the taking immediat Cognizance of &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;age.</P>

<P>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 13th. of <HI>December</HI> 1698, returned for An&s;wer, <HI>That he would take the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">enient Opportunity he could have, to repre&s;ent that Matter to the King, but that he could not expect to have it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> time, becau&s;e His Maje&s;ty was then very much imployed in the Affairs of His</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">he Secretary, by his Letter of the 7th. of <HI>February</HI> 1699, &s;ignified, <HI>That he had pre&s;ented our Company's Peti|to His Maje&s;ty, and was commanded to let us know, that there being Accounts, that the Ships belonging to the Com|pany,
<PB N="3" REF="3">were arriv'd upon the Coa&s;t of</HI> America, <HI>and the particular De&s;ign not being communicated to His Maje&s;ty, He there|fore delayed to give any An&s;wer, until he &s;hould receive certain Information of their Settlement.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' we could not but be &s;urpriz'd, to find all our former Addre&s;&s;es and Petitions, about Matters of &s;uch weighty Concern, as are above narrated, An&s;wered, after &s;o long Delays, only with a &s;eeming Charge, for not having communicated to His Maje&s;ty a thing that was never in the lea&s;t demanded of us, by either the King, Parliament, Privy Council, or Mini&s;ters of State, we being limited to &s;ettle in the Terms of the Acts of Parlia|ment, as we &s;hould be An&s;werable: Yet upon the very fir&s;t Advice we had of our Colony's Settlement in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> we, by our Letters of the 31&s;t. of <HI>March,</HI> and 1&s;t. of <HI>April</HI> 1699, gave a very full and dutiful Account thereof to His Maje&s;ty, and to both the Secretaries of State, together with an Account of the <HI>French</HI> De&s;igns thereabouts, and of what Import our &s;aid Settlement (if duly protected) might prove to the Intere&s;t and Security of all His Maje&s;ties Dominions, and referred the &s;ame, together with the Contents of our for|mer Petitions, to His Maje&s;ties Royal Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>About this time it was, That His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to call the Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ion, and the Ad|vocat to Court, to the end (as we under&s;tood) that they, jointly with both the Secretaries of State, might, in a Conference with &s;everal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, &s;atisfy His Maje&s;ty, as to the Legality of our Com|pany's Settlement: Which (by all that ever we could learn) was then (and otherways &s;ince that time) made clear beyond all manner of Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>But while, in the mean time, we were pawning even our own particular Credits, for &s;ending the needful Supplies of Ships, Men, Provi&s;ions, Arms, Ammunition, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for &s;ecuring &s;o valuable a Settlement to this Nation, we were a&s;toni&s;hed to have Advice, That, by Orders from <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1699, Proclamations had been emitted, in the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> over all His Maje&s;ties Planta|tions and Territories in <HI>America,</HI> &s;trictly Intercommuning our Colony, under very &s;evere Penalties to be inflicted on the Contraveeners of the&s;e Proclamations, <HI>in regard that His Maje&s;ty</HI> (as the&s;e Proclamations narrate) <HI>was unacquainted with the Intentions and De&s;igns of the</HI> Scots <HI>&s;ettling at</HI> Darien.</P>
<P>As we humbly con&s;idered the&s;e Proclamations to be &s;uch, as were never before publi&s;hed in tho&s;e parts, again&s;t any other People upon Earth, and of &s;o Barbarous a Nature, as we thought, no Good Chri&s;tians would put in Execution even again&s;t Infidels; So finding our &s;elves unque&s;tionably warranted by all Laws Humane and Divine, we per&s;i&s;ted in our Endeavours for maintaining that Settlement, as hoping, that, through means thereof, this Nation might, in time, have an Opportunity of rai&s;ing it &s;elf above the open Con|tempt, Reproach and In&s;ults of its unkind Neighbours, and of propagating the Go&s;pel among&s;t the Igno|rant good Natur'd <HI>Indians</HI> of tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>But before our Recruits could po&s;&s;ibly arrive at <HI>Caledonia,</HI> our Colony got certain Accounts of the&s;e Pro|clamations; and finding at the &s;ame time, the &s;ad Effects thereof, by being denied any the lea&s;t Help, ei|ther for Goods or Money, at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> from whence they had formerly Supplies; And that in the Pro|clamation i&s;&s;ued by Sir <HI>William Bee&s;ton,</HI> Governour of that I&s;land, he had po&s;itively declared, <HI>That by their Settlement in</HI> Darien, <HI>they had actually broken the Peace entred into with His Majesties Allyes</HI> (which they believed he dur&s;t not venture to have done without a &s;ufficient Warrant) And finding them&s;elves thereby to be of con&s;e|quence declared Pirates, without any previous Summons or Hearing, contrary to the Cu&s;toms and com|mon U&s;age of all Nations, even in the ca&s;e of real Piracy; and founding a Belief, at the &s;ame time, on the Treatment which they knew our Company had formerly met with in <HI>Europe,</HI> without being Redre&s;s'd therein, that we were not in a Condition either to &s;upply or protect them, they unhappily took the Alarm, under &s;uch a General Con&s;ternation, as deve&s;ted them not only of all manner of patience to &s;truggle with any Inconveniencies they lay under at the time, but al&s;o of all manner of prudence, in taking any rea&s;on|able Mea&s;ures either for their own Security, or for our Company's intere&s;t. In the mid&s;t of which Con|fu&s;ion tho&s;e of them who had any bad De&s;igns (as we could not well &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Number to be free of &s;ome) made u&s;e of the&s;e Proclamations as handles, by which to perpetrate their own &s;everal ends, and ea&s;ily per&s;waded all the re&s;t to leave the Settlement: Which they unadvi&s;edly did the 20th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t. And by that means not only have the Ships, Men &amp; Goods, which were there at that time, been expo&s;ed to the Ar|bitrary will of tho&s;e to whom the Execution of tho&s;e Proclamations was given in Charge, but even all our &s;ub&s;equent Mea&s;ures brought into inevitable di&s;order.</P>
<P>Upon Information of all which, we did, by our humble Petition to His Maje&s;ty of the 19th of <HI>October</HI> 1699, in all humility and earne&s;tne&s;s, beg, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty would in His Fatherly care for the good of our Com|pany in particular, and of the Nation in General, be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give &s;ome &s;pecial Te&s;timonies of his Majestys Royal Protection to our Company at that Juncture, and particularly to take off the Force and effect of tho&s;e Proclamations which have been &s;o prejudicial to us, and to &s;ignify his Royal plea&s;ure to the Governours of hit Plantations in</HI> America, <HI>that our Colony might be &s;upplied in the common and ordinary way of Commerce as tho&s;e of other Nations are; And that in the mean time His Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow the E&s;tates of Parliament to meet at the day appointed in</HI> November <HI>la&s;t, or as &s;oon as conveniently could be, to the end that their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance might he had in &s;uch a weighty and General Concern.</HI></P>
<P>We likewi&s;e, by our humble Addre&s;s to His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council of the 20th of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> 1699, Repre&s;ented what we thought in duty and prudence nece&s;&s;ary, with relation to the Contents of our &s;aid Petition to his Maje&s;ty, <HI>Humbly referring the whole to their Lord&s;hips mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, and praying that they would be plea&s;ed to do us all the good Offices with His Maje&s;ty that they'd think mo&s;t expedient for &s;upporting our Company and Colonys Interest; and to give him an account of our Company's hard Circumstances, and how much the Ho|nour and Intere&s;t of the Nation &s;tood concern'd therein.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by His Royal Letter to us of the 2d. of <HI>November</HI> 1699, to declare that, <HI>He did very much regret the Lo&s;s which the Kingdom &amp; the Company had lately &s;u&s;tain'd, That he would upon all occa&s;ions protect and encourage the Trade of the Nation, That he would take care that His Subjects of this Kingdom &s;hould have the &s;ame freedom of Trade and Commerce with his</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Plantations that ever they had formerly, and that he would order the Parliament to meet, when he'd judge that the Good of the Nation would require it.</HI></P>
<P>But, in &s;ome &s;hort time thereafter, while we were &s;olacing our &s;elves with the Hopes of having His Maje&s;ty's protection, not only as a Company e&s;tabli&s;hed by His Royal Authority, with the Advice and Con&s;ent of Par|liament, but al&s;o as Subjects, and making all the Preparations we could, to &s;end the needful Supplies and Advices to tho&s;e who were la&s;t &s;ent for Repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Settlement: We were further a&s;toni&s;hed to have Ad|vices

And that in com|plyance with the intent of the&s;e Proclamations, Our People that went along with the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun,</HI> were in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, po&s;itively denyed Wood and Water at <HI>Mon&s;erat,</HI> a Priviledge never before denyed to any o|ther Nation: And by a Letter of the 29th. of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t from the Commander of another of our Compa|ny's Ships, we are a&s;&s;ured that they were po&s;itively denyed Anchoring at St. <HI>Christophers</HI> by the Governour Colonel <HI>Norton,</HI> who out of his own Mouth declared to the Commander of our &s;aid Ship, That he did it by new Orders which he had received about a Month before; altho at the &s;ame time two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were then Watering there; which we have &s;ince confirmed to us by Letters from Mr. <HI>Daniel Mackay,</HI> one of the Councellours of our Colony, dated at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> the 13th. <HI>February</HI> la&s;t: By which Letters, he informs us likewi&s;e, That when he waited upon the Governour of that I&s;land, concerning our Company's Ship the St. <HI>Andrew</HI> lying in that Harbour, The Governour declared to him, That tho' the &s;aid Ship were fitted for going to Sea, he would not &s;uffer her to go, without a &s;pecial Order from <HI>England</HI> for that Effect.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e humbly beg leave to inform Your Grace, and Right Honourable E&s;tates, That among&s;t our Company's many other Lo&s;&s;es and Mi&s;-fortunes, a Ship called the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> ladned with a valuable Cargo, belonging to our Company, &s;truck Unfortunatly on a Rock, by which &s;he &s;prung a Leake, and being forc'd to run a&s;hoar under the Walls of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> to e&s;cape Ship-wrack, the &s;aid Ship and Goods were by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (His Maje&s;ty's Allies) violently &s;eized and di&s;po&s;ed of as Prize, and the Men al&s;o to the Num|ber of 30 and a Boy, detain'd and made clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, not only contrary to the Law of Nations, (we being then in profound Peace with them) but al&s;o contrary to the expre&s;s Terms of the 10. and 11.

<P>In An&s;wer to which, His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by His Royal Letter of the 10th. of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t to &s;ignify, <HI>That He was re&s;olved in the Terms of the Treaties to demand from the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>that the&s;e Pri&s;oner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty.</HI></P>
