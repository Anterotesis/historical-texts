<P>This Province was heretofore governed by Earls, which did Homage to the King of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> as did al&s;o <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> after that <HI>Flanders</HI> was fallen to him by marrying <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Lewis Malatin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> in 1369. pa&s;&s;ing afterwards into the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter and Heire&s;s of <HI>Charle les hardy</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to <HI>Maxi|milian</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany.

But af|terwards in King <HI>Philip</HI> II's time, it was extreamly curtail'd and harra&s;s'd, which made many of the inhabitants retire in|to <HI>England,</HI> and this did not only depopulate it, but impove|ri&s;h'd it con&s;iderably, by carrying away a great part of its Trade. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> revolting at the &s;ame time, added to its Calamities by a War of 40 years continuance, and the <HI>French</HI> have of late made great Deva&s;tations in it.</P>

<P>I. <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GHent</HI> or <HI>Gaunt,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Gandae aut Ganda|vum aut Gandavium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gand.</NOTE> is one of the large&s;t Cities in Europe, being &s;even Miles in compa&s;s within the Walls. They give out, that it was founded by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in a very Commodious place for Trading, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Confluent of four con&s;iderable Rivers, (the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Lys,</HI> the <HI>Moer,</HI> and the <HI>Leye</HI>) which run through it, and di|vide it into 26 I&s;lands which are joined together with as ma|ny great Bridges, and 72 little ones. It is well Walled and Trenched about, and the private Buildings for the mo&s;t part fair and &s;tately. There are a great many Water and Wind-Mills; Seven Churches, and 55 Mona&s;teries or Ho&s;pitals. Several Market-places, of which that of <HI>Fryday</HI>'s has no equal in Europe. The Ca&s;tle, which is the Princes Palace, con|tains
<PB N="11" REF="8"> as many Rooms as there are Days in the Year, there the Wooden Cradle of <HI>Charles</HI> V. is &s;till to be &s;een. The Cathedral is a mo&s;t Magnificent Building, and the Tow|er <HI>Bell-fort</HI> is above 400 &s;teps high. The Town-hou&s;e is al|&s;o worth taking notice of. The Cittadel con&s;i&s;ts of four re|gular Ba&s;tions, but it lies not &s;o very convenient as many others in the&s;e parts. This City is the &s;eat of the Parliament or Provincial Court of <HI>Flanders;</HI> yet one may appeal from it to that of <HI>Mechlin,</HI> which judges without further appeal. The Trade of this City con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in Cloths, Stuffs and Silks of which there are &s;o great quantity made, that among the 50 Companies of Trade&s;men, tho&s;e relating to Commo|dities of this Nature make one third. It &s;tands about twelve Miles from the Sea; 27 miles South We&s;t of <HI>Antwerp;</HI> 30 North We&s;t of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> 94 South of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> 154 North Ea&s;t of <HI>Paris,</HI> and 160 Ea&s;t of <HI>London;</HI> Long. 22 d. 58 m. Lat. 51. d. 6. m.</P>
<P>Fifty thou&s;and Inhabitants of this City, under the Stan|dard of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> have formerly been formidable to the neigh|bouring States, and their Princes them&s;elves, in the Reigns of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> VI. Kings of <HI>France.</HI> In 1539. they revolted from the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. and would have put them&s;elves under the protection of <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> who not only refu&s;ed their offer, but gave the Empe|ror free pa&s;&s;age thro' his Dominions into the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> The Emperor having reduced them to obedience, put to Death 30 of the principal Burge&s;&s;es, and bani&s;h'd a great number; took from them their Artillery, Arms, and Privi|ledges, and built a Cittadel to curb them for the future.</P>
<P>This City was inve&s;ted by the <HI>French</HI> King's orders the fir&s;t of <HI>March</HI> 1678. On the fourth the King in Per&s;on came be|fore it. The be&s;ieged to no purpo&s;e cut their Dikes, and drowned part of the Country, for the King lodged his Forces, and pre&s;&s;ed &s;o vigorou&s;ly the Siege, that on the 9th of the &s;ame month the Town and Cittadel were both carried. It was re&s;tored to the Spaniards about four Months after by the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Bruges.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bruges</HI> or <HI>Bruggen</HI> Lat. <HI>Bruga</HI> and <HI>Brugae,</HI> is &s;cituated in a great Plain within eight or nine miles of the Sea, upon the Canal called <HI>Reye,</HI> which being divided into &s;everal Naviga|ble
<PB N="12" REF="9"> Torrents runs in divers places of the City, and afterwards the&s;e join in the &s;ame Canal which goes to the <HI>Sluce.</HI> But this la&s;t belonging to the Hollanders the Inhabitants of <HI>Bruges</HI> about 40 years ago made a new Canal which goes to <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> that is but about three Leagues from it, and the Tide mount|ing above half way, it bears Ships of 400 Tuns to <HI>Bruges,</HI> which maintains a &s;tanding Trade there. Yet it flouri&s;hed more in former days, before Merchants had bethought of retiring to <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. erected <HI>Bruges</HI> into a Bi&s;hoprick &s;uf|fragant of <HI>Malines</HI> in 1559, and <HI>Peter Curtius</HI> was the fir&s;t Pre|late of it. This is one of the greate&s;t and beautifulle&s;t Ci|ties of <HI>Flanders,</HI> fortified with good Ditches, great Ramparts, and &s;trong Walls. The publick Buildings are very &s;umptuous, the Streets large and &s;trait, with &s;everal fine Places, and chiefly that of the Market, whereat &s;ix great Streets begin that lead in a &s;trait line to the &s;ix principal Gates of the City. There are &s;even Pari&s;h Churches. The Cathedral is that of St. <HI>Do|nat</HI> or <HI>Donatian.</HI> The Provo&s;t of this Collegial Church was born Pre&s;ident in the Court called St. <HI>Donat</HI> and hereditary Chancellor of <HI>Flanders,</HI> but this dignity has been united to the Epi&s;copal Title, and the Bi&s;hop enjoys the priviledge now. Be&s;ides St. <HI>Donat</HI> there are the Collegial Churches of St. <HI>Salvator</HI> and <HI>Our Lady</HI> the Abbies of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Audemburg,</HI> and about 60 Religious Hou&s;es. At the &s;ide of the Cathedral is the Bi&s;hops Palace, and over again&s;t it is a great Market-place, where the Town-hou&s;e is, an ancient Building enriched with Figures, and divers curious pieces of Sculpture. The Ca&s;tle al&s;o de&s;erves to be &s;een. Ju&s;tice is rendred here by &s;ix Magi&s;trates, who all have a particular Juri&s;diction, <HI>viz.</HI> The City, the Frank, the Provo&s;t-&s;hip at pre&s;ent, the Bi&s;hoprick, the Court for Feodal Tenures, <HI>Zizleele</HI> and <HI>Manda&s;che.</HI> There is al&s;o the Water-hou&s;e with an admirable Machin to convey Water into all the quarters of the City. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a great Trade here in Wooll, Silk, Cotton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are a great many Trade&s;men who make Fu&s;tians, Tape&s;tries, Cloths, and Stuffs, of Silk. They are divided into 68 Profe&s;&s;ions. This City had a &s;hare in the troubles of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> during the Civil Wars. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> loo&s;ing <HI>Calais</HI> in 1558 removed the Staple for Wooll to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and that for &s;ome time pre&s;erved it from decaying. <HI>Philip</HI> I. King of <HI>Spain</HI> was born here in 1478. <HI>Bruges</HI> &s;tands 24 miles N. W. of <HI>Ghent</HI> 11. E. of <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> 34. N. E. of <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> 40 W. of <HI>Antwerp</HI> Long. 22 d. 24. m. Lat. 51. d. 17. m.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<P>III. <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O&s;tend</HI> Lat. <HI>O&s;tenda</HI> is a Sea-port Town &s;eated in a Mar&s;h, at the Mouth of the River <HI>Guele,</HI> and among divers Channels; but is chiefly environ'd almo&s;t on all &s;ides by two of the great|e&s;t of them, into which Ships of the greate&s;t bulk may enter with the Tyde: it is very well fortified, having a &s;trong Rampart, a deep Ditch, and eight regular Ba&s;tions, its con|trived &s;o, that the Sea may be let in round the Town for a great &s;pace, which makes it much more &s;trong and defen&s;ible than before, and as it were impregnable. The Spaniards po&s;|&s;e&s;s no other Port in <HI>Flanders</HI> but this and <HI>Newport,</HI> and this being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, they are making the Haven large, and have made a great Work in order to the carrying of their Ships over into that Cut which goes from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> to <HI>Bruges,</HI> out of their Harbour by the means of a very great Lock or recep|tacle of Water which communicates with both.

This City &s;uffered very much during the War between the States and the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> took it from the <HI>&V;nited Provinces July</HI> 18. 1581. <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> be|came Ma&s;ter of it again&s;t in 1590. by a Boat loaden with Turf,
<PB N="26" REF="16"> under which he hid 60 Souldiers, who rendered them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Ca&s;tle, and he afterwards took the City by Ca|pitulation.

This Lo&s;s af|flicted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> extreamly, but they retook it in 1637. and have kept it ever &s;ince. <HI>Breda</HI> is of a Triangular Figure, at each Angle there is a Gate Built with Brick, and the Cur|tins are flanked with Thirteen Ba&s;tions, be&s;ides &s;everal Ca|valeers all mounted with Cannon. <HI>Breda</HI> however is not ve|ry well Built, yet there is a pretty fair Street in it, the Town-hou&s;e and &s;ome other Places indifferent.

Its Fields are plen|tiful in Pa&s;tures, watered by the Rivers of <HI>Aade</HI> and <HI>Mereck,</HI> which being joined enter into the City, and form divers Channels. The Palace of the Ca&s;tle was lately imbelli&s;h'd, and the Fortifications repaired, and new ones made, by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> now King <HI>William</HI> III. of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> (to whom the City and Barony belongs) &s;o that now it is a large Regular City, and is both by Nature and Art thought impreg|nable: Be&s;ides the Ramparts which are all &s;upported by very &s;trong Brick Arches, and rai&s;ed above the Hou&s;es of the Place, there are a great many Outworks, &s;urrounded with double broad Ditches full of Water. <HI>Breda</HI> is 27 Miles N.

<PB N="27" REF="16"> in 1533.) erected it into a Marqui&s;ate; &s;ince that time the <HI>Hollanders</HI> got it after the Death of the Marqui&s;s <HI>De Bergues,</HI> whom the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Parma</HI> had &s;ent into <HI>Spain,</HI> where he was Arre&s;ted, and Died 1567. They have Fortified this Place well and regularly, with a Channel that goes to the Sea, defended by divers Forts: The Buildings of the Town are fair and hand&s;om, and its three Market-places large and capa|cious. Among&s;t the Edifices, the Church of St. <HI>Lambert,</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;es Palace de&s;erve Ob&s;ervation.

Julia Bona.</HI> It is a regular Fortification, the Walls are faced with Brick, and the Ditch which is dry, is pretty broad; but the Counter&s;carp is none of the be&s;t. As for the Town it &s;elf, it is &s;mall and poor, yet remarkable as being the ordinary Re&s;idence of the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who has there a very fine Ca&s;tle, and curious Gardens in the Neigh|bourhood. The Town-Hou&s;e is al&s;o very well built, with divers Paintings, and a Clock with a melodious Chime, after the fa&s;hion of the Country. There are &s;till fine Churches to be &s;een, the principal of which is dedicated to the Holy Martyrs, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius, Florentius</HI> and <HI>Malu&s;ius.</HI> This Town &s;uffer|ed much in the fir&s;t Wars of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and was fiercely attackt partly by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and partly by the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> who carried it at la&s;t by Fa|mine, in 1588. In this City <HI>Frederick</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> cho&s;en in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was Crowned Emperor in 1314. It was in times pa&s;t an Imperial City, but now it is under the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cologne.</HI> In 1673. the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> now King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> having taken <HI>Naerden</HI> and &s;ecured <HI>Holland</HI> by a part of the Army, he marched with the re&s;t into <HI>Germany,</HI> and joined part of the Confederate Troops to Be&s;iege <HI>Bonn</HI> which had been put into the <HI>French</HI> Kings hands, by the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and the taking this Place forced the <HI>French</HI> to withdraw his Forces out of the united <HI>Netherlands.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it again in the beginning of this late War, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having given Troops to Cardinal <HI>Fur&s;temburg</HI> to maintain his pretend|ed Right to the Electorate. It was be&s;ieged in Summer 1689. by the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> who after having almo&s;t ruined it with Bombs, took it by Capitulation. At the la&s;t Siege of this Town, they found a Vault in which there was an Iron Che&s;t, that was full of Medals of Gold, to the value of 100000 Crowns the Metal was Ducat-Gold and the Impre&s;&s;ions

In this Place is al&s;o the Tomb of the Emperor <HI>Otho,</HI> who is &s;aid to have fir&s;t Con&s;tituted the Electors in 1000. Near this City are many Mines, as Lead, Sulphure, Vitriol, Iron, Coal, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> with which they make Bra&s;s, or multiply Copper in their Furnaces. This City is al|&s;o Famous for its hot Baths, which are very much frequented, and exceeding convenient; three of them are within the Walls, and very convenient, the principal is called the Empe|rors Bath; it has Five Bathing Rooms, in one of which <HI>Char|lemaign</HI> u&s;ed to Bath and Swim. The&s;e Baths ri&s;e &s;o hot, that they let them cool 12 Hours before they u&s;e them. There is al&s;o a Fountain of this hot Water, much re&s;orted to, and drunk of in the Summer. A little from this City on the o|ther &s;ide of a Hill, at a Village called <HI>Bor&s;ett,</HI> are many hot Springs on both &s;ides of a little Rivulet, which compo&s;e 28 Baths, who&s;e Springs are hotter than any of the City, and are cool'd 18 Hours before they be u&s;ed. This City &s;uffered much in the late Wars, being taken by the Prote&s;tants, and retaken by <HI>Spinola</HI> in 1614. Several Councils have been held in this City; which is al&s;o famous for a Treaty of Peace con|cluded there betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1668.

Yet <HI>Notwith&s;tand|ing</HI> this precaution they were di&s;covered, apprehended and condemned to be burn'd alive. When they were put to the Torture, they were ask'd what put them upon &s;uch a horri|ble Cruelty. They an&s;wered, it was becau&s;e they were taught by their Ance&s;tors, that the Blood of a Chri&s;tian was a powerful Remedy to &s;top the Blood in <HI>Circumci&s;ion;</HI> Second|ly, becau&s;e it was a Philtre which created Love in tho&s;e that eat Meat &s;teep'd in it, Thirdly, That it did &s;top the over|flowing of the Months and the Hemorrhoids; Fourthly, That it was to ob&s;erve their ancient Cu&s;tom of offering the Blood of a Chri&s;tian to God yearly, adding that the Inhabi|tants of that City, were enjoyned to perform their Sacrifice
<PB N="175" REF="90"> about that time. This Town &s;tands 28 Miles North Ea&s;t of <HI>Presburg,</HI> and 72 almo&s;t N. W. of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> Long. 38 d. 44 m. Lat. 48 d. 44 m.</P>

This Siege is &s;o memorable that 'twill not be ami&s;s to relate &s;ome particulars of it. When <HI>Soliman</HI> came before this Place with 70000 Men, it was neither &s;trong by Nature or Art, but the Courage of the Garri&s;on &s;upplied that defect. There were in it 2000 <HI>Hungarians</HI> and 60 of the chief Nobility, with all their Wives, Children and Moveables. They bound them|&s;elves by Oath to hold to the la&s;t extremity, and put all their Provi&s;ions into publick Magazines, when the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ummon'd them, they &s;hewed them a Coffin from the Battlements, &s;ig|nifying that they would rather dye than &s;urrender. The Town was battered 40 days with 50 Pieces of Cannon, and the <HI>Turks</HI> making three A&s;&s;aults in one Day, were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of 8000 Men. The in&s;tances of the Courage of <HI>Women</HI> during this Siege, are almo&s;t incredible. The <HI>Turks</HI> being &s;o terrified with &s;uch Prodigies of undauntedne&s;s in both Sexes rai&s;ed the Siege, and the Garri&s;on Sallying out, kill'd a great number of them, and took all their Baggage. In 1596. <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of this Place, after having defeated the Forces &s;ent to relieve it; and the Infi|dels,
<PB N="176" REF="91"> contrary to the Capitulation, Murthered the Garri&s;on. From that time <HI>Agria</HI> continued in the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> till it was retaken by the Imperiali&s;ts in 1687. after a Block|ade of three years; during which there died of Hunger and Di&s;ea&s;es above 10000 <HI>Turks.</HI> When the Garri&s;on was forced to Capitulate, The Governour fearing le&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould retaliate, what had been done in 1596, would not &s;urrender till the Emperor &s;ign'd the Articles. Four thou|&s;and Inhabitants went out with the Garri&s;on, 300 &s;taid and demanded Bapti&s;m, and abundance of Chri&s;tian Slaves were relea&s;ed. They left 150 Canons, &s;even Mortars, and &s;ome Provi&s;ions behind them. This City &s;tands 38 Miles N. E. of <HI>Buda</HI> and 50 S. W. of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> Long. 41 d. 5 m.

<HEAD>Relation of the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> from <HI>June 15. 1686.</HI> to <HI>September 2.</HI> in the &s;ame year.</HEAD>
<P>THE 15th of <HI>June</HI> the two Bodies of the Imperial Army advanced equally; Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with the Ca|valry encamped at <HI>Dotkamp,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at <HI>Mo|hatz,</HI> oppo&s;ite to one another, the <HI>Danube</HI> lying betwixt them. The &s;ame day the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Staremberg</HI> arrived at <HI>Moratz</HI> with the Infantry and part of the Baggage of the Army. The 16th Prince <HI>Charles</HI> went to incamp with the Hor&s;e at St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Staremberg</HI> with the Foot at <HI>Do&s;tkam,</HI> and the

They began the &s;ame day to make a Bridge of Boats, as well for the Pa&s;&s;age of the Troops of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as for Communication with the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and afterwards re&s;olved to Attack the Town in four different Places. The fir&s;t at|tack, on the &s;ide of the lower Town was commanded by Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and carried on the by the Imperial Troops. The &s;econd on the &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, by the Elector of <HI>Ba|varia;</HI> The third was carried on by the Troops of <HI>Saxony;</HI> and the fourth by tho&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> under General <HI>Scho|ning.</HI> The 19th Prince <HI>Charles</HI> cau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Army to appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch to the Baths, and there fixed the General Quarter, with &s;ome Regiments of Foot, within a quarter of a Mile of the City. On the 21&s;t the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> marched his Troops over the Bridge, and came to incamp at the foot of the Mount St. <HI>Gerard.</HI> The 22d the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> Grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonick Order, arrived in the Camp with Count <HI>Dunevald.</HI> The next day the Chri&s;tians began to batter the <HI>Wa&s;&s;er&s;tadt,</HI> and having made a &s;ufficient breach they entred it, whil&s;t the Infidels retired into the Upper City. On the 30th the Marque&s;s of <HI>Turlac</HI> arrived in the Camp with the Troops of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and at the &s;ame day arrived al&s;o the Auxiliary Troops of <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Suabia,</HI> and two Compa|nies of <HI>Pa&s;&s;au</HI> and <HI>Ratisbonne.</HI> The 2d of <HI>July</HI> the Troops of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> arrived under the Command of the Mar&s;hal Ge|neral <HI>Schoning.</HI> The 13th the Chri&s;tians mounted and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Breach; but the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;etting Fire to a Furnace, &s;everal Voluntiers of great Note, with a great Number of Soldiers, were killed or wounded. The 23d it was thought fit to &s;ummon the Be&s;ieged. The Count of <HI>Koning&s;eck, Ayde de Camp</HI> General, was &s;ent with an In|terpreter and a Drummer to make the Summons. The Turks came to meet him, and took the Letter which they pre&s;ent|ed to the Commander. There was a Truce of two Hours made on both &s;ides. The Turks brought a Letter wrapped in Scarlet, written by the Governour, in an&s;wer to that of Prince <HI>Charles;</HI> wherein he declared that he was re&s;olved to make a vigorous defence. After this an&s;wer there was great firing made on both &s;ides. The 27th the Chri&s;tians gave a General A&s;&s;ault and became Ma&s;ters of three Towers, at the
<PB N="184" REF="95"> three Quarters of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> of the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Schoning,</HI> and of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The 1&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Be&s;ieg|ed &s;ent two Agas, who offered in the name of the Vi&s;ier of <HI>Buda,</HI> to remit this Place, with all its Dependencies, and what other two Towns the Emperor &s;hould make choice of, if he would make Peace; but as Prince <HI>Charles</HI> was informed, that the Emperor would do nothing but with the con&s;ent of his Allies, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Agas. On the 14th the Turks who came to the relief of <HI>Buda</HI> appeared in Battel Ar|ray; Prince <HI>Charles</HI> fought them, defeated them, took eight Pieces of Canon, and forty Standards with the lo&s;s of 200 Men. The next day, there were found in the Field 2200 dead Bodies of the Infidels. The 22d the <HI>Bavarians</HI> &s;eized on one of the Towers of the Ca&s;tle. The 29th the Succours of the <HI>Turks</HI> made another attempt to enter into the City, but they were repul&s;ed by the Chri&s;tians. The 31&s;t they got advice that the Grand Vi&s;ier was extreamly di&s;atisfied with the two Ba&s;&s;a's who commanded the Troops which the Chri&s;tians had defeated the 29th, and that his Army was but of about 30000 Men. La&s;tly, The 2d of <HI>September</HI> was the General A&s;&s;ault given: The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> accompanied with the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> began it, attacking the Ca&s;tle. A little while after, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> attended by the Prince of <HI>Croy, Newbourg</HI> and <HI>Commerci,</HI> the Generals <HI>Souches, Diepenthal, Scher&s;&s;emberg,</HI> and the chief Voluntiers of the Ar|my, marched to the A&s;&s;ault. After a fierce Combat which la&s;ted an hour, the Governour being killed upon the breach, the Turks lo&s;t Courage, and retired in di&s;order to the foot of a Wall of the Ca&s;tle. The Imperiali&s;ts being entered the City made a terrible Slaughter. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> found a &s;tronger re&s;i&s;tance at the Ca&s;tle; for the Turks who were therein their Retrenchments, not knowing that the City was taken, defended them&s;elves with a great deal of Courage; at la&s;t, being overpowered, they &s;et fire through de&s;pair, to &s;everal places of the City. After a great Ma&s;&s;acre, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> cau&s;ed Quarter to be given to near 2000 Men, who were retired into the Ca&s;tle, whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>Coning&s;eck</HI> carried the &s;ame orders to the Imperiali&s;ts from Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> This they did, becau&s;e the Infi|dels might have defended them&s;elves yet a great while, for they had at their Head, the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> with the Ba&s;&s;a's Lieutenant, the Mufti, and &s;everal other Officers, who were made Pri&s;oners by the <HI>Bavarians.</HI> Mo&s;t of the

<HEAD>Of the Republick of <HI>Ragu&s;i.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>RAgu&s;i,</HI> or <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> is a City and Republick upon the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> with an Archbi&s;hop's See. Some Authors e&s;teem it to be the &s;ame with the Ancient <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> but others will have the Ruins of that City to be on the other &s;ide, in a place called <HI>Ragu&s;i Vecchio.</HI> However it be, this City which the <HI>Selavonians</HI> call <HI>Dobronich,</HI> is very well Built. Its &s;ituation is upon a Rock, &s;o high on one &s;ide and craggy, that 'tis a Covert to it, and on the other &s;ide it &s;tretches
<PB N="221" REF="113"> along a little Tongue of Land where 'tis wa&s;hed by the Sea. Near this City is the Fort of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and a Port.

Moreover, the Gates of the City are never open but for three or four Hours by Day in Summer time, and not above an Hour and a half in Winter.

Civil Matters, at the Commencement of the Suit, are brought before Six of the Senate, from whom there is an Appeal to the College of Thirty, who are no Senators, and if the Decrees be for Sums exceeding 500 Crowns, the Appeals are finally determin'd by the Senate. Their Judicial Proceedings are in <HI>Latin,</HI> but they plead in <HI>Italian,</HI> or the Language of the Country. Criminal Affairs are judged by an Officer, from whom there is an Appeal to a Juri&s;diction compo&s;ed of Six Senators, and if the Sentence be confirm'd there, the Affair is terminated; but if other|wi&s;e, the Senate takes Cognizance thereof, and Judges it.

Demetrius</HI> made it free again, but be|ing refus'd &s;helter there after his defeat in <HI>Phrygia,</HI> he inve&s;t|ed and made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Town after a years Siege.

The Citizens are reckoned Treacherous and Cun|ning, whence comes the Proverb, <HI>From a Jew of</HI> Salonica, <HI>a Greek of</HI> Athens, and <HI>a Turk of</HI> Negropont, Good Lord De|liver us. They &s;peak <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and differ only in Habit, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> wear clo&s;er on their Bodies. Their Women &s;eldom &s;tir abroad, when they do, they cover their Heads with a Veil of Calico, and throw over 'em a large Crim&s;on Velvet or Violet colour'd Mantle with their Silver Cla&s;ps. The Maids never go abroad till their Wedding-Day, being courted by Proxies. Upon their Nup|tials they wear a large Crown of Filigram and Pearls, and are led from Church to the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e, with Hautboys, Drums and other Mu&s;ical In&s;truments playing before them. The Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Athens</HI> is not worth above 4000 Crowns a year; wherefore mo&s;t of the Je&s;uits are retired to <HI>Negro|pont.</HI> But the Con&s;uls of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> keep each of 'em a Chappel here.

<P><HI>MOdon,</HI> called by the <HI>Turks, Mutum,</HI> anciently <HI>Methone,</HI> is in that part of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> formerly called <HI>Me&s;&s;enia:</HI> It is a &s;trong, rich and trading City, with a Bi&s;hop's See under the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Patras.</HI> Its Seat is very advantagious, being upon a Cape of the Sea of <HI>Sapienza,</HI> at the Foot of which is a fair and good Port. This City was the ordinary Re&s;idence of the Sangiac or Governour of <HI>Morea</HI> for the Grand <HI>Seignior.</HI> It has at &s;everal times undergone &s;everal Revolu|tions. The Emperor <HI>Trajanus</HI> granted it great Priviledges, which were confirmed upon it by <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great.</HI> In 1124. the <HI>Venetians</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, under the Doge <HI>Domenico Michiole,</HI> but the Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> retook it the next Year after. In 1204. upon the Divi&s;ion of the Em|pire it fell again into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom it was taken by <HI>Leo Veteran</HI> a famous Pyrate of <HI>Genoa.</HI> This U&s;urper did not enjoy it long, for being taken in the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> he was brought to <HI>Corfu,</HI> where he &s;uffered an Ignominious Death, which &s;o frighted his Party, that the Captains <HI>Dandolo</HI> and <HI>Promalino</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Modon</HI> without any oppo&s;ition. In 1498. <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. laid Siege to it with an Army of 150000 Men, and took it after a &s;harp Battel with the Army of the <HI>Venetians.</HI> which came to relieve it. In 1659. <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> General took it from the <HI>Turks,</HI> but they regained it in the end of the <HI>Candi|an</HI> War. In 1686. the <HI>Venetian</HI> Arms again prevailed to de|liver this noble and &s;trong City out of the Hands of the Infi|dels.

This City has had &s;everal Ma&s;ters. <HI>Baudrand</HI> thinks that it was yielded to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by the De&s;potes Princes of <HI>Morea;</HI> but <HI>Verdizzotti</HI> a&s;&s;ures us that they never had it before the Divi&s;ion of the Ea&s;tern Empire. In 1204. it was &s;urprized by <HI>Leo Veteran</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Pyrate; but after he had been Executed at <HI>Corfu, Coron</HI> returned to its Lawful Ma&s;ters the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom it was taken by the formidable Army of <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. in 1498.

Its Soil is very fruitful in Grapes, of which is made the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Wine in all <HI>Greece,</HI> and &s;o much fam'd through all the World: It yields al&s;o as much Corn as &s;erves to maintain 60 Per&s;ons, which con&s;idering the natural &s;trength of the Place, are enough for a Garri&s;on.

Its Situation is &s;o ad|vantageous, that it is called by &s;ome the Eye, and the Bulwark of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> The Romans upon pretence of an affront offered to their Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent the Con&s;ul L. <HI>Mamius</HI> who burn'd and pillaged this City <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> 3818. but by the Care and Magnificence of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> it recovered its former Beauty and Riches. Since that time it has often felt the fury of War, e&s;pecially under <HI>Amurath</HI> II. and <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Son, &s;o that it has now but the mi&s;erable ruins of its former Great|ne&s;s, and 20 or 30 Hou&s;es or rather Cottages, it is &s;ubject to the <HI>Venetias</HI> &s;ince 1687.</P>

He has two Coun&s;ellors under him, and the Place of all three, la&s;ts two years. The Ca&s;tle is built on a Hill that commands all the I&s;land; at the foot of the Town, which &s;tretches along the Sea &s;ide the &s;pace of two Miles. They make there va&s;t quantities of Rai&s;ins, &s;trong racy Wines, and mo&s;t excellent Oyls, to the value of 50000 Ducats <HI>per An.</HI></P>

This I&s;land is &s;ubject to frequent Earth-quakes which is the rea&s;on, why they built their Hou&s;es generally but one Story high. There are in this I&s;land &s;everal <HI>Greek</HI> Churches and Religious Hou&s;es to the number of 44. under the Government of a Bi&s;hop, who is to be cho&s;en by the <HI>Greek</HI> Curates of all the I&s;land.

It is generally thought that the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t 5 or 600000 Men at that Siege, which expo&s;ed their Government to Rebellions often begun at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> In 1692. the <HI>Venetians</HI> endea|voured to regain <HI>Candia,</HI> but were forced to abandon the En|terprize with con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Article III.</HI> I&s;lands in the <HI>Mare Egeo,</HI> or <HI>Archipelago.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are in this Sea a great many I&s;lands, of which there are but three worth taking notice of, <HI>viz. Egena, Culu|ri,</HI> and <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>Egena.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Egena,</HI> lyes about 15 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles from the Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>Athens,</HI> 10 of <HI>Culuri,</HI> and 12 of <HI>Morea.</HI> It is called <HI>Egina</HI> by <HI>Strabo, Aenone</HI> by <HI>Baudrand, Myrmidonia</HI> by <HI>Brietius,</HI> and <HI>Engi</HI> by the Mariners. It is 30 Miles in Compa&s;s, but has no Harbour for Ships. Partridges multiply here to that degree that the Inhabitants are u&s;ed to &s;earch their Ne&s;ts, and de|&s;troy their Eggs in the Spring, to prevent the prejudice &s;o great a quantity of Fowl might cau&s;e to their Seeds.</P>
<P>There are here two fine Monuments of Antiquity; the fir&s;t is a Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> towards the North of the I&s;land; the &s;econd is another Temple Dedicated to <HI>Jupiter</HI> by <HI>Aeacus</HI> fir&s;t King of this I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Town which bears the Name of the I&s;land, was for|merly dignify'd with the Title of a Bi&s;hoprick Suffragan of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Athens,</HI> and famous for the Birth of <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Medicis;</HI> but it is now reduced to a Mi&s;erable Borough joined to the Fortre&s;s, which is only remarkable for the Advantages of its &s;ituation, upon a high craggy Rock, which over-looks &s;everal I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land was formerly &s;ubject to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but &s;ince the time that <HI>Frederick Barbero&s;&s;a</HI> took it from them, it was become a Receptacle of Banditto's and Pyrates. In 1674. <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> forced them to Surrender at Di&s;cretion, and having pillag'd and demoli&s;hed the Town, he cau&s;ed 300 <HI>Greeks,</HI> and 40 <HI>Turks</HI> to be Chain'd in order to Row upon the Gal|lies of the Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<PB N="271" REF="138">
<P>II. <HI>Culuri.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land was called by the Ancients <HI>Salamis,</HI> and is known to the Mariners under the Name of <HI>Santa Bur&s;ia,</HI> and under that of <HI>Cychria, Scyrar,</HI> and <HI>Pityu&s;&s;a</HI> to <HI>Baudrand.</HI> It has a Village which bears its Name, &s;eated on the mo&s;t Sou|thern part of this I&s;land, with about 200 Hou&s;es in it, and an Harbour, which according to Mr. <HI>Spon</HI>'s Travels, is one of the large&s;t in the World, being Seven Miles long, and Two broad. This I&s;land lyes about 10 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles from <HI>Egena,</HI> 2 from <HI>Attica,</HI> and is about 35 in Compa&s;s. It has about a Thou&s;and Inhabitants; and abounds with Corn, Ro&s;in, Pit|coal, and Spunges, which the Inhabitants Tran&s;port to <HI>A|thens.</HI> Over-again&s;t the Coa&s;t of <HI>Athens,</HI> there is a &s;mall Bo|rough of 20 Hou&s;es, called <HI>Ambelachi,</HI> with a little Harbour; four or five Miles from this Village, was the Ancient City of <HI>Salimene,</HI> a Bi&s;hop's See under the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Negropont,</HI> is an I&s;land of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> &s;eparated from <HI>Achaia</HI> by <HI>Euripus.</HI> It was of old called <HI>Eubaea</HI> and <HI>Chalcis;</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Egribos,</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>Egripos.</HI> Some Authors tell us, that this I&s;land formerly was part of <HI>Baeotia,</HI> a Province of <HI>Achaia,</HI> from whence it was &s;eparated by an Earthquake. It is 365 Miles in Compa&s;s, 90 in length from S. to N. and 40 in breadth. Its two mo&s;t noted Capes are <HI>Cabo Figera,</HI> or <HI>Cabo d'Oro,</HI> (formerly called <HI>Caphareus</HI>) and <HI>Cabo Lithar.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land is very fruitful, and abounds in all Provi&s;ions. There is the Mountain of <HI>Cari&s;to,</HI> famous for its excellent Marble, and the Stone <HI>Amiantos</HI> or <HI>Asbe&s;tos,</HI> whereof they make a kind of Linnen, which is made clean by ca&s;ting it in|to the Fire, as being incombu&s;tible. This I&s;land produces Cotton enough to furni&s;h Sails for a whole Fleet. There are two Rivers in it, <HI>Similio</HI> and <HI>Cereo;</HI> the fir&s;t of which makes the Fleeces of the Sheep white, and the other makes them black, if the Poets may be credited.</P>
<P>The Governour of this I&s;le is now a Captain <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who has the Command al&s;o of <HI>Achaia.</HI> During the Government of
<PB N="272" REF="139"> Doge <HI>Pietro Ziani,</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> be&s;towed this I&s;land upon the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> but they lo&s;t it in 1469.</P>
<P>The Capital City has the &s;ame Name with the I&s;le, and is &s;ometimes called <HI>Euripont</HI> from <HI>Euripus,</HI> on who&s;e Banks it is &s;eated, towards the Continent of <HI>Achaia,</HI> 45 N. of <HI>Setines,</HI> 130 almo&s;t S. E. of <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> and 380 S. W. of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Long. 48 d. 25 m. Lat. 38 d. 20 m. It is joined to <HI>A|chaia</HI> by a Draw-bridge, which leads to a great Tower, for|merly Built by the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the <HI>Euripus,</HI> from whence they pa&s;s to the Continent by a Stone-bridge of five little Arches. This City is about two Miles in compa&s;s, but the Suburbs, which are Inhabited by <HI>Greek</HI> Chri&s;tians, are more populous than the City, where none but <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> dwell. All the Inhabitants are &s;aid to amount to the number of 15000, of which 10000 are Chri&s;tians. There are four Mo&s;ques, one whereof was formerly the Cathedral Church Dedicated to St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and was under the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Athens.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have a Hou&s;e in the Suburbs where they teach Youth. The <HI>Turks</HI> Attack'd this Place in <HI>June</HI> 1469. with a Fleet of 300 Sail, and an Army of 120000 Men, <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. being pre&s;ent; the Be&s;ieged over-powered by numbers, were fain to give way after a Gallant Defence. The Proveditor <HI>Erizzo,</HI> upon the <HI>Turks</HI> entring the City, retrenched him&s;elf, and did not Surrender till the <HI>Sultan</HI> had promi&s;ed him his Life, but he broke his Promi&s;e, and cau&s;ed him to be Sawed through in the mid&s;t. He had a Daughter called <HI>Anne,</HI> who beeau&s;e of her Beauty was pre&s;ented to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but &s;he di&s;daining his Care&s;&s;es, incen&s;ed him to that degree that he cut off her Head with his own Hand. Afterwards the <HI>Turks</HI> exer|ci&s;ed all manner of Cruelties upon the Garri&s;on, and the In|habitants of the City, putting all to the Sword above 20 Years old. In 1688. the <HI>Venetians</HI> Be&s;ieged this City with 24000 Men, and Storm'd it twice, but without Succe&s;s.</P>
