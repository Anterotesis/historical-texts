<P>_DEare Friends; It may &s;eeme strange to &s;ome of you, that I, who through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, had a comfortable provi|&s;ion for my out-ward &s;ub&s;i&s;tance in my owne Native Coun|try, &s;hould now travell &s;o farre abroad, and leave a Wife &s;o deare unto me, &s;o many neere Relations and Christian Friends, together with places of preferment which were offered me at home; But the truth is ever &s;ince I had the Honour to be imployed by tho&s;e Noble Lords, and other Adventurers, by providence as Governour there; In which voyage, having &s;eene sho&s;e Sou|therne Plantations, beholding the Sweetene&s;&s;e. Plea&s;antne&s;&s;e, and Profitablene&s;&s;e of them, as Nur&s;eries of Trade to <HI>England;</HI> And con&s;idering the onely end of my comming into the World was to glorifie God in my Generation, which ac|cording to the light of nature given me, I am per&s;waded that nothing more would conduce to that end, then endeavouring to make knowne God in the World, and to be u&s;efull and &s;erviceable to my Native Country, both which in this undertaking my Eye is fixed upon. For the Fir&s;t, I am per&s;waded the Lord hath a great worke by his Servants to make knowne the Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="2" REF="3">Chri&s;t, to the poore Heathen in the&s;e Ea&s;tern parts of the World, and I &s;hall much rejoyce if the Lord &s;hall plea&s;e by me to open a doore for that purpo&s;e. For the &s;econd, the &s;etling a Plantation in tho&s;e parts, is likely to be of great advantage to this Common-wealth, in the increa&s;e of Trade and Navigation, &s;ince the di&s;covery of this I&s;land of <HI>A&s;&s;ada</HI> to me; I had longing thoughts and earne&s;t de&s;ires of going thither, looking upon it as a worke of great concern|ment for the future to this Nation, and out of our fir&s;t attempt, I hope God in his due time will doe great things, therefore let none contemne the enterpri&s;e of &s;mall things; My purpo&s;e is by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty to endeavour the Settlement of an hone&s;t and ju&s;t Government there, neare&s;t to ehe Lawes of this Land, for greate&s;t incouragement and &s;ecurily to Adventurers; and for the better carrying on this worke, my Intentions are to &s;ettle two or three Godly men as Agents, at the King of the North end of <HI>Madaga&s;cars</HI> Court, who&s;e worke &s;hall be to indeavour to informe him and his people in the know|ledge of the Go&s;pell of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and to keepe a loving and peaceable corre&s;|pondency with them.</P>

<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which lyeth in &s;ight of this I&s;land of <HI>A&s;&s;ada,</HI> is 900 miles long, it hath &s;even Kings in it, the chief

Augu&s;tine Bay</HI> where our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> u&s;ually touch to water and buy Cattell, is the wor&s;er part of the I&s;land, in regard there is u&s;ually no Trade with any other Nation: nor any Townes, nor provi&s;ions for Planting, their being but a &s;mall number of peo|ple which are Cow-keepers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Whereas at <HI>A&s;&s;ada, Bay,</HI> an Engli&s;h Ship putting in there in her Voyage to <HI>India,</HI> found a &s;mall Towne called <HI>Anta&s;ia,</HI> where the <HI>Arabians</HI> lades divers Junks of <HI>Rice,</HI> yearly in exchange for <HI>Cullivers, Knives,</HI> and <HI>India</HI> Commodities, from thence our Engli&s;h travelling up to the Kings Town, about 20. miles up in the Land, pa&s;&s;ed through two Villages about a mile long, well inhabited with people, there being about them fields of <HI>Rice,</HI> and <HI>Sugar Caines,</HI> with hundreds of Cattell; their build|ings are of Timber two &s;tories high, open to walke in the hot weather, the upper Roomes to lodge in. The people naturally are very kinde and courteous, the North part for 2 hundred miles in length, is governed by a King, whom they went unto, to obtain licence to trade, he and his women dwelling in a Pal|lace about a quarter of a mile round, at the end of which is a &s;mall Towne, like a Parke in it, about 500. Oxen feeding, the people are generally his &s;laves, he u&s;eth our Engli&s;h court|eou&s;ly, &s;hewed them his Trea&s;ure, which was a Ma&s;&s;y Silver Staffe, &s;ome peeces of Eight, peeces of cloth of Gold, of Sattin and &s;ilke &s;tuffes, <HI>Arabian</HI> Coates, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> brought from <HI>India,</HI> being bought of them for <HI>Ambergree&s;e, Tortle-&s;hels,</HI> which are his owne Commodities.</P>
<P>He invited our men to come againe, and promi&s;ed all his Country &s;hould be at their command.</P>
<P>So that notwith&s;tanding the di&s;&s;olving of the Plantation at <HI>Auga&s;tines Bay,</HI> where tho&s;e that know it dare &s;ay, there is nei|ther good fre&s;h water, nor wood to build withall, nor Provi|&s;ion, nor Gardens for mans u&s;e: But it is a Mar&s;h ground, like <HI>Sandwitch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ownes in Kent,</HI> not &s;it for Plantation, which is an en|couragemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to proceed in this de&s;igne.</P>
<P>Thus you have heard in part what is related to me, by tho&s;e who have been neare 8. Mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">e upon the place, men of hone&s;t

And for tho&s;e that have either little or much to adventure, they may imploy it this way, and tho&s;e which have nothing, if they come over, for foure yeares as &s;er|vants to their Adventurers, they &s;hall have Meate Drinke and Apparell provided, and at the end of the terme in recompence of their &s;ervice, have as much Land to Plant on as they can im|ploy, with &s;ix Moneths provi&s;ions, and three <HI>Negros</HI> &s;ervants, which at <HI>Barbadoo's</HI> were worth a 100. pound, which if endu|&s;triou&s;ly imployed, may rai&s;e their Fortunes every yeare as much.</P>
<P><HI>And to my Honourable and worthy Adventurers, my humble &s;ute is, that you would take care of &s;ending me timely &s;upplyes of men, that I may be more enabled to goe on with tho&s;e de|&s;ignes propo&s;ed; which I forbeare to mention in publique, untill a more convenient time for the &s;ome,: And by the ble&s;&s;ing of God I doubt not of a good i&s;&s;ue.</HI></P>
