<HEAD>Rea&s;ons delivered by the Committee of Ci|tizens, Adventurers in <HI>London</HI> for Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the Committee appointed by the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common Councell of the &s;aid City, to be delivered to the &s;aid Court, of their refu&s;all to lend Monies upon &s;ecurity of the Ordinance of the 15^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, made for rai&s;ing Mo|nies for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to begin in <HI>November</HI> next, and to continue for &s;ix Moneths.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Adventurers, with their Monies rai&s;ed upon their fir&s;t Pro|po&s;itions, were to have carried over a Brigade of 500 Hor&s;e, and 5000 Foot, into <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e Re|bels; which bu&s;ine&s;&s;e they were to have carried on by Officers cho&s;en by them&s;elves, whereby they had the over&s;ight of that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and laying out of their own Money, for the be&s;t advantage of the Service.</P>
<P>When they had well nigh rai&s;ed and armed all their Forces, and made all other Provi&s;ions fit for tran&s;portation, both their Money, and Men, and Pro|vi&s;ions, were (upon an unavoidable occa&s;ion) made u&s;e of by the State here, upon a &s;uddain and unexpected breaking forth of the di&s;tractions here at home, and the remain of what was not thus imployed, or that hath come into their Trea&s;uries &s;ince, have likewi&s;e been made u&s;e of by the State here, wherewith to content the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers, who have done very little or no &s;er|vice for all the Money that they had &s;ince.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tractions increa&s;ing, and thereupon when tho&s;e Lords and Com|mons that were appointed by Commi&s;&s;ion, under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by direction both of King and Parliament, to manage the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> affairs, had withdrawn them&s;elves from further medling in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; and when after that, a Committe of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, made by order of the third of <HI>September,</HI> 1642. for ordering of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> affairs, had acted therein &s;o long, as that they had left no Ca&s;h in any <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Trea&s;ury to an&s;wer their Orders; and that a generall clamour of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Souldiary was now upon them for pay and &s;upplies, which they could not remedy; and a hard matter it was, by rea&s;on of the u&s;e of Monies here, to finde out a means to give
<PB N="2" REF="3"> them &s;atisfaction; when <HI>Bri&s;tol, Che&s;ter,</HI> and mo&s;t of th' other parts of the We&s;t, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Enemy, whereby all conveniencies for &s;ending for <HI>Ireland</HI> were taken away, then the Adventurers in <HI>London,</HI> made more Propo&s;itions to rai&s;e more Money from among them&s;elves, without Tax or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement of the Subject, to carry on that Warre.</P>
<P>That thereupon an Ordinance was made, e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e new Propo&s;i|tions, and to &s;ecure all &s;uch as &s;hould adventure any Money thereupon, and erecting and &s;etling of a new Committee, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome of the Members of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, and of diver&s;e Aldermen and Mer|chants of <HI>London,</HI> Adventurers for Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> cho&s;en out by the Body of Adventurers to manage the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> affairs.</P>
<P>And they were no &s;ooner made a Committee, but the Citizens of the Committee, are per&s;waded to advance 10000^l^b or thereabouts worth of Arms, Ammunition and victuals, wherewith to furni&s;h 500 Hor&s;e, and 5000 Foot, of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Regiments in <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> upon promi&s;e, that they &s;hould, being thus furni&s;hed, march out of that Province again&s;t the Rebels, into other parts of the Kingdom, having no enemy near them&s;elves; which Goods were pre&s;ently provided and delivered accordingly, yet they never did &s;ervice therewith, nor at any time &s;ince, that the Committee can under&s;tand.</P>
<P>That by the labour and indu&s;try of the Citizens of that Committee, they have procured 30000^l^b worth of Provi&s;ions more to be &s;ent to the Forces there, out of <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which if they had not recei|ved, they had disbanded and quit the Countrey to the Enemy, or mu&s;t have complied in the Ce&s;&s;ation with the Rebels, (which had been as bad) as &s;ome of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ficers confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Committee of the Citizens al&s;o, in this time have &s;ent 5000^l^b worth more of Provi&s;ions thither, which were bought with the Adventurers Money.</P>
<P>Yet they are now left in debt 5000^l^b or thereabout, for part of tho&s;e Provi&s;ions thus advanced, and without means to give tho&s;e &s;atisfaction to whom they &s;tand engaged; Which have been thus occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>For that it hath been publikely delivered to the Adventurers, at a generall meeting of them, as if the Parliament intend not to performe in that Or|dinance with tho&s;e that have or &s;hould bring in Money for an Adventure up|on it; &s;ince which time, very little or nothing hath been brought into their Trea&s;ury; and tho&s;e that had &s;ub&s;cribed upon that Ordinance, do refu&s;e to bring in their Sub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> affairs have been &s;ince carried on, for a good time together, by the Committe of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, of the third of
<PB N="3" REF="3"> <HI>September,</HI> 1642. and afterwards by the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms, and now by the Honourable Committee of Lords and Com|mons for Propo&s;itions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which have cooled and withdrawn the zeal and affections of the Adventurers and others, to bring in any more Mo|ney upon the &s;aid Ordinance of the 14^t^h of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. &s;eeing their Com|mittee &s;et a&s;ide, and to have no over&s;ight or looking unto the managing of that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and the di&s;po&s;all of their Monies; (that great &s;umme of 300000^l^b or thereabouts,) which they have formerly brought in, having been imployed as afore&s;aid, without adding to them the lea&s;t hope to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their Adventures.</P>
<P>They have been imployed &s;ince, as a Subcommittee to the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms; in which &s;ervice they have faithfully per|formed their tru&s;t, and have informed their Lord&s;hips of all tho&s;e mi&s;car|riages and failings of the Officers in the Armies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> then under the Parliaments power, and otherwi&s;e concerning tho&s;e affairs; and how the States Trea&s;ure have been wa&s;ted and con&s;umed, and nothing done for it; with their opinions of the remedies to prevent the like mi&s;doings for the time to come, which they having done in the birth of their imployments under their Lord&s;hips, have not lately received more of their commands, (ex|cept in rai&s;ing of Monies for the Service) to which they have alwayes con|tributed to their powers, when they have found certain wayes of reim|bur&s;ement.</P>
<P>In this time they have offered their endeavours freely, in making provi|&s;ions for tho&s;e Forces, out of the Monies rai&s;ed and to be rai&s;ed upon that Or|dinance of the 16^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. if to have been imployed in a Com|mittee way upon accompt; but the Officers of the Army in <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> and one M^r <HI>Davis</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> man, and &s;ome Chee&s;emongers of this City, joyning with them under hand, obtained the imployments, upon Contracts and bargains made, to deliver tho&s;e Provi&s;ions at certain rates; when the Committee, if to have done the &s;ame in a Committee way, would have advanced the &s;ame much &s;ooner, and have &s;aved the State 12000^l^b, or 15000^l^b, in 60000^l^b of the prices allowed <HI>Davis;</HI> and though they alwayes declined to do any thing in a way of bargaining, yet when it was pre&s;&s;ed of nece&s;&s;ity to be done no other way, they offered the State to do it by computation, 7000^l^b or thereabouts, in the &s;aid 60000^l^b, under tho&s;e rates that <HI>Davis</HI> offered; which not being &s;o apprehended, he hath been the Man hath carried on all that bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e before him ever &s;ince; but by his leave hath failed in all his underta|kings, both for time, manner and matter; for albeit his agreement was, for to have delivered the Goods by 10000^l^b the fir&s;t week, and 5000^l^b worth
<PB N="4" REF="4"> of Goods every week after, till the whole had been delivered, yet it was four or five moneths time before he delivered any parcell, and but very lately that he delivered the la&s;t; and hath vented &s;uch ba&s;e and un&s;erviceable Commo|dities, as they were little worth: be&s;ides that, he and his partners did runne no hazard in it at all, for he only a&s;&s;igned the Monies to come in, in &s;everall Counties to his re&s;pective Chapmen, for payment at long dayes, who took the &s;ame for &s;atisfaction upon their own Adventures, and re&s;erved a good &s;hare and benefit to him&s;elf; and then no doubt but they would al&s;o be Gain|ers by the hand, thus to tru&s;t; which mu&s;t bring poor Commodities to the Market of nece&s;&s;ity, or make his Cu&s;tomers but Savers by the hand; and this beginning hath brought him to be the generall undertaker and provider for what&s;oever Goods have gone for the Forces of <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ince; but in this latter bargains, he hath dealt much more &s;ecurely for him&s;elf, having &s;till fingered &s;o much Money in hand, upon the matter, as he hath acquired the Goods with|all, that if he &s;hould never get in the re&s;t, he can be no Lo&s;er by the hand, and an extream Gainer if to receive all, and hath made provi&s;ion to be &s;atisfied &s;ome other way, if he get it not by this way; be&s;ides that, he hath taken &s;uch wayes for the delivery of the Commodities, and made &s;uch provi&s;ions for the Collections of the Monies, that he will be &s;ure either to have it in before he &s;hall lay it out, with a 1000^l^b, and 6^d in the pound too for his pains in the collecting it, or if he fails, another Countrey is as good to him as this: be&s;ides that, he hath hemmed in to be paid out of the&s;e A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements for <HI>Ireland,</HI> an old pretended Debt of 12195^l^b, which is upon matter of Accompt, depend|ing before the Committee of Accompts for the Kingdoms, not yet by them allowed, and which if it &s;hall be &s;atisfied him, is a fortune that he hath rai&s;ed in little more then Nine moneths time, by the States imployments in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> there tru&s;ting him with 4000^l^b ready Money to buy the Souldiers Vi|ctuals, having no ability of his own before that time, wherewith to carry on &s;uch an Imployment; and the be&s;t of his Vouchers will prove Certificates in gro&s;&s;e from the &s;aid Colonels and Officers of that Army, for which no doubt but the common Souldiers have either made many hungry meals, or abated it out of their Commanders rents, they being mo&s;t their Tennants; and there|fore unwilling to go further abroad to do &s;ervice, then they can bewray the &s;moak of their own chimnies; and yet &s;uch a Stranger as this <HI>Davis,</HI> is able thus in le&s;&s;e then a years time, to furni&s;h 160000^l^b worth of Commodities for <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the Committee of Adventurers, con&s;i&s;ting of One and thirty Aldermen and good Merchants of this City, who de&s;ire to have no &s;uch gain from the Common wealth in &s;uch di&s;tracted and nece&s;&s;itous times as the&s;e.</P>

<P>The Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall (out of their zeal for the Publike, and care for the pre&s;ervation of that Kingdom, being &s;o neerly con|cerned with this, as that the wellfare of either is wrapt up together in the &s;a|fety and pre&s;ervation of them both, more then for any benefit they expect by their Adventures) the 27^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1644. did pre&s;ent &s;everall Propo&s;itions to the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, for rai&s;ing Monies principally from among them&s;elves, wherewith to maintain tho&s;e Forces again&s;t the Ce&s;&s;a|tion and the Rebels, and the &s;ame day a draught of that Ordinance (pa&s;&s;ed the 16^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. was al&s;o pre&s;ented to the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, by the Committee of that Honourable Hou&s;e, &s;itting by Order of the 3^d of <HI>September,</HI> 1642. afore&s;aid, and both were Committed together: but the Committee of Grocers-Hall as yet, (by rea&s;on of the more weighty affairs of the Kingdom,) have received no an&s;wer concerning them; they have al&s;o diver&s;e times &s;ince renewed their humble de&s;ires therein, by &s;everall Petitions and Remon&s;trances, pre&s;ented both to the Honourable Hou&s;es, and the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms, for their mediation that &s;ome|thing might be done therein, but other the great affairs of the State, hath &s;till prevented the con&s;ideration thereof: they have lately al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves therein to the Honourable Committee of Lords and Commons, ap|pointed for receiving of Propo&s;itions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with whom they debated the &s;ame, and after con&s;ultation thereof among&s;t them&s;elves, of the re&s;ults of both Committees, their Lord&s;hips tran&s;mitted back again unto them the heads of &s;uch of their Propo&s;itions, as they thought fit for the Con&s;idera|tion of the Hou&s;es, de&s;iring that the body of Adventurers might be called together, to advi&s;e with the Committee thereupon, and to certifie them what Moneys they would advance, and what other encouragements they would give, to move the Hou&s;es to incline to pa&s;&s;e them: and thereupon the Adventurers did meet accordingly, and upon debate thereof among&s;t them|&s;elves, did returne the &s;ame back again to the &s;aid Honourable Committee of Lords and Commons for Propo&s;itions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with &s;ome &s;mall altera|tions; and withall did returne unto their Lord&s;hips the humble Petition of the Committee and Body of the mo&s;t principall Adventurers of the City, &s;igned with many of their hands; offering upon the credit of &s;uch an Ordi|nance to pa&s;&s;e pre&s;ently, to have advanced 20000^l^b in Money, and &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ions as &s;hould be ordered to be &s;ent for relief of tho&s;e Forces, and that they did not doubt but thereby to make all further &s;upplies for carrying on that Warre in <HI>Munster,</HI> and that tho&s;e Forces being well &s;upplied and maintain|ed (under God) might be a great and ready means, quickly to reduce all that Kingdom under the power of the Parliament; and praying their
<PB N="6" REF="5"> Lord&s;hips to recommend that their Petition, with the &s;aid Propo&s;itions to the Honourable Hou&s;es to be con&s;idered accordingly; but all this notwith|&s;tanding, the Adventurers cannot under&s;tand that the &s;ame have been deli|vered to the Hou&s;es accordingly.</P>
<P>But now &s;ince the Right Honourable the Lord Major, have heretofore been de&s;ired to &s;ummon a meeting of all the Adventurers, and that it might be propounded unto them to lend 15000^l^b, or more Money upon the Credit of this other Ordinance lately pa&s;&s;ed, for rai&s;ing Monies for <HI>Ireland,</HI> by an|other A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement for &s;ix Moneths more, to begin in <HI>November</HI> next; at which meeting &s;ome of that Honourable Committee were pre&s;ent, and upon debate thereof it was not thought fit to be done; and indeed both the Com|mittee and Body of Adventurers having formerly been treated with to that purpo&s;e, both before and &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of that Ordinance, did give their opinions, that if it &s;hould pa&s;&s;e, as things then &s;tood, and yet do &s;tand, it could hardly be expected that Monies would be advanced upon it, for diver&s;e rea|&s;ons then given; and &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing it, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Citizens are named, without the privity of the Adventurers, to go for <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ire|land</HI> to act for the City there, which never had, nor hath any particular en|gagement in that part of the Kingdom, the Adventurers hoping they &s;hall have their own Choice, of &s;uch as they &s;hall employ there, concerning their Adventures.</P>
<P>And the Rea&s;ons that moved the Committee of Grocers-Hall heretofore, and yet doth, to refu&s;e the lending of any Money, upon this Ordinance of the 15^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1645. were, and are the&s;e following. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The &s;aid Ordinance doth revive a former Ordinance of the 18^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. and the Committee have never yet &s;een or under&s;tood of any &s;uch Ordinance made, but of an Ordinance made the 16^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. to which this Ordinance hath no relation; and if there be no &s;uch Ordinance of the 18^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. then this Ordinance of the 15^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1645. hath lo&s;t its effect, and cannot revive that which never had a being.</P>
<P>Secondly, To revive an Ordinance to have continuance for a longer time, after its expiration, without more words to expre&s;&s;e the intent and power thereof, to make new Levies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may admit of a di&s;pute, what is meant by this word (Reviving) &s;tanding thus alone, and may well be con&s;trued only to intend the Levying of &s;uch Monies thereupon, as have not been colle|cted within the time of its being and continuance, and in &s;uch a Ca&s;e is no foundation of Credit, to engage for borrowing of Money.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Admitting the&s;e exceptions were out of doors, (yet then there is a provi&s;o, that all Arrearages which &s;hall be due and unlevied for the
<PB N="7" REF="5"> Weekly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements upon the &s;aid Ordinance of the 18^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. (if any &s;uch be) for the time of Continuance fir&s;t limited therein, the &s;ame &s;hall be leavied, brought in and paid to the Trea&s;urers according to the Ordi|nance, and that the &s;ame &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed and i&s;&s;ued out for the di&s;charge of the Orders and Contracts made with the Hou&s;es of Parliament, or the Committee of the two Kingdoms, in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid Ordinance; which &s;hews, that the word, Reviving, in the Ordinance of the 15^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1645. is meant of Leavying what is behinde and unpaid of that Ordinance at the time of its expiration, and mentions nothing of any new Leavy or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement to be made, and &s;o is conceived no &s;uch &s;ecurity to borrow Money upon as is propounded.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Ordinance of the 16^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. made for an A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ement thorow the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the pre&s;ent Relief of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Armies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hould rai&s;e above 200000^l^b in all places; and that there is 80000^l^b charged upon it, fir&s;t for relieving the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Regiments in <HI>&V;l&s;ter;</HI> and M^r <HI>John Davis</HI> hath ob|tained another reviving Ordinance of it, of the 27^t^h of <HI>September,</HI> 1645. to &s;atisfie him the &s;umme of 36945^l^b more, &s;o it is charged with 116945^l^b in all; of this, 50000^l^b is only yet come into the Trea&s;ury, that there is 66945^l^b yet to be leavied, and this mu&s;t be leavied the fir&s;t; and who will lend Money, to expect it after the leavying and payment of &s;uch a Summe, and to put it to a hazard; whenas a man may lend out his Money, and have 8^l^b <HI>per cent.</HI> for it, to be repaid in his own time, and to have as good &s;ecurity as the Kingdom can afford?</P>
<P>Fifthly, If only 50000^l^b of 200000^l^b have been brought in, in a years time, and at the fir&s;t beginning, when men were better able and di&s;po&s;ed to the worke, and this done by the earne&s;t and continuall &s;ollicitation of M^r <HI>Da|vis,</HI> and of his Emi&s;&s;aries and Creditours that are &s;o concerned in it, and have acted it to the life; what can be conceived mu&s;t follow of the&s;e A&s;&s;e&s;&s;e|ments in the later end of the day, when men are more and more exhau&s;ted in their e&s;tates, and who now do fall &s;hort to &s;atisfie tho&s;e A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements (in as great a proportion) of maintenance of Generall <HI>Fairfax</HI> Army, and of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in <HI>England,</HI> which are for their immediate and more nece&s;|&s;ary pre&s;ervation, and the &s;ubduing of an Enemy here at home?</P>
<P>Sixtly, The people begin generally to under&s;tand the ill carriage of M^r <HI>Da|vis,</HI> and his fellow Chee&s;mongers in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and that they hunt af|ter the&s;e bargains, to rai&s;e them&s;elves fortunes this way, and care not how they deceive the Common wealth, &s;o they may enrich them&s;elves, and put the Money into their own pur&s;es; which not only makes the people unwil|ling,
<PB N="8" REF="6"> but many of them wilfull to refu&s;e the payment of the&s;e Monies, which many of them do apprehend thus may be ca&s;t away; and are not a little troubled, to &s;ee the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> men of worth and integrity, un|imployed in the &s;ervice; and &s;uch a poor fellow as <HI>Davis,</HI> and a meer &s;tran|ger, vaulting him&s;elf herein again&s;t the whole City. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall, as heretofore, &s;o do now again de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed for lending of any Monies upon the Tearmes propound|ed, which they de&s;ire may be delivered to the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common-Councell, as their &s;en&s;e and an&s;wer to their demands.</P>
<P>And now albeit they are not de&s;irous to draw imployment, and the bur|then of more bu&s;ine&s;&s;e upon them&s;elves, yet for the good and benefit of the Common-wealth, and the better &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o nearly concerned with this; if the Hou&s;es of Parliament might be moved yet to con&s;ider of their Propo&s;itions, and to pa&s;&s;e them into an Ordinance, in &s;uch way as they &s;hall thinke fit, that &s;o a ground and &s;ure foundation may be laid, not only to relieve tho&s;e Forces in <HI>Munster</HI> for the pre&s;ent, but to maintain and carry on that Warre there. Upon the Credit of &s;uch an Ordinance, they &s;hall yet be willing to advance the 20000^l^b &s;o formerly undertaken, and carefully to provide for continuall &s;upplies to be made for the future; and will freely be&s;tow their greate&s;t care and in|du&s;try, to husband things for the be&s;t benefit and advantage of the Ser|vice, without expectation of benefit or reward; and doubt not but in &s;uch ca&s;e (under God) to render the Parliament a good Accompt of that Pro|vince in a &s;hort time; which is e&s;pecially con&s;iderable (as the State of the affairs of that Kingdom now &s;tands at pre&s;ent) that it be &s;ecured of all the re&s;t, both again&s;t the Rebels within it &s;elf, and the Enemy that may invade it &s;uddainly from abroad.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e hereunto annexed the Copies of tho&s;e heads of their &s;aid Propo&s;itions and of their Petition, the Originals remaining with the &s;aid Committee of Lords and Commons, which were, as they conceive, once heretofore agreed upon by the &s;aid Committe and body of Adventurers, to have been pre&s;ented to the Honourable Hou&s;es of Parliament for their con&s;ideration: and it is the humble &s;uit of this Committee, that the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common-Councell, would yet be plea&s;ed, if they &s;hall &s;o thinke fit, to interpo&s;e their mediation to the Ho|nourable Hou&s;es of Parliament, that the &s;ame may be con&s;idered accordingly, and in &s;uch way as they &s;hall thinke fit.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons in this pre&s;ent Parliament a&s;&s;embled, The Humble Petition of the Committee and Body of Adventurers in <HI>London</HI> for Lands in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;itting at Grocers-Hall.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Shewing,</OPENER>
<P>THat ever &s;ince the Parliament, by their Ordinance of the 14^t^h of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. was plea&s;ed to make them a Committee to act in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> affairs, they have imployed the utmo&s;t of their endeavours to &s;erve the Common-wealth in that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and are ready to give an Accompt of their Actions therein, which they are well a&s;&s;ured, upon ex|amination, will render them free and clear from all neglect of duty and &s;ervice in what&s;oever they have been tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>But it hath been their unhappine&s;&s;e in this time, for want of further power and tru&s;t, that they have not been &s;o &s;erviceable as they de&s;ired, and as other|wi&s;e they could have been.</P>
<P>And many moneths &s;ince, they humbly pre&s;ented to this Honourable A&s;|&s;embly their Petition, together with certain Propo&s;itions for rai&s;ing Monies for the better carrying on of that Warre, and whereof &s;everall times &s;ince th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y have been, by their other Remon&s;trances and &s;upplications, be&s;ought the con&s;ideration, which by the interpo&s;ition of more weighty affairs have till this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ven by.</P>
<P>And now lately they have again addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves herein unto the Ho|nourable Committee of Lord and Commons, for receiving and preparing of Propo&s;itions for the Honourable Hou&s;es for this Service, and who upon the
<PB N="13" REF="8"> debate hereof have been plea&s;ed to approve of &s;o much thereof, as your Peti|tioners do humbly conceive they have already, or do &s;hortly intend to pre&s;ent to this Honourable A&s;&s;embly to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners do apprehend the Province of <HI>Munster</HI> in that Realm, and con&s;equently that Kingdom, is now at pre&s;ent in great danger to be lo&s;t, without timely &s;upplies, and provi&s;ions to be made for to maintain tho&s;e Forces for the future.</P>
<P>And they further crave leave, humbly to pre&s;ent their &s;en&s;e and opinions of this pre&s;ent affair (alwayes with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your graver judgements) that if the&s;e Propo&s;itions &s;hall be thought fit to be framed into an Ordinance, to pa&s;&s;e both the Honourable Hou&s;es of Parliament; then your Petitioners, upon the credit thereof, will advance 20000^l^b in Money, and Provi&s;ions for the Service, and in &s;uch rea&s;onable time as the exegencie of the occa&s;ion, and this Honourable Hou&s;e &s;hall r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">quire the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And are confident from time to time, to make all &s;uch further &s;upplies for maintenance of the Forces there in that Province, by this means, as will not only render the &s;ame wholly under your power, but probably (under God) may be a great occa&s;ion to reduce tho&s;e Rebels to their obedience, and &s;ubject all that Realm under the Parliaments command.</P>
<P>All the Adventurers al&s;o, and others with them alike concerned in that Kingdom, will thus undoubtedly be abundantly &s;atisfied and encouraged, with ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">erfullne&s;&s;e to contribute and lay out them&s;elves yet more in this af|fair; and the Parliament will be freed from much trouble and care other|wi&s;e for to make provi&s;ions for that &s;ervice for the future and time to come.</P>
<P>The lives of many thou&s;ands of poor Prote&s;tants, our friends and brethren, will thus be there pre&s;erved, and this Kingdom delivered from a bloud-thir&s;ty Enemy, which otherwi&s;e will daily infe&s;t us here at home, both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>The honour of this Nation will be thus &s;till pre&s;erved, in maintaining our intere&s;ts there, which our Ance&s;tours heretofore have purcha&s;ed, and for many hundreds of years maintained, with the expence of much Trea&s;ure and bloud.</P>
<P>The Parliament and its party will be hereby exceedingly &s;trengthened, and their Adver&s;aries extreamly weakned, both in their pre&s;ent hopes, power and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both there and from abroad.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant party thorowout Chri&s;tendome, will the rather al&s;o be en|couraged to joyn with us in this great worke of Reformation, and a fruit|full and good Land will thus again ere long be repeopled, to live under the Sun&s;hine of the Go&s;pel, where otherwi&s;e Popery and &s;uper&s;tition will be planted, to the great di&s;honour of Almighty God, and the great di&s;comfort of the Nation to &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>Your Petitioners will thus al&s;o &s;ave very much to the State, both in the prices and goodne&s;&s;es of &s;uch provi&s;ions as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;arily &s;ent for that Service, and will do the &s;ame in time as readily, and much more &s;atisfacto|rily to the people, then any particular men &s;hall po&s;&s;ibly be able to undertake and do; All which they humbly pray this Honourable A&s;&s;embly to con&s;ider accordingly.</P>

<P>They are all Propo&s;itions tending to the maintenance of that Warre, the more &s;peedy reducing of tho&s;e Rebels to their obedience, the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of that Government once again in peace and quiet, and the better peopling and civilizing of that Realm, for which all &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly contend, and lay down tho&s;e ways and means that have the greate&s;t likelihood and appearance to effect a good and &s;peedy plantation of that Kingdom, with a religious people, in the place and &s;tead of that Idolatrous Nation the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels.</P>

<P>The Governours al&s;o of that Realm, for the mo&s;t part heretofore, having &s;o great power put into their hands, have been &s;o lifted and puffed up with the conceipt and opinion of their greatne&s;&s;e, that they have commonly for|gotten their errand, and for what end they were placed there; and have been mi&s;led to all inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, to make them&s;elves and their followers rich and honourable, out of the ruines and de&s;truction of the &s;ubject, and therefore the government have been ob&s;erved to be more pro|&s;perous and happy, when it hath been by more Ju&s;tices, then by any one De|puty, or Lord Lieutenant of the Kingdom.</P>

<P>And do propo&s;e the tenth, as a thing &s;o con&s;iderable, that to be granted would bring in much Monies, with the love and bounty of the people; would ea&s;e them from other Taxes and A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and would in no &s;ort be burthen|&s;ome or grievous, and would be a foundation and way laid, to carry on a great part of the Warre there unto the end of it, without troubling the Par|liament and State upon every occa&s;ion, to &s;eek out and finde new wayes to rai&s;e Monies for that Service, and which many times comes with murmur and grudgings of the people; and will engage many more Adventurers to plant there, when the Warre &s;hall be ended; and is but of the &s;ame nature Monethly, as the Weekly meal which was rai&s;ed lately in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>And do informe the eleventh, that the Committee may be rightly under|&s;tood, not to &s;eek them&s;elves; and to &s;hew, they have no by ends of their own in all this they offer to perform, but to act freely and with publike &s;pirits, as only looking to advance the good cau&s;e in hand, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>And do propo&s;e the twelfth, for &s;uch rea&s;ons as they have herein formerly declared; all which they humbly &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of the Parlia|ment, and &s;hall be well &s;atisfied with what&s;oever the Hou&s;es &s;hall be plea&s;ed to re&s;olve upon therein, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
