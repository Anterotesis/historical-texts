<HEAD>A MESSAGE Sent from the States of HOLLAND, To the King of Scots; touching his Re&s;i|dence in the Low-Countries; with his An&s;wer thereunto; and the great preparations at the Hague for his en|tertainment.</HEAD>
<P>_BY an Expre&s;s from the Hague it is certified, That the E&s;tates of the United Provinces, at a General
<PB N="4" REF="3">Councel, taking into ferious debate and con&s;ultati|on the great and weighty Affaires of their Com|monwealth, and how the ground-work thereof, might be carryed on with the be&s;t advantage, in this Juncture of time again&s;t England, after mature deli|beration, it was terminated, That a Me&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;ent to the King of Scots, imploring his Re&s;idence at the Hague; to the end, that by a mutual conde|&s;cen&s;ion, all po&s;&s;ible meanes might be u&s;ed for the pre&s;ervation of their Religion, Liberty, Freedom, and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This Me&s;&s;age being &s;ent by the Lord Boretz, &amp; pre&s;ented, a Councel was thereupon called at Saint Germans, where was pre&s;ent divers of the Engli&s;h Nobility, and after &s;erious con&s;ultation, mutually a&s;&s;ented to leave his titular Maje&s;ty, to the fortune of his Re&s;olutions, by rea&s;on of his ardent affection to be &s;o far importuning, that he cho&s;e rather to communicate a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to the States, then any wayes to decline or wave &s;o cordial an in|vitation.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance whereof, great are the preparations at the Hague for &s;olemnizing of his Reception, in tryumph and honour.</P>
<P>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was &s;et upon
<PB N="5" REF="3">by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant di&s;|pute, for the &s;pace of half an hour; which our Ad|miral hearing of, di&s;patched captain Wat&s;on and captain Taylor to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who bearing up &s;o drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath &s;o exa&s;perated the &s;pirits of many, that they are ex|ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</P>
<P>We hear that there is a general Ri&s;ing from 16 to 60; and tho&s;e that do refu&s;e to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are &s;etting forth another great Fleet of 100 &s;ail, and the Zealanders have cho|&s;en a new Admiral.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. John Lilburn hath cau&s;ed a Declara|tion to be publi&s;hed at Am&s;terdam; wherein he &s;tates the Ca&s;e between England, and the United Provinces, in this pre&s;ent Juncture, whereby all true Engli&s;h-men may apparently di&s;cern, how much it concerneth them to be unanimous and vigilant up|on the motion and de&s;ign of the Netherlanders, who are a&s;pir'd to &s;uch a height of Ingratitude, that they would willingly forget what was their condi|tion when England fir&s;t undertook their protection and e&s;pou&s;ed their quarrel with the lo&s;s of many thou&s;ands Engli&s;h-men, and the expence of eleven hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Among&s;t the re&s;t, there hath been a paper of great concernment di&s;per&s;ed throughout the &s;everal Provinces; a Copy whereof followeth:</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<Q><P>It is no whole&s;om coun&s;el to tru&s;t ano|ther with the death of one de&s;cended of Royal bloud: he &s;uffers him to live either through pity or policy: If he be compa&s;&s;i|onate, he knows not how to be cruel; if po|litick, he thinks the pre&s;ent times will not la&s;t long; his thoughts are bu&s;ied on times to come; and he endeavours more to &s;ave him&s;elf, then to &s;ecure others: And whereas &s;ome there are, who &s;ay, That to take away a Kingdom, and &s;uffer the King to live, is a cruel piece of charity, wherewith all Ty|rants while&s;t they go about to deceive the World, they oft-times deceive them&s;elves. The whole will ea&s;ily meet together, the parts whereof are left alive. To &s;et the Sta|tue of Vertue upon a de&s;picable foundation is as much as to build a Colo&s;&s;us of Gold upon feet of dirt: Piety becomes a State, for that his Government is free: Cruelty, a Tyrant, for that he is violent; courte&s;ie be|fits
<PB N="7" REF="4">the one, force is requi&s;ite to the other: neither yet doth that &s;ecure him; he is not unlike a belly-god, who if he per&s;i&s;t to eat, a &s;urfeit kils him; if he de&s;i&s;t, a diet; if the Tyrant bloudy his hands without re&s;pect, he dies for being cruel; if otherwi&s;e, for &s;ee|ming to be pious.</P>
<P>In a word, that hand wil not pro&s;per, that fights under the Banner of Tyranny; and the force and might of all tho&s;e wilbe mau|gred that fights for the intere&s;t of U&s;urpa|tion. Therefore, who are ye, O ye Nether|landers, that dare to &s;et your &s;elves again&s;t the Lord, again&s;t what he hath done, and is done in England, Scotland, and Ireland; to endeavor to &s;trike out all the glorious Cha|racters of his foot-&s;teps and pre&s;ence, what his Arm hath brought to pa&s;s for him, and his mighty Power e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e Do|minions? Who are you that dare to think, that you can root out this Cau&s;e, and give
<PB N="8" REF="5">the Lye to all the appearances of God, the Prayer, the Faith, the Prai&s;es of the Saints in tho&s;e Nations? Who are you that &s;ay their Gods, are Gods of the Hills, therefore we will fight with them in the Valleys: they &s;tood again&s;t their own forces, but they &s;hall not again&s;t ours: The Land is given them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but the Deep is ours, and we will &s;wallow them up as in the belly of Hell? Our God is the &s;ame, and &s;o is Our Cau&s;e on the Sea, as well as the Land: Spain found it &s;o in the year 1588. and all others have &s;ince our late Wars and Trou|bles.</P></Q>
