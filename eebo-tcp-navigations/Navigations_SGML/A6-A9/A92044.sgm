<P>_IF Violence and Time had con&s;pired to wear out all the Memorials of former Ages, give me leave to pre&s;ent you with a brief (but plea&s;ant) Chronicle to all Po&s;terity, of his Royal Maie&s;ties Birth, Edu|cation, and Progre&s;s; And &s;hould modern worth be blotted out of all Records, a re&s;tored <HI>Charles</HI> &s;ufficeth, in whom the forlorn Vertue of our wor&s;t of Times took &s;anctuary: 'Tis his Soveraign Graces, that delights the Soules of his loyal Subjects: And we need not wonder, that Nature was 5 years meditating on the great piece that was to re&s;ult from &s;uch a Royal Conflux, both of Father and Mother; in who&s;e Bed all the Royal Families of <HI>Europe</HI> met: in his Father there was by his great Grandmother the wife of <HI>James</HI> the Fourth Britti&s;h Maie|&s;ty; by his Grandfather he &s;hared of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Royalty, by his Mother of the <HI>Dani&s;h,</HI> by his Father of the <HI>Norman,</HI> by his Si&s;ter he was allied to the Elector Palatine; as he was related to <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;o he was to <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">and,</HI> and to mo&s;t of the <HI>German</HI> or <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Princes; in our Soveraigns Mother there lodgeth all that's Soveraign in the <HI>Bourbons</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Me|dices</HI> of <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rence,</HI> (&s;o true is it that God made all Nations of one blood.) It was after five years mutual enjoyment of each other <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t King of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter to a great
<PB N="4" REF="3">and Si&s;ter to a ju&s;t King of <HI>France</HI> received this Son, the &s;acred pledge to them of Heavens, and each others Love. For He was born the 29 Day of <HI>May,</HI> 1630. St. <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> birth-day, where we may hope this Nur&s;ing Father of our Church will with his &s;word which He bears not in vain, prove as great a Defender of the faith once delivered to the Saints, as the other Holy Father did with his pen, and we made as happy in this Crown and Scepter, as the Antient Church was in that <HI>Miter</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;ier. May</HI> never knew a more hopeful Flower then this that happily &s;prung up from the Ro&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> joyned to the Lillies of <HI>France;</HI> a <HI>flower</HI> to who&s;e compo&s;ure it &s;eems Nature &s;ummoned its divided glo|ries, as <HI>Zouxis</HI> did his &s;everal Beauties to make up one <HI>Venus;</HI> well this <HI>May</HI> was then thought mo&s;t happy until now, we have lived to &s;ee another <HI>May,</HI> as much more happy, as it is to be brought to a Kingdom then to be brought to the world, to be received as a Prince into the di&s;creet embraces of Nations, then as a Child in|to the fond Embraces of a Nur&s;e; to be crowned then to be cra|dled: Great was the remark of this Royal Infant through each tender Line, relating to &s;o worthy a Prince, as is fit to be con&s;e|crated to Solemnities worthy a Chronicle. The Heavens &s;eemed to congratulate his royal birth, a Star appearing at mid-day over St. <HI>James,</HI> di&s;playing its mode&s;t beams in &s;pight of Sun-&s;hine in the middle of the Air, <HI>(an embleme of his future glory,)</HI> Thus did the Heavens expre&s;s them&s;elves in miracles and wonders; and it is our duty to admire them, as the works of the Lord, and therefore wonderful in our eyes: Yet the great <HI>Selden</HI> attempted to inter|pret that Star thus:
<Q><L>When to <HI>Pauls</HI> Cro&s;s the greatful King drew near?</L>
<L>A &s;hining Star did in the Heavens appear,</L>
<L>Thou that con&s;ult'&s;t with Divine My&s;teries,</L>
<L>Tell me what this bright Comet &s;ignifies?</L>
<L>Now is there born a valiant Prince it'h We&s;t,</L>
<L>That &s;hall eclip&s;e the Kingdoms of the Ea&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>The King our Soveraigns Father being &s;en&s;ible that Children to any man e&s;pecially to a Prince are an inheritance from the Lord, went &s;olemnly to St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> (once a Cathedral, &s;ince a &s;table; once a Church to entertain Chri&s;t in, &s;ince a Manger for Rebels to revel in) and there acknowledged with the Emperour <HI>Antoninus</HI> in St. <HI>Pauls</HI> phra&s;e, that by God, and through God, and therefore to Him, and the glory of his prai&s;e are all things.</P>

<P>This Bud of Maje&s;ty was committed to the care of the honou|rable Counte&s;s of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> to be by her tender hands, and softer care cheri&s;hed to grow up a Soveraign, where He &s;ucked graces in with milk, and vertues as early as nouri&s;hment; as appears by the mo&s;t incomparable gifts and graces wherewith God hath bin plea&s;ed to endow his Maje&s;ty. To pa&s;s by his outward Man, come|lier, and with <HI>Saul</HI> higher then all the people, &s;o that there is <HI>none</HI> like him among all the people; &s;o exactly formed, that with <HI>Ab|&s;alon</HI> from the Crown of his head to the &s;oul of his foot the mo&s;t curious eye could not di&s;cern an error or a &s;pot; the plea&s;ing &s;e|verity and &s;oft rigorou&s;ne&s;s of that face which is both Maje&s;tick and beautiful, &s;olemn and comely; though of late he is grown leaner with cares and age; the dark and night complexion of his face, and the twin-&s;tars of his quick and &s;harp eyes &s;parkling in that night; He is mo&s;t beautiful when he &s;peaks, his black &s;hi|ning Locks naturally curled into great Rings hath hitherto been his Ornament and Crown; his motions ea&s;ie and graceful, and plainly Maje&s;tick! &amp;c. I &s;ay to pa&s;s by the&s;e lower worths of neat &s;haped du&s;t and well framed earth, come we to his Mind which is indeed him&s;elf; which you may gue&s;s noble by that body where|in it dwels, &s;uch Cabinets were made onely for the mo&s;t precious Jewel: the plea&s;ing parts and motions of that body are emblems of his mind; beauty, comeline&s;s, proportion, &amp;c. the gro&s;s Orna|ments of the body, are &s;o many refined vertues in his &s;oul: 1. His va&s;t Under&s;tanding, as &s;preading, and as wide as the things to be under&s;tood; three Nations put limits to his power, its the world onely that confines his thoughts. His Maje&s;ty under&s;tands <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> writes <HI>French</HI> correctly; the <HI>French, Italian, Spaniards,</HI> (like tho&s;e <HI>Parthians, Medes,</HI> and <HI>Elamites</HI> in the Acts) are amazed to hear Him, replying to each of them in their own Tongue wherein they were born. In the&s;e &s;everal Languages he peru&s;eth &s;uch parts of knowledge as may compleat a Soveraign: Logick &s;eems to be his Nature as well as Rea&s;on, He cannot &s;peak incon|&s;equently. He hath read divers of the choice&s;t pieces of policy, &amp; gathered the &s;cattered wi&s;dom and rea&s;on that run through Po|liticians writings and actions in his own brea&s;t, and there dige&s;ted them into axiomes of an entire and well framed policy; to policy He hath added ancient and modern Hi&s;tory; whereupon he &s;eeth tho&s;e things performed, that He &s;aw in policy contri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. When we have admired the gracious contents of any of His Maje&s;ties Writings, we cannot but admire al&s;o his excellent Rhetorick.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P N="1">1. His Maje&s;ty being naturally aver&s;e from that lawle&s;s power he &s;aw exerci&s;ed in the Countryes where he &s;ojourned; and re&s;ol|ved to Govern by Laws; he proceeds to &s;tudy the Law of Nati|ons, and that of his own Countrey too; wherein his Father &s;o ex|celled, that few Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI> came near him; his skil in Geography, what with his &s;tudy, what with his Travels is ad|mirable: Indeed the u&s;eful parts of the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> the <HI>Globe, Fortification, &amp;c.</HI> take him up very much, in <HI>Navigation,</HI> what by his own <HI>Genius,</HI> what by conver&s;e with <HI>Marinners,</HI> and his own Ob&s;ervations in the <HI>Downes,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, he is &s;o good a Pro|ficient, that expert Seamen have admired him, and dare promi&s;e that his skil that way will be no &s;mall advantage to the Nation, who&s;e Intere&s;t lyes in forraign Voyages and Trades; But Divinity is his Mi&s;tre&s;s, with who&s;e whole&s;ome principles he hath well &s;tocked the great &s;pirit of his mind, upon which his Soul may re&s;t; he &s;earches that word of God which is able to make a man wi&s;e to &s;alvation, and <HI>perfect to every good work,</HI> in a word, he hath all the advantages of knowledge. 1 A cleer apprehen&s;ion to re|ceive a right and di&s;tinct notion of the things repre&s;ented to him. 2 Solidity of Judgement to weigh the particulars he ap|prehends. 3. Fidelity of Retention; for as Nature hath given to the bodies of men for the furtherance of Corporal &s;trength, a Retentive power to cla&s;p and hold fa&s;t that which pre&s;erveth it, until a thorough concoction be wrought, &s;o he hath a Retentive faculty of Memory given to Rea&s;on as a means to con&s;olidate and inrich it.</P>
<P N="2">2. His great wi&s;dome, as of an Angel of God, as large a heart to know good and evil, as great education, the difference of Na|tion and Factions he had to deal with, his Enemies oppo&s;ition, his Friends treachery, his per&s;onal conver&s;e with men of all &s;orts, the variety of his experience from the di&s;tinct knowledge of the Natures of the People of &s;everal Countreys of their chief Mini|&s;ters of State Eccle&s;ia&s;tick and Civil, and all this as a noble Pen ob&s;erves in adver&s;ity, which opens the under&s;tanding, and con|firms the judgement, could make; he with his Grand-father of <HI>France</HI> carrieth a Councel with him upon one Hor&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. But this wi&s;dome were dangerous, were it not accompani|ed with ju&s;tice, his wi&s;dom is not a crafty or &s;ordid &s;ubtilty, nor devili&s;h policie; but pure, good, and ju&s;t Judgement: He hath a Ju&s;tice that becomes the Throne, a con&s;tant will to give every
<PB N="7" REF="4">Man his due, as he hath well or ill de&s;erved: A per&s;on of Honour who hath &s;pent 18 years in his Maje&s;ties Court and &s;ervice, doth upon di&s;tinct knowledge let the World know he can as confident|ly believe that his Maje&s;ty is ju&s;t as that he is a Man; he ob&s;erves a Ju&s;tice in his word, and in his action, the one is an <HI>Oracle,</HI> and the other Law.</P>
<P N="4">4. But he hath a mercy that rejoyceth over his Ju&s;tice, a mer|cy calculated for our time and Nation, wherein Subjects were ne|ver &s;o obnoxious to Ju&s;tice, nor a Prince &s;o enclined to mercy; a People was hardly ever &s;o guilty as we, and hardly a Prince ever &s;o gratious as him&s;elf, we are not more ready to offend then he to pardon; with what tender Maje&s;ty doth he pa&s;s by the guilty pro&s;trate? his Ju&s;tice doth but cut out work for his Mercy! what &s;tubborn Offenders that brings upon their knees, this &s;toops to bring them up again; they that fall by his &s;everity, ri&s;e up again by his favour; he is more compa&s;&s;ionate to Men then they are to them&s;elves: It is but the lea&s;t part of his mercy that he can be merciful to others while they are mo&s;t cruel to him, he is exerci|&s;ing the highe&s;t charity towards them, while they are exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t injuries towards him; this Nature taught him, then God, and afterwards his Father, in that incomparable advice to him.</P>
<P N="5">5. A general goodne&s;s, (whereof that mercy is but a branch) familiar conver&s;e, ea&s;ine&s;s of acce&s;s, a readine&s;s to communicate him&s;elf, his fair carriage towards all, how unwilling he is to force men to do him right, how (when he who fears not to do others ju&s;tice) afraid is he to do it to him&s;elf? I know not whe|ther he be more good then great, more <HI>Charlebone</HI> then <HI>Charle|maine;</HI> I am &s;ure his virtues are e&s;teemed by him more then his Kingdome, and he doth not exerci&s;e the&s;e vertues (as malice, as Hell once &s;ugge&s;ted) that he might di&s;&s;emble him&s;elf to his ju&s;t Right; but he would obtain his Right that he might be the more able to exerci&s;e his vertues; his Right will therefore plea&s;e him, becau&s;e then he is able to forgive them that did him wrong.</P>
<P N="6">6. His magnanimity, fortitude, and courage; he is as magna|nimous in &s;uffering wrong, as he is valiant in attempting to re|cover his Right; his <HI>Innocence being guilty of nothing, is afraid of no|thing,</HI> the Righteous is as bold as a <HI>Lyon,</HI> fearing no Enemy, be|cau&s;e he hath ju&s;tly provoked none; his Religion is not the lea&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="5">&s;upport of his valour; He with <HI>David</HI> encourageth Gari&s;ons, and wraps up him&s;elf in his God, where Rea&s;on leaves doubting, their Faith begins in hope even again&s;t hope. In a word, God hath indued His Maje&s;ty with tho&s;e incomparable Graces that are &s;el|dome poured forth any where below the Throne; for what&s;oever things are true, ju&s;t, pure, and lovely, they are in Him; This is the Per&s;on whom God and all Men think worthy of a Kingdom, but tho&s;e over whom He is a King; <HI>(meaning the Phanatique)</HI> the&s;e are the Vertues in who&s;e enjoyment other Nations hug them&s;elves: The&s;e are the Princely Rayes that &s;hine with Maje&s;tick Lu&s;tre in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe:</HI> And this is the great and Chri&s;tian Con|queror, who attributes not any thing to Him&s;elf, but with Holy King <HI>David,</HI> giveth the glory of all to the King of Kings, &s;aying, <HI>I wil not tru&s;t in my Bow, neither &s;hall my Sword &s;ave me: But thou ha&s;t &s;aved us from our enemies, and ha&s;t put them to &s;hame that hated us;</HI> Or, as His Maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed Him&s;elf in His &s;hort Speech to the Mini&s;ters, in his pa&s;&s;age through the City:
