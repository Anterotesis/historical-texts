<P>_THough I am denyed the liberty of the Pulpit, yet I cannot be de|nyed the freedome of the Pre&s;&s;e to publi&s;h the&s;e &s;ad meditati|ons upon the tragicall end <HI>of 2 of Englands VVorthyes:</HI> an Office (I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e) that de&s;erved to be perfor|med by an abler pen, but could not (I am &s;ure have) beene dictated from a more hone&s;t heart; an heart more affected with the worthine&s;&s;e of their lives, or more afflicted for the barbarous &s;uddaine&s;&s;e of their cruel deaths: I forbear to remember what they were, tis recorded in each noble valiant brea&s;t; nor would I have you doubt of what they are, crown'd Conquerors in Heaven, though murdred captives here on earth. Funerall Sermons ought to be, not &s;o much for the <HI>Encomium</HI> of the dead, as the
<PB REF="3">benefit of the living, either by in&s;truction or con|viction; which latter this piece e&s;pecially labours to effect: which I be&s;eech God it may compa&s;&s;e with that &s;ucces, that they, who had an hand them&s;elves, or abetted and countenanced others in this &s;o bloo|dy a deed, being convinc't of their cruelty, may bee &s;truck with remor&s;e and horror at the remembrance of &s;o cur&s;ed a &s;in, which all good men cannot but abhorre, and &s;o doe I.</P>

It is true, they were actors in the work of revenge, but not the manner of acting: the comming of &s;ore &s;elfe &s;ubmitted and wounded men three dayes after a Treaty, and a &s;eeming reconciliation, when they thought them|&s;elves &s;afe, and feared no &s;uch revengefull act, the comming (I &s;ay) upon men at &s;uch a time, and in &s;uch a condition and putting them to death in cold bloud, was the &s;ole de&s;igne of tho&s;e two by name, and was (as the 25. ver&s;e plainly expre&s;&s;eth it) acted by them alone; and therefore in this definitive &s;en|tence which <HI>Jacob</HI> pa&s;&s;ed upon that bloudy fact, and the judge|ment which hee pre-threatned &s;hould fall upon the actors, by their proper names he di&s;tingui&s;heth them two from the re&s;t, and points at them, that &s;o it might be unque&s;tionably evident that they were the men.</P>
