<OPENER><SALUTE>Loving Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received information from you of the pa&s;&s;ages in Eng|land, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give you by this bearer (a friend of mine) notice of our occurrences and proceedings of late in this Kingdome.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>On the 22. of September the great Rebel Oneal came before Mun&s;ter with neer 15000. men, threatning ruine and de&s;truction to all that &s;hould any way re&s;i&s;t them, pretending withall, that he had the Kings authority for what he did: but I conceive that is but a coun|terfeit &s;hew and fal&s;e pretence, where|with he beguiled the ignorant Iri&s;h, ta|king example, as I conceive, of the ma|lignants of your Kingdome, who co|lour all their vvicked and malicious de|&s;ignes under a pretence of &s;tanding for His Maje&s;ty, and the defence of the true Prote&s;tant Religion, when indeed their ends are like his, tending to nothing but ruine and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But we, being well acquainted with his trecherous actions, and knowing that our chief &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ted in Gods protection and our own timely preven|tion, gathered our &s;elves together under the command of our Vice-Pre&s;ident: and though we were but a &s;mall num|ber in compari&s;on of his forces, yet be|ing
<PB N="3" REF="3">put into a martial equipage, we fron|ted boldly, without demanding the cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent arrivall.</P>
<P>This &s;udden and unexpected charge proved very advantagious to us, and di&s;|advantagious to them: for in&s;tead of making good their ground, they lo&s;t their order, which by the continuall motion and &s;triving of the gro&s;&s;e body, was rather more di&s;ordered, then any way recovered, by which meanes our men did very great execution upon the army of the Rebels, routing and &s;cat|tering their maine Batalia, our Troupes of Hor&s;e falling upon their flanks, and trampling the Iri&s;h Kernes like morter upon the ground: it was a kinde of delight to us to heare the mu&s;icke that was made betwixt the Drums &amp; Trum|pets, our &s;houts, and their acclamations, which were much &s;hriller then the Trumpets, and indeed were heard lou|der then any part of the con&s;ort. To be &s;hort, we &s;lew above two hundred of the Rebels forces, and wee lo&s;t not
<PB N="4" REF="4">above twenty five: only &s;ome that were wounded in the pur&s;uit with their wea|pons which were &s;cattered upon the ground, e&s;pecially pikes, and &s;ome skenes, which we re&s;erved; onely the pikes, by rea&s;on that wee wanted wag|gons, wee were commanded to burne them, to the end that they might bee made unfit to be imployd in any &s;ervice again&s;t us. Philomy Oneale was in &s;uch ha&s;te to e&s;cape, that he took up his lodg|ing that night in the woods, &amp; the next day &s;tole away di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a common &s;ouldier. Our Province is cleered neer thirty miles round about.</P>
<P>I received information from the har|bor of Gallway, that the Engli&s;h &s;hips imployed by the Parliament of England have lately had in cha&s;e certain Spani&s;h Frigots, laden with ammunition, which were intended to be landed for the &s;er|vice of the Rebels, but being prevented and clo&s;ely cha&s;ed by the Engli&s;h &s;hips, they &s;trucke into a Creeke &s;ome three miles from Galway, which goes from
<PB N="5" REF="4">the Ocean up to Mun&s;ter, but being un|acquainted with the turnings of the channell, and running with a &s;tiffe fore|right wind, they &s;truck upon a &s;helve, and &s;tuck fa&s;t, &s;o that before they could get their Ordnance a&s;hore to guard their fraught, they were clo&s;e &s;et upon by the Engli&s;h, which were put on &s;hore from the &s;hips in long boats, and they with their rich fraught were &s;eized on to bee imployed again&s;t the Rebels.</P>
<P>The Scotti&s;h Forces under the com|mand of Colonell Le&s;ley have behaved them&s;elves very nobly, and oftentimes put the rebels to the wor&s;t, having taken many Ca&s;tles, and other places of great eminency.</P>
<P>Our Commanders play fal&s;e play, and leave us: My Lord Grandi&s;on hath left his Troupe to the wide world, Captain Bartlet hath for&s;aken us, and Captaine Gib&s;on, with many others. Other our Officers that are re&s;ident with us, play lea&s;t in &s;ight: they have got into &s;trong holds, and doe nothing, but &s;uffer the
<PB N="6" REF="5">Rebels to come up to the very walls of Dublin, doing &s;poile, robbing and plun|dering the inhabitants without contra|diction: Likewi&s;e they pretend, that they are commanded to de&s;i&s;t, but by what authority, they denie to make knowne: but wee have great cau&s;e to feare that they are popi&s;hly affected, and by their practi&s;es do further the commo|tions in England. If we had but &s;ome pre&s;ent &s;upply, we doubt not but to re|cover our pri&s;tine liberty; but if things continue at this &s;tay, we are all de&s;tined to ruine, and the Kingdome mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;sitie be utterly lo&s;t. I pray remember our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed e&s;tate in your prayers, and according to your opportunity let me heare what pa&s;&s;es in England. So in ha&s;t I re&s;t,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your loving brother, J. WALSGRAVE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
