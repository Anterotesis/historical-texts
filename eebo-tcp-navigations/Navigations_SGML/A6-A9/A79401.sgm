<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_A Long preface to a little book, is a Giants head, on a Pigmies &s;houlders: This &s;hall be &s;o &s;hort, as not to &s;pend a line in promi&s;ing bre|vity. The following di&s;cour&s;e really contains <HI>Magnum in parvo;</HI> being of &s;mall bulk, but treating of the greate&s;t Subject, Government: to Au|thorize it, I name the Author
<PB REF="4"><HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That he was a per&s;on of as ex|alted rea&s;on as quality; One Argument pertinent to the mat|ter in hand &s;hall &s;erve, <HI>in&s;tar omnium,</HI> that in the height of pro&s;perity, and flouri&s;hing in reputation, He re&s;igned his Crowns to enjoy him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the day after his re|&s;ignation, was the fir&s;t of his repentance, will appear to them who weigh the grandure of his &s;pirit, and actions, a &s;aying of more &s;harpne&s;s than &s;olid truth; and Calculated to the Meridi|an of their thoughts, who ad|miring Crowns they never po&s;|&s;e&s;s, make their pa&s;&s;ions the mea&s;ure of other mens Actions; and conclude no man can wil|lingly
<PB REF="4">part with what they &s;o vehemently de&s;ire. But the Ge|nius of <HI>Charles</HI> having attain|ed the&s;e altitudes others a&s;pire to, as the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of hu|mane happine&s;s; quitted them to mount into a higher &s;phear. The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ruined, (as it rai&s;ed) it &s;elf, and ha|ving awed all forreign ho&s;tili|ties into &s;ubjection, or allyance; Employed again&s;t it &s;elf, the &s;trength and reputation of its Arms; which had not left in the world an Enemy that de|&s;erved the honour, of falling by &s;o va&s;t a Power. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth held it Greater Glory to Conquer him&s;elf, than the Na|tions he had &s;ubdued: and find|ing no Antagoni&s;t worthy his encounter, like the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB REF="5">State, turned his force again&s;t him&s;elf; but with this diffe|rence, that the <HI>Romans</HI> by Ci|vil War, de&s;troyed their Em|pire; <HI>Charles</HI> by conquering him&s;elf, in vanqui&s;hing tho&s;e ambitious pa&s;&s;ions which reign over Kings, and have Empe|rors their va&s;&s;als; by retyring from the Throne into an Ermi|tage, obtained a Crown more Glo|rious than that he re&s;igned: ha|ving dive&s;ted him&s;elf of tempo|ral honours, to fit him&s;elf for inve&s;titure in Caele&s;tial Dig|nities.</P>
<P>But admitting that &s;aying as true, as 'tis &s;mart and piquante; and that he quitted his Crowns, for fear of lo&s;ing them; it de|rogates not from the authority of his di&s;cour&s;e, nor dimini&s;hes
<PB REF="5">the reputation of his wi&s;dom. For if he had Cau&s;e to fear the lo&s;s of his Crowns, it argues greater prudence, by re&s;ignation to make an happy <HI>Exit</HI> in full felicity; than to outlive his hap|pine&s;s, by &s;eeing his Scepter wre&s;ted out of his hand; and the glorious day of his &s;plen|did triumphs, ending in the di&s;mal Storms of War with his Son, like a new <HI>Phaeton</HI> ju&s;t|ling his Father out of the throne.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e is of Govern|ment, but pre&s;umes not to in|&s;truct our Governours; and thought it may plea&s;e the hu|mour of the times, where Sub|jects are more inqui&s;itive into the duties of Soveraigns, than careful to practi&s;e their own,
<PB REF="6">readier to learn what Princes ought to do, then to perform what Liegemen are bound to: and like the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;es in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;eat, &s;tudy Law and policy, to teach others, not them&s;elves. 'Tis publi&s;hed to do it right, as worthy of publick view, and for publick advantage; For 'tis with men in &s;ociety, as with figures in Arithmetique; they receive their value from the place they &s;tand in: but authority thought it en|largeth the influence, doth not change the nature of per&s;ons; as the figure that &s;ignifies a mil|lion, is the &s;ame as when it denotes One; the greate&s;t King|dom, is but a Society made up of individuals, as the grea|te&s;t numbers are compo&s;ed of
<PB REF="6">the Digits, and the huge&s;t vo|lumes of the Letters of the Al|phabet. The Emperour and his Subjects, being a grand Corpo|ration, as a Major and Com|monalty are a le&s;&s;er, which re|&s;olves into that of Ma&s;ters and Families; and they con&s;i&s;t of particular per&s;ons, whereof eve|ry one is a Corporation in him|&s;elf; as made up of a mind to govern, and a body to obey. 'Tis a maxime in Philo&s;ophy <HI>Simplicia Compo&s;itis priorca:</HI> And the model of Civil Govern|ment, was taken from the na|tural, where the Soul is Sove|raign to direct and command; and the affections and members, are &s;ubjects to obey and exe|cute. Thus private men are Princes; and have a harder Pre|vince,
<PB REF="7">than the greate&s;t Sove|raigns: for tho&s;e lu&s;ts and pa&s;|&s;ions which are private mens Subjects, have reigned over Soveraigns, and conquered Con|querors, who bridled Nations, and governed the greate&s;t Com|munities.</P>
<P>The&s;e are advi&s;es to Govern a Kingdom; but by the trick of <HI>Mutatis Mutandis,</HI> what was de&s;igned only for <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Noke,</HI> may be fitted for <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Styles:</HI> and what <HI>Charles</HI> delivered for a direction to order States, may &s;erve you for in&s;truction to govern your &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVICE OF <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Emperour of <HI>GERMANY,</HI> To his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain:</HI> Upon the Re&s;ignation of his Hereditary Crowns to his &s;aid Son.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO Jewels appear &s;o glori|ous as tho&s;e that embel|li&s;h the Crowns of Princes: Soveraignty is the Mi&s;tre&s;s to
<PB N="2" REF="8">which the Greate&s;t Spirits de|vote their Services; Making the Univer&s;e a Theatre of He|roick Actions, to Ju&s;tifie their Title to the Dignity they Af|fect. This hath made the Re|gal State an Object of Vene|ration or Envy to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l Inferi|ours; and given cau&s;e to Kings to think the Earth a Stage too narrow whereon to di&s;play the Beams of their Ma|je&s;ty, and the Prerogatives of that Condition which hath no Equal under the Sun. This hath rai&s;ed Ambition to that height, that Men trample on all Rights, Civil or Sacred, that ob&s;truct their pa&s;&s;age to the Throne: And even deve&s;t them&s;elves of Humanity, in offering violence to the Laws
<PB N="3" REF="8">of Nature, that they may with more &s;ecurity put on and wear the Royal Purple; &s;acrificing the Lives of neare&s;t Relations to the Intere&s;t of the Crown. Hence it is that the Examples of Quitting Crowns, and Re|&s;igning Scepters, are &s;o rare, that &s;ucceeding Ages enter|tain the Relation thereof as Fancies, rather than Hi&s;torical Truths. So natural to Man is the thir&s;t of Independant Freedom, that the Quitting of that which all de&s;ire to en|joy, &s;eems a Paradox not to be e&s;teemed true in any Ca&s;e, but Theirs, who by their in|capacity to u&s;e that Excellent Priviledge, are unworthy to enjoy it; or by pretending a Voluntary Re&s;ignation, think
<PB N="4" REF="9">to palliate their Weakne&s;s, and hide their Di&s;ability to hold that Scepter, which if not yielded, would be wre&s;t|ed from them. Like tho&s;e vain Sophi&s;ts, who decried Riches, not out of a real Con|tempt of them, but becau&s;e they wanted them, and knew not how to gain them.</P>
<P>The value of Gifts depends much on the Knowledge or Ignorance of the Donor, in proportion to which, it ri&s;es and falls: The mo&s;t magnifi|cent Pre&s;ent from the hand of him that e&s;teems it mean, be|comes common, and lays on the Receiver an Obligation not an&s;werable to the intrin|&s;ique value of the Gift, but &s;uitable to the E&s;timat of the
<PB N="5" REF="9">Giver, which like the Princes Stamp, often makes the &s;ame Piece Currant, at a higher and lower Rate: A Wedge of Gold be&s;tow'd by an Ameri|can, who thinks Gla&s;s more precious, de&s;erves only the &s;mall Acknowledgements due for a Pre&s;ent of Gla&s;s, not of Gold. What I have &s;aid of the Excellency of the Regal State, infers not an Alteration of my declared Re&s;olution to Refign my Diadems to you; but that as you &s;hall receive a Gift of the Greate&s;t Magni|tude, it comes from my hand, who perfectly know the tran|&s;cendant value of what I give. And that you may &s;ee your Obligations to me, as my Bounty to you, equally &s;uper|lative;
<PB N="6" REF="10">and read my Exce&s;s of Kindne&s;s for your Per&s;on, and high e&s;teem of your Abilities in the Character of that Love which hath engag'd me freely to transfer from my &s;elf to you the Supreme Authority, to which the Greate&s;t Per&s;ons in pa&s;t Ages, have a&s;pired with that Ardency, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with that Jealou&s;ie, that Sons, Fathers, and Brothers fell Vi|ctims to their Pa&s;&s;ions, for Gaining or Keeping the Throne; though they, if de|ve&s;ted of that Soveraign Dig|nity, would have redeemed with their own, the Lives of their Relations.</P>
<P>That no Man Re&s;igns the Royal Power, but for Incapa|city to manage, or Fear to lo&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="10">it, will be henceforth li&s;ted in the Catalogue of Vulgar Er|rours, upon the convincing Evidence of my &s;ingle In|&s;tance; who can without Va|nity call <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Afri&abque;</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> to te&s;tifie my Ability to &s;way and keep the Scepter in my hands; having fix'd &s;o many recent Trophies of Conduct and Valour in the&s;e parts of the World, that the Antipodes mu&s;t be &s;earch|ed to find out an Enemy who may dare to attaque that Per|&s;on, who&s;e Prudence and Prowe&s;s have gain'd him the Honour to be rank'd among&s;t the greate&s;t Heroes.</P>
<P>Animals arrived at the years of maturity, are naturally in|clin'd to pre&s;erve their Spe|cies
<PB N="8" REF="11">by Propagation, and de|light in the Productions of their kind: It is my de&s;ire, and will be my greate&s;t plea&s;ure, to &s;ee the exerci&s;e of the&s;e great Politique Vertues con|&s;picuous in my Actions, conti|nued by you; and to behold my Qualities and Dignities, as well as my Per&s;on, &s;urvive my &s;elf in you the Image of my Per&s;on, the actual Heir of my Dignities, and emulous Imita|tor of my Examples.</P>
<P>The Sun, who in his Meri|dian &mdash; Chariot guilds the World with glorious Beams, equally admirable as profitable to the Univer&s;e, withdraws at Night to re&s;t in the Curtains of his beloved <HI>Thetis;</HI> that Mortals, who prize good
<PB N="9" REF="11">things more by Privation than Fruition of them, may be taught by the Darkne&s;s that en&s;ues his Retirement, to wi&s;h for and receive his morning Light with due Re&s;pect: I am now re&s;olved to confine my &s;elf to the Privacies of a Religious Hou&s;e, that the &s;ud|den Ecclip&s;e of a Per&s;on who&s;e Influence hath made this Empire and other States to flouri&s;h many years, may cau&s;e them to fix their Eyes on you, as the Ri&s;ing Sun; and with full Acclamations promi&s;e them&s;elves from your good Government, the continuance of that Happine&s;s they enjoy|ed under mine: And look up|on you, not as <HI>Philip</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> but as <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="12">Fifth, revived like a Phoenix out of his own A&s;hes, to re|new the cour&s;e of his youth|ful Triumphs.</P>
<P>That you may an&s;wer their Expectations, before I Re&s;ign my Crowns into your hands, I &s;hall give you &s;ome Directions which you are to e&s;teem as highly as the&s;e Diadems, which have derived their Ma|je&s;tique Lu&s;tre on my Head, from the Rules you &s;hall re|ceive, more than from tho&s;e Orient Diamonds that adorn them.</P>
<P>'Tis not my Intention to mind you here of tho&s;e Du|ties of Piety to God, Tempe|rance, and Magnanimity in your Actions, and Ju&s;tice to your Subjects; which are the
<PB N="11" REF="12">Ba&s;is of Thrones, and Pillars of Soveraignty: For that I am &s;atisfied by your Practice, that you have heartily embra|ced tho&s;e Excellent Princi|ples of your Education: And that whether you conver&s;e with the pre&s;e~nt or pa&s;t Ages, you cannot want frequent Ad|monitions by Men or Books, to urge the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Fundamental Vertues. My De&s;ign is, to commend to your Ob&s;ervation &s;ome Rules and Maximes which my Experi|ence, as Emperour and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> hath confirmed u&s;eful in the Government of tho&s;e States I &s;hall Re&s;ign into your Hands.</P>
<P>When you con&s;ider the nu|merous Dominions you are to
<PB N="12" REF="13">&s;ucceed in, in <HI>Spain, Flanders, Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> with the different Con&s;titutions and Inclinations of the People, the variety of their Laws and Politique Intere&s;ts, you will pre&s;ently conclude, That great Governments are great Bur|dens; and the Prerogatives you enjoy above other Prin|ces, are but Intimations and Marks of greater Cares and weightier Duties incumbent on you. The Cares of a Pilot are circum&s;crib'd within the narrow Compa&s;s of the Ship he guides; but tho&s;e of an Admiral extend to the whole Fleet: The vigilance of other Princes, like the &s;ingle States they Rule, is &s;hort and nar|row; yours mu&s;t be propor|tionable
<PB N="13" REF="13">to your Dominions, dilated from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and reach even to a New World. But that you may not be di&s;couraged at the Troubles that attend your Greatne&s;s, Remember that as your Government is more Weighty and Large, &s;o will your Glory be; which will run parallel with your Cares, and make you Renowned in tho&s;e Remote Regions where the Names of other Princes are never heard of.</P>
<P>To advi&s;e a Great Prince to be content with the Domini|ons he is born to, may &s;eem ab|&s;urd to them who judge Con|tentment a private Vertue on|ly, and extol an In&s;atiable Ambition as the greate&s;t Glo|ry
<PB N="14" REF="14">of a King. But tho&s;e Rules of Ju&s;tice that prohibit Inju|ries between private Men, do &s;o much the more oblige Prin|ces not to violate the Rights of their weaker Neighbours, as the Con&s;equences of their Actions are more generally fa|tal, involving not Families on|ly, but Nations in Common Ruine; And as Princes, who are the Fountains, ought al&s;o to be the Examples of Ju&s;tice to other Men. Be&s;ides, I look on the Empire as &s;well'd to that Bulk, that to adde to it, were to cram meat into a full Stomach, which will not nou|ri&s;h the Body, but oppre&s;s the Concoctive Faculty, and render it incapable to dige&s;t the Aliment it had received
<PB N="15" REF="14">before. Sure I am, it will be more acceptable with God, and plea&s;ing to men, for you to pre&s;erve the Grandeur of your E&s;tates by good Govern|ment, than by a wilde Ambi|tion of New Conque&s;ts, to hazard your Hereditary Crowns.</P>
<P>The Life of a Prince is like the Body of the Sun, which draws the Eyes of all Mortals towards him, and is as con&s;pi|cuous as the Rays of Light: To think the bad Actions of a Prince can e&s;cape di&s;covery, is to believe the Sun-Beams invi&s;ible. 'Tis beneath your Dignity to do any thing that may fear the Cen&s;ure, or not abide the Te&s;t of the whole World. And when you re|flect
<PB N="16" REF="15">upon the Juri&s;diction of Princes, that it extends only to the Hands and Tongues, but reaches not the Thoughts and Conceptions of their Sub|jects, which are exempt from Earthly Powers, and triable in that Court only where the Gods of the Earth &s;tand at the Bar to accompt for their Acti|ons, it will appear that though the bad Actions of a Prince may e&s;cape the La&s;h of his Subjects Tongues, and the violence of Revenge, they will be certainly Arraigned, Sentenc'd, and Condemned in their private Thoughts, which fear not the Rigor of Humane Laws, nor the Treacherous Malice of Informers. And the Sentences pronounced
<PB N="17" REF="15">there, will be readily execu|ted, when a fit occa&s;ion pro|mi&s;es Indempnity; and with &s;o much the more eagerne&s;s and virulency as their former fear to expre&s;s their Grievan|ces was great: Like hidden Fires, that bur&s;t forth in more violent Eruptions. The end of this Di&s;cour&s;e, is, to per|&s;wade you to &s;uch a Comport|ment as becomes your Digni|ty, and may &s;atisfie your Peo|ple that they are happy under your Conduct, by the Prote|ction and Security they re|ceive from your Care and Vigilance, in recompence of tho&s;e Duties of Subjection and Obedience they pay you. This will beget an intire Con|fidence on their part in your
<PB N="18" REF="16">Prudence and Goodne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;h your Throne in the Hearts and Affections of your People. And though it be much controverted whether Princes are more &s;ecure in the Love or Fear of their People, I commend it to you as my &s;ence, That the &s;ecurity of Government depends more on the Love than Fear of the Sub|ject: And take it as my Advice to choo&s;e the way of &s;weet|ne&s;s and Clemency to make your Throne durable, rather than that of Violence and Ri|gor, to render your &s;elf more ab&s;olute; but withal to entail the hatred of the People on your Po&s;terity. How fatal it hath been to Princes to pre&s;s their People with exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="19" REF="16">&s;everities, appears by tho&s;e Examples, where the Tyran|ny of the Old, forceth the People to entertain thoughts of New Ma&s;ters; who are ne|ver wanting to invite them to Di&s;loyalty, by Promi&s;es of Ea&s;e and better U&s;age: And the People, willing to believe what they pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h, are ea&s;ily per&s;waded to change that Condition than which they think none can be wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It is a vain Opinion, That the Security of Governours con|&s;i&s;ts in the Poverty or Slavery of their <HI>People,</HI> whom you mu&s;t deve&s;t of Humanity, before you can render them &s;en&s;e|le&s;s of tho&s;e Pre&s;&s;ures and Mi|&s;eries that attend a needy and
<PB N="20" REF="17">&s;ervile Condition; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for men under Pre&s;|&s;ures and Mi&s;eries, not to de|&s;ire Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s. And how frequent opportunities a Politique Body may have to attain their de&s;ires in this kind, is &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated by the hatred that attends Tyranny, the natural itch of Innovation, and Subtleties of Ambitious Men, who never fail to improve all occa&s;ions to rai&s;e their Fortunes on the Ruines of their Superiours.</P>
<P>It is the happine&s;s of Prin|ces, that the things which na|turally procure the Love of the People, are al&s;o mo&s;t wor|thy the practice of the Prince: And that it is their Intere&s;t to exerci&s;e tho&s;e Vertues which
<PB N="21" REF="17">they are obliged to embrace for their Native Beauty and Excellency, though Naked and De&s;titute of Forraign Advantages. What can more become a Prince, than the Religious ob&s;ervance of Faith, Continence, and Ju&s;tice? And what can more endear him in the Affections of his Peo|ple, than the practice of the&s;e Vertues, which will infallibly beget an intire Confidence in his Goodne&s;s, a hearty Kind|ne&s;s and Love for his Govern|ment, and a &s;incere Venera|tion and Reverent Regard for his Per&s;on and State: Faith in your proceedings, and keep|ing your Word, will gain Cre|dit to your Promi&s;es at home and abroad; and the re&s;pects
<PB N="22" REF="18">due to a Generous and Noble Prince, who&s;e Word hath &s;ome re&s;emblance with that of God, which never deceives them that rely on it. Conti|nence will make your Per&s;on venerable; and be&s;ides the in|fluence of your good Exam|ple will convince your People of the excellency of your Ver|tue, who being above the power of Law, are a Law to your &s;elf; and by a volunta|ry Election and generous In|clination to Goodne&s;s, can keep within due bounds that unruly Pa&s;&s;ion which hath left a &s;tain on the Names of the greate&s;t Monarchs, and the Severity of Laws and Ri|gor of Puni&s;hments cannot regulate in meaner men;
<PB N="23" REF="18">whom you can then freely re|prove of tho&s;e Vices, which if guilty your &s;elf, you could not without Blu&s;hing rebuke in others. Your Ju&s;tice will fill your Dominions with Men of Worth and Merit, who &s;ee|ing the Way to Honours and Pre&s;erments open only through the Temple of Ver|tue, will become Votaries to Goodne&s;s, that they may re|ceive from your Ju&s;tice the Rewards due to excellent A|ctions, and e&s;cape tho&s;e Pu|ni&s;hments and Di&s;graces your ju&s;t Severity inflicts on Vice and Wickedne&s;s. The&s;e Ver|tues will implant in your Sub|jects Minds &s;uch E&s;teem for your Per&s;on, and Opinion of your Goodne&s;s, that when
<PB N="24" REF="19">any mi&s;carriage in Govern|ment happens by Inju&s;tice, or otherwi&s;e, they will impute it to the failings of your Mi|ni&s;ters; Judging it as impo&s;&s;i|ble for you to deviate from your Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, as the Sun to vary his con&s;tant Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Affairs of Princes are divided between Peace and War, which have their parti|cular Ways and di&s;tinct Rules of Management, and afford Occa&s;ions for the Exerci&s;e of different Vertues: It is the prudence of a Prince to make the one &s;ub&s;ervient to the o|ther; and in the Sun-&s;hine of Peace to provide for the Storms of War, which is a time of Expence, as the other
<PB N="25" REF="19">is of Gain: Both have proper and peculiar Arts, wherein the dexterity of a Prince is much &s;een, in u&s;ing both to be&s;t advantage. And as the be&s;t end of War, is Peace; &s;o a wi&s;e Prince in the Securities of a deep Peace, hath War in pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The certain Charge that attends the Conduct of great States, is &s;o va&s;t, and the E|mergencies that may require extraordinary Expence, &s;o frequent and various, that Frugality and good Husban|dry ju&s;tly claim an honourable place in the Quire of Royal Vertues, it being impo&s;&s;ible to act tho&s;e great things that become a Prince, and make Thrones Renowned, without
<PB N="26" REF="20">a &s;tock of money to &s;upply their Occa&s;ions; the provi&s;i|on whereof, as it denominates a Prince frugal and prudent, &s;o it &s;trikes terror into his Enemies, procures re&s;pect from his Allies, reverencee from his Subjects, and lies in readine&s;s to &s;erve his Glory: Whereas Contempt is the in|&s;eparable Companion of Po|verty, though &s;itting in a Throne, and adorn'd with a Diadem.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep to make your &s;elf rich, is to make your Peo|ple &s;o; and that your Trea|&s;ure may be full, endeavour that theirs may abound and o|ver-flow. Let it be your principal care to &s;ecure their Traffique, and protect them in
<PB N="27" REF="20">their Commerce. This, be|&s;ides the advantage of your Exchequer by your Cu&s;toms, will win you the Affections of your People, whom nothing plea&s;eth more than the in|crea&s;e of Wealth, which makes them e&s;teem him the be&s;t Prince under whom they thrive mo&s;t. The improve|ment of their E&s;tates is a &s;en&s;i|ble benefit and effect of your Protection, and an Argument &s;o convincing and demon&s;tra|tive of good Government, that they yield a voluntary and chearful obedience to that Regiment from which they derive &s;uch real and palpable advantages; and will e&s;teem it a Priviledge, not a Burden, to obey. When you are thus
<PB N="28" REF="21">become Ma&s;ter of their hearts, you may at a pinch command their Pur&s;es, who cannot but hold them&s;elves obliged in good Nature and Intere&s;t, to part with a pittance to &s;up|ply his Nece&s;&s;ities, to who&s;e Care and Protection they owe their Abundance; and may expect an increa&s;e of their &s;tore, by the Continuance of his Favour, as their denyal may incline him by remi&s;sne&s;s and neglect of their Concerns, to expo&s;e what they profe&s;s to hazard and danger; and da&s;h all hopes of future im|provement.</P>
<P>It will be a &s;ingular means to gain E&s;teem and Love from your People, if you make Provi&s;ion of Nece&s;&s;aries a|gain&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="21">times of Dearth; And by affording them at rea&s;ona|ble Rates for Relief of their Wants, it will appear to them that you prefer publique Sa|tisfaction before your private Benefit: And the Reputation of your prudent Fore-&s;ight and Care for their Good, will implant in them a &s;olid Love for your Per&s;on, and E&s;teem for your Conduct, than which nothing can be of more advantage in the Cour&s;e of your Affairs. No Bene|fits leave &s;o deep impre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e that come &s;ea&s;onably for Relief of Nece&s;&s;ities; which being a clear Evidence of your Love to your Sub|jects, will beget a reciprocal Love from them. 'Tis vain
<PB N="30" REF="22">to think a Grieved People can be Courted to forget their Mi&s;eries by Sports and Pa|&s;times, or fooled out of the memory of their Sufferings, into Affection to their Op|pre&s;&s;ors, by Shews and Specta|cles, which may for a moment plea&s;e the fancy; but work not any other Effects than meerly &s;uperficial, as light and emp|ty, as vain and tran&s;itory, as their Cau&s;es: The Bonds of Policy are real and ponde|rous, and Subjection a &s;erious thing, which affects &s;o deeply the Hearts of Men, that no|thing but the &s;en&s;ible Effects of a viligant Protection, derived to them by &s;olid Advantages from their &s;uperiours, can make them love tho&s;e Chains
<PB N="31" REF="22">which Nature abhors.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the Nece&s;&s;ities of State may often force you to pre&s;s your People to extra|ordinary Supplies, by Taxes and Impo&s;itions; you are to con&s;ider that the power of a Prince depends upon his Peo|ples Conformity to his Dire|ctions, and uniform a&s;&s;ent to &s;erve and honour him. And ina&s;much as nothing touches them more nearly in their E|&s;tates and Fortunes (the Blood of the People) than the Exa|ction of New Aids, that Gol|den Mean which is the be&s;t Rule of Humane Actions, is to be ob&s;erved accurately in the&s;e Affairs: And you are to take &s;pecial heed not to &s;train the &s;trings of your Power too
<PB N="32" REF="23">high, to prevent tho&s;e Jars and Di&s;cords that u&s;ually di&s;|order the whole harmony of Government on the&s;e occa&s;i|ons. And though in this ad|vice I may &s;eem to contradict my own practice, having often burdened my People with Taxes and Impo&s;itions; I have this to ju&s;tifie my A&s;&s;er|tions, that I never took that Cour&s;e, but forced by indi&s;|pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ities of my Wars, nor made u&s;e of it but again&s;t my Will; and that I never had encouragement from the effects it wrought in my Peoples Hearts to reite|rate the practice.</P>
<P>To give you &s;ome Directi|ons in a matter of &s;o great mo|ment; I ob&s;erve that Moneys
<PB N="33" REF="23">are drawn by Princes from their Subjects two ways, vo|luntary and compul&s;ive: I call that voluntary, when the Sub|ject does, as by Contract, re|ceive <HI>quid pro quo</HI> from his Soveraign, in &s;ome particular Benefit, for the Money he pays; as in the &s;ale of Offices, farming of Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Com|pul&s;ive, when no particular re|compence is made by the Prince for what he receives, and the Subjects Money exa|cted from him: for though in truth, when Taxes and Im|po&s;itions are rai&s;ed to &s;erve Publique Nece&s;&s;ities, and im|ployed accordingly, the <HI>Prince</HI> is but the <HI>Peoples</HI> Steward, to di&s;po&s;e of their Aids for their benefit, wherein they receive
<PB N="34" REF="24">the recompence of their Sup|plies: Yet the&s;e Benefits being commonly remote, general, and diffu&s;ive, pa&s;s as it were invi&s;ible and unperceived, by the particular Members of the Body politique, who are little affected with any Advantage, but what &s;en&s;ibly accrues to them in their private Con|cerns. This is the rea&s;on why this later &s;eems &s;o har&s;h, and the other plea&s;ant to the <HI>Peo|ple;</HI> and may incline you to u&s;e this, rather than that. The Court of <HI>Rome</HI> may encourage all <HI>Princes</HI> &s;tudious of their profit, to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ale of Offices, as a great Help to fill their Trea&s;ures; which is clearly proved by the experi|ence of the <HI>Papacy:</HI> for be
<PB N="35" REF="24">the Church never &s;o poor in the Vacancy of the See, the &s;ucceeding Pope never fails to furni&s;h him&s;elf abundantly in the very entrance of his reign by this &s;ingle means of the &s;ale of Offices.</P>
<P>That other way of Supply by Taxes and Impo&s;itions, is not &s;o odious, but by dextrous management, di&s;creet Officers, and pre&s;idents of other Coun|treys under heavier Burdens, it may be practi&s;ed without inconvenience. But it will concern the <HI>Prince</HI> by ea&s;ie Acce&s;s, kind Reception, &s;atis|factory An&s;wers, and obliging Carriage, and by making out the Nece&s;&s;ities that occa&s;ion this Grievance, to &s;weeten the Affections of the people into
<PB N="36" REF="25">a Belief that he hath not taken this cour&s;e willingly, but com|pelled by urgent Occurents of State, and for the defence or other advantage of his Sub|jects. And in levying the&s;e Impo&s;itions, whether tempora|ry or perpetual, have a watch|ful Eye on your Officers, le&s;t by Exactions and Violences they adde to the <HI>Peoples</HI> mi&s;e|ries, and render them le&s;s able to furni&s;h you another time.</P>
<P>Never impo&s;e high Cu&s;toms on tho&s;e things which are im|ported or exported to &s;erve the Nece&s;&s;ities of the place; for in that ca&s;e the moderate Cu&s;tom makes the greater vent, and proves more advan|tagious than heavy Impo&s;iti|ons, which di&s;courage Trade,
<PB N="37" REF="25">and not onely deprive the place of Nece&s;&s;aries for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance, but &s;top the &s;ale of tho&s;e Superfluities it can &s;pare, by the thin re&s;ort of forraign Merchants, where Great Cu&s;toms devour the Gains of tho&s;e that Traffique. To impo&s;e high Cu&s;toms on forraign Superfluities impor|ted, is not only ju&s;t, in ma|king them that affect tho&s;e Novelties pay dear for their Fancies, but in deterring o|thers from the vanity of ex|pending on tho&s;e Trifles the Moneys that may be otherwi&s;e better employed.</P>
<P>Allow convenient time for payment of your Taxes, and let them be gathered by ordi|nary Officers, not new Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="38" REF="26">who&s;e violence commonly exa&s;perates the people to the danger of the State. In a word, chu&s;e ra|ther to pawn or &s;ell part of your Revenue to &s;upply your Occa&s;ions, than by encrea&s;ing the peoples Burdens, to force them to a de&s;ire of Change. And when Nece&s;&s;ity leaves no other way open, con&s;ider the nature of the places you Tax, what they can be&s;t furni&s;h you withal; as <HI>Spain,</HI> with Money; <HI>Germany,</HI> Men; <HI>Italy,</HI> both Money and Men. Some|times ingratiate your &s;elf with the people by a volun|tary Remi&s;&s;ion of part of the A&s;&s;e&s;sments; and let all mat|ters of Grace flow to them immediately from your &s;elf,
<PB N="39" REF="26">and refer to your Mini&s;ters what is har&s;h and odious. Above all, &s;ee that what is &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed with the peoples groans and your dan|ger, be brought to your Pur&s;e, and not diverted to the pri|vate profit of your Officers. Keep Credit with the Mer|chants, protect them in their Trade, and &s;ecure their Com|merce; e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who&s;e Loans you will find u&s;eful in many Emergen|cies, which may require quicker &s;upplies than can be rai&s;ed by the ordinary ways of Tax and Impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of an able Council, is evidently gathered from the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of di&s;patching the Affairs
<PB N="40" REF="27">of State, by a &s;ingle per&s;on, though of prodigious Abili|ties: And that &s;everal Princes of di&s;&s;olute Lives, and weak Capacities, have reigned with honour to the State, and to the &s;atisfaction of their peo|ple, meerly by the prudence and faithfulne&s;s of their Mi|ni&s;ters; to whom the great|e&s;t Princes owe mo&s;t of their Glory, as the <HI>Atlas</HI>'s of their Government, on who&s;e &s;houl|ders they are triumphantly carried through the Difficul|ties of Policy, into the Tem|ples of Immortal Honour.</P>
<P>Your Wi&s;dom cannot ap|pear in any thing more, than in the choice of fit per&s;ons to &s;erve you in your weighty Affairs, by Coun&s;el and Exe|cution.
<PB N="41" REF="27">And the better to guide your Election, think no man worthy employment un|der you, but &s;uch who&s;e Wi&s;|dom enables them to di&s;charge their Tru&s;t to be&s;t advantage, and &s;ecure them from tho&s;e Inconveniencies wherein men are involved by Ignorance and Imprudence. And le&s;t pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t &s;hould incline them to employ their Talents to your prejudice; and &s;tudy their own, more than your In|tere&s;t and Honour: Your next care mu&s;t be, That their Wi&s;dom be attended with a generous Faithfulne&s;s to di&s;|charge their Tru&s;t, intire Love for your <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and a vertuous Di&s;po&s;ition, with|out which, it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="42" REF="28">to give the people &s;atisfa|ction, when the &s;candalous Lives of your Mini&s;ters &s;hall give them cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect all their Actions, and to pre&s;age nothing but Ruine to the State from their Conduct who cannot govern them&s;elves. Tis an excellent Secret, and one of the prime My&s;teries in the Art of Government, for a <HI>Prince</HI> incapable to manage Affairs of State, to cover his Defects by employing men of Excellent Abilities, well-di&s;|po&s;ed, and faithful to his Crown. The Glory of their Actions redounds to the <HI>Prince;</HI> and the people, never curious to enquire from what hand they receive their Hap|pine&s;s, re&s;t &s;o well &s;atified
<PB N="43" REF="28">with the Effect, that they care not to pry into the Cau&s;e, but applaud him an Excellent <HI>Prince,</HI> under whom they en|joy peace and plenty, though perhaps he contributes little to the Felicity they live in.</P>
<P>The Advantages of Honour and Profit that attend the &s;er|vice of <HI>Princes,</HI> attract multi|tudes to &s;eek and pre&s;s for im|ployment; but you are to re|member that mo&s;t of the&s;e men come to &s;erve their ambi|tious and covetous Humours, not the Intere&s;t and Honour of the State. But as I will not condemn all that catch at em|ployment, and offer their &s;er|vices, &s;o I advi&s;e you to think your be&s;t diligence well laid out, to find men in all places
<PB N="44" REF="29">of your Dominions, fit to &s;erve you; and having found them, to e&s;teem your Trea|&s;ures of Wealth and Honour never better expended than in encouraging &s;uch men by am|ple Rewards, and obliging them more &s;trictly to your per&s;on and intere&s;t: The ra|ther, for that the World affords numbers of excellent per&s;ons, who in private For|tunes have princely Spirits, elevated to that pitch, that they admire not Riches or Ho|nours, but prefer the Liberty of an ob&s;cure Retirement, be|fore the &s;plendid Servitude of high Employments. Yet the&s;e men, when drawn forth to appear on the Theatre of State, have acted their parts
<PB N="45" REF="29">with &s;ingular Dexterity, incomparable Integrity, and admired Courage. And &s;ettle it for a Maxime, That in mat|ters of importance, a prudent and couragious Coun&s;ellor may promote your de&s;igns by his &s;ound Advice, more than Legions of Souldiers, and whole Mountains of Trea&s;ure. And you may ob&s;erve that the greate&s;t <HI>Princes</HI> in all Ages have made choice of, and been &s;erved by the able&s;t Mini&s;ters; whereof <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the greate&s;t <HI>Prince</HI> in my Judgement, for Peace and War, that ever ap|peared on the Stage of the World, is a &s;ufficient In&s;tance; No Age having produced a <HI>Prince</HI> equal to him, or a <HI>Prin|ces</HI> Mini&s;ters comparable to
<PB N="46" REF="30">tho&s;e he employ'd. The Rea|&s;on is obvious, <HI>Like will to like:</HI> And a gallant <HI>Prince</HI> pre&s;ently di&s;covers the Weakne&s;s of a Mini&s;ter, and &s;lights him; as a weak <HI>Prince</HI> comprehends not the Excellencies, and therefore &s;eldom u&s;es the Ser|vice of an able Officer.</P>
<P>'Tis u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the Genius of your Officers, and fit them with Employments &s;uitable to their Inclinations and particular Ex|cellencies: For a Mini&s;ter who may perform Excellent Services to your Crown in <HI>Spain,</HI> if employed in <HI>Italy</HI> may prejudice your Affairs there, which are to be carried on with other Maximes, and manag'd by per&s;ons of tempers
<PB N="47" REF="30">different from your <HI>Spani&s;h Mi|ni&s;ters.</HI> In the choice of Gene|rals and Captains of Armies, this Rule is of &s;ingular benefit, which may appear by that eminent Example of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> inferiour to none in Conduct or Succe&s;s in Land-Wars, but mo&s;t unhappy in Naval En|gagements: So rare a thing is a man ab&s;olutely wi&s;e, that can at all times, in all places, and on all occa&s;ions, merit the prai&s;e of a dextrous Mi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the date of your Hap|pine&s;s expire with the Lives of your able Coun&s;ellors, fail not to train up others for your &s;ervice, in the life-time and under the tuition of your greate&s;t Mini&s;ters, to be a
<PB N="48" REF="31">Nur&s;ery of gallant per&s;ons, who&s;e eminent Abilities and worthy Actions, may perpe|tuate the Felicity of your E&s;tates. Take the Romans for your Example, who to pre|vent the Inconvenience might en&s;ue the leaving the &s;tre&s;s of their great Affairs, to rely and depend on the Life of a &s;ingle per&s;on, in all their Armies made provi&s;ion of &s;everal able Commanders a&s;&s;igned to &s;uc|ceed in the Office of General, in ca&s;e of mi&s;adventure to the per&s;on actually officiating the Chief Charge.</P>
<P>Never hazard matters of Importance in a time of dan|ger, upon their management, who were never employed in Affairs of equal weight: In
<PB N="49" REF="31">which Ca&s;es you are to prefer the experience of your Anci|ent, before the Humours of your younger Coun&s;el|lors.</P>
<P>'Tis a common Ob&s;ervation that young men are generally bold and credulous, as old men fearful and &s;u&s;pitious; therefore in the choice of Coun&s;ellors, re&s;pect chiefly the middle Age, as a mean be|tween tho&s;e Extreams: But rely mo&s;t on their Advice, who have given proof of their &s;ufficiency in dangerous occa|&s;ions, and are grown gray with the Cares of Government; who&s;e Experience may tune the di&s;&s;onant Humours of jarring Councils to a perfect Harmony: But think not I
<PB N="50" REF="32">exclude young or old men from your Councils, for the Common Ob&s;ervation like General Rules hath its excep|tions in many In&s;tances of young men of ripe Under&s;tan|dings, and old ones of flouri|&s;hing Wits and warm Courage. I rather commend to your imitation that Roman Medley where the heat of young men was tempered by the cool and &s;taid prudence of gray-heads, and the quinte&s;&s;ence of both concurred in men of middle Age, who partaking of the vigorous Heat of the former, and &s;ober Wi&s;dom of the lat|ter, were excellent both for Coun&s;el and Execution, and together made up the Body of a Roman Senate.</P>

<P>The Ancient Greeks, in four famous Examples, have intimated to us four &s;pecial means to attain Wi&s;dom.</P>

<P>The &s;econd is by Hi&s;tories and Memories, which in &s;mall Volumns comprehending the Tran&s;actions of many Ages, afford In&s;tructions u&s;eful in Occurrences of the pre&s;ent Times, and furni&s;h the Rea|der with Examples of all &s;orts, di&s;covering not only the mi&s;|carriages

<P>The fourth in <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> by long Life, where one Le&s;&s;on learnt yearly, &s;wells at la&s;t to a Sy&s;tem of Wi&s;dom. When all the&s;e concur in one per&s;on, they make his per&s;on reve|rend, and his Coun&s;els Oracles.</P>

<P>The &s;econd qualification of a Mini&s;ter, is, That he be a Good Man: Where the ex|qui&s;it Arts of Hypocri&s;ie, tho&s;e invi&s;ible Deceits and Laby|rinths in the hearts of Men, have made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pronounce a right Sen|tence

<P>It was the Cu&s;tom of the Romans in the height of their Power, and is now the Turk|i&s;h Cu&s;tom to bring prodigi|ous numbers of men into the field: but the great Victories the Romans obtained before
<PB N="79" REF="46">with &s;mall numbers again&s;t va&s;t multitudes of the barba|rous Nations, And the Con|que&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> by tho&s;e few Troops which made up <HI>Alex|anders</HI> Army, do clearly de|mon&s;trate that huge Bodies of Armed men are more for &s;how than &s;ervice; more fit for o&s;tentation, as Marks of Pow|er, than requi&s;ite to bring Enterprizes to effect; which they ob&s;truct more by their confu&s;ed multitudes, than they promote by their &s;eem|ing &s;trength; Experience ha|ving taught us, That the grea|ter part were Spectators only, not Actors in the Battel. This hath induced me to concur with the Modern Captains in their opinion, That thirty
<PB N="80" REF="47">thou&s;and Foot and four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, or there|abouts, may &s;tand for a com|pleat Army, without Exce&s;s or Defect, as a Number requi|&s;it to &s;erve the De&s;igns of a Prince, and &s;ufficient for the greate&s;t Undertakings, ea&s;ier di&s;ciplin'd, paid, and provi|ded for, than greater Bodies, mo&s;t agreeable to the Modern Art of War. And as the Vi|ctories obtained by &s;uch rea|&s;onable Forces are more ho|nourable, &s;o in truth 'tis rare to &s;ee a place &s;o free from Ditches, Rivers, Woods, Lakes, Mountains, and other Impediments, as to be capa|ble of a greater Number in Battel Array.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, We &s;ee that the
<PB N="81" REF="47">Turk lays the &s;tre&s;s of his Battels, and builds the Glory of his Victories, not on tho&s;e infinite multitudes which &s;well his Camp, but on the Valour and Experience of tho&s;e few Regiments of <HI>Jani|zaries</HI> that attend him, as <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> placed more confidence in his tenth Legion than in all the re&s;t of his Army, though the far greater Num|ber and no mean Souldiers. And as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> notwith&s;tanding the detriment by Battel and other Accidents, did by con|&s;tant &s;upplies pre&s;erve that Legion always intire, &s;o mu&s;t a Prince take care by new for|ces to make up the number of tho&s;e Companies which the fate of War, the nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="82" REF="48">Garri&s;ons, or other Occa&s;ions, &s;hall withdraw from his Army, which mu&s;t be maintained in the full number we have pre|&s;cribed. And &s;upplies of new men may be rationally thought to increa&s;e the Gal|lantry of an Army, in that their want of experience makes them run more boldly into tho&s;e dangers which the try'd Souldier cunningly de|clines, or meets with cau|tion.</P>
<P>Next the proportion of your Army, the Di&s;cipline of your Camp claims your dili|gence: And herein be &s;ure to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Rules that the Principles of Religion and Ju&s;tice, may flouri&s;h there, that your Souldiers may pay
<PB N="83" REF="48">the Duty they owe to God, who is Lord of Ho&s;ts, and to them&s;elves in a vertuous and hone&s;t Life, which mu&s;t be attended with obedience and due re&s;pect to their General and all &s;ubordinate Officers: To effect this, encourage the Dutiful by Rewards and Ho|nours, and puni&s;h the Stub|born and Contumacious by Di&s;graces and Rigorous Cor|rections. Stifle Mutinies in the Birth by &s;harp Executions, as the be&s;t means to make impre&s;&s;ions in Souldiers hearts, whom Rhetorique makes more in&s;olent. Soul|diers, as other men, have times of lea&s;ure and vacation from the Exerci&s;es of the Camp; therefore to prevent the en|trance
<PB N="84" REF="49">of Sloth and Idlene&s;s, 'tis the Generals part to invent &s;uch Diverti&s;ements as may by con&s;tant imployment &s;ecure them from tho&s;e Vices, and withal render Military En|gagements more familiar, and &s;o le&s;s formidable to them. The duty of a Souldier is to obey willingly, and execute readily the Commands of his Officer: And that of a Com|mander is to act with Cou|rage, Di&s;cretion, and Faith|fulne&s;s, to win them to a prompt obedience by Good Words, (as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> call'd them Fellow-Souldiers) and by care of their Per&s;ons, Rela|tions, Credit, and Intere&s;t, which will oblige them upon occa&s;ion to humble Acknow|ledgements
<PB N="85" REF="49">and real Grati|tude.</P>
<P>When you have thus &s;ettled the proportion and Di&s;cipline of your Army, you cannot rationally pre&s;ume of &s;ucce&s;s in your enterprizes, without good Rules and Orders for fight; which though they va|ry in this of War, as in other Arts, according to the diffe|rent circum&s;tances of Action; yet Maximes grounded on Rea&s;on and Experience will fit a man to u&s;e all occa&s;ions to be&s;t advantage: I have of|ten ob&s;erved a great di&s;order in the Modern Di&s;cipline, and had an earne&s;t de&s;ire to re|dre&s;s it, which will appear to you by my large Collection of Notes to that purpo&s;e;
<PB N="86" REF="50">but could never obtain lea|&s;ure from my Great Employ|ments to perfect my De&s;ign, which may de&s;erve the Pains of &s;o great a Prince as you to compleat: The di&s;order is, That our Battels and Squa|drons are mar&s;halled in a di|rect Line, every particular Man, and the Ranks in gene|ral &s;tanding directly behind one another; &s;o that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for the fir&s;t to retreat without di&s;turbance to the next Ranks: And thus the full &s;trength and effect of the Army, depends on the three or four fir&s;t Ranks of the Bat|tel. My de&s;ign was, to find out a method whereby the fir&s;t Rank being forced to re|tire might not bear upon the
<PB N="87" REF="50">&s;econd, nor the &s;econd upon the third; but that the hin|der Ranks might without di&s;|order or di&s;turbance readily &s;tep forward into the place of the wearied men, and at once relieve them and engage the Enemy; &s;o that no inconve|nience may befall the Army upon the Retreat of the fir&s;t Ranks; which I look as the chief Perfection of the Roman Di&s;cipline. To effect this, my project was, to divide the Vantguard-Battel and Rere|guard into three Squadrons, one to anothers &s;ide in a Tri|angular Form; the fir&s;t to re|pre&s;ent the point, the other two the &s;ides; for being thus di&s;-joyned and &s;evered by Art, it were ea&s;ie to bring
<PB N="88" REF="51">forward the &s;econd to fight, without di&s;turbing the fir&s;t; and the third, without di&s;or|dering the other two: Whereby, be&s;ides other Ad|vantages, the fortune of the Field will be thrice attempt|ed in one Encounter. And from this rough draught of the De&s;ign, you may proceed to an exact Method how the&s;e Squadrons being &s;ub-divided into &s;maller, may relieve one another with like Advantage, which Experience mu&s;t per|fect.</P>
<P>Another Errour in the Mo|dern Di&s;cipline, is, That the be&s;t Souldiers are put in the fir&s;t Ranks; whereby it comes to pa&s;s that if the&s;e begin to &s;hrink and give back, the re&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="51">by their example do the like, as if it were their Duty to imi|tate their Betters even in bad Actions; which hath been the Ruine not only of Companies and Regiments, but intire Armies: And herein the Ro|mans are worthy imitation, who placed in the Front tho&s;e they called <HI>Ha&s;tati,</HI> or Pike|men, con&s;i&s;ting of young men of greate&s;t &s;trength and courage, mixed with a third part of old Souldiers, to tem|per the heat, and direct the valour of the Youth; in the &s;econd Squadron, called <HI>Prin|cipes,</HI> were two parts of old experienced Souldiers, and a third of young: The third called <HI>Triarii,</HI> was intirely made up of the mo&s;t expert
<PB N="90" REF="52">and couragious in the Army. By this excellent Order it came to pa&s;s, that not only the fir&s;t on-&s;et of the Roman Ar|my being made by the warm Blood and emulous Courage of their choice&s;t Youth, was violent and impetuous, and their Defence vigorous a|gain&s;t the mo&s;t brisk A&s;&s;aults; but that if at any time they gave back or were repul&s;ed, the &s;econd Squadron was rea|dy to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock with greater Bravery; and upon their Retreat, the <HI>Triarii</HI> &s;uc|ceeded to maintain the fight, with a&s;&s;ured hopes of Victo|ry, to beat off tho&s;e Enemies who could not but be ex|treamly weakned by the Va|lour of the <HI>Ha&s;tati,</HI> and expert
<PB N="91" REF="52">Courage of the <HI>Principes.</HI> This Order I approve of, as of greate&s;t u&s;e. And though the high Reputation of the Ro|man Arms may by their great and long &s;ucce&s;s in War, ju&s;ti|fie the imitation of their Di&s;|cipline without further Rea|&s;on; yet 'tis obvious to eve|ry Eye on what &s;olid Grounds of Prudence this Order was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that of the Greek <HI>Phalanges</HI> mar&s;halled in direct Lines rejected by the Romans, who though they re|ceived the Rudiments of War from the Greeks, became greater Proficients in the Art than their Teachers; making them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the one and the other, by conquering <HI>Greece</HI> with tho&s;e Arms the
<PB N="92" REF="53">u&s;e whereof they derived from the Grecians. Another Argument for Collateral Squadrons, is, That the <HI>Pha|langes</HI> or Ranks mar&s;halled in a direct Line, are &s;ubject to greater Execution by the Enemies Artillery, which &s;cours all that &s;tands before it in a &s;trait Line. Be&s;ides many other Ob&s;ervations which you will find &s;cattered in my Notes for your dire|ction in this and other points of War.</P>
<P>Nothing can render your Name more Illu&s;trious than the Glory of perfecting this project for the better order|ing of Forces in Battel. But let not your Employments at Land, make you forget that
<PB N="93" REF="53">the Sea is part of your Domi|nion: Provide &s;tores of all nece&s;&s;ary Implements for Fleets; Let your Ve&s;&s;els be well rigg'd, mann'd, and em|ploy'd in the &s;ervice of the State, and augmented to that number that may be &s;ufficient to &s;erve your De&s;igns, with|out depending upon your Neighbours or Subjects. And never admit any Ve&s;&s;el into the Li&s;t of your Fleets, but &s;uch only wherein you have propriety: For private men are &s;o wedded to their parti|cular Intere&s;t, that upon the appearance of danger their &s;tudy is to pre&s;erve their Ve&s;|&s;els, though to the Ruine of the State.</P>
<P>Cau&s;e your Forts to be
<PB N="94" REF="54">often viewed, their works frequently &s;urveyed, and &s;ee them repaired and improved where requi&s;ite; and the Stores fill'd with all nece&s;&s;a|ries. Provide faithful, expert and couragious Governours, and tru&s;ty Souldiers: The Accidents of Death, Sickne&s;s, and lo&s;s of men, will prompt you to exceed in number, ra|ther than fall &s;hort; but make choice of &s;uch as may give you cau&s;e, with the Romans, to rely more on the Valour of your Souldiers, than the &s;trength of the place, though never &s;o well fortified by Art and Nature. Let your Forts on the Frontier be few but &s;trong. When you are a&s;&s;aul|ted, rather meet your Enemy
<PB N="95" REF="54">bravely in the Field, than coop your &s;elf up in a Garri|&s;on. When you are the Ag|gre&s;&s;or, choo&s;e to annoy the Enemy by Forts and Sconces rai&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; and not with intolerable expence of Moneys and Time, and lo&s;s of Men, to &s;it down before his places of &s;trength, which &s;el|dom recompence your pains in the taking. In erecting Forts take your Model from the na|ture of the place, and apply your Indu&s;try to make the whole proportionable to the parts, and the parts to the whole. And though no place can be impregnable, make yours of that &s;trength that may deprive the Enemy of hopes to take them without a
<PB N="96" REF="55">tedious &s;iege, great lo&s;s of men, va&s;t expence, and other di&s;advantages that attend tho&s;e difficult Enterprizes.</P>
<P>The Provi&s;ions of War are Victuals, Artillery, Ammuni|tion, Supplies, and Coyn; which are then &s;ufficient when the quantity &s;eems to maintain an Army in a capacity to per|form any Martial Attempt; which had my weighty Occa|&s;ions permitted, I had reduced to a certainty. My project was, to rai&s;e a Gallant Army compo&s;ed of <HI>Flemins, Ger|mans, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> to be kept in con&s;tant exerci&s;e again&s;t the Turk and Chri|&s;tian Princes whom Danger or Intere&s;t &s;hould oblige me to engage with. For their
<PB N="97" REF="55">Maintenance I de&s;ign'd to ca|pitulate with them, That all Booties belonging to the ad|ver&s;e State, as Artillery, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be intirely mine and my Succe&s;|&s;ors, and all private Spoils to be di&s;tributed among the Souldiers; yet &s;o, as to oblige them at rea&s;onable Rates to &s;ell to an Officer to be appoin|ted to that purpo&s;e; &s;uch Garments, Victuals, and other things of that nature, as were not nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;ent u&s;e, which &s;hould be &s;tored up by him, and &s;old again to the Souldier upon occa&s;ion with &s;ome profit to me. This had been of great conveniency to me, but more to the Souldier, in having at hand all Nece&s;&s;a|ries

<P>This done, my intention was, to con&s;titute an Officer to receive and &s;ecure &s;uch Moneys or Goods as the Soul|dier upon apprehen&s;ion of any dangerous Service, or other con&s;ideration, &s;hould depo&s;it with him; and to be an&s;wer|able for the &s;ame to the Soul|dier, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns with allowance of a rea&s;onable gain at &s;o much <HI>per cent.</HI> for the u&s;e, with Provi&s;ion that the goods of &s;uch as died without Heirs, &s;hould according to the cour&s;e
<PB N="99" REF="56">of the Civil Law, belong to the Chamber of the Prince, and the like Con&s;titution for &s;uch as departed inte&s;tate: and what Souldier in the Army, whether private or in Com|mi&s;&s;ion, would not prefer the &s;ecuring of his Goods, where he, his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns &s;hould certainly receive them, before the expo&s;ing them to the ha|zard of Lo&s;s by the Enemy, and other Accidents? And to defray the charge of Carriage requi&s;ite for &s;uch things, al|lowance &s;hould have been made by the Souldier out of the Gains to come to him from the U&s;e. This Cour&s;e will be of great Advantage to the Prince, who may make con&s;i|derable profit of the Moneys
<PB N="100" REF="57">remaining in the hands of his Officers on this Account, to &s;upply his Occa&s;ions for pay|ment of his Army, and other nece&s;&s;ary Charges, without injury to to the Proprietors: And be&s;ides this, it will &s;e|cure the dependance of the Army upon him, the things depo&s;ited being good Pledges of their Loyalty, and &s;erve as an inexhau&s;tible Mine of Trea&s;ure, by the Moneys and Goods of tho&s;e that die with|out heirs and Inte&s;tate, or forfeit them by Di&s;loyalty.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the recei|ved Opinion that Moneys are the Sinews of War, you may believe it on my Experience, that it conduces much to the &s;trength of an Army well ap|pointed
<PB N="101" REF="57">in all other things, but is far le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than good Di&s;cipline, Courage, Experience, and other Condi|tions requi&s;ite in well-order|ed Troops, and indeed of no efficacy in point of War where the&s;e are wanting. There|fore think your &s;elf more obliged to provide able Lea|ders, expert Souldiers, and good Orders for your Forces, than Moneys; the rea&s;on is, That &s;uch an Army under the Conduct of a valiant and pru|dent General, can never want means to maintain it &s;elf by Pillage and Victuals, to be gained even in the heart of their Enemies Countrey. And though Provi&s;ions may be &s;ometimes &s;cant, the bare Pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="102" REF="58">of Pay and Rewards from a Prince in Reputation with his Army for Power to perform, and for keeping his Word, will keep them in heart in the greate&s;t Difficulties. 'Tis true, the nature of War is &s;uch, whether offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, and the Charge &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that without &s;ome help 'twere impo&s;&s;ible for a Prince to bear it; but the Cour&s;es intimated before, and the Booty of rich Towns and Cities to be gained by Sieges or Stratagems, will render it tolerable and ea&s;ie: And it mu&s;t be your Care to make the War contribute to the mainte|nance of it &s;elf, by employing your Forces in Actions atten|tended with Profit as well as
<PB N="103" REF="58">Honour, and declining all u&s;ele&s;s and unprofitable En|terprizes.</P>
<P>Mortality and other Acci|dents common to Man, make it impo&s;&s;ible for an Army to &s;ub&s;i&s;t long intire in the &s;ame State without Supplies; in order to which, you are to cau&s;e frequent Mu&s;ters to be made in all Places of your Dominion, fit to yeild Supplies of men, and Regi|&s;ters to be kept of all the Youth able to bear Arms, where it may be done with|out apparent danger to the State by Tumult and In&s;urre|ction.

<PB N="106" REF="60">Hou&s;e, it will impair your Authority, encourage your Enemies, weaken your Pow|er, and cool the Affections of your ancient Friends.

<P>The Turk is your greate&s;t and mo&s;t certain Enemy, both on the Account of Religion, which you are to prefer be|fore all other Intere&s;ts; and that the violent Con&s;titution of his Tyrannical Government keeps him always on his Guard, to &s;ecure his Power again&s;t &s;udden Attempts; and &s;o his Forces are ever in readi|ne&s;s to be poured where hope of &s;ucce&s;s invites him, who de|&s;ires no other Cau&s;e of Quar|rel. When I con&s;ider the long cour&s;e of <HI>Danubius,</HI> and the great Champaign of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> the &s;ituation of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and Neighbourhood of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> with the Power of the Neighbours on the one &s;ide,
<PB N="114" REF="64">and the de&s;ert Condition of the Borders on the other, I am induced to believe that he will wave the pro&s;ecution of his Conque&s;ts there for the pre&s;ent, and bend his Forces again&s;t the I&s;lands, and your States in <HI>Italy,</HI> which he will a&s;&s;ault before he breaks with <HI>Venice;</HI> the rea&s;on is, That if he fall on the Venetian fir&s;t, he may expect greater Oppo|&s;ition by &s;uch Auxiliary For|ces as you may &s;end in their Aid; but need not fear the Venetians engagement again&s;t him in your Quarrel in a time of peace with them, as well for that all Republiques, whe|ther Ari&s;tocratical or Demo|cratical, flattering them&s;elves with hopes of a perpetual &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance,

<P>The Turki&s;h Empire hath its period, but known only to God; and 'tis in vain to ex|pect his Fall by Miracles from Heaven, which mu&s;t be effe|cted by &s;ound Policies and
<PB N="116" REF="65">&s;trength of Armed Men. The poor effects Experience hath &s;hewed of an Univer&s;al League and Combination of Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Turks, afford you this Rule, That while men manage the Affairs of the World, they will often &s;acrifice the be&s;t Cau&s;e and neare&s;t Concerns of true In|tere&s;t, to Humours and Pa&s;&s;i|ons; whereof you have a pregnant in&s;tance in the beha|viour of the French King on a cau&s;le&s;s Jealou&s;ie in the mat|ter in hand. This makes me conclude it a common Errour that the exce&s;&s;ive Power of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> is to be humbled rather by the United Forces of &s;everal Princes, who cannot but have &s;everal De&s;igns and
<PB N="117" REF="65">&s;everal Intere&s;ts, than by the &s;trength of one mighty Po|tentate, who&s;e De&s;igns are like his Per&s;on, &s;ingle and in|tire, and his Intere&s;t one and the &s;ame. This great Work &s;eems re&s;erved for you, as the greate&s;t Prince of the Chri|&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; and with the Aid of your Allies of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> of &s;uffici|ent Ability to encounter that Pagan Giant; but not with|out a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t proper means to at|tain your ends, by &s;uch ways as &s;ound experimental Wi&s;|dom &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t what War is mo&s;t available again&s;t him, Defen|&s;ive or Offen&s;ive, by Preven|tion or by Diver&s;ion? As for
<PB N="118" REF="66">Defen&s;ive War, nothing but pure Nece&s;&s;ity can ju&s;tifie the choice of it; being the mo&s;t unprofitable, uncomfortable, and dangerous, as that where|in we do but expo&s;e and lay our &s;elves open to the injuries of Ho&s;tility, to the manife&s;t con&s;umption of our &s;trength, and to the apparent danger of our whole Intere&s;t, without hope of Re&s;titution of Lo&s;s, or Reparation of Damages.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of ma|king the Preparations requi&s;it for an Offen&s;ive War, without the knowledge of the Turk, and finding him on his guard, may di&s;&s;wade you from that cour&s;e; as the multitude of Forces he maintains in con|&s;tant pay, and always in readi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="119" REF="66">anticipates all De&s;igns to mole&s;t him, by preventive Wars, or by way of Diver|&s;ion; &s;o that my Advice is, To avoid the &s;imple kinds of War, and to re&s;olve on a mixt, Defen&s;ive in appear|ance, but Offen&s;ive in act; which if wi&s;ely managed, may by degrees of Prevention and Diver&s;ion, be at length con|verted into a pure Offen&s;ive; which mu&s;t be effected more by &s;lights and &s;tratagems, than plain force, again&s;t this po|tent Enemy: And to his pur|po&s;e you will find frequent Opportunities by the Trou|bles and Encombrances of his other Wars, his Lo&s;&s;es, and the Di&s;orders of his Camp, and the Di&s;cord about the
<PB N="120" REF="67">&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Empire. But rely chiefly on the favour of God, which is partly pro|cured by the u&s;e of means ap|proved by humane Di&s;creti|on, as conducing mo&s;t to the ends we aim at; and there|fore you are to pre&s;erve the Affections of your Allies of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to your Per&s;on and Intere&s;t. And as the &s;tate of their Affairs can|not but oblige them to a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence and Amity with you for the better At|chievement of their Enter|prizes; &s;o you are to believe that to maintain Friend&s;hip and Good Intelligence with them, will not only &s;trengthen your Intere&s;t in general, but is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in
<PB N="121" REF="67">order to Succe&s;s again&s;t the Turk.</P>
<P>Accompt that your be&s;t time of war with the <HI>Otto|man,</HI> when he is engaged with &s;ome potent Enemy el&s;e where, or perplexed with dangers and &s;editions, di&s;contents or factions at home: But if the Conditi|on of your Affairs cannot conveniently allow the ex|pectation of the&s;e opportu|nities, when your preparati|ons have given him the Alarm, and drawn his for|ces into the field, make u&s;e of &s;hifts and delayes to fru|&s;trate his de&s;igns by declin|ing engagement, and putting upon him the lo&s;s of the
<PB N="122" REF="68">whole expence of that <HI>Cam|pagn:</HI> And the next year take the advantage of his &s;e|curity, want of preparati|on and di&s;ability to appear on the &s;udden in compleat equipage: And be &s;ure to march forward with all ex|pedition, that you may for|tifie your new Conque&s;ts, and be in a capacity to main|tain them again&s;t him by a re&s;olute defence before he advances to &s;top your cour&s;e: and di&s;po&s;e your af|fairs, &s;o that when he begins to di&s;band and draw off into his quarters, you may be ready to fall on: And by renewing the war, put him on the nece&s;&s;ity of continu|ing
<PB N="123" REF="68">his va&s;t Armies in pay, (which he can by no means endure long,) or reduce his Army to &s;o mean a pro|portion, as may give you a&s;|&s;ured hopes of victory.</P>
<P>No place is fitter for the &s;eat of the war, than in &s;ome parts of <HI>Hungary</HI> remote from <HI>Danubius;</HI> for be&s;ides the narrowne&s;s of &s;everal pa|&s;&s;ages extremely incommo|dious for the huge bodys of his Cavalry, He will be de|&s;titute of tho&s;e Convenien|cies which the River affords for that immence baggage, and cumber&s;ome train u&s;u|ally attending his Camp, whereof you may make ex|cellent u&s;e to the benefit of
<PB N="124" REF="69">your, and prejudice, if not ruine of his de&s;igns. And to that purpo&s;e, I again Commend to you a good Corre&s;pondence with your Uncle the King of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> to whom you are to Grant and offer all Aydes of men or mony to keep the ballance even, till you find an opportunity to appear in the field.</P>
<P>The Turk relies intirely on the number and &s;trength of his men: And your way to defeat him being by &s;tra|tagem; be carefull to draw him into &s;traight and narrow places, where he cannot for want of room make u&s;e of his whole power. And
<PB N="125" REF="69">may be pinched for defect of Carriages, and nece&s;&s;a|ry provi&s;ions. In Engage|ments and Conflicts, provide Stout Companies of Foot to annoy his hor&s;e; who being generally without Ar|mour, are &s;oon routed by the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of a Gallant infantry. 'Tis a point of the Turki&s;h di&s;ci|pline, to re&s;erve the Jani|zaries for the la&s;t on&s;et and recour&s;e to victory: And if a choice &s;equadron be pickt out to engage them, from the beginning to the end of the battle; the unexpect|edne&s;s of the &s;tratagem will &s;urprize, and much di&s;order the Janizaries, and abate

<P>To this end, it was my de&s;ign to build two or three forts between <HI>Turine</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> of that Art and &s;trength, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ght deter the <HI>French</HI> from attempting <HI>Italy</HI> that way, by the diffi|culty

<P>That King may be a&s;&s;ault|ed in his own Country two wayes, by taking &s;ome &s;trong places upon the fron|tiers, or by entring the heart of his Dominions with a compleat Army, and making your &s;elf Ma&s;ter of the field. But the &s;trength of his Towns and Ca&s;tles

<PB N="133" REF="73">come into the field: And that his Country abounds &s;o much with Victuals and other provi&s;ion, that an Ar|my cannot want in &s;o great plenty: And needs only u&s;e its power to maintain it &s;elf by the &s;poils of the enemy. You cannot expect by one A&s;&s;ault, to break the force of &s;o compact a Body as the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> but think that expedition well made, wherein you become Ma&s;ter of a Limb, and bring &s;ome &s;mall part to your obedience; if you make good your ground, and retain firmly what you gain by peicemeal, every &s;tep you make advances you fur|ther

When you have once got footing there, a thou&s;and opportunities from the di&s;traction of that &s;tate, by their divi&s;ions and ani|mocities in matter of Reli|gion, the ambition of the great ones, and other acci|dents, will pre&s;ent them|&s;elves for improvement of your intere&s;t. The Sun though he moves in&s;en&s;ibly, doth compa&s;s the world in 24 houres. And common &s;ence informs, you that the &s;malle&s;t particle taken from the le&s;&s;er quantity, and ad|ded to the greater, Auge|ments
<PB N="135" REF="74">the one, and dimi|ni&s;hes the other: which I mind you of, that you may not be di&s;couraged, though you cannot on the &s;udden overcome this King|dom; but per&s;evere in the pro&s;ecution of your de&s;ign upon this A&s;&s;urance, that by gaining the parts, you will at la&s;t Ma&s;ter the whole.</P>
<P>If the French Kings mo|tions give you cau&s;e to be|lieve, that by the advantage of the &s;ea&s;on, and forward|ne&s;s of the Country, he may enter <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ome moneths be|fore your Army can arrive in <HI>France;</HI> Make &s;hew of early, and great preparati|ons again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> to march
<PB N="136" REF="75">thither as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on of the year will permit: And by this &s;tratagem you will oblige him to u&s;e tho&s;e for|ces for defence at home, which he de&s;igned for for|reign Conque&s;ts: So jea|lous is he of that Kingdom; So contrary is it to the Maxims of his Policy, to leave his frontiers unguard|ed with an Army, when threatned with ho&s;tility from abroad, or to expo&s;e his Kingdom to an invation, in the ab&s;ence of any con&s;ide|rable part of his forces.</P>
<P>When you have re&s;olved on either of the&s;e cour&s;es of war with <HI>France,</HI> take heed of wavering from your
<PB N="137" REF="75">choice, as a thing mo&s;t di&s;tru|ctive to your affairs: and avoyd it as a Rock &s;hewed you by a Pilot, who&s;e &s;hip was &s;plit thereon. I entred <HI>France</HI> to|wards <HI>Landrecy,</HI> with full purpo&s;e to have advanced into the heart of the King|dom, before the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers</HI> ar|rived to their ayd, but the altering of this re&s;olution in my &s;tay, to winn &s;ome Towns on the frontiers (which detained me longer than I expected, being de|luded by the facility of re|ducing the fir&s;t I attaiqued,) gave the King time enough to provide &s;trength &s;ufficient to encounter me; and pro|ved &s;o fatal in the con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="138" REF="76">that I was con|&s;trained by plain force to re|tire, and yield to conditi|ons, which (to be free with you) &s;erved only for a Co|lour of retreat, without any advantage to my affairs.</P>
<P>Pur&s;ue your victories in <HI>France</HI> effectually, and with diligence: And having for|ced them to &s;eek Ayds from abroad, fall on them afre&s;h before the Auxilia|ries Arive: And when the &s;ucce&s;s an&s;wers not your ex|pectation, repair your for|ces, and hold them &s;o long in play, till the &s;ea&s;on of the year make them de&s;pair of any advantage to be made in <HI>Italy</HI> by your re|treat:
<PB N="139" REF="76">Rely not on the multi|tude, but choice of your men; and prefer a gallant, though &s;mall Army, before a nume|rous: and again&s;t <HI>France</HI> make &s;pecial povi&s;ion of &s;trong Companys of foot to encounter their hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I will reiterate my advice again&s;t &s;iting down with your forces before any place of &s;trength that may require a long &s;iege, unle&s;s invited by corre&s;pondence within, or &s;ome other particular advantage, that gives a&s;&s;ur|ed hopes of di&s;patch: and that not only for the rea|&s;ons given before, but that it is a matter of extream dif|ficulty, to maintain an Ar|my
<PB N="140" REF="77">long at a &s;iege, where convenient room is not made for the Convoys. My randezvous a <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> fru|&s;trated my de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Provence,</HI> and opened the eyes of the French King to &s;py his advantage, by diver|&s;ion in <HI>Turine;</HI> where he made war with &s;ecurity, forced me to retreat with great danger, gained credit with the States of <HI>Italy</HI> by the action, and had hazard|ed all the e&s;tates you hold there, had he known as well to u&s;e, as perform his under|takings.</P>
<P>The difficulty of recruit|ing your Armies in <HI>Italy</HI> by &s;upplies from <HI>Spain,</HI> when
<PB N="141" REF="77">requi&s;ite, upon any mi&s;adven|ture; and the propen&s;ity of tho&s;e States to Revolt from you, mu&s;t incline you by a&s;&s;aulting <HI>France,</HI> to pre|vent that King from ca&s;ting his thoughts to di&s;turb you in <HI>Italy;</HI> rather than to be on the di&s;advantage of an after gain, in ex|pelling him from thence: And a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, that States, and e&s;pecially the <HI>Italian,</HI> have no affection but for their intere&s;t, and will &s;tick to you, to their own prejudice or danger, but will be ready upon the lea&s;t appearance of your declining, to e&s;pou&s;e the quarrel of the pre|vailing
<PB N="142" REF="78">party, and fol|low the fortune of the Conqueror. Bend all your force to recover <HI>Sienna,</HI> that other States may by that ex|ample, perceive and fear the danger of &s;lighting your Authority, and intermed|ling with &s;trangers, to the prejudice of your af|fairs: And that you may by that means cut of the Corre&s;pondence between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Get perfect information of the affections, humours and intere&s;ts of the per|&s;ons in greate&s;t favour and credit with the French King, and the competi|tors for great offices, and
<PB N="143" REF="78">u&s;e the be&s;t means to gain the &s;tronge&s;t parties to your devotion; as the nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t excellent in&s;tru|ments to promote your de|&s;igns. In alliances and trea|ties, E&s;teem the removal of the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Pied|mont,</HI> above millions of Crowns in Dower, or the mo&s;t ample conditi|ons in a league: And indeavour earne&s;tly to in|duce them to a de&s;uetude from Arms, and a forget|fulne&s;s of military exer|ci&s;e. And when an op|portunity is offered to your advantage, lo&s;e it not: As to <HI>Piedmont</HI> I will repeat my advice for
<PB N="144" REF="79">recovery of it; and be|lieve it from my experi|ence, to be of more im|portance to your affairs, than if on the Flemi&s;h &s;ide you had bereaft the French King of a third part of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Your intere&s;t in <HI>Italy,</HI> is the main Artery by which the pul&s;e of all your power beats: And wherein lyes the greate&s;t mi&s;tery of your Policy: therefore mu&s;t your eyes be ever open that way, even to Jealou|&s;ie: To pre&s;erve it the better, U&s;e all devotion and kindne&s;s to the Pope and Apo&s;tlick See; Be cour|teous to all the Cardinals,
<PB N="145" REF="79">Bi&s;hops, Prelats and other members of the Court, and ever ready to defend them, and the Catholique profe&s;&s;ion. In the Electi|ons of Popes, when all the competitors are worthy of the dignity; Strive not to advance one before the other: And never u&s;e any means indirect, unlawfull or unchri&s;tian, to prefer your friends or creatures to the Chair; but look up|on it as a &s;acred action to be left as the election of <HI>Mathias</HI> in the tent, to the di&s;po&s;al of the Holy Gho&s;t. The expre&s;&s;ion of due re|&s;pects attended, with the con&s;ideration of your Do|minions
<PB N="146" REF="80">&s;ituate in the mid&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> and other means in your power, as King of &s;o many Countrys, and Patron of &s;o many great Eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, will infallibly procure you the friend&s;hip of the greate&s;t, and make the be&s;t among&s;t them dependants upon you, without lo&s;s or hinde|rance to Princes of your quality, though the Pope were elected by the votes of that party, who de|clared for another. But let me enjoyn you to pre|fer alwayes the univer&s;al good of Chri&s;tendom be|fore your private benefit, though the Examples of
<PB N="147" REF="80">others &s;eem to invert the Coun&s;el I give you. As the Dominions of the Church, are the center of <HI>Italy;</HI> So, if <HI>Sienna</HI> were recovered, they would be &s;urrounded with your Territories to the greater convenience for your de|&s;igns, and mo&s;t commodi|ous for an influence over the Court of <HI>Rome:</HI> If men of Piety &s;it in the Chair, they will in a religious ten|derne&s;s of promoting Chari|ty among Chri&s;tians, both court and de&s;ire your love: if the Popes be worldly minded, and &s;tudy more their plea&s;ures and intere&s;t, then the duties of their
<PB N="148" REF="81">office, (which God forbid) they will be glad to pre|&s;erve his friend&s;hip, whom they dare not di&s;plea&s;e. Stick not to powre the trea|&s;ure of your bounties on that Court, in obliging the Car|dinals, Bi&s;hops, and other Prelates, by dignities and preferments in your &s;everal Dominions; but e&s;pecially them who are mo&s;t intimate with the Pope, as mo&s;t u&s;e|ful in matters of grace and favour to be obtained from the Holy-Chair: though you are to rely mo&s;t on the Ju&s;tice and equity of your Demands, and the af|fection of his Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions of reli|gion
<PB N="149" REF="81">are &s;o deep in the hearts of men, that no|thing can prejudice your affairs more, than to leave in their minds an opinion of your being di&s;affected to the Mini&s;ters of God: there|fore if nece&s;&s;ity force you to break with the Pope, be &s;ure to clear your &s;elf from the imputation of the rupture, by making it appear, that the cau&s;e of unkindne&s;s proceed|ed not from you, but from the other &s;ide: And that the cour&s;e you take is not voluntary, but upon indi&s;pen&s;able obliga|tions of &s;ecurity and &s;elf pre&s;ervation. In matters re|lating
<PB N="150" REF="82">to a Generall Councel, conform your &s;elf to the determinations of the Ho|ly-Chair; and whatever happens, let the world &s;till perceive your Religion is unchangeable.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> you are &s;ure of Peace with them, while you think fit not to break the league; by rea&s;on of their fear|fullne&s;s to engage in war, though no a&s;&s;i&s;tance is to be expected from them for the rea&s;ons I have &s;hewed. And that jealou&s;ie, and apprehen&s;ions of ill from the increa&s;e of power, will have greater influence in their coun&s;ells, than any
<PB N="151" REF="82">other con&s;iderations. Their long neglect of military di&s;cipline, and di&s;u&s;e of Arms, their letting &s;lip &s;o many brave opportu|nities, the di&s;tractions of this age afforded them to Aggrandize their e|&s;tate, may invite you to a&s;&s;ault them; and their cu&s;tome of making ad|vantage of their weak neighbours mi&s;eries, may in a manner ju&s;tifie it. A &s;lothfull di&s;po&s;ition and moderate pro&s;perity, have inclined them to pre|&s;ume, their greatne&s;s may be maintained by ordi|nances of peace and &s;o|ber rules of the Long
<PB N="152" REF="83">robe. But if you &s;et upon them bri&s;kly, and pur&s;ue your fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion with Celerity to prevent their band|ing with other Princes; their un&s;kilfullne&s;s in war, the weakne&s;s of their &s;tate, and the con|fu&s;ions that will certain|ly attend their fear of your Arms, will give you opportunity to com|pa&s;s &s;ome great exploit before they awake out of &s;leep, or re&s;olve what to &s;pend, what friends to tru&s;t, what Leaders to employ, or re|&s;ume their old di&s;cipline for war. The conveni|ence
<PB N="153" REF="83">they have to at|taque you in <HI>Naples,</HI> and the inclinations of that people, to prefer their mild, and more civil Government, and kind u&s;age of the inhabitants, before yours; will oblige you to get the &s;tart of them by carrying the war to their doors, and pre|vent their attempts again&s;t your Dominions, by force|ing them to provide for defence of their own: Let it be your care to powre your forces into the center of their &s;tate as the way to make your &s;elf ma&s;ter of the field, it being impo&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="154" REF="84">them to put Garri&s;ons into their places of &s;trength, which they will fir&s;t &s;e|cure, and at the &s;ame time to keep the field: And in the mean while the defect of Garri&s;ons, Leaders provi&s;ions or for|tifications, the factions and particular di&s;contents of per&s;ons intere&s;&s;ed, will certainly afford you the occa&s;ion, to po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;elf of &s;ome of their places of &s;tength; which will be a good &s;tep to your further progre&s;s, e&s;peci|ally if by your Prince|ly and Gracious deport|ment, you encourage others to &s;ubmit to your
<PB N="155" REF="84">obedience, by granting the Burghers, Captains and Sol|diers rea&s;onable Articles, and &s;o good conditions, that they will have no ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain of the change of Ma&s;ters. When you are Ma&s;ter of the field, all places that are not &s;trong will pre&s;ently fall into your hands; which will force them into the field to en|deavour the &s;topping of your prevailing Arms by battail, wherein the greatne&s;s of your &s;trength, and expert &s;kill of your Soldiers, may give you a&s;|&s;ured hopes of victory over their new trayned
<PB N="156" REF="85">troops and raw Companies.</P>
<P>Let no pretence of friend|&s;hip, or profe&s;&s;ions of af|fection from any Prince of <HI>Italy,</HI> move you to per|mit him to aggrandize his &s;tate; but be per&s;waded by my advice, to keep them all within their due bounds, upon this infalli|ble Ground, that they are true only to their in|tere&s;t, and will no fur|ther adhere to you, then while it is for their turn, but will appear again&s;t you, upon any proba|ble hope to better their fortune. The divi&s;ions, and partialities of <HI>Italy,</HI> make it a matter of great
<PB N="157" REF="85">difficultie for you to pre|&s;erve in your obedience the States you enjoy there, their de&s;igns, and mo&s;t ardent de&s;ires, being bent to e&s;tabli&s;h a Duke at <HI>Mil|lain;</HI> and a King at <HI>Naples,</HI> which may hold of no &s;u|periour, but reign Sove|raign and Independant, as the means to weaken your encroaching power, and to free them&s;elves from for|raign &s;ervitude: And be|cau&s;e they may upon all occa&s;ions treat on even terms, with &s;uch petty Princes; and that the bonds of a common inte|re&s;t, which is the &s;ure&s;t obligation, would ingage
<PB N="158" REF="86">a King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and a Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> in a forreign league of Friend&s;hip with them, again&s;t forreign force, as involved in the like dan|ger, with other States of <HI>Italy,</HI> of being oppre&s;t from abroad; whereas the ine|quallity between them and you, is &s;uch that they neither dare engage in a war again&s;t you, for fear of lo&s;ing the re|mains of their liberty, and making their e&s;tates victims to your wrath; nor enter into a league, to add &s;trength to your pow|er, which they de&s;ire to &s;ee weakned, and increa&s;e your Authority, whereof
<PB N="159" REF="86">they are allready jealous. The Pope and <HI>Venetians</HI> are great promoters of the project I have told you; but the remedy is obvious to prevent their de&s;ignes: for if you maintain your reputation, by a con&s;tant Activity in Armes, hold good intelligence in every State; Imploy able Mini|&s;ters to the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> make u&s;e of the di|vi&s;ions and factions of tho&s;e Princes to your advantage, prevent combinations a|mong&s;t them, to your pre|judice; keep out the French King from <HI>Italy;</HI> and when the waters are troubled di&s;|creetly u&s;e the Golden|hook,
<PB N="160" REF="87">you may conclude your affairs &s;afe on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations mo&s;t dear Son I leave with you, as Rules for your conduct in Peace and War; And though the circum&s;tances of things may vary, yet the rea&s;on of my advice, re|maining the &s;ame, will be u&s;eful for direction in mo&s;t occurrences of State. And now by the duty and gra|titude you owe me your Father, your Prince and Benefactor, I charge you &s;trictly, and con&s;tantly to ob&s;erve with Reverence, the Laws of God and con|&s;cience, to regard them as the controll of your rea&s;o|nings,
<PB N="161" REF="87">and Rules of indi|&s;pen&s;able obligation in all your actions, that no de|&s;ign, no act, no &s;tratagem can be ju&s;t or worthy a Prince but what is con&s;onant to them: And amid&s;t the Ma|je&s;tick Glories of a mighty Prince, forget not your &s;elf to be a man, and that the prerogative of your Crowns exempts you from the ju|risdiction of tho&s;e tribu|nals, where bribery may corrupt, affections blind, ignorance mi&s;lead, fear over|awe, or impotence fru|&s;trate the judgement given, to re&s;erve your cau&s;e to the dreadfull examination and &s;entence of that Judge,
<PB N="162" REF="88">who is Ju&s;tice it &s;elf, and cannot be deceived; who for the &s;ins of Princes gives their dominions to whom he plea&s;es, without other re&s;pects to their Crowns, than to aggravate their offence in abu&s;ing the priviledges of their State, to the contempt of his Ju&s;tice and pre&s;uming to commit &s;uch trangre&s;&s;ions again&s;t his Laws, which they would not permit to be done by their Subjects again&s;t theirs. And remem|ber you are to account to a Judge, from whom there is no appeal, who inflicts heavie&s;t puni&s;hments on wicked Princes, as immedi|ate
<PB N="163" REF="88">offenders again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and therefore mo&s;t fit to be made examples of Ju&s;t Severity; as Good Kings are the immediate ob|jects of his care and provi|dence, partake mo&s;t of his bounty and favours, and are in affection no le&s;s then in dignity, nearer to God than other mortals.</P>
