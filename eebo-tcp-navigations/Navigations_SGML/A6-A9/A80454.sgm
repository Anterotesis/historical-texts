<HEAD><HI>THE COPIE</HI> OF A LETTER <HI>FROM</HI> A Commander in the <HI>FLEET</HI> with HIS HIGHNESSE the <HI>Prince of WALES. September</HI> the 7. 1648.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BE plea&s;ed to receive this narrative of the late&s;t Occurrents from the <HI>Fleet</HI> with His Highne&s;&s;e the <HI>Prince of</HI> WALES: His Highne&s;&s;e landed at <HI>Helford-&s;luce</HI> the la&s;t Saturday, and on Munday night was received according to His quality at the <HI>Hague:</HI> The cau&s;e of His return &s;o &s;oon from Sea, was a generall want of Victuals of all &s;orts in the <HI>Fleet.</HI> The Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> avoided two whole daies to <HI>fight</HI> with His Highne&s;&s;e; which had he had either wil or courage to do,
<PB N="2" REF="3"> he might have done it at plea&s;ure, the <HI>Prince</HI> having no means (the other being continually in the wind of Him) to avoid it; and the la&s;t of tho&s;e two daies the <HI>Prince</HI> got &s;o neer him, that both <HI>Fleets</HI> had been engaged, had not God in that in&s;tant of time, &s;ent &s;o &s;udden and vio|lent a &s;torme, as the like for the manner hath not been heard of, &s;o that both <HI>Fleets</HI> were forced to take in their <HI>&s;ailes,</HI> and come unto an <HI>Anchor:</HI> The Earle of <HI>War|wicke</HI> went afterwarwards into the entrance of the River of <HI>Chatham:</HI> His Highne&s;&s;e the next day advanced, but finding the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> had no mind to engage without a very great advantage, which was offered him among the <HI>Sands:</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> next morning being Fri|day, &s;et &s;aile, and with&punc; as little &s;ayle as po&s;&s;ible he could, &s;tood unto the Ea&s;tward, hoping to have drawne the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> from the <HI>Sands</HI> unto the open Sea: <HI>Warwicke</HI> being &s;wolne to above <HI>thirty Sayle,</HI> by rea&s;on of all outward-bound Ships came in to him, &s;et &s;ayle likewi&s;e; but he fir&s;t &s;aw the <HI>Prince</HI> &s;ome three Leagues at lea&s;t luward of him, the wind then at We&s;t. South|we&s;t, and South-we&s;t, he following with the &s;ame &s;ayle the Prince &s;till made, and when His Highne&s;&s;e le&s;&s;ened &s;ayle, he le&s;&s;ened, and when His Highne&s;&s;e lay by the lee, he did the like, keeping alwaies the &s;ame di&s;tance untill betwixt three or foure a Clock afternoon, and then fell from Him, and came unto an Anchor, 3 or 4 Leagues in the wind of the PRINCE's <HI>Fleet.</HI> Certainly <HI>Warwick</HI> had all the rea&s;on in the world to have engaged in Fight, con&s;idering all advantages were on his &s;ide, both of place and wind, and the prize for which he fought; whereas the <HI>Prince</HI> (all things well con&s;idered) had no rea&s;on at all, but His high courage drew Him thereunto, for when the Lords, the Officers, and whole company of the
<PB N="3" REF="3"> Ship, had humbly on their knees de&s;ired Him to betake Him&s;elf unto a place of &s;ome &s;ecurity for His Per&s;on, and enforced the &s;ame by many &s;trong rea&s;ons and per|&s;wa&s;ions: He onely replied, <HI>What doth this concerne mine Honour?</HI> and taking a &s;crued Gun in His hand, <HI>I am confident with this Piece this day to &s;hoot</HI> Warwicke <HI>through the head, if he dares in Per&s;on appeare in the Fight:</HI> and &s;o by His example, put a mo&s;t invincible courage into the hearts of all His People. The <HI>Prince</HI> had a fair opportunity to make Him&s;elf ma&s;ter of <HI>Port&s;|mouth Fleet,</HI> and that without blows; for His Highne&s;&s;e Ship made them before night, and knew them to be the &s;ame, and the tyde of ebbe being come, they could not turne it up, the wind We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, but were forced to come to an Anchor, His Highne&s;&s;e pa&s;&s;ed through them, onely giving notice to a catch to awaken one or two of them&punc; and command them to follow the Lord <HI>Warwicke,</HI> the <HI>Fleet</HI> being put to luward of them, and a &s;trong tyde of ebbe bent, it was not po&s;&s;ible again to re|cover them, but the reer Admirall came in up the &s;terne mo&s;t Ship: finding them (notwith&s;tanding their for|mer &s;ummons) a&s;leep, awakened them with two or three &s;hot. The <HI>Prince</HI> at His comming from the <HI>Downes,</HI> which was Saturday the 26 of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> had another de&s;igne then comming up the River, out of a hot de&s;ire the Sea-men had to fight with <HI>Warwicke,</HI> and I am con|fident, they would have &s;pent them&s;elves unto the la&s;t man again&s;t him, &s;uch was their violent earne&s;tne&s;&s;e to fight with him.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of force in Shipping, was I &s;uppo&s;e e|quall on both &s;ides, there being not four peeces of Ord|nance difference, the <HI>Prince</HI> had 17 Sayle, 11 onely bea|ring Ordnance, the re&s;t were Hoyes, Carches, and prize-Ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="4" REF="4"> unarmed. <HI>Warwicke</HI> at fir&s;t but 13. 11 whereof were wel-fitted, the other two Catches, but in courage and brave re&s;olution of people His Highne&s;&s;e far excee|ded him.</P>
<P>Surely never did an higher courage, and more gallan|try of re&s;olution appeare in man then, did in His Highne&s;&s;e, who&s;e great affability with His People, His readine&s;&s;e and clearne&s;&s;e of judgment, and His excee|ding confidence in all appearing difficulties, prove Him of a mo&s;t Martiall con&s;titution, and give us vi&s;ible, and infallible a&s;&s;urances, that with Gods ble&s;&s;ing, He will prove with a little experience one of the mo&s;t able Com|manders both by Sea and Land, now in Chri&s;tendome: and in Military prowe&s;&s;e will equall the mo&s;t warlike Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nces that ever this Nation bred.</P>
