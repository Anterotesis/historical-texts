<OPENER><SALUTE>Ingenuous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO thee alone I recom|mend the peru&s;al of this Journal, which not only my &s;elf, but &s;ome o|ther judicious Per&s;ons have thought worthy to appear in our Tongue, and among&s;t the <HI>Curio&s;o's</HI> of our Nation. The Author is well known to be a Man of Integrity, and one that &s;corns to impo&s;e upon the World an untruth; of which, <PB REF="3">in this occa&s;ion, nothing can tempt him to be guilty. If therefore &s;ome Particulars look with a &s;trange and un|probable Countenance, be not &s;o un&s;ociable in thy per|&s;wa&s;ion, as to reject what&s;oever thou ha&s;t no demon&s;tration to prove. A ridiculous Hu|mour, and a pernicious Rule, which tends to deprive us of the benefit of many Knowled|ges, both in Divine and Hu|mane Matters. It is unlikely that &s;uch a Per&s;on of di&s;creti|on and intere&s;t in the World, as he is known to be, &s;hould &s;o much forget his rea&s;on, as to <PB REF="3">&s;ub&s;cribe his Name to &s;uch fal|&s;hoods, as may be ea&s;ily di&s;|covered at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the place of his ordinary abode. I confe&s;s &s;ome Ob&s;ervations are trivial and ordinary, but o|thers will prove &s;atisfactory to &s;uch worthy Souls as de&s;ire to know the pa&s;&s;ages of the World, and Foreign Nati|ons. This Country of <HI>Egypt</HI> hath heretofore been the rich|e&s;t Magazin of Learning, as well as of Provi&s;ions: It hath flouri&s;hed in all Manual Arts, and the rare&s;t Sciences. No doubt but that there are yet to be &s;een &s;ome Monuments <PB REF="4">of the Primitive Grandeur and Learning of the ancient Inhabitants: As therefore
<HI>Van|&s;lebius</HI> hath judg'd them wor|thy to be vi&s;ited in his Travels, and afterwards of this account which he gives in Print, I think them not unworthy of thy knowledge; which thou maye&s;t perhaps improve in the interpretation of &s;ome ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages of holy Writ, and for other purpo&s;es according to thy Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF EGYPT: OR, A New Relation, or Journal, of the Tra|vels of Father <HI>Van&s;leb</HI> through <HI>Egypt.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="travel journal">
<P>IN the Year 1671. about the 8th of <HI>May,</HI> I was at
<HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> with an intention to &s;ail again into <HI>Egypt:</HI> for that purpo&s;e I found an opportunity, the Ship the <HI>Three Kings,</HI> Commanded by an Aged Captain named <HI>Artaut,</HI> was ready to depart for
<HI>Alexan|dretta.</HI> I went aboard, and &s;et &s;ail from the Port the 20th of the &s;ame Month, &s;trait towards <HI>Malta,</HI> where we remained five days, and after directed our Cour&s;e to <HI>Lernica,</HI> in the I&s;land of
<HI>Cyprus,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Merchants make their abode; on the Sea-&s;ide, looking towards the <HI>South,</HI> we arrived the 17th of
<HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I &s;et foot a&s;hore, I fell de&s;perately &s;ick of an ordinary Di&s;ea&s;e to all Strangers, proceeding from the Infection of the Air, that is an Enemy to them: But my Di&s;temper could not hinder me from going to <HI>Nico&s;ia,</HI> the chief City of the I&s;land. When I felt my Malady in|crea&s;ing every day, and the rather through the <PB N="2" REF="5">dangerous Infection of the Plague which was then in the I&s;land, I re&s;olved to be carried to <HI>Tripoli</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> the neare&s;t and mo&s;t conveni|ent Port where the <HI>French</HI> Nation hath a Con|&s;ul: While&s;t I was at <HI>Nico&s;ia,</HI> Captain <HI>Artaut</HI> was departed with his Ship for <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> and the 26th of <HI>June</HI> I went aboard another Ship in the Haven of <HI>Lernica,</HI> and the next day with a favourable Wind we landed at <HI>Tripoli.</HI></P>
<P>Though I had for&s;aken the infectious I&s;land, the di&s;ea&s;e of my body for&s;ook me not, but grew to that pa&s;s, that I prepar'd my &s;elf, as Chri&s;tia|nity injoyns us, to leave the World: Neverthe|le&s;s, at the end of 35 days, my di&s;temper being weary to torment me, &s;uffer'd me to recover a little &s;trength; and though I was but weak, I went aboard a Ship bound for <HI>Alepo</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>Septemb.</HI> arriv'd the 13th, and abode there four Months.</P>
<P>About the la&s;t of <HI>Decemb.</HI> I went to
<HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> where I remain'd a Month, and from thence to
<HI>Seyda,</HI> where I was al&s;o two Months.</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e is not to give any account of the Curio&s;ities of
<HI>Lernica,</HI> of <HI>Nico&s;ia,</HI> of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> of
<HI>Alepo,</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and of <HI>Seyda.</HI> The&s;e Towns are &s;ufficiently known to all the World, by the many Relations already publi&s;hed of the <HI>Levant</HI> Countries: Be&s;ides the &s;hortne&s;s of the time of my abode there, together with the inconvenien|cy of a Quartan Feaver which kept me compa|ny &s;ixteen Months, &s;uffered me not to inquire in|to any &s;uch matters. I &s;hall therefore in this Treati&s;e give an account only of what Curio&s;i|ties I have &s;een in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where during the &s;pace of twenty Months I have had the lei&s;ure and opportunities to take a view of the mo&s;t re|markable <PB N="3" REF="5">things, with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s and care imaginable, which hath never been done of this famous and beautiful Country till now.</P>
<P>The 19th day of <HI>February,</HI> 1672. I took Ship at
<HI>Seyda,</HI> a Town of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> to &s;ail for <HI>Da|mietta</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> but a contrary Wind ro&s;e, and brought us back to
<HI>Seyda</HI> again, where we re|main'd till the 16th of <HI>March.</HI> I went then a|board, and met with a favourable Gale, that drove us very happily to <HI>Bogas,</HI> which lies at the Mouth of the River <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>I think it convenient, before we proceed, to give a general account and de&s;cription of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that the things that I &s;hall hereafter mention may better be under&s;tood.</P>

<HEAD>A General De&s;cription of <HI>Egypt.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>CHam,</HI> one of the three Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> had four Children Males, <HI>Cus, Mi&s;raim,</HI> named by the <HI>Arabs Beidar, Fut,</HI> and <HI>Canaan. Cus</HI> was the Father of the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins, Mi&s;raim</HI> of the <HI>Cop|ties</HI> and <HI>Nubians, Fut</HI> of the
<HI>Africans,</HI> and <HI>Ca|naan</HI> of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and their Neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;raim</HI> after the Deluge, as <HI>Macri&s;i</HI> an
<HI>Ara|bian</HI> Hi&s;torian &s;aith, pitcht upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> made there his abode, and left it and the Country, as far as the farthe&s;t part of
<HI>Africa,</HI> to his Po&s;teri|ty. He had likewi&s;e four Sons,
<HI>I&s;chemun, Atrib, S&aacute;,</HI> and <HI>Coptus,</HI> unto whom he divided the Land of <HI>Egypt</HI> in four equal parts; <HI>Coptus</HI> had all that tract of Land, from <HI>I&s;van</HI> to the City of <HI>Coptus;</HI> to
<HI>I&s;chemun</HI> he allotted the Country from that City to <HI>Menuf;</HI> to <HI>Atrib</HI> he gave the Heart and <PB N="4" REF="6">middle of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> now called <HI>Delta;</HI> and to <HI>S&aacute;</HI> he appointed all the Continent, from the Pro|vince of <HI>Beheire</HI> as far as
<HI>Barbary.</HI> They all builded Cities in their &s;everal Dominions, call|ing them by their own Names. We &s;hall mention them in the &s;equel of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After the decea&s;e of their Father, the four Brothers were at variance about the Soveraign|ty, neither of them could endure a Partner. At la&s;t they re&s;olved to end their Controver&s;ies by a Battle, which was to give the chief Com|mand to the Victor.</P>
<P><HI>Coptus</HI> the younge&s;t overcame all the re&s;t of his Brethren, and was acknowledg'd by them as their Chief Lord. He cho&s;e the City of <HI>Me|nuf,</HI> or <HI>Memphis,</HI> where his Father lived, as his Royal Seat. From this King <HI>Coptus</HI> all the Race of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> are now called <HI>Copties.</HI> Likewi&s;e from this fir&s;t King, the
<HI>Greeks</HI> have given the name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> to the Land of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> by chan|ging the K into G; which is the cu&s;tom not on|ly of this Language, but al&s;o of the <HI>Arabian,</HI> as may appear by the words
<HI>Nekkade,</HI> and <HI>Dunkala,</HI> written in <HI>Arabian</HI> with a K, and neverthele&s;s they are pronounced in di&s;cour&s;e <HI>Neggade,</HI> and
<HI>Dungala,</HI> as if they were written with a G. They are the names of two Towns; the one in the Upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the other in
<HI>Nubia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Copties,</HI> Natural Inhabitants of the Country, call it <HI>Ma&s;&s;r,</HI> from <HI>Mi&s;raim</HI> the Son of
<HI>Cham,</HI> and the Grand-child of <HI>Noah,</HI> who fir&s;t laid the Foundations of it after the Deluge. And from the &s;ame <HI>Mi&s;raim,</HI> the
<HI>Turks</HI> have na|med it <HI>Mi&s;&s;ir,</HI> and the <HI>Jews Eretz Mi&s;raim,</HI> the Country of <HI>Mi&s;raim.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> is &s;cituate in <HI>Africa,</HI> according to the common and ordinary Opinion; neverthele&s;s, &s;ome of the Ancient Geographers have placed it part in <HI>Africa,</HI> and part in
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> making the Ri|ver <HI>Nilus</HI> as the Bounds between the&s;e two great parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> is bounded on the <HI>South</HI> with
<HI>Nubia,</HI> and the la&s;t City of <HI>Egypt</HI> is <HI>I&s;van,</HI> called by the <HI>Euro|peans Siene,</HI> which is commanded by the Bay of
<HI>Girge;</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> it hath the Provinces of <HI>Vah,</HI> and <HI>Barca;</HI> and on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> are the <HI>De&s;arts</HI> that divide it from <HI>Pale&s;tina;</HI> and on the <HI>North</HI> is part of the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>It &s;tretcheth it &s;elf in length from the City of
<HI>I&s;van</HI> to the Mouth of the River <HI>Nilus;</HI> at
<HI>Ro|&s;etta,</HI> in a &s;treight line, that is from <HI>South</HI> to
<HI>North</HI> about five hundred and three&s;core miles: it is not po&s;&s;ible to declare it preci&s;ely, becau&s;e they are not wont to mea&s;ure the Country by Miles, or by Leagues, but by the Camels Journeys only. I &s;ay here nothing, but according to the Relation of the Authors that have examin'd it.</P>
<P>It is divided, according to the accounts of the <HI>Divan,</HI> or Trea&s;ury, into three parts: 1. Into <HI>Said,</HI> or the Upper
<HI>Egypt,</HI> which begins at <HI>Sint,</HI> and extends as far as
<HI>I&s;van.</HI> 2. Into <HI>Vo&s;tani,</HI> or the middle <HI>Egypt,</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Said</HI> and <HI>Cairo:</HI> And 3. Into <HI>Bahri,</HI> or Inferiour <HI>Egypt.</HI> The mid|dle begins at <HI>Gize,</HI> a Village over again&s;t <HI>Bou|lac,</HI> and reaches as far as <HI>Momfallon&punc;</HI> and the lower commenceth at <HI>Cairo,</HI> and includes <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> and <HI>Damietta.</HI></P>
<P>The Upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> or that part of it which is habitable and u&s;eful, is very narrow. In the wi|de&s;t part, a Hor&s;e in four hours may pa&s;s over it; <PB N="6" REF="7">in &s;ome places it is not above three hours riding: and the Country in both &s;ides is wild, &s;andy, and hilly.</P>
<P>I cannot give an exact account of its wide|ne&s;s in the middle, but yet I am per&s;waded it is not much larger nor wider than the higher part; for being &s;cituated between both, <HI>Egypt</HI> begins to grow wider about
<HI>Cairo;</HI> it mu&s;t needs fol|low, that the middle is not much wider than the upper part, unle&s;s it be about the <HI>Ca&s;cieflik</HI> of
<HI>Fi&uacute;m,</HI> where <HI>Egypt</HI> in the middle begins to be wider; but yet I cannot give any exact account of it.</P>
<P>The Inferiour part is wider: The Inhabitants reckon about 70 miles from <HI>Damietta</HI> to <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> the mo&s;t We&s;tern-Town upon the Sea-Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>A Learned Per&s;on of this Age, in a di&s;cour&s;e concerning the cau&s;es of the Inundation of <HI>Ni|lus,</HI> hath very well proved again&s;t the Ancient Philo&s;ophers, that the lower <HI>Egypt</HI> hath always been, and is not a new gift of <HI>Nilus.</HI> He grounds his Opinion fir&s;t upon <HI>Homerus,</HI> who mentions the old City of <HI>Canopus,</HI> which was at one of the chief entrances into <HI>Nilus</HI> from the Sea. Se|condly, upon the te&s;timony of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>David, P&s;.</HI> 77. who have mentioned the City of <HI>Tanis,</HI> where was <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Court, and where God per|formed great Wonders.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> was always governed by Kings, but the Royal Seats have not always continued the &s;ame, for the Conquerours have altered them accord|ing to their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Royal City, as <HI>Macri&s;i</HI> &s;aith, was
<HI>Am|&s;us;</HI> but the Waters of the Deluge having rui|ned
<PB N="7" REF="7">it, the Po&s;terity of <HI>Noah</HI> built <HI>Menuf,</HI> or
<HI>Memphis,</HI> which was the Seat of the Ancient Kings of the Race of
<HI>Coptus,</HI> till <HI>Nabuchodonozor</HI> had &s;ack'd it. When
<HI>Alexander the Great</HI> had built <HI>Alexandria,</HI> he made it the Principal City, where all the &s;ucceeding Kings of the <HI>Greeks</HI> made their Re&s;idence for nine hundred years, till the <HI>Arabians</HI> had taken
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and made <HI>Fo|&s;tat</HI> Metropolis. But when
<HI>Giauher,</HI> the General of <HI>Meez le Din-alla</HI> had built
<HI>Cairo,</HI> about the year of the <HI>Hegeira</HI> 362. he called it
<HI>Dar il Memleke,</HI> that is the Royal Seat, which it hath been ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> hath been govern'd by three &s;everal &s;orts of
<HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes, &s;ince the <HI>Arabians</HI> took it from the
<HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t were named <HI>Omara Ma&s;&s;r,</HI> or Lords of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> without any other Title. They were all <HI>Arabians,</HI> and Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Amru ibn il A&s;s,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Conquerour, and after to <HI>Abu il Fevares,</HI> the la&s;t of that Race. We reckon one hundred and twelve Princes of <HI>Egypt,</HI> during the &s;pace of 337 Years, &s;even Months, and twenty Days. Their Conque&s;t happen'd about twenty years after the <HI>Hegeira,</HI> and ended in the year 358. They all dwelt at
<HI>Fo&s;tat Ma&s;&s;er,</HI> or there|abouts.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Race of the <HI>Arabians</HI> were called
<HI>Caliphs.</HI> They began to take that Title, when Ge|neral
<HI>Abuha&s;&s;ein Giauher</HI> had built <HI>Cairo</HI> by the Order of
<HI>Meez le Din-alba,</HI> who was then Prince of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and Conquer'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> and took it from the <HI>Arabians. Egypt</HI> was afterwards go|vern'd by its <HI>Caliphs</HI> about 108 Years, 4 Months, and 22 Days; that is, to the death of <HI>Adet le <PB N="8" REF="8">Din-alla,</HI> who was the la&s;t and Eleventh <HI>Caliph.</HI></P>
<P>The third &s;ort, named <HI>Sultans</HI> or <HI>Soldans,</HI> &s;uc|ceeded immediately after; of them there have been of four Nations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, who was the Po&s;terity of a certain
<HI>Eijub,</HI> were called <HI>Sultans Curdes.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd came from beyond the Seas, &amp; were named
<HI>Mamaluk Turks,</HI> becau&s;e they had been before Slaves, and &s;old by the Merchants of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> to the Kings of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who cau&s;ed them to be brought up and in&s;tructed in all Martial Di&s;cipline. When the King was dead, one of the&s;e Slaves was cho&s;en to &s;ucceed in the Throne.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort were &s;tiled <HI>Mamaluks Circa&s;&s;i|ans,</HI> becau&s;e they came originally from
<HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> and were brought thither by the Merchants as the former, and &s;old al&s;o as Slaves to the Kings of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who cau&s;ed them to be al&s;o train'd up as the former, unto whom they &s;ucceeded in the Regal Dignity and Command.</P>
<P>The fourth &s;ort, who are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, are the
<HI>Sultans</HI> of the Race of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> who over|came the
<HI>Circa&s;&s;ian Sultans</HI> in the year 922. of the <HI>Hegeira;</HI> for
<HI>Sultan Selim</HI> Conquer'd this King|dom in the year 1517.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> is inhabited at pre&s;ent by <HI>Copties, Moors, Arabians, Turks, Greeks, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Franks,</HI> and other &s;trange Nations; but as they are not nu|merous, they de&s;erve not to be mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> or <HI>Copts</HI> are the Natural Inhabitants of the Country, thus called, as we have already &s;aid, of
<HI>Coptus</HI> the Son of <HI>Mi&s;raim,</HI> who was King of <HI>Egypt</HI> after his Father.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors,</HI> who are named by the <HI>Arabians Aulad il Arab,</HI> or Children of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> are <PB N="9" REF="8">likewi&s;e as well as the <HI>Copties</HI> de&s;cended from the &s;ame Father, but they are become <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and it may be &s;ince they have Conquered <HI>Egypt,</HI> there are &s;ome among&s;t them yet that are come from the <HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> are a people of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and though they live in <HI>Egypt,</HI> they have no commu|nication with the
<HI>Moors,</HI> who are originally of the Country. They are of many differing Ge|nerations, govern'd by their &s;everal Chieftains, whom I &s;hall mention in the &s;equel of this di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves there &s;ince <HI>Sultan Selimus</HI> conquer'd <HI>Egypt.</HI> The&s;e go|vern the Country, defend it, and act in all Offi|ces of State.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> that live there now, and that make yet profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, have been invited thither by the great Trade of <HI>E|gypt;</HI> for there is no &s;ign of the Ancient
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves there when <HI>Alexan|der the Great</HI> conquer'd <HI>Egypt;</HI> if there be any, they are mingled with the
<HI>Copties,</HI> and are called by their names.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the <HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Emperours that fol|lowed the Council of <HI>Chalcedonia</HI> were glad to incourage a Party in
<HI>Egypt</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Copties,</HI> &s;worn Enemies of that Council, they protected there the <HI>Greeks</HI> that went thither from
<HI>Greece,</HI> that &s;ubmitted to that Council, and gave them means to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in this Kingdom; &s;ince that time the
<HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Religion hath been there profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> have always lived there; at pre&s;ent they are very numerous, and are in great repute, <PB N="10" REF="9">chiefly at
<HI>Cairo,</HI> and in the Maritime Towns: but unle&s;s it be in &s;uch places there are none to be found, for if their occa&s;ions call them into the Country, they u&s;ually di&s;gui&s;e and hide them|&s;elves; for when the Country-people find them out, they abu&s;e and affront them &s;trangely.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> at pre&s;ent in <HI>Egypt</HI> are not nume|rous, in compari&s;on of what they have been heretofore; for in the days of <HI>Amru ibn il A&s;&s;,</HI> who took this Country from the
<HI>Greeks,</HI> there was of this Nation &s;ix hundred thou&s;and that paid him Tribute: but now, according to the re|lation of their own Patriarch, there is &s;carce ten or fifteen thou&s;and. One of the Cau&s;es of this decrea&s;e, was their con&s;tancy in the Chri|&s;tian Religion, in the time of the
<HI>Romans;</HI> their Governours were &s;o furious again&s;t them for that rea&s;on, that they have put to death milli|ons at a time: for the Hi&s;tories tell us of the Governour under <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> the Emperour, who ma&s;&s;acred in one night, at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> four&s;core thou&s;and; who are buried upon Mount <HI>Achmim</HI> in the Upper <HI>Egypt.</HI> And at another time near <HI>I&s;na,</HI> either the &s;ame Governour, or another, put to death &s;o many that they were not to be num|bred, for they covered four&s;core <HI>Fiddans,</HI> or Furlongs, with their dead martyr'd bodies: The

<P>Another Cau&s;e of their decrea&s;e in the days of the Chri&s;tian Emperours, was their ob&s;tinacy in maintaining the Errour of
<HI>Dio&s;corus,</HI> one of their Patriarchs, concerning one Nature, one Will, and Per&s;on in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which cau&s;ed them to &s;uffer almo&s;t the &s;ame de&s;tructions as <PB N="11" REF="9">they had done formerly under the Heathen Em|perours for the Chri&s;tian Faith: For when the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours offered to force them to leave the Errour of <HI>Dio&s;corus,</HI> and to embrace the Faith e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Council of <HI>Chalcedone,</HI> and when they found them di&s;obedient and in|flexible; they made u&s;e of the Sword to compa&s;s their de&s;ign. Among&s;t the re&s;t the Emperour
<HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> as <HI>Macriz</HI> &s;aith in his Hi&s;tory of the Patriarchs, cau&s;ed two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Copties</HI> to be killed at
<HI>Alexandria</HI> for that very purpo&s;e. I &s;hall not mention the Cruelties of the other Emperours his Succe&s;&s;ors exerci&s;ed upon them. So that &s;uch as &s;urvived after &s;uch like Ma&s;&s;acres, when they &s;aw the danger that attended the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of this Opinion, and of appearing in the Cities, they retreated into the wilderne&s;s, or withdrew them&s;elves into the Mona&s;teries, in de|&s;pair, to lead a Mona&s;tical life, without marri|age, or thinking to propagate their Nation.</P>
<P>After this, the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Kings and Princes, that have governed <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Em|perours, when they found them rebellious a|gain&s;t their Government, have not &s;pared them. They have killed the Chief, &s;old for Slaves the Wives and Children of others, &s;o that the wea|ker &s;ort have been forc'd to turn <HI>Mahometans.</HI> By this means, after &s;o many evils, this Nation is reduced to a very &s;mall number.</P>
<P>They were anciently Heathens, every City had a God to adore.</P>
<P><HI>Abu&s;ir,</HI> or the old <HI>Bu&s;iris,</HI> wor&s;hipped a Calf. <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the ancient <HI>Racotis,</HI> adored

<PB N="12" REF="10">or the old <HI>Buba&s;tis,</HI> had for God a Lion of Stone. <HI>Eida</HI> adored <HI>Serapis.

<P>But &s;ince the coming of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they have been &s;ome of the fir&s;t that have embraced the Chri&s;tian Religion, at the preach|ing of the Apo&s;tle S. <HI>Mark.</HI> They have conti|nued in the right Faith, till <HI>Dio&s;corus</HI> their Patri|arch fell into this Here&s;ie, That in Je&s;us Chri&s;t there was but one Nature, one Sub&s;tance, one Will, and one Operation. This Errour with its Author was condemned in the Council of <HI>Chal|cedone,</HI> and &s;uch as receive it are counted as He|reticks by the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> therefore they have been per&s;ecuted by the Chri&s;tian Emperours in times pa&s;t.</P>

<P>The Chief City heretofore was <HI>H&uacute;,</HI> whereof I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter more at large; but now the Capital City is
<HI>Girge,</HI> where lives the <HI>Sangiac-Bey</HI> that governs it.</P>
<P>Anciently certain Princes ruled here in the time of the

<HI>Girg&eacute;,</HI> which hath been always the Chief City &s;ince that time till now.</P>
<P>About fifty years ago the <HI>Turks</HI> drove away from thence tho&s;e <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, and in their &s;tead they put the

<P>This puts me in mind of a mi&s;take of <HI>James Albertus</HI> in his di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Egypt;</HI> he &s;aith, that <HI>Said</HI> was about 60 years ago a Kingdom of it &s;elf, to which the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> did u&s;ually a&s;|&s;ign a <HI>Pacha.</HI> This Errour hath no ground: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e in all the Hi&s;tories, ancient and new, of the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> the Province of <HI>Said</HI> is never nam'd
<HI>Memleke</HI> a Kingdom, nor <HI>Pachalick</HI> the Government of a
<HI>Pacha,</HI> but only <HI>Arde Said, i. e.</HI> the Country of
<HI>Said;</HI> and its Rulers, were not nam'd Kings, or <HI>Pachas,</HI> but only <HI>Omara Said,</HI> or Princes of <HI>Said.</HI> Secondly, becau&s;e all the Governours of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Race, who have go|vern'd it &s;ince the driving out of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, are never call'd in the Regi&s;ters of the <HI>Divan,</HI> nor of the common people, otherwi&s;e than

<P>It is certain, the Province of <HI>Said</HI> is very large; and if it were all inhabited, and all ma|nur'd, as is the lower <HI>Egypt,</HI> its
<HI>Bey</HI> might con|tend with the <HI>Pacha</HI> of <HI>Cairo</HI> for pre-eminence. They have often endeavour'd to free them&s;elves from his Command, but becau&s;e the inhabited Country is very narrow, and the Villages and Towns ruinated, they could never &s;ucceed in their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the Government is much like that of the
<HI>Pachas</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> for he hath the &s;ame Officers to attend him, a <HI>Chiaoux-Bachi,</HI> or a Captain of the <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> an Interpreter, an <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and other

<P>The mo&s;t temperate Sea&s;on hath &s;omething of the

<P>The cold &s;ea&s;on, which is an&s;werable to our
<HI>Winter,</HI> begins about the middle of <HI>December:</HI> It is a delightful time, unle&s;s in the &s;even days which the Arabians call <HI>Berd il agiuz,</HI> or the cold of the old Hag; they begin about the 7th of
<HI>February,</HI> and continue till the 14th; the Mornings are then very cold, the Sky is cloudy, the Rains fall, and the Winds are commonly ve|ry boi&s;terous.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Winter</HI> is there very mild, per&s;ons of E&s;tate wear Furr'd Gowns, from the Month of <HI>November,</HI> till the Month of <HI>March,</HI> not be|cau&s;e of any great cold, for there is &s;carce any, but becau&s;e then the Weather is variable, and they fear to be incommoded with the di&s;tempers which this changeable weather produceth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Summer</HI> is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t trouble&s;om &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive heats of the hot Winds, and the dangerous di&s;ea&s;es that are rife, chiefly at that time, which the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> call <HI>Cam|&s;ins,</HI> which we name <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> This dangerous &s;ea|&s;on begins about the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-Monday of the
<HI>Copties,</HI> and ends at their <HI>Whit&s;on</HI>-Monday. About this time the Winds, called by the <HI>Arabians Meri&s;&s;i,</HI> are boi&s;terous; they are &s;o hot and trouble&s;ome, that they are ready to &s;tifle the breath, and they rai&s;e in the Air &s;o much Straw and Sand, that the Sky is darkned. This Sand is &s;o &s;ubtil, that it penetrates through every little chink and hole.</P>

<P>About this time Malignant Fevers commonly reign, Dy&s;enteries, and many other Di&s;ea&s;es; the lea&s;t is incurable, if the nece&s;&s;ary Remedies be not applied in time: And when the&s;e winds blow, the bodies that are not di&s;temper'd, are ca&s;t down, and not well.</P>
<P>The&s;e Southerly winds blow not every day in this &s;ea&s;on, nor every year in the &s;ame manner and fury; for in the year 1672. they blew but twelve times, and the next year but twice, and that very moderately; other fre&s;her and whole|&s;omer winds blew the re&s;t of the time. It is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the joy of the people, when the&s;e Southerly winds favour them, and are mild.</P>
<P>The ordinary time of Rains and Winds, which might be compared with our <HI>Autumn,</HI> be|gins in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> and continues till <HI>January,</HI> and <HI>February;</HI> though at
<HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Rains fall at other times, becau&s;e of the Seas that are &s;o near. At the Eve of the
<HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> in the year 1672. the wea|ther was full of Rain at
<HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> and the next day followed a very thick Mi&s;t. On the 24th day of <HI>November,</HI> in the &s;ame year, the Rains fell ve|ry moderately at <HI>Cairo;</HI> the Sky was ob&s;cure, and full of wind; and on the tenth, eleventh, fourteenth and fifteenth in the &s;ame Month, ve|ry furious Rains fell. By this you may &s;ee, that it is a great errour to &s;ay, that it never Rains in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>I have often &s;een in my Travels, that the weather hath been &s;o mi&s;ty and moi&s;t, that my Beard and Cloaths have been &s;o wet, that a &s;howre of Rain could not have wetted them more; and that which is wonderful is, that this <PB N="24" REF="16">happened in a &s;ea&s;on that none ever expected it. During &s;everal mornings in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> in the year 1672. in my travelling from <HI>Damiet|ta</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> the &s;ame thing happen'd to me in the Month of <HI>June</HI> at
<HI>Ro&s;etta;</HI> and in the Month of <HI>September</HI> at
<HI>Bene&s;uef;</HI> and in <HI>October,</HI> in my return from the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Anthony.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e wet Mi&s;ts are more frequent about <HI>Cai|ro,</HI> than in other places. They begin u&s;ually a|bout the Month of
<HI>November,</HI> before the ri&s;ing of the Sun, and continue all the
<HI>Winter.</HI> Some happen in other &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and many times in <HI>Summer,</HI> as I have taken notice in the year 1672. in the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in my re|turn back from <HI>Fium</HI> to
<HI>Mocanan,</HI> a Village about four hours travelling from <HI>Cairo,</HI> I &s;aw upon the Town &s;o thick a Mi&s;t, that I could not di&s;|cover it, nor the <HI>Pyramids</HI> that are near, though the Air was clear where I &s;tood.</P>
<P>In all the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, when the nights are &s;erene, there is &s;o much Dew that falls, that it may very well be taken for a little &s;howre; but when the Sky is cloudy, there falls no Dew. Were it not for the&s;e Dews, there would be no Gra&s;s nor Corn, the Trees would bear no Fruit, the wild Bea&s;ts in the De&s;arts could not live where there are no Fountains nor Rivers, and where the Rains fall but &s;eldom. Thunders are not often heard; in all the time that I was in <HI>E|gypt,</HI> I heard this noi&s;e but twice, on the fir&s;t day of <HI>January,</HI> and on the fourth of
<HI>May,</HI> 1673.</P>
<P>I have already &s;poken of the two chief Winds that blow in
<HI>Egypt, Meri&s;&s;i</HI> and <HI>Maltem.</HI> I mu&s;t further take notice, that not only the <HI>Southern</HI> Winds are named <HI>Meri&s;&s;i,</HI> but al&s;o the Ea&s;tern. <PB N="25" REF="16">They blow commonly twice every year; at <HI>Ea|&s;ter,</HI> called (as I have already &s;aid) <HI>Cam&s;in;</HI> and from the Month of <HI>November,</HI> till the middle of <HI>February.</HI> They are helpful to tho&s;e that tra|vel down the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> and to the Ships that &s;ail from the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> through the Red-Sea to <HI>Sues:</HI> But they are contrary to tho&s;e that go up the River: From hence it &s;ometimes hap|pens, that Travellers are 30 days going up from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Girge,</HI> which Voyage is ea&s;ily perform|ed in 8 or 10 days when the other winds blow.</P>
<P>The Winds called <HI>Maltem</HI> or <HI>Teij&aacute;b</HI> are We&s;t|erly Winds: They begin about twelve days be|fore the Rain falls, and la&s;t till the Month of <HI>November;</HI> during that time &s;carce any other Wind blows. The Winds called <HI>Meri&s;&s;i</HI> are hot, they &s;poil the Corn, and are hurtful to every thing; but the&s;e nouri&s;h and refre&s;h, not only the Corn, but are comfortable to Man and Bea&s;t, for they are cooling, and give &s;trength.</P>
<P>They &s;top the Mouth of the River, and cau&s;e the Waves to &s;end back the water of <HI>Nilus,</HI> which makes it to &s;top and &s;well over the Banks to water the Earth, and fill all the Chan|nels with water.

<P>The common people are Thieves, Lyars, trea|cherous, and &s;o greedy of gain, that for the love of a <HI>Meidin</HI> they would kill their own Fathers.

<HI>which is about</HI> 12 <HI>Degrees from the Equi|noctial towards the We&s;t, and in the Province of</HI> Saca|hala, <HI>inhabited by the</HI> Agaus
<HI>in a Field of no great extent, incompa&s;&s;ed about with many high Moun|tains, there is a little Lake over which one may ca&s;t a &s;tone, full of Bu&s;hes and low Trees, whereof the Roots are &s;o thick and intangled, that in Summer one may walk upon them. In the middle of this Lake are two great and deep Fountains very near together; from hence i&s;&s;ues out a clear water that runs under the&s;e Bu&s;hes and low Trees in two &s;everal Channels: towards the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>and about the di&s;tance of a Mus|ket-&s;hot, they turn to the</HI> North; <HI>about half a mile from thence there appears a great deal of water, and a con&s;iderable River, into which runs many other &s;treams; and about</HI> 15 <HI>miles from thence, it receives <PB N="28" REF="18">another bigger water, called</HI> Gema, <HI>which lo&s;eth then its name: a little farther, turning towards the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>it receives al&s;o two other con&s;iderable &s;treams, called</HI> Kelti <HI>and</HI> Branti; <HI>near this place is the fir&s;t fall of the River: Not much farther, in running towards the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>it enters into the Lake of the</HI> Aby&s;&s;ins,

<HI>then it enters into the Country of</HI> Funch, <HI>or</HI> Nubia, <HI>and from thence runs into</HI> Egypt, <HI>as Father</HI> Telles
<HI>affirms.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider be&s;ides, that when <HI>Nilus</HI> is fallen down the la&s;t Cataract near <HI>I&s;van,</HI> it runs from the
<HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North</HI> very &s;lowly, and di|vides it &s;elf below <HI>Boulac</HI> into two great Bran|ches, the one meets the Sea at
<HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> and the o|ther at <HI>Damietta.</HI> This latter divides it &s;elf into another Current at <HI>Sciobret il yemen,</HI> a Village &s;cituate on the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> about half-way between
<HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Damietta,</HI> which runs into the Sea at
<HI>Brullos.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e three branches, there is a fourth which is artificial, and full of water; but about thirty days of the year, it begins at a Village <PB N="29" REF="18">called <HI>Latf,</HI> on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> in going to <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> about thirty miles from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where the waters of this Current run into the Sea; therefore the <HI>Egyptians</HI> reckon it among&s;t the true Mouths of the River <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether be&s;ides the&s;e four there be any other, as
<HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirm, for they reckon about &s;even. But <HI>Egypt</HI> is much alter'd; &s;o that there is no appearance nor remembrance of the &s;even Cities where they were, as they &s;ay.</P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> I enquir'd from the Inhabitants concerning this particular, but they could not give me any account, but only of the&s;e four. Some told me, that be&s;ides the great Cur|rent at
<HI>Damietta,</HI> there was another artificial Channel at <HI>Gaza,</HI> where the waters did run into the Sea, but I cannot believe it: but if this were true, <HI>Gaza</HI> is not in <HI>Egypt;</HI> therefore it cannot be one of the &s;even Mouths of the River <HI>Nilus</HI> &s;poken of by the Ancient Geographers. I could wi&s;h that &s;ome other curious Traveller would en|quire them out, and tell us the truth.</P>
<P>This is remarkable of <HI>Nilus:</HI> 1. That it begins to increa&s;e and decrea&s;e on a certain day preci&s;ely. 2. That when it fir&s;t increa&s;eth it grows green. 3. That afterwards it appears red; and 4. That it changeth its Channel &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>The day in which it begins to increa&s;e is year|ly the 12th of
<HI>June</HI> of the <HI>Copties,</HI> or the 17th day of our <HI>June,</HI> on which day they ob&s;erve the Fea&s;t of S. <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angel, on which day the drops fall. Now the&s;e drops are nothing el&s;e, according to the judgment of the Inhabi|tants, but the Mercies and Ble&s;&s;ings of God:
<PB N="30" REF="19">They believe on that day God &s;ends the Arch-Angel S.
<HI>Michael</HI> to cau&s;e the River to be fruit|ful. This is the common Opinion of the people: But the Learned &s;ay, that the&s;e drops is a kind of a Dew which falls towards the la&s;t quarter of the night, near the morning; and which cau&s;eth the River to be fruitful, purifies the Air from all the infection of <HI>Cum&s;in,</HI> and gives &s;trength and vertue to all things upon which it falls.</P>
<P>The&s;e drops are doubtle&s;s the only cau&s;e of the fruitfulne&s;s of <HI>Nilus:</HI> this is ea&s;ily &s;een; for as &s;oon as this Dew is fallen, the water begins to be corrupt, and to be of a greeni&s;h colour; this colour increa&s;eth more and more, till the River appears as a Lake cover'd all over with Mo&s;s.</P>
<P>This colour is to be &s;een not only in its great Channel, but al&s;o in all the Ponds and Branches that come from thence, only the Ci&s;terns keep the water pure.</P>
<P>Some years this green colour continues about 20 days, and &s;ometimes more, but never above 40. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> call this time, when the Ri|ver is green, <HI>il chad raviat,</HI> for they &s;uffer much, becau&s;e the water is corrupt, without ta&s;te, and unwhole&s;ome, and that good water is very rare.</P>
<P>The&s;e drops or Dew purifies the Air, for as &s;oon as it falls, the Plague cea&s;eth to be mortal, none dies of it; the Air is whole&s;ome, all Di|&s;tempers cea&s;e, and if any per&s;on grows &s;ick, he never dies.</P>
<P>This Dew gives life to every thing; and when it falls upon the Wheat, it cau&s;eth it to continue many years without corruption, or worms, and is far more nouri&s;hing than that Corn upon which it never falls; For this cau&s;e they never <PB N="31" REF="19">hou&s;e the Corn of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> in the Barns, till this Dew is fallen upon it, that it might keep the longer without worms.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of the River proceeds from &s;e|veral cau&s;es; the fir&s;t and the chief is, the fer|mentation cau&s;ed in it by this Dew, which falls at the time mentioned before.</P>
<P>The continual Rains of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that come in <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> which is the Winter|quarter of that Country, and the great Torrents of water that run down from the Mountains in|to the Rivers that flow into <HI>Nilus,</HI> may be look'd upon as another cau&s;e of this increa&s;e, for I can|not conceive that the fermentation can continue
100 days, and cau&s;e it alone to increa&s;e &s;o much as it is wont.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e, in my judgment, are the We|&s;terly winds, called <HI>Mae&s;trals,</HI> and by the <HI>Egyp|tians Maltem,</HI> which begin to blow, as I have &s;aid, about 12 days before the Dew falls; name|ly, the fifth day of <HI>June,</HI> and continue after|wards about four Months without alteration. They blow &s;trait into the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> and hin|der the fre&s;h water from coming out, &s;o that it returns back, and cau&s;eth the River to &s;well.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ame Winds have cau&s;ed &s;everal Tra|vellers, and namely Mon&s;ieur <HI>Burattini</HI> to affirm, that the River ob&s;erves not a preci&s;e day to in|crea&s;e, but that it happens &s;ome years &s;ooner, others later; becau&s;e before the 17th day of <HI>June,</HI> the water did &s;eem to &s;well; but this is no real increa&s;e, the winds <HI>Mae&s;trals</HI> are the cau&s;es of this appearance.</P>
<P>The Ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> a&s;crib'd the cau&s;e of the &s;welling of <HI>Nilus</HI> to a &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom.
<PB N="32" REF="20">They bought a young Damo&s;el, adorned her with rich attire, and afterward ca&s;t her as a Sa|crifice into the River, on the 12th day of their <HI>Baony,</HI> or <HI>June:</HI> But when <HI>Amru-ibn il a&s;&s;</HI> had conquer'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> and taken it from the
<HI>Greeks,</HI> he aboli&s;h'd this damnable Cu&s;tom; which was ob&s;erved in that time, as <HI>Gaznevi</HI> a famous <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Hi&s;torian &s;aith.
<HI>Amru</HI> commanded the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI> to forbear and leave that act of cruelty; in that year it happen'd that the River did not increa&s;e, which caus'd the people to &s;u&s;pect and fear a great Famine, in&s;omuch that they re&s;olved to depart out of the Kingdom. This cau&s;ed <HI>Amru ibn il a&s;&s;</HI> to write to <HI>Amru ibn il Chottab,</HI> a <HI>Califf</HI> of
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> to de&s;ire his advice. This <HI>Califf</HI> &s;ent him a Letter written with his own hand for the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> commanding him to read it, and to ca&s;t it into the water; which as &s;oon as <HI>Amru</HI> had performed, the waters ro&s;e 16 Cubits in one night, the 14th of
<HI>September,</HI> which is commonly the la&s;t day of its increa&s;e. This was &s;ufficient to water the Country, and &s;a|tisfie the people.</P>
<P>Some of the Country that are ignorant of the true cau&s;es of this increa&s;e, imagine that it pro|ceeds from a large Pond in
<HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in the River it &s;elf, which the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> begin to open about the 12th of <HI>June,</HI> and by degrees let out the wa|ter more and more, till the 14th of <HI>September,</HI> at which time they begin to &s;hut it again; but this is a fooli&s;h fancy of the
<HI>Copties.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the green colour is gone, the River <HI>Nilus</HI> begins to become red, and very muddy; 'tis then no doubt but the fermentation is pa&s;s'd, and that the waters of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> are arriv'd in
<HI>E|gypt,</HI> <PB N="33" REF="20">which are of that colour, becau&s;e of the red Earth which the furious torrents from the Moun|tains carry into the River; for it is not po&s;&s;ible that the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is very black, &s;hould give it that colour. In the year 1673. in the beginning of
<HI>July,</HI> the water began to be red, which continued till the end of
<HI>December,</HI> the time that the River returns to its ordinary bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>They have an art to make this muddy water as clear as Cry&s;tal. As &s;oon as the Water|bearers have fill'd their Ve&s;&s;els, they rub them in the in&s;ide with a Pa&s;te made with pounded Almonds, which cau&s;eth the water to become in a &s;hort time very clear.</P>
<P>In the places where this Pa&s;te is not to be found, they u&s;e for that purpo&s;e the Kernels of Apricocks, pounded in the &s;ame manner. I was told, that the Flower of little Beans could per|form the &s;ame effect. The
<HI>Egyptians</HI> believe, that the River <HI>Nilus</HI> decrea&s;eth al&s;o at a certain day; namely, the 17th of their <HI>September,</HI> and the 24th of ours, the day which they ob&s;erve in remembrance of the Exaltation of the Holy Cro&s;s. They are &s;o fully per&s;waded of it, that if any &s;hould deny it, he would be look'd upon as ridiculous.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this belief, as I conceive, is,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the next day after this Fe&s;tival, all the Banks and Stoppages of the River, on this &s;ide the <HI>Cairo,</HI> which were before kept &s;hut, and guarded by armed men, that &s;uch as need the water for their grounds might not open them, are cut and removed, and the water let into the Country. By this means the River &s;preads a|broad more than before, and its water returns <PB N="34" REF="21">not back, which makes them &s;ay, that it ri&s;eth and &s;wells no more.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e the day after the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> they do not take notice of its increa&s;e at the Pillar of <HI>Mikias,</HI> nor publi&s;h it about the Town, as before; they believe therefore that this is done, becau&s;e the River never increa&s;eth after.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e when the &s;ea&s;ons of the year in
<HI>Egypt</HI> are regular, the winds <HI>Mae&s;trals</HI> that help to make the River &s;well, cea&s;e after the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> and the Southerly winds ri&s;e, driving the waters out of the Fields.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e rea&s;ons appear &s;trong enough, to prove the Opinion of the <HI>Copties,</HI> one cannot without offending them &s;ay, that the River may yet increa&s;e after that day, becau&s;e the winds
<HI>Mae&s;trals,</HI> and the rains of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> may &s;ome years continue a longer time than ordinary, and &s;o the River may increa&s;e a little, not to be per|ceived: for the&s;e winds have blown till the Month of
<HI>November.</HI> In the year 1672. at the <HI>Calliz</HI> of <HI>Cairo</HI> it was vi&s;ible, that the water was ri&s;en three fingers higher than the day before, in the night of the Exaltation of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s.</HI> It may be &s;aid, that this increa&s;e was not real, but only cau&s;ed by &s;ome &s;toppage at the pa&s;&s;age of the River, or at one of the Bridges of the Chan|nel out of the City: For my part, let every one believe what &s;eems mo&s;t likely.</P>
<P>From hence we may &s;ee how much &s;ome Tra|vellers have been mi&s;taken, when they have en|deavoured to per&s;wade us, that the River
<HI>Nilus</HI> never increa&s;eth above 40 days: For if you reckon the beginning of its increa&s;e, from the <PB N="35" REF="21">17th of <HI>June</HI> till the 14th of <HI>Septemb.</HI> the day of its decrea&s;e, you &s;hall find that it increa&s;eth du|ring 100 days at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater Te&s;timony of this, than the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Copties,</HI> who in their Ru|brick have a form of prayer for the increa&s;e of the River, which they &s;ay from the 12th day of <HI>Baoni,</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> till the 8th of <HI>Babe,</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> which is in all 120 days. In which prayer they de&s;ire, that God would cau&s;e the River to ri&s;e to its nece&s;&s;ary height, to water &s;ufficiently the Country, as <HI>Abulbaracat,</HI> a famous Author a|mong&s;t the
<HI>Copties,</HI> &s;aith in his work called <HI>Mo&s;|bah iddolme,</HI> which I have brought from <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> altogether ignorant, a&s;cribe this ordinary decrea&s;e to a Miracle. They ob&s;erve the Fe&s;tival of the Exaltation of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> at which time they ble&s;s a Cro&s;s at the Celebra|tion of the <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> which they ca&s;t into
<HI>Nilus,</HI> and imagine that this Cro&s;s &s;tops the increa&s;e of the River.</P>
<P>Their Patriarch was wont to perform this Ce|remony with great pomp and &s;tate; but becau&s;e the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> &s;uffer them not to go in Proce&s;&s;i|on about the Cities publickly, their Prie&s;ts ob|&s;erve this Cu&s;tom every one in his own Vil|lage.</P>
<P>The waters of this River have &s;everal Opera|tions. 1. They cau&s;e a Loo&s;ene&s;s to the new|comers, if they drink of them at their fir&s;t arri|val, which continues about eight days. 2. They cau&s;e an itch in the skin, which troubles &s;uch as drink of them when the River increa&s;es. This itch is very &s;mall, and appears fir&s;t about the Arms, next upon the Stomach, and &s;preads all <PB N="36" REF="22">about the Body, which cau&s;eth a grievous pain. This Itch comes not only upon &s;uch as drink of the River, but &s;uch as drink of the waters of the Ci&s;terns filled with the River water. It la&s;ts a|bout &s;ix Weeks. 3. About the Month of <HI>June, July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> it turns into a &s;wet, but is not &s;o in any other time of the year. 4. When this water covers the Earth, it fats the Land with the &s;lime that it leaves behind. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Th.</HI> is mi&s;taken in his Travels into the <HI>Levant,</HI> when he &s;aith, that this &s;lime makes the ground &s;o fat, that if they did not mingle Sand with it, the ground would rot, and choak what is put into it; and that in <HI>Egypt</HI> they take as much pains to carry Sand into the ground, as we do to carry dung. This is not generally &s;o; for they never u&s;e Sand, but for Melons, Cucumbers, and &s;uch like Fruits, which grow only in &s;andy ground; they never u&s;e Sand for other Fruits and Grains.</P>
<P>When the River runs over, it makes a great de&s;truction; it carries away not only great pie|ces of the Bank, but de&s;troys &s;ometimes Towns and Villages near to it. This may ea&s;ily be per|ceived by the ruines of the Hou&s;es, and the old Walls, &s;een all along the &s;ides of the River.</P>
<P>Sometimes it alters its Channel. I have read in the
<HI>Mekkin,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;torian, that about the time that the
<HI>Arabians</HI> conquer'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> the wa|ter was &s;o high, as to touch the Walls of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;r I&s;&s;c&eacute;mma,</HI> a part of the old <HI>Cairo;</HI> and that it ran near the Church of <HI>Mary Moncure,</HI> which is in that of the Patriarchs, in the Street called in that time
<HI>H&aacute;ret il bahr,</HI> The Street of the Ri|ver; <PB N="37" REF="22">whereas now it is above a mile off from this place.</P>
<P>One day as I was walking out of the old <HI>Cai|ro</HI> in the Fields, near the Church of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;hewed me a Garden near adjoyning, which was about 10 years ago upon the Banks of the River, but at pre&s;ent it is above a Musket &s;hot off, becau&s;e the River hath taken as much ground on the other &s;ide, as it hath le&s;t on this.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee whether the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> are able to divert the cour&s;e of the River, and cau&s;e all the Inhabitants to peri&s;h with hunger, as &s;ome imagine. I am of this Opinion, though the Father <HI>Telles</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth and alledgeth many diffi|culties in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons that oblige me to believe it po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Letter of <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;ir|named <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> written to <HI>Abu &s;eid Barc&uacute;k,</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the year of the Martyrs, 1193. I have a Copy of it written in <HI>Arabick,</HI> in which he threatens him in two di&s;tinct places of his Letter, to turn a&s;ide the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> and hinder it from entering into <HI>Egypt,</HI> to cau&s;e all the In|habitants to peri&s;h with hunger, if he continues to vex the <HI>Copties,</HI> whom he names his Brethren. He &s;aith, that he hath received from God this priviledge, which he had not di&s;cover'd to any of his Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> have hin|dred the Current of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and turn'd it out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the days of <HI>Mo&s;tan&s;ir,</HI> one of the <HI>Ca|liffes</HI> of <HI>Egypt;</HI> which obliged him to &s;end the Patriarch of the <HI>Copties</HI> with rich Pre&s;ents to the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> to intreat him to take away
<PB N="38" REF="23">the Bank which he had rai&s;ed to turn a&s;ide the River. The King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> having granted him this reque&s;t for the Patriarchs &s;ake, the Ri|ver increa&s;ed in one night three Cubits, which was &s;ufficient to water the Fields with that water that was there before; as we may &s;ee in the Hi|&s;tory of the <HI>Mu&s;ulmans</HI> of <HI>George le Mekkin.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that Strangers may take notice of in &s;ailing upon the River, is the great number of I&s;lands, whereof &s;ome be very great,
20 miles in compa&s;s: They proceed fir&s;t from the &s;hip|wrack of Ve&s;&s;els that have &s;tuck in the mud. This happens frequently through the unskilful|ne&s;s of the Mariners, and the mud of the River, the &s;lowne&s;s of the Current, the dirt and mire gathers immediately about any thing that &s;tops there; by this means the&s;e places increa&s;e into I&s;lands. Almo&s;t every day new I&s;lands are di&s;|coverable: And becau&s;e the State of
<HI>Egypt</HI> ne|ver chang'd &s;ince the Conque&s;t of Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> and that the&s;e I&s;lands have been made &s;ince, they are not recorded in the Rolls of the <HI>Divan</HI> of that time. From hence it is that they pay no|thing to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> but belong to the <HI>Pacha,</HI> who lets them out to the <HI>Ca&s;ciefs</HI> of the Province, where the&s;e I&s;lands are &s;cituated, or to whom he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Several Pillars have been erected in divers times to mea&s;ure the ri&s;ing of the River.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was at <HI>Menuf,</HI> or <HI>Memphis,</HI> built by
<HI>Jo&s;eph Jacob&s;on.</HI> When this fell to ruine, a rich Lady of the
<HI>Copties,</HI> named <HI>Deluca,</HI> erected two others; one at
<HI>In&s;ine,</HI> or <HI>Thebe,</HI> and the other at <HI>Achmin.</HI> When this la&s;t decayed, the <HI>Greeks</HI> built one at <HI>Ca&s;&s;r I&s;&s;cemma,</HI> whereof the Ruines are yet to be &s;een, as &s;ome &s;ay.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="23">
<P>Ater that <HI>Amru ibn il A&s;&s;</HI> had conquered
<HI>E|gypt,</HI> he cau&s;ed one to be built at <HI>In&s;ine</HI> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. This remained entire till the days of <HI>Abd il aziz ibn Mervan,</HI> a <HI>Califf</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who cau&s;ed one to be built at <HI>Helvan,</HI> a place where he delighted to dwell.</P>

<HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<P>It is, as they &s;ay, of white Marble, of an <HI>O|ctogone</HI> figure, &s;tanding in a Pond of water, into which the water of <HI>Nilus</HI> enters in by a large Channel. It is divided upon the eight Angles in|to two and twenty Cubits, from the top to the bottom: The fir&s;t is divided into 24 equal parts, called Fingers; the &s;econd is not divided; the third is divided as the fir&s;t; thus alternatively, till the eleventh Cubit. The fir&s;t Cubit of the &s;econd &s;ide is not divided, the &s;econd is divided into four and twenty thumbs, the third is not, thus, till the eleventh, which with the others, to the bottom, are divided into eighteen fingers or thumbs. All the other &s;ides are divided in the &s;ame manner; &s;o that all the Cubits which are divided in a &s;ide, an&s;wer to the Cubits which are not divid|ed in the other &s;ide. The increa&s;e of the River is di&s;cerned from the top to the bottom. The
<HI>Cop|ties</HI> &s;ay that <HI>John Mekaukes,</HI> a famous Man of their Nation, and a Governour of <HI>Egypt,</HI> for the Emperour <HI>Heraclius,</HI> laid the Foundations of this Palace, and of the Church which is near a

<P>When Chri&s;tianity flouri&s;h'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> it be|long'd to one of their Prie&s;ts to examine the in|crea&s;e of the River; which action was perform|ed three hours after midnight, and after Ma&s;s. This is very likely. The la&s;t Prie&s;t of the <HI>Copties</HI> that mea&s;ured it, was named <HI>Raddat,</HI> who conti|nued in that Office by making him&s;elf a
<HI>Mahume|tan,</HI> that none but his Po&s;terity might have this
<PB N="41" REF="24">Office. <HI>Ibn Raddat,</HI> who now executes this Fun|ction, is de&s;cended from him, and is a <HI>Caddi</HI> by Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> are Enemies of the
<HI>Copties,</HI> they ob&s;erve &s;ome Cu&s;tomes now which were then kept, when their Prie&s;ts did mea&s;ure the River; for they do this about Even-&s;ong, that is, about three hours in the afternoon.

<P>When <HI>Ibn Raddat</HI> hath taken notice of the number of the Fingers that &s;ignifie the increa&s;e of the River, he takes three times the water in the hollow of his hand, and flings it as often in|to the air: He repeats afterwards the Chapter of <HI>Fatha,</HI> and departs with the news of the ri&s;ing of the water to the <HI>Pacha.</HI></P>

<P>They that are imployed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, ob|&s;erve a particular Cu&s;tom: They never declare exactly the number of the fingers of the in|crea&s;e, but always keep back &s;ome, till the time <PB N="42" REF="25">comes that the <HI>Calitz</HI> is to be cut. For example, if
<HI>Nilus</HI> be increa&s;ed ten fingers the fir&s;t day, they will declare but &s;even or eight the next day, and will conceal three or four: if in ano|ther day it increa&s;eth twelve fingers, they will di&s;cover but eight or nine, and keep back three or four. Thus they continue 20 days, till the time comes that the Bank is to be cut that hin|ders the River from running into the Channel of <HI>Cairo;</HI> then they reveal &s;ome of tho&s;e fingers which they conceal'd. All which they con&s;tantly perform, until the day comes that they cry out <HI>Ouf Alla,</HI> that the River is come to its perfect in|crea&s;e to water all the Fields of <HI>Egypt.</HI> They ob|&s;erve this method, as they &s;ay, to cau&s;e more re|joycing in the people, by di&s;covering a great ma|ny fingers at once, at the time when the Bank is cut.

<HEAD>Of the Well of <HI>Argenus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have taken notice of one particular thing concerning
<HI>Nilus,</HI> worthy of the knowledge of our Learned Wits, which never any Travel|ler of <HI>Europe</HI> hath yet given any account of. At
<HI>Argenus,</HI> or <HI>Gernus,</HI> as &s;ome call it corruptly, a Village near <HI>Behne&s;e,</HI> a Town &s;cituate in the middle of <HI>Egypt,</HI> there is a Mona&s;tery of <HI>Copties,</HI> with a Church dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, where there is a Well whereof the waters in|crea&s;e and &s;well every year, that &s;ame night in which the Dew falls, in &s;uch a manner, that from thence it is ea&s;ie to gather how many Cubits the River will ri&s;e that year above &s;ixteen. To know this, they ob&s;erve this Cu&s;tom.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="25">
<P>The Evening before the Dew falls, the <HI>Cadi,</HI> together with the Elder of this Town, goes to the Church with a little Cord of Cotton, having eight knots di&s;tant from one another about a thumb; at the end there is a piece of Lead, which they let down into the Well in the pre|&s;ence of a crowd of people. As &s;oon as the Lead touches the top of the water, they tye the &s;tring, and &s;top the Well, &s;ealing it with their Seal: Afterwards they go to the Church, and continue there till the morning, at which time they examine how much the water is ri&s;en that night, for at break of day they take away the Seal, they open the Well, and draw up the Cord. Now by the ri&s;ing of the water in the Well, and the number of the knots that are wet, they can Progno&s;ticate how many Cubits the Ri|ver will ri&s;e that year above &s;ixteen. They reck|on a Cubit for every knot that is wet: For exam|ple, if there be four knots wet, they under&s;tand that the River will ri&s;e four Cubits that year, that is in all twenty; &s;o they judge of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I know not whether this be true, or whether it be but a Cheat, as the late holy <HI>Greek</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> of

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Crocodile.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Crocodile,</HI> in <HI>Arabick</HI> called
<HI>Tim&s;&aacute;h,</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable and mo&s;t curious Animal belonging to the River <HI>Nilus.</HI> I have therefore thought that it de&s;erv'd a particular De&s;cription among&s;t the Fi&s;hes of this Current. That it might be the more punctual and exact, I &s;hall fir&s;t repeat what
<HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, and afterwards add what I have taken notice of. This Learned <PB N="45" REF="26">Naturali&s;t tells us that <HI>The Crocodile is an Animal with four Legs that makes a grievous de&s;truction both in the Water, and out upon the Land. Of all the Creatures that live upon the Earth, this alone is with|out a Tongue, and this alone moves the upper-jaw in eating. It hath two ranks of great Teeth, and com|monly it is longer than</HI> 18
<HI>Cubits. It produceth Eggs about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e-Egg, that it &s;its upon them out of the Water, and lays them at the place un|to which the Water is to ri&s;e that Year, when it is at its highe&s;t; as if it had a knowledge of this before-hand. It is the only Creature that ri&s;eth from &s;uch a &s;mall be|ginning, to &s;uch a prodigious bigne&s;s. It is Armed with Claws to defend it &s;elf. Its Skin on the Back is &s;o extraordinary hard that no Weapon, never &s;o &s;harp, is able to enter it. In the Day-time it lies upon the Ground, and &s;pends the Nights in the Waters. When its Belly is very full, it &s;leeps upon the Bank with its Mouth open; then there comes a little Bird, named</HI> Trochilos, <HI>To eat the remains of the devoured Prey which &s;ticks between the Teeth: with this Food it nou|ri&s;hes it &s;elf, and by the picking of the Teeth it gives the</HI> Crocodile <HI>a plea&s;ure, which cau&s;eth him to fall a&s;leep in this po&s;ture. At that time the</HI> Ichneumon <HI>takes notice of the</HI> Crocodile <HI>at a di&s;tance, and when it &s;ees its time it enters into the others Mouth, &s;lides down the Throat into the Belly, and gnaws the Entrails; with this the</HI> Crocodile <HI>dies. In the Ri|ver</HI> Nilus <HI>are al&s;o,</HI> as he &s;aith, Dolphins <HI>which have a very &s;harp Back, with which they kill the</HI> Cro|diles <HI>that pur&s;ue them continually.

This Creature,</HI> <PB N="46" REF="27">&s;aith he, <HI>is very bold and daring to them that run from it, but timerous and fearful if it be pur&s;ued. It is very weak-&s;ighted in the Water, but out of the Water it is quick. In the Winter it &s;pends four Months in &s;ome Cave, without eating. It lives long, and grows continually till it dies.</HI></P>
<P>This is the account that <HI>Pliny</HI> gives of the
<HI>Cro|codile.</HI> We will a little examine what he &s;aith, and to that we &s;hall add our own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It is true that the <HI>Crocodile</HI> is a very dreadful Creature in <HI>Egypt,</HI> becau&s;e of the great de&s;tructi|ons that it makes in the Water, and out; for it devours not only all the Fi&s;h that it can catch in the River, but al&s;o the Camels, the Hor&s;es, the Sheep, the wild Beeves, the Dogs, and little Children. In &s;hort, all that it can catch upon the Land, it draws into the River, and eats it.</P>
<P>Concerning its length, which <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith is commonly above 18 Cubits, I mu&s;t needs con|fe&s;s that I know not how many Inches are his Cu|bits; for, many Hunters of <HI>Crocodiles</HI> have a&s;|&s;ured me that it grows never above a Cubit in length in a Year; and when it comes to twelve years old it grows no more: &s;o that, according to this account, the longe&s;t
<HI>Crocodile</HI> is not above 12 Cubits in length. If this be true, the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Author, whom <HI>Ibn Beitar</HI> mentions in his Book of Animals and Plants, is mi&s;taken, when he &s;aith, that there are &s;ome
<HI>Crocodiles</HI> that have their Tails 6 Cubits long, their Head two, and the re&s;t of their Body 8.</P>
<P>The Eggs that he lays, which are &s;ometimes in Number 30, never
100, as a certain Traveller affirms, are as big as the Eggs of Au&s;triches;
<PB N="47" REF="27">three-times bigger than Gee&s;e-Eggs. As &s;oon as they are out of its Body, it carries them into &s;ome I&s;land of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and puts them into a hole made with its fore-feet, it covers them with Sand, and &s;mooths the place where they lye that no Per&s;on might di&s;cover them. In this conditi|on it leaves them, till by a natural In&s;tinct it knows that the young are formed. It goes then and opens the hole and breaks the &s;hell with its Mu&s;le for the young to creep out. As &s;oon as they are in the Air, they run &s;trait to the River. And becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e Eggs are rotten, it is from this corruption that a certain <HI>Lizard,</HI> name|ed by the
<HI>Arabs, Varal,</HI> is ingendred. We &s;hall &s;peak of this Serpent in the &s;equel of our Di|&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>That which <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith of the <HI>Trochilos</HI> re|quires a further inquiry; for one might ask an hundred years in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> what this Bird is, and yet none is able to give an account.
<HI>Beitar</HI> &s;aith this of it, when the <HI>Crocodile</HI> is full with the de|voured Prey, he goes out of the Water to &s;leep in the Sun; and becau&s;e its Teeth are full of &s;lime and filth, in which the Worms are ingen|dred; a certain Bird, as little as a <HI>Teitavi,</HI> en|ters between his Jaws, eats up the &s;lime, and the Worms, if there be any; and when the
<HI>Croco|dile</HI> feels that all is clean, he &s;huts his Mouth to eat the Bird al&s;o. But Nature hath provided an expedient to &s;ecure it; there are two &s;harp pricks on the top of the Birds Head, which when the
<HI>Crocodile</HI> feels, he opens his Jaws again for the Bird to e&s;cape out.</P>
<P>I inquired from &s;everal <HI>Moors,</HI> whether they knew any Bird that had any pricks on the Head? <PB N="48" REF="28">They an&s;wered, they knew none. They told me, that there is in <HI>Egypt</HI> the <HI>Saksak,</HI> a Bird that keeps the <HI>Crocodile</HI> always company, which I have &s;een very often, and which lives upon the filth that &s;ticks about, and between, the
<HI>Crocodile</HI>'s Teeth. Whether therefore the <HI>Saksak</HI> of the
<HI>Moors,</HI> and the Bird mentioned by <HI>Beitar,</HI> be the
<HI>Tro|chilos</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> I leave to the Reader to judge.</P>
<P>Concernining the <HI>Ichneumon,</HI> named by the <HI>Arabians, Nims,</HI> by the <HI>Italians, Sorca di faraone,</HI> and by the
<HI>French-men, Rat d' Egypte.</HI> It is very true that it creeps into the Mouth of the <HI>Croco|dile,</HI> enters into its Belly, which it gnaws to the very Entrails; the like happens to the Camels, and wild Beeves, and other Animals, when they &s;leep in the Fields.</P>
<P>That which <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;peaks concerning the Dol|phins is not likely, for there be none in the River. But it may be it is the
<HI>Tir&s;e,</HI> which is the only Fi&s;h that a&s;&s;aults the
<HI>Crocodile.</HI> This <HI>Tir&s;e</HI> is as round as a Buckler which eats the young <HI>Croco|diles</HI> when it can meet them.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Crocodiles</HI> can live a long while with|out eating, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, is a truth which I have &s;een by experience by two that I have kept alive a long while. I had one in my Clo&s;et about a Foot long, and another &s;ix in my Cellar. I cau|&s;ed the latter to be tied with a great Cord about the Jaws, that it might not offend &s;uch as came to &s;ee it. They lived both about a Month without eating. The <HI>Moors</HI> told me that they could &s;ub|&s;i&s;t forty days without any nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>They have, in all, three-&s;core and twelve great Teeth, very &s;harp; &s;ix and thirty in the upper-jaw, and as many in the lower: So that
<HI>Ibn Beitar</HI> <PB N="49" REF="28">is mi&s;taken, when he &s;aith in his Hi&s;tory of Ani|mals, which I have &s;ent to the King's Library, that they have three&s;core in the upper-jaw, and forty in the lower; and that between every two &s;harp and great Teeth, there is one &s;quare and little one; for I have &s;een many alive and dead, but have never found this difference in the Teeth, but rather I have always found them to be &s;harp and uniform.</P>
<P>Its four Paws are furni&s;hed with great Hooks, or Claws, very &s;harp; the two Fore-feet having five di&s;tinct, &s;eparated the one from the other; the two hinder but four, which are all joined to|gether by a very thin skin, as are the Feet of all Sea-fowl, as Gee&s;e and Ducks.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian</HI> Authors &s;ay, That it ca&s;ts out its Excrements by the Throat, becau&s;e it hath no hole under the Tail, and its Stones have the &s;mell of Musk; but as I have had no experience neither of one nor t'other, I refer my &s;elf to their Re|lation.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the <HI>Crocodile</HI> cannot well turn it &s;elf up|on the Belly when it lies upon the Back, and that it is needful that the Female be in that po&s;ture when the Male covers her. The Male takes care when he hath laid her upon her Back and perform|ed his duty, to turn her again upon her Belly, for fear of the Hunters.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o taken notice, that from the City <HI>Cairo,</HI> towards the upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> there are many <HI>Crocodiles</HI> to be found, where they do much mi&s;|chief; but from thence towards the lower
<HI>Egypt</HI> are very few, and they &s;ay, that they be not dan|gerous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> give two Rea&s;ons of this; they &s;ay,
<PB N="50" REF="29">That one of their Saints, named <HI>Sidi Ibrahim il Zuphi,</HI> or <HI>The Lord Abraham of Zug,</HI> hath con|jur'd them to hinder them from pa&s;&s;ing beyond the City <HI>Cairo,</HI> and bound them to hurt no body. The other Rea&s;on is, as they &s;ay, becau&s;e under the Pillar or
<HI>Mikias</HI> there is a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> that kills them as &s;oon as they draw near.</P>
<P>But it is mo&s;t certain that there are &s;ome on this &s;ide the <HI>Cairo</HI> to be &s;een, though not &s;o fre|quently as on the other. This proceeds, as they &s;ay, from the <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> that is turn'd up-&s;ide down in this Pillar, and therefore lo&s;eth its great|e&s;t vertue; therefore they can pa&s;s beyond it, &s;wimming upon their Backs.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Sangiac-Beys</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Egypt,</HI> as well as in other Countries &s;ubject to the Grand Seignior, there are &s;everal <HI>Sangiac-Beys,</HI> who be Governors of great Pro|vinces.</P>
<P>They are &s;o called in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tongue from two words, <HI>Sangiac,</HI> which &s;ignifies an En&s;ign, and <HI>Bey,</HI> a Prince; becau&s;e when the Grand <HI>Vi|zier,</HI> or the <HI>Pacha,</HI> makes them, he delivers into their hands an En&s;ign, as a mark of their Dig|nity.</P>
<P>They that may pretend to this Dignity are the <HI>Agas of the Boulouks, the Chieftains of the &s;even Orders of the Militia of Cairo,</HI> and the <HI>Metferracas.</HI></P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the&s;e Lords are
<HI>Melte&s;i|m&iacute;ns,</HI> or Farmers of the Provinces that they hold from the <HI>Divan,</HI> at the rates mentioned in the Rolls: heretofore &s;ome
<HI>Beys</HI> have Farmed four|&s;core Villages, or Towns. They Lett the&s;e Vil|lages to under Farmers, and the u&s;ual Rent of every Town, is known to every one, chiefly to the <HI>Meba&s;cicr&iacute;ns,</HI> or Scrivners of the
<HI>Copties.</HI></P>
<P>About twenty years ago this honour was pur|chas'd with the expence of twenty Pur&s;es, or thir|ty: This was called <HI>Chidmet il Sangiakie.</HI> And as &s;oon as any Per&s;on was made <HI>Bey,</HI> the
<HI>Divan</HI> did allow him half a Pur&s;e every Month, as his Sal|lary; and when he travell'd to any Place, for the &s;ervice of the Grand Seignior, at his return to <HI>Cairo</HI> the <HI>Divan</HI> did give him half a Pur&s;e more for his Reward. In that time the&s;e <HI>Beys</HI> wore in great Credit, and Power; for when they de|clar'd their opinion in the <HI>Divan,</HI> the
<HI>Pacha</HI>'s <PB N="59" REF="33">were afraid to contradict them. They did &s;ome|times depo&s;e them, when they did not amend their manners after a reproof. They were wont to be &s;ix and thirty in Number.</P>
<P>But now they are a great deal le&s;s, and are re|duc'd to that condition, that they are not much e&s;teem'd. This Honour now co&s;ts them fifteen Pur&s;es, and their Allowance given to them by the <HI>Divan</HI> is one thou&s;and A&s;pers every day. So A&s;pers is 4 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6
<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Their Office is, to Conduct the <HI>Hazna,</HI> or Trea|&s;ure, of the Grand Seignior to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or to Command the
<HI>Caravan</HI> that travels towards <HI>Mecha;</HI> and to go to War, when required. Four of them are to watch always round about <HI>Cairo,</HI> with a Company of Jani&s;&s;aries.

<P>In the Year 1672, when I was at <HI>Cairo,</HI> there were &s;ixteen <HI>Beys,</HI> here be their Names.</P>
<P><HI>Sulfucar</HI> was <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Girge,</HI> but he was ca&s;hier'd in the Month of <HI>September</HI> in this Year. <HI>Jezbee</HI> was made <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Carge</HI> in his &s;tead. <HI>Mohammed Abu Sciav&aacute;reb,</HI> or <HI>Mahomet</HI> with the great Whisk|ers.

<P>The <HI>Hil&eacute;lgie</HI> is a great Tree full of prickles.

<P>I Set Foot in <HI>Diametta</HI> the 18th day of <HI>Feb.</HI>
1672. where I abode till the 8th day of the next Month: Sometimes lodging in the City, &s;ome|times in the Barque that had brought me, becau&s;e it was loaden with Wine for the Con&s;ul, and <HI>French</HI> Merchants of
<HI>Cairo:</HI> And the <HI>Aga</HI> of the City would not &s;uffer the Wine to be carried a-&s;hore, nor into the Haven, until the <HI>Pacha</HI> had &s;ent him an expre&s;s Order to that purpo&s;e. He dealt in this manner, becau&s;e the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> had &s;ent very &s;trict, and &s;evere orders, to forbid the Im|portation of Wines in all his Dominions. And Becau&s;e I was in the company of a Servant of the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul, whom I could not leave with Ci|vility, becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand the <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Tongue; I was therefore ingaged to be his In|terpreter, by the Obligations that he had laid upon me in my Voyage: For his, and his Ma&s;ters &s;ake, I abode with him till the orders were come, and a <HI>Jani&s;&s;ary</HI> to Guard the Wine to <HI>Cairo.</HI> They loaded therewith two great Barques, and we de|parted immediately for <HI>Damietta,</HI> on <HI>Saturday,</HI> the 8th of
<HI>April;</HI> and were at <HI>Boulac,</HI> a Suburb of <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Eve of <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Here follows the mo&s;t remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages, and the De&s;cription of the Towns, and Places, which are from the Mouth of the River at <HI>Damietta,</HI> <PB N="66" REF="37">as far as <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> as they lye in order.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we enter into the River, from the Sea, we find on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, at the Mouth, an old Ca&s;tle ruinated, but &s;mall; which, as the <HI>Francs</HI> &s;ay, was built by S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, when he had <HI>Damietta.</HI> It is &s;quare, and divided into four round Turrets, upon which &s;ome Ar|tillery have been planted to command the Pa&s;&s;age, and where a few <HI>Moors</HI> are upon the Guard.</P>
<P>A little further into the River &s;tands a poor Village, named
<HI>Bogas,</HI> or Mouth of the River; becau&s;e it is there &s;cituated. The
<HI>Arabian</HI> word <HI>Bogas</HI> &s;ignifying &s;o much.</P>
<P>In this Village dwell the Owners of the <HI>Germes</HI> (being Long-Boats made to un-load Ships and draw them out of the Sands) that guide and tow along the Ships that &s;ail in or out of the River; and di&s;cover to them the Banks of Sand, which are very ordinary in this Road.</P>
<P>In this Village is to be &s;een the Foundation of another &s;quare Fort, the Walls whereof are not yet fini&s;h'd, and never likely to be. There are al&s;o here two <HI>Calitz,</HI> or Artificial Channels, full of the River-water all the year; made on purpo&s;e to water the Fields.</P>
<P>About an hundred Paces from this Village, on the other &s;ide, is another Ca&s;tle to command the Mouth; &s;o that the two Ca&s;tles that are there planted for this purpo&s;e, are not over again&s;t one another.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the City of <HI>Damietta.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DAmietta,</HI> called by the <HI>Arabians, Dami&aacute;t,</HI> a famous City of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is &s;cituate upon the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> about eight Miles from the Mouth. Next to <HI>Cairo</HI> it is the greate&s;t, mo&s;t beautiful, the riche&s;t, the mo&s;t populous, and the fulle&s;t of Merchants of all <HI>Egypt;</HI> for the con|veniency of Trade draws thither a great number of People form all parts of <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>It is built upon the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> in the form of an half Moon. The Waves of this River that wa&s;h the Foundations of their Hou&s;es on that &s;ide, and the great number of beautiful <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> together with the Fleet of Ships and Barques that ride in the Haven, yield a mo&s;t delightful Pro|&s;pect.</P>
<P>There are no Walls, nor Fortifications, only a round, and very high Tower, that &s;tands at the end of the Town towards the Sea; where there is neither Watch nor Ward, nor Guns.</P>
<P>In this City there is great Trading in Linen, Rice, Coffee, and Stuffs. I was told, that eve|ry year, about five hundred Ships go out of this Haven, &s;mall and great, loaded with Rice for <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>Here are made many beautiful &s;orts of Linen of all kinds and colours, which are Tran&s;port|ed to Foreign Countries. Here is al&s;o a great deal of Fi&s;h &s;alted. The <HI>Mullet</HI> that are here pickled are highly e&s;teem'd all over the <HI>Le|vant.</HI></P>
<P>The Town is Governd by an <HI>Aga,</HI> &s;ent thither from the
<HI>Pacha,</HI> and therefore nam'd by the <HI>Turks, <PB N="68" REF="38">Pachaga&s;i,</HI> or the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Pacha.</HI> Be&s;ides his other Incomes, he takes from every Tavern of <HI>Aqua|vitae</HI> ten
<HI>Pora's,</HI> in the City are a great many &s;uch Taverns. From every
<HI>Carache</HI> (it being a little Ship) he receives five <HI>Pora's;</HI> and from greater Ships &s;ix and thirty, and forty, when they go out of the Port: Be&s;ides many Ca&s;ualties which a|mount to a great deal, through his extortion, as the manner of the <HI>Turks</HI> is: for, out of our Ship he took &s;ix Barrels of <HI>Cyprus</HI>-wine, containing each &s;ix <HI>Metres,</HI> and every <HI>Metre</HI> holding twenty Pots, though this was not his due. I had &s;ome difficulty to &s;ave from his greedy hands a Box of excellent Wine of the Country of <HI>Ke&s;rovan.</HI></P>
<P>The Souldiery, and chiefly the <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries,</HI> are very in&s;olent. There be but two hundred, and about twenty
<HI>Spahins.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Chri&s;tians, the <HI>Grecks</HI> are the mo&s;t nu|merous. They be about two hundred Families, and have a con&s;iderable Church.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Copties</HI> there be about eight Families. The
<HI>Turks,</HI> about a year &s;ince, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Church, becau&s;e they had not paid them a certain Tax that they had laid upon them.</P>
<P>There are no <HI>Francs</HI> that dwell there in the Ci|ty for want of Trade; becau&s;e this Haven is at a little di&s;tance from all the Chri&s;tian Countries, and becau&s;e they are &s;ettled at <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> which lies more convenient for them, and nearer. There is only a Chamber which the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> of the ho|ly Land have hired in the Apartment of the
<HI>Greek</HI> Patriarch, which is a little Hou&s;e, very filthy, yet they Lodge there when they pa&s;s to and fro from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to
<HI>Cairo.</HI> The greate&s;t Traffick in this City, by Sea, is of Wood and Timber which <PB N="69" REF="38">is Imported as well for Fewel as for the building of Hou&s;es and Ships; for Wood is very &s;carce in <HI>Egypt,</HI> chiefly in the Inferiour.</P>
<P>During my abode in this City I met with an old Ship-Captain, by Religion a <HI>Maronite,</HI> who told me, that between this City and the Town of <HI>Bogas,</HI> the River <HI>Nilus</HI> grew &s;hallower every year; and that he had taken notice, that about fifteen years ago it was fifteen Cubits deep; but now &s;carce fifteen Foot. This proceeds from the Earth, which the Water loo&s;ens from its &s;ides and wa&s;hes into the middle; about the Mouth of the River there the Earth &s;tops. He gather'd from thence, that it was to be fear'd, that in this River great Ships would not be able, one day, to pa&s;s from the Mouth to <HI>Damietta.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Man&s;oura,</HI> i. e. <HI>Victorious,</HI> the a|bode of the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of <HI>Dekahlie,</HI> is a great and beautiful Town, &s;cituate upon the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus.</HI> Its Hou&s;es are not builded as tho&s;e of <HI>Damietta,</HI> upon the Water, but there is a large Street between them for to walk; but becau&s;e we Landed not then in that place, I had not the opportunity to view it, nor to give an exact De|&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay this of it, That in this Town the
<HI>French</HI> King, S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner by Sul|tan
<HI>Saleh, negm iddin, eiiub ibn il Kamel.</HI> All the particulars of the end, and carrying on of this War, are to be &s;een in the <HI>Macrizi,</HI> and in
<HI>Ibn Zulak.</HI> I could wi&s;h the&s;e Hi&s;tories of the
<HI>Ara|bians</HI> were Tran&s;lated into any known Languages, for here are &s;everal remarkable Circum&s;tances mentioned in them, with which we are not ac|quainted. Here are likewi&s;e many Ver&s;es full <PB N="70" REF="39">of Wit, but Satyrical, made then by the <HI>Moors,</HI> upon the taking of S.
<HI>Lewis,</HI> and the conclu&s;ion of this War, &s;o happy for their Nation.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Damietta</HI> and Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> are to be &s;een, upon the River &s;ide, a prodigious number of Pigeon-hou&s;es, which is here remarkable, be|cau&s;e there are not found &s;o many in any other part of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> nor builded in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pigeon-hou&s;es begin at <HI>Mitbedri,</HI> a Vil|lage near <HI>Man&s;oura,</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ide, in &s;ailing towards
<HI>Cairo.</HI> In one days Journey and a half I &s;aw &s;o many, that I wondred at it; for there is &s;carce a Hou&s;e in all the Villages but there is one, or more Pigeon-hou&s;es. At the Foundati|on the Walls are of Earth only, and round on the top, very &s;pacious within, full of Earthen Pots for the Pigeons Ne&s;ts; and without are ma|ny Poles for them to pitch on, and re&s;t them|&s;elves. It is ea&s;ie to judge whether the &s;ight, and Pro&s;pect of &s;o many Pigeon-hou&s;es be not very delightful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> that were in our Boat told us, that in the&s;e Villages fifteen Pigeons were commonly &s;old for one <HI>Para;</HI> forty <HI>Para's</HI> make 4 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6
<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> So that I reckon, that about two hundred and for|ty Couples were &s;old for that Money.</P>
<P><HI>Semennut</HI> is a great Town, &s;cituate on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> in the <HI>Ca&s;cieftik</HI> of
<HI>Garbie,</HI> not far from <HI>Mohelle Kab&iacute;re,</HI> or the great
<HI>Mohelle.</HI> It is built in a Triangular Form; the lower part &s;tretches it &s;elf along the River. The Barques that &s;ail towards <HI>Cairo</HI> are bound to &s;top here, and pay Cu&s;tome: The Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e is built upon a Ship, in the River, at which the Ve&s;&s;els ne|ver &s;top above an hour.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="39">
<P>In the middle Way, between <HI>Diametta</HI> and <HI>Cairo,</HI> is <HI>Mitgamr,</HI> a very beautiful and large Town, &s;cituate upon the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus.</HI> We landed, and I found there many fair Hou&s;es, and a &s;paci|ous <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place, where all manner of Provi&s;ions were to be &s;old. Here are al&s;o a great many Chri&s;tians of the <HI>Copties.</HI></P>
<P>Over again&s;t <HI>Mitgamr,</HI> that is on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide <HI>Nilus,</HI> is <HI>Sitfe,</HI> a beautiful and big Town, belong|ing to to the <HI>Ca&s;cieftik</HI> of <HI>Mohelle Keb&iacute;re;</HI> where we beheld a pur&s;uit of &s;ome Pea&s;ants, whom the
<HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of that Province chas'd. They were come to demand a certain Tribute, which he was wont to pay them: and upon his denial of it they ro&s;e up in Arms again&s;t him: But as &s;oon as he had &s;ent out the
<HI>Spahins</HI> again&s;t them, they ran all away. The&s;e poor
<HI>Caitiffs</HI> being on Foot, and finding them&s;elves followed by Hor&s;e-men; that they might not fall into their hands, they ca&s;t them&s;elves, in ha&s;te, into the River to &s;wim over; &s;ix were unhappily drown'd before our Eyes.</P>
<P>In the upper <HI>Egypt</HI> is a Village, named al&s;o
<HI>Sitfe;</HI> which I &s;hall mention in another place.</P>
<P>The 12th of <HI>April,</HI> about two a-Clock in the Afternoon, we left one of the Branches of <HI>Ni|lus</HI> that leaves the main River and runs to <HI>Dami|etta,</HI> and entred into the <HI>Bogas,</HI> or Channel of
<HI>Boulac.</HI> The clear Weather gave me the liberty to take notice of the &s;eparation of the two Bran|ches of the River: I found that the Branch that goes to <HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> &s;tretches it &s;elf to the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and that of <HI>Diametta</HI> to the <HI>North.</HI> In re&s;pect of this la&s;t, <HI>Cairo</HI> &s;tands to the <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and its Ca&s;tle to the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>At this <HI>Bogas</HI> the two great <HI>Pyramides</HI> of
<HI>Egypt</HI> <PB N="72" REF="40">are fir&s;t di&s;cover'd: They appear here to be equal, though one is far higher than the other.</P>
<P>From this &s;eparation, or divi&s;ion of <HI>Nilus,</HI> as far as <HI>Boulac,</HI> there is but an hour and a halfs travelling, though Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> tells us of &s;ix Leagues.</P>
<P>We landed at <HI>Boulac,</HI> the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before
<HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> at Night. I &s;taid there till the next Morn|ing, and entred into <HI>Cairo</HI> about Noon. At my entrance I paid a Crown, at the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e of <HI>Boulac,</HI> which is an ordinary Tribute demand|ed of all <HI>Francs</HI> many years ago.</P>

<P>MY de&s;ign at fir&s;t, was to publi&s;h a large De|&s;cription of all the Rarities of this great and famous City, before I proceed on in my Jour|nal: But &s;ince I have con&s;idered that great Vo|lumes are wont to nau&s;eate, rather than to delight the Reader, chiefly in the&s;e days that Men are pleas'd with the reading of &s;hort and &s;mall Vo|lumes: I have therefore taken notice of tho&s;e things only which other Travellers have omitted, and could never know perfectly for want of an in&s;ight into the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue. He that will know more, may peru&s;e the &s;econd Part of the
<HI>Chottats</HI> of <HI>Macrizi.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Cairo</HI> borrows the Name from the Planet
<HI>Mars,</HI> called by the <HI>Arabians, Kaher;</HI> which Name was given to it, as &s;aith the <HI>Serr&uacute;r,</HI> an <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Hi&s;torian, becau&s;e the Foundation of its Walls were laid when this Planet was in its a|&s;cent; which hapned unhappily in this manner.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="40">
<P><HI>Giauher,</HI> the General of <HI>Meez le d&iacute;n all&aacute;,</HI> one of the <HI>Cailiffs</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> having re&s;olved to build a new City for the abode of his Lord, in the Year 362 of the <HI>Hegira;</HI> he gave orders to the A&s;tronomers, to ob&s;erve the time of the ri&s;ing of a good Star, when the Foundation might be laid; that the City might be the more happy, and of a longer continuance.</P>
<P>The A&s;tronomers accordingly encompa&s;&s;ed about with Ropes, all that &s;pace of Ground that was to be &s;hut into the Walls; tying to the Ropes a great many little Bells, to give notice to the Builders when they were to ca&s;t the Foundation: The &s;ignal was, the &s;ounding of the Bells; which was to be given when they &s;aw the ri&s;ing of a good Star.</P>
<P>By chance it happen'd, that a Crow pitch'd up|on the Ropes that was &s;tretch'd along, when <HI>Mars</HI> was in its ri&s;ing; and with the motion of the Ropes cau&s;ed the Bells to &s;ound: As &s;oon as the Ma&s;ons heard the &s;ignal given, they ca&s;t all, with one con&s;ent, the Foundation: which when the A&s;tronomers had under&s;tood, they declar'd by unlucky ri&s;ing of <HI>Mars,</HI> that govern'd at that In&s;tant, that the City &s;hould be one day taken by a Conqueror that &s;hould come out of
<HI>Roma|nia,</HI> where <HI>Mars</HI> governs: Which hath proved true about five hundred and three&s;core years af|ter, when <HI>Sultan Selim</HI> came from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Romania,</HI> and took not only the City, but the whole Country; and de&s;troyed the Race of their Kings, by hanging the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Though they conceived that this Star would prove unlucky, they called the City neverthe|le&s;s <HI>Kahera,</HI> or <HI>Cairo,</HI> as we name it in <HI>Europe:</HI> <PB N="74" REF="41">which Name continues till this day. This City is become very rich, powerful, and great, by its Trade; in&s;omuch, that of all the Cities of the <HI>Levant,</HI> this alone hath de&s;erv'd the name of Great.</P>
<P>It is &s;cituate in a Champain, very delightful, at the Foot of a Mountain of Sand, named in <HI>Arab. Gebel il mokattam,</HI> or the Mountain cut through, which &s;tands on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, and incommodes the City; becau&s;e it deprives it of the benefit of the fre&s;h Winds that blow from thence. This Ci|ty hath another inconveniency, it is far from the River.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the World more delight|ful, than to take a pro&s;pect of it from &s;ome emi|nent place: for you might from thence view an infinite number of Hou&s;es, which, in&s;tead of Coverings, have Turrets; and &s;ee an innumera|ble company of <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> with their various co|lours of differing Buildings intermingled, and &s;urrounded with Palm-trees, and Gardens; all which together repre&s;ents a mo&s;t beautiful Pro&s;pect.</P>

<P>Heretofore they had many Churches, and Mo|na&s;teries; and a Bi&s;hop in the <HI>Chandak,</HI> an old Suburb of <HI>Cairo,</HI> but now ruinated. But now they have but two; one Dedicated to the Arch-Angel

<P>Of the many <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> at <HI>Cairo,</HI> that which is called <HI>Giama ill a&s;&s;ar</HI> is the riche&s;t, and the great|e&s;t. It was built by <HI>Giauher,</HI> the fir&s;t Founder of the City: It is yet the Cathedral, where the four <HI>Mouftis,</HI> or Doctors of the

<P>They have power to excommunicate the <HI>Pa|cha's</HI> when they attempt to do any thing again&s;t their Religion, or their <HI>Mo&s;ques.</HI> For In&s;tance, they excommunicated <HI>Pacha Ibrahim</HI> in the year 1672, becau&s;e he offered to take away &s;ome of the Gifts, and Rents, belonging to the <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> of <HI>Cairo:</HI> By that means they hinder'd him from executing his &s;acrilegious de&s;ign. When the Excommunication prevails not, they &s;hut the Gates of this <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> which cau&s;es the People to ri&s;e up in Arms; and they never are quiet, till they have kill'd the Offender.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cairo,</HI> and in its Suburbs, there are nine pub|lick Shambles belonging to the Grand <HI>Seignior:</HI> 1. That of

<HEAD>The way of Hatching Chickens at <HI>Cairo.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The 21&s;t of this Month I went to &s;ee the O|vens where the Chickens are hatched. The&s;e Ovens are builded in the &s;ame manner as the O|vens of <HI>France,</HI> made to bake Bread, only with this difference; they are not &s;o high, nor &s;o big as ours, nor of burnt Brick, but of Brick dried in the Sun. They have al&s;o, on the top, a round hole, as big as the circumference of a <HI>French</HI> Hat, through which the heat mounts up and goes out, which Ovens for Bread have not.</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e where I &s;aw them, they were plac'd in this manner. There were four and twenty: twelve on the right hand, and twelve on the left; &s;ix one upon another. At the fir&s;t &s;ight one would have thought them to be &s;o many Sleeping-cells of Monks: but the Alley that was between
<PB N="83" REF="45">was &s;o narrow, that when I enter'd in, the &s;moak and heat that came out had almo&s;t &s;tifled me.</P>
<P>Now, to cau&s;e the Egs to be hatch'd, they put them all in the lowermo&s;t Ovens; and in the up|permo&s;t they kindle a &s;mall Fire, for eight days, with Straw. Afterwards they &s;top them, and leave them &s;o &s;ix other days: Then they take a|way the Egs from the lowermo&s;t Ovens, and &s;epa|rate the good from the bad, by examining them in the Sun-&s;hine. Afterwards they ca&s;t away the addled, and put all the good in the upper|mo&s;t Ovens; making, with Straw, a &s;mall Fire in the lowermo&s;t, for two days. They leave them in that condition one and twenty days, without medling with them: at which time the Chickens begin to break the Shell; &s;o that in two and twenty days they bring forth Chickens in this manner.</P>
<P>This is not to be practis'd, but during four Months in the Year; namely, from the Month of <HI>December,</HI> till the Month of <HI>April:</HI> The other part of the Year is not fit for this purpo&s;e, be|cau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive heats.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Pyramides.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN my fir&s;t Voyage to <HI>Egypt</HI> I had &s;een the
<HI>Py|ramides;</HI> but, having another opportunity offer'd to me, I went thither to view again the&s;e rare Monuments of Antiquity, to &s;ee whether I might not ob&s;erve &s;omething more than I have taken notice of in my fir&s;t Relation.</P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>April</HI> I went thither, in the Company of the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul, and many other <PB N="84" REF="46">Merchants, and with almo&s;t all his Hou&s;hold: we had with us three <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> to guard us, &s;o that we were in all about fifty Cavaliers, well mounted upon A&s;&s;es; taking with us Provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for three days.</P>
<P>When we were come to the <HI>Pyramides,</HI> and had ob&s;erv'd exactly every thing: I took notice that the place where they &s;tood was a Burying-place. This is plain to any that &s;ee the place; and doubt|le&s;s it was the burying-place of the old City <HI>Memphis;</HI> for all the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;tories inform us, that this City &s;tood where the
<HI>Pyramides</HI> now are, over again&s;t Old <HI>Cairo.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I took notice that all the <HI>Pyramides</HI> have an entrance that leads to a low Alley, which is very long; and at the end is a Chamber, where the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> did place the Bodies of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, for whom the <HI>Pyramides</HI> was built. This entrance is not to be &s;een in every one of the <HI>Pyramides,</HI> becau&s;e the Wind hath &s;topt them with Sand. I &s;aw upon &s;ome of them &s;ome
<HI>Hierogliphick</HI> Characters, but I had not time to write them out.</P>
<P N="3">3. I took notice that all the <HI>Pyramides</HI> were builded in very good order; and that each of the three greate&s;t were at the head of ten le&s;&s;er, which are not well to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e of the heaps of Sand: one may yet imagine, to &s;ee the place, that in former Ages there have been here one hundred <HI>Pyramides,</HI> little and great.</P>
<P N="4">4. I took notice that they are all builded upon an even Rock, covered over with white Sand; &s;o that it is very probable that the Stones have been taken from the place, and not brought from <PB N="85" REF="46">far, as &s;ome Travellers imagine, and old Wri|ters: for the greate&s;t is nothing but a Rock cut as a <HI>Pyramide,</HI> and covered over with a Wall of Stone.</P>
<P N="5">5. I took notice that of all the Stones of the greate&s;t, there is &s;carce one entire, but either worn out with the Weather and Time, or bro|ken by &s;ome other Accident; &s;o that, though one may a&s;cend on all &s;ides to the top, yet not in all places with the &s;ame ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. I have taken notice that none of the
<HI>Pyra|mides</HI> are alike, or perfectly &s;quare; but that all have two &s;ides longer than the others. I intend|ed to mea&s;ure the greate&s;t: for that purpo&s;e I had with me a String of about thirty Land|yards; but becau&s;e the Winds have heap'd a|bout it Mountains of Sand, I could not po&s;&s;ibly draw a Line &s;trait from one Angle to the other.</P>
<P>On the 28th day of <HI>December</HI> I went to &s;ee the
<HI>Pyramides</HI> the third time, with &s;ome &s;trangers. In our way we were mightily troubled with a ve|ry thick Mi&s;t, which la&s;ted till ten a Clock in the Morning; and we found a great deal of Mud in the Trenches and Ditches, which was not yet dry &s;ince the retreat of the River; &s;o that we were carried over upon the <HI>Moors</HI> backs that were with us.</P>
<P>At this time I went up to the top of the great
<HI>Pyramide;</HI> and I ob&s;erv'd, as at the fir&s;t, that the place where the <HI>Pyramides</HI> &s;tand, is a pure Rock, cover'd over with white Sand; which appears &s;ufficiently by the Ditches and Caves round about the
<HI>Pyramides</HI> cut in the Rock.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Rock is to be &s;een, upon which &s;tands the greate&s;t <HI>Pyramide,</HI> by a hole at one of the <PB N="86" REF="47">Angles, between the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and the <HI>North</HI> &s;ides.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Pyramides</HI> are not builded with Marble, as &s;ome &s;ay; but with a white &s;andy Stone, very hard.</P>
<P N="4">4. The greate&s;t hath but two hundred and &s;ix &s;teps; and though Mon&s;ieur <HI>Th.</HI> &s;aith that it hath two hundred and eight, this proceeds from his not taking notice that two &s;teps are broken into four.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the top of the greate&s;t <HI>Pyramide</HI> there was anciently a Statue, or <HI>Colo&s;&s;e.</HI> This appears, becau&s;e it is not &s;harp as the others, but plain: And there are yet to be &s;een great Pits, which were to keep fa&s;t the <HI>Colo&s;&s;e</HI> from falling.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there is nothing on the top but ma|ny Letters of the Names of Per&s;ons or all Nati|ons, who have left them to witne&s;s that they had been there. There is no &s;ign of the Play at <HI>Man|cala,</HI> which a <HI>Coptie</HI> told me was there imprinted in the days of the
<HI>Pharaoh's.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Stones of the bigge&s;t <HI>Pyramide</HI> are not equal; for &s;ome of the undermo&s;t are four Foot high, &s;ome three Foot and an half, and five Foot long. The Stones of the middle are three Foot and five Inches high, and the uppermo&s;t Stones are but two Foot high, and three and an half long.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;ides of the <HI>Pyramides</HI> are not equal; for in the greate&s;t it is vi&s;ible, and &s;o in the o|thers, that the
<HI>North</HI>-&s;ide is longer than that which &s;tretches from
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. In all the <HI>Pyramides</HI> there are very deep Wells cut in the Rock, &s;quare; as I have &s;een in more than ten.</P>
<P>On the 26th day of <HI>June</HI> I went the fourth time
<PB N="87" REF="47">to &s;ee the <HI>Pyramides,</HI> in the Company of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sabatery,</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>In the Pa&s;&s;age to Old <HI>Cairo,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River, I took notice of one thing very re|markable in its Channel: The Water was per|fectly green, as a Cake covered over with green Gra&s;s. This was the fir&s;t time that I &s;aw it of this colour; which cau&s;ed me to ask of the Boat-men, what this green colour was? They told me, tint the River
<HI>Nilus</HI> did then putrifie, that it had continued &s;o fifteen days, and would be &s;o five more. Some of them &s;aid, that there was none could remember to have &s;een the River &s;o green as that year, 1672.</P>
<P>To return again to the <HI>Pyramides:</HI> I went up this time to the top of the highe&s;t <HI>Pyramide:</HI> I enter'd into the Chamber, but &s;aw no new thing which could cau&s;e me either to change, or add to my former Ob&s;ervations. It is needle&s;s to &s;peak of its Dimen&s;ions, &s;eeing &s;o many Travellers have already publi&s;h'd them, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> in his <HI>Levant</HI> Travels.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Pyramides</HI> we went to take a view of the Caves that are adjoining. There are many, all cut in the &s;ide of a Rock: Their out-&s;ides are out of order, without any proportion; but their in-&s;ide very equal, and polli&s;h'd. In every one there is a deep Well &s;quare, cut in the Rock, where the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did put the Body of that Per|&s;on, for whom the Cave was made; for it was their Sepulchre. The walls of many of the&s;e Caves are full of Hieroglyphick Figures, carved in the Rock. In &s;ome they are but &s;mall, in o|thers very lively. In one I number'd &s;ixteen great Figures, that repre&s;ented eight Men and eight <PB N="88" REF="48">Women, holding one another by the hands; with many other &s;mall Figures, or Shapes, on both &s;ides.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Sphinx.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;aw next the <HI>Sphinx,</HI> near the <HI>Pyra|mides,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide. On the top &s;tands the Head of a Woman of an extraordina|ry bigne&s;s and height. The <HI>Arabians</HI> call it
<HI>Abul|hon,</HI> or <HI>Abul-houl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that it was the Tomb of King
<HI>Ama|&s;is.</HI> I imagine that this <HI>Sphinx</HI> was a Sepulchre, but we cannot under&s;tand that it belong'd to <HI>Ama|&s;is;</HI> for all the Records and Traditions of this <HI>Sphinx</HI> are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>That it is a Tomb may appear, Fir&s;t by its &s;ci|tuation, which is in a place which was in former Ages a Burying-place; and near the
<HI>Pyramides,</HI> and mortuary Caves. Secondly it is to be imagined that it was a Sepulchre from its building. In the hinder part is a Cave under ground, of a bigne&s;s an&s;werable to that of the Head, into which I have look'd by an entrance that leads into it; &s;o that it could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e but to keep a dead Corps.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Francs</HI> have, out of an exce&s;s of curio|&s;ity, climb'd up by the means of Rope-Ladders, to &s;ee whether this Head was hollow, or ma&s;&s;ie; and they have found it to be hollow, but filled at pre|&s;ent with Sand.</P>
<P>The Neck is worn out round about, which cau&s;eth Men to imagine that it will not be able to &s;upport the weight of that great Head.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="89" REF="48">
<HEAD>Of the Wells where the <HI>Mommies</HI> are.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we had fully viewed this <HI>Sphinx,</HI> we took the Road that leads to <HI>Sacc&aacute;ra,</HI> a Vil|lage, at four hours travelling from the <HI>Pyramides,</HI> and about eight from <HI>Cairo</HI> towards the
<HI>South.</HI> The Burying-place of the <HI>Mommies</HI> is near adjoin|ing to this Village.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e it was very late, and that we were to agree with the <HI>Arabians</HI> of the Village about the Price, the Number and Quality of the Wells that they were to open for us. We &s;topt there all Night, and the next Morning we took with us twelve Hor&s;e-men, to Guard us, of the
<HI>Arabians;</HI> with them we went to this Burying-place, where the
<HI>Mommies</HI> are in Caves under ground.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Well that we &s;aw was that of Birds Embalmed. When we had cau&s;ed the Sand that &s;tops the Wells Mouth to be removed, through which we were to go down, and from thence to enter into the Cave; we cau&s;ed our &s;elves to be let down one after another, by tying a double Rope about our middles. As &s;oon as we were at the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Taper, and &s;everal Matches that we had brought, we went into the Cave creeping upon our Bellies. The Cave is an Alley in the Rock, about the height of a Man, and about the breadth of a Perch; and of an extraordinary length. We found there many other Alleys on both hands, cut in the Rock; where were many large &s;tores, full of Earthen Pots, covered over with Coverings of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. In the&s;e Pots were Embalmed Birds <PB N="90" REF="49">of all kinds, every Bird in its own Pot. And as I thought that the remembrance of a Cu&s;tom &s;o ancient, and &s;uper&s;titious, was worthy of our notice, I brought about half a dozen with me; &s;ome I have &s;ent to the King's Library. We found al&s;o &s;ome Hens Egs, empty, but entire with|out any ill &s;mell or crack.</P>
<P>When we had viewed &s;ufficiently this Cave, we returned up in the &s;ame manner that we went down, and found another open'd, called the Virgin; which is, that was never open'd before: According to our orders to the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Tiger</HI> and the others went down in the &s;ame manner as into the former; I alone could not follow them, becau&s;e of a
<HI>Quartain</HI> Fever which had troubled me fourteen months, and took me at that very Moment: But I lo&s;t nothing by that: for the&s;e Gentlemen told me at their return, that they found an horrid &s;tench, and a clo&s;e air, that put out their Candles, and their Matches al&s;o, every time that they endeavour'd to light them; which cau&s;ed them to get up again without entring further. They told me that this Well was much deeper than the former.</P>
<P>We cau&s;ed another to be open'd, which was not a Virgin Well, as the former, becau&s;e it was not &s;o deep. I ventur'd into that, notwith&s;tand|ing my indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>We found there two <HI>Mommies,</HI> a great one, and a little one of a Child, both in Coffins, the great|e&s;t was of Marble; upon the Covering it had the likene&s;s of the Per&s;on for whom it was made: We caus'd the&s;e Biers, or Coffins, to be open'd, but found nothing extraordinary; therefore we made no account of them, and left them where we found them.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="49">
<P>We went down next into a Cave, called <HI>The Church,</HI> which was not &s;o deep as the former. It was nothing but a long Alley under ground, well Plai&s;ter'd, and Painted all over with Hierogly|phick Figures round about the &s;ides. It was al|mo&s;t all full of Sand, which cau&s;ed us to creep a|long upon our Knees.</P>
<P>If the Reader de&s;ires a Pro&s;pect, and a De|&s;cription of this ancient Burying-place, let him think upon a boundle&s;s Champain, even and co|vered over with Sand; where neither Trees, nor Gra&s;s, nor Hou&s;es, nor any &s;uch thing is to be &s;een: Let him repre&s;ent to him&s;elf the Superfi|cies of this large Field full of dry Bones of Arms, Legs, Feet, and Heads; full of &s;cattered pieces of Wood of Coffins, of little Idols, &s;ome of Wood, others of Plai&s;ter embolli&s;h'd with green, and mark'd before and behind with Hierogly|phick Letters. The&s;e Idols the <HI>Arabians</HI> have taken from the broken <HI>Mommies</HI> which they have ca&s;t away. In &s;ome places you may &s;ee great Tomb-&s;tones, full of Cyphers and enigmatical Figures that repre&s;ent &s;omething of Chymi&s;try, and of other Sciences and My&s;teries; and full of &s;trange Characters that are no Hieroglyphicks. Whiles I was looking upon this Spectacle the <HI>Arabians</HI> brought me two, whereof I cau&s;ed the Coppies to be drawn as &s;oon as I was returned to
<HI>Cairo.</HI></P>
<P>You have here a De&s;cription of &s;ome Relicks of the Grandeur and Vanity of the ancient <HI>Egyp|tians,</HI> and the mournful &s;igns of Man's Mortali|ty.

<P>In this Champain, or Field, here are fifteen <HI>Pyramides:</HI> three are of an extraordinary big|ne&s;s, which &s;eem to have been favour'd by Time; for they appear entire without much decay. Here is al&s;o an entrance in every one, that &s;hews a long Alley which leads to a Chamber; Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>de Tiger</HI> went into that which is farthe&s;t from the Village, commonly named <HI>The Pyramide of Rodope,</HI> where he found nothing in the Cham|ber.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pyramide</HI> is built as a Pavillion. The
<HI>Francs</HI> &s;ay that <HI>Rodope,</HI> a famous Strumpet, caus'd it to be built with the Money that &s;he had gotten with the lo&s;s of her honour. But this is doubtle&s;s an error, if it be true what <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, That the <HI>Py|ramide</HI> of <HI>Rodope</HI> was but &s;mall, though very beau|tiful; therefore this which is one of the greate&s;t in all <HI>Egypt</HI> cannot be that of <HI>Rodope.</HI> The&s;e are the words of <HI>Pliny: Supremumque illud ne quis Re|gum opes miretur, minimam extiti&s;&s;e laudati&s;&s;imam &agrave; Rodope meretricula factam. Ae&s;opi fabularum Phi|lo&s;ophi con&s;erva quondam, &amp; contubernalis haec fuit, majore miraculo tantas opes meretricio e&s;&s;e conqui&s;i|tas quae&s;tu.</HI></P>
<P>For the others that are in the &s;ame Field, Time hath almo&s;t worn them out; for they are but &s;o many heaps of Sand, which have &s;carce the &s;hape and &s;hadow of what they have been here|tofore.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a &s;quare heap of very great hewn Stones. The
<HI>Arabians</HI> name it <HI>Ma&s;tabet Faraoun:</HI> for they &s;ay, that when the <HI>Pharaoh's,</HI> Kings of <HI>Egypt,</HI> were to declare and give a new <PB N="93" REF="50">Law to to the People, they &s;tood on the top of this heap. But the&s;e are the Traditions of the poor <HI>Arabians</HI> that have nothing of certainty.</P>
<P>To return to the Wells of the <HI>Mommies:</HI> as &s;oon as the
<HI>Francs</HI> have vi&s;ited any, the Wind, or the <HI>Arabians,</HI> fill the entry again full of Sand, to get a little Money at the &s;econd opening. This is the greate&s;t gain of the&s;e Wretches. The lea&s;t they take for to open a Virgin Well is thirty <HI>Pi|a&s;ters,</HI> becau&s;e they that make the Well to be o|pened, have the liberty to carry away all the Cu|rio&s;ities and
<HI>Mommies</HI> that he finds there.</P>
<P>We return'd, after two days ab&s;ence, to the City
<HI>Cairo</HI> again; and the 6th of <HI>May</HI> I went to vi&s;it the
<HI>Greek</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> who was then re&s;ident at <HI>Cairo</HI> about &s;ome concerns of his Mona&s;tery. Among&s;t other things, he told me that he had a Manu&s;cript of the Council of
<HI>Florence,</HI> differing from all tho&s;e Copies that are Printed in
<HI>Europe.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tiger</HI> hath a Copy of this &s;uppo&s;ed Original.</P>
<P>The Monks of this Mona&s;tery have a priviledge from
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> &s;igned according to the Cu&s;tome of that time by the impre&s;&s;ion of his Hand, which frees them from the <HI>Carach,</HI> or Tax, which the <HI>Mahometans</HI> require of the Chri&s;tians &s;ubject to them. This was the cau&s;e wherefore <HI>Mahomet</HI> granted them this favour, as the Arch-Bi&s;hop told me, to expre&s;s his thanks to that Hou&s;e for the kind entertainment which he had received at the hands of tho&s;e Monks when he kept, and watch'd over their Camels.</P>
<P>We di&s;cours'd afterwards concerning the Plague of the former Year. He told me, that it had &s;wept away &s;ix hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and <PB N="94" REF="51">Per&s;ons, but that it had &s;carce medled with any but the poor; and that of the richer fort &s;carce four hundred were dead.</P>
<P>This cau&s;eth me to &s;peak a word of Father <HI>Elzear</HI> of
<HI>Nants,</HI> a very worthy Per&s;on; and his Comrade, Father
<HI>Portais;</HI> both of the <HI>Capuchin</HI> Order, and zealous
<HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> whom this Plague carried away. The fir&s;t was buried out of the City <HI>Cairo,</HI> in a Field where the poor
<HI>Copies</HI> are buried, for who&s;e Conver&s;ion he was intended.</P>
<P>To honour the Memory of his Vertues, there is an Epitaph in
<HI>Arab.</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> upon a little Stone fixed upon his Grave; and becau&s;e I was well acquainted with him in my fir&s;t Voyage which I made into <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the Orders and Commands of <HI>Erne&s;t,</HI> Duke of
<HI>Saxa-Gota,</HI> in the Year 1664. I went to &s;ee his Grave, and to repeat for the re|po&s;e of his Soul, and as a Te&s;timony of my re|membrance and e&s;teem of his rare Qualities, the Prayer <HI>De profundis.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Journy to <HI>Gemiane.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen the time was come that the <HI>Copties</HI> ob|&s;erve the Fe&s;tival of the Aparitions of the Saints at <HI>Gemiane;</HI> becau&s;e I had not &s;een it in my fir&s;t Voyage, I went from <HI>Cairo</HI> on
<HI>Monday</HI> the 9th of <HI>May,</HI> with a Servant of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tiger,</HI> named <HI>Leonard,</HI> that could Paint very well, with &s;everal
<HI>Copties</HI> who came in our Company, becau&s;e they had nothing to di&s;charge the expence of this Journy. We went aboard at <HI>Boulac,</HI> and &s;et &s;ail for the Town of <HI>Man&s;oura,</HI> where we landed the 12th of the &s;ame Month.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="51">
<P>The next day we left <HI>Man&s;oura,</HI> taking a Boat for
<HI>Dia&s;t,</HI> a little Village &s;cituate upon the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Niltus;</HI> for here all Travellers that go to <HI>Gemiane</HI> from
<HI>Cairo</HI> are wont to land. It &s;tands about four hours journying from
<HI>Man&s;oura.</HI> At our landing we left our Boat and went by Land to
<HI>Bo&s;&s;at ino&s;&s;&aacute;ra,</HI> a little Mile di&s;tant from the Ri|ver, in the Land; we &s;pent there the Night, and lodg'din the Church of S.
<HI>George,</HI> with &s;everal other <HI>Copties</HI> whom we found there, who were bound al&s;o, as well as we, for <HI>Gemiane.</HI></P>
<P>The 14th day very early we proceeded on towards the third branch of <HI>Nilus,</HI> which be|gins, as I have already &s;aid in the De&s;cription of this River, at <HI>Sciobret il Yemen;</HI> which it hath pa&s;s'd near the Town of <HI>Mohelle Keb&iacute;re,</HI> or Great <HI>Mohelle,</HI> and near
<HI>Gemiane</HI> it di&s;charges it &s;elf in|to the Sea at <HI>Brullos.</HI> We march'd on into the Country, and when we came to this Branch of the River we found &s;everal Boats ready to carry us with the Current to <HI>Gemiane,</HI> where we land|ed about the Evening, not without &s;uffering many cro&s;&s;es, and inconveniences; becau&s;e the Ma&s;ter of the Boat, an <HI>Arabian,</HI> was a wicked Rogue.</P>
<P><HI>Gemiane</HI> is a famous Church of the <HI>Copties,</HI> built in a large Champain; very even and bound|le&s;s to the Eye, but very unfruitful, in the Pro|vince of <HI>Garbie</HI> in the I&s;le of
<HI>Delta.</HI> It &s;tands near the place where was anciently the City
<HI>Degue,</HI> called by the <HI>Copties Tekebi.</HI> On the <HI>We&s;t</HI> it hath the Great <HI>Mohelle,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> the Branch of the River that enters into the Sea at <HI>Brullos,</HI> and on the <HI>North</HI> the Mediteranean Sea. This Church hath five and twenty Arches, or I&s;les, that yield at a di&s;tance a very beautiful Pro&s;pect, <PB N="96" REF="52">though they be not in order nor equal in bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Church within is not yet fini&s;h'd, and there is but one Chappel whited with Lime, namely that where the &s;uppo&s;ed Apparition happens: there is al&s;o but one Altar, as in all other Churches of the
<HI>Levant.</HI> All the Iles, or Arches, &s;erve to a|dorn the Church, and to give light to it; for in every one there is a Window, and in &s;ome two. The Chappel where the Apparition happens is on the <HI>North</HI>-&s;ide, on the right hand as one enters in, and over again&s;t the Door.</P>
<P>During three days I examin'd this Appariti|on, and the cau&s;es from whence it proceeds as exactly as I could po&s;&s;ibly; and found it to be nothing el&s;e but the reflection of the Objects that went by the Church at a convenient di&s;tance, which being carried into the Chappel, by the Air, through the two Windows that give light. It re|pre&s;ents, over again&s;t upon the Wall, the Shadow which is like the Object that goes by: For Ex|ample; when a Hor&s;e-man goes by, there is to be &s;een upon the Wall, in a confu&s;ed manner, a Sha|dow of a Man on Hor&s;e-back. If it be a Wo|man that hath a Child in her Arms, one may &s;ee the Shadow of that appearance; and &s;o is it with all other things. Now the People being &s;uper|&s;titious and of a dull apprehen&s;ion, not know|ing how this happens, fancy that the Saints ap|pear to them.</P>
<P>They know and di&s;tingui&s;h them, according as they are painted in their Churches: For Exam|ple, when they &s;ee the Shadow that repre&s;ents a Cavalier, they &s;ay that it is S. <HI>George;</HI> for the
<HI>Copties,</HI> as well as the other People of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> repre&s;ent him as a Man on Hor&s;e-back, killing a <PB N="97" REF="52">Dragon. When they &s;ee a Woman carrying of an Infant in her Arms, they &s;ay that it is the ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin, becau&s;e they &s;ee her thus repre&s;ented in the Pictures of their Churches. When they &s;ee the Shadow of a Man on foot of a reddi&s;h co|lour, they &s;ay that it is S. <HI>Menna,</HI> becau&s;e they paint him with a red Habit. They di&s;tingui&s;h the other Saints in the &s;ame manner. They are &s;o much bewitch'd with the fancy of the reality of the&s;e Apparitions, that if any Per&s;on &s;hould offer to deny it, he would be in danger to be knock'd on the head.</P>
<P>It is in vain to an&s;wer that the Shadows that appear in this Chappel cannot be formed by the reflection of the Objects, becau&s;e the Windows, through which they come in, are at the <HI>North</HI>-&s;ide of the Church which never enjoys the Sun|&s;hine; and that therefore they be true and real Apparitions.</P>
<P>To this I reply, that it is not needful that the Church be enlighten'd on that &s;ide; but it is &s;uf|ficient that the Objects that pa&s;s by be en|lighten'd. Now if the Church had the light of the Sun on that &s;ide, the brightne&s;s of the light would di&s;cover too plainly the Shadows, and would take away all cau&s;es of admiration.</P>
<P>If any will &s;ay that &s;ome ingenious Per&s;on a|mong&s;t them hath built this Chappel, according to the Rules of the Optick Art, to deceive the Peo|ple with the&s;e Apparitions; I de&s;ire him to take notice that the
<HI>Copties</HI> are &s;o ignorant that they know not what this Art is. This Chappel, as the other Churches, hath been built in this man|ner without any de&s;ign to cozen the World; therefore this Reflection, which they name Ap|parition <PB N="98" REF="53">of the Saints, hath been di&s;cover'd by chance. Experience hath taught me this in other Churches which have not been builded no more than this to deceive the World with vain Appa|ritions. I have taken notice of it in the Church <HI>Bo&s;&s;at ino&s;&s;&aacute;ra,</HI> where I was on the 13th of the &s;ame Month, in the company of &s;ome
<HI>Copties</HI> that were going to <HI>Gemiane&punc;</HI> There I &s;aw the &s;ame Shadows, which two days after at <HI>Gemiane,</HI> they called S.
<HI>George,</HI> the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and S. <HI>Menna;</HI> &s;o that when the <HI>Copties</HI> perceived them they knew not what to &s;ay. By this we may judge, that this Church hath not been built by the Optick Rules of Art, and that only by chance the&s;e Shadows have appeared, and been taken notice of.</P>
<P>This Apparition continues three days follow|ing; in which time there is &s;uch a great concour&s;e of People, that one is ready to be &s;tifled. I per|ceived that they did call every Saint according to their devotion and re&s;pect, without order: And when they &s;aw &s;ome Shadows upon the Wall which had a relation with tho&s;e Saints that are painted in their Churches, they cry out for joy, in their Language, <HI>Selam lak Kaddis Filan; I &s;a|lute you &ocirc; Saint N. N.</HI> To this they add an Hymn proper to the Saint, and Prayers, tying upon the Wall &s;ome little cro&s;&s;es of Wax. Of all the Saints that their Church wor&s;hips, I have heard none called upon but the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, S. <HI>George,</HI> S. <HI>Menna,</HI> and S.
<HI>Porter.</HI></P>
<P>On this Fe&s;tival day all the <HI>Arabians</HI> there|abouts meet here, out of an ancient Cu&s;tome, to be treated for three days with the Revenues of this Church: When I was there, they could make up near five hundred Hor&s;e, and five hundred <PB N="99" REF="53">Foot. The Hor&s;e-men were Armed with a Lance, the Foot-men with a Club upon their Shoulders, pointed with Iron.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tome of feeding the <HI>Arabians</HI> there|abouts is very ancient; it comes from their pre|tending to be the Lords of the Country round a|bout where this Church is built, and therefore for this con&s;ideration they hinder not the Chri&s;tians, as they are able, from coming to this Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Epitrope,</HI> or Trea&s;urer of the Church, hath care to provide all things needful for their entertainment. He kill'd that year &s;even young Cows, two every day: He provided for them Rice, Bread, and Barly for their Cattel: He had a care al&s;o to &s;end for Cooks, and all Im|plements nece&s;&s;ary for a Kitchin; &s;o that the <HI>A|rabians</HI> had nothing el&s;e to do here, but to eat and drink and divert them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Twice every every day, the&s;e <HI>Arabians</HI> per|formed their War-like Exerci&s;es, to &s;hew their jolly humor, and to give &s;port to the A&s;&s;embly. The Hor&s;e-men played at <HI>Girit,</HI> or the Dart, by ca&s;ting it to one another, riding one again&s;t ano|ther and fencing therewith with much dexterity: The Footmen likewi&s;e skirmi&s;h'd one again&s;t a|nother very plea&s;antly with their great Staves.</P>
<P>The third day of this Fe&s;tival the <HI>Arabians</HI> have nothing given them but a Dinner, as &s;oon as they have eaten it they are to depart; &s;o that if two hours after any of them was found there, and that the
<HI>Beys</HI> Lieutenant hath any knowledge of him; he will cau&s;e him to be puni&s;h'd, either by the Pur&s;e, or a Ba&s;tinado: &s;o that none have li|berty to &s;tay there that day, but Chri&s;tians whom the <HI>Epitrope</HI> treats in the &s;ame manner as he doth the <HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<PB N="100" REF="54">
<P>I was one of the chief Per&s;ons invited, the Trea|&s;urer entertained me under his own tent with an extraordinary Banquet, only Wine was wanting; and Spoons, Forks, Knives and Napkins were not u&s;ed: The Meat was to be torn in pieces be|tween the Fingers, according to the Cu&s;tome of the Country. Afterwards, out of the Tent, a long Skin of Leather was &s;pread upon the ground for the ordinary People, where they were very well treated. I &s;hall fini&s;h this Relation with an advice to all <HI>Francs</HI> that intend to &s;ee this Fe&s;ti|val. They ought to take the &s;ame Way as we have done, becau&s;e it is the ea&s;ie&s;t, the mo&s;t com|modious, and the le&s;s dangerous. Let them get a good Tent; for there are no Lodgings, but in the open Air: Let them carry Wine, Strong-waters, Meat, Hens, Bread, and other things for nou|ri&s;hment during the Fe&s;tival: Let them al&s;o car|ry with them the Furniture of the Table, a Car|pet, a Cu&s;hion to &s;it upon, and &s;ome Coverlets for their conveniency, and to appear hand&s;om|ly. Water and Wood, are here plenty: There is Fi&s;h al&s;o to be &s;old; for the Fi&s;her-men of
<HI>Ni|lus,</HI> that is near adjoining, bring hither a great deal. I was provided with all the&s;e things, there|fore I appeared very decently.</P>
<P>There is here no danger of being robb'd; for the Lieutenant of the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Mohelle</HI> is al&s;o at this Fe&s;tival with a good Guard of <HI>Spahins,</HI> to prevent Di&s;orders, Quarrels, and Robberies which might happen among rude and barbarous People: So that in this place one may be with as much &s;afety as at <HI>Cairo</HI> in a Hou&s;e. Upon this account there happen'd a plea&s;ant Accident; a poor <HI>Arabian</HI> had taken from a Chri&s;tian a handful of Barly to give <PB N="101" REF="54">it to his A&s;s, he was taken upon the Fact: The Chri&s;tians immediately dragg'd him with a great noi&s;e, to the <HI>Beys</HI> Lieutenant to have him puni&s;h'd: Whiles they were leading him a great Tumult of People ran to &s;ee him; &s;ome upbraided him with his boldne&s;s and impudency to &s;teal, without ap|prehending the puni&s;hment of the Saints that ap|pear'd in their Church, and did &s;o many great Miracles; another ask'd him whether he did not fear that God would puni&s;h him? At which words he an&s;wer'd, <HI>Ane Baaref rabbene;</HI> that is, <HI>What, do I know that there is a God?</HI> or, <HI>I know not what is God.</HI> This cau&s;ed me to wonder, both at the
<HI>Copties</HI> &s;ettled per&s;wa&s;ion of the real Appa|rition of their Saints, and at the ignorance of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> &s;eeing that &s;ome of them know not that there is a God. At la&s;t this Wretch was &s;hut up in a Cage, and I know not what happen'd to him afterwards.</P>
<P>It is time to prepare to depart when the Com|pany withdraws it &s;elf; and if one de&s;ires to re|turn to <HI>Cairo</HI> by another way, one may go by Land to <HI>Brullos,</HI> from thence to <HI>Ro&s;etta;</HI> by this means one may go through the lower part of <HI>Delta:</HI> a curious Journy which I never heard that any <HI>Franc</HI> hath made. But in ca&s;e any danger is likely to be in this way, one may go from <HI>Gemiane</HI> to Great
<HI>Mohelle,</HI> where the ways are full of Peo|ple; and from thence one may go by Land to <HI>Cairo,</HI> and &s;ee all the Antiquities that be in
<HI>Mo|helle</HI> and all along the wav.</P>
<P>I went away on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning when eve|ry one was departing, and returned to <HI>Cairo</HI> the &s;ame way that I came, becau&s;e the other ways &s;eem'd to be dangerous. I arrived at <HI>Cairo</HI> the
<PB N="102" REF="55">20th of the &s;ame Month, eleven days after my departure.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entation of this Church is in the Cabinet of Mon&s;ieur <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>May</HI> I went to vi&s;it the Patri|arch of the <HI>Copties,</HI> called <HI>Muallim Mattaos,</HI> or Ma&s;ter
<HI>Matthew,</HI> whom I had &s;een in my fir&s;t Voy|age. I intreated him to give me a Letter to re|commend me to the Mona&s;teries of Saint
<HI>Macari|us,</HI> whither I intended to go, which he granted me very willingly.</P>
<P>The 30th of this Month a <HI>Bey</HI> of
<HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> arrived at <HI>Cairo,</HI> bound for the I&s;land of
<HI>Suaquen,</HI> &s;cituated in the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> where he was to Govern as <HI>Pacha.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time came <HI>Don Pietro,</HI> an
<HI>Aby&s;&s;in,</HI> whom I had known at <HI>Rome,</HI> and who had given me the Manu&s;cripts of the Synods, and the Old Te&s;tament written in the
<HI>Ethiopian</HI> Language. He, and another of the &s;ame Nation named
<HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> went with this <HI>Pacha,</HI> with an in|tention to get into their own Country. I heard &s;ome time after that this <HI>Pietro</HI> was become a <HI>Mahometan</HI> at <HI>Sues,</HI> to e&s;cape the Fire unto which he was condemn'd for &s;triking a
<HI>Moor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Voyage to <HI>Ro&s;etta.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> I went out of
<HI>Cairo</HI> de&s;igned for <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> with the &s;ame
<HI>Leonard</HI> who had been with me at <HI>Gemiane,</HI> and a
<HI>Nubian</HI> Slave that I had. I went thither on pur|po&s;e to &s;pend there the time of the violent heats, which are not &s;o fierce in that City as at
<HI>Cairo;</HI> <PB N="103" REF="55">as al&s;o to &s;ee the Mouth of the River
<HI>Nilus</HI> at that City, and to &s;atisfie a doubt that I had about the Water, of <HI>Maad&iacute;e;</HI> for I knew not whether it was a Gulph, or a Mouth of the River <HI>Nilus:</HI> with an intention from thence to go to
<HI>Alexan|dria</HI> to &s;ee its Curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>We were four days going from <HI>Cairo</HI> to
<HI>Ro&s;etta;</HI> an extraordinary long time, becau&s;e the winds
<HI>Maltam,</HI> or <HI>Mae&s;traux,</HI> that blow again&s;t tho&s;e that go down the River, oppo&s;ed our Voyage.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Towns in this way are, <HI>Fuva, Sindiun, Teirut, Motubis,</HI> and <HI>Tf&eacute;ni,</HI> by the River &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Fuva,</HI> called by the <HI>Greeks Metelis,</HI> and in the
<HI>Copties</HI> Dictionary <HI>Me&s;&s;il,</HI> is a very ancient, great, and con&s;iderable Town, &s;cituated upon the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of
<HI>Nilus,</HI> &s;even hours travelling from <HI>Re|&s;etta.</HI> Its Territory is very delightful, becau&s;e of the plea&s;ant Fields and Gardens round about. It bears Fruits that are much e&s;teem'd in all
<HI>E|gypt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Geziret Iddahab,</HI> or <HI>the I&s;land of Gold,</HI> is over again&s;t this City.</P>
<P>Heretofore the River was &s;o deep from the Mouth as far as this Town, that great Barques loaden were able to &s;ail hither; at that time the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e was kept here. But in time the River becoming here &s;o &s;hallow that the Barques being not able to come &s;o far, the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e hath been &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> where it con|tinues yet.</P>
<P><HI>Sindiun</HI> and <HI>Teirut</HI> are two other Towns &s;citu|ated upon the Banks of <HI>Nilus</HI> over again&s;t one a|nother; as are al&s;o <HI>Mot&uacute;bis</HI> and <HI>Tf&eacute;ni:</HI> the fir&s;t &s;tands on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, the other on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="56">
<P>At <HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> I lodged with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Reynaud,</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul of the <HI>French</HI> in this City; he is a very hone&s;t Man: He imployed all his credit to procure me the &s;ight of the Curio&s;ities round a|bout.</P>
<P>For the information of all <HI>European</HI> Travel|lers, I have taken notice that of late there is a Carrier &s;et up at <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> who goes by Land to <HI>Damietta,</HI> when any de&s;ires to travel that way, which conveniency was not formerly; for when any intended that Journey, he was to run many hazards and inconveniences. I had fir&s;t de&s;ign'd to go thither, but in&s;tead of that Journey I went to vi&s;it the Mona&s;teries of the De&s;art of S. <HI>Ma|carius,</HI> where I expected more &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I have long doubted whether the Waters of
<HI>Maad&iacute;e,</HI> or the Pool, that is half-way between
<HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> and <HI>Alexandria</HI> was a Branch of <HI>Nilus,</HI> or el&s;e a Gulph of the Sea. In another Relation of <HI>Egypt</HI> which I Printed in <HI>Italian</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Year 1671. I have &s;aid that it was a Branch of <HI>Nilus;</HI> but &s;ince I have under&s;tood the truth that it was nothing but a Gulph, or Pool: for, 1. Its Waters are very &s;alt as far as <HI>Etku,</HI> its uttermo&s;t bounds; which Town, as I conceive, is the &s;ame with <HI>Motubis.</HI> 2. This Water comes not from
<HI>Nilus,</HI> neither hath any Corre&s;pondency with this River. True it is, when <HI>Nilus</HI> overflows it be|comes &s;weeter, becau&s;e of the mixture of the Ri|ver's-water with the Water of this Gulph. It re|tains this &s;weetne&s;s about two Months, until <HI>Ni|lus</HI> leaves the Fields; and as &s;oon as the <HI>Tramon|tane,</HI> or <HI>We&s;terly</HI> Wind blows, the Waters of this Pool return to their wonted &s;altne&s;s and acri|mony.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="56">
<P>The 10th of <HI>June</HI> I went to the Mouth of the River
<HI>Nilus,</HI> about an hours &s;ailing from <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> to take the De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>I took notice that <HI>Nilus</HI> hath there two Bran|ches, or Mouths, though they be reckoned but one. That which runs into the Sea towards the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and is called the <HI>Ea&s;terly Mouth;</HI> and that which runs into the Sea towards the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and is named the
<HI>We&s;terly Mouth.</HI> They take the fir&s;t to &s;ail to <HI>Brullos,</HI> to <HI>Damietta,</HI> to <HI>Seyda,</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tantinople, &amp;c</HI> and by this la&s;t they go to <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> and other

<P>The Mouth of <HI>Nilus</HI> next to this City, is Guard|ed with two Ca&s;tles; one &s;tands at the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of the River, and the other at the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> That which is about a Mile and a half from
<HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> is &s;quare, encompa&s;&s;ed about with &s;trong Walls, built according to the old Model, having four Towers. In the middle is a high Dungeon to re|treat at la&s;t. One hundred four&s;core and four
<HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> are there in Gari&s;on. They lye every Night in the Gari&s;on, but in the Day-time they have liberty to go into the City to work for their living. It is furni&s;h'd with three&s;core and four|teen Pieces of Cannon, &s;even are of an extraordi|nary bigne&s;s. The <HI>Aga</HI> that Commanded here in chief, was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegado.</P>
<P>The other Ca&s;tle is but a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> before it &s;tands &s;even Pieces of Artillery on the Ground: Here Commands al&s;o an

<HI>Jani&s;&s;ary</HI> that was with me, and well acquainted with them, offered to an&s;wer for me. They treated me in this manner, for fear of a Pirat of
<HI>Malta</HI> that &s;ailed before the Ha|ven at that time; they were afraid that I had &s;ome intelligence with him, to give him notice of &s;ome Ships that were ready to &s;et &s;ail loaden from <HI>Ro&s;etta:</HI> Neverthele&s;s I had another opportunity to take the De&s;cription of this Mouth al&s;o.

<HEAD>A Journy by Land from <HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> to
<HI>Alex|andria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE 14th of <HI>June</HI> I went, in the Evening, from
<HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> towards <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with a <HI>Moor</HI> recommended to me by the <HI>French</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul of this City: We had two Mules to car|ry us, for which I paid &s;eventeen <HI>Meidins</HI> for the whole Journy.</P>
<P>About Midnight we came to the Water, named by the <HI>Moors Maad&iacute;e.</HI> After a little &s;tay in the <HI>Han,</HI> or publick Inn, we proceeded on in our Journey in a Moon-&s;hining Night towards
<HI>Alex|andria;</HI> where we arriv'd the next day about eight or nine a Clock. From <HI>Ro&s;etta</HI> to <HI>Alexan|dria</HI> there is ten hours travelling for a Hor&s;e|man; the mo&s;t part of the way is along the Sea-Coa&s;t, &s;o that the Bea&s;ts have a long way their Feet in Water.</P>
<P>The Country is &s;o even, that there is no trou|ble for Travellers; and unle&s;s it be the <HI>Han,</HI> <PB N="107" REF="57">in the Mid-way, there is neither Village, nor Tree, nor Gra&s;s to be &s;een: It is nothing but a plain Champain of Sand, altogether unfruitful.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Franc</HI> is bound to pay, at the entrance into
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> at the Gate of <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> three <HI>Para's;</HI> half to the <HI>Beduins,</HI> or <HI>Boemiens,</HI> and half to the
<HI>Jani&s;&s;aries,</HI> becau&s;e they are there up|on the Guard.</P>
<P>At my fir&s;t arrival at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> on the 15th of the &s;ame Month, I went to &s;alute Mon&s;ieur <HI>Laurens,</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul in this City for the <HI>French;</HI> who expre&s;t a great deal of civility to me, and offered me his Table and a Chamber in his Hou&s;e; but in regard I was recommended by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Brou&s;&s;on,</HI> the Factor of the
<HI>Levant</HI> Company, to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sabatery,</HI> his intimate Friend, and Factor there, and in regard he had a convenient Lodg|ing which he offer'd me, to content them both I lodg'd with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sabatery,</HI> and made u&s;e of the Vice-Con&s;ul's Table all the time I &s;taid at
<HI>A|lexandria.</HI></P>
<P>I went next to vi&s;it an intimate Friend, with whom I had an acquaintance in my fir&s;t Voyage to <HI>Egypt;</HI> he was called <HI>Komos Jean,</HI> Arch-Prie&s;t of the Church of S. <HI>Mark</HI> of the
<HI>Copties:</HI> He is an under&s;tanding, and an hone&s;t Man, and hath informed me much concerning the affairs of <HI>E|gypt.</HI></P>
<P>I under&s;tood from the <HI>French</HI> Merchants of this City, that their <HI>Fondego</HI> hath been built by the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s order for their Lodging; and &s;ince their e&s;tabli&s;hment in this City the
<HI>Turk|i&s;h Emperours</HI> were wont to pay to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;uls ever Year two hundred Crowns for the Reparations of this Hou&s;e, but of late they don't <PB N="108" REF="58">&s;ee this Money: The cau&s;e is not well known.</P>
<P>On the 16th of this Month I went to a <HI>Jews</HI> Hou&s;e, with an intention to buy of him a curious Hieroglyphick Stone that &s;tands at the Thre&s;hold of his Door. It is about an Ell and a-half long, and about a Foot broad, of a Marble colour; upon which are graven three lines of Hiero|glyphick Letters in very &s;mall Characters, which are to be read from the left hand to the right.</P>
<P>This Stone was de&s;ired by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot,</HI> who endeavoured to buy it; he offered, as I was told, thirty <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> to this <HI>Jew</HI> for it; but the other ask'd an hundred.</P>
<P>All the People of the <HI>Levant</HI> have this fooli&s;h Cu&s;tome to rai&s;e the Price of their Commodi|ties; when they &s;ee that a
<HI>Franc</HI> de&s;ires any thing, though it were but a trifle, the others de&s;ire makes them think it to be unvaluable; they prize it therefore at &s;uch a rate that none dare meddle with it: They are &s;o &s;imple to &s;uffer the Commo|dity to lie upon their Hands and &s;poil, rather than to &s;ell it to a <HI>Franc</HI> at the &s;ame rate that they would give it to a Man of the
<HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I expected that the <HI>Jew</HI> had chang'd his mind &s;ince that time; I offer'd him the &s;ame Price that this <HI>Franc</HI> had offer'd before: but when I &s;aw that my offer render'd him more proud, re&s;olved in his fir&s;t demand, I never trou|bled him afterwards.</P>
<P>The Lodgings of the &s;eventy Interpreters, who Tran&s;lated the
<HI>Hebrew</HI> Bible into <HI>Greek,</HI> are yet &s;tanding in this City, almo&s;t entire, with the Clo&s;ets where they performed their Work. The
<HI>Turks</HI> have made a <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> there, which they name
<PB N="109" REF="58"><HI>Giama il garb&iacute;e,</HI> or the <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of the <HI>Levant.</HI> It is to be &s;een with Money: Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Brue,</HI> chief In|terpreter of the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul of
<HI>Cairo,</HI> hath gone in.</P>
<P>The 19th of <HI>June,</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI> I went to &s;ee the Salt-pits of the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> which are out of the City near the <HI>Calitz</HI> or <HI>Channel</HI> of <HI>Cleo|patra,</HI> from whence they have their Fre&s;h-water when the River runs over the Banks, and near the Garden of a <HI>Moor</HI> often vi&s;ited by the <HI>French</HI> Mer|chants, which is call'd <HI>Gheit il chavagie,</HI> or <HI>the Merchants Garden.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e Salt-pits I have taken notice of two things very remarkable: Fir&s;t, that the Water of <HI>Nilus,</HI> the &s;weete&s;t Water and the fre&s;he&s;t in the World, makes a Salt, not only whiter than ordi|nary, but very excellent. Secondly, that this Salt hath the ta&s;te of Violets.</P>
<P>They that have the care of tho&s;e Salt-pits cau&s;e a certain quantity of the River-water to run into the Salt-pits; and &s;our or five days after the Water is turn'd into a Salt the mo&s;t beautiful to the Eye, afterwards they carry it in Baskets to dry in the Sun; then it is fit to be &s;old.</P>
<P>Salt is al&s;o to be made of the Lake <HI>Sebaka,</HI> na|med by the ancient <HI>Latins, Palus Mareotis,</HI> which is at the
<HI>South</HI>-&s;ide of this City; but its Water is naturally &s;alt, and its Salt is bitter when it is made, therefore they neglect it.</P>
<P>This Lake proceeds from the River <HI>Nilus</HI> when it overflows; the Waters there continue, becau&s;e they have no pa&s;&s;age out. It is not very deep, but &s;o large that from one &s;ide one cannot well &s;ee the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> have in their Church <PB N="110" REF="59">of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> a Picture of the Arch-Angel S.
<HI>Mi|chael,</HI> drawn by S. <HI>Luke,</HI> as report goes.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luca&s;ole,</HI> Chancellor of the
<HI>French</HI> Nation in this City, told me that the <HI>Venetians</HI> had carried away this Picture &s;ome time-&s;ince, and &s;ail'd with it five times out of the Haven, but could not proceed on in their Voyage, becau&s;e they were &s;topt by an invi&s;ible Hand every time that they intended to &s;ail away, and could never depart till they had carried back the Picture.</P>
<P>The report of this Wonder being &s;pread a|broad in the City; the <HI>Beduins,</HI> or <HI>Boemiens</HI> as we call them, took a re&s;olution &s;ecretly to &s;teal it away and &s;ell it to the <HI>Francs:</HI> Accordingly, when they had broken open the Doors of the Church and pulled it down from the place where it &s;tood, they could not po&s;&s;ibly get out with it; &s;o that they were al&s;o forc'd to put it up again in its place as the
<HI>Venetians</HI> had done before, where it remains &s;till, I have &s;een it.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luca&s;ole</HI> told me that this is very true, and that he him&s;elf was then at <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>I have read &s;omething concerning the Waters of the Ci&s;terns of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in the Book of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Ch.</HI> that treats of the overflowing of the River <HI>Nilus:</HI> That they become &s;alt about the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> and that in the Night that the fruitful Dew falls they return to their former &s;weetne&s;s, and increa&s;e be&s;ides with the Waters of the River.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not offer to deny flatly a thing that may be true, and which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Burattini,</HI> cited by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Ch.</HI> &s;aith hath been ob&s;erv'd by &s;everal Per&s;ons: But I dare &s;ay that in two &s;everal Voyages into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and during my long abode
<PB N="111" REF="59">at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons of the Year; though I have ob&s;erv'd, as exactly as I could, all things, I never heard that the Waters of the&s;e Ci&s;terns did become &s;alt, or that they did in|crea&s;e with the Waters of the River, or that they did recover their former fre&s;hne&s;s and &s;weet|ne&s;s: I have neverthele&s;s wondred a little to ta&s;te them &s;omewhat &s;alt, &s;o that they &s;eem not to come from &s;o fre&s;h a River.</P>
<P>This quality proceeds from the nitrous Earth, which may be known by this Experiment; if a piece of Earth about <HI>Alexandria</HI> be put in the hot Sun, it will become white as Snow on that &s;ide that is towards the Sun.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI> and of the Caves that are near <HI>Alexandria,</HI> not far from it.</HEAD>
<P>THE 21&s;t of <HI>June</HI> I went to &s;ee the Pillar of
<HI>Pompey,</HI> and other Rarities thereabouts, in the company of Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Truillard,</HI> the Elder, a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, and of the
<HI>Jani&s;&s;ary</HI> that belongs to the Vice-Con&s;ul. We went out at the Gate called <HI>Babi&s;&s;idr,</HI> where this Pillar &s;tands upon a little Hill towards the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>When I drew near, I took notice that it lean'd on one &s;ide; whereas eight years before it &s;tood very &s;treight, when I &s;aw it. The cau&s;e of this are the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who out of a per&s;wa&s;ion of &s;ome great Trea&s;ure hid under, have digg'd and under|min'd it, and have drawn out of its Foundation ma|ny great heaps of Stones that held it up; this cau&s;|eth it to lean a little on that &s;ide. They had over|thrown it, had they not found at the bottom <PB N="102" REF="60">Stones of a fearful bigne&s;s, and &s;o great that neither they nor any body el&s;e was able to draw them out.</P>
<P>The De&s;cription and Dimen&s;ions of this Pil|lar are found in the Book of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot:</HI> Therefore I &s;ay no more of it here, becau&s;e I will not &s;tuff this Book with ordinary things, menti|oned before in other Travels.</P>
<P>After we had well viewed this Pillar, we march'd along the
<HI>Calitz,</HI> as far as the place that is over again&s;t the City Walls, to ob&s;erve the Pa&s;&s;age of the Waters. We went with this de|&s;ign on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Calitz,</HI> over the lit|tle Bridge that is near it: When we came to the little Arches that are under the Walls, through which the River enters into the City, we made our ob&s;ervations, and took next the way that leads to the Caves that are in the Fields at <HI>We&s;t-South-We&s;t</HI> of the Gate out of which we came; and about a quarter of a League, in our way to|wards the Lake <HI>Sebaca,</HI> we came to the Caves; having left at
<HI>We&s;t-North-We&s;t</HI> a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> in a plain Field, where was buried a certain <HI>Schech</HI> of the <HI>Moors,</HI> called <HI>Sidi gams il g&aacute;bbari.</HI></P>
<P>At our entrance we went down a dozen &s;teps into a very large Alley, digg'd in the Rock, but open a-top; it may be the Vault is fallen by length of time. In this Alley are fifteen great holes cut in the Rock, in the fa&s;hion of great Gates; &s;even are on the right hand, and eight on the left; through which Men enter into the Caves.</P>
<P>We went into four with our Torches lighted, our
<HI>Jani&s;&s;ary</HI> before us; we found round about the Walls, in the firm Rock, from the top to the <PB N="113" REF="60">bottom, holes cut in the Rock very orderly; and of a length and breadth fit to hold a Coffin: Many of the&s;e Caves were cut, to open a way to others. This inconveniency we found there, they were almo&s;t all fill'd up with Earth and Sand, which cau&s;ed us to kneel for the mo&s;t part: this did not hinder us from taking notice of that which was mo&s;t remarkable. Whiles we were in one, at the end of the Alley, one of our Company per|ceived, with the light of his Tapers, that one of the holes open'd a pa&s;&s;age to another Cave; which cau&s;ed us to &s;ee whether there was not there any thing worthy of our notice: Though the hole was but &s;mall and narrow, we crept in upon our Bellies with our lighted Tapers; and one after another we came to the other &s;ide, where we &s;ound one of the &s;trange&s;t and mo&s;t curious Caves that we had ever &s;een: It was greater, more compleat, and cleaner than any of the o|thers; built long and &s;quare, and well Plai&s;ter'd with Lime; at each &s;ide of the Wall, which is the main Rock, there are three ranks of holes, like to tho&s;e that we had &s;een in the former: In the longer &s;ides were fifteen in every rank, plac'd one a top of the other; in all they were forty-five. The two ends, or &s;ides, that were &s;horte&s;t, had likewi&s;e three ranks, and three holes at e|very rank, nine in all. They were all empty and clean, and no ill &s;cent in all the Cave; un|le&s;s it be in one hole, where we &s;aw the Skeleton of the Body of a Man dried up.</P>
<P>I conceive that the Learned may de&s;ire my judgment concerning the&s;e Caves and Holes, and to what purpo&s;e they were made. To this I an|&s;wer, that it is not ea&s;ie to give a ju&s;t account of
<PB N="114" REF="61">them; becau&s;e <HI>Macrizi,</HI> who hath &s;poken of all the remarkable things of <HI>Egypt,</HI> makes no men|tion of the&s;e Caves: Neverthele&s;s it is ea&s;ie to be &s;een, that they could be for no other u&s;e, but to bury and place the dead. This may be gathered from the fa&s;hion of the holes, which are ju&s;t as long as high, and as large as needs mu&s;t to place a Bier or Coffin; be&s;ides, all the other Caves in <HI>Egypt</HI> were only for that purpo&s;e: it is therefore very probable that this was for no other purpo&s;e, let the Reader think what he plea&s;eth of them.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that they may have &s;erv'd the Chri&s;tians to meet together, and pray God in &s;e|cret, for fear of the Heathens that per&s;ecuted them. I find this Opinion in <HI>Seid ibn Patrik,</HI> a Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory, <HI>p.</HI> 399.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Alexandria</HI> name the&s;e Caves the
<HI>S&uacute;k,</HI> or the Market-place; but there is no likelihood that they have been employed for that u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rock in which they are cut, is much eaten and con&s;um'd by time; the holes are likewi&s;e much decayed, chiefly tho&s;e that are neare&s;t to the Door, and in the open air: They receive &s;ome light from above, through little &s;quare holes that are made on purpo&s;e in the Vaults.</P>
<P>The 22th I went round the City, to take no|tice of the Walls and Towers. I went into &s;ix of the chief: The fir&s;t is that which is neare&s;t to the <HI>French Fondego,</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Hou&s;e, before you come to
<HI>Bab il achdar,</HI> or <HI>the green Gate.</HI> It is round, and &s;upported within with three ranks of Pillars of red Stone, &s;even in every one.</P>
<P>Next to this Tower, we went to the Gate of the old Haven, which at pre&s;ent is walled in, be|cau&s;e <PB N="115" REF="61">this Haven is not frequented: both are at the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of the City. From this Gate we went to the <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of the &s;eventy, called <HI>Giama il garbis.</HI> We went next by the old Ca&s;tle of <HI>A|lexandria,</HI> named
<HI>Borg Mu&s;tapha Pacha,</HI> which &s;erv'd heretofore to guard the old Haven; at pre&s;ent there are three hundred <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> in Ga|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>Till then we walk'd always towards the <HI>We&s;t;</HI> but when we had left this Ca&s;tle, we turn'd to|wards the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and found next a great Tower; where we got upon the Platform, not by any &s;teps, but by a large way made &s;loping up.</P>
<P>Next to this Tower, we came to <HI>Bab i&s;&s;idr,</HI> out of which &s;tands the Pillar of <HI>Pompey:</HI> From thence we went to another, called <HI>Bab irra&s;c&icirc;d,</HI> or <HI>the Gate of Ro&s;etta,</HI> along the Walls of the City. I went out of the City, alone with the
<HI>Jani&s;&s;ary,</HI> to &s;ee where the River <HI>Nilus</HI> goes into the Channel which an&s;wers to the Ci&s;terns of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which I &s;hall de&s;cribe hereafter.</P>
<P>When I had fully viewed that which I de&s;ired, I returned into the Town to my company, that waited for me in the &s;hade; and all together we walk'd to the Tower of the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e of late there lodges &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Pil|grims. We went into it, and found its make ve|ry admirable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>We went next to the Tower of the old Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e, or
<HI>Douane;</HI> &s;o nam'd, becau&s;e when the Sea came to the Walls: of the City on that &s;ide, the Store-hou&s;es of the Cu&s;toms were there: But &s;ince the Sea is gone from thence, the Gate is &s;hut, and the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is establi&s;h'd and &s;ettled in another place.</P>
<PB N="116" REF="62">
<P>This Tower is very big, &s;upported within with four ranks of Pillars of red Stone. Here are many Rooms fit for &s;tores, for lodgings, and to put Salt in, though much of it is now ruinated. This was the la&s;t Tower that we &s;aw in our Walk, which continued four hours, reckoning the time that we &s;pent in viewing the Walls, and climbing up to the Towers.</P>
<P>I return at pre&s;ent to the Channel, by which the Ci&s;terns are furni&s;h'd with Water.</P>
<P>It is out of the Gate of <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> about &s;ix Foot high, vaulted in the in&s;ide, about a quarter of a Mile from the City: It joins to the <HI>Calitz</HI> of <HI>Cleo|patra,</HI> that furni&s;hes it with Water from the Ri|ver <HI>Nilus;</HI> from thence the Water runs to the Walls, where it meets with another Conduit not fat from this Gate; which Conduit, or Channel, is made &s;o ingeniou&s;ly, that it furni&s;hes all the Ci&s;terns of the City with Water.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o take notice, that though the Mouth of this Channel is as high as the re&s;t, al|mo&s;t the two thirds are wall'd from the top to the bottom; &s;o that there remains but a &s;mall hole where the Waters of the <HI>Calitz</HI> flow in, as through a Window. And becau&s;e they are very &s;alt the fir&s;t three days, and they would fill the Ci&s;terns with &s;lime and filth, if the Water did enter in at that time freely: To prevent this in|conveniency, they that have the care of the Wa|ter &s;top this hole, and leave it &s;o three days; which being ended, they go to the entry of the Channel, followed by a crowd of People, to un|&s;top the hole, and let in the Water to fill the Ci&s;terns. This day is a day of great rejoicing all over the City.</P>
<PB N="117" REF="62">
<P>The City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> hath &s;ix Gates; three are open, namely that towards the <HI>South,</HI> called <HI>Bab i&s;&s;idr;</HI> that which is at the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> named <HI>Bab irra&s;c&icirc;d,</HI> or
<HI>the Gate of Ro&s;etta;</HI> that which looks to the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> and is named the Sea-Gate. The three Gates that are &s;hut are, that of the old Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; the green Gate, called by the <HI>Arabs, Bab il achdar;</HI> and that of the old Ha|ven.</P>
<P>I cannot po&s;itively affirm whether the Walls and the Gates that are now there, be tho&s;e that <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> caus'd to be builded, or whe|ther the <HI>Califfs</HI> have made them. I imagin that the
<HI>Califfs</HI> have erected them, and not <HI>Alexan|der;</HI> (though many Travellers are of a contrary opinion.) Becau&s;e there is no <HI>Greek</HI> In&s;criptions to be &s;een, but all <HI>Arab..</HI> Some are written in &s;trange Characters, others in the ordinary <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Character. The&s;e In&s;criptions &s;peak of the <HI>Califf,</HI> and Year when they were builded, or re-edified. The Gates being high where the&s;e In&s;criptions were graven, and the Letters arti|ficially put with other works, I could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h nor read them. 2. The manner of their building proves this truth; for they are builded as the Gates of <HI>Cairo,</HI> which were the work of the <HI>Califfs,</HI> who have been there many Ages after <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Havens in <HI>Alexandria;</HI> the one called the old Haven, where Ships enter in with the <HI>We&s;terly</HI> Wind; but now it is of no u&s;e, but to &s;ecure the Ve&s;&s;els that &s;ail from the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> towards the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> when the bad Weather obliges them to &s;eek for &s;helter. The other is called the new Haven; there all the Ships arrive, <PB N="118" REF="63">and where they now ca&s;t Anchor.</P>
<P>The Trade of the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in this City, is the greate&s;t that they have in all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts; for there is no place in <HI>Turkie</HI> where &s;o many <HI>French</HI> Ships come as into this Ha|ven; from the beginning of the Year 1672, to the Month of
<HI>June,</HI> there was no le&s;s than nine|teen <HI>French</HI> Ships that came hither; and in the Month of <HI>June</HI> I reckoned fourteen.</P>
<P>This is a con&s;iderable number, but not to be compar'd with the number of Ve&s;&s;els that fre|quented this Haven heretofore: For Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Luca&s;ole,</HI> that did the Office of Chancellor of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, told me that he remembers that there have been at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in one Year, ninety-four <HI>French</HI> Ships.</P>

<HEAD>A Voyage to the Mona&s;teries of the De&s;arts of S.
<HI>Macarius.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 30th of <HI>June</HI> I went from <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> with an intention to vi&s;it the four Mona|&s;teries of the De&s;arts of S.
<HI>Macarius:</HI> for that purpo&s;e I went aboard of a Boat of a
<HI>Jani&s;&s;ary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">amed
<HI>Reus Ahmed il Curdi,</HI> a Man very well ac|quainted with the
<HI>Francs,</HI> to go with him to <PB N="130" REF="69"><HI>Tarane,</HI> or
<HI>Terenut,</HI> as the <HI>Copties</HI> call it in their Dictionary. It is a little Village in the <HI>Ca&s;cieflik</HI> of <HI>Beheire,</HI> four and twenty hours travelling from <HI>Cairo,</HI> &s;cituate upon the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nilus,</HI> the place where Men commonly go a-&s;hore when they de|&s;ign to travel to tho&s;e Mona&s;teries. But, before I came to that Village, I received many affronts from &s;ome young <HI>Turks,</HI> becau&s;e I carried with me a little Box full of Wine. A zealous <HI>Cadi</HI> being troubled in Con&s;cience for being in the company of a <HI>Franc</HI> that drunk Wine, encou|rag'd them to ask me &s;ome, that he might have an occa&s;ion to quarrel with me, if I did give them &s;ome. The&s;e Rogues having the Authority of a <HI>Cadi</HI> to countenance their wicked de&s;ign, four of the bolde&s;t ask'd me &s;ome very earne&s;tly; for they &s;aid they knew that I had &s;ome. I excus'd my &s;elf at fir&s;t, that I could not give them any to drink, becau&s;e they were not to drink Wine; and that I knew very well that it was a great Crime for a <HI>Franc</HI> to give Wine to a <HI>Mu&s;ulman,</HI> chiefly in a place where many others would be offended at it, and that &s;uch an action might bring me into trouble. But all the&s;e rea&s;ons could not prevail; they would have &s;ome <HI>Volens Nolens,</HI> threatning that if I denied them they would ca&s;t my Wine in|to the River. When I &s;aw my &s;elf in this danger, I intreated the <HI>Reus,</HI> unto whom I was well re|commended by the Vice-Con&s;ul of <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> to de|fend me. He did &s;o much by his credit, that he pacified them for that time.</P>
<P>At my arrival at <HI>Tarane,</HI> whither I was to go a-&s;hore, I hired in the Morning a little Boat to carry me, and my Cloaths and Provi&s;ions, to the Village; for our Ve&s;&s;el was great and well loaden,
<PB N="131" REF="69">and could not at that time go near the &s;hore, be|cau&s;e the Water was not deep. Three of the&s;e <HI>Turks</HI> ca&s;t them&s;elves furiou&s;ly into my Boat, ta|king my Box in earne&s;t to ca&s;t it into the River. I &s;natch'd it from them, and run to my Mu&s;quet as if I intended to &s;hoot at them: my <HI>Black-a-moor</HI> likewi&s;e, who was couragious, took one by the Neck and ca&s;t him into the River, and with his Sword in his Hand put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence; When they &s;aw that they had to do with Men of courage that were not afraid of them, they went back into the Barque, and very furi|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Reus</HI> with their Fi&s;ts; be&s;ides, they accus'd him, as he him&s;elf told me after|wards, at his return to <HI>Cairo,</HI> before his <HI>Aga,</HI> to have drank Wine with a <HI>Franc,</HI> making him pay, as a puni&s;hment, ten
<HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>After this Rencounter, I had another Accident that happen'd to me, far more grievous and dan|gerous. At my landing I wanted a Man to carry my Cloaths to the Hou&s;e where I intended to lodge; I called therefore &s;ome of the <HI>Arabians</HI> that were newly arriv'd from the De&s;arts of S.
<HI>Macarius</HI> with <HI>Nitre,</HI> or <HI>Salt-Peter:</HI> He that car|ried my Box of Wine finding it to be very hea|vy, and knowing not what was in it, he thought it had been a Box of Money; therefore being proud of his burden, he told all that he met with in the way, that he carry'd a Box full of Money, that belong'd to a <HI>Franc</HI> newly arriv'd, that was going to the Mona&s;teries. This lye &s;pread about the Vil|lage, and was believ'd as true, &s;o that I was in no &s;mall danger; for there was no other talk in the Town but of the rich <HI>Franc</HI> that was there, and of the means to get his Money: They thought I had <PB N="132" REF="70">been &s;ome Con&s;ul that travell'd <HI>incognito</HI> to &s;ee the Country, therefore they re&s;olv'd to wait for me in the way, and to take from me all my Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In this manner I landed at <HI>Tarane,</HI> on a
<HI>Sunday,</HI> and went to lodge at a poor Carpenters Hou&s;e, a Chri&s;tian
<HI>Coptie,</HI> the only Chri&s;tian in that Vil|lage; he allowed me for my Chamber, a place where he put Straw for his Bea&s;ts; it was cover|ed with the Faggots of Palm-trees, heap'd one upon another, to hinder the heats of the Sun: I found there two religious Per&s;ons of the Mona|&s;teries whither I intended to go, with them I pa&s;t my fears and apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>When I under&s;tood, from all hands, the Con|&s;piracy that the
<HI>Arabians</HI> had form'd again&s;t me; the danger oblig'd me the the next day, to de&s;ire the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of that place to give me a Guard, to bring me &s;afe to the Mona&s;teries; and that I might per&s;wade him the &s;ooner, I gave him &s;ome Pounds of Coffee and Loaves of Sugar, which I had brought with me for that purpo&s;e; for it is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Turkie,</HI> when a favour is de&s;ired from a <HI>Turk,</HI> to begin with Gifts: But the
<HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> having heard what report went of me, an&s;wer'd me, that a &s;mall Guard would do me but little good, becau&s;e the <HI>Arabians</HI> had formed a de&s;ign to wait for me in the way, and to cut my Throat, and that it was needful that he &s;hould Guard me him&s;elf; which he promis'd to do within a few days, after that he had fini&s;h'd &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance.</P>
<P>I was mightily troubled when I heard what the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> offer'd me. It was to no purpo&s;e when I told him that I was no Con&s;ul, as the report went of me without any colour of truth, but rather a
<PB N="133" REF="70">poor <HI>Franc</HI> that went to the Mona&s;teries to per|fect my &s;elf in the Language of the Country; That in this Box there was no Money, but only &s;ome Gla&s;s Bottles of Wine which I carried with me, becau&s;e I was never us'd to drink Water. All this di&s;|cour&s;e was to no purpo&s;e, he was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the fal&s;e report that I could not be believ'd. When I &s;aw that I &s;pent my labour in vain, I went to my Lodging without accepting his offer.</P>
<P>At that time I had news that <HI>Na&s;&s;r All&aacute;,</HI> an Ab|bot of one of the Mona&s;teries, that I intended to vi&s;it, was at a Village at the other &s;ide of the Ri|ver, call'd <HI>Tuh ine&s;&s;&aacute;ra,</HI> not far from <HI>Tarane</HI> down the Current, about &s;ome concerns of his Mona|&s;tery. I &s;ent him a Letter, written in
<HI>Arabic,</HI> by one of the Lay Monks whom I found at my arri|val at
<HI>Tarane,</HI> acquainting him with my intention, and all that had happen'd between me and the <HI>Ca&s;cief,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> intreating him to tell me how I &s;hould get free from tho&s;e People; I a&s;|&s;ur'd him that I &s;hould be for ever oblig'd to him, and that all the favour he &s;hould &s;hew me would be plea&s;ing to his Partriarch, who was my very good Friend, and had recommended me to the Governours of tho&s;e Mona&s;teries. But this un|civil Abbot was &s;o far from an&s;wering to my Let|ter, as I expected, that he kept with him the Me&s;&s;enger, and would not &s;uffer him to return back.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw the Abbots incivility, and being more de&s;irous to proceed on in my Journy, not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e difficulties; I re&s;olved once more to vi&s;it the <HI>Ca&s;cief,</HI> to intreat him to give me a Guard, thinking to find him of another judg|ment than he was before when I &s;aw him fir&s;t, but <PB N="134" REF="71">I receiv'd from him the &s;ame an&s;wer; He told me that he would not have me venture, unle&s;s he Guarded me him&s;elf; that he mu&s;t an&s;wer to the <HI>Pacha</HI> for my Life, if any mi&s;chance did happen to me in my Journy, and that he knew that I was but ill accommodated with the Chri&s;tian; he de&s;ired me therefore to take a Chamber at his Hou&s;e. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this &s;econd offer, as well as the fir&s;t, did &s;trangely trouble me: for this earne&s;t de&s;ire that he did di&s;cover of Guarding me in his own Per&s;on, was no good Omen to me; be|&s;ides, his Reputation was but bad in the Village; and when I &s;hould have had no rea&s;on to fear him, and that his intentions had been very good, the expences I mu&s;t have been at for him and his Company, and the Gifts that I mu&s;t have be&s;tow|ed upon him for his pains, would have ruined me; for I knew that a <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> never ventures out in a Journy without a great train of Hor&s;e and Foot, and without expecting great matters.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw the danger and trouble that I had in this Journy, I re&s;olved to return to <HI>Cairo</HI> as &s;oon as I could. With this re&s;olution I &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in my Lodging, thinking how I might be able to compa&s;s it. About two hours in the Night I heard knocking at the Door very earne&s;t|ly, and becau&s;e it was no &s;ea&s;onable time to &s;peak with me, and that the Per&s;on knockt very hard, I began to think that I was in danger: That I might not be &s;urpriz'd, I awak'd the Per&s;ons in the Hou&s;e, and took my Weapons in my hand, &s;ending my <HI>Black-a-moor</HI> to &s;ee who was there; he return'd to me, and told me that it was a Groom of the
<HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> that was de&s;irous to &s;peak with me, concerning a bu&s;ine&s;s of the highe&s;t im|portance. <PB N="135" REF="71">I caus'd him to come in, and found that it was he that had introduc'd me to his Ma|&s;ters pre&s;ence, unto whom I had made &s;ome &s;mall Gifts: As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he intreated me by his Religion and mine, as the Cu&s;tom of the Coun|try is, to go away immediately, as &s;ecretly as I could; for his Ma&s;ter intended to kill me, becau&s;e he thought I was a Man that travell'd up and down only to &s;eek for the Trea&s;ures of the an|cient <HI>Egyptians:</HI> And that he might more conve|niently perform this bloody de&s;ign, he was re|&s;olved to lead me him&s;elf towards the Mona&s;te|ries to the middle of the Wilderne&s;s, where he would &s;uffer me to re&s;t, and afterwards cut my Throat: And if afterwards any &s;hould inquire for a <HI>Franc</HI> that was gone by
<HI>Tarane</HI> to the Mona|&s;teries, he would &s;ay that he is gone to
<HI>Cairo</HI> by another way: He told me al&s;o, that about a Month before that, his Ma&s;ter had kill'd a <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> Traveller of
<HI>Barbary,</HI> and had ca&s;t his Body into the River, for the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I under&s;tood this bad news, I had no more mind to &s;leep, I gave him the reward that he had de&s;erv'd, and &s;ent to &s;eek a Camel to car|ry my Cloaths; and about one of the Clock in the Night I departed to go to the pa&s;&s;age that leads to <HI>Giz&eacute;y,</HI> a Village &s;cituated on the other &s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> about an hour and a halfs travel|ling from <HI>Tarane</HI> down the Water: I agreed there with a Ma&s;ter of a Boat to carry me and my Cloaths over; and about break of the Day I went aboard very &s;peedily: As &s;oon as we were lanch'd into the River, from Land, I &s;aw the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> galloping towards us with about thir|ty Men on Hor&s;e back to catch me; but he <PB N="136" REF="72">mi&s;s'd of his intent, for I was out of his reach.</P>
<P>At <HI>Giz&eacute;y,</HI> as I was waiting for an opportunity to return to <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Abbot <HI>Na&s;&s;r alla,</HI> menti|oned before, came thither and offer'd to conduct me to the Mona&s;teries, if I would return to <HI>Ta|rane</HI> in his company; but I had no mind any lon|ger to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>I went from <HI>Giz&eacute;y</HI> the &s;ame day, being
<HI>Fryday,</HI> towards <HI>Cairo;</HI> and the next Night we lodg'd at
<HI>Verdan,</HI> a Village &s;cituate on the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of
<HI>Ni|lus,</HI> not far from <HI>Boulak;</HI> and on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th of <HI>July,</HI> I enter'd into <HI>Cairo,</HI> from whence I de|parted the
7th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at <HI>Tarane,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI>'s Clark, who was a <HI>Coptie</HI> and a Chri&s;tian, came to &s;ee me &s;ometimes. I under&s;tood from him what the Lakes of <HI>Salt-Peter,</HI> or
<HI>Niter,</HI> yield to the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI> every Year. He told me, that this Year within the &s;pace of nine Months, they had drawn four and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Quintals,</HI> and that they mu&s;t take up twelve thou&s;and more to make up the ordinary Sum that is drawn: So that every
<HI>Quintal</HI> being &s;old for 25 <HI>Meidins,</HI> this Revenue comes to 36 Pur&s;es, or 18000 Crowns, <HI>French</HI> Money, by the Year.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it is taken out of the Lakes they car|ry it upon Camels to <HI>Tarane,</HI> where it is weighed, and from thence &s;ent to
<HI>Cairo,</HI> or <HI>Alexandria,</HI> to be &s;old.</P>
<P>For this cau&s;e a <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> dwells here, who though he be but little in Authority, and &s;ubject to the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of
<HI>Beheire,</HI> he is forc'd to buy this em|ployment, and pay for it four and twenty Pur&s;es; one half to the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of <HI>Beheire,</HI> and the other half to the <HI>Pacha:</HI> he keeps al&s;o twenty <HI>Spahins</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="72">to wait upon him, and guard his Country; he is the Lord of the&s;e Mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>But before I proceed on in my Journal, I will give a &s;hort account of &s;ome remarkable things in this De&s;art, as I have heard them from one that hath been an Abbot in one of the Mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t there is to be &s;een, between the Mona&s;te|ries of S.
<HI>Macarius,</HI> and of <HI>Amba Bi&s;cioi,</HI> and a little further in the Wilderne&s;s, a long rank of little heaps of Earth, a Foot from one another, plac'd as in a way; which, as the Monks &s;ay, was put there by the Angels, that the Hermites might be able to find the way to the Church when they were de&s;irous to hear Divine Service on <HI>Sundays;</HI> for before they were apt to go out of the way: Therefore this way is called now, <HI>Tarik il mel&aacute;ike,</HI> or, <HI>The way of Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly I have under&s;tood from an old Manu|&s;cript in
<HI>Arab.</HI> that in the Wilderne&s;s were here|tofore &s;even great Mona&s;teries; namely, 1. of S. <HI>Macarius;</HI> 2. Of S. <HI>John the little,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Igum&egrave;ne;</HI> 3. Of <HI>Amba Bi&s;c&iacute;oi;</HI> 4. Of S. <HI>Ma&s;&s;ine,</HI> and <HI>Timo|thy;</HI> 5. That of <HI>Amba Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Black;</HI> 6. That of <HI>Amba K&eacute;ma;</HI> 7. That of the holy Vir|gin of <HI>Syria:</HI> and that be&s;ides the&s;e &s;even Mona|&s;teries, there were three hundred dwellings of Hermites, and &s;olitary People that &s;erved God in this Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But now, of all the&s;e Mona&s;teries, there are but two remarkable; namely, the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and that of
<HI>Amba Bi&s;cioi.</HI> They are fur|ni&s;h'd with very good Water. The fir&s;t hath two Churches; one for the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and another for the
<HI>Copties.</HI></P>
<P>In that of the <HI>Syrians</HI> is to be &s;een a miraculous
<PB N="138" REF="73">Tree, growing from the Staff of S. <HI>Ephrem.</HI> This holy Man left it at the Gate when he went to vi|&s;it one in the Mona&s;tery, and immediately it &s;hot forth Roots downwards, and Leaves upwards, with Flowers. They &s;ay, that there is no &s;uch Tree to be found in all
<HI>Egypt</HI> be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>John the little,</HI> which now is much decayed, is to be &s;een a Tree that grew likewi&s;e from this Saints Staff miracu|lou&s;ly, when he had fix'd it into the Ground at his Superiors command, and water'd it: There|fore they call it, becau&s;e of this Act of Obedience, <HI>Scieigiaret itt&aacute;a,</HI> or <HI>the Tree of Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, in the way that leads from the Mo|na&s;tery of the
<HI>Syrians</HI> to the Mountain of the Eagles Stones, is to be &s;een the Bed of <HI>Bahr Bel&aacute; me,</HI> or River without Water; which was dried up, as the Monks relate, at the Prayers of the ancient Hermites that dwelt about its Banks; be|cau&s;e they were grievou&s;ly troubled by the Pyrats that &s;ailed upon it, therefore they obtain'd from God this favour.</P>
<P>Fifthly, in this De&s;art is to be &s;een another Cu|rio&s;ity, call'd by the <HI>Arabians, Lahm iggi&uacute;f;</HI> but becau&s;e I could not well under&s;tand what it was, I could de&s;ire that &s;ome other Traveller would en|quire it out, that we may better know what to think of it.</P>

<HEAD>A Walk to the Garden of <HI>Ma-T&aacute;rea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE 12th of <HI>July</HI> I went, in the Company of &s;ome
<HI>French</HI> Merchants, to the Village of <HI>Ma-T&aacute;rea,</HI> &s;cituate on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> about <PB N="139" REF="73">two hours riding on Hor&s;e-back, to vi&s;it the pla|ces which Chri&s;t and his mo&s;t holy Mother have &s;anctified with their abode, and the Garden where the Balm Plants were &s;et formerly.</P>
<P>At the entry into the Court which is before this Garden there is to be &s;een, at the right hand, a &s;mall Oratory of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which one <HI>Ibra|him,</HI> who was <HI>Pacha</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> about thirteen years ago, caus'd to be built out of a hatred of the <HI>Copties,</HI> upon the ruins of a Church which belong'd to them, and where they reverenc'd &s;ome Relicks and &s;teps of our Lord, and of his mo&s;t holy Mo|ther.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pacha</HI> chang'd, as we have &s;aid, this Chap|pel into an Oratory of <HI>Turks,</HI> that no Chri&s;tian might have the liberty to enter in and vi&s;it it. But &s;ince the <HI>Turks</HI> have for&s;aken it one may go in freely without hindrance; therefore it is no longer named an Oratory, but <HI>il M&aacute;kad,</HI> or <HI>the place of re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>M&aacute;kad</HI> is a little Ci&s;tern of Marble of di|vers colours, full of Water, which comes into it by a Channel from the miraculous Well that is near by. The <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay, from Tradition, that the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin was wont to wa&s;h in it the Linen of her divine Son; and that whil&s;t &s;he was employed in working, &s;he laid him in a little hole which is in the Wall of the <HI>M&aacute;kad,</HI> a place where &s;ome reli|gious <HI>Francs</HI> have heretofore &s;aid Ma&s;s, out of de|votion.</P>
<P>However it be, I will not deny a Tradition &s;o ancient; but it is &s;o hard to reconcile all the Cir|cum&s;tances which they bring to prove it, that when I had done all that I could to under&s;tand the truth, I &s;ound &s;uch doubts as did rather <PB N="140" REF="74">contradict, than e&s;tabli&s;h any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Very near this <HI>M&aacute;kad,</HI> or re&s;ting place, is the miraculous Well, very deep. Its Waters are lighter and &s;weeter than the Waters of <HI>Nilus.</HI> This is &s;o well known, that the <HI>Pacha</HI>'s drink of it, and prefer it to the Waters of the River.</P>
<P>The Tradition of the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay, and &s;ome
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Hi&s;torians agree to it, as <HI>Amru ibn il verdi,</HI> that our Saviour hath wa&s;h'd him&s;elf in this Well, and by a Miracle he hath given this &s;weetne&s;s, and extraordinary plea&s;antne&s;s to the&s;e Waters.</P>
<P>Its Sour&s;e, or Spring, is not well known. Some think that it came by a Miracle, others &s;ay that it proceeds from <HI>Nilus</HI> under ground. But I think it impo&s;&s;ible; 1. Becau&s;e of the great di&s;tance between the River and this Well; 2. Becau&s;e when the Waters of <HI>Nilus</HI> are corrupt and thick, the Water of this Well is clear, whereas if it pro|ceeded out of the River, it would be as thick as the Waters of
<HI>Nilus;</HI> 3. becau&s;e the Water of this Well never ri&s;eth, nor falls, as the River doth, but is always equal in height; finally I con|ceive it, from the name given to it, <HI>M&aacute;-Tarea,</HI> which &s;ignifies fre&s;h Water; this &s;ignifies that it hath a particular Sour&s;e, and a quality not com|mon with the Waters of <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> &s;ay, that it proceeds from the Well
<HI>Bir i&s;&s;im&s;im,</HI> which is at <HI>Mecha;</HI> a famous Well, becau&s;e of a pretended Miracle of <HI>Maho|met.</HI> But this is a Fable invented by &s;ome of their <HI>Sciechs,</HI> to obtain more credit to their Prophet; for <HI>Mecha</HI> is di&s;tant from <HI>Cairo</HI> one and thirty days journy, as the <HI>Caravan</HI> makes them, there|fore it is impo&s;&s;ible that a Well &s;hould be in <HI>E|gypt</HI> <PB N="141" REF="74">proceeding from a Sour&s;e at &s;uch a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>After that we had eaten in the re&s;ting place, and drank of this good Water out of devotion, we went into the Garden, where heretofore the Balm trees were Planted, which yielded Balm on|ly when they &s;tood in this place, and were watered with the Water of the miraculous Well. One may read my Book upon this Subject, called <HI>The Church of Alexandria;</HI> where many remarkable things may be found, very curious, concerning the&s;e Trees and this Well.</P>
<P>In this Garden was heretofore to be &s;een the Sicamore-tree, which, as the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay, &s;plit in two miraculou&s;ly, to hide our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his mo&s;t holy Mother, when the Souldiers of
<HI>Herod</HI> pur&s;ued him: They &s;ay, that when they hid them&s;elves in this opening of the Sicamore, they &s;aved them&s;elves from the Souldiers vio|lence, by the favour of a Spiders Web that cover|ed them &s;uddenly, and appeared very old, though it was made in an in&s;tant by a Miracle: &s;o that that they imagin'd not that any Per&s;on could be hid within, much le&s;s the Per&s;ons whom they were &s;eeking.</P>
<P>The <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> of the Holy Land, that dwell at
<HI>Cairo,</HI> di&s;pute with the Keepers of this Garden, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Tree; and &s;ay, that it fell down with old age in the year 1656. and that they gather'd then up the pieces which they keep carefully in their place of Relicks; I have &s;een them there. The Gardiners yet &s;hew in this Gar|den a Stump which I have &s;een, which they &s;ay are the remains of this Sicamore. But this di&s;|pute concerns me not much, neither do I think that I &s;hould oblige tho&s;e Fathers to maintain
<PB N="142" REF="75">their intere&s;t in this ca&s;e that is &s;o trivial.</P>
<P>When we had &s;een this Sicamore, we went out of the Garden to &s;ee the Needle, which is out of the Village, planted in the open Field, where &s;tood anciently the City <HI>Heliopolis.</HI></P>
<P>This Needle is not equally &s;quare, for there are two &s;ides larger than the others: The large&s;t are each of &s;ix Foot, and the narrowe&s;t of five and a half. There be but few Characters graven upon it, but they be yet to be read; and tho&s;e that are graven in one &s;ide, are al&s;o in the three others. It is of a red Stone, as all other Needles that I have &s;een in <HI>Egypt,</HI> Planted upon the ground without any Ba&s;is to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>Near this Needle is a &s;quare Stone of an extra|ordinary bigne&s;s, which &s;eems to have been the Ba&s;is of &s;ome great Pillar; but it is worn on the &s;ides, therefore I neglected to take the mea&s;ure of it.</P>
<P>In this Field <HI>Sultan Selim</HI> encamp'd with his Ar|my, when he engaged in a Fight with <HI>Sultan Cajed Bey,</HI> the la&s;t King of the <HI>Mammelucs;</HI> &s;ome of the Trenches of his Camp are yet to be &s;een.</P>
<P>I went next alone from <HI>M&aacute;-Tarea</HI> to
<HI>M&iacute;nied Sored,</HI> another Village hard by on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, to &s;ee a miraculous Image of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, which the <HI>Copties</HI> keep in their Church; of which I have read a Miracle in an <HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI> Manu&s;cript, which I found in the Mona&s;tery of
<HI>Koskam,</HI> near <HI>Momfallot</HI> in the middle <HI>Egypt,</HI> at my fir&s;t Voyage into <HI>Egypt.</HI> As &s;oon as I had &s;een it, I return'd to
<HI>Cairo.</HI></P>
<P>The 17th of <HI>July, Saturday</HI> Night, I went to the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> &s;cituated out of the Old <HI>Cairo</HI> at the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, about half an hours <PB N="143" REF="75">riding on Hor&s;e-back, in the Field called, in <HI>Arab. Birket &s;iech Ombarek,</HI> or the Lake of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Sciech;</HI> where I &s;pent the Night to hear Ma&s;s; for the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay it ordinarily after Midnight.</P>
<P>The next day I return'd back to my Lodging, and &s;aw in my pa&s;&s;age all the Churches and Mona|&s;teries of the <HI>Copties</HI> which are in Old <HI>Cairo;</HI> leaving on our left hand the three Churches which are in <HI>Babylon Ma&s;&s;r,</HI> which was heretofore part of Old
<HI>Cairo,</HI> but is now totally de&s;troyed. I began my vi&s;it by the Churches that are in <HI>Ca&s;&s;r I&s;&s;|c&eacute;mma.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Churches, and Mona&s;teries of <HI>Ca&s;&s;r I&s;&s;c&eacute;mma.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t was that of <HI>Ma&aacute;llaca:</HI> It is a very ancient Church, &s;tately and very clear; and I may &s;ay that it is the mo&s;t beautiful that the <HI>Copties</HI> have in <HI>Egypt.</HI> It is the Metropolis in which the Patriarch performs his fir&s;t Divine Service.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> bought it of <HI>Amru ibn il A&s;&s;,</HI> as may appear by the Contract written upon the Walls of this Church with the Hand of this Prince, who cur&s;eth there all the <HI>Mahometans</HI> that &s;hall offer to take it from them.</P>
<P>There be five <HI>Heikels,</HI> or Chappels, in a rank; but &s;eparated the one from the other with little Grates of Wood: &s;o that five Ma&s;&s;es may be read at once, and the Prie&s;ts need not interrupt one a|nother.</P>
<P>At the entry of this Church a little Image is to be &s;een, at the right hand, upon one of the Pillars: which Image, the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay, &s;poke to S. <HI>Ephrem,</HI> <PB N="142" REF="76">one of their Patriarchs, to comfort him in his af|fliction, when <HI>Me&eacute;z le din alla,</HI> the <HI>Califf,</HI> com|manded him to tran&s;port Mount <HI>Gebel il moc&aacute;ttam,</HI> which now &s;tands behind the Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Cairo,</HI> from one place to another, to prove the truth of his Religion; becau&s;e our Saviour Chri&s;t &s;aith in the Go&s;pel, <HI>If you had faith as a Grain of Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, you &s;hould &s;ay to this Mountain, remove thence to yonder place, and it &s;hall remove; and nothing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible unto you.</HI> He threatned him therefore that if he did not remove it, that he would de|&s;troy all his Nation, as a People that profe&s;&s;ed a fal&s;e Religion, and that de&s;erved not to live a|mong&s;t them that were Believers. Becau&s;e this Image &s;poke then to their Patriarch, to comfort him and a&s;&s;ure him that he &s;hould remove the Mountain in &s;pight of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who had anger'd this <HI>Califf</HI> again&s;t them, they highly re&s;pect it.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Ma&aacute;llaca,</HI> I went to vi&s;it <HI>Sancta Barba;</HI> where, as my leader told me, the Body of this Saint re&s;ts at the left hand of the Chappel. This Church is great and very light, and therefore &s;eems to me to be the mo&s;t plea&s;ant of all the re&s;t. There be al&s;o three Chappels in a rank.</P>
<P>I &s;aw next the Church of Saint <HI>Sergius,</HI> which was built, as <HI>Said ibn Patrik</HI> &s;aith in his Hi&s;tory, by a
<HI>Coptie,</HI> a Secretary to <HI>Abd ilaziz ibn Meru&aacute;n,</HI> a
<HI>Califf</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Under this Church is to be &s;een a Cave, in which, as the
<HI>Copties</HI> hold by Tradition, Chri&s;t with his mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Mother have lived a while. It is divided into three Angles, or Parts, by little Pil|lars. In the fir&s;t, at the entrance, is the Bapti&s;|mal Font of the
<HI>Copties:</HI> At the bottom of the middle &s;eparation is a place in the Wall, and in <PB N="145" REF="76">this place a Stone, which, as the
<HI>Copties</HI> believe, hath been &s;anctified with the &s;teps of our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour. The religious <HI>Francs</HI> &s;ometimes &s;ay Ma&s;s here. In the third &s;eparation is ano|ther Stone &s;anctified al&s;o by our Saviour's foot|&s;teps.</P>
<P>In the Cave, I remember not well in which &s;eparation, is to be &s;een the Epitaph of a Gentle|man of <HI>Europe,</HI> buried there about two hundred and &s;eventy five years ago, in <HI>Gothick</HI> Letters; but the Stone is plac'd up&s;ide-down, through the ignorance of the Ma&s;on, as I believe; this is the Epitaph.
<Q>Hic jacet Nobilis Petrus Louys IX. Neapollo|nies, qui obiit M.CCCC.II. die. XI. Febru|arii.</Q></P>
<P>Next to this Church, I vi&s;ited that of our ble&s;|&s;ed Lady, in the Street called <HI>Darb itt&aacute;ka.</HI> It is very &s;mall, and very ob&s;cure. Out of this Church I &s;aw a little round Stone of black Marble, lying upon the ground; about it were graven &s;mall Hieroglyphick Letters.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from this Church, through an Alley, is to be &s;een the remains of a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Temple, called in <HI>Arab. Kobbet il fors,</HI> or <HI>the Temple of the Per&s;ians,</HI> which
<HI>Artaxerxes Ochus,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> caus'd to be built in honour of the Fire; and though the Ruines are but &s;mall, they di&s;cover yet that this Temple was hereto|fore very &s;tately. In the in&s;ide, about the Walls, are to be &s;een &s;everal &s;tandings, or holes, as high as a Man, in which it is probable they plac'd their Idols.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="77">
<P>I &s;aw next the Church of <HI>Mary Girges,</HI> or of S.
<HI>George,</HI> which is in the &s;ame Street called <HI>Darb itt&aacute;ka,</HI> or <HI>the Street of the Window.</HI> It is very an|cient, and of a mean beauty. At the entrance, on the right hand, is to be &s;een the Body of <HI>Am|ba Bi&s;&s;&uacute;ra,</HI> Bi&s;hop and Martyr, with his Epitaph in <HI>Arabick,</HI> which I could not place here, becau&s;e the Printer had not the Characters.</P>
<P>Next to this Church I went to &s;ee the Mona|&s;teries of the Nuns, among&s;t the <HI>Copties,</HI> called <HI>D&eacute;r il ben&aacute;t,</HI> or <HI>the Mona&s;tery of the Maids,</HI> which was built, as they &s;ay, by a King called <HI>Alexander;</HI> but it is a place &s;o filthy and &s;tinking, that I could not &s;tay there any time.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Church that I &s;aw in this Ca&s;tle, was that of the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>George,</HI> of the religi|ous <HI>Greeks.</HI> In this Church is to be &s;een an I|mage of this Saint, that, as they &s;ay, hath the Power to heal and cure Fools.

<HEAD>Churches, and Mona&s;teries, in the Patri|arch's Quarters.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Quarters of the Patriarch, named in <HI>Arab. Haret il B&aacute;trak,</HI> a Suburb of it &s;elf, on this &s;ide of <HI>Ca&s;&s;r I&s;&s;c&eacute;mma,</HI> is the Church of <HI>Mary Moncure.</HI> It is very great, high, and built with very &s;trong Walls. In this Church the Pa|triarch of the <HI>Copties</HI> is cho&s;en and con&s;ecra|ted.</P>
<P>It hath been ruinated by the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and turn'd into a Store-hou&s;e of Sugar-Canes. It continued &s;o to the days of the Patriarch <HI>Ephrem,</HI> <PB N="147" REF="77">who, in the Reign of <HI>Meez le din alla,</HI> having tran&s;ported the Mountain called <HI>Gebel il moc&aacute;t|tam,</HI> which now &s;tands behind the Ca&s;tle of

<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> to be fal&s;e, got an Order from him to the Court of <HI>Beit il mal,</HI> or <HI>Trea&s;ure of the Goods of the decea&s;ed;</HI> that out of this Trea|&s;ure this Church &s;hould be re-built with all the Apartments that are round about, and all the lit|tle Churches that are above it: Which was ac|cordingly performed, as may be &s;een in the Hi|&s;tory of the Patriarch's of <HI>Macrizi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mekkin,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;torian, confirms this Relation; and a&s;cribes this Miracle to this Saint, as he &s;aith in his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>V&aacute;deh ibn R&eacute;gia,</HI> a Noble Man among&s;t the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who turned Chri&s;tian; a little while after being very thir&s;ty at <HI>Mecha,</HI> he pray'd to this Saint that he might be carryed into this Church, becau&s;e at that time the River <HI>Nilus</HI> running clo&s;e by, he might there quench his violent thir&s;t. This Saint carried him immedi|ately into this Church in one Night, a way that the
<HI>Caravan</HI> cannot perform in le&s;s than eight and thirty, or forty days.</P>
<P>At the entrance into this Church, on the left hand, is the Cave where dwelt heretofore <HI>Amba Ber&s;um il Eri&aacute;n,</HI> or <HI>Saint Ber&s;um the naked;</HI> which was before the abode of a Serpent that did much hurt to the Inhabitants round about. In the Walls are to be &s;een the holes where he hid him|&s;elf, but as &s;oon as the Saint was enter'd in to do Penance, the Serpent ca&s;t it &s;elf at his feet, to do him homage, and afterwards it never hurt a|ny body. In this Cave is a little Altar to &s;ay Ma&s;s.</P>
<PB N="148" REF="78">
<P>A little above this &s;ame Church there is four or five &s;mall Churches which I had liberty to &s;ee the night of the Fe&s;tival of the

<P>Near this Church, is that of <HI>Amba Scin&uacute;de,</HI> or of Saint <HI>Sennodius;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;hut it, to draw from the <HI>Copties</HI> a &s;um of Money, therefore I could not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>When I was out of the Patriarch's Quarters, I went &s;traight to

<P>And becau&s;e <HI>Egypt</HI> is &s;uch a Country that one cannot travel in it all the year, and in every &s;ea|&s;on, for &s;ometimes you are hinder'd by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive heats that burn and &s;corch your bodies, &s;ometimes by the overflowing of <HI>Nilus</HI> that bu|ry all the Fields under water, and &s;ometimes be|cau&s;e the <HI>Arabians</HI> are &s;cattered about the ways; and when the&s;e inconveniencies don't hinder, the

<P>In this &s;ea&s;on I undertook this Journey that I had long de&s;igned; I went from <HI>Cairo</HI> Monday the 21. of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>And that I might not fall into the &s;ame danger as at

The <HI>Cadi</HI> thinking therefore that he had a per&s;on from whom he might draw a &s;um of Money, becau&s;e he believ'd that I was a Mer|chant come thither to buy Wines in the Vintage|time to carry them to <HI>Cairo,</HI> which Commodity is forbidden in all the Territories of the Grand Seignior, he de&s;ired the <HI>Naib Gaibe,</HI> or <HI>Soubachi</HI> of the place, to endeavour to find out my de|&s;igns, and to let him under&s;tand them; for he promi&s;ed to give him half the money that he &s;hould get out of me, if I did buy any Wines.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the <HI>Naib Gaibe,</HI> or
<HI>Soubachi,</HI> a Renegade <HI>Fleming,</HI> who &s;poke well his Mother|tongue, came to my lodging with two Ruffians, and enter'd into my Chamber whiles I was taking out my Cloaths, and without &s;aluting any body, &s;ate down in a Corner, which is the place that be|longs to the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in the Ea&s;t-Countries: The Ruffians &s;tood at the door, lean|ing upon their Staves. I was mightily &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee &s;uch a per&s;on come to vi&s;it me. I called to my <HI>Janizary</HI> to know what he would have; he an&s;wered, that he under&s;tood that I was a <PB N="152" REF="80"><HI>Franc,</HI> and that he was come to know whether I would buy any Wine, becau&s;e he would recom|mend me to that which was very good. I re|ply'd, that if he had no other bu&s;ine&s;s, he might &s;pare him&s;elf the trouble and pains that he took, that I was never a Merchant of Wines, and would not now begin; and that we <HI>Francs</HI> care not much for the poor Wines of his Country. To this he held his peace.</P>
<P>He enquir'd what Countryman I was; when I had told him that I was of the City of <HI>Erford</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> he &s;eem'd to rejoyce, becau&s;e he had found one in &s;uch a far Country whom he might name his Countryman, for he &s;aid he was of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> He promis'd me his friend&s;hip; we eat afterwards together, and I caus'd him to drink Wine as much as he would, which was very plea|&s;ing to him: when the liquor had a little chear'd his &s;pirits, he di&s;cover'd to me the de&s;ign of the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> and the cau&s;e of his Vi&s;it; by this means he became one of my be&s;t Friends in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and my &s;afety whiles I continued in that Town, with|out whom I &s;hould not have e&s;cap'd the Train that was laid for me.</P>
<P>After a little re&s;t in my lodging, I &s;ought &s;ome means to &s;trike acquaintance with the Bi&s;hop of the place, called <HI>Amba Michel,</HI> who had a very good repute of an hone&s;t and a learned man, becau&s;e I was de&s;irous to have &s;ome body to con|ver&s;e with, and to &s;pend my time with &s;ome ad|vantage to my &s;elf; I obtain'd this with ea&s;e, for he came a few days after and lodg'd at my hou&s;e: I am much beholding to him for many things that he hath told me concerning their Belief and Ceremonies, which I have in&s;erted in my <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<PB N="153" REF="80">
<P>Let us now &s;ee the de&s;cription of the Town and Territory of
<HI>Fium.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Fium,</HI> the chief of the Province whereof it bears the name, is large and full of people: It is built upon the Ruines of the old <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> which is near adjoyning on the We&s;t-&s;ide. Though the mo&s;t part of the hou&s;es are but little, and made of Bricks dried in the Sun, they are neverthele&s;s commodious, and &s;ome, where the Officers and Commanders dwell, are large and beautiful. There be many <HI>Copties</HI> Chri|&s;tians, and a Bi&s;hop, but no Church within the Walls; they perform their Devotions at <HI>De&s;ie,</HI> a Village near by.</P>
<P>An artificial Channel cut from the River pa&s;|&s;eth through this City, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: They name it <HI>Bahr Ju&s;ef,</HI> or the
<HI>River of Jo&s;eph,</HI> for they believe that <HI>Jo&s;eph, Jacobs</HI> Son, caus'd it to be made. 'Tis call'd al&s;o <HI>Calitz il Menhi,</HI> or the
<HI>Channel of Menhi.</HI> This Channel is remarkable, becau&s;e it keeps fre&s;h water all the year, which proceeds from &s;everal Fountains there, but it is too &s;hallow to carry Boats but when the River overflows. It begins about three days journey from <HI>Fium,</HI> drawing towards the South, near a Village named <HI>Tarut I&s;&s;cerif,</HI> where I have been. It runs, when it hath left the Town, into the Lake named <HI>Birket il Kern,</HI> or the Lake of
<HI>Cha|ron,</HI> where the waters become &s;alt.</P>
<P>In this Town are to be &s;een many Relicks of Antiquity, as Capitals, Antick Works, Pillars of Marble broken. In the Corn-market is to be &s;een a great Pillar, entire laid upon the ground, and a great Mill-&s;tone, both of a red &s;tone; and almo&s;t in all hou&s;es is to be &s;een &s;omething very remarkable for its antiquity.</P>
<PB N="154" REF="81">
<P>Here is made much Linen for the hou&s;e, and Canvas to pack up the Commodities of the Coun|try: They have a great deal of Flax, which yields a great benefit; &s;trak'd Linen is plentiful here, and very good, with which the Country|people cloath them&s;elves. The Leather of this Country is much e&s;teem'd, but chiefly the Blan|kets that are made here are the fine&s;t of the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> and are carried all over the world. Here are al&s;o made Sacks of Network of Cord, to carry upon Camels Straw, or dried Dung to burn, or Stones, or &s;ome &s;uch thing, for they ne|ver u&s;e Carts.</P>
<P>This Territory is very fruitful and plea&s;ant, and all that grows here is of a better ta&s;te than in the other Provinces. Here are Fields full of Ro&s;e-trees, and Woods of Fig-trees, which are not in other parts of
<HI>Egypt.</HI> The Gardens are full of all manner of Trees, bearing Fruit; as Pear-trees, Orange-trees, Lemon-tree, Peach-trees, Plumb-trees, Apricock-trees, and many others that are &s;ent to be &s;old at <HI>Cairo,</HI> which yields them a great profit.</P>
<P>In <HI>Fium</HI> only, of all the Provinces of <HI>Egypt,</HI> are Vineyards; and in the&s;e Villages only, in <HI>Fidimin</HI> where I have been, in <HI>Nacalife, Seliin, Abuke&s;a, Agiamiin, Gerrado,</HI> and
<HI>Tobhar.</HI></P>
<P>They make Wine thus: They pre&s;s the Grapes either with their Feet, or other wi&s;e, into a great Earthen Ve&s;&s;el; they put afterwards the new Wine into a Sack of cour&s;e Linen, and &s;train it into another Ve&s;&s;el; from thence they draw it, and &s;ecure it in Jars well pitch'd within, which contain about twelve thou&s;and Drams. Now the&s;e Jars they place in the Sun during &s;even days, <PB N="155" REF="81">leaving them open, that the new Wine might purge it &s;elf; they &s;top them afterwards with Palm-leaves, and cover them clo&s;e with Mud. They leave their Wine in this manner, till they intend to drink it.</P>
<P>This Wine is not much e&s;teemed of by the <HI>Francs,</HI> becau&s;e there remains &s;o much dregs that come out into the Cup with the Wine; but if they had but the art of clearing and clarifying the Wine, it would be doubtle&s;s a very plea&s;ant Wine, for the Grapes are very &s;weet, and plea|&s;ing to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I have not &s;een a Province in <HI>Egypt</HI> that is &s;o much cut into Channels as this: They all pro|ceed from <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> River, and they are made to water the Fields with more ea&s;e; and becau&s;e this great number of Ditches would hinder men from travelling up and down, were it not for the Bridges, here be more than in any other part of <HI>Egypt.</HI> They are all made with burnt Bricks, and very &s;trong: The Tradition &s;aith, that they were builded in the days of the <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s; and it is the opinion of the <HI>Copties,</HI> that the&s;e Kings imployed the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in making Bricks for the&s;e Bridges, which is very probable; for it is certain, that almo&s;t an infinite number of men are needful to make &s;uch a prodigious quantity of Bricks.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Fium</HI> anciently had three hundred three&s;core and five Towns and Villages, but now there be but three&s;core and two; all the other have been &s;wallowed up in the Lake <HI>Kern,</HI> or de&s;troyed by the tyranny of the Governours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> dwells in the Town: He pays now to the
<HI>Pacha</HI> five and twenty Pur&s;es, and five <PB N="156" REF="82">to his
<HI>Kehaja,</HI> or Lieutenant, and to his <HI>Agas.</HI> He pays for his Province two hundred pur&s;es in four payments. The <HI>Divan</HI> of
<HI>Cairo</HI> allows him three Cornets of Hor&s;e, or <HI>Spahins,</HI> to keep his Coun|try, unto whom he pays every &s;ix Months five and twenty
<HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> which is but a &s;mall allow|ance; &s;o that they are but poorly clad, and ap|pear as &s;o many Beggars, rather than as the Soul|diers of &s;o great an Emperour.</P>
<P>The ancient Town of <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> &s;cituated near
<HI>Fium,</HI> on the North-Ea&s;t-&s;ide, is now totally rui|nated: There remains nothing of it now, but a great many Mountains very high rai&s;ed, with the ruines and rubbi&s;h of the Town. They &s;hew &s;ufficiently, that it was one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Cities of <HI>Egypt.</HI> The people of the Country call it, <HI>Medinet Fares,</HI> or <HI>the Town of the Per&s;ian;</HI> but I could never under&s;tand the cau&s;e of this name.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that it was de&s;troyed and burnt by Cats, which the Enemies &s;et into it when they had tyed Fire-brands at their Tails, which &s;cat|tered the fire into every corner of the City, and burnt it to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> call it in their Books <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> calls all that Province, the <HI>Government of Ar&s;inoe.</HI></P>
<P>On the 24th of this Month I went to <HI>Fidintin,</HI> a Village di&s;tant from <HI>Fium</HI> about two hours ri|ding, towards the We&s;t, to vi&s;it the Bi&s;hop, who was gone thither out of the <HI>Ca&s;ciefs</HI> &s;ight. I was cloathed in a Turki&s;h habit, with a <HI>Janizary</HI> and a
<HI>Negre</HI> well armed, upon good Hor&s;es. Our coming put the poor Bi&s;hop into &s;uch a fright, that he thought him&s;elf already kill'd, when he
<PB N="157" REF="82">heard that three &s;trange Hor&s;e-men ask'd for him. He thought at fir&s;t that we were &s;ome &s;ent by the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> to do him an injury. The&s;e poor people are become wonderful timerous, through the continual tyranny of tho&s;e Barbarians, &s;o that at the lea&s;t motion they tremble and &s;hake. He was pretty well &s;atisfied, when I told him that I was a <HI>Franc</HI> come purpo&s;ely to crave acquain|tance with him: He entertain'd us in a very poor dwelling, invited us into his Parlour, and treat|ed us with very good Wine of the Country. When we had &s;pent &s;ome hours in conver&s;ation with him, we went to &s;ee the Vines of that Quarter, and in the Evening we return'd home to the City.</P>
<P>The 29th of the &s;ame Month I went to <HI>Bija|muh,</HI> a Village about half a League from <HI>Fium,</HI> towards the North, to &s;ee an ancient thing, the Body of a great Statue of a Gyant, of a red Stone, without Head or Arms, &s;tanding upon a Ba&s;is. This Statue is behind the Village, in a great broad Road.</P>
<P>I could never learn what it is, becau&s;e the Country-people have no Tradition of it; and in the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Egypt</HI> there is no mention made of it. I have only learnt that the people of the Country call it the <HI>Statue of Pharaoh;</HI> which I think not to be true, becau&s;e it is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> to entitle all things of an extraor|dinary bigne&s;s with the name of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> from a conceit they have that they were all Gyants.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;is of this Statue is &s;quare, of hewn &s;tones that are very great, every &s;tone hath two foot and a half in breadth, and almo&s;t ten foot in length; the fore-front hath five Perches in length, that is about thirty foot.</P>
<PB N="158" REF="83">
<P>Near this Ba&s;is five others &s;tand in a Demi|circle, but le&s;s, and without any Statue upon them.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop inform'd me, that heretofore in this Village was an
<HI>Agia&s;ma,</HI> or <HI>Fountain of holy Water,</HI> called by the Arab.
<HI>Ein il Mandura;</HI> and that every <HI>Holy-Thur&s;day</HI> a great many Chri&s;ti|ans were wont to meet there to drink of this Water out of devotion, but that the people of the place, who are all <HI>Mahometans,</HI> have &s;top'd it up, to prevent the continuance of this Super|&s;tition.</P>
<P>When we had well &s;een the&s;e things, we re|turn'd to the Town, and in our way we went o|ver the Ruines of the ancient
<HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> where I &s;aw nothing remarkable, but &s;ome old Walls which my Guide told me were the remains of a Bath.</P>
<P>When we were come near the Town, we left it on the left hand, and went to &s;ee the <HI>Needle of Bibig,</HI> whereof this is the de&s;cription.</P>
<P>This Needle is placed on the ground, without any Ba&s;is, in the middle of a Corn-field, in a place where is no hou&s;e, nor mark of any that hath been there.</P>
<P>It is di&s;tant from <HI>Fium</HI> about a long half league, near a Village called <HI>Bibig,</HI> from whence it bor|rows the name. This Village is &s;cituated on the South-we&s;t of <HI>Fium,</HI> and belongs unto it.</P>
<P>It is built in a long &s;quare, very high; its lar|ge&s;t &s;ides have &s;ix foot, and the narrowe&s;t are of four. This Needle abuts not into a &s;harp point, as others in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but the top is made like an A&s;&s;es back: On the South-&s;ide, which is one of the large&s;t, there are three ranks of Ima|ges, <PB N="159" REF="83">that repre&s;ent Men and Women holding one another by the hand: under the&s;e three ranks be|gin fourteen ranks of Hieroglyphick Characters, about the bigne&s;s of a finger, which are to be read from the top to the bottom; every rank is divided from the other, which is near, with a line that is drawn between, all along the Nee|dle: So that without doubt this Needle is the mo&s;t curious that may be &s;een. In every one of the le&s;&s;er &s;ides is but one rank of le&s;&s;er Chara|cters, which yet continue very clear and beau|tiful.</P>
<P>There is one thing to be lamented at, that time hath almo&s;t blotted out the Figures, from the middle of the Pillar to the bottom; and that the Stones have not been able to defend them|&s;elves from corruption, being much worn out: It is of a red Stone, as all others.</P>
<P>Its top is like an A&s;&s;es back, and very large, &s;it for the Vultures and Hawks to pitch upon it at night: The&s;e Birds have &s;o whitened it with their dung, that the uppermo&s;t Figures are &s;carce to be di&s;cern'd.</P>
<P>I have taken notice, that all the Needles that I have &s;een in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;tand not upon any Ba&s;is, but upon the ground, which makes me believe that the invention of planting them upon a Ba&s;is, is not derived from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but from the <HI>Romans,</HI> who having taken notice that this kind of Pillar was very u&s;eful, and contain'd great My&s;teries in their Characters, they have rais'd them upon a Ba&s;is, to render them more remark|able and con&s;iderable to the curious. We re|turn'd to the Town about Noon.</P>

<HEAD>A little Journey to <HI>Sennuris.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>S&V;nday</HI> the 31. of <HI>July</HI> I went to
<HI>Sennuris,</HI> a Village belonging to the <HI>Ca&s;cieflik</HI> of
<HI>Fium,</HI> &s;cituate on the North of this Town, and about four hours travelling on Hor&s;eback, to &s;ee the remains of Antiquity that are there, and there|abouts; be&s;ides my Servants, &s;ome other <HI>Copties</HI> Chri&s;tians went with me.</P>
<P>When I had a little re&s;ted my &s;elf at <HI>Sennuris,</HI> in the hou&s;e of <HI>Sciech il Beled,</HI> the Chief of the Village, a
<HI>Moor,</HI> where my friends oblig'd me to take my lodging, I went to take notice of the Village, which is great, and very beautiful; and at the &s;ame time I &s;aw the Church of the <HI>Cop|ties</HI> dedicated to the Archangel
<HI>S. Michael,</HI> but it is very mean.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I took notice there of one thing very remarkable, namely, a &s;quare &s;tone, where are three little Figures cut the fir&s;t repre&s;ents the Archangel <HI>S. Michael,</HI> the middle repre&s;ents the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who holds in her Arms her Son, and the third the Angel <HI>Raphael.</HI> The names of every one is written underneath in Greek Letters, in the <HI>Copties</HI> Language. This &s;tone is a foot and a half long from &s;ide to &s;ide: The Prie&s;ts informed me, that this Stone was hereto|fore in the Chancel, but when they &s;aw that the people render'd homage to the&s;e Figures, they plac'd them in a corner of the Church, that they might hinder them from Idolatry. They offer'd it to me for a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> and a half, becau&s;e I &s;eem'd to value it at a high rate; I would not take it, be|cau&s;e I had no intent to return &s;o &s;oon to <HI>Cairo,</HI> but to go further into <HI>Sayda.</HI></P>
<PB N="161" REF="84">
<P>At the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of the Village, about a Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot from it, is to be &s;een a very ancient Bridge of Bricks, made for a Pa&s;&s;age for the River when it overflows. The People of the Country &s;ay, that <HI>Jo&s;eph, Jacob</HI>'s Son, cau&s;ed it to be built. It is apparent by its Ruines, that here|tofore it was very great, but now there remains no more but four Arches.</P>
<P>Round about this Village is &s;own a great deal of Flax, but it is not e&s;teem'd &s;o good as that which grows in other parts of
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>At that time there was, as well as at, <HI>Fi&uacute;m,</HI> a want of fre&s;h Water, becau&s;e the people of the Country u&s;ually ca&s;t into the River their Hemp, where they take their Water to drink; this had &s;o poi&s;oned the Waters, that they did &s;tink, &s;o that I was forced to cau&s;e &s;ome fre&s;h Water to be brought from <HI>Fi&uacute;m,</HI> which is about four hours di&s;tant from this Village.</P>
<P>In an evening I walk'd to &s;ee the Lake <HI>Kern,</HI> which is very near <HI>Senn&uacute;ris,</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide.</P>
<P>This Lake is narrow, but long, for I was told that it is about two days travelling for a Hor&s;e, in length. This is doubtle&s;s the Lake
<HI>Miris</HI> men|tioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> when he &s;aith, <HI>Inter Ar&s;ino&iuml;ten Prafecturam, ac Memphiten Lacus fuit, circuitu CCL.M. pa&s;&s;uum, aut ut Mutianus tradit, CCCCL.M. &amp; latitudinis L. pa&s;&s;uum, manu factus &agrave; Rege qui fecerat Moeridis appellatus:</HI> For there is no other Lake between <HI>Fium,</HI> which is <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> and the City of
<HI>Memphis,</HI> or the place where it &s;tood.</P>
<P>At its <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> end is plac'd the Village
<HI>Tam&iacute;ch,</HI> mentioned before; and in its <HI>We&s;t</HI> end is the fa|mous Ca&s;tle of <HI>Vizir Caron,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="85">
<P>This Lake receives all the Waters that run from the Fields when
<HI>Nilus</HI> is overflown, and from the River of <HI>Jo&s;eph&punc;</HI> they become &s;alt be|cau&s;e the Earth is full of Niter.</P>
<P>Here is much Fi&s;h, chiefly a Fi&s;h called is <HI>Arab. Houd,</HI> which I have de&s;cribed in the Chap|ter concerning the Fi&s;h of
<HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the Lake are De&s;arts of Sand very large; I have heard from Per&s;ons worthy to be believed, that there are to be &s;een many remarkable Ruines of ancient Towns, par|ticularly of <HI>Temeh i&s;&s;ebag,</HI> or of <HI>Temeh</HI> of <HI>Lieus;</HI> a Town &s;o named becau&s;e of the Statues of <HI>Lieus</HI> that were there to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o to be &s;een the Ruines of an ancient Mona&s;tery named <HI>Deir Abul&iacute;fe,</HI> or the Mona|&s;tery of
<HI>Abul&iacute;fe.</HI></P>
<P>They told me, that they had &s;een the Labyrinth which is at the end of the Lake <HI>We&s;terly,</HI> mention|ed by <HI>Pliny,</HI> when he &s;aith, <HI>There was a Labyrinth in the Lake of Moeridis, built without any Wood.</HI> This Labyrinth is named now by the <HI>Egyptians, Ca&s;&s;r Carun,</HI> or the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Vizir Caron;</HI> a fa|mous Lord in the Hi&s;tories of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> be|cau&s;e of his Trea&s;ures which are &s;aid to be here buried, and kept by dreadful <HI>Tali&s;mans.</HI> They tell me, that this Ca&s;tle hath three hundred and three&s;core and five Chambers, &s;o intangled one into another that a man cannot get out, if when he comes in he doth not take notice of the way.</P>
<P>This Report gave me a great de&s;ire to venture to &s;ee all the&s;e Wonders at any rate: I had already agreed with the Chieftain of the Village, to have from him a Guard of twelve Men, whom he knew
<PB N="163" REF="85">to be faithful and tru&s;ty; but my Jani&s;&s;ary, a timerous Fellow, &s;poil'd my de&s;ign, by &s;hewing me the danger there was of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> he threatned likewi&s;e the Guard, to tell the
<HI>Ca&s;cief,</HI> which would have created me &s;ome trouble.</P>
<P>I conceive that this Relation may beget a de|&s;ire in &s;ome Traveller to go and &s;ee this Curio&s;i|ty, therefore I will give him a little advice which &s;hall help him to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t know, that he ought not to go to the Labyrinth from
<HI>Sennuris,</HI> or to the other &s;ide of the Lake, but to <HI>Senhur,</HI> a Village di&s;tant from <HI>Sennuris</HI> about an hours travelling; for there the Fi&s;her-men of the Lake <HI>Caron</HI> dwell, who are be&s;t able to carry Men thither: But it is ve|ry needful that a <HI>Franc,</HI> who will undertake this Voyage, be well learn'd in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue, that he be well cloathed according to the Mode of the Country, that he may not be known, and chiefly let him di&s;&s;emble his de&s;ign as much as he can; for if he fails in any of the&s;e particulars, he will doubtle&s;s be lo&s;t. The
<HI>Moors,</HI> who are very jealous of the Trea&s;ures that are &s;aid to be there, will knock him on the head, that he may not carry them away.</P>
<P>I &s;taid three days at <HI>Sennuris,</HI> for the place did plea&s;e me, and the Inhabitants were very civil. I return'd to <HI>Fium,</HI> &s;econd day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> very much di&s;pleas'd with my Jani&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e he had cro&s;s'd my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of this Month the Water of <HI>Nilus</HI> enters into the Channel of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> which pa&s;&s;eth through
<HI>Fium,</HI> as we have &s;aid. Then its Waters are purified, and purged from its &s;tink|ing qualities which the Flax and Hemp give it: <PB N="164" REF="86">Then the Ci&s;terns of the Town are fill'd with Water, which the Inhabitants drink all the year long, therefore this inundation makes all the people of the Country round about to rejoice.</P>

<P>BEtween the Towns of <HI>Fium</HI> and <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> which are di&s;tant the one from the other about a little days Journey, there be two great <HI>Pyramides;</HI> the one is near <HI>Fium,</HI> the other nearer to <HI>Bene&s;uef.</HI> The fir&s;t is named <HI>Haram Havara,</HI> the
<HI>Pyramide</HI> of <HI>Havara:</HI> The other <HI>Haram Ila|hun,</HI> the
<HI>Pyramide</HI> of <HI>Ilahun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> I went to that of <HI>Havara,</HI> &s;o called from the neighbouring Vil|lage
<HI>Havara.</HI> It Stands about an hour and a halfs walking from
<HI>Fium,</HI> on the South &s;ide, &s;cituated in a &s;andy Wilderne&s;s, like that which is over a|gain&s;t <HI>Cairo,</HI> where the <HI>Pyramides</HI> &s;tand: when we were gone beyond a certain Bridge of Brick, very old, which is upon the Highway of <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> we left it, to take a &s;horter cour&s;e; but we found cau&s;e to repent it, becau&s;e the way was craggy and full of Sand.</P>
<P>We were oblig'd al&s;o to go through the <HI>Bahr Belame,</HI> or the River without Water, which cau&s;|ed us to endure much trouble and fear, in regard of the depth that was extraordinary, and our be|ing forced to climb up again. And when we had overcome all the&s;e difficulties, and were near the
<HI>Pyramide,</HI> about &s;ix hundred Paces from it we met with a Ditch of the River of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> full of Water; we could not get over it, but were forced to &s;tay <PB N="165" REF="86">on that &s;ide, and from thence take a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w, at a di&s;tance, of the
<HI>Pyramide,</HI> to my great di&s;plea|&s;ure. I took notice, that in its elevation and breadth, it was much like the &s;econd <HI>Pyramide</HI> which is at <HI>Gize,</HI> but the length of time hath al|mo&s;t reduc'd it to Du&s;t, &s;o that it appears like a &s;harp Mountain of Sand, rather than a
<HI>Pyra|mide.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;art where it &s;tands, is like that of the
<HI>Mommies</HI> which is near <HI>Sacc&agrave;ra.</HI> Some Wells of
<HI>Mommies</HI> are here to be found, whereof the en|try is fill'd up with Sand, and &s;ome are half empty. Upon the ground are &s;cattered, here and there, Bones of <HI>Mommies,</HI> broken Wood, and pieces of Coffins; &s;o that one may &s;ay that it is altoge|ther like that of <HI>Sacc&agrave;ra.</HI></P>
<P>But becau&s;e we were without any Guide, and my Jani&s;&s;ary was a very Coward, having none but him with me, he allarm'd me &s;everal times with the fear of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> be&s;ides, our Bea&s;ts were tired with the deep way; I was therefore con|&s;train'd to &s;et bounds to my Curio&s;ity, and to re|turn to the Town, pa&s;&s;ing through the River with|out Water, near its Mouth, leaving on our left hand, near the <HI>Pyramide</HI> of
<HI>Havara,</HI> the Ruines of an ancient Town, whereof I could never un|der&s;tand the name; and a little further, on the &s;ame &s;ide, the Village of <HI>Havara,</HI> from whence this <HI>Pyramide</HI> borrows the name, and at a little di&s;tance from this Village, a very ancient Bridge, and very high, which is made to give a pa&s;&s;age to the River <HI>Nilus</HI> when it overflows: We return'd to <HI>Fium</HI> again about Noon.</P>
<P>For the other <HI>Pyramide,</HI> called of <HI>Ilahun;</HI> the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;torians &s;ay, that <HI>Jo&s;eph, Jacob</HI>'s Son,
<PB N="166" REF="87">cau&s;ed into be built. It is &s;o nam'd from the Vil|lage
<HI>Ilahuis,</HI> near adjoining, belonging to the <HI>Ca&s;|cieflik</HI> of
<HI>Bene&s;uef;</HI> but becau&s;e I could not look upon it, but at a di&s;tance, I cannot well de&s;cribe it. The Reader may &s;ee what
<HI>Macrizi</HI> faith of it.</P>

<HEAD>A Walk to the Mona&s;tery <HI>Ca&s;ciabe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 19th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> I went to the Mona|&s;tery of
<HI>Ca&s;ciabe,</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Fium</HI> about two hours walking, or thereabouts, drawing to|wards the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, called by the <HI>Arabians, Gebel Naklon,</HI> or <HI>the Mountain of Naklon.</HI></P>
<P>In our way to this Mona&s;tery we went over &s;everal Bridges of Brick, very &s;trong, made by the ancient <HI>Egyptians:</HI> And we left at our right hand at the entry of the Wilderne&s;s, which is about half way, the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Deir il azeb;</HI> and a little further, at our left hand, the Ruines of an ancient Town overthrown, of which I could ne|ver learn the name.</P>
<P>The Mona&s;tery of <HI>Ca&s;ciabe</HI> is very ancient; it is almo&s;t totally ruinated, unle&s;s it be the Church dedicated to the Arch-Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> which is very beautiful, and painted in the in&s;ide with the Pa&s;&s;ages of holy Writ. The top of this Church is &s;upported by Pillars that &s;tand at a di&s;tance, and of divers Stones. Under this Church is ano|ther that I could not &s;ee, becau&s;e the Provi&s;ions of the Mona&s;tery were there &s;hut up.</P>
<P>This Church was built by one named <HI>&V;r,</HI> the Son of
<HI>Ibra&s;cit,</HI> a very famous Magician; who, <PB N="167" REF="87">as the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;tories relate, had this Child by a Daughter of an Ea&s;tern King. When at la&s;t this <HI>&V;r</HI> had left the Art of Magick which his Fa|ther had taught him, he addicted him&s;elf to Vir|tue, &s;o that afterwards he became Bi&s;hop of <HI>Fium,</HI> and built this Church, and Tradition &s;aith, that the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> laid the Foundation-&s;tone of the Church, and of the Altar, and the Archangel S. <HI>Michael</HI> mark'd out the Quire, and the re&s;t of the Church.</P>
<P>Many remarkable things happened whiles this Church was building; I mention them not for brevity &s;ake, they that will under&s;tand them, may read the <HI>Arabian</HI> Manu&s;cript mentioned be|fore, and now in the Kings Library.</P>
<P>On the top of the Mountain, behind this Mo|na&s;tery, on the South-&s;ide, are yet to be &s;een the ruines of an ancient Town, which the
<HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay was inhabited by the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> and for this cau&s;e they name it yet <HI>Mod&s;ellet Jacub,</HI> or the Tabernacle of
<HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>A little higher, upon the &s;ame &s;andy Moun|tain, are to be &s;een many Caves where the Her|mits anciently lived; I went into &s;ome of them out of curio&s;ity, they are very little, and there is in them nothing extraordinary: when I had taken a view of all that was remarkable, I re|turn'd to <HI>Fium</HI> in the Evening.</P>
<P>The Country had been &s;ome days dround about <HI>Fium,</HI> which oblig'd the Commanders of the <HI>Militia,</HI> and the
<HI>Ca&s;cief,</HI> to retreat to <HI>Cairo.</HI> And becau&s;e the Robbers are very formidable at this time, and commit many di&s;orders, I was oblig'd to return al&s;o to <HI>Cairo.</HI> I went from <HI>Fium</HI> the 16th of
<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the morning, and re|turned <PB N="168" REF="88">the &s;ame way that I came, and the next day I was at <HI>Cairo</HI> in the Evening, after five and twenty days abode at <HI>Fium.</HI></P>
<P>At my return to <HI>Cairo,</HI> I began my <HI>Church of Alexandria;</HI> a very curious work, and very u&s;e|ful to the world, and chiefly to the Learned that de&s;ire to under&s;tand how the Churches of the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> agree with the <HI>Roman.</HI> It contains all the Ceremonies and Doctrines of the Ancient and Venerable Church of the <HI>Copties,</HI> which is that of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> I have taken them out of two Manu&s;cripts in <HI>Arab.</HI> very ancient and rare, un|known to us in
<HI>Europe</HI> before now; the one is called <HI>il Mosbah iddolme d' Abulbaracat,</HI> and the other, <HI>il Giauharet innefi&s;&s;e fielm il Keni&s;e.</HI> I have been very exact and diligent in compo&s;ing this Book, that it might render my name immortal. I &s;hall endeavour to give it to the Pre&s;s as &s;oon as I &s;hall be return'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> where I make my ordinary abode.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> which was the third
<HI>Friday</HI> after the opening of the <HI>Calitz,</HI> a skilful Swimmer cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be admired of all the City, by a very bold action; he had his arms tyed behind his back, his feet tyed at an Iron Chain, which weighed ten pounds: In this man|ner he ventur'd to &s;wim upon his back, from the mouth of the <HI>Calitz.</HI> to the end of the Town, which is about three quarters of an hour walk|ing a-foot.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom hath been anciently us'd in <HI>Cairo:</HI> A skilful Swimmer performs this every year, two <HI>Fridays</HI> following after that the <HI>Calitz</HI> is open'd. The <HI>Pacha</HI> gives him for his reward a thou&s;and <HI>Meidins,</HI> which make three and thirty
<HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI></P>
<PB N="169" REF="88">
<P>The Guards of the <HI>Soubachi</HI> went before him in a Boat, to hinder him from receiving any harm: about five and twenty other Boats full of Spectators followed. He &s;wum this year but once, becau&s;e <HI>Ibrahim Pacha,</HI> who loved not &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s expences, commanded him away when he came to demand his ordinary wages; therefore in&s;tead of a thou&s;and
<HI>Meidins,</HI> he gave him but one hundred.</P>
<P>There is another that &s;wims in the &s;ame man|ner as this, from the beginning of the <HI>Calitz</HI> to the end of the City. He had his feet tyed with a Chain, a Di&s;h of Coffee in one hand, and a Pipe of Tobacco lighted in the other, at his mouth. The <HI>Pacha</HI> u&s;ually gives him the &s;ame reward; but becau&s;e the former had not had his u&s;ual Sala|ry, this la&s;t would not this year &s;hew his dexteri|ty. I was told that the&s;e Swimmers eat nothing for three days but Cich-Pea&s;en, and that they &s;wallow their breath &s;o long time, which cau|&s;eth their Bellies to &s;well, and become light as an empty Bladder. I was told al&s;o, that &s;ometimes they kill them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t become very &s;ick.</P>
<P>On the 12th of <HI>September</HI> the <HI>Pacha</HI> cau&s;ed the Trea&s;ure of the Grand Seignior to depart for <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with its ordinary guard and pomp.</P>
<P>There were one and thirty Mules loaden with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coyn, and <HI>Zequins</HI> of <HI>Venice.</HI> This Trea|&s;ure amounts u&s;ually to one thou&s;and two hun|dred Pur&s;es, and each Pur&s;e to five hundred Crowns. The <HI>Sangiac-Bey</HI> that carries it is obli|ged to expend all the Moneys needful for this Voyage, and it co&s;ts him u&s;ually one hundred Pur&s;es, or fifty thou&s;and Crowns. The <HI>Caravan</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="89">begins to march in the beginning of the Moon and arrives at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> at the end of one hundred days.</P>
<P>This Trea&s;ure is taken fir&s;t out of the <HI>Carache,</HI> or Tribute of the Lands and Villages which the Farmers Rent of the <HI>Divan;</HI> for all the Lands of <HI>Egypt,</HI> unle&s;s it be the Patrimony of the
<HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and the Lands belonging to <HI>Micha,</HI> are the Grand Seigniors, becau&s;e he conquer'd <HI>Egypt</HI> with the Sword. 2. It is taken out of the <HI>Douanes</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> of
<HI>Bouquir,</HI> of <HI>Damietta,</HI> of <HI>Brullos,</HI> of
<HI>Boulak,</HI> and of <HI>Ibrim.</HI> 3. Out of the <HI>Chordis.</HI> 4. It is taken out of the Lakes and Pits of <HI>Nitre,</HI> which are in the De&s;art of S. <HI>Ma|carius,</HI> and out of the Salt-pits near <HI>Alexandria.</HI> 5. From the Shambles of <HI>Cairo,</HI> whereof I have already &s;poken. 6. From the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e or <HI>Douane</HI> of the <HI>Bohars,</HI> or
<HI>Spices;</HI> and generally from all Merchandizes imported from <HI>Mecha, Mocoa,</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> 7 From the <HI>Mint.</HI> 8. From the
<HI>Giavali,</HI> or Tribute which the Chri&s;tians of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the <HI>Jems</HI> are oblig'd to pay for their Heads. 9. From the Trea&s;ure called <HI>Beit il mal,</HI> which comprehends all the decea&s;ed goods. 10. From the Office of Surveyor of the Provi&s;i|ons.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day I &s;aw the Mo&s;que of <HI>Califfe Hakem be amr ille:</HI> It &s;tands out of <HI>Cairo</HI> upon the Mountain called <HI>Gebel il mocattam;</HI> but now there appears nothing but the Walls.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Califfe</HI> had made near this Mo&s;que a place to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e of the Stars, named in <HI>Arab. Ra&s;&s;ad ve Mofatek beta Hakem,</HI> which is now ruinated; he made u&s;e of it to make his
<HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> as art in which he was very skilful. <PB N="171" REF="89">The <HI>Egyptians</HI> &s;ay that he could go in and out into all the Caves under ground, where he knew the Trea&s;ures of the ancient Kings and Lords of <HI>Egypt</HI> to be hid, and that he could make u&s;e of them when he pleas'd; and that by the power of Magick, and the extraordinary skill that he had in that Art.</P>
<P>According to the example of tho&s;e great men, a little before his death he buried his own Trea|&s;ures, and put a Crocodile made by the Tali&s;ma|nical Art to keep them.</P>
<P>In this Mountain, and near this Mo&s;que, he cau&s;ed &s;everal Caves to be digg'd wide and large in the Rock, &s;o as to pa&s;s from one into the o|ther; in the furthermo&s;t he cau&s;e a Pond to be made to keep water in, cut in the Rock; in it is a Crocodile that begins to fly at one as &s;oon as a man enters in. Moreover, in the bottom of the water, is to be &s;een a door which leads to o|ther Caves under ground, where the Records of <HI>Egypt</HI> declare that his Trea&s;ures are hid. No man can imagine from whence this water can come, for the Cave is upon a high Mountain which is very dry always, and in this place is no Spring: And it is not known what this Croco|dile is, and how he may be nouri&s;hed, during &s;o many ages. To take this Trea&s;ure, you mu&s;t know how to undo this Tali&s;man, that is, one mu&s;t take away the water, and the life of the Crocodile; for both are the effects of Magick, which depend upon the Art of the Tali&s;mans.</P>
<P>I have been very diligent in <HI>Egypt,</HI> to &s;eek for, and &s;end to <HI>Paris,</HI> among&s;t other rare Manu|&s;cripts, the anciente&s;t and be&s;t Authors of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> which might give &s;ome light and
<PB N="172" REF="90">knowledge of this Noble Science. I may &s;ay that I have emptied <HI>Egypt</HI> of &s;uch kind of Books, with an intent that if I was ever admitted to the &s;ervice of him who had given me this Commi&s;|&s;ion, I might have the time and the means to di&s;|cover with ea&s;e the admirable &s;ecrets of this Science, and to unfold the Enigms under which it lies hid; and by the &s;ame means to di&s;cover of what con&s;equence tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts are, though they are de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome that under&s;tand not neither their price nor u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Reader may peru&s;e an <HI>Arabian</HI> Manu|&s;cript in
<HI>Quarto,</HI> called, <HI>Eijun it hekajek, ve eidah il terajek,</HI> of
<HI>Meimun</HI> the Magician that teach|eth the means to de&s;troy all manner of Tali&s;|mans. He may read another in <HI>Octavo,</HI> called, <HI>Kitab gaiet il maareb, Fi menajeh ve il chabaia, ve il medaleb,</HI> that di&s;covers the places of all the Trea&s;ures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> their value, the Figure of the Tali&s;man that keeps them, and how to de|&s;troy them; I have &s;ent them both to the Kings Library.</P>
<P>On the 12th and 20th of <HI>September,</HI> I went to &s;ee the Great Aqueduct, called in <HI>Arab. it Migro,</HI> that conveys water from the River into the <HI>Pa|cha</HI>'s Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This Aqueduct is near <HI>Nilus</HI> in old <HI>Cairo;</HI> the Mouth there &s;tands a Ca&s;tle of a Hexagone Fi|gure very high, &s;upported by as many Arches very lofty. There is an a&s;cent through a large way, open towards Heaven, made &s;loping about, for the conveniency of the Oxen that draw wa|ter out of the River, and cau&s;e it to mount up by &s;even Wheels as high as the Platform on the top of the Ca&s;tle, where there is a large Pond
<PB N="173" REF="90">or Ba&s;on to receive the water, and about it &s;even great holes like Wells, which have given the name to this Ca&s;tle of the
<HI>Seven Wells.</HI> The wa|ter runs from this Ba&s;on into the Aqueduct, which appears, and from thence it goes into the <HI>Caraffe,</HI> which is at a great di&s;tance, where it meets with the Earth as high as the Aqueduct; and then it &s;tops there, and runs next into a Channel under ground to the
<HI>Pachas</HI> Stable, from whence it runs into his Ci&s;tern, and fur|ni&s;hes the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This Aqueduct is &s;upported by three hundred and &s;eventeen high Arches, and not by three hun|dred and fifty, as a certain Traveller &s;aith, for I have exactly number'd them my &s;elf: They are made as well as the Ca&s;tle of great &s;quare &s;tones, cut as we do Diamonds: One of the Supporters on the chief &s;ide is about eight foot nine inches broad, and under the Arch it is only eight foot. The opening of one of the Arches is fourteen foot and a half broad.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay that <HI>Mekaukes,</HI> a famous man of their Nation, and Governour for the Empe|rour <HI>Heraclius,</HI> made this Aqueduct, but they are mi&s;taken; for when this man governed in
<HI>E|gypt,</HI> the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cairo</HI> was not in being, for it was built four hundred and forty four years af|ter; and therefore this Aqueduct that now &s;up|plies it with water was not then needful; be|&s;ides, the In&s;criptions in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue de|clare, that this is a work of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Kings; if I be not mi&s;taken, I have read that it was Sultan <HI>Gauri,</HI> the la&s;t King but one of the <HI>Mam|melukes,</HI> that cau&s;ed it to be built.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pacha</HI> taketh out of the Revenues of the
<PB N="174" REF="91">Grand Seignior all that is needful to keep up this Aqueduct; for that purpo&s;e be nouri&s;heth three&s;core Oxen, and gives wages to five men and a <HI>Ciurbachi</HI> that looke after it.</P>
<P>On the 13th of the Month of <HI>September,</HI> I went to vi&s;it the Patriarch of the <HI>Copties,</HI> one of my be&s;t Friends; and becau&s;e I had often in|treated him to come and dine with me, I reite|rated the &s;ame intreaty now again; but he an|&s;wered me, that he had not been out of his hou&s;e a year before for fear of the <HI>Turks:</HI> He com|plain'd, that all the Patriarchs of the other Sects had the liberty to go about the Town, without fear of being di&s;turb'd by any, to vi&s;it whom they pleas'd, and to travel whither they li&s;ted; but he was &s;o narrowly ob&s;erved by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> that he could not &s;o much as go out of his hou&s;e, nor talk with any of other Nations openly, much le&s;s travel into any other place, but he mu&s;t give them a jealou&s;ie of plotting again&s;t the State; by this means his life would be in danger.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that there is no Nation in
<HI>Egypt</HI> &s;o much afflicted as are the <HI>Copties,</HI> be|cau&s;e they have no body among&s;t them who de|&s;erves to be honoured for his Knowledge, or feared for his Power and Authority&punc; for all that were rich and wealthy, are de&s;troyed by the cruelty of the <HI>Mahometans:</HI> therefore the re&s;t are now look'd upon as the Scum of the World, and wor&s;e than the
<HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> abu&s;e them at their plea&s;ure; they &s;hut up their Churches, and the doors of their Hou&s;es when they plea&s;e, upon light occa&s;ions, altogether unju&s;t, to draw from them &s;ome &s;ums of Money.</P>
<P>There was &s;uch a tyrannical Action practi&s;ed
<PB N="175" REF="91">upon them in this Month of <HI>September;</HI> for cer|tain Jani&s;&s;aries cut the Throat of a Whore, and ca&s;t her Body into the Lake <HI>Ezbekie.</HI> Upon that the <HI>Soubachi</HI> nailed up the Doors of all the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Copties</HI> round about, and cau&s;ed them wrongfully to lay down the Sum of two thou|&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> for this blood &s;pilt, before they could have their Hou&s;es opened again, and free|dom for their lives.</P>
<P>They endured another Cruelty in the &s;ame Year; for <HI>Pacha Ibrahim</HI> increa&s;ed their ordina|ry Tax in this manner.</P>
<P>Till this Year they were not all obliged to pay the &s;ame Sum of Money. They were not all bound to pay it into the Trea&s;ury of the Grand
<HI>Seignior;</HI> for &s;ome were bound to pay it to certain
<HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> othere to <HI>Sciech il Becri,</HI> who is a great Lord, and comes from <HI>Abn Becr, Califf,</HI> or Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and others to other Lords, called in <HI>Arab. Sadats.</HI> They that payed to the <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> or Lords, were called <HI>Lay-Tribu|taries:</HI> And they that payed to the Trea&s;ure of the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI> were called
<HI>Tributaries of the Grand Seignior.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;ort of Tribute is very moderate, becau&s;e it &s;eldom amounted to above two <HI>Pia&s;ters;</HI> but the la&s;t hath always been, and is yet, one hundred and twenty
<HI>Para's,</HI> that is, four <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> and a quarter. Be&s;ides this, the Vil|lages and Towns were taxed only in common: For Example, &s;uch a Village was tax'd to pay &s;uch a Sum, according to the number of the Chri|&s;tians that dwell there; and when the <HI>Chouli,</HI> or the Collector, went to receive it, he tax'd every one according to his ability: The poor paid lit|tle, the rich more; &s;o that this Tribute was e|qual.</P>
<PB N="176" REF="92">
<P>But in this Year 1672. <HI>Ibrahim Pacha</HI> taxed them all as Tributaries to the Grand <HI>Seignior;</HI> and upon the &s;ame account cau&s;ing them all to pay equally one hundred and twenty <HI>Para's;</HI> out of which the <HI>Pacha</HI> paid that which was due to the Lords and
<HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and the re&s;t was put into the Grand <HI>Seigniors</HI> Coffers.</P>
<P>This novelty hath reduc'd the poor <HI>Copties</HI> to de&s;pair; therefore when the Collectors come into any Village to gather the Tribute, they fly to the Mountains, leaving all to &s;ecure them&s;elves from violence, and affronts that would be done to their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>That the Receivers of the Tribute might know them that have paid it, they leave a little Ticket of coloured Paper, &s;ealed with the Seal of their Chieftain, where the name of the Chri&s;tian is written, his Village, his Province, his Dwelling, his Age, the Day, the Month, and the Year that he hath paid.</P>
<P>But they put not into this Ticket the whole Sum of one hundred and eight and twenty <HI>Para's,</HI> which they require, but only one hundred and three, becau&s;e there is no more that goes into the Trea&s;ury of the Grand <HI>Seignior;</HI> the other five and twenty <HI>Meidins</HI> are for the Farmer of the <HI>Caraffe,</HI> paid to him becau&s;e of the great expen|ces which he is at, to entertain a great many Men for the di&s;charge of his Office. The Chri&s;tians carry always with them this Ticket, to &s;hew it when they are que&s;tioned by the Men that be|long to the Farmer, and this is their Acquit|tance.</P>
<P>The 18th of <HI>September</HI> I bought, of an <HI>Arabian,</HI> a great <HI>Lizard,</HI> alive, called in their Language, <PB N="177" REF="92"><HI>Varal.</HI> I cau&s;ed it to be skinned, and &s;ent the Skin to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnoul,</HI> Superintendent of the Kings Galleys at
<HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>The body of this <HI>Lizard</HI> was altogether like that of the
<HI>Crocodile,</HI> the Skin excepted, which was gray and &s;potted, as that of a <HI>Serpent,</HI> and without any Shells. It was three-foot long, and had five Fingers to each Foot, and long white Nails, as have the
<HI>Crocodiles.</HI> Its Tongue was forked as that of a <HI>Serpent,</HI> the Headlong, and the Muzzle &s;harp. Its Teeth were &s;trong, and cut|ting; the
<HI>Arabians</HI> told me, that its biting was venomous and deadly.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince recover'd another of a differing &s;ort, when I was in the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Anthony.</HI> The Head of this was like that of a <HI>Tortell,</HI> and its Tail very big, and le&s;&s;ening by degrees, and ending into a &s;mall point. It was full of knots round about, as &s;o many Shells. This <HI>Lizard</HI> was not venomous, for I took it with my Hand, and when I had well con&s;ider'd it, I gave it to an <HI>Arabian</HI> Dog that eat it.</P>

<P>I &s;aw nothing remarkable in this way. The Villages, and Mona&s;teries, before which we pa&s;|&s;ed, were the Convent or <HI>Deir il aduvie</HI> men|tioned before, the Convent of the Abbot <HI>Ber&s;um il erian,</HI> or or <HI>S. Ber&s;om the naked,</HI> &s;cituate in the

<HI>Nilus. Bou&s;che,</HI> a great Village on the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> where the Monks of S. <HI>Anthony</HI> have their Farm: at la&s;t, <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of this River.</P>
<P>He that will travel to the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>An|thony,</HI> ought fir&s;t to land at <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> and enquire from the Chri&s;tians of that place, whether the ways be free or not. If they be free, he ought to go to <HI>Beiha,</HI> which is a Village &s;cituate almo&s;t over again&s;t
<HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> in the
<HI>Ca&s;cieflik</HI> of <HI>Atfieh.</HI> There he ought to bar|gain with the
<HI>Arabians</HI> that dwell there, concern|ing the price, the number of the Camels, and Men that he de&s;ires to lead with him: which when he hath done, he ought to cau&s;e them to confirm the Bargain before &s;ome of their Chief|tains, by repeating over the <HI>Fatha,</HI> which is the fir&s;t Chapter of their <HI>Alcoran;</HI> for which the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have a great veneration, and as much as the Chri&s;tians have for their <HI>Pater,</HI> or
<HI>Credo;</HI> otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t not expect that they will be faithful. But when they have &s;aid th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Prayer he may go with them confidently, at if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="179" REF="93">were with his own Brethren: which &s;ufficiently declares, that there is no people in the World, never &s;o barbarous and &s;avage, but have a re|&s;pect for their own Religion. And if at any time any other cro&s;s intere&s;t hath blinded them to commit any perfideous Action, God hath pu|ni&s;hed them at the &s;ame in&s;tant for it with &s;eve|rity; &s;o that they would have wi&s;h'd that they had kept their Faith, as the Reader may under|&s;tand by what follows.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Price that he is to give them, he ought to grant them &s;ome quantity of Beans for their Camels, and give them &s;ome
<HI>Meidins</HI> to buy Sandals, for the ways are full of &s;harp &s;tones: He ought to buy them &s;ome Meal, black Bisket, ordinary Hony, and Tobacco, as much as will be needful, to accompli&s;h the Voyage, and the num|ber of the Men. He mu&s;t not forget every Morning and Evening to give a Di&s;h of Coffee to every one; if he delivers it generou&s;ly, and freely, he may promi&s;e to him&s;elf a happy Voy|age, and to be well tended. The <HI>Arabians</HI> have the care to provide Ve&s;&s;els to grea&s;e, and fill them with the River-water, for there is none to be found in the way; or if there be, it is &s;o noi&s;ome, and ill-ta&s;ted, that it is not drinkable.</P>
<P>There is two ways that lead from this Village <HI>Beiha,</HI> to this Mona&s;tery. The fir&s;t called, by the <HI>Arabians, il Tarik il Kihli; the upper way:</HI> and the other <HI>il Tarik il bahri, the under way;</HI> in re|&s;pect of this Village from whence they &s;et out.</P>
<P>The under way is the &s;horte&s;t, the mo&s;t fre|quented, and that which the <HI>Caravan</HI> takes, keep|ing upon the bank of the River for a while; and when one leaves it, the way turns at the right hand
<PB N="180" REF="94">into the Wilderne&s;s, to a place called <HI>Gibei.</HI> There is the fir&s;t Well which Nature hath digged deep in a firm Rock, into which the Rain-water runs; which Water is white as Milk, and &s;weeter than that of <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>About a days Journey farther is another, at the left hand of the High-way, at the foot of a high Mountain, called <HI>Gebel il cheleil;</HI> but its Water is noi&s;ome and green, and the We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> is full of Canes. A little farther is another, very well known to Travellers, becau&s;e it is near the Dwel|ling of a famous
<HI>Arabian</HI> called <HI>Eid il beidavi;</HI> but the <HI>Caravan</HI> never goes thither but when they want Water, becau&s;e it &s;tands from the High-way, at a di&s;tance: Therefore when they are furni&s;hed with Water at the &s;econd Well, they pa&s;s at the left hand &s;treight to the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>The upper way leads from <HI>Beiha</HI> towards the
<HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and after a day and a halfs travelling it goes to the
<HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> In this way are neither Wa|ters, nor Trees, nor Hou&s;es, nor Gra&s;s; there|fore it is needful to make good Provi&s;ion of Wa|ter at
<HI>Beiha</HI> for the whole Journey.</P>
<P>Therefore, knowing this before, I took at <HI>Beiha</HI> a Camel purpo&s;ely to carry Water, and four o|thers for me and my followers, the
<HI>Aby&s;&s;in,</HI> the <HI>Coptie,</HI> and <HI>Idris</HI> my
<HI>Blackamoor.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e, I took with me five <HI>Arabians,</HI> armed with Lances, to go on foot, and take charge of the Camels; and to protect us, if perchance any Robbers &s;hould have a&s;&s;aulted us; &s;o that we were in all ten in number, and five Camels. When we had got all that was needful for the Voyage, we went from <HI>Beiha</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> the 30th of
<HI>September,</HI> about three a Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<PB N="181" REF="94">
<P>Though the under way was the &s;horte&s;t, and the mo&s;t frequented, yet we cho&s;e the upper way, that we might not meet with the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> the declared Enemies of tho&s;e that conducted us. When we had travelled four days through a boundle&s;s Plain of Sand, which was not move|able, but hard, and full of &s;harp cutting &s;tones, that cut as &s;o many Razors, we arrived at la&s;t, through a thou&s;and turnings, to the Mona&s;tery, the third day of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> which includes another, anciently peopled by the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins,</HI> and now totally ruinated, is in the Wilderne&s;s, now called in <HI>Arab. Gebel Araba,</HI> or the Mountain of Carts; becau&s;e heretofore Provi&s;ions were car|ried thither upon Carts, and not upon Camels, as now.</P>
<P>It is built upon the decline of the Mount <HI>Col|zim,</HI> at its <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> end, which reaches from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to
<HI>South:</HI> It appears like a long Square; and the Front of the Mona&s;tery, which &s;tretches from <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>North,</HI> looks again&s;t another Mountain called <HI>Gebel il Cheleil,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>It is incompa&s;&s;ed in with an high Mountain, but feeble, and unable to make any re&s;i&s;tance; for it is old, and built with Bricks dried in the Sun. There is no Gate to the Mona&s;tery, one enters in by a Pulley, Men and Bea&s;ts are all drawn up over the Wall.</P>
<P>It hath a large Circuit, about &s;ix hundred <HI>Fid|dans,</HI> or two thou&s;and four hundred Acres with|in the Walls.</P>
<P>The Monks of the <HI>Levant</HI> dwell not together in the &s;ame Cells, as tho&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> but every <PB N="182" REF="95">one hath a little Hou&s;e or Cell to him&s;elf, and the&s;e Cells are more or le&s;s beautiful and conve|nient, according as the Country hath experien|ced the cruelty of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Therefore the Mo|na&s;teries of the
<HI>Levant,</HI> and chiefly tho&s;e of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> are like &s;o many great Towns or Ca&s;tles, becau&s;e of their Walls, Turrets, and number of hou&s;es that are within; but the Mo|na&s;teries of <HI>Egypt</HI> have nothing of that &s;plen|dour, becau&s;e the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have been here more cruel than in any other Country &s;ubject to them. Neverthele&s;s, this Mona&s;tery is like tho&s;e of <HI>Greece,</HI> for it is &s;urrounded with Walls: In the middle is a Dungeon, and round about many Hou&s;es where the Monks live; but in regard it has been de&s;troyed long ago by the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> it hath remain'd in that condition three&s;core and ten years: The <HI>Copties</HI> who have lo&s;t, under the tyranny of the
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> all their &s;trength and power, could never yet re&s;tore it to its former e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Therefore the Cells now are very little, and poor, of yellowi&s;h Earth, without Timber, Plai|&s;ter, Order, or Symmetry: they are &s;o low, that a man may ea&s;ily reach up to the top with his hand: therefore the Monks cannot well &s;tand upright: there is a little light that enters in through holes in the wall, about a foot long; the doors are &s;o low, that one mu&s;t &s;toop low to go in; that which is mo&s;t commodious, is that they have all flat roofs for the Monks to take the air at night, when the Sun is gone, and to &s;leep when they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Their dining-place is very dirty, and ob&s;cure: There is for Strangers a place of it &s;elf, large <PB N="183" REF="95">and decent, with two other Chambers hard by to put their Goods and Cloaths; and a little Kit|chin.</P>
<P>The Gardens are very large, and great, and con&s;iderable, becau&s;e of the Herbs and Fruits that they bring forth. One might make of them the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Gardens of the World, be|cau&s;e of their convenient &s;cituations, for they lie &s;helving, with beautiful Plains.</P>
<P>There are two &s;mall Vines that yield a &s;ort of White-wine, very delightful: They u&s;e it in &s;ay|ing of Ma&s;s, and in treating Strangers of Qua|lity that come thither.</P>
<P>In this Mona&s;tery is a great quantity of fre&s;h water, as clear as Cry&s;tal, but very &s;alt. It runs from the Mount <HI>Colzim,</HI> near by, in little &s;treams, under the Walls, into the Gardens, where they receive it in places made on purpo&s;e. They drink it, and make other u&s;es of it. It is not very whole&s;ome, chiefly for tho&s;e that are not accu|&s;tomed to it; for the <HI>Niter</HI> that infects it, cau|&s;eth Bladders to ri&s;e under the Skin, and tor|ments &s;uch as drink of it with itching, as I have found by experience.</P>
<P>Here are three Churches, the chief is that of S.
<HI>Anthony;</HI> it is little, but very ancient; and as the Monks told me, it is the &s;ame that S. <HI>Anthony</HI> built, and the only thing of the Mona&s;tery that hath e&s;cap'd the rage of the <HI>Arabians.</HI> Within are Pictures of many Saints, painted in an an|tick and &s;imple fa&s;hion: The &s;moak of the Fran|kincen&s;e that is burnt there at Divine Service, hath made them appear as black as a Chimney.</P>
<P>Near this Church is another dedicated to S. <HI>Pe|ter</HI> and S. <HI>Paul,</HI> within a little Tower, and one <PB N="184" REF="96">Bell, about a foot and a half in Diameter: &s;erves to call the Monks to the Service of God, and to their other imployments. There is no o|ther Bell in all
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>The third Church is in the Garden, dedicated to a Lay Monk, called <HI>Mark,</HI> who died with a Reputation of Holine&s;s; his body is kept there.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Mona&s;tery there is a &s;quare Tower, with &s;tone Walls, very &s;trong; from the bottom of the Tower to the Gate, which is about three Perches high, it is very firm: on the top is a Draw-bridge that leads to this Gate; but to come to it, one mu&s;t climb up to the top of an hou&s;e, over again&s;t it. In this Tower the Monks keep all their Provi&s;ions, and their be&s;t Moveables; and they fly to it when the Rogui&s;h
<HI>Arabians</HI> threaten them: They then draw the Bridge, and beat them off with Stones from the Plat-form.</P>
<P>Their Rule obliges them to renounce Matri|mony for ever, all carnal de&s;ires, their Parents, to po&s;&s;e&s;s no E&s;tate, to dwell in the Wilderne&s;s, to be cloathed with Wooll, to be girt with a Lea|thern Girdle, to eat no Fle&s;h, nor drink Wine all their life-time, unle&s;s they be reduc'd to the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;horten their dinner, and to de|ny them&s;elves all the nouri&s;hments without which the body is able to live. It commands them to imploy all their time in fa&s;ting, and pray|er, and wor&s;hip, to have always their mind run|ning upon God, to apply them&s;elves to the read|ing of the Holy Scriptures, and to under&s;tand the Truths that are there contain'd.</P>
<P>It obliges them to &s;leep upon a Mat, or the ground, their Superiour excepted, and &s;uch as <PB N="185" REF="96">are &s;ick; not to take off their Cloaths, and their Girdle, never to &s;leep two upon the &s;ame Pil|low, nor near one another. In &s;hort, their Rules oblige them to repeat the Canonical Pray|ers, to pro&s;trate them&s;elves before they go to Bed, one hundred and fifty times, with their Fa|ces and Bellies to the ground, to &s;pread out their arms in a cro&s;s, with the fi&s;t &s;hut, and at every ri&s;ing to make the Sign of the Cro&s;s; which Pro&s;trations they call
<HI>Metanoe.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e one hundred and fifty Pro&s;trations, they perform &s;even at the Church; one before every Canoni|cal Prayer, which make up in all one hundred and fifty &s;even Pro&s;trations; which together with the poor nouri&s;hment that their bodies take, renders them very lean, and ca&s;t down; &s;o that they appear like &s;o many Skelletons, rather than men.</P>
<P>Their Cloaths are fir&s;t a Shirt of white Wooll, which they wear always upon their skin. 2. A Wa&s;tcoat of brown Wooll, very cour&s;e, not o|pen before. 3. A Ve&s;t of black Serge, with two large Sleeves. 4. Their Capuchin is likewi&s;e of black Serge, very little, and made fit to the Head.
5. Their Girdle is of Leather, three &s;in|gers broad. 6. The <HI>Mezerre,</HI> called by the <HI>Cop|ties</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, and &s;ometimes
<HI>Biggos,</HI> is a great Man|tle of black Stuff, lined with white, like the Cloaks of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> only it is without Collar; unle&s;s it be when they Travel, they &s;eldom u&s;e it. The 7. is <HI>Askim,</HI> or the
<HI>Angelick Habit,</HI> called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, which few of the Monks wear, becau&s;e they have not &s;trength enough, as they &s;ay, to do the Penance that the Canons have ap|propriated to it; for they that bear it, are obli|ged <PB N="186" REF="97">to pro&s;trate their Face and Belly to the ground, with their arms a-cro&s;s, three hundred times every night before they &s;leep, be&s;ides the fa&s;ting, and other mortifications thereunto an|nex'd. I have &s;ent one of the&s;e <HI>Askims</HI> to the Kings Library, which
<HI>Amba Michel,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Fium,</HI> gave me as a token of his love.</P>
<P>They carry always a &s;tick in their hands, made in the form of a <HI>Tan,</HI> T, upon which they lean when they are at their prayers; for they per|form them &s;tanding, and are very tedious in them. They have all upon their heads a Bonnet, called in <HI>Arab. Cauk,</HI> which is like that which the <HI>Mahometans</HI> wear; about which they wrap a Turbant of a Stuff &s;traked with blew and white, which is the colour of all the <HI>Copties</HI> in <HI>Egypt:</HI> They never wear any Stockings, nor their Patri|arch.</P>
<P>The Fa&s;t-days they ob&s;erve, by eating then but one Meal; but on the <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays</HI> they never fa&s;t, but eat twice. On the Fa&s;t-days they dine con&s;tantly about three a Clock in the Afternoon; then they end Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Their ordinary diet are Pul&s;e and Herbs &s;ea|&s;oned with the &s;tinking Oyl of Hemp: For their De&s;&s;erts they have Fruits, as Onyons, dried Dates, rotten Olives, Melons, or Cucumbers, or Pompions, or &s;uch like Fruits as are in &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>They never eat Fle&s;h in the Mona&s;tery; but when they are out they may eat it; for their Founder never forbad them, as they &s;ay: For fre&s;h Fi&s;h they &s;eldom have any, becau&s;e their Mona&s;tery is &s;o far di&s;tant from <HI>Nilus,</HI> and there is no convenient carriage to bring them any. And though the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> be within a little days
<PB N="187" REF="97">Journey, they cannot have any fre&s;h Fi&s;h, becau&s;e the Sea-coa&s;t being not inhabited, they have no In&s;truments to catch Fi&s;h; and the ways are dangerous, becau&s;e of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Rogues and Robbers.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> they never fa&s;t, but eat Eggs and Milk, which are &s;ent to them from their Farm; only three times a year they have liberty to drink Wine, at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and
<HI>Penteco&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;leep always in their Cloaths; and in|&s;tead of a Blanket, they have only a Mat, very cour&s;e, made with Palm-leaves, and &s;tretched a|long upon the ground. They are the makers of them; they call them in <HI>Arab. Bur&s;ch.</HI></P>
<P>Their imployments are not the &s;ame, accord|ing to every mans ability: Some manure and dre&s;s the Gardens, others are Cooks, others grind at the Mill; &s;ome are upon the Guard, to give notice when any Travellers go by, or come, and others are appointed to draw up tho&s;e that will come in, and let down tho&s;e that de&s;ire to depart; &s;uch as have no imployment, make Mats.</P>
<P>They never &s;tudy; they are &s;atisfied in read|ing Books of Devotion: among&s;t the re&s;t, they read often the <HI>Synaxar,</HI> or
<HI>Book of Martyrs;</HI> the <HI>Pa|radi&s;e of Monks,</HI> the
<HI>Climax,</HI> or <HI>the Ladder of Ver|tue</HI> of <HI>John, Abbot of the Mona&s;tery of Mount Sinai;</HI> the Sermons of <HI>Paul de Bu&s;ch,</HI> upon the Fe&s;tivals of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and &s;uch like. When I was there, I &s;aw but two Prie&s;ts, the Vicar of the Mona&s;tery was one; and the other, who had not &s;aid his fir&s;t Ma&s;s, was the Steward. All the others, that were &s;eventeen in number, were Lay-men, and almo&s;t all either with one eye,
<PB N="188" REF="98">deaf, lame, and halt, or worn out with old age; and if among&s;t them any were young, he did but &s;eek the opportunity to e&s;cape from &s;uch au&s;te|rities.</P>
<P>In the Tower, mentioned before, were three or &s;our Trunks full of old <HI>Arabian</HI> Manu&s;cripts, and &s;ome in the <HI>Copties</HI> Language, which I have per|us'd: And though they were all Books of De|votion belonging to the Church, &s;ome of them de&s;erved to be in the Kings Library; but be|cau&s;e the Monks were not willing to fell them, for they belong'd to the Mona&s;tery, fearing the Excommunication of their Patriarch, which is written in the beginning of every Book; and becau&s;e I had brought with me but &s;o much Mo|ney as was needful for my Journey, for fear of the Thieves, I was not very earne&s;t to buy them.</P>
<P>Two among&s;t the re&s;t were very curious, which I had a great de&s;ire to have; one was the <HI>Copties</HI> Grammar and Dictionary in
<HI>Arabick,</HI> of <HI>Ibn il a&s;&s;al.</HI> It was one of the exacte&s;t and lar|ge&s;t that ever I faw: They e&s;teem'd it worth thirty Crowns; I dare &s;ay, that with this Di|ctionary and Grammar it is po&s;&s;ible to re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h the <HI>Copties</HI> Language, which now is lo&s;t: The other Book was a <HI>Rubrick of their Ceremonies</HI> in <HI>Folio,</HI> very well written.</P>
<P>In regard the <HI>Arabians</HI> are the Ma&s;ters of the Wilderne&s;s, this Mona&s;tery is obliged to enter|tain all that come thither, or pa&s;s by, whether Friends or Foes: To their Friends they pay this ho&s;pitality to pre&s;erve their friend&s;hip, and to their Enemies they perform it, to plea&s;e them, and hinder them from doing them a mi&s;chief. They treat not all in the &s;ame manner; for their <PB N="189" REF="98">Friends they take them in with their Equipage, when they have need, and they nouri&s;h them all the time that they de&s;ire to live there; but their Enemies never enter in, but receive from them, by a Basket let down from the Wall, all nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>They are often vi&s;ited by the&s;e <HI>Arabians,</HI> &s;o that they &s;pend every year a great deal of Meal, of Bread, of Bisket, of Barly, of Beans and Lentils, and other Provi&s;ions. I &s;hall not mention the trouble that the Monks &s;uffer, and the di&s;plea|&s;ures that they receive from the&s;e ungrateful Wretches, who commonly recompen&s;e them with affronts, and filthy &s;peeches.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the <HI>Arabians</HI> that inhabit about
<HI>Egypt</HI> are of divers Families, and differing Intere&s;ts; they have &s;o great a hatred for one ano|ther, that they never meet without fighting.</P>
<P>Such a mi&s;chance happen'd the next day after my arrival; for the <HI>Caravan</HI> of the Summer, of fifty Camels, loaden with Provi&s;ions for the Mona&s;te|ry, led by thirteen Hor&s;men of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> named
<HI>Beneva&s;el,</HI> arrived that day. They were watched by other
<HI>Arabians,</HI> named <HI>Ababde,</HI> their Enemies. And becau&s;e it was the time that the Dates began to be ripe upon the Trees, &s;ome of them when they had unloaden would not return the &s;ame day, with their Companions, to their Vil|lages and Cabbins, but remain'd behind in the Mona&s;tery, to take their plea&s;ure a day or two. It happen'd the next night that tho&s;e that &s;lept out of the Mona&s;tery, about their Bea&s;ts, were &s;urpris'd at midnight, by a Company of three|&s;core <HI>Arabians,</HI> called
<HI>Ababde,</HI> who took from them fifteen Camels, and &s;even Hor&s;es, all their Equipage, and kill'd three of them, and wound|ed <PB N="190" REF="99">five, of whom one dyed within three days af|ter, and another was lo&s;t, none knowing what was become of him; for four days after his Hor&s;e was found alone in the Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Their fury ended not with this Butchery; for they pur&s;ued, with the &s;ame heat, tho&s;e that had brought me to the Mona&s;tery. They overtook but four, and carryed away from them their Ca|mels, all their Equipage, and Money that I had given them, and wounded three very dangerou&s;|ly; &s;o that the&s;e Wretches being not able, in this &s;ad condition, to proceed on in their Journey, they return'd back to the Mona&s;tery all naked, and in a pitiful manner. They were afraid to appear before me, becau&s;e they had fal&s;ified their Faith, contrary to the Laws of their Nation, and broken their agreement with me, in making me pay five and twenty <HI>Meidins</HI> more than I had a|greed with them. Their Con&s;cience did re|proach them of this ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;o that they imagin'd that this mi&s;chance happen'd to them to puni&s;h their perfideou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ufficiently expre&s;s how much trouble this unhappine&s;s created me, as well as to the Monks; for the&s;e
<HI>Arabians</HI> were enraged, &s;ome for the lo&s;s of their Parents and Friends, others for their Goods, which they were re&s;olved to re|cover upon me and the Monks. They threatned to kill them, to plunder the Mona&s;tery; and out of a per&s;wa&s;ion that I was a very rich <HI>Franc,</HI> they threatned to break open my Door, and carry a|way all that I had. So that the Monks had much ado to pacifie them, by giving the Shirts, Cloaths, Caps, Girdles, in a word, all that they wanted; and when they had nothing more left to give&punc;
<PB N="191" REF="99">they came to me, intreating me to help them in their need; &s;o that I was oblig'd to give them a Coat, and a Shirt to bury an
<HI>Arabian</HI> that dyed in the Mona&s;tery. I gave them a red Cap, a Tur|ban, Money very often, that I might not be be|tray'd by tho&s;e Monks who deliver'd all to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> without telling them from whence it came.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t the <HI>Arabians</HI> were jealous, when they &s;aw that I continued &s;hut up, without &s;hewing my &s;elf abroad, either to them, or any other of the Mona&s;tery; and my privacy made them believe that I was &s;ome great Per&s;on that was afraid of them. They re&s;olved therefore to give me a vi|&s;it, to know who I was. As &s;oon as the Vicar un|der&s;tood their intent, he came to give me notice of it, that I might take a cour&s;e accordingly. As &s;oon as I under&s;tood it, I cau&s;ed all my Goods to be carried into the Tower of the Mona&s;tery, leaving nothing in my Chamber but a cour&s;e Mat of Palm Leaves &s;tretched upon the Floor, upon which I &s;ate without Carpet or Cu&s;hion: And that they might not think me to be a
<HI>Franc,</HI> I took the Habit of a Monk of that Convent. In this manner I expected them, not without fear. The next day about noon, three of the chief enter'd into my Chamber with their <HI>Cangians,</HI> or
<HI>Cutla&s;&s;es,</HI> at their Girdle in their Bo&s;oms. They &s;aluted me with a &s;urly look, asking how I did. I an&s;wer'd their civility as well as I could; I cau&s;ed them to &s;it down near me, and told them that I was griev|ed at their misfortune, and that I was not able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their need. I exhorted them to tru&s;t upon God and S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who was as well their Father and Protector, as of the Monks; <PB N="192" REF="100">and that doubtle&s;s he would comfort them, and give them one day the opportunity to overcome their Enemies. The&s;e words plea&s;ed the <HI>Ara|bians</HI> mightily.</P>
<P>I caus'd my Dinner to be brought, and though I had with me all my Provi&s;ions needful from <HI>Cairo,</HI> I &s;uffered nothing to be brought but Len|tils in a Wooden Di&s;h, with Bread &s;oaked in it, and a few Onions, I intreated them to eat &s;ome with me: They needed not much invitation. One may imagine what was in my mind, when I had &s;uch Gue&s;s at my Table; but fear cau&s;ed me to di&s;&s;emble my thoughts.</P>
<P>After Dinner I gave them Pipes to take Tobac|co, and Coffee according to the Mode of the Country, which plea&s;ed them well, chiefly in this place where little of that Drink was to be &s;een. When the&s;e
<HI>Arabians</HI> &s;aw me &s;o free and hearty, they conceived &s;uch an affection for me, that they promis'd to protect me, if any of their Comrades &s;hould offer to affront me. When they had talked with me &s;ome hours, they went away very well &s;a|tisfied, and told their Comrades how civil I had been. By this one may under&s;tand, that there is no Nation in the World &s;o barbarous; but is to be won by fair means.</P>
<P>Some days before; the <HI>Arabians</HI> had &s;ent &s;ome of their Company to their Parents, to inform them of their lo&s;s, and to intreat them to &s;end them Bea&s;ts to help home their &s;ick and wounded. That day they received an an&s;wer, that &s;uch of them as could return home on foot &s;hould ven|ture, but that the others &s;hould continue there till they were cured of their wounds; and that none dur&s;t come, or &s;end them Bea&s;ts, for fear of lo&s;ing <PB N="193" REF="100">them. Therefore the&s;e Wretches when they &s;aw that they could not remain any longer in the Mo|na&s;tery, re&s;olved to depart together, as &s;oon as their &s;ick Per&s;ons &s;hould recover any &s;trength. I re&s;olved al&s;o to be gone; for the little &s;atisfacti|on that I found there, took away all de&s;ire to con|tinue there any longer; for I had cau&s;e to fear, le&s;t the news of this Ma&s;&s;acre &s;hould &s;pread about the Wilderne&s;s, which might have cau&s;ed me to &s;tay there all the Winter, for want of an oppor|tunity to carry me away. I ha&s;ten'd therefore my departure as much as I could, and hired three Camels of an <HI>Arabian</HI> that was left behind in the Mona&s;tery, who alone was able to furni&s;h us: I was to give him a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> and a half a-piece; moreover I promis'd to give him a new Suit of Apparel for an <HI>Arabian</HI> of our Company that had been &s;tripp'd, who&s;e Kin&s;man he &s;aid he was: We confirm'd our Agreement before all the Monks, by the Chapter of <HI>Fatha,</HI> according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country; and then I cau&s;ed my &s;elf to be let down from the Window of the Mona&s;tery, on <HI>Munday</HI> the 17th of
<HI>October,</HI> leav|ing with joy a place where I had met with many di&s;plea&s;ures. We took the way and road of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> or the under way, becau&s;e the Camels that I had hired lived that way. The
<HI>Arabian</HI> that was to be my Guide having but one in the Mona&s;tery, the two others being near his Lodg|ing, which was in a Clift of Mount <HI>Gebel il che|leil,</HI> over again&s;t the Mona&s;tery. We went to this Lodging, or about a days travelling from thence, in a way very difficult and deep; and becau&s;e this <HI>Arabian</HI> was a right Devil of the Mountains, as they term them&s;elves in boa&s;ting. <PB N="194" REF="101">As &s;oon as we were a little forwards in our way, he told me that the Price that we had agreed up|on was not &s;ufficient, and that I mu&s;t promi&s;e him as much more. I refu&s;ed to grant him his de&s;ire, which was contrary to all rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, he led us therefore two days up and down in the Wilderne&s;s, &s;ometimes one way, &s;ometimes a|nother, threatning to leave us and go away with his Camel, or to carry us back to the Mona&s;tery: all this was to force me to give him what he de|manded. I had much difficulty to hold my hands from &s;triking him, which I had done, had we but known the way, and where to recover Water; but con&s;idering that I was lo&s;t if I did abu&s;e him, I was forced at la&s;t to con&s;ent to his de&s;ire, upon this Condition, that he &s;hould remain at home and give us another Per&s;on to guide us in our way; for he was of &s;uch a crooked di&s;po&s;ition that it was impo&s;&s;ible to perform the Journey peaceably with him, which accordingly he did. When we had thus &s;atisfied him, he became of a good hu|mour and led us to his Dwelling, where his Wife and Children came to &s;ee us, and prepared for us a Supper, according to the Mode of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> his Boys brought us &s;ome Wild-Fowl, and pre|&s;ented me with a young Fawn alive, which I car|ried with me to
<HI>Cairo.</HI> Thus we &s;pent that night very plea&s;antly.</P>
<P>The next day we cau&s;ed him to repeat the <HI>Fatha</HI> the &s;econd time. He gave us a <HI>Moor</HI> to conduct us, of a very good humour. We went with him on our way, and arrived at <HI>Bei&s;a</HI> the 22th of
<HI>Octo|ber,</HI> from whence we had been ab&s;ent 22 days. I pa&s;&s;ed immediately over to the other &s;ide of <HI>Ni|lus</HI> to <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> and lodg'd under a Tent, with a <PB N="195" REF="101"><HI>Turk</HI> my very good Friend, on the &s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> till the 26th of
<HI>October.</HI> I went aboard then to return to <HI>Cairo,</HI> where I landed the next day, ha|ving &s;pent 31 days in my Travels from thence.</P>
<P>I never undertook any Journey, or Voyage, that was &s;o full of accidents, and cro&s;&s;es, as this.</P>
<P>The conveniency of a Guide cau&s;ed me to un|dertake it. He was a young <HI>Aby&s;&s;in,</HI> of my Age, named <HI>Paul,</HI> a comly Per&s;on, wi&s;e and devout in appearance. I had a little before got acquain|tance with him; and becau&s;e he under&s;tood by my di&s;cour&s;e, that I had a great de&s;ire to vi&s;it the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> where he &s;aid he had been before, and that I expected but a Guide, becau&s;e the ways were difficult for a <HI>Franc</HI> who had never been there, chiefly becau&s;e of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> a bruti&s;h and fanta&s;tick People, he of|fered his &s;ervice to accompany me thither. And the rather I accepted his offer; becau&s;e I have al|ways had a particular re&s;pect for the hone&s;t Men of his Country.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved therefore upon all the Circum|&s;tances of our Journey, and left <HI>Cairo</HI> the day mentioned before. But the familiarity ordinary among&s;t fellow Travellers di&s;covered to me his di&s;po&s;ition and temper, more than I could before; for all his vi&s;its at <HI>Cairo</HI> were &s;tudied and crafty. I found therefore that he was a di&s;&s;embler, and without judgment, too ha&s;ty; I re&s;olved therefore to &s;hake him off, and to &s;eek another, to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that his indi&s;cretion might procure tome.</P>
<P>I met at <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> very happily, a <HI>Coptie</HI> born at <HI>Bu&s;ch,</HI> by Profe&s;&s;ion a <HI>Meba&s;cier,</HI> or Arithme|tician, who had travell'd all about the upper <HI>E|gypt.</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="102">I found him fit for my turn, I ask'd him to be my Guide in this Voyage; he accepted of the offer, and I paid him beforehand. When the
<HI>A|by&s;&s;in</HI> under&s;tood it, he was highly offended; &s;o that he endeavour'd afterwards to be reveng'd, by cau&s;ing a di&s;turbance among&s;t us, which an|ger'd the Company again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night after our departure from <HI>Bene|&s;uef,</HI> when we lay in the Wilderne&s;s, he com|manded my Servant, contrary to my orders, to give no Coffee to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> as if a Di&s;h of Cof|fee, given to the&s;e Wretches, would have im|poveri&s;h'd me. They plotted to cut his Throat, and doubtle&s;s he had there ended his days, had I not perceived it betimes and &s;atisfied them; for as they are extreme bruti&s;h when they are an|ger'd, they are very quiet when they are flat|ter'd and kindly us'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> caus'd me, again&s;t their wills, to &s;uffer another inconveniency. They took no care when they greas'd the Leathern Bottles of Water, that the Grea&s;e was mouldy, it infected therefore the Water &s;o much which we were to drink, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly ta&s;te of it: let any Man think if this was not a &s;ufficient mortificati|on, &s;eeing our Journey, or Voyage, la&s;ted five days.</P>
<P>As this was the fir&s;t time that I rid upon a Ca|mel, I could hardly endure the &s;hakings, which the manner of walking of this fanta&s;tick Bea&s;t cau&s;ed me to &s;uffer. I confe&s;s, when I &s;aw my &s;elf upon this Colo&s;&s;us, without any &s;tay, lifted up in the Air, &s;eated upon an ugly Bea&s;t; my Feet in two Ropes in&s;tead of Stirrups, holding in my hand a Cord made with the Strings of a Palm-tree, <PB N="197" REF="102">which cut my hands, it &s;eemed to me very &s;trange: I re&s;olved neverthele&s;s to overcome all the&s;e difficulties; and in&s;tead of vexing my &s;elf, I made a &s;port of that which would have troubled other Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>When I think upon the &s;olemn reception of the Monks, when I fir&s;t came into the Mona&s;tery, I cannot but be yet di&s;pleas'd at my
<HI>Aby&s;&s;in.</HI> This Fool de&s;ired me to let him go before the
<HI>Caravan,</HI> to tell the Monks of my coming, and to cau&s;e a Chamber to be prepared for me; but by the re|&s;pects they paid me, I under&s;tood that he had too much exaggerated my quality, thinking to do me a plea&s;ure. I indeavoured to undeceive them, and cau&s;ed all their Ceremonies to cea&s;e, as &s;oon as I perceived that they took me for a greater Per|&s;on than really I was.</P>
<P>I have already &s;et down at large how the
<HI>Ara|b&iuml;ans</HI> frighted me in the Mona&s;tery; but they were not the only Per&s;ons that troubled me. The Monks, the Vicars, the <HI>Copties,</HI> and the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> vex'd me one after another, as if they had all a|greed to try my patience.</P>
<P>The avaricious Monks, not contented with what I had given them, before my departure cau&s;|ed their Vicar to tell me, that they expected that a
<HI>Franc</HI> of my reputation would have left them at lea&s;t thirty golden
<HI>Ducats</HI> of <HI>Venice.</HI> When I told them of the great charges I had been at in this Voyage, be&s;ides the expences that I was yet to be at in my return; that I had received but lit|tle &s;atisfaction from them; that I wonder'd at their boldne&s;s, to tax a Stranger of my quality, that came from far to &s;ee their mi&s;erable Mona|&s;tery, and their poverty. They were angry at <PB N="198" REF="103">this an&s;wer, and treated me afterwards with contempt.</P>
<P>The Vicar was afraid to want Bread in his Mona&s;tery; therefore he re&s;olved to quit it, and to &s;eek another where he might be better treat|ed: And becau&s;e he had no money to hire a Camel to carry him through a tedious and trouble&s;ome way, he intreated me to give him &s;ome, which I did very generou&s;ly, though I had cau&s;e to be offended with him. But he put this money in his Pur&s;e, without dreaming of hiring a Camel, be|lieving that my men would &s;uffer him to ride &s;ometimes upon their Camels: But in the way he found him&s;elf deceived; when he was wea|ry, and his feet cut with the &s;harp &s;tones, he mur|mured at me; I told him of his covetou&s;ne&s;s, unworthy of a man of his Profe&s;&s;ion, of his lit|tle love for his Flock, whom he left in the time when they needed mo&s;t his Fatherly care, but he received the&s;e reproofs very ill; &s;o that from thence it may ea&s;ily be imagin'd, how we tra|vell'd together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI> and the <HI>Coptie</HI> were at a continual variance, becau&s;e one thought him&s;elf more u&s;e|ful to me than the other; &s;o that at every foot, I was oblig'd to make peace between them.</P>
<P>The night before the <HI>Arabians</HI> vi&s;ited me, I was oblig'd to cau&s;e all my Cloaths to be carri|ed into the Tower of the Mona&s;tery, into a &s;e|cure place. In that hurley-burley I lo&s;t &s;ome, valued at five or &s;ix <HI>Pia&s;ters;</HI> I cannot tell who&s;e fault it was, the <HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI> ca&s;t the fault upon the <HI>Coptie,</HI> to di&s;credit him with me: However, as &s;oon as we were come to <HI>Beiha,</HI> the <HI>Coptie</HI> vani&s;h'd away &s;uddenly, without bidding us farewell.
<PB N="199" REF="103">This cau&s;ed me to &s;u&s;pect that the
<HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI> had not accu&s;ed him wrongfully.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e di&s;plea&s;ures we mu&s;t add the fear of Thieves in the way; for at every &s;tep, we look'd on the ground to &s;ee whether there were any foot&s;teps in the Sand; when we &s;aw &s;ome that were fre&s;h, we were then grievou&s;ly afraid; but our apprehen&s;ions increa&s;ed, when we &s;aw the foot&s;teps turned our way, for we imagin'd that we &s;hould meet them; fear alone made us take Bea&s;ts at a di&s;tance for Men, and Bu&s;hes for Robbers that waited for us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we were in &s;ight of <HI>Beiha,</HI> we imagin'd then that all our fears were over; but the Ca|mels knowing the Fields where they were wont to feed, began to leap for joy, becau&s;e they were return'd to their ordinary Pa&s;tures; &s;o that the Saddle of that upon which I rid being not well girded, nor the Bridle &s;ufficient to &s;top the Bea&s;t, it jolted, and ca&s;t me up into the Air &s;eve|ral times: at every moment I thought I &s;hould tumble down, and break my Neck, which hap|pen'd not, through the care of the <HI>Arabian</HI> that &s;topt the Camel.</P>
<P>This Relation is &s;ufficient to make it appear, that if there is &s;ome plea&s;ure in travelling, and &s;eeing Forreign Curio&s;ities, one buys them very dear, with the hazard of many dangers and cro&s;|&s;es, chiefly in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where cruelty and barba|ri&s;m &s;eem to dwell.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add &s;ome other Curio&s;ities which I have &s;een in the De&s;arts.</P>
<P>We left at our left hand when we came from the Mona&s;teries, the ruines of a very ancient Town, &s;cituate on the top of the barren Moun|tain, <PB N="200" REF="104">called, <HI>Gebel il cheleil.</HI> This Town is in the mid-way between <HI>Beiha</HI> and the Mona&s;tery, in that place where the Mountain &s;eparates it &s;elf, and by which one pa&s;&s;eth in coming or going from <HI>Beiha,</HI> in the way of the <HI>Caravan.</HI> The
<HI>A|rabians</HI> were ignorant of the name, and we had no time to &s;tay there, having taken notice upon the Sand, of fre&s;h foot&s;teps of Hor&s;e-men that had pa&s;&s;ed that way, which cau&s;ed us to conceive &s;ome danger, if we continued there any time.</P>
<P>I found there a Plant, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call
<HI>Barnub:</HI> It hath a little full Stalk, as a <HI>Mouche|ron,</HI> and at the top a little Butron, about the big|ne&s;s of a Nut, which is full of Powder, which the <HI>Dyers</HI> u&s;e in dying. Its leaves are as &s;lender as the leaves of Poppy; I gathered three or four of the&s;e Plants, but I could not keep them long, becau&s;e of their tenderne&s;s. I &s;aw al&s;o an Herb which is called by the <HI>Arabians Rabl,</HI> that &s;mells as <HI>Mint,</HI> my <HI>Arabians</HI> fed upon it. I &s;aw there a great deal of
<HI>Alcali,</HI> called in <HI>Arab. Kilu,</HI> which hath the virtue to take away from Cloaths all manner of &s;pots. Upon the Mount <HI>Colzim,</HI> there is a Wood that grows, called <HI>Oud il akrab,</HI> or <HI>Scorpions Wood,</HI> the Monks of S. <HI>Anthony</HI> reduced it to powder, which they judge to be a good re|medy again&s;t the biting of venomous Creatures, as well as to cure weak eyes, and eyes inflamed: They gave me half a pound in Canes; I have &s;ent it to <HI>Paris</HI> with the other Curio&s;ities. In this De&s;art is a great deal of <HI>Coloquinte,</HI> and un|der the Sand much white &s;alt very good, which my <HI>Arabians</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ea&s;on their <HI>Fatir,</HI> and their
<HI>Mafruca.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fatir</HI> are great Cakes, as thick as finger, and
<PB N="201" REF="104">as large as a <HI>French</HI> Hat, baked in the Coals.</P>
<P><HI>Mafruca</HI> is made of the <HI>Fatir,</HI> by breaking it in pieces, when it is yet hot, and taken from the fire; and by pouring upon it Oyl-Olive, and kneading it with the hand in a wooden di&s;h, as if it were Pa&s;te. My <HI>Arabians</HI> imagin'd to do me a great plea&s;ure to offer me &s;ome to eat, for this is highly e&s;teem'd among&s;t them; but though I had a good Stomach, I had not the courage to ta&s;te of it, for I had good cau&s;e to loath it.</P>
<P>I return now to &s;peak of the things that hap|pen'd at
<HI>Cairo,</HI> where I landed the 30th of <HI>O|ctober.</HI></P>
<P>That day they began the <HI>Zine,</HI> or <HI>Fe&s;tival of publick joy,</HI> becau&s;e the Grand Seignior had taken <HI>Caminiez</HI> from the <HI>Poles.</HI> This Fe&s;tival la&s;ted from <HI>Sunday</HI> till
<HI>Thur&s;day</HI> in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom at <HI>Cairo,</HI> that in &s;uch like Fe|&s;tivals every one adorns the out-&s;ide of his Hou&s;e or Shop with Carpets and Pavillions, lighting a|bout them all night many Lamps tyed to wooden Engines, &s;ome made in an <HI>Hexagone</HI> figure, o|thers in an
<HI>Octogone;</HI> &s;ome as Stars, others in a|nother manner. The&s;e Engines are &s;u&s;pended with Ropes tyed cro&s;s the Streets, which are beautiful to look upon. The Streets in all other times are &s;hut in the night, but then are open, and the Chri&s;tians, during this Fe&s;tival, may walk about more freely than at other times at mid-day, becau&s;e one cannot di&s;tingui&s;h in that ob&s;cure light of what colour is the Turbant that they wear, nor di&s;cover whether it be &s;traked, or all white.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Lamps and Carpets, the <HI>Beys</HI> hang up in a good order before their Palaces up|on <PB N="202" REF="105">the Walls; their mo&s;t beautiful Armour, as Head-pieces, Brea&s;t-plates, Coats of Male, Mu&s;|quets, Hangers, Targets, and other &s;uch In&s;tru|ments of War. The
<HI>French</HI> Con&s;uls, who never come &s;hort of them, cau&s;e beautiful Carpets to be hung in all the Streets of their dwellings, and Pavillions over the Streets, from one end to ano|ther, to keep off the heat of the Sun. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tyger,</HI> Con&s;ul of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, cau&s;ed a kind of a re&s;ting place to be erected, beautifying it with Carpets and Cu&s;hions, to receive the Per|&s;ons of Quality; he put round about the Pictures of the King, of the Queen, of the Dolphin, and other <HI>French</HI> Lords, in &s;mall ingravery, with Ta|pers before them, to cau&s;e the
<HI>Turks</HI> to admire the wit and invention of the <HI>French,</HI> who can make Pictures much like the Originals. But the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;urprized to &s;ee their Beards &s;haven off; they ask'd whether they were yet Chil|dren.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fe&s;tivals give much diver&s;ion to the people, but they are very chargeable to tho&s;e that will ob&s;erve them, chiefly to the Con&s;uls; for be&s;ides the Tents and Carpets, and other Or|naments that they mu&s;t hire, they are wont to give Coffee and Tobacco to all that come to &s;ee them; and if they be per&s;ons of Quality, they mu&s;t have Sweet-meats: &s;o that if a Con&s;ul will come off with Honour, it will co&s;t him three or four hundred Crowns. The people run about the Streets, from morning till three hours after mid-night, all the time of the Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> I went to &s;ee the Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Cairo</HI> with a <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> a very good friend of mine.</P>
<PB N="203" REF="105">
<P>The fir&s;t thing that we &s;aw was the Royal Hall, where the
<HI>Pacha</HI> keeps the <HI>Divan.</HI> He &s;hewed me in the middle of this Hall, a great Cord tyed double to one of the Beams of the Roof, where, according to the cu&s;tom of the Country, the <HI>Ca&s;ciefs</HI> that have not &s;ufficient to pay the Taxes of their Province, at the end of the year are lift|ed up in the air, with their hands behind, tyed to their backs: be&s;ides, they are whipt upon their naked backs with a Whip of Cords, where|unto are tyed &s;ome Leaden Bullets.</P>
<P>We went up next to the top of the Ovens where they bake Bread, from whence the place called <HI>Kara,</HI> or the place of exerci&s;e, is di&s;co|verable. There the <HI>Pacha</HI>'s men &s;port them&s;elves with Bows and Arrows, and by running on Hor&s;e-back, aiming at a mark fixed at the top of a very high Tree.</P>
<P>We went to &s;ee next the Chambers where they make the Gun-powder, which are two great Par|lours or Rooms on the ground, over again&s;t the Royal Hall of the <HI>Divan,</HI> with very &s;trong walls, and vaulted over head. In each are twelve Mor|tars of Pewter placed round, about a Cubit high, with their Pe&s;tels of Iron, which receive their motion, to pound the matter in the Mortars to powder, from a long Pole that an&s;wers to a Beam that &s;tands in the middle of the Chamber, which a Hor&s;e turns round. There are near &s;e|veral other Chambers, where are many little Mortars, in which they refine the Gun-powder.</P>
<P>On the 19th of <HI>November</HI> I was pre&s;ent at a Marriage of two <HI>Copties;</HI> the Ceremonies were performed in this manner.</P>
<P>After the Oration or Prayer of mid-night, or
<PB N="204" REF="106">as if we &s;hould &s;ay, after Morning-prayer, the Friends and Parents led fir&s;t the Bridegroom, and next the Bride, from their Hou&s;es to the Church, with &s;everal lighted Tapers before them, and &s;inging through the Streets Hymns in the <HI>Copties</HI> Language, and &s;triking with little wooden Hammers again&s;t &s;ome &s;ticks of Ebony wood, which is their Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>When they were come to the Church, they led the Bridegroom into the inner Chancel, where u&s;ually the Prayers are &s;aid, and brought the Bride to the place of the Women: Then the Prie&s;ts and the People began in the Chancel their Prayers mingled with Hymns, which la&s;ted very long: At the end, he that performed the Ceremony of the Marriage, went to the Bride|groom and read three or four Prayers, making over him the Sign of the Cro&s;s, before, and at the end of every Prayer. He cau&s;ed him after|wards to &s;it on the ground, having his face turn|ed towards the <HI>Heikel,</HI> holding behind him upon his Head, in a &s;tanding po&s;ture, a Silver Cro&s;s, and continuing in Prayer.</P>
<P>Whiles this was doing in the Chancel, the Beadle cau&s;ed the Bride, with one of her Kin|dred, to &s;it down upon a Bench that he had there put out of the door of the uttermo&s;t Chancel. As &s;oon as the Prie&s;ts had ended in the innermo&s;t Chancel, the <HI>prayers of the Knot,</HI> as they name them. He that performed the Ceremony, cloa|thed the Bridegroom with a Surplice, and tyed him about the middle with a Girdle, putting up|on his head a white Cloth.</P>
<P>In this manner he led him to the Bride, cau|&s;ing him to &s;it by her: He then covered them <PB N="205" REF="106">both with this white Cloth, and made them put their heads together. Then he anointed the Bridegroom with Oyl-Olive in the Forehead, and above the Fi&s;t, and the Bride in the &s;ame manner: Afterwards he cau&s;ed them to give one another their hands, reading aloud the Exhorta|tion that contains the Duties which they were to perform to one another. So with a long train of Prayers, interrupted with &s;everal Ceremo|nies, this Solemnity of Marriage ended, which they call the
<HI>Coronation of the Married Couple.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards they read Morning-prayer, or as we call them, the
<HI>Laudes.</HI> They &s;ung next Ma&s;s, where the Bridegroom and the Bride received the Communion; which being ended, they all returned to their &s;everal homes.</P>

<HEAD>The beginning of the Year <HI>1673.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE night of the 16th of <HI>January,</HI> 1673. the
<HI>Copties</HI> celebrate the Fe&s;tival of the <HI>E|piphany.</HI> I was then at <HI>Cairo</HI> in the Church of <HI>Ma|ry Moncure,</HI> to &s;ee how they dip them&s;elves in Wa|ter in remembrance of the Bapti&s;m of our Lord and Saviour, which was performed that night according to the Traditions of the Church. I took notice of the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P>They &s;aid the Prayers of Midnight, where the Font &s;tands, and where they dipped them&s;elves, which they call <HI>il Magtas.</HI> This Pond, or Ba&s;on: of Water is in a Chamber near the Church, about three Perches &s;quare, as deep as a Man is high. As &s;oon as Prayers were ended, the Patriarch went to the <HI>Kolomie,</HI> or <HI>Ve&s;try,</HI> to put on his Pon|tifical <PB N="206" REF="107">Attire; from thence he return'd to the Water, with a Deacon and a Prie&s;t before him. The Deacon had on him a Cape, bearing in his hand an Iron Cro&s;s, as long as a Pa&s;toral Staff. The Prie&s;t was Cloathed with a Surplice, that he might be u&s;eful to the Patriarch in &s;aying of Ma&s;s; that is, that he might be his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies.</P>
<P>When he was come to the Water, he began to ble&s;s it, by reading over it &s;everal Le&s;&s;ons taken out of the Prophets and the P&s;alms, and out of the New Te&s;tament; &s;ometimes in the <HI>Copties</HI> Language, &s;ometimes in <HI>Arabick.</HI> The Patri|arch perfum'd it al&s;o, and &s;tirr'd it cro&s;s-wi&s;e with the Pa&s;toral Staff of Iron, which the other Prie&s;ts did al&s;o, every one in his turn. And whil&s;t they were ble&s;&s;ing this Water, which la&s;ted near two hours, there was a Candle&s;tick of Iron &s;tanding within, about the length of a Man, with three Branches, upon which there were three Tapers burning all the time of this Ceremony.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this ble&s;&s;ing was ended, the Pond, or Ba&s;on, was all uncovered, that the People might go in and dip them&s;elves. Then there was heard a &s;trange confu&s;ion and noi&s;e, &s;o great that I won|der'd; for every one endeavoured to be one of the three fir&s;t, whom the Patriarch dips in the Wa|ter. They that could not obtain this honour, dipp'd them&s;elves, skipping and playing, all na|ked, in the Water, without having any thing to cover their nakedne&s;s, and privy Members; and all this in the pre&s;ence of their Patriarch, and many Prie&s;ts that were there.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Men had ended their wa&s;hing, and were gone to the Chancel; the Women, and <PB N="207" REF="107">the Maids drew near, and followed the Mens Ex|ample, skipping all naked in the Water, and &s;port|ting one with the other. It is true that &s;uch as did thus dip them&s;elves were of the poorer &s;ort, and that as many as were of the wealthier, and better &s;ort, wa&s;h'd their faces and hands.</P>
<P>When the Women had ended their bathing, they went away to their own places to hear Ma&s;s, which was already begun.</P>
<P>Thus this Ceremony was performed, which I &s;aw from the beginning to the end.</P>
<P>The 26th of this Month Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Tyger,</HI> who had been, till then, Con&s;ul of the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion, left <HI>Cairo.</HI> He is a very able Man, and un|der&s;tands his duty very well; but the Merchants of <HI>France</HI> made their complaints again&s;t him at Court, and caus'd him to be di&s;mi&s;s'd.

The&s;e Letters were very great, Embroidered with Gold, and artificially In|terwoven. <PB N="208" REF="108">The&s;e <HI>Burying-Cloaths</HI> were each car|ried upon a Bier, made almo&s;t in die &s;ame fa&s;hion as tho&s;e that are in <HI>Europe,</HI> and they were about three Perches long.</P>
<P>An infinite number of <HI>Schiechs,</HI> or Eccle&s;ia|&s;ticks, followed after in a confu&s;ion, cau&s;ing &s;e|veral Banners to be carried before them, which had been taken out of the Mo&s;ques of <HI>Cairo:</HI> Some were on foot, others riding upon A&s;&s;es, and all cloathed in a very &s;trange manner, with Garbs made up with divers pieces of many colours patched together. They cau&s;ed them&s;elves to be wondered at by their howling and grimaces, for they wagg'd their Heads, their Eyes, and their Mouths, in a thou&s;and ways; others pro|nounced the word <HI>Hu,</HI> which is one of the Attri|butes and Names of God, with all the &s;trength of their body; and there was none without Ar|mour, a Club, or a Halberd, or a wooden Sword, or &s;ome other ru&s;ty Weapon.</P>
<P>After this Crowd came the Cloth with which they cover
<HI>Mahomets</HI> Tomb, which they call in <HI>Arabick, il Mahmel.</HI> It was carried upon a Ca|mel painted yellow, with an Herb called <HI>Henne,</HI> and very richly harna&s;&s;ed and trapped with gold Embroidery, with feathers upon the Head, and about the Neck and Legs little Bells.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mahmel</HI> was made like a Bed, but the kind of Stuff, and the colour, was not to be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd, becau&s;e it was all covered with Flowers, and <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters, very long, all Embroi|dered with Gold and Interwoven very artificially. At the four corners were four great

Eight and twenty <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> went next, two and two, with their Caps upon their heads.

His Dome&s;ticks, who were twelve Archers well cloathed, and a Troop of Mu&s;queteers on Hor&s;es, waited upon him; after followed the Drummers, the Trumpeters, the Pipers, either on Hor&s;eback, or riding upon Ca|mels; and at la&s;t there was an Engine, drawn by the &s;trength of Men, upon which was repre|&s;entented the Porch of the Temple of
<HI>Mecha,</HI> in green Sattin Embroidered with Gold: They call it <HI>Arab. Burca.</HI></P>
<P>The Money needful to make all the&s;e Cloaths,
<PB N="210" REF="109">is taken out of the Revenues of the Lands which the ancient Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> have appointed for that purpo&s;e, which hath been confirmed by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours.

<P>That which was worthy of notice in this Pomp, was the blind Devotion of the&s;e Wretches for the things which are to be u&s;ed by their Prophet, or employed in their Religion. All the People, notwith&s;tanding the extraordinary crowd in all the Streets where the&s;e Cloaths were to pa&s;s, pre&s;|&s;ed forward with incredible earne&s;tne&s;s, that they might cau&s;e their Handkerchiefs, or their <HI>Turbans,</HI> to touch the&s;e Cloaths that were de&s;igned for the Tomb of their Prophet, which they ki&s;s'd after|wards, and rubb'd them upon their Eyes with much devotion.</P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> in the morning, whiles our Boat-men were bu&s;ie in freeing the Boat, I went to &s;ee the City of <HI>Minie,</HI> &s;cituate on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nilus,</HI> belonging to the
<HI>Ca&s;cieflik</HI> of <HI>Behne&s;e.</HI> I went al|&s;o into the
<HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> without fear, becau&s;e I was cloathed in a
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit. When our Boat-men had freed the Bark, they drew her up to <HI>Minie,</HI> for we &s;ail'd upwards; there I went on board to go towards <HI>Melave.</HI></P>
<P>About an hours &s;ailing from <HI>Minie,</HI> we began to di&s;cover on the top of the Mountain, which lies at the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> the Caves. This, in my judgment, is the beginning of the Country of
<HI>Thebes:</HI> They are to be &s;een along the Mountain, as far as
<HI>Momfallot;</HI> I counted four and thirty in a rank, but the Mouths of the Caves were &s;topped up with Earth that was fallen in.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, we pa&s;s'd by the Ruines of the An|cient City <HI>In&s;ine,</HI> leaving it at our left hand, and at night we went to lie before <HI>Melave.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ailed away on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> morning, the &s;e|cond of <HI>March,</HI> and we &s;aw in our way many Caves in the Mountain, which is at the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> At Noon we left the great Channel of <HI>Nilus,</HI> becau&s;e there was but little water, and we enter'd into one of its Branches, which makes an I&s;land, by meeting again with the great Stream. We pa&s;s'd
<PB N="216" REF="112">before the Mouth of the River of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> of which I have &s;poken &s;ufficiently in the de&s;crip|tion of

<P><HI>Friday</HI> morning, the third day of the month, we landed at <HI>Momfallot,</HI> where I lodged in an Hou&s;e called <HI>Ocalet Emir Otman,</HI> or the dwel|ling of <HI>Prince Otman,</HI> which is in the Market|place. It is an old dwelling much decayed, and though there is another more beautiful, and more commodious, I would not lodge in it, that I might not &s;uffer the affronts of the <HI>Jam&s;&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Spa|hins,</HI> who lodg'd there, and who would have in|&s;ulted over me, had they known me to be a

<HI>Egypt.</HI> There is made much Linen-cloth: A great many Chri&s;tian
<HI>Cop|ties</HI> live here, but they have no Church.</P>
<P>The name of this Town &s;ignifies in <HI>Arabick</HI> the
<HI>Exile of Lot,</HI> becau&s;e a certain <HI>Lot</HI> was bani&s;h'd thither by his Brother, an ancient King of <HI>E|gypt,</HI> as the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay. Over again&s;t, on the o|ther &s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> are the &s;igns of an ancient Town, I could never under&s;tand the name.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Bene&s;uef</HI> there are two days journeys by Land; and by water, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s, according to the wind; from <HI>Bene&s;uef</HI> to <HI>Minie,</HI> are three days journeys by Land, from <HI>Minie</HI> to <HI>Melave</HI> is a little days journey, from <HI>Melave</HI> to <HI>Momfallot</HI> is a little more than a days journey, chiefly when the Hor&s;e is not good; and from <HI>Momfallot</HI> one may go and dine at <HI>Siut,</HI> if one takes the morning.</P>

<P>This Church was afterwards overthrown by the <HI>Doveider,</HI> a Branch of <HI>Nilus</HI> artificially made, which wa&s;hed the Walls; now there remains no|thing but the Altar, upon which the Bi&s;hop &s;ays Ma&s;s after a re-con&s;ecration.</P>

<HEAD>A Voyage to the <HI>White</HI> Mona&s;tery.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAturday,</HI> the 18th of this Month, I went very early from <HI>Tahta,</HI> towards the famous Mona|&s;tery of S. <HI>Sennodius,</HI> &s;irnamed the <HI>White,</HI> about a good days Journey from <HI>Tahta.</HI> The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Siut</HI> gave me one of his <HI>Arabians,</HI> named

<P>When we drew near him, he came to us, and &s;topt me bluntly, telling me that I mu&s;t alight. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed with this affront, and vexed that without cau&s;e I was to lo&s;e my Bea&s;t, I &s;eem'd to be re&s;olved not to alight; we continued a pretty while to di&s;pute together, till I &s;aw him lift up his Hatchet, which he wore at his Girdle, to cleave my head in two, and that my <HI>Arabian</HI> look'd idly upon us, as unconcern'd, I was forced to yield him my A&s;s; upon which he got imme|diately, and rode away.</P>
<P>I returned to the Town, on foot, to the Bi|&s;hop, who under&s;tanding my misfortune, cau&s;ed another to be given me. I went on in my way, and at our going out of <HI>Tahta,</HI> we pa&s;s'd by the Ruines of the ancient Town of <HI>Beneviet;</HI> we le&s;t at our left hand other &s;igns of an ancient Town, called <HI>Po&s;one;</HI> from thence we pa&s;s'd to
<HI>Sciendavil,</HI> a good Town, and at noon we got as far as
<HI>Ge|zire,</HI> which is a Town where the <HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> of the Province lives; when we had a little re&s;ted our &s;elves in a Coffee-hou&s;e, we went on our way towards the Mona&s;tery, leaving the way of <HI>Sohaitg,</HI> which we had kept till then; we turned to the right hand, towards the Mountain which is on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of the Town, we went by <HI>Itfu,</HI> an ancient Town, called by the <HI>Copties</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; about noon we got to the Mona&s;tery, where we lodg'd at night.</P>
<P>The Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Sennodius,</HI> the
<HI>Archiman|drite,</HI> &s;irnamed the <HI>White,</HI> is built near the Ru|ines of the ancient Town <HI>Adribe.</HI> There are the Remains of one of the mo&s;t Magnificent Stru|ctures that hath been in <HI>Egypt.</HI> It is four&s;quare; its Walls are builded with hewn Stones, very
<PB N="224" REF="116">white; every Stone is four foot long, and a foot and three inches high. It is &s;even and thirty Perches and two foot long, which make two hun|dred and twenty four foot, and eighteen Perches and three foot broad, which make one hundred and eleven foot. There be &s;ix great Gates of a red Stone, which now are walled up, one only ex|cepted, which now hath an open place as high as a Man. The chief Gate that is walled up is now called <HI>Bab il bagl,</HI> or <HI>the Mules Gate,</HI> in re|membrance of what happen'd to a Daughter of an Heathen King, who offered to go into the Church in contempt, riding upon a Mule, and was &s;wallowed up alive in a Pit that opened, to pu|ni&s;h her in&s;olency; which Miracle happen'd by the Prayers of S.
<HI>Sennodius,</HI> who begg'd this pu|ni&s;hment from God. This Gate is ten foot high, and &s;ix broad; every one of the Supporters is made up with four great Marble Stones, as well as the Lintil, upon which is graven three Cro&s;&s;es, one great in the middle, and two little ones on the &s;ides.</P>
<P>Round about the Building are two ranks of Win|dows, the lowe&s;t are in the middle, and the o|thers almo&s;t touch the top. The two longe&s;t &s;ides of the Building have each &s;even and twenty Windows in each Rank, and the &s;horter &s;ides each have nine in each rank, but all the&s;e Win|dows are walled up.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of this Mona&s;tery is demolli&s;hed, the
<HI>Heikel</HI> excepted, where Ma&s;s is &s;aid, and the middle. The body of the Church, called by the <HI>Copties Giamelun,</HI> was heretofore &s;upported with two ranks of Pillars, each having fourteen; which are yet &s;tanding, but in the open Air; for the Vault is fallen down.</P>
<PB N="225" REF="116">
<P>All the Pillars are not of the &s;ame Stone, nor Workman&s;hip, nor bigne&s;s, nor height; for &s;ome are rea&s;onably big, others are &s;lenderer. And to &s;uch as are &s;mall, they have clapt &s;ome Plai&s;ter, to make them as big as the others.</P>
<P>At the going in of the Chancel are to be &s;een two very beautiful Pillars of Marble, at the entry of the <HI>Heikel.</HI> Upon that which &s;tands at the left hand is graven an Epitaph in <HI>Greek,</HI> of one named <HI>Heliodorus.</HI> The&s;e Pillars are yet entire, and their Workman&s;hip is very beautiful.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every where in the Walls of the Mona|&s;tery, in the Pavement that is before the Chancel, and in the great and beautiful pair of Stairs that lead up to the Sleeping-place of the Monks, are certain great Stones full of Cyphers and Hiero|glyphick Figures placed not right; by which we may under&s;tand, that tho&s;e that have put them there had no knowledge of this my&s;terious Tongue. In the Walls within are &s;ix holes in each &s;ide, vault|ed above, and curiou&s;ly adorned with carved Leaves, &s;o hand&s;omly wrought that I could not &s;ufficiently admire the Workman&s;hip. Round about the Mona&s;tery there is much black Mar|ble.</P>
<P>In one of the Apartments of the Mona&s;tery, to|wards the
<HI>We&s;t,</HI> at the left hand as one goes in, there is a large and deep Well. The Monks told me that the Water was forty Cubits deep, and that it had been &s;anctified, or ble&s;s'd, by our Saviour. It is very &s;weet and whole&s;ome, and ri&s;es and falls with <HI>Nilus,</HI> though it hath no communication with this River.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> and the ninth day of the Month, after Ma&s;s, I went, <PB N="226" REF="117">with my
<HI>Arabian,</HI> towards <HI>Red</HI> Mona&s;tery, a|bout an hours travelling from the <HI>White,</HI> at the foot of the &s;ame Mountain, towards
<HI>Tahta.</HI></P>
<P>The colour of the Bricks with which this Mo|na&s;tery is built, hath given it the name of <HI>Red.</HI> It is built in the &s;ame manner as the
<HI>White,</HI> but a great deal le&s;s. At the <HI>South</HI>-&s;ide it hath yet a Building &s;tanding, that was cre&s;ted, as the Monks &s;ay, by S.
<HI>Helene,</HI> when &s;he went to <HI>I&s;ne</HI> to vi&s;it the bodies of the holy Martyrs. It was intended to inclo&s;e the Well of the Mona&s;tery within the Walls, and to hinder the <HI>Arabians,</HI> when they made in roads from their Mountains, from trou|bling the Monks, or taking away from them the Water.</P>
<P>There remains nothing of this Church, but the Chancel, and the
<HI>Heikel,</HI> or place where Ma&s;s is read. The Pillars that kept up the body of the Church are yet &s;tanding, all of an equal length and bigne&s;s. In this particular they excell tho&s;e of the <HI>White</HI> Mona&s;tery, as well as in the beauty of the Workman&s;hip, e&s;pecially their Capitals.</P>
<P>The Builders of this Mona&s;tery was <HI>Amba Bi&s;cioi,</HI> who having a long time liv'd as a Robber, as the Story of his Life &s;aith, at la&s;t he repented and ended his days very well. Some told me, that the Club with which he us'd to knock down Pa&s;|&s;engers is hung up in the Chancel of this Church. I &s;aw it not, becau&s;e I was told of it after I was gone out of the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>There is a Pillar al&s;o at each &s;ide of the Door of the
<HI>Heikel,</HI> of an excellent Workman&s;hip, e&s;pe|cially their Capitals, which are the mo&s;t beautiful that I ever beheld.</P>
<P>But this Mona&s;tery, as well as the <HI>White,</HI> is alto|gether ruinated within.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="117">
<P>When I had &s;een all that was worthy of notice, I return'd to
<HI>Tahta,</HI> where I arriv'd, about noon, the 21th of the month, and the next day we went to <HI>Siut.</HI></P>
<P>A few days after, I went with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Siut</HI> to the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> which is a|bout three hours travelling from thence, I fan|cied to &s;ee there &s;ome rare Reliques of Antiquity, but I was deceiv'd; for I &s;aw that it was one of the mo&s;t woful Mona&s;teries in <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;o that I &s;hall not mention it any more.</P>
<P>In our way to this Mona&s;tery, we &s;aw that of the Virgin at
<HI>Doronque,</HI> &s;cituate upon the Moun|tain that &s;tands at the right hand.</P>
<P>This Mona&s;tery, with its Church, are cut in the Rock; which is the only thing there to be noted. All the re&s;t was &s;o far from &s;atisfying my Curio&s;i|ty, that I beheld nothing but Ruines and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But that I might not lo&s;e, altogether, my labour, in climbing up to the Mountain, I went to &s;ee the Caves that were near. My Guide led me in|to one as high as a Man on hor&s;eback, &s;o extra|ordinary large, that without hyperbole a thou|&s;and Hor&s;e might there draw up in Battel array, which cau&s;ed me to wonder not a little.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were out of this large Cave, my Guide led me into another hard by, larger than the former: when I was within about two hun|dred paces, he told me to hearken to a certain place of the Wall, at the left hand as one goes in. U&s;e no doubt had made him take notice of this place; for I &s;aw no &s;ign outward to cau&s;e one to mind it. I drew near to li&s;ten, and I heard be|hind the Wall, the noi&s;e as of a Wind-mill, &s;o di|&s;tinct that I marvelled greatly, only the noi&s;e <PB N="228" REF="118">&s;eem'd to come from far. I wonder'd the more, when he told me that behind this Rock there was no empty place, nor pa&s;&s;age, for the Air to make this noi&s;e, which has continued during the me|mory of Man. All Per&s;ons of whom I inquir'd for the cau&s;e of this Wonder, told me nothing el&s;e, but that it was a <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> and that there was &s;ome hidden Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A little further, towards the <HI>South,</HI> upon the &s;ame Mountain, are to be &s;een the Ruines of an ancient Mona&s;tery, dedicated to S. <HI>Severus,</HI> Patri|arch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> whom the <HI>Copties</HI> reverence as a Saint, becau&s;e he maintain'd the Doctrine of
<HI>Dio&s;corus</HI> their Patriarch, who&s;e opinions they fol|low. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Siut</HI> told me, that heretofore three hundred and three&s;core Monks inhabited in this Mona&s;tery, who employed them&s;elves in &s;eeking for the Philo&s;opher Stone, and in the works of Chymi&s;try; an excellent Employment for &s;uch as have left the World, and for&s;aken their Riches.</P>

<HEAD>My return from <HI>Siut</HI> to <HI>Momfallot.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE 26th of <HI>March</HI> I return'd to <HI>Momfallot,</HI> with an intent to take Boat for <HI>Girge,</HI> and continue my Travels farther. I enter'd into the Town about noon; as &s;oon as I was in my former Lodging, a Man of my acquaintance gave me no|tice that the Chri&s;tians of that place, tho&s;e very Per&s;ons to whom I had been recommended by their Patriarch, had accu&s;ed me to the <HI>Ca&s;cief,</HI> and told him that I was a rich <HI>Franc,</HI> who made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to run up and down the Land, to di&s;cover <PB N="229" REF="118">where the Trea&s;ures were hid, to inform the King of <HI>France,</HI> who intended to come and Con|quer <HI>Egypt.</HI> This Friend &s;aid al&s;o that the <HI>Ca&s;|cief</HI> had commanded to take me, where ever I &s;hould be found.</P>
<P>This wicked news made me think upon a re|treat, and at that time there was no conveniency to go by Water to <HI>Girge,</HI> and becau&s;e the
<HI>Ca&s;cief</HI> might have &s;ooner taken me on that &s;ide, his Ju|ri&s;diction reaching a great way; I went back to <HI>Melave,</HI> becau&s;e his Dominion was but narrow thitherward. I took that way to return to
<HI>Cairo,</HI> the place of my ordinary abode, whither I went by Land; for I had been by Water before.</P>
<P>At our going out of <HI>Momfallot</HI> we went by <HI>Om il Co&s;&s;ur,</HI> a Village, where great Mountains of Ruines are to he &s;een. We left next at our left hand, the &s;igns of the ancient Town
<HI>Co&s;&s;ie,</HI> which is called by the <HI>Greek</HI> Authors
<HI>Apollonopolis.</HI> We went by <HI>Sennabo</HI> next, which is a very good and populous Town. We &s;aw <HI>Biblau, Bamib,</HI> and af|ter Sun &s;et we came to <HI>Tarut I&s;&s;cerif,</HI> a great Vil|lage, where we were entertained <HI>gratis</HI> by an <HI>A|rabian</HI> Lord, who keeps an Hou&s;e of Ho&s;pitality, called in that Tongue <HI>Beit diafe,</HI> to lodge Stran|gers, that will &s;tay there a night, with their Bea&s;ts. He entertains them at his own charge.</P>
<P>The next day, the 28th of the Month, after that I had returned thanks to my Benefactor, I went &s;treight to <HI>Melave.</HI> At our going out of <HI>Tarut I&s;|&s;cerif,</HI> I went through the Channel of
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Ri|ver on foot, for there it begins. I went next to
<HI>Tanuf,</HI> a Village, where &s;ome Ruines are yet to be &s;een; and about noon we were at <HI>Melave,</HI> where I lodged at the <HI>Occale,</HI> or Inn, that is near the <PB N="230" REF="119">Market-place, at the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of the Town, near the great <HI>Mo&s;que;</HI> and becau&s;e the upper Cham|bers were all taken up by <HI>Turks,</HI> I was obliged to lodge in a very low Room, where I met with ma|ny inconveniences, becau&s;e it was near the Door, at the pa&s;&s;age of all comers and goers.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 29th of the Month, the <HI>Turks</HI> begin the Fea&s;t called <HI>Eid il dehie,</HI> or <HI>the Ea&s;ter of the Victims;</HI> for they u&s;e to kill Sheep during this Fe&s;tival, and give the Fle&s;h to the Poor for Gods &s;ake. This Fe&s;tival continues three days, during which time the <HI>Copties</HI> buy no Victuals from the
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> nor Bread, Wine, Fle&s;h, Coffee, nor Water. By this they di&s;cover their abhorrency of that Religion; for thereby they &s;hun all oc|ca&s;ions of communicating with them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Melave</HI> I got acquaintance with an Arch-Prie&s;t of that place, called <HI>Na&s;&s;r alla.</HI> He was the hone&s;te&s;t, civile&s;t, and able&s;t Man that I ever knew of that Nation. There are about &s;even hundred <HI>Caraches,</HI> or Heads, that pay Tribute. They have there a Church, dedicaced to S. <HI>Mi|chael,</HI> which is but little, poor, and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Nilus</HI> &s;wallowed up heretofore the ancient
<HI>Melave,</HI> and now the River runs in the place where that Town &s;tood. The Town now is built in another place, where was anciently a Wood that was a retreat for Robbers.</P>

<HEAD>A Voyage into the Lower <HI>Thebes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was loth to return to <HI>Cairo</HI> without &s;eeing the Country of the Lower <HI>Thebes,</HI> or at lea&s;t a part of it, &s;eeing that I was &s;o near it; I re&s;olv|ed therefore to follow the advice of my Friend,
<PB N="231" REF="119">the Arch-Prie&s;t, and to go to the Mona&s;tery of
<HI>Abuhennis il Ke&s;&s;ir,</HI> or of S. <HI>John</HI> the little, where|of he was Governour, &s;cituate near the ancient Town <HI>In&s;ine,</HI> on the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> about an hours travelling from
<HI>Melave,</HI> to &s;ee the Rarities thereabouts.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> I went from
<HI>Me|lave</HI> to this Mona&s;tery; and the next day, being our
<HI>Ea&s;ter-Sunday,</HI> I got a Guide to lead me upon the Mountain, which is behind, on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide, to &s;ee the Caves of the ancient Hermites that are round about, and near to the Town, which have given to it the name of <HI>Thebes,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee in the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I went into many of the&s;e Caves that were all very large. I &s;aw nothing worthy of notice, but in &s;ome certain Cro&s;&s;es graven in the Rock; and upon the Walls of one I &s;aw two Angels, holding up with their hands a Cro&s;s in the Air.</P>
<P>The only thing that pleas'd me among the&s;e Caves, was a Mona&s;tery, with a Church, all cut in a firm Rock. The Vault of the Church was &s;mooth, and the Paving very even. The Walls were painted in an antick fa&s;hion, with the Hi|&s;tories of the New Te&s;tament, with Images of Hermites, and Saints, who&s;e names were writ|ten underneath in
<HI>Coptick</HI> Letters. At the end of the Church, <HI>Southward,</HI> I &s;aw a Cro&s;s cut in the Rock, with a <HI>Greek</HI> In&s;cription, in ancient Cha|racters. And upon the Walls of another Cave, at a little di&s;tance from this Church, and higher, a|bout the top of the Mountain, I &s;ound al&s;o ano|ther graven upon the Wall; and near this, two others, which are all Epitaphs of Abbots there Interr'd. I could not cau&s;e them to be put here,
<PB N="232" REF="120">becau&s;e the Printer would not be at the charge of the Characters.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the third, being <HI>Monday</HI> in
<HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Week, I went to the ancient Town of <HI>In&s;ine,</HI> called in the <HI>Copties</HI> Dictionaries <HI>Antinoe,</HI> and <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P>I went to &s;ee fir&s;t the Tomb of <HI>Mahomet Bey,</HI> a
<HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Girge,</HI> about fourteen years ago. When he took arms again&s;t <HI>Pacha Gaze,</HI> he was defeat|ed at <HI>Melave,</HI> and his men for&s;ook him; he was taken and &s;trangled. His Tomb is out of the City in the common burying place, and though there is nothing there extraordinary, I was de&s;irous to &s;ee it, becau&s;e he hath been, and is yet in great reputation among&s;t the Inhabitants for his Ju|&s;tice and good Government, which hath cau&s;ed him to be lamented by all the <HI>&V;pper Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>When I had &s;een this Tomb, I walked into the Town, and the fir&s;t thing that I took notice of, as a great Antiquity, was the Pillar of
<HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> Its bottom is above five foot, the four uppermo&s;t are all even, and the fifth below is a|dorned with carved leaves. In the Ba&s;is is a <HI>Greek</HI> In&s;cription containing thirteen lines.</P>
<P>I &s;aw near this Pillar the pieces of three o|thers, very much re&s;embling this, but broken down; there was nothing of them &s;tanding but the Ba&s;is of one.</P>
<P>From the Pillar I went to &s;ee the <HI>Arch of Tri|umph,</HI> which is almo&s;t all &s;tanding. I took a de|light to climb up to it by a little pair of Stairs winding up in the Wall of the Arch, containing fifty &s;teps, or thereabouts. I re&s;ted my &s;elf at the greate&s;t Window which is upon the chief Vault, where I had the &s;atisfaction to di&s;cover all its ruines, and the &s;cituation of this Town, heretofore &s;o famous.</P>
<PB N="233" REF="120">
<P>This Arch is alone, and altogether &s;eparated from the other Ruines, and about four paces from the River <HI>Nilus;</HI> but for want of an In&s;cription, none knows for whom, and by whom it hath been rais'd. It is not inrich'd with carved Works, as tho&s;e of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Rome;</HI> neverthele&s;s it is one of the mo&s;t beautiful that I have ever &s;een.</P>
<P>One of its fronts hath eight and forty foot in breadth, and one of its &s;ides four and twenty. The great Vault in the middle, which is between two little ones, is about 16 foot broad, and each of the two little ones &s;even foot. The thickne&s;s of the Wall which is between the great and the little Vaults, which is but one &s;tone, is of &s;ix foot and two inches: The thickne&s;s which is between the little Vault, and the outward Angle of the Arch, is of five foot: The front that looks to|wards <HI>Nilus,</HI> is on the
<HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>There is yet fourteen Pillars of Marble on the left hand of this Arch, in a &s;treight line towards the River; &s;ome of them have their Capitals, others have lo&s;t them; &s;ome are joyned to the Huts of &s;ome
<HI>Arabians</HI> that dwell there. On the &s;ame &s;ide, towards the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Abuhennis,</HI> are to be &s;een three beautiful Pillars of
<HI>Porphyry</HI> &s;tanding; &s;ome of them have their tops; a fourth lies along the ground near by.</P>
<P>In the Mo&s;que of this Town is a <HI>Sciech,</HI> or
<HI>Saint,</HI> whom the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Sciech Abade,</HI> for whom they have a great Veneration, for they be|lieve him to have been a
<HI>Mahometan;</HI> but they are much deceived, he was a Chri&s;tian, a Bi&s;hop of <HI>I&s;ne,</HI> he &s;uffered Martyrdom at <HI>I&s;ne.</HI> They have called him <HI>Sciech Abade,</HI> by an error which the Sir-name of this Bi&s;hop hath cau&s;ed. He was cal|led <PB N="234" REF="121"><HI>Ammonius il Abed,</HI> or <HI>the devout Ammonius.</HI> The <HI>Arabians,</HI> through a mi&s;take of the word <HI>Abed,</HI> making it a proper name, whereas it is but an appellative, have called him <HI>Sciech Abade.</HI> His Reliques are kept in the <HI>Heikel</HI> of this Church, which now is a Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>I went afterwards to take a view of a magni|ficent Palace, called by the <HI>Arabians Abulkerun,</HI> or the <HI>horned Building,</HI> becau&s;e, as I think, the Pil|lars that are before this Palace have Capitals, whereof the Angles are &s;o great, that they ap|pear as &s;o many Horns to the beholders, which the word <HI>Kern</HI> &s;ignifies. But when I had viewed &s;o many old Reliques, I was &s;o weary, that I re|turned to the Mona&s;tery; and the rather, becau&s;e of the violent heat, with an intent to return ano|ther day, and examine all things more exactly.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fourth of <HI>April,</HI> I went with my ordinary Guide to &s;ee the <HI>Vadigamus,</HI> and the Caves that are there.
<HI>Vadigamus</HI> is a narrow Val|ley, between two Mountains, which are as high as one another, and flat on the top. This Valley is like a Bugle, from whence I believe this Valley hath borrowed the name; for the word
<HI>Vadiga|mus</HI> &s;ignifies the Valley of the Bugle. At the be|ginning it hath a large entrance, which an&s;wers to a great &s;andy Plain, which is at one &s;ide of the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Abuhennis.</HI> It &s;tretches it &s;elf
<HI>Southwards,</HI> about half an hours travelling over: Afterwards it ri&s;eth by degrees to the top of the Mountains, where it unites and joyns them, and repre&s;ents the bottom of a Sack.</P>
<P>On both &s;ides of the&s;e two Mountains that face one another, are two Ranks of Caves, each Rank containing fifty Caves, or thereabouts,
<PB N="235" REF="121">which make one hundred Caves upon each Moun|tain. I enter'd into &s;ome of them that were &s;o high, that three long Pikes tyed to one another would not have reach'd to the top: They are ve|ry large, but without order within, and uneven, and not perfectly &s;quare.</P>
<P>I have wondered at the capricious de&s;igns of the Ancient
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> to make &s;uch wide Caves &s;o high, and &s;o numerous, yielding &s;o little con|veniency to the Inhabitants, for they are made upon the &s;teep Mountains of Sand, far from Towns and Water, digg'd in the dark and main Rocks. If I had not perus'd the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Said ibn Patrik,</HI> who &s;aith, that the <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s, Kings of <HI>Egypt,</HI> imployed the
<HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in digging in the&s;e Mountains, I &s;hould be of the opinion of the Country people, who believe that all the&s;e Caves have been made by Devils, who have been thereunto forced by Conjurers, this Art having been always much practis'd in <HI>Egypt;</HI> for one would think that it is not po&s;&s;ible for men to make them: and I dare &s;ay, that when a Traveller hath &s;een all the Curio&s;ities of <HI>Egypt,</HI> if he hath not &s;een the&s;e Mountains and Caves of the Pro|vince of <HI>Thebes,</HI> he hath &s;een nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the fifth of the Month, I went again to
<HI>In&s;ine,</HI> to look upon its Ruines with more ex|actne&s;s, and chiefly upon the Pillars that &s;tand before the <HI>Abulkerun,</HI> on the
<HI>North-we&s;t</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>There are in all four before the front of this Palace, which heretofore was very magnificent, but now there remains but little, incompa&s;&s;ed a|bout with the Ruines. Two of the&s;e Pillars are on the one &s;ide of the door, and two on the o|ther; three are yet &s;tanding, only a third part of <PB N="236" REF="122">the fourth appears: they are made of a certain white &s;andy &s;tone, which is taken out of the Mountains near this Town: they are hollow on the &s;ides, from the bottom to the middle, but the re&s;t upwards is &s;mooth: the bottom or bulk is nigh thirteen foot about; their Capitals are of two pieces, &s;even foot in Diameter; every bot|tom is of five pieces, and every piece is &s;even foot long.</P>
<P>There was behind this Palace, on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide, four other Pillars of the &s;ame bigne&s;s, form, and &s;ub&s;tance; but they are overthrown. I could &s;carce di&s;cern where their Ba&s;is &s;tood: the Pillar of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> &s;tands at the
<HI>North-We&s;t</HI> &s;ide of this old Palace.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day I went again to &s;ee the Pillar of <HI>Marcus Aurelius;</HI> its Ba&s;is is thirteen foot high, made up with eight ranks of &s;tones; the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t is half in the ground, and half out; the &s;econd is two foot high; the third a foot and eight inches; the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth, upon which is the In&s;cription, each two foot and two inches; the &s;eventh bends out; the eighth is the immediate Ba&s;is upon which the Pillar &s;tands: This Ba&s;is is five foot long, and two foot and ten inches high; it is &s;quare in the bottom, in the middle Octogone, or of eight Angles, and in the top Oval: upon this &s;tone is the bottom of the Pillar, which is made up of five pieces; the lowermo&s;t is beautified with Oaken leaves car|ved in the &s;tone; I have never &s;een the like el&s;e|where, it is three foot and a half high; the four other pieces are of &s;even foot each, and three inches long; the Diameter of the Pillar is of three foot and &s;even inches; the Capital is of <PB N="237" REF="122">one &s;tone, three foot and an inch high; the Cir|cumference is of &s;even foot; upon the Capital &s;tands an unpoli&s;h'd &s;tone, four foot and two inches long, and three foot high.</P>
<P>I perceived that in this Town heretofore there hath been two Streets more remarkable than the others; one begun at the <HI>Abulkerun,</HI> and ended at the four Pillars of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> &s;tretching from
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>North.</HI> This Street was adorned with two ranks of Pillars, one rank in each &s;ide: the &s;econd begins at the Arch of Triumph, which is at one end of the Town, at the <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> drawing to the
<HI>North-Ea&s;t.</HI> The&s;e Streets are very long, large, &s;treight, and full of ruines of &s;tately Palaces.</P>
<P>About three a Clock in the Afternoon, I went the third time to &s;ee the Mona&s;tery digg'd in the Rock, mentioned before. I have always taken a great delight to view it, becau&s;e the &s;ight of it moved my Devotion: It &s;tands about half an hours travelling a-foot from the Mona&s;tery of
<HI>Abuhennis,</HI> where I was, and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> from this Mo|na&s;tery.</P>
<P>In <HI>In&s;ine,</HI> as well as in the Caves of the Moun|tains round about, are to be &s;een in the ground great Pots, in which the ancient Inhabitants of this Province kept their Wines: They have an Ear at each &s;ide, and are &s;harp at the bottom, that they might be &s;ixed in the ground: my Guide found many, which he brought to me; but the Wine was dried within, and as black as Pitch: I have &s;ent two of them to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eventh of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Good-Friday</HI> of the
<HI>Copties,</HI> I went with my Guide to &s;ee the Caves that are near the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Amba Bi&s;cioi,</HI> a|bout <PB N="238" REF="123">a mile from the Convent, towards the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarkable thing that I &s;aw, was the Hieroglyphick Cave, which the Country people commonly call the Church. I conceive this mi|&s;take proceeds from the Cro&s;&s;es which are paint|ed every where within.</P>
<P>To go into this Cave, one mu&s;t pa&s;s through another before it. This was heretofore very beautiful and great, but now it is much decayed. The top is fallen down; there remains nothing but the two &s;ide-walls, full of Hieroglyphick Fi|gures graven in the Rock; &s;ome are great, others are little, others are of a moderate &s;ize, but all very clean in good order.</P>
<P>From thence is a pa&s;&s;age into the Hierogly|phick Cave, which I believe was a Temple of the Heathens: It is &s;quare, very &s;mooth within, cut in the Rock, &s;our Perches long, three Perches and one foot broad, and two Perches high: The door that leads into it is four foot and a half large. In this Cave, over again&s;t the door, is a hole in the Wall, of a Perch and a foot deep, and four foot broad, and a Perch and one foot and eight inches high. This Cave is full of Images in the Walls, and above, which repre&s;ent their Sciences by Emblemes, and Hieroglyphick Fi|gures, with very little Characters in their Lan|guage round about. The colours of them are &s;o beautiful and lively, that I could not but wonder how they could continue &s;o fre&s;h, during &s;o ma|ny Ages.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this great number of Characters there painted, are to be &s;een &s;ome lines of the &s;ame little Characters very clean carved in the Wall, <PB N="239" REF="123">&s;ome reaching from one end to the other, others from the top to the bottom. The&s;e Characters, and Figures, are &s;o numerous, that they are not to be drawn by any in le&s;s than a Months time.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e two Caves there is a rank of o|thers in the Rock, very even within, but they are without Figures, and le&s;s, and not &s;o high as the former; for they are but &s;ix foot high. In the bottom of every Cave is a Well, &s;quare, and deep in the Rock, into which one may go down by the means of holes, or &s;teps, made on purpo&s;e in both &s;ides of every Well. And in the bottom of every Well is an Alley in the Rock, but becau&s;e the&s;e Alleys are durty and ob&s;cure, none of our Company would venture to go down. In the Walls of &s;ome of the&s;e Caves are &s;quare holes, &s;ix foot deep, and two foot broad, about the bigne&s;s of a Coffin; which makes me believe that the
<HI>Egyp|tians</HI> did put here their dead in the&s;e Caves.</P>
<P>A little farther, towards the <HI>South,</HI> is another large Cave. I &s;aw on the left hand an Hierogly|phick Picture in the Wall, with thirteen lines un|derneath, of Characters cut in the Picture.</P>
<P>From this Cave, which is at the end of the Moun|tain, towards the <HI>South,</HI> we went back to the Mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Abuhennis;</HI> and in our way we &s;aw all the Caves that are in order upon this Mountain, as far as the place where the <HI>Vadigamus</HI> begins. We &s;aw no rarity, only &s;ome painted Cro&s;&s;es, in red, roughly drawn; from whence we gathered, that heretofore they have &s;erved as Churches.</P>
<P>By the differing Workman&s;hip of the&s;e Caves, one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch as have been made by the ancient
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> by the Chri&s;tians, and Anchorites that cau&s;ed this Province to flouri&s;h; <PB N="240" REF="124">for the former are very regular, out within, with much care, and &s;mooth; but the others are rough, and irregular.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the Country People think that there is no Cave without a rich Trea&s;ure, the <HI>A|rabians</HI> have digg'd every where, and &s;poil'd al&s;o the Hieroglyphick Cave, which is named the Church. They have &s;o much undermin'd the Walls that &s;ome of the top is fallen down, and the Rain hath &s;poiled &s;ome of the Emblems, and Characters that adorned the Wall. And, as if Time had not blotted out enough, they have put out the Eyes of the Images, and Figures, in a bru|ti&s;h manner, natural to them. I was highly di&s;|pleas'd to &s;ee this; for were it not for this bru|tality, this beautiful Cave would have kept it &s;elf&punc; entire till now.</P>
<P>When we had &s;taid nine days in the Mona&s;tery of
<HI>Abuhennis,</HI> I return'd to <HI>Melave,</HI> the 8th of <HI>A|pril;</HI> from whence I went, the 15th of the &s;ame Month, to <HI>Minie,</HI> altering my fir&s;t de&s;ign to go by Land; for I &s;aw that it would be too painful, and too dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Minie,</HI> in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Books called <HI>Miniet ibn cha&s;&s;it,</HI> is an ancient, great, and beautiful Town, on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus.</HI> Its Antiquity appears by its old Buildings, by its &s;trait Streets, &s;o nar|row that two Men can &s;carce to a-brea&s;t. In this Town the <HI>Bardaques,</HI> or Water-pots, are made, which are highly e&s;teem'd at <HI>Cairo,</HI> for their fa|&s;hion, and property, to cool Water. They are made with a kind of Clay, taken about a days Journey from thence, on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> in a place called
<HI>Sciech fadl,</HI> from the name of a religious <HI>Mahometan</HI> there Interr'd.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="124">
<P>The 19th of this Month, I went aboard a Ve&s;|&s;el, bound for
<HI>Bene&s;uef;</HI> a good Wind carried us a great way in a little &s;pace of time. At nine a Clock we were over again&s;t <HI>Gebel Teir,</HI> or <HI>the Mountain of Birds;</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e at a &s;et day of the year, all the Birds round about meet in a place, where a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> draws them together from all &s;ides, and cau&s;eth them to &s;tay there one day; when they have continued there till night, they all fly away, one excepted, which remains there, the Bill fixed in the Rock, till the &s;ame day the next year; at which time it falls down, and another takes its place.</P>
<P>When we pa&s;s'd over again&s;t this Mountain, I &s;aw on the top a Stone, which is called the Camel, becau&s;e, at a di&s;tance, it is like a Camel. A lit|tle further in our way, we di&s;cover'd <HI>Taka,</HI> or the Window, or a great hole which Nature hath made in the Rock, like a Window; which &s;erves as a pa&s;&s;age for the Birds when they go to their Ren|dezvous whither the <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> draws them, as the People of the Country &s;ay, and their Hi&s;torians affirm.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Moors</HI> are come to this Window, they u&s;e to &s;ay the Chapter of the <HI>Fatha,</HI> or fir&s;t Chapter of the
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> for the poor People, who live, as they &s;ay, in this part of the Mountain, as Bea&s;ts, feeding upon nothing but raw Herbs. Af|ter Dinner we went by <HI>Bene Mohammed il Kifur,</HI> a Village &s;cituate on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus.</HI> O|ver again&s;t it is an old Mona&s;tery, ruinated; and a little further appear a great many Caves, upon the Mountain near by. After we had pa&s;s'd by an old Ca&s;tle de&s;troyed, we went to lye at <HI>Be|nemzar,</HI> a great Village, &s;cituate on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide <PB N="242" REF="125">of <HI>Nilus,</HI> this River having wa&s;h'd away almo&s;t half the Buildings.</P>
<P>We went from thence, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> morning, the 20th of
<HI>April,</HI> with a <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> Wind, fit to carry us to
<HI>Bene&s;uef.</HI> It was yet in the morning when we &s;ailed before
<HI>Heggiar Selame,</HI> which is a Bank in the River <HI>Nilus.</HI> Over again&s;t it are the Ruines of an ancient Town, and the Tomb of a
<HI>Sciech,</HI> or Saint. About noon we were near the Ruines of another ancient Town, called <HI>Medinet Giahel,</HI> which &s;tands at the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nilus;</HI> there are to be &s;een yet &s;everal Remains of Hou&s;es, made up with Bricks dried in the Sun. Over a|gain&s;t it is
<HI>Feggen,</HI> a Village often mention'd in a Book called <HI>Sinaxar.</HI> After Dinner a &s;trong Wind aro&s;e, and forced us to &s;top at <HI>Bebe,</HI> a great Village which is near <HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> where we found incamped a Troop of <HI>Arabians,</HI> called <HI>Ateijat,</HI> with whom I pa&s;s'd the re&s;t of the day in di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> the 21th of the Month, we arriv'd at
<HI>Bene&s;uef,</HI> where we continued till the next day; and on the 24th of the Month I returned to <HI>Caire,</HI> without &s;eeing <HI>I&s;ne,</HI> as I had an intent.</P>
<P>But that the Reader may know what rarities are to be &s;een in this Town, and round about, I have here added that which hath been taken no|tice of by Father <HI>Portais,</HI> a <HI>Capuchin,</HI> in the year 1668. according to the account given me by the Reverend Father <HI>Francis,</HI> his Brother, and Compa|nion in his Travels. M. <HI>Thevenot</HI> hath already in&s;erted it in his Collection of Travels, printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> in Folio; but not &s;o large, nor with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Particulars here added.</P>
<P>Of all the Towns of the Upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="243" REF="125">the
<HI>Copties</HI> have Churches, that of <HI>I&s;ne</HI> is the fur|the&s;t from
<HI>Cairo.</HI> It is built at the <HI>We&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> upon a Hill that &s;tretches along the River. It may be judged to be an ancient Town, by a Temple of Pagans yet &s;tanding. The <HI>Copties</HI> have there two Churches, but very poor; one is dedicated to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and the other to S. <HI>Pelagius.</HI> The Chri&s;tian <HI>Copties</HI> here may make twenty <HI>Caraches</HI> in number; they are all Wea|vers, and ruled by two Arch-Prie&s;ts, the one na|med <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the other
<HI>Soliman.</HI></P>
<P>Half a mile from <HI>I&s;ne</HI> is to be &s;een a Convent, which the <HI>Copties</HI> &s;ay hath been built by S. <HI>Helena,</HI> dedicated to the holy Martyrs of this Town, whom the Governour of
<HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> Ma&s;&s;acred in &s;uch numbers, that their dead Corp&s;es cover|ed four&s;core <HI>Fiddans,</HI> or Acres of Ground. Round about this Burying-place are to be &s;een Tombs curiou&s;ly wrought, which they &s;ay were erected by this holy Empre&s;s.</P>
<P>Three leagues from <HI>I&s;ne</HI> is another Convent, dedicated to S. <HI>Matthew,</HI> where are four or five Tombs, like tho&s;e that we come from mention|ing. Upon an Altar Stone of a little Chappel, dedicated to St.
<HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angel, we &s;ound &s;ome Characters which were not Hyero|glyphick, in a Language that we under&s;tood not.</P>
<P>About eleven leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>I&s;ne,</HI> at the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nilus,</HI> is to be &s;een <HI>Tuot,</HI> a great Town, where is a Temple of the ancient <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>Twelve leagues from <HI>Tuot,</HI> at the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of
<HI>Ni|lus,</HI> is <HI>Arment,</HI> heretofore a great Town, but now for&s;aken and ruinated. They call it in <HI>Arabick Beled Mu&s;e,</HI> or
<HI>the Country of Mo&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believe that
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was born here. <PB N="244" REF="126">Here is under ground an ancient Temple.</P>
<P>Two leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Tuot,</HI> are two Vil|lages very famous; namely, <HI>Luxor,</HI> and <HI>Luxor il Kadim,</HI> or <HI>the old Luxor;</HI> they are about half a league from one another.</P>
<P>At <HI>Luxor</HI> is to be &s;een the Remains of an an|cient, and beautiful Temple of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> in which are three&s;core and eighteen Pillars of a prodigious bigne&s;s, chiefly fourteen, placed in rank, two and two; &s;o big that &s;ix Men can &s;carce embrace them, but they are but &s;ix Perches high.</P>
<P>The bottom of this Temple is yet entire; here are &s;everal Chambers, and &s;eparations, whereof the Walls are full, from the top to the bottom, of Figures roughly drawn, and Hieroglyphick Let|ters carved over. Before the Door &s;tands two Needles, &s;quare, and very high and entire; &s;o fre&s;h that one would think that the Workman hath newly fini&s;h'd them. They are on every &s;ide eight foot broad.</P>
<P>Near their Ba&s;is are two Statues of Women, of black Marble; and though they be half under ground, to the Girdle, they &s;tand out as high as three Men.</P>
<P>Their bigne&s;s is an&s;werable to their height; for there is twelve foot from one &s;houlder to ano|ther. They have a &s;trange kind of covering up|on their heads, with a Globe on the top. Their Faces are disfigur'd, the re&s;t is whole.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of the Fronti&s;piece of this Temple, is with the other Pictures.</P>
<P>At the old <HI>Luxor</HI> is a very ancient Palace. Its Ruines &s;hew that it hath been very glorious. They &s;ay, that here dwelt one of the ancient Kings of <HI>Egypt.</HI> In the Walks of this Palace are to be &s;een
<PB N="245" REF="126">many <HI>Sphinxes,</HI> in ranks, on both &s;ides of the Al|leys, two foot from one another, looking upon the Alley. They have every one, one and twen|ty foot in length. This Palace hath four Walks, that an&s;wer to four Gates. In the fir&s;t are one hundred and twenty <HI>Sphinxes,</HI> three&s;core in each &s;ide; and in the &s;econd are one hundred and two, one and fifty in a&s;ide. Every Walk is about the length of a place to play at
<HI>Mall.</HI> the Gates of the Palace are extraordinary high, made with the mo&s;t beautiful Stones in the World; one of the &s;ides of the Gate is &s;ix and twenty foot high. (I find in another Copy of this Relation, that it hath thirty &s;ix foot.) The Palace is &s;o defaced, that there is no order, nor beauty, that appears; neverthele&s;s there are &s;o many curious things in it, that no Man in a Month, can take a full view of them; for there is above a Million of Figures, roughly drawn; &s;ome are covered over, others appear with an open face. Here are al&s;o a great many Pillars; I counted, &s;aith the Father, in a Par|lour three&s;core, which are all &s;o great, that five Men can &s;carce embrace one of them about.</P>
<P>In the Court of the Palace is a Ba&s;on garni&s;hed about with beautiful Stones, and full of a bitter VVater, which, as the People &s;ay, whitens Li|nen very well. I tried it, &s;aith the Father, by dipping into it my Handkerchief, which kept above four days the &s;mell of Soap. At one Front of the Palace are two Statues of a Giant, of one Stone, as white as Alaba&s;ter. They have Swords by their &s;ides. In the middle of the Palace is a|nother, as high as three Men, not well polli&s;h'd, but well proportioned.</P>
<P>A league on this &s;ide there is an ancient Town,
<PB N="246" REF="127">called <HI>Habu,</HI> where are to be &s;een many rari|ties, chiefly <HI>Mommies.</HI> At a di&s;tance one may there di&s;cover two Statues; one of a Man, the other of a VVoman. The Country People call that
<HI>Sciama,</HI> and this <HI>Tama,</HI> They &s;eem to be at lea&s;t as big as the <HI>Abulhon,</HI> or the <HI>Sphinx</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Cairo.</HI> Near this place is a Village, where is to be &s;een two Statues from the River
<HI>Nilus,</HI> &s;o new that one would think the Workman had ju&s;t perfected them.</P>
<P>Thirteen leagues on this &s;ide of the old <HI>Luxor,</HI> is a Town named <HI>Neggade,</HI> where is a Bi&s;hop with about &s;eventy Families of Chri&s;tian <HI>Copties.</HI> Here is yet three Mona&s;teries, one is called
<HI>Deir il Salib,</HI> or <HI>the Mona&s;tery of the holy Cro&s;s;</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Deir il Megma;</HI> the third <HI>Deir Mary Poctor;</HI> but the&s;e two la&s;t are not inhabited.</P>
<P>Two miles from <HI>Neggade,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of <HI>Nilus,</HI> is the ancient Town of <HI>Kus;</HI> but here are but three&s;core Chri&s;tian <HI>Copties,</HI> who have here a Church, dedicated to S. <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>
<P>Six leagues from <HI>Neggade,</HI> on this &s;ide, is
<HI>Ken|ne,</HI> a Village &s;cituate on the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Bank of
<HI>Ni|lus.</HI> It is a Mart-Town, and the Rendezvous of the <HI>Caravans</HI> that go from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Co&s;&s;eir,</HI> hereto|fore named
<HI>Berenice,</HI> four days Journies from this Village, and a Haven of the
<HI>Red-Sea.</HI> The Chri&s;tians that live at <HI>Kenne</HI> are very poor, and without any Church.</P>
<P>Two leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Kenne</HI> is the an|cient Town of <HI>Tentiris,</HI> now called <HI>Dendera,</HI> where is a wonderful Temple of the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> of a prodigious bigne&s;s and height. It is to be &s;een at two leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Macrizi</HI> &s;aith, that it hath as many Windows
<PB N="247" REF="127">as there are days in the year: They are &s;o plac'd, that every one an&s;wers to a degree of the <HI>Zodi|ack;</HI> &s;o that the Sun ri&s;ing in a differing degree every day of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> it &s;ends in its Beams into a di&s;tinct Window from the day before: And when at the end of the year it hath fini&s;h'd and run through every degree of the
<HI>Zodiack,</HI> it hath al&s;o from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> ca&s;t in its Beams into e|very Window of this Temple: For this cau&s;e it is look'd upon as a Wonder in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Ten Leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Dendera,</HI> at the
<HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nilus,</HI> is <HI>Ca&s;&s;r,</HI> a Village where is an old Convent, dedicated to <HI>Amba Balamon:</HI> Over a|gain&s;t this Village is the ancient Town <HI>Hu,</HI> where is yet a Convent dedicated to S.
<HI>Menna,</HI> but there was then no Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>Two Leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Hu,</HI> on the &s;ame Bank is
<HI>Bahgiura,</HI> at a little di&s;tance from the River: Its Port is called
<HI>Sahel;</HI> there is two Convents, one dedicated to S. <HI>Bidabe,</HI> the other to S. <HI>George.</HI> At two Leagues on this &s;ide of
<HI>Bahgiura,</HI> on the &s;ame Bank, is the Village <HI>Be|liene,</HI> where is a very beautiful Church under ground, dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin.
<HI>Girge,</HI> the chief Town of the <HI>&V;pper Egypt,</HI> &s;tands &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Beliene</HI> on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>Here ends the Relation of Father <HI>Portais.</HI> I could wi&s;h that this good man had given us a more exact account, and more at large of the Rarities that he &s;aw in the&s;e places, for this Re|lation is &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>The 14th of <HI>June,</HI> I went at <HI>Cairo</HI> to &s;ee the
<HI>Inchanted watering place,</HI> called in <HI>Arabick, Houd il mera&s;&s;et,</HI> which is under the Mo&s;que of the Pa|lace,
<PB N="248" REF="128">called <HI>Kalet it Keb&s;ch,</HI> no Taveller hath o|ver &s;poken of it.</P>
<P>It is a black Marble-&s;tone, made like a Water|ing place, &s;even foot long, ari&s;ing out of the ground about a foot and a half: The &s;ides, with|in and without, are adorned with little Hiero|glyphick Letters, as well as the Brims. The peo|ple of <HI>Cairo</HI> &s;ay, that in the time of the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the &s;ick people did recover their health by drinking Water out of it; and that by the virtue of a <HI>Ra&s;&s;em,</HI> or Charm, which the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Egypt</HI> had given to it.</P>
<P>The 20th of this Month I went to &s;ee the won|derful Well which is in the Ca&s;tle, commonly na|med <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s <HI>Well.</HI> Its top is &s;quare, very large, cut in the Rock; it is about one hundred and twenty Perches deep, the Perch containing &s;ix foot. The water is drawn out with two Wheels, the one plac'd at the Mouth of the Well, and the other about three&s;core and fifteen Perches under|neath. There are two Oxen at each Wheel to turn them; the lowe&s;t, which is fifty Perches a|bove the water, &s;erves to draw the water into a Ba&s;on there on purpo&s;e; and from thence, the upper Wheel draws the water to the top. The Bea&s;ts that work there, go up and down very commodiou&s;ly by a great large Path, which re|ceives the light through Windows cut on that &s;ide which looks to the water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian</HI> Authors call it <HI>Bir haleizun,</HI> or the <HI>Snails Well,</HI> becau&s;e there is a Path-way that winds round about. The people commonly &s;ay, that it was digg'd by Spirits; I am almo&s;t incline|able to believe it, for I cannot conceive how men can compa&s;s &s;o wonderful a work.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="128">
<P>The Waters, as the Guardian told me, come out of the firm Rock, and yet increa&s;e and de|crea&s;e as the River <HI>Nilus:</HI> But I have heard o|thers &s;ay, that they come out of the great <HI>Aque|duct</HI> which is in old <HI>Cairo.</HI> Becau&s;e I could not un|der&s;tand the truth of it, I wi&s;h that &s;ome other Traveller would inform him&s;elf better.</P>
<P>They that think that <HI>Jo&s;eph, Jacob</HI>'s Son, cau|&s;ed it to be digged, are deceived, for the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cairo</HI> was built many Ages after <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s death; and it is the common opinion of all the <HI>Arabian</HI> Authors, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> dwelt at <HI>Memphis,</HI> which was on the other &s;ide of the River, near the <HI>Py|namids,</HI> and not on this &s;ide where <HI>Cairo</HI> &s;tands.</P>
<P>The 9th of this Month they cryed about Town <HI>Ouf alla,</HI> that the River was ri&s;en &s;ixteen Cubits high. The next day, being S.
<HI>Laurences</HI> day, they cut through the <HI>Calitz</HI> with Ceremony; but there was no great rejoycings, becau&s;e the <HI>Pacha</HI> had ob&s;erv'd that before, and every <HI>Pacha</HI> performs it but once in his time.</P>
<P>On the 18th of the &s;ame Month there hap|pen'd a mi&s;chance to a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, which di&s;covers the wonderful jealou&s;ie of the
<HI>Turks.</HI> As this Merchant was taking the air at a Win|dow of his hou&s;e in the Even, on the <HI>Calitz</HI> &s;ide, a <HI>Jani&s;&s;ary</HI> that lived over again&s;t him, thinking that he made &s;igns to his Women and Slaves, &s;hot off a Pi&s;tol at him, and wounded him in the hand. The <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul could never obtain from the Ju&s;tice of <HI>Cairo</HI> to cau&s;e this Villain to be puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Bonne|cor&s;e,</HI> before Con&s;ul of <HI>Seyda,</HI> &s;ucceeded to Mon|&s;ieur <PB N="250" REF="129"><HI>de Tyger,</HI> before Con&s;ul at

<HI>France</HI> on the Main Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>At his arrival he &s;aluted <HI>Boulac</HI> with five lit|tle Bra&s;s-Pieces of Canon, which were at the Stern of his Ship. He landed not at the <HI>Douane,</HI> for the Con&s;uls are free from that Vi&s;it, but in a plea&s;ant hou&s;e upon the River, near the <HI>Douane,</HI> until he had got leave from the <HI>Pacha</HI> to go to <HI>Cairo.</HI> As &s;oon as he had received it, he mount|ed on Hor&s;eback without more ado, and rode in|to the City, with all the Merchants of his Nation riding on A&s;&s;es.

<P>The &s;ame day, one of tho&s;e Swimmers, whom I have already mentioned, &s;wum all along the <HI>Calitz,</HI> according to the Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh of the Month, <HI>Ibrahim Pacha</HI> went from

<P>On the 29th, I went with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bonnecor&s;e</HI> to

<P>It is not ami&s;s to mention here two Cu&s;toms, which all the

<P>Every <HI>Pacha,</HI> before he enters into <HI>Cairo,</HI> is bound to vi&s;it the Tomb of <HI>Sciech il Sciafei,</HI> who is buried in the

<P>The&s;e two Cu&s;toms are &s;o Religiou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved by the <HI>Pacha</HI>'s that the people of <HI>Cairo</HI> &s;ay, that they have &s;een &s;ome that have neglected or contemned them, to have been &s;ud|denly depo&s;ed, and to have met with unhappi|ne&s;s in their time.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ay, that when <HI>Sultan Selimus</HI> had overcome the <HI>Mamelucs,</HI> he was afraid to go into <HI>Cairo,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Conque&s;t, till <HI>Sciech il Sciafei</HI> appeared to him, to a&s;&s;ure him, that he need not fear any thing. And that the next day when he made his Entry, an unknown per&s;on led his Hor&s;e by the Bridle into the Town, and then vani&s;h'd away.</P>
<P>When I had continued in &s;o incommodious a City, as
<HI>Cairo</HI> is to the <HI>Francs,</HI> twenty Months, the fear of &s;ome mi&s;hap which might have befallen me if the <HI>Turks</HI> had known that I bought up their Books, cau&s;ed me to think upon my depar|ture; and to &s;ecure my &s;elf, I imagin'd <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> to be the mo&s;t fit for my purpo&s;e. I re&s;ol|ved therefore to go thither: I left <HI>Cairo</HI> the
12th of <HI>October,</HI> 1673. to &s;ail to <HI>Ro&s;etta;</HI> and becau&s;e the River was then fulle&s;t, a good Wind and a &s;trong Current carried us thither in two Nights and a day. From thence, I went aboard the &s;ame
<PB N="252" REF="130">day in a Ve&s;&s;el of a <HI>Greek</HI> bound for
<HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI> I landed at <HI>Chio,</HI> an I&s;land of the
<HI>Archipe|lague,</HI> the 25th of <HI>November,</HI> where I &s;taid two Months and a few days, wondering at the de|light&s;omne&s;s of this I&s;land, and at the Civility of the Inhabitants to Strangers: I went to vi&s;it tho famous Mona&s;tery of the Religious <HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>Neamoni,</HI> or of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed and Only Virgin:</HI> I &s;aw the Library, and all the other Rarities of the I|&s;land. From thence I went to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the
27th of <HI>January,</HI> 1674. where I arrived the &s;econd of
<HI>February,</HI> and &s;taid till the 13th of <HI>March.</HI> Then I went aboard with Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where I arrived the 24th of
<HI>March,</HI> being <HI>Holy Satur|day.</HI></P>
<P>The 24th of <HI>July</HI> I went from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to the City <HI>Brou&s;&s;e,</HI> called by the <HI>Europeans Bur&s;ia,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>Bythinia,</HI> and the ancient Seat of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours, to &s;ee the Hot Baths, the Tombs, and the &s;tately Mo&s;ques of the&s;e Em|perours: I &s;taid there about eight days. On the fourth of <HI>September</HI> I went to the I&s;le of <HI>Chio</HI> the &s;econd time, to &s;ee the gathering up of the <HI>Ma|&s;tick,</HI> a &s;weet Gum, which begins the 14th of this Month, according to the <HI>Greek</HI> computation; and the 28th of <HI>October</HI> I returned to
<HI>Con&s;tanti|nople.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;econd of <HI>January,</HI> 1676. the day that I was to depart with the <HI>Caravan</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> that I might return the third time to <HI>Cairo,</HI> I found my &s;elf oblig'd to go back for
<HI>France;</HI> and be|cau&s;e there was then no <HI>French</HI> Ships in that Ha|ven bound for <HI>France,</HI> only a &s;mall Bark loaden
<PB N="253" REF="130">and bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> which was gone out of the Haven to wait for a good wind at the I&s;lands near by. I went aboard that Ve&s;&s;el, with an in|tent to leave her at the fir&s;t Port of the
<HI>Archi|pelague,</HI> where I might find &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>France.</HI> I found one according to my de&s;ire; for a furious Storm forced us to run into <HI>Suda,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Candy.</HI> The 18th of this Month, I had news from the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul of
<HI>Canea,</HI> that there was a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Provence</HI> ready to &s;et Sail for <HI>Thoulon;</HI> I left therefore my Bark, to ride to <HI>Canea,</HI> in the company of many Per&s;ons on Hor&s;eback, whom the Con&s;ul &s;ent to meet me. The 24th we &s;et fail for <HI>Milo,</HI> where we arrived the 26th day of the Month: There we &s;topt eight days. The 20th of <HI>February</HI> we landed at <HI>Genoa,</HI> where we &s;taid one day; and the 24th of this Month we arrived happily at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> and the 22th of <HI>April</HI> I returned to <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> after five full years Travelling.</P>
