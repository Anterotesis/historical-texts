<HEAD>THE DESIGN OF THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Where he gives a brief Relation of his fir&s;t Travels through the be&s;t parts of <HI>Europe</HI> as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IF the effect of Education may be liken'd to a &s;econd Birth, I may truly &s;ay, that I came into the World with a de&s;ire to travel. The daily di&s;cour&s;es which &s;e|veral Learned men had with my Father upon Geogra|phical &s;ubjects, which my Father had the reputation of under&s;tanding very well, and to which, though ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> young, I was with much delight attentive, in&s;pir'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> betimes with a de&s;ign to &s;ee &s;ome part of tho&s;e Countries, which were repre|&s;ented to me in the Maps, from which I never could keep off my Eyes. By two and twenty years of Age, therefore I had &s;een the faire&s;t Regions of <HI>Europe, France, England,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and I &s;peak indifferently well the Languages mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t generally &s;poken.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;ally was into <HI>England,</HI> where at that time Reigned King <HI>James;</HI> from thence I pa&s;s'd into <HI>Flanders</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Antwerp,</HI> my Father's Native Country, and &s;o into the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where my inclination to travel became the &s;tronger, by rea&s;on of the great Concour&s;e of Stran|gers which I met at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that crouded thither from all parts o the World.</P>
<P>Having &s;een what was mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the united Provinces, I pa&s;s'd into <HI>Germany,</HI> and when I came to <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> by the way of <HI>Frankfort</HI> and <HI>Au&s;purgh,</HI> the noi&s;e of the Armies that were marching into <HI>Bohemia</HI> to retake <HI>Prague,</HI> in&s;till'd into me a de&s;ire to go to the Wars, where I might learn &s;omething that might be u&s;eful to me in the &s;eries of my travels. I was not above a days journey from <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> when I met a Colonel of Hor&s;e, who&s;e name was <HI>Hans Brener&punc;</HI> the Son of <HI>Philip Brener,</HI> Governour of <HI>Vienna,</HI> who engag'd me to follow him into <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Sometime after I bore the &s;ame Colonel company to <HI>Vienna,</HI> who pre&s;ented me to the Governour of <HI>Raab,</HI> his Uncle, then Viceroy of <HI>Hungary</HI> al&s;o; who receiv'd me into his Family as one of his Pages. For it is a u&s;ual thing in <HI>Germany</HI> for Gentlemen's Sons to &s;erve in that quality 'till five and twenty years of age, and &s;eldom to quit that fervice, till they have a Commi&s;&s;ion for a Cornet, or En&s;ign's place. Four years and a half I &s;erv'd the Viceroy, when the Prince of <HI>Mantua</HI> came to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to engage the perour in certain
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
de&s;igns of his own without &s;ucce&s;s. At that time the Count of <HI>Arc,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter the Viceroy had Marry'd, was chief Mini&s;ter to the Prince of <HI>Mantua;</HI> and coming to vi&s;it the Viceroy at <HI>Javarin,</HI> I was ap|pointed to attend him during his &s;tay there. Upon his departure, he told the Viceroy, that the Prince of <HI>Mantua</HI> had no per&s;on about him that under&s;tood the Language, and that therefore he might be &s;ure that the Prince would take it for a great kindne&s;s, to permit me to attend his per&s;on during his &s;tay at the Emperours Court. This was a thing ea&s;ily granted to the Count of <HI>Arc;</HI> who thereupon carri'd one along with him to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where having had the good fortune not to di&s;plea&s;e the Prince, he te&s;tify'd to me at his departure, that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me at <HI>Mantua,</HI> where he would not forget the &s;ervices&punc; I had done him. This pre&s;ently infus'd into me a de&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pe|cially upon the opportunity that offer'd it &s;elf not long after.</P>
<P>For Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Sabran,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Envoy to his Impe|rial Maje&s;ty, being to go for <HI>Venice,</HI> and de&s;irous of one that under|&s;tood the <HI>German</HI> Language to bear him company, I laid hold of the occa&s;ion; &s;o that in eight days we got to <HI>Venice.</HI> While we &s;tay'd at <HI>Venice,</HI> I took a view to my great &s;atisfaction, of that mo&s;t Celebra|ted City, and in regard it is in many things like to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> as in Situation, Greatne&s;s, Magnificence, Commerce, and Concour&s;e of Strangers, my being there did but &s;till reinforce my inclination to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vel.</P>
<P>From <HI>Venice</HI> I went to <HI>Mantua</HI> with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Sabran,</HI> where the rince being glad to &s;ee me again, gave me my choice of an En&s;ign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r of a place in the Company of the Ordonnance of the Duke his Father. accepted the latter as being glad to be under the Command of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de de Guiche,</HI> who was then Captain. At the Siege of <HI>Mantua</HI> I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ike to have been &s;lain, but for the goodne&s;s of a Cuirafs which I had cho&s;en out of the Princes Magazin, being hit with two Bullets above and upon the left pap, which had enter'd, had not my Arms been excel|lent proof: So that after I was recover'd of my Brui&s;es, a longer &s;tay it <HI>Mantua</HI> did not agree with my de&s;ire to travel.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ome time after the Siege was rais'd, I took leave of the rince, who gave me an honourable Pa&s;s, by vertue whereof five or &s;ix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e-men bore me company back to <HI>Venice.</HI> From <HI>Venice</HI> I went to <HI>Lauretta,</HI> from <HI>Lauretta</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> from whence returning to <HI>Rome</HI> again, I &s;taid there ten or twelve dayes. After that I went to &s;ee <HI>Florence, Pi&s;a, Ligorn,</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> from whence I Embark'd for <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> I ha&s;ted to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I could not &s;tay long; for being de&s;irous to &s;ee <HI>Poland,</HI> I pa&s;s'd once more into <HI>Germany</HI> through <HI>Switzerland,</HI> after I had tak'n a &s;urvey of the principal Towns of the <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ons.</HI> I went by the <HI>Rhine</HI> by Water, to vi&s;it <HI>Strasburgh</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;ack;</HI> then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e by Land cro&s;&s;ing <HI>Suabia,</HI> I pa&s;&s;'d through <HI>&V;lme</HI> and <HI>Au&s;purgh</HI> to go to <HI>Munich.</HI> There I &s;aw the Magnificent Palace of the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which <HI>William</HI> the fifth began, and which <HI>Maximilian</HI> his Son fini&s;h'd&punc; in the heat of the Wars that troubl'd the Empire. From thence I went the &s;econd time to <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> and <HI>Prague,</HI> and leaving <HI>Bohemia</HI> I enter'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and pa&s;s'd the <HI>Oder</HI> at <HI>Bre&s;law.</HI> From <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> I went to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> one of the greate&s;t Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> of three Cities, the ancient Seat of the King
<PB REF="3">
of <HI>Poland.</HI> From thence, keeping the <HI>Vi&s;tula</HI> upon the left hand, I went to <HI>War&s;aw</HI> and &s;aw there the Court of King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> which is a noble and &s;plendid Habitation.</P>
<P>From <HI>War&s;aw</HI> I return'd to <HI>Bre&s;law,</HI> taking the Road toward the Lower <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> de&s;igning to vi&s;it one of the principal Officers of the Emperours Hou&s;hold, who was my particular acquaintance. But about two Leagues from <HI>Glogaw,</HI> meeting with Colonel <HI>Butler,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentle|man, Colonel of one of the Emperours Regiment of Hor&s;e, who afterwards kill'd <HI>Walesteyne</HI> in pur&s;uance of the Orders he receiv'd, I gave over my fir&s;t intended journey. His Wife was a great lover of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o that benig earne&s;tly oblig'd by both together, I could not with&s;tand the te&s;timonies of their kindne&s;s. There I under&s;tood that the Emperour was going to <HI>Ratisbone</HI> with his Son <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third, to Crown him King of the <HI>Romans;</HI> &s;o that I, who had &s;een the Coronations of the Kings of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> being &s;o de&s;irous to &s;ee the third Solemnity al&s;o, took leave of my Colonel, and ha&s;ted to <HI>Ratisbone.</HI></P>
<P>At that time arriv'd to <HI>Ratisbone</HI> &s;everal Jewellers, one of which came to his end by an accident &s;o tragical, that all the whole Court pity'd his untimely fate. He was the only Son of one of the riche&s;t Merchants of <HI>Europe,</HI> that liv'd in <HI>Frankfort,</HI> who&s;e Father had &s;ent him with Jewels to &s;ell at the Coronation. For fear of being Robb'd he had convey'd them before into the hands of a <HI>Jew,</HI> in <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> his Corre&s;pondent, to be deliver'd to his Son at his coming. This young man arriving at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> went to the <HI>Jew,</HI> who told him that he had receiv'd a &s;mall Casket of Jewels from his Father, which he might take away, when he pleas'd. At the &s;ame time the <HI>Jew</HI> invited the young man to drink, and carry'd him to a publick Hou&s;e upon the Key of the City, where they continu'd 'till about an hour after day was &s;hut in. At this time, both going out together, the <HI>Jew</HI> led the young man through a private Street where poor people pa&s;s'd by, and there having &s;tab'd him five or &s;ix times in the Belly with a Dagger, left him wallowing in his Blood. A while after, one of the Emperour's Trumpets going that way in the dark, &s;tumbl'd at the Legs of the unfortunate youth, who &s;till breath'd, and fell upon his Body. At fir&s;t feeling his hands wet: he thought it had been &s;ome drunken fellow that had eas'd his &s;tomach; but upon &s;econd thoughts imagining it might be &s;ome wounded per&s;on, he ran and call'd the Officers, who coming with Lanthorns, beheld the tragick &s;pectacle of a youngm man weltring in his own gore. Thereupon the Officers carrying the Body to the &s;ame publick-hou&s;e, as being next at hand, his face was no &s;ooner wa&s;h'd, but the Woman and Maid of the Hou&s;e knew him to be the &s;ame young man that had been there drinking with the <HI>Jew</HI> not long before. But as for the young man he pre&s;ently expir'd, without being able to make the lea&s;t di&s;covery. However the <HI>Jew</HI> was &s;eized that evening, and being &s;eiz'd, confe&s;s'd the Crime. The Imperial Laws ordain, that a <HI>Jew</HI> for killing a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;hould be hung upon a Gibbet by the Heels, and that two fierce Dogs &s;hould be hung by him in the &s;ame manner to the end, that the Dogs in their madne&s;s &s;hould tear out his Bowels. But the <HI>Jew</HI> made &s;uch pre&s;ents to the Empre&s;s that the Sentence was chang'd, though the puni&s;hment was not much le&s;s rigorous. For his fle&s;h was torn with red hot Pincers from &s;everal
<PB REF="4">
parts of his body, in &s;everal Streets of the City, and boyling Lead pour'd into the raw wounds; after which he was broken alive upon the wheel, at the publick place of Execution.</P>
<P>Being upon my departure from <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> I met with Father <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Re&s;ident there for the King of <HI>France,</HI> who knowing me in <HI>Paris,</HI> pro|pos'd to me to go along with the Mon&s;ieur, the Abbot of <HI>Chapes,</HI> Bro|ther of the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Aumont,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>Liebau,</HI> who were then intending for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Pale&s;tine.</HI> I lik'd the propo|&s;ition well, and immediately put my &s;elf into the Society of tho&s;e two Gentlemen, from whom I never &s;eparated 'till they departed for <HI>Syria</HI> from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>But before we left <HI>Germany,</HI> we re&s;olv'd to &s;ee the Court of <HI>Savony,</HI> whither we got in a few days, By the way we pa&s;s'd through <HI>Frey|bergh,</HI> a &s;mall City, but well worth &s;eeing, for the beauty of the Electors Tombs, and mo&s;t &s;plendid and magnificent both for Materials and Workman&s;hip in all <HI>Europe.</HI> From thence we went and view'd the &s;tately Ca&s;tle of <HI>Augu&s;tburgh,</HI> &s;eated upon a high Mountain, where|in among other things there is a great Hall, adorn'd from top to bot|tom with nothing but Horns fa&s;ten'd to the Wall; among the re&s;t is the Head of a Hare with two Horns, &s;ent the Elector by the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> for a great Rarity. In one of the Courts of the Palace &s;tands a Tree &s;o large in Body, and &s;preading out the Branches at &s;o wide a di&s;tance, that they will cover three hundred &s;ixty five Tables with their &s;hade. And that which makes this Tree more wonderfull is, that it is only&punc; Birch, that rarely grows to that Immen&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Dre&s;de</HI> is the Re&s;idence of the Elector, a little City, but a very neat one, and well fortify'd; with a Stone a Bridge over the <HI>Elbe,</HI> that parts the Old and New Town. The Palace is one of the large&s;t and faire&s;t in <HI>Germany.</HI> But it wants a <HI>Piazza</HI> before it, the Principal Gate &s;tan|ding ju&s;t at the bottom of a narrow Lane.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dre&s;de</HI> we went to <HI>Prague,</HI> which was a third time that I &s;aw that great and fair City, or rather three Cities together, only &s;apara|ted by the <HI>Molda,</HI> that throws it &s;elf into the <HI>Elbe,</HI> &s;ome five or &s;ix Leagues below.</P>
<P>Having travers'd <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and touch'd upon the corner of <HI>Moravia,</HI> we enter'd <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and came to <HI>Vienna,</HI> re&s;olving there to Embark with all &s;peed, becau&s;e the Winter came on.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd one day at <HI>Presburgh</HI> to &s;ee the great Church, and &s;ome Relicks which they &s;hew'd us, and from thence fell down to <HI>Altenburgh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Altenburgh</HI> is a City and Province belonging to the Count of <HI>Arach.</HI> It was the Childs part of one of the Queens of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who upon her death-bed bequeathed it to one of the Lords of her Court, upon condition that he and his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould always keep &s;uch a number of Peacocks; for defect whereof, the Territory &s;hould revert to the Crown.</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ence we came to <HI>Signet,</HI> from whence I took a little Boat and ha&s;ted to <HI>Raab,</HI> where I did my Devoirs to the Viceroy, who was glad to &s;ee me, and gave noble entertainment to the <HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs de Chapes,</HI> and <HI>de St. Liebau.</HI> Here we &s;taid eight or ten days for the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI>'s An&s;wer, whether he would give liberty to two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, to pa&s;s with their Train through his Garri&s;on or no; which being return'd
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
&s;uch as we could de&s;ire, we Embark'd at <HI>Comorra</HI> in a &s;ort of Bigran|tines well fitted for defence and convenience.</P>
<P>From <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Javarin</HI> we lay three dayes upon the water, by rea&s;on of the great turnings and winding of the <HI>Danaw.</HI> Leaving <HI>Javarin</HI> we lay at <HI>Comorra;</HI> and from <HI>Commorra</HI> we row'd to <HI>Buda</HI> in two days. For the Road by Land is &s;eldom travell'd in regard that the Frontiers of both Empires are full of Thieves and Boothaylers. In fair weather you may go from <HI>Buda</HI> to <HI>Belgrade</HI> in le&s;s than eight dayes, but we were forc'd to &s;tay longer upon the Water, in regard of the Cold wea|ther.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom in <HI>Hungary,</HI> that in all Roads little frequented by Strangers, not to take any Money of the Travellers; For the Burghers lodge and entertain them civilly, for which the Burgo Ma&s;ter at the years end repays them out of the publick &s;tock. But be&s;ides, that they are not troubl'd with many Pa&s;&s;engers; <HI>Hungary,</HI> which is one of the be&s;t Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> affords provi&s;ion at &s;o cheap a rate, that to <HI>Belgrade</HI> it co&s;ts us not above two Crowns a day for fourteen people.</P>
<P><HI>Buda</HI> &s;tands upon the right hand of the <HI>Danaw,</HI> about half an hours travelling from the River. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> being advis'd of our arrival, &s;ent his Squire with led Hor&s;es, and &s;everal &s;laves in very good Live|ries to conduct us to the Town. And though we &s;tay'd twelve days before we could &s;peak with him, by rea&s;on of his being &s;ick at that time, yet he allow'd us a fair provi&s;ion of Mutton, Pullets, Rice, Butter, and Bread, and two <HI>Sequins</HI> a day for &s;mall expences. He was a comly per&s;on, and of a hand&s;om carriage and at our depar|ture, he &s;ent &s;ix <HI>Cale&s;hes</HI> with two <HI>Spahi's</HI> to conduct us to <HI>Balgrade,</HI> with order to defray our expences, which would by no means be accepted,</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Belgrade</HI> we found the <HI>Sangiai</HI> as rude, as we had found the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> civil before. For he made a ridiculous demand of two hun|dred Ducats a Head, and for fifteen days prolong'd the conte&s;t. But at length I &s;o terrify'd him, by threatning to &s;end our Complaints to the <HI>Ottaman</HI> Port, of his ill u&s;age of two Gentlemen, Kin&s;men to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> that he was contented with fifty Ducats for all. <HI>Belgrade</HI> is &s;ituated upon a point of Land, where two great Rivers, the <HI>Danaw</HI> and the <HI>Sava</HI> meet; and is furni&s;hed with Wine, Bread, and all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions at a cheap rate.</P>
<P>From <HI>Belgrade</HI> we took &s;ome &s;addle Hor&s;es, &s;ome Coaches for <HI>Adria|nople,</HI> as every one lik'd be&s;t. We pa&s;s'd through <HI>Sophia,</HI> a large and well peopl'd City, the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Ancient <HI>Bulgarians,</HI> and the re&s;idence of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Romeli.</HI> In it &s;tands a fair <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which hath been a Chri&s;tian Church, built with &s;o much Art, that three men may go up to the top of the Steeple, and not &s;ee one ano|ther.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sophia</HI> we came to <HI>Philippoli,</HI> between which Town and <HI>Adri|anople</HI> we met with two Troops of <HI>Tartars</HI> well mounted. When they &s;aw us, they made a Lane for us to pa&s;s through them, with a de&s;ign mo&s;t certainly to have fall'n upon us; &s;ince they could not hope to do any good upon us, but by &s;urprize and number; for they were ill provided of Weapons, and we rarely well well Arm'd. There|upon we alighted and Barricado'd up our &s;elves with our Chariots.

In the mean time we &s;ent our <HI>Saphi's</HI> to the Commander of tho&s;e <HI>Tartars,</HI> to tell them, we would not &s;tir 'till they were gone, and that being Souldiers as they were, they could not hope for any booty from us. The Commander an&s;wer'd, that he had divided his men in that manner only to do us Honour; but &s;ince we de&s;ir'd they &s;hould be gone, they reque&s;ted us but to &s;end them a little Tobacco. A boon which we rea|dily granted them, and &s;o we pa&s;s'd on.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>Adrianople</HI> the three and twentieth day after we par|ted from <HI>Belgrade. Adrianople</HI> takes its name from the Emperour <HI>Adri|an,</HI> being formerly call'd <HI>Ore&s;tes.</HI> It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated at the mouth of three Rivers that throw them&s;elves into the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The old Town is not very big, but the <HI>Turks</HI> dayly enlarge the Suburbs, be|ing a place which the Grand <HI>Signors</HI> very much delight in for the plea&s;ures of Hunting and Hawking, e&s;pecially, at the wild Duck and Heron.</P>
<P>The fifth day after we departed from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and the forty &s;econd after we departed from <HI>Vienna,</HI> we happily arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ing through the City over to <HI>Galata,</HI> went to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e. While we &s;tay'd there to winter, he made a &s;mall Voyage to the <HI>Dardanells,</HI> to the Ruins of <HI>Troy,</HI> where we be|held nothing but Stones, not worth the while of going &s;o far to &s;ee. Another day we took three Barks and Sail'd to <HI>Calcedon,</HI> that lies upon the Sea. There is in it a very ancient Church; and they &s;hew'd us the Room where the Council was held, with the &s;ame Chairs which were then made u&s;e of. Now it is only a Mone&s;tary, where two Bi&s;hops after they had &s;hew'd us what they could, hand&s;omly enter|tain'd us.</P>
<P>Then we went to view <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pillar at the mouth of the <HI>Black</HI> Sea. Concerning the Channel of which Sea, I mu&s;t make one Ob|&s;ervation; that though there be no part of the Sea but has one Current, yet this has two quite contrary one to another. That part next to <HI>Europe</HI> carries the Ve&s;&s;el to the <HI>Black</HI> Sea; and that next <HI>A&s;ia</HI> brings it back again to the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> So that you have no more to do but to cro&s;s over from one Shore to the other.</P>
<P>The Winter being over, the two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen pur&s;u'd their Voyage for <HI>Alexandretta.</HI> But for my part, I having another de&s;ign in my head, &s;tay'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in expectation of of a <HI>Caravan,</HI> which the people told me from Month to Month was coming. I was then ignorant, and did not under&s;tand that every year there were five or &s;ix <HI>Caravans</HI> that went from <HI>Bur&s;a.</HI> Be&s;ides, that &s;ometime eight or ten Merchants travelling together, might go &s;afe to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Which ignorence of mine made me &s;tay longer than I intended. At length, after I had continu'd eleven Months in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I de|parted with a fair and numerous <HI>Caravan</HI> for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which was the fir&s;t time I travell'd into <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> After that I made five others, wherein, I had time better to under&s;tand the Qualities of the Countries, and the Genius of the People. The three la&s;t times I went beyond <HI>Gau|ges,</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>Java;</HI> &s;o that for the &s;pace of &s;orty years, I have travell'd above &s;ixty thou&s;and Leagues by Land; never retur|ning but once into <HI>Europe</HI> by Sea. And thus in my &s;ix Voyages, and by travelling different Roads, I had the lei&s;ure and opportunity
<PB REF="5">
to &s;ee all <HI>Turky,</HI> all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and all <HI>India,</HI> particularly the famous Diamond Mines, where no <HI>European</HI> had been before me. Of the&s;e three great Empires therefore have I re&s;olv'd to make an ample and exact De&s;cription: and I will begin with the &s;everal Roads which may be ta|ken from <HI>Paris</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Roads from <HI>France</HI> to the hither parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the Places from whence they u&s;ually &s;et out for <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_A Man cannot travel in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as they do in <HI>Europe;</HI> nor at the &s;ame Hours, nor with the &s;ame ea&s;e. There are no weekly Coaches or Wagons from Town to Town; be&s;ides, that the Soil of the Countries is of &s;everal natures. In <HI>A&s;ia</HI> you &s;hall meet with &s;everal Regions untill'd and unpeopl'd, either through the badne&s;s of the Climate and Soil, or the &s;loth of the Inhabitants, who rather choo&s;e to live mi&s;erably, than to work. There are va&s;t De&s;erts to cro&s;s, and very dangerous, both for want of Water, and the Robberies that the <HI>Arabs</HI> daily commit therein. There are no certain Stages, or Inns to entertain Travellers. The be&s;t Inns, e&s;pecially in <HI>Turkie,</HI> are the Tents which you carry along with you, and your Ho&s;ts are your Servants, that get ready tho&s;e Victuals which you have bought in good Towns. You &s;et up your Tent in the open Field, or in any Town where there is no Inn: and a good &s;hift too in temperate weather, when the Sun is not too hot, or that it does not rain. In the <HI>Carvan&s;era</HI>'s or Inns which are more frequent in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> than in <HI>Turkie,</HI> there are per&s;ons that furni&s;h you with Provi&s;ions, and the fir&s;t come are be&s;t &s;erved. As for <HI>Turkie</HI> it is full of Thieves, that keep in Troops together, and way-lay the Merchants upon the Roads, and if they be not very well guarded will certainly rob them: nay many times murder them. A mi&s;|chief prevented in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by the well order'd convenience which is provided for Travellers. To avoid the&s;e dangers and inconveniences, you are oblig'd to &s;tay
<PB N="2" REF="11">
for the <HI>Caravans,</HI> that go for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> or the <HI>Indies,</HI> which never &s;et out but at certain times, and from certain places.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Caravans</HI> &s;et out from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> and <HI>Aleppo.</HI> And it is from one of the&s;e Cities that a Traveller mu&s;t &s;et out, that intends for <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> whether he keeps company with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> or will hazard him&s;elf alone with a Guide, as once I did.</P>
<P>I will begin with <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> from whence you may go either by Land or Sea: and either by Land or Sea there are two ways to go. The fir&s;t of the&s;e by Land is that which I took with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chapes</HI> and Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>Liebau,</HI> By the way take notice, that <HI>Vienna</HI> is the half-way near-upon between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The &s;econd Road is le&s;s frequented, but is le&s;s inconvenient and le&s;s dangerous: for there are need of the Emperour's Pa&s;ports, which he does not grant very freely: be&s;ides that here is no fear of the Pirates of <HI>Tunis</HI> or <HI>Argier,</HI> as when you embarque from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> or <HI>Ligorn.</HI> If you intend this way, you mu&s;t go to <HI>Venice;</HI> from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Ancona,</HI> from whence &s;everal Barques are bound every Week for <HI>Ragu&s;a.</HI> From <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> you &s;ail along by the Shore to <HI>Durazzo</HI> a Sea&punc;Port of <HI>Albania;</HI> from whence you travel the re&s;t of the way by Land. From <HI>Durazzo</HI> to <HI>Albanopolis,</HI> di&s;tant three days journey, from thence to <HI>Mone&s;tier,</HI> ju&s;t as far; from <HI>Mone&s;tier</HI> you may either take the left hand through <HI>Sophia,</HI> and <HI>Philippopolis,</HI> or the right through <HI>Ingui&s;cher,</HI> three days journey from <HI>Mone&s;tier,</HI> and ten from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> from whence in five days you reach <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> through <HI>Selivrea.</HI></P>
<P>This la&s;t way is part by Sea and part by Land: but there are two other ways alto|gether by Land, above and below <HI>Italy,</HI> according to the di&s;tinction which Antiquity made of the two Seas that almo&s;t encompa&s;s it. You may embark at <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;ayling along the Gulf which is free from Pirates, you mu&s;t double the Cape of <HI>Matapan,</HI> the mo&s;t Southern Point of all <HI>Europe,</HI> to enter into the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The other way is from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> or <HI>Ligorn,</HI> from whence &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els are bound for the Ea&s;t. The &s;afe&s;t way is to go along with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> Fleets, that u|&s;ually arrive at <HI>Ligorn</HI> either in the Spring or in Autumn, and part ju&s;t again&s;t the <HI>Morea,</HI> to the &s;everal parts whither they are bound. As the Wind &s;erves, tho&s;e Fleets &s;ometimes make Sail between the I&s;land of <HI>Elba</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and by the Tower of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina&punc;</HI> &s;ometimes below <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardigna,</HI> within &s;ight of <HI>Malta.</HI> Thus you mu&s;t come within &s;ight of <HI>Candy,</HI> whether you are bound for <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> or <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> from whence it is but three days journey to <HI>Aleppo:</HI> from one of which three Cities, you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily begin your journey, if you intend for <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Some take <HI>Egypt</HI> in their way, u&s;ing through <HI>Alexandria, Cairo,</HI> and <HI>Damiata,</HI> whence &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els are bound for <HI>Joppa;</HI> or St. <HI>John</HI>'s of <HI>Aera,</HI> which is not far off: from thence to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> or <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>If you will venture in a &s;ingle Ve&s;&s;el not &s;taying for the Fleets, you may hire a Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Ligorn</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> from <HI>Naples</HI> to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> keeping along by the Shore, and lying a &s;hore every night. I took this way, and went from <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> to <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> where are to be &s;een the mo&s;t remarkable foot&s;teps of Antiquity. 'Tis like a City under ground, and near to it is a great Rock which has been made hollow, at the bottom whereof if a man whi&s;per, they that are at the top may hear him. They call this Rock <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the Tyrant's Ear: for being at the top, he ea&s;ily under&s;tood what the People &s;aid of him below; and di&s;covered the Coun&s;els of the chief Men of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> whom he kept pri&s;oners there. <HI>Syraecu&s;e</HI> has nothing of that &s;plendour which renown'd it when it was the Mi&s;tre&s;s of all <HI>Sicily,</HI> and when <HI>Greece,</HI> jealous of her power, made War upon her. But the Soil is very plentiful, and the Gallies of <HI>Malta</HI> very often take in their Provi&s;ions there. Near the City is a fair Convent of <HI>Capuchin</HI> Friers, going out of which, you may walk for half an hour between two very high Rocks, where there are &s;everal little Cells with every one a Garden, where the Friers &s;ometimes retire, and it is certainly one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Solitudes in the World.</P>
<P>From <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> I went to <HI>Malta,</HI> where you mu&s;t wait for &s;ome Ship that is bound for the Ea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Road from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which the Author kept in his fir&s;t Travels into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;eldom that any <HI>Caravans</HI> go from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but from <HI>Bur|&s;a</HI> they go every two Months: <HI>Bur&s;a</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> not a|bove three days journey from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or a little more. The&s;e two Roads meet at <HI>Chabangi,</HI> where you may be from <HI>Bur&s;a</HI> in two Days: and &s;o I will only &s;peak of the Roads from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> This Journey is to be under|taken either with the <HI>Caravan</HI> of Camels, or el&s;e ten or twelve Men in a Company, well mounted and well arm'd.</P>
<P>From <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> you cro&s;s over to <HI>Scutari,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Setting out from <HI>Scutari,</HI> the fir&s;t days journey is very plea&s;ant, over Fields gayly painted with Flowers in their &s;ea&s;on. At fir&s;t for &s;ome time together, one both &s;ides the way, you &s;ee nothing but fair Sepulchers with their Pyramids, and you may ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Womens Monuments from the Mens. For there is a Turbant upon the Pyramid of the Mens Sepulcher, but the Pyramids of the Womens Monuments are trimm'd with the Head-Attire which is worn by the Women of the Country. That Evening you mu&s;t lye at <HI>Cartali,</HI> a Village of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> the next Day at <HI>Ge|bi&s;a,</HI> antiently <HI>Lybi&s;&s;a,</HI> famous for the Tomb of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> In that place there are two good Inns, and two fair Fountains.</P>
<P>The third day you come to <HI>I&s;nich,</HI> which is thought to be the ancient <HI>Nicea;</HI> one part of the City is built upon the de&s;cent of a Hill, the other part upon a Plain that reaches to the Sea, and makes the <HI>Golf of I&s;nich.</HI> The Haven con&s;i&s;ts of two Moles made of Free-&s;tone, and three great Enclo&s;ures encompa&s;s'd with Walls, which &s;erve in&s;tead of &s;o many Ar&s;enals, wherein there are Store hou&s;es full of large Timber, for building Hou&s;es and Galleys. The Country round about being an excellent place for Hunting, and the Soil bearing rare Fruits, and rich in Wine, caus'd <HI>Sultan Amuratt</HI> to build a <HI>Seraglio</HI> in the highe&s;t part of the Town, from whence there is a pro&s;pect at the &s;ame time both over the Sea and the Country. The <HI>Jews</HI> inhabit the greate&s;t part of the Town, dealing chiefly in Timber and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">. When the Wind ferves, you may go from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>I&s;nich</HI> in &s;even or eight Hours, there being no danger in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The fourth Day you &s;tay at <HI>Chabangi,</HI> a &s;mall Town built upon the &s;ide of a Lake call'd <HI>Chaban Gigul,</HI> where there are two Inns. From the beginning of the Lake for two Leagues together you travel partly over Mountains, partly by the Lake|&s;ide, where in &s;ome places the Hor&s;e will be up to the Belly. This Lake is not above ten Leagues in compa&s;s; but it yields great &s;tore of large Fi&s;h, in&s;omuch that I have bought a Pike two Foot and a half long for three <HI>Sous.</HI> Many Emperours have had a de&s;ign to make a Cutt out of this Lake into the Sea, for the more ea&s;ie tran&s;|porting to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the Timber which grows upon the Mountains near the Lake. And if the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who by a Miracle dy'd in his Bed, and left his Son &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to his Employment, had liv'd &s;ome Years longer, he had no que&s;tion added this to the re&s;t of tho&s;e famous Wotks that eterniz'd his Memory.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Chabangi,</HI> you come to lye at Night upon the Bank of a River call'd <HI>Zacarat,</HI> which runs Northward and falls into the <HI>Black Sea.</HI> It is a River plentiful in Fi&s;h, and you cro&s;s over it with a wooden Bridge. There is neither Town, nor Inn in that place; but a League from the River is a great Town call'd <HI>Ada,</HI> the chiefe&s;t part of the Inhabitants whereof are <HI>Armemians.</HI> Thither we &s;ent for excellent good Wine, and other nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>From that River to <HI>Cancoli,</HI> where you lye the next Night, and have your choice of four Inns; you travel all the day in the Mer&s;hes, over wooden Bridges and Cau&s;eys.</P>
<P><HI>Tuskeba&s;ar</HI> is the next place, a &s;mall Village with two Inns. From thence to <HI>Car|gue&s;lar,</HI> a great Town, with one Inn, built upon a River, where there is great &s;tore of Fi&s;h taken, which the Inhabitants call <HI>Bourma-balouky,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the
<PB N="4" REF="12" MS="y">
Fi&s;h with the long No&s;e: It is &s;peckl'd like a Trout; but of a better ta&s;t, and more e&s;teem'd. <HI>Polia</HI> or <HI>Polis,</HI> is a City &s;eated at the foot of &s;everal Mountains, the Inhabitants whereof are for the mo&s;t part <HI>Greeks.</HI> The&s;e Mountains are very high, and extend them&s;elves along the Road for Two days journey. They are full of &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, which are &s;treight and tall like Firr-Trees: and divided by &s;o many Torrents, which it would be hard to pa&s;s over, where it not for the Bridges that the Grand Vi&s;ier <HI>Kuprigli</HI> caus'd to be built. In regard the &s;oil of the&s;e Moun|tains is very fat, there would be no drawing for the Hor&s;es after great Rains or the melting of the Snow, had not the &s;ame Vi&s;ier caus'd all the Ways to be Pav'd and Pitch'd, even as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> A Work of great charge, in regard there is not a Flint in any part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ountain, and for that the Stone is to fetch'd a great way off. There are abundance of Pigeons as big as Hens, and of an excellent ta&s;t, which not only pleas'd our Appetites, but afforded us very good Pa&s;time to &s;hoot them. Between the City and the Mountain, there is a Plain about two Leagues in length; near to which, there glides a River that waters it, and very much contributes to its fertility. It is an excellent Soil, and produces all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane Life. Upon each &s;ide of the way I counded above Twenty Churchyards&punc; For it is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Turks</HI> to bury near the Highway, be|lieving that the Travellers pray for the Souls of the deceas'd. Upon every Tomb, there is to be &s;een a Marble Pillar, half fix'd in the Earth: of which Pillars there are &s;o great a number, of various Colours, that it is from thence conjectur'd, that there were a very great number of Chri&s;tian Churches in <HI>Polia,</HI> and the parts there|abouts. They a&s;&s;ur'd me likewi&s;e, that there was a va&s;t quantity of the&s;e Pillars in the Villages up and down in the Mountains which the <HI>Turks</HI> every day pull down and &s;et up their Tombs.</P>
<P><HI>Bendourlour</HI> is a Village in the Mountains where there is one Inn.</P>
<P><HI>Gerradar</HI> is beyond the Mountains, where there are two Inns.</P>
<P><HI>Carge&s;lar</HI> has two Inns, and lyes in a good Country.</P>
<P><HI>Caragaler</HI> is a Town where there are two Inns.</P>
<P><HI>Co&s;izar</HI> is a Village with one Inn.</P>
<P><HI>Tocia</HI> is a great City &s;ituated upon ri&s;ing Hills, that joyn to very high Moun|tains. Upon the Winter We&s;t, there appears a fair Champain Country, water'd by a Stream that falls into a River of a greater bigne&s;s, call'd <HI>Gu&s;elarmac.</HI> Upon the highe&s;t of the &s;maller Hills toward the Ea&s;t, there is a Forte&s;s, where a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> re&s;ides; and in the Town is one of the faire&s;t Inns upon the Road. The greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants are Chri&s;tian <HI>Greeks,</HI> who have the advantage to drink ex|cellent Wine, with which the Country furni&s;hes them in abundanee.</P>
<P><HI>Agi&s;en&s;alou</HI> &s;tands upon a River, and there is an Inn and a fair Mo&s;quee in it.</P>
<P><HI>Ozeman</HI> is a little City &s;eated at the foot of a Hill, upon which there &s;tands a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, and below two very commodious Inns. The River <HI>Gu&s;elarmac,</HI> broad and deep, wa&s;hes the South-&s;ide of the City, which you cro&s;s over one of the faire&s;t Bridges that ever was &s;een. It con&s;i&s;ts of Fifteen Arches, all of Free|&s;tone, and is a work that &s;hews the Grandeur of the Undertaker. Somewhat at a di&s;tance from the Bridge &s;tands Six Corn-Mills all together, with little wooden Bridges to go from one to another. This River falls into the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea, about eight days journey from <HI>Ozeman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Azilar</HI> is a great Town, where there are two Inns.</P>
<P><HI>Delekiras</HI> is a great Village, with one Inn.</P>
<P>The&s;e Four days Journeys are very dangerous, by rea&s;on that the Ways are narrow, and commodious for Robbers. They are very numerous in this Country; and therefore under&s;tanding that we were way-laid, we &s;ent and de&s;ir'd a Convoy of the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who lent us fifty Hor&s;emen.</P>
<P><HI>Ama&s;ia</HI> is a great City, built upon an a&s;cent in the hollow of a Mountain. It has no pro&s;pect, but only from the South over a fair Plain. The River that runs by it comes from <HI>Tocat,</HI> and throws it &s;elf into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> four days journey from <HI>Ama&s;ia.</HI> You cro&s;s it over a wooden Bridge, &s;o narrow that not above three per&s;ons can go a-bre&s;t. To bring fre&s;h Water to the City, they have cut a League into Rocks as hard as Marble, which was a prodigious Labour. On the We&s;t-&s;ide, upon a high Mountain, &s;tands a Fortre&s;s, where they can come by no other Water than
<PB N="5" REF="12">
what they pre&s;erve in Ci&s;terns when it rains. In the middle of the Mountain is a fair Spring, and round about it are &s;everal Chambers cut out of the Rock, where the <HI>Dervichs</HI> made their abode. There are but two Inns, and tho&s;e very bad ones, in <HI>Ama&s;ia.</HI> But the &s;oil is good, and bears the be&s;t Wine and Fruits in all <HI>Natolia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ainabachar,</HI> is the name of an Inn, di&s;tant a quarter of a League from a great Town where they fetch their Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Turcall</HI> is a great Town near to a Mountain, upon which there &s;tands a Ca&s;tle. The River that comes from <HI>Tocat</HI> wa&s;hes the Hou&s;es, and we caught excellent Fi&s;h in it. In that place is another of the faire&s;t Inns upon the Road.</P>
<P>From <HI>Turcall</HI> you may travel in one day to <HI>Tocat,</HI> where the Road from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> meets.</P>
<P><HI>Tocat</HI> is a good fair City built at the foot of a very high Mountain, &s;preading it &s;elf round about a great Rock that &s;tands almo&s;t in the mid&s;t of the Town, upon the top whereof a high Ca&s;tle commands the neighbouring parts, with a good Garri&s;on in it. It is very ancient, and the remainder of three others that &s;tood there in former times. The City is very well inhabited with <HI>Turks,</HI> who are the Lord Con|trollers, <HI>Armenians, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> The Streets are very narrow, but the Hou&s;es are indifferent well built; and and among &s;everal Mo&s;quees, there is one very magnificient, which &s;eems to be newly rear'd. There was al&s;o a very fair Inn going up, which when I la&s;t travell'd that way, was not quite fini&s;h'd. There is one thing more particular and more commodious at <HI>Tocat,</HI> which is not to be found in any Inns upon the Road, That round about all the <HI>Caravan&s;era's</HI> in the Town, there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">odgings which they let out to Merchants, that de&s;ire to be by them&s;elves out of the noi&s;e and hurry of the <HI>Caravans,</HI> whiles they &s;tay at <HI>Tocat.</HI> Be&s;ides that, in tho&s;e private Lodgings you have your liberty to drink Wine, and provide for the re&s;t of your Journey; which is not &s;o ea&s;ily done in the publick Inns, where the <HI>Turks</HI> will have an eye upon the Merchants, to draw Money out of their pockets. The Chri&s;tians have twelve Churches at <HI>Tocat,</HI> and there re&s;ides an Archbi&s;hop, that has under him &s;even Suffragans. There are al&s;o two Mona&s;teries for Men, and two for Women; and for fourteen or fifteen Leagues round <HI>Tocat,</HI> the Country is all inhabited by <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians, but very few <HI>Greeks</HI> being intermix'd among them. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e Chri&s;tians are Trade&s;men, and for the mo&s;t part Smiths. A fair River runs about half a quarter of a League from the City, which ri&s;es near to <HI>Erzerom,</HI> and is cro&s;s'd at <HI>Tocat</HI> over a very beautiful &s;tone Bridge. Upon the North &s;ide of the City, it waters a Plain three or four days Journey in extent, and two or three Leagues broad. It is very fertil, and repleni&s;h'd with fair Vil|lages very well peopl'd. A man may live very cheap at <HI>Tocat:</HI> the Wine is mo&s;t excellent, and all &s;ort of rare Fruit very plentiful. It is the only place in all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> where plenty of Saffron grows, which is the be&s;t Commodity you can carry to the <HI>Indies,</HI> where a Pound, as the Years fall out, is worth thirteen or fourteen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Every Frank being 2 <HI>s.</HI> &s;terling.</NOTE>Franks, though the Wax that pre&s;erves it, be as much in weight as the Saffron. This City, with the Lands belonging to it, u&s;ually is the Dowager <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es</HI> Joynture. There is only an <HI>Aga</HI> and a <HI>Cady,</HI> that command there in the behalf of the Grand <HI>Signor:</HI> for the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> from whom they receive their Orders, lives at <HI>Sivas,</HI> which is the ancient <HI>Seba&s;tia,</HI> and a very great City, &s;ome three days journey from <HI>Tocat.</HI> In &s;hort, <HI>Tocat</HI> is one of the mo&s;t remarkable Thoroughfares in the Ea&s;t, where are continually lodg'd the <HI>Caravans</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia, Diarbequer, Bagdat, Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna, Synopus,</HI> and other places; and here the <HI>Caravans</HI> turn off, as they are variou&s;ly bound. They that are for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> take to the Winter We&s;t upon the right hand; they that are for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> incline to the Summer We&s;t, upon the left hand. When you &s;et out either way out of <HI>Tocat,</HI> there is a Toll-gatherer that counts all the Camels and Hor&s;es that pa&s;s by, and exacts for every Camel a quarter of a Rixdollar, and for every Hor&s;e half as much. As for the Hor&s;es or Camels that carry the Pa&s;&s;engers or their Provi&s;ions, they pay nothing. This con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ual concour&s;e of the <HI>Caravans</HI> trolls the Money about at <HI>Tocat,</HI> and makes it one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Cities of <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>Setting out of <HI>Tocat</HI> to go to <HI>Erzerom,</HI> you di&s;cover a little Village &s;o &s;ituated under a Hill, as if the Mountain lay atop of it; and between that Mountain and the River, the Road is very narrow where the <HI>Caravan</HI> is to pa&s;s. In this Road it was, that we met the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> returning from Hunting, with a Train of four
<PB N="6" REF="13" MS="y">
hundred men: &s;o &s;oon as he perceiv'd us, he fil'd off all his men to give us liberty to pa&s;s by. But among all the Company, there was not above four <HI>Franks</HI> upon which he particularly ca&s;t his Eye; which made him &s;end for the <HI>Caravan Bacchi</HI> to know who we were. The <HI>Caravan Bacchi,</HI> to avoid the ill Con&s;equences of jealou&s;ie which the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> might have of the <HI>Franks,</HI> at a time when the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> made War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> told him we were <HI>Jews;</HI> at which the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> &s;haking his Head, reply'd only that we did not look like &s;uch, and happy it was for us that he took reply'd only that we did not look like &s;uch, and happy it was for us that he took no farther notice. For it was twenty to one, but that upon better con&s;ideration he might have &s;ent after us to have &s;topt us. But when he came home to his Lodging he found a <HI>Capigi</HI> &s;taying for him, with Orders from the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> to take off his Head, which were pre&s;ently executed. For <HI>Amurath</HI> being troubl'd for the lo&s;s of his Army, had no way but to revenge him&s;elf upon the per&s;on that had the command of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that the <HI>Caravans</HI> re&s;t at <HI>Tocat,</HI> yet they &s;tay likewi&s;e two or three days at <HI>Charkliqueu,</HI> which is not above two Leagues di&s;tant from it; for <HI>Charkliqueu</HI> is a great Town in a lovely Country, between two fertil Hills, where there grows excellent Wine. It is for the mo&s;t part inhabited by Chri&s;tians, who are generally Tanners. The fine blew Goat leather Skins being dre&s;t in <HI>Tocat,</HI> and the Parts thereabout. It is thought the Water contributes very much to their Art. For <HI>Tocat</HI> is as famous for the blew Goats&punc; leather Skins, as <HI>Diarbequir</HI> and <HI>Bagdat</HI> are for the red, <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul</HI> or the ancient <HI>Ninivch</HI> for the yellow, and <HI>Ourfa</HI> for the black. About two thou&s;and Paces from this Town, in the mid&s;t of a Plain ri&s;es a va&s;t Rock, upon the North-&s;ide whereof you a&s;cend about nine or ten &s;teps into a Chamber with a Bed, a Table, and a Cupboard in it, all hewn out of the Rock. Upon the We&s;t &s;ide you a&s;cend other five or &s;ix &s;teps that lead to a little Gallery, about five or &s;ix Foot long, and three broad, all hewn out of the Rock, though it be of an extroardinary hardne&s;s. The Chri&s;tians affirm that St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> made this Rock his retiring-place during his Exilement, and that he had no other Bed or Bol&s;ter than the Rock it &s;elf, in a place where they &s;hew you the print of a Man's Body. Hence it is, that the <HI>Caravans,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of Chri&s;tian Merchants, &s;tay at <HI>Charkliqueu,</HI> to pay their Devotions to this Rock, where the Bi&s;hop of the place, attended by &s;ome Prie&s;ts, with every one a Taper in their Hands, goes and &s;ays Ma&s;s. But the main Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e there grows excellent Wine in this place, which being cheaper by half here, than it is at <HI>Tocat,</HI> obliges the <HI>Armenians</HI> to &s;top here, to provide them&s;elves for the re&s;t of their Journey.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Charliqueu,</HI> you cro&s;s over very high Mountains, with Pre|cipices on both &s;ides. It is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> when they hear of the approach of a <HI>Caravan,</HI> to ride out two or three days journey to meet their Coun|try-men and carry them fre&s;h Provi&s;ions. The&s;e of <HI>Charliqueu</HI> coming to meet our <HI>Caravan,</HI> three of the <HI>Armenians</HI> took a large Morning&punc;draughts, which made them &s;o Pot&punc;valiant, that they would needs ride before to the Town alone by them|&s;elves; but by the way they were &s;et upon by &s;ix Hor&s;e men that came from the North, where there are higher Mountains than tho&s;e which we were to cro&s;s. Imme|diately the Thieves darted their Half-Pikes at the <HI>Armenians,</HI> in &s;o much that two of them fell down mortally wounded, and the other &s;av'd him&s;elf among the Rocks, but the Thieves got their Hor&s;es and Goods, which were valu'd at ten thou|&s;and Crowns. The <HI>Caravan</HI> at the top of the Hill beheld the misfortune of tho&s;e poor men which their own folly had brought upon them, but could not help them, by rea&s;on of the narrowne&s;s of the ways; be&s;ides, that the Thieves knowing all the by-turnings, were pre&s;ently out of &s;ight. And therefore it is a dangerous thing to leave the Body of the <HI>Caravans,</HI> either by &s;taying too far behind, or running too fa&s;t before: and &s;ome have &s;uffer'd for di&s;tancing them&s;elves not above five hun|dred Paces from it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravans</HI> do not not make their Journeys all alike; but come to their Stages &s;ometimes &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later, according as they meet with Waters and Inns, or places fit to pitch their Tents in, to which places the Natives bring Provi&s;ion and Provender from the Mountains. There are &s;ome places where there is a nece&s;|&s;ity to provide Straw and Barley for two or three days. If you travel in <HI>May&punc;</HI> when the Gra&s;s is high, it co&s;ts nothing to &s;eed the Hor&s;es and Camels For as
<PB N="7" REF="13">
&s;oon as the <HI>Caravan</HI> is lodg'd, the Servants go and cut the Gra&s;s from off the Hil|locks, where it is much better then upon the Plains. But while the Bea&s;ts feed only upon Gra&s;s they are much weaker, and cannot travel &s;o far as at other times.</P>
<P>From the Mountain where the <HI>Armenians</HI> were &s;et upon, you come to <HI>Almous,</HI> a little Village upon a River, which you cro&s;s, over a Bridge of Wood.</P>
<P>Going out of <HI>Almous,</HI> you cro&s;s a large Plain, at the end whereof you lodge upon the Bank of a fair River, call'd <HI>Toufanlou-&s;ou,</HI> which falls into the River of <HI>Tocat.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd this River, you a&s;cend a high Mountain, which the People of the Country call <HI>Kara&punc;behir&punc;beguiendren,</HI> or, the Mountain that &s;tops the Grand <HI>Signors;</HI> for it is very rugged, and you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity alight to a&s;cend it. In that bad Way two Hor&s;es that carry'd each of them two Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth bur&s;t under their Burthen, which prov'd excellent Food for &s;everal <HI>Tartars</HI> that were before us, and were pitch'd in the place where we intended to have lodg'd our &s;elves; &s;o that we were forc'd to go a quarter of a League farther. The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> when they heard of our two dead Hor&s;es, made immediately to the Mountain fifteen or &s;ixteen of them with all joy imaginable to devour it. They flea'd the Hor&s;es, and when they came back (for I &s;tay'd to &s;ee them) they brought every one a great piece of Fle&s;h between the Saddle and their Hor&s;es backs. For by that means the Fle&s;h mortifies, and bakes as it were, through the motion and heat of the Hor&s;e, and &s;o they eat it without any more a-do. I &s;aw one of them that took a piece of tho&s;e Hor&s;es Fle&s;h, and after he had beaten it &s;oundly between two na&s;ty Linnen Clothes, with a piece of Stick, &s;et his Teeth in it, and devour'd it with a very greedy ap|petite.</P>
<P>Upon the top of the Mountain which I have mention'd, there is a Plain, and in the mid&s;t of the Plain a Fountain call'd <HI>Che&s;m&eacute;-beler,</HI> or, <HI>A Fountain of Chri&s;tal;</HI> near to which, on the South-&s;ide, there &s;tands a Village.</P>
<P>From the place where we lodg'd, we came to a little Town called <HI>Adras,</HI> the In|habitants whereof are all <HI>Armenians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A&s;pidar</HI> is but two Leagues from <HI>Adras,</HI> and is but a Village.</P>
<P><HI>Isbeder</HI> is another Village in the Mountains, where the <HI>Caravan</HI> generally &s;tays one or two days; as well to pay the Cu&s;tom, which is the fourth part of a Rixdollar upon every Camel, and half as much for every Hor&s;e; as for the excellency and cheap|ne&s;s of the Wine, where every Man provides for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Twice we pa&s;s'd by and paid nothing, in regard that the <HI>Caravan</HI> was too &s;trong for the Toll-gatherers; and were it not that they &s;tay for the Wine, they might go directly forward without paying any thing.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Isbeder,</HI> we came to another great Town in the Mountains; all the Hou&s;es are hewn out of the Rock upon which it is &s;eated, as are al&s;o all the Stair-Ca&s;es. From this Village, having pa&s;s'd a River, over a wooden Bridge, at the end &punc;whereof there &s;tands an Inn, you come to <HI>Zacapa,</HI> another Village, from whence through very narrow pa&s;&s;ages, where you are forc'd to unload the Camels, and carry your Goods upon Mens &s;houlders for thirty Paces together, you come to encamp in a little Plain. It lyes at the foot of a high Mountain, which they call <HI>Dikmebell,</HI> beyond which lies the Town <HI>Kourd Aga,</HI> after which you cro&s;s three Rivers; one fordable, the other over two Bridges, and then you come to a Village call'd <HI>Garmeru.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Garmeru</HI> you go to <HI>Seukmen,</HI> another Village; from <HI>Seukmen</HI> to <HI>Louri;</HI> from <HI>Louri</HI> to <HI>Chaouqueu,</HI> which are two very hand&s;om Towns.</P>
<P>I &s;aw an Old man at <HI>Chaouqueu</HI> who was above a Hundred and Thirty Years old, who when <HI>Sultan Amurath</HI> be&s;ieged <HI>Bagdat,</HI> gave his whole Army as much Oats as &s;erv'd them one whole day. In recompence whereof, the <HI>Sultan</HI> exempted him and his Children from all Taxes and Tolls for their Lives.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Chaouqueu,</HI> you come to a high craggy Mountain which is call'd <HI>Aaggi|dogii,</HI> or, <HI>The Bitter Mountain.</HI> The Ways being narrow, the <HI>Caravan</HI> is forc'd to travel &s;ingle; and then it is that they count all the Hor&s;es, and all the Camels; every Hor&s;e and every Camel paying to the <HI>Caravan</HI>-Ma&s;ter a certain Duty, which amounts to a good Sum if the <HI>Caravan</HI> be numerous. One part of that Money is to pay &s;even or eight <HI>Armenians,</HI> that guard the <HI>Caravan</HI> all the way; another part
 
<PB N="8" REF="14">
defrays the Expences upon the Road; and the remainder is the Captain of the <HI>Ca|ravan</HI>'s Profit.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd this Mountain, you come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to lodge in a Plain which they call <HI>Gio|gandere&s;i,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Erzerom</HI> you meet only with three Villages by the way, <HI>Achikala, Ginnis,</HI> and <HI>Higia,</HI> which are the <HI>Caravan</HI>'s Stages. During the&s;e three la&s;t days&punc; journeys, you keep all along the Banks of <HI>Euphrates</HI> for the mo&s;t part, which is yet but narrow, taking its &s;ource Northward of <HI>Erzerom.</HI> 'Tis a wonderful thing to &s;ee the va&s;t quantities of large <HI>A&s;paragus</HI> that grow all along the River, with which you may load &s;everal Camels.</P>
<P>A League on this &s;ide <HI>Erzerom</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> is con&s;train'd to &s;top; For the Officer of the Cu&s;tom&punc;Hou&s;e accompani'd with the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant, comes here and tyes all the Bales and Che&s;ts with a cro&s;s Cord, upon which he puts a Seal, to the end that when the Merchants come to the Town, they may not be able to take out any Bags of Money, or any pieces of Stuff on purpo&s;e to hide them till they go away. The particular Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant in meeting the <HI>Caravan,</HI> is to &s;ee whether the Merchants be well provided with Wines. And if he de&s;ire any Bottles, whether it be then, or in the City, where they are not a&s;ham'd to vi&s;it every Merchant, there is no refu&s;ing them. For there grows no Wine at <HI>Erzerom,</HI> all that is drank there being a &s;mall Wine of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> which is always green: which forces the Merchants to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Wine at <HI>Tocat,</HI> which they may do &s;ufficiently to la&s;t them into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e generally allows the <HI>Caravan</HI> three days to re&s;t; during which time, he &s;ends to the principal Merchants &s;ome Fruit and other &s;mall Refre&s;hments, by which he is no lo&s;er. After the three days are over, he comes and opens all the Bales and Che&s;ts, and takes a particular account of all the Merchandizes. This Search and the changing of Bea&s;ts, cau&s;es the <HI>Caravan</HI> to &s;tay generally twenty or five and twenty days at <HI>Erzerom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Erzerom</HI> is a frontier Town of <HI>Turkie</HI> toward <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> It is &s;ituated at the end of a large Plain environ'd with Mountains, the Plain being beautified with many fair Villages. If you take in the Ca&s;tle and the Suburbs, it may pa&s;s for a City, but the Hou&s;es are ill built of Wood, without any neatne&s;s or proportion. There are &s;ome Remains of Churches and of the ancient Buildings of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> by which you may conjecture that it never was very beautiful. The Fortre&s;s &s;tands upon a high ground, with a double Wall, &s;quare Towers clo&s;e one to another, and a pitiful Moat. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> re&s;ides there but in a very ill Hou&s;e, all the Buildings about the Fortre&s;s being in a bad condition. In the &s;ame Enclo&s;ure there is a little ri&s;ing Ground upon which they have rais'd a &s;mall Fort, wherein the <HI>Jani&s;ary-Aga</HI> lives, and where the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> has no Power. When the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> has a mind to the Head of this <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> or any other con&s;iderable Per&s;on in the Province, he &s;ends a <HI>Capigi,</HI> with order to the <HI>Jani&s;ary</HI> to &s;end for the Per&s;on to the little Fort, where the Execution is pre&s;ently done. One Example hereof I &s;aw in my la&s;t Travels into <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> For the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Erzerom</HI> not having &s;ent Twelve thou&s;and men &s;o &s;oon as the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> requir'd them for his Wars in <HI>Candy,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Capigi</HI> that brought the Sentence of his Death, had the &s;ame Order for the Exe|cution of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Kars;</HI> and meeting this <HI>Capigi</HI> upon the Road in a Village, upon his return for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he would needs &s;hew me whether I would or no, the Heads of the two <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s, which he was carrying to the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> in a Bag.</P>
<P>Between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Gate of the Fortre&s;s are to be &s;een four and twenty Pieces of Cannon, mo&s;t excellent Guns, but lying one upon another without Car|riages. They lye at <HI>Erzerom</HI> to be ready upon all occa&s;ions when the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> makes war again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>There are in <HI>Erzerom</HI> &s;everal great Inns; this City, like <HI>Tocat,</HI> being one of the greate&s;t Thoroughfares in <HI>Turkie.</HI> The Country about it bears Wine, but not very good, and in regard the People are &s;trictly forbid to drink Wine, the Merchants are forc'd to buy it very privately, for fear it &s;hould come to the know|ledge of the <HI>Cadi.</HI> Though it be very cold at <HI>Erzerom,</HI> Barly grows there in fourty days, and Wheat in &s;ixty, which is very remarkable. The Cu&s;toms paid there for the carrying out of the Gold and Silver, and upon all other Commodities, is very &s;evere. Silk, that comes out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> pays four and twenty Crowns for a
<PB N="9" REF="14">
Camel's Load, which is eight hundred Pounds. For in the mountainous Coun|tries a Camel's Load is no more; but in the plain and even Countries they make 'em carry above ten hundred weight. A Load of <HI>Indian</HI> Calicuts pays a hundred Crowns; but the Loads of Linnen are much heavier than tho&s;e of Silk. As for other Commodities, they pay Six <HI>per cent</HI> according to their value.</P>
<P>From this Stage the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;ets forward to a Fortre&s;s call'd <HI>Ha&s;&s;an Kala,</HI> where you mu&s;t pay half a Pia&s;ter for every Camel's or Hor&s;es Load going from <HI>Erzerom</HI> to <HI>Erivan,</HI> but returning you, pay but half as much.</P>
<P>Leaving this Fortre&s;s, you mu&s;t go and lodge at a Bridge near to a Village which is call'd <HI>Coban-Cupri.</HI> Over this Bridge, which is the faire&s;t in the whole Journey, you cro&s;s two Rivers which there meet, one is the <HI>Kars,</HI> and the other is a Stream that falls from a Mountain call'd <HI>Binguiel,</HI> both which disburthen them&s;elves into the <HI>Aras.</HI> The <HI>Caravan</HI> u&s;ually &s;tays a day or two at this Bridge; becau&s;e the <HI>Cara|van</HI> divides it &s;elf at this place, &s;ome continuing on the High-road, others taking the Road of <HI>Kars,</HI> as well to avoid fording the <HI>Aras</HI> &s;everal times, as the paying a great Duty upon the great Road, where they exact four Pia&s;ters upon every Camel's Load, and two upon every Hor&s;e-Load, whereas at <HI>Kars</HI> you are di&s;|mi&s;s'd for half &s;o much.</P>
<P>I went <HI>Kars</HI> Road twice; but it is longer, and more trouble&s;ome than the other. As &s;oon as you leave the Bridge, for the fir&s;t four days you travel over woody Mountains, and very de&s;ert Countries, where you meet but with one Village; but coming near <HI>Kars</HI> the Country is more plea&s;ant, and well manur'd; bearing all &s;orts of Grain.</P>
<P><HI>Kars</HI> is in 78 Deg. 40 Min. of Longitude, and 42 Deg. 40 Min. of Latitude; in a very good Soil. The City is very large, but thinly peopl'd, though Provi&s;ion be very plentiful and very cheap. But the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> always choo&s;ing that place to rendezvouz his Army, whenever he intended to recruit it, and to lodge his People there which he &s;ent to build Villages; the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> has ruin'd all the Country, as he did at <HI>Sulfa,</HI> and in many other Frontier places, for nine or ten days journey together.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kars</HI> to <HI>Erivan</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> makes it nine days journey, and lyes where it can find mo&s;t convenience, there being no certain Stages. The fir&s;t days journey ends at a Mona&s;tery and a Village, the one no le&s;s de&s;erted than the other. The next day you come to the Ruines of a great City, call'd <HI>Anikagae,</HI> in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language the <HI>City of</HI> Ani, which was the name of an <HI>Armenian King</HI> that was the Founder of it. By the Wall, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, runs a rap&icirc;d &s;tream that falls from the Mountains of <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> and empties it &s;elf into the River of <HI>Kars.</HI> This City was very &s;trongly &s;ituated; being placed in a Mer&s;h, where are to be &s;een the Remains of two Cau&s;eys that only lead to the Town. There are the Ruines of &s;everal Mona&s;teries; among the re&s;t two that are entire, &s;uppos'd to be Royal Foundations. From thence to <HI>Erivan</HI> for two days jourhey, you meet with only two Villages; near the la&s;t of which you ride by the &s;ide of a Hill, whether when the <HI>Caravan</HI> pa&s;&s;es by, the people bring Hor&s;es from &s;everal parts to be &s;old. The Great Road from the Bridge, where the <HI>Caravan</HI> parts, lyes thus:</P>
<P>Two Leagues from the Bridge, on the right hand toward the South, lyes a great Mountain which the People of the Country call <HI>Mingol.</HI> In this Mountain there are abundance of Springs, and from one &s;ide of it falls <HI>Euphrates,</HI> from the other &s;ide the River of <HI>Kars,</HI> which empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Aras</HI> fourteen or fifteen Leagues on this &s;ide <HI>Erivan.</HI> The <HI>Aras,</HI> which the Ancients call'd <HI>Araxes,</HI> falls from other Mountains Ea&s;tward of <HI>Mingol,</HI> which after many windings through the Upper <HI>Armenia,</HI> where it receives many other Rivers that &s;well its Streams, it di&s;charges it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, two days journey from <HI>Shamaki,</HI> upon the Frontiers of the ancient <HI>Medes.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country is inter-cut by the Rivers <HI>Aras</HI> and <HI>Kars,</HI> and &s;everal other Streams that fall into them, inhabited by very few, but what are Chri&s;tians; tho&s;e few <HI>Mahumetans</HI> that live among them being &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that they will not drink the Water of any of tho&s;e Rivers, nor wa&s;h in them&punc; believing them impure and defil'd by the u&s;e which the Chri&s;tians make of them. They have their particular Wells and Ci&s;terns by them&s;elves, which they will not &s;uffer a Chri&s;tian to come near.</P>

<HI>Coma&s;our</HI> is the fir&s;t Village where you lodge after you leave the Bridge of <HI>Choban-Kupri,</HI> going to <HI>Erivan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Halicarcara</HI> is the next Stage to <HI>Coma&s;our:</HI> this is a great Town al&s;o inhabited by Chri&s;tians, but the Hou&s;es are built all under-ground like Caves. Coming thither the 7<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1655, the Snow was &s;o deep that there was no travelling, &s;o that we were forc'd to &s;tay there eight days. But the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Erzerom</HI> under|&s;tanding in what a bad condition we were, came in per&s;on with five hundred Hor&s;e to make way for us, and &s;ent for the Country people round about to clear away the Snow. But it was not &s;o much out of kindne&s;s to us, as for his own Intere&s;t. For a new Officer being to &s;ucceed him upon the 22^d o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>March,</HI> and our <HI>Caravan</HI> being very numerous, he would have lo&s;t above an Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns, had we not come to <HI>Erzerom</HI> before that day. Many of the Pa&s;&s;engers were almo&s;t blinded by continually looking upon the Snow, the colour whereof very much dims the Sight: for pre&s;ervation whereof the Travellers are wont to wear black Cypre&s;s Hoods, made on purpo&s;e, over their faces. Others wear furr'd Bonnets fring'd about with Goats hair, which being long, falls over their Eyes, and does altogether as well as the Hood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravan</HI> is u&s;ually twelve days upon the Road, from <HI>Erzerom</HI> to <HI>Erivan.</HI> Leaving <HI>Halicarcara,</HI> you ford the <HI>Aras</HI> three times, and cro&s;s it the next day again: for it winds exceedingly. A League and a half from the place where you ford it the fourth time, upon the top of a high Mountain &s;tands a Fortre&s;s call'd <HI>Kagui&s;gan,</HI> which is the la&s;t place which the <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s on that &s;ide. The Cu|&s;tomers that live there come to the <HI>Caravan</HI> to take their Toll, which is four Pia&s;ters for every Camel loaden, and two for every Hor&s;e loaden. In the year 1655 the <HI>Caravan</HI> lodging about a League from the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Kagui&s;gan,</HI> the Mountains adjoyning being inhabited by Chri&s;tian <HI>Armenians,</HI> there came to us a poor Bi&s;hop attended by fifteen or &s;ixteen per&s;ons, among which there were certain Prie&s;ts who brought us Bread, Fowl, and Fruit, de&s;iring the Charity of the Merchants, who recompenc'd them to their &s;atisfaction. About four or five Months after, this Bi&s;hop had one of his Eyes &s;truck out by a <HI>Jani&s;ary.</HI> That wicked Fellow came to the Town where the Bi&s;hop liv'd, and lighting upon the Bi&s;hop, ask'd him for Money, which becau&s;e the Bi&s;hop had none to give him, in a rage he &s;tabb'd him in the Eye with his Dagger. Complaint was made to the <HI>Aga,</HI> who 'tis thought would have puni&s;h'd the Offender, but he fled, and le&s;t the Bi&s;hop without remedy of &s;ati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>From the la&s;t place where we encamp'd near the <HI>Aras,</HI> we went and lodg'd the next day upon the &s;ame River, in the &s;ight of a Village not above a quarter of a League. The Next day we cro&s;s'd the River that runs from <HI>Kars,</HI> and parts <HI>Turkie</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The next day we &s;top'd upon the Banks of <HI>Aras,</HI> half a League from a little Town; and this is the la&s;t time you &s;ee this River which you are con&s;train'd to pa&s;s &s;o often.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Aras,</HI> we came to lodge in a plain, in &s;ight of a Town which is not far di&s;tant. The next day the <HI>Caravan</HI> lyes in the Field, and the next day it comes to a place where there are three Churches, whence it is but half a days journey from <HI>Erivan.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t Place worthy ob&s;ervation, entring into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> through <HI>Armenia,</HI> is that which they call the <HI>Three Churches,</HI> three Leagues from <HI>Erivan;</HI> which <HI>Three Churches,</HI> are three Mona&s;teries di&s;tant one from the other.

Nunnery for Virgins. The <HI>Armenians</HI> call this place <HI>Egm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;in,</HI> or the <HI>only Daughter,</HI> which is the Name of the chief Church. You may find in their Chronicles, That it began to be Built about three hundred Years after Chri&s;t, and that the Walls being rais'd to a good height, the Devil came in the Night and pull'd down what they built up in the Day; which he did for &s;everal Years: but that one Night Chri&s;t him&s;elf appear'd, and that from that time the Devil &s;urceas'd to mole&s;t them any more; &s;o that they fini&s;h'd the Church. It is dedicated to St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> whom the <HI>Armenians</HI> have in very great veneration. And there is a Table of Stone, whereupon, according to their Chronicles, Chri&s;t re&s;ted when he appear'd to St. <HI>Gregory.</HI> They that go into the Church, ki&s;s this Stone with a very &s;olemn Devotion.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is built in honour of a Prince&s;s that came with forty Virgins of Qua|lity to vi&s;it St. <HI>Gregory.</HI> This Lady an <HI>Armenian</HI> King caus'd to be thrown into a Well full of Serpents? but &s;he receiv'd no harm. For &s;he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d&punc; therein 14 Years by a great Miracle, and from that time to this, the Serpents that breed thereabouts never did any harm. That idolatrous King had a de&s;ign to have enjoy'd that Prince&s;s, who was very hand&s;ome, and all her Companions; but they overcame him by their Virtue: who thereupon, &s;eeing he could not have his Will, put them all to Death.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of all the <HI>Armenians,</HI> as well tho&s;e that come out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as tho&s;e that travel into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is to perform their Devotions at the&s;e <HI>Three Churches;</HI> and the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;tops u&s;ually five or &s;ix days, during which time they Confe&s;s, and receive Ab&s;olution from the Patriarch.</P>
<P>The Patriarch has under him forty &s;even Archbi&s;hops, and every Archbi&s;hop has under him four or five Suffragans, with whom he lives in a Convent, where there are &s;everal Monks under their Juri&s;diction. So &s;oon as they have &s;aid their Ma&s;s, which is generally done an Hour after Day, they all go to work, and to dig and delve for their living. The Revenue of the Patriarch is 600000 Crowns or there|abouts: for all the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians that are above fifteen Years of age, ought to pay him yearly five Sous. However there are many that do not pay him, by rea&s;on of their poverty. Yet their defect is &s;uppli'd by the rich, who &s;ometimes pay him two or three Crowns a Head. But this Money does not &s;tay in the Pa|triarch's Pocket: nay he is &s;ometimes behind-hand; for he is engag'd to relieve the poor <HI>Armenians,</HI> who have not wherewithal to pay the <HI>Carage,</HI> which is an Annual Tribute that they owe to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes, to whom they are &s;ubject: Other|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ity would force them to become <HI>Mahometans;</HI> and they, their Wives and Children would be liable to be &s;old, which the Grand Patriarch labours all he can to prevent. Every Archbi&s;hop &s;ends him out of his Dioce&s;s what is nece&s;&s;ary to be rais'd for that intent. So that the Patriarch does but only receive it with one Hand, and pay it with the other; making no profit to him&s;elf of a Revenue which he has out of 400000 Villages, which the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s affirm'd to me to be under his Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>As I return'd from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the Year 1655, I came to the <HI>Three Churches</HI> about the end of <HI>February;</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;tay'd there eleven Days, as well by rea&s;on of the great Snows that &s;top'd up the Ways, as for that the <HI>Armenians</HI> re&s;olv'd to keep their <HI>Carnival</HI> there, and after that to perform their Devotions. The next day I went to vi&s;it the Patriarch, who was &s;itting cro&s;s-leg'd upon a Mat. There were four Arch|bi&s;hops, and nine Bi&s;hops &s;itting about him in the &s;ame po&s;ture, among whom there was one that &s;pake very good <HI>Italian.</HI> I &s;tayed with him three Hours; and while we were di&s;cour&s;ing together, in came one of the Monks of the Covent, who had not &s;poken to any per&s;on what&s;oever in Two and twenty Years, by rea&s;on of a Penance that was impos'd upon him. Never did Man appear &s;o meager and de|formed; but the Patriarch &s;ent for him, and by his Authority commanded him to break &s;ilence, which he did, by &s;peaking at the &s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Saturday before <HI>Shrove-Sunday</HI> the Patriarch invited all the <HI>Caravan,</HI> as well Ma&s;ters as Servants, to hear Ma&s;s the next day, and then to dine at the Covent. Ma&s;s being concluded, the People were brought into a long Gallery, about 15 or 20 Foot broad, there being a Table on both &s;ides, made of &s;everal Stones, and Benches next the Walls. At the upper end of the Gallery &s;tands a Table four Foot &s;quare, over which is a vaulted Roof &s;u&s;tain'd with four Pillars, which &s;erves
<PB N="12" REF="16">
for a Canopy: in the mid&s;t whereof is a Chair &s;et for the Patriarch, who from thence has a full view of both &s;ides the Gallery; with two other Chairs of each hand, for two Archbi&s;hops: the other Archbi&s;hops, Monks, and Gue&s;ts &s;ate at the long Tables. The Meat which they brought us was &s;everal &s;orts of Pilaw, and &s;e|veral Di&s;hes of Fi&s;h, among the re&s;t excellent Trouts. The Pilaw was brought in forty wide Plates, &s;o well fill'd and &s;o large, that they were every one as much as a Man could carry. They were all &s;et down upon the Ground before the Patriarch; who then Pray'd and gave Thanks. Then &s;ix Bi&s;hops with Ladles took out the Meat out of the great Platters, and putting it into le&s;&s;er, &s;erv'd both the Tables. Every one had al&s;o his earthen Pot of Wine, which was very good, and was fill'd again when it was empty. The Patriarch and the two Archbi&s;hops eat nothing but two Eggs, and a few raw Herbs; no more did the other Archbi&s;hops that &s;ate at the Table.</P>
<P>At the end of the Fea&s;t, a Bi&s;hop comes with a Paper and Pen and Ink in his Hand, and asks of every one what he plea&s;es to Sub&s;cribe for the Benefit of the Church; then every one propo&s;ing, according to his Devotion, the Bi&s;hop writes down the Names of the Per&s;ons, and the Sum which they mention; which he comes and gathers the next day. There are &s;ome rich Merchants that will give two <HI>Tomans,</HI> but the meane&s;t Servant will give an <HI>Or.</HI> The Bi&s;hop having done writing, the Ta|ble was clear'd, and then they brought us Melons and other Fruits. In a &s;hort while after the Bells rung to Evening Service, and the People went to Church.</P>
<P>After Evening Service the Patriarch &s;ent for me to behold a Combat of <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s, of which there are great &s;tore in that Country, &s;ome &s;erving to Till their Ground, while the Female ones yield &s;tore of Milk, of which they make Butter and Chee&s;e, and which they mingle with all &s;orts of other Milk: There are &s;ome of the&s;e female Bea&s;ts that will give two and twenty Pints of Milk a day.</P>
<P>They brought us into a wide Enclo&s;ure, to behold the Sport, wherein there were eight <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s. To provoke them one again&s;t another, they &s;hew them a Red Cloth, which puts them into &s;uch a Rage, that there were two that dy'd with the &s;troke of their Horns upon the place, and there were none of the re&s;t which were not very much lam'd. The Sport being at an end, they bring a great quantity of Wood, which they pile together on purpo&s;e to &s;et it on Fire. When the Wood was heap'd in as big a Pile as they intended, one of the Archbi&s;hops pre&s;ented a Ta|per of white Wax to all the Company, both Ma&s;ters and Servants, who every one agreed with him what they &s;hould give the next day for their Tapers. The Tapers being lighted, the Patriarch with a Stick like a Bi&s;hop's Cro&s;ier, march'd before, &s;inging an Hymn, attended by all the Per&s;ons both Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Secular, till they had in that manner walk'd three times about the Pile. When the Pile came to be lighted, there was great &s;triving who &s;hould have the Honour. One of the Merchants offer'd a quantity of Oyl, for Lamps for the Church; another out-did him, and a third proffer'd more than he; and the Honour of Lighting the Pile was given to him that offer'd mo&s;t. Immediately upon that every one put out his Taper: For they e&s;teem it a mo&s;t precious bu&s;ine&s;s; believing that the lighting of one of tho&s;e Tapers in a Storm, and throwing it into the Sea, is a pre&s;ent Charm again&s;t Shipwrack. For &s;ay they, The Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> forty days after &s;he was brought to Bed, went to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and her Son; and going into the Temple met old <HI>Simeon,</HI> who taking the Child in his Arms, began to &s;ing the Song, <HI>Lord&punc; now let thy Servant,</HI> &amp;c. the Song being ended, all the People began to cry that Chri&s;t was born, and to publi&s;h it about the City. Now in regard it was Night, every one ran out with Torches in their Hands, and &s;ome made Fires before their Doors, where Chri&s;t was to pa&s;s along. This Fe&s;tival among the <HI>Armenians</HI> is like that of <HI>Candlemas</HI>-day; and they call it in their Language, <HI>Ter en Areche? Where is the Lord?</HI> The <HI>Armenians,</HI> Ma&s;ters and Servants, drank all Night to make an end of their <HI>Carnival:</HI> while the Patriarch was bu&s;ie in dre&s;&s;ing up the Church with its gaye&s;t Ornaments.</P>
<P>I could not believe there had been &s;o much Riches in the Chri&s;tian Churches under the Power of the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> It is not a hundred Years &s;ince this Patriarchal Church was in a much meaner Condition: But &s;ince the great <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> put the <HI>Armenians</HI> upon Traffick, they have very much enrich'd them&s;elves: For as they go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> great Gains; &s;o they made great Vows, and gave largely to the Church&punc;

wherein there are now as rich Ornaments as in any Church of Chri&s;tendom. The Choir of the Church was hung round with a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold. The Pavement al&s;o of the Choir and the Body of the Church, together with the Steps to the Altar, were &s;pread with rich Tape&s;try. For they all put off their Shooes before they go into the Church; nor do the <HI>Armenians</HI> kneel as in <HI>Europe,</HI> but &s;tand all the while upright. When they hear Ma&s;s, they &s;it after the Mode of the Country, but when the Le&s;&s;ons are reading they &s;tand up. All the Service-time their Heads are cover'd, unle&s;s at the Elevation of the Ho&s;t, for then they take off their Bonnets, and ki&s;s the Earth three times. There was upon the Altar a Cro&s;s, with &s;ix Candle&s;ticks of Gold; and upon the Steps to the Altar four Candle&s;ticks of Silver five foot high. After they had &s;ung &s;everal Hymns, the Patriarch &s;eated him&s;elf in a Chair cover'd with Silk Tape&s;try, four Archbi&s;hops &s;itting with their Backs to a Pillar at his right hand. The Service was &s;olemnly perform'd by an Archbi&s;hop, with two Bi&s;hops on each &s;ide of him. After the Archbi&s;hop had made certain Prayers, he took the Book wherein he had read the Go&s;pel and gave it the Patriarch, the Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and all the People to Ki&s;s. On the one &s;ide of the Cover of that Book there are two Relicks enchas'd, which are cover'd with Cry&s;tal, which was the &s;ide of the Book that was given to be Ki&s;s'd. The Ceremony being ended, many went to Ki&s;s the Patriarch's Hand, and &s;o retir'd.</P>
<P>Ten Leagues from <HI>Erivan,</HI> toward the North, appears a great Lake, wherein there is an I&s;land, upon which is built a very fair Covent. The Monks that live there, live &s;o au&s;tere a Life, that they never eat Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h above four times a Year: neither do they &s;peak one to another, but upon tho&s;e four Days. The re&s;t of the Year they feed only upon Herbs, which they gather out of the Garden: for &s;ay they, it is not Fa&s;ting, to eat either Butter or Oyl. The Bread which they eat is brought from the neighbouring Villages: and the I&s;land is repleni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of excellent Fruits.</P>
<P>On the one &s;ide of the Lake nearer to <HI>Erivan</HI> is a large Plain, wherein there are &s;ix Mona&s;teries. One of which is entirely hewn out of the Rock, with the Pillars that &s;u&s;tain it, being &s;eated in a very hard Rock. The <HI>Armenians</HI> call that Church <HI>Kickart</HI> in their Language, and the <HI>Turks</HI> in theirs <HI>Guicurghieche,</HI> that is, <HI>See and away.</HI> In this Church, according to the Traditions of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> is kept the Lance wherewith the Side of Chri&s;t was pierc'd; the Figure whereof I caus'd to be drawn upon the Place. The <HI>Armenians</HI> have this Lance in great Veneration, &s;aying, that it was brought thither by St. <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues from <HI>Erivan,</HI> towards the South-Ea&s;t, begins the Mountain <HI>Ararat;</HI> which will be always famous for being the re&s;ting-place of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark. Half a Leaugue from that Mountain, where the Plain begins to grow level, &s;tands a Church upon a little Hillock, clo&s;e by which are &s;everal Pits like Wells. They report that it was into one of the&s;e Wells that <HI>Cerda,</HI> an <HI>Armenian</HI> King, caus'd St. <HI>Gregory</HI> to be thrown, becau&s;e he would not Wor&s;hip his fal&s;e Gods. Between this Church and <HI>Erivan</HI> are to be &s;een the Ruines of the Ancient <HI>Artaxate,</HI> the Seat of the Kings of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which demon&s;trate that it has been a great City: be&s;ides, there appear the Ruines of a fair Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Erivan</HI> lies in 64 Degrees, 20 Minutes of Longitude; 41 Degrees, 15 Mi|nutes of Latitude; in a mo&s;t plentiful Country of all things nece&s;&s;ary for Humane Life, but e&s;pecially abounding in good Wine. It is one of the be&s;t Provinces of all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and yields the King a very large Revenue, as well by rea&s;on of the goodne&s;s of the Soil, as for being the great Thoroughfare of the <HI>Caravans.</HI> The yearly Revenue of the Governour only, otherwi&s;e call'd the <HI>Kan of Erivan,</HI> amounts to above 20000 Tomans, which make 840000 Livres. This City ly|ing upon the Frontiers of both Empires, has been taken and retaken by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;everal times. By which means the old City being ruin'd, they have built a new one, 800 Paces on this &s;ide, upon a Rock, at the foot whereof, upon the We&s;t-&s;ide runs a rapid Stream: it is call'd by the Name of <HI>Sangui-Cija,</HI> and in many places it is deep and full of Rocks. You cro&s;s it, over a fair Bridge of three Arches, in which are built little Chambers, where the <HI>Kan</HI> retires in the heat of the day. It is full of Fi&s;h&punc; e&s;pecially Trouts, which neverthele&s;s are dear enough. This River comes from a Lake called <HI>Gigaguni;</HI> about 25 Leagues from <HI>Erivan,</HI> toward the
<PB N="14" REF="18">
North, and falls into the <HI>Aras,</HI> that runs not above three Leagues off to the South. Though this City be fortified to the We&s;t by the River, yet it is never the &s;tronger, by rea&s;on of the Hills on the other &s;ide which command it: and in regard it is built upon a rock, the Moats of the Fort are not above three or four Foot deep. In &s;ome places the City is &s;ecur'd with a double Wall with &s;everal Towers; but the Walls being only of Earth, as are mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es, the Rain does more mi&s;|chief, than the Cannon would do. That part of <HI>Erivan</HI> to the North-We&s;t, is a kind of Suburb, but far better inhabited then the City: for there live all the Mer|chants and Artificers, together with the Chri&s;tian <HI>Armenians,</HI> who have four Churches there, with a Mona&s;tery. And of late years they have built al&s;o a very fair Inn in the &s;ame Quarter. In the City there only lives the <HI>Kan,</HI> with the Military Officers and Souldiers; the <HI>Kan</HI>'s Lodgings lying upon the River. The Governour is a Per&s;on of great Power, and has always &s;ufficient Forces about him to guard the Frontiers. The Summer being very hot at <HI>Erivan,</HI> he lyes in Tents upon the Mountains during the Heat. When a <HI>Caravan</HI> arrives, he is forc'd to give the King advice thereof: and if any Amba&s;&s;ador come thither, he is bound to maintain him at his own expence, and to cau&s;e him to be conducted to the Territories of the next Governour, who is oblig'd to do the &s;ame. So that Amba&s;&s;adors are not bound to be at any Expenees in the Territories of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Four Leagues from the City are high Mountains, where the Natives that inhabit the hot and Sun&punc;burnt Countries toward <HI>Chaldea,</HI> come Twenty Thou&s;and together, to &s;eek out good Pa&s;turage for their Cattel&punc; and about the end of Autumn return again into their own Country. I cannot compare this Mountanious Tract, whether for its Valleys&punc; and Rivers, or for the nature of the Soil, to any Part that I have &s;een, better than to that proportion of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which is call'd the <HI>Country of Vanx:</HI> and there is a Tradition among the Natives, That certain people that inhabited between the <HI>Alpes</HI> and Mount <HI>Jura,</HI> and which compos'd a Squadron of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Army, having &s;erv'd him in his Conque&s;ts, &s;eated them&s;elves in this part of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which they found &s;o like their own Country. From <HI>Tocat</HI> to <HI>Tauris</HI> the Inhabitants are for the mo&s;t part Chri&s;tians. Which large Tract of Ground being that which the Ancients call'd the Province of <HI>Armenia,</HI> 'tis no wonder to meet with fifty <HI>Arme|nians</HI> for one <HI>Mahometan.</HI> There are many ancient <HI>Armenian</HI> Families in <HI>Erivan,</HI> which is their native Country; but they are well us'd by the Governours, who being far di&s;tant from the Court, do what they plea&s;e. This City not being far remote from the Province from whence the Silks come, is the place where all the Buyers and Sellers re&s;ort. But neither in <HI>Erivan,</HI> nor in any other part of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are the Merchants put to open their Bales at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es, as in <HI>Turkie.</HI> They only pay certain Duties toward &s;ecuring the Highways; which Duties they call <HI>Rade|ries,</HI> and tho&s;e tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> gather them <HI>Raders.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kans</HI> or Governours of Provinces in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are civil to Strangers, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that they like, or that &s;hew them any thing of Curio&s;ity. The fir&s;t time that I went into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> I took a young Watchmaker with me, and coming to <HI>Erivan,</HI> I carried him to the <HI>Kan</HI> who was then Governour. It was at a time when Watches were very rare in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and the <HI>Kan,</HI> under&s;tanding what&punc; Trade the Young Man was of, told us he was the fir&s;t Watch-maker that ever had been in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> Thereupon he brought the young man a Watch to mend, and that he might have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him work, he lodg'd us in a Chamber next his own, and made us drink with him every day; for he was a true Toper, and com|pell'd us to drink with him from four in the Afternoon 'till near Midnight, in a place which he had made on purpo&s;e, in his Garden, to take off his Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This was he, that having deliver'd <HI>Erivan</HI> to <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> went along with him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and became his Favourite for teaching him to Drink. <HI>Amurat</HI> left a Garri&s;on of 22000 Men in the City; but <HI>Sha-Shefi</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King begirt it pre&s;ently with a &s;trong Army; and planting him &s;ecurely under one of the Hills that command the City, he batter'd it ince&s;&s;antly with eight Pieces of Cannon: the fourth day he made a Breach, and though he had the repute of a Coward, he was the fir&s;t at the A&s;&s;ault, and took the City: and becau&s;e they would not yield at his Summons, he put all the Garri&s;on to the Sword. For which <HI>Amurat,</HI> was quit with <HI>Sha-Shefi</HI> afterwards, though not in &s;o noble a way; for entering a Victor into <HI>Bagdat,</HI> he put all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to the Sword, after he had given them his word to the contrary, and promis'd to &s;pare their lives.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the &s;ame Road from <HI>Erivan</HI> to <HI>Tauris.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT u&s;ually takes up ten days journey for the <HI>Caravan</HI> to go between <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris;</HI> and <HI>Nak&s;ivan</HI> is almo&s;t in the mid-way between both. The fir&s;t days journey you travel through large Plains &s;ow'd with Rice, and water'd with &s;everal Rivulets. The next day you contiue to Travel through Plains of the &s;ame nature, in &s;ight of the Mountain <HI>Ararat,</HI> which is full of Mona|&s;teries, leaving it upon the South. The <HI>Armenians</HI> call this Mountain <HI>Me&s;e&s;oufar, The Mountain of the Ark;</HI> becau&s;e the Ark of <HI>Noah</HI> re&s;ted upon it. It is as it were unfa&s;ten'd from the other Mountains of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and from the half-way to the top, it is continually cover'd with Snow. It is higher than any of the neighbouring Mountains; and in my fir&s;t Travells I &s;aw it for five days Journey together. So &s;oon as the <HI>Armenians</HI> di&s;cover it, they ki&s;s the Earth, and lifting up their eyes to Heaven, &s;ay their Prayers. Yet you are to take notice, that the Mountain is hid in Clouds for two or three Months together: In the plains that you cro&s;s in this &s;econd days journey, to the Southward a League and a half from the High|way, is to be &s;een a work of great Art; being the Ruines of a Magnificent Ca&s;tle, where the Kings of <HI>Armenia</HI> were wont to re&s;ide in the time of their Hunting Diverti&s;ements; more e&s;pecially when they continu'd their &s;ports at the Mallard and Heron. The next day we lodg'd near to a Village where there was good Water, which con&s;train'd the <HI>Caravan</HI> to &s;tay there; there being none to be met with for ten Leagues farther. The next day you mu&s;t Travel one by one through the Pa&s;s of a Mountain, and cro&s;s a large River nam'd <HI>Arpa&s;on,</HI> which falls into <HI>Aras.</HI> It is fordable when it is low, but when the Snow melts and &s;wells the &s;tream, you mu&s;t go a League out of your way to the Southward to cro&s;s it, over a Bridge of Stone. From thence you go to lodge near a Village call'd <HI>Kalifakiend,</HI> where you are forc'd to fetch you Water a good way off. The fir&s;t days journey is through a Plain, at the end whereof you meet with an Inn, call'd <HI>Kara-bagler,</HI> &s;tanding upon a Rivulet; which was fini&s;h'd in 1664. The Head of this Rivulet &s;prings three or four Leagues higher toward the North; and half a League below <HI>Kara-Bagler,</HI> the Water congeals and petrifies; and of tho&s;e Stones is the Inn built. The Stone is very &s;light; and when they have need of it, they make Trenches all along the Stream, and fill them with the &s;ame Water, which in eight or ten Months turns into Stone. The Water is very &s;weet, and has no bad ta&s;t; yet the Country-men thereabouts will neither drink it, no water their Grounds with it. The <HI>Arme|nians</HI> &s;ay, that <HI>Sem</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah</HI> caus'd the Rock to be hollow'd, out of which this River i&s;&s;ues; which four or five Leagues from its Head, and two from the Inn, falls into <HI>Aras.</HI> From this Inn to <HI>Naksivan</HI> is but a &s;mall Journey. <HI>Naksivan,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="20">
according to the Opinion of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> is the mo&s;t ancient City of the World&punc; built about three Leagues from the Mountain upon which the Ark of <HI>Noah</HI> re&s;ted: from whence it al&s;o takes its Name; for <HI>Nak</HI> in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies a <HI>Ship,</HI> and <HI>Sivan, re&s;ting</HI> or <HI>repo&s;ing.</HI> 'Twas a great City, now wholly ruin'd by the Army of <HI>Sultan Amurath.</HI> There are the Remains of &s;everal rare Mo&s;quees, which the <HI>Turks</HI> have de&s;troy'd; for the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> de&s;troy one anothers Mo&s;quees as fa&s;t as they fall into one anothers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This City is very ancient, and the <HI>Armenians</HI> report, that it was in this place where <HI>Noah</HI> went to live, when he went out of the Ark. They &s;ay further, that he was Buried here; and that his Wife has a Tomb at <HI>Marante</HI> upon the Road to <HI>Tauris.</HI> There runs a little River by <HI>Naksivan,</HI> the Water whereof is very good; the Spring whereof is not far di&s;tant from the Head of the River of <HI>Karabagler.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> drove a great Trade in Silk formerly in this Town, which is now very much abated: however, there is a <HI>Kan</HI> which has the Command there. All the Country between <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris</HI> was wholly de&s;troy'd by <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the fir&s;t of that Name; to the end that the Armies of the <HI>Turks,</HI> not meeting with any &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, might peri&s;h of them&s;elves. To this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent all the Inhabitants of <HI>Zulfa</HI> and the Parts adjoyning into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> Old and Young, Fathers, Mothers, and Chil|dren, with which he planted new Colonies in &s;everal parts of his Kingdome. He &s;ent above 27000 Families of <HI>Armenians</HI> into <HI>Guilan,</HI> whence the Silks come; and where the har&s;hne&s;s of the Climate kill'd abundance of tho&s;e poor people, that were accu&s;tom'd to a milder Air. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable were &s;ent to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where the King put them upon the Trade of Silk, and lent them Commodities, for which they paid upon the return of their Markets, which &s;uddenly &s;et the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> upon their Feet again. The&s;e are they that Built the City of <HI>Zulfa,</HI> which is only &s;eparated from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> by the River of <HI>Senderou,</HI> calling it <HI>New Zulfa,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the old City, which was the Habitation of their Ance&s;tors. A third part of the people were di&s;pers'd into other Villages between <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and <HI>Sciras.</HI> But the old People dying, the young ones generally turn <HI>Mahumetans:</HI> &s;o that now you can hardly meet with two Chri&s;tian <HI>Armenians</HI> in all tho&s;e fair Plains, which their Fathers were &s;ent to manure.</P>
<P>Among the Ruines of <HI>Naksivan</HI> appear the Ruines of a great Mo&s;quee, which was one of the mo&s;t &s;tately Buildings in the World: which &s;ome &s;ay was built in memory of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ah</HI>'s Burying-place. As you depart out of the City, near to the River that runs by it, appears a Tower, which is an excellent piece of Architecture: It is compos'd of four <HI>Duomo</HI>'s joyn'd together, which &s;upport a kind of a Pyramid, that &s;eems to be fram'd of twelve little Towers; but toward the middle it changes its figure, and le&s;&s;ening like a Spire, ends in a Point. The Building is all of Brick, but as well the out-&s;ide as the in-&s;ide is over-&s;pread with a kind of Varni&s;h of Parget, wrought into Flowers, like Embo&s;s'd work. 'Tis thought to have been an Edifice, &s;et up by <HI>Temur-leng</HI> when he had Conquer'd <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Naksivan</HI> and <HI>Zulfa,</HI> on each &s;ide, as well to the North as to the South, there are ten Covents of Chri&s;tian <HI>Armenians,</HI> di&s;tant about two or three Leagues one from the other. They acknowledge the Pope, and are govern'd by certain Religious <HI>Dominicans</HI> of their own Nation. And to keep up their Religion, they &s;end from time to time to <HI>Rome</HI> certain Children born in the Country, to learn the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues, and other nece&s;&s;ary Sciences. It is thought there are in this Quarter above &s;ix thou&s;and Souls that ab&s;olutely follow the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> only that they &s;ing the <HI>Office</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Tongue, that all the People may hear and under&s;tand them. The Archbi&s;hop, being cho&s;en, is &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> to be confirm'd. He re&s;ides at a great Town, which is one of the mo&s;t lovely places in all <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> the Wine and Fruits that grow there are very delicate, be&s;ides the abundance of all other things nece&s;&s;ary for Humane Life. Every Covent &s;tands near a great Village: the chiefe&s;t where I have been twice, is <HI>Aba|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ener,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Abraghonnex,</HI> the third <HI>Kerna,</HI> the fourth <HI>Soletak,</HI> the fifth <HI>Kouchkachen,</HI> the &s;ixth <HI>Giaouk,</HI> the &s;eventh <HI>Chiabonnez,</HI> the eighth <HI>Araghouche,</HI> the ninth <HI>Kauzuk,</HI> the tenth <HI>Ki&s;ouk,</HI> which lyes upon the Frontiers of <HI>Curdi&s;tan</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;yria:</HI> Here it is, that the <HI>Armenians</HI> believe St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew</HI> to have been Martyr'd, of which they pretend to &s;hew &s;ome Relicks at this day, Many <HI>Mahometans</HI> came thither out of Devotion, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are troubl'd
<PB N="17" REF="20">
with Feavers. There are two or three of tho&s;e Convents, where they civilly entertain &s;uch Chri&s;tians as come out of <HI>Europe;</HI> though the Monks there are very poor. They al&s;o live very au&s;tere lives, feeding upon nothing but Herbs. That which makes them &s;o poor, is the often change of Tyrannical Governours, whom they are oblig'd to pre&s;ent with large Gifts But in regard they cannot give much, tho&s;e Governours have no kindne&s;s for them; for which rea&s;on, being in&s;tigated by tho&s;e other <HI>Armenians</HI> who are able to oblige them, they u&s;e them &s;o &s;everely, that they are often forc'd to complain to the King; which I have many times &s;een done at <HI>Ispahan.</HI></P>
<P>A League and a half from the chief of the&s;e Covents there is a high Mountain, &s;eparated from all the re&s;t, which ri&s;es like a Sugar loaf, as doth the Pike of a <HI>Tena|riff.</HI> At the foot of this Mountain are certain Springs, that have the virtue to heal tho&s;e that are bit by Serpents; in &s;o much that Serpents carry'd to that place will dye immediately.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caravan</HI> is ready to &s;et out from <HI>Naksivan</HI> for <HI>Zulpha,</HI> which is not above a days journey from thence, the principal <HI>Armenians</HI> u&s;ually go out of the way to the Covent of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> which lyes to the South.</P>
<P>Now the Road from <HI>Naksivan</HI> to St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s lyes fir&s;t to a great Village call'd <HI>Eccli&s;ia,</HI> where live the riche&s;t <HI>Armenians,</HI> that drive a great Trade in Silk, and have built them a very fair Church.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Eccle&s;ia</HI> you mu&s;t cro&s;s the River <HI>Aras</HI> in a Ferry-Boat, being as it were fqueez'd between two Mountains in that place: Once I went over upon the Ice. About two Musket &s;hot from thence, you mu&s;t cro&s;s over a Bridge, another River that &s;alls into the <HI>Aras.</HI> From the foot of the Bridge you begin to a&s;cend a little Hill, at the top whereof you meet with a great Village, call'd <HI>Shamb&eacute;,</HI> all the Inhabitants whereof, as well Men as Women, grow Mad at 18 years of age; but it is &s;uch a madne&s;s that it is not mi&s;chievous. Some believe it to be the Puni&s;hment of Heaven, for that their Forefathers in the&s;e Mountains per&s;ecuted St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Stephen</HI>'s it is not above a League, but the Way is very trouble|&s;om. St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s is a Convent built not above 30 years ago. It &s;tands upon the Mountains, in a barren place, and of difficult acce&s;s. But the rea&s;on why the <HI>Armenians</HI> cho&s;e that place before any other, is becau&s;e that St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew</HI> retir'd thither in the time of their Per&s;ecution. They add, that St. <HI>Matthew</HI> did a Miracle in that place; for that there being no Water there before, he only &s;truck his &s;tick upon the Ground, and pre&s;ently there aro&s;e a Spring. This Spring is about half a quarter of a League from the Convent, under a Vault with a good Door to it, to keep the Water from being wa&s;ted. The <HI>Armenians</HI> go to vi&s;it this Spring in great Devotion, having laid the Water into the Covent with Pipes. They al&s;o &s;ay, that in this place they found &s;everal Relicks which St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew</HI> le&s;t there, to which they add a great many others; among the re&s;t a Cro&s;s, made of the Ba&s;in wherein Chri&s;t wa&s;h'd his Di&s;ciples Feet: In the middle of the Cro&s;s is a white Stone, which as they report, if you lay upon a Sick per&s;on, will turn black if the per&s;on be likely to dye; and recover its former whitene&s;s after the death of the party.</P>

<P>A little Box, wherein they keep a great number of pieces of Bones, which they believe to be the Relicks of the Seventy Two Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>The Church is built in the form of a Cro&s;s, as are all the Churches of the <HI>Arme|nians;</HI> in the middle whereof ri&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fa r <HI>Duomo,</HI> round about which &s;tand the twelve Apo&s;tles. Both the Church and Covent are of Free &s;tone, and though the whole Edifice be not very big, there has been abundance of Gold and Silver wa&s;ted upon the Walls: Many <HI>Armenian</HI> Families have been very much endamag'd thereby; for the Women were &s;o devout, that unknown to their Husbands they &s;old their Jewels, and their very Cloaths to defray the Expences of Building.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time that I was at St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s, in the company of &s;ome <HI>Armenians,</HI> two Bi&s;hops, attended by &s;everal other Monks, came out to meet us, and led us
<PB N="18" REF="21">
into a great Hall, where we were very well treated. For it is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> a little before Meals to pre&s;ent their Gue&s;ts a large Cup of Aqua-Vitae, with Sweet-meats of all &s;orts, be&s;ides Citron and Orange-peels candy'd, in &s;even or eight Porcelan-di&s;hes, laid in a great <HI>China</HI> Ba&s;in. This is a little Prelude to excite the Appetite; for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> both men and Women, will empty great Cups of Aqua-Vitae. After Dinner they go to Church, where they &s;ing certain Hymns: when you return, there are a &s;ufficient number of Mattre&s;&s;es or Quilts to lye upon; for they u&s;e no other &s;ort of Beds over all <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> only at Night you &s;pread a Carpet upon a Quilt, and &s;hut the Door. We &s;aw not the Archbi&s;hop all that Evening, only at Church.</P>
<P>About Midnight all the Bells rang, and every body ro&s;e to go to Church. I belieye it was more than u&s;ual, becau&s;e it was <HI>Shrovetide;</HI> for both the <HI>Office</HI> and the <HI>Mi&s;&s;a</HI> were both concluded by break of day. Between eight and nine in the Morning the Cloth was laid; before which time we &s;aw abundance of the Neigh|bouring Country people, who brought Wine, Fruits, and other Provi&s;ions, and pre&s;ented all to the Archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>While we were at Breakfa&s;t news came that a certain Bi&s;hop was dead, in his return to the <HI>Three Churches;</HI> whither he was &s;ent by the Patriarch to gather certain Duties due from the Villages. Immediately the Archbi&s;hop ri&s;ing from the Table with all his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and having made a Prayer for the Dead, &s;ent a Bi&s;hop and &s;ix Monks to fetch the Corps; who returning a little after Midnight, the Body was pre&s;ently laid in the Church upon a Carpet &s;pread upon the Ground, with the Face turn'd toward the Altar. In the mean time, a great number of Wax-candles were lighted, and all the re&s;t of the Night two monks watch'd by turns to Pray for the Dead. Early in the Morning the Archbi&s;hops, the Bi&s;hops, and all in Religious Orders, &s;aid the <HI>Office for the Dead,</HI> which la&s;ted half an Hour; and at the end of the Ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> they brought the Corps to the Altar, &s;o that they made the Feet of the Corps to touch it. Having &s;o done, they took off the Linnen Cloth that cover'd his Head, at which time the Archbi&s;hop anointed him in &s;ix places with the Holy Oyl, &s;aying certain Prayers every time. Then they cover'd him again, and &s;aid other Prayers which la&s;ted half an Hour. The&s;e Ceremonies perform'd, they carry'd the Corps out of the Church with Cro&s;&s;es and Banners, and every one a Taper in his Hand. As the Corps pa&s;s'd by, one of the Bi&s;hops put a Paper in his right hand, containing the&s;e words, <HI>I came from the Father, and I return to the Father.</HI> Being brought to the Grave, upon a little Mountain near the Covent, and &s;et down, they &s;aid other Prayers which la&s;ted a quarter of an hour. In the mean time a Bi&s;hop going down into the Grave, took away all the Stones and made the place &s;mooth, after&punc; which the Corps was let down wrapt in a large Linnen Sheet. Then the Bi&s;hop, according to ther cu&s;tom, rais'd his Head a little higher than his Body, turning his face to the Ea&s;t. Which being done, the Archbi&s;hop and A&s;&s;i&s;tants took every one a handful of Earth, which the Archbi&s;hop ble&s;t, and giving it to the Bi&s;hop, he &s;trew'd it over the Body. Then the Bi&s;hop coming out again, the Grave was fill'd up.</P>
<P>From St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s there is a de&s;cent for a League together to <HI>Aras,</HI> by the &s;ide whereof you are to keep along till you come to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> where you come into the high Road again. There is another way quite over the Mountain, which is the nearer way by a League, but 'tis very trouble&s;om and toyl&s;om, and therefore the le&s;s frequented.</P>
<P>But to return to the High Road from <HI>Naksivan;</HI> half a League from <HI>Naksivan</HI> you meet with a River which falls into <HI>Aras,</HI> which is to be cro&s;s'd over a Stone-Bridge of 12 Arches, though there be but little Water, unle&s;s it be when the Snow melts, or the Rains fall. In a Meacow, next the Bridge, where we lodg'd one time that I travell'd that way, there is a Spring of luke warm Water, which will loo&s;en the Belles of them that drink it. At this Bridge it is that the Toll-gatherer comes and takes his Duties, when the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;tays not at <HI>Naksivan.</HI> You mu&s;t pay ten <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's</HI> for every Camel's Loading, or nine Livers, which is for the &s;e|curing the Highways. The&s;e Duties are demanded in many places of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with|out &s;earching the Packs. The Governours al&s;o in their Provinces are made to an&s;wer for every Robbery committed: which makes it &s;o &s;afe travelling in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that you need not keep with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> unle&s;s you will your &s;elf.</P>

From this Bridge to <HI>Zulfa</HI> is but one days journey; which Town being altogether ruin'd, &s;hews the rea&s;on wherefore the <HI>Caravan</HI> lodges upon the Bank of the River five hundred Paces on this &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Zulfa,</HI> the ancient Habitation of the <HI>Armenians</HI> which <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> carried into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is a Town &s;queez'd between two Mountains, through which the <HI>Aras</HI> runs, leaving but little Land on either &s;ide. It carries no Boats till about two Leagues below, (for upward it will hardly bear a piece of Timber) and in regard the Country grows low and extends it &s;elf into Plains, there is no fear of Rocks, the cour&s;e of the Stream being very quiet. There was a fair Stone-Bridge, which <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> caus'd to be broken down, when he wholly de&s;troy'd the Town, that it might be no harbour for the <HI>Turks.</HI> Neither by the Ruines, nor by its Situation, doth it appear to have been a City of any ancient Beauty; the Stones were clapt unskilfully together without Morter, &s;o that the Hou&s;es were more like Caves than Hou&s;es. The North-We&s;t &s;ide was mo&s;t inhabited, there being nothing on the other &s;ide worth taking notice of. The Lands about <HI>Zulfa</HI> being very fertil, there are certain <HI>Armenian</HI> Families return'd, who live very quietly. <HI>Cogia Nazar,</HI> one of the chief <HI>Armenians</HI> that went out of <HI>Zulfa,</HI> growing rich by Trade, and being in great reputation with <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> and <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, who made him <HI>Kelonter,</HI> or Chief Judge of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Nation, built two great Inns, for the Honour of his Country, in <HI>Zulfa,</HI> upon each &s;ide of the River one. He &s;pent above an hundred thou&s;and Crowns, but dying left two remarkable Pieces of Work unfini&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Half a League on this &s;ide <HI>Zulfa,</HI> before you cro&s;s a Torrent that falls into <HI>Aras,</HI> you may take your choice of two ways to go to <HI>Tauris.</HI> The one upon the right hand, leading to the South Ea&s;t, which is the ordinary Road; the other upon the left hand, toward the North Ea&s;t, which we took eight or ten in company together on hor&s;eback, the la&s;t time I went to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> We left the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that takes the great Road, and never goes the other way, becau&s;e it is full of Rocks and Stones that &s;poil the hoofs of the Camels. However I was willing to &s;ee a new Country, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe before I come to the great Road.</P>
<P>From the Torrent where we left the <HI>Caravan,</HI> we went forward, and lay at a Village not above a League and a half off.</P>
<P>The next day, after we had kept along by the Banks of the <HI>Aras</HI> for five or &s;ix Hours, we came to <HI>A&s;tabat,</HI> which lyes a League from the River, where we &s;taid above two Days to divert our &s;elves. This is but a little City, but a very neat one; where there are four Inns, and every Hou&s;e has its Fountain. The great plenty of Water makes the City very fruitful in all things; more e&s;pecially in good Wine. This is the only Country in the World that produces the <HI>Ronas,</HI> for which there is a va&s;t utterance all over <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI> The <HI>Ronas</HI> is a Root that grows in the Earth like Liquorice, and is not much bigger. The u&s;e of it is to dye Red, and this is that Red which gives that beautiful tincture to all the Calicuts that come out of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country. Though the Roots which are pull'd out of the Earth are very long, yet they cut them into pieces not above as long as a Man's Hand, for the better accommodation of Carriage. It is a wonderful thing to behold at <HI>Ormus</HI> whole <HI>Caravans</HI> laden with this <HI>Ronas,</HI> which they Ship off from thence to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Root is full of Juyce, and yields a very high Tincture; for I remember that an <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that was laden with it, being ca&s;t away in the Road of <HI>Ormus,</HI> where the Bags of <HI>Ron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> floated, the Sea look'd of a red colour for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>A&s;tabat,</HI> it behov'd us to provide our &s;elves with Straw and Barley for our Hor&s;es, under&s;tanding that we &s;hould meet with none all that days journey. From thence we travell'd upon a de&s;cent for an hour together to the River <HI>Aras,</HI> which we cro&s;s'd in a Boat; and all the re&s;t of the day we travel'd through Mountains, over Torrents and Stones. That Evening we lay upon the Bank of a &s;mall Stream.</P>
<P>The day following, after we had travel'd through a &s;pacious Valley for two or three hours, we a&s;cended a high Mountain, at the top whereof we met with two or three pitiful Hou&s;es, where we &s;topt that day.</P>
<P>The next, which was the fifth after, we left the <HI>Caravan,</HI> we travel'd upon a
 
<PB N="20" REF="22">
de&s;cent for two or three hours, till we came to a great Village neatly &s;ituated, where there grows excellent Fruit. There we repos'd for an hour or two; and from thence we came to a great Stone-Bridg on a River where there is no Water but when the Rains fall. It falls into the Lake <HI>Roumi,</HI> but the Water of the River is &s;o &s;owr and ill ta&s;ted, e&s;pecially when it is low, that it is not to be drunk. About a quarter of a League from the Bridge are three long Stones &s;et in the Ground like Pillars: the Natives &s;ay that they were placed there for a Monument, in the &s;ame place where <HI>Darius</HI> the Son of <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> was elected King by the cunning of the Gentleman of his Hor&s;e: from whence to <HI>Tauris</HI> is but half a League. The Moun|tains of the <HI>Medes</HI> which we cro&s;s'd in this Road, and tho&s;e which run along toward the ancient <HI>Parthians,</HI> are the mo&s;t fertil in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> They bear Corn and Fruit in abundance; for upon the high Mountains there are fair Plains &s;ow'd with Wheat, which are extraordinary fertil. The Springs which ri&s;e there, and Rains which fall give a fre&s;her beauty and a higher ta&s;t to what grows there, more than in any other part of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> that wants Water; and the products of tho&s;e Fields are of a higher price.</P>
<P>Now for the great Road. The <HI>Caravan</HI> having cro&s;s'd the Stream where we left it, lodges the next Night upon the Banks of <HI>Aras,</HI> over which it ferries the next Mor|ning. It does not go thorough <HI>Zulfa,</HI> though it be &s;o near it; becau&s;e that on the other &s;ide of the City, there are three Leagues of Way very bad and unfre|quented. For which rea&s;on you mu&s;t leave <HI>Zulfa</HI> on the right hand, which is not much out of the way. After two hours travel you go by a Bridge which is call'd <HI>Sugiac;</HI> after which you come upon Heaths encompa&s;s'd with high Rocks. All this days journey you meet with no Water, but only one little Fountain, and the Water is &s;o bad that the Bea&s;ts will hardly drink it.</P>
<P>The day following you travel through an even Country, but very barren: where you meet with nothing but a forlorn Inn; though it be a place where Co&s;t has been be&s;tow'd, and built all of Free-&s;tone, that was fetch'd a great way off. The next Stage is <HI>Marante,</HI> famous for the Burying-place of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Wife. The Town is not very big; re&s;embling rather a Thicket than a City: but the &s;ituation is very plea&s;ant, in the middle of a fertil Plain adorn'd with &s;everal well peopl'd Villages. This Plain does not extend above a League round about <HI>Marante,</HI> the Country beyond it being all barren. However it is not altogether unprofitable: for being a continual Heath, it affords feeding for the Camels, which are there bred for the <HI>Caravans.</HI> Which is the rea&s;on that there are &s;o many Camel-Ma&s;ters at <HI>Sugiac</HI> and <HI>Marante,</HI> who furni&s;h great part of the Road. At <HI>Marante</HI> you mu&s;t pay thirteen <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's,</HI> or four Crowns for every Camel's Load, for the &s;ecurity of the Road.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Marante,</HI> you lodge the next night a League from <HI>Sophiana</HI> in a bu&s;hy Plain, where the Water is worth nothing; after you have travell'd a mix'd Country, barren enough, where you meet with but one Inn in a Valley: but it is a very fair one. <HI>Sophiana</HI> is an indifferent large City, which you cannot &s;ee till you come within it, by rea&s;on of the great number of Trees planted in the Streets and round about it, which makes it look rather like a Fore&s;t than a City.</P>
<P>The next day, which is u&s;ually the tenth days journey from <HI>Erivan,</HI> the <HI>Caravan,</HI> having cro&s;s'd fair, large and fertil Plains, arrives at <HI>Tauris.</HI> Tho&s;e Plains are water'd with &s;everal Streams that fall from the <HI>Median</HI> Mountains; but the Water is not all of the &s;ame goodne&s;s, for there is &s;ome which cannot be drunk.</P>
<P>In the mid-way between <HI>Sophiana</HI> and <HI>Tauris,</HI> lyes a Hill, from whence you have a pro&s;pect over tho&s;e Plains, upon which the Army of <HI>Sultan Amurath</HI> Encamp'd, when he be&s;ieg'd <HI>Tauris.</HI> The news coming to <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that he had burnt it, and was marching further into the Country with a hundred thou&s;and Men, <HI>Let him come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>without any di&s;turbance, I know how to make the</HI> Turks <HI>pay for their Inva&s;ion without any great trouble.</HI> They were then not above fifteen days march from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> when <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> turn'd the cour&s;e of all the Streams both before and hehind, which only run from certain Springs, and are brought in Cutts or Chanels into the Inland-parts of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where there are no Rivers: By which means the whole Army of the <HI>Turks</HI> peri&s;h'd for want of Water in tho&s;e va&s;t un|water'd Countries where they had engag'd them&s;elves too far.</P>
<P><HI>Tauris</HI> lyes in 83 Degrees, 30 Minutes of Longitude; and 40 Degrees, 15 Mi|nutes of Latitude, in an open place where there is not a Tree to be &s;een; and
 
<PB N="21" REF="22">
environ'd with Mountains on every &s;ide, but only upon the We&s;t. The further<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mountain is not above a League from the City; but there is one which almo&s;t touches it, being only &s;eparated from it by the River. 'Tis a good Country, and fruitful in Corn; there is good Pa&s;turage, and great &s;tore of Pul&s;e. Some think that <HI>Tauris</HI> was the ancient <HI>Ecba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ane,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Empire of the <HI>Medes.</HI> It is at this day a great City and well peopl'd, as being the Mart for <HI>Turkie, Mu&s;covy,</HI> the <HI>Indies,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> There are an infinite number of Merchants, and va&s;t quantities of all &s;orts&punc; of Merchandize: particularly of Silk, which is brought out of the Province of <HI>Guilan,</HI> and other places. There is al&s;o a great Trade for Hor&s;es, which are hand&s;om and cheap. Wine, Aqua-vitae, and indeed all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions are cheap enough; and Money trolls about in that place more than in any other part of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Many <HI>Armenian</HI> Families have got great E&s;tates there by Trade, and under&s;tand it better than the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> A little River, the Water whereof is very good, runs through the middle of <HI>Tauris;</HI> it's call'd <HI>Schein|ka&iuml;e,</HI> over which there are three Bridges to cro&s;s from one part of the City to the other.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of the Buildings in <HI>Tauris</HI> are of Bricks bak'd in the Sun; the Hou&s;es not being above one or two Stories high at mo&s;t. The tops of the Hou&s;es are terra&s;s'd; the Roofs within are vaulted, and plai&s;ter'd with Earth mix'd with chopt Straw, which they whiten afterwards with Lime. In the year 1638 the City was almo&s;t ruin'd by <HI>Sultan Amurath;</HI> but it is almo&s;t all rebuilt again. There are in it <HI>Bazars,</HI> or Market-hou&s;es, which are well built, and many Inns very commodious, two Srories high. The faire&s;t is that of <HI>Mirza-Sad&eacute;</HI> Governour of the Province, who caus'd it to be built with a Market-hou&s;e adjoyning, to which he has added a Mo&s;quee and a Colledge, with good Revenues.</P>
<P>The great Trade of <HI>Tauris</HI> renders it renown'd over all <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> for it has a con|tinual Traf&s;ick with <HI>Turks, Arabians, Georgians, Mengrelians, Per&s;ians, Indians, Mu&s;covites,</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> The <HI>Bazars</HI> or Market-hou&s;es, which are cover'd, are always full of Goods: for there are &s;ome which are peculiar to the Handicraft-Trades; the mo&s;t part whereof are Smiths, &s;uch as make Saws, Axes, Files, and Steels to &s;trike Fire, with Tobacco-&s;toppers belonging to them. Some there are that make Pad-locks: for the Ea&s;tern People fa&s;ten their Doors only with wooden Bolts. There are al&s;o Turners, that furni&s;h the neighbouring Parts with Spinning-Wheels and Cradles: and &s;ome Gold&s;miths, that make trifles of Silver. But there is abundance of Silk-weavers that are Arti&s;ts, and work very neatly; and indeed there are more of tho&s;e than of any other Trade. Here it is that they dre&s;s the greate&s;t part of the Shagrin-Skins that are vended &s;o plentifully all over <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for there are none unle&s;s it be the Country-people, but wear Boots or Shooes of Shagrin-Leather. This Leather is made either of the Hides of Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, or Mules&punc; and only of the hinder part of the Hide: but the A&s;&s;es Hide has the be&s;t grain.</P>
<P>There are to be &s;een at <HI>Tauris,</HI> Ruines of the &s;tately Edifices round about the great <HI>Piazza,</HI> and the neighbouring parts: they have al&s;o let run to ruine four or five Mo&s;quees of a prodigious height and bigne&s;s. The mo&s;t magnificent and the bigge&s;t &s;tands as you go out of the Town, in the Road to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> will not come near it, but look upon it as defil'd, and a Mo&s;quee of He|reticks, in regard it was built by the <HI>Sounnis,</HI> or the followers of <HI>Omar.</HI> 'Tis a va&s;t Structure fairly built, the Front whereof is fifty Paces broad, with an a&s;cent of eight Steps. It is lin'd without with Brick-work varni&s;h'd with different Co|lours; and adorn'd within with very fair Painting <HI>A l'antique,</HI> and abundance of Cifers and <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters in Gold and Azure. Upon two &s;ides of the Fore-front are rear'd two <HI>Minarets</HI> or Towers very high, but not very wide, yet with Stairs to go up to the top. They are lin'd with varni&s;h'd Brick-work, which is the u&s;ual Ornament of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Buildings: and at the top &s;tand two <HI>Cupola's,</HI> form'd like the Turbants which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> wear. The Gate of the Mo&s;quee is not above four Foot wide, cut out of a great tran&s;parent white Stone, four and twenty Foot high, and twelve broad. Entring at the Door of the Mo&s;quee, you come into a &s;pacious <HI>Duomo,</HI> thirty &s;ix Paces in Diameter, rais'd upon twelve Pillars within, and &s;up|ported by &s;ixteen without, which Pillars are very high, and &s;ix Foot &s;quare. Below there is a Balu&s;trade or Rails that run round about the Building, with Doors to go
<PB N="22" REF="23">
from one &s;ide to the other: and the Foot of every Pillar, which is of white Marble, is hollow'd into little Niches equal with the Floor, where the People put their Shooes, when they go farther to their Devotions. The in&s;ide of the Walls is varni&s;h'd in Squares of &s;everal Colours, with Flowers, Cifers, and <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters intermix'd, and wrought in Embo&s;s'd work, &s;o well painted, &s;o well gilded that it &s;eems to be but one piece of Work, cut out with a pair of Sci&s;&s;ars. From this Duomo you pa&s;s to another le&s;&s;er, but more beautiful in its kind. The lower pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t is of tran&s;parent white Stone, of the &s;ame nature with that in the Front, cut in great Panes like a Door that never opens. This Duomo has no Pillars, but eight Foot high, it is all of white Marble, where are to be &s;een Stones of a prodigious length and bredth: The in&s;ide of the Vault is a violet Enamel, painted with all &s;orts of Flowers in Flat-work, but the out&s;ide of both the Duomo's is cover'd with varni&s;h'd Brick-work, and Flowers embo&s;s'd <HI>A la More&s;que.</HI> Upon the fir&s;t the Flowers are black upon green; upon the &s;econd, white Stars upon black: which diver&s;ity of Colours is very plea&s;ing to the Eye.</P>
<P>Near the Door out of which you enter into the le&s;&s;er Duomo, on the left hand, &s;tands a Chair of Walnut-tree curiou&s;ly-carv'd, and fa&s;ten'd to the Wall; it &s;tands upon a Platform rais'd &s;ix &s;teps high, without any Canopy. On the right hand &s;tands another Chair of the &s;ame Wood, and an exqui&s;ite piece of Workman&s;hip; with a kind of State over it of the &s;ame Wood, fa&s;ten'd to the Wall. There is a little Rail about it; and the Platform is four &s;teps high. On the South-&s;ide of the Mo&s;quee there are two white tran&s;parent Stones, which when the Sun &s;hines upon them look red: And &s;ometimes after the Sun is &s;et, you may read at tho&s;e Stones by the reflection of the Sun-beams.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t again&s;t the Mo&s;quee on the other &s;ide is another Front, which is the only Remain of a ruin'd Building. It was the abode of the <HI>Sheck Iman,</HI> or the Chief Prie&s;t. There had been large Baths which belonged to it, but they are all de&s;troy'd; &s;ome others there were of le&s;s note, which are not lookt a&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the great Piazza of <HI>Tauris</HI> and in the parts adjoyning, &s;tands a &s;air Mo&s;quee, a Colledge, and a Ca&s;tle, which fall to decay; the&s;e Buildings being for&s;aken; by rea&s;on they were made u&s;e of by the <HI>Sounni's,</HI> which were followers of <HI>Omar.</HI> Near the &s;ame Church is a ruin'd Church of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> whither they &s;ay St. <HI>Helena</HI> &s;ent the true Cro&s;s. There is another Mo&s;quee, which was formerly a Church dedicated to St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t, where they &s;ay one of his Hands was pre|&s;erv'd a long time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capuchins</HI> have a very convenient Hou&s;e at <HI>Tauris;</HI> for <HI>Mirza-Ibrahim</HI> Go|vernour of the Province, who&s;e credit is equal to the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Tauris,</HI> which is the chiefe&s;t Command in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> favours him very much with his protection. This Governour has made him&s;elf very con&s;iderable at Court&punc; and very much re&s;pected by the King for his indefatigable pains, and his extraordinary agility in augmenting the King's Revenue: having found out &s;uch ways for that purpo&s;e, as never entred into the thoughts of any that preceded him in the the &s;ame Employment. He is very curious to learn all the Noble Sciences, which is a quality very rare among the <HI>Per|&s;ians:</HI> He al&s;o takes great delight in the Mathematicks and Philo&s;ophy, di&s;cour&s;ing often with <HI>Gabriel de Chinon,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> Covent in <HI>Tauris.</HI> But the great de&s;ire which <HI>Mirza-Ibrahim</HI> had, to have his two Sons taught by the &s;aid <HI>Gabriel,</HI> was the chief motive that made him &s;o &s;avourable to that Covent. He bought the Friers a place to build their Hou&s;e, and liberally furni&s;h'd them for the Expence of the Work.</P>
<P>When the Sun &s;ets and ri&s;es, there are a certain Company of People, who are oblig'd to make a hideous noi&s;e with Drums and Trumpets in the <HI>Meidan,</HI> or great Piazza of the City. They &s;tand upon one &s;ide of the Piazza in a Gallery &s;omewhat rais'd, which is a Cu&s;tom ob&s;erv'd in all the Cities under the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Government.</P>
<P>As you go out of <HI>Tauris</HI> upon the North-&s;ide, there is a Mountain clo&s;e by, there being only the River between it. The name of it is <HI>Einali-Zeinali,</HI> and for|merly there &s;tood upon the top of it a fair Hermitage of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> which the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have converted into a Mo&s;quee. At the bottom of the Mountain &s;tands a Fortre&s;s and a Mo&s;quee, which they let go to ruine, becau&s;e they were built by the <HI>Ottomans.</HI> A little farther upon the brink of the Precipice &s;tands a Mona|&s;tery, near to which are two Caves, where are certain Sepulchers and Marble Pillars
<PB N="23" REF="23">
lying along up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Ground. There are al&s;o in the Mo&s;quee certain Tombs of the ancient Kings of the <HI>Medes,</HI> the Remains whereof &s;hew that the Work was very Excellent.</P>
<P>Upon the Road from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> about half a League from the utmo&s;t Gardens, between &s;everal knaps of the Mountain which you leave upon the right hand, upon the top of the highe&s;t of all, where there never was any Water, and where it is impo&s;&s;ible to bring any, appears a Bridge Fifty paces long, the Arches whereof are very fair ones, but it falls to decay. It was a <HI>Mollah</HI> that built it, out of what de&s;ign no per&s;on new: nor can you come to <HI>Tauris</HI> upon that &s;ide, but you mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;ee that Bridge, becau&s;e there is no other way, there being nothing but Water and Precipices on either hand. Afterwards he confe&s;s'd that he built it out of meer Vanity, knowing that <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the fir&s;t of that name, was to come to <HI>Tauris.</HI> The King indeed came &s;ome time after, and &s;eeing an unprofitable Bridge upon the top of a Mountain, he demanded who built it, and what was his de&s;ign. To whom the <HI>Mollah</HI> return'd this an&s;wer, Sir, &s;aid he, I built that Bridge, that when your Maje&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">me to <HI>Tauris,</HI> you might inform your &s;elf from the mouth of him that built it. By which it appear'd that the <HI>Mollah</HI> had no other ambition than to oblige the King to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>A League from <HI>Tauris</HI> to the We&s;t, in the middle of a field, &s;tands a great Brick Tower, call'd <HI>Kanhazun.</HI> It is about fifty Paces in Diameter, and though it be half ruin'd, yet it is very high. It &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ms to have been the Dungeon of &s;ome Ca&s;tle, there being very high Walls round about it; which though they be but of Earth, neverthele&s;s appear to be very ancient. It is not certainly known who built this Tower, but the <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters upon the Gate afford us &s;ome rea&s;on to conclude that it was a <HI>Mahometan</HI> &s;tructure. In the year 1651 there happen'd a terrible Earthquake in <HI>Tauris</HI> and the parts thereabouts, by which many hou&s;es were over|turn'd, and this Tower then cleaving from the top to the bottom, a good part of it fell down, and fill'd up the hollow within-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the little River that runs by <HI>Tauris,</HI> there is another bigger to be cro&s;s'd about half a League from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ity, over which there is a very fair Stone-Bridge: Near to it &s;tands a Sepulcher, cover'd with a little <HI>Duomo,</HI> where the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;ay that the Si&s;ter of <HI>Iman Riza</HI> lyes interr'd; and they have it in great veneration. The River that runs under the Bridge comes from the Mountains of the North, and falls into the Lake <HI>Roumi,</HI> thirteen or fourteen Leagues from <HI>Tauris.</HI> They call it <HI>Aggi|&s;ou,</HI> or <HI>Bitter&punc;water;</HI> for the Water is very bad, and without any Fi&s;h. The Lake which is fifteen Leagues in compa&s;s, has the &s;ame quality, the Water being blacki&s;h: the Fi&s;h that happen into it out of other Rivers that fall into it, pre&s;ently become blind, and in a &s;hort while are found dead by the Shoar. This Lake takes its name from a Province and a little City, which are both call'd <HI>Roumi,</HI> being not above Eleven Leagues from <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of the Lake, upon the way that leads to a little City call'd <HI>Toko|riam,</HI> there is a little Hill that ri&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly, the a&s;cent whereof is very &s;mooth, and out of it there ri&s;e many little Springs. The farther they run from the Head, the wider grow the Streams. And the Earth which they water is of two di&s;tinct qualities; the fir&s;t Earth that is digg'd &s;erves to make Lime: the next to that is a hollow &s;pungy Stone, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> is good for nothing: but under that again is a white tran&s;parent Stone, which you may &s;ee through as through Gla&s;s, which being &s;mooth and poli&s;h'd &s;erves to adorn the Hou&s;es. This &s;tone is only a congelation of the Waters of the&s;e Streams; for &s;ometimes you &s;hall meet with creeping Animals congeal'd within. The Governour of the Province &s;ent one piece to <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> as a great pre&s;ent, wherein there was a Lizard congeal'd of a Foot long. He that pre|&s;ented&punc; it to the Governour had Twenty Tomans, or three hundred Crowns; after|wards I offer'd a thou&s;and for the &s;ame Piece.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan</HI> Road from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> through <HI>Ardevil</HI> and <HI>Casbin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Ispahan</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> makes it generally twenty-four days journey.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day you cro&s;s over dry Mountains, and four Leagues from <HI>Tauris</HI> you meet with one of the faire&s;t Inns in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This Inn <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> caus'd to be built; it is very convenient, and large enough to lodge a hundred per&s;ons with their Hor&s;es. Over all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> e&s;pecially from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Ormus,</HI> you meet every day with Inns at an equal di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The next day you de&s;cend a Mountain, in very rugged and narrow way. At the foot of this Mountain there are two ways for the Merchants to choo&s;e that will go to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> They that will go the ordinary road and the direct way through <HI>Kom</HI> and <HI>Kachan,</HI> leave a Lake upon the left hand that parts the two Roads; and they that will go through <HI>Ardevil</HI> and <HI>Casbin,</HI> two other good Cities, leave the Lake upon the right hand, and coa&s;t along by the &s;ide of the Mountain. From <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Ardevil</HI> it is not above a dozen Leagues; and having pa&s;s'd the Lake, the Country is very good: Which is the Road I intend to de&s;cribe fir&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ardevil</HI> being at &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance from <HI>Tauris,</HI> lyes almo&s;t in the &s;ame Degrees and Minutes of Longitude and Latitude. This City is famous, as well for being the fir&s;t Market of Silks that come from <HI>Guilan,</HI> from which it is not far off; as al&s;o for the Sepulcher of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> the fir&s;t of that name, King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The avenues to it are very plea&s;ant, being as it were Alleys of great Trees, which are call'd <HI>Tchinar,</HI> planted in a &s;treight line, at a due di&s;tance&punc; It is of a moderate bigne&s;s, and &s;eated in a lovely opening of the Mountains. The next to the Cities, which is call'd <HI>Sevalan,</HI> is the highe&s;t in all <HI>Media.</HI> The Hou&s;es of <HI>Ardevil</HI> are built of Earth, as are mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es in the City of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> but the Streets are very uneven, dirty, and narrow. There is but one which is hand&s;om, at the end whereof is built the <HI>Armenian</HI> Church. A little River runs through the middle of the City, which de&s;cending from the neighbouring Mountains runs from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. It is by Indu&s;try brought into many Cuts to water the Gardens, and in many places there are very fair Trees planted, which are very delightful to the Sight. The <HI>Meydan</HI> or Market-place is a very great one; more long than round; where &s;tands a very fine Inn, upon one &s;ide, which the <HI>Kan</HI> caus'd to be built. There are &s;everal others in &s;everal parts of the City, which have the Pro&s;pect over &s;everal lovely Gardens, e&s;pecially that which belongs to the King; to which you go through a long and &s;tately Walk of four rows of Trees, at the end whereof &s;tands a large Gate that gives you entrance. Though the Country about <HI>Ardevils</HI> be proper to bear Vines, yet there are none thereabouts; nor is there any Wine made till about four or five Leagues from the City. The <HI>Armenians</HI> that dwell in the City are very well &s;tor'd with it; though there be no place in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where there is &s;o much Caution to be us'd, either as to the Importing it, or the Drinking it; both which mu&s;t be done very privately: Which proceeds from the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Super&s;tition; the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> having &s;o peculiar a veneration for that place, that they believe it a &s;in to &s;uffer Wine to be publickly drank therein.</P>
<P>The people come in Pilgrimage from all parts of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Sepulcher of <HI>Sha-Sefi;</HI> which together with the va&s;t Trade of Silk, makes <HI>Ardevil</HI> one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities of all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> There are &s;everal other Buildings added to the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> wherein he lyes interr'd; the Entry whereof faces, the <HI>Meydan,</HI> to which it is joyn'd upon the South-&s;ide with a large Portal. The Gate is chain'd with Chains fa&s;ten'd a cro&s;s with great Rings; which if any Criminal Offender can but touch, and enter into the fir&s;t Court, he is &s;afe; for no per&s;on can apprehend him. This is a large Court, yet more in length than breadth, without the Wall whereof that looks upon the Market-place, &s;everal Shops are built for Merchants and Trade&s;men.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
Out of this Court you pa&s;s into another which is le&s;s, and pav'd with broad Stones, with a Rivulet running through the middle. The Entry into it is through a Door, fortifi'd with Iron Chains like the former&punc; and is made at a corner of the great Court upon the left hand. It brings you pre&s;ently under a <HI>Portico&punc;</HI> where there are fair Balconies rais'd after the fa&s;hion of the Country&punc; Tho&s;e Balconies are full of &s;everal People; either Pilgrims, or per&s;ons who&s;e Crimes con&s;train them thither for Sanctuary. In that place you mu&s;t leave your Stick and your Sword, before you go any farther; and give &s;omething be&s;ides to a <HI>Moullah,</HI> who is always attending there with Books.</P>
<P>In that &s;econd Court through which the Rivulet glides, on the one &s;ide are Baths, on the other Granaries for Rice and Corn; and upon the left hand, at the end of the &s;ame Court, there is a little Door which brings you to a place where the Royal Alms are di&s;tributed to the Poor, Morning and Evening; being ju&s;t again&s;t the King's Kitchin. This Gate is cover'd with Plates of Silver; and in the Kitchin there are about thirty Ovens contriv'd in the Wall, with as many great Caldrons to dre&s;s Pilaw and other Food, as well for the Poor as for the Officers of the <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> While the&s;e Alms are di&s;tributing, the Ma&s;ter-Cook, who commands all the re&s;t, &s;ets upon a Chair cover'd with Plates of Silver, and &s;ees that every thing be done in order. He &s;ees to the mea&s;uring out the Rice every day for the Kettles, and cau&s;es the Victuals to be divided in his own &s;ight: For there is an excellent Oeco|nomy in the King's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the end of the <HI>Portico</HI> beyond the fir&s;t Court there are two Gates, one beyond another, both cover'd with Plates of Silver, between tho&s;e two Gates on the right hand appears a little <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> where are the Tombs of &s;everal <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Princes of the Blood Royal. You mu&s;t have a great care not to tread upon the Thre&s;holds of the Gates; for it is a Crime not to be expiated without a &s;evere Puni&s;hment. From hence through a little Ile, you come into the Body of the Church, richly hung with Tape&s;try, and &s;et about with high Desks, where lye a great many Books, wherein the <HI>Moullahs,</HI> or Doctors of the Law read continually, having Stipends to Officiate in the <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> At the end of the Body of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> is a little Octagonal Monument, like the Choir of a Church, in the mid&s;t whereof &s;tands the Monument of <HI>Sha-Sefi.</HI> It is only of Wood, but curiou&s;ly carv'd and inlaid. It exceeds not the height of a Man of an ordinary &s;tature&punc; and &s;eems like a great Che&s;t, having four Apples of Gold &s;et up at each corner. It is cover'd with a Crim&s;on Satin purfl'd with Gold; and all the other Tombs that are by it, are cover'd with Silks as rich. As well in the Choir as in the Body of the Church, there are abun|dance of Lamps, &s;ome of Gold, &s;ome of Silver; but the bigge&s;t of all is of Silver; gilded and vermilion'd, and neatly engrav'd. There are al&s;o &s;ix great Branches of a curious &s;ort of Wood, cover'd with Silver, with great Wax Candles in them, which are never lighted but at their great Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Duomo</HI> where &s;tands the Tomb of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> you go under a little Vault, which enclo&s;es another Monument of another King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e Name I could not learn. It looks like another great Che&s;t, curiou&s;ly wrought, and cover'd with Satin. The Roof of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> is adorn'd within with a Painting of Gold and Azure, <HI>a la More&s;que;</HI> on the out-&s;ide, with a fair Varni&s;h of &s;everal Colours, like the &s;tately <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> at <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P>In the adjacent Parts round about <HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> are &s;everal Monuments worth a Man's &s;ight, being very ancient; and &s;ome which are ruin'd, &s;hew by what remains the care wich they took to enrich them with curious Workman&s;hip. A quarter of a League from the City &s;tands a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> in which are the Tombs of the Father and Mother of <HI>Sha-Sefi.</HI> It is a fair Structure, with Gardens and Courts, in one of which there is a very clear Fountain where they keep Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> is not only famous, as I have &s;aid already, for the Royal Sepulchers which are in it, and for the Pilgrimages which have been made to it from all parts of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but the numerous <HI>Caravans</HI> of Silk, which &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of eight or nine hun|dred Camels, add very much to its Grandeur. For being near to <HI>Guilan</HI> and <HI>Sha|maqui,</HI> from whence tho&s;e va&s;t quantities of Silk come; and for that the Road from both tho&s;e places, to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna,</HI> lyes through this City, there is a continual confluence of Merchants, and all &s;orts of Merchandizes are here to be had as well as at <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
From <HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> to <HI>Casbin</HI> you travel through a good Country; for every three of four Leagues you meet with little Rivers that fall from the Northern Mountains, and water the Earth. The <HI>Caravan</HI> is u&s;ually five days between <HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> and <HI>Arion,</HI> between <HI>Arion</HI> and <HI>Taron</HI> two, between <HI>Taron</HI> and <HI>Casbin</HI> two more. Half a League on this &s;ide <HI>Taron</HI> you mu&s;t cro&s;s a great River over a &s;tone Bridge, and half a League beyond you come to <HI>Kalkal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arion</HI> is a little City, <HI>Taron</HI> and <HI>Kalkal</HI> are two great Towns; and there are but the&s;e three places in all <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> where there grow any Olives, or that they make any Oyl. Leaving <HI>Kalkal,</HI> you travel over a Plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or three hours, at the end whereof is a Way which you you cannot get over in le&s;s than four hours. The way is &s;o bad that the Hor&s;es and Mules can hardly get up; but for the Camels, they mu&s;t take the lower Road, which is al&s;o very tedious, and full of Stones, which the Torrents tumble down, and it is three or four Leagues about. When you are up, the Country is level, and you have not above three Leagues to <HI>Casbin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Casbin</HI> lyes in 87 Degrees and 30 Minutes of Longitude, and 36 Degrees and 15 Minutes of Latitude. It is a great City, the Hou&s;es whereof are low and ill built; except &s;even or eight, which are next to the King's Gardens. It has no Walls, and indeed the be&s;t half of the City is in Gardens. There are three Inns, with Market-places round about; one of the three being large and commodious. It is inhabited altogether by <HI>Mahometans;</HI> or if there be any Chri&s;tians, they are very few.</P>
<P>The Soil about <HI>Casbin</HI> produces Pi&s;taches. The Tree that bears that is never bigger than a Walnut-tree of ten or twelve years old. The great quantity of Pi&s;ta|ches that are exported out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> come from <HI>Malavert,</HI> a little City twelve Leagues from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> toward the Ea&s;t. The&s;e are the be&s;t Pi&s;taches in the World, and the Country being of a large extent, produces them in &s;uch abundance, that it furni&s;hes all <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Casbin,</HI> you come to a little Village where there is but one Inn; and you travel that day &s;ix Leagues through Countries fertil enough, and well water'd.</P>
<P>The next day you travel through a good Country, and in nine or ten hours you come to <HI>Dengh&eacute;.</HI> This is a great Village at the foot of a Hill, through which there runs a fair River. It abounds with excellent both White and Claret Wine, where the Travellers take care to repleni&s;h their Bottles. But generally they never lye here; being de&s;irous to go a League farther, for a good Inn's &s;ake, which makes it a hand&s;om Stage.</P>
<P>At this Town of <HI>Dengh&eacute;</HI> it is where the two Roads from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> meet: the fir&s;t, through <HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> and <HI>Casbin,</HI> I have already de&s;crib'd. Hither al&s;o come the <HI>Caravans</HI> that go for the <HI>Indies</HI> through <HI>Me&s;h&eacute;head</HI> and <HI>Candahar,</HI> and where they leave <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> Road to take the left-hand Way, which carries them Ea&s;tward.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The ordinary Road from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> through <HI>Zangan, Sultanie,</HI> and other places.</HEAD>
<P>VVE mu&s;t now return again to the Lake &s;ix Leagues beyond <HI>Tauris,</HI> where they that will take the ordinary &s;hort way through <HI>Zan|gan</HI> and <HI>Sultanie,</HI> leave the left hand way of <HI>Arde&uuml;il</HI> and <HI>Casbin.</HI> This Lake is u&s;ually full of large red Ducks, which are very good Meat.</P>
<P>From thence, after twelve or thirteen hours travel, in which time you meet with three Inns, you come to <HI>Kara&s;hima,</HI> a large Town in a deep Valley, that &s;eems to be well manur'd. There is in it only a &s;mall Inn built of Earth, the Doors whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;o low, that the People are forc'd to creep upon their knees to get in.</P>
<P>The next day you come to another large Village call'd <HI>Turcoma,</HI> where the Soil is fertil, though it be very cold. There are &s;everal <HI>Caravan&s;era's</HI> built like a long
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Alley cover'd, which are only of Earth, the Men lying at one end, and the Hor&s;es at another.</P>
<P>The next day you travel over an uneven and de&s;ert Country, and in eight hours time you come to <HI>Miana,</HI> a little City &s;ituated in a Mar&s;h, where you pay a Toll for Guarding the Highways. In this City is one of the faire&s;t Inns in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Two hours after you leave <HI>Miana,</HI> you mu&s;t cro&s;s a River, over a fair Bridge which runs to decay; the Arches whereof are hollow within; it is built of Brick and Free-&s;tone, being near as long as <HI>Pont neuf</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> This Bridge &s;tands almo&s;t at the foot of a Mountain call'd <HI>Kaplenton. Sha-Abas</HI> caus'd all the way to be Pav'd, becau&s;e the Land is &s;o fat and &s;loughy, that when it thaws, or that the lea&s;t Rain falls, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Caravan</HI> to pa&s;s. Be&s;ides, there are a &s;ort of Camels in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that when it comes to rain in a deep Soil, are not able to keep their Legs: nay through the weight of the Burthens which they carry, their very Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ters will rive from their Shoulders, and their Bellies will bur&s;t. So that before the way was pav'd, they were forc'd to &s;pread Carpets in the mo&s;t &s;lippery ways where tho&s;e Camels were to pa&s;s: which mu&s;t be &s;till done in &s;ome places, where the Pavement is worn away.</P>
<P>At the lower part of the de&s;cent toward <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> upon the knap of a Hill which &s;tands by it &s;elf, appears an old for&s;ak'n Fortre&s;s: it is near the Highway, and a River, which falls into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, after it has cro&s;s'd the Province of <HI>Guilan,</HI> where it is cut into &s;everal Chanels. But generally the Corn and Fruits which grow in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by the help of Water forc'd into Chanels, are of little e&s;teem, and much cheaper than tho&s;e that grow in the Provinces who&s;e Fertility is not Arti|ficial. Moreover, that &s;ort of forc'd Grain will not keep above a Year; and if you keep it longer, it breeds a Vermin that eats it. 'Tis the &s;ame thing if the Corn be ground; and more than that, there breeds a Worm in the Flower, that makes it &s;o bitter that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to eat it.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide the Mountain <HI>Kaplenton</HI> appear at a di&s;tance two others very high, one toward the North call'd <HI>Saveland,</HI> another toward the South call'd <HI>Sehand:</HI> there is a third, which cannot be &s;een in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI>-Road, being two far out of the way, near the City of <HI>Hamadan.</HI> The&s;e three Mountains are full of Springs, from whence mo&s;t of the Streams do fall that water <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> And the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> do &s;ay, that formerly there were many more of the&s;e Springs, but that about a hundred Years ago &s;everal of them have been dry'd up, or otherwi&s;e no body can tell what is become of them.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Villages near the Mountain that pay nothing to the King, but are oblig'd to &s;end him a certain quantity of Rice and Butter, for the u&s;e of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> at <HI>Arde&uuml;il.</HI> They have al&s;o one great Priviledge, That if a Man commits a Murther, and flyes to any of the&s;e Villages, he cannot be apprehended, nor can the King him&s;elf puni&s;h him.</P>
<P>Leaving the River that runs at the foot of the Mountain <HI>Kaplenton,</HI> you come to a fair Inn call'd <HI>T&s;hamalava,</HI> built &s;ome years ago: and for thirteen hours after&punc; travelling over a very barren Country, you meet with another Inn, which is call'd <HI>Sartcham,</HI> &s;tanding in a very de&s;ert place: which makes the <HI>Raders,</HI> that lye there to &s;ecure the Highways, very in&s;olent, finding them&s;elves &s;o far from any Towns or Villages.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sartcham</HI> you come to a River, by the Banks whereof you travel a good while, till you come to an Inn which is call'd <HI>Digb&eacute;,</HI> near a large Village. The Structure is very hand&s;om, the lower part being of Free-&s;tone undulated with red and white, and very hard.</P>
<P>The next day you travel a very uneven Country, till you fall into a deep Valley, at the end whereof you meet with <HI>Zangan,</HI> a great Town and ill built. How|ever, it has a very fair Inn, which when I went la&s;t to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> was &s;o full, that I had like to have lain abroad in the Rain, but for the Courte&s;ie of two <HI>Ar|menians.</HI> From <HI>Zangan</HI> you go to an Inn, where you mu&s;t pay the Duties due to the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Sultanie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sultanie</HI> is a very large City, which you leave half a Mile from the Road, near to a Mountain. Formerly it had in it very beautiful <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> as may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd by the Ruines that remain. Many Chri&s;tian Churches al&s;o were con|verted
<PB N="28" REF="26">
into <HI>Mo&s;quees;</HI> and if you will believe the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they will tell you, that there were in <HI>Sultanie</HI> near eight hundred Churches and Chapels.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from <HI>Sultanie</HI> &s;tands an Inn, and a League farther a great Town call'd <HI>Ija,</HI> where there is another very commodious Inn, and mo&s;t excellent Wine.</P>
<P>From thence you go to <HI>Habar,</HI> an ancient City and of a large extent, but very much ruin'd, inhabited by <HI>Armenians</HI> for the mo&s;t part: Here, for the good Wines &s;ake the Travellers &s;tay to recruit their Bottles.</P>
<P>From <HI>Habar,</HI> after &s;even hours travel you come to a Village call'd <HI>Partin.</HI> From <HI>Zangan</HI> to <HI>Partin</HI> you reach in two days. It &s;tands in a fertil Plain, where there are &s;everal other Villages. It is not above three Leagues broad, being enclos'd on each &s;ide, to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, with a row of high Mountains.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd this Plain, you come to a barren Country and ill inhabited, which la&s;ts all the day, till you come to <HI>Saxava.</HI> You pa&s;s by the Ruines of a Village, where there are but two Hou&s;es &s;tanding, with the Tower of a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which is very high and &s;lender. Then you come to a Mud-wall'd-Inn, built &s;ome few years &s;ince; and near to that a Ca&s;tle call'd <HI>Khiara,</HI> upon the peek of a Hill, but very ill built.</P>
<P><HI>Sexava</HI> is a little City in a Soil that bears excellent Nuts. The Inns that are there being built of Earth, and being but little, are very hand&s;om and covenient, their number &s;upplying the defect of their &s;malne&s;s.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sexava,</HI> after &s;even hours travel, you come to a great Inn, call'd <HI>Idgloup,</HI> which was formerly a nobler place than now it is, &s;tanding alone in a Field. Three Leagues from thence you meet with another &s;pacious Inn, call'd <HI>Cochkeria;</HI> and four hours farther you come to the Inn <HI>Dengh&eacute;,</HI> where the two Roads meet which I &s;pake of in the foregoing Chapter.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dengh&eacute;</HI> to <HI>Kom</HI> are three days journey, over a barren, dry, and de&s;ert Country, where there is no Water but Ci&s;tern-water, except in &s;ome very few places, where it is very good. Four Leagues from <HI>Dengh&eacute;</HI> is a fair Inn; and three Leagues farther &s;tands another, about a Mile from a Village to the South, where there grows excellent good Wine, white and red. From this la&s;t Inn to <HI>Sava</HI> is not above three hours travel with the <HI>Caravan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sava</HI> is a good City in a fertil Plain, where there are &s;everal Villages. The greate&s;t Trade of the Town is in little grey Lamb-skins, the curl whereof is very neat, of which they make Furrs. Two or three Leagues beyond <HI>Sava</HI> the Country is very well manur'd, and after you have forded a River half a League from the City, after two hours travel you come to one of the faire&s;t Inns in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which was fini&s;h'd when I went la&s;t to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> From thence to <HI>Kom</HI> it is about &s;even or eight ho&uacute;rs journey, through a dry and &s;andy Road: but half a League on this &s;ide <HI>Kom</HI> the Land is very good and fruitful.</P>
<P><HI>Kom</HI> is one of the great Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in a fat Country abounding in Rice. There grow al&s;o excellent Fruits, particularly large and excellent Granates. The Walls are only of earth, with little Towers clo&s;e one to another; and the Hou&s;es being only of Earth, are never the hand &s;omer within&s;ide. At the entry into the Town, you mu&s;t cro&s;s a River, over a &s;tone Bridge, and then turning to the right hand over a fair Key, you come to an Inn very well built and very convenient.</P>
<P>That which is mo&s;t remarkable in <HI>Kom</HI> is a large <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> no le&s;s in veneration a|mong the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> than the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> of <HI>Arde&uuml;il.</HI> There it is that you may &s;ee the Se|pulchers of <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> and <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the Second; as al&s;o the Tomb of <HI>Sidi-Fatima,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Iman-Hocen,</HI> who was the Son of <HI>Haly</HI> and <HI>Fatima-Zuhra</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The great Gate of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> an&s;wers to a <HI>Piazza</HI> more long than broad, where &s;tands an Inn and certain Shops, which without-&s;ide are &s;omewhat beautiful. One of the &s;ides of the <HI>Piazza</HI> is clos'd up with a low Wall, over which appears the Shore, and a River which you cro&s;s at the end of the <HI>Piazza.</HI> Over the great Portal of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> &s;tands an In&s;cription, in Letters of Gold, in the prai&s;e of <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the Second. The fir&s;t place that you enter into is a Court of more length than breadth, which may be term'd a Garden, in regard that on each &s;ide of the Alley in the middle, which is pav'd, there are &s;everal &s;quare Beds of Flowers, yellow Ja&s;min, and other Plants; which are rail'd in by a Rail that runs all the length of the Alley on each &s;ide. It is not an ea&s;ie thing for the Chri&s;tians to
<PB N="29" REF="26">
get in to this Court, e&s;pecially &s;uch who&s;e Habits and A&s;pect they do not like: But as I cloth'd and carry'd my &s;elf, I never was deny'd entrance into any place ei|ther in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> or <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>In this fir&s;t Court on the left hand as you enter, are little Chambers, where they that receive the Alms, which by the Foundation of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> are to be di&s;tri|buted every day, come and eat their proportion, and then go their ways. Tho&s;e Chambers &s;erve as an <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> to tho&s;e that cannot pay their Debts, as at the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> of <HI>Arde&uuml;il.</HI> Neither are the&s;e Priviledg'd places like ours, where they that retire mu&s;t live at their own Charge: For in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they are &s;ed at the expence of the <HI>Mo&s;quee;</HI> and being in that manner freed from Care, their Friends more ea&s;ily bring their Creditors to Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Out of the fir&s;t Court you pa&s;s into a &s;econd, which is larger, and all pav'd; and from that into a third, which is &s;quare, and rais'd like a Terra&s;s. You enter into it through a large Gate, at the end of an open Pa&s;&s;age, where &s;tand the Lodgings of the <HI>Moullah's.</HI></P>
<P>Out of that Court by an a&s;cent of Brickwork of ten or twelve Steps, you enter into a fair Court, which is al&s;o rais'd like a Terra&s;s; in the mid&s;t whereof is a fair Fountain. It is continually fill'd by little Pipes of Water which run into it, and is empty'd by others that carry the Water into &s;everal parts of the whole Enclo&s;ure. There are &s;ome Buildings in this Court, but one of the &s;ides of it is taken up with the Front of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which is no di&s;plea&s;ing Structure. There are three large Gates belong to it, very well expanded, according to the mode of the Country; with a Brick-wall before, about the height of a Man, with Holes in it for Light, made like a Lozange. The Thre&s;hold of the middle Gate is Cover'd with a plate of Silver; and between the&s;e three Gates and that of the <HI>Duomo,</HI> are &s;everal Doctors that hold Books in their hands, and read perpetually.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> is Octagonal, and at every angle is a &s;mall wooden Door of Walnut|tree, varni&s;h'd with grey and yellow. The Tomb of <HI>Sidi-Fatima</HI> is at the farther part of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> there being only room for one Man to pa&s;s between the Wall and the Tomb. It is encompa&s;s'd with a large Silver Grate, &s;ixteen Foot &s;quare; the Bars whereof are round, and knob'd in tho&s;e places where they cro&s;s each other; it is lighted by &s;everal Lamps of Gold and Silver: which altogether is very plea&s;ing to the Eye. The in&s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> to the elevation of the Angles that &s;upport the <HI>Duomo,</HI> is compos'd of &s;quare Tiles varni&s;h'd over with divers Colours; and the <HI>Cupola</HI> of the <HI>Duomo,</HI> as al&s;o the Vault of the <HI>Portico</HI> of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> is a <HI>More&s;co</HI> piece of Painting in Or and Azure. Upon each &s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> and near the &s;ide where the Tomb of <HI>Sidi-Fatima</HI> &s;tands, appears a great Hall, where the Royal Alms are di&s;tributed to the Poor, which con&s;i&s;t of Pilaw and other diet, very well dre&s;t. From this Tomb you turn to the left hand toward an A&s;cent, di&s;tant five and twenty or thirty Paces; and at the top of this A&s;cent is a Door, over which there is an In|&s;cription in Honour of <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the Second. The Door being open'd, &s;hews you the place where the Body of that King repo&s;es: and through another Door with a Grate in it, you may di&s;cover, under a &s;mall <HI>Duomo,</HI> the Tomb of <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> his Father; which is cover'd with a Carpet of Cloth of Gold. They were conti|nually at work upon the Tomb of <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> which they &s;aid, they would make very famous.</P>
<P>I had not been two hours in <HI>Kom,</HI> but a multitude of People ran by the Inn Gate, all in extraordinary ha&s;t. Asking what the matter was, they an&s;wer'd me, that it had been a day long de&s;ign'd for the two <HI>Prophets</HI> to fight. Thereupon I went to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> which was &s;o crowded, that I had much ado to get to &s;ee. In the fir&s;t place a &s;ufficient number of Tumblers and Puppet players, divided into two Bands, kept the middle of the <HI>Piazza,</HI> and made a &s;ufficient Ring for the Combat. Each Band held a Bull by the Horns, one of which they call'd <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the other <HI>Haly:</HI> and whether it where by accident, or by the cunning of the Bull-Ma&s;ters, after an ob&s;tinate Combat, wherein the Bea&s;ts foam'd again with heat and rage; <HI>Mahomet</HI> at length quit the Field, and yielded <HI>Haly</HI> the Victory. Then all the People &s;houted for joy, and all the <HI>Piazza</HI> was fill'd with the noi&s;e of Flutes and Hautboys; and every one coming as if it were to adore <HI>Haly,</HI> cry'd out, <HI>Behold the Works of God, that</HI> Haly <HI>has made!</HI> At length they bring the Bull <HI>Haly</HI> under a Gate, with his Head turn'd toward the People; where after they
<PB N="30" REF="27">
have rub'd him to refre&s;h him, after a Combat &s;o courageou&s;ly maintain'd, every one &s;ends him Pre&s;ents, which are all the Tumblers profit. The <HI>Kan</HI> or Governour of <HI>Kom,</HI> who was pre&s;ent with a hundred Hor&s;es richly trap'd to behold the Sight, &s;ent the Bull a Pre&s;ent of 50 <HI>Tomans,</HI> or 750 Crowns. They who accompany'd him, and the chief Inhabitants of <HI>Kom,</HI> gave him &s;ome a Garment, others a Girdle. Neither did the meane&s;t of the People &s;pare to &s;end or carry him Fruits, or other things, according to their abilities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kan</HI> was a Lord who was very civil, and there was no Stranger that did not commend his behaviour, in regard he was &s;o obliging.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as I came to the place, whether it was that he perceiv'd me with a <HI>Dutch|man</HI> that I had brought along from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or whether any one had inform'd him that there were Strangers near him, he &s;ent for us, and after he had ask'd us &s;ome Que&s;tions concerning the occa&s;ion of our Travelling, he &s;ent for a Seat and caus'd us to &s;it down. Then he ask'd us whence we came, and what we did at <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> to which when we had an&s;wer'd him, that we went to wait upon the King, he ap|proved our Intention, complaining that we had not given him advice of our Arrival. In the Evening he &s;ent us &s;everal Delicacies, among the re&s;t, &s;ix fair Melons, and four Bottles of excellent Wine.</P>
<P>He appear'd to me &s;o brave and generous a Per&s;on, that I was very much trou|bled afterwards for his being in dis&punc;favour with the King, and his death, which en&s;u'd. For this <HI>Kan</HI> finding the Walls of the City, which were only of Earth, and the Bridge over the River to be out of repair, without writing to the King, of his own head, laid a &s;light Impo&s;ition upon every Basket of Fruit that was brought into the City. Now there are in all the Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> per&s;ons who are hir'd to take an account every Week what the Commodities may be worth, and to take care that no more than &s;uch a Toll be laid upon any thing; which they tax among them&s;elves, and when they had &s;et the Rate, they cau&s;e it to be cry'd at the beginning of every Week. <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> then reign'd, it being the year 1632. The King being inform'd by the&s;e people of the Impo&s;t which the <HI>Kan</HI> had &s;et upon Fruit without his knowledge, was &s;o enrag'd again&s;t him, that he caus'd him to be brought in Chains to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he us'd him with a &s;trange &s;everity. For at that time the Son of the <HI>Kan</HI> &s;tood at the King's Elbow, it being his Office to give him his Pipe and his Tobacco, which is a very honourable Employment in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> When the <HI>Kan</HI> came, the King caus'd him to be carry'd to the Gate of the Palace, in the pre&s;ence of all the People, and then commanded his Son to pull the Hair of his Father's Mu&s;taches by the roots from his Skin. After that he commanded him to cut off his No&s;e and his Ears; after that to put out his Eyes, and la&s;tly to cut off his Head. When he had done the Execution according to the King's plea&s;ure, he commanded him to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Fathers Government, and allowing him an experienc'd Old Man for his Lieutenant, he &s;ent him to <HI>Kom</HI> with the&s;e words; <HI>If thou govern'&s;t no better than this dead Dog has done, I will put thee to a more cruel Death than this.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Kom,</HI> for four hours you travel over a fair Champain Country, after which you come to a fair Village with five or &s;ix Inns in it. Beyond that is nothing but Sand, till you come to a place call'd <HI>Ab&s;chirim,</HI> or <HI>Fre&s;h-water,</HI> where there are three Inns at a Di&s;tance from any Villages. From <HI>Ab&s;chirim</HI> to <HI>Cachan</HI> is &s;ix hours journey through a Corn Country, and &s;tor'd with great Villages.</P>
<P><HI>Cachan</HI> is a large City, well peopl'd, and furni&s;h'd with all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: There is an old Wall about it which is faln down in many places, &s;o that there is no need of &s;eeking for Gates to get into the City. On that &s;ide which looks toward <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the Soil is good, and produces great &s;tore of Fruit and Wine, which the <HI>Jews</HI> take care to make. It is reckon'd that there are in <HI>Cachan</HI> a thou&s;and Families of <HI>Jews;</HI> in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> about &s;ix hundred; but in <HI>Kom</HI> there are not above nine or ten. Not but that there are many <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but tho&s;e that live in <HI>I&s;pahan, Cachan</HI> and <HI>Kom,</HI> boa&s;t them&s;eves particularly of the Tribe of <HI>Judah.</HI></P>
<P>There are an abundance of Silk-Weavers in <HI>Chachan</HI> that are very good Work|men, which make all the be&s;t purfl'd Sattins mix'd with Gold and Silver, that come out of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> There they al&s;o coyn Money, and make Copper-ve&s;&s;els, which they vend in great quantities at a good di&s;tance off.

ones, and well vaulted, the Inns large and convenient: but there was one among the re&s;t which was very magnificent, near the King's Gardens, at the entry of the City. As well the Inn as the Gardens were made by the order of <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> the fir&s;t of that Name, who was at a va&s;t charge. The Inn is above a hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ed Paces &s;quare, built of Brick two Stories high, containing twenty-&s;ix vaulted Chambers of a rea&s;onable bigne&s;s. It was a Structure too fair to be &s;o little regarded, as now it is, being much faln to deca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. In the middle of the Court was a Fountain to receive Water, which is &s;poil'd. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> are of that bad humor, rather to build new Hou&s;es than to repair old Buildings. For which rea&s;on they have &s;ince built at <HI>Cachin</HI> four or five Inns, as fair and commodious as that of <HI>Sha-Abas.</HI> This Cu&s;tom is grown to that height, that the Children are &s;o far from taking care to repair the old Hou&s;es where their Parents liv'd, that they will not &s;o much as live in them after their decea&s;e, covetous of the honour of building Hou&s;es for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before we le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ve <HI>Cachan</HI> you mu&s;t take notice, that as you are to travel from that City to <HI>Guilan,</HI> you cannot avoid travelling thorough Plains for twelve hours together, which are all pure Salt; and there is nothing to be met with by the way, but one Ci&s;tern; nor can the Water which is in it be otherwi&s;e than very bad.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Cachan,</HI> you cro&s;s a Plain of three Leagues, after which you enter in among the Mountains, where you come to a very fair Inn of Brick. From thence you de&s;cend a plea&s;ant Vale, where you travel a long time by the &s;ide of a Ri|ver, over a ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> narrow way. At the end of the Valley you meet a great Wall, which cro&s;&s;es it, and joyns the two Mountains together. This Wall is above a hundred Paces long, above thirty Foot thick, and fifty high. It was the <HI>Work</HI> of the Great <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> who&s;e de&s;ign it was to &s;top the Waters that fall from the Mountain, and to make a Receptacle for Water in that place, to &s;erve his occa&s;ions. At the foot of the Wall there is a Sluce, which being let down keeps in the Water; but is pull'd up to let out the Water over all the neighbouring Lands to the Plain of <HI>Cachan.</HI> From this Receptacle to <HI>Coro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> is about two hours travel.</P>
<P><HI>Corou</HI> is a very large Village, and well peopl'd, in a Soil environ'd with high Mountains, and planted with great &s;tore of Walnut-trees. The Hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t but of one low Story, being built of Flint-&s;tone; but the Inn therein is very fair and commodious. This Village con&s;i&s;ts but of one Street, but it is almo&s;t half a League long, and very trouble&s;om in the Winter, by rea&s;on of a great River that runs through it&punc; and the great quantity of Stones that lye in the way. All about this Village, as in &s;everal other places of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there are a great number of <HI>Sha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ales;</HI> which are a kind of Foxes, that in the night time make an ugly noi&s;e; for if but one cry, all the re&s;t will make an&s;wer, and &s;et up a howling.</P>
<P>From <HI>Corou</HI> you mu&s;t travel three Leagues between Mountains, after which you have but twelve Leagues to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> It is a continued Plain that extends it &s;elf beyond the City, and in many places the Soil is very good. At every three Leagues end you meet with Inns. The fir&s;t is call'd <HI>Achaha-Acacamala;</HI> the &s;econd, which is the half-way between <HI>Corou</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is call'd <HI>Michiacour.</HI> This place con&s;i&s;ts not only of one Inn, for there are many others, &s;o that it re&s;embles a large Vil|lage.

<P><HI>SMyrna</HI> is at this day for Trade, whether it be by Sea or Land, one of the mo&s;t celebrated Cities of all the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the greate&s;t Market for all &s;orts of Commodities which are tran&s;ported out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> or out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Hither all the We&s;tern Fleets are mo&s;t regularly bound, that came formerly no farther than <HI>Ligorn,</HI> and from whence, at times mo&s;t regularly appointed, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aire&s;t <HI>Caravans</HI> &s;et out.</P>
<P>This City lyes in 50 Degrees of Longitude; and 38 Degrees, 45 Minutes of Latitude; at the bottom of a Gulf in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which is &s;even Leagues in length, upon the right &s;ide of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> which begins to form the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Clazomene,</HI> right again&s;t the I&s;land of <HI>Schio.</HI> It lyes in that part of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, under the Name of <HI>Iconium;</HI> at a di&s;tance almo&s;t equal, between <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> and <HI>Sardis;</HI> and was one of the &s;even Churches mention&punc;d in the Revelation of St. <HI>John.</HI> It is at this day a great City, built like an Amphitheater, upon the de&s;cent of a Hill that looks toward the Summer-We&s;t. But it is neither &s;o great, nor &s;o beautiful as formerly it was, as may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd by the Ruines of certain Edifices that remain upon that Hill, which from the middle to the top, where the ancient City &s;tood, are altogether uninhabited. There are al&s;o to be &s;een the Walls of a fair Ca&s;tle, and above that the Ruines of an Amphi|theater, where they &s;ay St. <HI>Polycarp</HI> was expos'd to fight with Lions.

The <HI>Turks</HI> have almo&s;t quite de&s;troy'd it: making u&s;e of the Stones to build a Fort two Leagues from the City, upon the Gulf, where the pa&s;&s;age is very narrow; which the Ships are forc'd to &s;alute as they inter in, and to &s;peak with when they &s;ail ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Moreover, that they might not be put to &s;end for Stones a-far-off, they con&s;ulted whether they might not make u&s;e of the Stones of the Chri&s;tians Monuments, as al&s;o of tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which are near the Shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; But they took very few, whether out of kindne&s;s to the Tombs, or whether they did not think them &s;o proper for u&s;e as the Stones of the Amphitheater.

<P><HI>Smyrna</HI> has been oftentimes ruin'd either by the Wars, or by the Earthquakes which often happen there.

I &s;ent it to <HI>Paris</HI> to a Per&s;on of Quality, who look'd upon it as a great Curio&s;ity.

There are al&s;o <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uits, and <HI>Italian</HI> Ob&s;ervantins, or a &s;ort of Grey <HI>Franci&s;cans.</HI> The <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> live upon the Hill; but all the lower part toward the Sea is inhabited only by the <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tians, <HI>Engli&s;h, French, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Italians.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> have al&s;o in the &s;ame Quar|ter an old Church, and &s;ome few &s;mall Hou&s;es, where Sea-men make merry.</P>
<P>All the&s;e different People of <HI>Europe</HI> are generally known in <HI>Smyrna</HI> by the Name of <HI>Franks.</HI> Every Nation has its <HI>Con&s;ul:</HI> and the <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> has two <HI>Vice-Con&s;uls</HI> under him; the one at <HI>Scalanova,</HI> the other at <HI>Chio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scalanova,</HI> or the <HI>New Port,</HI> is two Leagues beyond <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and being a good Haven, the Ve&s;&s;els were wont to unlade there; but the <HI>Turks</HI> would not permit it any longer. For that Place being the Dowry of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Mother, the <HI>Vice-Con&s;ul</HI> agreed with the Governour of <HI>Scalanova,</HI> who permitted the Tran&s;por|tation of Goods to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which is not above three little days journey with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aravan:</HI> A thing that &s;poil'd the Trade of the City, and injur'd the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e. Whereupon they Petition'd the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> that no more Goods might be unladed at <HI>Scalanova:</HI> &s;o that now no more Ve&s;&s;els go thither, unle&s;s it be to take in fre&s;h Victuals.</P>
<P><HI>Chio</HI> is one of the greate&s;t I&s;lands in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> of which in another place: but the <HI>Vice-Con&s;ul</HI> that lives there has no more bu&s;ine&s;s there than the other at <HI>Scalanova;</HI> for the Ve&s;&s;els that touch there, neither unlade no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> export any Goods from thence.</P>
<P>The Quarter of the <HI>Franks</HI> is only a long Street, one &s;ide whereof lyes upon the Sea; and as well for the Pro&s;pect, as for the convenience of Unlading Goods, the Hou&s;es upon the Sea are much dearer than tho&s;e that lye upon the Hill.</P>
<P>The Soil about <HI>Smyrna</HI> is fertil, and abounds in all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane &s;upport; but particularly in good Oyl and good Wine. There are Salt-Pits al&s;o half a League from the City, toward the North. The Sea affords great &s;tore of good Fi&s;h; Fowl is very cheap; and in a word, <HI>Smyrna</HI> is a place of great plenty. There is a lovely Walk all along the Sea to the Salt&punc;Pits, where generally abundance of People walk in the Summer-time to take the fre&s;h Air: and there being more liberty at <HI>Smyrna</HI> than in any other part of <HI>Turkie,</HI> there is no nece&s;&s;ity of taking a <HI>Jani&s;ary</HI> along, when a man goes abroad. If a man loves Fowling, it is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aking a Boat, which lands him two or three Leagues from the City, toward the Mountains, where there is &s;o much Game that he can never return empty. For the value of three <HI>Sous</HI> you may buy a red Partridge at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and all other Fowl is proportionably cheap.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Smyrna</HI> have the&s;e great advantages, it has al&s;o its inconveniences: the Heats are very exce&s;&s;ive in Summer, and indeed they would be in&s;upportable, were it not for the Breezes that come off the Sea: the&s;e Breezes ri&s;e about ten in the Morning, and continue till the Evening; but if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, 'tis very bad for the
<PB N="34" REF="29">
Inhabitants. Be&s;ides, there hardly pa&s;&s;es a Year but the City is infe&s;ted with the Plague, which however is not &s;o violent as in Chri&s;tendom. The <HI>Turks</HI> neither fear it nor flie it, believing altogether in Prede&s;tination. Yet I believe, if the Inha|bitants of <HI>Smyrna</HI> would take care to drain away the &s;tanding Puddles that gather in the Winter about the City, they would not be &s;o frequently mole&s;ted with the Plague as they are. It is mo&s;t rife in <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> but the malignant Fevers that &s;ucceed it in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> are more to be fear'd, more People dying of them than of the Pe&s;tilence. In all my Travels I never was in <HI>Smyrna</HI> at the&s;e unfortunate Sea&s;ons. There is no <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> in that City; it being govern'd only by a <HI>Cady,</HI> who is not &s;o &s;evere to the Chri&s;tians as in other places: For &s;hould he abu&s;e his Office, <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is at hand, where you may complain to the <HI>Mufti,</HI> and have relief; who for &s;ome good Pre&s;ent may be ea&s;ily per&s;waded to depo&s;e the <HI>Cady,</HI> as being glad of the opportunity to di&s;place him, and to put another in his room.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;toms of <HI>Smyrna</HI> yield a great Revenue to the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> being paid there very exactly. But were there a certain Rate put upon Commodities, the Mer|chants, who would otherwi&s;e be lo&s;ers, would not &s;tudy &s;o many ways as they do to deceive the Cu&s;tomers: For tho&s;e Cu&s;tomers lay what Price they plea&s;e upon Com|modities, valuing that at a thou&s;and Crowns, which perhaps is not worth three hun|dred, being ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Rate. In my la&s;t Voyage to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> four <HI>Dutch</HI> Women that went thither in our Ship from their own Country, carry'd a-&s;hoar under their Coats whatever I had of rich Merchandize: for the <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;uch a re&s;pect for that Sex, that they will not &s;o much as offer to &s;earch them. If a man be tak'n in &s;tealing Cu&s;toms, there is no other puni&s;hment than to pay double.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Smyrna</HI> is very great, and the principal Merchandizes which the <HI>Franks</HI> tran&s;port from thence, are raw Silk, which the <HI>Armenians</HI> bring out of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> Chamlet-yarn, and Chamlet or Goats-hair, which come from a little City call'd <HI>Angouri,</HI> fifteen or &s;ixteen days journey from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> Cotton twi&s;ted; Skins and Cordovans of &s;everal colours; Calicuts, white and blew; great quantities of Wool for Mattre&s;&s;es, Tap'&s;tries, quilted Coverlets, Soap, Rhubarb, Galls, Va|lanede, Scammony, and Opium; which four la&s;t Commodities are to be had in the Countries near to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> but not in great quantities. The <HI>Caravans</HI> come generally to this Town in the Months of <HI>February, June,</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> and depart again to the Countries from whence they came the &s;ame Months.</P>
<P><HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> not being above a day and a halfs journey from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> on Hor&s;e-back-I took an opportunity to go thither. There were twelve of us that joyn'd together, <HI>Franks</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who took three <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> along with us, and three Hor&s;es to carry our Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>We travel'd this little Journey in the Summer, and &s;etting out of <HI>Smyrna</HI> about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, we rode through a Country part Plains, and part Hills, till we came to a great Village, where we &s;up'd.</P>
<P>After we had &s;taid there three hours, we took Hor&s;e and travel'd till Midnight, to avoid the Heats: By the way we met with nine or ten Arches, very narrow; which we could not conjecture to be any thing el&s;e than the Ruines of &s;ome Aque|duct. From thence to <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> the way is very plea&s;ant, through little Thickets watred with Rivulets.</P>
<P>A quarter of a League from <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> you meet with another <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which was formerly a Chri&s;tian Church, built out of the Ruines of the Temple of <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> This <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> &s;tands enclos'd with Walls, and you mu&s;t a&s;cend up to it by two A&s;cents of twelve Steps a-piece, which bring you to a large Pa&s;&s;age. From thence you enter into a large Cloy&s;ter, the Arches whereof are &s;u&s;tain'd with Marble Pillars of &s;everal colours, delicately wrought; and the lower part of the Gallery, which runs along three of the &s;ides, that con&s;i&s;ts of great Squares of Stone. The <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> takes up the fourth &s;ide upon the left hand, the Gate being in the middle. The <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> it &s;elf is a wide Arch, &s;upported by five Columns, all of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Work. There are four of Marble, and every one of a different Colour; but the fifth is a mo&s;t rare piece, being of Porphyry, aed the bigne&s;s of it makes it &s;o much the more to be admir'd.</P>
<P><HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> does not look like a City, being &s;o ab&s;olutely ruin'd, that there is not a Hou&s;e &s;tanding. It was built upon the de&s;cent of a Hill, in a &s;ituation not much
<PB N="35" REF="29">
unlike that of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> at the foot whereof runs a Rivulet, after it has made a thou&s;and <HI>Maeander<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</HI> in the Meadows. The City &s;eems to have been very large, for you may di&s;cern upon the top of the Gates the compa&s;s of the Walls, with &s;everal &s;quare Towers, &s;ome of which are &s;till &s;tanding: and there is one very remarkable, having two Chambers in it, one of which is a very fair one, the Walls and Pave|ment whereof are Marble.</P>
<P>The famous Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> &s;tood at the bottom of the Hill, near one of the Gates of the City. There remains nothing of it at pre&s;ent but the great Portal, which is entire. The Vaults of the Arches under ground &s;tand to this day, and are very large, but all full of na&s;tine&s;s. We went in with Lanthorns; and though you mu&s;t creep to get in, by rea&s;on that the Wind has almo&s;t &s;topt up the Hole, by gathering the Du&s;t about it, yet when you are in, you may go upright; for the Arches are high and fair, and little the wor&s;e. Near the Gate lye four or five Columns upon the Ground, and near to that a Fountain, ten Foot in Diameter, and two deep. The People of the Country report, that it was the Fountain wherein St. <HI>John</HI> Baptiz'd the Chri&s;tians. For my part, as I have &s;een in the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;everal <HI>Pagods</HI> and Edifices much more beautiful than ever the Temple of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> could be; I believe it rather to have been a Ba&s;in wherein the People put their Offerings, of which there are &s;everal &s;uch that belong to the <HI>Indian Pagods.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Arme|nians,</HI> but above all the <HI>Franks,</HI> when they go to <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> always endeavour to break off &s;ome piece of that Ba&s;in, to carry it away with 'em as a Relick: but the Stone is &s;o hard, that they can break off but very little at a time.</P>
<P>Not far from the Temple appears another Gate of the City, over which there lyes a great Stone &s;even or eight Foot &s;quare, with an embo&s;s'd Figure of <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> that Famous <HI>Roman,</HI> who threw him&s;elf, Hor&s;e and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ms into the gaping Earth, for the good of his Country. Many Merchants have offer'd Money for liberty to carry it away, but cannot obtain leave. About five hundred Paces from <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is the <HI>Grotto</HI> which they call the <HI>Seven Sleepers,</HI> at the bottom of the &s;ame Hill where the City was built.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> we went to <HI>Scalanova,</HI> which is not above two Leagues off. By that time you come half the way, the little River that runs by <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> falls into the Sea, in the mouth whereof there are always a great number of <HI>Greek</HI> Barks fi&s;hing for Sturgeon. Of the Spawn of this Fi&s;h they make <HI>Caveare,</HI> and drive a great Trade in it in tho&s;e Parts: then they take the mo&s;t delicate and &s;malle&s;t Entrails of that Fi&s;h, which they fill with the &s;ame Spawn, of which they make a kind of a flat Pudding, as long as a Bisket, which they call <HI>Botargo.</HI> This they dry in the Smoak, and cut it afterwards in &s;lices to eat. Upon this and the Cuttle-fi&s;h the <HI>Grecks</HI> ge|nerally feed during their <HI>Lent,</HI> which is very au&s;tere.</P>
<P><HI>Scalanova</HI> is a Port of which I have already &s;poken, and thither we came by &s;even a Clock in the Evening; where the Governour of the Place, more civil than u&s;ually the <HI>Turks</HI> are accu&s;tom'd to be, made us very welcom.</P>
<P>In the Evening one of our <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> had quarrel'd with one of our Servants, who thereupon had beaten him; and therefore he complain'd to the Fellow's Ma|&s;ter, who not giving him that &s;atisfaction which he de&s;ir'd, thereupon the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;tudy'd to be reveng'd upon the whole Company. For this rea&s;on, upon &s;ome pre|tence or other, he went before, the better to bring about his de&s;ign. We &s;taid till the Morning, and then departed early from <HI>Scalanova,</HI> and by Noon we came with good Stomachs to the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> near <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> where we had been the day before: And &s;ome of the Company thought it a very convenient place to dine in, i'the &s;hade; thereupon we &s;ent for our Provi&s;ions, with a Boracho of Wine, and ano|ther of Water, and fell to eating in the Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> not dreaming any harm. We had not been long at it, when we perceiv'd two or three <HI>Turks</HI> about two hundred Paces off, who came from a Village very near to the <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> I knowing the cu&s;tom of the Country better than they, told them, that they were certainly coming to pick a quarrel with us, and therefore caus'd them to hide the Bottle of Wine immediately; for it was then <HI>Turks Ramezan,</HI> or <HI>Lent;</HI> during which time Wine is &s;trictly forbidden. The&s;e two ill-contriv'd and ill clad Fellows were the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> of the place, whom the <HI>Cadi</HI> had&punc;&s;ent, upon the information of our <HI>Jani&s;ary</HI> (who knowing we had eaten in the &s;ame place before, as indeed we had done, made no que&s;tion but we would do &s;o again) thinking to &s;urprize us
<PB N="36" REF="30">
as we were drinking Wine, in a place which they e&s;teem Sacred, and by con&s;e|quence was among them accounted an act of Sacriledge. <HI>Chri&s;tian Dogs,</HI> cry'd they, when they came near us, <HI>to eat and drink in a</HI> Mo&s;quee, <HI>and profane a holy place as you do, at a time that renders the offence more criminal! No,</HI> cry'd I, an&s;wering for the re&s;t, <HI>we drink no Wine, we drink nothing but Water, and you may ta&s;t it,</HI> &s;aid I to him that was the mo&s;t bu&s;ie; with that I caus'd a Gla&s;s to be pour'd out and giv'n him; and I gave one of the <HI>Turks</HI> a private wink, who under&s;tanding it was a promi&s;e of gratuity, turn'd about to his Comrades, and cry'd, <HI>'Tis very true, they drink no Wine.</HI> However in regard they had Orders to bring us before the <HI>Cady,</HI> there was no contending. Thereupon I and three others undertook to an&s;wer for all the re&s;t. The <HI>Cady</HI> revil'd us as bad as the <HI>Jani&s;ary</HI> at fir&s;t; but he was not only &s;urpriz'd, but very much troubl'd, when they all unanimou&s;ly affirm'd that we drank no Wine, believing they were confederates with us. But I had cunningly &s;lipt eight Ducats into the Hand of the <HI>Turk</HI> to whom I had made a &s;ign with my Eye, who over-joy'd at &s;o plentiful a gratuity, had over-per&s;waded his Comrades not to &s;ay any thing again&s;t us. The <HI>Cady,</HI> though he did not like their Te&s;timony, yet call'd for <HI>Coffee</HI> for us, according to the cu&s;tom of the Country, and &s;ent us to his Lieutenant; who having been often greas'd in the Fi&s;t by the <HI>Smyrna</HI>-Merchants, receiv'd us very kindly, and told us that the <HI>Cady</HI> was but newly come to his Place, and was needy; however a &s;mall matter would content him. There|upon we gave the Lieutenant twenty-five Ducats, who mo&s;t certainly went &s;nips with the <HI>Cady,</HI> and &s;o return'd us to our Company, who were much afraid we would not have come off &s;o.</P>
<P>We were re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>Smyrna</HI> not the &s;ame way we came, and &s;o we took another Road, which was a very plea&s;ant way, partly over firm Sands, and partly thorough Meadows, where we met with &s;everal narrow Dikes very well Pav'd. Then we cro&s;s a rugged high Mountain, and lay in a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Barn.</P>
<P>The next day we return'd to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> having fini&s;h'd our &s;mall Journey to <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> in five days. When we told the <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> how the <HI>Janizary</HI> had betray'd us, they made their Complaint to the <HI>Janizary Aga</HI> and the <HI>Cady,</HI> who, for his puni&s;hment put him out of the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s &s;ervice, which is an advantageous Employment. For be&s;ides that the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s <HI>Janizaries</HI> are exempt from the Duties of War, they are well plac'd; for there is never a Merchant that is not beneficial to them &s;ome way or other; e&s;pecially at good times, as <HI>New-years-day</HI> and other Fe&s;tivals. Nor could the <HI>Janizary</HI> have been more &s;everely puni&s;h'd; for the <HI>Turks</HI> love Money above all things in the World.</P>
<P>But to return to our matter. The Rendezvouz of all the <HI>Caravans</HI> is generally two Leagues from the City, near a Town call'd <HI>Pongarbachi.</HI> The day of their &s;etting out being fix'd, every one provides him&s;elf for his Journey, and meets the Evening before at the place appointed, to be ready at the hour.</P>
<P>From <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Tocat,</HI> is thirty-five days journey with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> and the la&s;t time I went we made it thirty-eight from <HI>Pongarbachi.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we travel'd eight hours through a Country who&s;e pro&s;pect was not unplea&s;ing, leaving &s;ome Villages more than a League from the Road; and we lodg'd in a Park, near the River <HI>Pactolus;</HI> which is a &s;mall River, the Sand whereof &s;hines, and is of &s;everal colours. Which caus'd Antiquity to call <HI>Pactolus</HI> Golden-Sanded. It falls from the Mountain <HI>Tmolus,</HI> and after it has water'd the Territory of <HI>Sardis,</HI> mixes with the River <HI>Hermus,</HI> that throws it &s;elf into the <HI>Archipelago</HI> through the Gulph of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> The Mouth of it is not above two or three Leagues from the City, toward the North.</P>
<P>The next day in &s;ix hours we came to <HI>Durgout,</HI> a little City in a Plain. All Chri&s;tians that live not in the Territories of the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> and pa&s;s that way, once a Year pay <HI>Carrage,</HI> or a Tribute of four or five Crowns: but the <HI>Franks</HI> are exempt, both at <HI>Durgout</HI> and over all <HI>Turkie.</HI> There re&s;ides a <HI>Ba&s;hae</HI> in this City; and we were con&s;train'd to &s;top there a whole day, becau&s;e the <HI>Caravan</HI> that comes from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> arriv'd at that time, &s;o that they were fore'd to change their Camels.</P>
<P>The third day, after five hours travel in extremity of Heat, we came to lodge near a paltry Village.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="30">
The fourth day we travel'd &s;ix hours, and &s;top'd near to a &s;mall River. In the Morning we pa&s;s'd over the Ruines of the ancient <HI>Sardis,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and Seat of King <HI>Croe&s;us.</HI> There were &s;till to be &s;een the Ruines of a large Palace and two fair Churches, with a great number of Pillars and Corniches of Marble. This City having held out &s;ix Years again&s;t the Army of <HI>Temur-leng,</HI> who be&s;ieg'd it; &s;o &s;oon as he had taken it, in revenge he utterly de&s;troy'd it. There is a Village near <HI>Sardis</HI> of the &s;ame Name, where &s;tood the City, which was one of the Seven Churches mention'd in the <HI>Revelation.</HI> The fifth day we rode for &s;even hours through a Country, but ill manur'd, and took up our Stage in a Plain upon the &s;ide of a River.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day we pa&s;s'd by the Walls of the ancient <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> call'd at pre&s;ent <HI>Allachars,</HI> which was al&s;o one of the Seven Churches of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> There is &s;omething of Beauty &s;till remaining in tho&s;e Walls, and the City is very large, but ill peopl'd. It is &s;ituated upon four little Hills, at the foot of a high Mountain over-looking a fair Plain to the North, that produces excellent Fruit. To witne&s;s its Antiquity, there is yet the Ruines of an Amphitheater, with certain Sepulchers&punc; from whence the Inhabitants report that the <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tians took out the Bodies that were buried there, and tran&s;ported them into <HI>Europe,</HI> believing them to be the Bodies of Saints. It is now all de&s;troy'd, but re-built of Earth by the <HI>Turks</HI> after their mode. It was formerly one of the principal Cities of <HI>My&s;ia,</HI> and in regard it was alway very &s;ubject to Earthquakes, the mo&s;t part of her Inhabitants liv'd in the Country. The la&s;t time I travel'd that way, in the year 1664, the &s;eventeenth of <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> were fea&s;ting and rejoycing upon the News, as they &s;aid, which they had receiv'd, of the defeat of the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Candy.</HI> But the News was fal&s;e, and only con|triv'd to encourage the People; for the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> was then making Levies in tho&s;e Parts. We lodg'd that day, after &s;even hours travel, upon the Bank of a &s;mall River, a League and a half from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eventh day we travel'd eleven hours over a Mountain, where tho&s;e Trees plentifully grow that bear Galls, and Valanede, which is the &s;hell or rind of an Acorn, that Curriers make u&s;e of to dre&s;s their Leather. We lodg'd in a Meadow on the top of a Mountain which is call'd <HI>Ijagli-boga&s;e,</HI> or, <HI>The Mountain of Robbers.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth day we continu'd our Journey over the &s;ame Mountain, which is a very barren Country where there is no Provi&s;ion to be had. We travel'd but &s;ix hours, and lodg'd near a River in a Plain call'd <HI>Sarroucabaqui.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth day the <HI>Caravan</HI> travel'd thorough dry Lands, where there is not one Village to be &s;een, and lodg'd near a Bridge built over a River call'd <HI>Copli-&s;ou,</HI> in the Plain of <HI>Inahi.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth day, after we had travel'd eight hours over an uneven and barren Coun|try, we &s;topt in a Valley near a River call'd <HI>Bana-&s;ou,</HI> the Water whereof is not good. In the Night there aro&s;e a Tempe&s;t that put us all in a di&s;order, and the Rain that fell was as cold as if it had been in the depth of Winter. We were wet to the Skins, and were forc'd to throw Coverlets over the Bales to keep the Goods from being &s;poyl'd.</P>
<P>The eleventh day we travel'd through a plea&s;ant Country, between Vales adorn'd with a mo&s;t delightful Verdure; and we were in view as we pa&s;s'd along of certain hot Baths, though very little regarded. We lodg'd upon the Banks of a &s;mall River, by the &s;ide whereof we had travel'd for &s;ome hours.</P>
<P>The twelfth day we continu'd our Road for &s;ix hours between the &s;ame Vallies, and lodg'd by a River.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day, we travel'd eight hours&punc; and &s;top'd near to a Village in a Country call'd <HI>Do&uuml;ga&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth, after a Journey of &s;even hours we pa&s;s'd by the Walls of <HI>Aphiom-Cara&s;&s;ar,</HI> that is, <HI>The Black City of Aphiom</HI> or <HI>Opium;</HI> becau&s;e it has a Pro&s;pect over a fair and large Country well cultivated, where they &s;ow great &s;tore of Pop|pies, whence they draw their <HI>Opium</HI> or <HI>Aphiom,</HI> as the <HI>Turks</HI> call it.</P>
<P><HI>Aphiom-Cara&s;&s;ar,</HI> is a great City, dirty and ill built, the ancient Name whereof I could never learn, for the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> are very ignorant. But ac|cording to all probability and the &s;ituation of the place, it ought to be the ancient <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rapolis</HI> &s;ituated upon the <HI>Maander,</HI> a famous River of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that

winds and turns the mo&s;t of any River in the World. And indeed we are the more to &s;eek, in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> change the ancient Names according to their own cu&s;tom and plea&s;ure, and give no other Names to Rivers than that of the principal City through which they pa&s;s; or el&s;e deriving their Names from the Colour of their Sands. There is to be &s;een in that City an ancient Ca&s;tle of Free-&s;tone upon the Point of a high Rock, &s;eparated from the Mountains that are next it toward the South, which make a Semicircle. All the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians, Subjects to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thorough <HI>Aphiom Cara&s;&s;ar</HI> mu&s;t there pay <HI>Carrage,</HI> from which they are not exempted, though they have paid it before at <HI>Erzerom</HI> or el&s;ewhere. The <HI>Caravan</HI> does not &s;top at <HI>Aphiom-Cara&s;&s;ar,</HI> as well for that there are no Inns but what are ruin'd, as for that about a League farther there is a place where you have excellent Fi&s;h, and very cheap, and they of the City bring Barley, Straw, and other things which the <HI>Caravan</HI> wants. The <HI>Caravan</HI> therefore that day lodges upon the Banks of <HI>Maeander,</HI> which is to be cro&s;s'd over a Bridge not far di&s;tant from a &s;mall Village. In this River are great &s;tore of Crawfi&s;h and Carps; and the Fi&s;her|men will be &s;ure to attend upon the <HI>Caravan.</HI> I have &s;een &s;ome Carps there above three Foot long.</P>
<P>The fifteenth our <HI>Caravan</HI> began to part it &s;elf, &s;ome for <HI>Tocat,</HI> &s;ome for the Road to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> the one part taking the right-hand. Road toward the Winter-Ea&s;t, for <HI>Syria;</HI> the other the left-hand. Road North-Ea&s;t, for <HI>Armenia.</HI></P>
<P>After we were parted, we travel'd two or three hours in &s;ight of one another. They that go to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> fall into <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was born, and from <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> to <HI>Alexandretta.</HI> But we continu'd our Road to <HI>Tocat,</HI> and after we had cro&s;s'd a great Plain, having travel'd &s;ix hours, we lodg'd in a Mer&s;hy place near a &s;mall Village. There is one thing remarkable in this Road as in many others, which manife&s;ts the Charity of the <HI>Turks.</HI> For in mo&s;t of the high Roads, that are far from Rivers, they have &s;et up Ci&s;terns, whither when the Rains fail, the neigh|bouring Villages bring Water for the Travellers, who would el&s;e be very much di&s;tre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth we travel'd eight hours through a very even Country, but ill ma|nur'd; where we &s;aw a little City call'd <HI>Boulavandi.</HI> There are &s;ome <HI>Mo&s;quee's,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> have built out of the Ruines of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> Churches, from which they have taken Pillars of Marble, and other pieces of Architecture, to adorn their Sepulchers without any order at all, which you meet with very often upon the high Roads; the number is the greater, becau&s;e they never lay two Bodies in one Grave. There is al&s;o in this City an Inn, cover'd with Lead, which is all the Beauty of it; nor do Travellers make any u&s;e of it but only in foul weather. We lodg'd a League and a half from the City, and &s;taid there all the next day.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth we travel'd eleven hours through a mix'd and uneven Country, and came to lodge in a Village where there are not above three or four Hou&s;es, though there be excellent Pa&s;turage about it. There is no Water, but what is drawn out of three deep Wells; for which rea&s;on the place is call'd <HI>Euche derin-gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>
<P>The eighteenth we travel'd not above five hours through de&s;ert Countries, and took up our Stage in a king of a Bog, near a pitiful Village.</P>
<P>The nineteenth, after we had travell'd eight hours through &s;pacious de&s;ert Plains, we pa&s;s'd through a large Village, the Inhabitants whereof were gone with their Cattel into the Mountains, for the cool Air, during the Summer time, according to cu&s;tom. There is an indifferent hand&s;om <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> of Free-&s;tone; and indeed the Village, the Name whereof the People told me was <HI>T&s;haciclou,</HI> has been much bigger than now it is, as may appear by the Ruines. In two hours after we came to lodge beyond it in a Meadow, near a Rivulet.</P>
<P>The twentieth we cro&s;s'd over de&s;ert Plains, but which &s;eem'd to have been for|merly well manur'd; and after ten hours travel, we &s;top'd in a Bottom near a bad Water.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t, for ten hours the Country was all barren and de&s;ert, and we came to lodge at the end of a long Plain, near two Wells, the Water whereof was good for nothing.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd we travel'd through the fore-mention'd Plain, and met with little Valleys where there was very good Pa&s;turage. The <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;top'd near to a pitiful Village, and a na&s;ty Well.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="31">
The twenty-third we travel'd not above five hours; becau&s;e it was the time of the <HI>Turks Beiram,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which our <HI>Caravan,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Turks,</HI> would needs &s;olemnize. That day we travel'd through an indifferent good Country, and well till'd, where we di&s;cover'd &s;everal fair Villages; and we lodg'd upon a ri&s;ing Ground, from whence we had a very fair and far di&s;tant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth we travel'd &s;ix hours, and came to lodge in a Meadow where the Water was bad. Near to that place, we di&s;cover'd a Plain that extends it &s;elf eight or ten Leagues in length, though it be not above one or two in bredth: it &s;eem'd like a Lake; and indeed it is only a &s;alt Water congeal'd, and thickn'd into Salt, which you can hardly di&s;&s;olve but in fair Water. This Lake furni&s;hes almo&s;t all <HI>Nato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> with Salt; where you may buy a Waggon load drawn by two <HI>Bufalo's</HI> for 45 Sous.

<P>The twenty-&s;ixth we pa&s;s'd through a great Village call'd <HI>T&s;hekenagar,</HI> in a plea&s;ant &s;ituation, but very ill built; and after we had travel'd eight hours, we came to lodge in a delightful Meadow, near another Village call'd <HI>Romcouch&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh we travel'd nine hours through Countries full of Licorice, and having pa&s;s'd a great Town call'd <HI>Be&s;erguenlou,</HI> we lodg'd in a Meadow.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth we cro&s;s'd a great River call'd <HI>Jechil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">irma,</HI> over a long well built &s;tone Bridge. At the end of the Bridge call'd <HI>Ke&s;&s;r&eacute;-kupri</HI> &s;tands a great Village, wherein the greate&s;t part of the Hou&s;es are built under Ground, like Foxes Holes.

<P>The twenty-ninth we rode for &s;even hours through a plea&s;ant Country, where we &s;aw &s;everal Villages; near to one of which the <HI>Caravan</HI> lodg'd in a Meadow, clo&s;e by a Fountain.</P>
<P>The thirtieth we rode through a flat Country, well manur'd, and &s;top'd near a River wherein there was but very little Water: it is call'd <HI>Cara-&s;ou,</HI> or, <HI>The Black River.</HI> For two or three days together, at every two Leagues di&s;tance we ob&s;erv'd little Hillocks of Earth artificially rear'd, which they told us were rais'd during the Wars of the <HI>Greeks</HI> to build Forts upon, for Watch-Towers.</P>
<P>The thirty-fir&s;t we travel'd a very uneven Country, but abounding in Wheat, and after we had travel'd nine hours, we lodg'd in a Meadow, near a River, which we cro&s;s'd next Morning before day, over a &s;tone Bridge.</P>
<P>The thirty-&s;econd, after we had travel'd eight hours, we lodg'd by a River, where we &s;aw a great number of <HI>Turcomans:</HI> They are a People that live in Tents like the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and they were then leaving that Country to go to another, having their luggage in Waggons drawn by <HI>Bufalo's.</HI></P>
<P>The thirty-third we met again with Mountains and Woods, which we had not &s;een in 18 days before, which had con&s;train'd us to carry&punc; Wood upon our Camels to dre&s;s our Provi&s;ion: We were very &s;paring of it, and &s;ometimes made u&s;e of dry'd Cows dung or Camels dung, when we came near the Waters where they were wont to drink.

<P>The thirty-fourth we forded a deep and rapid River call'd <HI>Jangou,</HI> from the Name of the Town next to it. A little above the place where we forded it, we &s;aw a ruin'd Bridge, which had been built over it.</P>
<P>The thirty-fifth we travel'd eight hours through a fair Valley well manur'd, and upon the left hand we left a Ca&s;tle rais'd upon a Rock. The <HI>Caravan</HI> lay that night upon a ri&s;ing Ground near a Village.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Author was robb'd near <HI>Tocat,</HI> and of a certain &s;ort of rare and fine Wool which he fir&s;t brought into <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TAquibac</HI> is the place where the <HI>Per&s;ian Caravan</HI> u&s;es to meet, when it departs from <HI>Tocat</HI> to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and this is the only place in all the Road where a Traveller ought to &s;tand upon his guard; by rea&s;on of Thieves who haunt the&s;e Quarters, and are great Ma&s;ters in their Trade. Once as I came out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they would needs give me a ta&s;t of their Art, notwith&s;tanding all the care I took. There were three or four of us that would needs ride before with our Servants to <HI>Taquibac,</HI> in expectation of the <HI>Caravan</HI> which was to come the next day; where we &s;et up our Tents upon the Bank of a &s;mall River. I had then a good many Bales of Wool, with which I made as it were a double Wall about my Tent: &s;o that there was but one pa&s;&s;age between the Bales, for one Man. In four of the&s;e Bales I had a quantity of Musk in lead'n Boxes, to the value of ten or twelve thou&s;and Crowns: which Bales I put within-&s;ide, &s;o that they touch'd the Tent and my Beds-head. Next Night, it being very dark, the Thieves came, and finding the outward Bales &s;mell &s;o &s;trong of Musk, they thought one of tho&s;e Bales would be a con&s;iderable Booty. The Bales were all ty'd together with a Cord that kept them fa&s;t; nor was it ea&s;ie to undo them, without a noi&s;e. They wak'd me with their bu&s;tle at fir&s;t, and I &s;ent out my Servants to &s;ee if they could catch them; but they will lye &s;o clo&s;e upon their Bellies, that in &s;uch a dark Night as that was 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover them. Thereupon my Servants went to &s;leep again, and the Thieves to their Work; and having with a great deal of ingenuity cut the Cord, they carried away the two Bales. In the Morning four or five of us with a Camel-driver for our Guide pur&s;u'd them, and in half an hour we met with the marks of the Robbery; for the Rogues being mad that they found nothing but Wool, which they thought to be of no great value, &s;catter'd it in the High-way for two or three Leagues together: &s;o that I caus'd it to be pickt up again, and lo&s;t not above fifteen or twenty Pound. I &s;peak this to caution the Marchants that carry Bales of Silk or other rich Commodities, to beware of the&s;e Thieves; for they will come creeping upon their Bellies, and then cutting the Bales with great Razors, will pre&s;ently empty a Bale of one half of the Goods.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Wool was of no great value for their u&s;e; but it was a &s;ort of rare and very fine Wool, which I carry'd out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> where &s;uch fine Wool was never &s;een. As to the place where it is to be had, I met with one of the <HI>Gaures,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that adore the Fire, who when I was at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in the year 1647 &s;hew'd me a Sample of it, and inform'd me that the greate&s;t part of this Wool comes from the Province of <HI>Kerman,</HI> which is the ancient <HI>Caramania;</HI> and that the be&s;t Wool is to be met with in the Mountains that are next to the City, that bears the name of the Province: That the Sheep in tho&s;e Parts have this particular property, that when they have fed upon new Gra&s;s from <HI>January</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> the Fleece falls off of it &s;elf, and leaves the Sheep naked, and their Skins &s;mooth, like a Pig's that is &s;calded off; &s;o that there is no need of &s;hearing them, as with us: after they have
<PB N="41" REF="32">
gather'd it, they beat it, and the cour&s;e Wool breaking, the fine only remains. That if you tran&s;port it, before you make it into Bales, you mu&s;t throw Salt-water upon it, which keeps the Worms out of it, and pre&s;erves it from rotting. Now you mu&s;t take notice that they never dye this Wool, it being naturally of a clear Brown, or a dark A&s;h-colour; and that there is very little of it White, which is al&s;o much dearer than the other, as well for that it is &s;carce, as becau&s;e that the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s, the <HI>Moullah's</HI> and other per&s;ons belonging to the Law never wear any Girdles or Vails (wherewith they cover their Heads when they pray) but White: for at other times they wear them about their Necks, as the Women do their Scarfs.</P>
<P>Into this Province of <HI>Kerman</HI> almo&s;t all the <HI>Gaures</HI> are retir'd, and they are they that only Trade in this Wool, and have the whole Manufacture of it. They make tho&s;e Girdles of it which they u&s;e in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and &s;ome Pieces of Serge, which are al|mo&s;t as fine and tran&s;parent, as if they were of Silk. I brought over two Pieces into <HI>France,</HI> and pre&s;ented one to the late Queen Mother, the other to the Prin|ce&s;s of <HI>Orleance.</HI></P>
<P>I could not drive any Trade in this Wool till the year 1654, returning out of the <HI>Indies</HI> by Sea from <HI>Sura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to <HI>Ormus.</HI> To which purpo&s;e, I departed from <HI>Ormus,</HI> and took Guides along with me to &s;hew me the way to <HI>Kerman,</HI> whither I could not get on Hor&s;eback in le&s;s than twenty-&s;even days. I dare &s;ay that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great did not march this way into the <HI>Indies:</HI> for in the whole extent of the Country there is no Water to be met with but in &s;ome certain places, and in the hollow of &s;ome Rocks, where there is not enough neither to water eight or ten Hor&s;es. Be&s;ides, in &s;ome places a man is con&s;train'd, by rea&s;on of the Mountains, to fetch a great compa&s;s about; for a Foot-man that makes his way through tho&s;e Rocks, &s;hall go farther in half an hour than a Hor&s;e-man can do in four.</P>
<P><HI>Kerman</HI> is a large City, which has been often ruin'd by being &s;everal times taken and re-taken; nor is there any thing hand&s;om in it, but only one Hou&s;e and a Garden, upon which the la&s;t <HI>Kans</HI> have be&s;tow'd a va&s;t expence to make the place delightful. They make there a &s;ort of Earthen ware which comes very near to <HI>Porcelan,</HI> and looks as neat and as fine. As &s;oon as I arriv'd, I went to vi&s;it the <HI>Kan,</HI> who made me very welcom, and gave order to the <HI>Gaures</HI> to furni&s;h me with Bread and Wine, Pullets and Pigeons, which in tho&s;e parts are fat, and as large as little Capons. The <HI>Gaures</HI> are they that make the Wine; and to make it more &s;weet and plea&s;ant, they take away the Stalks, and never pre&s;s any thing but the meer Grape.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kan</HI> was but newly entred into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Government, and being de&s;irous, according to the cu&s;tom of the new Governours, to have a noble Sword and Dagger, with a rich Furniture of his Hor&s;e, which requir'd &s;ome Jewels, I pre&s;ented him with a Diamond worth eight hundred Crowns, which he caus'd to be &s;et in the end of the handle of his Dagger. He al&s;o de&s;ir'd to have of me as many more Jewels as came to &s;even or eight hundred Livres: and by the Pre&s;ent and the Bargain I facilitated my purcha&s;e of the Wool which I intended to buy. Two days afteer he invited me to his Entry-Fea&s;t, which he made for the cheif of the City; and knowing I wanted a Mule, he &s;ent me one well worth a hundred Crowns. This is the Noble&s;t Carriage in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which the great Per&s;onages choo&s;e before Hor&s;es, e&s;pecially when they are in years. But it was not the <HI>Kan</HI> alone who was civil to me. A young Lord, who liv'd in <HI>Kerman,</HI> and was at the Fea&s;t, who&s;e Father had been formerly <HI>Kan</HI> him&s;elf, took great delight to di&s;cour&s;e with me concerning my Travels; and offer'd me his &s;ervice in a very obliging man|ner. Now the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are very curious, and great admirers of the Rarities of Forein Countries: which inclination led the young Lord to enquire of me whether I had any Fire-Arms, telling me he would content me for them to my &s;atisfaction. The next Morning I pre&s;ented him with a Carbine, and a pair of Pi&s;tols that pleas'd him exceedingly; and a little Watch, for which I would take no Money, whereat he &s;eem'd to be not a little troubl'd. However he &s;ent me a &s;tately Hor&s;e worth about two hundred Crowns, or twelve <HI>Tomans.</HI> This young Lord was of a clear humour, civil, accompli&s;h'd, generous, and did every thing with a good grace. So that when he &s;ent me the Hor&s;e, he &s;ent to entreat me withal, if I did not like that Hor&s;e, to come and choo&s;e which I lik'd be&s;t in his Stable.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="33">
By the favour of this Lord and the <HI>Kan,</HI> I made good the Purcha&s;e that I intended. For the People began to murmur (knowing what a Parcel I had got together) and told the <HI>Kan</HI> that I would carry away all the Cloth out of the Country, &s;o that they &s;hould have none to &s;et the Poor on work. Thereupon the <HI>Kan</HI> &s;ent for me, and for tho&s;e rea&s;ons told me I mu&s;t buy no more. To &s;end off the blow, I made an&s;wer, That it was the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s de&s;ire to try if we could make as fine Cloth of his Wool in <HI>France,</HI> as they did in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and that if-it &s;ucceeded, I &s;hould bring <HI>French</HI> Workmen into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;o by &s;ettling the Trade in his own Country, free him from the Charge of forein Manufacturers. This &s;ilenc'd the <HI>Kan,</HI> &s;o that I &s;till bargain'd for more. But when I was return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the People of the Country would not keep touch with me. However, I wrote &s;o home to the <HI>Kan,</HI> threatning withal to complain to the King, that he fearing the King's di&s;|plea&s;ure, forc'd the Natives to &s;end me my Bargain to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Road from <HI>Kerman</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> and the Fortune of <HI>Nazar Mahomet-Ali-Beg.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Kerman</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is no le&s;s than five and twenty days on Hor&s;eback. In tho&s;e places where there is any Water, the Conntry is very good; but tho&s;e places are very rare; for the Road is generally Sandy, and offen&s;ive to the Eyes. The Chiefe&s;t comfort to a Fraveller is, that every Evening he meets with an Inn, where there are Ci&s;terns, which is a great refre&s;hment in tho&s;e de&s;ert Countries. The mo&s;t part of tho&s;e Inns were built &s;ome Years &s;ince by the &s;pecial care of <HI>Mahomet-Ali-Beg Nazar,</HI> or Grand Ma&s;ter of the King's Hou&s;e and Trea&s;ury; a Per&s;on the mo&s;t Virtuous of any that <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> can boa&s;t of for many Years. He was Generous, and favour'd the <HI>Franks</HI> in all things, for he lov'd them exceedingly. He faithfully &s;erv'd his King, and defended the People again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion and In&s;olencies of the Great ones; which drew upon him the hatred of many: but &s;till he pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf by his &s;yncerity and prudence; as by the following Story will remarkably appear.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the Fir&s;t, being one day a Hunting in the Mountains far out of &s;ight from his followers, met a young Lad playing upon a Pipe by an Herd of Goats. The King asking him &s;ome Que&s;tions, he an&s;wer'd him to the purpo&s;e to every one, not knowing who he was. The King &s;urpriz'd at his Repartees, made a &s;ign to <HI>Iman-couli-Kan</HI> Governour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> who was ju&s;t come up to him, not to tell the Goat-herd who he was. After that he proceeded to ask him other Que|&s;tions; to which the young man an&s;wer'd &s;o &s;martly, that the King could not choo&s;e but &s;tand in an amaze. Thereupon the King ask'd the <HI>Kan</HI> what he thought of the Goat-herds Wit? Who an&s;wer'd, that he believ'd if the Boy were taught to Write and Read, he might do good &s;ervice to his Maje&s;ty. Upon that the King immediately caus'd him to be &s;ent to School, where the young Lad being naturally of a &s;olid Wit, clear Judgment, and happy Memory, grew &s;o accompli&s;h'd, and &s;o well acquitted him&s;elf of &s;everal Employments which his Maje&s;ty be&s;tow'd upon him, that the King advanc'd him to the Office of <HI>Nazar,</HI> or Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and did him the honour to call him <HI>Mahomet-Ali-Beg.</HI> The King ob|&s;erving his fidelity, and good management of all things, &s;ent him twice Amba&s;&s;ador to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and both times was extreamly pleas'd with his Negotiation. <HI>Ma|homet</HI> lov'd Ju&s;tice, and would not &s;toop to be corrupted by Pre&s;ents: A thing which is very rare among the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> This great Integrity of his made all the Lords of the Court his Enemies, e&s;pecially the Eunuchs and the Women, who have always the King's Ear. But while <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> liv'd, there was no per&s;on that dur&s;t open his lips again&s;t the <HI>Nazar,</HI> &s;o much was he in favour, and that ju&s;tly, with the King. <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> &s;ucceeding his Grandfather <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> and being very young, the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Adver&s;aries thought they had now a fair Game to play. Thereupon the
<PB N="43" REF="33">
Eunuchs, who are always at the King's Ear, &s;ugge&s;ted to him many things to the di&s;advantage of the Grand Ma&s;ter; but whatever they &s;aid, the King gave little heed to their Tales. At length, one day when the King was looking upon certain Skains and Daggers &s;et with precious Stones, one of the Eunuchs told him tho&s;e were trifles, and then de&s;ir'd his Maje&s;ty to &s;end for a Scimeter that the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> had &s;ent <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> all over &s;et with Diamonds. True it is, that the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> had &s;ent a rich Scimiter to<HI>Sha-Abas;</HI> but <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> had defac'd it long before <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s time, and had made a noble Jewel of the Stones that adorn'd it. There|upon this Scimitar was &s;ought for in the Trea&s;ury, where <HI>Mahomet</HI> was chief Offi|cer; but not being to be found, the King was troubl'd, finding it regi&s;tred in the Book of Pre&s;ents. Then certain Eunuchs and Grandees of the Court took their opportunity to rip up <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Life; they repre&s;ented to the King how many Inns, Bridges, and Dikes <HI>Mahomet</HI> had built at his own charge; what a Hou&s;e he had rear'd for him&s;elf, fitting for his Maje&s;ty to live in: and aggravated withal, that he could not do &s;uch great things as tho&s;e, without purloining notably from the Publick Stock; for which he &s;hould do well to call him to an account. As they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing, <HI>Mahomet</HI> came into the Pre&s;ence, to whom the King (not receiving him as he was wont to do) &s;poke &s;ome hard words about the Scimiter that could not be found: telling him withal, that he would &s;ee if the all re&s;t of the things in the Trea&s;ury were agreeable to the Regi&s;ter, and then gave him fifteen days time to give in his Account. <HI>Mahomet</HI> not at all mov'd, reply'd to the King, that if his Maje&s;ty pleas'd he might come to the Trea&s;ury to morrow: and withal be|&s;ought him &s;o to do, though the King a &s;econd time gave him fifteen days. There|upon the King did go to the Trea&s;ury next morning, according to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s de&s;ire, and found all things in good order; having heard before what became of the Sci|miter. From thence he went to <HI>Mahomet</HI> s Hou&s;e, who made the King a mean Pre&s;ent: For it is the cu&s;tom, that he whom the King honours with a Vi&s;it, mu&s;t make a Pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty. After the King had receiv'd it, he walk'd up and down, and viewed the Chambers, Halls, Parlours and Rooms of State; and wonder'd to &s;ee them &s;o ill &s;et out with plain Felts, and cour&s;e Carpets; whereas in other Lords Hou&s;es a man could not &s;et his Foot upon any thing but Cloth of Gold and Silk. For the King, as they had &s;et the <HI>Nazar</HI> out, expected to have found other things; which made him admire at &s;o great a Moderation in &s;o high a degree of Honour. Now at the end of a Gallery, there was a Door lockt with three great Padlocks. Of this the King took no notice: whereupon the <HI>Meter,</HI> who is the White Eunuch, and chief of his Chamber, as he came back, &s;hew'd the King the Door that was &s;o &s;trongly Padlock'd; which made the King &s;o curious to have it open'd: withal, asking <HI>Mahomet</HI> what he had got there lock'd up with &s;o much care? Oh Sir, &s;aid he, it behoves me to keep that lockt, for there is all the E&s;tate I have in the World. All that your Maje&s;ty has &s;een in this Hou&s;e is yours, but all that is in that Chamber is mine, and I dare a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, your Maje&s;ty will be &s;o gaacious as never to take it from me. Tho&s;e words inflam'd the King's curio&s;ity &s;o, that he commanded the Door to be open'd: But he was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd, when he &s;aw nothing more within than <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Sheep-hook, that lay upon two Nails, his Scrip wherein he us'd to put his Victuals, his Bottle for his Water, his Pipe, and his Shepherd's Weeds, all hanging again&s;t the Wall. The <HI>Nazar</HI> beholding the King's a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;uch a Sight, Sir, &s;aid he, when the King <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound me in the Mountain keeping Goats, then that was all I had, and he took nothing from me: I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty that you would not deprive me of the&s;e things neither; but rather, if you plea&s;e, let me re&s;ume them again, and fall to my old calling. The Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> touch'd at &s;o high a piece of Virtue, caus'd him&s;elf to be di&s;apparel'd, and gave his Habit to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> which is the greate&s;t Honour that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> can be&s;tow upon a Subject. Thus <HI>Mahomet</HI> continu'd and dy'd honourably in his Employment. This brave Per&s;on was the Protector of all the <HI>Franks</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> and if any one had done them wrong, upon complaint he did them Ju&s;tice immediately. One day as I was &s;hooting Ducks, upon the River of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> near the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Gardens, with two Servants, &s;ome of the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s people that did not know me &s;et upon me, and would have taken away my Gun; which I would not let go till I had broke the Stock about the Shoulders of the one, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ung the Barrel at the other's Head. Thereupon I took &s;ome of the <HI>Franks</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="34">
along with me, and complain'd to the <HI>Nazar:</HI> He te&s;tifi'd his &s;orrow for what had happen'd, and gave us evident Proofs thereof, by the blows which he caus'd to be laid upon tho&s;e that had done me the injury.</P>
<P>Another time, <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> being upon his return from <HI>Guilan,</HI> his Tents were &s;et up near <HI>Zulfa</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> where the King &s;taid to hunt two or three days. Now among the re&s;t of the Courtizans that follow'd the Court, to diverti&s;e the King with Dancing and Mummery, there was one who was perfectly hand&s;om, to whom the King had already &s;ent Pre&s;ents; which could not be unknown to any Lord i'the Court. But the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Son, for all that, being in the heat of Youth, got this Courtizan to his Tent, and there lay with her: which came to his Father's Ears next day. The <HI>Nazar,</HI> whether out of his zeal to the King, or whether it were an effect of his prudence to prevent the King's anger, which would have certain|ly been the death of his Son, caus'd him to be drub'd, after the manner of the Coun|try, and ba&s;tinado'd all over, till the Nails of his Toes dropt off, and that his Body was almo&s;t a perfect Gelly. Which when the King under&s;tood, together with the Young Man's Crime, he &s;aid no more, but that the <HI>Nazar</HI> had done wi&s;ely by puni&s;hing his Son him&s;elf, to prevent his Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But to return to the Road from <HI>Kerman</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The fir&s;t day that I &s;et out from <HI>Kerman,</HI> at my Stage in the Evening I met with a rich <HI>Moullah,</HI> who &s;eeing I had Wine, civilly offer'd me &s;ome of his Ice to cool it. In retaliation, I gave him &s;ome of my Bottle. He invited me to his Hou&s;e, which was well built, with a hand&s;om Garden with Water in it. He entertain'd me with Spoon-meat, according to the mode of the Country; and when I took my leave, he fill'd my <HI>Baracho</HI> with very good Wine.</P>
<P>The following days I &s;aw nothing worthy ob&s;ervation; the Country being as I have already de&s;crib'd it.</P>
<P><HI>Yezd</HI> lyes in the Road, almo&s;t in the mid-way between <HI>Kerman</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> in 93 Deg. 15 Min. of Longitude, and 13 Deg. 45 Min. of Latitude. It is a great Town in the middle of the Sands, that extend them&s;elves for two Leagues round it: &s;o that when you leave <HI>Yezd</HI> you mu&s;t take a Guide, for upon the lea&s;t Wind the Sand covers the Highway, whereby a man may be apt to fall into Holes, which &s;eem to have been either old Ci&s;terns, or the Ruines of ancient Buildings. Between the Town and the Sands there is a little good Soil, which produces excellent Fruits, but above all, Melons of &s;everal &s;orts: the Pulp of &s;ome is green, of others yellow and vermilion; and &s;ome there are, the meat whereof is as hard as a Renneting. There are al&s;o very good&punc; Grapes, and good Wine; but the Governour will not permit the Inhabitants to make Wine. Some therefore they dry, and of the re&s;t they make a kind of Confection to eat with Bread. There are al&s;o abundance of Figs, which are large and well ta&s;ted. They di&s;til va&s;t quantities of Ro&s;e-water, and another &s;ort of Water with which they dye their Hands and Nails red, which they &s;queeze out of a certain Root call'd <HI>Hina.</HI> There are three Inns i'th&punc; City, and &s;everal <HI>Bazars</HI> or Market-places cover'd and vaulted, which are full of Mer|chants and Workmens Ware-hou&s;es. They al&s;o make at <HI>Yezd</HI> &s;everal Stuffs of Silk intermix'd with Gold and Silver, which they call <HI>Zerba&s;te;</HI> and another &s;ort of Stuff of all pure Silk, call'd <HI>Dara&iuml;,</HI> like our &s;mooth &s;trip'd Taffata's. Other Stuffs they made, half Silk half Cotton; others all of Cotton, like our Fu&s;tians. They make al&s;o Serges of a particular Wool, which is &s;o fine and delicate, that it looks hand|&s;omer, and is much better than Silk.</P>
<P>Though I had nothing to do, I &s;taid in <HI>Yezd</HI> three days, becau&s;e I met with &s;ome <HI>Armenians</HI> of my acquaintance. In which time I found the general Opinion to be true. For certainly the Women of <HI>Yezd</HI> are the hand&s;ome&s;t Women in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> There is no Fea&s;t made, but five or &s;ix of them come to diverti&s;e the Gue&s;ts with Dancing, who are generally none of the meane&s;t Beauties and Conver&s;ations among them. However it comes to pa&s;s, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Proverb is, <HI>That to live happy, a Man mu&s;t have a Wi&s;e of</HI> Yezd, <HI>eat the Bread of</HI> Yezdecas, <HI>and drink the Wine of</HI> Schiras.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the <HI>Caravan&s;era's,</HI> and Government of the <HI>Caravans.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Caravan&s;era's</HI> are the Ea&s;tern Inns, far different from ours; for they are neither &s;o convenient, nor &s;o hand&s;om. They are built &s;quare, much like Cloy&s;ters, being u&s;ually but one Story high; for it is rare to &s;ee one of two Stories, A wide Gate brings you into the Court; and in the mid&s;t of the Building, in the front, and upon the right and le&s;t hand, there is a Hall for Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality to keep together. On each &s;ide of the Hall are Lodgings for every man by him&s;elf. The&s;e Lodgings are rais'd all along the Court two or three Steps high, ju&s;t behind which are the Stables, where many times it is as good lying as in the Chamber. Some will rather lye there in the Winter, becau&s;e they are warm, and are roof'd as well as the Chambers. Right again&s;t the Head of every Hor&s;e there is a Nich with a Window into the Lodging-Chamber, out of which every man may &s;ee how his Hor&s;e is look'd after. The&s;e Niches are u&s;ually &s;o large, that three men may lye in them; and there it is that the Servants u&s;ually dre&s;s their Victuals.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of Inns. For &s;ome are endow'd; where you may be re|ceiv'd for Charities &s;ake; others, where you mu&s;t pay for what you call for. There are none of the fir&s;t, but between <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Nor is it lawful for any others to build &s;uch, but only the Mothers and Si&s;ters of the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> or &s;uch <HI>Viziers,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> as have been three times in Battel again&s;t the Chri&s;tians. In the&s;e Inns, which are built out of Legacies, there is a very good allowance of Diet to Travellers&punc; and at your departure you have nothing to do but to thank the Benefactor. But from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there are none of tho&s;e endow'd Inns; only &s;uch where you have nothing but bare Walls. It is for you to provide Uten&s;ils for your Kitchin, and a Bed to lye on: as for Provi&s;ion, the people bring Lambs, Pullets, Butter, and Fruits in their &s;ea&s;ons: or el&s;e you may buy it, provided before-hand by the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e. There you al&s;o meet with Barley and Straw for the Hor&s;es, unle&s;s it be in &s;ome few places that I have been at upon the Road. In the Country you pay nothing for your Chambers; but in the Cities you pay &s;omething, though it be but a &s;mall matter. U&s;ually the <HI>Caravans</HI> never go into the Towns, which are not able to contain &s;o many People and Hor&s;es. When you come to your Quarters every one looks after his own Chamber, for there is no regard to Poor or Rich: &s;ometimes out of Breeding, or out of Intere&s;t, an ordinary Trade&s;man will give way to a great Merchant; but no man is permitted to leave the Chamber which he has once made choice of. In the night the Inn-keeper &s;huts up his Gates, being an&s;werable for all things that &s;hall be lo&s;t; for which rea&s;on he keeps a Guard about the Inn.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Per&s;ian Caravan&s;era's,</HI> they are more commodious, and better built than tho&s;e of <HI>Turkie,</HI> and at more rea&s;onable di&s;tances, throughout almo&s;t all the Country. By which de&s;cription of Inns it is ea&s;ie to ob&s;erve, that though the&s;e <HI>Caravan&s;era's</HI> are not &s;o commodious for the Rich as our <HI>European</HI> Inns, yet they are more convenient for the Poor, to whom they never refu&s;e to give admittance: no per&s;on being oblig'd to eat or drink more than he plea&s;es; but every one being allow'd to &s;pend according to his Stock, without grumbling.</P>
<P>You may travel in <HI>Turkie</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> either with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> or el&s;e in company, ten or twelve together, or el&s;e alone with a Guide. The &s;afe&s;t way is to go with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> though you are longer upon the Road, by rea&s;on of the &s;lowne&s;s of their march, e&s;pecially when the <HI>Caravans</HI> con&s;i&s;t of Camels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravans</HI> are as it were great Convoys, which con&s;i&s;t of a good number of Merchants, that meet at certain times and places, to put them&s;elves into a con|dition to defend them&s;elves from Thieves, that are very ri&s;e in Troops in &s;everal de&s;ert places upon the Road. The&s;e Merchants choo&s;e among them&s;elves a <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who orders them how they &s;hall march, a&s;&s;igns the places of lodging at night, and who with the chief of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> is a kind of Judge of the differences that
<PB N="46" REF="35">
fall out by the way. There is no hone&s;t man that covets the employment; for the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi,</HI> being to di&s;charge &s;everal &s;mall duties upon the Road, however he behave him&s;elf, is &s;till &s;u&s;pected for his fidelity. When the <HI>Turks</HI> are mo&s;t nume|rous, they make choice of a <HI>Turk;</HI> when the <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants are mo&s;t, they choo&s;e an <HI>Armenian.</HI></P>
<P>There are two forts of <HI>Caravans.</HI> There are <HI>Caravans</HI> which con&s;i&s;t of Camels, which are the mo&s;t u&s;ual; in regard that Camels are cheap, and for that &s;ome Camels will carry as much as three Hor&s;es, others as much as four or five. But among the <HI>Caravans</HI> of Camels, there are &s;everal Hor&s;es and Mules, which the Merchants them&s;elves ride upon; it being very tedious to ride upon a Camel when he only goes a foot-pace, but very plea&s;ant when he goes upon his large trot. There are other <HI>Caravans</HI> that con&s;i&s;t only of Hor&s;es; and among the&s;e, if the Merchant have none of his own, he may hire one. The Servants ride upon tho&s;e Hor&s;es that are lea&s;t laden; but at <HI>Smyrna</HI> you may meet with &s;everal good Hor&s;es very cheap, from thirty to &s;ixty Crowns. As for tho&s;e per&s;ons that are either unwilling or unable to be at any expence, they make u&s;e of A&s;&s;es, of which there are enow to be had. Above all things, you mu&s;t take care to provide Pack-Hor&s;es to carry your Wine; for the Camel-Ma&s;ters being <HI>Mahometans,</HI> will not permit you to lade their Camels with any &s;uch Liquor; that Bea&s;t being particularly con&s;ecrated to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who &s;o &s;trictly forbad the u&s;e of Wine. You put your Wine in Bottles made of wild Goats Skins, with the hairy &s;ide turn'd innermo&s;t, and well pitch'd within. There are &s;ome of the&s;e Bottles from which they take off the Hair; but they are not &s;o good, as being &s;eldom without holes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Camel-Ma&s;ters are an in&s;olent &s;ort of people, which you &s;hall never know how to deal with, unle&s;s you can bring them to puni&s;hment. There was one that play'd me &s;ome of his jades tricks in the Road from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Tauris;</HI> but when I came to <HI>E&s;crivan,</HI> I complain'd to the <HI>Kan,</HI> who pre&s;ently caus'd a hundred Ba&s;tinado's to be giv'n him upon the &s;pot. Nor is there any other way to bring tho&s;e Scoundrels to rea&s;on, e&s;pecially at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and &s;uch other places, where the Merchants have their <HI>Con&s;uls,</HI> who upon the lea&s;t complaint to the <HI>Cady</HI> have Ju&s;tice done them imme|diately. The examples of &s;ome of the&s;e Camel-drivers that have been paid off, keep the re&s;t in good <HI>decorum;</HI> and they will be very tractable for a good while after.</P>
<P>The Journies of the <HI>Caravans</HI> are not equal; &s;ometimes not above &s;ix hours travel, &s;ometimes ten, and &s;ometimes twelve; it being the convenience of Water, which is not every where to be met with, that is the Rule of Lodging the <HI>Caravan.</HI> At all times the <HI>Caravan</HI> travels more by night than by day; in Summer to avoid the heat, and at other times, that you may be &s;ure to have day enough to &s;et up your Tents. For if the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;hould come to pitch in the night, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to find where to &s;et up their Tents, to dre&s;s and look after their Bea&s;ts, make ready their Kitchins, and provide things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o large a Company. True it is, that in the depth of Winter and in the great Snows, they &s;eldom &s;et out till two or three hours after midnight; and that &s;ometimes they &s;tay till day-break. But in Summer, according to the Journey which they intend, they &s;et out either at midnight, or an hour after Sun-&s;et. The la&s;t time I went from <HI>Smyrna</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix hundred Camels, and almo&s;t the &s;ame number of Hor&s;e. Sometimes their number is greater, &s;o that the Camels going but by one and one after another, a <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;eems to be an Army; and whether it be in travelling or lodging, they take up a world of Ground. Now by rea&s;on they travel all night in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> it happens that the Air is indifferent whol&s;om; and that the Travellers, that lye for the mo&s;t part upon a Carpet &s;pread upon the Ground, find them&s;elves very little inconve|nienc'd by it.</P>
<P>The Camels that go into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> through the Northern Provinces of <HI>Turkie,</HI> travel like Hor&s;es in a Cart, by &s;even and &s;even; they are ty'd together by a Cord about the bigne&s;s of a Man's little Finger, and a Fathom long; fa&s;ten'd to the Pack|&s;addle of the Camel that goes before, and to the Head-harne&s;s of the Camel that follows. Tho&s;e little Cords are made no &s;tronger, to the end that if the Camel before &s;hould chance to fall into any hole, the Camel behind &s;hould either keep him up, or el&s;e not be pull'd in after the other. And to the end that the Camel-driver who leads the foremo&s;t, may know whether the other &s;ix follow him or no, the la&s;t Camel has a Bell about his Neck, which if it cea&s;e to ring, 'tis a &s;ign that
<PB N="47" REF="35">
&s;ome one of the &s;mall Cords is broken, and that a Camel has got a mi&s;chance. The &s;eventh Camel generally carries the Provi&s;ions. For if a Merchant have &s;ix Camels laden, he is generally allow'd one to carry his Provi&s;ion; if he have but three, he is allow'd but half a Camel's load; but if he have nine or twelve, he pays nothing for the carriage of his Provi&s;ions of Food, or any thing el&s;e that he plea&s;es. Every Merchant with his Servants rides by the Camels that are laden with his Goods, e&s;pecially in the dark nights; for there are a &s;ubtil &s;ort of Thieves, that have a trick to cut the two Cords behind and before, and without any noi&s;e drive the Ca|mel out of the way; for having no Hoofs, his Feet cannot be &s;hod, and con&s;equently he makes no noi&s;e. As well Merchants, as others, Camel-drivers and Servants, keep them&s;elves from &s;leeping &s;ometimes by &s;inging, and &s;ometimes by taking To|bacco, and &s;ometimes by di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravan</HI> lyes in &s;uch places as they think mo&s;t convenient, chiefly near to the Water-&s;ide. When the Sun is &s;et, the <HI>Shaoux,</HI> who are a &s;ort of poor people, are diligent to guard the whole Field, and take care of the Goods. They walk up and down, and either in the <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI> Dialect they cry one to another, <HI>God is one, and he is merciful;</HI> adding from time to time, <HI>Have a care of your &s;elf.</HI> When they &s;ee that the time grows near to &s;et out, they give notice to the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who gives order to bid them cry, <HI>Saddle your Hor&s;es;</HI> and after that, to cry again, <HI>Load.</HI> And it is a &s;trange thing to con&s;ider, that upon the &s;econd Cry of the <HI>Shaoux</HI> every thing is ready upon an in&s;tant, and the <HI>Caravan</HI> begins to &s;et for|ward in great order and great &s;ilence. Every one takes care to be ready, for it is dangerous to be left behind, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Countries which are haunted with Thieves.

<P>When the Stages are long, and that they believe that they &s;hall not get thither by ten or twelve in the morning, every one carries two &s;mall Wallets on each &s;ide his Hor&s;e, and when they come to the place where they intend to Break-fa&s;t, they &s;pread a Carpet upon the Ground and fall to.</P>
<P>When you go from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> or <HI>Aleppo</HI> with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> it be|hoves all people to carry them&s;elves according to the mode of the Country; in <HI>Turkie</HI> like a <HI>Turk,</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as a <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> el&s;e would they be accounted ridiculous, nay &s;ometimes they would hardly be permitted to pa&s;s in &s;ome places, where the lea&s;t mi&s;carriage makes the Governours jealous, who are ea&s;ily per&s;waded to take Strangers for Spies. Always, if you have upon the Road but an <HI>Arabian</HI> Ve&s;t, with a mean Girdle, whatever Clothes you wear under, there is no danger of pa&s;&s;ing any where. If you wear a Turbant, you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;have off your Hair, el&s;e it will never &s;tay upon the Head. As for Beards, they never mind them in <HI>Turkie,</HI> the greate&s;t being accounted the hand&s;ome&s;t; but in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they &s;have their Chins, and wear their Mu&s;taches: and I remember I have &s;een one of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Porters, who&s;e Mu&s;taches were &s;o long, that he could tye them behind his neck, for which rea&s;on he had a double Pen&s;ion. More than that, you mu&s;t provide your &s;elf of Boots according to the cu&s;tom of the Country: they are made of red, yellow, or black Cordovan, lin'd with Linen cloth; and in regard they never reach higher than the Knee, they are as convenient to travel in as Shooes. As for Spurs, they never wear any; for the Iron at the upper end of the Stirrop, which is four-&s;quare, &s;erves to &s;pur the Hor&s;e: &s;o much the better, becau&s;e it is the cu&s;tom of all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to ride very &s;hort.</P>
<P>Before you &s;et out, you mu&s;t provide your &s;elf of &s;everal Hou&s;hold-Goods, e&s;pe|cially of tho&s;e Bottles that are call'd <HI>Matares,</HI> which are made of <HI>Bulgary</HI>-Leather; every man carries his own at the Pummel of his Saddle, or el&s;e fa&s;ten'd to the Crupper of the Saddle behind. Be&s;ides the&s;e you mu&s;t buy <HI>Borracho's;</HI> the mo&s;t &s;erviceable things in the World; for they will never break, and will hold above fifty Pints at a time. The &s;maller Bottles &s;erve to put <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> in: and the Leather whereof they are made, has that peculiar to it &s;elf, that it keeps the Water fre&s;h. Then you mu&s;t provide Food, and make a provi&s;ion of Rice and Bisket as far as <HI>Tocat:</HI> For as for Pullets, Eggs, and &s;uch like things, you meet with them almo&s;t every where; as al&s;o with Provi&s;ion for your. Hor&s;es, and new Bread, unle&s;s in &s;ome few places. You mu&s;t al&s;o carry a Tent with all its appurtenances, with a Mat|tre&s;s; and Clothes to cover the Hor&s;es at night, e&s;pecially in the time of the
<PB N="48" REF="36">
deep Snows, wherein you &s;hall find them almo&s;t buried the next mor|ning.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caravan</HI> comes near the place where it intends to &s;top, every Mer|chant rides before to take up a convenient place for him&s;elf and his Goods, for which he covets a ri&s;ing Ground, that if it &s;hould happen to rain, the Water may run from the Bales. They al&s;o in that ca&s;e lay Stones under the Bales, and a Cloth over them; and the Servants make a Ditch about the Tent for the Water to run into. But if it be fair weather, there is no care tak'n to &s;et up the Tent: or if it be, 'tis folded up after Supper; to the end the Owners may have the more liberty to look about them, and may be in a better condition to look after the Thieves. But if there be any likelihood of foul weather, the Tent is let &s;tand till the fir&s;t Cry of the <HI>Shaoux.</HI> The Hor&s;es are ty'd before the&punc; Tent with Cords fa&s;ten'd to a Nail, and their hinder Legs are ty'd with other Cords, to the end they may not &s;tir out of their places. If it be not &s;ea&s;onable for them to eat Gra&s;s, you mu&s;t buy Barley, and Straw of the Country-men that come to &s;erve the <HI>Caravan,</HI> their being no Oats neither in <HI>Turkis</HI> nor <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>In dre&s;&s;ing your Victuals, you mu&s;t follow the cu&s;tom of the Country; which is, to make a Hole in the Ground, and then kindling a Fire in it, to &s;et the Pot over it.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t inconvenience which Trevellers &s;uffer with the <HI>Caravans</HI> is this, that when they come&punc; Waters, which are only Wells, or Ci&s;terns, or Springs, where only two or three lade up Water at a time. For after&punc; the <HI>Caravan</HI> is lodg'd, the Merchants &s;hall be forc'd to &s;tay for Water two or three hours together; for they that belong to the Bea&s;ts of Carriage, will not &s;uffer any per&s;on to take any Water, till the Camels, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Mules are all &s;erv'd. Nor is there any contending with the&s;e Camel-drivers and Muleters; for as they are a rude &s;ort of people, a Man runs the hazard of his Life by conte&s;ting alone: of which one Example may &s;uffice for all.</P>
<P>Setting out one day from <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> with a Merchant of <HI>Babylon,</HI> as we came to the Inn where we lay the fir&s;t night, which was call'd <HI>Guetchy&punc;</HI> the Merchant commanded one of his Slaves who was a <HI>Cafer</HI> of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> to fetch him &s;ome fre&s;h Water at the Ci&s;tern, to drink: The <HI>Cafer</HI> went thither, and return'd without any Water, telling his Ma&s;ter, that the Camel-drivers and Mu|leters threaten'd to beat him, and would not let him come near the Ci&s;tern. The Merchant either ill advis'd, or not knowing the cu&s;tom, bid him go back, and kick tho&s;e that refus'd him. Whereupon the <HI>Cafer</HI> returning, and finding the &s;ame re&s;i&s;tance as before, began to give ill language to the Camel-drivers, &s;o that one of them happen'd to &s;trike him. Upon that the <HI>Cafer</HI> drawing his Sword, ran him into the Belly, &s;o that he fell down dead: Thereupon the whole Rabble fell upon him, bound him, and carry'd him back to <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i</HI> for the Governour to put him to death. The Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Cafer,</HI> accompany'd by &s;everal Merchants, went to the Governour and repre&s;ented to him the in&s;olence of tho&s;e people, and how the bu&s;ine&s;s had happen'd. Upon which the Governour took the poor fellow out of their hands, and caus'd him to be kept &s;afe; after that, he caus'd ten or a dozen of tho&s;e Muleters to be &s;eiz'd, and orderd'd them to be &s;oundly ba&s;tinado'd, for hindring a Merchant's Servant from fetching Water for his Ma&s;ter. He al&s;o put others in Pri&s;on; who had not been releas'd &s;o &s;oon, but at the reque&s;t of tho&s;e Merchants who&s;e Goods they carry'd, and who &s;tood in need of their &s;ervice. The Governour&punc; &s;pun out the bu&s;ine&s;s, on purpo&s;e that the re&s;t might be gone: but as &s;oon as they were all departed except the two Brothers of the party &s;lain, he told them, he could not do them Ju&s;tice, becau&s;e their Brother belong'd to <HI>Schiras;</HI> &s;o that all that he could do, was to &s;end the Criminal thither. The Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Cafer</HI> being rich, and loving the Slave, made ha&s;t to <HI>Schiras,</HI> to tell his Story fir&s;t to the <HI>Kan.</HI> And I remember, two days jourey yon this &s;ide <HI>Schiras</HI> we met in the High way abundance of poor people, the kindred of the party &s;lain, who were &s;taying for the <HI>Cafer,</HI> to carry him before the <HI>Kan,</HI> and to demand Ju&s;tice. Two o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> three Leagues al&s;o from <HI>Schiras</HI> I met the Father and Mother, together with the Wife and Children of the deceas'd, who &s;eeing me pa&s;s along, fell at my Feet and recounted to me their Grievances. I told them by my <HI>Kalmachi,</HI> that their be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way was to take a piece of Money of the <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, and &s;o to put up

This Propo&s;al, that would have been accepted in Chri&s;tendom, was rejected by tho&s;e poor <HI>Mahometans;</HI> in &s;o much that the Father tore his Beard, and the Women their Hair, crying out, That if it were the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Franks</HI> to &s;eil the Blood of their Kindred, it was not their cu&s;tom &s;o to do. When the re&s;t of the kindred came with the <HI>Cafer</HI> to <HI>Schiras,</HI> the <HI>Kan</HI> did all he could to per&s;uade the Widow to take Money; but not being able to over-rule her, he was forc'd to give the <HI>Cafer</HI> into their hands: and how they us'd him I cannot tell, being con|&s;train'd at the &s;ame time to pais from <HI>Schiras</HI> for <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the breeding, nature, and &s;everal &s;orts of Camels.</HEAD>
<P>THE Female Camel bears her Burthen eleven Months; and her Milk is a &s;overeign Remedy again&s;t the Drop&s;ie. You mu&s;t drink a Pint of it every Day for three Weeks together: and I have &s;een &s;everal Cures wrought thereby at <HI>Bal&s;ara, Ormus,</HI> and in other places in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, upon &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Mariners.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as a Camel comes into the World, they &s;old his Feet under his Belly, and make him lye upon them; after that they cover his Back with a Carpet that hangs to the Ground, laying Stones upon each &s;ide&punc; &s;o that he may not be able to ri&s;e; and thus they leave him for fifteen or twenty days. In the mean time they give him Milk to drink, but not very often; to the end he may be accu&s;tom'd to drink little. This they do al&s;o to u&s;e them to lye down, when they go about to Lade them; at which time they will fold their Legs and lye down &s;o obediently, that it is an admirable thing to con&s;ider. So &s;oon as the <HI>Caravan</HI> comes to the place where it is to lye, all the Camels that belong to one Ma&s;ter will range them&s;elves in a Circle, and lye down upon their fore Feet; &s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is but untying one Cord that holds the Bales, and they will &s;lide off gently from each &s;ide of the Camel. When 'tis time to lade again, the &s;ame Camel comes and crouches down between the two Burthens, and when they are fa&s;ten'd, gently ri&s;es up with the Burthen again; which is done without any trouble or noi&s;e. When the Camels are unladen, they let them go a|field to feed upon the Heath and Bu&s;hes, and half an hour before Sun &s;et they return of them&s;elves, unle&s;s any one happen to wander, which they will call again with a certain Cry which is natural to them. When they return, they range them&s;elves in a Circle, and the Muleters give to every one little Balls of Barley|meal kneaded, as big as two Fi&s;ts. The Camel though he be of a large bulk, eats very little, contented with what he meets with upon the Heaths; where he more e&s;pecially looks for Thi&s;tles, of which he is a great lover. But it is more admi|rable to con&s;ider with what patience they&punc; endure drowth: For one time that I cro&s;s'd over the De&s;erts, where we were 65 days upon the Road, our Camels were nine days without Drink. But what is more wonderful is this, that when the Ca|mel is in the heat of Generation, he neither eats nor drinks for 40 days together; and he is then &s;o furious, that without great care you cannot avoid being bitten by him: And whereever he bites, he carries away a piece of the Fle&s;h. At that time i&s;&s;ues out of their Mouths a white Foam, be&s;ides that there appears on each &s;ide of their Chops two Bladders large and &s;well'd, like the Bladder of a Boar.</P>
<P>In the Spring time all the Camel's Hair falls off in three days. The Skin remains bare, and then the Flies are very trouble&s;om. There is no way but to Tar them all over&punc; though it be a ventrous thing to come near them at that time.</P>
<P>A Camel mu&s;t be dre&s;t as well as a Hor&s;e; but the Camel keeper never u&s;es any Curry-comb, but only beats him all over with a &s;mall Wand, as Carpets are wont to be du&s;ted. If a Camel be hurt or gall'd under the Pack&punc; &s;addle, they never apply any thing to it, but only wa&s;h it well with Urine, without u&s;ing any other Re|medy.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="37">
There are two &s;orts of Camels; the one which is proper for hot Countries, the other for cold Countries.</P>
<P>The Camels in hot Countries, &s;uch as go from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>I&s;paehan,</HI> cannot travel if the Ground be dirty and &s;lippery; for their Belldies bur&s;t, while their hinder Quarters rive from their Bodies. The&s;e are &s;mall Camels, that carry not above five or &s;ix hundred Pound weight; but they are kept for little, and endure Thir&s;t a long time. They do not tye them Head to Tayl, as they do the great ones, but let them go as they plea&s;e them&s;elves, like a Herd of Cows. The Camel-driver follows them &s;inging, and &s;ometimes playing upon his Pipe: the louder he &s;ings and pipes, the fa&s;ter the Camels go; nay they will &s;tand &s;till when he gives over his Mu&s;ick. When the Camel-drivers come to a Heathy Ground, they will give them leave to &s;eed for half an hour, taking their Tabacco the while; and then &s;inging them together again, they &s;et forward. The Camels bred in the De&s;erts are hand&s;om, but very tender, &s;o that they mu&s;t be gently us'd, and never be put upon long Jour|nies. However, they eat and drink le&s;s than others, and endure thir&s;t more pa|tiently.</P>
<P>The Camels of cold Countries, &s;uch as tho&s;e that travel from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> are large Camels, that carry great Burthens, and will pull them&s;elves out of the dirt. But in fat Grounds and &s;lippery Ways the Drivers are fain to &s;pread Carpets, &s;ometimes an hundred one behind another; otherwi&s;e their hinder Quarters are al&s;o apt to rive from their Buttocks; but if the Road be &s;lippery for too great a di&s;tance together, there is no way but to tarry 'till it be dry'd up and fair. The&s;e Camels u&s;ually carry a thou&s;and Pound weight: but if the Merchant has any hank upon the Camel driver, he will lay upon every Camel fifteen hundred weight, thereby making two of three Burthens. This the Merchants do, when they come near the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es, e&s;pecially that of <HI>Erzerom,</HI> which is the mo&s;t &s;evere. The Merchant does this for his own Profit: So that when the Cu&s;tomer mi&s;tru&s;ting, de|mands how &s;o many Camels come to travel empty, he makes an&s;wer, that they were Camels that carry'd Provi&s;ion: But the Cu&s;tomer mo&s;t commonly winks at that good Husbandry of the Merchant, for fear of lo&s;ing his Cu&s;tom, and obliging the Merchant to take another Road.</P>
<P>There is as much knavery among the Camel drivers, as among our Hor&s;e-Cour&s;ers. For I remember, that being once at <HI>Casbin,</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant, thinking he had bought eight good Camels, was deceiv'd in four which he thought the be&s;t. He verily believing they had been fat and in good ca&s;e, but they were only blown up. For tho&s;e Cheats have a trick to cut a Hole near the Tail, of which the Purcha&s;er takes no notice, and which they know neatly how to &s;ow up again: In this Hole they will blow till they have pu&s;t up a lean Camel, that he &s;hall appear as fat and plump as the &s;ounde&s;t that ever fed: whereby they often deceive the quicke&s;t &s;ights, e&s;pecially when the Hair is all off, and that the bare Skin is all rub'd over with Tar.</P>

Merchant enters into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> whether it be at <HI>Erivan</HI> or <HI>Tauris,</HI> where the Money is coyn'd, he is oblig'd to tell what Silver he carry's, to the end it may be melted down and &s;tamp'd with the King's Stamp; under a great Penalty, if di&s;cover'd to be a concealer.

It behoves me now to treat of the Southern Provinces, and of tho&s;e through the De&s;erts, where there are &s;everal <HI>Emirs,</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, of which &s;everal are very potent: For there are &s;ome of them that can bring 30000 Hor&s;e into the Field, five of which I have had the honour to di&s;cour&s;e, and to oblige them with &s;mall Pre&s;ents; in recompence whereof they &s;ent me Rice, Mutton, Dates&punc; and Sherbet, as long as I &s;taid among them.</P>
<P>I embark'd at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in a <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that carry'd five and forty Guns, from thence we &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Malta.</HI> At <HI>Malta</HI> we &s;taid twelve days to carine the Ve&s;&s;el, and to take in fre&s;h Victuals. Among the re&s;t we bought two thou&s;and Quails, for there are a prodigious quantity in the I&s;land: but in two or three days we found five or &s;ix hundred of them de&s;troy'd by the Vermin that pe&s;ter'd the &s;hip.</P>
<P>From <HI>Malta</HI> we &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Larneca,</HI> a good Road in the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to the We&s;t of <HI>Famagofta,</HI> which is not above a days journey from it by Land. As we were making into the Road, about two or three hours after midnight, we perceiv'd a Ve&s;&s;el clo&s;e upon us, and both the Ships Company began to cry out, for fear of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lling foul one upon another; but the Ve&s;&s;el &s;heer'd clear without any harm on either &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="40">
In the morning we ca&s;t Anchor, and went-a&s;hear. It is a good half League from the Road where the Con&s;uls and Merchants, both <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> live in a very pitiful Village. However there is a little Mona&s;tery of <HI>Capuchins,</HI> who officiate in the Chapel of the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul; and another of Religious <HI>Italians,</HI> that depend upon the Guardian of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> We &s;taid but two days at <HI>Larneca;</HI> the Captain having nothing to do but to inform him&s;elf what bu&s;ine&s;s they might have for him at his return; it being u&s;ual then to take in &s;pun and un&s;pun Cottons, together with cour&s;e Wool for Mattre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>From <HI>Larneca</HI> 'till we came in view of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Syria,</HI> we had the Wind very favourable; but at length coming to prove a little contrary, in&s;tead of carrying us to <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> it ca&s;t us to the Northward, two or three Leagues higher, upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> toward a Town call'd <HI>Pa&iuml;a&s;&s;es.</HI> Half a League from that City ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s a va&s;t Rock, and between that Rock and the Land runs a very high Sea: And here it was that the people of the Country believe that the Whale ca&s;t up <HI>Jonas</HI> again; though the common Opinion reports it to have been done near <HI>Joppa</HI> in <HI>Pale&s;tine.</HI> All along that Coa&s;t from <HI>Alexandretta</HI> to <HI>Pa&iuml;a&s;&s;es,</HI> and farther, the way is &s;o narrow and &s;traiten'd by the Mountain, that in &s;ome parts the Camels and Hor&s;es mu&s;t dip their Feet in the Sea: and yet you mu&s;t pa&s;s that way of nece&s;&s;ity, travelling from <HI>Syria</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Between <HI>Alexandretta</HI> and <HI>Pa&iuml;a&s;&s;es</HI> it was, that the <HI>Chevalier Paul,</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el that carry'd only three hundred Men, mi&s;s'd but little of &s;urpri&s;ing the <HI>Caravan</HI> that every Year carries the Tribute of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> which &s;ince hath never been &s;ent by Sea for fear of the <HI>Malte&s;i.</HI> This Knight had landed his Men, and laid them in Ambu&s;cade; but unfortunately his De&s;ign was di&s;cover'd, &s;o that the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that might have been ea&s;ily &s;urpriz'd, &s;tood upon their Guard.</P>
<P>We were near the Coa&s;t, when we di&s;cover'd a Skiff with fifteen or &s;ixteen <HI>Turks,</HI> that were &s;ent by him that commanded four Galleys of <HI>Rhodes</HI> to demand the Cu&s;tomary Pre&s;ent from our Captain. Tho&s;e Galleys then anchor'd at <HI>Pa&iuml;a&s;&s;es,</HI> and had there di&s;charg'd them&s;elves of their Provi&s;ions of War for <HI>Bagdat,</HI> which the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> was going to be&s;iege. And it is the cu&s;tom, that when the Great <HI>Turk</HI>'s Galleys are out at Sea, that whatever &s;trange Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;es by them mu&s;t &s;end them a Pre&s;ent, either willingly or by force. When the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of the Sea, who is the Admiral of the <HI>Turks,</HI> is in Per&s;on at Sea, the Ve&s;&s;el which he meets is not excus'd for 2000 Crowns: &s;o that when he &s;ets out from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to crui&s;e, the Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Franks</HI> do all they can to avoid him. There are &s;ome that will &s;eek to e&s;cape in &s;ight of the Galleys, but it has co&s;t them dear. And it happen'd, that one day the Wind &s;lackning, they boarded a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> the Captain and Notary whereof were both &s;eiz'd, and drub'd 'till their Bodies were almo&s;t bruis'd to a Gelly, and they had like to have dy'd upon it, without being the better in their Pur&s;es; for the rudene&s;s of the Cha&s;ti&s;ement did not excu&s;e them from paying the Money which was demanded. Whether our Captain knew any thing of this Example, or whether it were out of his natural heat of Valour, he laugh'd at the Skiff-men, bidding them be gone, and telling them he had no Pre&s;ents for them but Cannon-Bullets. Thereupon the Men return'd to their Galleys, who &s;oon deliver'd us from the true fear we were in, that the gallantry of the Captain had drawn us into an inconvenience. For while we kept the Sea clo&s;e by the Coa&s;t, to ob&s;erve the Countenances of the <HI>Turks,</HI> they weigh'd Anchor, and turn'd their Prows toward <HI>Rhodes.</HI> However, before they left us they &s;ent us a Broad-&s;ide, and our Captain, whatever we could &s;ay, &s;ent them another, which render'd us more guilty. For the <HI>Turks</HI> pretend that when their Navy is at Sea, or only one Squadron, and that a &s;trange Ve&s;&s;el is in &s;ight, &s;he is bound to come as near as the Wind will permit her without being hal'd, for which they will otherwi&s;e make the Commander pay very &s;everely. The Con&s;uls and Merchants of <HI>Aleppo</HI> under&s;tanding what had pa&s;s'd very much blam'd the Captain, fearing a wor&s;e con&s;equence of the bu&s;ine&s;s&punc; But by good fortune the mi&s;carriage was &s;tifl'd and never went farther.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the Wind veering to the We&s;t-North-We&s;t, we &s;ail'd into the Road of <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> where we came to an Anchor, about a quarter of a League from the Land. Upon the advice which they have out of Chri&s;tendom, &s;o &s;oon as they of <HI>Alexandretta</HI> di&s;cover a Ve&s;&s;el, and know what Colours &s;he carries&punc; the Vice-Con&s;ul of the Nation to which the Ve&s;&s;el belongs, fails not to adverti&s;e the
<PB N="55" REF="40">
Con&s;ul of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> by a Note which is carry'd in four or five hours, though it be more than two or three days journey on Hor&s;e-back. For they tye a Note under the Wing of a Pigeon, who is taught what to do, and &s;he flies directly to the place whence &s;he was brought. For more &s;urety, they u&s;ually &s;end two, that if the one &s;hould mi&s;carry i&punc;the dark, which has many times happen'd, the other may &s;upply the defect.</P>
<P><HI>Alexandretta</HI> is nothing el&s;e but a confus'd heap of paltry Hou&s;es, inhabited by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who keep little Fudling-&s;chools, for the Mariners and others, the meaner &s;ort of the people: for the Merchants lye at the Vice-Con&s;uls of the Nation. There were but two then, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul and the <HI>French;</HI> who had each of them a very convenient dwelling. However&punc; they mu&s;t be men who love Money at a &s;trange&punc;rate, that accept of tho&s;e Employments. For the Air, like that of <HI>Ormus,</HI> is generally &s;o bad&punc; e&s;pecially in the Summer, in &s;o much that they who do not dye, cannot avoid very dangerous Di&s;tempers. If there be any &s;o &s;trong that they can hold out for three or four Years, and can accu&s;tom them&s;elves to a bad Air, they do well to &s;tay there; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> for them to betake them&s;elves to a good Air, is to hazard their Lives. Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul has been the only Per&s;on that ever liv'd two and twenty Years at <HI>Alexandretta:</HI> but you mu&s;t know he was a brisk merry Man, and of an excellent temper of Body; and yet for all that he had been forc'd to be cauteriz'd. That which renders the Air &s;o bad, is the great quantity of &s;tanding Pools and Pla&s;hes in the neighbouring Plains, extending to the Ea&s;t and South; but when the great Heats begin to approach, the mo&s;t part of the Inhabi|tants retire to a Village call'd <HI>Belan,</HI> upon the next Mountain to the City, where there are very good Waters and excellent Fruits. They come al&s;o thither from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> when there is an appearance of a Pe&s;tilence; and yet there are few people in this Village who are not troubled with a &s;ort of Fever, that makes their Eyes look&punc; yellow and hollow; which they never can remedy as long as they live.</P>
<P>About half a League from <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> on &punc;the right hand of the High way, ju&s;t again&s;t the Mer&s;h on the other &s;ide, is a Tower whereon are to be &s;een the Arms of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign.</HI> In all likelihood it was built for the defence of the High-way, which is enclos'd between the&s;e two Merches, who&s;e Exhalations are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ery noxious.</P>
<P>It is but three little days journey from <HI>Alexandretta</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and &s;ome well mounted have rid it in two. The <HI>Franks</HI> are not permitted to go thither on Foot. For before that Prohibition, in regard the way was &s;hort, every Sea-man that had a hundred Crowns, more or le&s;s, went on Foot to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and got ea&s;ily thither in three days, with little expence. Now becau&s;e they had but little Money to &s;pend, and were willing to di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;s, they would not &s;tand to give Four or Five in the Hundred extraordinary for what Goods they bought, which was of dangerous con&s;equence to the Merchants. For you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when the Ships arrive, the fir&s;t man that either out of ra&s;hne&s;s or ignorance, gives two Sous more for a Commodity that is not worth a Crown, &s;ets the Price, and cau&s;es all the whole Commodity to be &s;old at that rate. So that the Merchants that lay out ten or twelve thou&s;and Crowns together, are very careful le&s;t tho&s;e Saylors &s;hould get before them, and enhance the Price of the Market.</P>
<P>To remedy which inconvenience, the Merchants obtain'd an Order, That no Strangers &s;hould be permitted to go a-foot from <HI>Alexandretta</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> but that they &s;hould be bound to hire Hor&s;es, and to give for every Hor&s;e &s;ix Pia&s;ters thi|ther, and &s;ix back; which expence would &s;oon eat out the Profit of a poor Mari|ner's &s;mall Sum.</P>
<P>U&s;ually you &s;tay at <HI>Alexandretta</HI> three or foor days, as well to re&s;t your &s;elf, as to make &s;ome little Provi&s;ions for your Journey to <HI>Aleppo.</HI> For though you meet with good Stages at Evening, yet the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> will be very glad to eat by the way.</P>
<P>Setting out from <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> we travel'd over a Plain to the foot of a Mountain which is call'd <HI>Belan.</HI> There is a wide Gap in the mid&s;t of this Mountain, which giving liberty to the North-Ea&s;t Wind, when it blows hard, doth &s;o enrage the Road of <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> which is otherwi&s;e very calm, that no Ship can ride there at that time. In &s;o much that all Ships that happ'n to be there when the Wind ri&s;es, pre&s;ently weigh, and get out to Sea, for fear of being ca&s;t away. Almo&s;t at
<PB N="56" REF="41">
the top of the Mountain you meet with an Inn; but though it be very fair one, with Fountains round about it, yet Merchants never &s;top there, but go on a little farther to a <HI>Grecian</HI> that &s;peaks good <HI>Italian,</HI> and who&s;e entertainment is indifferent good, con&s;idering the Country. When you go away, you give him a Crown for your accommodation, which is the manner at other Stages, by a cu&s;tom, which the <HI>Franks</HI> them&s;elves having e&s;tabli&s;h'd, will never be left off.</P>
<P>De&s;cending down the Mountain you di&s;cover the City of <HI>Antioch,</HI> built upon a Hill. Formerly the Road lay through that City&punc; but the <HI>Janizaries</HI> of the place exacting a Pia&s;ter from every per&s;on that travel'd that way, that Road is now di&s;us'd. <HI>Antioch</HI> once made more noi&s;e in the World, being fal'n to ruine ever &s;ince the Chanel, that ran from the City to the Sea, where Galleys might ride, has been &s;top'd up by the Sands that have encroach'd upon the Mouth of the Haven.</P>
<P>When you are at the bottom of the Hill toward the North, you di&s;cover a Ca&s;tle built upon a Hill &s;tanding by it &s;elf, from whence you have a pro&s;pect over a good part of the Plain of <HI>Antioch.</HI> It is about fifteen Leagues long, and three broad, in that part where the Road lyes. Somewhat more than half the way, you meet with a long Cau&s;ey parted by &s;everal Bridges, by rea&s;on of certain Rivulets that cro&s;s it, without which the Road were hardly pa&s;&s;able. The frequent Revolts of <HI>Baegdat</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> which the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> has been forc'd &s;o often to be&s;iege, caus'd the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Achmat</HI> to undertake this Cau&s;ey, which together with the Bridge was fini&s;h'd in &s;ix Months, that was lookt upon as a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a|cle. This was done for the more ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age of the Artillery, and other Provi&s;ions of War, that were brought out of <HI>Romania</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> to the Siege of <HI>Baegdat,</HI> which could never have been done, but for this Cau&s;ey. At the end of this Cau&s;ey &s;tands a Bridge, very long and &s;trongly built, under which runs a River, which, with the other Rivulets that wind about the Plain, forms a Lake toward the South, that is call'd the Lake of <HI>Antioch.</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> This Lake affords a great Revenue, by rea&s;on of the Eels that are caught there, which are taken two Months beofre <HI>Lent,</HI> and tran&s;ported to <HI>Malta Sicily,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>This Plain is very full of Olive-Trees; which produces that great Trade of Soap, that is made at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and tran&s;ported into <HI>Mc&s;opotamia, Chaldea, Per&s;ia,</HI> and the De&s;ert; that Commodity being one of the mo&s;t acceptable Pre&s;ents that can be made to the <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bians.</HI> Sallet Oyl is al&s;o in great e&s;teem among them: &s;o that when you make them a Pre&s;ent of it, they will take off their Bonnets, and rub their Heads, their Faces, and their Beards with it, lifting up their Eyes to Heaven, and cry in their Language, <HI>God be thank'd.</HI> Therein they have lo&s;t nothing of the ancient cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;tern People, of which there is often mention made in Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>About a League and a half beyond the Plain, you meet with a Rock, at the foot whereof is a little deep Lake, wherein they catch a world of Fi&s;h that are like our Barbels. I have kill'd them with my Pi&s;tol; and found them to be of an excellent ta&s;t; though they are not regarded at <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>Two hours after you fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d a River which is call'd <HI>Afrora;</HI> though if it have hap|pen'd to rain, you mu&s;t &s;tay 'till the Waters are fal'n. Having pa&s;t the River, upon the Banks whereof you &s;tay to feed your &s;elf and your Hor&s;es, you come to lye at a poor Village call'd <HI>Shaquemin,</HI> where there is an Inn. Here the Country-people bring Provi&s;ions of Food to the Travellers; and whether you eat or no, you mu&s;t pay a Pia&s;ter, according to the cu&s;tom which the <HI>Franks</HI> have e&s;tabli&s;h'd. After you have pa&s;s'd the Plain of <HI>Antioch</HI> as far as <HI>Shaquemin,</HI> the Hor&s;es in Summer are &s;o terribly tormented with a &s;ort of great Flies, that it were impo&s;&s;ible to travel three or four hours together, were it not for going out of the Road, either to the right, or to the left, and riding through the Fields, which are full of tho&s;e Burrs that our Clothworkers make u&s;e of: For in regard they grow as high as the Crupper of the Hor&s;e, they keep the Flies off from &s;tinging and tyring the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">es.</P>

<P><HI>ALeppo</HI> is one of the mo&s;t famous Cities in all <HI>Turkie,</HI> as well for the bigne&s;s and beauty of it, as for the goodne&s;s of the Air, and plenty of all things; together with the great Trade which is driv'n there by all the Nations of the World. It lyes in 71 Deg. 41 Min. of Longitude, and 36 Deg. 15 Min. of Latitude, in an excellent Soil. With all the &s;earch that I could make, I could never learn how it was anciently call'd.

This City was taken by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in the fifteenth Year of the <HI>Hegyra</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which was about the Year of <HI>CHRIST</HI> 637, in the Reign of <HI>Heraclius</HI> Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The City is built upon four Hills, and the Ca&s;tle upon the highe&s;t that &s;tands in the middle of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> being &s;upported by Arches in &s;ome places, for fear the Earth &s;hould tumble and moulder away from it. The Ca&s;tle is large, and may be about five or &s;ix hundred Paces in compa&s;s. The Walls and Towers, though built of Free-&s;tone, are of little defence. There is but one Gate to enter into it from the South, over a Draw-bridge, laid over certain Arches cro&s;s a Moat about &s;ix or &s;even Fathom deep. There is but one half of it full of Water, and that a &s;tanding Puddle to boot; the re&s;t is a meer dry Ditch; &s;o that it cannot be accounted a whol&s;om place. However there is Water brought into the Ca&s;tle through a large Pipe from the Fountains in the City: and there is a &s;trong Garri&s;on kept in it.</P>
<P>The City is above three Miles in circuit, and the be&s;t half of it is unmoated; that Moat there is not above three Fathom deep. The Walls are very good, and all of Free-&s;tone; with &s;everal &s;quare Towers, di&s;tant one from the other about four|&s;core Paces; between which there are others al&s;o that are le&s;s. But the&s;e Walls are not all of them of an equal height, for in &s;ome places they are not above four Fathoms from the Ground. There are ten Gates to enter into the City, without either Moat or Draw-Bridge; under one of which there is a place that the <HI>Turks</HI> have in great veneration; where they keep Lamps continually burning, and report that <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> the Prophet liv'd for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>There is no River that runs through <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and but only a &s;mall one without the City, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Co&iuml;c.</HI> However, though indeed it be but pro|perly a Rivulet, yet it is very u&s;eful to water the Gardens, where grows an abun|dance of Fruit, particularly Pi&s;taches, much bigger, and better ta&s;ted than tho&s;e that comes from the parts near <HI>Casbin.</HI> But though there be no River, yet there are &s;tore of Fountains and Receptacles of Water, which they bring from two places di&s;tant from the City.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="43">
The Edifices, neither publick nor private, are very hand&s;om, but only within|&s;ide; the Walls are of Marble of &s;everal colours, and the Cieling of Foliage Fret-work, with In&s;criptions in Golden Letters. Without and within the City there are &s;ix and twenty <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> &s;ix or &s;even whereof are very magnificent, with &s;tately <HI>Duomo's,</HI> three being cover'd with Lead. The chiefe&s;t and large&s;t of all, was a Chri&s;tian Church which they call'd <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hha,</HI> or <HI>Li&s;ten'd unto:</HI> which is thought to have been built by St. <HI>Helen.</HI> In one part of the Suburbs al&s;o &s;tands another <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which was formerly a Chri&s;tian Church; in that there is one thing worthy ob&s;ervation. In the Wall upon the right &s;ide of the Gate there is a Stone to be &s;een two or three Foot &s;quare, wherein there is the figure of a hand|&s;om Chalice, and a Sacrifice over the hollow of it, with a Cre&s;cent that covers the Sacrifice, the two Horns whereof de&s;cend ju&s;t upon the brims of the mouth of the Chalice. One would think at fir&s;t that tho&s;e Figures were in <HI>Mo&s;a&iuml;c.</HI> Work: but it is all Natural, as I have found with &s;everal other <HI>Franks,</HI> having &s;crap'd the Stone with an Iron In&s;trument, when the <HI>Turks</HI> were out of the way. Several Con&s;uls would have bought it, and there has been offer'd for it 2000 Crowns; but the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI> would never &s;uffer it to be &s;old. Half a League from the City lyes a plea&s;ant Hill, where the <HI>Franks</HI> are wont to take the Air. On the &s;ide of that Hill is to be &s;een a Cave or <HI>Grotto,</HI> where the <HI>Turks</HI> report that <HI>Haly</HI> liv'd for &s;ome few days; and for that there is an ill-&s;hap'd figure of a Hand imprinted in the Rock, they farther believe it to be the Hand of <HI>Haly.</HI></P>
<P>There are three Colledges in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> but very few Scholars, though there be Men of Learning that belong to them, who have Salaries to teach Grammar, and their odd kind of Philo&s;ophy, with the Grounds of their Religion, which are the Principal Sciences to which the <HI>Turks</HI> apply them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Streets of the City are all pav'd, except the <HI>Bazar's,</HI> where the Merchants and Handicraft-Trade&s;men keep their Shops. The chiefe&s;t Arti&s;ts, and the mo&s;t numerous are Silk and Camlet-Weavers.</P>
<P>In the City and Suburbs there are about forty Inns; and fifty publick Baths, as well for Women as for Men, keeping their turns. 'Tis the chiefe&s;t Pa&s;time the Women have to go to the Baths; and they will &s;pare all the Week long to carry a Collation, when they go at the Weeks end to make merry among them&s;elves, in tho&s;e places of privacy.</P>
<P>The Suburbs of the City are large and well peopl'd, for almo&s;t all the Chri&s;tians have their Hou&s;es and Churches there. Of which Chri&s;tians there are four &s;orts in <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ppo,</HI> I mean of Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians, that is to to &s;ay, <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Jacobites</HI> or <HI>Syrians,</HI> and <HI>Maronites.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> have an Archbi&s;hop there, and are about fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and in number; their Church is dedicated to St. <HI>George.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> have a Bi&s;hop, whom they call <HI>Vertabet;</HI> and are about twelve thou|&s;and in number; their Church is dedicated to the Virgin. The <HI>Jacobites</HI> being about ten thou&s;and, have a Bi&s;hop al&s;o; and their Church is likewi&s;e dedicated to the Virgin, as is that of the <HI>Armenians.</HI> The <HI>Maronites</HI> depend upon the Pope, not being above twelve hundred; their Church being con&s;ecrated to St. <HI>Elias.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|tholicks have three Churches, &s;erv'd by the <HI>Capuchins, Carmelites,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;uits.</HI> They reckon that in the Suburbs and City of <HI>Aleppo</HI> there are about 250000 Souls.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t Trade at <HI>Aleppo</HI> for Silks and Camlets, but chiefly for Gall-Nuts, and <HI>Valanede,</HI> which is a &s;ort of Acorn-&s;hell without which the Curriers cannot dre&s;s their Leather. They have al&s;o a great Trade for Soap, and for &s;everal other Commodities; the Merchants repairing thither from all parts of the World. For not to &s;peak of the <HI>Turks, Arabians, Per&s;ians, Indians,</HI> there are &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h, Ita|lians, French,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> every Nation having their Con&s;ul to carry on their In|tere&s;ts, and maintain their Priviledges.</P>
<P>Nor does this place happ'n to be &s;o great a Mart, through the convenience of the two Rivers of <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> as &s;ome have writt'n; by which they &s;ay &s;uch va&s;t quantities of Commodities are tran&s;ported and imported out and into the City. For had that been, I &s;hould never have cro&s;s'd the De&s;ert, coming from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> nor at another time, going from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> And as for <HI>Euphrates,</HI> certain it is, that the great number of Mills built upon it, to bring the Water to the neighbouring Grounds, have not only render'd it unnavigable, but made it very dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="43">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that in the year 1638 I &s;aw a great part of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Army, and &s;everal Boats full of Warlike Provi&s;ions fall down the Stream, when he went to be&s;ieg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it: but when they were forc'd to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e away all the Mills that are upon the River; which was not done without a va&s;t trouble and expence. As for <HI>Tigris,</HI> it is not navigable 'till beyond <HI>Babylon</HI> down to <HI>Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ara,</HI> where you may take Water, and be at <HI>Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ara</HI> in nine days. But the Voyage is very inconvenient, for at every Town which the <HI>Arabs</HI> have upon the River, you mu&s;t be hal'd, and be forc'd to leave &s;ome Money behind you. Som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">times indeed the Merchants of <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul</HI> and <HI>Bagdat;</HI> and others that come out of <HI>Chaldea</HI> to T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ade at <HI>Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ara,</HI> carry their Goods by Water from <HI>Bagdat;</HI> but in regard the Boats are only to be tow'd by Men, it takes them up a Voyage of &s;eventy days. By this you may judge of the time and expence of carrying Goods by Water up the River <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Bir,</HI> where they are to be unlad'n for <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, if the convenience of <HI>Morat-&s;ou</HI> (for &s;o the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Euphrates)</HI> were to be had, and that Goods might be tran&s;ported by that River, the Merchants would never take that way: for the <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, with their People and their Cattel lying all the Summer long upon the Banks of the River, for the &s;ake of the Water and the Gra&s;s, would make the Merchants pay what Toll they pleas'd them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;aw an Example of this, coming one time from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Aleppo.</HI> In all which Road we met but with one of tho&s;e <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, who lay at <HI>Anna:</HI> yet he made us pay for every Camel's Load forty <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI> And which was wor&s;e, he detain'd us above five Weeks, to the end his Subjects might get more of our Money by &s;elling us their Provi&s;ions. The la&s;t time I pa&s;s'd the De&s;ert, I met another of the&s;e <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes together with his Brother, both young Men: He would not let us go a &s;tep farther, unle&s;s we would exchange two hundred <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> in &s;pecie for <HI>Larins,</HI> the Money of the Country; and he forc'd us to take them what ever we could urge to make it appear how much we &s;hould lo&s;e by them. And indeed we &s;aid as much as we could, for the di&s;pute la&s;ted two and twenty days to no purpo&s;e; might overcoming right. By this you may gue&s;s what the other <HI>Arabians</HI> would do, who are not a jot more civil; and whether the Merchants would get by taking the Road of <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>The City is govern'd by a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who commands all the Country from <HI>Alexan|dretta</HI> to <HI>Euphrates.</HI> His Guard u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ts of three hundred Men, and &s;ome years ago he was made a <HI>Vizier.</HI> There is al&s;o an <HI>Aga</HI> or Captain of the Cavalry, as well within the City as without, who commands four hundred Men. There is another <HI>Aga</HI> who has under him &s;even hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who has the charge of the Gates of the City; to whom the Keys are carry'd every Evening, neither has he any dependance upon the <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI> The Ca&s;tle is al&s;o under another Commander&punc; &s;ent immediately from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who has under him two hundred Musketeers, and likewi&s;e the charge of the Cannon; of which there are about thirty Pieces; eight great Guns, the re&s;t of a &s;mall &s;ize. There is al&s;o another <HI>Aga</HI> or Captain of the City, who commands three hundred Harquebuzes; be&s;ide a <HI>Son-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who is a kind of Provo&s;t of the Merchants, or Captain of the Watch, going the round every Night with his Officers though the City and Suburbs. He al&s;o puts in Execution the Sentences of the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> upon Criminal Offenders.</P>
<P>In Civils there is a <HI>Cadi,</HI> who &s;its &s;ole Judge, without any <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tants,</HI> of all Cau&s;es as well Civil as Criminal; and when he has condemn'd any Man to Death, he &s;ends him to the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> together with his Accu&s;ation, with whom the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> does as he plea&s;es. This <HI>Cady</HI> makes and di&s;&s;olves all Contracts of Marriage; all Acts of Sale and Purcha&s;e pa&s;s in his pre&s;ence. He al&s;o creates the &s;worn Ma&s;ters of every Trade, who make their in&s;pection that there may be no deceit in the Work. The Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Duties are receiv'd by a <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> or Trea&s;urer-General, who has under him &s;everal Receivers in divers places.</P>
<P>In matters of Religion, the <HI>Muf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> is the Chief, and the Interpreter of the Law, as well in relation to the Ceremonies, as in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical differences.

<P>Three days after I arriv'd at <HI>Aleppo, Sultan Amurat</HI> made his Entry, going to
<PB N="60" REF="44">
his Army, which was upon its march to the Siege of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Now you mu&s;t take notice, that nor far from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> toward the Ea&s;t, there &s;tands a Hou&s;e inha|bited by the <HI>Dervies,</HI> which are a Religious Order among the <HI>Turks;</HI> though it formerly belong'd to the Monks of St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and was a fair Covent. It is &s;till in good repair, the Walls of the Chambers, Halls, and Galleries being all Marble. All the <HI>Dervies</HI> of this Hou&s;e went half a League from the City, as far as Mount <HI>Ozelet,</HI> to meet the Grand <HI>Signor;</HI> and the Superiour, at the Head of the re&s;t, having made a Speech to his Highne&s;s, two <HI>Dervies</HI> came and made their obei&s;ance in particular. Which being perform'd, from that place to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> for half an hours march together; they went ju&s;t before the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Hor&s;e, turning round continually with all their might, 'till they foam'd again at the Mouth, and dazl'd the Eyes of tho&s;e that beheld them. There are &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Dervies</HI> that will turn in that manner for two hours together, and glory in that which we account folly.</P>
<P>While the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> &s;taid at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Cayro</HI> came thither with a thou&s;and <HI>Jani&s;aries:</HI> And indeed, there never was a &s;ight of Men more active, or better order'd. Every one of them had Scarlet Breeches that reach'd down to their Ancles, with a <HI>Turkie</HI>-Robe of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, and a Wa&s;t-coat of Calicut painted with &s;everal Colours. The mo&s;t part had Buttons of Gold and Silk; and as well their Girdles as their Scimitars were adorn'd with Silver. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> march'd at the Head of this Magnificent Regiment in a mode&s;t Garb; but the Harne&s;s of his Hor&s;e was as rich as his Habit &s;eem'd to be carele&s;s, having &s;par'd for no Co&s;t to appear before the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> in a &s;tately Equipage.</P>
<P>There is a nece&s;&s;ity for a Man to &s;tay &s;ome time at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> as well to di&s;po&s;e of his Affairs, and in expectation 'till the <HI>Caravan</HI> be ready, unle&s;s he will venture him&s;elf alone without a Guide, which I have done more than once. And thus much for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> next to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Cayro,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable City in all the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;everal Roads in general from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and par|ticularly of the Road through the great De&s;ert.</HEAD>
<P>THere are five principal Roads from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which being added to tho&s;e other Roads which I have di&s;crib'd through <HI>Natolia,</HI> make &s;even Roads into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> parting from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> or <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the five Roads, &s;etting out from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> is upon the left hand, to|ward the Summer-Ea&s;t, through <HI>Diarbck</HI> and <HI>Tauris.</HI> The &s;econd directly Ea&s;t, by <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> through <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul</HI> and <HI>Amadan.</HI> The third upon the right hand, toward the Winter-Ea&s;t, through <HI>Bagdat</HI> and <HI>Kengavar.</HI> The fourth &s;omewhat more to the South, cro&s;&s;ing a little De&s;ert, through <HI>Anna, Bagdat,</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> The fifth through the great De&s;ert, which is an extraordinary Road, never travel'd but once a year, when the Merchants of <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> go to buy Camels. Of the&s;e Roads I intend to treat di&s;tinctly, and in &s;everal Chapters. And fir&s;t of the Road through the great De&s;ert.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravans</HI> that go to <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> this way never &s;et out 'till the Rains are fal'n, that they may not want Water in the De&s;ert: and the Rain &s;eldom holds up 'till <HI>December.</HI> This <HI>Caravan,</HI> with which I travel'd, &s;et out upon <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>-day, con|&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix hundred Camels, and four hundred Men, Ma&s;ters and Servants together: the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> being only on Hor&s;e-back, and riding before, to find Water, and convenient places to lodge in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had the convenience my &s;elf to ride my own Hor&s;e, which I kept all the while I was at <HI>Aleppo.</HI> A liberty permitted the <HI>Franks</HI> only at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> and <HI>Aleppo&punc;</HI> for at <HI>Damas, Seyde,</HI> or <HI>Cayro,</HI> none but the Con&s;uls are &s;uffer'd
<PB N="61" REF="44">
to keep Hor&s;es: others can only keep or hire A&s;&s;es, which &s;tand ready in the publick Streets at all times.</P>
<P>The next day we di&s;lodg'd by day-break, and by noon we came to a place where there were five Wells, about five hundred Paces di&s;tant one from the other. The Water was excellent, and caus'd us to repleni&s;h our <HI>Boracho's:</HI> and about four a Clock in the Afternoon we lay at a place where there was no Water.</P>
<P>The next day near noon we met&punc; with two Wells, but the Water was not good, and only the Camels drank of it, there we al&s;o lodg'd that night.</P>
<P>Having now travel'd two days in the De&s;ert, I will de&s;cribe it in a few words. You begin to enter upon it two or three Leagues from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where by de|grees you meet with nothing but Tents in&s;tead of Hou&s;es. It &s;tretches out to the Winter-Ea&s;t, all along the <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and the Shoar of the Gulf of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and upon the South to the Chain of Mountains that divides it from <HI>Arabia Petr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> and <HI>Arabia the Happy.</HI> The&s;e De&s;erts are almo&s;t quite thorough nothing but Plains of Sand, which in &s;ome places lye loo&s;er than in others; and are hardly pa&s;&s;able till the Rains are but newly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al'n, and have knit the Sands together. 'Tis a rare thing to meet with a Hill or a Valley in the&s;e De&s;erts; if you do, there is as &s;urely Water, and as many Bu&s;hes as will &s;erve to boyl a little Rice. For thoughout the whole De|&s;ert there is no Wood to be found; and all the Bavins and Charcoal that you can load upon Camels at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> will not la&s;t above eight or ten days. Therefore you mu&s;t take notice, that of &s;ix hundred Camels that pa&s;s through the De&s;ert, there are &s;carce fifty laden with Merchandize, which is generally cour&s;e Cloth, &s;ome little Iron Ware, but chiefly black and blew Calicuts, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> make u&s;e of without ever whitening them. All the other Camels are only laden with Provi&s;ion, and all little enough; &s;o many People being to travel for &s;o many days through &s;o long a Tract of Ground where there is nothing in the World to &s;u&s;tain Life and Soul together.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t fifteen days travel we met with Water but once in two days, and &s;ometimes not above once in three days. The twentieth day after we &s;et out from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> lay at a place where there were two Wells, and the Water very good. Every one was glad of the convenience of wa&s;hing his Linnen, and the <HI>Ca|ravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> made account to have &s;taid there two or three days. But the News that we receiv'd, caus'd us to alter our Re&s;olutions. For we had no &s;ooner giv'n order to dre&s;s our Suppers, when we &s;aw a Courier with three <HI>Arabs,</HI> all mounted upon Dromedaries, who were &s;ent to carry the news of the Taking of <HI>Babylon</HI> to to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and other Cities of the Empire. They &s;top'd at the Wells to let their Bea&s;ts drink; and immediately the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi,</HI> and the principal per&s;ons of the <HI>Caravan</HI> made them a &s;mall Pre&s;ent of dry'd Fruits and Granates. Who thereupon were &s;o kind as to tell us, that the Carriage which carried the Baggage belonging to the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> and his Train being tyr'd, his Officers would be &s;ure to &s;eize upon ours, if they &s;hould chance to meet with us: they advis'd us moreover not to come near <HI>Anna,</HI> le&s;t the <HI>Emir</HI> &s;hould &s;top us.</P>
<P>Upon this news, we departed three hours after midnight; and keeping directly to the South, we put our &s;elves into the mid&s;t of the De&s;ert.</P>
<P>Eight days after we came to lye at a place where three Wells, and three or four Hou&s;es. We &s;taid there two days to take fre&s;h Water, and we were ju&s;t &s;etting forward again, when thirty Hor&s;emen well mounted came from one of the <HI>Emirs,</HI> to tell the <HI>Caravan Ba&s;hi</HI> that he mu&s;t &s;top his <HI>Caravan.</HI> We &s;taid impa|tiently for him three days; and at length he came, and was pre&s;ented by the <HI>Cara|van-Ba&s;hi</HI> with a piece of Satin, half a piece of Scarlet Cloth, and two large Cop|per Cauldrons. Now although tho&s;e Cauldrons could not but be very acceptable to an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, who mo&s;t certainly had none &s;uch in his Kitchin, vet he did not &s;eem contented with his Pre&s;ent, and demanded above four hundred Crowns&punc; We conte&s;ted &s;even or eight days to have kept our Money in our Pockets, but in vain, &s;o that we were forc'd to rate one another, and to rai&s;e him his Sum; which being paid, he treated the chief of the <HI>Caravan</HI> with Pilaw, Honey, and Dates, and when he went away, give them five or &s;ix Sheep ready boyl'd.</P>
<P>Three days after we had le&s;t this <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, we met with two Wells near certain old decay'd Brick Buildings. The Water of tho&s;e Wells was &s;o bitter, that the Camels would not drink it: however we fill'd our <HI>Boracho</HI>'s, thinking
<PB N="62" REF="45">
it would have left its bitterne&s;s by being boyl'd: but we found the contrary.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e two Wells that were good for nothing, we travel'd &s;ix days before we met with any Water, which with their three days before, made nine; and all that time the Camels never drank, as I have hinted already. At the end of nine days we cro&s;s'd a Hilly Country for three Leagues together, at the feet of three of which Hills there were three &s;tanding Pools. The Camels, that &s;melt the Water half a League off, put them&s;elves upon their great trot, which is their manner of running, and no &s;ooner came to the Pools but they crouded in all together, which caus'd the Water to be thick and muddy. Thereupon the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> re&s;olv'd to &s;tay there two or three days together, 'till the Water was &s;etl'd. Here we had al&s;o the opportunity to boyl us &s;ome Rice, there being good &s;tore of Bu&s;hes that grew about the Lake. But above all, the People were over joy'd that they had an opportunity to make Bread, which they do after the following manner. Fir&s;t they dig a round Hole in the Ground, half a Foot deep, and two or three in diameter, which they croud full of Bu&s;hes, and then &s;et them on fire, covering them with Bricks or Stones 'till they are red hot. In the mean while they prepare their Dough upon a <HI>Sofra,</HI> or round piece of Copper, which &s;erves at other times for Table and Table-Cloth to eat upon. Then they take away the A&s;hes and Bricks, and making the Hole very clean, put in their Dough, and covering it again with the hot Bricks or Stones, leave it &s;o 'till the morning. The Bread thus bak'd is very well ta&s;ted, not being above two Fingers thick, and as big as an ordinary Cake.</P>
<P>While we &s;tay'd at the three Ponds, I &s;pent my time in killing Hares and Par|tridge, of which there was very great plenty in tho&s;e parts. The night before we departed we fill'd our <HI>Baracho's</HI> again, the Water being very good and clear; though it be nothing but Rain water pre&s;erv'd in tho&s;e Cavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, which in the Sum|mer are dry again.</P>
<P>But now the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi,</HI> &s;eeing we had travel'd already nine days without finding any Water, re&s;olv'd to leave the South, and to keep to the We&s;t; and if he met not with Water in two or three days, to take to the North-Ea&s;t, or Winter-Ea&s;t, in que&s;t of the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after we had chang'd our Road, we pa&s;s'd between two little Hills, where we met with a Pond, near to which were two <HI>Arabians,</HI> each with his Wife and Children, tending a Herd of Goats and a Flock of Sheep. They told us they were going toward <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> and put us in the be&s;t Road to find Water; and indeed, from that place to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> we never travel'd three days together, but we met with enough.</P>
<P>Five days after we had left tho&s;e two <HI>Arabians,</HI> we di&s;cover'd a large Palace all of Brick; which &s;hew'd &s;ome probability, that the Country had been formerly &s;ow'd, and that the Bricks had been bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt with the Straw. To the Palace belong'd three large Courts; in every one of which were fair Buildings, with two Stories of Arches, one upon another. Though this large Pile was &s;tanding, yet no body liv'd in it, nor could the <HI>Arabians,</HI> (very ignorant in Antiquity,) tell us by whom it was built. Before the Gate of the Palace there is a Lake with a Channel, the bottom whereof is brick'd, as al&s;o the Arch, which is even with the Ground. This the <HI>Arabians</HI> believe to have been a conveyance of Water from <HI>Euphrates:</HI> which &s;urely could never be, in regard that <HI>Euphrates</HI> is above twenty Leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>From that Palace we kept to the North-Ea&s;t, and after we had travel'd five days, we arriv'd at a pitiful Town, formerly call'd <HI>Cufa,</HI> now <HI>Meched-Ali,</HI> where <HI>Ali, Mahomet</HI>'s Son in-law lyes buried in a plain <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> Generally there &s;tand four Tapers lighted about the Tomb, and certain Lamps burning over-head, which are fa&s;ten'd to the Roof.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have <HI>Ali</HI> in &s;o much veneration, yet they rarely go in Pil|grimage to his Tomb. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that there being no way to come at it, but through <HI>Bagdat,</HI> which is under the Dominion of the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> there is a demand of eight <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> from every Pilgrim; which is an Impo&s;ition that no way plea&s;es the King of <HI>Per&s;ia. Sha-Abas</HI> &s;corning that his Subjects &s;hould be tributary to the <HI>Turks,</HI> endeavour'd to divert them from this Pilgrimage by another &s;ort of Devotion, which he &s;et up at <HI>Me&s;h&eacute;ed,</HI> upon the Road from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Candahar.</HI> Nor have the Kings his Succe&s;&s;ors been le&s;s unwilling to give their Subjects leave to vi&s;it their Prophet <HI>Ali,</HI> taking it for an Affront to pay Tribute to the Grand <HI>Signor.</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="45">
Which is the rea&s;on that this <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> is no more enrich'd by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> For be&s;ides the Lamps and Tapers that burn continually, there are only two <HI>Moullah's</HI> that read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> according to cu&s;tom. In this Town there are only three or four bad Wells of bracki&s;h Water, and a dry Chanel, which they &s;ay <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> made to bring the Water of <HI>Euphrates</HI> to the Town for the benefit of the Pilgrims. As for Food, we met with nothing but Dates, Grapes, and Almonds, which the People &s;old at a dear rate. When any Pilgrims come thither, which is very rare, and that they want Victuals, the <HI>Sheck</HI> cau&s;es a di&s;tribution to be made among them of Rice boyl'd with Water and Salt, and a little Butter pour'd atop. For there is no Pa&s;turage for Cattel, and by con&s;equence there can be no &s;tore of Food.</P>
<P>Two days journey from <HI>Ali</HI>'s Town, by nine of the Clock in the morning we met two young <HI>Arabian</HI> Lords, that took upon them the name of <HI>Sultans.</HI> They were two Brothers, one of the age of &s;eventeen years, the other of thirteen: and as we pitch'd our Tents, they pitch'd theirs clo&s;e by us; which were of a very fine Scarlet Cloth; and among the re&s;t there was one cover'd with Purple Velvet, lac'd with a rich Galoon-lace. So &s;oon as they were &s;ettl'd in their Tents, the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> and I went to wait upon them; who under&s;tanding that there were <HI>Franks</HI> in the <HI>Caravan,</HI> ask'd me whether I had any Curio&s;ities to &s;ell them; but when I made them an&s;wer that I had nothing worthy their Purcha&s;e, they would not believe me, and therefore commanded the <HI>Caravan Ba&s;hi</HI> to fetch my Trunks, that they might be open'd in their pre&s;ence. While the were opening, one of the chief per&s;ons about tho&s;e Princes would not &s;uffer any of the re&s;t of the <HI>Arabs</HI> to come near, for though mo&s;t of the <HI>Arabs</HI> are great Thieves, yet &s;ome of them are per&s;ons of great integrity. Now I had in my company a young Painter, who had in his Che&s;t &s;everal engrav'd Cuts, part Landskips, part Figures, together with the Pictures of certain Courti&s;ans drawn to the Wa&s;t. The young Lords made choi&s;e only of twenty of tho&s;e Courti&s;ans, which I would have pre&s;ented to them, but they gave me to under&s;tand, that they knew how to pay for what they had, and e&s;pecially the younge&s;t, who &s;eem'd to be very generous; him I pleas'd in an extraordinary manner; for his Teeth being very foul, I order'd a Chirurgeon that I carry'd along with me at the &s;ame time to clean them, which he did to the great &s;atisfaction of the young Prince. Thereupon they &s;ent me and my Train, of their be&s;t Victuals they had. The <HI>Caravan Ba&s;hi</HI> pre&s;ented them with half a piece of Scarlet, and two pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver. When we were ready to go, the young <HI>Sultan</HI> gave me twelve Ducats for my Pictures, and &s;ent the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> and my &s;elf two Frails of the be&s;t Dates that we had met with &s;ince we left <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>About midnight the Princes di&s;lodg'd, and took to the North toward <HI>Euphrates.</HI> We &s;et forward after them, driving Northward toward the &s;ame River. After we had travel'd four days we met one of the mo&s;t potent <HI>Emirs</HI> of <HI>Arabia,</HI> who coming from the South, and going Northward, was to cro&s;s the Road that we kept. He was about fifty years of age, well made, and of a comely pre&s;ence. He had not then above two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, of thirty thou&s;and which we heard had pa&s;s'd by &s;ome days before. Behind the two thou&s;and Hor&s;e were fifty Camels that carry'd his Women; their <HI>Cajavas</HI> being cover'd with Scarlet-cloth fring'd with Silk. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e Camels there were &s;ix encompa&s;s'd with Eunuchs, the Fringes of the <HI>Cajavas</HI> being Silk, Silver, and Gold. The <HI>Arabians</HI> do not &s;eem to be jealous of their Wives, as in <HI>Turkie</HI> and other places; for they led their Camels by our <HI>Caravan,</HI> never requiring us to retire, as is the cu&s;tom in other places. They lodg'd a quarter of a League off, where we thought to have pitch'd, for the conveniency of two or three Ponds, which they depriv'd us of. This <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince had a great number of lovely Hor&s;es richly harne&s;s'd: others he had that were neither &s;adl'd nor bridl'd, yet the Riders would turn them with a Wand which way they pleas'd, and upon a full gallop would &s;top 'em, by only holding them by the Hair. He had &s;ome Hor&s;es of an exce&s;&s;ive price; and this is to be ob&s;erv'd, that they are never &s;hod.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> believing he could not e&s;cape &s;cot-free from &s;o powerful a Prince, among the Merchants of the <HI>Caravans</HI> found out a rich Saddle, with Bridle and Stirrups, which were all &s;et out and garni&s;h'd with ma&s;&s;y Silver, with an
<PB N="64" REF="46">
embroider'd Quiver full of Arrows, together with a Buckler, the whole coming to about eleven or twelve hundred Livers; and adding to the&s;e of his own a piece of Scarlet, four pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silk, and &s;ix pieces oi Ti&s;&s;ue of Silver and Silk, made a Pre&s;ent of all together to the <HI>Emir.</HI> But he refus'd all, demanding only two bundred thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> for <HI>Larins:</HI> which exchange being no way for the Merchants profit, rais'd a great di&s;pute. But at length, con&s;idering that it was in his power to &s;top and &s;tarve us there, we only endeavour'd a Compo&s;ition; which was obtain'd. Thereupon he took the Pre&s;ent, which perhaps he would not el&s;e have done. For two days that we &s;taid to weigh the Money, he &s;ent Provi&s;ions to the chief of the <HI>Caravan;</HI> and at our departure, he &s;ent u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> twelve Frails of Dates, and four young Camels that might be worth about forty Crowns a-piece.</P>
<P>Two days after we met a <HI>Schek,</HI> who among the <HI>Arabians</HI> is one of the chief of the Law. He was going to <HI>Mecca,</HI> cro&s;s &s;ome part of <HI>Arabia the Happy,</HI> with a Train of ten or twelve Camels. He &s;taid all night with us, and one of his Servants having been dangerou&s;ly wounded about two days before with a Musket-bullet, my Chirurgeon dre&s;t him, and gave him Salve and Tents, for which he was extreamly thankful. He &s;ent me to Supper a great Di&s;h of Pilaw, and the next day a whole Sheep. The <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> likewi&s;e pre&s;ented him with two Ells of Scarlet.</P>
<P>The next we met with nothing worth ob&s;ervation, but the day following we met another <HI>Emir,</HI> of about Five and Twenty years of age&punc; who came from <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and was travelling into the <HI>Happy Arabia.</HI> He had with him about five hundred Hor&s;e, and three hundred Camels that carry'd his women. He pre|&s;ently &s;ent to know what <HI>Caravan</HI> it was, and under&s;tanding that it con&s;i&s;ted of many <HI>Franks,</HI> among whom their was a <HI>Chirurgeon:</HI> He &s;ent again to de&s;ire the <HI>Caravan Ba&s;hi</HI> to follow with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> to the place where he intended to pitch his Tents, which was not far out of the way. We did not think to have gone &s;o far that day, but he led us to the be&s;t water in all the De&s;ert. The Princes Tent being &s;et up, he &s;ent for my <HI>Chirurgeon,</HI> with whom I went along to know what his plea&s;ure was. He had upon his left Arm a Tetter, with a mo&s;t filthy Scab as broad as a Crown piece; and this went and came at certain times in the year. He pre&s;ently ask'd the <HI>Chirurgeon</HI> whether he could cure him? to whom the <HI>Chirurgeon</HI> made an&s;wer, that the cure was not impo&s;&s;ible, provided he knew where to get &s;uch remedies as were convenient: For had he &s;aid, he could have ab&s;o|lutely cur'd him, the <HI>Emir</HI> would have carry'd him away with him, without any farther Ceremony. Thereupon he would have giv'n the <HI>Chirurgeon</HI> five hun|dred Crowns to have bought Medicines. But I made an&s;wer, that the cure would not co&s;t &s;o much, and that if the <HI>Chirurgeon</HI> could meet with proper Drugs, I would lay out the Money my &s;elf. The <HI>Emir</HI> content with that an&s;wer, &s;ent one of his chief People to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> to come back with the <HI>Chirurgeon,</HI> when he had bought his Medicines. He him&s;elf &s;taid there three days in expecttion of him; but after we had pretended to &s;eek for what we wanted, up and down the Town (for we enquir'd for &s;uch things as we knew were not to be had) we &s;ent him back word that we could not find what we look'd for, and de&s;ir'd his excu&s;e, in regard the attendance of the <HI>Chirurgeon</HI> would be of no u&s;e, where he had not proper remedies; which was the only way we could think of, to get cleverly rid of him.</P>
<P>The next days Journey after we had left the <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, was through a Country altogether uninhabited; but the day following, which was the &s;ixty|fifth and la&s;t day of our being in the De&s;ert, we met after &s;ome time, with the ruines of &s;ome hou&s;es on both &s;ides the way; which made us conjecture, that &s;ome great City had &s;tood formerly in that place.</P>
<P>At length we came to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> which I &s;hall de&s;cribe in another place.</P>
<P>While I &s;tay'd at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> which was about three weeks, an Amba&s;&s;ador from the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> arriv'd there, who from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> went to <HI>Bagdat</HI> to congra|tulate the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> for the Conque&s;t of that City, which he had taken in &s;o &s;hort a time. The Emperour pre&s;ented him with three &s;ately Hor&s;es, and a little Watch, the Ca&s;e whereof was &s;et with Diamonds and Rubies. But the Amba&s;|&s;ador not knowing what belong'd to that little Engin, winding it up the wrong way, broke the &s;tring. Coming to <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> he &s;ent to the <HI>Carmalites</HI> to de&s;ire them to mend his Watch; for he fear'd the lo&s;s of his head, &s;hould he return to his
<PB N="65" REF="46">
Ma&s;ter, and not &s;hew him the Watch entire. It was at their Hou&s;e that i then lay; and therefore not knowing what to do with it, they de&s;ir'd&punc; me to &s;hew my skill: Thereupon I put on a new &s;tring. But the Amba&s;&s;ador, when he under&s;tood to whom he was beholding, though it were but a trifle, profer'd me all the &s;ervice and kindne&s;s imaginable. Thereupon the <HI>Carmelites</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> Fryars de&s;ir'd me to reque&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;ador in their behalf, that he would obtain the Great <HI>Turks</HI> protection for them, in ca&s;e he took <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> that their Hou&s;es and Churches might be pre&s;erv'd; which I did, and obtain'd by his means full pro|tection from the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier.</HI> But they had no need of it, for the <HI>Turks</HI> did not make any attempt upon <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> hearing that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were advancing; be&s;ides that the rainy &s;ea&s;on was at hand, which will not permit an Army to keep the Field: So that had <HI>Bagdat</HI> held out eight days longer, the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> would have been con&s;train'd to have rais'd the Siege.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;es, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that there are &s;ome that are valu'd at a very high rate. The <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador gave for &s;ome three, four, and &s;ix thou&s;and Crowns, and for another he offer'd eight thou&s;and Crowns, but the Hor&s;e would not be &s;old under t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and &s;o he left it. When he was got home into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and had pre&s;ented the <HI>Mogul</HI> tho&s;e Hor&s;es which he had carry'd along with him, being very lovely Creatures; he told his Ma&s;ter how he had offer'd eight thou&s;and Crowns for a Hor&s;e more beautiful than any of them; but becau&s;e the Owner would not let him go under ten, he left him. The King incens'd that his Amba&s;&s;ador has &s;tood for &s;o &s;mall a Sum, when it was for one of the greate&s;t Monarchs in the World, upbraided the poorne&s;s of his Spirit, and bani&s;h'd him for ever from his pre&s;ence, into a Province far di&s;tant from the Court. Thereupon the King wrote to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to buy him the Hor&s;e, who accordingly did &s;o, and brought him to <HI>Surat,</HI> where the Governour-repaid them their Money. But the Hor&s;e dy'd at <HI>Brampour.</HI></P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t I forget, that while I was at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> twice there flew by &s;uch a pro|digious number of Locu&s;ts that a far-off they appear'd like a Cloud, and darkn'd the Air. They pa&s;s by <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> four or five times in the year, the Wind carrying them into the De&s;ert, where they alight, and mo&s;t certainly dye. Should they not be thus wind-driv'n, there could nothing live upon the Earth in &s;ome parts of <HI>Chal|dea.</HI> They &s;warm all along the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, and when the Ve&s;&s;els come to <HI>Ormus</HI> at the time of the year, there are little Shops where people &s;ell Locu&s;ts fry'd in Butter to tho&s;e that love that &s;ort of Diet. Once I had the curio&s;ity to open the Belly of a Locu&s;t &s;ix Inches long, and found therein &s;eventeen little ones that &s;tirr'd; whenee it is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s how tho&s;e Infects come to be &s;o numerous, e&s;pecially in hot Countries.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Barks that go from <HI>Ormus</HI> to furni&s;h both of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, where the people eat neither Bread nor Rice. I agreed with the Ma&s;ter of one of the&s;e Barks, and made my agreement that the Bark &s;hould not be above half laden; for generally they lade them too deep, and in foul weather they are forc'd to throw half the Freight over-board, to&punc; &s;ave the re&s;t.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> to the mouth of the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> it is reck'nd to be twenty Leagues of Fre&s;h-water. We &s;taid &s;even whole days for a Wind, which proving favourable, we came to <HI>Brander-ric,</HI> in forty-eight hours. This is the place where you mu&s;t land, if you intend for <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> unle&s;s you are bound for <HI>Ormus. Brander|ric</HI> con&s;i&s;ts only of five or &s;ix little Fi&s;hers Hutts; which Hutts are only Hurdles &s;et one again&s;t another, and cover'd over, where they and their Families live. To the &s;ame place come A&s;&s;es lad'n with Dates, which I was forc'd to hire for want of Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We were &s;ix days upon the Road from thence to <HI>Cazerom.</HI> This is a Mountainous Country, where there is Wood enough; but you mu&s;t lodge in the Fields, for there are no Inns upon the Road. The way is plea&s;ant in &s;ome places, along the Banks of &s;everal Rivulets, and through verdant Groves &s;tor'd with great quantities of Turtles. We kill'd a good many; which we eat, part with Pilaw, in&s;tead of Henns; &s;ome we ro&s;ted, making Sticks to &s;erve for Spits.</P>
<P><HI>Cazerom</HI> is a little Gity ill built, where there is but one Inn, and that none of the mo&s;t inviting to Strangers neither.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cazerom</HI> to <HI>Schiras</HI> it is five days journey. The Road lyes over very craggy
<PB N="66" REF="47">
Mountains, which had been impa&s;&s;able, but for the Liberality of <HI>Ali Couli-Kan,</HI> Governour of <HI>Schiras.</HI> He made Ways where there were none before, and joyn'd Mountains together by Bridges, in Countries which otherwi&s;e had been inacce&s;&s;ible. In the mid&s;t of the Mountains is a wide gap or di&s;continuance, from whence a Plain extends it &s;elf of about twenty Leagues in circuit. It is inhabited by <HI>Jews</HI> only, who are Silk-Weavers. In the&s;e Mountains you met with Tents, where the <HI>Chalde|ans</HI> &s;ojourn, that come for cool Air and Pa&s;turage in the Summer.</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Schiras,</HI> I took Hor&s;e there for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which I arriv'd in nine days. The Country over which you travel, between the&s;e two Cities, is part Plains, part Mountains; part wild, and part manur'd. Three days journey from <HI>Schiras</HI> you pa&s;s the Mountain of <HI>Mayen,</HI> a little City where there is nothing worthy ob&s;erva|tion. Two days journey from thence you enter upon the Plains of the Province of <HI>Cu&s;cuzar,</HI> where the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> keeps his Race-Hor&s;es. The next day I arriv'd at <HI>Ye&s;decas,</HI> where the be&s;t Bread in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is made. This is a little City upon a Rock, wherein there is a very fair Inn: at the foot whereof runs a little River that glides into the Valley, wherein grows that excellent Corn which is utter'd in Bread from that City.</P>
<P>In three days I went from <HI>Ye&s;decas</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> This was the fir&s;t Road from <HI>A|leppo</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<P>I Departed from <HI>Paris</HI> in my third Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> upon the &s;ixth of <HI>December</HI> 1643, and went to <HI>Ligorn,</HI> where I found the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">h</HI> Fleet ready to &s;et Sail for the <HI>Levant.</HI> The Ve&s;&s;el wherein I embark'd &s;eeming&punc; rather a Man-of-War than a Merchant-Man.

Thereupon the Pirate gave us three Broad-&s;ides, that went over the Ship without doing us any harm: which we an&s;wer'd by as many from our Ship, the fir&s;t whereof brought his Fore-ma&s;t by the Board; and the third Shot went through the Fore-ca&s;tle and kill'd him &s;ome Men, as far as we could di&s;cern. At that very in&s;tant one of our Mariners cry'd out from the Top-ma&s;t-head, <HI>A Sail from the South.</HI> Thereupon the Pirate left us, and made Sail after her: and we, glad of &s;uch an e&s;cape, pur&s;u'd our Voyage to <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> where we happily arriv'd; from whence I took Hor&s;e for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> as I have already de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth of <HI>March</HI> I departed from <HI>Aleppo</HI> in the company of two <HI>Capuchin</HI> Friars, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> and Father <HI>Yves,</HI> and the <HI>Venetian</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Dominica de Sanctis.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Bir,</HI> where you cro&s;s the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> it is four days journey for the Hor&s;e-<HI>Caravan.</HI> The Country is well wooded, and well manur'd.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh of <HI>March</HI> the great Rains that fell hinder'd us from getting to the u&s;ual Stage, &s;o that we could not gain <HI>Telbechar,</HI> another Town, where there is no Inn: which con&s;train'd us to &s;top a League on this &s;ide, and to go to a Cave that was able to contain three hundred Hor&s;e. This is a Cave where the <HI>Bedouins</HI> or Feeders of Cattel thereabouts oft retire, who live after the manner of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> either in Rocks or in poor Hutts. The Cave has been hollow'd from time to time, there being &s;everal Niches in it like little Chambers. Our <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> fearing
<PB N="67" REF="47">
&s;ome <HI>Ambu&s;cade,</HI> rode thither before to view the place, but finding it empty and free, we re&s;ted there that night, and the next came to lye at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">zara,</HI> which is only a &s;mall Village without an Inn: Neither was there any thing remarkable upon that Road. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly that near the Cave, in the Mountain, there is very good Water: And formerly upon the Mountain &s;tood a Ca&s;tle, of which &s;ome ruines are &s;till re|maining. From the top of the Mountain there is a fair Pro&s;pect as far as you can &s;ee, over very fair Plains on every &s;ide, and in &s;everal places very good Land, water'd by divers Channels which are brought from the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI> All the Rivolets al&s;o that you cro&s;s from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Bir</HI> come from the &s;ame River.</P>
<P>The fourth day after we parted from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> being the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> we came to the banks of <HI>Euphrates. Bir</HI> is on the other &s;ide of the River; and becau&s;e that &s;ometimes the Goods cannot be unladen all in a day; their is a fair and large Inn, to defend the Merchants from the <HI>Bedo&uuml;ins,</HI> which would el&s;e di&s;turb and rob them, were not they and their Goods in that manner &s;ecur'd&punc;</P>
<P>You cro&s;s the <HI>Euphrates</HI> in large Ferry Boats, and as &s;oon as you are got over the other &s;ide of the River, the Cu&s;tomer and his Officers comes and tells the Bales, and writes down the names of the Merchants to whom they belong. The <HI>Caravan</HI> does not lye in the Town, which is built like an <HI>Amphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tre</HI> upon the brow of a very craggy Mountain, but pa&s;&s;es forward over a &s;curvy Road on an Inn upon the top of the Mountain. Near the Inn there are &s;everal Chambers cut out of the Rock, where they that cannot get room in the Inn are forc'd to lye. That Evening the Cu&s;tom-Officer comes to receive his duties, being two <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> upon e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ery load of Goods, whether upon Hor&s;e or Mule, though the Mules carry more than the Hor&s;es; and half a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> for every Bea&s;t that carries Provi&s;ions. But for Saddle Hor&s;es or Mules there is nothing demanded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bir,</HI> or <HI>Berygeon,</HI> as the Natives call it, is a large City for an Ea&s;tern City, &s;ituated upon the brow of a Hill. Below upon the River &s;tands a Ca&s;tle that de|clares its Antiquity; it is half as long as the City, but narrow, and without any other Fortification, &s;aving only a Tower that &s;cours the River, in which there are eight or nine pitiful Culverins. In the highe&s;t part of the Town &s;tands another Ca&s;tle where the Governour re&s;ides, who is an <HI>Aga,</HI> whom &s;ome call a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> having un|der him two hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and four hundred <HI>Spahi's.</HI> The City <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ill built&punc; as are the mo&s;t part of the Cities of <HI>Turkie:</HI> But there are an extrordinary plenty of all things, excellent Bread, good Wine, and great &s;tore of the be&s;t &s;ort of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The tenth day after we had travel'd elev'n hours in the fir&s;t Lands of <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia&punc;</HI> that lye between the two Rivers <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tigre,</HI> which at pre&s;ent they call <HI>Diarb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> we came in the evening to <HI>Sharmley.</HI> This is a very good Town, with a fair Inn, and Baths round about it. About twice Mu&s;quet-Shot from thence, &s;tands a Mountain alone by it &s;elf, like <HI>Montmartre</HI> near <HI>Paris:</HI> Round about it are Plains, and at the top of it &s;tands a Fortre&s;s, with a Garri&s;on of two hundred <HI>Spahi's,</HI> by rea&s;on that the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;ometimes cro&s;s <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and make incur&s;ions upon that &s;ide. In the year 1631, the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> returning from <HI>Bagdat,</HI> where he had lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Army, not being able to take the City; fearing the lo&s;s of his head if he return'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and knowing him&s;elf to be in great e&s;teem among the Souldiers, re&s;olv'd to quarter him&s;elf upon this Mountain, and to erect a Fortre&s;s to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the tempe&s;t that threaten'd him. No doubt but if he could have brought about his de&s;ign, he might have made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and would have put the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> to a great deal of trouble. For if you intend for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> whether it be from <HI>Tauris, Mo&s;&s;ul,</HI> or <HI>Bagdat,</HI> unle&s;s you travel thorough the De&s;ert, you mu&s;t pa&s;s through <HI>Sharmley,</HI> under the command of this Fortre&s;s, for Provi&s;ion and Wa|ters &s;ake. The work was gone &s;o far forward, that there was a good defence rais'd, and the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> had already enclos'd all the Mountain together with the Inn, with a Wall almo&s;t twenty foot thick, and three fathom high, when he was &s;trangl'd by tho&s;e in whom he mo&s;t confided, the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> having gain'd them either by threats or by rewards.</P>
<P>The eleventh, after a Journey of ten hours we came to <HI>Ourfa,</HI> where the <HI>Cara|van</HI> u&s;ually &s;tays eight or ten days; for here it is that they live that hire the Hor&s;es and the Mules, who have always &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in this place. We lay at an Inn
<PB N="68" REF="48">
three or four hundred paces di&s;tant from the City toward the North. When the Inn is full, the re&s;t retire into the <HI>Grotto's</HI> which are near at hand, and are very good quarters. Here the Toll-gatherer pre&s;ently comes and counts the Bales with|out op'ning them. They that carry any Sacks mu&s;t pay for half a Load; if not, he op'ns the Sack to &s;ee if there be any Merchandi&s;e therein, for then the Merchant mu&s;t pay the whole duty.</P>
<P><HI>Ourfa</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> built as they &s;ay, in the &s;ame place where <HI>Abraham</HI> liv'd, and where &s;tood the ancient <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;a,</HI> where the people of the Country report, that King <HI>Abdgarus</HI> generally kept his Court. There are &s;till to be &s;een the ruines of a Ca&s;tle; from whence they add, that the &s;ame King &s;ent to <HI>CHRIST</HI> for his Picture, and offer'd him his Kingdom and his people to defend him again&s;t the <HI>Jews;</HI> whom he under&s;tood to be his Enemies. The Chronicles of the <HI>Armenians</HI> report, that <HI>Abagarus</HI> was their Country-man, and that in his Reign they began to be Chri&s;tians, and to be Baptiz'd by the hands of an Apo&s;tle, whom <HI>CHRIST</HI> &s;ent to that Prince after his Re&s;urrection. Neither is this Ca&s;tle yet &s;o far ruin'd, but that there is &s;till to be &s;een a &s;pacious Hall, and three or four hand|&s;om Rooms with &s;ome relicks of Mo&s;aick work. I was curious to &s;ee what ever was remarkable in this City. And fir&s;t they led me to a large Fountain which re|&s;embles a Fi&s;h-pond, the Spring whereof is under the Foundations of the principal <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which was built in honour of <HI>Abraham.</HI> The Chri&s;tians of the Coun|try &s;ay, that it was in that place where he pray'd, before he went about to Sacri|fice his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and that two Springs of Water aro&s;e from the two places where he re&s;ted his knees, which now feed the large Fountain I have made mention of. It is pav'd with Free-&s;tone, and &s;o full of Fi&s;h, that if you throw them in a little Bread, they will follow you from place to place as you walk by the &s;ide of the Pond. There is no medling with them; for the <HI>Turks</HI> have a great veneration for tho&s;e Fi&s;h, which they call <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Fi&s;h. Be&s;ides that, the place about the Fountain where the water wid'ns it &s;elf to water all the City, is cover'd with very fair Carpets, for about twenty paces in bredth. This Fountain at length falls into a little River that runs by the Walls. As for the <HI>Grotto</HI> where the two Springs ri&s;e, there is no going into it before you have pull'd off your Shooes, and it is a great favour for a Chri&s;tian to &s;ee it; &s;uch a favour as co&s;t me &s;ix Pia&s;ters. I al&s;o &s;aw the Church, under the portal whereof, they &s;ay, St. <HI>Alexis</HI> liv'd &s;eventeen years a private life. It &s;tands in the middle of a Church-yard, in the highe&s;t part of the Town, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Armenians.</HI> But their principal Church is about a quarter of an hours walking from the City, built by St. <HI>Ephren,</HI> who is there buried. The Mona&s;tery &s;tands yet entire, enclos'd with fair Walls. In the Church I &s;aw a large Bible in <HI>Armenian</HI> Characters. The Sepulchre of St. <HI>Ephren</HI> is in a Cave at the foot of the Mountain, to which there al&s;o belongs a Chappel, where they keep three or four Lamps continually burning. There are other <HI>Grotto's</HI> up and down the Mountain, where are to be &s;een very ancient Sepulchers of the Chri&s;tians. The City of <HI>Ourfa</HI> is &s;eated in a good &s;oil, very well manur'd, which extends it &s;elf out of &s;ight to|ward the Ea&s;t. There are &s;everal plea&s;ant Gardens near the walls, water'd by little Channels brought thither by Art. The &s;oil produces good Wine, &s;o that a man may live as well at <HI>Ourfa,</HI> as in any part of <HI>Turkie.</HI> While I &s;tay'd there, I kill'd abundance of Feldfares in tho&s;e Gardens; and indeed there is great &s;tore of wild Fowl all the Country over. The Walls of the City are of Free&s;tone, with Battlements and Towers; but within, the hou&s;es are &s;mall, ill built, and ruinous: And there are &s;everal void &s;paces in the City, which makes <HI>Ourfa</HI> to look rather like a De&s;ert than a Metropolis. The City is Govern'd by a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who has under him a hundred and fifty <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and &s;ix hundred <HI>Spahi's,</HI> &s;tanding more in need of Cavalry than Infantry, by rea&s;on of the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> e&s;pecially in harve&s;t time. In &s;hort, <HI>Ourfa</HI> is the place where they dre&s;s &s;uch great quantities of Cordovan Skins, by rea&s;on of the waters particular to the Country, which give them that peculiar beauty. The Yellow Skins are dre&s;t at <HI>Ourfa,</HI> the Blew at <HI>Tocat,</HI> and the Red at <HI>Diarbequir.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> we &s;et out of <HI>Ourfa,</HI> and after a Journey of &s;ix hours, we lay at a pittiful Village where the Inn was fal'n all to decay. There is a Foun|tain of excellent water by it, which is all the convenience of the place, for there is no Provi&s;ion to be had.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="48">
The twenty-fir&s;t we travel'd nine hours, and came to lye near &s;everal Caverns which are very deep; at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntry whereof there are little Rooms, which are &s;up|pos'd to be the places where the People of the Country liv'd that fed their Cattel thereabouts. There is al&s;o Rain-Water to be had in &s;ome of the Concavities of the Rock. Half this days journey you mu&s;t pa&s;s over Rocks, where it is almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible, and very dangerous to keep your Hor&s;es back.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd, having travel'd elev'n hours, we lodg'd near a Cavern, having forded a River that runs at the foot of it. There are two great <HI>Grotto's</HI> on each &s;ide, where Travellers take up their Quarters, and whither the Natives of the Country bring Provi&s;ions both for Hor&s;e and Man. The Toll-gatherers, coming from a Fort about three Leagues di&s;tant from the&s;e Caverns, here exact two <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> and a half for every Hor&s;e and Mules Load; and &s;earch your Sacks, to &s;ee if there be no Merchantable Goods therein. About half the way of this days journey you meet with a City quite de&s;erted by the Inhabitants; and about an hours march after that, with Tombs of Stone, in the middle whereof &s;tands a Cro&s;s, with <HI>Armenian</HI> Cha|racters.</P>
<P>The twenty-third we travel'd elev'n hours, and lay at <HI>Dadacardin.</HI> This appears to have been a great Town, but is all ruin'd: nor is there any thing remaining but a long Stone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ridge very well built, under which runs a River that is very broad when it overflows. The People of the Country have no other Habitations than the Hollows of Rocks; yet they bring to the Travellers Hens, Butter, Chee&s;e, and other Provi&s;ions; which they &s;ell very cheap.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth we travel'd nine hours, and lay at a place call'd <HI>Cara,</HI> built upon a Hill. The <HI>Caravan</HI> lay at the Inn; but the two <HI>Capuchins</HI> and I lay at a private Chri&s;tian's Hou&s;e, who carry'd us to the Church, where was then the <HI>Ver|tabet</HI> or Bi&s;hop of <HI>Merdin.</HI> It was a pitiful poor Church, where they had nothing but two Planks &s;upported with four Sticks in&s;tead of an Altar&punc; They dare not leave any Furniture in it, but as &s;oon as the Prie&s;t has &s;aid Service, he mu&s;t have a care to take away every thing, as well the Planks as the Covering of the Altar, which was only a Painted Cloth: For the <HI>Turks</HI> that travel that way, if it be foul weather, will break open the Door, put their Hor&s;es there, burn the Altar, and take away whatever they find.</P>
<P>In the Village where we lay, there was a Pond, the &s;ides whereof were &s;ur|rounded with fair Free-&s;tones, which were fetch'd from the Chri&s;tian Churches, and the Tombs of the Chri&s;tians thereabouts. Among the re&s;t, there was one very large Stone, with an Epitaph upon it in large <HI>Latin</HI> Letters; whereby we knew it to be the Tomb-&s;tone of a <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman, who had been a Captain of Foot. The Bi&s;hop inform'd us, that it is recorded in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Stories, that the <HI>French</HI> were a long time in this Country, at what time the Chri&s;tians were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Syria.</HI> This Country is all a large Plain, about twenty Leagues in length; which might be well manur'd, and make the Inhabitants rich, did not the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> reduce them to the utmo&s;t degree of Poverty.</P>
<P>The twenty-fifth, after we had travel'd eight hours, we lay at a Village call'd <HI>Cou&s;a&s;ar,</HI> where there was no Inn. There were formerly three great Mona&s;teries, a quarter of a League one from the other. The <HI>Turks</HI> have ruin'd two, all but the Steeples of the Churches that belong'd to them. The third, which &s;tands all entire, and is the faire&s;t Pile of Building, &s;erves for a <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> They have made Shops round about the Cloy&s;ters, in the middle of which is a fair Spring of Water.</P>
<P>The twenty &s;eventh we lay &s;till at <HI>Cou&s;a&s;ar,</HI> being the place where you mu&s;t pay the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> which is not above two days journey off, amounting to two <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> and a fourth part, for every Load of Merchants Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Merdin</HI> is not above two Leagues from <HI>Cou&s;a&s;ar.</HI> This is a little City &s;eated upon a Mountain, with good Walls, and a fair Fountain repleni&s;h'd from the Ca&s;tle; which &s;tands upon the North-&s;ide, in a place yet higher, that commands the City; where there lives a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who has under him two hundred <HI>Spahi's,</HI> and four hun|dred <HI>Janizaries. Merdin</HI> is the place where was born the Lady <HI>Maani Gioerida,</HI> the fir&s;t Wife of <HI>Pietro de la Valle,</HI> &s;o well known for his famous Travels.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Cou&s;a&s;ar,</HI> which is a large Village, it is inhabited for the mo&s;t part by <HI>Ar|menian</HI> Chri&s;tians and <HI>Ne&s;torians.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> perform Divine Service in their own Language; the <HI>Ne&s;torians</HI> in the <HI>Chalda&iuml;c.</HI> The latter &s;hew'd me two Bibles
<PB N="70" REF="49">
in a large Volume, in the &s;ame Language, writt'n in Vellum, all the Capital Letters being in Gold and Azure. They &s;eem'd to be very old; and one of their Prie&s;ts told me, that it is 937 years ago &s;ince one of them was writt&punc;n; the other not above 374 &s;ince. When Service is done, they put them in a Che&s;t, and hide them under Ground. I would have giv'n 200 <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> for the olde&s;t, but they dur&s;t not &s;ell it, in regard it belong'd to the Church, and was not at their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh, after we had travel'd nine hours, we arriv'd at <HI>Kara&s;ara,</HI> which had been formerly a great Town, and no doubt inhabited by Chri&s;tians; as appears by &s;even or eight Churches half ruin'd, though the Steeples are little the wor&s;e. They &s;tand at a good di&s;tance one from the other; and upon the North&punc;&s;ide of one of tho&s;e Churches there is a Gallery, at the end whereof, through a little Door you de&s;cend about a hundred Steps, every Step being ten Inches thick. When you come under the Church, you meet with a larger and bigger Vault, &s;upported with Pillars. The Building is &s;o contriv'd, that there is more light below than in that above; but&punc; of late years the Earth has &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">p'd up &s;everal Windows. The great Altar is in the Rock; on the right &s;ide whereof is a Room, which receives the light from &s;everal Windows contriv'd in the Rock. Over the Gate of the Church was a great Free-&s;tone, wherein were certain Letters that I could not read. On the North-&s;ide of the &s;ame Church under Ground are to be &s;een two great Ci&s;terns, each four hundred and fifty Paces long; with two great Arches, &s;u&s;tain'd with &s;everal Pillars. Every year they fill them with the Water that falls from the next Mountain, and makes a kind of a River. A quarter of a League from the Church, you de&s;cend the Mountain for above a hundred Paces together among the Rocks, on each &s;ide whereof are Rooms cut out of the Rock. Upon every Door there is a Cro&s;s; and in every Room as it were a Bench, and a Table, with a little place about the length of a Man, like a Bed&s;ted, all cut out of the Rock. At the bottom of the Rock is a Hall, round about the Wall whereof is a Bench to &s;it on. The Roof is all plain, without any Arch; in the middle whereof there is a Hole to the top of the Moun|tain: but in regard it gives no light, 'tis very probable 'twas only made to let out the Smoak when they dre&s;t their Meat; or el&s;e to let in the fre&s;h Air, as I have &s;een in many Villages upon the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf. Upon the highe&s;t of tho&s;e Mountains &s;tands a paltry Village, where they buy their Victuals. But before the <HI>Caravan</HI> arrives, certain Merchants ride before to inform them&s;elves from the Herd&s;men, whether they know of any Thieves in the <HI>Grotto's,</HI> that often hide them&s;elves there in expectation of Prey.</P>
<P>In the year 1638, <HI>Sultan Amurat</HI> going to be&s;iege <HI>Babylon,</HI> march'd this very way, as well to &s;ee the&s;e Ruines, as to give order for the demoli&s;hing a Fort that &s;tood not above two Leagues off of <HI>Kara&s;era,</HI> which the Thieves of the Country made their place of retreat. He al&s;o at the &s;ame time caus'd the Road to be clear'd for four days journey, by ord'ring the Stones to be pickt up and laid in heaps, all along the Road. He al&s;o built a Bridge over the River. And indeed, that March of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> was very advantageous to all Travellers that pa&s;s this way.</P>
<P>The twenty-eight we travel'd eight hours, and came to <HI>Nesbin,</HI> anciently <HI>Ni|&s;ibis.</HI> Two or three hours travel on this &s;ide, near the Road, is a kind of Hermitage, being a &s;mall Room enclos'd with Walls, the Door whereof is &s;o low, that a Man mu&s;t creep upon his Belly to get in. Three or four <HI>Jews</HI> went and perform'd their Devotions at this Hermitage, believing it to be the place where the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> was buried.</P>
<P>The Country from <HI>Cou&s;a&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Nesbin</HI> is a large Plain, where for the fir&s;t days journey you &s;hall &s;ee no other green Herb upon the Ground but only Pimpernel; the Roots whereof are &s;o large, that there are &s;ome a Foot and a half in diameter. The next day, the Fields are cover'd with a large thick Leaf, the Root whereof is bulbous, and as big as an Egg. There are al&s;o great &s;tore of yellow, red, and violet Flowers, Tulips of &s;everal colours, Emonies, and &s;ingle Daffadillies. But in general <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> is a very barren Country, and there are very few places that can be better'd by Art or Indu&s;try.</P>
<P><HI>Nesbin</HI> is only the Shadow of the ancient <HI>Ni&s;ibis,</HI> being now only a large Village; the Inhabitants whereof are Chri&s;tians, both <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Ne&s;torians.</HI> Our <HI>Ca|ravan</HI> lodg'd a little beyond, in a Church-yard adjoyning to one of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Churches. The next day, hearing people &s;ing, I went to the Church with the two
<PB N="71" REF="49">
<HI>Capuchins,</HI> where I &s;aw an <HI>Armenian</HI> Bi&s;hop, with his Miter, and a wooden Cro&s;ier, accompany'd with &s;everal Prie&s;ts and a good Congregation. When Service was done, after &s;ome few Compliments between us, he led us down un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er the Church into a Chapel, where he &s;hew'd us the Sepulcher of St. <HI>James</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ni&s;ibis.</HI> In the Church-yard is a Stone about a Foot thick, and &s;ix high; upon which were laid &s;everal Candles of Wax and Tallow, which the Poor offer in their Nece&s;&s;ities, but e&s;pecially in their Sickne&s;&s;es. They believe that Stone to have been the Pede&s;tal for the Statue of &s;ome Saint, which the <HI>Turks</HI> have defac'd: &s;o that they give the &s;ame Honour to the Pede&s;tal, as they would have giv'n to the Statue. There arc al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Characters to be &s;een, but half worn out, and &s;paces brok'n off in &s;ome parts: &s;o that I could not learn, in Honour of whom that Statue was erected. Half a League from <HI>Nisbin</HI> runs a River, which you cro&s;s over a Stone-Bridge. In the way to the River are &s;everal pieces of Wall, with an Arch, which made me con|jecture, that formerly the City extended as far as the River.</P>
<P>Twice Musket-&s;hot from the River you meet with a Stone half buried, upon which are written certain <HI>Latin</HI> Words; whereby it appears that it was the Tomb|&s;tone of the General of an Army that was a <HI>French-man:</HI> but I could not read his Name, which time had defac'd. The &s;ame Bi&s;hop inform'd us, that formerly the <HI>Moors</HI> having be&s;ieg'd City, there came &s;uch a prodigious company of &s;trange Flyes, and did &s;o torment both Men and Hor&s;es, that they were forc'd to &s;trange the Siege. You mu&s;t pay the &s;ame Toll at <HI>Nisbin</HI> as in other places, that is, two <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> and a half for every Mule or Hor&s;es Load. We lay there three days toge|ther, to furni&s;h our &s;elves with Provi&s;ions 'till we came to <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> which is five days journey from <HI>Nisbin;</HI> the Country between being altogether de&s;ert and uninha|bited. There is no Water to be &s;ound but in two places, and that not very good neither; near to which you &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome few Herd&s;men grazing their Cattel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> we departed from <HI>Nisbin;</HI> and after we had travel'd eleven hours, we lay near to a River, whither certain Shepherds brought us Hens to &s;ell.</P>
<P>The &s;econd we travel'd ten hours, and lay at a paltry Town, where we met with nothing to eat.</P>
<P>The third we travel'd thirteen hours, and lodg'd by a pitiful Fountain, the Water whereof was hardly good enough for our Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The fourth we travel'd ten hours, and came to lodge by the Bank of a little River, near to which appear'd the Ruines of a Bridge and a Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The fifth we travel'd eleven hours, to reach <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> which is not far from the ancient <HI>Niniveh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mou&s;&s;ul</HI> is a City that makes a great &s;hew without, the Walls being of Free-&s;tone; but within it is almo&s;t all, ruin'd having only two blind Market-places, with a little Ca&s;tle upon the <HI>Tigris,</HI> where the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> lives. In a word, there is nothing worth a Man's &s;ight in <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> the place being only con&s;iderable for the great concour&s;e of Merchants; e&s;pecially the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Curds,</HI> which are the Inha|bitants of the ancient <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> now call'd <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> where there grows great plenty of Galls, and for which there is a great Trade. There are in it four &s;orts of Chri&s;tians, <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Ne&s;torians,</HI> and <HI>Maronites.</HI> The <HI>Capuchins</HI> had a pretty Dwelling upon the <HI>Tigris;</HI> but the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> laying a Fine upon them, becau&s;e they went about a little to enlarge it, they were for'd to quit it. The City is go|vern'd by a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> that has under him, part <HI>Janizaries,</HI> part <HI>Spahi's,</HI> about three thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>There are only two &s;curvy Inns in <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> which being full when we came, I caus'd my Tent to be &s;et up at the <HI>Meydan,</HI> or great Market-place.</P>
<P>Now to &s;ay &s;omething in general of the difference of the two Rivers, <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> in reference to their Cour&s;e and Waters: I ob&s;erv'd that the Water of <HI>Euphrates</HI> appear'd &s;omewhat red; and that the Stream was not &s;o &s;wift as that of <HI>Tigris,</HI> which &s;eem'd to be whiti&s;h, like the <HI>Loire.</HI> As for its Cour&s;e, <HI>Euphrates</HI> runs a far longer way than <HI>Tigris.</HI> But now let us cro&s;s the <HI>Tigris,</HI> over a Bridge of Boats, to view the &s;ad Ruines of a City that has made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the World; though there be now &s;carce any appearance of its ancient &s;plendour.</P>
<P><HI>Niniveh</HI> was built upon the left Shoar of the <HI>Tigris,</HI> upon <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>-&s;ide, being now only a heap of Rubbi&s;h extending almo&s;t a League along the River. There are
<PB N="72" REF="50">
abundance of Vaults and Caverns uninhabited; nor could a man well conjecture whether they were the ancient Habitations of the people, or whether any hou&s;es had been built upon them in former times; for mo&s;t of the hou&s;es in <HI>Turkie</HI> are like Cellars, or el&s;e but one Story high.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the Road from <HI>Nineveh</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> Together with the Story of an Amba&s;&s;ador, call'd <HI>Dominico de Santis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving pa&s;s'd the <HI>Tigris,</HI> we &s;tay'd three quarters of an hours Journey from <HI>Nineveh</HI> for &s;ome Merchants that were to go along with the <HI>Cara|van.</HI> The way which we took was not the u&s;ual Road to <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but it was a way wherein there were le&s;s Duties to be paid; and be&s;ides, it was a &s;hort cut, the <HI>Caravan</HI> making but fifty-eight days Journey between <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> From the very banks of the River to the place where we Lodg'd that Evening, we &s;aw nothing but continu'd Ruines, which makes me believe, it was the place where the ancient <HI>Nineveh</HI> &s;tood.</P>
<P>We &s;taid two days near the <HI>Mo&s;qu&eacute;e,</HI> where according to the tradition of the <HI>Turk, Jonas</HI> was bury'd, and made choice of a <HI>Curd,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;yrian,</HI> for our <HI>Cara|van-Ba&s;hi,</HI> though the people are generally Thieves, and mu&s;t be carefully look'd after. But it was a piece of Policy, becau&s;e we were to cro&s;s the ancient <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> now call'd <HI>Curdi&s;tan;</HI> the Language of which Country is a particular Speech.</P>
<P>In the two fir&s;t days Journey we cro&s;s'd two &s;mall Rivers that fall from the Moun|tains, and empty them&s;elves into <HI>Tigris.</HI> Our fir&s;t Journey was through a plain Country all along by the &s;ide of a little River; and the &s;econd Evening we lodg'd by the &s;ide of a great River that falls from the Mountains toward the North, and running to the South, di&s;charges it &s;elf into <HI>Tigris</HI> It is call'd <HI>Bohrus,</HI> being a very rapid Stream, full of Fi&s;h, but more e&s;pecially excellent Trouts. The <HI>Caravan</HI> was two days pa&s;&s;ing that River, by rea&s;on there were no Boats. For the people are forc'd to tye long Perches four five together one upon another, which the Natives call a <HI>Kilet.</HI> They make it four-&s;quare, and put underneath it about a hundred Goat-Skins full of wind, to the end the <HI>Kilet</HI> may not touch the water. Be&s;ides the Merchant mu&s;t be careful to &s;pread good &s;tore of thick Felts over the <HI>Kilet,</HI> of which he mu&s;t be provided to keep off the Water, le&s;t the Bales that &s;ink the <HI>Kilet</HI> &s;hould take wet. At the four corners are four Perches that &s;erve for Oars, though they avail but little again&s;t the force of the Tide; &s;o that you mu&s;t be forc'd to hale the <HI>Kilet</HI> four or five hundred Paces a'this &s;ide up the River, and then row down the Stream to the place where you intend to Land the Goods. When the Goods are Landed, the men are forc'd again to draw the <HI>Kilet</HI> by main &s;trength out of the water, to take away the Goat-Skins which are then to be lad'n upon the Mules appoin|ted to carry them. As for the Hor&s;es, Mules, and A&s;&s;es, as well tho&s;e that carri'd
<PB N="73" REF="50">
the Goods, as tho&s;e upon which the men ride; &s;o &s;oon as the Herd&s; men thereabout &s;ee a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ravan</HI> coming, they flock to the River-&s;ide. Tho&s;e people that wear nothing but a cour&s;e piece of Linen or a Goat-skin to cover their nakedne&s;s, take off their Cloaths and wind them about their Heads, like a Turbant. Then every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yes a Goat skin blow'd up under his Stomach; and then two or three of the mo&s;t expert mounting the &s;ame number of the be&s;t Hor&s;es, which are brid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d, put them&s;elves fir&s;t into the Water, while others follow them &s;wimming, and drive the Hor&s;es before them; holding the Bea&s;t by the Tayl with one hand, and &s;witching him with the other. If they find any Hor&s;e or A&s;s that is too weak, they tye a Goat-skin under his Belly to help him. Con&s;idering which difficulties, it cannot take up le&s;s time than I have mention'd to get over a <HI>Caravan</HI> of five or &s;ix hundred Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravan</HI> being thus got over, for two or three days has but a very bad Road. The fir&s;t days journey the Hor&s;es were continually in the Water up to the mid-leg; and the &s;econd, and part of the third we travel'd through a very de&s;ert Country, where we met with very little food for our Hor&s;es, and only a few Brakes to boy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Rice. Having got over this bad way, we came to a River call'd the great <HI>Zar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> over which we pa&s;s'd upon a Stone-Bridge of nine Arches. They report that this Bridge was built by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, in his March again&s;t <HI>Darius.</HI> A quarter of a League to the South&punc;Ea&s;t, two Rivers meet, which empty them&s;elves into <HI>Tigris.</HI> Lea|ving the Bridge, we came to a Town call'd <HI>Sherazoul,</HI> built upon a ri&s;ing Ground, upon three Redoubts. There re&s;ides a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who mu&s;t be brib'd with a &s;mall Pre&s;ent to let the <HI>Caravan</HI> pa&s;s; we lay by the Banks of a River, and &s;taid there two days. From thence we travel'd one days journey over dry Mountains, not finding any Water. But the next day we came into a plea&s;ant Plain, &s;tor'd with Fruit-trees. This was the Plain of <HI>Arbele,</HI> where <HI>Alexander</HI> defeated <HI>Darius;</HI> containing about fifteen Leagues in all. It is water'd with &s;everal Rivulets, and in the middle of the Mountain ri&s;es a little Hill about half a League in circuit. It is all over cover'd with the faire&s;t Oaks that ever were &s;een; and on the top are the Ruines of a Ca&s;tle, that &s;eems to have been a &s;umptuous Structure. The Country-people &s;ay that <HI>Darius</HI> &s;taid there while his Captains gave Battel to <HI>Alexander.</HI> Three Leagues from thence, near a great Mountain toward the North, are to be &s;een the Ruines of another Ca&s;tle and &s;everal Hou&s;es, where they add, that <HI>Darius</HI> &s;ecur'd &s;ome of his Wives when he lo&s;t the Battel. This Ca&s;tle is &s;eated in a mo&s;t lovely Pro&s;pect. At the foot o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Mountain ri&s;es a Spring, which a quarter of a League off &s;wells into a River that bears good big Boats. It runs winding about the Mountains to the Southward; &s;o that two days journey from the Hill, you cro&s;s it near a Town call'd <HI>Sherazoul,</HI> over a fair Stone-Bridge of nine Arches, whereof the Great <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> caus'd three to be brok'n down after he had tak'n <HI>Bagdat.</HI></P>
<P>This City of <HI>Sherazoul</HI> is built after another manner than any other of the Cities in tho&s;e parts, being all cut out of a &s;teep Rock for a quarter of a League together; &s;o that you mu&s;t go up to the Hou&s;es by Stairs of fifteen, or twenty &s;teps, &s;ome|times more, &s;ometimes le&s;s according to the &s;cituation of the place. The people have no other Doors to their Hou&s;es than only a thin round Stone, like a Mill &s;tone, which they will roll away when they go in or out, the &s;ides of the Wall being &s;o cut as to receive the Stone like a Ca&s;e, being level with the Rock.</P>
<P>The tops of their Hou&s;es are like Niches in the Mountain, where the Inhabi|tants have contriv'd Caves to keep their Cattel in: So that we judg'd it to be built for a place of &s;afety to &s;ecure the Inhabitants from the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Bedouins</HI> of <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI></P>
<P>We came to <HI>Sherazoul</HI> upon <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-Eve, and &s;taid there three days to refre&s;h our &s;elves, after a <HI>Lent</HI> which we had kept very &s;paringly. Here I found certain Springs that ro&s;e up in large Bubbles, which after I had mix'd with two Gla&s;&s;es of Wine and drank up, I found to have a Purgative quality, having a kind of Mineral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t. The&s;e Springs boyl up near the &s;ide of a River call'd <HI>Altun &s;ou,</HI> or, <HI>The River of Gold,</HI> that falls into the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> three days journey on this &s;ide <HI>Bagdat.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we lay at a pitiful Town, upon the Frontiers of <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, being the fifth after we &s;et out from <HI>Nineveh,</HI> we pa&s;s'd over
<PB N="74" REF="51">
&s;everal Fens and hot Waters, that part the two Empires. Entring thus into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> we met with a high Mountain cover'd with fair Oaks, which bear the Gall-Nuts, &s;o high, that the <HI>Caravan</HI> was &s;ome hours ere it could get to the top. As we a&s;cend|ed, but e&s;pecially when we were up, we heard &s;everal Muskets go off. At fir&s;t we thought the people had been hunting the wild Boars or Stags, of which the Moun|tains are full: but the report of the Guns being too loud and too thick for Hunters, we &s;tood upon our guard; and I believe we &s;hould have mended our paces, had we known what was intended us. Be&s;ides, I remember'd that the Country people would not &s;ell any thing but for Powder and Bullet, which the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> advis'd me not to let them have, for fear they &s;hould make u&s;e of it again&s;t our &s;elves. From the Mountain we de&s;cended into a fertil Plain, water'd with &s;everal Rivers; and night approaching, we &s;et up our Tents, not fearing any thing, becau&s;e we were in the Dominions of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where there is &s;o much &s;ecurity in travelling. After that we &s;ent our Servants to the Tents of the Country-men, but they brought us nothing but Bread made of Acorns, than which the poor people thereabouts eat no other. This Acorn is about the bigne&s;s of our Nuts; and once I met with a Branch that had thirty Acorns, and twenty-three Gall-Nuts, all at one time growing upon it.</P>
<P>The Province which we travel'd through then, compos'd the greate&s;t part of the ancient <HI>A&s;&s;yria.</HI> But now to come to the Story of <HI>Dominico de Santis</HI> the <HI>Venetian.</HI> He had Letters of Credence from the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and he went in the <HI>Caravan</HI> through the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Territories, never di&s;covering him&s;elf who he was; but coming into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he took upon him without fear the Title of Amba&s;&s;ador from the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>From the Plain where we lodg'd, it is two days journey to a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">g Town, to which belongs a Fortre&s;s, where the Governour of the Province has a Lieutenant, with about two thou&s;and Hor&s;e under his Command. The Fortre&s;s is upon the right hand toward the South, after three hours riding upon the High-way. To this Lieutenant, the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> was according to duty bound to give notice of the Arrival of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> and an account of the Per&s;ons and their Merchandize. This <HI>Venetian</HI> was a per&s;on ill fitted for the quality of an Amba&s;&s;ador, being a per&s;on of no Parts; which made me wonder that &s;uch great Princes, and &s;o wi&s;e a Commonwealth, &s;hould &s;end &s;uch a per&s;on upon a Concern of that importance. For the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> then a&s;&s;ailing <HI>Candy,</HI> he was &s;ent to excite the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to engage him in a War again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> thereby to keep off the Storm that threaten'd Chri&s;tendom. Thereupon I told the Amba&s;&s;ador, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to give the Commander of the Fort fir&s;t notice of his coming, to the end he might give advice thereof to <HI>Solyman Kan</HI> Governour of the Province, who&s;e duty it was to adverti&s;e the King. Thereupon he reque&s;ted me to &s;end my Inter|preter, which I did. Upon who&s;e intelligence the Lieutenant of the Fort came to Compliment the Amba&s;&s;ador on the behalf of the chief Commander, and to conduct him to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Amba&s;&s;ador, my &s;elf, and my Interpreter, together with &s;ome <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants went with him, travelling for three hours over the Mountains. By that time we came half the way, as we pa&s;s'd through a Wood, we heard as it were &s;ome per&s;on give a Whi&s;tle; at which when the Lieutenant perceiv'd us to be &s;omewhat &s;tartl'd, he carry'd us to the place from whence the Whi&s;tle came, where we &s;aw a Serpent about as big as a Man's Thigh, and about twelve Foot long, who&s;e head was &s;queez'd between two Trees, that put him to pain. From that Mountain we de&s;cended into a plea&s;ant Plain, where the Commander of the Fortre&s;s &s;taid for us under his Tent. He had &s;et it up by the &s;ide of a River, under the &s;hade of &s;everal great Walnut-trees. So &s;oon as he &s;aw us, he ro&s;e from his great Silk Tape&s;try Coverlet, and &s;aluted us in a mo&s;t civil manner, telling us, that a&s;&s;uredly <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> his Ma&s;ter, would be very glad to hear that the Monarchs of Chri&s;tendom had &s;ent him an Amba&s;&s;ador, and that be would write to <HI>Solyman Kan,</HI> who&s;e duty it was to adverti&s;e the Emperour. Thereupon he wrote and di&s;patch'd away a Me&s;&s;enger, giving him order to tell the <HI>Deroga,</HI> or Judge of the Town, through which we were to pa&s;s, that he &s;hould make Provi&s;ion for us and out Hor&s;es 'till we came to the Governour. After he had ask'd us &s;everal Que&s;tions
<PB N="75" REF="51">
concerning the War between the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> how many thou|&s;and men he had as well by Sea as Land, and what number of Galleys and Ships? wherein we &s;atisfy'd him according to the be&s;t of our knowledge. After he had civilly treated us, he &s;ent his Lieutenant back with us again to the <HI>Caravan.</HI> About ten a Clock the next night we di&s;lodg'd, and the Lieutenant and &s;ix Souldiers attended upon us&punc; who told us he had order not to leave us, 'till he had brought us to <HI>Solyman Kan.</HI></P>
<P>The next night we lodg'd between two Hills, among &s;everal Tents of Herds-men. Here it was that the Commander had order'd that we &s;hould be treatrd by the <HI>De|roga.</HI> A <HI>Deroga,</HI> as I have &s;aid, is the Judge of a Village: But this <HI>Deroga</HI> was chief of many Families, &s;ome of which were of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> others of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The&s;e are all Herd&s;men that never live in Hou&s;es, but retire with their Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tle to the holes in the Rocks, where partly Nature, partly Art, have contributed to make them convenient Habitations.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we were alighted, four ancient men came and led the Amba&s;&s;ador and my &s;elf to the <HI>Deroga</HI>'s Tent. It &s;eem'd to con&s;i&s;t of many Rooms, with a Hall in the middle, &s;pread with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpets. He caus'd us to &s;it down upon Cu&s;hions, and then pre&s;ented us with a Pipe of Tobacco, and Water to wa&s;h our Feet. Af|ter he had nobly treated us, and that we were upon taking our leaves, the <HI>Deroga</HI> was very much troubl'd that we had made a &s;mall Pre&s;ent to his Son; telling us, that it was a crime for him to take any thing of the King's Gue&s;ts, e&s;pecially from Strangers that had come &s;o long a Journey.</P>
<P>The next day we lodg'd in a place where there was &s;uch a prodigious quantity of Lillies that the Ground was almo&s;t cover'd with them. There were none that were white, being for the mo&s;t part of a fair Violet colour, with a &s;treak of Red in the middle of every leaf; they are like our Lillies, but much bigger. And to drink the infu&s;ion of the Roots of the&s;e Lillies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e Leaves are blacke&s;t, for fifteen days together, is a mo&s;t Sovereign remedy again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ox. Not long after came a Per&s;on of a goodly A&s;pect, who &s;eem'd to be an <HI>Arabian,</HI> but he &s;poke the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language, whom <HI>Solyman Kan</HI> had &s;ent to Compliment the Amba&s;&s;ador. He carry'd us to the Tent which the Governour had caus'd to be &s;et up in a Garden near the Town, where he al&s;o Lodg'd the <HI>Capuchins.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;a|dor al&s;o &s;ent to Compliment the <HI>Kan</HI> by my interpreter; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> when the hour was come that we were to &s;et forward, he gave order to &s;ix of the Captains of his Ca|valry to accompany the Amba&s;&s;ador. The Hou&s;e where the Governour liv'd in, was one of the mo&s;t beautiful in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> And as for the Governour him&s;elf, we found him in a Gallery that look'd upon the Garden, the Floor being all &s;pread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ver with Tape&s;try of Gold and Silk, with large Cu&s;hions of Cloth of Gold all along the Wall. After &s;ome Que&s;tions and di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> they &s;erv'd in Supper, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Di&s;hes; but no Wine was to be had; our drink being only Sherbet and the juice of Granates, with Sugar for tho&s;e that de&s;ir'd it. We were a long time at Supper, for 'tis the cu&s;tom of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> that when one man ri&s;es, another takes his place and falls too, in &s;o much that the Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t mu&s;t have the Patience to &s;tay 'till &s;everal have tak'n their turns; and when every one has done, the Cloth is tak'n away without any more to do. Here the Amba&s;&s;ador committed an ab&s;urdity; for there are no Silver or Gold Spoons in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but only long Wooden Ladles that reach a great way. Now the Amba&s;&s;a|dor reaching his Ladle to a Pur&s;lane-Di&s;h full of Pottage that was &s;calding hot, clap'd it pre&s;ently into his mouth; but finding it &s;o hot that he could not endure it, after &s;everal &s;curvy faces, he threw it out of his mouth again into his hand, in the pre&s;ence of all the Company.</P>
<P>After we had &s;tay'd five days at <HI>Sneirne,</HI> the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> &s;ignifi'd his de&s;ire to pur&s;ue his Journey. Thereupon the Amba&s;&s;ador took his leave of the Governour, pre&s;enting him with a Watch and a pair of Pi&s;tols; who in retaliation pre&s;ented the Amba&s;&s;ador with a &s;tately Hor&s;e, and a Colt of two years old. The next day we di&s;lodg'd, and&punc; pur&s;u'd our Road to <HI>Amadan,</HI> which is not above three days Journey from <HI>Sneirne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amadan</HI> is one&punc; of the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;eated at the foot of a Mountain, where do ari&s;e an infinite company of Springs that do water all the Country. The Land about it abounds in Corn and Rice, wherewith it furni&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

the greate&s;t part of the neighbouring Provinces. Which is the rea&s;on that &s;ome of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> State&s;men hold it very inconvenient for the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to keep <HI>Bagdat,</HI> as well by rea&s;on of the va&s;tne&s;s of the Charge, as al&s;o for that it draws from <HI>Amadan</HI> that which &s;hould &s;upply other Provinces. On the other &s;ide, it is ea&s;ie for the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> to hold it, by rea&s;on of the neighbourhood of <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia, A&s;&s;yria,</HI> and the <HI>Arabs,</HI> Enemies to the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> by which means Provi|&s;ions are very cheap, which the people would not know where to put off, if the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were Lord of <HI>Bagdat.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;taid at <HI>Amadan</HI> about ten days, by rea&s;on of the Rains; during which time the <HI>Caravans</HI> cannot travel. While we tarry'd there, we were vi&s;ited by &s;everal <HI>Babylonian</HI> Chri&s;tians, who were glad to &s;ee that we had e&s;cap'd the Clutches of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> who had giv'n order to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Karkou,</HI> and the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Sharaffou</HI> that commands the Frontiers of <HI>Turkie,</HI> to &s;eize us, and carry us back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>Bagdat.</HI> For which we might have thank'd the Amba&s;&s;ador, and a malicious <HI>Rabbi,</HI> that came along with us in the <HI>Caravan</HI> from <HI>Aleppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</HI> who finding the Fea&s;t of the Tabernacles to be at hand, and that we had a great way to <HI>I&s;pahan&punc;</HI> left us at <HI>Ni|niveh,</HI> to keep the Fe&s;tival with the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Where that he might in&s;i|nuate him&s;elf into the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s favour, he inform'd him that there was a <HI>Fringuiz</HI> in the <HI>Garavan,</HI> whom he look'd upon as a Spy, and that he was an Envoy into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice;</HI> for he carry'd no Merchandize, but had three Che&s;ts full of rich Habits, and &s;everal other things, which he took for Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King. For out of vanity or folly, the <HI>Venetian</HI> had &s;everal times open'd his Che&s;t and expos'd his Gallantry to view. And yet he was &s;o clutch-fi&s;ted and niggardly in every thing, that when there was any occa&s;ion to reward the <HI>Kan</HI>'s Ser|vant, or any of the Country-men that brought us the Dainties of the place, it came all out of my Pocket. So that I left him to my Interpreter and the two <HI>Capuchins;</HI> and with three Servants and a Guide, after I had &s;taid at <HI>Amadan</HI> three days, I took Hor&s;e for <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>When I came there, the <HI>Nazar</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the King's Hou&s;hold hearing I had left an Amba&s;&s;ador behind me with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> enquir'd of me what manner of Per&s;on he was, but I pretended I had but little conver&s;e with him, unwilling to di&s;cover his mean Spirit. The Evening before his Arrival the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent to give the <HI>Fringuiz</HI> notice in the King's Name, that they &s;hould be ready to go meet the Amba&s;&s;ador the next day; which we did, and brought him into the City and through <HI>Ali</HI>'s Gate, that joyns to the King's Palace. Now 'tis the cu&s;tome for all Amba&s;&s;adours to &s;alute that Gate, by rea&s;on of a white Marble Stone made like an A&s;&s;es back, and which &s;erves for a Step: being, as they report, brought an|ciently out of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where <HI>Ali</HI> liv'd. So &s;oon as you have &s;trid over that Stone without touching it, which were a great crime, you enter into a kind of a Gallery, where there are Rooms on each &s;ide, which &s;erve for a Sanctuary for Criminals, which the King him&s;elf cannot fetch out of that place. That day that the new King receives his En&s;igns of Royalty, he goes to &s;tride over that Stone; and if by negli|gence he &s;hould chance to touch it, there are four Guards at the Gate, that would make a &s;hew of thru&s;ting him back again.</P>
<P>But now the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies being ready to conduct the Amba&s;&s;ador to the Apartment alotted him, as an Amba&s;&s;ador that came from three great Mo|narchs, and a potent Commonwealth, he de&s;ir'd to lodge at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Pietro Pentalet,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Venetian</HI> Parents; whereupon the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies conducted him thither, and caus'd his Dinner to be brought him. While we were eating, I counted thirteen Languages &s;poken at the Table; <HI>Latin, French, High-Dutch, Engli&s;h, Low-Dutch, Italian, Portuguez, Per&s;ian, Turki&s;h, Arabic, Indian, Syriac,</HI> and <HI>Malaye,</HI> which is the Language of the Learned, that is &s;poken from the River <HI>Indus</HI> to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> and in all the I&s;lands of the Ea&s;t, like <HI>Latin</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI> not reck'ning the little <HI>More&s;co</HI> or Gibbri&s;h of the Country. So that it is a difficult thing to ob&s;erve what is talk'd in one Company, where the Di&s;cour&s;e begins in one Language, is pur&s;u'd in another, and fini&s;h'd in a third: and for the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> they never &s;peak above three or four Languages at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Now to &s;hew you the Civility of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies came to the Amba&s;&s;ador and told him, that if he did not like the Cookery of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he had Order from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> who is as the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> in <HI>Turkie,</HI> to offer him
<PB N="77" REF="52">
Money in&s;tead of Diet, to the end he might dre&s;s his own Meat as he pleas'd him|&s;elf. Upon which the covetous Amba&s;&s;adour accepted his offer, and two hours after there was a Bag brought him of 50 <HI>Tomans.</HI> which amount to about 800 Crowns. The <HI>Franks</HI> being offended at his ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;lighted the Amba&s;&s;ador, and left him to keep Hou&s;e by him&s;elf, which was poor enough God knows; an Onion or A Turnep &s;erving his turn for a Meal. Some days after, he had audience of the King, to whom he pre&s;ented his Letters Credential from the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice.</HI> Tho&s;e from the three la&s;t were well receiv'd, becau&s;e the Seals were of Gold, and for that the Paper was embeli&s;h'd with curious Flouri&s;hes; but the Pope's Letters were rejected with &s;corn becau&s;e the Seals were only of Lead, as the Bulls are u&s;ually &s;eal'd; and for that the Writing was very plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; For the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who are very nice, love things that are gay to the Eye; otherwi&s;e they look upon them&s;elves to be affronted. <HI>Dominico de Santis</HI> had better have taken upon him the meaner quality of an Envoy, than the title of an Amba&s;&s;ador, unle&s;s he had known better how to behave him&s;elf; e&s;pecially being &s;o eclips'd as he was by a real Amba&s;&s;ador that arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;ome time after. All the <HI>Franks</HI> went forth to meet him, and the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies made him the &s;ame proffers as he had done to the <HI>Venetian:</HI> but he nobly an&s;wer'd, That what|ever it were that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent him, he &s;hould take it for a very great Honour: otherwi&s;e, if he would have eaten Gold, the King his Ma&s;ter would have allow'd him 30 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">les Load. Such per&s;ons as behave them&s;elves with decency and at good grace, are the per&s;ons that the Chri&s;tian Princes &s;hould &s;end into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who are the mo&s;t refin'd Wits, and the be&s;t Politicians of all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude the Story of the <HI>Venetian,</HI> I will give you his Character. An <HI>Indian</HI> naturally of a good Wit having embrac'd Chri&s;tianity and an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Life, went to <HI>Rome</HI> to compleat his Studies which he had begun at <HI>Goa;</HI> whether, the Pope, taking an affection to him, &s;ent him afterward as his Vicar. <HI>Dominico de Santis</HI> being&punc; then at <HI>Rome,</HI> put him&s;elf into his &s;ervice, and follow'd him into the <HI>Indies,</HI> where I &s;aw him the fir&s;t time I went, in a mean condition. Upon his return to <HI>Venice,</HI> where he was in no credit before, he made people believe that he under&s;tood the Trade of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> whereupon &s;ome particular Merchants tru&s;ted him with &s;ome Goods, which were ca&s;t away at <HI>Seide.</HI> Thus poor and bare he return'd to <HI>Goa,</HI> where he got 800 Crowns by a charitable Contribution. From thence he travel'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he fell into the acquaintance of Father <HI>Rigordi</HI> a Je&s;uite, with whom he went into <HI>Poland:</HI> where making his brags of the great knowledge he had of the Affairs of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the King gave him that Commi&s;&s;ion which I have already mention'd. The Emperour follow'd his Example, and the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI> did the &s;ame: and to give the more lu&s;tre and authority to his Emba&s;&s;y, they got the Pope to joyn with them. But alas! both <HI>Dominico de Santis,</HI> and all &s;uch per&s;ons as he, that go into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> without Brains and good Behaviour, do but pro&s;titute the Reputation of the Princes that &s;end them. Such another was Father <HI>Rigordi,</HI> who after he had been thru&s;t out of <HI>Goa</HI> by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> went to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he in&s;inuated him&s;elf by a Propo&s;ition which he made of Marrying the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who was then a very young Prince, to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Orleance.</HI> Under which pretence he was well receiv'd and treated by the King; from whom he al&s;o receiv'd &s;ome Pre&s;ents by virtue of that Propo&s;al, which was good &s;port to the Dutche&s;s when &s;he heard of it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Venetian,</HI> the <HI>Atemadoulet,</HI> who was very glad to be rid of him, de&s;ir'd the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who was then upon his return home, to take him along with him, which he did as far as the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, where they take Shipping for <HI>A&s;tracan;</HI> but there the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> told him he could carry him no further: thereupon he was forc'd to come back to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and &s;o to travel to <HI>Goa,</HI> whence the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;hipt him home for Charities &s;ake. But when he came to <HI>Venice,</HI> he was &s;o far from being well receiv'd, that the Senate had like to have puni&s;h'd him &s;everely for giving &s;o bad an account of his Negotiation.</P>

<P>I Set out from <HI>Paris</HI> in the company of Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' Ardiliere</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>June,</HI> 1651. and arriv'd at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>July.</HI> On the twenty-&s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we &s;et Sail, with a favourable North-We&s;t Wind that blew very briskly the two next days; but at length it grew &s;o very &s;lack, that coming about to the North North-Ea&s;t, we made for <HI>Sardinia.</HI> Upon the &s;econd of <HI>September</HI> by Sun&punc;ri&s;ing, we di&s;cover'd the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> &s;ix Leagues from the Land. About Noon the Wind chopping about again to the North We&s;t, we held on our fir&s;t Cour&s;e; and upon the third of <HI>September,</HI> we de&s;cry'd the I&s;land <HI>Galita</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> On the fourth we di&s;cover'd the I&s;land of <HI>Zambino</HI> before <HI>Tunis,</HI> and about Evening <HI>Cape Bon,</HI> which is the mo&s;t Southerly Point of all <HI>Africa.</HI> The fifth we had a &s;ight o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the I&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of <HI>Pantalaria,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sicily.</HI> The &s;ixth we di&s;cover'd the I&s;land of <HI>Goza,</HI> and the &s;eventh the Ca&s;tle that bears the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>We landed at <HI>Malta</HI> upon the day of the Nativity of the Virgin, which is a great day among the <HI>Malte&s;i,</HI> upon which they give thanks to God, for that the <HI>Turks</HI> rais'd their Siege upon that day.</P>
<P>The Grand Ma&s;ter goes to the Church of St. <HI>John,</HI> accompanied with all the chief Commanders in their Robes of Command, and the greate&s;t part of the Knights. All the Country-men and Citizens are up in Arms upon that day, and march to the Inn call'd the <HI>Auvernian&punc;hou&s;e,</HI> with the Knight that goes to fetch the Standard. This Knight is clad in a Ca&s;&s;ock of Crim&s;on Velvet, with a Cro&s;s of the Order, be|fore and behind. He wears a Helmet upon his head, and carries the Standard upon his &s;houlders; and by him marches the Grand-Ma&s;ter's Page, who carries a Sword in one hand, and a Dagger in the other, both very richly Embelli&s;h'd, and giv'n the the Order by <HI>CHARLES</HI> the fifth. The Page that carry'd the Sword and Dagger was the younge&s;t Nephew of Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the tenth. The Souldiers and Ci|tizens marching before to the Church door make a Lane for the Knight and the Page to pa&s;s on to the Altar, where the Knight makes three bows, and having done as much to the Grand-Ma&s;ter, places him&s;elf on the right hand of the Grand-Ma&s;ters Chair, and the Page on the le&s;t. Then the Ma&s;s and the Mu&s;ick begins, and while the Go&s;pel is reading, the Grand-Ma&s;ter takes the Sword and the Dagger out of the Page's hand, and holds them with the points upward all the remaining part of the Ma&s;s. During the Elevation of the Ho&s;t, the Knights repeats the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Ceremony as at the beginning; and then the Bells ring, the great Guns go off, and the Soul|diers give three Vollies. Ma&s;s being ended, the Grand-Ma&s;ter retires, accom|pany'd as before, only that he is then attended by all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons of the City, and coming out of the Church, he proceeds with all the Infantry marching before him toward our <HI>Lady's of Victory,</HI> where they all go in proce&s;&s;ion. While they make a &s;tand in that place, the Souldiers give another Volley, which is an|&s;wer'd by all the Canons in the Town, as al&s;o from the Ships and Galleys. After that they return to St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and the Infantry Guard the Standard back to the Inn, while the Grand-Ma&s;ter goes to his Palace.</P>
<P>The ninth we view'd the Fortifications, which are &s;tor'd with very fair pieces of Canon.</P>
<P>The tenth we &s;aw the Pages perform their Exerci&s;es before the Grand-Ma&s;ter, which are generally vaulting and handling their Arms, both Mu&s;quet and Pike.</P>
<P>The elev'nth we view'd the Ar&s;enal, where I was a&s;&s;ur'd that there were Arms for twenty thou&s;and men, being in good order, and rarely well look'd after.</P>

The twentieth we &s;et Sail, having the Wind at We&s;t-South-We&s;t, and a fre&s;h gale; &s;o that upon the twenty-third we di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Morea,</HI> to which we approach'd &s;o near, as to de&s;cry <HI>Navarin.</HI> In the Evening we &s;aw the City of <HI>Coron,</HI> where there is a great Trade for Sallet-Oyl.

<P>The twenty-fourth the Wind was at Ea&s;t&punc;North-Ea&s;t. In the Morning we di&s;co|ver'd the Cape of <HI>Matapan,</HI> which is the mo&s;t Southern Point of Land in <HI>Europe,</HI> lying in the <HI>Morea,</HI> and at Noon the I&s;land of <HI>Chergigo.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-fifth we drew near <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and de&s;cry'd a Mountain in that I&s;land call'd <HI>Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">liere,</HI> with &s;ome other Promontories toward the South.</P>
<P>From the twenty-&s;eventh day 'till we came to <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> we perceiv'd the Sea to be all over cover'd with Pumice-&s;tones, which happen'd from an Earth|quake that had for &s;ome time before &s;wallow'd up the I&s;land of <HI>Santorini.</HI> Some think that it proceeded from the abundance of Sulphur, of which that Country is full, which took Fire, and was the death of above 750 of the I&s;landers, that were partly buried in the Ruines, and partly dy'd out of fear. They that remain'd alive became black like Charcoal; and the Vapours that a&s;cended out of the Aby&s;s &s;ully'd all the Silver as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> the noi&s;e of the Earthquake being heard as far as <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-ninth by break of day we di&s;cover'd the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> by eight in the Morning we came to an Anchor before <HI>Salines,</HI> which is one of the Ports of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where our Con&s;uls live. Here I ask'd &s;everal of the Chri&s;tians of the Country, how they did to live and pay their <HI>Carage?</HI> Who told me that it was with a great deal of difficulty, in regard the I&s;land was very bare of Money; which was the rea&s;on that many Chri&s;tians turn'd <HI>Mahometans,</HI> to avoid paying their <HI>Carage,</HI> which is a Tribute that the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> lays upon all Chri&s;tians throughout his Dominions. He exacts from the poore&s;t fix <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> a Head; but there are &s;ome that pay a hundred, or a hundred and fifty: and this Tribute is due &s;o &s;oon as ever they come to be eighteen years of age.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus</HI> is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the Mediterranean Sea, more to the Ea&s;t than any of the re&s;t; bearing the title of a Kingdom, as being 500 Miles in circuit. It is not all of the &s;ame bredth, being of a triangular form, the &s;ides whereof are very unequal. To it there belong &s;everal Capes or Promon|tories, the principal whereof are St. <HI>Epiphanio,</HI> toward the We&s;t; Cape <HI>de Gate,</HI> toward the South; Cape <HI>Diegrega,</HI> toward the North-Ea&s;t; Cape <HI>Cormachiti,</HI> toward the North; and Cape St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> upon the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Point of the I&s;land. The principal Roads are that of <HI>Salines</HI> or <HI>Larneca,</HI> that of <HI>Paphos,</HI> and that of <HI>Cerines</HI> or <HI>Cerigni.</HI> The Haven of <HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> &s;ignifies nothing as to great Ships, there being none but &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els that can ride there. The <HI>Venetians</HI> had formerly made a &s;mall Mole there to harbour their Gallies; but it is now quite ruin'd. The Road of <HI>Cerines</HI> is that where the Barks and Galliots lye that come from <HI>Caramania,</HI> and <HI>Paya&s;&s;es;</HI> and where the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> land that are &s;ent as Governours of the I&s;land from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who re&s;ide generally at <HI>Nico&s;ia.</HI> That City is almo&s;t in the middle of the I&s;land, and was formerly a very large one, as appears by the compa&s;s of the ancient Walls. The new Walls are well terra&s;s'd within-&s;ide, and in a good po&s;ture of defence. There are three Gates belong to the City; that of <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> that of <HI>Paphos,</HI> and that of <HI>Cerines.</HI> The City it &s;elf is no uncomely place; the <HI>Venetians</HI> having adorn'd it with many fair Palaces, which the <HI>Turks</HI> demoli&s;h every day, out of hopes to find hidd'n Trea&s;ure therein, and &s;ell the Stones to build new Hou&s;es. The Cathedral that goes by the name of <HI>Santa Sophia</HI> is an ample and fair Structure, of which the <HI>Turks</HI> have now made a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> together with one more, which was formerly a Mona&s;tery belonging to the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>&punc;Fryars. The <HI>Greeks</HI> have there four Churches, and the <HI>Franks</HI> two; that is to &s;ay, the <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and the <HI>Italian</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Soccolans.</HI> The fir&s;t have a Church didicated to St. <HI>James,</HI> the others another, which is call'd <HI>Holy Rood Church.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> al&s;o have another belonging to them, which is a very neat Building, which was formerly a Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians.</HI> There it is that there is a Tomb, adorn'd with &s;everal Sculptures of Religious Nuns, e&s;pecially an Abbe&s;s with a Cro&s;s in her Hand, the Writing about the Stone being in <HI>French</HI> Characters.

<P><HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> is a Sea-Town upon the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, and the chief Bulwark of it. It is kept in good repair, the Ca&s;tle within being in form of a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ttadel. The <HI>Turks</HI> have converted into <HI>Mo&s;quees</HI> the Churches of the Chri&s;tians, who are not &s;uffer'd to dwell in the City. They have only the liberty to come thither in the day, and to open Shops, which they &s;hut up again at night, and then go home to their Hou&s;es in the neighbouring Villages. The City is govern'd by a <HI>Bey,</HI> who has no depen|dence upon the Governour of the I&s;land, who is oblig'd to maintain a Galley for the guard of the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Cerines</HI> is another little City, but without any defence, the Walls thereof being all tumbl'd to ruine. Only there is a Fortre&s;s toward the Sea, well built, with a Garri&s;on in it. There is al&s;o a hand&s;om Mona&s;tery of Religious <HI>Greeks,</HI> built &s;omewhat after the <HI>French</HI> manner; wherein there are &s;ome of the Cells which &s;tand &s;o upon the Sea, that they can fi&s;h out of the Windows. The Fields about it bear Cotton, which is the chief Revenue of the Mona&s;tery. There is only the Fort of <HI>Cerines</HI> upon the North, where the I&s;land does not lye &s;o open as toward the South and Ea&s;t; which be&s;ides by that of <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> are guarded by the Forts of <HI>Salines, Limi&s;&s;o,</HI> and <HI>Paphos.</HI> The Inhabitants of the I&s;land are for the mo&s;t part <HI>Greeks,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Villages. They are clad after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, both Men and Women; the Men wearing Hats like the <HI>Franks,</HI> and retaining their ancient Cu&s;toms as much as is po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ible for them to do. The Trade of the I&s;land lyes in Cotton wool, which is the be&s;t in all the Ea&s;t; and &s;ome Silk, which is neither good, nor very plentiful. However the I&s;land is fertil enough, did it not want In|habitants enough to till it. As for Bread, Wine, Chee&s;e, and Milk, they are all very cheap, and there is Oyl enough to &s;erve the I&s;land. But for the Wine, it is tran&s;|ported out of the I&s;land to all the places of Trade not far di&s;tant. The be&s;t grows at the foot of <HI>Olympus,</HI> and is a delicious fort of Drink. The Country between <HI>Nico&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> produces Cotton, of which there grows al&s;o &s;ome between <HI>Paphos</HI> and <HI>Limi&s;&s;o.</HI> The chief place where the Silk is made is call'd <HI>Cytherea,</HI> a large Town water'd with a fair River that runs from the Mountain of <HI>Venus.</HI> The River turns &s;everal Mills, which are the chief Revenue of the I&s;land. There is Silk al&s;o made between <HI>Paphos</HI> and <HI>Limi&s;&s;o;</HI> upon the Road between which two places you meet with a Town call'd <HI>Pi&s;copi,</HI> where are to be &s;een &s;everal Aquaeducts, that carry'd the Water into the Rooms and Magazines were the people formerly made Sugar. But &s;ince the I&s;land was tak'n from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> one of the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> that was &s;ent as Governour, burnt up all the Sugar-Canes in the Country. Toward the Sea &s;hoar near <HI>Limi&s;&s;o,</HI> is to be &s;een one of the faire&s;t Gardens of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> which they call <HI>Shiti;</HI> to which there belongs a magnificent Hou&s;e, and a Grove of Orange-Trees. It was built by a rich <HI>Venetian,</HI> who had a good E&s;tate in Lands there|abouts.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cpprus</HI> the people take a va&s;t number of Birds as big as a Lark, e&s;pecially near the <HI>Mountain of the Holy Cro&s;s.</HI> In the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> the Country-people of the adjacent Villages make them&s;elves little Hut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the Fields, where u&s;ually tho&s;e Birds are wont to light, and feed upon the Seed of an Herb that grows there; which when it is dry, the people daub over with Lime twigs. But this they never do but when the North-We&s;t Wind blows, and that the weather be very cold; for with a Southerly Wind they never take any. The&s;e Birds are ac|counted great Dainties by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who make no great Fea&s;ts in <HI>Carnival</HI>-time wherein they do not &s;et the&s;e Birds upon the Table, pil'd up in Di&s;hes like a Pyramid. They buy them up every year; being fir&s;t prepar'd fit for exportation by the people, who having pull'd off their Feathers, parboyl them, and pickle them up in Barrels with Vinegar and Salt. When they are to be eat'n, they are &s;et upon a Cha&s;ing di&s;h, between two Di&s;hes. Sometimes there are above a thou&s;and Barrels exported out of the I&s;land; and indeed, were it not for this Trade, the poor people would &s;ee but very little Money.</P>
<P>Upon the Mountain of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s</HI> &s;tands a Church of the &s;ame name; upon
<PB N="81" REF="54">
which the report of the Country goes, that St. <HI>Helena</HI> returning from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> left a piece of our Saviour's Cro&s;s with the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> who built a Church there, by means of the Liberality of the &s;ame Prince&s;s. Afterwards tho&s;e of the Town of <HI>Leucara</HI> took it from hence, and carry'd it to their Church, where I &s;aw it. The piece is as big as the Palm of a Man's Hand, &s;et in a great Cro&s;s of Latten, embo&s;s'd with &s;everal Figures.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Cyprus</HI> that there is an Archbi&s;hop, and three Suffragans. The Archbi&s;hop takes upon him the Title of <HI>Nico&s;ia;</HI> to which <HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> belongs with all the Country between <HI>Nico&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> with the Territories of <HI>Nico&s;ia</HI> and all the Villages round. He has a Hou&s;e about a League from <HI>Nico&s;ia,</HI> where the chiefe&s;t of his Revenue lies. Some years &s;ince he caus'd the high Altar of the Church to be painted and guilded, being a neat piece of Workman&s;hip. Thus the Archbi&s;hop has under his Juri&s;diction all the middle part of the I&s;land, and &s;ome part toward the Ea&s;t. The Bi&s;hops are the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Paphos, Larneca,</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rines.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> are very much addicted to the ob&s;ervation of their ancient Cu&s;toms and Ceremonies; and generally their Ma&s;&s;es are very long. Upon Sundays and Holy-days they ri&s;e between one and two of the Clock in the Morning to &s;ing Mat|tens. To which purpo&s;e there is a Clerk that goes from door to door and knocks with a Hammer, to wake the people, and then cries out with a loud voice, <HI>Chri|&s;tians go to Church.</HI> The men and old women fail not to go as being more zealous; but the maids and young women never go out of doors in the night for fear of the <HI>Turks.</HI> There are &s;even or eight Villages, the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">habitants whereof are <HI>Maronites,</HI> who came from Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> and &s;peak <HI>Arabic</HI> at home, but <HI>Greek</HI> among the I&s;landers. They follow the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion, and have their Churches peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus</HI> is no whole&s;om Air, being &s;ubject to the &s;poil of a &s;ort of Locu&s;ts, that &s;ome Summers de&s;troy all their Fruit and Corn During the heats they hover in the Air, which they will darken with their number like a thick Cloud; but when the North Wind blows, it carry's them into the Sea, where they peri&s;h.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Cyprus</HI> three &s;orts of colour'd Earth, a Grey black, a Red, and a Yellow; of which the <HI>Venetians</HI> fetch away great quantities for their cour&s;er &s;ort of Painting. There's al&s;o a Mine of White Alome, which is the &s;tone call'd <HI>Dami|antlius.</HI> 'Tis thought that the Ancients had a way to &s;pin this Alome into a kind of Cotton, and &s;o to make out of it a certain &s;ort of Cloath that would not con&s;ume in the Fire, but only be the more perfectly whiten'd thereby. The <HI>Indians</HI> formerly bury'd the dead bodies of their Kings deceas'd in Shrouds of this kind of Linen, and then putting them into the Fire, found the bodies all reduc'd to a&s;hes, but the Cloth whole; out of which they took the a&s;hes, and carefully put them into an Urne, which was prepared for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Cyprus</HI> has a mind to view the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> he &s;ends to give the <HI>Bey,</HI> who is Governour thereof, notice of it. For it is at the Gover|nours choice whether he will give him admi&s;&s;ion or no. The <HI>Ba&s;ha Hali-Giorgi,</HI> being a comely old man of above a hundred and two years of age, &s;etting out of <HI>Nico&s;ia</HI> in his Litter with about two hundred Hor&s;e, when he was come within half a League of <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> the Governour of the place &s;ent his Lieutenant with a hundred Hor&s;e to Compliment him, and to conduct him to the Town. Immediately they took upon them the Guard of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Litter, who was not permitted to tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> along with him above eight or ten of his principal Officers. The Canons roar'd at his entry, and he was treated magnificently, but he lay not in the Town, be|ing conducted back by the &s;ame party to the place where they met him in the Morning.</P>
<P>Upon the third day of <HI>October</HI> we &s;et Sail about three a Clock in the Morning with a We&s;t-North-We&s;t Wind, and about Noon we were within &s;ight of <HI>Famago&s;ta,</HI> into which place we could by no means be admitted, by rea&s;on of the Wars be|tween the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Venetians.</HI> But as far as I could di&s;cern a far off, there is no ea&s;ie acce&s;s to the Port, and for the City I could de&s;cry no part of it.</P>
<P>The fourth by break of day we got &s;ight of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Syria,</HI> Cape <HI>Canger,</HI> and the Gold of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and about Evening we arriv'd in the Rood of <HI>Alex|andretta.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the Road which the Author kept in the Fourth Voyage into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and particularly of his pa&s;&s;age upon the <HI>Tigris</HI> from <HI>Nineveh</HI> to <HI>Babylon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fifteenth of <HI>February</HI> we put off from <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul,</HI> and after we had &s;wam &s;ix hours, we came to lye near a hot Bath, about a Musket-&s;hot from the <HI>Tigris.</HI> It was throng'd with Sick people that came thither for their Recovery. We kept our &s;elves upon the Watch all night; but for all we could do, the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;tole two Coverlets from a Merchant, and a <HI>Turk's</HI> Cloaths that was gone into the Bath.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth, after we had row'd about five hours, we came to a huge Dam; it is 200 Foot wide, and makes a fall in the River of about 20 Fathoms &s;teep. The <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;aid that <HI>Alexand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> the Great made it to turn the cour&s;e of the River; others will have it, that <HI>Darius</HI> caus'd it to be made to hinder the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Ma|cedonians</HI> by Water. However, we were forc'd to land our &s;elves and our Goods, and to lade them upon Hor&s;es which the <HI>Arabs</HI> brought us.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ing this Dam is worthy ob&s;ervation. For it is a thing of wonder to &s;ee the <HI>Kilet</HI> all of a &s;udden fall above &s;ix&s;core Foot, and yet to be kept by the Leather-Bottles &s;till above Water. The Water-men that guide the Boat, tye them|&s;elves and their Oars fa&s;t to a Pearch bent like a Semicircle, to defend them&s;elves from the force of the Water. And indeed this is the Dam that renders <HI>Tigris</HI> un|navigable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kilet</HI> being come to the place where we expected it, we put our Goods aboard, and lay in the &s;ame place upon the Bank of the River. For the <HI>Arabs,</HI> if they perceive the Merchants a&s;leep, cut the Cords of the <HI>Kilet,</HI> and &s;etting it a drift, &s;wim after it, and rifle away what they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth, after three hours rowing we met with the River <HI>Zab,</HI> that empties into the <HI>Tigris,</HI> upon <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aldea</HI>&punc;&s;ide. Half a League above the River &s;tands a fair Ca&s;tle of Brick upon a little Hill; but no body dwelling in it, it runs to ruine. We were twelve hours that day upon the Water, and came to lye at a place which was full of Wood, where we made great Fires, and &s;hot off our Muskets often in the night to &s;care the Lions.</P>
<P>The eighteenth we were upon the Water eighteen hours, and lay upon the Bank of the River, upon <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>-&s;ide. That Evening the <HI>Arabs</HI> brought us Milk-Meats, and fre&s;h Butter. They &s;wim from the other &s;ide of the River with a <HI>Boracho</HI> under their Stomachs, and another upon their Heads, wherein they bring their Commo|dities; for which they will have no Money, but only Tobacco, or Bisket, or Pepper.</P>
<P>The nineteenth, in four hours time we met with a River call'd <HI>Altum-&s;ou,</HI> or <HI>The River of Gold.</HI> It flows from the Mountains of the <HI>Medes,</HI> and I travel'd by the &s;ide of it for threee days together, returning from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Tigris</HI> to <HI>Me&s;ia.</HI> The Water of the River is of an excellent ta&s;t, and it falls into <HI>Tigris</HI> upon <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>-&s;ide. All along the <HI>Tigris,</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ide, are great &s;tore of Bituminous Springs, and other Streams of hot Water that &s;mell of Sulphur. All that
<PB N="83" REF="55">
day we &s;aw none but <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Curds</HI> marching along the Banks of the River, the <HI>Curds</HI> upon <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> &s;ide, and the <HI>Araebs</HI> upon <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> &s;ide. They were at War, and both &s;ides march'd in very good order. The Young men went formo&s;t with Bows and Arrows, and &s;ome Muskets, but &s;everal Half-Pikes. Next to them their Wives, Virgins, and Children, with their Cattel, Herds, and Camels; after which march'd the Old men in the rear. As well the <HI>Curds</HI> as the <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;ent out Hor&s;e-men to &s;cout upon the high Grounds; for as &s;oon as they find any advantage, they pre&s;ent|ly &s;wim their Hor&s;es over the River and &s;all on. Now becau&s;e we would not tru&s;t tho&s;e &s;ort of People, we row'd nineteen hours to avoid 'em.</P>
<P>The twentieth we were eleven hours upon the <HI>Tigris,</HI> and came to lye at a Town call'd <HI>Tigris,</HI> upon <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> &s;ide. There belongs to the Town a Ca&s;tle half ruin'd, and yet there are &s;till &s;ome hand&s;om Chambers to be &s;een. Upon the North and Ea&s;t, the River &s;erves for a Moat; but upon the We&s;t and South it has a deep Artificial one pav'd with Free-&s;tone. The <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;ay that formerly it was the &s;tronge&s;t place in all <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> though it be commanded by two Hills not far from it. The Chri&s;tians dwelt half a League from the City, where the Ruines of a Church and part of a Steeple are &s;till to be &s;een, whereby it appears to have been a a con&s;iderable Pile of Building.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t, after we had row'd three hours, we met with a Town upon <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> &s;ide, which was call'd <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t-el-tour,</HI> from the name of a per&s;on that lyes inter'd in a Mona&s;tery, whom the people account to be a Saint. Therefore is it a place of great Devotion among them, &s;o that great numbers of Votaries go thither in private. That day we were twelve hours upon the Water, and lay upon the Banks of the River.</P>
<P>The twenty &s;econd, having been upon the Waters two hours, we met with a great Chanel cut ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Tigris</HI> to water the Lands, which runs up as far as ju&s;t over|again&s;t <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and there falls into the <HI>Tigris</HI> again. Coming thither, we landed upon <HI>Chaldea</HI> &s;ide, by rea&s;on that there were certain <HI>Turks</HI> with us, who would of nece&s;&s;ity perform their Devotions at a place call'd <HI>Samatra.</HI> In the &s;ame there is a <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> not above half a League from the River; to which many <HI>Mahometans</HI> pay their Devoirs, e&s;pecially <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who believe forty of their Pro|phets to be buried there. When they knew us to be Chri&s;tians, they would not permit us, no not for Money, to &s;et our Feet in it. About five hundred Paces from the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> &s;tands a Tower very ingeniou&s;ly built. There are two Stair-ca&s;es without, that belong to it, made twirling like a Periwinkle-&s;hell: one of which Stair-ca&s;es was built deeper into the Tower than the other. I would have taken better notice of it, could I have been permitted to have come nearer it. Only I ob&s;erv'd that it was made of Brick, and that it &s;eems to be very ancient. Half a League from thence appear three great Portals, that look as if they had been the Gates of &s;ome great Palace. And indeed it is not improbable but that there was &s;ome great City thereabouts; for, three Leagues all along the River there is nothing to be &s;een but Ruines. We were twelve hours that day upon the Water, and lay upon the Banks of <HI>Tigris,</HI> according to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The twenty-third, we were twenty hours upon the Water, and all the day long we &s;aw nothing upon either &s;ide of the River but pitiful Hutts made of the Branches of Palm-trees, where live certain poor people that turn the Wheels, by means whereof they water the neighbouring Grounds. We al&s;o met that day with a River call'd <HI>Odoine,</HI> that falls into <HI>Tigris</HI> upon the &s;ide of the ancient <HI>Chaldea.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-fourth, we were twenty two hours upon the Water together, never &s;tirring off from the <HI>Kilet.</HI> The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the Merchants having tak'n out o&s; the <HI>Kilet,</HI> all their Money and the be&s;t part of their Merchandizes, give them to the Country people&punc; who carry them very faithfully to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> whither they to &s;ell their own Commodities: which the Merchants do, to avoid the payment of Five in the Hundred, in the City. I tru&s;ted them al&s;o with &s;everal things of which they gave me a very good account, as they did to others, being contended with a &s;mall matter for their pains.</P>
<P>The twenty-fifth, about four of the Clock in the Morning we arriv'd at <HI>Bagdat,</HI> which is as u&s;ually call'd <HI>Babylon.</HI> They open the Gates by &s;ix, and then the Cu&s;tomers come to take an account of the Merchandize, and to &s;earch the Merchants them&s;elves. If they find nothing about 'em, they let the Merchants go: but if
<PB N="84" REF="56">
they have any thing about 'em which ought to pay, they carry the per&s;ons to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, where they write down the quantity of the Goods, and let them go. All the Merchandize upon the <HI>Kilet</HI> is carry'd thither al&s;o, which the Mer|chant fetches away again in two or three days, paying the Cu&s;tom: All which is done in very great order, without any noi&s;e or di&s;turbance in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Bagdat</HI> u&s;ually bear the name of <HI>Babylon,</HI> yet it is at a great di&s;tance from the ancient <HI>Babylon,</HI> whereof in due place. But now for <HI>Bagdat,</HI> as it &s;tands at this day.</P>
<P><HI>Bagdat</HI> is a City &s;eated upon the River of <HI>Tigris,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;e|parated from <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> by the &s;ame River. It lyes in 33 Deg. 15 Min. of Ele|vation. The Chronicles of the <HI>Arabians</HI> report that it was built by one of their <HI>Cali&s;fs</HI> nam'd <HI>Alman&s;our,</HI> in the year of the <HI>Hegyra</HI> of <HI>Mahomet</HI> 145, and of Chri&s;tianity 762, or thereabouts. They call it <HI>Dar-al-&s;ani,</HI> that is, the <HI>Hou&s;e of Peace.</HI> Some &s;ay it deriv'd its name from a Hermitage that &s;tood in a Meadow where the City now &s;tands, whence it was call'd <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or, a <HI>Garden bequeath'd.</HI> About forty years ago digging up the Foundations of an Inn, the Work-men found a Body entire, habited like a Bi&s;hop, with a Cen&s;or and Incen&s;e by him. And in the &s;ame place &s;everal Cells of Religious Hou&s;es &s;hew'd them&s;elves: which makes it very probable, that where <HI>Bagdat</HI> is built there was anciently a great Mona&s;tery, with &s;everal Hou&s;es where the Chri&s;tians inhabited. The City is about fifteen hun|dred Paces long, and &s;ev'n or eight hundred broad, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be above three Miles in circuit. The Walls are of Brick, and terra&s;s'd in &s;ome places, with large Towers like Ba&s;tions. Upon all the&s;e Towers there are mounted about &s;ixty pieces of Cannon, the bigge&s;t whereof carries not above a five or &s;ix Pound Ball. The Moats are wide, and about five or &s;ix Fathom deep. There are not above four Gates; three upon the Land-&s;ide, and one upon the River, which you mu&s;t cro&s;s, over a Bridge of thirty-three Boats, di&s;tant one from the other about the bredth of one Boat. The Ca&s;tle is in the City, near to one of the Gates call'd <HI>El-Maazan,</HI> upon the North &s;ide. It is partly built upon the River, encompa&s;s'd only with a &s;ingle Wall, terra&s;s'd in &s;ome places; and adorn'd with little Towers, upon which are planted about a hundred and fifty Cannon, but without Carriages. The Moat is narrow, and not above two or three Fathom deep, neither is there any Draw-Bridge before the Gate. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of three hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> commanded by an <HI>Aga.</HI> The City is govern'd by a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who is generally a <HI>Vizier.</HI> His Hou&s;e is upon the &s;ide of the River, making a fair &s;hew; and he has always ready at com|mand &s;ix or &s;even hundred Hor&s;e. There is al&s;o an <HI>Aga</HI> that commands three or four hundred <HI>Spahi's.</HI> They have be&s;ides another fort of Cavalry which is call'd <HI>Gin|guliler,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Men of Courage,</HI> commanded by two <HI>Aga's;</HI> and u&s;ually there are about three thou&s;and in the City and the Towns adjoyning. The Keys of the Gates of the City and the Bridge-Gate are in the cu&s;tody of another <HI>Aga,</HI> who has under him two hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ix hundred Foot men, who have their particular <HI>Aga,</HI> and about &s;ixty Cannoneers, who were at that time commanded by an expert Arti&s;t that went by the name of <HI>Signor Micha&euml;l,</HI> who pa&s;s'd for a <HI>Turk,</HI> though he were born in <HI>Candy.</HI> He put him&s;elf into the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s &s;ervice, when he went to be&s;iege <HI>Bagdat,</HI> in the year 1638. Though the <HI>Turk</HI> had the good fortune to carry the City in a &s;mall time; not &s;o much by virtue of the Breach which <HI>Signor Micha&euml;l</HI> had made in the Wall, as the Sedition and Revolt that happen'd at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the Story whereof was thus in &s;hort.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kan</HI> that &s;u&s;tain'd the brunt of the Siege at fir&s;t, was originally an <HI>Armenian,</HI> and his name was <HI>Sefi-couli&punc;Kan.</HI> He had commanded the City a long time, and had defended it twice from the Army of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were not able to take it before. But the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> having &s;ent one of his Favourites to command in his room, who had enter'd upon his Command before the Cannon had made the Breach, the old <HI>Kan</HI> finding him&s;elf di&s;plac'd by the Commi&s;&s;ion of the new Governour, rather cho&s;e to dye, than &s;urvive the Affront which was put upon him. To which purpo&s;e he &s;ent for his Servants, the Officers of the Army, his Wife and Son&punc; and taking three Cups of Poy&s;on in his Hand, he commanded his Wife, if ever &s;he lov'd him, now to &s;hew the marks of her affection by generou&s;ly dying with him. He gave the &s;ame exhortation to his Son; and &s;o all three together drank up the Poy&s;on, which procur'd their &s;peedy death. The Souldiers, who had a great love for their Governour,

For &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Turks</HI> were got into the City, the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> told the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> that to weak'n the force of the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to put to the Sword all the Souldiers that were in the City: and thereupon there were above twenty thou&s;and ma&s;&s;acr'd in cold Blood. The <HI>Turks</HI> had &s;eiz'd upon the <HI>Capuchins</HI> Man&s;ion, but <HI>Signor Micha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> chief of the Canonneers, got it to be re&s;tor'd them again.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Government of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> there is none but a <HI>Cady,</HI> who does all, acting even the <HI>Mu&s;ti,</HI> with a <HI>Skiekela&s;ton</HI> or <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> who receives the Revenues of the Grand <HI>Signor.</HI> There are in it five <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> of which two are indifferently well built, and adorn'd with <HI>Duomo's</HI> cover'd with varni&s;h'd Tiles of different colours. There are al&s;o ten Inns, all ill built, except two, which are rea&s;onably convenient. In general, the City is ill built; there being nothing of beauty in it but the <HI>Bazars,</HI> which are all arch'd; el&s;e the Merchants would not be able to endure the heats. They mu&s;t al&s;o be water'd three or four times a day; for which office &s;everal poor people are hir'd upon the publick charge. The City is full of Trade, but not &s;o full as it was, when in the hands of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> for when the <HI>Turk</HI> took it, he kill'd mo&s;t of the riche&s;t Merchants. However there is a great confluence thither from all Parts; whither for Trade, or for Devotions &s;ake, I cannot tell: becau&s;e they that follow the Sect of <HI>Haly,</HI> do believe that <HI>Haly</HI> liv'd at <HI>Bagdat.</HI> Be&s;ides, all they that are de&s;irous to go to <HI>Mecca</HI> by Land, mu&s;t pa&s;s through <HI>Bagdat,</HI> where every Pilgrim is forc'd to pay four <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> to the <HI>Ba&s;ha.</HI> You mu&s;t take notice that there are in <HI>Bagdat</HI> two &s;orts of <HI>Mahometans,</HI> the fir&s;t are call'd <HI>Rafedi's,</HI> or Here|ticks; the &s;econd, Ob&s;ervers of the Law, in all things like tho&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The <HI>Rafedi's</HI> will by no means eat or drink with a Chri&s;tian, and very hardly with the re&s;t of the <HI>Mahometans:</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> if they do happen to drink out of the &s;ame Cup, or to touch them, they pre&s;ently wa&s;h them&s;elves, as believing them&s;elves unclean. The others are not &s;o &s;crupulous, but eat and drink and conver&s;e with all the World. In the year 1639, after the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> had tak'n <HI>Bagdat,</HI> a <HI>Rafedi</HI> who was a Carrier of Water not only refus'd to give a <HI>Jew</HI> to drink, who de&s;ir'd it of him in the Market-place, but abus'd him al&s;o in words. Thereupon the <HI>Jew</HI> com|plain'd to the <HI>Cady,</HI> who immediately &s;ent for him, and caus'd his <HI>Boracho</HI> and his Cup to be brought along with him; when he came before him, he ask'd for his Cup, and gave the <HI>Jew</HI> to drink, and then made the Porter drink al&s;o out of the &s;ame Cup: After that, he order'd the <HI>Rafedi</HI> to be Ba&s;tinado'd, and this Le&s;&s;on to be taught him while he was cha&s;ti&s;ing, That we are God's Creatures, as well <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as Chri&s;tians and <HI>Jews.</HI> This has made them le&s;s zealous in their Super&s;tition, though they are the chiefe&s;t part of the Inhabitants of the City.</P>
<P>As to their Funerals, I have particularly ob&s;erv'd, that when the Husband dyes, the Wife pulls of all her Head&punc;gear, and lets her Hair fall about her Ears; then &s;he all be&s;mears her Face with the Soot of a Kettle, and having &s;o done, frisks and leaps about after &s;uch a ridiculous manner, as from others would rather produce laughter than tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s. All the kindred, friends and neighbours meet at the Hou&s;e of the deceas'd, and &s;tay for the Celebration of the Funeral. At what time the Wo|men &s;trive to out-vie one another in a thou&s;and Api&s;h tricks, clapping their Cheeks, yelling like mad people; and then of a &s;udden &s;etting them&s;elves to dance to the &s;ound of two Drums, like tho&s;e which the Tabor-and-Pipe&punc;men carry, upon which the Women beat for a quarter of an hour. Among them there is one more ac|cu&s;tom'd to this fool'ry than the re&s;t, that fills your Ears with mournful Dinns; to which other Women make an&s;wer, by redoubling their Cries, which may be heard at a great di&s;tance. It would then be a vain thing to &s;eek to comfort the Children of the deceas'd; for they &s;eem to be &s;o much be&s;ide them&s;elves, that they are not in a condition to hear any thing. And they are oblig'd to carry them&s;elves in that manner, unle&s;s they intend to run the reproach of not having any kindne&s;s for their Parents. When the Corps is carry'd to the Grave, abundance of poor people go before with Banners, and Cre&s;cents at the ends of Sticks, &s;inging mo&s;t di&s;mal Dirges all the way. The Women are not to be at the Interment, who are not
<PB N="86" REF="57">
to go abroad but only upon Thur&s;days, when they go to the Sepulchers to Pray for the Dead. And becau&s;e that by their Law the Husband is&punc; oblig'd to lye with his lawful Wife upon Thur&s;day-night or Fryday-night, upon Wedne&s;day-morning the Women go to the Baths, where they perfume their Heads and Bodies with a &s;weet Water. They may go abroad &s;ometimes at the other &s;ea&s;ons, when their Husbands give them leave to vi&s;it their Kindred; but then they are to be wrapt up from Head to Foot, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for their Husbands them&s;elves to know them if they meet 'em i'the Streets. By the way take notice, that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Women, unle&s;s they be &s;uch as are very poor, would rather &s;tay within all the days of their Lives, than go abroad without a Hor&s;e. And it is a certain &s;ign to know a Curti&s;an from an hone&s;t Woman; for that the Curti&s;ans put their Feet in the Stirup, and the hone&s;t Women only in the Stirup-leathers. The Women of <HI>Bagdat</HI> are very richly habited, after their fa&s;hions; but they are not contented to wear their Jewels about their Necks and Wri&s;ts, for they hang them like Bracelets about their Faces, and will bore holes in their Ears to put in a Ring. The <HI>Arabian</HI> Women only bore the &s;eparation between the two No&s;trils, where they wear hollow Rings, as well to &s;pare co&s;t as for lightne&s;s; for &s;ome are &s;o big, that you may almo&s;t thru&s;t your Fi&s;t through them. Beyond all this, the more to beautifie them&s;elves, they make a round Ring about their Eyes with a certain &s;ort of Blacking: And as well Men as Women, in the De&s;ert, put the &s;ame near their Eyes, to pre&s;erve them, as they &s;ay, from the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>Of Chri&s;tians there are three &s;orts: <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> who have a Church; <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who have none, but go the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> who admini&s;ter the Sacra|ments to them. The Chri&s;tians go in Devotion to a Chappel, about a &s;hort quarter of a League from the City, dedicated to a Saint whom they call <HI>Keder-Elias,</HI> paying a &s;mall Fee, for admi&s;&s;ion, to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who keep the Keys. Two days journey from the City &s;tands another ruin'd Church in a pitiful Village, where they &s;ay, that St. <HI>Simon</HI> and St. <HI>Jude</HI> were both Martyr'd and Buried. If a Chri&s;tian dyes, all the re&s;t come to his Burial, and returning home, find a Supper prepar'd to welcome them; the next day they return to the Grave, and pray for the deceas'd; and the third day there is a Dinner for all comers and goers. Sometimes there will be a hundred and fifty per&s;ons at a Burial. They repeat the &s;ame Ceremonies for the &s;eventh, fifteenth, thirtieth and fortieth days afterwards; having a great veneration for the Dead, for whom they pray too often. This cu&s;tom of Fea&s;ting is very in|convenient for the Poor; for they being de&s;irous to imitate the Rich, run them&s;elves &s;ometimes &s;o far in Debt, that they are forc'd to &s;ell their Children to the <HI>Turks</HI> to di&s;charge them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal <HI>Jews</HI> al&s;o in <HI>Bagdat,</HI> but more that come every year in Devotion to vi&s;it the Sepulcher of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> which is a day and a halfs journey from the City. In &s;hort, &s;ince the taking of <HI>Bagdat</HI> by <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> the number of Inhabitants cannot be le&s;s then fifteen thou&s;and Souls; which &s;hews that the City is not peopl'd according to its bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>About a day and a halfs journey from the Point of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> at di&s;tance almo&s;t equal between <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> there appears a va&s;t Heap of Earth, which the people call to this day <HI>Nemrod.</HI> It &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a wide Plain, and may be di&s;cover'd a great way off. The vulgar &s;ort believe it to be the Remains of the Tower of <HI>Babel;</HI> but there is more probability of the <HI>Arabians</HI> Opinion, who call it <HI>Agartouf,</HI> and believe it to have been built by an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, who always kept a Beacon at the top to a&s;&s;emble his Subjects together in time of War. This Heap of Earth was about three hundred Paces in circuit; but it is not ea&s;ie to gue&s;s at the ancient height, the re&s;t being fall'n to ruine, but &punc;only eighteen or twenty Fathom. It is built of Brick dry'd in the Sun, every Brick being ten Inches &s;quare, and three thick. The Building is thus rais'd. Upon every row of Canes or Reeds bruis'd to pieces and mix'd with Wheat-&s;traw, and &s;pread an Inch and a half thick, lye &s;even orders of the&s;e Bricks with a little Straw between each; then another Bed of Reeds, and &s;ix rows of Bricks; then a third with five rows, decrea&s;ing in that manner 'till you come to the top. The form of it &s;eems to have been rather &s;quare than round; and in the highe&s;t part of that which remains there appears a Hole like a Window; if it were not rather an Out-let for Water, or a Hole for the Scaffolding.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the Road from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara;</HI> and of the Religion of the Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>John.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fifteenth of <HI>March</HI> we hir'd a Bark from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> And we ob&s;erv'd, that a little beyond <HI>Bagdat</HI> the River <HI>Tigris</HI> divides it &s;elf into two Arms; the one which runs through the ancient <HI>Chaldea,</HI> the other keeps its cour&s;e towards the Point of <HI>Me&s;opotamia;</HI> the&s;e two Arms making a large I&s;land, cro&s;s'd by &s;everal &s;mall Chanels.</P>
<P>When we came to the place where <HI>Tigris</HI> divides it &s;elf, we beheld as it were the compa&s;s of a City that might have formerly been a large League in circuit. There are &s;ome of the Walls yet &s;tanding, upon which &s;ix Coaches may go a&punc;bre&s;t. They are made of burnt Brick, every Brick being ten Foot &s;quare, and three thick. The Chronicles of the Country &s;ay, that the&s;e were the Ruines of the ancient <HI>Ba|bylon.</HI></P>
<P>We follow'd that Arm of <HI>Tigris</HI> that runs along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chaldea;</HI> for fear of falling into the hands of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who were then at War with the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> denying to pay the ordinary Tribute to the Grand <HI>Signor.</HI> We were ten days upon the Water in our pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and lay every night upon the Water, dre&s;&s;ing our Victuals in the Bark. For when we came to any Villages, we &s;ent our Servants a &s;hoar to buy Provi&s;ions, which we had very cheap. Now the Towns we met with upon the Shoar were the&s;e&punc; <HI>Amurat,</HI> where there &s;tood a Fort of Brick bak'd in the Sun; <HI>Man&s;oury,</HI> a great Town&punc; <HI>Magar, Gazer,</HI> and <HI>Gorno.</HI> At this la&s;t place <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tigris</HI> meet together: where are al&s;o three Ca&s;tles to be &s;een; one upon the Point where the two Rivers meet, which is the &s;tronge&s;t, and were the Son of the Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> then commanded; the &s;econd upon <HI>Chaldea</HI> &s;ide; and the third upon <HI>Arabia</HI> &s;ide. Though the Cu&s;toms be there exactly demanded, and paid, yet they never &s;earch any per&s;on. The Tides come up to that place: &s;o that having but fifteen Leagues to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> we got thither in &s;ev'n hours, having both Wind and Tide.</P>
<P>All the Country between <HI>Bagdat</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> is inter-cut and parted by Dikes, like the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> the two Cities lying a hundred and &s;ixty Leagues one from
<PB N="88" REF="59">
the other. It is one of the be&s;t countries in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> being &s;tor'd with large Meadows and excellent Pa&s;turage, where are bred infinite numbers of Bea&s;ts, e&s;pecially Mares and Bufalo's. The Female Bufalo's go twelve Months, and yield &s;o much milk, that there are &s;ome that will give two and twenty Pints. And there is &s;o large a quantity of Butter made, that in &s;ome Vil|lages upon the <HI>Tigris,</HI> we &s;aw &s;ometimes five and twenty, &s;ometimes twenty Barks lad'n with Butter, which the people &s;ell all along the Gulf of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as well upon <HI>Arabia,</HI> as <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>Half the way betwixt <HI>Bagdat</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> we perceiv'd &s;everal Pavilions &s;et up in the Meadows along by the &s;ide of the River. Upon enquiry we heard that the <HI>Tefierdar</HI> was come from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to gather the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s duty's. For from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Gorno,</HI> for all the Bufalo's as well Male as Female, there is to be paid a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> and a quarter for every head once a year; which is worth yearly to the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> a hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI> Every Mare al&s;o pays two <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> every Sheep ten <HI>Sous;</HI> which if the Country people were not very cunning would be worth fifty thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> more than it is.</P>
<P>After this we came to <HI>Gorno,</HI> a Fortre&s;s upon the point where the two Rivers meet, be&s;ides two other &s;mall Ca&s;tles upon each &s;ide, &s;o that there is no pa&s;&s;ing without leave. Upon the Fort of <HI>Gorno,</HI> which was well furni&s;h'd with Cannon, we &s;aw the Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI>'s Son, who was Governour of the Fort. And here it is that the Account of the Cu&s;toms is taken. But though they are very exact in &s;earching the Barks, they are very civil, for they &s;earch no body. However le&s;t any Goods &s;hould be hid between the Planks of the Ships, over which they generally throw Fagots and Canes, the Cu&s;tomers bring a great Piercer, with which they bore the &s;ides of the Bark quite through for the di&s;covery of conceal'd Goods. The Goods are Regi&s;ter'd at <HI>Gorno,</HI> but the Cu&s;toms are always paid at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> according to the accompt giv'n from the Fort.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day entring into the Chanel that is cut out of <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> we met the chief of the <HI>Holland</HI> Factory taking his plea&s;ure in a Boat cover'd with Scarlet, who took me with him to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> &s;tands upon the &s;ide of <HI>Arabia de&s;erta,</HI> two Leagues from the Ruines of a City, which was formerly call'd <HI>Beredon,</HI> and anciently &s;tood in the De&s;ert, to which the Water was formerly conveigh'd out of <HI>Euphrates</HI> in a Brick Chanel &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>By the Ruines it appears to have been a great City, from whence the <HI>Arabians</HI> fetch away the Bricks and &s;ell them at <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> The City of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> is half a League from <HI>Euphrates,</HI> which the <HI>Arabians</HI> in their Language call <HI>Shetel-arch,</HI> or the River of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The Inhabitants of the City have made a Chanel to it about half a League long, which bears Ve&s;&s;els of 150 Tuns; at the end where|of &s;tands a Fort, &s;o that no Ve&s;&s;el can get into the Fort without leave. The Sea is above fifteen Leagues upward beyond <HI>Gorno.</HI> The Country is &s;o low, that were it not for a Dam that runs along the Sea-&s;hoar, it would often be in danger of being drown'd. The Dam is above a League in length, and built all of Free-&s;tone &s;o &s;trong, that the fury of the waves can do no injury, though it lie open to a Boy&s;trous Sea.</P>
<P>It is not above a hundred years &s;ince <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> belong'd to the <HI>Arabians</HI> of the De&s;ert, and had no commerce with the Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI> For tho&s;e people were contented to eat their own Dates, having &s;o great a quantity, that they only live upon them. 'Tis the &s;ame thing all along the Gulf on each &s;ide; for from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> to the River <HI>Indus</HI> for above &s;ix hundred Leagues together, and all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;cat&eacute;,</HI> the poor &s;ort of people know not what it is to eat Rice, but live upon Dates and Salt-fi&s;h dry'd in the wind. The Cows eat no Gra&s;s, and though they go abroad in the fields, they find little or nothing among the bu&s;hes which is proper for them to eat. But every Morning before they drive them to the Field&punc; and when they return home, they give them heads of fi&s;h and Date-nuts boil'd together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> having had War with the <HI>Arabians</HI> took <HI>Bal&s;ara;</HI> and yet becau&s;e the <HI>Arabians</HI> always hover'd about the Town, and made booty of all they could lay their hands on, they were forc'd to come to an agreement with them, that the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;hould quietly enjoy all the De&s;ert, 'till within a League of the City; and that the
<PB N="89" REF="59">
<HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould remain peaceable Ma&s;ters of the City, where they have a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> for Governour. But this Treaty endur'd not long; for in the middle of the City there is a Cittadel, call'd <HI>Au&s;hel Ba&s;ha,</HI> or the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s <HI>Court,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> built; &s;o that the Garri&s;on being <HI>Turks</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>Arabians</HI> who could not endure to be curb'd, they oft-times quarrell'd with the <HI>Turks</HI> and came to blows. There|upon the <HI>Arabians</HI> of the De&s;ert came to the relief of the Citizens and be&s;ieg'd the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> in the Fortre&s;s. At length becau&s;e there could be no &s;uch agreement made, but that one party or other took an occa&s;ion pre&s;ently to break it, there was one <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Aiud,</HI> who after many conte&s;ts and revolts which had almo&s;t tyr'd him&punc; re&s;olv'd to rid him&s;elf of the trouble, and &s;old his Government for forty thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> to a rich Lord in the Country, who pre&s;ently rais'd a &s;ufficient number of Souldiers to keep the people in awe. This great man took upon him the name of <HI>Efra&s;ias Ba&s;ha,</HI> being the Grandfather of <HI>Hu&s;&s;en Ba&s;ha,</HI> who was Gover|nour at the time when I pa&s;s'd through before. This <HI>Efra&s;ias</HI> threw off the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> yoak, and took upon him the title of Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> As for the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> that &s;old his Government, he no &s;ooner arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but he was &s;trangl'd. But after <HI>Amurath</HI> had taken <HI>Bagdat,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> was glad to feed him conti|nually with Pre&s;ents that chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in Hor&s;es, which are very beautiful in that Country. The Great <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> having taken <HI>Ormus,</HI> &s;ent a powerful Army under the Command of <HI>Inian-Kouli-Kan</HI> Governour of <HI>Shiras,</HI> to take in <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> Whereupon the Prince finding him&s;elf too weak to re&s;i&s;t &s;o great a Pow'r, made an agreement with the De&s;ert <HI>Arabians</HI> to break down the Dam that &s;tops the Sea. Which being per|form'd, in came the Sea tumbling fifteen Leagues to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and four Leagues be|yond it, which con&s;train'd the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;urrounded with water, and hearing at the &s;ame time of the death of <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> to rai&s;e their Siege. Since that inundation, &s;e|veral Lands and Gardens have been utterly barren, or have born very little, by rea&s;on of the Salt which the Sea has left behind.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> has enter'd into Leagues with &s;everal &s;trange Nations, &s;o that whence&s;oever you come, you may be welcome. There is &s;o much liberty and &s;o good order in the City, that you may walk all night long in the Streets without mo|le&s;tation. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> bring Spices thither every year. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> carry Peper and &s;ome few Cloves; but the <HI>Portugals</HI> have no Trade at all thither. The <HI>Indians</HI> bring Calicuts, Indigo, and all &s;orts of Merchandizes. In &s;hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> there are Mer|chants of all Country's, from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, Cairo,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Turkie,</HI> to buy &s;uch Merchandizes as come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> with which they lade the young Camels which they buy in that place; for thither the <HI>Arabians</HI> bring them to put them to &s;ale. They that come from <HI>Diarbequir, Mou|&s;&s;ul, Bagdat, Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> &s;end their Merchandizes up the <HI>Tigris</HI> by Water, but with great trouble and expence. In regard the Boats are to be tow'd by men, that cannot go above two Leagues and a half in a day, and again&s;t the Wind they cannot &s;tir, which makes them oft-times between <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> and <HI>Bagdat</HI> to be above &s;ixty days, nay there have been &s;ome that have been three months upon the Water.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;toms of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> amount to five in the hundred, but generally you have &s;ome favour &s;hew'd you, either by the Cu&s;tomer or the Prince him&s;elf, that the Merchant does not really pay above four in the hundred. The Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> is &s;o good a Husband, that he lays up three millions of <HI>Livers</HI> in a year. His chiefe&s;t Revenue is in four things, Money, Hor&s;es, Camels, and Date-trees; but in the la&s;t con&s;i&s;ts his chiefe&s;t wealth. For all the Country from the meeting of the two Rivers to the Sea, for the &s;pace of thirty Leagues together, is all cover'd with the&s;e Trees&punc; nor does any one dare to touch a Date, 'till he has paid for every Tree three fourths of a <HI>Larin,</HI> or nine <HI>Sous French.</HI> The profit which the Prince makes upon money, proceeds from this, that the Marchants that come from abroad are oblig'd to carry their <HI>Reals</HI> to his Mint, where they are Coyn'd and converted into <HI>Larins,</HI> which is worth to him eight in the hundred. As for his Hor&s;es&punc; there is no place in the world, where there are more fit for travel, or hand&s;omer &s;hap'd; for there are &s;ome that will travel thirty hours together and never draw bit, e&s;pecially the Mares. But to return to the Palm-Trees it is worth ob&s;ervation, that there is more Art to bring up tho&s;e Trees than any other. The Natives dig a hole in the ground&punc; wherein they heap a great quantity of Date-nuts in a Pyramidical form, the top
<PB N="90" REF="60">
whereof ends in one &s;ingle Nut, which being cover'd with Earth produces the Palm-tree. Mo&s;t of the people of the Country do &s;ay, that in regard there is among the Palm-trees the di&s;tinction of Male and Female, that therefore they mu&s;t be planted one by another, for that otherwi&s;e the Female Tree will bear no Fruit. But others affirm that nicety to be unnece&s;&s;ary; and that it &s;uffices, when the Male is in Blo&s;&s;om to take a Flower from the Male, and put it into the Heart of the Female a little above the Stem; for unle&s;s they &s;hould do &s;o, all the Fruit would fall off before it came to maturity.</P>
<P>There is at <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> a <HI>Cady</HI> that admini&s;ters Ju&s;tice, and who is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the authority of the Prince that commands there. In the City are al&s;o three &s;orts of Chri&s;tians, <HI>Jacobites, Ne&s;torians,</HI> and Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>John.</HI> There is al&s;o a Hou&s;e of <HI>Italian Carmelites;</HI> and there was a Hou&s;e of <HI>Portugal Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars, but they have for&s;ak'n the Town ever &s;ince their Country-men quitted the Trade.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>John</HI> are very numerous at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and the Villages there|abouts; who anciently liv'd by the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> where St. <HI>John</HI> Baptiz'd; and from whom they took their Name. But &s;ince the time that <HI>Mahomet</HI> conquer'd <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> though <HI>Mahomet</HI> &punc;formerly gave them his Hand and his Letters of Pri|viledge that they &s;hould not be mole&s;ted, neverthele&s;s they that &s;ucceeded the fal&s;e Prophet re&s;olv'd to extirpate them all; to which purpo&s;e they ruin'd their Churches, burnt their Books, and exercis'd all manner of cruelties upon their per|&s;ons: which oblig'd them to retire into <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> and <HI>Chaldea,</HI> and for &s;ome time they were under the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> from whom they &s;eparated about a hundred and &s;ixty years ago. Then they remov'd into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the Towns round about <HI>Bal&s;ara;</HI> as <HI>Souter, De&s;poul, Rumez, Bitoum, Mono, Endecan, Calafabat, Aveza, Dega, Dorech, Ma&s;quel, Gumar, Carianous, Bal&s;ara, Onezer, Zech, Loza.</HI> Nor do they inhabit City or Village by which there does not run a River. And many of their Bi&s;hops have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the Chri&s;tians in all the foregoing places make above five and twenty thou&s;and Families. There are &s;ome among them who are Merchants; but the mo&s;t part of them are Trades-men&punc; e&s;pecially Gold|&s;miths, Joyners, and Lock-&s;miths.</P>
<P>Their Creed is full of fables and foul errours. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> call them <HI>Sabbi,</HI> a People that have for&s;ak'n their own Religion, to take up a new one. In their own Language they call them&s;elves <HI>Mendai Jahia,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;ciples of St.</HI> John, from whom, as they a&s;certain us, they have receiv'd their Faith, their Books, and their Traditions. Every year they celebrate a Fea&s;t for about five days, during which time they go in Troops to their Bi&s;hops, who Baptize them according to the Bapti&s;m of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>They never Baptize but in Rivers, and only upon Sundays. But before they go to the River they carry the Infant to Church, where there is a Bi&s;hop who reads certain Prayers over the Head of the Child; from thence they carry the Child to the River, with a Train of Men and Women, who together with the Bi&s;hop go up to the knees in Water. Then the Bi&s;hop reads again certain Prayers out of a Book which he holds in his Hand, which done he &s;prinkles the Infant three times, &s;aying, <HI>Bee&s;mebrad er-Rabi, Kaddemin, Akreri, Menbal el gennet Alli Koulli Kralek;</HI> or, <HI>In the Name of the Lord, fir&s;t and la&s;t of the World and of Paradi&s;e, the high Creator of all things.</HI> After that, the Bi&s;hop reads &s;omething again in his Book, while the God|father plunges the Child all over in the Water; after which they go all to the Parents Hou&s;e to fea&s;t. If any tax their Bapti&s;m for in&s;ufficient, in regard the Three Per&s;ons of the Divinity are not nam'd therein, they can make no rational defence for them|&s;elves. Nor have they any knowledge of the My&s;tery of the Holy Trinity, only they &s;ay that Chri&s;t is the Spirit and Word of the Eternal Father. They are &s;o blind as to believe the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to be the Son of God, begotten upon Light; yet will not believe the Eternal Generation of Chri&s;t, as God. Yet they confe&s;s he became Man, to free us from the Puni&s;hment of Sin: and that he was conceiv'd in the womb of a Virgin without the knowledge of Man, by means of the Water of a certain Fountain which &s;he drank of. They believe he was crucifi'd by the <HI>Jews;</HI> that he ro&s;e the third day; and that his Soul a&s;cending up to Heaven, his Body remain'd on Earth. But like the <HI>Mahometans</HI> they corrupt their Faith, by &s;aying, that Chri&s;t vani&s;h'd when the <HI>Jews</HI> came to take him, and that he deluded their cruelty with his Shadow.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="60">
In the Euchari&s;t they make u&s;e of Meal or Flow'r, kneaded up with Wine and Oyl: For, &s;ay they, the Body of Chri&s;t being compos'd of the two principal parts, Fle&s;h and Blood, the Flow'r and the Wine do mo&s;t perfectly repre&s;ent them; be&s;ides, that Chri&s;t at his Supper made u&s;e of Wine only, and not of Water. They add Oyl, to &s;ignifie the benefit we receive by his favour of the Sacrament, and to put us in mind of our Love and Charity towards God and our Neighbour. To make this Wine, they take Grapes dry'd in the Sun, which they call in their Lan|guage <HI>Zebibes,</HI> and ca&s;ting Water upon them, let them &s;teep for &s;o long a time. The &s;ame Wine they u&s;e for the Con&s;ecration of the Cup. They make u&s;e of Rai&s;ins, in regard they are more ea&s;ie to be had than Wine; the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Arabians,</HI> under who&s;e Government they live, not permitting, nor indeed allowing them the u&s;e of it. Of all people that follow the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> there are none &s;o oppo&s;ite to other Religions, as the&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> about <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> The words of their Con&s;ecration, are no other than certain long Prayers, which they make to prai&s;e and thank God, at the &s;ame time ble&s;&s;ing the Bread and Wine, never making mention of his Body and Blood; which they &s;ay is not at all nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e God knows their intentions. After all the Ceremonies are ended, the Prie&s;t takes the Bread, and having eaten &s;ome of it, di&s;tributes the re&s;t to the People.</P>
<P>As to their Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, when any one dyes, who has a Son, they choo&s;e him in his place; and if he have no Son, they take the next a-kin that is mo&s;t capable and be&s;t in&s;tructed in their Religion. They that make the Election, &s;ay &s;everal Prayers over him that is elected. If he be a Bi&s;hop, after he is receiv'd, and that he go about to Ordain others, he ought to fa&s;t &s;ix days, during which time he continually repeats certain Prayers over him that is to be ordain'd Prie&s;t, who al&s;o for his part fa&s;ts and prays all the &s;aid time. And whereas I &s;ay the Father &s;uccedes the Son, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that among the Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e Parts, both Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts marry, as do the re&s;t of the people; only if their fir&s;t Wife dye, they cannot marry another unle&s;s &s;he be a Virgin. Moreover, they that are admitted to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Function, mu&s;t be of the race of Bi&s;hops or Prie&s;ts; and their Mothers mu&s;t have been always Virgins when they were marry'd. All their Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts wear their Hair long, and a little Cro&s;s wrought with a Needle.</P>
<P>When there is any Wedding to be, the kindred and per&s;ons invited go toge|ther with the Bridegroom, to the Hou&s;e where the Bride lives. Thither comes the Bi&s;hop al&s;o, and approaching the Bride, who is &s;itting under a Canopy, he asks her if &s;he be a Virgin. If &s;he an&s;wer that &s;he is &s;o, he makes her confirm it by an Oath. After which he returns to the Gue&s;ts, and &s;ends his Wife with &s;ome other skilful Women to make an in&s;pection. If they find her to be a Virgin, the Bi&s;hop's Wife returns and makes Oath of it; and then they all go to the River, where the Bi&s;hop re-baptizes the Couple to be marry'd. Then they return toward the Hou&s;e, and making a &s;top before they come quite near it, the Bridgroom takes the Bride by the Hand, and leads her &s;even times from the Company to the Hou&s;e, the Bi&s;hop following them every time, and reading certain Prayers. After that they go into the Hou&s;e, and the Bride and Bridegroom place them&s;elves under the Canopy, where they &s;et their Shoulders one again&s;t another, and the Bi&s;hop reads again, cau&s;ing them to lay their Heads together three times. Then op'ning a Book of Divination, and looking for the mo&s;t fortunate day to con&s;ummate the Marriage, he tells them of it. But if the Bi&s;hop's Wife do not find the Bride to be a Virgin, the Bi&s;hop can proceed no farther, &s;o that if the young Man have &s;till a mind, he mu&s;t go to &s;ome meaner Prie&s;t to perform the Ceremony. Which is the rea&s;on that the people take it for a great di&s;honour to be marry'd by any other than the Bi&s;hops; for when a Prie&s;t marries, 'tis an infallible &s;ign that the Bride was no Virgin. The Prie&s;ts al&s;o, in regard they take it to be a great Sin for a Woman to marry not being a Virgin, they never marry any &s;uch but by con&s;traint, and to avoid en&s;uing inconveniencies; for &s;ometimes in de&s;pite they will turn <HI>Mahometans.</HI> The rea&s;on of the In&s;pection is, that the Husbands may not be deceiv'd, and to keep the young Girls in awe.</P>
<P>As to what they believe touching the <HI>Creation of the World,</HI> they &s;ay, that the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> undertaking to create the World according to the command which
<PB N="92" REF="61">
God gave him, took along with him three hundred thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and Demons, and made the earth &s;o fertile, that it was but to Sow in the Morning and Reap at Night. That the &s;ame Angel taught <HI>Adam</HI> to Plant and Sow, and all other nece&s;&s;ary Sciences. Moreover that the &s;ame Angel made the &s;even lower Spheres, the lea&s;t whereof reaches to the Center of the World, in the &s;ame manner as the Heavens do, all contriv'd one within another. That all the&s;e Spheres are of different Metals, the fir&s;t next the Center is of Iron, the &s;econd of Lead, the third of Bra&s;s, the fourth of Laten, the fifth of Silver, the &s;ixth of Gold, and the &s;eventh of Earth. The &s;eventh is that which contains all the re&s;t, and is the chiefe&s;t of all, as being the mo&s;t fruitful and profitable to Man, and the mo&s;t proper to pre&s;erve Man|kind, whereas the re&s;t &s;eem rather to be fram'd for its de&s;truction. They believe that over every Heaven there is Water, whence they conclude that the Sun &s;wims in a Ship upon that Water, and that the Ma&s;t of his Ship is a Cro&s;s, and that there are a great number of Boys and Servants to guide the Ships of the Sun and Moon. Be&s;ides, they have the Picture of a Barque, which they &s;ay belong'd to the Angel <HI>Bacan,</HI> whom God &s;ends to vi&s;it the Sun and Moon, to &s;ee whether they move right or no, and keep clo&s;e to their duty.</P>
<P>In reference to the other World and Life to come, they believe there is no other World, but where Angels and Devils, the Souls of good and bad re&s;ide. That in that World there are Cities, Hou&s;es, and Churches, and that the Evil Spirits have al&s;o Churches, where they pray, &s;inging and rejoycing upon In&s;truments, and Fea&s;ting as in this World. That when any one lies at the point of death, three hundred and &s;ixty Demons come and carry his-Soul to a place full of Serpents, Dogs, Lyons, Tygres, and Devils; who, if it be the Soul of a wicked man, tear it in pieces; but being the Soul of a Ju&s;t man, it creeps under the bellies of tho&s;e Crea|tures into the pre&s;ence of God, who &s;its in his &s;eat of Maje&s;ty to judge the World. That there are Angels al&s;o that weigh the Souls of Men in a Ballance, who being thought worthy, are admitted immediately into Glory. That the Angels and Devils are Male and Female, and beget Children. That the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> is the Son of God engender'd upon Light, and that he has a Daughter call'd <HI>Souret</HI> who has two Sons. That the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> has &s;everal Legions of Demons under him who are in&s;tead of Souldiers, and others that are his Officers of Ju&s;tice, whom he &s;ends from Town to Town, and from City to City, to puni&s;h the wicked.</P>
<P>In reference to Saints, they hold that Chri&s;t left twelve Apo&s;tles to Preach to the Nations. That the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is not dead, but that &s;he lives &s;omewhere in the World, though there be no per&s;on that can tell where &s;he is. That next to her St. <HI>John</HI> is the chiefe&s;t Saint in Heaven, and next to them <HI>Zacharias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of whom they recompt &s;everal Miracles and Apocryphal Tales. For they believe that they two begat St. <HI>John</HI> only by embracing; that when he came to be of age they Marry'd him, and that he had four Sons which he begat upon the waters of <HI>Jordan.</HI> That when St. <HI>John</HI> de&s;ir'd a Son, he pray'd to God, who drew him one out of the water; &s;o that St. <HI>John</HI> had no more to do with his Wife but only to give her the Child to bring up. That he dy'd a natural death, but that he commanded his Di&s;ciples to Crucifie him after his death, that he might be like Chri&s;t. La&s;tly, that he dy'd in the City of <HI>Fu&s;ter,</HI> and that he was buri'd in a Chry&s;tal Tomb, brought by miracle to the City, and that this Sepulchre was in a certain Hou&s;e near the River <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>They highly honour the Cro&s;s, and &s;ign them&s;elves with it; but they are very careful of letting the <HI>Turks</HI> ob&s;erve them; and during their Ceremonies, they &s;et a Watch at their Church doors for fear the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould enter, and lay &s;ome unju&s;t Fine upon them. When they have ador'd the Cro&s;s, they take it in two pieces, which they never put together again, 'till their Service re-begins. The rea&s;on why they &s;o adore the Cro&s;s is drawn out of a Book which they have, Entitul'd <HI>The Di|van.</HI> Where it is written that every day early in the Morning, the Angels take the Cro&s;s and put it in the middle of the Sun, which receives his light from it, as the Moon al&s;o doth hers. They add, that in the &s;ame Book are Pictur'd two Ships, one of which is nam'd the Sun, the other the Moon; and that in every one of the&s;e Ships there is a Cro&s;s full of Bells: And moreover, that if there were not a Cro&s;s in tho&s;e two Ships, the Sun and Moon would be depriv'd of Light, and the Ships would &s;uffer Shipwrack.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="61">
Their chief Fe&s;tivals are three. The one in Winter, that la&s;ts three days, in memory of our fir&s;t Parent and the Creation of the World. The other in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that al&s;o la&s;ts three days, which is call'd the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>John.</HI> The third which la&s;ts five days, in <HI>June,</HI> during which time they are all re-baptiz'd. They ob&s;erve <HI>Sunday,</HI> doing no work upon that day. They neither Fa&s;t nor do any penance. They have no Canonical Books, but a great number of others that treat of nothing but Witchcraft, in which they believe their Prie&s;ts to be very crafty, and that the Devils are at their beck. They hold all Women to be unclean, and that it is not at all available for them to come to the Church.</P>
<P>They have one Ceremony, which they call the Ceremony <HI>of the Hen,</HI> of which they make great Accompt, which is not lawful for any to perform but a Prie&s;t Born of a Virgin at the time of her Marriage. When a hen is to be kill'd the Prie&s;t puts off his ordinary habit, and puts on a Linnen Cloth, girding his wa&s;te with a &s;econd, and throwing a third about his &s;houlders like a Stole. Then he takes the Fowl, and plunges it in the water to make it clean; after which he turns toward the Ea&s;t and cuts off the head, holding the Body in his hand 'till it has bled out all the blood. While the Hen bleeds, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he were in an exta&s;ie, he repeats in his own Language the&s;e words following: <HI>In the name of God, may this fle&s;h be profitable to all that cat of it?</HI> They ob&s;erve the &s;ame ceremony when they kill Sheep. For fir&s;t, they clean&s;e the place very carefully where the Sheep is to be kill'd, wa&s;hing it with water, and &s;trewing it with boughs, nor is the number of people &s;mall that a&s;&s;i&s;ts at this Ceremony, as if it were at &s;ome &s;olemn Sacrifice. If you ask them why it is not lawful for the Laity to kill Fowls? They an&s;wer that it is no more lawful for them to kill than to con&s;ecrate them; and that is all the rea&s;on which they bring. They eat of nothing dre&s;t by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and if a <HI>Turk</HI> ask them for drink, &s;o &s;oon as he has drank, they break the Cup. And to make the <HI>Turks</HI> more hateful, they Picture <HI>Mahomet</HI> like a great Gyant, &s;hut up in Pri&s;on in Hell with four more of his Parents; and they &s;ay, that all the <HI>Turks</HI> are carry'd into the &s;ame place full of wild Bea&s;ts to be there devour'd.</P>
<P><HI>They pretend all to Salvation. For, &s;ay they, after the Angel</HI> Gabriel <HI>had fram'd the World by the command of God, he thus di&s;cours'd him.</HI> Lord God, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> behold I have built the World as thou did&s;t command me. It has put me to a great deal of trouble, and my Brethren al&s;o, to rai&s;e &s;uch high Mountains that &s;eem to &s;u&s;tain Heaven. And who indeed was able to make way for Rivers through Mountains without va&s;t, labour, and to give every thing its proper place? Moreover, great God, by the aid of thy powerful Arm, we have brought the World to &s;o much perfection, that men cannot think upon any thing needful for them, which is not to be found therein. But in&s;tead of that &s;atis|faction which I ought to have for having accompli&s;h'd &s;o great a work, I find no rea&s;on but to be altogether griev'd. <HI>When God demanding the cau&s;e, the Angel</HI> Gabriel <HI>an&s;wer'd:</HI> My God and Father, I will tell you what afflicts me; becau&s;e that after the making of the World as I have done, I fore&s;ee that there will come into it a prodigious number of <HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> Idolaters, and other Infidels, Enemies of your Name, who will be un|worthy to eat and enjoy the Fruits of our Labours. <HI>To whom God thus reply'd:</HI> Never grieve, my Son, there &s;hall live in this World which thou ha&s;t built, certain Chri&s;tians of St. <HI>John</HI> who &s;hall be my friends, and &s;hall be all &s;av'd. <HI>Upon which the Angel admiring how that &s;hould be!</HI> What, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> will there not be &s;everal Sinners among tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, and by con&s;equence will not they be your Enemies? <HI>To whom God thus concluded:</HI> That at the day of Judgment the Good &s;hould Pray for the Wicked, and by that means they &s;hould be all forgiv'n, and obtain Salvation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Chri&s;tians have a &s;trange Antipathy again&s;t the Blew Colour call'd Indigo, which they will not &s;o much as touch. For certain <HI>Jews</HI> dreaming that their Law &s;hould be aboli&s;h'd by St. <HI>John,</HI> told it their Country-men. Which they under|&s;tanding, and &s;eeing that St. <HI>John</HI> prepar'd to Baptize Chri&s;t, in a great rage, fetch'd a va&s;t quantity of Indigo, which they call <HI>Nill</HI> in their Language, and flung it into <HI>Jordan.</HI> They add al&s;o that tho&s;e Waters continu'd unclean for &s;ome time, and had hinder'd the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, had not God &s;ent his Angels with a large Ve&s;&s;el of water, which he caus'd them to fill out of <HI>Jordan</HI> before the <HI>Jews</HI> had defil'd it with Indigo; for which rea&s;on God particularly Curs'd that Colour.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the Road from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> to <HI>Ormus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe tenth of <HI>April</HI> we &s;et out from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> for <HI>Bandar-Congo,</HI> for which pa&s;&s;age we hir'd a <HI>Terrade</HI> or a Barque for the purpo&s;e; for they which are laden with Dates are generally &s;o overcharg'd&punc; that if a Storm ri&s;es, they are in danger of being over&s;et. The River of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> is very dan|gerous, by rea&s;on of the Sands which al&s;o lie up and down the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, and are very prejudicial to Navigation in that place. On both &s;ides the Gulf that &s;epa|rates <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Arabia the Happy,</HI> live a &s;ort of poor people that follow no other Trade than fi&s;hing; &s;o poor, that when they bring fi&s;h to your Ve&s;&s;el, they require nothing for it but Rice; and not the be&s;t neither, but &s;uch coar&s;e &s;tuff as we feed our Hens and Pigs withal. I gave them a Sack of thirty or fourty pounds, and bid them make merry with it, but they told me, they mu&s;t be careful how they &s;pent &s;uch Rice as that, unle&s;s it were for their Sick, or at their Weddings; &s;o that if the re&s;t of <HI>Arabia the Happy</HI> be like that, a&s;&s;uredly 'tis rather a mo&s;t unfortunate Country.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal I&s;les in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, but the chiefe&s;t of all is the I&s;le of <HI>Baharen,</HI> where they fi&s;h for Pearls, of which I have &s;poken in its proper place.</P>
<P>Near to the place where <HI>Euphrates</HI> falls from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> into the Sea, there is a little I&s;land, where the Barques generally come to an Anchor, in expectation of the wind. There we &s;tay'd four days, whence to <HI>Bandar-Congo,</HI> it is fourteen days Sail, and we got thither the twenty-third of <HI>April.</HI> This place would be a far better habitation for the Merchants than <HI>Ormus,</HI> where it is very unwhole&s;om and dangerous to live. But that which hinders the Trade from <HI>Bandar-Congo</HI> is, becau&s;e the Road to <HI>Lar</HI> is &s;o bad, by rea&s;on of the want of Water, and craggy narrow ways, which only Camels can endure; but from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>Lar</HI> the way is tolerable. We &s;tay'd at <HI>Bandar-Congo</HI> two days, where there is a <HI>Portugais</HI> Factor, who receives one half of the Cu&s;toms by agreement&punc; with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> By the way take notice, that they who will go by Water from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> mu&s;t take the Natives for their Pilots, and be continually &s;ounding be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The thirtieth, we hir'd a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> and after three or four hours Sailing, we put into a Village upon the Sea-&s;ide, in the I&s;land of <HI>Keck|mi&s;he.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Keckmi&s;he</HI> is an I&s;land three Leagues about, and about five or &s;ix from <HI>Ormus.</HI> It excedes in Fertility all the I&s;lands of the Ea&s;t, that produce neither Wheat nor Bar|ley; but at <HI>Keckmi&s;he</HI> is a Magazine of both, without which <HI>Ormus</HI> would hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in regard it furni&s;hes that City with mo&s;t of their Provi&s;ion for their Hor&s;es. There is in the I&s;land a Spring of good Water, for the pre&s;ervation of which, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have built a Fort, le&s;t the <HI>Portugals</HI> when they held <HI>Ormus,</HI> &s;hould get it into their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1641. and 1642. the <HI>Hollanders</HI> falling out with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> about their Silk Trade, be&s;ieg'd this I&s;land. For the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> com|ing into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> were jealous that they came to fetch away all the Silk; and thereupon enhanc'd the Market from forty-two to fifty <HI>Tomans.</HI> When the Amba&s;&s;adors were gone, the <HI>Dutch</HI> would pay no more than forty-four, which was two <HI>Tomans</HI> more than they were us'd to do. The King netl'd that they would not &s;tand to their words, forbid that they &s;hould make &s;ale of their Goods 'till they had paid their Cu&s;toms, from which 'till that time they were exempted. Thereupon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> be&s;ieg'd the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Keckmi&s;he,</HI> but the Heats were &s;o intolera|ble, that they were forc'd to quit their de&s;ign with great lo&s;s of their Men; and at length by great Pre&s;ents to the chief Courtiers, they obtain'd to pay no more than forty-&s;ix <HI>Tomans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Larec</HI> is an I&s;land nearer to <HI>Ormus</HI> than <HI>Keckmi&s;he,</HI> well inhabited, and &s;o &s;tor'd with Stags and Hinds, that in one day we kill'd five and forty.</P>
<P>From <HI>Keckmi&s;he</HI> we Sail'd for <HI>Ormus,</HI> where we arriv'd the fir&s;t of <HI>May.</HI> I had
<PB N="95" REF="62">
put my choice&s;t Goods in a Che&s;t directed for the <HI>Holland</HI> Commander at <HI>Ormus,</HI> by which means I got the Cu&s;tom free.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf is the mo&s;t dangerous Gulf I know, by rea&s;on of the &s;hallow|ne&s;s and &s;harp Promontories that point out into the Sea; and therefore the be&s;t way is to take a Pilot at <HI>Ormus</HI> or <HI>Bander-Congo,</HI> and the mo&s;t proper Pilots are the Fi&s;her|men, who are only skill'd in that Sea and no farther. The Soyl about the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf is dry Sand and without Water, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to Travel by Land from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> The Merchants would be glad to find a way through the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia</HI> to get to <HI>Ma&s;cat&eacute;&punc;</HI> whence there might a cut be made to <HI>Sindi, Diu,</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> which are the three chief Ports of <HI>India.</HI> During the difference between the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the <HI>Emir</HI> of <HI>Vodana</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, offer'd to &s;hew them an ea&s;ie Road from <HI>Ma&s;cat&eacute;</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fearing to break with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they vended above fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred thou&s;and pounds of their Pepper, and paid therewith for all their Silk, did not think it worth their while t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> quit <HI>Ormus</HI> to &s;ettle them&s;elves at <HI>Ma&s;|cat&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>Had it been yielded to, the way had been from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> to <HI>Elcatif</HI> a Sea-Town in <HI>Arabia the Happy,</HI> where there is a Fi&s;hery for Pearls that belongs to the <HI>Emir</HI> of <HI>Elcatif.</HI> From <HI>Elcatif</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;calat,</HI> another City of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the re&s;idence of another <HI>Emir.</HI> From <HI>Ma&s;calat</HI> to <HI>Vodana,</HI> a good hand&s;om City &s;eated upon the meeting of two little Rivers that carry Barques to the Sea, and run together by the &s;ingle name of <HI>Moy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ur.</HI> The Soyl about <HI>Vodana</HI> produces no Corn, and very little Rice; but it abounds in Fruits, e&s;pecially Prunes and Quinces, which are not &s;o &s;our as ours, and are eaten by the Natives as Pears. There are extraordinary good Melons and great Store of Grapes, of which the <HI>Jews,</HI> who inhabit the be&s;t part of the City, are permitted to make Wine. From <HI>Vodana</HI> to the Gulf, the Country of each &s;ide is full of Palm-Trees, the Dates being the Food of the common people, who have not Money to buy either Corn or Rice. From <HI>Vodana</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;cat&eacute;</HI> it is but fifteen Leagues, though by the Maps, which are Erroneous, the way is de&s;crib'd to be much longer.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Ormus,</HI> the <HI>Emir</HI> of <HI>Vodana</HI> &s;hew'd me a Pearl tran&s;parent and perfectly round, that weigh'd &s;eventeen <HI>Abas,</HI> or fourteen <HI>Carats</HI> and &s;even <HI>Eights;</HI> for in all the Pearl Fi&s;heries of the Ea&s;t they u&s;e no other weights but <HI>Abas,</HI> which make &s;even Eights of a <HI>Carat.</HI> I offer'd him 300000 <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> or 60000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for the &s;ame Pearl, but the <HI>Emir</HI> refus'd to take it, telling me that he had been offer'd more Money for it by &s;everal Princes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who had &s;ent to him to buy it, but that he was re&s;olv'd never to part with it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Authors fir&s;t Voyage, and the adventure of four <HI>French|men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Departed out of <HI>Paris</HI> in the year 1657, and Embark'd at <HI>Mar&s;cilles</HI> for <HI>Ligorn.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;et Sail from <HI>Ligorn</HI> &s;even Ve&s;&s;els together, two bound for <HI>Venice,</HI> one for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> one for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and three for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in one of which be|ing a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el I Embark'd. But before I leave <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to begin my Journey from <HI>Tauris,</HI> give me leave to relate the &s;tory of four <HI>French-men,</HI> the various acci|dents whereof will much enlight'n the Reader into the Cu&s;toms and Manners, as well of the <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>While I &s;tay'd the departure of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> which could not be ready in five or &s;ix Weeks, as al&s;o upon the advice of a rich <HI>Jew</HI> and a Merchant of Jewels at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> who had &s;everal Pearls to &s;ell, as well for their beauty as their bigne&s;s, the be&s;t Commodity a man can carry to the <HI>Indies,</HI> I &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> a per&s;on that I
<PB N="96" REF="63">
carry'd along with me, one that was well vers'd in that &s;ort of Commodity. There was a <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman nam'd <HI>de Reville</HI> then at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who would needs accom|pany my Factor, &s;o that they went both together in a Ve&s;&s;el that carry'd the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador and his Lady to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> This Gentleman had two or three thou|&s;and <HI>Ducats</HI> in his Pur&s;e, wanting neither wit nor courage, be&s;ides a good pre&s;ence; but perhaps he was more ha&s;ty in his proceedings than the re&s;erv'dne&s;s of that Coun|try requir'd. He had left the Service of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> thinking to find an employ|ment in the Service of the <HI>Venetians</HI> at <HI>Candy&punc;</HI> but failing in his expectations, he re|&s;olv'd to travel into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> While he was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> who lay hold upon all opportunities of gain, &s;oon found out my Factor; and be&s;ides the Pearls which he de&s;ired to &s;ee, they &s;hew'd him &s;everal other rich Stones to try whether they could draw him in; for he had refus'd the Pearls becau&s;e they held them at too high a Rate. The <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman fell into their acquaintance; and picking out the riche&s;t, told him, that being re&s;olv'd for the <HI>Indies,</HI> he had a mind to lay out four thou&s;and <HI>Ducats</HI> in Pearls, He added al&s;o, that he would pay him half in Money, half in Goods, and at the &s;ame time &s;hew'd the <HI>Jew</HI> two thou&s;and <HI>Ducats,</HI> which the <HI>Jew</HI> had already devour'd with his eyes. Some four days after, the <HI>Jew</HI> brought the Gentleman four fair Pearles with &s;ome Emraulds; and you may be &s;ure they ea&s;ily agreed upon the price, in regard the Gentleman had a de&s;ign to put a trick upon the <HI>Jew.</HI> Thereupon he &s;hews his <HI>Ducats</HI> a &s;econd time, which the <HI>Jew,</HI> who thought he had a Cully, pre&s;ently told out as his own. After that the <HI>Jew</HI> de&s;iring to &s;ee the Goods, which made up the other part of the payment, the Gen|tleman without any more ado told him, that all the Merchandize which he had to pay him, was a good &s;trong Quartan Ague which had held him a long time, and indeed &s;uch a one, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly meet with a better, but that he would not over-rate it, in regard he ask'd but two thou&s;and <HI>Ducats</HI> for it. The <HI>Jew</HI> who was rich and in great credit at Court, was &s;o incens'd at his raillery, that he had like to have made a wicked &s;tir about it. For as he had heard him &s;ay, that the Gentleman was going into the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he might have ea&s;ily caus'd him to have been apprehended for a Spy. But in regard the <HI>Jews</HI> can do nothing in point of Trade without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>French</HI> Merchants, he adviz'd with &s;ome of them, who per&s;waded him that it was an Act of folly, which it better became him to excu&s;e, and de&s;ir'd him to take his Goods again, and put up the bu&s;ine&s;s; which with much ado they per&s;waded him to conde&s;cend to&punc; The Gentleman fear|ing le&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> underhand &s;hould do him a private mi&s;chief, &s;tole away with what &s;peed he could, and return'd to <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De Reville</HI> being thus return'd to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> put him&s;elf into an <HI>Almadier,</HI> which is a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of War, that generally touches at <HI>Chio</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> being bound for <HI>Cyprus,</HI> from whence there is always &s;ome convenience or other to get to <HI>Alexan|dretta.</HI> From thence he went to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and while he &s;tay'd there he met with two <HI>French</HI>-men, the one who&s;e name was <HI>Neret,</HI> the other <HI>Hautin,</HI> who was an Ac|comptant. They had four Wooden Che&s;ts full of fal&s;e Stones ready &s;et, by which they flatter'd them&s;elves to be great gainers in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> They went from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> to <HI>Seyde,</HI> from <HI>Seyde</HI> to <HI>Damas,</HI> hearing that there was an opportunity to Travel to <HI>Bagdat</HI> with the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi.</HI> This <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> or chief of the Engineers, was he that a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Amurath</HI> in the taking of <HI>Bagdat;</HI> in recompence whereof the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> gave him a <HI>Timar,</HI> or Lord&s;hip in <HI>Damas</HI> worth four thou&s;and Crowns a year. Now it was his cu&s;tom every year to vi&s;it <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and to &s;tay there during the Sea&s;on, that there was any probability of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s be&s;ieging it; which Sea&s;on not la&s;ting above three or four Months, when that was over, he return'd to <HI>Damas.</HI> He u&s;ually had about thirty Hor&s;e with him, with which he never made it above eighteen or twenty days, taking the &s;horte&s;t cut directly through the De|&s;ert, where the <HI>Arabs</HI> are commanded to bring him Victuals upon the Road. And he is willing at any time when he has this opportunity, to conduct the <HI>Franks</HI> that de&s;ire it that way, in regard they are never ungrateful to him for it. The&s;e two <HI>Franks</HI> therefore having de&s;ir'd that they might be taken into his Company, the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi&punc;</HI> readily con&s;ented; provided they could &s;tay 'till he went, which would not be 'till two or three Months; with which an&s;wer they were well &s;atisfi'd&punc; But the two <HI>Franks</HI> had not &s;tay'd at <HI>Damas</HI> above &s;even or eight days but they fell acquainted with a <HI>Spahi,</HI> a <HI>Kenegado</HI> of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> who proffer'd to carry them
<PB N="97" REF="63">
through the Road of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> &s;o that they &s;hould be at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> before the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi,</HI> &s;et out from <HI>Damas.</HI> Thereupon they privately departed out of <HI>Damas</HI> without acquainting the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who under&s;tanding they were gone after the courte&s;ie he had offer'd them, was &s;o enrag'd at their uncivility, that he &s;ent two of his <HI>Arabian</HI> Servants directly through the Wilderne&s;s to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> to give him advice of two <HI>Franks</HI> that were to pa&s;s that way, who were mo&s;t certainly Spies, de&s;cribing them withal from head to foot.</P>
<P>In the mean while the two <HI>Franks</HI> being arriv'd at <HI>Ourfa,</HI> the <HI>Spahi,</HI> as he had contriv'd his own de&s;ign at <HI>Damas,</HI> goes to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Ourfa,</HI> and informs him that he had con|ducted thither two <HI>Franks,</HI> who could be no other than Spies. Thereupon the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;eiz'd upon them and all their Goods, among the re&s;t he laid his paws upon &s;even hundred Pia&s;ters, of which the <HI>Spahi</HI> no doubt had his &s;hare. And this may &s;erve for in&s;truction to Travellers to have a care how and with whom they Travel in <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>While the two <HI>French</HI>-men were in hold at <HI>Ourfa</HI> by one &s;ort of Treachery, the <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman and his Companion arriv'd at <HI>Bagdat.</HI> But they had no &s;ooner &s;et their feet upon the &s;hore, when the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> verily believing them, to be the per&s;ons, of whom the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> had giv'n him notice, caus'd them to be brought before him, and &s;eiz'd upon their Goods and Letters, of which they had &s;everal for the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and other rich Merchants for <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;ent for the <HI>Capuchins</HI> to read tho&s;e Letters, but not believing them, he &s;ent for a <HI>Sicilian</HI> Phy&s;ician which he had in his Service, and his Trea&s;urer who had been a Slave tak'n in <HI>Candy.</HI> But neither Phy&s;ician, Trea&s;urer, nor <HI>Capuchins</HI> would in|terpret any thing in prejudice of the <HI>French</HI>-men; yet all that could not pre&s;erve them from being &s;hut up in a Stable full of dung, and from being threaten'd to be Shot out of a Cannon's mouth if they would not confe&s;s the truth. Thereupon the <HI>Capuchins</HI> and the <HI>Cadi</HI> beg'd him to &s;u&s;pend his Sentence 'till the Arrival of the chief of the Cannoniers, to which he readily con&s;ented.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> came, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> commanded the Pri&s;oners to be brought before him. But when the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> deny'd them to be the per&s;ons, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> grew into &s;uch a rage, that he no le&s;s reproach'd the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> for Treachery, than he had accus'd the others. Which &s;o incens'd the <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> on the other &s;ide, that he never left till he had obtain'd the relea&s;e of the two <HI>French</HI>-men; yet not &s;o, but that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> would have his due; &s;o that <HI>Reville</HI> was forc'd to leave &s;ome of his <HI>Ducats</HI> behind which the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;hould have had.</P>
<P>But now to return to <HI>Smyrna</HI> where I expected the <HI>Caravan</HI> for &s;ome time in order to my Journey into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Every thing being provided, we &s;et forward in the Road for <HI>Tauris,</HI> which I have at large de&s;crib'd, nor was there any thing worthy ob&s;ervation all the way. I Will only take notice, that when we departed from <HI>Tocat,</HI> in re|gard the heat was &s;o extream, we left the common Road toward the North, and took the way through the Mountains, where there is always a fre&s;h Breeze and &s;tore of &s;hady Lanes. In many of which high Mountains we met with Snow, and abun|dance of excellent Sorrel; and upon the tops of &s;ome of tho&s;e Mountains, we met with &s;everal &s;orts of &s;hells, as it had been upon the Sea &s;hore, which is very extraordinary. From <HI>Erzerom</HI> we went to <HI>Cars;</HI> from <HI>Cars</HI> we came to <HI>Erivan.</HI> The <HI>Kan</HI> was not there then, being retir'd during the heat into the Mountains, a days Journey from the City. His Lieutenant telling me that I could not well pa&s;s farther without paying my duty to the <HI>Kan;</HI> I follow'd his advice, and found him in his Tent in a fair dale, where there was a great quantity of Snow: and where when it began to melt, appear'd &s;everal beautiful Flowers, &s;o that Summer and Winter &s;eem'd to lodge both in the &s;ame place. The <HI>Kan</HI> entertain'd both me and all my Company mo&s;t nobly for ten days. I drove al&s;o a &s;mall Trade with him.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Authors &s;ixth and la&s;t Voyage from his &s;etting out of <HI>Paris,</HI> to his Landing at <HI>Smyrna.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Set out of <HI>Paris</HI> in the year 1663. for <HI>Lyons,</HI> with &s;ix &s;everal Servants of &s;everal profe&s;&s;ions, which I thought mo&s;t proper for my bu&s;ine&s;s. I carry'd with me the value of about four hundred thou&s;and <HI>Livers,</HI> part in Jewels, part in <HI>Gold&s;miths</HI> work and other curio&s;ities, which&punc; I de&s;ign'd for the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> Being at <HI>Lyons</HI> I bought a Steel Mirrour round and hollow, about two foot and a half in Diameter, would immediately melt a Half-Crown by the heat of the Sun-beams: and if you &s;et a Candle by it in the night, you might read two hundred Paces off in your Bed by the reflection.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lyons</HI> I rode to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and &s;et Sail for <HI>Ligorn</HI> the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> 1664. in a &s;mall Bark, but being &s;car'd by a great Ve&s;&s;el that we &s;aw off at Sea, we came to an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Aga&iuml;e,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Frejus,</HI> where there &s;tood a pittiful Fort with two or three Hou&s;es. There we al&s;o went a&s;hore and &s;aw a Garden, the Alleys of which were di&s;tingui&s;h'd with rows of Citron and Orange Trees, which look'd as Green in the depth of Winter as in the mid&s;t of Summer, with &s;everal other curio&s;ities after the mode of <HI>Italy.</HI> We were no &s;ooner got aboard again, but we perceiv'd another Ve&s;&s;el making into the &s;ame Port with full Sail. It was a Ve&s;&s;el which the Ma&s;ters of the Forein Office at <HI>Toulon,</HI> had &s;et out
<PB N="100" REF="65">
to force all Ships that were bound into <HI>Italy</HI> to pay certain Cu&s;toms, which tho&s;e of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> would not pay when they came into the Port of <HI>Toulon.</HI> Thereupon fore&s;eeing that there would be mi&s;chief done. I called for my little Che&s;ts that con|tain'd my Goods of greate&s;t value, carrying &s;ome part my &s;elf, and giving the re&s;t to one of my mo&s;t tru&s;ty Servants, thinking to have skipt into a <HI>Genoa</HI> Bark that lay hard by us; but in&s;tead of leaping a-board, I fell into the Sea: where by rea&s;on of the Tumult I had peri&s;h'd without relief, had I not by good fortune laid hold of a Cable and redeem'd my &s;elf. At what time one of my Servants, luckily coming to my aid, with much ado drew me up &s;afe again.</P>
<P>Having e&s;cap'd this danger, I got a-&s;hoar with &s;uch of my Servants as I had about me, and meeting with a Bark of <HI>Frontignan</HI> that carry'd <HI>Languedock</HI>-Wine to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> I hir'd him for <HI>Ligorn;</HI> and &s;etting Sail, we fir&s;t touch'd <HI>Villa|franca,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Monaco.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Monaco</HI> I went a-&s;hoar, and went to wait upon Madam the Prince&s;s, who &s;hew'd me the Rarities in the Ca&s;tle; among the re&s;t, &s;everal pieces of extraordinary Painting, &s;everal pieces of Clock-work and Gold&s;miths-work. But among all her Curio&s;ities &s;he &s;hew'd me two pieces of Cry&s;tal, about the bigne&s;s of two Fi&s;ts each, in one of which there was above a Gla&s;s full of Water, in the other a good quan|tity of Mo&s;s; which were clos'd in by Nature when the Cry&s;tal fir&s;t con|geal'd.</P>
<P><HI>Monaco</HI> is a Ca&s;tle &s;ituated upon a &s;teep Rock, advancing out into the Sea; which advantage, together with others which it receives from Art and Nature, renders it one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Forts in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The next day finding the <HI>Frontignan</HI>-Ve&s;&s;el to be deep-laden, and that it made little way, I took a Faluke, and kept along by the Shoar, which was mo&s;t plea&s;antly adorn'd with beautiful Villages and Hou&s;es, as far as <HI>Savona;</HI> where I chang'd my Faluke, to compleat the re&s;t of the way which I had to <HI>Genoa.</HI> Half the way we did very well, but the Wind ri&s;ing, we were forc'd to put into a great Town, where we landed; and from thence, having but nine Miles, I got in good time by Hor&s;e to <HI>Genoa.</HI> There can be no Pro&s;pect certainly more plea&s;ing than that nine Miles riding. For on the one &s;ide you &s;ee nothing but a continu'd Row of magni|ficent Buldings and lovely Gardens; on the other a calm Shoar, upon which the Waves &s;eem not to beat, but lovingly to ki&s;s.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Genoa,</HI> I met with the re&s;t of my Servants; and at the end of two days I embarqu'd for <HI>Ligorn,</HI> where we arriv'd in four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ligorn</HI> I went to the Court of <HI>Florence,</HI> to wait upon the Grand Duke. By whom I had the honour to be admitted into his Chamber, where I found no body attending but one Mute, who had a long time &s;erv'd his Highne&s;s: and I ob&s;erv'd that they under&s;tood one another by Signs, as perfectly as if the Mute had had his Speech and Hearing. So that when ever the Duke &s;ent him into his Clo&s;et for any Papers or other thing what&s;oever, he never fail'd to bring the right.</P>
<P>After I had tak'n my leave of the Duke, he &s;ent me a noble Pre&s;ent of Wine and Fruits; but that which I valu'd more than all the re&s;t, was a Ca&s;e of Medicaments and Counter-poy&s;ons, in the compo&s;ition whereof the <HI>Italians</HI> are very exqui&s;ite. And yet they did me no &s;ervice; for when I came into the hot Countries their fermentation was &s;o &s;trong, that all the Oyls and Treacles broke their &s;everal Boxes, that I could &s;ave nothing of that precious Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next day, being the twenty-&s;ixth of <HI>March</HI> 1664, I embarqu'd with all my Servants in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el call'd <HI>The Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh we &s;taid in the Road, expecting the re&s;t of the Fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting of eleven Ships, two Men of War, and nine Merchant-men; four of which were bound for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> there for <HI>Ancona,</HI> and two for <HI>Venice.</HI> About &s;even that evening we &s;et Sail, and all that night the Wind was favourable, but blew hard and veer'd often; which was the rea&s;on that two of our Fleet &s;eparated from us, &s;teering between the I&s;le of <HI>Elbe</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> while we kept on between the I&s;le of <HI>Elba</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-eighth by eight in the Morning we found our &s;elves between <HI>Porto Ferraro</HI> and <HI>Piombino,</HI> and it being fair Weather, we had a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of tho&s;e two places. From thence we &s;teer'd between two Ilands, the one call'd <HI>Pal|majola,</HI> the other being namele&s;s. About &s;ix hours after we &s;aw <HI>Portolongone,</HI> afterwards at a di&s;tance we de&s;cry'd <HI>Monte-Chri&s;to.</HI> An hour after Noon we di&s;|cover'd

<P>The twenty-ninth, with the &s;ame Wind at North-We&s;t, by Morning we di&s;co|ver'd the Ilands of <HI>Pontia</HI> and <HI>Parmerola,</HI> and about Evening tho&s;e of <HI>Ventitione</HI> and <HI>I&s;chia.</HI> Night approaching, and there being no news of the Ships we had lo&s;t, in&s;tead of making the <HI>Pharo</HI> of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> it was re&s;olv'd that we &s;hould &s;teer a Cour&s;e round about <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> where we expected to overtake them. At eleven a Clock in the Evening we had but little Wind at North-North-We&s;t, &s;o that we made not above fourteen Leagues of way.</P>
<P>The thirty-fir&s;t the &s;ame Wind continu'd, with a high Sea; but about nine at Night the Wind chopping about to the We&s;t, we kept our former Cour&s;e.</P>

<P>The &s;econd and third the Weather was ill, and the Wind uncon&s;tant, &s;o that we made but little way.</P>
<P>The fourth, by break of day we di&s;cover'd the Iland of <HI>Pantalarea.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth by Morning we found our &s;elves within a League and a half of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sicily,</HI> ju&s;t again&s;t <HI>Cape Pa&s;&s;aro,</HI> at what time, the Weather being fair, we had a view of Mount <HI>Gibello,</HI> all cover'd with Snow. Doubling the Cape in the Afternoon, we di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a.</HI> The &s;ixth we had little or no Wind. But the &s;eventh in the Morning, the Weather being fair, we di&s;cover'd Cape <HI>Spartivento;</HI> and the &s;ame Wind continuing all that day, toward Evening we &s;ail'd in view of other Ilands of <HI>Calabria.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth we found our &s;elves near to Cape <HI>Bor&s;ano,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the day we &s;ail'd in view of Cape <HI>Stillo</HI> and Cape <HI>delle Colonne.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth we made little way. But on the Tenth in the Morning the Wind coming about to the South, we found our &s;elves at the entry of the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> between Cape St. <HI>Mary</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Greece,</HI> where the Mountains were cover'd with Snow. About ten of the Clock we tack'd to our own Cour&s;e, while the Ships that were bound for <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Ancona</HI> entered the Gulf.</P>
<P>The tenth by Morning we &s;aw two little I&s;lands, the one call'd <HI>Fauno,</HI> the other <HI>Merlera,</HI> and were in &s;ight of <HI>Corfu.</HI> About Noon, the Wind being at Ea&s;t, we kept out at Sea: and about Evening abundance of little Birds lighted upon our Cordage, of which we caught enow to make a lu&s;ty Frica&s;ie. We al&s;o caught four Falcons, Owls, and good &s;tore of Turtles.</P>
<P>The eleventh and twelfth the Wind being at Ea&s;t, we lay hovering about the Shoar, without making any way.</P>
<P>The fourteenth and fifteenth having the Wind at North-We&s;t, we were two days without &s;eeing Land, yet we caught good &s;tore of Birds.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth the &s;ame Wind continuing, we found our &s;elves near the I&s;land of <HI>Zant.</HI> From eight in the Morning 'till three in the Afternoon we were becalm'd; but then a good brisk We&s;t Wind carry'd away all our little Birds.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth and eighteenth we were becalm'd.</P>
<P>The nineteenth in the Morning, the Wind being at North-We&s;t, we di&s;cover'd Cape <HI>Gullo,</HI> between <HI>Modon</HI> and <HI>Coron,</HI> in the <HI>Morea.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth, with the &s;ame Wind that blew fre&s;h, we found our &s;elves by Morning within two Cannon-&s;hot of Cape <HI>Matapan,</HI> which is the mo&s;t Southern Cape of all <HI>Europe.</HI> About Noon the Wind coming full We&s;t, in three hours we pa&s;s'd by the Point of the I&s;land <HI>Cerigo.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>A</HI> Continuation of the Author's &s;ixth Voyage, as he travel'd from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;taid at <HI>Smyrna</HI> from the twenty-fifth of <HI>April</HI> to the ninth of <HI>June;</HI> during which time there happ'nd &s;o terrible an Earthquake; that I had like to have tumbl'd out of my Bed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caravan</HI> being ready to &s;et out for <HI>Tauris,</HI> I took with me three <HI>Armenian</HI> Servants, be&s;ides tho&s;e that I carry'd out of <HI>France</HI> to &s;erve me upon the Road.</P>
<P>We &s;et out of <HI>Smyrna</HI> upon Monday the ninth of <HI>June</HI> at three a Clock in the afternoon. The <HI>Caravan</HI> rendevouz'd at <HI>Pont-garba&s;hi,</HI> three Leagues from the City, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix hundred Camels, and almo&s;t the &s;ame number of Hor&s;e. We &s;et out the next night, two hours after midnight. As for the Road I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, only relate &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages that fell out by the way.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Erivan,</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>September</HI> we encamp'd in a plea&s;ant green place between the Ca&s;tle and the old Town; for we would not lye in the Inn, becau&s;e we heard that &s;everal &s;ick people lodg'd there. We &s;taid there two days; during which time I re&s;olv'd to wait upon the <HI>Kan,</HI> I found him in a Room made in one of the Arches of the Bridge which is built over the River, which I have de&s;crib'd already, with &s;everal Captains and Officers about him: when he had ask'd me whence I came, and whither I was travelling, he caus'd a Gla&s;s of Liquor to be fill'd me. After that I pre&s;ented him with a Pro&s;pective-Gla&s;s, &s;ix pair of ordinary Spectacles, twelve other pair of Spectacles that ca&s;t &s;everal Reflexions, two little Pi&s;tols, and a Steel to &s;trike Fire, made like a Pi&s;tol. All which pleas'd him extremely well, e&s;pecially the Spectacles, for he was &s;ixty years of age. Thereupon he commanded a Lamb, Wine, Fruit, and Melons to be carry'd to my Tent, and that I &s;hould want nothing. After that we &s;ate down to Dinner, but I ob&s;erv'd the <HI>Kan</HI> him&s;elf drank no Wine, though he pre&s;s'd me to it. The rea&s;on was, becau&s;e he was an <HI>Agi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> that is, one that had made his Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> for then it is not lawful to drink Wine, or any other inebriating Drink. After Dinner, finding him in a plea&s;ant humour, I re&s;olv'd to complain to him of one of the Cu&s;tom-Officers about an injury he had done me. For it is u&s;ual with the Cu&s;tomer in this place to op'n the Che&s;ts of all the Merchants, both <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> to the end that if they have any thing of Rarity the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivan</HI> may &s;ee it: for many times, he buyes what plea&s;es him be&s;t to &s;end to the King. This Officer would not excu&s;e me for his Cu&s;tom, and therefore at my very fir&s;t arrival he would have me to op'n my Che&s;ts; and becau&s;e I did not do it according to his Orders, he ask'd me very rudely why I had not obey'd his Commands: I an&s;wer'd him as &s;urlily, that I would op'n my Che&s;t no where unle&s;s it were in the pre&s;ence of the King, and that as for him, I knew him not: Upon that he threaten'd me, that if he did not find my Che&s;ts op'n the next day, he would op'n them by force; thereupon I &s;aid no more, but bid him have a care I did not make him repent of what he had done already. This was the ground of the Quarrel, and I was about to have complain'd to the <HI>Kan;</HI> but his Nephew intreated me for the love I bare him, not to &s;ay any thing of it, and promis'd to &s;end the Cu&s;tomer to me to beg my Pardon, which he did, and the Cu&s;tomer was forc'd to crave it heartily. To avoid the &s;ame inconvenience for the future, I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Kan</HI> to give me his Pa&s;port, to the end I might pa&s;s Cu&s;tom|free
<PB N="103" REF="66">
through the Territories of his Government, which he freely and courteou&s;ly granted me: <HI>Come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and dine with me to morrow, and you &s;hall have it.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;ixth of <HI>September</HI> we departed from <HI>Erivan,</HI> and the ninth of <HI>Novem|ber</HI> we came to <HI>Tauris,</HI> taking the ordinary Road.</P>
<P>At <HI>Erivan</HI> two of my Servants, the one a Watch-maker, the other a Gold-&s;mith, dy'd; I left them &s;ick there, but caus'd them to be buried in the Church-yard belonging to the <HI>Armenians.</HI> One of them dy'd in fifteen days, of a Gangrene, which eat out his Mouth and Throat; being the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Country. Though had the <HI>Armenians</HI> known that one of them had been a Prote&s;tant, they would never have allow'd him to have been bury'd in their Church-yard.</P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve the exact Ju&s;tice, wherewith the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> pre&s;erve the Goods of Strangers. For the Civil Judge hearing of the death of the Watch-maker, caus'd his Chamber to be &s;eal'd up to the end the Goods might be pre&s;erv'd for the kindred of the deceas'd, if they came to demand them. I return'd to <HI>Tauris</HI> a twelve-month after, and found the Chamber clo&s;e &s;eal'd up.</P>
<P>We &s;taid twelve days at <HI>Tauris:</HI> during which time I re&s;olv'd to attend the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Shamaqui,</HI> a frontier Town of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> toward the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; but I found him not there, in regard it was Harve&s;t &s;ea&s;on, at what time he goes to gather the King's and his own Duties.</P>
<P>Two days journey on this &s;ide <HI>Shamaqui</HI> you pa&s;s the <HI>Aras,</HI> and for two days journey you travel through a Country all planted with white Mulberry-Trees; the Inhabitants being all Silk-Weavers. Before you come to the City, you mu&s;t cro&s;s over &s;everal Hills: But I think I &s;hould rather have call'd it a great Town, where there was nothing remarkable but a fair Ca&s;tle which the <HI>Kan</HI> built him&s;elf, I &s;peak of the time pa&s;t: For as I return'd from this pre&s;ent Voyage of which I now write, when I came to <HI>Tauris</HI> I under&s;tood, that there had happen'd &s;uch a terrible Earth|quake in the Town as had laid all the Hou&s;es in a heap; none e&s;caping that di&s;mal &s;ubver&s;ion, but only one Watch-maker of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and one more who was a Camel|driver. I had &s;everal times de&s;ign'd to return into <HI>France</HI> through <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> but I dur&s;t never adventure, being certainly inform'd that the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> never permitted any per&s;on to go out of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor to come out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Mu&s;|covy.</HI> So that it was by particular connivence that that favour was granted to the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adors. This la&s;t time I was re&s;olv'd to have try'd whe|ther I could have open'd a Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> through <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> but the Ruine of <HI>Shamaqui</HI> deterr'd me.</P>
<P>We departed from <HI>Tauris</HI> the twenty-&s;econd of <HI>November,</HI> from whence to <HI>Ca&s;han</HI> we met with nothing con&s;iderable, but only one of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors upon his return into his own Country, with a &s;mall Retinue of &s;ixty, his Companion dying at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>Upon Sunday the fourteenth of <HI>December</HI> taking Hor&s;e by three of the Clock in the morning, the Ice bearing very well, we came to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> about noon: but in regard it was &s;lippery before day, and very pla&s;hy after the Sun was up, the Journey was both tedious and trouble&s;om.</P>

<P>From <HI>Arzlan-chaye</HI> you go to <HI>Seuerak.</HI> This is a City, water'd by a River, that al&s;o falls into <HI>Euphrates.</HI> It is environ'd with a great Plain to the North, the We&s;t, and South. The way which the Hor&s;es, Mules, and Camels keep is cut through the Rock like a Channel, two Foot deep, where you mu&s;t al&s;o pay half a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> for every Hor&s;e-load.</P>
<P>From <HI>Seuerak</HI> you come to <HI>Bogazi,</HI> where there are two Wells, but not a Hou&s;e near; and where the <HI>Caravan</HI> u&s;ually lodges.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bogazi</HI> you come to <HI>Deguirman-Bogazi,</HI> and from <HI>Deguirman-Bogazi</HI> to <HI>Mirzatapa,</HI> where there is only an Inn.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mirzatapa</HI> you come to <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Car-emu.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Diarbequir</HI> is a City &s;ituated upon a ri&s;ing ground, on the right &s;ide of <HI>Tigris,</HI> which in that place forms a Half-moon; the de&s;cent from the Walls to the River being very &s;teep. It is encompa&s;s'd with a double Wall; the outward Wall being &s;trengthned with &s;ixty-two Towers, which they report were built in Honour of the &s;ixty two Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST. The City has but three Gates, over one of which there is an In&s;cription in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> that makes mention of one <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> There are in it two or three fair <HI>Piazza</HI>'s, and a magnificent <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which was formerly a Chri&s;tian Church. It is &s;urrounded with very decent Charnel-hou&s;es, near to which the <HI>Moullah's, Dervi's,</HI> Book-&s;ellers and Stationers do live, together with all tho&s;e other people that concern the Law. About a League from the City there is a Channel cut out of <HI>Tigris,</HI> that brings the Water to the City: And in this Water are all the red Marroquins wa&s;h'd that are made at <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in colour all others in the Ea&s;t: which Manufacture employs a fourth part of the Inhabitants of the City. The Soil is very good, and yields according to expectation; there is excellent Bread and very good Wine, nor is there any better Provi&s;ion to be had in any part of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> more e&s;pecially, there is a &s;ort of Pigeons which in goodne&s;s excel all the &s;everal kinds that we have in <HI>Europe.</HI> The City is very well peopl'd, and it is thought there are in it above twenty thou&s;and Chri&s;tians. The two thirds are <HI>Armenians,</HI> the re&s;t <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> with &s;ome few <HI>Jacobites.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ome few <HI>Capuchins,</HI> that have no Hou&s;e of their own, but are forc'd to lodge in an Inn.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Diarbequir</HI> is one of the <HI>Viziers</HI> of the Empire. He has but an incon|&s;iderable Infantry, which is not much requi&s;ite in that Country; the <HI>Curds</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> which infe&s;t that Country being all Hor&s;e-men. But he is &s;trong in Cavalry, being able to bring above twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e into the Field. A quarter of an hours riding on this &s;ide <HI>Diarbequir</HI> there is a great Town with a large Inn, where the <HI>Caravans</HI> that go and come from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> rather choo&s;e to lye than at <HI>Diarbequir;</HI> in regard that in the City-Inns, they pay three or four <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> for every Chamber, but in the Country-Inns there is nothing demanded.</P>
<P>At <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> you cro&s;s the <HI>Tigris,</HI> which is always fordable unle&s;s when the Snow and Rains have &s;well'd it; for then you mu&s;t go a quarter of a League higher, and cro&s;s it over a great Stone-Bridge. Half a League on the other &s;ide of <HI>Tigris</HI> &s;tands a Village, with an Inn, which is the Rendevous of the whole <HI>Caravan,</HI> and where they that fir&s;t come have time enough to provide them&s;elves for a Journey of nine or ten days, as far as <HI>Betlis.</HI> For though you may find Towns and Inns thick enough upon the Road, yet there is no good Bread to be met with.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caravan</HI> proceeds, the fir&s;t days journey is fourteen hours on Hor&s;e|back, and you come to lye at <HI>Shaye-batman,</HI> where you mu&s;t pay a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> for every Hor&s;e-load.</P>

<P>From <HI>Carakan</HI> to <HI>Betlis,</HI> a City belonging to a <HI>Bey</HI> or Prince of the Country, the mo&s;t potent and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the re&s;t for he neither acknowledges the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> nor the <HI>Per&s;ian:</HI> whereas all the other <HI>Beys</HI> are Tributary either to the one or the other. And it is the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e two Potentates to corre&s;pond with him; for it's an ea&s;ie thing for him to &s;top up the pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Tau|ris,</HI> or from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> the Streights of the Mountains being &s;o narrow, that ten Men may defend them again&s;t a thou&s;and. Coming near <HI>Betlis</HI> you mu&s;t travel a whole day among high &s;teep Mountains, that reach two miles beyond, with Torrents on each &s;ide; the way being cut out of the Rock on each &s;ide, where there is but ju&s;t room for a Camel to pa&s;s. The City &s;tands between two high Mountains, equally di&s;tant one from the other, and about the height of <HI>Montmartre.</HI> It is built like a Sugar-loaf, the a&s;cent being &s;o &s;teep on every &s;ide, that there is no getting to the top, but by wheeling and winding about the Mountain. The top of all is a Plat|form, where &s;tands a Ca&s;tle well built, at the Gate whereof is a Draw-Bridge. Then you pa&s;s through two great Courts, and then into a third, oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Bey</HI>'s Apartment. It is very trouble&s;om to get up to the top of the Ca&s;tle, and a Man mu&s;t be very well Hors'd that does it. There is no other per&s;on but the <HI>Bey</HI> and his E&s;quire, who is permitted to ride up on Hor&s;e back. There is one Inn within the City, and another as it were without, in which the Merchants rather choo&s;e to lye than in the other, by rea&s;on that it is ready to be overflown when the Torrents &s;well, that run throngh every Street. The <HI>Bey,</HI> be&s;ide the &s;trength of his Pa&s;&s;es, is able to bring above five and twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e into the Field; and a very con&s;iderable Body of Foot, compos'd of the Shepherds of the Country, who are to be ready at a Call. I went to wait upon the <HI>Bey</HI> him&s;elf, and made him a Pre&s;ent of two pieces of Satin, the one &s;treakt with Silver, and the other with Gold: two white Bonnets, &s;uch as the <HI>Turks</HI> wear, very fine, and adorn'd with Silver at the top; together with a &s;ute of Handkerchiffs, &s;treak'd with Red and Silver. While I &s;taid with the <HI>Bey,</HI> who &s;ent for Coffee for me according to the cu&s;tom, a Courier came to him from the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> to de&s;ire him that he would deliver up into his hands a <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon that was his Slave, having been tak'n in <HI>Candia;</HI> complaining withall, that he had run away from him with the value of three thou|&s;and Crowns. The <HI>Bey,</HI> who under&s;tood what belong'd to a Sanctuary, and was re&s;olv'd to protect the <HI>French-man,</HI> &s;chool'd the Me&s;&s;enger &s;o &s;everely, that he threaten'd to put him to death if he did not get him gone pre&s;ently; charging him to tell his Ma&s;ter withal, that he would complain to the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> of his in&s;o|lence; and that if he were &s;trangl'd, he might thank him&s;elf. And indeed it behov'd the Great <HI>Turk</HI> to keep fair corre&s;pondence with him; in regard that if the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;hould at any time be&s;iege <HI>Van,</HI> the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> mu&s;t march through the <HI>Bey</HI>'s Country to relieve it; who has Forces enow to oppo&s;e him if he &s;hould be his Enemy.</P>
<P>But to travel through the Country of the <HI>Curds</HI> is very plea&s;ant: for if on the one &s;ide the ways are bad, and difficult to be travell'd, in other places you have a pro&s;pect of &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, as Oaks and Walnuts, and not a Tree which is not embrac'd with a wild Vine. Below the Mountains, in the Level, grows the be&s;t Wheat and Bailey in all the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Betlis,</HI> where you pay five <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> for every Hor&s;e-load, to <HI>Taduan,</HI> where you pay two.</P>
<P><HI>Taduan</HI> is a great Town within a Cannon-&s;hot of the Lake of <HI>Van,</HI> in &s;uch a port, where Nature has made a Hav'n, &s;helter'd from all the Winds; being clos'd on all &s;ides with high Mountains, the entry into which though it &s;eem narrow, is very free. It is able to contain twenty or thirty great Barks; and when it is fair Wea|ther, and that the Wind &s;erves, the Merchants generally Ship off their Goods from thence to <HI>Van:</HI> from whence it is but four and twenty hours &s;ail, and a very good pa&s;&s;age; whereas by Land from <HI>Taduan</HI> to <HI>Van</HI> it is eight days journey on Hor&s;e-back.

<P>From <HI>Devan</HI> to <HI>Van,</HI> where there is a Duty of two <HI>Tomans</HI> and four <HI>Aba&s;&s;is</HI> to be paid for every Hor&s;e-load. For though <HI>Van</HI> be in the Territories of the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> yet the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Money is better lik'd than his own Coyn.</P>
<P><HI>Van</HI> is a great City upon the &s;ide of a wide Lake of the &s;ame name. There is a good Fortre&s;s belongs to it, that is &s;eated upon the top of a high Mountain which &s;tands by it &s;elf. There is but one &s;ort of Fi&s;h in the Lake, a little bigger than a Pilchard, of which they take great &s;tore in the Month of <HI>April.</HI> For about a League from the Lake there is a great River that is call'd <HI>Bendmahi,</HI> which de|&s;cending from the Mountains of <HI>Armenia,</HI> empties it &s;elf into the Lake. Now in <HI>March</HI> when the Snow melts and &s;wells the River, va&s;t numbers of the&s;e Fi&s;h come down the River into the Lake; which the Fi&s;her-men ob&s;erving, &s;o &s;top up the Mouth of the River that the Fi&s;h cannot go back; for el&s;e they would not &s;tay above forty days; at which time they catch 'em up in wide-mouth'd Baskets at the Mouth of the River, thinking to return; it being lawful for any man to fi&s;h. The people drive a great Trade in the&s;e Fi&s;h, tran&s;porting them into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Armenia;</HI> for, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> both, drinking Wine at the end of their Fea&s;ts, they then bring this Di&s;h to the Table for a Reli&s;hing-bit. The people of <HI>Van</HI> tell a Story, how that there was a certain rich Merchant who farm'd the whole Fi&s;hery, paying a good &s;um of Money for it to the <HI>Ba&s;ha;</HI> who thereupon &s;trictly forbad any to fi&s;h but the Merchant; whereas before it was free for any man. But when the Fi&s;hing-&s;ea&s;on came, and that the Merchant thought to have caught his Fi&s;h, he met with nothing but Serpents. So that after that time the Fi&s;hery was never more farm'd. And there &s;ems to be &s;omething in it; for the <HI>Ba&s;ha's,</HI> who are a &s;ort of people that will lo&s;e nothing they can get, would be certain to farm the Fi&s;h again and again, were there not &s;ome &s;trange rea&s;on to hinder it. There are two principal I&s;lands in the Lake of <HI>Van;</HI> the one call'd <HI>Adaketons,</HI> where there &s;tand two Covents of the <HI>Armenians, Sourphague</HI> and <HI>Sourp&punc;kara:</HI> the other I&s;land is call'd <HI>Limada&s;i,</HI> and the name of the Covent is <HI>Limquilia&s;i,</HI> all which <HI>Armenian</HI> Monks live very au&s;terely.</P>
<P>From <HI>Van</HI> to <HI>Darcheck.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Darcheck</HI> to <HI>Nuchar;</HI> it &s;tands in the Territories of a <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> being a paltry Village con&s;i&s;ting of two or three little Hou&s;es. The&s;e <HI>Bey's</HI> are a kind of particular Lords, upon the Frontiers of both the Empires of <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who care for neither: for they lye &s;o &s;ecure among the Mountains, that there is no a&s;&s;aulting them by force. The <HI>Curds</HI> in general are a bruti&s;h &s;ort of people; who though they &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>Mahometans,</HI> have very few <HI>Moullah's</HI> to In&s;truct or teach them. They have a particular veneration for black Grey-hounds: &s;o that if any per&s;on &s;hould be &s;een to kill one of them, he would be knock'd o'the Head immediately. Neither does any one dare to cut an Onion with a Knife in their pre&s;ence; but it mu&s;t be &s;queez'd between two Stones by him that intends to make u&s;e of it; &s;o ridiculou&s;ly &s;uper&s;titious they are.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bey</HI> to whom <HI>Nuchar</HI> belongs has his Toll-gatherers in that place, who exact &s;ixteen <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's</HI> for every Hor&s;e-load, be&s;ides a Pre&s;ent which the <HI>Caravan-Ba&s;hi</HI> is oblig'd to pre&s;ent him, which comes &s;ometimes to &s;even or eight <HI>Tomans:</HI> &s;ome|times more: for otherwi&s;e the <HI>Bey</HI> would be &s;ure to watch the <HI>Caravan</HI> at &s;ome &s;curvy place, and plunder it to &s;ome purpo&s;e. As once it happen'd to a <HI>Caravan,</HI> with which my Nephew went along in the year 1672; though he had the good luck to lo&s;e nothing more than one Camel laden with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, and another with his Provi&s;ion. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Van</HI> and the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Tauris</HI> took the Field with an intention to remedy the&s;e di&s;orders: e&s;pecially the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Van,</HI> who perceiving that the Merchants would for&s;ake that Road by rea&s;on of the Injuries they daily

This bad way brings Fifty i'the Hundred profit to the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Nuchar;</HI> for were the <HI>Caravan</HI> to travel through Plains, or a level Country, one Hor&s;e or Camel would carry as much as two or three, and the Merchant would pay Cu&s;tom for no more.

Under the Rock, which is hollow, appears a Fountain of clear cold Water, wherein there was great &s;tore of Fi&s;h; thou&s;ands of which would come up to the top of the Water, when a man threw any Bread into it.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Road from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> through the &s;mall De&s;ert, and through <HI>Kengavar.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Will de&s;cribe this Road as if I were to return from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Aleppo.</HI> This Road lies through <HI>Kengavar, Bagdat,</HI> and <HI>Anna,</HI> where you enter into the De&s;ert, which I call <HI>The little De&s;art,</HI> becau&s;e you get over it in far le&s;s time than the great De&s;ert that extends Southwards to <HI>Arabia the Happy,</HI> and where you may often find Water, all the whole Journey being not far di&s;tant from the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI> A man that is well mounted may ride this way from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Aleppo</HI> in three and thirty day, as I have done, and perhaps in le&s;s, if the <HI>Arabian,</HI> whom you take for your guide at <HI>Bagdat,</HI> knows the &s;horte&s;t cut through the Wilder|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e <HI>Caravans</HI> travelling from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Kengaver</HI> are fourteen or fifteen days upon the Road; but being well mounted ten or twelve in a Company, you may Ride it in five or &s;ix days. The Country through which you travel, is very fertile in Corn and Rice, it produces al&s;o excellent Fruits and good Wine, e&s;peci|ally about <HI>Kengavar,</HI> which is a large Town well peopl'd.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kengavar</HI> to <HI>Bagdat</HI> I was ten days upon the Road. The Country is not &s;o fertile but very &s;tony in &s;ome parts. And it con&s;i&s;ts in Plains and &s;mall Hills, there being not a Mountain in all the Road.</P>
<P>Now for a man that travels quick, the Road lies thus:</P>
<P>From <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Con&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Con&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Comba.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Comba</HI> to <HI>Orangui&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Orangui&eacute;</HI> to <HI>Naho&uuml;and.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Naho&uuml;and</HI> to <HI>Kengavar.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Kengavar</HI> to <HI>Sahana.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Sahana</HI> to <HI>Poli&s;ha,</HI> or the Bridge-Royal, being a great Stone Bridge.</P>
<P>From <HI>Poli&s;ha</HI> to <HI>Maidacht.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Maidacht</HI> to <HI>Erounabad.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Erounabad</HI> to <HI>Conaguy.</HI></P>

<P>From <HI>Charaban</HI> to <HI>Bourous.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Bourous</HI> to <HI>Bagdat.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Kengavar,</HI> take <HI>Amadan,</HI> one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in their way, and &s;o from thence to <HI>Toucher&eacute;;</HI> but the way is longer; and according to the Road which I have &s;et down you are to leave <HI>Amadan</HI> to the North upon the right hand.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Sahana</HI> and <HI>Poli&s;ha</HI> you leave the only high Mountain in all the Road to the North. It is as &s;teep and as &s;traight as a Wall, and as high as you can &s;ee; you may ob&s;erve the Figures of men clad like Prie&s;ts, with Surplices and Cen&s;ors in their hands, and yet neither can the Natives tell you, nor any per&s;on imagin the meaning of tho&s;e Sculptures. At the foot of the Rock runs a River, over which there is Bridge of Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="70">
About a days journey beyond the Mountain you meet with a little City, who&s;e &s;ituation, the Streams that water it, the good Fruits that grow there, and parti|cularly the excellent Wine which it affords, render a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Man&s;ion. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> believe that <HI>Alexander</HI> when he return'd from <HI>Babylon</HI> dy'd in this place, what-ever others have writt'n that he dy'd at <HI>Babylon.</HI> All the re&s;t of the Country from this City to <HI>Bagdat</HI> is a Country of Dates, where the people live in little Hutts, made of the Branches of Palm-trees.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Anna</HI> you ride in four days, through a de&s;ert Country, though it lye between two Rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Anna</HI> is a City of an indifferent bigne&s;s, that belongs to an <HI>Arabian Emir.</HI> For about half a League round about the Town, the Lands are very well manur'd, being full of Gardens and Country-hou&s;es. The City for its &s;ituation re&s;embles <HI>Paris;</HI> for it is built upon both &s;ides of the River <HI>Euphrates;</HI> and in the mid&s;t of the River is an I&s;land, where &s;tands a fair <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Anna</HI> to <HI>Mached-raba</HI> is five days riding, and from <HI>Mached-raba</HI> to <HI>Ta&iuml;ba,</HI> five days more.</P>
<P><HI>Mached-raba</HI> is a kind of a Fortre&s;s upon the point of a Hill, at the Foot whereof &s;prings a Fountain like a large Va&s;e, which is very rare in the De&s;erts. The place is encompa&s;s'd with high Walls, defended by certain Towers, and in which are little Hutts where the Inhabitants keep their Cattel, of which there is great &s;tore, but more Mares and Hor&s;es than Cows.</P>
<P><HI>Ta&iuml;ba</HI> is al&s;o a fortifi'd place in a level Country, or a high Bank of Earth and Brick bak'd in the Sun. Near to the Gate a Fountain &s;prings out of the Earth, and makes a kind of a Pond. This Road is mo&s;t frequented by tho&s;e that travel through the De&s;ert from <HI>Aleppo</HI> or <HI>Damas</HI> to <HI>Babylon,</HI> or from <HI>Damas</HI> to <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> by rea&s;on of this Fountain.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ta&iuml;ba</HI> to <HI>Aleppo</HI> is but three days journey; but the&s;e three days are the mo&s;t dangerous of all the Road for Robbers, in regard that all the Country is inha|bited only by the <HI>Bedou&iuml;ns,</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Shepherds, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s only to plunder and &s;teal.</P>

<P>So that whether you travel from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> or from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Aleppo</HI> you may ea&s;ily ride it in thirty days.</P>
<P>From whence I make this Ob&s;ervation, That a man making it but two days more from <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> and finding a Ship ready there to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> with a fair Wind he may travel from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Paris</HI> in two months.</P>
<P>Another time, having an occa&s;ion to go from <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Kengavar,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Bagdat;</HI> and from thence, &s;o through the De&s;ert; at <HI>Bagdat</HI> I met with a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that was travelling the &s;ame way, with whom I luckily met to bear half the Charges of the Guide; which as &s;oon as we had hir'd for &s;ixty Crowns, we &s;et forward from
<PB N="111" REF="70">
<HI>Bagdat;</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and I, and our <HI>Arabian,</HI> who was afoot, walk'd about a Pi&s;tol Shot before our Hor&s;es. From thence to <HI>Anna</HI> we met with nothing remarkable, but only that we &s;aw a Lyon and a Lyone&s;s in the Act of Generation: Whereupon our Guide, believing we had been afraid, told us, that he had met them oft'n, but that he never found them do any harm.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> according to the humour of his Nation, was very re&s;erv'd, and contenting him&s;elf with an Onion, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;mall matter at meals, never made much of his guide; whereas I was mightily in his favour, in regard there was never a day pa&s;s'd wherein he did not receive of me &s;ome good bu&s;ine&s;s or other. We were not above a Mu&s;quet Shot from <HI>Anna</HI> when we met with a comely old man, who came up to me, and taking my Hor&s;e by the Bridle; Friend, &s;aid he, come and wa&s;h thy feat and eat Bread at my Hou&s;e. Thou art a Stranger, and &s;ince I have met thee upon the Road, never refu&s;e me the favour which I de&s;ire of thee. The Invitation of the old man was &s;o like the cu&s;tom of the people in ancient times, of which we read &s;o many Examples in Scripture, that we could not choo&s;e but go along with him to his Hou&s;e, where he Fea&s;ted us in the be&s;t manner he could, giving us over and above Barly for our Hor&s;es; and for us he kill'd a Lamb and &s;ome Hens. He was an Inhabitant of <HI>Anna,</HI> and liv'd by the River, which we were oblig'd to cro&s;s to wait upon the Governour for our Pa&s;&s;ports, for which we paid two <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> apiece. We &s;taid at a Hou&s;e near the Gate of the City to buy Provi&s;ions for our &s;elves and our Hor&s;es; where the woman of the Hou&s;e having a lovely &s;prightly Child of nine years of age, I was &s;o taken with her humour, that I gave her two Handkerchiefs of Painted Calicut, which the Child &s;hewing her Mother, all we could do could not make her take any Money for the Provi&s;ions we had agreed for.</P>
<P>Five hundred paces from the Gate of the City, we met a young man of a good Family, for he was attended by two Servants, and rode upon an A&s;s, the hinder part of which was Painted red. He acco&s;ted me in particular, and after &s;ome Compliments that pa&s;s'd, <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I &s;hould meet a Stranger, and have nothing to pre&s;ent him withal?</HI> He would fain have carry'd us to a Hou&s;e in the Country whither he was going; but &s;eeing we were re&s;olv'd to keep our way, he would needs give me his Pipe, notwith&s;tanding all the excu&s;es I could make, and though I told him that I never took any Tobacco; &s;o that I was con&s;train'd to accept of it.</P>
<P>About three Leagues from <HI>Anna,</HI> we were going to eat among the Ruines of certain Hou&s;es, and had thought to have lain there 'till midnight, when we perceiv'd two <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;ent by the <HI>Emir,</HI> to tell us that he had &s;ome Letters which he would put into our own hands to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> to which purpo&s;e he had order to bring us back. There was no refu&s;ing, &s;o that at our coming into the City the next day we &s;aw the <HI>Emir</HI> going to the <HI>Mo&s;qu&eacute;e,</HI> mounted upon a &s;tately Hor&s;e, and attended by a great number of people afoot, with every one a great Poniard &s;tuck in their Girdles. As &s;oon as we &s;aw him we alighted, and &s;tanding up by the Hou&s;es, we &s;aluted him as he pa&s;s'd by. Seeing our Guide, and threatning to rip up is Belly; <HI>Ye Dog,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I will give ye your reward, and teach ye to carry Strangers away before I &s;ee them.</HI> Carry them, &s;aid he, to the Governours Hou&s;e 'till I return from the <HI>Mo&s;qu&eacute;e.</HI> Returning from the <HI>Mo&s;qu&eacute;e,</HI> and being &s;eated in a &s;pacious Hall, he &s;ent for us and our Guide, whom he threatned again for carrying us out of the Town without giving him notice. But the Governour pleaded his excu&s;e, and appeas'd the <HI>Emir.</HI> After that he &s;ent for Coffee for us, and then caus'd us to open the Budget that we carry'd behind our Hor&s;es, to &s;ee whether there were any thing that pleas'd him or no. In my Budget were two pieces of Calicut exqui&s;itely painted, for two Coverlets of a Bed; two pieces of Handkerchief of Calicut; two <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Standi&s;hes beautify'd with <HI>Japon</HI> Varni&s;h; two Dama&s;cene Blades, one inlaid with Gold, the other with Silver. All which he lik'd, and made me give him. In the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Budget he found nothing but a few old Clothes: But afterwards being known to have had &s;ome Diamonds about him, the <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> at <HI>Aleppo</HI> &s;entenc'd him to pay me half the charges of what I gave the <HI>Emir.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince &s;atisfi'd with what he had tak'n, gave order that we &s;hould be fur|ni&s;h'd with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions for our &s;elves and our Hor&s;es: but being provided
<PB N="112" REF="71">
before, we only took three or four handfuls of excellent Dates, to &s;hew that we did not flight his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Anna</HI> and <HI>Mached-raba</HI> is the Guide to take &s;pecial care &s;o to order his Stages, as to come every morning to the Wells by break of day, for fear of meeting the <HI>Arabs,</HI> that come to fetch Water there by that time the Sun is up, who are apt enough to be injurious to Travellers.</P>
<P>At <HI>Mached-raba</HI> I &s;aw one of the mo&s;t beautiful Virgins that ever I beheld in my life.&punc; For I had given a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> to an <HI>Arab</HI> to get me &s;ome Bread, and going to &s;ee whether it were bak'd, I found the Virgin putting it into the Oven, who being alone, made me a &s;ign to retire. There I al&s;o &s;aw a Colt of that wonderful &s;hape, that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Damas</HI> had offer'd three thou&s;and Crowns for it.</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Ta&iuml;ba,</HI> we did not go into the Town, but lay without under the Walls. Only our <HI>Arab</HI> went in and brought us chopt Straw for our Camels. The Governour of the Town came along with him, and demanded twenty <HI>Pia&s;ters</HI> of every one, for certain Duties which he pretended payable to him. We knew there were but four due, and refus'd to pay any more; but the <HI>Arab</HI> having a mind to put a trick upon the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> gave me a wink, intimating to me that I &s;hould not trouble my &s;elf: Thereupon the Governour incens'd goes back to the Town, and by and by returns with an Iron Chain; and had certainly carry'd the <HI>Spaniard</HI> fetter'd to the Fort, had he not laid down the twenty <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI> For my part, I was di&s;charg'd for my four <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> according to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Drawing near to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the fir&s;t Hou&s;es that we came at bordering upon the De&s;ert were the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Bedo&uuml;ins;</HI> the &s;econd of which being the Habitation of a Friend of our Guide's, I deliver'd my Hor&s;e to the Guide, to whom I had &s;old it before at his own earne&s;t reque&s;t; for I was re&s;olv'd to go a-foot to <HI>Aleppo:</HI> and therefore that I might &s;ave the Cu&s;tom of a parcel of Turquoi&s;es that I had about me, I put them in the Pouches which I carry'd behind my Hor&s;e, and threw the Pouches into a little Che&s;t, as if they had been things of no con&s;equence; and de&s;ir'd the Man of the Hou&s;e to keep them a day or two. The <HI>Arab</HI> told me, that were it all Gold it &s;hould be &s;afe; and indeed when I &s;ent for them within a day or two after, I found nothing mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul ask'd me what news from <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> I made an&s;wer, that he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity know better than I, in regard the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident there had &s;ent away an Expre&s;s to him while I was there; and that he went away with two <HI>Capuchins</HI> and an <HI>Arabian</HI> Guide. There upon the Con&s;ul mi&s;|tru&s;ting &s;ome mi&s;chief was befal'n them, reque&s;ted the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> to lend him &s;ome of his Soldiers; who readily granted him eight Men, part <HI>Arabians,</HI> part <HI>Bedo&uuml;ins.</HI> The&s;e the Con&s;ul order'd to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves upon &s;everal Roads in the Wilderne&s;s, to &s;ee if they could meet with any tidings upon the Way. In a &s;hort time two of them return'd with two little Pouches, in one of which was the Packet of Letters. They reported al&s;o, that in a by-place between <HI>Ta&iuml;ba</HI> and <HI>Mached-raba</HI> they &s;aw the Bodies of four dead Men lying upon the Sand. One of them which was in black Clothes, being hack'd and mangled in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable manner; but the Bodies of the other three were entire, though run through in &s;everal places. Some time after the per&s;ons them&s;elves that did the fact told both at <HI>Diarbequir</HI> and <HI>Damas,</HI> how it came to pa&s;s. For certain Merchants of <HI>Damas</HI> going to <HI>Diarbequir,</HI> perceiv'd four Men early in the morning at certain Wells where they were to &s;top; whereupon they &s;ent two of their Company before to know who they were. But the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Frier having a little parcel of Diamonds about him, and believing them to be Thieves, incon&s;iderately let fly his Gun and kill'd one of them immediately upon the place: the Merchants &s;eeing one of their companions dead, fell all at once upon the other three, cut the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Frier to pieces, and flew the re&s;t; and &s;o without rifling them pur&s;u'd their Journey.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aleppo</HI> I went to <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> and there embarqu'd in a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> with a favourable Wind, 'till we came to make the Coa&s;t of <HI>Candy,</HI> where we were becalm'd for two days. One morning by break of day we di&s;cover'd a Pickaroon, whereupon &s;eeing we could not avoid being fetch'd up by him, we made ready. He made two or three &s;hot at us, which did us no other harm but only touch'd the Beak-head of the Ship. Our Gunner made a &s;hot at him, which brought down his Top-gallant; a&s;econd went through and through the great Carbin,
<PB N="113" REF="71">
and caus'd a great di&s;order in his Ship, as far as we could di&s;cern with our Pro&s;pective-Gla&s;&s;es. But when the Wind began to blow fre&s;h, the Pirate, who had enough of us, and had di&s;cover'd another Ve&s;&s;el which perhaps he thought better prize, made all the Sail he could from us toward the other Ve&s;&s;el. Thereupon we pur&s;u'd our Voyage with a fair Gale, and came to <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Malta</HI> we departed &s;even or eight in company, in two of the Pope's Gallies, &s;taying three days at <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> and one at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> where our Company increa&s;ing, we hir'd a Feluck for <HI>Naples.</HI> But as we were coa&s;ting by the Shoar to the Port of <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;o terrible a Tempe&s;t &s;urpriz'd us near to <HI>Paolo,</HI> that we were forc'd to put in there upon <HI>Palm-Sunday.</HI> The next day we went to &s;ee the Covent of St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Paolo;</HI> the way to it lying between a high Mountain on the right, and a Precipice on the left hand. This Mountain leans &s;o, that it &s;eems to be tumbling down; and there is a good height upon the Rock the &s;eeming print of a Hand, which as the report goes, was the print of St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s Hand, who &s;u&s;tain'd it a whole day, and kept it from falling. From <HI>Paolo</HI> we went to <HI>Naples,</HI> where we arriv'd upon <HI>Ea&s;ter-eve;</HI> and as we enter'd into the City, the great Guns went off round the City, in honour of the Re&s;urrection.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the ISLAND of <HI>CANDY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUT of the I&s;land of <HI>Candy</HI> Strangers export great &s;tore of Wheat and Sallet-Oyl, all &s;orts of Pul&s;e, Chee&s;e, yellow Wax, Cottons, Silks, but more e&s;pecially Malm&s;ey, wherein con&s;i&s;ts its chiefe&s;t Trade. When Vintage draws near, the Country-people that are to gather the Grapes wrap their Feet in a piece of a Boar's Skin, which they tye together upon the upper part of the Foot with a piece of Pack-thred, to pre&s;erve their Feet from the violent heat of the Rocks upon which they are to tread. Tho&s;e Skins are brought out of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> that bring Botargo and Caviare to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where they have a va&s;t vent for it all over <HI>Turky, Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> where they that follow the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Church, eat little or nothing el&s;e all the <HI>Lent.</HI> By the way take notice, that the <HI>Turks</HI> make a certain Glew out of Sturgeon, which is the be&s;t in the World, &s;o that whatever is fa&s;ten'd with it, will rather break in another place than where it is glew'd. They make it thus: When they have caught a Sturgeon, they pull out his Guts, and then there remains a Skin that covers the Fle&s;h; this Skin they take off from the head to the belly. It is very clammy, and about the thick|ne&s;s of two Sheets of Paper, which they roll as thick as a Man's Arm, and let it dry in the Sun. When they u&s;e it, they beat it with a Mallet, and when it is well beat'n they break it into pieces, and &s;teep it in Water for half an hour in a little Pot.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Venetians</HI> were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Candy,</HI> they that had committed any Crime which de&s;erv'd Death, if they could get out of the I&s;land before they were appre|hended
<PB N="119" REF="74">
went directly to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to beg their pardon. For you mu&s;t know, that no per&s;on but the Amba&s;&s;ador of the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI> had the Pri|viledge to pardon Crimes committed in <HI>Candy.</HI> For example, when Signor <HI>Der|vi&s;ano</HI> was Amba&s;&s;ador for the Common-wealth of <HI>Venice</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a <HI>Candiot</HI> having a de&s;ire to lye with a Woman by force, &s;he told him &s;he would &s;ooner eat her Child's Liver than yield to his Lu&s;t. Whereupon, the Villain enrag'd he could not compa&s;s his de&s;ign, took his opportunity, kill'd the Child, cut out the Liver, and made the Mother eat it, and then &s;lew the Mother al&s;o. Upon this he fled to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> to beg pardon of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and obtain'd it there: But the Amba&s;&s;ador at the &s;ame time wrote word to the Governour of <HI>Candy</HI> to put him to death at his return; having only granted him his Pardon, to pre&s;erve his Priviledge. And indeed, to &s;peak truth, the <HI>Candiots</HI> are the mo&s;t wretched people under Heaven.</P>

<HEAD>Of the ISLAND of <HI>CHIO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>Chio,</HI> which gives the I&s;land its Name, contains about thirty thou|&s;and Inhabitants; where there are little le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Greeks,</HI> eight thou&s;and <HI>Latins,</HI> and &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Among the &s;everal <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches, the la&s;t of which hath continu'd ever &s;ince the time that the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the I&s;land, there are &s;ome indifferent hand&s;om Structures. The five principal <HI>Latin</HI> Churches are the Cathedral, and the Churches belonging to the <HI>E&s;colantines,</HI> the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> and the <HI>Capuchins.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> have al&s;o their <HI>Mo&s;que&eacute;s,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> their <HI>Synagogue.</HI></P>
<P>Four Miles from the City, near to the Sea-&s;ide is to be &s;een a va&s;t Stone, which was cut out of &s;ome Rock; it is almo&s;t all round, only the upper part, which is flat, and &s;omewhat hollow; round about the upper part, and in the middle, are places like Seats, cut into the &s;ame Stone; of which there is one higher than the re&s;t, like a School-ma&s;ter's Chair; and Tradition reports that this was <HI>Homer</HI>'s School, where he taught this Scholars.</P>
<P>In this I&s;land there is &s;uch an infinite number of Partridges that the like is not to be found in any part of the World. But that which is a greater Rarity is this, that the Natives breed them up, as we do our Poultry, but after a more plea&s;ant manner; for they let them go in the fields all the day long, and at night every Country-man calls his own &s;everally home to Roo&s;t by a particular Note, whither they return like a Flock of &s;o many Gee&s;e.</P>

<P>Three Leagues from the I&s;land of <HI>Chio,</HI> upon a Mountain to the South there grows a peculiar &s;ort of Trees; the Leaves are &s;omewhat like a Myrtle, their Branches &s;o long that they creep upon the ground; but which is more wonderful, that when they are down, they ri&s;e again of them&s;elves. From the beginning of <HI>May</HI> to the end of <HI>June,</HI> the Inhabitants take great care to keep the Earth under the Tree very clean; for during tho&s;e two Months there i&s;&s;ues out a certain Gum from the joynts of the Branches, which drops upon the ground; this is that which we call <HI>Ma&s;tick,</HI> and the <HI>Turks, Sakes,</HI> according to the Name which they give the I&s;land. The I&s;land produces great &s;tore of this <HI>Ma&s;tick,</HI> which is &s;pent in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where the Women continually chew it, to clean&s;e and keep their Teeth white. When the <HI>Ma&s;tick</HI> Sea&s;on draws near, the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> every year &s;ends a certain number of <HI>Be&s;tangi's</HI> to take care that it be not exported, but be pre|&s;erv'd for the u&s;e of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> If it be a plentiful year for <HI>Ma&s;tick,</HI> the <HI>Be&s;tangi's</HI> that cull out the le&s;&s;er &s;ort to &s;ell, put it into little Bags and &s;eal it up; which Bags being &s;o &s;eal'd, are never que&s;tion'd by the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers.

<HEAD>A Particular Relation of the Gallies belonging to the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI> as well at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as in the I&s;les and other Parts of the Empire.</HEAD>
<P>FOrmerly there lay in the Road of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> above a hundred and fifty Gal|leys: But the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> perceiving that &s;o great a number did but cau&s;e confu&s;ion, and that the Captain-<HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> could not conveniently take &s;o great a burden as to look after &s;uch a number, he gave order that no more than twenty-four &s;hould lie in the Port of <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> &s;ending the re&s;t to other Ports, as well of the Con|tinent, as the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the Number of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Gallies is four&s;core, thus di&s;tributed under the Command of their &s;everal <HI>Beys</HI> or Captains.</P>
<P>At <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> twenty-four under the Command of the Captain-<HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> or Ad|miral of the Sea; who when he goes out upon any Expedition, &s;ends to the re&s;t to meet him according to Orders. When he goes in per&s;on to Sea, he gives to every one of his Slaves be&s;ides their ordinary Habit a kind of Ca&s;&s;ock of Red Cloth, and a Bonnet of the &s;ame colour. But this is only in the Admiral's Gally, and at his own Co&s;t. His Gally carries u&s;ually 366 Slaves, and to every Seat of the Row|ers, a <HI>Bonne Vole.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Bonne Voles</HI> are certain Volunteers that freely offer them|&s;elves to the Service of the Admiral, and there is great care taken for their being well paid. Their Pay is 3500 <HI>A&s;pers</HI> for their Voyage, which generally continues &s;even or eight Months. They feed as the other Slaves; but if they Row negligent|ly or lazily, they are beaten wor&s;e than the Slaves; for the Volunteers have nothing to do except it be to Row: But the Slaves are put to &s;everal other Duties. Take notice al&s;o that the Volunteers that &s;erve in the General's Gally, have 500 <HI>A&s;pers</HI> more than tho&s;e in the other Gallies, that is to &s;ay, 4000 <HI>A&s;pers</HI> for their Voyage, which comes to 40 Crowns.</P>
<P>The Reer-Admiral carries Two hundred and fifty men, as well Slaves as Volun|teers. That Galley and the great <HI>Tefterdar</HI>'s or Trea&s;urers, are the be&s;t provided of any in the whole Fleet: For the Reer-Admiral <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> has his choice to take four of the be&s;t men out of every Galley for his own, or el&s;e to receive 3500 <HI>A&s;pers</HI> for every man, which is paid by the Captain of the Galley; which makes him the riche&s;t of all the <HI>Beys.</HI></P>
<P>The great <HI>Tefterder</HI>'s Galley is one of the Twenty four Galleys of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and he &s;ends a particular Trea&s;urer, in the quality of a Lieutenant, to command her. That Command is very much conte&s;ted for, in regard that Galley is very well provided with all things; and for that all the Captains Court the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> who, when the Galleys return to Port, rewards them according to their Merit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Janizary-Aga</HI>'s Galley is of the &s;ame number; but he never goes to Sea, always &s;ending one in his room.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Relation of the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Georgia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>GEORGIA,</HI> which others call <HI>Gurg&iuml;e,</HI> or <HI>Gurgi&s;tan,</HI> extends Ea&s;tward to the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; and upon the We&s;t is bounded by Mountains that part it from <HI>Mengrelia.</HI> Formerly it was a Kingdom, all the Inhabi|tants whereof were Chri&s;tians, of the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church; but of late the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have got footing among them. And the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> having fill'd them full of Divi&s;ions, has made two Kingdoms of it, which he calls Provinces; over which he has plac'd two Governors. They are ge|nerally Princes of the Country, who mu&s;t turn <HI>Mahometans</HI> before they can be ad|mitted to that Dignity. When they are advanc'd, they take upon them the title of Kings; and while they have any I&s;&s;ue, the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> cannot di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s their Children.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Potent of the&s;e two Kings, is he that re&s;ides at <HI>Teflis,</HI> who in the Lan|guage of the Country is call'd the King of <HI>Cartel&eacute;.</HI> The pre&s;ent King is the la&s;t that has continu'd a Chri&s;tian, with his four Sons; the Elde&s;t of which, the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> having entic'd to Court, partly by Promi&s;es, and partly by Pre&s;ents, has won to <HI>Mahumeti&s;m.</HI> Immediately thereupon, he caus'd him to be declar'd King of the other Province.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Kings have each of them a Guard of <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Hor&s;e-men under their own pay; and at pre&s;ent I believe there are in both Kingdoms near upon 12000 <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Families.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Teflis</HI> coyns Money in the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Name; and the Silver which he coyns, is in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Reals, <HI>French</HI> Crowns, and &s;uch other Money, which the <HI>Armenians</HI> bring out of <HI>Europe</HI> for their Goods. As to the Ju&s;tice of the Countrey, neither the King him&s;elf, nor the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have any thing to do
<PB N="124" REF="77">
with it. A thief is acquitted, paying &s;even-fold what he has &s;tole; two parts whereof go to the Party robb'd, one part to the Judges, and four parts to the King. If the Thief has not wherewithal to make re&s;titution, he is fold: If the Product do not yet equal the Sum, if he have a Wife and Children, they fir&s;t &s;ell the Wife, and if that will not do, then they &s;ell the Children: But if the Party robb'd be &s;o merciful, as to forgive the Thief his &s;hare, then neither the King nor the Judges can demand any thing for their &s;hare. If any man commit a Murder, they condemn him to die, and deliver him up into the hands of the Kindred of the Party &s;lain, to do Execution as they plea&s;e them&s;elves. However, it is in their power to par|don him, if he be able to give &s;ixty Cows or more to the next a-kin to the Party kill'd. In matter of Debt, a Creditor has Power to &s;eize upon all the E&s;tate of the Debtor; and if that will not &s;atisfie, he may &s;ell his Wife and Children.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians of <HI>Georgia</HI> are very ignorant, e&s;pecially in Matters of Religion. They learn that little they know, in the Mona&s;teries, as al&s;o to write and read; and generally the Women and Maids are more knowing than the Men; not only be|cau&s;e there are more Religious Hou&s;es for Women than for Men, but al&s;o becau&s;e the Boys are bred up to labour, or &s;ent to the Wars. For if a Virgin grows up, and happens to be hand&s;om, &s;ome one or other pre&s;ently endeavors to &s;teal her, on pur|po&s;e to &s;ell her into <HI>Turky, Per&s;ia,</HI> or the Territories of the great <HI>Mogul.</HI> So that to prevent their being &s;toln, their Fathers and Mothers put them very young into Nunneries, where they apply them&s;elves to &s;tudy; wherein, if they attain to any proficiency, they u&s;ually &s;tay as long as they live: After that, they profe&s;s, and when they come to a certain Age, they are permitted to Baptize, and to apply the holy Oyls, as well as any Bi&s;hop or Arch-Bi&s;hop can do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Georgians</HI> are very great Drinkers; and Nature has fitted them a Countrey that produces good &s;tore of Wine. They love the &s;tronge&s;t Drinks be&s;t; for which rea&s;on, at their Fea&s;ts both men and Women drink more <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> than Wine. The women never eat in publick with their Husbands; but when the man has invited his Friends, the next day the Woman invites her She-companions. And it is ob&s;er|vable that at the Womens Fe&s;tivals there is more Wine and <HI>Aquavitae</HI> drank than at the mens. The Gue&s;t is no &s;ooner enter'd into the Dining-room, but he is pre&s;ent|ed with 2 or 3 Di&s;hes of Sweet-meats, and a Gla&s;s of half a pint of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> to excite his Appetite. They are great Feeders upon Onions and Herbs, which they eat raw out of the Garden. The <HI>Georgians</HI> are al&s;o great Travellers, and very much addi|cted to Trade; they are very dext'rous in &s;hooting with Bow and Arrows, and are accounted the be&s;t Souldiers in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> They compo&s;e a great part of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Cavalry, who keeps them in his Court at peculiar pay, and relies very much upon their fidelity and courage. There are &s;everal al&s;o in the Service of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> The Men are very well complexion'd and very well &s;hap'd; and for the Women, they are accounted the faire&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of all <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and therefore out of this Country it is that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> choo&s;es all his Wives, being not permitted to marry a Stranger. <HI>Teflis,</HI> where the Women have more liberty than in any part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Georgia,</HI> well &s;ituated, large and well built, where there likewi&s;e is a great Trade in Silk.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A RELATION of the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Mengrelia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MEngrelia</HI> extends from a Chain of Mountains, that &s;eparates it from <HI>Geor|gia</HI> to the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and is now divided into three Provinces (every one of which has their King.) The fir&s;t is call'd the Province of <HI>Imaret&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk,</HI> the king whereof pretends to a &s;uperiority over both the other, which is the rea&s;on they are often at War, and that with &s;o much cruelty, that when they have tak'n any Pri&s;oners of either &s;ide, they &s;ell them into <HI>Turky.</HI> They are &s;o accu&s;tom'd to &s;ell one another in this Country, that if a man or his wife have any occa&s;ion for money, they will go and &s;ell one of their Children, and many times they will exchange a Child for Ribands or other Toyes at the Mer|cers Shops.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Province is that of <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> and the King of this Province is call'd the King of <HI>Dadian.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the Province of <HI>Guriel,</HI> the King of which Province is call'd the King of <HI>Guriel.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Mengrelia</HI> was formerly &s;ubject to the King of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk,</HI> who &s;ent thither a Governor, which is call'd in their language <HI>Dadian.</HI></P>
<P>One of tho&s;e Governours being a per&s;on of wit and courage, gain'd &s;o far upon the affection of the People, that they cho&s;e him for their King.</P>
<P>The chief of the Province of <HI>Guriel,</HI> &s;eeing how the <HI>Dadian</HI> had obtain'd the King|dom, following the Example of <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> &s;hook off the Yoke of the King of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk,</HI> and cho&s;e another King among them&s;elves, who keeps his Soveraignty to this day, by the &s;upport of the <HI>Grand-Signor.</HI> For when the <HI>Dadian</HI> rebell'd he entr'd into an Alliance with the <HI>Grand-Signor,</HI> and oblig'd him&s;elf to furni&s;h him every year with &s;uch a certain quantity of Iron, upon condition that if the King of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk</HI> &s;hould war upon him, he &s;hould furni&s;h him with twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e. Of which the <HI>Turk</HI> was very glad, finding thereby the Country of <HI>Mengrelia</HI> divided, which being united, was able at any time to have di&s;turb'd him with an Army of fifty thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk</HI> coyns money of the &s;ame bigne&s;s and weight with that of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But in regard it is not &s;o fine metal as that of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he would have much ado to make it pa&s;s in the trade between his Subjects and the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which is very great, had he not found an expedient by putting the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s name upon the Coyn as well as his own, which makes it pa&s;s without any diffi|culty. He would al&s;o put the <HI>Grand-Signor</HI>'s Name upon his Coyn, but that the <HI>Turk</HI> coyns none but &s;mall money, or <HI>A&s;pers,</HI> excepting only &s;ome Ducats which he coyns at <HI>Cairo.</HI> The King of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk,</HI> as well as the King of <HI>Teflis</HI> coyns all &s;orts of forreign money.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Kings of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a-Shiouk, Mengrelia</HI> and <HI>Guriel,</HI> are Chri&s;tians al&s;o. And when they go to war, all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons attend them; Arch-bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Monks: not &s;o much as to fight as to encourage the Souldiers.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the fir&s;t time I travell'd into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> I &s;aw there an Emba&s;&s;a|dor from the King of <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> who&s;e behaviour gave all the <HI>Franks</HI> occa&s;ion of laugh|ter. The pre&s;ent which he made the <HI>Grand-Signor</HI> was in Iron and Steel, and a great number of Slaves. The fir&s;t time of his Audience, he had a train of above 200 Per&s;ons. But every day he &s;old two or three to defray his expences; So that at his departure, he had none but his Secretary and two Va&s;&s;als more left. He was a man of pre&s;ence but no wit: and every time he went to vi&s;it the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier,</HI> he pre&s;um'd to wear the white Bonnet which all the <HI>Franks</HI> wonder'd at; when they &s;aw that the <HI>Grand-Vi&s;ier</HI> wink'd at it. For &s;hould any other Chri&s;tian have done &s;o, he had been mo&s;t certain|ly put to death, or con&s;train'd to turn <HI>Mahumetan.</HI> By which it was apparent how much the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> valu'd the Friend&s;hip of the King of <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> and how care|ful he is of offending tho&s;e that are &s;ent from his Court. He knew tho&s;e People &s;uf|fer no affronts, but upon the lea&s;t word pre&s;ently draw; be&s;ides that there is nothing to be got by provoking them.</P>
<P>This Emba&s;&s;adour going once upon a vi&s;it into the Country, returning home was
<PB N="126" REF="78">
&s;urpriz'd with a Storm, whereupon he pull'd off his Boots and carri'd them under his Coat, choo&s;ing rather to go bare-foot to his lodging, then to &s;poil his Boots.</P>
<P>Another time, it being the cu&s;tom of all Catholick Amba&s;&s;adors to go to Ma&s;s to the Covent of Grey Friars in <HI>Pera,</HI> upon St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s day, the <HI>Mengrdia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Amba&s;|&s;ador after Ma&s;s was done, coming out of the Church, and &s;eeing &s;everal baubles which the Pedlers expo&s;e in the Cloy&s;ter upon that day, bought a Tin Ring, two or three &s;mall Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, and a Pipe, which he put in his mouth and went piping all the way i'th Street, as Children do coming from Fairs.</P>
<P>But to return to the matter, you mu&s;t take notice that there are not only Iron Mines, but al&s;o Mines of Gold and Silver in two places five or &s;ix days Journey from <HI>Teflis,</HI> the one call'd <HI>So&uuml;anet,</HI> the other <HI>Obetet.</HI> But the mi&s;chief is, the people can hardly be got to work there, for fear the Earth &s;hould tumble down, and bury them in the Mine, as it has many times happen'd.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Mine of Gold near to a place which is call'd <HI>Hardm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;h&eacute;,</HI> and a Mine of Silver at <HI>Guni&s;h&eacute;-Kon&eacute;.</HI> five days Journey from <HI>Erzerom,</HI> and as many from <HI>Trebi&s;ond.</HI></P>
<P>As for the people them&s;elves both&punc;<HI>Georgians</HI> and <HI>Mengrelians,</HI> they never trouble them&s;elves about the ignorance and viciou&s;ne&s;s of their Prie&s;ts, or whether they be able to in&s;truct them or no. The riche&s;t among them are they which are in mo&s;t credit, and ab&s;olutely give Laws to the poor. There are al&s;o &s;ome heads of the Church, that a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a juri&s;diction over the people, as to &s;ell them both to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and they choo&s;e out the hand&s;om'&s;t Children, both Boys and Girls, to get the more money, by which authority al&s;o the great men of the Country enjoy Marry'd Women and Maids at their plea&s;ure. They will choo&s;e out their Children for the Bi&s;hops while they are yet in their Cradles; and if the Prince be di&s;&s;atisfi'd at it, all the Clergy joyns with him that makes the choice, and then together by the Ears they go. In which Skirmi&s;hes they will carry away whole Villages, and &s;ell all the poor people to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> And indeed the cu&s;tom of &s;elling men and women is &s;o common in that Country, that a man may almo&s;t affirm it to be one of their chiefe&s;t Trades.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops di&s;&s;olve Marriages when they plea&s;e, and then Marry again after they have &s;old the fir&s;t. If any of the Natives be not Marri'd to his fancy, he takes another for &s;uch a time as he thinks fit, for which he pays her all&punc; the while as the <HI>Turks</HI> do. Very few of the&s;e people know what Bapti&s;m means. Only two or three days after the woman is brought to Bed, the Prie&s;t comes and brings a little Oyl, mumbles over a few Prayers, and then anoints the Mother and the Infant, which they believe to be the be&s;t Bapti&s;m in the World. In &s;hort, they are a people of no Devotion at all, neither in their Ceremonies nor in their Prayers. But there are great &s;tore of Nunneries, where the young Maids apply them&s;elves to their Studies, and after &s;uch an age, whether they &s;tay in the Nunneries or betake them&s;elves&punc;to the Service of any of the great Lords, they Confe&s;s, Baptize, Marry, and perform all other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Functions, which I never knew practis'd in any other part of the World be&s;ide.</P>

<P><HI>COmania</HI> is bounded toward the Ea&s;t by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; We&s;tward by the Mountains that divide it from <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia;</HI> Northward it lies upon <HI>Mu&s;covia;</HI> and Southward it is bounded by <HI>Georgia.</HI> From the Mountains that bound upon the North-Ea&s;t to <HI>Tercki,</HI> which is the River that parts <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> from <HI>Comania,</HI> it is all a level Country excellent for Tillage, and abound|ding in fair Meadows and Pa&s;turage. However it is not over-peopl'd, which is the rea&s;on they never Sow twice together in one place. The Climate is much the &s;ame
<PB N="127" REF="78">
as between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lion,</HI> where it Rains very much; and yet the Country people have cut &s;everal Channels from the Rivers to water the Grounds after they have Sow'd them, which they learnt from the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Tho&s;e Rivers fall from the Sou|thern Mountains, being not at all tak'n notice of in the Map. There is one among the re&s;t a very large River, which can be forded at no time. They call it <HI>Coya&s;ou,</HI> or <HI>The thick water,</HI> in regard it is continually muddy, the &s;tream being &s;o &s;low, that they can hardly di&s;cern which way it runs. It falls gently into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea to the South of the mouth of <HI>Volga.</HI> Not far from this River, in the months of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> all along the Shore of the &s;ame Sea, you may &s;ee va&s;t &s;hoals of fi&s;h about two foot long. Before, they have two legs, like a Dog's legs, behind in|&s;tead of legs they have only claws. Fle&s;h they have none, but only fat with a bone in the middle. Now in regard they are but &s;low pac'd, when they come upon Land the Country people ea&s;ily knock them on the head, and make Oyl of them; which is the greate&s;t Trade they have.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Comania,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Comouchs,</HI> dwell for the mo&s;t part at the foot of the Mountains, becau&s;e of the Springs &s;o plentiful in tho&s;e places, that in &s;ome Villages you &s;hall have above twenty or thirty. Three of the&s;e Springs meeting to|gether, make a &s;tream &s;trong enough to drive a Mill. But this is not the &s;ole rea&s;on, for there is Water enough in the plain. But in regard they are a people that only live upon the &s;poil and plunder of their Enemies, and of one another, as they are in continual fear of being &s;et upon, they love to dwell near the refuge of the Moun|tains, whither they fly with their Cattle upon any occa&s;ion of danger. For all the people round about, as <HI>Georgians, Mengrelians, Cirka&s;&s;ians, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> live altogether by rapine, and continual In-roads into one anothers Countries.</P>
<P>There are another &s;ort of people which are call'd <HI>Kalmouchs,</HI> that inhabit upon the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea between the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and the <HI>Tartars.</HI> The men are &s;trong, but the mo&s;t deformed under Heaven. Their faces are &s;o flat and broad, that there is the breadth of five fingers between each Eye. Their Eyes are very &s;mall, and that little No&s;e they have is &s;o flat, that there is nothing to be &s;een but two little holes in&s;tead of No&s;trils. Their Knees al&s;o and their&punc; Feet turn inward. When they go to the Wars, they carry their Wives and their Daughters, if they be twelve years of age, along with them, who fight as couragiou&s;ly as the men them&s;elves. Their Arms are Bows, Arrows, and Skains, with a great wooden Mace at the Pummel of their Saddles; their Hor&s;es being the be&s;t in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Their Captain is of &s;ome ancient Family, but they more particularly choo&s;e him for his valour. The Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covia</HI> &s;ends them pre&s;ents every year, to pre&s;erve their friend&s;hip, which pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;t in Cloth. And he grants them free pa&s;&s;age through his Territories, when ever they have a mind to invade the <HI>Mengrelians, Georgians,</HI> or <HI>Cirka&s;&s;ians,</HI> at which &s;port they are much more dextrous than the le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartars.</HI> Sometimes they advance into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as far as the Province of the <HI>&V;&s;bekes,</HI> which is a part of Great <HI>Tartary,</HI> ranging up as far as <HI>Caboul</HI> and <HI>Canda|bar.</HI> Their Religion is particular to them&s;elves, but they are great Enemies to the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Comouchs</HI> or people of <HI>Comania,</HI> they are <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and very pre|ci&s;e ones too. They are under the protection of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who makes great account of them, in regard they defend the Pa&s;&s;es into his Country on that &s;ide again&s;t the <HI>Kalmouchs.</HI> They are habited both men and women like the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartars,</HI> fetching all the Silk and Calicut which they u&s;e out of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for as for Cloth, they are contented with what they make in their own Country, which is very cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> is a plea&s;ant good Country, and full of variety. There are Plains, For|re&s;ts, Hills, and Mountains abounding in Springs, &s;ome of which are &s;o large, that &s;ome of them will &s;erve &s;even or eight of the neighbouring Villages. But on the other &s;ide, in all the Rivers that proceed from the&s;e Springs, there is not a fi&s;h to be &s;een. Flowers they have in abundance, e&s;pecially fair Tulips. There is a &s;ort of Strawberry al&s;o with a &s;hort &s;talk, of which five or &s;ix grow in a bunch; the lea&s;t are as big as a &s;mall Nut, of a pale yellow Colour. The Soil is &s;o fertile, that it brings forth without any great trouble a va&s;t plenty of all &s;orts of Fruits. Nor do the people need any other Gardens than their Fields which are cover'd with
<PB N="128" REF="79">
Cherry-trees, Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Walnut-trees, and all other u&s;eful Trees of the &s;ame nature: but their chiefe&s;t Wealth con&s;i&s;ts in Cattel, but e&s;pecially in well-&s;hap'd Hor&s;es, not much unlike the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gennets. They have al&s;o an abun|dance of Goats and Sheep&punc; who&s;e Wool is as good as that of <HI>Spain;</HI> which the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> fetch away to make Felts. They neither &s;ow Wheat nor Oats, but only Barley for their Hor&s;es, and Millet to make Bread; nor do they ever &s;ow twice in the &s;ame place: not but that the Land is good enough to bear Wheat, but becau&s;e they love Bread made of Millet better. They have very good Fowl, and Veni&s;on, and Wild-Fowl more than they know what to do withal; which they never hunt with Dogs, nor fly their Hawks at; for their Hor&s;es are &s;o &s;wift and &s;o good, that they will tire the Bea&s;t, and force him to lye down and yield. Ev'ry Hor&s;e-man has a Rope with a &s;liding-knot ready at the Pummel of his Saddle, which they are &s;o dextrous to throw about the neck of the Bea&s;t that begins to be weary, that 'tis twenty to one if they mi&s;s him. When they have kill'd a Deer, they cut off the legs, and breaking the Bones, eat the Marrow, which they &s;ay is the be&s;t thing in the World to &s;trengthen the Body. When they go to &s;teal Cattel, they carry along with them great Cows-horns &s;tuft with boyl'd Tripes cut in &s;mall pieces; then watch|ing their times when the Herd&s;men are a&s;leep, when the Dogs begin to bark, they throw to ev'ry one a Horn, with which the Dog pre&s;ently runs away: and &s;o while the Shepherds are a&s;leep, and the Dog is bu&s;ie to get the Meat out of the Horn, which is there ramm'd in on purpo&s;e, the Thieves drive away what they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Drink of the <HI>Sherkes</HI> is Water and <HI>Bo&s;a. Bo&s;a</HI> is a Drink made of Millet as intoxicating as Wine, which they want in the Country.</P>
<P>The Men and the Women, Boys and Girls go habited all alike, and their Habit is a colour'd Robe of Fu&s;tian, with a kind of large Petticoat underneath; with this they wear a little pink'd Wa&s;tcoat that reaches down to their Thighs; and over that a Ca&s;&s;ock of cour&s;e Cloth that reaches down to their Knees, girt about their Wa&s;ts with a Cord. The Sleeves of the Ca&s;&s;ock are op'n below and above, and &s;ometimes they pin them behind their Backs. They wear no Beards 'till they are &s;ixty years of age. And as for their Hair, neither Men nor Women, Boys nor Girls, ever wear it longer than the tips of their Ears. The Men, both young and old, &s;have the middle of their Heads about the bredth of two Fingers from the Forehead down to the Nape of the Neck: and then in &s;tead of Hats or Head-clothes, both Men and Women wear only a little Bonnet of the &s;ame Cloth as the Ca&s;&s;ock, made like a Night-cap. 'Tis true, when the Maids come to be marry'd there is &s;ome di&s;tinction upon their Heads; for then they fa&s;t'n to the hinder part of their Heads a round piece of Felt, which they cover with a white Veil very artificially pleated. Their Breeches are ty'd below their Knees, and reach to their Ancles; their Shooes, which are of Cordovan, both upper and under Leather, have but one &s;eam upon upper part of the Foot, being light, and cut like a pair of Pumps.</P>
<P>As for their Beds, they take &s;everal Sheep-skins and &s;ow them together, and then &s;tuffing them full of Millet-leaves, make a kind of Quilt. Now when they beat the Millet, the Leaf comes to be as &s;mall as the Chaff of Oats; &s;o that when the per&s;on ri&s;es off from the Quilt, the Quilt ri&s;es and &s;wells again of it &s;elf. Their Cu&s;hions are of the &s;ame Make, only &s;ometimes they are &s;tuft with Wool.</P>
<P>The People are neither Chri&s;tians nor <HI>Mahometans,</HI> all their Religion con&s;i&s;ting in &s;ome Ceremonies which they perform with the greate&s;t Solemnities which they can imagin: for at that time old and young of all Ages and Sexes, and all the whole Town mu&s;t be there at the place appointed, unle&s;s impotency or &s;ickne&s;s excu&s;es them. I call them Villages, for in all the&s;e Countries there is neither Fortre&s;s nor City, and as for their Villages, they are all built after the &s;ame Model, round, with a <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle, according to the Figure,</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ceremonies and Cu&s;toms of the People of <HI>Comania</HI> and <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Principal of all the Fea&s;ts which the <HI>Comouchs</HI> and <HI>Sherkes</HI> or <HI>Cirka&s;&s;i|ans</HI> make, is that which they make at the end of Autumn, after this manner. Three of the anciente&s;t of the Village are appointed to ma|nage it, and to di&s;charge them&s;elves of a Duty impos'd upon them in the company of all the people. The&s;e three old men take a Sheep or a Goat, and having mutter'd certain Prayers over the Bea&s;t, they cut the throat of it: after they have dre&s;t it very clean, they boil it whole, all but the Gathers, and them they roa&s;t&punc; The Sheep being boil'd, they &s;et it upon a Table, and carry it into a large Barn, where the People are appointed to meet: There the three old men &s;tand upright before a Table, and all the People, Men, Women and Children behind them. When the Table upon which the Meat &s;tands, is brought in, two of the three old men cut off the Legs and the roa&s;ted Gathers, and hold them up above their heads, and the third holds up a great Cup of <HI>Bo&s;a</HI> in the &s;ame manner, to the end the people behind may &s;ee them. When the people &s;ee the Meat and <HI>Bo&s;a</HI> &s;o lifted up, they pro&s;trate them&s;elves upon the ground, and &s;o continue till all the re&s;t of the Meat be &s;et up|on the le&s;&s;er Table, and that the old men have &s;aid &s;ome few words. Then the two old men that held up the Meat, cut off two little pieces, and give each of them a piece to him that holds the Cup, which being done, they take each of them a piece for them&s;elves. When they have all three eaten of the meat, the old man that holds the Cup, drinks fir&s;t, then gives the two old men to drink, fir&s;t to him upon the right hand, next to him upon the left, never letting go the Cup all the while. This fir&s;t Ceremony being thus accompli&s;h'd, the two old men turn toward the A&s;&s;embly, and go and pre&s;ent both of the Meat and the Drink, fir&s;t to their Chief or Lord, then to all the people, who equally eat their &s;hare, both men and women. That which remains of the four feet, is carry'd back to the Table, and the three old men eat it. This done, they go and place them&s;elves at the Table, where the Mutton is &s;et, where the olde&s;t of the three taking the Head, eats a little Mor&s;el; after him, the &s;econd, and next to him, the third does the fame. Then the fir&s;t old man commands the re&s;t to be carry'd to the Lord, who receives it with a great deal of re&s;pect, and after he has giv'n it to his next a-kin, or the Friend whom he loves be&s;t, the Head is gi'vn from one to another, till it be eat'n up. This being done, the three old men begin to eat of the Mutton a bit or two, and the Lord of the Village is call'd, who comes with his Bonnet in his hand, in a trembling po&s;ture; to whom, one of the old men pre&s;enting a Knife, he cuts off a piece of Mutton, and eats; and having drank a Cup of <HI>Bo&s;a,</HI> he returns to his Seat. After him, all the people, according to their turns in quality, do as much; and then, for the Bones the Children go to|gether by the ears among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They have another Fea&s;t before they begin to Mow their Meadows; at which time all the people of the Village, that have wherewithal, take every one a Goat, (for in their Ceremonies they e&s;teem Goats better than Sheep) and for the poor, they join eight or ten together for a Goat. Let them be Goats, Sheep or Lambs, when they are all brought together, they cut their Throats and then flea off the skin, leaving the four feet and the Head in it. Then they &s;tretch the Skin with &s;ticks that cro&s;s from one foot to the other, and &s;et it upon a Pole fix'd in the Earth, the top whereof enters into the head of the Bea&s;t, as is to be &s;een in the Figure of the Village; and as many Bea&s;ts as there are kill'd, &s;o many Poles are planted in the mid&s;t of the Vil|lage, with every one a particular Skin upon it; to which, every one that pa&s;&s;es by, makes a profound obey&s;ance.</P>
<P>Ev'ry one having boil'd his Goat, brings it into the void place in the middle of the Village, and &s;ets it upon a great Table with the re&s;t. There is the Lord of the Village with his Servants, and &s;ometimes the Lord of &s;ome other Village is invited. Now all this Victuals being upon the Table, three of the olde&s;t men of the Village
<PB N="130" REF="81">
&s;it down and eat a Bit or two: Then they call the Lord of the Town, and if there be any other Lord, they come both together, with &s;ome other of the Seniors of the Pari&s;h; who being &s;et down, eat up one of the Bea&s;ts, which the old men had &s;et apart for them; the re&s;t is divided among the people, &s;itting upon the ground.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Villages where you &s;hall have fifty Goats and Sheep, or Lambs and Kids, kill'd together at one time. As for their <HI>Bo&s;a,</HI> there are &s;ome that bring above 200 Pints; others more or le&s;s, according to their quality. All the day long they eat and drink, and &s;ing and dance to their Flutes a dozen together, which are in &s;ome mea&s;ure harmonious, as con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal parts, and decrea&s;ing propor|tionably from the Treble to the Ba&s;e. When the old men have &s;olac'd them&s;elves with eating and drinking, they go home, and leave the young people, Men and Wo|men, Boys and Girls to be merry by them&s;elves: They &s;tay as long as there is any Drink; and the next day they go early to Mowing.</P>
<P>They have other Ceremonies particular only to their Families. Once a year in every Hou&s;e they make a Cro&s;s after the Form of a Mallet, about five Foot high, the two Sticks that compo&s;e the Cro&s;s, being as big as a man's Arm. This the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e &s;ets in the Evening near the Door in his Chamber, and calling all his Family together, gives them every one a lighted Wax-Candle. Then fir&s;t he fixes his own to the Cro&s;s, next his Wife &s;ticks hers, and &s;o all the Children and Servants: If the Children be &s;o young, that they cannot do it them&s;elves, the Father and Mo|ther do it for them. If one of the Candles burn out before it be put out, 'tis a Pro|gno&s;tick that he or &s;he that fix'd it there, &s;hall not live out their year. If the Can|dle falls, then he who&s;e Candle it was, &s;hall be robb'd, or be forc't to fly for his Life.</P>
<P>If it thunders, all the people run out of the Village, and the young people of both Sexes let them&s;elves to &s;inging and dancing in the pre&s;ence of their Elders: And if any one be Thunder-&s;truck, they bury that per&s;on honourably, believing him to be a Saint. Be&s;ides that, they &s;end over all the Country for a white Goat, which they breed up and keep in the Village where it happen'd to thunder, having it in great veneration, till thundring in another place, the people &s;end for it thither al&s;o. If the Thunder fall upon any of their Hou&s;es, though it kill neither Man, Woman, Child, nor Bea&s;t, all that Family &s;hall be kept upon the publick &s;tock all that year, without being ty'd to any Labour but of Singing and Dancing. The&s;e people, during that time, go from Village to Village Dancing and Singing at peoples Doors, but never going into their Hou&s;es; for which the Inhabitants are bound to bring them out &s;omething to eat.</P>
<P>There is a day in the Spring, when all that have been &s;truck'n with Thunder, meet together in the Village where the white Goat is kept; who has always a Chee&s;e hang|ing about his Neck as big as a <HI>Parma</HI>&punc;Chee&s;e. This Goat they take and carry to the Village of the chief Lord of the Countrey. They never go in, but the Lord with all the re&s;t of the Village coming out, they all together pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the Goat. Having &s;aid &s;ome Prayers, they take away his Chee&s;e, and immediately put another in its place. The Chee&s;e which was taken away, is at the &s;ame time cut into little pieces, and di&s;tributed among the people. After that, they give the Strangers to eat, and be&s;tow their Alms upon them; &s;o that by this wandring from Village to Village, they get good &s;tore of Money.</P>
<P>They have among them but only one Book; and it is as big as one of our large&s;t <HI>Eolio</HI>'s, and it lies in the hands of an old man, who has only the priviledge to touch it. When that old man is dead, they choo&s;e another old man to keep the Book; who&s;e Duty it is to go from Village to Village, where he hears of any &s;ick people. He carries the Book with him, and after he has lighted up a Wax-Candle, and put the people out of the Room, he lays the Book upon the Stomach of the &s;ick per&s;on, opens it, and reads in it, then blows over it &s;ev'ral times, &s;o that the Breath pa&s;&s;es toward the mouth of the Party: Then he cau&s;es the party di&s;eas'd to ki&s;s the Book &s;everal times, and as often lays it upon his head, which is a Ceremony of half an hour. VVhen the old man goes away, one gives him a Beef or a Heifer; another gives him a Goat; every one according to their Quality and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o Old Women that take upon them to cure the Sick. The&s;e women feel the body of the &s;ick party, all over, but more particularly they handle and grope that part where the di&s;temper lies: during which time they let go &s;everal belches out
<PB N="131" REF="81">
of their mouths, and the more &s;ick the party is, the louder and thicker, they fetch their belches. The &s;tanders by hearing them belch in that manner and fetch &s;uch vilanous &s;ighs from their &s;tomacks, believe their friend to be dangerou&s;ly ill, and that the louder the Women belch, the more ea&s;e and comfort they receive; but whether they do or no, the women are well pay'd for their pains. VVhen any one feels a pain in the Head, they &s;end for the Barber, who, gives two cutts upon the Head acro&s;s with the ra&s;or, and then pours Oyl into the wound. For they believe the Head-ach proceeds only from a wind between the fle&s;h and the bone, for which the Inci&s;ion opens a pa&s;&s;age to let it out.</P>
<P>At their Funerals they that are the near Relations or Friends of the dead, &s;ome cut their faces, and other parts of their Bodies with &s;harp flints, others pro&s;trate them|&s;elves upon the ground, and tear their hair; &s;o that when they return from the Burial, they are all of a gore blood: However, notwith&s;tanding all this affliction, they never pray for the Dead.</P>
<P>As to their Marriages: VVhen a young man has &s;een a Virgin which he has a lik|ing to, he &s;ends one of his friends to agree with her Parents or her Tutor, what he will give for her. Commonly the guift con&s;i&s;ts in Hor&s;es, Cows or &s;ome other &s;ort of Cattel. VVhen the agreement is made, the Parents and Kindred of the party there|by contracted, together with the Lord of the place, go to the Hou&s;e where the Virgin lives and bring her to the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e, where there is a Fea&s;t ready prepar'd; and after they have made merry, and &s;ung, and danc'd for a while, the Bridegroom and Bride go and lye together, without any other Ceremony. If the man and Maid are of two Pari&s;hes, the Lord of the Village where the Man lives accom|pany him and his Kindred to the next Village all together, to fetch the Bride from thence.</P>
<P>If a Man and the wife have no Children, he is permitted to take &s;everal wives one after another till he have I&s;&s;ue. If a marri'd woman have a Gallant, and that the Husband &s;hould come and find his wife abed with him, he goes away again without &s;aying a word, and never takes any further notice of it. The woman al&s;o in the &s;ame ca&s;e, does the like by the man. Nay, the more Gallants a woman has, the more &s;he is re&s;pected: And it is a common cu&s;tom when they fall out, to taunt one another, that if they were not ugly, or ill natur'd, or di&s;eas'd, they would have more Admi|rers than they have. The People are of an excellent Complexion, e&s;pecially the wo|men, who are extreamly fair, and finely &s;hap'd, and keep their beauty till five and forty or fifty years. They are very laborious, and work them&s;elves in the Iron Mines, which they melt afterwards and forge into &s;everal Tools and Implements. They make abundance of Embroidery of Gold and Silver for their Saddles, their Quivers, and their Pumps, as al&s;o upon the Calicut of which they make their Handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>If the man and the woman happen to quarrel often together, &s;o that they cannot be reconcil'd: the Husband complaining fir&s;t to the Lord of the Place, He &s;ends for the Woman, and having giv'n order to &s;ell her, gives the Man another. But if the Woman complain fir&s;t, the Man is &s;erv'd the &s;ame &s;awce. If a man or Woman be a di&s;turber of their Neighbours, if the Neighbours complain to the Lord, he pre&s;ently cau&s;es the party to be apprehended and &s;old to the merchants that buy Slaves, for they are re&s;olv'd they will live in quiet.</P>
<P>They that take upon them the quality of Gentlemen, fit &s;till, do nothing and &s;peak very little. In an evening they ride out, and meet &s;ome twenty or thirty together to go a &s;tealing. Nor do they rob only their Enemies, but their Neighbours, from whom the chief prey which they take are Cattle and Slaves. All the Country-people are Slaves to the Lord of the Village where they live, whom he imploys to till his Land, and cut wood for him upon occa&s;ion, of which they &s;pend va&s;t quantities. For not being very warm clad, they keep fire all night in the places where they &s;leep.</P>

<P>THE le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartars</HI> have a very ancient race of Hor&s;es, which they breed up even to Super&s;tition; &s;o that it would be among them an act of Sacriledge to &s;ell them to &s;trangers, as being not a little curious how they &s;ell them to one another. The&s;e are the Hor&s;es which they ride, fifty or &s;ixty in a Troop together when they go a thieving; and &s;ometimes a hunder'd together, when they de&s;ign any Incur&s;ion upon their Enemies. When the old Men come to be infirm and impotent, if they know any &s;tout young Man that is a Souldier, they will lend him one of their Hor&s;es (if he have none of his own) to make an Incur&s;ion, upon condition to have half of the Booty. Many times they run up as far as <HI>Hungary,</HI> near to <HI>Comora</HI> and <HI>Javarin.</HI> The&s;e Hor&s;es, partly by nature, partly by early cu&s;tom, will travel four or five days together with a handful of Gra&s;s giv'n them once in eight or ten hours, and a little Water every four and twenty hours. But they never go a robbing with them 'till they come to be &s;even or eight years old: be&s;ides that, they mu&s;t undergo a very &s;evere education ere they make u&s;e of them in tho&s;e hard&s;hips. Their Bit is only a piece of Iron with a Buckle on each &s;ide, to which they fa&s;t'n the Bridle and Head-&s;tall. For eight days together they put under the Saddle a bag of Gravel or Earth. The fir&s;t day the Sack is a Hor&s;e-man's weight; and &s;o they add to it every day, 'till it come to be double the weight at the end of the eight days. As they increa&s;e every day the weight upon the Hor&s;es back, they abate every day the Hor&s;e's Provender and Drink. During the&s;e eight days, they get up and walk the Hor&s;e two or three Leagues. The next eight days, they abate every day of the weight, 'till the Sack be quite empty. Proportionably al&s;o they abate him of his Meat and Drink as in the fir&s;t eight days, and every day take up the Girt a hole &s;horter. The three or four la&s;t days they afford the Hor&s;e neither Proven|der nor Drink, according as they find him able to endure hunger and thir&s;t, and the labour which he is to undergo. The la&s;t day, they work him 'till he be all over of a Sweat; then they unbridle and un&s;addle him, and pour upon him the colde&s;t Water they can meet with. That done, they lead him into a field, and tye him by the leg with a Cord, at &s;uch a length as they intend he &s;hall feed; yet &s;till from day to day allowing him more Rope, 'till at la&s;t they let him loo&s;e, and feed with the re&s;t of the Hor&s;es. This terrible fa&s;ting and labour, during which time, that little which they do eat and drink, they eat and drink with the Bit in their mouth, brings them to be &s;o lean and out of fle&s;h, that their very bones are ready to &s;tart out of their skins: So that if any one &s;hould &s;ee them in that mi&s;erable condition, that does not know the nature of the Hor&s;es, would think they would never be fit for good &s;ervice. The hoofs of the&s;e Hor&s;es are &s;o hard that they never &s;hoe them, and yet they will leave the prints of their feet in the Earth, or upon the Ice, as if they had been &s;hod. The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> are &s;o curious in having Hor&s;es that will endure labour, that &s;o &s;oon as they &s;ee any hand&s;om Colt in their Breed, they pre&s;ently take him up, to &s;chool him as I have related: but hardly ten in fifty endure the tutoring.</P>
<P>As for their Diet, 'tis a great advantage for the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> to ride a Mare, in regard they Drink the Milk. They that ride Hor&s;es, carry along with them a little Bag full of pieces of Chee&s;e dry'd in the Sun; they have al&s;o a &s;mall <HI>Boracho</HI> of Goat-skin, which they fill with Water where they meet with it, into which they put two or three bits of their hard Chee&s;e, which &s;oftens with the motion of the Hor&s;e, the <HI>Boracho</HI> being ty'd under his Belly: and thus the Water becomes a kind of &s;owr Milk, which is their ordinary Drink.</P>
<P>As for their In&s;truments of Cookery, every Hor&s;e-man has a large wooden Ladle hanging at the Pummel of his Saddle, out of which the rider drinks him&s;elf, and gives his Hor&s;e likewi&s;e to drink. They that encounter them, can hope for no better Booty
<PB N="133" REF="82">
than their Hor&s;es; but they are very hard to be tak'n; for when one of the&s;e Hor&s;es perceives that his Rider is &s;lain, he follows tho&s;e that fly with all the &s;wiftne&s;s ima|ginable. Be&s;ide that, tho&s;e Hor&s;es being carri'd into other Countries, are pre&s;ently &s;poil'd, and come to nothing.</P>
<P>Their Cloathing is only a Sheep-skin, which in Winter they wear with the wool next their Bodies; in the Summer turning the other &s;ide. They that are the Nobi|lity of the Countrey, wear Wolves-skins, with a kind of Shirt, and Breeches of cour&s;e Fu&s;tian of divers Colours, which the Taylor gets little credit by &s;ha|ping.</P>
<P>Their Women are very white and well proportion'd, but their Faces are broad, and their Eyes little, &s;o that by thirty years of Age they become very deformed. There is not a man but has two or three Wives, which they never choo&s;e but out of their own Tribe. Every Tribe has a Chief; who is one of the Nobility of the Countrey, and carries for his Banner a Hor&s;e-tail fa&s;ten'd to a half-Pike, and dy'd into the Co|lour belonging to the Tribe. When they march, every one knows where to place him&s;elf, and how much ground they ought to take up for their Tribe and their Cattel; one Tribe never encroaching upon another.</P>
<P>The Women and Maids are generally clad in a large Shirt that reaches down to their feet. Upon their Heads they wear a large white Vale, their Foreheads being bound about with a large black Handkerchief ty'd in five or &s;ix Rolls. The Noble &s;ort of Women and Maids wear over this Vail a Bonnet open behind, which comes down upon their Foreheads like a three-corner'd Cap: One of the&s;e Points &s;tands up in the mid&s;t of the Forehead, lin'd with Velvet, Satin, or Cloth of Gold, and &s;et with &s;mall pieces of Gold and Silver, and fal&s;e Pearls, of which they al&s;o make them&s;elves Bracelets: Their Breeches are of &s;ingle-colour'd Cloth, and for Shoes and Stockings, they only wear a Cordovan Boot of what Colour they plea&s;e, neatly &s;ew'd.</P>
<P>When a young man intends to marry, it behoves him to give the Father and the Mother of the Maid a certain quantity of Hor&s;es, Bullocks or Cows, or other Cat|tel, which is done in the pre&s;ence of the greate&s;t part of the anciente&s;t of the Tribe, and a <HI>Moullah</HI> be&s;ide. When the Agreement is made, the young man has the liber|ty to &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s, but not till then: For before, he has only the information of her Mother, his Si&s;ters, or &s;uch Women as were his own Friends. Be&s;ides the three Wives which the man is allow'd to take, he may keep &s;everal female Slaves; but the Children are &s;till &s;laves, and can never inherit. The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> are of a ve|ry hot con&s;titution, though not &s;o hot as the women. Both the one and the other are very fair-hair'd; but the men have little or no Beards: So that if there be any one that has more Beard than ordinary, and can but write and read, they make him a <HI>Moullah.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e people have no Hou&s;es, but live in Tents, or in Waggons which are drawn after them where-ever they go. The Tents are for the old people and little Chil|dren, with their Slaves that attend them. The young women ride in Waggons clos'd up with Boards, and to let in the Air, upon one &s;ide they open a Window that is made like a Lattice. In the Evening they are permitted to &s;pend a little time in the Tents. When the Girls have attain'd to the age of ten or twelve Years, they never &s;tir any more out of their Waggons till they are married, not &s;o much as for the nece&s;&s;ities of Nature; but in the middle of the Waggon there is a Plank to be taken up; and if it be in a place where they &s;tay, a Slave pre&s;ently comes and clean&s;es all underneath. The Maidens Waggon is ea&s;ie to be known, as being painted with Flowers; and generally there is a Camel ty'd to the Tail of it be&s;mear'd with &s;everal colours, and &s;everal No&s;egays or Po&s;ies of Flowers &s;tuck about the Head of the Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>The young men have al&s;o every one their Charlot, wherein they only carry a <HI>Bo|racho</HI> of Hor&s;e-skin, containing about 38 Quarts, which they u&s;uall filly with Mares-milk, which is very &s;owr. They have al&s;o every one another Waggon next to that wherein they ride them&s;elves; wherein they carry &s;everal <HI>Boracho</HI>'s full of Cows-milk, which is very &s;owr. At Meals they drink this Milk: But before they powr it out, they &s;tir it in the <HI>Boracho</HI> with a great Stick, that the Curd may mix with the thin Milk. But the Mares-Milk is only for the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, though before they drink of either, they mix it with water. When a Friend comes to &s;ee
<PB N="134" REF="83">
them, they fetch out their dri'd Chee&s;e, which they call <HI>Kourout,</HI> and breaking it into little Bits, eat it with fre&s;h Butter. At their Fea&s;ts they &s;ometimes kill old Sheep, &s;ometimes old Goats. But for their Hor&s;es they never kill them but at the Funerals of their Kindred, at the Birth of a Child, or at their Marriage-Fea&s;ts, or la&s;tly, when their Friends return laden with Spoil from any incur&s;ion, and are &s;tor'd with Slaves. They never drink any thing but Mares-Milk or Cows-Milk, and when they can get neither, they will endure thir&s;t for three or four days together before they will drink water, being always grip'd with a terrible Colick when they drink it. They never eat any Salt, being of an opinion that it is naught for the Eyes. They live long, and are very &s;trong, and &s;eldom &s;ick; nor do they refu&s;e any Diet but Swines-fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Their Countrey is very level; only for &s;ome few Hills in &s;ome places. They have great &s;tore of Pa&s;ture-grounds, and every Tribe has their peculiar Wells to water their Cattle. In the Winter they lodge upon the banks of great Rivers, near to Woods and Mari&s;hes, &s;uffering their Herds to feed at liberty. When the Snow is very deep, the Cattel &s;crape it away with their feet to come at the Gra&s;s, though they meet with very little el&s;e but Reeds and Bu&s;hes. In the mean while the men cut down the Woods, make great Fires, and employ them&s;elves in Fi&s;hing. There are &s;ome parts of the&s;e Rivers where the lea&s;t Fi&s;h they take is about four or five foot long; and &s;ome there are above ten or twelve foot in length. Some they dry in the wind, and pre&s;erve again&s;t Summer; &s;ome they &s;moke in holes which they make in the Earth: As for the &s;maller &s;ort, they boil them, and eat them without Salt or any other &s;ea&s;oning. When they have eat'n their Fi&s;h, they &s;coop up a large wooden Ladel full of the Fi&s;h-water and gulp it down. As for Bread, there is no talk of it in their Countrey.</P>
<P>When they are not at Wars, or are but newly return'd from any Incur&s;ion, they &s;pend their time in Hunting, but cannot endure any other Hounds except Greyhounds: So that he mu&s;t be a very poor <HI>Tartar</HI> indeed that do's not keep a Greyhound. Take notice however by the by, that the&s;e petty <HI>Tartars,</HI> concerning whom I have la&s;t di&s;cours'd, are certain people adjoyning to <HI>Comania,</HI> which the <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Mengrelians</HI> call <HI>Noga&iuml;es;</HI> who may be well reckon'd among the number of the petty <HI>Tartars,</HI> in regard they are all under one Prince, whom the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> appoints King over all Petty <HI>Tartary,</HI> and who receives his inve&s;titure at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> are all <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> Nor have they any Phy&s;ician among them; making u&s;e only of certain Simples of which they have a traditional knowledge. When the &s;ik per&s;on lies in any extremity, they &s;end for a <HI>Moullah,</HI> who comes with the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which he opens and &s;huts three times, &s;aying certain Prayers, and lay|ing it upon the &s;ick per&s;on's face. If by chance the &s;ick per&s;on recover, they at|tribute his recovery to the Sanctity of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and pre&s;ent the <HI>Moullah</HI> with a Sheep or a Goat: If he die, all his Kindred meet and carry him to the Grave with great Te&s;timonies of Sadne&s;s, crying continually <HI>Alla, Alla.</HI> When he is interr'd, the <HI>Moullah</HI> mutters certain Prayers ov'r the Grave, and is paid for his pains accord|ing to the wealth of the Heirs. For the poor he generally &s;pends three days and three nights in that exerci&s;e; for the rich he as u&s;ually &s;pends a Month, never &s;tirring all the while from the Grave; and &s;ometimes &s;ev'n or eight.</P>
<P>When any one of them is wounded, they u&s;e no other Salve but only boil'd Fle&s;h, which they apply hot to the wound. If the wound be deep, they thru&s;t in a piece of Fat as hot as the wound can endure it; and if the per&s;on be able to kill a Hor&s;e, the wound is cur'd &s;o much the &s;ooner; for the Fle&s;h and Fat of a Hor&s;e are much more medicinable than the Fle&s;h of any other Creature.</P>
<P>Were it not the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tartars</HI> to buy their Wives when they marry, there would be fewer Whores. But in regard there are an abundance of poor young men that have not wherewithal to buy Wives, they never marry at all. This is that which makes &s;o many Souldiers among them, and emboldens 'em to invade their Neigh|bors, and to get &s;omething whereby they may be enabl'd to buy them a Wife. For the Virgins they are nev'r to be defil'd, being always &s;hut up in their waggons: But for the women they are oft'n debauch'd, appointing their private Meetings, when they go to fetch water for their Cattel, when their Husbands are a hunting, or look|ing after their Herds. Nor is it a hard thing to conceal it from their Husbands, in regard the <HI>Tartars</HI> are not in the lea&s;t prone to Jealou&s;ie.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="83">
By the way take notice, that the <HI>Noga&iuml;es,</HI> though they live almo&s;t after the &s;ame man|ner as the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and are under the &s;ame Prince, yet they perfectly hate them; reproaching them for effeminate, becau&s;e they live in Hou&s;es and Villages, whereas the true Souldier &s;hould live in Tents as they do, to be ready upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>They that run a-foot, as well in the&s;e Countries, as in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> when they are wea|ry, take Walnuts and brui&s;e them, and then rub the Soles of their feet with them before the fire as hot as they can endure it, which pre&s;ently makes them fre&s;h again.</P>

<P><HI>PERSIA,</HI> according to the pre&s;ent State of the Empire, to the North is bounded by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; Southward, by the Ocean; Ea&s;tward it joyns to the Territories of the Great <HI>Mogul;</HI> We&s;tward, to the Dominions of the Grand <HI>Signor;</HI> the two Empires being parted by the Rivers <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>But that you may the better under&s;tand the full extent of the Dominions of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King you are to know, That this great Monarch, be&s;ides that Tract of Ground which is properly call'd <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a va&s;t part of the ancient <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> and the great <HI>Armenia,</HI> the ancient Kingdoms of the <HI>Parthians</HI> and <HI>Medes,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Lar,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Ormus,</HI> and all Ea&s;tward of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> beyond <HI>Can|dahar,</HI> almo&s;t as far as the Kingdom of <HI>Scindi.</HI></P>

The Province of <HI>Guilan</HI> is included in the Province of <HI>Mazandran;</HI> and the Air is &s;o unwhol&s;om, that the People cry of him that is &s;ent to command there; <HI>Has he robb'd, &s;tol'n, or mur|ther'd, that the King &s;ends him to</HI> Guilan?</P>
<P>At <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which is almo&s;t in the middle of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there are &s;ix months of hot, and &s;ix months of cold weather. The Snow falls three or four times in a &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ometimes &s;o very thick, that there is hardly any travelling upon the Road. About a League from the City, toward the Mountain, there &s;tands a Stone about two or three Foot high, which when the Snow hap'ns to cover, progno&s;ticates a plentiful Year; and the fir&s;t Country-man that carries the news thereof to the King, receives a hundred <HI>Tomans.</HI> As for Rain, there is very little falls there, unle&s;s it be in <HI>April,</HI> and then it &s;ometimes rains very hard.</P>
<P>In the Southern Provinces, the heats are very exce&s;&s;ive, and kill abundance of our <HI>Europeans,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are giv'n to drink.</P>
<P>All <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is water'd with little Rivers; but there is not one navigable River through the whole extent of it, unle&s;s it be <HI>Aras,</HI> or the <HI>Araxes</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which carries &s;ome few flat-bottom Boats. The other Rivers, in&s;tead of growing bigger, the farther they keep their cour&s;e from the Springs, grow &s;hallower for want of Water, by rea&s;on of the infinite number of <HI>Krei&s;es</HI> or Channels, which they cut out of the Rivers to water the Lands, which would not bring forth &s;o much as only Gra&s;s without the help of tho&s;e Cuts; unle&s;s it be in the Province of <HI>Mazandran,</HI> which from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>March</HI> &s;eems a kind of Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e, through the plea&s;ing variety of Herbs and Fruits. However, <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in general being thus water'd is a mo&s;t fruitful Country: though it be true, that many of their Springs and Chan|nels are lo&s;t and brok'n. And <HI>Mirza-Ibrahim</HI> Governour of the Province of <HI>Edzer|baijan</HI> told me one day, that in the very Territory of <HI>Tauris,</HI> there were above two hundred Springs utterly lo&s;t, either by accident or negligence.</P>
<P>As for their Gardens, they water them with Well-water, by the help of a Wheel and an Ox; but the running Water is much better, as not being &s;o cold, and more fatning to the Earth. And therefore the Fruits that grow in the Mountains which are only water'd by the Rain or by the Dews, are much better ta&s;ted, and keep longer.</P>
<P><HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is a mountainous Country, but for the mo&s;t part the Mountains are very dry and barren. As for Woods, there are none in all the Country. Travellers are al&s;o forc'd to go a great way out of their Road to find a Spring; and &s;ometimes they &s;hall ride ten or twelve Leagues, before they meet with any Water but what they carry in their Bottles. There are &s;ome Mountains out of which they dig Salt, as Stones out of a Quarrey. There are al&s;o Plains where the Sand is nothing but Salt, though it be not &s;o &s;avoury as our Northern Salt.</P>
<P>Of late &s;everal Copper-Mines have been found out, of which the Natives make all &s;orts of Kitchin-Hou&s;hold&s;tuff. Their Lead comes from <HI>Kerman;</HI> their Iron and Steel from <HI>Cora&s;an</HI> and <HI>Kasbin,</HI> though not &s;o good as that of <HI>Spain.</HI> Their Steel is very fine, with a &s;mooth grain, and grows very hard in the Water, but it is as brittle as Gla&s;s. Neither will this &s;ort of Steel agree with the Fire: &s;o that if the Fire have not more than a double heat when the Steel is forg'd, it will look ju&s;t like a piece of burnt Charcoal. The Steel which we call <HI>Damas-Steel</HI> comes from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call it <HI>Gauherder.</HI></P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome Mines of Gold and Silver in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> wherein it appears that they have anciently wrought. <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> al&s;o try'd again, but found his expence to be more than his profit: whence it is become a Proverb in <HI>Per&s;ia, Nokre Kerven dehkrarge nohha&s;&s;el;</HI> The Silver-Mine of <HI>Kerven,</HI> where they &s;pend ten to get nine, which is the rea&s;on that all the Gold and Silver of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> comes out of Forein Countries.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Flowers and Fruits of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> of Turquoi&s;es and Pearls.</HEAD>
<P>THE Flowers of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are nothing comparable to our <HI>European</HI> Flowers, neither for variety nor beauty. For having pa&s;s'd the <HI>Tigris</HI> in the Road to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> you meet with nothing but Ro&s;es and Lillies, and &s;ome other Fruits peculiar to the Country.</P>
<P>As for Ro&s;es, they have great &s;tore, which they di&s;til, as they do Orange-flowers, and tran&s;port the Waters into all the Ea&s;tern parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>I never left the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but &s;ome of the Lords, e&s;pecially four of the white Eunuchs, beg'd of me to bring them &s;ome Flowers out of <HI>France;</HI> for they have every one a Garden before their Chamber-door: and happy is he that can pre&s;ent the King with a Po&s;ie of Flowers in a Cry&s;tal Flower-Pot.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Apples, Pears, Oranges, Granates, Prunes, Cherries, Apricots, Quinces, Che&s;nuts, Medlers, and other &s;orts of Fruit, which is not generally &s;o well-ta&s;ted as ours.</P>
<P>Their Apricots indeed, e&s;pecially the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, are better than ours. When you open this Apricot, the Stone cleaves in two, and then the Kernel, which is only a &s;mall Skin, as white as Snow, is more plea&s;ing to the ta&s;t than if it had been pre|&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>As for their Melons, they are mo&s;t excellent, and very plentiful, neither is it &s;o dangerous to eat them to exce&s;s, as ours. There have been &s;ome that have eat'n &s;ix and thirty pound in a day, and have never been the wor&s;e. There is a prodigious quantity of them &s;old in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where they are brought to Market, from midnight 'till four a Clock in the afternoon. Tho&s;e Melons which are fir&s;t in &s;ea&s;on, and are call'd <HI>Guermez,</HI> are in&s;ipid, and ta&s;t of nothing but Water. However the Phy&s;icians advi&s;e you to eat them, &s;aying that they plump up the Fle&s;h, and renew the habit of the Body. The next to the <HI>Guermez,</HI> are better than they, and they in|crea&s;e in goodne&s;s 'till they come to be quite out of &s;ea&s;on; the la&s;t of which they keep all the Winter long.</P>
<P>Though they have &s;uch va&s;t plenty, yet they never leave but one Melon upon a &s;talk, and when it is as big as a Nut, the Gard'ner, or his Wife, or his Children, lye down upon the ground and lick off the Down, which they &s;ay keeps the Melon from being &s;weet, and rip'ning kindly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have al&s;o a particular &s;ort of Quince-Pipin, but not &s;o good as ours, which they fry unpar'd, ca&s;ting great &s;tore of Salt in the Pan to excite thir&s;t, and then pre&s;ent them to their Friends at their Collations. They have al&s;o Almonds and Figs, but few Small-nuts or Wall nuts.</P>
<P>Oyl they have none, but in the Provinces of <HI>Mazandran</HI> and <HI>Guilan,</HI> which furni&s;h all the re&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but the Olives are rotten, black, gravelly, and not worth any thing, compar'd with <HI>Province</HI>-Olives.</P>
<P><HI>Armenia, Mengrelia, Georgia,</HI> and <HI>Media</HI> abound in Vineyards. They bury their Vines all the Winter, and take them up again in the Spring by rea&s;on of the cold. In the hotter Countries they dre&s;s their Vines as we do, without any under-propping them. There are three &s;orts of Wines in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That of <HI>Ye&s;d</HI> is very delicate; that of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> but ordinary: that of <HI>Ye&s;d</HI> is tran&s;ported to <HI>Lar</HI> where there lives a great number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who care not to live but where they may have good Wine, and that at a cheap rate. It is al&s;o carry'd to <HI>Ormus,</HI> where it is &s;old half in half cheaper than the Wine of <HI>Schiras.</HI> As for the Wine of <HI>Schiras,</HI> it is made of one only Grape, &s;weet in ta&s;t, but which heats the Mouth extremely. This &s;ort of Grape is call'd <HI>Kichmi&s;h&eacute;;</HI> it is a white Grape, without any &s;tone, as vulgarly believ'd; but however it has a &s;tone, though it be hardly to be perceiv'd, which neverthele&s;s will appear in new Wine, when it frets like a little Ligament. They &s;ay that the Wine of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is cold upon the Stomach, but that it fumes into the Head. For its coldne&s;s upon the Stomach I can &s;ay little, but I know it will warm the Head, if a man takes too much of it. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they never keep their Wine in Tuns, but in
<PB N="145" REF="88">
great earthen Ve&s;&s;els bak'd in an Oven, either glazed, or el&s;e &s;mear'd over with the fat of a Sheeps rump, &s;topp'd up with wood'n Covers, cover'd over again with a great piece of red Calicut, that lyes over all the lids of the Pots.</P>
<P>The King and his Lords have other &s;orts of Cellars for magnificence, where they treat &s;uch as they invite. The&s;e are four &s;quare Rooms not above three or four &s;teps deep, with a Well in the middle, the floor being &s;pread with <HI>Turky</HI> Carpets. Now at the four corners of the Well &s;tand four great Bottles containing twenty Pints apiece, the one of White, the other of Claret. Between the great Bottles &s;tands a row of le&s;&s;er Bottles filled, a Bottle of White, and a Bottle of Red. In the Cellar-wall are &s;everal niches one above another, and in every nich a Bottle, &s;till vary'd <HI>Gules</HI> and <HI>Argent;</HI> a very plea&s;ant &s;ight to good Companions in a Room, which is as light as day.</P>
<P>As for Herbs and Roots they have very good in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but above all, mo&s;t excellent <HI>Roman</HI> Lettuce. But there is no &s;ort of Pul&s;e, nor can they find a way to make Pea&s;e grow among them. The <HI>Carmelites</HI> carry'd A&s;paragus, Artichoaks, and Succory, which were never &s;een there before, but now begin to thrive very well.</P>
<P>As for Turquoi&s;es and Pearls I &s;hall &s;peak thereof in my di&s;cour&s;e of Jewels, toward the end of my <HI>Indian</HI> Travels.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bea&s;ts of Service; of the Fi&s;h and Fowl of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Bea&s;ts for &s;ervice in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> are Hor&s;es, Mules, A&s;&s;es, and Camels. The Hor&s;es of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are but of an ordinary &s;tature, le&s;s than ours, very narrow before, but very &s;wift and light. They carry their heads very ill in running, by rea&s;on of the Cu&s;tom to which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e them. For they have got a trick of managing their Hor&s;es, yet never getting upon their backs; they teach them to Amble by tying their feet with two Cords of an equal length, to the middle whereof are fa&s;ten'd two other Cords that are fa&s;ten'd to the Saddle, which &punc;two Cords keep their feet &s;o, that they cannot &s;tir but at &s;uch a di&s;tance; and &s;o they deal with their Mules upon which the old men generally covet to ride. The Hor&s;es of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are very docible, and ea&s;ily brought up. They give them nothing el&s;e from one Evening to another but a Sack full of chopt Straw, with a mea&s;ure of Barley which they mingle together with the Straw, to the end they may eat both together. When the Barley is newly ear'd, they give it them for fourteen or twenty days together to purge their Bodies, as we for the &s;ame end put our Hor&s;es to Gra&s;s in the Spring. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hor&s;es hold out very well 'till eighteen or twenty years of age; but they never cut their Stone-Hor&s;es in that Coun|try. In the Winter, they never take off their Shooes, but only Fro&s;t-nail them. Their Furniture is very light and hand&s;omly made. And this is further ob&s;erv'd, that whereas we keep Goats in our Stables and Inns, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> keep Hogs.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of A&s;&s;es in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Tho&s;e that are bred in the Country only &s;erve to carry burthens; but there are a &s;ort of <HI>Arabian</HI> A&s;&s;es that are &s;wift and very hand&s;om, excelling in price the common &s;ort of Hor&s;es. The Merchants of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> keep the&s;e A&s;&s;es in their Country Hou&s;es, taking it for a great piece of Grandeur to Ride every Morning to their Shops.</P>
<P>Some parts of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are perplex'd al&s;o with wild-Bea&s;ts, as Lyons, Bears, and Leopards, but there are but very few; nor have we heard that ever they did any great mi&s;chief. Porcupines they have al&s;o; and I my &s;elf &s;aw brought before the King two men, the one of which was Shot through the Thigh, and through the Leg with a Porcupine's Quill. The &s;econd was kill'd, the Porcupine having darted his Quill a little above his right Pap through his Bre&s;t. As for their Fi&s;h, there are an abundance of Carps, Trouts, and Pikes in the River <HI>Aras:</HI> but in all the other Rivers of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> there is but one &s;ort of Fi&s;h, which is a kind of
<PB N="146" REF="89">
Barbel. In the &s;ubterranean Channel which they bring to water their fields there is another &s;ort of Fi&s;h very plentiful of bones, and as little as can be eaten.</P>
<P>Where the white Mulberies grow by the River &s;ide, &s;o &s;oon as they begin to bear fruit, 'tis very good pa&s;time to &s;ee the Crabs, as big as the Palm of a man's hand, come out of the River after Sun-&s;et, and climb the trees to eat the fruit, and then by break of day return into the River again. They are delicate food, far beyond Crey|fi&s;h, but a hot provocative Diet, as the Phy&s;icians well ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>During the Fro&s;t they bring from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea great &s;tore of Salmon or Salmon-Trouts, four or five Foot long. The Province of <HI>Media</HI> is well &s;tor'd with Sturgeon from the mouth of the River <HI>Araxes.</HI> In the &s;ame Sea there is a certain Fi&s;h like a Carp, which they &s;alt and dry like our Herrings. From the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf comes nothing but Salt-fi&s;h, which is tran&s;ported over all the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Their Fowls are much the &s;ame that we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> only I do not remember that I ever &s;aw any Quails in the Country. As for their Pigeons, they fly wild about the Country; but only &s;ome which they keep tame in the City, wherewithal to decoy the re&s;t: which is a &s;port the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e in hot weather as well as in cold. Now in regard the Chri&s;tians are not permitted to keep the&s;e Pigeons, &s;ome of the vulgar &s;ort will turn <HI>Mahometans</HI> to have that liberty. There are above three thou&s;and Pigeon-hou&s;es in <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> For every man may build a Pigeon-hou&s;e upon his own Farm, which yet is very rarely done; all the other Pigeon-hou&s;es belong to the King, who draws a greater Revenue from the Dung than from the Pigeons: which Dung, as they prepare it, &s;erves to &s;moak their Melons.</P>
<P>Poultrey is very plentiful in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and the <HI>Armenians</HI> brought out of <HI>Europe</HI> the way how to Fat Capons; the fir&s;t &s;o fatted they pre&s;ented to the King, who lik'd them &s;o well, that he order'd that the riche&s;t of the <HI>Armenians</HI> &s;hould be commanded to provide him &s;uch a number every year. There are no Turkeys in all <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> but the <HI>Armenians</HI> trafficking to <HI>Venice</HI> carry'd &s;ome from thence, which when the King had ta&s;ted, he lik'd &s;o well, that he order'd the <HI>Armenians</HI> to breed him up &s;uch a number, and to &s;tock the Kingdom with them. But the <HI>Armenians,</HI> &s;eeing the King would impo&s;e a new Tribute of Turkeys as well as Capons, grew negligent, and &s;uffer'd the Chickens to dye as &s;oon as they were hatch'd. Thereupon the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;u&s;pecting the fraud, commanded the <HI>Armenians</HI> to keep the dead Turkeys, that they might be Judges how they came by their deaths: And it was my wonder to &s;ee &s;o many young Turkeys hanging again&s;t the Walls of &s;ome Hou&s;es in <HI>Zulpha,</HI> that occa&s;ion'd this Story to be told me.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of Water-fowl are as plentiful in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as with us.</P>
<P>Upon the Frontiers of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Armenia,</HI> at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year are to be &s;een a great number of Birds, much like to our Owzils. Much about the &s;ame time the Corn begins to appear, but then is the ground cover'd with &s;uch infinite &s;warms of Locu&s;ts, that the <HI>Armenians</HI> are forc'd to betake them&s;elves to their Proce&s;&s;ions, and to water the ground with a Water which they fetch a great way off, whereinto the Bodies of &s;everal martyr'd Chri&s;tians were thrown. Three days the&s;e Pro|ce&s;&s;ions and waterings of the ground continue, and after that, whether it be that the fore-mention'd Birds do eat the Locu&s;ts, or only drive them away, in two or three days the Country is clear of them.</P>
<P>As for Birds of prey, the Country wants none, Falcons, Sparrow&punc; Hawks, Lane|rets, &amp;c. of which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is very well provided, having above eight hundred belonging to his Game. Some of the&s;e Birds are taught to fly at the wild Boar, or wild A&s;s, or wild Goat; others at Cranes, Herons, wild Gee&s;e, and Par|tridg. The chiefe&s;t of which Birds are brought from the Southern Mountains extending from <HI>Schiras</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf.</P>
<P>The King takes great delight to hunt the Boar and Hart; and if it come to pa&s;s that the Game out-run the Dogs, then they let fly one of their Hawks, who pre|&s;ently &s;eizes the head, and while &s;he is continually pecking and di&s;turbing the Bea&s;t, the Dogs are pre&s;ently at his heels. The Hawks are taught to &s;top like a Hor&s;e at full &s;peed: el&s;e they would never quit their prey, which they pre&s;ently do, as &s;oon as ever the Falconer &s;hews them their reward. Now their way of ord'ring or making the Hawk is this. They take the skin of a Hart, head, body, and legs, and &s;tuff it with Straw, to the end it may be like the Bea&s;t which they intend to repre&s;ent in the nature of a Quarry. When they have &s;et it in the place
<PB N="147" REF="89">
where they u&s;ually train up the Hawk, they lay meat upon the head, or in the holes of the eyes, to the end the Bird may be &s;ure to &s;eize tho&s;e parts at his down|come. Being accu&s;tom'd to feed in this manner for &s;ome days together, they fix the Bea&s;t upon a Plank with four Wheels, and cau&s;e it to be drawn with long Cords by certain men, that mend their pace ev'ry day, 'till at length it is drawn by a Hor&s;e at full &s;peed, whereby the Bird is accu&s;tom'd by degrees not to for&s;ake her prey. After the &s;ame manner they counterfeit all other &s;orts of Quarrys to enter their Hawks, as well wild Boars, wild A&s;&s;es, as Hares and Foxes. Some there are that will order a Crow with the &s;ame indu&s;try as you would make a Hawk. They have al&s;o a certain Bea&s;t which they call <HI>Once,</HI> which has a &s;potted skin like a Tiger, but which is neverthele&s;s very gentle and tame; this a Hor&s;e-man will carry behind him, and when he &s;ees a wild Goat, he &s;ets down the <HI>Once,</HI> which is &s;o nimble, that in three leaps he will be upon the back of the wild Goat; though the wild Goat be a very &s;wift Creature. The <HI>Once</HI> immediately &s;trangles him with his &s;harp teeth. But if by accident the wild Goat get from him, the <HI>Once</HI> will &s;tand &s;till in the &s;ame place aba&s;h'd and troubl'd, &s;o that an Infant may take him and kill him, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance made in his own defence.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> take great delight in Hunting, and in that &s;port it is that they love to &s;hew them&s;elves magnificent: In&s;omuch that <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> de&s;irous to treat all the Amba&s;&s;adors then at his Court, which at that time were the <HI>Tartarian, Mu&s;covite,</HI> and <HI>Indian,</HI> carry'd them along with him into the field, and having tak'n a great number of Harts, Fallow dear, Hinds, and wild Boars, he caus'd them all to be made ready to be eat'n the &s;ame day; And while he was fea&s;ting, an Architect had order to rai&s;e a Pyramid of the heads of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts in the middle of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> of which there are &s;ome remains to this day. When the Architect had rais'd it to a con&s;iderable height, he came very plea&s;antly to the King, and told him he wanted nothing but one head of &s;ome great Bea&s;t to fini&s;h the Work. The King, whether in his Wine, or to &s;hew the Amba&s;&s;adors how ab&s;olute he was over his Subjects, turning briskly toward the Architect; <HI>Thou &s;ay'&s;t well,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>nor do I know where to meet with a Head more proper than thy own.</HI> Thereupon the mi&s;erable Architect was forc'd to &s;ubmit his own Head, the King's Command being pre&s;ently put in execution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the manner of Building in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN regard there is little Wood or Stone in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> all the Cities, except &s;ome Hou&s;es, are generally built of Earth; but of an earthen, or rather a kind of Potter's Clay, &s;o well wrought, that you may cut it like Turf, being wrought to a ju&s;t con&s;i&s;tency. The Walls are made with lays of Earth, according to the proportion intended, and between every lay of Earth, three Foot high, two or three rows of Bricks bak'd in the Sun. The&s;e Bricks are made in a &s;quare Mold three fingers thick, and &s;even or eight inches broad: and for fear they &s;hould cleave with drying in the Sun, they lay over them pounded Straw to keep them from chopping in the heat. They never lay the &s;econd lay 'till the fir&s;t be dry, nor is the &s;econd lay to be &s;o broad as the lowermo&s;t. Tho&s;e Buildings which are made of Brick bak'd in the Sun are very hand&s;om; and after the Wall is rais'd, the Ma&s;on plai&s;ters it over with a Morter made of Potter's Clay mingled with Straw; &s;o that the defects of the Building being cover'd, the Wall appears very firm and clo&s;e. Then the Work-man plai&s;ters the Morter over again with a Lime mixt with <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>-Green, which he pounds with a certain Gum, to render the Lime more glutinous: and then rubbing the Wall over with a cour&s;e Bru&s;h, it becomes as it were damask'd and &s;ilver'd, and looks like Marble. The poor are contented with only bare Walls, or &s;ome cour&s;e daubing that co&s;ts little. The middle of the Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of a large <HI>Portico,</HI> twenty or thirty Foot &s;quare; and in the middle of the <HI>Portico</HI> a Fountain full of Water. It is all open upon one &s;ide; and from the <HI>Portico</HI> to the Pond or
<PB N="148" REF="90" MS="y">
Fountain all cover'd with Carpets. At every corner of the <HI>Portico</HI> is a Room to &s;it and take the fre&s;h Air; and behind another large Room, the floor whereof is &s;pread with Carpets, Mattre&s;&s;es, and Cu&s;hions, according to the quality of the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e. Upon the two &s;ides of the <HI>Portico</HI> are two other Chambers, and doors to go from one Chamber to another: and thus are the Hou&s;es of the great Lords built, but only they are more &s;pacious. For their Hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of four great Parlours, that look toward the four corners of the World, and every Parlour has two Chambers upon each &s;ide, which make eight Chambers, that &s;urround a great Hall in the middle. The King's Palace is al&s;o built after the &s;ame fa&s;hion: and generally the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Hou&s;es are very low, it being a rare thing to &s;ee one three Stories high. Yet all their Chambers and Rooms are arch'd, wherein the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> exceeds us. For with|out all that trouble and time that we &s;pend, they will pre&s;ently rai&s;e an Arch &s;o broad and high as ea&s;ily demon&s;trates the skill of the Work man. The tops of their Hou&s;es are flat and terra&s;s'd; being pla&s;ter'd with Earth mixt with Straw chopt very &s;mall, and well temper'd; which they bind together with a layer of Lime beat'n for &s;even days together, which makes it as hard as Marble, and if they want Lime, they pave the Terra&s;s with &s;quare Tiles bak'd in an Oven, &s;o that the Rain can do no harm. But they are very careful to &s;hovel off the Snow, for fear it crack the Terra&s;s with lying. Without the Hou&s;es &s;how nothing, but within they are curiou&s;ly painted with Birds and Flowers, wherein the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are no bad Arti&s;ts. They take great delight to have &s;everal little Chambers, with &s;everal Doors, and Lattice-windows, the quarrels whereof are of Gla&s;s of various colours. This &s;ort of glazing &s;erves generally, and indeed more properly, for the Apartment where the Women may come. For they might have Cry&s;tal-windows if they pleas'd, but they glaze the void &s;paces in this matter, that their Women may not be &s;een; after they have fram'd the op'n place that gives light, like a Flower-Pot with &s;everal Flowers in it, which the Gla&s;s of &s;everal colours imitates to the life; whereby it is impo&s;&s;ible that the Windows &s;hould be peer'd through; be&s;ides, that it is plea&s;ant to the Eye. The Doors of their Hou&s;es are of <HI>Tehinar</HI>-Wood, which is very noble, and their Wain&s;coting is as neat. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that love o&s;tentation, always di&s;play their rich Carpets, Mattre&s;&s;es, Cu&s;hions, Coverlets, and all the mo&s;t co&s;tly Furniture they have, in the fore part of their dwellings: For the <HI>Haram,</HI> or the Women's Quarter is but meanly adorn'd, in regard they are never vi&s;ited by any men but their Husbands. In &s;ome of their Rooms they have very narrow Chimnies; for the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;et all their Wood upright which they burn, becau&s;e of the Smoak; be&s;ides, they make but &s;mall Fires, in regard they have &s;o great a &s;carcity of Wood. When they would go to &s;leep, they lye down upon a Plank cover'd with a Carpet, and wrap them&s;elves in a quilted Blanket. In the Sum|mer they &s;leep in the open Air, upon their Terra&s;&s;es; and in regard the Women lye there too, there is an order obtain'd, that the <HI>Moullahs</HI> that &s;ing upon the <HI>Mo&s;quees</HI> &s;hall not pre&s;ume to go up in the morning, becau&s;e it might be their hap to &s;ee the Women as they lay; it being one of the highe&s;t pieces of infamy imaginable for a Woman to be di&s;cover'd with her Face op'n.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Hou&s;es that belong to great Lords, that have a &s;quare place before their Doors, where they that come to vi&s;it them may put their Hor&s;es, to the end the Street &s;hould not be pe&s;ter'd. If you look upon the Front of their Hou&s;es, there is little ornament to be &s;een, unle&s;s it be upon &s;ome which have been lately built.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A De&s;cription of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the chief City of the Kingdom and Do|minions of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ISpahan, Sphahan,</HI> or <HI>Sphaon,</HI> as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> pronounce it, which &s;ome Travellers have too unwarily affirm'd to be a fine City, lyes in the Province of <HI>Hierac,</HI> which compo&s;es &s;ome part of the ancient Kingdom of the <HI>Parthians.</HI> It is the Capital City of all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and a very large place, where the King u&s;ually keeps his Court. The Records of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> declare that formerly it was two contiguous Towns, one
<PB N="149" REF="90">
part whereof belong'd to <HI>Haider,</HI> and the other to <HI>Neamed-Olahi,</HI> two parts of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;till retaining tho&s;e two names, which has occa&s;ion'd great quarrels and de|bates among the people, while they have both been eager to prefer their own quarter. Nor indeed could <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> be accompted other than a Village, before <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> had conquer'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Ormus.</HI> But then ob&s;erving &s;o fair a Situa|tion, where he might as well be near the Provinces which he had newly conquer'd, as for the de&s;ign which he had to extend his Dominions to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, as he had enlarg'd them to the South, he quitted <HI>Ca&s;bin</HI> and <HI>Sultany</HI> to re&s;ide at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as in the center of his Empire.</P>
<P>This City is &s;eated in a va&s;t plain, which extends it &s;elf three ways fifteen or twenty Leagues. Upon the South about two Leagues from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> ri&s;es a very high Mountain, on the top whereof toward the We&s;t are to be &s;een the remains of a very &s;trong Fortre&s;s, where <HI>Darius</HI> kept him&s;elf, when <HI>Alexander</HI> gave Battle to him in that Plain. In the &s;ide of the Rock is a <HI>Grotto,</HI> either natural or artificial, or both, out of which i&s;&s;ues a natural Spring of excellent Water, where a <HI>Dervis</HI> u&s;ually inhabits.</P>
<P>The Circuit of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> taking the Suburbs all in, is not much le&s;s than that of <HI>Paris;</HI> but the number of Inhabitants is ten times greater at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rris</HI> than at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Nor is it a wonder that a City &s;hould be &s;o large and yet &s;o ill peopl'd, where every Family has its particular Hou&s;e, and every Hou&s;e its particular Garden. What ever way you come to it you may di&s;cover fir&s;t the Towers of the <HI>Mo&s;qu&eacute;es,</HI> and then the Trees that environ the Hou&s;es, &s;o that <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;eems rather a Forre&s;t than a City. The Plain being fertile is well inhabited, but there are no Villages in it, only three or four Hou&s;es in a place together.</P>
<P>The Walls of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> are of Earth, to which do belong &s;ome pittiful Towers without Battlements or Platforms, Ba&s;tions or Redoubts, or any other Fortifica|tion. The Moats al&s;o are as bad, neither broad nor deep, but always dry. In &s;ome places al&s;o the people have beaten down great gaps in the Wall, to get the neare&s;t way into the City; yet they reckon ten Gates, which are but of Earth however, and of no defence; the chief of which are <HI>Der-Va&s;al&s;ehab,</HI> not far from the King's Palace, <HI>Der-Tokshi, Der-Mark, Der-Va&s;al-Lembon, Der-Na&s;an-Abad, Der-Sha,</HI> and <HI>Der-Dekt.</HI> The Gates are made of Planks rudely joyn'd together, and cover'd with plates of Iron four fingers broad, and as thick as a Crown, fa&s;ten'd with flat-headed Nails. The Keys are never carry'd to the Go|vernour, but left with a &s;illy Porter that op'ns and &s;huts the Gates as he plea&s;es him&s;elf; for indeed there is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hutting the Gates when there are &s;o many other ways into the City.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is ill laid out; for the Streets are narrow and unequal, and for the mo&s;t part dark, becau&s;e of the Arches that go from one Hou&s;e to another, &s;o that a man is forc'd &s;ometimes to feel his way for two hundred paces. Moreover the Streets are many times annoy'd with Loads of Ordure and the Carca&s;&s;es of dead Bea&s;ts, which cau&s;e a mo&s;t filthy &s;tench, and would be very infectious certainly, but for the whole&s;omne&s;s of the Air. In the mo&s;t part of the Streets are Wells, which are &s;top'd up in Summer, and open'd in the Winter to carry away the Rain and the Snow into the Arch'd Channels which run under Ground through the middle of the Street. There are al&s;o before every Door certain Troughs to receive the filth and ordure of every Family, which the Country-men come and carry away to Dung their Grounds. Every morning the Country-man comes with his A&s;s to lade Dung; and it is ob&s;ervable that he is more diligent to carry away the Dung of the <HI>Armenians, Franks,</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> that drink Wine, than of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that drink none. And this is the profit of the Servants of the Hou&s;e that &s;ell an A&s;&s;es Load of Dung for five, and &s;ometimes for ten or twelve <HI>Kasbe&s;h&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as of all the re&s;t of the Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are not pav'd, which makes them very incommodious both Summer and Winter. For in Sum|mer the du&s;t puts out your Eyes, unle&s;s it be in the Streets where the great Mer|chants live, and about the <HI>Meydan,</HI> where there are people hir'd to water the Streets Morning, Noon, and Night. Tho&s;e people go about the Streets al&s;o with a <HI>Boracho</HI> full of Water, and a Gla&s;s, with Ice in a Bag, to give them drink that de&s;ire it: Nor do they take any money, being paid out of the Legacies left by per&s;ons decea&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. In the Winter this du&s;t turns to mire half
<PB N="150" REF="91">
the leg deep; though it be very true that there are very few people to be &s;een then in the Street; for in regard of the vaulted Channels that run through every Street, &s;hould the Soak'd Earth chance to fall under the Hor&s;e, it might endanger a Limb. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that they will hardly receive a man within their doors with a &s;pot of Dirt upon his Cloaths, for fear of being defil'd by him.</P>
<P>You &s;hall al&s;o meet with little Holes again&s;t the Walls of the Hou&s;es in the op'n Street, where the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are not a&s;ham'd to &s;quat and Pi&s;s in the face of all the World. If there be any running Water in the Street, they take a little in their Hands and wa&s;h their Member with it; or if there be no Water, they rub it again&s;t a Stone or the Wall, which they take for a great piece of gentility and mo|de&s;ty.</P>
<P>That which farther contributes to the na&s;tine&s;s of the Streets of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is, that the Butchers throw the Blood and Excrements of the Bea&s;ts which they kill into the Streets. If a Hor&s;e or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">le, a Camel or an A&s;s dye, they pre&s;ently throw him into the Street. True it is, that there are people who come pre&s;ently to buy it of the Owner; who make <HI>Hari&s;&s;&eacute;,</HI> which they &s;ell to the poor Work-men. This <HI>Hari&s;&s;&eacute;</HI> is thus prepar'd; they boyl the fle&s;h of the dead Bea&s;t with Corn, and after it is well boyl'd they ma&s;h it together, 'till it becomes like a Pottage. They al&s;o make <HI>Hari&s;&s;&eacute;</HI> of good Mutton; both which &s;orts they &s;ell in the Market-place, or great <HI>Meydan</HI> of the City.</P>
<P>Though the City of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> be dirty, yet there is a way for per&s;ons of Ability to avoid it; for they never &s;tir but on Hor&s;e-back, with two or three Lackeys, call'd <HI>Chatres,</HI> that run before to make room. For the Men are all upon the fal&s;e Gallop in the Streets, without any fear of hurting the Children: by rea&s;on that the Chil|dren are not &s;uffered to play in the Streets like ours, but as &s;oon as ever they come from School, they &s;it down by their Parents, to be in&s;tructed by them in their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Valets</HI> or Foot-men make a Trade of Running; of which the King and the Lords have &s;everal in their &s;ervice; it being a piece of grandeur to keep a great many. They &s;erve from Father to Son, undergoing an Apprenti&s;hip in Running. From &s;ix to &s;even years of age, they only &s;et them&s;elves to walk &s;lowly. The next year they run a League at a time upon a hand&s;om trot, the next year after they run two or three Leagues, and &s;o proportionably for the re&s;t. At eighteen years of age they are allow'd a Scrip of Flowr, with a flat piece of Copper to bake their Bread upon, and a Bottle of Water; all which they carry about them when they run. For the&s;e people when they are &s;ent Po&s;t never take the <HI>Caravan</HI>-Road but the &s;horte&s;t cuts through the De&s;erts, and mu&s;t therefore accu&s;tom them&s;elves to carry their Provi&s;ion. The King and the Lords have no <HI>Chatres,</HI> but what are Ma&s;ters; which degree they are not to arrive at without &s;ome Ceremony and performing a Race, like our <HI>Jemmy</HI> and the Butcher of <HI>Croyden.</HI></P>
<P>If he be a Lord that owns the <HI>Chater</HI> who de&s;ires to be a Ma&s;ter, he &s;ends for all his Friends, &s;ets up a Scaffold in the <HI>Meydan,</HI> provides a Collation, and &s;ends for the Curti&s;ans to divert the Company. Now there is not one of the&s;e Gue&s;ts that does no bring &s;omething to give this <HI>Chater</HI> after the Race is run, either a Bonnet or a Girdle, or &s;ome other thing, part of which the <HI>Chater</HI> gives to his fellows. Then the <HI>Chater</HI> appears with his Legs greas'd, his Thighs bare, only a &s;light &s;hort pair of loo&s;e Breeches, and a Girdle with three little bells hanging upon his Belly. Thus accouter'd he &s;tarts from <HI>Ali-Capi,</HI> and between Sun-ri&s;ing and Sun-&s;etting he runs backward and forward to a Stone a League and a half from the City toward the Mountains; running in that time &s;ix and thirty of our common Leagues, or a hundred and eight Miles. While he runs, there is <HI>Kourouk</HI> in the <HI>Meydan,</HI> and upon all the Road where he runs, and three or four Hor&s;e-men that continually ride to and fro, to &s;ee that there be no deceit in the <HI>Chater</HI>'s Race; who when he approaches near the City, ride before to give notice of his coming. Every time he &s;tarts and returns, the Drums and Trumpets &s;ound; at the end of the Race there &s;tand &s;everal per&s;ons with Arrows in their Hands, and ev'ry time he comes to the Stone they give him an Arrow, which he carries back every cour&s;e to <HI>Ali-Capri.</HI> Every time he returns, the Curti&s;ans rub him and make much of him. All the time he runs, he eats nothing, but drinks Sherbet now and then. If he acquit him&s;elf
<PB N="151" REF="91">
well, which appears by the number of Arrows brought back, he is admitted a Ma&s;ter by the approbation of the King's Foot-men, who are &s;uperior to all the re&s;t. The <HI>Kans</HI> or Governours of Provinces run their own <HI>Chaters</HI> with the &s;ame Ceremonies, and in the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e manner.</P>
<P>The Fortre&s;s of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is nothing at all con&s;iderable. It joyns to the Wall upon the South &s;ide of the City, and is twice as long as broad, but without any defence in the World, unle&s;s it be of &s;ome pitiful Towers made of Earth. Here it is that the King keeps all the Rarities which he has purchas'd, or that has been pre&s;ented to him. For as to his main Trea&s;ure, I believe it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in Gold-Plate. Within the Fortre&s;s there is a large Field, &s;ow'd every year with Rice and Corn; hard by which &s;tands the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Capuchin</HI>-Friars.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in general, unle&s;s it be the <HI>Meydan</HI> and &s;ome few arch'd Streets where the Merchants live, is more like a great Village than a City; the Hou&s;es &s;tanding at a di&s;tance one from the other, with every one a Garden, but ill look'd after, not having any thing in it perchance but only one pitiful Tree: true it is that they begin to build better of late days, but it is without the City. As for the Women, 'tis not a pin matter whether they live out of the City or within, in regard they never &s;tir out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oors, and as &s;eldom go a-f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oo.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meydan</HI> or great <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> was the contrivance of the great <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> who had never done it, if a great Prince of the ancient Race of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had not refus'd him the old <HI>Meydan,</HI> with &s;everal Priviledges, and the Hou&s;e that &s;tood by it. Thereupon he de&s;ign'd this new <HI>Piazza,</HI> to draw off the Merchants&punc; and to &s;poil the old Market-Place, by their departure from that quarter of the City which is le&s;s inhabited at this day. It is not far from this old <HI>Meydan,</HI> that the <HI>Au&s;tin-Friars</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the <HI>Carmelites</HI> on the other have their Habi|tations. There are al&s;o two &s;ides of that <HI>Meydan</HI> entire, under the <HI>Portico's,</HI> where &s;it only &s;uch People as &s;ell Herbs, Fruit, and Victuals; the other two &s;ides are almo&s;t faln to decay; but when it was all &s;tanding, it was as hand&s;om as the new one: and it is to be wonder'd, that the Prince, who built it, did not choo&s;e the place where <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> has built his, as being near the Water, and con&s;equently far more conve|nient.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Meydan</HI> then is a place about &s;even hundred Paces long, and between two and three hundred broad. It has Buildings upon all the four &s;ides; it lyes in length directly North and South; the Fronts are every one Portico'd, and Ter|ra&s;s'd at the top; and on the City-&s;ide are little Chambers nine or ten Foot high, which fall very&punc; much to decay, being only built of Brick bak'd in the Sun. They are inhabited, the greate&s;t part of them, by the mo&s;t infamous Curti&s;ans of the City. At &s;ome Paces di&s;tance from the <HI>Portico's,</HI> is a Channel which is pav'd with &s;tone, and runs round about the <HI>Piazza; Sha-Abas</HI> caus'd &s;everal Trees to be planted by the &s;ide of it, but both the Channel and the Trees being altogether neglected, are faln to decay; be&s;ides, that the &s;mell of the Water in the Summer time is very noy&s;om.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the <HI>Piazza</HI> &s;tands a kind of a May-Pole, or Ma&s;t of a Ship, where the People exerci&s;e &s;hooting at Birds. When the King comes to &s;hoot, they &s;et a Cup of Gold upon the top of the Ma&s;t, which he is to &s;trike down with an Arrow. To which purpo&s;e he mu&s;t ride full &s;peed, nor is he permitted to &s;hoot 'till after he has pa&s;t the May-Pole, turning him&s;elf upon the crupper of his Hor&s;e: a remain of the ancient cu&s;tom of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> that kill'd their Enemies flying.</P>
<P>The Cup belongs to him that &s;trikes it down; and I have &s;een <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> Grandfather of the pre&s;ent King, in five Cour&s;es &s;trike down three Cups.</P>
<P>From this Ma&s;t or May-Pole down to the great <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> they &s;ell nothing but Wood and Charcoal: from the &s;ame Pole to the Sun-Dial upon the North-&s;ide, are none but &s;uch as &s;ell old Iron-Tools, old Harne&s;s for Hor&s;es, old Coverlets, and other Brokery-ware, as in our <HI>Long-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>From the Pole to another <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> to the South, ju&s;t again the Sun-Dial, is the place for all the Poulterers. The re&s;t of the <HI>Piazza</HI> toward the Palace, is always kept clean, without any Shops, becau&s;e the King comes often abroad in the Evening to &s;ee Lions, Bears, Bulls, Rams, Cocks, and all other &s;ort of Creatures fight which are brought thither.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as in many other Cities, are divided into two parts, the
<PB N="152" REF="92">
one call'd <HI>Hedari,</HI> the other <HI>Nametla&iuml;;</HI> and upon all the Combats of Bea&s;ts before|mention'd, there are always very con&s;iderable Wagers laid between the&s;e two Tribes. The King, who is a neuter, gives to the Ma&s;ter of the Bea&s;t that gets the upper hand &s;ometimes five, &s;ometimes ten, &s;ometimes twenty <HI>Tomans,</HI> according to the value of the Wager laid; and he that wins the Wager, pre&s;ents the Ma&s;ter of the Bea&s;t likewi&s;e. They have al&s;o a Sport at breaking of Egg, by knocking the ends one again&s;t another, &s;ome of which Eggs come to three or four Crowns. The Hens that lay them are bred in a Country which they call <HI>Sau&s;evare,</HI> about a hun|dred leagues from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> toward the Province of <HI>Kara&s;an;</HI> the Cocks of which Country are bigger and &s;tronger than other Cocks, and co&s;t &s;ome of them a hundred Crowns. There are a &s;ort of Tumblers al&s;o, that after Dinner &s;et up their Stages in the <HI>Meydan,</HI> and toward the Evening, they that play the <HI>Maid-Marians</HI> come and en|compa&s;s a &s;quare place with a cour&s;e piece of Calicut; and then through another very fine Cloth, the Wenches &s;hew a thou&s;and tumbling Tricks and antick Po&s;tures. When they have done, they come and ask the Spectators for Money, who give them every one what they think fit. Every Friday, which is as it were Market-day, the Country-folks bring to Town what they have made in the Villages, as Doors and Windows fitted to be hung up, Window-frames, Locks, and other things of that nature. Upon that day al&s;o they &s;ell Mules, Hor&s;es, Camels, and A&s;&s;es, which brings a great confluence of people from all parts.</P>
<P>Upon the We&s;t-&s;ide, where &s;tands the Gate of the Palace, and <HI>Ali</HI>'s Gate, be|tween the Canal and the <HI>Portico's</HI> are rang'd &s;ome &s;eventy Pieces of Cannon upon their Carriages. The&s;e Guns, together with the Sun-Dial, were brought from <HI>Ormus</HI> by the Great <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> of which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ought to have had their &s;hare; for with|out their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he never could have tak'n the Town.</P>
<P>From the corner of that Front, which touches upon the Ea&s;tern Front of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> in the middle, are all Sadlers Shops; and from that <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> to another corner that touches upon the We&s;tern Front, live the Book-Sellers, Book-binders, and Trunk-makers. In the middle of the Southern Front &s;tands a Portal, with a Tower upon each &s;ide, which leads to a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> the Gate whereof is cover'd all over with Plates of Silver, and is certainly the neate&s;t Portal and faire&s;t Entrance into any <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>At the other end of the &s;ame Front, where it joyns to that upon the We&s;t, there is a great Portal that leads to a fal&s;e Gate of the King's Palace; near to which&punc; as &s;oon as you are enter'd&punc; you meet with the Apartment of the Great Trea&s;urer, who is a white Eunuch, and having the Keys of the Chamber where the Money lyes, takes care to pay what-ever the King orders him. Through that fal&s;e Gate all the King's Provi&s;ions are carry'd into the Palace. This way al&s;o enter they that are entertained for the Manufactory of the King's Ti&s;&s;ues, Silks, Sattins, Coverlets, and the like. In the &s;ame Enclo&s;ure al&s;o the <HI>Franks,</HI> who are under the King's Wages, and live at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> come every day to work; as al&s;o all the mo&s;t particular and eminent Arti&s;ts that the King hires.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern Front, which makes one of the two lengths of the <HI>Meydan,</HI> is thus appointed; from the Southern angle that touches the Trunk-maker's quarter, live all your Pedlers that &s;ell all the &s;mall Commodities of <HI>Norimberg</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>As for the King's Palace, I cannot make any hand&s;om de&s;cription of it, in regard there is nothing of Beauty either in the Building or in the Gardens. I think I have been as far in the Hou&s;e as a man could go, every time I was &s;ent for by His Maje&s;ty; but excepting only four Rooms which they call <HI>Divans,</HI> I &s;aw nothing but pitiful low Galleries, and &s;o narrow that hardly two men could pa&s;s a-bre&s;t in 'em. In one of tho&s;e Galleries I had audience of the King, in the Garment of Honour which he had be&s;tow'd upon me. But In regard I have &s;pok'n of two of them in another place, and that the other two are much alike both Building and Furniture, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of them here.</P>
<P>From the King's Palace Gate to <HI>Haly</HI>'s Gate live the Gold&s;miths, Lapidaries, and Gravers of Stones for Seals: <HI>Haly</HI>'s Gate is a plain Gate, naked of Work: of which I have already &s;pok'n.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Haly</HI>'s Gate, and the other angle of the &s;ame We&s;tern Front, &s;tands a great Gate which leads into a <HI>Bazar,</HI> where all the <HI>Armenians</HI> that live at <HI>Zulfa</HI> keep their Shops, and &s;ell all &s;orts of Cloth that comes out of <HI>Europe,</HI> and other the
<PB N="153" REF="92">
choice&s;t Wares of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> At the end of that <HI>Bazar</HI> &s;tands a fair Inn two Stories high, which the Mother of <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the &s;econd caus'd to be built. In the middle &s;tands a great Fountain with four great Gates, which lead into four other Inns. Here by the way let me give a Traveller and a Trader in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> this advice; that if his Goods be not very heavy, he never hire a low Chamber, as being three times dearer than tho&s;e above: For the Chambers which the Sun lies upon mo&s;t in the Summer, are the Chambers which co&s;t lea&s;t. Not but all the Chambers in the Inn are Tax'd at the &s;ame rate by the King; but the Ho&s;t for his profit will find &s;ome pretence or other to rai&s;e his price, pretending tho&s;e Chambers be hir'd already which you de&s;ire, e&s;pecially if they be corner Chambers, which are the large&s;t and mo&s;t commodious. And indeed without this collu&s;ion Chambers would be very cheap. The be&s;t convenience of tho&s;e Inns is, that a man is more &s;ecure in one of them then in a private Hou&s;e: For there if it happ'n that a piece of Goods be &s;tol'n; or that your Chapman prove in&s;olvent for Goods bought, the Inn-keeper is to make all good&punc; being by the Law to receive &s;o many blows aday 'till he pays the &s;um demanded. The Merchant al&s;o gives two in the hundred for every thing that he &s;ells, and when the Market is done they pre&s;ently go to the Ho&s;t, who &s;ets down in his Book the qua|lity of his Goods&punc; and the names both of buyer and &s;eller. If he knows not the buyer, he is bound to go and enquire after him, and if he be not &s;olvent, the Merchant takes his Goods again. Sometimes the Merchant to &s;ave the two in the hundred, combines with the Purcha&s;er to carry away &s;ome of his Goods without the knowledge of the Ho&s;t, which is done by grea&s;ing his Deputies fi&s;t, who will pre|&s;ently &s;hut his Eyes. But then if the Purcha&s;er proves in&s;olvent, the Merchant dares not complain, becau&s;e his Goods are not Regi&s;ter'd in the King's Book, whom he has defrauded of his Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>No le&s;s &s;ecure are the <HI>Bazars</HI> or Market-places, where the Merchants &s;hut up their Shops very &s;lightly, the <HI>Bazars</HI> being &s;trongly guarded both within and with|out all night long. As for the petty Stalls in the <HI>Meydan,</HI> every one puts up his Ware in a Box Padlock'd up, and then lay them down at one end of the place one by another. As for the cour&s;e &s;ort of Ware, as Tents, Cords, Ropes, and &s;uch other things they only heap them under a large Coverlet fa&s;ten'd at the four corners by four &s;ticks, for the <HI>Meydan</HI> al&s;o is as &s;trongly guarded as the <HI>Bazar.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Haly</HI>'s Gate and that which leads to the <HI>Bazar</HI> where the <HI>Armenians</HI> keep their Shops&punc; live all tho&s;e that deal in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Leather, making <HI>Borachio's</HI> to tye under the Hor&s;es Bellies&punc; little Buckets, and Furniture for Hor&s;e-men, as al&s;o Bowyers, Fletchers, and Forbi&s;hers. From the la&s;t Gate to the end of the Gallery, live all the Druggi&s;ts and Apothecaries.</P>
<P>At the Angle upon the two fronts upon the Ea&s;t and North, there is a Gate that leads to the Great <HI>Bazar;</HI> next to that live only your Salls-men that &s;ell whole Ha|bits for men, as Shirts, Sheets, Ho&s;e, and the like. There be al&s;o tho&s;e that &s;ell Leather Shoes for men and women; which Shoes are always worn by per&s;ons of quality.</P>
<P>Out of this <HI>Bazar</HI> you go into another full of men that work in Copper, &s;uch as make Pots, Plates, and other Uten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ils for the Kitchin. Here al&s;o live tho&s;e that make Files, and the blades of Sythes. The re&s;t of the <HI>Bazar</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Dyers of Calicut; and at the end of the <HI>Bazar</HI> is a fair Inn, where all the Merchants live that &s;ell Musk, <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Leather, and Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</P>
<P>I have in another place ob&s;erv'd that the King has a great Revenue out of the <HI>Ba|zars</HI> and Inns which he has caus'd to be built, which is particularly laid out in pro|vi&s;ion for his Table. For the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> forbidding Princes to impo&s;e Taxes or Cu&s;toms upon the People, they do not believe that the money which ari&s;es from thence is fit to be employ'd or laid out for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, believing that their food &s;o purchas'd would do them no good. By virtue of this prohibition of <HI>Mahomet</HI> it is, that the Merchants take all the liberty they can to deceive the King of his Cu&s;toms, believing that they cannot offend the Prince, while they tran&s;gre&s;s not the Law. Be&s;ides, that if they &s;hould pay all the King's Duties, the price of Goods would ri&s;e &s;o high, &s;o as to &s;poil the whole Cour&s;e of Trade and Commerce. Neither would the Reve|nue of the <HI>Caravan&s;era's, Bazars,</HI> and Gardens &s;uffice for the Kings Kitchin, were not the &s;everal <HI>Kans</HI> or Governours of Provinces oblig'd to &s;upply that expence eve|ry Week in their turns, whereby tho&s;e expences co&s;t the King little or nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="93">
Upon the North-Front of the <HI>Meydan,</HI> are made under the <HI>Portico's</HI> &s;eparations for Chambers, that look upon the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where people go to &s;moak Tobacco and drink Coffee. The Seats of tho&s;e Rooms are plac'd as in &s;o many Amphitheaters, and in the mid&s;t of every one &s;tands a large Ve&s;&s;el full of running Water, wherewith their Pipes be cleans'd when they are over-foul. All the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that have any &s;pare time, fail not every day to re&s;ort to tho&s;e places between &s;even and eight in the Morning, where the Owner of the Room pre&s;ently brings them every one their Pipe and their Di&s;h of Coffee. But the Great <HI>Sha&punc;Abas,</HI> who was a man of a great under|&s;tanding, finding tho&s;e places were only &s;o many Meeting-hou&s;es, where men a&s;&s;em|bl'd to talk and prattle of State-affairs, a thing which no way pleas'd him; to break the neck of tho&s;e petty Cabals, he order'd that a <HI>Moullah</HI> &s;hould be &s;ure to be betimes at every place before the re&s;t of the People came thither, and that he &s;hould entertain tho&s;e Tobacco-whiffers, and Coffee-quaffers, &s;ometimes with a point of the Law, &s;ometimes with Hi&s;tory, &s;ometimes with Poetry. This cu&s;tom is &s;till ob&s;erv'd: &s;o that after this entertainment has la&s;ted two or three hours, the <HI>Moullah</HI> ri&s;ing up, crys to every one in the Coffee-Room, <HI>Come my Ma&s;ters, in good time, let's all now retire every man to his bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Straight every one retires upon the <HI>Moullah</HI>'s words, who is liberally entertain'd all the while by the Society.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the North-Front &s;tands a great Portal, with a large Dial over it, which <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> brought from <HI>Ormus</HI> when he took it from the <HI>Portugals.</HI> But the Di|al is of no u&s;e, nor is ever like to be. Round the Tower of that Portal runs an op'n Gallery, with a kind of a Cieling over head &s;upported with Pillars; from whence every Evening about Sun-&s;et, and at Midnight, a noi&s;e of Drums and Trumpets is to be heard through the whole City. Though the truth is, the Mu&s;ick would ne|ver charm a curious Ear. Out of &s;ome parts of the Gallery are contriv'd little Dormi|tories, where the chiefe&s;t of the Court lye. In all the Cities where the <HI>Kans</HI> re&s;ide is the Cu&s;tom of making this ratling noi&s;e of Drums and Trumpets ob&s;erv'd, and not el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the Portal, under the Horologe, are five or &s;ix Banks of Jewellers, who there put to &s;ale certain parcels of Pearls, Emralds, Granats, and Turquoi&s;es, which are not of any great value: every parcel being &s;et by it &s;elf in a Di&s;h, and the whole Stall cover'd with a &s;ilk Net, to pre&s;erve the Stones from being &s;toln.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t again&s;t the &s;ame Portal, going toward the South-Front, you meet with two little Goals five or &s;ix Foot high, and &s;ev'n or eight di&s;tant one from the other. Here the men play at Pall-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll on hor&s;e-back, the Hor&s;e-man being to &s;trike the Ball run|ning at full &s;peed, between the two Goals.</P>
<P>Through that Portal you enter into an Enclo&s;ure much like the place where the Fair of St. <HI>Germans</HI> is kept, and there it is that the Merchants of Gold and Silver-Ti&s;&s;ues and other rich Stuffs, with all your fine&s;t &s;orts of Calicuts and Linnens, keep their Shops.</P>
<P>The Court &s;ide of the <HI>Meydan,</HI> which is upon the Ea&s;t, and which an&s;wers to the grand Front where the King's Hou&s;e &s;tands, is thus appointed. In the middle &s;tands a <HI>Duomo</HI> cover'd with a kind of bak'd Earth, and as well the <HI>Duomo</HI> as the Portal, which is very high, are all varni&s;h'd over. You a&s;cend nine or ten &s;teps, the Port of <HI>Haly</HI> facing it on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Piazza.</HI> From the end of the <HI>Portico's</HI> that touch the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> live the Shop-keepers that &s;ell &s;owing-Silk, and &s;mall Manufacturers of Silk, as Ribands, Laces, Garters, and other things of the &s;ame nature. From the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> to the other end, are all Turners, that make Cradles for Children, and Spinning-Wheels. There are al&s;o &s;ome Cotton-beaters, that make quilted Coverlets. Without the <HI>Portico's</HI> are none but Smiths, that make Scyths, Hammers, Pincers, Nails, and &s;uch like things; with &s;ome few Cutlers.</P>
<P>This is all that can be &s;aid of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and that great <HI>Piazza,</HI> which &s;ome per|haps have &s;et out in better colours.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> a little City, &s;eparated from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> by the River <HI>Senderou.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Z&V;lpha,</HI> which others call <HI>Julpha</HI> and <HI>Giolpha,</HI> is di&s;tant from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to|ward the South half an hours walk, the River <HI>Senderou</HI> running almo&s;t at an equal di&s;tance between the two Cities. The way that leads from one City to another is a Walk &s;ome fifteen hundred Paces long, and &s;eventeen broad, almo&s;t equally divided by the River. It begins from a Pavilion or Tabernacle forty Foot &s;quare, which joyns to the hinder part of the King's Hou&s;e, with a double Story, to which &s;everal Windows give light, clos'd with wooden Lattices very artificially wrought. None but the King and his Hou&s;hold pa&s;s that way into the Walk. For they that go from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> find the way into the Walk through a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e which is clo&s;e adjoyning to the Tabernacle. This Walk is call'd the Street of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> or the Street of <HI>Four Gardens.</HI></P>
<P>A Channel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uns all along the Walk from the Tabernacle, where a little Rivulet falls into it, and fills it as far as the great Bridge. The two &s;ides of the Channel which are pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d with Stone, and are two or three Foot broad, makes one way which Pa&s;&s;engers may&punc; and many times do take; for the u&s;ual way both for Hor&s;e and Foot, lyes upon each &s;ide of the Walk, behind the Trees, which are panted in a &s;treight line to the very Walls of the King's Gardens, which clo&s;e the Alley on each &s;ide. It is a kind of a Cau&s;ey of Free-&s;tone, &s;omewhat rais'd, and four or five Foot broad. There is but one row of Trees on each &s;ide, &s;traight and high, call'd <HI>Tchinards,</HI> with one tuft at the top. The &s;pace between the Channel and the Trees is not pav'd, but lyes common, and is &s;ometimes &s;ow'd. About two hundred Paces from the Tabernacle or Banqueting-hou&s;e, the River falls into a great Pool, about thirty or thirty-five Foot in diameter; and in that place, as al&s;o in others &s;omewhat beyond it, where there are al&s;o other Pools, the Walk is cro&s;s'd by a Cau&s;ey pav'd and rais'd, ten or twelve Foot broad, as the re&s;t are. Upon the left hand of the fir&s;t Pool &s;tands another Tabernacle or Banqueting-hou&s;e, much alike in &s;tructure and bigne&s;s to the former; in which place, in a low arch'd Room with a Fountain of Water in the middle, you may go and drink Coffee. From that hou&s;e to the Bridge the Walk de&s;cends, and the Water makes &s;ome falls.</P>
<P>All the Gardens on each &s;ide of the Walk, both on this &s;ide and beyond the Bridge belong to the King. But you mu&s;t not imagin that the&s;e Gardens, or that of <HI>Hezardgerib,</HI> which is the faire&s;t of all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> are &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;et out, nor &s;o well kept as ours in <HI>Europe.</HI> For they have no &s;uch lovely Borders, nor &s;uch clo&s;e Walks of Honey&s;uckles and Ja&s;min as are to be &s;een in the Gardens of <HI>Europe.</HI> They &s;uffer the Gra&s;s to grow in many places; contented only with a good many great Fruit-trees, tufted a-top, and planted in a line, which is all the grace of the Gardens of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>In each &s;ide of the Walls between which the Walk runs, at a true di&s;tance of &s;pace, are gates neatly contriv'd, and over each a little Room. Almo&s;t in the middle of the Walk between the great Banqueting-hou&s;e and the Bridge, upon the left hand, &s;tands a Hou&s;e of the <HI>Dervi's,</HI> to whom the King has given one of his Gardens to build upon. There they keep the Relicks of <HI>Haly,</HI> or &s;ome other Prophet; for you &s;hall &s;ee them &s;tanding under a certain Arch, before which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> make a mo&s;t profound Reverence. The&s;e <HI>Dervi's</HI> come every Afternoon about three or four a Clock into the <HI>Bazars</HI> of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> every two, an old one and a young one, choo&s;ing his quarter. They go from Shop to Shop, in&s;tructing the People upon &s;ome Point or other of the Law: the young <HI>Dervi's</HI> an&s;wering the old ones at certain times. Their Habit is only two Sheep-skins or Goat-skins, the one hanging before, the other behind, with a great leathern Girdle, four or five fingers broad, garni&s;h'd with &s;everal great Plates of Latten. They throw another Sheep-skin cro&s;s their Shoulders, which they tye before, under their Chins. Upon their Heads they only wear a little Lamb-skin in form of a Bonnet, letting the feet hang down to their Necks,
<PB N="156" REF="94">
over their Cheeks. They carry a great Club in their hands, as the Painters repre&s;ent <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s. Between their Girdles and their wa&s;ts they &s;tuff a company of pitiful Flowers, or el&s;e a &s;ort of Herbs, which after Exhortation, both the young, and the old <HI>Dervi's</HI> be&s;tow upon the Merchants and Trade&s;men, from whom at the &s;ame time they receive Alms. Toward the evening they go home again; and I forgot to tell you, that before the door of the hou&s;e, &s;tands always a large Ve&s;&s;el of water, with &s;everal little Cups, and Ice in the Summer, where all pa&s;&s;engers may drink upon free-co&s;t.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Senderou,</HI> which, as well as the re&s;t of the Rivers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> except the <HI>Aras,</HI> is not able to carry a Boat, is a very great relief to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Behind the Mountains of the South beyond <HI>Zulpha</HI> is another River, call'd <HI>Abkuren,</HI> which a|bout five or &s;ix Leagues above <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> runs within a League and a half of <HI>Senderou. Sha-Abas</HI> the fir&s;t attempted to have joyn'd the two Rivers together, to which pur|po&s;e he went about to have remov'd certain Rocks that &s;tood in his way; but not being able to compa&s;s his de&s;ign, his Succe&s;&s;ors laid a&s;ide all the thoughts of attem|pting any more. Could it have been done, the Campaign of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> would have been one of the mo&s;t fertile and delicious places in the world; whereas now the River is of no u&s;e, running through de&s;art Countreys and Plains of Salt. As for the River of <HI>Senderou,</HI> in Winter it over-flows, but in Summer it has very little water, being oftner foarded than cro&s;s'd over upon Bridges. About four Leagues above <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> they are con&s;train'd to force it into their Lands, to water their Fields and Grounds, which el&s;e would produce nothing at all. Wells they have a great many in &s;everal places; but be&s;ides that, they are not able to furni&s;h that great quantity of water which is nece&s;&s;ary; the River Water is much better to fatten the Land. Now you mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that their Channels never return to the River, being wa&s;ted upon the Ground; &s;o that the River of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> being very much wa&s;ted before it comes to the City, by rea&s;on that it is &s;till le&s;&s;en'd by &s;o many Channels, about ten or twelve Leagues from thence, it ends as it were quite &s;pent in a few Mer&s;hes. This &s;carcity of water which is &s;o general over all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is the rea&s;on that they are extraordinary Husdands of it, and buy it very dear. Therefore is the Superintendent of the water, which brings the King in a very con&s;iderable Revenue, one of the mo&s;t contended-for em|ployments in the whole Court. For every Garden is tax'd more or le&s;s according to its bigne&s;s, for the water it requires once a week; which water is let go into the quarters which have need of it; every Garden having a particular Channel, whence they have their water by turns. But you mu&s;t have a care of attempting to bring this water in before your turn; for &s;hould it come to be known, an ea&s;ie Fine would not excu&s;e the matter. I knew two <HI>Franks,</HI> who, becau&s;e they pre&s;um'd to take in water in the night time before it was their turn, had like to have lo&s;t all their Land by Confi&s;cation, had it not been for the particular Favour of the King to the <HI>Franks;</HI> and yet all that favour did not excu&s;e them from being &s;oundly amerc'd.</P>
<P>There are four Bridges a quarter of a Leagues di&s;tance one from another, that cro&s;s the River of <HI>Senderou</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> That which cro&s;&s;es the walk, bears the name of <HI>Alywerdi-Kan,</HI> who caus'd it to be built, being al&s;o call'd the Bridge of <HI>Zulfa.</HI> It is built of good Brick, joyn'd together with Free-&s;tone, and very level, not being higher in the middle than at either end. It is not above three hundred and fifty paces long, and twenty broad, being &s;upported by &s;everal &s;mall Arches of Stone, which are very low. Of each &s;ide there is a Gallery eight or nine foot broad, which runs from one end to the other, &s;everal Arches twenty five or thirty foot high &s;upporting the Platform, where, when the heat is not extream, they that plea&s;e may walk for the &s;ake of the fre&s;h Air. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual pa&s;&s;age is under the Galleries, where there are &s;everal out-lets upon the River, to let in the fre&s;h Air. For the Galleries are very high, from the level of the Bridge, to which you a&s;cend by ea&s;ie &s;teps, the middle of the Bridge not being above twenty five foot broad, &s;erving for Wagons and Pack-hor&s;es. There is al&s;o another way all along by the water &s;ide, where there are &s;everal Stones laid to &s;tep upon, to keep you from being wet-&s;hod. It cro&s;&s;es through all the Arches of the Bridge, through little doors made in every Arch from one end to the other, de&s;cending from the Bridge by a little pair of Stairs, tak'n out of the thickne&s;s of the Arches &s;upporters. There is another Stair|ca&s;e to a&s;cend up to the Galleries of about two fathoms broad, with Stays or Rails on both &s;ides. This Bridge is truly a very neat piece of Architecture, if I may not &s;ay, the neate&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="94">
There are al&s;o three other Bridges upon the River, one above the Bridge of <HI>Zulfa,</HI> and two below. The fir&s;t but meanly built, but very commodious for the <HI>Armerians,</HI> when they travel We&s;tward, who would el&s;e be forc'd to go a great way about, through the whole City of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the other two Bridges below the Bridge of <HI>Zulfa,</HI> was built by <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the &s;econd, Father of the pre&s;ent King. It is almo&s;t equal to it in Structure; but it has one particular beauty, which is a hexagonal place in the middle of the Bridge, which cau&s;es the Water to fall in that part with a plea&s;ing noi&s;e. For that being the deepe&s;t part of the River, <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> re&s;olv'd to build a Bridge there; partly for the <HI>Gaurs</HI> &s;ake, to the end, they might not come through the walk of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> and that going from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> they might have a &s;horter cut home. The Habitation of the <HI>Gaurs</HI> is only a large Village, the fir&s;t Hou&s;es whereof are but a little way from the River; though the walk that goes from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to the <HI>King's Bridge</HI> is both longer and broader than that of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> planted on both &s;ides with a row of Trees, but no Channel in the middle.</P>
<P>Before each of the Avenues to the Bridge, &s;tands a Hou&s;e that belongs to the King for his diverti&s;ement. That upon the left &s;ide of the River toward <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> was by the great <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> giv'n to the <HI>Capuchins.</HI> For as &s;oon as they came to <HI>I&s;pa|han,</HI> upon their Examination, the King was extreamly tak'n with their behaviour. He ask'd them how they liv'd, and whether they took any money? To which the <HI>Capuchins</HI> making an&s;wer, that they never handled any money, but contented them|&s;elves with Alms; the King believing his Subjects, would give them very little, be&s;tow'd that Hou&s;e and Garden upon them. But they &s;tay'd not long there, be|cau&s;e it was too big for them to repair, and too far from the City, &s;o that the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> in the Winter could not get to their Chappel. Now they have built them|&s;elves a very hand&s;om Hou&s;e not far from the King's Palace, at the Co&s;t of Father <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> one of their own order.</P>
<P>There is another old Bridge a quarter of a League below the <HI>Gaurs</HI> Bridge, which is upon the Road from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the long-walk of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> which continues above eight hun|dred paces beyond the Bridge of <HI>Zulfa</HI> to the Garden of <HI>Hezardgerib.</HI> The Rivu|let that pa&s;&s;es that other part of the walk, comes from the &s;ame River which they have cut three or four Leagues above <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> When you have walk'd about four hundred paces, you met with a fall of Waters that tumbles into a Pool, from whence there are twelve &s;teps to a&s;cend to the end of the Alley. The walk is fronted by the great Hou&s;e which &s;tands before the Garden of <HI>Hezardgerib,</HI> or <HI>the thou&s;and Acres.</HI> The Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts but only of one great Hall over the Gate, and four &s;mall Chambers at the four corners of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hezardgerib</HI> is the faire&s;t Garden in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> though it would be accounted no|thing in <HI>Europe.</HI> However as it lies upon the de&s;cent of a Hill, it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen <HI>Tera&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd by a Wall &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen foot high. There is but little Water in any of the Wells; but that which has mo&s;t is in the fourth <HI>Terra&s;s.</HI> That is a great Octagonal Pool about a hundred and twenty foot in Diameter, round about which are &s;everal Pipes that throw up the Water about three foot high, and there are three &s;teps down to the Water. A Channel pav'd with Stone runs through the principal Alley, which goes no farther than the building. This Channel is as wide as that of the Channel of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> whence it is &s;upply'd as being right oppo|&s;ite to it. In the tenth <HI>Terra&s;s</HI> you meet with another Fountain of the &s;ame bigne&s;s and form with that in the fourth; and in the la&s;t which terminates the Grand Alley and the length of the Garden, there is another Channel which cro&s;&s;es all the Alleys which&punc; like the great one compo&s;e the leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h of the Alley. Be&s;ides this, there are op'n Rooms to take the fre&s;h Air, &s;ome falls and murmurs of Water, but for borders and clo&s;e Alleys, and Arbours, you mu&s;t expect no &s;uch thing, either in <HI>Hezardgerib,</HI> nor in any other part of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Having walk'd in the great walk of <HI>Tcharbag,</HI> you meet upon the right hand with a Street between two Walls of the Gardens that belong to the King, which Street leads you to <HI>Zulfa,</HI> not above two or three Mu&s;quet Shots di&s;tance off.</P>
<P><HI>Zulfa</HI> a Colony of <HI>Armenians</HI> which <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> brought from <HI>Zulfa,</HI> a City of <HI>Armenia,</HI> is &s;o much encreas'd for &s;ome years &s;ince, that it may now pa&s;s for a

large City, being almo&s;t a League and a half long, and near upon half as much broad. There are two principal Streets which contain near upon the whole length, one whereof has on each &s;ide a row of <HI>Tchinars,</HI> the roots whereof are refre&s;h'd by a &s;mall Channel of Water, which by a particular order the <HI>Armenians</HI> bring to the City, to water their Gardens. The mo&s;t part of the other Streets have al&s;o a row of Trees, and a Channel. And for their Hou&s;es, they are generally better built, and more chearful than tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the De&s;cri|ption of <HI>Zul|pha.</HI></NOTE> How they came to be &s;etled here, I have already de&s;crib'd: And now the number of Inhabitants is &s;trangely increas'd by the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal other Chri&s;tians of divers Sects, as <HI>Jacobites, Cophtes,</HI> and <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> who formerly liv'd in the Suburbs of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Neither was <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> &s;o cruel in tran&s;planting the <HI>Armenians</HI> away out of their own Countrey, for they were all at that &s;ea&s;on poor labouring men, who knew not at all what belong'd to Trade. Since that time they are grown very rich: &s;o that the <HI>Armenians</HI> have no cau&s;e to be covetous of the Habitations of their Ance&s;tors. And now I will tell you how they came to be &s;uch great Proficients in Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> who was a man of a great Genius, and a per&s;on of great undertaking, con&s;idering that <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was a barren Countrey, where there was little Trade, and by con&s;equence little Money, re&s;olv'd to &s;end his Subjects into <HI>Europe</HI> with raw Silks, &s;o to under&s;tand whence the be&s;t profit would ari&s;e, to bring Money into his Country. To which purpo&s;e, he re&s;olv'd to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all the Silk in his own Country, by purcha&s;ing it him&s;elf at a rea&s;onable rate, tax'd by him&s;elf, and to reap the gains by his Factors: and withal, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek an Alliance with the great Kings of <HI>Europe,</HI> to engage them on his &s;ide again&s;t the <HI>Turk.</HI> He fir&s;t &s;ent to the King of <HI>France, Henry</HI> the Fourth. But he dying before the Am|ba&s;&s;ador arriv'd, an&s;wer was made the Amba&s;&s;ador, That if the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had any thing to &s;ay to the King of <HI>France Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, he mu&s;t &s;end a new Amba&s;&s;ador, which was never done.</P>
<P>Three or four years after he &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> accom|pany'd with a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> putting into their hands a con&s;iderable quantity of Bales of Silk. He al&s;o &s;ent along with them a <HI>Portuguez Au&s;tin-Friar,</HI> to be their Guide and Interpreter. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant would have &s;old the Silks, as was the King's order, and have bought a Pre&s;ent more becoming. But the Amba&s;&s;ador over-rul'd by the Friar, re&s;olv'd to pre&s;ent the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with the Bales of Silk. The Merchant not able to oppo&s;e the Amba&s;&s;ador, returns home forthwith to give an account to the King, who approv'd his management. The Amba&s;&s;ador proceeds, and coming to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court, pre&s;ents his Bales of Silk to the King, who ask'd the Amba&s;&s;ador, whether his Ma&s;ter took him for a Woman, that he had &s;ent him &s;o many Bales of Silk to &s;pin; and immediately &s;ent away the Pre&s;ent to his Queen, pre&s;enting the Amba&s;&s;ador but very meanly: who thereupon &s;eeing the Errour he had committed, made ha&s;t home; but upon his return, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King having notice of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his Negotiation, caus'd his Belly to be ript op'n in the publick Market-place.</P>
<P>About fifteen years after, he tru&s;ted a con&s;iderable quantity of Silk with a Merchant's Son of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and &s;ent him to <HI>Venice:</HI> who when he came there, took a &s;tately Lodging, and &s;pent his Money at a &s;trange rate, e&s;pecially among the Courti&s;ans; to maintain which expence, he continually &s;old great quantities of Silk. The <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;eeing a private man live &s;o &s;plendidly among them, and not believing &s;o great a quantity of Goods could belong to one &s;ingle Merchant, but rather imagining him to be a Factor for &s;ome Company who &s;uffer'd for his folly, wrote to all the Ports of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and having intelligence who he was, the Senate thought fit to &s;eize his Per&s;on and his Goods, before he had con&s;um'd all; at the &s;ame time giving a civil account to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> what they had done. To which the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King return'd a mo&s;t obliging An&s;wer of Thanks, &s;ending withal an intelligent <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant to take an account of what was left, to whom the <HI>Venetians</HI> were very punctual. As for the Prodigal <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> who thought it not his wi&s;e&s;t way to return into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> what became of him is not material to this Story.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abas</HI> by the&s;e Experiments ob&s;erving the little inclination of his Subjects to Trade, who were naturally addicted to Pride and Expence, which is no part of a Merchant's bu&s;ine&s;s, ca&s;t his Eyes upon the <HI>Armenians,</HI> men able to endure the
 
<PB N="159" REF="95">
labour of long Journeys, &s;ober per&s;ons, and great Husbands, and &s;uch who being Chri&s;tians, might more freely Trade among the Chri&s;tians; and made choice of them, as being mo&s;t proper and fit for Trade. Whereupon, picking out the mo&s;t Judicious among them, he deliver'd to every one &s;o many Bales of Silk, according to their Capacity; for which they were to pay at their return, a rea&s;onable Rate tax'd by the King, who allow'd them what more they got for their Expences and Gains. Tho&s;e people in a &s;hort time became &s;o expert, that there is not any &s;ort of Trade which they will not now undertake; for now they run as far as <HI>Tunquin, Java,</HI> and the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> and indeed over all the Ea&s;t, except <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> But if they do not thrive, they never return; as being a place where they mu&s;t either give an exact Account, or el&s;e &s;uffer the quick and &s;evere Ju&s;tice of Drubbing, which never fails tho&s;e Factors that are ill Husbands for their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>And indeed the <HI>Armenians</HI> are &s;o much the more fit for Trading, becau&s;e they are a people very &s;paring, and very &s;ober; though whether it be their virtue or their avarice, I know not. For when they are going a long Journey, they only make provi&s;ion of Bisket, &s;moak'd <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s fle&s;h, Onions, bak'd Butter, Flowr, Wine, and dry'd Fruits. They never buy fre&s;h Victuals, but when they meet with Lambs or Kids very cheap in the Mountainous Countries; nor is there one of them that does not carry his Angle to fi&s;h withal, when they come to any Ponds or Rivers. All the&s;e provi&s;ions co&s;t them little the Carriage. And when they come to any Town where they are to &s;tay, they club five or &s;ix together, and lye in an empty Chamber which they furni&s;h them&s;elves; every one carrying his Mattre&s;s, his Coverlet, and his Kitchin-In&s;truments, which is a great piece of Thrift. When they travel into Chri&s;tendom, they carry along with them Saffron, Pepper, Nutmegs, and other Spices; which they exchange in the Country-Towns for Bread, Wine, Butter, Chee&s;e, Milk-Meats, and other Provi&s;ions which they buy of the poor Wo|men. When they return out of Chri&s;tendom, they bring along with them all &s;orts of Mercery-ware, and Pedlery-ware of <HI>Noremberg</HI> and <HI>Venice;</HI> as little Looking|gla&s;&s;es, trifles of Tin enamel'd, fal&s;e Pearls, and other things of that nature; which pays for the Victuals they call for among the Country-people.</P>
<P>In the beginning of their Trade, there return'd very few <HI>Caravans</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> without two hundred thou&s;and Crowns in Silver, be&s;ide <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Clothes, fine Ti&s;&s;ues, Looking-gla&s;&s;es, <HI>Venice</HI> Pearls, Cochenel, and Watches; which they thought mo&s;t proper for the Sale of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>At length tho&s;e <HI>Armenians</HI> became &s;o exqui&s;ite in Trade, that &s;everal of them have left E&s;tates of two, &s;ome twenty thou&s;and <HI>Tomans.</HI> But the riche&s;t among them was <HI>Cotgia,</HI> or Mon&s;ieur <HI>Petrus,</HI> who left forty thou&s;and <HI>Tomans</HI> in coyn'd Money, be&s;ides his Hor&s;es, Furniture, and Lands in the Country, his Jewels and Plate; all which are never reckon'd a Merchant's E&s;tate, but only the ready Ca&s;h with which he trades. <HI>Cotgia Petrus</HI> was very much e&s;teem'd for his Charity, and the great Church which he built, which is a kind of Covent, with a Bi&s;hop and Monks. Nor is the fair Market-place, all environ'd with Shops, a little beholding to his Gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> of <HI>Zulpha</HI> have this advantage over all the Chri&s;tians of the Ea&s;t, that they enjoy Lands and Priviledges, the King not permitting the lea&s;t inju&s;tice to be done them, nor that any <HI>Mahometan</HI> &s;hould live at <HI>Zulpha.</HI> They have al&s;o the priviledge to be as well clad as the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and to make u&s;e as they do of Bri|dles of Gold and Silver. Their Wives al&s;o are very richly habited, in &s;trip'd Sattins purfl'd with Gold, and other rich <HI>Europaean</HI> Silks.</P>
<P>The King names whom he plea&s;es among the <HI>Armenians</HI> to be their Chief; whom they call <HI>Kelonter,</HI> who judges all their differences, and taxes them to make up the Sum which they are to pay to the King every year.</P>
<P>The Language of the <HI>Armenians</HI> is either vulgar or learned: the learned is only us'd by the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, in reference to their Religion. They write like us, from the left to the right, having found out peculiar Characters about four years &s;ince. They have three Languages very natural to them, which however are very different: the <HI>Armenian,</HI> which is their ancient Country &s;peech, which they have pre&s;erv'd from Father to Son; the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> which is the Language of the Country where they live; and the <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> of which they make very much u&s;e in cour&s;e of Trade. As for their Women, they &s;peak nothing but the <HI>Armenian,</HI> as having no conver&s;e with
<PB N="160" REF="96">
&s;trangers, and never &s;tirring out of their hou&s;es. There are &s;ome <HI>Armenians</HI> &s;peak <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> as having learnt it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There are in <HI>Zulpha</HI> fifteen or &s;ixteen Churches and Chappels of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> among which you are to count two Nunneries for Women. There are in <HI>I&s;pahan Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars, <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and in <HI>Zulpha Je&s;uits.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> that came la&s;t have but a little Hou&s;e, but to make them amends they have a large Garden. Though the number of the Religious Teachers is far greater then the number of Hearers: for in all <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and <HI>Zulpha,</HI> take the <HI>Franks</HI> that come out of <HI>Europe,</HI> or born in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as well Men as Women, there are not &s;ix hundred per&s;ons that profe&s;s the Catholick Religion. As for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they are &s;o ob&s;tinately fix'd to their own Religion, that they will hear of no other; and nothing but Money has &s;ome|times caus'd them to feign the embracing of another. Friar <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> a <HI>Capuchin</HI> &s;taid a while at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> to whom &s;everal of the principal <HI>Armenians</HI> came to School to learn <HI>French,</HI> in hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing a Trade with <HI>France.</HI> But the <HI>Armenian</HI> Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops fearing le&s;t the Children &s;hould be infected with &s;ome other Religion, excommunicated all Fathers that &s;ent their Children to School. And finding that they little regarded the Excommunication, they &s;hut up the Church doors, and &s;tir'd up the People again&s;t the Religious <HI>Franks;</HI> &s;o that Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> was forc'd to leave <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and retire to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover there are in <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Idolaters. Nor are the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;o mi&s;erable and beggarly, as they &s;eem to be&punc; they intrude, according to cu&s;tom, into all Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that if any has a mind to buy or &s;ell any rich Jewel, he need do no more but &s;peak to them. In the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> the <HI>Athemadoule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> per&s;ecuted them &s;o grievou&s;ly, that either by force or by cunning he caus'd them to turn <HI>Mahometans;</HI> but the King under&s;tanding that only power and fear had con&s;train'd them to turn, &s;uffer'd them to re&s;ume their own Religion, and to live in quiet.</P>
<P>There are about ten or twelve thou&s;and <HI>Banians</HI> in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> who are known by their yellow Complexions, or rather by a yellow Mark made with Saffron upon the top of their Foreheads. Their Turbants are le&s;s than u&s;ual, and their Shoes are almo&s;t like ours, embroider'd with Flowers a-top. They are all Bankers, and very knowing in Money. The greate&s;t part of the Money of the principal Money'd men of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is in their hands for improvement &s;ake. So that if you want a con&s;iderable Sum, you may have it the next day upon good Security, and paying a &s;evere Intere&s;t, which tho&s;e <HI>Banians</HI> will &s;queez up &s;ometimes to 18 <HI>per Cent.</HI> But if it be not very privately exacted and paid, the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which forbids the taking of Intere&s;t, lays hold upon the whole Sum, and confi&s;cates it every Penny.</P>

<P>THE difference among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> doth not con&s;i&s;t in the different Explanations which they put upon the <HI>Aleoran;</HI> but in the &s;everal Opi|nions which they hold concerning the fir&s;t Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> from which have aris'n two particular Sects entirely oppo&s;ite; the Sect of the <HI>Sunnis,</HI> and the Sect of the <HI>Schiais.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t, who are of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> belief, maintain that <HI>Abou-baker</HI> &s;ucceeded im|mediately to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as his Vicar or Vicegerent; to him <HI>Omar;</HI> to <HI>Omar O&s;man&punc;</HI> to <HI>O&s;man Mortuz-Ali,</HI> Nephew and Son-in-law to <HI>Mahomet</HI> by Marriage of his Daughter. That <HI>O&s;man</HI> was Secretary to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> a per&s;on of Courage, as well as the other three&punc; and that they were all valiant Souldiers, and great Captains, who extended their Conque&s;ts more by force of Arms than by Rea&s;on. And thence it comes that the <HI>Sunnis</HI> will not allow of Di&s;putes, but propagate and maintain their Religion altogether by force.</P>
<P>The <HI>Schiais,</HI> who are of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> belief, dete&s;t <HI>Abou-baker, Omar,</HI> and <HI>O&s;man,</HI> as U&s;urpers to the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which only belong'd to <HI>Haly,</HI> his Nephew

<P>I come now to the Grand Fe&s;tival of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which is the famous Fea&s;t of <HI>Hocen</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein.</HI></P>
<P>Eight days before the Fe&s;tival begins, &s;ome of the more zealous &s;ort black all their Bodies and their Faces, and go naked in the Streets with only a covering about their &s;ecret parts. They carry two Flints, one in each hand, which they knock one again&s;t another, wrything their Bodies, and making a thou&s;and antick Faces; and all the while crying out, <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein, Hocen; Hocen, Hu&s;&s;ein;</HI> which they act and &s;peak with &s;o much Labour, 'till they foam again at the mouth. In the Evening, the devout people admit them into their Hou&s;es, and feed them very well. During tho&s;e days, as &s;oon as the Sun is &s;et, you &s;hall &s;ee at the corners where &s;everal Streets meet, Pulpits &s;et up for certain Preachers, who prepare the people that flock to hear them to the devotion of the Fea&s;t. Now in regard all Ages, and Sexes go, there is no time in all the year &s;o favourable for the Women to meet their Gal|lants.</P>
<P>In the year 1667. the third of <HI>July,</HI> I &s;aw the Fe&s;tival by the favour of the <HI>Nagar,</HI> who appointed me a place ju&s;t again&s;t the <HI>D&eacute;la</HI> where the King &s;ate.

<HEAD>Of their Original, and their Prophets.</HEAD>
<P>THey &s;ay that the Father of their Prophet was a <HI>Frank</HI> by Nation, who&s;e Name was <HI>Azer&punc;</HI> and a Carver by Trade. That he left his own Country to live in theirs, which at that time was the City of <HI>Babylon;</HI> where he took a Wife who call'd her &s;elf <HI>Dogbdon.</HI> That one night his Wife dreamt that God had &s;ent an Angel from Para|di&s;e to vi&s;it her, who brought her very rich Cloaths, which &s;he put on. That a Cele&s;tial Light pre&s;ently over-&s;pread her Face, and render'd her as beautiful as the Sun; and that when &s;he wak'd &s;he found her-&s;elf with Child, which Child prov'd to be the Prophet <HI>Ebrahim-zer-Ateucht.</HI> That the A&s;trologers of that time, by their skill in the Stars knew of the Birth of that Infant &s;ent by God, who was to govern Men, and reign in their Hearts. That tho&s;e A&s;trologers went and declar'd the &s;ame thing to the King, telling him that there was a Child &s;uddenly to be born, that would one day reprive him of his Crown. Whereupon the &s;aid King, call'd <HI>Neu|brout,</HI> and a great Tyrant, caus'd all the Women with Child to be put to death, through the whole extent of his Dominions.</P>
<P>But by a Miracle the big Belly of the Mother of their Prophet not appearing, &s;he remain'd undi&s;cover'd, and brought forth a Son. Her Husband, who knew nothing of this My&s;tery, fearing he &s;hould lo&s;e his head if he did not di&s;cover the bu&s;ine&s;s to the King, before he found it out another way, went and confe&s;s'd that he had a Child born, but that he knew nothing of her being with Child.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that contrary to the cu&s;tom of other Children, that cry &s;o &s;oon as they come out of the Mothers womb, this Child laugh'd &s;o &s;oon as he was born. For being to triumph over the Hearts of the people, he was to &s;hew &s;igns of joy; &s;o that the people began already to rejoyce in their future felicities. This being &s;ignifi'd to the King, he call'd his A&s;trologers together, to tell him the meaning of &s;o extraor|dinary a thing, and what would become of the Infant. But the A&s;trologers not being able to &s;atisfie him, he &s;ent for the Infant, and would have &s;lain him with a Sword with his own hand, but God dry'd up his Arm immediately, &s;o that he could not. However, not terrifi'd with &s;o great a puni&s;hment, tran&s;ported with Choler, he caus'd a great Fire to be kindled, and commanded the Infant to be thrown into it. But by the power of God, the Fire which he had prepar'd to con&s;ume the Infant turn'd into a Bed of Ro&s;es, where the Child mo&s;t &s;weetly repos'd.</P>
<P>They who from that hour began to honour the little Prophet, took away &s;ome of that Fire, which has been pre&s;erv'd to this time. They keep it, &s;ay they, in honour of &s;o great a Miracle; and they have it in great veneration, becau&s;e it di&s;cover'd the merit of their Prophet.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the King &s;top'd not there, but &s;till ob&s;tinate in his impiety, notwith|&s;tanding all the&s;e Miracles, he prepar'd new torments for the little Infant; but God cha&s;tis'd his incredulity and that of his people very &s;everely, by &s;ending &s;uch an in|finite number of Flies, and that of &s;uch a pe&s;tiferous nature, that who-ever were &s;tung with them dy'd without remedy, unle&s;s they immediately came and wor&s;hip'd the Prophet, and ki&s;s'd his Feet, in te&s;timony of their repentance. As for the King, who &s;till continu'd in his impenitency, an exemplary fate befel him. For one or tho&s;e Flies &s;tinging him in one of his Ears, he dy'd a mo&s;t tormenting death.</P>
<P>His Succe&s;&s;or was <HI>Sha-Glochtes.</HI> He al&s;o at the beginning of his Reign began to per&s;ecute the little Infant, who now began to increa&s;e in years and vertue. The King impri&s;on'd him: but he was a&s;toni&s;h'd when he heard that one of his Hor&s;es, which he always confided in when he went to Battel, as being a&s;&s;ur'd of Victory when he rode him, had lo&s;t his four legs.

The Prophet willing to do him that favour, pray'd to God four times, and every time he pray'd one leg return'd to the Hor&s;e again. The King beholding &s;uch a Miracle, was half converted; but being de&s;irous to be farther con|vinc'd, he de&s;ir'd the Prophet to throw him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> into a B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">th of melted Silver, which he would provide for him&punc; promi&s;ing if he came out &s;afe, that he and all his People would receive him as one &s;ent from God, and be obedient to his Precepts in all things.

<P>The Prophet perceiving that all the people had him in &s;o much veneration, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th|drew him&s;elf, and would not be &s;een any more.

<P>So &s;oon as Women or Maids perceive the cu&s;tom of Nature upon them, they pre|&s;ently leave their Hou&s;es, and &s;tay alone in the Fields in little Hutts made of Hurdles or Watlings, with a Cloth at the entring in, which &s;erves for a Door. While they are in that condition, they have Meat and Drink brought them every day; and when they are free, they &s;end according to their quality, a Kid, or a Hen, or a Pigeon for an Offering; after which they go to the Bath, and then invite &s;ome few of their Kind|red to &s;ome &s;mall Collation.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Gaurs</HI> drink Wine both men and women, and eat Swines&punc;fle&s;h, provided it be of their own breeding and feeding. They are very careful le&s;t their Hogs eat any ordure; for &s;hould they perceive that they had devour'd any thing of na&s;tine&s;s, they are &s;trictly forbid'n to eat them. They never pare their Nails; &s;o that if by way of di&s;grace, or by any misfortune they are con&s;train'd to cut their Nails or their Hair, they carry that which they cut off to &s;ome place appointed without the City for that purpo&s;e. Five days in a year they ab&s;tain from Meat, Fi&s;h, Butter, and Eggs; and three other days they fa&s;t altogether 'till Evening. They have al&s;o thirty Holy|days in honour of thirty of their Saints, which they keep very &s;trictly, no man dar|ing to work. But the day of the Birth of their Prophet is celebrated with an extra|ordinary Pomp; be&s;ides that then they be&s;tow large Alms.</P>
<P>There is one day in the year when all the Women of every City and Village meet together to kill all the Frogs they can find in the fields; and this is done by the Com|mand of their Prophet, who was one day very much annoy'd by them.</P>
<P>Their Prie&s;ts have &s;everal Books full of &s;mall Pictures in Water-Colours, ill done, repre&s;enting how the &s;everal Sins of Men &s;hall be puni&s;h'd in Hell, e&s;pecially Sodomy, which they abominate.</P>

They neither burn nor bury their dead, but carry the Corps without the City, into a wall'd place, where are abundance of Stakes &s;even or eight Foot high, fix'd in the ground, and tye the dead Corps to one of the Stakes, with his Face toward the Ea&s;t. They that accompany the Corps fall to their Prayers at a di&s;tance, 'till the Crows come; for tho&s;e Cemitaries draw the Crows to them. If the Crow chances to fa&s;ten upon the right Eye of the deceas'd, then they believe the per&s;on to be happy, and for joy they give large Alms, and make a Fea&s;t in the field. But if the Crow fixes upon the left Eye, then they take it for an ill <HI>Omen,</HI> return home &s;ad, without &s;peaking to one another; give no Alms, nor eat nor drink.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Adoration of Fire.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Gaurs</HI> would not be thought to give Honour to Fire under the title of Ado|ration. For they do not account them&s;elves Idolaters, &s;aying that they acknow|ledge but only one God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, whom they only adore. As for the Fire, they pre&s;erve it and reverence it, in remembrance of the great Miracle, by which their Prophet was deliver'd from the Flames. One day being at <HI>Kerman,</HI> I de&s;ir'd to &s;ee that Fire, but they an&s;wer'd me, they could not permit me. For &s;ay they, one day the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Kerman</HI> being de&s;irous to &s;ee the Fire, not daring to do otherwi&s;e, they &s;hew'd it him. He it &s;eems expected to &s;ee &s;ome extraordinary Brightne&s;s; but when he &s;aw no more then what he might have &s;een in a Kitchin or a Chamber-fire, fell a &s;wearing and &s;pitting upon't as if he had been mad. Where|upon the Sacred Fire being thus profan'd, flew away in the form of a white Pigeon. The Prie&s;ts con&s;idering then their misfortune, which had happen'd through their own indi&s;cretion, fell to their Prayers with the People, and gave Alms; upon which, at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame form the Sacred Fire return'd to its place: which makes them &s;o &s;hy to &s;hew it again. When they put any per&s;ons to their Oaths, they Swear them before this Fire; for they think no per&s;on &s;o impious, as to &s;wear fal&s;e before that Sacred Fire, which they take for the Witne&s;s of their Oath. Their Prie&s;ts put them in dread of very great puni&s;hments, and threat'n them that the hea|venly Fire will for&s;ake them, if they prove &s;o wicked as to &s;wear fal&s;ely before it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Manners and Cu&s;toms.</HEAD>
<P>THe Language of the <HI>Gaurs</HI> is different from the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as is their Character and manner of Writing. They love to fea&s;t, and to eat and drink well, being very profu&s;e of their Wine and Strong-water. They never eat Hares, becau&s;e they have their monthly Purgations, like Women: for the &s;ame rea&s;on they never eat Mulber|ries, believing that they partake of the nature of Women and Hares.</P>
<P>If, when they comb their Hair or their Beards, any one hair happ'ns to fall upon their cloaths, tho&s;e cloaths mu&s;t be wa&s;h'd in the &s;tale of a Cow or an Ox to purifie them again. If by chance they happ'n to touch any ordure or na&s;tine&s;s, when they come home they mu&s;t wa&s;h them&s;elves in the &s;ame Urin. If one of their Prie&s;ts meet a dead Corps in the High-way, and chances to &s;ee it, he is oblig'd to wa&s;h him&s;elf in Cows-Pi&s;s, which they hold to be a good Purification: an Opinion held in &s;ome parts of <HI>India</HI> al&s;o. I ask'd one of their Prie&s;ts how they came to under&s;tand the virtue of this Urin; who an&s;wer'd me, that a certain per&s;on who was contemporary with the fir&s;t Man, having his Arm bruis'd and very black, by rea&s;on of &s;ome accident that befel him through the malice of the Devil, fell a&s;leep in the fields, and as he lay, an Ox &s;taling, a drop of the Urin flew upon his Arm, and pre&s;ently heal'd that part which it wet, and re&s;tor'd it to its former whitene&s;s: which the man perceiving when he wak'd, pre|&s;ently follow'd the Ox, and &s;taid by him 'till he &s;tal'd again, and then receiving the Pi&s;s upon the whole wound, was perfectly cur'd. They al&s;o pre&s;erve it, and compound it with a Water, which they cau&s;e them to drink who have committed any Sin, after they have been at Confe&s;&s;ion for it. They call that Water the <HI>Cazi</HI>'s Water; which Urin ought to be pre&s;erv'd forty days, with an infu&s;i on of Willow-Bark, and certain Herbs. When any per&s;on is confe&s;s'd of his Sin, if it be a crying Sin, the party is bound to &s;tay ten days in the <HI>Cazi</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and not to eat or drink but what the Prie&s;t gives them. And in order ro Ab&s;olution, the Prie&s;t &s;trips him naked, and tyes a little Dog to his right great Toe, which he leads with him about the <HI>Cazi</HI>'s
<PB N="168" REF="100">
Hou&s;e wherever he goes, &s;ometimes a whole day, &s;ometimes longer, according to the hainou&s;ne&s;s of the crime. In that po&s;ture he de&s;ires the <HI>Cazi</HI> to purifie him, telling him that for his part he believes him&s;elf to be purifi'd. The Prie&s;t makes an&s;wer that it is the Dog that mu&s;t purifie him, and not he. After that he powrs the com|pounded water &s;even times upon his head, then gives him a draught to drink, and &s;o he is ab&s;olv'd. This Penitence co&s;ts the criminal Sawce, who is afterwards bound to fea&s;t all his friends at the <HI>Cazi</HI>'s Hou&s;e. Being &s;urpriz'd at this &s;uper&s;tition, I ask'd whether the women were &s;hrifted thus by the <HI>Cazi;</HI> but I found that the <HI>Cazi</HI>'s Wives confe&s;s and ab&s;olve the women and maids.</P>
<P>One more &s;trange cu&s;tom they have, that when a man is upon the point of death, they take a little Dog and &s;et it upon the expiring parties bre&s;t. When he is ju&s;t breathing his la&s;t, they put the mouth of the Dog to the mouth of the per&s;on dying, and cau&s;e him to bark twice in that po&s;ture, that the Soul of the deceas'd may enter into the Dog, who they &s;ay will deliver it into the hands of the Angel appointed to receive it. Moreover when any Dog happ'ns to dye, they carry him out of the City, and pray to God for the Carrion, as if the Bea&s;t receiv'd any kindne&s;s after death by their Prayers.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Bea&s;ts, which they love or hate.</HEAD>
<P>THere are &s;ome Bea&s;ts which the <HI>Gaurs</HI> do mightily re&s;pect, and to which they give a great deal of Honour. There are others which they as much abhor, and which they endeavour'd to de&s;troy as much as in them lies, believing that they were not created by God, but that they came out of the body of the Devil, who&s;e ill nature they retain.</P>
<P>The Bea&s;ts which they principally admire are the Cow, the Oxe, and the Dog. They are expre&s;ly forbid to eat of the fle&s;h of a Cow or an Oxe, or to kill them. The rea&s;on why they &s;o e&s;teem the&s;e Creatures is, becau&s;e the Oxe labours for man, and Ploughs the Ground that produces his food. As for the Cow they more dearly affect her for the Milk &s;he gives, but e&s;pecially for the purifying qua|lity of her Urine.</P>
<P>The Creatures which they abhor are Adders, Serpents, Lizards, Toads, Frogs, Creyfi&s;h, Rats, Mice, but above all the re&s;t Cats; which they &s;ay are the re&s;em|blance of the Devil, who gave them &s;o much &s;trength that a man can hardly kill them; &s;o that they rather &s;uffer the inconveniency of Rats and Mice, than ever to keep a Cat in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>As for the other Animals before-mention'd, if any of the <HI>Gaurs</HI> fall &s;ick, they hire poor people to go and find tho&s;e Creatures out and kill them; which they reck'n in the number of tho&s;e good works that comfort the Souls of the deceas'd. The rea|&s;on why they hate them &s;o, is, becau&s;e they believe the Devils make u&s;e of them to torment the Damn'd; and therefore they do a work of charity that de&s;troy them, whereby they mitigate the pains and torments of Souls in Hell.</P>
<P>The la&s;t King of the&s;e <HI>Gaurs</HI> was <HI>Sha-Ie&s;herd,</HI> who was driv'n out of his Country by <HI>Omar</HI> the &s;econd, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the RELIGION of the <HI>ARMENIANS,</HI> and of their Principal CEREMONIES. CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the <HI>Armenians</HI> Con&s;ecrate and Admini&s;ter the Sacrament.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the <HI>Armenians</HI> Traded into <HI>Europe</HI> and began to be Travellers, their Churches are better &s;et out then they were heretofore. They &s;pare no co&s;t to adorn the Choir and the Altar; you tread upon rich Carpets, and for the &s;tructure and embelli&s;hments of it, they employ the be&s;t Workmen and the choice&s;t Materials they can meet with. From the body of the Church to the Choir there is u&s;ually an a&s;cent of five or &s;ix Steps. Nor is there above one Altar in any Church, upon which they &s;et the Con&s;ecrated Bread, before they &s;et the Chalice where the Wine is. When the Ma&s;s for the Ceremony is &s;aid by an Arch-bi&s;hop, at the rea|ding of the Go&s;pel they light an abundance of Wax Tapers, which Tapers are like Torches. After tbe Go&s;pel is read, &s;everal of the <HI>Noviciates</HI> take &s;ticks in their Hands about five foot long, at the end whereof are Latten Plates with little Bells hanging about them, which when they are &s;hak'd, imitate the &s;ound of Cymbals. Other <HI>Noviciates</HI> there are which hold a Copper Plate in their Hands hung about with Bells, which they &s;trike one again&s;t another: and at the &s;ame time the <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;ticks</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> &s;ing together indifferent Harmoniou&s;ly. All this while the Arch-bi&s;hop has two Bi&s;hops of each &s;ide of him, who are in the room of a Dean and a Sub-dean; and when it is time, he goes and unlocks a Window in the Wall on the Go&s;pel &s;ide, and takes out the Chalice where the Wine is. Then with all his Mu&s;ick he takes a turn about the Altar, upon which he at length &s;ets down the Cha|lice, &s;aying certain Prayers. After that, with the Chalice in his hand, and the Bread upon the Chalice, he turns toward the People, who pre&s;ently pro&s;trate them&s;elves upon the Ground, beat their Bre&s;ts, and ki&s;s the Earth, while the Arch-bi&s;hop pronounces the&s;e words; <HI>This is the Lord who gave his Body and Blood for you.</HI> Then he turns toward the Altar, and eats the Bread dip'd in the Wine; for they never drink the Wine, but only dip the Bread in it. That done, the Arch-bi&s;hop turns once more toward the people with the Bread and Chalice in his hand, and they that will receive, come one after another to the bottom of the Choir, whither it is not lawful for any Lay-per&s;on what&s;oever to a&s;cend; to whom the Arch-bi&s;hop gives the Bread dip'd in Wine that is in the Chalice, which Bread is without leven, flat, and round, about as thick as a Crown, and as big as the Ho&s;t of the Ma&s;s, being Con&s;ecrated the day before by the Prie&s;t, who&s;e Office it is. They never put Water in their Communion-Wine; affirming that Water is for Bap|ti&s;m, and that Chri&s;t when he in&s;tituted the Holy Supper drank it pure, without any mixture of Water.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Armenians</HI> come to the Communion, the Arch-bi&s;hop or the Prie&s;t &s;ays the&s;e words: <HI>I confe&s;s and believe that this is the Body and Blood of the Son of God, who takes away the &s;ins of the World, who is not only ours, but the Salvation of all Mankind.</HI> The Prie&s;t repeats the&s;e words three times to the people, to in&s;truct them and to teach them to what end they receive the Sacrament. Every time the Prie&s;t &s;ays the words, the people &s;ay after him word for word; and when the Prie&s;t &s;erves the people, he breaks the Ho&s;t into little bits which he dips in the Wine, and gives to every one of the Communicants. That which I mo&s;t wonder at is, that they give the Communion to Children of two or three months old, which their Mothers bring in their Arms; though many times, the Children put it out of their mouths again. They never admini&s;ter the Sacrament all the time of their Lent, for then they never &s;ay Ma&s;s but upon <HI>Sunday</HI> noon, which they call Low-Ma&s;s, at which time they never &s;ee the Prie&s;t, who has a Curtain drawn before the Altar, and only reads the Go&s;pel and Creed aloud. Sometimes upon <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> in the Pa&s;&s;ion week
<PB N="170" REF="101">
they &s;ay Low-Ma&s;s about noon, and then they Confe&s;s and admini&s;ter the Sacrament: But generally they &s;tay 'till Saturday, and then the Communicants, after they have receiv'd, are permitted to eat Fi&s;h, Eggs, Butter, Oyl, or any thing el&s;e except Fle&s;h. Upon <HI>Ea&s;ter day,</HI> by break of day, the Prie&s;t &s;ays Low-Ma&s;s, Confe&s;&s;es, and Admini|&s;ters, after which it is lawful to eat Fle&s;h. But the Bea&s;ts mu&s;t be kill'd upon <HI>Ea&s;ter|day,</HI> and not &s;o much as upon <HI>Ea&s;ter-eve.</HI> They have four other Fea&s;ts in the year, wherein they ob&s;erve the &s;ame Ceremony, eating neither Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Eggs, Butter nor Oyl for eight days: which four Fea&s;ts are <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>Annunciation,</HI> and St. <HI>George</HI>'s. Before this la&s;t Fea&s;t they &s;tretch their devotion to the utmo&s;t, for &s;ome will fa&s;t three days, &s;ome five, one after another.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ordination of their Prie&s;thood; and their Au&s;terites.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen a Father de&s;igns his Son to the Prie&s;thood, he carries him to the Prie&s;t, who puts the Cope, op'n on both &s;ides, about his Shoulders; after which the Father and Mother take him home again. This Ceremony is repeated &s;even times in &s;everal years, according to the years of the young Child, 'till he come to be of age to &s;ay Ma&s;s. If he be not de|&s;ign'd for a Monk, but for the Prie&s;thood, after the fourth time of putting on the <HI>Cha&s;uble</HI> or op'n Cope, they marry him; for their Prie&s;ts marry once, but if that Wife dye, if they intend to marry again, they mu&s;t give over &s;aying Ma&s;s. The &s;ix fir&s;t Ceremonies being over, when the Youth comes to the age of 18 years, at what time they are capable of &s;aying Ma&s;s, as well tho&s;e who are de&s;ign'd for Monks, as tho&s;e who are marry'd Prie&s;ts, they proceed to the &s;eventh and la&s;t Ceremony, which mu&s;t be perform'd by an Archbi&s;hop or a Bi&s;hop; who inve&s;ts the young Prie&s;t with all the Habits which the Prie&s;ts wear that &s;ay Ma&s;s. That being done, he goes into the Church, out of which he is not to depart for a whole year; during all which time he is altogether employ'd in the &s;ervice of the Church. The Prie&s;t who is mar|ry'd, mu&s;t be five days after he has &s;aid Ma&s;s before he returns home to eat or drink, or lye with his Wife. And as well the Monks as Prie&s;ts, when they intend to &s;ay Ma&s;s again, mu&s;t remain five days in the Church, without either going to bed or touching any thing with their hands, unle&s;s it be the Spoon where-with they eat their meat: not daring all the while to &s;pit or blow their no&s;es. The next five days after they have &s;aid Ma&s;s, though &s;uch days upon which they might otherwi&s;e eat Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, they are oblig'd to feed upon nothing el&s;e but Eggs without Butter, and Rice boyl'd with Water and Salt. The morning before they celebrate Ma&s;s, if the Prie&s;t have by chance &s;wallow'd a drop of Water, he mu&s;t not &s;ay Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Their Au&s;terities are &s;uch, that many of their Bi&s;hops never eat Fle&s;h or Fi&s;h above four times a year; but more then that, when they come to be Archbi&s;hops, they only live upon Pul&s;e. They have &s;ix months and three days in a year wherein they keep <HI>Lent,</HI> or particular Fa&s;ts, which you plea&s;e to call them; and during all that time, as well the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons as the Laity, feed only upon Bread, and &s;ome few Herbs which grow in their Gardens. There was an <HI>Armenian</HI> of <HI>Zulpha</HI> who&s;e &s;uper|&s;tition was &s;o great, that he made his Hor&s;e to fa&s;t with him, allowing him but very little either to eat or drink for a whole week together. As for the poor labouring people, they only feed upon Pul&s;e, boyl'd in Water and Salt: for during their chief <HI>Lent,</HI> they are permitted no more then others, to eat either Butter or Oyl; nay though they lay a dying, it is not lawful for them to eat Fle&s;h upon tho&s;e days where|in that diet is forbidd'n. They may only eat Wall-nuts or Small-nuts, Almonds or Pi&s;taches, or &s;ome &s;uch other Fruit that affords no Oyl; and they have this farther liberty, to pound them, and put them among their Pul&s;e or their Herbs, and boyl them with Rice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>TIS the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Armenians</HI> to Baptize their Infants upon Sunday; or if they Baptize any upon the week days, it is only in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity when they think they will not live. The Midwife carries that Infant to Church, and holds it in her arms, 'till either the Archbi&s;hop, the Bi&s;hop, or the Prie&s;t has &s;aid &s;ome part of the Form of Bapti&s;m. Then he that baptizes takes the Infant which is naked, and plunges it in the Water, and then taking it out again, puts it into the hands of the God-father, and goes on with the Prayers. While he reads them, with the Cotton which he has in his hand he twi&s;ts a &s;tring about half an Ell long. He makes another al&s;o of red Silk, which is flat; then twi&s;ting tho&s;e two &s;trings together, he puts them about the Child's neck. They &s;ay, that the&s;e two &s;trings, one of white Cotton, and the other of red Silk, &s;ignifies the Blood and Water which flow'd from the Body of CHRIST, when he was wounded with the Lance up|on the Cro&s;s. Having ty'd the cord about the neck of the Child, he takes the holy Oyl and anoints the Child in &s;everal parts of the body, making the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s in every place where he drops the Oyl; every time pronouncing the&s;e words, <HI>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> He fir&s;t anoints the Forehead, then the Chin, then the Stomach, the Arm-holes, the Hands and Feet.</P>
<P>As to the making this Oyl, you mu&s;t know, that every &s;even years, upon the Eve of our <HI>Lady</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> again&s;t which day they ob&s;erve a &s;mall <HI>Lent</HI> of eight days, tke Patriarch makes this holy Oyl; there being no per&s;on but he who has power to make it. He u&s;es all &s;orts of fragrant Flowers, and Aromatical Drugs; but the principal Flower is that which the <HI>Armenians</HI> call in their Language <HI>Bala&s;&s;an-Jagu&eacute;,</HI> we in ours, the <HI>Flower of Paradi&s;e.</HI> When the Oyl is made, the Patriarch &s;ends two Bottles to all the Covents of <HI>A&s;ia, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> without which they cannot baptize.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of Bapti&s;m being over, the God-father goes out of the Church with the Infant in his arms, and a Taper of white Wax in each hand. According to the quality of the per&s;on, when the Child is carry'd out of the Church, the Trumpets, Drums, Hautboys, and other In&s;truments of the Country make a hideous noi&s;e and go before the Infant to the Parents Hou&s;e, where being arriv'd, the God-father delivers the Child to the Mother. She pro&s;trates her &s;elf at the &s;ame time before the God-father, ki&s;&s;ing his feet; and while &s;he continues in that po&s;ture, the God-father ki&s;&s;es her head. Neither the Father nor the God-father names the Child, but he that baptizes gives him the Name of the Saint who&s;e Fe&s;tival falls upon the Sunday on which the Child is baptiz'd. If there be no Saint's day that Sunday in the Almanack, they take the next Name who&s;e Fe&s;tival &s;ucceeds the Sunday of Bapti&s;m; &s;o that they have no affected Names among them. Upon the return of the God-father with the Child home, there is a Fea&s;t prepar'd for all the Kindred and Friends, and him that baptiz'd the Infant, with whom all the Prie&s;ts and Monks of the Covent, at lea&s;t of the Pari&s;h, go along. The poor people were wont to be &s;o prodigal at the&s;e Fea&s;ts, as al&s;o upon their Marriages and Burials, that the next day they had not wherewithal to buy Victuals, much le&s;s to pay what they have borrow'd for &s;o needle&s;s an ex|pence. But now the poor <HI>Armenians</HI> are grown &s;o cunning to avoid the Ba&s;tinado's which are gi'vn to Debtors upon the &s;oles of the Feet, when they cannot pay, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> that they carry the Child to Church upon the week|days: without any Ceremony, with tears in their eyes, pretending it to be &s;ickly and like to dye, and &s;o make no Fea&s;ts at all.</P>
<P>If the Women lye in fifteen or twenty days, or two months before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> they defer the baptizing the Infant 'till the Fe&s;tival, provided the Infant be healthy. Then in all the Cities and Villages where the <HI>Armenians</HI> live, if there be any River or Pond, they make ready two or three flat-bottom'd Boats, &s;pread with Carpets to walk upon, in one of which upon <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> they &s;et up a kind of an Altar. In the morning by Sun-ri&s;ing all the <HI>Armenian</HI> Clergy, as well of that place as of the parts adjoyning, get into the Boats in their Habits, with the Cro&s;s and Banner. Then
<PB N="172" REF="102">
they dip the Cro&s;s in the Water three times, and every time they drop the Holy Oyl upon it. After that they u&s;e the ordinary form of Bapti&s;m, which being done, the Arch-bi&s;hop or the Mini&s;ter plunges the Infant in the River or Pond three times, &s;aying the u&s;ual words, <HI>I Bapti&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. and the &s;ame anointings as before: though it &s;eems a wonder to me that the extremity of the weather does not kill the Child. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is many times pre&s;ent at this ceremony when it is perform'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> riding on Hor&s;e-back to the &s;ide of the River with all his Nobility. The Ceremony being over he goes to <HI>Zulpha</HI> to the <HI>Kelonter</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where there is an entertainment prepar'd for him. Neither is there any place in the World where a King may be entertain'd with le&s;s charge than in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> For if any private per&s;on invite the King, and that His Maje&s;ty plea&s;es to do him that Honour, 'tis but for the inviter to go to the chief of the Officers, and to carry him twenty <HI>Tomans,</HI> or three hundred Crowns, and to tell him withall, that the King has promis'd to accept of a &s;mall Collation with his Slave. For then the Governour is oblig'd to &s;end to the Hou&s;e of him that treats the King all things nece&s;&s;ary for the entertainment. El&s;e it were impo&s;&s;ible to be done, in regard the King eats in nothing but in Gold Plate. At the end of the Fea&s;t the King is always pre&s;ented with &s;ome <HI>European</HI> Rarity, not le&s;s worth than four or five thou&s;and Crowns. Or if the per&s;on have no Rarity to pre&s;ent, it &s;uffices to offer in a Ba&s;on the value in <HI>Venetian Ducats</HI> of Gold, with all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion imaginable. Be&s;ides all this, &s;ome Pre&s;ents mu&s;t be giv'n to &s;ome of the Lords and principal Eunuchs of his train; and others &s;ent to the Queen Mo|ther, if living, and to the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> his Wives and Si&s;ters. Thus though the enter|tainment may be made with little trouble, yet otherwi&s;e it proves &s;omewhat expen|&s;ive; though the <HI>Armenians</HI> of <HI>Zulpha</HI> are well enough able to bear the charge. I was twice at this Ceremony upon <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> day in <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The fir&s;t time I &s;aw <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> and the &s;econd time <HI>Sha-Abas</HI> the &s;econd, who drank both &s;o hard, that in their Drink they committed tho&s;e crimes that very much &s;tain'd their memories: For <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> returning home &s;tab'd his Wife, the Mother of <HI>Sha-Abas&punc; Sha-Abas</HI> ano|ther time returning home in drink, would needs drink on, and force three wo|men to drink with him; who finding he would not give over, &s;tole out of his Com|pany. The King perceiving them gone without taking leave, in a mad humour &s;ent his Eunuchs for them, and caus'd them to be thrown into the Fire, where the poor women were burnt; for there is no re&s;i&s;ting nor examining the Kings com|mand.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Marriages of the <HI>Armenians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Armenians</HI> Marry their Children before either party have &s;een each other, nay before the Fathers or Brothers know any thing of it. And they whom they intend to Marry mu&s;t agree to what their Fathers or Parents command them. When the Mothers have agreed among them|&s;elves, they tell their Husbands, who approve what they have done. Upon this Approbation, the Mother of the Boy, with two old Women and a Prie&s;t come to the Hou&s;e where the Mother of the Daughter lives, and pre&s;ent her a Ring from him whom they intend to betroth. The Boy appears afterwards, and the Prie&s;t reads &s;omething out of the Go&s;pel as a ble&s;&s;ing upon both parties; after which they give him a &s;um of Money according to the quality of the Father of the Girl. That done, they pre&s;ent the company with drink, and this is call'd a betrothing or affi|ancing. Sometimes they agree a Marriage when the Children are not above two or three years old; &s;ometimes two women that are friends being both with Child at one time together, will make a match between the two Children before they are born, if the one be a Boy and the other a Girl. So &s;oon as they are born the Contract is made; and when once the Boy has giv'n the Ring, though it be twenty years after before they are Marry'd, he is bound every year upon <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-day to &s;end his Mi&s;tri&s;s a new Habit with all the trimming belonging to it according to her quality. Three
<PB N="173" REF="102">
days before the Celebration of Marriage, the Father and Mother of the Boy prepare a Fea&s;t, which is carry'd to the hou&s;e of the Father and Mother of the Girl, where the kindred of both parties meet. The Men are in one place by them&s;elves, and the Women in another; for they never eat together at publick Fea&s;ts. The Evening before the Nuptials the Bridegroom &s;ends a Habit to the Bride; and &s;ome time after he comes to receive what the Mother of the Bride has provided for him, on her part. If the Bride has no Mother, &s;ome ancient Woman next a-kin dre&s;&s;es the Bride. At length the Bride gets upon one Hor&s;e, and the Bridegroom upon another, each Hor&s;e being &s;umptuou&s;ly harne&s;s'd, with Bridles and Saddles of Gold and Silver, if the per&s;ons be rich: tho&s;e that are poor, and have not Hor&s;es of their own, repair to the Great men, who willingly lend theirs upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. As they &s;et out from the Virgins habitation, the Bridegroom goes before with a Veil of Carnation-Tiffany upon his Head, or el&s;e of Gold and Silver Net-work, the Me&s;hes whereof are very clo&s;e, that reaches below the Stomach. He holds in his Hand one end of a Girdle &s;ome three or four Ells long, and the Bride that rides behind holds the other. She is al&s;o cover'd with a large white Veil from head to foot, that &s;preads al&s;o a good way over the Hor&s;e. Under which Veil, that rather &s;eems a large white Sheet, the Bride is hid in &s;uch a manner, that there is nothing to be &s;een of her but her Eyes. Two Men walk on either &s;ide of each Hor&s;e; and if they be Children of three or four years old (for &s;o young they marry) there are three or four Men to hold them in the Saddle, according to the quality of their Parents. A great Train of young Men, the kindred and acquaintance of both parties, follow after, &s;ome a hor&s;e-back, &s;ome a-foot, with Tapers in their hands, as if they were going in Proce&s;&s;ion: and be&s;ides all the&s;e, the Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys and other In&s;tru|ments of the Country, all attending to the Church-door. When they are alighted, every one makes way for the Bridegroom and Bride, who advance up to the foot of the Altar, &s;till holding the Girdle in their hands. Then the Bridegroom and the Bride meet, and lean forehead to forehead. Then comes the Prie&s;t, and turning his back to the Altar, lays his Bible upon their Heads, in&s;tead of a Desk, a weight &s;uffi|ciently heavy, as being a thick ponderous Folio. There he lets it lye while he reads the form of Matrimony, which Office is mo&s;t u&s;ually perform'd by a Bi&s;hop or an Archbi&s;hop. The Form is very much like ours. The Bi&s;hop demands the Bride|groom, <HI>Wilt thou have &s;uch a one to thy Wife?</HI> then to the Bride he &s;ays, <HI>Wilt thou have &s;uch a one for thy Husband?</HI> to which they both an&s;wer with a nod of the Head. The Matrimonial Benediction being giv'n, they hear Ma&s;s; which being ended, they return both together to the Daughters habitation, in the &s;ame order as they &s;et out. The&s;e Nuptials la&s;t three days: where the Women drink more than the Men. The Man goes to Bed fir&s;t, the Woman pulling of the man's Breeches, though &s;he does not lay a&s;ide her Veil 'till the Candle be put out. Let it be what time in the year it will, the Woman ri&s;es before day. So that there be &s;ome <HI>Armenians</HI> that in ten years after they are marry'd never &s;aw their Wives faces, nor ever heard them &s;peak. For though her Husband may &s;peak to her, and all the re&s;t of her kindred, yet &s;he never an&s;wers but with a Nod. The Women never eat with their Husbands; but if the Men fea&s;t their Friends to day, the Women fea&s;t theirs the next Day.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the <HI>Armenians</HI> Bury their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>SO &s;oon as any per&s;on dyes, one appointed for the Services of the Dead runs immediately to the Church to fetch a Pot of Holy-Water, which he pre&s;ently pours into a great Ve&s;&s;el full of Water, into which they put the dead Corps. This man is call'd <HI>Mordichou,</HI> or the per&s;on that wa&s;hes the Dead, which <HI>Mordichou's</HI> are &s;o much dete&s;ted among the people, that it is an ignominy to eat or drink with tho&s;e &s;ort of people. Whatever the party deceas'd has about him at the time of his death belongs to them, though it be any excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ewel; for it is the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t to lye in their Breeches, Shirt, and Wa&s;tcoa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, in regard they
<PB N="174" REF="103">
never make u&s;e of Bed cloaths. So &s;oon as the Corps is wa&s;h'd, they dre&s;s it with a clean white Shirt, a pair of Breeches, a Wa&s;tcoat&punc; and a Bonnet, all new, never having been worn before. Then they put the Body in a linnen Sack, and &s;ow up the mouth of it. That being done, the Prie&s;ts come and take up the Body to carry it to Church, which is attended by all the kindred and friends of the deceas'd, with every one a Taper in his hand. Being come to Church, they &s;et down the Corps before the Altar where the Prie&s;t &s;ays certain Prayers; and then &s;etting up lighted Tapers round about the Corps, they leave it &s;o all night. The next day in the morning a Bi&s;hop or an ordinary Prie&s;t &s;ays Ma&s;s, at the end whereof they carry the Body before the door of the Bi&s;hop's hou&s;e, attended as before; at what time the Bi&s;hop comes forth and &s;ays a prayer for the Soul of the deceas'd. Then eight or ten of the poorer &s;ort that are next at hand, carry the Body to the Church-vard. All the way they &s;ing certain Dirges&punc; which the Prie&s;ts continue, while the Body is let down into the Grave. Then the Bi&s;hop takes three handfuls of Earth, and throws them one after another into the Grave, pronouncing the&s;e words; <HI>From Earth thou cam'&s;t, to Earth thou &s;halt return, and &s;tay there 'till our Lord comes.</HI> The&s;e words being &s;aid, they fill up the Grave. Tho&s;e of the kindred and friends that will go back find a Collation ready; and if any other per&s;ons will go along, they are not refus'd. For &s;even days al&s;o they allow Dinners and Suppers to certain Prie&s;ts and poor people, if they are per|&s;ons of ability: believing no Soul departed can be &s;av'd, unle&s;s the &s;urvivors are at that expence. Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;o many of the poor people are &s;o mi&s;erable, and Slaves to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> by borrowing Money to defray tho&s;e expences, which they are not able to pay again.</P>
<P>When an Archbi&s;hop or a Bi&s;hop dyes, they add this farther Ceremony, that an Archbi&s;hop or a Bi&s;hop writes a little Note, and cutting op'n the Sack puts the Note into the Hand of the deceas'd, wherein are the&s;e words; <HI>Remember thy &s;elf, that from Earth thou cam'&s;t, and to Earth thou &s;halt return.</HI></P>
<P>If a Slave dye before enfranchiz'd, when the Body is brought into the Church, the Ma&s;ter writes a Note, wherein are the&s;e words; <HI>Let him not grieve, I make him free, and give him his liberty.</HI> For they believe that he would be reproach'd in the other World for being a Slave, for which his Soul might &s;uffer tribulation. If the Ma&s;ter be dead, the Mi&s;tre&s;s does the &s;ame. If an <HI>Armenian</HI> makes away him&s;elf, they never carry the Body out of the door of the hou&s;e, but make a hole in the wall, where they can mo&s;t conveniently, and carry him to his Grave without any Ceremony.</P>
<P>The night preceding the Fea&s;t of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> Men, Women, and Children go to the Church-yard, whither they carry good &s;tore of Food, not forgetting their Wine. Immediately they fall a weeping over the Graves of the dead, and after they have &s;pent &s;ome time in that doleful Exerci&s;e, they all fall to eating and drink|ing; thus pa&s;&s;ing the whole night by turns, in blub'ring, eating, and bubbing.</P>
<P>As for the poor people, they would think them&s;elves undone, and the mo&s;t unfortunate in the world, &s;hould they want Provi&s;ion and Wine to go to the Church-yards, the night before the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George,</HI> where they go to frolick it, rather then to pray for the Dead.</P>
<P>There may be &s;ome few <HI>Armenians</HI> that embrace <HI>Mahometani&s;m</HI> for worldly Intere&s;t, but they are generally the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate per&s;ons in the world, and mo&s;t firm to their &s;uper&s;titious Principles.</P>

<P>IT is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> that when any one of them apo&s;tatizes, and de&s;ires to return again to the Church, he cannot have Ab&s;olution but at the &s;ame City or Village where he fir&s;t abjur'd his Religion.</P>
<P>Now it happen'd that a young <HI>Armenian</HI> being &s;ent to <HI>Smyrna</HI> with a very con&s;iderable quantity of Goods, and falling to debauchery, turn'd <HI>Mahometan,</HI> to

the end he might defraud his Father and his Brethren of their E&s;tate, according to <HI>Haly</HI>'s Law, already mention'd. But after he had &s;pent good part of the Goods in Debauchery, he return'd to the <HI>Three Churches,</HI> where the Grand Patriarch liv'd, to be ab&s;olv'd from his Fault; but the Patriarch telling him he mu&s;t go to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> he went accordingly; and in &s;ome few days after he had under|gone the Penance enjoyn'd him, he went to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and with a great Re&s;olution, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you know that &s;ome years &s;ince I turn'd</HI> Mahometan; <HI>now I come to declare before ye that I have repented, and do repent of the foul Crime I committed, when I deny'd the Saviour of the World, and embrac'd your wicked Law.</HI> The <HI>Cadi,</HI> who thought it had been at fir&s;t only &s;ome evaporation of Extravagance, endeavour'd to reclaim him by fair words and promi&s;es; but when he heard him per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution, when he heard him cur&s;e and bla&s;pheme <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he caus'd him to be carry'd to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where he was cut to pieces immediately. For no per&s;ons go with more courage and joy to &s;uffer for their Faith, then the <HI>Armenians.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1651 there happen'd to be a Wedding between a young <HI>Turk</HI> and a Virgin of the &s;ame Nation. To this Wedding was invited an <HI>Armenian</HI> Lady, who was a great friend of the Bridegroom's Mother. The <HI>Armenian</HI> had an only Son of about twelve years of age, that earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to go along with her; at fir&s;t &s;he refus'd him, knowing that after the age of five or &s;ix years, no Youth is permitted to be in company with the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women or Maids. But the Boy &s;till pre&s;&s;ing his Mother, and being &s;econded by an Aunt, who to plea&s;e her Nephew, told her &s;he might let him go in Girls Apparel; at la&s;t the indulgent Mother, over-rul'd by the importunity of the Child, took him along with her in a female dre&s;s. Three days the &s;olemnity of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Weddings la&s;t: but the very fir&s;t day, an old <HI>Gip&s;y-Turk</HI> ca&s;ting her Eye upon the young <HI>Armenian,</HI> and finding him too &s;parki&s;h and too nimble for a Girl, &s;u&s;pected his Sex; and calling his Mother a&s;ide, told her, that by all the ge&s;tures and actions of the Child, &s;he could be no Girl, but a Boy in di&s;|gui&s;e. The Mother not only deny'd the matter, but al&s;o &s;eem'd highly offended at the old Womans &s;u&s;pition; who as much incens'd to have her judgment que|&s;tion'd, decoy'd the Child among the Eunuchs of the Family, and caus'd him to be &s;earch'd; and finding her&s;elf in the right, &s;pred it pre&s;ently about the hou&s;e. Im|mediately the people cry'd that the Chambers were defil'd, that the <HI>Armenian</HI> Lady had done it in deri&s;ion of their Law; and &s;eizing Mother, Aunt, and Youth, carry'd them all before the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> demanding Ju&s;tice. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd the Mother and the Aunt, but kept the Youth &s;ix or &s;ev'n days, hoping the rage of the people would be over. But in vain he &s;trove to plead for the Child, though the Father offer'd them half the weight of him in Gold, for the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was forc'd to deliver him up into the hands of the marry'd Womans kindred; who carry'd the Child to the Market-place of the City, where they &s;tript him &s;tark naked; and fir&s;t they flea'd him from his Neck behind down to the Wa&s;t, and &s;o left him with a Guard upon him all night. The <HI>Cadi</HI> and <HI>Moullah's</HI> exhorted the Child to turn <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and they would pre&s;erve him from further mi&s;chief. His Mother beg'd him to have pity upon her and him&s;elf, and to turn <HI>Mahometan</HI> to &s;ave his life. But neither tears, nor all the tender words that grief and affection could in&s;pire, could &s;hake the con|&s;tancy of the Infant, who with a re&s;olute utterance an&s;wer'd, that he had hitherto &s;uffer'd, and &s;till would &s;uffer patiently; and that nothing griev'd him, but that his Mother &s;hould exhort him to deny his Saviour. Next day the pitile&s;s <HI>Turks</HI> came and flea'd all his Brea&s;t and his Stomach, and &s;o left him all night under a Guard, intending to have flea'd him part by part every day. But the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> abhorring their Cruelty, came the next day with his Guards, and caus'd his Head to be cut off.</P>
<P><HI>Van</HI> is a City peopl'd as well with <HI>Armenians</HI> as <HI>Turks;</HI> &s;o that it is a u&s;ual thing for the <HI>Armenian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Boys to play together. One day it unfortu|nately fell out, that the Boys playing one among another, and flinging Stones at each other, an <HI>Armenian</HI> Boy hit a young <HI>Turk</HI> full upon the Temples, and &s;trook him dead. Pre&s;ently the other <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Boys and the Rabble &s;eiz'd him, and carry'd him to the <HI>Ba&s;ha;</HI> the Father and Mother of the Child &s;lain follow'd with hideous out|crys, bawling for ju&s;tice, or that the Boy &s;hould turn <HI>Mahometan</HI> to expiate his fault. The <HI>Armenian</HI> Parents offer'd a large &s;um of Money to redeem their Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d; but the adver&s;e party ob&s;tinate again&s;t all accommodation, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was con&s;train'd
<PB N="169" REF="104">
to deliver the Child, giving &s;entence that the young <HI>Armenian</HI> &s;hould endure the &s;ame death the <HI>Turk</HI> had &s;uffer'd, and no other. Immediately the <HI>Turks</HI> hurry'd the poor Child to the place where he had unfortunately &s;lain his play-fellow; and after the Parents of the young <HI>Turk</HI> had had the two fir&s;t hits, he was pre&s;ently brain'd by a &s;how'r of Stones from the Rabble. Yet as near death as he knew him&s;elf to be, without any di&s;turbance at all, he exhorted his weeping play-fellows to &s;tand firm to the Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for which he was going to dye.</P>
<P>Another time an <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant coming from the <HI>Indies</HI> to Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> went to the Coffee-hou&s;e according to cu&s;tom, being a rendezvous of all the Mer|chants in the Town. There falling into di&s;cour&s;e, by rea&s;on of the heat of the weather, he took off his Bonnet made after the <HI>Armenian</HI> fa&s;hion of divers Colours, and laid it behind him, keeping his black Cap only upon his head. When the <HI>Moullah</HI> came about to ha&s;ten the people to go away according to the cu&s;tom, which I have already declar'd, the <HI>Armenian</HI> ha&s;tily ri&s;ing up, a <HI>Turk,</HI> concealing the Merchant's Bonnet, clap'd his own Bonnet upon his head. Upon that all the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Merchants that were there came and congratulated the <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant, telling him, how glad they were to &s;ee that he had embrac'd the good Law. At which words the <HI>Armenian</HI> &s;urpriz'd, takes off the Turbant, throws it to the Ground before all the Company, and &s;tamp'd it under foot. This action of contempt &s;o enrag'd the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they carry'd him before the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> before whom it was in vain to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf, or to affirm that the Turbant was malitiou&s;ly put upon his head; for the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;wore the contrary, and that he took it of his own accord, and therefore he mu&s;t either turn <HI>Turk</HI> or dye for it. Upon his refu&s;al they put him in Pri&s;on, and in a few days the &s;entence was brought him from the <HI>Mufii</HI> and <HI>Cadi,</HI> that he mu&s;t either turn or be burnt alive. The &s;everity of the &s;entence overpowr'd him at fir&s;t to embrace the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law. But four or five years after returning from the <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> he came where the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> was &s;itting in Council with the Grandees of the Country, and getting as near the <HI>Mufti</HI> as he could, and throwing his Turbant in his face; <HI>There Dog,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Thou wert the cau&s;e that I have worn it &s;o long, of which I have repen|ted, and do repent from the bottom of my heart; for I know that neither thou nor thy Law are worth a Straw.</HI> At the &s;ame time the croud laid hold of him, and drag'd him to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where he dy'd in the mid&s;t of the flames with an admirable con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>A rich Merchant of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> call'd <HI>Cotgia Soultenon,</HI> was &s;o well belov'd by <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> that he often went to Dine at his hou&s;e. But one day it fell out that the King having eat and drank to exce&s;s, upon his return home fell crop-&s;ick, upon which the report ran that the <HI>Armenian</HI> had poy&s;on'd him. Which report coming to his ears, fearing left the King &s;hould dye, and him&s;elf be put to cruel Torments, he took a do&s;e of Poy&s;on and dy'd. Which when the King, who was well again the next day, under&s;tood, he was very much troubl'd for his death.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Cotiga Soultenon</HI> had a <HI>Cafer</HI> &s;ent him from <HI>Melinda</HI> for a Slave; who being young and very apprehen&s;ive, &s;oon learnt the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Languages, and was in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and Chri&s;ten'd by the name of <HI>Huzod</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> After his Ma&s;ter's death he turn'd <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and &s;o continu'd twenty years. At the end whereof returning to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> he beg'd pardon of the Church; and all the re&s;t of his days &s;o crucify'd him&s;elf with Fa&s;ting, that every one pitty'd him; and when the <HI>Armenian</HI> Bi&s;hops told him he had done well, he made no other an&s;wer, but that he was not worthy to live upon the Earth who had deny'd his Saviour, only he hop'd that he would have mercy upon him; and &s;o continu'd his au&s;tere penance 'till he dy'd.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Author's reception at the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in his &s;ixth and la&s;t Voyage, and what he did there during his &s;tay at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1664. So &s;oon as the <HI>Nazar</HI> was inform'd of my arrival, he &s;ent the <HI>Kelonter</HI> or chief of the <HI>Armenians</HI> with &s;even or eight more to congratulate my arrival, and to a&s;&s;ure me of all the kind Offices he could do me. The next day he &s;ent the &s;ame <HI>Armenians</HI> with four Hor&s;es; and to tell me that the King had a de&s;ire to &s;ee what I had brought; for which purpo&s;e the <HI>Kelonter</HI> had order to furni&s;h me with men. Thereupon I took Hor&s;e, accompany'd by all the <HI>Franks</HI> that were at <HI>Zulpha.</HI> When I came to Court, I was brought into the place where all the great Amba&s;&s;adours had audience, where I found attending the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> &s;uperior of the order of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> ready to deliver me my Box of Jewels which I had left with him in the Covent for more &s;ecurity. After I had expos'd my Goods upon a fair Table cover'd with a Carpet of Gold and Silver, and that the <HI>Nazar</HI> had di&s;pos'd every thing in order with his own hand, the King enter'd, attended only by three Eunuchs for his Guard, and two old men, who&s;e office it was to pull off his Shoes when he goes into any Room &s;pread with Gold and Silk Carpets, and to put them on again when he goes forth. The King had nothing on but a &s;ingle pair of Drawers of Taffata, chequer'd red and white, which came half way the Leg, his feet being bare; a &s;hort Ca&s;&s;ock that came but half way his body, with a large Cloak of Cloth of Gold with hanging-&s;leeves down to the Ground, furr'd with Sable Martin. The fir&s;t thing I &s;hew'd was a large Candle&s;tick of Chry&s;tal of the Rock, the riche&s;t piece of that nature that ever was &s;een. The next was a &s;uit of Tape&s;try hangings held up by &s;everal men, as I had appointed. The <HI>Nazar</HI> then caus'd me to advance and do my obey&s;ance to the King, who pre&s;ently knowing my Face again; <HI>Oh,</HI> &s;aid he to the <HI>Nazar, This is the</HI> Fringui Aga <HI>who &s;old me &s;o many Rarities about &s;ix years ago, when</HI> Mahomet Beg <HI>was Athemadoulet.</HI> After that the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;hew'd him all my Rarities as they lay in order. Among the re&s;t I be&s;ought His Maje&s;ty by Frier <HI>Raphael,</HI> to accept of a great Steel Mirror, which when he look'd in, he wonder'd to &s;ee his Face &s;o big. But when Frier <HI>Raphael</HI> had told him the nature of it, he caus'd it to be held to one of his Eunuchs, which had a mon&s;trous Hawk No&s;e, the &s;ight whereof held him in laughter and diverti&s;ement for above a quarter of an hour. After that the King retir'd, leaving me alone with the <HI>Nazar&punc;</HI> and Friar <HI>Raphael.</HI> As for my Jewels I put them up my &s;elf, and had a place a&s;&s;ign'd me to Lock them up and keep the Key, but for my large pieces of Gold&s;miths work, the <HI>Nazar</HI> committed them to the tru&s;t of one of the principal Officers of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day early in the morning the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent for me and Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and made his Secretary write down the price of every thing, according to his de|mands. He had al&s;o his own Arti&s;ts to prize them; but that I did not value, in regard I knew the price much better then they. After he had &s;hew'd the Jewels, price and all to the King, we were &s;everal times before we could agree; but at length he told me, that the King would give me Twenty-five in the Hundred profit for all the Stones; leaving me the Pearls, which he thought I might put off at a better price in the <HI>Indies;</HI> which was an offer I could not refu&s;e, and therefore I &s;ign'd the Agreement according to the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s de&s;ire: Which when his Maje&s;ty had &s;een, he bid the <HI>Nazar</HI> tell me I &s;hould be his Jeweller in Ordinary, and that for my &s;ake all the <HI>Franks</HI> &s;hould be the better us'd within his Territories, and that I &s;hould have any favour of him that&punc; I de&s;ir'd. I be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to give me his Patent with his Seal affix'd, whereby I might be priviledg'd to Trade in his Dominions, without paying Cu&s;tom for &s;uch and &s;uch Merchandize, and in &s;uch manner as I &s;hould think fitting. I al&s;o be&s;ought him graciou&s;ly to grant his Protection to a Nephew of mine, whom I had left at <HI>Tauris</HI> to learn the Lan|guage, that he might be &s;erviceable to his Maje&s;ty when I was dead and gone.
<PB N="178" REF="105">
Thereupon he caus'd my Nephew to be enrol'd pre&s;ently as one of his Dome&s;tick Servants&punc; and order'd the <HI>Nazar</HI> to take particular care of him.</P>
<P>The next day after my agreement with the <HI>Nazar,</HI> the King gave audience in the great Hall of the Palace to the Amba&s;&s;ador of the <HI>&V;sbeck-Tartars.</HI> All the Lords and Officers of the Crown &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ood in the Court where the Amba&s;&s;ador was to pa&s;s: there were al&s;o nine &s;tately Hor&s;es, who&s;e Furniture was very rich, and all different. Two Harne&s;&s;es were cover'd with Diamonds, two with Rubies, two with Emralds, two with Turquoi&s;es, and one embroider'd with fair Pearls. Had he been an Amba&s;&s;ador from a Monarch for whom the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had had a greater e&s;teem than he had for the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> there had been thirty Hor&s;es: for according to the value which the King puts upon the Prince that &s;ends to him, he either augments or abates of the number of his Hor&s;es of State. Every Hor&s;e is ty'd by the Reins to a Nail of Gold fa&s;ten'd in the Ground, with a Hammer of Gold lying by. There was another Nail of Gold behind, with a Cord ty'd to it, that held their hinder legs. They &s;et al&s;o before every Hor&s;e a Caldron of Gold, out of which they draw up Water into a gr&eacute;at Manger; though all this be only for State, for they never water their Hor&s;es in that place.</P>
<P>Out of the fir&s;t Court the Amba&s;&s;ador enter'd into a large Gallery, between a long File of Mu&s;queteers on each &s;ide. Thence he enter'd into a Garden through an Alley about eight Fathom broad, all pav'd with great Marble Stones, in the middle of which runs a Channel of Water four Foot wide, with &s;everal Water-works that &s;purted out of the Channel at equal di&s;tances. On each &s;ide of the Walk to the Hall where the King &s;at, there is a Pond almo&s;t as long as the Walk, and in the middle of the Pond another &s;ort of Water-works. Several Offi|cers of the Army were rang'd all along the Alley; and at the end of one of the Ponds were four Lions ty'd; and at the end of the other, three Tigers couchant upon Carpets of Silk, having Men to guard them with Half-pikes in their hands. The Hall took up more ground in length then in bredth, being op'n every way; the Cieling was &s;u&s;tain'd by &s;ixteen wooden Pillars, of eight pannels every one, and of a prodigious thickne&s;s and height. As well the Cieling as the Pillars were all painted with Foliage-work in Gold and Azure, with certain other Colours mix'd therewith. In the middle of the Hall was a Va&s;e of excellent Marble, with a Fountain throwing out Water after &s;everal manners. The Floor was &s;pread with Gold and Silk Carpets, made on purpo&s;e for the Place: and near to the Va&s;e was a low Scaffold one Foot high, twelve Foot long, and eight wide, cover'd with a magnificent Carpet. Upon this Scaffold &s;ate the King upon a four-&s;quare Cu&s;hion of Cloth of Gold, with another Cu&s;hion behind him cover'd with the &s;ame, &s;et up again&s;t a great Tap'&s;try-Hanging, wrought with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Characters, containing the My&s;teries of the Law. On each &s;ide of the King &s;tood &s;everal Eunuchs with Mu&s;quets in their hands. The King commanded the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> and four others to &s;it down by him, and the <HI>Athemadulet</HI> made me a &s;ign to &s;it down; but the King knowing how little the <HI>Franks</HI> care for &s;itting cro&s;s-leg'd, order'd me to be told that I might &s;tand upright, if I thought good. The King was clad in a Silk &s;treak'd with Gold: His Cloak was a Gold-ground with Flower of Silk and Silver, Furr'd with a Martin Sable, the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t gli&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'ring that ever was &s;een. His Girdle was very rich, and upon his Bonnet he wore a Plume of He|rons Feathers fa&s;ten'd with a tran&s;parent Jewel; in the middle of the Jewel was a Pear-fa&s;hion'd Pearl, &s;et with great Topaze's and Rubies.</P>
<P>About half and hour after the King was &s;at, the <HI>Nazar</HI> and the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies brought the Amba&s;&s;ador, who neither him&s;elf nor any of his Train were very well clad, and caus'd him to &s;tay at the foot of the &s;teps into the Hall from the Garden. When the Amba&s;&s;ador had a&s;cended the &s;teps, he pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore the King, then advancing nine or ten paces he did the &s;ame again; after which the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies caus'd him to &s;it down, leaving between him and the King &s;pace enough for eight men. After that I ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Nazar</HI> went often between the King and the Amba&s;&s;ador, and between the Amba&s;&s;adour and the King; but I could not tell what they &s;aid. So that I being by that time quite tyr'd, made my obey&s;ance to the King, and went home to my Lodging.</P>
<P>The next day the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ignify'd to me that it was the King's plea&s;ure to favour me with a compleat <HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at,</HI> or Habit of Honour; and to pay me my money.</P>

For both in <HI>Turkie</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Receiver of the King's Pre&s;ent is oblig'd to pay the Me&s;&s;enger, in &s;o much that &s;ometimes they hardly &s;cape for a thou&s;and <HI>Tomans.</HI> But when the <HI>Calaat</HI> is &s;ent to any private per&s;on, the <HI>Nazar</HI> choo&s;es out of his Dome&s;tick Servants one to carry it. I gave twenty-five <HI>Tomans</HI> into Father <HI>Raphael</HI>'s hand, who order'd his bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;o good a grace, and &s;o advantageou&s;ly for my Pur&s;e, that he complemented away the Me&s;&s;enger very well &s;atisfi'd with half.</P>
<P>The next day the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent to me to put on my <HI>Calaat,</HI> and to come and do my obey&s;ance to the King, who was that day to go abroad. Thereupon I &s;ummon'd together all the <HI>Franks,</HI> and order'd the Trumpets and Drums to be made ready as I rode from the Palace home. For then the people come out to &s;ee who the King has honour'd that day, who is always known by his Habit, which is &s;till the newe&s;t and gaye&s;t of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that the King being indi&s;pos'd did not go away that day; however I apply'd my &s;elf to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and told him how much I was oblig'd to the King for the honour he had done me, and that I was re&s;olv'd to &s;hew my &s;elf before the greate&s;t Monarchs in <HI>Europe</HI> in the Habit he had be&s;tow'd upon me; that they might behold the beauty and richne&s;s of my <HI>Calaat.</HI> The <HI>Nazar</HI> fail'd not to repeat my Compliment to his Maje&s;ty; who thereupon order'd me the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Cloak, with hanging-&s;leeves, and fac'd with &s;able Martins.</P>
<P>Two or three days after the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent for me again to Court, whither I went, accompany'd by the <HI>Zulp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ian Franks,</HI> as before. I was no &s;ooner come to the Palace, but the <HI>Nazar</HI> met me in the great Hall, attended by two Officers, who carry'd the Cloak which the King had appointed for me, and pre&s;ently taking the Cloak out of their hands, he put it about my &s;houlders, &s;aying the&s;e words, <HI>It is the King's plea&s;ure to honour thee entirely.</HI> It was a mo&s;t magnificent piece of Silk, and very richly furr'd, having been valu'd at eight hundred Crowns. In this I was particularly beholding to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who might have &s;ent me my Cloak home to my Lodging as well as the <HI>Calaat;</HI> but he was pleas'd to put it upon my back in the Palace with his own hands, to &s;pare me the charges of a new Pre&s;ent. After this the <HI>Nazar</HI> took me by the hand, and led me to the Hall, where the King was &s;itting upon a
<PB N="181" REF="107">
large Cu&s;hion, having no more than twelve Eunuchs for his Guard; &s;ome with Bows and Arrows, and &s;ome with Mu&s;quets. By that time I had advanc'd two or three paces in the Hall, the <HI>Nazar</HI> order'd me to fall upon my knees, and touch the Ground with my forehead; then taking me by the hand, he led me within two or three paces of the place where the King was &s;itting, where I was order'd to make the &s;ame obei&s;ance as before; after that he caus'd me to retire &s;even or eight paces, and there to &s;tand. And then it was that His Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to tell me, that he had contriv'd the Models of &s;everal pieces, which he would have made in <HI>France;</HI> and ask'd me whether I would carry them along with me, or whether I would pre&s;ently &s;end them into <HI>France</HI> to be made up while I di&s;patch'd my bu&s;ine&s;s in the <HI>Indies?</HI> I told His Maje&s;ty, that &s;o &s;oon as he would be pleas'd to deliver them to me, I would &s;end them for <HI>France.</HI> After this and &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e I made my obei|&s;ance, and retir'd toward the door of the Hall. Having thus done my duty to the King, I went and ki&s;s'd the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s hand; and then taking Hor&s;e at the Palace-Gate, with the re&s;t of the <HI>Franks</HI> that accompany'd me, we rode home with the Trumpets and Drums of the Country before us. When we came to <HI>Zulpha&punc;</HI> with our Torches before us, for it was three hours after Sun-&s;et, the Men and old Women came out of their Hou&s;es to &s;ee us pa&s;s along, and &s;everall pre&s;ented us with Fruits, Sweet-meats, and Wine, obliging us to drink almo&s;t at every Hou&s;e 'till we got home.</P>

<P>ABout two days after betimes in the Morning I was &s;ent for to the Court in that ha&s;t, that I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">arce time to make me ready. When I came to Court, I found the <HI>Nazar,</HI> Father <HI>Raphel,</HI> and two <HI>Hollanders,</HI> upon whom the <HI>Nazar</HI> had began to ca&s;t a particular eye of favour all together. After we had &s;tay'd a while, the <HI>Nazar</HI> brought us to the Room where the King was, &s;itting upon a low Pallet, with two Mattre&s;&s;es cover'd with a rich Carpet. He lean'd his back again&s;t a large Cu&s;hion four foot long, having before him eight or ten Plates of Fruits and Sweet-meats. Before him al&s;o &s;tood two Bottles, with long round necks of Venice Cry&s;tal &s;top'd with Pitch, full of <HI>Schiras</HI> Wine, with a Cup of pure Gold; upon one &s;ide a kind of a very &s;mall Fat and with a handle, within three or four Fingers &s;ull of the &s;ame Wine, with a Gold Ladle that held a good <HI>Chopine</HI> of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Bottles were for the King's drinking; that in the Fat for tho&s;e that the King did the Honour to drink with him. After we came in and had made our &s;everal obey&s;ances; &s;aid the King to Father <HI>Raphael, Raphael, bia, bia,</HI> that is, <HI>come bither, come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ither,</HI> who thereupon ri&s;ing, and falling upon his knees when he came near the King; <HI>Raphael,</HI> continu'd the King, <HI>if thou wilt drink Wine, &s;tay here, if not, be gone.</HI> The Fryar unaccu&s;tom'd to drink Wine, reply'd that &s;ince His Maje&s;ty did him &s;o great an Honour, he was willing to drink a little. <HI>'Tis very well,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King &s;miling, <HI>go then and take thy &s;eat.</HI> Thereupon the King commanded one of the <HI>Dutch-men</HI> to fill &s;ome Wine, which he did, but with a trembling hand Heav'n, knows, as never having been at &s;uch a Fe&s;tival before. And I ob&s;erv'd that having laid his Hat upon the Carpet, the King commanded him to put it on, it being a very ignominious thing in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to be bare-headed. Thus the great Ladle went about very &s;martly, con&s;idering it was but early in the Forenoon: But at length the King bethinking him&s;elf that the <HI>Franks</HI> were not u&s;ed to drink without eating, gave &s;uch order, that immediately they &s;pread before us a <HI>Sofra</HI> of Cloth of Gold in&s;tad of a Table-Cloth; and over that a Leather Covering of the &s;ame length and breadth, and over that a &s;ort of Bread as long as the <HI>Sofra;</HI> for had the <HI>Sofra</HI> been ten Ells long, the Bread mu&s;t have been as long. This Bread is no thicker then a piece of Paper, and folds like a Napkin. It is made with a
<PB N="182" REF="108">
Rolling-pin, and bak'd upon Plates of T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">n'd Copper. This Bread is nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r eat'n, but only &s;erves for a Table-Cloth to pre&s;erve what falls from the Di&s;hes, and what&punc; every man leaves particularly upon his own Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, which is all wrap'd up in the Lea|ther and giv'n to the poor. Next to that they &s;et upon one end of the <HI>Sofra</HI> a &s;ort of mo&s;t excellent Bread two foot long and one broad, then which never was better eat'n in the World. By and by follow'd Boyl'd and Roa&s;t fle&s;h and fi&s;h, with two Che&s;ts of Limons of <HI>Mazandran,</HI> and Granates from <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>After we had made a large Breakfa&s;t, the King was pleas'd to put me upon a di&s;|cour&s;e of my Travels into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and ask'd me what Princes I had had acce&s;s to, and how many I knew by their faces? Then cau&s;ing a Satchel to be brought him, he open'd it him&s;elf, and &s;hew'd me &s;everal portraitures in Miniature. Pre&s;ently I knew <HI>Sha-Gehan, Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> and three of his Sons; the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour; Sha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> and two <HI>Raja's.</HI> Among the re&s;t he &s;hew'd me a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lady's Picture and gave it me; to the end, &s;aid he, that your <HI>French</HI> Ladies may &s;ee how our <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ladies are clad. After that he &s;hew'd me the Pictures of two <HI>Venetian</HI> Curti&s;ans, the one a Widow, and the other a Virgin, with a Parrot upon her hand clad after the <HI>French</HI> mode. Upon which the King putting the que&s;tion to me which I lik'd be&s;t? I reply'd that &s;he pleas'd me be&s;t who had the Parrot upon her fi&s;t. And why not the other, &s;aid the King? Becau&s;e, an&s;wer'd I, &s;he looks like one that had renounc'd the world. Thereupon the King falling into a laughter, and turning toward Father <HI>Raphael; Patri, Patri,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a Lady as this &s;hould have renounc'd the World?</HI> This led us into a di&s;cour&s;e of beauty, wherein when the King demanded my opinion, I told him that Womens beauty depended very much upon the Cu&s;tom of the Country; for that in <HI>Japan</HI> Women with broad faces were mo&s;t in reque&s;t; in <HI>China</HI> &s;mall feet were admir'd; in the I&s;les of <HI>Borneo</HI> and <HI>Achen,</HI> Women the blacker their Teeth were, the more they were belov'd; that in the I&s;land of <HI>Maca&s;&s;er,</HI> to make their Women lovely, they pull out four of their Teeth when they are young, to put in four of Gold in their room; as I have &s;een a Captain of <HI>Java,</HI> who pull'd out four of his fore Teeth, and &s;et four Diamonds in their place. In &s;hort, I told his Maje&s;ty that in his own Dominions full Eye-brows which meet together were highly e&s;teem'd; whereas the Women of <HI>France</HI> pull them up by the Roots. But which, &s;aid the King, do&s;t thou like be&s;t, the black or the fair? Sir, continu'd I, were I to buy Women as I purcha&s;e Diamonds, Pearls, and Bread, I would always choo&s;e the white&s;t. With that the King fell alaughing, and order'd me a brimmer in his own Cup, which was a great Honour indeed. From hence we fell into a more &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;peaking very low, and the re&s;t of the Com|pany retiring all the while out of hearing. Only I ob&s;erv'd that there was one Lord middle ag'd, and clad after the <HI>Georgian</HI> mode, who &s;tood within five or &s;ix paces behind the King, and that many times as the King drank, he only wet his Lips, and gave the re&s;t to that Lord to drink, which when he had done, he reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d again to his place. Upon inquiry I found he was the King's Uncle by the Mothers &s;ide.</P>
<P>While we were talking of &s;erious things the Curti&s;ans were bid to retire out of the Hall, which they did, into a Gallery that look'd upon a Garden, where they &s;ate, where immediately a <HI>Sofra</HI> was laid before them cover'd w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th Fruits and Sweet|meats, and one of their Society continually powr'd out the Wine which they drank round without intermi&s;&s;ion: One would have thought they &s;hould have been fuddl'd; yet when they came in again, no man could perceive they had been drinking. After they had Danc'd a while, they were order'd to retire again, and the King &s;ent for his Mu&s;ick, which was both Vocal and In&s;trumental; his In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick con&s;i&s;ted of a kind of a Lute, a Guittar, a Spinet, and two or three Ba&s;e Flutes. He had al&s;o in the Gallery where the Curti&s;ans were, a large Ebony Cabi|net eight foot high, adorn'd with &s;everal Silver figures, which prov'd to be an Organ that went alone. It was part of the pre&s;ent which the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors made the King, which he order'd to be &s;et a going, that we might hear it as we &s;ate. No &s;ooner had the Organ &s;top'd, but the Curte&s;ans were call'd in again, and the King caus'd the Gold Ladle to go round, commanding that no man &s;hould leave a drop. When every man had done, the King was pleas'd to ask me which of the Curti&s;an's I thought to be hand&s;ome&s;t? Thereupon I ro&s;e up, and taking a
<PB N="183" REF="108">
Wax&punc;Candle in my hand, I went and view'd them all. The King laugh'd, and being very glad to &s;ee my face among theirs, <HI>Bring hither,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>her to whom thou ha&s;t mo&s;t a fancy.</HI> In obedience to which, I pick'd out the elde&s;t, as I thought, and led her to his Maje&s;ty, who caus'd us to &s;it down by him. Then the King pointing to another, <HI>And why,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>did you not choo&s;e yonder Girl, which is younger and hand&s;omer;</HI> commanding them both to ki&s;s me one after another, that I might under&s;tand the difference between the Care&s;&s;es of one and the other. But I reply'd, that were I to choo&s;e again, I would make the &s;ame choice, be|lieving prudence to accompany age. However I be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider, that it was not for me to look upon elder or younger&punc; and that though he had giv'n me the liberty to &s;end the elder home to my Lodging, yet it was not in my pow'r to accept of his favour, in regard I had a Wife, to whom I never had been unfaithful.</P>
<P>We had thus droll'd together 'till eleven a Clock at night&punc; when the King &s;tarted another Que&s;tion, Whether any one pre&s;ent knew how to Sing? It hap|pen'd that there was one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Daulier</HI> there, that Play'd upon the Virginals, and pretended to Sing, who immediately began a Court-Air. But his Voice being a high-pitch'd Voice, and for that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are altogether for Ba&s;es, the King did not like him. When I &punc;perceiv'd that, being in a merry vein, though I knew not a Note, yet having a good deep voice, and clear, I &s;ung an old Air that came into my head, which begins,</P>
<LG>
<L>Fill all the Bowls then, fiill 'em high,</L>
<L>Fill all the Gla&s;&s;es there, for why</L>
<L>Should every Creature drink but I?</L>
</LG>
<P>The King was &s;o pleas'd, that he cry'd out, <HI>Baricala, Baricala,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Oh the works of God!</HI> an expre&s;&s;ion of admiration u&s;ual among the <HI>Per|&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>By this time it was very late, and the King growing &s;leepy, gave us leave to de|part; which we did very willingly, having had hard labour for &s;eventeen hours together.</P>
<P>The next night the King fell a drinking again, and there was in his pre&s;ence an <HI>Agi</HI> or Pilgrim newly return'd from <HI>Mecca,</HI> and con&s;equently oblig'd never to drink Wine after that. While the <HI>Agi</HI> &s;taid, there was one of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lords got &s;o impertinently fuddl'd, that he twice &s;tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k the <HI>Agi</HI>'s Turbant from his head, refus'd to drink when the King commanded him, play'd the fool with the Curti|&s;ans when they were dancing, and committed &s;o many other acts of folly, that the King incens'd at &s;uch a continuation of Buffonry, in a great fury, <HI>This Ra&s;cal,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>has lo&s;t all his re&s;pect, and thinks he is no more my Slave; drag him out by the feet, and throw him to the Dogs to eat.</HI> Immediately four or five of the King's Officers came and drag'd him out of the Hall by the feet, and every body wonder'd he was not thrown to the Dogs, according to the King's Command; but 'tis thought that &s;ome of the King's Woman beg'd for him, &s;o that his puni&s;hment was chang'd.</P>
<P>There was one of the Curti&s;ans that gave one of her Companions a box on the ear, not in the King's pre&s;ence, but in the Gallery where they were drinking together. However &s;he did not &s;trike &s;o &s;oftly, but that the King heard the noi&s;e of the blow. Whereupon he commanded her that had giv'n the blow to be had before the <HI>Deroga</HI> or Judge of the Town, whom he order'd to expunge her out of the number of Curti&s;ans, and to put another in her place; that &s;he &s;hould have a hundred <HI>Tomans</HI> giv'n her, and that the <HI>Deroga</HI> &s;hould cau&s;e her to be marry'd.</P>
<P>The next day I waited on the King, and receiv'd tho&s;e Models which he had be&s;poke me to &s;end into <HI>France.</HI> They were the Patterns of certain Drinking-Cups and Trenchers, with the Model of a Dagger drawn with his own hand: for he had learnt to draw of a couple of <HI>Dutch-men</HI> that were in his Service. The
<PB N="184" REF="109">
Dagger was to be Gold&s;mith work enamel'd. When I had receiv'd his In&s;tructions, I took my leave of his Maje&s;ty: and then going to wait upon the <HI>Nazar</HI> at his Country-hou&s;e, I took leave of him al&s;o, who a&s;&s;ur'd me of his affection upon all occa&s;ions, and did me &s;everal kindne&s;&s;es at my departure.</P>

<P>The <HI>Cheiks</HI> Sons con&s;idering of what a number of Slaves they were Ma&s;ters&punc; and that the greate&s;t part of the people, prepo&s;&s;es'd in favour of their Father, out of the opinion they had of his Sanctity, took their part; the more powerfully to engage them, &s;hew'd them&s;elves liberal to all, and when they found them&s;elves &s;trong enough, revolted again&s;t <HI>Alamout</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> their lawful Soveraign. After many Skirmi&s;hes, at length they gave him Battel near to <HI>Tauris,</HI> wherein <HI>Azi|mout</HI> was defeated, and &s;lain by the hand of <HI>I&s;mael Sophi,</HI> the <HI>Cheiks</HI> third Son, who is properly to be accounted the fi&s;t King of that Race: I mean of the Race of them that did not embrace the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but according to the Interpretation of <HI>Haly, Mahomets</HI> Son-in-Law.</P>
<P>To <HI>I&s;mael Sophi</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Sha-Tammas</HI> his Son, and to <HI>Sha-Tammas Sha-I&s;mael</HI> the &s;econd, who reign'd but a &s;hort while; for his cruelties con&s;train'd the Nobility of the Country to &s;et up in his room <HI>Mahomet-Coda. bend&eacute;</HI> his Brother; though little skill'd in the affairs of Government or War, Many thought he was blind, but he was only dim-&s;ighted, through the application of a hot Iron to his eyes, by the Command of his unnatural Brother in the beginning of his reign. He was the Father of <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> that &s;ucceeded him, who &s;etl'd the affairs of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in a very good condition.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the fir&s;t, by his Valour and good Conduct gain'd the name of Great. When he came to his Throne, upon the North and We&s;t &s;ide he found nothing in his power but the City of <HI>Casbin;</HI> but afterwards, as he was a per&s;onage of great wit as well as courage, partly by policy, and partly by force, he recover'd &s;everal Provinces to the We&s;t, and conquer'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Lar, Ormus,</HI> and <HI>Can|dahar.</HI></P>
<P>Of many Sons that <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> had, not one &s;urviv'd but only <HI>Sophi-Mirza,</HI> a Prince of great wit, and dextrous at his Arms. All the people lov'd him, which made his Father jealous of him, that he waited for his death to a&s;cend the Throne. And that which augmented his jealou&s;ie was, for that one day being a hunting, <HI>Sophi-Mirza</HI> drew the fir&s;t arrow at a Boar; it being a capital crime in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to &s;hoot before the King. However <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> for the time conceal'd his di&s;plea|&s;ure, unwilling to fly out in fury again&s;t the Prince, in regard he had no more Sons. But <HI>Sophi-Mirza</HI> having had a Son by a Slave, which pleas'd him, <HI>Sha-Abbas's</HI> joy encrea&s;ing as the Child grew, his jealou&s;ie al&s;o daily encreas'd again&s;t the Father of the young Prince; &s;o that being no longer able to di&s;&s;emble his fear, he caus'd his eyes to be put out. Nay his jealou&s;ie went a great way farther; for he now fear'd the blind Prince, and having therefore re&s;olv'd his death, he commanded a Lord of the Court to bring him his head. The Lord in an a&s;toni&s;hment refus'd to obey the King, and be&s;ought him rather to take away his life, than to con&s;train him to embrue his hands in the blood of his Prince. The King offended at him for his refu&s;al, bani&s;h'd him his Court; and the next day gave the &s;ame command to another Lord, who without any &s;cruple put it in execution, and brought him the head of his Son in a Ba&s;on of Gold. That object of pity brought him to him&s;elf; &s;o that not being able to look upon &s;o &s;ad a &s;pectacle without tears in his eyes, upbraiding the villany of the Lord, he ex|pell'd him from his &s;ight, forbad him his pre&s;ence for ever, and &s;eque&s;terd all his e&s;tate, only allowing him a Mamoudi, or nine <HI>French</HI> Sous aday. The other Lord, who had &s;o generou&s;ly refus'd to aid him in &s;o bloody an act, the King recall'd from Exile, and be&s;tow'd upon him one of the be&s;t Governments of the Empire.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince that time all the Male Children of the Blood Royal are &s;hut up in the Womens <HI>Haram,</HI> where they are bred up in ignorance, having only two or three Eunuchs to teach them to write and read, and to keep them company in their recreations, whether it be in &s;hooting with a Bow, or riding about the Gardens upon an A&s;s; for they never allow 'em a Hor&s;e: be&s;ides that all that time they are never permitted to &s;ee the people. In this manner it was that <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> bred up his little Grand&s;on, many days cau&s;ing him to take Opium to render him more &s;tupid. So that when he came to the Throne, after his Grand|fathers death, the Phy&s;icians thought it convenient that he &s;hould drink Wine, to re&s;tore his natural heat, and renew his vigor. <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> reign'd forty years,
<PB N="197" REF="111">
and dy'd at the end of the year 1628. Before he dy'd, he gave command, that he &s;hould be bury'd in &s;ome place unknown to all the world, and that they &s;hould &s;et his Grand-child upon his Throne, and give him the name of <HI>Sha-Sefi.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI>'s eyes were clos'd, the General of the Hor&s;e, and the chief Captain of the Harquebu&s;&s;es, with whom the Commands were left, rode in all ha&s;te to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and coming to the Palace, de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the Mo|ther of the Child. The Mother was in a &s;ad affright, believing that they came to put the young Prince to death. But when they had di&s;&s;ipated her fears, and that &s;he under&s;tood that they came to &s;et him upon the Throne by the command of his Grand-father, &s;he embrac'd the young Prince, and return'd him into the hands of the Eunuchs. When he was come out of the <HI>Haram,</HI> the two Lords, attended by &s;everal others, &s;aluted him King, and acknowledg'd him for their Soveraign. At the &s;ame time they took off his Cloaths and tore them, which in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is a mark of mourning; and according to cu&s;tom, put him on another plain Garment, which he wore till midnight. Then they di&s;rob'd him again, and put him on his Royal Robes, and &s;et him upon the Throne, where all the Lords came and did him homage, and the next day he was acknowledg'd by all the Acclamations of the People. For when the Royal Habit is put upon the new King, the Drums, Trumpets, Timbals, Haut boys, and other In&s;tru|ments, make a din in a peculiar place of the <HI>Meydan</HI> appointed for that purpo&s;e. Which is the Signal to give notice to the people to meet the next morning, to acknowledg the new King. <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> for many years was a Novice in the art of Government. But time opening his eyes the fir&s;t remarkable thing which he did, being at <HI>Casbin,</HI> was to cut off the head of <HI>Ali-Kouli-Kan,</HI> that great Captain who had conquer'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Ormus</HI> for <HI>Sha-Abbas;</HI> and the heads of three of his Sons. After that, returning to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> he cut off the heads of &s;even of the principal Lords of his Court; and by little and little took the Government into his own hands. Of tho&s;e Lords whom <HI>Jam-Kan</HI> was the chief.</P>
<P>For 'tis thought that <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> had left a private order with <HI>Mirza Take,</HI> and the Dowager <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> to rid them&s;elves of tho&s;e Lords &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> &s;hould be &s;etl'd in his Throne, and that they had plac'd Governors in all places wherein the King might confide. The&s;e Lords having &s;moak'd the private order of <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> and believing that the time of execution drew near, prevented the <HI>Athemadoulet Mirza Tak&eacute;;</HI> for meeting one morning before the Palace-door, they kill'd the Porter, and entring his Bed-Chamber, &s;tab'd him before he could ri&s;e. After this execution, they went to the King, whom <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ni-Kan</HI> boldly told, that they had &s;lain <HI>Mirza Tak&eacute;.</HI> The King at that time di&s;&s;embling his anger at &s;o bold an enterprize, and an attempt upon the Royal Authority, an&s;wer'd him, that he had done very well, and that he had prevented tho&s;e orders which he intended to have giv'n him. The <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> his Mother then govern'd the King|dom, together with the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> from whom &s;he receiv'd four hundred Ducats in Gold every day for her little plea&s;ures; and held a private Coun|cil with him in her <HI>Haram,</HI> where he had free admi&s;&s;ion, as being cut clo&s;e. In this Council it was, that the&s;e two per&s;ons over threw in the night whatever the Lords concluded in the day; chang'd the Kings mind, and over-rul'd his thoughts as they pleas'd them&s;elves, by vertue of that power which they had over him. Eight or nine days after, as the&s;e Lords were &s;itting in Council with the King, an Eunuch enter'd, which was the &s;ignal for the King to get out of the way; and as &s;oon as the King was gone, the Chamber was fill'd with Eunuchs, that ru&s;hing in immediately fell upon <HI>Jani-Kan</HI> and his Accomplices, and cut off their heads. Their heads and bodies were immediately expos'd to the view of the people in the <HI>Meydan;</HI> and for that it is not the cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to take any cognizance of what the King does, the mo&s;t part of the people &s;purning the heads with their feet, cry'd one to another, <HI>See the heads of tho&s;e Dogs that have di&s;obey'd the will of the King.</HI></P>
<P>I told ye, that <HI>Mirza Tak&eacute;</HI> was clean cut, which occa&s;ions a particular &s;tory: He was Governour of <HI>Guilan</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> and having abus'd one of his Pages, the young Lad &s;tole &s;ecretly to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and made his com|plaint

to the King; who having heard it, immediately &s;ent him to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Go|vernour of <HI>Guilan,</HI> in the place of <HI>Mirza Tak&eacute;,</HI> and order'd him to &s;end him his head by one of the Officers, which he di&s;patch'd along with him. The King al&s;o, in regard the Page was very young, appointed him a per&s;on able to advi&s;e him in his affairs. In the mean while <HI>Mirza Tak&eacute;</HI> mi&s;&s;ing his Page, and making no que&s;tion but he was gone to make his complaint to the King, which would of nece&s;&s;ity prove his ruin, if not prevented; he re&s;olv'd to di|vert the &s;torm by puni&s;hing him&s;elf, and caus'd that part to be cut clean off that committed the crime. At the &s;ame time, and in that bad condition where|in he then was, he caus'd him&s;elf to be put into a Litter, and taking his Chi|rurgeon along with him, he gets to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> by another way which was not u&s;ually travell'd, for fear of meeting the Page, and cau&s;ing him&s;elf to be car|ry'd into the Palace in that pitiful and langui&s;hing e&s;tate, de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the King, who was &s;urpriz'd at his arrival. But the <HI>Kan</HI> having pre&s;ented him in a plate of Gold with the undoubted marks of his repentance, be&s;ought his Maje&s;ties pardon. Whereupon the King con&s;idering the rigor and extraor|dinary puni&s;hment which he had inflicted upon him&s;elf &s;ent him back to his Govern|ment, and recall'd the Page, whom he otherways gratifi'd. And this was the man whom <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> upon his Death&punc;bed order'd that <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> &s;hould make <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> as being the fitte&s;t for the employment of any per&s;on in his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> not content to have rid him&s;elf of the Lords that had pre&s;um'd to invade his Authority, was re&s;olv'd to have the head of <HI>Ali-merdan-Kan,</HI> Go|vernour of <HI>Candahar;</HI> of whom he was jealous, by rea&s;on of his va&s;t riches, his Plate being all Gold, and his Hou&s;e as magnificently furni&s;h'd as the Kings. But the King could not bring about his de&s;ign; for the <HI>Kan</HI> being pre&s;s't to come to Court, and believing it was only to take away his head, to free him&s;elf from the danger, deliver'd <HI>Candahar</HI> to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> by whom he was kindly entertain'd, and highly cafe&s;s'd. Neither was <HI>Ali-merdan-Kan</HI>'s wealth of his own getting, but left him by inheritance, as being de&s;cended from the ancient Kings of <HI>Candahar,</HI> who were originally <HI>Tart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</HI> Now whatever favours or ad|vancement the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> be&s;tow'd upon <HI>Ali-merdan-Kan,</HI> the &s;ame did the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King be&s;tow upon his two Sons: whereas all the world believ'd, that after &s;uch a piece of Trea&s;on committed by their Father, the King would have ript up their bellies. This piece of policy of <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> was very advantageous to <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd, when he be&s;ieg'd <HI>Candahar</HI> with fifty thou&s;and men. For the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army being compos'd of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> they remembring how kindly <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> had us'd the two Sons of <HI>Ali-merdan-Kan,</HI> made little re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who enter'd <HI>Candahar</HI> in a &s;mall time. The Great <HI>Mogul</HI> troubl'd at the lo&s;s, ask'd <HI>Ali-merdan-Kan,</HI> by what means he might retake <HI>Candahar;</HI> who pre&s;ently made an&s;wer, that it would be very ea&s;ie, if he could find &s;uch another Traytor as he had been.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Sha-Sefi;</HI> his Reign was very violent, of which I will give you this Example:</P>
<P>One day the King returning from the <HI>Kelonters</HI> Hou&s;e in <HI>Zulpha,</HI> having drank to exce&s;s, commanded that the <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> &s;hould come to him; who un|der&s;tanding that he was in drink, made no great ha&s;te, &s;o that the King in the mean time fell a&s;leep&punc; But waking again &s;oon after, and not &s;eeing the Queen, he call'd for her a &s;econd time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of which when &s;he had notice, &s;he came im|mediately: When &s;he came into the Chamber, &s;he perceiv'd the King a&s;leep, and in expectation of his waking, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her &s;elf in a Nick behind the Hangings; where generally the Mattre&s;&s;es and Coverlets are laid by. The King waking, and not yet perceiving the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> in a great ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e demanded why &s;he was not yet come. The Queen-Mother, who was a <HI>Georgian</HI> Slave; and mortally hated the young <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> who was the Daughter of the King of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and therefore di&s;dain'd by her, took an occa&s;ion to put her out of the Kings fa|vour; and having fir&s;t &s;poken ill of her, made a &s;ign to the King to let him under&s;tand that the young Queen was hid in &s;uch a Nich. Upon that the King ri&s;ing in a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ury, &s;tab'd the poor Prince&s;s with his Dagger four or five&punc; times in the belly, and hardly knowing what he had done, went to bed again. The
<PB N="199" REF="112">
next day, forgetful of the Fact, he call'd for the Queen; but when they told him what had happen'd, he began to be deeply &s;en&s;ible of his error, and &s;or|row'd exce&s;&s;ively; and at the &s;ame time &s;ent an expre&s;s order through his Ter|ritories, that no man &s;hould drink Wine, and that the Governours &s;hould break all the Wine-Ve&s;&s;els wherever they found any, and &s;pill the Wine. But this order did not la&s;t above a year.</P>
<P>During the Reign of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivan</HI> &s;ent him a Colt, which I &s;aw, which was begot by a Mule. Not long after the King dy'd of a Surfeit, with exce&s;s of drinking, after he had reign'd fourteen years.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd was &s;et upon the Throne at <HI>Casbin,</HI> with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, at the end of the year 1642, and made his entry into <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in the beginning of the year following. Upon the day of Solemnity all the Citizens were order'd to be in Arms, and to march out of the City, where they were fil'd off upon each &s;ide of the Road. In the &s;ame manner were all the &s;tanding Infantry and Cavalry rang'd for five Leagues together, All the Road for two Leagues together without the City was cover'd with Ti&s;&s;ues of Gold and Silver, with Carpets of Silk, and other rich Stuffs; all which co&s;ts the King nothing. For the <HI>Sha-Bander,</HI> who is like our Mayor, takes care to tax every one what he is to furni&s;h toward that Solemnity. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> went al&s;o forth to meet the King; among whom I was one. When we came near the King, <HI>Jani-Kan,</HI> General of the Cavalry, gave the King notice who we were. Whereupon we all alighted, and the King holding his Leg &s;tretcht out of his Stirrup, we all ki&s;s'd his Boot. When he came where the way began to be &s;pread with rich Carpets, he found the Grand <HI>Mufti</HI> and the Grand <HI>Cadi,</HI> at|tended by a great number of <HI>Moullahs,</HI> who made a Prayer after their man|ner. Prayers being ended, the King rode on, the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> being on the left hand, which is the mo&s;t honourable, and the General of the Cavalry on the right, yet not even with him, but &s;o as that their Hor&s;es heads reach'd to the Crupper of his. There was no per&s;on but the King that rode over the Ti&s;&s;ue, that Honour belonging to him alone; nor is the way &s;pread above the breadth of the Stuff; and as &s;oon as the King is pa&s;s'd over it, the people fall to &s;crambling, and carry away every one what they can get for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a League from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is a Garden, with a Great Room over the Gate, where the King made a halt, thinking to have made his Entry into the City. But an A&s;trologer came to him, and told him, that the hour was pa&s;t, and that he mu&s;t tarry three days before the hour would prove propitious again. So that he was con&s;train'd to betake him&s;elf to the Garden of <HI>Hezardgerib</HI> till the time came, whither the Nobility al&s;o were all forc'd to come betimes in the morn|ing, and to &s;tay till the evening. The day that the King made his Entry, the way from the Garden to the City was al&s;o &s;pread with Carpets. For three days to|gether the Fire-works play'd in the <HI>Meydan;</HI> and round the <HI>Piazza</HI> from top to bottom were lights hung out; and in the principal Inns, the riche&s;t Merchants, had adorn'd the Doors and Windows of their Chambers, according to the Mode of the Country; and I believe it co&s;t the Chief of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, above nine hundred Tomans.</P>
<P>In the year 1643, came the Prince of the <HI>&V;sbecks</HI> in per&s;on to de&s;ire aid of <HI>Sha&punc;Abbas</HI> again&s;t his Children, who had caus'd his own Subjects to rebel and make war again&s;t him. His elde&s;t Son fir&s;t took Arms, and getting the advan|tage of a Battel, the other Brother treacherou&s;ly took part with him; which nothing di&s;may'd the Father, to whom the chief of the Nobility &s;till adher'd. Toward the end of the year 1642, the Prince lo&s;t another Battel and his left, eye, which was &s;hot thorough with an Arrow; which con&s;train'd him, &s;o &s;oon as he was cur'd of his wound, to come and crave &s;uccour from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> which he ea&s;ily obtain'd. <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> de&s;igning to receive him honou|rably &s;ent above ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e as far as <HI>Ca&s;han;</HI> which is four days jour|ney from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and five or &s;ix thou&s;and Foot two days journey from thence to meet him. Every day he was attended by different Officers. Every day they &s;et him up a new Tent, and &s;pread new Carpets; and every day chang'd the twelve Hor&s;es that were led before him, who&s;e furniture was all over cover'd with Jewels. For a League and a half from the City the way was &s;pread with
<PB N="200" REF="113">
all &s;orts of Silk Stuffs to the very Palace; and the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> went him|&s;elf to meet him, as far as where the Stuffs were begun to be laid. Though <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> was very young, yet he was re&s;olv'd to &s;hew, that he look'd upon him&s;elf as a potent King in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own Dominions, and that he went to meet a dethron'd Prince, that came to de&s;ire his Aid. For &s;o &s;oon as he perceiv'd the King of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> he made a &s;hew of &s;purring on his Hor&s;e; and being come up to his Hor&s;es head, he put his foot out of the Stur|rup, as if he intended to have alighted, but did not. The <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince, as old as he was, pre&s;ently leap't to the ground from his Saddle to &s;alute the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, who return'd him &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">light Compliments about his having alighted; at which time the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> and other Lords remounting him, the two Kings rode together upon the Silks, the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> giving the left hand to the <HI>Tartar.</HI> The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> very generou&s;ly lent him a con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of 15000 Hor&s;e&punc; and 8000 Foot, and &s;ixty thou&s;and Tomans in Money. The <HI>Tartar</HI> in Exchange gave him one of his Provinces bordering upon <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which yeilded him a very good Revenue, in regard the Inhabitants were all Shepherds, or <HI>Tur|eomans,</HI> that breed an infinite number of Cattel, wherein the wealth of that Pro|vince con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>While he reign'd, he had a Pre&s;ent made him from the Governour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> of a Wild A&s;s, who&s;e Skin was as red as Scarlet, having a Horn growing out of his forehead about a foot long.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> reign'd about twenty-four years, and dy'd at <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">zon,</HI> of an in|flammation in his throat, which came by exce&s;&s;ive drinking. His body by his own order was buri'd at <HI>Kour.</HI> So &s;oon as he was dead, the Lords that were about him, &s;ent advice of his death to the Prince that now reigns, by the <HI>To|pigi-Ba&s;ha,</HI> who is General of the Mu&s;queteers, and <HI>Mirza Bayad</HI> the Chief of the A&s;trologers. So &s;oon as they came to the door of the <HI>Haram,</HI> they de|&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the Mother and the Son; who believ'd them come upon &s;ome di&s;mal de&s;ign. But they pre&s;ently confirm'd them to the contrary. For as &s;oon as the Prince came forth of the <HI>Haram,</HI> they &s;ell at his feet, and &s;aluted him King, declaring the death of his Father. Whereupon the Prince imme|diately tore his Garment according to the cu&s;tom. And indeed they have another cu&s;tom, that as &s;oon as the new Prince comes after much entreaty out of the <HI>Haram,</HI> he throws him&s;elf to the ground, at the door of the <HI>Haram,</HI> and then ri&s;ing and &s;itting upon his heels, one of the Lords that are &s;ent, girds the Scimiter about his wa&s;te, &s;aying the&s;e words, <HI>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty to remember your Slave, that had the Honour to gird you with this Scimiter.</HI> Which done, he goes and &s;ets the Trumpets a &s;ounding, and the Drums beating, whereupon all the people in the morning come running to the Gate of the Palace, crying out, <HI>Pat&s;ha Salamalek, I &s;alute thee Emperour.</HI> Which is all the Ceremony us'd when any King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> a&s;cends the Throne. For I never &s;aw any Crown &s;et upon the head either of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> or <HI>Sha-Sefi.</HI> Only in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they gird on the Scimiter, as in <HI>Turky</HI> they put on the Bonnet of the <HI>Sophi's,</HI> which is very richly &s;et with Jewels, but has not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance of a Crown. The &s;ame Ceremony of girding on the Scimiter, is us'd to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and <HI>Golconda;</HI> and they al&s;o put the Bon|net upon their heads, which is &s;et with the riche&s;t Jewels in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e great Monarchs.</P>
<P><HI>Sha Sefi</HI> the &s;econd, &s;ome time after his coming to the Throne, fell dange|rou&s;ly &s;ick, not having ever enjoy'd a perfect health before. Now it is the cu&s;tom in tho&s;e Countries, that upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion all the Lords of the Court, and Governors of Provinces, give a &s;um of money, according to their willingne&s;s and liberality. This &s;um is u&s;ually in Gold, which they put into a Ba&s;on very richly &s;et with precious Stones, and bear it three times over the King's he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, pro|nouncing the&s;e words, <HI>Pat&s;ha Ba&s;hena Ol&s;on, This money is &s;acrific'd for the health of the Kings head.</HI> If the King recover all that money is giv'n to the poor, to which the King and his <HI>Haram</HI> add very liberally. But if the King dies, the money is put into the Trea&s;ury, and the poor have nothing. The twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1667, was the critical day of his di&s;temper, and every one thought he would have dy'd. Upon which all the Grandees of the Court &s;eeing him in that condition, went to the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> call'd <HI>Babaron,</HI> which is without the City, to
<PB N="201" REF="113">
pray for his health, and altogether gave near a thou&s;and Tomans to the poor. The next day they commanded the Chri&s;tian <HI>Armenians</HI> to pray for the reco|very of the King. Whereupon as well the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks as the Laity went to their prayers upon the &s;ide of the River which is between <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and <HI>Zulpha.</HI> They al&s;o &s;ent their <HI>Kelonter,</HI> with fifty Tomans in Gold, to bear over the Kings head; though the <HI>Armenians</HI> pronounce not the &s;ame words as the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;aying only, <HI>Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i te Sadduk, de&s;tin'd for Alms.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the danger being over in a few days, they made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to re|cover him to a perfect habit of health; but in regard the King continu'd in a langui&s;hing condition, and for that the Phy&s;icians could not di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the di&s;temper, the King began to believe that it proceeded from the igno|rance of the Phy&s;icians; for which rea&s;on &s;ome of them had receiv'd none of the be&s;t entertainment already. At length it came into the thoughts of &s;ome others of the Phy&s;icians, who were afraid for them&s;elves, that in regard <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was thus doubly afflicted, with Famine and Sickne&s;s of the King, both at one time, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be the A&s;trologers fault, that mi&s;s'd the favourable hour when the King &s;hould have a&s;cended the Throne. Thus being troubl'd at their di&s;grace, pretending to have no le&s;s skill in future knowledg than the A&s;trologers, who had not chos'n a true time for the King to a&s;cend the Throne, they concluded that for the perfect recovery of his health, and the re&s;toring of plenty to the Nation, it was nece&s;&s;ary to renew the Ceremony at a lucky hour, and to change his name. This propo&s;ition pleas'd the King and his Council. The Phy&s;itians and A&s;tro|logers joining together, ob&s;erv'd the fir&s;t unlucky day, which would certainly be follow'd by another that would prove fortunate. Now there being among the <HI>Gaures,</HI> &s;ome that pretend them&s;elves de&s;cended from the <HI>Ru&s;tans,</HI> who were ancient Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Parthia,</HI> that very morning one of tho&s;e <HI>Gaures</HI> &s;etting him&s;elf upon the Throne, with his back again&s;t a wooden Figure which repre&s;ent|ed him to the life, all the Grandees of the Court came and did him homage as their King, as he had order'd them to do. This action la&s;ted till the favourable hour was come, which happen'd a little before Sun-&s;et. Then it was that an Officer of the Court came behind and cut off the head of the wooden Figure, while the <HI>Gaure</HI> immediately took his heels and fled. Pre&s;ently upon that the King ap|pear'd in the Hall, upon who&s;e head when they had put the Bonnet of <HI>Sophi,</HI> and re&punc;girt him with the Scimitar, he a&s;cended the Throne, and took the name of <HI>Soliman.</HI> He was forc'd to act this Comedy to &s;atisfie the Law, which contriv'd that he &s;hould change his Name, and take a new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Throne, by ejecting a U&s;urper that had wrongfully clam'd it. For which rea&s;on the <HI>Gaure</HI> was &s;et up as Pretender, as laying claim to the ancient Lineage of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings, and being of a different Religion. From that time the King reco|vering, and the Famine decrea&s;ing, the Phy&s;icians were in great repute, and the A&s;trologers were ca&s;t out of favour, except two or three of the mo&s;t skil|ful.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Soliman</HI> before his coming to the Crown, had convers'd with none but Women and black Eunuchs; from whom he could not learn the art of Ruling. At pre&s;ent he only divertizes him&s;elf with his Wives in going a hunting, very rare|ly troubling him&s;elf with bu&s;ine&s;s but relying wholly upon his Mini&s;ters of State. He will not be &s;een for ten or twelve days together; all which time there are no Petitions to be preferr'd, nor Complaints to be made.</P>

<P><HI>SHa-Abbas,</HI> who was a pa&s;&s;ionate Lover of Honour, &s;ought all ways ima|ginable to furni&s;h his Empire with the &s;upports of wealth and good Government.

Neither had <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> any rea&s;on to permit them to trade in his Kingdom; for they are wor&s;e U&s;urers than the <HI>Jews,</HI> and &s;eldom it happens, but that they have all the Money in the Nation, which they take up at nine or ten in the hundred, and let out again upon pawns at two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> a month.

<P>I was at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in the year 1662, when one of tho&s;e <HI>Banians</HI> lent &s;ix or &s;even Tomans <HI>per Cent.</HI> a month to a poor <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> who had utter'd &s;everal pieces of Linnen upon the place.

Thereupon the <HI>Banian</HI> dunn'd him perpetually, and threaten'd to have him drub'd till he pay'd it, according to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> cu&s;tom. The Mother of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> troubl'd to &s;ee her Son haunted in that manner, one morning as he was going to the <HI>Meydan,</HI> bid him, if he met the <HI>Banian,</HI> that he &s;hould be &s;ure to bring him home, and &s;he would pay him his Intere&s;t, and &s;ome of the principal, with &s;ome Money that &s;he had &s;av'd of her one. Toward even|ing the <HI>Banian</HI> met his Debtor, whom he readily follow'd home upon promi&s;e of payment. The Mother de&s;ir'd him to &s;et upon the <HI>Caur&s;i,</HI> which is the place where they make their fires, it being cold &s;nowy weather, and &s;et fruits before him to eat. While he thus eat and warm'd him&s;elf, night came on apace, and the woman putting him in hopes of payment, &s;pun out the time &s;o long, that the <HI>Banian</HI> not being unaccu&s;tom'd to cold weather and late hours, was ea&s;ily per&s;wad|ed to &s;tay all night at the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Hou&s;e. When 'twas time to go to Bed, the <HI>Ba|nian</HI> threw him&s;elf upon one Quilt, and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> upon another. About two houres after midnight, the Mother comes &s;oftly into the Chamber, with a &s;harp Razor in her hand, intending to have cut off the <HI>Banians</HI> head; but unfortunately mi&s;taking, kill'd her own Son in&s;tead of the <HI>Banian.</HI> The <HI>Banian</HI> having had &s;uch an e&s;cape, &s;tole cunningly out of the Hou&s;e, and declaring the murther to the <HI>Divan-bequ&eacute;,</HI> or the Chief Ju&s;tice, He caus'd the woman to be apprehended, and brought before him; who confe&s;&s;ing the fact, he commanded her to be ty'd to the tail of a young Mule, and to be dragg'd about the City till the Mule had kick'd her to death.</P>
<P>In the year 1667, eight or ten days before I departed from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> there was a <HI>Banian</HI> found buri'd in a Street near the <HI>Capuchins</HI> hou&s;e; they had cut off his arms and legs, and &s;o put him into the hole; but buri'd him &s;o &s;hallow that the Dogs &s;crap'd away the Earth, and di&s;cover'd him; but who committed the fact, was not then known.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> was not only willing that all the trade &s;hould be in the hands of his Subjects, to make profit thereby, and to draw the Money into his King|dom, but he would not &s;uffer it to be tran&s;ported when it was brought in. He &s;aw that the Pilgrimages of his Subjects to <HI>Mecca,</HI> their Expences and Pre|&s;ents carry'd out abundance of his Ducats of Gold; therefore more politick than religious, he &s;trove to hinder tho&s;e Pilgrimages as much as in him lay; and

going him&s;elf in per&s;on to <HI>Me&s;hed</HI> in Pilgrimage to the Tomb of <HI>Iman-rez</HI> al|ready &s;poken of, over which one of the Legs of <HI>Mahomets</HI> Camel hangs as a great Relict; and upon his return relating and giving out &s;trange Miracles of <HI>Iman-rez,</HI> on purpo&s;e to divert his Subjects from going to <HI>Mecca.</HI></P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the cunning knacks that <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> made u&s;e of, to know how &s;quares went in his Kingdom, without tru&s;ting too much to his Mini&s;ters, he oft'n di&s;guis'd him&s;elf, and went about the City like an ordinary inhabitant, un|der pretence of buying and &s;elling, making it his bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cover whether Mer|chants us'd fal&s;e weights or mea&s;ures or no. To this intent one evening going out of his Palace in the habit of a Countryman, he went to a Bakers to buy a <HI>Man</HI> of Bread, and thence to a Cook to buy a <HI>Man</HI> of Ro&s;t-meat, (a <HI>Man</HI> is &s;ix Pound, &s;ix|teen Ounces to the Pound.) The King having bought his Bargains return'd to Court, where he caus'd the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> to weigh both the Bread and the Meat exactly. He found the Bread to want fifty-&s;even Drams, and the Meat forty-three. The King &s;eeing that, fell into a great chafe again&s;t three or four of them that were about him, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to look after tho&s;e things; but e&s;pecially again&s;t the Governour of the City, who&s;e Belly he had caus'd to have been ript up, but for the interce&s;&s;ion of certain Lords. Be&s;ides the reproaches that he threw upon them for being &s;o negligent in their Employments; and for their little affection to the publick good, he laid before them the inju&s;tice of fal&s;e weights; and how &s;adly the cheat fell upon poor men, who having great Families, and thinking to give them eight hundred Drams of Bread, by that fraud depriv'd them of a hundred and forty three. Then turning to the Lords that were pre&s;ent, he demanded of them, what &s;ort of ju&s;tice ought to be done tho&s;e people? When none of them daring to open their mouths, while he was in that pa&s;&s;ion, he commanded a great Oven to be made in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> together with a Spit long enough to roa&s;t a man; and that the Oven &s;hould be heated all Night, and that they &s;hould make another fire to be kindl'd hard by the Oven. The next morning the King caus'd the Baker and the Cook to be apprehended, and to be led quite through the City, with two men go|ing before them, who cry'd to the people, We are going to put the Baker into a red hot Oven made in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where he is to be bak'd alive, for having utter'd Bread by fal&s;e weights; and the Cook is to be roa&s;ted a live, for having &s;old meat by fal&s;e weights. Thus tho&s;e two men &s;erv'd for an example not only to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but to all the Kingdom, where every one dreaded the &s;evere ju&s;tice of <HI>Sha-Abbas.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of what fell out mo&s;t memorable in the Reign of <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> the fir&s;t; and particularly of the death of <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</HI> and his three Sons.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMan-Kouli-Kan</HI> was the la&s;t <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Schiras,</HI> who&s;e Government extended over the Province of <HI>Lar,</HI> to the Golf of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the&s;e <HI>Kans</HI> being the mo&s;t potent in all <HI>Per&s;ia, Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> was he who in the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> conquer'd the greate&s;t part of the Kingdom of <HI>Lar,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Ormus,</HI> with all the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Golf, from <HI>Cape Ja&s;ques</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> was prodigiou&s;ly rich, belov'd and re&s;pected by all the world; be&s;ides he was wonderfully magnificent, his expenses almo&s;t equalling the Kings; which occa&s;ion'd <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> who di&s;cours'd with him one day parti|cularly upon that Subject, to tell him, that he de&s;ir'd him to &s;pend every day one <HI>Mamoudy</HI> le&s;s than he, that there might be &s;ome difference between the expences of a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Kan.</HI></P>
<P>The noble qualities of this <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> had gain'd the affections of the people; for he was magnificent and liberal; highly recompenc'd brave Soldiers and Students; he lov'd Strangers, and had a particular care to cheri&s;h Arts and Sciences. To which purpo&s;e he built a fair Colledg at <HI>Schiras,</HI> for the in&s;truction of Youth; and &s;everal Inns, as well in the City as upon the Roads; for the Tra|vellers. He caus'd Mountains to be cut thorough to &s;horten the way; and join'd others by Bridges, of &s;uch an advanturous Structure, that it is hard to conjecture how &s;uch prodigious Arches could be made over &s;uch va&s;t Precipices and Torrents.</P>
<P>Now in regard <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan&punc;</HI> was &s;trick'n in years, he &s;eldom went to Court, chu&s;ing rather to continue in his Government, where he was belov'd and re&s;pected by all men. But the King being young, and the Government of the Kingdom in the hands of the Queen-Mother and the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> who were extreamly jealous of the <HI>Kan,</HI> tho&s;e two per&s;ons link'd together in Intere&s;t for the maintenance of the Kings Authority and their own, fretted to &s;ee the <HI>Kan</HI>'s Court almo&s;t as &s;plendid as the Kings; and that nothing of the Reve|nue of <HI>Schiras, Lar, Ormus,</HI> or any part of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Golf came to the Kings Coffers, as being &s;olely at the di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>Kan;</HI> but that on the contrary, the King was oblig'd to &s;end him Money to pay the Army. But that which troubled the Queen-Mother mo&s;t of all, was the pretention of the <HI>Kan</HI>'s elde&s;t Son to the Crown, who was al&s;o a per&s;on of a daring and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mbitious courage. For the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> e&s;teem it a great Honour to be&s;tow upon any <HI>Kan</HI> or great Lord, one of their Wives out of their Royal <HI>Haram;</HI> and <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> had given to <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> one of his own proper Wives, whom he lov'd extreamly. 'Tis thought that when &s;he left the <HI>Haram</HI> &s;he was three months gone with Child by <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> for &s;omewhat above &s;ix months after &s;he was bedded by the <HI>Kan,</HI> &s;he lay-in of a Son, of which the King was the reputed Father, and who being born before <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> pretended a right before him to the Throne. By vertue of this claim, contrary to the will of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> in favour of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> this ambitious Lord, who only pa&s;s'd for the <HI>Kan</HI>'s elde&s;t Son, vehemently &s;ollicited his Father to &s;eize upon <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> and to make him|&s;elf King, or at lea&s;t to op'n a way for him to the Throne. Now it happen'd, that one day being a hunting with the young King near <HI>Schiras,</HI> the impatient young Lord coming to his Father; Sir, &s;aid he, &s;ee now the opportunity that offers you the Throne; for I will go pre&s;ently and bring you <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI>'s head. But the <HI>Kan</HI> holding his Son by the Arm, told him, that he would never con|&s;ent to the death of his King; prote&s;ting to him, rather to dye a thou&s;and deaths; adding withall, that it was the Kings will to appoint <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> to &s;uc|ceed him, as being the Son of his Son, and con&s;equently his lawful Heir: that
<PB N="205" REF="115">
the young Prince was recommended to his care, and in regard he had promis'd and &s;worn, he was &s;o far from fal&s;ifying his tru&s;t, that he would maintain his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>This generous re&s;olution of the <HI>Kan</HI> broke the young Lords de&s;ign upon the Kings per&s;on. However the <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> being not ignorant of the train that was laid for the young King, and again&s;t the repo&s;e of the Kingdom, thought it her wi&s;e&s;t way to prevent the blow, and to rid her &s;elf o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch per&s;ons as had con&s;pir'd the death of the King. The <HI>Kan</HI>'s two other Sons took part with him they call'd their elder Brother. And as for the <HI>Kan</HI> him&s;elf, though he were upright in his Loyalty, yet his power, his wealth, his reputation among the Souldiery, and the affection that the people bare him, concurr'd together not only to render him &s;u&s;pected, but guilty. The <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> took coun&s;el together, which way to divert the &s;torm that threaten'd the Kings head, to whom they repre&s;ented, that he was not &s;afe in his own per&s;on &s;o long as <HI>Iman-Kouli Kan</HI> and his three elde&s;t Sons liv'd. The King ea&s;ily be|liev'd them, and re&s;olv'd to be rid both of Father and Sons together, but the difficulty was to get 'em to Court, wherein opportunity it &s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted them. For at that time <HI>Amurath</HI> the Great <HI>Turk</HI> at the head of a va&s;t Ar|my, was already advanc'd within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> had tak'n <HI>Erivan,</HI> and had ruin'd <HI>Tauris.</HI> Upon the fir&s;t news of this march, the King &s;ends for all the <HI>Kans</HI> and Governours to attend his per&s;on, with all the Forces under their command. Among the re&s;t, the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> receiv'd the &s;ame orders; who thereupon a&s;&s;embl'd all his Troops, both Hor&s;e and Foot, who were not only the mo&s;t numerous, but the be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd and &s;toute&s;t Souldiers of all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> As he was upon his march to <HI>Casbin</HI> with his three Sons, the elde&s;t having well con&s;ider'd of affairs; Sir, &s;aid he, <HI>We are making ha&s;t to the King, to the end our heads may the &s;ooner fall at our feet. Perhaps my Son,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Kan, thou mai&s;t &s;peak the truth; but to this day I never was a Rebel again&s;t the King, I have done whatever he commanded, and whatever may happ'n I will obey him till death.</HI> The <HI>Kan</HI> arriving at <HI>Casbin,</HI> was by the King welcom'd with great de|mon&s;tration of joy. Some days after, he took a general Mu&s;ter, and then made a great&punc; Fea&s;t which la&s;ted three day, to which all the great Lords and <HI>Kans</HI> that were at <HI>Casbin</HI> were call'd. The three Sons of <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> were of the number; but the Father excus'd him&s;elf, as well by rea&s;on of his age, as al&s;o repre&s;enting to his Maje&s;ty, that it better befitted him to employ his time in taking care of his affairs, and in praying for his Maje&s;ty; however if it were his Maje&s;ties expre&s;s command, he would not fail to obey; to which the King return'd for an&s;wer, that the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> was at his liberty to do as he thought fit. The third day of the Fea&s;t the King ro&s;e from his Seat, and going out of the Hall, without &s;peaking a word to any per&s;on, went into a Room hard by. Half an hour after, three &s;turdy re&s;olute Fellows with &s;ome other Ragamuffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> attendants entring the Hall with their Scimeters drawn, &s;eiz'd upon the <HI>Kans</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hree Sons, and cut off their heads. They were put&punc; into a Gold Ba&s;on, and pre&s;ented to the King; who commanded the Fellows to carry them to their Father, and as &s;oon as he had &s;een them, to take off his head to make the fourth. The A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates found him at his prayers; but being in|terrupted to &s;ee the heads of his three Sons, he de&s;ir'd leave only to conclude, which having done, with a countenance undi&s;turb'd, and without any other words or expre&s;&s;ions in his mouth than what is u&s;ually &s;aid among the <HI>Per|&s;ians, Let the Kings will be done,</HI> he &s;ubmitted to a death which he might have ea&s;ily avoided. The four heads were brought back to the King, to be &s;ent into the <HI>Haram</HI> to his Mother. So &s;oon as he had taken off the heads of the Father and the three Sons, the King di&s;patch'd away certain <HI>Chappars</HI> or Courriers, with order to the Lieutenant of the <HI>Kan,</HI> to put to death all the re&s;t of the Chil|dren. The command was obey'd, and they were all put to death, but only two that were at Nurfe whom their Nur&s;es &s;o well conceal'd, that never any tidings could be heard either of the Nur&s;es or of the Children.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</HI> the Province of <HI>Schiras,</HI> with its de|pendances, has been govern'd by a <HI>Vizir,</HI> who agrees with the King what Rent to pay him yearly. In the years 1665 and 1666, the <HI>Vizir</HI> gave him fifty
 
<PB N="206" REF="116">
thou&s;and Tomans a year. But in the year 1667, the King abated him eight thou|&s;and Tomans, in regard he had taken from him a &s;mall part of his Government to plea&s;ure a Favourite.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what the Government of <HI>Schiras</HI> pays to the King in ready Money, he is oblig'd every year to &s;end him a pre&s;ent of all the rarities that grow or are bred in the Province. The&s;e Pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;t in Hor&s;es, of which there is the be&s;t breed of any Province of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> In Granates, Oranges, and Le|mons, &s;weet Oils and Waters of &s;everal &s;orts, e&s;pecially Oil of Ro&s;es, with which the women rub their bodies and heads; and the water of a certain Flower that grows upon a tree not much unlike our Willows, which water is call'd <HI>Arak-Bilmit&s;he,</HI> which is a great refre&s;hment to tho&s;e that u&s;e it; be|&s;ides other Oils and E&s;&s;ences which the Governour is oblig'd to pre&s;ent. Yet were he only oblig'd to pre&s;ent the King, the expence might be born well enough; but for fear of being di&s;plac'd by any other Favourite, he is con|&s;train'd to make Friends of all the other great Lords and Favourites at Court; which there is no way to do, but by continual pre&s;ents. Whereas the ancient <HI>Kans,</HI> who were a kind of pretty Soveraigns in their Governments, were only wont to &s;end a few Baskets of new Fruits in their &s;ea&s;on for the &s;ervice of the Kings Table. To defray this expence, the Governours are forc'd to ty|rannize over the people; who when they come, as many times they do, two or three Villages together, to complain to the King, are forc'd after long wait|ing, to return with empty Pur&s;es home again, by rea&s;on that they who &s;hould give them admi&s;&s;ion, are the only per&s;ons that debar them from it; and pa|tiently to &s;ubmit to the Extortions of the <HI>Vizar;</HI> which is a piece of policy pra|ctis'd likewi&s;e by all the other <HI>Kans</HI> and <HI>Governours</HI> of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Provinces. As for <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> him&s;elf, he was very &s;evere, and one who&s;e puni&s;hments oft'n amounted to acts of cruelty. One day being a hunting, a poor Country man appear'd from behind a Rock, with a Paper in his hand, being deputed by the Village to make &s;ome complaint to the King. But while the poor man cry'd for ju&s;tice, the King without making any an&s;wer, &s;hot two arrows into his body and &s;lew him. That which mov'd <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> to this act of cruelty, was becau&s;e he had &s;ome of his Wives with him in company. For then there is no mercy to tho&s;e poor people that happ'n to be in the way where the King chances to pa&s;s by: no not for them that are in the Country round about, where the Eunuchs have order to kill all men they meet. When the King gives notice of his intention to carry his Wives into the Country, this is call'd <HI>Courouk;</HI> and there is nothing more trouble&s;ome nor more inconvenient in the world to the poor people that live in the Villages through which the&s;e women are to pa&s;s; for upon notice giv'n them, they mu&s;t leave their Hou&s;es for a League or two of either &s;ide. When there is a <HI>Courouk</HI> at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> let the weather be never &s;o bad, the people mu&s;t leave their Hou&s;es, and if they have no Friends in &s;ome di&s;tant quarter to retire to, they have no way but to repair to the Moun|tains. Such is the exce&s;s of the jealou&s;ie of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> which indeed de|rives it &s;elf to all his Subjects, who will not permit their women to be &s;een by any but their own Husbands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> both men and women are &s;o addicted to take Tobacco, that to take Tobacco from them, is to take away their lives. So that if the King &s;hould prohibit &punc;Tobacco for any time, he would lo&s;e a good part of his reve|nue. However <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> in a humor having once forbidd'n Tobacco to be taken in any part of his Dominion, his Spies (that are in every City) found in the <HI>Indian</HI> Inn two rich Merchants of that Nation &s;moaking their no&s;es. Immediately they were &s;eiz'd, bound, and carry'd to the King, who commanded forthwith that Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done upon them in the <HI>Meidan,</HI> which was, that they &s;hould pour melted lead down their throats till they were dead.</P>
<P>The people thought the King had only intended to have &s;car'd them, and would have repriev'd them upon the place. In&s;omuch that four <HI>Banians</HI> went to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> and offer'd&punc; to pay two thou&s;and Tomans into the Kings Trea&s;ury, &s;o that he would be pleas'd to &s;pare the two Merchants lives. The chief Mini&s;ter made the propo&s;al, but the King falling into a pa&s;&s;ion, and asking the <HI>Athemadoulet, whether tho&s;e Indian Dogs thought that a King of</HI> Per&s;ia <HI>would</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="116">
<HI>&s;ell Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;ent a &s;econd order for the execution of the Merchants without delay.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> having giv'n command that the Eyes of a young Lord of the Court &s;hould be put out, one of the principal Officers of the Hou&s;e being pre&s;ent, and &s;eeing the Executioner prick the eyes of the unfortunate young man with the point of a &s;mall knife, &s;hut his own eyes and turn'd away his head, as abhorring &s;uch a &s;pectacle. The King perceiving it, and vex'd to fee tho&s;e &s;igns of pity, and a di&s;like of an act that he approv'd; <HI>What,</HI> &s;aid he in a fury, <HI>art thou afraid to pu|ni&s;h the wicked?</HI> And at the &s;ame time commanded his eyes to be pull'd out of his head.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom, that if any man points at the King as he pa&s;&s;es along in the Street, or upon the Road, he mu&s;t lo&s;e his hand. One day <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> being in the Country, two Merchants of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> were upon the Road, where the King and his Train were to pa&s;s. They &s;topp'd to &s;ee the King, and when he came near, one of the Merchants pray'd his Friend that oft'n had &s;een him, to &s;hew him which was he. The other knowing that only the King wears the Heron tops in his Bonnet, inno|cently lifted up his hand to di&s;tingui&s;h him, by pointing, from the re&s;t of the Lords that follow'd him.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The tragical and memorable Story of <HI>Ralph Sadler,</HI> Native of <HI>Zu|rich,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> who had retain'd him in his Service.</HEAD>
<P><HI>RAlph Sadler,</HI> born in <HI>Zurich,</HI> was a Watch-maker by Profe&s;&s;ion, who put him|&s;elf into the &s;ervice of the Emperors Re&s;ident at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, with whom he went to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> This man I de&s;ir'd to take along with me into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and coming to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> he &s;et him&s;elf to work, and made a &s;mall Watch about the bigne&s;s of half a Crown; which being a neat piece of work, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would needs buy, to pre&s;ent it to <HI>Iman-Couli-Kan,</HI> paying the price demanded, which was two hundred Crowns. <HI>Iman-Couli-Kan</HI> pre&s;ented it to the King; who was mightily pleas'd with it, in regard it was the lea&s;t &s;triking Watch that ever had been &s;een by the King, who therefore carry'd it hanging about his Neck under his Cloathes, in a Gold Chain. One day the King happening to wind up his Watch, and turning the Key the wrong way, broke the Fu&s;il, for which he was &s;o much troubl'd, that he &s;ent for the Watch-maker from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Casbin;</HI> whither when <HI>Ralph</HI> came, he pre&s;ently made the Watch as good as ever. The King thus &s;atisfy'd in his work and in his per|&s;on, order'd him a Pen&s;ion of thirty Tomans, and Diet for him and a man, and provi&s;ion for two Hor&s;es: commanding him withall to make &s;ome new pieces of work. Now a skilful workman in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, has this advantage, that if he plea&s;es the King, be&s;ides his Wages that are duly paid, the King out of his liberality be&s;tows on him a pre&s;ent, which u&s;ually amounts to a third part or half his Wages; or el&s;e his Wages are rais'd, which is more advantage|ous than a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Ralph</HI> was oblig'd every morning to wait upon the King at his ri&s;ing, to wind up his Watch; and was &s;o much in the Kings favour, that every morn|ing when he came out of the Kings Chamber, he had a Gla&s;s of Wine pre|&s;ented him, as a mark of e&s;teem. And indeed the King had &s;uch an affection for him, that to retain him in his &s;ervice he often &s;ollicited him to turn <HI>Maho|metan.</HI></P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> coming to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and &s;eeing <HI>Ralph</HI> &s;o much in favour with the King, endeavour'd to gain his Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Ralph</HI> oft'n keeping company with the Emba&s;&s;adors, and having one time tarry'd till late at night upon the debauch with them, returning home to
<PB N="208" REF="117">
his Lodging, where he kept a young <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> girl, in the Court of the Hou&s;e met a young <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> Brother to one of the Kings Porters. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> knowing him|&s;elf guilty, and &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee <HI>Ralph</HI> &s;o &s;oon return'd, skip't over the Wall into the Garden and fled. The next day <HI>Ralph</HI> (who knew who he was) told his Brother of it, and de&s;ir'd him to &s;peak to the young <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> not to come any more to his Hou&s;e; for if he did, he mu&s;t expect what follow'd.</P>
<P>Some days after, the Emba&s;&s;adors treated all the <HI>Franks;</HI> when <HI>Ralph</HI> be|ginning to be warm, call'd the young <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> to mind, and &s;lipping home with|out taking his leave, open'd the door &s;oftly, and found the young <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> again with his Mi&s;tri&s;s. Thereupon <HI>Ralph</HI> calling his Slaves to help him, bound his arms, and ty'd him to a Tree in the Court; and &s;o leaving him there&punc; went to bed. By and by one of <HI>Ralph</HI>'s Servants, who knew the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> &s;ell a jeering him; which &s;o incens'd the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> that he having his feet at liberty, and the fellow with|in his reach, gave him &s;uch a kick upon the bottom of his Belly, that he fir&s;t &s;woon|ed away, and then dy'd. The other Slaves &s;eeing him fall, waken'd <HI>Ralph</HI> with cries, who thereupon &s;natching up a Pi&s;tol that was charg'd with a brace of Bul|lets, &s;hot the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> into the head. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> being thus &s;lain, <HI>Ralph</HI> went in the morning to wind up the Kings Watch; and being ask'd by the King, as he was wont to do, what news in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> told him plainly what he had done, and the rea&s;on why. The King upon his report told him, he had done well according to the &s;trictne&s;s of the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> at that time was <HI>Mirza Tak&eacute;,</HI> who hated <HI>Ralph.</HI> For the <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants having pre&s;ented the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> with &s;everal Watches at a time, it happen'd that once he &s;ent to <HI>Ralph</HI> about thirty Watches toge|ther to be mended. For which the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to gratifie him, and knowing that he kept four or five Servants, and &s;even or eight Hor&s;es, &s;ent him fifteen or twenty Camels load of Straw and Barley for his Hor&s;es. But <HI>Ralph</HI> &s;light|ing &s;uch a pre&s;ent as that, <HI>Go</HI> (&s;aid he to the <HI>Athemadoulets</HI> Servant) <HI>tell thy Ma&s;ter, that I am neither a Hor&s;e nor an A&s;s, and therefore let him eat his Pre&s;ent him|&s;elf.</HI> Which me&s;&s;age &s;o provok'd the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> that he &s;tudy'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> but revenge.</P>
<P>Thereupon the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to attend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> being when he ri&s;es, and to report to him the news of the Town, told him among the re&s;t, what <HI>Ralph</HI> had done. The King reply'd, that <HI>Ralph</HI> had confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd it to him already, and that he had pardon'd him, in regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> had rea&s;on to do as he did. But the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> made an&s;wer, that <HI>Ralph</HI> had minc'd the mat|ter; and repre&s;ented the &s;tory to the King far otherwi&s;e than it was making the wor&s;t of it he could upon <HI>Ralph</HI>'s &s;ide; and the more to incite the King, he put him in mind of the fair occa&s;ion he had to force him to turn <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI> there being no way to expiate his crime, but by turning <HI>Mahometan,</HI> or &s;uffering the Law. The King thus over-rul'd, &s;ent for <HI>Ralph,</HI> told him, he was now better inform'd of the crime he had committed, and that he mu&s;t either turn <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> or dye. Thereupon the King &s;ent him to Pri&s;on. Eight days after, the King (who had a great love for him, and therefore troubl'd that he mu&s;t be con&s;train'd to put him to death, unle&s;s he would turn <HI>Mahumetan,)</HI> &s;ent for him again, and offer'd him two thou&s;and Tomans, after a powerful per&s;wa&s;ion by words, but all &s;ignify'd nothing. Upon that he &s;ent him back again to Pri|&s;on. But yet remembring that he had once approv'd the fact, he &s;ent for <HI>Ralph</HI> a &s;econd time, and offer'd him ten thou&s;and Tomans, and a Wife out of his <HI>Haram,</HI> with all her Jewels; which <HI>Ralph</HI> refus'd, with the &s;ame re&s;olu|tion as before. The King incens'd at the fiercene&s;s of his re&s;olution, deliver'd him to the Brother of the party &s;lain, to execute the Law upon him. The <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors were re&s;olv'd to have beg'd his life; but the <HI>Athema|doulet,</HI> &s;melling their de&s;ign, would not permit them Audience. However, the King commanded all the <HI>Franks,</HI> and all the <HI>Armenian</HI> Clergy to be pre&s;ent at the Execution, to &s;ave all his blood, and put him in a Coffin; he commanded al&s;o, that he &s;hould be buried at <HI>Zulpha</HI> in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Church-yard, and have a Tomb made over him.</P>
<P>Thereupon <HI>Ralph</HI> was led to the <HI>Meidan,</HI> with that triangular In&s;trument of Wood which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call a <HI>Palenk,</HI> about his neck. This <HI>Palenk</HI> was the
<PB N="201" REF="117">
cau&s;e that the Brother of the deceas'd, who was to be the Executioner, not only mi&s;s'd his fir&s;t blow, but wounded him&s;elf in the Leg, while his Skain being born off by one of the &s;ides of the triangular In&s;trument, by the force of the blow light|ed upon him&s;elf. Whereupon the people making a great &s;hout hinder'd farther execution for that time. The King being advertis'd thereof, remanded him to Pri&s;on, and after a few days &s;ent for him a third time into his pre&s;ence; but though the King offer'd him a thou&s;and Tomans, and that the Lords urg'd him to turn, though it were but for a while, and in outward appearance; yet neither threats nor promi&s;es could move the <HI>Zurickian,</HI> who was thereupon executed at the end of <HI>October,</HI> 1637.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Franks</HI> willingly contributed to rai&s;e him a Tomb; which was cover'd with a &s;mall <HI>Duomo,</HI> &s;upported with four Pillars, ten or twelve foot high. The <HI>Armenians</HI> have made him a Saint; &s;o that when they are &s;ick of a Feaver, they come and make their devotions at this Tomb; and every time they come they carry away a piece of a Stone; &s;o that the Tomb wants repairing every year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to the end the King might be the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the want of him, had told the King, that his Maje&s;ty would find no great mi&s;s of him, in regard he had a Servant who was almo&s;t as good as him&s;elf. But &s;ome few days after, the Kings Watch that he always carry'd about him, being out of order, and <HI>Ralphs</HI> Apprentice not being able to remedy the fault; the King for madne&s;s that he had been the Watchmakers death, threw the Watch at the <HI>Athemadoulets</HI> head. <HI>There,</HI> cry'd he, <HI>Dog as thou art, by thy advice I put</HI> Ralph <HI>to death, the mo&s;t skilful man of his Profe&s;&s;ion that ever will come into my Kingdom. Thou de&s;erve&s;t for thy coun&s;el, to have thy belly ript up. But I &s;wear by my Throne, that from this time forward I will never put a Chri&s;tian to death for his Religion. And I que&s;tion whether any of you would have had the &s;ame courage to have dy'd for the Law of</HI> Haly. And indeed they have been very cautious ever &s;ince; nor has any of the <HI>Franks</HI> been put to death, though they have flown out before the King in words and actions ra&s;h enough.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;ome particulars under the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SHa-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd, Son of <HI>Sha-Sefi,</HI> was no le&s;s cruel then his Father; and would be no le&s;s punctually obey'd.</P>
<P>He had two Si&s;ters, which he marri'd to two of the riche&s;t Lords of his King|dom, though of a very mean extraction. Some time after, the King under|&s;tanding that they were both with-Child, order'd Phy&s;ick to be given them to de|&s;troy the fruit of their Wombs. About three months after, he was told that they were big again; then he &s;uffer'd 'em to be brought to bed; but commanded that they &s;hould not give the Children any nouri&s;hment, but let 'em &s;tarve to death.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> caus'd the tongue of one that fill'd him Tobacco to be cut out for a word &s;pok'n idly. For the King calling for Tobacco, one of the Pages ran ha&s;tily for it to him that had it in charge, and bid him di&s;patch; who an&s;wer'd him briskly, <HI>Gebennem&eacute; &s;abreijt&eacute;,</HI> that is, <HI>to Hell, have a little pa|tience.</HI> The King being inform'd of it, commanded his tongue to be cut out. The poor man de&s;ir'd him that was the Executioner, to cut it as deep as he could in his throat, and to leave it very &s;hort; by which means he &s;poke &s;ome words muffling,</P>
<P>The people cry'd out again&s;t the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who being a per&s;on of low ex|traction, and advanc'd to that high dignity in a &s;hort time, grew &s;o proud that he contemn'd all the Lords of the Court. There was no dealing with him
<PB N="202" REF="118">
about any bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s he were fir&s;t pre&s;ented; and he paid no body with|out making &s;ome advantage of it. Every body had rea&s;on to complain; yet no per&s;on knew how to come at the King to make their complaints. At length they bethought them&s;elves of making their application to two black Eunuchs, who had the Kings ear in the night. One was call'd <HI>Aga-Saron,</HI> who was the <HI>Meter</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Wardrobe; and the other <HI>Aga-Kafour,</HI> or high Trea&s;urer. The&s;e two Eunuchs &s;eeing the King in a good humour one night, let fall certain words concerning the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and his management of affairs and thence &s;lid into a di&s;cour&s;e of his inju&s;tice, that caus'd the people to cry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut again&s;t him, and &s;peak evil of his Government. Now it happen'd one morning that the King intending to go a hunting, the Grand Ma&s;ter, who had always a large train attending him, coming to the Kings Tent, the <HI>Meter</HI> deny'd him entrance. About the &s;ame time the King came forth, and &s;eeing the <HI>Nazar,</HI> commanded his Officers to take off the Bonnet from the dead of that Dog that took Gifts from his people; and that he &s;hould &s;it three days bareheaded in the heat of the Sun, and as many nights in the Air. Afterwards he caus'd him to be chain'd about the neck and arms, and condemn'd him to perpetual impri&s;onment, with a Mamou|dy a day for his maintenance; but he dy'd for grief within eight days after he was put in pri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> being a generous Lord, and one that kept a magnificent train, was Governour of <HI>A&s;terabat.</HI> At fir&s;t he was very mild, but at la&s;t he began to exact &s;uch &s;ums from the people, that his oppre&s;&s;ions were very heavy; nor were the&s;e violences of his conceal'd from the Kings ear, who being one day drinking with &s;ome of his Lords, and &s;eeing the Ma&s;ter of his Mu&s;ick in the Room, who was a merry droll, and had always &s;ome plea&s;ant news or other to tell the King; his Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to ask him, what the people &s;aid of <HI>Jafer-Kan;</HI> adding withall, that he had made him Governour of &s;everal Pro|vinces, and had never heard any complaint of him before, but that now he was accus'd of &s;trangely tyrannizing over the people. The Mu&s;ick Ma&s;ter being a meer flatterer, and knowing that <HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> was extreamly belov'd by the King, confidently averr'd, that the Governour was fal&s;ly accus'd, and that he had always known him apter to give then to receive. There was at the &s;ame time in the Room, an <HI>Agis</HI> call'd <HI>Manouchar-Kan,</HI> lately return'd from a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> him the King al&s;o ask'd, what was his opinion of <HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> and his Government, being a per&s;on that had been long aquainted with him; to whom the <HI>Agis,</HI> thinking to plea&s;e the King, return'd the &s;ame an&s;wer, that the Mu|&s;ick Ma&s;ter had giv'n. Whereupon the King, who had been well inform'd of the <HI>Kans</HI> behaviour, turning toward the Lords that were pre&s;ent, <HI>what think you, &s;aid be, of the&s;e two Flatterers, that ab&s;olutely know the contrary to what they &s;peak?</HI> And at the &s;ame time commanded two of the Mu&s;ick Ma&s;ters teeth to be pull'd out of his mouth, and to be driv'n into the head of the <HI>Agis;</HI> which had like to have co&s;t him his life, being a very old man. As for <HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> he was di&s;grac'd for a time, but being a Per&s;on endow'd with noble qualities, valiant, generous and plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation, he was recall'd to Court, and knew &s;o well how to make his tale good, that his Maje&s;ty gave him the Government of <HI>Shemeloubo&s;tan,</HI> of which <HI>Semeran</HI> is the Capital City. <HI>Shemeloubo&s;tan</HI> &s;ignifies a Country manur'd to bear fruit. Nor is there any Province in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> that &s;o abounds in Pa&s;tures and Ca&s;tles, that daily fall to ruine.</P>
<P><HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> being re&s;tor'd to favour, the King &s;ent for &s;everal Lords of the Court to come and drink with them. He al&s;o commanded five <HI>French</HI> Artifi|cers which he had in his &s;ervice to wait upon him, a Gold&s;mith nam'd <HI>Sain,</HI> two Watchmakers <HI>Lagis</HI> and <HI>Varin,</HI> and two Musket-makers <HI>Marais</HI> and <HI>Ber|nard.</HI> After they had heated them&s;elves a little with Wine, the King drew a Ruby out from off his finger, which I &s;old him for a hundred Tomans, and a Dia|mond Jewel worth thirteen or fourteen hundred Tomans, which he gave to <HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> with whom he was whi&s;pering at the &s;ame time. Now though the <HI>Nazar</HI> were at a di&s;tance, yet without doubt &s;omewhat of the di&s;cour&s;e was heard; in&s;omuch that the Wine emboldning him, he told the King aloud, that if he would let him have but four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, he would cut all that Rab|ble to pieces. The King bid him hold his tongue and go to &s;leep; te&s;tifying
<PB N="211" REF="118">
his di&s;plea&s;ure at his di&s;cour&s;e. For the <HI>Nazar</HI> conjectur'd that the King was talking to <HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> about the incur&s;ions which the <HI>&V;sbeck Tartars</HI> often made from <HI>Me&s;hed</HI> &s;ide. As for the <HI>Franks</HI> three of the five were gone home to &s;leep, <HI>Sain, Lagis,</HI> and <HI>Bernard: Maras</HI> and <HI>Varin</HI> &s;tay'd behind in the Room. But <HI>Marais</HI> being of a humor that when he was drunk he could not hold his tongue, and having heard what the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;aid, he likewi&s;e&punc; took upon him to tell the King, that if the King wanted a General, there was none fitter to make a General then <HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> and pre&s;ently began a long repetition of his prai&s;es. The King commanded him to hold his tongue, which he did for a while, but then falling again into his former impertinencies, the King commanded him to be dragg'd out of the Room by the feet, and that they &s;hould rip up his belly. Thereupon <HI>Marais</HI> was &s;eiz'd upon by the <HI>Meter,</HI> who having a great kind|ne&s;s for the <HI>Franks,</HI> and knowing that the King had a &s;ingular love for <HI>Ma|rais,</HI> delay'd the execution of the Kings command, pulling his Cloathes off very &s;lowly; and finding that the King did not ri&s;e to go into his <HI>Haram,</HI> which is the &s;ign of no pardon to be given, he caus'd him to be dragg'd as near the per&s;on of the King as he could, thereby to try whether the King would have compa&s;&s;ion on him or no; while certain Lords took the boldne&s;s to implore the Kings mercy in his behalf. At la&s;t when the King &s;aw him dragg'd along, he commanded the Officers to let him go, and withall order'd him to put on his Cloaths again, and re&s;ume his place.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s elde&s;t Son comes very raw to the Throne; and his fir&s;t diverti&s;ement is to make &s;hort journeys into the Provinces, thereby by little and little to gain the knowledg of &s;uch things as concern him. Above all things he never fails to vi&s;it the principal Church of the <HI>Armenians</HI> at <HI>Zulpha.</HI> That which makes him &s;o curious, is his de&s;ire to &s;ee the <HI>Armenian</HI> women, who are very hand&s;om; being al&s;o further incited thereto by the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> who are glad of any recreation. And then he has a <HI>Courouk</HI> through all <HI>Zulpha,</HI> at what time all the men mu&s;t retire to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> or to their Friends at a di&s;tance. <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd went &s;everal times in that manner to <HI>Zulpha;</HI> and one day among the re&s;t, upon the report of the beauty of the Wife of the Ke|lonter <HI>Gorgia Safras,</HI> Son of Kelonter <HI>Gorgia Nazar,</HI> the King having &s;een her, lik'd her very well, and de&s;ir'd her to go along with the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> who carry'd her into the <HI>Haram,</HI> where &s;he continu'd fifteen days, and then return'd home with a fair Neck-Lace of Pearls, which the King gave her when &s;he went away.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd, he was a man too much given to drink, and too much govern'd by his pa&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e he was a lover of ju&s;tice, and very magnificent and generous to Strangers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the misfortune of Mahomet <HI>Beg</HI> in the reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the &s;econd.</HEAD>
<P>MAhomet <HI>Beg</HI> was born at <HI>Tauris,</HI> the Son of a Taylor, who bred him a Scho|lar. He had a quick apprehen&s;ion, and was naturally enclin'd to vertue; and being de&s;irous to advance him&s;elf in the world, he had the good luck to ob|tain the employment of <HI>Major-Ba&s;hi,</HI> or chief of the E&s;&s;ayers and Refiners of Mo|ney, who has a power to vi&s;it all places where money is coyn'd. After that, he became acquainted with the <HI>Aila Verdi Beg,</HI> or Mr. <HI>God&s;gift,</HI> the Kings chief Hunt&s;man, by the title of <HI>Mert-Shekar-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who gladly pre&s;ented him to the King, to whom the King was very thankful, &s;o &s;oon as he had found the noble Qua|lities of the per&s;on he had pre&s;ented. Thereupon &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Mahomet Ali-Beg,</HI> grand Ma&s;ter of the Kings Hou&s;e dy'd, the King be&s;tow'd that Employment upon <HI>Maho|met Beg,</HI> who not only gain'd the favour of his Maje&s;ty, but the good will of all the Lords of the Court. He had a great re&s;pect for them all, without medling with any of their employments, and &s;uppre&s;t his revengeful &s;pirit, not finding it &s;ea&s;onable as yet to di&s;clo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Kalife Sultan</HI> at that time <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> hapning to dye, the King conferr'd that place upon <HI>Mahomet Beg,</HI> who at fir&s;t behav'd him&s;elf in that employment to the &s;atisfaction of all men. He apply'd him&s;elf particularly to the &s;earching out of Mines; for there had a report ran among the people for many years, that if certain mountains nine or ten miles from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> toward the We&s;t were well digg'd into, there might be found &s;tore of Gold, Silver and Copper. To which purpo&s;e he made u&s;e of a <HI>Norman,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>La Chapelle de Han,</HI> who vanted at that time to have great skill in Chymi&s;try, Mines and Minerals, for which rea&s;on he was recommended by the Governor of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> then at <HI>Casbin</HI> with the King, who pre&s;ently &s;ent him back again to the Governour to furni&s;h him with all things nece&s;&s;ary for his Expences, and for the work which he undertook in the Mountains. Thither went <HI>La Chapelle,</HI> and after fifteen days toyl return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> with two or three hunder'd weight of earth, and &s;et up fur|naces to draw out the metal. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> was &s;o wi&s;e as to give order to the Governour of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and three or four more per&s;ons of Quality to overview the Norman, to &s;ee that he play'd no foul play. But though there was not &s;o much as a half peny worth of &s;ilver in all the earth from the bottom to the top, though the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> watch'd him &s;o narrowly as they did, he made a &s;hift to &s;huf|fle in an <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> among the earth, as it was in the furnace without being perceiv'd. Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to whom it was carry'd, pre&s;ently found out the cheat, though he took no notice of it, hoping to make better u&s;e of the Norman in other things; only he forbad him to dig any more in that place, in regard the expence would exceed the profit.</P>
<P><HI>La Chapelle,</HI> who was very skilful at putting off his merchandize, and one who knew to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the lea&s;t &s;mackering that he might perhaps have in Mechanicks, and the power of Motion, had the cunning to amu&s;e the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> for ten years together, being a pa&s;&s;ion ate Lover of new Inventions; and the better to infinuate him&s;elf into the Kings favour a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf the Invention of &s;everal Rarities which he &s;hew'd the King, who thereupon allow'd him a very hand&s;ome pen&s;ion. Thus encourag'd, he undertook to ca&s;t Canons, bring the water to the top of the Kings hou&s;e, and &s;everal other things, yet when all his de&s;igns fail'd for want of Art, and that he found he could do no more good in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> re&s;olving for <HI>India,</HI> he dy'd at <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> mi&s;&s;ing of Gold and Silver Mines, applg'd him&s;elf to the di&s;|covery of Copper Mines, wherein he was more fortunate; for in tho&s;e Mines he al&s;o found veins of Azure, of which there is a great quantity con&s;um'd in painting the <HI>Grote&s;co Flouri&s;hes</HI> upon the Ceilings and Arches of their Hou&s;es. He al&s;o found out a Mine of Lead near <HI>Yerde:</HI> and being &s;till upon new di&s;coveries, he found out
<PB N="213" REF="119">
a Mine of Talk, Stone, Allum, and Coles, but of neither &s;o good as in other Coun|tries. He was &s;o ob&s;tinate in the &s;earch of Metals, that if any per&s;on had an occa|&s;ion to &s;peak with him, let him be never &s;o bu&s;ie upon never &s;o important affairs, it was enough to bring him &s;ome &s;tones of a &s;uppo&s;ed Mine, or &s;ometing rare ei|ther for Colour, Figure or Weight. He al&s;o gave full power to them that brought him any tidings of a Mine to go to the place, and to pre&s;s the Countrymen from their labour to dig in the Mountains and break up rocks: and if they found no|thing he ca&s;t the fault upon the ignorance of the Labourers.</P>
<P>He al&s;o apply'd him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of Mechanic Motions. He would have found an Invention, whereby the half Vail that hangs in the Kings <HI>Megeler,</HI> or Council Chamber, and is drawn to and fro by certain Officers in the Summer, to gather the cool Air, &s;hould have bin made by Engine-work. Then he took a fan|cy for water Engines, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary thing in the world for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to relieve the drowth of the Country, but wanting nece&s;&s;aries, as Beams, Rafters, Wheel|work, Cordage and Iron, he could not begin tho&s;e Engines, the figures whereof <HI>La Chapelle</HI> had left him in a Book.</P>
<P>But as Mahomet <HI>Beg</HI> was &s;tudious in the&s;e things, &s;o was he Ambitious and Re|vengeful to that height that he could not ob&s;erve a moderation in his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e that had given him any di&s;ta&s;te. In his height of Pa&s;&s;ion he caus'd &s;everal <HI>Kans</HI> to be depriv'd of their Provinces, and by confi&s;cating their E&s;tates reduc'd them to utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivan</HI> had a Son who was a lovely and a well proportion'd Gentle|man, and always attended at the Kings Elbow. One day that the King was drinking with &s;ome Lords, he commanded the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivans</HI> Son to carry a Gold Cup full of Wine to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> who perceiving that he had enough already, made a &s;ign with his eye to the young Lord to return it back. The young Lord pa&s;&s;ing by the King told him ingeniou&s;ly that the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> had no de&s;ire to drink, whereupon the King commanded him to go and powre the Wine into his be&s;ome. As the one was oblig'd to obey; the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> was forc'd to &s;uf|fer, and to permit the young man to open his bo&s;ome and powre down the Wine; for not daring to &s;hew his anger, he was forc'd to di&s;&s;emble the be&s;t he could for that time. But having re&s;olv'd to revenge the affront upon the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivan</HI> Father of the young Lord, who had only done what the King command|ed him, he re&s;olv'd to lay hold upon the opportunity that pre&s;ented it &s;elf, know|ing that there were &s;everal complaints come again&s;t him from the <HI>Armenians</HI> of <HI>Erivan.</HI> Thereupon the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> &s;ends for the <HI>Kelonter,</HI> encourages him in his &s;uit, and gives him in&s;tructions how to proceed. To this end Mahomet <HI>Beg</HI> appoints him to meet him &s;uch an hour at the Kings Stables, whither the King pre&s;ently coming, the <HI>Kelonter</HI> threw him&s;elf at the Kings feet, and be|&s;ought him for Ju&s;tice again&s;t the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Erivans</HI> oppre&s;&s;ions: while Mahomet <HI>Beg</HI> fail'd not to heap up aggravations again&s;t the Governour, and the King, though he had heard but one &s;ide, as ea&s;ily condemn'd him upon the Accu&s;ation of the <HI>Kelonter</HI> and his Prime Mini&s;ter. Thereupon an Officer of the Kings, call'd <HI>Negef-Couli-Beg,</HI> a man of a quick and active &s;pirit was commanded to go in all ha&s;te, and &s;eize upon the Per&s;on of the <HI>Kan.</HI> Who being come to <HI>Erivan</HI> found him upon his &s;eat of Ju&s;tice, confi&s;cating and condemning to fine and Corporal puni&s;hment a near Kin&s;man of the <HI>Kelonters.</HI> The Me&s;&s;enger boldly entered into the <HI>Megeler</HI> or Council Chamber, goes directly to the <HI>Kan,</HI> told him he was the Kings pri&s;ner, and gave him a blow with his fi&s;t upon the neck, about which he was to wear the Triangle of great thick pieces of wood already de&s;crib'd, into which the neck is enclos'd, while the Arms and Hands of the Pri&s;ner are put through another piece of wood that cro&s;&s;es the Triangle, which is a great pain to the Pri&s;ner. Thus was the <HI>Kan</HI> carry'd night and day to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but when he came there the King &s;hew'd him more mercy, and allowed him his hou&s;e for a pri&s;on, yet not &s;uffering him to go to the Bath, nor to &s;have his hair, nor to &s;tir out of the Apartment where his women were. The&s;e are penalties impos'd upon tho&s;e that fall into di&s;grace at Court, whom the King &s;huts up in their hou&s;es, in|tending no &s;everer puni&s;hment. For the <HI>Kan</HI> being belov'd by the King was re|&s;tor'd to his favour, and to his former charge of &s;uperintendant of the Kings <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI></P>

Neither did this fright'n others from bearing up again&s;t the Power of Mahomet <HI>Beg,</HI> though every one had not the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. For ill it far'd with the Go|vernour of <HI>Schiras,</HI> who was call'd <HI>Mirza Haddi.</HI> He was a per&s;on of great wealth and knowledge, and one day in Council took upon him to tell <HI>Mahomed Beg,</HI> that he was not of his opinion, and withall to lay before him his defects, and ill conduct. But the Prime Mini&s;ter &s;o deeply lay'd to heart the boldne&s;s of <HI>Mirza Haddi,</HI> that he re&s;olv'd to revenge him&s;elf by all means imaginable. He &s;uborn'd fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and other per&s;ons to make complaints before him of the Governour of <HI>Schiras.</HI> There was a nece&s;&s;ity for the party accus'd to appear before <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> as his Judge, but the Governor tru&s;ting to his Innocence, nere minded the rage of his ad|ver&s;ary, not believing he could receive any injury from him. In the mean time <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> inform'd the King what he pleas'd him&s;elf, and overpow'ring him by his authority, confi&s;cated all <HI>Mirza Haddi's</HI> E&s;tate, and &s;ent him to pri&s;on to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who was call'd <HI>I&s;maet Beg.</HI> When he came there they hung him upon Tenter-hooks by the feet again&s;t the wall, and drub'd him &s;o long; that he was forc'd to be carri'd into another Room upon a Slaves back. His Lieu|tenant and an Eunuch, that had bin his Trea&s;urer, were &s;erv'd in the &s;ame &s;awce, and all three put into a high Chamber that &s;erv'd in&s;tead of a pri&s;on. His Vizier or Lieutenant was releas'd in a &s;hort while, but <HI>Mirza Haddi</HI> and his Eunuch were &s;till kept clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is the manner of his revenging him&s;elf upon <HI>Mir-Ka&s;&s;em-Beg,</HI> the <HI>Deroga,</HI> or Provo&s;t of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> le&s;s remarkable. While <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> was only <HI>Majer-Ba|&s;hi,</HI> there was &s;ome gold Plate &s;toll'n out of the Kings Kitchin. Thereupon the <HI>Deroga</HI> &s;ent his Officers to &s;eize upon all the Gold&s;miths in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that knew nothing of the matter, as being utterly Innocent of the Robbery. In the mean time he put them all in pri&s;on, and lockt them clo&s;e up, intimating to them that he was re&s;olv'd not to relea&s;e them without a good &s;um of money. The poor Gold&s;miths thus ill us'd, apply'd them&s;elves to the <HI>Majer-Ba&s;hi;</HI> who &s;ent his Of|ficers to intreat the <HI>Deroga</HI> to con&s;ider that the Gold-&s;miths were innocent of the Robbery, and that being in &s;ome manner under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Mayer-Ba&s;hi,</HI> as being Artificers in Gold and Silver, he ought not to refu&s;e to di&s;charge them at his reque&s;t. But the <HI>Deroga</HI> not &s;eeing the money come, bid the Officers of Ma|homet <HI>Beg</HI> tell their Ma&s;ter that he knew what belong'd to his employment, and further, &s;aid he, <HI>Let the Taylors Son meddle with his own bu&s;ine&s;s; tell him withall,</HI> added he, <HI>that if he plea&s;es I will &s;hew him his Si&s;ter's drawers.</HI> For a little before the <HI>Deroga</HI> had by his Spies &s;urpriz'd her toying in a Garden with two young Lords, from whom he &s;queez'd a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> not powerful enough then to pro&s;ecute his revenge, let it &s;leep, but when he came to the height of preferment, he remember'd the <HI>Deroga,</HI> and bethought him&s;elf which way to ruin him. Nor was it long ere an opportunity offer'd it &s;elf. For there being a report that the Enemy appear'd about <HI>Candahar,</HI> a Frontier Town of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> upon the <HI>Mogulls</HI> Territories, the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> advis'd the King to rai&s;e a good number of Souldiers about <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as being lu&s;ty nimble fel|lows and us'd to labour, and to &s;end them to <HI>Candahar,</HI> to be ready again&s;t all accidents. The King having an entire confidence in the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> order'd him to lo&s;e no time, but to commit the management of the Levies to &s;uch per&s;ons as had perfect knowledge of the plain Country. Then <HI>Mahomet Beg,</HI> &s;tudying his re|venge, told the King that there was no per&s;on fitter for the employment than the <HI>Deroga, Mir Ka&s;&s;embeg,</HI> who according to his cruel and covetous humor, &s;oon abus'd his Commi&s;&s;ion, the thing which he, who had procur'd it, chiefly de&s;ir'd. For whereas the King intended that none &s;hould be enroll'd but tho&s;e that were wil|ling, the <HI>Deroga</HI> forc'd every body, e&s;pecially the Sons of the riche&s;t Farmers, who rather than part with their Sons gave the <HI>Deroga</HI> his own demands to &s;pare them. When <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> had got matter enough again&s;t the <HI>Deroga,</HI> he underhand &s;tirr'd up the Country people to make their complaint, giving them to under&s;tand that it was contrary to the Kings intention to have them tormented in that manner; that his Commi&s;&s;ion was only to li&s;t tho&s;e that would go of their own accord. The Villages ea&s;ily encourag'd, &s;ent their Deputies to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> whom he kindly recei|v'd and pre&s;ented the &s;ame hour to the King. His Maje&s;ty having heard them, and <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> having &s;econded their complaint, the King order'd that they
<PB N="215" REF="120">
&s;hould make an exact li&s;t of what the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Deroga</HI> had robb'd them of. <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> lo&s;t no time, but by vertue of his Authority and the Kings command, &s;ent his Officers into all the Villages to take the Oath of eve|ry Country-man to the end they &s;hould declare the truth, under the penalty of a Fine and Corporal puni&s;hment, of what had been exacted from them to the ut|mo&s;t <HI>Shayet.</HI> This Oath was to be put in Paper, &s;ign'd by every one that made it, in the&s;e words, <HI>Let my head be confi&s;cated to the King, and my goods to his</HI> Divan, <HI>if I do not punctually the Order of his Maje&s;ty.</HI> The accompt being made of all the money for which they had compounded with the <HI>Deroga,</HI> it was pre&s;ented by <HI>Mahomet Beg,</HI> who aggravated the Tyranny of the <HI>Deroga,</HI> and repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty that for thirty years he had thus devour'd the Territories of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Thereupon by the command of the King, who was then at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the <HI>Deroga</HI> was to be carry'd into the <HI>Meydan,</HI> and being ty'd up by the heels to receive a certain number of Ba&s;tinado's upon the feet for &s;o many Fridays one after another; and moreover the nerves of his heels were to be cut, and his ankles to be boar'd tho|rough. The Kings command being thus &s;eal'd, Mahomet <HI>Beg</HI> committed the ex|ecution thereof to his tru&s;ty In&s;trument <HI>Negef-Couli-Beg,</HI> who coming to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> a&s;&s;embl'd the chief of the City, together with the <HI>Vizir</HI> or Governour, and the <HI>Deroga</HI> or Provo&s;t, who thought of nothing; being met, before they broak open the Kings Seal they made a publick Prayer for the pro&s;perity of the King; which being ended, the <HI>Vizir</HI> open'd the Letter and read it with a loud voice. When the <HI>Vizir</HI> came to read the Sentence again&s;t the <HI>Deroga,</HI> he was &s;eiz'd with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, at what time <HI>Negef-Coult-Beg</HI> coming to the <HI>Deroga,</HI> and &s;triking him upon the Neck with his fi&s;t, threw him down under his Hor&s;es feet, and caus'd him to be bound according to cu&s;tom. Immediately he was hurri'd to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where he receiv'd &s;o many Ba&s;tinado's upon the &s;oles of his feet that his nayls fell off. The next Friday they brought him to the &s;ame place, where they repeated the &s;ame Execution, and boar'd his ankles. The <HI>Deroga</HI> being very ancient, his pains put him into &s;uch a condition as mov'd <HI>Negef-Couli-Beg</HI> him&s;elf to compa&s;&s;ion, who wrote pre&s;ently to Court, that the continuance of &s;o much torment, would infal|libly be the death of the old man. Upon that the King order'd that there &s;hould no more be done to him; only that he &s;hould be &s;hut up in the inner part of his Hou&s;e with his Wives, depriving him of his employment, but leaving him his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mahomet Beg,</HI> not having yet compleated the revenge he &s;ought, was re|&s;olv'd after he had thus tormented him to deprive him, al&s;o of his E&s;tate. To which purpo&s;e he advanc'd to the Office of <HI>Deroga,</HI> a <HI>Georgian</HI> Renegado who was call'd <HI>Padada-Beg,</HI> whom he taught all the tricks imaginable to pick the peoples-pockets. The de&s;ign of <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> in this, was to let the King under|&s;tand, that if the new <HI>Deroga</HI> could heap up &s;uch a &s;um of money in five or &s;ix months, what a prodigious &s;um mu&s;t <HI>Mir-Ka&s;&s;embeg</HI> have heap'd up in &s;o many years. In &s;hort, the new <HI>Deroga</HI> in&s;tructed and encourag'd by <HI>Mahomet Beg,</HI> le|vy'd unju&s;tly &s;uch a va&s;t number of fines, committed &s;o many extortions and ra|pines upon the people, that at the end of &s;ix months the people began to tumult at the Palace gate. The <HI>Divan-Bequi,</HI> who is the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice, took the peoples part; whereupon <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> perceiving he had been too ha&s;ty in his de&s;ign to be reveng'd upon the <HI>Divan Bequi,</HI> who had cro&s;s'd his de&s;igns, one morning caus'd &s;everal files of Mu&s;queteers to be drawn up at the Kings <HI>Haram.</HI> The King &s;urpriz'd at the &s;ight, <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> told him that his Maje&s;ty was not &s;afe &s;o long as the <HI>Divan Bequi</HI> &s;tirr'd up the people to Rebellion: which &s;o in|cens'd the King, that he caus'd the Groom Porter to go immediately and pull out the <HI>Divan Bequi's</HI> eyes, which was immediately done; nor did the old man &s;ay any more, but with his face all be&s;mear'd with his own goar, de&s;ir'd the &s;ervant upon who&s;e arms he lean'd, to turn him toward <HI>Mecca</HI> that he might pray for the pro&s;perity of the King. All his goods were confi&s;cated and brought into the Trea|&s;ury; but <HI>Mer Ka&s;&s;em-beg</HI> &s;till enjoy'd his, thought he was forc'd to &s;pend the remain|der of his days in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf &s;till in the Kings favour, and had remov'd all tho&s;e per&s;ons from the Court that had no kindne&s;s for him, and was indifferently &s;afe, till <HI>Mir-Tchekar-Ba&s;hi</HI> another favourite, whom the King highly lov'd, began
<PB N="216" REF="121">
to make head again&s;t him. The&s;e two haughty &s;pirits would not give an inch one to another: and both equally &s;trove to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Kings favour, to have the di&s;|po&s;al of Affairs. <HI>Mir-Tehekar-Ba&s;hi,</HI> who had brought <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> into Fa|vour, being the elder pretended a re&s;pect due to his years, and <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> pre|tended more due from him by rea&s;on of his place. During this conte&s;t ran a re|port of a rebellion upon <HI>Georgia</HI> &s;ide. Whereupon the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> per&s;waded the King to fend <HI>Mir-Tehekar-Ba&s;hi,</HI> lately made <HI>Koular Aga&s;i</HI> or General of the Slaves toward <HI>Georgia,</HI> that &s;o he might remove his Rival from Court. The Fa|vourite &s;ets forward with a flying Camp, but not finding any Enemy that oppos'd him, wrote back to the King that he &s;aw no appearance of an Enemy, and that therefore it was a needle&s;s&punc; thing to tire the Souldiers in a Country where there was no face of War, and begg'd his Maje&s;ties leave to return. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> on the other &s;ide labour'd to hinder his return by preaching to the King the advan|tages of the &s;tay of tho&s;e forces in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>In this interim the <HI>&V;sbek Tartars</HI> had made inroads upon the Frontiers of <HI>Ca|ra&s;&s;an,</HI> and had &s;lain &s;everal of <HI>Manoutcheks</HI> people, who was governor of the Pro|vince. <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> who was his Kin&s;man, gave the King to under&s;tand that the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Cora&s;&s;an</HI> had behav'd him&s;elf valiantly, but conceal'd the defeat of the <HI>Kan.</HI> On the other &s;ide the <HI>Koular Aga&s;i</HI> &s;ent Letter upon Letter to the King, but perceiving that none of them came to the Kings hands, he &s;ent to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> one of his di&s;creete&s;t and mo&s;t tru&s;ty &s;ervants, who coming to Court intermix'd him|&s;elf among the re&s;t of the Lackeys. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> &s;pying an unknown face, and being always mi&s;tru&s;tful, demanded who he was? To whom the Me&s;&s;enger an|&s;wer'd that he was a poor Souldier upon the frontiers of the Kingdom, who be|cau&s;e he could not get his pay there was come to Court to &s;ee if he could there get any recompence for his &s;ervice: upon which reply the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> took no farther notice of him. Pre&s;ently after, the young man meeting the <HI>Meter</HI> told him he had Letters of importance to deliver into the Kings own hard, of which the <HI>Meter</HI> giving notice to the King, the me&s;&s;enger was immediately call'd in. The King having read the Letters which di&s;cover'd to him what the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> had conceal'd from him touching the no nece&s;&s;ity of keeping forces upon the Frontiers of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the lo&s;s which the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Kora&s;&s;an</HI> had receiv'd, tran&s;ported with choler again&s;t his prime Mini&s;ter, &s;ent for him, and after he had mo&s;t bloodily revil'd and reproach'd him, he was within a little of killing him with his own hands. But the <HI>Nazar</HI> and &s;ome other Lords there&punc;pre&s;ent took the boldne&s;s to repre&s;ent to the King the long &s;ervices which <HI>Mahomet Beg</HI> had done the Kingdom, and that &s;ince his Maje&s;ty had rais'd him from the du&s;t to the highe&s;t honours of the King|dom, it would not be for his honour to de&s;troy at one blow a per&s;on that he had lov'd, and might &s;till be u&s;eful to him. This di&s;cour&s;e &s;omewhat appeas'd the King, &s;o that he only gave him in cu&s;tody to the <HI>Nazar.</HI> Three days after the King exil'd him to <HI>Kom,</HI> with all his Family, not permitting him to &s;have him&s;elf&punc; go to the Bath, or to come abroad. This Exilement la&s;ted for &s;everal years. But my Letters from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the year 1674. enform'd me that <HI>Sha-Solyman,</HI> the pre&s;ent King, has re&s;tor'd him to his Primier Dignity, and that he &s;till governs as <HI>Athema|doulet,</HI> the King finding no man more capable than him&s;elf.</P>

<P>BEtween <HI>Cape Ja&s;que,</HI> and <HI>Cape Guadel</HI> which are the two mo&s;t Southern points of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there lies a mountainous and mer&s;hie Country, which extends it &s;elf from the Ocean toward the Province of <HI>Kerman,</HI> and in &s;everal places is inac|ce&s;&s;ible. It is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by three petty Princes, the one a Mahumetan, the other two toward the Ea&s;t both Idolaters. The fir&s;t is the mo&s;t potent of the three, and neare&s;t to the Province of <HI>Ormus.</HI> He al&s;o a&s;&s;umes the title of Prince of <HI>Ja&s;que,</HI> as his Ance&s;tors did before him.

And indeed during the reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> who knew how to make him&s;elf fear'd, the Prince of <HI>Ja&s;que</HI> pay'd his tri|bute very orderly. But <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> &s;ucceeding his Grandfather very young, this tributary Prince &s;hook off his yoak, and refus'd to pay.

But at length after he had refus'd to pay for &s;ome years, the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Ormus</HI> pretending the Country to be under his Juri&s;diction, and that the Kings honour was concern'd in the Princes refu&s;al, incited <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> to &s;end forces again&s;t him to reduce him to obedience. The King granted the Com|mi&s;&s;ion to him that had undertaken the bu&s;ine&s;s: who pre&s;ently gathering toge|ther an Army of 20000 men, the mo&s;t part Hor&s;e, thought to have &s;urpriz'd his Enemy. To which purpo&s;e that he might take the neare&s;t way, he march'd direct|ly toward <HI>Cape Ja&s;que.</HI> But as it was the &s;horte&s;t cut, it was the mo&s;t dangerous&punc; in&s;omuch that the <HI>Kan,</HI> who hunted all the way he march'd, according to the cu&s;tom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> had the misfortune to fall into a bogg, where he was &s;tifl'd, to|gether with 20 or 30 hor&s;emen more. The death of the <HI>Kan</HI> being divulg'd, the Army retreated back again: but as &s;oon as the King receiv'd the news, he &s;ent the Brother of the deceas'd <HI>Kan</HI> to &s;ucceed him. In the mean while the Rebel Prince believing within him&s;elf, that he was not to be thus at quiet, and expecting to be attack'd by the new <HI>Kan,</HI> &s;tood upon his guard. And indeed the new <HI>Kan</HI> march'd with all the &s;peed he could, and enter'd the territories of the rebellious Prince, but being beat'n was forc'd to make more ha&s;te back again to <HI>Ormus,</HI> with the lo&s;s of an abundance of men.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Ja&s;que</HI> puft up with this &s;ucce&s;s, did not believe that the <HI>Per&s;i|ans</HI> would be &s;o ha&s;ty to come again: and thereupon he re&s;olv'd upon a Voyage for <HI>Mecca</HI> to give the Prophet thanks for his Victory. To which end he embarqu'd at the neare&s;t place he could to <HI>Cape Ja&s;que,</HI> thence to make &s;ail toward <HI>Arabia.</HI> But the Governor of <HI>Kan</HI> under&s;tanding his de&s;ign by his &s;pies, way-laid him by Sea, took him and&punc;brought him to <HI>Ormus.</HI> At that time the heats being exce&s;|&s;ive, the Governour was retir'd, according to cu&s;tome, to the Mountains &s;ome ten or twelve Leagues from the City, whither the Prince was carry'd and brought to the <HI>Kans</HI> tent. But while the <HI>Kan</HI> was expecting the return&punc;of the Me&s;&s;enger which he had &s;ent to the King for orders what to do with the Pri&s;oner, the Princes wife hearing of her husbands misfortune, and being a woman of a manlike cou|rage, taking along with her about five or &s;ix hundred hor&s;e, with little noi&s;e and by long marches &s;he at length fell unawares upon the <HI>Kan</HI> about midnight, kill'd him with her own hand, cut in pieces the greate&s;t part of his men, whom &s;he found a&s;leep, carry'd away ten or twelve of his wives, and &s;et her husband at li|berty in &s;pite of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who had not time to rally them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The news of this defeat coming to Court, the King being highly incens'd, &s;ent away the third Brother to be governour of <HI>Ormus,</HI> with &s;pecial command to the
<PB N="218" REF="122">
Governours of <HI>Schiras, Lar</HI> and <HI>Kerman</HI> forthwith to rai&s;e 30000 hor&s;e to revenge the affront and reduce the Rebel. The <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Ormus</HI> march'd at the head of that Army, and gave Battel, but the Prince being &s;uccour'd by the other two Idola|trous Princes his neighbours, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were again beaten. Only the Prince of <HI>Ja&s;que</HI> lo&s;t his Lieutenant General, a valiant Captain, and a very good Soul|dier.</P>
<P>The King under&s;tanding that the Lieutenant General was the <HI>Kans</HI> Pri&s;oner, gave him leave to do with him what he would, in revenge of his Brothers death: who thereupon devis'd the mo&s;t cruel torments that ever were heard of. For he fir&s;t caus'd the body of the Lieutenant General to be larded with lighted Candles, and then &s;etting him upon a Camel order'd him to be led &s;oftly about the &s;treets eve|ry day in the very heat of noon. A torment almo&s;t in&s;ufferable, which the hero|ic Indian neverthele&s;s endur'd with an invincible courage. After the <HI>Kan</HI> had tormented him in this manner three days together, the chief of the <HI>Holland</HI> Com|pany and other &s;trange Merchants abhorring &s;o much cruelty, begg'd of the <HI>Kan</HI> to &s;urcea&s;e his rigour, who readily granted them their reque&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ob&s;ervations upon the reign of <HI>Sha-Soliman</HI> the pre&s;ent King.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALi-Couli-Kan</HI> had bin three or four times exil'd from the Court, for &s;peaking with two much liberty. For he was bold and could not keep his tongue between his teeth. For which rea&s;on he was call'd the Kings Lyon, who was wont to chain him up when he had no occa&s;ion for him, and to let him loo&s;e when he had any bu&s;ine&s;s for him to do. The la&s;t time he was exil'd, he was kept five or &s;ix years in a Fortre&s;s out of which he had never &s;tirr'd: But one day, having a &s;mooth tongue, he over-per&s;waded the Commander to give him leave to go a hunting with him. When he return'd, with the help of &s;ome of his &s;ervants, he fell upon the Commander, and gave him &s;o many Ba&s;tinadoe's upon the feet, that he had like to have kill'd him: telling him withall, that it was to teach him his duty, not to let a man go that the King had committed to his charge. <HI>Sha-Sephi,</HI> though very young, hearing of this, and de&s;irous to &s;ee <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the Grandees to hinder his return, commanded him to be &s;et at liberty, and that he &s;hould have a better allowance to live upon. Two or three days after, the King &s;itting in Council, the whole A&s;&s;embly was amaz'd to &s;ee <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan</HI> enter, who approaching his Maje&s;ty with a profound reverence, told him, that the Lyon being now let loo&s;e was humbly come to ki&s;s his hands. Thereupon the King fell a laughing, and ca&s;ting a favourable glance upon him told him he had done well. Nor was it long ere the King finding him no le&s;s plea&s;ant in conver&s;ation, then a valiant and expert Captain, made him Generali&s;&s;imo of his Armies, as he had bin in the reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas.</HI></P>
<P>When the Court &s;aw <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan</HI> &s;o well receiv'd, every one then labour'd to te&s;tifie their joy for his return. They &s;ent him Hor&s;es, Mules, Camels, rich Carpets, and every thing fit to furni&s;h a Lords hou&s;e. But all this while he wanted money, which becau&s;e he could not meet with among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he was forc'd to have recour&s;e to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> of whom he de&s;ir'd to borrow &s;ive or &s;ix hunder'd Tomans. As for the <HI>Kalemer</HI> he would have had the &s;um lent, but the re&s;t would not. Thereupon the King taking a walk to <HI>Zulpha, Ali-Couli-Kan</HI> put it into his head to go and &s;ee the great Cathedral belonging to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> where &s;everal Bi&s;hops with &s;everal Monks re&s;ide. The King entring into the Church, where the Bi&s;hop &s;tood ready at the head of the Clergy to receive him, and &s;eeing all things new and &s;trange, as coming but lately out of the womens <HI>Haram,</HI> ask'd his fa|vourite what &s;ort of people tho&s;e were clad in &s;uch an extraordinary manner. <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan</HI> told him they were Devils, <HI>Devils!</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>What!</HI> added he, <HI>do&s;t bring me into a hou&s;e of Devils?</HI> The King thus incens'd again&s;t the <HI>Armenians,</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="122">
re&s;olv'd to force 'em to turn <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> But <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan,</HI> being a <HI>Georgian,</HI> repenting that he had rais'd the Kings indignation to &s;o high a pitch, and not be|lieving it would be any advantage to him for the <HI>Armenians</HI> to turn <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> contented him&s;elf only with frighting them, which was enough to bring the <HI>Arme|nians</HI> upon their knees, and to make them come and beg the Interce&s;&s;ion of his authority. Which favour, as he order'd it, co&s;t the <HI>Armenians</HI> ten thou&s;and To|mans to the King, and four or five thou&s;and Tomans to his Favourite.</P>
<P>The 23. of <HI>September</HI> 1677. the King made a Cavalcade, then which there could be nothing imagin'd more magnificent. All the riche&s;t Furniture was brought out of the Exchequer into the <HI>Meydan.</HI> The golded buckets to water the Hor&s;es. The golden Fat out of which they take the water, together with buckles, harne&s;s and nails of gold, to which the Hor&s;es are ty'd. After the King had play'd at Mall, as I have already de&s;crib'd, and had al&s;o &s;hot at the Goblet upon the top of the Ma&s;t in the middle of the <HI>Meydan,</HI> he went and &s;ate in the <HI>Divan,</HI> which is over the Gate call'd <HI>Ali Capi,</HI> where he had the pa&s;time to &s;ee Lyons, Bulls, Bears, Tygers and Rams fight. But that which was mo&s;t admirable, was to &s;ee a man &s;tand upright upon the Saddle while the hor&s;e ran full &s;peed, which he did three times the whole length of the <HI>Meydan.</HI> The fir&s;t time, 'tis true, he fell but the two la&s;t times he &s;tood firm.</P>
<P>One day the &s;ame <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan&punc;</HI>pre&s;ented two hand&s;om Youths to the King, which had both delicate voices. The King hearing them &s;ing, was very much troubl'd that he could not make u&s;e of them in his <HI>Haram,</HI> which <HI>Alli-Couli-Kan</HI> ob&s;erving, &s;ent for a <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon, and promis'd him a great reward if he could cut the youths and &s;ave their lives. The Chirurgeon for lucre of a large recompence, cut them both and cur'd 'em very well. Which done, <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan,</HI> pre&s;ented the two youths to the King, who was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee them, but was well pleas'd that he had got two &s;uch new attendants in his <HI>Haram.</HI> But &s;ee the reward of &s;uch a wicked action. <HI>Ali-Couli-Kan</HI> dy'd &s;oon after. The Chi|rurgeon never was pay'd: and being advis'd to pre&s;ent a Petition to the King by the Meter, the Meter ask'd him whether he would turn <HI>Mahometan:</HI> which when the Chirurgeon deny'd to do, the Meter bid him be gone like a Ra&s;cal, telling him withall that he did not think the Religion of the Chri&s;tians had permitted &s;uch acts of villany. The two youths were born at <HI>Ca&s;han,</HI> and had both Fathers and Mothers, and were promis'd in Marriage. When their Parents heard of it, they came to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to weep over their Children. Which the King ob&s;erving, to appea&s;e their &s;orrow, gave them a Pen&s;ion during life.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Government of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Government of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is purely De&s;potick or Tyrannical. For the King has the &s;ole power of life and death over all his Subjects, independant from his Council, and without any Trials or Law-proceedings. He can put to what death he plea&s;es the chief Lords of the Kingdom, no man daring to di&s;pute the rea&s;on, nor is there any Soveraign in the world more ab&s;olute then the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The King decea&s;ing and leaving Male I&s;&s;ue behind him, the Elde&s;t a&s;cends the Throne, while his Brothers are kept in the <HI>Haram,</HI> and their eyes are put out: and if there be the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any contrivance again&s;t the King, they are forth|with put to death without any farther examination. And not only they, but the Children al&s;o of the Kings Brothers and Si&s;ters. I remember when I fir&s;t travell'd in|to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they were not &s;o rigorous, but were contented to move a red hot iron to and fro before their eyes. But <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> perceiving his command had been neg|ligently executed, and that the poor unhappy Princes had &s;ome &s;ight left them
<PB N="220" REF="123">
he order'd their eyes to be digg'd out of their heads. <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI>'s cruelty went yet farther, for he &s;par'd not his Elde&s;t Son <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> the lawful Heir to his Throne, ordering one of his Eunuchs to move an Iron before his eyes, no man being able to tell the rea&s;on. But the Eunuch compa&s;&s;ionating the young Prince, did indeed move an Iron, but not a red hot Iron before his Eyes, and teaching him to counterfeit him&s;elf blind, pre&s;erv'd his &s;ight till his Father lay upon his death-bed: at which time his Father was very penitent, for having put out the eyes of his Elde&s;t Son, to whom the Throne of right belong'd. The Eunuch &s;eeing the King &s;o &s;adly afflicted and ready to give up the gho&s;t, a&s;&s;ur'd him that he would re&s;tore the Prince to his &s;ight, and to comfort him at his death, brought the Prince with perfect eyes to the bed &s;ide. The &s;ight of which pro|long'd the Kings life till next day; and gave him time to command all the Gran|dees of the Court to obey <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, as his lawful Succe&s;&s;or and their King.</P>
<P>But to return to the&s;e blind Princes; There were &s;everal at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> when I was there: and I knew one particularly, who is &s;till alive, and is a per&s;on of ex|cellent natural parts, As blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curio&s;ities, and has built him a Hou&s;e in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which is worthy a mans &s;ight. He is overjoy'd when any per&s;on brings him any rarities out of <HI>Europe,</HI> feeling them in his hands, and cau&s;ing his Eunuchs, which are very apprehen&s;ive, to tell him the meaning of every thing. He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and can tell by his finger when a Watch is right in the Ca&s;e. To know what a Clock it is, he has little points &s;et up in the Dial-plate, and a half hand, to the end he may not be deceiv'd which part of the hand points to the hour. By means of certain figures which he makes of &s;oft wax, and &s;ets in or|der upon a Table, he will ca&s;t up an accompt very exactly. Several other good qualities I admir'd in him; and it griev'd me to &s;ee a man reduc'd to that mi&s;erable Condition, only becau&s;e he was of the blood Royal of <HI>Per|&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Employments of the Kingdom generally fall from Father to Son, yet the King if he plea&s;es may bequeath the Governments of Provinces or any other dignities to any of his <HI>Goulams</HI> which are his Slaves, if he find them ca|pable, and thinks they may be fit for his &s;ervice. The Father to leave the Em|ployment to his Family, labours by degrees to introduce his Son, and to obtain the Survivor&s;hip for him. But if the Father dye, and leaves the Survivor&s;hip to an Infant, there is generally a per&s;on of Age and Experience &s;ent along with him. Some there are al&s;o that obtain employments by pre&s;enting the Favourites at Court.</P>
<P>The State of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;h'd like mo&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> States, into three Bodies. The fir&s;t is that of the Sword, which an&s;wers to the Nobility, and com|prehends the Kings hou&s;hold, the <HI>Kans,</HI> and all the Souldiery. The &s;econd is that of the Quill, comprehending all tho&s;e that belong to the Law and the Courts of Ju&s;tices. The third is compos'd of Merchants, Handicrafts-men and La|bourers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the fir&s;t of the three Orders or States of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which com|prehends the Kings Hou&s;hold, the <HI>Kans</HI> or Governours of Pro|vinces, and the Souldiery.</HEAD>
<P>THE Primier Mini&s;ter of the Kingdom is call'd <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> or the &s;upport of Riches. His office is the &s;ame with the Grand <HI>Vizir's</HI> in <HI>Turkie,</HI> and may be compar'd to the ancient <HI>Mayors</HI> of the <HI>Palace</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> In regard all the af|fairs of the Kingdom pa&s;s through his hands, he ought to be rather a Gownman then a Souldier: and herein he only differs from the Grand <HI>Vizier,</HI> who is always to be at the head of the Army, and for every &s;light fault or di&s;ta&s;te is &s;ubject to be &s;trangl'd by the Grand <HI>Signior.</HI> Whereas in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> where the Government is milder, the Prime Mini&s;ters generally dye in their beds, or if they are Depos'd, they are only exil'd to &s;ome frontier City, where they live as private men.</P>
<P>When the King is young, the Prime Mini&s;ter has a hard game to play, for then the Favourite Eunuchs and the Sultane&s;&s;es di&s;annul and cancel in the night what|ever orders he makes in the day time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nazar</HI> or <HI>Seer</HI> has the charge of all the Kings goods, of his breeds of hor|&s;es, of his moveables, of his Cloaths and Plate: much like the grand Ma&s;ter of the Kings Hou&s;e in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mehter,</HI> who is always a white Eunuch, is the fir&s;t Gentleman of the Kings Chamber, and follows the King with a kind of bag hanging by his &s;ide full of handkerchiefs. And as he is always at the Kings elbow, if he have the Kings ear, it is ea&s;ie for him to befriend or do unkindne&s;&s;es, as his inclination leads him. During the minority of the King, &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Mehters</HI> have been known to go|vern the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mir-Akhor-Ba&s;hi,</HI> or Grand E&s;quire, has the Charge of the Kings Stables, which as well as the Gate of <HI>Ali-Capri,</HI> are a place of Refuge, and whoever &s;aves him&s;elf therein, let it be for Murther or Debt is &s;afe. All the Hor&s;es in the Kings Stable are mark'd with a hot iron upon the left hip, and tho&s;e that belong to pri|vate per&s;ons upon the right. Tho&s;e that the King gives to them that &s;erve in his Armies, have the Kings mark, and are not to be &s;old, but they may be chaffer'd away. If any of tho&s;e Hor&s;es happens to dye in a Hor&s;e-mans hands, he mu&s;t flea off the Kings mark, and carry it to the under Officers of the General of the Cavalry, to have a nother, otherwi&s;e he would be forc'd to buy another at his own expences. Tho&s;e people by laying the skin in the water, know, though by what art I cannot tell, whither the Hor&s;e dy'd of age or &s;ickne&s;s, or whither he were malitiou&s;ly kill'd. For in times of Peace there are &s;om Hor&s;e-men that will kill their Hor&s;es, to &s;ave the Charges of keeping any more than them&s;elves: then at the next Mu&s;ter they bring the skin of their Hor&s;e, with the mark on, to the Of|ficers, and get another, unle&s;s they be found out. Nor are their Hor&s;es only mark'd, but their Scimitars, Mu&s;quets, Bows and Quivers, all which they mu&s;t &s;hew to the Commi&s;&s;ioners every Mu&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> the &s;econd being at <HI>Casbin</HI> in the year 1654, took a general view of his Cavalry, which la&s;ted for ten or twelve days. For the King &s;itting in the Portal of one of his Gardens, with his Officers &s;tanding about him, every day caus'd &s;o many troopers to ride by him: which were all &s;tout active men and well mounted. Every Souldier gallop'd &s;ingly by him; and coming ju&s;t under the King, he &s;hot an Arrow again&s;t a Butt of Turf that was thrown up upon his left hand, and when the Mu&s;ter was over, the King advanc'd the Pay of every Hor&s;e-man, who according to the &s;entence of the Judges had &s;hot neare&s;t the mark.</P>
<P>I was then at <HI>Casbin,</HI> and I remember one Souldier, who quite contrary to what the other Hor&s;e-men did, walk'd his Hor&s;e along by the King, and never-&s;hot, but only lay'd his hand upon his bre&s;t, and then upon his forehead, which is the
<PB N="222" REF="124">
Ceremony of Salutation us'd by the King. He was a very homely fellow, with a flat tawny countenance: &s;o that his behaviour and his pre&s;ence offending the King, in a chafe he commanded that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lack ra&s;cal to be ca&s;hier'd out of his &s;ervice. Immediately they took away his Hor&s;e and his Arms, and were going about to have drubb'd him, but that the General of the Cavalry made them a &s;ign to let him alone. Immediately the General gave the King to under&s;tand that he was one of the be&s;t Souldiers in the Army: as he had &s;ignally made it appear at the Sieges of <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Candahar.</HI> Upon that the King caus'd his Hor&s;e and Arms to be re&s;tor'd him again, and commanded him to ride by him as the re&s;t of the Souldiers had done. When he came again&s;t the Butt, in&s;tead of obeying the Kings command, he turn'd his Hor&s;e to the right and left, without &s;aying a word. The General fearing he would offend the King again, bid him &s;hoot. <HI>What &s;hall I &s;hoot at?</HI> Sir &s;aid he. <HI>Again&s;t the place where all the re&s;t have &s;hot,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Gene|ral. Then the Souldier &s;haking his head and &s;miling, <HI>'Tis not my way,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to &s;pend my Arrows again&s;t a wall; for I know how to make u&s;e of 'em better again&s;t the body or head of the Enemies of my King. I would then &s;hoot thrice before another could &s;hoot once.</HI> At the &s;ame time he draws out two Arrows out of his Quiver, one of which he held in his mouth, and put the other to his bow: and then &s;et|ting &s;purs to his Hor&s;e he out-rid the Butt for the nonce, to &s;hoot backward, which he did, and hit the very middle of the white, then turning his hor&s;es head and pa&s;&s;ing the Butt as before, he &s;hot the &s;econd Arrow into the &s;ame hole, whence they had pull'd the fir&s;t Arrow. Then the General approaching near the King, told him that by what he had heard and &s;een, he might well believe that Hor&s;eman to be as brave a Souldier as any in the Army: which his Maje&s;ty con|fe&s;s'd, and from three Tomans advanc'd his pay to 15 Tomans.</P>

<P>The <HI>Divan-Bequi</HI> is the chief Ju&s;ticiar, as well in Civil as in Criminal cau&s;es, and he keeps his Court either in <HI>Ali Capi,</HI> or in the Kings Hou&s;e, where his Maje&s;ty &s;ometimes pre&s;ides him&s;elf when he plea&s;es. Before him as being and Officer of great Authority, all the Criminals in the Kingdom make their appeal, and he makes out proce&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Kans</HI> and other Grandees of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deroga</HI> is much like the Lieutenant Criminal in <HI>France,</HI> from whom it is lawful to appeal before the <HI>Divan-Bequi.</HI> He has an eye upon Robberies, Batte|ries and Murthers, and he has power to &s;uppre&s;s Hou&s;es of Debauchery. If he catch any debauch'd per&s;ons, he has power to give them the Ba&s;tinado, or to fine them: and mo&s;t commonly he &s;pares corporal cha&s;ti&s;ement to puni&s;h their pur|&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sofragi-Ba&s;hi</HI> is he that &s;preads the <HI>Sofra</HI> before the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chirakgi-Ba&s;hi</HI> is he that has charge of the Wine: chiefly the <HI>Schiras</HI> wine, which is particularly kept for the King, who &s;eldom drinks any other. Nor can
<PB N="223" REF="124">
any particular per&s;on in <HI>Schiras</HI> make Wine till the Court be fir&s;t &s;erv'd, and that with the leave of the <HI>Chirategi-Ba&s;hi;</HI> there being none but the <HI>Franks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> that make it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Me&s;heal-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the chief of the Torch-bearers; who furni&s;hes the Court with Candles, which are all of Wax. To this <HI>Me&s;heal-Ba&s;hi</HI> belong all the fines of tho&s;e that play at Cards or Dice, the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> forbidding all Games of hazard. This Officer has &s;everal inferior Officers under him, who go from place to place to &s;py where they can find any per&s;ons at play: and he has power to break open any hou&s;e, unle&s;s the Ma&s;ter be of great Quality.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kahuergi-Ba&s;hi</HI> is he that has care of the <HI>Kahu&eacute;,</HI> the Ro&s;e-water, and other di&s;tillations which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> drink; as <HI>Bilmi&s;he,</HI> made of the buds of brown Sallows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kara-Seta&s;he</HI> is the King's Chirurgeon, or Barber, who lets him Blood, and &s;haves his Head; and cannot part with his place to another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the great Porter, who has under him &s;everal other Of|ficers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Melikultugagear</HI> is he that has charge of the Stuffs for the King's Hou&s;hold, and puts them out to the Taylors. He takes an account of the &s;hreds and old ha|bits, which &s;erve to make Cloathes for the Souldiers, deducting for them out of their pay.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gelander-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the chief of the Foot-men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mir-ahe,</HI> or the Prince of the Seals, is the Superintendent of the Seals&punc; and for profit, is one of the be&s;t employments in the Kingdom. He has the &s;ale of the Canal-water to the Country-men; for which he makes the Farmers pay a &s;evere rate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Karkrone</HI> is the Hou&s;e for the Royal Manufactures, where the Gold and Silver-Carpets are made, as al&s;o tho&s;e of Silks and Wor&s;ted, together with Ti&s;|&s;ues, Velvet, and Taffeta's. There are other Workmen that make Coats of Mail, Bows, Arrows, Scimitars, and other Arms. In other Apartments are Limners that paint in Water-colours; Lapidaries, and Gold&s;miths, that only make Silver-Rings. For in regard the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> cannot &s;ay their Prayers when they have any Gold about 'em, they never wear Jewel or Ring of Gold, becau&s;e it would be trouble&s;ome to pull 'em off, and lay 'em up &s;o many times a-day. And therefore the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> cau&s;es all his Jewels to be &s;et in Silver, as we &s;et all our Stones in Gold. As for working Gold&s;miths, they have none in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> all their Gold and Silver-Plate being wrought by the Copper-&s;miths in round figure, for they have not the art to frame an Oval.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nakka&s;he-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the Serjeant-Painter, who only works in miniature; they cover their Pictures with a Varni&s;h made of Ma&s;tich &s;teep'd in a certain Oil that di&s;tils from a Rock that points upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI>-Sea not far from <HI>Shamatri.</HI> It di&s;tils out of the Rock at fir&s;t like water; but afterwards it thickens till it be|come as thick as Sallet-Oil, pre&s;erving &s;till its whitene&s;s. There are al&s;o three other Rocks not far from the former, from whence this Oyl di&s;tils; but it is thicker, and of darker colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negeach-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the chief of the Joyners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Embardar-Ba&s;hi</HI> has the charge of the King's Granaries, and other Provi|&s;ions, having &s;everal Officers under him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Odondar-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the Ma&s;ter of the Wood-yard.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of the&s;e Officers have their diet in the King's Hou&s;e, or el&s;e an allowance of Diet from thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tu&s;hemal-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the Clerk of the Kitchen. He orders what &s;hall be &s;erv'd up to the King, and when the Table is clear'd, he &s;ticks his Knife in the be&s;t di&s;h, and orders it to be carri'd home to his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now for the Officers of War, the principal are; Fir&s;t, the <HI>Sepeh-Salar, Gene|rali&s;&s;imo</HI> of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Armies, who is never con&s;tituted but in time of War; which being ended, his employment cea&s;es. His place in Council is im|mediately next to the <HI>Athemadoulet.</HI></P>
<P>Now in regard the Militia is divided into three &s;orts, there are al&s;o three Ge|nerals. The three Bodies of the Militia are the <HI>Cor&s;chis,</HI> the <HI>Goulams,</HI> and the <HI>Tufenlegis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="125">
The <HI>Cor&s;chis</HI> are de&s;cended from a forreign race, which have &s;till a great repute for their Valour. The&s;e people live in Tents, like the <HI>Turcomans;</HI> and they &s;end their Youth betimes to the King. They furni&s;h their Youth al&s;o with all nece&s;|&s;aries, and maintain them till they come to be taken notice of by the King. They are all Hor&s;e-men, well paid, and well look'd to, and are many times advanc'd to the Supreme Dignities of the Kingdom. They are generally call'd <HI>Ke&s;el-Ba&s;hi,</HI> or <HI>Red-heads,</HI> becau&s;e that formerly they wore red Bonnets. It is &s;aid that the King has about 22000 of the&s;e <HI>Corchis</HI> in pay, all good Souldiers, that do won|ders in Battel. <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the fir&s;t did what he could to aboli&s;h this Militia, and to &s;et up the <HI>Goulams</HI> in their &s;tead. His hatred again&s;t them was only becau&s;e he thought them too powerful; for he was wont to &s;ay to his Favourites, that nothing but the Pui&s;&s;ance of the <HI>Corchis,</HI> could oppo&s;e the Royal Power, There|upon he took away &s;ome of their Priviledges, and gave them to the <HI>Doulams;</HI> but he could not bring about his de&s;ign any farther.</P>
<P>The General of the <HI>Corchis</HI> is call'd <HI>Cor&s;chi-Ba&s;hi,</HI> and ought to be one of their Body; nor can the King impo&s;e another upon them. The <HI>Mim-Ba&s;hi</HI> commands a thou&s;and Men, the <HI>Yux-Ba&s;hi</HI> commands a hundred, and the <HI>Om-Ba&s;hi</HI> com|mands ten. The <HI>Cor&s;chi-Ba&s;hi</HI> has 150 <HI>Tomans</HI> a year; the <HI>Mim-Ba&s;hi</HI> &s;ixty-two; the <HI>Yuz-Ba&s;hi</HI> thirty, and the <HI>Om-Ba&s;hi</HI> fifteen. The pay of every Hor&s;e man is from nine to fifteen <HI>Tomans</HI> a year. Be&s;ides, every year the King makes a gene|ral Mu&s;ter, and then he gives to the <HI>Cor&s;chis</HI> a third part more than their u&s;ual pay; however, to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, either according to favour or merit. When the King has re&s;olv'd to put a great Man to death, he commits the execu|tion of his command to a <HI>Cor&s;chi.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gouler-Aga&s;i</HI> is General of the <HI>Goulams,</HI> or Slaves. For indeed they are either Slaves, or the Sons of Slaves of all &s;orts of Nations, who do the King ve|ry good Service. They are for the mo&s;t part runnegade <HI>Georgians;</HI> and there are about 18000 of the&s;e <HI>Goulams,</HI> being all Hor&s;e-men who&s;e pay is from five to eight <HI>Tomans</HI> a year. The <HI>Cor&s;chis</HI> are very good Husbands; but the <HI>Goulams,</HI> as &s;oon as they have receiv'd their pay, fall a drinking and &s;waggering; whereas the other, if he has a <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> to &s;pare, will buy a Sheep with it: For in regard they live in Tents, their Riches con&s;i&s;ts in Flocks. The greate&s;t part of the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is made up of the&s;e two Bodies. The <HI>Goulams</HI> have this peculiar to them|&s;elves, that they are very rarely known to revolt. For being all Slaves, and of different Nations, there are no ties of Affection or Kindred between them: And if the King has an occa&s;ion to puni&s;h any of them, the chief of their Body is to execute his orders. The <HI>Goulams</HI> carry no other Arms be&s;ides a Bow and Ar|rows, with a Skain. Though &s;ome wear Coats of Mail, and Head-pieces: others Vambraces and Battel-Axes. The&s;e Hor&s;e-men never entrench in the Field like ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor have they any Field-Mar&s;hals to a&s;&s;ign them quarters. For after the chief have taken up the be&s;t places, the re&s;t &s;et up their Tents as neer as they can to the Pavillion of the General.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tufenkgiler-Aga&s;i</HI> is the General of the <HI>Tufenkgis,</HI> who compo&s;e the third Body of the Militia. This part of the Souldiery was but lately in&s;tituted, being compos'd of men taken from the Plough, as being mo&s;t fit for labour. They are Foot-men with only a Scimiter and a Musket. But when they march, they have a Hor&s;e or a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">le between three or four, to carry their Baggage and Provi&s;ions. Their pay is not above four or five <HI>Tomans</HI> a year. And for their Officers, their pay is more or le&s;s according to their Quality and Command. They are in no, great reputation, being laugh'd at by the old Souldiers, as being a company of poor Countrey-men, that dare not look an enemy in the face. Not but that the Infantry of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is able to do good &s;ervice; though, as numerous as they are, the King never makes u&s;e of them, but in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. When he marches in per&s;on, he &s;ends for eight or ten thou&s;and, which he &s;ends for out of what Province be&s;t plea&s;es him, and they prove very u&s;eful to the Army, as Sutlers. This Infan|try is compos'd of the Countrey-men that live in Tents, abiding in the Mountains all the hot Summer, and betaking them&s;elves in the Winter to the hot Countreys. Every Tribe or Family knows how many men it ought to &s;et out. And there is not a Foot-man that has not his new-Suit in his Che&s;t, and his Musket and Scimi|ter in very good order. They are well train'd, and well di&s;ciplin'd; for every
<PB N="225" REF="125">
three months the Governor of the Province takes a view of all the Souldiers in his Province, and cau&s;es them to be exercis'd in his own pre&s;ence. They are order'd to &s;hoot at a mark, and they that hit it, are &s;ure to have &s;ome reward from the Governor. When the King &s;ends for any part of his Infantry, they pre|&s;ently know who is to lead 'em; and they are lu&s;ty, and well cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, never put|ting on their be&s;t Cloathes but when they mu&s;ter, or march into the Field. They pay to the King little or nothing: for of all their Cattel great and &s;mall, they pay but one in the hundred to him, and one <HI>Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> or 18 <HI>Sous</HI> of our Money.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;hek-Aga&s;i,</HI> or chief of the <HI>Ke&s;hek&s;hi's,</HI> who are the King's Guards, and carry a Musket with a very wide bore. They were but lately in&s;tituted by the <HI>Athemat-doulet,</HI> when he intended to de&s;troy the <HI>Divan-begui.</HI> This Officer has about 2000 men under him, of which he di&s;po&s;es every night a certain number, round about the Palace. When the King &s;its in Council, he &s;tands there with a Battoon in his hand, and throws him&s;elf to the ground when the King beckons to him to come and receive any command from his mouth. The <HI>Topigi-Ba&s;hi</HI> is the Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, and chief of the Sea-affairs, but he has little to do in either employment. For, as for the Cannon, there are only &s;ome two or three pittiful Guns in &s;ome of the Frontier-towns: And for Ships, there are none in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> but what come from <HI>Europe</HI> or the <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Ormus</HI> or <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI> The <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves have no other Ships than &s;ome few large Barks in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>-Gulph, and in &s;ome parts of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI>-Sea, where they keep a Fleet again&s;t the <HI>&V;sbeck Tartars,</HI> the <HI>Kalmoukes,</HI> and other people.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Kans</HI> or Governors of Provinces, they are generally cho&s;en out of the body of <HI>Cor&s;chi's</HI> and <HI>Goulams;</HI> who are hand&s;om per&s;ons, and generally much more Valiant than the natural <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> For the natural complexion of the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> is not good, as may be &s;een by the <HI>Gaures,</HI> the original, Inhabitants of the Countrey, who are for the mo&s;t part tann'd, and ill-&s;hap'd. So that there is hardly a <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> from the King to the meane&s;t of his Subjects, who is not a <HI>Georgian,</HI> or &s;prung from the loins of <HI>Georgians,</HI> For they fetch a great number of Slaves out of <HI>Georgia;</HI> by the frequent Marriages of which women, the <HI>Georgian</HI> Valour and Beauty are become Natives of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kans</HI> or Governors of Provinces are as &s;o many petty Kings, fear'd and re|&s;pected by all the people. And when they are &s;ettl'd, they are never depos'd, but upon repeated complaints of their exce&s;&s;ive Tyranny. There are &s;ome of the&s;e Governments that yield the <HI>Kan</HI> &s;even or eight thou&s;and <HI>Tomans.</HI> But they are bound to pre&s;ent the King every year at <HI>Nourons,</HI> or New-year-tide.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Kans</HI> there are al&s;o Governors of le&s;&s;er quality, who are al&s;o im|mediately preferr'd by the King, and cannot be depos'd by any per&s;on but him|&s;elf. If they abu&s;e their Authority, the complaints brought again&s;t him are fir&s;t carri'd to the <HI>Kan,</HI> which, if they concern the Government of the Kingdom, the <HI>Kan</HI> is bound to inform the King thereof. But if the complaints are not con&s;iderable, then the <HI>Kan</HI> may do Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, and make the <HI>Sultans</HI> know their duty.</P>
<P>There is yet a third &s;ort of Governors, call'd <HI>A&s;ephs,</HI> who are the King's Lieu|tenants in places where he had <HI>Kans</HI> in former times; or where he ought to have them &s;till, but only to &s;ave charges. For in the Provinces where <HI>Kans</HI> Govern, they and their Officers, almo&s;t equalling in name and number the Officers of the King's Hou&s;hold, devour all the profits of the Province, but what the <HI>Kan</HI> is ob|lig'd annually to pay.</P>
<P>By what I have wrote as well concerning the King's Hou&s;hold, the Governors of his Provinces, and the Officers of his Army, it may be ea&s;ily concluded that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Court is the mo&s;t magnificent and glorious of all the Courts of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and be&s;ides, that it is the mo&s;t Polite and Civil of all the <HI>Orient.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the &s;econd Order, containing all tho&s;e that belong to the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Law, and their Courts of Ju&s;tice; and, in general, of all the Gown-men; &s;uch as are chiefly the Officers of the Chamber of Accounts.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd of the three E&s;tates of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> comprehends the Gown-men, &s;uch as are the Doctors of the Law, the Officers of Ju&s;tice, and tho&s;e of the Chamber of Accounts.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Athemat-doulet</HI> is the Prime Mini&s;ter in Temporals, the <HI>Sedre</HI> is the Prime Mini&s;ter in Spirituals, and the High-Prie&s;t of the Law. However, he does not pretend to take place before the <HI>Athemat-doulet</HI> either in Council, or in the publick Ceremonies. There is this difference between the <HI>Sedre</HI> and the <HI>Mufti</HI> in <HI>Turkey,</HI> that in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignities are no bar from Civil Employments; &s;o that the <HI>Sedre</HI> is many times made <HI>Athemat-doulet.</HI></P>
<P>The Dignity of <HI>Sedre</HI> is not limited to one &s;ingle per&s;on, but may be divided between two, in regard there are two &s;orts of Legacies, the one from the King's of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the other from particular per&s;ons. Therefore for the more careful Superintendency over the&s;e two &s;orts of Legacies, there are &s;ometimes two <HI>Se|dres</HI> appointed. The one is call'd <HI>Sedre-Kras,</HI> particular or peculiar <HI>Sedre</HI> who manages all the Revenues of the Royal Foundations, and di&s;tributes them to the <HI>Mullaks</HI> and Students according to their merit. The other is call'd <HI>Sedre-el-man|koufat,</HI> who has the management of private Foundations. In the year 1667 the King created two <HI>Sedres,</HI> and marri'd them to two of his Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sedre</HI> has two men under him, who&s;e Authority is almo&s;t equal to theirs. The one is call'd <HI>Sheik-el-&s;elom,</HI> and the other <HI>Cadi:</HI> and the&s;e are they that decide all controver&s;ies in Religion, judge of Divorces, make Contracts and publick Acts. The&s;e two Dignities are in the King's nomination: and in all the principal Cities of the Kingdom there are two of the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Judges for all matters that concern the Law.</P>
<P>To every <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> there belongs a <HI>Pichnamaz,</HI> who is always fir&s;t there before Prayers begin; and he teaches the people to Pray by learning of him, having their eyes always fix'd upon him to that end. This <HI>Pickanmaz</HI> is the &s;ame with him whom the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Iman.</HI> The <HI>Moullah's</HI> are the Doctors of the Law, as are the <HI>Hodgia's</HI> in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and they are well paid out of the Legacies giv'n to the <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> for reading every Friday, and interpreting the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to the people. He that reads, &s;its in one Chair; and he that interprets, in another, &s;omewhat lower upon the left-hand of the Reader. They are al&s;o bound to teach the Sci|ences to all tho&s;e that require it: And as a mark of Sanctity, they wear a great white Turbant, with a &s;ingle Chamlet-habit of the &s;ame colour. Their gate is grave, and their di&s;cour&s;e very &s;erious; yet all this is but pure hypocri&s;y. When they light into any con&s;iderable company of people, they pre&s;ently ri&s;e, and ex|hort 'em to go to Prayers. At the &s;ame time they wa&s;h their heads, their hands, and their feet, and &s;pread a felt upon the ground, or if they are poor, a &s;ingle mat. Upon this, at one end, the <HI>Maulla</HI> kneels, at the other lies a flat Stone about the bigne&s;s of the palm of a man's hand, which was brought from <HI>Mecca.</HI> Which Stones the <HI>Moullah's</HI> always carry about 'em; for being commanded while they are at their devotions often to ki&s;s the ground, they rather choo&s;e to ki&s;s a Stone brought from &s;o holy a place, than the prophane Earth. They have a kind of a Mariners compa&s;s, which directs them punctually where <HI>Mecca</HI> &s;tands, to the end they may know which way to turn when they &s;ay their Prayers. The Prayer which the <HI>Moulla</HI>'s make, &s;eems to be accompani'd with a great deal of zeal, and they take great notice all the while whether the company be atten|tive or no. Some <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that a <HI>Vizir</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> &s;uffer'd his leg to rot off, becau&s;e he would not let a Chri&s;tian Chirurgeon touch him, for fear of being defil'd.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="126">
There belongs al&s;o to every <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> a <HI>Monteveli,</HI> who looks after the repairs of the Building, and the Provi&s;ion of what belongs to the <HI>Mo&s;quee;</HI> together with a <HI>Mouazen,</HI> who cries morning and evening from the top of a Tower, <HI>That there is but one God, and that</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI></P>
<P>Colledges, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Medre&s;e;</HI> where there are a great number of Scholars bred up at little charge, out of the Legacies left to the Foundations. They al|low them a Chamber without any Furniture, they being to provide a Coverlet and a <HI>Mattre&s;s</HI> for them&s;elves, They have no certain Ma&s;ters, but &s;ometimes they go for their in&s;tructions to one, &s;ometimes to another, &s;eldom to the Princi|pal of the Colledg, who is call'd <HI>Monderes,</HI> and is generally the greate&s;t Block|head of them all. But there are &s;everal other per&s;ons in every good City that are forward to teach the Sciences to purcha&s;e honour to them&s;elves. For which rea&s;on they are very liberal, to get a great company of Fol|lowers together, who are as &s;o many Trumpets to publi&s;h the wi&s;dom of their <HI>Akroom</HI> or Doctor. But when their Liberality cea&s;es, the Trumpets want breath at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Now as to their manner of &s;tudying, the Student fir&s;t reads two or three lines, and then the Doctor Expounds. Then another reads two or three lines more, and &s;o one after another; every one ri&s;ing up out of re&s;pect after he has done reading, and &s;tanding upright till the Doctor bids him &s;it down again. One of the&s;e Doctors &s;hall teach all manner of Sciences in one day; for he is not learned that cannot talk of all. And certainly had the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> tho&s;e advantages of Books, and that method of &s;tudy which we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> they would prove to be men of great under&s;tanding: for with tho&s;e little helps they have, they will give a good account of their own Theology, of Logick, Phy&s;ick, and the Mathematicks, wherein they &s;trive to reach the bottom of things as deep as they can. Their Books are for the mo&s;t part the works of an ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Author, who&s;e name was <HI>Kodgia Ne&s;ir</HI> in the City of <HI>Thou&s;s,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kora&s;&s;an.</HI> 'Tis very probable he was well skill'd in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Arabick,</HI> having tran&s;lated into <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> &s;everal Books out of tho&s;e two Languages. They have &s;ome pieces of <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> which are accounted the be&s;t in the We&s;t: The <HI>Almage&s;tes</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> which they call <HI>Mage&s;ti,</HI> &s;ome tractates of <HI>Euclide,</HI> &s;ome fragments of <HI>Archimedes:</HI> the <HI>Opticks</HI> of <HI>Ehne, Hei&s;ter,</HI> and other excellent Books. Some have affirm'd that they have been skill'd in the doctrin of <HI>Sines</HI> and <HI>Tangents</HI> for above this 800 years: and indeed they are very curious at this day in Mathematical In&s;truments. They have al&s;o a great inclination to Poetry, the chief grace whereof they be|lieve to con&s;i&s;t in de&s;ign of accidents, and high compari&s;ons ob&s;erving thime as we do. As for Phy&s;ick, they have <HI>Galen,</HI> whom they call <HI>Galenous; Averroes,</HI> whom they call <HI>Aboualt,</HI> or <HI>great Father;</HI> and <HI>Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus,</HI> whom they call <HI>Or|mous.</HI> The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their Hi&s;torians is <HI>Ronze el Sapha,</HI> who wrot a Chronology from the Creation of the World to his time; wherein there are abundance of fables, but little truth. He &s;ays that the World was inhabited by Devis for an infinite number of years before the Creation of <HI>Adam,</HI> and that God for their enormities depriv'd them of their power upon earth, and gave it to man to manage. Their Books, though deer, are very common, and every Trades-man buys 'em, being very ambitious to learn the Sciences them&s;elves, and to encou|rage their children to do &s;o too. They &s;end them betimes to the School, which they call <HI>Meklebe,</HI> of which there are &s;everal in every Quarter. They make a hideous noi&s;e in their Schools, repeating their Le&s;&s;ons alltogether aloud, while the Ma&s;ter corrects every Boy that does not keep along with the Cry. As for the children of per&s;ons of Quality, they have Tutors at home, never &s;tirring out of doors till they are 18 years of age, unle&s;s it be to go a hunting or a &s;hoot|ing now and then. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the Children are di&s;creet, civil and mode&s;t; &s;o that you &s;hall never hear an ill word come out of their mouths.</P>
<P>In the Chamber of Accounts are many Officers, whom I look upon as Gown|men. All the Books and Regi&s;ters pa&s;s through their hands, particularly &s;uch Pa|pers as concern'd the King's Revenue. All which are regi&s;ter'd in the Chamber of Accounts at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Defter Krone.</HI> As to the Fee-Lands call'd <HI>Moulkerbar,</HI> which belong to particular per&s;ons, they owe to the King a certain
<PB N="228" REF="127">
annual Rent, which the Governors of Provinces exact with a &s;evere extorti|on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Me&s;tempti</HI> and the <HI>Memaleck</HI> are they that value the Rent of all Lands in Deme&s;h, which is one of the principal charges of the <HI>Defter Kroon.</HI> They al&s;o take cogni&s;ance of all the King's Farns, Quit-Rents, Provi&s;ions and Ex|pences of Receivers and Collectors. There is al&s;o a <HI>Me&s;tempti</HI> to value Lega|cies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nazar</HI> controuls the <HI>Me&s;tempti</HI> and the <HI>Memalek,</HI> and his hand is requir'd to all Papers of di&s;patch.</P>
<P>The <HI>Deroga</HI> or Provo&s;t of the <HI>Defter-Kroon</HI> is to pro&s;ecute and puni&s;h all that are guilty of fal&s;e Receipts, or of Exaction.</P>
<P>Into this Office are deliver'd all the Grants and A&s;&s;ignations of the wages of the King's Officers. Every man comes and receives his own, or &s;ends for it to tho&s;e places upon which this Money is a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>In every Village or Borough there is a <HI>Reis,</HI> or chief of the place, to whom the Officers apply them&s;elves for their Money: For &s;hould they terrify the Countrey-man, he would run quit&egrave; away, and pay nothing. The greate&s;t cheat in this Chamber of Accounts, is, that in regard the Officers keep the Roll of the Officers wages, they will give them divers Bills to receive little parcels at &s;everal places di&s;tant from one another, till the Sum be made up; to which trouble rather than the Kings &s;ervant will be put, he will give a good gratuity to the Officer to pay him all together. But becau&s;e the Officers are not able to &s;atisfy all that come, there are certain <HI>Thah&s;ilders</HI> or hoarders up of Rent, who buy for ready Money as cheap as they can, &s;uch Bills as private men come to receive at the Chamber; and when they have got a good number together, they go and receive them altogether at the Chamber, and make great advantage. By this mi&s;government of the <HI>Defter-Kroon,</HI> &s;everal per&s;ons are very much oppre&s;t. For he that has but 30 <HI>Tomans</HI> a year, &s;hall be forc'd to give a good &s;hare out of it to have the re&s;t in ready Mo|ney; which has been often the ruine of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army, through the abu&s;es and defalcations put upon the poor Souldiers. During the Reign of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the 1; and toward the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> his Son, the Exche|quer was better regulated; but when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> come to be at Peace with their Neighbours, the King and his Lords have minded nothing le&s;s then the payment of the Souldiery.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Lands in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> belong to the King, and are only farm'd by private per&s;ons. The re&s;t of the Lands are mea&s;ur'd, and every Land pays &s;o much a mea&s;ure. The King al&s;o has a va&s;t income by the Merchandizes that pay Cu&s;tom and Toll. The Port of <HI>Bander Aba&s;&s;i</HI> alone brings him one year with another, when lea&s;t, be&s;ides accidents, neer upon 20000 <HI>Tomans.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the third E&s;tate of the Kingdom, comprehending the Trade&s;|men and Merchants: as al&s;o of the Trades, Manufactures, and Commodities of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Commerce of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as in all other Kingdoms, con&s;i&s;ts in the Trade of the Country and Forraign Traffick. Only with difference, that the Country Trade is in the hands of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> the forraign Traffic in the hands of the <HI>Armenians</HI> only, who are as it were the Kings and the Noble mens Fa|ctors to &s;ell their &s;ilk.</P>
<P>As for the Handicraft trades, there are &s;ome Corporations that pay a certain yearly duty to the King, as Shoemakers, Cutlers, Smiths, and others. Some are free, as the Joyners and Ma&s;ons; though he get by their labour as much as others pay him in money. For when the King requires twenty Ma&s;ons for a work which is in ha&s;t, the <HI>Marmar Ba&s;hi</HI> who is their Chief, &s;ummons them together, and they that gave mo&s;t are excus'd. For when the King requires twenty, he &s;ummons forty: and thus every man lives by his calling. The practice is the &s;ame with the Chief of the Joyners, and all other Trades, who are Officers pay'd by the King, and never work unle&s;s they plea&s;e them&s;elves, commanding all that are under their Juri&s;diction. As for Carpenters and Joyners work, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> know little what belongs to it, which proceeds from the &s;carcity of Wood, that does not allow them materials to work upon. So that for Chains, Tables and Bed&s;teads, there are no &s;uch things to be &s;een in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> the Joyners bu&s;ine&s;s being only to make Doors and Frames for Windows, which they make very neatly of &s;everal pieces of wood joyn'd together, &s;o that a man can hardly put a Tennis Ball through the holes where they put the gla&s;s. Nor can it be expected that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;hould work like other <HI>Europeans,</HI> having no other Tools then a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Chizzel, and one &s;ort of Plainer, which a <HI>French-man</HI> brought among them.</P>
<P>Their nobler Arts are Writing, for Printers they know none. All their Books are writt'n, which is the rea&s;on they &s;o much e&s;teem that Art. There was an <HI>Armenian</HI> who had &s;et up a Printing-Pre&s;s at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and had Printed the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the &s;even Penitential P&s;alms, and was going about to Print the whole Bible, but not having the way of making good Ink, and to avoid the ill con&s;equen|ces of the Invention, he was forc'd to break his Pre&s;s. For on the one &s;ide the Children refus'd to learn to write, pretending they wrote the Bible them&s;elves, on|ly to get it the &s;ooner by heart: on the other &s;ide many per&s;ons were undone by it, that got their living by writing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e three &s;orts of hands, the fir&s;t is call'd <HI>Ne&s;talick,</HI> or the Set hand; the &s;econd <HI>Shake&s;te</HI> or <HI>Divanni,</HI> which is their Court-hand: the third <HI>Neskre,</HI> or the Running-hand, very like the <HI>Arabic.</HI> They write with &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Reeds; and &s;ay, that to write well a man ought to lean &s;o &s;lightly upon his Pen, that &s;hould a fly &s;tand upon the other end it would fall out of his hand. When they write they hold their Paper in one hand to turn it according to the motion of the Pen, other|wi&s;e they could not make their da&s;hes large and free, as the Character requires. They make their Paper of Cotton Fu&s;tian, very cour&s;e, brown, and of no &s;trength, for the lea&s;t folding tears it. They &s;leek it with a &s;leek &s;tone, and then rub it over to make it more &s;leek. Their Ink is made of Galls and Charcoal pounded together with Soot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> reck'n four Languages among 'em. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> call'd <HI>Belick,</HI> that is, &s;weet and plea&s;ing. The <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> call'd <HI>Scia&s;cet,</HI> or the Rodomontado Language. The <HI>Arabian,</HI> to which they give the Epithite of <HI>Fe&s;chi&s;h</HI> or Eloquent: and the fourth, call'd <HI>Coba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et,</HI> or the Speech of the Country people. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> in u&s;e among the Gentry is compos'd almo&s;t of all <HI>Arabie</HI> words: by rea&s;on that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> is very barren. But the Gibbri&s;h of the Country people is &s;o corrupt that they in the City can hardly under&s;tand 'em. The <HI>Arabian</HI> is the Language of the Learned, in which tongue their Books are written. The Language of the Court
<PB N="230" REF="128">
is <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> but much more &s;oft and elegant then at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> As for the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language, it is &s;poken in the Courts of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> in all which Courts a Noble man would take it for an af|front to be &s;pok'n to in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language.</P>
<P>As for their Painters they only paint in miniature, and for Birds and Flowers they will draw them indifferently: But for figures and &s;tories they know not what belongs to any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are mo&s;t excellent Arti&s;ts for manufactures of Gold, Silk and Silver, of which their rich Carpets and Ti&s;&s;ues are made: nor do their Gold and Silver Manufactures ever grow black or lo&s;e their lu&s;ter by long wearing or lying by. There are abundance that work in Silk &s;tuffs of all &s;orts, and others that make Bonnets and Girdles of Gold and Silk. Others there are who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to fa&s;t'n flowers of Gold and Silver to their Taffata's, with gum water, of which the women make Shifts and Drawers. And now they begin to make &s;uch large quantities of Taffata's, that they care not for the &s;tuffs which are brought out of <HI>India,</HI> though they be much finer.</P>
<P>They al&s;o make great quantities of Linnen Cloth of all &s;orts of colours, upon which they fa&s;t'n &s;everal flowers with gum water, and &s;ome figures, though the Law forbid it. Which they learnt to do upon the <HI>Armenians</HI> carrying out of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> &s;ome ill-favour'd cuts and pieces in di&s;temper which they bought here without judgment: the&s;e pieces they hang before their doors, and tho&s;e hollow places in the walls where they put their Quilts and Carpets when they ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are excellent Arti&s;ts at Dama&s;quing with Vitriol, or engraving Da|mask-wi&s;e upon Swords, Knives, and the like. But the nature of the Steel which they make u&s;e of, very much contributes to their Art, in regard they cannot perform the &s;ame work neither upon their own nor ours. This &s;teel is brought from <HI>Golconda,</HI> and is the only &s;ort of &s;teel which can be dama&s;qu'd. For when the workman puts it in the fire, he needs no more then to give it the redne&s;s of a Cherry, and in&s;tead of quenching it in the water as we do, to wrap it in a moi&s;t Linnen cloath: for &s;hould he give it the &s;ame heat as to ours, it would grow &s;o hard that when it came to be wrought it would break like gla&s;s. I &s;peak this to undeceive tho&s;e people who think our Scimitars and Cut-la&s;&s;es are made of &s;teel of <HI>Dama&s;eus,</HI> which is a vulgar error; there being no &s;teel but that of <HI>Golconda</HI> that can be Damask'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are al&s;o excellent Arti&s;ts at making Bows and Arrows, and &s;uch other weapons as are us'd in that Country. As for Bridles and Sadles their Ar|ti&s;ts far exceed ours, e&s;pecially in their &s;owing, which they do &s;o neatly and with &s;o much art with a kind of back-&s;titch, that it looks almo&s;t like an embroidery. There are an infinite number that live by dre&s;&s;ing Seal-skins and Goat-skins, the fir&s;t to make boots for the Gentry and better &s;ort of Merchants, the latter for the poor people.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a &s;ort of earthen ware made at <HI>Kerman</HI> which is very fine, and be|ing brok'n looks as white within as without. It does not endure heat &s;o well as <HI>Porcellane,</HI> which has this quality, that if you powre never &s;o hot liquor into a <HI>Porcellane</HI> cup, neither the foot nor the brims a-top will be any thing the warmer.</P>
<P>There are abundance of poor people that get their living by mending gla&s;s To|bacco-pipes, for when they are brok'n they join them together again with a cer|tain ma&s;tic made of lime, and the white of an egg, then with a Diamond-pointed piercer they make holes in the gla&s;s, and bind the pieces together with a thin Latten-wire.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable commodities of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are the Silks which come out of the Province of <HI>Guilan.</HI> But there is not &s;o much tran&s;ported out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as men imagin. For formerly great quantities of Velvets, Ti&s;&s;ues and Taffata's were tran&s;ported out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into the&s;e parts, but now we make them better and cheap|er in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o a va&s;t quantity of flat &s;ilk tran&s;ported out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Turkie, Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> which the women u&s;e in embroidery: for the Colours being lively, they embroider their &s;hifts, handkerchers, vails, and other linnen with it.</P>
<P>The Seal-skins and Goat-skins which are dre&s;s't in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are tran&s;ported by the
<PB N="231" REF="128">
<HI>Hollander</HI> into <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> Great quantities al&s;o of both are tran&s;ported into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ronas,</HI> that famous Root, of which I have already &s;poken, is tran&s;ported over all <HI>India,</HI> where there is al&s;o a great vent of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> fruits pickl'd in Vinegar, as al&s;o of their &s;weet waters.</P>
<P>Their Pi&s;taches grow in great abundance about <HI>Casbin;</HI> Almonds from the Terri|tories of <HI>Ye&s;d</HI> and <HI>Kerman,</HI> Rai&s;ins from &s;everal parts of the Kingdom, e&s;pecially from <HI>Schirus:</HI> And their purgative Prunes, which they call <HI>Alonbacdra,</HI> from the Frontiers that border upon <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>Great &s;tore of Quinces can died, and boxes of Marmaled made at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> are thence tran&s;ported into <HI>India,</HI> where they are bought up by the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> For the <HI>Banians</HI> will eat none, for fear they &s;hould by accident bury a fly in their &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>Great &s;tore of dry'd Fruits are brought out of the Country of the <HI>Medes,</HI> and tran&s;ported to <HI>Tooat,</HI> to <HI>Diarbequir, Nineveh</HI> and <HI>Dagdat.</HI> Among the re&s;t a &s;ort of &s;mall Apricots, very plea&s;ing to the ta&s;te, which being boyl'd in water make a plea&s;ant &s;yrrup, and are the only diet for the &s;ick in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o great &s;tore of painted Calicuts made in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which being cour&s;e, are only worn and made u&s;e of by the poor, &s;o that there is very little tran&s;ported out of the Country, but what is carried into <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o make a great deal of money of their Cattel; and to begin with their <HI>Camels,</HI> they &s;ell va&s;t numbers of them into <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Natolia.</HI> But the Governours of the Provinces are very unwilling to part with them; which very much abates the trade. For the <HI>Turks</HI> very highly e&s;teem the <HI>Per&s;ian Camels,</HI> as being &s;tronger than their own. They al&s;o &s;ell great &s;tore of Hor&s;es and Mules; but that trade is not &s;o con&s;iderable, the chiefe&s;t part being only &s;ent into <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Sheep, 'tis a wonderful thing to &s;ee what prodigious numbers come out of the Province of the <HI>Medes</HI> and the Higher <HI>Armenia,</HI> and the Forraign Mer|chants come as far as <HI>Tauris</HI> and <HI>Hamadan</HI> to fetch thew away. They drive them as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of the Mutton which is &s;pent in <HI>Natolia</HI> and <HI>Romania</HI> comes out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which very much enriches <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with ready mony. But when Lamb is in &s;ea&s;on, as we travel with the Ca|ravans, we meet at every turn with flocks after flocks, the lea&s;t of which con&s;i&s;ts of a thou&s;and Lambs: and in regard there are &s;ome of tho&s;e Lambs that are weary, and lag behind, we buy them at a cheap rate, the Shepherds that are not able to carry them, being glad to be rid of 'em.</P>
<P>Formerly the Merchant Fewellers brought &s;ome Turquoi&s;es of the old rock out of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but for the&s;e 15 years la&s;t pa&s;t there have bin none found. The la&s;t time I was there I could only meet with three, which were but rea&s;onable. As for tho&s;e of the new rock, they are of no value, becau&s;e they do not keep their colour, but turn green in a little time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ju&s;tice and Policy of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is very exact and very &s;peedy. Suits are determin'd upon the place without any need of Advocates or Proctors. Not but that the Officers of Ju&s;tice are ea&s;ie to be corrupted, but in their unju&s;t exactions, which they carry as &s;ecretly as po&s;&s;ibly they can, they are &s;ooner &s;atisfi'd then the <HI>Turks:</HI> and if their inju&s;tice be di&s;cover'd, upon complaint to the King they are puni&s;ht without mercy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kans</HI> do Ju&s;tice in their Provinces, as repre&s;enting the Kings per&s;on. Be|&s;ides that, the King has a <HI>Divan Begui</HI> in every City, and the <HI>Kan</HI> places under him a <HI>Deroga,</HI> who is like the Lieutenant Criminal in <HI>France.</HI> He has under him an <HI>Aatas,</HI> who is a kind of Captain of the watch; who goes about the &s;treets in the night to hinder di&s;orders, and carries all people to Pri&s;on that he finds abroad at un&s;ea&s;onable hours, if they cannot give a good accompt of them&s;elves. There is al&s;o a <HI>Kelonter,</HI> that is, the chiefe&s;t or greate&s;t, who &s;eems to re&s;emble the Tri|bune of the People among the <HI>Romans,</HI> or the Provo&s;t of Merchants in <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>Kelonter</HI> is only re&s;pon&s;ible to the King, who places one in every City, and it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to defend the People from the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ions of the Go|vernours.</P>
<P>Murther is &s;everely puni&s;h'd, nor will money &s;ave the Criminal. When the Murtherer is tak'n, they carry him before the <HI>Divan Begui,</HI> who makes quick work. For he delivers him to the Parents or kindred of the per&s;on &s;lain, who carry him to the place of execution, and without any compa&s;&s;ion torture him to death.</P>
<P>I remember the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> had a Favourite, who falling in love with a young <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gentleman, would needs endeavour to have the u&s;e of his body. One day meeting upon the Road together, and lying at night under the &s;ame Tent, the Favourite about midnight came to his bed &s;ide, and after many &s;ollicitations would have forc'd him. But being violently re&s;i&s;ted, the Favourite for madne&s;s to &s;ee him di&s;appointed, and liable to be di&s;cover'd, &s;tabb'd the young Gentle|man to the heart, and fled to the Mountains. The Murther being divulg'd, the Mother, Widow and Si&s;ter of the young man repair'd to the <HI>Kan</HI> for Ju&s;tice, who willing to &s;ave his Minion, offer'd them money: but they &s;corning his proffer, threaten'd to complain to the King. The <HI>Kan</HI> being thereupon con&s;train'd to pur|&s;ue his Favourite, at length took him and &s;ent him to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> telling them that he would not judge of the Affair, but refer it to the King. The Mother, Widow and Si&s;ter immediately follow'd the Murtherer to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> and demanded Ju&s;tice of the King with that eagerne&s;s, that though the King had an inclination to have &s;par'd the <HI>Kan's</HI> Favourite for his Ma&s;ters &s;ake, he was forc'd to abandon him, and to bid them pay them&s;elves with his blood. Immediately he was carri'd to the <HI>Meydan,</HI> where the Widow fir&s;t &s;tabb'd him to the heart with a Dagger, then the Mother took her turn, and after the Si&s;ter; and then holding a Cup to receive his blood, drank every one a cup full to quench the thir&s;t of their revenge.</P>
<P>Nor are they &s;o exact in the puni&s;hment of Murther only; for they puni&s;h di&s;|orders in hou&s;es of Debauchery with a proportionable &s;trictne&s;s, of which I will give the Reader two examples. A young <HI>Hollander,</HI> coming to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> pre&s;ently put him&s;elf into a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> habit; and going in the evening to a hou&s;e of good fel|low&s;hip, met with certain <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> with whom he happen'd to quarrel, and being well beaten for his pains, thought it not convenient to &s;tay any longer where he had bin &s;o ill entertain'd. Thereupon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpreter went and complain'd to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> who inform'd the King. The King immediately &s;ent for the people that had beaten the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and ask'd them why they abus'd a &s;tranger? To which the others made an&s;wer that they &s;aw no &s;tranger, but only a man clad after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> garb. Whereupon the King told the Interpreter, that if the <HI>Dutch</HI>-man had worn his own Country habit, his Subjects dur&s;t not have abus'd him, but as the ca&s;e &s;tood, he had no rea&s;on to puni&s;h 'em.</P>

One day it happen'd that there was a great hubbub in one of tho&s;e hou&s;es of debauchery, where the woman had pro&s;tituted her own Daughter. The King in|form'd of it, commanded the Mother to be thrown headlong from a Tower: and that the Daughter &s;hould be torn a pieces by his doggs, which he keeps, a purpo&s;e for &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ements.</P>
<P>Above all things there is an extraordinary care taken for the &s;ecurity of the High-ways. For which purpo&s;e guards are &s;et at convenient di&s;tances, who are ready to pur&s;ue upon the lea&s;t noi&s;e of a Robbery, and who examin people whence they come and whither they go. If they an&s;wer not as they &s;hould, or trip in their An&s;wers, they carry them before the next Governor. Tho&s;e <HI>Radars</HI> are &s;o po&s;&s;ed over all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that you need no more then &s;end to the places where they keep &s;tation, to know what is become of any per&s;on that has committed a crime. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;cape, all the Pa&s;&s;es are &s;o well guarded. If any one endeavours to travel through the Mountains or unfrequented roads, then the <HI>Radars</HI> who are in all places, &s;eize &s;uch per&s;ons upon &s;u&s;pition, for not taking the direct road.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Caravan</HI> was one day &s;etting out from <HI>Tauris</HI> for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> a poor fellow took an occa&s;ion to rob a Cloak-bag during the hurly-burly of packing up, and &s;ted cro&s;s the fields not knowing his way: the Merchant mi&s;&s;ing his goods, complain'd to the Governour, who having &s;ought for him in vain, &s;ent order to the Guards of the High-ways, to make a &s;trict examination, and to &s;end the per&s;on to him &s;o &s;oon as they had &s;eiz'd him. In a &s;hort time the Thief was con&s;train'd to for&s;ake his Cloak-bag and to come a thwart the fields for water. Who being examin'd by the <HI>Radars</HI> why he came alone by &s;uch a by way, and not knowing what to an&s;wer, was carri'd to the Governour. He was &s;oon convicted and condemn'd to death, for Thieves find no mercy in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Only they are variou&s;ly put to death. For &s;ometimes they are ty'd to a Camels tayl by the feet, and their bellies rip't open. Sometimes they are buried alive all but their heads, and &s;tarv'd to death: in which torment they will &s;ometimes de&s;ire a Pa&s;&s;enger to cut off their heads; though it be a kindne&s;s forbidden by the Law. But the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hment of all, is when they &s;et Thief a Hor&s;e-back, with his extended Arms fa&s;ten'd to a long &s;tick behind: then larding him with lighted Candles, they &s;uffer the Candles to burn into his very bowels. Another and I met two in this mi&s;ery, who de&s;ir'd us to ha&s;ten their deaths, which we dur&s;t not do, only we gave them a Pipe of Tobacco according to their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e that &s;teal in Cities, they tye them by the heels to the tayl of a Ca|mel, and rip up their bellies: and then as the Camel drags the poor creature along the &s;treets, while one goes before him crying, <HI>The King has puni&s;h'd him for &s;uch a crime.</HI> If yet he be not dead, they hang him upon the next tree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Radars</HI> have little wages, which makes them u&s;e their Rhetorick to get what hone&s;tly they can out of the Travellers, to whom they tell long &s;tories of their care for the &s;ecurity of the highways.</P>
<P>If it happen that a Merchant be rob'd, the Governour of the Province is to make good to the Merchant whatever he has lo&s;t, according as he &s;hall make out by his Oath or his Book. Nor dare the Governors deny &s;atisfaction, fearing a complaint at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> I my &s;elf was rob'd of two Bales of goods, between <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Schiras,</HI> to the value of 1400 Pia&s;ters, but upon complaint to the Governour upon my own oath and &s;hewing him my Book, he pay'd me all my lo&s;s in gold, and gave me a pre&s;ent in wine be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The Po&s;ts or <HI>Shappars</HI> are tho&s;e that carry the Kings di&s;patches to the Gover|nours of Provinces. When they are &s;ent any whither, the Kings E&s;quire finds them a Hor&s;e, and a man that runs to the end of the Stage, to bring him back again. If the&s;e Curriers meet a Hor&s;eman upon the road, they have power to di&s;|mount him, if their own be not &s;o good, or be tyr'd: and the Hor&s;eman mu&s;t ei|ther run after his Hor&s;e, or &s;end &s;ome body to the end of the Stage. Sometimes the&s;e Curriers abu&s;ing their power, within a quarter of an hour after they have chang'd their Hor&s;e, if they meet another better mounted, they will take away his Hor&s;e too. Nor dares the Hor&s;eman re&s;i&s;t, though he be never &s;o much too &s;trong, for there is no pardon for them that lay &s;o much as a finger upon one of the&s;e <HI>Shappars;</HI> at other times they will pretend to take away a mans Hor&s;e

only to get money. But they are forbid to deal &s;o by the <HI>Franks;</HI> and I have pa&s;s'd by them, when they have &s;aid nothing to me.</P>
<P>Their Government in relation to Belly-timber is the be&s;t in the world For there is a <HI>Mohte&s;eb,</HI> who is the chief of the Government, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;et a rate upon all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by three or four more A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Every fir&s;t day of the week there is a publick Proclamation of tax upon the weight of every thing. Which A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the evening advi&s;e together again&s;t the next day whether to rai&s;e or abate the price before &s;et. This order was e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by the great <HI>Sha-Abbas,</HI> and was in his reign more punctually ob&s;erv'd then it has been &s;ince. By the by ob&s;erve, that all provi&s;ions of belly-timber are &s;old by weight and not by mea&s;ure: &s;o that you may &s;end a Child to Market; for if the Commodity be not weight, 'tis well if the buyer be &s;atisfy'd with having his money again. For if the &s;eller be di&s;cover'd to &s;ell by fal&s;e weights, they are led about the &s;treets with a <HI>Taktekolas,</HI> or a Bonnet like a Bee-hive upon their heads, and a Bell about their necks to expo&s;e 'em fir&s;t to the laughter of the people; after that they are fin'd, and receive &s;o many drubs upon the &s;oles of their feet.</P>
<P>If this good order were not ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the poor would &s;uffer very much. For the handicraft trade&s;men that work all day in &s;hops remote from their hou&s;es, where their wives are continually &s;hut up, eat nothing at noon but a little fruit in &s;ea&s;on: and then in the evening when they leave work, they go to the Market and buy for their Families boyl'd or roa&s;t meat, of which there is great plenty. Therefore are they &s;o exact, le&s;t &s;o many poor labouring men &s;hould be de|ceiv'd.</P>
<P>One day a Baker of the City came to the <HI>Kan,</HI> complaining that the Judge of the Government had &s;et too low a price upon bread, &s;o that he &s;hould be a great Io&s;er. To whom the <HI>Kan</HI> made an&s;wer, that 'twas not his bu&s;ine&s;s to alter the price: bidding him go to the Magi&s;trate that was concern'd. But the Baker belie|ving the <HI>Kan</HI> could do any thing, &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of fifty Tomans. The <HI>Kan</HI> &s;eeing the ill de&s;ign of the Baker to oppre&s;s the poor people, and the ill opinion he had of him as a &s;eller of Ju&s;tice, commanded him to be carri'd to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> and there to be drub'd upon the &s;oles of his feet till he pay'd the other fifty Tomans, which the <HI>Kan</HI> forthwith di&s;tributed to the poor, and caus'd the price of bread to be abated in&s;tead of rai&s;ing it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Manners and Cu&s;tomes of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Manners and Cu&s;toms of the people are u&s;ually corre&s;pondeut to their Religion. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> never pre&s;erve the name of their Predece&s;&s;ors, but like the <HI>Jews,</HI> for di&s;tinction &s;ake, &s;ay, &s;uch a one, the Son of &s;uch a one. When they Circumci&s;e a Child and give him a Name, they write three or four Names like Lots in Paper, which are drawn by a Child, and which the Child draws, that is the Name of the Child. The women that are barren, &s;wallow that which is cut from the Child, believing it will make them conceive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are generally very inqui&s;itive after the time to come, con&s;ulting their A&s;trologers like Oracles: The King has always two or three by him, to tell him the good or bad hour. There is an <HI>Almanac</HI> which is &s;old every year in <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> which they call <HI>Tacuim;</HI> but is indeed an Ephemerides, containing the Longi|tudes and Latitudes of the Planets, the Conjunctions and Oppo&s;itions; and other &s;uch things. This <HI>Tacuim</HI> is full of predictions about War, Sickne&s;s and Famin. It &s;ets the proper &s;ea&s;ons to put on new cloathes, to let blood, to Purge, or tra|vel, with many other in&s;tructions of the &s;ame nature. They give great credit to this <HI>Tacuim,</HI> and they that can get one, govern them&s;elves in all things according to the Rules there &s;et down. Others to know the &s;ucce&s;s of their affairs, go to
<PB N="235" REF="130">
a Doctor of the Law, and de&s;ire him to open the <HI>Al-couran,</HI> and to tell them the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alcouran</HI> is the Book of the Law, &s;o enti|tl'd for its ex|cellency, as we &s;ay, the Bi|ble.</NOTE>i&s;&s;ue of their bu&s;ine&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Thereupon the Doctor muttering &s;ome &s;trange words, opens the Book, and if he meets with affirmative commands, he declares the undertaking &s;hall pro&s;per. If negatives, he di&s;&s;wades from the enterprize. I re|member a Gardiner belonging to the Capuchin Friers, would needs go to one of tho&s;e <HI>Moullah's,</HI> to know whether he &s;hould get by an Ox that he was about to buy. Whereupon the <HI>Moullah</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd him he &s;hould reap great profit by his bar|gain: but quite contrary, the Ox dy'd upon his hands within three days, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the Gardiner. When a Capuchin tax'd the <HI>Moullah</HI> for the fal&s;ities of his pretended Art, the <HI>Moullah</HI> reply'd, that God knew that the Gar|diner would &s;pend his Money upon lewd Women, and therefore took from him the means and &s;upport of his debauchery.</P>
<P>They al&s;o u&s;e a &s;ort of divination, which is call'd <HI>Ramb&eacute;,</HI> by even or odd, the Ma&s;ters of which my&s;tery, call'd <HI>Rammals,</HI> keep Shops on purpo&s;e to delude the people. When they &s;ee people coming, they have per&s;ons &s;uborn'd on purpo&s;e; who holding out their hands &s;hut, ask the <HI>Rammal</HI> what he thinks they have in their hands. The Rammal at fir&s;t &s;eems to be at a &s;tand; throwing certain Dice, call'd <HI>Kiabetain,</HI> the &s;pecks whereof are &s;ome even, &s;ome uneven; but when there are people anough gathered together, he tells point by point how many &s;pecks his fellow-Cheat has in his hands. Who counterfeiting a&s;toni&s;hment, encourages the poor &s;illy creatures that &s;tand gazing, to &s;pend &s;omething for a lye which they &s;ell them. They al&s;o make u&s;e of the <HI>Faal;</HI> which is to open a Book, and by numbers even or odd, to progno&s;ticate good or bad fortune. In their interpretation of dreams, the Interpreter foretells the future to him that enquires conformable to what he &s;ays he &s;aw in his dream. He has a great Book lying before him, full of little Pictures and <HI>Grote&s;co</HI>-work, wherein he &s;trives to &s;hew the people &s;ome Fanta&s;m or Apparition, which they will tell you they &s;aw in the night. The&s;e cheats are u&s;ually practis'd about the Palace, where all the idle people flock together; as al|&s;o upon the Road to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> where they lye upon the Road to catch the &s;illy Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are mightily addicted to ill language, and foul-mouth'd reproaches. So that when two men fall out, in&s;tead of fighting with their fi&s;ts, they fight with their tongues, and cur&s;e one another. But they never bla&s;pheme God: for if they &s;hould hear one &s;wear, or wi&s;h them&s;elves at the Devil, they would cry out in an a&s;toni&s;hment, <HI>Is not that Fellow a fool to give him&s;elf upon tru&s;t to the Devil, and renounce&punc;Paradi&s;e?</HI> When they would affirm any thing to be true, all their Oaths are <HI>Ser-azire-&s;ha, By the King's beloved head;</HI> or, <HI>Erva pigumbir,</HI> by the Spirit of the Prophet. I remember once at <HI>Galata,</HI> walking with &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador's Servants, we &s;aw two <HI>Turks</HI> at Cuffs; after they were par|ted, one of them gave the other a thou&s;and cur&s;es; to which, the other reply'd no more than only this; I wi&s;h, &s;aid he, thy Soul may have no more repo&s;e in Paradi&s;e, than the Hat of a <HI>French</HI>-man has in this World, alluding to our manner of &s;alutation, and putting off our Hats &s;o often as we do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are naturally great Di&s;&s;emblers and Flatterers; and they make it their &s;tudy to acquire e&s;teem and applau&s;e. They love to give and receive Pre|&s;ents: more e&s;pecially to pre&s;ent the King. Which Pre&s;ents are valu'd, and ac|cording to the e&s;timate, they mu&s;t &s;end ten <HI>per cent.</HI> to the Serjeant Porter, and five <HI>per cent.</HI> to his Deputy: which, if they do not pay willingly, they are forc'd to pay: which I &s;aw the Deputy of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company forc'd to do.</P>
<P>The Luxury and the Expences of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is exce&s;&s;ive, as I have in &s;everal places ob&s;erv'd. And though it be again&s;t the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to make u&s;e of Gold or Silver-plate, which &s;ets a&s;ide that metal only for Commerce and for Mo|ney; none but the poor ob&s;erve that Law, for the rich make no &s;cruple to tran&s;|gre&s;s it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are very much accu&s;tom'd to make mutual Vi&s;its one to another at their &s;olemn Fe&s;tivals, and to wi&s;h one another good cheer, and a merry &s;ea&s;on. The more noble &s;ort &s;tay at home to expect the Vi&s;its of their&punc; Inferiors; after that they get a Hor&s;eback, and return their Vi&s;its. The <HI>Curti&s;ans</HI> continue their Vi&s;its all the year long, and going to the Noble-mens Hou&s;es, &s;tay in the great Hall till they come out of their <HI>Harams.</HI> Whither, when the Noblemen come,
<PB N="236" REF="131">
they lay their hands upon their &s;tomachs, and bow, which is their manner of &s;a|luting the Company that tarries for them. After &s;ome few Compliments, they get a Hor&s;eback, attended by all their Vi&s;itants, who accompany them to the King's Hou&s;e, in expectation of &s;ome kindne&s;s, by vertue of their favour. The favours which the King u&s;ually does to &s;uch people, is to &s;end them to the Gover|nours of Provinces with a Hawk or a <HI>Culaat,</HI> with order that the &s;aid Governours remember the Serjeant Porter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kan</HI> being advertiz'd that the <HI>Calaat</HI> is coming, he rides forth of the City to meet it, attended by all his principal Officers, the chief of the City, and the greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants. The Juglers al&s;o mu&s;t give their attendance, to|gether with the Drums and Trumpets, and all the Mu&s;ick-makers. They rendez|vouz u&s;ually in a Garden one or two leagues from the City, where the King's Me&s;|&s;enger &s;tays with the <HI>Calaat.</HI> So &s;oon as the Governour perceives him, he makes a low obey&s;ance, and a Prayer for the King; giving God thanks for that the King is pleas'd to pre&s;erve him in his memory: then he puts on the <HI>Calaat,</HI> which is according to the quality of the Governour: &s;ometimes the Robe alone; &s;ome|times Robe and Cloak: &s;ometimes Robe, Cloak, Girdle, and Bonnet; to which, if he be a Grandee, are added the Scimitar and Dagger: which method is al&s;o ob&s;erv'd toward Emba&s;&s;adors. When the <HI>Kan</HI> has put on the <HI>Calaat,</HI> he returns to the City with all his Retinue, goes to the King's Hou&s;e; for the King has a Hou&s;e in every City,) ki&s;&s;es the Columns of the Gate, and makes certain other Prayers for the pro&s;perity of the King: At length he rides home, where he makes a great Fea&s;t, &s;hewing the <HI>Calaat</HI> to all per&s;ons that come to him, who by way of complement cry <HI>Moubarek-ba&s;het,</HI> that is, <HI>may it be ble&s;t, and prove a good omen.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are not much addicted to play: for be&s;ides, that the Law forbids it; the <HI>Me&s;haldar-Ba&s;hi</HI> has a power to fine and puni&s;h Game&s;ters, as I have &s;aid already. For which rea&s;on he has &s;pies, to which the meaner &s;ort of people dare not refu&s;e entrance into their Hou&s;es: but the richer &s;ort laugh at 'em; and will give 'em nothing. Among the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Games, there is one game at Cards which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Gengef&eacute;.</HI> We have but four di&s;tinct marks upon ours, but they have eight. They al&s;o play at a kind of Che&s;s, and at <HI>Trictrac;</HI> which two Games are mo&s;t in u&s;e. The Shopkeepers play in the Streets with little Marbel-bowls, not much unlike our Childrens Bowling-&s;tones. But as for Bowling-greens, or Tennis-Courts, they know not what they mean.</P>
<P>Neither the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> nor any of the Ea&s;tern People accu&s;tom them&s;elves to walk as we do. And therefore when they &s;ee us walking to and fro together in a Garden-Ally for two or three hours together, they are amaz'd. They only &s;pread a Carpet in the faire&s;t place of the Garden, and &s;et them&s;elves down to contem|plate the verdure of the place: and if they ri&s;e, 'tis only to pull the fruit from the trees. For they love to eat what they gather them&s;elves, never caring for what others have handl'd.</P>
<P>The Men never dance, only the Women of Plea&s;ure, which are always &s;ent for to their Fea&s;ts; where they dance open-fac'd, and &s;hew a thou&s;and po&s;tures to di|verti&s;e the Company. Their juglers are every jot as good as ours; but whereas ours make u&s;e of Balls, they &s;hew their tricks with large Hen&punc;eggs. Their Dancers upon the Ropes far exceed ours. I have &s;een &s;ome of them that have ty'd a Rope to the top of a high Tower, and fa&s;ten'd the other to the ground, and then walk|ing up to the top with their counterpoi&s;es in their hands, have laid them&s;elves up|on the Rope upon their backs, and have &s;lid to the bottom with a &s;wiftne&s;s like lightning.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are altogether as &s;uper&s;titious as the <HI>Turks.</HI> Before they &s;ay their Prayers they are oblig'd to wa&s;h: every one having a Re&s;ervatory for water in his own Hou&s;e, which is always full of water. They plunge their heads in the water, wa&s;h their mouths, rub their foreheads; and if a man &s;hews them any na&s;ti|ne&s;s in the Ve&s;&s;el, there's water enough, they cry, for purification; though, if it be Pond-water, it mu&s;t be four or five foot deep. But if it be Running-water, the lea&s;t quantity in the World &s;erves to purify 'em, and render 'em fit to pray: while they ground their belief upon this maxim of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that if it &s;hould run through <HI>Pi&s;hkill,</HI> or Camels-dung, it would be &s;ufficient for purification. There is one &s;ort of wa&s;hing appointed by their Law, which is, to go to their
<PB N="237" REF="131">
Baths after they have been with their Wives; and there are &s;ome &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to go there every day. The&s;e Baths are round Chambers, &s;o clo&s;e, that there is no light but what comes from little round windows made in the top of the roof. In the fir&s;t place, there is the <HI>Krofin&eacute;,</HI> which is a Chamber &s;even or eight foot &s;quare; where, in the middle of the Room, is a great Copper plate, in the form of a flat Ba&s;on, and underneath they make a fire of Bru&s;hes or Hor&s;e-dung: &s;o that the Plate heats all the water which is in the Chamber: When it is hot enough, a &s;ervant belonging to the Bath goes up to the Terras, and winds a horn, to give notice to them that have a mind to come. Should a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or a <HI>Mahu|metan</HI> mi&s;s once in eight days, he would feel an itching all over his body not to be endur'd. For the pores, which the heat of the Bath had open'd, coming to be &s;hut, the vapours of the body not able to get out, prick and tickle the skin. The Men go early in the morning, and &s;tay till two hours after Sun-ri&s;ing: At the en|try of the Bath is the place where they undre&s;s; and when they are &s;tript all but the &s;ecret parts, which they cover with a napkin, they pour hot water upon their &s;houlders: and then comes a man and rubs off all the &s;weat and filth of the Body with a coar&s;e Cloath; after which they plunge them&s;elves into a Re&s;ervato|ry of hot water, which they call <HI>Kolletain.</HI> But the&s;e common Baths are very dangerous, and many people of both Sexes have got the foul Di&s;ea&s;e, who were never addicted to impurity.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> hir'd people, which they call <HI>Saka's,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to give water to the people as they go along the Streets. Their Barbers are very neat, and &s;urpa&s;s ours for lightne&s;s of hand; for a man can hardly feel their Ra|&s;ors. They have al&s;o a Knife to pare the nails of the hands and feet, which they do very dextrou&s;ly. As for their Beards, tho&s;e that belong to the Law cut it with Sei&s;&s;ers, but they leave it not &s;o long as the <HI>Turks</HI> do, by much. But the Courtiers and Souldiers &s;have all off, except from their upper-lips, where they take it for a mark of great honour to wear long <HI>Mu&s;taches,</HI> which they &s;ay is the ornament of the face.</P>
<P>The habit of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is a Robe which they call <HI>Gabaye,</HI> that comes down a little below their knees. This is of very fine quilted Cloath, well cotton'd in the Winter, but much thinner in the Summer. The&s;e Linnens would be very cheap, but that the Per&s;ons of Quality change their Robes every day. Their Sleeves are long, and clo&s;e to their arms, and reaching as far as the wri&s;t. The Robe is fit to their Bodies as far as the Wa&s;t; but then it is made wide and loo&s;e&punc; Over this they wear a noble Girdle of Silk, adorn'd at the end with flowers of Gold, over which they wear another Girdle of fine <HI>Kerman</HI> wool. The richer &s;ort are &s;o vain as to wear three Girdles, two of Silk, and one of <HI>Kerman</HI>-wool, which is ty'd uppermo&s;t. Under the Robe or Va&s;t they wear a &s;hort Wa&s;tcoat of flower'd Fu&s;tion quilted, their Shirts being of Silk of divers colours. They u&s;e as little Soap in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as they can&punc; for Soap is very rare in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> When we come out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> we are forc'd to bring with us Linnen enough to &s;erve us for &s;ix months, and then carry it back again; for they wa&s;h much better in <HI>In|dia</HI> then in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Their breeches being of Silk, come down to their Ankles, without any codpieces. Their <HI>Se&s;&s;e,</HI> or Bonnet, which we call a <HI>Turban,</HI> is made of a piece of fine Silk mingl'd with Gold, being in form much like our large Pompions: the top thereof is a little flat; and here it is that the end of the Silk being garni&s;h'd with flowers of Gold and Silver, ends in a kind of Po&s;ie. The&s;e Bonne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> are very heavy, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are for the mo&s;t part nothing but Gold and Silver. The meane&s;t of tho&s;e is worth 200 Crowns; but there are &s;ome which the King and the great Lords wear, that are worth four or five hundred. You &s;hall &s;eldom meet an Officer of any Quality that does not wear a rich Jewel in his Bonnet. The Courtiers and Souldiery wear their Daggars upon their &s;tomachs, &s;tuck in their girdles. The meane&s;t Souldier inlays the handle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">heath of his Dagger; but the Grandees have them all be&s;et with Pearls. There was in the handle of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the Second's Dagger, a Diamond of above &s;ixty Carats, which, with &s;ome other Stones that belong'd to it, was valu'd at 13000 <HI>Tomans,</HI> or 200000 Crowns. Over their Ve&s;t they wear a Ju&s;ticoar, much like ours. It is fa&s;ten'd at the top with a button: and mo&s;t u&s;ually they have nine tufted buttons before &s;et by three and three at an equal di&s;tance: but they only
<PB N="238" REF="132">
&s;erve for ornament. This Ju&s;ticoar is either of Cloath, or Ti&s;&s;ue; which in Win|ter is lin'd with <HI>Martins,</HI> or el&s;e with a grey Lambskin that comes from <HI>Kora&s;an.</HI> And indeed the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> love diver&s;ity of colours in their habits: for their Ju&s;ticoar is of one colour, their Ve&s;t of another, their Breeches of another; and their Shooes, e&s;pecially the Womens are green, red, yellow, or violet. The Girdle and <HI>Turban</HI> are always of &s;trip'd Stuff, unle&s;s it be the <HI>Moullah's,</HI> which are always plain.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, in the Winter they wear a long Cloak down to their heels, with &s;leeves of the &s;ame length, lin'd with rich Furs. The Per&s;ons of Quality, and &s;ome of the meaner &s;ort of people make no more of Cloath of Gold and Silver, then we do of Druggets. A man that has but &s;even or eight <HI>Tomans</HI> a year, &s;hall &s;pend five in Cloaths; which exce&s;s in habit is crept down among the Rabble, &s;o that a man can hardly tell the Servant from the Ma&s;ter. And it is a Proverb among the <HI>Per&s;ians, Corbeb&eacute; Lebas,</HI> fine Cloaths make Men e&s;teem'd at Court. Neither <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the Second, nor his Grandfather <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the Fir&s;t, would allow of this di&s;order, but that Men &s;hould go clad according to their conditions. For one day, &s;eeing one of his Servants with a pair of Cloath of Gold-breeches, deman|ded what wages he had? but when he under&s;tood that it was nothing neer &s;ufficient to maintain him at that rate; to deter others from the like vanity, he order'd him &s;o many <HI>Ba&s;tinadoes</HI> upon the &s;oles of his feet, that he dy'd in a few days. Others &s;ay that the Fellow being &s;urpriz'd at the King's Que&s;tion, made him an&s;wer, that being troubl'd with the Gout, he had been advis'd to wear that &s;ort of Stuff for its warmth. To which the King reply'd, that he had been told a very bad remedy, and that he would &s;hew him a better and a &s;horter way to cure the Gout, and &s;o commanded him to be drubb'd, as before is rela|ted.</P>
<P>In regard it is very cold in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they make u&s;e of three &s;orts of Furs. The Lamb and Fox's skin for the meaner &s;ort, together with the Cat's and Fox's skin. But the third &s;ort, which is the <HI>Martin's</HI> Fur, is for Grandees of the Court, and other Per&s;ons of high Quality. They have al&s;o a way to make Ca&s;&s;ocks that will keep out the rain, the wind, and the cold, which are made of <HI>Kerman</HI>-wool, as our Felt-makers make their Hats.</P>
<P>And now I have &s;aid 'tis cold, give me leave to tell ye how they warm them|&s;elves. In all Hou&s;es there are little Chambers, in the middle whereof there is a &s;quare hole about a foot deep, and three or four foot long, according to the bigne&s;s of the Chamber. Over the hole is a thing like one of our <HI>Tabourets,</HI> which covers the hole with a large Carpet, to keep in the heat of that which is kindl'd in the hole; &s;o that being plac'd under the <HI>Tabouret</HI> as far as the wa&s;t, though as cold as ice before, in a minute you &s;hall be almo&s;t in a &s;weat, and be ready to fall a-&s;leep, if you take not a great care. All the Nobility have Cham|bers with Chimneys, where they &s;et the Wood upright; the Mantle-tree comes forward, low, and &s;emi-circular. It is two or three foot deep, and as many wide, to avoid &s;moaking.</P>
<P>They are full of their Compliments, which they call <HI>Travezea:</HI> and their man|ner of &s;alutation is quite different from ours. For they never uncover their heads, but bow, and lay their right-hand upon their bre&s;ts. When they come into the company of their Betters, they fall upon their knees to &s;et them&s;elves upon their heels, which is a mark of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Women in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are very richly habited; but their habit is all of a piece, though little different in &s;hape from the Mens. It is open before and comes not down below the calf of the leg. Their Girdle is not ty'd fa&s;t, but hangs carele&s;ly: their Sleeves are al&s;o clo&s;e to their arms, and reach to their wri&s;ts. Upon their heads they wear a little Bonnet rais'd like a little &s;pire, and adorn'd with precious Stones, according to their Quality; from which Bonnet falls a veil behind, which is very graceful. They wear Breeches like the men, and their Shooes are almo&s;t like theirs. The Women of <HI>Ormus</HI> wear only a &s;in|gle pair of Breeches with a &s;hift over them. The <HI>Armenian</HI> Women wear be&s;ides, a little Ju&s;ticoar without &s;leeves, and upon their heads, a fine Linnen-Coi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ty'd under their chins. Their hair is gather'd into a long tre&s;s, to which they &s;ometimes add more, which is fal&s;e, to make a long lock, that is done
<PB N="239" REF="132">
up in a Velvet or Sattin-Ca&s;e embroider'd, and hangs behind down to the wa&s;t.</P>
<P>Hand&s;ome Women are very plentiful in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as well the tawny as the white. For the Merchants that bring both from all parts, choo&s;e the hand&s;ome&s;t they can pick out. The white Women are brought from <HI>Mu&s;covia, Poland, Cira&s;&s;ia, Mengrelia, Georgia,</HI> and the Frontiers of <HI>Tartary.</HI> The black from the coa&s;t of <HI>Melinda,</HI> and the Red-Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Women are &s;een by none but their own Husbands. They are very idle in their Hou&s;es, not &s;o much as looking after any thing of Hou&s;ewifery. In|deed every thing is at the Husband's di&s;po&s;al, &s;o that the Women are rather Slaves then Wives. They &s;pend their time in taking Tobacco, after &s;everal fa&s;hions. When they go to the Baths, &s;he's the Woman that wears the be&s;t Clothes, and brings the be&s;t Collation. They that have Slaves, cau&s;e 'em to rub their arms, their legs, and their thighs, till they fall a&s;leep; having no other diverti&s;ement in their voluptuous Pri&s;on. The higher a man is in dignity, the more he glories in having a great number of Wives and Slaves; and his ab&s;olute power keeps them in order either willingly, or by con&s;traint.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of Eunuchs for the guard of the Sultane&s;&s;es and the Wives of the Nobility: Some are white, but they never come neer the Women, but are order'd to guard the fir&s;t doors of the <HI>Haram.</HI> The others are black, frightful to look upon, and flat-nos'd: who attend only upon the Women. If there be a nece&s;&s;ity for a Woman of Quality to go abroad, the Eun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">hs go before and be|hind with Battoons in their hands, to make the <HI>Corrouk,</HI> and drive all the people out of the way. When the King goes into the Countrey, if any one be a&s;leep in the high-way, and be perceiv'd before he wakens, he is immediately cut to pieces as he lies. In the time of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the Second, one of the Fellows that help'd to &s;et up the Womens Tents, being weary, fell a&s;leep in one of them upon the ground. When the Women came, they, &s;eeing a man a&s;leep, &s;et up a &s;hrieking; upon which, the Eunuchs coming in, wrapt up the Fellow in the Carpet as he lay, and carrying him into the Fields, buried him alive, Carpet and all.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Di&s;ea&s;es of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the manner of curing them.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Children are &s;eldom &s;ick of the &s;mall-Pox, but in lieu of that, they are very &s;ubject to Scald-pates, till ten or twelve years old. Which, it may be, proceeds from their &s;having &s;o young, and &s;o often: for they &s;have at five or &s;ix months old, and two or three times a week.</P>
<P>As to the Pox, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> would be more troubl'd with it, but that the dry Air of the Countrey is an enemy to it: be&s;ides, they never lye twice with the &s;ame Woman, without going to the Bath to &s;weat out the venom of that di&s;temper. As for the Gout, or Gravel, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> know not what it means: But the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> are troubl'd with the latter, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that in their youth accu&s;tom'd them&s;elves to drink more Wine then Water.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e that are troubl'd with the Cholick, they u&s;ually pre&s;cribe the eating of Hor&s;e-fle&s;h; and I have &s;een many cur'd by that means.</P>
<P>Generally the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> e&s;pecially the rich, or tho&s;e that have wherewithal to live hand&s;omely, are much le&s;s &s;ubject to Sickne&s;s then the people of <HI>Europe.</HI> Some take the rea&s;on to be, becau&s;e of their <HI>China</HI>&punc;drink which they drink every Spring, boyling an ounce in three pints of water, and &s;o continuing the Do&s;e for ten or twelve days one after the other: all which time they keep a very moderate diet, and eat no fruit for a month together. This drink cau&s;es the Patient to &s;weat; and the &s;weat being wip'd off, dyes the Linnen, nay the very walls of the Cham|ber of a yellow colour. As for any method of Phy&s;ick, they have none in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="133">
For the <HI>Dy&s;entery,</HI> they take &s;ower Curdl'd-milk, with Rice unbruis'd boyl'd in water, to which they add a little Rhubarb powder'd.</P>
<P>At the beginning of a Di&s;ea&s;e they forbid Bread, and in&s;tead thereof pre&s;cribe Rice boyl'd in Hen-broath, or &s;ometimes in fair water. For diet is the chief Re|medy which the Phy&s;itians pre&s;cribe in all Di&s;ea&s;es, and account mo&s;t &s;overaign. Indeed the remedy is well pre&s;crib'd in many di&s;tempers; however it is by them never pre&s;crib'd according to rea&s;on or method, but only according to cu&s;tom; whereby it often comes to pa&s;s that they forbid that which is good, and pre&s;cribe that which is bad. If the Patient be &s;o poor as not to be able to &s;end for a Phy&s;itian, two or three men &s;et him upon an A&s;s, with a Scarf about his neck, which denotes him to be a &s;ick per&s;on, and &s;o lead him to the Phy&s;itian; who pre&s;ently feels his Pul&s;e, lets him Blood, and by and by taking his Pen in his hand, in a &s;mall piece of Paper pre&s;cribes more Hog-wa&s;h at one &s;troke, then three mens bellys are able to contain.</P>
<P>When a Phy&s;itian is call'd to a Con&s;ulation, he pretends not to take any Money: But his <HI>Atar</HI> or Apothecary finds a way to have the Doctor &s;atisfi'd for his pains. They never permit the Sick to change their Linnen, how na&s;ty &s;oever it be. When they come home to the Patient, though they find him ready to expire, they tell the Servants that he will certainly recover; but then, on the other &s;ide, they go to the Parents or Kindred of the Patient, and tell them that the Patient is in a de&s;perate condition, and cannot live. By this means they &s;ave their credit; for happen what will, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> have told truth either of the one &s;ide, or the other.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the divi&s;ion of Time among the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> divide the natural day into four parts. The fir&s;t is from Sun|ri&s;ing to Noon; the Second from Noon to Sun-&s;et: The third from Sun-&s;et till Midnight; and the fourth from Midnight till Sun-ri&s;e. At Midnight, Morning, and Sun-&s;et, they make a mo&s;t horrible din in every great City, of Kettle-Drums, Haut-boys, Latten-Ba&s;ons, and other In&s;truments: upon which there are certain men hir'd to play for a quarter of an hour together, in &s;ome place where they may be heard all over the City. They have al&s;o great Cornets, about &s;even foot long, with deep mouths, which may be heard above half a league. But the&s;e Cornets are never us'd but in Cities where the <HI>Kans</HI> or Governours re&s;ide. The&s;e In&s;truments are al&s;o always employ'd at their great Solemnities; as al&s;o when the King creates any new Officer or Governour. The&s;e In&s;truments have al&s;o a pri|viledg to play at all Hou&s;es where they under&s;tand there is a Male-child born. The meaner &s;ort dare not refu&s;e 'em; but the Nobility value not their priviledg of a &s;traw.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in the computation of time make u&s;e of Lunar-months.

<P>In their A&s;tronomical Accounts, and the Calculations of the Longitude and La|titude of the Planets for the compo&s;ing their Almanacks, they make u&s;e of Solar|months, thus call'd: <HI>Azar</HI> 31 day. <HI>Onzon</HI> 30 days. <HI>Ajar</HI> 31. <HI>Harizon</HI> 30. <HI>Te|mouz&eacute;</HI> 31. <HI>Ab</HI> 31. <HI>Eiloul</HI> 30. <HI>Techrion-el-Avel</HI> 31. <HI>Techrion-el-ilani</HI> 30. <HI>Ranon-el-Avel</HI> 31. <HI>Kanon-El&s;ani</HI> 31. <HI>Shaabat</HI> 28 or 29, an&s;wering to our <HI>February.</HI> The fir&s;t month <HI>Azar</HI> begins upon our eleventh of <HI>March:</HI> &s;o that it an&s;wer'd to our month of <HI>March</HI> before the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Reformation.

<P>The day of the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI> is the fir&s;t day of the year, which they call <HI>Neo|zonze,</HI> and is one of their Principal Fe&s;tivals.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Fea&s;ts and ordinary Diet of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are nothing eager after delicacies or dainties; both the nobler and the meaner &s;ort being very temperate in dyer. In regard that wood is &s;o &s;carce and dear about <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> they never eat boyl'd meat above once a day: and as for their Dinner which they call <HI>Shate,</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts of bread, chee&s;e-curds, milk, burnt wine, melons and other fruits in &s;ea&s;on, to which the rich add wet and dry &s;weet-meats: At night their u&s;ual food is <HI>Pilaw</HI> and ro&s;t meat. They buy their Provi&s;ion from hand to mouth, e&s;pecialy the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> which is a double charge. But for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they live thriftily, and buy at once a good quan|tity of provi&s;ions to la&s;t for &s;o long time.</P>
<P>Muttons, Kidds, Pullets and Pidgeons, are the u&s;ual dyet of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> for as for Beef they very rarely eat it. The King and the great Lords will eat a piece of a Hare &s;ometimes when they have been a hunting: but when they have kill'd a wild Boar, they &s;end it always to &s;ome Chri&s;tian, in expectation to be pre&s;ented for the honour done him. They have no diver&s;ity of Victuals or made Di&s;hes in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> their dyet being more proper to &s;atisfie&punc;hunger, then to plea&s;e a nice palate. Mutton and Lamb would be very good in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> if they knew how to roa&s;t it our way. But the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> roa&s;t only at an oven, which is a hole made in the ground two foot and a half broad, and five or &s;ix foot deep. They burn nothing but bu&s;hes, and a kind of Turf mix'd with the dung of Cattel, and dry'd in the Sun. There are &s;everal roa&s;ting Cooks at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> that roa&s;t a whole Sheep at a time where he that comes to buy may have as much cut out as he plea&s;es. Other Cooks &s;hops are only for boyl'd meat or rice: their fruits which they pickle up in Vinegar being the only &s;awce which they have.</P>
<P>As for their Bread it is very white, for they have wheat enough to furni&s;h the whole Kingdom. They bake every day, making up their Dow in the form of a thin Cake, &s;trow'd over with <HI>Se&s;amum.</HI> They bake the&s;e Cakes in their Ovens in the ground, covering the batch over with little round flint &s;tones, that are quick|ly hot and retain the heat. At <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> they make a great fire in an earthen pot, and when it is hot they &s;pread the Dow again&s;t the &s;ides of the pot. The <HI>Ar|menians</HI> make a &s;ort of bread as thin as Paper, which they bake upon a thin Iron plate which is as thin as Paper. Their Plate and Di&s;hes are of red Copper tinn'd within &s;ide. For they are forbid to make u&s;e of Silver by the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Nor does the King u&s;e any other then Gold Plate, of which he has great &s;tore. They have al&s;o a &s;ort of <HI>Porcellane</HI> made at <HI>Kerman.</HI> To eat their broths they make u&s;e of wood'n&punc;&s;poons: for as for their rice, which is thick, they take it up in their fingers, and wipe their hands upon their handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing &s;et upon the Table is the Pipe, the Tobacco, and the di&s;h of
<PB N="242" REF="134">
Coffee; and indeed thus it is that they begin all their debauches. They &s;uck and &s;moak of their Tobacco through water in a long gla&s;s bottel, by which means it comes cool into their mouths: el&s;e they would never be able to take it all day long as they do. They &s;ing very little in their Cups: but they recite a va&s;t num|ber of wicked Ver&s;es, which they rehear&s;e with a great deal of gravity. They are &s;o accu&s;tomed to take Tobacco, both men and women, that a poor trade&s;man that has not above five <HI>Sous</HI> to &s;pend, will lay out three of them in Tobacco. If they had none, they &s;ay that they &s;hould not have <HI>damaque,</HI> that is, gladne&s;s in their hearts. Many will confe&s;s that their exce&s;&s;ive taking Tobacco is hurtful; but if you tell 'em of it, they an&s;wer in a word, <HI>Adedehoud, 'Tis the cu&s;tome.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides their Tobacco they have al&s;o <HI>Opium</HI> made of Poppies, cut as they grow, out of which they draw the juice and make it into Pills. They take no more at fir&s;t then the head of a pin, increa&s;ing their do&s;e by degrees, till they come to take the quantity of half a wall-nut. When they are come to that pitch they dare not give over, for fear of endangering their lives, or addicting them&s;elves to drink wine. In their youth you &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e <HI>Theriakis</HI> or <HI>takers of Opium,</HI> with pale pen&s;ive and dejected countenances, and the u&s;e of their &s;peech almo&s;t lo&s;t: If they omit to take for a day together this ill continued drug that heats their brains, and cau|&s;es them to act ridiculou&s;ly and to talk&punc;idly, when it has done working, they are as cold and &s;tupid as before, which obliges 'em to take it&punc;again. For this rea&s;on they are &s;hort liv'd: or if they do live till forty, they complain heavily of the pains that proceed from the cold venome of the herb. They that have a mind to kill them&s;elves, &s;wallow a large piece, and drink Vinegar after it, to prevent the re|lief of any other Counterpoy&s;on, and &s;o they dye &s;miling.</P>
<P>They have another &s;ort of drink to make them&s;elves merry, which thy call <HI>Kokemaar,</HI> compos'd of boyl'd Poppy &s;eed. They take it in broth, and there are particular hou&s;es call'd <HI>Kokemaar Krone,</HI> where people meet to diverti&s;e tho&s;e that &s;ee the ridiculous po&s;tures which that intoxicating drink cau&s;es them to &s;hew. Before it works they quarrel with one another, and call one another all to naught, but never fight. When the drug begins to work, they grow friends; and &s;ome are for making complements, others for telling a long tedious &s;tory, wnich renders them very vain. They have al&s;o another &s;ort of liquor, which is call'd <HI>Bongue,</HI> very bitter, being made of the leaves of Hemp and &s;ome other drug mix'd with it, It makes tho&s;e that u&s;e it &s;hamefully fooli&s;h and ridiculous, which is the rea&s;on the Law has forbid that and not the former. The <HI>&V;sbecks</HI> have brought into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Cu&s;tome of taking in Pipes <HI>Tchouher&s;e,</HI> which is the flower or rather the woolly &s;ub&s;tance which is found in hemp-clo&s;es. This fills the heads with &s;trange conceits, &s;ometimes plea&s;ant and &s;ometimes furious; tho&s;e that take it being quite be&s;ides their &s;ences for two or three hours.</P>
<P>Their Fea&s;ts are thus order'd: The gue&s;ts come in the morning to the hou&s;e whither they are invited and all the day long they &s;pend their time in taking To|bacco and telling &s;tories. Between whiles they have Sweetmeats, Coffee, and Fruits &s;et before them. In the evening the <HI>Sofra</HI> is &s;pread, and the table &s;erv'd with boil'd and roa&s;t. If the per&s;on that treats be of any quality, he has a kind of a Governour of his hou&s;e, that &s;its upon his heels with a Ladle or great wood|en &s;poon in his hand. Then the Inviter makes his complements to the chief of his gue&s;ts, a&s;&s;uring him that the entertainment is only provided for him, only at his command he is ready to let the re&s;t &s;hare with him. The Complements being thus pa&s;s'd, the Governour of the Hou&s;e with his great Spoon puts rice and meat upon the little plates, which the &s;ervants pre&s;ent by equal portions to every one of the gue&s;ts. Then they fall to, taking out the rice by handfuls, and the meat with their fingers. Sometimes they mix curdl'd milk with their rice and meat, and making up a lump of all together as big as a Ten|nis ball, put it all in their mouths at a time, which is the rea&s;on they never &s;it long at Table; one making room for another till they have all done: for as &s;oon as one has done, another comes into his place without any farther Ceremony. They have &s;everal Liquors in the room in <HI>Porcellain</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, but at meals they only drink to drive down their meat and to prevent thir&s;t. When all is done, they bring a Ba&s;on with an Ewre full of hot water to wa&s;h their hands and faces. After which the Inviter complements his gue&s;ts, and every one returns home; at which
<PB N="243" REF="134">
time the &s;ervants are very diligent to bring every man his &s;hoes, in hopes of &s;ome little piece of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> entertain their friends in the &s;ame manner, only that they be|gin their Fea&s;ts with a cup of &s;trong water, and &s;ome &s;weet-meats, after which they give a couple of hard Eggs to every one of the gue&s;ts. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o have &s;oon done, but the <HI>Armenians</HI> eat &s;wift, and a long time without drinking, which they never do till the end of the meal. After they have given thanks and taken away the cloth, then they fall to drinking to exce&s;s. He that gives the enter|tainment never thinks he has done well, till his gue&s;ts are not able to find the way out of the room, and the more they tumble about the room, the le&s;s he thinks he has &s;pent his money in vain.</P>
<P>To conclude, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are very Gentile, and afford their victuals with a free|will to all that will come and eat with them at Supper time: admiring at the cu&s;tome of the <HI>Franks,</HI> who &s;hut their doors when they &s;it down to their meals.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Marriages of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> betroth their Children very young, that is at nine or ten years; but among the <HI>Armenians</HI> there are &s;ome marry'd and lye together at five or &s;ix. The Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> allows them but four lawful Wives, whom they call <HI>Nekha.</HI> But there are others whom they call <HI>Amoutha</HI> or hir'd women, and of whom they may have as many as they can keep, and for &s;o long time as they plea&s;e, which is ratifi'd by the allowance of the Judg. They may al&s;o enjoy the Slaves whom they purcha&s;e. The Children both of the one and the other are ac|compted lawful, and inherit all alike, without the di&s;tinction of Elder or Younger; but two Daughters can have but the &s;hare of one boy. When the womans time that was hir'd is out, the man di&s;mi&s;&s;es her, and &s;he is oblig'd to &s;tay forty days before &s;he engage again, that it may appear whither &s;he be with Child or no.</P>
<P>The man gives to the woman that he marries a Dowry a&s;&s;ign'd upon his E&s;tate, and &s;ends her money and &s;ilks to make her cloaths. The maid al&s;o &s;ends &s;omething to him, but very little, and all by the interpo&s;ition and intercour&s;e of the women. For the two parties never &s;ee one another. Upon the wedding day, they &s;end to the Bridegrooms hou&s;e, by the &s;ound of Drums and Trumpets, certain Hor&s;es and Men laden with the Brides goods, which is many times done out of vain-glory, and more for &s;hew then &s;ub&s;tance. The Bridegroom is led a foot, attended by &s;e|veral women with Tapers in their hands, and a noi&s;e of Drums and other In&s;tru|ments marching before them. Being come to the door of the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e, if he have promis'd a larger Dowry to the women then he is able or willing to give, he keeps his door &s;hut. The Parents of the Maid knock, and he declares he will not have her at that price. But at length after &s;ome conte&s;ts on both &s;ides they agree, and the Virgin enters with her Mother and all her Kindred. Then the <HI>Moullah</HI> reads the conditions of Marriage; which being done, the women retire into the inner part of the Hou&s;e, the men fea&s;ting by them&s;elves, and the women by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is all that is done upon the Wedding-day, but the following days are not al|ways &s;o plea&s;ing, and it often follows that both parties do not agree, or that the husband mi&s;u&s;es his wife. Then the women that requires &s;eparation, requires the Dowry promis'd her by her husband: which the man oft-times refu&s;es, and if &s;he per&s;i&s;ts in her demand, is many times &s;o &s;everely us'd by him, that &s;he is con&s;train'd to cry, <HI>I'th Devils name let me go, I demand nothing of thee.</HI> Then they both repair to the <HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> or <HI>Cheit-Le&s;loon,</HI> who is a Doctor of the Law, and in his pre&s;ence they di&s;charge one another. This they may do by their Law three times.
<PB N="244" REF="135">
After that, the &s;ame woman can never return to her Husband again.</P>
<P>The Children derive their Nobility from the Father, whither he be born of a Slave, or an <HI>Amoutha,</HI> or a Legitimate wife. The Nobility of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> which is call'd <HI>Negabet,</HI> is founded upon their being de&s;cended from <HI>Mahomet.</HI> They who claim that extraction, have the title of <HI>Mir</HI> or Prince: and their Daughters carry the appellation of <HI>Mirza</HI> or Prince&s;s. They are very numerous and very poor. But the title of <HI>Mir</HI> without a good E&s;tate or high Employment &s;ignifies little or nothing.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Death and Burials of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIs the Cu&s;tome among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> that when the Patient lyes very dange|rou&s;ly ill, they light &s;everal fires upon the Terra&s;s of the Hou&s;e, togive the People notice to pray for him. So &s;oon as the breath is out of his body, the whole hou&s;e rings with cries and lamentations, e&s;pecially of the women who tear their hair, and &s;hew &s;uch antick po&s;tures, that a man would think them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd&punc; In the mid&s;t of their tears they make long repetitions of the worthy actions of the deceas'd, and every foot they &s;et up a yelling. Then they go and advertize the <HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> that &s;uch a one is dead; to whom the <HI>Ca&s;i</HI> an&s;wers <HI>Sorchoama Salamet-Ba&s;het. May your head be in &s;afety.</HI> In the mean while he &s;eals a Licence to the <HI>Mour|derehour,</HI> to take the body and wa&s;h it in a hou&s;e which is built on purpo&s;e near a running water. After that come a great number of <HI>Moullah's,</HI> with the En&s;igns of the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which are long &s;taffs like Pikes, at the end whereof are thin plates of Iron and Latten, &s;o weak that they bend downward with the lea&s;t motion: the bodies of the &s;taves being wrapt about with certain pieces of Taffata. The&s;e <HI>Moul|lahs</HI> tear their throats crying out <HI>Alla, Alla, Alla,</HI> repeating nothing el&s;e, and dancing &s;ometimes upon one foot and &s;ometimes upon another; and becau&s;e they that baul loude&s;t get the mo&s;t money, they put their thumbs in their ears with their fingers upon their cheeks, and tear their throats with all the force they have. The body being wa&s;h'd, the cloaths of the deceas'd belong to the <HI>Mourderchour.</HI> When they carry the Beire, it is the cu&s;tome that every one that meets it, prof|fers their &s;houldiers to help carry, while the others ca&s;e them&s;elves; for which the Kindred of the deceas'd make &s;ome acknowledgment. If he be a per&s;on of Quality, all his Hor&s;es are bridl'd and &s;addl'd, and others perhaps borrow'd: One carries his Turban, another his Scimitar, another his Bow, another his Arrows, another his Buckler, and whatever el&s;e is of any u&s;e to &s;et forth his Quality and his Courage. The bigge&s;t Church-yard that belongs to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is <HI>Calre&s;ton;</HI> but there is not one hand&s;ome Tomb in it. The <HI>Armenians</HI> lay a great &s;tone over the grave, and the rich &s;et up an Arch with four Pillars, under which they eat and drink in the &s;hade when they vi&s;it the Tombs of their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Their graves are &s;ix foot long, &s;ix foot deep, and two foot wide, wherein they lay the bodies with their faces turn'd toward <HI>Mecca;</HI> and then they &s;et up two tiles of each &s;ide his face to keep the earth from falling upon it. If he be a rich man, or have been a &s;tout Souldier, they bury with him his Turbant, Scimitar, Bow and Arrows, and &s;et Victuals by him; which part of the hole being made up with bricks, the re&s;t is fill'd up with earth. The <HI>Moulla's</HI> alone return to the hou&s;e of the deceas'd, where they have meat &s;et before 'em, and are al&s;o farther pay'd for their &s;inging and bawling. A while after the Kindred coming to vi&s;it the Heir, di&s;cour&s;e him upon the contempt of the world, tell him that it is but as a <HI>Caravan,</HI> &s;ome of which arrive &s;ooner at their Journeys end then others. Eight days after the Heir returns their vi&s;its. As for the Grandees they order in their Wills that their bodies &s;hall be either carry'd to <HI>Mecca</HI> or <HI>Me&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>As well the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as the <HI>Turks&punc;</HI> believe that as &s;oon as the grave is fill'd, that the two Angels <HI>Neguir</HI> and <HI>Manguer,</HI> revive the dead as far as his wa&s;t; ask him

the rea&s;on of Faith, and which way he &s;aid his Prayers, and that according to his merits they u&s;e him well or ill. As for the torment of Souls before the Re&s;ur|rection, that only con&s;i&s;ts in a grief for not having arriv'd to tho&s;e perfections and Sciences to which they might have attain'd&punc; and con&s;equently for not having attain'd to that perfection which God requir'd of them. Otheres hold that the Souls of the unfortunate are tormented with Dreams and Vi&s;ions; but that the Souls of the happy always enjoy the &s;ight of plea&s;ing objects; till the <HI>Saheb-el|zaman,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of time &s;hall come to c&oacute;nfirm the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who &s;hall kill <HI>Dedgar,</HI> who is like our <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> with his own hand; at which time all then alive &s;hall dye in an in&s;tant, and then &s;hall happen the general Re&s;urrection, which they call <HI>Moavedet-hechre.</HI> That the &s;ame Bodies and Souls &s;hall unite to appear at the day of Judgment before the Throne of the great Judge of the world; and that to go thither they mu&s;t pa&s;s over a bridge call'd <HI>Pol&s;erat,</HI> &s;har|per then the edge of a razor, which neverthele&s;s the Mu&s;&s;ulmen &s;hall pa&s;s over without any danger with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a bird.

<P>I Set forth out of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the 24. of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1665. in the afternoon, and &s;tai'd a League from the City, in a field whither &s;ome of my friends would needs ac|company me. About ten a clock at night, I &s;et forward again, and travell'd till break of day; and then I came to a place where the <HI>Radars</HI> kept guard half a league from a great Town call'd <HI>I&s;p&s;haneck,</HI> which you are to cro&s;s. About ten a clock in the forenoon I came to <HI>Mahiar,</HI> where there is a very good Inn. But the Land between this and <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is all very barren and without wood.</P>
<P>The 26<HI>th,</HI> three hours after midnight, I &s;et forward through a dry Plain, which begins to grow more fruitful, about a Leagues from <HI>Com&s;he</HI> a great City, where I arriv'd by eleven a Clock in the morning. In it are &s;everal Inns, and indifferent hand&s;ome ones, con&s;idering that they are built only of Earth. This City is com|pos'd of a row of Villages that extend about half a League in length. About three quarters of a League on this &s;ide the City &s;tands a neat <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> with a pond full of fi&s;h. But the <HI>Moullahs</HI> will not permit you to catch any, &s;aying that they belong to the Prophet to whom the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> is dedicated.

<P>The 28<HI>th</HI> I departed two hours after midnight, and after eight hours travel through a barren plain, I arriv'd at <HI>Ye&s;decas,</HI> a little City built upon a rock in the mid&s;t of a great Valley, and lodg'd in an Inn at the foot of the Rock. The &s;ame day in the morning I pa&s;s'd on to a neat hou&s;e with fine Gardens call'd <HI>Amnebad;</HI> built by <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</HI> Governor of <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> I departed an hour after midnight, and a little after I cro&s;s'd a &s;hort mountain, but &s;o rugged and &s;o craggie, that they have given it the name of <HI>Kotel-Innel-tebekeni,</HI> that is <HI>the Mountain that breaks the Hor&s;es &s;hoes.</HI> The next day we pa&s;s'd by a &s;curvy Ca&s;tle call'd <HI>Gombe&s;&s;ala;</HI> then travelling through a flat Country, I came by ten in the morning to <HI>Dehigherdou,</HI> or the Village of Wall-nuts. I endur'd very &s;harp weather all the morning, for all that Country, and that which I travell'd the next day, is very cold at &s;ome times of the year.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day, I travel'd from midnight till ten a clock in the morning, through the Snow over a barren Plain to come to <HI>Cuzkuzar,</HI> where there is a new Inn well built.</P>
<P>The third, I rode a hor&s;eback from five in the morning till noon, fir&s;t over the &s;ame Plain by a Lake &s;ide in a very bad way cover'd with &s;now that hid the holes; then pa&s;&s;ing a tedious long and rugged mountain, I de&s;cended to a Village call'd <HI>A&s;epas,</HI> where there is to be &s;een an old ruin'd Ca&s;tle upon the point of a Hill. The Inhabitants were all <HI>Georgians</HI> by de&s;cent, but now turn'd all <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> I met with wine and fi&s;h, in regard of the many Rivolets, but the <HI>Caravan&s;ira</HI> is old, and ill provided.</P>
<P>The fourth, &s;etting out by day-break, I rode over a Plain, which <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the fir&s;t gave the <HI>Georgians</HI> to till, and in eleven hours I came to <HI>Ondgiom,</HI> a large Vil|lage upon a River, over which there is a fair &s;tone-bridge.</P>
<P>The fifth, I got a hor&s;eback by two a clock in the Morning, and had two leagues in the fir&s;t place of deep miery way; afterwards I pa&s;s'd a &s;teep Mountain, craggy and durty. I pa&s;s'd through a Village call'd <HI>Iman-Shade,</HI> from the name of one of their Prophets that lyes buried there, and gave the Mountain its name, being all cover'd with bitter Almond-trees. I travell'd &s;ometime between rude and craggy rocks, after which I met with a &s;mall River, which runs to <HI>Mayn,</HI> a little City where I lodg'd in a fair Inn.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth, I departed three hours after midnight, and travell'd through a large Plain encompa&s;s'd with high and rugged Mountains; upon one of which that is divided from the other, &s;tood a Ca&s;tle which they &s;ay was ruin'd by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, of which at pre&s;ent there does not remain the lea&s;t &s;ign or foot&s;tep. I cro&s;s'd the river of <HI>Mayne</HI> over two &s;tone Bridges, and then came to <HI>Abgherme;</HI> a place that &s;tands in a Plain where there is an Inn half built; &s;o call'd by rea&s;on of a Spring of hot waters that ri&s;es not far from it. In the morning I pa&s;s'd over a fair and long Cau&s;ey, call'd <HI>Pouligor,</HI> being above 500 paces long, and 15 broad divided al&s;o by certain Bridges, to give the water free pa&s;&s;age, by rea&s;on the Country is very full of mer&s;hes. At the end of this Cau&s;ey &s;tands an Inn very well built, but the gnats that haunt it will not &s;uffer it to be frequented. I pa&s;s'd along by the foot of a Mountain, and after three hours travel, I &s;topp'd a while at an Inn that &s;tands at the foot of another &s;teep and craggie mountain.</P>
<P>I arriv'd at <HI>Schiras</HI> about &s;ix a clock at night. But here give me leave before I enter the City, to make two ob&s;ervations, the one touching the Road from <HI>I&s;pa|han</HI> to <HI>Schiras,</HI> the other concerning the ruins of <HI>Tche-elminar.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Road from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Scbiras,</HI> ob&s;erve that in winter time when the Snow is fallen, when you come to <HI>Ye&s;decas,</HI> you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity leave the direct road, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s the &s;treights of tho&s;e Mountains, which I have mention'd. Therefore you mu&s;t keep the left hand road ea&s;tward, through the Plains, taking a guide along with you.</P>
<P>This way, which is the longer by two days journey, was formerly unknown, becau&s;e of a River, that in one place beats upon a &s;teep rock, and clo&s;es up the pa&s;&s;age, But <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> with a va&s;t expence of time and money, caus'd a
<PB N="247" REF="136">
way to be levell'd out of the Rock about 15 or 20 foot above the River, which he &s;ecur'd to the water-&s;ide with a Wall three or four foot high. This way con|tinues for half a league, and then you come to lye at a great Village in a Plain, where you take Guides to &s;hew you the Fords of the River.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;t the River, you cro&s;s over &s;everal fertil Plains water'd with great &s;tore of Rivers. Then you a&s;cend a Mountain, from whence you have but a league and a half to <HI>Tche-elminar.</HI></P>
<P>At the point of the Mountain, upon the right-hand of the great Road, are to be &s;een twelve Pillars &s;till &s;tanding, that form a kind of a &s;quare. In the &s;paces of the Mountain are a great number of <HI>Niches,</HI> that are oppo&s;it to the Pillars, and were certainly the places where the ancient <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> put their Idols. Thence you come to <HI>Tche-elminar;</HI> where are to be &s;een a great many old Columns, &s;ome &s;tanding, and &s;ome lying upon the ground, and &s;ome ill-&s;hap'd Statues, with little four-&s;quare dark rooms. All which together, ea&s;ily per&s;wades me, who have well con&s;ider'd the principal Pagods of <HI>India,</HI> that <HI>Tche-elminar</HI> was only a Temple formerly dedicated to Idolatrous wor&s;hip. And that which confirms my opinion, is, that there is no place more proper for an Idolatrous Temple then this, by rea|&s;on of the abundance of water. Be&s;ides, that the dark Rooms could be no other then the Chambers for the Prie&s;ts; and where the Rice and Fruits that were the feigned nouri&s;hment of the Idols, were the better &s;ecur'd from gnats and flies.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Tche-elminar,</HI> you come to lye at a Village half a league farther, where is very good Wine. From thence to <HI>Schiras</HI> is a hard days journey; e&s;pecially when the Snow begins to melt: for then the Road looks like a little Sea.</P>

<P>THE City of <HI>Schiras</HI> lies in 78 degr. 15 min. of Longitude, and 29 deg. 36 min. of Latitude. It is &s;eated in a plain that extends it &s;elf about four leagues from the North to the South, and from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t about five leagues. Upon the South-ea&s;t there is a Lake of &s;alt water four leagues in com|pa&s;s: leaving the Plain as you travel to the South, you pa&s;s between two Moun|tains, which are not &s;o clo&s;e, but that they leave room for certain plea&s;ant Valleys a league and a half wide.</P>
<P>The Soil about <HI>Schiras</HI> is good, and fruitful; and it is particularly famous for the mo&s;t excellent Wines of all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> As for the City it &s;elf, there is nothing hand&s;ome in it: for it looks rather like a Town half ruin'd then a City. For|merly it was begirt with walls of Earth, which are now utterly decaid. The Hou&s;es are of the &s;ame Earth dri'd in the Sun, and whiten'd over with lime; &s;o that when it happens to rain, when the Earth comes to be well moi&s;ten'd, the Hou&s;es fall of them&s;elves. Only the Colledg which <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> built, and &s;ome of the <HI>Mo&s;quees</HI> are of Brick: and the be&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Mo&s;quees</HI> is call'd <HI>Sha-Shiranue,</HI> which out of a particular devotion is kept &s;omewhat better in re|pair. However, there is nothing in it worth taking notice of. Upon the North|ea&s;t &s;ide, the City runs within a quarter of a league of the Mountain: and from a Stone-bridg, as you go out of the City to the foot of the Mountain, is a long Street in a &s;treight line, where there &s;tands a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> built by <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan.</HI> Without, it appears fair enough; but within, it falls to ruine. There is an <HI>Octo|gonal Piazza</HI> before the Gate, and in the middle of the <HI>Piazza</HI> an <HI>Octogonal Va&s;e,</HI> which is fill'd by a little &s;tream that runs through the Street from the Mountain. Both &s;ides of the Street from the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> to the Mountain are wall'd in: and at certain &s;paces are great Gates one again&s;t another, with rooms over them; the Windows whereof open into the Gardens behind the walls: all along by which, runs a row of Cypre&s;s&punc;trees in a direct line: and in the middle of the Street
<PB N="248" REF="137">
about two hunder'd paces on this &s;ide the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> is another <HI>Va&s;e,</HI> which receives the &s;ame water as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ns from the Mountain. This Street was made by <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan,</HI> after he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d cut the Mountain at the end of it, to &s;horten the way from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>There are in <HI>Schiras</HI> three or four Gla&s;s-hou&s;es, where they make great and &s;mall Bottles, to tran&s;port the Sweet-waters that are made in the City. There are al&s;o made the &s;everal &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els wherein they pickle their fruits of all &s;orts, which they &s;end in great quantities into <HI>India,</HI> to <HI>Sumatra, Batavia,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>There is no Silk made, nor any other manufacture in <HI>Schiras:</HI> only there are &s;ome few <HI>Chites</HI> or Painted-cloaths made there, which neverthele&s;s are very coar&s;e, and in u&s;e only among the meaner &s;ort.</P>
<P>As you go out of the City upon the North-we&s;t &s;ide, you meet with a long Alley or Walk, in three parts whereof are plac'd three Stones, which they call <HI>Mills.</HI> At the end of this walk is a Garden call'd <HI>Bay-Sha,</HI> or the King's Garden. Over the Gate whereof is a great Room half ruin'd: and at the end of a large Walk planted with Cypre&s;s-trees, &s;tands a neat piece of building, but altogether neglected. Upon the left-hand whereof is a great Pond pav'd with Free-&s;tone, being all the beauties of the Garden: which, it is true, was full of Fruit|trees, Ro&s;es and <HI>Ja&s;mins;</HI> yet, for want of order, it look'd like a Wilder|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>From the Garden to the Hill is a Plain of two leagues long, and one broad; which is all but one large Vinyard belonging to &s;everal per&s;ons. Beyond the Vineyard ri&s;e very high Mountains, from whence fall &s;everal little Springs that form a River, which is call'd <HI>Bend-Emir,</HI> from the name of a Town where the bigge&s;t Spring ri&s;es. This River of <HI>Bend-Emir</HI> waters the whole Vineyard of <HI>Schiras;</HI> where it never rains from Spring till Autumn: which is the rea&s;on that in the Summer there is no water in the very Channel next the City.</P>
<P>Their Wines are the be&s;t in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> but there is not &s;o great a quantity made as people imagin. For, of all this great Vineyard, and in all the places round about the City for four or five leagues together, good part of the Grapes are dri'd, and a greater quantity pickl'd: and of the Wine, there are many Ve&s;&s;els full, which are burnt for the benefit of the poor Travellers, and Carriers, who find it a great refre&s;hment to drink it with water.</P>
<P>Their Wine, as all other things, is &s;old by weight and not by mea&s;ure. In the year 1666, a mo&s;t plentiful year for Wine, the Provi&s;ion of the King's Hou&s;e amounted to 50000 <HI>Mens</HI> of <HI>Keukn&eacute;&punc;</HI> or the ancient <HI>Men</HI> containing nine pound of ours, at &s;ixteen ounces to the pound, (being the only weight for Wine,) and the King allows as much to the <HI>Franks,</HI> as for his own Hou&s;hold. The Jews of <HI>Schi|ras,</HI> who boa&s;t them&s;elves of the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> made above a hunder'd and ten thou&s;and <HI>Mens,</HI> it being their chiefe&s;t livelihood; but the Governour of <HI>Schiras</HI> knows how to &s;hare with them in their profit. The whole account of Wine made at <HI>Schiras</HI> amounts to 200025 <HI>Mens,</HI> or 4125 Tuns, at three hunder'd pints to the Tun.</P>
<P>In <HI>Schiras</HI> is an ancient <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> wherein is the Sepulcher of a <HI>Sadi,</HI> whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> e&s;teem the be&s;t of their Poets. It has been a very fair one, accompani'd with a large Building, which was once a Colledg; but it runs to ruine, as do al&s;o many other Edifices within the City. Ju&s;t again&s;t this <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> you de&s;cend by a pair of Stairs into a large Well, at the bottom whereof is a <HI>Va&s;e</HI> full of Fi&s;h, which no body dares to touch, it being Sacriledg to rob the <HI>Sadi</HI> of what belongs to him. A little beyond this <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> upon a high Rock, &s;tand the ruines of a Ca&s;tle; and upon the top of all the Rock is a &s;quare Well cut out of the Rock. It is very deep, and ten or twelve foot broad: formerly, they told me, their Adultere&s;&s;es were all thrown into it. There is one wonderful Well in this City; which is 15 years ri&s;ing, and 15 years falling; that is, the water is one fifteen years ri&s;ing to the top, and another fifteen years &s;inking to the bottom.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Schiras</HI> two or three <HI>Bazars</HI> well built, through the mid&s;t whereof the water runs in a Channel.</P>
<P>To the South-we&s;t, a good league from the City, there is a little Hill divided from the great Mountain, upon which Hill are three Gates to be &s;een, the remain|der
<PB N="249" REF="137">
of an Idolatrous Tempel. There were four Gates, but the South-Gate is rumbl'd down: the re&s;t are &s;tanding, compos'd of three Stones: Upon both the Stones that make the Jaums, there are two figures in half Relief, with their faces one looking upon another, with their arms extended; one holding in his hand a Pan, out of which i&s;&s;ues a flame of fire; and the other a Towel folded up. The other Statue holds as it were a Pur&s;e in one hand, and a bowl of Fire in the other; the Figures being as big as the Life, only their faces are &s;poil'd; and as for the other doors, they are both the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Two Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from thence, in a plain, ri&s;es a little Mountain, from the North-&s;ide of which fall many Springs that meet in a large Pond full of Fi&s;h. Some high Trees grow there, to &s;hade the Habitation of a <HI>Dervi's</HI> that lives there. The place is plea&s;ant, and all the Springs together fill a Channel large enough to water the neighbouring Fields. Here it was that certainly the ancient Idolaters came to wa&s;h, and thence went to the Temple to &s;ay their Prayers, and make their Offerings.</P>
<P>Half a league beyond, at the foot of a Mountain, is a place about 500 paces in compa&s;s, whence there fall a good number of Springs that meet in a Pond, en|viron'd with high Trees, and full of Fi&s;h. In one corner of the Mountain &s;tand Figures, cut out of the Rock much bigger then the Life. The two which are uppermo&s;t look one upon another; and that upon the left-hand carries a large Turbant, &s;uch as the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> wears when he goes to the <HI>Divan.</HI> From his <HI>Turbant</HI> to the middle of his Forehead, he was bound with the Tre&s;&s;es of his own hair, the ends whereof were fa&s;ten'd together with large Buckles behind in his neck. His habit was a Robe after the ancient fa&s;hion, with a kind of a Cutlace by his &s;ide. Nor did the oppo&s;ite Statue much differ from this, only in&s;tead of a Turbant, he wore a kind of Miter upon his head. The two other Statues underneath the former, &s;tretch'd forth their arms one to the other: the one repre&s;enting a Man, the other a Woman. The Man &s;eem'd to pre&s;ent the Woman a No&s;egay of Flowers; but in truth it was a difficult thing to di&s;cern them, in regard they were both cover'd with a Fig-tree that grew ju&s;t be|fore them out of the Rock.</P>
<P>About two thou&s;and paces farther, there is a Lake of &s;alt water about ten leagues in compa&s;s, which is fill'd by &s;everal Springs that fall from the Mountains: and here it is that the people make a great quantity of Salt. There runs into it al&s;o a &s;alt River, over which you cro&s;s upon a large &s;tone-Bridg about three miles from <HI>Schiras,</HI> in the way to <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>Half a league from the City are two remarkable Wells: the one upon the top of the Mountain, the other upon the de&s;cent, cut out of the Rock: both of an extraordinary depth. There is no water in either, becau&s;e they are half full of Stones, which they that come to &s;ee the Wells, throw into 'em. There are al&s;o to be &s;een the Ruines of a Ca&s;tle formerly built there for the Guard of the High|ways. But &s;ince <HI>Iman-Kouli-Kan</HI> made the new way, the caus'd all tho&s;e For|tre&s;&s;es to be defac'd, as being expen&s;ive to the King, and burthen &s;ome to the Mer|chant, from whom the Guards exacted Toll in tho&s;e places. Now all the ways are free, and the Merchants travel &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>About half a league from the City, toward the North, upon the brow of a high Mountain, &s;tands a little <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> like a Hermitage: and fifteen foot below it gu&s;hes out a fair Spring, which is the be&s;t in the places neer to <HI>Schiras.</HI> Neer to it is a little place encompa&s;t with a Pale, with four Pillars that uphold a Ceeling. Here it is that a <HI>Dervis</HI> &s;its, and entertains all them that come to vi&s;it him, to whom he pre&s;ents Tobacco, according to the cu&s;tom of the Countrey. This place is one of the be&s;t Pro&s;pects in all <HI>Syria,</HI> from whence you behold one way all the plain of <HI>Schiras,</HI> and all the City from one end to the other, with the Gar|dens. But people go not thither for the fair Pro&s;pect, or to vi&s;it the <HI>Dervis,</HI> but to admire a Cypre&s;s-tree not above three or four paces from the Pro&s;pect, planted among the Rocks; and of that bigne&s;s, that four men can hardly fathom it: it is proportionably high, and is look'd upon to be the faire&s;t Cypre&s;s-tree in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where &s;o many grow be&s;ides. This Tree is fed by the Spring which I have mention'd, falling &s;ome eight or ten foot below into a Ci&s;tern, which is always full; whence through a Canal it runs into a Garden in the plain &s;ome &s;even or
<PB N="250" REF="138">
eight hunder'd paces from the Mountain. In this Garden are to be &s;een the re|mains of a Palace of one of the ancient Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> yet what is &s;till to be &s;een, does not declare it to have been very magnificent. The King was call'd <HI>Pad&s;ha quie&s;hel,</HI> the <HI>Scald-pated King.</HI> A thing not to be wonder'd at, in regard there are few <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> but &s;uch as either have or have had &s;cald heads.</P>
<P>Two leagues from <HI>Schiras,</HI> to the South-we&s;t, at the foot of the great Moun|tain, &s;tands a Hermitage, call'd <HI>Pir-Bouno,</HI> where three or four <HI>Dervis</HI> live, as be|ing a plea&s;ant place; for the <HI>Dervis</HI> always choo&s;e out the mo&s;t delightful places to pitch their Tents in: where they &s;it &s;moaking their Pipes with that gravity, that if the King him&s;elf &s;hould come by, they would not &s;tir to give him re|verence. That which adds to the plea&s;ure of that Hermitage, is a fair Spring of water that refre&s;hes the Garden, and the number of fair Trees that are about it.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a league from the City, toward the We&s;t, is to be &s;een a Church-yard encompa&s;t with Walls; in the middle whereof, looking toward <HI>Mecca,</HI> &s;tands a Monument very much frequented by the <HI>Dervis,</HI> and other devout people, who &s;ay their Prayers there, it being the Sepulcher of <HI>Hougia-Hafiz,</HI> for whom they have a very great veneration. The year of his decea&s;e is &s;et down upon his Tomb; being in the year 1381: and he purchas'd that great e&s;teem among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for having compos'd a great Book of Morality, and for that he was al&s;o one of the be&s;t Poets of his time. He has left one great Poem behind him in the prai&s;e of good Wine; which has caus'd many to aver, that <HI>Hougia-Hafiz</HI> was no good <HI>Mu&s;&s;ul-man,</HI> in regard he has &s;o highly prais'd a thing which is &s;o &s;trictly forbidd'n by the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Neer to the Church-yard is a fair Garden, which men go to &s;ee for the beauty of the Cypre&s;s-trees, which are its chief ornament. They are to be admir'd for their height and bigne&s;s, among which, there is one that was planted by the hand of <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> the Great him&s;elf, in the year 1607; and it may well de&s;erve to have been planted by the hand of a Monarch; for it was bigger then the re&s;t that had been planted above a hunder'd years before.</P>
<P>Without the City, upon the North-&s;ide, at the foot of the Mountain, is a Gar|den belonging to the ancient Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> call'd <HI>Bag-Firdous.</HI> It is full of Fruit-trees, and Ro&s;e-trees in abundance. At the end of the Garden, upon the de&s;cent of a Hill, &s;tands a great piece of Building, and below a large Pond af|fords it water. The rich Inhabitants of <HI>Schiras</HI> have been formerly very curious to have fair Gardens, and have been at great expences to that purpo&s;e. But nei|ther at <HI>Schiras,</HI> nor at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is there any thing that may compare with tho&s;e lovely Paradi&s;es of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>There are many Inns in <HI>Schiras,</HI> but the <HI>Franks</HI> generally lodg at the Convent of the <HI>Carmelite</HI> Friars; and they that would be more private, lodg at another Hou&s;e that belongs al&s;o to the &s;ame Friars, which they would fain &s;ell, as being a charge to 'em at this time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A continuation of the Road from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> from <HI>Schi|ras</HI> to <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ixth of <HI>March,</HI> by eight of the Clock in the morning, I departed from <HI>Schiras;</HI> and after &s;ix hours travel through the plain that continues fertil for a league together beyond the City, I came to an Inn call'd <HI>Badaadgi.</HI> The water is bad, being as it were luke-warm. Here cold weather begins to cea&s;e. The next day I &s;et out by break of day, and came to a large and well-built Inn, only it &s;tood remote from any Town. It is call'd <HI>Mouzafferi,</HI> and is the only place in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> where I met with black <HI>Saligots,</HI> or Water-nuts, as big and as good as ours in <HI>Dauphine.</HI> The Countrey breeds nothing but Goats and Sheep: and about two leagues off runs a River along by the Mountain to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The 18<HI>th</HI> I departed by day-break, and travell'd eleven hours through a &s;tone-Countrey, cover'd with bitter Almond and Turpentine-Trees. I lodg'd in a fair Inn, call'd <HI>Paira,</HI> near to a River that comes from the We&s;t, and makes the Coun|trey fertil. There is &s;ome Wood in the Valleys, and &s;ome Villages appear on the other &s;ide of the River toward the South.</P>
<P>The 19<HI>th</HI> I &s;et out by four of the Clock in the morning, and travell'd along a Valley, wherein were many Villages receiving the benefit of the River la&s;t men|tion'd. About eight in the morning I &s;topt at an Inn built in an <HI>Octogonal</HI> form, a good league from the River, with &s;everal Villages between. The name of the Inn is <HI>Kaffer.</HI></P>
<P>The 20<HI>th</HI> I &s;et out two hours after midnight, and travell'd till ten in the morn|ing through a dry Valley. By the way I met &s;everal Shepherds and Herd&s;men, who were for&s;aking the hot Countreys, and driving toward <HI>Schiras</HI> for cool|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>They that travel upon their own Hor&s;es, and would &s;ee one of the riche&s;t parts of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;ome Antiquities, &s;etting out from <HI>Kaffer,</HI> in&s;tead of following the <HI>Caravan</HI>-road, take the right-hand way by the &s;ide of the River, that runs a league and a half from the &s;ame Inn. When you have pa&s;t the River, the way is very &s;treight, and lies for two leagues together through a &s;teep Rock, the Mountain up|on the right, and the River upon the left, where there is not room in &s;ome places for two Hor&s;es to ride a-bre&s;t. All along this way, toward the top of the Moun|tain, are little paths that lead to Caverns, &s;ome of which are &s;o large, that they will contain two or three thou&s;and men. Having pa&s;t this way, you come into a Plain call'd <HI>Dadivan,</HI> four or five leagues in circuit; the greate&s;t part of which is planted with Orange-trees, Citrons, and Granats. Some of the&s;e Orange-trees two men can hardly fathom, being as high as our Walnut-trees; and this is one of the mo&s;t delicious &s;ituations in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I have travell'd through it &s;everal times, and &s;ometimes only to diverti&s;e my &s;elf. The re&s;t of the Plain is &s;ow'd with Rice and Wheat. You &s;et up your Tents under the&s;e Trees, and then the Countrey people bring Provi&s;ion of &s;everal &s;orts, e&s;pecially Partridges, Hares, and wild Goats. The River that cro&s;&s;es the Plain is full of Carps, Barbels, Pikes, and Crey-Fi&s;h. I remember one time a Countrey-man carri'd me down to the water, and before my face took up a Fi&s;h with his hand. He was &s;o nimble at it, that having caught one which he did not think big enough, he threw it back again, and took up another. Now in regard that Travellers generally &s;tay about ten or twelve days in that place, the Tumblers that live there-abouts, fail not to come and give you a Vi&s;it, to &s;hew ye &s;ome of their tricks, and to ta&s;t your <HI>Schiras</HI> Wine. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> u&s;ually &s;pend the end of the Summer in this Plain, for the benefit of the River, and the Trees: which become &s;o large and fair, by means of the River, which the Countrey-men bring in by Canals, and &s;hut it up in Ponds, among the Trees, to water their Grounds; which is all the good this River does in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> for all the re&s;t of its cour&s;e is through cragged Rocks, and &s;alt Mar&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="139">
The 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> by ten in the morning, I came to an Inn which was call'd <HI>Mou&s;hek,</HI> which is a-lone-Hou&s;e at the foot of a Rock. There is a Spring about five hunder'd paces from it, but the water is hot, and has a &s;ulphury ta&s;t; &s;o that the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tel will hardly drink it. Therefore you mu&s;t go to a Ci&s;tern about two Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from the Inn, where there is one newly &s;et up, in&s;tead of another that was there before, into which a Jew once chanc'd to fall in, and was therefore broken by the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>Three quarters of a league from <HI>Mou&s;hetz</HI> are two roads that lead to <HI>Lar,</HI> the one for the Camels, the other for the Hor&s;es and Mules. The fir&s;t is the long|e&s;t by three days journey, and is call'd the Road of the De&s;ert; for after you have pa&s;t a great Town inhabited only by Camel-Ma&s;ters, where you lye the fir&s;t night, between that and <HI>Lar,</HI> you &s;hall meet with nothing of Hou&s;es but only Herd&s;mens Tents, that feed &s;ometimes in one place, &s;ometimes in another. Upon the Camels Road there are another &s;ort of Fowl like the great Partridges in their bodies, but their legs and feet re&s;emble tho&s;e of wild Ducks. The Camels take this Road, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to pa&s;s the Mountain <HI>Jarron,</HI> over which the Hor&s;es and Mules are hardly able to travel.</P>
<P>I &s;et out from <HI>Mou&s;hek</HI> the 21<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> at two in the morning, and having travell'd till eight through a plain, but &s;tony Countrey, I came to the little City of <HI>Jarron,</HI> which is rather to be call'd a Forre&s;t of Palm-trees that bear excellent Dates. I lodg'd in an Inn five hunder'd paces from the City, and &s;taid there two days.</P>
<P>The 24<HI>th,</HI> &s;etting out pre&s;ently after midnight, I travell'd a good hour, and then I began to mount the &s;teep Mountain of <HI>Jarron,</HI> which is very high, and very long; but the de&s;cent is the mo&s;t dangerous that ever I &s;aw in all my Travels; and be&s;ides that, the Moon did not &s;hine. Being at the top, after you have de&s;cended three or four hunder'd paces, you meet with a Bridg of one Arch, that reaches from one Mountain to another; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">old p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ece of Architecture, not enough to be admir'd&punc; being rais'd at the charges of <HI>Iman-Kouli Kan</HI> for the benefit of Travellers. Be|ing come to the bottom of this, you mu&s;t pa&s;s two others as &s;teep in their a&s;cent as in the de&s;cent; upon the top of one of which &s;tands a Ci&s;tern, which, though it be very large, is generally emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by the end of the Summer. Upon the&s;e Mountains there is &s;uch an infinite quantity of Partridg that a man cannot mi&s;s that will but &s;hoot. By eight in the Morning I came to an Inn which is call'd <HI>Shakal,</HI> which is a-lone Hou&s;e in a De&s;ert Countrey, but &s;tor'd with bitter Almond|trees, and Turpentine-trees. Appoaching n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er to the Inn, you meet with two or three Ci&s;terns, which are a great comfort to Travellers, water being very &s;carce upon this Rood. There are at <HI>Shakal</HI> nine or ten <HI>Radars</HI> for the Guard of the Road, who are al&s;o Ma&s;ters of the Inn: So &s;oon as you are alighted, they ask you if you will eat any Kid, being &s;ure of their blow, and having no more to do but to go to the Mountain and fetch one, where they &s;warm. There are &s;tore of Partridges, which are almo&s;t as big as Pullets; of which you may ea&s;ily kill as many as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The 25<HI>th</HI> I travell'd five hours, from morning till noon. An hour after I took Hor&s;e, I met with a Mountain&punc; the de&s;cent whereof was very &s;leep&punc; They call it the Mountain of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hen,</HI> at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oot whereof is a Fountain of encellent water. A good league farther you meet with a fair Inn call'd <HI>Mouezer&eacute;,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a plea&s;ant Grove, where there is an excellent Spring of water; but becau&s;e there is no food to be had, you mu&s;t go as far as <HI>Detad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mb&eacute;,</HI> a Village &s;eated in a plain. A quarter of a league on this &s;ide, upon the top of a Mountain, appears the ruins of an old Ca&s;tle; the Village it &s;elf being &s;urrounded with Palm-trees. The Inn is a good one, provided with a very good Ci&s;tern.</P>
<P>The 25<HI>th</HI> I travell'd through a plain for three hours, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">opt at <HI>Banarou,</HI> a lit|tle City well built at the &s;oot of a high Mountain; upon which appars the re|mains of a large Ca&s;tle. <HI>Benarou</HI> is the Frontier Town of the Province of <HI>Fars,</HI> bordering upon the Province of <HI>Lar.</HI></P>
<P>The 26<HI>th</HI> I departed an hour after midnight, and travell'd till nine in the morn|ing, partly through the Plain, and partly through the Mountains, where I &s;aw an old Tower for the guard of the Road.

built by the Mother of <HI>Aimas, Kan</HI> of <HI>Lar,</HI> when the great <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> took this Countrey from the <HI>Gaures,</HI> whom he con&s;train'd to turn <HI>Mahu|metans.</HI></P>
<P>The 27<HI>th</HI> I &s;et out at four of the Clock in the morning, and about &s;even I pa&s;t through a Village &s;eated in a &s;mall plain. A league from thence I lodg'd in an Inn call'd <HI>Pai-Cotali;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the foot of the Mountain, as being built at the foot of the Mountain. From thence to <HI>Lar</HI> is not above four or five hours tra|velling; but the way is very bad, and &s;everal &s;wift Torrents are to be pa&s;t over.</P>
<P>You may take another Road from <HI>Bihry,</HI> upon the right-hand toward the We&s;t; it is the &s;horter way by two or three leagues: but &s;o bad, and &s;o narrow, that in many places two Hor&s;emen cannot ride a-bre&s;t, being for the mo&s;t part all Rocks and Precipices.</P>
<P><HI>Lar</HI> is the Capital City of the Province of the &s;ame name, which formerly bore the title of a Kingdom. It is but of an ordinary bigne&s;s, enclos'd on both &s;ides with high Mountains, being built round about a Rock, upon which there &s;tands a Ca&s;tle of Free-&s;tone, wherein the King keeps a Garri&s;on. The whole Country is very hot, nor have they any water but Rain water, which they pre|&s;erve in Ci&s;terns, and which &s;ometimes cau&s;es a wide Torrent that runs by one &s;ide of the City, and falls from a Ca&s;cade two &s;tories high, made of Free-&s;tone. In the City and parts adjacent, grow a great number of trees, e&s;pecially Date trees and Tamarisk. The Gardens al&s;o and Mountains are full of Orange trees.</P>
<P>There are but two Inns in <HI>Lar,</HI> the one within the City, which is not a very good one; the other at the end of the City towards <HI>Ormus,</HI> which would be convenient, but that it is always afloat when the Rains fall; for which rea&s;on the <HI>Franks</HI> generally lye at the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Hou&s;e at the end of the City. And there is a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;taying at <HI>Lar,</HI> to change the Camels; for the Camels that come from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> can go no further; every City having their particular priviledges. Which &s;ometimes proves prejudicial to the Merchant, in regard the Governour will delay the change of the Camels till he is pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Fortre&s;s of <HI>Lar</HI> takes up the whole &s;urface of the top of the Rock; and there is but one way to climb it up, with great difficulty. It is more long than broad; and the four corners are fortifi'd with four Ba&s;tions, or Bulwarks, between which are rais'd &s;everal Towers, for the Souldiers Lodgings. That Fortre&s;s is the Royal Pri&s;on, whither the King &s;ends &s;uch Pri&s;oners as he takes in war, or &s;ur|prizes by &s;tratagem. I met with two there, one a Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> the other of <HI>Mengrelia.</HI> The two Princes had each of them a Toman a day allow'd them, and ten or twelve Servants to wait upon them. Upon one of the corners of the Ca&s;tle, toward the We&s;t, was built a Banquetting Hou&s;e with three or four Cham|bers. In the middle of the Court &s;tands the Magazine, full of Bows and Arrows, Bucklers and Muskets, enough to arm fifteen hundred men. For the Inhabitants of the Province, but more e&s;pecially of the City of <HI>Lar,</HI> are accounted the be&s;t Mu&s;queteers in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the be&s;t at making the Barrels of Muskets, all but the Breach, which they know not how to order &s;o well as we. The Governours Hou&s;e an&s;wers to the great Road; but there is nothing at all of neatne&s;s without, only before the door there is a good hand&s;ome Court, about &s;ixty paces &s;quare, and clos'd in with Walls, which leads you into two large Bazars of good Stone, very well arch'd.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants of <HI>Lar</HI> are Jews, who are famous for &s;everal Silk Manufactures, e&s;pecially for making neat Girdles. The Countrymen wear up|on their heads a kind of a felt of fine wool, and very well wrought. It re&s;embles a Cap not yet &s;hap'd, with four Corners behind, and cut on the &s;ides; and the&s;e &s;orts of Caps are made at <HI>Kerman.</HI></P>
<P>There are an infinite number of Ci&s;terns, as well within the City, as in the parts adjacent; and all but little enough, in regard that &s;ometimes it does not rain for three years together. When the Rains fall they do not fill their Ci&s;terns the fir&s;t day, but rather cover them quite up, till the earth be well &s;oak'd. Now for the di&s;tribution of this water they take an excellent cour&s;e; for they never keep open above three Ci&s;terns at a time; and when they do op'n them, the Governour or &s;ome other per&s;on appointed for that purpo&s;e, is pre&s;ent; &s;o precious is water
<PB N="254" REF="140">
in that place, though never &s;o bad. The water thus &s;tanding in the Ci&s;terns &s;ome|times for many years together, breads worms, &s;o that whither you &s;train it, or boil it, there will appear a kind of foulne&s;s in it, which is the &s;eed of the&s;e worms. And this corruption it is that breeds worms in the legs and feet of men; which puts me in mind, that after my return to <HI>Paris,</HI> the fifth time of my travelling, I had one came out of my left foot an Ell an a half long, and another from under the ankle of my right foot half an Ell long.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> I &s;et out from <HI>Lar</HI> by five in the morning, and travell'd till three in the afternoon, through a barren &s;tony Country, except it were only one Village call'd <HI>Tcherkah,</HI> near to which I met with &s;ome Corn-land, and &s;everal Palm-trees. I lodg'd at a little Inn call'd <HI>Shamzenghi.</HI> It is low, built like a Cro&s;s, with four doors to receive the cool winds every way. All the Inns are built in this fa&s;hion between this and <HI>Bander,</HI> and near to one another for the ea&s;e of Travellers. As for the Bea&s;ts, they lye without, for they have no Stables. All the Hou&s;es from <HI>Lar</HI> to <HI>Ormus</HI> are built after one manner. For there is a kind of a Pipe, like a Chimney, that runs from the bottom to the top to gather wind.</P>
<P>The &s;econd I left <HI>Shamzenghi</HI> about four in the afternoon, becau&s;e the heat is cool'd by a gentle breeze toward the evening. Three hours I travell'd through a barren Plain, afterwards over mo&s;t fearful Rocks, and about ten at night I came to <HI>Cormout,</HI> a great Village well &s;tor'd with Palm-trees.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lar</HI> to <HI>Cormout</HI> is the wor&s;t way in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> For many times there is no water to be found.</P>
<P>The third, I parted from <HI>Cormout</HI> a little after midnight; and having travell'd &s;e|ven hours in very bad way, full of great &s;tones and filthy puddles, I came to a new Inn call'd <HI>Tenquidalen.</HI> In the middle of it is a little va&s;e of running water, fed by a little &s;tream that falls from the Mountain. But the water being &s;ome|thing bracki&s;h, they have &s;ince that built a very fair Ci&s;tern. They al&s;o broach'd the Mountain to bring the water into a Plain, which was barren before, but is now fruitful, and beautifi'd with two good Villages. This was done by a rich Merchant, who&s;e Children enjoy the Revenues of both.</P>
<P>The fourth, I &s;et forward an hour after midnight, and travell'd through an un|inhabited Countrey, full of wide Torrents when the rain falls. There are but two &s;mall Inns upon the Road, and about eight in the morning I arriv'd at that which they call <HI>Gourba-Sarghant.</HI> It was built with the Money which a Merchant of <HI>Ormus</HI> left for that purpo&s;e; who&s;e &s;trength fail'd him in that very place, for want of a re&s;ting place. This Inn is not far from a Village that &s;tands upon the Mountain to the North.</P>
<P>The fifth, &s;etting out a little after midnight, I travell'd till &s;even in the morning through a dry and de&s;ert Countrey, yet &s;tor'd with Lentisk trees, and lay at a good Village call'd <HI>Cauore&s;tan,</HI> where the people were mowing large Fields of Barly. Here, if the Inn be full, you may lye at the Countrey-mens Hou&s;es, who are ac|cu&s;tom'd to entertain Travellers, and get well by it. This place is famous for water-Melons, as big as our Pumpkins; and are the be&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The meat is very red, and as &s;weet as Sugar, which is a great refre&s;hment to Travellers. The <HI>Kelonter</HI> of the place gave me two Raddi&s;hes, one weighing 30, the other 45 pounds, and were very good meat.</P>
<P>The 6<HI>th</HI> I &s;et out after midnight, and travell'd till it was day through plains of Sand, over which it is impo&s;&s;ible to find the way without a guide. About three a Clock in the morning I cro&s;s'd over two Bridges joyn'd together by a long Cau&s;ey. Before I came to the fir&s;t, I rode over another for a good quarter of a league, which Cau&s;ey runs on a great way to the &s;econd Bridg, under which flows a &s;alt River; the &s;hoar of which is full of moving &s;ands; &s;o that before tho&s;e Bridges were made, it was dangerous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oard it without a guide.</P>
<P>This Cau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y and the two Bridges were made and built by a <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Aly;</HI> who wanting employment at home, apply'd him&s;elf to the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> who lik'd him &s;o well, that he made him General of his Army. Being thus advanc'd, he al&s;o turn'd Merchant, and trading fir&s;t with one Ve&s;&s;el, then with two, got a great E&s;tate. At length, all that he had thus got in forty years, to get him|&s;elf a name in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he employ'd in making this Cau&s;ey and the two Bridges.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="140">
The&s;e Bridges are both built over a River that comes from toward <HI>Kerman,</HI> and is &s;well'd by other &s;treams that fall from the Mountains with a great noi&s;e and di&s;charges it &s;elf into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, neer to <HI>Bander Congo;</HI> but becomes bracki&s;h by pa&s;&s;ing through Mountains that are nothing but Salt.</P>
<P>From the great Bridg to <HI>Guitchi</HI> is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Countries in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> being a continu'd Grove. <HI>Guitchi</HI> is a place accommodated with two Inns, one a very fair one, and convenient; the other very ill &s;eated, by rea&s;on of the du&s;t that continually annoys it &s;tanding upon a &s;andy ground. It &s;tands neer ten or twelve <HI>Arabian</HI> Tents; &s;o that as &s;oon as you come to the Inn, the <HI>Arabian</HI> Women pre&s;ently bring Milk and Butter, and other refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>A league and a half from <HI>Guitchi</HI> you meet with two Roads, one upon the left-hand that &s;eems more beaten, the other upon the right. There a man may ea&s;ily be deceiv'd that has no guides. For the left-hand way is a dangerous pa&s;|&s;age, and a kind of a continu'd Labyrinth among Rocks and Precipices. The right-hand way, which is the be&s;t, is all upon the &s;and to <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> and is u&s;ually a days journey. You meet with two Inns by the way, the la&s;t of which is call'd <HI>Bend Ali,</HI> built by the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bend-Ali</HI> to <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> is but a little more then two leagues through a Countrey abounding in Palm-trees.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the I&s;land of <HI>Ormus,</HI> and of <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ORmus</HI> is an I&s;land in 92. <HI>d.</HI> 42. <HI>m.</HI> of Longitude, and in 25. <HI>d</HI> 30. <HI>m.</HI> of Lati|tude. It lies at the mouth of the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulph,</HI> two good Leagues from the firm Land. There is neither tree nor herb that grows in it: for it is all over cover'd with Salt, which is very good and as white as &s;now. And as for the black &s;hining Sand-du&s;t of <HI>Ormus,</HI> it is very much us'd for &s;tandi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> came to <HI>Ormus,</HI> there was a City where the Kings of <HI>Ormus,</HI> who where al&s;o Kings of <HI>Larr,</HI> re&s;ided. When the <HI>Portugals</HI> took it there were in it two young Princes, Sons of the decea&s;ed King, whom they carri'd into <HI>Spain.</HI> Where, in regard they were hand&s;omely proportion'd, though &s;ome what &s;warthy, the King entertain'd them very kindly, and gave them an honourable al|lowance. One day that he had &s;hew'd them the <HI>E&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ial,</HI> and all the chief pieces of Architecture in <HI>Madrid,</HI> the King ask'd them what they thought of living in <HI>Spain.</HI> To whom they an&s;wer'd, that they had &s;een nothing but what was worthy admiration, but then fetching a deep &s;igh, and perceiving the King de&s;irous to know the meaning of it, they gave him to under&s;tand that it was for grief that they mu&s;t never more &s;it under their own Tree. For near to the City of <HI>Ormus</HI> was a <HI>Bannians</HI> tree, being the only tree that grew in the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> being ma&s;ters of the I&s;land from an ill-built City, rear'd it to that hight of Magnificence which that Nation admires; &s;o that the very barrs of their doors and windows were all guilt. The Fortre&s;s was a noble thing, and in good repair: and they had al&s;o a &s;tately Church dedicated to the Virgin, where they were al&s;o wont to walk. For other place of promenading they had none. Since the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> took it, the Ca&s;tle indeed &s;tands in good repair, with a Garri&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> it: but the City is gone to ruine; for the Dutch carried mo&s;t of the &s;tones away to build <HI>Battavia.</HI></P>
<P>Between the I&s;land of <HI>Ormus,</HI> and the Continent the Sea is not very deep, for the great &s;hips that &s;ail in and out of the <HI>Gulf,</HI> pa&s;s by the other &s;ide of the I&s;land. As for the Fortre&s;s which &s;tands upon a poynt of the I&s;land, it is almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ncompa&s;s'd with the Sea, and lyes right over again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> &s;o call'd becau&s;e the great <HI>Sha-Abbus</HI> the fir&s;t brought it into re|putation, is at pre&s;ent a City rea&s;onably well built, and &s;tor'd with large w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e|hou&s;es, over which are the lodgings of the Merchants. While the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> kept <HI>Ormus,</HI> though they liv'd in the City, all the trade was at <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> as being the mo&s;t &s;ecure Landing-place upon all the Coa&s;t. About 15 years ago it was an op'n town, but becau&s;e it was an ea&s;ie thing then to get into the Town, and rob
<PB N="256" REF="141">
the Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e in the night, it has bin &s;ince enclos'd with walls. To this place come all the &s;hips that bring Commodities from <HI>India</HI> for <HI>Per&s;ia, Turkie,</HI> or any part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Europe.</HI> And indeed it would be much more frequented by the Merchants from all Regions and Countries.</P>
<P>But the Air of <HI>Bandar</HI> is &s;o unwhole&s;ome and &s;o hot, that no &s;trangers can live there, in probability of health, unle&s;s it be in the months of <HI>December, January, Fe|bruary</HI> and <HI>March;</HI> though the Natives of the Country may perhaps &s;tay without prejudice to the end of <HI>April.</HI> After that they retire to the cooler Mountains, two or three days journey off, for five or &s;ix months, where they eat what they gain'd before. They that venture to &s;tay at <HI>Gomron</HI> during the hot weather, get a malignant Fever, which if they &s;cape death, is hardly ever cur'd. However it bequeaths the yellow Jaundies during life to the party. <HI>March</HI> being pa&s;s'd the wind changes, and blowing at we&s;t &s;outh we&s;t, in a &s;hort time it grows &s;o hot and &s;o &s;tifling, that it almo&s;t takes away a mans breath. This wind is by the <HI>Ara|bians</HI> call'd <HI>El-Samiel,</HI> or the poy&s;onous wind, by the <HI>Per&s;ians Bade&punc;Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">our,</HI> be|cau&s;e it &s;uffocates and kills pre&s;ently. The fle&s;h of them that are thus &s;tifl'd feels like a glewie fat, and as if they had been dead a month before.</P>
<P>In the year 1632. riding from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> I and four more <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Mer|chants had bin &s;tifl'd but for &s;ome-<HI>Arabians</HI> that were in our Company. For when they perceiv'd the wind, they caus'd us to light, lye down upon our bellies and cover our &s;elves with our Cloaks. We lay &s;o for half an hour, and then ri&s;ing we &s;aw our hor&s;es were in &s;uch a &s;weat, that they were hardly able to carry us. This happen'd to us two days journey from <HI>Bagdat.</HI> But this is ob&s;ervable, that if a man be in a Boat upon the water when the &s;ame wind blows, it does no harm though he were naked at the &s;ame time. Sometimes the wind is &s;o hot that it burns like Lightning.</P>
<P>And as the Air of <HI>Gomron</HI> is &s;o bad and dangerous, the &s;oil is worth nothing: For it is nothing but Sand, nor is the water in the Ci&s;terns very good. They that will be at the charge fetch their water from a fountain three leagues from <HI>Bander,</HI> call'd the water of <HI>I&s;&s;in.</HI> Formerly there was not an herb to be &s;een: but by often watering the ground, Lettice, Radi&s;h and Onions have begun to grow.</P>
<P>The People are &s;warthy, and wear nothing about them but only a &s;ingle &s;hirt. Their u&s;ual dyet is dates and fi&s;h. Which is almo&s;t the dyet of their Cattel, for when they come home from brow&s;ing the barren bu&s;hes, they give them the heads and guts of their fi&s;h boyl'd, with the kernels of the Dates which they eat.</P>
<P>The Sea of <HI>Bander</HI> produces good Soles, good Smelts and Pilchards. They that will have oy&s;ters mu&s;t have 'em caught on purpo&s;e, for the people eat none.</P>
<P>Upon Land they want neither for wine of <HI>Schiras</HI> nor <HI>Ye&s;d;</HI> nor for Mutton, Pi|geons and Partridge, which are their ordinary dyet.</P>
<P>There are two Fortre&s;&s;es, one upon the Ea&s;t, the other toward the We&s;t. The Town increa&s;es in trade and building, and fills with inhabitants, who build their hou&s;es with the remaining ruins of <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the Trade is &s;ettl'd rather at <HI>Bander Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> then at <HI>Bander Con|go,</HI> where the Air is good and the Water excellent, is becau&s;e that between <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Congo</HI> lie &s;everal I&s;lands, which make the pa&s;&s;age for &s;hips dangerous, be&s;ides that the often change and veering of the wind is requir'd: neither indeed is there water enough for a Ve&s;&s;el of 20 or 25 guns. Then the way from <HI>Congo</HI> to <HI>Lar</HI> is very bad. From <HI>Bander Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> to <HI>Lar</HI> it is very good, and provided with good Inns.</P>
<P>From the day that a Merchant takes up mony at <HI>Gomron,</HI> he is bound to return it in three months, and the change goes from &s;ix to twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI> When the Goods come to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> or any other place, the Merchant is not to touch them, till &s;he has pay'd the money which he borrow'd, unle&s;s the Creditor will tru&s;t him farther. Some <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants take up money at <HI>Gomron</HI> to pay it at <HI>Suratt;</HI> where they take up other money for <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> for <HI>Erzerom</HI> or <HI>Bagdat,</HI> paying the old debt with the new &s;ums&punc; which they take up in each place. The money taken up at <HI>Erzerom</HI> is pai'd at <HI>Bur&s;a, Con&s;tantinople</HI> or <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Money taken up at <HI>Bagdat</HI> is pai'd at <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>I always made accompt, that to take up money at <HI>Golconda</HI> for <HI>Ligorn</HI> or <HI>Venice,</HI> at change for change, the money returns at the cheape&s;t rate, to 95 <HI>per Cent.</HI> but more oftentimes it amounts to a hunder'd.</P>

<P>All this while the Men ride upon Hor&s;es, and the goods are carri'd by Ca|mels.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Candahar</HI> is the chief of one of the Conquer'd Provinces of <HI>Per&s;ia&punc;</HI> having been often the occa&s;ion of war between the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI> At length <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> became Ma&s;ter of it, the Prince that then raign'd there, choo&s;ing to put him&s;elf under the Protection of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> rather then of great <HI>Mogull:</HI> but upon this condition, that the Governour &s;hould be always one of his race. And therefore <HI>Alimerdan-Kan</HI> was the Son of the la&s;t Prince of <HI>Candahar.</HI> That Prince left behind him &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t Trea&s;ury, that his Plate
<PB N="258" REF="143">
was all of Gold, and he had &s;o much Gold in his Coffers, that when he went to the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> he would not accept of any thing for his maintenance, but contented him&s;elf with one of the highe&s;t Dignities in the Empire, which he enjoy'd till his death. At <HI>Jehanabad</HI> he built a mo&s;t neat Hou&s;e, with a fair Garden upon the River.</P>
<P>He got his wealth in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for the greate&s;t part came by Inhe|ritance, by the great advantages which he made of the <HI>Caravans</HI> that then pa&s;s'd oft'ner through <HI>Candahar</HI> then they do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w adays. For by delaying the Mer|chants at the Cu&s;tome-Hou&s;e, and by treating them him&s;elf, and receiving treat|ments from them again, he caus'd them to &s;pend their Provi&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; which they were forc'd to recruit again at <HI>Candahar.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> left the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Candahar</HI> to <HI>Sha-Sefi</HI> his Grand-child. In who&s;e time <HI>Alimerdan-Kan</HI> deliver'd it up to the Grand <HI>Mogal. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a Abbas</HI> the Second retook it in the year 1650. Where|upon <HI>Sha-gehan</HI> &s;ent his elde&s;t Son to drive him out. But though his Army con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred thou&s;and men, yet the place &punc;was &s;o well defend|ed that he lo&s;t the be&s;t part of his Army before it. The next year <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> &s;ent another Army under the Command of <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> but he had no better &s;ucce&s;s then his Brother. Thereupon <HI>Begum Saheb, Sha-jehan's</HI> el|de&s;t Daughter, and pa&s;&s;ionately belov'd by him even to Ince&s;t, bearing the greate&s;t &s;way in the Kingdom, and having a Va&s;t Trea&s;ure, rais'd an Army at her own charges, and made <HI>Aurergzeb</HI> Commander of it. After many a&s;|&s;aults, <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing with his Generals one day who &s;hould have the honour if he took the City, and being told that his Si&s;ter would have the honour in regard &s;he had rais'd the Army, the Prince either jealous of his Si&s;ter, or el&s;e&punc; not loath to give occa&s;ion of being envy'd by his Brothers, a&s;&s;ault|ed it no more, and when the rains came, rais'd his &s;iege.</P>

<P>Thus I have fini&s;h'd the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ob&s;ervations as well in reference to <HI>Turkie</HI> as to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I have been curious to under&s;tand things&punc; and have lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kt wich a &s;trict eye upon them: and I am oblig'd to inform the Reader, that he mu&s;t not travel into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in expectation of mending his experience in any of the nobler Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Gold&s;miths work, or Turning. As for the Coverlets, Embroideries, Ti&s;&s;ues of Gold and Silver, which are made in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and which we admir'd formerly in <HI>France,</HI> all the&s;e give place to our new manufactures. In&s;omuch that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves admire the rich goods of <HI>Europe,</HI> and when we carry any thither, they are in mediately bought up by the King and the Nobility. They neither under&s;tand any thing of Architecture: nor is there any thing in all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> that equalls the Riches and Beauty of the <HI>Loure,</HI> or of any other of the Kings hou&s;es in <HI>France,</HI> which infinitely excell in workman&s;hip all the magnificence of the Ea&s;tern Monarchs. Which has made me with a&s;toni&s;hment admire that &s;o many Travellers have a&s;crib'd to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and other Regions of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> tho&s;e beauties for which they were never beholding either to Art or Nature. For if all they have &s;aid had been true, tho&s;e won|ders could never have e&s;caped my &s;ight; and I dare a&s;&s;ure the Reader that I have de&s;crib'd the naked truth of things as really they are.</P>

<HEAD>The Money of <HI>Arabia.</HI>
<HI>Larin,</HI> Figure 1. <HI>Half-Larin&punc;</HI> Fig. 2.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>The Author not ha|ving given an account of the weight or finene&s;s of the Coins he treats of, but having only ex|pre&s;s'd their value in <HI>French</HI> Livres, it is thought fit for the bet|ter reduction thereof into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coin, to ad|verti&s;e, That Three <HI>French</HI> Livres make a <HI>French</HI> Crown, which pa&s;&s;es in Exchange from 54 pence to 58 pence half-penny; &s;o that a <HI>French</HI> Livre may be in value as the Ex|change goes, from 18 pence to 19 pence half-penny. And twenty Sous make a Livre.</P></HEADNOTE>
<P>_THIS Money <HI>(Fig.</HI> 1.) is call'd Larin, and &s;ignifies the &s;ame with our Crowns. The Five Pieces are as much in value as one of our Crowns; and the Ten Half-Larins as much. Only the Five Larins want in weight Eight Sous of our Crown. This is that which the <HI>Emirs,</HI> or Princes of <HI>Arabia</HI> take for the Coining of their Money; and the profit which they make by the Merchants that travel through the De&s;art, either into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> or the <HI>Indies.</HI> For then the <HI>Emirs</HI> come to the <HI>Caravans,</HI> to take their Tolls, and to change their Crowns, Reals, or Ducats of Gold, for the&s;e Larins. For they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity pa&s;s that way. And they mu&s;t u&s;e very &s;mooth words to boot; for there is nothing to be got by rough Languages. If they &s;ee the Merchants will not change their Money, then will they refu&s;e to take their Toll; but making as if they had not time to ca&s;t up the accompt, they go a hunting, and leave the Merchants fifteen or twenty Days without &s;aying any thing more to them; while they in the mean time &s;pend their Provi&s;ions, not knowing where to get more. If the <HI>Caravan</HI> goes on without paying their Tolls, the&s;e <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes will either cut them in Pieces, or take away their Camels, or rob them of all they have, as they have &s;everal times done. In one Journey that I made, one of the&s;e Princes kept us one and twenty days; after which we thought our &s;elves happy to be quit of him, when we had given him whatever he demanded. If the&s;e five Larins did but weigh as much as the Crown, or Real of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Merchants would never be much troubled. But when they come to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or the <HI>Indies,</HI> they mu&s;t carry their Money to the Mint, as I have &s;aid in another place, and lo&s;e above eight Sous in a Crown, which amounts to 14 <HI>per Cent.</HI> As for what remains, the Larins are one of the ancient Coins
<PB N="2" REF="150">
of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and though at this day they are onely currant in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and at <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> neverthele&s;s, from <HI>Bragdatt</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> they traffick altogether with the Larin, and all along the <HI>Per&s;ian Gold;</HI> where they take 80 Larins for one <HI>Toman,</HI> which is 50 <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Money currant under the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the Gold and Silver which is brought into the Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> is refined to the highe&s;t perfection before it be coined into Money.</P>
<P>The Roupy of Gold weighs 2 Drams and a half, and 11 Grains, and is valued in the Country at 14 Roupies of Silver. We reckon the Roupy of Silver at 30 Sous. So that a Roupy of Gold comes to 21 Livres of <HI>France;</HI> and an Ounce of Gold to 58 Livres, and 4 Deneer's. This Gold is like that which we buy at 54 Livres an Ounce. And if you bring this Gold in Ingots, or Du|cats of <HI>European</HI> Gold, you &s;hall have always 7 and a half profit; if you can &s;cape paying any thing to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es. The Half-Roupy comes to 10 Livres 10 Sous; and the Quarter-Roupy to 5 Livres 5 Sous. As I have &s;aid, you mu&s;t reckon the Silver Roupy at 30 Sous, though it weigh not above 3 Drams; whereas our pieces of 30 Sous weigh 3 Drams, and half 4 grains; but the Roupy is much the better Silver. In a word, they that under&s;tand Traffick well, and carry hence Gold or Silver to the Territories of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> get always 7 or 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> profit, provided they take care to &s;hun the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es. For if you pay them, the 7 or 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which you might make pro|fit, goes to them; and &s;o the Roupy comes to 30 Sous, the Half to 15, and the Quarter to 7 and a half, the eighth Part to 3 Sous and 9 Deneers.</P>
<P>As for their Copper Money, &s;ometimes 'tis worth more, &s;ometimes le&s;s, as Cop|per comes to the Mint. But generally the bigge&s;t &s;ort is worth 2 Sous of our Mo|ney, the next 1 Sous, the next to that 6 Deneers.</P>
<P>As for their Shell Money, the nearer you go to the Sea, the more you give for a Pecha, for they bring them from <HI>Mnldi8es.</HI> Fifty or &s;ixty of the&s;e make a whcih is that piece of Coin that is worthbut 6 Deneers.</P>
<P>For their Money of Mamoudi's, half Mamoudi's, and Almonds, all that &s;ort of Money is only currant in the Province of <HI>Guzeratt,</HI> the principal Cities whereof are <HI>Surat, Barocha, Cambaya, Broudra</HI> and <HI>Amadabat.</HI> Five Mamoudi's go for a Crown, or a Real. For &s;mall Money they make no u&s;e of the&s;e Shells, but of little Almonds, which are brought from about <HI>Ormus,</HI> and grow in the De&s;arts of the Kingdom of <HI>Larr.</HI> If you break one of the Shells, it is impo&s;&s;ible to eat the Almond, for there is no <HI>Coloquintida</HI> &s;o bitter; &s;o that there is no fear le&s;t the Children &s;hould eat their &s;mall Money. They have al&s;o tho&s;e little pieces of Copper which are call'd Pecha, 6 Deneer's in value. They give 20 for a Mamoudi, and 40 Almonds for a Pecha; &s;ometimes you may have 44, according to the quantity which is brought. For &s;ome years the Trees do not bear, and then the price of this &s;ort of Money is very much rai&s;ed in that Country; and the Bankers know how to make their be|nefit.</P>

When you are at <HI>Agra,</HI> the Territories of this King lye to the North; and before you can come at them, you mu&s;t pa&s;s over very high and cragged Mountains. 'Tis a good Country, where are all things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of humane life, except Rice, which is a great inconvenience to the In|habitants, who being all Idolaters, are depriv'd thereby of their chiefe&s;t delica|cies, in regard they feed upon nothing &s;o heartily as upon Rice. They have excel|lent Corn and Grapes, but they make no Wine, though they make &s;ome <HI>Aqua vitae.</HI> They want neither Oxen nor Cows; but their Hor&s;es are little, weak and ill|&s;hap'd. All the Trade which the&s;e people have with their Neighbours, is in Cop|per, whereof they have two extraordinary Mines, from whence they furni&s;h the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Territori&eacute;s; out of which they have Salt in exchange, not having any of their own. This Salt co&s;ts them dear, in regard it is four months travel to the place where they fetch it, that is to &s;ay, from the Territories of <HI>Maton-cha</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Coa&s;t towards <HI>Bacaim.</HI> They travel upon Oxen, and the &s;ame Oxen carry their Copper.

<HEAD>Pieces of Gold called Pagods, which are currant in the Territories of the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> the&punc; King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the&punc; Great <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velouche,</HI> and at the Diamond Mines.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Pieces of Gold repre&s;ented in the Plate of <HI>Golconda</HI>-Money, pa&s;s through all the&s;e Countries at the &s;ame value, and are about the weight of our half Pi&s;tol; but the Gold is of a ba&s;er Mettal, &s;o that an Ounce is not worth above 42 or 43 Livres; not going for more than four Roupies.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 1. Is one of the ancient Pagods, at the time when the <HI>Raja</HI>'s were Ma|&s;ters of the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and they are only &s;tampt upon one &s;ide as you &s;ee. They are as heavy as the new ones; and though they be no better Gold, yet &s;ome years &s;ince they went at 20, and 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than the new ones; the rea&s;on is, for that the Bankers being all Idolaters, they are &s;o &s;uper|&s;titious as to believe, that if they melt down that Money, &s;ome Calamity will be|fall their Country; and they hold this for &s;uch a certain truth, That for fear the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> &s;hould melt it, they paid him for certain Years 20000 Pagods. But you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the&s;e old Pagods are no-where currant but in the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda.</HI> For my part, I think it is more for their profit than out of any Super&s;tition, that they make u&s;e of them in that manner. For in all the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> in matter of trade, they never mention any but the old Pagods, though they make their payments in new Pagods, or Roupies; and in this ca&s;e they who receive tho&s;e new Pagods, or tho&s;e Roupies, play their game &s;o well, that they gain a fourth part, or a half, and &s;ometimes one <HI>per Cent.</HI> al|ledging for the rea&s;on, that tho&s;e new Pagods are either the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI>'s, or the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Carnatica</HI>'s, or the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velouche</HI>'s, or the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> And they make as much of the Roupies; for there is no con&s;idera|ble payment made, which is not received by the <HI>Cheraff</HI> or Banker, making it good to the Seller, who &s;ometimes has no need of his Money in a Month or two, and &s;o he receives the intere&s;t of it, though it be but for two days. If the payment be made in old Pagods, and that the &s;um amount to two or three hundred, or three or four thou&s;and, the Banker takes them all, and viewing them one after another, he divides them into five or &s;ix parts; and then poi&s;ing them all, he &s;ayes of &s;ome, that they are more us'd than others, and that having pa&s;&s;ed through many hands, there is a wa&s;te of the mettal about one <HI>per Cent.</HI> O|thers, &s;ayes he, want not above half one <HI>per Cent.</HI> others but a fourth part. The&s;e Pagods have been bor'd &s;ome half thorough, others a quarter thorough; and it is a wonderful thing what this boring amounts to. For in regard the&s;e Pagods are very thick, and cannot be clipt, tho&s;e that are Ma&s;ters of the trade, take a Piercer, and pierce the Pagod thorough the &s;ide, half way or more, taking out of one piece as much Gold as comes to two or three Sous. And provided they be not taken in the fact, they chu&s;e rather to follow this Trade than any other; there be|ing no handycraft Tradesmen among the <HI>Indians,</HI> that gain more than three Sous a day. After they have drawn out the piercer, they knock upon the holes with a little Hammer, and are &s;o cunning in clo&s;ing up the holes again, that he mu&s;t be very skilful indeed, that can di&s;cover the cheat. For this rea&s;on, they never receive any payment till they have &s;hew'n the Pieces to the <HI>Cheraff</HI> or Banker; and though he looks only on two or&punc; three Pieces, he takes a Sous. They have al&s;o another cunning Trick, and the more the Banker is in credit,

the more he gains; for if he makes any payment, according to the quantity of the &s;um, he puts the Pagods by fifty or a hundred together in little bags, and &s;eals them up with his Seal, and writes upon the bag the number of the Pagods with|in; and &s;o delivers them to him to whom he makes the payment. When the Party makes u&s;e of them, he never opens the bag, but gives them as they are, to him to whom they are due; who goes to the &s;ame Banker that &s;eal'd the bags. The Banker &s;eeing his Seal whole, makes an&s;wer, That the Pieces are good, and in that manner they &s;hall pa&s;s all the Year without opening the bags. But when ever they change the hand, they &s;end for the &s;ame Banker, who always will have &s;o much <HI>per Cent.</HI> for his Vi&s;it. But, as I have &s;aid, the Merchant leaves them in his hand to get Intere&s;t; who then pays Eight <HI>per Cent.</HI> for a Year, and &s;ome|times Twelve. Thus the Bankers have always the greate&s;t part of the Mo|ney in the Kingdom in their hands, of which they make large profit. 'Tis the Cu&s;tom in that Country, every Month to pay the Soldiery; but for the mo&s;t part, the Soldiers, Captains, and other Officers will not &s;tay till the Month be up, but come to the Bankers, who di&s;count after the rate of Eighteen or Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> by the Year, be&s;ides that they pay them in the&s;e Pagods, again&s;t which others would often object. If there be any large Diamond to be &s;old in any Country, the&s;e Bankers have intelligence of it pre&s;ently; or if there be any fair Ruby, 'tis not long before they have it in pawn; for every Year when the Mer|chants return from <HI>Pegu,</HI> and have any Rubies, mo&s;t commonly they are in debt; and in regard it is the Cu&s;tom to pay within fifteen dayes after the Mer|chant comes a&s;hoar, he pawns his be&s;t goods he has for payment, as well of the freight of the Ship, as of what he may have taken up at <HI>Pegu.</HI> After that he &s;ells the wor&s;t of his goods to pay the Banker, who lent him the Money upon his arrival.

The other Name, by which &s;he was call'd at Court, was <HI>Nour-mahall,</HI> which &s;ignifies the <HI>Light of the Seraglio.</HI> She was always a great enemy to the King's two Sons; more e&s;pe|cially to the &s;econd, who was called <HI>Sultan Kourom:</HI> and who afterwards come|ing to the Throne, called him&s;elf <HI>Cha-gehan.</HI> He &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e all the de&s;igns of this Prince&s;s: who, for her part, had &s;uch an A&s;cendant over the King, that &s;he per&s;waded him to &s;pend the greate&s;t part of the year in the Country, un|der-hand &s;oliciting certain <HI>Raja</HI>'s upon the Frontiers to ri&s;e again&s;t him, that &s;he might engage him in the Wars, and keep him from the company of his Sons. This Queen, being altogether Ambitious, made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to plea&s;e the King, that &s;he might the more ea&s;ily accompli&s;h her de&s;igns; and having a great de&s;ire to eternize her Memory, &s;he could not think of a better way, than to Coin a good quantity of Money in her own Name: and of a different &s;tamp from that which the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings were wont to Coin. For you mu&s;t take notice, that all the Coins of tho&s;e Kings have only the Characters of the Countrey upon each &s;ide of the Piece. But this Queen caus'd one of the twelve Signs to be &s;tamp'd upon each &s;ide of Hers, which is contrary to the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that forbids all man|ner of repre&s;entations. However, &s;he had never brought her de&s;ign about, had <HI>Sultan Kourom</HI> been at Court. But &s;he took her time, when the King had caus'd the eyes of his elde&s;t Son, <HI>Sultan Ko&s;rou</HI> to be put out, becau&s;e he had taken up Arms again&s;t him, with an intention to depo&s;e him from his Throne. For after he had obtain'd that Victory, he &s;ent his &s;econd Son, <HI>Sultan Kourom,</HI> into <HI>Decan,</HI>

with a powerful Army again&s;t the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> who was in Rebellion. Queen <HI>Nourmahall</HI> &s;eeing her &s;elf deliver'd from tho&s;e that were able to cro&s;s her de|&s;igns, and particularly from <HI>Sultan Kourom,</HI> the mo&s;t Potent, and the mo&s;t inve|terate of all her enemies, and believing it &s;ea&s;onable to di&s;cover her purpo&s;e to the King, &s;et her &s;elf to flatter him more than &s;he was wont; inventing new ways to divertize him, &s;ometimes with Hunting, and &s;ometimes in the <HI>Haram,</HI> with Balls and Comedies: One day that the King was extremely well-pleas'd, and having drank briskly, began to be very merry; after the Queen had Danc'd in his pre&s;ence, he took her, and &s;et her by him, prote&s;ting to her, that he lov'd her above all the Prince&s;&s;es in his Court; and that but for her, he had dy'd for grief, to &s;ee that his Son <HI>Sultan Ko&s;rou</HI> &s;hould be &s;o traiterou&s;ly bold, as to endeavour to deprive him of his Scepter. The Queen &s;eeing the King &s;o highly affected toward her, fail'd not to make u&s;e of &s;o favourable an opportunity. To which purpo&s;e, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, if it be true that your Maje&s;ty has that kindne&s;s for me, of which you would per&s;wade me to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, I know you will grant me one favour which I have pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ir'd a long time; that I may only Reign as Sovereign the &s;pace of twenty four hours. This reque&s;t &s;urpriz'd the King, and kept him very &s;ad for &s;ome days, being unwilling to deny her any thing, and yet being as loth to grant her a Boon of &s;o high a nature. In the mean time the Queen ply'd the King with pa&s;time and Diverti&s;ements, pretending to take no notice of his melancholy. At length the fifth day after &s;he had made her Petition, the King no longer able to re&s;i&s;t her Charms, nor the 
&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion he had for her, told her he would retire for twenty four hours, and that &s;he might a&s;&s;ume the ab&s;olute Command of the Kingdom during that time. At the &s;ame time he caus'd all the Grandees that were then at Court, to be &s;ent for into his pre&s;ence, and then commanded them to obey her, and punctually to execute her Orders, as if it were he him&s;elf that &s;poke to them. It was a long time before that the Queen had made every thing ready, and that &s;he had &s;ecretly hoarded up great quantities of Gold and Silver in all the Cities where the Mints were appointed, and had di&s;tributed the Stamps as &s;he thought convenient. And indeed it was a wonderful thing, that a Woman &s;hould &s;o politickly carry on &s;o great a de&s;ign, as to have four and twenty Stamps engrav'd, and to keep in a readine&s;s in Gold and Silver above two Millions in all the Cities, without being di&s;covered to the King, or any of the Court. There were none but the Mint-Ma&s;ters that knew any thing of her de&s;ign, whom &s;he engag'd by large promi&s;es, and larger hopes; as believing that &s;he could certainly obtain her de&s;ire one day of the King; and then, if &s;he had her Materials ready, that &s;he could do her bu&s;ine&s;s in twenty four hours. The day being appointed, &s;he &s;ent away Me&s;&s;engers to all the Cities, commanding them on that day to Coin <HI>Roupies</HI> of Gold and Silver, to the value already mention'd. When the King and the Grandees came to under&s;tand the bu&s;ine&s;s, they were &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd; e&s;pecially <HI>Sultan Kourom,</HI> the Queens implacable enemy, who, as &s;ome per&s;ons of the Countrey a&s;&s;ur'd me, fainted away at the news, and did not come to him&s;elf in a good while after. The thing was &s;o &s;uddenly done, e&s;pecially in the Cities neer at hand, that within two hours after &s;he was &s;ate up|on the Throne, &s;he caus'd &s;everal quantities of that Gold and Silver to be thrown among the people, which during the Reign of <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> went currantly for <HI>Rou|pies.</HI> But when <HI>Sultan Kourom,</HI> who took upon him the Name of <HI>Cha-gehan</HI> came to the Crown after the death of his Father, he forbad all per&s;ons to u&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Roupies</HI> upon pain of death, and commanded all that had any of them, either in Gold or Silver, to carry them to the Mint; where they &s;hould receive the value of them, to the end they might be melted down. For which rea&s;on they are at pre&s;ent very rare, particularly tho&s;e in Gold; among the re&s;t, two or three of them are &s;o hard to be found, that an hundred Crowns has been given for one of them. The <HI>Roupies</HI> of Gold are worth one and twenty <HI>Livres</HI> of our Money: and tho&s;e of Silver, thirty <HI>Sous.</HI> The Queen, during her Reign of twenty four hours, had that re&s;pect for the King, that on the back-&s;ide of the Pieces whereon the twelve Signs were Engraven, &s;he caus'd the Name of <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> to be &s;tamp'd with her own, and the name of the place where they were Coin'd, all in <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters.</P>

of the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;cended: and therefore for his &s;atisfaction, I will tell him in a few words. Her Father, a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> by Nation, a man naturally Ambitious, and who in his own Country was no more than a bare Captain of Hor&s;e, without any hopes of ri&s;ing to any higher preferment, travell'd into the <HI>Indies,</HI> to &s;erve the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> who was then <HI>Gehan-guir,</HI> with an intention of rai&s;ing his For|tune in a &s;trange Country. <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> had then many Enemies, the Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> being in Rebellion again&s;t him, and &s;everal <HI>Raja's</HI> having taken their part. So &s;oon as he came to ki&s;s the Kings Hands, the King took a liking to him, and gave him immediately the Command of the five hundred Hor&s;e. And becau&s;e he was very well skill'd in A&s;trology, (which is a Science to which the <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> are very much addicted) the King e&s;teem'd him the more, and in a &s;hort time made him General of his Army. But afterwards, forgetting his duty, and the benefits he had received, he joyn'd with <HI>Sultan Ko&s;rou, Gehan-guir</HI>'s elde&s;t Son; and having gain'd a great part of the Army, they con&s;pir'd together to depo&s;e the King, and &s;et up his Son in his &s;tead. There was at that time in the Court, an <HI>Eunuch</HI> of great wit, who did more mi&s;chief to the Army in his Clo&s;et, than he could have done in the Field. This <HI>Eunuch,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as intelligence was brought of the Rebellion, told the King, that if his Maje&s;ty pleas'd, he would deliver <HI>Ko&s;rou</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ge|neral into his hands in a &s;hort time, without &s;o much as &s;triking one &s;troke, or lo&s;ing one man. He was as good as his word in part, for he &s;o order'd his bu&s;ine&s;s, by his politick contrivances, that the General was brought to the King, who would not pre&s;ently put him to death. <HI>Sultan Ko&s;rou</HI> e&s;cap'd that bout, and continu'd the War many years again&s;t his Father, who at length took him in Fight, and caus'd his eyes to be pull'd out. The King detaining the General in cu&s;tody, his Wife and his Daughter found a way to &s;ave his life, as you &s;hall hear. The Daughter of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> General, who was his only Child, was about fourteen years of Age, the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Beauty at that time in all the Kingdom; &s;he was mo&s;t rarely educated, and could both write and read the <HI>Arabian, Per&s;ian,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Languages. The Mother and the Daughter went every day to Court, to hear what would become of the General; and under&s;tanding at length, that the King intended either to put him to death, or to ban &s;h him, they came to the <HI>Haram,</HI> and ca&s;ting them&s;elves at his Maje&s;ties feet, they humbly begg'd pardon, the one for her Husband, the other for her Father; which they ea&s;ily obtain'd; the King being &s;urpriz'd at the Beauty of the Virgin, to whom he afterwards &s;urrendred his Affections. All the Court was a&s;toni&s;h'd afterwards, how the General and his Wife could keep, &s;o private, a Daughter that was &s;o incomparably fair, that it &s;hould not come to the Kings knowledge. At length he lov'd her &s;o tenderly, that not being able to deny her the liberty of Reigning one whole day in his place, he gave her leave to &s;hare with him afterwards in the Government. And &s;he it was, that gave motion to all the mo&s;t important Affairs of State; the King excu&s;ing him&s;elf to the Grandee's of his Court, who wonder'd why he let the Queen bear &s;o great a &s;way, by telling them that &s;he was fit for the Government, and that it was time for him to take his ea&s;e.</P>

But for the Money of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> there is great lo&s;s in tran&s;porting it any where el&s;e; becau&s;e the Prince enhances it to &s;o high a value. The pieces as well of Gold as Silver are very good Metal; for the Gold in worth is &s;omewhat higher than our <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 1 and 2. This piece of Gold weighs 14 Grains; and to take the Gold at 48 Grains the ounce, would amount to 20 Sous, one Deneer, and one half-peny of our Money. But going in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> for 24 Sous, there would be nineteen and an half lo&s;s to tran&s;port it any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 3 and 4. Is a piece of Silver that weighs eight Grains; and to take an Ounce of Silver at three Livres ten Sous, it comes to a Sous of our Money. But in the Country you have but fifty of the&s;e pieces, or at mo&s;t &s;ometimes fifty two for one of our Crowns, or a Real of <HI>Spain,</HI> or an <HI>High-German</HI> Rixdollar.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 5 and 6.

The piece weighs 25 Grains, which comes to three of our Sous, one Deneer, and one half-peny.</P>
<P>This is all that I could collect of mo&s;t certainty, concerning the Money and Coins of the Ea&s;t, during the long cour&s;e of my Travels. Nor do I believe that any per&s;on has undertaken, before me, to write upon the &s;ame Subject.

But neither the one nor the other touch at <HI>Ma&s;cate,</HI> to avoid paying Cu&s;toms to an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, who took that place from the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;cate</HI> is a City &s;ituate ju&s;t by the Sea-&s;ide, over again&s;t three Rocks that make the Entry into the Harbour very difficult, and at the foot of a Mountain upon which the <HI>Portugals</HI> have three or four Forts. It is ob&s;erved that <HI>Ma&s;cate, Ormus,</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> are the three places in the Ea&s;t where the heat is mo&s;t in|&s;upportable. Formerly only the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under&s;tood this Cour&s;e of Navigation; but &s;ome years after the <HI>Armenians, Mahometans, Indians,</HI> and <HI>Banians,</HI> have built them Ve&s;&s;els. But it is not &s;o &s;afe to Embark in them, for they neither under&s;tand the Sea &s;o well, nor are they &s;o good Pilots.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;els that Sail to <HI>Suratt,</HI> which is the only Part in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> Sail within &s;ight of <HI>Diu,</HI> and the <HI>Point</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> and come to an Anchor afterwards in the Road of <HI>Couali,</HI> which is not above four Leagues from <HI>Suratt,</HI> and two from the Mouth of the River toward the North. They tran&s;port their Wares from one place to another, either by Waggons, or in Boats. For great Ve&s;&s;els cannot get into the River of <HI>Suratt</HI> till they have unladen, by rea&s;on of the Sands that choak it up. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> return as &s;oon as they have landed their Wares at <HI>Couali,</HI> and &s;o do the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it not being permitted to ei|ther to enter into the River. But &s;ome years &s;ince, the King has given the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a place to Winter in, during the rainy Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Suratt</HI> is a City of an indifferent bigne&s;s, defended by a pitiful Fortre&s;s, by the foot whereof you mu&s;t pa&s;s, whether you go by Land or by Water. It has four Towers at the four Corners, and in regard there are no Platforms upon the Walls, Guns are planted upon wooden Scaffolds. The Governor of the Fort only com|mands the Soldiers in the Fort, but has no power in the City, which has a par|ticular Governour to receive the King's Cu&s;toms, and other Revenues through the Extent of his Province.</P>
<P>The Walls of the Town are only of Earth, and the generality of the Hou&s;es like Barns, being built of Reeds, plai&s;tered with Cow-dung, to cover the void &s;paces, and to hinder them without from di&s;cerning bet<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="4 letters"> the Reeds what is done within. In all <HI>Suratt</HI> there be but nine or ten Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">hich are well built: whereof the <HI>Cha-bander,</HI> or chief of the Merchants, has two or three. The re&s;t belong to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Merchants; nor are tho&s;e, wherein the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> dwell, le&s;s beautiful; every Pre&s;ident, and every Commander, be|ing careful to repair them; which they put upon the account of their Compa|nies. However, they do but hire tho&s;e Hou&s;es; the King not &s;uffering any <HI>Frank</HI> to have an Hou&s;e of his own, for fear he &s;hould make a Fortre&s;s of it. The <HI>Ca|puchin</HI> Friars have built them a very convenient Convent, according to the Model of our <HI>European</HI> Hou&s;es, and a fair Church; for the building of which, I furni&s;h'd them with good part of the Money. But the Purcha&s;e was made in the Name of a <HI>Maronite</HI> Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Chelebi,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken in my <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Relations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Cu&s;toms, Money, Exchange, Weights and Mea&s;ures of the <HI>INDIANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO avoid Repetitions, which cannot be &s;hunn'd in the Cour&s;e of long Travels; it behoves me to let the Reader under&s;tand what belongs to the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, Money, Exchange, Weights and Mea&s;ures of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>When your Commodities are unladen at <HI>Suratt,</HI> you mu&s;t carry them to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e adjoyning to the Fort. They are very &s;evere, and very exact in &s;earching the People. Particular Merchants pay from four to five <HI>per Cent.</HI> at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for all &s;orts of Ware. But for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, they pay le&s;s: But I believe if they did but ca&s;t up what it co&s;ts them in Depu|tations and Pre&s;ents which they are oblig'd every year to &s;end to the Court, they would not pay much le&s;s for their Wares, then particular Merchants.</P>
<P>Gold and Silver pay two in the hundred, and when it is brought into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, the Ma&s;ter of the Mint comes and takes it, and Coins it into the Money of the Countrey. They agree with him upon the day wherein he will un|dertake to return the new Pieces: And for &s;o many days as he makes them &s;tay after that, he pays them Intere&s;t, according to the proportion of the Silver which he receives. The <HI>Indians</HI> are very &s;ubtil and crafty in matters of Money and Payments; three or four years after the Silver is coin'd, it lo&s;es half <HI>per Cent.</HI> and goes at the &s;ame rate as old Silver; for, &s;ay they, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that it &s;hould lo&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o many hands. You may carry all &s;orts of Silver into the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">inions of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> For in all the Frontier Cities there is a Mint, where it is purified to the highe&s;t perfection, as is all the Gold and Silver in <HI>India,</HI> by the Kings Command, and coin'd into Money. Silver in Bars, or old Plate, which is bought without paying for the fa&s;hion, is the Silver by which you &s;hall lo&s;e lea&s;t: For as for coin'd Silver, there is no avoiding the lo&s;s of the Coinage. All their bargains are made, with a condition to pay in coin'd Silver within the pre&s;ent year. And if you make payment in old Silver, you mu&s;t re&s;olve to lo&s;e according to the time &s;ince it was fir&s;t Coin'd. In all places far remote from Cities, where the vulgar People have no great knowledg in Sil|ver: and where there are no Changers, they will not receive a piece of Silver, without putting it into the fire, to try whether it be good or no; And this is the common practice at all Ferries and Pa&s;&s;ages over Rivers. In regard their Boats are only made of O&s;ier, covered over with an Ox-hide, and by con&s;equence are very light; they keep them in the Woods, and will not take them upon their &s;houlders, till they have received their Money.</P>
<P>As for their Gold, the Merchants have &s;o many cunning tricks to hide it, that it &s;eldom comes to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">owledg of the Cu&s;tomers. They do all they can to &s;hift off paying the Cu&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that, &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e they do not run &s;o much hazard as at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of <HI>Europe.</HI> For in the <HI>Indian</HI> Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, if a man be caught in the fraud, he is quitted by paying double; ten in the hundred, in&s;tead of five: the King comparing the venture of the Merchant to a game at Hazard, where he plays quit or double. The King had granted to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captains, that they &s;hould not be &s;earched when they came a-&s;hore. But one day one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captains going to <HI>Tata,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Cities in <HI>India,</HI> a little above the Mouth of the River <HI>Indou,</HI> as he was going to pa&s;s the River, he was &s;top'd by the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, who &s;earch'd and rifl'd him, what-ever he could alledge to the contrary. They found Gold about him, of which he had already carried off &s;everal quantities, at &s;everal times, that he had gone from his Ship to the City; but they quitted him, upon paying the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, vex'd at &s;uch an affront, re&s;olv'd to revenge him&s;elf; which he did after a very plea&s;ant manner. He caus'd a &s;ucking-pig to be roa&s;ted, and putting it together with the dripping, and &s;awce, in a <HI>China</HI>-platter, covered with a linnen-cloath, he gave it a Slave to bring along after him to the City;
<PB N="18" REF="166">
imagining what would fall out. As it pa&s;s'd before the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, while the Governors or the <HI>Cha-bander,</HI> and the Mint-Ma&s;ters were &s;itting in the <HI>Divan,</HI> they fail'd not to &s;top him; and as the Slave went forward with the Plate cover'd, they told his Ma&s;ter that he mu&s;t come into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and that they mu&s;t &s;ee what he carried. The more the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man cry'd, <HI>that the Slave car|ried nothing that paid any Duties,</HI> the le&s;s he was believ'd; &s;o that after a long debate he took the Plate from his Slave, and carried it him&s;elf into the <HI>Divan;</HI> the Governour and the <HI>Cha-bander,</HI> gravely ask'd him, why he would not be obe|dient to the Laws? Upon which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, replying in a great heat, that he carried nothing which paid any duty, threw the Pigg among them with &s;uch a fury, that the Sawce and Pigg flew all upon their Garments. Now in regard that Swines-fle&s;h is an abomination to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who believe every thing defil'd that touches it; they were forc'd to change their Clothes, take down the Tape&s;try of the <HI>Divan,</HI> to pull down the <HI>Divan</HI> it &s;elf, and build another, not daring to &s;ay any thing to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man; for the <HI>Cha-bander,</HI> and Mint-Ma&s;ter are very ob&s;ervant to the Company, by whom they reap a great deal of profit. As for what concerns the Heads of the Companies, as well <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as <HI>Dutch,</HI> and their A&s;&s;ociates, they have &s;o great a re&s;pect for them, that they never &s;earch them at all, when they come a-&s;hore; though they will not &s;tick to conceal their Gold, like particular Merchants, and to carry it about them. The Trade of <HI>Tata,</HI> formerly very great, begins now to decay, becau&s;e the Mouth of the River grows more dangerous, and full of &s;hallows every day more than other, the Sand-hills having almo&s;t choak'd it up.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> finding they had learn'd the trick of rifling their Cloaths, &s;tudi'd out other little ways and contrivances to conceal their Gold: And the fa&s;hion of wearing Perriwigs being newly come out of <HI>Europe,</HI> they hid their <HI>Jacobus's, Ro&s;e-Nobles,</HI> and <HI>Ducats</HI> in the Net of their Perriwigs, every time they came a-&s;hore.</P>
<P>There was a Merchant that had a mind to convey &s;ome Boxes of Coral into <HI>Suratt,</HI> without the knowledge of the Cu&s;tomers. He Swam then into the Town, &s;ome days before the Ship was unladen, when it might be done &s;ecurely before the Cu&s;tomers had any &s;u&s;pition of any thing. But the Merchant repented him afterwards, the Commodity being &s;poyl'd. For the Water of <HI>Suratt</HI> River being always thick and muddy, there clung to the Coral, which had lain a long time in the Water, a &s;lime like a white cru&s;t or skin, which was difficult to be got off; &s;o that after the Coral was poli&s;h'd, he lo&s;t by it above twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Money which goes for currant through the whole extent of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Dominions; and to all the &s;orts of Gold and Silver, which is carri'd thither in <HI>Ingots</HI> to make profit thereof.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place you mu&s;t ob&s;erve that it is very profitable to buy Gold and Silver which has been wrought, to melt it into <HI>Ingots,</HI> and to refine it to the highe&s;t purity: For being refin'd, you pay not for the Portage of the Alloy, which was mix'd with it before: And carrying the Gold and Silver in Wedges, you pay neither to the Prince nor to the Mint what they exact for Coinage. If you carry coin'd Gold, the be&s;t Pieces are <HI>Jacobus's, Ro&s;e-Nobles, Albertus's,</HI> and other anci|ent Pieces, as well of <HI>Portugal,</HI> as of other Countries, and all &s;orts of Gold that have been coin'd in former Ages. For by all tho&s;e old Pieces the Merchant is &s;ure to gain. You may al&s;o reckon for good Gold, and which is proper to be carri'd thither, all the <HI>Ducats</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> as well tho&s;e coin'd by the &s;everal Prin|ces, as by the Imperial Towns, together with the <HI>Ducats</HI> of <HI>Poland, Hungary, Swedeland</HI> and <HI>Danemark;</HI> and indeed all &s;orts of <HI>Ducats</HI> are taken to be of the &s;ame goodne&s;s. The <HI>Venetian Ducats</HI> of Gold formerly pa&s;s'd for the be&s;t, and were worth four or five of our <HI>Sous,</HI> more than any others; but about a dozen years ago they &s;eem to have been alter'd, not going now for any more than the re&s;t. There are al&s;o <HI>Ducats</HI> which the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> Coins at <HI>Cairo,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Sally,</HI> and <HI>Morocco:</HI> But the&s;e three &s;orts are not &s;o good as the others, and are not worth &s;o much as they by four <HI>Sous</HI> of our Money.</P>
<P>Over all the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> all the Gold and Silver is weigh'd with Weights, which they call <HI>Tolla;</HI> which weigh nine Deneers, and eight grains of our Weights. When they have any quantity of Gold and Silver to &s;ell, the <HI>In|dians</HI> u&s;e yellow Copper-Weights, with the King's mark, to avoid cou&s;enage. And
  
<PB N="19" REF="166">
with the&s;e Weights they weigh all the Gold and Silver at once, provided it a|mount not to above a hundred <HI>Tolla's.</HI> For the Changers have no other weights, but from one <HI>Tolla</HI> to a hundred; and a hundred <HI>Tolla's</HI> come to 38 Ounces, 21 Deneers, and 8 Grains. As for the Gold and Silver which is not coin'd, if there be much, they e&s;&s;ay it; and having put it to the Touch, they bid to the utmo&s;t value to out-vye one another.</P>
<P>In regard there are &s;ome Merchants that have above forty or fifty thou|&s;and Ducats at a time, the <HI>Indians</HI> weigh them with a weight which is ju&s;t the weight of a hundred Ducats, which is al&s;o mark'd with the Kings Mark; and if the hundred Ducats weigh le&s;s than the weights, they put in &s;o many lit|tle &s;tones till the Scales are even; and after all is weigh'd, they make good to the Changer the weight of tho&s;e little &s;tones. But before they weigh the&s;e Gold-Coins, whether they be Ducats or other Pieces, they put the whole quantity in|to a Charcoal-fire, till they be red-hot; and then quench the Fire with water, and take them out again. This they do to find out them which are fal&s;e, and to melt off the Wax and Gum, which is cunningly dropt upon them to make them weigh the more. But becau&s;e there are &s;ome Pieces &s;o artfully hollow'd and &s;topt up again, that you cannot perceive it, though they have been in the fire, the Changers take the Pieces, and bend them; by which they know whether they be good or no; and tho&s;e which they &s;u&s;pect they cut in pieces. After they have viewed them all, they refine tho&s;e which they do not take to be good, and pay for &s;o much as proves to be good, as for good Ducats. All this Gold they Coin into that &s;ort of Money which they call <HI>Roupies</HI> of Gold; except tho&s;e Ducats, which are &s;tamp'd only up|on one &s;ide, which they &s;ell to the Merchants that come from <HI>Tartary,</HI> and other Northern Parts, as from the Kingdoms of <HI>Boutan, A&s;en,</HI> and other remote parts. With the&s;e Ducats the Women of tho&s;e Countries chiefly adorn them&s;elves, hanging them upon their Head-attire, and fixing them upon their foreheads. As for the other Ducats, that have no figures, they are not &s;o much as enquir'd after by the Northern Merchants.</P>
<P>As for all the other Pieces of Gold, there are great quantities of them Sold to the Gold&s;miths, to the Gold-wyar-drawers, and in general to all that work in Gold. For if they could put their Metal unmade into Roupies, they would never Coin; which they can only do at the Coronation of their Kings, to throw Silver Roupies among the People; or to &s;ell them to the Governours of the Provinces, and other Grandees of the Court, who then want great quantities of them to pre&s;ent to the new King at his fir&s;t coming to his Throne. For they have not always Jewels or other things rich enough to pre&s;ent him, as well at that time, as at another Fe&s;tival, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in due place, when they weigh the King every year. At &s;uch times I &s;ay, they are very glad of Gold Roupies; as al&s;o to pre&s;ent to &s;uch Favourites at the Court, by who&s;e intere&s;t they hope to gain higher Commands, and more con&s;iderable Go|vernments.</P>
<P>In one of my Travels, I found by experience the vertue of the&s;e Roupies of Gold. <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> Father of <HI>Orang-zeb</HI> who now Reigns, had given to one of the Lords of his Court, the Government of the Province of <HI>Tata,</HI> whereof <HI>Symdi</HI> is the Metropolis. Now though the very fir&s;t year of his Government, there were very great complaints made again&s;t him, by rea&s;on of the Tyranny which he exerci&s;ed over his People, and his great extortions, the King &s;uffered him to continue four years, and then recalled him. All the People of <HI>Tata</HI> were over joy'd&punc; believing the King had called him away, only to put him to death; but it fell out quite otherwi&s;e; for the King care&s;s'd him, and gave him the Government of <HI>Halabas,</HI> more con&s;iderable than that which he had quitted. This kind reception, which he had at the Kings hands, proceeded from this, that before he came to <HI>Agra,</HI> he had &s;ent before him a pre&s;ent of 50000 Roupies of Gold, and about 20000 Roupies of Gold more to <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> who had then the whole Power in her hands; as al&s;o to other Ladies and Lords at the Court, to &s;upport his Reputation. All the Courtiers are very de&s;irous to have a great quantity of Gold; becau&s;e it lies in a little room, and then becau&s;e they covet, as a great Honour, to leave va&s;t Sums behind them, to their Wives and Chil|dren, of which the King mo&s;t not know. For as I &s;hall tell you in another place,
 
<PB N="20" REF="167">
when any great Lord dies, the King is Heir to all his E&s;tate; his Wife having no more then his Jewels.</P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Roupies</HI> of Gold; you mu&s;t take notice, that they are not &s;o currant among the Merchants. For in regard one of them is not worth above fourteen <HI>Roupies,</HI> which make one and twenty Livres of our Money, at thirty Sous the <HI>Roupie,</HI> and that there are few of the&s;e <HI>Roupies</HI> of Gold to be had, but in the Hou&s;es of Great Men; when it falls out that they make any pay|ment, they will put them at a <HI>Roupie</HI> of Silver, or at lea&s;t at a fourth part of a <HI>Roupie</HI> more than it is worth, which will never turn to the Merchants profit. <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan</HI> the King's Uncle, to whom I had &s;old a parcel of Goods at 96000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> when he came to pay me, ask'd me what Money I would be content to take, whether Gold or Silver. Before I could return him an an&s;wer, he added, that if I would leave it to him, I &s;hould take Gold <HI>Roupies:</HI> Nor did he give me this advice, but becau&s;e he believ'd it would turn to his advantage: I told him I would be rul'd by him; thereupon he caus'd his Servants to tell me out &s;o ma|ny <HI>Roupies</HI> in Gold, as made up the ju&s;t Sum which was due: But he would force me to take the <HI>Roupie</HI> in Gold for fourteen <HI>Roupies</HI> and an half in Silver, though among the Merchants they went but for fourteen. I was not ignorant of it; but I thought it be&s;t to receive my Money according to the Prince's humour, in hopes he might make me amends another time, either for the whole, or part of what I might lo&s;e. I let him alone two days, after which I went to him again, and told him I had tried to put off his <HI>Roupies</HI> at the price I had received them; &s;o that in the payment of 96000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> I had lo&s;t 3428 and one 16<HI>th.</HI> the <HI>Roupie</HI> of Gold which he forc'd me to to take at fourteen <HI>Roupies</HI> and an half of Silver, be|ing worth but fourteen. Thereupon he fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, and told me he would &s;ee as many La&s;hes be&s;tow'd upon the Changer, or <HI>Holland</HI>-Broker, who&s;e fault &s;o|ever it were; that he would teach them to under&s;tand Money; that they were old <HI>Roupies,</HI> and were worth more by a &s;ixteenth part of a Silver <HI>Roupie,</HI> than the <HI>Roupies</HI> which were coin'd at that time. In regard I knew the humour of the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> Princes, with whom there is no conte&s;ting. I let him &s;ay what he pleas'd; but when he came to him&s;elf, and began to put on a &s;miling look, I de|&s;ir'd him that he would be pleas'd to let me return the Summ which I had re|ceived, the next day; or el&s;e that he would be plea'sd to pay me what was want|ing, and that I would take a <HI>Roupie</HI> at 14 and one 16<HI>th.</HI> &s;ince he a&s;&s;ur'd me they were worth &s;o much. The Prince for a while gave me a &s;curvy look, not &s;o much as &s;peaking one word. At length he ask'd me, whether I had &s;till the Pearl, which he had refus'd to buy. I told him I had, and immediately pull'd it out of my Bo&s;ome, and gave it him. The Pearl was large, and of a good Water, but ill|&s;hap'd; which was the rea&s;on he refus'd it before. When I had given it to him, well, &s;aid he, let us talk no more of what is pa&s;t; how much will you have, in a word, for this Pearl? I ask'd him &s;even thou&s;and <HI>Roupies,</HI> and indeed rather than I would have carri'd it into <HI>France,</HI> I would have taken three. If I give thee, &s;aid he, &s;even thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> for this Pearl, I &s;hall make thee amends for the lo&s;s thou complain'&s;t of in the fir&s;t bargain. Come to Morrow, and I will give thee five thou&s;and <HI>Roupies,</HI> and that's very fair: Thou &s;halt have al&s;o a Calaat and an Hor&s;e. I made my obey&s;ance to him, and de&s;ir'd him to give me an Hor&s;e that &s;hould be young, and fit for &s;ervice, becau&s;e I had a great journey to take. The next day he &s;ent me a Robe, a Cloak, two Girdles, and a Cap; which is all the Apparel that the Princes are wont to give to tho&s;e to whom they intend any Honour. The Cloak and Robe was of Satin purfled with Gold; the two Girdles &s;trip'd with Gold and Silver; the Cap was of Calicut, dy'd into a Flame-colour, with &s;tripes of Gold: The Hor&s;e had no Saddle, but was covered with a green Velvet foot-cloath, edg'd about with a &s;mall Silver-fringe. The Bridle was very &s;trait, with Silver-&s;tuds in &s;ome places. I believe the Hor&s;e had never been Back'd; for &s;o &s;oon as I brought him to the <HI>Holland-</HI>Hou&s;e, where I then lodg'd, a young man got upon his Back; but he was no &s;ooner on, but the Hor&s;e flung and pranc'd at that rate, that having kick'd down an Hutt that &s;tood in the Court, he had like to have kill'd the <HI>Hollander.</HI> Finding that &s;uch a Re&s;ty-Hor&s;e was not for my turn, I &s;ent him back to
<HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> and relating the Story to him, I told him I did not believe that he de&s;ir'd I &s;hould return into my Countrey to
<PB N="21" REF="167">
bring him back &s;ome rarities which I had promis'd him, as he made me be|lieve he did. All the while I talk'd, he laugh'd, and afterwards &s;ent for the Hor&s;e which his Father in his life time us'd to ride upon. It was a tall <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Hor&s;e, that had formerly co&s;t five thou&s;and Crowns, but was then twenty eight years old. They brought him bridl'd and &s;addl'd, and the Prince would needs have me get up in his pre&s;ence. He had one of the mo&s;t &s;tately walks that ever I knew in a Hor&s;e: and when I alighted, well, &s;aid he, art thou &s;a|tisfied? I dare &s;ay, that Hor&s;e will never give thee a fall. I thank'd him, and at the &s;ame time took my leave of him; and the next day, before my departure, he &s;ent me a great Basket of Apples. It was one of the &s;ix that <HI>Cha|jehan</HI> had &s;ent him, as they came from the Kingdom of <HI>Kachemir;</HI> there was in the Basket al&s;o a great <HI>Per&s;ian Melon:</HI> All this might be worth a hundred Roupies, which I pre&s;ented to the <HI>Holland</HI> Commanders Wife. As for the Hor&s;e I rode him to <HI>Golconda,</HI> where I &s;old him for five hundred Roupies, as old as he was, being a good lu&s;ty Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>To return to our di&s;cour&s;e of Money, I will add this to what I have &s;aid already, that you mu&s;t never carry <HI>Louis's,</HI> of Gold to the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> nor <HI>Italian</HI> Pi&s;tols, nor any other &s;ort of Money coin'd within the&s;e few years; for there is great lo&s;s by it; for the <HI>Indians</HI> refine all, and count only upon the refinings. La&s;tly, every one &s;trives to &s;teal the cu&s;tom of their Gold; and when the Merchant has got the knack of concealing it, he may gain five or &s;ix of our Sous in every Ducat.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;orts of Silver Money; which you mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h in|to money of the Country, and Forreign Money: And fir&s;t of the Forreign Coins.</P>
<P>The Forreign Silver Coins which are carried into the <HI>Indies,</HI> are the Rix|dollars of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Reals of <HI>Spain.</HI> The fir&s;t are brought by the Merchants that come from <HI>Poland,</HI> from the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Borders of <HI>Mu&s;co|via.</HI> The others by tho&s;e that come from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and the greate&s;t part by the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who &s;ell their Silk into <HI>Europe.</HI> All the&s;e merchants endeavour to convey their Silver through <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> without be|ing di&s;covered; for if the Cu&s;tomers find it out, they will be forced to carry their Silver to the Mint-Ma&s;ters to be coined into <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's,</HI> which is the Kings Coin; the&s;e <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's</HI> being carried into <HI>India,</HI> are again coined into Rou|pies, whereby the Merchant lo&s;es ten and a quarter <HI>per Cent.</HI> as well by rea&s;on of the coinage, as by paying the Kings duties in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>To let you under&s;tand in a few words, how they came to lo&s;e this ten and a quarter <HI>per Cent.</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and &s;ometimes more, according to the nature of the Reals, which they u&s;ually carry into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> you mu&s;t call to mind, what I have already &s;aid concerning the Money and Exchanges of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the fir&s;t Volume. I ob&s;erv'd, that a Real in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> goes for 23 <HI>Chaez,</HI> which make three <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's,</HI> and a quarter; and that &s;ometimes, when Silver is &s;carce, they will give a <HI>Chaez</HI> and a half for one. That the <HI>Aba&s;&s;i</HI> is worth four <HI>Chaez,</HI> and the <HI>Toman</HI> fifty <HI>Aba&s;&s;i's,</HI> or two hundred <HI>Chaez.</HI> If you carry &s;ix <HI>Tomans</HI> and a half to the <HI>Indies,</HI> you have for every <HI>Toman</HI> twenty nine <HI>Roupies</HI> and a half; and con&s;equently for &s;ix <HI>Tomans</HI> and a half, a hundred and ninety-one <HI>Roupies</HI> and a quarter. If you carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> Reals of <HI>Sevile,</HI> for a hundred you &s;hall have from 213 to 215 <HI>Roupies.</HI> If you carry <HI>Mexi|can</HI> Reals; for a hundred you &s;hall have no more than 212. So that when for a hundred Reals you have but two hundred and twelve <HI>Roupies,</HI> you gain ten Reals and a quarter, in an hundred Reals; but by the <HI>Sevillian</HI> Reals you profit eleven <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>There are three or four &s;orts of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Reals, and they give for a hundred according to their goodne&s;s, from 218 to 214 and 215 <HI>Roupies.</HI> The be&s;t of all are tho&s;e of <HI>Sevil</HI> for when they are full weight, they will give for a hun|dred, 213 <HI>Roupies;</HI> and &s;ometimes 215, according as Silver is either &s;carce or plentiful.</P>
<P>The Real of <HI>Spain</HI> ought to weigh three Drams, &s;even Grains and a half more than two <HI>Roupies.</HI> But the Silver of the <HI>Roupies</HI> is much better. For the <HI>Roupy</HI> is in weight eleven Deneers and fourteen Grains; but the <HI>Sevil</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="168">
Real, like our white Crown, is but ju&s;t eleven Deneers. The <HI>Maxican</HI> Real goes at ten Deneers and twenty-one Grains. For the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Real, that weighs &s;eventy-three Vals, you have four Mamoudi's and a half, and one Mamoudi is worth twenty Pecha's; but they mu&s;t be very good, and as I have &s;aid already, &s;eventy-three Vals in weight: eighty-one Vals making an Ounce, one Val com|ing to &s;even Deneers.</P>
<P>For the Rixdollars of <HI>Germany,</HI> in regard they are heavier than the Reals, they will give you for an hundred, as high as an hundred and &s;ixteen Roupies. Where you are to take notice, that in giving for an hundred Reals, or an hundred Rix|dollars, two hundred and fifteen, or two hundred and &s;ixteen Roupies, it &s;eems that every Roupy ought to be worth le&s;s than thirty Sous. But if the Merchant count the Portage of the Silver, and the Cu&s;toms, he will find that every Roupy will &s;tand him in more. But that the Merchant may make his profit, he mu&s;t take notice, that all the Reals of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Sevil,</HI> are in weight one and twenty Deneers and eight Grains, that is, five hundred and twelve Grains; and for tho&s;e that are no better then our white Crown, they are to be in weight one and twenty Deneers and three Grains, which makes five hundred and nine Grains. All Dollars and Reals are weigh'd, a hundred at a time, and when they are want|ing in weight, they add little &s;tones, as when they weigh Gold, according to what I &s;hall tell you by and by.</P>
<P>We come now to the Money of the Country. The <HI>Indian</HI> Money is the Silver Roupy, the Half, Quarter, Eighteenth and Sixteenth part. The weight of the Roupy is nine Deneers and one Grain; the value of the Silver is eleven Deneers and fourteen Grains. They have al&s;o another &s;ort of Silver Money, which they call Mamoudi's, but this goes no-where but in <HI>Surat,</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Guzerat.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> have al&s;o a &s;ort of &s;mall Copper Money, which is call'd Pecha; which is worth about two of our Liards, a Liard being the fourth part of a Sous. There is al&s;o the Half Pecha, Two Pecha's, and Four Pecha's. Accor|ding to the cu&s;tom of the Province where you Travel, you have for a Roupy of Silver more or le&s;s of the&s;e Pecha's. In my la&s;t Travels, a Roupy went at <HI>Surat</HI> for nine and forty Pecha's. But the time was, when it was worth fifty, and another time, when it went but for &s;ix and forty. At <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Ge|hanabat,</HI> the Roupy was valued at fifty-five and fifty-&s;ix Pecha's. And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the nearer you go to the Copper Mines, the more Pecha's you have for a Roupy. As for the Mamoudi, it is always valued at forty Pecha's.</P>
<P>There are two other &s;orts of &s;mall Money in the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mo|gull,</HI> which are little bitter Almonds and Shells. The&s;e little bitter Almonds, which are brought out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> are only made u&s;e of in the Province of <HI>Guze|ratt;</HI> as I have ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t part of my Relations. They grow in dry and barren places among&s;t the Rocks, and the Tree, that bears them, is almo&s;t like our Ba&s;tard <HI>Spani&s;h-Broom.</HI> They call the&s;e Almonds <HI>Baden:</HI> Nor is there any <HI>Coloquintida</HI> &s;o bitter. They give for a Pecha &s;ometimes thirty five, and &s;ome|times forty.</P>
<P>Their other &s;mall Money are the little Shells which they call <HI>Cori;</HI> the &s;ides whereof turn circularly inward: Nor are they to be found in any part of the World, but in the <HI>Maldives</HI> I&s;lands. They are the greate&s;t part of the Revenue of the King of that I&s;land. For they are tran&s;ported into all the Territories of the Great <HI>Mogull;</HI> into the Kingdoms of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and <HI>Golconda;</HI> and into the I&s;lands of <HI>America</HI> to &s;erve in&s;tead of Money. Near the Sea they give 80 for a Pecha. But the further you go from the Sea, the le&s;s you have; &s;o that at <HI>Agra,</HI> they will not give you above 50 or 55 for a Pecha. As to what remains accord|ing to the Accompt of the <HI>Indians,</HI>

Exchange. In regard that the&s;e Bankers hold a Corre&s;pondence with the Gover|nours of the Province, they rai&s;e as they plea&s;e them&s;elves, the Roupie for the <HI>Pecha's,</HI> and the <HI>Pecha's</HI> for the <HI>Shells.</HI> All the <HI>Jews</HI> that deal in Money and Ex|change in the Empire of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> are accounted a mo&s;t &s;ubtil &s;ort of People. But in the <HI>Iudies</HI> they would be &s;carce thought fit to be Apprentices to the&s;e Bankers. They have one very bad cu&s;tom in making of Payments: And I have already ob&s;erv'd it, in reference to their Roupies of Gold. When they make any Payment in that &s;ort of Money, they tell ye, 'twas a great while ago that any Silver Roupie was coin'd; that they are worth le&s;s than tho&s;e which are new, or but lately coin'd; for that by pa&s;&s;ing through many hands they wear away, and become lighter. And therefore when you make any bargain, you mu&s;t always agree to be paid in Roupies <HI>Cha-jenni,</HI> that is, in new Silver; otherwi&s;e, they will
<PB N="24" REF="169">
pay you in <HI>Roupies</HI> coin'd &s;ome fifteen or twenty years ago, and upward; where|by you will lo&s;e four in the hundred. For they will have one fourth, or at lea&s;t one eighth <HI>per Cent.</HI> allow'd for tho&s;e that were coin'd but two years before: So that the poor People that cannot read the year wherein the <HI>Roupies</HI> were coin'd, are &s;ubject to be cheated; for they will always abate a <HI>Pecha</HI> or a half a <HI>Pecha</HI> upon a <HI>Roupie,</HI> or three or four <HI>Cori's</HI> upon a <HI>Pecha.</HI></P>
<P>As for counterfeit Silver, there is very little among&s;t them. If you receive one fal&s;e <HI>Roupie</HI> in a Bagg from any particular Per&s;on, 'tis better to cut it to pieces, and lo&s;e it, than to &s;peak of it; for if it &s;hould come to be known, there might be danger in it. For you are commanded by the Kings Law to return the Bagg where you received it; and to return it from one to another, till you can find out the Counterfeiter; who if he be apprehended, is only &s;entenc'd to lo&s;e his hand. If the Counterfeiter cannot be found, and that it be thought that he who paid the Money is not guilty, he is acquitted upon &s;ome &s;mall amercement. This brings great profit to the Changers. For when there is any Sum of Money receiv'd or paid, the Merchants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;e him to look it over, and for their pains, they have one &s;ixteenth of a <HI>Roupie</HI> in the hundred.</P>
<P>As for the Money which is paid out of the <HI>Sarquet,</HI> or Kings Exchequer, there is never any found that is counterfeit: For all the Money that is carri'd in thither, is exactly view'd by the Kings Bankers&punc; The Great Lords have al&s;o their par|ticular Bankers. Before they put up the Money into the Trea&s;ury, they throw it into a great Charcoal-fire, and when the <HI>Roupies</HI> are red-hot, they quench the fire, by throwing water&punc;upon it; and then take out the Money. If there be any Piece that is white or that has the lea&s;t mark of Alloy, it is pre&s;ently cut in pieces. As often as the&s;e <HI>Roupies</HI> are carried into the Trea&s;ury, they mark the Pieces with a Puncheon, which makes an hole, but not quite through; and there are &s;ome Pieces that have &s;even or eight holes made in that manner, to &s;hew that they have been &s;o many times in the Exchequer. They are all put, a thou&s;and Pieces together, in a Bagg, &s;eal'd with the Seal of the great Trea&s;urer, and the number of years &s;uper&s;crib'd, &s;ince&punc;they were coin'd. And here you are to take notice, whence the Trea&s;urers profit ari&s;es, as well that of the Kings Trea|&s;urer, as that of the particular Trea&s;urers of the Great Lords of the Kingdom. When there is any bargain made, they agree for new <HI>Roupies</HI> coin'd the &s;ame year: but when they come to receive the payment, the Trea&s;urers will make it in old <HI>Roupies,</HI> wherein there is a lo&s;s of &s;ix <HI>per Cent.</HI> So that if they will have new Silver, the Merchants mu&s;t compound with the Trea&s;urer. In my fifth Voy|age, I went to vi&s;it <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan</HI> according to my promi&s;e, to let him have the fir&s;t &s;ight of what I brought along with me. So that as &s;oon as I arriv'd at <HI>Su|ratt,</HI> I &s;ent him word; and received his Orders to meet him at <HI>Choupart,</HI> a City in the Province of <HI>Decan,</HI> to which he had laid Siege. Coming to him, in a lit|tle time, and a few words, I &s;old him the greate&s;t part of what I had brought along with me out of <HI>Europe:</HI> And he told me that he expected every day, that Money &s;hould be &s;ent him from <HI>Suratt</HI> to pay the Army, and to pay me al&s;o at the &s;ame time for what he had bought of me I could not imagin however, that &s;o great a Prince as he, that commanded &s;o great an Army, had not &s;tore of Money by him; but rather conjectur'd, that he had an intention to make me &s;ome abatement, up|on tho&s;e Pieces which he would put upon me in payment, as he had &s;erv'd me be|fore. It fell out, as I fore&s;aw. But for Provi&s;ions for my &s;elf, my men, and my Hor&s;es, he took &s;uch order, that there was great plenty brought me, night and morning, and for the mo&s;t part he &s;ent for me my &s;elf, to his own Table. Ten or twelve days thus pa&s;t away, and not a word of the Money that I expected: So that being re&s;olv'd to take my leave of him, I went to his Tent. He appear'd to be &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd, and looking upon me with a frowning-brow&punc; wherefore will you be gone, &s;aid he, before you are paid? or who d&punc;you think, &s;hall pay you afterwards, if you go away before you receive your Money? Upon the&s;e words, with a countenance as &s;tern as his, my King, replied I, will &s;ee me paid. For his goodne&s;s is &s;uch, that he cau&s;es all his Subjects to be paid; that have not receiv'd &s;atisfaction for &s;uch Goods as they fell in Forreign Countries. And what cour&s;e will he take, an&s;wer'd he in a great choler: with two or three &s;tout Men of War, &s;aid I, which he will &s;end either to the Port of <HI>Suratt,</HI> or towards the Coa&s;ts to
<PB N="25" REF="169">
wait for the Ships that come from <HI>Mocca.</HI> He &s;eemed to be netled at the reply, but not daring to give any more way to his choler, he ordered his Trea&s;urer im|mediately to give me a Letter of Exchange to <HI>Aurengaebad.</HI> I was the more glad of that, becau&s;e it was a place through which I was to pa&s;s in my way to <HI>Golcanda;</HI> be&s;ides that, it would &s;pare me the carriage and the hazards of my Money. The next day I had my Bill of Exchange, and took Ieave of the Prince, who was nothing di&s;plea&s;ed, but told me, that if I return'd to the <HI>Indies,</HI> I &s;hould not fail to come and &s;ee him, which I did in my &s;ixth and la&s;t Voyage. When I came to <HI>Suratt,</HI> he was at <HI>Bengala,</HI> where I &s;old him all the re&s;t of my Goods that I could not put off either to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or great <HI>Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the payment of my Money, I was no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Aureng|gabat,</HI> but I went to find the great Trea&s;urer; who no &s;ooner &s;aw me, but he told me, he knew wherefore I came; that he had received Letters of advice three days before, and that he had already taken the Money out of the Trea&s;ury to pay me. When he had brought me all the Baggs, I cau&s;ed my Banker to open them, who &s;aw them to be Roupies, by which I was to lo&s;e two in the hundred. Upon that I thank'd the Trea&s;urer very heartily, telling him, I under&s;tood no &s;uch deal|ing, and that I would &s;end and complain of him to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kam;</HI> and declare to him that he &s;hould either give order that I &s;hould be paid in new Silver, or el&s;e let me have my Goods again, which I pre&s;ently did. But not receiving&punc; an an&s;wer &s;o &s;oon as I knew I might have done, I went to the Trea&s;urer, and told him, I would go my &s;elf, and fetch away my Goods. I believe he had received or|der what to do, for &s;eeing I was re&s;olved to go; he told me he was very unwilling I &s;hould put my &s;elf to &s;o much trouble, and that it would be better for us to agree among our &s;elves. After many conte&s;ts about the two in the hundred, which he would have made me lo&s;e, I was contented to abate one, and had lo&s;t the other, had I not happily met with a Banker who wanted Silver, and had a Bill of Ex|change to pay at <HI>Golconda;</HI> &s;o that he was glad to make u&s;e of mine, and gave me a Bill to be paid at <HI>Golconda,</HI> being my full Summ, at fifteen days &s;ight.</P>

<P>Here it will not be ami&s;s to give you an hint, how far the cunning extends, not only of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> or Changers, but of all the <HI>Indians</HI> in general; and it &s;hall &s;uffice to give you one example, which is very particular, and of which our <HI>Europeans</HI> make no account: Which is this; that of all the Gold, which re|mains upon the &s;tone upon which they make the E&s;&s;ay, and of which we make no reckoning, they are &s;o far from lo&s;ing the lea&s;t atome of that &s;mall matter, that they fetch it all off, by means of a Ball made half of Black-pitch, and half of Soft-wax, with which they rub the &s;tone that carries the Gold; at the end of &s;ome years the Ball will &s;hine, and teen they get out all the Gold that &s;ticks to it This Ball is about the bigne&s;s of one of our Tennis-Balls; and the Stone is &s;uch a one as our Gold&s;miths generally u&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus much of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es and Money currant among the <HI>Indians.</HI> It remains to &s;peak of their manner of Exchange.</P>
<P>As all the Goods which are made in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogull,</HI> and &s;ome part of the Kingdoms of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> are brought to <HI>Suratt</HI> to be tran&s;ported into &s;everal parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> the Merchants, when they go from <HI>Surat</HI> to buy Commodities in the &s;everal Cities where they are made, as at <HI>Lahor, Agra, Amadabat, Seronge, Brampour, Dasa, Patna, Banarous, Golconda Decan, Vi&s;apour,</HI> and <HI>Dultabat,</HI> take up Money a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and are di&s;charg'd at the places where they go, by giving kind for kind. But when it happens that the Merchant is &s;hort of Money in tho&s;e places, and that there is a nece&s;&s;ity&punc; for him to take up Money to compleat his Markets, he mu&s;t then return it at <HI>Suratt</HI> with|in two Months, paying Monthly for the Change.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lahor</HI> to <HI>Suratt</HI> the Exchange goes at &s;ix and a quarter <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Amadabat,</HI> from one, to one and an half.</P>

<P>From <HI>Daca,</HI> at ten.</P>
<P>From <HI>Banarou,</HI> at &s;ix.</P>
<P>From the three la&s;t places they make their Bills of Exchange only to <HI>Agra;</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="170">

<P>From <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> at three.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dultabat,</HI> from one to one and an half.</P>
<P>Some years the Exchange ri&s;es from one to two <HI>per Cent.</HI> by rea&s;on of certain Raja's or petty Va&s;&s;al Princes that di&s;turb Trade, every one pretending that the Mechandizes ought to pa&s;s through his Countrey, and pay Toll. There are two particularly between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Amadabatt,</HI> the one called the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Antivar,</HI> and the other the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Bergam,</HI> who very much mole&s;t the Merchants for this very cau&s;e. But you may avoid pa&s;&s;ing through the Territories of the&s;e Prin|ces, taking auother road from <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Suratt,</HI> thorough <HI>Seronge</HI> and <HI>Brampour.</HI> But they are fertil Lands, divided with &s;everal Rivers, witout Bridges or Boats, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to go that way, till two Months after the rains are fallen. Which is the rea&s;on that tho&s;e Merchants who mu&s;t be at <HI>Suratt</HI> when the &s;ea&s;on permits them to take the Sea, are forc'd to pa&s;s through the Territories of the&s;e two <HI>Raja's,</HI> becau&s;e they can pa&s;s that way at all times, even in the time that the rains fall, which only knit and harden the Sand.</P>
<P>Nor are you to wonder that the Exchange runs &s;o high; for they that tru&s;t out their Money, run the hazard, by obligation, of lo&s;ing their Money, if the Mer|chants &s;hould be robb'd.</P>
<P>When you come to <HI>Suratt</HI> to Embarque, there is Money enough. For it is the greate&s;t Trade of the Grandees of the <HI>Indies</HI> to venture their Money by Sea from thence for <HI>Ormus, Bal&s;ara,</HI> and <HI>Mocca;</HI> nay even as far as <HI>Bantam, Achen,</HI> and the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands. For <HI>Mocca</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> the change runs from 22 to 24 <HI>per Cent.</HI> And to <HI>Ormus,</HI> from 16 to 20. And to the other places which I have nam ed, the change runs proportionable to the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have but one word to &s;ay of their Weights and Mea&s;ures; I have given you in the Margin the fifth part of an Ell of <HI>Agra,</HI> and the fourth part of an Ell of <HI>Amadabat</HI> and <HI>Suratt.</HI> As for their Weights, the <HI>Men</HI> is generally 69 Pound, and the Pound 16 Ounces. But the <HI>Men</HI> which they weigh their <HI>Indigo</HI> withal, is but 53 Pound. At <HI>Suratt</HI> they talk of a <HI>Serre,</HI> which is one and three fourths of a Pound, and the Pound is 16 Ounces.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Carriages, and the manner of Travelling in <HI>India.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEfore you &s;et forward upon the road, it will be convenient to &s;peak of their Carriages and manner of travelling in <HI>India,</HI> which, in my opinion, is more commodious than any thing that has been invented for ea&s;e in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> Quite otherwi&s;e it is in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they neither make u&s;e of A&s;&s;es, Mules, or Hor&s;es, but tran&s;port all their Wares to the <HI>Indies</HI> upon Oxen, or in Wains, their Countries being &s;o near to one another. If any Merchant carries an Hor&s;e out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> 'tis only for &s;hew; or to walk in his hand, or to &s;ell to &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Prince.</P>
<P>They will lay upon an Oxes back 300, or 350 pound weight, and it is no won|derful thing to &s;ee ten or twelve thou&s;and Oxen at a time all laden with Rice, Corn and Salt, in &s;uch places where they exchange tho&s;e Commodities: Carrying Corn where only Rice grows, Rice where only Corn grows, and Salt where there is none at all. They make u&s;e of Camels &s;ometimes, but very rarely, they being particularly appointed to carry the luggage of great Per&s;onages. When the &s;ea|&s;on requires ha&s;t, and that they would &s;peedily conveigh their Merchandize to <HI>Suratt</HI> to &s;hip them off, they load them upon Oxen, and not in Wains. And in re|gard that the Territories of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> are very well manur'd. the Fields
<PB N="28" REF="171">
are fenc'd with very good Ditches; and to every Field there belongs a Pond to pre&s;erve the water. This is this great inconvenience for Travellers; that when they meet with the&s;e numerous Caravans in &s;treight places, they are forc'd to &s;tay two or three days till they are all pa&s;t by. They that drive the&s;e Oxen, follow no other Calling as long as they live, nor do they dwell in hou&s;es; yet they carry their Wives and Children along with them. There are &s;ome among them that have an hundred Oxen of their own, others more or le&s;s; and they have always one, who is their Chief, that takes as much &s;tate as a Prince, and has his Chain of Pearl hanging about his neck. When the Caravan that carries the Corn, and that which carries the Salt happen to meet, rather than yield the road, they frequently enter into very bloody Di&s;putes. The Great <HI>Mogull</HI> con&s;idering one day that the&s;e quarrels were very prejudicial to Trade, and the tran&s;portation of nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions from place to place, &s;ent for the two Chiefs of the Caravan, and after he had exhorted them, for the common good and their own intere&s;t, to live quietly together, and not to quarrel and fight when they met, gave to each of them a Leck, or an hundred thou&s;and Roupies, and a Chain of Pearl.</P>
<P>That the Reader may the better under&s;tand the manner of Travelling in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> he is to take notice, that among the Idolaters of that Country there are four Tribes, which are called <HI>Manari's,</HI> each of which may con&s;i&s;t of an hundred thou|&s;and Souls. The&s;e people live always in Tents, and live only upon the tran&s;porting of Merchandize from Countrey to Countrey. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Tribes carry no|thing but Corn. the &s;econd Rice, the third Pul&s;e, and the fourth Salt, which they fetch from <HI>Suratt,</HI> and all along from as far as <HI>Cape-Camorin.</HI> The&s;e Tribes are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in this manner: Their Prie&s;ts, of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in another place, mark the forheads of the fir&s;t, with a red-Gum, about the bredth of a Crown; and then they draw a &s;treak all the length of his no&s;e, &s;ticking grains of Wheat upon it, &s;ometimes ten, and &s;ometimes twelve. Tho&s;e of the &s;econd Tribe are mark'd with yellow-Gumin the &s;ame place, with grains of Rice. Tho&s;e of the third are mark'd with a grey-Gum, down to the &s;houlders, and grains of Millet. Tho&s;e of the fourth Tribe carry tied about their necks a Bagg, with a great lump of Salt in it, weighing &s;ometimes eight or ten pounds, (for the hea|vier it is, the more they glory in carrying it;) and with this Bagg they thump their &s;tomacks, as a &s;ign of repentance every morning before they &s;ay their Pray|ers. They have all in general a little line or twi&s;t, like a Scarf, about their necks, at the end whereof hangs a little Silver-box, like a Relique-box, wherein they enclo&s;e a little &s;uper&s;titious writing which their Prie&s;ts give them; they tie them al&s;o about their Oxen and other Cattel, which are bred in their Herds, for which they have a particular affection, and love them as tenderly as children, e&s;pecially if they have no children of their own. Their Women wear only a piece of Ca|licut white or painted, &s;ome &s;ix or five times doubled from their wa&s;ts down|ward. From their wa&s;ts upward they cut their fle&s;h into &s;everal forms of Flowers, as they do that apply Cupping-gla&s;&s;es, which they paint in various colours with the juice of Grapes, that their skin &s;eems to be all made of Flowers.</P>
<P>Every morning, while the men load the Bea&s;ts, and that the Women fold up the Tents, the Prie&s;ts that follow them, &s;et up in the mo&s;t convenient place of the Plain where they lodg'd a certain Idol in the form of a Serpent in wreaths, upon a Perch &s;ix or &s;even foot high; to which they come all in files to wor&s;hip, their Women going three times about. After the Ceremony is over, the Prie&s;ts take care of the Idol, and load it upon an Ox particularly appointed for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The Caravan of Waggons &s;eldom exceeds the number of an hundred or two hundred at mo&s;t. Every Waggon is drawn by ten or twelve Oxen; and attended by four Souldiers, which the Per&s;on that ows the Merchandize isoblig'd to pay- Two of them march upon each &s;ide of the Waggon, over which there are two Ropes thrown a-cro&s;s, the ends whereof they hold in their hands, to the end, that if the Waggon come to leane on one &s;ide in ill-way, the two Souldiers on the other &s;ide may keep it from over-turning by pulling the Ropes with all their &s;trength.</P>
<P>All the Waggons that come to <HI>Suratt,</HI> either from <HI>Agra,</HI> or any other parts of the Empire, and which return through <HI>Agra,</HI> or <HI>Janabatt,</HI> are bound to carry
<PB N="29" REF="171">
back the Lime that comes from <HI>Barocha,</HI> which, after it is temper'd, and laid on, becomes as hard as Marble.</P>
<P>I come now to the manner of travelling in <HI>India,</HI> to which purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of Oxen in&s;tead of Hor&s;es, and there are &s;ome, who&s;e pace is as ea&s;y as the amble of our Hackneys. But you mu&s;t take a care, when you either buy or hire an Ox to ride upon, that the horns be not a bove a foot in length. For if they be longer, when the flies begin to &s;ting, he will chafe, and to&s;s back his horns, and &s;trike them into the &s;tomack of the Rider, as oftentimes it has hapned. The&s;e Oxen are rid like our Hor&s;es, and in&s;tead of Snaffles or Bitts, they have only a Rope drawn through the mu&s;cly part of the muzzle or no&s;trils. In firm ground where there are no &s;tones, they never &s;hooe their Oxen; but only in rough pla|ces, where not only the &s;tones, but the heat will wa&s;t and chop the hoof. Where|as in <HI>Europe</HI> we tie our Oxen by the horns, the <HI>Indians</HI> only put a thick tru&s;s upon their necks, that keeps fa&s;t a Coller of Leather four fingers broad, which they have nothing to do but to put about their necks when they fa&s;ten them to the Waggon.</P>
<P>They u&s;e al&s;o for Travel little Coaches, but very light, that will hold two per&s;ons; but generally they ride alone for more ea&s;e, carrying only their ne|ce&s;&s;ary Cloak-Bags along with them; with a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of Wine, and a &s;mall quantity of Provi&s;ions, for which there is a proper place under the Coach, where they tye the two Oxen. The&s;e Coaches have their Curtains and Seats like ours, yet are not hung: But in my la&s;t Travels I caus'd one to be made after our manner; and the two Oxen that drew it, co&s;t me near upon &s;ix-hundred Roupies. Nor is the Reader to wonder at the price; for there are &s;ome of the&s;e Oxen that are very &s;trong, and that will travel upon the trot twelve or fifteen leagues a-day for &s;ixty days together. When they have gone half the days journey, they give them two or three Balls, as big as one of our two-penny-loaves, of Wheat kneaded up with butter and black-&s;ugar. The hire of a Coach comes to a Roupie a-day more or le&s;s. From <HI>Suratt</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> is forty days jour|ney, and you pay for thewhole journey from forty to forty-five Roupies. From <HI>Suratt</HI> to <HI>Golconda,</HI> being almo&s;t the &s;ame di&s;tance, the &s;ame price is ob&s;erved; and by the &s;ame proportion you may travel over all the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>They who have more to &s;pend, for their own ea&s;e make u&s;e of a <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> wherein they travel very commodiou&s;ly. This is a &s;ort of little Couch &s;ix or &s;e|ven foot long, and three broad, with bali&s;ters round about it. A &s;ort of Cane, call'd <HI>Bambouc,</HI> which they bend like an Arch, &s;u&s;tains the covering of the <HI>Pal|lanquin,</HI> which is either of Satin or Cloath of Gold; and when the Sun lies up|on one &s;ide, a Slave that goes by the &s;ide, takes care to pull down the covering. Another Slave carries at the end of a long &s;tick a kind of Target of O&s;ier, cover|ed over with &s;ome gentile &s;tuff, to pre&s;erve the per&s;on that is in the <HI>Pallanquin</HI> from the heat of the Sun, when he turns and lies upon his face. The two ends of the <HI>Bambouc</HI> are fa&s;tned on both &s;ides to the body of the <HI>Pallanquin</HI> between two &s;ticks join'd together like a <HI>Saltir</HI> or St. <HI>Andrews-cro&s;s,</HI> every one of tho&s;e two &s;ticks being five or &s;ix foot long. There are &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Bambouc's</HI> that co&s;t two hundred Crowns; I my &s;elf have paid an hundred and twenty. Three men for the mo&s;t part apply them&s;elves to each of the&s;e two ends to carry the <HI>Pal|lanquin</HI> upon their &s;houlders; &s;ome on the right, and &s;ome on the left, and they go &s;wifter than our Sedan-men, and with a much more ea&s;y pace, as being that which they practice from their youth. You give to every one for all things not above four Roupies a Month; but it &s;tands you in above five if the journey be long, and exceed &s;ixty days labour.</P>
<P>Whether it be in a Coach, or <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> he that will travel honourably in the <HI>Indies,</HI> mu&s;t take along with him twenty or thirty armed men, with Bows and Arrows &s;ome, others with Mu&s;quets; and they have the &s;ame rate with tho&s;e that carry the <HI>Pallanquin.</HI> Sometimes for more magnificence they carry a Ban|ner, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> do, for the honour of their Companies. The&s;e Souldiers are not only for &s;hew, but they watch for your defence, keeping Centinels, and relieving one another, and are very &s;tudious to give content. For you mu&s;t know, that in the Towns where you take them into &s;ervice, they have a Chieftain, that is re&s;pon&s;ible for their fidelity, who for his good word has two Roupies a-piece of every one.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="172">
In the great Villages there is generally a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> that commands, of whom you may buy Mutton, Pullets, or Pidgeons. But where there live none but <HI>Ba|nians,</HI> there is nothing but Flower, Rice, Herbs and Milk-meats to be had.</P>
<P>The great heats in <HI>India</HI> enforcing the Travellers, that are not accu&s;tomed to them, to travel by night, and re&s;t in the day-time; when they come into any fortified Towns, they mu&s;t be gone&punc;before Sun-&s;et, if they intend to travel that night. For night coming on, and the Gates being &s;hut, the Commander of the place, who is to an&s;wer for all the Robberies that are committed within his Ju|ri&s;diction, will let no per&s;on &s;tir forth, telling them that it is the King's order, to which he mu&s;t be obedient. When I came to any of tho&s;e Towns, I brought my Provi&s;ions, and went out again in good time, and &s;taid in the Field under &s;ome Tree, in the fre&s;h air, till it was time to &s;et forward.</P>

<P><HI>Brampour</HI> is a great City, very much ruin'd, the Hou&s;es being for the mo&s;t part thatch'd with &s;traw. There is al&s;o a great Ca&s;tle in the mid&s;t of the City, where the Governour lies; the Government of this Province is a very con&s;idera|ble command; and is only conferr'd upon the Son or Unckle of the King. And <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> the pre&s;ent King, was a long time Governour of this Province in the Reign of his Father. But &s;ince they came to under&s;tand the &s;trength of the Pro|vince of <HI>Bengala,</HI> which formerly bore the Title of a Kingdom, that Province is now the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Countrey. There is a great Trade in this City, and as well in <HI>Brampore,</HI> as over all the Province, there is made a prodigious quantity of Calicuts very clear and white, which are tran&s;ported into <HI>Per&s;ia, Turkey</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covia, Poland, Arabia,</HI> to <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> and other places. There are &s;ome which are painted with &s;everal colours, with flowers, of which the Women make Veils and Scarfs; the &s;ame Calicuts &s;erve for Coverlets of Beds, and for Handkerchiefs. There is another &s;ort of Linnen which they never dye, with a &s;tripe or two of Gold or Silver quite through the piece, and at each end from the breadth of one inch to twelve or fifteen, in &s;ome more, in &s;ome le&s;s, they fix a ti&s;&s;ue of Gold, Silver, and Silk, intermix'd with Flowers, whereof there is no wrong-&s;ide, both &s;ides being as fair the one as the other. If the&s;e pieces, which they carry into <HI>Poland,</HI> where they have a va&s;t utterance, want at each end three or four inches at the lea&s;t of Gold or Silver; or if that Gold or Silver become tarni&s;h'd in being carried by Sea from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> and from <HI>Trebizan</HI> to <HI>Mangala,</HI> or any other part upon the Black-Sea, the Merchant &s;hall have much ado to put them off without great lo&s;s. He mu&s;t take care that his goods be packt up in good Bales, that no wet may get in; which for &s;o long a Voyage requires great care and trouble. Some of the&s;e Linnens are made purpo&s;ely for Swathbands or Sha&s;hes, and tho&s;e pieces are call'd <HI>Ornis.</HI> They contain from 15 to 20 Ells; and co&s;t from an hundred to an hundred and fifty Roupies, the lea&s;t, not being under ten or twelve ells. Tho&s;e that are not above two ells long are worn by the Ladies of Quality for Veils and Scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, of which there is a va&s;t quantity ven|ded in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey.</HI> They make at <HI>Brampour</HI> al&s;o other &s;orts of Cotten-Linnen; for indeed there is no Province in all the <HI>Indies</HI> which more abounds in Cotton.</P>
<P>When you leave the City of <HI>Brampoure,</HI> you mu&s;t pa&s;s another River, be&s;ides that which I have mention'd already. There is no Bridge, and therefore when the water is low, you ford it; when the rains fall, there are Boats attending.</P>
<P>From <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Brampour</HI> it is 132 Co&s;tes; and the&s;e Co&s;tes are very &s;hort in the <HI>Indies;</HI> for you may travel one of them in a Coach in le&s;s than an hour.</P>
<P>I remember a &s;trange tumult at <HI>Brampoure,</HI> in the year 1641, when I re|turned from <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Surat;</HI> the cau&s;e whereof was thus, in &s;hort: The Governour of the Province, who was the King's Nephew by the Mother's-&s;ide, had among his Pages a young Boy that was very beautiful, and of a very good Family, who had a Brother in the City that liv'd as a <HI>Dervich;</HI> and for whom
<PB N="32" REF="173">
all the Town had a very great veneration. One day the Governour, being alone in his Chamber, did all that lay in his power, by vertue of Gifts and Care&s;&s;es to have had the u&s;e of his Body; but the Boy dete&s;ting his abominable purpo&s;e, made his e&s;cape from him, and came and told his Brother. The <HI>Dervich,</HI> without deliberating what Coun&s;el he had to give his younger Brother, gave him a Sword, &s;uch a one as he might ea&s;ily hide under his Garment; and told him, that if the Governour urg'd him any more, that he &s;hould make a &s;hew of complying with him, but that when he went about to do the fact, he &s;hould be &s;ure to run him into the Guts. The Governour, who knew nothing of what the Page had reveal'd to his Brother, ceas'd not every day to court him to con&s;ent to his infamous lu&s;t; and being one day alone with him in a &s;mall Apartment of a Banquetting-Hou&s;e, at the lower end of his Garden, he &s;ent for his Page to fan him, and to keep off the Flies, after the fa&s;hion of the Countrey; for it was about noon, when every one goes to &s;leep. Then did the Governour begin again to pre&s;s the young Page; and finding that he made no re&s;i&s;tance, he thought he &s;hould &s;uddenly accompli&s;h his de&s;ign. But the Page &s;eeing him ready to commit the act, &s;tab'd him three times into the Belly, before he could open his mouth to cry out for help. That done, the Page went out of the Palace, without any di&s;turbance in his countenance; &s;o that the Guards believ'd that the Governour had &s;ent him out upon &s;ome errand. The <HI>Der|vich</HI> under&s;tanding by his Brother what had pa&s;s'd, to &s;ave him from the fury of the people, and to di&s;cover the Infamy of the Governour, caus'd the re&s;t of the <HI>Dervichs</HI> his Companions, to take the Banners of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that were planted round the <HI>Mo&s;quee;</HI> and at the &s;ame time with loud cries encourag'd all the re&s;t of the <HI>Dervichs, Faquirs,</HI> and others that were good <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> to follow him. In le&s;s than an hours time he had got together an infinite multitude of the Rabble, and the <HI>Dervich</HI> marching at the head of them, they made directly to the Palace, crying out with all their might, <HI>Let us dye for</HI> Mahomet, <HI>or let us have that infamous per&s;on deliver'd up into our hands, to the end the Dogs may eat him after his death, not being worthy to be enterr'd among the Mu&s;&s;elmen.</HI> The Guard of the Palace was not in a condition to re&s;i&s;t &s;o great a Multitude, &s;o that they mu&s;t have been forced to have yeilded to their fury; had not the <HI>Deroga</HI> of the Town, and &s;ome five or &s;ix Lords, found a way to make them&s;elves to be heard, and to appea&s;e them, by repre&s;enting to them, that they ought to have &s;ome re&s;pect to the Nephew of the King; by that means obliging them to retire. That night the Body of the Governour was &s;ent to <HI>Agra,</HI> with his <HI>Haram;</HI> and <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> who then reign'd, being inform'd of the accident, was not much troubl'd, becau&s;e he is Heir to all the goods of his Subjects; and at the &s;ame time he be&s;tow'd upon the Page a &s;mall Government in the Province of <HI>Bengala.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Seronge</HI> is a great City, the mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants whereof are <HI>Banian</HI> Merchants, and Handicraft-trades-men from Father to Son, which is the rea&s;on that there are in this City &s;everal Hou&s;es of Stone and Brick. There is al&s;o a great Trade for all &s;orts of painted Calicuts, which are called <HI>Chites,</HI> which is the cloathing of all the meaner &s;ort of people both in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey:</HI> Of which in other Countreys al&s;o they make u&s;e, for Coverlets for Beds, and Table-napkins. They make the &s;ame &s;ort of Calicuts in other Countreys as well as at <HI>Seronge,</HI> but the colours are not &s;o lively; be&s;ides, that they wear out with often wa&s;h|ing. Whereas tho&s;e that are made at <HI>Seronge,</HI> the more you wa&s;h them, the fairer the colours &s;hew. There runs a River by the City, the water whereof has that vertue, that it gives that beauty and liveline&s;s to the colours. And all the while the rains fall, the Workmen will make the&s;e prints upon their Cottons, ac|cording to the Patterns which the Forreign Merchants give them; for when the waters are ceas'd, the water is the thicker; and the oftener they dip their Cali|cuts, the better the colours hold.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o made at <HI>Seronge</HI> another &s;ort of Calicut, which is &s;o fine, that when a man puts it on, his skin &s;hall appear through it, as if he were naked. The Mer|chants are not permitted to tran&s;port it. For the Governour &s;ends it all to the <HI>Se|raglio</HI> of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and to the principal Lords of the Court. Of this, the Sultane&s;&s;es, and great Noblemen's Wives make them Shifts and Garments in hot-weather: And the King and the Lords take great plea&s;ure to behold them in tho&s;e Shifts, and to &s;ee them Dance with nothing el&s;e upon their Bodies.</P>

by 24 Yoke of Oxen. A very &s;trong Elephant follow'd the Artillery, and when they came to any bad-way, where the Oxen were at a &s;tand, they brought up the Elephant, who heav'd the Cannon forward with his Trunk. Without the Town, all along the high-way, there grows a va&s;t number of great Trees, which they call <HI>Mangues;</HI> and in many places near the Trees are to be &s;een little Pagods, with every one an Idol at the door.

Some thought that the Governour of the Elephant had taught him what to do, and made &s;igns to him, which however I did not ob&s;erve; neverthele&s;s the <HI>Banians</HI> were very much offended, though they dur&s;t not &s;ay any thing; for there was a Guard of above two thou&s;and men that convoy'd the Artillery, all Souldiers of the King, and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Franguis,</HI> or <HI>Franks, Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> that were Cannoneers.

<P><HI>Gate</HI> is a &s;trait pa&s;&s;age of the Mountains, a quarter of a League in length, the de&s;cent whereof leads from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Agra.</HI> At the entery thereof you &s;ee the ruins of two or three Ca&s;tles, and the Road is &s;o narrow, that two Waggons can hardly go a bre&s;t.

In my la&s;t Travels I &s;taid at one of the&s;e Shops, to tarry for the Coaches and Waggons, all the Pa&s;&s;engers alighting at the foot of the Streights. Not far off there is a great Magazin full of &s;acks of Rice and Corn; and behind every &s;ack lay a Serpent thirteen or fourteen foot long, and proportionable in bigne&s;s. A Woman&punc;that went to fetch Corn out of one of tho&s;e &s;acks, was bitten by one of tho&s;e Serpents, and perceiving her &s;elf wounded, ran out of the Magazin, crying out <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> that is, <HI>O God, O God;</HI> whereupon &s;everal <HI>Banians,</HI> men and women came running to her relief, and bound her arm very hard above the wound, thinking to &s;top the venom from run|ning any higher. But all in vain, for immediately her face &s;well'd and turn'd black, and &s;he dy'd in le&s;s than an hour. The <HI>Ragipou's,</HI> who are the be&s;t Souldiers among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and are all Idolaters, came in ju&s;t as the woman was expiring, and about four of them entring with their Skains, and Half-pikes in their hands into the Magaziu, kill'd the Serpent. The people of the Village took and threw it without the Town, and immediately there came a great number of Birds of prey, which lighting upon the Carrion, devour'd it in le&s;s than an hours time. The Pa|rents of the woman took her body, carri'd it to the River, wa&s;h'd it, and then burnt it. I was forc'd to &s;tay two days at that place, becau&s;e there was a River to pa&s;s, which in&s;tead of falling, &s;well'd at that time, by rea&s;on of the rains that fell for three or four days together: So that I was con&s;train'd to go half a league lower before I could cro&s;s it. They always endeavour'd to ford this River; for otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t be compell'd to unload the Wgagon into the Boats; and al&s;o to carry the Goods in their arms for above half a league, which is wor&s;e way than can be imagin'd. The people get their livings by the Pa&s;&s;engers, from whom they extort as much as they can, there being none but they that know the ways: Otherwi&s;e it would be an ea&s;y thing to make a Bridge, there being no want either of Wood or Stone near at hand. For the pa&s;&s;age is nothing but thorough Rocks, that lie between the Mountain and the River; &s;o that the waters when they &s;well, overflow all the Road, in-&s;o-much that no-body can pa&s;s it, but they who are very well acquainted with it.</P>

<P>Since the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Kings became Ma&s;ters of this Countrey, this Fortre&s;s of <HI>Goualeor</HI> is the place where they &s;ecure Princes and great Noblemen. <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> coming to the Empire by foul-play, caus'd all the Princes and Lords whom he mi&s;tru&s;ted, to be &s;eiz'd one after another, and &s;ent them to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Goua|leor;</HI> but he &s;uffer'd them all to live, and enjoy their E&s;tates. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> his Son acts quite otherwi&s;e; For when he &s;ends any great Lord to this place, at the end of nine or ten days he orders him to be poi&s;on'd; and this he does that the peo|ple may not exclaim again&s;t him for a bloody Prince. So &s;oon as he had in his clutches Prince <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> his younge&s;t Brother, whom he engaged to take Arms again&s;t his Father <HI>Cha-jehan;</HI> and who being Governor of the Province of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> took upon him the Title of King, he &s;ent him to this Fortre&s;s, where he dy'd. They have made him a mo&s;t magnificent Monument in the City in a <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which they built on Purpo&s;e, with a great <HI>Piazza</HI> before it all &s;ur|rounded with Vaults and Shops over them. For it is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they rear any publick building, to make a great <HI>Piazza</HI> before it, where they keep their Markets, with a Foundation for the Poor, to whom they give Alms every day, as being to pray to God for him that rais'd the Fabrick.</P>

<P>All the Countrey between the&s;e two Cities is full of Corn, Rice, Millet, and Sugar-Canes. Before you enter into <HI>Baroche,</HI> you mu&s;t Ferry over the River which runs to <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and falls into the Golf that carries the &s;ame name.</P>
<P><HI>Baroche</HI> is a great City, to which there belongs a Fortre&s;s, of which there is no u&s;e made at this time. But the City has been always very famous, by rea&s;on of the River, which has a particular quality to whiten their Cottons; which are brought thither from all parts of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Territories, where they have not that convenience. In this place are made a great quantity of Baffa's, or long and large pieces of Cotton. The&s;e Cottons are very fair, and clo&s;e woven; and the price of the&s;e pieces is from four to an hundred Roupies. You mu&s;t pay Cu&s;tom at <HI>Baroche</HI> for all Goods that are brought in and carri'd out. The <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> have a very fair Hou&s;e in the City; and I remember once, that coming thi|ther one day in my return from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> with the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> pre&s;ently the Mountebanks came about him, and ask'd him if he would &s;ee any of their tricks. The fir&s;t thing they did was to light a great fire, and to heat cer|tain Iron-chains red-hot, and wind them about their bodies, making as if they felt a great deal of pain, but in truth receiving no harm at all. Then they thru&s;t a piece of a &s;tick into the ground, and ask'd the Company what Fruit they would have. One told them, he would have <HI>Mengues;</HI> then one of the Mountebanks hiding him&s;elf in the middle of a Sheet, &s;toopt to the ground five or &s;ix times one after another. I was &s;o curious to go up &s;tairs, and look out of a window, to &s;ee if I could &s;py what the Mountebank did; and perceived, that after he had cut him&s;elf under the armpits with a Razor, he rubb'd the &s;tick with his Blood. After the two fir&s;t times that he rais'd him&s;elf, the &s;tick &s;eem'd to the very eye to grow. The third time there &s;prung out branches with young buds. The fourth time the Tree was covered with leaves; and the fifth time it bore flowers. The Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had then his Mini&s;ter with him, having brought him from <HI>Amadabat</HI> to Chri&s;ten the Commander of the <HI>Hollander</HI>'s Child, to which he had promi&s;ed to be Godfather. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter Prote&s;ted that he could not give his con&s;ent that any Chri&s;tian &s;hould be a &s;pectator of &s;uch delu&s;ions. So that as &s;oon as he &s;aw that tho&s;e Mountebanks had of a dry-&s;tick, in le&s;s then half an hour, made a Tree four or five foot high, that bare leaves and flowers as in the Spring-time; he went about to break it, prote&s;ting he would not give the Com|munion to any per&s;on that &s;hould &s;tay any longer to &s;ee tho&s;e things. Thereupon the Pre&s;ident was forc'd to di&s;mi&s;s the Mountebanks, who wander about the Countrey with their Wives and Children ju&s;t like Gip&s;ies; and having given them to the value of ten or twelve Crowns, they went away very well con|tented.</P>
<P>They that are curious to &s;ee <HI>Cambaya,</HI> never go out of their way above five or &s;ix Co&s;tes, or thereabout. For when you are at <HI>Baroche,</HI> in&s;tead of going to <HI>Broudra,</HI> you may go directly forward to <HI>Cambaya,</HI> from thence after|wards to <HI>Amadabat.</HI> But whether it be for bu&s;ine&s;s, or out of curio&s;ity, the lat|ter Road is never to be taken; not only becau&s;e it is the longe&s;t way, but be|cau&s;e of the danger in cro&s;&s;ing the mouth of the Golf.</P>
<P><HI>Cambaya</HI> is a great City at the bottom of the Golf that bears its name. Here it is that they &s;hape tho&s;e fair <HI>Agats,</HI> that come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> into Cups, Hafts of Knives, Beads, and other &s;orts of Workman&s;hip. In the parts adjacent to the City, they al&s;o make <HI>Indigo</HI> of the &s;ame nature of that of

<HI>Sarque&s;s;</HI> and it was famous for traffick at the time when the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> flou|ri&s;h'd in <HI>India.</HI> There are to be &s;een at this day, in the Quarter next the Sea, very fair Hou&s;es, which they had built, with very rich Furniture, after the <HI>Portugal</HI> manner; but now they are uninhabited, and fall to decay every day more and more. There were then &s;uch good Orders ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Cambaya,</HI> that two hours after day was &s;hut in, every Street was lock't up with two Gates, which are &s;till to be &s;een; and &s;till they continue to lock up the prin|cipal Streets, as al&s;o the Streets that lead into the Town. One of the chief rea&s;ons why the Town has lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of its Trade is, becau&s;e that formerly the Sea run clo&s;e up to <HI>Cambaya,</HI> &s;o that little Ve&s;&s;els ea&s;ily anchor'd by it; but afterwards the Sea daily lo&s;t in that part, &s;o that a &s;mall Ship could not ride within five or &s;ix Leagues of the City.</P>
<P>There are a great number of Peacocks in the <HI>Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Ter|ritories of <HI>Baroche, Cambaya,</HI> and <HI>Broudra.</HI> The fle&s;h of the young ones is white and well-ta&s;ted like ours, and you &s;hall &s;ee va&s;t numbers of them all day in the Fields, for at night they roo&s;t upon the Trees. 'Tis a hard mat|ter to come near them in the day, for as &s;oon as they perceive them&s;elves hunted, they fly away as &s;wift as a Partridg among the Bu&s;hes; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to follow them without tearing his Cloaths all to rags; therefore are they only to be taken in the night time, to which purpo&s;e they have this invention. They approach the Tree with a kind of a Banner, upon which there is a Peacock painted to the life on both &s;ides; at the top of the &s;tick are fa&s;tn'd two lighted Candles, the brightne&s;s whereof amazing the Pea|cock, cau&s;es him to &s;tretch out his Neck toward the end of the &s;tick, to which there is a Rope ty'd with a &s;liding knot, which he that holds the Banner draws, when he finds that the Peacock has put his Neck into it. But you mu&s;t have a care of killing either Bird or any other Animal in the Territories, of which the idolatrous <HI>Rajah's</HI> are Ma&s;ters; which is nothing dangerous to do in tho&s;e parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> where the Governors are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and give liberty to Fowl or Hunt. It happen'd one time that a rich <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant, pa&s;|&s;ing through the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Dantivar,</HI> &s;hot a Peacock upon the road, and kill'd it, either out of ra&s;hne&s;s, or ignorance of the Cu&s;toms of the Country. The <HI>Bannians</HI> incens'd at the attempt, which is accounted among them a mo&s;t abominable &s;acriledg, &s;eiz'd upon the Merchant, and all his Mo|ney to the value of 300000. Roupies, and tying him to a Tree, whipt him in &s;o terrible a manner for three days together, that the Man dy'd.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cambaya</HI> you go to a little Village di&s;tant &s;ome three Co&s;tes, where there is a Pagod, to which all the <HI>Indian</HI> Curti&s;ans come to make their Of|ferings. This Pagod is full of a great number of naked Images, among the re&s;t, there is a large Figure of one that &s;eems to re&s;emble <HI>Apollo,</HI> with his privy parts all uncover'd. When the old Curti&s;ans have got together a good &s;um of Money in their youth, they buy young Slaves, whom they teach to Daunce, and &s;ing wanton Songs, and in&s;truct in all the my&s;teries of their in|famous Art. And when the&s;e young Girls are eleven or twelve years old, their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;end them to this Pagod, believing it will bring them good for|tune, to offer and &s;urrender up them&s;elves to this Idol.</P>

<HI>Indigo,</HI> which is made at a great Town, not far from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> called <HI>Sarque&s;s.</HI> There was in that place a <HI>Pagod,</HI> which the <HI>Mahumetan's</HI> have pull'd down, and built a <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> in the place. Before you enter into it, you mu&s;t cro&s;s three large Courts pav'd with Marble, and encompa&s;t with Galleries; nor mu&s;t you enter into the third Court till you have pull'd off your &s;hooes. The in&s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> is adorn'd with <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI>-work, the greate&s;t part whereof is of <HI>Agats</HI> of divers colours, which they fetch from the Mountains of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> not above two days journey off. There are &s;everal Sepulchres of the ancient Idolatrous Kings, that look like little Chappels, of <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI>-work, built upon a Vault that is under the Se|pulchre. There runs a River from <HI>Amadabat</HI> toward the North-we&s;t, which du|ring the rainy-&s;ea&s;ons that continue three or four Months together, is very wide and rapid, and does much mi&s;chief every year. It is &s;o with all the other Rivers in <HI>India;</HI> and after the rains are fallen, you mu&s;t &s;tay &s;ix weeks or two months before you can ford <HI>Amadabat</HI>-River, where there is no Bridg. There are two or three Boats; but they are of no u&s;e, when the &s;tream is &s;o &s;wift; &s;o that you mu&s;t &s;tay till the waters are fall'n. But the people of the Countrey will not &s;tay &s;o long; for to cro&s;s from one River to another, they only make u&s;e of Goat|skins, which they blow up and fill with wind, and then tye them between their &s;to|macks and their bellies. Thus the poor men and women &s;wim cro&s;s this River, and when they would carry their children along with them, they put them in certain round pots of Earth, the mouth whereof is four fingers wide, and drive the Pots before them. This puts me in mind of a Pa&s;&s;age, when I was at <HI>Ama|dabat</HI> in the year 1642, which is too remarkable to be omitted.</P>
<P>A Countrey-man and a Countrey-woman one day pa&s;t the River as I have rela|ted, and having a child about two years old, they put it into one of the&s;e Pots, &s;o that there was nothing but the head appear'd. Being about the middle of the River, they met with a little bank of Sand, where there lay an huge Tree, which the &s;tream had carry'd thither; whereupon the Father &s;hov'd the Pot toward that part, to re&s;t him&s;elf awhile. When he came near the Tree, the trunk whereof lay &s;omewhat above the water, a Serpent leapt out from among the roots, into the Pot where the Infant was. The Father and the Mother frighted at the acci|dent, and having almo&s;t lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es, let the Pot go a-drift where the &s;tream carri'd it, and lay almo&s;t dead them&s;elves at the bottom of the Tree. About two leagues lower, a <HI>Banian</HI> and his Wife with a little Infant, were wa&s;hing them&s;elves in the River before they went to eat. They de&s;cry'd the Pot a-far-off, with the half of the Infant's-head that appear'd above the hole. The <HI>Banian</HI> immediately &s;wims to the relief of the child, and having &s;topp'd the Pot, drives it to the &s;hoar. The Mother follow'd by her own, comes pre&s;ently to take the other child out of the Pot, at what time the Serpent that had done no harm to the other child, &s;hoots out of the Pot, and winding about hers, &s;tings it, and infu&s;es its venom in|to the Infant, &s;o that it dy'd immediately. However, the accident being &s;o ex|traordinary, did not trouble the&s;e poor people; who rather believ'd it to have happen'd by the &s;ecret di&s;po&s;al of their Deity, who had taken from them one child, to give them another for it, with which opinion they pre&s;ently comforted them&s;elves. Some time after, the report of this accident coming to the ears of the fir&s;t Country-man, he comes to the <HI>Banian</HI> to tell him how the mi&s;chance had happen'd, and to demand his child of him; the other <HI>Indian</HI> affirming that the child was his, and that his God had &s;ent it him, in the place of that which was dead. To be &s;hort, the bu&s;ine&s;s made &s;o loud a noi&s;e, that it was at length brought before the King, who order'd, that the child &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to the Father.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time there happen'd another very plea&s;ant accident in the &s;ame City of <HI>Amadabat.</HI> The Wife of a rich Merchant <HI>Banian,</HI> nam'd <HI>Saintidas,</HI> ne|ver having had a child, and manife&s;ting her eager de&s;ire to have one, a &s;ervant of the Hou&s;e took her a-&s;ide one day, and told her, that if &s;he would but eat that which he would give her, &s;he &s;hould be with child. The woman de&s;irous to know what &s;he was to eat, the &s;ervant told her it was a little fi&s;h, and that &s;he &s;hould eat but three or four. Now the Religion of the <HI>Banians</HI> forbidding them to eat any thing that has life, &s;he could not at fir&s;t re&s;olve to yield to his propo&s;al; but the &s;ervant having promi&s;ed her that he would &s;o order the matter, that &s;he
<PB N="39" REF="176">
&s;hould not know whether it were fi&s;h or no that &s;he eat, &s;he re&s;olv'd to try his receit, and went the next night to lie with her Husband, according to the in|&s;truction which &s;he had received from the Servant. Some time after, the woman perceiving that &s;he was big, her Husband happen'd to die, and the kindred of the decea&s;ed would have his E&s;tate. The Widow oppo&s;ed them, and told them that it behov'd them to &s;tay, till they &s;aw whether the Child &s;he went withal, would live or no. Her kindred were &s;urpriz'd to hear &s;uch news that they &s;o little ex|pected, and tax'd her for one that either ly'd or je&s;ted with them; knowing that the woman had liv'd fifteen or &s;ixteen years with her Husband, yet never had been with Child. Seeing therefore that her kindred &s;till tormented her, &s;he went and threw her &s;elf at the Governour's feet, to whom &s;he related all that had pa&s;t; who thereupon order'd that the kindred &s;hould &s;tay till the woman was deliver'd. Some days after &s;he had lain-in, the kindred of the deceas'd Merchant, who were Per&s;ons of Credit, and gap'd after &s;o fair an inheritance, affirm'd that the child was not Legitimate, and that &s;he had it not by her Husband. The Gover|nour, to under&s;tand the truth of the matter, calls for the Phy&s;icians; who con|cluded, that the Infant &s;hould be carried to the <HI>Bath,</HI> &s;aying, that if the Receit which the Mother had made u&s;e of, were real, the &s;weat of the Child would &s;mell of Fi&s;h; which was done accordingly, and the Experiment prov'd true. Thereupon the Governour order'd that the Child &s;hould have the E&s;tate, the Merchant being &s;o proud to be his Father: But the kindred, troubl'd that &s;uch a fat Mor&s;el had e&s;cap'd their mouths, appeal'd to the King. Upon their relation of the &s;tory, the King wrote to the Governour to &s;end him the Mother and the In|fant, to the end the Experiment might be made in his pre&s;ence: which having the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as before, the kindred &s;urceas'd their claim, and the E&s;tate re|main'd re|main'd to the Mother and the Infant.</P>
<P>I remember al&s;o another plea&s;ant Story which was related to me at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where I have been ten or twelve times. A Merchant with whom I often dealt, and who was very well belov'd by <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> Governour of the Province, and the King's Uncle, had the reputation never to have told a lye. <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> after the three years of his Government were expir'd, according to the cu&s;tom of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and that <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> the King's Son was come into his place, retir'd to <HI>Agra,</HI> where the Court then was. One day, di&s;cour&s;ing with the King, he told him, that he had &s;een many rare things in the Government, with which his Maje&s;ty had honour'd him, but that one thing above all the re&s;t had a&s;toni&s;h'd him, to have met with a Rich Merchant that had never told a lye, and yet he was above three&s;core and ten years of age. The King &s;urpriz'd at a thing &s;o ex|traordinary, &s;ignified to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> his de&s;ire to &s;ee the per&s;on, and commanded him to &s;end for him to <HI>Agra,</HI> which he did. The Old-Man was very much troubl'd, as well in regard of the length of the way, it being a journey of 25 or 30 days, as for that he was to make a Pre&s;ent to the King. In &s;hort, he provided one, e&s;teem'd at fourty-thou&s;and Roupies, to carry <HI>Betl&eacute;</HI> in, enchas'd with Dia|monds, Rubies, and Emraulds. When he had made his obey&s;ance to the King, and given him his Pre&s;ent, the King ask'd him only what was his name, to whom he replyed, that he was call'd the man that had never told a lye. Then the King ask'd him who was his Father? Sir, &s;aid he, I cannot tell; his Maje&s;ty &s;atisfi'd with an an&s;wer, &s;topt there, and unwilling to trouble him any farther, comman|ded an Elephant to be given him, which is a very great Honour, and ten thou|&s;and Roupies to bear his charges home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banians</HI> have a great Veneration for Apes, and there are &s;ome which they breed up in their Pagods to wor&s;hip. There are three or four Hou&s;es in <HI>Amad|abat</HI> which they make u&s;e of for Ho&s;pitals for Cowes, Oxen, Apes, and other &s;ick or maim'd Bea&s;ts; and they carry all they can find thither to pre&s;erve them. This is al&s;o very remarkable, that every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> all the Apes in the places adjoyning to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> of their own accord come to the City, and get upon the tops of their Hou&s;es, where they lye, during the exce&s;&s;ive heats. And therefore upon tho&s;e days the People never fail to &s;et ready in their Terra&s;|&s;es, Rice, Millet, Sugar-Canes in their &s;ea&s;ons, and other &s;uch-like things. For if the Apes did not find their provi&s;ion when they came, they would break the Tiles where-with the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e is cover'd, and do a great deal of mi&s;|chief.
<PB N="40" REF="177">
And you mu&s;t here take notice al&s;o, that the Ape never eats any thing which he does not very well like the &s;cent of before-hand; and before he &s;wal|lows any-thing, he lays up his Magazin again&s;t future hunger; filling his bags with provi&s;ion, which he keeps till next day.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the <HI>Banians</HI> have a particular Veneration for the Ape; of which I will give you one Example, among many, that I could bring. Being one day at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> at the Hou&s;e belonging to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> a young man of that Nation newly arriv'd to &s;erve in the Factory, not knowing the cu&s;tom of the Countrey, and &s;eeing a great Ape upon a Tree in the Court, would needs &s;hew a piece of activity, or rather a trick of youth, to kill the Ape with a &s;mall Gun. I was at the Table then with the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Commander; and we no &s;ooner heard the blow, but we heard as &s;oon a loud noi&s;e of <HI>Banians,</HI> that wait upon the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, who came to complain bitterly of him that had kill'd the Ape. They would all have been gone; &s;o that the Commander had much ado, and made many excu&s;es before he could appea&s;e them, and oblige them to &s;tay.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood about <HI>Amadabat,</HI> there are a great number of Apes. And this is ob&s;ervable, that where there are a great number of tho&s;e Ani|mals, there are very few Crows. For as &s;oon as they have built their Ne&s;ts and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees and throw their Eggs to the Ground. One day returning from <HI>Agra,</HI> and departing out of <HI>Amada|bat</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, who came hither about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and was returning to <HI>Surat,</HI> we pa&s;s'd through a little Forre&s;t of Trees, call'd <HI>Mangues,</HI> &s;ome four or five Leagues from <HI>Amadabat;</HI> there we &s;aw a va&s;t number of great Monkeys, male and female, and many of their females holding their young ones in their Arms. We had each of us our Coach, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;i|dent cau&s;ing his to &s;top, told me he had an excellent and very neat Harque|bu&s;s, that was pre&s;ented him by the Governor of <HI>Daman,</HI> and knowing I could aim well, he de&s;ir'd me to try it, at one of tho&s;e Apes. One of my Servants, who was born in the Country, making me a &s;ign not to venture, I endeavoured to di&s;&s;wade the Pre&s;ident from his de&s;ign; but it was impo&s;|&s;ible; &s;o that I took the Harquebu&s;s, and kill'd a female Monkey, who lay &s;tretch'd out upon the Boughs, letting her little ones fall to the ground. But it fell out as my Servant had forewarn'd me. For immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of &s;ixty, came down in a great fury, to have leap'd into the Pre&s;idents Coach, where they would &s;oon have &s;trangled him, had we not prevented them by clo&s;ing the Shutters, and had we not had a great number of Servants, that which much ado kept them off. And though they came not to my Coach, yet I was very much afraid of my &s;elf; for they pur&s;ued the Pre&s;ident's Coach above a League, and they were &s;tout lu&s;ty Monkeys.</P>

<P><HI>Chitpour</HI> is a very good City, &s;o called by rea&s;on of the great Trade for painted-Calicuts, which are called <HI>Chites:</HI> Near which, &s;ome four or five-hundred paces toward the South, there runs a &s;mall River. Arriving at <HI>Chitpour</HI> in one of my Voyages, I pitch'd my Tent under two or three Trees at the end of a wide-place neer the Town. A little while after I &s;aw four or five Lions appear, which were brought to be tam'd; which they told me took them up five or &s;ix months; and their way to do it, is this: They tye the Lions at twelve paces di&s;tance one from another by the hinder-legs, with a Rope fa&s;ten'd to a great woodden-&s;take &s;et deep in the ground, with another cord about the neck, which the Ma&s;ter holds in his hand. The&s;e &s;takes are planted in the &s;ame Line, and in another Parallel they &s;tretch out another Cord as long as the &s;pace, which the bodies of the Lions &s;o di&s;pos'd of, as I have de&s;crib'd, take up. The two Cords which hold the Lion ty'd by the two hinder-feet, give him liberty to &s;pring out as far as that long Cord; which is a mark to tho&s;e that &s;tand to provoke and incen&s;e the Lions, by throwing &s;tones and pieces of wood at them, not to venture any farther: The people run to &s;ee the &s;ight, and when the Lion, provok'd, gives a &s;pring towards the Cord, the Ma&s;ter
<PB N="41" REF="177">
holds another in his hand, ty'd about his neck, that pulls him back. Thus they accu&s;tom the Lion by degrees to be familiar with the people, and at my coming to <HI>Chiapour,</HI> I &s;aw this Diverti&s;ement without &s;tirring out of my Coach.</P>
<P>The next day I had another, meeting with a knot of <HI>Faquirs,</HI> or <HI>Mahometan Dervichs.</HI> I counted fifty-&s;even, among whom, he that was the Chief or Supe|rior, had been Grand E&s;quire to <HI>Cha-jehan-guir,</HI> having left the Court, when <HI>Sultan Boulaki,</HI> his younge&s;t Son, was &s;trangl'd by Order of <HI>Cha-jehan;</HI> there were four others, who next to the Superior, were chief of the Company, who had been al&s;o great Lords in the &s;ame <HI>Cha-jehan</HI>'s Court. All the Cloaths tho&s;e five <HI>Dervichs</HI> had, were only four ells of Orange-colour-Calicut to hide what mode&s;ty will have hid before and behind, and every one of them a Tygers-skin over their &s;houlders ty'd together under their chins. They had led before them eight fair Hor&s;es-&s;addl'd and bridl'd; three whereof had Bridles of Gold, and Saddles cover'd with Plates of Gold, and the other five had Bridles of Silver cover'd with Plates of Silver, and a Leopard's-skin upon every one. The other <HI>Dervichs</HI> had only a Cord for their Girdle, to which was fa&s;ten'd a piece of Cali|cut only to cover their private parts. Their hair was ty'd in wreaths round about their heads after the manner of a Turbant. They were all well-arm'd, the mo&s;t part with Bows and Arrows, &s;ome with Muskets, and others with Half-pikes, with another &s;ort of weapon which we have not in <HI>Europe;</HI> that is to &s;ay, a &s;harp piece of Iron like the &s;ide of a Platter without a bottom, which they wind eight or ten times about their necks, and carry like a Calves Chaldron. They draw out the&s;e Iron-Circles as they intend to make u&s;e of them; and they will throw them with &s;uch a force again&s;t a man, that they &s;hall &s;&s;y as &s;wift as an Arrow, and go very neer to cut a man in two in the middle. They had every one, be&s;ides all this, an Hunting-Horn, which they wind, making a prodigious noi&s;e when they come to any place, and when they go away; together with a Grater or Ra&s;p, being an Iron-In&s;tru|ment, made like a Trowel. This is an In&s;trument which the <HI>Indians</HI> carry gene|rally about them when they travel, to &s;crape and make clean the places where they intend to re&s;t; and &s;ome of them, when they have &s;crap'd all the du&s;t to|gether into an heap, make u&s;e of it in&s;tead of a Mattre&s;s or Pillow to lie ea&s;ily upon. There were &s;ome of them that were arm'd with long Tucks; which they had bought either of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Portugals.</HI> Their Luggage con&s;i&s;ted of four great Che&s;ts full of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Books, and &s;ome Kitchen-hou&s;hold&s;tuff: They had al&s;o ten or twelve Oxen to carry their &s;ick. When the <HI>Dervichs</HI> came to the place where I lay with my Coach, having about fifty per&s;ons with me, as well of the people of the Countrey, as of my own &s;ervants; the Chief or Su|perior of the Troop &s;eeing me &s;o well-attended, enquir'd what <HI>Aga</HI> that was; and de&s;ir'd me to let him have that place which I had taken up, as being the mo&s;t convenient in all that place, for him and his <HI>Dervichs</HI> to lodg. When they told me the quality of the Chief, and the four <HI>Dervichs</HI> that attended him, I was wil|ling to be civil, and to yield to their reque&s;t; and thereupon I left them the place free. After they had well-water'd the place, and laid the du&s;t, they lighted two fires, as if it had been in the fro&s;t and &s;now for the five principal <HI>Dervichs,</HI> who &s;ate and cha&s;'d them&s;elves before and behind. That very evening, after they had &s;upp'd the Governour of the Town came to complement the principal <HI>Der|vichs,</HI> and during their &s;tay, &s;ent them Rice and other things, which they are ac|cu&s;tom'd to eat. When they come to any place, the Superior &s;ends &s;ome of his Crew a begging into the Towns and Villages, and what Alms they get, is pre|&s;ently di&s;tributed equally among them; every one of them taking care to boil his own Rice. What is over and above they give to the Poor in the evening; for they re&s;erve nothing till next day.</P>

<P><HI>Bargant</HI> is in the Territories of a <HI>Raja,</HI> to whom you pay duties. In one of my journeys to <HI>Agra,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Bargant,</HI> I did not &s;ee the <HI>Raja,</HI> but only his Lieutenant, who was very civil to me, and made me a Pre&s;ent of Rice, Butter, and Fruit in &s;ea&s;on. To make him amends, I gave him three Sha&s;hes of Gold
<PB N="42" REF="178">
and Silk, four Handkerchiefs of painted Linnen, and two Bottles, the one full of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and the other full of <HI>Spani&s;h&punc;</HI> Wine. At my departure he &s;ent a Con|voy of twenty Hor&s;e four or five leagues along with me.</P>
<P>One evening being about to lodg upon the Frontiers of the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Bargant,</HI> my people came to me and told me, that if we took the Road through <HI>Bargant,</HI> we &s;hould go neer to have all our throats cut, for that the <HI>Raja</HI> of that place liv'd altogether upon Robbery. So that unle&s;s I hir'd an hundred more of the Country-people, there was no likelihood of e&s;caping tho&s;e Free|booters. At fir&s;t I argu'd with them, and tax'd their Cowardice, but fearing to pay for my ra&s;hne&s;s afterwards, I &s;ent them to hire fifty more, for three days only, that we cro&s;s'd the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Country: for which they ask'd me every one four Roupies, which is as much as you give them for a whole Month. The next day as I was about to &s;et forward, my Guard came and told me they would leave me, and that they would not venture their lives, de&s;iring me not to write to <HI>Agra</HI> to their Captain, who was re&s;pon&s;ible for them, that they had left me again&s;t my will. Three of my &s;ervants al&s;o did as they did, &s;o that I had no body left with me, but a man that lead an Hor&s;e in his hand, my Coachman, and three other &s;er|vants, and &s;o I &s;et forward under the protection of God. About a league from the place which I had left, I perceived &s;ome part of my Convoy following me. Thereupon I &s;topt my Coach to &s;tay for them, and when they came neer, I bid them advance if they intended to go along with me. But &s;eeing them fearful, and unre&s;olv'd, I bid them go about their bu&s;ine&s;s, telling them I had no need of &s;uch Cowards as they were. About a league from thence I di&s;cover'd upon the brow of an Hill about fifty Hor&s;e, four of which came riding up to me; when I perceived them, I alighted out of my Coach, and having with me &s;ome thirteen Spit-fires, I gave to every one of my men an Harquebu&s;s. The Hor&s;e-men ap|proaching, I kept my Coach between them and me, and had my Gun ready cockt, in ca&s;e they &s;hould a&s;&s;ail me. But they made me a &s;ign, that I &s;hould fear nothing; only that the Prince was a-Hunting, and had &s;ent to know what Strangers pa&s;t through his Territories: I made an&s;wer, that I was the &s;ame <HI>Franguy</HI> that had pa&s;t by five or &s;ix weeks before. By good luck, the very &s;ame Lieutenant to whom I had made the Pre&s;ent of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Wine, follow'd tho&s;e four Hor&s;emen.&punc; And after he had te&s;tify'd how glad he was to &s;ee me, he ask'd me if I had any Wine; I told him I never travell'd without that: For indeed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> had pre&s;ented me with &s;everal Bottles at <HI>Agra.</HI> So &s;oon as the Lieutenant was return'd to the <HI>Raja,</HI> the <HI>Raja</HI> him&s;elf came to me, and told me I was welcome; and bid me re&s;t my &s;elf in a &s;hady-place which he pointed to, about a league and an half from the place where we were. In the evening he came, and we &s;taid together two days to make merry; the <HI>Raja</HI> bring|ing alone with him certain Morrice-dancers, without which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>In|dians</HI> can never think them&s;elves heartily merry. At my departure the <HI>Raja</HI> lent me 200 Hor&s;e, to convoy me to the Frontiers of his Territories, for three days to|gether; for which I only gave them three or four pound of Tobacco. When I came to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> the people would hardly believe that I had had &s;o kind a re|ception from a Prince, that was noted for abu&s;ing &s;trangers that pa&s;t through his Countrey.</P>

<P>In all the&s;e forty <HI>Co&s;tes</HI> of way, there are but three pitiful Villages; where &s;ometimes, though very rarely, you have Bread and Barley for your Hor&s;es; but the &s;ure&s;t way is to carry provi&s;ion along with you. in the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> there blows a hot Wind in tho&s;e parts, that takes away a mans breath, and kills him upon the place; being of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e Winds, of which I have &s;poken in my <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Relations, that blow at certain &s;ea&s;ons near <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Mou&s;&s;ul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caboul</HI> is a large City, very well fortified; and is the place where tho&s;e of <HI>&V;sbek</HI> come every year to &s;ell their Hor&s;es. They reckon, that there are bought and &s;old, every year, above &s;ixty thou&s;and. They bring al&s;o out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> great numbers of Sheep, and other Cattel; it being the general Con|cour&s;e of <HI>Per&s;ians, Tartarians,</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> There is al&s;o Wine to be had; but Provi&s;ions go off at a very good rate.</P>
<P>Before I go any farther, I mu&s;t take notice of one thing in particular, con|cerning the people call'd <HI>Augans,</HI> who inhabit from <HI>Candahar</HI> to <HI>Caboul,</HI> to|ward the Mountains of <HI>Balch,</HI> a &s;turdy &s;ort of people, and great Robbers in the night-time. It is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Indians</HI> to clean&s;e and &s;crape their tongues every morning with a crooked piece of a root, which cau&s;es them to void a great quantity of Flegm and Rhume, and provokes vomiting. Now though tho&s;e people that inhabit the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India</HI> practi&s;e the &s;ame thing; neverthele&s;s they vomit very little in the morning, but when they come to eat, as &s;oon as they have &s;wallowed two or three bits, their lungs begin to &s;well, and they are con&s;train'd to go forth and vomit; after which, they return again to their Victuals with a very good appetite. Should they not do &s;o, they would not live above thirty years; and be&s;ides, they would be troubl'd with the Drop&s;ie.</P>

<P><HI>Lahor</HI> is the Metropolis of a Kingdom, built upon one of the five Rivers that de&s;cend from the Mountains of the North to &s;well the River <HI>Indus;</HI> and give the name of <HI>Peniab</HI> to all the Region which they water. This River at this time flows not within a league of the Town, being &s;ubject to change its&punc; Channel, and many times does very great mi&s;chief to the adjoyning Fields, through the rapid deluges which it makes. The City is large, and extends it &s;elf above a league in length. But the greate&s;t part of the Hou&s;es, which are higher than tho&s;e of <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Deli,</HI> fall to ruine, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive rains that have overflowed a great number of them. The King's Palace is an indifferent fair one, is not, as formerly it was, upon the River, which is fall'n off above a quarter of a league from it. There is Wine to be had at <HI>Lahor.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the by, that after you have pa&s;t <HI>Lahor,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Kakemir,</HI> that lies upon it toward the North, none of their Women have any hair upon any part of their bodies, and the Men but very little upon their chins.</P>

<P>Before you go any farther, you are to take notice that all the way from <HI>Lahor</HI> to <HI>Dehly,</HI> and from <HI>Dehly</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> is a continual walk &s;et on both &s;ides with fair Trees; an object mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the &s;ight&punc; But in &s;ome places the Trees are decay'd, and there is no care taken to Plant others in their &s;tead.</P>
<P><HI>Dehly</HI> is a great City near the River <HI>Gemma,</HI> which runs from the North to the South, afterwards from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t; and after it has pa&s;t by <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Kadione,</HI> empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Ganges.</HI> After <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> had built the new City of <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> which is call'd by his own Name; and where he cho&s;e rather to keep his Court, than at <HI>Agra,</HI> becau&s;e the Climate is more temperate. <HI>Dehly</HI> is almo&s;t come to ruine, and indeed is nothing but an heap of Rubbi&s;h; there be|ing no other Hou&s;es remaining but only for poor people. The Streets are narrow, and the Hou&s;es of <HI>Bambouc,</HI> as over all the re&s;t of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Neither are there above three or four Lords of the Court that re&s;ide at <HI>Dehly,</HI> where they &s;et up their Tents in great Enclo&s;ures, and in the &s;ame manner lodg'd the Reverend Je&s;uit that was at Court.</P>
<P><HI>Gehanabad,</HI> as well as <HI>Dehly,</HI> is a great City; and there is nothing but a &s;ingle Wall that make the &s;eparation. All the Hou&s;es of particular men con&s;i&s;t of great Enclo&s;ures, in the mid&s;t whereof is the place for Lodgings. The greate&s;t part of the Lords do not live in the City, but have their Hou&s;es without, for the con|veniency of the water. As you enter into <HI>Gehanabad</HI> from <HI>Dehly,</HI> you meet with a long and broad Street, on each &s;ide whereof are Vaults, where the Merchants keep &s;hops, being only plat-form'd at the top. This &s;treet ends in the great <HI>Piazza</HI> before the King's Hou&s;e; and there is another very fair and large Street, that runs toward another Gate of the &s;ame Palace, in which live the great Merchants that keep no Shops.</P>
<P>The King's Palace takes up above half a league circuit: The Walls are of fair cut-Stone with Battlements. The Moats are full of water, pav'd with Free|&s;tone. The great Gate of the Palace has nothing in it of magnificence; no more than the fir&s;t Court, into which the great Lords may enter upon their Elephants.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="180">
Having pa&s;t that Court, you enter into another long and large pa&s;&s;age, with fair Portico's on both &s;ides. Under which are &s;everal little Chambers, where part of the Hor&s;e-Guard lies. The&s;e Portico's are rais'd &s;ome two foot above the ground, and the Hor&s;es which are ti'd without, feed upon the &s;teps. In &s;ome places there are great Gates that lead to &s;everal Apartments; as to the Womens Lodgings, and to the Seat of Ju&s;tice. In the mid&s;t of the pa&s;&s;age runs a Cut full of water, leaving a fair Walk on each &s;ide, where, at equal di&s;tances, are little Ba&s;ons or Fountains.</P>
<P>This long Pa&s;&s;age carries you into a great Court, where the <HI>Omra</HI>'s, that is to &s;ay, the great Lords of the Kingdom, &s;uch as the <HI>Ba&s;ha's</HI> in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and the <HI>Kan's</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> keep Guard in Per&s;on. They have low Lodgings round about the Court, and their Hor&s;es are ti'd to their doors.</P>
<P>From this &s;econd Court you pa&s;s into a third, through a great Portal; on one &s;ide whereof there is a little Hall, rais'd &s;ome two or three &s;teps high from the ground. This is the Wardrobe where the Royal Garments are kept; and from whence the King &s;ends for the <HI>Calaat,</HI> or a whole Habit for a man, when he would honour any Stranger or any one of his own Subjects. A little farther, un|der the &s;ame Portal, is the place where the Drums, Trumpets, and Hautboys are laid up; which they &s;ound and beat a little before the King enters into his Judg|ment-Seat, to give notice to the <HI>Omrah</HI>'s; and they make the &s;ame noi&s;e when the King is ready to ri&s;e. Entring into the third Court, you &s;ee the <HI>Divan</HI> before you, where the King gives Audience. This is a great Hall rais'd &s;ome four-foot-high above the &s;uperficies of the Court, with three &s;ides open. Thirty-two Pil|lars &s;u&s;tain as many Arches; and the&s;e Columns are about four-foot-&s;quare, with Pede&s;tals and Mouldings. When <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> fir&s;t began to build this Hall; he in|tended to have enrich'd it, and inlaid it all over with tho&s;e Stones that &s;eem to be naturally painted, like tho&s;e in the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>'s Chappel. But having made a trial upon two or three Pillars, about two or three-foot-high, he found that there would not be Stones enough, of that &s;ort, in the World to fini&s;h the work' be&s;ides the va&s;tne&s;s of the Sum it would come to. So that he left off his de&s;ign, contening him&s;elf with a Painting of &s;everal flowers.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Hall, next to the &s;ide which looks toward the Court, there is a Throne erected upon a kind of Theater, where the King gives Audience, and pronounces Judgment. The Throne is a little Bed with four Columns, about the bigne&s;s of one of our Field-beds, with a Canopy, Backpiece, Boul&s;ter and Counterpoint, all embroider'd with Diamonds. Be&s;ides all this, when the King comes to &s;it upon the Throne, they throw over the Bed a Coverlet of Cloath of Gold, or &s;ome other richly-embroider'd Silk; and he a&s;cends by three little &s;teps, two-foot-broad. On one &s;ide of the Bed is erected an <HI>&V;mbrello</HI> upon a Staff, as long as an Half-Pike. Upon one of the Pillars of the Throne hangs one of the King's Weapons; upon another his Buckler; upon another his Sci|metar; and then his Bow and Quiver of Arrows, and other things of the &s;ame na|ture.</P>
<P>Below the Throne there is a place&punc;&s;ome twenty-foot-&s;quare, encompa&s;t with Balu&s;ters which at &s;ome times are cover'd with Plates of Silver, at other times with Plates of Gold. At the four Corners of this &s;mall enclo&s;ure &s;it the four Se|cretaries of State, who as well in Civil as Criminal Cau&s;es, do the duty of ad|vocates. Many Lords &s;tand about this Balu&s;t rade; and there is al&s;o the Mu&s;ick plac'd, that plays all the while the King is in the <HI>Divan.</HI> This Mu&s;ick is &s;o &s;weet and &s;oft, that it never takes off the mind from the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s at that time manag'd. The King being &s;at upon his Throne, &s;ome great Lords &s;tand by him; generally it is &s;ome one of his own Children. Between eleven a Clock and Noon, the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who is the chief Mini&s;ter of State, like the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> in <HI>Turkey,</HI> makes a report to the King of what has pa&s;t in the Chamber where he Pre&s;ides, which is at the Entry of the fir&s;t Court; and when he has done &s;peak|ing, the King ri&s;es. For you mu&s;t take notice, that from the time that the King is &s;ate upon his Throne, till he ri&s;es, no per&s;on what&s;oever is permitted to &s;tir out of the Palace; and yet I can &s;ay that the King di&s;penc'd with my performance of this Law &s;o generally ob&s;erv'd by all the Court: The occa&s;ion whereof was thus in &s;hort.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="180">
Being one day going out of the Palace, while the King was &s;itting in the <HI>Divan,</HI> upon &s;ome urgent bu&s;ine&s;s that would admit of no delay, the Captain of the Guards held me by the arm, and told me I &s;hould go no farther; I conte&s;ted and argued the Ca&s;e with him for &s;ome time, but finding his u&s;uage to be very boi&s;te|rous, I lifted up my Cane, and had certainly &s;trook him in my pa&s;&s;ion, had not two or three of the Guards that &s;aw all the pa&s;&s;ages, held my hand. Happily for me at that time, the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who was then the King's Uncle, came by, and being in|formed of the ground of our quarrel; order'd the Captain of the Guards to let me go. After that he made a report to the King how the matter &s;tood; and to|ward evening the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent me one of his Servants to tell me, it was his Ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that I might come in or go out of the Palace, though he were &s;itting in the <HI>Divan,</HI> as I pleas'd my &s;elf; for which I went the next day, and re|turn'd thanks to the <HI>Nahab.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the middle of the &s;ame Court there is a &s;mall Channel &s;ome five or &s;ix inches broad, where while the King is &s;itting upon the Seat of Ju&s;tice, they that have bu&s;ine&s;s are to &s;tand. Further it is not lawful for them to go, till they are call'd; and Emba&s;&s;adours them&s;elves are not exempted from this cu&s;tom. When an Emba&s;&s;adour, comes as far as this Channel, the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies calls out toward the <HI>Divan</HI> where the King is &s;itting, that &s;uch an Emba&s;&s;adour craves Audience of his Maje&s;ty. Then one of the Secretaries of State declares it to the King; who oftentimes makes as if he did not hear: But &s;ome time after lifting up his eyes, he ca&s;ts them upon the Emba&s;&s;adour, making him a &s;ign by the &s;ame Secretary, that he may approach.</P>
<P>From the Hall of the <HI>Divan,</HI> turning to the left, you walk upon a Terra&s;s, where you di&s;cover the River. Over this Terra&s;s the King pa&s;&s;es into a little Chamber, from whence he goes into his <HI>Haram.</HI> In this little Chamber it was that I had my fir&s;t Audience of his Maje&s;ty; as I &s;hall relate in another place.</P>
<P>Upon the left-hand of the Court where the <HI>Divan</HI> is built, &s;tands a little <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> neatly built; the <HI>Cupola</HI> whereof is cover'd with Lead perfectly guilded. Here the King goes to hear Prayers every day, except it be Fridays, when he is to go to the great <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which is a very fair one, and plac'd upon an high Platform, rais'd higher than the Hou&s;es of the City, and there is a noble a&s;cent to it. That day that the King goes to the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> they place huge rails of wood round about the &s;teps, as well to keep off the Elephants, as out of re&s;pect to the <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI></P>
<P>The right &s;ide of the Court is taken up with Portico's, that make a long Gal|lery, rais'd from the ground about half a foot; and the&s;e are the King's Stables into which you have many doors to enter. They are al&s;o full of &s;tately Hor&s;es, the wor&s;t whereof &s;tands the King in three-thou&s;and Crowns; and there are &s;ome that co&s;t him ten-thou&s;and. At the door of every one of the&s;e Stables hangs a kind of Mat made of <HI>Bambouc,</HI> that cleaves like our O&s;iers. But where|as we bind our O&s;ier twigs with the &s;ame O&s;ier, they bind their <HI>Bambouc's</HI> with wreath'd-Silk, which is delicate work, but very tedious. The&s;e Mats are to hin|der the Flies from tormenting the Hor&s;es; there being two Grooms to an Hor&s;e, one of which is &s;till employ'd in fanning the Bea&s;t. There are al&s;o Mats &s;pread before the Portico's, and before the Stable-door; which they &s;pread or take away as occa&s;ion requires. And the Floor of the Gallery is cover'd with fair Carpets, which is taken away in the evening, and the Hor&s;es Litter &s;trow'd in the &s;ame place. Which litter is nothing but the Hor&s;e-dung dri'd in the Sun, and then &s;queez'd a little flat. The Hor&s;es that are brought into <HI>India</HI> either out of <HI>Per&s;ia, Arabia,</HI> or the Country of <HI>&V;sbech,</HI> change their food: For in <HI>India</HI> they never give them Hay nor Oats. Every Hor&s;e in the morning having for his pro|portion three loaves made of Meal, Wheat, and Butter, as big as one of our &s;ix|penny-loaves. 'Tis an hard matter to bring them to this diet at fir&s;t; it being &s;ometimes three or four Months before they can do it. The Groom is forc'd to hold their tongue in one hand, and to thru&s;t down the bread with the other. When Sugar-Canes or Millet are in &s;ea&s;on, they give them that diet about noon; and in the evening, two hours before Sun-&s;et they give them a mea&s;ure of Gar|den-Chiches which the Groom &s;queezes between two &s;tones, and mixes with wa|ter.
<PB N="48" REF="181">
This is in&s;tead of Barley and Oats. As for the King's other Stables, where he has al&s;o very fine Hor&s;es, they are &s;curvy places, ill-built, which de&s;erve not to be mention'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gemene</HI> is a fair River that bears good big Boats, which running to <HI>Agra</HI> lo&s;es its name, falling into <HI>Ganges</HI> at <HI>Hallabas.</HI> The King has &s;everal &s;mall <HI>Brigan|tines</HI> at <HI>Gehanabad</HI> upon the River, to take his plea&s;ure in; and they are very cu|riou&s;ly trimm'd after the manner of the Countrey.</P>

The Hou&s;es of great Per&s;ons are fair, and well built; but the Hou&s;es of the meaner-&s;ort are as plain, as in all the other Cities of <HI>India.</HI> They are built a good di&s;tance one from another, and hid by the height of their Walls, to keep their Women from being &s;een: So that it may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd that their Cities are nothing &s;o plea&s;ant as ours in <HI>Europe.</HI> Add to this, that <HI>Agra</HI> being en|compa&s;t round with the Sands, the heats are there very exce&s;&s;ive, which con&s;train'd <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> to remove from thence, and to keep his Court at <HI>Gehanabad.</HI></P>
<P>All that is remarkable in <HI>Agra</HI> is the King's Palace; and &s;ome Monuments as well near the City, as in the parts about it. The Palace of the King is a va&s;t piece of ground encompa&s;t with a double-wall, which is terra&s;s'd in &s;ome parts, and in tho&s;e parts are built certain Lodgings for &s;ome of the Officers of the Court: The <HI>Gemene</HI> runs before the Palace; but between the Wall and the River there is a large &s;pace of ground, where the King cau&s;es his Elephants to fight. This Field is on purpo&s;e near the water, becau&s;e that the Elephant which gets the vi|ctory, being in a fury, they could not bring him to him&s;elf, did they not drive him into the River: to which end they are forc'd to have recour&s;e to Policy, by tying Squibs and Crackers to the end of an Half-Pike, and then giving fire to them to fright him into the water: for when he is in but two or threefoot-deep, he is pre&s;ently appeas'd.</P>
<P>There is a wide <HI>Piazza</HI> upon one &s;ide of the City before the Palace, and the fir&s;t Gate, wherein there is nothing of magnificence, is guarded by a few Soul|diers. Before the King removed his Court from <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> when he went into the Countrey for &s;ome time, he gave to &s;ome one of his greate&s;t <HI>Omrah's,</HI> who was his Confident, the Guard of his Palace, where his Trea&s;ure lay;
<PB N="49" REF="181">
and till the return of the King he never &s;tirr'd out of the Gate, where he lodg'd, neither by night nor day. At &s;uch a time that it was, that I was permitted to &s;ee the Palace of <HI>Agra.</HI> The King being departed for <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> whither all the Court followed him, together with the Women, the Government of the Palace was given to one that was a great Friend of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and indeed to all the <HI>Franguis. Menheir Velant,</HI> chief of the <HI>Holland Factory</HI> at <HI>Agra,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the King was departed, went to vi&s;it the Lord, and to pre&s;ent him according to cu&s;tom. The Pre&s;ent was worth about 6000 Crowns, and con&s;i&s;ted in Spices, Cabinets of <HI>Japan,</HI> and fine <HI>Holland</HI>-Cloath. He de&s;ir'd me to go along with him when he went to Compliment the Governour. But the Lord being offended that he had put him&s;elf to &s;o much charge, forc'd him to carry the Pre&s;ent back again, taking only one <HI>Japan</HI>-Cane, of &s;ix that were in the Pre&s;ent, telling him he would have no more, out of the kindne&s;s which he had for the <HI>Franguiz.</HI> Nay, he would not &s;o much as take the Gold-head and <HI>Ferula,</HI> but caus'd them to be taken off. The Complements being over, the Governour ask'd <HI>Menheir Velunt,</HI> wherein he might &s;erve him: whereupon he de&s;iring the favour, than &s;ince the Court was gone, he might &s;ee the in&s;ide of the Palace, the Governour granted his reque&s;t, and order'd &s;ix men to attend him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Gate where the Governor of the Palace lies, is a long blind Arch, which leads you into a large Court all environ'd with Portico's; like our <HI>Piazza</HI> in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> The Gallery in front is larger and higher than any of the re&s;t, &s;u&s;tain'd by three ranks of Pillars, and under tho&s;e Galleries on the other &s;ide of the Court which are narrower and lower, are little Chambers for the Souldiers of the Guard. In the mid&s;t of the large Gallery, is a Nich in the Wall, into which the King de&s;cends out of his <HI>Haram</HI> by a private pair of Stairs, and when he is in, he &s;eems to be in a kind of a Tomb. He has no Guards with him then, for he has no rea&s;on to be afraid of any thing; there being no way to come at him. In the heat of the day he keeps him&s;elf there only with one Eunuch, but more often with one of his Children, to fan him. The Great Lords of the Court &s;tay below in the Gallery under the Nich all the while.</P>
<P>At the farther end of this Court is another Gate that leads into a &s;econd Court encompa&s;t with Galleries, underneath which, are little Chambers for &s;ome Officers of the Palace. The &s;econd Court carries you into a third, which is the King's Quarter. <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> had re&s;olv'd to cover with Silver all the Arch of a Gallery upon the right-hand. And a french-man, <HI>Au&s;tin de Bordeaux</HI> by name, was to have done the work: but the King not finding any one in his whole King|dom &s;o capable as the <HI>French</HI>-man was to treat with the <HI>Portugals</HI> at <HI>Goa</HI> about &s;ome important affair he had at this time; the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide: For they being afraid of <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s Parts, poi&s;on'd him upon his return to <HI>Cochin.</HI> This Gal|lery is painted with branch'd-work of Gold and Azure, and the lower-part is hung with Tape&s;try. There are &s;everal doors under the Gallery that lead into little &s;quare-Chambers; of which we &s;aw two or three open'd, and they told us all the re&s;t were &s;uch. The other three &s;ides of the Court lie all open, there be|ing nothing but a &s;ingle Wall, no higher than for a man to lean over. On the &s;ide that looks toward the River there is a <HI>Divan,</HI> or a kind of out-jutting Bal|cony, where the King &s;its to &s;ee his Brigantines, or to behold his Elephants fight. Before the <HI>Divan</HI> is a Gallery, that &s;erves for a Portico; which <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> had a de&s;ign to have adorn'd all over with a kind of Lattice-work of Emraulds and Ru|bies that &s;hould have repre&s;ented to the life Grapes when they are green, and when they begin to grow red. But this de&s;ign which made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the World, and requir'd more Riches, than all the World could afford to perfect, remains unfini&s;h'd; there being only three Stocks of a Vine in Gold, with their leaves, as the re&s;t ought to have been; and enamel'd in their natural colours, with Em|ralds, Rubies and Granates wrought into the fa&s;hion of Grapes. In the middle of the Court &s;tands a great Fat to bath in, 40 foot in Diameter, cut out of one entire grey-&s;tone, with &s;teps wrought out of the &s;ame &s;tone within and with|out.</P>
<P>As for the Monuments which are in and about <HI>Agra,</HI> they are very fair ones, for there is &s;carce an Eunuch belonging to the King's <HI>Haram,</HI> that is not very ambitious of leaving a fair Monument behind him. Indeed, when they have
<PB N="50" REF="182">
heap'd together great Sums, they would fain be going to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and ma|king rich Pre&s;ents to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> But the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> unwilling to let his Money go out of his Country, will &s;eldom permit them leave to undertake that Pilgrimage: and therefore not knowing what to do with their Money, they employ a great part thereof in Monuments to perpetuate their Memo|ries.</P>
<P>Of all the Monuments that are to be &s;een at <HI>Agra,</HI> that of the Wife of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> is the mo&s;t magnificent; &s;he caus'd it to be &s;et up on purpo&s;e near the <HI>Ta&s;imacan,</HI> to which all Strangers mu&s;t come, that they &s;hould admire it. The <HI>Ta&s;imacan</HI> is a great <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place, compos'd of &s;ix great Courts, all encompa&s;&s;ed with <HI>Portico's;</HI> under which there are Warehou&s;es for Mer|chants; and where there is a prodigious quantity of Calicuts vended. The Monument of this <HI>Degum,</HI> or <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> &s;tands on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the City, upon the River &s;ide, in a great place enclo&s;ed with Walls, upon which there runs a little Gallery, as upon the Walls of many Cities in <HI>Europe.</HI> This place is a kind of Garden with Compartiments, like our Garden-plots; but whereas our Walks are made with Gravel, here the Walks are black and white Marble. You enter into this place through a large Portal; and pre&s;ently upon the left hand you e&s;py a fair Gallery, that looks towards <HI>Mecca;</HI> wherein there are three or four Niches, wherein the <HI>Mufti</HI> comes at certain hours to pray. A little beyond the middle of the place, toward the Water, are three great Plat|forms, one rais'd above another, with four Towers at the four Corners of each, and Stairs within, upon the top whereof they call the people before the time of their prayer. On the top there is a <HI>Cupola,</HI> little le&s;s magnificent than that of <HI>Val de Grace</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> it is cover'd within and without with black marble, the middle being of Brick. Under this <HI>Cupola</HI> is an empty Tomb; for the <HI>Be|gum</HI> is interr'd under the Arch of the lowe&s;t Platform. The &s;ame change of Ceremonies which is ob&s;erv'd under ground, is ob&s;erv'd above. For they change the Tape&s;tries, Candles, and other Ornaments at &s;everal times, and there are always <HI>Mollah's</HI> attending to pray. I &s;aw the beginning and compleating of this great work, that co&s;t two and twenty years labour, and twenty thou&s;and men always at work; &s;o that you cannot conceive but that the Expence mu&s;t be exce&s;&s;ive. <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> had begun to rai&s;e his own Monument on the other &s;ide of the River; but the Wars with his Son, broke off that de&s;ign, nor did <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> now reigning, ever take any care to fini&s;h it. There is an <HI>Eunuch</HI> who commands two thou&s;and men, that is entru&s;ted to guard not only the Sepulcher of the <HI>Begum,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>Ta&s;imacan.</HI></P>
<P>On another &s;ide of the City, appears the Sepulcher of King <HI>Akabar.</HI> And as for the Sepulchers of the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> they have only one Platform, with four little Chambers at the four Corners. When you come to <HI>Agra</HI> from <HI>Dehly,</HI> you meet a great <HI>Bezar;</HI> near to which there is a Garden, where King <HI>Jehan|guire,</HI> Father of <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> lies interr'd. Over the Garden Gate you &s;ee the Tomb it &s;elf, be&s;et with Portraitures, cover'd with a black Hear&s;e-Cloath, or Pall, with Torches of white Wax, and two <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> attending at each end. There are &s;ome who wonder, that <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> again&s;t the practice of the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who abhor Images, did permit of carving; but the rea&s;on conjectur'd at is, that it is done upon the con&s;ideration that his Father and him&s;elf learnt from the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> certain principles of Mathematicks and A&s;trology. Though he had not the &s;ame kindne&s;s for them at another time; for going one day to vi&s;it an <HI>Armenian,</HI> that lay &s;ick, who&s;e name was <HI>Corgia,</HI> whom he lov'd very well and had honor'd with &s;everal Employments, at what time the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> who liv'd next to the <HI>Armenians</HI> hou&s;e, rang their Bell; the &s;ound thereof &s;o di&s;pleas'd the King, as being a di&s;turbance to the &s;ick per&s;on, that in a great fury he commanded the Bell to be taken away, and hung about his Elephants neck. Some few days after, the King &s;eeing his Elephant with that great Bell about his neck, fearing &s;o great a weight might injure his Elephant, caus'd the Bell to be carried to the <HI>Couteval,</HI> which is a kind of a rail'd place, where a Provo&s;t &s;its as a Judg, and decides differences among the people of that Quarter, where it has hung ever &s;ince. This <HI>Armenian</HI> had been brought up with <HI>Cha-jehan;</HI> and in regard he was an excellent Wit, and an excellent Poet,
<PB N="51" REF="182">
he was very much in the Kings favour, who had confer'd upon him many fair Commands, though he could never either by threats or promi&s;es win him to turn <HI>Mahometan.</HI></P>

There are many Inns in the Town; among the re&s;t, one very large, and very hand&s;omely built In the middle of the Court are two Galleries, where are to be &s;old Calicuts, Silks, and other &s;orts of Merchandi&s;e. The greate&s;t part of the Sellers, are the Workmen them&s;elves; &s;o that the Merchants buy at the fir&s;t hand. The&s;e Workmen, before they expo&s;e any thing to &s;ale, mu&s;t go to him that has the &s;tamp, to have the King's Seal &s;et upon their Linnen and Silks; otherwi&s;e they would be fin'd, and lamba&s;ted with a good Cudgel. This City is &s;cituated upon the North &s;ide of <HI>Ganges,</HI> that &punc;runs by the Walls, and into which there falls al&s;o another River, &s;ome two leagues upward toward the We&s;t.

<P><HI>Daca</HI> is a great Town, that extends it &s;elf only in length; every one coveting to have an Hou&s;e by the <HI>Ganges</HI>-&s;ide. The length of this Town is above two leagues.

The&s;e Hou&s;es are properly no more than paltry Huts built up with <HI>Bambouc's,</HI> and daub'd over with fat Earth. Tho&s;e of <HI>Daca</HI> are not much better built: The Governours Palace is a place enclos'd with high Walls, in the mid&s;t whereof is a pitiful Hou&s;e, built only of Wood. He generally lodges in Tents, which he cau&s;es to be &s;et up in a great Court of that Enclo&s;ure. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> finding that their Goods were not &s;afe in the ordinary Hou&s;es of <HI>Daca,</HI> have built them a very fair Hou&s;e; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have another, which is rea&s;onably hand&s;om.

<PB N="56" REF="185">
the Sea flowing up higher then <HI>Daca. Cha-Est-Kan,</HI> Uncle to King <HI>Aureng|zeb,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Mogul,</HI> and the be&s;t Head-piece that ever was in all his Territo|ries, found out a way to corrupt &s;everal of the King of <HI>Aracan</HI>'s Captains, &s;o that of a &s;udden forty Galea&s;&s;es, commanded by <HI>Portugals,</HI> came and join'd them&s;elves with him. To engage more firmly all this new multitude to his &s;ervice, he gave a larger pay to all the <HI>Portugal</HI>-Officers, and to the Souldiers proportiona|bly: But tho&s;e of the Country had no more than their ordinary pay doubl'd. 'Tis an incredible thing to &s;ee how &s;wiftly the&s;e Galea&s;&s;es cut their way in the wa|ter. Some are &s;o long that they carry fifty Oars of a &s;ide; but they have but two men to an Oare: There are fome very curiou&s;ly painted, and upon which there is no co&s;t of Gold and Azure &s;par'd. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have &s;ome of their own to tran&s;port their Goods; and &s;ometimes they are forc'd to hire others, whereby many people get a good livelihood.</P>
<P>The next day after my arrival at <HI>Daca,</HI> which was the 14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> I went to wait upon the <HI>Nahab;</HI> and pre&s;ented him with a Garment of Cloath of Gold, lac'd with a Gold-needle-work Lace of Point of <HI>Spain;</HI> with a Scarf of Gold and Silver, of the &s;ame Point; and a very fair Emrald-Jewel. Toward evening, being return'd to the <HI>Hollander</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where I lodg'd, the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent me Gra|nates, <HI>China</HI>-Oranges, two <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>-Melons, and three &s;orts of Pears.</P>
<P>The fifteenth, I &s;hewed him my Goods, and pre&s;ented the Prince with a Watch, in a Gold-Enamell'd-Ca&s;e; with a pair of little Pi&s;tols inlaid with Silver, and a very fair Pro&s;pective-Gla&s;s. What I gave to the Father and the Son, a young Lord, about ten years old, &s;tood me in above five thou&s;and Livres.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth, I treated with him about the Prizes of my Goods: and at length I went to his Steward to take my Letter of Exchange to be paid at <HI>Ca&s;en-Bazar.</HI> Not but that he would have paid me my Money at <HI>Daca;</HI> but the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who under&s;tood things better than I did, told me it was very dangerous to carry Mony to <HI>Ca&s;en-Bazar,</HI> whither there was no going, but over the <HI>Ganges</HI> by water, the way by land being full of Bogs and Fens. And to go by water is no le&s;s dangerous, by rea&s;on that the Boats which they u&s;e, are very apt to tip over upon the lea&s;t &s;torm: And when the Mariners perceive that you carry Money along with you, 'tis an ea&s;y thing for them to over&s;et the Boat, and afterwards to come and take up the Money that lies but at the bottom of the River.</P>
<P>The twentieth, I took leave of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who de&s;ir'd me to come and &s;ee him again, and caus'd a Pa&s;s to be deliver'd me, wherein he gave me the title of one of the Gentlemen of his hou&s;e, which he had done before, when he was Go|vernor of <HI>Amadabat,</HI> when I went to him, to the Army, in the Province of <HI>Decan,</HI> into which the <HI>Raja-&s;eva-gi</HI> was enter'd, as I &s;hall relate in another place.

<P>The one and twentieth, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a great Fea&s;t for my &s;ake; to which they invited the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e's,</HI> together with the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Friers of the &s;ame Nation.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth, I made a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who&s;e Pre&s;ident then was Mr. <HI>Prat.</HI></P>
<P>From the twenty-third to the twenty-ninth, I brought up Goods, to the value of 11000 Roupies; and after I had embark'd them, I took my leave.</P>
<P>The twenty-ninth, in the evening, I departed from <HI>Daca,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> bear|ing me company for two leagues, with their little Barques Arm'd: Nor did we &s;pare the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Wine all that time. Having been upon the River from the twenty-ninth of <HI>January</HI> to the eleventh of <HI>February,</HI> I left my Goods and Ser|vants at the Barque at <HI>Acerat;</HI> where I took a Boat that carri'd me to a great Village call'd <HI>Mirdapour.</HI></P>
<P>The next day I hir'd an Hor&s;e for my &s;elf, but not finding another for my Lug|gage, I was forc'd to hire two Women, who carri'd it for me.

<P>The &s;ixteenth, I wrote to the <HI>Nahab,</HI> to know the rea&s;on why he had for|bad his Receiver General to pay me.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth in the evening, I took water for <HI>Ougueli,</HI> in a Bark of four|teen Oars, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lent me; and that night and the next I lay upon the River.</P>
<P>The ninteenth toward evening, I pa&s;s'd by a large Town call'd <HI>Nandi,</HI> far|ther than which the Sea does not flow. Here the Wind blew &s;o fiercely, and the water grew &s;o rough, that we were forc'd to &s;tay three or four hours, and ly by the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The twentieth, I arriv'd at <HI>Ougueli,</HI> where I &s;tay'd till the &s;econd of <HI>March.</HI> During which time the <HI>Hollanders</HI> bid me very welcome, and made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew me all the diverti&s;ements which the Country was capable to afford. We went &s;everal times in Plea&s;ure-Boats upon the River, and we had a Banquet of all the Delicacies that the Gardens of <HI>Europe</HI> could have afforded us. Salads of all &s;orts, Colewarts, A&s;paragus, Pea&s;e, but our chiefe&s;t Di&s;h was <HI>Japon</HI> Beans; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being very curious to have all &s;orts of Pul&s;e and Herbs in their Gardens, though they could never get Artichokes to grow in that Country.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of <HI>March</HI> I left <HI>Ougueli,</HI> and the fifth arriv'd at <HI>Ca&s;enba&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>The next day I went to <HI>Made&s;ou-Bar&s;aki,</HI> to know whether the <HI>Nahab</HI> had &s;ent any other orders to his Receiver. For I told you a little before, that I wrote upon the place to <HI>Cha-Est-Kan,</HI> to complain of his proceedings, and to know the rea&s;on why my Bill of Exchange was not paid. The Director of the <HI>Holland</HI> Factories writ a Letter al&s;o in my behalf, which I enclo&s;ed, wherein he repre&s;ented to the <HI>Nahab,</HI> that I was too well known to him, as having been formerly with him at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> in the Army in <HI>Decan,</HI> and other places, do de&s;erve &s;uch hard u&s;uage. That he ought to con&s;ider, that I being the only per&s;on that brought the chiefe&s;t rarities of <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> it was not the way to make me eager of returning any more, as he him&s;elf had invited me to do, to &s;end me away in a di&s;content. Be&s;ides, that the credit of my report would di&s;courage others from coming to the <HI>Indies,</HI> fearing the &s;ame u&s;uage as I had receiv'd. Neither mine nor the Directors Letter produc'd that effect which we expected. Nor was I much better &s;atisfi'd with the new order which the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent to his Receiver; which was to pay me, abating twenty thou&s;and Roupies of the &s;um which we had agreed upon; and if I would not take the remainder, that I might come and fetch my goods again.</P>
<P>This ill dealing of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> proceeded from a &s;curvy trick that was play'd me by three Canary-birds at the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court. The &s;tory whereof was thus in &s;hort.</P>
<P><HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> that now reigns, at the in&s;tigation of two <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and a <HI>Banian,</HI> has brought up a cu&s;tom very much to the di&s;advantage of Merchants, that come out of <HI>Europe,</HI> and other parts, to &s;ell Jewels at Court. For whether they come into <HI>India</HI> either by Land or Sea, the Governour of the place where they fir&s;t arrive, has order to &s;end them to the King, together with their goods, whether they will or no. As the Governour of <HI>Surat</HI> dealt by me, in the year 1665, &s;ending me to <HI>Dehli,</HI> or <HI>Jehanabad,</HI> where the King was. There were then attending upon his Maje&s;ty, two <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and a <HI>Banian,</HI> who are entru&s;ted to view and examine all the Jewels which are to be &s;old to the King. One of tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is call'd <HI>Nahab-Akel-Kan,</HI> that is, the <HI>Prince of the Spirit;</HI> who keeps all the Kings Jewels. The name of the other is
<PB N="56" REF="186">
<HI>Mirza-Mou&s;on,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to rate every &s;tone. The <HI>Banian,</HI> who&s;e name is <HI>Nalikan,</HI> is to &s;ee whether the Stones be fal&s;e or not, or whether they have any defect. The&s;e three men have obtain'd a Licence from the King, to view, before ever he does, whatever forreign Merchants &s;hall bring to Court, and to pre&s;ent their goods to him them&s;elves. And though they are under an Oath not to take any thing from the Merchants, yet they extort whatever they can get from them, though it be their ruine. When they &s;ee any thing that is lovely, and likely to bring great profit, they would per&s;wade you to &s;ell it to them for le&s;s by half than the King is worth; and if you refu&s;e to let them have it, when they are in the Kings pre&s;ence, they will &s;et a price upon it at half the value; knowing that <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> is not very covetous of Jewels, loving his Money far better. Upon the Kings Fe&s;tival-day, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in another place, all the Princes and Nobility of the Court pre|&s;ent him with mo&s;t magnificent gifts. And when they cannot meet with Jewels, they &s;end him Roupies of Gold, which the King likes far better than Stones; though Jewels are the more honourable pre&s;ent. Therefore when this Fe&s;tival draws nigh, he i&s;&s;ues out of his Trea&s;ury, a great quantity of Diamonds, Ru|bies, Emraulds, and Pearls, which he who is entru&s;ted to prize the Stones, de|livers to &s;everal Merchents to &s;ell to the Nobility, who are bound to pre&s;ent the King; by which means the King gets the Money and his Jewels again.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another thing very di&s;advantageous to a Merchant Jeweller, which is, that when the King has &s;een the Stones, no Prince nor Nobleman that knows of it, will ever buy them. Be&s;ides, while the&s;e three per&s;ons, who are entru&s;ted to view the Jewels, are con&s;idering and examining them at their Lodgings, &s;everal <HI>Banians</HI> re&s;ort thither, who are expert, &s;ome in Diamonds, &s;ome in Rubies, &s;ome in Emraulds, and others in Pearls, who write down the weight, goodne&s;s, cleanne&s;s, and colour of every piece. So that when a Mer|chant goes afterwards to any Prince or Governour of any Province, the&s;e people &s;end them a note of what he has, and the price, which they &s;et down at half the value. For in trade the&s;e <HI>Banians</HI> are a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than the <HI>Jews;</HI> more expert in all &s;orts of cunning tricks, and more maliciou&s;ly mi&s;chie|vous in their revenge. Now you &s;hall hear what a trick the&s;e unworthy peo|ple &s;erv'd me.</P>
<P>When I arriv'd at <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> one of them came to my Lodging, and told me, he had order from the King to &s;ee what I had brought, before I expos'd my goods in the Kings pre&s;ence. They would have rather that the King had not been at <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> for they would have then endeavour'd to have bought them them&s;elves, to gain thereby, by &s;elling them again to the King, or the Nobility upon occa&s;ion; which they could never per&s;wade me to. The next day they came to &s;ee me all three, one after another; and they would needs have of me, among&s;t other things, a Jewel of nine great Pearls, in the fa&s;hion of a Pear, the bigge&s;t whereof weigh'd thirty Carats, and the lea&s;t &s;ixteen; together with another &s;ingle Pearl like a Pear, of fifty-five Carats. As for the Jewel&punc; the King took it; but for the &s;ingle Pearl, they finding that what|ever they could &s;ay, I would not be wrought upon to &s;ell them any bargains, &s;o order'd it, that before I had &s;hew'd my Jewels to the King, <HI>Giafer-Kan</HI> the Kings Unckle &s;aw, and kept it, telling me he would give me as good a price as the King; and de&s;ir'd me not to &s;peak of it, for indeed he had a de|&s;ign to make a pre&s;ent to the King.</P>
<P>When the King had made choice of &s;uch of my Jewels as he pleas'd, <HI>Giafer-Kan</HI> bought of me &s;everal pieces, and at the &s;ame time agreed with me for the great Pearl. Some days after he paid me, according as we had agreed, ex|cept for the Pearl, upon which he would have abated me ten thou&s;and Rou|pies. For the two <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the <HI>Banian</HI> had malitiou&s;ly inform'd him, that at my fir&s;t arrival, they could have bought the Pearl for eight or ten thou&s;and Roupies le&s;s than I had valu'd it to him; which was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. There|upon <HI>Giafer-Kan</HI> telling me, that if I would not take his Money, I might have my Jewel again; I took him at his word, a&s;&s;uring him, he &s;hould never &s;ee it again as long as he liv'd. And I was as good as my word. And indeed that which made me the more re&s;olute was, that I was re&s;olv'd to carry &s;ome|thing
<PB N="59" REF="186">
which was con&s;iderable to <HI>Cha-Est-Kan;</HI> for could I have had my li|berty upon my arrival at <HI>Surat</HI> to have gone to him, I would never have &s;een the King at <HI>Gehanabad;</HI> about which I had a very great quarrel with the Go|vernour of <HI>Surat.</HI> For when I came to vi&s;it him, he told me pre&s;ently, that the ca&s;e was alter'd from what it had been &s;ince my la&s;t being there, for that the King was re&s;olv'd to have the fir&s;t view of all Curio&s;ities imported into his Kingdom. I was above four Months contending in vain with the Gover|nour; but nothing would &s;erve; I mu&s;t go to the King, and for fear I &s;hould take another Road, he &s;ent fifteen Hor&s;emen along with me as far as <HI>Sha|laour.</HI></P>
<P>When I went for <HI>Bengala,</HI> the&s;e Over&s;eers of the Jewels, out of meer &s;pite, and, it may be, &s;et on by <HI>Giafar-Kan,</HI> to be reveng'd of me for denying to let him have my Jewel, writ to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> that I intended to &s;hew him certain Jewels, among the re&s;t a very fair Pearl, which I had &s;old to <HI>Giafer-Kan;</HI> but that he had given it me again, becau&s;e he under&s;tood that I would have made him pay for it, ten thou&s;and Roupies more than it was worth. They wrote al&s;o the particular proportion of all the other Stones which I carry'd. And upon this fal&s;e and malicious advice it was, that <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> who receiv'd not this informa|tion till he had deliver'd me my Bill of Exchange, would abate me for my whole parcel, twenty thou&s;and Roupies, which he reduc'd at length to ten thou&s;and; and well I had it too.</P>
<P>Since I told you before, what a Pre&s;ent I gave to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kam;</HI> I think it not ami&s;s to tell you, what I gave the King, to <HI>Nehab Giafer-Kan,</HI> to the Eunuch of the Grand <HI>Begum, Aurengzeb</HI>'s Si&s;ter, the Great Trea&s;urer, and the Porters of the Trea&s;ury. For you mu&s;t take notice, that whoever he be, that craves Audience of the King, they ask him in the fir&s;t place, where the Pre|&s;ent is which he intends for the King; and examine whether it be fitting to pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty. For no man mu&s;t come into his pre&s;ence empty handed, though it be an honour dearly purchas'd. Coming then to <HI>Gehanabad,</HI> I went to make my obei&s;ance to the King; and this is the Pre&s;ent which I made him.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, a Buckler of Bra&s;s highly embo&s;s'd, and very richly guilt, the co&s;t of the Guilding alone amounting to two hundred Ducats of Gold, or eighteen hundred Livres; the value of the whole piece coming to four thou|&s;and three hundred &s;eventy eight Livres. In the middle thereof was the &s;tory of <HI>Curtius,</HI> who threw him&s;elf and his Hor&s;e into the <HI>Barathrum,</HI> when the Earth gap'd, near <HI>Rome.</HI> Round the outermo&s;t Circle of the Buckler, was re|pre&s;ented the &s;iege of <HI>Rochel.</HI> It was wrought by one of the be&s;t Workmen in <HI>France,</HI> by the order of the Cardinal <HI>Richlieu.</HI> All the great Lords that were about <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> at that time, were charm'd at the beauty of the Workman|&s;hip, and told him, he could not do better, than to put it upon the great Ele|phant, which carry'd the Standard before his Maje&s;ty when he march'd into the Field.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ented him al&s;o with a Battle-Axe of Chry&s;tal of the Rock, the &s;ides where|of were &s;et with Rubies and Emraulds, enchas'd in Gold in the body of the Chry|&s;tal, which co&s;t three thou&s;and one hundred and nineteen Livres.</P>
<P>Moreover, I pre&s;ented him with a Saddle after the <HI>Turky</HI> fa&s;hion, embroider'd with little Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, which co&s;t two thou&s;and eight hundred and ninety-two Livres.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ented him al&s;o with another Saddle and Foot-cloath, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, to the value of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty Livers. The whole Pre&s;ent amounting to twelve thou&s;and one hundred and nineteen Livres.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ent which I made to <HI>Giafar-Kan,</HI> the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Unkle, was a Ta|ble, with other nineteen pieces to make a Cabinet, all natural Stones, of divers co|lours, repre&s;enting the &s;hapes of &s;everal Birds and Flowers. The work was made at <HI>Florence,</HI> and co&s;t two thou&s;and one hundred and fifty Livres.</P>
<P>A perfect Ruby Ring, which co&s;t one thou&s;and and three hundred Livres.</P>
<P>To the great Trea&s;urer, I pre&s;ented a Watch in a Gold Ca&s;e, &s;et with &s;mall Emraulds, at &s;even hundred and twenty Livres.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="187">
To the Porters of the Kings Trea&s;ury, and tho&s;e that deliver out the Money out of the Trea&s;ury, two hundred Roupies, at three hundred Livres.</P>
<P>To the Eunuch of the Great <HI>Begum,</HI> Si&s;ter to <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> a Watch in a painted Ca&s;e, which co&s;t two hundred and &s;ixty Livres.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Pre&s;ents which I made, as well to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> as to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan, Giafer-Kan,</HI> his Maje&s;ties Uncles; as al&s;o the Great Trea&s;urer, to the Ste|wards of the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Kan</HI>'s, and tho&s;e that brought me twice the <HI>Calaat,</HI> or Habit of Honour from the King, and as many times from the <HI>Begum</HI> his Si|&s;ter, and once from <HI>Giafar Kan;</HI> all the&s;e Pre&s;ents, I &s;ay, came to twenty-three thou&s;and one hundred four&s;core and &s;even Livres. So true it is, that they who have any bu&s;ine&s;s to do at the Court of the great Princes, as well in <HI>Turky</HI> as in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and in the <HI>Indies,</HI> mu&s;t not pretend to do any thing in reference to their affairs, till they have their Pre&s;ents, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable, ready. Be&s;ides, that his Pur&s;e mu&s;t be continually open to divers Officers of meaner reputation, who may be able to &s;erve him. I did not mention in my fir&s;t Volume the Pre|&s;ent which I made to him that brought me the <HI>Calaat</HI> from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to whom I gave two hundred Crowns.</P>

<P><HI>Dultabat</HI> is one of the be&s;t Fortre&s;&s;es in the Kingdoms of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> upon a Mountain every way &s;teep; the only way to it being &s;o narrow, that but one Hor&s;e, or one Camel can go at a time. This City is at the foot of the Mountain, very well wall'd. And this place of &s;uch importance, which the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s lo&s;t, when the Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> revolted from them, was retaken in the Reign of <HI>Jehan-guire,</HI> by a &s;ubtle &s;tratagem. <HI>Sultan Courom,</HI> who was afterwards call'd <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> commanded in <HI>Decan</HI> the Army of the King his Father; and <HI>A&s;t-Kan,</HI> Father in Law to <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> who was one of the Generals, gave the Prince &s;ome &s;ort of language which &s;o highly offended him, that immediately &s;ending for one of his Papouche's, or Shoo's, he caus'd him to have &s;ix blows given him upon the Bonnet; which among the <HI>Indians</HI> is the
<PB N="61" REF="187">
highe&s;t indignity can be put upon a man, after which he is no more to appear in the Prince's pre&s;ence. This was done by con&s;ent between the Prince and the General, to deceive the World, more e&s;pecially any Spies which the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> might have in the Prince's Army. The report of <HI>A&s;t-Kan's</HI> di&s;grace was immediately &s;pread abroad: and he him&s;elf flying for Sanctuary to the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> who had not cunning enough to di&s;cern the impo&s;ture, was welcom'd by the &s;ame King, and a&s;&s;ur'd of his protection. <HI>A&s;t-Kan</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o well receiv'd, begg'd leave of the King, that he might retire with ten or twelve of his Women, and as many of his Servants, into the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Dultabat,</HI> which was granted. He enter'd the Town with eight or ten Camels, the two <HI>Cajava's</HI> or Litters on each &s;ide of the Camel being clo&s;e &s;hut, to keep the Women from being &s;een. But in&s;tead of Women, he had put into every <HI>Cajava</HI> two Souldiers, all bold and re&s;olv'd men, as were al&s;o every one of the &s;uppos'd Eunuchs that led the Camels: &s;o that he had no great difficulty to cut the Garri&s;on in pieces, not being upon their guard; and to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the place, which has been ever &s;ince under the Power of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> There are in the place a great number of excellent Pieces of Cannon, and the Cannoniers are generally <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Hollanders.</HI> True it is, that there is one little Mountain higher than the Fortre&s;s; but there is hardly any way to it, but through the &s;ame Fortre&s;s. There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Engineer, who after he had &s;erv'd the King fifteen or &s;ixteen years, de&s;ir'd leave to be gone, and the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company it &s;elf, that had recom|mended him to the Service, did all they could to obtain it; but they could ne|ver procure it; becau&s;e he was an excellent Cannonier, and very skilful in make|ing Fire-works. The <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eing,</HI> who is the mo&s;t Potent of all the Idolatrous Princes of <HI>India,</HI> and who was mo&s;t powerfully In&s;trumental to put the Crown upon <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s Head, was &s;ent as <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> of the Army of this King, again&s;t the <HI>Raja Seva-gi;</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing by the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Dultabat,</HI> this <HI>Dutch|guis,</HI> as well as he. The <HI>Hollander</HI> laying hold of this opportunity, told the <HI>Raja,</HI> that if he would procure him a Licence to depart, he would &s;hew him a way to get up a Cannon, and to mount them upon that Mountain which commanded the Fortre&s;s: for they had already wall'd it about, and put Souldiers upon it to keep it &s;ecure. The <HI>Raja</HI> pleas'd with his propo&s;al, a&s;&s;ur'd him that he would procure him the King's Licence, if he perform'd what he had propos'd. Thereupon the <HI>Hollander</HI> undertaking and accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign, the <HI>Raja</HI> was as good as his word, and obtain'd of the King to di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Cannonier: who came to <HI>Surat</HI> when I was there, about the beginning of the year 1667; whence he em|bark'd for <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and the Wars which it has maintain'd for &s;ome few years la&s;t pa&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> take it in general, is a good Country, abounding in Corn, Rice, Cattel, Sheep, Poultry, and other nece&s;&s;aries for human life. In regard there are great &s;tore of Lakes in it, there is al&s;o great &s;tore of Fi&s;h. Above all the re&s;t, there is a &s;ort of Smelt, that has but one bone in the middle, which is mo&s;t delicious food. Nature has contributed more than Art, toward the making the&s;e Lakes, whereof the Country is full; which are generally in places &s;omewhat rais'd, &s;o that you need do no more than make a lit|tle Dam upon the plain-&s;ide to keep in the water. The&s;e Dams or Banks are &s;ome|times half a league long: and after the rainy &s;ea&s;ons are over, they open the Sluces from time to time to let out the water into the adjacent Fields, where it is receiv'd by divers little Channels to water particular grounds.</P>
<P><HI>Bagnager</HI> is the name of the Metropolis of this Kingdom; but vulgarly it is call'd <HI>Golconda,</HI> from the name of a Fortre&s;s, not above two leagues di&s;tant from it, where the King keeps his Court. This Fortre&s;s is about two leagues in cir|cuit, and by con&s;equence requires a numerous Guard. It is as it were a Town where the King keeps his Trea&s;ure: having left <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> ever &s;ince it was &s;ack'd by the Army, which <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>Bagnagar</HI> is then the City, which they vulgarly call <HI>Golconda;</HI> and it was foun|ded by the great Grandfather of the pre&s;ent King; upon the importunity of one of his Wives, whom he pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd, who&s;e name was <HI>Nagar.</HI> Before that, it was only a place of Plea&s;ure, where the King had very fair Gardens, till at length his Wife continually repre&s;enting to him the delicacies of the &s;ituation for the building a City and a Palace, by rea&s;on of the River; he laid the foundations, and order'd that it &s;hould bear the name of his Wife, calling it, <HI>Bag-Nagar,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Garden of <HI>Nagar.</HI> This City lies in &s;eventeen degrees of Eleva|tion, wanting two minutes. The Country round about is a &s;lat Country, only neer the City are &s;everal Rocks, as you &s;ee about <HI>Fontain-Bleau.</HI> A great River wa&s;hes the Walls of the City upon the South-we&s;t-&s;ide, which, neer to <HI>Ma&s;lipa|tan,</HI> falls into the Gulf of <HI>Bengala.</HI> At <HI>Bagnagar</HI> you cro&s;s this River over a Bridg no le&s;s beautiful than <HI>Pont-Neuf</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> The City is little le&s;s than <HI>Or|leans,</HI> well-built, and full of Windows. There are many fair large Streets, but not being well-pav'd, they are du&s;ty, as are all the Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> which is very offen&s;ive in the Summer.</P>
<P>Before you come to the Bridg, you mu&s;t pa&s;s through a large Suburb, call'd <HI>Erengabad,</HI> about a league in length; where live all the Merchants, the Brokers, Handicraft-Trades, and in general, all the meaner &s;ort of people; The City being inhabited only by per&s;ons of Quality, Officers of the King's Hou&s;e, Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, and Officers of the Army. From ten or eleven in the foren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">n, till four or five in the evening, the Merchants, Brokers, and Work|men co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> into the City to trade with the Forreign Merchants; after which time they return to their own Hou&s;es. In the are Suburb two or three fair <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> which &s;erve for Inns for the Forreigners, be&s;ides &s;everal Pagods in the Neighbour|ing-parts. Through the &s;ame Suburb lies the way to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Gol|conda.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as you are over the Bridg, you enter into a large Street, that leads you to the King's Palace. On the right-hand are the Hou&s;es of &s;ome Lords of the Court; and four or five Inns two Stories-high: wherein there are fair Halls and large Chambers to let in the fre&s;h Air. At the end of this Street there is a large <HI>Piazza;</HI> upon which &s;tands one of the &s;ides of the Palace; in the middle whereof there is a Balcony, wherein the King comes to &s;it, when he plea&s;es to give Audience to the People. The great Gate of the Palace &s;tands not upon this <HI>Piazza,</HI> but upon another very neer adjoyning; and you enter fir&s;t into a large
<PB N="64" REF="189">
Court &s;urrounded with Portico's, under which lies the King's Guards. Out of this Court you pa&s;s into another, built after the &s;ame form, encompa&s;t with &s;e|veral fair Apartments, the Roofs whereof are terra&s;s'd. Upon which, as upon tho&s;e where the Elephants are kept, there are very fair Gardens, wherein there grow Trees of that bigne&s;s, that it is a thing of great wonder, how tho&s;e Arches &s;hould bear &s;o va&s;t a burthen.</P>
<P>About fifty years &s;ince, they began to build a magnificent Pagod in the City; which would have been the faire&s;t in all <HI>India,</HI> had it been fini&s;h'd. The Stones are to be admir'd for their bigne&s;s: And that wherein the Nich is made, which is on that &s;ide where they &s;ay their Prayers, is an entire Rock, of &s;uch a prodigious bulk, that it was five years before five or &s;ix-hunder'd men, continually employ'd, could hew it out of its place. They were forc'd al&s;o to rowl it along upon an En|gine with Wheels, upon which they brought it to the Pagod; and &s;everal affirm'd to me&punc; that there were fourteen-hunder'd Oxen to draw it. I will tell you here|after the rea&s;on it remains imperfect: For had it been fini&s;h'd, in all rea&s;on it had excell'd all the bolde&s;t Structures of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the City, as you go to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> there are two great Lakes, being each about a league in compa&s;s, wherein there ride &s;everal Pinks richly adorn'd for the King's Plea&s;ure; and upon the Banks are &s;everal fair Hou&s;es that belong to the Principal Lords of the Court.</P>
<P>Upon three &s;ides of the City &s;tands a very fair <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> wherein are the Tombs of the Kings of <HI>Golconda:</HI> and about four in the afternoon there is a Dole of Bread and <HI>Pilau</HI> to all the Poor that come. If you would &s;ee any thing that is rare, you mu&s;t go to view the&s;e Tombs upon a Fe&s;tival-day. For then from morning till night they are hung with rich Tape&s;try.</P>
<P>As for the Government and Policy which is ob&s;erv'd in this City: In the fir&s;t place, when a &s;tranger comes to the Gates, they fearch him exactly, to &s;ee if he have any Salt or Tobacco about him; for tho&s;e Commodities bring the King his greate&s;t Revenue. Sometimes a Stranger &s;hall wait a day or two, before he &s;hall have leave to enter. For a Souldier fir&s;t gives notice to the officer that com|mands the Guard, and then he &s;ends to the <HI>Deroga,</HI> to know what he &s;hall do. Now, becau&s;e it many times happens that the <HI>Deroga</HI> is bu&s;y, or gone to take a walk out of the City, or el&s;e for that &s;ometimes the Souldier him&s;elf pretends he cannot find the <HI>Deroga,</HI> only, to create him&s;elf more errands, to get the more Mo|ney; a Stranger is forc'd to endure all this delay, &s;ometimes, as I have &s;aid before, for a day or two.</P>
<P>When the King &s;its to do Ju&s;tice, I ob&s;erve that he comes into the Balcone that looks into the <HI>Piazza,</HI> and all that have bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tand below, ju&s;t again&s;t the place where the King &s;its. Between the People and the Walls of the Palace are fix'd in the ground three rows of Poles, about the length of an Half-Pike, to the ends whereof they tye certain ropes a-cro&s;s one upon another. Nor is any per&s;on what&s;oever permitted to pa&s;s beyond tho&s;e bounds, unle&s;s he be call'd. This Bar, which is never &s;et up, but when the King &s;its in Judgment, runs along the whole bredth of the <HI>Piazza;</HI> and ju&s;t again&s;t the Balcone there is a Bar to open, to let in tho&s;e that are call'd. Then two men, that each of them hold a Cord by the end, extended all the bredth of the pa&s;&s;age, have nothing to do but to let f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the Cord, for any per&s;on that is call'd to &s;tep over it. A Secretary of Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ts be|low under the bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">one, to receive all Petitions; and when he has five or &s;ix to|gether, he puts them in a Bag, and then an Eunuch, who &s;tands in the Balcone neer the King, lets down a &s;tring, to which the Bag being ty'd, he draws it up, and pre|&s;ents it to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Every Munday the chiefe&s;t of the Nobility mount the Guard, every one in their turn, and are never reliev'd till at the eight days end. There are &s;ome of the&s;e Lords that have five or &s;ix thou&s;and men under their command; and they lye encamp'd in their Tents round about the City. When they mount the Guard, every one goes from his own Habitation to the Rendevouz; but when they are reliev'd, they march in good order over the Bridg, thence through the long Street into the <HI>Piazza,</HI> where they draw up before the Balcone. In the fir&s;t place, march ten or twelve Elephants, more or le&s;s, ac|cording to the quality of the Captain of the Guard. There are &s;ome of the&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="189">
Elephants that carry Cages, which in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;emble the Body of a little Coach; there are others that have but one man to guide them, and another in the Cage who carries a Banner.</P>
<P>After the Elephants, follow the Camels by two and two, &s;ometimes to the number of thirty or forty. Every Camel carries a kind of Pack&s;addle, upon which is fa&s;ten'd a little Culverine, which a certain Engineer, clad in a skin from head to foot, and &s;itting upon the Crupper of the Camel, with a lighted Match in his hand, dextrou&s;ly manages from one &s;ide to another before the Balcone, where the King &s;its.</P>
<P>After them come the Coaches, attended by the Dome&s;tick Servants of the Commander: Next to them follow the lead-Hor&s;es, and then the Lord appears, to whom all this Equipage belongs, attended by ten or twelve Curti&s;ans, that &s;tay for him at the end of the Bridg, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">skip and dance before him to the <HI>Piazza.</HI> Behind him the Cavalry and infantry march in good order: which being a &s;hew, wherein there was much of delight and &s;tate, all the while I &s;taid at <HI>Bagnabar,</HI> which was about four Months, I had the diverti&s;ement to &s;ee them out of my Lodging in the great Street every week as they march'd by.</P>
<P>The Souldiers wear no other Clothes than only three or four ells of Calicut, with which they cover half their Bodies behind and before. They wear their hair very long, and tie it up in a knot upon the top of the crown, like the wo|men, who have no other Headgear than only a piece of Linnen with three cor|ners, one that comes to the middle of the head, and the other two, which they tie under their chins. The Souldiers do not wear Hangers or Scimitars like the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> but broad Swords like the <HI>Switzers,</HI> as well for a thru&s;t, as a blow, which they hang in a Girdle. The Barrels of their Muskets are &s;tronger than ours, and much neater; for their Iron is better, and not &s;o &s;ubject to break. Their Cavalry carry Bows and Arrows, a Buckler and a Battel-Ax, an Headpiece and a Jacket of Mail, that hangs down from the Head-piece over their Shoul|ders.</P>
<P>There are &s;o great a number of common Women as well in the City as in the Suburbs, and in the Fortre&s;s, which is like another City, that there are generally above twenty thou&s;and &s;et down in the <HI>Deroga</HI>'s Book; without which licence, it is not lawful for any Woman to profe&s;s the Trade. They pay no tribute to the King; only they are oblig'd to come, a certain number of them, with their Go|verne&s;s, and their Mu&s;ick every Friday, and pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the Balcone. If the King be there, they dance before him. if he intend not to come, an Eunuch comes into the Balcone, and makes them a &s;ign to retire. In the cool of the evening they &s;tand at the doors of their Hou&s;es, which are for the mo&s;t part little Huts, and when night comes, they &s;et up a Candle or a lighted Lamp for a Signal: Then it is al&s;o that they open all the Shops where they &s;ell <HI>Tari;</HI> which is a cer|tain drink made of the juice of a Tree, and is as Sweet as our new Wines. They fetch it &s;ome five or &s;ix league off, upon Hor&s;es, that carry two earthen-Bottles of each &s;ide, and trot at a great rate; of which there come every day to the City above five or &s;ix hunder'd. This King has a con&s;iderable Revenue by the Impo&s;t which he lays upon this <HI>Tari.</HI> And for that rea&s;on he permits &s;o many common Women, in regard it is for their &s;ake that &s;o much <HI>Tari</HI> is con&s;um'd; tho&s;e that &s;ell it, for that cau&s;e, keeping their Shops by tho&s;e Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ort of Women are &s;o nimble and active, that when the pre&s;ent King went to &s;ee <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> nine of them undertook to repre&s;ent the figure of an Elephant; four making the four feet, four the body, and one the trunk; upon which the King, &s;itting in a kind of Throne, made his entry into the City.</P>
<P>All the Men and Women of <HI>Golconda</HI> are well proportion'd, and of comely, &s;tatures; and fair enough in their countenances; only the Country-people are a little more &s;wart.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King of <HI>Golconda</HI> bears the Name of <HI>Abdoul-Coutou-Sha;</HI> and I will tell the Reader in a few words, from whence he drew his Original. In the Reign of <HI>Axbar</HI> King of <HI>India,</HI> the Father of <HI>Jehan-Guir,</HI> the Territories of the Great <HI>Moguls</HI> did not extend farther Southward then <HI>Narbider;</HI> &s;o that the River which runs by it, and which coming from the South, empties it &s;elf into <HI>Ganges,</HI> &s;eparated their Dominions from the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Nar&s;ingue,</HI> that
<PB N="66" REF="190">
Itretch'd as far as <HI>Cape-Comorin,</HI> the other <HI>Raja's</HI> being only his Subjects and de|pending upon him. This <HI>Raja</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors have been always at Wars with them that &s;ucceeded to <HI>Tamerlane</HI> or <HI>Temur-leng</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> and their Power was &s;o great, that the la&s;t <HI>Raja,</HI> who was at War with <HI>Akbar,</HI> brought into the Field four Armies under as many Generals. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Armies lay in tho&s;e Provinces, which at this day are call'd the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda;</HI> the &s;econd was quarter'd in the Provinces of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the third in the Province of <HI>Dultabat,</HI> and the fourth in the Territories of <HI>Brampour.</HI> The <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Nar&s;ingue</HI> dying without Children, the four Generals divided among them&s;elves the Countries which they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with their Army, and took upon them the title of Kings, the one of <HI>Golcon|da,</HI> the other of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the other of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and the fourth of <HI>Dultabat.</HI> Though the <HI>Raja</HI> were an Idolater, neverthele&s;s his four Generals were <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> and he of <HI>Golconda</HI> was of the Sect of <HI>Haly,</HI> de&s;cended from an Ancient Family of the <HI>Turcomans,</HI> which inhabit the Country of <HI>Hamadan</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This General, as I have &s;aid, was more con&s;iderable than any of the re&s;t; and &s;ome few days after the death of the <HI>Raja,</HI> they won a famous Victory from the <HI>Mogul;</HI> &s;o that he could not hinder them from a&s;&s;uming their &s;everal Sovereignties. But after that, <HI>Jehan-Guir,</HI> the Son of <HI>Akbar,</HI> conquer'd again the Kingdom of <HI>Brampour, Cha-jehan</HI> the Son of <HI>Jehan-Guir</HI> recover'd the Kingdom of <HI>Dultabat,</HI> and <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> the Son of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> recover'd &s;ome part of the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI> As for the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> neither <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> nor <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> di&s;turb'd him, but let him re&s;t in peace, upon condition that he &s;hould pay to the <HI>Mogul</HI> an annual tribute of 200000 Pagods. At pre&s;ent the greate&s;t <HI>Raja</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Ganges</HI> is the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velou,</HI> who&s;e Territories extend to <HI>Cape-Comorin,</HI> and who &s;ucceeded to &s;ome part of the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Nar&s;ingue:</HI> But in regard there is no Trade in his Country, and by con&s;equence no concour&s;e of &s;trangers, there is little notice taken of him. The pre&s;ent King of <HI>Golconda</HI> has no Sons, but three Daughters, who are all married.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t E&s;pous'd one of the Kin&s;men of the <HI>Grand-Chek</HI> of <HI>Mecca.</HI> Nor mu&s;t we forget &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages that fell out before this Marriage. The <HI>Check</HI> coming to <HI>Golconda</HI> in the habit of a <HI>Faquir,</HI> for &s;ome Months lodg'd without the Gate of the Palace, di&s;daining to give any an&s;wer to &s;everal Courtiers, that demanded what his bu&s;ine&s;s was. At length the thing being made known to the King, he &s;ent his chief Phy&s;itian, who &s;poke good <HI>Arabick,</HI> to know of the <HI>Chek</HI> what he had to reque&s;t, and the rea&s;on of his coming. The Phy&s;itian, and &s;ome other Lords of the Court that di&s;cours'd him al&s;o, finding him to be a per&s;on of great Wit and Learning, brought him to the King, who was very well &s;atisfi'd with his a&s;pect and his pre&s;ence. But at length the <HI>Chek</HI> declaring to him, that he came to E&s;pou&s;e the Prince&s;s; that propo&s;al very much &s;urpriz'd the Prince, and was look'd upon by the greate&s;t part of the Court, as made by a per&s;on not well in his wits. At fir&s;t the King only laugh'd at him. But when he found him ob|&s;tinately per&s;evering in his demand, in-&s;o-much that he threatn'd the Countrey with &s;ome &s;trange Calamity, if the Prince&s;s were not given to him in Marriage, he was committed to Pri&s;on, where he lay a long time. At length the King thinking it more to the purpo&s;e to &s;end him back into his own Countrey, caus'd him to be &s;hip'd away at <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el that carri'd Goods and Pilgrims to <HI>Moc|ca,</HI> whence they travel by land to <HI>Mecca.</HI> About two years after the &s;ame <HI>Chek</HI> return'd again to <HI>Golconda,</HI> and order'd his affairs &s;o well, that he E&s;pous'd the Prince&s;s, and won an high reputation in the Kingdom, which he governs at this day, and is very Potent. He it was that kept the King from &s;urrendring the For|tre&s;s of <HI>Golconda,</HI> whither he was retir'd, when <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> and his Son took <HI>Bag|nabar,</HI> as I &s;hall tell you by and by, threatning to kill him, if he would not re&s;olve to hold it out, and not deliver the keys to the enemy. This bold action was the rea&s;on which made the King love him ever afterwards; and that he takes his coun&s;e in all weighty affairs, not as he is the King's Son-in-Law, but as he is a great Mini&s;ter of State, and the chiefe&s;t per&s;on, next the King, in all the Court. He it was that has put a &s;top to the fini&s;hing the great Pagod in <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> having threaten'd the whole Kingdom with &s;ome great Calamity, if they went forward with the work. This Prince is a pa&s;&s;ionate Lover of all tho&s;e that profe&s;s the Mathematicks, and under&s;tands them as well. For which rea&s;on, though he be

a Mahumetan, he is a great Favourer of all the Chri&s;tians, who are vers'd in that Science, as he has particularly te&s;tifi'd to Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> a <HI>Capuchin,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Golconda</HI> for <HI>Pegu,</HI> whither he was &s;ent by his Superiors. He did all he could to oblige him to &s;tay in the Country, and offer'd to build him a Hou&s;e and a Church at his own expences; telling him, he &s;hould neither want employ|ment, nor Hearers, in regard there were &s;everal <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Chri&s;tians, and &s;eve|ral <HI>Armenians</HI> that came thither to trade. But Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> having a particu|lar Order to go to <HI>Pegu,</HI> could not accept of his Offer; yet when he went to take his leave of the <HI>Check,</HI> he pre&s;ented him with a <HI>Calaat,</HI> the mo&s;t noble that was in his Wardrobe; being the whole habit; the Cap, the <HI>Cabay</HI> or large Ve&s;t, the <HI>Arcalou</HI> or &s;hort Ca&s;&s;ock, two pair of Drawers, two Shirts, and two Scarfs, which they wear about their necks, and over their heads to keep off the heat of the Sun. The Friar was &s;urpriz'd at the pre&s;ent, and gave the <HI>Check</HI> to under&s;tand, that it was not proper for him to wear it: however the <HI>Check</HI> would force him to take it, telling him he might accommodate &s;ome of his Friends with it. Two months after Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> be&s;tow'd the &s;ame Pre&s;ent upon me, be|ing at <HI>Surat;</HI> for which I return'd him thanks.</P>
<P>The <HI>Check</HI> &s;eeing he could not detain the Father, and unwilling he &s;hould go a|foot from <HI>Golconda</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> oblig'd him to take an Oxe, with two Men to lead it; and becau&s;e he could not per&s;wade him to take al&s;o thirty Pagods, which he pre&s;ented the Father withall, he commanded the two men, when they came to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> to leave the Oxe and the thirty Pagods with him, which they did very punctually; for otherwi&s;e at their return to <HI>Golconda,</HI> they had forfeited their lives. I will fini&s;h the Hi&s;tory of Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> when I come to the de&s;cription of <HI>Goa,</HI> which is the principal place that the <HI>Portugals</HI> have in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Daughter of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> was married to <HI>Sultan Ma|humad,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Aurengzeb;</HI> the occa&s;ion whereof was this: <HI>Mir|gimola,</HI> Generali&s;&s;imo of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Army, and who had been very &s;erviceable to his Ma&s;ter, to &s;ettle the Crown upon his head, according to the cu&s;tom, left with the King as a mark of his fidelity, both his Wife and Chil|dren in Ho&s;tage; for he was &s;ent to reduce certain <HI>Raja's</HI> in <HI>Bengala,</HI> that were in Rebellion. He had &s;everal Daughters, but only one Son, who had a great train, and made a great noi&s;e at Court. The reputation and riches which <HI>Mir|gimola</HI> had gain'd, rais'd him up &s;everal Enemies, who endeavour'd in his ab|&s;ence to ruine him, and to put him out of the Kings favour. They pretended that the great power of <HI>Mirgimola</HI> was very much to be &s;u&s;pected; that all his de&s;igns tended to dethrone him, and to &s;ettle the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> up|o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his own Son; that it behov'd him not to &s;tay till the remedy were pa&s;t cure, but to rid him&s;elf of an Enemy, &s;o much the more to be fear'd, the clo&s;er he kept his intentions; and that the &s;horte&s;t and be&s;t way was to poy&s;on him. The King being ea&s;ily per&s;waded, gave them leave and authority to act as they pleas'd for his &s;ecurity; but having mi&s;s'd of their de&s;ign for three or four times together, <HI>Mirgimola's</HI> Son began to &s;mell the plot; and immediately gave advice thereof to his Father. It is not known what in&s;tructions he receiv'd from his Father; but &s;o &s;oon as he had his an&s;wer, he went to the King, and &s;poke boldly to him, taxing him with the &s;ervices which his Father had done him, and that without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had never come to the Crown. The young Lord, naturally of a fiery di&s;po&s;ition, kept on this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the King, till at length his Maje&s;ty flung away; and the Lords that were pre&s;ent, fell upon the young man, and ba&s;ely mi&s;us'd him. At the &s;ame time al&s;o he was arre&s;ted and committed to pri&s;on, together with his Mother and Si&s;ters. Which action, as it made a great noi&s;e at Court, coming to <HI>Mirgimola's</HI> ears, &s;o in|cens'd him, that having an Army under his command, and being belov'd by the Soldiers, he re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of the advantages he had, to revenge him|&s;elf for the injury done him. He was then not far from <HI>Bengala,</HI> being &s;ent, as I &s;aid before, to reduce certain <HI>Raja's</HI> to obedience, who&s;e Territories lye upon the <HI>Ganges;</HI> and <HI>Sultan-Sujah, Cha-jehan</HI>'s &s;econd Son, being then Gover|nour of <HI>Bengala,</HI> the General thought it his be&s;t way to addre&s;s him&s;elf to him; as being the next Prince, with whom he might join his Forces again&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="191">
the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> whom he look'd upon now no more as his Ma&s;ter, but as one of his mo&s;t inveterate Enemies. Thereupon he wrote to the Prince to this effect: That if he would join with him, he would give him an opportu|nity to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Golconda;</HI> and that he &s;hould not neglect &s;o fair an opportunity to enlarge the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mo|gul,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion whereof might as well concern him, as any of the re&s;t of his Brothers. But the an&s;wer which <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> &s;ent him, was contrary to his expectation; who told him, that he could not tell how to tru&s;t a per&s;on, who as he went about to betray his King, might more ea&s;ily be drawn to be|tray a Foreign Prince, whom he had inveigl'd only for the &s;ake of his Re|venge; and that therefore he &s;hould not rely upon him. Upon <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI>'s refu&s;al, <HI>Mirgimola</HI> wrote to <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> who was then in his Government of <HI>Brampoure,</HI> who being not &s;o nice as his Brother, accepted of the propo&s;al that was made him. Thus while <HI>Mirgimola</HI> advanc'd with his Troops toward <HI>Bag|nabar, Aurengzeb</HI> ha&s;ten's toward <HI>Decan,</HI> and both Armies being join'd, they came to the Gates of <HI>Bagnabar</HI> before the King was in a po&s;ture to receive them. He had only time to retreat into his Fortre&s;s of <HI>Golconda,</HI> to which <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> after he had rifl'd the City of <HI>Bagnabar,</HI> and plunder'd the Palace, lay'd a clo&s;e Siege. The King &s;eeing him&s;elf thus vigorou&s;ly pre&s;s'd, &s;ent away to <HI>Mirgimola</HI> his Wife and Children very honourably. For there is vertue and genero&s;ity in the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Europeans;</HI> of which I will give you an illu&s;trious Example in the per&s;on of the King of <HI>Golconda.</HI> Some days after the Enemy had be&s;ieg'd the Fortre&s;s, a Canoneer e&s;pying <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> upon his Elephant, riding about to view the Fortifications of the Ca&s;tle, told the King, being then upon the Ba&s;tion, that if he pleas'd he would fetch off <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> with a Canon-&s;hot; and at the &s;ame time was about to give fire; but the King holding his hand, told him he perceiv'd it well enough, but that it behov'd Kings to be better Husbands of the Lives of Princes. The Canoneer obey'd the King, and in&s;tead of &s;hooting at <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> he took off the Head of the General of his Army, who was a little before him; which put a &s;top to the A&s;&s;ault they were about to have giv'n, the Army being in a confu&s;ion upon his death. <HI>Abdul-jaber-Beg,</HI> General of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Army, lying not far from the Camp, with a flying Army of four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, under&s;tanding the di&s;order of the Enemy by rea&s;on of the lo&s;s of their General, laid hold of &s;o favourable an opportunity, gave them a de&s;perate charge in that confu&s;ion, and putting them to the rout, per&s;u'd them till night, for four or five Leagues. Some few days before the General's death, the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> finding that his provi&s;ions fail'd him in the Fortre&s;s, was about to have deliver'd the Keys; but as I &s;aid before, <HI>Mirza-Mahomed,</HI> his Son-in-Law, &s;natch'd them out of his hand, and threatned to kill him, if he per&s;ever'd in that re&s;olution. Which was the rea&s;on, that the King who lov'd him not before&punc; had ever after the greate&s;t affection imaginable for him as long as he liv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Aurengzeb</HI> being thus con&s;train'd to rai&s;e his Siege, &s;tay'd &s;ome days to rally his Troops; and having receiv'd a recruit of fre&s;h men, return'd again to the Siege, with new re&s;olutions. But <HI>Mirgimola,</HI> who had &s;till &s;ome kindne&s;s for the King remaining in his brea&s;t, would not permit <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> to u&s;e the ut|mo&s;t extremity, but by his wit and good management gain'd a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> the Father of <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> had formerly had great kindne&s;&s;es &s;hew'n him by the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> to whom he fled after he had lo&s;t the Battel, together with his elde&s;t Brother, which he fought again&s;t <HI>Jehan-guir</HI> his Father, with whom he made War. The elde&s;t Son was taken, and <HI>Jehan-guir</HI> caus'd his eyes to be put out; but <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> being more wary, fled, and was entertain'd by the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> with whom he enter'd into a particular and &s;trict friend&s;hip; <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> making an Oath to his Benefactor, that he would never wage War again&s;t him upon any occa&s;ion whatever. <HI>Mirgimola</HI> there|fore knowing that it would be no difficult thing to bring two Kings, that were Friends, to an accommodation, wrought underhand with both, toward the con|clu&s;ion of a Peace. And he &s;o brought his bu&s;ine&s;s about, that the King of <HI>Gol|conda</HI> writ a Letter fir&s;t to <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> wherein he &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively reque&s;ted him
 
<PB N="69" REF="191">
to be an Arbitrator between <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> and him, promi&s;ing to &s;ubmit wholly to him, and to &s;ign &s;uch Articles as he &s;hould propo&s;e. By the &s;ame policy of <HI>Mir|gimola, Cha-jehan</HI> was advis'd, in an&s;wer to the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Letter to pro|po&s;e a Match between his &s;econd Daughter and <HI>Sultan Mahomed,</HI> the Son of <HI>Au|rengzeb,</HI> upon condition that after the death of the King her Father, the Son-in-Law &s;hould inherit the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda.</HI> This propo&s;ition being accepted, the Peace was concluded, and the Nuptials celebrated with an extraordinary Magnificence. As for <HI>Mirgimola,</HI> he quitted the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and went with <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> to <HI>Brampour.</HI> Soon after <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> made him his Prime Mini&s;ter of State, and Generali&s;&s;imo of his Armies; and he it was that &s;o potently a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> to get the Crown, by the defeat of <HI>Sultan-Sujah.</HI> For <HI>Mirgimola</HI> was a per&s;on of great wit, and no le&s;s under&s;tanding in Military than in State affairs. I had occa&s;ion to &s;peak with him &s;everal times; and I have no le&s;s admir'd his ju&s;tice, than his di&s;patch to all people that had to do with him; while he gave out &s;everal Orders, and &s;ign'd &s;everal Di&s;patches at the &s;ame time, as if he had but one entire bu&s;ine&s;s in hand.</P>
<P>The other Prince&s;s of <HI>Golconda</HI> was promis'd to <HI>Sultan Sejed,</HI> another <HI>Chek</HI> of <HI>Mecca;</HI> and the Match went on &s;o fairly, that the day was appointed for the ce|lebration of the Nuptials; but <HI>Abdoul-Jaber-Beg,</HI> General of the Army, with &s;ix other Lords, went to the King to divert him from his intention; and they brought it &s;o to pa&s;s, that the Match was broken off, and the Prince&s;s was given in Mar|riage to <HI>Mirza-Abdoul-Cofing,</HI> the Kings Cou&s;in; by whom &s;he has two Sons, which have wholly annull'd the Preten&s;ions of <HI>Aurengzeb</HI>'s Son; who&s;e Father now keeps him in Pri&s;on, in the Fort of <HI>Gavaleor,</HI> for having taken his Uncle <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI>'s part again&s;t him. The Prince&s;s had been given before to <HI>Mirza-Abdoul-Cofing,</HI> but for his debauchery, which render'd him little regarded by the King. But &s;ince his marriage he is very much reclaim'd.</P>
<P>Now the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> does not &s;tand in &s;o much fear of the <HI>Moguls;</HI> for in imitation of them, he keeps his Money in his own Country, and has already hoarded up a Trea&s;ury &s;ufficient to maintain his Wars. Be&s;ides, he is altogether addicted to the Sect of <HI>Haly,</HI> &s;o that he will not wear a Bonner, like the other <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;ay <HI>Haly</HI> wore none; but another &s;ort of attire for the head. Which is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> that come into <HI>India</HI> to &s;eek their fortune, apply them&s;elves rather to the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> then to the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> Such is the condition of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> al&s;o, whom the Queen, Si|&s;ter to the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> takes care to educate in the Sect of <HI>Haly,</HI> which in|vites great numbers of <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> into her Service.</P>

<P>FRom <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> they count it an hundred <HI>co&s;tes</HI> or leagues, taking the right way. But if you go by the <HI>Diamond-Mine,</HI> which in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language is call'd <HI>Coulour,</HI> in the <HI>Indian, Gani;</HI> they reckon it an hundred and twelve leagues: and this is the Road which I generally took.</P>
<P>From <HI>Golconda</HI> to <HI>Tenara,</HI> co&s;tes</P>
<P><HI>Tenara</HI> is a &s;weet place, where there are four very fair Hou&s;es, to every one of which belongs a large Garden. One of the four &s;tanding upon the left hand along the High-way, is much more beautiful then any of the other three. It is built of Free-&s;tone two &s;tories high, wherein there are &s;everal fair Galleries, Halls, Par|lors, and lodging-Chambers. Before the front of the Hou&s;e is a large four-&s;quare <HI>Piazza,</HI> little inferior to the <HI>Place Royale</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> Upon every one of the other three fronts there is a great Portal, on each &s;ide whereof there is a fair Platform rais'd from the earth above four or five-foot-high, and well-Arch'd, where Tra|vellers of Quality are lodg'd. On the top of each Portal there is a &s;trong Ba|lu&s;ter,
<PB N="70" REF="192">
and a little Chamber for the Ladies. When Per&s;ons of Quality care not to be in their Hou&s;es, they &s;et up Tents in their Gardens; and you mu&s;t take notice that there is no dwelling for any per&s;on but only in the three Hou&s;es; for the fourth, which is the faire&s;t, belongs only to the Queen. When &s;he is not there however, any body may &s;ee it, and take a walk in the Garden, which is a very lovely place, and well-&s;tor'd with water. The whole <HI>Piazza</HI> is encompa&s;t with &s;everal Chambers for the lodging of poor Travellers; who every day to|ward the evening have an Alms be&s;tow'd upon them, of Rice, or Pul&s;e, which they boil ready to their hands. But for the Idolaters that eat nothing which is provided by other hands, they give them flower to make Bread, and a little But|ter. For when their Bread is bak'd like a broad thin Cake, they dip it in the melted-Butter.</P>

The Captains do not give above &s;ix Crowns to every Souldier for the whole &s;ix months that they are u&s;ually out at Sea: Then the Souldiers may return home, and if their Captains will have them &s;tay longer, they mu&s;t allow &punc;em more pay. They &s;eldom venture out above 20 or 25 leagues at Sea, which is no great hazard of the Ve&s;&s;el. But &s;ometimes the <HI>Portugue&s;e's</HI> &s;nap them, and then they either hang 'em up pre&s;ently, or throw 'em over-board. The&s;e <HI>Malavares</HI> carry &s;ometimes 200, &s;ometimes 250 men, and they &s;ail together in Squadrons of ten or fifteen Barques to attack a great Ve&s;&s;el, not caring a ru&s;h for the great Guns. They come board and board &s;o &s;uddenly, and ca&s;t &s;uch a quantity of Pots of Artificial Fire upon the deck, that if there be not &s;peedy remedy appli'd, they will pre&s;ently do a world of mi&s;chief. Generally our Seamen, knowing the cu&s;tom of the&s;e Pirats, when they come within ken, pre&s;ently &s;hut up the Scuttles, and fill the deck with water, to hinder the Fire-Pots from doing execution.</P>
<P>An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, who&s;e name was Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> coming from <HI>Bantam</HI> to <HI>Su|rat,</HI> not far from <HI>Cochin,</HI> met a Squadron of the&s;e <HI>Malavares,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 25 or 30 of the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ques. Who came board and board, and vigorou&s;ly attack'd him. The Captain &s;eeing he could not with&s;tand their fir&s;t Fury, put fire to &s;ome Bar|rels of Powder, and blowing up the deck, blew a great number of the Pirats into the Sea. Neverthele&s;s, the re&s;t were nothing di&s;courag'd, but boarded the Ship a &s;econd time. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain &s;eeing there was no help, put his men into two Shallops, and &s;taying behind in his Cabin, where the Pirats could not enter &s;o &s;uddenly, he &s;et fire to a Train which he had laid, that reach'd to all the re&s;t of the Powder, and at the &s;ame time leaping into the Sea, was taken up by his own men. In the mean time the Ship being all a-fire, the Pyrats leapt into the Sea al&s;o. But for all this, the two Shallops, wherein there were about forty <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> were taken by the re&s;t of the <HI>Malavares,</HI> that were Fre&s;h-men; and I was then at breakfa&s;t with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, Mr. <HI>Fremelin,</HI> when he receiv'd a Letter from Captain <HI>Clark,</HI> that he was a Slave to <HI>Samorin,</HI> who is the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble King all along the Pirats Coa&s;t. The Prince would not leave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the hands of tho&s;e Scoundrels, knowing that they would have been in great dan|ger of their lives, by rea&s;on that above twelve-hunder'd Women had lo&s;t their Husbands, in the two times that the &s;hip had been fir'd. However the King
<PB N="72" REF="193">
found a means to appea&s;e them, promi&s;ing to each of them that had lo&s;t their Husbands two <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> every <HI>Pia&s;ter</HI> being four &s;hillings apiece, which came to above two thou&s;and four hundred Crowns, be&s;ides four thou&s;and, which were to be paid for the Ran&s;om of the Captain and the other Sea-men, immediately the Pre&s;ident &s;ent the Money, and I &s;aw them at their return, &s;ome in health, others in violent Feavers. The <HI>Malavares</HI> are a People &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that they never touch any thing that is foul or &s;oyl'd, with their Right Hands, but only with the Left, the Nails of which Fingers they let grow, and u&s;e in&s;tead of Combs, for they wear their Hair long like the Women, tying it about their Heads in wreaths, and binding it with a Linnen cloath with three corners.</P>
<P>Since I have mention'd <HI>Daman,</HI> I will tell you in a few words how that City was be&s;ieg'd by <HI>Aureng-Zeb</HI> the pre&s;ent Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> Some are of opinion that Elephants do great matters in War; which may&punc; be &s;ometimes true, but not al|ways; for very often in&s;tead of doing mi&s;chief to the Enemy, they turn upon tho&s;e that Iead them, and rout their own party as <HI>Aureng-Zeb</HI> found by experi|ence, at the Siege of this City. He was twenty days before <HI>Daman,</HI> and re|&s;olv'd at length to Storm it upon a Sunday, believing that the Chri&s;tians were like the Jews and would not defend it upon that day. He that commanded the Place was an old Souldier, who had &s;erv'd in <HI>France,</HI> and had three Sons with him. In the Town were eight hundred Gentlemen, and other &s;tout Souldiers, who came from all parts to &s;ignalize their valour at that Siege. For though the <HI>Mogul</HI> had in his Army above forty thou&s;and men, he could not hinder relief from being put into <HI>Daman</HI> by Sea, in regard that he wanted Ships: The Sun|day that the Prince intended to Storm, the Governour of <HI>Daman,</HI> as had been or|der'd at the Councel of War, caus'd Ma&s;s to be &s;aid pre&s;ently after Midnight, and then made a Sally with all his Cavalry and &s;ome part of his Infantry, who were to fall on upon that quarter which was guarded by two hundred Elephants. Among tho&s;e Elephants they flung a great number of Fire-works which &s;o af|frighted them in the dark of the Night, that knowing not whither they went, nor being to be rul'd by their Governours, they turn'd upon the Be&s;iegers with &s;o much fury, that in le&s;s than two or three hours half the Army of <HI>Aureng-Zeb</HI> was cut in pieces, and in three days the Siege was rais'd; nor would the Prince after that, have any more to do with the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I made two Voyages to <HI>Goa,</HI> the one at the beginning of the year 1641. the &s;econd at the beginning of the year 1648. The fir&s;t time I &s;tay'd but five days, and return'd by Land to <HI>Surat.</HI> From <HI>Goa</HI> I went to <HI>Bicholly,</HI> which is upon the main Land, thence to <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> thence to <HI>Golconda,</HI> thence to <HI>Aureng-abat,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Surat.</HI> I could have gone to <HI>Surat</HI> without pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Golconda,</HI> but my bu&s;ine&s;s led me that way.</P>

<P><HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> is a great &s;cambling City, wherein there is nothing remarkable, nei|ther as to the publick Edifices, nor as to Trade. The Kings Palace is a va&s;t one but ill built; and the acce&s;s to it is very dangerous, in regard there are abun|dance of Crocodiles that lie in the Water which encompa&s;s it. The King of <HI>Vi|&s;apour</HI> has three good ports in his Dominions, <HI>Rejapour, Daboult,</HI> and <HI>Cra-paten.</HI> The la&s;t is the be&s;t of all, where the Sea beats upon the foot of the Mountain, and you have fourteen or fifteen Fathom Water near the Land. Upon the top of the Mountain there is a Fort, with a Spring of Water in it. <HI>Crapaten</HI> is not above five days journey from <HI>Goa</HI> to the North. And <HI>Rabaque,</HI> where the King of <HI>Vi&s;a|pour</HI> &s;els his Pepper, is as far di&s;tant from it to the Ea&s;t. The King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> have been formerly tributary to the Great <HI>Mogul:</HI> but now they are ab&s;olute of them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="193">
This Kingdom was for &s;ome time di&s;quieted by the revolt of <HI>Nair-&s;eva-gi,</HI> Cap|tain of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI>'s Guards; after which the young <HI>Seva-gi</HI> his Son conceiv'd &s;o deadly a hatred again&s;t the King, that he made him&s;elf the head of certain <HI>Banditi,</HI> and as he was both wi&s;e and liberal, he got together &s;o many Hor&s;e and Foot, as made a Compleat Army; the Souldiers flocking to him from all parts, for the reputation of his Liberality. And he was ju&s;t about to have led them to action, when the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> happen'd to dye without Children, &s;o that with little or no trouble he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavar;</HI> taking <HI>Rejapour, Ra&s;igar, Crapaten, Da|boul;</HI> and other places. They report that upon his demoli&s;hing the fortifica|tions&punc;of <HI>Ra&s;igar,</HI> he found va&s;t Trea&s;ures, which help'd him to pay his Soul|diers, who were always well paid. Some years before the death of the King, the Queen perceiving no probability, of having any Children, adopted a little Boy, upon whom &s;he be&s;tow'd all her affections, and cau&s;ed him to be brought up in the Doctrine of <HI>Haly</HI>'s Sect. The King upon his Death-bed caus'd this Adopted Son to be Proclaim'd King; but <HI>Seva-gi</HI> having a nume|rous Army continu'd the War, and much di&s;turb'd the Regency of the Queen. At length he made the fir&s;t propo&s;itions for Peace; which was concluded upon conditions, that he &s;hould quietly enjoy the Territories which he had &s;ubdu'd; that he &s;hould become Tributary to the King, and pay him the half of all his Revenue. The young King being thus fix'd in his Throne, the Queen Regent went in Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> and I was at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> when &s;he pa&s;s'd through the Town in her return home.</P>
<P>When I made my &s;econd Voyage to <HI>Goa,</HI> I embark'd in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el call'd the <HI>Mae&s;tritch,</HI> which carry'd me to <HI>Mingrela,</HI> where I landed the eleventh day of <HI>January,</HI> 1648.</P>
<P><HI>Mingrela</HI> is a large Town, extended half a League in length upon the Sea, in the Territories of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI> It is one of the be&s;t Roads in all <HI>India,</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> take in fre&s;h Provi&s;ions every time they &s;ail to block up <HI>Goa,</HI> as al&s;o when they are bound upon Trade for many other parts of <HI>India.</HI> For at <HI>Mingrela</HI> there is both excellent Water, and excellent Rice. This Town is al&s;o very famous for <HI>Cardamoms,</HI> which the Ea&s;tern people e&s;teem the be&s;t of Spices, not being to be had in any other Country; which makes that &s;ort of Commodity very &s;carce and very dear. There is al&s;o made great &s;tore of cour&s;e Calecuts, that are &s;pent in the Country; be&s;ides great quantities of cour&s;e Matting, that &s;erves to pack up goods. So that both in re&s;pect of Trade, as al&s;o for the furni&s;hing their &s;hips with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> have a Factory in the Town. For, as I &s;aid before, not only all Ve&s;|&s;els that come from <HI>Batavia,</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> from <HI>Bengala, Ceylan,</HI> and other places, and tho&s;e that are bound for <HI>Surat,</HI> the <HI>Red Sea, Ormus, Bal&s;ara,</HI> &amp;c. both going and coming, come to an Anchor in the Road of <HI>Mingrela,</HI> but al&s;o while the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are at Wars with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and lye before the Bar of <HI>Goa,</HI> where they have u&s;ually eight or ten Sail, they &s;end their &s;mall Barks to <HI>Mingrela</HI> for Provi&s;ions. For the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lye eight months in a year before the mouth of the Port of <HI>Goa</HI> &s;o that there can nothing pa&s;s in to <HI>Goa</HI> by Sea all that time. You mu&s;t al&s;o take notice, that the Bar of <HI>Goa</HI> is al&s;o &s;topt up &s;ome part of the year by the Sands which the South and We&s;t-winds that precede the great Rains, ca&s;t up; &s;o that there is not a|bove a foot, or a foot and half Water for very &s;mall Boats. But when the great Rains come, the Water &s;wells and carrying away the Sands, opens a pa&s;&s;age for the great Ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ob&s;ervations upon the pre&s;ent State of the City of <HI>Goa.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>GOA</HI> lies in 15 Degrees, 32 minutes of Latitude, in an I&s;land &s;ix or &s;even leagues about, upon the River of <HI>Mandoua,</HI> ten leagues from the mouth of the River. The I&s;land abounds in Corn and Rice, and bears &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit, as <HI>Manga's, Anana's, Adam</HI>'s-<HI>Figs,</HI> and <HI>Coco's.</HI> But mo&s;t certainly a Pippin is far beyond all tho&s;e fruits. All tho&s;e that have &s;een <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> agree with me, that the Port of <HI>Goa,</HI> the Port of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Toulon,</HI> are three of the faire&s;t Ports of all our va&s;t Continent. The City is very large, and the Walls are of good Stone. The Hou&s;es are for the mo&s;t part very magni|ficently built, e&s;pecially the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI>'s Palace. There are in it a great number of Apartments, and in one part of the Rooms and Chambers, which are very large hang &s;everal Pictures, wherein are &s;everally painted by them&s;elves, the Ships that come from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> with tho&s;e that are bound from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with the name of the Ve&s;&s;el, the Captain, and the number of Guns which the Ship carries. If the City were not &s;o clo&s;ely environ'd with Hills, it would doubtle&s;s be better inhabited, and the air would be much more whol&s;om. But the&s;e Mountains keep off the cool winds, which is the rea&s;on that the heats are very exce&s;&s;ive. Beef and Pork is the ordinary diet of the Inhabitants of <HI>Goa.</HI> They have good &s;tore of Poultry, and &s;ome few Pidgons; but though <HI>Goa</HI> be very neer the Sea, Fi&s;h is very &s;carce. They have abundance of all &s;orts of Sweet-meats, and feed upon them uery mvch.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had brought down the power of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>India</HI> there was nothing to be &s;een at <HI>Goa,</HI> but Magnificence and Riches: but the <HI>Dutch</HI> having every where got their Trade out of their hands, they have lo&s;t their &s;prings of Gold and Silver, and are fallen from their former &s;plendor. In my fir&s;t Voyage to <HI>Goa</HI> I met with people of fa&s;hion, that had above two-thou&s;and Crowns Revenue; at my &s;econd Voyage the &s;ame per&s;ons came privately to me in the evening, to beg an Alms; yet abating nothing, for all that of their inherent pride and haughtine&s;s: Nay, their Women will come in <HI>Palleki's</HI> to the door, and &s;tay while a Boy, that attends them, has brought you a Complement from his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Then u&s;ually you &s;end them what you plea&s;e, or carry it your &s;elf, if you have a curio&s;ity to &s;ee their faces; which rarely can be done, becau&s;e they cover them|&s;elves with a veil from head to foot. Moreover, if you go your &s;elf to pre&s;ent them your Charity, they will give you a little note, containing a recommendation of &s;ome religious Per&s;on, who &s;ignifies what &s;ub&s;tantial per&s;ons they have been, and how they came to fall to decay. Sometimes, if the per&s;on be hand&s;om, &s;he is de&s;ir'd to walk in; and to take a Collation, which la&s;ts mo&s;t commonly till the next day. Had not the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;o many Fortre&s;&s;es to keep upon the Land; or had, they not, out of their contempt of the <HI>Hollander</HI> neglected their affairs, they could never have been reduc'd to &s;o low a condition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have no &s;ooner made the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI> but they are all <HI>Fidalgues</HI> or Gentlemen; and add the Title of <HI>Dom</HI> to the &s;ingle name of <HI>Pedro</HI> or <HI>Jeronimo,</HI> which they receiv'd at their Bapti&s;m: From whence they are call'd the <HI>Fidalgues</HI> or Gentlemen of the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope.</HI> As they change their Names, they al&s;o change their Nature; for it may be truly &s;aid, that the <HI>Indian-Portugals</HI> are the mo&s;t revengeful per&s;ons and the mo&s;t jealous of their Wives of any per&s;ons in the World. And when the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pition creeps into their noddles, they rid them&s;elves of them either by Poi&s;on or Dagger. If they have an ene|my, they never pardon him; but if he be a per&s;on of that courage that they dare not grapple with him, their per&s;ons have attending upo them a &s;ort of black Slaves, that if they command them to kill any one, the Slaves will do it with a blind obe|dience; which they do either with a Dagger, or a Pi&s;tol, or el&s;e by knocking the party on the head with a club, which they always carry, about the length of an Half-Pike. If it happen that they &s;tay too long before they can meet with an op|portunity
<PB N="75" REF="194">
ere they can di&s;patch their mi&s;chief; and that they cannot conveniently meet the per&s;on to be murther'd, in the Fields or in the City, they are no &s;uch Saints, but they will kill him at the very Alter, while he is at his devotions; of which I &s;aw two fatal pre&s;idents, the one at <HI>Goa,</HI> the other at <HI>Daman.</HI> At <HI>Daman</HI> three or four of the&s;e black Slaves perceiving &s;ome per&s;ons whom they were to murther, at Ma&s;s in the Church, di&s;charg'd their Mu&s;quets at them through the windows, never con&s;idering what other mi&s;chief they might do to any other per&s;ons, again&s;t whom they had no quarrel or de&s;ign. The &s;ame thing happen'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> where &s;even men were kill'd clo&s;e by the Alter, and the Prie&s;t that &s;aid Ma&s;s was dangerou&s;ly wounded at the &s;ame time. Nor do their Courts of Ju&s;tice take any cognizance of the&s;e crimes, for generally the guilty per&s;ons are the chiefe&s;t of the Countrey. As for their Suits of Law, there is no end of them, for they are manag'd by the <HI>Canarins,</HI> who are Natives of the Countrey, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to follow the Law; the mo&s;t &s;ubtil and crafty &s;ort of people in the World.</P>
<P>To return to the ancient Power of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> mo&s;t certain it is, that if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had never come among them, you &s;hould not have &s;een a bit of Iron in any <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchant's Hou&s;e; but all Gold or Silver; for they needed no more than to make three or four Voyages to <HI>Japan,</HI> the <HI>Philippin,</HI> or <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, or to <HI>China</HI> to enrich them&s;elves; gaining at their return above five or &s;ix for one one upon rich Merchandizes. The very Souldiers as well as the Captains and Governors enrich'd them&s;elves by Trade. There was not any per|&s;on, unle&s;s it be the Governor, who was not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rader; or if he does Trade, it is in another man's name, for he has Revenue enough without it. Formerly it was one of the fine&s;t employments of the World to be <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Goa:</HI> and there are but few Monarchs, that have Governments at their di&s;po&s;al, which are equal in value to &s;ome of tho&s;e which depend upon this <HI>Vice-Roy.</HI> The chief Command is that of <HI>Mozambique</HI> for three years. In tho&s;e three years the Governor gets above four or five hunder'd-thou&s;and Crowns, and &s;ometimes more, if in all that time they receive no lo&s;&s;es from the <HI>Cafres.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> are people that bring Gold for the Commodities which they carry away; and if any one of them happen to dye, going or coming, whatever you tru&s;ted them withall is lo&s;t with|out redemption. The Governour of <HI>Mozambique</HI> trades al&s;o with the Negro's that inhabit all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Melinda;</HI> and they ordinarily pay for the goods they buy, either in Elephants Teeth, or Ambergree&s;e. When I was la&s;t in <HI>Goa,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> who return'd to <HI>Goa</HI> after he had been three years in his Command, had by him only in Ambergree&s;e, two hundred thou&s;and Crowns, not reckoning his Gold, and his Elephants Teeth, which a|mounted to a far larger &s;um.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Government was that of <HI>Malaca,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Cu&s;tom which was there to be paid. For it is a Streight through which all Ve&s;&s;els that are bound from <HI>Goa,</HI> for <HI>Japon, China, Cochinchina, Java, Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> the <HI>Phillippin</HI> I&s;lands, and many other places, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity pa&s;s. They may &s;ail another way by the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> toward the We&s;t, and &s;o through the Streight of <HI>Sonde,</HI> or el&s;e leave the I&s;land of <HI>Java</HI> to the North; but when the Ships return to <HI>Goa,</HI> they mu&s;t &s;hew a di&s;charge from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e of <HI>Malaca,</HI> which obliges them to go that way.</P>
<P>The third Government is that of <HI>Ormus,</HI> by rea&s;on of the great Trade which is there, and the Cu&s;tom which all Ships are to pay that are bound in and out of the <HI>Per&s;ian Golf.</HI> The Governour of <HI>Ormus</HI> exacted great Tolls from tho&s;e that went to the I&s;land of <HI>Bakren</HI> to fi&s;h for Pearls, for if they did not take a Licence from him, he would &s;ink their Ve&s;&s;els. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> at pre&s;ent exact this Cu&s;tom from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have a &s;mall &s;hare in that Trade, as I have related in my <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Voyages. But though they are &s;evere enough to the Merchants, their Cu&s;toms amount to nothing neer &s;o much as what the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI> made of it. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are in the &s;ame condition at <HI>Malaca,</HI> not re|ceiving hardly &s;ufficient to pay their Garri&s;on which they keep there.</P>
<P>The fourth Government is that of <HI>Mo&s;cate,</HI> the revenue whereof was very great. For all Ve&s;&s;els that are bound from <HI>India,</HI> from the <HI>Per&s;ian Golf,</HI> from the Red Sea, and from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Melinda,</HI> mu&s;t come under the Point of
<PB N="76" REF="195">
<HI>Mu&s;cate,</HI> where they generally take in fre&s;h Water. If there be any Ships that would not come to an Anchor there, the Governour &s;ent for his Cu&s;tom, which was four in the hundred; and if they refus'd, the Governour had his Galea&s;&s;es ready to &s;ink them.</P>
<P>The fifth Government was that of the &s;land of <HI>Ceyland,</HI> to which belong'd all tho&s;e places whcih the <HI>Portugals</HI> had, as well upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavar</HI> the Golf of <HI>Bengala,</HI> and other parts of <HI>India;</HI> the wor&s;t of which employ|ments was worth ten thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e five great Governments, which were at the di&s;po&s;al of the Vice-Roy, he had abundance of other Offices in his Gift, as well in <HI>Goa,</HI> as in other parts of <HI>India.</HI> The very day that he makes his Entry into <HI>Goa,</HI> the Captain of his Guards gets above four thou&s;and Crowns. The three Offices of Engi|neer Major, Vi&s;itor of the Forts, and chief Ma&s;ter of the Ordinance, yielded every year twenty thou&s;and <HI>Pardo</HI>'s; every <HI>Pardo</HI> being worth twenty-&s;even Sous of our Money. The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> were then all very rich; the Nobility by rea&s;on of their Governments and Commands, the Merchants by their Trade, till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> cut them &s;hort. When they had <HI>Ormus,</HI> they would not let any Merchant pa&s;s by Sea into <HI>India;</HI> &s;o that they were forc'd to go by Land through <HI>Candahar.</HI> Then, when the <HI>Turky, Per&s;ian, Arabian, Mu&s;covits, Polonian,</HI> and other Merchants arriv'd at <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;y,</HI> they join'd together, and deputed four of the mo&s;t experienc'd per&s;ons among them, to view all the &s;orts of Commodities, and to under&s;tand their quality and price. After they have made their report, they agree upon their price, and fetch away thier goods, which are di&s;tributed to every one proportionably according to the number of Merchants. It is al&s;o the cu&s;tom of all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that there is nothing &s;old, but a Bro|ker has a hand in the Bargain. They make good the Money to tho&s;e that have &s;old, and receive it from them that buy; and there are &s;ome &s;orts of Commodities upon which there is due to them for Brokage, &s;ometimes one in the Hundred, &s;ometime one and a half, and two.</P>
<P>At that time the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> made great profit, without any lo&s;s. For the Vice-Roy took care to pre&s;erve them again&s;t the Pyrats. Who a&s;&s;oon as the Rains are over, and that it was &s;ea&s;onably to put to Sea, always &s;ent a &s;uffi|cient convoy to guard the Merchants twenty-five or thirty Leagues to Sea, the <HI>Malvares</HI> not daring to &s;tir above fifteen or twenty. The Captains of the Galiots, and the Soldiers drive a &s;mall Trade al&s;o in their Voyages, and in re|gard they pay no cu&s;tom, they gain enough to maintain them&s;elves hand&s;ome|ly all the time they lye in Garri&s;on, which is during the Rains. There was al&s;o care taken for the advancement of the Soldiery; for every Soldier that came from <HI>Portugal,</HI> after nine years &s;ervice, had &s;ome Command either by Sea or Land be&s;tow'd upon him; and if he would not accept of it, they gave him leave to Trade as a Merchant. So that if there happen'd to be any per&s;on of under&s;tanding among them, he could not fail, to rai&s;e his fortune, having all the credit he could de&s;ire. For there were people enough that being glad to let out their Money, would venture with him at <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> upon his re|turn. If the Ve&s;&s;el be lo&s;t, they that lend their Money, lo&s;e either their Money or their goods; but if the Ship come &s;afe home, of one they make three or four.</P>
<P>The Natives of the Country, call'd <HI>Canarins,</HI> are not permitted to bear any Offices among the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> but only in reference to the Law, that is to &s;ay, either as Advocates, or Sollicitors, or Scriveners; for they keep them very much under. If one of the&s;e <HI>Canarins</HI> or Blacks, happen to &s;trike a White or <HI>European,</HI> there is no pardon for him, but he mu&s;t have his hand cut off. As well the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> make u&s;e of them as Receivers, and to fol|low their bu&s;ines. And in the <HI>Manilia's,</HI> or <HI>Philippin</HI> I&s;lands, there are &s;ome of the&s;e Blacks &s;o rich, that many of them have offer'd twenty thou&s;and Croi|&s;ats to the Vice-Roy, for liberty to wear Ho&s;e and Shoo's, which they are not permitted to wear. Some of the&s;e Blacks have thirty Slaves attending upon them, very richly habited; but only they go barefoot. And had the <HI>Portugals</HI> permitted them to &s;et out Ships of their own, and to have cho&s;en Captains and other Officers at their own plea&s;ure, the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> would not have made &s;uch
<PB N="77" REF="195">
large, at lea&s;t not &s;o ea&s;ie Conque&s;ts in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The&s;e Blacks are very couragious and good Soldiers, and &s;everal of the Religious Orders have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that they will learn more in &s;ix months in one of their Colledges, than the <HI>Portugal</HI> Children in a year, whatever Science you put them to; which is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Portugals</HI> keep them &s;o low. The natural Inhabitants of the Country about <HI>Goa,</HI> are Idolaters, and wor&s;hip &s;everal &s;orts of Idols, which they &s;ay are the Re&s;emblance of &s;everal that have done good works, to whom they ought to give prai&s;e by adorning their Portraitures. There are many of the&s;e Idolaters who wor&s;hip Apes. And therefore in the I&s;land of <HI>Sal&s;ete,</HI> there was a Pagod, where the Idolaters kept in a Che&s;t, like a Tomb, the Bones and Nails of an Ape, which they &s;aid had been mighty &s;erviceable to their Anche&s;tors, by bringing news and intelligence to them, when any ho&s;tile Princes pro&s;ecuted them; for which purpo&s;e they would &s;ometimes &s;wim through the very Sea it &s;elf. The <HI>Indians</HI> come from &s;everal parts in proce&s;&s;ion, and make offerings to this Pagod. But the Clergy of <HI>Goa,</HI> e&s;pecially the Inqui&s;itors, caus'd the Tomb one day to be taken away, and brought it to <HI>Goa,</HI> where it remain'd a good while, by rea&s;on of the difference which it made between the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and the people. For the Idolaters offering a great &s;um of Money to have their Reliques again, the people were willing to have re&s;tor'd them; &s;aying, that the Money would do well upon any occa&s;ion of War, or el&s;e to relieve the poor. But the Clergy were of a contrary opinion, and maintain'd that &s;uch a piece of Idolatry was not to be endur'd upon any account what&s;oever. At length the Arch-Bi&s;hop and the Inqui&s;itors, by their own Authority, took away the Tomb, and &s;ending it in a Ve&s;&s;el twenty Leagues out to Sea, caus'd it to be thrown to the bottom of the Ocean. They thought to have burn'd it, but the Idola|ters would have rak'd up the A&s;hes again, which would have been but a new food to their Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Goa</HI> abundance of <HI>Clergy-men;</HI> for be&s;ides the Arch-Bi&s;hop and his Clergy, there are <HI>Dominicans, Au&s;tin-Friars, Franci&s;cans,</HI> Barefoot <HI>Carme|lites, Je&s;uits,</HI> and <HI>Capuchins,</HI> with two Religious Hou&s;es, whereof the <HI>Au&s;tin-Fryars</HI> are Directors or Governours. The religious <HI>Carmelites,</HI> that came la&s;t, are the be&s;t &s;eated; for thought they are &s;omewhat at a di&s;tance from the heart of the City, yet they have the advantage of a fine Air, and the mo&s;t healthy &s;ituation in all <HI>Goa.</HI> It &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground, free to the refre&s;hment of the Wind; and it is very well built, with two Galleries one over the other The <HI>Au&s;tin-Fryars,</HI> who were the fir&s;t that came to <HI>Goa,</HI> were indifferently well &s;eated, at the foot of a little ri&s;ing ground, their Church al&s;o &s;tanding upon a ri&s;ing ground with a fair <HI>Piazza</HI> before it; but when they had built their Ha|bitation, the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> de&s;ir'd them to &s;ell that ri&s;ing ground, which was then a void place, under pretence of making a Garden in it for the recreation of their Scholars, But after they had purchas'd it, they built a mo&s;t &s;tately Colledge upon the &s;ame ground, which quite &s;tops and choaks up the <HI>Au&s;tin-Friars</HI> Co|vent, &s;o that they have no Air at all. There happen'd &s;everal Conte&s;ts about this bu&s;ine&s;s, but at length the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> got the better. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> are known by the name of <HI>Paulists;</HI> by rea&s;on that their great Church is dedi|cated to St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Nor do they wear Hats or Corner-Caps, as in <HI>Europe,</HI> but only a certain Bonnet, re&s;embling the Skull of a Hat without the Brims; &s;ome|what like the Bonnets which the Grand <HI>Siegnors</HI> Slaves wear; of which I have given you a de&s;cription in my relation of <HI>Seraglio.</HI> They have five Hou&s;es in <HI>Goa,</HI> the Colledg of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the <HI>Seminary,</HI> the Profe&s;&s;ors Hou&s;e, the <HI>No|viciate,</HI> and the Good Je&s;us. The paintings in this Hou&s;e are admirable pieces of Workman&s;hip. In the year 1663 the Colledge was burnt by an accident which happen'd in the night, &s;o that it co&s;t them near &s;ixty thou&s;and Crowns to rebuild it.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pital of <HI>Goa</HI> was formerly the mo&s;t famous in all <HI>India.</HI> For in re|gard the Revenues thereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re very great, the &s;ick per&s;ons were very care|fully look'd after. But &s;ince the change of the Governours, there is but very bad accommodation; and &s;everal of the <HI>Europeans</HI> that have been put in, have never come forth again, but in their Coffins. However, they have lately found out a way to &s;ave &s;ome by frequent Blood-letting. They let Blood &s;ometimes
<PB N="78" REF="196">
as occa&s;ion requires, thirty or forty times, even as often as any ill-blood comes forth; as they did by me one time that I was at <HI>Surat.</HI> Butter and fle&s;h is very dangerous to them that are &s;ick, and many times co&s;t them their lives. Formerly they made &s;everal &s;orts of well-ta&s;ted diet for tho&s;e that recovered: Now they &s;erve the Patient only with young Beef-broth, and a di&s;h of Rice. U&s;ually the poorer &s;ort that recover their health, complain of drowth, and call for water. But they that look after them, being only Blacks, or Mongrels, a &s;ort of covetous and pittile&s;s people, will not give them a drop, unle&s;s they put mony in their hands; and to colour their wickedne&s;s, they give it them by &s;tealth, pretending what they do to be again&s;t the Phy&s;itian's order. As for Sweet-meats and Pre|&s;erves, there is no want of them; but they are not a diet which contributes over|much to the re&s;toring of decay'd &s;trength, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e hot Countreys where the body requires rather cooling and refre&s;hing nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>I have forgot one thing in reference to their more frequent blood-lettings than among us <HI>Europeans.</HI> Which is, that to bring their colour again, and to re&s;tore them to perfect health, they order the Patient to drink for twelve days together three gla&s;&s;es of Cow's Urine; one in the morning, another at noon, and another at night. But in regard it is a very nau&s;eous &s;ort of drink, the Patient &s;wallows as little as he can, how de&s;irous &s;oe ver he may be of his health. They learnt this remedy from the Idolaters of the Country; and whether the Patient will take it or no, they never let him &s;tir out of the Ho&s;pital, till the twelve days are ex|pir'd wherein he ought to drink it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What the Author did, during his &s;tay at <HI>Goa,</HI> the la&s;t time he went thither in the year <HI>1648.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWO days before I departed from <HI>Mingrela</HI> for <HI>Goa,</HI> I wrote to <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> St. <HI>Amant,</HI> who was Engineer, to &s;end me a Man of War, for fear of the <HI>Malvares</HI> which are upon the Coa&s;t, which he immediately did. I parted from <HI>Mingrela</HI> the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January</HI> 1648, and arriv'd at <HI>Goa</HI> the 25<HI>th.</HI> And in regard it was late, I &s;taid till the next morning before I went to vi&s;it the <HI>Vice-Roy, Don Philip de Ma&s;caregnas,</HI> who had formerly been Governor of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> He made me very welcome, and during the two months that I tarri'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> he &s;ent to me a Gentleman five or &s;ix times, who brought me &s;till to the Powder-Hou&s;e, which was without the City, where he often us'd to be. For he took great delight in levelling Guns, wherein he ask'd my advice, e&s;teeming very much a Pi&s;tol very curiou&s;ly and richly inlaid, which I pre&s;ented him at my arrival. This Pi&s;tol the <HI>French</HI>-Con&s;ul at <HI>Aleppo</HI> gave me, the fellow of it being unhappily lo&s;t: for el&s;e the Pair had been pre&s;ented by the <HI>French</HI>-Nation to the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who might then have boa&s;ted him&s;elf the Ma&s;ter of the faire&s;t and be&s;t-made pair of Pi&s;tols in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> admits no per&s;on whatever, no not his Children to &s;it at his Table. But there is a little partition in the Dining-room, where there is a Cloath laid for the Principal Officers, as is u&s;ual in the Courts of the <HI>German</HI>-Princes. The next day I went to wait upon the Arch-Bi&s;hop, and the next day after I de|&s;ign'd to have vi&s;ited the Inqui&s;itor; but I under&s;tood by one of his Gentlemen that he was bu&s;y, writing into <HI>Portugal;</HI> there being two Ships ready to weigh Anchor, that only &s;taid for his di&s;patches. After the Ships were &s;et &s;ail, he &s;ent the &s;ame Gentleman to tell me that he expected me at the Inqui&s;ition-Hou&s;e, about two or three in the afternoon. I fail'd not to go thither at the time pre|fix'd&punc; when I came, a Page brought me into a large Hall, where after I had walk'd a quarter of an hour, an Officer came and carri'd me into the Chamber where the Inqui&s;itor was. After I had pa&s;t through two Galleries, and &s;ome Chambers, I en|ter'd into a little Chamber where the Inqui&s;itor &s;at at the end of a great Table like a Billiard-Table, which, as well as the Chairs and Stools in the Chamber, was
<PB N="79" REF="196">
cover'd with green Cloath, &s;uch as is carri'd out of <HI>England.</HI> He told me I was welcome, and after a Complement or two, he ask'd me what Religion I was of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> I an&s;wer'd him, of the Prote&s;tant Religion. He ask'd me then, if my Father and Mother were of the &s;ame Religion; and after I had &s;atisfi'd him that they were &s;o; He told me again I was welcome, calling out at the &s;ame time for &s;ome other per|&s;ons to enter. Thereupon, the Hangings being held up, there came in ten or twelve per&s;ons out of another room hard-by. The fir&s;t of the Train were two <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars, follow'd by two Dominicans, two barefoot-Carmelites, and &s;ome other of the Clergy; whom the Inqui&s;itor told who I was, and a&s;&s;ur'd them I had brought no prohibited Books; for indeed, knowing their orders, I had left my Bible at <HI>Mingrela.</HI> We di&s;cours'd about two hours of &s;everal things, but particularly of my Travels; the whole Company te&s;tifying their de&s;ire to hear me make &s;ome repetitions. Three days after the Inqui&s;itor &s;ent for me to dine with him at a fair Hou&s;e, about half a league from the City, which belongs to the Bare-foot Carmelites. It is one of the lovelie&s;t Structures in all the <HI>Indies;</HI> and I will tell you in &s;hort how the Carmelites came by it. There was a Gentleman in <HI>Goa,</HI> who&s;e Father and Grandfather had got great E&s;tates by Merchandizing; and he it was that had built this Hou&s;e, which might well have pa&s;t for a mo&s;t noble Palace. He had no mind to Marry, but being altogether addicted to his devotions, he very much frequented the <HI>Austin</HI>-Friars, to whom he &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o affectionate, that he made his Will, wherein he gave them all his E&s;tate, provided they would bury him on the right-&s;ide of the High-Altar where he intended a &s;umptuous Monument. Now according to the common report, this Gentleman was a Leaper, which &s;ome jealous per&s;ons endeavour'd to make the World believe, &s;eeing he had given away all his E&s;tate to the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars. Thereupon they told him that the ground on the right-hand of the High-Alter was a place only fit for a <HI>Vice-Roy;</HI> and that a leaprous per&s;on was not to be laid there: which was the opinion of the generality of the people, and of a good part of the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars them|&s;elves. Thereupon &s;ome of the Fathers of the Covent coming to &s;peak with the Gentleman, on purpo&s;e to per&s;wade him to choo&s;e &s;ome other place in the Church, he was &s;o offended at the propo&s;al, that he never went more to the <HI>Austin</HI>-Friars, but always went to perform his devotions among the Carmelites, who receiv'd him with open arms, and accepted the conditions which the other had refus'd. Nor did he live long after he had intere&s;ted him&s;elf with that Order; &s;o that the Carmelites having magnificently buri'd him, enjoy'd all his E&s;tate, with this &s;ame Hou&s;e, where we were &s;plendidly entertain'd with Mu&s;ick all the time of Din|ner.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at <HI>Goa</HI> from the twenty-fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> till the eleventh of <HI>March,</HI> de|parting thence that very day in the evening, after I had taken leave of the <HI>Vice-Roy.</HI> I begg'd leave al&s;o of the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> for a <HI>French</HI>-Gentlemen, who&s;e name was <HI>Belloy,</HI> to go along with me: which was granted me; but through the impru|dence of that Gentleman, who did not tell me the rea&s;on of his coming to <HI>Goa,</HI> he had like to have been taken from me again, and it was an even-lay, that we had not been both carri'd to the Inqui&s;ition. This Gentleman had left the place of his Nativity to travel over <HI>Holland,</HI> where having run him&s;elf in debt, and finding no per&s;on that would lend him any Money, he re&s;olv'd to go for <HI>India.</HI> Thereupon he li&s;ted him&s;elf as a private Souldier upon the accompt of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Com|pany; and came to <HI>Batavia</HI> at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made War again&s;t the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in <HI>Ceylan.</HI> Being arriv'd, they &s;ent him away among the recruits which were &s;ent into that I&s;land; and the <HI>Holland</HI>-General &s;eeing &s;uch a re|inforcement of &s;tout men commanded by a <HI>French</HI>-Captain, who&s;e name was St. <HI>Amant,</HI> a per&s;on of great courage and experience; he re&s;olv'd to be&s;iege <HI>Ne|gombe,</HI> a con&s;iderable Fort in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> They made two a&s;&s;aults wherein the <HI>French</HI>-men behav'd them&s;elves valiantly, e&s;pecially St. <HI>Amant,</HI> and <HI>John de Ro&s;e,</HI> who were both wounded. The General of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;eeing them to be two &s;uch men of courage, made a promi&s;e that if <HI>Negombe</HI> were taken, one of them two &s;hould be Governor. The place was taken, and the General kept his word with St. <HI>Amant:</HI> but the News being carri'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> a young Gentleman of kin to the General, and but newly arriv'd out of <HI>Holland,</HI> obtain'd to be Governour of <HI>Negombe,</HI> to the prejudice of St. <HI>Amant,</HI> and came with an
<PB N="80" REF="197">
order from the Council at <HI>Batavia</HI> to di&s;place him. St. <HI>Amant</HI> incens'd at &s;uch ill-u&s;age, inveigles to his Party a matter of fifteen or twenty, mo&s;t part <HI>French</HI>-Souldiers, among whom were <HI>Mon&s;ieur Belloy, Mare&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>John de Ro&s;e,</HI> and re|volts to the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> The <HI>Portugals</HI> encourag'd by the reinforcement of &s;uch a &s;tout, though &s;mall number of men, &s;torm'd <HI>Negombe</HI> again, and took it at the &s;econd a&s;&s;ault. At that time was <HI>Don Philip de Ma&s;caregnas</HI> Governor of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> and all the places belonging to it, under the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Portugal.</HI> He liv'd al&s;o at the City of <HI>Colombo;</HI> and then it was, that having receiv'd Letters from <HI>Goa</HI> that the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> was dead, and that the Council and all the Nobility de&s;ir'd him to come and &s;ucceed in his place, he re&s;olv'd to &s;ee St. <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> and his Companions before his departure, to the end he might be&s;tow upon them &s;ome proper reward. So &s;oon as he &s;aw them, he was re&s;olv'd to take them along with him to <HI>Goa.</HI> Whether it were that he thought he might have better opportu|nities to advance them there; or that he thought it convenient to have &s;tout men about him, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Malavares</HI> who lay in wait for him with forty Ve&s;|&s;els, whereas he had but twenty&punc;two. But they were no &s;ooner come to make <HI>Cape-Comorin,</HI> when the winds ro&s;e, and &s;uch a Tempe&s;t follow'd, that the Ve&s;&s;els were di&s;pers'd, and many of them unfortunately ca&s;t away. They that were in <HI>Don Philip's</HI> Ve&s;&s;el did all they could to get to the &s;hoar, but &s;eeing they could not, and that the Ship was ready to &s;plit, St. <HI>Amant</HI> and his Six other Compani|ons threw them&s;elves into the Sea with cords and pieces of planks, and &s;o be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, that they made a &s;hift not only to &s;ave them&s;elves, but <HI>Don Philip</HI> al&s;o. Hereupon <HI>Don Philip</HI> coming to <HI>Goa,</HI> after he had made his entrance gave to St. <HI>Amant</HI> the Command of Grand Ma&s;ter of the Artillery, and Superintendent General over all the Forts which the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had in <HI>India.</HI> He marri'd him al&s;o to a young Virgin, with whom he had twenty-thou&s;and Crowns, who&s;e Fa|ther was an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> who had quitted the Company, and marri'd a Natural Daughter of one of the <HI>Vice-Roy's</HI> of <HI>Goa.</HI> As for <HI>John de Ro&s;e,</HI> he de&s;ir'd leave of the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> to return to <HI>Colombo,</HI> where, by his favour, he marri'd a young Widow, half Native, half <HI>Portugueze,</HI> by whom he had a fair fortune. <HI>Mare&s;ts</HI> the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> made Captain of his Guards, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Command in all his Court, being oblig'd to <HI>Mare&s;ts</HI> for his life, who was the per&s;on that bore him upon his &s;houlders to &s;ave him from drowning. <HI>Du Belloy</HI> de&s;ir'd leave that he might go to <HI>Macao,</HI> which was granted him. For he under&s;tood that the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Portugal</HI>-Gentry, retir'd to that place, after they had got E&s;tates by Merchandizing; that they were very courteous to &s;trangers, and withal extremely addicted to play, which was <HI>Du Belloy</HI>'s chief delight. He liv'd two years at <HI>Macao,</HI> very much to his content; for when he wanted Money, the Gentry lent it him freely. One day he had won above &s;ix-thou&s;and Crowns, but going to play again, he was &s;o unfortunate as to lo&s;e it all, be&s;ides a good &s;um of Money which his friends had lent him. Being thus at a lo&s;s, and finding that no-body would lend him any more Money, he began to &s;wear again&s;t a Picture that hung in the room, which was the Portraiture of &s;ome Papi&s;tical Saint; &s;aying in his pa&s;&s;ion that it was an u&s;ual thing with them that plaid, that if they &s;aw a Saint Picture hang in their &s;ight, it made them lo&s;e; and that if that Picture had not been there he had certainly won. Immediately the Inqui&s;itor was inform'd of this, (for in every City in <HI>India</HI> under the Juri&s;diction of the
<HI>Portuguezes</HI> there is one. However his power is limited; having no other authority than to &s;eize the per&s;on of him that &s;ays or acts any thing again&s;t their Religion, to hear the Witne&s;&s;es, and to &s;end the Offender with the examinations to <HI>Goa</HI> in the fir&s;t &s;hip which is bound thither: where the inqui&s;itor-General has an ab&s;olute Power either to ab&s;olve him, or to put him to death.) Thereupon <HI>Du Belloy</HI> was put a|board a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of ten or twelve Guns loaded with Irons: with a &s;trict charge to the Captain to keep him &s;afe, and &s;ome threats that he &s;hould be an&s;werable for him if he e&s;cap'd. But &s;o &s;oon as the Ship was out at Sea, the Captain, who was of a noble di&s;po&s;ition, and knew <HI>Du Belloy</HI> to be of a good Family, took off his Irons, and made him &s;it at his own Table; giving him al&s;o Linnen, and other convenient Apparel nece&s;&s;ary for the Voyage, which was to continue forty days. They put into <HI>Goa</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>February</HI> 1649; and the Ship was no &s;ooner come into Harbour, but St. <HI>Amant</HI> came a-board by the Governor's order, as well
<PB N="81" REF="197">
to receive his Letters, as to hear what news in <HI>China.</HI> But his &s;urprize was very great, to &s;ee <HI>Belloy</HI> in that condition, and that the Captain would not let him go, before he had &s;urrender'd him up into the hands of the Inqui&s;itor. Ne|verthele&s;s, in regard that St. <HI>Amant</HI> was a per&s;on of great credit, he obtain'd of the Captain, that <HI>Belloy</HI> &s;hould go along with him into the City. As for <HI>Belloy</HI> he immediately and for the nonce &s;hifted him&s;elf into his old Cloaths, which were all to tatters and full of Vermin; and St. <HI>Amant,</HI> who knew there was no dallying with the Inqui&s;ition, took that &s;ea&s;on to pre&s;ent him to the Inqui|&s;itor; who &s;eeing a Gentleman in &s;uch a &s;ad condition, had &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion upon him, and allow'd him the whole City for his Pri&s;on; on condition he &s;hould &s;urrender his body, upon demand when he under&s;tood what was inform'd again&s;t him. In the interim St. <HI>Amant</HI> brings <HI>Du Belloy</HI> to my Lodging ju&s;t as I was going to vi&s;it the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mira,</HI> whom I formerly knew at <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI> when he was Prior of the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> at <HI>Galata.</HI> I de&s;ir'd them to &s;tay a while and to dine with me, which they did; after which I proffer'd my Hou&s;e and Table to <HI>Du Belloy,</HI> who liv'd with me; and for whom I al&s;o bought two new Suits of Apparel, and Linnen convenient. However, all the while that I &s;tay'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> which was ten or twelve days, I could not per&s;wade the Sieur <HI>Du Belloy</HI> to put on tho&s;e new Cloaths, not knowing the rea&s;on, though he promis'd me every day. But being upon my departure, I told him I was go|ing to take leave of the Vice-Roy; whereupon he de&s;ir'd me to procure leave for him al&s;o; which I did. We departed toward evening in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el wherein I came, and about midnight the Sieur <HI>Belloy</HI> began to &s;hift him&s;elf, and when he had done he threw his old raggs into the Sea, &s;wearing again&s;t the In|qui&s;ition like a mad man; I under&s;tanding nothing all this while of the bu&s;ine&s;s. When I heard him &s;wear in that manner, I told him we were not yet out of the <HI>Portugals</HI> hands; neither were he and I with five or &s;ix Servants, able to defend our &s;elves again&s;t forty Sea-men that belong'd to the Ship. I ask'd him then, why he &s;wore &s;o heartily again&s;t the Inqui&s;ition; he reply'd, that he would tell me all the circum&s;tances of the Story; which he did, when we came to <HI>Min|grela,</HI> which was about eight a Clock in the morning. When we landed we met certain <HI>Hollanders</HI> with the Commander, who were eating Oy&s;ters and drinking Sack upon the Shoar. Immediately they ask'd me who that per&s;on was with me. I told them it was a Gentleman who attending the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor into <HI>Portugal,</HI> had taken Shipping there for <HI>India,</HI> together with four or five more whom he had left at <HI>Goa;</HI> but that neither the &s;cituation of the place, nor the humour of the <HI>Portugals</HI> plea&s;ing him, he had de&s;ir'd my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his return for <HI>Europe.</HI> Three or four days after, I bought him an Oxe to carry him to <HI>Surat;</HI> and I gave him a Servant to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, together with a Letter to Father <HI>Zenon,</HI> a <HI>Capuchin,</HI> wherein I de&s;ir'd him to &s;peak to my Broker to pay him ten Crowns a month for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and to de&s;ire of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident to embark him for <HI>Europe</HI> with the fir&s;t opportunity. But it fell out contrary to my Intentions; for Father <HI>Zenon</HI> carri'd him back again along with him to <HI>Goa,</HI> where he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to do for Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> his Com|panion; of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in the next Chapter. Father <HI>Zenon</HI> without doubt believ'd that <HI>Du Belloy</HI> making his appearance to the Inqui&s;ition, and de&s;iring his pardon might have ea&s;ily obtain'd it. 'Tis very true he did obtain it, but it was after he had been two years in the Inqui&s;ition, from which he was not di&s;charg'd but with a &s;ulphur'd Shift, with a St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Cro&s;s upon his Stomack. There was with him another Gentleman, call'd <HI>Lewis de Bar upon the Seine,</HI> who was us'd in the &s;ame manner; and they always put them to ac|company tho&s;e who were put to death. The Sieur <HI>Du Belloy</HI> did very ill to return to <HI>Goa,</HI> and wor&s;e to appear afterwards again at <HI>Mingrela,</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who under&s;tanding he had formerly revolted out of their &s;er|vice, by the intelligence they receiv'd from their Commander at <HI>Surat,</HI> &s;eiz'd his per&s;on, and &s;ent him away in
a Ship that was going for <HI>Batavia.</HI> They pre|tended that they &s;ent him to the General of the Company, to do with him as he &s;hould think fitting. But I am in part a&s;&s;ur'd, that as &s;oon as the Ve&s;&s;el was out at Sea, they put the poor Gentleman into a Sack, and threw him into the Sea. This was the end of the Sieur <HI>Du Belloy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="198" MS="y">
As for <HI>Sieur des Mare&s;ts,</HI> he was a Gentleman, born in the <HI>Dauphinate,</HI> near to <HI>Loriol,</HI> who having kill'd his adver&s;ary in a Duel, fled into <HI>Poland,</HI> where he &s;o far &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf, that he won the e&s;teem and affection of the General of the <HI>Polonian</HI> Army. At that time the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI> kept in the pri&s;on of the Seven Towers at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> two Noble <HI>Polonians;</HI> whereupon the <HI>Po|lonian</HI> General ob&s;erving the courage and addre&s;s of this <HI>Des Mare&s;ts,</HI> who was a daring Fellow, and a good Engineer be&s;ides, made a propo&s;al to him, to go to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to endeavour, if he could by any means in the world, to &s;et tho&s;e princes at liberty. <HI>Des Mare&s;ts</HI> willingly accepted the employment, and without doubt he had &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign, had he not been di&s;covered by &s;ome <HI>Turks,</HI> who accus'd him for having been too circum&s;pect in viewing the &s;even Towers, &s;eeing him with a Chalk Pencil in his hand, ready to take the draught thereof, which &s;eem'd to tend to no good de&s;ign. This had been enough to have ruin'd the Gentleman, had not Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Ce&s;y,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour &s;tifl'd the further examination of the bu&s;ine&s;s by &s;ome Pre&s;ent; which in <HI>Turky</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;overeign remedy upon all accidents of danger; telling the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> that he was only a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman that travel'd for his plea&s;ure, and one that was going for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with the fir&s;t opportunity. However it was not <HI>Mare&s;ts</HI> de&s;ign at that time to go very far, for he intended to have return'd into <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as he had us'd his utmo&s;t indeavours to &s;et the Princes at liberty; but for his own &s;afety it behov'd him to give it out that he was gone to <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and at length he was con&s;train'd to go thither indeed. As for the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> he had re&s;olv'd never to &s;et the two Noblemen at liberty. But at length they were &s;o fortunate as to gain the love of a young <HI>Turk,</HI> who was the Son of the Captain of the Seven Towers; with whom the Father u&s;ually tru&s;ted the Keys to open and &s;hut the Gates of the Pri&s;on. The night appointed for their flight, he made as if he had &s;hut &s;ome doors, the Padlocks whereof he left all open. But he dur&s;t not do &s;o by the two fir&s;t Gates, near one of which the Captain with a &s;trong Guard lay, for fear of being di&s;cover'd. The young man, who had entirely devoted him&s;elf to &s;erve the Princes, having fore&s;een this diffi|culty before, had bethought him&s;elf of Rope-Ladders to get over the two Walls; to which purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a corre&s;pondence within and without. Finding therefore that becau&s;e the utmo&s;t of &s;everity was not us'd toward tho&s;e Princes, they had the liberty to receive &s;everal Di&s;hes of Meat from the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours Kitchin, the Clerk of the Kitchin was made of the plot, who thereupon &s;ent them in &s;everal Cords in Pa&s;ties, whereof they made Ladders. The bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the e&s;cape was made, and the young <HI>Turk</HI> fled with the <HI>Polonian</HI> Lords into <HI>Poland,</HI> where he turn'd Chri&s;tian, and receiv'd ample rewards both in Employments and Money. The &s;ame gra|titude proportionably was ob&s;erved toward tho&s;e who had contributed toward the liberty of the Princes, who amply acknowledg'd the &s;ervices which they had receiv'd from every one of them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Sieur <HI>Des Mare&s;ts</HI> arrives at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Capuchin</HI> Fryars, they brought him to my Lodging, where he had the freedom of my Table, and a Chamber. He &s;taid &s;ome time at <HI>I&s;pa|han,</HI> during which he got acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who had a great e&s;teem for him, finding him to be a per&s;on of merit. But it happen'd one day, that his curio&s;ity putting him upon a bold attempt, had like to have been the ruine of him and all the <HI>Franks</HI> in <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Never the Inn where we lodg'd there was a large Bath, where the men and women by turns take their times to come and bath them&s;elves; and where the Queen of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> during her &s;tay at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> as &s;he return'd home to <HI>Mecca,</HI> delighted to go and prattle with the <HI>French</HI> mens wives. The Sieur <HI>Des Mare&s;ts</HI> having a pa&s;&s;ionate de|&s;ire to &s;ee what the women did, &s;atisfi'd his curio&s;ity, by means of a cranny in the Arch of the Vault, which he had ob&s;erved when he went thither; for having found out a way without &s;ide to get up to that Arch, through a blind hole that was next to the Inn where he lay, the Arch being flat, as I have de&s;crib'd them in my relations of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> he laid him&s;elf upon his belly, and &s;aw throtgh the cranny what he fo much long'd to behold. He was at this &s;port &s;ome ten or twelve times; and not being able to contain him&s;elf, he told me
<PB N="83" REF="198">
one day what he had done. I bid him have a care of going there any more, for fear of ruining him&s;elf and all the <HI>French</HI> men in that City. But he contrary to my advice went thither two or three times after that, till at length he was di&s;|cover'd by one of the women of the Bath that took care of the Linnen, and dry them without, upon Perches as high as the top of the Arch, to which they get up by a little Ladder. The woman &s;eeing a man lying all along upon his belly, &s;eiz'd upon his Hat, and began to cry out. But <HI>Mare&s;ts,</HI> to get him|&s;elf out of the mire, and to hinder the woman from making more noi&s;e, put two <HI>Tomans,</HI> into her hand. When he return'd to the Inn, I perceiv'd him to look as if he had been &s;car'd, and conjecturing that &s;ome ill accident had befall'n him, I pre&s;s'd him to confe&s;s what was the matter. He was loath at fir&s;t, but at length he confe&s;s'd how he had been di&s;cover'd by a woman, and how he had &s;top'd her mouth with money. Thereupon I told him, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for him to fly, for that the danger was far greater than he imagin'd. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident al&s;o, to whom I thought it convenient to tell what had pa&s;s'd, was of the &s;ame opinion; upon which we gave him a Mule, and as much money as was nece&s;&s;ary for him, ordering him to go to <HI>Bander,</HI> and thence by Sea to <HI>Surat.</HI> I gave him a Letter of Recommendation to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, who was my Friend; whom I al&s;o de&s;ir'd to let him have two hundred Crowns, if he had oc|ca&s;ion for them. I wrote very much in his commendation; and mention'd the proffer which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> had made him, to &s;end him with Letters to the General, who would not fail to employ him according to his merit. For indeed at that time that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had War with the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in <HI>Ceylan,</HI> any per&s;on of wit, and courage, like the Sieur <HI>Des Mare&s;ts,</HI> was very acceptable to them. Which made them very earne&s;t with him, to take an em|ployment among them; and to that end, they care&s;s'd him, and pre&s;ented him very nobly during his &s;tay at <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> But he told them, that not being of their Religion, he was unwilling to &s;erve them again&s;t the <HI>Portugue&s;es;</HI> which was the only rea&s;on that hinder'd him from accepting the offers which I had made him. The&s;e particulars I wrote in his behalf to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident at <HI>Surat;</HI> &s;o that the Sieur <HI>Des Mare&s;ts</HI> being de&s;irous to go to <HI>Goa</HI> to &s;erve the <HI>Portu|gals,</HI> the Pre&s;ident wrote in his behalf to the Vice-Roy, by whom he was very much belov'd, relating to him, be&s;ides, what the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had proffer'd him, that his recommendation might be the more acceptable. Thereupon the Vice-Roy made him very welcome; and upon the Sieur <HI>Mare&s;ts</HI> de&s;ire to be em|ploy'd in <HI>Ceylan</HI> in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Army, he &s;ent him away with the fir&s;t oppor|tunity, with Letters of Recommendation to Don <HI>Philip de Ma&s;caregnas,</HI> who was then Governour of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> and all tho&s;e places that belong'd to it under the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> It happen'd three days after, that they lo&s;t <HI>Nagombe,</HI> and when they retook it, the Sieur <HI>Mare&s;ts</HI> was one of tho&s;e that receiv'd mo&s;t wounds, and won mo&s;t honour in the A&s;&s;aults. He it was that afterwards was mo&s;t in&s;trumental in &s;aving Don <HI>Philip</HI> from being drown'd; &s;o that when Don <HI>Philip</HI> came to be Vice-Roy of <HI>Goa,</HI> he could not think he de|&s;erv'd a le&s;s reward than the Command of his Guards; in which employment he dy'd within three or four Months. He was very much lamented by the Vice-Roy, by whom he was entirely belov'd. But he left his E&s;tate to a Prie&s;t, with whom he had contracted a particular friend&s;hip; upon condition that he &s;hould only pay me two hundred and fifty Crowns that I had lent him; which how|ever I had much ado to get out of the Prie&s;t's Clutches.</P>
<P>While I &s;tay'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> I was told a pretty &s;tory concerning a Caravel, or <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which arriv'd there but a little before, and came from <HI>Lisbon.</HI> When &s;he was about to make the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> there happen'd &s;uch a violent Tempe&s;t, as la&s;ted five or &s;ix hours, and put the Marriners to &s;uch a <HI>nonplus,</HI> that they knew not were they were. At length they fell into a Bay, where they &s;aw &s;everal Inhabitants; and as &s;oon as they came to an Anchor, they beheld the &s;hore cov er'd with men, women, and children, that te&s;tify'd a &s;trange amazement to &s;ee white people, and &s;uch kind of people as the Caravel. The mi&s;chief was, that they could not under&s;tand one another, but by &s;igns. But after the <HI>Portugals</HI> had giv'n tho&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> Tobacco, Bisket, and Water, the next day the people brought them a great quantity of young O&s;triches, and other

Fowl that &s;eem'd to re&s;emble large Gee&s;e, but &s;o fat, that they had very little lean. The Feathers of tho&s;e Birds were very lovely, and tho&s;e upon the Belley proper for Beds One of the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> Mariners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">old me a large Gu&s;hion &s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> with tho&s;e Feathers, and related to me what had happen'd to them in that Bay, where they &s;tay'd &s;even and twenty days. They gave tho&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> one thing or other every &s;cot, as Knives, Axes, fal&s;e Coral, and fal&s;e Pearls, out of hopes to have di&s;cover'd &s;ome&punc; Trade, and particularly whether they had any Gold; for they ob&s;erv'd that &s;ome of them wore pieces of Gold in their Ears; &s;ome beaten thin upon one &s;ide, and others like the Nails of a Lock. They brought two of the people to <HI>Goa;</HI> and I &s;aw one of them that wore &s;everal of tho&s;e pieces of Gold in &s;everal parts of each Ear. The Mariner told me, that there were &s;ome of their women that wore of tho&s;e pieces of Gold under their Chins, and in their No&s;trils. Eight or nine days after the <HI>Portugals</HI> arriv'd in that Bay, tho&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> brought them little pieces of Am|bergree&s;e, &s;ome Gold, but very little; &s;ome Elephants teeth, but very &s;mall&punc; &s;ome O&s;triches, and other Birds, &s;ome Veni&s;on; but for Fi&s;h there was abun|dance. The <HI>Portugals</HI> endeavour'd all they could by &s;igns to know where they found the Ambergree&s;e, for it was very good. The Vice-Roy &s;hew'd me a a piece that weigh'd not above half an Ounce, but he a&s;&s;ur'd me withall that he had never &s;een &s;o good. They al&s;o labour'd to di&s;cover where they had the Gold. After the Elephants teeth they made no great enquiry &s;eeing a great number of Elephants that came to drink at a River that threw it &s;elf into the Bay. At length after they had &s;tay'd three weeks, the <HI>Portugals</HI> finding it impo&s;&s;ible for them to di&s;cover any thing more, becau&s;e they under&s;tood not one ano|ther, re&s;olv'd to &s;et &s;ail with the fir&s;t wind. And becau&s;e they had always &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> aboard in regard they were very liberal of their Tobacco, Bisket, and &s;trong Water, they thought good to bring two of them along in the Ve&s;&s;el; in hopes that they might learn the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, or that there might &s;ome Child be found out that might under&s;tand what they &s;aid&punc; The Mariners told me, that when they &s;et &s;ail, after the <HI>Cafres</HI> &s;aw that they they had carri'd two of their people away, who perhaps were no incon&s;iderable per&s;ons, they tore their Hair, &s;truck their Brea&s;ts&punc; as if they had been frantick, and &s;et up a mo&s;t horrible yelling and howling. When they were brought to <HI>Goa,</HI> they could never be brougut to learn any thing of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language. So that they could get out of them nothing of that further di&s;covery at which they aim'd, of a Country from whence they only brought away two pound of Gold; three pound of Ambergree&s;e, and thirty-five or forty Elephants teeth. One of the <HI>Cafres</HI> liv'd but &s;ix months, the other fifteen; but both langui&s;h'd and pin'd to death for grief to be &s;o trapann'd.</P>
<P>From <HI>Goa</HI> I pa&s;s'd to <HI>Mingrela,</HI> where there fell out an accident not to be forgotten. An Idolater dying, and the Fire being ready prepar'd for the burn|ing of the Body, his Wife who had no Children, by the permi&s;&s;ion of the Governour, came to the Fire, and &s;tood among the Prie&s;ts and her Kindred, to be burnt with the Body of her deceas'd Husband. As they were taking three turns, according to cu&s;tom, about the place where the Fire was kindl'd, there fell of a &s;udden &s;o violent a Shower, that the Prie&s;ts willing to get out of the rain, thru&s;t the Woman all along into the Fire. But the Shower was &s;o vehement, and endur'd &s;o long a while, that the Fire was quench'd, and the Woman was not burn'd. About midnight &s;he aro&s;e, and went and knock'd at the door of one of her Kin&s;mens Hou&s;es, where Father <HI>Zenon</HI> and many <HI>Hol|landers</HI> &s;aw her, looking &s;o ga&s;tly and grimly, that it was enough to have &s;car'd them; however the pain that &s;he endur'd did not &s;o far terrifie her, but that three days after accompany'd by her Kindred, &s;he went and was burn'd according to her fir&s;t intention.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Story of Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and how he was put into the Inqui&s;ition at <HI>Goa</HI> by a &s;urpri&s;al.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Chek,</HI> who had marri'd the Elde&s;t of the Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Golconda,</HI> not be|ing able to per&s;wade Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> to &s;tay at <HI>Bagnabar,</HI> where he promis'd to build him an Hou&s;e and a Church; gave him an Ox and two men to carry him to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> where he &s;taid to embark for <HI>Pegn,</HI> according to the order of his Superiors. But finding no Ve&s;&s;el ready to fet &s;ail, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> drew him to <HI>Madre&s;|patan,</HI> where they have a Fort call'd St. <HI>George,</HI> and a general Factory for every thing that concerns the Countreys of <HI>Golconda, Pegu</HI> and <HI>Bengala.</HI> They over-per&s;wa|ded him that he might reap a fairer Harve&s;t in this place, than in any other part of the <HI>Indies;</HI> to which end they pre&s;ently built him a very neat Hou&s;e, and a Church. But in the conclu&s;ion, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ought not &s;o much the intere&s;t of Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> as their own. For <HI>Madre&s;patan</HI> is but half a league from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> a Sea-Town upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> indifferently well-built, as for|merly belonging to the <HI>Portugals.</HI> In that place there was a very great Trade, e&s;pecially for Calicuts, and a very great number of Merchants and Workmen liv'd there, the greate&s;t part whereof de&s;ir'd to inhabit at <HI>Madre&s;patan</HI> with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> but that there was no place for them to exerci&s;e their Religion in that place.

But now the Clergy of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>-Church &s;eeing Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> in &s;o high a re|putation, and that he drew the greate&s;t part of their Congregation to <HI>Madre&s;pa|tan,</HI> were &s;o enrag'd again&s;t him that they re&s;olv'd to ruine him. And thus they laid their plot. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portuguezes</HI> being neer-neighbours, could not choo&s;e but have &s;everal quarrels one among another, and &s;till Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> was appli'd to for the compo&s;ing their differences. Now one day it happen'd, that the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> quarrell'd on purpo&s;e with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mariners that were in St. <HI>Thomas</HI>-Road, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came by the wor&s;t. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident re|&s;olving to have &s;atisfaction for the injury, a War broke out between the two Na|tions: which had ruin'd all the Trade of that Country, had not the Merchants on both &s;ides been very diligent to bring things to an accommodation: not know|ing any thing of the wicked contrivance of particular per&s;ons again&s;t Father <HI>Ephraim.</HI> But all the interpo&s;ition of the Merchants avail'd nothing: the Friar mu&s;t be concern'd in the affair, he mu&s;t be the Mediator to act between party and party, which he readily accepted. But he was no &s;ooner enter'd into St. <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> but he was &s;eiz'd by ten or twelve Officers of the Inqui&s;ition, who &s;hipp'd him away in a Frigat that was bound at the &s;ame time for <HI>Goa.</HI> They fetter'd and manacl'd him, and kept him two and twenty days at Sea, before they would let him once put his foot a-&s;hore: though the be&s;t part of the Mariners lay a-&s;hoar every night. When they came to <HI>Goa,</HI> they &s;taid till night before they would land Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> to carry him to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>-Hou&s;e. For they were afraid, le&s;t if they &s;hould land him in the day, the people &s;hould know of it, and ri&s;e in the re&s;cue of a per&s;on, who was in an high veneration over all <HI>India.</HI> The news was pre&s;ently &s;pread abroad in all parts, that Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> was in the <HI>Inqui&s;i|tion,</HI> which very much amaz'd all the <HI>French</HI>-men. But he that was mo&s;t &s;ur|priz'd, and mo&s;t troubl'd at it was Friar <HI>Zenon,</HI> the Capuchin, who had been for|merlyly Father <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s Companion; who after he had con&s;ulted his friends, re|&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Goa,</HI> though he were put into the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> him&s;elf. For when a man is once &s;hut up there, if any one have the boldne&s;s to &s;peak to the Inqui&s;i|tor, or to any of his Councel in his behalf, he is pre&s;ently put into the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>

al&s;o, and accounted a greater Offender than the other.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e con&s;iderations, Father <HI>Zenon,</HI> taking along with him the <HI>Sieur de la Boulay,</HI> a decaid Gentleman, goes to <HI>Goa;</HI> where, when he arriv'd, he was vi&s;ited by &s;ome friends, who advi&s;e him to have a care not to open his mouth in the behalf of Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> unle&s;s he intended to bear him company in the <HI>Inqui&s;ition.</HI> Father <HI>Zenon</HI> &s;eeing he could do nothing at <HI>Goa,</HI> advis'd the <HI>Sieur de Boulay</HI> to return to <HI>Surat:</HI> and goes him&s;elf directly to <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> more particularly to inform him&s;elf concerning the rea&s;on of Father <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s being &s;ent away. But when he under&s;tood how he had been betraid at St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to have &s;atisfaction, and without acquainting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Pre&s;ident, com|municates his de&s;ign to the Captain that commanded in the Fort&punc; Who being in|cens'd, as were all the Souldiers, at the injury done Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> not only approv'd, but al&s;o promis'd Father <HI>Zenon</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his de&s;ign. Thereupon the Father &s;ets his &s;pies; and under&s;tanding by them, that the Governor of St. <HI>Tho|mas</HI> went every Saturday&punc;morning, early to a Chappel upon a Mountain half a league from the City, dedicated to the Virgin-<HI>Mary,</HI> he cau&s;es three Iron-Bars to be fix'd in the window of a little Chamber in the Covent with two good locks to the door, and as many padlocks. And having &s;o done, he goes to the Governor of the Fort, who was an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-man, and a very &s;tout per&s;on; who with thirty Souldiers, and Father <HI>Zenon,</HI> i&s;&s;u'd out of the Fort about midnight, and hid them|&s;elves till day near the Chappel, in a part of the Mountain, where they could not be di&s;cover'd. The Governor of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> came exactly, according to his cu&s;tom, a little after Sun-ri&s;ing; and as &s;oon as ever he alighted from his <HI>Pallequin,</HI> was immediately &s;urpriz'd by the Ambu&s;cade, and carri'd to <HI>Me&s;tipatan,</HI> into the Cham|ber in the Covent which the Friar had provided for him. The Governor thus &s;urpriz'd, made great prote&s;tations again&s;t Father <HI>Zenon,</HI> and threaten'd him with what the King would do when he &s;hould come to hear what he had practis'd again&s;t the Governor of one of his Garri&s;ons. To which Father <HI>Zenon</HI> &s;aid no more, but only that he believ'd that he was better us'd at <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> than Fa|ther <HI>Ephraim</HI> was us'd at the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> whither he had &s;ent him&punc; That if he would obtain liberty for Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> to return, he would leave him in the &s;ame place where they had &s;eiz'd his per&s;on, with as much Ju&s;tice, as he had to &s;end; Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> to <HI>Goa.</HI> Many people came to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, de|&s;iring him to u&s;e his authority for the Governor's liberty. But his an&s;wer was, that the Governor was not in his juri&s;diction, neither could he compel Father <HI>Ze|non</HI> to relea&s;e him, who had been one of the Authors of the injury which had been done his Companion. So that he contented him&s;elf only to de&s;ire of Fa|ther <HI>Zenon</HI> that his Pri&s;oner might dineat his Table in the Fort, promi&s;ing him to return him when he &s;hould require his body; a reque&s;t which he ea&s;ily obtain'd&punc; but could not &s;o ea&s;ily keep his word. For the Drummer of the Garri&s;ion being a <HI>French</HI>-man, with a Merchant of <HI>Mur&s;eilles,</HI> call'd <HI>Roboli,</HI> then in the Fort, two days after came to the Governor, and promis'd him, for a good reward, to pro|cure his e&s;cape. The agreement being made, the Drummer in the morning beat the <HI>Reveillez</HI> &s;ooner than he was wont to do, and lowder, while <HI>Roboli</HI> and the Go|vernor let them&s;elves down at a corner of a <HI>Ba&s;tion</HI> that was not very high; and were pre&s;ently as nimbly follow'd by the Drummer; &s;o that <HI>Madre&s;patan</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> being but half a league a&s;under, they were all three in the Town before their e&s;cape was known. The whole City greatly rejoyc'd at the return of their Governor, and immediately di&s;patch'd away a Barque to <HI>Goa</HI> to carry the news. The Drummer al&s;o and the Merchant &s;et &s;ail at the &s;ame time, and when they came to <HI>Goa</HI> with Letters of recommendation in their behalf, there was no Hou&s;e or Covent which did not make them Pre&s;ents: The <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> al&s;o him&s;elf care&s;s'd them extremely, and took them into his own Ship to have carri'd them into <HI>Por|tugal</HI> along with him; but both he and the two <HI>French</HI>-men dy'd at Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="200">
Never did any Vice-Roy depart from <HI>Goa</HI> &s;o rich as <HI>Don Philippo de Ma&s;careg|nas;</HI> for he had a great parcel of Diamonds, all large &s;tones, from ten <HI>Carats</HI> to forty. He &s;hew'd me two when I was at. <HI>Goa,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> whereof weigh'd 57 <HI>Carats,</HI> the other 67 and an half; clean Stones, of an excellent water, and cut after the <HI>In|dian</HI> manner. The report was that the Vice-Roy was poi&s;on'd in the Ship, and that it was a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of Heaven, for that he had poi&s;on'd &s;everal others, e&s;pecially when he was Governor of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> He had always mo&s;t exqui&s;ite poi|&s;ons by him, to make u&s;e of when his revenge requir'd it: for which rea&s;on, ha|ving rais'd him&s;elf many enemies, one morning he was found hung in <HI>Effigie</HI> in <HI>Goa;</HI> when I was there in the year 1648.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Impri&s;onment of Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> made a great noi&s;e in <HI>Europe; Mon&s;ieur de Chasteau des Bois,</HI> his Brother complain'd to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour, who pre&s;ently wrote to the King his Ma&s;ter to &s;end a po&s;itive command by the fir&s;t Ships, that Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;hould be di&s;charg'd. The Pope al&s;o wrote, declaring that he would excommunicate all the Clergy of <HI>Goa,</HI> if they did not &s;et him at liberty. But all this &s;ignify'd nothing. So that Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> was be|holding for his liberty to none but the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> who had a love for him, and would&punc; have had him have &s;taid at <HI>Bagnagar.</HI> For the King was then at Wars with the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> and his Army lay round about St. <HI>Thomas's.</HI> Hearing there|fore what a ba&s;e trick the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had plaid with Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> he &s;ent or|ders to his General <HI>Mirgimola</HI> to lay &s;iege to the Town, and put all to Fire and Sword, unle&s;s the Governor would make him a firm promi&s;e that Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;hould be &s;et at liberty in two months. A Copy of this Order was &s;ent to the Governor, which &s;o alarm'd the Town, that they di&s;patch'd away Barque after Barque to pre&s;s the Vice-Roy to u&s;e his endeavours for the relea&s;e of Father <HI>Ephraim.</HI> Thereupon he was releas'd; but though the door were &s;et open, he would not &s;tir, till all the Religious Per&s;ons in <HI>Goa</HI> came in proce&s;&s;ion to fetch him out. When he was at liberty he &s;pent 15 days in the Covent of the Capu|chins. I have heard Father Ephraim &s;ay &s;everal times, that nothing troubl'd him &s;o much all the while of his impri&s;onment, as to &s;ee the ignorance of the Inqui&s;itor and his Council, when they put him any que&s;tion: and that he did not believe that any one of them had ever read the Scripture. They laid him in the &s;ame Chamber, with a <HI>Malte&s;e,</HI> who never &s;pake two words without a de&s;perate oath; and took Tobacco all day, and a good part of the night, which was very offen&s;ive to Father <HI>Ephraim.</HI></P>
<P>When the Inqui&s;itors &s;eize upon any per&s;on, they &s;earch him pre&s;ently; and as for his Goods and wearing-Apparel, it is &s;et down in an Inventory, to be return'd him again in ca&s;e he be acquitted; but if he have any Gold, Silver, or Jewels, that is never &s;et down; but is carri'd to the Inqui&s;itor to defray the expences of the Proce&s;s. They &s;earch'd the Reverend Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> but found nothing in his Cloak-pockets, unle&s;s it were a Comb, an Inkhorn, and two or three Hand|kerchiefs. But forgetting to &s;earch the little Pockets which the Capuchins carry in their &s;leeves toward their armpits, they left him four or five black-lead pens. The&s;e Pencils did him a great kindne&s;s. For the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> calling for &s;uch a deal of Tobacco, which is always cut and ti'd up in white-paper, for the profit of the &s;eller, who weighs both Tobacco and Paper together: the&s;e Papers Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> kept very charily, and with his pencil wrote therein whatever he had &s;tudi'd at any time: though he lo&s;t the &s;ight of one of his eyes, through the darkne&s;s of the Chamber, which had but one window, half a foot &s;quare, and barr'd with iron. They would never &s;o much as lend him a Book, or let him have an end of Candle; but us'd him as bad as a certain Mi&s;creant that had been twice let out already with his Shirt &s;ulphur'd, and at St. <HI>Andrews-Cro&s;s</HI> upon his &s;tomach, in company with tho&s;e that are lead to the Gallows, and was then come in again.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Ephraim</HI> having &s;taid 15 days in the Covent of the Capuchins to re|cover his &s;trength after 20 months impri&s;onment, return'd for <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Golconda,</HI> went to return his humble thanks to the King of <HI>Gol|conda</HI> and his Son-in-law, who had &s;o highly intere&s;s'd them&s;elves for his liberty. The King importun'd him again to &s;tay at <HI>Bagnagar,</HI> but &s;eeing him re&s;olv'd to re|turn to his Covent at <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> they gave him as before, an Oxe, two Ser|vants, and Money for his journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Road from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> through <HI>Cochin,</HI> here de&s;crib'd in the &s;tory of the taking of that City by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter the <HI>Dutch</HI> had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the <HI>Portugals</HI> of whatever they had in <HI>Cey|lan,</HI> they ca&s;t their eyes upon <HI>Cochin,</HI> in the Territories whereof grows the Ba&s;tard Cinnamon, which hinder'd the utterance of <HI>Ceylan</HI> Cinnamon. For the Merchants &s;eeing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> kept up their Cinnamon &s;o dear, bought up that of <HI>Cochin,</HI> which they had very cheap; and that coming into reque&s;t, was tran&s;ported to <HI>Gomron,</HI> and di&s;tributed there among the Merchants that came from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Tartary,</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> from <HI>Georgia, Mingrela,</HI> and all the places from the black Sea. It was al&s;o carried away in great quantities by the Merchants of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> who furni&s;h <HI>Arabia;</HI> as al&s;o by the Merchants of <HI>Me&s;opotamia, Anatolia, Constantinople, Romania, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Po|land.</HI> For in all tho&s;e Countries, they u&s;e it either whole or beaten in mo&s;t of their meats, to heighten the ta&s;te thereof.</P>
<P>The Army which was commanded out of <HI>Batavia</HI> for the Siege of <HI>Cochin,</HI> landed at a place call'd <HI>Belli-Porto;</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had a Fort made of Palm-Trees. It is near to <HI>Cranganor,</HI> a &s;mall City which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took the year before; not being able to take <HI>Cochin</HI> then, though they had made &s;ome attempts upon it. So &s;oon as the Army landed, they march'd within Cannon-&s;hot of the City, there being a River between them and the City. That part where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> encamp'd, is call'd <HI>Belle-Epine,</HI> where after they had fortifi'd them&s;elves, as well as the Nature of the place would permit, they rais'd &s;ome Batteries, which could not much annoy the City, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance. They lay there till they had recruits of more men; for they had but three Ships full, though he that commanded them were one of the brave&s;t Captains of his time. Some few days after, the Governour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> ar|riv'd with two Ships more, and afterwards a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain brought a great number of <HI>Chinglas,</HI> who are the Natives of the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> For the Forces of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not be &s;o con&s;iderable as they are, did they not make u&s;e of the Natives of the Country to fill up the Companies which they bring out of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Natives of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> are good for digging Trenches, and rai&s;ing Batteries, but for a Storm they &s;ignifie little. Tho&s;e of <HI>Amboyna</HI> are good Soldiers, four hundred of which were left at <HI>Belle-Epine.</HI> The Body of the Army took Shipping again, and landed near to <HI>Cochin,</HI> not far from a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> where the <HI>Portugals,</HI> with certain <HI>Malavares,</HI> &s;eem'd to have &s;tay'd a&s;hore for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming: But &s;eeing the Enemy to land with &s;o much re&s;olution, they only gave them one Volly and retreated. In their March the <HI>Hollanders</HI> de&s;cry'd certain Companies of <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> near the Sea-&s;hore, others &s;omewhat farther up in the Land, in a Church call'd St. <HI>Johns.</HI> Thereupon they &s;ent out &s;ome Hor&s;emen to di&s;cover their number; but the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;till retreated, after they had &s;et fire to the Church. Thereupon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made their approaches to the Town; and after they had be&s;ieg'd it for &s;ome time, a <HI>French</HI> Soldier, who was under their pay, &s;eeing a Pannier ty'd at the end of a Cord, hanging over one of the Ba&s;tions, ventur'd not|with&s;tanding all the Bullets that flew about his Ears, to &s;ee what was in it. But he was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd, to find nothing but a langui&s;hing Infant, which the Mother had hung there, that &s;he might not &s;ee it peri&s;h for hunger. The Soldier mov'd to compa&s;&s;ion, took the Infant and gave it &s;uch as he had to eat; at which the <HI>Dutch</HI> General was &s;o incens'd, &s;aying that the Soldier &s;hould have let the Infant peri&s;h, that he call'd a Council of War, where he would have had the Soldier run the Gauntlet, which was very cruel; but the Coun|cil moderating the &s;entence, condemn'd him only to the Strappado.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day ten Soldiers out of every Company were commanded to go to one of the Hou&s;es of the King of <HI>Cochin;</HI> but they found no body there,

having plunder'd it the year before. At which time the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ew four Kings of the Country, and &s;ix hundred Blacks; nor did there e&s;cape but only one ancient Queen, who was taken alive by a common Soldier, call'd <HI>Van Rez,</HI> whom the Commander of the Army made a Captain immediately, for his re|ward. They left one Company in that Hou&s;e; but the Queen &s;tay'd there but &s;ix days, for they gave her into the cu&s;tody of <HI>Savarin,</HI> one of the mo&s;t potent of the petty Kings upon that Coa&s;t, to whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had promis'd to give the City of <HI>Cranganor,</HI> if they took <HI>Cochin,</HI> provided he would be faith|ful to them.</P>
<P>Six weeks pa&s;s'd ere any thing con&s;iderable was done; but then the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> &s;torming the Town by night, were repuls'd, and lo&s;t abundance of men, &s;lain and taken Pri&s;oners, through the Governour of <HI>Cranganors</HI> fault, who commanded them, and was drunk when the a&s;&s;ault was made. Two months after, the General of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> re&s;olv'd to make another a&s;&s;ault in the &s;ame place; and becau&s;e he would not want men, he &s;ent for tho&s;e that lay upon the &s;ide of <HI>Belle-epine.</HI> But by misfortune the Frigat &s;truck upon the Sands, and &s;plitting, abundance of the Soldiers were drown'd. They that could &s;wim, got to land near <HI>Cochin,</HI> not finding any either other place convenient, and were all taken Pri&s;oners by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> being not above ten in all, Soldiers and Mariners. The General however would not give over the a&s;&s;ault, but cau&s;ing the Sea-men to land, he arm'd &s;ome with half-Pikes, others with Swords, to others he gave hand-Granadoes, and about ten a Clock in the morning he began the a&s;&s;ault, with four Companies, con&s;i&s;ting each of a hundred and fifty men. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> lo&s;t abundance of men in this la&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and &s;o did the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI> for they defended them&s;elves &s;toutly, being &s;econded by two hundred Soldiers, who were all <HI>Dutch</HI>-men, tho they &s;ided with the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e their Countrymen had abated them &s;ix months and a half pay for the lo&s;s of <HI>Touan.</HI> Without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e Soldiers, the City had never held out two months, there being among them one of the be&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Engineers of his time, who had left his Countrymen by rea&s;on of their ill u&s;age of him.</P>
<P>At length the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having enter'd the Town toward evening, on <HI>Cali|vete</HI> &s;ide, and being Ma&s;ters of the chief Bulwark, the <HI>Portugals</HI> came to a Capitulation, and the City was &s;urrender'd. The <HI>Portugals</HI> by their Articles march'd out of <HI>Cochin</HI> with their Arms and Baggage; but when they came out of the City where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were drawn up in <HI>Battalia,</HI> they were all forc'd to quit their Arms, and to lay them at the Generals feet; except the Officers, who kept their Swords. The General had promis'd the Soldiers the Pillage of the Town, but not being able to keep his word, for &s;everal plau&s;ible rea&s;ons which he told, he promis'd them &s;ix months pay, which in a few days after was reduc'd to eight Roupies a man. <HI>Samarin</HI> al&s;o demanded of him the City of <HI>Cranganor,</HI> according to his promi&s;e; which the General made good; but he caus'd all the Fortifications to be &s;lighted fir&s;t, and left <HI>Samarin</HI> nothing but the bare Walls. For being of a very mean Extraction, he was naturally as cruel and barbarous in his di&s;po&s;ition. One time the Souldiers being &s;o put to it for four days together, that they could get no food for money, two of them had &s;omewhere taken a Cow and kill'd her; for which the General, when he came to know of it, caus'd one of them to be hang'd immediately, and had or|der'd the other to have run the Gauntlet, had not King <HI>Perca</HI> interceded for him.</P>
<P>King <HI>Perca,</HI> was a petty King of that Countrey, with whom the General was then in Treaty; and the Treaty being at length concluded, the General mu&s;ter'd all his Land and Sea-men, to the number of about &s;ix thou&s;and men. A few days after, he &s;ent &s;ome Companies to be&s;iege the City of <HI>Cananor,</HI> which &s;ur|render'd without any re&s;i&s;tence. When they return'd, the General caus'd a Crown to be made for the new King of <HI>Cochin,</HI> the other being expell'd his Countrey.

<PB N="90" REF="202">
were very &s;mall. The King and the King-maker were both alike. For no doubt it could not but be a plea&s;ant fight, to &s;ee a <HI>Hollunder,</HI> that had been only the Cook of a Ship, crowning a mi&s;erable Pirat with tho&s;e hands that had oft'ner handled a Ladle than a Sword.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Ships that carried the Inhabitants of <HI>Cochin</HI> to <HI>Goa;</HI> return'd laden with the &s;poils of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people; for contrary to the Articles of Capitulation, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were no &s;ooner out at Sea, but they took from tho&s;e poor Creatures whatever they had, rifling both men and women, without any regard to &s;ex or mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>The General being return'd into <HI>Batavia,</HI> they &s;ent a Governour to <HI>Cochin,</HI> who to make the place the &s;tronger, demoli&s;h'd a great part of the City. But this Governour us'd the greate&s;t rigor imaginable, even toward the Souldiers; he &s;hut them up in the City as if they had been in a Pri&s;on; nor could they drink either. Wine, or <HI>Sury,</HI> or Strong-water, by rea&s;on of the great Impo&s;ts which he laid upon them. <HI>(Sury</HI> is a drink which flows from the Palm-trees.) So that when the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> kept <HI>Cochin,</HI> men might live better for five or &s;ix Sous, than under the <HI>Hollander</HI> for ten. This Governour was &s;o &s;evere, that he would bani&s;h a man for the &s;malle&s;t fault in the world, to the I&s;land of <HI>Cey|lan,</HI> to a place where they made Brick, &s;ometimes for five or or &s;ix years, &s;ome|times as long as the party liv'd. For it is oftentimes ob&s;erv'd, that when any one is bani&s;h'd thither, though the &s;entence be only for a term of years, yet the Exile never obtains his freedom afterwards.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pa&s;&s;age by Sea from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Departed from <HI>Gomron</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> the eleventh of <HI>May,</HI> 1652, and went aboard a great Ve&s;&s;el of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s, which is bound every year from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> laden with fine Calicuts, Chites, or Calicuts painted with a Pencil, which makes them much more beautiful and dearer than tho&s;e which are printed. The <HI>Holland</HI> Company are wont to allow to tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which belong to any of the Kings or Princes of <HI>India,</HI> a Pilot, and two or three Gunners; neither the <HI>Indians</HI> nor <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> being expert in Navigation. In the Ve&s;&s;el where I was aboard there were but &s;ix <HI>Dutch</HI> Mariners at mo&s;t, but above a hundred Na|tives. We failed out of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Golf, with a plea&s;ing and favorable Gale; but we had not &s;ail'd very far before we found the Sea very rough, and the Winds at South-We&s;t, &s;o violent, though full in our Stern, that we were not able to carry out more than one &s;mall Sail. The next day, and for &s;ome days after, the Wind grew more violent, and the Sea more boi&s;t'rous; &s;o that being in the &s;ixteenth Degree, which is the elevation of <HI>Goa,</HI> the Rain, the Thunder, and Lightning, render'd the Tempe&s;t the more terrible; in&s;omuch that we could not carry out any other than our top-&s;ail, and that half furl'd. We pa&s;s'd by the <HI>Maldives</HI> I&s;lands, but were not able to di&s;cern them, be&s;ides that the Ship had taken in very much water in the Hold. For the Ship had lain five months in the Road of <HI>Gomron,</HI> where if the Mariners are not very careful to wa&s;h the Planks that lye out of the water, they will be apt to gape, which cau&s;es the Ship to leak when &s;he is loaden. For which rea&s;on the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> wa&s;h the out&s;ide of their Ships morning and evening. We had in our Ve&s;&s;el five and fifty Hor&s;es, which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had &s;ent as a Pre&s;ent to the King of <HI>Golconda;</HI> and about a hundred Merchants, <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> together, who were Traders to <HI>India.</HI> One whole day and night together there ro&s;e a cro&s;s Wind, &s;o violent, that the Water rowl'd in from Stern to Stern, and the mi&s;chief was, that our Pumps were nought. By good fortune there was a Merchant that had two Bails of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Leather, be&s;ides four or five Sadlers that knew how to &s;ow the Skins, who were very &s;erviceable as well
<PB N="91" REF="202">
to the whole Ship as to them&s;elves. For they made great Buckets of the Skins, four Skins to a Bucket, which being let down from the Ma&s;ts with Pullies, through certain great Holes which were cut in the Deck, drew up a va&s;t quan|tity of Water. The &s;ame day the violence of the Tempe&s;t continuing, there fell three Thunderbolts into the Ship. The fir&s;t fell upon the Bolt&s;prit, and &s;plit it quite in two; and running along upon the Deck, kill'd three men. The &s;econd fell two hours after, and kill'd two men, &s;hooting along as the other did from Head to Stern. The third follow'd pre&s;ently after, the Ma&s;ter, the Ma&s;ters Mate, and my &s;elf &s;tanding together near the main Mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. At what time the Cook coming to ask the Ma&s;ter whether he &s;hould take up the Victuals, the Thun|derbolt took him in the lower part of his Belly, made a little hole, and took off all the Hair as clean as they dre&s;s a Pig with hot water and Ro&s;in, without doing him any more harm. Only when they came to anoint the little hole with Oil of <HI>Coco's</HI> he roar'd out through the &s;harpne&s;s of the pain which he endur'd.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth of <HI>June</HI> in the morning, we di&s;cover'd Land; and ma|king toward it, we found our &s;elves before <HI>Ponte de Galle,</HI> the fir&s;t Town in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had taken from the <HI>Portugals.</HI> From thence to the Road of <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> we had very good weather; where we ar|riv'd the &s;econd of <HI>July,</HI> an hour or two after Sun-&s;et. There I went a&s;hore, and was mo&s;t civilly treated by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident, and Merchants, as al&s;o by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The eighteenth and nineteenth of <HI>June,</HI> the Sieur <HI>Du Jardin</HI> and I, bought us two <HI>Palleki's,</HI> and &s;ix Oxen to carry our &s;elves, our Servants, and our Luggage. Our de&s;ign was to have gone directly to <HI>Golconda,</HI> there to have &s;old the King a parcel of long Pearls, the lea&s;t whereof weigh'd thirty-four Carats, and the bigge&s;t thirty-five, with &s;ome other Jewels, the mo&s;t part whereof were Emraulds. But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a&s;&s;uring us, that our journey would be to no purpo&s;e, in regard the King would buy nothing that was rare, or of a high price, till <HI>Mir|gimola,</HI> his General and prime Mini&s;ter of State, had view'd the Commodity; under&s;tanding therefore, that he was then at the Siege of <HI>Gandicot,</HI> in the Pro|vince of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> we re&s;olv'd to go thither to him.</P>

<P>WE &s;et forth from <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> the twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> about five of the Clock in the Evening.</P>
<P>The next day, being the one and twentieth, we travell'd three Leagues, and lay at a Village call'd <HI>Nilmol.</HI></P>
<P>The two and twentieth, we travell'd &s;ix Leagues, to <HI>Wouhiz,</HI> another Village; cro&s;&s;ing the River upon a floating Bridg, before we came thither.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth, after we had travel'd &s;ix hours, we came to <HI>Pate|met,</HI> a pitiful Village, where we were con&s;train'd to lye three days by rea|&s;on of the Rains.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh, we came to a great Town, call'd <HI>Bezouart;</HI> not being able to travel above a League and a half, becau&s;e the Road was overflow'd. There we were forc'd to &s;tay four days, for the Rains had &s;o &s;well'd the Ri|ver which we were to cro&s;s, that the Ferryman could not govern his Boat a|gain&s;t the violence of the Stream. There we al&s;o left the Hor&s;es which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;ent to the King of <HI>Golconda;</HI> which by that time were reduc'd to fifty.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="203">
While we &s;tay'd at <HI>Bezouart,</HI> we went to &s;ee &s;everal Pagods, of which the Country is full; there being more than in any other part of <HI>India;</HI> for unle&s;s it be the Governours of Towns; and &s;ome of their Dome&s;ticks, all the re&s;t of the Inhabitants are Idolaters. The Pagod belonging to the Town of <HI>Bezouart,</HI> is a very large one, but not clos'd with Walls; it con&s;i&s;ts of fifty-two Pillars twenty foot high, that uphold a flat roof of Free-&s;tone&punc; they are adorn'd with &s;everal embo&s;s'd Figures of ugly Devils, and &s;everal &s;orts of Creatures. Some of tho&s;e Devils are made with four Horns, others with many Legs and many Tails, others lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ing out their Tongues, and others in &s;everal other ridiculous po&s;tures. The &s;ame Figures are cut in the Stone of the Roof, and between the Pillars &s;tand the Statues of their Gods upon Pede&s;tals. The Pagod is built in the mid&s;t of a Court, of a greater length than breadth, encompa&s;s'd with Walls&punc; which are adorn'd within and without, with the &s;ame Figures as the Pagod; and a Gallery uphold by &s;ixty-&s;ix Pillars, runs round the Wall, after the manner of a Cloy&s;ter. You enter into this Court through a wide Portal, upon which are two Niches, one above another, the fir&s;t uphold by twelve, the other by eight Pillars. At the bottom of the Pillars of the Pagod, are certain old <HI>Indian</HI> Characters, of which the Prie&s;ts of tho&s;e Idolaters them&s;elves can hardly tell the meaning.</P>
<P>We went to &s;ee another Pagod, built upon a Hill, to which there is an a&s;|cent of a hundred and ninety-three &s;teps, every one a foot high. The Pagod is four-&s;quare, with a Cupola at the top; and has the &s;ame embo&s;s'd Figures, as the Pagod of <HI>Bezouart,</HI> round about the Walls. In the middle there is an Idol &s;itting cro&s;s-leg'd, after the manner of the Country; and in that &s;itting po&s;ture it is about four foot high; upon the Head it has a Triple Crown, from which four Horns extend them&s;elves; and it has the face of a man, turn'd to|ward the Ea&s;t. The Pilgrims that come out of devotion to the&s;e Pagods, when they enter, cla&s;p their hands together, and rear them up to their foreheads; then they advance toward the Idol, to&s;&s;ing their two hands &s;o cla&s;pt together, and crying out &s;everal times <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>God, God.</HI> When they come near, they ring a little Bell that hangs upon the Idol it &s;elf, after they have be&s;mear'd the Face, and &s;everal parts of the Body, with &s;everal &s;orts of Painting. Some there are that bring along with them Viols of Oil, with which they anoint the Idol; and be&s;ides, they make an Offering to it of Sugar, Oil, and other things proper to be eaten; the richer &s;ort al&s;o adding pieces of Sil|ver. There are &s;ixty Prie&s;ts that belong to the Idol, and maintain them&s;elves, their Wives and Children upon the Offerings brought to the Idol. But to the end the Pilgrims may believe the Idol takes them, the Prie&s;ts let them lye two days, and the third day in the evening they take them away. When any Pilgrim goes to a Pagod, to be cur'd of any di&s;temper, he brings the Figure of the Member affected made either in Gold, Silver, or Copper, according to his quality, which he offers to his god; and then falls a &s;inging, as all the re&s;t do, after they have offer'd. Before the Gate of the Pagod, there is a flat Roof, upheld by &s;ixteen Pillars, and right again&s;t it, is another upheld by eight; which &s;erves for the Prie&s;ts Kitchin. On the South-&s;ide there is a large Plat|form cut in the Mountain, where there is a plea&s;ing &s;hade of many fair Trees, and &s;everal Wells digg'd in the ground. Pilgrims come far and near to this Pagod; and if they be poor, the Prie&s;ts relive them with what they receive from the rich, that come there out of devotion. The great Fea&s;t of this Pa|god is in the month of <HI>October,</HI> at which time there is a great concour&s;e of people from all parts. While we were there, there was a Woman that had not &s;tirr'd out of the Pagod for three days together; and her prayer to the Idol was, &s;ince &s;he had lo&s;t her Husband, to know what &s;he &s;hould do to bring up her Children. Thereupon asking one of the Prie&s;ts, wherefore &s;he had no an&s;wer, or whether &s;he was to have any an&s;wer or no; he told me, that &s;he mu&s;t wait the plea&s;ure of their God, and that then he would give her an an|&s;wer to what &s;he expected. Upon this I mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;ome cheat, and to di&s;co|ver it, I re&s;olv'd to go into the Pagod when all the Prie&s;ts were ab&s;ent at Dinner, there being only one that &s;tood at the Gate, whom I &s;ent to fetch me &s;ome water at a Fountain two or three Musket-&s;hot from the place. During that
<PB N="93" REF="203">
time I went in, and the Woman hearing me, redoubled her cries; for there being no light in the Pagod, but what comes in at the door, it is very dark. I felt my way to the Idol, and by the glimmering light ob&s;erv'd an hole behind the Idol. I could not do this &s;o quickly, but that the Prie&s;t return'd before I had done, He cur&s;t me for prophaning his Temple, as he call'd it. But we became &s;uddenly very good friends by the mediation of two Roupies which I put into his hands, where|upon he pre&s;ently pre&s;ented me with &s;ome of his <HI>Betl&eacute;</HI></P>
<P>The one and thirtieth, we departed from <HI>Bezouart,</HI> and pa&s;t the River which runs to the Mine of <HI>Gani</HI> or <HI>Coulour.</HI> It was then neer half a league broad, by rea&s;on of the great Rains which had fall'n continually for eight or nine days to|gether. After we had travell'd three leagues on the other &s;ide of the River <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> came to a great Pagod built upon a large Platform, with an a&s;cent of 15 or 20 &s;teps. Within it &s;tood the Figure of a Gow, all of very black-Marble&punc; and a number of deformed Idols four or five-foot-high; &s;ome having many heads, others many hands and legs: and the mo&s;t ugly are mo&s;t ador'd, and receive mo&s;t Offerings.</P>
<P>A quarter of a league from this Pagod is a large Town; but we travell'd three leagues farther, and came to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> at another Town, call'd <HI>Kab-Kali,</HI> neer to which there is a &s;mall Pagod, wherein there &s;tand five or &s;ix Idols of Marble very well|made.</P>

The way to this Town is clos'd on each &s;ide with &s;trong Walls, and at &s;uch and &s;uch di&s;tances are built certain round Towers of little or no defence. This City toward the Ea&s;t &s;tretches out to a Mountain about a league in compa&s;s, and &s;urrounded with Walls. At the di|&s;tance of every 150 paces, there is as it were an half-Moon, and within the Walls are three Fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, we travell'd &s;ix leagues, and lay at a Village call'd <HI>Copenour&punc;</HI></P>
<P>The third day, after we had travell'd eight leagues, we came to <HI>Adanquige,</HI> a very fair Town, where there is a very large Pagod, with abundance of Chambers which were built for the Prie&s;ts; but are now gone to ruine. There are al&s;o in the Pagod certain Idols, but very much maim'd, which the People however very &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly adore.</P>
<P>The fourth, we travell'd eight leagues, and came to lie at the Town of <HI>No&s;|drepar.</HI> Half a league on this &s;ide there is a great River; but at that time it had but little water in it; by rea&s;on of the drowth.</P>
<P>The fifth, after eight leagues journey we lay at <HI>Condecour.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ixth, we travell'd &s;even hours, and lay at a Village call'd <HI>Dakije.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eventh, after three leagues journey we came to <HI>Nelour,</HI> where there are many Pagods, and having cro&s;s'd a great River, a quarter of a league farther, we travell'd &s;ix leagues, and came to <HI>Gandaron.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth, after a journey of eight hours we lay at <HI>Serepl&eacute;,</HI> a &s;mall Vil|lage.</P>
<P>The ninth, we travell'd nine leagues, and lay at a good Town call'd <HI>Ponter.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth, we travell'd eleven hours, and lay at <HI>Senepgond,</HI> another good Town.</P>
<P>The eleventh, we went no farther than <HI>Palicat,</HI> which is but four leagues from <HI>Senepgond;</HI> and of tho&s;e four leagues we travell'd above one in the Sea, up to the Saddles of our Hor&s;es in water. There is another way, but it is the farther about by two or three leagues. <HI>Palicat</HI> is a Fort that belongs to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that live upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel;</HI> and where they have their chief Factory, where lives al&s;o the chief Intendent over all the re&s;t that are in the Territories of the King of <HI>Golconda.</HI> There are u&s;ually within the Fort 200 Souldiers, or there|abouts, be&s;ides &s;everal Merchants that live there upon the account of Trade; and &s;everal others, who having &s;erv'd the Company according to their agreement, retire to that place. There al&s;o dwell &s;ome of the Natives of the Country; &s;o that <HI>Palicat</HI> is now as it were a little Town. Between the Town and the Ca&s;tle there is a large di&s;tance of ground, le&s;t the Fort &s;hould be annoid by &s;hot from the Town. The Ba&s;tions are well-&s;tor'd with good Guns: And the Sea comes up to the very Wall of it; but there is no Haven, only a Road. We &s;taid in the

Town till the next day in the evening, where we ob&s;erv'd, that when the Inhabi|tants fetch their water to drink, they &s;tay till the Sea is quite out, and then dig|ging holes in the Sand as neer the Sea as they can, they meet with fre&s;h|water.</P>
<P>The twelfth, we departed from <HI>Calicat,</HI> and the next morning about ten of the clock we came to <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> having travell'd not above &s;even or eight leagues that day. We lay at the Covent of <HI>Capuchins,</HI> at what time Father <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and Father <HI>Zenon</HI> were both there.</P>
<P>The fifteenth, we went to St. <HI>Thomas's</HI> Town, to &s;ee the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>-Friars, and the Je&s;uits Church, in the fir&s;t whereof is an Iron-lance, wherewith they &s;ay that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> was Martyr'd.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth, in the morning we departed from <HI>Madre&s;patan,</HI> and after a journey of five leagues we arriv'd at a large Town call'd <HI>Serravaron.</HI></P>
<P>The three and twentieth, after 7 leagues travel, we came to <HI>Oudecot,</HI> the whole days journey being over a flat &s;andy Countrey. On each &s;ide there are only Cop&s;es of <HI>Bambou's</HI> that grow very high. Some of the&s;e Cop&s;es are &s;o thick, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible for a man to get into them; but they are pe&s;ter'd with prodigious num|bers of Apes: Tho&s;e that breed in the Cop&s;es upon one &s;ide of the way, are ene|mies to them that are bred on the other &s;ide; &s;o that they dare not cro&s;s from one &s;ide to the other, but they are in danger of being immediately &s;trangl'd. Here we had good &s;port by &s;etting the Apes together by the ears; which is done after this manner. This part of the Country, at every leagues end, is clos'd up with Gates and Barr icado's where there is a good Guard&punc; kept, and where all Pa&s;|&s;engers are examin'd whither they go, and whence they come; &s;o that men may &s;afely travel there with their Money in their hands. In &s;everal parts of this Road there is Rice to be &s;old; and they that would &s;ee the &s;port, cau&s;e five or &s;ix Baskets of Rice to be &s;et in the Road&punc; &s;ome forty or fifty paces one from the other, and clo&s;e by every Basket they lay five or &s;ix battoons about two-foot-long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide them&s;elves: pre&s;ently they &s;hall &s;ee the Apes on both &s;ides of the way de&s;cend from the tops of the <HI>Bambou's,</HI> and advance toward the Baskets which are full of Rice: They are about half an hour &s;hewing their teeth one at the other before they come near the Baskets; &s;ometimes they advance, then retreat again, being loath to encounter. At length the female-Baboons, who are mo&s;t couragious than the males, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that have young ones, which they carry in their arms, as woman do their Chil|dren, venture to a approach the Basket, and as they are about to put in their heads to eat, the males on the other &s;ide advance to hinder them. Immediately the other party comes forward, and thus the feud being kindled on both &s;ides, they take up the Battoons that lie by the Baskets, and thra&s;h one another in good earne&s;t. The weake&s;t are con&s;train'd to flie into the wood with their pates bro|ken, and their limbs maim'd; while the Ma&s;ters of the Field glut them&s;elves with Rice. Though it may be, when their bellies are full, they will &s;uffer &s;ome of the female-party to come and pertake with them.</P>
<P>The four and twentieth, we travell'd nine leagues, all the way being like the Road the day before, as far as <HI>Naraveron.</HI></P>
<P>The five and twentieth, after a journey of eight hours, through a Countrey of the &s;ame nature, meeting at every two or three leagues end with Gates and Guards, we came in the evening to <HI>Gazel.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ix and twentieth, we travell'd nine leagues, and came to lie at <HI>Courva,</HI> where there was nothing to be found neither for Man nor Bea&s;t, &s;o that our Cat|tel were forc'd to be contented with a little Gra&s;s, which was cut on purpo&s;e for them. <HI>Courva</HI> is only a celebrated Pagod; by which, at our arrival, we &s;aw &s;e|veral bands of Souldiers pa&s;s by, &s;ome with Half-pikes, &s;ome with Muskets, and &s;ome with Clubs, who were going to joyn with one of the principal Comman|ders of <HI>Mirgimola's</HI> Army, who was encamp'd upon a ri&s;ing-ground not far from <HI>Courva;</HI> the place being plea&s;ant and cool, by rea&s;on of the great number of Trees and Fountains that grace it. When we under&s;tood the Captain was &s;o neer, we went to wait upon him, and found him &s;itting in his Tent with many Lords of the Country all Idolaters. After we had pre&s;ented him with a pair of Pocket-Pi&s;tols
<PB N="95" REF="204">
inlaid with Silver, he demanded of us what had brought us into that Countrey; but when we told him that we came to attend <HI>Mirgimola, Generali&s;|&s;imo</HI> of the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Army, about bu&s;ine&s;s, he was infinitely kind to us: However, under&s;tanding that he took us for Hollanders, we told him we were not <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but <HI>French</HI>-men. Thereupon, not under&s;tanding what Nation we were, he fell into a long di&s;cour&s;e with us about the Government of our Coun|trey, and the Grandeur of our King. Six or &s;even days before, they had taken five or &s;ix Elephants, three whereof had e&s;cap'd, having kill'd ten or twelve of the Natives who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the Chace; in pur&s;uit whereof the General was prepa|ring; and becau&s;e we could not &s;tay to &s;ee the &s;port, we were contented to inform our &s;elves of the manner of hunting that va&s;t Animal; which is thus. They cut out &s;everal Alleys or Walks in the Wood, which they dig full of great deep holes, and cover with Hurdles &s;trow'd over with a little earth. Then the Hunters hoop|ing and hollowing, and beating up Drums, with Pikes that have Wild-fire ti'd to the end of them, force the Elephant into tho&s;e Walks, where he tumbles into the holes, not being able to ri&s;e again. Then they fetch Ropes and Chains: and &s;ome they bring under their bellies, others they wind about their legs and trunk, and when they think they have &s;ufficiently hamper'd the Bea&s;t, they have certain En|gines ready, wherewithal to draw him up. Neverthele&s;s, of five, three e&s;cap'd, notwith&s;tanding the cords and chains about their bodies and their legs. The people told us one thing which &s;eem'd very wonderful; which was, that the&s;e Elephants having been once deceiv'd, and having e&s;cap'd the &s;nare, are very mi&s;tru&s;t|ful ever after; and when they get into the Wood again, they break off a great bough from one of the Trees with their trunk, with which they examine every &s;tep they go, before they &s;et down their feet, to try whether there be any hole or no in their way. So that the Hunters that told us the Story, &s;eem'd to be out of hopes of ever taking tho&s;e three Elephants which had e&s;cap'd. Had we been a&s;&s;ur'd that we might have been eye-witne&s;&s;es of this miraculous precaution of the Elephant, we would have &s;taid three or four days, what-ever urgent bu&s;ine&s;s we had had. The Captain him&s;elf was a kind of a <HI>Brigadeer,</HI> that commanded three or four-thou&s;and men, who were quarter'd half a league round the Countrey.</P>
<P>The &s;even and twentieth, after two hours travel, we came to a great Village, where we &s;aw the two Elephants which had been &s;o lately taken. Every one of the two wild Elephants was plac'd between two tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants &s;tood &s;ix men, with every one an Half-pike in their hands, and a lighted-Torch fa&s;ten'd at the end of the Pike, who talk'd to the Bea&s;ts, giving them meat, and crying out in their language, <HI>Take it, eat it.</HI> The food which they gave them was a little bottle of Hey, &s;ome pieces of brown-Sucre, and Rice boil'd in water, with &s;ome few corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refus'd to do as they were bidden, the men made &s;igns to the tame Elephants to beat them, which they did, banging the refractory Elephant upon the head and forehead with their trunks; and if he offer'd to make any re&s;i&s;tence, the other Elephant thwackt him on the other &s;ide; &s;o that the poor Elephant, not knowing what to do, was con|&s;train'd to learn obedience.</P>
<P>Being thus fall'n into the Story of Elephants, I will add &s;ome other ob&s;erva|tions, which I have made upon the nature of tho&s;e Animals. Though the Ele|phant never meddles with the female, after he is once taken, yet he is &s;ometimes &s;eiz'd with a kind of lu&s;tful rage. One day that <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> was an Hunting upon one of his Elephants, with one of his Sons that &s;at by him to fan him, the Ele|phant became &s;o furious by rea&s;on of his lu&s;t, that the Governor who was by no means able to ma&s;ter him, declar'd to the King, that to allay the fury of the Ele|phant, who would el&s;e doubtle&s;s brui&s;e him to pieces among the Trees, there was no way, but for one of the three to forfeit his life: and that he would willingly &s;acrifice his for the &s;afety of the King and the Prince his Son. Only he de&s;ir'd his Maje&s;ty to take care of three &s;mall Children which he mu&s;t leave behind him. Having &s;o &s;aid, he threw him&s;elf under the Elephant's-feet, who had no &s;ooner taken him in his trunk and &s;queez'd him to pieces with his feet, but he grew as quiet and peaceable as before. The King, as an acknowledgment for &s;o famous a deliverance, gave to the poor two-hunder'd-thou&s;and Roupies, and highly advanc'd
<PB N="96" REF="205">
every one of the Sons of him that had &s;o generou&s;ly laid down his life for the &s;afety of his Sovereign.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that though the Elephant's skin be very hard while he is alive; yet when he is dead, it is ju&s;t like melted-glue.</P>
<P>Elephants are brought from &s;everal parts of <HI>India;</HI> as from the I&s;land of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y|lan,</HI> where they are very &s;mall; but the mo&s;t couragious of all: from the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> from the Kingdom of <HI>Cochin;</HI> from the Kingdom of <HI>Siam;</HI> and from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <HI>Boutam</HI> neer the Great-<HI>Tartarie.</HI> They are brought al&s;o from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Melinda,</HI> Ea&s;tward of <HI>Affrica:</HI> where they are in very great numbers, according to the report of a <HI>Portugueze</HI>-Captain, made at <HI>Goa,</HI> who came from thence to make &s;ome complaint again&s;t the Governor of <HI>Mo|zambique.</HI> He told me that he had &s;een all along that Coa&s;t &s;everal Parks that were empal'd with nothing but Elephants-teeth, the lea&s;t of which Parks is above a league about: He added farther, that the Blacks of the Country hunt their Elephants, and eat the Fle&s;h. But they are oblig'd to give the tusks of every one they kill to the Lord of the place. When they intend to take their Elephants in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> they make a long lane, clos'd in on both &s;ides, &s;o that the Ele|phant can neither run to the right nor to the left: this lane is broad at the fir&s;t, but grows narrower and narrower, till there is no more room left at the farther-end than for the female-Elephant to lie down, which mu&s;t be one that is covetous of the male at the &s;ame time. Though &s;he be tame, yet &s;he is bound with good Ropes and Cords, and by her cries will call the male-Elephant, who pre&s;ently runs through the lane towards her. Now when the Elephant comes where the lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpo&s;e, immediately barricado up the lane behind, and when he comes neer the female, there is another Barricado &s;et up that &s;tops him from going any farther. When he is thus between the Barricado's, they &s;o entangle his legs and trunk with ropes and cords, that he is &s;oon taken, ha|ving no way to help him&s;elf. The &s;ame way they u&s;e for the mo&s;t part in the Kingdoms of <HI>Siam,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> only that the Natives there mount the female-Elephant, and go to find out the male in the Forre&s;ts. And when they have met with his haunt, they tye the female to the mo&s;t convenient place they can find, and then they fix their &s;nares for the Elephant, who in a &s;hort time ha&s;tens toward the female, hot for Generation, where her cries call him.</P>
<P>This is ob&s;ervable of the female-Elephant, that when &s;he begins to be hot, &s;he gathers together a great heap of herbs and weeds, and makes her &s;elf a kind of bed &s;ome four or five-foot-high from the ground, where contrary to the cu&s;tom of all other creatures, &s;he lies upon her back, in expectation of the male, whom &s;he calls to her by a peculiar cry.</P>
<P>This is al&s;o particular to the Elephants in the I&s;le of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> that only the fir&s;t Elephant which the female produces, has any tusks. And it is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that the Ivory which comes from <HI>Achen</HI> when it is wrought, has this peculiar quality with it, that it never grows yellow, like that which comes out of the Continent, and from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which makes it more e&s;teem'd, and dearer than any other.</P>
<P>When the Merchants bring Elephants to any place to &s;ell, 'tis a plea&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee them go along. For in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by, the children will be running after the little ones to play with them, and give them &s;omething or other to eat. While the young Elephants, which are very wanton, are bu&s;ily taking what is offer'd them, the children leap upon their backs: but when the young Elephants that Iately &s;topt for the lucre of the Victuals perceiving their Dams, a great way before, double their pace, and playing with their trunks, throw the children off their backs to the ground, yet without doing them any harm.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the enquiry I have made, I could never find exactly how long an Elephant will live. Nor can all the Governors and keepers of tho&s;e creatures tell you more, than &s;uch an Elephant has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Father, their Grandfather, and great Grandfather. And by that computation, I found that they had liv'd &s;ome of them &s;ix-&s;core, or an hunder'd and thirty years.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="205">
The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that have made Relations of <HI>India,</HI> boldly affirm that the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> keeps three or four-thou&s;and Elephants. But being my &s;elf at <HI>Jehanabad,</HI> where the King at pre&s;ent re&s;ides, he that was chief Ma&s;ter of the Elephants, a&s;&s;ur'd me that the King had not above five-hunder'd Elephants&punc; which were call'd Elephants of the Hou&s;e, made u&s;e of only to carry the Women, their Tents, and Luggage; but that for the Wars, he only kept four&s;core, or four|&s;core and ten at mo&s;t. The noble&s;t of the latter &s;ort is always re&s;erv'd for the King's Elde&s;t Son, the allowance for his food and other nece&s;&s;aries being 500 Roupies a month, which comes to 750 Livres. There are &s;ome that are not al|low'd above 50, others 40, others, 30, and &s;ome but 20 Roupies. But tho&s;e Ele|phants that are allow'd an hunder'd, two-hunder'd, three-hunder'd or four-hunder'd Roupies a-month, have belonging to them certain Hor&s;e-men that live upon the &s;ame pay, and two or three young fellows to fan them during the heat of the weather. All the&s;e Elephants are not always kept in the City: the greate&s;t part being led out every morning into the fields, or among the thickets, where they feed upon the branches of Trees, Sucre-canes, and Millet, to the great detriment of the poor Country man. But not a little to the profit of their Keepers; for the le&s;s they eat at home, the more they gain into their own pur&s;es.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh of <HI>August,</HI> we travell'd &s;ix leagues, and lay at a great Town call'd <HI>Ragia-peta.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-eighth, after eight leagues journey we came to <HI>Ondecour.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-ninth, after nine hours travel we arriv'd at <HI>Outemeda,</HI> where there is one of the greate&s;t Pagods in all <HI>India.</HI> It is all built of large Free-&s;tone, and it has three Towers, where there &s;tand &s;everal deform'd figures of Embo&s;s'd|work. It is encompa&s;t with many little Chambers for the Prie&s;ts Lodgings: five-hunder'd paces beyond there is a wide Lake, upon the banks whereof are built &s;everal Pagods eight or ten-foot-&s;quare; and in every one an Idol repre&s;enting the &s;hape of &s;ome Devil, with a <HI>Bramer&eacute;,</HI> who takes care that no &s;tranger that is not of their &s;uper&s;tition, &s;hall come to wa&s;h, or take any water out of the Lake. If any &s;tranger de&s;ires any water, they bring it in earthen-pots: and if by chance their pot touches the &s;tranger's Ve&s;&s;el, they break it immediately. They told me al&s;o that if any &s;tranger, not of their &s;uper&s;tition, &s;hould happen by accident to wa&s;h in that Lake, they mu&s;t be forc'd to drain the lake of all the water that was in at that time. As for their alms, they are very charitable; for there pa&s;&s;es by no per&s;on in nece&s;&s;ity, or that begs of them, but they give them to eat and drink of &s;uch as they have. There are &s;everal Women that &s;it upon the Road, whereof &s;ome of them always keep fire for Travellers to light their Tobacco by. Nay, they will give a Pipe to &s;ome that have none at all. Others boil Rice with <HI>Quicheri,</HI> which is a grain &s;omewhat like our Hemp-&s;eed. Others boil Beans with their Rice, becau&s;e the water wherein they are boil'd never puts tho&s;e that are over-hot into a pleuri&s;y. There are Women that have vow'd to perform the&s;e acts of Charity to &s;trangers for &s;even or eight years, &s;ome for more, &s;ome for le&s;s, according to their convenience. And to every Traveller they give &s;ome of their Beans, and Rice-water, and an handful of Rice to eat. There are other Women upon the high-way, and in the fields, looking behind their Hor&s;es, their Oxen, and their Cows, who have made vows never to eat but what they find indige&s;ted in the dung of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts. Now in regard there is neither Barly nor Oats in that Countrey, they give their Cattle certain great crooked Pea&s;e, which they brui&s;e before between two Mill-&s;tones: and then lay them in &s;teep for half an hour; for they are a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">olid &s;ub&s;tance, and hard to be dige&s;ted. They give their Cat|tel the&s;e Pea&s;e every evening; and in the morning they feed them with two pound of dark-brown-Sugar, like Wax, kneaded together with as much Meal, and one-pound of Butter, whereof the O&s;tlers or Grooms make little round Balls which they thru&s;t down their throats; for otherwi&s;e they would never eat them. Afterwards they wa&s;h their mouths, that are all over clamm'd, e&s;pecially their teeth, which makes them have &s;uch an aver&s;ion again&s;t that &s;ort of food. All the day long they pull up the gra&s;s and weeds, by the roots, and give their Cattel, be|ing very careful of letting them eat any of the earth.</P>
<P>The thirty'th, we travell'd eight leagues, and lay at a place call'd <HI>Goulupal&eacute;.</HI></P>

The one and thirty'th, after we had travell'd nine hours, we &s;topt at <HI>Gogeron.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> we travell'd but &s;ix leagues, and came to lie at <HI>Gandicot.</HI> It was but eight days before, that the <HI>Nahab</HI> had taken that City, after a Siege of three months. Nor had it been taken without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of certain <HI>French</HI>-men, who had for&s;aken the &s;ervice of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Company, by rea&s;on of ill-u&s;age. They had al&s;o &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>-Cannoneers, with two or three <HI>Italians,</HI> which mainly forwarded the &s;urrender of that place.</P>
<P><HI>Gandicot</HI> is one of the &s;tronge&s;t Cities in the Kingdom of <HI>Carnatica.</HI> It is &s;itua|ted upon the point of an high Mountain; there being but one a&s;cent to it, not above twenty or five and twenty-foot-broad at mo&s;t; in &s;ome places not above &s;even or eight-foot-wide. On the right-hand of the way, which is cut out of the Mountain, there is a mo&s;t hideous precipice; at the bottom whereof runs a va&s;t River. Upon the top of the Mountain there is a &s;mall plain, but a quarter of a league broad, and about half a league long. This is all &s;ow'd with Rice and Millet, and water'd with many little Springs. The top of the plain on the South|&s;ide, where the City is built, is encompa&s;t with precipices, two Rivers running at the bottom, which form the point. So that there is but one Gate to enter into the City from the plain-&s;ide; and that too fortifi'd with three good walls of Free-&s;tone, with Moats pav'd at the bottom with Free-&s;tone; &s;o that the be&s;ieg'd had but only one quarter of the City to defend, containing about five hunder'd paces. They had but two Iron-Guns, the one carrying twelve-pound-Ball, the other eight. The one was planted upon the Gate, the other upon a point of a kind of a Ba&s;tion. So that until the <HI>Nahab</HI> had found the way to mount his Can|non upon a very high place neer the City, he lo&s;t a great number of men by &s;e|veral &s;allies which the Be&s;ieg'd made. The <HI>Raja</HI> that was within, was e&s;teem'd one of the brave&s;t and mo&s;t experienc'd Captains that ever were among&s;t the Ido|laters: whereupon, the <HI>Nahab</HI> finding that the place was not to be taken, unle&s;s he could get up his Cannon to the top of that &s;teep a&s;cent, &s;ent for all the <HI>French</HI>-men that were in the King's &s;ervice, promi&s;ing to every one four months extraor|dinary pay, if they could find a way to mount his Cannon up to the top of &s;uch a place; wherein they had the good-hap to be very &s;uccesful. For they mounted four pieces of Cannon, and were &s;o pro&s;perous, as to hit the great Gun that was planted upon the Gate, and render it un&s;erviceable. At length, when they had beaten down good part of the Wall of the City, the Be&s;ieged came to capitulate, and march'd out of the Town upon good Articles. The day we arriv'd, all the Army was encamp'd at the foot of the Mountain, in a plain, through which there ran a very fair River; where the <HI>Nahab</HI> mu&s;ter'd his Cavalry, and found them in a very good condition. An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Cannoneer and an <HI>Italian</HI> &s;eeing Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Jardin</HI> and my &s;elf pa&s;s by, gue&s;s'd us to be <HI>Frangui's;</HI> and becau&s;e it was late, acco&s;ted us very civilly, and oblig'd us to &s;tay with them all night. By them we under&s;tood that there was in the City a <HI>French</HI>-Engineer, who&s;e name was <HI>Claudius Maille</HI> of <HI>Bourges,</HI> and that he was employ'd by the <HI>Nahab</HI> to ca&s;t &s;ome pieces of Cannon which the <HI>Nahab</HI> intended to leave in the City.</P>
<P>The next day we went into the City, and found out <HI>Maille</HI>'s Lodging, having been acquainted with him at <HI>Batavia;</HI> who informing the <HI>Nahab</HI> of our arrival, he pre&s;ently &s;ent us Provi&s;ion for our &s;elves and our bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The third day we went to wait upon the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who had pitch'd his Tents up|on that part of the plain neer the place where the way is cut out of the Rock. We inform'd him of the cau&s;e of our coming, telling him that we had &s;ome Com|modities that were rare, and worth the King's buying; but that we were unwil|ling to &s;hew them to the King till he had &s;een them; believing it our duty to render him that re&s;pect. The <HI>Nahab</HI> was very well-pleas'd with our Comple|ment; and after he had caus'd us to be pre&s;ented with <HI>Betl&eacute;,</HI> we took our leaves of him, and return'd to our Lodgings, whither he &s;ent to us two Bottles of Wine, one of Sack, and the other of <HI>Sehiras,</HI> which is a rare thing in that Countrey.</P>
<P>The fourth day we waited upon him again, and carried along with us &s;ome Pearles of an extraordinary weight, beauty and bigne&s;s; the lea&s;t whereof weigh'd twenty four Caratts. After he had vewd them and &s;hew'd them to &s;ome of the Lords that were about him, he ask'd the price, which when we had &s;et him, he return'd us our Jewels and told us he would con&s;ider of it.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="206">
The tenth day he &s;ent for us in the morning, and after he had caus'd us to &s;it down by him, he &s;ent for five &s;mall Bags full of Diamonds, every Bag con|taining a good handful. They were loo&s;e Stones, of a very black Water, and very &s;mall; none of them exceeding a Carat, or a Carat and a half; but other|wi&s;e very clean. There were &s;ome few that might weigh two Carats. After the <HI>Nahab</HI> had &s;hew'n us all, he ask'd us whether they would &s;ell in our Coun|try. We made an&s;wer, that they might have been for &s;ale in our Country, provided they had not been of a black Water; for that in <HI>Europe</HI> we never e&s;teem'd any Diamonds, but &s;uch as were clean and white, having but a &s;mall e&s;teem for any others. It &s;eems, that when he fir&s;t undertook the Conque&s;t of this Kingdom for the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> they inform'd him that there were Dia|mond Mines in it. Whereupon he &s;ent twelve thou&s;and men to dig there; who in a whole years time could find no more than tho&s;e five &s;mall Bags full. Where|upon the <HI>Nahab</HI> perceiving that they could find none but brown Stones, of a Water enclining much more to black than white, thought it but lo&s;s of time, and &s;o &s;ent all the people back to their Husbandry.</P>
<P>The eleventh, the <HI>French</HI> Canoneers came all to the <HI>Nahabs</HI> Tent, com|plaining that he had not paid them the four months pay which he had pro|mis'd them; threatning him, that if he did not di&s;charge it, they would leave him; to which the <HI>Nahab</HI> promis'd to give them &s;atisfaction the next day.</P>
<P>The twelfth, the Canoneers not failing to give him another vi&s;it, the <HI>Nahab</HI> paid them three months, and promis'd to pay them the fourth before the month were out; but &s;o &s;oon as they had receiv'd their Money, they fell a fea&s;ting one another, &s;o that the Dancing Wenches carried away the greate&s;t part of their Coin.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, the <HI>Nahab</HI> went out to &s;ee the Guns which <HI>Maille</HI> had under|taken to ca&s;t. For which purpo&s;e he had &s;ent for Bra&s;s from all parts, and got together a great number of Idols which the Soldiers had pillag'd out of the Pagods as they march'd along. Now you mu&s;t know, that in <HI>Gandi|cot</HI> there was one Pagod, &s;aid to be the faire&s;t in all <HI>India,</HI> wherein there were &s;everal Idols, &s;ome of Gold, and others of Silver; among&s;t the re&s;t there were &s;ix of Bra&s;s, three &s;itting upon their Heels, and three upon their Feet, ten foot high. The&s;e Idols were made u&s;e of among the re&s;t. But when <HI>Maille</HI> al&s;o had provided all things ready, he could not make tho&s;e &s;ix Idols run, that were taken out of the great Pagod of <HI>Gandicot,</HI> though he melted all the re&s;t. He try'd &s;everal ways, but it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to do it, whatever expence the <HI>Nahab</HI> was at; nay though the <HI>Nahab</HI> threaten'd to hang the Prie&s;ts for having inchanted tho&s;e Idols. And thus <HI>Maille</HI> could never make any more than only one &s;ingle piece, and that &s;plit upon trial; &s;o that he was forc'd to leave the work unfini&s;h'd, and &s;oon after left the <HI>Nahabs</HI> &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The fourteenth, we went to take our leaves of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> and to know what he had further to &s;ay to us, concerning the Commodities we had then &s;hew'n him. But then he told us, he was bu&s;ie at pre&s;ent about the examina|tion of certain Offenders which were brought before him. For it is the cu&s;tom of that Country, never to put a man in Pri&s;on; but as &s;oon as the Offender is taken, he is examin'd, and &s;entence is pronounc'd upon him, according to his crime, which is immediately executed; or if the party taken, be found innocent, he is as &s;oon acquitted. And let the controver&s;ie be of what nature it will, it is pre|&s;ently decided.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the morning, we went to wait upon him again, and were im|mediately admitted into his Tent, where he &s;at with his two Secretaries by him. The <HI>Nahab</HI> was &s;itting according to the cu&s;tom of the Country, bare-foot, like one of our Taylors, with a great number of Papers &s;ticking between his Toes, and others between the Fingers of his left hand, which Papers he drew &s;ometimes from between his Toes, &s;ometimes from between his Fingers, &amp; order'd what an&s;wers &s;hould be given to every one. After his Secretaries had wrote the an&s;wers, he caus'd them to read them, and then took the Letters and &s;eal'd them him&s;elf; giving &s;ome to Foot Me&s;&s;engers, others to Hor&s;emen. For you mu&s;t know, that all tho&s;e Let|ters which are &s;ent by Foot-Po&s;ts all over <HI>India,</HI> go with more &s;peed than tho&s;e which are carried by Hor&s;emen. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e at the end of

every two Leagues there are little Huts, where there are men always ready, who are engag'd to run away immediately; &s;o that when one of the&s;e men that carries the Letters, comes to one of the&s;e Huts, he throws the Letters into the Hut, and then he that is appointed, runs with them to the next Stage. They look upon it as an ill Omen, to give the Letters into the Me&s;&s;engers hands; but they mu&s;t be thrown at his feet, and he mu&s;t gather them up. It is to be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that the high ways in mo&s;t parts of <HI>India,</HI> are like Walks of Trees; and that where there are no Trees, at every five hundred paces di|&s;tance there are &s;et up little Heaps of Stones, which the Inhabitants of the next Villages are bound to white-wa&s;h from time to time, to the end tho&s;e Letter-Carriers may not mi&s;s their ways in dark and Rainy nights. While we &s;tay'd with the <HI>Nahab,</HI> certain Officers came to tell him, that they had brought cer|tain Offenders to the door of his Tent. He was above half an hour before he return'd them any an&s;wer, writing on, and giving in&s;tructions to his Secretaries; but by and by, all of a &s;udden he commanded the Offenders to be brought in, and after he had examin'd them, and made them confe&s;s the crime of which they &s;tood accus'd, he was above an hour before he &s;aid a word, &s;till writing on, and employing his Secretaries. In the mean while &s;everal of the Officers of the Army came to tender their re&s;pects to him in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, all whom he an&s;wer'd only with a nod. There was one of the Offenders which were brought before him, had broken into a Hou&s;e, and had kill'd the Mother and three Children. He was condemned upon the &s;pot to have his Hands and Feet cut off, and to be ca&s;t out into the high way, there to end his days in mi&s;ery. Another had rob'd upon the Highway; for which the <HI>Nahab</HI> or|der'd his Belly to be ript up, and him&s;elf to be ca&s;t upon the Dunghill. I know not what crimes the other two had committed, but their heads were both cut off. When we perceiv'd him at a little lei&s;ure, we ask'd him whether he had any other Commands, to lay upon us, and whether he thought our Com|modities fitting to be &s;hew'n to the King. He an&s;wer'd, that we might go to <HI>Golconda,</HI> and that he would write to his Son in our behalf, and that his Letter would be there &s;ooner than we. And in order to our journey, he order'd us &s;ixteen Hor&s;emen to convoy us, and to provide us nece&s;&s;aries upon the Road, till we came to a River, thirteen Leagues from <HI>Gandicot,</HI> which no per&s;ons are to pa&s;s, unle&s;s they have the <HI>Nahabs</HI> Pa&s;sport, to keep the Soldiers from running from their Colours.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Road from <HI>Gandicot</HI> to <HI>Golconda.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ixteenth in the morning, we &s;et out of <HI>Gandicot,</HI> accompanied with the greate&s;t part of the Canoneers, who brought us the fir&s;t days journey up|on our way; and that day having travel'd &s;even Leagues, we came to lye at <HI>Cotepaeli.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth, the Canoneers took their leaves of us; and we kept on our journey with our Hor&s;emen; and having travel'd &s;ix Leagues, we lay at a Village call'd <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">een,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River, which is very broad. So &s;oon as we had cro&s;s'd it, the Hor&s;emen took their leaves of us; and though we made them a pre&s;ent of Roupies, to buy them Tobacco and Betle, yet we could not per&s;wade them to take it. Their Ferry-Boats wherewith they cro&s;s the River, are like broad bottom'd Wicker Flaskets, cover'd without with Oxe's Hides; at the bottom whereof they lay certain Faggots, over which they &s;pread a piece of old Tape&s;try, to keep the Wares and Merchandi&s;e from the wet. As for their Coaches and Waggons, they fa&s;ten them between two Boats, by the Wheels and the Pole; the Hor&s;es &s;wimming all the while, one man whip|ping them on behind, while another in the Boat holds them up by the Head-Stall.
<PB N="101" REF="207">
As for the Oxen that carry the Luggage, as &s;oon as ever they come to the River &s;ide, and that they have unladed them, they only drive them into the River, and they will &s;wim over of them&s;elves. There are four men that &s;tand upright at the four Corners of the Boat, and row it along with broad pieces of Wood, made like Shovels. If they do not all &s;trike their &s;troaks together, but that any of the four mi&s;&s;es, the Boat will turn round two or three times; and the &s;tream carries it a great way lower than where they intended to land.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, after five hours travel we arriv'd at <HI>Morimal.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteenth, we travel'd nine Leagues, and lay at <HI>Sante&s;ela.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth, we travell'd nine Leagues more, and lay at <HI>Goremedae.</HI></P>
<P>The one and twentieth, after &s;ix hours travel, we &s;pent the night at <HI>Kaman,</HI> a Frontier Town in the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> till the Conque&s;t of <HI>Carnatica</HI> by <HI>Mirgimola.</HI></P>
<P>The two and twentieth, we travel'd &s;even Leagues, and came to lye at <HI>Eme|lipata.</HI> When we were about half the way, we met above four thou&s;and per|&s;ons, men and women; and above twenty <HI>Palleki's,</HI> in every one whereof was an Idol. They were adorn'd with Coverings of Sattin, purfled with Gold, and Velvets with Gold and Silver Fringe. Some of the&s;e <HI>Palleki's</HI> were born by four men; others by eight, and &s;ome by twelve, according as the Idols were in bigne&s;s and weight. On each &s;ide of the <HI>Pallekie,</HI> walk'd a man, with a large Fan in his hand, five Foot in compa&s;s, made of O&s;triches and Peacocks Feathers, of various colours. The handle of the Fan was five or &s;ix foot long, laid all over with Gold and Silver, about the thickne&s;s of a <HI>French</HI> Crown. Every one was officious to carry one of tho&s;e Fans, to keep the Flies from the Idols Face. There was another Fan, which was carried clo&s;e by the Idol, &s;omewhat larger than the Former, without a handle, and was born ju&s;t like a Target. It was adorn'd with Feathers of &s;everal colours, and little Bells of Gold and Sil|ver, round about the Edges. He that carried it went always near the Idol upon the &s;ame &s;ide, to &s;hade the Idol; for to have &s;hut the Curtains would have been too hot. Ever and anon, he that carried that &s;ort of Fan, brandi&s;h'd it in the air, to make the Bells ring; which they pre&s;um'd to be a kind of Pa&s;time to the Idol. All the&s;e people with their Idols came from <HI>Brampour,</HI> and the adjacent parts, and were going to vi&s;it their great <HI>Ram,</HI> that is to &s;ay, their chief God, who &s;tands in a Pagod in the Territories of the King of <HI>Carnatica.</HI> They had been about thirty days upon the Road, and were to travel fourteen or fifteen more, before they came to this Pagod. One of my Servants, who was a Native of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and of the &s;ame Super&s;tition, beg'd me to give him leave to bear his gods Company, telling me withall, that he had made a vow long &s;ince to go this Pilgrimage. I was con&s;train'd to let him go. For had I not given him leave, I knew he would have taken it, by rea&s;on he had much acquaintance and kindred among the Rabble. About two months after, he re|turn'd again to us to <HI>Surat,</HI> and becau&s;e he had faithfully &s;erv'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jardin</HI> and my &s;elf, we made no &s;cruple to take him again. Asking him &s;ome que&s;tions about his Pilgrimage, he related to me this following pa&s;&s;age: &s;ix days after he left me, all the Pilgrims had made an account to go and lye at &s;uch a vil|lage, to which before they came they were to cro&s;s a River, that has but little Water in Summer, &s;o that it is ea&s;ily fordable. But when it rains in <HI>India,</HI> the Water falls with &s;uch a force, that it &s;eems to be a perpendicular deluge; and in le&s;s than an hour or two a &s;mall River &s;hall &s;well three or four foot high. The Rains having overtaken tho&s;e Pilgrims, the River was &s;well'd in that man|ner, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s it that day. Now becau&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;ary for Travellers in <HI>India</HI> to carry provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially for the Idolaters, who never eat any thing that ever had life; in regard that in the lea&s;t village you may meet with abundance of Rice, Meal, Butter, Milk Meats, Lentils, and other Pul&s;e, be&s;ides Sugar, and Sweet-Meats, dry and moi&s;t. The people were very much &s;urpriz'd, having no victuals, when they came and &s;aw the River &s;well'd. In &s;hort, they had nothing to give their Children to eat; which caus'd great lamentations among them. In this extremity the chiefe&s;t of their Prie&s;ts &s;at him&s;elf down in the mid&s;t of them, and covering him&s;elf with a &s;heet, began to cry out that.
<PB N="102" REF="208">
they who would have any Victuals &s;hould come to him; when they came, he ask'd every one what they would have, whether Rice, or Meal, and for how many per&s;ons; and then lifting up the corner of the &s;heet, with a great Ladle he di&s;tributed to every one that which they ask'd for; &s;o that the whole multi|tude of four thou&s;and Souls was fully &s;atisfi'd. My Servant did not only tell me this &s;tory, but going &s;everal times afterwards to <HI>Brampour,</HI> where I was known to the chief men in the City, I enquir'd of &s;everal, who &s;wore to me by their <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> that it was truth. Though I am not bound to believe it.</P>
<P>The twenty-third, we arriv'd at <HI>Doupar,</HI> after we had travel'd eight leagues, and cro&s;s'd &s;everal Torrents.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth, we travel'd eight leagues, and came to <HI>Tripante;</HI> where there is a great Pagod upon a Hill, to which there is a circular a&s;cent of Free|&s;tone every way; the lea&s;t Stone being ten foot long, and three broad: and there are &s;everal Figures of <HI>Daemons</HI> in the Pagod. Among&s;t the re&s;t, there is the Statue of <HI>Venus,</HI> &s;tanding upright, with &s;everal la&s;civious Figures about her; all which Figures are of one piece of Marble; but the Sculpture is very ordinary.</P>
<P>The twenty-fifth, we travel'd eight leagues, and came to <HI>Mamli.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;ixth, we travel'd eight leagues more, and came to lye at <HI>Ma|cheli.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh, we travel'd not above three leagues, being to cro&s;s a wide River in Boats like Panniers; which u&s;ually takes up half the day; for when you come to the River &s;ide, there is neither Pannier nor any thing el&s;e to cro&s;s it. There was only one man, with whom we bargain'd for our pa&s;&s;age; who to try whether our money be good or no, made a great fire and threw it into the flame, as he does to all others that pa&s;s that way. If among the Roupies which he receives, he meets with any one that turns a little black, you mu&s;t give him another, which he pre&s;ently heats red hot; when he finds his Money to be good, he calls to his Companions to fetch the Manequin or Flasket-Boat, which lay hid before in &s;ome other part of the River. For the&s;e &s;ort of people are &s;o cunning, that if they de&s;cry any Pa&s;&s;engers afar off, they will row their Manequin to the other &s;ide, becau&s;e they will not be con&s;train'd to carry any per&s;on over without Money. But the Money being paid, the man that receives it; calls his Companions together, who take the Boat upon their Shoulders, and when they have launch'd it into the River, they fetch their Pa&s;&s;engers and goods from the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The twenty-eighth, having travel'd five leagues, we came to a place call'd <HI>Dabir-Pinta.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-ninth, after twelve hours travel, we came to lye at <HI>Holcora.</HI></P>
<P>The thirtieth, we travell'd eight leagues, and came to &s;pend our night at <HI>Pe|ridera.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> after we had travel'd ten leagues, we came to lye at <HI>Atenara.</HI> This is a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, which the pre&s;ent King's Mother caus'd to be built. There are many Chambers in a great <HI>Piazza</HI> belonging to it, for the convenience of Travellers.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t take notice, that in all the Countries where we travel'd as well in the Kingdom of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> as the Kingdoms of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> there are no Phy&s;icians, but &s;uch as attend Kings and Princes. As for the common people, after the Rains are fall'n, and that it is time to gather Herbs, you &s;hall &s;ee every morning the good women of the Towns going into the Fields, to gather &s;uch Simples which they know to be proper for &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as reign in the Family. 'Tis very true, that in great Cities there may be one or two men that have &s;ome common Receipts, who go every morning, and &s;it in &s;ome known places, to give their Remedies to &s;uch as enquire for them, whether they be Potions or Plai&s;ters. Fir&s;t they feel their Pul&s;es, and then giving them &s;ome remedy, for which they do not demand the value of &s;ix pence; they al&s;o at the &s;ame time mutter certain words between their teeth.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> we had but four leagues to travel before we came to <HI>Golconda.</HI> We went immediately to the Lodging of a young <HI>Dutch</HI> Chi|rurgion, belonging to the King, whom the Sieur <HI>Cheteur,</HI> Envoy from <HI>Batavia,</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="208">
had left at <HI>Golconda</HI> upon the King's earne&s;t entreaty. The King was always very much troubl'd with the head-ach: For which rea&s;on the Phy&s;itians had or|der'd that he &s;hould be let blood in four places under the tongue; but there was no per&s;on that would undertake to do it: for the Natives of the Country un|der&s;tand nothing of Chirurgery. Now before that <HI>Peter de Lan,</HI> for that was the <HI>Dutch</HI>&punc;Chirurgion's name, was entertain'd in the King's &s;ervice, he was ask'd whether he could let blood? To which he an&s;wer'd, that there was nothing &s;o ea&s;y in Chirurgery. Some few days after the King &s;ent for him, and gave him to under&s;tand that he was re&s;olv'd to be let blood the next day in four parts un|der the tongue, as the Phy&s;itians had order'd, but he &s;hould take a care of not drawing away above eight ounces. <HI>De Lan</HI> returning the next day to Court, was lead into a Chamber by three Eunuchs, and four Old-women, who carri'd him to a Bath, and after they had undre&s;t him, and wa&s;h'd him, e&s;pecially his hands; they anointed him with Aromatick-drugs, and in&s;tead of his own <HI>European</HI>-Clothes, they brought him a Robe according to the fa&s;hion of the Countrey. After that, they brought him before the King; where he found four little Porringers of Gold, which the Phy&s;itians, who were pre&s;ent, had weigh'd. In &s;hort, he let the King blood under the tongue in four parts, and perform'd his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well, that when the blood came to be weigh'd, it weigh'd but bare eight ounces. The King was &s;o &s;atisfi'd with the Operation, that he gave the Chirur|gion three-hunder'd Pagods, which comes to almo&s;t &s;even-hunder'd Crowns. The Young-Queen and the Queen-Mother under&s;tanding what he had done, were re&s;olv'd to be let-blood too. But I believe it was rather out of a curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Chirurgion, than out of any nece&s;&s;ity which they had to be let-blood. For he was a hand&s;om young-man; and perhaps they had never &s;een a &s;tranger neer at hand, for at a di&s;tence, it is no improbable thing, in regard the Women are &s;hut up in &s;uch places where they may &s;ee, but not be &s;een. Upon this, <HI>de Lan</HI> was carri'd into a Chamber where the &s;ame Old-women that he had waited on him before he let the King blood, &s;tript up his arm, and wa&s;h'd it, but more e&s;pecially his hands; which when they were dry, they rubb'd again with &s;weet-Oils as before. That being done, a Curtain was drawn, and the Queen &s;tretching out her arm through a hole, was let-blood; as was the Queen-Mother afterwards in the &s;ame manner. The Queen gave him fifty Pagods, and the Queen-Mother thirty, with &s;ome pieces of Cloath of Gold.</P>
<P>Two days after we went to wait upon the <HI>Nahab</HI>'s Son, but were told we could not &s;peak with him that day; the next day receiving the &s;ame an&s;wer, we were advertiz'd upon enquiry, that we might wait long enough in that manner; that he was a young Lord that never &s;tirr'd from the King; or that if he did leave the Court, it was only to keep his Mi&s;&s;es company in his own <HI>Haram.</HI> The young Chirurgion &s;eeing us &s;o delaid, offer'd to &s;peak to the King's fir&s;t Phy|&s;itian, who was al&s;o of the King's Council, and who had te&s;tify'd a great affection toward the <HI>Batavian</HI>-Envoy, and for <HI>de Lan</HI> him&s;elf; for which rea&s;on he thought he might embrace an opportunity to do him a kindne&s;s. In &s;hort, <HI>de Lan</HI> had no &s;ooner &s;poke to him, but he &s;ent for us, and having, after much civilty &s;hewn us, inform'd him&s;elf of the cau&s;e of our coming, he de&s;ir'd us to &s;hew him our Pearls, which we did the next day. Aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> he had view'd them, he made us &s;eal them up again in our own bags: for all that is pre&s;ented to the King mu&s;t be &s;eal'd with the Merchants-Seal; and when the King has had a &s;ight of the Com|modity, it is &s;eal'd up with his own Seal, to prevent any fraud. Thereupon we left the Pearls, &s;o &s;eald up, in his hands, who promis'd to &s;hew them to the King, and to give us a good account of the tru&s;t we had put into his hands.</P>
<P>The next day about nine of the Clock before noon we went to the River to &s;ee how they wa&s;h the King's and the Great Noble-men's Elephants. The Ele|phant goes up to the belly in the water, and lying down upon one &s;ide, with his trunk he throws the water &s;everal times upon that &s;ide which lies out of the water; and when he has &s;oak'd him&s;elf &s;ufficiently, the Ma&s;ter comes with a kind of a Pumice-&s;tone, and rubbing the Elephant's-skin, clean&s;es it from all the filth that clings to it. Here &s;ome believe, that when this creature is once laid down, it cannot ri&s;e of its &s;elf; which is contrary to what I have &s;een. For
<PB N="104" REF="209">
when the Ma&s;ter has well-cleans'd the one &s;ide, he commands the Elephant to turn the other, which the bea&s;t immediately does; and when both &s;ides are well-wa&s;h'd, he comes out of the River, and &s;tays a-while upright upon the bank-&s;ide to dry him&s;elf. Then comes the Ma&s;ter with a pot full of &s;ome red or yellow colour, and &s;treaks the be&s;t in the forehead, about the eyes, upon the brea&s;t, and all behind, rubbing him afterwards with Oil of <HI>Coco's</HI> to &s;trengthen the nerves; and &s;ome when all is done, he fa&s;tens a gilt-Plate upon their fore|heads.</P>
<P>The fifteenth, the chief Phi&s;itian &s;ent for us, and return'd us our bags again, &s;eal'd with the King's Signet, wherewith his Maje&s;ty had &s;eal'd them after he had look'd upon them. He demanded the price; which we told him: Whereupon, an Eunuch that &s;tood by him, and wrote down every thing, wondring at the high|price of the Pearls, told us that we took the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Courtiers for per&s;ons that have neither knowledg nor judgment; and that he &s;aw every day things of greater value brought to the King. I briskly retorted upon the Eunuch, that he was better skill'd in the price of a young Slave, than the value of a Jewel; and &s;o &s;aying, we put up our Pearls; and return'd to our Lodg|ing. The next day we &s;et out from <HI>Golconda</HI> for <HI>Surat,</HI> in which Road there is nothing con&s;iderable but what I have already de&s;crib'd, only this is to be re|member'd, that we were not gone above five days journey from <HI>Golconda,</HI> but the King, who had not heard in two days after we were gone, what I had re|torted upon the Eunuch, &s;ent four or five Hor&s;e-men after us with Orders, if they overtook us, to bring us back: but in regard we were got one days journey into the Territories of the <HI>Mogul</HI> before one of the Hor&s;e-men over|took us, (for the re&s;t &s;taid upon the Frontiers of the two Kingdoms;) I, that knew the humour of the Countrey very well, made an&s;wer for my &s;elf and Companion, that at that time our bu&s;ine&s;s would not permit us; and that there|fore we begg'd in mo&s;t humble manner his Maje&s;ty's pardon; and afterwards I made my Companion allow my rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Surat, Mon&s;ieur de Jardin</HI> dy'd of an overflowing of choler. And I made a full account to have gone to <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> who then reign'd. But at the &s;ame in&s;tant the <HI>Nahab, Sha-Est-Kan,</HI> the King's Brother-in-Law, and Governor of the Province of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> &s;ent one of the principal Officers of his Hou&s;e to me from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> to tell me he undre&s;tood I had &s;ome extraor|dinary Jewels to &s;ell; for which rea&s;on he would be glad to &s;ee me, and that he would pay me as much for them as the King &s;hould do. I receiv'd this Me&s;&s;age while <HI>Sieur de Jardin</HI> Iay &s;ick, and the ninth day after his death I got to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> and &s;pake with the <HI>Nahab.</HI> Now in regard he was a man that under&s;tood Jewels perfectly well, we pre&s;ently came to an agreement: &s;o that we had no di&s;pute together, but about the quality of the Coin to be paid. He allow'd me two &s;orts to choo&s;e, Roupies of Gold, or Roupies of Silver: but the Prince &s;eeming to intimate to me that he &s;hould not be well-pleas'd to let &s;uch a Sum in Silver to be &s;een to go out of his Hou&s;e, he wi&s;h'd I would rather accept my payment in Roupies of Gold, that made not &s;uch a great heap. I con&s;ented to his de&s;ire; and he &s;hew'd me very fair Gold, and many Roupies, that had not &s;een the Sun in a long time. But in regard the price currant of a Roupy of Gold, is not above fourteen Roupies of Silver, and for that he would have had me taken my Roupies at fourteen and a half, or at lea&s;t for fourteen and a quarter, it had like to have &s;poil'd our bargain; for I gave him to under&s;tand, that in &s;o large a &s;um, it would not quit co&s;t to lo&s;e a fourth part in every Roupy of Gold. At length to plea&s;e him, I was forc'd to take the Gold at fourteen Roupies of Silver and an eighth part. Thus a Prince otherwi&s;e magnificent and generous, yet in matter of buying and &s;elling, woulds needs approve him&s;elf to be a good Husband. While I &s;tay'd at <HI>Ama|dabat,</HI> he &s;ent me every day to my Lodging four Silver Plates of <HI>Pilaw,</HI> and other excellent Dyet; and one day that the King had &s;ent him as many Apples as ten or twelve men could carry, he &s;ent me as many as for their rarity at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> were worth three or four hundred Roupies. Be&s;ides all this, he gave me a compleat Habit of Honour, with a Sword and a Cangiar, worth a thou&s;and Roupies; and re&s;olving al&s;o to give me a Hor&s;e, he ask'd me what
<PB N="105" REF="209">
kind of one I would have. I told him, &s;ince he was pleas'd to give me my choice, that I rather de&s;ir'd a young lively Hor&s;e, rather than an old one. Thereupon he &s;ent me one that was &s;o given to bounding and prancing, that he threw a young <HI>Hollander</HI> out of the Saddle; but upon my de&s;ire to have him chang'd, he &s;ent me another, which I fold afterwards for four hundred Roupies.</P>
<P>From <HI>Amadabat</HI> I return'd to <HI>Surat;</HI> from <HI>Surat</HI> I travel'd again to <HI>Golconda,</HI> and thence to the Mine to buy Diamonds. From whence returning back for <HI>Su|rat,</HI> I re&s;olv'd for <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>

While I was thus in fear of &s;taying long in a place where I had no bu&s;ine&s;s, there arriv'd at <HI>Surat</HI> five great <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships from <HI>Batavia;</HI> three of which being rather Men of War, than Merchant-Men, were order'd to be un|laden with all &s;peed, with an intention to look out for the four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els that were expected out of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The other two were appointed to follow two or three days after, being in that time to take in provi&s;ions for the whole Fleet.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sickne&s;s and &s;uppos'd Death of <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> King of <HI>India,</HI> and the Rebellion of the Princes his Sons.</HEAD>
<P>THis great King had reign'd above forty years, not &s;o much as a King over his Subjects, but rather as a Father over his Family and Children. In&s;o|much, that during his Reign there was &s;uch a &s;trictne&s;s in the Civil Government, and particularly for the &s;ecurity of the High-ways, that there was never any oc|ca&s;ion to put any man to death for Robbery. In his declining years he fanci'd a young Lady of an extraordinary Beauty, that was not above thirteen years of age; and becau&s;e the &s;trength of nature would not permit him to &s;atisfie his pa&s;&s;ion, he took certain provocatives, which were &s;o hot, that he fell thereupon into a di&s;temper that had almo&s;t kill'd him. This oblig'd him to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his <HI>Haram,</HI> together with his Women, for two or three months; during which time he appear'd very rarely to the people, and that at a great di&s;tance too, which made them believe he was dead. For they are oblig'd by Cu&s;tom to &s;hew them&s;elves to the people three times in a week, or in fifteen days at mo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Cha-Jehan</HI> had &s;ix Children, four Sons and two Daughters. The Name of the elde&s;t was <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> the &s;econd was call'd <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> the third <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> The elde&s;t of his two Daughters was call'd <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> and the name of the &s;econd was <HI>Rauchenara Begum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cha-jehan</HI> lov'd all his four Sons alike, and had made them Governours or Vice-Roys of four of his principal Provinces or Kingdoms. <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> who was the elde&s;t, &s;tay'd with his Father in <HI>Debly,</HI> and had the Government of the King|dom of <HI>Sandi,</HI> into which he put a Deputy. <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had for his &s;hare the Go|vernment of <HI>Bengala. Aureng-zeb</HI> was Vice-Roy of the Kingdom of <HI>Decan;</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Guzerat.</HI> But though <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> endeavour'd to give equal content to his four Sons, their Ambition was not &s;atisfi'd with this di|vi&s;ion, but ruin'd all the good de&s;igns which &s;o kind a Father had lay'd to pre|&s;erve peace among his Children.</P>
<P><HI>Cha-jehan</HI> being thus &s;ick, and retir'd into the Womens quarter, without &s;hewing him&s;elf for many days; the report ran that he was dead, and that <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> conceal'd his death, to gain time to provide for him&s;elf, and to &s;e|cure the Empire. True it is, that the King believing he &s;hould dye, commanded <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> to call together all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords, and to &s;eat him&s;elf upon the Throne, which belong'd to him, as the elde&s;t of his Brothers. He al&s;o te&s;ti|fi'd the de&s;ire he had to &s;ee him quietly &s;ettled in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire. And this intention of his was look'd upon as the more ju&s;t, in re|gard the other three Brothers had been for &s;ome time ob&s;erv'd to have le&s;s re&s;pect for their Father, than <HI>Dara-Cha. Dara-Cha,</HI> who honour'd and re&s;pect|ed the King with a real tenderne&s;s, made an&s;wer to the King, that he de&s;ir'd of Heaven nothing more than the pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ties life, and that &s;o long as Heaven &s;hould continue that pre&s;ervation, he &s;hould take it to be a greater honour to continue him&s;elf a Subject, than to a&s;cend the Throne. And indeed he was never ab&s;ent from his Father, that he might be the better able to &s;erve him in his &s;ickne&s;s; and becau&s;e he would be pre&s;ent upon all occa|&s;ions,

he lay by his Fathers Bed-&s;ide, upon a Tape&s;try &s;pread upon the ground.</P>
<P>During the fal&s;e report of the death of <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> his three other Sons im|mediately rebell'd, every one laying claim to their Fathers Crown. <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> the younge&s;t, who had the Government of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> &s;ent away Forces immediately to be&s;iege <HI>Surat,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Port, and mo&s;t frequented of any other all over <HI>India.</HI> The City made no re&s;i&s;tance, for the Walls are very weak, and broken down in &s;everal places. But they defended the Citta|del, where the Trea&s;ure was, very &s;toutly; though the young Ambitious Prince did all he could to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it. <HI>Chabas-Kan,</HI> one of his Eu|nuchs, who was General of his Army, an indu&s;trious and active per&s;on, and who carri'd on the Siege with all the experience of an old Captain; when he &s;aw he could not carry the Ca&s;tle by main force, caus'd it to be undermin'd in two places, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an <HI>European</HI> Engineer, which took effect; &s;o that upon the twenty-ninth of <HI>December,</HI> 1659, he threw down a good part of the Walls, and fill'd up the Moat; which very much terrifi'd the be&s;ieg'd. But they pre&s;ently recover'd their courage, and though they were but a &s;mall num|ber, they defended them&s;elves for above forty days, to the great Dammage and &s;laughter of <HI>Morat-Bakche's</HI> Army. <HI>Chabas-Kan,</HI> provok'd at &s;uch a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ought for all the Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred of the Canoneers that were within the Ca&s;tle, to place them at the head of his men, when they made their approaches. He al&s;o &s;ent one of the Brothers of the Governour of the place, to offer him advantageous conditions. But the Gover|nor, being a very loyal per&s;on, and uncertain of the Kings death, rejected all his offers. The Eunuch perceiving the Re&s;olution of the Governour, threaten'd the be&s;ieged to kill all their Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred, if they did not &s;urrender the place the next day. But neither did any of tho&s;e con&s;i|derations prevail, till at length the breach being made wider, and the number of defandants decrea&s;ing, the Governor &s;urrender'd upon honourably conditions; which were punctually perform'd by <HI>Chabas-Kan,</HI> who &s;eiz'd upon all the Trea|&s;ure, and carried it to <HI>Amadabat;</HI> where <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> was bu&s;ily employ'd in &s;queezing the people to get Money.</P>
<P>The news of the taking <HI>Surat</HI> being brought to this Prince, he pre&s;ently provided him&s;elf a Throne, and &s;itting upon it on the day which was appointed for the Ceremony, he caus'd him&s;elf to be declared King, not only of <HI>Guze|rat,</HI> but of all the Dominions of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> his Father. At the &s;ame time he al&s;o coin'd Money, and &s;ent Governors into all the Cities. But his tottering Throne, not being well fix'd, fell &s;oon to the Ground; and the younge&s;t of all the Brothers, for having u&s;urp'd a Scepter that no ways appertain'd to him, was confin'd to a &s;evere impri&s;onment. Prince <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> fain would have re|liev'd <HI>Surat;</HI> but it was impo&s;&s;ible. For be&s;ides that he was bu&s;ied in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Father the King, his &s;econd Brother <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> more powerful than <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> found him far more work to do. He was already advanc'd into the Kingdom of <HI>Lahor,</HI> having ab&s;olutely reduc'd the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala.</HI> All that <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> could do, was to &s;end <HI>Soliman Checour</HI> his elde&s;t Son, with an Army again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah.</HI> The young Prince having defeated his Uncle, and driven him back into <HI>Bengala,</HI> the Frontiers whereof he &s;ecur'd with good Gar|ri&s;ons return'd to <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> his Father. In the mean time <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> ac|knowledg'd for King in the Kingdom of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> bends all his Force and Coun|&s;els to make him&s;elf Emperor of the <HI>Indies,</HI> to de&s;troy his Brothers, and to &s;ix his Throne either in <HI>Agra</HI> or <HI>Jehanabat</HI></P>
<P>Whiles the&s;e things pa&s;s'd, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> as ambitious, but more crafty than his Brothers, lets them alone to kindle the fir&s;t Fires; and conceals his own de&s;igns, which afterwards appear'd &s;o much to the damage of the re&s;t. At fir&s;t he feign'd to lay no claim to the Empire, but liv'd a private life, like a <HI>Dervich,</HI> or Religious Hermit. And the better to act his part, he declar'd to his younger Brother <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> whom he &s;aw to be &s;o ambitious, how willing he &s;hould be to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his de&s;igns; telling him, that becau&s;e he merited the Empire by his Valour, he would aid him with his Money and his Forces to overthrow <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> who only &s;tood in his way. The young Prince, blinded with the hopes of his good Fortune, ea&s;ily belive'd <HI>Aureng-zeb.</HI> And
<PB N="110" REF="212">
&s;o joining Forces together, he advances towards <HI>Agra,</HI> to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that City. <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> marches to meet them; but the Battel was as imprudent|ly mannag'd by him, as fortunately fought by his Brothers. For <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> con|fiding too much in the principal Officers of his Army, again&s;t the advice of his General, who was his chief Mini&s;ter of State, and faithful to him; thought him|&s;elf &s;ure of the Victory, by falling on before his Brothers had time to repo&s;e them|&s;elves. The fir&s;t on&s;et was very rude and bloody, where <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> full of fire and courage, fighting like a Lyon, was &s;hot with five Arrows into the body. The Victory leaning to <HI>Dara-Cha, Aureng-zeb</HI> retreated; but &s;oon turn'd head again, when he &s;aw tho&s;e Traytors advancing to his aid, who were in the Army of <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> and who had treacherou&s;ly de&s;erted him, after he had lo&s;t his be&s;t Officers and his General. With this a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> renews the fight again&s;t <HI>Dara-Cha;</HI> who &s;eeing him&s;elf betray'd, and unable to maintain the fight with the &s;mall number of men which he had left, retreats to <HI>Agra,</HI> where the King his Father was, who began to mend. The King advis'd his Son to retire to the For|tre&s;s of <HI>Dehly,</HI> and to carry the Trea&s;ure that was in <HI>Agra</HI> with him; which he did without delay. Thus the Victory fell intirely to <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> and <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> who before the end of the Battel, being weaken'd with the lo&s;s of blood, was forc'd to retire to his Tent, to have his wounds dre&s;t. Now it was an ea&s;ie thing for <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> to gain tho&s;e Traytors, as well by rea&s;on of the va&s;t Trea|&s;ures which he had, as al&s;o for that the <HI>Indians</HI> are very incon&s;tant, and want genero&s;ity. Be&s;ides, the Commanders are generally Fugitive <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> per&s;ons of little worth, who are altogether for them that give mo&s;t. <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> who was Uncle to the&s;e four Princes who&s;e Mother was the King's Si&s;ter, went over to <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> with the greate&s;t part of the principal Commanders that had ad|her'd to <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> and <HI>Morat-Bakche,</HI> and had for&s;aken their Ma&s;ters. <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> then began to &s;ee his Error in having tru&s;ted <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> who &s;eeing him|&s;elf favour'd by Fortune, lo&s;t no time to accompli&s;h his ends. Thereupon <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> &s;ends to his Brother for the half of the Trea&s;ure that he had &s;eiz'd, that he might retire to <HI>Guzerat.</HI> But <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> for an&s;wer a&s;&s;ur'd him, that he had no other de&s;ign than to advance him to the Throne&punc; to which purpo&s;e he de&s;ir'd to confer with him by word of Mouth. <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> in order to that, finding him&s;elf indifferently well recover'd of his wounds, goes to vi&s;it his Brother, who kindly welcom'd him, extoll'd his courage, and told him he de&s;erv'd the be&s;t Empire of the world. The young Prince was charm'd by the melody of &s;uch &s;weet language, while his Eunuch, <HI>Shabas-Kan,</HI> did all he could to make him &s;en|&s;ible of the &s;nares that were laid for him. But when <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> &s;hould have taken the Eunuchs advice, it was too late; for <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> had already laid his plot to de&s;troy him. He invites <HI>Morat-Bakche</HI> to a Fea&s;t; and the more the one excu&s;es him&s;elf, the more the other pre&s;&s;es him to come. The young Prince per|ceiving he would take no denial, re&s;olv'd to go, for fear of di&s;covering the mi|&s;tru&s;t he had, although he verily believ'd that that day would be the la&s;t of his life, and that &s;ome deadly poy&s;on was brew'd for him. However, he was deceiv'd in that particular, for <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> not aiming at his life then, contented him&s;elf only to deprive him of his liberty, and &s;o in&s;tead of advancing him to the Throne, &s;ent him away, to be &s;afely kept in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gavaleor.</HI></P>

<P><HI>GEhan-guir,</HI> King of <HI>India,</HI> Son of <HI>Achbar,</HI> and Grandchild to <HI>Houmajon,</HI> reign'd very peaceably during the &s;pace of twenty-three years, equally belov'd both by his Subjects and Neighbours. But his life &s;eem'd too long to his two Sons, who were both ambitious to reign. The elde&s;t rais'd a power|ful Army near <HI>Lahor,</HI> with an intention to have &s;urpriz'd his Father, and to have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the Throne by force. The King incens'd at the in&s;o|lence of his Son, re&s;olv'd to cha&s;ti&s;e him; meets him with a con&s;iderable Army, defeats him, and takes him Pri&s;oner, with many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable No|bility that adher'd to him. After which, out of a natural affection to his Chil|dren, he &s;av'd his life, but put out his Eyes. And when he was blind he al|ways kept him about his per&s;on, with an intention to have prefer'd his elde&s;t Son <HI>Boulaki</HI> to the Crown, who&s;e Father had already many Sons, but all very young. But <HI>Sultan Courom,</HI> his &s;econd Son, believing it his right to be prefer'd before a Nephew, re&s;olv'd to leave no &s;tone unturn'd to remove him from his hopes, and to &s;ettle him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the death of his Father. However he conceal'd his intentions from him, appearing outwardly very obedient to his Father, who always kept about him the Children of his elde&s;t Son. By that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he more ea&s;ily brought about his de&s;igns; for having by that means gain'd the good will of his Father, he obtain'd leave to carry along with him the blind Prince, his elde&s;t Brother&punc; to his Government of the Kingdom <HI>Decan.</HI> He laid before his Father, that it would be far better to remove from his &s;ight, an object that could not chu&s;e but be &s;o afflicting to him; and that the prince him&s;elf, being blind, would &s;pend the re&s;t of his days more comfortably in <HI>Decan,</HI> where he might be more retir'd. The King not penetrating into his de&s;ign, readily con&s;ented to his reque&s;t. Who when he had that Poor Prince in his Clutches, made him away with that &s;ecre&s;ie which was not to be di&s;co|ver'd; and under the mo&s;t plau&s;ible pretence imaginable, to conceal him from the eyes of men.</P>
<P>After the death of the blind Prince, <HI>Sultan Courom</HI> took upon him the name of <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> that is, King of the World; and to uphold his Title, he rais'd an Army to fini&s;h what his Brother had begun, which was to dethrone his Father, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire. The King incens'd as well at the death of his Son, as at the attempt again&s;t his own per&s;on, &s;ent a con&s;iderable Army to cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Courom</HI> for &s;o bold an Enterprize. But the rebellious Prince finding him&s;elf to weak too &s;tand his Fathers force, quitted the Kingdom of <HI>Decan,</HI> and with certain Vagabonds that follow'd him, wander'd from place to place, till he came to <HI>Bangala,</HI> where he rais'd an Army with an intention to give the King Battle. To which purpo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ganges,</HI> he marches directly toward the Kingdom of <HI>Lahor;</HI> whom the King in per&s;on met, with an Army much more numerous and &s;tronger than his. But <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> being old, and wearied with the troubles that his Sons had put him to, dy'd by the way, leaving <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> at liberty to pur&s;ue his own de&s;igns. However before he expir'd, the good King had time to recommend his Grandchild <HI>Boulaki</HI> to <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan,</HI> his Generali&s;&s;imo and prime Mini&s;ter of State, who was Protector of the Empire. He commanded al&s;o all the Officers of the Army to acknowledg him for King, as being the lawful Heir; declaring <HI>Sultan Komrom</HI> a Rebel, and incapable of the Succe&s;&s;ion. Moreover he made <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> to &s;wear in particular, that he would never &s;uffer <HI>Boulaki</HI> to be put to death, which way &s;oever affairs went; which <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> &s;ware upon his Thigh; and as religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd as to the Article of not

putting him to death; but not as to that of helping him to the Crown, which he de&s;ign'd for <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> who had married his elde&s;t Daughter, the Mother of four Princes, and two Prince&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The news of the Kings death being known at Court, caus'd a general la|mentation. And pre&s;ently all the Grandees of the Kingdom &s;et them&s;elves to execute the Kings Will and Te&s;tament, acknowledging <HI>Sultan Boulaki</HI> for Em|peror, who was very young. That Prince had two Cou&s;in-Germans, who were both of them by the Kings con&s;ent turn'd Chri&s;tians, and made publick pro|fe&s;&s;ion thereof. Tho&s;e two young Princes, being very apprehen&s;ive, perceiv'd that <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan,</HI> Father-in-Law to <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> and Father of <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> had no good intentions toward the young King, and gave him notice of it; which co&s;t them their lives, and the King the lo&s;s of his Dominions. For the young King, having no more wit than was agreeable to his age, openly declar'd to <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> what his Cou&s;ins had reveal'd to him in private, and ask'd the Ge|neral whether it were true, that he had a de&s;ign to &s;et up his Uncle again&s;t him or no. <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> immediately accus'd the Reporters of fal&s;ity and im|pudence, and prote&s;ted his fidelity to his King, and vow'd, to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of his blood to pre&s;erve him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire. However &s;eeing his Con&s;piracy di&s;cover'd, he re&s;olv'd to prevent the puni&s;hment; to which end having got the two Princes into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he put them both to death. But before that, in regard of his power in the Army and in the Empire, he had already brought over to <HI>Cha-jehans</HI> party the greate&s;t part of the Command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs and Lords of the Court; and the better to play his game&punc; and deceive the young King, he rais'd a report that <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> was dead; and becau&s;e he had de&s;ir'd to be buried near his Father <HI>Gehan-guir,</HI> the body was to be brought to <HI>Agra.</HI> This Stratagem being cunningly manag'd, <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> him&s;elf gave advice of the feign'd death to the King; telling the King withall, that it would be but a common civility for him to go and meet the Corps when it came within a League or two of the City, being an Honour due to a Prince of the Blood of the <HI>Moguls.</HI> All this while <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> kept him&s;elf <HI>in|cognito,</HI> till coming within &s;ight of the Army that lay about <HI>Agra,</HI> he caus'd him&s;elf to be put into a Coffin, wherein there was only a hole left for him to breath at. This Coffin being carri'd under a moving Tent, all the principal Officers who were of the plot with <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan,</HI> came to perform the u&s;ual Ceremonies of State to the Body of the deceas'd Prince, while the young King was upon the way to meet the body. But then <HI>A&s;ouf-Kan</HI> finding it &s;ea&s;onably to exe|cute his de&s;ign, caus'd the Coffin to be open'd, and <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> ri&s;ing up, and &s;hewing him&s;elf to the eyes of all the Army, was &s;aluted Emperor by all the Generals and other principal&punc; Officers, who had their Cue ready; &s;o that the name of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> running in a moment from one mans mouth to another, the Acclamation became publick, and the Empire was &s;etled upon him. The young King hearing the news by the way, was &s;o &s;urpriz'd, that he thought of no|thing but how to &s;ave him&s;elf by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">light, being upon a &s;udden for&s;aken by all his followers. And <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> not believing it any way nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue him, &s;uffer'd him to wander a long time in <HI>India</HI> like a <HI>Fakir.</HI> At length he retir'd into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where he was magnificently receiv'd by <HI>Cha-Sefi,</HI> who allow'd him a pen&s;ion fit for &s;o great a Prince, which he &s;till enjoys.</P>
<P><HI>Cha-jehan</HI> having thus u&s;urp'd the Crown, the better to &s;ecure him&s;elf, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;tifle all Factions that might ari&s;e during the life of the lawful Prince, whom he had &s;o unju&s;tly de&s;poil'd of his right, by degrees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to death all tho&s;e that had &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w'n any kindne&s;s to his Nephew.

For as he had unju&s;tly depriv'd the lawful Heir, of the Empire which belong'd to him; he was him&s;elf, while he yet liv'd, depriv'd of his Crown by <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> his own Son, who kept him Pri&s;oner in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra.</HI></P>

As for <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> who had <HI>Morat Bakche</HI> &s;afe enough, he enters <HI>Agra,</HI> feigning to believe a report that <HI>Chajehan</HI> was dead, that he might have liberty to get into the Fortre&s;s, where he &s;aid one of the <HI>Omra's</HI> would make it out. The more he reported the death of <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> the more did the King endeavour to let the people know he was alive. But finding both Power and Fortune had taken <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s party; and being al&s;o in great nece&s;&s;ity for want of water, he &s;ent <HI>Fazel-Kan,</HI> grand Ma&s;ter of his Hou&s;hold, to a&s;&s;ure his Son that he was alive; and withal to tell him that it was the King's command, that he &s;hould retire to his vice-Roy-&s;hip in <HI>Decan,</HI> without putting him to any more vexation, and that upon his obedience, he would forgive whatever had pa&s;t. <HI>Aurengzeb,</HI> firm in his re&s;olution, return'd for an&s;wer to <HI>Fazel-Kan,</HI> that he was certain that the King, his Father was dead, and that upon that account he had only taken Arms to &s;e|cure the Crown to him&s;elf, which he thought he de&s;erv'd, as well as the re&s;t of his Brothers. That if his Father were living, he had too great a re&s;pect for him to undertake the lea&s;t enterprize that &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e him; and therefore that he might be certain he was not dead, he de&s;ir'd to &s;ee him, and to ki&s;s his feet; and having &s;o done, he would retire to his Government, and punctually obey his Commands. <HI>Fazel-Kan</HI> return'd this an&s;wer to the King, who declared that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee his Son, and &s;ent back <HI>Fazel-Kan,</HI> to tell him he &s;hould be welcome. But <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> more cunning than <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd <HI>Fazel-Kan</HI> that he would not &s;et his foot in the Ca&s;tle, till the Garri&s;on that was in it &s;hould be &s;ent away to make room for his men. For the Prince was afraid, and not without rea&s;on, if he &s;hould adventure into a Fortre&s;s where he was not ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eize his per&s;on, of which the King being apprehen&s;ive, con&s;ented to his propo&s;al, not being able to do better at that time. Thereupon the Garri&s;on which belong'd to <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> was &s;ent out of the Ca&s;tle, and another of <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s enter'd, commanded by <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the elde&s;t of his Sons, to whom he gave order to &s;ecure his Father's per&s;on. When they were thus got in, and his Father &s;afe, he delaid &s;eeing his Father from day to day, waiting (as he gave out for excu&s;e) a kind opportunity for the enterview; and pretending his A&s;trologers did not pre&s;ently think it &s;ea&s;onable, he retir'd into the Countrey, to a Hou&s;e about two or three leagues from <HI>Agra,</HI> which very much di&s;plea&s;ed the people, who waited every day for the fortunate hour, from which they expected a conclu&s;ion of their mi&s;eries by the Father and Son's di&s;cour&s;e together. But <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> who was in no great ha&s;t to &s;ee his Father, took up another re&s;olu|tion, which was to &s;eize upon all his Fathers trea&s;ure, which <HI>Dara-Sha</HI> had not time to carry away. He al&s;o &s;hut up in the &s;ame Fortre&s;s <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> his Si&s;ter, to keep the King company, by whom &s;he was entirely belov'd: and took into his own hands all the wealth &s;he had got, by her Father's liberality.</P>
<P><HI>Cha-jehan</HI> enrag'd to fee him&s;elf us'd in that manner by his own Son, made an attempt to e&s;cape, and kill'd &s;ome of the Guards that oppos'd him; which caus'd <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> more &s;trictly to confine him. In the mean time it was a won|derful thing to &s;ee that not one of the Servants of &s;o great a King &s;o much as offer'd to help him; that all his Subjects &s;hould for&s;ake him, and turn their eyes upon the ri&s;ing Sun; acknowledging only <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> for King, while they &s;eem'd to have forgotten <HI>Cha-jehan,</HI> though &s;till alive. Thus this great Monarch &s;adly ended his days in Pri&s;on, and dy'd in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra</HI> in the year 1666 the la&s;t time that I was in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>During his reign he had begun to build the City of <HI>Jehanabad,</HI> though he had not quite fini&s;h'd it, and therefore he de&s;ir'd to &s;ee it once more before he dy'd; but <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> would not give him leave, unle&s;s he would be content to go and come back by water, or el&s;e to be confin'd to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Jehanabad,</HI> as he was at <HI>Agra,</HI> which refu&s;al of his Son did &s;o torment him, that it ha&s;ten'd his end. Which as &s;oon as <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> heard of, he came to <HI>Agra,</HI> and &s;eiz'd upon all the Jewels, which he had not taken from his Father while he liv'd. <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> had al&s;o a quantity of Jewels, which he had not taken from her when he put her into the Ca&s;tle.

<P><HI>Dara-cha</HI> having notice of the <HI>Raja Roup</HI>'s trea&s;on, and &s;eeing all his friends had for&s;ook him, and were revolted to <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> quitted <HI>Lahor,</HI> and retir'd in|to the Kingdom of <HI>Scindi.</HI> Before he left the Fortre&s;s, he &s;ent all&punc; the Gold, Silver, Jewels and Wealth that was in the Fort, away by water to <HI>Baker,</HI> a Fort in the mid&s;t of the River <HI>Indus.</HI> To guard all that Wealth, he left an Eunuch, and &s;ix-thou&s;and men, with all provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for a Siege; after that he went to <HI>Scindi,</HI> where he left &s;everal great pieces of Cannon.

<P>In the mean time <HI>Dara-cha</HI> receiv'd news at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing,</HI> one of the mo&s;t potent <HI>Raja's</HI> in all <HI>India,</HI> was fall'n off from <HI>Aureng-zeb.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Raja</HI> al&s;o &s;olicits him to advance with his Army. <HI>Dara-cha</HI> confiding in his words, follow'd his Coun&s;el, and march'd to <HI>Emir,</HI> which was the place of Rende|vouz appointed. But <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> being regain'd by the per&s;wa&s;ions of <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eing,</HI> more potant than him&s;elf, to favour <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> never met according to his promi&s;e; nor did he come till the la&s;t pu&s;h; and then only with a de&s;ign to betray the poor Prince. Thus the two Brothers meeting, they came to a Battel which la&s;ted three dayes; but in the heat of all the Fight, <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> &s;hewing an apparent treachery, went over to <HI>Aureng-zeb;</HI> upon which <HI>Dara-cha</HI>'s Souldiers immediately fled. <HI>Dara-cha</HI> having thus lo&s;t all his hopes, and finding Fortune con|trary to all his expectations, fled away likewi&s;e with his Wives, &s;ome of his Chil|dren, and his mo&s;t faithful Servants, in an equipage that drew compa&s;&s;ion.

But not daring to tru&s;t him&s;elf by Sea; as he pa&s;s'd through the Countrey of the <HI>Patanes,</HI> in the way to <HI>Candahar,</HI> he was unworthily betraid by one of the Lords of the Countrey, call'd <HI>Gion-Kan;</HI> who had been an Officer under the King his Father, and who having been condemn'd for his crimes by the mouth of his Father, and ready to be thrown under the Elephant's-feet, had been pardon'd at the interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dara-cha.</HI> For an addition to his affliction, before he came to <HI>Gion-Kan's</HI> Hou&s;e, he receiv'd the news of the death of that particular Wife which he lov'd mo&s;t entirely, and which had always accompani'd him in his misfortunes. He under&s;tood that &s;he dy'd through heat and drowth, not being able to get a drop of water in the Countrey to refre&s;h her thir&s;t. The Prince was &s;o mov'd at the news, that he fell down, like one that had been &s;truck quite dead; and when he came to him&s;elf, he tore his clothes in the ex|ce&s;s of his grief: an ancient cu&s;tom &s;till continu'd in the Ea&s;t. He had always &s;hew'd him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible upon all other occa&s;ions of misfortune, but this fatal &s;troke &s;o deeply pierc'd him, that he would receive no con&s;olation from his friends. After this, he clad him&s;elf according to his misfortune; and in&s;tead of a Turbant, he only put about his head a piece of coar&s;e Calicut. In this mi&s;erable equipage he enter'd into the Hou&s;e of the Traytor <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> where being laid down to re&s;t him&s;elf upon a Field-bed, a new &s;ubject of &s;orrow awak'd him. For <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> having a de&s;ign to &s;eize <HI>Sepper-Shekour, Dara-cha</HI>'s &s;econd Son, the young Prince, though but a Youth, made a bold re&s;i&s;tance, and with his Bow and Arrows laid three men upon the ground; but not being able to re&s;i&s;t a multitude, he was at length taken. <HI>Dara-cha</HI> waken'd with the noi&s;e, &s;aw before his eyes his Son, whom they were leading toward him, with his hands ty'd behind him. Then the mi&s;erable Father of the young Prince, no longer misdoubting the horrid trea&s;on of <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> could not refrain from letting fall in his pa&s;&s;ion tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions. <HI>Fini&s;h,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ingrateful and infamous Villain as thou art, fini&s;h the work thou hast begun; we are become Victims to bad fortune, and</HI> Aureng-zeb<HI>'s unju&s;t Ambition. But remember that I only de&s;erve death for having &s;av'd thy life: for never Prince of the Royal Blood had his hands ty'd behind him before. Gion-Kan</HI> in &s;ome mea|&s;ure mov'd at the&s;e words, caus'd the little Prince to be unbound, and only &s;et guards upon <HI>Dara-cha</HI> and his Son. At the &s;ame time he al&s;o &s;ent expre&s;&s;es to <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eing,</HI> and to <HI>Abdulla-Kan,</HI> to give them advice that he had &s;eiz'd up|on <HI>Dara-cha</HI> and his Train. Thereupon they made ha&s;t to &s;hare in the &s;poils of that poor Prince. But they could not be &s;o &s;wift, but that <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> had &s;eiz'd upon all that <HI>Dara-cha</HI> had of mo&s;t precious in the World; u&s;ing as inhumanly both his Wives and his Children. The <HI>Raja</HI> and <HI>Abdulla</HI> being ar|riv'd, provided Elephants for the Prince, his Son, and his Wives, and carri'd them away immediately to <HI>Jehanabat;</HI> the people crowded to behold them, every one being de&s;irous to &s;ee the Prince whom they &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to have had for their King. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> caus'd them to be &s;hewn in all the Streets and Market-places of <HI>Jehanabat,</HI> that no man might que&s;tion hereafter their being taken; and as if he had glori'd in his treachery toward his Brother, he pre&s;ently condemn'd and &s;ent him away to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>A&s;&s;er.</HI> But of all that crowded to behold, not one would &s;tir to a&s;&s;i&s;t or &s;uccour their lawful Prince. Only &s;ome few generous Souldiers who had &s;erv'd him, and had receiv'd &s;ome kindne&s;&s;es from him, &s;eeing them&s;elves not able to deliver their Prince, yet de&s;irous to &s;hew him &s;ome proofs of their acknowledgment, fell with all their fury upon the Traitor <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> who though he were re&s;cu'd from them at that time, yet &s;oon after met with the re|ward due to his crime; for he was kill'd as he was cro&s;&s;ing a Wood in his return home.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> like a good Polititian, and an extraordinary Di&s;|&s;embler, gave it out, that it was by no order of his that <HI>Dara-cha</HI> was &s;eiz'd; on|ly he de&s;ir'd him to retire out of the Kingdom, which he refu&s;ing to do, <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> unknown to him, had unworthily &s;eiz'd his per&s;on; and without re&s;pect to the Royal-Blood, had &s;hamefully ty'd the hands of the young <HI>Sepper-Shekour</HI> behind him: which being a crime and an indignity done to his Maje&s;ty, had been puni&s;h'd by the death of <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> and his accomplices. But this was only publi&s;h'd to abu&s;e the people; for had it been true, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> would never have given order to have his brother's head cut off.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> caus'd him&s;elf to be declar'd King; and of the Flight of <HI>Sultan-Sujah.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS it is the cu&s;tom at the performance of that Ceremony, for the new King to &s;eat him&s;elf upon the Throne; there was not much time requir'd to prepare one, in regard that <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> before his Impri&s;onment had fini&s;h'd that which the Great <HI>Tamerlane</HI> had begun; which was the riche&s;t and mo&s;t magni|ficent that ever was &s;een. But as the Grand <HI>Cadi</HI> of the Empire, and Chief of the Law was to Proclaim the new King, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> found him&s;elf oppos'd by him. For the <HI>Cadi</HI> told him, that the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and the Law of Na|ture equally forbad him to declare him King, while his Father liv'd; be&s;ides, that he had put his elder Brother to death, to whom the Empire belong'd af|ter the death of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> their Father. This &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Cadi</HI> did not a little perplex <HI>Aureng-zeb;</HI> and therefore that he might not &s;eem to ap|pear irreligious, he call'd all the Doctors of the Law together, to whom he repre&s;ented the incapacity of his Father to govern, through Age and many infir|mities, that troubled him; as for <HI>Dara-Cha</HI> his Brother, he had put him to death becau&s;e he was a &s;lighter of the Law, drank Wine, and favour'd Infidels. Tho&s;e rea&s;ons, intermix'd with threats, caus'd his Council of Con&s;cience to conclude, that he de&s;erv'd the Empire, and ought to be proclaim'd King; though the <HI>Cadi</HI> ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t re&s;olution. There was no other Remedy therefore, but to remove him from his Employment, as a di&s;turber of the publick Peace, and to chu&s;e another for the Honour of the Law, and the Good of the Kingdom. The per&s;on who was elected by the Council was &s;oon con|firm'd by <HI>Aureng-zeb;</HI> in acknowledgment whereof, he proclaim'd him King the twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> 1660. This Proclamation being made in the <HI>Mo&s;quee, Aureng-zeb</HI> &s;eated him&s;elf upon the Throne, and receiv'd the Homages of all the Grandees of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> did not think his throne fa&s;t enough, nor him&s;elf &s;e|cure in the Empire, &s;o long as <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was rai&s;ing a powerful Army in <HI>Bengala</HI> to relea&s;e his Father. Thereupon he &s;ent a con&s;iderable Force again&s;t him, under the Command of <HI>Sultan Mahomed</HI> his elde&s;t Son; to whom he ap|pointed for his Lieutenant the <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Captains that ever came out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into <HI>India.</HI> His great Conduct and Courage had ren|der'd him a per&s;on to be reverenc'd by all po&s;terity, had he been faithful to

the Princes whom he &s;erv'd. But fir&s;t he betray'd the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> un|der whom he advanc'd his Fortune; and next to him <HI>Cha-jehan;</HI> under who&s;e protection he ro&s;e &s;o high, that there was not a Nobleman in all <HI>India</HI> more powerful or richer than he. Otherwi&s;e he is both belov'd and fear'd by the Soldiers, and perfectly under&s;tands the Art of War, according to the cu&s;tom of the Country. The two Armies engaging &s;everal times, the Victory &s;ome|times on the one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on the other; &s;o that <HI>Sultan Mahomed</HI> finding it likely to be a tedious War, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Coun&s;els of his Lieute|nant, re&s;olv'd to add policy to &s;trength. Thereupon he treats underhand with the Officers of his Uncle's Army, makes them magnificent promi&s;es, and &s;o ear|ne&s;tly &s;olicites them to come over to <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s party, whom he call'd the Pillar and Protector of <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Law, that he gain'd the principal, to whom he &s;ent con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents, to confirm them in their re&s;olutions. This was a mortal blow to <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> again&s;t which he could not provide. For they that adhear'd to him being a mercenary generation, that &s;erves whoever gives mo&s;t, finding they had little more to expect from a Prince who&s;e Exchequer was empty, re&s;olv'd to drive a Trade with <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of all the Trea&s;ure in the Kingdom. And thus did <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> debauch the Army of his Brother, who in the la&s;t Battel, &s;eeing him&s;elf abondon'd by all his Soldiers, was forc'd to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight, with his Wives and Children. The Tray|tors a&s;ham'd of their treachery, did not &s;o &s;martly pur&s;ue the unfortunate Prince as they might have done, but pre&s;ently fell to plund'ring his Tents and Bag|gage; which <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> &s;uffer'd them to do, in recompence of their Trea|&s;on. <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> in the mean time cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ganges</HI> with his Retinue, re|tir'd &s;ome time afterwards into the Kingdom of <HI>Arakan,</HI> upon the Confines of <HI>Bengala,</HI> where we &s;hall leave him for a time.</P>

<P>THough <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> were e&s;teem'd a very great Politician, and were &s;o in|deed, yet he fail'd in his Politicks, to tru&s;t his Son with &s;uch a power|ful Army, under the Conduct of a Captain who had already betray'd two Ma&s;ters. However at length he began to be jealous, le&s;t Heaven &s;hould in&s;pire his own Son to revenge the crimes which he had committed. And upon this, receiving intelligence, that <HI>Sultan Mahomed</HI> began to be very pen&s;ive and melancholy, he then ab&s;olutely believ'd that his Son was practi&s;ing mi&s;chief again&s;t him; for the better di&s;covery whereof, he wrote to <HI>Emir-Jemla.</HI> But the Letter un|happily mi&s;carrying, was taken by <HI>Sultan Mahomed</HI>'s Guards, and giv'n to the young Prince; who being a per&s;on of a quick apprehen&s;ion, conceal'd the bu|&s;ine&s;s from <HI>Emir-Jemla;</HI> and fearing le&s;t he &s;hould receive other Orders more preci&s;e to take away his life, he re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s the <HI>Ganges</HI> and throw him&s;elf upon his Uncle <HI>Sultan-Sujah;</HI> from whom he expected more mercy than from his Father. With this re&s;olution he feign'd to go a fi&s;hing, and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ganges,</HI> with &s;everal Officers that adher'd to him, he went directly to <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI>'s Camp, which lay on the other &s;ide of the River; the <HI>Sultan</HI> having rais'd a con&s;iderable Force in the Kingdom of <HI>Arakan. Sultan Mohamed</HI> coming into his Uncles pre&s;ence, threw him&s;elf at his feet, begging his pardon for having taken Arms again&s;t him, as being forc'd thereto by his Father. Now though <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had rea&s;on enough to believe, that <HI>Mahomed</HI>'s coming into his Camp, was only a trick of his Father, to &s;end his Son as a Spy to di&s;cover his condition; yet being a vertuous and generous Prince, and &s;eeing his Nephew pro&s;trate at his feet, he could not but rai&s;e him up; after which, embracing him, he a&s;&s;ur'd him of his Protection again&s;t <HI>Aureng-zeb.</HI> Some days after, the&s;e

two Princes made an attempt, and pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Ganges,</HI> and fetching a compa&s;s thought to have &s;urpriz'd the Enemies Army, who dreamt not of their coming. They made a vigorous on&s;et, and kill'd a great number of men. But when they found the whole Army had taken the Alarum, they contented them&s;elves with the mi&s;chief they had done, and repa&s;s'd&punc; the <HI>Ganges,</HI> for fear of being &s;urrounded by number.</P>
<P><HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> had already given intelligence to <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> of the Flight of his Son; which &s;en&s;ibly griev'd the Father, though he dur&s;t not &s;hew his anger, for fear of incen&s;ing the <HI>Emir</HI> to betray him, as he had betray'd his Father. Thereupon he cunningly wrote to him, that he rely'd altogether upon his pru|dence and policy to retrieve his Son to his duty; that he was young, and that what he had done, was only out of his heat of youth, and the incon&s;tancy inci|dent to his years. The confidence which <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> &s;eem'd to put in <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> incited the General to u&s;e all his endeavours to get <HI>Mahomed</HI> out of <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI>'s hands. Thereupon he gave the young Prince to under&s;tand his Fathers good intentions toward him, and that he was ready to receive him with open Arms, &s;o that he would but make good u&s;e of his Re&s;idence with <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> which he might pretend was done for the advantage to his Father, and for which his Father would have rather cau&s;e to extol his Prudence and affection than otherwi&s;e. The young Prince ea&s;ily &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be per&s;waded, and the &s;ame way he went to his Uncle's, the &s;ame way he return'd to his Fathers Camp; where <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> receiv'd him honourably, and with all the demon|&s;trations of joy. He advis'd him al&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o tell his Father when he &s;aw him, that he did not go over to <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> but only with a de&s;ign to ob&s;erve what Forces he had, and the Di&s;cipline of his Army; and that he intended to have &s;peedily return'd, and to have given him an account of what he had done for his &s;ervice. Pre&s;ently Orders came from <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> that his Son &s;hould be &s;ent to him; &s;o that <HI>Mahomed,</HI> whether by con&s;traint, or willingly, &s;et for|ward for <HI>Jehanabat,</HI> attended by the Guards which <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> had appointed. The King having notice of his arrival, his Maje&s;ty order'd him a Lodging with|out the Palace, and would not permit him to ki&s;s his hands; pretending he was not well.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>Soliman Chekour,</HI> after he had been betray'd by the <HI>Raja Roup,</HI> had continu'd under the protection of <HI>Nacti-Rani</HI> in the Province of <HI>Serenaguer.</HI> This Prince, as &s;tout as he was unfortunate, was con&s;train'd to lead a Savage life among the Mountains, for fear of falling into the hands of <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> nor could he with all his Forces do him any harm in that place. Be&s;ide <HI>Nacti-Rani</HI> had a&s;&s;ur'd him with an Oath, accompany'd with all the Ceremonies that could make it &s;olemn, and invioable; that he would rather lo&s;e his Territo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">, then that <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> &s;hould do the lea&s;t violence to that protection which he afforded him. This was done upon the Banks of a River, which pa&s;&s;es through his Country, where he wa&s;h'd his body, in token of the purity of his Soul; and being thus purify'd in the Water, he made his prote&s;tations to <HI>Soli|man-Chekour,</HI> never to for&s;ake him, taking his Gods to Witne&s;s of the &s;ince|rity of his intentions. Upon this, <HI>Soliman-Chekour</HI> never took any farther care, but every day went ot diverti&s;e him&s;elf with hunting. While he gives up him&s;elf to his plea&s;ure, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> marches his Army toward the Mountains, thinking to force <HI>Nacti-Rani</HI> to &s;urrender <HI>Soliman-Chekour</HI> into his power. But the <HI>Raja</HI> with a thou&s;and men being able to defend the Avenues of his Country again&s;t a hundred thou&s;and, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> finding he could do no good, that way, has recour&s;e to policy. He undertakes at fir&s;t to treat with the <HI>Raja,</HI> but in vain, for the <HI>Raja</HI> would not violate his Oath; and his Prie&s;ts a&s;&s;ur'd him be&s;ides, that <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> &s;hould er'e long be depos'd, and that <HI>Soliman Chekour</HI> &s;hould Reign in his room.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> thus prevented, re&s;olves to make another kind of War upon him. Thereupon he forbids all commerce between his and the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Subjects; which was very prejudicial to the latter. This caus'd the people to murmur at the protection which he had given to <HI>Soliman-Chekour;</HI> and at length they publickly cry'd out, that it was to the prejudice of the Publick. Their Prie&s;ts al&s;o, thus alarm'd, began to doubt the truth of their Oracles, and to think it convenient
<PB N="119" REF="216">
to put another interpretation upon them. But the main thing was, that the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> who had betraid <HI>Dara-Cha,</HI> wrote privately to <HI>Nacti-Rani,</HI> that it was for the &s;afety of his Per&s;on and Dominions, to &s;ubmit to <HI>Aureng-zeb;</HI> and to &s;ur|render his kin&s;man up into his hands. This advice of <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> put him to a very great plunge; dreading on the one &s;ide the breach of his oath; on the other, the revolt of his people. Uncertain what cour&s;e to take, he con&s;ults the <HI>Bra|mins,</HI> who gave their opinions that it was his duty rather to pre&s;erve his People and his Laws, which would be both de&s;troid, &s;hould they fall into the hands of <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> than to keep his Faith with a Prince from whom he could never ex|pect any advantage. The&s;e con&s;ultations being kept private from <HI>Soliman Che|kour,</HI> his ruine was concluded upon, while he thought him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;ecure. There|upon <HI>Nacti-Rani,</HI> with a Salvo, as he thought, to his Honour and his Con&s;cience, return'd for an&s;wer to <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing,</HI> that he could not con&s;ent to betray the Prince; but that <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> might take his opportunity to &s;eize his per&s;on, yet pre&s;erve his reputation too: in regard that <HI>Soliman Chekour</HI> was wont to go a Hunting up|on certain Mountains in his Countrey with a &s;mall retinue, and that it would be an ea&s;y thing for him to &s;end a number of Souldiers &s;ufficient to apprehend him.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> had receiv'd this an&s;wer, he gave order to his Son to &s;ee the bu&s;ine&s;s affected as the plot was laid. So that <HI>Soliman Chekour</HI> one day going a Hunting to the u&s;ual place, was &s;napt by a &s;trong party that lay in Ambu&s;cade. The Prince pre&s;ently apprehended the trea&s;on, and defended him&s;elf with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his Attendants, who were all &s;lain; he him&s;elf &s;lew nine, but at length over-number'd, was taken and carri'd to <HI>Jehanabat.</HI> When he came into <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s pre&s;ence, the King ask'd him how he did? As well as a Pri&s;oner of yours can do, &s;aid he, who expects no better u&s;age from you, than his Father re|ceiv'd before. The King bid him not be afraid, that he had no de&s;ign to put him to death, but only to &s;ecure his per&s;on. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> after that, demanding of him what was become of all the Trea&s;ure which he had carri'd away, the Prince made an&s;wer that he had &s;pent a great part in rai&s;ing Souldiers again&s;t him to have ruin'd him, if it had been his good fortune: That a good part was in the hands of <HI>Raja Roup,</HI> who&s;e avarice and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s was &s;ufficiently known. And that <HI>Nacti-Rani</HI> had got the remainder to deliver him to his enemies, to the prejudice of his word and honour. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> was &s;urpriz'd and touch'd at the boldne&s;s of his Nephew; but ambition &s;hutting his eyes, and &s;tifling all thoughts of ju&s;tice, which the ju&s;t remorce of Con&s;cience might excite within him, he gave or|der that <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> his Son, and <HI>Soliman Chekour</HI> his Nephew &s;hould both be committed to the Fort of <HI>Goualeor</HI> to keep <HI>Morat-Bak-che</HI> company, which was done the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1661.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who was yet alive, but &s;till mi&s;erably, was the la&s;t thorn in <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s foot; and the per&s;on that drew it out for him, and rid him of his la&s;t pain, was the King of <HI>Arakan,</HI> whither the unfortunate Prince was at length forc'd to retire. Who finding all his hopes to be lo&s;t, began to think of a Pilgri|mage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and from thence to go into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and implore a Sanctuary un|der the protection of that Prince. To this purpo&s;e he thought he might obtain a Ve&s;&s;el from the King of <HI>Arakan,</HI> or the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> to carry him to <HI>Mecca:</HI> but he was ignorant that neither of tho&s;e Kings had any Ve&s;&s;els, that would live in the main Ocean. So that he was con&s;trian'd to &s;tay with the King of <HI>Arakan,</HI> an Idolater, who&s;e Daughter he de&s;ir'd in Marriage, which the King granted, and by whom he had a Son. But that which ought to have been the greate&s;t occa&s;ion of friend&s;hip between the Son-in-law and the Father-in-law, was the greate&s;t rea&s;on of their hatred and falling-out. For &s;ome Lords of the Country, who began to be jealous of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> buzz'd the King of <HI>Arakan</HI> in the ear, as if he had an intention by vertue of his Marriage, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his Throne, and to leave it to his own Son. The <HI>Pagan</HI> King ea&s;ily believ'd what they &s;aid. Nor were the&s;e &s;upitions ill-grounded; for <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> having good &s;tore of Gold and Jewels, ea&s;ily corrupted &s;everal <HI>Mahumetans</HI> that liv'd in the Kingdom of <HI>Ara|kan,</HI> and with tho&s;e and about two-hunder'd men more that had follow'd him af|ter the rout of his Army, he undertook a mo&s;t bold enterprize, which was yet a mark rather of de&s;pair than courage. He appointed a day to tho&s;e of his party
<PB N="120" REF="217">
to force the Palace, and after they had put all the Royal Family to the Sword, to proclaim him King of <HI>Arakan.</HI> But this Plot being di&s;cover'd the day it &s;hould have been executed, <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and <HI>Sultan Bangue,</HI> his Son, had no other way to &s;ave them&s;elves, but by flight into the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu.</HI> But their way lying over Mountains almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, and through thick Forre&s;ts full of Tigers and Lions, and being al&s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, their flight avail'd them little or nothing. <HI>Sultan Bangue</HI> however being behind, to keep the Pur&s;uers in play while his Fa|ther and his Family gain'd ground, &s;toutly defended him&s;elf again&s;t the fir&s;t A&s;|&s;ailants, but at length being overpower'd by number, he was taken together with his two little Brothers, his Mother and his Si&s;ters; who were all put in Pri&s;on, where they were very ill-us'd. But &s;ome time after, the King having a de&s;ire to marry the elde&s;t Si&s;ter of <HI>Sultan Bangue,</HI> they had a little more liberty allow'd them. However they enjoy'd it not long, for the young Prince being of a tur|bulent and ambitious &s;pirit, plotted new trea&s;ons again&s;t the King, which being di&s;cover'd, the King immediately caus'd the whole Family to be put to death, not &s;paring the young Prince&s;s his Wife, though &s;he were big with Child.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who was formo&s;t among tho&s;e that fled, it is more generally thought that either he was &s;lain by the Souldiers who were &s;ent to apprehend him, or that he was torn in pieces by the Tigers and Lions; of which tho&s;e For|re&s;ts are full.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the beginning of <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI>'s Reign, and the Death of <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> his Father.</HEAD>
<P>SOme days before he a&s;cended the Throne, he &s;ent to his Father to &s;end him &s;ome of his Jewels, to the end he might appear before his people with the &s;ame magnificence as his Predece&s;&s;ors had done. <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> taking this reque&s;t of his Sons for an affront put upon him in Pri&s;on, fell into &s;uch a rage that he con|tinu'd mad for &s;ome dayes, and had like to have dy'd upon it. In the exce&s;s of his vexation he call'd &s;everal times for a Morter and a Pe&s;tle, threatning to beat all his Jewels to powder before his Son &s;hould have them. But <HI>Begum-Saeheb,</HI> his elde&s;t Daughter, never for&s;ook him, throwing her &s;elf at his feet, and by vertue of that criminal power which &s;he had over him, as being both his Daughter and his Wife, kept him from u&s;ing that extremity; more out of a de&s;ign to pre&s;erve the Jewels for her &s;elf, than for her Brother, to whom &s;he had always been a mortal enemy. For this rea&s;on, when <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> a&s;cended the Throne, he had no more than one Jewel upon his Bonnet: This Bonnet cannot be call'd a Crown; and by con&s;equence neither can the Ceremony be call'd a Coronation.</P>
<P>At the time that <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne, he would not eat any wheaten-bread, nor meat, nor fi&s;h, but fed upon barley-bread, herbs and &s;weet|meats, which was a kind of Penance that he impo&s;s'd upon him&s;elf for &s;o many crimes.</P>
<P>When <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> was &s;ettled in the Empire, &s;everal Emba&s;&s;adors came to <HI>Jeha|nabat</HI> to congratulate him, on the behalf of the Kings their Ma&s;ters, as from the King of the <HI>&V;sbeck Tartars,</HI> the Seriff of <HI>Mecca,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> al&s;o &s;ent <HI>Menheir Adrican,</HI> chief of their Factory in <HI>Surat,</HI> who was kindly receiv'd, and fir&s;t di&s;patch'd.

<P>Some months before the death of <HI>Cha-jehan Aureng-zeb</HI> &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;ador into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who was magnificently receiv'd. For a month together he was nothing but fea&s;ted and care&s;s'd with all manner of diverti&s;ements. The day that he was

to make his Pre&s;ent from the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;ate upon his Throne in a mo&s;t magnificent habit; and having receiv'd the Emba&s;&s;ador's Pre|&s;ent, he pre&s;ently divided it in contempt among the Officers of his Hou&s;e; only keep|ing for him&s;elf a Diamond that weigh'd &s;ixty Carats. Some few days after he call'd for the Emba&s;&s;ador, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, he ask'd him if he were of the Sect of the <HI>Turks?</HI> To which the Emba&s;&s;ador returning an an&s;wer, and letting &s;ome words fall again&s;t <HI>Haly,</HI> the King ask'd him what his name was.? He reply'd that <HI>Cha|jehan</HI> had given him the Name of <HI>Baubec-kan,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord of a free heart;</HI> and had honour'd him with one of the chief employments at Court. Then th'art a Vil|lain, reply'd the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with an angry countenance, to de&s;ert thy Sovereign in his nece&s;&s;ity, having receiv'd &s;o many favours from him, and to &s;erve a Tyrant, that keeps his Father in Pri&s;on, and has ma&s;&s;acr'd all his Brothers. How dares he, pur&s;u'd the King, take upon him the arrogant Title of <HI>Alem-guir Aureng-&s;ha,</HI> or King of all the World, who never conquer'd any thing, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all he has by treachery and parricide? Ha&s;t thou been one of tho&s;e that coun&s;ell'd him to &s;hed &s;o much blood, to be the Executioner of his Brothers, and to keep his Father in Pri&s;on? Thou art not worthy to wear a Beard; and with that immediately caus'd it to be &s;hav'd off; which is the greate&s;t indignity that can be put upon a man in that Countrey. Shortly after he commanded the Emba&s;&s;ador to return home, &s;ending along with him for a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> an hunder'd and fifty beautiful Hor&s;es, with a great quantity of Gold and Silver-Carpets, Cloath of Gold, rich Sha&s;hes, and other Stuffs, to a va&s;t value. When <HI>Baubec-kan</HI> was come back to <HI>Agra,</HI> where the King was then, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> incens'd at the affront which the the <HI>Sophi</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had giv'n him in the per&s;on of his Emba&s;&s;ador, lie took the Hor&s;es and &s;ent &s;ome of them into the great <HI>Piazza,</HI> others to the corners of the Streets, cau&s;ing it to be proclaim'd that the followers of <HI>Haly</HI> could not ride tho&s;e Hor&s;es without being <HI>Nigss,</HI> that is to &s;ay, unclean, as coming from a King that did not obey the true Law. After that he caus'd the Hor&s;es to be kill'd, and all the re&s;t of the Pre&s;ent to be burnt; uttering many reproachful words again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with whom he was mortally offended.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> happ'ning to dye toward the end of the year 1666. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> found him&s;elf rid of an object that every hour reproach'd his Tyran|ny; and began to injoy him&s;elf with more delight. Soon after he receiv'd his Si&s;ter <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> into favour, re&s;toring to her all her Governments, and giving her the Name of <HI>Cha-Begum,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Pince&s;s Queen. The truth is, &s;he is a Woman of Prodigious parts, and able to govern the whole Empire. And had her Father and Brothers taken her coun&s;el at the beginning of the War, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> had never been King. As for <HI>Rauchenara Begum</HI> his Si&s;ter, &s;he had always taken his &s;ide, and when &s;he heard he had taken Arms, &s;he &s;ent him all the Gold and Silver &s;he could procure. In recompence whereof he promis'd her, when he came to be King, to give her the Title of <HI>Cha-Begum,</HI> and that &s;he &s;hould &s;it up|on a Throne: in all which he was as good as his word; and they continu'd very loving together till I was la&s;t at <HI>Genanabat:</HI> but then they were not &s;o good friends, upon this occa&s;ion. The Prince&s;s having cunningly &s;toll'n into her Apart|ment a hand&s;om young fellow, could not &s;o privately let him out again after &s;he had quite tir'd him; but the King was advertiz'd thereof. Thereupon the Prin|ce&s;s to prevent the &s;hame and reproach, ran to the King in a great pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ended fright and told him that there was a man got into the <HI>Haram,</HI> even to her very Chamber, and that his intention was certainly either to have kill'd or robb'd her: that &s;uch a thing was never &s;een; that it concern'd the &s;afety of his Royal Per&s;on, and that he would do well to puni&s;h &s;everely the Eunuchs that kept guard that night. Pre&s;ently the King ran in per&s;on with a great number of Eunuchs, &s;o that the poor young man had no way to e&s;cape but by leaping out of a window into the River that runs by the Palace-walls; whereupon a world of people ran out to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eize him; the King commanding them to do him no harm, but to carry him to the Officer of Ju&s;tice: However he has not been heard of ever &s;ince that time.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Preparations again&s;t the Fea&s;t of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> when he is wheigh'd &s;olemnly every year. Of the richne&s;s of his Thrones, and the Magnificence of his Court.</HEAD>
<P>THis great Fea&s;t begins the fifth of <HI>November,</HI> and la&s;ts five days. They u&s;ually weight the King at the time of his Birth; and if he weighs more than he did the year before, there is great rejoicing. When he is weigh'd he &s;eats him&s;elf upon the riche&s;t of his Thrones; and then all the Grandees of the Kingdom come to congratulate and pre&s;ent him. The Ladies of the Court &s;end him their Pre&s;ents al&s;o, as likewi&s;e do the Governours of Provinces, and others in great Employments. The Pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;ts of Jewels, Ti&s;&s;ues, Carpetts and other Stuffs; be&s;ides Camels, Elephants, Hor&s;es, and indeed any thing that is rare and of value. 'Tis &s;aid he receives that day thirty Millions of Livres.</P>
<P>They begin to prepare for this Fea&s;t the &s;eventh of <HI>September,</HI> about two Months before it begins. The fir&s;t thing they do, is to cover the two great Courts overhead, from the middle of each Court to the Hall, which is open upon three &s;ides. The Pavilions that cover the&s;e two void places, are of Pur|ple Velvet Embroider'd with Gold, and &s;o weighty, that the Po&s;ts which &s;u&s;tain them are as big as the Ma&s;t of a Ship; &s;ome thirty, &s;ome forty foot high. There are thirty-eight of the&s;e Po&s;ts to uphold the Tent in the fir&s;t Court; and tho&s;e next the Hall, are plated with Gold as thick as a Ducket. The re&s;t are plated with Silver of the &s;ame thickne&s;s. The Cords are of Cotton of divers colours; &s;ome of them as big as a good Cable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Court is &s;urrounded with Portico's and little Chambers, where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> keep Guard&punc; For every eight days the <HI>Omrahs</HI> relieve the Guard; and during tho&s;e eight days, the <HI>Omrah</HI> who is upon the Guard, has a Di&s;h of Meat out of the Kings Kitchin. When he &s;ees it coming afar off, he makes three obey &s;ances, laying his hand three times upon the Ground, and three times upon his Head, crying out at the &s;ame time, God pre&s;erve the Kings health, give him long Life and Victory over his Enemies. They take it for a great Honour to Guard the King; and when they go upon the Guard, they put on all their mo&s;t &s;umptuous Apparel; and their Hor&s;es, Camels, and Elephants are all richly adorn'd. Some of the Camels carry a &s;mall Piece of Ordnance, with a man behind to &s;hoot it off. The meane&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Omrahs</HI> commands a thou&s;and Hor&s;e; but if he be a Prince of the Blood, he commands &s;ix thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Mogul</HI> has &s;even Thrones, &s;ome &s;et all over with Diamonds; others with Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls.</P>
<P>The large&s;t Throne, which is &s;et up in the Hall of the fir&s;t Court, is in form like one of our Field-Beds, &s;ix foot long, and four broad. The Cu&s;hion at the back is round like a Bol&s;ter; the Cu&s;hions on the &s;ides are flat.</P>
<P>I counted about a hundred and eight pale Rubies in Collets, about this Throne, the lea&s;t whereof weigh'd a hundred Carats; but there are &s;ome that weigh two hundred Emraulds I counted about a hundred and &s;ixty, that weigh'd &s;ome three&s;core, &s;ome thirty Carats.</P>
<P>The under-part, of the Canopy is all embroider'd with Pearls and Diamonds, with a Fringe of Pearls round about. Upon the top of the Canopy, which is made like an Arch with four Panes, &s;tands a Peacock, with his Tail &s;pread, con&s;i&s;ting all of Saphirs, and other proper colour'd Stones; the Body is of bea|ten Gold; enchas'd with &s;everal Jewels; and a great Ruby upon his brea&s;t, at which hangs a Pearl, that weighs fifty Carats. On each &s;ide of the Peacock &s;tand two No&s;e-gays, as high as the Bird, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;orts of Flowers, all of beaten Gold enamel'd. When the King &s;eats him&s;elf upon the Throne, there is a tran&s;parent Jewel, with a Diamond Appendant, of eighty or ninety Carats, encompa&s;s'd with Rubies and Emraulds, &s;o hung that it is always in his
<PB N="123" REF="218">
Eye. The twelve Pillars al&s;o that uphold the Canopy, are &s;et with rows of fair Pearl, round, and of an excellent Water, that weigh from &s;ix to ten Ca|rats a piece. At the di&s;tance of four feet, upon each &s;ide of the Throne, are plac'd two Para&s;ols, or Umbrello's, the handles whereof are about eight foot high, cover'd with Diamonds; the Para&s;ols them&s;elves are of crim&s;on Velvet, embroider'd and fring'd with Pearls.</P>
<P>This is the famous Throne which <HI>Tamerlane</HI> began, and <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> fini&s;h'd; which is really reported to have co&s;t a hundred and &s;ixty Millions, and five hundred-thou&s;and Livres of our Money.</P>
<P>Behind this &s;tately and magnificent Throne there is another le&s;s, in the form of a Tub, where the King bathes him&s;elf; it is an Oval, &s;even foot long, and five broad. The out&s;ide whereof &s;hines all over with Diamonds and Pearls; but there is no Canopy over it.</P>
<P>Coming into the fir&s;t Court, on the right hand, you &s;ee a particular Tent, where during all the Fea&s;t, the Morice-Dancers are appointed to make &s;port, while the King &s;its upon his Trone. On the left hand is another Tent, appointed from the Principal Officers of the Army and Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Court, while the King &s;its upon his Throne, are to be &s;een thirty Hor&s;es, fifteen upon one &s;ide, and fifteen upon the other, lead by two men. Their Bridles are very &s;hort, but for the mo&s;t part enrich'd with Diamonds, Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls, the bits whereof are of pure Gold. Every Hor&s;e wears between his Ears a rich Plume of Feathers, with a little Cu&s;hion upon his Back, ty'd on with a Surcingle, both being embroider'd with Gold; and about his Neck hung &s;ome fair Jewel, which was either a Diamond, a Ruby, or an Emrauld. The wor&s;t of tho&s;e Hor&s;es co&s;t three thou&s;and, &s;ome five thou&s;and Crowns; and &s;ome there were, that were never bought under ten thou&s;and. The young Prince, who was between &s;even and eight years old, rode upon a Hor&s;e no higher than a good big Greyhound, but very well &s;hap'd.</P>
<P>About an hour after the King has been &s;itting upon his Throne, &s;even &s;tout Ele|phants bred up for War, are brought out. One of tho&s;e Elephants has his Seat fix'd upon his back, if the King &s;hould have a mind to ride out. The others are cover'd with Cloaths richly embroider'd, with Chains of Gold and Silver about their Necks; and there are four that carry the Kings Standard upon their Crup|pers, fa&s;ten'd to a Half-Pike, which a man &s;eated on purpo&s;e clo&s;e by, holds upright with his hand. The&s;e Elephants are brought within fifty paces of the Throne, and when they come before the King, they make their obey&s;ances to him, laying their Trunks to the ground, and then lifting them up above their Heads three times; every time he makes a great cry, and then turning his back to the King, one of the Leaders turns up the Cloath, that the King may &s;ee he is in good ca&s;e. There belongs al&s;o to every one a Cord, which is put round his body, to &s;hew how much he is grown &s;ince the la&s;t year. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Elephants, which the King mo&s;t e&s;teems, is a great furious Creature, that has five hundred Roupies allow'd him every month. He is fed with good Victuals, and a great quantity of Sucre, and they give him <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> to drink. When the King rides forth upon his Elephant, the <HI>Omrahs</HI> follow on Hor&s;eback. And when he rides on Hor&s;eback, the <HI>Omrahs</HI> follow him on foot.</P>
<P>After the King has &s;een his Elephants, he ri&s;es up, and goes into his <HI>Haram</HI> through a little oval door behind the Throne.</P>
<P>The five other Thrones are &s;et up in another magnificent Hall in another Court, all cover'd over with Diamonds, without any colour'd Stone.</P>
<P>When the King has &s;taid about half an hour, he comes out again, attended by three or four Eunuchs, and &s;eats him&s;elf in the other Hall, upon the middle|mo&s;t of the five Thrones, where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> come, as long as the five days of the Fe&s;tival la&s;t, and make their Pre&s;ents to him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some other Ob&s;ervations upon the Court of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> had &s;etled him&s;elf in the Empire, which he u&s;urp'd from his Father and his Brothers, he impos'd upon him&s;elf a very &s;evere penance, eating nothing but Pul&s;e and Sweet-meats, which has made him very meagre and lean. All the time the Comet la&s;ted in the year 1665, which appear'd very great in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where I then was, <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> drank nothing but Wa|ter, and eat nothing but Bread made of Millet; which &s;o impair'd his health, that it had like to have co&s;t him his life. Be&s;ides, he always lay upon the ground, only with a Tigers Skin under him; &s;ince which time he has never been perfectly well.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him drink three &s;everal times, while he &s;at upon his Throne; to which purpo&s;e he had brought him a large Cup of Cry&s;tal of the Rock, round and all of a piece, with a Gold Cover, enrich'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and Emraulds, the foot thereof being of the &s;ame. But no per&s;ons &s;ee the King eat, only his Wives and his Eunuchs. And it is but very rarely that he goes to Dine or Sup with any of his Subjects. When I was la&s;t in <HI>India, Giafer-Kan,</HI> who was his Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> and his Uncle by marriage of his Wife, invited the King to &s;ee a new Palace which he was building, who went accordingly, and it was the greate&s;t Honour his Maje&s;ty could do him; in retaliation whereof, <HI>Giafer-Kan,</HI> and his Wife pre&s;ented him with Jewels, Elephants, Camels, Hor&s;es, and other things, to the value of a Million and fifty thou&s;and Livres of our Money. For <HI>Giafer-Kan</HI>'s Wife is the mo&s;t magnificent and liberal Woman in all <HI>India,</HI> and &s;pends more her &s;elf than all the Kings Wives and Daughters, which makes her Husband in debt, though he be almo&s;t Lord of all the Empire.</P>
<P>When the King is carried in his <HI>Palleki</HI> to the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> one of his Sons follows him, a Hor&s;eback, and all his <HI>Omrahs</HI> and officers of his Hou&s;hold come behind him a foot. Tho&s;e that are <HI>Mahumetans</HI> &s;tay for him at the top of the a&s;cent to the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> and when he is ready to come out, they march before him to the Gate of his Palace. Eight Elephants always go before the King, to every one of which belong two men; one to lead the Elephant, and the other, who &s;its upon his back, carries a Standard fix'd to a Half-Pike. The other four carry Seats or Thrones upon their backs, the one &s;quare, the other round; one cover'd, the other inclos'd with Gla&s;s of &s;everal fa&s;hions. When the King goes abroad, he has u&s;ually five or &s;ix hundred men to attend him for his Guard, arm'd every one with a kind of an Half-Pike. To the heads of their Pikes they tye two Squibs cro&s;s-wi&s;e, about a foot long, and as big as a mans Arm, which will carry the Half-Pike five hundred paces. The King is al&s;o attended by three or four hundred Mu&s;quateers; but they are very Cowards, and hardly know how to &s;hoot off their pieces. He has al&s;o a cer|tain number of Cavalry, which are Soldiers much alike. A hundred <HI>Europeans</HI> might well beat a thou&s;and <HI>Indians;</HI> but they would hardly accu&s;tom them|&s;elves to live &s;uch &s;ober lives. For as well the Hor&s;e as the Infantry will live upon Meal kneaded with Water and brown Sugar; but in the evening, when they have convenience, they make <HI>Quichery,</HI> which is Rice boil'd in Water and Salt, with a Grain, &s;o call'd. When they eat it, they &s;tir it with the ends of their Fingers in melted Butter, which is the u&s;ual food of the Sol|diers and poor people. Be&s;ide, the heat would kill our Souldiers, who would never be able to endure the Sun all the day long, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do. By the way, give me leave to tell you, that the Country people have no other cloath|ing than a piece of Linnen to hide their &s;ecret parts, being mi&s;erable poor; for if their Governours know they have any thing about them, they &s;eize it either as their right, or by force. There are &s;ome Provinces in <HI>India</HI> that lye wa&s;te, the Natives being forc'd to fly, by rea&s;on of the cruelty of their Governours. Under the pretence of being <HI>Mahumetans</HI> they per&s;ecute the poor
<PB N="125" REF="219">
Idolaters beyond all mea&s;ure; and if any one of them embrace <HI>Mahumeti&s;m,</HI> 'tis only becau&s;e they would not work any longer. For they turn Souldiers or <HI>Faquirs,</HI> who are a &s;ort of people that profe&s;s a renunciation of the World, and live upon Alms, but are indeed very Ra&s;cals. They reckon that there are in <HI>India</HI> 800000 of the&s;e <HI>Mahumetan Faquirs,</HI> and twelve hunder'd-thou&s;and Idolaters.</P>
<P>Once in fifteen days the King goes a Hunting, mounted upon his Elephant, and &s;o continues during the cha&s;e. All the Game he takes is brought within Musket|&s;hot of his Elephants. Which con&s;i&s;ts generally of Lions, Tigers, Harts, and wild-Goats. For they will not meddle with Boars, as being <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> When he returns home, he puts him&s;elf into his <HI>Palleki,</HI> and goes in the &s;ame order, and with the &s;ame Guard, as when he returns from the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> &s;aving that when he goes a Hunting, he is attended with three or four-hunder'd Hor&s;emen, that ride without any di&s;cipline in the World.</P>
<P>As for the Prince&s;&s;es, as well the Wives, Daughters and Si&s;ters of the King, they never &s;tir out of the Palace, unle&s;s it be to &s;pend a few days in the Countrey for their plea&s;ure. Some of them go abroad, but very rarely, to vi&s;it &s;ome great Noble-mens Wives, as the Wife of <HI>Giafer-Kan,</HI> who is the King's Aunt. But that is only by particular leave of the King. And then it is not the cu&s;tom as in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the Ladies make their vi&s;its only by night, and with a great number of Eunuchs, who clear the Streets of all people they meet. For in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court, they u&s;ually go out about nine in the morning, with only three or four Eunuchs, and ten or twelve Slaves, which are in&s;tead of Maids of Honour.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;&s;es are carri'd in <HI>Palleki's</HI> cover'd over with Embroider'd Tape&s;try, and a little Coach to hold one &s;ingle per&s;on that follows the <HI>Palleki,</HI> drawn by two men, the wheels not being above a foot in diameter. The rea&s;on why they carry that Coach along with them, is, becau&s;e that when the Prince&s;&s;es arrive at the Hou&s;e where they intend to alight, the men that carry the <HI>Palliki,</HI> not being permitted to go any farther than the fir&s;t Gate, they then take their Coaches, and are drawn by their female-Slaves to the Womens Apartment. I have al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that in all the Hou&s;es of great Noble-men, the Womens Apartment is at the far|ther end of all. So that you mu&s;t cro&s;s two or three great Courts, and a Garden or two, before you can come at it.</P>
<P>When the Prince&s;&s;es are married to any of the Court-Grandees, they become ab&s;olute Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of their Husbands; &s;o that if they &s;tudy not to plea&s;e them, and do not as they would have them, in regard of their free acce&s;s to the King they over-rule the King many times to their prejudice, even to the turning them out of their Employments.</P>
<P>As it is a cu&s;tom that the fir&s;t-born always is Heir to the Throne, though he be the Son of a Slave, &s;o &s;oon as the Prince&s;&s;es of the King's <HI>Haram</HI> perceive that there is any one among them big with Child, they u&s;e all the artifices imaginable to make them mi&s;carry. In&s;omuch that being at <HI>Patna</HI> in the year 1666, <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan</HI>'s Chirurgeon a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the Wife of <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan</HI> had procur'd the mi&s;carrying of eight Women, becau&s;e &s;he would &s;uffer no other Womens Children but her own.</P>

<P><HI>INdigo</HI> comes from &s;everal parts of the great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Empire; and according to the diver&s;ity of the places it differs in quality, and con&s;equently in price. In the fir&s;t place, it comes from the Territories of <HI>Biana, Indoua,</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;ae,</HI> a day or two's journey from <HI>Agra:</HI> which is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t of all.

There is al&s;o <HI>Indigo</HI> lit|tle inferior in goodne&s;s and price, which comes from the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Ter|ritories. The <HI>Mein</HI> of <HI>Surat,</HI> which contains 42 <HI>Serre's,</HI> or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu'd from 15 to 20 Roupies. They make as good as this at <HI>Baroche.</HI> That which is made up about <HI>Agra</HI> is made up in half Balls, and is the mo&s;t &s;ought for in all <HI>India.</HI> It is &s;old by the <HI>Mein,</HI> which in tho&s;e places contains 60 <HI>Serres,</HI> or 51 and three quarters of our pounds. The u&s;ual price is from 36 to 40 Rou|pies. There grows al&s;o <HI>Indico</HI> &s;ome 36 leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> about a great Village call'd <HI>Raout,</HI> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the road to <HI>Surat:</HI> of which the Natives u&s;ually make above a hunder'd-thou&s;and Roupies.</P>
<P>There comes <HI>Indigo</HI> al&s;o from <HI>Bengala,</HI> which the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company tran&s;ports for <HI>Ma&s;lipatan.</HI> But they buy this <HI>Indigo,</HI> and that of <HI>Brampour</HI> and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> cheaper by twenty four in the hunder'd, than that of <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is made of an Herb which they &s;ow every year after the rains are over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it three times a year; fir&s;t when it is about two or three foot high; and they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the fir&s;t cutting far exceeds the two latter. The &s;econd cutting is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t by ten or twelve in the hunder'd, and the third wor&s;e than the &s;econd by twelve in the hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Pa&s;te, and ob&s;erving the colour. The colour of that <HI>Indigo</HI> which is made of the fir&s;t cutting, is a violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others: and that which is made of the &s;econd is more lively than the third.</P>
<P>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it unto Pits which they make with Lime, which becomes &s;o hard, that you would judg it to be one intire piece of Marble. They are generally four&s;core or a hunder'd paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up with the Herb. Then they brui&s;e and jumble it in the water till the leaf, for the &s;talk is worth nothing, become like a kind of thick mud. This being done, they let it &s;ettle for &s;ome days; and when the &s;ettling is all at the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When the water is as drain'd out, they fill &s;everal baskets wit hthis &s;lime, and in a plain Field you &s;hall &s;ee &s;everal men at work, every one at his own ba&s;|ket, making up little pieces of <HI>Indigo</HI> flat at the bottom, at the top &s;harp like an egg. Though at <HI>Amadabat</HI> they make their pieces quite flat like a &s;mall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Merchants, becau&s;e they would not pay cu&s;tom for an unnece&s;&s;ary weight, before they tran&s;port their <HI>Indigo</HI> out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> are very careful to cau&s;e it to be &s;ifted, to &s;eperate the du&s;t from it; which they fell afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They that &s;ift this <HI>Indigo</HI> mu&s;t be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath be|fore their faces, andthat their no&s;trils be well-&s;topt, leaving only two littles holes for their eyes. Be&s;ides, they mu&s;t every half hour be &s;ure to drink milk, which is a great pre&s;ervative again&s;t the piercing quality of the du&s;t. Yet notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="129" REF="221">
all this caution, they that have &s;ifted <HI>Indigo</HI> for nine or ten days, &s;hall &s;pit nothing but blew for a good while together. Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the &s;ifters, and when I came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</P>
<P>As they take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes they lay them in the Sun to dry. Which is the rea&s;on that when the Merchants buy <HI>Indigo,</HI> they burn &s;ome pieces of it, to try whether there be any du&s;t among it. For the Natives who take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps, lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Pa&s;te, and fouls it. But when the Merchants burn it, the <HI>Indigo</HI> turns to A&s;hes, and the Sand remains.

<P>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves and Cinna|mon, are all the different &s;orts of Spices known to us. I put Cardamom, and Ginger in the fir&s;t place becau&s;e that Cardamom grows in the Territories of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and Ginger in the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other Forreign parts to <HI>Surat,</HI> which is the grand Mart.</P>
<P>Cardamom is the mo&s;t excellent of all other Spices, but it is very &s;carce; and in regard there is no great &s;tore in the place where it grows, it is only made u&s;e of in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> at the Tables of great Princes. Five hundred pound of Cardamoms, are priz'd from a hundred to a hundred and ten Reals.</P>
<P>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where there grows more than in any other part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and it is hardly to be imagin'd how much there is tran&s;ported candied into Foreign parts.</P>
<P>Pepper is of two &s;orts. There is a &s;ort which is very &s;mall, another &s;ort much bigger; both which &s;orts are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into &s;mall and great Pepper. The larger &s;ort comes from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavare;</HI> and <HI>Tuticorin</HI> and <HI>Calicut</HI> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> being vended at <HI>Rejapour,</HI> a little City in that Kingdom. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that purcha&s;e it of the <HI>Malavares,</HI> do not give Money for it, but &s;everal &s;orts of Commodities in Exchange; as Cotton, Opium, Vermillion, and Quick&s;ilver; and this is the Pepper which is brought into <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> As for the little Pepper that comes from <HI>Bantam, Afchen,</HI> and &s;ome other parts toward the Ea&s;t, there is none of it carried out of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where it is '&s;pent in va&s;t quantities, e&s;pecially among the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> For there are double the Grains of &s;mall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; be&s;ides that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</P>
<P>The little Pepper that comes to <HI>Surat,</HI> has been &s;old &s;ome years for thir|teen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and &s;o much I have &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> give for it, to tran&s;port it to <HI>Ormus, Bal&s;ara;</HI> and the Red Sea. As for the great Pepper which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fetch from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavare,</HI> five hun|dred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty-eight Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they gain <HI>Cent, per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the only Spices which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in their own hands. The three fir&s;t come from the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="222">
'Tis ob&s;ervable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never planted, which has been confirm'd to me by &s;everal per&s;ons that have liv'd &s;everal years in the Countrey. They related to me, that the Nutmeg being ripe, &s;everal Birds come from the I&s;lands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be dige&s;ted. The Nutmeg then be&s;mear'd with a vi&s;cous matter, falling to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one ob&s;ervation upon the Birds of Paradi&s;e. The&s;e Birds being very greedy after Nutmegs, come in flights to gorge them&s;eves with the plea&s;ing Spice, at the &s;ea&s;on, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the &s;trength of the Nutmeg &s;o intoxi|cates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the Emets in a &s;hort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds of Paradi&s;e are &s;aid to have no Feet; which is not true however, for I have &s;een three or four that had Feet; and a <HI>French</HI> Merchant &s;ent one from <HI>Aleppo</HI> as a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Projects, you may buy Cloves at <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> without purcha&s;ing them of the <HI>Hollander;</HI> in regard the I&s;landers buy them of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains and Soldiers, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in tho&s;e places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange Rice, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;upport of life, without which they would &s;tarve, being very &s;adly provided for.</P>
<P>When the Natives of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> are thus furni&s;h'd of Cloves, they barter them in Exchange for &s;uch Commodities as are brought them; &s;ometines they give Tortoi&s;e-Shells in exchange, and Gold Du&s;t; by which the Merchant gains &s;ix or &s;even in the hundred, being better than the Money of the I&s;land, though it be Gold, by rea&s;on the King ofttimes enhances the value of it.

The I&s;land of <HI>Grena|puis</HI> is about &s;ix Leagues in compa&s;s, and ends in a &s;harp point, where there is a continual fire burning out of the Earth. The I&s;land of <HI>Damme,</HI> where there grows great &s;tore of Nutmegs, and very big, was di&s;cover'd in the year 1647, by <HI>Abel Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">man,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>The price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them &s;old to the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> at <HI>Sarat,</HI> was as follows.</P>
<P>The Mein of <HI>Surat</HI> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of our Pounds, at &s;ixteen Ounces to the Pound.</P>
<P>A Mein of Cloves was &s;old for a hundred and there Mamoudi's and a half.</P>

<P>Nutmegs for fifty-&s;ix Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>Cinnamon comes at Pre&s;ent from the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> The Tree that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They never take off but the fir&s;t and &s;econd, which is accounted the be&s;t. They never meddle with the third, for &s;hould the Knife enter that, the Tree would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they learn from their youth. The Cinna|mon Spice is much dearer to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> than people think; for the King of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd King of <HI>Candy,</HI> from the name of his principal City, being a &s;worn Enemy to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;ends his Forces with an intention to &s;urprize them, when they gather their Cinnamon; &s;o that they are forc'd to bring &s;even or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <HI>Portugals</HI> were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all con&s;um'd. When it was cold, the upper part became a Pa&s;te like white Wax; of which they made Tapers to &s;et up in their Churches, for no &s;ooner were the Tapers lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd.

<HEAD>Deceits in the White Calicuts.</HEAD>
<P>The deceits u&s;ually put upon Calicuts, are in finene&s;s length, and breadth. Every Bale may contain two hundred pieces; among which they will juggle in five or &s;ix or ten, le&s;s fine, or le&s;s white, &s;horter and narrower than accor|ding to the &s;cantling of the Bale, which cannot be found out but by examining them piece by piece. The finene&s;s is di&s;cern'd by the eye, the length and breadth by the mea&s;ure. But the <HI>Indians</HI> practi&s;e a more cunning way, which is to count the number of threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the finene&s;s of the &s;cantling. When the number fails, it is either more tran&s;|parent, more narrow, or more cour&s;e. The difference is &s;ometimes &s;o difficult to be perceiv'd, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great deal. For it is no|thing to cou&s;en a Crown or two Crowns, in a piece that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Tho&s;e that whiten the&s;e Calicuts, to &s;ave charges of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts exce&s;&s;ively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and loars the price.</P>
<P>As for their Calicuts dy'd blew or black, you mu&s;t take care that the Work|men do not knock them after they are folded, to make them look &s;leek; for many times when they come to be unfolded, you &s;hall find holes in the crea&s;es.</P>
<P>As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and printed as they come out of the Loom, the Merchant mu&s;t take care that what he be|&s;peaks be fini&s;h'd before the end of the Rains, for the thicker the Water is

<P>There is but one cheat in the quality, that is by putting three or four Skains, of a coar&s;er Commodity than that which is uppermo&s;t, into one <HI>Mein.</HI> Which in a great quantity mounts high; for there are &s;ome Cottons that are worth an hunder'd Crowns the <HI>Men.</HI> The&s;e two cheats being often us'd by the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, there is no way but to weigh your Com|modity in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Commander, and his Councel, and to examine every <HI>Mein,</HI> Skain by Skain.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Diamonds, and the Mines and Rivers where they are found; and fir&s;t of the Author's journey to the Mine of <HI>Raolconda.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Diamond is the mo&s;t precious of all Stones, and it was in that &s;ort of Commodity wherein I mo&s;t dealt. And therefore to acquire a perfect ex|perience, I went to all the Mines; and to one of the Rivers where they are found. To which purpo&s;e I travell'd to four Mines; of which I will give you a de&s;cription; and of one of the Rivers where I have al&s;o been.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Mines, where I was, is in the Territories of the King of <HI>Vi|&s;opour,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Carnatica;</HI> and the place is call'd <HI>Raolconda,</HI> five days journey from <HI>Golconda,</HI> and eight or nine from <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI> This Mine was di&s;cover'd not above two-hunder'd years ago, as I was Inform'd by tho&s;e of the Coun|trey.</P>
<P>Round about the place where the Diamonds are found, the ground is &s;andy, full of Rocks, much re&s;embling the parts near <HI>Fountain-Bleau.</HI> There are in the Rocks &s;everal veins, &s;ome half a finger, &s;ome a whole finger-wide: And the Miners make u&s;e of Irons with hooks at the end, with which they pick out the earth or Sand, which they put into tubs, and among that earth, they find the Dia|monds. But becau&s;e the&s;e veins do not run always &s;treight, but &s;ometimes down, &s;ometimes upward, the Miners are con&s;train'd to break the Rock, following always the train of the veins: When they have open'd all the veins, and taken out all the &s;and, then they wa&s;h it two or three times over to look for the Diamonds. In this Mine it is that they find the cleane&s;t Stones, and of the white&s;t water. But the mi&s;chief is, that to fetch the &s;and out of the Rock, they are forc'd to &s;trike &s;uch terrible blows with a great Iron-leaver, that they flaw the Dia|mond, and make it look like Cry&s;tal. Which is the rea&s;on there are found &s;o many &s;oft Stones in this Diamond-Mine, though they make a great &s;hew. If the Stone be clean, they only give it a turn or two upon the wheel, not caring to &s;hape it, for fear of lo&s;ing the weight. If there be any flaws, or any points, or any black or red &s;pecks in it, they cut all the Stone into Fo&s;&s;ets, to hide the de|fect. Now becau&s;e a Merchant de&s;ires rather to have a black &s;peck than a red one; 'tis but burning the Stone, and the &s;peck becomes black. This trick at length I under&s;tood &s;o well, that when I &s;aw any Stones in them that came from the Mine made into Fo&s;&s;ets, e&s;pecially very &s;mall ones, I was certain there was either &s;ome &s;peck or &s;ome flaw in the Stone.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Diamond-Cutters at this Mine, but none of them have above one Mill, which is of Steel. They never cut but one Stone at a time upon each Mill, ca&s;ting water continually upon the Mill, to find out the grain of the Stone; which being found they pour on Oil, (not &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ing for powder of Diamonds though it be very dear,) to make the Stone &s;lide the fa&s;ter; and they lay on more weight than we do. I have &s;een them lay upon one Stone an hunder'd and fifty pound of Lead. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was a great Stone, which weigh'd an hunder'd and three Carats, after it was cut; and the Mill was like ours, only the great Wheel was turn'd by four <HI>Negros.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are not of the &s;ame opinion that we are; for they do not believe that the weight gives any lu&s;ter to the Stones. If theirs be not &s;ubject to take their lu&s;ter, 'tis becau&s;e there is always a Boy that &s;tands with a thin woodden-&s;lice in his hand, and waters the Wheel continually with Oil and Powder of Diamonds. Be&s;ides, their Wheel does not go &s;o fa&s;t as ours, becau&s;e the Woodden-wheel that turns the Steel-wheel, is not above three foot in Diameter.</P>
<P>They cannot give that lively poli&s;hment to Stones, as we give to ours in <HI>Europe;</HI> and I believe the rea&s;on to be, becau&s;e their Wheel does not run &s;o flat as ours. For in regard it is of Steel, to rub it upon the Emeril, as mu&s;t be done every four and twenty hours, the Tree mu&s;t be taken off, which can never be put on
<PB N="135" REF="224">
again &s;o as to run &s;o flat as it did. Had they the invention of Iron-mills, upon which they never u&s;e Emeril, but only the File, becau&s;e their is no nece&s;&s;ity to take off the Tree to file the Mill, they might poli&s;h their Stones better than they do. I have told you they mu&s;t eithe rub the Mill with Emeril, or file it every four and twenty hours. For when the Stone has run for &s;ome time, that part of the Mill becomes as &s;mooth and bright as gla&s;s: &s;o that if you do not rough it again either with Emeril or the File, the powder will not &s;tay; whereas if the powder &s;tay, there is more work done in an hour than otherwi&s;e in two.</P>
<P>Though a Diamond be naturally very hard, having a kind of a knot, as you &s;ee in wood, the <HI>Indian</HI> Lapidaries will cut the Stone, which our <HI>European</HI> Lapidaries find great difficulty to do, and u&s;ually will not undertake to perform; which makes the <HI>Indians</HI> require &s;omething more for the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>As for the Government of the Mines, they trade very freely, and very faith|fully. They pay two <HI>per cent.</HI> to the King for all that they buy: be&s;ides that, he has al&s;o a duty from the Merchants for leave to dig. The Merchant after he has made &s;earch with the Miners, who know all the places where the Diamonds grow, choo&s;es out a place about two-hunder'd paces in compa&s;s, where they &s;et at work &s;ometimes fifty, &s;ometimes an hunder'd Miners, as they are in ha&s;t of work. And from the day that they begin to work, to the day that they end, the Merchants pay to the King two Pagods a-day; and four when they employ and hunder'd men.</P>
<P>The&s;e poor people never get above three Pagods all the year long, though they under&s;tand their bu&s;ine&s;s extremely well; &s;o that their wages being &s;o &s;mall, they make no &s;cruple, when they can hand&s;omely, to hide a Stone for their own pro|fit; and in regard they are quite naked, only for a rag about their privities, &s;ome|times they are &s;o dextrous, as to &s;wallow the Stone. The chief of the Merchants who employ the&s;e Miners &s;hew'd me one of them, that had cozen'd him of a Stone, and had put it into the corner of his eye, but he took it from the fellow &s;o &s;oon as he had di&s;cover'd the cheat. To prevent this cozenage, there are twelve or fifteen in fifty, who are engag'd to the Merchant, that he &s;hall have no injury done him, nor any thefts committed. If by accident they meet with a Stone that weighs 14 or 16 Carats, they pre&s;ently carry it to the Ma&s;ter of the work, who gives him in recompence the <HI>Sarpo,</HI> which is a piece of Calicut to make him a Bonnet, to the value of 25 Sous, together with half a Pagod in Silver, or el&s;e a whole Pagod, when he gives him neither Rice nor Sugar.</P>
<P>The Merchants that come to trade at the Mines keep their Lodgings; and every morning about ten or eleven a clock, after they have din'd, the Ma&s;ters of the Miners bring their Diamonds to &s;hew them. If the Stones are large, or that there be &s;o many as amount from two-thou&s;and to &s;ixteen-thou&s;and Crowns, they will leave them with the &s;trange Merchant &s;even or eight days, for the Merchants to con&s;ider. When the Merchants has &s;een the Stones, it becomes him to agree upon the price in a &s;hort time. Otherwi&s;e the party that owes the Stones, takes them away again, and you &s;hall never &s;ee the &s;ame Stones again, unle&s;s mix'd with others. When the bargain is concluded, the Purcha&s;er gives a Bill of Exchange upon the Banker. If you have agreed to pay him in four dayes, and make him &s;tay longer, you mu&s;t pay him down one and an half in the hunder'd for a months in|tere&s;t. Mo&s;t commonly when they know the Merchant to be &s;ufficient, they will choo&s;e to take a Bill of Exchange for <HI>Agra,</HI> for <HI>Golconda,</HI> or <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> but more e&s;pecially for <HI>Surat,</HI> as being the mo&s;t frequented Port in all <HI>India,</HI> where they may furni&s;h them&s;elves with all Commodities which they want.</P>
<P>'Tis very plea&s;ant to &s;ee the young children of the Merchants and other people of the Countrey, from the age of ten to fifteen or &s;ixteen years, who &s;eat them|&s;elves upon a Tree, that lies in the void place of the Town: Every one of them has his Diamond-weights in a little Bag hanging at one &s;ide, on the other his Pur&s;e, with five or &s;ix-hunder'd Pagods in Gold in it. There they &s;it expecting when any per&s;on will come to &s;ell them &s;ome Diamonds. If any per&s;on brings them a Stone, they put it into the hands of the elde&s;t Boy among them, who is as it were their chief; who looks upon it, and after that gives it to him that is next him; by which means it goes from hand to hand, till it return to him again, none of the re&s;t &s;peaking one word. After that he demands the price, to buy it if po&s;&s;ible;
<PB N="136" REF="225">
but if he buy it to dear, 'tis upon his own account. In the evening the Children compute what they have laid out, then they look upon their Stones, and &s;eperate them according to their water, their weight, and clearne&s;s. Then they bring them to the great Merchants, who have generally great parcels to match: and the pro|fit is divided among the children equally; only the chief among them has a fourth in the hunder'd more than the re&s;t. As young as they are, they &s;o well under&s;tand the price of Stones, that if one of them have bought any purcha&s;e, and is willing to lo&s;e one half in the hunder'd, the other &s;hall give him his Money. They &s;hall hardly bring you a parcel of Stones, above a dozen, wherein there is not &s;ome flaw or other defect.</P>
<P>When I came to the Mine, I went to wait upon the Governour, who told me I was welcome; and becau&s;e he made no que&s;tion but that I had brought Gold with me, (for they talk of nothing under Gold at the Mines,) he bid me only lay it in my Chamber, and he would undertake it &s;hould be &s;afe. Thereupon he pre|&s;ented me with four &s;ervants to watch my Gold day and night, and to follow my orders, bidding me withal fear nothing, but eat, drink, and &s;leep, and take care of my health; but withal he told me I mu&s;t be careful of not cheating the King. Thereupon I fell to buying, and found profit enough, above twenty in the hunder'd cheaper than at <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>I have one thing to ob&s;erve which is more than ordinarily curious, concerning the manner how the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as <HI>Mahumetans</HI> as Idolaters, drive their bar|gains. Every thing is done with great &s;ilence, and without any talking on either &s;ide. The buyer and the &s;eller &s;it one before another like two Taylors, and the one of the two opening his Girdle, the &s;eller takes the right-hand of the purcha|&s;er, and covers his own hand and that with his Girdle: under which, in the pre|&s;ence of many Merchants that meet together in the &s;ame Hall, the bargain is &s;e|cretly driven without the knowledg of any per&s;on. For then the purcha&s;er nor &s;eller &s;peak neither with their mouths nor eyes, but only with the hand, as thus. When the &s;eller takes the purcha&s;er by the whole hand, that &s;ignifies a thou&s;and, and as often as he &s;queezes it, he means &s;o many thou&s;and Pagods or Roupies, ac|cording to the Money in que&s;tion. If he takes but half to the knuckle of the middle-finger, that's as much as to &s;ay fifty: The &s;mall end of the finger to the fir&s;t knuckle &s;ignifies ten. When he gra&s;ps five fingers, it &s;ignifies five-hunder'd; if but one finger, one-hunder'd. This is the my&s;tery which the <HI>Indians</HI> u&s;e in driving their bargains. And many times it happens, that it the &s;ame place, where there are &s;everal people, one and the &s;ame parcel &s;hall be &s;old &s;even or eight times over, and no per&s;on know that it was &s;old in that manner every time.</P>
<P>As for the weight of the Stones, no per&s;on can be deceiv'd in them, unle&s;s he purcha&s;e them in hugger-mugger. For if they are publickly bought, there is a per&s;on on purpo&s;e paid by the King, without any benefit from particular per&s;ons, who&s;e place it is to weigh the Diamonds; and when he has &s;poken the weight, the buyer and &s;eller are &s;atisfi'd in his words, as not being a per&s;on any way ob|lig'd to favour any per&s;on.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patch'd all my bu&s;ine&s;s at the Mine, the Governour appointed me &s;ix Hor&s;e-men to convoy me through the Territories under his Government, which extends to a River that &s;eparates the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> from that of <HI>Golconda.</HI> 'Tis a very difficult thing to cro&s;s that River, it being deep, broad and rapid; be|&s;ides that, there are no Boats. But they ferry over Men, Carriages, Oxen and Coaches upon a round Ve&s;&s;el, ten or twelve foot in Diameter, made of O&s;ier|twigs, like our Flaskets; and cover'd without with Ox-hides; as I have already related. They might ea&s;ily u&s;e Boats, or make a Bridg; but the King of <HI>Gol|conda</HI> will not &s;uffer either, becau&s;e the River parts the two Kingdoms. Every evening the Ferry-men on both &s;ides are bound to carry to two Governours on each &s;ide the River, an exact account of the Per&s;ons, Carriages and Merchandizes which they ferri'd over that day.</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Golconda,</HI> I found that the per&s;on whom I had left in tru&s;t with my Chamber, was dead: but that which I ob&s;erv'd mo&s;t remarkable, was, that I found the door &s;eal'd with two Seals, one being the <HI>Cadi's</HI> or chief Ju&s;tice's, the other the <HI>Sha-Bander</HI>'s, or Provo&s;t of the Merchants. An Officer of Ju&s;tice, together with the Servants I had left behind, watch'd the Chamber night and day. This
<PB N="137" REF="225">
Officer hearing of my arrival, went and gave notice to the <HI>Cadi</HI> and <HI>Sha-Bander,</HI> who &s;ent for me. The <HI>Cadi</HI> pre&s;ently ask'd me, if the Money I had left in the Chamber where the per&s;on dy'd were mine, and how I could prove it. I told him I had no better proofs than the Letters of Exchange which I had brought to the Banker that paid it by my order to the per&s;on deceas'd; to whom I had al&s;o giv'n farther order, that if the Banker paid me in Silver, he &s;hould change the &s;um into Gold. Thereupon the Bankers were &s;ent for, who affirm|ing the payments accordingly, the <HI>Cadi</HI> &s;ent his Deputy to op'n the Chamber door; nor would he leave me, till I had counted over my Money, and had a&s;&s;ur'd him it was right. After that I return'd to the <HI>Cadi</HI> and the <HI>Sha-Bander,</HI> and &s;ignifi'd as much to them; and having paid them &s;ome Fees which they demanded. to the value of four Crowns and a half of our Money, I return'd them my thanks for their care. This I relate to &s;hew the ju&s;tice of the Country.</P>

<P>SEven days journey from <HI>Golconda</HI> Ea&s;tward there is another Diamond Mine, call'd in the language of the Country <HI>Gani,</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> tongue <HI>Coulour.</HI> It is near a great Town, by which the &s;ame River runs, which I cro&s;s'd coming from the other Mine; and a League and a half from the Town is a high Moun|tain in the form of a Half-Moon; the &s;pace between the Town an the Moun|tain is a Plain where they dig and find Diamonds. The nearer they dig to the Mountain, the larger Stones they find; but at the top they find nothing at all.</P>
<P>It is not above a hundred years &s;ince this Mine was found out by a Country|man, who digging in a piece of ground to &s;ow Millet, found therein a pointed Stone that weigh'd above twenty-five Carats; he not knowing what the Stone was, but &s;eeing it gli&s;ter, carry'd it to <HI>Golconda,</HI> where as it happen'd well for him, he met with one that traded in Diamonds. The Merchant in|forming him&s;elf of the place where the Stone was found, admir'd to &s;ee a Jewel of that bigne&s;s, not having &s;een any one before that weigh'd above ten or twelve Carats. However his report made a great noi&s;e in the Country; in&s;omuch that the Mony'd men in the Town &s;et them&s;elves to work, and cau&s;ing the ground to be &s;earch'd, they found, and &s;till do find bigger Stones, and in greater quan|tity than in any other Mine. For they found a great number of Stones from ten to forty Carats, and &s;ometimes bigger; among the re&s;t that large Stone that weigh'd nine hundred Carats, which <HI>Mirgimola</HI> pre&s;ented to <HI>Aureng-zeb.</HI></P>
<P>But though this Mine of <HI>Coulour</HI> be &s;o con&s;iderable for the quantity of great Stones which are there found, yet the mi&s;chief is, the Stones are not clean; the Waters having &s;omething of the quality of the Earth where they are found. If the Ground be mer&s;hy, the Water enclines to black; if it be red, there is a redne&s;s in the Water; in other places the Stones appear &s;omewhat greeni&s;h, in others yellowi&s;h; &s;uch a diver&s;ity of Soils there is between the Town and the Mountain. Upon the mo&s;t part of the&s;e Stones after they are cut, there appears a kind of grea&s;ie moi&s;ture, which mu&s;t be as often wip'd off.</P>
<P>As for the Water of the Stones, it is remarkable, that whereas in <HI>Europe</HI> we make u&s;e of day-light to examine the rough Stones, and to judg of their Water, and the &s;peaks that are found therein, the <HI>Indians</HI> do all that in the night-time, &s;etting up a Lamp with a large Wiek, in a hole which they make in the Wall, about a foot &s;quare; by the light whereof they judg of the Wa|ter and clearne&s;s of the Stone, which they hold between their Fingers. The Water which they call cele&s;tial is the wor&s;t of all, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern it &s;o long as the Stone is rough. The mo&s;t infallible way to find out that Wa|ter,
<PB N="138" REF="226">
is to carry the Stone under a Tree thick of Boughs, for by the verdure of that &s;hade you may ea&s;ily di&s;cern whether the Water be blewi&s;h or no.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I was at the Mine, there were above &s;ixty thou&s;and per&s;ons at work, men, woman, and children; the men being employ'd to dig, the women, and Children to carry the Earth.</P>
<P>After the Miners have pitch'd upon the place where they intend to work, they level another place clo&s;e by, of the &s;ame extent, or el&s;e a little bigger, which they enclo&s;e with a Wall about two foot high. In the bottom of that little Wall, at the di&s;tance of every two foot, they make &s;mall holes to let in the water; which they &s;top up afterwards, till they come to drain out the water again. The place being thus prepar'd, the people that are to work meet all together, men, women, and children, with the Workma&s;ter in the Company of his Friends and Relations. Then he brings along with him &s;ome little Image of the God that they adore; which being plac'd upright upon the ground, they all pro|&s;trate them&s;elves three times before it, while their Prie&s;t &s;ays a certain prayer. The prayer being ended, he marks the forehead of every one with a kind of Glue, made of Saffron and Gum, to &s;uch a compa&s;s as will hold &s;even or eight Grains of Rice, which he &s;ticks upon it; then having wa&s;h'd their bodies with water, which every one brings in his pot, they rank them&s;elves in order to eat what the Workma&s;ter prelents them, before they go to work, to encourage them both to labour and be faithful. This Fea&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of nothing el&s;e but every one his Plate of Rice, di&s;tributed by the <HI>Bramin;</HI> for an Idolater may eat any thing from the hands of one of their Prie&s;ts. The Plates are made of the Leaves of a certain Tree, not much unlike our Walnut-tree Leaves. Be&s;ides this, eve|ry one has a quarter of a pound of Butter, melted in a &s;mall Copper pot with &s;ome Sugar.</P>
<P>When their Fea&s;t is over, the men fall to digging, the women and children to carry Earth to the place prepar'd in that manner as I have already de&s;crib'd, They dig ten, twelve, and &s;ometimes fourteen foot deep; but when they come to any water they leave off. All the Earth being carry'd into the place before|mention'd, the men, women, and children with Pitchers throw the water which is in the drains upon the Earth, letting it &s;oak for two or three days, according to the hardne&s;s of it, till it come to be a kind of Batter; then they open the holes in the Wall to let out the water, and throw on more water &s;till, till all the mud be wa&s;h'd away, and nothing left but the Sand. After that they dry it in the Sun; and then they winnow the Sand in little Winnows, as we winnow our Corn. The &s;mall du&s;t flies away, the great remains, which they pour out a|gain upon the ground.</P>
<P>The Earth being thus winnow'd, they &s;pread with a kind of Rake, as thin as they po&s;&s;ibly can; then with a wooden In&s;trument, like a Paviers Rammer, about half a foot wide at the bottom, they pound the Earth from one end to the other, two or three times over. After that they winnow it again then; and &s;preading it at one end of the Van, for fear of lo&s;ing any of the Earth, they look for the Diamond.</P>
<P>Formerly they were wont to pound the Earth with Flint-&s;tones, in&s;tead of wooden Rammers; which made great flaws in the Diamonds, and is there|fore now left off.</P>
<P>Heretofore they made no &s;cruple to buy tho&s;e Diamonds that had a green out&s;ide; for being cut, they prov'd very white, and of an excellent water.</P>
<P>Since they have been more nice; for there was a Mine di&s;cover'd between <HI>Coulour</HI> and <HI>Raolconda,</HI> which the King caus'd to be &s;hut up again, by rea&s;on of &s;ome cheats that were us'd there; for they found therein that &s;ort of Stones which had this green out&s;ide, fair and tran&s;parent, and which appear'd more fair than the others; but when they came to the Mill they crumbl'd to pieces.</P>

<P>I come to the third Mine, which is the mo&s;t ancient of all, in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala.</HI> You may give it the name of <HI>Soumelpour,</HI> which is the name of the Town next to the place where the Diamonds are found; or rather <HI>Gouel,</HI> which is the name of the River in the Sand whereof they &s;eek for the Stones. The Territories through which this River runs, belong to a <HI>Raja,</HI> who was anciently tributary to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> but revolted in the time of the Wars between <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> and <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> his Father. So &s;oon as <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> came to the Empire, he &s;ent to demand his Tribute of this <HI>Raja,</HI> as well for the time pa&s;t, as to come; who finding that his Revenues were not &s;ufficient to pay him, quitted his Country, and retir'd into the Mountains with his Subjects. Upon his refu&s;al, <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> believing he would &s;tand it out, &s;ent a great Army again&s;t him, per&s;wading him&s;elf that he &s;hould find great &s;tore of Diamonds in his Country. But he found neither Diamonds, nor People, nor Victuals, the <HI>Raja</HI> having burnt all the Corn which his Subjects could not carry away; &s;o that the greate&s;t part of <HI>Sha-jehans</HI> Army peri&s;h'd for hunger. At length the <HI>Raja</HI> return'd into his Country, upon condition to pay the <HI>Mogul</HI> &s;ome &s;light Tribute.</P>

<P><HI>Soumelpour</HI> is a great Town, the Hou&s;es whereof are built of Earth, and co|ver'd only with Branches of Coco-trees. All the&s;e thirty Leagues you travel through Woods, which is a very dangerous pa&s;&s;age, as being very much pe&s;ter'd with Robbers. The <HI>Raja</HI> lives half a League from the Town, in Tents &s;et upon a fair ri&s;ing ground, at the foot whereof runs the <HI>Gouel,</HI> de&s;cending from the Southern Mountains, and falling into <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>In this River they find the Diamonds. For after the great Rains are over, which is u&s;ually in <HI>December,</HI> they &s;tay all <HI>January</HI> till the River be clear; by rea&s;on that by that time in &s;ome places it is not above two foot deep, and in &s;everal places the Sand lies above the water. About the end of <HI>January,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> there flock together out of the great Town,
<PB N="140" REF="227">
and &s;ome others adjoining, above eight thou&s;and per&s;ons, men, women and children, that are able to work. They that are skilful know by the &s;and whe|ther there be any Diamonds or no, when they find among the &s;and little Stones like to tho&s;e which we call Thunder-Stones. They begin to make &s;earch in the River from the Town of <HI>Soumelpour</HI> to the very Mountains from whence the River falls, for fifty Leagues together.</P>
<P>Where they believe there are Diamonds, they encompa&s;s the place with Stakes, Faggots, and Earth, as when they go about to make the Arch of a Bridg to drain all the water out of that place. Then they dig out all the Sand for two foot deep, which is all carried and &s;pread upon a great place for that purpo&s;e prepar'd upon the &s;ide of the River; encompa&s;s'd with a little Wall about a foot and half high. When they have fill'd this place with as much Sand as they think convenient, they throw water upon it, wa&s;h it, and &s;ift it; doing in other things as they do at the Mines which I have already de&s;|crib'd.</P>
<P>From this River come all tho&s;e fair Points which are call'd natural Points, but a great Stone is &s;eldom found here. The rea&s;on why none of the&s;e Stones have been &s;een in <HI>Europe,</HI> is becau&s;e of the Wars, that have hinder'd the people from working.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Diamond Mine which I have &s;poken of in the Province of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> which <HI>Mirgimola</HI> caus'd to be &s;et up, by rea&s;on of the yellowne&s;s of the Diamonds, and the foulne&s;s of the Stones; there is in the I&s;land of <HI>Bor|neo,</HI> the large&s;t I&s;land in the World, another River call'd <HI>Succadan,</HI> in the Sand whereof they find Diamonds as hard as any in the other Mines. The principal rea&s;on that di&s;&s;waded me from going to the I&s;land of <HI>Borneo</HI> was, becau&s;e I under&s;tood that the Queen of the I&s;land would not permit any Strangers to carry away any of tho&s;e Diamonds out of the I&s;land. Tho&s;e few that are exported, being carry'd out by &s;tealth, and privately &s;old at <HI>Batavia.</HI> I &s;ay the Queen, and not the King, becau&s;e in that I&s;land the Women have the Soveraign Command, and not the Men. For the people are &s;o curious to have a lawful Heir upon the Throne, that the Husband not being certain that the Children which he has by his Wife are his own; but the Wife being always certain that the Children which &s;he bears are hers, they rather choo&s;e to be govern'd by a Woman, to whom they give the Title of Queen; her Husband being only her Subject, and having no power but what &s;he permits him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the diver&s;ity of Weights us'd at the Diamond Mines. Of the Pieces of Gold and Silver there Currant; and the Rule which they ob&s;erve to know the Price of Diamonds.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Mine of <HI>Raolconda</HI> they weigh by Mangelins, a Mangelin being one Carat and three quarters, that is &s;even Grains.</P>
<P>At the Mine of <HI>Gani</HI> or <HI>Coulour</HI> they u&s;e the &s;ame weights.</P>
<P>At the Mine of <HI>Soumelpour</HI> in <HI>Bengala,</HI> they weigh by Rati's, and the Rati is &s;even eighths of a Carat, or three Grains and a half. They u&s;e the &s;ame Weights over all the Empire of the <HI>Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>In the Kingdoms of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> they make u&s;e of Mangelins; but a Mangelin in tho&s;e parts is not above one Carat and three eighths. The <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Goa</HI> make u&s;e of the &s;ame Weights in <HI>Goa;</HI> but a Mangelin there is not above five Grains.</P>
<P>As for the Money in u&s;e: Fir&s;t, in <HI>Bengala,</HI> in the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> before mention'd, in regard they lye enclos'd within the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> they make their payments in Roupies.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="227">
At the two Mines about <HI>Raolconda</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the payments are made in new Pagods, which the King coins in his own Name, as being inde|pendent from the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> The new Pagod is not always at the &s;ame value; for it is &s;ometimes worth three Roupies and a half, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ome|times le&s;s; being advanc'd and brought down according to the cour&s;e of Trade, and the corre&s;pondence of the Bankers with the Princes and Governors.</P>
<P>At the Mine of <HI>Colour</HI> or <HI>Gani,</HI> which belongs to the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> they make their payments in new Pagods, which are equal in value to the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI>'s. But &s;ometimes you are forc'd to give four in the hunder'd more, by rea&s;on they are better Gold, and be&s;ides, they will take no others at the Mine. The&s;e Pagods are coin'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who, whether willingly or by force, are priviledg'd by the King to coin them in their Forts: And tho&s;e of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> co&s;t one or two <HI>per cent.</HI> more than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by rea&s;on they are better Gold, and for that the Miners choo&s;e them before the other. But in re|gard the Merchants are prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd that the Miners are a rude and &s;avage &s;ort of people, and that the ways are dangerous, they &s;tay at <HI>Golconda,</HI> where the Work|ma&s;ters keep corre&s;pondence with them, and &s;end them their Jewels. There they pay in old Pagods coin'd many ages ago by &s;everal Princes that Reign'd in <HI>India</HI> before the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> got footing therein. Tho&s;e old Pagods are worth four Roupies and a half, that is to &s;ay, a Roupy more than the new: not that there is any more Gold in them, or that they weigh any more. Only the Bankers, to ob|lige the King, not to bring down the price, pay him annually a very great Sum, by rea&s;on they get very much by it. For the Merchants receive none of tho&s;e Pa|gods without a Changer to examin them, &s;ome being all defac'd, others low-metal others wanting weight: &s;o that if one of the&s;e Bankers were not pre&s;ent at the receipt, the Merchant would be a greater lo&s;er, &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes five, &s;ometimes &s;ix i'th' hunder'd: for which they al&s;o pay them one quarter in the hunder'd for their pains. When the Miners are paid, they al&s;o receive their Mo|ney in the pre&s;ence of Bankers, who tells them which is good, and which is bad; and has for that al&s;o one quarter i'th' hunder'd. In the payment of a thou&s;and or two-thou&s;and Pagods, the Banker, for his fee, puts them into a bag, and &s;eals it with his Seal; and when the Merchant pays for his Diamonds, he brings the Seller to the Banker, who finding his bag entire, a&s;&s;ures the party that all is right and good within; and &s;o there is no more trouble.</P>
<P>As for the Roupies, they take indifferently, as well the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s as the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s: by rea&s;on that tho&s;e which that King coins, are to be coin'd, by Articles, with the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s &s;tamp.</P>
<P>'Tis an idle thing to believe that vulgar error, that it is enough to carry Spices, Tobacco, Looking-gla&s;&s;es, and &s;uch trifles to truck for Diamonds at the <HI>Indian</HI>-Mines: For I can a&s;&s;ure ye, the&s;e people will not only have Gold, but Gold of the be&s;t &s;ort too.</P>
<P>As for the roads to the Mines, &s;ome fabulous modern relations have render'd them very dangerous, and fill'd them full of Lions, Tigers, and cruel People; but I found them not only free from tho&s;e wild creatures, but al&s;o the People very loving and courteous.</P>
<P>From <HI>Golconda</HI> to <HI>Raolconda,</HI> which is the principal Mine, the road is as follows: the road being mea&s;ur'd by <HI>Gos,</HI> is four <HI>French</HI>-leagues.</P>

<P>I Make no mention of Diamonds of three Carats, the price thereof being &s;uf|ficiently known.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, as to others above that weight, you mu&s;t know how much the Dia|mond weighs, and &s;ee if it be perfect; if it be a thick Stone, well-&s;quar'd, and have all its corners, if the water be white and lively, without &s;pecks and flaws. If it be a Stone cut in Facets, which we call a Ro&s;e-Diamond, you mu&s;t take no|tice whether the form be round or oval, whether it be of a fair breadth, and not of Stones clapt together; whether it be of a good water, and without &s;pecks or flaws.</P>
<P>Such a Stone weighing one Carat, is worth 150 Livres or more. Now to know how much a Stone of the &s;ame perfection, weighing 12 Carats, is worth.</P>
<P>Multiply 12 by 12, it makes 144. Then multiply 144 by 150, which is the price of a Stone of one Carat, it comes to 21600 Livres.</P>

<P>By that it is ea&s;ie to di&s;cover the difference between a perfect and an imperfect Stone. For if that Stone of 15 Carats were perfect, the &s;econd multiplication &s;hould be wrought by 150, which is the price of a perfect Stone of one Carat: and then the Diamond would come not to 10000 Livres, but to 33750 Livres, that is 23750 Livres more than an imperfect Diamond of the &s;ame weight.</P>
<P>By this rule ob&s;erve the price of two the greate&s;t Diamonds of the World for Cut-&s;tones, the one in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> belonging to the Great <HI>Mogul;</HI> the other in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany.</HI></P>
<P>The Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Diamond weighs 279 and 9 16<HI>th</HI> Carats. It is of a perfect good water, of a good &s;hape, with only a little flaw in the edg of the cutting be low, which goes round about the Stone. Without that flaw, the fir&s;t Carat were worth 160 Livres, but for that rea&s;on I reckon it not at above 150; and &s;o by the rule it comes to 11723278 Livres, 14 Sous, and three Liards. Did the Diamond weigh no more than 279 Carats, it would not be worth above 11676150 Livres, &s;o that the nine 16<HI>ths</HI> comes to 47128 Livres, 14 Sous, and three Liards.</P>
<P>The Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>'s Diamond weighs 139 Carats, clean and well|&s;hap'd, cut in facets every way: but in regard the water enclines &s;omewhat to|ward the colour of Citron, I do not value the fir&s;t Carat above 135 Livres; &s;o that by the rule the Diamond ought to be worth 2608335 Livres.</P>
<P>A Diamond by the Miners is call'd <HI>Iri,</HI> which the <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Almas.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Colour'd Stones, and the Places where they are found.</HEAD>
<P>THere are but two places in all the Ea&s;t where Colour'd-Stones are found, within the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> The fir&s;t is a Moun|tain twelve days journey, or there-abouts, from <HI>Siren,</HI> toward the North-ea&s;t; the name whereof is <HI>Capelan.</HI> In this Mine are found great quantities of Rubies and E&s;pinels, or Mothers of Rubies, yellow Topazes, blew and white Saphirs, Ja|cinths, Amethy&s;ts, and other Stones of different colours. Among the&s;e Stones which are hard, they find other Stones of various colours, that are very &s;oft, which they call <HI>Bacan</HI> in the language of the Country, but are of little or no e&s;teem.</P>
<P><HI>Siren</HI> is the name of the City where the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> re&s;ides; and <HI>Ava</HI> is the Port of his Kingdom. From <HI>Ava</HI> to <HI>Siren</HI> you go by water in great flat-bottom'd-Barks, which is a voyage of &s;ixty days. There is no going by land, by rea&s;on the Woods are full of Lions, Tigers, and Elephants. It is one of the poore&s;t Coun|treys in the World, where there is no Commodity but Rubies; the whole Re|venue whereof amounts not to above a hunder'd-thou&s;and Crowns. Among all the Stones that are there found, you &s;hall hardly &s;ee one of three or four Ca|rats
<PB N="144" REF="229">
that is ab&s;olutely clean, by rea&s;on that the King &s;trictly enjoyns his Subjects not to export them out of his Dominions; be&s;ides that, he keeps to him&s;elf all the clean Stones that are found. So that I have got very con&s;iderably in my Travels, by carrying Rubies out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Which makes me very much &s;u&s;pect the relation of <HI>Vincent le Blanc,</HI> who reports that he &s;aw in the King's Palace, Rubies as big as eggs.</P>
<P>All Rubies are &s;old by weights, which are call'd <HI>Ratis;</HI> that is, three grains and a half, or &s;even 8<HI>ths</HI> of a Carat: and the payments are made in old Pagods.</P>

<P>If a Ruby exceed &s;ix Ratis, and be a perfect Stone, there is no value to be &s;et upon it.</P>
<P>The Natives of the Country call all Colour'd-Stones Rubies, di&s;tingui&s;hing them only by the colour. Saphirs they call Blue-Rubies, Amethy&s;ts they call Violet-Rubies, Topazes Yellow-Rubies; and &s;o of other Stones.</P>
<P>The other place where Rubies are found, is a River in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> which de&s;cends from certain high Mountains in the middle of the I&s;land; which &s;wells very high when the rains fall; but when the waters are low, the people make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;earch among the Sands for Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes. All the Stones that are found in this River, are generally fairer and clearer than tho&s;e of <HI>Pegu.</HI></P>
<P>I forgot to tell you that there are &s;ome Rubies, but more Balleis-Rubies, and an abundance of Ba&s;tard-Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes found in the Mountains that run along from <HI>Pegu</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Camboya.</HI></P>
<P>Colour'd-Stones are al&s;o found in &s;ome parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hun|gary.</HI> In <HI>Hungary</HI> there is a Mine where they find certain Flints of different big|ne&s;s; &s;ome as big as eggs, &s;ome as big as a man's fift, which being broken, contain a Ruby within as hard and as clean as tho&s;e of <HI>Pegu.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Hungary</HI> there is a Mine of Opals, which Stone is no-where el&s;e to be found in the World but there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turquoi&s;e</HI> is no-where to be found but in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Where there are two Mines. The one is called the <HI>Old-Rock,</HI> three days journey from <HI>Meched,</HI> toward the North-we&s;t, near a great Town which goes by the name of <HI>Michabourg.</HI> The other which is call'd the <HI>New-Rock</HI> is five days journey off. Tho&s;e of the <HI>New-Rock</HI> are of a Paler blue enclining to white, and le&s;s e&s;teem'd, &s;o that you may have a great many for a little Money. Some years &s;ince the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> com|manded that no <HI>Turquoi&s;es</HI> &s;hould be digg'd out of the <HI>Old-Rock,</HI> but only for him|&s;elf; making u&s;e of tho&s;e <HI>Turquoi&s;es</HI> in&s;tead of enamelling, to adorn Hilts of Swords, Knives and Daggers; of which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are altogether ignorant.</P>
<P>As for Emraulds, it is a vulgar error to &s;ay they come originally from the Ea&s;t. And therefore when Jewellers and Gold-&s;miths, to prefer a deep-colour'd Em|rauld enclining to black, tell ye, it is an Oriental Emrauld, they &s;peak that which is not true. I confe&s;s I could never di&s;cover in what part of our Continent tho&s;e Stones are found. But &s;ure I am, that the Ea&s;tern-part of the World never pro|duc'd any of tho&s;e Stones, neither in the Continent, nor in the I&s;lands. True it is, that &s;ince the di&s;covery of <HI>America</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e Stones have been often brought rough from <HI>Peru</HI> to the <HI>Philippine</HI>-I&s;lands, whence they have been tran&s;ported in|to <HI>Europe;</HI> but this is not enough to make them Oriental. Be&s;ides that, at this time they &s;end them into <HI>Spain</HI> through the North-Sea.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Pearles, and the Places where they Fi&s;h for them.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, there is a Fi&s;hery for Pearls in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, round about the I&s;land of <HI>Bakren.</HI> It belongs to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and there is a &s;trong Fort in it, Garri&s;on'd with three hundred men. The Water which the people dring in that I&s;land, and all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is bracki&s;h and ill ta&s;ted, &s;o that only the Natives of the Country can drink it. Fre&s;h wa|ter co&s;ts&punc; Strangers very dear; for the people fetch it &s;ometimes on League, &s;ometimes two Leagues from the I&s;land, from the bottom of the Sea, being let down by a Rope, with a Bottle or two ty'd about their wa&s;tes, which they fill, and &s;top it well; and then giving the Rope a twitch, are hall'd up again by their Companions.</P>
<P>Every one that fi&s;hes pays to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> five <HI>Aba&s;&s;is,</HI> whether he get any thing or no. The Merchant al&s;o pays the King &s;ome &s;mall matter for every thou&s;and Oy&s;ters</P>
<P>The &s;econd Fi&s;hery for Perals is right again&s;t <HI>Bakren</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ara|bia</HI> the happy, near the City of <HI>Catifa,</HI> which together with all the Country about it, is under the Juri&s;diction of an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince. The Pearls that are fi&s;h'd in the&s;e places are &s;old to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are not &s;o nice as we; for they give a good price for all, as well the uneven as the round ones. Over all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> they chu&s;e the yellow Water enclining to white; for they &s;ay tho&s;e Pearls that encline &s;omewhat to a Gold colour, are more brisk, and never change colour; but that the white ones will change in thirty-years time, through the very heat of the weather and the &s;weat of the per&s;on that wears them, turning the &s;candalou&s;ly yellow.</P>
<P>There is a wondrous Pearl in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, that took <HI>Ma&s;cate</HI> from the <HI>Portugals.</HI> He then call'd him&s;elf <HI>Imenhect</HI> Prince of <HI>Ma&s;|cate;</HI> being known before only by the name of <HI>Aceph Ben-Ali</HI> Prince of <HI>No|rennae.</HI> It is but a &s;mall Province, but it is the be&s;t of all in the Happy <HI>Ara|bia.</HI> Therein grow all things nece&s;&s;ary for the life of man; particularly, de|licate fruits, but more e&s;pecially mo&s;t excellent Grapes, which would make mo&s;t incomparable Wine. This Prince has the mo&s;t wonderful Pearl in the world, not &s;o much for its bigne&s;s, for it weighs not above twelve Carats and one &s;ixteenth, not for its perfect roundne&s;s, but becau&s;e it is &s;o clear and &s;o tran&s;parent that you may almo&s;t &s;ee through it. The Great <HI>Mogul</HI> offer'd him by a <HI>Banian</HI> forty thou&s;and Crowns for his Pearl, but he would not accept it. By which you &s;ee, that it is more profitable to carry Jewels that are rare out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> than to bring them out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe;</HI> unle&s;s it be to <HI>Japan</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> where Jewels are little e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P>There is another Fi&s;hery for Pearles in the Sea that beats again&s;t the Walls of a great Town call'd <HI>Manar,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> For their roundne&s;s and their Water, they are the faire&s;t that are found in any other Fi&s;hery; but they rarely weigh above three or four Carats,</P>
<P>There are excellent Pearls, and of a very good water, and large, which are found upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Japan;</HI> but there are few fi&s;h'd for, in regard Jewels are of no e&s;teem among the Natives.</P>
<P>There are other Fi&s;heries, in the We&s;t <HI>Indies;</HI> in the fir&s;t place all along the I&s;land of <HI>Cubagna,</HI> three Leagues in compa&s;s, lying ten Degrees and a half of Northern Latidue, a hundred and &s;ixty Leagues from <HI>Santo Domingo.</HI> The Pearls are &s;mall, &s;eldom weighing above five Carats.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Fi&s;hery is in the I&s;land of <HI>Manguerita,</HI> or the I&s;land of Pearles, a League from <HI>Cubagna,</HI> but much bigger. This Fi&s;hery is not the mo&s;t plen|tiful, but it is the mo&s;t e&s;teem'd of all tho&s;e in the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> by rea&s;on the Pearles are of mo&s;t excellent water, and very large. I &s;old one Pear-fa&s;hion'd to <HI>Sha-Est-Kan,</HI> the Great <HI>Moguls</HI> Uncle, that weigh'd fifty-five Carats.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="230">
The third Fi&s;hery is at <HI>Camogete,</HI> near the Continent.</P>
<P>The fourth at <HI>Rio de la Hacha,</HI> all along the &s;ame Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t, at St. <HI>Martha's,</HI> &s;ixty Leagues from <HI>Rio de la Hacha.</HI> All the&s;e three Fi&s;heries produce very weighty Pearls; but they are generally ill|&s;hap'd, and of a water enclining to the colour of Lead.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Scotch</HI> Pearl, and tho&s;e that are found in the Rivers of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> tho a Neck-lace of them may be worth a thou&s;and Crowns, yet they are not to be compar'd with the Ea&s;tern and We&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Pearls.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince there was a Fi&s;hery di&s;cover'd in a certain place upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Japan,</HI> and I have &s;een &s;ome which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have brought thence. They are of a very good water, and large, but very uneven.</P>
<P>Take this ob&s;ervation along with you, touching the difference of their wa|ters; &s;ome being very white, others inclining to yellow, others to black, others to a leaden colour. As for the la&s;t, there are no &s;uch but only in <HI>America,</HI> which proceeds from the nature of the Earth at the bottom of the Water, which is generally more ouzy than in the Ea&s;t. I once met with &s;ix Pearls in the return of a Cargo from the We&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> that were perfectly round, but black like jet, which weigh'd one with another twelve Carats. I carried them into the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> to put them off, but could meet with 10 Chapman to buy them. As for tho&s;e that incline to yellow, it proceeds from hence, that the Fi&s;hermen &s;elling the Oy&s;ters to the Merchants in heaps, while they &s;tay fourteen or fif|teen days till the Oy&s;ters lo&s;e their water, the Oy&s;ters wa&s;t and begin to &s;mell, for which rea&s;on the Pearl grows yellow by infection, which appears to be a truth, in regard that where the Oy&s;ters pre&s;erve their liquor the Pearls are white. Now the rea&s;on why they &s;tay till the Oy&s;ters open of them&s;elves, is becau&s;e that if they &s;hould force them open, they might perhaps injure and cut the Pearl. In &s;hort, the Ea&s;tern people are much of our humour in matter of whitene&s;s, for they love the white&s;t Pearls and the blacke&s;t Diamonds; the white&s;t bread, and the faire&s;t women.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Pearls are bred in the Oy&s;ters; how they Fi&s;h for them, and at what time.</HEAD>
<P>SOme ancient Writers have vulgarly reported, that Pearls are produc'd by the Dew of Heaven, and that there is but one in an Oy&s;ter; but experience teaches the contrary. For the Oy&s;ter never &s;tirs from the bottom of the Sea, where the Dew can never come, which is many times twelve fathoms deep; be&s;ides, that it is as often ob&s;erv'd, that there are &s;ix or &s;even Pearls in one Oy&s;ter; and I have had in my hands an Oy&s;ter, wherein there were above ten beginning to breed. 'Tis very true, that they are not always of the &s;ame big|ne&s;s; for they grow in an Oy&s;ter after the &s;ame manner as Eggs in the Belly of a Pullet. But I cannot &s;ay there are Pearls in all, for you may open many Oy&s;ters and find none.</P>
<P>'Tis no advantage to them that fi&s;h for Pearls; for if the poor people could find any other employment, they would never &s;tick to &s;uch a one as meerly keeps them alive. But the Land is &s;o barren, that you may travel twenty Leagues be|fore you meet with one blade of Gra&s;s; and the people are &s;o mi&s;erably poor, that they feed upon nothing but Dates and Salt-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>They fi&s;h in the Ea&s;tern Seas twice a year; the fir&s;t time in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> the &s;econd time in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> and they keep their Fairs in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>November.</HI> However they do not fi&s;h every year; for they that fi&s;h, will know beforehand whether it will turn to account or no. Now to the end they may not be deceiv'd, they &s;end to the places where they are wont to fi&s;h, &s;even or eight Barks, who bring back each of them about a thou&s;and Oy&s;ters,
<PB N="147" REF="230">
which they open, and if they find not in every thou&s;and Oy&s;ters to the value of five Fano's of Pearl, which amounts to half a Crown of our Money, 'tis a &s;ign that the Fi&s;hing will not turn to account, in regard the poor people would not be able to defray their charge. For partly for a &s;tock to &s;et out, and partly for victuals while they are abroad, they are forc'd to borrow Money at three or four in the hundred a month. So that unle&s;s a thou&s;and Oy&s;ters yield them five Fano's of Pearls; they do not fi&s;h that year. As for the Merchants, they mu&s;t buy their Oy&s;ters at hap-hazard, and be content with what they find in them. If they meet with great Pearls, they account them&s;elves happy; which they &s;eldom do at the Fi&s;hery of <HI>Manar,</HI> tho&s;e Pearls being fit for little el&s;e but to be &s;old by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">unce, to powder. Sometimes a thou&s;and Oy&s;ters amounts to &s;even Fano's, and the whole Fi&s;hery to a hundred thou&s;and Pia&s;ters. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> take of every Di|ver eight Pia&s;ters, in regard they always attend the Fi&s;hery with two or three &s;mall Men of War, to defend them from the <HI>Malavares</HI> Pyrats.</P>
<P>The more Rain falls in the year, the more profitable the Fi&s;hery happens to be. They fi&s;h in twelve fathom water, five or &s;ix Leagues off at Sea, &s;ometimes two hundred and fifty Barks together, among which there is not above one or two Divers at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>There is a Cord ty'd under the Arms of them that dive, one end whereof is held by them that are in the Bark. There is al&s;o a great &s;tone of eighteen or twenty pound ty'd to the great Toe of him that dives; the end of the Rope that fa&s;tens it being al&s;o held by them in the Ve&s;&s;el. The Diver has be&s;ide a Sack made like a Net, the mouth whereof is kept open with a Hoop. Thus provided, he plunges into the Sea, the weight of the &s;tone pre&s;ently &s;inking him; when he is at the bottom, he &s;lips off the &s;tone, and the Bark puts off. Then the Diver goes to filling his Sack, as long as he can keep his breath; which when he can do no longer, he gives the Rope a twitch, and is pre&s;ently hall'd up again. Tho&s;e of <HI>Manar</HI> are better Fi&s;hers, and &s;tay longer in the water than tho&s;e of <HI>Bakren</HI> and <HI>Catifa;</HI> for they neither put Pincers upon their No&s;es, nor Cotton in their Ears, as they do in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf.</P>
<P>After the Diver is draw'n up, he &s;tays half a quarter of an hour to take breath, and then dives again, for ten or twelve hours together. As for the Oy&s;ters them&s;elves, they throw'em away, as being ill-ta&s;ted and un&s;avoury.</P>
<P>To conclude the di&s;cour&s;e of Pearls, you are to take notice, that in <HI>Europe</HI> they &s;ell them by the Carat weight, which is four Grains. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they &s;ell them by the Abas, and one Abas is an eighteenth le&s;s than our Carat. In the Dominions of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and <HI>Golconda</HI> weigh them by the Ratis, and one Ratis is al&s;o an eighteenth le&s;s than our Carat.</P>
<P><HI>Goa</HI> was formerly the greate&s;t place of the World for the trade of jewels and Pearls. You mu&s;t know therefore, that in <HI>Goa,</HI> and in all other places which the <HI>Portugals</HI> had in the <HI>Indies,</HI> they us'd a particular weight to &s;ell their Pearls by, which they call Chego's; the proportion whereof to Carats appears in the fol|lowing Table.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Coral, and Yellow Amber, and the places where it is found.</HEAD>
<P>COral, but little valu'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> is highly e&s;teem'd in all the three other parts of the World; and there are three places where they fi&s;h for it upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sardigna.</HI> That of <HI>Arguerrel</HI> is the faire&s;t of all. The &s;econd place is call'd <HI>Boza;</HI> and the third is neer the I&s;land of St. <HI>Peter.</HI> There are two other places upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> the one neer the Ba&s;tion of <HI>France;</HI> the other at <HI>Ta|barque.</HI> There is al&s;o another Fi&s;hery upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sicily,</HI> neer <HI>Trepano,</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Coral is &s;mall, and ill-colour'd. There is another upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Catalogna,</HI> neer <HI>Cape de Quiers;</HI> where the Coral is large, and of an excellent colour, but the branches are &s;hort. There is a ninth Fi&s;hery in the I&s;land of <HI>Majorque,</HI> much like that neer the I&s;land of <HI>Cor&s;ica.</HI> And the&s;e are all the places in the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea,</HI> where they fi&s;h for Coral; for there is none at all in the Ocean.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e that Coral grows under the hollow Rocks where the Sea is deep, the Fi&s;hers fix two &s;pars of wood a-cro&s;s, fa&s;tening a great piece of Lead in the mid|dle to make it &s;ink: after that they wind carele&s;ly about the &s;par good &s;tore of tufted Hemp, and fa&s;ten the wood to two Cords, one end whereof hangs at the Poop, the other at the Prow of the Ve&s;&s;el. Then letting go the wood with the &s;tream or current by the fides of the Rock, the Hemp twi&s;ts it &s;elf among the Coral, &s;o that &s;ometimes they &s;tand in need of five or &s;ix Boats to pull up the wood again: and if one of the Cables &s;hould chance to break with the &s;tre&s;s, all the Rowers are in danger to be lo&s;t. While they tear up the Coral thus by force, there tumbles as much into the Sea as they fetch up: and the bottom of the Sea being generally very ouzy, the Coral will be eaten as our fruits are eaten by the worms; &s;o that the &s;ooner they get it out of the mud, the le&s;s it will be wa|&s;ted.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of one thing that I &s;aw at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in a Shop where they dealt in Coral. It was a great piece of Coral, as big about as a man's fi&s;t, which becau&s;e it was a little worm-eaten, was cut in two pieces. When it was &s;o cut, there was a worm that &s;tirr'd, and had life, and liv'd for &s;ome months after, being again put into the hole. For among &s;ome branches of Coral there engen|ders a kind of &s;pongy-matter, like our honey-combs, where the&s;e worms lye like bees.</P>
<P>Some think that Coral is &s;oft in the Sea, though in truth it be hard. But this indeed is as true, that in certain months of the year you may &s;queze out of the end of a branch a kind of milky-&s;ub&s;tance; and this perhaps may be a kind of &s;eed, which falling upon any thing that it fir&s;t meets with in the Sea (as if it light upon a dead Skull, the blade of a Sword, or a Pomgranate) produces another branch of Coral. And I have &s;een a Pomgranate, and had it in my hand, that had fallen into the Sea, about which the Coral had twin'd at lea&s;t half a foot high.</P>
<P>They fi&s;h for Coral from the beginning of <HI>April</HI> to the end of <HI>July;</HI> to which purpo&s;e there are employ'd above 200 Ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome years more, and &s;ome years le&s;s. They are built all along the River of <HI>Genoa,</HI> being very &s;wift. Their &s;ails are very large for more &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;o that there are no Gallies can reach them. There are &s;even men and a boy to every Barque. They never fi&s;h above forty miles from the Land, where they think there are Rocks, for fear of the Pyrats, from which they make all the Sail they can when they &s;ee them, and ea&s;ily &s;cape them through the nimblene&s;s of their Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I have one ob&s;ervation to make concerning Coral, in re&s;pect of the Ea&s;tern|people. The <HI>Japponners</HI> make little account of Jewels or Pearls; valuing nothing &s;o much as a good grain of Coral, wherewith they pull the &s;tring that &s;huts their Pur&s;es, &s;uch as we had formerly in <HI>England.</HI> So that they &s;trive who &s;hall have the faire&s;t grain of Coral hanging at the end of the Silk-&s;tring that draws their Pur&s;es. For this rea&s;on a piece of Coral as big as an egg, fair and clean without any flaw, will produce what any man will ask in rea&s;on for it. The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="238">
have a&s;&s;ur'd me they would &s;ometimes give 20000 Crowns for &s;uch a piece. And no wonder they will give &s;o much Money for a piece of Coral, who de&s;pi&s;ing all other Jewels and Pearls, care for nothing but that which is in no e&s;teem any where el&s;e. They &s;et a great value upon the Skin of a certain Fi&s;h which is rougher than a Seal-skin. Upon the back of the Fi&s;h there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> little holes, and &s;ome|times eight, &s;omewhat elevated, with another in the middle; in the form of a Ro&s;e. They make Scabberds for Swords of the Skin; and the more tho&s;e holes grow in the form of a Ro&s;e, the higher value they put upon them; having giv'n ten-thou&s;and Crowns for a Skin. To conclude the di&s;cour&s;e of Coral, you mu&s;t know that the meaner &s;ort of people u&s;e it for Bracelets and Neck-laces, all over <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> e&s;pecially toward the Northern Territories of the great <HI>Mogul;</HI> and all along the Mountains as you go to the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;en</HI> and <HI>Boutan.</HI></P>
<P>Yellow-Amber is only found upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> in the <HI>Baltick-Sea,</HI> where the Sea throws it upon the Sand when &s;uch and &s;uch winds blow. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who is Sovereign of that Coa&s;t, farms it out for 20000 Crowns a year, and &s;ometimes 22000. And the Farmers keep guards on both &s;ides of the &s;hoar, in regard the Sea ca&s;ts it up &s;ometimes upon one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes upon the other, to prevent the &s;tealing of it.</P>
<P>Amber is nothing but a certain congelation made in the Sea, like a certain Gum; for you &s;hall find in &s;everal pieces, Flies, Gnats, and other in&s;ects congeal'd therein. I &s;aw &s;even or eight Flies &s;o congeal'd in one piece.</P>
<P>In <HI>China,</HI> when any great Lord makes a Fea&s;t, it is for his Grandeur and Mag|nificence to cau&s;e three or four &s;everal &s;orts of Perfuming-pots to be &s;et upon the Table, and to throw into every one of them a va&s;t quantity of Amber; for the more it burns, and the bigger the pieces are, the more magnificent is the Enter|tainment accounted. The rea&s;on of this cu&s;tom is, becau&s;e they adore the fire; and be&s;ides, that the Amber ca&s;ts forth a &s;cent plea&s;ing to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> there is a kind of Oil in it, that flames after a more unu&s;ual manner than other materials of fire. This wa&s;t of Amber makes it the be&s;t Commodity that could be imported into <HI>China,</HI> if the Trade were free for Strangers. At pre&s;ent the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have engro&s;s'd all this Trade to them&s;elves, and the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> come all to <HI>Batavia</HI> to buy it.</P>
<P>As for Amber-gri&s;e; there is no per&s;on in the World that knows either what it is, or where, or how it is produc'd. But the faire&s;t probability is, that it mu&s;t be only in the Ea&s;tern-Sea&punc; though &s;ome parcels have been found upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and in &s;ome other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The greate&s;t quantity is found upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Melinda,</HI> but more e&s;pecially in the mouth of a River call'd <HI>Rio de Sena.</HI> The Governor of <HI>Mozambique</HI> gets in the three years of his Government above 300000 Pardo's of Amber-gri&s;e, every Pardo containing 27 Sous of our Money. Sometimes they meet with very large and very con&s;iderable pieces. In the year 1627 a <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;etting Sail from <HI>Goa</HI> to the <HI>Manilles,</HI> after he had pa&s;t the Streight of <HI>Malacca,</HI> was by tempe&s;t driv'n near an unknown I&s;land, where they came to an Anchor. Several of the Ship's-Company ventring a-&s;hore, met with a River; and going to bath them&s;elves in it, one of them found a great piece of Amber-gri&s;e that weigh'd thirty-three pounds; but falling together by the ears about their &s;hares, the Captain, to reconcile them, told them 'twas pitty to deface it, in regard it was a Pre&s;ent fit for the King; and therefore advis'd them to pre&s;ent it to the Vice-Roy, who would no doubt reward them for their pains. By that means the Captain got the parcel out of their Clutches, and pre&s;enting it to the Vice-Roy, got a reward for him&s;elf; and the Party that found it: but the re&s;t had nothing at all.</P>
<P>In the year 1646 or 1647, a <HI>Middleburgher</HI> of good quality found a piece of forty-two pounds upon the Coa&s;t of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> where he com|manded for the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, Ea&s;t of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and &s;ent it to <HI>Batavia:</HI> but there being a mark, as if &s;ome piece of it were broken off, the <HI>Zelander,</HI> was accus'd to have taken half, and turn'd out of his Command, what|ever he could &s;ay to ju&s;tify him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Musk and Bezoar; and &s;ome other Medicinal Stones.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t &s;ort, and the greate&s;t quantity of Musk, comes from the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan,</HI> from whence they bring it to <HI>Patna,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Bengala,</HI> to truck it away for other Commodities. All the Musk that is &s;old in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> comes from thence. And the Musk-Merchants had rather deal with you for Coral and Yellow-Amber, than for Gold or Silver; in regard the other is more in e&s;teem among the Natives where they live. I was &s;o curious as to bring the Skin of one to <HI>Paris,</HI> of which I caus'd the figure to be cut.</P>
<P>After they have kill'd the creature, they cut off the bladder that grows under the belly as big as an egg, nearer to the genital parts than to the navil: Then they take out the Musk that is in the bladder, which at that time looks like clotted|blood. When the natives would adulterate their Musk, they &s;tuff the bladder with the liver and blood of the Animal &s;lic'd together, after they have taken out as much of the right Musk as they think convenient. This mixture in two or three years time produces certain Animals in the bladder that eat the good Musk; &s;o that when you come to open it, there is a great wa&s;t. Others, &s;o &s;oon as they have cut off the bladder, and taken out as much of the Musk, as that the deceit may not be too palpable, fill up the Ve&s;&s;el with little &s;tones to make it weight. The Merchants are le&s;s di&s;pleas'd at this deceit than the former, by rea&s;on that they do not find the Musk to be eaten. But the deceit is harder to be di&s;cover'd, when they make little Pur&s;es of the skin of the belly of the Bea&s;t, which they &s;ow up with &s;trings of the &s;ame skin, which are like the true bladders; and then fill tho&s;e Pur&s;es with what they have taken out of the right bladders, and the other fraudulent mixture which they de&s;ign to put among it. True it is, that &s;hould they tye up the bladder as &s;oon as they cut it off, without giving it air or time to lo&s;e its force, the &s;trength of the perfume would cau&s;e the blood to gu&s;h out of the no&s;e, &s;o that it mu&s;t be qualifi'd to render it acceptable, or rather le&s;s hurtful to the brain. The &s;cent of the Bea&s;t which I carri'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> was &s;o &s;trong, that I could not keep it in my Chamber; for it made all peoples heads ake that came neer it. At length my Servants laid it in a Garret, and cut off the bladder, and yet the &s;cent remain'd very &s;trong. This creature is not to be found in 65 degrees, but in 60 there are va&s;t numbers, the Countrey being all over co|ver'd with Forre&s;ts. True it is, that in the months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> after the&s;e creatures have endur'd a &s;harp hunger, by rea&s;on of the great Snows that fall where they breed, ten or twelve foot deep, they will come to 44 or 45 de|grees to fill them&s;elves with Corn and new Rice. And then it is that the Natives lay gins and &s;nares for them to catch them as they go back: &s;hooting &s;ome with Bows, and knocking others o'the head. Some have a&s;&s;ur'd me that they are &s;o lean and faint with hunger at that time, that you may almo&s;t take them running. There mu&s;t be &s;urely a prodigious number of the&s;e creatures, none of them having above one bladder no bigger then a Hen's-egg, which will not yield above half an ounce of Musk: and &s;ometimes three or four will not afford an ounce; and yet what a world of Musk is bought up?</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Boutan</HI> fearing that the cheats and adulterations of Musk would &s;poil the Musk-Trade, order'd that none of the Bladders &s;hould be &s;ow'd up, but that they &s;hould be all brought to <HI>Boutan,</HI> and there, after due in&s;pection, be &s;eal'd up with his Seal. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the warine&s;s and care of the King, they will &s;ometimes cunningly open them, and put in little pieces of Lead to augment the weight. In one Voyage to <HI>Patna</HI> I bought 7673 bladders, that weigh'd 2557 ounces and an half; and 452 ounces out of the bladder.</P>
<P>Bezoar comes from a Province of the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> toward the North|ea&s;t. It is found among the ordure in the paunch of a wild-Goat that browzes upon a certain Tree, the name whereof I have forgot. This &s;hrub bears little buds, round about which, and the tops of the boughs, the Bezoar engenders in
<PB N="154" REF="240">
the maw of the Goat. It is &s;hap'd according to the form of the buds or tops of the branches which the Goats eat: which is the rea&s;on there are &s;o many &s;hapes of Bezoar-Stones. The Natives, by feeling the belly of the Goat, know how many Stones &s;he has within, and &s;ell the Goat according to the quantity. This they will find out by &s;liding their hands under their bellies, and then &s;haking both &s;ides of the paunch; for the Stones will fall into the middle, where they may ea&s;ily count them all by their feeling.</P>
<P>The rarity of Bezoar is in the bigne&s;s; though the &s;mall Bezoar has the &s;ame vertue as that which is larger. But there is more deceit in the large Bezoar; for the Natives have got a trick to add to the bigne&s;s of the Stone, with a certain Pa&s;te compos'd of Gum, and &s;omething el&s;e of the colour of Bezoar. And they are &s;o cunning too, to &s;hape it ju&s;t like natural Bezoar. The cheat is found out two ways; the fir&s;t is by weighing the Bezoar, and then &s;teeping it in warm wa|ter; if neither the water change colour, nor the Bezoar lo&s;e any thing of its weight, the Stone is right. The other way is to thru&s;t a red-hot Bodkin of Iron into the Stone; if the Bodkin enters, and cau&s;es it to fry, there is a mixture. Be|zoar is dearer according to the bigne&s;s of the Stones, advancing in price like Dia|monds. For if five or &s;ix Bezoars weigh an ounce, an ounce will be worth fifteen or eighteen Franks; but if it be a Stone of one ounce, that very ounce is well worth 100 Franks. I have &s;old one of four ounces and a half for 2000 Li|vres.</P>
<P>I have been very curious to inform my &s;elf of all things that concern'd the nature of Bezoar; but could never learn in what part of the body of the Goat it was to be found. One time among the re&s;t, having oblig'd &s;everal Native Mer|chants by putting off for them a great quantity of Bezoar; upon my reque&s;t, though it be death without mercy to tran&s;port any of the&s;e Goats out of the Countrey, they brought me &s;ix Goats by &s;tealth to my lodging. When I ask'd the price of them, I was &s;urpriz'd, when they told me one was worth but three Roupies; that the two other were worth four Roupies; and the three others four and three quarters a piece. I ask'd them why &s;ome were more worth than others; but I found afterwards that the fir&s;t had but one Bezoar, that the re&s;t had two, or three, or four. The &s;ix Goats had in all &s;eventeen Bezoars in them, and a half one, as big as the half of a Hazel-nut. The in&s;ide was like the &s;oft ordure of the Goat, the Bezoar lying among the dung, which is in the belly of the Goat. Some averr'd that they grew right again&s;t the liver, others right again&s;t the heart, but I could never find out the truth.</P>
<P>As well in the Ea&s;t, as We&s;t, there are a great quantity of Bezoars that breed in the &s;ame manner in Cows; of which there have been &s;ome that have weigh'd &s;eventeen or eighteen ounces; For there was &s;uch a one that was giv'n to the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany.</HI> But tho&s;e Bezoars are little e&s;teem'd, &s;ix grains of the other Bezoar working more powerfully than thirty of this.</P>
<P>As for the Bezoar which breeds in Apes, as &s;ome belive, it is &s;o &s;trong, that two grains work as effectually as &s;ix of Goat's-Bezoar: but it is very &s;carce, as being only found in tho&s;e Apes that breed in the I&s;land of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar.</HI> This &s;ort of Be|zoar is round, whereas the other is of &s;everal fa&s;hions, as I &s;aid before. As the Apes Bezoar is &s;tronger, and &s;carcer than the Goats, &s;o it is dearer, and more &s;ought after; a piece as big as a nut, being &s;ometimes worth a hunder'd Crowns. The <HI>Portugals</HI> make great account of this Bezoar, &s;tanding always upon their guard for fear of being poi&s;on'd.</P>
<P>There is another Stone in great e&s;teem, that is call'd the Porcupine's-Stone, which that creature is &s;aid to carry in its head, and is more precious than Bezoar again&s;t poi&s;on. If it be &s;teep'd in water a quarter of an hour, the water becomes &s;o bitter, that nothing can be more bitter. There is al&s;o a Stone &s;ometimes found in the belly of that creature of the &s;ame nature; and as good as that which comes from the head; neverthele&s;s with this difference, that being &s;teep'd in water, it lo&s;es nothing of its weight nor bulk, as the other does. I have bought in my time three of tho&s;e Stones. One of them co&s;t me 500 Crowns, and I exchang'd it to advantage. I paid four-hunder'd Crowns for the other, which I kept, the other was &s;old me for 200 Crowns, which I pre&s;ented to a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="240">
There is the Serpent-Stone not to be forgot, about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>double;</HI> and &s;ome are almo&s;t oval, thick in the middle, and thin about the &s;ides. The <HI>In|dians</HI> report that it is bred in the head of certain Serpents. But I rather take it to be a Story of the Idoloter's Prie&s;ts, and that the Stone is rather a compo&s;ition of certain Drugs. Whatever it be, it is of excellent vertue to drive any venom out of tho&s;e that are bit by venomous creatures. If the per&s;on bit be not much wounded, the place mu&s;t be incis'd; and the Stone being appli'd thereto, will not fall off till it has drawn all the poi&s;on to it. To clean&s;e it, you mu&s;t &s;teep it in Womans-milk, or for want of that, in Cows-milk; after the Stone has lain ten or twelve hours, the milk will turn to the colour of an Apo&s;temated matter. The Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Goa</HI> carrying me to his Cabinet of Rarities, &s;hew'd me one of the&s;e Stones: and after he had a&s;&s;ur'd me of the rare qualities it had, gave it me. Once as he cro&s;s'd a Mer&s;h in the I&s;land of <HI>Sal&s;et&eacute;</HI> where <HI>Goa</HI> &s;tands, one of the men that carr'd his <HI>Pallequis,</HI> being half naked, was bit by a Serpent, and heal'd at the &s;ame time. I bought &s;everal; but there are none but the <HI>Bramines</HI> that &s;ell them, which makes me believe that they compound them. There are two ways to try whether the Serpent-Stone be true or fal&s;e. The fir&s;t is, by putting the Stone in your mouth, for then it will give a leap, aud fix to the Palate. The other is, by putting it in a gla&s;s full of water; for if the Stone be true, the wa|ter will fall a boyling, and ri&s;e in little bubbles up to the top of the Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>There is another Stone, which is call'd the Stephen's-Stone with the hood. This is a kind of Serpent that has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> a hood hanging down behind the head, as it is repre&s;ented in the Figure. And it is behind this hood that the Stone is found, many times as big as Pullet's-egg. There are &s;ome Serpents both in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>America</HI> of a mon&s;trous bigne&s;s, 25 foot long; as was that, the skin whereof is kept in <HI>Batavia,</HI> which had &s;wallow'd a Maid of 18 years of age. The&s;e Stones are not found in any of tho&s;e Serpents that are not at lea&s;t two foot long. This Stone being rubb'd again&s;t another Stone, yields <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;lime, which be|ing drank in water by the per&s;on that has the poi&s;on in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> powerfuly drives it out. The&s;e Serpents are no-where to be found but upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>Melinde;</HI> but for the Stones you may buy them of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Marin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s and Souldiers that come from <HI>Mozambique.</HI></P>

<P>There comes al&s;o Gold from <HI>China,</HI> which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> exchange for the Silver which is brought them. For price for price, they love Silver better than Gold; becau&s;e they have no Silver-Mines. Yet it is the coar&s;e&s;t metal of all the <HI>A&s;ia|tick</HI> Gold.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Celebes</HI> or <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> produces Gold al&s;o, which is drawn out of the Rivers, where it rowls among the Sand.</P>
<P>In the I&s;land of <HI>Achen</HI> or <HI>Sumatra,</HI> after the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when the Torrents are wa&s;ted, they find veins of Gold in the Flints, which the waters wa&s;h down from the Mountains that lye toward the North-ea&s;t.

I &s;hall now &s;ay &s;omething of the Gold of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the places where it is found in greate&s;t quantities.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve by the way, that the Vice-Roy of <HI>Mozambique</HI> has under his Com|mand the Governors of <HI>Sofala</HI> and <HI>Chepon-Goura.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e two Go|vernments lies upon the River <HI>Sene,</HI> &s;ixty leagues from the Mouth of the River; and the other ten leagues higher. From the Mouth of the River to tho&s;e very places on each &s;ide of the River, great numbers of Negro's inhabit, which are all commanded by one <HI>Portugueze.</HI> The <HI>Portuguezes</HI> have been Ma&s;ters of this Countrey for many years, where they take upon them like Lords, and make War one upon another for the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions in the World; &s;ome of them having under them five-thou&s;and <HI>Cafres,</HI> which are their Slaves. The Governor of <HI>Mo|zambique</HI> furni&s;hes them with Calicuts, and all other nece&s;&s;ary Commodities which they want, which he &s;ells them at his own rates. When he enters upon his Government he carries with him great quantities of all &s;orts of Commodities, e&s;pecially Calicuts dy'd black. His Corre&s;pondents al&s;o in <HI>Goa</HI> &s;end him every year two Ve&s;&s;els, which he &s;ends to <HI>Sofala, Chepon-Goura,</HI> and even as far as the City of <HI>Monomotopa,</HI> the chief City of a Kingdom of the &s;ame name, otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Vouvebaran,</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Chepon-Goura</HI> fifty leagues, or there-abouts. He that commands all that Countrey, a&s;&s;umes the name of Emperor of <HI>Monomotopa,</HI> extending his Dominions as far as the Confines of <HI>Pre&s;ter John</HI>'s Countrey. From this Country of <HI>Monomotopa</HI> it is, that the mo&s;t pure and fine&s;t Gold of all <HI>Africa</HI> comes: where they dig it with ea&s;e out of the earth&punc; not being put to labour above two or three foot deep. In &s;ome places of that Countrey which are not inhabited by rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of water, the people find great pieces of Gold, of &s;everal forms and weights, upon the &s;urface of the earth&punc; &s;ome of which weigh an ounce.

<P>The Natives of <HI>Monomotopa</HI> knowing the time of the year that the Commo|dities arrive, come to <HI>Sofala</HI> and <HI>Chepon-Goura</HI> to furni&s;h them&s;elves. Thither al&s;o come the <HI>Cafres</HI> of other Provinces and Kingdoms for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Whereupon the Governors of tho&s;e places &s;ell them what they want, tru&s;ting them till the next year, when they oblige them&s;elves to bring their Gold, which they are very punctual to do, for el&s;e there could be no Trade between them. The Natives of <HI>Monomotopa</HI> never live long, by rea&s;on of the badne&s;s of the wa|ters in the Countrey: For at the age of five and twenty years they begin to be drop&s;ical; &s;o that it is a great wonder if any among them live above forty years. The Province where the River <HI>Sene</HI> has its head, is call'd <HI>Monkaran,</HI> and is under the Juri&s;diction of a certain King, beginning a hunder'd leagues, or there-abouts, above <HI>Chapon-Goura.</HI> The people of that Country find great &s;tore of du&s;t-Gold in the Rivers that fall into the <HI>Sene;</HI> but it is much coar&s;er than the other, though they bring it to <HI>Chepon-Goura</HI> and <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Countrey is very healthy, and the people live as long as they do in <HI>Europe.</HI> Some years there are <HI>Cafres</HI> that come from beyond the Province of <HI>Monkaran,</HI> even as far as the <HI>Cape of good Hope.</HI> The <HI>Portuguez</HI> have enquir'd after their Countrey, and the name; but they can tell no more, only that it is call'd <HI>Sabia,</HI> commanded by a King; and that they are four months generally travelling to <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Gold which they bring is very fine, and in pieces like that of <HI>Monomotopa,</HI> which they &s;ay they find in the high Mountains, digging only ten or twelve foot in the ground. They al&s;o bring great quantities of Elephants-teeth; wherewith, by their report, the Countrey does &s;o abound, that you may &s;ee them in herds in the fields; and that all the Pali&s;ado's of their Fortre&s;&s;es, and the Pales of their Parks, are made of Elephants-teeth. Their u&s;ual Diet is Elephants-fle&s;h; which four <HI>Cafres</HI> will kill with their <HI>Ageagayes,</HI> or a &s;ort of Half-pikes. The water of their Countrey is very bad, which is the rea&s;on that their thighs are &s;well'd, and it is a wonder to &s;ee any one of them free.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Sofala</HI> there is a Countrey commanded by a King, who is call'd the King of <HI>Bero&eacute;.</HI> In &s;ome parts of his Countrey there grows a Root about an inch|thick, and of a yellow colour. It heals all &s;orts of Fevers, cau&s;ing the Patient to vomit. But becau&s;e it grows very &s;carce, the King &s;trictly forbids his Subjects to export it. The ta&s;t of it is very bitter upon the tongue.</P>
<P>As for Silver-Mines, there are none in all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> but only in <HI>Japon;</HI> but &s;ome years &s;ince, at <HI>Delegora, Sangora, Bordelon</HI> and <HI>Bata,</HI> have been di&s;cover'd plenti|ful Mines of Tin, to the great damage of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> there being now enough in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> of their own be&s;ides.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Relation of a Notable piece of Treachery, whereby the Author was abus'd when he Embark'd at <HI>Gomrom</HI> for <HI>Surat.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1665, being ready to depart from <HI>Gomrom</HI> for <HI>Surat,</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el that belong'd to a <HI>Holland</HI>-Broaker, commanded by a <HI>Holland</HI>-Captain, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Agent gave me a Packet of Letters to deliver to the Pre&s;ident at <HI>Surat.</HI> The Packet was large, containing not only the Companies-Letters, but &s;everal private Letters to particular per&s;ons at <HI>Surat</HI> and other parts of <HI>India.</HI> This Packet I receiv'd in the pre&s;ence of one <HI>Ca&s;embrot,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who inform'd another <HI>Dutch-man,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Wauwuck,</HI> of it: Thereupon they pre&s;ently
<PB N="158" REF="242">
contriv'd a de&s;ign to &s;eize this Packet, upon the report that ran of the rupture between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland. Ca&s;embrot</HI> having &s;een the bigne&s;s of the Packet, gives <HI>Wauwuck</HI> a di&s;cription of it, and &s;o both together they contrive another of the &s;ame form and bigne&s;s as neer as they could. When I came a-board, I took the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Packet, and lock'd it up in my <HI>Bouccha,</HI> which is the &s;ort of Cloak|bag that is us'd in that Countrey, and laid it behind my <HI>Bolster.</HI> There were two Shallops &s;ent a-board us, wherein there were &s;ixty bags of Silver, containing &s;ome fifty, &s;ome a hunder'd <HI>Tomans</HI> a piece. The&s;e bags they unladed very lei&s;urely to gain time, watching when I would be gone to bed. But when they &s;aw that I did not go to re&s;t, the <HI>Dutch</HI> con&s;ulted together, and agreed to let fall a bag of <HI>Tomans</HI> into the Sea; and &s;o came all a-board, &s;ending away a Shallop to <HI>Gomron</HI> for a Di|ver. When I found that the Ve&s;&s;el would not &s;et Sail till two or three hours after day-light, I went to re&s;t, my <HI>Bouccha</HI> lying in the &s;ame place, half out, and half with in-&s;ide of my Bol&s;ter: But when my Servants were gone, and I alone and a-&s;leep in the Cabin, they cunningly &s;tole my <HI>Bouccha,</HI> took out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Packet, and left the other which they had counterfeited, in the place; being only &s;o many Letters of blanck-paper. Coming to <HI>Surat</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>May</HI> following, I gave the Packet, as I thought, which I had receiv'd from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Agent at <HI>Gomron,</HI> to two Capuchin-Friers to deliver to the Pre&s;ident at <HI>Surat.</HI> But when the Pre&s;i|dent came to open the Packet before &s;everal of the Company, there was nothing but white-paper made up in the form of Letters; which when I heard, too much to my &s;orrow, I under&s;tood the villanous trick that <HI>Van-Wuck</HI> had put upon me. I wrote a &s;mart Letter of complaint to the <HI>Dutch</HI>-General in <HI>Batavia,</HI> but finding no redre&s;s, was forc'd to undergo the hard cen&s;ure of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who would not permit me to ju&s;tify my &s;elf. However, as it is rare to &s;ee treachery go un|puni&s;h'd, the Complotters all dy'd mi&s;erably. <HI>Van-Wuck</HI> fell into a violent Fe|ver, and being charg'd with the theft; thinking to defend him&s;elf with an equi|vocation, that if he took the Cloak-bag, he wi&s;h'd he might dye without &s;peak|ing a word, in three days ended his life ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, and at the &s;ame time that he had imprecated upon him&s;elf. <HI>Bozan</HI> his Lieutenant, after a great debauch, going to &s;leep upon the Terra&s;s of the Cabin, where he lay for coolne&s;s, (there being no bali&s;ters,) rolling and tumbling in his &s;leep, fell down, and the next day was found dead in the Sea.</P>
<P>The Captain, four or five days after his arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI> being met in the Street by a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> who was jealous of his Wife, and being mi&s;tak'n by him for one among &s;everal Franks, that had parted him, and kept him from correcting his Wife &s;ome few days before, was &s;tabb'd by him in three or four places with a Dagger, and kill'd him out right.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the particular Religion of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE diver&s;ity of Opinions among the <HI>Maahometans,</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t in the different Expo&s;itions which they put upon the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> but in the contrariety of Belief which they receiv'd by Tradition from the fir&s;t Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> From thence there &s;prung two Sects, directly oppo&s;ite: The one, which is call'd the Sect of the <HI>Sounnis,</HI> fol|low'd by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the other of the <HI>Chiais,</HI> which is adher'd to by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> I will not enlarge my &s;elf upon the&s;e two Sects, that divide all <HI>Ma|humeti&s;m;</HI> it being my de&s;ign, only to tell you how the condition of that fal&s;e Religion &s;tands in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and in the Kingdoms of <HI>Gol|conda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Mahumeti&s;m</HI> was fir&s;t brought into the <HI>Indies,</HI> there was an exce&s;s of pride, but no devotion among the Chri&s;tians; and the Idolaters were an effe|minate people, able to make little re&s;i&s;tence; &s;o that it was ea&s;ie for the <HI>Ma|humetans</HI> to &s;ubdue both the one and the other by force of Arms, which they did &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that many, as well Chri&s;tians as Idolaters, embrac'd the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> with all his Court, follows the Sect of the <HI>Sounnis;</HI> the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> that of the <HI>Chiais.</HI> In the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI>'s Territories the <HI>Sounnis</HI> and <HI>Chiais</HI> are mingl'd together; which may be &s;aid al&s;o of the Court of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> in regard of the great numbers of <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that flock thi|ther to &s;erve in his Armies. True it is, that though they abhor the <HI>Sounnis,</HI> yet they adhere to the Religion of the Prince; holding it lawful for the pre|&s;ervation of their E&s;tates to conceal their belief. As for what concerns the King|dom of <HI>Golconda, Koutoub-Cha,</HI> the pre&s;ent King, very zealou&s;ly maintains the Law of the <HI>Chiais;</HI> in regard the Grandees of his Court are almo&s;t all <HI>Per|&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> te&s;tifies above all things an extraordinary devotion for the Sect of the <HI>Sounnis;</HI> of which he is &s;o zealous an ob&s;erver, that he &s;urpa&s;&s;es all his Predece&s;&s;ors in outward profe&s;&s;ion; which was the Cloak under which he u&s;urp'd the Crown. When he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Throne, he gave it out that he did it only out of a de&s;ign to cau&s;e the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be more &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, which had been very much neglected in the Reign of <HI>Sha-jehan</HI> his Father, and <HI>Gehan-guir</HI> his Grandfather; and to &s;hew him&s;elf more zealous to the Law, he turn'd <HI>Faquir</HI> or <HI>Dervich,</HI> that is, poor Volunteer; and

<P>THey reckon that there are in the <HI>Indies</HI> eight hundred thou&s;and <HI>Faquirs,</HI> and twelve hunder'd thou&s;and Idolaters; which is a prodigious Number. They are all of them Vagabonds, and lazy Drones, that dazle the eyes of the people with a fal&s;e zeal, and make them believe that whatever comes out of their mouths is an Oracle.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Mahometan Faquirs.</HI> The one &s;ort go almo&s;t naked like the Idolatrous <HI>Faquirs,</HI> having no certain abode in the world, but giving them&s;elves up to all manner of uncleanne&s;s. There are others who&s;e Garments are of &s;o many different pieces and colours, that a man can hardly tell of what they are made. The&s;e Garments reach down to the half Leg, and hide the rags that are underneath. They go generally in Troops; and have their Superiour of the Gang, who is known by his Garment, which is generally poorer, and con&s;i&s;ts of more patches than the other. Be&s;ides, that he draws after him a great Iron Chain, which is ty'd to his Leg, and is about two Ells long, and proportionably thick. When he &s;ays his prayers, he does it with a loud voice, and ratling his Chain all the while, which is accompany'd with an affected gra|vity, that draws the Veneration of the people. In the mean time the people prepare Dinner for him and his company, in the place where he takes up his &s;tand, which is u&s;ually in &s;ome &s;treet or publick place. There he cau&s;es his Di&s;ciples to &s;pread certain Carpets, where he &s;ets him&s;elf down to give audi|ence to the people. On the other &s;ide, the Di&s;ciples go about publi&s;hing through the Country the vertues of their Ma&s;ter, and the favours he receives from God, who reveals his mo&s;t important &s;ecrets to him, and gives him power to relieve per&s;ons in affliction by his coun&s;el. The people, who give credit to him, and believe him to be a holy man, approach him with a great devotion, and when they come near him, they pull off their Shoes, and pro&s;trate them|&s;elves to ki&s;s his feet. Then the <HI>Faquir,</HI> to &s;hew his humility reaches out his hand to ki&s;s; that done, he cau&s;es them that come to con&s;ult him, to &s;it down by him, and hears every one apart. They boa&s;t them&s;elves to have a prophetick Spirit; and above all to teach barren women a way how to have Children, and to be belov'd by whom they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> who have above two hundred Di&s;ciples, or more, which they a&s;&s;emble together by the &s;ound of a Horn, or the Beat of a Drum. When they travel, they have their Standard, Lances, and other Wea|pons which they pitch in the ground, near to their Ma&s;ter, when he repo&s;es in any place.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort of Ea&s;t <HI>Indian Faquirs,</HI> are tho&s;e that being born of poor Pa|rents, and de&s;irous to under&s;tand the Law, to the end they may become <HI>Moulla's</HI> or Doctors, retire to the <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> where they live upon the Alms which is given them. They employ all their time in reading the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which they get by heart; and if they can but add to that &s;tudy the knowledg of &s;ome natural things, and an exemplary life withall, they come to be chief of the <HI>Mo&s;|quees,</HI> and to the dignity of <HI>Moullahs,</HI> and Judges of the Law. Tho&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> have their Wives; and &s;ome, out of their great zeal to imitate <HI>Mahomet,</HI> have three or four; thinking they do God great &s;ervice in begetting many Children to be followers of their Laws.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> or Idolatrous <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Idolaters among the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;o numerous, that they are reckon'd to be five or &s;ix for one <HI>Mahometan.</HI> It &s;eems a wonderful thing, that &s;uch a prodigious multitude of men &s;hould be cow'd by a handful, and how &s;o ea&s;ily under the yoak of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes. But that wonder well may cea&s;e, when we con&s;ider that tho&s;e Idolaters are not in union among them&s;elves; for Super&s;tition has introduc'd &s;uch a diver&s;ity of Opinions and Cu&s;toms, that they can never agree one with another. An Idolater will not eat Bread nor drink Water in the Hou&s;e of any one that is not of his <HI>Ca&s;te;</HI> though it be more noble, and much more &s;uperior to his own. Yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> all eat and drink in the <HI>Bramins</HI> Hou&s;es, which are open to all the world. A <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> a|mong the Idolaters, is very near the &s;ame thing which was anciently call'd a Tribe among the Jews. And though it be vulgarly believ'd, that there are &s;e|venty two <HI>Castes,</HI> yet I have been inform'd by &s;ome of their mo&s;t ingennous Prie&s;ts, that they may all be reduc'd into four Principal ones, from whence all the re&s;t drew their Original.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> is that of the <HI>Bramins,</HI> who are the Succe&s;&s;ors of the an|cient <HI>Brachmans,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Philo&s;ophers, that &s;tudy'd A&s;trology. You may al&s;o meet with &s;ome of their Ancient Books, in reading whereof the <HI>Brammins</HI> &s;pend all their time; and are &s;o vers'd in their ob&s;ervations, that they never fail a minute in the Eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon. And to pre&s;erve this knowledg among them&s;elves they have a kind of Univer&s;ity, in a City which is call'd <HI>Benarez,</HI> where they make all their exerci&s;es in A&s;trology, and where they have Doctors that expound their Law, which they very &s;trictly ob&s;erve. But in regard they are &s;o great a number, and cannot all come to &s;tudy at that Uni|ver&s;ity, they are all very ignorant, and con&s;equently very &s;uper&s;titious; tho&s;e that go for the mo&s;t refin'd Wits, being the greate&s;t Sorcerers.</P>
<P>The &s;econd <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> is that of the <HI>Ra&s;poutes</HI> or <HI>Ketris,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Warriors and warlike people. The&s;e are the only Idolatrous <HI>Indians</HI> that have any cou|rage to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in War. All the <HI>Raja's</HI> that I have &s;o often mem|tion'd, are of this <HI>Ca&s;te.</HI> The&s;e are &s;o many petty Kings, whom their di&s;union has render'd Tributary to the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> But in regard that the greate&s;t part of them are in his &s;ervice, they are highly recompenc'd by the large Salaries they receive for the &s;mall Tribute which they pay. The&s;e <HI>Raja's,</HI> and the <HI>Ra&s;poutes</HI> their Subjects, are the chiefe&s;t &s;upport of the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mogul;</HI> for indeeed the <HI>Raja's Je&s;&s;eing</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eing</HI> were tho&s;e that lifted up <HI>Aureng|zeb</HI> to the Throne. But you mu&s;t take notice, that all of this &s;econd <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> are not Warriors; for they are the <HI>Ra&s;poutes</HI> only that go to War, and are all Hor&s;emen. But for the <HI>Ketris,</HI> they are degenerated from their Ance&s;tors, and of Soldiers are become Merchants.</P>
<P>The third Ca&s;te is that of the <HI>Bannians,</HI> who are altogether addicted to Trade; of whom &s;ome are <HI>Sheraffs</HI> or Bankers, others Broakers, employ'd be|tween Merchant and Merchant for buying and &s;elling. Tho&s;e of this <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> are &s;o &s;ubtil and nimble in Trade, that as I have &s;aid before, the <HI>Jews</HI> may be their Prentices. They accu&s;tom their Children betimes to fly Idlene&s;s. And in&s;tead of &s;uffering them to lo&s;e their time in playing in the Streets, as we generally do, they teach them Arithmetick; which they are &s;o perfect at, that without making u&s;e either of Pen or Ink, or Counters, but only of their memories, they will in a moment ca&s;t up the mo&s;t difficult account that can be imagin'd. They always live with their Fathers, who in&s;truct them in Trade, and do nothing but what they &s;hew them. If any man in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion chafe at 'em, they hear him patiently without making any reply, and parting coldly from him, will not &s;ee him again in three or four days, when they think his pa&s;&s;ion may be over. They never eat any thing that has life; nay they would rather dye,
<PB N="162" REF="244">
than kill the &s;malle&s;t Animal or Vermin that crawls; being in that point above all things the mo&s;t zealous Ob&s;ervers of the Law. They never fight, nor go to War; neither will they eat or drink in the Hou&s;e of a <HI>Ra&s;poute,</HI> becau&s;e they kill the Victuals they eat, all but Cows, which they never touch.</P>
<P>The fourth <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> is that of the <HI>Charados</HI> or <HI>Soudras;</HI> who go to War as well as the <HI>Ra&s;poutes,</HI> but with this difference, that the <HI>Ra&s;poutes</HI> &s;erve on Hor&s;e|back, and the <HI>Charados</HI> on foot. Both of them take it for an Honour to dye in Battel; and let him be Hor&s;e or Foot, that Soldier is accounted infamous that retreats in Fight; 'tis an eternal blot in his Family. Upon which &s;ubject I will tell you a &s;tory. A Soldier who was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with his Wife, and reciprocally belov'd by her, had fled from the fight, not &s;o much out of any fear of death, as out of a con&s;ideration of the grief which it would oc|ca&s;ion to his Wife, &s;hould he leave her a Widow. When &s;he knew the rea&s;on of his flight, as &s;oon as he came to the door, &s;he &s;hut it again&s;t him, and or|der'd him to be told, that &s;he could never acknowledg that man for a Husband, who had preferr'd the Love of a Woman before his Honour; that &s;he did not de&s;ire to &s;ee him any more, as being a &s;tain to the Reputation of her Family; and that &s;he would endeavour to teach her Children to have more courage than their Father. The Wife continuing firm to her re&s;olution, the Husband to re|gain his Honour and her affection, return'd to the Army, where he &s;o behav'd him&s;elf, that he became famous; and having highly made amends for his Cow|ardi&s;e, the door of his Hou&s;e was again &s;et open, and his Wife receiv'd him with her former kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Natives, that are not reckon'd in the number of the&s;e <HI>Ca&s;tes,</HI> are call'd <HI>Pauzecour.</HI> The&s;e are &s;uch as employ them&s;elves in Handicraft Trades; among which there is no other di&s;tinction, but according to the Trades which they follow from Father to Son. So that a Taylor cannot prefer his Son, but only in his own Calling, though he be never &s;o rich; nor marry either a Son or Daughter, but to one of his own Craft. By the &s;ame rule, when a Taylor dies, all tho&s;e of his own Trade accompany the corps to the place where it is burnt: and the &s;ame practi&s;e is ob&s;erv'd in all other Trades.</P>
<P>Among the particular <HI>Ca&s;tes,</HI> there is one that goes by the name of <HI>Alecors,</HI> who&s;e employment is only to clean Hou&s;es; for which every Family pays him &s;omething once a month, according to their proportion and quality. If a per&s;on of quality in the <HI>Indies</HI> keeps fifty Servants, let him be <HI>Mahometan</HI> or Idola|ter, there isnot one of them will take a Be&s;ome in his hand to &s;weep the Hou&s;e; for he would think him&s;elf affronted, it being one of the greate&s;t &s;corns you can put upon an <HI>Indian,</HI> to call him <HI>Alacor.</HI> Be&s;ides, every one of tho&s;e Servants knows his bu&s;ine&s;s; whether it be to carry the pot of Water to drink by the way, or to give his Ma&s;ter his Pipe of Tobacco when he calls for it; &s;o that if the Ma&s;ter &s;hould bid one to do that which the other was ap|pointed to do, that Servant would &s;tand like a Statue, and never make him any an&s;wer. But for the Slaves, they are oblig'd to do what ever the Ma&s;ter commands them.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kings and Idolatrous Princes of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe chiefe&s;t of the Idolatrous Kings of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> are the King of <HI>Aracan,</HI> the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> the King of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and the King of <HI>Tun|quin.</HI> As for the King of <HI>China,</HI> we know that he was an Idolater before the <HI>Tartars</HI> invaded his Dominions. But &s;ince that, we know not what to report of certainty, in regard that the <HI>Tartars</HI> who are now Ma&s;ters of the Country, are neither Idolaters nor <HI>Mahometans,</HI> but rather both together. In the I&s;lands, the King of <HI>Japon,</HI> the King of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> and &s;ome petty Kings of the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands are Idolaters; as are all the <HI>Raja's</HI> as well in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> as in the neighbouring Kingdoms of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and <HI>Golconda.</HI> In a word, all the meaner &s;ort of people, as well in the Territories of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> as in the I&s;les of <HI>Achan, Java,</HI> and <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> though their Kings are <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> are all them&s;elves Idolaters.</P>
<P>Some fifty years ago, one of the Kings of <HI>Ceylan</HI> became a Chri&s;tian, and was baptiz'd by the name of <HI>John,</HI> being call'd before the Emperor <HI>Priapen|der.</HI> But as &s;oon as he had embrac'd the Chri&s;tian Faith, the Princes and Prie&s;ts of the Country &s;et up another King in his room. He endeavour'd all he could to bring his people to follow his example; to which purpo&s;e he a&s;&s;ign'd to the Father <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> twelve large Villages about <HI>Colombo,</HI> for the bringing up the youth of the Country in their Colledges; to the end that they being well in&s;tructed, might in&s;truct others. For the King made it plain to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them &s;o well to under&s;tand the Language of the Country, as to be able to preach to the Natives. Be&s;ides, that they found the ingenuities of the Youth of <HI>Ceylan</HI> &s;o quick and apprehen&s;ive, that they learnt more La|tin, Philo&s;ophy, and other Sciences in &s;ix months, than the <HI>Europeans</HI> learnt in a year; and that they put &s;uch &s;ubtle Que&s;tions to their Ma&s;ters, as were be|yond imagination.</P>
<P>Some years after the King had profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tianity, a witty man of the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> and a good natural Philo&s;opher, who&s;e name was <HI>Alegamme, Motiar,</HI> or the Ma&s;ter of the Philo&s;ophers, after he had convers'd with the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and other Religious per&s;ons, was in&s;pir'd to turn Chri&s;tian. Thereupon he went to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and told them, that he de&s;ir'd to be a Chri&s;tian; but withall he was very earne&s;t to know what Je&s;us Chri&s;t had done, and left in writing. They gave him the new Te&s;tament, which he &s;et him&s;elf to read with that heed and &s;tudy, that in le&s;s than &s;ix months there was hardly a pa&s;&s;age which he could not repeat. After that he again te&s;tifi'd to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and o|ther Religious per&s;ons, that he had a great de&s;ire to turn Chri&s;tian, in regard he found their Religion to be &s;uch as Je&s;us Chri&s;t had taught; but only he won|der'd that they them&s;elves did not follow his example. For that he could ne|ver find by his reading, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t ever took any money of any body; but that they took all they could get, and never baptiz'd nor buri'd unle&s;s they were well paid. But though he &s;tarted the Que&s;tion, he was baptiz'd, and afterwards became a &s;edulous converter of others.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What the Idolaters believe touching a Divinity.</HEAD>
<P>THough the Idolatrous <HI>Indians</HI> attribute to the Creature, as to Cows, Apes, and &s;everal Mon&s;ters, tho&s;e Divine Honours which are only due to the true Diety; yet they acknowledge one only Infinite God, Almighty, and only Wi&s;e, the Creator of Heaven and earth, who fills all places with his pre&s;ence. They call him in &s;ome places <HI>Perme&s;&s;er,</HI> in others <HI>Peremael,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tnon</HI> among the <HI>Bramins</HI> that inhabit the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel.</HI> It may be, becau&s;e they have heard that the Circle is the mo&s;t perfect of all Figures, therefore it is that they &s;ay God is of an Oval Figure; for they have in all their Pagods an Oval Flint&s;tone, which they fetch from <HI>Ganges,</HI> and wor&s;hip as a God. They are &s;o ob&s;tinately wedded to this fooli&s;h imagination that the wi&s;e&s;t among the <HI>Bra|mins</HI> will not &s;o much as hear any argument to the contrary. So that it is no wonder that a people led by &s;uch blind Guides, &s;hould fall into &s;uch Aby&s;&s;es of Idolatry. There is one Tribe &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, in reference to that article, that they carry tho&s;e Oval Flints about their Necks, and beat them again&s;t their Brea&s;ts, when they are at their devotions. In this dark and lamentable mi&s;t of ignorance, the&s;e Idolaters make their Gods to be born like men, and a&s;&s;ign them Wives, imagining that theirs are the plea&s;ures of men. Thus they take their <HI>Ram</HI> for a great Deity, in regard of the Miracles which they believe he wrought while he liv'd upon Earth. <HI>Ram</HI> was the Son of a potent <HI>Raja,</HI> who was call'd by the name of <HI>De&s;eret,</HI> and the mo&s;t vertuous of all his Children, which he had by two lawful Wives. He was particular belov'd by his Father, who de&s;ign'd him to be his Succe&s;&s;or. But the Mother of <HI>Ram</HI> being dead, the <HI>Raja's</HI> other Wife, who had her Husband entirely at her beck, prevail'd with him to exterminate <HI>Ram</HI> and his Brother <HI>Lokeman</HI> from his Hou&s;e, and all his Territories; upon who&s;e exclu&s;ion the Son of that Wife was declar'd the <HI>Raja's</HI> Succe&s;&s;or. As the two Brothers were about to be gone, <HI>Ram</HI>'s Wife <HI>Sita,</HI> of whom he went to take his leave, and whom the Idolaters wor&s;hip as a Godde&s;s, beg'd of him that &s;he might not leave him, having made a re&s;o|lution never to for&s;ake him; whereupon they all three went together to &s;eek their fortunes. They were not very &s;ucce&s;sful at fir&s;t; for as they pa&s;s'd through a Wood, <HI>Ram</HI> being in pur&s;uit of a Bird, &s;tray'd from the Company, and was mi&s;&s;ing a long time; in&s;omuch that <HI>Sita</HI> fearing that &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter was befall'n him, befought <HI>Lokeman</HI> to look after him. He excus'd him&s;elf at fir&s;t, by rea|&s;on that <HI>Ram</HI> had oblig'd him never to leave <HI>Sita</HI> alone, fore&s;eeing by a Pro|phetick Spirit what would befall her, &s;hould &s;he be left to her &s;elf. Never|thele&s;s <HI>Lokeman</HI> being over per&s;waded by the prayers of his fair Si&s;ter, went to &s;eek for <HI>Ram</HI> his Brother; but in the mean time <HI>Rhevan</HI> another of the I|dolaters Gods, appear'd to <HI>Sita</HI> in the &s;hape of a <HI>Faquir,</HI> and beg'd an Alms of her. Now <HI>Ram</HI> had order'd <HI>Sita,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould not &s;tir out of the place where he left her; which <HI>Rhevan</HI> well knowing, would not receive the Alms which <HI>Sita</HI> pre&s;ented him, unle&s;s &s;he would remove to another place; which when <HI>Sita</HI> had done, either out of negligence or forgetfulne&s;s, <HI>Rhevan</HI> &s;eiz'd upon her, and carry'd her into the thick of the Wood, where his Train &s;tay'd for him. <HI>Ram</HI> at his return mi&s;&s;ing <HI>Sita,</HI> fell into a &s;woon for grief, but be|ing brought again to him&s;elf by his Brother <HI>Lokeman,</HI> they two immediately went together in &s;earch of <HI>Sita,</HI> who was &s;o dearly belov'd by her Husband.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Bramins</HI> repeat this Rape of their Godde&s;s, they do it with tears in their eyes, and great demon&s;trations of &s;orrow; adding upon this &s;ubject, an infinite company of Fables more ridiculous, to &s;hew the great courage of <HI>Ram</HI> in pur&s;uit of the Ravi&s;her. They employ'd all Creatures living upon the di&s;covery; but none of them had the luck to &s;ucceed, only the Monkey call'd <HI>Harman.</HI> He cro&s;s'd over the Sea at one Leap, and coming into <HI>Rhevans</HI> Gar|dens, found <HI>Sita</HI> in the extremity of affliction; and very much &s;urpriz'd to hear

an Ape &s;peak to her in her Husbands behalf. At fir&s;t &s;he would not give any credit to &s;uch an Amba&s;&s;ador; but the Ape, to &s;hew that his Commi&s;&s;ion was authentick, pre&s;ents her with a Ring which her Husband had giv'n her, and that &s;he had left behind her among her Furniture. She could hardly however believe &s;o great a Miracle, as that <HI>Ram</HI> her Husband &s;hould make a Bea&s;t &s;peak, to bring her the news of his health, and to te&s;tifie as he did the marks of his affection. But the Ape <HI>Harman</HI> wrought Miracles him&s;elf, for being taken for a Spy by &s;ome <HI>Rhevans</HI> Servants, who therefore would have burnt him, he made u&s;e of the fire which they had prepar'd to burn him, to &s;et <HI>Rhevans</HI> Pa|lace on fire, which he almo&s;t con&s;um'd to the ground, with all the tatters and rags which were ty'd to his tail and his body. When the Ape had thus done, the better to e&s;cape out of <HI>Rhevans</HI> hands, he took the &s;ame way he came, and repa&s;&s;ing the Sea again at one jump, he came and gave <HI>Ram</HI> an account of his adventures; and told him in what a &s;orrowful condition he had found <HI>Sita,</HI> who did nothing but mourn by rea&s;on of her ab&s;ence from her Husband. <HI>Ram</HI> touch'd with his Wives affection, re&s;olv'd to deliver her out of <HI>Rhevans</HI> hands, whatever it co&s;t him; whereupon he rais'd Forces, and being guided by the Ape, at length he came to <HI>Rhevans</HI> Palace, that &s;till &s;moak'd, the fire had been &s;o great; and by rea&s;on that <HI>Rhevans</HI> Servants were di&s;pers'd, <HI>Ram</HI> had an ea&s;ie opportunity to &s;ee his belov'd <HI>Sita</HI> again, whom <HI>Rhevan</HI> aban|don'd wholly to him, flying for fear to the Mountains. <HI>Ram</HI> and <HI>Sita</HI> were infinitely overjoy'd at their coming together again, and return'd very great Honours to <HI>Harman,</HI> who had done him &s;o great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rhevan,</HI> he &s;pent all the re&s;t of his days like a poor <HI>Faquir,</HI> &s;eeing his Country ruin'd by <HI>Ram</HI>'s Troops, who was re&s;olv'd to be reveng'd for the injury which he had receiv'd; and from this <HI>Rhevan</HI> it was, from whence that infinite multitude of <HI>Faquirs,</HI> that &s;warm all over <HI>India,</HI> fir&s;t took their Ori|ginal.</P>

<P>THE Original of the <HI>Faquirs,</HI> as I &s;aid before, came from that <HI>Rhevan,</HI> whom <HI>Ram</HI> di&s;poil'd of his Kingdom; at which he conceiv'd &s;uch an un|&s;peakable &s;orrow, that he re&s;olv'd to lead a Vagabond life, and to wander about the world, poor, &s;tript of all, and in a manner quite naked. He found enough to follow him in a cour&s;e of life that gives them &s;o much liberty. For being wor&s;hip'd as Saints, they have in their hands all opportunities of doing evil.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> wander generally in Troops, every one of which has a Supe|rior. And in regard they are quite naked, Winter and Summer lying upon the hard ground, when it is cold, the young <HI>Faquirs,</HI> and others that are mo&s;t de|vout, go in the afternoon to &s;eek for the dungs of Cows and other Creatures, of which they make their fires. They rarely burn Wood, for fear of killing any living Animal which is wont to breed in it; and therefore the Wood where|with they burn their dead, is only &s;uch as has floated long in the Water, which never breeds in any &s;ort of living Creature. The young <HI>Faquirs</HI> having got toge|ther a good quantity of dung, mix'd with dry turf, make &s;everal fires, accor|ding to the bigne&s;s of the Company; round about every one of which the <HI>Fa|quirs</HI> &s;eat them&s;elves.

<P>The Crews of <HI>Faquirs</HI> many time joyn together to go in Pilgrimage to the Principal Pagods, and publick Wa&s;hings, which they u&s;e upon certain dayes in the year in the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> whereof they make the chiefe&s;t account; as al&s;o in that which &s;eparates the Territories of the <HI>Portugals</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> from the Dominions of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI> Some of the mo&s;t au&s;tere <HI>Faquirs</HI> live in little pitti|ful Huts neer their Pagods, where they have once in four and twenty hours &s;ome|thing to eat be&s;tow'd upon them for God's &s;ake.

The <HI>Franks</HI> call it the <HI>Bannians</HI>-Tree, becau&s;e in tho&s;e places where tho&s;e Trees grow, the Idolaters always take up their quar|ters, and dre&s;s their victuals under them. They have tho&s;e Trees in great re|verence, and oft-times build their Pagods either under or very neer them. That which the Reader &s;ees here de&s;crib'd, grows at <HI>Surat;</HI> in the trunk whereof, which is hollow, is the figure of a Mon&s;ter, repre&s;enting the face of a deform'd Woman, which they &s;ay was the fir&s;t Woman, who&s;e name was <HI>Mamaniva;</HI> thi|ther great numbers of Idolaters every day re&s;ort: neer to which there is &s;ome <HI>Bramin</HI> or other always appointed to be ready to &s;ay Prayers, and receive the Alms of Rice, Millet, and other Grains which the charitable be&s;tow upon them. The <HI>Bramin</HI> marks the forhead of all, both Men and Woman, that come to pray in the Pagod, with a kind of Vermillion, wherewith he al&s;o be&s;mears the Idol; for being thus mark'd, they belive the evil Spirit cannot hurt them, as being then under the protection of their God.</P>

My curio&s;ity carri'd me to &s;ee one of tho&s;e penitents, which the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Company, who &s;et a &s;py to watch night and day whether any body brought him any victuals.

Their hair grows down to their wa&s;ts, and their nails are as long as their fingers. Night and Day, Winter and Summer they go always &s;tark naked in the &s;ame po&s;ture, expos'd to the heat and rain, and the &s;tinging of the Flies; from which they have not the u&s;e of their hands to rid them&s;elves.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Idolaters belief touching the e&s;tate of the Soul after death.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS an Article of the Idolaters Faith, that the Souls of Men departing out of the body, are pre&s;ented to God; who according to the lives which they lead, orders them another body to inhabit. So that one and the &s;ame per&s;on is born &s;everal times into the World. And that as for the Souls of wicked and vi|cious per&s;ons, God di&s;po&s;es them into the bodies of contemptable Bea&s;ts, &s;uch as A&s;&s;es, Dogs, Cats, and the like; to do Penance for their crimes in tho&s;e infamous Pri&s;ons. But they believe that tho&s;e Souls that enter into Cows are happy; pre|&s;uming that there is a divinity in tho&s;e creatures. For if a man dye with a Cows-tail in his hand, they &s;ay it is enough to render him happy in the other World.</P>
<P>The Idolaters believing thus the tran&s;migration of the Souls of men into the bodies of other creatures, they abhor to kill any creature whatever, for fear they &s;hould be guilty of the death of &s;ome of their kindred or friends doing Penance in tho&s;e bodies.</P>
<P>If the Men in their life-time are famous for their vertuous deeds, they hold that their Souls pa&s;s into the bodies of &s;ome Potent <HI>Raja's:</HI> where they enjoy the plea&s;ures of this life in tho&s;e bodies, as the reward of tho&s;e good works which they did.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on why the <HI>Faquirs</HI> put them&s;elves to &s;uch horrible Penances. But becau&s;e that all are not able to endure &s;o much torment in this World, they labour to &s;upply the defect of that cruel Penance by good works.

In my la&s;t Voyage I bought of one of the&s;e Idolaters &s;ixty-two Diamonds of about &s;ix grains a-piece; and while I was wondring to &s;ee &s;o fair a parcel, he told me I needed not to wonder; for he had been fifty years getting them to|gether&punc; to &s;erve him after his death, but that having occa&s;ion for Money, he was forc'd to part with them. This buried trea&s;ure &s;tood the <HI>Raja-Seva-Gi</HI> in great &s;tead, when he took Arms again&s;t the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI> For that <HI>Raja</HI> having taken <HI>Callian Biondi,</HI> a &s;mall City in the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;a|pour,</HI> by the advice of the <HI>Bramins,</HI> who a&s;&s;ur'd him he &s;hould find great &s;tore of trea&s;ure buri'd, caus'd the greate&s;t part thereof to be demoli&s;h;d and found &s;o much wealth, as to maintain his Army, which was above thirty-thou&s;and Men. It is impo&s;&s;ible to convince the&s;e poor Idolaters of their errors; in regard they will hear no rea&s;on, but &s;ubmit them&s;elves altogether to their old forms and cu|&s;toms.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Cu&s;tom among the Idolaters to burn the Bodies of their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>THE cu&s;tom of burning the Bodies of the dead is very ancient among the Gentiles; which Ceremony they mo&s;t commonly perform by the banks of Rivers, where they wa&s;h the dead; which is the la&s;t purgation of them from their &s;ins. Nay, their &s;uper&s;tition is &s;o great &s;ometimes, that they will carry the &s;ick per&s;on, death approaching, to the bank of &s;ome River or Pond, and put his feet in the water. As nature fails, they dip him deeper and deeper, till at length they hold him expiring up to the chin in the River: to the end that the &s;ame time that the Soul departs out of the Body, both Body and Soul may be cleans'd from all defilement; and then plunging the newly dead Body over head and ears, they bring it out, and burn it in the place appointed; which is generally neer &s;ome Pa|god. There are &s;ome per&s;ons that make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to fetch Wood, and agree what they &s;hall have for their pains. An Idolater being dead, all tho&s;e of his <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> or Tribe a&s;&s;emble together at the Hou&s;e of the deceas'd, and laying the Body upon a Bier cover'd with clean fine Linnen according to his Quality and E&s;tate, they follow the Bier, which is carri'd by &s;uch as are appointed for that purpo&s;e to the place where the Body is to be burn'd. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> they go along they &s;ing certain Prayers to their God, pronouncing &s;everal times the words <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> while another going before the Bier, &s;ounds a little Bell, to advertize the living to pray for the dead. The Body being &s;et down by the bank of the River or Pond, they fir&s;t plunge it into the water, and then they burn it. According to the qua|lity of the deceas'd they al&s;o mingle with the ordinary wood Sandal-wood, and
<PB N="169" REF="248" MS="y">
other Sweet-woods. But the Idolaters do not only burn the Bodies of the dead, but the Bodies of the living. They &s;cruple to kill a &s;erpent, or a lou&s;e, but ac|count it a meritorious thing to burn a living Wife with the body of the deceas'd Husband.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Wives are burnt in <HI>India</HI> with the Bodies of their deceas'd Husbands.</HEAD>
<P>IT is al&s;o an ancient cu&s;tom among the <HI>Indians,</HI> that the Husband happening todye, the Wife can never marry again. So that as &s;oon as the Man is dead, the Wife retires to bewail her Husband; &s;ome days after that, they &s;have off her hair; &s;he lays a&s;ide all the ornaments of her apparel; &s;he takes off from her arms and legs the Bracelets which her Husband put on when he e&s;pous'd her, in token of her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and her being chain'd to him: and all the re&s;t of her life &s;he lives &s;lighted and di&s;pis'd, and in a wor&s;e condition than a Slave in the very Hou&s;e where &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s before. This unfortunate condition cau&s;es them to hate life, &s;o that they rather choo&s;e to be buri'd alive with the body of their deceas'd Husbands, then to live in the &s;corn and contempt of the World. Be&s;ides that, the <HI>Bramins</HI> make them believe, that in dying after that manner, they &s;hall re|vive again with him in another World, with more honour and more advantages than they enjoy'd before. The&s;e are the motives that per&s;wade the Woman to burn with their Husbands; be&s;ides that, the Prie&s;ts flatter them with a hope, that while they are in the mid&s;t of the flames, before they expire, <HI>Ram</HI> will appear, and reveal wonderful vi&s;ions to them; and that after their Souls have tran&s;migrated into various Bodies, they &s;hall at length obtain a high degree of Honour to eternity.</P>
<P>However, there is no Woman that can burn her Husband's body, till &s;he has the leave of the Governor of the place where &s;he inhabits, who be ing a <HI>Ma|h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">metan,</HI> and abhorring that execrable cu&s;tom of Self-murder, is very &s;hy to per|mit them. Be&s;ides, there are none but Widows that have no children, that lye under the reproach that forces them to violent death. For as for the Widows that have children, they are by no means permitted to burn them&s;elves; but quite the contrary, they are commanded to live for the education of the chil|dren. Tho&s;e Woman whom the Governour will not permit to burn them&s;elves, &s;pend the re&s;t of thir lives in doing Penance, and performing works of Charity. Some make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;it upon the Road to boyl certain Pul&s;e in water, and to give the liquor to Travellers to drink. Others &s;it with fire always ready for them to light their Tobacco. Others make vows to eat nothing but the un|dige&s;ted grains which they find in Cow-dung.</P>
<P>The Governour finding no per&s;wa&s;ions will alter the Woman's re&s;olution, but more e&s;pecially perceiving by the &s;ign which his Secretary makes him, that he had receiv'd the Coin, in a &s;urly manner gives the Woman leave, bidding the Devil take her and all her kindred.</P>
<P>When they have got this leave, their Mu&s;ick begins to &s;trike up, and away they ding to the Hou&s;e of the deceas'd, with Drums beating, and Flutes playing before them; and in that manner they accompany the per&s;on that is to be burnt, to the place appointed. All the kindred and friends of the Widow that is to dye, come to her, and congratulate her for the happine&s;s &s;he is to enjoy in the other World: and for the honour which the <HI>Ca&s;te</HI> &s;he is of receives by her generous re&s;olution, &s;he dre&s;&s;es her &s;elf as &s;he were going to be marri'd, and &s;he is conducted in tri|umph to the place of execution. For the noi&s;e is loud of Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and Womens Voices, that follow her &s;inging Songs in honour of the mi&s;erable creature that is going to dye. The <HI>Bramins</HI> that accompany her, exhort her to give publick te&s;timonies of her con&s;tancy and courage: and many of our <HI>Europeans</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="249">
are of opinion, that to take away the fears of death, which naturally terrifies hu|manity, the Prie&s;ts do give her a certain Beverage to &s;tupify and di&s;order the &s;en&s;es, which takes from her all apprehen&s;ion of her preparations for death. 'Tis for the <HI>Bramins</HI> intere&s;t that the poor mi&s;erable creatures &s;hould continue in their re&s;olutions; for all their Bracelets as well about their legs as their arms, the Pen|dents in their ears; their Rings &s;ometimes of Gold, &s;ometimes of Silver; (for the poor wear only Copper and Tin,) all the&s;e belong to the <HI>Bramins,</HI> who rake for them among the A&s;hes when the party is burn'd.</P>
<P>I have &s;een Women burnt after three &s;everal manners, according to the diffe|rence of the Countrey. In the Kingdom of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> as far as <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> they &s;et up a little Hut above twelve foot &s;quare upon the bank of a Pond or River. 'Tis made of Reeds, and all &s;orts of &s;mall Wood, with which they min|gle certain pots of Oil and other Drugs to make it burn more vehemently. The Woman is plac'd in the middle of the Hut, in a half-lying-down po&s;ture, leaning her head upon a kind of a wooden Bol&s;ter, and re&s;ting her back again&s;t a Pillar, to which the <HI>Bramin</HI> tyes her about the middle, for fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;hould run away when &s;he feels the fire. In this po&s;ture &s;he holds the body of her deceas'd Hu&s;|band upon her knees, chewing <HI>Betl&eacute;</HI> all the while: and when &s;he has continu'd in this po&s;ture about half an hour, the <HI>Bramin</HI> goes out, and the woman bids them &s;et fire to the Hut; which is immediately done by the <HI>Bramins,</HI> and the kindred and friends of the Woman; who al&s;o ca&s;t &s;everal pots of Oil into the fire, to put the Woman the &s;ooner out of her pain. After the Woman is burnt, the <HI>Bramins</HI> &s;earch the A&s;hes for all her Bracelets, Pendants and Rings, whether Gold, Silver, Copper or Tin, which is all free booty to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bengala</HI> they burn the Woman after another fa&s;hion. In that Country a Woman mu&s;t be very poor that does not accompany the Body of her deceas'd Husband to the <HI>Ganges</HI> to wa&s;h his Body, and to be wa&s;h'd her &s;elf before &s;he is burnt. I have &s;een dead Carka&s;&s;es brought to the <HI>Ganges</HI> above twenty days journey off from the place, and &s;melt 'em to boot; for the &s;cent of them has been intollerably noy&s;om. There was one that came from the Northern Moun|tains neer the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan,</HI> with the body of her Hu&s;|band carri'd in a Waggon; &s;he travel'd twenty days a-foot, and neither eat nor drank for 15 or 16 days together till &s;he came to the <HI>Ganges,</HI> where after &s;he had wa&s;h'd the body that &s;tank abominably, and had afterwards wa&s;h'd her &s;elf, &s;he was burnt with him with an admirable con&s;tancy. Before the Woman that is to be burnt, goes the Mu&s;ick, con&s;i&s;ting of Drums, Flutes and Hautboys, whom the Woman in her be&s;t Accoutrements follows, dancing up to the very Funeral-pile, upon which &s;he gets up, and places her &s;elf as if &s;he were &s;itting up in her Bed; and then they lay a-cro&s;s her the body of her Husband. When that is done, her kindred and friends, &s;ome bring her a Letter, &s;ome a piece of Calicut, another pieces of Silver or Copper, and de&s;ire her to deliver them to their Mother, or Brother, or &s;ome other Kin&s;man or Friend. When the woman &s;ees they have all done, &s;he asks the Standers-by three times, if they have nothing more of &s;er|vice to command her; if they make no an&s;wer, &s;he ties up all &s;he has got in a piece of Taffata, which &s;he puts between her own belly, and the body of her Husband, bidding them to &s;et fire to the Pile; which is pre&s;ently done by the <HI>Bramins</HI> and her Kindred. I have ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e there is &s;carcity of Wood in <HI>Bengala,</HI> that when the&s;e poor Creatures are half griddl'd, they ca&s;t their bodies into the <HI>Ganges,</HI> where the remains are devour'd by the Crocodiles.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget a wicked cu&s;tom practis'd by the Idolaters of <HI>Bengala.</HI> When a Woman is brought to bed, and the Child will not take to the Teat, they carry it out of the Village, and putting it into a Linnen Cloath, which they fa&s;t'n by the four Corners to the Boughs of a Tree, they there leave it from morning till evening. By this means the poor Infant is expos'd to be tormented by the Crows, in&s;omuch that there are &s;ome who have their eyes pickt out of their heads: which is the rea&s;on that in <HI>Bengala</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee many of the&s;e Ido|laters that have but one eye, and &s;ome that have lo&s;t both. In the evening they fetch the child away, to try whether he will &s;uck the next night; and if he &s;till refu&s;e the teat, they carry him again to the &s;ame place next morning; which they do for three days together; after which, if the Infant after that refu&s;es to &s;uck, they
<PB N="171" REF="249">
believe him to be a Devil, and throw him into <HI>Ganges,</HI> or any the next Pond or River. In the places where the Apes breed, the&s;e poor Infants are not &s;o expos'd to the Crows; for where the Ape di&s;covers a Ne&s;t of tho&s;e Birds, he climbs the Tree, and throws the Ne&s;t one way and the Eggs another. Some|times &s;ome charitable people among the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> com|pa&s;&s;ionating the misfortune of tho&s;e Children, will take them away from the Tree, and give them good education.</P>
<P>All along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> when the Woman are to be burnt with their Husbands, they make a great hole in the ground nine or ten foot deep, and twenty-five or thirty foot &s;quare, into which they throw a great quantity of Wood and Drugs to make the fire burn more fiercely. When the fire is kindled, they &s;et the body of the man upon the brink; and then pre&s;ently up comes the Woman dancing and chewing <HI>Betl&eacute;;</HI> accompany'd by her Friends and Kindred, with Drums beating, and Flutes &s;ounding. Then the Woman takes three turns round the hole, and every time &s;he has gone the round, &s;he ki&s;&s;es her Friends and Kindred. After the third time the <HI>Bramins</HI> ca&s;ts the Carca&s;s of her Husband into the flame; and the woman &s;tanding with her back to the fire, is pu&s;ht in by the <HI>Bramins</HI> al&s;o, and tumbles backward. Then her Kindred and Friends ca&s;t Oil and other combu&s;tile Drugs upon the fire, to make it burn more vehemently, that the Bodies may be the &s;ooner con|&s;um'd.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t places upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> the Women are not burnt with their deceas'd Husbands, but they are buried alive with them in holes which the <HI>Bramins</HI> make a foot deeper than the tallne&s;s of the man and wo|man. U&s;ually they chu&s;e a Sandy place; &s;o that when the man and woman are both let down together, all the Company with Baskets of Sand fill up the hole above half a foot higher than the &s;urface of the ground, after which they jump and dance upon it, till they believe the woman to be &s;tifl'd.</P>
<P>When &s;ome of the Idolaters upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel</HI> are upon the point of death, their Friends do not carry them to the &s;ide of a River or Lake to clean&s;e their Souls, but they carry them to the fatte&s;t Cow they can find; and laying the &s;ick party ju&s;t behind the Cow, they lift up her Tail, and pro|voke her to pi&s;s. If &s;he pi&s;s, &s;o that it falls upon the face of the &s;ick party, all the Company are overjoy'd, &s;aying, that his Soul is happy. But if the Cow do not pi&s;s, to wa&s;h the &s;ick parties face, they burn him with a great deal of &s;adne&s;s. If a Cow be &s;ick, the owner mu&s;t be careful to lead her to a Pond or River; for &s;hould &s;he dye at his Hou&s;e, the <HI>Bramins</HI> would fine him.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velou</HI> having lo&s;t his City and his life, through the lo&s;s of a Battel gain'd again&s;t him by the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI>'s General, he was extreamly lamented at Court. Eleven of his Wives al&s;o were no le&s;s concern'd for his death, and re&s;olv'd to be burnt when his Body was burn'd.

He who had the order, going to put it in execution, the Women in a rage told him, that 'twas to no purpo&s;e to keep them Pri&s;oners, for if they might not have leave to do what they had re&s;olv'd, in three hours there would not one of them be alive. The per&s;on entru&s;ted, laugh'd at their threats; but the Keeper of tho&s;e women opening the door at the end of the three hours, found them
<PB N="172" REF="250">
all &s;tretch'd out dead upon the place, without any mark in the world to be &s;een that they had any way ha&s;ten'd their own deaths.</P>
<P>Two of the mo&s;t potent <HI>Raja's</HI> of <HI>India</HI> came to <HI>Agra</HI> in the year 1642, to do homage to <HI>Sha-jehan,</HI> who then reign'd; who not having acquitted them|&s;elves as they ought to have done, in the judgment of the Grand-Ma&s;ter of the Kings Hou&s;hold, he told one of the <HI>Raja's</HI> one day, in the pre&s;ence of the King, that they had not done well, to behave them&s;elves in that manner toward &s;o great a Monarch, as was the King his Ma&s;ter. The <HI>Raja</HI> looking upon him&s;elf to be a great King, and a great Prince, he and his Brother having brought along with them a Train of 15 or 16000 thou&s;and Hor&s;e, was netl'd at the bold reproof which the Grand Ma&s;ter gave him, and drawing out his Dagger, &s;lew him upon the place, in the pre&s;ence of the King. The Grand Ma&s;ter falling at the feet of his own Brother, who &s;tood clo&s;e by him, he was going about to re|venge his death, but was prevented by the <HI>Raja's</HI> Brother, who &s;tab'd him, and laid him athwart his Brothers Body. The King, who beheld the&s;e two murthers one upon the neck of the other, retir'd into his <HI>Haram</HI> for fear. But pre&s;ently the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and other people fell upon the <HI>Raja's,</HI> and cut 'em to pieces. The King incens'd at &s;uch an attempt committed in his Hou&s;e and in his pre&s;ence, commanded the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s bodies to be thrown into the River; which their Troops that they had left about <HI>Agra</HI> under&s;tanding, threaten'd to enter the City and pillage it. But rather than hazard the City, the King was advis'd to deliver them the Bodies of their Princes. When they were to be burn'd, thirteen Women belonging to the two <HI>Raja's</HI> Hou&s;es, came dancing and leaping, and pre&s;ently got upon the Funeral pile, holding one another by the hands, and being pre&s;ently after &s;tifl'd with the &s;moak, fell together into the fire. Pre&s;ently the <HI>Bramins</HI> threw great heaps of Wood, pots of Oil, and other combu&s;tible matter upon them, to di&s;patch them the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved a &s;trange pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Patna,</HI> being then with the Governour, a young Gentleman of about twenty-four years of age, in his own Hou&s;e. While I was with him, in came a young woman, very hand&s;ome, and not above two and twenty years old, who de&s;ir'd leave of the Governour to be burnt with the Body of her deceas'd Husband. The Governour compa&s;&s;ionating her youth and beauty, endeavour'd to divert her from her re&s;olution; but finding he could not prevail, with a &s;urly countenance, he ask'd her whether &s;he under&s;tood what the torment of fire was, and whether &s;he had ever burnt her fingers? No, no, an&s;wer'd &s;he more &s;toutly than before, I do not fear fire, and to let you know as much, &s;end for a lighted Torch, hither. The Governour abominating her an&s;wer, in great pa&s;&s;ion bid her go to the Devil. Some young Lords that were with the Governour, de&s;ir'd him to try the Woman, and to call for a Torch; which with much ado he did, and a lighted Torch was brought. So &s;oon as the woman &s;aw the lighted Torch coming, &s;he ran to meet it, and held her hand in the flame, not altering her countenance in the lea&s;t; &s;till &s;earing her arm along up to the very elbow, till her fle&s;h look'd as if it had been broil'd; whereupon the Governour commanded her out of his &s;ight.</P>
<P>A <HI>Bramin</HI> coming to <HI>Patna,</HI> and a&s;&s;embling all his Tribe together, told them, that they mu&s;t give him two thou&s;and Roupies, and twenty-&s;even Ells of Cali|cut. To which the chief among them made him an&s;wer, that they were poor, and could not po&s;&s;ible rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;um. However he per&s;i&s;ted in his demand, po|&s;itively affirming to them, that he would &s;tay there without eating or drink|ing till they brought him the Money and the Cloath. With this re&s;olution he climb'd a Tree, and &s;etting in the fork between the boughs, remain'd there without eating or drinking for &s;everal days. The noi&s;e of this extrava|gance coming to the ears of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> where we lay, we &s;et Sentinels to watch whether it were true, that a man could &s;it &s;o long without victu|als, which he did for thirty days together. The one and thirtieth day of &s;uch an extraordinary Fa&s;t, the Idolaters fearing to kill one of their Prie&s;ts for want of granting him his demand, club'd together, and brought him his twenty-&s;even Ells of Calicut, and two thou&s;and Roupies. So &s;oon as the <HI>Bramin</HI> &s;aw the Money and the Cloath, he came down from the Tree; and after he had upbraided tho&s;e of his Tribe for want of Charity, he di&s;tributed all the Roupies
<PB N="173" REF="250">
among the poor, re&s;erving only five or &s;ix for him&s;elf. The Cloth he cut into little pieces, and gave away, keeping only to him&s;elf enough to cover his own makedne&s;s; and having made this di&s;tribution, he di&s;appear'd of a &s;uddeh, and no body knew what became of him, though dilligent &s;earch was made after him.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> lies at the point of death, all his Kindred and Friends gather about him, and ask him whither he intends to go; they tell him al&s;o, that if he want any thing, he need but only ask and have, let it be Gold, Silver, or a Woman. When they are dead they perform many Ceremonies at their Funerals, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in artificial fires, wherein the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are the mo&s;t expert in the world; &s;o that he mu&s;t be a very poor man that has no fire-works at his Funeral. Be&s;ides that, they put Money in a little Box, and bury it by the deceas'd; and leave good &s;tore of victuals upon the Grave, out of an opinion that they ri&s;e and eat. Which the Souldiers of <HI>Batavia</HI> ob&s;erving, us'd to fill their Bellies at the&s;e Graves every time they walk'd their rounds. But when the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> perceiv'd it, they poy&s;on'd the victuals to &s;poil the <HI>Dutchmens</HI> fea&s;t|ing. The Townsmen of <HI>Batavia</HI> taking the Souldiers part, accus'd the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> for poy&s;oning &s;everal of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> pleaded, that if the Sol|diers had over-eat them&s;elves, or &s;urfeited them&s;elves upon what was left for the dead to eat, 'twas none of their fault; for that they did not leave their victuals for the Souldiers; and be&s;ides that, among all the multitudes which they had bu|ried, they never had heard the lea&s;t complaint before of any one that ever came by any harm by eating their food. Thus the bu&s;ine&s;s was hu&s;h'd over; nor did the Souldiers dare to pilfer any more.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Pagods</HI> of the Idolaters in <HI>India.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Indian</HI> Idolaters have a great number of Temples, &s;mall and great which they call <HI>Pagods,</HI> where they pray to their Gods, and make their Offerings. But the poor people that live in the Woods and Mountains, and re|mote from Towns, are contented only with &s;ome &s;tone, whereon they make a rude kind of No&s;e, and paint it with &s;ome Vermillion colour, which &s;erves all the whole neighbourhood to wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The four mo&s;t celebrated Pagods, are <HI>Jagrenate, Banarous, Matura,</HI> and <HI>Tri|peti.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jagrenate</HI> is one of the mouths of <HI>Ganges,</HI> whereupon is built the Great Pa|god, where the <HI>Arch Bramin,</HI> or chief Prie&s;t among the Idolaters keeps his re&s;idence. The great Idol that &s;tands upon the Altar in the innermo&s;t part of the Pagod, has two Diamonds for his Eyes, and another that hangs about his neck, the lea&s;t of tho&s;e Diamonds weighing about forty Carats. About his Arms he wears Bracelets &s;ometimes of Pearls, and &s;ometimes of Rubies; and this magnificent Idol is call'd <HI>Re&s;ora.</HI> The Revenues of this Pagod are &s;uffi|cient to &s;eed fifteen or twenty thou&s;and Pilgrims every day; which is a num|ber often &s;een there, that Pagod being the greate&s;t place of devotion in all <HI>In|dia.</HI> But you mu&s;t take notice, that no Gold&s;mith is &s;uffer'd to enter this Pagod, becau&s;e that one of them being lock'd in all night long, &s;tole a Diamond out of one of the Idols eyes. As he was about to go out, when the Pagod was open'd in the morning, he dy'd at the door; their God, as they affirm, re|venging his own &s;acriledg. That which renders this Pagod, which is a large build|ing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all <HI>India,</HI> is, becau&s;e it is &s;ituated upon the <HI>Gan|ges;</HI> the Idolaters believing that the waters of that River have a particular quality to clean&s;e them from their &s;ins. That which makes it &s;o rich (for it maintains above twenty thou&s;and Cows) is the va&s;t Alms that are continually be&s;tow'd by &s;o incredible a multitude as comes from all parts. Which Alms are not &s;o much as at the di&s;cretion of the Donor, at the Will of the chief
<PB N="174" REF="251">
Prie&s;t, who before he gives them leave to &s;have and wa&s;h in <HI>Ganges,</HI> taxes them according to their quality, of which he has information. Thus he col|lects va&s;ts &s;ums, of which he makes little or no profit him&s;elf; all going to feed the poor, and the repair of the Pagod. The chief <HI>Bramin</HI> cau&s;es Victuals to be di&s;tributed to the Pilgrims every day; as Milk, Rice, Butter and Wheat; but to the poor, who want wherewithall to coo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, they di&s;tribute their food ready dre&s;st. In the morning they boil a quantity of Rice in Earth'n pots of different bigne&s;s; and at the hour when the Pilgrims come for their meat, the chief <HI>Bramin</HI> orders another <HI>Bramin</HI> to take a pot&punc; of boil'd Rice; this pot he lets fall; and if there be five, the pot breaks into five equal parts, and eve|ry one takes his own &s;hare. And in the &s;ame manner he breaks it into more pieces, if there be more per&s;ons, to whom he is to di&s;tribute the food. Which is a thing very &s;trange and worthy ob&s;ervation. They never boil twice in an Earthen pot; but in a Copper pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; nor have they any other Di&s;hes, than only certain Leaves, which they fa&s;ten together, and a certain kind of a Ba&s;on, a|bout a foot in compa&s;s, wherein they melt their Butter, and &s;tir the Rice with the ends of their fingers when they eat. They have al&s;o a kind of a Shell, wherein they pour their melted Butter, which they will &s;wallow down, as we do Sack.</P>
<P>Now for the de&s;cription of a particular Idol which &s;tands upon the Altar in the Pagod of <HI>Jagrenate:</HI> It is cover'd from the Shoulders downward with a great Mantle that hangs down upon the Altar. This Mantle is of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold or Silver, according to the Solemnities. At fir&s;t it had neither feet nor hands; but after one of their Phropets was taken up into Heaven, while they were lamenting what to do for another, God &s;ent them an Angel in the like|ne&s;s of that Prophet, to the end they might continue their Veneration toward him. Now while this Angel was bu&s;ie in making this Idol, the people grew &s;o impatient, that they took him out of the Angels hands, and put him into the Pagod, without hands or feet; but finding that the Idol appear'd in that manner too deform'd, they made him hands and arms of tho&s;e &s;mall Pearls which we call Ounce-Pearls. As for his feet, they are never &s;een, being hid un|der his Cloak. There is no part op'n but his hands and feet; the head and body being of Sandal-wood; round about the <HI>Dnomo,</HI> under which this Idol &s;tands, being very high, from the bottom to the top, are only Niches fill'd with other Idols; the greate&s;t part whereof repre&s;ent mo&s;t hideous Mon&s;ters, being all of different colours. On each &s;ide of this Pagod, there &s;tands ano|ther much le&s;s, where the Pilgrims make their le&s;&s;er Offerings. And &s;ome that have in &s;ickne&s;s, or upon bu&s;ine&s;s made any Vows to any Deity, bring thi|ther the re&s;emblance thereof in remembrance of the good which they have re|ceiv'd. They rub this Idol every day with &s;weet Oils, that make it of a black colour. And at the right hand of this Idol &s;its his Si&s;ter, who &s;tands upon her feet, and is well clad, being call'd by the name <HI>Sotora;</HI> upon his left, &s;tands his Brother, cloath'd all over al&s;o, whom they call <HI>Balhadar.</HI> Before the Idol, &s;omewhat toward his le&s;t hand, &s;tands the Idols Wife upon her feet, all of ma&s;&s;y Gold, by the name of <HI>Remin;</HI> whereas the other three, are only of Sandal|wood.</P>
<P>The other two Pagods are appointed for the re&s;idence of the chief <HI>Bramin,</HI> and other <HI>Bramins</HI> that officiate in the great Pagod. All the&s;e <HI>Bramins</HI> go with their heads bare, and for the mo&s;t part &s;hav'd; having no other Cloathes but only one piece of Calicut, with one half whereof they cover their bodies; the other part &s;erves them in&s;tead of a Scarf. Neer the Pagod &s;tands the Tomb of one of their Prophets, who&s;e name was <HI>Cabir,</HI> to whom they give great honour. You are to take notice al&s;o, that their Idols &s;tand upon a kind of Altar encompa&s;s'd with Iron Bars. For no per&s;ons are to touch them, but only certain <HI>Bramins,</HI> appointed for that &s;ervice by the chief <HI>Bramin.</HI></P>
<P>Next to that of <HI>Jagrenate,</HI> the mo&s;t famous Pagod is that of <HI>Banurous,</HI> be|ing al&s;o feated upon the <HI>Ganges,</HI> in a City that bears the &s;ame name. That which is mo&s;t remarkable is, that from the Gate of the Pagod to the River there is a de&s;cent all of Stone; neer to which are certain Platforms, and &s;mall blind Chambers, &s;ome of the <HI>Bramins</HI> lodging, others where they dre&s;s th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="175" REF="251">
victuals; for &s;o &s;oon as the Idolaters have &s;aid their Prayers, and made their Of|ferings, they dre&s;s their food, not &s;uffering any per&s;on to touch it but them&s;elves, for fear le&s;t any unclean per&s;on &s;hould come neer it. But above all things, they pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire to drink of <HI>Ganges</HI> water; for as often as they drink it, they are wa&s;h'd, as they believe, from all their &s;ins. Great numbers of the&s;e <HI>Bramins</HI> go every day to the cleane&s;t part of the River, where they fill their little round earthen-pots full of water, the mouths whereof are very &s;mall, and contain every one of them a Bucket-full. Being thus fill'd they bring them before the great Prie&s;t, who covers them with a fine piece of flame-colour'd Calicut, three or four times doubl'd, to which he &s;ets his Seal. The <HI>Bramins</HI> carry the&s;e pots, &s;ome &s;ix of them ty'd together with &s;ix little cords fa&s;ten'd to the end of a &s;tick as broad as a lath, &s;hifting their &s;houlders often; travelling &s;ometimes three or four hunder'd leagues with tho&s;e precious burthens up into the Countrey. Where they &s;ell it, or pre&s;ent it; but that is only to the rich, from whence they expect great rewards. There are &s;ome of the Idolaters, who when they make any great Fea&s;t, e&s;pecially when they marry their children, will drink four or five hunder'd Crowns in this water. They never drink of it till the end of their meals; and then a gla&s;s or two according to the liberality of the Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t. The chief rea&s;on why they e&s;teem the water of <HI>Ganges</HI> &s;o highly, is, becau&s;e it never putrifies, nor engenders any Vermin; though I know not whether they may be believ'd, con&s;idering the great quantity of dead bodies which they fling into the <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>The body of the Pagod of <HI>Banarous</HI> is made like a Cro&s;s, as are all the re&s;t of the Pagods, the four parts whereof are equal. In the mid&s;t there is a <HI>Cupola</HI> rais'd very high, the top whereof is pyramidal; at the end al&s;o of every four parts of the Cro&s;s there is a Tower, to which there is an a&s;cent on the out-&s;ide. Before you come to the top, there are &s;everal Balconies and Niches wherein to take the fre&s;h air: and round about are figures of all &s;orts of creatures, but very Lend work. Under the <HI>Duomo,</HI> in the middle of the Pagod there is an Altar, like a Table, eight foot long, and &s;ix foot broad, with two &s;teps before, that &s;erve for a foot&s;tool, which is cover'd &s;ometimes with a rich Tape&s;try, &s;ometimes with Silk, &s;ometimes with Cloath of Gold or Silver, according to the &s;olemnity of their Fe&s;tival. Their Altars are cover'd with Cloath of Gold or Silver, or el&s;e with &s;ome painted Calicuts. Approaching the entry of the Pagod, you &s;ee the Altar right before ye, together with the Idols which are upon it. For the Wo|men and Virgins wor&s;hip without, not being permitted to enter the Pagod, no more than is a certain Tribe which is among them. Among the Idols that &s;tand upon the great Altar, there is one plac'd upright &s;ome five or &s;ix foot high; but you can &s;ee neither arms, nor legs, nor body: nothing appears but the head and neck, all the re&s;t being cover'd down to the Altar with a Robe that &s;preads it &s;elf below. Sometimes you &s;hall &s;ee the neck &s;et out with &s;ome rich Chain either of Gold, Rubies, Pearls or Emraulds. This Idol was made in honour and likene&s;s of <HI>Bainma-don,</HI> who was heretofore a very great and holy Per&s;onage among them, who&s;e name they oft'n have in their mouths. Upon the right-&s;ide of the Altar &s;tands the figure of a <HI>Chimera,</HI> part Elephant, part Hor&s;e, part Mule. It is of ma&s;&s;ive Gold, and they call it <HI>Garou,</HI> not &s;uffering any per&s;on to approach it but the <HI>Bramins.</HI> They &s;ay it is the re&s;emblance of the Bea&s;t which carri'd that holy per&s;on when he liv'd upon earth. And that he travell'd long journeys upon his back, to &s;ee if the people remain'd in their duty, and whether they did no wrong one to another. Between the great Gate and the great Altar upon the left-hand, there is a little Altar, upon which there &s;tands an Idol of black Marble &s;itting cro&s;s|legg'd, about two foot high. While I was there, a little Boy who was the Son of the High-Prie&s;t &s;tood upon the left-&s;ide of the Altar, and all the people threw him certain pieces of Taffata, or imbroider'd Calicut, like Handkerchiefs, all which he return'd to the people again after he had wip'd them upon the Idol. Others threw him Bracelets of Coral, others of yellow-Amber, others threw him fruits and flowers; whatever they threw him, he rubb'd it upon the Idol, put it to his lips, and then re&s;tor'd it to the people. This Idol is call'd <HI>Morli-Ram,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>God&punc; Morli,</HI> and was the Brother of him that &s;tands upon the great Al|tar.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="252">
Under the Portal of the Pagod &s;its one of the principal <HI>Bramins</HI> with a great Ba&s;on by him, full of a yellow colour mix'd with water. All the&s;e poor Idola|ters come and pre&s;ent them&s;elves before him, who gives them a mark from be|tween the eyes to the top of the no&s;e, then upon the arms, and upon the &s;tomach; by which marks they know who have wa&s;h'd them&s;elves in <HI>Ganges,</HI> and who not. Tho&s;e that never wa&s;h'd them&s;elves but in the waters of their own Wells, or have only &s;ent for it from the River, they do not belive to be perfectly purifi'd, and by con&s;equence they are not to be mark'd with that colour. By the way take notice, that the&s;e Idolaters are mark'd with different colours, according to the Tribe they are of. But in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> they who are painted with yellow compo&s;e the bigge&s;t Tribe, and are the lea&s;t defil'd. For when they are nece&s;&s;itated to the deeds of nature, &s;ome think it enough to wa&s;h the part defil'd; but they fir&s;t rub the part with a handful of &s;and, then they &s;cour it with water. After &s;o doing, they affirm their bodies to be clean, and that they can eat their food without fear.</P>
<P>Neer to this great Pagod upon the Summer-We&s;t, &s;tands a kind of a Colledg, which the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eing,</HI> the mo&s;t potent of all the Idolaters in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Em|pire, built for the education of the youth of the better &s;ort. I &s;aw two of the children of that Prince there at School, who had for their Ma&s;ters &s;everal <HI>Bra|mins,</HI> who trught them to write and read in a language peculiar to the Idolaters Prie&s;ts, and far different from the &s;peech of the common people. Entring into the Court of that Colledg, and ca&s;ting my eyes up, I di&s;cover'd two Galleries that went round the Court, where I &s;aw the two Princes &s;itting, attended by &s;everal petty Lords and <HI>Bramins,</HI> who made &s;everal Mathematical Figures upon the ground with chalk. The two Princes &s;eeing me, &s;ent to know who I was; and under&s;tanding that I was a <HI>Frank,</HI> they &s;ent for me up, and ask'd me &s;everal que&s;tions touching <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly touching <HI>France.</HI> Whereupon there being two Globes in the room which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had giv'n the <HI>Bramins,</HI> I &s;hew'd the Princes where <HI>France</HI> lay upon one of them. After I had taken leave, I ask'd one of the <HI>Bramins</HI> when I might &s;ee the Pagod open: he an&s;wer'd me, the next morning before Sun-ri&s;ing. When I came there, I ob&s;erv'd before the door, a Gallery &s;upported with Pillars, where there was already a great crowd of men, women and children expecting when the Pagod would be open'd. By and by, the Gallery, and a great part of the Court being full, there came eight <HI>Bra|mins,</HI> four of each &s;ide of the Gate, with every one a Cen&s;er in his hand, follow'd by a rabble of other <HI>Bramins</HI> that made a hideous noi&s;e with Drums and other In|&s;truments. The two elde&s;t of the <HI>Bramins</HI> &s;ing a Song; and then all the people falling into the tune, fall a &s;inging and playing, with every one a Peacock's-tail, or &s;ome other kind of flable, to drive away the flies, that the Idol may not be an|noid when they op'n the Pagod. This fanning, and the Mu&s;ick, la&s;ted a good half hour. Then the two principal <HI>Bramins</HI> made a great noi&s;e three times with two little Bells, and with a kind of a Mallet knockt at the Pagod-door. Which was pre&s;ently open'd by &s;ix <HI>Bramins</HI> within, di&s;covering, &s;ome &s;ix or &s;even paces from the entrance, an Alter with an Idol upon it, which they call <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> the Si&s;ter of <HI>Morli-Ram.</HI> Upon her right-hand &s;he has a child made like a great <HI>Cu|pid,</HI> which they call the God <HI>La-Kemin,</HI> and in her left-arm a little Girl, which they call the Godde&s;s <HI>Sita.</HI> So &s;oon as the Pagod was open, and that a great Cur|tain was drawn, the people, who perceiv'd the Idol, fell upon the ground, laying their hands upon their heads, and pro&s;trating them&s;elves three times. Then ri&s;ing up, they threw great quantities of No&s;egays and Garlands to the Prie&s;ts; with which the <HI>Bramins</HI> touch'd the Idol, and then re&s;tor'd them again. Before the Alter &s;tood a <HI>Bramin,</HI> who held in his hand a lamp of nine wieks lighted&punc; upon which he ca&s;t Incen&s;e every foot, land then held it to the Idol. All the&s;e ceremonies la&s;ted above an hour; after which the people departed, and the Pagod was &s;hut. They pre|&s;ented the Idol with great &s;tore of Rice, Meal, Butter, Oil, and Milk-meats, of which the <HI>Bramins</HI> lo&s;e nothing. Now in regard this Idol is the repre&s;entation of a Woman, the Women all invoke it, and call her their Patrone&s;s: which is the rea&s;on that the place is generally crowded with Women and Maids. The <HI>Raja,</HI> to have this Idol in the Pagod of his own hou&s;e, and for taking it out of the great Pagod, has expended as well upon the <HI>Bramins,</HI> as in alms to the poor, above five Lacres of Roupies, or 750000 Livres of our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="252">
On the other &s;ide of the Street where the Colledg is built, there &s;tands another Pagod, call'd <HI>Richourdas,</HI> from the name of the Idol, which is within upon the Al|tar: and &s;omewhat lower upon another &s;mall Altar &s;tands another Idol, which they call <HI>Goupaidas,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Richourdas.</HI> You &s;ee nothing but the face of all the&s;e Idols, which is either of wood or jet; unle&s;s it be the Idol of <HI>Morly-Ram,</HI> which &s;tands in the great Pagod &s;tark naked. As for the Idol <HI>Ram-Kam,</HI> which &s;tands in the Raja's Pagod, it has two Diamonds in&s;tead of eyes, which the Prince caus'd to be &s;et there, with a Coller of Pearl, and Canopy over his head, &s;up|ported with four Silver-Pillars.</P>
<P>Some eight days journey from <HI>Banarous,</HI> bending Northward, you enter into a Mountainous Countrey; but which &s;ometimes op'ns it &s;elf into very large plains, &s;ometimes three or four leagues in length. They are very fertil in Corn, Rice, Wheat, and Pul&s;e. But that which is the plague and ruine of the people of that Countrey, is the va&s;t number of Elephants that breed there, and devour their Harve&s;t. If a Caravan pa&s;s through any part of that Countrey where there are no Inns, in regard the people are forc'd to lye in the op'n Fields, they have much ado to defend them&s;elves from the Elephants that will come to take away their provi&s;ions. To skare them, the people make great fires, &s;hoot off their Mu&s;|kets, hooping and hollowing ever and anon. In this place there is another Pagod, well-built, and very ancient, adorn'd with many figures both within and without, which are only the repre&s;entations of Maids and Women; &s;o that Men are &s;eldom known to repair thither for devotion's-&s;ake; and therefore it is call'd the Wo|mens Pagod. There is an Altar in the middle, as in other Pagods; and upon the Altar an Idol of ma&s;&s;y Gold, four foot high, repre&s;enting a Maid &s;tanding upright, which they call <HI>Ram-Marion.</HI> At her right-hand &s;tands a Child of ma&s;&s;y Silver, about two foot high; and they &s;ay that the Maid liv'd a very holy life, that that Child was brought to her by the <HI>Bramins</HI> to he in&s;tructed in her belief, and in the knowledg of well-living: but that after two or three years that the Child had liv'd with her, the Infant grew &s;o knowing and ready witted, that all the <HI>Raja's</HI> of the Countrey long'd for her company; &s;o that being &s;toll'n from her one night, &s;he was never &s;een afterwards. Upon the left-hand of this Idol, &s;tands another Idol, repre&s;enting an old Man; who, as they &s;ay, was the &s;ervant of <HI>Ram-Marion</HI> and the Infant: for which rea&s;on the <HI>Bramins</HI> do very much reverence this Idol. They never come but once a year in devotion, but they mu&s;t be there upon a pre|fix'd day, which is the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> though they never op'n the Pagod till the full of the Moon. During tho&s;e fifteen days, the Pilgrims, as well Men as Women, fa&s;t from time to time, and wa&s;h them&s;elves three times a-day, not leaving a hair in any part of their bodies, which they take off with a certain earth.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Continuation of the de&s;cription of the principal Pagods of the <HI>Indian</HI> Idolaters.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the Pagods of <HI>Ingrenate</HI> and <HI>Banarous,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is that of <HI>Matura,</HI> about eighteen leagues from <HI>Agra,</HI> upon the way to <HI>Dehly.</HI> It is one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Edifices in all <HI>India,</HI> and the place to which the greate&s;t number of Pilgrims was wont to re&s;ort: But now there are very few or none; the Idolaters having &s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t the reverence which they had for that Pagod, &s;ince the River of <HI>Gemena,</HI> that formerly ran by that Pagod, has chang'd its cour&s;e, above half a league from it. For it requires &s;o much time to return to the Pagod, after they have wa&s;h'd in the River, that they were many times defil'd again before they could reach it. Though this Pagod &s;tand in a bottom, yet you may di&s;cover it five or &s;ix leagues before you come at it, the building being very lofty and magnificent. The Stones are of a red colour,
<PB N="178" REF="253">
which they fetch from a Quarry, neer <HI>Agra.</HI> They cleave like our Slates, &s;ome of them being fifteen foot long, and nine or ten foot broad, yet not above &s;ix fingers thick, e&s;pecially when you cleave them as you would have them for u&s;e: They al&s;o make very fair Pillars. The Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra,</HI> the Walls of <HI>Jeba|nabat,</HI> the King's Hou&s;e, the two <HI>Mo&s;quees,</HI> and &s;everal Noblemens Hou&s;es are all built of this Stone.</P>
<P>The Pagod is built upon a great Platform of an <HI>Octogonal</HI> Figure, pav'd with Free-&s;tone; being adorn'd round about with the figures of all &s;orts of crea|tures, e&s;pecially Apes. There is an a&s;cent to it two wayes of fifteen or &s;ixteen &s;teps a-piece, every &s;tep being two foot broad, for two per&s;ons to go a-bre&s;t. One of the a&s;cents leads up to the great Portal of the Pagod, the other behind up to the Chancel. The Pagod does not take up above half the Platform, the other half &s;erving for a <HI>Piazza</HI> before it. The Structure is in the form of a Cro&s;s, like the re&s;t of the Pagods, in the mid&s;t whereof a great <HI>Duomo,</HI> with two others of each &s;ide &s;omewhat le&s;s, advance them&s;elves above the re&s;t of the building. The out-&s;ide of the building from top to bottom is adorn'd with the figures of Rams, Apes and Elephants, and &s;everal &s;orts of Mon|&s;ters. From one foot below every one of the&s;e <HI>Duomo's</HI> to the Roof, at &s;uch and &s;uch &s;paces, are Windows, &s;ome five, &s;ome &s;ix feet high, and to every Window, belongs a Balcone, where four per&s;ons may &s;tand. Every Bal|cone is cover'd with a little Arch, &s;upported by four Pillars, others by eight, every two touching one another. Round about the <HI>Duomo's</HI> are Niches fill'd with the figures of <HI>Daemons.</HI> Some with four arms, &s;ome with four legs. Some with mens heads upon the bodies of Bea&s;ts, and long tails that hang down to their thighes: There are abundance of Apes; and indeed it is an ugly &s;ight to behold &s;o many deform'd &s;pectacles. There is but one great door to the Pagod, upon each &s;ide whereof there are Pillars and Figures of Men and Mon&s;ters. The hinder-part is clos'd with a clo&s;e Bali&s;ter of Stone-Pillars five or &s;ix inches in Diameter, into which, as into a kind of <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> none but the <HI>Bramins</HI> are permitted to enter: but for Money, I got in, and &s;aw a &s;quare Altar &s;ome fifteen or &s;ixten foot from the door co|ver'd with an old Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver, upon which &s;tood the great Idol, which they call <HI>Ram, Ram.</HI> You &s;ee nothing but his head, which is of a very black Marble, with two Rubies in&s;tead of eyes. All the body, from the &s;houl|ders to the feet, is cover'd with a Robe of Purple-Velvet, with &s;ome &s;mall embroidery. There are two other Idols of each &s;ide of him two foot high, ap|parrell'd in the &s;ame manner; only their faces are white, which they call <HI>Bec|chor.</HI> There I &s;aw a Machine &s;ixteen foot &s;quare, and between twelve and fifteen foot high; cover'd with painted Calicuts, repre&s;enting the &s;hapes of De|vils. This Machine running upon four Wheels, they told me, was a moving Altar, upon which they carri'd their great God in Proce&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it the other Gods, as al&s;o to the River, whither all the people went upon their great Fe&s;ti|val.</P>
<P>The fourth Pagod is that of <HI>Tripeti,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> toward the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and <HI>Cape Comorin.</HI> I &s;aw it as I went to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan.</HI> It is a Pagod to which there belong a great number of little lodgings for the <HI>Bramins:</HI> &s;o that altogether it &s;eems to be a great Town. There are &s;everal Ponds round about it; but their &s;uper&s;tition is &s;o great, that no Pa&s;&s;enger dare take any water out of them, but what the <HI>Bramin</HI> gives him.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Pilgrimages of the Idolaters to their Pagods.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Idolaters under the Dominion of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and other Princes, both on this &s;ide and beyond <HI>Ganges,</HI> at lea&s;t once in their lives go in Pilgrimage to one of the&s;e Pagods that I have nam'd; but mo&s;t gene|rally to that of <HI>Ingrenate,</HI> as being the fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable above all the re&s;t. The <HI>Bramins</HI> and rich people go oftner. For &s;ome go every four years, &s;ome every &s;ix, or eight; and putting the Idols of their Pagods upon Pallekies cover'd with Ti&s;&s;ues, they travel with their <HI>Bramins,</HI> as it were in proce&s;&s;ion to the Pagod which they mo&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>They go not in Pilgrimage, one by one, or two and two, but whole Towns, and many times &s;everal Towns together. The poor that go a great way, are &s;upply'd by the rich; who &s;pend very freely in &s;uch acts of Charity. The rich travel in Pallekies or Chariots, the poor on foot, or upon Oxen; the Wife carrying the Child, and the man the Kitchin Implements.</P>
<P>The Idol which they carry in proce&s;&s;ion, by way of vi&s;it, and out of re&s;pect to the great <HI>Ram-Ram,</HI> lies at length in a rich Palleky, cover'd with Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver, fring'd as richly; the Mattre&s;s and Bol&s;ter being of the &s;ame &s;tuff under the head, feet, and elbows. The <HI>Bramins</HI> al&s;o di&s;tribute Fla|bels to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Company, the handles whereof being eight foot long, are plated with Gold and Silver. The Flabel being three foot in Dia|meter, of the &s;ame Ti&s;&s;ue as the Pallekies; round about, it is adorn'd with Peacocks Feathers to gather more wind, and &s;ometimes with Bells to make a kind of tingling. There are &s;ix of the&s;e Flabels u&s;ually employ'd to keep off the Flies from their God; the better &s;ort taking it by turns, that the honour of waiting upon their God may be more equally &s;har'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of divers Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Indian</HI> Idolaters.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Bramins</HI> are well skill'd in A&s;trology; and will exactly foretell to the peo|ple the Eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon. The &s;econd of <HI>July</HI> 1666, about one a Clock in the afternoon, at <HI>Patna</HI> in <HI>Bengala,</HI> there was an Eclip&s;e of the Sun; at which time it was a prodigious thing to &s;ee the multitudes of people, men, women, and children, that ran to the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> to wa&s;h them|&s;elves. But it behoves them to begin to wa&s;h three days before the Eclip&s;e; all which time they labour day and night in providing all &s;orts of Rice Milk, Meats, and Sweatmeats, to throw to the Fi&s;h and Crocodiles, as &s;oon as the <HI>Bramins</HI> give the word. Whatever Eclip&s;e it be whether of the Sun or Moon, the Idolaters as &s;oon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it appears, break all their Earthen Pots and Di&s;hes in the hou&s;e, which makes a hideous noi&s;e altogether.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Bramin</HI> has his Magick Book, wherein are abundance of Circles and Semicircles, Squares, Triangles, and &s;everal &s;orts of Cifers. They al&s;o make &s;everal Figures upon the ground, and when they find that the good hour is come, they cry aloud to the people to feed the fi&s;h. Then there en&s;ues a mo&s;t horrible Din of Drums, Bells, and great noi&s;e of &s;ounding Mettal, which they twang one again&s;t another. And as &s;oon as the victuals are thrown into the Ri|ver, the people are to go in and wa&s;h and rub them&s;elves till the Eclip&s;e be o|ver. So that in regard the waters were at that time very high, for more than three Leagues above and below the City, and all the breadth of the River, there
<PB N="180" REF="254">
was nothing to be &s;een but the heads of the people. As for the <HI>Bramins,</HI> they &s;tay a&s;hore to receive the richer &s;ort, and tho&s;e that give mo&s;t; to dry their bodies and to give them dry Linnen to their bellies. Afterwards they cau&s;e them to &s;it down in a Chair, where the mo&s;t liberal of the Idolaters have pro|vided Rice, Pulfe, Milk, Butter, Sugar, Meal, and Wood. Before the Chair the <HI>Bramin</HI> makes a place very clean about five foot &s;quare; then with Cow-dung &s;teep'd in a kind of yellow Ba&s;on, he rubs all the place, for fear any Emet &s;hould come there to be burnt. For indeed they would never make u&s;e of Wood if they could help it; and when they do, they are very careful that there be no Worms or In&s;ects in it. In the place which they have thus cleans'd, they draw &s;everal Figures, as Triangles, Ovals, Half-Ovals, &amp;c. Then upon every Figure they lay a little Cows-dung, with two or three &s;mall &s;ticks of Wood, upon every one of which they lay a &s;everal &s;ort of Grain; after that pouring Butter, and &s;etting fire to each; by the &s;moak which ri&s;es, they judg of the plenty of every &s;ort of Grain that year.</P>
<P>When the Moon is at the full in <HI>March,</HI> they keep a &s;olemn Fe&s;tival for their Idol, which is in form of a Serpent. This Fe&s;tival continues nine dayes; and when it comes, they do nothing but make Holiday all the while, as well men as bea&s;ts, which they beautifie by making Circles about their eyes with Ver|million, with which they al&s;o colour the Horns; and if they have a particular kindne&s;s for the bea&s;t, they hang them with Leaves of Guilded Tin. Every morning they wor&s;hip the Idol, and the Maids dance about it for an hour, to the noi&s;e of Fluits and Drums; after which they eat and drink and are merry till the evening, and then they wor&s;hip and dance about their Idol again.</P>
<P>Though the Idolaters never drink any &s;trong drink at other times, yet at this Fe&s;tival they drink Palm-wine, and &s;trong water, which is made of the &s;ame in remote Villages; for el&s;e their <HI>Mahometan</HI> Governour would not &s;uffer them to make Wine, nor to &s;ell any which might be brought out of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Their &s;trong Water is thus made: They take a great Earthen pot, well glaz'd within, which they call <HI>Martavane;</HI> into one of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, that holds three hundred <HI>Paris</HI> pints, of <HI>Palma</HI>-wine, they put in fifty or &s;ixty pound of brown Sugar unrefin'd, which looks like yellow Wax; with about twenty pound of a great thick bark of a Thorn, not much unlike that which our Leather-dre&s;&s;ers u&s;e. This bark &s;ets the <HI>Palma</HI>-wine a bubling and working ju&s;t like our new wines, for five or &s;ix days together, till it becomes of a &s;weet Liquor, as &s;owre as our Crabs. Then they di&s;till it, and according to the ta&s;te they would give, they either put into a Cauldron full, a little Bag of Mace, or three or four handfuls of Anni&s;e-&s;eed. They can make it al&s;o as &s;trong as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Agra</HI> in the year 1642, an Idolater, who&s;e name was <HI>Woldas,</HI> Broa|ker to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> about &s;eventy years of age, receiving news that the chief <HI>Bramin</HI> at the Pagod of <HI>Matura</HI> was dead, went to the <HI>Hollander</HI> and de&s;ir'd him to even all accounts; for &s;aid he, the chief Prie&s;t being dead, it behoves me to dye, that I may &s;erve him in the other world. Thereupon having ended his accounts, he took his Coach, with &s;ome of his Kindred; but having neither eaten nor drank from the time he receiv'd the news, he dy'd by the way; having fami&s;h'd him&s;elf for grief.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Idolaters have a cu&s;tom, that when any per&s;on gives a thing, they &s;nap their fingers, crying out, <HI>Gi-Narami,</HI> remember <HI>Narami,</HI> who was a great Saint among them, for fear the Evil Spirit, &s;hould enter into the body of him that gives.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Surat</HI> in the year 1653, a <HI>Ra&s;poute</HI> being demanded Cu&s;tom for three or four pieces of Calicut, boldly ask'd the Governour, whether a Soul|dier that had &s;erv'd the King all his life-time, ought to pay Cu&s;tom for two or three pitiful pieces of Calicut, not worth four or five Roupies; telling him it was only to cloath his Wife and Children. The Governour netl'd at his &s;awcine&s;s, call'd him <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hico,</HI> or Son of a Whore; adding, that if he were Prince he would make him pay his Cu&s;toms. Whereupon the Souldier incens'd at the affront, making as if he felt for Money to pay his dues, bearing up to the Go|vernor, &s;tab'd him in the belly, &s;o that he dy'd immediately. But the Soul|dier was pre&s;ently cut in pieces by the Governors Servants.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="254">
Though the Idolaters are in utter darkne&s;s as to the knowledg of the true God, however the Law of Nature teaches them Morality in many things. When they are married they are &s;eldom fal&s;e to their Wives. Adultery is very rare among them. And as for <HI>Sodomy</HI> I never heard it mention'd. They marry their Children between &s;even and eight years old, for fear they &s;hould fall into that vice; the Ceremonies whereof are the&s;e: The day before the Nuptials, the Bridegroom, accompany'd by all his Kindred, goes to the Hou&s;e where the Bride lives, with a great pair of Bracelets, two fingers thick, hollow within, and in two pieces, with a hinge in the middle to open them. According to the quality of the Bride tho&s;e Bracelets are of more or le&s;s value, &s;ometimes of Gold, &s;ometimes of Silver, Tin, or Latten, the poore&s;t &s;ort of all making u&s;e of Lead. The next day there is a great Fea&s;t at the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e, whi|ther all the Kindred on both &s;ides are invited, and about three a Clock in the afternoon the Bride is brought thither. Then the chief of the <HI>Bramins</HI> that are there, of which there are always &s;everal laying the head of the Bride to the Bridegrooms, pronounces &s;everal words, &s;prinkling their heads and bo|dies all the while with water. Then they bring him upon Plates or Fig-leaves &s;everal &s;orts of Meats, Calicuts, and Stuffs; and then the <HI>Bramin</HI> asks the Bridegroom, whether &s;o long as God &s;hall make him able, he will let his Wife &s;hare with him, and whether he will endeavour to maintain her by his labour. If he &s;ays yes, they all &s;et them&s;elves down to the Fea&s;t prepar'd for them, where every one eats by him&s;elf. If the Bride be rich, and be acquainted among the Nobility, their Weddings are very pompous and expen&s;ive. The Bridegroom is mounted upon an Elephant, and the Bride rides in a Chariot; the whole Company carrying Torches in their hands. They al&s;o borrow of the Governour and the Nobility of the place, as many Elephants and prancing Hor&s;es as they can get. And they walk &s;ome part of the night with Fire|works, which they throw about the Streets and Piazza's. But the greate&s;t expence to tho&s;e that live three or four hundred Leagues from it, is to get the wa|ter of <HI>Ganges;</HI> for in regard they account that water &s;acred, and drink it out of devotion&punc; it mu&s;t be brought them by the <HI>Bramins,</HI> and in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, glaz'd within &s;ide, which the chief <HI>Bramin</HI> of <HI>Ingrenate</HI> fills him&s;elf with the pure&s;t Water of the River, and then &s;eals up with his own Seal. They never drink this water till the end of the Fea&s;t, and then they give their gue&s;ts three or more gla&s;&s;es apiece. This water coming &s;o far, and the chief <HI>Bramin</HI> de|manding a Tribute for every pot, which contains a Pail-full, &s;ometimes a wed|ding comes to two or three thou&s;and Roupies.</P>
<P>The eighth of <HI>April,</HI> being in a City of <HI>Bengala</HI> call'd <HI>Malde,</HI> the Idolaters made a great Fea&s;t, according to the particular Cu&s;tom of that place; they all go out of the City, and fa&s;ten Iron hooks to the boughs of &s;everal Trees, then come a great number of poor people and hang them&s;elves, &s;ome by the &s;ides, &s;ome by the brawn of their backs, upon tho&s;e hooks, till the weight of their body tearing away the fle&s;h, they fall of them&s;elves. 'Tis a wonderful thing to &s;ee that not &s;o much as one drop of blood &s;hould i&s;&s;ue, from the wounded fle&s;h, nor that any of the fle&s;h &s;hould be left upon the hook; be&s;ides, that in two days they are perfectly cur'd by &s;uch Plai&s;ters as their <HI>Bramins</HI> give them. There are others who at that Fea&s;t will lye upon a bed of nails, with the points upward, the nails entring a good way into the fle&s;h; however while the&s;e peo|ple are under this Pennance, their Friends come and pre&s;ent them with Money and Linnen. When they have undergone their Penance, they take the pre&s;ents and di&s;tribute them to the poor, without making any farther advantage of them. I ask'd one, why they made that Fea&s;t, and &s;uffer'd tho&s;e &s;evere Pe|nances; who an&s;wer'd me, that it was in remembrance of the fir&s;t man, whom they call'd <HI>Adam,</HI> as we do.</P>
<P>In the year 1666, I &s;aw another &s;ort of Penance, as I cro&s;s'd the <HI>Ganges;</HI> upon the Bank of which River they had prepar'd a clean place, where one of the poor Idolaters was condemn'd to re&s;t upon the ground, touching it only with his hands and feet; which he was to do &s;everal times a day, and every time to ki&s;s the earth three times before he ro&s;e up again. He was to ri&s;e up upon his left foot, never touching the ground with his right all the while. And
<PB N="182" REF="255">
every day for a month together before he either eat or drank he was oblig'd to this po&s;ture for fifty times together, and con&s;equently to ki&s;s the ground a hundred and fifty times. He told me that the <HI>Bramins</HI> had enjoin'd him that Penance becau&s;e he had &s;uffer'd a Cow to dye in his Hou&s;e, and had not lead her to the water to be wa&s;h'd before &s;he dy'd.</P>
<P>When an Idolater has lo&s;t any piece of Gold or Silver, or &s;umm of Money either by negligence, or as being &s;toln from him, he is oblig'd to carry as much as he lo&s;t to the great <HI>Bramin;</HI> for if he does not, and that the other &s;hould come to know of it, he is ignominiou&s;ly ca&s;t out of his Tribe, to make him more careful another time.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide the <HI>Ganges</HI> Northward, toward the Mountains of <HI>Naugro|cot,</HI> there are two or three <HI>Raja's,</HI> who neither believe God nor the Devil. Their <HI>Bramins</HI> have a book containing their Belief, full of ridiculous ab&s;urdi|ties, whereof the Author who&s;e name is <HI>Baudou</HI> gives no rea&s;on. The&s;e <HI>Raja</HI>'s are the Great <HI>Moguls</HI> Va&s;&s;als, and pay him Tribute.</P>
<P>To conclude, the <HI>Malavares</HI> carefully pre&s;erve the nails of their left hands and let their hair grow like women's. The&s;e nails, which are half a finger long, &s;erve them in&s;tead of Combs; and it is with their left hand that they do all their drudgery, never touching their faces, nor what they eat, but with their right hands.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan</HI> whence comes the Musk, the good Rhu|barb, and &s;ome Furs.</HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Boutan</HI> is of a large extent; but I could never yet come to a perfect knowledg thereof. I have &s;et down all that I could learn at <HI>Patna,</HI> whither the Merchants of <HI>Boutan</HI> come to &s;ell their Musk. The mo&s;t excellent <HI>Rhubarb</HI> comes al&s;o from the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan.</HI> From hence is brought al&s;o that Seed which is good again&s;t the worms, therefore call'd Worm&s;eed; and good &s;tore of Furs. As for the Rhubarb, the Merchants run a great hazard which way &s;oever they bring it; for if they take the Northern Road, toward <HI>Caboul,</HI> the wet &s;poils it; if the Southern Road, in regard the journey is long, if the Rains happen to fall, there is as much danger that way, &s;o that there is no Commodity requires more care than that.</P>
<P>As for the Musk, during the heats the Merchant lo&s;es by it, becau&s;e it dries and lo&s;es its weight. Now in regard this Commodity pays twenty-five in the hundred Cu&s;tom at <HI>Gorrochepour,</HI> the la&s;t Town belonging to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> next to the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan,</HI> when the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants come to that City, they go to the officer at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and tell him that they are going to <HI>Boutan,</HI> to buy Musk or Rhubarb, and how much they intend to lay out; all which the Officer regi&s;ters, with the name of the Merchant. Then the Merchants in&s;tead of twenty-five, agree with him for &s;even or eight in the hundred, and take a Certificate from the Officer or Cadi, that he may not de|mand any more at their return. If the Officer refu&s;es a hand&s;om compo&s;ition, then they go another way, over De&s;arts and Mountains cover'd with Snow, tedious and trouble&s;ome, till they come to <HI>Caboul,</HI> where the Caravans part, &s;ome for great <HI>Tartary,</HI> others for <HI>Belch.</HI> Here it is that the Merchants coming from <HI>Boutan</HI> barter their Commodities for Hor&s;es, Mules, and Camels; for there is little Money in that Country. Then tho&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> tran&s;port their Commo|dities into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as far as <HI>Ardevile</HI> and <HI>Tauris;</HI> which is the rea&s;on that &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> have thought that Rhubarb and Worm&s;eed came out of <HI>Tartary.</HI> True it is, that &s;ome Rhubarb comes from thence; but not &s;o good as that of <HI>Boutan,</HI> being &s;ooner corrupted; for Rhubarb will eat out its own heart. The <HI>Tartars</HI> carry back out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Silks of Small value, which are made in <HI>Tauris</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="255">
and <HI>Ardevile,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth brought by the <HI>Armenians</HI> from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Some of the Merchants that come from <HI>Caboul</HI> and <HI>Bou|tan</HI> go to <HI>Candahar,</HI> and thence to <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> whither they carry Coral in Beads, yellow Amber, and <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> Beads, if they can meet with it. The other Merchants that come from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Multan, Lahor,</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> bring only Linnons, Indigo, and &s;tore of <HI>Cornelian</HI> and Chri&s;tal Beads. Tho&s;e that return through <HI>Gorrochepour,</HI> and are agreed with the Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, carry from <HI>Patna</HI> and <HI>Daca,</HI> Coral, yellow Amber, Bracelets of Tortoi&s;e-&s;hells, and other Shells, with great &s;tore of round and &s;quare thick pieces of Tor|tois. When I was at <HI>Patna,</HI> four <HI>Armenians</HI> who had been before at <HI>Boutan,</HI> return'd from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where they had made certain Figures of yellow Am|ber, repre&s;enting the &s;hapes of &s;everal Creatures and Mon&s;ters, which they were carrying to the King of <HI>Boutan,</HI> who is an Idolater, as are all his people, to &s;et up in his Pagods. For the <HI>Armenians</HI> for Money will &s;ell any thing of Ido|latry; and they told me be&s;ides, that if they could but have made the Idol which the King of <HI>Boutan</HI> be&s;poke of them, they &s;hould have done their bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Which was to have been a Mon&s;ters head, with &s;ix horns, four ears, four arms, and &s;ix fingers upon every hand, all of yellow Amber; but they could not find pieces big enough.</P>
<P>The Caravan is three months travelling from <HI>Patna,</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Bou|tan.</HI> It &s;ets out from <HI>Patna</HI> about the end of <HI>December,</HI> and eight days after arrives at <HI>Gorrochepour.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Gorrochepour</HI> to the foot of the high Mountains, is eight or nine days journey more, during which the Caravan &s;uffers very much hard&s;hip, for the Country is nothing but wild Forre&s;ts, full of wild Elephants. So that the Mer|chants, in&s;tead of taking their re&s;ts, are forc'd to watch, keep fires, and &s;hoot off their Muskets all the night long. For the Elephant making no noi&s;e in tread|ing, would el&s;e be upon the Caravan before they were aware; not that he comes to do any mi&s;chief to the men, but to get what victuals he can find. You may travel from <HI>Patna</HI> to the foot of tho&s;e Mountains in Palleki's. But gene|rally they ride upon Oxen, Camels, or Hor&s;es, bred in the Countrey. Tho&s;e Hor&s;es are generally &s;o little, that when a man is upon the back of them, his feet touch the Ground; but they will travel twenty Leagues an end, and never bait, or el&s;e with a very &s;mall one. Some of tho&s;e Hor&s;es co&s;t two hundred Crowns; for indeed when you come to cro&s;s, the Mountains, you can make u&s;e of no other &s;ort of carriage but them in regard of the narrowne&s;s and rug|gedne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;es; which many times put the Hor&s;es very much to it, as &s;trong and as low as they are.</P>
<P>Five or &s;ix Leagues beyond <HI>Gorrochepour</HI> you enter into the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Nupal,</HI> which extend to the Frontiers of the Kindom of <HI>Boutan.</HI> This <HI>Raja</HI> is a Tributary to the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and pays him every year an Elephant for his Homage. He re&s;ides in the City of <HI>Nupal,</HI> from whence he derives his Title; but there is little either Trade or Money in his Country, which is all Woods and Forre&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Caravan being arriv'd at the foot of the&s;e Mountains which are call'd at this day by the name of <HI>Naugrocot,</HI> abundance of people come from all parts of the Mountain, the greate&s;t part whereof are women and maids, who agree with the Merchants to carry them, their Goods and provi&s;ions cro&s;s the Mountains, which is eight days journey more.</P>
<P>The women carry upon each &s;houlder a woollen Roll, to which is fa&s;ten'd a large Cu&s;hion, that hangs down upon their backs, upon which the man &s;its. There are three women to carry one man, relieving one another by turns. And for their luggage and provi&s;ions, they lade them upon Goats, that will carry a hundred and fifty pound weight apiece. Tho&s;e that will ride, are in many places forc'd to have their Hor&s;es hoi&s;ted up with Cords. They never &s;eed them but morning and evening mixing a pound of meal, half a pound of brown Sugar, and half a pound of Butter together, with water &s;ufficient. In the evening they mu&s;t be contented only with a few flat Pea&s;on, bruis'd, and &s;teep'd half an hour in water. The women that carry the men, get for their ten days travel two Roupies apiece, and as much for every&punc; burthen which the Goats carry, and for every Hor&s;e which they lead.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="256">
After you have pa&s;s'd the Mountains, you may travel to <HI>Boutan</HI> upon Oxen, Camels, Hor&s;es, or Palleki's, which you plea&s;e. The Country, is good, abound|ing in Rice, Corn, Pul&s;e, and &s;tore of Wine. All the people both men and wo|men are clad in the Summer with a large piece of Fu&s;tian, or Hempen-Cloath; in the Winter with a thick Cloath, almo&s;t like Felt. Both men and women wear upon their heads a kinde of Bonnet, much like our drinking Cans, which they adorn with Boars teeth, and with round and &s;quare pieces of Tortois-Shells. The richer &s;ort intermix Coral and Amber Beads, of which their women make them Neck-Laces. The men as well as the woman wear Bracelets upon their left hands only, from the wri&s;t to the elbow. The woman wear them &s;trait, the men lo&s;e. About their necks they wear a &s;ilken twi&s;t, at the end where|of hangs a Bead of yellow Amber or Coral, or a Boars Tooth, which dangles upon their Brea&s;ts. On their left &s;ides, their Girdles are button'd with Beads of the &s;ame. Though they be Idolaters, yet they feed upon all &s;ort of food, except the fle&s;h of Cows, which they adore as the common Nur&s;es of all men; they are be&s;ides great lovers of &s;trong water. They ob&s;erve al&s;o &s;ome Cere|monies of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> burning Amber at the end of their Fea&s;ts, though they do not wor&s;hip fire like the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> For which rea&s;on the Merchants of <HI>Bou|tan</HI> will give at <HI>Patna</HI> for a <HI>Serre</HI> of large pieces of yellow Amber, as big as a Nut, bright and clean, thirty-five and forty Roupies. The <HI>Serre</HI> of yellow Am|ber, Musk, Coral, Ambergrea&s;e, Rhubarb, and other Drugs, containing nine Ounces to the pound. Saltpeter, Sugar, Rice, Corn, and other Commodities, are al&s;o &s;old by the <HI>Serre</HI> in <HI>Bengala;</HI> but the <HI>Serre</HI> contains &s;eventy-two of our Pounds, at &s;ixteen Ounces to the Pound; and forty <HI>Serres</HI> make a <HI>Mein,</HI> or 2824 Pounds of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>To return to yellow Amber a piece of nine ounces is worth in <HI>Boutan</HI> from 250 to 300 Roupies, according to its colour and beauty. Coral rough, or wrought into Beads, yields profit enough; but they had rather have it rough, to &s;hape it as they plea&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Women and Maids are generally the Arti&s;ts among them, as to tho&s;e toys. They al&s;o make Beads of Cry&s;tal and <HI>Agat.</HI> As for the Men, they make Bracelets of Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, and Sea-&s;hells, and poli&s;h tho&s;e little pieces of Shells which the Northern people wear in their ears, and in their hair. In <HI>Patna</HI> and <HI>Daca</HI> there are above two thou&s;and per&s;ons that thus employ them&s;elves, furni&s;hing the King|doms of <HI>Boutan, A&s;em, Siam,</HI> and other Northern and Ea&s;tern parts of the <HI>Mo|gul</HI>'s Dominions.</P>
<P>As for Worm&s;eed, the Herb grows in the Fields, and mu&s;t dye before the Seed can be gather'd; but the mi&s;chief is, that before the Seed is ripe, the wind &s;cat|ters the greate&s;t part, which makes it &s;o &s;cearce. When they gather the Seed, they take two little Hampers, and as they go along the Fields, they move their Hampers from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, as if they were mowing the Herb, bowing it at the top, and &s;o all the Seed falls into the Hampers.</P>
<P>Rhubarb is a Root which they cut in pieces, and &s;tringing them by ten or twelve together, hang them up a drying.</P>
<P>Had the Natives of <HI>Boutan</HI> as much art in killing the Martin as the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> they might vend great &s;tore of tho&s;e rich Furs, con&s;idering what a number of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts there are in that Countrey. No &s;ooner does that creature peep out of his hole, but the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who lye upon the watch, have 'em pre&s;ently, either in the no&s;e or in the eyes; for &s;hould they hit 'em in the body, the blood would quite &s;poyl the skin.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Boutan</HI> has con&s;tantly &s;even or eight thou&s;and Men for his Guard. Their Weapons are for the mo&s;t part Bows and Arrows. Some of them carry Battel-axes, and Bucklers. 'Tis a long time ago &s;ince they had the fir&s;t u&s;e of Muskets and Cannons: their Gun-Powder being long, but of an extraordinary force. They a&s;&s;ur'd me that &s;ome of their Cannons had Letters and Figures up|on them, that were above five hunder'd years old. They dare not &s;tir out of the Kingdom without the Governor's particular leave; nor dare they carry a Musket along with them, unle&s;s their next Kindred will undertake for them that they &s;hall bring it back. Otherwi&s;e I had brought one along with me; for by the cha|racters

upon the Barrel, it appear'd to have been made above 180 years, It was very thick, the mouth of the bore being like a Tulip, poli&s;h'd within as bright as a Looking-gla&s;s. Two thirds of the Barrel were garni&s;h'd with embo&s;s'd Wires, with certain Flowers of Gold and Silver inlaid between; and it carri'd a Bullet that weigh'd an ounce. But I could not prevail with the Merchant to &s;ell it me nor to give me any of his powder.</P>
<P>There are always fifty Elephants kept about the King's Hou&s;e, and twenty-five Camels, with each a Pice of Artillery mounted upon his back, that carries half a pound Ball. Behind the Gun fits a Cannoneer that manages and levels the Guns as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>There is no King in the World more fear'd and more re&s;pected by his Subjects then the King of <HI>Boutan;</HI> being in a manner ador'd by them. When he &s;its to do Ju&s;tice, or give Audience, all that appear in his pre&s;ence hold their hands clo&s;e to|gether above their forheads: and at a di&s;tance from the Throne pro&s;trate them|&s;elves upon the ground, not daring to lift up their heads. In this humble po&s;ture they make their Petitions to the King; and when they retire, they go backwards till they are quite out of his &s;ight. One thing they told me for truth, that when the King has done the deeds of nature, they dilligently pre&s;erve the ordure, dry it and powder it, like &s;neezing-powder: and then putting it into Boxes, they go every Market-day, and pre&s;ent it to the chief Merchants, and rich Farmers, who recompence them for their kindne&s;s: that tho&s;e people al&s;o carry it home, as a great rarity, and when they fea&s;t their Friends, &s;trew it upon their meat. Two <HI>Boutan</HI> Merchants &s;hew'd me their Boxes, and the Powder that was in them.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Boutan</HI> are &s;trong and well proportion'd; but their no&s;es and faces are &s;omewhat flat. Their women are &s;aid to be bigger and more vigo|rous than the men; but that they are much more troubled with &s;wellings in the throat then the men, few e&s;caping that di&s;ea&s;e. They know not what war is, having no enemy to fear but the <HI>Mogul.</HI> But from him they are &s;enc'd with high, &s;teep, craggy, and &s;howey Mountains. Northward there are nothing but va&s;t Forre&s;ts and Snow. Ea&s;t and We&s;t nothing but bitter water. And as for the <HI>Raja's</HI> near them, they are Princes of little force.</P>
<P>There is certainly &s;ome Silver Mine in the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan,</HI> for the King coins much Silver, in pieces that are of the value of a Roupy. The pieces are alredy de&s;crib'd. However the <HI>Boutan</HI> Merchants could not tell me where the Mine lay. And as for their Gold, that little they have is brought them from the Ea&s;t, by the Merchants of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>In the year 1659, the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy's</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours pa&s;s'd through this Country to the King of <HI>China.</HI> They were three of the greate&s;t Noblemen in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and were at fir&s;t very well receiv'd; but when they were brought to ki&s;s the Kings hands, the cu&s;tom being to pro&s;trate them&s;elves three times to the ground, they refus'd to do it, &s;aying that they would complement the King after their manner, and as they approach'd their own Emperor, who was as great and as potent as the Emperor of <HI>China.</HI> Thereupon, and for that they con|tinu'd in their re&s;olution, they were di&s;mi&s;s'd with their pre&s;ents, not being ad|mitted to &s;ee the King. But had tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors conform'd to the cu&s;tom of <HI>China,</HI> without doubt we might have had a beaten rode through <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and the North part of Great <HI>Tartary,</HI> and much more Commerce and knowledge of the Country than now we have.</P>
<P>This mentioning the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> puts me in mind of a &s;tory that &s;everal <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> Merchants averr'd to be true, upon the rode between <HI>Tauris</HI> and <HI>I&s;|pahan,</HI> where I overtook them, of a woman of four &s;core and two years of age, who at tho&s;e years was brought to bed in one of the Cities of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> of a Male Child, which was carry'd to the Duke, and by him brought up at the Court.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>Tipra.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MO&s;t people have been of opinion till now, that the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> lies upon the Frontiers of <HI>China;</HI> and I thought &s;o my &s;elf, till the Merchants of <HI>Tipra</HI> undeceiv'd me. I met with three, one at <HI>Daca,</HI> and two others at <HI>Patna.</HI> They were men of very few words; whether it were their own particular di&s;po&s;ition, or the General habit of the Country. They ca&s;t up their accounts with &s;mall Stones likes Agats, as big as a mans nail, upon every one of which was a Cypher. They had every one their weights, like a Stelleer; though the Beam were not of Iron, but of a certain Wood as hard as Brazile; nor was the Ring that holds the weight, and is put thorough the Beam to mark the weight, of Iron, but a &s;trong Silk Rope. And thus they weigh'd from a Dram to ten of our Pounds. If all the Natives of the King|dom of <HI>Tipra,</HI> were like the two Merchants which I met at <HI>Patna,</HI> I dare af|firm them to be notable topers; for they never refus'd whatever &s;trong Li|quor I gave them, and never left till all was out; and when I told them by my Interpreter that all my Wine was gone, they clapt their hands upon their &s;tomachs and &s;igh'd. The&s;e Merchants travell'd all three through the King|dom of <HI>Arakan,</HI> which lies to the South and We&s;t of <HI>Tipra,</HI> having &s;ome part of <HI>Pegu</HI> upon the Winter we&s;t. They told me al&s;o, that it was about fifteen days journey to cro&s;s through their Country; from whence there is no cer|tain conjecture of the extent to be made, by rea&s;on of the inequality of the &s;tages. They ride upon Oxen and Hor&s;es, which are low, but very hardy. As for the King and the Nobility, they ride in their Pallekies, or upon their Ele|phants of War. They are no le&s;s &s;ubject to Wens under their throats, than tho&s;e of <HI>Boutan;</HI> in&s;omuch that the women have tho&s;e Wens hanging down to their Nipples; which proceeds from the badne&s;s of the waters.</P>
<P>There is nothing in <HI>Tipra</HI> which is fit for &s;trangers. There is a Mine of Gold, but the Gold is very cour&s;e. And there is a &s;ort of very cour&s;e Silk, which is all the Revenue the King has. He exacts no Sub&s;idies from his Subjects; but only that they, who are not of the prime Nobility, &s;hould work &s;ix days in a year in his Mine, or in his Silk-works. He &s;ends his Gold and his Silk into <HI>China,</HI> for which they bring him back Silver, which he coins into pieces to the value of ten Sous. He al&s;o makes thin pieces of Gold, like to the <HI>A&s;pers</HI> of <HI>Turky;</HI> of which he two &s;orts, four of the one &s;ort making a Crown, and twelve of the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;em.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was never known what the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;em</HI> was, till <HI>Mirgimola</HI> had &s;etl'd <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> in the Empire. For he con&s;idering that he &s;hould be no longer valu'd at Court, after the War was at an end, being then General of <HI>Au|reng-zeb</HI>'s Army and powerful in the Kingdom where he had great &s;tore of Creatures, to pre&s;erve the Authority he had, re&s;olv'd to undertake the Con|que&s;t of the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;em;</HI> where he knew he &s;hould find little or no re|&s;i&s;tance, that Kingdom having been at peace above 500 years before. 'Tis thought the&s;e were the people that formerly invented Guns and Powder; which &s;pread it &s;elf from <HI>A&s;em</HI> to <HI>Pegu,</HI> and from <HI>Pegu</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> from whence the inventi|on has been attributed to the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> However certain it is, that <HI>Mirgimola</HI> brought from thence &s;everal pieces of Canon, which were all Iron Guns, and &s;tore of excellent Powder, both made in that Country. The Powder is round and &s;mall, like ours, and very &s;trong.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgimola</HI> embark'd his Army in one of the mouths of <HI>Ganges,</HI> and &s;ailing up one of the Rivers that comes from the Lake <HI>Chiamay,</HI> to the twenty-ninth or thirtieth Degree, he landed his Army, and came into a Country abounding in all humane nece&s;&s;aries, &s;till finding the le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance becau&s;e the people were &s;urpriz'd. Being a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> he &s;par'd not the very Pagods, but burn'd and &s;ack'd all where-ever he came to the thirty-fifth Degree. There he under|&s;tood that the King of <HI>A&s;em</HI> was in the field with a more powerfull Army than he expected, and that he had &s;everal pieces of Canon, and great &s;tore of fire-works withall. Thereupon <HI>Mirgimola</HI> thought it not convenient to march any farther; though the chief rea&s;on of his return was the drawing on of Winter; which the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to make them &s;tir beyond the thirti'th or thirty-fifth Degree, e&s;pecially to hazard their lives.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgimola</HI> therefore turns to the South-we&s;t, and be&s;ieges a City call'd <HI>Azoo,</HI> which he took in a &s;mall time, and found good plunder therein. In this City of <HI>Azoo,</HI> are the Tombs of the Kings of <HI>A&s;em,</HI> and of all the Royal Family. For though they are Idolaters, they never burn their dead bodies, but bury them. They believe that the dead go into another world, where they that have liv'd well in this, have plenty of all things; but that they who have been ill livers, &s;uffer the want of all things, being in a more e&s;pecial manner afflicted with hunger and drowth; and that therefore it is good, to bury &s;omething with them to &s;erve them in their nece&s;&s;ities. This was the rea&s;on that <HI>Mirgimola</HI> found &s;o much wealth in the City of <HI>Azoo.</HI> For many ages, together, &s;everal King had built them Chappels in the great Pagod to be buried in, and in their life times had &s;tor'd up in the Vaults of their particular Chappels, great &s;ums of Gold and Silver, and other moveables of value. Be&s;ides, that when they bury the deceas'd King, they bury with him likewi&s;e whatever he e&s;teem'd mo&s;t precious in his life-time, whether it were an Idol of Gold or Silver, or what|ever el&s;e, that being needful in this, might be nece&s;&s;ary for him in the world to come. But that which &s;avours mo&s;t of Barbari&s;m is, that when he dies, all his be&s;t beloved Wives, and the principal Officers of his Hou&s;e poy&s;on them|&s;elves, to be buri'd with him, and to wait upon him in the other world. Be|&s;ides this, they bury one Elephant, twelve Camels, &s;ix Hor&s;es, and a good num|ber of Hounds, believing that all tho&s;e Creatures ri&s;e again to &s;erve their King.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>A&s;em</HI> is one of the be&s;t Countries of all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> for it pro|duces all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, without any need of foreign &s;upply. There are in it Mines of Gold, Silver, Steel, Lead, Iron, and great &s;tore of Silk, but coar&s;e. There is a &s;ort of Silk that is found under the Trees, which is &s;pun by a Creature like to our Silk-worms, but rounder,
<PB N="188" REF="258">
and which lives all the year long under the trees. The Silks which are made of this Silk gli&s;t'n very much, but they fret pre&s;ently. The Country produces al&s;o great &s;tore of Gum-Lake; of which there is two &s;orts, one grows under the trees of a red colour, wherewith they paint their Linnen, and Stuffs; and when they have drawn out the red juice, the remaining &s;ub&s;tance &s;erves to var|ni&s;h Cabinets, and to make Wax; being the be&s;t Lake in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> for tho&s;e u&s;es. As for their Gold they never &s;uffer it to be tran&s;ported out of the Kingdom, nor do they make any Money of it; but they pre&s;erve it all in Ingots, which pa&s;s in trade among the Inhabitants; but as for the Silver, the King coins it into Money, as is already de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>Though the Country be very plentiful of all things, yet there is no fle&s;h which they e&s;teem &s;o much as Dogs fle&s;h; which is the greate&s;t delicacy at all Fea&s;ts; and is &s;old every month in every City of the Kingdom upon their Market-days. There are al&s;o great &s;tore of Vines, and very good Grapes, but they never make any Wine; only they dry the Grapes to make <HI>Aqua Vitae.</HI> As for &s;alt they have none but what is artificial, which they make two wayes. Fir&s;t they rai&s;e great heaps of that green Stuff that Swims at the tops of &s;tanding waters, which the Ducks and Frogs eat, This they dry and burn; and the a&s;hes thereof being boil'd in a Cloth in water, become very good Salt. The other way mo&s;t in u&s;e is to take the leaves of <HI>Adams</HI> Fig-tree, which they dry and burn; the a&s;hes whereof make a Salt &s;o tart, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to eat until the tartne&s;s be tak'n away; which they do by putting the a&s;hes in water, where they &s;tir them ten or twelve hours together; then they &s;train the &s;ub&s;tance through a Linnen Cloth and boil it; as the water boils away, the bottom thick'ns; and when the water is all boil'd away they find at the bottom very good and white Salt.</P>
<P>Of the A&s;hes of the&s;e Fig-leaves they make a Lye, wherewith they wa&s;h their Silk, which makes it as white as Snow; but they have not enough to whiten half the Silk that grows in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Kenneroof</HI> is the name of the City, where the King of <HI>A&s;em</HI> keeps his Court; twenty-five or thirty days journey from that which was formerly the Capital City, and bore the &s;ame name. The King requires no Sub&s;idies of his peo|ple; but all the Mines in his Kingdom are his own; where for the ea&s;e of his Subjects, he has none but &s;laves that work; &s;o that all the Natives of <HI>A&s;em</HI> live at their ea&s;e, and every one has his hou&s;e by him&s;elf, and in the middle of his ground a fountain encompa&s;s'd with trees and mo&s;t commonly every one an Elephant to carry their Wives; for they have four Wives, and when they marry, they &s;ay to one, I take the to &s;erve me in &s;uch a thing; to the other, I appoint the to do &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that every one of the wives knows what &s;he has to do in the Hou&s;e. The men and women are generally well complexi|on'd; only tho&s;e that live more Southerly are more &s;warthy, and not &s;o &s;ub|ject to Wens in their throats; neither are they &s;o well featur'd, be&s;ides that the women are &s;omewhat flat Nos'd. In the Southern parts the people go &s;tark naked, only covering their private parts, with a Bonnet like a blew Cap upon their heads, hung about with Swines teeth. They pierce holes in their ears, that you may thru&s;t your Thumb in where they hang pieces of Gold and Silver. Bracelets al&s;o of Tortoi&s;e-&s;hells, and Sea-&s;hells as long as an egg, which they &s;aw into Circles, are in great e&s;teem among the meaner &s;ort; as Bracelets of Coral and yellow Amber among tho&s;e that are rich. When they bury a man, all his Friends and Relations mu&s;t come to the burial; and when they lay the body in the ground, they all take off their Bracelets from their Arms and Legs, and bury them with the Corps.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> lies between the Golf of <HI>Siam,</HI> and the Golf of <HI>Bengala;</HI> bordering upon <HI>Pegu</HI> toward the North, and the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Malacca</HI> toward the South. The &s;horte&s;t and neare&s;t way for the <HI>Europaeans</HI> to go to this Kingdom, is to go to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> from <HI>Ormus</HI> to <HI>Surat,</HI> from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Golconda,</HI> from <HI>Golconda</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> there to embark for <HI>Denou&s;erin,</HI> which is one of the Ports belonging to the King|dom of <HI>Siam.</HI> From <HI>Denou&s;erin</HI> to the Capital City, which is al&s;o call'd <HI>Siam,</HI> is thirty-five days journey, part by Water, part by Land, by Waggon, or upon Elephants. The way, whether by Land or Water, is very trouble&s;ome; for by Land you mu&s;t be always upon your guard for fear of Tigers and Lions; by Water, by rea&s;on of the many falls of the River, they are forc'd to hoi&s;e up their Boats with Engines.</P>
<P>All the Country of <HI>Siam,</HI> is very plentiful in Rice and Fruits; the chiefe&s;t whereof are <HI>Mangos, Durions,</HI> and <HI>Mangustans.</HI> The Fore&s;ts are full of Harts, Elephants, Tigers, Rhinocero's, and Apes; where there grow al&s;o large Bambou's in great abundance. Under the knots of the&s;e Bambou's are Emets ne&s;ts as big as a mans head, where every Emet has his apartment by him&s;elf; but there is but one hole to enter into the ne&s;t. They make their ne&s;ts in the&s;e Canes to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the rains which continue four or five months together.</P>
<P>In the night time the Serpents are very bu&s;ie. There are &s;ome two foot long, with two heads; but one of them has no motion.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another creature in <HI>Siam,</HI> like our <HI>Salamander,</HI> with a forked tail, and very venomous.</P>
<P>The Rivers in this Kingdom are very large; and that which runs by <HI>Siam</HI> is equally as large as the re&s;t. The water is very whole&s;ome; but it is very full of Crocodiles of a mon&s;trous bigne&s;s, that devour men if they be not very care|ful of them&s;elves. The&s;e Rivers overflow their banks while the Sun is in the Southern Tropick; which makes the fields to be very fertil as far as they flow; and it is ob&s;erv'd, that the Rice grows higher or lower, as the floods do more or le&s;s increa&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Siam,</HI> the Capital City of the Kingdom, where the King keeps his Court, is wall'd about, being about three of our Leagues in circuit; it is &s;ituated in an I&s;land, the River running quite round it, and might be ea&s;ily brought into eve|ry &s;treet in the Town, if the King would but lay out as much Money upno that de&s;ign, as he &s;pends in Temples and Idols.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siamers</HI> have thirty-three Letters in their Alphabet. But they write from the left to the right, as we do, contrary to the cu&s;tom of <HI>Japon, China, Cochinchina,</HI> and <HI>Tunquin,</HI> who write from the right to the left.</P>
<P>All the Natives of this Kingdom are &s;laves, either to the King or the great Lords. The women as well as the men cut their hair; neither are they very rich in their habits. Among their Complements, the chiefe&s;t is, never to go before a per&s;on that they re&s;pect, unle&s;s they fir&s;t ask leave, which they do by holding up both their hands. Tho&s;e that are rich have &s;everal Wives.</P>
<P>The Money of the Country is already de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> is one of the riche&s;t Monarchs in the Ea&s;t, and &s;tiles him|&s;elf King of Heaven and Earth; though he be Tributary to the King of <HI>China.</HI> He &s;eldom &s;hews him&s;elf to his Subjects; and never gives Audience, but to the Principal Favourites of his Court. He tru&s;ts to his Mini&s;ters of State, for the management of his affairs, who &s;ometimes make very bad u&s;e of their authority. He never &s;hews him&s;elf in publick above twice a year; but then it is with an extraordinary magnificence. The fir&s;t is, when he goes to a cer|tain Pagod within the City, which is guilded round both within and without. There are three Idols between &s;ix and &s;even foot high, which are all of ma&s;&s;ie.
<PB N="190" REF="259">
Gold; which he believes he renders propitious to him, by the great &s;tore of Alms that he di&s;tributes among the poor, and the pre&s;ents which he makes to the Prie&s;ts. Then he goes attended by all his Court, and puts to open view the riche&s;t Ornaments he has. One part of his magnificence con&s;i&s;ts in his train of two hundred Elephants; among which there is one that is white, which the King &s;o highly e&s;teems, that he &s;tiles him&s;elf King of the <HI>White Elephant.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd time the King appears in publick, is when he goes to another Pagod five or &s;ix Leagues above the Town, up the River. But no per&s;on mu&s;t enter into this Pagod, unle&s;s it be the King and his Prie&s;ts. As for the people, &s;o &s;oon as they &s;ee the Door op'n, they mu&s;t pre&s;ently fall upon their Faces to the Earth. Then the King appears upon the River with two hundred Gallies of a prodigious length; four hundred Rowers belonging to every one of the Gallies; mo&s;t of them being guilded and carv'd very richly. Now in regard this &s;econd appearance of the King is in the month of <HI>No|vember,</HI> when the waters begin to abate, the Prie&s;ts make the people believe that none but the King can &s;top the cour&s;e of the waters, by his Prayers and by his Offerings to this Pagod. and they are &s;o vain as to think that the King cuts the waters with his <HI>Sabra,</HI> or Skain; thereby commanding it to retire back into the Sea.</P>
<P>The King al&s;o goes, but <HI>incognito,</HI> to a Pagod in an I&s;land where the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> have a Factory. There is at the entry thereof an Idol &s;itting cro&s;s|leg'd with one hand upon his knee, and the other arm akimbo. It is above &s;ixty foot high; and round about this Idol are about three hundred others, of &s;everal&punc;&s;orts and &s;izes. All the&s;e Idols are guilt. And indeed there are a prodigious number of Pagods in this Country; for every rich <HI>Siomer</HI> cau&s;es one to be built in memory of him&s;elf. Tho&s;e Pagods have Steeples and Bells, and the Walls within are painted and guilded; but the Windows are &s;o nar|row that they give but a very dim light. The two Pagods to which the King goes publickly, are adorn'd with &s;everal tall Pyramids, well guilded. And to that in the <HI>Hollanders</HI> I&s;land there belongs a Cloy&s;ter, which is a very neat Structure. In the middle of the Pagod is a fair Chappel, all guild|ed within &s;ide; where they find a Lamp, and three Wax Candles continually burning before the Altar, which is all over cover'd with Idols, &s;ome of Ma&s;&s;ie Gold, others of Copper guilt. In the Pagod in the mid&s;t of the Town, and in one of tho&s;e to which the King goes once a year, there are above four thou&s;and Idols; and for that which is &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Siam,</HI> it is &s;urround|ded with Pyramids, who&s;e beauty makes the indu&s;try of that Nation to be admir'd.</P>
<P>When the King appears, all the Doors and Windows of the Hou&s;es mu&s;t be &s;hut; and all the people pro&s;trate them&s;elves upon the ground, not da|ring to lift up their eyes. And becau&s;e no per&s;on is to be in a higher place than the King, they that are within doors, are bound to keep their lowe&s;t Rooms. When he cuts his hair, one of his Wives performs that office, for he will not &s;uffer a Barber to come near him.</P>
<P>This Prince has a Pa&s;&s;ionate kindne&s;s for his Elephants; which he looks upon as his Favourites, and the Ornaments of his Kingdom. If there be any of them that fall &s;ick, the Lords of the Court are mighty careful to plea&s;e their Soveraign; and if they happ'n to dye, they are buried with the &s;ame Funeral Pomp as the Nobles of the Kingdom; which are thus perform'd: They &s;et up a kind of <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> or Tomb of Reeds, cover'd with Paper; in the mid&s;t whereof they lay as much &s;weet wood as the body weighs, and after the Prie&s;ts have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">umbl'd certain Or&s;ons, they &s;et it a-fire, and burn it to a&s;hes; which the rich pre&s;erve in Gold or Silver Urns&punc; but the poor &s;catter in the wind. As for offenders, they never burn, but bury them.</P>
<P>'Tis thought that in this Kingdom there are above two hundred Prie&s;ts, which they call <HI>Bonzes&punc;</HI> which are highly reverenc'd as well at Court as among the people. The King him&s;elf has &s;uch a value for &s;ome of them, as to hum|ble him&s;elf before them. This extraordinary re&s;pect makes them &s;o proud, that &s;ome of them have a&s;pir'd to the Throne. But when the King di&s;covers
<PB N="191" REF="259">
any &s;uch de&s;ign, he puts them to death. And one of them had his head lately &s;truck off for his Ambition.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Bonzes</HI> wear yellow, with a little red Cloth about their Wa&s;ts; like a Girdle. Outwardly they are very mode&s;t, and are never &s;een to be angry. About four in the morning, upon the tolling of their Bells, they ri&s;e to their prayers, which they repeat again toward evening. There are &s;ome days in the year when they retire from all conver&s;e, with men. Some of them live by Alms; others have Hou&s;es with good Revenues. While they wear the Ha|bit of <HI>Bonzes,</HI> they mu&s;t not marry; for if they do, they mu&s;t lay their Ha|bit a&s;ide. They are generally very ignorant, not knowing what they believe. Yet they hold the tran&s;migration of Souls into &s;everal Bodies. They are for|bid to kill any Creature; yet they will make no &s;cruple to eat what others kill, or that which dies of it &s;elf. They &s;ay that the God of the Chri&s;tians and theirs were Brothers; but that theirs was the elde&s;t. If you ask them where their God is, they &s;ay, he vani&s;h'd away, and they know not where he is.</P>
<P>The chief &s;trength of the Kingdom is their Infantry, which is indifferent good; the Soldiers are us'd to hard&s;hip, going all quite naked, except their private parts; all the re&s;t of their body, looking as if it had been cupt, is carv'd into &s;everal &s;hapes of bea&s;ts and flowers. When they have cut their skins, and &s;tanch'd the blood, they rub the cut-work with &s;uch colours as they think mo&s;t proper. So that afar off you would think they were clad in &s;ome kind of flower'd Satin or other; for the colours never rub out. Their Weapons are Bows and Arrows, Pike and Musket&punc; and an <HI>Azagaya,</HI> or Staff between five and &s;ix foot long, with a long Iron Spike at the end, which they very dextrou&s;ly dart at the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the year 1665, there was at <HI>Siam</HI> a <HI>Neapolitan Je&s;uite</HI> who was call'd Father <HI>Thomas;</HI> he caus'd the Town and the Kings Palace to be fortifi'd with very good Bulwarks, according to Art; for which rea&s;on the King gave him leave to live in the City, where he has a Hou&s;e and a little Church.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kingdom of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> and the Emba&s;&s;adors which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;ent into <HI>China.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd the <HI>I&s;le of Celebes,</HI> begins at the fifteenth Degree of Southern Latitude. The heats are exce&s;&s;ive all the day; but the nights are temperate enough. And for the Soil, it is very fertile; but the people have not the art of building. The Capital City bears the name of the Kingdom, and is &s;ituated upon the Sea. The Port is free; for the Ve&s;&s;els that bring great quantities of goods from the Adjacent I&s;lands, pay no Cu&s;toms. The I&s;landers have a cu&s;tom to poy&s;on their Arrows; and the mo&s;t dangerous poy&s;on which they u&s;e, is the juice of certain Trees in the I&s;land of <HI>Borneo;</HI> which they will temper &s;o as to work &s;wift or &s;low, as they plea&s;e. They hold that the King has only the &s;ecret Receit to take away the force of it; who boa&s;ts that he has the mo&s;t effectual poy&s;on in the world, which there is no remedy can prevent.</P>
<P>One day an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man in heat of blood had kill'd one of the Kings of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars</HI> Subjects; and though the King had pardon'd him, yet both <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> fearing if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man &s;hould go unpuni&s;h'd, le&s;t the I&s;landers &s;hould revenge them&s;elves upon &s;ome of them, be&s;ought the King to put him to death; which with much ado being con&s;ented to, the King un|willing to put him to a lingring death, and de&s;irous to &s;hew the effect of his poy&s;on, re&s;olv'd to &s;hoot the Criminal him&s;elf; whereupon he took a long Trunk, and &s;hot him exactly into the great Toe of the right foot, the place particularly aim'd at. Two Chirurgeons, one an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man, and the other a <HI>Hollander,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="260">
provided on purpo&s;e, immediately cut off the member; but for all that, the poy&s;on had di&s;pers'd it &s;elf &s;o &s;peedily, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man dy'd at the &s;ame time. All the Kings and Princes of the Ea&s;t are very diligent in their enquiry after &s;trong Poy&s;ons. And I remember that the chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory and I try'd &s;everal poy&s;on'd Arrows, with which the King of <HI>Achen</HI> had pre&s;ented him, by &s;hooting at Squirrels, who fell down dead, as &s;oon as ever they were touch'd.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> is a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and will not &s;uffer his Subjects to embrace Chri&s;tianity. Yet in the year 1656, the Chri&s;tians found a way to get leave to build a fair Church in <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar.</HI> But the next year the King caus'd it to be pull'd down, as al&s;o that of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Friars, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> made u&s;e of. The Pari&s;h Church, which was under the Government of the &s;ecular Prie&s;ts, &s;tood &s;till, till the <HI>Hollanders</HI> attack'd <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> and compell'd him to turn all the <HI>Portugals</HI> out of his Dominions. The ill conduct of that Prince was in part the occa&s;ion of that war: to which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were mov'd, to revenge them&s;elves upon the <HI>Portugal Je&s;uits,</HI> who had cro&s;s'd their Em|ba&s;&s;y to <HI>China.</HI> Be&s;ides, that they offer'd great affronts to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> e&s;pecially when they trod under foot the Hat of one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Envoys, who was &s;ent to treat with the King in behalf of the Company. There|upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> re&s;olv'd to unite their forces with the <HI>Bouquifes,</HI> that were in rebellion again&s;t their Soveraign, and to revenge them&s;elves at any rate.</P>
<P>Now as to the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>China,</HI> it happen'd thus: Toward the end of the year 1658, the General of <HI>Baravia</HI> and his Council, &s;ent one of the chief of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, with Pre&s;ents in the King of <HI>China;</HI> who arriving at Court, labour'd to gain the friend&s;hip of the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who are the Nobility of the Kingdom. But the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who by rea&s;on of their long abode in the Country, under&s;tood the language, and were acquainted with the Lords of the Court, le&s;t the <HI>Holland</HI> Company &s;hould get footing to the prejudice of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> repre&s;ented &s;everal things to the Kings Council to the prejudice of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> more e&s;pecially charging them with breach of Faith in all the places where they came. Upon this the <HI>Holland</HI> Agent was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and departed out of <HI>China,</HI> without doing any feats. Afterwards coming to under|&s;tand what a trick the <HI>Portugal Je&s;uits</HI> had put upon him, he made report thereof to the General and his Council at <HI>Batavia;</HI> which &s;o incens'd them, that they re&s;olv'd to be reveng'd. For by the Deputies accounts, the Em|ba&s;&s;y had co&s;t them above fifty thou&s;and Crowns; for which they con&s;ulted how to make the <HI>Portugals</HI> pay double. Under&s;tanding therefore the trade which the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> drove in the I&s;land of <HI>Macao,</HI> and to the Kingdom of <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ar,</HI> whither upon their own account they &s;ent &s;even Ve&s;&s;els, laden with all &s;orts of Commodities, as well of <HI>India</HI> as <HI>China;</HI> they took their opportunity, and the &s;eventh of <HI>June</HI> 1660, appear'd with a Fleet of thirty Sail before the Port of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar.</HI> The King thinking him&s;elf oblig'd to make defence again&s;t &s;o Potent an Enemy, endeavour'd to &s;u&s;tain the brunt of the <HI>Hollander</HI> with the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ships in the Road; but the <HI>Hollander</HI> dividing their Fleet, part of them fought the <HI>Portugal,</HI> the other half batter'd the Royal Fortre&s;s &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uriou&s;ly, that they carry'd it in a &s;hort time. Which &s;o terrifi'd the King that he commanded the <HI>Portugals</HI> not to fire any more for fear of farther pro|voking his Enemies. The Prince <HI>Patin&s;aloa,</HI> was &s;lain in the fight, which was a great lo&s;s to the King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> who was become formidable to his neigh|bours by the good Conduct of that Mini&s;ter. As for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they took, burnt, and &s;unk all the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ufficiently re-imburs'd them&s;elves for their <HI>China</HI> Expences.</P>
<P>The thirteenth of <HI>June</HI> the King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Sumbaco,</HI> hung out a white Flag from another Tower, whence he beheld the fight en|viron'd by his Wives. During the truce, he &s;ent one of the Grandees of his Court to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, to de&s;ire peace, which was granted, upon con|dition he &s;hould &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Batavia,</HI> expel the <HI>Portugals</HI> out of the I&s;land, and not permit his Subjects to have any more to do with them.</P>
<P>Thereupon the King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> &s;ent eleven of the greate&s;t Lords of his Court, with a train of &s;even hundred men; the Chief of the Emba&s;&s;y being
<PB N="193" REF="260">
the Prince of <HI>Patin&s;aloa.</HI> The fir&s;t thing they did, was to pay two hundred Loaves of Gold to redeem the Royal Fortre&s;s again; and then &s;ubmitting to the Con|ditions which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral had propos'd, the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> &s;ign'd the Articles, which are punctually ob&s;erv'd. For the <HI>Portugals</HI> had in all quitted the Country, &s;ome departing for <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Camboya,</HI> others for <HI>Macoa</HI> and <HI>Goa. Macoa,</HI> formerly one of the mo&s;t famous and riche&s;t Cities of the Orient, was the principal motive that enclin'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to &s;end an Em|ba&s;&s;adour into <HI>China;</HI> for being the be&s;t &s;tation which the <HI>Portugals</HI> had in all tho&s;e parts, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had a de&s;ign to win it wholly. Now, this City, lying in twenty-two Degrees of Northern Latitude, in a &s;mall I&s;land next to the Province of <HI>Kanton,</HI> which is a part of <HI>China,</HI> has very much lo&s;t its former lu&s;ter.</P>
<P>But this was not all which the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants &s;uffer'd. The Chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory at <HI>Mingrela,</HI> which is but eight Leagues from this City, under&s;tanding the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> had a contri|vance by him&s;elf to be reveng'd. He knew that the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> and other places, drove a great trade in rough Diamonds, which they &s;ent into <HI>Europe,</HI> or el&s;e carry'd along with them when they return'd; and that for the more private carrying on of their trade, they were wont to &s;end one or two of their Order, that knew the language, in the habit of a <HI>Faquir,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of a Tygers Skin to cover their back-parts, and a Goats Skin to cover the brea&s;t, reaching down to the knees. Thereupon the Chief of the Factory of <HI>Mingrela</HI> taking his opportunity, and having notice that two of the &s;uppos'd <HI>Faquirs</HI> were gone to the Mines, to lay out 400000 Pardo's in Diamonds, gave order to two men, which he had fee'd for the purpo&s;e, that as &s;oon as the Fathers had made their purcha&s;e, he &s;hould give notice to the Officer of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at <HI>Bicholi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bicholi</HI> is a great Town upon the Frontiers of tho&s;e Lands that part the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> from the Territories of the <HI>Portugals;</HI> there being no other way to pa&s;s the River, which encompa&s;&s;es the I&s;land where the City of <HI>Goa</HI> is built.</P>
<P>The Fathers believing that the Cu&s;tomer knew nothing of their purcha&s;e, went into the Boat to go over the River; but as &s;oon as they were in, they were &s;trictly &s;earch'd, and all their Diamonds confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>To return to the King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> you mu&s;t know, that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> once endeavour'd to convert him; and perhaps they might have brought it to pa&s;s, had they not neglected one propo&s;al which he made them. For at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> labour'd to bring him to Chri&s;tianity, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> us'd all their endeavours to oblige him to &s;tick to their Law. The King willing to leave his Idolatry, yet not knowing which part to take, commanded the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> to &s;end for two or three of their mo&s;t able <HI>Moulla's,</HI> or Doctors from <HI>Mecca;</HI> and the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> he order'd to &s;end him as many of the mo&s;t learn'd among them, that he might be in&s;tructed in both Religions; which they both promis'd to do. But the <HI>Mahometans</HI> were more diligent than the Chri&s;tians, for in eight months they fetch'd from <HI>Mecca</HI> two learned <HI>Moulla's;</HI> whereupon the King &s;eeing that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> &s;ent no body to him, embrac'd the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law. True it is, that three years after there came two <HI>Portugal Je&s;uits,</HI> but then it was too late.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> being thus become a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> the Prince his Bro|ther was &s;o mad at it, that when the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> which the King had caus'd to be built, was fini&s;h'd, he got into it one night, and cau&s;ing the throats of two Pigs to be cut, he all be&s;mear'd the Walls of the new <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> and the place which was appointed for the <HI>Moulla</HI> to perform Divine Service with the blood; &s;o that the King was forc'd to pull down that, and build Another. After which the Prince with &s;ome Idolatrous Lords &s;tole out of the I&s;land, and never &s;ince appear'd at Court.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Author pur&s;ues his Travels into the East, and embarks at <HI>Min|grela</HI> for <HI>Batavia.</HI> The danger he was in upon the Sea; and his arrival in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Departed from <HI>Mingrela,</HI> a great Town in the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> eight Leagues from <HI>Goa,</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>April,</HI> 1648, and embark'd in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Batavia.</HI> The Ship had orders to touch at <HI>Bokanour,</HI> to take in Rice. Whereupon I went a&s;hore with the Captain, to obtain leave of the King to buy Rice. We found him upon the &s;hore, where he had about a do|zen Huts &s;et up, which were cover'd with Palm-leaves. In his own Hut there was a piece of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tape&s;try &s;pread under him, and there we &s;aw five or &s;ix women, &s;ome fanning him with Peacocks Feathers, others giving him <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l&egrave;,</HI> others filling him his Pipe of Tobacco. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the Country were in the other Huts; and we counted about two hundred men that were upon the Guard, arm'd only with Bows and Arrows. They had al&s;o two Elephants among 'em. 'Tis very probable, that his Palace was not far off, and that he only came thither to take the fre&s;h air. There we were pre|&s;ented with <HI>Tari</HI> or Palm-wine; but being new, and not boil'd, it caus'd the head-ach in all that drank it, in&s;omuch that we were two days before we could recover it. I ask'd the rea&s;on, how the Wine came to do us &s;o much prejudice; to which they an&s;wer'd me, that it was the Planting of Pepper about the Palm|trees, that gave &s;uch a &s;trength to the Wine.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner got aboard, but a mighty tempe&s;t aro&s;e, wherein the Ship, men, and goods had all like to have been ca&s;t away, being near the &s;hore; but at length, the wind changing, we found our &s;elves by break of day three or four Leagues at Sea, having lo&s;t all our Anchors; and at length came &s;afe to Port in the Haven of <HI>Ponte de Galle,</HI> the twelfth of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>I found nothing remarkable in that City; there being nothing but the ruins made by the underminings and Cannon-&s;hot, when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> be&s;ieg'd it, and chas'd the <HI>Portugals</HI> from thence. The Company allow'd ground to build upon, to them that would inhabit there, and land to till; and had then rais'd two Bulwarks which commanded the Port. If they have fini&s;h'd the de&s;ign which they undertook, the place cannot but be very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> before they took all the places which the <HI>Portugals</HI> had in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> did believe that the trade of this I&s;land would have brought them in va&s;ts &s;ums, could they but be &s;ole Ma&s;ters of it; and perhaps their Conjectures might have been true, had they not broken their words with the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> who is the King of the Country; but breaking faith with him, they lo&s;t them&s;elves in all other places thereabouts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> had made an agreement with the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> that he &s;hould be always ready with twenty thou&s;and men, to keep the pa&s;&s;ages that hinder the <HI>Portugals</HI> from bringing any &s;uccours from <HI>Colombo, Negombe, Ma|nar,</HI> or any other places which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the Coa&s;t. In con|&s;ideration whereof the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> when they had taken <HI>Ponte Galle,</HI> were to re&s;tore it to the King of <HI>Candy;</HI> which they not performing, the King &s;ent to know why they did not give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town; to which they return'd an&s;wer, that they were ready to do it, provided he would defray the expences of the war. But they knew, that if he had had three Kingdoms more, &s;uch as his own, he could never have pay'd &s;o great a &s;um. I mu&s;t confe&s;s indeed the Country is very poor, for I do not believe that the King ever &s;aw fifty thou|&s;and Crowns together in his life; his Trade being all in Cinnamon and Elephants. As for his Cinnamon, he has no profit of it &s;ince the <HI>Portugals</HI> coming into the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> And for his Elephants, he makes but little of them; for they take not above five or &s;ix in a year; but they are more e&s;teem'd than any other Country Elephants, as being the mo&s;t couragious in war. One thing I
<PB N="195" REF="261">
will tell you hardly to be believ'd, but that which is a certain truth, which is, that when any other King or <HI>Raja</HI> has one of the&s;e Elephants of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> if they bring him among any other breed in any other place what&s;oever, &s;o &s;oon as the other Elephants behold the <HI>Ceylan</HI> Elephants, by an in&s;tinct of na|ture they do him reverence, laying their trunks upon the Ground, and rai&s;ing them up again.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Achen,</HI> with whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> al&s;o broke their word, had more opportunity to be reveng'd upon them then the King of <HI>Candy.</HI> For he deni'd them the tran&s;portation of Pepper out of his Country, without which their trade was worth little. His Pepper being that which is mo&s;t coveted by the Ea&s;t. So that they were forc'd to make a compo&s;ition with him. The King of <HI>Achens</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour coming to <HI>Batavia,</HI> was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee wo|men &s;itting at the Table; but much more, when after a health drank to the Queen of <HI>Achen,</HI> the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> commanded his Wife to go and ki&s;s the Emba&s;&s;adour. Nor was the King behind hand with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour another way; whom the King beholding in a langui&s;hing di&s;temper, ask'd him whether he had never any familiarity with any of the Natives. Yes, replied the Emba&s;&s;adour; however I left her to marry in my own Country. Upon that the King commanded three of his Phy&s;icians to cure him in fifteen days, upon the forfeiture of their lives. Thereupon they gave him a certain potion every morning, and a little Pill at night; and at the end of nine days he took a great Vomit. Every body thought he would have dy'd with the working of it; but at length brought up a &s;topple of cour&s;e hair, as big as a nut; after which he pre&s;ently recover'd. At his departure the King gave him a Flint about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e Egg, with veins of Gold in it, like the veins of a mans hand, as the Gold grows in that Country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Author goes to vi&s;it the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and relates &s;everal Adventures upon that occa&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>BEing &s;o ill treated in <HI>Batavia,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to vi&s;it the King of <HI>Bantam;</HI> to which purpo&s;e I took my own Brother along with me, becau&s;e he &s;poke the Language call'd <HI>Malaye;</HI> which in the Ea&s;t is as univer&s;al as <HI>Latin</HI> among us. Being arriv'd at <HI>Bantam</HI> in a &s;mall Bark, which we hir'd for our &s;elves; we went fir&s;t and vi&s;ited the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, who kindly entertain'd and lodg'd us.</P>
<P>The next day I &s;ent my Brother to the Palace, to know when it would be &s;ea&s;onable for me to come and ki&s;s the King's Hand. When the King &s;aw him (for he was well known to him) he would not &s;uffer him to return, but &s;ent others to fetch me, and to tell me withall, that if I had any rare Jewels, I &s;hould do him a kindne&s;s to bring them along with me.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw my Brother return'd not with the per&s;ons which the King &s;ent, I was almo&s;t in the mind not to have gone; remembring how the King of <HI>A|chen</HI> had &s;erv'd the Sieur <HI>Renaud.</HI> For the <HI>French</HI> having &s;et up an Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Company, &s;ent away four Ve&s;&s;els, three great ones, and one of eight Guns, for the &s;ervice of the Country. Their Voyage was the &s;horte&s;t that ever was heard of; arriving at <HI>Bantam</HI> in le&s;s than four months. The King al&s;o cour|teou&s;ly receiv'd them, and let them have as much Pepper as they de&s;ir'd, and cheaper by twenty in the hundred then he &s;old it to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But the <HI>French</HI> not coming only for Pepper, &s;ent away their &s;mall Ship with the greate&s;t part of their Money to <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> to try the Market for Cloves, Nut|megs, and Mace.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> being &s;o &s;oon di&s;patch'd at <HI>Bantam,</HI> had not patience to &s;tay till the return of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el which they had &s;ent to <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> but to pa&s;s the time, mu&s;t needs run over to <HI>Batavia,</HI> being not above fourteen Leagues off; &s;o that you may be at <HI>Batavia</HI> from <HI>Bantam</HI> in a tide with a good wind. When they came to an Anchor, the General of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;ent to Complement the General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who fail'd not to an&s;wer his ci|vility, and invited the Admiral a&s;hore. Moreover he &s;ent to tho&s;e that &s;tay'd aboard, great &s;tore of excellent chear, and a good quantity of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;h</HI> Wine, with particular order to them that carry'd it, to make the <HI>French</HI> drunk. His order was &s;o well follow'd, that 'twas ea&s;ie to &s;et the Ships on fire, according to the private in&s;tructions which they had. So &s;oon as the flame was di&s;cover'd from the Generals window, which overlook'd all the Road, there was a wonderful pretended a&s;toni&s;hment among the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But the <HI>French</HI> Ad|miral too truly conjecturing the ground and Authors of the treachery, behold|ing the company with an undaunted courage; Come, come, cry'd he, lets drink on; they that &s;et the Ships a-fire &s;hall pay for 'em. However the <HI>French</HI> Ships were all burnt, though the men were all &s;av'd in Boats which were forth|with &s;ent to their relief. After that, the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> made them great offers, which they refus'd, and return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> in expectation of their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el. When it return'd, they could find out no better way then to &s;ell Ship and goods, and all to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">are the Money among them&s;elves, every one according to their condition.</P>
<P>But the trick which they put upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was far more bloody. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were the fir&s;t that found out the danger of &s;ailing from <HI>Surat, Ma&s;li|patan,</HI> or any other di&s;tant parts, to <HI>Japon</HI> without touching by the way. Whereupon they thought it convenient to build a Fort in the I&s;land of <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> which not only &s;av'd the lo&s;s of &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, but al&s;o brought them in great gain. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> mad that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch an advantageous &s;cituation, being the only place in all the I&s;land where Ve&s;&s;els could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;afety; and finding they could not carry it by force, bethought
<PB N="197" REF="262">
them&s;elves of a Stratagem; to which purpo&s;e they &s;ent away two Ships, where|in they &s;tor'd the be&s;t of their Souldiers, who pretending they had been in a &s;torm in Sea, put into the Harbour of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> with &s;ome of their Ma&s;ts by the board, their Sails &s;catter'd, and their Seamen &s;eemingly &s;ick. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> compa&s;&s;ionating their mi&s;eries, which was only in outward appearance, invited the chief of them to come a&s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elves; which they were very ready to do, carrying as many men with them as po&s;&s;ibly they could under pretence of &s;ickne&s;s. While the chief of them were at Dinner with the chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they all ply'd their Cups; and when the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;aw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had drunk hard enough, taking their opportunity, they pickt a quar|rel with the Commander of the Fort, and drawing their Swords, which they had hidden under their Coats for that purpo&s;e, they ea&s;ily &s;urpriz'd and cut all the throats of the Soldiers in the Garri&s;on; and being thus Ma&s;ters of the Fort, they kept it from that time till they were routed out by the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the trick that the King of <HI>Achen</HI> &s;erv'd the Sieur <HI>Renaud;</HI> he ha|ving got a good E&s;tate by Jewels, arriv'd at length at <HI>Achen,</HI> and as it is the cu&s;tom for the Merchants to &s;hew the King what Jewels they have, the King had no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eye upon four Rings which the Sieur <HI>Renaud</HI> &s;hew'd him, but he bid him fifteen thou&s;and Crowns for them; but <HI>Renaud</HI> would not bate of eighteen thou&s;and. Now becau&s;e they could not agree, the Sieur <HI>Renaud</HI> carry'd them away with him, which very much di&s;pleas'd the King; however he &s;ent for him the next day. Whereupon <HI>Renaud</HI> returning to him, the King paid him his eighteen thou&s;and Crowns; but he was never &s;een after that, and it is thought he was &s;ecretly murther'd in the Palace.</P>
<P>This &s;tory came to my remembrance, when I found my Brother did not come along with tho&s;e that were &s;ent to fetch me,&punc; However I re&s;olv'd to go, taking with me 12 or 13000 Roupies worth of Jewels; the greate&s;t part be|ing in Ro&s;e Diamond Rings, &s;ome con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even, &s;ome of nine, and &s;ome of eleven Stones; with &s;ome &s;mall Bracelets of Diamonds and Rubies. I found the King with three of his Captains and my Brother &s;itting together, after the manner of the Ea&s;t, with five great Plates of Rice before them of divers colours. For their drink they had <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, &s;trong waters, and &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Sherbets.</HI> Af|ter I had complemented the King, and pre&s;ented him with a Diamond Ring, a blew Saphir Ring, and a little Bracelet of Diamonds, Rubies,, and blew Sa|phirs, he commanded me to &s;it down, and order'd me a gla&s;s of &s;trong Wa|ter to whet my appetite. The gla&s;s held a quarter of a pint, and therefore I refus'd it, which the King very much wonder'd at; but being told by my Bro|ther, that I never drank any &s;trong Water, he order'd me pre&s;ently a gla&s;s of Sack.</P>
<P>After that he ro&s;e up, and &s;eated him&s;elf in a Chair, the Elbows whereof were gilded. His feet and legs were bare, having a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpet of Gold and Silk to tread upon. He was clad with a piece of Calicut, part whereof cover'd his body from his wa&s;te to his knees, the re&s;t being wound about his back and &s;houlders like a Scarf. In&s;tead of Shoes he had a pair of Sandals, that &s;tood by the Chair &s;ide, the &s;traps whereof was embroider'd with Gold and &s;mall Pearl. About his head he had a thing like a Handkerchief, with three Corners, bound about his head like a Fillet. His hair al&s;o, which was very long, was twi&s;ted and ty'd together over his head. Two per&s;ons &s;tood behind him with great Fans of long Peacock Feathers, the handles whereof were five or &s;ix foot in length. Upon his right hand &s;tood an old black women, holding in her hand a little Mortar and Pe&s;tle of Gold, to beat his <HI>Betl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> in; where|with he mix'd the Kernel of the Nut of <HI>Araqu&egrave;,</HI> and Seed Pearl di&s;&s;olv'd. When it was all beaten together, the old woman gave it the King over his Shoulders, who opening his mouth, the old woman fed him as our women feed their Chil|dren. For the King had chaw'd &s;o much <HI>Betl&egrave;,</HI> and taken &s;o much Tobacco, that his teeth were all fall'n out of his head.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s Palace was never built by any curious Architect. It is a &s;quare place, encompa&s;s'd with a great many Pillars, varni&s;h'd over with &s;e|veral &s;orts of colours, again&s;t which the King leans when he &s;its down. At the four Corners there are four great Pillars &s;et in the earth, at forty foot di&s;tance
<PB N="198" REF="263">
the one from the other, lin'd with a Mat made of the Rhind of a certain Tree, &s;o thin that it looks like a piece of Linnen, which neither Fleas nor Punies will come near. The roof was cover'd with Coco-Branches. Not far off, under another Roof &s;upported with four great Pillars, he had &s;ixteen Elephants, the noble&s;t of all tho&s;e that are in the Kings &s;ervice: for he has a far greater num|ber train'd up for war, that are not afraid of wild-fire. For his guard he might have about two thou&s;and men, that were drawn up in Companies under the &s;hade of the next Trees. They are good Soldiers as well by Sea as by Land; great <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and &s;tand not at all in fear of death. His <HI>Haram,</HI> or the Womens Apartment, was certainly a very &s;mall Place. For when he had view'd what I brought him, he &s;ent for two old women, to whom he gave &s;ome of the Jewels, to go and &s;hew them to his Wives. The two women return'd back through a little pitiful door; the enclo&s;ure being nothing but a kind of Wall made up of Earth and Cow-dung mix'd together. Whatever he &s;ent to the Women, they never return'd any thing again. Which made me believe they would bear a good price; and indeed whatever I &s;old to him, I &s;old to good profit, and had my Money well paid me. After this we took our leaves; but the King oblig'd us to come next day in the evening, becau&s;e he had a de&s;ire to &s;hew us a <HI>Turky</HI> Dagger, the Haft whereof, being thin of Diamonds, he had a mind to enrich with more Stones. Coming to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e with our Money, they wonder'd that the King had laid out twenty thou&s;and Roupies, telling me, they believ'd it was the be&s;t part of his trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The next day my brother and I went to wait upon him at the appointed hour, and we found him &s;itting in the &s;ame place where he &s;ate before. There was a <HI>Moulla</HI> then read to him, who &s;eem'd to interpret to him &s;omething of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Language. The Lecture being ended, they both ro&s;e and went to prayers; which being concluded, the King &s;ent for the Dag|ger and the Haft which was of Gold. The top of the Handle was already &s;et with Diamonds, and upon the upper part of the cro&s;s Bar was cut in Fa|cets, which could not be le&s;s worth than fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Crowns. The King told me, it was pre&s;ented to him by the Queen of <HI>Borneo,</HI> and that it was cut at <HI>Goa;</HI> but that he put a far higher value upon it than I e&s;teem'd it to be worth. The Dagger, as well as the Sheath was full of Beazils, or Collets, in very good order; but the King had neither Diamond, Ruby, nor any other Stone to &s;et in the Collets; and therefore de&s;ir'd me to help him to &s;ome that might come at an ea&s;ie rate. I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible to find Stones that would fit the Beazils; and therefore that it was better, when he had got Stones enough, to fix other Beazils according to the proportion of the Stones. To which purpo&s;e he was fir&s;t to range all his Stones in Wax; which I &s;hew'd him how to do at the &s;ame time; but that was above his skill. And therefore do what I could to excu&s;e my &s;elf to the contrary, he would needs oblige me to carry the Dagger to <HI>Batavia;</HI> whereupon I took my leave of the King, and departed.</P>

<P>ABout elev'n a Clock at night, we embark'd for <HI>Batavia;</HI> for the night winds blowing from the Land, are the only winds to &s;erve our turn; &s;o that we were at <HI>Batavia</HI> between ten and elev'n the next morning. There I &s;tay'd twenty days for the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s &s;ake, to make him belive I had &s;ought for that which I knew was impo&s;&s;ible to be found. I had nothing to do all the while, for in <HI>Batavia</HI> there is no other recreation than gaming and drinking, which was none of my bu&s;ine&s;s. At that time the Sieur <HI>Cant</HI> dy'd, one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Coun&s;ellors, who was &s;umptuou&s;ly buri'd for his good &s;ervices done to the Company; but the people complain'd heavily of the in|ju&s;tice which he had done as well to the Souldiers as Mariners.</P>
<P>Having &s;tay'd twenty days at <HI>Bantam,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to go and return the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> his Dagger again; for it was impo&s;&s;ible to meet with &s;tones to fit his Beazils. However I took along with me &s;ome other Stones which he had not &s;een. Coming to <HI>Bantam,</HI> the King caus'd us to be lodg'd in one of his own Hou&s;es in the City, which was made of <HI>Bamboo's.</HI> Thither in le&s;s then a quarter of an hour, the King &s;ent us &s;ome Pateches, or &s;weet Water-Melons, red within like Scarlet. We had al&s;o Mongo's, and a certain large Fruit call'd <HI>Pompone,</HI> red al&s;o within, the meat of it being &s;oft and &s;pungy, but of an excellent ta&s;te&punc; Having &s;tay'd our &s;tomachs, we went to wait upon the King, whom we found in the &s;ame place, with his old Mortar-bearer, who every foot fed him with <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> with her fingers. There were &s;itting about the Hall five or &s;ix of his Captains, viewing a certain parcel of Fire-works, as Gra|nado's, Rochets, and other divices to run upon the water, which the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> had brought; who are the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite at tho&s;e &s;ports of any people in the world. When the King was at lea&s;ure, I return'd him his Dagger, tel|ling him, that <HI>Batavia</HI> was no place to meet with &s;tones; and that &s;uch as were to be found, were valu'd at double the price they were worth; and that there was no place where he could fit him&s;elf, but at <HI>Golconda, Goa,</HI> or the Diamond Mines. Thereupon the old woman took the Dagger, and carry'd it in|to his <HI>Haram;</HI> nor did the King &s;peak one word more about it. After that I &s;hew'd him what other &s;tones I had brought, a percel whereof I &s;old him to good profit; the King ordering us to come the next day for payment.</P>
<P>The next day about &s;ix a Clock in the morning, my Brother and I, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Chirurgion, were going along a narrow way, between a River on the one hand, and the Pales of a great Garden on the other. Behind the Pales a Ra&s;cally <HI>Bantamois,</HI> had hid him&s;elf; one of tho&s;e that was newly come from <HI>Mecca,</HI> and was upon the de&s;ign <HI>Moqua;</HI> that is, in their Language, when the Ra&s;cality of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> return from <HI>Mecca,</HI> they pre&s;ently take their <HI>Cric</HI> in their hands, which is a kind of Poniard, the Blade whereof is half poy&s;on'd; with which they run through the &s;treets, and kill all tho&s;e which are not of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law, till they be kill'd them&s;elves. The&s;e Furies think that in &s;o doing they do God and <HI>Mahomet</HI> good &s;ervice, and &s;hall be &s;av'd thereby. If any of the&s;e madmen be kill'd, the Rabble of <HI>Mahumetans</HI> buries them as Saints, and every one contributes to make a fair Tomb. Sometimes you &s;hall have an idle Rogue, in the habit of a <HI>Dervich,</HI> that will build him a Hut near the Tomb, which he undertakes to look to, and &s;trew with Flowers. And as his alms increa&s;e, he adds &s;ome other ornament to it. For the Fairer and better &s;et out the Tomb is, the more devoutly it is wor|&s;hip'd, and the more Alms it brings in. I remember in theyear 1642, that at <HI>Souali,</HI> which is the Port of <HI>Surat,</HI> it happen'd that a Ve&s;&s;el of the great <HI>Moguls</HI> return'd from <HI>Mecca,</HI> with a great number of <HI>Faquirs</HI> or <HI>Derviches.</HI> For
<PB N="200" REF="264">
every year the King &s;ends two Ve&s;&s;els to carry and bring back the Pilgrims, who have their pa&s;&s;age free. And when the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are to go, the <HI>Faquirs</HI> come from all parts of <HI>India</HI> to embark. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are lad'n with very good Commodities, which are &s;old at <HI>Mecca,</HI> and the profit is di&s;tributed among the poor Pilgrims. But the principal is brought back for the next year, amounting to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Roupies at lea&s;t. 'Tis an ill Market when they do not gain 30 or 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> by their Commodities; nay there are &s;ome that produce <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> be&s;ides, that the principal per&s;ons of the <HI>Moguls Haram,</HI> and other particular per&s;ons, &s;end very large gifts to <HI>Mecca.</HI></P>
<P>One of the&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> returning from <HI>Mecca</HI> in the year 1642, and being landed at <HI>Souali,</HI> had no &s;ooner &s;aid his prayers, but he took his Dagger, and ran among &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Mariners that were unlading goods upon the &s;hore, and before they were aware this mad&punc; <HI>Faquir</HI> had wounded &s;eventeen of them, of which thirteen dy'd. The <HI>Canjare</HI> which he had in his hand, was a kind of Dagger, the Blade whereof toward the Handle was three fingers broad; and becau&s;e it is a very dangerous weapon, I have here given you the Figure of it.</P>

At length the Sentinel that &s;tood at the entry of the Tent where the Gover|nour and Merchants were, &s;hot him through the body, &s;o that he fell down dead. Immediately all the other <HI>Faquirs</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans</HI> that were upon the place took up the body and buried it: and at the end of fifteen days they put him up a fair Monument. Every year the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> pull it down; but when they are gone, the <HI>Faquirs</HI> &s;et it up again, and plant Banners over it; nay &s;ome there are that perform their devotions to it.</P>

The <HI>Dutch</HI> man being next the River, and &s;omewhat be|fore the re&s;t, the head of his Pike ran into his Breeches; whereupon we both laid hold of the Staff.

<P>The next day, coming to take my leave of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, he &s;hew'd me two &s;trings of Diamonds, and two Services of Silver, which came from <HI>England.</HI> He would have &s;old them all, but I only bought one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;trings of Diamonds, the other being foul; and for the Silver, I would have bought it, had they coin'd Silver in <HI>Batavia,</HI> as they were wont to do. Formerly the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> coin'd Reals, Half-Reals, and Quarter-Reals, bearing on the one &s;ide the &s;tamp of a Ship, on the other V, O, C, like a Character, as in the Figure, &s;ignifying in <HI>Dutch, Vor Ost Indian, Compagnie,</HI> for the Ea&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Company. Which they did for the Sake of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who loving Silver better than Gold, carri'd away all the Silver that was coin'd at <HI>Batavia,</HI> at good rates. But at length they left it off, finding &s;o few people that made u&s;e of Silver.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the War of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with the Emperor of <HI>Java.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving taken my leave of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident, I return'd to <HI>Batavia;</HI> where having little to do, I re&s;olv'd to give a vi&s;it to the King of <HI>Japar,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd the Emperor of <HI>Java.</HI> This King was formerly King of all the I&s;land, till the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> who was only Governour of a Province, rebell'd again&s;t him; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being made by the divi&s;ions of tho&s;e two Princes. For when the King of <HI>Japar</HI> be&s;ieg'd <HI>Batavia,</HI> the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> reliev'd the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and when they were attack'd by the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> the King of <HI>Japar</HI> came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And when tho&s;e two Kings were together by the ears, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> always aided the weake&s;t.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Japar</HI> keeps his Court in a City of the &s;ame name, di&s;tant from <HI>Batavia</HI> &s;ome thirty Leagues. You may co&s;t along the &s;hore to it by Sea; but the City &s;tands above eight Leagues up in the Land. From the City there is a fine Walk to the Sea, where there is a hand&s;om Port, and fairer Hou&s;es than any in the City. And the King would live there if he thought it &s;afe.</P>
<P>The day before I departed, I went to take my leave of one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Coun&s;ellors, and telling him that I was going to wait upon the King of <HI>Japar,</HI> he &s;tood amaz'd, in regard the King and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were mortal Enemies; of which he gave me this account: The deceas'd King, Father to the King that now reigns, &s;ince the <HI>Hollanders</HI> built their Fort of <HI>Batavia</HI> would never have any peace with them. And though that during the war the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took ten of his Subjects, for one of theirs, and offer'd ten for one in exchange, yet he would never exchange one upon any condition what&s;oever, and charg'd, his Son upon his death-bed never to relea&s;e one. This ob&s;tinacy very much trou|bl'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> General, and all the re&s;t in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and oblig'd them to con|&s;ult upon ways how to right them&s;elves. Now it is the cu&s;tom when a <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> King dyes, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;ends certain great Lords of his Court to <HI>Mecca</HI> with Pre&s;ents, as well to engage them to pray for the Soul of the deceas'd; as al&s;o to give thanks to God and <HI>Mahomet</HI> for the coming of a new King to the Throne without any Impediment; and to pray for the ble&s;&s;ing of victory over all his Enemies. But the new King and his Council were at a lo&s;s how to accompli&s;h this Voyage; for fir&s;t the King had none but little Ve&s;&s;els, that were wont only to &s;ail along by the &s;hore, by rea&s;on of the in|experience of his Seamen; and in the &s;econd place the <HI>Dutch</HI> were always ply|ing to and fro about the mouths of his Havens, to &s;urprize his Subjects if they &s;tirr'd forth. For the &s;afety therefore of his Pilgrims, the King at la&s;t Con|cludes upon making an agreement with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For which rea&s;on he di&s;|patches away an Envoy to <HI>Bantam,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident and his Council&punc; who promis'd to len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> him the bigge&s;t Ve&s;&s;el and the be&s;t mounted which the com|pany had in the <HI>Indies.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> whereof the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were to pay but half Cu&s;toms for ever, for all Commodities exported or imported out of his Country. Which Treaty being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> furni&s;h'd him with three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">out Ve&s;&s;els, Mann'd and Gunn'd beyond an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> rate. Thereupon nine of the principal Lords of the Court, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> Blood Royal, with a Train of a hundred per&s;ons, embark'd them&s;elves in the great Ve&s;&s;el. But all the&s;e preparations could not be carri'd &s;o privately, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> the <HI>Dutch</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of it by their Spies. Thereupon the General of the <HI>Dutch</HI> makes ready three Ships, and lying ju&s;t in the &s;treight of <HI>Bantams</HI> mouth; &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came up, (for they had no other way) let fly at them &s;o roundly, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fearing le&s;t their Ve&s;&s;els would be &s;unk, &s;truck Sail; which the <HI>Java</HI> Lords &s;eeing, call'd the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> Traytors, and drawing their poy&s;on'd Daggers, cry'd <HI>a Mocca</HI> upon the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> killing a great number of them before they had time to put them&s;elves into a po&s;ture of defence. And perhaps there would not one of them have e&s;cap'd, had not the <HI>Hollanders</HI> come aboard as they did. Some of the <HI>Java</HI> Lords, and about
<PB N="203" REF="265">
twenty of their Attendants, would take no quarter; &s;o that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were forc'd to fight for't, and at la&s;t they got the better, with the lo&s;s of &s;even or eight men. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el being carri'd into <HI>Batavia,</HI> the General very ci|villy &s;ent both the Pri&s;oners and the Ve&s;&s;el home again; withall giving notice to the King, that he was ready to make an exchange of Pri&s;oners with him. But the King would not &s;o much as hearken to any &s;uch propo&s;ition; returning for an&s;wer, that though the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had three times as many of his Sub|jects he would not relea&s;e &s;o much as one <HI>Hollander.</HI> So that the poor <HI>Dutch</HI> were kept &s;laves in <HI>Java,</HI> and the <HI>Javanners</HI> dy'd ini&s;erable in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Javanners,</HI> they are good Souldiers. And it is reported, that while <HI>Batavia</HI> was be&s;ieg'd by the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> in the year 1659, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Soul|dier lying in Ambu&s;cade in a Mar&s;h, a <HI>Javanner,</HI> little dreaming, that any body had been there, came to the &s;ame place to di&s;cover the Enemy, and was by the <HI>Dutch</HI> man thru&s;t with his Pike into his Body. Upon which the <HI>Javanner</HI> find|ing him&s;elf wounded, did not &s;trive to pull the Pike out of the body, but thru&s;t him&s;elf farther upon it, to the end he might come at his Enemy, whom he &s;tab'd to the heart, as &s;oon as he got within his reach.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Author buries his Brother; and is again quarrel'd withall by the General and his Council.</HEAD>
<P>WHile I &s;tay'd at <HI>Batavia,</HI> my Brother dy'd; and it was pretty to con|&s;ider what the <HI>Dutch</HI> made me pay for his Funeral. The fir&s;t expence is for the Feet of tho&s;e that beg leave for the Corps to be buri'd of whom the more there are, the more honourable the Funeral is e&s;teem'd, I &s;ent &s;ix, and paid them to my wonder for that &s;eventy-two Crowns. The fee for the Pall is a right that belongs to the poor, for which I paid two Crowns. There was a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine drank out, that co&s;t me two hundred Pia&s;ters. I gave twenty-&s;ix more for three <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> Hams, and &s;ome Neats-tongues, and twenty-two for Bak'd Meats. To the Bearers I gave twenty Crowns, and &s;ix|teen for a place in the Church-yard, for they ask'd me a hundred to bury him in the Church. And all the&s;e are Fee's demanded. So that my Brothers Funeral co&s;t me twelve hundred and twenty three Livres of <HI>French</HI> Mo|ney.</P>
<P>Being thus put by the two Voyages which I intended to <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> I was advis'd to lay out my Money in <HI>Requenings</HI> or <HI>Debentures</HI> of the Servants of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company; which they that have no mind to return into their own Country, as being &s;ettled in the <HI>Indies,</HI> will &s;ell at an ea&s;ie rate; in&s;omuch, that for &s;ixty or &s;eventy you may buy a hundred Pai&s;ters; the Act and Ac|quittance of the Seller being made and regi&s;ter'd by the Publick Notary. There|upon I bought of one of the publick Notaries, who had Bills in his hands, to the value of about eleven thou&s;and Guelders, at four&s;core and two for the hun|dred. After that, I bought by means of the Advocate of the Trea&s;ury, &s;ix thou&s;and Guelders more, at &s;eventy-nine for the hundred. But &s;ome few days after, meeting with the &s;ame Advocate again, he pa&s;s'd a Complement upon me, and told me, he was very much troubl'd for tho&s;e that had bought De|bentures, in regard that the General and the Council had commanded him to recall all Debentures that had been &s;old; for they had con&s;ider'd, how &s;ad a thing it would be, for the poor men to loo&s;e &s;o much of their Salaries. I an|&s;wer'd him, that for my part I was willing to return mine, provided I might have my Money again. About &s;ix or &s;even hours after, I was &s;ent for by the General and his Council. When I came there, they ask'd me why I had not re|turn'd the Debentures. which I had bought. to the Advocate, who had demand|ed them by their order. I an&s;wer'd them, that they were at <HI>Bantam,</HI> whither
<PB N="204" REF="266">
I had &s;ent them in order to my pa&s;&s;age home; in regard that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre|&s;ident had offer'd me a convenience to go along with him. The Council an|&s;wer'd me, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were as good as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and very cour|teou&s;ly a&s;&s;ur'd me, they would give order for a Cabin to my &s;elf in the Vice-Admiral. But withall they told me, I mu&s;t deliver up my Debentures before I &s;tirr'd; a&s;&s;uring me, that they would give me a Bill to be re-imburs'd my Mo|ney by the Company in <HI>Holland.</HI> I thought it very hard, for I knew not how to tru&s;t 'em; but &s;eeing the Merchants, Commanders, and all other per&s;ons clapt up, and their Papers taken from them by force, that had bought De|bentures; I thought it the be&s;t way to deliver mine, and &s;tand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> their cour|te&s;ie. I often pre&s;s'd the General and the Council for my Bill, but after ma|ny delays the General a&s;certain'd me, that my Bill &s;hould be in <HI>Holland</HI> as &s;oon as I. Thereupon de&s;iring the Vice-Admiral and &s;ome others to be my witne&s;&s;es of what the General promis'd, I took my leave of him, very much repenting my going to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Author embarks in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, to return into <HI>Europe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next day I went aboard the Vice admiral, and the third day after we &s;et &s;ail, and as &s;oon as we were out of the Streight, we di&s;cover'd the I&s;lands of the Prince. From thence being in the Altitude of the <HI>Coco</HI> I&s;lands, we beat about two days to di&s;cover them; but all to no purpo&s;e, thereupon we made directly for the <HI>Cape of good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>The forty-fifth day after our departure from <HI>Batavia,</HI> our Vice-Admiral neglected to put out his Lights; believing all the Fleet had been before at the <HI>Cape;</HI> &s;o that it happen'd that one of the Fleet being behind, and not carry|ing any Lights out neither, it being a dark night, fell &s;oul upon us, which put every man to his prayers, all people believing the Ve&s;&s;el had been lo&s;t; and indeed had &s;he not been a &s;ound &s;tanch Ship (for the <HI>Provinces</HI> were &s;o ac|counted) &s;he &s;hould never have endur'd &s;o terrible a &s;hock. At length we clear'd our &s;elves, by cutting of the Yards of the <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> that hung in our Cor|dage.</P>
<P>The fifty-fifth we came within view of the <HI>Cape of good Hope;</HI> but were forc'd to keep the Sea, becau&s;e the waves roll'd &s;o that we were not able to come to an Anchor; not that the Wind was extream high, but becau&s;e the South|wind had blown &s;o long that it had forc'd the Water to that part. When the Sea grew calm, we came to an Anchor.</P>
<P>But of all the people that ever I &s;aw in all my travels I never &s;aw any &s;o hideous nor &s;o bruit&s;h as the <HI>Comoukes,</HI> of which I had &s;poken in my <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Travels; and tho&s;e of the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> whom they call <HI>Cafres,</HI> or <HI>Ho|&s;entotes.</HI> When they &s;peak, they make anoi&s;e with their tongues, like the breaking of wind backward; and though they hardly &s;peak articulately, yet they ea&s;ily, under&s;tand one another. They cover them&s;elves with the Skins of wild Bea&s;ts, which they kill in the Woods; in Winter wearing the hairy part inner|mo&s;t, and in Summer outermo&s;t. But there are none but the be&s;t &s;ort among them who are thus clad, the re&s;t wear nothing but a na&s;ty rag about their privy parts. The men and the women are lean and &s;hort; and when they bring forth a Male-child, the Mothers cut out his right Stone; and pre&s;ently give him Water to drink, and Tobacco to eat. They cut out the right Te&s;ticle, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, it makes them &s;wifter to run. There are &s;ome of them that will catch a Roe-Buck runnig: They neither know what belongs to Gold nor Silver; and for Religion, they have none among them.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we ca&s;t Anchor, four women came aboard us, and brought us four young O&s;triches; which were boil'd for &s;ome &s;ick people that we had a|board.
<PB N="205" REF="266">
After that they brought great &s;tore of Tortoi&s;e-Shells, and O&s;triches Eggs, and other Eggs as big as Goo&s;e Eggs; which though they had no Yolk, ta&s;ted wery well. The Birds that lay the&s;e Eggs are a &s;ort of Gee&s;e; and &s;o fat that they are hardly to be eaten, ta&s;ting rather like Fi&s;h than Fle&s;h. The wo|men &s;eeing our Cook throw away the Guts of two or three Fowl which he was dre&s;&s;ing, took them up, and &s;queezing out the Ordure, eat them as they were; being hugely pleas'd with the <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> which the Captain gave them. Nei|ther men nor women are a&s;ham'd to &s;hew their nakedne&s;s, for indeed they are but a &s;ort of human Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Ship arrives, they bring their Beeves to the &s;hore, with what other Commodities they have, to barter for &s;trong Water and Tobacco, Cry|&s;tal or Agat Beads; or any &s;ort of old Iron work. If they are not &s;atisfi'd with what you offer them, away they fly; and then giving a whi&s;tle all their Cat|tel follow 'em; nor &s;hall you ever &s;ee 'em again. Some, when they &s;aw 'em fly, would &s;hoot and kill their Cattel; but after that for &s;ome years they would never bring any more. 'Tis a very great convenience for the Ve&s;&s;els that touch there, to take in fre&s;h Victals; and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did well to build a Fort there. It is now a good hand&s;om Town, inhabited by all &s;orts, that live with the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and all &s;orts of Grain, which are brought out of <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and &s;ow'd there, come to better perfection there then in other parts. The Coun|try lies in thirty-five Degrees, and &s;ome few Minutes over, &s;o that it cannot be &s;aid that either the heat or &s;cituation of the Climate makes the&s;e <HI>Cafres</HI> &s;o black. Being de&s;irous to know the rea&s;on, and why they &s;tunk &s;o terribly, I learnt it from a Girl that was bred up in the Fort, who was tak'n from her Mother, as &s;oon as &s;he was born, and was white like our women in <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;he told me, that the rea&s;on why the <HI>Cafres</HI> are &s;o black is, becau&s;e they rub them&s;elves with a Grea&s;e or Ointment compos'd of &s;everal &s;orts of Drugs; wherewith &s;hould they not anoint them&s;elves very often, and as &s;oon as they were born, they &s;hould be|come Hydrop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ical, as the Blacks of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> are; or like the people of <HI>Saba,</HI> that never live above forty years, and are always troubl'd with one Leg twice as big as the other. The&s;e <HI>Cafres,</HI> as bruiti&s;h as they are, have yet &s;ome knowledge of Simples, which they know to apply to &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es; which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have &s;everal times experienc'd. Of nineteen &s;ick per&s;ons that we had in our Ship, fifteen were committed to the care of the&s;e <HI>Cafres,</HI> being troubl'd with Ulcers in their Legs, and old wounds which they had re|ceiv'd in the wars; and in le&s;s then fifteen days they were all perfectly cur'd. Every one of the&s;e had two <HI>Cafres</HI> to look after him; and according to the con|dition of the wound or Ulcer, they went and fetch'd Simples, which they bruis'd between two Stones, and apply'd to the &s;ore. As for the other four, they were &s;o far gone with the Pox, that they would not tru&s;t the <HI>Cafres</HI> with them, having been given over at <HI>Batavia,</HI> and &s;o they all dy'd, between the <HI>Cape</HI> and St. <HI>He|lens.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1661, a Gentleman of <HI>Britanny</HI> being at <HI>Batavia,</HI> was &s;o bit by the Gnats in the night, that his Leg exulcerated pre&s;ently in &s;uch a manner, as to puzzle all the art and skill of the Chirurgeons in that Town. When he came to the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> the Captain of the Ship &s;ending him a &s;hore, the <HI>Cafres</HI> came about him, and after they had beheld him, they told him if he would tru&s;t to them they would cure him. The Captain thereupon committed him to their care, who cur'd him and made him a &s;ound man in le&s;s then fifteen days.</P>
<P>When a Ship comes to an Anchor in the <HI>Cape,</HI> it is the fa&s;hion for him that commands the Ship, to give leave to &s;ome part of the Mariners and Souldiers to go a&s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elves. The &s;ickly have fir&s;t leave by turns, and go to the Town, where they are dyeted and lodg'd for &s;even or eight Sous a day, and are very well us'd.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> when they &s;tay here, to &s;end out parties of Souldiers upon the di&s;covery of the up-land Country, and they that go farthe&s;t are be&s;t rewaaded. With this de&s;ign a party of Souldiers, under the Command of a Serjant&punc; far advanc'd in the Country; and night coming on, they made a great fire, as well to keep them&s;elves from the Lions, as to warm them &s;elves, and &s;o lay down to &s;leep round about it&punc; Being a&s;leep, a Lion came and &s;eiz'd
<PB N="206" REF="267">
one of the Souldiers Arms, which the Serjant perceiving, immediately &s;hot the Lion with his Carbine; but when he was dead, they had much ado to open the Lions mouth, to get out the Souldiers Arm. Thus it appears a vulgar error, to believe that Lions would not come near the fire. As for the Souldier, the <HI>Ca|fres</HI> cur'd his Arm in twelve days. There are in the Fort abundance of Lions and Tigers Skins; among the re&s;t, there was the Skin of a Hor&s;e which the <HI>Ca|fres</HI> had kill'd; it was white, cro&s;s'd with black &s;treaks, &s;potted like a Leopard, without a Tail. Two or three Leagues from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fort, there was a Lion found dead, with four Porcupines Qills in his body, the third part were|of had pierc'd his fle&s;h. So that it was judg'd that the Porcupine had kill'd the Lion. The Skin, with the Quills in it, is kept in the Fort.</P>
<P>A League from the Fort, is a fair Town, that grows bigger and bigger every day. When the <HI>Holland</HI> Company arrives there with their Ships, if any Soul|dier or Mariner will live there, they are very glad of it. They have as much ground as they can mannage; where they have all &s;orts of Herbs, and Pul&s;e, and as much Rice, and as many grapes as they can de&s;ire. They have al&s;o young O&s;tridges, Beef Sea-fi&s;h, and &s;weet water. To catch the O&s;tridges, when they plea&s;e, they got their Ne&s;ts when they were young, and driving a &s;take in the ground, tye the Birds by one Leg to the &s;take, and when they are old enough they come and take them out of the Ne&s;t, from whence it is impo&s;&s;ible to fly away.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Hollanders</HI> began to inhabit the <HI>Cape,</HI> they took a young Girl from her Mother, as &s;oon as &s;he was born; &s;he is white, only her No&s;e is a little flat. A <HI>French</HI> man got her with Child, and would have marry'd her; but the Com|pany were &s;o far from permitting him, that they took away above a hundred Livres of the Maids wages from her, to puni&s;h her for the mi&s;demeanour, which was &s;omewhat hard.</P>
<P>There are great numbers of Lions and Tigers, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have a pretty invention to take; they fa&s;ten a Carbine to a &s;take, driv'n into the Earth, and lay meat round about the Gun, which meat is fa&s;ten'd with a &s;tring to the Trigger. So that when the Bea&s;t &s;natches the meat, the String pulls the Trig|ger, and the Gun going off, hits the Lion either in the throat or the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cafres</HI> feed upon a Root like our Skerrets, which they ro&s;t and make bread of. Sometimes they grind it into flower, and then it ta&s;ts like a Wal|nut. For their food they eat the &s;ame Root raw, with raw Fi&s;h; with the En|trails of Bea&s;ts, out of which they only &s;queeze the ordure. As for the bowels of the wild Bea&s;ts, the women wear them dry'd about their Legs, e&s;pecially the bowels of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts which their Husbands kill, which they look upon as a kind of Ornament. They al&s;o feed upon Tortoi&s;es, when they have &s;o far heat|ed them at the fire, as to make the Shells come off. They are very expert in darting their <HI>Azagaya's;</HI> and tho&s;e that have none, make u&s;e of pointed &s;ticks, which they will lance a great way. With the&s;e they go down to the Sea-&s;ide, and as &s;oon as ever they &s;py a Fi&s;h near the top of the water, they will not fail to &s;trike him.</P>
<P>As for their Birds, which are like our Ducks, who&s;e Eggs are without any Yolk; they breed in &s;uch great quantities in the Country, that in a Bay about eighteen Miles from the <HI>Cape,</HI> you may knock them on the head with a &s;tick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> once carri'd a young <HI>Cafre</HI> to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> who bred him carefully up, teaching him to under&s;tand the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Lan|guages perfectly well. At length being de&s;irous to return into his Country, the General gave him very good Cloaths, and good Linnen, hoping that he would have liv'd among the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and been &s;erviceable to them in the dicovery of the Country; but &s;o &s;oon as he got home, he flung his Cloaths i' the Sea, and return'd wild among his fellow Natives, eating raw fle&s;h as he did before, and quite for|getting his Benefactors.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Cafres</HI> go a hunting, they go a great number together, and make &s;uch a prodigious howling and yelling, that they fright the very Bea&s;ts them|&s;elves, and in that affright with ea&s;e de&s;troy them; and I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, that their cries do terrfie the Lions them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The women are of &s;o hot a Con&s;titution of Body, that at the times that their
<PB N="207" REF="267">
monthly cu&s;toms are upon 'em, they happen to make water, and that <HI>Euro|pean</HI> chances to &s;et his feet upon it, it cau&s;es an immediate Head-ach and Fea|ver, which many times turns to the Plague.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet arrives at St. <HI>Helens.</HI> The di&s;cription of the I&s;land&punc;</HEAD>
<P>HAving &s;taid two and twenty dayes at the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> &s;eeing that the Wind was favourable, we weigh'd, and &s;teer'd for St. <HI>Helens.</HI> When we were under Sail, the Mariners cry'd out, they would &s;leep till they came into St. <HI>Helens</HI> Road. For the wind is very con&s;tant, and carries you in &s;ixteen or eighteen days to the Road of the I&s;land. All the trouble that our Mariners had, was that fourteen days after our departure from the <HI>Cape,</HI> they were often forc'd to the Top-Ma&s;t head, upon di&s;covery of the I&s;land; for as &s;oon as you di&s;cover the I&s;land, the Pilot mu&s;t take care to &s;teer to the Noth-&s;ide of the I&s;land, be|cau&s;e there is no ca&s;ting Anchor but on that &s;ide, and that very near the &s;hore too; by rea&s;on of the deepne&s;s of the water; for if the Anchors come not to take hold, the current of the water and the wind carries the Ship quite out of the Road, which there is no recovering again, becau&s;e the wind never changes.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Ships came to an Anchor, part of the Seamen were &s;ent a&s;hore to get wild Hogs, of which there are great plenty; and to gather Sorrel, which grows in great abundance; and indeed they not only &s;end the Seamen, but all the Pigs, Sheep, Gee&s;e, Ducks, and Pullets aboard, to feed upon that Sorrel, which pur|ges them in &s;uch a manner, that in a few days they became &s;o fat, that by that time we came to <HI>Holland</HI> they were hardly to be eaten. That Sorrel has the &s;ame operation upon the men, who boiling their wild Swines fle&s;h, Rice, and Sorrel to|gether, make thereof a kind of Potage &s;o excellent, that it keeps their bodies open by an in&s;en&s;ible purgation.</P>
<P>There are two places upon the Coa&s;t of St. <HI>Helens</HI> where Ships may come to an Anchor. But the be&s;t is that where we lay, by rea&s;on that ground is very good, and for that the water that falls from the Mountain is the be&s;t in the I&s;land. In this part of the I&s;land there is no plain, for the Mountain de&s;cends to the very &s;hore of the Sea.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o good anchoring in the other Road; but there is a very hand&s;ome plain, where you may &s;ow or plant whatever you plea&s;e. There are great &s;tore of Citrons, and &s;ome Oranges, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> had formerly planted there. For that Nation has that vertue, that whereever they come, they make the place the better for tho&s;e that come after them; whereas the <HI>Hollanders</HI> endeavour to de&s;troy all things wherever they &s;et footing. I confe&s;s the Commanders are not of that humour, but the Sea-men and Souldiers, who cry one to another, we &s;hall never come hither any more, and out of greedine&s;s will cut down a whole tree in&s;tead of gathering the fruit.</P>
<P>Some days after there arriv'd a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Guiny,</HI> full of Slaves, which were bound for the Mines of <HI>Peru.</HI> Some of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that under&s;tood the language of the <HI>Negro's,</HI> tol'd 'em how mi&s;erably they would be us'd, and thereupon the next night two hundred and fifty of them threw them&s;elves into the Sea. And indeed it is a mi&s;erable &s;lavery; for &s;ometimes after they have min'd in &s;ome places for &s;ome days together, the Earth being loo&s;e, falls down and kills four or five hunder'd at a time. Be&s;ides, that after they had been mining awhile, their Faces, their Eyes, and their Skins change colour; which proceeds from the vapours that ari&s;e from tho&s;e concavities; nor could they &s;ub&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e places, but for the quantity of &s;trong Water which they give both to the men and wo|men. There are &s;ome that are made free by their Ma&s;ters, who labour however for their living; but between Saturday night and Munday morning they &s;pend all their weeks wages in &s;trong Water, which is very dear; &s;o that they always live mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>Being ready to depart the I&s;land of St. <HI>Helens,</HI> the Admiral call'd a Council, to advize which way to &s;teer. The greate&s;t part were for &s;teering more to the We&s;t,
<PB N="208" REF="268">
then to the South; becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on for &s;ailing was far &s;pent; and for that if we &s;teer'd for the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> we &s;hould find the wind more proper to carry us into <HI>Holland.</HI> But we had no &s;ooner cro&s;s'd the Line, but we found the wind quite con|trary to what the Mariners expected; &s;o that we were forc'd to &s;teer to the &s;ixty-forth Degree of Altitude with the I&s;land, and &s;o return by the North into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet &s;ets Sail from St. <HI>Helens,</HI> and pro&s;perou&s;ly ar|rives in <HI>Holland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next day after the Admiral had call'd a Council, we weigh'd and &s;et Sail about ten a Clock at night. Three days after our departure from St. <HI>Helens,</HI> the Seamen were call'd very dully to prayers morning and evening; though all the time we &s;taid in the rode, they never minded any &s;uch matter; which made me wonder, to find they &s;hould be more devout when they were out of danger, than when they were in jeopardy.</P>
<P>After &s;everal other days &s;ailing, we di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;t of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and then the I&s;land of <HI>Ferella,</HI> where we join'd with the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet that &s;tay'd for us. Here it is that the Commander in chief calls to account all the Mariners for their mi&s;de|meanours during the whole Voyage.</P>
<P>Our Ship was bound for <HI>Zealand;</HI> but we were forc'd to Iye out at Sea &s;even days before we could get into <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> becau&s;e the Sand had chang'd its place. Coming to an Anchor before <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> two of the Company came aboard to wel|come us home, and to advi&s;e us to lock our Che&s;ts, and put our marks upon them; for all Che&s;ts are carry'd into the Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Hou&s;e, where when the owners come for them, they are order'd to op'n them, le&s;t they &s;hould have any counterband goods therein. Thereupon I &s;et a mark upon my Che&s;ts, and went a&s;hore, after I had giv'n a good character of the Captain, and his civility to me all the Voyage, and thence proceed by Land to <HI>Middleburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Four days after I came to <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> I went to fetch my Che&s;ts; and find|ing the two Directors there, one a <HI>Zealander,</HI> the other of <HI>Horn,</HI> who came fir&s;t aboard us; I produc'd my Keys, and offer'd my Che&s;ts to be open'd. But the <HI>Zea|lander</HI> more civil than the <HI>Horner,</HI> deliver'd me my Keys again, and taking my word, told me I was free to take away my goods. And indeed I have always ob|&s;erv'd, that the Northern people are always more rude and ungentile than the Southern.</P>
<P>As for the 17500 Florins which the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> promis'd &s;hould be paid me upon my arrival in <HI>Holland,</HI> I receiv'd &s;o many delays and put off's, that I was length forc'd to commenced a Suit that la&s;ted above two years; nor could I get a publick Notary either at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> or the <HI>Hague,</HI> that would make me out a prote&s;t, every one fearing the Directors, who were both Judges and Par|ties. At length after five years wrangling and jangling, the Director wrote to my Brother at <HI>Batavia:</HI> (for I was then return'd again to the <HI>Indies)</HI> that if I would accept of 10000 Livres, he might receive it for me; which he did, and was forc'd to give them an acquittance form the whole.</P>
<P>This is the return which I made from the <HI>Indies</HI> in the year 1649, and the only time that ever I return'd by Sea; having perform'd all the re&s;t of my Travels by Land, not counting my &s;hort Voyages through the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> for any thing. And as for my fir&s;t Travels, perform'd them all by Land, from <HI>Paris</HI> through <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> whither I return'd again in the year 1669. From <HI>Constantinople</HI> I went to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> thence I &s;ail'd for <HI>Ligorn;</HI> from <HI>Ligorn</HI> I travel'd by Land to <HI>Genoa,</HI> thence to <HI>Turin,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Author's De&s;ign.</HEAD>
<P>I Que&s;tion not but that &s;everal Relations of the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI>'s <HI>Seraglio</HI> have been publi&s;h'd; but I am to acknowledge withal that I have not had the lei&s;ure to read any one of them. I have travell'd &s;ix &s;everal times, by Land, into the Ea&s;t, and by different Roads, during the &s;pace of Forty Years; and mo&s;t per&s;ons know, that my Employ|ments were &s;uch, as would not allow me much time for the reading of Books. But when my Affairs afforded me any re|mi&s;&s;ion, I wholly employ'd tho&s;e &s;pare hours, in the collection of things the mo&s;t worthy to be remark'd, whether the Scene lay in <HI>Turkey,</HI> or in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or in the <HI>Indies,</HI> on this, or the other &s;ide of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> or in the <HI>Diamond-Mines,</HI> which are in the Territories of divers Princes. While I am bu|&s;ied in putting into order tho&s;e Memories, which I conceive my &s;elf oblig'd to gratify the Publick withal, I make it a Pre&s;ent of this <HI>Relation</HI> of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> attended with &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations &s;ufficiently remarkable, which, haply, will not be un|plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, which makes &s;o much noi&s;e in the World, has not, to my thinking, been yet &s;ufficiently well known, if I may judge of it, by what I have &s;eene thereof my &s;elf, and have heard from &s;everal Per&s;ons. I do here com|municate a faithful and ample de&s;cription thereof: which I have extracted, as well out of what I had ob&s;erv'd my &s;elf, in the &s;everal Voyages I made to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as out of the infor|mations I receiv'd from two intelligent Per&s;ons, who had &s;pent many years in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> in very con&s;iderable Employments. One of whom was a <HI>Sicilian,</HI> advanc'd to the Charge of <HI>Cha&s;|nadar-bachi,</HI> or chief Officer belonging to the Trea&s;ury; and after Five and Fifty years Service in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> was, for &s;ome &s;light mi&s;carriage committed by him, bani&s;h'd to a place near <HI>Bur&s;a,</HI> in <HI>Natolia,</HI> from whence he made his e&s;cape into the <HI>Indies.</HI> The other, a <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI>-born, named <HI>De Vienne;</HI> had been one of the Pages of the Trea&s;ury. In his Return from the Jubilee at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Year M. DC. L. being aboard a Brigantine bound from <HI>Civita Vecchia</HI> to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> he was
<PB REF="273">
taken by the Pyrates of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and the Ba&s;&s;a finding that young Lad well &s;hap'd, and looking like one that promis'd much, &s;ent him, as a Pre&s;ent, to the Grand Seignor. He was al&s;o pack'd away out of the Seraglio, after Fifteen Years Service, only upon this &s;core, that there was &s;ome di&s;covery made, of his holding a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the di&s;grac'd <HI>Sicilian,</HI> who had heretofore &s;hewn him much kindne&s;s, and indeed it was by his credit that the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> was fir&s;t advanc'd to the Chamber of the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e two men, who were in a fair capacity to make exact Ob&s;ervations of things, have I extracted the better part of this <HI>Relation.</HI> Though they had been forc'd to embrace the erroneous per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> yet were there &s;ome Relicks of the good &s;entiments of Chri&s;tianity: And whereas there was not the lea&s;t hope of recovering the honours, where|in they pride them&s;elves who are exalted to Charges in the Seraglio, it is not to be imagin'd, that they could have any de&s;ign to di&s;gui&s;e things to me. They them&s;elves thought it a certain plea&s;ure to de&s;cend to a greater familiarity of Di&s;|cour&s;e, and to &s;pecifie even the lea&s;t circum&s;tances: but I am to di&s;cover withal, that having had their education among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> and learnt of them, to love Money, it mu&s;t have been &s;o much the greater charge to me, to give them content. I have kept them for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time, at my own charge, and that in &s;everal places, one at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they had made their re&s;idences, and the Memoires which they &s;upply'd me withal were perfect|ly concordant.</P>
<P>To the In&s;tructions, which I made a &s;hift to get from tho&s;e two men, and to what di&s;coveries I may have made my &s;elf, of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Grand Seignor's Palace, I &s;hall add &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Ob&s;ervations of the Manners and Cu&s;tomes of &s;everal Provinces of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ing over tho&s;e things, which, in all probability, are generally known. But that the Reader may with greater ea&s;e comprehend the matters I treat of, and that the di&s;cour&s;e may not be inter|rupted, by the nece&s;&s;ary explication of the &s;everal names of Charges and Dignities, I have thought it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it, in the fir&s;t place, to give a &s;hort Li&s;t of them, after which &s;hall follow another, of the different Species of Money, which are current all over the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origine of the Grandees of the Port.</NOTE> THey who are advanc'd to Charges, whether it be in the Seraglio, or in the Empire (excepting only the Eunuchs, of whom I &s;hall give an account anon) are generally rais'd out of the Children taken in War, or &s;ent by way of Pre&s;ents, by the Ba&s;&s;a's, or out of the Tributary Children, who, about nine or ten years of Age, are taken out of their Mothers arms, through all the Provinces' &s;ubdu'd by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes. They are all to be of Chri&s;tian Parents; and count|ing only the Slaves taken from the Enemy, we find the Regi&s;ters of the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> alone, that, of both Sexes, there are brought thither every year near twenty thou&s;and. The Inhabitants of the le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary,</HI> who make conti|nual Incur&s;ions into all the Countries, that are in ho&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, &s;end up va&s;t numbers of them, and the Grand Seignor having the choice of all tho&s;e young Children, the be&s;t &s;hap'd, and &s;uch as have the mo&s;t promi&s;ing looks, are di&s;tributed into &s;everal Seraglio's, to be there in&s;tructed in the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and all &s;orts of Exerci&s;es. And afterwards, out of the choice or cullings of the&s;e la&s;t is the Seraglio of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> repleni&s;h'd; and they are to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into two Orders. The fir&s;t and the mo&s;t eminent is that of the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> de&s;ign'd for the great Charges and Dignities of the Empire: The &s;econd, that of the <HI>Azamoglans,</HI> employ'd in &s;uch Offices as require only &s;trength of body. The <HI>Ichoglans</HI> are tho&s;e, in whom, be&s;ides the accompli&s;hments of the Body, they di&s;cover al&s;o a noble Ge|nius, fit for a high Education, and &s;uch as may render them capable of &s;erving their Prince, &s;ome time or other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;evere Di|&s;cipline of the Seraglio.</NOTE> The&s;e are accordingly in&s;tructed with great care, and educared with the ob&s;ervance of a mo&s;t &s;evere Di&s;cipli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. They pa&s;s through four &s;everal Chambers, called <HI>Oda's,</HI> which are as it were four Forms, where they learn, in order, whatever is convenient for young per&s;ons, who are to be continually about a great Prince, and are as it were his Pages or Gentlemen. If they commit the lea&s;t fault, they are &s;everely cha&s;tis'd, and there is a great &s;tock of patience requi&s;ire, for any one to be advanc'd to the fourth <HI>Oda,</HI> which when they have attain'd, they begin to rake a little breath. But the hopes of being exalted to the greate&s;t Honours, and the mo&s;t eminent Dignities, makes them endure the barbarous treatments of the Eunuchs; who are appointed to be their Ma&s;ters, and are very liberal of the Ba&s;tinado to them: I &s;hall give an account el&s;e where of the manner of their Education, and of tho&s;e four <HI>Oda'</HI>s, or Chambers, where they learn tho&s;e things, whereby they are qualifi'd for the Charges, for which the Grand Seignor de&s;igns them. Though it be appointed by the received Cu&s;tom of the Em|pire, that tho&s;e Children &s;hould be all de&s;cended from <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Parents&punc; of the be&s;t extraction, and the be&s;t &s;hap'd that can be found; yet the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> or Grand Ma|&s;ter of the Seraglio, the Principal of the white Eunuchs, who hath the chief Com|mand over the <HI>I hoglans,</HI> &s;ticks not to admit into their number &s;ome natural <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;uch as may be r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">commendable, upon the &s;core of their good qualities and endow|ments: But that happens very &s;eldom, and that not without the particular permi&s;&s;ion of the Prince, who would rather have all tho&s;e Children to be Renegado-Chri&s;tians.
<PB N="3" REF="275">
And this is the Origine of the Great Per&s;ons belonging to the Grand Seignor, and the Port. They are all Slaves, and not having any knowledge of their Pa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ents, or Relations, they wholly apply their Affections to the Service of their Prince, who has been pleas'd to advance them to &s;uch high Fortunes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authority of the four Principal Ba&s;|&s;a's, of dange|rous con&s;equence to the Grand Seignor, and how he can take it off.</NOTE> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> therefore are taken out of the Order of the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> and the name of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> is only a Title of Honour and Dignity, common to all the Grandees of the Port, who are di&s;tingui&s;hable, according to the difference of their Charges. The four Principal are the&s;e. The <HI>Vizir-Azem,</HI> or <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a of the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Aga of the Janizaries.</HI> The Authority of the&s;e four Ba&s;&s;a's is &s;o great, that &s;ometimes they deprive their Sovereign of the Crown, and be&s;tow it on whom they plea&s;e; as it has happen'd, in our Age, to two Emperours imme|diately &s;ucceeding one the other, <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> and <HI>O&s;man,</HI> of whom the later dy'd in Pri|&s;on, by the infamous hand of a common Executioner. But on the other &s;ide; if the&s;e <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> know not how to take their mea&s;ures rightly, they lo&s;e their heads upon the lea&s;t mi&s;carriage, the Grand Seignor &s;eizing to him&s;elf all their E&s;tates at their death, and taking their Children into the Seraglio. Nay, the&s;e la&s;t are &s;o far from &s;uc|ceeding their Fathers, either as to wealth or imployments, even though it were the Son of a <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> or of a Si&s;ter of the Emperour him&s;elf, that the highe&s;t ad|vancement they are admitted to, is to be made Captains of Gallies; the policy of the <HI>Turks</HI> not permitting, that in any one Hou&s;e there &s;hould be a transference of power from Father to Son, that &s;o they may be prevented from taking any occa&s;ions to di&s;turb the State. It may be &s;een by this account of them, that the fortune of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> which for a time &s;eems &s;o &s;plendid, is but a tottering fortune, upon which neither the Son, nor the Father him&s;elf, what repute &s;oever he may be in, can make any &s;ure reliance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations upon the Stan|dards.</NOTE> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> who have the denomination of <HI>Vizirs,</HI> carry three Banners or Stan|dards, at the top of which there is a Hor&s;e-tayl fa&s;ten'd, put into what colour they plea&s;e them&s;elves, green only excepted, thought they are permitted to paint the Staff, to which the Standard is fa&s;ten'd, with that colour. The Origine of this Cu&s;tom was thus, according to the Story which the <HI>Turks</HI> relate of it. Having one day given Battel to the Chri&s;tians, their Standard was taken in the heat of the Engagement, and the General of the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving that the lo&s;s of the Standard was a di&s;cou|ragement to the Souldiers, who were beginning to take their flight, he with a Cy|mitar cut off a Hor&s;e's rayl, and fa&s;ten'd it to the top of a Half Pike, and advanc'd it on high, crying out, <HI>Here is the Grand Standard, let him who loves me follow me.</HI> Im|mediately the <HI>Turks</HI> re-a&s;&s;um'd Courage, and having rally'd, renew'd the Charge, and gain'd the Victory. The Officers who are about the Per&s;ons of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s, have al&s;o their Standards, but they are not allow'd to add thereto one of tho&s;e tayls; and it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s, who are not <HI>Vizirs,</HI> can carry but two of them; as the <HI>Beys,</HI> who are inferiour to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s, and Governours of le&s;&s;er Provinces, carry but one of them. When the Grand Seignor goes into the Country, there are &s;even Standards carry'd, in regard that according to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the world is divided into &s;even parts, or &s;even Climats whereof the Grand Seignor is Ma&s;ter, if taken according to its breadth, and 'tis for that rea&s;on that in their Language, they give him the Title of <HI>Ma&s;ter of all Kings.</HI> This is grounded upon what <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;aid, That he, who after his death, &s;hould be Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Territories, where his Sepulchre were found, &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the Title of Ma&s;ter of Chief of all the Kings upon Earth. They add, that there are but three Empires, which are, tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Babylon</HI> and <HI>Trebizond:</HI> And 'tis for that rea&s;on, that the Grand Seignor wears three plumes of black Heron-tops in his Turbant. Take Notice by the way, that they are only the Herons of <HI>Candia</HI> which have their tops perfectly black, the Herons of all other Countries having them, either white, or of a mixt Colour. And becau&s;e there mu&s;t be a con&s;iderable quantity of them to make up a plume, it mu&s;t accordingly be of a very great value, which po&s;&s;ibly has occa&s;ion'd its being cut of u&s;e in <HI>Europe:</HI> For as to all the Princes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> they have &s;till a great e&s;teem for the Heron-tops; but they mu&s;t not have the lea&s;t defect, and if the points of them be ever &s;o little broken, there is no account made of them, as being things of very little value. By tho&s;e three Heron-tops upon the Grand Seignor's Turbant, it is known that the Grand Vizier is in the Army; ina&s;much as at that time, he wears
<PB N="4" REF="276">
but two of them, and the thing is worthy our Ob&s;ervation. When the Army is to march, the Grand Seignor gives Order for the drawing up tho&s;e Troops which are at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the parts adjacent, and having the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> near him, he pre&s;ents him to them for their General. The Souldiers, at that time, &s;ay not a Word, nor do they make the ordinary &s;alute, till after the Grand Seignor has caus'd one plume of the Heron-tops to be taken out of his Turbant, and to be put upon that of the <HI>Grand Vizir;</HI> and upon that Ceremony, the whole Army &s;alutes him, and acknowledge him for their General, and from that very time are to receive their Pay from him.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> in general, it is requi&s;ite I &s;hould give &s;ome Idea of tho&s;e who are advanc'd to the principal Charges of the Empire, and I &s;hall bring into that Li&s;t, the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> accompany'd by &s;ix others, who have the quality of <HI>Vizirs,</HI> the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a of the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Aga of the Janizaries;</HI> after whom I &s;hall come down to the <HI>Beglierbeys,</HI> and to the <HI>Sangiacbeys,</HI> and to the <HI>Bo&s;&s;angi-bacbi,</HI> who has one of the mo&s;t erninent Charges of the Port.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Honours and Di&s;advan|tages attending the Charge of <HI>Grand Vizir.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Vizir-Azem,</HI> or <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> is the Licutenant-General of the Empire, and of the Armies, the principal Per&s;on of the Council, and he who, under the Grand Seignor's Orders, has the ab&s;olute di&s;p&s;oal of all Affaris, relating to the State, or to the War, having in his cu&s;tody the Imperial Seal. He is attended by, and has a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him, in the Divan, &s;ix other <HI>Vizirs,</HI> whom they call <HI>Vizirs of the bench,</HI> and who are properly Coun&s;ellors of State, but yet &s;uch as have not any deliberative voice, and come not into the Divan, but only to be con&s;ulted upon &s;ome point of Law, wherein they are well skill'd, without intermedling with the government of the State; or concerning them&s;elves in any Affair, unle&s;s their advice be requir'd. There are al&s;o five <HI>Beglerbeys,</HI> on whom the Grand Seignor be&s;tows the qualifi|cation of <HI>Vizirs,</HI> and are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the greate&s;t anh wealthie&s;t Governments of the, Empire, to wit, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> of <HI>Babylon, Cairo, Buda, Natolia</HI> and <HI>Romania.</HI> The three former, who are the three principal, had heretofore the priviledge (exclu&s;ively to all the other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's)</HI> of having caried before them (in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Grand Vizir</HI> had) the three Hor&s;e-tayls, of which I have related the Story. But at the pre|&s;ent, that priviledge extends to the two other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> of <HI>Natolia</HI> and <HI>Romania,</HI> and they are all five equal, as to that point.</P>
<P>I am now to return to the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> who has a magnificent Court, an&s;werable to the greatne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter, whom he &s;erves, and there are in his hou&s;e above two thou&s;and Dome&s;ticks. Though he lyes expos'd, as well as the other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> to the indignation of the Prince, and forc'd to &s;end him his Head, when he requires it; yet does the Grand Seignor, in the Affairs of greate&s;t importance, and &s;uch as con|cern the State, comply much with the Sentiments of his <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> and his Propo&s;iti|ons in Council are as &s;o many definitive Sentences. 'Tis that which renders his Power &s;o ab&s;olute, that in all the Empires and Kingdoms of the World, there is not any chief Mini&s;ter of State who&s;e Authority can be parallel'd to that of the <HI>Grand Vizir.</HI> Whoever comes to make him a Vi&s;it, he ri&s;es not out of his Chair, either to give him a reception, or to conduct him out again, unle&s;s it be the <HI>Mufti,</HI> who is the principal Per&s;on relating to the Law (of <HI>Mahomet)</HI> upon who&s;e acce&s;s, the Grand Seig|nor him&s;elf ri&s;es from his Throne. But this particularly worth our ob&s;ervation, That as it belongs only to the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> to propo&s;e all Affairs of importance, &s;o does it concern him to be very careful, not to advance any thing that may be di&s;|plea&s;ing to the Grand Seignor; for if it &s;hould &s;o happen, he gives immediate Order for the &s;trangling of him, without making him any an&s;wer at all, upon this Maxime of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, that there mu&s;t not be any thing propos'd to the Prince, which may give him any cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Priviledge particular to the <HI>Caimacan.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Caimacan</HI> is the Captain, and Governour of the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> Lieute|nant to the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> yet &s;o as not to have any Authority, but only in his ab&s;ence; And then he performs all the functions of that important Charge; he has the ab&s;olute Command and gives Audience to Amba&s;&s;adors. He is not &s;ubject, as the other <HI>Baf|&s;a's</HI> are, to that rigorous nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;igning his Head; upon this account, that if he does any thing, which may be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Grand Seignor, he lays the blame thereof upon the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> from whom he receives his Orders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a of the Sea</HI> is the Admiral, and Captain-General of the Naval Forces. The <HI>Beys,</HI> Governours of the Maritime Provinces, and &s;uch as are oblig'd to maintain the Grand Seignor's Galleys in good order, are to obey the Commands they receive from him, and to go to Sea upon the fir&s;t adverti&s;ement they receive to that purpo&s;e.</P>

They have excellent Regulations among&s;t them&s;elves, and are di&s;tributed into &s;everal Chambers, in the &s;pacious Lodgings, whereof they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, whether it be at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or in other places. The order ob&s;erv'd there is &s;o excellent in all things, and &s;o exactly maintain'd, that they live more like Religi|ous Per&s;ons, than Souldiers; and though they are not forbidden to marry, yet it is very &s;eldom that they do it. The great Priviledges which they enjoy all over the Empire, wherein they are &s;o highly re&s;pected, induce abundance of Per&s;ons, meerly in order to their exemption from the paying of Taxes, and their being di&s;charg'd from publick Duties, to prevail with the Officers, by Money, to protect them, and make them pa&s;s for <HI>Janizaries.</HI> But they receive no Pay from the Prince, and all their ad|vantage is re&s;train'd to the enjoyment of tho&s;e Priviledges, which indeed are great enough. It is by this intermixture of the real <HI>Janizaries,</HI> with tho&s;e who are admit|ted by corruption, that the number of them amounts at this day to above a hundred thou&s;and; and yet not accounting any but &s;uch as are effectively <HI>Janizaries,</HI> their Body has &s;ometimes been &s;o dreadful, as that they have unthron'd the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchs, and chang'd the whole face of the Empire of a &s;udden.</P>

<P>The <HI>Beglerbeys</HI> are, in dignity, next the four fir&s;t <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and are as't were &s;o many Soveraigns, in the general Government of the Empire, whereof the Grand Seignor be&s;tows the Command on them.

<P>And whereas there will al&s;o be frequently mention'd &s;ome others, under the De|nominations of <HI>Spahis, Zaims</HI> and <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> we mu&s;t give a &s;hort account of tho&s;e three &s;orts of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spahis,</HI> who make up a Body of about fifteen thou&s;and Men, are a kind of Knights, who would pa&s;s for the Gentry or Nobility of the Country, and &s;tand very much upon their Gallantry. They are maintain'd out of the Revenue of the <HI>Timars,</HI> that is to &s;ay, out of the Mannors, or Commanderies, which the Grand Seignor be|&s;tows on them, according to the recompence he would make them for their &s;ervices. Tho&s;e <HI>Timars</HI> cannot be taken away from them, unle&s;s they be negligent in their du|ty, which is, that they &s;hould be in the Army, when the <HI>Grand Vizir</HI> is there in per&s;on. The&s;e are the happie&s;t per&s;ons in all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and as it were pet|ty Soveraigns, in he places where they command.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zaims</HI> differ not much from the <HI>Spahis,</HI> and, as the other, have the Command and Revenues of certain Lands, or Fiefs, which the Grand Seignor be&s;tows on them. There is a very great number of them over all the Empire, and they look on them|&s;elves, as the Lords and Barons of the Country. The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>Zaims</HI> and the <HI>Spahis,</HI> and they know what number of Hor&s;e they are to bring into Field, according to the Revenue of their <HI>Timars.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cbaoux,</HI> or <HI>Chiaoux-Bachi,</HI> is the Chief of all the <HI>Chaoux</HI> of the Empire, who&s;e imployment it is to carry the Prince's Commands, to any part either within his Ter|ritories, or without, and to be &s;ent upon Emba&s;&s;ies, though indded they are but as &s;o many Me&s;&s;engers, or Expre&s;&s;es.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prodigious number of <HI>Eu|nuchs</HI> all over the Ea&s;t.</NOTE> Of the <HI>Eunuchs</HI> there are al&s;o two ranks. There are &s;ome white, who have en|dur'd only a &s;imple ca&s;tration; and there are black ones, who have all cut off, even with the belly. Both &s;orts of them are &s;evere, humorous and moro&s;e, and their Treatments are almo&s;t in&s;upportable to all tho&s;e who are under their Charge. There is a prodigious number of them, as well in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as all over the Empire, and generally all over the Ea&s;tern parts of the World, where there is hardly a private Per&s;on, having any thing of abilities, but keeps an Eunuch or two, as Sentinels over his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations upon this Sub|ject.</NOTE>Women. And 'tis this that cau&s;es &s;o great a commerce of Eunuchs in &s;everal parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> and in the &s;ingle Kingdom of <HI>Colconda,</HI> where I chanc'd to be in the year 1659. there were put off of them in that very year about two and twenty thou|&s;and. It comes into my mind, that the Grand <HI>Mogor</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador, in who&s;e Coun|try that Barbari&s;m is not &s;uffer'd, but the Eunuchs he makes u&s;e of are brought out of other places, took me one day a&s;ide, to tell me that he car'd not how &s;oon he re|turn'd into his own Country, out of the fear he was in, le&s;t that Kingdom of <HI>Colconda</HI> might &s;ink into the ground, after &s;uch cruelties. Mo&s;t of the Fathers and Mothers, who are extreamly poor, and have no love for their Children, and whom they are al&s;o afraid that they cannot maintain, have no other &s;hift, upon the fir&s;t dearth of Provi&s;ions, than to &s;ell them to certain Merchants, who afterwards have them gelt, and &s;ometimes make clear work, and cut of all. Some of tho&s;e who have not any thing le&s;t, when they would urine, are forc'd to make u&s;e of a little Cane or Pipe, and to put it to the bottom of the belly. And whereas few e&s;cape after &s;o dangerous an operation, &s;uch are accordingly much dearer than the others, and they are &s;old in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI> at the rase of &s;ix hundred Crowns; when a hundred, or a hun|dred and fifty, is the price of the ordinary Eunuchs. For the &s;upply therefore of all <HI>Turkey,</HI> all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and all the Provinces of <HI>Africa,</HI> it may be ea&s;ily judg'd that there mu&s;t come millions of them from &s;everal places. The Kingdom of <HI>Colcunda,</HI> in the Penin&s;ula on this &s;ide <HI>Ganges,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;&s;an, Boutan, Arachan,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> on the other &s;ide of it, afford a prodigious number of them. All the&s;e Eunuchs are either white, or of duski&s;h colour. The black Eunuchs, who are brought out of <HI>Africa,</HI> much inferiour in point of number, are, as I &s;aid, much the dearer. The mo&s;t deformed yield the greate&s;t price, their extream ugline&s;s being look'd on as beauty in their kind. A flat No&s;e, a frightful A&s;pect, a large Mouth, thick Lips, the Teeth black, and &s;tanding at a di&s;tance one from another (for ordi|narily the Moots have fair Teeth) are &s;o many advantages to the Merchants who &s;ell them. The Seraglio at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is full of the&s;e two &s;orts of Eunuchs: The black are de&s;ign'd for the cu&s;tody of the Apartment where the Women are, and &s;ent to Court by the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> of <HI>Grand-Cairo.</HI> The white, who are &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;avage, and have been educated with &s;ome care, are for the Grand Seignor's own Apart|ment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The principal Charges of the Seraglio.</NOTE> The four principal Eunuchs, who approach the Prince's Per&s;on, are the <HI>Hazodaba|chi,</HI> the <HI>Cha&s;nadarbachi,</HI> the <HI>Kilargibachi,</HI> and the <HI>Sarai-Aga&s;i,</HI> who have for their Su|periour the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who has the &s;uperintendency of all the Chambers of the <HI>Ichog|lans.</HI> They ordinarily &s;ucceed one the other, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Sarai-Aga&s;i</HI> &s;ucceeds the <HI>Kilargibachi;</HI> the <HI>Kilargibachi</HI> &s;ucceeds the <HI>Cha&s;nadarbachi;</HI> and the la&s;t named &s;uc|ceeds the <HI>Hazodabachi;</HI> and in fine, the <HI>Hazodabachi</HI> &s;ucceeds the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who is always of the longe&s;t &s;tanding in &s;ervice of the white Eunuchs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The noble Ad|vantages of the <HI>Aga.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> or <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i,</HI> is as it were the Grand Ma&s;ter of the Seraglio, he is the principal in dignity and repute of all the white Eunuchs, and he is always near the Grand Seignor's Per&s;on, where-ever he is. He is the Per&s;on who introduces Amba&s;|&s;adors to Audience, and all great Affairs pa&s;&s;ing through his hands, e're they come into tho&s;e of the Prince, his Charge renders him nece&s;&s;ary to all others, and procures him many rich Pre&s;ents. All tho&s;e per&s;ons al&s;o who are to make any Pre&s;ent to the Grand Seignor, mu&s;t addre&s;s them&s;elves to the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> in order to their being pre|&s;ented
<PB N="7" REF="277">
to his Highne&s;s, of which he makes great Advantages. No Man can enter into the Emperour's Apartment, nor get out of it, without his Order; and when the <HI>Grand Vizir</HI> would &s;peak to him, 'tis the <HI>Capi-Aga</HI>'s place, to take and pre&s;ent him to his Highne&s;s. Whether it be by night or by day, if there happen &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing Affair, whereof the <HI>Vizir</HI> would give the Grand Seignor immediate notice in wri|ting, the <HI>Capi-Aga</HI> receives it from him and brings him the an&s;wer thereto. He wears his Turbant in the Seraglio, and rides up and down on Hor&s;e-back, by a Priviledge particularly annex'd to his Charge. He accompanies the Grand Seignor even into the Apartment of the Sultane&s;&s;es, but he &s;tays at the door, as having no Command in that place. When he leaves the Seraglio, upon his being di&s;mi&s;s'd from his Charge, which very &s;eldom happens, he cannot be a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> As to his Table, all is at the Prince's Charge, and he has over and above ten <HI>Sultanines</HI> a day, which amount to &s;ixty Livers, <HI>French</HI> Money. There have been &s;ome <HI>Capi-Aga</HI>'s who have dy'd worth two millions, all which return'd into the Grand Seignor's Coffers. The chief of the white Eunuchs is attended by four others, who next to him have the principal Charges of the Grand Seignor's Quarter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hazodabachi,</HI> is, as it were, the Lord High-Chamberlain, having under his Charge the forty Pages of the Chamber, who ordinarily approach the Grand Seig|nor's Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serai-Aga&s;i</HI> has the general Superintendency of all the Chambers of the Grand Seignor's Quarter, as to what relates to Embelli&s;hment, and the nece&s;&s;ary Repara|tions. He has a particular in&s;pection over the <HI>Seferli Oda&s;i,</HI> which is the Chamber of the Pages, who are to look after the Grand Seignor's Linnen, and attend him in his Progre&s;&s;es. 'Tis incumbent al&s;o upon him to give Order for their Cloaths, and whatever el&s;e they &s;tand in need of: And his Charge does &s;omewhat re&s;emble that of Captain of the <HI>Louver-Ca&s;tle,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince it is his work generally to make pro|vi&s;ion for whatever may contribute to the decency and well-ordering of that great Palace. He has for his A&s;&s;i&s;tant, or Lieutenant, the <HI>Seraiket-Oda&s;i,</HI> who is al&s;o an Eunuch, who&s;e imployment it is to have the Tapi&s;try and Carpets which are &s;pread upon the Floors, in the Halls and Lodgings of the Seraglio, chang'd every &s;ix months.</P>
<P>The <HI>Haznadar,</HI> or <HI>Chaznadar-Bachi,</HI> is the chief Intendant of the Trea&s;ury, and has the in&s;pection of the conduct and deportment of the Pages of that Camber. Which is not to be under&s;tood of the Trea&s;ury, de&s;ign'd for the exigencies of the State, and the ordinary Pay of the Souldiery, and whereof the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> and the three <HI>Tefterdars,</HI> or Trea&s;urers-General have the Keys, and Intendency. But I here &s;peak of, is the place where they keep the Jewels of the Crown, and all the other Rari|ties, and the wealth gather'd together, from Father to Son, by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes; which I &s;hall endeavour to lay down di&s;tinctly, before the Reader's pro&s;pect, in my Relation, when I come to open to him both the Trea&s;uries. However it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Chaznadar-bachi</HI> has only the honorary title of chief of the Trea|&s;ury, nay, that he cannot &s;o much as enter into it, &s;ince that in the Reign of Sultan <HI>Amurat,</HI> the Pages of the Trea&s;ury having complain'd to the Grand Seignor of the ill conduct of that Eunuch, he, upon their Petition, order'd that the <HI>Chaznadar-bachi</HI> &s;hould no longer have any Command there, and that the <HI>Chaznaket-oda&s;i</HI> &s;hould for the future exerci&s;e his Charge, without depriving him of the title thereof. But in regard the <HI>Chaznadar-bachi</HI> is the better known, and the more pronounceable Name, I &s;hall always make u&s;e of it, in&s;tead of the other; and we mu&s;t not omit giving you this remark, That when the Chief, or Over&s;eer of the Trea&s;ury, is remov'd from his Charge, he is made a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> Upon this counterchanging of the&s;e two Officers of the Seraglio, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That, among&s;t all the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes, <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians, Indians,</HI> and of what Sect &s;oever they may be of, what has been order'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Reign of one Prince, is never revok'd by his Suc|ce&s;&s;or: And under the &s;ame <HI>Sultan Amurat,</HI> the <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i</HI> having committed &s;ome little impertinence, whereat the Grand Seignor took offence, he excluded thence|forwards all the <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i's,</HI> who &s;hould be remov'd out of the Seraglio, from the priviledge of coming into a capacity to be made <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's.</HI> I &s;hall not think it much to alledge upon this particular, another example of that Maxime, of which I was an eye-witne&s;s my &s;elf, in the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Court. 'Twas in the Reign of <HI>Scach Abas,</HI> again&s;t whom &s;ome Grandees of the Court had enter'd into a Con&s;piracy, and
<PB N="8" REF="278">
attempted to take away the King's Life, yet with a de&s;ign to have put his Son into the Throne. About Two or Three in the afternoon, when every one in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is retir'd to the <HI>Haram,</HI> which is the Appartment of the Women, the Con&s;pirators &s;ent to the Palaces twenty Men well arm'd, with Order, fir&s;t, to put to the Sword all they &s;hould find at the Gates, which ordinarily are guarded only by two ot three Men, armed with a ma&s;&s;y Club, and afterwards to go and murther the King him&s;elf in the <HI>Haram,</HI> which would be but poorly defended by black and white Eunuchs, who are poor Souldiers. But the intended blow of the Con&s;pirators was prevented, and the chief Porter, a Per&s;on accounted one of the mo&s;t valiant of his time, being in his Station, with two of his Servants, <HI>Georgians</HI> by Country, that is to &s;ay, valiant, as all tho&s;e People are, fell upon the Traitors with his Cuttelas, and beat them back &s;o &s;martly, that they thought it the be&s;t way to run for't. The King having been inform'd of that action, order'd him to be brought into his Pre&s;ence, and after he had commended him, made this e&s;tabli&s;hment, That the Charge of chief Porter, &s;hould ever continue in his Family, from Father to Son. He al&s;o commanded the Keeper of the Archives, or Records, to in&s;ert that action into the Hi&s;tory, and wi&s;h'd that his own Name might be da&s;h'd out of it, and all that had been done during his Reign, if any of his Succe&s;&s;ors attempted to change any thing of his Will, and deprive the Hou&s;e of that Faithful <HI>Georgian</HI> of that Charge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kilargi-bachi</HI> is the chief Governour of the Pages of the <HI>Kilar,</HI> which is the place where they keep all the exqui&s;ite Drinks for the Grand Seignor's own drinking. It is a kind of Cup-bearers Office, and the <HI>Kilargi-bachi,</HI> a kind of Cup-bearer; and he is al&s;o made a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> upon his removal from the Charge of <HI>Kilargi-bachi.</HI> He is more|over the Chief or all the <HI>Akegis,</HI> who are the Cooks and Confectioners, &s;ince no Body can have any entrance into tho&s;e Offices, but by his Order; and he has un|der his cu&s;tody all the Plate, which is for the peculiar &s;ervice of the Grand Seignor. This Officer has for his Sub&s;titute the <HI>Kilarketoda&s;i.</HI> Now having told you, that, upon the re&s;ignation of his Charge, he is made a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> it were not ami&s;s to adverti&s;e you further, That they who are remov'd out of the Seraglio, in order to their being <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> ought to have been of the number of the forty Pages of the Chamber, and to have pa&s;s'd through one of the&s;e &s;ix Charges, of <HI>Cha&s;naketoda&s;i,</HI> and of <HI>Kilarketoda&s;i,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken already, of <HI>Dogangibachi,</HI> of the <HI>Chokadar,</HI> of the <HI>Seligdar,</HI> and of the <HI>Rikabdar,</HI> of whom I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e anon. Otherwi&s;e, they can only be <HI>Beys,</HI> or <HI>Zaims,</HI> or <HI>Spahis,</HI> or at mo&s;t, but <HI>Capigibachis,</HI> by the Grand Seignor's &s;ingular favour. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the <HI>Cugombachi,</HI> who is the &s;econd Per|&s;on of the Office of the Trea&s;ury, as al&s;o with the <HI>Anakdar-Aga&s;i,</HI> who is the third. If the&s;e People remove out of the Seraglio, be fore they are admitted into the num|ber of the Forty Pages of the Chamber, they have only a certain Pay, more or le&s;s, the highe&s;t whereof amounts not to above two hundred A&s;pers. I proceed to the other Officers of the Seraglio, of whom there will be &s;ome mention made in my Relation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dogangi-bachi</HI> is the Grand Falconer, and his Charge makes him a con&s;idera|ble Per&s;on about the Prince.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chokador</HI> is he who carries the Royal Robe,, called the <HI>Ciamberluc,</HI> the &s;ame Officer which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Portemanteau.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rikabdar</HI> is he who holds the Stirrup, when the Grand Seignor gets on Hor&s;e|back.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seligdar</HI> is the fir&s;t of the Pages of the Chamber; he carries the Grand Seig|nor's Sword upon days of Ceremony, and they ordinarily advance to that Charge one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Pages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hammangibachi</HI> is the chief Over&s;eer of the Bath. When he leaves the Sera|glio, as al&s;o when the <HI>Kamachirbachi,</HI> who is the chiefe&s;t of the Pages of <HI>Seferli,</HI> does &s;o; their Pay is an hundered A&s;pers a day; and if they are in favour, it may amount to an hundered an fifty. It is to be ob&s;erv'd in the general, that when any one of the Forty Pages of the Chamber is remov'd, the vacancy is &s;upply'd &s;ometimes out of the Trea&s;ury, &s;ometimes out of the <HI>Kilar,</HI> and &s;ometimes out of the <HI>Seferti,</HI> and in that they take their turns. They always take out the mo&s;t ancient; and they who were next to them come into their places. How that is done, we &s;hall take oc|ca&s;ion to explicate more plainly in the Chapter of the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="278">
The <HI>Chiamc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bachi</HI> is the grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aundry-man, or the Principal of tho&s;e, who wa&s;h and order the Grand Seignor's Linnen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Giritbey</HI> is the chief Director of tho&s;e who are exercis'd in &s;hooting with the Bowe, and ca&s;ting the Dart. The&s;e two Exerci&s;es are much practis'd every <HI>Friday,</HI> in a place of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> appointed for that Diverti&s;ement. Thus have you, in few words, an account of whatever relates to the principal Charges of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by tho&s;e who have pa&s;s'd through the Chambers of the <HI>Ichoglans.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Black,</HI> or <HI>Negro-Eunuchs&punc;</HI> of whom I have but a word more to &s;ay, additio|nally to what I have intimated before, are appointed to guard the Appartment of the Women, and they make choice, for that Office, of the mo&s;t deform'd and the mo&s;t <HI>Ae&s;opical,</HI> that can be found. They are all cut even with the belly, ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Second, who being one day in the fields, and &s;eeing a Gelding offering to leap a Mare, inferr'd thence, that the Eunuchs, who Kept his Wives, might likewi&s;e endeavour to &s;atisfie their pa&s;&s;ions; for which he bethought him&s;elf of a pre&s;ent remedy, by ordering them to have all cut off; and his Succe&s;&s;ors have &s;ince ob&s;erv'd that Rule. There is a great number of tho&s;e <HI>Negro-Eunuchs,</HI> and they have their variety of Chambers, and their Regulations, as the white ones have. I &s;ay nothing here of their different Employments, and the Reader will find, in the Chap|ter concerning the Appartment of the Women, all can be known, that's certain upon that Subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The credit and wealth of the <HI>Ki&s;lar-Aga&s;i,</HI> who keeps the Appartment of the Women.</NOTE> The <HI>Ki&s;lar-Aga&s;i,</HI> or, as others name him, the <HI>Kuezer-Aga&s;i</HI> which is as much, in our Language, as to &s;ay, <HI>the Guardian of the Virgins,</HI> is the chiefe&s;t of all the <HI>Negro-Eunuchs,</HI> and is of equal authority and credit with the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who is the Supreme of the <HI>white Eunuchs.</HI> The former is the Over&s;eer of the Appartment of the Wo|men, has the Keys of the Doors in his cu&s;tody, and has acce&s;s to the Emperor when he plea&s;es him&s;elf. The charge he is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of brings him in Pre&s;ents from all parts; and there are not any &s;uch made to the Sultanne&s;&s;es, by the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and other Per|&s;ons, who &s;tand in need of their favour, in reference to the Sultan, but there comes along with it one to him&s;elf, which makes him one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble Officers, belonging to the Seraglio.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>Azamoglans,</HI> who make the &s;econd Order of young Lads, wherewith the Seraglio is repleni&s;h'd, and out of who&s;e number they take &s;uch as are de&s;ign'd for mean Officers, of whom I &s;hall give you the Li&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Azamoglans</HI> as well as the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> are, as I &s;aid before, Tributary Children, taken away from the Chri&s;tians or made Captives, by Sea, or Land. They make choice of the hand&s;ome&s;t, the be&s;t &s;hap'd, and mo&s;t robu&s;t, for the Seraglio, and they have neither wages nor allowances of any profit, unle&s;s they be advanc'd to &s;ome &s;mall Employments. Nor can they attain tho&s;e, till after many years Ser|vices, and what is then allow'd them does not amount to above four A&s;pers and a half <HI>per diem.</HI> As for tho&s;e who are brought up in other places, under the &s;imple denomination of <HI>Azamoglans,</HI> and are not receiv'd into the Seraglio at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> their fortune can amount no higher, than to become <HI>Zanizaries.</HI></P>
<P>When the&s;e young Boys are brought up to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the fir&s;t di&s;tribution which is made of them is into the Seraglio's, or Royal Hou&s;es of the Grand Seignor: there are &s;ome of them left in the City, to be put to Trades, and others are &s;ent to Sea, to &s;erve for &s;eamen, and &s;o gain experience in Navigation, by which means they capaci|tate them&s;elves for &s;ome Employments. But to confine our di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Azamo|glans</HI> receiv'd into the great Seraglio, they are imploy'd in &s;everal Offices, and &s;ome&punc; of them are made <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Capigis,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Atagis,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Halvagis,</HI> and &s;ome, <HI>Baltagis;</HI> which terms I &s;hall explicate to the Reader in as few words as I can.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bo&s;tangis</HI> are they who are employ'd in the Gardens of the Seraglio, out of who&s;e number they take out tho&s;e who are to row in the Grand Seignor's Brigantines, when he has a a mind to divert him&s;elf in fi&s;hing, or take the air upon the Canal. They who thus &s;erve in the Brigantines, and row on the right hand, may be advanc'd to the charge of <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places of the Seraglio: But they who row on the left hand, are capable only of the mean Employments, wich are be&s;tow'd in the Gardens. If it happen that any one of them break his Oar, by &s;trength of rowing in the Grand Seignor's pre&s;ence, his Higne&s;s immediately orders him a gratuity of fifty Crowns;
<PB N="10" REF="279">
and there is al&s;o a certain di&s;tribution made of &s;ome Money to the others, as the Grand Seignor takes his diver&s;ion in the Brigantine. Their greate&s;t Pay, after they have &s;erved &s;ome years, is &s;even A&s;pers and a half <HI>per diem,</HI> be&s;ides clothing and diet, which they all equally have.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi</HI> one of the no|ble&s;t Charges of the Port.</NOTE> The <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi</HI> has the general Intendancy or Over-&s;ight of all the Grand Seignor's Gardens, as well tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> as tho&s;e of the neighbouring Villages, and commands above ten thou&s;and <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> who are employ'd in the culture of them. Though he be taken out of the meane&s;t rank of the <HI>Azamoglans,</HI> yet his power is very great, and his employment one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable about the Court. That gives him acce&s;s to he prince's Per&s;on, to whom he may &s;peak familiarly when he carries him by Sea; for he has his Seat at the Helm of the Brigantine, wherein the Grand Seignor is, who mo&s;t commonly makes u&s;e of him, to carry his Orders to &s;ome <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> when he would have his Head. All the Grandees of the Port &s;tand in Awe of him, and endeavour to gain his Affection by their Pre&s;ents, becau&s;e it lies in his power, to do them either good or bad Offices about the Prince, whom he can di&s;po&s;e as he plea&s;es, when he has him abroad upon the Water.

<P>The <HI>Capigis</HI> are the Porters or Keepers of the Gates of the Seraglio, that is to &s;ay, of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Courts; for the third Gate, which gives enterance into the inner Seraglio, is kept by Eunuchs.

<P>The <HI>Attagis</HI> are the Cooks of the Seraglio, over whom as well as over the <HI>Halvagis,</HI> the <HI>Kilargi-bachi</HI> has full Power.

<P>The <HI>Halvagis</HI> are the Confectioners, of whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more at large el&s;ewhere. They give al&s;o the &s;ame Name to tho&s;e who &s;erve the Grandees of the Seraglio, and are permitted to go out of it and into it, when they plea&s;e.</P>

<P>The <HI>Ekmeggi-bachi</HI> is the Ma&s;ter-Baker, who has the over-&s;ight, and gives di|recti on for the Baking of all the Bread that is Eaten in the Seraglio.

<P>All &s;orts of Per&s;ons, what Religion &s;oever they are of, except the <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> are oblig'd to pay the Tribute without any exception, from the time of their &s;ettling in the Empire, and having attain'd the &s;ixteenth year of their Age.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The policy of the Port, to keep the <HI>Cham</HI> of the le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary</HI> quiet.</NOTE> There are but two Princes in the World that are known by the Name of <HI>Cham,</HI> to wit, the Emperour of great <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the King of the little <HI>Tartary,</HI> a Va&s;&s;al to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchs.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Money current in <HI>Tur|key.</HI></NOTE> THere are but two Species of <HI>Gold-Coins</HI> current all over the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire; the one is the proper Countrey Money, the other comes out of Forein Parts. The former is the <HI>Scherif,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Sequin,</HI> or <HI>Sultanine;</HI> and that kind of Gold is worth at the pre&s;ent &s;ix Franks, <HI>French</HI> Money, though heretofore it yielded but five Franks, nay came &s;o low as four.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gold brought to <HI>Cai|ro</HI> and coin'd there.</NOTE> the <HI>Scheriffs</HI> come from Egypt, and <HI>Cairo</HI> is the only City of the Empire, where Gold is coin'd. That Cold is brought out of the Kingdom of the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines,</HI> and this is the manner how it is brought to <HI>Cairo.</HI> The quantity is not the &s;ame every year, and when the pa&s;&s;ages are &s;hut up, whether by War, or by extraordinary Rains, whereby the Fields are overflown, there comes but little Gold into <HI>Egypt,</HI> during that time. As &s;oon as tho&s;e ob&s;tructions are takn away, and that there is a freedom of Commerce, you &s;hall &s;ee arriving at <HI>Cairo,</HI> nay at <HI>Alexandria</HI> too, &s;everal <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines</HI> who bring in, one man, two pounds, another four, every one more or le&s;s, according to his abilities. Tho&s;e poor People run a thou&s;and ri&s;ques in their Travels, and 'tis almo&s;t a miracle, how they bring them to a period. Some of them are of that Country, whence the Queen of <HI>Shebo</HI> came, and which is now call'd the King|dom of <HI>Sabour.</HI> Others come from places at a greater di&s;tance, and they have &s;ometimes fifteen days journeys to make, and cannot meet with any waters to drink, but what are corrupt, and de&s;tructive to health: which I found but too true my &s;elf, when I cro&s;s'd the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> If by chance they come to &s;ome Cottage or Hut, where they have kill'd an Elephant, it is a place for them to fea&s;t in. This con&s;ider'd, we need not wonder at the &s;hort lives of tho&s;e mi&s;erable People, who&s;e Bodies are de&s;troy'd in tho&s;e Voyages, and who for the mo&s;t part do not exceed forty years of Age. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with tho&s;e, who trade with the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI> on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Melinda</HI> and <HI>Mozambico,</HI> the corrupt waters they are forc'd to drink in their way make them hydropical at five and twenty years of Age, and generally, all the &s;everal peoples of the Kingdom of <HI>Sabour,</HI> have the right Leg &s;well'd' and twice as big as the left, and &s;eldom exceed five and thirty years. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;incerity of the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines.</HI></NOTE></P>

for the Commodity which had been taken up; and it could never hitherto be found, that any Merchant could complain, that ever he had lo&s;t ought by any one of them. All that is to be fear'd, is, that they &s;hould fall into the hands of their Enemies, who rob, and kill them, and particularly on the South-&s;ide, there being le&s;s danger, towards the North.</P>
<P>The forein Coins of Gold in <HI>Turkey</HI> are the <HI>Ducates</HI> of <HI>Germany, Holland, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI> They are very much &s;ought after, and they are chang'd at &s;ix Livers and a half, and &s;ometimes at &s;ix Livers and fifteen Sols; and that is done in order to the &s;ending of them to the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they drive a great Trade with them, as I &s;hall make it appear in my Relations of the Levant. Sometime &s;ince, there has been &s;ome abatement made in the <HI>Discates</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> upon a di&s;covery of their not being of &s;o good an alloy, as tho&s;e of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>There will be often mention made of <HI>Pur&s;es,</HI> in that Relation of the Seraglio. A <HI>Pur&s;e</HI> implies as much as the &s;um of five hundred Crowns, and it is of tho&s;e Pur&s;es that the Grand Seignor makes his ordinary Pre&s;ents. But a <HI>Pur&s;e of Gold,</HI> wherewith he regales his Sultane&s;&s;es, and his peculiar Favourites, amounts to fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Sequins,</HI> or thirty thou&s;and Crowns. A <HI>Kize</HI> is al&s;o a bag of fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Ducates.</HI></P>
<P>In all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, there is not any Money of Copper to be &s;een, and the Spieces current there mu&s;t be either of Silver or Gold. True it is, that there are &s;ome pieces of Silver taken there, of a very ba&s;e alloy, e&s;pecially the <HI>Roup,</HI> which are quar|ter-Ryals, coin'd in <HI>Poland;</HI> and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> in their &s;everal Governments, conterfeit certain forein Coins, which are all much different from tho&s;e which they are intended to imitate.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame as to Silver-Coins in <HI>Turkey,</HI> as it is with tho&s;e of Gold. There are &s;ome coin'd in the Countrey, as the <HI>A&s;per,</HI> and the <HI>Para&s;i,</HI> which are the lea&s;t of all. And there are &s;ome forreign Moneys, as the <HI>Spani&s;h Ryal,</HI> and the <HI>Rix-dollar</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>A&s;per</HI> is the lea&s;t of all the Moneys, which heretofore was worth eight <HI>Deniers, French</HI> Money, that is about two thirds of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Penny, as being of good Silver, and the value &s;et upon them was after the rate of 80, for the Crown-piece. But in the more remote Provinces, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> cau&s;e &s;uch an abundance of counterfeit ones to be made, that at pre&s;ent, a Crown-piece will yield one hundred and twenty <HI>A&s;pers.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trade dri|ven in the five Sols-pieces.</NOTE> A certain Merchant of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> without any fore-thought de&s;ign, &s;ent as many Pieces of <HI>five Sols,</HI> newly come out of the Mint, as amounted to the &s;um of two, or three hundred Crowns among&s;t &s;ome other Pieces of Silver-Coins, to buy Silks. The <HI>Turks</HI> found tho&s;e little Pieces &s;o prety and &s;o beautiful, and were at the fir&s;t &s;o taken therewith, that they thought them to be the eighth part of a <HI>Ryal,</HI> and were content to allow a Crown, for every eight of them. The Factor, perceiving it, writ to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> whence he receiv'd a very great &s;um in that Money, and gain'd very much thereby. If the <HI>French</HI> could have contented them&s;elves with that hone&s;t profit, the commerce of tho&s;e Pieces, which was qua&s;h'd by the exce&s;&s;ive frauds committed in the managment of it, might have continued &s;till, and would have been very advantageous to them. The <HI>Turks</HI> were un|willing to trade in any other kind of Money, and in the payment of the Armies, to give the Souldiers content, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;per&s;ing them among them.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> were not at all &s;atisfy'd with that; and whereas there was a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Grand Vizir</HI>'s Decree, they bethought them&s;elves of having &s;ome of tho&s;e Pieces coin'd, which &s;hould not have above four <HI>Sols</HI> of good Silver, which was a con&s;iderable advantage, of twenty five upon the hundred&punc; They pa&s;s'd well enough for &s;ome time, before the <HI>Turks</HI> had di&s;cover'd the fraud; they being &s;atis|fy'd, that the Stamp was fair, and that he Pieces look'd very white: And the Wo|men and Maidens, of the meaner &s;ort of People, made them contribute to the orna|ment of their Head-tires, about which they fa&s;ten'd tho&s;e pretty little Pieces, and they came down flaping about their Foreheads, as the wealthier &s;ort fa&s;ten'd Pieces of Gold to theirs.</P>
<P>But the better to compa&s;s their de&s;ign, the <HI>French</HI> Merchants were oblig'd to find out other Countreys, where it might be lawful for them to traffick in tho&s;e Pieces. Their fir&s;t recour&s;e was to tho&s;e of <HI>Dombes, Orange,</HI> and <HI>Avignon,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Italy,</HI> they found work for &s;ome time for tho&s;e of <HI>Monaco,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;a.</HI> But having ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Turks</HI> were more taken with the Pieces which had the impre&s;&s;ion of a Woman's Head, and tho&s;e Princes being unwilling to &s;uffer them to coin among them any Money of &s;o ba&s;e an alloy, or to give it the Stamp of <HI>Ja,</HI> the Prince&s;s of <HI>Dombes,</HI> they ca&s;t their eyes upon &s;ome Ca&s;tles &s;ituate within the Terri|tories of the <HI>Genue&s;es,</HI> yet &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the Empire, where they obtain'd what they de&s;ir'd, upon conditions not di&s;advantageous to the Lords of tho&s;e places. The Pieces they got coin'd at <HI>Orange,</HI> where al&s;o &s;ought after, and pleas'd the <HI>Turks,</HI> in regard the Stamp was beautiful, and very clear; but tho&s;e of the Legat of <HI>Avignon</HI> were not &s;o current, the Effigies thereof not being well done, and the Cro&s;s, hanging at the Neck, di&s;plea&s;ing to the <HI>Turks.</HI> Had they contented them&s;elves, in that Tade, with twenty five upon the hundred, it might have continu'd and the profit would have been con&s;iderable: but by little and lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">le, the thing came to &s;o great an exce&s;s, till, at la&s;t, there was not one penny-worth of good Silver in every piece.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> to make them pa&s;s the better, gave eighteen, and &s;ometimes twenty for a Crown, of which abu&s;e the great Merchants of <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Aleppo, Smyrna,</HI> and other Cities of Trade, made a good hand, they giving but twelve or thirteen for the worth of a Crown, in the payments they made to the petty Merchants of the Provinces of the Empire, for the Merchandizes they brought out of <HI>Turkey,</HI> there was none of that counterfeit Money di&s;pers'd, and the <HI>Armenians</HI> were far enough from burthening them&s;elves with it, in regard that all the Money, which is carried into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is pre&s;ently convey'd to the Mints, upon the Frontiers, to be melted down, and afterwards coin'd into <HI>Aba&s;&s;is,</HI> whereof they give the Merchant an account, an&s;werably to the Standard of his Money, after it has been examin'd; and by that means there can be no fraud committed. The &s;ame cour&s;e is taken over all the Great <HI>Mogol's</HI> Empire; and of all the Princes in the World, he cau&s;es all the Species of Gold and Silver of the be&s;t Standard to be coin'd without admitting the lea&s;t alloy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The jealou&s;ie of the other Mer|chants.</NOTE> The <HI>Genue&s;e</HI> Merchants perceiving that the <HI>French</HI> had, at the beginning been fortunate in their Commerce, would needs imitate them in other &s;orts of Money, and got two or three hundred thou&s;and <HI>Ducates</HI> coin'd which they carried into <HI>Turkey.</HI> But they had not the &s;ucce&s;s they expected, the Gold was &s;o counterfeit, that the cheat was immediately di&s;cover'd, the Con&s;ul, and the Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el, were in &s;ome trouble about it, and the per&s;ons concern'd therein, &s;av'd what they could of that di&s;a&s;ter.</P>

<P>But to return to the <HI>French,</HI> the fir&s;t concern'd in this Hi&s;tory, to which it is time to put a period. In the heat of their Commerce, and while all things were very well with them, they thought it not enough, to carry away the riche&s;t Merchan|dizes, but they al&s;o bought up all &s;orts of good Money they could meet withal, and brought it into <HI>France,</HI> to carry on and continue the coinage of their counterfeit pieces. This Trade was carry'd on &s;o far, thro' the whole extent of that va&s;t Empire, and there was &s;o prodigious a quantity of that counterfeit Mony &s;pread abroad, that it was found by the Regi&s;ter-Books of the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms, that the &s;um of what had been di&s;pers'd of it amounted to an hundred and four&s;core millions of Livers, not accounting what had never come to their knowledge, and what Sea|men, and other private Per&s;ons might have conceal'd.</P>

<P>Yet could not that crying of them down, and the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s prohibition make the Souldiers who &s;erv'd in <HI>Candia,</HI> out of love with tho&s;e little pieces, the beauty whereof they were &s;o much taken withal. Notwith&s;tanding all the Remon&s;trances that could be made to them, they would not be paid in any other kind of Money; and &s;ome di&s;contented Per&s;ons and Mutineers beginning to &s;hew their Teeth, they were forced immediately to &s;end Galleys to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and &s;ome other Cities of great Commerce, to bring away all that could be found of that &s;ort of money. The incredible quantity of tho&s;e counterfeit pieces, di&s;pers'd in all the Provinces of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, is at la&s;t vani&s;h'd, they are grown red, and no longer current.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A mi&s;chievous fraud gently puni&s;hed.</NOTE> At the Fir&s;t crying down of that counterfeit money, before the news of it could have been brought to foreign Countries, a certain Per&s;on named <HI>Goulin,</HI> engag'd all he had in the world, to make up to the &s;um of five and twenty thou&s;and Crowns in tho&s;e Pieces of <HI>five Sols,</HI> &s;o extremely fal&s;ifyd, that there was hardly &s;o much Sil|ver as was requi&s;ite to whiten them. He came to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where I then was, and where he &s;oon found, that there was no way to put off his counterfit Merchandize. Whereupon he imagin'd, that he might get it off, if he could make a &s;peedy Voyage to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where, as he had been a&s;&s;ur'd, &s;ome Per&s;ons took them, even after they had been cry'd down. Being unwilling to hazard all by Sea, he &s;ent away, by Land, four or five thou&s;and Crowns, which were taken away by Thieves, near <HI>Bur&s;a,</HI> and carry'd the much greater part to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, of which he had al&s;o &s;ufficient cau&s;e to repent him. After he had expos'd it at the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, for the payment of the Duties, the Chief Officer of the Cu&s;toms told him, that he might return within two or three days, to take back what belong'd to him; and as &s;oon as the other was gone, he cau&s;d all to be melted down in his pre&s;ence. The &s;eperation being made, upon twenty thou&s;and Crowns, which was the &s;um he had brought thither, there was not the full fourth part of Silver, and the Merchant coming again to the Cu&s;tomer, fell down all along, out of pure fear le&s;t a &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment might follow the fraud whereof he was vi&s;ibly convicted, &s;eeing &s;o much &s;cum of bra&s;s on the one &s;ide, and &s;o little &s;ilver on the other.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The origine of the word <HI>Sera|glio,</HI> common to all the Royal Hou&s;es in <HI>Tur|key</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> THE Grand Seignor's Seraglio, whereof I undertake to give a De&s;cripti|on, is the Palace where the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Princes ordinarily keep their Court. All the Royal Hou&s;es, as well in <HI>Turkey,</HI> as <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> have the &s;ame Name, which derives it Origine from the word <HI>Serrai,</HI> which &s;ignifies a great Noble Hou&s;e, in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language. The Grand Seignor has many Seraglio's in the Provinces of his Empire, and the principal of them are tho&s;e of <HI>Bur&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Adrianople,</HI> two Re&s;idences which that Monarch does ordinarily make u&s;e of, according to the conjuncture of his Affairs.</P>
<P>But to confine our &s;elves to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> we find there three Seraglio's, which have all their different Beauties. The old Seraglio is the Palace appointed for the retirement of tho&s;e Women who have &s;erv'd the Predece&s;&s;ors of the Prince Regent, and whence they never get out, unle&s;s it be in order to Marriage. The Grand Seignor goes thither but very &s;eldome, and that when he is out of humor, to pa&s;s away &s;ome days there in &s;olitude. The Seraglio of the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI> &s;o called from the Exerci&s;es done there on Hor&s;e-back, which was built by <HI>Ibrahim Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> Son-in-Law, and Favourite to the Emperour <HI>Solyman</HI> the Second, &s;erves now for an Amphitheatre for publick Fe&s;tivals, Exerci&s;es, Combats, Carou&s;els, and particularly for the Circumci&s;ion of the <HI>Ottomon</HI> Princes, which is their greate&s;t Solemnity. The third is the Grand Seraglio, whereof I make the Relation, and to which that Name is principally attributed, &s;o as that there needs not
<PB N="18" REF="283">
any thing el&s;e to be added thereto, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the others. I &s;hall have but little to &s;ay concerning the Structures of it, wherein there is not any thing extraordinary to be ob&s;erv'd, but &s;hall rather in&s;i&s;t upon what is privately done, in each Apartment of that great Palace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The admirable &s;ituation of the Seraglio of <HI>Con+&s;tantinople.</HI></NOTE> The Grand Seraglio is a va&s;t place inclos'd, which reaches to that point of Land where the ancient <HI>Byzantium</HI> was built, upon the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the joyning together of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea and the <HI>Euxine,</HI> which contribute &s;o much to the Beauty and Wealth of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> This great City, let the Wind &s;it where it will, does every hour receive &s;ome refre&s;hments or other, from one of tho&s;e Seas; and the Seraglio advancing it &s;elf into the Channel, which makes a communica|tion between them, receives the fir&s;t Advantages that may be derived thence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its extent, fi|gure, and exter|nals.</NOTE> That great Inclo&s;ure makes a Triangle, one &s;ide whereof is to the Land-&s;ide, and reaches to the City, and the two others lye open to the Sea and a River which falls into it. This Triangle is unequal, and if it be divided into eight parts, that &s;ide towards the Land takes up three of them, and the five others are for the two &s;ides abutting on the Sea. Its compa&s;s is about three <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, or one of our common Leagues. And this Palace is &s;urrounded all about with high and &s;trong Walls, flank'd on the Sea-&s;ide with &s;quare Towers, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance one from another; and towards the City, with round Tow|ers, which are at a nearer di&s;tance one from another, from the great Gate of the Seraglio, which is towards St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> as far as the Sea where you Embark for <HI>Galata.</HI> In tho&s;e Towers, in the Night-time, there are Guards of the <HI>Azamoglans,</HI> to &s;ee that no body approaches the Seraglio by Sea or Land; and if occa&s;ion re|quire, they may fire &s;ome Pieces of Artillery, which &s;tand always loaden upon a Quay of five fathom breadth, which is carried quite about the Seraglio.</P>
<P>Upon one of tho&s;e Towers, about a hundred paces from the great Gate of the Seraglio, as you go down, in order to your pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>Galata,</HI> they have wrought a Clo&s;et, into which the Grand Seignor goes &s;ometimes to divert him&s;elf, and to &s;ee People pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, without being &s;een him|&s;elf. Somewhat lower, and upon the Sea-&s;ide, there is a &s;pacious place cover'd over, under which, as if it were in a little Haven, they keep the Caicks or Brigantines, wherein the Prince takes his diverti&s;ement by Water, when he is pleas'd to do it.</P>
<P>Not far thence, within the inclo&s;ure of the Seraglio, are the Habitations of the <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> who are entru&s;ted with the conduct of the Brigantines; and at a little farther di&s;tance, in your way to the point of the Seraglio, which is towards <HI>Scudaret,</HI> &s;tands the Quarter of the <HI>Bo&s;tanchi-bachi,</HI> Over&s;eer of the Gardens of the Seraglio, and of all the other Gardens belonging to the Grand Seignor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Artillery out of order, and the Gun|ners not well skill'd.</NOTE> Upon the Quay, which as I told you, does &s;urround the Walls of the Seraglio, there are forty or fifty pieces of Cannon of different bigne&s;s, and there are &s;ome of &s;o great a bore, that a man might get into them. Oppo&s;ite thereto, and in the middle of the Channel, there is a Tower built upon a Rock, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Qui&s;ler houle&s;i,</HI> or the <HI>Tower of the Virgins.</HI> It is kept by <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> and has its Guns levell'd with the Water, which better defend the Streight, than tho&s;e at the point of the Seraglio, which for the mo&s;t part are without Carriages, and un&s;erviceable. Be&s;ides, they want good Gunners, and if all that Artillery were well mounted, and manag'd by skilful Per&s;ons, it would better keep in awe, whatever comes out of the <HI>Mediterranian,</HI> and the <HI>Black Sea.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A plea&s;ant abode, but re|&s;traint makes it otherwi&s;e.</NOTE> We have &s;poken &s;ufficiently of the external parts, 'tis time we now enter into the Seraglio, and rather con&s;ider what pa&s;&s;es in every Appartment of it, than the Structures thereof, wherein, as I &s;aid, there is not any thing of Magni|ficence, whatever &s;ome Per&s;ons might invent, who in my pre&s;ence, have made noble Draughts of it, grounded on their own pure Imaginations. I have &s;een as much of the Seraglio, as a Stranger could do, and I have &s;een it &s;everal times, in &s;everal Voyages, having had time enough to con&s;ider the two fir&s;t Courts, the Divan, and the Hall of Audience, but cannot celebrate them much for any great Beauty I could find in them. There is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, abundance of Marble and Porphyry in all the Apartments; but on the other &s;ide, all tho&s;e Apart|ments are confu&s;edly &s;huffled together; there is no regularity at all; mo&s;t of the Rooms have but little light, and all the Ornament of them con&s;i&s;ts in Rich
<PB N="19" REF="283">
Tapi&s;try lay'd all over the Floors thereof, and &s;ome Cu&s;hions of Gold and Silver Brokado, &s;ome whereof are embroider'd with Pearls. But taking things generally, if the Walls and the Towers, which inclo&s;e the Seraglio, look more like a frightful Pri&s;on, than a Royal Palace, the Apartments whereof it con|&s;i&s;ts, have not al&s;o that Wealth or Plea&s;ure, for which the Palaces of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> are &s;o highly celebrated, and they offer not any thing which may long enter|tain the &s;ight of a curious Per&s;on. All that can make the Seraglio a plea&s;ant place of Abode, is the advantage of its &s;ituation, and indeed a Nobler cannot be imagin'd. For it looks towards the Ea&s;t, and takes up the upper part, and the de&s;cent of a &s;loping Hillock, from St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> quite to the Channel. The Buil|dings are upon the mo&s;t eminent places, and have a Pro&s;pect into the Gar|dens, which run along the de&s;cent, as al&s;o into the two Seas which meet at the point of the Seraglio, whence the Grand Seignor may at the &s;ame time &s;ee <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in both which parts of the World, his Territories are very great. But never was any Pri&s;on thought a plea&s;ant place, and there are few in the Se|raglio, who rather would live in a Hut, and have their Liberty, than be con|tinually confin'd in a Palace under &s;uch &s;evere Di&s;cipline.</P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="284">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Regulati|ons of the Infir|mary of the Se|raglio.</NOTE> On the right hand of that fir&s;t Court, there runs all along a &s;pacious &s;tructure, containing &s;everal Appartments or Chambers, and &s;erving for an Infirmary to the whole Seraglio. The Gate of it is kept by an Eunuch, who has under him a great many People, employ'd in attending on, and mini&s;tring to the &s;ick, whom, an|&s;werably to their quality, they di&s;po&s;e into convenient quarters in that hou&s;e, where they may be better a&s;&s;i&s;ted, then in tho&s;e which their indi&s;po&s;ition had oblig'd them to quit. The two principal Phy&s;itians, and the two principal Chirurgeons, whom they call <HI>Hequinz-bachi,</HI> and <HI>Geirah-bachi,</HI> make their vi&s;its there every day, at cer|tain hours. A man cannot imagin a place better order'd and regulated then that is: and the Grand Seignor him&s;elf &s;ometimes comes thither in per&s;on to take an exact account of the Sick and their condition, as al&s;o to enquire whether they are well treated, whether the Phy&s;itians vi&s;it them often, and whether every Officer of the Infirmary perform the duty incumbent on him. There is &s;eldom any place void in that Hou&s;e, for as &s;oon as one is gone out, another comes in: and though it be de&s;ign'd only for &s;uch as are &s;ick, yet &s;everal per&s;ons, who are well, are brought thither, under pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition, or to enjoy them&s;elves a while, or to weather out &s;ome trouble or di&s;content. They continue there for the &s;pace of ten or twelve daies, and are diverted, according to their mode, with a wretched kind of vocal and in&s;trumental Mu&s;ick, which begins betimes in the morning, and holds on till night. The permi&s;&s;ion they have there to drink wine, which they never have el&s;where, is a greater inducement for their coming in thither than the mu&s;ick. But that per|mi&s;&s;ion, which, they would as 'twere conceale, and which the &s;uper&s;tition of the <HI>Turks</HI> dares not publickly own, is accompany'd by a thou&s;and difficulties. They are not permitted to bring in any wine in the &s;ight of the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> who &s;tands at the entrance of the place: and if any one &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd in the doing of it, his puni&s;hment would be to receive three hundred ba&s;tinadoes, and a penalty of three hundred <HI>A&s;pers,</HI> to be paid to tho&s;e from whom he had receiv'd them. But if he can cunningly get in with the Wine not having been &s;topp'd at the Gate, a&s;&s;oon as he is got in, he runs no ri&s;que at all, and may drink of it without fear of any cha&s;ti&s;ement, though 'twere in the pre&s;ence of the Grand Seignor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of getting wine into the Infir|mary.</NOTE> The &s;mall quantity of Wine which can be got in by this way, would &s;ignifie but little among &s;o many People, if there were not &s;ome other le&s;s difficult contrivances to &s;upply them therewith. And this is one of them. The Infirmary adjoins to one &s;ide of the Gardens, from which it is &s;eparated only by a wall which is not very high; &s;o that the <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> who find that wine goes off at a good rate, and that they who are within the Seraglio know not how to &s;pend their money, do, in the night time, by ropes convey over the wall, &s;o many Borrachoes or Bags of Buck-Skins, full of wine, containing forty or fifty quarts, which &s;ome other per|&s;ons of the Infirmary &s;tand ready to receive. This way brings in abundance of wine, but not without fear of being &s;uppriz'd by the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi,</HI> who goes the rounds every night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ubtilty of &s;ome per&s;ons to be receiv'd in, though not &s;ick.</NOTE> Nor is the drinking of Wine the main inducement which makes tho&s;e counterfeit &s;ick per&s;ons to &s;eek out pretences, to go and pa&s;s away &s;ome daies in the Infirmary; in&s;omuch that &s;ome have the lewd artifice to put them&s;elves into a &s;light Feaver, which is pre&s;ently remov'd.

<P>For though the Grand Seignor be him&s;elf &s;ubject to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, the very name whereof cau&s;es a horror, yet he orders cruel puni&s;hments to be inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hall pre&s;ume to imitate him.

But in the Infirmary, all the&s;e precautions prove fruitle&s;s; the <HI>Eunuchs</HI> belonging to that place being corrupted partly by pre&s;ents, partly by treats, or being made drunk with wine, or &s;ome other liquors, they bring in thither &s;ome young lads, of whom there is great &s;tore in the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The better to over-reach the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> they put tho&s;e young lads into the habits of the <HI>Halvagis,</HI> and &s;o the cheat &s;ucceeds, in regard they are the Attendants on the Officers of the Seraglio, and all the Errands they have to do in the City.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of or|dering the <HI>Pi|lau.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Turks,</HI> and generally all the Inhabitants of the Ea&s;tern Parts, make the <HI>Pilau</HI> after this manner. According to the quality of the per&s;ons who are to be entertain'd, and the quantity which is to be made of it, you take either a piece of Mutton alone, or together with that &s;ome Pullets or Pidgeons, which are to be boyl'd in a Pot, till they are half done, or &s;omewhat more. When you think them &s;o far boyl'd then pour out both Meat and Broath into a Ba&s;in, and the Pot being wa&s;h'd, put it on the Fire again with Butter in it, which they &s;uffer to melt, till &s;uch time as it is very hot. Then they chop the meat which had been but half-boyl'd, into little pieces, the Pullets into quarters, and the Pidgeons into halves, and &s;o they ca&s;t it into the Butter, they frica&s;s it till it be of a very brown colour. The Rice being well wa&s;h'd they put &s;ome into the Pot over the meat, as much as they think fitting, and the Broath which had been pour'd into the Ba&s;in, they al&s;o put it into the Pot Ladle-ful after Ladle-ful, over the Rice, till &s;uch time as it &s;tands two fingers breadth above it. Then is the Pot immediately cover'd, there is a clear Fire made under it, and they ever and anon take out &s;ome grains of the Rice, to &s;ee if it be &s;oftned, as al&s;o whe|ther it be not requi&s;ite to put in &s;ome more of the Broath to compleat the &s;tewing of it. For it is not like the Rice brought into our parts, which pre|&s;ently breaks a&s;under, but their Rice is of &s;uch a kind, that it mu&s;t be fully boyl'd and yet the Grain entire, as well as the whole Pepper wherewith they &s;ea&s;on it. As &s;oon as it is come to that condition, they cover the Pot with a Cloth three or four times doubled, and &s;et the Pot-lid upon that, and &s;ometime after they make another melting of Butter, till it be very red; to be ca&s;t into the holes, which are made in the Rice with the handle of the Ladle, after which they cover it again of a &s;udden, and &s;o let it &s;tand &s;oaking a while, and then &s;erve it up. It is put into large Di&s;hes with the Meat, hand&s;omly di&s;pos'd upon it, and &s;ome part will be white, that is, continu'd in its natural colour, &s;ome part yellow, occa&s;ion'd by a little mixture of Saffron, and a third part of a Carnation-colour; done by the tincture of the juyce of Pomegranate. Nay, though the meat be as fat as is requi&s;ite for the ordering of this Di&s;h, yet to make the <HI>Pilau</HI> more delicate and palateable to them, they be&s;tow three pound of Butter on &s;ix pound of Rice, which makes it &s;o extraordinary fat, that it di&s;gu&s;ts, and is nau&s;eous to tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tom'd thereto, and accor|dingly would rather have the Rice it &s;elf &s;imply boyl'd with Water and Salt. There are always two or three Di&s;hes &s;erv'd up after that manner, to the Grandees of the Port, who for the mo&s;t part, keep open Table, and in&s;tead of Fle&s;h they cover them with a great Aumelet or Omelet, made with good Herbs, and about three fingers thick, or with &s;ome poach'd Eggs, which are neatly di&s;pos'd about it. A man is never incommodated by this kind of Rice, but the other, which is too fat, is not fit for tho&s;e who drink Wine, and will not excite in them a de&s;ire to Eat of it often.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A particular way of roa&s;ting in the <HI>Levant.</HI></NOTE> Since I have given you an account how they order the <HI>Pilau,</HI> I cannot for|bear making you a further di&s;covery of the <HI>Turks</HI> management of the Kitchin, and telling you how they roa&s;t their meat. The greater &s;ort of meat, as Sheep and Lambs are roa&s;ted whole in Ovens made in the Floor, wherein they hang them by the heads, and they are taken out thence as it were brown-bak'd and Cook'd well enough, &s;o as to excite Appetite.

The Tayls of the Lambs, having not &s;o much fat, are excel|lent meat, and in a manner as delicate as the Sweet-breads of Veal. The&s;e Lambs being thus roa&s;ted, are always &s;erv'd up with Rice under them, and for the

greater Tables, they &s;erve up two of them in a Di&s;h. So that there is no u&s;e of Spits in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Kitchins but what is for Poultry or Fowl, which they order &s;o untowardly, that when they are brought up to the Table they appear &s;o mangled and di&s;order'd, that it is no ea&s;ie matter to di&s;tingui&s;h the head from the feet. But it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Pilau,</HI> and all &s;orts of Fle&s;h-meat, are not &s;erv'd up, but only at Supper, about five of the Clock in the Evening; and that in the Morning tho&s;e of better Quality Eat only Sallets, Herbs, Fruits, and Con&s;erves; the meaner &s;ort of People contenting them&s;elves with meats made of Milk, Melons and Cucumbers, according to the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>As for Fi&s;h, the <HI>Turks</HI> care not much for it, and though the Seas and Rivers are well repleni&s;h'd therewith, yet they &s;eldom Eat of them. It &s;eldome hap|pens al&s;o, that any Veni&s;on or Wild-Fowl comes into their hou&s;es, as being <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave an aver&s;ion for the Hare.</NOTE>a kind of meat they do not any way reli&s;h, But above all meats they have an aver&s;ion for the Hare; which Ob&s;ervation I made al&s;o in the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who are of a per&s;wa&s;ion, that the Female of that Creature has its Monthly Cour&s;es regularly, as the Woman hath.

They make another &s;ort of it, which is highly in e&s;teem, and that is made with the water de&s;till'd from the flower of a Plant, which grows in Pools and Rivers, and has the figure of a Hor&s;e-&s;hooe.

'Tis a great low Hall, cover'd with Lead, and wain&s;cotted and gilt in &s;ome places within, from which it derives a little Orna|ment. The Floor of it is cover'd with a great Carpet, and there are &s;ome Benches for the Officers, of whom that Council con&s;i&s;ts, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Divan.</HI> There are, as I told you, Galleries of all the &s;ides of that Court, which makes it look as it were like a Cloi&s;ter; and 'tis under that Gallery which is on the right hand; that the <HI>Janizaries</HI> have their Station, while the <HI>Divan</HI> is &s;itting.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es &s;oon de|cided.</NOTE> Ju&s;tice is there exactly admini&s;tred to any one that de&s;ires it, and for what cau&s;e &s;oever it be, &s;o, as that the differing Parties have no need either of Proctors or Advocates, Names not known in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and the Per&s;ons concern'd are to lay open their Ca&s;es them&s;elves. There is no talk of delays, or putting off from one time to another; People &s;hall not langui&s;h in Expectation, but the bu&s;ine&s;s is decided immediately, what nature &s;oever it may be of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;on of that Expediti|on of ju&s;tice.</NOTE> Though this Cu&s;tom be very commendable, yet can it not be &s;o well practis'd among&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;tand upon the property of what they have, and that is deriv'd by inheritance from &s;ome to others, and the litigious partitions of them do many times engage the Proprietors thereof in long Suits of Law. 'Tis quite otherwi&s;e among&s;t the Great Officers of the Port, who are all Slaves, either taken in War, or &s;ent up, as Pre&s;ents, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Ba&s;&s;a's, and Governours of Provinces. All their E&s;tates, when they die, return to the Grand Seignor, from whom they had receive'd them, &s;o that it is a perpetual Circulation, and their Children, as I told you in the begining of this di&s;cour&s;e, are brought up to the Seraglio, to be educated there, and that without any hope of ever &s;ucceeding their Parents, either in their E&s;tates, or Employments. The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchy has always ob&s;erv'd this &s;ubtle Policy, not to permit that any Family &s;hould aggrandize it &s;elf, and be powerful from Father to Son: but they bring it down, as &s;oon as they have rais'd it up, and timely enough deprive them of the means whereby they might create Factions, to the di&s;turbance of the State. Thence it comes, that, be&s;ides the Royal Family of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> they know not what Gentility, and antiquity of Extraction means; there's no emulation upon that &s;core, Charges and Dignities are be&s;tow'd an&s;werabl to the Merit of the Per&s;on, without any con&s;ideration of his Extraction. Nay, it &s;ometimes happens, that the Principal Mini&s;ters of the Empire are the Sons of Cow-keepers, as was one <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> a Grand Vizir, who made &s;o much noi&s;e under the Reign of <HI>Solyman.</HI> And &s;o, being not any way oblig'd to their Birth, they acknowledge their Fortunes to be the reward of their Education.</P>
<P>But to return to the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice among&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> Tho&s;e who make the Law their profe&s;&s;ion, and are look'd upon as the Clergy of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> leave no place for &s;uits at Law; every one knows his priviledges, and what belongs to the function of his Charge, and there ari&s;e no differences among them, becau&s;e all things are perfectly well regulated.</P>
<P>In like manner, the people are ignorant what pleading &s;ignifies. There's no occa&s;ion for publick Notaries, in order to Matrimonial Contracts; There's no great &s;ums given with a daughter, and the jewels and cloaths which &s;he can get out of her Fathers hou&s;e, are all the portion &s;he brings to her Husband. And this, in few words, is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Turks</HI> can put an expeditious end to all their affairs, without giving any toleration to that pettifogging, which, among Chri&s;tians, proves the ruine of &s;o many People.</P>
<P>The Officers, who &s;it in the <HI>Divan</HI> are, fir&s;t, the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> the Lieutenant-General of the whole Empire, who is Pre&s;ident of it, and repre&s;ents the Grand Seignor's Per&s;on; Then the &s;ix other <HI>Vizirs;</HI> Then the <HI>Cadile&s;quers</HI> of <HI>Romania</HI> and <HI>Natolia,</HI> who are the Judges and Intendants of the Armies; Then the three <HI>Tefterdars,</HI> or Trea&s;urers-General; Then the <HI>Ni&s;&s;angibacha,</HI> the Lord Chancellour; And the <HI>Netangi,</HI> who is as 'twere the Secretary of State, with &s;ome Clerks, or Notaries. All the&s;e Officers come into the <HI>Divan</HI>-Hall, at four in the Morning, and continue there till Noon, to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice. The <HI>Chiaoux-bachi</HI> has his &s;tation at the Gate, with a troop of tho&s;e that are under his charge, to execute the Grand <HI>Vizir's</HI> Orders, and has a &s;ilver-rod in his hand, as a badge of his Authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The care taken to prevent the revolt of the <HI>Janizaries.</HI></NOTE> On tho&s;e days that the <HI>Divan</HI> &s;its, the Officers are enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tain'd at dinner in the &s;ame Hall, which is done with much Sobriety, and little Ceremony.

There are carried al&s;o me&s;&s;es of <HI>Chourba</HI> which is a kind of pottage made with Rice, for the dinners of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are in their &s;tations, under the Galleries. But if it happen that they are in a mutinous humour, and incens'd again&s;t a <HI>Vizir,</HI> or again&s;t the Grand Seignor him&s;elf, not one of them will put his hand to the <HI>Chourba;</HI> but

they &s;cornfully thru&s;t back the di&s;hes, and by that action di&s;cover their di&s;|content.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignor is pre&s;ently advertis'd of it, and &s;ends to them the <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i,</HI> Grand Ma&s;ter of the Seraglio, to know what their plea&s;ure is, and what they de&s;ire. Then they depute one of their own Body to go, and &s;peak on the behalf of them all, and that per&s;on whi&s;pering the <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i</HI> in the Ear, declares to him the oc|ca&s;ion of their di&s;content.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Grand Seignor is pre|&s;ent at the <HI>Di|van.</HI></NOTE> Sunday and Tue&s;day are the principal days of the <HI>Divan,</HI> and then it is properly a Council of State, and of publick affairs. The Grand Seignor mo&s;t commonly a&s;&s;i&s;ts at it, but is not &s;een; and that keeps in awe as well the Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> as the other Officers. He can come thither from his own Appartment, through a clo&s;e Gallery, and &s;eat him&s;elf at a window, which looks into the <HI>Divan</HI>-Hall, and has always a velvet Curtain before it, which he draws when he plea&s;es, and e&s;pecially when he perceives that they have not done Ju&s;tice. I &s;hall produce here, an example, famous enough as to that particular, which happen'd in the Reign of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> the Father of <HI>Amurath</HI> and one of the ju&s;te&s;t Princes, that ever the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire had.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bold action of a <HI>Timer-Spahi,</HI> who kills a Grand Vi&s;ir, and is pardon'd.</NOTE> The Reader is to call to mind, what I &s;aid at the beginning concerning the <HI>Timar-Spahi,</HI> on whom they be&s;tow, during their lives, the Government and revenue of &s;ome Town, according as they have de&s;erv'd by their Services. The <HI>Saphi,</HI> who&s;e &s;tory I am going to relate, had a <HI>Timar,</HI> between <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Damas,</HI> which might bring him in a revenue of fifteen hundred Crowns. The Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> either out of &s;ome aver&s;ion to the <HI>Spahi,</HI> or upon &s;ome fal&s;e reports which had been made of him, and which he had been too forward to believe, without taking an exact informati|on of things, took away from him the <HI>Timar,</HI> whereof he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and be&s;tow'd it on one of his own Creatures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spahi,</HI> finding him&s;elf &s;o unju&s;tly di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd comes to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> enters into the <HI>Divan,</HI> and pre&s;ents a Petition to the Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> wherein he remon&s;trates to him his long Services, and how he never was chargeable with any negligence of his duty. The Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> having read it, tears it in his pre&s;ence, which was to &s;ignifie as much, as that he would not an&s;wer it, and that there was nothing for for the <HI>Spahi</HI> to hope for. The Petitioner withdrew, without &s;aying any thing: but &s;ome days afterwards, he returns to the <HI>Divan,</HI> and pre&s;ents a &s;econd Petition, which the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> likewi&s;e tears, as he had done the former, without mak|ing any an&s;wer thereto. Upon this &s;econd injury, the <HI>Spahi,</HI> full of fury, and ju&s;t|ly exa&s;perated, draws his Poniard, falls upon the <HI>Vizir,</HI> and kills him.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignor, who was then at the Window, having ob&s;erved that action, draws the Curtain, and with a loud voice commanded that no hurt &s;hould be offer'd to the per&s;on who had done it. He thereupon orders the <HI>Spahi</HI> to approach, and ask'd him the Rea&s;on of his having demean'd him&s;elf with &s;o much violence. The other much a&s;ham'd, humbly makes an&s;wer, but with re&s;olution enough, That he could not forbear doing what he had done, upon the &s;ight of &s;o great a piece of inju&s;tice: and thereupon pre&s;enting to him the Petition, which had been torn to pieces, the Grand Seignor caus'd it to be read, and patiently hearkend to the ju&s;t complaints which it contain'd. Having fully examin'd the Affair, his High|ne&s;s commended the <HI>Spahi</HI> for the Action he had done, u&s;ing the word <HI>Aferim,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>'Tis well done,</HI> and which is ordinary in that Language, when they approve a thing; and thereupon, there was an additional Liberality made by the Grand Seignor to the Command which he gave, that he &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his <HI>Timar.</HI> He thereupon took occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the other <HI>Vizirs,</HI> and to tell them, That that Example &s;hould teach them to do ju&s;t things, and not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o blinded by favour, as not to ob&s;erve Equity. The violent action of the <HI>Spahi</HI> is certainly not to be approv'd, though the inju&s;tice of the <HI>Vizir</HI> was manife&s;t, but the procedure of the Grand Seignor, cannot be look'd on otherwi&s;e then as mo&s;t commendable, and a great Model of perfect Equity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="289">
I &s;hall not think it much, to produce here a &s;econd Example of the exact Ju&s;tice, which the Grand Seignor would have admini&s;tred to the People: and in this Ex|ample there is &s;omething that is &s;ignally remarkeable. A great Stone-Morter, which may be &s;een at the Gate of the <HI>Divan,</HI> &s;erves for a Monumental con|firmation of this Story; and whereas it is accompany'd by many circum&s;tances worthy our ob&s;ervation, I think my &s;elf oblig'd not to conceal them from the Reader.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Sultan <HI>Amurate</HI> di&s;co|ver'd a &s;ecret breach of tru&s;t.</NOTE> In the Reign of Sultan <HI>Amurat,</HI> a certain private Per&s;on finding him&s;elf without Wife of Children, re&s;olv'd to undertake the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha.</HI> Before his departure, he conceiv'd, that he could not better di&s;po&s;e what he left behind him that was mo&s;t valuable, then by putting it into the hands of a <HI>Hoggia,</HI> a Doctor of the Law. He thereupon left in his cu&s;tody certain Jewels, in a little bag, intreating him to keep them till he return'd, and declaring him his Heir, in ca&s;e he dy'd in his Pilgrimage. It was the Pilgrim's fortune to return &s;afely from <HI>Mecha,</HI> and making no que&s;tion but to get what he had entru&s;ted the <HI>Hoggia</HI> withal, calls for what he had depo&s;ited in his hands. The other makes him a very cold an&s;wer, telling him, That he knew not what he meant, leaving him very much &s;urpriz'd at &s;o unexpected an account of his concerns. The Pilgrim, &s;mothering his di&s;content, and reflecting, that the thing had been done without witne&s;&s;es, did nothing for &s;ome days; but afterwards, he pre&s;ents a Petition to the Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> and acquaints him how all things had pa&s;s'd between him and the Doctor. The Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> perceiving there was a great nicery in that affair, and that the Doctor might ea&s;ily deny a thing which had been tran&s;acted without witne&s;&s;es, bid the Pilgrim have patience a while, and that he would give the Grand Seignor an ac|count of it; which he accordingly did.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignor Commands the <HI>Vizir</HI> to be very circum&s;pect in the manage|ment of that Affair, as being very de&s;ireous to &s;ift out the truth of it, and orders him to &s;end for the Doctor, to make prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip to him, and to put him in hopes of being imployd of things in great importance. Some days pa&s;s on, while the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> minds what Game he had to play. At length, he &s;ends for the Doctor, he commends his ingenuity, and his Conduct; and &s;o putting him into very fair hopes, he promi&s;es him to prevail &s;o far with the Grand Seignor, as that he &s;hould have the honour to ki&s;s his hands, &s;ince it was not ju&s;t, that &s;o tran&s;cen|dent a Wit as he &s;hould be any longer unknown to his Highne&s;s. The Doctor overjoy'd at that di&s;cour&s;e, thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t man in the World, e&s;peci|ally when he &s;aw, that the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> had made him his <HI>Hougia,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, his Almoner. The <HI>Vizir</HI> proceeds, and according to the &s;ecret Orders he had received from the Grand Seignor, gives the Doctor another Employment, which was, that he &s;hould bring him in Report of all the Criminall Affairs which could be pre&s;ented. The Grand Seignor, upon the Report a of the <HI>Hougia,</HI> ask'd him his advice, and what puni&s;hment the guilty Per&s;on de&s;erv'd for the Crime whereof he was convinc'd, the execution being to be done according to the judgment which the Doctor had pa&s;s'd, whom he made his ordinary Reader, and would have near his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Five or &s;ix months pa&s;s on in this manner, ere there could be any di&s;covery made of the fal&s;ify'd Tru&s;t. And it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That the Pilgrim had given the Grand Seignor an exact Inventory of all the &s;everal things, which he had put into the little Bag. Among other things, there was particular mention made of a <HI>Tesbuch</HI> of fine Coral. This <HI>Tesbuch</HI> is a kind of Chapplet, or Sring of Beads, con|&s;i&s;ting of ninty and nine beads, upon each of which, the <HI>Turks</HI> repeat certain words taken out of &s;ome &s;entences of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> That Chaplet is divided into three parts, from thirty three, to thirty three beads, by a little &s;tring, which &s;eparates them: and at the end there hang'd a long piece of Corral, next to which there was another round bead, of the &s;ame material, of an extraordinary bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The more Puritanical &s;ort of <HI>Turks</HI> have their Beads in their hands when they are upon vi&s;its, and e&s;pecially when they approach great Per&s;ons, and that very thing made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the <HI>Hogia</HI>'s theft, and breach of tru&s;t. One day, coming into the Seraglio with his Coral-beads in his hand, the Grand Seignor, before whom he per&s;ented him&s;elf, ca&s;ting his eyes upon them, and per&s;ently imagin|ing, that it might well be the Pilgrim's <HI>Tusbuch,</HI> according to the de&s;cription he
<PB N="31" REF="289">
had given it in the Catalogue of what things were left in the little Bagg, told the Doctor, that he had a great rarity there. The other immediately approaches him, and intreats his Highne&s;s with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to accept of it. The Grand Seignor takes it, and making &s;ome di&s;coveries how acceptable that Pre&s;ent was to him, does by that prudent di&s;&s;imulation, cau&s;e a joy in him, who&s;e Cha&s;ti&s;e|ment he was then contriving.</P>
<P>But that &s;ingle indicium the Grand Seignor does not think enough, but he will have other di&s;coveries; and knowing that among other things that were in the Bag, there was a Ring, the Work of an Excellent and Ancient Ma&s;ter, famous for that &s;ort of Rings which the <HI>Turks</HI> wear on the Thumb, when they &s;hoot with the Long bowe, he expects a &s;econd occa&s;ion, in order to a fuller di&s;covery of the Cheat, and the more ab&s;olute conviction of the Doctor.</P>
<P>'Twas not many days ere that happen'd, by the contrivance of the Emperour him&s;elf, who calling for one of his Pages, one well skill'd&punc; in Archery, went to the place of the <HI>Girit,</HI> where he al&s;o call'd for a Bowe, there being not any Per|&s;on in the whole Empire but was inferiour to him, as to &s;trength and dexterity in the Exerci&s;es of the Bowe and the Dart. When he came to bend the Bowe, he complain'd that the Ring hurt his Thumb, pre&s;uming that the Doctor, who &s;tood near him, and had already pre&s;ented him with the Coral-Beads, would al&s;o make him a proffer of the Ring, which he had of the Pilgrims. Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;ays the Grand Seignor, that there is not at this time any Ma&s;ter living, who can make a Ring any thing like &s;uch a one, whom he nam'd? The Doctor who&s;e apprehen&s;ion was not &s;o good, as to &s;ee that this Trap was laid for his de&s;truction, and thinking to in&s;inuate him&s;elf more and more into the Grand Seignor's Favour, told him, That by good Fortune he had a Ring of that very Ma&s;ter's Work, which he had kept a long time, and that if his Highne&s;s would be pleas'd to Accept of it, he would bring it thither, which he pre&s;ently did.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;on as the Grand Seignor was return'd to his own Quarter, he &s;ent for the Grand Vizier, and the Pilgrim, who came into his pre&s;ence, and he had in his hand the Chaplet of Corral, which he made as if he were repeating, to try whe|ther the Pilgrim would know it again. The other having well ob&s;erv'd it, addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Emperour, &s;aying, If it &s;hall plea&s;e your Highne&s;s to permit me to open my mouth, I dare affirm, that the Chaplet, you have in your hands, is very like that which I have in my little Bag of Jewels, and po&s;&s;ible I &s;hall not be mi&s;taken, if I &s;ay it is the very &s;ame. Whereupon the Grand Seignor commands him to come nearer, and putting the Chaplet, and the Ring into his hands, the Pilgrim affirms, upon his Life, that they are the very &s;ame things, which he had left in the cu&s;tody of the Doctor. He coming the next Morning; according to his cu&s;tom to make a Report of &s;ome Crimi|nal Cau&s;e to the Grand Seignor, that Prince, who was a per&s;on of great Inge|nuity and Apprehen&s;ion, propo&s;es to him a Ca&s;e &s;omewhat of the &s;ame nature with that between him and the Pilgrim, and ask'd him what Puni&s;hment &s;uch a Crime de&s;erv'd. The unfortunate man, blinded by a good fortune wherein he thought him&s;elf well e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and what was pa&s;t being clearly got out of his remembrance, pronounc'd Sentence again&s;t him&s;elf, and an&s;wers the Grand Seignor, That &s;uch a Per&s;on, de&s;erv'd to be pounded alive in a Mortar.</P>
<P>Upon that Sentence, the Emperour caus'd him to be immediately &s;ecur'd, and having order'd all his Che&s;ts to be brought into the Seraglio, by the <HI>Baltagis,</HI> whom he &s;ent to his Lodgings, pulls out of his Pocket the Chaplet of Coral and the Ring, which a Pilgrim of <HI>Mecha</HI> had entru&s;ted him with the cu&s;tody of. He afterwards &s;hews him the Note or Schedule of all the other Pieces, and commanding him to open his Che&s;ts, the Jewels were there found, which that unhappy man, convinc'd of his Guilt, and trembling for Fear, deliver'd up into the hands of the Grand Seignor. The Pilgrim was call'd, who pre&s;ently knew his Bag and his Jewels; and the Doctor by an open Confe&s;&s;ion, acknow|ledg'd his Crime, and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The next day, the Emperour order'd the <HI>Divan</HI> to be A&s;&s;embled, at which he commanded that all the Grandees about <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent, to render the Judgement the more &s;olemn. He fir&s;t commanded, that whatever belong'd to the Pilgrim &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to him, together with &s;ome additional recom|pence:
<PB N="32" REF="290">
and his next command was, That the Doctor &s;hould be puni&s;h'd, accor|ding to his own Sentence. To that end, order was given, that a Stone &s;hould be made hollow, after the form of a Mortar, into which he was thrown &s;tark naked, and pounded alive by the common Executioners. And that is the &s;ame Stone-Mortar which I have often &s;een near the Gate of the <HI>Divan,</HI> and is left there for a Memorial of &s;o admirable and &s;o &s;olemn a Judgment. And this was the period of a Hi&s;tory, whereof all the circum&s;tances are remarkable, and which is not one of the lea&s;t Monuments of the Wi&s;dom of the Emperour <HI>Amurat.</HI> That Prince, in&s;tead of u&s;ing his ab&s;olute power at the fir&s;t overture of &s;uch an Affair, thought it fitter, by a per&s;picacity of mind and prudence, patiently to expect remote occa&s;ions, that he might thence deduce evident proofs of a conceal'd Crime: and his intention was to rai&s;e the Doctor to great dignities, if he had found him innocent; and to puni&s;h him &s;everely, as he did, upon the di&s;covery of his guilt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At What time, how, the Grand Seignor rids out of the way, tho&s;e, whom he &s;u&s;pects.</NOTE> I told you at the beginning of this Chapter, that of the four days of the Week, appointed for the &s;itting of the <HI>Divan,</HI> tho&s;e which are an&s;werable to our Sun|day and Tue&s;day, are the principal, as being tho&s;e on which the Affairs of greate&s;t importance are debated.

If any one of tho&s;e Nine Judges have ought to &s;ay to him, he is permitted on tho&s;e days, to &s;peak to him freely: and it is ordi|narily upon tho&s;e days al&s;o, that the Grand Seignor takes his time, if he has a mind to take off any one. He then orders the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi</HI> to be ready, with &s;ome of tho&s;e who attend him, to execute his will; and having declar'd to him who they are, whom he would have &s;trangled, the order is no &s;ooner given, but that either at their arrival, or at their departure, it is punctually obey'd. True it is, that he does not demean him&s;elf &s;o, but when he is afraid of &s;ome popular &s;edition, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;end to puni&s;h them in their own Hou&s;es, where they might make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. But within the Seraglio, and in &s;ight of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are in their &s;tations near the <HI>Divan,</HI> the unfortunate Per&s;on, whom they would have to be &s;trangled, has no more to do than to bow down his Head, and to &s;tretch out his Neck, without thinking of any re&s;i&s;tance, which would be to no purpo&s;e. In the Eleventh Chapter I &s;hall give an Account at large, how they proceed to that Execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The days on which Amba&s;|&s;adors come to the <HI>Divan.</HI></NOTE> A little beyond the Hall of the <HI>Divan,</HI> you come to another Hall, rais'd up after the manner of a Balcony, where the Amba&s;&s;adors are &s;eated, when they a&s;&s;i&s;t at the <HI>Divan,</HI> and that they do, once in three months, and upon the days that the <HI>Janizaries</HI> receive their Pay.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the inner part of the Seraglio in general, and par|ticularly, of the <HI>Quarter</HI> of the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> and the <HI>Ichoglans.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The <HI>Ichoglans</HI> Educated under a &s;evere Di&s;cipline. The great Officers of the Port taken out of the &s;ame School.

<P>THE inner Seraglio is that part of the great Palace of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours, which, from the Second Court, whereof we have given a de&s;cription, ex|tends to the point, at which place the Gardens are terminated, and which comprehends in general, the Grand Seignors Quarter, and the Quarter of the Sulta|ne&s;&s;es. But in regard the former is di&s;tingui&s;h'd into &s;everal Appartments, appointed for the Habitations of the Officers, who ordinarily approach the Grand Seignor's Per&s;on, and are his mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary attendants, I will conduct the Reader from one to another, and give a di&s;tinct relation of every one of them. In this Chapter, I &s;hall treat only of tho&s;e Appartments which are taken up by the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> and the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> who are under their Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ichoglans</HI> kept under a &s;e|vere di&s;cipline.</NOTE> At the begining of this di&s;cour&s;e, I made mention of the four principal <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> who have others &s;ub&s;titute to them, to ob&s;erve the actions of tho&s;e young Lads, who are committed to their charge, and to in&s;truct them, as well in the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, as in the Exerci&s;es of the Body, and particularly, as to what relates to the Grand Seignor's Service. The Quarter as well of the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> as the <HI>Ichoglans</HI> &s;tands next to the <HI>Divan</HI>-Hall, and begins to make part of the third Court, all along which it reaches on the left hand. It is divided into &s;everal Appartments, and among others, there are four, which they call <HI>Oda's,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Chambers, into which are di&s;tributed &s;ix hundred <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> according to the orders of the <HI>Capi-Aga;</HI> who, with the other principal <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> judges of every ones capacity. 'Tis the <HI>Capi-Aga</HI> al&s;o, who orders their pa&s;&s;ing out of one <HI>Oda</HI> into another, as we remove our Scholars from a &s;ixth form to a fifth; and the ca&s;e is the &s;ame in their <HI>Oda's</HI> as in our Forms, or Cla&s;&s;es, this fir&s;t of the four <HI>Oda's,</HI> the &s;everities whereof they mu&s;t weather out as well as they can, being the la&s;t in point of dignity. When he makes his general Vi&s;itation, upon which follows the fore&s;aid promotion, he turns out of the Seraglio, all tho&s;e whom he thinks uncapable of doing their Prince good Service, and that &s;uch as betray their di&s;gu&s;t of &s;o au&s;tere a life; and then they are put out of all hopes of ever entring into the Seraglio any more, and cannot pre|tend to any other Fortune, then that of <HI>Spahis,</HI> with a &s;mall pay. The advantages of capacitating them&s;elves for the mo&s;t eminent Charges of the Court and the Empire, makes tho&s;e who remain behind to take the greater courage, and accordingly they patiently &s;uffer, for the &s;pace of many years, the har&s;h and unmerciful treatments of the Eunuchs, whom, upon all occa&s;ions, they always find very liberal of the Ba&s;tinado.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="291">
They are tho&s;e <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> whom we may al&s;o call the Grand Seignor's Pages who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The wretched condition of the Ba&s;&s;a's Children.</NOTE>are advanc'd to the dignity of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's, Beys, Capigi-bachis, Haznadar-bachis,</HI> and the other great Officers of the Port. But they are particularly cull'd out of the number of the Tributary Children, who are taken away from the Chri&s;tians, or taken in War, by Sea or Land. For, as to the <HI>Beiczades,</HI> or Children of <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> whom they bring up in the Seraglio, you are to remember what I have already &s;aid, that they can never a&s;cend higher, than to the Charges of <HI>Beys,</HI> or Captains of Galleys.</P>
<P>When any one of the&s;e <HI>Ichoglans</HI> is de&s;irous to remove out of the Seraglio, or if any one of the white Eunuchs has the &s;ame de&s;ire, he pre&s;ents a Petition to the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who carries it to the Grand Seignor, he receives his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and is al|alow'd certain Pay, proportionabl to the continuance and quality of his Services. But there are others, whom the &s;ame <HI>Capi-Aga</HI> turns out of the Seraglio again&s;t their wills, and that after they had weather'd out the fir&s;t years, which are the mo&s;t in&s;upportable. And that is done &s;ometimes upon this &s;core, that the <HI>Capi-Aga</HI> having had &s;ome conte&s;t with any one of tho&s;e <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> while they where Camarades in the time of their youth, and fearing lea&s;t he &s;hould come one day to traver&s;e his de&s;igns, he employs all his credit and intere&s;t, to remove him out of the Seraglio, but withal procuring him a Recompence and Salary, according to the number of years he has &s;erv'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cla&s;&s;es through which the Lads brought into the Seraglio are to pa&s;s.</NOTE> The fir&s;t of the four Chambers, into which the <HI>Ichoglans</HI> are di&s;trubuted, has the greate&s;t number of them, becau&s;e they are yet very young, and as it were Novices, under the fir&s;t <HI>Perula</HI> and it is called the <HI>Couchouk-Oda,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the little Cham|ber, though it be the large&s;t of them all, in regard it is the lowe&s;t in point of Dignity. There they are taught to read and write, and are initiated in the fir&s;t grounds of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law. And after they have &s;pent &s;ix years in that Cham|ber, they are remov'd into the &s;econd, which they call <HI>Quilar-Oda,</HI> wherein being grown more robu&s;t, they are in&s;tructed in the Exerci&s;es of the Body, in &s;hooting with the Bowe, u&s;ing the Lance and other diverti&s;ements of that kind. They are more perfected in the &s;peaking of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language, whereto they al&s;o add the <HI>Arabian,</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> which they &s;hall have occa&s;ion to u&s;e, in the Governments whereto they may be &s;ent.</P>
<P>There are four years &s;pent in this &s;econd Chamber, out of which they are again removed into the third, which they call <HI>Cha&s;nadar-Oda,</HI> or the Chamber of the Trea&s;ury. In this Chamber they begin to do the Grand Seignor &s;ome Service, and to be imploy'd in the Wardrobe, and the Baths, and there they are al&s;o taught to Ride, and to perfect them&s;elves in the Exerci&s;es &s;uitable to that Station, wherein they ordinarily &s;pend four years. Each of the&s;e three forementioned Chambers has a white Eunuch for its Chief Over&s;eer. The <HI>Serai-Aga&s;i</HI> has the Direction of the fir&s;t; the <HI>Quilargi-bachi</HI> Commands in the &s;econd; and the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi</HI> is the Governour of the third.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more at large of the two la&s;t, when I come to the Chapters of the Cup-bearers Office, and the Trea&s;ury; and therefore I &s;hall only add here, concerning all the three in general, that the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> who are in&s;tructed therien, have not any Commerce with tho&s;e of the fourth Chamber, of whom I &s;hall give an account by and by, not with any other Per&s;on out of the Seraglio, or in the other Courts, but with the particular permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> and in the pre&s;ence of an Eunuch, who hears all that is &s;aid: That they cannot conver&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves but at certain regulated hours; and that conver&s;ation mu&s;t be manag'd with a great ob&s;ervance of Mode&s;ty, as there is an exact Obedience remarkable in all their deportments: And la&s;tly, that they are all clad in ordinary Cloth, even to the <HI>Beic&s;tades,</HI> that is, the Sons of <HI>Viziers</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> who are dead, while tho&s;e of the fourth Chamber wear Cloth of Gold and Silver, becau&s;e they come into the Grand Seignor's pre&s;ence, and often approach his Per&s;on. I &s;hall give you an account anon of their Dormitories, that is, the places where they take their repo&s;e, as al&s;o of the Functions of the <HI>Oda-bachi</HI> and the <HI>Deflergi-Aga,</HI> who act according to the Orders they receive from the four Eunuchs.</P>
<P>The fourth Chamber, which is the Prince's Chamber, is called <HI>Haz-Oda,</HI> and I &s;hall &s;peak of it when I come to treat of the Cup-bearers Office, and the

Grand Seignor's &s;ecret Apartment. Here, the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> who have endur'd hard|&s;hip &s;o many years in the three fir&s;t Chambers, begin to take breath, and to be allow'd more Liberty. They are permitted to conver&s;e with all Per&s;ons within the Seraglio, and they have the advantage of frequent approaches to the Prince's Per&s;on, to whom they make them&s;elves known, and from whom they ever and anon receive favours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quarters of the Four principal Eunuchs.</NOTE> Under the Gate of the third Court, where a certain number of Eunuchs are upon the Guard Night and Day, there is a pa&s;&s;age on the left hand which leads into a little Gallery, out of which there is an entrance into the Appart|meut of the <HI>Capou-Aga&s;i;</HI> and when the Gate is open, it hides that pa&s;&s;age, into which a man cannot enter but with &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>A little further, and on the right hand of the Hall of Audience, &s;tands the Appartment of the <HI>Serai-Aga&s;i,</HI> who is to take care for the keeping of the Seraglio clean and in good order; and a little further yet, near a little Mo&s;que, where the <HI>Ichoglans</HI> of the three fir&s;t Chambers go to their Devotions, lies the Quarter of the <HI>Seferlis,</HI> who are an hundred and fifty of the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> or thereabouts, par|ticularly appointed for the wa&s;hing of the Grand Seignor's Linnen. When he goes into the Countrey, the mo&s;t Antient among them are of his Retinue; and there mu&s;t be comprehended in that Number, &s;uch as play on Timbrels, and the other In&s;trumental Mu&s;icians, who have the &s;ame appointments with the re&s;t.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignor's Throne.</NOTE> This Throne, which is rich enough is in the manner of an Altar, and it is brought into that Hall only upon tho&s;e days, whereon the Grand Seignor is willing to give Audience to Amba&s;&s;adors, and when the new <HI>Cham</HI> of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary,</HI> whom he has cho&s;en to govern there, comes to receive the Inve&s;titure of his Kingdom, and to take the accu&s;tomed Oath.

<P>There are in the Trea&s;ury-Chamber eight &s;everal very &s;umptuous Coverings purpo&s;ely made to cover the afore&s;aid Throne: and they are &s;o large, that they reach down to the ground on three &s;ides of it, that is to &s;ay, before, on the right hand, and on the left: for as to the back-part, it is, as I told you, fa&s;tn'd to the partition. The mo&s;t Magnificent of all tho&s;e Coverings is of a black Velvet, with an Embroydry of great Pearls, whereof &s;ome are long, and others round, and in the form of Buttons. There is another of white Velvet, &s;et out with an Embroydery of Rubies and Emeralds, mo&s;t whereof are &s;et in Beazils, or Collets, the better to keep them in. There is a third, of a Violet-colour'd Velvet, embroyder'd with Turque&s;es and Pearls. The three others, which are next in e&s;teem to the&s;e, are al&s;o of Velvets of different Colours, with a rich Embroydery of Gold. And the two la&s;t are of a Gold-Brokado, which have al&s;o their particular Beauty and &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s. The Throne is adorn'd with one fo the&s;e coverings, ac|cording to the Grand Seignor's re&s;pect to the Sovereign, who&s;e Emba&s;ly he receives; and he levels his own Magnificence to that of the Prince whom he would honour.</P>

From the very Gate of the Court, kept by the Eunuchs, quite to that of the Hall, they walk all along upon Car|pets of Silk; and the Floor of the Hall, though all paved with Marble, is al&s;o covered with another Carpet of Gold, the Workman&s;hip whereof &s;omewhat re|&s;embles that of our ordinary Straw-Mats, and much about the &s;ame thickne&s;s.</P>

<P>The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;tian Princes and States who ordinarily re&s;ide at the Port, are the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Re&s;ident of the States General, who have all their re&s;pective Habitations in <HI>Pera.</HI> When there comes thither any Amba&s;&s;ador or Re&s;ident, from the Emperor, or from <HI>Poland,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> they oblige them to take up their abodes at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that they may be the more a&s;&s;ur'd of their per&s;ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the number of Ve&s;ts, which the Grand Seignor orders to be gi|ven the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;tian Princes&punc;</NOTE> The Grand Seignor di&s;tingui&s;hes the Quality of tho&s;e Princes and States, and the e&s;teem he has for them, by the number of Ve&s;ts which he orders to be be&s;tow'd on their Amba&s;&s;adors when they come to Audience. The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> has four and twenty allowed him; the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ixteen; the Amba&s;&s;ador or Agent of <HI>Venice</HI> receives twelve, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador as many.</P>
<P>When Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Marcheville</HI> was Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Turkey,</HI> from his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty of <HI>France,</HI> I had the honour to be one of tho&s;e who accompanyed him to the Seraglio, where after Dinner with the <HI>Vizirs,</HI> in the <HI>Divan</HI>-Hall, while his Retinue were treated under the Gallery, the Ve&s;ts were brought according to the cu&s;tome. The Amba&s;&s;ador coming to di&s;trubute them to tho&s;e whom he had a mind to favour, and take along with him to the Audience, he was much &s;urprized, to find that he had got but &s;ixteen. He imme|diately &s;ent word to the Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> that he wanted eight Ve&s;ts, and that he would not go to his Audience, till he had the full number, which they had wont to pre&s;ent to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France.</HI> There was &s;ome conte&s;t about it, which retarded the Audience near an hours time; but at la&s;t Moun&s;ieur <HI>de Marcheville</HI> per&s;i&s;ting in his re&s;olution, the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> complyed, and &s;ent him eight other Ve&s;ts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form of the Oath of Allegiance made by the <HI>Cham</HI> of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary</HI> to the Grand Seignor.</NOTE> What remains of this Chapter mu&s;t repre&s;ent the manner, how the <HI>Cham</HI> of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary</HI> comes into this Hall of Audience to take the Oath of Allegiance to the Grand Seignor. The Reader will be plea&s;ed to remember, what Ob&s;ervation I made at the beginning of this Work concerning the Family of that Tributary Prince, whom the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperors keep under the Yoke. The <HI>Cham</HI> who is to Reign in his turn, and according to what di&s;po&s;al the Grand Seignor has made of the Government, pre|&s;ents him&s;elf before him in the Hall of Audience, and after he has ki&s;&s;ed his Robe, re|tires &s;ome paces back, and &s;tands. Then they bring in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> upon a great green Velvet Cu&s;hion, without any Embroydery, at the four Corners whereof there are four Ta&s;&s;els of Gold and Silk, and they place it on the Grand Seignors right hand. Now whereas he &s;its on a Carpet cro&s;s-leggd, there mu&s;t be great care taken, that the Cu&s;hion be not &s;o high as his knees; for the <HI>Turks</HI> would account that a great &s;in; and they bear &s;ogreat a re&s;pect to the Book of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that they cannot touch it till they have fir&s;t wa&s;h'd them&s;elves. Before they open it, they ki&s;s it, and put it upon their heads, and after they have read &s;omething in it, they ki&s;s the writing of it, and then they rub their faces with it, before they &s;hut it. The Prince, who is to take his Oath, is &s;tanding all this time, as I told you, with his hands &s;tretch'd out one again&s;t the other, and lifted up as high as his &s;houlders, to receive the Book of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> out of tho&s;e of the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who had been to take it off the Cu&s;hion, having ki&s;s'd it and touch'd his head with it.</P>

<P>THE Baths de&s;ign'd for the Grand Seignor's own Per&s;on, and his principal Officers, take up a great &s;pace of the Quarter of the Eunuchs. The little Ovens, whereby they are heated, called <HI>Kulkans,</HI> are adjoyning to the Appartment of the <HI>Serai-houda&s;i,</HI> and fifteen <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> the mo&s;t robu&s;t that can be found, are imploy'd in keeping the Fire going. They have the deno|mination of <HI>Kulkangis;</HI> and five and twenty others, who are named <HI>Dellaks,</HI> are employ'd in the Baths, to &s;have and rub the Body, as al&s;o in applying Cupping-Gla&s;&s;es to tho&s;e who &s;tand in need thereof. Among the <HI>Kulkangis,</HI> he who is the mo&s;t antient in that Employment has a pre-eminence and &s;uperiority over the re&s;t, whom he many times commands to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in wre&s;tling, and lifting a heavy Iron Bar with one hand.</P>
<P>There are three &s;uch Bars fa&s;ten'd upon great Cramp-Irons over the door that goes into the Baths, and the middlemo&s;t of the three, as it is common|ly reported, weighs a hundred <HI>Okkas,</HI> which amount to Three hundred and fifty pounds <HI>Paris</HI> weight, an <HI>Okka</HI> weighing three pounds and a half, or thereabouts. There was heretofore one of tho&s;e <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> of &s;o prodigious <NOTE PLACE="marg">The prodigious &s;trength of Body of a certain <HI>Ichoglan.</HI></NOTE>&s;trength, that the Grand Seignor him&s;elf would have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing a Tryal whether he could with one hand lift up and turn about that Iron-bar; which he did to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the Prince, and pre&s;ently after he entertain'd him with another demon&s;tration of the &s;trength of his Arm. Over the&s;e three Iron-bars, there hung two Head-pieces of Iron whereof one was an inch in thickne&s;s, and the other about the eight part of an inch. The &s;ame <HI>Ichoglan</HI> did, in the Grand Seignor's pre&s;ence, at one blow of a Battle-Axe,
<PB N="40" REF="294">
cut through the head-piece of an inch thick, and, at one blow with a Sabre&punc; cleft the other to the middle of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mo&s;quey belonging to the Appartment of the Eunuchs.</NOTE> Oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e Ovens are the Cocks, whereby the waters are di&s;tributed into the &s;everal Rooms of the Baths; and I forgot to tell you, That before you enter into that place, you find a little Mo&s;quey, adjoyning to the Appartment of the <HI>Saraiket|houda&s;i,</HI> where all the <HI>Ichoglans</HI> go to their devotions twice a day. If they fail the doing of it, the <HI>Oda-bachi,</HI> who, in every Chamber, takes notice of their demean|ours, calls them to an account, and they are &s;ure of the ba&s;tinado, as they are al&s;o for any other fault they commit; and &s;ometimes they receive the &s;aid pui&s;h|ment on the &s;oles of their feet, and, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions to &s;uch a number of blowes, that the nails of their toes come off; and that is the puni&s;hent which is properly call'd <HI>Drubbing.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Employ|ment of the Dwarfs and Mutes.</NOTE> Out of that Mo&s;quey you pa&s;s into a Gallery, adjoyning to the Baths, and there the <HI>Di&s;lis</HI> and the <HI>Geuges;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Mutes and the Dwarfs are employ'd in &s;ome work or other all day long. Some &s;pend the time in learning to make up Turbants, wherein there is more work and difficulty than is imagin'd, e&s;pecially in making up the Grand Seignior's own Turbant, when he goes to the <HI>Divan.</HI> For then he takes an extraordinary large one, as do al&s;o all the Officers of the &s;ame <HI>Divan</HI> when they go to Council: and I cannot make a better repre|&s;entation of that kind of Turbant, then by the form of our large&s;t &s;ort of Citrals, if they be made hollow in the middle, &s;o as that the head might enter into that hole.</P>
<P>Others are employ'd in &s;having, paring the nails, and other things of that kind. They do not make u&s;e of any Scizars for the nails, in <HI>Turkey</HI> nor in any part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> it being a thing forbidden by <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his Law, and accordingly they account the doing of it a great &s;in. But they make u&s;e of a little Steel In&s;trument, &s;omewhat like a Pen-knife, and the only cutting part is the end of it, and they are dextrous enough in the performance of that Office. It is the Cu&s;tom all over the Ea&s;t, that the Barber who trims you, &s;hould al&s;o make up your Tur|band, which is many times di&s;compos'd, pair the Nails of your Hands and Toes, and take away the filth out of your Ears: for the <HI>Turks</HI> and all the Inhabitants of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> are great lovers of cleanline&s;s, and cannot endure the lea&s;t na&s;tine&s;s, either on them&s;elves, or tho&s;e who come near them, as I &s;hall give you an account anon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colours forbid|den the Chri&s;ti|ans in their Coiffure.</NOTE> And having &s;poken &s;o much of the Turbant, it will not be un&s;ea&s;onable for me to communicate this Remark to you here, That in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and all over <HI>Arabia,</HI> none but <HI>Mahumetans</HI> are permitted to make u&s;e of White for the covering of their Heads; whereas in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and all over the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Empire, men may take what Colours they plea&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;cription of the Baths.</NOTE> I come now to the great Bath, which is adjoyning to the Chamber of the <HI>Ha|mangi-bachi,</HI> who is the chief Over&s;eer of it, and which makes part of the Appart|ment of the <HI>Seferlis,</HI> or the Grand Seignor's Laundry-men. The place where they put off their Cloaths, is a &s;pacious Louver or Banquetting-Hou&s;e of Free-&s;tone, high enough, and in one of the mo&s;t eminent parts of the Seraglio. The Floor is paved with a very delightful kind of Marble laid in &s;quare pieces; and it has two large Windows jutting out upon the Gardens, &s;omewhat like Balconies, from which you have a Pro&s;pect of the two Seas. In the mid&s;t of that <HI>Domo</HI> or <HI>Louver,</HI> yon find a Fountain, the Water whereof is received into two Ba&s;ins or Ci&s;terns: The former, which is the highe&s;t, and withal the lea&s;t, is of one piece of White Marble, having in it a little intermixture of Red and Black Veins, and pierced through at &s;ix &s;everal places, for the reception of &s;o many &s;mall Pipes of Copper through which the Water falls down into the other Ba&s;in, which is al&s;o of Marble, of &s;evreal Pieces, and &s;everal Colours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abu&s;es re|&s;crm'd</NOTE> Within the Domo, there is a great number of Poles, which are di&s;po&s;ed all about it, and &s;upported by certain pieces of Iron coming out of the Wall. Upon tho&s;e Poles they dry the Linnen which they had u&s;ed in the Bath; and of that Linnen there are &s;everal &s;orts. Heretofore, the Pages were allowed only a long Piece of Linnen Cloth, which came only twice about their wa&s;tes: but upon ob&s;ervation made, that they abu&s;ed them, and that hand&s;ome young Lads playing together, &s;natched that piece of Linnen one from the other, purpo&s;ely to di&s;cover
<PB N="41" REF="294">
their nakedne&s;s, they u&s;e in the Baths only &s;uch Garments of Linnen as are &s;owed clo&s;e above, and reach from the wa&s;te down to the Feet, much after the manner of a Womans Petti-coat. At their coming out of the Bath, they have two other &s;orts of Linnen to dry them&s;elves withal, of the largene&s;s of ordinary Table-Cloths, whereof the one is Red, with a border of Silk of three fingers breadth, which covers them, as &s;oon as they are out of the water, from the wa&s;te downwards to the ham; and the other is White, wherewith they rub them&s;elves. For the&s;e two &s;orts of Towels&punc; they have but one Name, to wit, <HI>Pechetamal.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Le|vantines</HI> do not u&s;e Paper un|decently.</NOTE> On one &s;ide of the Fountain, which is in the mid&s;t of the Domo, there is an entrance into the Bath, and near that is the Hall where they uncloath them|&s;elves in the Winter-time. A little Gallery which lies on the left hand, leads to the places de&s;ign'd for the ea&s;ing of nature, and every &s;eat has a little Cock, which &s;upplies them with water to wa&s;h them&s;elves, after they have done. It is accounted an heinous Sin among them, to make u&s;e of Paper for that purpo&s;e; and the rea&s;on they give for it is this, That, po&s;&s;ibly, the Name of God might be written upon it&punc; or might contain &s;ome Text of the Law, which would be a profanation of it, and con&s;equently ought to be avoided. Be&s;ides, they have another opinion, That Paper is not &s;o proper &s;o well to make clean that part, which the nece&s;&s;ity of the Body does ordinarily &s;o much defile, but that there may be &s;omething of ordure left; and that being obliged to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before God with an ab&s;olute Purity of Body and Mind, their Prayers could not be heard, if they &s;hould not be wholly clean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> more &s;crupulous than the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are yet more &s;crupulous than the <HI>Turks</HI> upon this account. For though they both agree in this, That their Devotions are ineffectual, nay in|deed that they are not in a condition to perform them without crime, if they be not pure, as to Body and Mind; Yet the former are of a per&s;wa&s;ion, That the lea&s;t ordure which, through Negligence or Inadvertency, might remain upon their Per&s;ons or their Garments, would render their Prayers fruitle&s;s and criminal, which the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;uper&s;titious as to that particular, will not acknowledge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are great lovers of clean|line&s;s.</NOTE> Certain it is al&s;o, That in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they are extraordinary Lovers of Cleanline&s;s; in&s;omuch that I have ob&s;erved, That at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the Metropolis of that Country, where the Streets are not paved, when there falls a little Snow or Rain, which mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;ome dirt, few People will come out of their Hou&s;es, unle&s;s they be forced thereto by &s;ome Concern of great importance. And when they do go abroad at &s;uch a time, at the Hou&s;e-door into which they are to enter, they put off their Shooes, their Upper-garment, the Cap which covers their Turbauts; and if they have the lea&s;t dirt or filth about them, they think them&s;elves im|pure, and that it would be a di&s;re&s;pect to the Per&s;on whom they are to Vi&s;it. Nay, a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;hall be very &s;crupulous, and make a great difficulty to receive a Man into his Hou&s;e in Foul Weather; and if any one pre&s;ents him&s;elf into that plea&s;ure, he makes a &s;ign to him with his hand to keep at a certain di&s;tance from him, in the place wherein he is to enter into Di&s;cour&s;e with him. For if by chance as he comes out of the Street, where there is &s;ome dirt, and where Hor&s;es pa&s;s to and fro, and may ca&s;t &s;ome of it upon him, he has the lea&s;t &s;pot of any daggling about him, and afterwards touch the Per&s;on whom he comes to Vi&s;it, this latter would be <HI>Nagis,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Unclean,</HI> and thereupon be obliged immediately to change his Cloaths; &s;o great is the Super|&s;tition of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as to that particular.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chambers very divertive and Commo|dious,</NOTE> At the end of the Gallery, there is a door which gives you pa&s;&s;age into three Chambers, which are &s;o many Baths for the u&s;e of the Grand Seignor's Quarter. There is adjoyning to the la&s;t of tho&s;e Chambers a &s;pacious place pav'd Chequer|wi&s;e with Marble of different colours, and there the <HI>Ichoglans</HI> are trimm'd. This place has a little eminency in the mid&s;t of it, from which there is a gentle de&s;cent of all &s;ides, that the Water wherewith the Barbars wa&s;h their Heads and Beards may the more ea&s;ily be carried off, and the place be always kept clean. On both &s;ides of the Wall, whereby it is enclos'd, there is a great double Cock, with two Keys belonging to it, which, at the &s;ame mouth, &s;upplyes them alternately with either hot water, or cold, and that falls into a Ba&s;in or Receptacle of White
<PB N="42" REF="295">
Marble, wherein three or four men may bathe them&s;elves without any incon|venience, or trouble one to the other. There is al&s;o at one of the ends a little Room of Black and White Marble, and there the Barbers, who have no knowledge of any other Profe&s;&s;ion, put up all their nece&s;&s;ary Uten&s;ils and In&s;tru|ments, as Razors, Hones, Balls, and tho&s;e Irons wherewith they pare their Nails: for as for Linnen, they do not u&s;e any; and tho&s;e who are to be &s;hav'd come in &s;tark naked from the Wa&s;te upwards, and are cover'd from thence downwards, only with a Cloath, which reaches to the Ancle. 'Tis a great Rarity to meet with any one among tho&s;e Barbers that knowes how to let blood, and their Lancets, are much like the Fleams, wherewith our Farriers bleed Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the Chamber of the Barbers, there are three other Rooms arch'd with Marble, the large&s;t whereof much &s;urpa&s;&s;es in Beauty tho&s;e that are adjoyning to it. The Floor of it is of white and black Marble, and the Walls are done about with &s;quare pieces, that are white and blew, and in every one of them you find a Flower in embo&s;s'd Work, done to the Life, and which a man would take for enamell. Little Lamines or Plates of Gold cover the junctures of tho&s;e &s;quare pieces, and there cannot any thing be imagin'd more plea&s;ant and divertive than that Chamber is. In the Roof of it, there are &s;everal round holes, of about half a foot diameter, over which there are little Gla&s;&s;es made in the fa&s;hion of Bells, order'd as the Venice-Looking-Gla&s;&s;es are, le&s;t any one &s;hould have the curio&s;ity, to get up to the Roof, and laying him&s;elf upon his belly think to &s;ee what is done in the Bath. The place has no light but what it receives by the means of tho&s;e holes, and while &s;ome body is in the Bath: But e&s;pecially when they go out of it, the door is &s;hut, the better to keep in the heat, and to prevent their being &s;een; which might be if in&s;tead of tho&s;e forementioned holes in the Roof, there were Windows below, according to our Mode. All the other Baths have their Structures after the &s;ame manner, and having no light but what comes at little glaz'd holes, there is not any pa&s;&s;age into it but that of the door, to the end that being pre&s;ently &s;hut, the heat might the better be kept within the Bath, and to prevent their being &s;een who are in it.</P>
<P>The Second Chamber is another Bath, but as to Beauty, it is much inferiour to the other; And as for the third, there is &s;omething in it which is &s;ingularly re|markable. The Floor of it is lay'd as with a &s;ort of &s;mall &s;tones, &s;o as that the foot cannot &s;lip, though it be wetted at their departure out of the Bath: And the whole Room is done all about with &s;quare pieces, having in them flowers of embo&s;s'd work, done to the Life and covered with Gold and Azure. This is the place into which the Grand Seignor enters, when he comes out of the Bath; and he always goes into it alone, when he intends to &s;have him&s;elf in tho&s;e parts, which are not to be nam'd without immode&s;ty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet's</HI> Prohibition to be &s;een naked.</NOTE> <HI>Mahomet</HI> pronounces a Cur&s;e upon tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;een, and upon all tho&s;e who look on them: And the &s;trict ob&s;ervance, of his Law re|quires, That both Men and Women ought to &s;have them&s;elves, without u&s;ing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Earth that takes off hair, and its dange|rous effects.</NOTE> But mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of the EASTERN Parts, the <HI>Arabians, Tartars,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> make u&s;e of a more ea&s;ie expedient then the Razor, to get off hair. It is a certain Earth, which they mix with &s;ome Orpiment, or Ar&s;enick, and which becomes &s;oft as butter. When they are in the Bath, and begin to &s;weat, they take of that Earth and therewith rub the parts, from which they would have the hair to fall, and pre&s;ently after they mu&s;t be very carefull to &s;ee, whether it begins to fall, as one would ob&s;erve a Fowl, who&s;e feathers he would take off, after it had been ca&s;t into &s;calding water. For if that Earth be left too long upon the parts whereto it had been apply'd, it burns and makes holes in the fle&s;h, the marks whereof will remain, &s;omewhat re&s;embling tho&s;e, which the Small Pox &s;ometimes leaves behind it. Be&s;ides the skin of tho&s;e parts, whereto this application is made, becomes in time as hard and rough as Leather; and tho&s;e ungrateful inconveniencies have diverted the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> from u&s;ing that Expedient.

<P>THE Trea&s;ury of the Seraglio and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, the va&s;t Wealth therein contain'd, and the excellent order wherewith it is govern'd, re|quir'd my being a little more large upon that &s;ubject. I &s;hall di&s;cover all the Rivers which fall into that Sea, and may have &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e that enter into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and are never &s;een to come out of it again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Noble Relicks of Antiquity.</NOTE> Out of the Chamber, where the Grand Seignor &s;haves him&s;elf, you pa&s;s into a Gallery, which is Thirty Paces in length, and between Nine and Ten in breadth. There are on the one &s;ide of it, Six great Marble-Pillars, of Fifteen Foot in height, and of different colours, among which there is one of a very delightful Green, and that colour makes the <HI>Turks</HI> have a great e&s;teem for it. You have under your feet in this Gallery a Walk of large &s;quare Pieces of Marble, and the high-rais'd Fret-work thereof is a Relick of Antiquity, and there are in it excellent Pieces of Painting after the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> way, repre&s;enting divers Per&s;ons,
<PB N="44" REF="296">
and which &s;ome conceive to have been made for the reception and entertain|ment of &s;ome great Prince, in the time of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> have an aver&s;ion for Figures repre|&s;enting Man or Bea&s;t.</NOTE> The <HI>Turks,</HI> who have not among them either Gravers or Painters, in order to the making of any repre&s;entation of Man or Bea&s;t, for which they have an aver|&s;ion, have thought it much to endure tho&s;e Figures, and not being able to refrain from di&s;figuring the heads, there is nothing left but the bodies, which is much to be regretted. It may ea&s;ily be conjectur'd, that the Gallery was open on both &s;ides, as being &s;o &s;till to the Court-&s;ide, and 'tis in the mid&s;t of the Wall, whereby it is enclos'd on the other &s;ide, that the Door of the Trea&s;ury &s;tands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chambers of the Trea&s;ury, and their Wealth.</NOTE> The fir&s;t Trea&s;ury con&s;i&s;ts in Four Chambers full of Riches and Rarities. The fir&s;t contains a va&s;t quantity of Long-Bows, Arrows, Cro&s;s-bows, Muskets, Fire|locks, Sabres, Cymitars, and other Arms of that kind, which are all &s;o many Ma&s;ter-Pieces, that have been pre&s;ented, from time to time, to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Em|perours. All the&s;e Arms are either hung up at the Ceeling, or fa&s;ten'd again&s;t the Wall; but in a pitiful condition, all over-run with ru&s;t, and cover'd with du&s;t; and the Grand Seignor &s;uffers them to be &s;o neglected, becau&s;e there come in daily Pre&s;ents of Arms excellently wrought, the novelty whereof makes him forget the old ones; as al&s;o for that it is the humour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> not to make any great account of Curio&s;ities, but at the very time they are pre&s;ented with them.</P>
<P>The Second Chamber is a very &s;pacious Arched Structure, of the &s;ame height and Architecture as that of the Bath, of which I gave you an account in the pre|cedent Chapter, where they go and uncloath them&s;elves in the Summer time: And there is no difference between them, &s;ave only that this la&s;t has no over|tures in the Roof. That place contains Six great Che&s;ts, or Coffers, each of them of Twelve Foot in length, Six in breadth, and Six in depth; and if the Covers were not broken to pieces, two men would find it a hard matter to lift them, they are &s;o weighty. The&s;e Coffers, which are called <HI>Ambars,</HI> are full of all &s;orts of Cloaths for the Grand Seignor's u&s;e, as Ve&s;ts, rich Furs, Magnificent Turbants, and Cu&s;hions embroider'd with Pearls.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Six Coffers before mentioned, there are Eight others, which are but Eight Foot in length, and four in breadth; and the&s;e are fill'd with Pieces of Scarlet, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Cloaths, of the fine&s;t &s;orts, Pieces of Velvet, Gold and Silver Brokadoes, Embroider'd Coverlets and Counterpanes for Beds, and other rich Commodities of that Nature. As for the Bridles and Saddles cover'd with precious Stones, they are di&s;pos'd upon &s;upporters of Wood or Iron, coming out of the Wall: and all this Chamber is generally very well kept, and all things are neat, and in good order.</P>
<P>The Third Chamber is very &s;pacious, and is more like a great Hall. The fir&s;t thing that entertains your Eye, is a great Coffer, the in&s;ide whereof is di|vided into three parts, and makes as it were Three other Coffers, one upon the other: but they are open'd all on the out-&s;ide, &s;o as that if there be any thing look'd for in the undermo&s;t, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tirring the uppermo&s;t. The lowermo&s;t Coffer contains tho&s;e &s;umptuous Coverings for the Grand Seignor's Throne, of which I have &s;poken in the De&s;cription of the Hall of Audience. In the middlemo&s;t are di&s;pos'd the Hou&s;&s;es and Trappings, enrich'd with Embroi|dery, and &s;ome of them with Pearls and precious Stones, which are u&s;ed in great Solemnities. In the uppermo&s;t Coffer, are kept the Bridles, Brea&s;t-Pieces, Crup|pers, and Stirrups, which are recommendable upon the &s;core of the Diamonds, Rubies Emeralds, and other Precious Stones, whereby they are enrich'd: but the greate&s;t part of them is cover'd with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>-Stones, which they have the art of &s;etting ex|cellently well.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Blood of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> one of the Rivers that fall into the Sea of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> It is a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ight, to behold the quantity of tho&s;e precious Harne&s;&s;es: but it is &s;uch only to tho&s;e, who are ignorant, how the Grand Seignor repleni&s;hes his Trea&s;ury with &s;o much Wealth. It happens thus, That there being a frequent mortality among&s;t the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> and others, who are Governours, of Provinces, whether it be by a natural death, or a violent, and all they have in the World falling to the Grand Seignor, as I told you el&s;ewhere, and being brought into the Seraglio, there are ordinarily found, among&s;t their rich Harne&s;&s;es, &s;ome Bridles cover'd with pretious Stones, and tho&s;e Bridles are brought into the Trea&s;ury.
<PB N="45" REF="296">
The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the Gold and Silver ready coyn'd, and all the Jewels, and whatever el&s;e tho&s;e Ba&s;&s;a's were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. But as to their Saddles, which ordinarily are cover'd with Plates of Gold of the thickne&s;s of a <HI>Ducat,</HI> they are put into the hands of the <HI>Imbrohor-bachi,</HI> who is the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and come not with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Seraglio.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides, in the very &s;ame Chamber, &s;everal other Coffers of different Bulks, wherein there is contain'd abundance of mo&s;t precious things. Some of them are full of rich Swords, adorn'd with precious Stones, as al&s;o of Sabres which have the &s;ame Ornaments. For the <HI>Turks</HI> when they are on Hor&s;e-back, make u&s;e of both Sabres and Swords, of a good length, and &s;omewhat broader than ours. They wear the Sabre on one &s;ide, and fa&s;ten the Sword all along the Saddle, as they al&s;o do the Battle-Axe, yet &s;o as that this la&s;t pa&s;&s;es under their Thighs, which cannot incommode them much, becau&s;e when they are mounted, they ride with very &s;hort Stirrups. The Sides, and the Handles of the Battle-Axes which they carry in Triumph, are al&s;o covered with precious Stones; and in all their Accoutrements the <HI>Turks</HI> are Magnificent, and do not &s;pare for Money. When the Grand Seignor de&s;igns to honour a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> he &s;ends him one of tho&s;e Swords, or one of tho&s;e Sabres, with a Ve&s;t of Gold-Brockado, lin'd with &s;ome rich Fur. But the&s;e &s;umptuous Pieces do but pa&s;s to and fro, in as much as that upon the Death of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> who&s;e E&s;tates fall to the Grand Seignor, and con&s;equently are brought into the Seraglio, they are &s;till found again in the Trea|&s;ury, as in their Center.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The u&s;e of Aloes Wood u&s;ed in <HI>Turkey.</HI></NOTE> There are yet other Coffers fill'd with <HI>Amber-geeece, Musk&punc;</HI> the precious Wood call'd <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> and <HI>Sandal-wood.</HI> There is a certain &s;ort of this <HI>Lignum-Aloes,</HI> which is worth a thou&s;and Crowns the Pound, according as it is Fat, or Oily, the mo&s;t Oily being always the be&s;t, and the <HI>Turks</HI> are very expen&s;ive in this <HI>Aloes</HI> Wood. When &s;ome Per&s;ons come to vi&s;it them, and a&s;&s;oon as they are &s;ate down, it is their cu&s;tom to pre&s;ent them with a Pipe of Tobacco, with &s;ome <HI>Lignum Aloes</HI> in it, which is done after this manner. They take of that Wood, according to the Oyline&s;s of it, and con&s;equently its making a greater fumigation, the quantity of a Pea, or a &s;mall Bean, and after they have moi&s;ten'd it a little they put it over a few Coals in a Chafing-di&s;h, in a kind of Perfuming-Pot, which they pre&s;ent one after another, to all the Company. There comes out a thick Steam or Exhalation&punc; wherewith every one Perfumes his Head and his Beard, and &s;ometimes the in-&s;ide of his Turbant, after which he lifts up his hands on high, crying <HI>Elmendela,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Thanks be to God.</HI> But before they pre&s;ent them with the Perfuming-pot, there is &s;ome Ro&s;e-water brought in a Ve&s;&s;el of Gold, or Silver, according to the Quality of tho&s;e who make the Vi&s;it. This Ve&s;|&s;el is commonly a foot in height, the lower part of it being about the bigne&s;s of a mans fi&s;t, and from thence growing gradually &s;maller and &s;maller to the top of it, which is about the bigne&s;s of ones little finger. At the top of it there is a little hole, out of which comes the Ro&s;e-water, wherewith they wa&s;h their hands and faces, and then hold them over the &s;uffumigation of the <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> which not only dries up the water, but al&s;o &s;ticks &s;o much the clo&s;er to the hair of the Head and Beard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ba&s;ins of a more commodious fa&s;hion than ours.</NOTE> There are al&s;o in tho&s;e Coffers abundance of Aromatical Simples, and precious Drugs, <HI>Bezoar</HI>-Stones, and &s;tore of <HI>Ma&s;tick,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> and the young Maids of the Seraglio pa&s;s away their time. They have of it perpetually in their Mouths&punc; and this <HI>Ma&s;tick</HI> &s;weetens the Breath, and clean&s;es the Teeth, upon which &s;core they are the better belov'd.</P>
<P>There may be &s;een al&s;o in the &s;ame Chamber, and in other Coffers, abundance of Plate, both Gold and Silver, which is never us'd, the Grand Seignor having other pieces, for his ordinary u&s;e, in the <HI>Kilar,</HI> whatever is &s;erv'd up to his own Table being altogether in Pourcelain.</P>
<P>There are, among&s;t other Pieces, &s;everal Ba&s;ins and Ewers, whereof &s;ome are enrich'd with &s;everal &s;orts of precious Stones. Tho&s;e Ba&s;ins are of a fa&s;hion more commodious than that of ours, and it is an evident Mark of the cleanline&s;s of the <HI>Levantines.</HI> They are found, and about half a foot in depth, and cover'd as it were with a Plate or Server&punc; full of little holes, which makes the concavity of it of equal height with the &s;ides, and &s;o hides the dirtine&s;s of the water which lies at the bottom of it. They do not ri&s;e after their refection, in <HI>Turkey,</HI> till they
<PB N="46" REF="297">
have wa&s;h'd their Mouths and their Hands, to do which they bring you Soap and warm Water; and among&s;t Per&s;ons of Quality, they pre&s;ent Ro&s;e|water or &s;ome other &s;weet Water, into which you put the corner of your Hand|kercher.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tapers of a kind of Wax of great value.</NOTE> They have al&s;o in tho&s;e Coffers great Tapers, or Wax-Candles of above two foot in length, made of a certain very dear compo&s;ition, of a greyi&s;h colour, which has &s;ome re&s;emblance to Wax, and is brought out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> every Taper amounting to near a hundred Crowns. They are not us'd but only when the Grand Seignor goes to vi&s;it the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> and then there are two of tho&s;e Tapers lighted, and &s;et in great golden Candle&s;ticks, enrich'd with precious Stones. When they are a little above half burnt out, the Negro-Eunuchs, who &s;erve in the <HI>Haran,</HI> light others, and, out of civility, make a Pre&s;ent of the fore-mentioned remainders to the principal Women attending on the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>There is moreover in one of tho&s;e Coffers, abundance of Clocks and Watches, <HI>German</HI>-work, as al&s;o of Knives and Ink&punc;horns, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mode, all tho&s;e pieces being the choice Productions and Ma&s;ter-pieces of great Arti&s;ts, and adorn'd with precious Stones. There is to be &s;een, in fine, all along the Walls, but cover'd with a Scarlet Stuff, &s;everal Arms, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>-Mode, neatly kept in order, as Bowes, Arrows, Targets, Battle-Axes, excellently well wrought, and mo&s;t of the&s;e Pieces are of a con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ine&s;timable Coffer of all &s;orts of precious Stones.</NOTE> But what is mo&s;t precious in that Chamber and tran&s;cends all the re&s;t is a &s;trong Coffer all of Iron-work, which contains another of about a foot and a half &s;quare, wherein there is a va&s;t Trea&s;ure. When this Coffer is open'd, you &s;ee a kind of Gold-Smiths Jewel Box, wherein are ranked all &s;orts of Jewels of highe&s;t value, as <HI>Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds,</HI> a huge number of excellent <HI>Topazes,</HI> and four of tho&s;e Gems call'd <HI>Cats-eyes,</HI> which are &s;o beautiful, that they are not to be valu'd. Having &s;atisfy'd your curio&s;ity with the former, you come next to certain little Drawers full of &s;everal Jewels, great Ro&s;es of Diamonds, Pendants, other Ro&s;es of Rubies and Emeralds, Strings and Chains of Pearls and Bracelets. There &s;tands a&s;ide by it &s;elf a Cabinet, where are the <HI>Sorgouges,</HI> or the thing wherein are fa&s;tn'd the Heron-tops, which the Grand Seignor wears in his Turbant. They are as it were little handles, made in the fa&s;hion of Tulips, cover'd over with the mo&s;t precious Stones of the Seraglio, and 'tis into this that the Heron-top enters, that rich Plume of Feathers, whereof I have el&s;ewhere given the de&s;cription. Of the&s;e Handles, &s;ome are higher and more precious than others; and my Over&s;eer of the Trea&s;ury a&s;&s;ur'd me, That, of all &s;orts of them, great and &s;mall, there are above a hundred and fifty. The le&s;&s;er ones &s;erve only for the Campagne, and the great ones, which are the riche&s;t are re&s;erv'd for the Pomps and Magnificence of the Court, and when the Grand Seignor marches in Ceremony to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> If he has a de&s;ire to &s;atisfie his &s;ight with the lu&s;ture of his precious Jewels, he Orders the Coffer to be brought into his own Chamber; but if he call for &s;ome particular Piece of the Trea&s;ury, he gives order to the <HI>Cha&s;nader-bachi,</HI> to fetch it, and that Chief Officer of the Trea&s;ury cannot enter into it, without abundance of my&s;terious precautions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">autions and Ceremonies ob&s;erv'd at the opening of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> There are alwayes Sixty Pages, more or le&s;s, belonging to the Chambers of the Trea&s;ury. The number of them is not fixt, but the Credit of the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> and the <HI>Cha&s;nader-Bachi,</HI> may augment or dimini&s;h it, according to their inclinations and intere&s;ts. Unle&s;s they fall into di&s;grace, as he had done from whom I have &s;ome part of the&s;e In&s;tructions, they never go out of the Seraglio, but upon their ad|vancement to &s;ome con&s;iderable Government, or the &s;ettlement of a hand&s;ome Pen&s;ion for their maintenance; and &s;o, provided they do nothing ami&s;s, they are well enough accommodated for their lives. The Chief Officer of the Trea&s;ury having receiv'd Orders from the Grand Seignor to bring the Piece he would have, a&s;&s;embles all the Pages in their Chamber, and &s;ends for the <HI>Anakdar-Aga&s;i,</HI> who has the Cu&s;tody of the Keyes. This la&s;t having given three &s;troaks with his hand upon the Drawer, wherein they are enclos'd, takes them out of it, and following the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-Bachi,</HI> attended by the Sixty Pages, they all make their appearance together at the door of the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="297">
The fir&s;t thing that is done is the untwi&s;ting of a Chain, which they had put there for the better &s;ecuring of the Seal, which the Chief Officer of the Trea&s;ury had &s;et over the hole, and having found it entire, he orders it to be broken by the keeper of the Keyes, and commands him to open. A&s;&s;oon as they are got into the Chamber into which the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi</HI> knows they are to go, he &s;ets him&s;elf down upon a low Bench, and declares what Piece it is that the Grand Seignor re|quires. They thereupon open the Coffer, wherein it ought to be, then they pre|&s;ent it to the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> and, if he be de&s;irous of that honour, he has the priviledge to be him&s;elf the Bearer of it to the Grand Seignor. Then has he a fair Opportunity to &s;ecure &s;omething that is precious to him&s;elf, if he has the dexterity to do it without any di&s;covery. When he is in the Trea&s;ury, he needs only &s;ay, That the Grand Seignor de&s;ires al&s;o the Piece, which he has a mind to convert to his own u&s;e, and cau&s;ing all to be immediately carried to his own Chamber, he there leaves what he would keep, and pre&s;ents to the Prince only that which he had commanded to be brought him. Not but that whatever is receiv'd into the Trea&s;ury and whatever goes out of it, is exactly &s;et down and enroll'd by the <HI>Haznaquatib,</HI> or Clerk, who keeps the Regi&s;ters; and the Cheat might be ea&s;ily di&s;|cover'd, when at the quitting of his Charge the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi</HI> gives an account of all things to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. But it ordinarily happens, that they are friends, and that the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> who does not leave his Charge, but upon his advancement to that of the place of the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould dye, or be exalted to a higher Dignity, or upon his being made a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> and Governour of a Province, propo&s;es him, among the Pages, for whom he has the greate&s;t affection, and who is his Confident, as a Per&s;on qualify'd for the Charge of principal Officers of the Trea&s;ury. Accordingly being his Benefactor, he gives in his Accompts as he plea&s;es him&s;elf, and delivering unto him an Inventory of what is in the Trea&s;ury, he withal pro|duces a <HI>Memorandum</HI> of the Pieces, which had been taken our thence, during his Sur|intendency, by the Grand Seignor's Orders. The Clark of the Trea&s;ury, might, notwith&s;tanding their intelligence and combination, di&s;cover the intrigue; but being one of the elde&s;t Pages of the Chamber, and in a capacity of advancement to the Charge of <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> he &s;huts his eyes, and &s;o avoids the creation of Enemies, thinking it more prudence, to be appeas'd, by the Pre&s;ents he receives as well from him who enters into the Charge, as from him who quits it. But the&s;e Thieveries are not very often committed, and if there were but the lea&s;t di&s;covery made threof, a &s;evere puni&s;hment would &s;oon be inflicted both on the Author and his Complices.</P>
<P>As to the little Che&s;t or Coffer, wherein the mo&s;t precious Jewels are kept, it is impo&s;&s;ible to get any thing out thence: for when the Grand Seignor would have any Piece taken out of it, he orders the Coffer it &s;elf to be brought into his Pre|&s;ence, by the principal Officer of the Trea&s;ury, accompany'd by the Keeper of the Keyes, and all the Pages; and before he opens it, he takes notice whether the Seal be entire. After he has taken what he de&s;ir'd, the Coffer is lock'd up in his Pre|&s;ence the Seal is &s;et upon it, and it is carry'd back into the Trea&s;ury with the &s;ame Ceremony. Then do the Sixty Pages receive, ordinarily &s;ome demo&s;trations of the Grand Seignor's Liberality, which may amount to ten or twelve <HI>Pur&s;es,</HI> to be divided among&s;t them.</P>

Take here an account of what occa&s;ions this Monument, which they were pleas'd to Erect, to perpetuate the memory of a Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> as I have been told it, by &s;everal Per&s;ons in <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> He was the Son of a Cow-keeper, and had fol|lowed the &s;ame Employment him&s;elf: but he had a Genius that might become a Per&s;on of the highe&s;t Extraction, and which rai&s;ed him to the Charge of Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> and the Honour of being Son-in-law to <HI>Solyman.</HI> He had many traver&s;es of Fortune, and was for &s;ome time out of Favour: but in fine, <HI>Solyman,</HI> who had great Affairs to manage, and was engaged in a War with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> coming to a little indigency of Money, &s;ent for <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> and be&s;towed on him the Superintendency of his Revenues. He knew him to be a Man of great Abilities, and capable of putting them, in a &s;hort time, into a good po&s;ture; and accordingly his pains and dili|gence in the management thereof proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that he pre&s;ently fill'd <HI>Solymon</HI>'s Coffers, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Affairs of the Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heroick Sentiment of a <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> Upon which occa&s;ion I &s;hall here &s;et down a thing which is &s;till fre&s;h in the remembrance of many <HI>Turks,</HI> who receiv'd it from their Fathers. The <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;o great a zeal for the welfare of the State. that one of the Grandees of the Port, an Enemy of <HI>Ru&s;tans,</HI> and one, who, upon other occa&s;ions, would gladly have ruin'd him, prote&s;ted to one of his Confidents, That, though it were in his power to do him an ill turn, yet he would not do it then, becau&s;e he had, by his Indu&s;trey and Labours, upheld the State, which he retriv'd from the Precipice of de&s;truction, and was in a fair way to make a con&s;iderable augmentation of its Revenues. This generous and heriock Sentiment in the Soul of a <HI>Turk,</HI> who at his fir&s;t ri&s;e was but a &s;imple Slave, would meet with but few Examples among&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>But, to rea&s;&s;ume our di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Fourth Chamber of the Trea&s;ury. It is full of Che&s;ts of two foot in length, and a breadth and depth proportionable thereto, fortify'd with plates of Iron, and made fa&s;t, each of 'em, with two Chains. The number of them is not always the &s;ame, becau&s;e the Money is coming in, and going out of that Chamber, and the Coffers are tran&s;ported thence according to the occurrent exigencies, for the payment of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and the maintenance of the Armies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The principal Sources of the Wealth of the Empire.</NOTE> All the Gold and Silver which is brought into the Trea&s;ury ri&s;es out of the Revenues of the Empire, and out of the Sale of what Goods the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> leave at their departure out of this World. As to what is rais'd out of the Empire, which dilates it &s;elf &s;o far into the three parts of our great Continent, and comprehends &s;o many Kingdoms, it may be ea&s;ily imagin'd, that it mu&s;t &s;upply the Trea&s;ury with va&s;t Sums; but it is not ea&s;ie &s;o to a&s;certain them. Its revenues con&s;i&s;t principally in the collection of the Tributes, and in the Cu&s;toms: and the three <HI>Tefterdars,</HI> or Trea&s;u|rers-General, give an account to the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> of the Receipts of the Provinces. That Principal Mini&s;ter has the cu&s;tody of one Key of that fourth Chamber of the Trea&s;ury, and the fir&s;t <HI>Tefterdar</HI> has that of another, and be&s;ides that, it is always &s;eal'd with the Grand Seignors Seal. It is ordinarily open'd, but upon tho&s;e days, on which the <HI>Divan</HI> &s;its, that is, on Council-days, either for the reception of Money into it, or for the taking of any out, to defray the Charges of the Empire.</P>
<P>What is &s;o receiv'd into it is for the mo&s;t part in Silver; and as to the Species of Gold Coins that are brought into that Chamber, they come from four Sources, two whereof are upon a Foreign account, and the other two upon that of the Coun|trey. One of the two former con&s;i&s;ts in the Commerce of the <HI>French, Engli&s;h, Dutch, Italians, Mo&s;covites,</HI> and <HI>Polanders,</HI> who bring in <HI>Ducats</HI> out of tho&s;e Provinces. The other is the annual Tribute, which the <HI>Cham</HI> of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania, Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Walachia,</HI> the Republick of <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> and part of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> are to pay the Grand Seignor in Gold, which amounts to very great Sums. One of the two Sources of the Country poceeds from what is found upon
<PB N="49" REF="298">
the removal of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> whereof the very coined Gold makes the be&s;t part; the other from the Revenue of <HI>Egypt,</HI> where there is an annual coinage of a certain number of <HI>Sequins,</HI> according to the quantity of Gold, which is brought thither out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and being coin'd into <HI>Sequins,</HI> is all convey'd thence into the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenues of <HI>Egypt</HI> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> employ'd.</NOTE> The Revenue of <HI>Egypt</HI> may amount yearly to twelve millions of Livers, (that is, about one million and two hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling)</HI> which mu&s;t be divided into three parts.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Voult under ground, into which few have acce&s;s.</NOTE> WIthin the fourth Chamber of the Trea&s;ury, you find a door laid all about with good &s;tore of Iron-bars which opens the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age, to the place that contains the Grand Seignor's Secret Trea&s;ure. It is never open'd, but when he him&s;elf has a mind to enter into it; and he do's not enter into it but when the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> adverti&s;es him, that it is time for him to do &s;o, and that there is a con&s;iderable Sum to be carried in. In the fir&s;t place, by the light of Torches they go down a Stair-Ca&s;e of ten or twelve &s;teps, at the bottom of which, after an advancement of &s;even or eight paces further, they find a &s;econd Door, fortify'd with Iron-work as the former, but much le&s;s, &s;o that a man is oblig'd to &s;toop ere he go into it. When it is open'd, and that they have made their entrance through it, as if they had pa&s;s'd through a Wicket, they are under a great Vault, where they find a great many Coffers, of the &s;ame largene&s;s, as tho&s;e of the Chamber we came la&s;t out of.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="299">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great fru|gality of the Emperour <HI>Amurat.</HI></NOTE> In tho&s;e Coffers they have, for the&s;e many years, laid up all that was not expended upon the Publick account, of the great Revenues of the <HI>Ottoman</HI>-Monarchs, and &s;o it may be call'd his Private Exchequer, into which there is nothing but Gold has entrance, all the Silver being carried into the other Trea&s;ury, to be thence taken out again and di&s;pos'd of, as occa&s;ion requir'd. After the death of <HI>Amurat, Ibrahim,</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or in the Throne, found in that Trea&s;ury four thou&s;and Bags, which they call <HI>Kizes,</HI> and every bag contains fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Ducats</HI> of Gold, which amount to thirty thou&s;and <HI>Crowns,</HI> and tho&s;e reduc'd to our Pounds, come to thirty Millions <HI>Sterling.</HI> 'Twas the &s;ame <HI>Amurat</HI> (a prudent and valiant Prince, a man of great Par&s;imony, and as great conduct in Military Affairs, of whom I have often had occa&s;ion to make mention) who enter'd into a War again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and be&s;ieg'd <HI>Bagdet,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> which he took on the Twenty Second of <HI>December,</HI> 1638. I remember, that I was then but Five Days Journey from that place, in the De&s;erts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> as having left <HI>Aleppo,</HI> in order to my going to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> and that of the Three&s;core and five dayes, which the Caravan &s;pent in that Journey, for nine of them, we were de&s;titute of Water, which mu&s;t needs pre&s;s very hard, both on the Men and the Camels.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibrahim</HI> charg'd with ill&punc;management of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> therefore, at his coming to the Crown, found, in the &s;ecret Trea&s;ury, that prodigious quantity of Gold, whereto he could not make any augmentations; nay &s;ome, on the contrary, are of opinion, That he was forc'd to u&s;e &s;ome part of it, through his ill Conduct of the Warr of <HI>Candia.</HI> True it is, That the long continuance of that Warre made a great hole in the Revenues of the Empire; but there are Two great Rea&s;ons, which divert me from giving ab&s;olute credit, to &s;uch as affirm, That tho&s;e Exigencies reach'd the Secret Trea&s;ury, For, in &s;hort, it is as 'twere a fundamental Law among them, That, before any thing is taking out thence, it is requi&s;ite, the Empire &s;hould be in imminent danger of ruine; And it is manife&s;t, That though the <HI>Turks</HI> could not reduce <HI>Candia</HI> under their Juri&s;diction, yet their Empire was &s;o far from being near its decadence, that it &s;till continu'd powerful. Be&s;ides, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That when the Grand Seignor lo&s;es a Battel, it is a di&s;advantage to his provinces, upon the &s;core of their being thereby depopulated, and &s;o much the le&s;s cultivated; but that it is an advantage to his Coffers, in regard there's &s;o much the le&s;s comes out of them. The rea&s;on of it is evident, becau&s;e he pays the Veteranes, or Souldiers of long &s;tanding, &s;even or eight <HI>A&s;pers</HI> a day, and that tho&s;e of the new-rais'd Forces do not &s;tand him in above one and a half, or two at the mo&s;t; their pay augmenting with the time, an&s;werably to their &s;ervices, and the Prince's good Plea&s;ure. Whereto it is to be added, That when an Em|perour dies, his Succe&s;&s;or augments the pay of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> by an <HI>A&s;per,</HI> or two, <HI>per diem.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd indeed, That there died a great number of <HI>Turks</HI> in the Warr of <HI>Candia:</HI> but it is certain al&s;o, That if we con&s;ider the great number of Kingdoms and Provinces, whereof the Empire con&s;i&s;ts, among which there are &s;ome very fertile, and very well peopled, it is an ea&s;ie matter to rai&s;e numerous Armies, and to recruit them, when they have been weakned, by a Defeat, or by &s;ome Sickne&s;s, which often happens among them. Upon the&s;e two grounds, I cannot be induced to believe, that <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was oblig'd to make any diminution of the Secret Trea&s;ury: but I am very apt to believe, that he made not any great additions thereto, becau&s;e he had not either the good Conduct, or good Fortune of <HI>Amurat,</HI> and ordinarily, the one avails not much without the other.</P>
<P>All the Gold that lies interr'd under that Vault is in Leather-bags, every Bag containing Fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Ducats,</HI> that is Seven thou&s;and five hundred pounds <HI>Sterling:</HI> and 'tis with his own hand that the Grand Seignor puts his Seal to them, which is the &s;ame that his Predece&s;&s;ors had us'd before him, &s;ave only the name, which mu&s;t be that of the Prince then reigning. <HI>Amurat</HI>'s Seal had the&s;e words <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignor's Pre|cautions for the &s;ecurity of his Trea&s;ury.</NOTE>graven upon it. <HI>Na&s;rum min allahi abdihil melekil Mourath.</HI> Which &s;ignifies, <HI>The A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God is upon his Servant the Emperour</HI> Amurath.</P>
<P>And this is the manner how the Bags of Gold is brought into the Secret Trea|&s;ury. All the Gold and Silver which come into the Seraglio, is fir&s;t carried into
<PB N="51" REF="299">
the Chamber of the Trea&s;ury, and each of them is di&s;pos'd into the Coffers de&s;ign'd for them. When there is as much Gold as will amount to two hundred <HI>Kizes,</HI> the Grand <HI>Vizir</HI> gives notice of it to the Grand Seignor, who appoints a day, for the di&s;po&s;al of it into the Secret Trea&s;ury. The day being come, the Grand Seignor, led under the Arm by the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> who is on the left hand, which is accounted the more honourable among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> and by the <HI>Seligdar-Aga</HI> who is on the right, comes into the Chamber of the Trea&s;ury, where the Sixty Pages expect him, ranked in order on both &s;ides, with their hands cro&s;s their Brea&s;ts. The Grand Seignor, having pa&s;s'd through the Chamber, and order'd the fir&s;t Door of the Secret Trea&s;ury to be open'd, enters into it, by the light of &s;everal Torches of white Wax, and is followed by the Pages, two by two, till they are within the Vault, into which the Bags are brought, ty'd with a Silk-&s;tring. Upon the &s;tring they put a piece of red &s;oft Wax, whereto the Grand Seignor &s;ets his Seal him&s;elf, which is upon a Gold-Ring, wherein are engraven the words before mentioned, with the name of the Prince then reigning, after which they put the Bags into the Coff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> which are all double chain'd.</P>

They &s;tay for him in the Fourth Chamber, when he is to come out of the Vault and then he orders the Coffer of his Jewels to be opened, to &s;hew them the mo&s;t precious things there are in it. And whereas there are always &s;ome Favourites attending there, as al&s;o divers other per&s;ons, whom the Prince looks upon kindly upon the &s;core of their merit, it &s;eldom hap|pens, but that they all receive &s;ome Pre&s;ent or other from him, and he makes not any, but what is of very con&s;iderable value. The Trea&s;ury being &s;hut up, the Grand Seignor returns to his own Quarter, and all the Grandees accompany him to the Gate of it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Means which the Grand Seignor makes u&s;e of, to augment his Trea&s;ures, be&s;ides what is done by the ordinary Revenues of the Empire.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PRINCIPAL HEADS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pre&s;ents made by the Ba&s;&s;a's to the Grand Seignor, when they enter into their Charges. The Trade driven by the <HI>Jews</HI> very hazardous to them. The extraordi|nary Wealth of the Ba&s;&s;a's. The great Advantages of the <HI>Chaznadar-Bachi,</HI> and the Pages of the Trea&s;ury. The prohibition of lending Money upon Intere&s;t. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> but poor Ca&s;ui&s;ts. Formalities ob&s;erved in <HI>Turkey</HI> about Schedules.</HEAD>
<P>BE&s;ides what may be left every Year in the Trea&s;ury, or Exchequer, out of the ordinary Revenues of the Empire, after all charges deducted, the Grand Seignor has Two other Expedients very Conducive to the augmentation of both the Trea&s;uries, to wit, the entrance of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s upon their Governments, and their removal out of them, whether it be by &s;ome di&s;grace, or by their natural, or violent deaths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ba&s;&s;as</HI> Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Grand Seig|nor,</HI> upon their advancements.</NOTE> All the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> on whom the Grand Seignor be&s;towes Governments, and gene|rally all tho&s;e, who are remov'd out of the Seraglio, upon their advancement into Charges, are oblig'd, before they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, to make him Pre&s;ents, every one, an&s;werable to the benefit he has receiv'd from the Prince. For example, the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as ever he is nominated to that Government, knows, that two Millions of Livers, that is reduc'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> account, two hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>&s;terling,</HI> will hardly make good the Pre&s;ents, which are expected from him at the Port, that is, tho&s;e due to the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI> him&s;elf, and to the principal <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> as al&s;o to the <HI>Mufti,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizir,</HI> the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> and other Per&s;ons of Credit in the Court to whom he is ingag'd for his advancement to that Charge, and of whom he may &s;tand in need for the future. The Pre&s;ent he makes the Grand Seignor him&s;elf, amounts to Five hundred thou&s;and Crowns, and the re&s;t will come to Two hundred thou&s;and. Add again to that, Five hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which will be expended in the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> equipage, and &s;o before he &s;ets his foot in <HI>Cairo,</HI> his own Pur&s;e, or tho&s;e of his Friends, will be drain'd of Three Millons and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Livers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hazardous Trade of the <HI>Jews.</HI></NOTE> When he comes out of the Seraglio, if he want much of the afore&s;aid Summe, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing; and if the pur&s;e of his Friends cannot do it, tho&s;e of the <HI>Jewes</HI> are readily open'd for his &s;upply. They run a great hazard, upon hopes of the great profit of makeing <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> intere&s;t which the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> does promi&s;e them. And to be the &s;ooner reimburs'd of the Money they have &s;o hazarded, lea&s;t his Government be but a &s;hort one, they teach him a thou&s;and

But, one the other &s;ide, they run a great hazard in regard that it happens, many times, the Grand Seignor &s;ends for the head of a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> before he has had time enough to &s;ettle him&s;elf in his new Government, and then, they who have lent him Money are not to hope ever to recover any part of it.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it may ea&s;ily be concluded, That the greate&s;t part of the Money of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire is in the Grand Seignor's hands, and among the <HI>Jews;</HI> I mean the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> For as to tho&s;e who live in the Provinces, the world goes but ill with them, and they are in a much more wretched condition, than the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> in regard they do not follow any thing of Husbandry: and their inclinations being altogether bent for Traffick, and the management of the publick Taxes or the Cu&s;toms, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be employment for them all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> The Grand Seignor therefore receives very con&s;iderable Summs from the Ba&s;&s;a's, and other per&s;ons, on whom he be&s;tows Charges, even before they have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. But that amounts to little or nothing in compari&s;on of the advantages which he makes, upon their removal out of them, and e&s;pecially when they have had a fair time to gather Trea&s;ures, by their in&s;upportable ex|actions from the people. Some of the&s;e Ba&s;&s;a's have come to that exce&s;&s;ive Wealth and Power, that their Revenues were equal to tho&s;e of many great Princes. Such was the fortune of one <HI>Machmut, Beglierbeg</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second; and that, of the Grand <HI>Vizir Na&s;&s;uf,</HI> under <HI>Achmet</HI> the Fir&s;t. At the death of the latter, there were extraordinary Riches found in his Hou&s;e, in Silver, Gold, and Jewels, and all was brought to the Seraglio, along with his head.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be conjectur'd, by the number of the greater and le&s;&s;er Govern|ments, whereof the Empire con&s;i&s;ts, that there is a con&s;iderable mortality among&s;t tho&s;e, who derive their Charges and Fortunes from the pure Munificence of the Grand Seignor, and who&s;e acqui&s;itions thereupon falling to him, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make va&s;t additionals to the Seraglio. But be&s;ides tho&s;e who are gently convey'd out of this World, by a natural death, there hardly pa&s;&s;es a year but, violent death comes and acts its part, and upon the lea&s;t jealou&s;ie, or any fanta&s;tick apprehen&s;ion the Grand Seignor may have, a Ba&s;&s;a receives a peremptory Order to &s;tretch out his Neck, and he is immediately &s;trangled. In the next Chapter, I &s;hall give the Reader an Account, of the formality and ceremony, which is ob&s;erv'd upon that occa&s;ion, where he will find &s;omewhat worth his remarking; and I think I may confidently affirm, That they who know it is the cu&s;tome, to &s;trangle tho&s;e, who&s;e Lives the Grand Seignor would take away, know not all the Particulars ob&s;ervable in that Action.</P>

The <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> having di&s;|pos'd them into one of the Chambers, Commands the Locks to be broke open, and the Coffers to be emptied in his pre&s;ence; And 'tis then, that as well he him|&s;elf, as the Pages of the Trea&s;ury endeavour to make their advantages of that Rich Booty. For there being ordinarily, among&s;t the other things, Jewels of great value, &s;uch as that wherein the Heron-tops are fa&s;ten'd in their Turbants, or a Ponyard enrich'd with precious Stones, or &s;ome Carcanet of Pearls, if one or other of tho&s;e Pages can make a dexterous and clean conveyance of &s;ome Piece, 'tis his own and he puts it to what el&s;e he has in &s;tock, reflecting on what he has to do, at his departure out of the Seraglio, in order to his e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;ome Charge, and the great Expences he mu&s;t be at upon that account. The <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> who does his work fir&s;t of all, and with more liberty, does &s;ometimes connive at what he &s;ees done by the others, remembring that he has been as they are, and was then glad, that he was not reprov'd for &s;o doing. Yet if he perceives that any one of them has &s;ecur'd to him&s;elf a piece of great value, a&s;&s;oon as he is got to his Chamber, he &s;ecretly &s;ends for him, and makes him re&s;tore it, paying him one half of its worth, and &s;o keeps it him&s;elf.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great ad|vantages of the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> and the Pages of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> There are yet other great advantages accrewing to the Chief Officer, and the Pages, from tho&s;e things which are brought into the Seraglio, upon the death of the Ba&s;&s;a's. When the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi</HI> has advertis'd the Grand Seignor, that, in the Coffers, which had been brought in, there were many things not fit for the Service of his Highne&s;s, and that it were better to put them off, before they were injur'd by the moi&s;ture or the du&s;t; the Prince gives his permi&s;&s;ion for the &s;ale thereof, and therupon they take out of the Trea&s;ury what they do not account worthy of a place there. Immediatedly, they &s;end for the <HI>Bazarcan-bachi,</HI> or Chief of the Merchants, who is the be&s;t skill'd in tho&s;e things, and who, in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> and the Pages of the Trea&s;ury, &s;ets a value on every piece, to their &s;atisfaction; for he does not prize it at above half the worth. All the Jewels that will bear a good price, and all the precious &s;tones are di&s;pos'd into the Trea&s;ury, and they expo&s;e to &s;ale only things of le&s;s value, yet &s;uch as are worth much: as Trappings for Hor&s;es, Ponyards, Sabres, garni&s;h'd with Gold, Garments, rich Furres, Sa&s;ches, Turbants, and other things of that nature; all the pieces being valued, the <HI>Cha&s;nadar-bachi</HI> &s;ets a&s;ide the be&s;t of them, to be &s;ent, together with the value &s;et upon them, to the principal per&s;ons of the Seraglio, with whom he is glad to hold a fair corre&s;pondence, and they pay for them the more willingly, becau&s;e they have them at an ea&s;ie rate. The re&s;t is di&s;tributed among the Pages, according to the valuation, and having made choice of &s;uch things as they will keep them&s;elves, &s;end away what they do not like, to be &s;old in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> by the <HI>Halvagis,</HI> wherein they al&s;o make a va&s;t advantage, con&s;idering the appri&s;ement; not accounting what the &s;ame <HI>Halvagis</HI> may hedge in for them&s;elves, as a compen&s;ation for their trouble.</P>
<P>When there is &s;uch a &s;ale made, the <HI>Jews</HI> are always waiting about the great Gate of the Seraglio, not daring to come too near, for fear of a cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Ba&s;tinado from the <HI>Kapigis,</HI> which they are very free to give them. They &s;tand in expectation of the&s;e <HI>Halvagis,</HI> with their bags full of Ducats and Ryals, and make the be&s;t bargains they can with them. The&s;e &s;ales are &s;eldome made above once in two years, and the lea&s;t of them does ordinarily exceed five hundred thou&s;and Crowns, nay &s;ome have amounted to eight hundred Thou&s;and. The Grand Seignor is &s;oon advertis'd, what money has been rais'd by the &s;ale, and giving orders for the di&s;po&s;al of it into the Trea&s;ury, he at the &s;ame time be&s;tows ten or twenty Pur&s;es on the principal Officer, and the Pages of the Trea&s;ury. He does not make them that Pre&s;ent out of any other de&s;ign, then to &s;hew his Gran|deur, as being not ignorant of the advantages they have made by the Sale; but he tolerates that cu&s;tome, and knows well enough, that &s;ooner or later, all tho&s;e profits will come again into the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prohibition to lend at In|tere&s;t.</NOTE> 'Tis upon the &s;ame con&s;ideration, that the Grand Seignor permits a manife&s;t breach of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which prohibits the taking of any intere&s;t for money lent; for he &s;uffers the Pages, and others to lend con&s;iderable &s;ums to the <HI>Jewes,</HI> at the rate of fifteen upon the hundred, intere&s;t. And the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have found out a very plea&s;ant eva&s;ion, to &s;tave off the reproach which might be made to them, of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the &s;ame prohibition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> ill Ca&s;ui&s;ts.</NOTE> The eva&s;ion is this. When they lend out mony to any one, they have a Bill or Schedule made of the &s;um that's lent. Then they compute what the intere&s;t will amount to, which is commonly after the rate of twelve in the Hundred. That done; they take a handkerchief, or &s;ome old Sa&s;che, and giving it to the Per&s;on whom they lend the money to, they make him write a &s;econd Note, upon the &s;core of the intere&s;t, wherein it is expre&s;t, that the debt is for commodities bought, and duly receiv'd. And thus do they think to elude the reproaches of their own Con&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">encies, and imagine, that they do not offend again&s;t the prohibition of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The promi&s;e which the Debtor makes in writng, is not &s;ign'd by him, it being not the cu&s;tom of the Countrey, but he puts his &s;eal to it. And yet that too is not &s;ufficient, and it is further requi&s;ite, that they go before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> or the Judge of the Law, who con&s;ummates the work, by putting his own Seal to the writing.</P>

<P>THE Two expedients which the Grand Seignor makes u&s;e of to augment his Trea&s;ury, be&s;ides what comes in by the ordinary revenues of the Em|pire, are much of the &s;ame nature, with tho&s;e he u&s;es, to be&s;tow great large&s;&s;es, without disbur&s;ing any thing him&s;elf. He makes his ad|vantages of all; the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> are as &s;o many &s;punges, and he &s;queezes them, as well while they are living, as when they are dead, and at their co&s;t a&s;&s;igns recompence to tho&s;e, who have done him &s;ome acceptable &s;ervice. Let us take things in order, one after another, and &s;hew in the fir&s;t place, how he manages his &s;ubtle de&s;ign, while the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> are living, in getting out of them wherewithall to make ample gratifications, without any diminution of his Revenues.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Political maximes of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchs, this is one of the mo&s;t remarkable. They would have the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> to be re&s;pected in their &s;everal Governments, by the People, as much as if they were there them&s;elves in Per|&s;on: and to make a greater, and a more lively impre&s;&s;ion of that veneration in their minds, they think it fitting, to honour them, from time to time, with &s;ome Pre&s;ent, which is carried to them with much Ceremony. This Pre&s;ent, which is a certain demon&s;tration of the E&s;teem, which the Prince has for the Per&s;on to whom he &s;ends it, is commonly &s;ome Rich Garment; and when he is willing to make it compleat, he adds the Sabre, and the Ponyard, garni&s;h'd and adorn'd with precious &s;tones. The Grand Seignor, upon the con&s;ideration before-mention|ed, finding him&s;elf as it were oblig'd to make a Pre&s;ent to that <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> knowes well enough, that he will be &s;ure, on the other &s;ide, to &s;end him one which &s;hall be worth ten times as much, and to make another to his Envoy, which he mu&s;t look on as a recompence of his Services.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="302">
But it is not always the Grand Seignor's de&s;ign, by &s;uch Pre&s;ents, to honour the Ba&s;&s;a, and keep the People the more in &s;ubjection to him. It happens many times, that when he intends to ruine him, he makes him a Pre&s;ent, that he may thence take occa&s;ion, in ca&s;e he does not receive another from him, &s;uch as he de&s;ires, to &s;end another Me&s;&s;enger for his Head. The Pre&s;ent, upon that occa|&s;ion, is not a Ve&s;t, or a Garment, but, a Sword, or a Battle-Axe, which are very Ominous Pre&s;ents, and Adverti&s;ements to the Ba&s;&s;a, that the Grand Seignor has little kindne&s;s for him. To divert the Storm, which he &s;ees likely to fall upon him, he doubles the Pre&s;ent he &s;hould have made, in ca&s;e he had &s;ent him but a Ve&s;t, which is a pledge of his Affection. And if that Ba&s;&s;a be one of tho&s;e, who Commands in the greater Governments, the Pre&s;ent which he &s;ends to the Grand Seignor, ought not to amount to le&s;s than Two hundred Pur&s;es, that is to &s;ay, a Hundred thou&s;and Crowns, not comprehending what is particularly given to the per&s;on who is &s;ent by the Emperour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ceremonies attending the Pre&s;ents &s;ent by the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI> to tho&s;e whom he would honour.</NOTE> The Per&s;ons charg'd with this Commi&s;&s;ion are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch as the Grand Seignor is willing to be Munificent to. So that, all things con&s;ider'd, the Pre&s;ent is not &s;o much de&s;ign'd for him who receives it, as for him who &s;ends it, and the Per&s;on who carries it: And in this con&s;i&s;ts the artifice of exerci&s;ing great Liberalities without disbur&s;ing any thing. The Ceremony perform'd at the de|livery of this Pre&s;ent of the Grand Seignor, is this: He who carries it being come to the place where the Ba&s;&s;a lives, to whom it is &s;ent, and having advertis'd him of it, this latter, with the noi&s;e of Drums, Trumpets, and Hawboys, a&s;&s;embles the People together, &s;ome of whom mount them&s;elves on Hor&s;e-back, to do him the greater honour. The Ba&s;&s;a him&s;elf marches in the Head of all, and they who are not mounted follow afoot, together with the Curtezans, or common Strum|pets of the place, who are obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this Ceremony, dancing after a Tabour, and putting them&s;elves into a thou&s;and la&s;civious po&s;tures, according to the Cu&s;tome of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;enger who brings the Pre&s;ent makes a halt, in expectation of this Cavalcade, in &s;ome Garden near the City, or in the Fields under a Tent, which he had got &s;et up for that purpo&s;e. After mutual Salutations, he ca&s;ts the Ve&s;t over the Ba&s;&s;a's &s;houlders, putting the Sabre by his Side, and thru&s;ts the Ponyard into his Sa&s;che before his Brea&s;t, telling him, That the Emperour their Ma&s;ter, honours him with that Pre&s;ent, upon the good report which had been made to him, that he has demean'd him&s;elf well, that he does not tyrannize over his People, and that there is no Complaint made, of his being defective in the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This Complement pa&s;t, the Ba&s;&s;a, in the &s;ame order, and amid&s;t the Joyful Acclamations of the People, takes his way, and the Grand Seignor's Envoy along with him, towards his Hou&s;e, where he entertains him at a great Treat, and, after all is done, with a Pre&s;ent, which amounts to Ten thou&s;and Crowns at the lea&s;t. For, as I told you before, if the Pre&s;ent be carried to one of the Ba&s;&s;a's who are in the greater Governments, as the Ba&s;&s;a's of <HI>Buda, Cairo,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> they &s;hall not e&s;cape under Thirty or Forty thou&s;and Crowns, and the Pre&s;ent which is &s;ent to the Sultan, ought to amount to a hundred thou&s;and. Nay it many times happens, that the Grand Seignor appoints what he would have their Pre&s;ent to his Envoy to amount to, and that e&s;pecially, when he &s;ends &s;uch as he has a particular kindne&s;s for, and would amply gratifie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The particular way us'd by <HI>Mahomet IV.</HI> to &s;hew him&s;elf liberal, without any Charge.</NOTE> The Emperour <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, who now &s;its on the Throne, has a par|ticular inclination to exerci&s;e Liberality, and to be&s;tow Rewards on tho&s;e who &s;erve him; but he does it &s;o, as that it co&s;ts him nothing, and con&s;equently, there is no occa&s;ion of taking ought out of the Trea&s;ury. When there is not an op|portunity to &s;end the Per&s;on whom he has a de&s;ire to gratifie, into the Country with &s;ome Pre&s;ent, he has another Expedient, which will do the work. His Darling Diverti&s;ement is Hunting, and he takes but little plea&s;ure in any other Exerci&s;e. He thereupon orders the Per&s;on whom he would recompence, to be one at the Sport, and having kill'd a Stagg, or &s;ome other Bea&s;t, he orders him to go and pre&s;ent it, from him, to one of the Grandees of the Port, who&s;e abode is either at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or &s;ome place near it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="302">
This Pre&s;ent is receiv'd with great demon&s;trations of joy, real, or apparent, the per&s;on, to whom it is brought, is immediately to take order for the &s;end|ing back of another, much exceeding it in value, to the Grand Seignor. And that con&s;i&s;ts ordinarily in excellent Hor&s;es, good pieces of Gold-Brocado, or rich Furrs. But his work is yet not half over; there mu&s;t be much more done for him, through who&s;e hands he has receiv'd the Pre&s;ent, and he &s;capes very well, when, not accounting what he &s;ends to the Grand Seignor, the carriage of it co&s;ts him but Ten thou&s;and Crowns. Nay many times, he is forc'd to double the Sum, when he has not been &s;o liberal, as the Prince expected he &s;hould have been; for he pre&s;ently di&s;patches away an Officer, to reproach him with the &s;lender account he has made of his Pre&s;ent, and the &s;mall recompence he had receiv'd, whom he had employ'd to bring it him. To the&s;e reproaches he &s;ends him an expre&s;s Order, to make an additional Reward of Twenty or thirty Pur&s;es, which is immediately put in execution: and as to the Pre&s;ent which the Grand Seingor has receiv'd, he commonly makes a di&s;tribution of it, among&s;t tho&s;e, who are then about him.</P>
<P>And the&s;e are the Advantages which the Grand Seignor &s;crews out of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and other Grandees of the Port, whil&s;t they are alive. Let us now con|&s;ider tho&s;e which accrew to him by their death, in order to the recompen&s;ing of tho&s;e, whom he favours, without being oblig'd to take any thing out of his Coffers. When the death of a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> is re&s;olv'd upon, the Grand Seignor delivers the Commi&s;&s;ion to him, whom he has de&s;ign'd to be kind to; and he finds it much more advantagous, to bring him the Sentence of his death, than to bring him a Pre&s;ent from the Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Formalities ob|&s;erv'd at the death of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> who are &s;trangled by the Princes Orders.</NOTE> If the Execution is to be done in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> the ordinary Executioner is the <HI>Bo&s;tangi bachi,</HI> who is alwaies about the Grand Seignor's Per&s;on, and he him&s;elf does the Work. But if there be a nece&s;&s;ity of going into &s;ome remote Province, 'tis commonly either a <HI>Capigi-bachi,</HI> or one of the principal <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> whom the Prince has a mind to &s;hew his kindne&s;s to, who is &s;ent to perform the Execution. He who carries the Order, accompany'd by five or &s;ix <HI>Capigis,</HI> &s;ometimes man|ages his Affairs &s;o, as to arrive at the place, while the Council is &s;itting. But if that cannot be &s;o order'd, he goes to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> and commands him in the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI>'s name, to call one immediately. That Council con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> Lieu|tenant, the <HI>Mufti,</HI> the <HI>Cadi,</HI> the chief Commander of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> belonging to that place, and &s;ome other per&s;ons concern'd in the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, who are of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Province.</P>
<P>The Council being a&s;&s;embled, the <HI>Capigi-bachi</HI> enters, attended by his people, and pre&s;ents the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> with the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI>'s Letter. He recives it with great re|&s;pect, and having put it three &s;everal times to his forehead, he opens it, reads it and finds that the Prince demands his head. He makes no other an&s;wer to that Order, then what he does in the&s;e few words; <HI>Let the Will,</HI> &s;ays he <HI>of my Emperour be done: onely give me leave to &s;ay my Prayers</HI> which is granted him. His Prayers being ended, the <HI>Capigis</HI> &s;eize him by the Arms and the chief of them pre&s;ently takes off his Girdle or Sa&s;che, and ca&s;t it about his Neck. That Girdle con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal &s;mall &s;trings of Silk, with knots at both ends, which two of the company immediately catch hold of, one drawing one way, and the other, t'other-way they di&s;patch him in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>If they are unwilling to make u&s;e of their Girdle they take a handkerchief, and with the Ring which they u&s;e, in the bending of their Bowes, and which they or|dinarily wear on the right-hand Thumb, they thru&s;t the hand between the hand|kerchief, which is ty'd very clo&s;e, and the Throat, and &s;o break the very Throat-Bone. Thus they make a &s;hift to &s;trangle a man in an in&s;tant, &s;uffering him not to langui&s;h in pain, that he may dye a faithful <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and not have the time to enter into de&s;pair; the <HI>Turks</HI> thinking our way of hanging Criminals, who are &s;o long in torment upon the Gibbet a &s;trange kind of Execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When and how they &s;trike off the Head in <HI>Turkey.</HI></NOTE> Though I have often us'd this expre&s;&s;ion, That the <HI>Grand Seignor</HI> &s;ends to demand the Head of any per&s;on, whom he would rid out of the way; yet they never cut it off, but when he expre&s;ly declares his de&s;ire to &s;ee it, and then it is brought to him.

<P>They therefore think it prudence, to connive at what ever is done by that En|voy, as being otherwi&s;e per&s;waded, that he will not be di&s;own'd by the Grand Seignor, who is not ignorant of what's done upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions. Nay on the contrary, and whatever he may have dextrou&s;ly &s;ecured to him&s;elf of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> Goods, they make him &s;ome additional Pre&s;ents of their own, at his own de|parture from them, engaging him thereby, to &s;peak well of them to the Grand Seignor, and to the Grand <HI>Vizir,</HI> at his return to the Port. And then al&s;o, not accounting what he had taken before-hand, and what Cu&s;tom tolerates, he receives new marks of the Liberality of his Prince, who is &s;atisfy'd that he has &s;o faithfully executed his Orders and &s;o he participates of what is &s;et down in the Inventory, when the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> Goods are brought into the Seraglio.</P>

If there be the lea&s;t di&s;covery made thereof, the Governour of the Frontier places would immediately have Orders from the Port, to take the Field; nay if there were not any &s;uch, they are but over-diligent, in enquiring after, and informing them|&s;elves of all tho&s;e, who pa&s;s through the extent of their Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though there were &s;ome likelihood of compa&s;&s;ing it, and that, tra|velling only in the Night time a man might get into &s;ome Neighbouring State; yet <HI>Turkey</HI> being in a manner quite &s;urrounded by Nations who abhor the Domi|nation of the <HI>Ottomans;</HI> 'twere as much as to leap out of the Frying-pan into the Fire, and to go and pa&s;s for a Spy, among&s;t a &s;ort of people, who would give no quarter. Whence it might be imagin'd, that there were le&s;s difficulty in at|tempting an a&s;cape by Sea, than to hazard it by Land: but the former is the much more difficult, and the &s;evere prohibitions made to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> upon pain of death, not to take any <HI>Turk</HI> or Slave, into their Ships, which are ex|actly &s;earch'd, before they weigh Anchor, &s;hut up all the Ports of <HI>Turkey,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e of the Country, who might be de&s;irous to get out of it.</P>
<P>True it is, however, that few years pa&s;s, but that a con&s;iderable number of Slaves are convey'd away, by the charity and contrivances of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Con&s;uls, and Merchants. They are &s;ecretly kept at the Hou&s;es of &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Inhabitants of the Country, who&s;e Secrecy and &s;ilence are bought with Money; and the &s;ame receipt &s;tops the mouths of tho&s;e, who have the over-&s;ight of the Ports, and are warmly entertain'd with drinking, while thy cunningly get the Slaves aboard the Ve&s;&s;el, which has been vi&s;ited, and is then ready to &s;et &s;ail.

They know well enough, that, whether it be by Sea, or Land, (ex|cepting only the Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they are hated upon the account of the difference of Sects) they cannot make their e&s;cape any where but into Chri&s;ten|dom, where they would not be permitted the exerci&s;e of their <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, which they would not renounce for a thou&s;and lives.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third part of the Revenue of <HI>Egypt,</HI> how employ'd.</NOTE> Three Millions of <HI>Livers,</HI> of Twelve, of annual Revenue, which the Kingdom of <HI>Egypt</HI> pays the <HI>Grand Seignor,</HI> are partly expended in the Rich Carpet, and the Sumptuous Tent, which he &s;ends to the <HI>Sheck,</HI> every year, in honour to <HI>Mabomet</HI>'s Tomb. Another part goes to the payment of tho&s;e who &s;erve in the Mo&s;queys; As for in&s;tance, the <HI>Imans,</HI> who are Prie&s;ts; the <HI>Cheuchs,</HI> who are their Preachers; the <HI>Muezims,</HI> who, by their noi&s;e on the Towers of the Mo&s;queys, call the people to their Devotions; and the <HI>Kaijms</HI> of <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> who look to, and keep clean the Mo&s;queys, and light the Lamps. We mu&s;t al&s;o put into the Account of the&s;e Three Millions, the Su&s;tenance of all the Pilgrims for the &s;pace of Seven|teen dayes, the Grand Seignor &s;ending, for that end, a &s;ufficient Summe to the <HI>Sheck.</HI> This <HI>Sheck,</HI> who is, as 'twere the Supream Per&s;on upon the &s;core of the Law, and the high Prie&s;t of all the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> what Country and Sect &s;oever they be of, makes the poor ignorant people believe, that there come every year to <HI>Mecha,</HI> Seventy thou&s;and Pilgrims, Men and Women; and if that number were not compleat, the Angels would come in humane forms, to make it up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Wealth of the <HI>Sheck</HI> of <HI>Me|cha.</HI></NOTE> This Prince, whom we call the <HI>Sheck,</HI> for whom all the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> have a great Veneration, is very Rich, and very powerful, and that may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd, by the Pre&s;ents, which he receives every year from the Grand Seig|nor, and the other <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes. The Pre&s;ents are all his own, to be di&s;|pos'd of as he plea&s;es, at the end of the Year, when new ones are &s;ent to him. He makes his advantage al&s;o of all the pre&s;ents that are made by the Pilgrims, and of the Summes of Mony, which tho&s;e very Princes &s;end him, to be di&s;tributed in Alms, which he al&s;o di&s;po&s;es of as he plea&s;es; and all the&s;e Pre&s;ents put together, make him &s;uch a Revenue as is hardly imaginable.

<P><PB N="61" REF="304">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies ob|&s;erv'd at <HI>Ma|homet's</HI> Tomb.</NOTE> From &s;everal Parts of the World, there come Caravans to <HI>Mecha,</HI> and when the Devotion is to begin, the High Prie&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the people belonging to the Law, &s;pends night and day, in &s;aying of Prayers, and performing the nece&s;&s;ary Ceremonies. On the Seventh day, all the Pilgrims are a&s;&s;embled together before the <HI>Sheck's</HI> Tent, who appears at the entrance of it, and &s;tanding upon a low Stool, that he may be &s;een by tho&s;e who are at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from him, Prayes, and gives his Bendiction to all the people, putting a period to the Devo|tion, with the&s;e words, <HI>That God would enable them to return in Peace, as they came thither.</HI></P>
<P>From that minute, every one mu&s;t bethink him&s;elf, that he is to be at his own charge; the <HI>Sheck</HI> gives no more, and 'tis then that he begins to make great advantage to him&s;elf. For whatever is &s;old for the Su&s;tenance of the Pilgrims, comes from him; and be&s;ides, he holds a corre&s;pondence with the Ma&s;ters of the Caravans, of whom the Pilgrims are forc'd to buy conveniences for their ride|ing back again, at more then three times the rate they are worth, when the Bea&s;ts they had brought out of their own Countries have fail'd them by the way.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Caravan of <HI>Cairo.</HI></NOTE> The Caravan of <HI>Cairo</HI> is the mo&s;t numerous, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the Caravans, that come to <HI>Mecha.</HI> The <HI>Caravan-bachi,</HI> who is the Captain and Conductor of it, makes his gains by it, at his return, worth him Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns; and there is a great competition about his place, which is at the di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> and commonly carried by the highe&s;t bidder for it. The Captain of this Caravan is al&s;o Ma&s;ter of the Waters, which are carried into the Ci&s;terns, and it is according to his Orders that they are di&s;tributed; and whereas that di&s;tribution is equal, as well in Relation to the Poor, as to the Rich, if the latter would have any beyond the quantity allow'd them, they mu&s;t pay dearly for it; and the Captain, who &s;ets what impo&s;ition he plea&s;es upon it, makes a con&s;iderable advantage thereby.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre&s;ent &s;ent from <HI>Me|cha</HI> to the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> But let us return to the Grand Seignor's Pre&s;ent. The Tent, and the Carpet, which he &s;ends, are two Pieces equally precious, as well for the excellency of the Stuffe, as the additional embelli&s;hments hereof. The Carpet is de&s;ign'd for the covering of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb; and the Tent, which is erected hard by the Mo&s;|quey, is for the <HI>Sheck,</HI> who does not &s;tirr out of it, during the Seventeen dayes of Devotion. This high Prie&s;t of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law, has found out the Secret knack, of extracting inexpre&s;&s;ible Summs of Money, out of that Carpet and Tent, which are renew'd every year: and when the new Pre&s;ent is arriv'd from the Grand Seignor, he &s;ends, as 'twere out of a &s;ingular favour, certain pieces of the Curtain of the old Tent, to &s;everal <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes, of whom he receives Magnificent Pre&s;ents in requital. This Curtain, which is &s;et up on the out-&s;ide of the Tent, quite round it, to hinder the people from &s;eeing tho&s;e that are under it, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal pieces, &s;ix foot high, and of a great length: and the <HI>Sheck</HI> endeavours to per&s;wade tho&s;e Princes, That if they fa&s;ten one of tho&s;e pieces to their Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, when they are going to engage in a War, again&s;t tho&s;e whom they account Infidels, good fortune will be &s;ure to attend them, and it will not be long e're they gain the Victory. But if he &s;ends either the whole Curtain, or the Tent, or Carpet entire, it mu&s;t be to a great Monarch indeed, &s;uch as the great <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or the Great <HI>Mogul:</HI> and that he does, once in ten, or twelve years; one while to the one, and another, to the other.</P>
<P>Of this we have a late in&s;tance, in <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> who at the pre&s;ent is King of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and whom we otherwi&s;e call the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI> For upon his e&s;tabli&s;hment in his Throne, the <HI>Sheck</HI> &s;ent him the whole Courtain belonging to the Tent; and great joy there was at his Court, that the King had receiv'd &s;o Magnificent a Pre|&s;ent, from the <HI>Holy Place,</HI> as they call it. The <HI>Sheck</HI> was &s;oon after made &s;en&s;ible of the Royal Liberality of that Great Monarch, one of the Riche&s;t and mo&s;t Powerful of the Univer&s;e; and thus does that Spiritual Head of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, who has a kind of Superintendency over all the Members, know how to make his advantage of them, and has found out the way, to enrich him&s;elf, at the co&s;t of all the Princes and Nations, who &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="305">
I que&s;tion not, but that they who have writ of the Religion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> have given &s;ome account of the Pilgrimage of <HI>Meeha,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts thereof; and therefore, as well for that rea&s;on, as al&s;o for that I &s;hould digre&s;s too much from my &s;ubject, I ought not to pro&s;ecute that matter any farther. I &s;hall take occa&s;ion here, to make three Remaks, which I have originally learnt of one of the mo&s;t learned in the Rubricks of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> by an ancient Tradition, believe, That <HI>Mecha</HI> is the place where God commanded <HI>Abraham</HI> to build him an hou&s;e; and that while he was there, all Nations came thronging to vi&s;it him: and that it is al&s;o the &s;ame place, where <HI>Mahomet</HI> receiv'd the Alcoran, from Heaven.</P>
<P>The &s;econd relates to the Commandement impos'd upon all the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> to be, once in their lives, concern'd in the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha.</HI> For it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That the obligation does not extend to the poorer &s;ort of people, who have hardly wherewithal to live upon, and would bring great mi&s;ery on their Fami|lies, by their ab&s;ence, as being not able to leave them what is requi&s;ite for their &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>The third Remark is concerning the preference of the two Cities of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and <HI>Medina.</HI> The former is the place of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s birth, which it was his de&s;ign to honour, and make known, by that famous Pilgrimage, whereto he obliges all tho&s;e of his Law. The latter is the place of his Burial, of which there is abun|dance of fabulous relations. <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in his Alcoran, does only enjoyn their going to <HI>Mecha,</HI> where there are no other Relicks of that fal&s;e Prophet, then one of his Sandalls: And the Doctors of the Law are al&s;o of opinion, that there is no obligation of going to <HI>Medina,</HI> and that without &s;eeing that City, a man &s;atisfies the Command of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> I &s;hall treat at large of the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha,</HI> in the la&s;t Chapter of this Relation of my Travels, and of the different Roads by which the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> are conducted to the Tomb of their Prophet.</P>

'Tis an ancient Cu&s;tome, That when the Grand Seignor calls for Water to drink between meals, every time he &s;o calls, co&s;ts him ten <HI>Sequins,</HI> or <HI>Che|quins.</HI> The Ceremony ob&s;erv'd therein is this: In the Chamber call'd the <HI>Haz-Oda,</HI> which is the Appartment of the Forty pages, who are alwayes near the Grand Seignor's per&s;on, there is perpetually one of: them &s;tanding Scentinel at the Entrance, which leads to the Cup-Bearer's Office, where two pages of the &s;ame Quarter are in like manner upon the Scentry.

two foot diameter, and enrich'd with Precious Stones within and without. That is look'd on, as one of the riche&s;t pieces of Plate belonging to the Seraglio. The principal Cup Bearer, who is a white Eunuch, carries it with great Ceremony, attended by a hundred Pages of the <HI>Kilar,</HI> whom he ordinarily has under his Charge, and upheld under the Arms by two of them, who walk on both &s;ides of him.

But when they come to the door of the Chamber, two of the more ancient among them, take the places of the two Pages of the <HI>Kilar,</HI> and compleat the conducting of the <HI>Kilargi-Bachi,</HI> under the Arms, to offer the Cup to the Prince. When he has not any thing to &s;ay to him, he carries it back again into the <HI>Kilar;</HI> but if he will take his op|portunity to entertain him with &s;ome Affair, he delivers the Cup and the Server into the hands of one of the Pages, who led him under the Arms, and he delivers it to tho&s;e, who, belonging to the Cup-Bearer's Office, waited there in expectation of his return.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A way to quench thir&s;t at meals, wholly particular to the <HI>Levantines.</HI></NOTE> 'Tis in the &s;ame place, to wit, that under the over-&s;ight of the Cup-bearer, they keep all &s;orts of refre&s;hing and cooling Waters, as that of Peaches, Cherries, Ra&s;pices, and &s;uch other fruits.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compo&s;ition of <HI>Treacle.</HI></NOTE> It is al&s;o in the Cup-bearers Appartment that the <HI>Treacle</HI> is made, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Tiriak-Farik,</HI> and there is a great quantity of it made, becau&s;e they u&s;e it as an Univer&s;al remedy, and charitably be&s;tow it on all &s;orts of people, as well in City as Country, who are de&s;irous of it. The Vipers which are us'd in this compo&s;ition are brought out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and they make no account of tho&s;e which other Countries afford, or they are of opinion at lea&s;t, that the former are much the better for that purpo&s;e.</P>

There al&s;o are the Lodgings of his Sub&s;titute, the <HI>Kilarquet-houda&s;i,</HI> who is not an Eunuch, as the <HI>Kilargi-bachi</HI> is, and who, at his removal out of the Seraglio, is ordinarily advanc'd to the charge of a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> The <HI>Kilargi-bachi</HI> has in his cu&s;tody all the Gold and Silver-plate, the Ba&s;ins, the Ewers the Bowls, the Cups, the Servers, and the Candle&s;ticks, the greate&s;t part of that &s;ervice being garni&s;h'd with Diamonds, Rubies and Emeralds, and other precious Stones of value. As for golden Di&s;hes and Candle&s;ticks, without any additional embelli&s;hments of precious Stones, there are &s;ome &s;o large, and &s;o ma&s;&s;y, that there mu&s;t be two men to carry one of them. The&s;e Candle&s;ticks are made after a fa&s;hion quite different from ours. They are ordinarily two or three Foot high, upon a Ba&s;e of above twelve inches Diameter, and the upper part thereof is as 'twere a Box or kind of Lamp, with its beak, and it may contain above a pound of &s;uet. 'Tis to prevent the fall of any thing upon the Carpet, that they make the foot of the Candle&s;tick &s;o large as I told you; and be&s;ides, it is requi&s;ite, that it &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion to the height. The match, or wicke, which they put into the Suet, beaten into &s;mall bits, is about the bigne&s;s of a Man's thumb, and con|&s;equently mu&s;t needs make a great light in the Room.

<P>In my di&s;cour&s;e of the Trea&s;ury I made no mention of the Quarter of tho&s;e Officers, who &s;erve there, becau&s;e my de&s;ign was to follow the order of the Struct|ures of the Seraglio, and to conduct the Reader, by little and little, out of one Court into another, and out of one Quarter into another. That of the Pages of the Trea&s;ury, is hard by the <HI>Kilar,</HI> and begins with a Gallery, pav'd with &s;quare pieces of Marble, of different colours, &s;u&s;tain'd by eight Pillars, of the &s;ame mate|rial, and whereof the &s;ides and the roof are painted with all &s;orts of flowers, in Gold and Azure. That Gallery is open on the one &s;ide, and on the other you find in the mid&s;t of it, the Door leading into the Appartment of the Pages, with three great Windows on the right hand, and as many on the left: And 'tis there that the &s;ix mo&s;t elderly Pages of the Trea&s;ury have re&s;idence night and day. From that door, along a walk pav'd with white Marble &s;tones, very large ones, about fifteen paces in length, and five in bredth, you come to another Portal, of the &s;ame material, &s;u&s;tain'd by two Pillars of black Marble; over the &s;aid Portal, there may be read the&s;e words, which are ordinarily enough in the mouths of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and which I have explicated el&s;ewhere;
<Q>La Illahe Illa Alla, Muhammed Re&s;oul Alla.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beds according to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> mode.</NOTE> It gives entrance into a long Hall, where there may be &s;een on both &s;ides a kind of Seat, or Scaffold, a foot and a half in height, and between &s;even or eight in breadth. Every Page has but four foot in breadth for his repo&s;ing place, as well by day, as by night: And for their Beds, they are permitted to have under them, only a Woollen Coverlet, four times doubled, which &s;eryes them for a Quilt, and over that they ordinarily have one of Gold or Silver-Brockado, or &s;ome other &s;umptuous Silk-&s;tuff; and in the Winter time, they are permitted to have three of them. They are not to have their Coverlets all of Wooll, which would be &s;o much the warmer, becau&s;e it would not be a decent &s;ight for the Grand Seignor, when he comes ever and anon, in the night time, pretending indeed as if he would &s;urprize them, and &s;ee how they demean them&s;elves, but in effect, &s;ometimes to cover lewd de&s;igns. 'Tis between tho&s;e Coverlets that the Pages take their repo&s;e, having their Wa&s;t-coat and Drawers on; for there is no talk of any other kind of Linne, either in <HI>Turkey,</HI> or any part of the Ea&s;t; and whether it be Winter or Summer, they alwaies lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep, half clad, with|out any great Ceremony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wayes to &s;atisfie the nece&s;&s;ities of nature dif|ferent from ours.</NOTE> Over the Beds of the Pages, there is a Gallery, which goes quite round the Hall, and is &s;u&s;tain'd by Pillars of Wood, painted all over with red varni&s;h, and there they have their Coffers, wherein their Cloaths are kept. Every one has a Coffer to him&s;elf, but the twelve Senior Pages have each of them two Coffers, and one of tho&s;e twelve has the Key of the Gallery in his cu&s;tody. It is ordinarily open'd but one day in the Week, which is an&s;werable to our <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> and then, every Page goes, and takes out of his Coffer, what he &s;tands in need of. If any one of them mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity look for &s;ome thing there upon any other day, he gets five or &s;ix Pages together, and they all go to the principal Officer of the Trea|&s;ury, and he commands the <HI>Rafgi,</HI> who has the Key of the Gallery in his cu&s;tody, to open it for them, and to have a care that they meddle not with the Coffers of their Companions.</P>
<P>At one of the ends of the Hall, there is a Door, which conducts you to the Fountains, where tho&s;e that have their dependence on the Trea&s;ury go and wa&s;h, when they are call'd to their Devotions. There are &s;even Copper Cocks for that conveniency, and as well the pavement as the Walls, of that place are of white Marble.</P>
<P>The places appointed for the ea&s;ing of Nature are on the right hand, divided into four little Rooms, which are alwas kept very clean, and pav'd with &s;quare pieces of white Marble; as the Room of the Fountain is. The <HI>Turks</HI> do not &s;it down, as we do, when they are in tho&s;e places, but they &s;quat down over the hole,
<PB N="66" REF="307">
which is not half a foot, or little more above the ground. That hole is cover'd with an Iron plate, which ri&s;es and falls by a Spring, and turning one way or other, at the falling of the lea&s;t weight upon it, it comes to the &s;tation it was in before, a&s;&s;oon as the ordure is fallen from it. I have ob&s;erv'd el&s;ewhere, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> and generally all the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> do not u&s;e paper in &s;uch ca&s;es, or upon any undecent occa&s;ion, and when they go to tho&s;e kinds of places, they carry along with them a Pot of water, to wa&s;h them&s;elves withal, and the Iron|plate is al&s;o made clean at the &s;ame time. And &s;o the hole being alwaies cover'd, and the Iron-plate always kept clean there can be no ill &s;mell in the place, and that the rather, for that a &s;mall current of water, which pa&s;&s;es under that place, carries away all the Ordure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;es of the abominable Sin committed by the <HI>Turks</HI> who are con|fin'd within the <HI>Seraglio.</HI></NOTE> But it were to be wi&s;h'd, that they would not &s;o much concern them&s;elves in keeping tho&s;e places &s;o clean, provided they could forbear polluting them with tho&s;e dete&s;table impurities, which I &s;hould gladly have left unmention'd, did I not fear the reproach might be made to me, of my having been defective in point of exactne&s;s. I have already &s;aid &s;omething of it, in the Second Chapter of this Relation, and it is a &s;ubject, which is to be &s;lightely pa&s;t over, that &s;o there may be but imperfect <HI>Idaea's</HI> left of it. It is therefore in tho&s;e places, that the Pages make their nocturnal a&s;&s;ignations, in order to the committing of the wor&s;t of all crimes, which yet they find it very difficult to put in execution, becau&s;e they are &s;o narrowly watch'd; and if they are taken in the very act, they are puni&s;hed with &s;o great &s;everity, that &s;ometimes they are even drubb'd to death; of which cha&s;ti&s;ement, I have el&s;ewhere given an account. In like manner, to prevent the committing of that infamous act, in the places where they take their repo&s;e, there are two Torches lighted, which la&s;t all the Night, and three Eunuchs are ever and anon going their Rounds, by which means the Pages are depriv'd of the oportu|nities, which otherwi&s;e they might have, to offend.</P>
<P>But we need not go far, to find out the Source of this Evil: the &s;trictne&s;s of the re&s;traint they are in, and their being depriv'd of the &s;ight of Women, induce tho&s;e Young Men to practi&s;e &s;uch defilements, and hurry the <HI>Turks</HI> into a Gulph, to which they, by an execrable pa&s;&s;ion, are, naturally but too much inclinable. The <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> who are brought very young into the Seraglio, know not what a Woman is, but by the in&s;tinct of Nature; and there are &s;ome of them, who, for one day's &s;ight and enjoyment of a Woman, would be content to dye the next. All tho&s;e Nations generally have &s;o great a bent to lubricity, that it &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould quit it, but with their lives: what they cannot do one way, they endeavour to do another; and they of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> do all they can to elude the in&s;pection of their Over&s;eers. The <HI>Reader</HI> may call to mind the Action of the two <HI>Pages,</HI> who hid them&s;elves in the <HI>Mo&s;quey,</HI> and that &s;ingle Example is enough, to &s;hew, how they &s;eek out all the ways imaginable, to &s;atisfie their bruti&s;h pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Quarter of the <HI>Ka&s;nadar-bachi,</HI> as al&s;o that of his Companion, or Sub&s;titute, is adjoyning to that of the <HI>Pages</HI> of the Trea&s;ury, and from their Chambers, they have a Pro&s;pect into a little Flower-Garden, which belongs to them. We have yet &s;ome other Chambers to view, before we come to that, which they call the <HI>Haz-Oda,</HI> which is the Appartment of the Forty <HI>Pages</HI> of the Chamber, and the entrance to that of the Grand Seignor.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnificent Chambers.</NOTE> THE <HI>Dogangi-bachi,</HI> or Grand Faulconer, and the Pages, whom he has under his Charge, have their Quarter between that of the Pages of the Trea&s;ury, and that of the Pages of the Chamber. The place appointed for the Pages of the Falconry, has nothing in it extraordinary, and a man cannot make a di&s;covery of any thing of beauty therein: but on the other &s;ide, the two Chambers, where the Grand Falconer Lodges, have &s;omething that's Magnificent and are as &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;h'd, as any other Rom of the Seraglio. The fir&s;t, which &s;erves for an Anti-Chamber, is le&s;&s;er, and they are both of them pav'd with a Checquer-work of black and white Marble, having the Roof beautify'd with Flowers, painted, and guilt. But that of the &s;econd Chamber is the more &s;umptuous by much, as having large Flowers, in embo&s;s'd Work, every Flower in its &s;quare piece, and the Junctures all cover'd with Gold. The Walls are excellently wain&s;coted, wherein al&s;o they have not &s;par'd for Gold, and on both &s;ides, there are cro&s;s-barr'd Windows, whereby the Chamber receives much light. The Marble Chequer-work of the Floor is not &s;een, as being cover'd with a &s;ilken Carpet, upon which there are laid, in &s;everal parts of the Chamber, a certain number of Quilts, two or three Foot in breadth, and about four Inches thick. Some of them are cover'd with Velvet, or Satin, of different Colours; others with Gold-Brockadoes, and every one has its Cu&s;hion of the &s;ame Stuff, between three and four foot in length, and about two foot in heighth. The&s;e Cu&s;hions are laid behind their backs, when they are &s;iting, after their Mode cro&s;s-legg'd, and tho&s;e lettle Quilts are to them, in&s;tead of Chairs, and Couches, in a Chamber</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ordinary Revenues of the Grand Falco|ner.</NOTE> If the Grand Falconer be remov'd out of the Seraglio, it is upon his advance|ment to the Charge of one of the principal <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and to one of the greater Governments, as that of <HI>Cairo,</HI> or <HI>Babylon;</HI> and while he continues in the Seraglio be&s;ides his Table, which is all at the Prince's charge, he is allow'd an annual Revenue, of ten or twelve thou&s;and Crowns. The Pages of the Falconry, carry Hawks on their Fi&s;ts, and feed them: they have the liberty to go and exerci&s;e them in the Gardens, and they all attend the Grand Seignor, when he goes a Hawking, or Hunting. They wear the &s;ame Stuffes, as the Pages
<PB N="68" REF="308">
of the Trea&s;ury, and may al&s;o put on Ve&s;ts of Cloth, but made after &s;uch a fa&s;hion, as makes them ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from the <HI>Ichoglans,</HI> of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Chamber, who are always clad in woollen-cloth. For the Pages of the Falconry have their Sleeves made narrower, and narrower, from the Shoulder to the wri&s;t, and they are there fa&s;ten'd clo&s;e with Buttons; but the Sleeves of the Pages of the Trea&s;ury, are as wide below, as they are above, and that makes the difference between them. The twelve Senior Pages of the Falcoury have the &s;ame &s;laveries and advantages, as the Pages of the Trea|&s;ury, and are their Fellow-Commoners; but the other Companions of the for|mer, are treated after the &s;ame rate as the Pages of the <HI>Seferlis,</HI> who wa&s;h the Grand Seignor's Linnen, and they all common at the &s;ame Table.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Magnifi|cence of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Prin|ces in relation to Hunting and Hawking.</NOTE> Be&s;ides the fore-mentioned Pages, the Grand Faulconer has under his com|mand near eight hundred other per&s;ons, as well in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> as the parts adjacent thereto, perpetually employ'd in the ordering and training up of all &s;orts of Birds for the Game, and there come none into the Seraglio, but what are &s;o or|der'd, and taught. Though there may be a very great number of &s;uch, yet does not the Grand Seignor make u&s;e of any, but what have &s;ome &s;tone of value about the neck, nay &s;ometimes &s;uch as may be valued at ten thou&s;and Crowns. All the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes are very &s;umptuous, in all things re|lating to their Game, and particulary the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Nothing can be imagin'd more Glorious, or Magnificent, than the long Train of the Grandees of his Court, when they return from their Sports. They all march in an excellent order, every one with a Hawke on his Fi&s;t, and every Hawke having about the neck, either a Diamond, or &s;ome other precious &s;tone, of great value, with the hood all embroider'd with Pearles; which mu&s;t needs make a mo&s;t delightful &s;how.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds &s;upplying the place of Dogs, in run|ning down a Deer or Hare.</NOTE> The <HI>Turks,</HI> and other inhabitants of the <HI>Levant,</HI> breed up, in order to their diverti&s;ements, &s;everal &s;orts of Birds, which the <HI>Europaens</HI> make no u&s;e of at all, and they are of a larger &s;ize, and &s;tronger, than ours. With tho&s;e, in&s;tead of Dogs, will they run down a Hare, or a Stagge; and they have al&s;o the diver&s;ion of hunting the Wild Boar, and other &s;avage Bea&s;ts. But what makes that Sport the more delightful is this, that in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Countrey is all open and champion, and there are no Woods, into which the Hawke, or other Bird, might get out of their &s;ight. He di&s;covers the Bea&s;t at a great di&s;tance, fa&s;tens of a &s;uddain upon it, &s;o as that it cannot get loo&s;e from him, and &s;ticking clo&s;e to the Head, picks out the Eyes of it, vexes, and torments it, and retards the &s;wiftne&s;s of its cour&s;e, by which means, the Hunt&s;man come up the &s;ooner to it, and di&s;patch it. But they do not give the fatal blow, till the Prince has order'd them to do it, or till he has &s;hot off an Arrow, or di&s;charg'd his Fire-lock: upon which &s;ignall, they who are about him are permitted to exerci&s;e their courage aud dexterity.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning to the Appartment of the Pages belonging to the Falconry, there is a long Gallery, which is open but of one &s;ide, and in the floor of it, there is a little a&s;cent. It is &s;u&s;tain'd by ten Pillars of Marble, of &s;everal colours, and pav'd with a &s;quare-piec'd work of the &s;ame material; with a Wain&s;cotage, wherein there are &s;ome flowers painted, but very meanly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Seligdar-Aga</HI>'s Cham|ber, who carries the Grand Seig|nor<HI>'s</HI> Sword.</NOTE> From the end of the fore&s;aid Gallery, turning on the right hand you come to the Chamber of the <HI>Selidgar-Aga,</HI> who carries the Sword before the Grand Seignor. Some part of that Chamber is cover'd with Carpets, the other has a Seat or Scaffold, rais'd three foot high, but of a con&s;iderable breadeth to which they a&s;cend by &s;o many &s;teps of white Marble, of four foot in length, the remainder of which Seat, being divided from the Chamber by a Balli&s;ter'd work, partly gilt with Gold, and partly Green. All within that enclo&s;ure of Bal|li&s;ters is cover'd with rich &s;ilken Carpets, and all about, as well to the Wall &s;ide, as to that of the Balli&s;ters, there are &s;umptuous Cu&s;hions of all &s;orts, of Gold and Silver-Brokadoes. The Walls of the Chamber are all gilr, and at equal di&s;tances, there are flower-pots painted, rarely well diver&s;ify'd, and affording a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect. The place where the <HI>Selidgar-Aga</HI> &s;its, is at the corner of that part of the Chamber which is enclos'd with the Bal|li&s;ters, on the right hand, and over his Head hang the Swords and Sabres, which he carries before the Grand Seignor, whithin the Seraglio; and after him, when his Highne&s;s goes out of the Seraglio.</P>

Whenever any piece is taken out, the <HI>Seligdar-Aga,</HI> to whom it is deliver'd, gives the Principal Officer of the Trea|&s;ury an acknowledgment, under his hand, of his having receiv'd it; and by that means nothing can be embezill'd, good order being &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd in all things, relating to the Seraglio. In &s;ome other parts of the Chamber you find hanging up Ponyards and Knives, all rich Pieces, and be&s;et with precious &s;tones, which as all the re&s;t, are exactly Regi&s;tred in the Books of the Trea&s;ury. On each &s;ide of the &s;aid Chamber, there are two little Rooms, for four Pages of the <HI>Seferlis,</HI> who wait on the <HI>Seligdar-Aga,</HI> and are always about his per&s;on.

furni&s;h'd much after the &s;ame rate; but it is not near &s;o light&s;ome, or rather, it wants light.

<P>As &s;oon as you are come into the Chamber, you find on the right hand &s;everal words of the Law, written, and enchac'd, in guilt &s;quares, and one of the&s;e Writings is, of Sultan <HI>Achmet's,</HI> the Father of <HI>Amurath.</HI> On the left hand, you <NOTE PLACE="marg">A noble Monu|ment of <HI>Amu|rath's</HI> Valour.</NOTE>find, fa&s;ten'd to the Wall, a Coat of Mail, a Head-piece, and a great Buckler; it is one of the Monuments of <HI>Amurath</HI>'s Valour. During the Siege of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> coming out of the City, and challenging any one of the Be&s;iegers to meet him, that Prince, one of the mo&s;t courageous and &s;tronge&s;t men of his age, would needs receive him him&s;elf, without any other Arms, than a Sabre in his hand, though the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> was arm'd from head to foot. <HI>Amurath</HI> who was not only a pro|digious Per&s;on as to &s;trength, and valour, but al&s;o well skill'd in the u&s;e of a Wea|pon, afforded him not the time to con&s;ider whom he had to deal withal, but im|mediately gave him &s;uch a furious blow with the Sabre, over the right &s;houlder, that he cut his coat of Mail quite to the Middle of his Body, and left him dead upon the place.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Haz-Oda,</HI> or the Chamber of the forty Pages, there is a Gallery of a con&s;iderable length, and particularly remarkable for its Structure. It is open on both &s;ides, and has, of each, a row of white Marble-Pillars; but it is built after the Serpentine fa&s;hion, and they who walk in it are, every &s;ix paces, out of &s;ight one of the other. There are, under this Gallery four great Pre&s;tes, to put up the accouttements of the four Officers, who are always about the Grand Seignor's Per|&s;on, to wit, the <HI>Seligdar-Aga,</HI> the <HI>Chokadar-Aga,</HI> the <HI>Requabdar-Aga,</HI> and the <HI>Hazoda|bacht,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken at the beginning of this Relation, when I gave a Li&s;t of the Grandees of the Port.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;cituation of the Mo&s;ques in <HI>Turkey,</HI></NOTE> This Gallery, of &s;o fanta&s;tick and &s;o extraordinary a Structre, is not far from that other, which is a continu'd a&s;cent, and whereof I made mention in the prece|dent Chapter. Oppo&s;ite to this la&s;t, there is a Mo&s;quey of the middle &s;ort, as to the largene&s;s, the length of it &s;omewhat exceeding its breadth, and it &s;tands North and South, a &s;ituation the <HI>Turks</HI> ob&s;erve in all their Mo&s;queys, which are always turn'd towards <HI>Meeha,</HI> which place is Meridional to all the provinces of the Empire.

On both &s;ides of the &s;aid Neech, there is a Gallery &s;u&s;tain'd by five Pillars, &s;ome whereof are of green Marble, and the re&s;t of Prophyry. And in the Mo&s;|quey, and in the Chamber, or Room, into which the Grand Seignor comes-to do his Devotions, and in the two Galleries, there's no going but upon rich Carpets. You are not to look for ought of Painting there; nor have the Walls any other Ornament, then that of the whitene&s;s of the Marble, whereof they are built. But there are a great many Writings, in large <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters, enchac'd in gilt Borders, hanging up in &s;everal places, and tho&s;e Writings contain only things taken out of the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The Window of the Chamber into which the Grand Seignor comes to do his Devotions, is &s;ix foot in length, and three foot high, and has a Lattice with

a Curtain behind it, as it is in &s;everal Chappels, which our Chri&s;tiau Princes have in their Palaces. There is al&s;o oppo&s;ite to the &s;ame Neech, before-mention'd, &s;uch another Window, and &s;uch another Chamber, for the Sultane&s;&s;es, and when the <HI>Muezim,</HI> who&s;e &s;tation is of one &s;ide of the <HI>Iman,</HI> and who is as it were his Clerk, hears the drawing of the Curtains, he immediately rings a &s;mall Bell which is the &s;ignal, that the Grand Seignor and the Sultane&s;&s;es are come into their &s;everal Rooms.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the Domo of the Mo&s;quey, there is a Hoop of Iron, all about which there hangs a great number of Lamps, of <HI>Venice</HI>-Cry&s;tal, and there are al&s;o &s;ome di&s;pos'd along the Galleries, of the &s;ame Metal, they being not permitted to have in ther Mo&s;queys, either Gold or Silver. They do not light tho&s;e Lamps, but only for the Prayers at night, and the fire ca&s;ting a reflection one tho&s;e Cry&s;tals, creates a mo&s;t delighful Object to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Chamber of the <HI>Sarai-Aga&s;i,</HI> one of the four Principal Eunuchs, is adjoyning to that Mo&s;quey, and the lea&s;t of all the Chambers, of the Officers, belonging to the Inner-part of the Seraglio. He has but little place more than is requi&s;ite for him to &s;leep in, and he is waited on by two Pages of the <HI>Couchouk-Oda,</HI> or the little Chamber</P>
<P>Adjoyning to the Door of the <HI>Haz-Oda,</HI> there is a Hall pav'd with a Checquer-work of black and white Marble, in the mid&s;t whereof there is a Ba&s;in of the &s;ame material, but of &s;everal Colours, out of which there is an a&s;cent of water four or five foot high. That water is receiv'd into a &s;econd Ba&s;in, made in the form of a Scallop-&s;hell, out of which it falls again into a third, much larger than the two precedent ones. The upper part of the Hall is built Domo-wi&s;e, having therein &s;ome Windows, which give it light, and a certain piece of dull Painting is all the Ornament of its Walls. At your entrance into this Hall, you &s;ee two Doors, one on the right hand, the other on the left. That on the left hand conducts to a Flower-Garden? and the other is the door of a Chamber, into which the Grand Seignor comes &s;ometimes in the Winter-Sea&s;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A magnificent Winter Cham|ber.</NOTE> This Chamber is one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous of any in the Seraglio. It's Arched Roof is divided into a great number of little Cells, Triangle-wi&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by two little filets of Gold with a green &s;treak in the mid&s;t, and out of every Angle, there jurs &s;omewhat like the bottom of Lamp, excellently well gilt. Though the Walls are of a curious white Marble, yet is there a delicate piece of Wain&s;cotage, of about the height of a man's wa&s;te, carried quite round the Room, and the rich Carpets, upon which you walk, deprive your &s;ight of the large &s;quares of Marble, of &s;everal colours, wherewith the Floor is embelli&s;h'd. Of a great number of Cu&s;hions, which are placed along the Walls, &s;ome are embroider'd with Pearls, and precious Stones, and &s;et there only for o&s;tentation; the others, which are for &s;ervice, are cover'd with Gold, or Silver-Brokadoes, and other co&s;tly Stuffs. At one of the corners of the Chamber, there is a little Field-bed, about two foot in heighth, embroider'd all over, the Counterpane, the Cu&s;hions, and the Quilt; and that Embroidery is all of Pearles, Rubies, and Emeralds. But when the Grand Seignor is to come into that Chamber, they take away the Counterpane and Cu&s;hions, which are le&s;s fit for Service than for Ornament, and they bring in others of quilted or tufted Velvet, or Satin, upon which the Grand Seignor may more conveniently repo&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet's</HI> My&s;terious Seal.</NOTE> Towards the feet of the &s;aid Bed, there is a kind of Neech made within the very Wall, in which there is a little Ebony Box, about half a foot &s;quare, and in that is lock'd up <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Seal. It is enchac'd in a Cry&s;tal, with a Bordure of Ivory, and taking all together, it may be four inches in length, and three in breadth. I have &s;een the Impre&s;&s;ion of it upon a piece of Paper

but he who &s;hew'd it me, would not &s;uffer me to touch it, only upon this &s;core, that he look'd on it as a great Relick. Once in three months this Chamber is made clean, and the Carpets are chang'd, the Pages of the Trea|&s;ury being employ'd in that Office. And then it is, that the <HI>Cha&s;nader-bacht</HI> opens the Box, and having in his hands an embroider'd Hand-kerchief, he takes out the Seal, with great re&s;pect and reverence, whil&s;t the Seignor of the Pages holds a golden Cup, garni&s;h'd with Diamonds and blue Saphris, on the top of which there is a kind of Perfuming-Pot, out of which there comes an ex|halation of all &s;orts of &s;weet Scents, whereby the whole Room is in a maner embalm'd. The Page holds that in both his hands joyn'd together, and lifting it up higher than his Head, all tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent immediately pro&s;trate them&s;elves to the ground, as an acknowledgment of their veneration. As &s;oon as they are up again, the Page brings down the Cup, lower than his chin, and the principal Officer of the Trea&s;ury, holding the Seal over the &s;moake, all tho&s;e who are in the Room, come and ki&s;s the Chry&s;tal which covers one of the mo&s;t precious Relicks, that they have of their Prophet. I have us'd all the endeavours I could, to get out of my two Officers of the Trea|&s;ury, who had often ki&s;s'd that Chry&s;tal, what Ob&s;ervations they might have made, as to the material whereof the Seal was made and what Letters were engrav'd upon it; but they told me, that by the rea&s;on of the &s;moke, and the Chyr&s;tal, which covers the Seal, not to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;mall time they have to ob&s;erve it, during the act of ki&s;&s;ing it, it is not po&s;&s;ible that any one can give a certain judgment of either the Stuff, or the Engraving of it.</P>
<P>Upon the fourteenth day of the <HI>Ramazan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Lent of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Grand Seignor comes in per&s;on into that Chamber, accompany'd only by the <HI>Seligdar-Aga,</HI> and taking off the Chry&s;tal, which lies over the Seal, he delivers it into his hands, ordering him to make the Impre&s;&s;ion of it upon fifty little bits of Paper, which are not much bigger than the Seal it &s;elf. This Impre&s;&s;ion is taken off with a certain gummy Ink, which is pre|par'd in a Pourcelain Di&s;h, whereinto he thru&s;ts his finger, and rubs the Seal with it, and keeps all tho&s;e Printed Papers, for the u&s;e, to which his Highne&s;s de&s;igns them, as we &s;hall &s;ee, e're we come to the end of this Chapter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Su|per&s;tition of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> Within the &s;ame Chamber, and adjoyning to the place, where the Seal is kept, there is another Box or Coffer, of a larger &s;ize, cover'd with a Carpet of green Velvet, with a great fringe of Gold and Silver, wherein is kept, <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s <HI>Hirka.</HI> It is a Garment with large &s;leves of a white Camlet, made of Goat's hair, which the <HI>Turks</HI> do al&s;o look upon as a great Relick. The Grand Seignor having taken it out of the Coffer, ki&s;&s;es it with much re|&s;pect, and puts it into the hands of the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> who is come into the Room by his Order, after they had taken the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Seal. The Officer &s;ends to the Over&s;eer of the Trea&s;ury, for a large golden Caul|dron, which is brought in thither by &s;ome of the Seignor-Pages. It is &s;o capacious, according to the de&s;cription which they gave me of it, as to contain the &s;ixth part of a Tun, and the out-&s;ide of it is garni&s;h'd, in &s;ome places, with Emeralds, and Turquezes. This Ve&s;&s;el is fill'd with water with|in &s;ix &s;ingers breadth of the brink, and the <HI>Capi-Aga,</HI> having put <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Garment into it, and left it to &s;oak a little while, takes it out again, and wrings it hard, to get out the water it had imbib'd, which falls into the Cauldron, taking great care, that there falls not any of it to the ground. That done, with the &s;aid water he fills a great number of <HI>Venice</HI>-Chyr&s;tal Bottles, containing about half a pint, and when he has &s;topp'd them, he Seals them with the Grand Seignor's Seal.

<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, That the <HI>Capi-Aga</HI> is allow'd to multiply the &s;aid Water, as far as he thinks requi&s;ite, and an&s;werably to his de&s;ire of multi|plying the Pre&s;ents. All he has to do, is only to fill up the Cauldron, as it is emptied, and that additional water is as good as 'twas before, &s;ince it is intermix'd with that wherein <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Garment had been &s;oak'd. For there are many per&s;ons, to whome he &s;ends tho&s;e Bottles, with out the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the Seal, upon the little piece of paper, and he has a &s;nack out of all that is be&s;tow'd on the Bearers of tho&s;e Pre&s;ents. But he is not per|mitted to make that multiplication of the Water, any longer than for the &s;pace of three days; that is to &s;ay, till the Seventeenth of the <HI>Ramazan,</HI> after which time, the additional intermixture of it would not have the Vertue, which they imagine it has,</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignor's Bed-Chamber.</NOTE> From that door of the Hall, which gives entrance into the Flower-garden, you pa&s;s, on the right hand, into a kind of Gallery, about fifty paces in length, and twelve in breadth, the pavement whereof is a Chequer-work of Black and White Marble, at the end of it there is a great Structure, which is wholly of Marble, and what fir&s;t entertains the Eye is a pretty lage Door, over which there is a kind of a flat arched Roof. And both the Roof, and the Door, are adorn'd with flowers in embo&s;s'd work; and among&s;t tho&s;e flowers, there are certain impre&s;&s;es cut in the Marble, and all curiou&s;ly Gilt.</P>
<P>About five or &s;ix paces from that Door, you come to another not inferiour to it, as to beauty, which is that of the Grand Seignor's own Chamber. Its Cieling, or arched Roof, is according to the model of the Winter-room, whereof I have given you a De&s;cription at the beginning of this Chapter. The only difference between 'em is, in what i&s;&s;ues out of the Angles of the little Arches; and whereas in the other Room they repre&s;ent the bottoms of Lamps, gilt with Gold; in this, they are balls of Rock-Cry&s;tal, cut Facet-wi&s;e, with an inter-mixture of precious &s;tones, of different Colours, which mu&s;t needs give a very divertive entertainment to the Eye. The Floor of it is cover'd with Carpets, which, as to Beauty and Excellency of Workman&s;hip, exceed tho&s;e of the other Chambers; and the &s;ame thing is to be &s;aid, as to the Quilts, the Counterpanes, and the Cu&s;hions; the mo&s;t part of this Furniture being adorn'd with an Embroidery of Pearls, and the whole Room which is very &s;pacious, having in all parts, &s;everal other &s;umptuous embelli&s;h|ments. And whereas this Room was Originally de&s;ign'd for the Grand Seignor's Summer-Diverti&s;ement, it is accordingly the more light&s;ome, and has large Windows on three &s;ides of it. As to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Lodging, he complies with the cu&s;tome of the Countrey, or rather that of all the Ea&s;tern parts. There is no Bed|&s;tead &s;et up, but towards the Evening the Pages &s;pread three Quilts one upon the other, at one of the corners of the Chamber, and place over it a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, garni&s;h'd with an embroidery of Pearls.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A word further of the Prince's Appartment.</NOTE> Out of the Grand Seignor's Chamber, there is a pa&s;&s;age into a great Hall, the place appointed for the Reception of the Pages who approach his Per&s;on; and there is adjoyning to it a Bath, which is fill'd by three Cocks, where they wa&s;h them&s;elves, when they go to their Devotions. Out of the &s;ame Hall, there is an a&s;cent of &s;ome &s;teps, which brings you to a &s;mall Clo&s;et, only Wain&s;coted about, but well Painted, and well Gilt.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inclinations common to the Ea&s;tern Mo|narchs.</NOTE> THE <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchs, and generally all the Princes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> what Repu|tation &s;oever they may have gain'd, for their Valour, have always been guilty of a bent to Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and Effeminacy, and found great Charms in a &s;lothful kind of Life. They come out of their Seraglio's as &s;eldome as they can, and that only, when an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity forces them to &s;hew them&s;elves in publick, whether it be at the head of their Armies, or in tho&s;e Ceremonies, wherein the Law, or common Civilities, require their Pre&s;ence. True it is, that &s;ome of them were not &s;o great Lovers of Retirement as others, and preferr'd the hard&s;hips of War, the Diverti&s;ements of Hunting, before the blandi&s;hments of Ea&s;e, and the conver&s;ation of Women: But tho&s;e may be re|duced into a very &s;mall number, and the greate&s;t part of them being more addicted to mind their quiet, and to lead a Life void of di&s;turbance, have tran&s;|ferr'd all their concerns, Civil and Military, to the management of the principal Mini&s;ter of State, thinking it enough to content them&s;elves with the account he was pleas'd to give him thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Seraglio</HI> a place delicious to one fingle per&s;on, and in|commodious to many.</NOTE> It may be &s;aid of the Seraglio, That it is a delicate, but withal a &s;olitary place of abode: but as to the Ob&s;ervations <HI>I</HI> have made of things, it is delicious only to a &s;ingle per&s;on, and &s;olitary to all the re&s;t. Of the many Thou&s;ands, of the Male Sex, who are there as 'twere in Pri&s;on, and have a dependence, one upon the other, none but the Prince him&s;elf has the &s;ight of Women; for the Negro-Eunuchs, whom their deformity of Body and Countenance has, in a manner, transform'd into Mon&s;ters, are not to be admitted into the number of Men.</P>

<PB N="78" REF="313">
recommendable in them, that their great pur&s;uance of plea&s;ures does not ever make them neglect the Divine Wor&s;hip, and that, &s;etting all things a&s;ide, they are careful to perform what the Law requires of them, upon that acccount. They are exact and punctual, even to &s;uper&s;tition, in all their exerci&s;es of Piety, in their ways of wa&s;hing them&s;elves, in their Prayers, in their Fa&s;ts, in their Alms, and in their Pilgrimages; which are the Five principal Articles of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The regulated times of their Devotions.</NOTE> It is a thing &s;ufficiently well known to all people, that the <HI>Turks</HI> go to their Pray|ers, or Devotions, five times a day, that is, in the &s;pace of a natural Day, which amounts to four and twenty hours. For the performance of this work, there are no certain hours appointed, and it is according to the Sun's being above the Horizon. Upon which account, there is a greater interval between their &s;everal Offices, in the Summer-time, than there is in the Winter, and they place the principal part of their Devotion upon ob&s;ervations of that nature. The fir&s;t exerci&s;e is to be perform'd at the break of day, before Sun-ri&s;ing; the &s;econd at Noon; the third, between that time and Sun-&s;et; the fourth, immediately after his &s;etting; and the la&s;t, about an hour and an half after Night: in all which, unle&s;s &s;ickne&s;s intervene, they are very punctual, &s;o that nothing of bu&s;ine&s;s, how important &s;oever, &s;hall divert them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fervour in Acts of De|votion.</NOTE> Nay, on the contrary, &s;ome are &s;o zealous, and their fervour is &s;o remarkable, that being once fixt in their Prayers, they could not be put out of them, though 'twere to force back an Enemy, who were entering into the City, or that word &s;hould be brought them, that the hou&s;e wherein they are, was on fire. They are moreover of a per&s;wa&s;ion, that it is a great &s;in, for them to put their hand to any part of the body, to &s;cratch&punc; them&s;elves, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion; and they would have the external part to be an&s;werable to the internal, and corre&s;pondent to that abjection, which ought to be the &s;tate of the Soul, in the pre&s;ence of God, during their Exerci&s;es of Devotion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignors ordi|nary Employ|ments.</NOTE> Nor does the Grand Seignor him&s;elf de&s;ire to be di&s;pens'd from the obligation of performing the&s;e acts of Devotion, any more than the meane&s;t of his Subjects; but, on the contrary, he is very religious in that ob&s;ervance of their Law, and he always begins the day with the Offices appointed for that part of it. We need &s;ay no more, than that he ri&s;es at the break of day, nay &s;ometimes he is up before, and goes into the Bath to wa&s;h him&s;elf, e&s;pecially when he has lain with one of his Wives, or Concubines. Having fini&s;h'd his Prayers, he diverts him&s;elf in &s;hooting with the Bowe, or more commonly in looking after his Hor&s;es, and riding &s;ome of them: and &s;ometimes he &s;ets him&s;ef in a Gallery, where he cannot be &s;een by any, and contents him&s;elf with the diver&s;ion of &s;eeing &s;ome exerci&s;es perform'd by his Pages. If an one of them does &s;omething that he is much pleas'd withal, he &s;ends him a Ve&s;t, or &s;ome other thing of value, as an encouragement for his doing better another time, and to rai&s;e an emulation in his Companions. Upon Council-days, he comes through the clo&s;e Gallery, to the Window, which looks into the <HI>Divan</HI> Hall, to &s;ee what they are doing there: and upon the ri&s;ing of the Council, he returns to his own Quarter, where his Dinner is brought up to him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Services of his Table.</NOTE> In the &s;ervices of his Table, there is not any great varitey, or delicacy, the Di&s;h|es that are &s;erv'd up, being an&s;werable to the Bill of fare, wich I have given you in the Chapter, where I treat of the Kitchins. He takes his refection, &s;itting, cro&s;s-leg'd, as Taylors do among&s;t us, being &s;urrounded with &s;umptuous Bro|cado-cu&s;hions, which keep from him the dampne&s;s of the Walls, and upon the Carpets which cover the Scaffold, or Balcony, where he is &s;eated, they &s;pread others of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Leather, le&s;t the former &s;hould be prejudic'd by any thing of grea&s;i|ne&s;s, which might fall on the Table-cloath, and &s;oak through it. This Cloath, which is laid over the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Leather-Carpet, is of tho&s;e &s;umptuous painted Cloaths, which are made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and embroider'd all about: and as for Napkins, there are not any u&s;ed among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are near, and cleanly at their Meals, and if &s;ometimes there be any occa&s;ion of wiping, 'tis done with a little hand|kerchief. At their refections, they u&s;e the right hand only, and when they have done, there is a Ba&s;in of warm water and &s;oap brought up, for them to wa&s;h, and every one takes out his Handkerchief from under his Sa&s;ch, or Girdle, to wipe his hands and mouth. Nor mu&s;t you expect in <HI>Turkey</HI> to find Knives and
<PB N="79" REF="313">
Forks laid on the Table, but every one has his Knife lodg'd in his Sa&s;ch, and makes u&s;e of, when occa&s;ion requires: but they have no great u&s;e for them, in|a&s;much as their Bread being made thin, as 'twere into Cakes, and eaten in a man|ner as &s;oon as 'tis out of the Oven they break it with their fingers, and all the meat, which is &s;erv'd up to them, is cut into &s;mall pieces, which is al&s;o the cu&s;tome in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But the Spoons they u&s;e, in taking their Pottages, and whatever is liquid upon the Table, are much larger than ours; and they are wooden ones. The Pages of the <HI>Kilar,</HI> that is the Cup-bearers Office bring up the Bread, and the Sher|bets, and the Pages of the Chamber go and take the meat, at the Prince's Appart|ment, out of the hands of the Officers belonging to the Kitchin, who bring it in Di&s;hes cover'd with Pourcelain, the Grand Seignor not u&s;ing any Gold Ve&s;&s;els at his own Table.</P>
<P>After Dinner, the Grand Seignor &s;ays his Noon-Prayer, and &s;ometimes, on <HI>Sundays</HI> and <HI>Tue&s;days,</HI> which are the principal Council-days he comes into the Hall of Audience, to di&s;cour&s;e with his Mini&s;ters of State, concerning his Affairs. On the other days, he walks in the Gardens of the Seraglio, &s;ometimes with his <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> &s;ometimes with the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> or with the <HI>Dwarfs</HI> and <HI>Mutes,</HI> who &s;hew a thou&s;and api&s;h tricks, to divert him: and &s;ometimes he goes a hunting, or fi&s;h|ing, according to his inclination. But neither his Affairs, nor his Recreations do ever divert him from performing the five Exerci&s;es of Devotion, at the times appointed by the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> and it is the general Per&s;wa&s;ion of all the <HI>Turks,</HI> that if they neglect them, they bring down God's cur&s;e upon them&s;elves, and that they cannot avoid the ill con&s;equences thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sultan,</HI> when obliged to go, in Cere|mony, to the Mo&s;quey.</NOTE> I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere, that <HI>Friday</HI> is to the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> what the <HI>Saturday</HI> is to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Sunday</HI> to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> in regard it was upon the &s;aid day, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> took his flight from <HI>Mecha;</HI> and I have al&s;o given this further intimation, that the <HI>Turks</HI> count their Months only by the number of the Moons. There is an ancient Cu&s;tome, whereby the Grand Seignor is obliged upon all the fir&s;t <HI>Frydays</HI> of the &s;everal Moons, to go to the new Mo&s;quey, in regard that S. <HI>Sophia</HI> is too near the Seraglio, and be&s;ides that there is not, between tho&s;e places, room enough for &s;o great a Train, as that of the Sultan, the people of <HI>Can&s;tantinople</HI> would not have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>His Devotion is &s;o great, that he &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es that Ceremony, and when there pa&s;&s;es a fir&s;t <HI>Fryday</HI> of the month, without his appearance in it, the people is pre&s;ently of opinion, that he is &s;ick and thereupon turbulunt &s;pirits are mutining their factious de&s;igns. On tho&s;e dayes do they, who have any complaints to make, of &s;ome inju&s;tice that has been done them, take their opportunity and plant them&s;elves in the way through which he is to pa&s;s, with Petitions in their hands, which upon a &s;ign made by the Sultan, are receiv'd by Eunuchs. If the inju&s;tice be very great and the per&s;on who pre&s;ents the Petition be extreamly oppre&s;s'd and injur'd, he holds a lighted Torch over his head, which is ordinari|ly practis'd in <HI>Turkey</HI> upon the like occa&s;ions, and by that my&s;terious comportment, intimates to the Prince; That if he does not do him ju&s;tice, his Soul &s;hall burn in the other World, as that Torch does in this.</P>
<P>Upon the Emperour's going out of the Seraglio, the principal <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> his Mother, his deare&s;t Con&s;ort, or his Si&s;ters, are in a Room over the great Gate of that Palace, with Bags full of <HI>A&s;pers,</HI> which they fling among the people, that they may pray, That God would graciou&s;ly hearken to the Devotions, which the Grand Seignor is going to perform. His March is after the &s;ame Order, and with an ob&s;ervance of the Pomp, as that of the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours, and I que&s;tion not, but that tho&s;e Authors, who have written of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire in general, or particularly of the City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> have made &s;ufficient de|&s;criptions, of that Ceremony, and therefore I &s;hall think my &s;elf di&s;pens'd from the obligations of giving a new one of it. I &s;hall only &s;ay this of it, That it is very Magnificent, and that there is not any Monarch in the World, who makes &s;o great an expo&s;al of Gold and precious Stones together, wherewith the Har|ne&s;&s;es and Trappings of mo&s;t of the Hor&s;es, as well of the <HI>Grand Seignor,</HI> as tho&s;e of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's</HI> are all cover'd.</P>

Upon this Exhortation, the Sultan orders twenty or thirty Pur&s;es to be di&s;tributed among&s;t them; nay &s;ometimes his Charity is &s;o great, as to amount to twenty thou&s;and Crowns, which are receiv'd by the <HI>Moufti,</HI> and the di&s;tribution thereof is made, as he plea&s;es. But the greater part of it he converts to his own u&s;e, and holds an infamous Corre&s;pondence with mo&s;t of that wretched Crew, who though they often pre&s;ent them&s;elves for that Benevolence, he pretends not to have any knowledge of at all.

He has al&s;o a third Brother, named <HI>Solyman,</HI> who is the &s;econd of the Sons of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> according to the order of their Nativities. But the Mother of the la&s;t mentioned Son is dead; and thence it comes, that the Souldiery, who con|ceive greater hopes of that Prince, than of either <HI>Bajazet,</HI> or <HI>Orchan,</HI> his Brethren, pity him the more, and have the greater Affection for him, upon that very &s;core of his having lo&s;t the &s;upport, which he might have expected from a Mother.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Bajazet</HI> the Second, who fir&s;t introduc'd that inhumane and cruel Cu&s;tome, of &s;ecuring the Throne of the Sultan-Regent, by the death of his Brethren, few of tho&s;e unfortunate Princes have e&s;cap'd the Barbari&s;m of their Elder-Brother, and they, among&s;t them, who have been treated with &s;ome|what le&s;s of inhumanity, have pin'd away their Lives in a &s;trict and doleful Im|pri&s;onment, being not permitted to &s;ee any body. This was the Treatment of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> the Father of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Amurath,</HI> his Brother, the Son of <HI>Achmet,</HI> by <HI>Kio&s;em,</HI> a Woman of Excellent Parts, and well vers'd in the Manage|ment of Affairs. <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Brothers are now treated after the &s;ame rate, and the Mother of <HI>Bajazet,</HI> and <HI>Orchan,</HI> u&s;es all the endeavours &s;he can, to &s;ecure to them the Affections of the great Officers of the Port, and the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ted with the capricious humour, and extraordinary Covetou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> This Prince was advanc'd to the Throne in the Year 1650. after the Death of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> his Father, who was &s;trangled by the <HI>Janizaries</HI> in a Sedition. He being then but Seven Years of Age, the Regency was be&s;towed, during his Minority, on the Old Sultane&s;s, Mother to <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who &s;oon after abus'd her Authority, and rai&s;ed a dangerous Faction again&s;t her Grand-Child <HI>Mahomet,</HI> wherein &s;he lo&s;t her Life.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pourtrai|ture of <HI>Maho|met IV.</HI> the pre&s;ent Prince.</NOTE> The Grand Seignor <HI>Mahomet</HI> is hand&s;ome enough as to his Per&s;on, his Stature &s;omewhat exceeding that of the middle &s;ort of per&s;ons; he has not too much cor|pulency, and his health is in an uncertain &s;tate. He is very much troubled with a Fall, which he receiv'd in the violence of his Game, &s;ome years &s;ince, by leaping his Hor&s;e over a broad Ditch: And whereas that pa&s;&s;ion is &s;till predominant in him, this inconvenience attends it, That, when he is not &s;omewhat favourable and indulgent to him&s;elf, in that violent Exerci&s;e, he is &s;ometimes taken off his Hor&s;e in a mi&s;erable condition, the Remedies which might be apply'd to that indi&s;po&s;ition, taking no effect, by rea&s;on of the little care he takes to pre&s;erve him&s;elf. He is a per&s;on of an uncon&s;tant and unquiet di&s;po&s;ition, which creates the greater trouble to tho&s;e who wait on him; and though they &s;tudy his humours, yet is it a hard matter to &s;atisfie him. He has a Son, who has been Circumcis'd with great Solemnity, at the Age, wherein that Ceremony is to be perform'd. The Sultane&s;s, his Mother, a Woman of a Magnificent humour, to augment the Pomp and Splendour of that Action, to the Eyes as well of the <HI>Turks</HI> as Forreiners, would have the Garment, which the Young Prince wore that day, to be all cover'd with Diamonds, and, to that end, caus'd &s;everal Rich Piece, of the Trea|&s;ury to be broken; but after the Solemnity, all the Precious Stones were carried back into it again.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> &s;aid erewhile, that the pre&s;ent Sultan-<HI>Mahomet</HI> is extreamly addicted to Hunting, and makes it &s;o much his Darling Diverti&s;ement, that he makes le&s;s account of the Lives of Men, than he does of his Dogs; and withal, that he is of a very Covetous Humour. <HI>I</HI> &s;hall, in one &s;ingle Example make a &s;ufficient di&s;covery of both tho&s;e inclinations in him, and that will al&s;o further make it appear, how well he was skill'd, in that Knack of exerci&s;ing great Liberalities, without any deduction out of his Revenues.</P>
<P>When the Grand Seignor goes a Hunting, there are Orders &s;ent to a great number of People, for the &s;pace of four or five Leagues about the place where he intends to Hunt, in order to the &s;urrounding of a certain quantity of Ground, and for the enclo&s;ing of it &s;o well, as that nothing can e&s;cape thence. 'Tis not to be imagin'd, this can be done, without great de&s;truction to the Countrey, and much inconvenience to the poor People, who are forc'd to leave their Work, to carry on an Exerci&s;e which is much more toil&s;ome than it, in which they many times come off with the Lo&s;s of Limb, or Life, or &s;ome other di&s;a&s;trous Accident. The&s;e continual impo&s;itions of trouble and toil, put many People into the repining humour, in&s;omuch that an Eunuch, who was in favour, having one day, taken the free|dom to repre&s;ent to the Grand Seignor the prejudice his Subjects underwent, by tho&s;e cour&s;es which occa&s;ion'd the &s;poyling of their Grounds, and the lo&s;s of their Lives, he grew very Angry, and after &s;ome days Impri&s;onment, he gave him a &s;hameful Ejection out of the Seraglio.</P>
<P>But, in proce&s;s of Time, the mi&s;chievous Inconveniences occa&s;ion'd by this in|&s;atiable pur&s;uance of his Plea&s;ures in Hunting, increa&s;ing more and more, the Grand Vizir, and the other Ba&s;&s;a's, re&s;olv'd to intreat the <HI>Moufti,</HI> to make a Re|mon&s;trance to him, of the ill con&s;equence thereof, he being the only Per&s;on who might pre&s;ume to &s;peak any more of it to the Grand Seignor. The <HI>Moufti</HI> would by no means hearken to it at fir&s;t, imagining, as he might well, that his Ha|rangue would not be plea&s;ing to the Sultan: But, at la&s;t, being over-per&s;waded to do that good office to the Publick, he took Courage, and his opportunity, to &s;peak to him, with all the in&s;inuation he could.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ancient Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Greek</HI> Empe|rours, to live by their handy|work.</NOTE> He could not bethink him&s;elf of a better Expedient, to remove that predominant pa&s;&s;ion out of his mind, than to repre&s;ent to him, the Cu&s;tom of his Predece&s;&s;ors, who took their diver&s;ion in &s;ome handy-work, when the War, or the Concerns of State gave them any remi&s;&s;ion: That, according to their Example, their Sub|jects apply'd them&s;elves to things that were beneficial, and made all Arts and Profe&s;&s;ions to flouri&s;h in the Empire, to the great Advantage of the Publick: That Sultan <HI>Amurath</HI> his Uncle, delighted in making tho&s;e Horn-Rings, which are us'd in &s;hooting with the Long-Bowe: That <HI>Ibrahim</HI> his Father, was an Excellent

<P>He further Remon&s;trated to his Highne&s;s. That it was much more commen|dable in the &s;ight of men, and more acceptable to God, for him to live by the Labour of his hands, than by the &s;weat of the People, and the Money ari&s;ing by Impo&s;itions, which were forbidden by the Law: and that what was allotted for the peculiar Diet of his Predece&s;&s;ors, was the product of their own handy work: That true it was indeed, they were not oblig'd to any a&s;&s;iduity in the Employments they had fancied, but that what they did was as much for their own diver&s;ion, as to &s;atisfie the Precept of the Law; and when they had fini&s;h'd &s;ome piece of Work, they &s;ent it to &s;ome Ba&s;&s;a, for whom they had a particular kindne&s;s, and he receiv'd it with extraordinary re&s;pect, and abundance of joy: That he, who was the Bearer of it, when he came to pre&s;ent it, &s;aid, That Piece of Work, was made by the Grand Seignor him&s;elf, who had &s;ent him to Sell it, in order to his own &s;u&s;tenance: And that the Ba&s;&s;a, or other Per&s;on, to whom it was directed, to expre&s;s how highly he was pleas'd therewith, gave him a certain number of Pur&s;es for it; not accounting the Pre&s;ent which was to be made to the Bearer: That what Money came in that way, was de&s;ign'd to bear the Charges of the Prince's own Table, and by that means, he could not be charg'd with living by the Labour of his Subjects.</P>
<P>To this effect was the <HI>Moufti</HI>'s harangue; and I &s;hall tell you by the way, That the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> have the &s;ame Cu&s;tome, or rather the &s;ame Super&s;tition. I in the Reign of <HI>Shach-Abas,</HI> there were built, at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> certain Places called <HI>Caravan&s;eras,</HI> which are publick hou&s;es, where the Merchants are lodg'd, the Rents whereof are &s;et a&s;ide for the maintenance of the King's own Table; the Money which is rais'd by the Cu&s;toms, and other Impo&s;itions, being accounted as to that &s;core, for <HI>Haram,</HI> that is to &s;ay, for <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>forbidden,</HI> and re&s;erv'd to be employed in the Exigencies of State, and not for the Su&s;tenance of the Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sultan</HI> is cunningly re|venged of the <HI>Moufti.</HI></NOTE> The Grand Seignor di&s;&s;embling and &s;mothering the vexation, into which the <HI>Moufti</HI>'s Remon&s;trance had put him, pretended to take his Adverti&s;ements very kindly, and di&s;pos'd him&s;elf to &s;atisfie him, in a &s;hort time, how well he could make his advantage of the Lecture he had read him. He acknowledg'd, that he had often thought of what he had repre&s;ented to him, and that he had a way of Livelihood in his head, which he hop'd would take very well. Some days pa&s;s'd away, ere the Grand Seignor made the lea&s;t mention of Hunting; but at la&s;t, he grows impatient, he leaves the Seraglio, and had the good fortune to kill a Hare with a Gun, the fir&s;t he had ever de&s;troy'd that way. He immediately &s;ends it to the <HI>Moufti,</HI> with order to tell him, That he has follow'd his Advice, and that having learnt the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Hunt&s;man, he has commanded that fir&s;t piece of his Game &s;hould be brought to him, which he was willing to &s;ell, that he might &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Money it &s;hould produce: That he fail not to give twenty Pur&s;es to him who brings it; and that as to his own Per&s;on, he knew well enough what he ought to &s;end him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moufti</HI> conceal'd his &s;urprizal as well as he could, and receiv'd the Hare with great te&s;timonies of his re&s;entments and joy, of the honour, which his High|ne&s;s had done him; and having be&s;tow'd, according to his own order, Twenty Pur&s;es upon the Bearer of the Hare, &s;ends Sixty more to the Grand Seignor him|&s;elf; learning, at his own Co&s;t, and that to the value of Four&s;core thou&s;and Crowns, that men &s;hould not be over-forward to give their Sovereigns tho&s;e Ad|verti&s;ements, which they de&s;ire not of them.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the Pourtraiture of Sultan-<HI>Mahomet,</HI> he is further chargeable with a de|fect of con&s;tancy, in his humour, and a roughne&s;s of deportment towards his People, who are thereupon apt to have the le&s;s Affection for him. And whereas he is indefatigable in his Hunting-Exerci&s;es, and &s;pends whole daies therein, even in the &s;evere&s;t part of the Winter-Sea&s;on, it happen'd, one day, as he was returning home, from the Sport of running down a Stag, that his Grand Faulconer took the boldne&s;s to repre&s;ent to him the inconvenience of expo&s;ing his Slaves &s;o much in the Ice and Snow, by which means there had dy'd about Thirty of them the

The Prince, not mov'd at all with that Remon&s;trance, made this Reply to the Grand Faulconer, That, if the Weather prov'd very hard, they &s;hould have a care of his Dogs, and allow them cloathing, and other accommodations, le&s;t the rigour of the Sea|&s;on might take off any one of them; making not the lea&s;t mention of, or pro|vi&s;ion for the men, whom he &s;acrificed to his Diverti&s;ement. That tough Re|partee having been &s;pread among the People, has begot &s;uch animo&s;ity in them again&s;t this Prince, that there's no que&s;tion made of his being &s;en&s;ible thereof, and that it is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e of his keeping &s;o much at a di&s;tance from the Metropolis of his Empire, where he does not think him&s;elf &s;ecure.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impo&s;&s;ibili|ty of having an exact account of the Womens Appartment&punc;</NOTE> I Make a Chapter by it &s;elf of the Appartment of the Women, only to entertain the Reader, with the impo&s;&s;ibility there is, of having a perfect knowledge of it, or getting any exact account, either what the accomodati|ons of it are; or how the Per&s;ons, who are confin'd therein, behave them|&s;elves. There is not in all Chri&s;tendome any Mona&s;tery of Religious Virgins, how regular and au&s;tere &s;oever it may be, the entrance whereof is more &s;trictly forbidden to men, than is that of this Appartment of the Women: in&s;omuch that my white Eunuch, who has &s;upply'd me with &s;o particular a de&s;cription of the inner part of the Seraglio, could give me no certain information of this Quatter of it, where the Women are lodg'd. All I could get out of him, was, That the Doors of it are kept by <HI>Negro-Eunuchs,</HI> and that, be&s;ides the Grand Seignor him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes, the Phy&s;ician, in ca&s;e of great nece&s;&s;ity, there never enters any man into it, no nor Woman, be&s;ides tho&s;e who live in it, and they are never permittied to go out of it, unle&s;s it be in order to their confinement in the Old Seraglio. But we mu&s;t except, out of that number, the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> and their Maids, or Ladies of Honour, whom the Grand Seignor allows, when he plea&s;es, to come into the Gardens of the Seraglio, and whom he &s;ometimes takes abroad with him, into the Country; yet &s;o as that they cannot be &s;een by any per&s;on what&s;oever. Four <HI>Negro Eunuchs</HI> carry a kind of Pavilion, under which is the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> and the Hor&s;e upon which &s;he is mounted, all &s;ave only the head of the hor&s;e, which is &s;een on the out-&s;ide of the Pavilion, the two fore pieces of which taking him about the Neck, are clo&s;e fa&s;ten'd, above, and below.</P>

And as to the Phy&s;ician, he is never admitted, as I &s;aid, but in ca&s;e of extream nece&s;&s;ity, into the Appartment of the Women, and with &s;uch precautions, that he can neither &s;ee the per&s;on who is indi&s;pos'd, nor be &s;een by her, but to feel her Pul&s;e through a piece of Lawn, all the other Women having retir'd from her Bed-&s;ide, and the <HI>Negro-Eunuchs</HI> having taken their places. Thus you &s;ee what precautions they u&s;e, to deprive the Women, of the Seraglio, of all means of having any acce&s;s to Men, or indeed &s;o much as a &s;ight of them: and if it hap|pen that &s;ome <HI>Jewe&s;s</HI> has enterance into their Quarter, to Trade with them, and to &s;ell them &s;ome little Rarities, they are &s;trictly &s;earch'd by the <HI>Negro-Eunuchs,</HI> le&s;t there &s;hould happen to thru&s;t in &s;ome Man, di&s;guis'd in Woman's Cloaths, in which ca&s;e immediate death would en&s;ue.

DC. XXXIX. and which I &s;hall here in&s;ert in few words. <HI>Amu|rath,</HI> at his return, after the taking of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> came and made his abode, for &s;ome time, at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> He had a Page, belonging to the Trea&s;ury, who was a Native of <HI>Tocat,</HI> in <HI>Natolia,</HI> and, from the place of his brith, they gave him the name of <HI>Tocateli.</HI> He was a well-&s;et Young man, robu&s;t, skillful in Wre&s;tling, and, upon that account, the Grand Seignor had made Chief of the Wre&s;tlers.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that one of the mo&s;t Famous, for that Exerci&s;e, came about that time to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> out of the Confines of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and in all the Cities, through which he travell'd, he had alwaies been too hard for tho&s;e who had pre&s;ented them&s;elves to Wre&s;tle with him. His Reputation was &s;pread all over the Empire, where he had not met with any Wre&s;tler, who acknowledg'd not him&s;elf inferiour to him; Which Report coming to the Page of the Trea&s;ury, he conceiv'd &s;o great an emulation at the Fame of that Man, whom all the World &s;o higly celebrated, that he &s;ent one of the <HI>Halvagis,</HI> to carry him a Civil Challenge from him, and to acquaint him, That he was de&s;irous to have a Tryal of Skill with him, in the Grand Seignor's Pre&s;ence. He &s;ent him word withal, That, before his Highne&s;s had any notice of it, 'twere convenient, they made &s;ome tryal of their &s;trength; And that no body might know any thing of it, he would &s;end him a <HI>Bo&s;tangi</HI>'s Garment and Cap, by which means he might come into the Seraglio.</P>
<P>When the Grand Seignor is not within the Seraglio, where ever it be, the <HI>Bo&s;tangis</HI> are permitted to come into, and to go out of it, by the Garden-Gate; and there being a great number of them, it is no hard matter to get a man in under their accoutrements. By this contrivance did the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Wre&s;tler get into the Seraglio, the next day, upon the &s;ollicitation of the Page, who &s;ent him what was requi&s;ite; the Grand Seignor being that day, gone a Hunting. They both put on Drawers of Leather well liquor'd with &s;ome fat or oyly &s;tuff, all the re&s;t of the body being &s;tark maked, and liquor'd in like manner: and after a long di&s;pute, the Page had the better, whether he got it fairly by his own &s;trength, and skill, or that the other yielded the victory, out of complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>This Action pa&s;s'd in the mid&s;t of the place which is before the Garden, in the pre&s;ence of the Mutes, and all the Pages of the Seraglio; and the Grand Seignor being return'd from Hunting, the Superintendent of the Trea&s;ury told him, That there was come into the City, a <HI>Pehlivan,</HI> a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> by Country, robu&s;t, and of a good meen, of great &s;trength, and well experienced in Wre&s;tling, and that

if his Highne&s;s pleas'd he &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him engag'd in that Exerci&s;e. The Grand Seignor commanded he &s;hould be brought into the Sera|glio, the next day, and that <HI>Tocateli</HI> &s;hould have notice, to be ready to entertain him.</P>
<P>Being both come to the place, and in a condition ready to clo&s;e, the Grand Seignor came into a Gallery, attended by all the Grandees of the Seraglio, to be Spectators of that Tryal of Skill in Wre&s;tling. The Victory having &s;tood as 'twere in the ballance a good while, and all Spectators, being &s;omewhat impatient, to &s;ee which &s;ide it would turn to, a Mute expre&s;s'd him&s;elf by &s;igns, to one of his Companions, to this effect, That he wondered the Page, who &s;hould have deriv'd new &s;trength and courage, from the Grand Seignor's pre&s;ence, found it &s;o difficult to get the better of the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> whom he had &s;o ea&s;ily wor&s;ted the day before&punc;</P>
<P>The language of the Mutes, by &s;igns, is as intiligable in the Seraglio, as if they had the liberty of &s;peaking, and the Grand Seignor, who under&s;tands it as well as any of them, as having been accu&s;tom'd thereto from his Infancy, and commonly di&s;cour&s;ing with them, was &s;trangly &s;urpriz'd, to under&s;tand that the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> had been, the day before, in the &s;ame place. His indignation immediately flu&s;h'd into his face; he commanded the Wre&s;tlers to give over their Exerci&s;e, and, calling the Page to him, he ask'd him, how he had contriv'd that man's enterance into the Seraglio. The unfortunate <HI>Tocateli,</HI> who could not deny a thing, which &s;o many others were ready to re&s;tifie, acquainted his Highne&s;s with what had pa&s;s'd; where|upon, the <HI>Sultan,</HI> incens'd at the greatne&s;s of his confidence, prevented his making an end of the Story, by commanding the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi</HI> to be pre&s;ently &s;ent for, whom he order'd to &s;eize on the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Wre&s;tler, and &s;ee him receive Five hundred blows on the &s;oles of the Feet, with a Wand or Cudgel; which no doubt was enough to make him uncapable of exerci&s;ing him&s;elf, for a good while after. The Over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eer had Orders, to &s;ee the &s;ame puni&s;hment inflicted upon the Page <HI>Tocateli;</HI> which was immediately put in execution: the Grand Seignor having, in the mean time, retir'd into the Appartment of the Women.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion of mo&s;t about the Seraglio, that tho&s;e two unfortunate wretches would have e&s;cap'd, with the puni&s;hment of Five hundred blowes, each of them, upon the &s;oles of their feet. But the Grand Seignor, who was re&s;olv'd to have their lives, and had retir'd, purpo&s;ely into the Lodgings of the Women, to prevent all mediation for their pardon, &s;ent away pre&s;ently a &s;econd Order, to the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Bachi,</HI> whereby he was commanded to &s;ee the Page hang'd up, in the Evening, on a Tree, which is at the Corner of the place where they had Wre&s;tled, and the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> on another Tree, which is without the Gate of the Seraglio.</P>

I thought pertinent to my de&s;ign, to bring in this Story of the Two wre&s;tlers, in order to the greater confirmation of what I have affirm'd at the beginning of this Chapter, concerning the impo&s;&s;ibility there is, for any per&s;on what&s;oever, Man, or Woman, to get into the Appartment of the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es,</HI> when they puni&s;h, with &s;o much &s;everity, a Stranger, who without expre&s;s order, pre&s;umes but to &s;et his foot within any Court of the Seraglio.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to d&s;tin|gui&s;h what's true, and what fabulous, as to the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es.</HI></NOTE> Take it then for granted, that this is all that can be known, with certainty, of the Appartment of the Women, who are &s;ub&s;ervient to the plea&s;ures of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Monarchs; whatever is &s;catter'd abroad, beyond this Account thereof, being grounded only upon imaginations and conjectures, which haply are at a great di&s;tance from the truth. Certain it is, that this Quarter of the Seraglio, as to &s;ome part of it, has a fair Pro&s;pect upon that of the Grand Seignor, and that the Doors of it are kept night and day, by a certain number of <HI>Negro-Eunuchs,</HI> the mo&s;t deformed, and the mo&s;t dreadful to look upon, that can be found. It is certain al&s;o, that it is well furni&s;hed with abundance of mo&s;t beautiful Women, of &s;everal Countries, who, by the chance of War, or otherwi&s;e, are fallen into the hands of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's,</HI> and Governours of Provinces, who &s;end them up, as Pre&s;ents to the Grand Seignor. It is known al&s;o, That, of that variety of Wo|men, the Prince does not appropriate to him&s;elf above two or three, whom he has the greate&s;t affection for; nay &s;ome of tho&s;e Princes have confin'd them&s;elves to the embraces of one only, after intermarriage. And this is affirm'd, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Great, after he had plighted his faith to <HI>Roxulana,</HI> contrary to the ordinary Policy of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after the affront, done by <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mur-leng,</HI> to the Wife of <HI>Bajazet.</HI> The white Eunuchs, who wait in the Grand Seignor's Lodgings, are able in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to give an account of the&s;e things, in regard that the Woman, who is to participate of the Grand Seignor's Bed, is conducted into his own Chamber; and, if it be a new Amour, the noi&s;e of it is &s;pread, the next day, all over the Seraglio.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o known, That the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Women, who is deliver'd of a Male|child, and by that means, becomes Mother to the per&s;umptive Heir of the <HI>Ottoman</HI>-Empire, is con&s;ider'd as the principal <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> and treated according to her dig|nity: and the others, who afterwards have Sons or Daughters, have al&s;o the quality and denomination of <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es;</HI> but the number of the Women, who are to wait on them, is much inferiour, to that of tho&s;e who are to attend the principal <HI>Sultane&s;s.</HI> It is known in fine, That tho&s;e young Princes are brought up under the tutelage of their Mothers, till they are &s;o many years of Age; and when they are &s;trong enough to be put upon certain Exerci&s;es, they have Gover|nours and Ma&s;ters appointed over them, in a di&s;tinct Quarter by them&s;elvs.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e things, which may be po&s;itively known, concerning the Appart|ment of the Women, in the Seraglio, it may well be immagin'd, that the em|belli&s;hments of their Lodgings are an&s;werable to tho&s;e of the Grand Seignor, &s;ince it is the Place, where he pa&s;&s;es away the mo&s;t divertive part of his time. It is al&s;o not to be que&s;tion'd, but that it has its Infirmary, its Baths, and the other accommodations, and conveniences, that can be wi&s;h'd for. It may al&s;o be conjectur'd, that there is, in this Quarter, an ob&s;ervance of the &s;ame regulations, as there are in the Chambers of the <HI>Ichoglans:</HI> That &s;ome of the more ancient Maids are Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es over the Younger ones, and are, night and day em|ploy'd in ob&s;erving their actions; and that their unvoluntary re&s;traint forces them to the &s;ame un&s;eemly Actions among&s;t them&s;elves, as the bruti&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e Young Men engages them in, whenever they can find the opportunities to commit them. And this pre&s;umption has no doubt given occa&s;ion to the Fa|bulous Story, which is related of their being &s;erv'd up with Cucumbers cut into pieces, and not intire, out of a ridiculous fear lea&s;t they &s;hould put them to undecent u&s;es: they who have forg'd the Story not knowing, that it is the cu&s;tome in the <HI>Levant,</HI> to cut the Fruit a-cro&s;s, into great thick &s;lices, as I &s;hall make it appear in the Chapter, where I treat of Gardens. But it is not only in the Seraglio, that that abominable Vice reigns, but it is predominant al&s;o in the City <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in all the Provinces of the Empire, and the wicked Example of the Men, who, &s;lighting the natural u&s;e of Women-kind, are mutually in|flam'd with a dete&s;table love for one another, unfortunately enclines the Women to intimate them.</P>

<P>ON the Second of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year of our Lord, One Thou&s;and, &s;ix Hun|dred, Sixty and Eight, the <HI>Sultane&s;s,</HI> Mother to the Grand Seignor Re|gent, at her return from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> made her Entrance into <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where I then was, of which Entrance take the en&s;uing De&s;cription.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order of the March.</NOTE> About Six in the Morning, &s;ome numbers of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> not ob&s;erving any order, took their way towards the Seraglio, &s;ometimes ten, or more, &s;ometimes twenty, in little detachments, which la&s;ted for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>After them came two hundred men on Hor&s;e-back, belonging to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Cologlou,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Grand Seignor's Favourite, with &s;hort Guns re&s;ting on the Bowe of their Saddles, and all very meanly clad, as al&s;o the Officers of his Kitchin, who coming in the Rear of the others, were, in like manner, poorly habited, and ill mounted. After them appear'd in &s;omewhat a better order, the menial Retinue of the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> his Officers, as well tho&s;e belonging to the Chamber, as tho&s;e of the Stables, were very hand&s;omely mounted, and all in their yellow Gar|ments.</P>
<P>The next appearance was that of the <HI>Spahis,</HI> who are the <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI>-Mother's Life-Guard. Of tho&s;e there were four hundred, which made a hand&s;ome Shew, being all well mounted, and well clad. They had all their Coats of Mail, with their Ve&s;ts of red Taffeta, and had on the right &s;ide a Quiver of Crim&s;on Velvet, em|broider'd with Flowers of Gold; and on the left, a Bowe in a Cover of red Velvet, embroider'd as the other. They had all of them Helmets on their Heads, and over them white Turbants, and from the Helmets there hung &s;mall Chains of Mail, re&s;embling Locks of Hair, which they u&s;e when occa&s;ion requires, to ward off a blow from the Neck and Face. Every one of them had al&s;o a Launce in his hand, and the Trappings of their Hor&s;es were of one of the&s;e three Colours, yellow, violet, and red, of a rich Stuff, with an embroidery of Silver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spahi-Bachi</HI> came in the Rear of them, having a Plume of Heron-tops in his Turbant, three foot in height, which made him remarkable, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd him from all the other <HI>Spahis.</HI> On the brea&s;t-piece of his Hor&s;e, were fa&s;tn'd a dozen little Scarffs, which hung down negligently, and he was attended by &s;ix Pages, who had Caps on, after the <HI>Slavoman</HI> Mode, red Ve&s;ts tuck'd up about the wa&s;te, and yellow Ho&s;e, or Drawers.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Spahis,</HI> there pa&s;s'd &s;everal <HI>Janizaries,</HI> but not marching in any order, follow'd by two hundred men on Hor&s;e-back, and in the Rear of them, came the <HI>Janizary-Aga,</HI> a Per&s;on of a very goodly pre&s;ence. He had for his immediate At|tendants &s;ix gentle young Per&s;ons, who had each of them, hanging over his &s;houlder, a kind of Quiver, full of &s;mall Wands, which are a &s;ort of Arrows, without any Iron-work at the ends.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="318">
After the forementioned, there came up twelve men, who are as it were the Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies, in very ridiculous Accoutrements. They had Silver Wands re&s;ting on their Shoulders, their Ve&s;tments were garni&s;h'd with &s;mall Bells, and they had Caps on, which had &s;omewhat hanging down of each &s;ide, re&s;embling A&s;&s;es Ears.</P>
<P>The next appearance after that extravagant Party, was that of a hundred <HI>Capigis,</HI> all well mounted, every one with a Launce in his hand, with a Flag fa&s;ten'd thereto, reaching from the top to the bottom, which made a very noble Shew. In the Rear of the Troop came the <HI>Capichi bachi,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t by a high and large Plume of Heron-tops, which added much to the gracefulne&s;s of his looks, and Per&s;on.</P>
<P>After them, came a hundred <HI>Chiaoux's,</HI> well clad, and well mounted, having their great Caps on their Heads; and in the Rear of them came the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> having a Cap of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, attended by twenty Pages, very neatly clad.</P>
<P>The next appearance was that of five or &s;ix hundred <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> with their Caps like Sugar-loaves, their Habits of a red linnen Cloath, and Muskets on their Shoulders. The <HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi</HI> came after them, &s;umptuou&s;ly clad, and mounted, with a <HI>Chiaoux</HI>-Cap upon his head, and a great number of People about him.</P>
<P>There appear'd next, two hundred <HI>Cadis,</HI> making a mo&s;t noble Shew, all mo|de&s;tly clad, with their Busquins of black <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Leather, and white Turbants, like great Balls of Wool, or Silk.</P>
<P>They were follow'd by the <HI>Scherifs,</HI> who affirm them&s;elves to be of the kindred of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and made up a Troop of &s;ixty Per&s;ons. As they were the Relations of the Prophet, they wore green Turbants of an extraordinary bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Scherifs,</HI> came the two principal Officers of the <HI>Moufti</HI> (for he never appears in Per&s;on in the&s;e &s;orts of Ceremonies) and they were clad in white, having a very demure and religious Countenance.</P>

The Stirrups were of Gold, and the Hou&s;&s;e was embelli&s;h'd with an embroydery of Gold and Pearls. His Ve&s;t was of a red Brokado, and his Cap like tho&s;e of the <HI>Chiaouxes.</HI> Two men held the Reins of his Bridle, and his Hor&s;e curvetted all along, as if he had been &s;en&s;ible of the goodly pre&s;ence of his Ma&s;ter, and how well it became him. He was a per&s;on of a good &s;tature, and of a graceful Countenance, having withal a mild and &s;prightly look, and every one &s;aluted him, as he advanc'd &s;till towards the Seraglio. The Servants belonging to his Stables marched after him, and fifty Grooms led each of them a Hor&s;e in his hand, and tho&s;e Hor&s;es were all high|priz'd, and their Harne&s;&s;es as &s;umptuous as could be made. 'Tis commonly re|ported, That this Favourite, who is a per&s;on of very great merit, hath acquir'd va&s;t <HI>Riches,</HI> and that his Train, whether as to the number of Servants, or as to that of Hor&s;es, &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of many great Princes.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenues of the Gardens, how employed.</NOTE> IT is an ancient Cu&s;tom, or rather, a Law, e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes, that the profits made out of their Gardens, &s;hould be contributary to the keeping of their own Tables, and they have &s;everal of them, in the Neigh|bourhood of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as well on the <HI>Europaean</HI> &s;ide, as the <HI>A&s;ian,</HI> all along the Sea-&s;hore.

<P>There are in the Seraglio &s;everal Gardens, wherein there are only Flowers, in divers Appartments, and particularly in that of the Grand Seignor, and, no que&s;tion but the &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the Quarter of the <HI>Sultane&s;&s;es.</HI> Yet is there not any thing extraordinary, which might oblige me to give this de&s;cription thereof. The great Garden, whereof the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi</HI> has the over&s;ight, as he has al&s;o of all the others belonging to the Grand Seignor, takes up the greate&s;t part of the Seraglio&punc; and con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of Walks, planted of each &s;ide with Cypre&s;s. Tho&s;e Walks are much neglected, &s;o that in &s;everal places, they are not clear'd of Bryars and Thorns.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cucumbers</HI> a great delicacy among&s;t the <HI>Levantines.</HI></NOTE> As to the Cucumbers, they commonly eat them without taking off any thing of the rinde, after which they go and drink a gla&s;s of Water.

to eat, whereas in our <HI>Europaean</HI> Countries, they would give him bread; in the <HI>Levant,</HI> they bring him only a Cucumber, which he eats raw, as it comes out of the Garri&s;on. Laborious per&s;ons, and &s;uch as are in a manner tyr'd with work|ing, &s;uch as Camel-drivers, and tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the care of the Hor&s;es, and Mules, in the Caravans, make a kind of Salled of their Cucumbers, not much unlike the Ma&s;h, which we would give our Hor&s;es. When they are come to the Lodging place, where the Caravan is to make a &s;tay, they take a large Ba&s;in, which they almo&s;t, fill with water, and having put &s;ome &s;owr milk into it, they cut a great number of Cucumbers, into great &s;lices, and, &s;o make a kind of ma&s;h of them. 'Tis a plea&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee them at the confounding of it. Among&s;t ten, or twelve, who all &s;tand round the &s;aid Ba&s;in, there is but one woo|den Spoon, which every one takes his turn, till they have made a &s;hift to empty the Ba&s;in. That done, they fall a drinking of water, and tho&s;e who have where|withall, go and take a di&s;h of Coffee, or &s;moke a Pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>But to do them all the right they deferve, the Cucumbers, in the <HI>Leavant</HI> are ex|cellently good, and, though eaten raw, they never do a man any hurt. The Story of the Cucmbers which occa&s;ion'd the cruel death of Seven Pages of the Grand Seignor's Chamber, is not, haply, known to all people; or at lea&s;t, all know not the rea&s;on, why the Pages of the Chamber are not now permitted to go into the Gardens.</P>
<P>Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the &s;econd of that name, taking a turn in the Gardens of the Seraglio, attended by his Pages, was much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee a bed of Cucumbers, which look'd very fair to the eye, and were extreamly forward con&s;idering the Sea&s;on. Being 2 great lover of that fruit, he recommended them to the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-bachi,</HI> who told them over every day, and, with &s;ome impatience, expected their maturity, that he might pre&s;ent them to the Grand Seignor. Some daies after, going to Vi&s;it the bed, he found his number of Cucumbers &s;horter, than it &s;hould have been, by three or four, and that they who had taken tho&s;e that were mi&s;&s;ing, had made choice of the ripe&s;t, and thereupon making a &s;trict enquiry, to find out who had been guilty of that pre&s;umption, he found that the Pages of the Cham|ber were the only per&s;ons who had been, that day, in the Gardens.</P>
<P>Upon that di&s;covery, he went and gave an account of the whole matter to the Grand Seignor, who was &s;o highly incens'd thereat, that, not prevailing with any one of the Pages to acknowledge the Theft, he, out of a cruelty as much above all credit, as beyond all example, caus'd the Bellies of &s;even of them to be ripp'd up. The Theft was found in the Belly of the &s;eventh of tho&s;e unfortunate Young Men, who, after the execution done on the other &s;ix, would not acknowledge his guilt, out of hopes, that the Prince's indignation would not have extended &s;o far. From that very time, and in commemoration of &s;o &s;trange an action, the Pages of the Cham|ber are not permitted to go into the Gardens of the Seraglio; what one Prince has e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as I have hinted el&s;ewhere, being never revok'd by his Succe&s;&s;ors, who bear a certain re&s;pect to the enactions of their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pyramid, much re&s;emb|ling <HI>Trajan's</HI> Pilliar.</NOTE> In the mid&s;t of the Great Walk, which goes from the Seraglio, to the Sea-Gate which looks towards <HI>Scudaret,</HI> there is a Pyramid, erected upon a &s;quare Pede&s;tal, and which four men would have much ado to fathom. About the Pede&s;tal they have &s;uffer'd &s;ome bryars and thorns to grow, and it &s;eems to have been done out of de&s;ign, to hinder peoples coming clo&s;e to it. The Pyramid, from the top to the bottom, is full of Figures, whereof the heads are &s;truck off; and it may be conjectur'd by &s;ome remainders, that there was a very noble head on the top of it, as being the Ma&s;ter piece of the work. This Pyramid &s;omewhat re&s;e&s;embles <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Pillar at Rome; and &s;ome, who have &s;een both, imagine, they were the work of the &s;ame ma&s;ter.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General Laws for all the <HI>Ma|humetan</HI> Sects.</NOTE> I Have &s;o often had oca&s;ion, in the pre&s;ent Relation I have made of the Grand Seignor's Seraglio, to &s;peak of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, that I am content before I put a period to this Work, to make it appear, how far it extends into the three parts of our great Continent: <HI>Mahumeti&s;me</HI> having not yet &s;et footing into that which has been di&s;cover'd but two Ages &s;ince. I meddle not at all with the Doctrine of it, of which I am &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ur'd that many per&s;ons have written: and I &s;hall only entertain the Reader with a Geographical Chart of all the Countries of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> which are under the dominion of the followers of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Opinions of their Doctors be different, as to what conecrns the Explication of the Law, and that there are principally two great Sects, that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which is the Stock; and that of <HI>Hali,</HI> one of his principal Succe&s;&s;ors: Yet tho&s;e two general Sects, and the particular ones, which are derivable thence, are all concordant in the fundamental Points, which every <HI>Mahumetan</HI> is oblig'd, in Con&s;cicnce, to ob&s;erve and practi&s;e. Of tho&s;e I gave an account, when I made mention of the Prayers or Devotions, which the <HI>Turks</HI> are bound to perform five times a day, and the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha</HI> is one of tho&s;e principal Articles. I have al&s;o &s;aid &s;omething of them, in the Chapters treating of the Pre&s;ent, which the Grand Seignor &s;ends thither every Year; and in this la&s;t, I &s;hall endeavour to expre&s;s my &s;elf fully as to that matter.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> we have no <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Princes but the Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Cham</HI> of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Tartary:</HI> But in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> there are many of them, who are powerful, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of great Dominions. The Grand Seignor extends his Juri&s;diction, in this part, beyond the Sources of the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> and beyond the mouths, by which it falls into the Sea, and towards the North, as far as the Territories of the <HI>Mengrelians.</HI> To go thence from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t, next the Grand Seignor, we mu&s;t count the Princes of the Three <HI>Arabia</HI>'s, with &s;everal of whom I have often &s;poken, in Two of my Voyages, wherein <HI>I</HI> have been oblig'd to pa&s;s through the De&s;arts. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> the Kings on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> of whom the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is that of <HI>Comorin;</HI> the Great <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Kings of the Mountains, to the North &s;ide of the &s;ame <HI>Tartary,</HI> who are got into <HI>China;</HI> All the&s;e Kings, <HI>I</HI> &s;ay, follow the <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="320">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A curious Re|mark of the Emeperour of <HI>Java</HI>'s Son.</NOTE> Since I have mentioned the Emperour of <HI>Java,</HI> I &s;hall, by the way, in&s;ert here an ob&s;ervation, which <HI>I</HI> made at the time of my being in that I&s;land, which was, That the elde&s;t Son of that Emperour, who regin'd in the year 1648. had &s;ix fingers on each of his hands, and &s;ix toes one each foot, and all of equal length.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings following the Doctrine of <HI>Hali.</HI></NOTE> The Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia, Vi&s;apour</HI> and <HI>Golconda</HI> follow the Sect of <HI>Hali;</HI> and the Kings of the mountains of <HI>Tartary,</HI> with &s;ome others, have al&s;o their particular Sects. Be&s;ides, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that if we except the Grand Seignor, the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes, and the <HI>Cham</HI> of Great <HI>Tartary,</HI> all the other Kings, whom <HI>I</HI> have named, have only Idolaters to their Subjects, and all the meaner &s;ort of people is involv'd in the darkne&s;s of Pagani&s;m. But as to the Grand Seignor's, with all his Militia, they follow the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Africa,</HI> there is a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> King, who&s;e Territories lie all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Abex,</HI> which is towards <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> as far as the Cape of <HI>Guardafu,</HI> and his Juri&s;diction extends over the Red Sea, and the Ocean. The Governours, whom the Grand Seignor employs in <HI>Egypt,</HI> aud in the I&s;lands of the Red Sea, and tho&s;e others, whom he has e&s;tabli&s;h'd all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> at <HI>Tripoli, Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Argiers,</HI> who a&s;&s;ume the Title of Kings, are al&s;o <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> and, in fine, the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco</HI> follows the &s;ame Law.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Kings and Princes, are principally unanimous in this Point, That they acknowledg them&s;elves oblig'd to &s;end every year &s;ome Pre&s;ent to <HI>Mecha,</HI> which ordi|narily con&s;i&s;ts in rich Carpets, to be put upon <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Sepulchre. Sometimes the&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great <HI>Mo|gul</HI>'s Royal &s;ent to <HI>Mecha.</HI></NOTE>Pre&s;ents are made upon a particular Vow; and it happen'd in one of my Voyages to <HI>Agra,</HI> that the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> by way of thankfulne&s;s to the Prophet, for the re|covery of his health, &s;ent to <HI>Mecha,</HI> an <HI>Alcoron,</HI> valued at four hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which had, in the mid&s;t of the Cover, a Diamond, of three hundred Carats; the re&s;t of it being garni&s;h'd with &s;everal precious Stones on both &s;ides. The occa&s;ion of this Pre&s;ent was, the fright which a certain <HI>Bramere,</HI> put him into, upon his telling him, That he &s;hould die before the year was expir'd, which happen'd not accordingly. But the King being extremely incens'd at that direful Prediction, and, upon the &s;mart Interrogatory he put to the <HI>Bramere,</HI> to wit, whether he knew al&s;o the time of his own death, having receiv'd this An&s;wer, That it &s;hould be within three days; which really happen'd upon the third day, there was a &s;ufficient ground for him to be frightned, and to conceive an appre|hen&s;ion, that the like accident might happen to him&s;elf, before the time limited. 'Twas that induc'd him to &s;end a Pre&s;ent of &s;o great value, to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Sepulchre, to acknowledge the favour he had done him, in not &s;uffering the Prediction of the <HI>Bramere</HI> to take effect, the King having not had as much as any indi&s;po&s;ition, during all that time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;everal ways whereby the <HI>Mahume|tans</HI> come to the Sepulchre of their Prophet.</NOTE> When I gave an account of the Pilgrimage of <HI>Mecha,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of the Tent and Carpet, which the Grand Seignor &s;ends thither every year, I made no mention of the &s;everal ways which the Caravans take, according to the &s;everal parts of the World, from whence great multitudes of <HI>Mahumetans</HI> do every year take their progre&s;s thither.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the Amba&s;&s;adors, whom the Kings of the I&s;lands, whereof I have given you the names, and the Kings of the <HI>Indies,</HI> on this &s;ide the <HI>Ganges,</HI> &s;end to the <HI>Sheck</HI> of <HI>Mecha,</HI> with their Pre&s;ents come by Sea, to <HI>Mocha,</HI> a Maritime City of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> and from thence they travel to <HI>Mecha</HI> by Land, by the conveniency of Camels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who inhabit all along the Sea-&s;ide make their de&s;cent from <HI>Ormus,</HI> or to <HI>Bandar,</HI> and having pa&s;s'd over the Gulf, which, at that place, is not above twelve or thirteen Leagues in breadth, are forc'd to cro&s;s <HI>Arabia</HI> ere they can get to the Prophet's City. But the Inhabitants of the upper-parts of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> towards the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and all the <HI>Tartars,</HI> come to <HI>Tauris,</HI> and from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> from which place, the great Caravans, which take their progre&s;s through the De&s;arts, &s;et forth, and bring the Pilgrims to <HI>Mecha.</HI> Some take the way of <HI>Babylon,</HI> but very &s;eldom, becau&s;e the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> exacts a Tribute of them, and particularly of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> whom they account Hereticks; and that con&s;ideration has oblig'd the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to for|bid his Subjects to take that Rode, thinking him&s;elf not inferiour to the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trouble&s;ome De&s;arts in the way to <HI>Hali</HI>'s Sepulchre.</NOTE> Some of the Devouter &s;ort of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and &s;uch as are mo&s;t zealous for their own Sect, take the way of <HI>Babylon,</HI> upon this &s;core, that brings them at the &s;ame time to the Sepulchre of their Prophet <HI>Hali,</HI> which is but eight days Journey di&s;tant from it. This is the mo&s;t wretched place, of all the places upon earth, and affords no water but the mo&s;t corrupted water, which is drawn out of certain Pits, and that of a Canal, which <HI>Scbach-Abas</HI> caus'd to be brought thither from the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> but which is now quite out of repair. Whoever expects to drink good water there, mu&s;t bring it along with him, from other pla|ces, five or &s;ix days Journey di&s;tant from the other: And yet that fal&s;e Pro|phet impo&s;es on tho&s;e, who have &s;uch a Devotion for him, not only the inconveniences of coming &s;o far off; but al&s;o tho&s;e of being in a fair way to peri&s;h by thri&s;t, and hard&s;hip of lodging.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time it was my fortune to pa&s;s through the De&s;arts, I came to that dete&s;table place upon this occa&s;ion, that meeting with a Courrier, who was come from <HI>Babylon,</HI> with two <HI>Arabians,</HI> whom he had in his Com|pany, he gave us intelligence, that the Grand Seignor's Forces, which had then newly taken <HI>Babylon,</HI> were upon their march back, in little Deteachments, and that there was no que&s;tion to be made, but they would &s;eize on our Camels and Baggage. Which adverti&s;ements oblig'd us to take our cour&s;e more to the South, and to get further into the De&s;ert, where we &s;pent &s;ixty and five days in cro&s;&s;ing of it, to avoid meeting with tho&s;e Forces.</P>
<P>As for the Princes of <HI>Arabia,</HI> they have no great Journey to make, becau&s;e they are the next neighbours to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Sepulchre.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Miraculous Canal of water of the length of <HI>18</HI> days journey.</NOTE> The <HI>Mahumetans</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> come to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and there joyn the Caravan; and tho&s;e of <HI>Africa,</HI> pa&s;s to Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> and meet in the De&s;arts, with the &s;ame Caravan of <HI>Aleppo</HI> at eighteen days Journey from <HI>Medina,</HI> where there is a water, which goes by a Canal, quite to that City, all the way of tho&s;e eight|een days Journey. They have it by Tradition, That that water was found by their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as he cro&s;s'd the De&s;ert with his Army, ready to dye for thir&s;t, and that going to drink of it fir&s;t of any, there i&s;&s;ued a Voice to him out of the Water, which &s;aid to him, <HI>Prophet, thou wilt find it bitter:</HI> That he made the Voice this An&s;wer, <HI>Let us all drink of it, for I know it is &s;weet, and I would to God, that we could always find as good.</HI> That thereupon the Voice replying the &s;econd time, <HI>Prophet, Command, and I will follow thee:</HI> And that as &s;oon as he had &s;poken, the Water made a Canal under ground, and follow'd him quite to <HI>Medina.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Damas, Hieru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Cairo,</HI> they account forty days Journey to <HI>Medina,</HI> and it is at the two and twentieth day's journey that they find that water. Tis part|ly to &s;ee that miraculous Water, which had been &s;weetned by the Prophet, that there goes into tho&s;e places &s;o great a concour&s;e of People, of &s;o many different Nations, from all parts of the World: in as much as there is no <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> let him be at ever &s;o great a di&s;tance, and but tolerably in a condition of health, and &s;upply'd with the external accommodations of fortune, who does not think him&s;elf oblig'd to go once in his life to <HI>Mecha,</HI> in per&s;on, or to &s;end &s;ome other in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>After the Pilgrims have continu'd certain days at <HI>Medina,</HI> they go to <HI>Gebel-Araffa,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the place, where <HI>Adam</HI> found <HI>Eve,</HI> his Wife, five hundred years, after God had created her. It is a City in the Mountains, at the di&s;tance of Two Dayes Journey from <HI>Medina,</HI> and at one from <HI>Emena,</HI> another City, which is half way be|tween both. A&s;&s;oon as the Pilgrims are come thither, all tho&s;e who are &s;o well fur|ni&s;h'd, buy a Weather to make a Holocau&s;t of it, and to di&s;tribute it among&s;t the poor, they being not allow'd to keep above two pounds of it, for them&s;elves. If they do not punctually ob&s;erve that, and that &s;ome di&s;covery &s;hould be made thereof, they are made incapable, ever after, while they live, of &s;having their Heads, or paring their Nails.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gebel-Araffa,</HI> they return to <HI>Medina,</HI> where they keep an account of the time, when the Caravan arrived there; in regard that all the Pilgrims, who came by Land, are, as I &s;aid el&s;ewhere, mantain'd with &s;u&s;tenance for the &s;pace of Se|venteen days; but they who came by Sea are &s;u&s;tain'd, as long as they continue there, even though they &s;hould make it the place of their abode, as long as they live.</P>

<P>_THE en&s;uing Narration was put into my hands Five or Six Years ago, by a very Intelligent Worthy Per&s;on, who long re&s;ided in the &s;ame Family with our Author, and did a&s;&s;ure me, that the Di&s;cour&s;e here publi&s;hed, was written with his own hand, and pre&s;ented unto that Honourable Per&s;on who redeemed him out of Captivity. The Gentleman who be&s;towed the&s;e Papers upon me, will not be re&s;pon|&s;ible for the Truth of all therein contained; but I having compared his Account of &s;everal Countries with that of <HI>Olearius</HI> and other more Ancient and Modern Writers, have found them very Con|&s;onant unto each other, and therefore do charitably belive him no le&s;s Faithful in his De&s;cription of tho&s;e Countries and People concerning whom little hath been &s;aid by any be&s;ides. By rea&s;on of his long ab&s;ence from his Native Country, and di&s;-u&s;e of his Mother-Tongue, his &s;tyle was &s;o rough, odd, and unplea&s;ant, that I was forced to make therein great Alterations both as to Method and Expre&s;&s;ion, yet keeping &s;trictly unto his &s;en&s;e: I have al&s;o much abbreviated his Di&s;cour&s;e, many things being often repeated, and he having &s;tuffed it with divers impertinencies, which would have been void of all In&s;truction and Delight. He would never own his true Name or Pedigree, for Rea&s;ons mentioned in his Paper, which I thought al|together unnece&s;&s;ary to be rehear&s;ed; that of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> wherewith he concludes his <HI>NARRATIVE,</HI> being fictitious, and I &s;uppo&s;e a&s;&s;umed, becau&s;e of his long Re&s;idence in a City of that name, from which he made mo&s;t of his Excur&s;ions: And which with the Adjacent Country he hath above all others mo&s;t particularly de|&s;cribed, giving us the names of &s;everal Neighbouring Places and Rivers mentioned by no other Writer. I was highly plea&s;ed with the Account he gives us of <HI>Czarofs|gorod,</HI> which he al&s;o &s;ometimes calls <HI>Seraichan</HI> and <HI>Seraichena;</HI> the former of which is the <HI>Mu&s;coviti&s;h,</HI> the latter the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Appellation, and inrepreted, both &s;ignifie the Habitation of the Emperour or <HI>Cham,</HI> it being formerly the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of a great Empire.

He al|ways calls the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, <HI>Mare Chozar:</HI> and all that Countrey on the North and to the We&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, <HI>Terra Chozar.</HI> He acquaints us, that the Re&s;idence of the Prince of <HI>Chozar</HI> was not far above the Mouth of the <HI>Volga,</HI> which the <HI>Tartars</HI> call <HI>Athel;</HI> which name I &s;uppo&s;e it derived from <HI>Attila,</HI> that Renowned King of the <HI>Hunns,</HI> being &s;o called in the Relation of the Amba&s;&s;adors who were &s;ent by the Emperour <HI>Ju&s;tine,</HI> unto the Great <HI>Chacan</HI> of the <HI>Turks</HI> re&s;iding in the Ea&s;t. <HI>Al Eari&s;i</HI> and his Epitomizer, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Geographus Nubien|&s;is</HI> intimate, That the&s;e <HI>Chozars</HI> inhabited divers other Cities, but that this was the Mettopolis; he &s;urpre&s;&s;es the Name, &s;tyling it only from the River, the City of <HI>Athel;</HI> and declares it was divided by the River, the chief and greate&s;t part being on the We&s;t-&s;ide; and that the other le&s;s con&s;iderable on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, was inhabited only by the meaner &s;ort of People and Merchants, it being a place of great Trade, that which made it more con&s;iderable, was the liberty allowed unto all of the Publick Profe&s;&s;ion, and Exerci&s;e of their re&s;pective Religious Per&s;wa&s;ions, <HI>Jews, Chri&s;tians, Mahumetans,</HI> and <HI>Idolaters</HI> being there equally countenanced, which I &s;uppo&s;e might occa&s;ion that Dialogue publi&s;hed out of an Ancient <HI>Hebrew</HI> Manu&s;cript, by <HI>L' Empereur,</HI> between the Author a <HI>Jewe&s;h</HI> Rabbi, and the King of <HI>Chozar.</HI> This City is &s;aid to have been extended along the River three miles in length, and its breadth proportionable; the We&s;tern part well fortified; adorned with the Emperours Palace, and &s;everal other eminent Structures. <HI>Na&s;&s;ir Eddin,</HI> who wrote at the latter end of the 13th.

C.</HI> 900. For <HI>Alferganus</HI> who lived about that Time, places no other Nation in his Table of Climes, between <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Bori&s;thenes;</HI> And <HI>Eutichius,</HI> who worte about 30 or 40 years after, makes mention of them as a mighty Nation, and many amon&s;t them con|verted unto the Chri&s;tian Belief. About the middle of the 10th Century the&s;e <HI>Cha|zari</HI> gave place unto the <HI>Cumanians</HI> or <HI>Commanians,</HI> who were al&s;o a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Nation known unto the <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Kaphjack;</HI> whether they expelled the <HI>Chazari,</HI> or that the former becoming the more Eminent Tribe, gave Law and Name unto the&s;e latter (as hath &s;ince frequently happened among the <HI>Tartars)</HI> I will not here undertake to determine: but this is certain, that &s;uddenly the Name of <HI>Chazari</HI> was extinct, and all that Tract of Land from the <HI>Nepper</HI> unto <HI>Turke&s;tan</HI> 1500 miles beyond the <HI>Volga,</HI> was inhabited by the&s;e <HI>Cumanians,</HI> who were often trouble&s;ome unto the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es, Lithuanians, Hungarians,</HI> and other Neighbour-Na|tions. But this People was almo&s;t totally de&s;troyed by the <HI>Tartars</HI> in that great In|undation which happened at the beginning of the 12th Century, &s;oon after the death of <HI>Jingiz Chan;</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Hocota</HI> being cho&s;en Emperour, &s;ent his Nephew <HI>Ba|tu,</HI> or <HI>Bathy,</HI> the Son of <HI>Tu&s;&s;y Jingiz Chan,</HI> his Elde&s;t Son with 400000 Men, to in|vade the Northern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The <HI>Cumani</HI> for divers years valianty re&s;i&s;ted, and made the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition the <HI>Tartars</HI> met with in all their Conque&s;ts; repuls'd them in two pitch'd Battels; but then growing &s;ecure, and di&s;per&s;ing upon the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> retreat, they were unexpectedly &s;urprized, the whole Countrey over-run, above 200000 killed, their King <HI>Kuthen</HI> hardly e&s;caping with 40000 into <HI>Hungary,</HI> where
<PB REF="322">
he met with a kind reception, had land allotted him, and his Company; which Re|gion is called <HI>Campus Cumanus</HI> unto this day. This Countrey was &s;o mi&s;erably wa|&s;ted by the <HI>Tartars</HI> that in the Years 1253, and 1254, when <HI>Rubriquis</HI> pa&s;ted through ir, going unto and returning from his Amba&s;&s;age to <HI>Mangu Chan,</HI> there was no fixed habitation, excepting a few Cottages in the I&s;land where <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> is now &s;itu|ated.</P>
<P>But <HI>Bathy</HI> having de&s;troyed the <HI>Comanians,</HI> ruinated their Cities, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his own Dominion, began to think of a fix'd aboade, which after long ob&s;ervation he cho&s;e near the River <HI>Volga,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and immediately beneath the River <HI>Acta|bon,</HI> a great Arm of the <HI>Volga,</HI> and the fir&s;t it di&s;mi&s;les, which empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian-Sea</HI> (having run a cour&s;e of near 400 miles, and received &s;everal other Branches from the fore&s;aid River) about 7 Leagues Ea&s;t off the main River. He had newly began this City at the return of <HI>Rubriquis</HI> from his Emba&s;&s;age unto <HI>Man|gu Chan,</HI> in the year 1246, and called <HI>Serai;</HI> which City was enlarged and beau|tified by all his Succe&s;&s;ors, unto the time of its de&s;truction by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> which was almo&s;t 150 years. <HI>Bathy</HI> was &s;ucceded by <HI>Barcah,</HI> who was the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Emperour; he by <HI>Hocola,</HI> or <HI>Hoctay,</HI> Contemporary with <HI>Hayton</HI> the <HI>Ar|menian,</HI> who hath in his Hi&s;tory largely di&s;cour&s;ed concerning him: I &s;hould here men|tion all the other Emperours interceeding between <HI>Hocota</HI> and <HI>Tucktami&s;ch</HI> (who was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Tamerlane)</HI> together with their Acts, but that I ha&s;ten unto that which mo&s;t immediately concerns our pre&s;ent De&s;ign, and give &s;ome account of this City, which (as I &s;aid) was fir&s;t named <HI>Serai,</HI> which interpreted &s;ignifies only a Dwelling or Habitation; the beginning of it being a Palace built for <HI>Bathy.</HI> You may &s;ee what our Traveller &s;ays concering it, <HI>Page</HI> 112. Be&s;ides him I find two Authors who make particular mention thereof; the fir&s;t is in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Arab&s;hiade,</HI> pub|li&s;hed by <HI>Golius.</HI> This Author repre&s;ents it as one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t populous Cities in the Univer&s;e, agrees with out Traveller in the &s;ituation, only he calls that Branch which runs out of the <HI>Volga</HI> and pa&s;&s;es to the South-Ea&s;t, <HI>Sencle.</HI> The other is <HI>Michovius,</HI> who wrote his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the year. 1515. He affirms, That in his time there remained the ruines of 300 Temples be&s;ides the Walls of the City, and &s;everal other Magnificent Structures. The <HI>Tarters</HI> have &s;e|veral times attempted to re-edifie it, but divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves, Wars with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and attempts of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> cau&s;ed them to retire unto places of greater &s;ecurity. But becau&s;e little mention is made of this great Revolution by any <HI>European</HI> Writer I &s;hall here pre&s;ent the Reader with an account thereof out of the mo&s;t Authentick <HI>Turki&s;h, Arabian,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Writers. For <HI>Calcondilas</HI> is greatly mi|&s;taken, who &s;eems to have received by his confident way of writing, mo&s;t particular information, when as nothing can be more remote from the truth than what he af|firms, <HI>viz,</HI> That <HI>Tamerlane</HI> after &s;everal attempts, and two or three Battles was forced to retire, and glad to &s;ecure his Retreat by a Peace, he fir&s;t made with <HI>Tucktha|mi&s;ch,</HI> which was by both afterwards kept inviolable; which is contrary to the Re|ports of much more Authentick Hi&s;torians. The Origin, Progre&s;s, and Event of this War, was after the en&s;uing manner.</P>
<P><HI>Tamerlane</HI> being in effect Prince, but in name only <HI>Courachan</HI> (the <HI>Greeks</HI> call it <HI>Kurgant)</HI> that is, Viceroy or General over all tho&s;e Countries which are comprehend|ed between the <HI>Oxus</HI> and <HI>Jaxartes,</HI> wherein <HI>Bochara, Samarchand,</HI> and &s;everal other famous Cities were contained, extended his Conque&s;ts towards <HI>Balch</HI> and <HI>Chora&s;an,</HI> (the <HI>Aria</HI> of the Antients;) which progre&s;s of his, filled <HI>Thuetami&s;ch</HI> Emperour of <HI>Serai</HI> (the City we have beforementioned) with jealou&s;ies of his growing Greatne&s;s; whereupon gathering a numerous Army, he re&s;olved to invade him, u&s;ing no forma|lity, or &s;o much as pretence, he thought to have &s;urprized his Enemy; but <HI>Tamer|lane,</HI> one of who&s;e Ma&s;ter-pieces was to gain early Intelligence of what&s;oever was de|&s;igned, or tran&s;acted by neighbouring Princes, having timely notice of his intention, gathering all his own Forces, together with con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Confe|derates, marched directly towards his Enemy, and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Jaxartes,</HI> met him to his no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment, on the Borders of his own Countrey; for the <HI>Jaxartes</HI> on|ly divided their Territories. After a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate bloody fight, <HI>Tameriane</HI> gained the Victory, yet neither ab&s;olute, nor without great lo&s;s, but it was &s;ufficient that he
<PB REF="323">
had &s;ecured his own Dominion. After this &s;ucce&s;s he did for divers years attend other Conque&s;ts, and having &s;ubdued a great part of <HI>India,</HI> all <HI>Per&s;ia, Media, Armenia, A&s;&s;yria, Me&s;opotamia, Babylonia,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> he re&s;olved to requite the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Thu|ctami&s;h:</HI> whereupon having drawn together an Army of 500000 men, he marched through <HI>Mediae Atropatia,</HI> then and &s;till called <HI>Shervan;</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Portae Cauca&s;iae,</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> name <HI>Derbent;</HI> thence through <HI>Dahe&s;tan,</HI> and the great De&s;art be|tween that and <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> (then named <HI>Gitturchan)</HI> and having wa&s;ted all that &s;pacious Countrey on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Volga,</HI> depoulated and di&s;mantled divers fair Ci|ties (the ruines of &s;everal being yet vi&s;ible to tho&s;e who Navigate the <HI>Volga,</HI> as we are informed by <HI>Olearius)</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Volga,</HI> and on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide encoun|tred <HI>Thuctami&s;ch,</HI> who had Collected a mighty Force, having be&s;ides his own <HI>Hords,</HI> the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;&s;an, Tumen, Kalmuke,</HI> and <HI>Dahe&s;tan:</HI> and his Army by this acce&s;&s;ion was more numerous than that of his Enemy. The Battel was long doubtful, and exceeding all that happened in that Age for carnage and cruelty, both Parties being full of hatred unto their Adver&s;aries; and knowing that this Fight would lo&s;e or gain them a mighty Empire. They fought three days with little in|termi&s;&s;ion, and it could not be di&s;cerned which had the advantage. But that which is thought chiefly to have occa&s;ioned <HI>Tamerlane</HI>'s Victory, was the departure of a great Tribe from <HI>Thuctami&s;ch,</HI> who&s;e Prince <HI>Ectave</HI> pretended he had received &s;ome great injury or affront, but 'twas indeed thought he was corrupted: For retreating unto <HI>Amuarth</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, he after the &s;ame mannner betrayed <HI>Bajazet,</HI> who &s;oon after &s;ucceeded; revolting at the beginning of the fight unto <HI>Tamerlane. Thucta|mi&s;ch</HI> being defeated, with great difficulty made his e&s;cape, leaving his Countrey ex|po&s;ed unto the fury of the <HI>Zagataians,</HI> whom &s;o great a &s;laughter of their own Friends had highly exa&s;perated. They &s;pared nothing that was capable of being &s;poiled; demoli&s;hed <HI>Serai,</HI> together with <HI>Seraichick</HI> upon the <HI>Jaick,</HI> and <HI>Gitturchan,</HI> which were the only con&s;iderable Cities on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Volga,</HI> and leaving the Countrey a meer De&s;art, killing, or Captivating the Inhabitants, driving away the Cattle, they returnd into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with great Booty. This happened in the 791 year of the <HI>Hegira. A. C.</HI> 1388. <HI>Serai,</HI> and <HI>Saraichick</HI> never regained thir former &s;plen|dour; but <HI>(Gitturcan</HI> now <HI>A&s;tracan)</HI> did by degrees recover, but never arrived to that heighth it attained unto during the Empire of the <HI>Chazari</HI> and <HI>Zavolgen&s;ian Tar|tars.</HI></P>

But after its &s;ubver|&s;ion by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> this Commerce cea&s;ed and the Gallies receiving their Lading in <HI>Syria,</HI> and at <HI>Alexandria</HI> of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> In the time of the forementioned Writers, which was from the year 1436. when <HI>Barbaro</HI> fir&s;t went to <HI>Tana,</HI> until his return out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in 1488. And <HI>Contarini,</HI> who returned not long before him, <HI>Citrachan</HI> was a mean Town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of <HI>Tartarian</HI> Huts and incompa&s;&s;ed with a pitiful mud-Wall, a place of no con&s;iderable Traffick, only the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> fetch'd thence Fi&s;h and Salt. But <HI>Juan Va&s;&s;ilowich</HI> having reduced it in the year 1554 under his Dominion, it hath been by &s;ucceeding Emperours both fortified and enlarged: I &s;hall &s;ay no more concerning it, <HI>Olearius</HI> a mo&s;t deligent and judicious Writer, having left us &s;o particular a De&s;cription thereof. I &s;hall only add, That I &s;uppo&s;e the cau&s;e of &s;o diffrent names, as <HI>Gittarchan, Citrachan,</HI> and <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> were occa&s;ioned by the Princs, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively prae&s;ided, as is very obvious to any who are acquainted with the Cu&s;tomes of the <HI>Arabians, Per&s;ians, Turks,</HI> and other Ea&s;tern People.</P>
<P>But to return unto our <HI>Zavolgentian Tartars,</HI> &s;o called by the Neighbouring <HI>Slavonick</HI> Nations, becau&s;e the Seat of their Empire, and their chiefe&s;t places of Re|&s;idence were on, or near the <HI>Volga</HI> (which River did al&s;o almo&s;t equally divide their Territory) <HI>Za</HI> being only an Expletive Particle, as I could manife&s;t by In|duction
<PB REF="323">
of &s;everal <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian, Poli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Lithuanian</HI> Names of Men and Countries. After the deva&s;tation of their Countrey they would notwith&s;tanding have &s;oon re|covered their former Grandeur, had not divi&s;ions and inte&s;tine Wars long kept them low; and at length after divers wonderful and great Revolutions given the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> lea&s;ure fir&s;t to breath, and then invite them to deprive them of the be&s;t part of their Dominion. They not able to re&s;i&s;t, being broken, as I &s;aid, by Di&s;cord and Divi&s;ion into divers petty Principalities. And on the other &s;ide the <HI>Crim Tartar,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;ubdued the remainder, whereby that Tribe which before was comparatively incon&s;iderable, became Supreme, and is at this day a terror un|to all the North-Ea&s;t Countries of Chri&s;tendom. To &s;hew in what manner, and by what degrees all this was tran&s;acted, is rather matter of a ju&s;t Hi&s;tory, than of a Preface the <HI>decorum</HI> whereof <HI>I</HI> have already tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, in making a Porch almo&s;t as large as the main Building, to which it &s;hould &s;erve only for an Entrance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore conclude with &s;ome &s;hort and &s;light Remarks on diver Pa&s;&s;ages in our Authors Relation. His account of the <HI>Periplus</HI> of the <HI>Exuine</HI> Sea, (leaving out what he allows for the <HI>Teine Sea,</HI> or <HI>Palus Moetis)</HI> differs little in number of Miles from that of <HI>Arrian,</HI> though they di&s;agree &s;omewhat in particular di&s;tances; and is wonder|fully con&s;onant to that calculation of <HI>Erato&s;thones, Hecataeus, Ptolomy,</HI> and <HI>Ammianus Marchellinus,</HI> who reckon it to amount unto 23000 <HI>Stadia,</HI> or 2875 Miles, which wants but 15 of our Travellers Computation.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o more particular, and <HI>I</HI> believe, more exact than any I have hitherto met with, in his De&s;cription of <HI>Crim</HI> or <HI>Taurica Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> who&s;e length and breadth he gives us in &s;everal places directly, or by con&s;equence. What he tells us concernining <HI>Arbot|ka</HI> and the great Field without it, &s;ourrounded by the Sea he calls <HI>The Ratten Sea,</HI> is &s;carcely mentioned by any Modern Geographer, but wonderfully con&s;onant to what is delivered by <HI>Strabo. Arbotka</HI> &s;eems to be <HI>Taphre,</HI> the <HI>Ratten Sea,</HI> he calls <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Lacus Putris,</HI> and affirms to be part of the <HI>Palus Maeotis:</HI> in compa&s;s 4000 furlongs, with divers other particulars, confirming our Travellers Di&s;cour&s;e, as may be read at large in his &s;eventh Book. And I find in a Di&s;cour&s;e publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Thevenot</HI> concerning the <HI>Tartars,</HI> written lately by a Religious Mi&s;&s;ionary who long re&s;ided in tho&s;e parts, a De&s;cription of this place very &s;utable unto our Author.

<P>What our Author tells us of the Communication between the <HI>Tanais</HI> and <HI>Volga</HI> at <HI>Camu&s;shanka,</HI> is particularly de&s;cribed by <HI>Olearius,</HI> who wrote many years after him; who al&s;o agrees with us in his account of the Rivers of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Comukes</HI> Coun|trey: only our Writer is more punctual in his De&s;cription of their Sour&s;es and Cour&s;e, and mentions two or three omitted by <HI>Olearius,</HI> or unknow to him. A frequent mention is made by <HI>Procopious, Agathias,</HI> and others of the <HI>Bizantine</HI> Hi&s;torians, of that &s;trait pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Anadoule,</HI> or as they word it, between <HI>Colchis</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> or <HI>Armenia.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author having given an account of the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Volga,</HI> and of the mo&s;t remarkable places lying upon, or near it; at la&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, That it empties it &s;elf in|to the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea only by 22 Mouths, who&s;e names he there rehear&s;es: whereas other Writers a&s;cribe unto it 70 Entrances, though as <HI>Olearius</HI> judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, mo&s;t of them are rather pa&s;&s;ages made by the Sea between I&s;lands and broken Ground, than proper di&s;tinct Arms or Branches of the forementioned Rivers.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid concerning the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> retiring unto, and ne&s;ting in an I&s;land of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, is confirmed by a late <HI>French</HI> Writer, who long re&s;ided in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> He
<PB REF="324">
largely acquaints us with the great &s;poil the&s;e Outlaws made on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Me|&s;anderon,</HI> that they took <HI>A&s;terabath</HI> one of the Emperours Royal Stats, and having continued &s;everal days in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, retired with great Booty and little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I could render &s;ome probable account of tho&s;e Thieves our Writer calls <HI>Sigakes,</HI> of what Nation they are, when they began, and how they live; but &s;hall for brevity|&s;ake wave this and divers other Remarks; and that I may manife&s;t how impartial my &s;entiments are in reference unto the Treati&s;e <HI>I</HI> have here Publi&s;hed, I &s;hall fir&s;t ac|knowledge, That I never met with any Writer who calls that Va&s;t Plain between the Rivers <HI>Bori&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Tanais</HI> the De&s;art of <HI>Ingel</HI> and <HI>&V;ngul,</HI> although I have &s;een di|vers Journals both Antient and Modern, of Per&s;ons who have frequently traver&s;ed that va&s;t Region: and have read mo&s;t Hi&s;tories, and peru&s;ed Geographical Books or Tables that relate unto the <HI>Tartars,</HI> or their Countrey. Secondly, I mu&s;t declare my di&s;tru&s;t of his computation concerning the compa&s;s of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; which he makes le&s;s than in truth it is, as I could largely demon&s;trate; though he hath pretty well &s;alved the mi&s;take, by his allowance of a thou&s;and Miles for Bays, broken Ground, and Promontories. La&s;tly, Our Author is greatly mi&s;taken, when he affirms, There is no Nation of <HI>Tartars</HI> between tho&s;e of <HI>Bochara</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> whereas indeed &s;everal very Potent Kingdoms intervene. And yet he hath luckily <HI>Andabatorum more,</HI> hit up|on the Truth, where he a&s;&s;ures us, there are no <HI>Catayans</HI> between the <HI>&V;sbeg Tartars</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> For indeed there is at pre&s;ent no <HI>Catayne</HI> be&s;ides <HI>China,</HI> which is &s;o called by all <HI>Tartars, Per&s;ians, Arabians,</HI> and other <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> as al&s;o by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and other Nations who travel thither by Land, either in the Quality of Amba&s;&s;adors, or Merchants. Though formerly there was a mighty People, either <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Tartars</HI> (they bing both Originally the &s;ame, as to Extract, Language, Manners, Religion, and Government) who lay directly in the way between <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and were certainly the <HI>Chatae</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> but almo&s;t extirpated by <HI>Jingiz Chan,</HI> whom they vigo|rou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted. And the remainder have ever &s;ince gone under the more general Names of <HI>Mogulls</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> as <HI>I</HI> &s;hall hereafter more clearly and fully demon&s;trate in a Di&s;cour&s;e which <HI>I</HI> have long ago written, and may &s;peedily publi&s;h, concerning the Beginnings and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations and Empires.</P>

But they who arrived, finding the Town of great Compa&s;s, built only a Ca&s;tle on the Bank of the <HI>Nepper,</HI> and left 300 Men in Garri&s;on. At the &s;ame time <HI>Shaugary</HI> Prince of <HI>Crim,</HI> being beat out of his Countrey by his General <HI>Chan Timur Myr&s;a,</HI> retired unto the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> upon the <HI>Nepper,</HI> and having contracted a Friend&s;hip with them and the bordering <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gathered an Army of 40000 Men, and marched towards <HI>Crim,</HI> leaving behind him a revolted <HI>Ottoman,</HI> with a Brigade of 3 or 4000 Men, who im|mediately after the departure of Sultan <HI>Shaugary,</HI> marched directly towards <HI>A&s;lamgo|rod,</HI> and early in a Morning &s;urprized the Ca&s;tle, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> put every Man in Garri&s;on to the Sword, &s;lighted the Walls and other Fortifica|tions, retired with the Spoyl, and marched to joyn Sultan <HI>Shaugary,</HI> who in the interim arrived near <HI>Precop,</HI> where he was met by <HI>Chan Tunur,</HI> and totally defeated, but by good fortune e&s;caped, and by the way of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> got to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Nepper</HI> we will pa&s;s unto <HI>Crim,</HI> with which Countrey <HI>I</HI> am well acquain|ted, having again&s;t my will re&s;ided there &s;ome years. <HI>Crim</HI> is a &s;mall Land, &s;o near as <HI>I</HI> can conjecture 200 miles long, and 50 miles broad, but is wonderfully populous, and exceedingly fruitful, abounding with Corn and Gra&s;s; the only &s;carcity they have is Wood, which grows no where but upon the Sea-Coa&s;t, from <HI>Bak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ey Seray</HI> unto the Town of <HI>Crim,</HI> which in former times was the chief City: All the re&s;t of the Land is a Plain, where they have no Wood to burn, nor any &s;ort of Fewel, but <HI>Fi&s;&s;heke, Fu&s;&s;hane, Curay,</HI> and <HI>Stroa.</HI> The Land is inclo&s;ed with the Sea, excepting at two places, <HI>Precop,</HI> and <HI>Arbotka.</HI> By <HI>Precop</HI> there is a narrow pa&s;&s;age, through which you may go to the <HI>Nepper, Lithuania,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> through the De&s;arts of <HI>Ingul</HI> and <HI>&V;ngul,</HI> and there is a Water comes from the <HI>Teine</HI> Sea, called the &s;hallow Water, and goeth along the De&s;art, until it comes to <HI>Precop,</HI> upon the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Crim</HI> and by North, where it turns back on the North-&s;ide of <HI>Crim,</HI> and falls into <HI>Guellae Mare,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Ratten</HI> Sea. So that <HI>Crim</HI> is almo&s;t &s;urrounded with Water; for the <HI>Black</HI> Sea is on the one &s;ide, and the <HI>Ratten</HI> Sea on the other, which latter produces nothing but Salt, for it is &s;o &s;alt, that no Fi&s;h can live therein; <HI>I</HI> have rea&s;on to know it, becau&s;e <HI>I</HI> lived in a Village which was called <HI>Seekely Otta Mamutachy.</HI> The Towns round about <HI>Crim</HI> on the Sea-&s;ide are the&s;e, <HI>Precop, Cu&s;lowa, Crim, Caffa, Ker&s;e</HI> and <HI>Arbotka;</HI> and within the Land, <HI>Cara&s;u, Ackene&s;h, Me&s;heite,</HI> and <HI>Bake&s;&s;y Seray.</HI> The Town of <HI>Arbotka</HI> lieth on the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Crim,</HI> between the <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Ratten</HI> Seas, which there come &s;o near together, that there is no more Land between them, than that

This River is full of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially <HI>Sturgeons;</HI> well inhabited by <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> for there are &s;eldom le&s;s than 10000 upon it, be&s;ides tho&s;e that go on Freebooting. There are al&s;o 16 Gorodkees, or &s;trong Skonees, well manned, and with &s;tore of great Guns, they being in continual fear of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and &s;ometimes al&s;o of the <HI>Mu&s;|covites.</HI> The <HI>Little Nagoy,</HI> lies between the <HI>Tein</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Seas, the former on the We&s;t the latter on the Ea&s;t, <HI>Sherce&s;&s;an</HI> to South, and the <HI>Volga</HI> on the North; and there is never a Town in all this Countrey excepting <HI>A&s;&s;howa.</HI> It is inhabited by <HI>Tartars,</HI> who go altogether in Hords; their Prince in my Time was <HI>Ca&s;&s;ay Myr&s;a,</HI> whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> call al&s;o Sultan <HI>&V;lugh,</HI> or the Great Prince. They &s;owe no Corn but <HI>Pro&s;s,</HI> which they &s;owe upon the Sea-&s;ide up unto <HI>A&s;&s;howa;</HI> and after &s;owing they depart with their Hords, and graze up and down the De&s;arts to the <HI>Don,</HI> to <HI>Capbane, Shurpoha, Yedecul, Comma</HI> and <HI>Curray,</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;&s;hargorodoke,</HI> and to <HI>Sherca&s;&s;en</HI> Land, under the Rivers <HI>Terigke,</HI> and <HI>Balke,</HI> and almo&s;t to <HI>Pettigor,</HI> and by the River of <HI>Cupba,</HI> and back again unto the <HI>Black</HI> Sea. Thus they ramble all the Summer, until their Harve&s;t be ripe, and their Pro&s;s gathered, and put into Yams under ground; after which they &s;ettle from <HI>A&s;&s;howa,</HI> all along the Sea-&s;ide, among&s;t the Reeds, and leave their Hor&s;es to winter in the De&s;arts. So I &s;hall leave the <HI>Little Nagoy,</HI> and pa&s;s unto <HI>Temero&s;&s;a</HI> in <HI>Sherca&s;&s;en</HI> Land, which is 500 miles from <HI>A&s;&s;howa.</HI></P>
<P>Now in all <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> are but two Towns, <HI>Temero&s;&s;a</HI> on the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, upon the Gulf that goeth from the <HI>Black</HI> Sea into the <HI>Tein</HI> Sea, right over again&s;t <HI>Arbotka.</HI> The other is <HI>Tumein,</HI> upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, the di&s;tance between them being 1100 miles; and all the re&s;t of the inhabited Places are only Cubbacks made in the Woods, piled round with Timber. Their Hou&s;es are very high, in the mid&s;t whereof they make the Fire. Their Men are proper Men, very like the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> both for per&s;on and garb; for they go in Trow&s;es, with &s;hort Mantles, wear long Hair on both &s;ides of their Heads, with a &s;horn Crown between. Their Women are very beautiful, and loving to Strangers; for if a Stranger come unto their Hou&s;es, their young Women and Maidens will look Lice in their Shirts, and all about them, the mo&s;t private parts not excepted, and will allow them the liberty to examine and handle all parts of their Bodies be&s;ides their Brea&s;ts. The <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians</HI> are excellent Hor&s;emen, and very Couragious, but withal exceedingly ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious; for when they kill a Goat or Kid, they cut off the privy parts, and ca&s;t it again&s;t a Wall, if it &s;tick, they pray to it; if otherwi&s;e, they ca&s;t it away, and &s;pread the Skin upon Stakes, place it in their Corn-fields, and wor&s;hip it. They have no Writing among them, yet pretend to be good Chri&s;tians. Do &s;trangely bewail the Dead, making great Cryes, &s;cratch their Hands and Faces, until they draw much Blood, knock their Foreheads again&s;t the ground, until Knobs ari&s;e bigger than Plums. The Men are notorious Thieves, &s;tealing from each other, and he that &s;teals mo&s;t is ac|counted the brave&s;t Fellow. Their Countrey is very fruitful, abounding with mo&s;t &s;orts of Grain; and they have &s;tore of excellent Gra&s;s.

There is another River called <HI>Tumenka,</HI> which is a branch of <HI>Terigke,</HI> runs through <HI>Tumeine</HI> Town, and 3 miles beyond it enters the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. There is al&s;o another River which they call <HI>Kee&s;lar,</HI> which falls out of <HI>Terigke,</HI> and 60 miles from <HI>Tumeine</HI> is received by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>Having formerly mentioned <HI>Pettigor,</HI> I &s;hall give you &s;ome Account thereof. <HI>Petti|gor</HI> being interpreted, is in Engli&s;h, 5 Hills. They are five very great and high Moun|tains, di&s;tant about 500 miles from the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, and 700 from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> beyond <HI>Cabardy.</HI> I came thus to know them:</P>
<P>In the Year 1618. <HI>I</HI> was &s;ent with <HI>Shiedka Myr&s;a,</HI> from <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> to the <HI>Little Na|goy,</HI> to &s;eize upon <HI>Orrake Myr&s;a,</HI> who being informed of our coming, fled up to <HI>Petti|gor;</HI> yet he made not &s;uch ha&s;t but we overtook him, and having fought, overcame him, and took away his Hords, by which means <HI>I</HI> became acquainted with <HI>Pettigor.</HI> Neverthele&s;s there are higher Hills than <HI>Pettigor,</HI> as <HI>Snee&s;nagore</HI> in <HI>Cabardy,</HI> which is incredibly high, which is in Engli&s;h, the Hill of Snow; for upon that and <HI>Shadgore,</HI> which &s;ignifies a wonderful high Hill, and overtops the former, and &s;o along for 100 miles, from <HI>Cabardy</HI> to <HI>Shollohofe,</HI> prodigious quantities of Snow are lodged, which it's thought were never di&s;&s;olved &s;ince the Creation. <HI>I</HI> asked a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian,</HI> Whether ever any Man arrived at the top of <HI>Shadgore,</HI> which to me &s;eemed much elevated above the re&s;t; who an&s;wered me, They had a Tradition among them, that for|merly a <HI>Bohatteere,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Hroda,</HI> attempted to climb it, and after two or three days hard labour, arrived not unto the middle; but after a few days, being better accommodated, he returned, with a re&s;olution, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ee the top, but was never afterwards heard of; and added, That it was to that day cu&s;tomary for the Neighbouring <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the Year, with divers Ceremonies and great Lamentations to bewail his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Country to <HI>Sheerca&s;&s;en</HI> Land is <HI>Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> which is &s;ituated between <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mingrellia,</HI> and the inhabitants are a kind of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians. Mingrellia</HI> is under the Dominion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and lies on the <HI>Black</HI> Sea. Of the&s;e two Countreys, <HI>I</HI> have no great knowledge, having only coa&s;ted them three or four times in Boats, when <HI>I</HI> was among the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> where al&s;o we landed divers times, taking &s;tore of Kine and Sheep, but no Pri&s;oners, becau&s;e they affirmed them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians. They are a proper hand&s;ome People, but very poor, and notorious Thieves, for they &s;teal not only Goods, but even Women and Children from each other, and &s;ell them unto the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> chiefly for Salt, which is there very &s;carce.</P>
<P>Next unto <HI>Mingrellia</HI> is <HI>Georgia,</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants are little better than the former, only they have a kind of Scripture; for they Wor&s;hip Idols or Images, yet have Cloi&s;ters, and a &s;ort of Monks, with &s;ome Prie&s;ts of the Greek Belief. <HI>I</HI> once landed in <HI>Georgia</HI> with an Army of 5000 Men, we marched up into the Countrey; until we came within a days journey of <HI>Deimur Capon,</HI> or the Iron Gate, which is a narrow pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Anatolia,</HI> with Rocks on each &s;ide, and a &s;trong Town built in the mid&s;t: We &s;tayed ten days ravaging the Countrey; they told us, this Town and Ca&s;tle belonged to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and there is no other pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>Georgia</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> but through it.</P>
<P>The next Countrey unto <HI>Georgia</HI> is <HI>Anatolia,</HI> whereour Travel|ler re&s;ided &s;everal Years, having been &s;old by the <HI>Precopen&s;ian Tartars,</HI> unto a <HI>Turki&s;h Spahi,</HI> or <HI>Timariot;</HI> of which Countrey, and the Manners of the Inhabitants, he gives a large De&s;cription: But we being &s;ufficieintnly informed thereof by divers intelligent <HI>Euro|peans,</HI> who dwelt long in tho&s;e Parts, &s;hall with our Traveller pa&s;s on to tho&s;e Countreys which are le&s;s known. But fir&s;t we will take his Account of the <HI>Periplus</HI> of the <HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black</HI> Sea.</P>

From <HI>Fennara,</HI> which is at the head of the Strait or Gulf that enters the <HI>Black</HI> Sea to <HI>Precop,</HI> is 700 miles; from thence to <HI>Caffa,</HI> a noted City and Port in <HI>Crim</HI> 300 miles; to <HI>A&s;&s;howa</HI> 500 miles; to <HI>Temero&s;&s;a</HI> 500 miles; to <HI>Mingrelia</HI> 400 miles; to <HI>Trebezond</HI> 400 miles; and from thence unto <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> 1000 miles; in all 3800 miles. Thus much I know of the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, which I have three times coa&s;ted by Sea, and traced above half by Land; &s;o that now it is time to &s;peak concerning the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and &s;hew all the Kingdoms and Countreys which lie upon it, beginning at <HI>A&s;tra|can,</HI> and proceeding thence Ea&s;twards, until I return unto the &s;ame City from the South.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;tracan</HI> is placed on a ri&s;ing ground, not far from the mouth of the <HI>Volga,</HI> from which it is not di&s;tant above 50 miles; it is in an I&s;land on the <HI>Great Nagoy</HI> &s;ide, made by the River <HI>Volga,</HI> and a branch thereof, having the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea on the South. The Town or City is &s;ecured by a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, furni&s;hed with &s;tore of great Ordnance, and in the mid&s;t of the Ca&s;tle is a Roskade, which commands both Ca&s;tle, Town, and the Fields round about for above a mile. The <HI>Tartar</HI>'s Town is adjoyning, placed near unto <HI>Cutuma,</HI> which is a River naturally derived from the <HI>Volga,</HI> or one of its many branches; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o that the Town is incompa&s;&s;ed with Waters, having the main bo|dy of the <HI>Volga</HI> on the We&s;t, and <HI>Cutuma</HI> on the Ea&s;t. Now if you would know whence the <HI>Volga</HI> comes, I will acquaint you with what I have learned from the <HI>Mu&s;|covites.</HI> Its utmo&s;t Source is &s;aid to be at the foot of a great Tree, whence it runs un|to <HI>Jeri&s;lave</HI> 1000 miles; whence it proceeds to <HI>Nei&s;na</HI> 500 miles, and thence unto <HI>Ca&s;&s;an</HI> 300 miles; from <HI>Ca&s;&s;an</HI> to <HI>Samara</HI> 500; to <HI>Saratoft</HI> 350 miles; to <HI>Saraichena</HI> 350, and thence unto <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> 500 miles; from whence it is, as we &s;aid before, unto the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, 50 miles; in all 3550 miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Volga</HI> is a wonderful great River, abounding with divers &s;orts of great Fi&s;h, as <HI>Sturgeon Bellouke, Severuke, Shelren, Sterleke, Som, Sa&s;&s;an, Suke, Soudake, Konnee, Sablee, Le&s;&s;ee, Wobla, Tarane,</HI> and many others both great and &s;mall, which I cannot readily call unto remembrance, notwith&s;tanding that I dwelt there ten years. The <HI>Volga</HI> en|ters the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea by 22 mouths, and upon each of them is an <HI>Ough&s;uke</HI> or Fi&s;h-wear, for to take Sturgeon, every one of which <HI>Ough&s;ukes</HI> is called by the name of the Wa|ter, as <HI>Soellova, Dertullee, B &s;&s;erigee</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;lowa</HI> upon the main <HI>Wolga. Cokelou, Bee|rullee, Ewan&s;uke, Man&s;or, Argee&s;&s;an, Kee&s;&s;an, Camu&s;&s;huke, Naowara, Tu&s;&s;ockly, Collobery, Malla Collobery, Yaman&s;uke, Eirich&s;ha, Surka, Libe&s;ha, Bu&s;&s;an, Carabu&s;&s;an, Bealla Wollo&s;|kee.</HI> In all which <HI>Ougb&s;ukes</HI> or Wears, they take no Fi&s;h be&s;ides Sturgeon. They are made of <HI>Shigenas,</HI> or long Poles made &s;harp at one end, and beaten into the ground un|der Water, and a pleiting made of Rods, &s;omwhat re&s;mbling O&s;ier, after the man|ner of our Matts, which are fa&s;tened to the Poles, and hinder the Fi&s;h from pa&s;&s;ing up the River. And Hou&s;es are built neat the Wears for the Conveniency of the Fi&s;hers, 40, 50, more or le&s;s, according unto the greatne&s;s of the Water, or re&s;ort of Fi&s;h, and twice every day, u&s;ually in the morning and evening, they &s;et about their Fi&s;hery. They imploy only long &s;lender Poles with an Iron Hook or Cruke in the end baited, and do ordinarily take 400 every day in the &s;maller, and 600 in the larger Streams. The Sturgeon they take is all &s;alted, excepting that wherewith they &s;erve the Town of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> where a whole fair Sturgeon may be bought for ten pence Engli&s;h; and when the great Caravan comes from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> it takes off mo&s;t of their Fi&s;h, which is conveyed into dives parts of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> but chiefly unto the great City of <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> They re|turn al&s;o with great quantities of Caviar and Salt, there being not far from the <HI>Volga,</HI> on the <HI>Little Nagoy</HI> &s;ide, great Salt-pits, which yield an immen&s;e quantity of Salt, pre|pared yearly by the heat of the Sun, without any further trouble, than taking it off the &s;uperficies of the Water where it daily kerns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Volga</HI> a little above <HI>Seraichena,</HI> 500 miles from <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;es a great Branch named <HI>Actabon,</HI> which pa&s;&s;ing through the De&s;art of the <HI>Great Nagoy</HI> through <HI>Ba&s;&s;ane,</HI> enters the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. The remainder of the <HI>Volga,</HI> after having parted with &s;everal &s;maller Branches, mo&s;t of which joyn with the forementioned River, divides the <HI>Little</HI> and <HI>Great Nagoy,</HI> pa&s;&s;es under the Town of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> whence it proceeds unto <HI>Ru&s;lowa,</HI> on the South we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Cro&s;na B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ggar,</HI> and then falls into the <HI>Ca&s;pian.</HI> And the di&s;tance between the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Volga</HI> near <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and the River <HI>Acta|bon,</HI> is about 20 miles, which is mo&s;tly Water and I&s;lands.</P>
<P>And that the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Volga</HI> from its fir&s;t Source, until it doth di&s;-embouge it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, can be no le&s;s than what we have a&s;&s;erted, is hence confirmed;
<PB N="106" REF="327">
That the Snow which falls abundantly in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and begins to be di&s;&s;olved about the latter end <HI>April,</HI> and do mighily increa&s;e the Waters of the <HI>Volga,</HI> come not unto <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> until <HI>Mid&s;ummer,</HI> when it &s;o rai&s;es the <HI>Volga,</HI> that overflowing the Banks, it covers with his Waters all the I&s;lands near <HI>A&s;trachan;</HI> &s;o that from the <HI>Little Nagoy,</HI> un <HI>Actabon</HI> in the <HI>Great Nagoy,</HI> all the Coutries &s;eems, excepting a Hillock or two, one continued Lake, or a great Gulf of the Sea. Wherefore they who go in the <HI>Spring</HI> from <HI>Ar&s;tachan</HI> to fetch Wood, having cut it, make great Floats, which are li&s;ted up when the River overflows, and guided each by a few Men, until they are brought unto <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> or tho&s;e other places for which they are de&s;igned.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Towns and Habitations upon the <HI>Volga,</HI> between <HI>Seraichena</HI> and <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> (which are 500 miles di&s;tant from each other) are <HI>Camena, Rokegowa, O&s;&s;henofka, Chornoyar, Bori&s;&s;e, Offatalka, Poollowoy, Collmakof Satone, Co&s;&s;oyar, Cro&s;noyar, Na&s;&s;onoyar, Satone, Yanatavy, Daneelofka, Perre Ou&s;&s;hake, Eillan&s;uke, Eiskyborro, Crukla, Bu&s;&s;an, Bal&s;heeke, Tollotongorod, Dolgoa, Goradocha,</HI> (which was old <HI>A&s;trachan) Sharinae, Bogar,</HI> which is near <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> be&s;ides many other Places, with who&s;e Names I have not charged my memory. We will now pa&s;s over the <HI>Volga</HI> through <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> into the <HI>Great Nagoy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Nagoy</HI> may be properly enough divided into I&s;lands and Continent; the former are made by the <HI>Volga,</HI> and &s;everal Rivers which fall out of it, variou&s;ly mix'd with each other, and are all at length emptied into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. Tho&s;e Rivers or Brances have their &s;everal Names; tho&s;e which <HI>I</HI> remember are <HI>Cuttoma, Boulda, Mal|la, Guellu&s;a, Creewantya, Bu&s;ane, Actabon</HI> and <HI>Bereket.</HI> The Kingdom of the <HI>Great Na|goy</HI> is all plain and de&s;ert; 1200 miles in length between <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and <HI>Semara;</HI> 500 miles in breadth from the &s;aid <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> unto the River of the <HI>Yeike</HI> or <HI>Jaick.</HI> There is no wood in all this Countrey, except what grows near the Rivers. It hath no Towns or fixed Habitations, though it had formerly divers, and &s;ome among them very con&s;iderable, as <HI>Czarofsgorod,</HI> or <HI>Czarofs Pollate,</HI> in Engli&s;h, the Emperour's Town, which formerly mu&s;t needs have been as its name imports, an Imperial or Ca|pital City. I have often viewed it with admiration, and connot compute it to have been le&s;s than 20 miles in Circuit; <HI>I</HI> have told four&s;core great eminent Buildings, which mu&s;t have been either <HI>Mo&s;chees, Pallaces,</HI> or <HI>Caravan&s;eries,</HI> and &s;ome of them 6 miles di&s;tant from the other. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are of divers Opinions concerning its De&s;truction: Some &s;ay it was ruined by the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks;</HI> but the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> who are rea|dy enough to brag of Atchievements, know nothing thereof, only that they have often di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> when they endeavoured to rebuild part of it. For in|deed the &s;ituation is very excellent, having the <HI>Volga</HI> on one &s;ide, and the <HI>Actabon</HI> on the other: The Countrey very beautiful, healthful and fertile; and yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e encouragements, it is not yet inhabited, not by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> becau&s;e it &s;tanding on the main Land, they would be continually expo&s;ed unto the Inroads of the <HI>Tar|tars;</HI> nor by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> becau&s;e its nearne&s;s unto the Rivers, would render them ob|noxious to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> every time the great Caravan pa&s;&s;es that way, which is at lea&s;t twice each year. Yet the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do frequently fetch Brick and Stones from this ruined City, wherewith they have built a great part of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and the neighbour|in Forts or Towns, where &s;uch &s;olid Materials are imployed. But be&s;ides this <HI>Serai,</HI> (for &s;o the <HI>Tartars</HI> call any fix'd Habitation) there were in ancient times five or &s;ix more down along the Rivers &s;ide, in each of which formerly dwelt a <HI>Chan;</HI> but Time and Wars have almo&s;t intirely ruined them. There is al&s;o another <HI>Serai</HI> upon the River <HI>Jaick</HI> named <HI>Seraichika,</HI> where is &s;aid formerly to have been the Re&s;idence of a great <HI>Myr&s;a</HI> or <HI>Chan;</HI> but 'tis now quite ruinated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tarters</HI> who inhabit the <HI>Great Nagoy,</HI> both Men and Women, are very proper, at lea&s;t of much taller Stature than many other <HI>Tartars,</HI> but have ill-favoured Counte|nances, broad Faces, flat little No&s;es, &s;mall Eyes &s;unk in their Heads, all which are common to mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern <HI>Tartars.</HI> But the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Crim</HI> are more comely, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, may partely proceed from their Wives, who are many of them Cap|tive <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians, Ru&s;&s;es, Poles, Hungars,</HI> and of divers other Nations. The <HI>Nagoy Tar|tars</HI> are al&s;o Black or rather Tawny; which I Conjecture is not &s;o much natural, as
<PB N="107" REF="327">
proceeding from the heat of the Sun, which is in the&s;e Parts &s;ome Months of the Year much more exce&s;&s;ive than one would expect from the Climate. And be&s;ides, their Children go &s;tark naked during the great heats in Summer. It is al&s;o re|markable, That the Cold in Winter in the &s;ame Country is exceeding &s;evere, and one would think to them who have &s;uch mean accommodation, intollerable. The&s;e <HI>Nagoy Tartars</HI> have great &s;tore of Cattle, as Kine, Sheep, Hor&s;es and Camels, and yet notwith&s;tanding they are verv ill clad, mo&s;t of their Cloathing being Sheep-Skins, and tho&s;e but &s;curvily dre&s;&s;ed. They have no &s;ort of Corn or Grain, mightily &s;corning the <HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who&s;e chief Diet they &s;ay, is the top of a pitiful weed. Poligamy is not only allowed, but altogether in fa&s;hion among them, mo&s;t having divers Wives, more or fewer according unto their Quality and Ability; who unle&s;s they are Captivated by War, are &s;uch as they buy of their Parents or Kindred for Cattle. If one Brother dye, the other takes all his Wives, who are u&s;ually five or &s;ix. But if all the Brothers die, either in War or by Di&s;ea&s;es, then they are devolved like other Goods or Chattels unto the Elder Brother's Son, they never &s;uffering any married Woman, during life, to go out of the Kindred.</P>
<P>Here our Author hath in&s;erted a Di&s;cour&s;e concerning divers odd, and &s;ome barbarous Cu&s;toms which have long prevailed among the <HI>Nagoy-Tartars,</HI> and wherewith they will not ea&s;ily Di&s;pence. But they giving little light unto Hi&s;tory or Geography, I have not thought them worthy the trouble of tran&s;cribing; nor do I apprehend they would afford any con&s;iderable in&s;truction or diverti&s;ement unto the Reader.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> of the Great <HI>Nagoy</HI> when they remove their habitation, tran&s;port their Hou&s;es from place to place in Waggons with four Wheels, which are drawn u&s;ually by Camels; they pa&s;s up and down the Country in great Hords, their ordinary march is from the <HI>Volga</HI> unto <HI>Buskow&s;hake;</HI> thence to <HI>Voro&s;lane, Semara, Eirgee&s;&s;e, Ei&s;hene, Ougogra, Reimpeska,</HI> and all along under the <HI>Calmukes</HI> Country, until they arrive at the <HI>Jaick</HI> or <HI>Yeike:</HI> Sometimes they pa&s;s by <HI>Ca&s;&s;oone, Aurrow, Camoyes Samar,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Saraichika:</HI> this is ordinarily their Summer Progre&s;s. Again&s;t Winter they return unto tho&s;e parts of the Countrey which border upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. As <HI>Baksake</HI> upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; <HI>Beallan&s;ia, Kitgach, Sheennamara, Coudake, Caradowan, Actabon;</HI> and higher upon the <HI>Volga,</HI> &s;cattering them&s;elves upon the Sea-&s;hore and Banks of the Rivers among the Reeds and Woods, or where&s;oever they find the Climate mo&s;t mild and be&s;t defence again&s;t the Cold, which in the Winter is in the&s;e Parts extremely Severe; &s;o that 'tis hard to determine whether they &s;uffer more from the Heat in Summer, or Cold in Winter. During which latter Sea&s;on they leave their Hergels or Hor&s;es, and mo&s;t of their greater Cattle to &s;hift for them&s;elves in the De&s;erts.</P>
<P>Having often had occa&s;ion to mention the River <HI>Jaicke</HI> or <HI>Yeike,</HI> I &s;hall here give a &s;hort Account of what I have ob&s;erved and learnt concerning its Ri&s;e and Cour&s;e. It comes from the <HI>Calmukes</HI> Land, where it is thought to &s;pring; though &s;ome of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> affirm its Fountains are more Remote in <HI>Siberia,</HI> the Southern parts of which is al&s;o inhabited if not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Kalmukes,</HI> &s;ome of who&s;e <HI>Vlu&s;&s;es</HI> or Hords are &s;ubject unto the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> others in League with them: but they have &s;ometimes cruel Wars, and did formerly de&s;troy <HI>Tumen</HI> with &s;ome other Towns and Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> who they apprehended did incroach too fa&s;t upon them. But to return unto the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Yeick,</HI> after it hath pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Calmukes</HI> Country, it divides the Great <HI>Nagoy</HI> from <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda,</HI> and after it hath pa&s;&s;ed in all a Thou|&s;and miles, throws it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea a little below <HI>Seraichika.</HI> This is a very large River, and the Land on each &s;ide well cloathed with Wood, Gra&s;s, divers &s;orts of Herbs and wild Fruits, and the Water full of good Fi&s;h; which Convenien|ces do oft-times invite the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> to make their abode there, and from thence they make Incur&s;ions on divers parts bordering on the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. This River, among

divers other Fi&s;h doth &s;o wonderfully abound with Sturgeon, that a man may &s;tand upon the Bank &s;ide with a Pole in hand arm'd at the end with an Iron Crook, make choice of what Sturgeon be&s;t plea&s;eth him, which he &s;hall rarely &s;aid of taking though never &s;o inexpert in Fi&s;hing, if he have but &s;trength or help to draw it on Land. Not far from the Mouth of the <HI>Jeick</HI> in the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea near the Shore, are many Coves and Corners which they call <HI>Lapateens</HI> and <HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nkes,</HI> which are always full of Swans u&s;ually &s;wimming on the Sea, which are &s;o numerous, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to make any rea&s;onable Computation thereof. The&s;e Swans after Mid&s;ummer every Year ca&s;t their Feathers, a little before which time there parts from <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> many Boats which are manned by <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> and mo&s;t of them are their Youth; after a pa&s;&s;age of five hundred miles they arrive at the&s;e places which the Swans mo&s;tly haunt, and having filled their Boats with Swans Skins and Feathers, they return unto <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> where a great Trade is driven with the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who give ordinarily a Dollar apiece for the&s;e Skins.</P>
<P>The next Countrey unto the Great <HI>Nagoy</HI> towards the Ea&s;t is <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda,</HI> which hath, as I &s;aid, on the We&s;t the <HI>Jaick,</HI> by which it is divided from the Great <HI>Nagoy.</HI> On the North the <HI>Kalmukes,</HI> North-Ea&s;t the <HI>Yurgeach,</HI> or <HI>Jurgench-Tartars,</HI> and to the South the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea and <HI>Caragans,</HI> who inhabit on the North-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. The&s;e <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Tatars</HI> march up and down the Country much after the manner of the <HI>Nagays.</HI> They have frequent Wars with the <HI>Kalmukes</HI> and <HI>Yurgeachians;</HI> but &s;eldome with either <HI>Nagoys</HI> or <HI>Caragans.</HI> Only after the manner of mo&s;t other <HI>Tartars,</HI> they will clande&s;tinely &s;teal even from tho&s;e Neighbours with whom they have the mo&s;t uninterrupted and profound Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda</HI> is altogether De&s;art, excepting &s;ome Woods Northward, bordering upon the <HI>Kolmukes,</HI> where more are divers &s;mall Rivers which empty them&s;elves into the <HI>Jaick;</HI> which River is al&s;o in mo&s;t places bordered with Woods unto its Entrance into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. And therefore the Inhabitants may well be named <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda,</HI> or wild People, as the Name imports: They &s;ow no &s;ort of Corn, their chief Food being Hor&s;e fle&s;h and Mares milk; which is al&s;o common to divers other Nations of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>On the North of <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda</HI> dwell the <HI>Kalmuke Tartars,</HI> if &s;uch a life as they lead may be called dwelling. The Country they inhabit de&s;erves a better People, the Land abounding with all things nece&s;&s;ary for a Comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This Country hath &s;tore of Sables, Marterus, Black Foxes, Squerrils, and &s;everal other &s;orts of Furs, which they Exchange with the <HI>Ruffes</HI> for Aqua-vitae, Mead, Tobacco, and other Commodities. This Country hath &s;ome Towns, as <HI>Siberiae,</HI> the Head of a Province of the &s;ame Name, and <HI>Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">een,</HI> both which the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> have gained from them: <HI>Ouffba, Wadle, Sellona, Lncomoria,</HI> which latter place, they &s;ay, is &s;ituated upon a Cold Sea. But <HI>Ouffha</HI> is a midland Town, 500 miles from <HI>Ca&s;&s;an</HI> which is near the <HI>Volga.</HI> The <HI>Kalmukes</HI> are accounted good Souldiers, being kegt in con|tinual Exerci&s;e by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> on the one &s;ide, the <HI>Nagoyans</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy-Horda</HI> on the other. Their unmarried Women do not only accompany the Men unto the Wars, but are &s;aid to be little inferiour unto the Men in Skill and Valour, &s;hooting almo&s;t as &s;trongly and dexterou&s;ly as the men, from whom they cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Garb, being apparelled and riding much after the &s;ame manner: Both Men and Women in all their Expeditions &s;eldome carry along with them fewer than five or &s;ix Hor&s;es apiece. I cannot preci&s;ely determine what their Religion is, but I do perceive by Conver&s;e with them, that they have a more favourable Opinion of the Chri&s;tiansithan of the Mahumetans, or of &s;ome of their fellow <HI>Ethnicks:</HI> for if I mi&s;take not, they are Heathens, I not being able to di&s;cern among them any Religious Wor&s;hip, excepting &s;ome kind of Ado|ration which they pay unto the Sun and Moon. They have a very peculiar kind of Diet for be&s;ides Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, which is a great Dainty, they &s;cruple not to eat Snakes, Adders, Foxes, and indeed even Carrion of divers &s;orts of Creatures, &s;uch Food as to <HI>Europeans</HI> would be intollerable, even in the greate&s;t Famine. They wear a kind of Caps or Hats which are called by the <HI>Mu&s;covites, Coulpackes,</HI> open before and behind; with broad Brims on each &s;ide. And thereupon they are called by the other <HI>Tartars, Colmukes.</HI></P>

Ea&s;tward from the&s;e <HI>Calmukes,</HI> inclining unto the South towards <HI>China,</HI> live the <HI>Yurgeachians,</HI> &s;o named from their chief Town, which &s;ome call <HI>Yurgeach,</HI> others <HI>Jur|gench:</HI> Of which Country I cannot &s;ay &s;o much as concerning the former, having never been therein but once; for in the Year 1620 there being great Wars in <HI>Jurge|ach,</HI> between the <HI>Chan</HI> or King, and the <HI>Myr&s;a</HI> his Son; &s;ome of the <HI>Nagoy Tartars</HI> hearing thereof, invaded the Country, who whil&s;t they were united, dur&s;t not peep out of their own Borders, the <HI>Jurgeachians</HI> being a numerous and warlike People. The&s;e <HI>Nagoys</HI> were all Volunteers, who went without any Command from their own Prince, or Allowance from the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> without who&s;e con&s;ent by mutual Agree|ment they are not permitted to War. The News of their Expedition being brought unto <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> the <HI>Voyvoad</HI> who had not long before made a League with the <HI>Jurge|achians,</HI> &s;ent out <HI>Allye</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e his true Name was <HI>Ali</HI> or <HI>Hali) Myr&s;a</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince, with a Thou&s;and of his own Subjects, and Five Hundred <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> all Hor&s;e.

We took all their Booty from them; and as a further puni&s;hment for their Riot, took away their own &s;upernumerary Hor&s;es, leaving them only a Hor&s;e a Man for to convey them home. Then <HI>Ally Myr&s;a</HI> divided the Spoil, half he be|&s;towed upon tho&s;e who did accompany him, and &s;ent the remainder for a Pre&s;ent unto the <HI>Voyvod,</HI> returning nothing unto the <HI>Jurgeachians,</HI> becau&s;e they were taken from Thieves. In the mean while the Prince of <HI>Jurgeach</HI> in a pitcht Battel over|threw his Father, took him Pri&s;oner, put out both his Eyes, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be Crowned King. He had a younger Brother, whom fearing that in time he might occa&s;ion &s;ome In&s;urrection, he gave Command unto &s;ome of his Creatures, that they &s;hould &s;trangle him, and bring his Head: But divers of the Nobles, by who&s;e means he obtained the Soveraignty, gaining intelligence thereof, would not permit his Order to be put in execution; but &s;eizing on the Child, &s;ent him unto the Emperour <HI>Mue&s;ovy,</HI> with whom he remained when I was la&s;t at <HI>A&s;tracan.</HI></P>

<P>The Country of the <HI>Caragans</HI> occupies mo&s;t of that va&s;t &s;pace, which interceeds between the River <HI>Yeike</HI> and the Dominions of the <HI>Ousbegs,</HI> or <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bouchara,</HI> and their Territory &s;urrounds the North-Ea&s;t corner of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, proceeding Southwards unto the River <HI>Jaxartes;</HI> and &s;ome Hords of the &s;aid People do inhabit between the &s;aid River and the <HI>Oxus,</HI> which divides the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bochara</HI> and the <HI>Caragans,</HI> from the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bulk.</HI> This Country of the <HI>Caragans</HI> is very de&s;art and barren; the People mi&s;erably Poor; their Hou&s;es are wretched Huts, the greate&s;t part under ground; they are very tawny and ill-favour'd; their Habitations are &s;catter'd, &s;carcely de&s;erving the Name of Villages: And they have no Town, as I have been informed, be&s;ides <HI>Prees&s;lames,</HI> which is &s;ituated on the South|&s;ide of the <HI>Juxartes,</HI> near the <HI>Ca&s;pran</HI> Sea; which whil&s;t I dwelt in <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> was by &s;urprize taken by the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> but they had little cau&s;e to brag of their Victory, finding little booty therein; and the <HI>Caragans</HI> gath'ring together, beat them our with great lo&s;s of Men, forcing them to retire into an I&s;land two or three Leagues from the Land, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s unto this day, no Nation being able, or el&s;e not caring to un-ne&s;t them, although <HI>Tartars, Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> do continually &s;uffer by their Depredations.</P>
<P>Towards the Ea&s;t and by South of the <HI>Caragans,</HI> dwell the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bochara,</HI> who are by divers called <HI>Yusbegs.</HI> The Country which they po&s;&s;e&s;s is better watred, and more fertile than mo&s;t of the preceeding, and there is great re&s;ort of Merchants from divers Parts unto them, e&s;pecially <HI>Per&s;ians, Mu&s;covites,</HI> and &s;everal Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> as <HI>Moguls, Boutans,</HI> with many others, who&s;e Names I cannot recollect. I have been
<PB N="110" REF="329">
al&s;o told, That the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do &s;ometimes trade with them. I am per&s;waded, that this is the famed Kingdom of <HI>Cataye;</HI> for the <HI>Catayans</HI> are a &s;ort of <HI>Tartars,</HI> and I know no other <HI>Tartars</HI> between this Country and <HI>China.

They are almo&s;t continually in Wars with the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>The next Country I am to de&s;cribe is <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in which Land I was never, excepting once, in that part thereof which borders upon the <HI>Comukes;</HI> but I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchants at <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> who came by Shipping from <HI>Gilan,</HI> which when the Wind is very fair and good, they &s;ail in two or three days and Nights. They wear Turbants like the <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;o do the <HI>Bouchars.</HI> Therefore not having &s;een much of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor having &s;ufficiently informed my &s;elf concerning it, I &s;hall pa&s;s through it unto the <HI>Comukes</HI> Land, of which I have obtained more perfect know|ledge both by War and Traffick. This Country is bounded on the South by <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> on the Ea&s;t by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; We&s;tward by <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia;</HI> and on the North by the River of <HI>Tumeine;</HI> on which &s;tands a Town of the &s;ame Name, from which unto <HI>Chahamate,</HI> the mo&s;t Northerly Habitation of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is 600 miles A great part of this Country, e&s;pecially We&s;tward, is very mountainous; I could never learn where it doth exactly Terminate. <HI>I</HI> have been in four of their Towns: The fir&s;t is <HI>Tarkee,</HI> where <HI>Gildar,</HI> whom they own for their Prince, doth ordinarily re&s;ide. The &s;econd is <HI>Derbeine,</HI> in the Mountains. The third <HI>Derevena,</HI> in the &s;ame mountainous Tract. The fourth <HI>Ko&s;&s;a,</HI> upon a River of the &s;ame Name, not far from the place where it empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. The&s;e <HI>Comukes</HI> are proper Men and very couragious; and that which makes them more daring and adventurous than mo&s;t <HI>Tartars,</HI> is the goodne&s;s of their Hor&s;es, and the advantage of their Arms, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive; for they &s;eldome engage in Wars without Helmets, Jacks of Steel, Shirts of Mail, and Targets, which excepting tho&s;e times wherein they fight, hang behind their backs, being very light, and not very large, and therefore not cumber&s;ome. They have, as other <HI>Tartars,</HI> both Bows and Cymetars, and withal never go without Lances, which they u&s;e with great &s;trength and dexterity. In their Apparel they differ little from the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians;</HI> but as for Religion, they are generally <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and their Language is in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame with other <HI>Tartars,</HI> their vicinity unto the <HI>Per&s;ians, Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Sheerca&s;&s;es,</HI> having &s;omewhat di&s;gui&s;ed it. The Countrey they inhabit abounds with Wood; part of it is hilly, with &s;mall plea&s;ant Valleys between the Hillocks; and in &s;ome places, e&s;pecially towards <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and thence into the Land, it hath many great and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains, by rea&s;on of their heighth and &s;teepne&s;s. This Land was reduced under the Government of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> many years ago, after the en|&s;uing manner: <HI>Evan Va&s;&s;ilywich</HI> being <HI>Czar</HI> or Emperour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> after he had taken <HI>Ca&s;&s;an</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> &s;ent part of his Army into <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> where they took in <HI>Tumeine.</HI> Another Body entred the <HI>Comukes</HI> Country, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of <HI>Derevena, Derbeine, Tarkee</HI> and <HI>Ko&s;&s;a.</HI> The <HI>Ru&s;&s;e</HI> Emperour con&s;tituted a <HI>Voyvod,</HI> whom he ordered to re&s;ide in <HI>Tarkee,</HI> and left with him 10000 Men; he ordered al&s;o at the &s;ame time another con&s;iderable Brigade to &s;tay at <HI>Coi&s;a,</HI> where he left a great number of Boats and other Ve&s;&s;els, who had brought &s;upplies of Men and Provi&s;i|ons from <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and other Parts of his Dominions. And having, as he appre|hended, &s;ecured his new Conque&s;ts, he returned unto <HI>Mo&s;co:</HI> Immediately after his retreat, the <HI>Comukes</HI> gather'd their whole Force, and &s;et down before the Town of <HI>Tarkee,</HI> which after a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance they took, and in it with the <HI>Voyvod,</HI> &s;everal Officers of divers Nations, whom with the common Souldiers they &s;old unto the <HI>Cir|ca&s;&s;ians, Tartars,</HI> and other neighb'ring Nations, &s;o that few were ever afterwards re|cover'd. From <HI>Tarkee</HI> they marched unto <HI>Koi&s;a,</HI> which by the in&s;truction of Cap|tives they did pretty regularly be&s;iege and a&s;&s;ault, and after &s;ome repul&s;es took it by &s;torm, killing all the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> excepting &s;uch as e&s;caped in the Ships and Boats which lay before the Town. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;e</HI> Emperour being &s;peedily informed of the&s;e Succe&s;|&s;es, immediately rai&s;ed a great Army, with which he ordered all the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> between the <HI>Don</HI> and 
<HI>Volga,</HI> unto the River of <HI>Tumeine,</HI> to joyn his Forces, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in order unto the recovery of what he had lo&s;t, and utter extirpation of the <HI>Comukes:</HI> Who hearing how highly the <HI>Czar</HI> was exa&s;perated, and how great a Force was ready to invade them, they began to be &s;olicitous about the Event; and having con&s;ulted

together agreed to make &s;ome kind of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ue for pardon and peace. Whereupon they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors unto <HI>Temeine,</HI> where the <HI>Ru&s;&s;e</HI> Army was encamp|ed; and after a Treaty with the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Plenipotentaries, they agreed upon the&s;e Ar|ticles, That the <HI>Comukes</HI> &s;hould re&s;tore the Towns they had taken, and aid the Empe|rour with &s;uch a number of Souldiers, as he &s;hould require, again&s;t any Enemy what|&s;oever, whereunto their Heads being Sworn, they have inviolably ob&s;erved the Agree|ment unto this day. But it's time we take our leave of <HI>Gildar,</HI> Prince of <HI>Terki,</HI> and his <HI>Comukes,</HI> and proceed into <HI>Sherca&s;&s;en</HI> Land, part of which as I hinted before, lyes upon the Black Sea, and extends it &s;elf unto the <HI>Ca&s;pian.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ide of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> which borders upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, is a very plentiful Coun|trey; and as for Fi&s;h, it is &s;o wonderfully plentiful, that in <HI>Tumeine</HI> you may ordina|rily purcha&s;e a good Sturgeon for two pence, and &s;ometimes for a penny; a mo&s;t pro|digious quantity of Fi&s;h being taken in the River of the <HI>Wee&s;tra,</HI> and about the I&s;land of <HI>Chekiene,</HI> which is off at Sea not far from <HI>Tumeine.</HI> On the main Land, over again&s;t this Fi&s;hery, 4 miles above the River of <HI>Terike,</HI> there is a great Well, made by a Spring, which falls from a Rock, on the &s;ide of a great Hill, and immediately fills this Little Lake, which whether it is Natural or Artificial, <HI>I</HI> know not. The Water of this Lake is &s;o &s;calding hot, that the Fi&s;hers flinging in their Sturgeon or other Fi&s;h, it is in a &s;hort time boyled, as if over a fire, the heat being &s;o inten&s;e, that no Man can detain his hand in it for a moment; from which &s;trange Quality it derives its Name, being called by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es, Goracha Colloda,</HI> or the Scalding Well.</P>

<P>There is a &s;ort of people in this Countrey, whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> call <HI>Sigakes;</HI> I could never learn what their language is, or from what Place or Nation they proceed; nor could <HI>I</HI> under&s;tand after what manner they live, whether they have any Religion, or Civil Government. Their chief Sub&s;i&s;tance is what they gain from the <HI>Tartars;</HI> for they gather &s;omtimes 2 or 3000, and rob the &s;maller Hords of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t remote from help. But &s;ometimes the <HI>Tartars</HI> di&s;covering the place of their Retreat or Rendevous, &s;urround them with their Carts, and then fall in, cut them all off, never giving Quarter unto any; no Crime being &s;o &s;everly puni&s;hed among&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as Thievery; which makes me apprehend, that the&s;e <HI>Sigakes</HI> are &s;ome of their own people, who formerly de&s;erted them upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ion: But what&s;oever is the rea&s;on, they do mo&s;t irreconcileably hate each the other.</P>

<P>Having pre&s;ented your Lord&s;hip with a &s;hort but true Account of tho&s;e Countries encompa&s;&s;ing and lying between the two forementioned <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Seas, I &s;hall no le&s;s briefly and faithfully declare by what Accidents <HI>I</HI> came unto this Knowledge: which co&s;t me &s;o dear, that <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive per&s;on would not purcha&s;e the gratification of his Curio&s;ity at a far lels Expence of time and trouble, than <HI>I</HI> have imployed (though often again&s;t my will) in my Travels and Enquires.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> was born <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Extract: my Family Noble, but my E&s;tate not corre&s;ponding with my Quality, being ambitious, and withal naturally inclined to &s;ee Forraign Countries, I hoped to Rai&s;e my Fortune by my Sword. After <HI>I</HI> left <HI>Ireland,</HI> before <HI>I</HI> had been long in <HI>England,</HI> an opportunity pre&s;enting it &s;elf, I engaged in the Service of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had then Wars with the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> having given &s;ome Con&s;iderable proofs of my Courage, I was gradually rai&s;ed unto a Con&s;iderable Command; but being engaged too far in a Body of the Enemies, I was unhappily taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> and carried Pri&s;oner unto <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cow,</HI> then in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, ha|ving at the &s;ame time Arrears due unto me from the <HI>Swede</HI> above 5000 Dollars. The <HI>Swedes</HI> taking no care for my Enlargement, being willing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;ave &s;o great a Sum of Money, as at my Return <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have challenged: after Three years clo&s;e Impri&s;onment, I was profered Liberty by the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> upon condition I would faith|fully &s;erve him again&s;t all his Enemies; whereunto a&s;&s;enting, I was &s;ent unto <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and there before the Chancellor &s;worn a <HI>Tolmack</HI> and preferred unto a Command lit|tle inferiour unto what I enjoyed before. And the <HI>Poles</HI> advancing towards <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> with a great Army, fearing le&s;t I &s;hould go over unto them, I was &s;ent unto <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> where I remained 10 years, being continually Employed again&s;t the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Circa&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ans.</HI> By which means I came to know <HI>Pettigor, Snee&s;nagor, Shadgore, Cabardye,</HI> and the Great and Little <HI>Nagoy,</HI> the <HI>Comukes,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;&s;en,</HI> the <HI>Kalmukes, Ca&s;&s;achy, Horda, Caragans, &V;ngen&s;h,</HI> and <HI>&V;sbeg Tartars.</HI> During which Wars, I conflicted with great difficulties and hard&s;hip; in making long Journies, faring hardly: Nor was it a &s;mall labour to make floates in order unto our pa&s;&s;ing over the great Rivers <HI>I</HI> have mentioned, to &s;ay nothing of the Danger. Be&s;ides, we run great hazards in our Jour|neying over tho&s;e wa&s;te wide howling De&s;arts, which on every &s;ide &s;urrounded us; fre|quently wanting provi&s;ions, and &s;omtimes Guides; &s;o that had we failed never &s;o little in our Conjectures, we had all peri&s;hed. After Ten years hard Service, in my Return from Conveying <HI>Shollohofe Knez</HI> into <HI>Sherca&s;&s;en</HI> Land, I was taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Tartars</HI> of the Little <HI>Nagoy,</HI> and by them carried unto <HI>A&s;&s;owa</HI> upon the Mouth of the <HI>Tana</HI> or <HI>Don.</HI> There I was &s;ould unto a <HI>Precopen&s;ian Tartar,</HI> who carried me along with him towards <HI>Crim:</HI> But upon the &s;hallow Waters I very happily made my E&s;cape. I had little Knowledge of the Country, but having formerly under&s;tood by our <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> at <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> that great Bodies of the &s;ame name, mortal Enemies unto the <HI>Tartars,</HI> dwelt upon the <HI>Nepper</HI> not far beyond <HI>Crim;</HI> by the help of the Sun and Stars, I journeyed due We&s;t many days without any di&s;a&s;trous Adventure, until I found them; who gave me a very kind reception: In this e&s;cape <HI>I</HI> traver&s;ed almo&s;t the whole De&s;art of <HI>Ingile</HI> and <HI>&V;ngule. Doro&s;ensko</HI> who then Commanded all the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> upon the the <HI>Nep|per,</HI> immediately made me a <HI>Poskofneke,</HI> from which time for the &s;pace of almo&s;t two years, I did accompany them in divers expeditions, in which we vi&s;ited mo&s;t of tho&s;e Countries which lye upon the Black Sea, to the no &s;mall vexation and lo&s;s of the In|habitants. We kept a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> upon the <HI>Don,</HI> and frequently a&s;i&s;ted each other. And being all Foot, and the Country exactly level, we travelled &s;urrounded with Wagons (which they call a Tabor) for fear of the <HI>Tartars</HI> who often &s;et upon us, but were as often repul&s;ed, we being well accommodated with Fire-Arms and &s;mall Field-piecs, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> do exceedingly fear and will not ordinarily attempt clo&s;ely, unle&s;s they have greatly the Odds in Number. But at length
<PB N="113" REF="330">
it was my ill Fortune between the <HI>Nepper</HI> and the <HI>Don</HI> to be again taken by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and by them carried into <HI>Crim,</HI> where I lived long in great mi&s;ery, and was at length &s;ould unto a <HI>Timariot Spahi</HI> living in <HI>Anadoule, (Anatolia</HI> or <HI>A&s;ia minor)</HI> with whom I lived 5 years, but in more ea&s;ie &s;ervitude than among the <HI>Tartars.</HI> And to make my &s;ervice le&s;s irk&s;ome, my Ma&s;ter be&s;towed on me a <HI>Wallachian</HI> Woman, whom I received for my Wife, though without the u&s;uall Solemnities of Marriage, which are practi&s;ed among Chri&s;tians: Under&s;tanding at length that a Lord Amba&s;&s;ador was re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in behalf of the King of <HI>Great Brittian,</HI> and to manage the Affairs of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in <HI>Turkey,</HI> I prevailed with my Ma&s;ter; who&s;e Favour I had gained to grant me my freedom, together with my Wives, if I &s;hould procure an hundred Dol|lars. Whereupon he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me in the company of a <HI>Turk</HI> his Friend, who upon my humble &s;upplicacion unto your Lord&s;hip receiving the formetioned Sum, did in the behalf of his Friend before the <HI>Cady</HI> make me free, and leave the Woman al&s;o at my Di&s;po&s;al. At the &s;ame time I very happily met with &s;ome <HI>Vallachian</HI> Gentlemen, who were &s;ent on a Me&s;&s;age from their <HI>Vayvod</HI> unto the <HI>Grand Seignor,</HI> They gladly received my Woman, and took her along with them, promi&s;ing upon their Return into their own Country, to Re&s;tore her unto her Parents.</P>
<P>Now that I may fully &s;atisfie your Lord&s;hip, that <HI>I</HI> had really vi&s;ited all tho&s;e Coun|tries which I have mentioned, <HI>I</HI> be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip let your Interpreter try me in tho&s;e Languages wherein he is skilled; and as for others wherewith he is not ac|quainted, I am ready to conver&s;e with any of tho&s;e Nations whom I pretend to know. For although I have never conver&s;ed much with Books, yet my great Travel ac|companied with a pretty good Memory, will &s;ufficiently Qualifie me to pa&s;s through the Countries I &s;hall hereafter mention.</P>
<P>To begin my Progre&s;s from <HI>Con&s;tantinople, I</HI> can pa&s;s over from <HI>Scutery,</HI> and thence by the help of my <HI>Tuki&s;h</HI> Language pa&s;s through all <HI>Anatolia;</HI> Thence leaving <HI>Armeniae</HI> on my right hand, and having the <HI>Black Sea</HI> on the left, go through <HI>Georgia, Mingrellia, Aba&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Sherca&s;&s;en</HI> Land with the &s;ame Tongue, and another, which with little va|riation is common unto them all. Thence into the <HI>Comukes</HI> Countrey, who are a &s;ort of <HI>Tarters</HI> and do agree with others of the &s;ame name in &s;peeeh, as indeed mo&s;t <HI>Tar|tars</HI> do; only they who are <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and conver&s;e much with the <HI>Turks,</HI> u&s;e divers <HI>Arabick</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> words whereunto the Heathen <HI>Tartars</HI> are &s;trangers: From <HI>Co|mukes</HI> Land I can pa&s;s into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but <HI>I</HI> am not &s;o well acquainted with their Country and Language, as <HI>I</HI> have el&s;ewhere acknowledged. Therefore to return unto <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> I can proceed from thence unto <HI>Romellia,</HI> or <HI>Romania,</HI> through <HI>Wallachy, Bealla Horda, Crim,</HI> the Great <HI>De&s;art I</HI> have &s;o often mentioned of <HI>Ingell</HI> and <HI>&V;ngull,</HI> the little <HI>Nagoy,</HI> &s;o over the <HI>Vogal</HI> unto <HI>A&s;tracan;</HI> thence through the Great <HI>Nagoy,</HI> and leaving the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> on my Right hand into the <HI>Caragans</HI> Country, and &s;o through <HI>Boghar</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia. I</HI> can al&s;o by my knowledge of the Languages peculiar unto the following Coun|tries traver&s;e all <HI>Ireland, England, Norway, Sweeden, Finland, Leifland, Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, Mordwa, Shereme&s;&s;a, Ca&s;&s;an, Kalmukes</HI> Land, <HI>Ca&s;&s;achy Horda, Yurgench,</HI> and leaving <HI>China</HI> on the left hand through <HI>Bochara</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Sir, nothing remains, But that I make mo&s;t humble and hearty acknow|ledgment of your great Genero&s;ity and Chri&s;tian Charity, in delivering a Stranger out of Captivity, wherein I had Otherwi&s;e continued without hope of &s;eeing my Friends or Country. And were I as expert at my Pen, as I have heretofore been at managing a Sword, <HI>I</HI> would by Con&s;igning my Travels to Writing, leave behind me a la&s;ting Monument of your Fame: But being for want of Learning and by long Di&s;u&s;e of my Mother Tongue rendered unfit for &s;uch a Work, I &s;hall where&s;oever <HI>I</HI> come proclaim your Worthine&s;s, and continually pray unto the Omnipotent GOD to return your Kindne&s;s into your Bo&s;ome a Thou&s;and fold. And &s;hall ever remain, during Life,</P>

<P>VIrtue &s;ometimes is no le&s;s intere&s;&s;ed than Affection: Both, Sir, are glad to receive from time to time pledges mutually an&s;wering for tho&s;e that have united them&s;elves in a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence. Yours indeed &s;hould demand of me &s;uch, as might be a &s;ecurity to you for the advance you have been plea&s;ed to make me of your Friend&s;hip. But &s;ince at pre&s;ent I have nothing worth pre&s;enting you with; and yet am unwilling to give you any lei&s;ure to be diffident of my realne&s;s, or to repent for having &s;o ea&s;ily given me a &s;hare in your e&s;teem, I here &s;end you a <HI>Relation</HI> of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> in which you will find &s;uch con&s;iderable Oc|currences, as will make you confe&s;s, I could not convey to you a more acceptable Pre&s;ent, and that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bernier,</HI> who hath written it, is a very Gallant Man, and of a mould, I wi&s;h all Travellers were made of. We ordinarily travel more out of <HI>&V;n&s;etledne&s;s</HI> than <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> with a de&s;ign to <HI>&s;ee</HI> Towns and Countries rather than to <HI>know</HI> their Inhabitants and Pro|ductions; and we &s;tay not long enough in a place, to inform our &s;elves well of the Government, Policy, Intere&s;ts and Manners of its People. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bernier,</HI> after he had benefitted him&s;elf for the &s;pace of many years by the conver&s;e of the famous <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi,</HI> &s;een him expire in his arms, &s;ucceeded him in his Knowledge, and inherited his Opinions and Di&s;cove|ries, embarqued for <HI>Aegypt,</HI> &s;tay'd above a whole year at <HI>Cairo,</HI> and then took the occa&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, that Trade in the Ports of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to pa&s;s to <HI>Suratte;</HI> and after Twelve years abode at the Court of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> is at la&s;t come to &s;eek his re&s;t in his native Countrey, there to give an Accompt of his Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;coveries, and to pour out into the bo&s;om of <HI>France,</HI> what he had ama&s;&s;ed in <HI>India.</HI></P>

greedine&s;s of the Curious, who prefer their &s;atisfaction to his quiet, and do already per&s;ecute him to have the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory. Neither &s;hall I mention to you the hazards he did run, by being in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Mecca;</HI> nor of his prudent Conduct, which made him merit the e&s;teem of his Generous <HI>Fazelcan,</HI> who &s;ince is become the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of that Great Empire, whom he taught the principal Languages of <HI>Europe,</HI> after he had Tran&s;lated for him the whole Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> and who&s;e leave he could not obtain to go home, till he had got for him a &s;e|lect number of our be&s;t <HI>European</HI> Books, thereby to &s;upply the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;uffer of his Per&s;on.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Late Revolution OF THE DOMINIONS OF THE GREAT MOGOL.</HEAD>
<P>_THE de&s;ire of &s;eeing the World having made me Travel into <HI>Pale|&s;tina</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> would not let me &s;top there; it put me upon a re&s;olution to &s;ee the <HI>Red Sea</HI> from one end to the other. I went from <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> after I had &s;taid there above a year; and in two and thirty hours, going the <HI>Caravan</HI>-pace, I arrived at <HI>Suez,</HI> where I Embarked in a Gally, which in &s;eventeen days carry'd me, always in &s;ight of Land, to the Port of <HI>Gidda,</HI> which is half a days Journey from <HI>Mecca.</HI> There I was con&s;trained (contrary to my hopes, and the promi&s;e which the <HI>Beig</HI> of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> had made me) to go a&s;hore on that pretended Holy Land of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> where a Chri&s;tian, that is not a Slave, dares not &s;et his foot. I &s;taid there four and thirty days; and then I Embarked in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which in fifteen days carried me along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia the Happy</HI> to <HI>Moka,</HI> near the Streight of <HI>Babel-mandel.</HI> I re&s;olved to pa&s;s thence to the I&s;le of <HI>Ma&s;owa</HI> and <HI>Arkiko,</HI> to get as far as <HI>Gouder,</HI> the Capital Town of the Countrey of <HI>Alebech,</HI> or the Kingdom of <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> but I received certain information, that, &s;ince the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had been killed there by the intrigue of the Queen-Mother, or expelled, together with the Je&s;uit Patriarch, whom they had brought thither from <HI>Goa,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks were not &s;afe there; a poor Capuchin having lo&s;t his head at <HI>Suaken,</HI> for having attempted to en|ter into that Kingdom: That indeed, by going under the name of a <HI>Greek,</HI> or an <HI>Ar|menian,</HI> I did not run &s;o great hazard, and that even the King him&s;elf, when he &s;hould know, that I could do him &s;ervice, would give me Land to Till by Slaves, which I might buy if I had money; but that undoubtedly they would forthwith oblige me to Marry, as they had lately done a certain Frier, who had pa&s;&s;ed there under the name of a <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;itian; and that they would never &s;uffer me to come away again.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, among others, induced me to change my re&s;olution. I went aboard of an <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Streights, and in two and twenty days I ar|rived at <HI>Suratte</HI> in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> the Empire of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> in the Year 1655. There I found, that he who then Reigned there, was call'd <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, King of the World; who, according to the Hi&s;tory of that Countrey, was Son of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> which &s;ignifieth Conqueror of the World, Grandchild of <HI>Ekbar,</HI> which is Great, and that thus a&s;cending by <HI>Houmayons,</HI> or the Fortunate, Father of <HI>Ekbar,</HI> and his other Predece&s;&s;ors, he was the <HI>Tenth</HI> of tho&s;e that were de&s;cended from that <HI>Timur-Lengue,</HI> which &s;ignifieth the <HI>Lame Prince,</HI> commonly and corruptly call'd <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> &s;o renowned for his Conque&s;ts; who married his near Kin&s;woman, the only Daughter of the Prince of
<PB N="2" REF="336">
the Nations of <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> call'd <HI>Mogols,</HI> who have left and communicated their Name to the Strangers, that now govern <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> the Countrey of the <HI>Indians,</HI> though tho&s;e that are employ'd in publick Charges and Offices, and even tho&s;e that are li&s;ted in the <HI>Militia,</HI> be not all of the Race of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> but Strangers, and Nations gather'd out of all Countries, mo&s;t of them <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Arabians,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Turks.</HI> For, to be e&s;teem'd a <HI>Mogol,</HI> 'tis enough to be a Stranger white of Face, and a <HI>Mahumetan;</HI> in di&s;tinction as well to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are brown, and <HI>Pagans,</HI> as to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> who are call'd <HI>Franguis.</HI></P>
<P>I found al&s;o at my arrival, <HI>that</HI> this King of the World, <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> of above &s;even|ty years of Age, had four Sons and two Daughters; <HI>that,</HI> &s;ome years &s;ince, he had made the&s;e four Sons Vice-Kings or Governors of four of his mo&s;t con&s;iderable Provinces or Kingdoms; <HI>that</HI> it was almo&s;t a year that he was fallen into a great &s;ickne&s;s, whence it was believed he would never recover: Which had occa&s;ioned a great divi&s;ion among the&s;e four Brothers (all laying claim to the Empire) and had kindled among them a War which la&s;ted about five years, and which I de&s;ign here to de&s;cribe, having been pre&s;ent at &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actions, and entertained for the &s;pace of eight years at that Court, where Fortune and the &s;mall &s;tock of Money (left me after divers Encounters with Robbers, and the Expences of a Voyage of &s;ix and forty days from <HI>Su|ratte</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> the Capital Towns of that Empire) obliged me to take a Sala|ry from the <HI>Grand Mogol</HI> in the quality of a Phy&s;itian, and a little after from <HI>Danech|mend-Kan,</HI> the mo&s;t knowing Man of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who had been <HI>Bakchis,</HI> or Great Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and was one of the mo&s;t powerful and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords of that Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elde&s;t</HI> of the&s;e four Sons of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was call'd <HI>Dara,</HI> that is <HI>Darius.</HI> The <HI>Second</HI> was call'd <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> that is, the Valiant Prince. The name of the <HI>Third</HI> was <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Ornament of the Throne. That of the <HI>Fourth</HI> was <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, De&s;ire accompli&s;hed. Of the two Daughters, the elde&s;t was call'd <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> that is, the Mi&s;tre&s;s Prince&s;s; and the younge&s;t <HI>Rau|chenara-Begum,</HI> which is as much as Bright Prince&s;s, or the Splendor of Prince&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey, to give &s;uch Names to their Princes and Prince&s;&s;es. Thus the Wife of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;o renown'd for her Beauty, and for having a Tomb, which much more de&s;erved to be reckon'd among the Wonders of the World, than tho&s;e un&s;hapen Ma&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e heaps of Stones in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was called <HI>Tage-Mehalle,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Crown of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and the Wife of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> who hath &s;o long govern'd the State, whil&s;t her Husband minded nothing but Drinking and Diverti&s;e|ments, was fir&s;t called <HI>Nour-Mehalle,</HI> and afterwards, <HI>Nour-Jehan-Begum,</HI> the Light of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> the Light of the <HI>World.</HI> The rea&s;on, why they give &s;uch kind of Names to the Great Ones, and not Names from their Land or Dominion (as is u&s;ual in <HI>Europe)</HI> is, becau&s;e all the Land being the Kings, there are no Marqui&s;ates, Earldoms and Dut|chies, of which the Grandees might bear their Names; all con&s;i&s;ts in Pen&s;ions either of Land or ready Money, which the King giveth, increa&s;eth, retrencheth, and takes away, as &s;eems good unto him: And 'tis even for this rea&s;on, that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> have al&s;o no other but &s;uch Names; one <HI>(for example)</HI> being called <HI>Raz-Audaze-Kan, i. e.</HI> a Thunderer; another, <HI>Safe Cheken-Kan,</HI> a Breaker of Ranks; a third, <HI>Bare-Audaze-Kan,</HI> a Man of Lightening; others, <HI>Dianet-Kan,</HI> or <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> or <HI>Fazel-Kan, i. e.</HI> the Faithful Lord, the Intelligent, the Perfect, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Dara,</HI> the Elde&s;t Son, wanted not good Qualities. He was Gallant in Conver&s;ation, Witty in Repartees, exceeding Civil and Liberal, but entertained too good an Opinion of his per&s;on, e&s;teeming him&s;elf alone capable of all, and thinking it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible that any Body was able to give him coun&s;el; in&s;omuch, that he would give reproachful Names to tho&s;e who pretended to advi&s;e him in any thing; whereby it came to pa&s;s, that even tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t affectionate to him, were &s;hie to di&s;cover to him the mo&s;t &s;ecret Intrigues of his Brothers. Be&s;ides, he was apt to be tran&s;ported with pa&s;|&s;ion, to menace, to injure, to affront, even the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords; but all pa&s;&s;ed over like a fla&s;h of light. Though he was a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and publickly expre&s;&s;ed in the ordinary Exerci&s;es of Religion to be &s;o, yet, in private, he was Heathen with the Hea|then, and Chri&s;tian with the Chri&s;tians. He had con&s;tantly about him of tho&s;e Hea|then Doctors, to whom he gave very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ions, and who (as was &s;aid) had in&s;tilled into him Opinions contrary to the Religion of the Land; of which I may touch &s;omething hereafter, when I &s;hall come to &s;peak of the Religion of the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="336">
or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> He al&s;o hearkened of late very willingly to the Reverend Father <HI>Buzee</HI> a Je&s;uit, and began very well to reli&s;h what he &s;ugge&s;ted. Yet there are &s;ome who &s;ay, that at the bottom he was void of all Religion, and that whatever he pretended in it, was only for curio&s;ity, or, as others &s;ay, out of policy, to make him&s;elf beloved by the Chri&s;tians, who are pretty numerous in his Artillery; but above all, to gain the Affecti|on of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> or Soveraign Gentiles, that were Tributary to the Empire, and to make them of his party upon occa&s;ion. Mean time, this hath not much furthered his Affairs, on the contrary, it will appear in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory, that the pretence u&s;ed by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> his third Brother, to cut off his head, was, that he was turned <HI>Kafer,</HI> that is to &s;ay, an Infidel, of no Religion, an Idolater.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> the &s;econd Brother, was much of the humor of <HI>Dara,</HI> but he was more clo&s;e and more &s;etled, and had better conduct and dexterity. He was fit to ma|nage an Intrigue well, and he made, under-hand, Friends, by the force of Pre&s;ents, which he heaped upon the great <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and principally upon the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Rajas,</HI> as <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> and &s;ome others; but he did &s;omewhat too much indulge his plea&s;ures, in entertaining an extraordinary number of Women, among whom when he was, he &s;pent whole days and nights in drinking, &s;inging, and dancing. He made them Pre|&s;ents of very rich Apparel; and he encrea&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened their Pen&s;ions according as the fancy took him: By which kind of life his Affairs did langui&s;h, and the Affections of ma|ny of his People cooled. He ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Religion of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> although <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> his Father, and all his Brothers, were of the <HI>Turki&s;h.</HI> 'Tis known that <HI>Mahumetani&s;m</HI> is divided into &s;everal Sects, which made that famous <HI>Check-Sady,</HI> Au|thor of the <HI>Gouli&s;tan,</HI> &s;ay in Ver&s;e, which is to this effect in Pro&s;e; <HI>I am a Dervich Drinker, I &s;eem to be without Religion, and I am known of &s;ixty two Sects.</HI> But of all tho&s;e Sects there are two principal ones, who&s;e Parti&s;ans are mortal Enemies to one ano|ther. The <HI>one</HI> is that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>O&s;mantous,</HI> that is, Sectators of <HI>O&s;man;</HI> they believing that 'tis he that was the true and lawful Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Maho|met,</HI> the Great Caliph or Soveraign Prie&s;t, to whom alone it did appertain to interpret the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and to decide the Controver&s;ies to be met with in the Law. The <HI>other</HI> is that of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> whom the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Chias, Rafezys, Aly-Merdans,</HI> that is, Secta|ries, Hereticks, Parti&s;ans of <HI>Aly,</HI> becau&s;e they believe, contrary to the belief of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that this Succe&s;&s;ion and Pontifical Authority, which I ju&s;t now intimated, was due only to <HI>Aly</HI> the Son-in-law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> It was by rea&s;on of State that <HI>Sultan Su|jah</HI> had embraced this latter Sect, con&s;idering that all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> being <HI>Chias,</HI> and mo&s;t of them, or their Children, having the greate&s;t power at the Court of <HI>Mogol,</HI> and hold|ing the mo&s;t important Places of the Empire, he had mo&s;t rea&s;on to hope, that, when occa&s;ion &s;erved, they would all take his part.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the third Brother, had not that Gallantry, nor &s;urprizing Pre&s;ence of <HI>Dara,</HI> he appeared more &s;erious and melancholy, and was indeed much more judicious, under&s;tanding the World very well, and knowing whom to chu&s;e for his &s;ervice and pur|po&s;e, and where to be&s;tow his favour and bounty mo&s;t for his intere&s;t. He was re&s;er|ved, crafty, and exceedingly ver&s;ed in di&s;&s;embling, in&s;omuch that for a long while he made profe&s;&s;ion to be <HI>Fakire,</HI> that is, Poor, <HI>Dervich,</HI> or Devout, renouncing the World, and feigning not to pretend at all to the Crown, but to de&s;ire to pa&s;s his life in Prayer, and other Devotions. In the mean time he failed not to make a Party at Court, e&s;pe|cially when he was made Vice-King of <HI>Decan;</HI> but he did it with &s;o much dexterity, art, and &s;ecre&s;ie, that it could hardly be perceived. He al&s;o had the skill to maintain him&s;elf in the affection of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Father, who although he much loved <HI>Dara,</HI> could yet not forbear to &s;hew that he e&s;teemed <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and judged him capable to Reign; which cau&s;ed jealou&s;ie enough in <HI>Dara,</HI> who began to find it, in&s;omuch that he could not hold from &s;aying &s;ometimes to his Friends in private, <HI>Of all my Brothers I apprehend only this Nemazi,</HI> that is, this <HI>Bigot,</HI> this great Praying-man.</P>
<P><HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> the younge&s;t of all, was the lea&s;t dextrous, and the lea&s;t judicious. He cared for nothing but mirth and pa&s;time, to drink, hunt, and &s;hoot. Yet he had &s;ome good qualities, for he was very civil and liberal; he gloried in it, that he kept no|thing &s;ecret; he de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Cabals;</HI> and he bragg'd openly, that he tru&s;ted only in his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m and Sword: In &s;hort, he was very Brave, and if this Bravery had been accompanied with &s;ome conduct, he would have carried the Bell from all his Brothers, and been King of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> as will appear in what is to follow.</P>
<P>Concerning the two Daughters, the Elde&s;t, <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> was very beautiful, and a
<PB N="4" REF="337">
great Wit, pa&s;&s;ionately beloved of her Father. It was even rumoured, that he loved her to that degree as is hardly to be imagined, and that he alledged for his excu&s;e, that, according to the determination of his <HI>Mullahs,</HI> or Doctors of his Law, it was permitted a Man to eat of the fruit of the Tree he had planted. He had &s;o great a confidence in her, that he had given her charge to watch over his &s;afety, and to have an eye to all what came to his Table: And &s;he knew perfectly to manage his humor, and even in the mo&s;t weighty Affairs to bend him as &s;he plea&s;ed. She was exceedingly enriched by great Pen&s;ions, and by co&s;tly Pre&s;ents, which &s;he received from all Parts, for &s;uch Nego|tiations as &s;he employed her &s;elf in about her Father: And &s;he made al&s;o great Expences, being of a very liberal and generous di&s;po&s;ition. She &s;tuck entirely to <HI>Dara,</HI> her elde&s;t Brother, e&s;pou&s;ed cordially his part, and declared openly for him; which contributed not a little to make the Affairs of <HI>Dara</HI> pro&s;per, and to keep him in the affection of his Father; for &s;he &s;upported him in all things, and adverti&s;ed him of all occurrences: Yet that was not &s;o much, becau&s;e he was the elde&s;t Son, and &s;he the elde&s;t Daughter (as the People believed) as becau&s;e he had promi&s;ed her, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould come to the Crown, he would marry her; which is altogether extraordinary, and almo&s;t never practi&s;ed in <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;cruple to relate here &s;ome of the <HI>Amours</HI> of this Prince&s;s, although &s;hut up in a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and well kept, like other Women. Neither &s;hall I apprehend, that I may be thought to prepare matter for a Romancer; for they are not <HI>Amours</HI> like ours, followed by Gallant and <HI>Comical</HI> Adventures, but attended with Events dreadful and <HI>Tragical.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis reported, that this Prince&s;s found means to let a young Gallant enter the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> who was of no great Quality, but proper, and of a good Meen. But among &s;uch a number of jealous and envious per&s;ons, &s;he could not carry on her bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o pri|vily, but &s;he was di&s;cover'd. <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> her Father, was &s;oon adverti&s;ed of it, and re&s;olved to &s;urprize her, under the pretence of giving her a Vi&s;it, as he u&s;ed to do. The Prince&s;s &s;eeing him come unexpected, had no more time than to hide this unfortunate Lover in one of the great Chaudrons made to Bath in; which yet could not be &s;o done, but that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;u&s;pected it. Mean time he quarrelled not with his Daughter, but entertained her a pretty while, as he was wont to do; and at length told her, that he found her in a carele&s;s and le&s;s neat po&s;ture; that it was convenient &s;he &s;hould wa&s;h her &s;elf, and bath oftner; commanding pre&s;ently, with &s;omewhat a &s;tern countenance, that forthwith a Fire &s;hould be made under that Chaudron, and he would not part thence, before the Eunuchs had brought him word, that that unhappy Man was di&s;patched. Some time after &s;he took other mea&s;ures, &s;he cho&s;e for her <HI>Kane-&s;aman,</HI> that is, her Steward, a certain <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> called <HI>Nazerkan,</HI> who was a young <HI>Omrah,</HI> the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the whole Court; a Man of Courage and Ambition, the Dar|ling of all, in&s;omuch that <HI>Chah-He&s;tkan,</HI> Uncle of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> propo&s;ed to marry him to the Prince&s;s: But <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> received that Propo&s;ition very ill, and be&s;ides, when he was informed of &s;ome of the &s;ecret Intrigues that had been formed, he re&s;olved quick|ly to rid him&s;elf of <HI>Nazerkan.</HI> He therefore pre&s;ented to him, as 'twere to do him honour, a <HI>Betele,</HI> which he could not refu&s;e to chew pre&s;ently, after the cu&s;tom of the Countrey. <HI>Betele</HI> is a little knot made up of very delicate leaves, and &s;ome other things, with a little chalk of Sea-Cockles, which maketh the mouth and lips of a ver|milion colour, and the breath &s;weet and plea&s;ing. This young Lord thought of nothing le&s;s than being poy&s;oned: He went away from the Company very jocund and content, into his <HI>Paleky;</HI> but the Drug was &s;o &s;trong, that before he could come to his hou&s;e, he was no more alive.</P>
<P><HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> never pa&s;&s;ed for &s;o hand&s;om and &s;piritual as <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> but &s;he was not le&s;s cheerful, and comely enough, and hated plea&s;ures no more than her Si&s;ter. But &s;he addicted her &s;elf wholly to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and con&s;equently declared her &s;elf an Enemy to <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> and <HI>Dara.</HI> This was the cau&s;e, that &s;he had no great Riches, nor any con&s;iderable &s;hare in the Affairs of the State: Neverthele&s;s as &s;he was in the <HI>Se|raglio,</HI> and wanted no Wit and Spies, &s;he could not but di&s;cover many important mat|ters, of which &s;he gave &s;ecret adverti&s;ement to <HI>Aureng Zebe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;ome years before the Troubles, finding him&s;elf charged with the&s;e four Princes, all come to Age, all Married, all pretending to the Crown, Enemies to one another, and each of them making &s;ecretly a Party, was perplexed enough, as to what was fitte&s;t for him to do, fearing danger to his own per&s;on, and fore&s;eeing what after|wards
<PB N="5" REF="337">
befell him: For, to &s;hut them up in <HI>Goualeor,</HI> which is a Fortre&s;s where the Princes are ordinarily kept clo&s;e, and which is held impregnable, it being &s;ituated upon an inacce&s;&s;ible Rock, and having within it &s;elf good water, and provi&s;ion enough for a Gari&s;on; <HI>that</HI> was not &s;o ea&s;ie a thing. They were too potent already, each of them having a Princely Train. And again, he could not hand&s;omly remove them far off, with|out giving them &s;ome Government fit for their Birth; wherein he apprehended they would Cantonize them&s;elves, and become little independent Kings, as actually they afterwards did. Neverthele&s;s, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould cut one anothers Throat before his Eyes, if he kept them &s;till at Court, he at la&s;t concluded to &s;end them away. And &s;o he &s;ent <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> his &s;econd Son, into the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale;</HI> his third, <HI>Au|reng-Zebe,</HI> into <HI>Decan;</HI> and the younge&s;t, <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> to <HI>Guzaratte;</HI> giving to <HI>Dara,</HI> the elde&s;t, <HI>Cabal</HI> and <HI>Multan.</HI> The three fir&s;t went away very well content with their Government, and there they acted each the Soveraign, and retained all the Revenues of their re&s;pective Countries, entertaining great Troops, under the pretence of bridling their Subjects and Neighbours. As to <HI>Dara,</HI> becau&s;e the elde&s;t, and de&s;igned to the Crown, he &s;tirred not from the Court; which that he &s;hould not do, &s;eemed al&s;o to be the intention of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who entertained him in the hopes of &s;ucceeding him after his death. He even permitted then, that Orders were i&s;&s;ued out by him, and that he might &s;it in a kind of Throne, beneath his, among the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> &s;o that it &s;eemed, as if there were two Kings together. But as 'tis very difficult for two Soveraigns to agree, <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> though <HI>Dara</HI> &s;hew'd him great ob&s;ervance and affection, always harbour'd &s;ome di&s;&s;idence, fearing above all things the <HI>Mor&s;el;</HI> and be&s;ides, for as much as he knew the parts of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and thought him more capable to Reign than any of the re&s;t, he had always (as they &s;ay) &s;ome particular corre&s;pondence with him.</P>
<P>This it is, what I thought fit to premi&s;e concerning the&s;e four Princes, and their Fa|ther <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for the under&s;tanding of all that follows. I e&s;teem'd al&s;o, that I was not to forget tho&s;e two Prince&s;&s;es, as having been the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actors in the Tragedy; the Women in the <HI>Indies</HI> taking very often, as well as at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in many other places, the be&s;t part in the mo&s;t important Tran|&s;actions, though men take &s;eldom notice of it, and trouble their heads of &s;eeking for other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But to deliver this Hi&s;tory with clearne&s;s, we mu&s;t ri&s;e &s;omewhat higher, and relate what pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ome time before the Troubles, between <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and his Vi&s;ier <HI>Emir-Jemla;</HI> becau&s;e this will di&s;cover to us the character and temper of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who is to be the <HI>Heros</HI> of this Piece, and the King of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Let us then &s;ee, after what manner <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> proceeded, to lay the fir&s;t foundation of the Royalty of <HI>Aureng Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>During the time that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was in <HI>Decan,</HI> the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> had for his Vi&s;ier and General of his Armies this <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> who was a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> by Nation, and very famous in the <HI>Indies.</HI> He was not a man of great Extraction, but beaten in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, a per&s;on of excellent parts, and a great Captain. He had the wit of ama&s;&s;ing great Trea&s;ures, not only by the admini&s;tration of the affairs of this opulent Kingdom, but al&s;o by Navigation and Trade, &s;ending Ships into very many Parts, and cau&s;ing the Diamond Mines, which he alone had farmed under many borrowed names, to be wrought with extraordinary diligence. So that people di&s;cour&s;ed almo&s;t of nothing but of the Riches of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and of the plenty of his Diamonds, which were not reckon'd but by Sacks. He had al&s;o the skill to render him&s;elf very potent and con&s;iderable, en|tertaining, be&s;ides the Armies of the King, very good Troops for his particular, and above all a very good Artillery, with abundance of <HI>Franguys</HI> or Chri&s;tians to manage it. In a word, he grew &s;o rich, and &s;o pui&s;&s;ant, e&s;pecially after he had found a way to enter into the Kingdom of <HI>Karnates,</HI> and to pillage all the ancient Churches of the Idols of that Countrey, that the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> became jealous of it, and prepared him&s;elf to un&s;addle him; and that the more, becau&s;e he could not bear what was reported of him, as if he had u&s;ed too great familiarity with the Queen his Mother, that was yet beauteous. Yet he di&s;cover'd nothing of his de&s;ign to any, having patience, and wait|ing till <HI>Emir</HI> came to the Court, for he was then in the Kingdom of <HI>Karnates</HI> with his Army. But one day, when more particular News was brought him of what had pa&s;&s;ed between his mother and him, he had not power enough to di&s;&s;emble any longer, but was tran&s;ported by choler to fall to invectives and menaces: Whereof <HI>Emir</HI> was &s;oon made acquainted, having at the Court abundance of his Wives Kindred, and all his
<PB N="6" REF="338">
neare&s;t Relations and be&s;t Friends po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the principal Offices. The King's Mother al&s;o, who did not hate him, had &s;peedy information of the &s;ame. Which obliged <HI>Emir,</HI> without delay, to write to his only Son, <HI>Mahmet Emir-Kan,</HI> who then was about the King, requiring him to do the be&s;t he could to withdraw with all &s;peed from the Court, under &s;ome pretence of Hunting, or the like, and to come and join with him. <HI>Mahmet Emir-Kan</HI> failed not to attempt divers ways; but, the King cau&s;ing him to be narrowly ob&s;erved, none of them all would &s;ucceed. This very much perplexed <HI>Emir,</HI> and made him take a &s;trange re&s;olution, which ca&s;t the King in great danger to lo&s;e his Crown and Life; &s;o true 'tis, that <HI>he who knows not to Di&s;&s;emble, knows not how to Reign.</HI> He writ to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who was then in <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Decan,</HI> about fifteen or &s;ixteen days Journey from <HI>Golkonda,</HI> giving him to under&s;tand, <HI>that</HI> the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> did intend to ruine him and his Family, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ignal Services he had done him, as all the World knew; which was an unexampled Inju&s;tice and In|gratitude; <HI>that</HI> this nece&s;&s;iated him to take his refuge to him, and to intreat him, that he would receive him into his protection; <HI>that,</HI> for the re&s;t, if he would follow his ad|vice, and confide in him, he would &s;o di&s;po&s;e Affairs, that he would at once put into his hands both the King and Kingdom of <HI>Golkonda.</HI> This thing he made very ea&s;ie, u&s;ing the following Di&s;cour&s;e: You need but take four or five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, of the be&s;t of your Army, and to march with Expedition to <HI>Golkonda,</HI> &s;preading a rumor by the way, that 'tis an Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> that goes in ha&s;te, about con&s;iderable mat|ters, to &s;peak with the King at <HI>Bag-naguer.</HI> The <HI>Dabir,</HI> who is he that is fir&s;t to be addre&s;&s;ed unto, to make any thing known unto the King, is allied to me, and my crea|ture, and altogether mine; take care of nothing but to march with Expedition, and I will &s;o order it, that without making you known, you &s;hall come to the Gates of <HI>Bag-naguer;</HI> and when the King &s;hall come out to receive the Letters, according to cu&s;tom, you may ea&s;ily &s;eize on him, and afterwards of all his Family, and do with him what &s;hall &s;eem good to you; in regard that his hou&s;e of <HI>Bag-naguer,</HI> where he commonly re&s;ides, is unwalled and unfortified. He added, <HI>that</HI> he would make this Enterpri&s;e up|on his own charges, offering him fifty thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> a day (which is about five and twenty thou&s;and Crowns) during the whole time of the March.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who looked only for &s;ome &s;uch occa&s;ion, had no mind at all to lo&s;e &s;o fair an one. He &s;oon undertook the Expedition, and did &s;o fortunately manage his En|terpri&s;e, that he arrived at <HI>Bag-naguer,</HI> without being otherwi&s;e known than as an Am|ba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> The King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> being adverti&s;ed of the arrival of this pretended Amba&s;&s;ador, came forth into a Garden, according to cu&s;tom, received him with honour, and having unfortunately put him&s;elf into the hands of his Enemy, ten or twelve Slaves, <HI>Gurgis,</HI> were ready to fall upon and to &s;eize his per&s;on, as had been pro|jected; but that a certain <HI>Omrah,</HI> touched with tenderne&s;s, could not forbear to cry out, though he was of the Party, and a creature of <HI>Emir, Doth not your Maje&s;ty &s;ee that this is</HI> Aureng-Zebe? <HI>Away, or you are taken.</HI> Whereat the King being a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">righted, &s;lips away, and gets ha&s;tily on hor&s;eback, riding with all his might to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Golkon|da,</HI> which is but a &s;hort League from thence.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;eeing he was defeated in his de&s;ign, yet was not therefore di&s;compo&s;ed; but &s;eized at the &s;ame time on the Royal Hou&s;e, taketh all the rich and good things he finds there; yet &s;ending to the King all his Wives (which over all the <HI>Indies</HI> is very re|ligiou&s;ly ob&s;erved) and goeth to be&s;iege him in his Fortre&s;s. But as the Siege, for want of having brought along all Nece&s;&s;aries, held on long, and la&s;ted above two months, he received order from <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to rai&s;e it, and to retire into <HI>Decan</HI> again; &s;o that, although the Fortre&s;s was reduced to Extremities, for want of Victuals and Ammunition of War, he found him&s;elf obliged to abandon his Enterpri&s;e. He knew very well, that it was <HI>Dara</HI> and <HI>Begum</HI> that had induced <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to &s;end the&s;e Or|ders, from the apprehen&s;ion they entertained, that he would become too powerful; but in the mean time he never di&s;cover'd any re&s;entment of it, &s;aying only, that he ought to obey the Orders of his Father. Yet he withdrew not, without cau&s;ing under-hand payment to be made to him of all the Charges of his Expedition: Be&s;ides, he married his Son <HI>Sultan Mahmond</HI> to the elde&s;t Daughter of that King, with a promi&s;e, that he would make him his Succe&s;&s;or, cau&s;ing him al&s;o to give him for a Dowry the Fortre&s;s and the Appurtenances of <HI>Bamguyre.</HI> He al&s;o made the King con&s;ent, that all the Silver Money that &s;hould be Coined for the future in that Kingdom, &s;hould bear on one &s;ide the Arms of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> and that <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> &s;hould withdraw with his whole Fami|ly, all his Goods, Troops, and Artillery.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="338">
The&s;e two great Men were not long together, but they framed great de&s;igns: On the way they be&s;ieged and took <HI>Bider,</HI> one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t important Places of <HI>Vi&s;apour;</HI> and thence they went to <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> where they contracted &s;o intimate a friend&s;hip together, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could not live without &s;eeing <HI>Emir</HI> twice a day, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Emir</HI> without &s;eeing <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Their Union began to cau&s;e a new Face in all the Affairs of tho&s;e Parts, and laid the fir&s;t foundations of the Royalty of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince having u&s;ed the Art to make him&s;elf to be called to the Court divers times, went with great and rich Pre&s;ents to <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> pre&s;enting him his &s;ervice, and inducing him to make War again&s;t the King of <HI>Golkunda,</HI> and him of <HI>Vi|&s;apour,</HI> and again&s;t the <HI>Portugals.</HI> At fir&s;t he pre&s;ented to him that great Diamond, which is e&s;teem'd matchle&s;s; giving him to under&s;tand, that the precious &s;tones of <HI>Gol|konda</HI> were quite other things, than tho&s;e Rocks of <HI>Kandabar;</HI> that <HI>there</HI> it was, where the War ought to be made, to get the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, and to go as far as <HI>Cape-Como|ry. Chah-Jehan,</HI> whether it were that he was dazled by the Diamonds of <HI>Emir,</HI> or whether he thought it fit, as &s;ome believe he did, to have an Army in the Field, &s;ome|what to re&s;train <HI>Dara,</HI> whom he found active in making him&s;elf potent, and who with in&s;olence had ill treated the Vi&s;ier <HI>Sadullah-Kan</HI> (whom <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately loved, and con&s;idered as the greate&s;t State&s;man that had been in the <HI>Indies)</HI> cau&s;ing him even to be made away with Poi&s;on, as a Man not of his Party, but inclined to <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> or rather, becau&s;e he found him too powerful, and in a condition to be the Umpire of the Crown, if <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;hould decea&s;e; or la&s;tly, becau&s;e being neither <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> nor of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Extraction, but an <HI>Indian,</HI> there were not wanting envious per&s;ons, who &s;pread abroad, that he entertained in divers places numerous Troops of <HI>Patans,</HI> very gallant men, and well paid, with a de&s;ign to make him&s;elf King, or his Son; or at lea&s;t to ex|pel the <HI>Mogels,</HI> and to re&s;tore to the Throne the Nation of the <HI>Patans,</HI> of whom he had taken his Wife. However it be, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end an Army towards <HI>Decan,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Emir-Jemla.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dara,</HI> who &s;aw the con&s;equence of this Affair, and that the &s;ending of Troops for tho&s;e Parts, was to give &s;trength to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> oppo&s;ed it exceedingly, and did what he could to hinder it. Neverthele&s;s, when he &s;aw that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was re&s;olute for it, he at la&s;t thought it be&s;t to con&s;ent; but with this condition, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould keep in <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> as Governor only of the Countrey, without medling at all in the War, or pretending to govern the Army; that <HI>Emir</HI> &s;hould be the ab&s;olute General, who for a pledge of his Fidelity was to leave his whole Family at the Court. <HI>Emir</HI> &s;trugled enough within him&s;elf, whether he &s;hould agree to this la&s;t condition, but when <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> de&s;ir'd him to give that &s;atisfaction to <HI>Dara,</HI> and promi&s;ed him, that after a little while he would &s;end him back his Wife and Children, he con&s;ented, and marched into <HI>Decan</HI> towards <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> with a very gallant Army, and without any &s;top entred into <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> where he be&s;ieged a &s;trong place called <HI>Kaliane.</HI></P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> were in that condition, as I have been relating, when <HI>Chah-Jahan</HI> fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, I &s;hall not &s;peak here of his &s;ickne&s;s, much le&s;s relate the particulars of it. I &s;hall only &s;ay this, that it was little &s;uitable to a man of above Seventy years of Age, who &s;hould rather think on pre&s;erving his &s;trength, than to ruine it, as he did. This &s;ickne&s;s did &s;oon alarm and trouble all <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> Mighty Armies were levied in <HI>Dehly</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> the Capitals of the Empire. <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> did the like in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in <HI>Decan,</HI> and <HI>Mord-Bakche</HI> in <HI>Guzaratte:</HI> All four a&s;&s;em|bled to them&s;elves their Allies and Friends; all four write, promi&s;e, and form divers Intrigues. <HI>Dara</HI> having &s;urpri&s;ed &s;ome of their Letters, &s;hew'd them to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and made great noi&s;e about them; and his Si&s;ter <HI>Begum</HI> failed not to make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion, to animate the King again&s;t them. But <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was diffident of <HI>Dara,</HI> and fearing to be poi&s;oned, gave order, that particular care &s;hould be had of what was brought to his Table. 'Twas al&s;o &s;aid, that he wrote to <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> and that <HI>Dara</HI> being adverti&s;ed thereof, could not forbear to menace, and to break into very pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions. In the mean time the di&s;temper of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> lingred, and 'twas bruited every where, that he was dead. Whereupon the whole Court was di&s;order'd, the whole Town alarm'd, the Shops for many days &s;hut up; and the four Sons of the King made openly great Preparations, each for him&s;elf: And to &s;ay truth, it was not without rea|&s;on, that they all made ready for War; for they all very well knew, that there was no hopes of Quarter, that there was no other way, than to vanqui&s;h or die, to be King or

undone, and that he that &s;hould be Conqueror would rid him&s;elf of all the re&s;t, as for|merly <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had done of his Brothers.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who had heaped up great Trea&s;ures in that rich Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> ruining &s;ome of the <HI>Rajas</HI> or petty Kings that are in tho&s;e Parts, and drawing great Sums from others, took the Field fir&s;t of all with a pui&s;&s;ant Army, and in the confidence he had of all the <HI>Per&s;ian Omrahs,</HI> for the Sect of whom he had declared him&s;elf, he boldly marched towards <HI>Agra,</HI> giving out openly, that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was dead, that <HI>Dara</HI> had poi&s;on'd him, that he would revenge the death of his Father, and, in a word, that he would be King. <HI>Dara</HI> de&s;ired <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to write him&s;elf to him, and to forbid him to advance further; which he did, a&s;&s;uring him, that his &s;ickne&s;s was not at all dangerous, and that he was already much better. But he having Friends at Court, who a&s;&s;ured him that the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was mortal, he di&s;&s;embled, and cea&s;ed not to advance, &s;aying &s;till, that he knew very well <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was dead; and if he &s;hould be alive, he was de&s;irous to come and ki&s;s his feet, and to receive his Com|mands.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> immediately after, if not at the &s;ame time, taketh the Field al&s;o in <HI>De|can,</HI> maketh a great noi&s;e, and prepareth to march towards <HI>Agra.</HI> The &s;ame prohi|bition was made to him al&s;o, as well from <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> as from <HI>Dara,</HI> who threaten'd him. But he di&s;&s;embleth, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had done, and giveth the like an&s;wer. Mean time, finding that his Trea&s;ure was low, and his Soldiery very incon&s;iderable, he devi&s;ed two Artifices, which &s;ucceeded admirably well; the one, in regard of <HI>Morad-Bakche;</HI> the other, in re&s;pect of <HI>Emir-Jemla.</HI> To <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> he writes with &s;peed a very fair Letter, importing, <HI>that</HI> he had always been his true and intimate Friend; <HI>that,</HI> as for him&s;elf, he laid no claim at all to the Crown; <HI>that</HI> he might remember, he had all his life-time made profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Fakire,</HI> but that <HI>Dara</HI> was a per&s;on incapable to govern a Kingdom; <HI>that</HI> he was a <HI>Kafer,</HI> an Idolater, and hated of all the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs;</HI> that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was a <HI>Rafezy,</HI> an Heretick, and by con&s;e|quence an Enemy to <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and unworthy of the Crown: So that, in a word, there was none but he <HI>(Morad-Bakche)</HI> that could rea&s;onably pretend to the Succe&s;&s;ion; <HI>that</HI> the Crown did expect him; <HI>that</HI> the whole Court, which was not ignorant of his Valor, would be for him; and <HI>that</HI> for his particular, if he would promi&s;e him, that being King, he would give him leave to live quietly in &s;ome corner or other of his Empire, there to &s;erve God the remainder of his days, he was ready to make a conjunction with him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his Coun&s;el and Friends, and to put into his hands his whole Army, to fight <HI>Dara</HI> and <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> that in the mean time he &s;ent him an Hundred thou&s;and <HI>Rupies</HI> (which make about Fifty thou&s;and Crowns of our money) and prayed him to accept thereof as a pledge of his friend&s;hip; and <HI>that</HI> he would advi&s;e him to come with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to &s;eize on the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Suratte,</HI> where he knew to be the Trea|&s;ure of the Land.</P>
<P><HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> who was neither too rich, nor too powerful, received with much joy this Propo&s;ition of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and the Hundred thou&s;and <HI>Rupies</HI> &s;ent by him; and &s;hew'd <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Letter to every body, thereby to oblige the Flower of that Coun|trey to take up Arms for him, and the &s;ub&s;tantial Merchants to lend him the more wil|lingly &s;uch Sums of money as he demanded of them. He began in good earne&s;t to act the King, made large promi&s;es to all, and, in &s;hort, did &s;o well, that he &s;et a good Ar|my on foot, of whom he fingled out &s;ome Three thou&s;and, who, under the conduct of <HI>Chah-Abas,</HI> one of his Eunuchs, but a valiant man, &s;hould go to be&s;iege <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;ent his elde&s;t Son, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> (him whom he had married to the Daughter of the King of <HI>Golkonda)</HI> to <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> who was yet employed in the &s;iege of <HI>Kaliane,</HI> to per&s;wade him to come to him to <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> pretending to have mat|ter of the greate&s;t importance to communicate to him. <HI>Emir,</HI> who &s;oon &s;u&s;pected his intentions, excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying openly, that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was not dead, <HI>that</HI> he had fre&s;h News of his being alive, and <HI>that</HI> be&s;ides, all his Family being at <HI>Agra</HI> in the hands of <HI>Dara,</HI> he could by no means a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> nor declare him&s;elf for him. Where|upon <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> return'd to <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> without effecting any thing, and very much di&s;&s;atisfied with <HI>Emir.</HI> But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> lo&s;t no courage for all that, but &s;ent the &s;econd time to <HI>Emir,</HI> yet not <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> but <HI>Sultan Mazum</HI> his &s;econd Son, who pre&s;ented to him his Fathers Letter, and handled him with that dexterity, &s;weetne&s;s, and prote&s;tation of friend&s;hip, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t him. <HI>Emir</HI> therefore pre&s;&s;ed the &s;iege of <HI>Kaliane,</HI> forced the be&s;ieged to &s;urrender upon compo&s;ition, took the

choice of his Army, and with all diligence went away with <HI>Sultan Mazum.</HI> At his ar|rival, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> courted him in the highe&s;t degree, treating him no otherwi&s;e than with the name of <HI>Baba</HI> and <HI>Babagy,</HI> that is, Father, Lord-Father; and after an hun|dred Embraces, he took him &s;omewhat a&s;ide, and told him (according to what I could learn from per&s;ons who knew of it) <HI>That it was not ju&s;t, that having his Family at the Court, he &s;hould adventure to do any thing in his behalf that might come to be known; but that, after all, there was nothing &s;o difficult but an Expedient might be found.

It is out of doubt, that all the World will believe it done in earne&s;t: For who would imagine, that &s;uch a per&s;on as you would be content to let your &s;elf be laid in Pri|&s;on? In the interim, I could make u&s;e of part of your Army, and of your Artillery, as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t proper and convenient: You al&s;o could furni&s;h me with a Sum of mo|ney, as you have frequently offered it; and be&s;ides, methinks I might tempt Fortune further, and we might together take our mea&s;ures, to &s;ee in what manner I had be&s;t to domean my &s;elf, if you would al&s;o permit, that I might cau&s;e you to be tran&s;ported into the Fortre&s;s of</HI> Dau|let-Abad, <HI>where you &s;hould be Ma&s;ter; and that there I might have you kept by my own Son,</HI> Sultan Mazum, <HI>or</HI> Sultan Mahmoud; <HI>this would yet better palliate the matter, and I &s;ee not, what</HI> Dara <HI>could ju&s;tly &s;ay of it, nor how he could rea&s;onably treat your Wife and Children ill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Emir,</HI> whether it were by rea&s;on of the friend&s;hip he had &s;worn to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> or for the great promi&s;es made to him, or the apprehen&s;ion he had, of &s;eeing near him <HI>Sul|tan Mazum,</HI> who &s;tood by, very pen&s;ive and well armed, and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who looked grim upon him for his coming away at the &s;olicitation of his Brother, not at that of his, and had at his very entrance lift up his foot, as if he would have hit him; what|ever of the&s;e Con&s;iderations might induce him, con&s;ented to all what <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> de&s;i|red, and approved of the Expedient to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be impri&s;on'd; &s;o that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> being no &s;ooner gone, but the great Ma&s;ter of the Artillery was &s;een to approach with &s;ome fiercene&s;s to <HI>Emir,</HI> and to command him in the name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> to fol|low him, locking him up in a Chamber, and there giving him very good words, whil&s;t all the Soldiery that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had thereabout, went to their Arms.

But the whole matter being altogether counterfeited, all the&s;e Commotions were pre&s;ently calmed, <HI>by</HI> the intimations that were given to the chief Of|ficers of <HI>Emir</HI>'s Army, and <HI>by</HI> the pre&s;ence of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who there appeared very re&s;olute with his two Sons, and &s;poke now to one, then to another; and at la&s;t <HI>by</HI> Pro|mi&s;es and Pre&s;ents, liberally be&s;towed on tho&s;e that were concerned. So that all the Troops of <HI>Emir,</HI> and even mo&s;t of tho&s;e of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;eeing things troubled, and being without their General, and believing <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to be dead, or, at be&s;t, de&s;pe|rately &s;ick; con&s;idering al&s;o the ample promi&s;es made to them of augmenting their Sti|pend, and of giving them at that very time three months Advance, &s;oon La&s;ted them|&s;elves under <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> who having &s;eized on all the Equipage of <HI>Emir,</HI> even his very Camels and Tents, took the Field, re&s;olved to march to the Siege of <HI>Suratte,</HI> and to ha&s;ten the taking it in; where <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e that his be&s;t Troops were employed there, and that he found more re&s;i&s;tance in that place than he imagined. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> after &s;ome days March, was informed, that the Go|vernor had &s;urrendred the Place; for which he &s;ent Congratulations to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> acquainting him withal of his Tran&s;actions with <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and a&s;&s;uring him, <HI>that</HI> he had Forces and Money enough, and very good intelligence at the Court; <HI>that</HI> nothing was wanting; <HI>that</HI> he was directly going to <HI>Brampour</HI> and <HI>Agra; that</HI> he had expected him on the way, and therefore de&s;ired him to join with him.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> found not &s;o much money in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Suratte</HI> as he had imagined, whether it were that really there was not &s;o much as was reported, or whether the Governor had diverted a part of it, as &s;ome believed: Yet notwith|&s;tanding that little he found there was u&s;eful to him, to pay the Soldiers that had Li&s;ted

them&s;elves in hopes of the advantages, they &s;hould make of the imagined va&s;t Trea&s;ure of <HI>Suratte.</HI> 'Tis not le&s;s true, that he had no greater rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the taking of this Place, in regard there was not any Regular Fortification about it; and yet his Army had lain before it above a month, and would never have reduced it without the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who furni&s;hed them with the Invention of Springing a Mine, which ruin|ing a great &s;ide of the Wall, ca&s;t the be&s;ieged into &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that it made them immediately &s;urrender. The reduction of this Town did much advance his De|&s;ign, Fame proclaiming immediately throughout the&s;e Countreys, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> had taken <HI>Suratte;</HI> that he had &s;prung a Mine, which &s;ounded very big among the <HI>Indians,</HI> who as yet do little under&s;tand that practice; and that there he had found a va&s;t Trea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding this great noi&s;e, and all the fir&s;t advantages, joyned to all tho&s;e frequent Letters and great Promi&s;es of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the Eunuch, <HI>Chah-Abas,</HI> a Man of good Sen&s;e, of a great Heart, and exceedingly affectionate to the Ser|vice of his Ma&s;ter, was not of opinion, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> &s;hould &s;o much tye him|&s;elf in Intere&s;t to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> or precipitate his conjunction with him, but advi&s;ed, that he &s;hould amu&s;e him with words, and let him advance alone towards <HI>Agra;</HI> that in the mean time there would come certain News of the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> that he &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee what Channel Affairs would run in; that he &s;hould Fortifie <HI>Suratte,</HI> as a very good Po&s;t, able to render him Ma&s;ter of a very large and rich Countrey; and that perhaps in time he might &s;eize <HI>Brampour,</HI> which is a very con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;age of a River, and as 'twere a Bar of <HI>Decan.</HI> But the continual Letters and Prote&s;tations of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> joyned to the &s;mall Forces, Artillery, and Trea&s;ure of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> blinded with an exce&s;&s;ive ambition to Reign, made him regardle&s;s of all other con&s;i|derations; &s;o that he went away from <HI>Amadevad,</HI> abandoned <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> and took his way through the Woods and Mountains, with all Expedition, to be at the Rendez|vouz, where <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had looked for him the&s;e two or three days.</P>
<P>Great Solemnities of Joy were made at the conjunction of the two Armies, the Prin|ces vi&s;ited one another, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made a hundred Prote&s;tations and no le&s;s Promi|&s;es to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> a&s;&s;ured him afre&s;h, and &s;olemnly, of his not caring for the Crown, as al&s;o of his being there for no other end than to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t <HI>Dara,</HI> their Common Enemy, and to place him in the Throne, which expected him.</P>
<P>Upon this Enterview, and confirmation of Friend&s;hip, both Armies marched toge|ther, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> continuing always, during the March, in the Prote&s;tations of Friend|&s;hip, and in his Court&s;hip to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> treating him never otherwi&s;e, whether in publick or private, but with the Title of <HI>Hazaret,</HI> that is, King and Maje&s;ty: So that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was fully per&s;waded, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> meant &s;incerely, from an exce&s;s of affection towards him; whence he even willingly, and without Ceremony, &s;uffered the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and re&s;pects he &s;hewed him; in&s;tead of remembring what had lately pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and of con&s;idering, that he, who had thus hazarded him&s;elf with &s;o much boldne&s;s to u&s;urp a Kingdom, was not of a temper to live and dye a <HI>Fakire.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two Armies thus joyned made a Body con&s;iderable enough; which begot a great noi&s;e at Court, and gave cau&s;e of thoughtfulne&s;s, not only to <HI>Dara,</HI> but to <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> him&s;elf, who knew the great parts and &s;ubtle Conduct of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and the Courage of <HI>Morad-Bakche;</HI> and who fore&s;aw wery well, that a fire was a kindling, which would be very hard to quench. It was to no purpo&s;e to write Letters upon Let|ters, &s;ignifying that he was well, and giving Order that they &s;hould turn back to their re&s;pective Governments, and expre&s;&s;ing al&s;o, that he would forget all that had pa&s;&s;ed hitherto. All his Letters were not able to hinder their Advance; and as the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did &s;till pa&s;s for mortal, there being no per&s;ons wanting to bring and &s;pread &s;uch News, they &s;till continued to di&s;&s;emble, giving out, that they were <HI>Letters</HI> counterfeited by <HI>Dara;</HI> that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was dead indeed; but that, in ca&s;e he were alive, they would go to ki&s;s his Feet, and deliver him from the hands of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>What then &s;hould <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> this unfortunate King, do, who &s;eeth, that his Sons have no regard to his Orders; who is informed at all hours, that they march apace to|wards <HI>Agra</HI> in the head of their Armics, and who in this conjuncture finds him&s;elf &s;ick to boot in the hands of <HI>Dara,</HI> that is, of a man who breatheth nothing but War; who prepareth for it with all imaginable earne&s;tne&s;s, and with all the marks of an enraged re|&s;entment again&s;t his Brothers; but what could he do in this extremity? He is con&s;trained to abandon to them his Trea&s;ures, and to leave them to their di&s;po&s;al.

<P><HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Dara,</HI> a young Prince of about five and twenty years of Age, very proper of Body, and of good Parts and Conduct, generous, libe|ral, and univer&s;ally beloved, e&s;pecially of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who had already enriched him, and who con&s;idered <HI>him</HI> rather for his Succe&s;&s;or than <HI>Dara,</HI> was he, that was made General of this Army again&s;t <HI>Sujah.</HI> Neverthele&s;s <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who wi&s;hed much ra|ther, that <HI>Sujah</HI> were returned to <HI>Bengale,</HI> than that the matter &s;hould be tryed by a bloody Combat, which could not be but very Tragical, and wherein he run the hazard of lo&s;ing one or other of his Sons, gave him for Companion an Ancient <HI>Raja,</HI> called <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> who is at pre&s;ent one of the powerfulle&s;t and riche&s;t <HI>Rajahs</HI> of all <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tan,</HI> and one of the able&s;t in the whole Kingdom, with a &s;ecret Order not to fight, except it were altogether unavoidable; as al&s;o to endeavour by all means to induce <HI>Sujah</HI> to retire, and to re&s;erve his Forces for a better occa&s;ion; that is to &s;ay, after they &s;hould have &s;een the event of the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and of <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> But this young Prince, <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> full of heat and Cou|rage, breathing after nothing but to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by &s;ome great action, and <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> fearing le&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> gaining a Battle &s;hould fir&s;t make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Capital Towns of the Empire, <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehly;</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> to keep them from a Combat. The two Armies are no &s;ooner in &s;ight of one another, but they prepare to fall on, and they were not long from giving &s;ome Vollies of Can|non. I &s;hall not relate the particulars of this Fight, for, be&s;ides that the narration of it would be too long and tedious, in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory we &s;hall be obliged to de&s;cribe more con&s;iderable ones, by which the Reader will be able to judge of this. 'Tis &s;ufficient to know in general, that the fir&s;t on&s;et was very &s;harp and ob&s;tinate on both &s;ides, but that at length <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> did urge <HI>Sujah</HI> with that force and vigour that he di&s;ordered him, and made him fly: So that if <HI>Je&s;seigne,</HI> and the <HI>Patan Delil-kan,</HI> who was one of the fir&s;t Captains and a valiant Man, but an intimate friend of the <HI>Raja,</HI> and did not act but being moved by him, had &s;econded him in good earne&s;t, 'tis thought that the whole Army of <HI>Sujah</HI> would have been defeated, and him&s;elf in dan|ger of being taken: But that was not the de&s;ign of the <HI>Raja</HI> to de&s;troy him, no more than it was that of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who had given him order to the contrary. Thus then had <HI>Sujah</HI> time to retreat, and that without lo&s;ing any con&s;iderable number of his Men; yet becau&s;e <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> kept the field, and brought away &s;ome pieces of Ar|tillery, it was pre&s;ently bruited at Court, that <HI>Sujah</HI> had been totally overthrown. This Defeat purcha&s;ed great reputation to <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> le&s;&s;ened much the e&s;teem of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and coo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed exceedingly all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that had an inclination for him.</P>
<P>After that &s;ome days were &s;pent in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Sujah,</HI> the Prince <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> who every day received News from the Court, and who learned that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Backche</HI> did approach with great re&s;olution, well knowing, that his Father <HI>Da|ra</HI> had no great &s;tock of Prudence, but good &s;tore of &s;ecret Enemies, re&s;olved to quit the pur&s;uit of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and with all &s;peed to return to <HI>Agra,</HI> where in all appear|ance <HI>Dara</HI> was to give Battel again&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> This was the be&s;t coun&s;el he could take, for no man doubts, that if he could have been there in good time, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would not have had the Advantage; and 'tis even believed, he would never have hazarded the Combat, the Party being too unequal; but the bad fortune of <HI>Dara</HI> did not permit it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all that was thus tran&s;acted towards <HI>Elahas,</HI> which is the place where the <HI>Gemna</HI> is joyned to <HI>Ganges;</HI> the Scene was very different on the &s;ide of <HI>Agra.</HI> At the Court they were much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the River of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and all the other pa&s;&s;ages that were mo&s;t difficult between the Mountains; &s;o that with all ha&s;t they &s;ent away &s;ome Troops to di&s;pute with him the pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>Eugenes,</HI> whil&s;t the whole Army was making ready. For which purpo&s;e there were cho&s;en two of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and the mo&s;t powerful of the Kingdom to command it; the one was <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan,</HI> a Renowned Captain and very affectionate to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> but one that had no great inclination to <HI>Dara,</HI> and who went not but to oblige <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> whom he &s;aw in the hands of <HI>Dara:</HI> The other was <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> a
<PB N="12" REF="341">
potent <HI>Raja,</HI> not inferior to <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> and Son-in-law to that <HI>Raja Rana,</HI> who was at the time of <HI>Ekhar</HI> &s;o pui&s;&s;ant, as if he had been the Emperor of the <HI>Raja</HI>'s. <HI>Dara</HI> at their farewel expre&s;&s;ed to them great kindne&s;s, and pre&s;ented them nobly; but <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> took his time, before their departure, to charge them in &s;ecret, as he had done the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> when he went away in the Expedition again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> with <HI>Soliman Chekouh.</HI> Neither were they wanting, in their March, to &s;end &s;e|veral times to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> to per&s;wade them to turn back: But this was in vain; their Envoys came not again, and the Army advanced with that dili|gence, that they &s;aw it much &s;ooner than they thought upon a ri&s;ing ground, not far remote from the River.</P>
<P>It being then Summer, and the &s;ea&s;on of the greate&s;t heats, the River was fordable; which was the cau&s;e, that at the &s;ame time <HI>Ka&s;em-kan</HI> and the <HI>Raja</HI> prepared them|&s;elves to give Battel; be&s;ides that, they &s;oon knew the re&s;olution of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he would force them, &s;ince that, although his Army was not all come up, he gave them &s;ome Vollies of Cannon; his de&s;ign being to amu&s;e them, fearing le&s;t they them|&s;elves &s;hould pa&s;s the River, not only to prevent his pa&s;&s;age, but al&s;o to hinder his Ar|my from repo&s;ing, and from taking an advantageous po&s;t; which was indeed in great di&s;|order, and &s;o tired by their March, and &s;o faint by the heat, that if at the very fir&s;t it had been a&s;&s;aulted, and kept from pa&s;&s;ing the Water, it would doubtle&s;s have been routed without much re&s;i&s;tance. [I was not by in this fir&s;t Encounter, but thus it was generally di&s;cour&s;ed of, and it agreeth with the after-relation of many of our <HI>French|men,</HI> who &s;erved <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the Artillery.] But they were content to &s;tay at the River-&s;ide, to keep <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> from pa&s;&s;ing it, according to the Order they had re|ceived.</P>
<P>After that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had let his Army re&s;t two or three days, and by amu&s;ing the Enemy, had fitted it to pa&s;s the River, he made his whole Artillery play, which was very well placed; and he commanded, that under the favour of the Cannon they &s;hould pa&s;s the River. <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan</HI> and the <HI>Raja,</HI> on their part, di&s;charged theirs al&s;o, and did what they could to repul&s;e the Enemy, and to keep him from pa&s;&s;ing. The Combat was &s;harp enough at fir&s;t, and very ob&s;tinately maintained by the extraordinary Valour of <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne.</HI> For as to <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan,</HI> although a great Captain, and a &s;tout Man, he gave no great proof of his Valour in this occa&s;ion; yea, &s;ome accu&s;e him of Treachery, charging him that he had in the night cau&s;ed the Bullets and Powder to be hid under the Sand, there being no more of them to be found after two or three di&s;char|ges. However it be, the Combat for all that was, as I &s;aid, very re&s;olutely carried on, and the Pa&s;&s;age long di&s;puted. There were Rocks in the Bed of the River, which did much embara&s;s, and the Banks in many places were very high and difficult to climb up. But at la&s;t, <HI>Morad-Backche</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf into the water with &s;o much re&s;olution and force, and &s;hewed &s;o much valour and boldne&s;s, that there was no re&s;i&s;ting of him. He pa&s;&s;ed over, and with him a good part of the Army, which made <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan</HI> to give back, and ca&s;t <HI>Je&s;som&s;eigne</HI> into great danger of his Per&s;on. For by and by he found the whole Body of the Enemy upon him, and without the extraordinary re&s;olution of his <HI>Ragipous,</HI> who almo&s;t all were killed about him, he had been a dead man. One may judge of the great danger he was in upon this occa&s;ion, by this, that after he had di&s;engaged him&s;elf as well as he could, and was come back to his own, not daring to return to <HI>Agra,</HI> becau&s;e of the great lo&s;s he had &s;uffered, of &s;even or eight thou&s;and <HI>Ragipous</HI> he had but five or &s;ix hundred of them remaining.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Ragipous,</HI> who take their name from the <HI>Rajas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Children of the <HI>Ra|jas,</HI> are from Father to Son &s;uch Men as make the Sword their Profe&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Rajas,</HI> who&s;e Subjects they are, do a&s;&s;ign them Lands for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, on condition to be always rea|dy to go to War when &s;ummoned. So that one might &s;ay, that they were a &s;ort of Pagan Nobles, if the <HI>Rajas</HI> gave them their Lands in propriety for them and their Children. They are great takers of <HI>Opium;</HI> and I have &s;ometimes wondred at the quantity I have &s;een them take: They accu&s;tom them&s;elves to it from their youth. On the day of Battel they double the Do&s;e, this Drug animating, or rather inebriating them, and making them in&s;en|&s;ible of danger; in&s;omuch that they ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Combate like &s;o many furious Bea&s;ts, not knowing what it is to run away, but dying at the feet of their <HI>Raja,</HI> when he &s;tands to it. They want nothing but Order, Re&s;olution they have enough. 'Tis a plea&s;ure thus to &s;ee them, with the fume of <HI>Opium</HI> in their Head to embrace one another, when the Battel is to begin, and to give their mutual Farewels, as men re&s;ol|ved

to dye. And that they do for this rea&s;on; that the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> though a <HI>Mahu|metan,</HI> and by con&s;equence an Enemy of the Heathen, yet for all that entertains always a good number of <HI>Rajas</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;ervice, whom he con&s;iders as his other <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and imploys in his Armies as if they were <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot forbear to relate here the fierce reception, which the Daughter of the <HI>Rana</HI> gave to her Husband <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> after his defeat and flight. When &s;he heard that he was nigh, and had under&s;tood what had pa&s;&s;ed in the Battel; that he had fought with all po&s;&s;ible courage; that he had but four or five hundred Men left; and that at la&s;t, not being able to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t any longer the Enemy, he had been obliged to retreat: She, in &s;tead of &s;ending one to receive him, and to condole him in his misfortunes, commanded in a dry mood to &s;hut the Gates of the Ca&s;tle, and not to let this infamous Man enter; that he was not her Husband; that &s;he would never &s;ee him; that the Son-in-law of the Great <HI>Rana,</HI> could not have &s;o low a Soul; that he was to remember, that being grafted into &s;o Illu&s;trious an Hou&s;e, he was to imitate the Virtue of it; and, in a word, that he was either to vanqui&s;h, or to dye. A moment after &s;he was of another humour; &s;he commands a Pile of Wood to be laid, that &s;he might burn her &s;elf, that they abus'd her; that her Husband mu&s;t needs be dead; that it could not be otherwi&s;e. And a little while after this, &s;he was &s;een to change her countenance, to fall into pa&s;&s;ion, and to break out into a thou&s;and reproaches again&s;t him. In &s;hort, &s;he remained thus tran&s;ported eight or nine days, without being able to re&s;olve to &s;ee her Husband, 'till at la&s;t her Mo|ther coming in, brought her in &s;ome degree to her &s;elf, and comforted her, a&s;&s;uring her, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Raja</HI> had but a little refre&s;h'd him&s;elf, he would rai&s;e another Army, to fight <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and repair his Honour at any rate.</P>
<P>By which &s;tory one may &s;ee a pattern of the Courage of the Women in that Coun|trey: To which I could add &s;omething I have &s;een &s;ome of them do, who burned them&s;elves alive after the death of their Husbands; but we mu&s;t re&s;erve this Di&s;cour&s;e for another place, where I &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew, that there is nothing which opinion, prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, cu&s;tom, hope, and the point of honour, &amp;c. may not make Men do or &s;uffer.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> having under&s;tood what had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Eugenes,</HI> fell into that choler again&s;t <HI>Ka&s;em Kan,</HI> that it was thought he would have cut off his Head, if he had been upon the place. He was al&s;o tran&s;ported again&s;t <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> as the Per&s;on that was the fir&s;t and principal cau&s;e of the Misfortune, and who had furni&s;h'd <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> with Men, Money, and Cannon. He is ready to kill his Son <HI>Mahmet Emir-Kan,</HI> and will &s;end his Wife and Daughter to <HI>Ba&s;ar,</HI> or the Market-place of pro&s;tituted Women; and 'tis pa&s;t doubt, that he would have done &s;ome &s;uch thing, if <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> with much art and prudence, had not moderated the exce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion, in remon&s;trating to him, that <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> had not &s;o little conduct, nor &s;o great a friend&s;hip for <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as to hazard, and in a manner to &s;acrifice his Family, for the advancing of his Intere&s;t; that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> mu&s;t needs have gulled and en&s;nared him, by his u&s;ual artifice and cun|ning.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> the happy &s;ucce&s;s of this fir&s;t Encounter did &s;o &s;well their hearts, and gave &s;uch Courage to their whole Army, that henceforth they believed them&s;elves invincible, and capable to compa&s;s any thing. Be&s;ides, <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the more to animate his Soldiers, bragged openly, that he had Thirty thou&s;and <HI>Mogols</HI> at his devotion in the Army of <HI>Dara;</HI> and there was &s;omething in it, as appeared by the &s;equel. <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was for nothing but fighting, and would march with all dili|gence. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> repre&s;ented to him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary the Army &s;hould re|fre&s;h them&s;elves for &s;ome time upon the Banks of this &s;weet River; that in the mean time he would write to all his Friends, and get a full and certain information of the &s;tate of the Court, and of the condition of all Affairs. So that he marched not towards <HI>Agra,</HI> 'till he had re&s;ted &s;ome days, and after that he marched but &s;lowly, to inform him&s;elf of all, and to take his time and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> when he plainly &s;aw the re&s;olution of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Mo|rad-Bakche,</HI> and that there was no hope left to make them turn back, he was in &s;uch a perplexity, that he knew not what to re&s;olve, and fore&s;eeing &s;ome great calamity, he would &s;ain have hindred the la&s;t deci&s;ive Battel, for which he &s;aw <HI>Dara</HI> preparing him|&s;elf with great eagerne&s;s. But what could he do to oppo&s;e it? He was yet too weak of his &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;aw him&s;elf &s;till in the hands of <HI>Dara,</HI> whom, as I have &s;aid, he tru&s;ted not much: So that he found him&s;elf obliged to acquie&s;ee in his Will, and to com|mit
<PB N="14" REF="342">
to him all the Forces of the Empire, and to command all Captains to obey him. Immediately all was in Arms: I know not, whether there was ever a more gallant Ar|my &s;een in <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, that there were little le&s;s than an Hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and Twenty thou&s;and Foot, with Four thou&s;and pieces of Cannon, without reckoning the incredible number of Servants, Followers, Victuallers, whom Hi&s;torians, methinks, do often put into the number of the Combatants, when they &s;peak of tho&s;e formidable Armies of Three or four hundred thou&s;and men, of which their Books are full. Though this Army was very brave, and &s;trong enough to cut in pieces two or three of &s;uch as <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had, in which there were no more than Thirty Five or Forty thou|&s;and men in all, and the&s;e tired and hara&s;&s;ed by a very long and irk&s;om march, during the height of the Heats; and but a &s;mall number of Cannon, in re&s;pect of that of <HI>Dara.</HI> Mean time (which &s;eems hard to believe) there was &s;carce any Body that pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;aged well for <HI>Dara,</HI> all knowing, that mo&s;t of the chief <HI>Omrahs</HI> had no affection for him, and that all the good Soldiers that were for him, and whom he might confide in, were in the Army of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> his Son. And 'twas for this rea&s;on, that the mo&s;t prudent and the mo&s;t faithful of his Friends, and <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> him&s;elf, coun&s;elled him, not to hazard a Battel: <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> offering, as infirm as he was, that he would go in|to the Field him&s;elf, and be carried before <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to interpo&s;e; which was looked upon as a very good Expedient for Peace, and for accommodating the Affairs of <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> For 'tis certain, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> would never have had the boldne&s;s to fight again&s;t their own Father; and if they &s;hould have attempted it, they would have &s;marted for it, becau&s;e, be&s;ides that the match was not equal, and all the great <HI>Omrahs</HI> were &s;o affectionate to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that they would not have failed to fight re&s;olutely, if they had &s;een him in the head of the Army; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, the Cap|tains them&s;elves of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> bore great affection and re&s;pect to this Prince, who&s;e Creatures they mo&s;t were; and the whole Army, in a manner, was his. So that in all appearance, not one of them would have pre&s;umed to draw his Sword again&s;t him, nor he been at the pains of drawing his.</P>
<P>Then they advi&s;ed <HI>Dara,</HI> that if he would not hearken to this Expedient, he &s;hould at lea&s;t not precipitate the bu&s;ine&s;s, but delay, 'till <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> who made all ha&s;te to join, were come in. Which was al&s;o very good coun&s;el, in regard that that Prince was beloved of all, and was lately come home victorious, and had the mo&s;t faithful and the brave&s;t Soldiers with him. But <HI>Dara</HI> would never hearken to any Propo&s;ition that could be made to him, and he thought on nothing el&s;e but to give Battel pre&s;ently, and to go again&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in per&s;on. And po&s;&s;ibly he did not ami&s;s, as to his own Ho|nour and particular Intere&s;t, if he could have commanded Fortune, and made things &s;uc|ceed as he contrived them. For the Con&s;iderations he had (as he could not forbear now and then to di&s;cover) were &s;ome &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P>He looked upon him&s;elf as Ma&s;ter of the per&s;on of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> that he could di&s;|po&s;e of him as he plea&s;ed; that he was al&s;o Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all the Trea&s;ures and Forces of the Empire; that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was half ruined; that his two other Brothers, with a weak and tired Army, were come to ca&s;t them&s;elves into his hands; that, if he gained the Battel, they could not e&s;cape him; that he &s;hould all at once be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, and at the end of all his troubles, and at the height of his wi&s;hes, &s;o as no body could con|tradict him in any thing, or di&s;pute the Crown with him. Whereas if <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;hould take the Field, all Affairs would be accommodated, his Brothers would return to their Governments, <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who began to recover his health, would re&s;ume the Government as before, and all things would return into their fir&s;t Channel: That, if he &s;hould &s;tay for <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> his Son, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> might take &s;ome de&s;ign to his di&s;|advantage, or contrive &s;omething with <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> that whatever he could do for gaining the Victory, the Reputation which <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> had purcha&s;ed, would &s;till give him all the honour of it. And after that, what would not he be capable to undertake, &s;welled with &s;o much glory and &s;ucce&s;s, and e&s;pecially being &s;upported, as he was, by the favour and affection of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and of the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Omrahs?</HI> What did he know, whether he would keep any mode&s;ty, or any re&s;pect for him, and whither his Ambition might not carry him?</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations made <HI>Dara</HI> re&s;olve to &s;tand out again&s;t the coun&s;el of all, and to pur&s;ue his Point. And for that purpo&s;e, he commanded immediately the whole Army to take the Field, and thereupon came to take leave of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who was in the For|tre&s;s

of <HI>Agra.</HI> This good old Man was ready to melt in tears, when he embraced him; but withal failed not to repre&s;ent to him, with a very grave countenance: Well, <HI>Dara&punc;</HI> &s;ince thou art re&s;olved to follow thine own Will, Go, God ble&s;s thee, but remember well the&s;e few words: <HI>If thou lo&s;e&s;t the Battel, take beed of ever coming into my Pre&s;ence.</HI> But this made no great impre&s;&s;ion upon him; he goeth forth briskly, taketh Hor&s;e, and &s;eizeth on the Pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hembel,</HI> which is about twenty miles from <HI>Agra;</HI> where he fortified him&s;elf, expecting his Enemy. But the &s;ubtile and crafty <HI>Fakire,</HI> who wanted no good Spies, and People that gave him intelligence of all, and who knew that the Pa&s;&s;age was there very difficult, took good heed to attempt the foreing it. He came to encamp him&s;elf near it, &s;o that from the Camp of <HI>Dara</HI> one might di&s;cover his Tents. But what doth he in the mean time? He inveigles a certain Rebel of <HI>Raja,</HI> called <HI>Chem|pet,</HI> pre&s;ents him richly, and promi&s;eth him a thou&s;and fine things, if he would let him pa&s;s thorough his Territories, that &s;o he might go with &s;peed to gain a certain place, where he knew that the River might be pa&s;&s;ed on foot with ea&s;e. <HI>Chempet</HI> agreeth, and offers of his own accord, that he would him&s;elf attend him, and &s;hew him the way through the Woods and Hills of his Countrey. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> rai&s;ed his Camp the &s;ame night, without any noi&s;e, leaving &s;ome of his Tents to amu&s;e <HI>Dara,</HI> and marching night and day, made &s;uch ha&s;te, that he was almo&s;t as &s;oon on the other &s;ide of the River, as <HI>Dara</HI> could have notice of it. Which obliged <HI>Dara</HI> to abandon the River there, and to leave all his Fortifications, and to follow his Enemy, who, he was told, did advance with great diligence towards <HI>Agra,</HI> to gain the River of <HI>Gemna,</HI> and there without trouble, and at his ea&s;e, to enjoy the water, to fortifie, and to fix him&s;elf well, and &s;o to expect <HI>Dara.</HI> The place where he encamped is but five Leagues from <HI>Agra,</HI> it was formerly called <HI>Samonguer,</HI> and now <HI>Fateabad,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Place of Victory.</HI> A little while after, <HI>Dara</HI> al&s;o came to encamp there, nigh the Bank of the &s;ame River, between <HI>Agra,</HI> and the Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>The two Armies were there between three and four days in &s;ight of one another, without fighting. Mean time <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> wrote &s;everal Letters to <HI>Dara,</HI> that <HI>Soliman Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kouh</HI> was not far off; that he &s;hould not precipitate; that he &s;hould come near <HI>Agra,</HI> and chu&s;e an advantageous place to fortifie him&s;elf 'till he came. But <HI>Dara</HI> an&s;wered, that before three days were pa&s;&s;ed, he would bring to him <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> tyed hand and foot, to do with them what he &s;hould think fit. And without expecting any longer, he began at that very hour to put his Army in Battel-Array.</P>
<P>He placed in the Front all his Cannon, cau&s;ing them to be tyed the one to the other with Chains, to &s;hut the pa&s;&s;age to the Cavalry. Behind the&s;e Peeces of Cannon, he placed al&s;o front-wi&s;e a great number of light Camels, on the forepart of the Bodies, whereof they fa&s;ten a &s;mall Peece, of the bigne&s;s of a double Mu&s;quet; a Man &s;itting on the hind-part of the Camel, being able to charge and di&s;charge without lighting. Behind the&s;e Camels &s;tood the greate&s;t part of the Mu&s;queteers. Of the re&s;t of the Ar|my, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in Cavalry, furni&s;h'd with Bows and Arrows, (as ordinarily are the <HI>Mogols,</HI> that is, at pre&s;ent, White Men, Mahumetans, &s;trangers, as <HI>Per&s;ians, Turks, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>&V;sbecks;)</HI> or with a Sword, and a kind of Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">-pike, as com|monly are the <HI>Ragipous:</HI> Of all the&s;e, I &s;ay, there were made three different Bodies. The right Wing was committed to <HI>Calil-ullah-Kan,</HI> with thirty thou&s;and <HI>Mogols</HI> under his Command; for he was made Great <HI>Bakchis,</HI> that is, Great Ma&s;ter of the Cavalry, in the place of <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> that was afterwards my <HI>Agah,</HI> who voluntarily re&s;igned this Office, &s;eeing that he was not well-beloved of <HI>Dara,</HI> for having always highly maintained again&s;t him the Intere&s;t and Authority of <HI>Chah Jehan.</HI> The left Wing was given to <HI>Ru&s;tam-Kan Dakny,</HI> a very renowned and very valiant Captain, together with the <HI>Raja Chatre&s;ale,</HI> and the <HI>Raja Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> put al&s;o their Army almo&s;t into the &s;ame Order; except that in the mid&s;t of the Troops of &s;ome <HI>Omrahs,</HI> they had hid &s;ome &s;mall Field-Peeces, which was, as was &s;aid, after the Way and Art of <HI>Emir-Jem|la,</HI> and with no ill effect.</P>
<P>They hardly made u&s;e of any more Art, than what hath been now related; only they placed here and there &s;ome M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n ca&s;ting <HI>Bannes,</HI> which is a kind of Granado fa&s;tened to a &s;tick, that may be ca&s;t very far through the Cavalry, and which extremely terrifieth Hor&s;es, and even hurts and kills &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>All this Cavalry turns about very ea&s;ily, and they draw their Arrows with marvellous
<PB N="16" REF="343">
&s;wiftne&s;s; one Man being able to draw &s;ix of them, before a Mu&s;queteer can twice di&s;charge his Mu&s;quet. The &s;ame Cavalry keeps al&s;o very clo&s;e in &s;everal Troops un|der their re&s;pective Officers, e&s;pecially when they are going to fight hand to hand. But after all, I &s;ee not, that this way of putting an Army in Array, is any great matter, in compari&s;on of our Armies, when in good order.</P>
<P>All things being thus di&s;po&s;ed, the Artillery began to play on both &s;ides; for 'tis al|ways the Cannon that makes the prelude among&s;t <HI>them;</HI> and the Arrows were now &s;een to fly through the Air, when unexpectedly there hapned to fall a Storm of Rain, &s;o violent, that it interrupted the Combat. The Rain cea&s;ing, the Cannon began afre&s;h to roar; and then it was that <HI>Dara</HI> appeared, who being mounted upon a proud Ele|phant of <HI>Ceilau,</HI> commanded that an On&s;et &s;hould be made on all &s;ides; and him&s;elf ad|vanced into the mid&s;t of the Body of the Cavalry, directly towards the Enemies Ar|tillery, who received him warmly, kill'd &s;tore of Men about him, and put into di&s;or|der, not only the main Body which he commanded, but al&s;o the other Bodies of the Cavalry that followed him. Yet notwith&s;tanding, becau&s;e he was &s;een to keep firm upon his Elephant, without any appearance of giving back, and was ob&s;erved to look every where about him with an undaunted look, and to make &s;igns with his hands to advance and follow him, this di&s;order &s;oon cea&s;ed, every one re&s;uming his Rank, and advancing in the &s;ame place with <HI>Dara.</HI> But he could not reach the Enemy, with|out receiving another Volley of Cannon-&s;hot, which cau&s;ed a &s;econd and great di&s;order in his Men, and made a good part of them r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">coil; yet he, without any change in his Countenance, &s;tood to it, encouraging his Troops, and gave &s;till &s;igns, that they &s;hould follow him, and advance with &s;peed without any lo&s;s of time. Thus pre&s;&s;ing vigo|rou&s;ly forward, he forced the Enemies Artillery, broke the Chains, entred into their Camp, and made a Rout in their Camels and Infantry, and in every thing he met with on that &s;ide; opening al&s;o a good pa&s;&s;age to the Cavalry that followed him. Then it was, that the Enemies Cavalry facing him, a &s;ore Combat began. A &s;howre of Arrows filled the Air from both &s;ides, <HI>Dara</HI> him&s;elf putting his hand to that work: But, to &s;ay truth, the&s;e Arrows do but little Execution; more of them are lo&s;t in the Air, or bro|ken on the ground, than hit. The fir&s;t di&s;charges of Arrows being made, they fought hand to hand with their Sables, <HI>pe&s;le me&s;le,</HI> and the Combat was &s;toutly maintained on both &s;ides. <HI>Dara</HI> is &s;till &s;een to continue firm on his Elephant, encouraging, making a noi&s;e, and giving &s;igns on all &s;ides; and at la&s;t advancing with &s;o much re&s;olution and force, again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed him in his March, that he overthrew the Cavalry, and made them to retire and run away.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who was not far from thence, and mounted al&s;o on an Elephant, &s;ee|ing this great di&s;order, was in great trouble, and laboured with all his might to remedy it; but to no purpo&s;e. He made the main Body of his be&s;t Cavalry advance, to try whether he could make head again&s;t <HI>Dara;</HI> but it was not long before this Body al&s;o was forced to give back, and to retreat in great di&s;order, whatever <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could &s;ay or do to hinder it. Mean time let us take notice of his courage and re&s;olution: He &s;aw that almo&s;t the whole Body of his Army was di&s;ordered, and in a flying po&s;ture, in&s;omuch that he had not a thou&s;and Men about him that kept their &s;tanding; (&s;ome told me, that there were &s;carce five hundred:) He &s;aw, that <HI>Dara,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the difficulty of the way, which was uneven, and full of holes in divers places, made as if he would ru&s;h in upon him: Yet, for all this, he lo&s;t no courage, and was &s;o far from being &s;truck with fear, or from retreating, that he &s;tood firmly to it, and called by name mo&s;t of his Captains that were about him, crying out to them, <HI>Delirane Kodah&eacute;,</HI> (the&s;e are his own words,) that is, <HI>Courage my old Friends, God is:</HI> What hope is there in flying? Know you not, where is our <HI>Decan? Kodah&eacute;, Kodah&eacute;, God is, God is.</HI> And that none might doubt of his being undaunted, and that he thought on nothing le&s;s than running away, he commanded before them all (oh &s;trange extremity!) that forth|with Chains &s;hould be fa&s;tned to the feet of his Elephant; and was going to fa&s;ten them in good earne&s;t, but that they all declared their courage and re&s;olution, to live and dye with him.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> in the interim endeavoured to advance upon <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> though he was yet at a good di&s;tance from him, and though the difficulty of the way embara&s;&s;ed and retarded him much; he meeting al&s;o with &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, even from tho&s;e di&s;ordered Hor&s;e of the Enemy, that covered all high and low places where he was to march. And this Encounter with <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was looked upon as <HI>the</HI> thing, that was to a&s;&s;ure <HI>Dara</HI> of
<PB N="17" REF="343">
the Victory, and to decide the Battel. And doubtle&s;s, he would have overcome all the&s;e difficulties, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> with the &s;mall number left him, would not have been able to bid head to this Victorious Army, if <HI>Dara</HI> had known how to profit of the prize he had in his hands. But here he failed; of which I &s;hall now &s;hew the occa&s;ion, and how thereby the Scale was turned to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> perceived that his left Wing was in great di&s;order, and he was informed, that <HI>Ru&s;tam-Kan</HI> and <HI>Chatre&s;ale</HI> were killed; that <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;</HI> had too far advanced, that he had indeed forced the Enemy, and made way through the mid&s;t of them; but that now he was &s;urrounded every way, and in very great danger. This it was, which made <HI>Dara</HI> de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign of making directly towards <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he might go to &s;uccour his left Wing. There at fir&s;t the Battel was al&s;o very &s;harp, but <HI>Dara</HI> at la&s;t carried it, forcing and routing all, yet &s;o, as that there &s;till remained &s;omething that re&s;i&s;ted and &s;topped him. Mean time, <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;</HI> fought with &s;o much cou|rage and vigour as was po&s;&s;ible. He wounded <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and came &s;o near him, that he began to cut the Girdles of his Elephant, to make him fall down; but the valour and good fortune of <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> gave not time enough for it. In &s;hort, never any Man fought and defended him&s;elf more bravely, than <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> did on this occa&s;i|on: All wounded as he was, and pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Ragipous</HI> of <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;,</HI> who were round about him, he was not daunted, nor gave way in the lea&s;t, but knew &s;o well to take his time, that although he was, be&s;ides defending him&s;elf, to cover with his &s;hield a Son of his, but of &s;even or eight years of Age, who was &s;itting on his &s;ide, he made an Arrow-&s;hot &s;o luckily at <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;,</HI> that it made him fall dead to the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> &s;oon heard the &s;ad News of this Accident; but at the &s;ame time he under&s;tood al&s;o, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was in very great danger; the <HI>Ragipous</HI> fighting furiou&s;ly, and like Lions, to revenge the death of their Ma&s;ter. And though he &s;aw, on that &s;ide the way was very difficult, and that he &s;till found &s;ome &s;mall Body oppo&s;ing and retarding him; yet he was determined to ru&s;h through to <HI>Morad-Backche:</HI> And doubt|le&s;s this was the be&s;t he could do, and that, which was capable to repair the fault he had committed in not doing his bu&s;ine&s;s thoroughly with <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> But his bad fortune kept him from it, or rather, one of the blacke&s;t Treacheries that ever was ima|gined, and the greate&s;t over&s;ight that was ever committed, did cau&s;e the entire lo&s;s and ruin of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calil-ullah-Kan</HI> (he that commanded the thirty thou&s;and <HI>Mogols,</HI> which made the right Wing, and were alone able to defeat the whole Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> did, whil&s;t <HI>Dara</HI> and his left Wing fought with &s;o much courage and &s;ucce&s;s, keep off, as idle as if he were not concerned in the fray, not permitting any one of his Hor&s;emen to &s;hoot an Arrow, with a pretence, that they were for a Re&s;erve, and that he had ex|pre&s;s Order not to fight but in the la&s;t extremity. But the true cau&s;e was, that he re|&s;erved in his brea&s;t the rancour of an old Affront, done him by <HI>Dara,</HI> when he com|manded him to be &s;truck. But after all, this Treachery would have done no great mi&s;chief, if this infamous Man had contented him&s;elf with this fir&s;t Effect of his Re|&s;entment: Behold, how far he carried his rage, and revengefulne&s;s! He cut him&s;elf off from his main Body, and taking only a few men with him, rid with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed towards <HI>Dara,</HI> at the &s;ame time when he was turning to fall on <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and being come &s;o near as to make him&s;elf be heard, cryed out with all his force; <HI>Mohba|reck-bad, Hazaret, Salamet, Elhamdul-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lla;</HI> God &s;ave your Maje&s;ty, you have obtain|ed the Victory; what will you do any longer upon your Elephant? Is it not enough, that you have expo&s;ed your &s;elf &s;o long? if the lea&s;t of tho&s;e &s;hots, that have been made into your <HI>Dais,</HI> had reached your Per&s;on, what would have become of us? Are there Traitors wanting in this Army? In the Name of God come down quickly and take Hor&s;e. What remains more to be done, than to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Run-aways. Let us do &s;o, nor let us &s;uffer that they &s;houlde e&s;cape our hands!</P>
<P>If <HI>Dara</HI> had had wit enough to di&s;cover the cheat, and to con&s;ider upon a &s;udden the con&s;equences of his not appearing any more upon the Elephant, and being no more &s;een by the whole Army, always eying him, or rather, if he had pre&s;ently com|manded to cut off the Head of this Para&s;itical Traitor, he had been Ma&s;ter of all. But the good Prince &s;uffered him&s;elf to be blinded by the&s;e &s;weet words: He hearkned to this advice, as if it had been very true and very &s;incere; he de&s;cended from his Elephant,
<PB N="18" REF="344">
and took Hor&s;e. But I know not whether there pa&s;&s;ed one quarter of an hour, but he perceived the Treachery of <HI>Calil ullah-Kan,</HI> and repented him&s;elf extremely of the great fault he had committed. He looks about him, he &s;eeketh, he asketh where he is; he &s;aith, he is a Traitor, he will kill him. But the perfidious Villain is by this time at a good di&s;tance; the occa&s;ion is lo&s;t. Would it be believed, that as &s;oon as the Army perceived <HI>Dara</HI> to be no more upon the Elephant, they imagined that there was Trea&s;on, that <HI>Dara</HI> was killed; and all were &s;truck with &s;uch a terror, that every one thought on nothing, but how to e&s;cape the hands of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to &s;ave him|&s;elf? What &s;hall I &s;ay? All the Army disbands and &s;lyeth. A &s;udden and &s;trange re|volution! He that &s;aw him&s;elf ju&s;t now Victorious, finds him&s;elf in a few moments vanqui&s;hed, abandoned, and obliged to fly him&s;elf to &s;ave his life. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> by holding out firm a quarter of an hour upon his Elephant, &s;eeth the Crown of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> upon his Head; and <HI>Dara</HI> for having come down a little too &s;oon, &s;eeth him&s;elf preci|pitated from the Throne, and the mo&s;t unfortunate Prince of the World. Thus For|tune taketh plea&s;ure, to make the gain or lo&s;s of a Battel, and the deci&s;ion of a great Empire, depend upon a nothing.</P>
<P>The&s;e great and prodigious Armies, 'tis true, do &s;ometimes great things; but when once terror &s;ei&s;eth, and di&s;order comes among them, what means of &s;topping the Com|motion? 'Tis like a great River broke through its Dams; it mu&s;t overrun all, without a Remedy. Whence it is, that as often as I con&s;ider the condition of &s;uch Armies, de&s;ti|tute of good order, and marching like flocks of Sheep, I per&s;wade my &s;elf, that, if in the&s;e parts one might &s;ee an Army of five and twenty thou&s;and men, of tho&s;e old Troops of <HI>Flanders,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Prince,</HI> or <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Turenne,</HI> I doubt not at all, but they would trample under foot all tho&s;e Armies, how numerous &s;o|ever they were. And this it is, that now maketh me not find it any longer &s;trange or in|credible, what we are told of ten thou&s;and <HI>Greeks;</HI> and of fifty thou&s;and Men of <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> overcoming &s;ix or &s;even hundred thou&s;and Men of <HI>Darius;</HI> (if it be true, that there were &s;o many, and that the Hi&s;torian did not reckon the Servants, and all tho&s;e numbers of Men, which were to follow the Army, to furni&s;h it with Forrage, Cattle, Corn, and all other nece&s;&s;aries.) Bear only the fir&s;t brunt, which would be no very difficult thing for us to do; and behold, they are all a&s;toni&s;hed: Or, do like <HI>Alexander,</HI> &s;et vigorou&s;ly upon one place, if that hold not out, (which will be very hard for them to do) you may be &s;ure the work is done; all the re&s;t pre&s;ently take fright and flight together.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> encouraged by &s;uch a wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, is not wanting to turn every &s;tone, to employ skill, dexterity, &s;ubtilty, craft, courage, to profit by all the Advan|tages, which &s;o favourable an occa&s;ion puts into his hands. <HI>Calil-ullah-Kan</HI> is pre&s;ently with him, offering him his Service, and all the Troops he could be Ma&s;ter of. He, on his &s;ide, wants not words of thanks and acknowledgments, nor a thou&s;and fair Pro|mi&s;es: But he was very cautious to receive him in his own name; he carried him pre|&s;ently and pre&s;ented him to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> who, as we may ea&s;ily think, received him with open Arms; <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the mean time congratulating and prai&s;ing <HI>Morad-Bak|che,</HI> for having fought &s;o valiantly, and a&s;cribing to him all the honour of the Victory; treating him with the title of King and Maje&s;ty before <HI>Calil-ullah-Kan,</HI> giving him un|common re&s;pect, and doing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him becoming a Subject and Servant. In the interim, he labours night and day for him&s;elf, he writeth round about to all the <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> making &s;ure to day of one, and next day of another. <HI>Chah-he&s;t-Kan,</HI> his Uncle, the great and old Enemy of <HI>Dara,</HI> by rea&s;on of an Affront he had received from him, did the &s;ame for him on his part; and as he is the Per&s;on who writeth be&s;t and &s;ubtil|le&s;t of the Empire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> &s;o he contributed not a little by his Cabals to the ad|vancement of the Affairs of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> making &s;trong Parties every where again&s;t <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time let us &s;till ob&s;erve the artifice and di&s;&s;imulation of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> Nothing of what he doth, treateth, promi&s;eth, is for him&s;elf, or in his own Name; he hath &s;till (for&s;ooth) the de&s;ign of living as a <HI>Fakire:</HI> all is for <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> 'tis he that commands; <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> doth nothing; 'tis <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> doth all, 'tis he that is de&s;igned to be King.</P>
<P>As for the unhappy <HI>Dara,</HI> he comes with all &s;peed to <HI>Agra,</HI> in a de&s;perate condition, and not daring to go &s;ee <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> remembring, doubtle&s;s, tho&s;e &s;evere words which he
<PB N="19" REF="344">
let fall, when he took leave of him before the Battel, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould remember not to come before him, if he were overcome. Yet, for all that, the good old Father &s;ent &s;ecretly a tru&s;ty Eunuch to him, to comfort him, to a&s;&s;ure him of the continuance of his affection, to declare to him his trouble for his misfortune, and to remon&s;trate to him, that the ca&s;e was not yet de&s;perate, con&s;idering that there was a good Army with <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> his Son, that he &s;hould go to <HI>Dehli,</HI> where he &s;hould find a thou&s;and Hor&s;e in the Royal Stables; and <HI>that</HI> the Governor of the Fortre&s;s had Order to fur|ni&s;h him with Money and Elephants; for the re&s;t, <HI>that</HI> he &s;hould not go further than he needs mu&s;t; <HI>that</HI> he would often write to him: And la&s;tly, <HI>that</HI> he very well knew how to find out and cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Aurenge-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>I have been informed, that <HI>Dara</HI> was then in &s;uch a confu&s;ion, and &s;unk &s;o low, that he had not the power to an&s;wer a word to the Eunuch, nor the courage to &s;end any one to <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> but that, after having &s;ent &s;everal times to <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> his Si&s;ter, he went away at midnight, taking with him his Wife, his Daughters, and his Grand|child <HI>Sepe-Chekouh;</HI> and that (which is almo&s;t incredible) he was attended with not above three or four hundred per&s;ons. Let us leave him in his Voyage to <HI>Dehli,</HI> and &s;tay at <HI>Agra,</HI> to con&s;ider the dexterity and craft, wherewith <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> proceeded to ma|nage Affairs.</P>
<P>He well knew, that <HI>Dara,</HI> and tho&s;e of his Party, could yet place &s;ome hopes in the victorious Army of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> and therefore he re&s;olved to take it from him, or to make it u&s;ele&s;s to him. To this end, he wrote Letters upon Letters to the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> and to <HI>Delil-Kan,</HI> who were the chief Heads of the Army of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> telling them, that there was no hope left for <HI>Dara</HI> and his Party; that he had lo&s;t the Battel; that his whole Army had &s;ubmitted to him; that all had abandon'd him; that he was fled alone towards <HI>Dehli;</HI> that he could never e&s;cape him, and that Orders were di&s;tributed every where to &s;eize on him. And as for <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that he was in a con|dition hopele&s;s of recovery; that they &s;hould take good care of what they had to do; and if they were Men of under&s;tanding, and would follow his fortune, and be his Friends, they &s;hould &s;eize on <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> and bring him to him.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> found him&s;elf perplexed enough, what he &s;hould do, &s;till much apprehend|ing <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> and <HI>Dara,</HI> and more, to lay hands upon a Royal Per&s;on, well know|ing, that &s;ome mi&s;chief might therefore fall on him, &s;ooner or later, even from <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, he knew that <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> had too much courage to let him&s;elf be taken after that manner, and that he would rather die in defending of him&s;elf. Behold therefore, what he at la&s;t re&s;olved! After having taken coun&s;el with <HI>Delil-Kan,</HI> his great Friend, and after they had renewed to one another the Oath of mutual Fide|lity, he went directly to the Tent of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> who with great impatience ex|pected him, (for he al&s;o had heard the News of the Defeat of <HI>Dara</HI> his father) and had already divers times &s;ent for him. To him he frankly di&s;covered all things, &s;hewed him the Letter of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> told him what cour&s;e was be&s;t for him to take, repre&s;ented to him the danger he was in; that there was no rea&s;on he &s;hould tru&s;t in <HI>De|lil-Kan,</HI> or in <HI>Daoud-Kan,</HI> or in the re&s;t of his Army; but that, as &s;oon as he could, he &s;hould gain the Mountains of <HI>Serenaguer;</HI> that that was the be&s;t Expedient he could take; that the <HI>Raja</HI> of that Countrey being in unacce&s;&s;ible places, and not apprehen|ding <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> would doubtle&s;s receive him gladly; and; for the re&s;t, he would &s;oon &s;ee how things would go, and be always in a condition to come down from the Mountains, when he &s;hould think good.</P>
<P>The young Prince under&s;tood well enough by this kind of di&s;cour&s;e, that there was no ground to tru&s;t henceforth in this <HI>Raja,</HI> and that there was no more &s;afety for his Per&s;on; and that the rather, becau&s;e he knew that <HI>Delil-Kan</HI> was altogether devoted to him, and he &s;aw well enough, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity to take this cour&s;e &s;ugge&s;t|ed. Whereupon he &s;oon commanded, that his Baggage &s;hould be put up to march to|wards the Mountains. Some of his mo&s;t affectionate Friends, as a good number of <HI>Man&s;eb-Dars,</HI> of <HI>Sajeds,</HI> and others, put them&s;elves in order to attend him; the re&s;t of the Army, altogether a&s;toni&s;hed, remain'd with the <HI>Raja.</HI> But that, which was ve|ry mean for a great <HI>Raja,</HI> and a very &s;ordid barbarou&s;ne&s;s, was, that he and <HI>Delil-Kan</HI> &s;ent under hand &s;ome to fall upon his Baggage, who al&s;o took other things, and among them an Elephant laden with Rupies of Gold, which cau&s;ed a great di&s;order among tho&s;e &s;mall Troops that followed him; and which was an occa&s;ion, that many of them
<PB N="20" REF="345">
return'd and abandon'd him; and invited al&s;o the Country-people to &s;et upon his Men, pillaging them, and even killing &s;ome of them: Yet he made a &s;hift to gain the Moun|tains, with his Wife and Children, where the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Serenaguer</HI> received him with all the honour and civilities he could de&s;ire, a&s;&s;uring him, that he was in &s;afety, as much as if he were King of that Countrey, and that he would protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his Forces. In the mean time, behold what hapned on <HI>Agra</HI>'s &s;ide.</P>
<P>Three or four days after the Battel of <HI>Samonguer,</HI> the Victorious <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> toge|ther with <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> came directly to the Gate of the Town into a Garden, which may be a little League di&s;tant from the Fortre&s;s, and &s;ent from thence an able Eunuch, and one of tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t confided in, to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> to &s;alute him with a thou|&s;and fair Prote&s;tations of his affection and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; that he was exceedingly &s;orry for what had pa&s;&s;ed, and for having been obliged, by rea&s;on of the ambition and evil de|&s;igns of <HI>Dara,</HI> to proceed to all tho&s;e extremities; that, for the re&s;t, he rejoyced ex|tremely to hear, that he began to find him&s;elf better, and that he was come thither for no other end than to receive his Commands. <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was not wanting to ex|pre&s;s to the Eunuch much &s;atisfaction, as to the proceedings of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to receive the Submi&s;&s;ions of this Son with all po&s;&s;ible appearances of joy; though he &s;aw very well, that matters had been carried too far, and &s;ufficiently knew the re&s;erved and crafty humour of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and his &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion for Reigning; and that there|fore he was not much to be tru&s;ted, for all his fair words. And yet notwith&s;tanding he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be circumvented, and in&s;tead of playing the &s;ure&s;t Chart, <HI>by</HI> u&s;ing his utmo&s;t power, <HI>by</HI> &s;tirring, <HI>by</HI> appearing, <HI>by</HI> cau&s;ing him&s;elf to be carried through the Town, and <HI>by</HI> a&s;&s;embling all his <HI>Omrahs,</HI> (for it was yet time to do all this) he goes about to outwit <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> him that was his Crafts-Ma&s;ter, and attempts to draw him into a &s;nare, wherein he will be found taken him&s;elf. He then &s;ends al&s;o an Eunuch to this Son, to let him know, that he well under&s;tood the ill conduct, and even the incapacity of <HI>Dara;</HI> that he could not but call to mind the particular inclina|tion he always had and expre&s;&s;ed towards him, that he could not doubt of his affection; and la&s;tly, that he &s;hould come to &s;ee him, and to advi&s;e with him what was fit to be done in the&s;e di&s;orders; and that he pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;hed to embrace him.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> on his &s;ide, &s;aw al&s;o well enough, that he was not to tru&s;t too much to the words of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> knowing e&s;pecially, that <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> his Enemy as well as Si&s;ter, was night and day about him, and that 'twas very probable, he acted nothing but by her motion. And he apprehended, that if he &s;hould come into the Fortre&s;s, he might be &s;eized on, and ill-treated; as it was &s;aid, that the re&s;olution was indeed taken to do &s;o, and &s;everal of tho&s;e lu&s;ty <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women, which &s;erve in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> were armed to &s;et upon him as &s;oon as he &s;hould enter. Whatever it be, he would never hazard him&s;elf, and yet &s;pread a rumour abroad, that the next day he would go to &s;ee his Father <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> But when the day was come, he put it off till another, and &s;o he delayed it from day to day, without ever making the Vi&s;it. In the mean time he continued his &s;ecret Negotiations and Cabals, and &s;ounded the mind of all the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o far, that at la&s;t, after he had well and clo&s;ely laid his De&s;ign, and politickly di&s;po&s;ed all things for the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, all were amazed to &s;ee, that one day, when he had &s;ent <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> his elde&s;t Son, to the Fortre&s;s, under a pretence of &s;eeing <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> in his name; this young Prince, bold and undertaking, falls pre&s;ently on the Guards that were at the Gate, and vigorou&s;ly driveth all before him, whil&s;t a great number of Men appointed, who were there all ready, did enter with fury, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Walls.</P>
<P>If ever a man was a&s;toni&s;hed, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was, &s;eeing that he was fallen into the &s;nare which he had prepared for others, that him&s;elf was impri&s;oned and <HI>Aurenge-Zebe</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Fortre&s;s. 'Tis &s;aid, that he pre&s;ently &s;ent to &s;ound the mind of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> promi&s;ing him upon his Crown and upon the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that if he would be faithful to him, and &s;erve him in this conjuncture, he would make him King; that he &s;hould come pre&s;ently to &s;ee him within, and not lo&s;e this occa&s;ion: Be&s;ides, that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, and an im|mortal Glory; in regard it would be &s;aid for ever, that <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had delivered <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Grandfather out of Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>And certainly, if <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had been re&s;olute enough to give this &s;troke, and <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> could have come abroad to &s;hew him&s;elf to the Town, and to take the Field,
<PB N="21" REF="345">
no man doubts, but all his great <HI>Omrahs</HI> would have followed him; nor would <HI>Au|reng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf have had the boldne&s;s nor the &s;avagene&s;s to fight again&s;t his own Father in Per&s;on, e&s;pecially &s;ince he mu&s;t have apprehended, that all the world would have abandon'd him, and po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> him&s;elf. And 'tis indeed the great fault which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> is ob&s;erved to have committed after the Battel, and the flight of <HI>Dara,</HI> not to have come out of the Fortre&s;s. But yet I have conver&s;ed with many, who maintained that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did prudently in it. For this hath been a que&s;tion much agitated among the Politicians, and there are no rea&s;ons wanting to countenance the Sentiment of the latter &s;ort; who al&s;o add, that Men almo&s;t always judge of things by the Event; that often very fooli&s;h Enterpri&s;es have been ob&s;er|ved to &s;ucceed, and which therefore are approved by all; that if <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had pro&s;pered in his de&s;ign, he would have been e&s;teemed the mo&s;t prudent and the mo&s;t able Man in the World; but now being taken, he was nothing but a good old Man, that &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be led by a Woman, his Daughter <HI>Begum,</HI> which was blind|ed by her pa&s;&s;ion, and had the vanity to believe, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would come to &s;ee her, that the Bird of it &s;elf would fly into the Cage, or at lea&s;t, that he would never be &s;o bold as to attempt the &s;ei&s;ure of the Fortre&s;s, nor have the power to do &s;o. The&s;e &s;ame Rea&s;oners maintaining al&s;o &s;tifly, that the greate&s;t fault that <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly commit, was, that he knew not how to take the occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the Crown, by the rare&s;t and the mo&s;t generous Action that ever was, to put his Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do him&s;elf Right and Ju&s;tice, as the So|veraign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things now &s;tand, he mu&s;t one day go and dye in <HI>Goualeor.</HI> But <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> (whether it was that he feared his Grandfa|ther would not keep his word with him, or that he &s;hould be him&s;elf detained with|in, or that he dur&s;t not play tricks with his Father <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> would never hearken to any thing, nor enter into the Apartment of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> an&s;wering very clo&s;ely, that he had no order from his Father to go and &s;ee him, but that he was by him com|manded not to return, without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortre&s;s, that &s;o he might come with all &s;afety to ki&s;s the Feet of his Maje&s;ty. There pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t two whole days before he could re&s;olve to &s;urrender the Keys; during which time, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> &s;taid there, unalterable in his re&s;olutions, keeping him&s;elf up|on his Guard night and day, with all his Troops about him; till at length <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;eeing that all his people that were upon the Guard at the little Gate, little by little disbanded, and that there was no more &s;afety on his &s;ide, gave him the Keys, with an order to tell <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he &s;hould come pre&s;ently if he were wi&s;e, and that he had mo&s;t important things to di&s;cour&s;e with him about. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was too cunning to commit &s;o gro&s;s a fault: On the contrary, he made his Eunuch <HI>Etbarkan</HI> Governor of the Fortre&s;s, who pre&s;ently &s;hut up <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> together with <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> and all his Women; cau&s;ing divers Gates to be walled up, that &s;o he might not be able to write or &s;peak to any body, nor go forth out of his Apartment without permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the mean time writ to him a little Note, which he &s;hewed to every body before he &s;ealed it; in which, among other things, he told him with dry expre&s;|&s;ions, that he knew from good hands, that notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e great prote&s;tations of e&s;teem and affection he made to him, and of contempt he made of <HI>Dara,</HI> he had, for all that, &s;ent to <HI>Dara</HI> two Elephants charged with Rupies of Gold, to rai&s;e him again, and to re-commence the War; and that therefore, in truth, it was not he that impri&s;oned him, but <HI>Dara,</HI> and that he might thank him for it, as the cau&s;e of all the&s;e misfortunes; and if it had not been for him, he would have come the very fir&s;t day to him, and paid him all the mo&s;t dutiful re&s;pects he could have looked for from a good Son: That, for the re&s;t, he begged his pardon, and a little patience; as &s;oon as he &s;hould have di&s;enabled <HI>Dara</HI> from executing his evil de&s;igns, he would come him|&s;elf and open the Gates to him.</P>
<P>I have heard it &s;aid concerning this Note, that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> in very deed, the &s;ame night that <HI>Dara</HI> departed, had &s;ent to him the&s;e Elephants laden with Rupies of Gold, and that it was <HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> that found a way to di&s;cover it to <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> as &s;he al&s;o had detected to him that Plot, which was laid again&s;t him with tho&s;e <HI>Tarta|rian</HI> Women; and that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf had intercepted &s;ome Letters of <HI>Chah-Je|han</HI> to <HI>Dara&punc;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="346">
I have conver&s;ed with others, that maintain there is no &s;uch thing, and that this Writing, which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hewed to all, was only to ca&s;t Sand into the Eyes of the People, and to labour, in &s;ome degree, to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf in &s;o &s;trange an action, and to devolve the Cau&s;e of it upon <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> and <HI>Dara,</HI> as if he had been forced to &s;uch proceedings. They are things, which are difficult enough well to di&s;cover. However it be, as &s;oon as <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was &s;hut up, almo&s;t all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> were in a manner nece&s;&s;itated to go and make their Court to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche;</HI> and (which is almo&s;t incredible) there was not one that had the Courage to &s;tir, or to attempt the lea&s;t in the behalf of his King, and for him that had made them what they were, and rai&s;ed them from the du&s;t, and perhaps from &s;lavery it &s;elf (which is ordinary enough in that Court) to advance them to Riches and Honour. Yet &s;ome few there are, as <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> and &s;ome others, that took no &s;ide; but all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t declared for <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis notwith&s;tanding to be noted what I &s;aid, that they were nece&s;&s;itated to do what they did. For 'tis not in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as in <HI>France,</HI> or other States of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> where the Grandees and Nobles have large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Land, and great Revenues, which enables them for a while to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of them&s;elves. <HI>There</HI> they have nothing but Pen&s;ions (as I have already touched above) which the King can take away from them at all hours, and thus ruin them in an in&s;tant; &s;o that they &s;hall be con&s;idered no more than if they never had been, nor have any credit to borrow a farthing.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> therefore having thus a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> took what Sums of Money he thought fit out of the Trea&s;ury; and then ha|ving left <HI>Chah-he&s;t-Kan,</HI> his Uncle, Governor of the Town, he went away with <HI>Mo|rad-Bakche</HI> to pur&s;ue <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>The day that the Army was to march out of <HI>Agra</HI> the particular Friends of <HI>Morad-Bak|che,</HI> e&s;pecially his Eunuch <HI>Chah-Abas,</HI> who knew, that the exce&s;s of civility and re&s;pect is ordinarily a &s;ign of impo&s;ture, coun&s;elled him, that &s;ince he was King, and every bo|dy treated him with the Title of Maje&s;ty, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf acknowledged him for &s;uch, he &s;hould let him go to pur&s;ue <HI>Dara,</HI> and &s;tay him&s;elf with his Troops about <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli.</HI> If he had followed this coun&s;el, 'tis certain, that he would have em|bara&s;&s;ed <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> not a little; but 'twas fatal, that he &s;hould neglect &s;o good advice: <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is too fortunate; <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> entirely confideth in his promi&s;es, and in the Oaths of Fidelity they had &s;worn to one another upon the Alcoran. They went away together, and went with the &s;ame pace towards <HI>Dehli.</HI></P>
<P>When they were come to <HI>Maturas,</HI> three or four &s;mall days Journey from <HI>Agra,</HI> the friends of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> who perceived &s;omething, endeavoured again to per&s;wade him, that he &s;hould beware; a&s;&s;uring him that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had evil de&s;igns, and that beyond all doubt &s;ome mi&s;chief was upon the Anvil; that they had notice of it from all parts, and that by no means, for that day at lea&s;t, he &s;hould go to &s;ee him; that it would be much better to prevent this &s;troke the &s;oone&s;t it might be; that he was only to forbear going to vi&s;it him that day, excu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome Indi&s;po&s;ition. But what&s;oever could be &s;aid to him he believed nothing of it, his Ears were &s;topped to all the good advice that was given him, and as if he had been enchanted by the friend|&s;hip of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> he could not hold to go to him that very night, and to &s;tay at Supper with him. As &s;oon as he was come, <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who expected him, and had al|ready prepared all things with <HI>Mirkan,</HI> and three or four of his mo&s;t intimate Cap|tains, was not wanting in embracements, and in redoubling his Court&s;hip, Civilities and Submi&s;&s;ions, in&s;omuch as gently to pa&s;s his hankerchief over his face, and to wipe off his &s;weat and du&s;t, treating him &s;till with the title of King and Maje&s;ty. In the mean time the Table is &s;erved, they &s;up, the conver&s;ation grows warm, they di&s;cour&s;e of various things as they u&s;e to do; and at la&s;t there is brought a huge Bottle of ex|cellent <HI>Chiras</HI> Wine, and &s;ome other Bottles of <HI>Caboul</HI> Wine, for a Debauch. Then <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as a grave &s;erious Man, and one that would appear a great Mahumetan, and very regular, ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bly ri&s;eth from Table, and having with much kindne&s;s invited <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> who loved a Gla&s;s of Wine very well, and who reli&s;hed the Wine that was &s;erved, &s;crupled not to drink of it to exce&s;s. In a word, he made him&s;elf drunk, and fell a&s;leep. This was the thing that was wi&s;hed; for pre&s;ently &s;ome Ser|vants of his that were there, were commanded away, under a pretence, to let him &s;leep without making any noi&s;e; and then his Zable and Ponyard were taken from

about him: But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not long, but came him&s;elf and wakened him. He entred into the Chamber, and roughly hit him with his foot, and when he began to open a little his Eyes, he made to him this &s;hort and &s;urpri&s;ing Reprimand: What means this, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> What &s;hame and what ignominy is this, that &s;uch a King as you are, &s;hould have &s;o little temper, as thus to make him&s;elf drunk? What will be &s;aid both of you and me? Take this infamous Man, this Drunkard, tye him hand and foot, and throw him into that room to &s;leep out his Wine. No &s;ooner &s;aid, but it was executed; notwith&s;tanding all his appeal and out-cry, five or &s;ix per&s;ons fall up|on him, and fetter his hands and feet. The things could not be done, but &s;ome of his Men that were thereabout had news of it. They made &s;ome noi&s;e, and would enter forcibly; but <HI>Allah-Couly,</HI> one of his chief Officers, and the Ma&s;ter of his Ar|tillery, that had been gained long before, threatned them, and made them draw back. Without any delay, Men were &s;ent through the whole Army to calm this fir&s;t Commotion, which al&s;o might have proved dangerous; they made them believe it was nothing, they having been pre&s;ent, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was only drunk, that in that condition he had railed at every body, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf, in&s;omuch that there had been a nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eeing him drunk and furious, to keep him apart; that the next day they would &s;ee him abroad, after he had dige&s;ted his Wine. In the mean time, the Pre&s;ents walked about all night among&s;t the chief Officers of the Army, their Pay was forthwith encrea&s;ed, they had great Promi&s;es made them; and as there was none, that had not long &s;ince apprehended &s;ome &s;uch thing, there was no great won|der to &s;ee almo&s;t all things quieted the next morning; &s;o that the very next night this poor Prince was &s;hut up in a little clo&s;e hou&s;e, &s;uch an one as is wont to be placed on Elephants to carry Women, and he was carried directly to <HI>Dehli</HI> into <HI>Slimager,</HI> which is a little old Fortre&s;s in the mid&s;t of the River.</P>
<P>After that all was thus appea&s;ed, except the Eunuch <HI>Chah-Abas,</HI> who cau&s;ed diffi|culty enough, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> received the whole Army of <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> into his Service, and went after <HI>Dara,</HI> who marched apace towards <HI>Lahor,</HI> with an intention well to fortifie him&s;elf in that place, and thither to draw his Friends. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> fol|lowed him with &s;o much &s;peed, that he had not time to do any great matter, finding him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to retreat, and to take the way of <HI>Multan,</HI> where al&s;o he could do nothing con&s;iderable, becau&s;e that <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the great heat, marched night and day; in&s;omuch, that to encourage all to make ha&s;te, he &s;ometimes advanced almo&s;t all alone two or three Leagues before the whole Army, finding him|&s;elf often obliged to drink ill water like others, to be content with a cru&s;t of dry bread, and to &s;leep under a Tree, &s;taying for his Army in the mid&s;t of the high-way, laying his head on his Shield like a common Souldier. So that <HI>Dara</HI> found him&s;elf con&s;train|ed to abandon <HI>Multan</HI> al&s;o, that he might avoid being near <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> whom he was not able to encounter. Here 'tis that the State&s;men of this Countrey have rea|&s;oned very diver&s;ly: For 'tis &s;aid, that if <HI>Dara,</HI> when he went out of <HI>Lahor,</HI> had ca&s;t him|&s;elf into the Kingdom of <HI>Caboul,</HI> as he was advi&s;ed, he would there have found above ten thou&s;and warlick Men, de&s;igned again&s;t the <HI>Augans,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and the <HI>&V;sbecs,</HI> and for a Guard to that Countrey, the Governor whereof was <HI>Mohabet-Kan,</HI> one of the mo&s;t potent and the mo&s;t ancient of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and that had never been <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Friend; that, be&s;ides, he would have been there at the Gate of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>&V;sbec;</HI> that he was likely, that there being no want of Money, all that <HI>Militia</HI> and <HI>Mohabet-Kan</HI> him&s;elf, would have embraced his Party; and that further, he might have drawn a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not only from <HI>&V;sbec,</HI> but al&s;o from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as well as from <HI>Hou|mayon,</HI> whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had re&s;tored to his Country again&s;t <HI>Zaber-Kan,</HI> King of the <HI>Patans,</HI> who had driven him thence. But <HI>Dara</HI> was too unfortunate to follow &s;o good advice. In&s;tead of that he went towards <HI>Scimdy,</HI> to ca&s;t him&s;elf into the For|tre&s;s of <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> that &s;trong and famous place, &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the River <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;eeing him take this way, found it not fit to follow him further off, being extremely glad that he had not taken the way to <HI>Caboul.</HI> He contented him|&s;elf to &s;end after him &s;even or eight thou&s;and Men, under the Conduct of <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> his Fo&s;ter-brother, and turned back with the &s;ame expedition to the place whence he was come, much apprehending le&s;t any thing &s;hould fall out about <HI>Agra;</HI> le&s;t &s;ome or other of tho&s;e potent <HI>Rajah</HI>'s as <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> or <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> &s;hould make an attempt

<P>When he thus returned from <HI>Multan</HI> towards <HI>Lahor,</HI> and marched his ordinary &s;wift pace, he &s;aw the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> come again&s;t him, accompanied with four or five thou&s;and of his <HI>Ragipous,</HI> in a very good equipage; <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who had left his Army behind, and who al&s;o knew that this <HI>Raja</HI> was very affectionate to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> was &s;ufficiently &s;urpri&s;ed, as may ea&s;ily be imagined, fearing left this <HI>Raja</HI> &s;hould make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion, and do a Ma&s;ter-piece of State, by &s;ei&s;ing on him, to draw <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> out of Pri&s;on, which at that time was very ea&s;ie to do. Neither is it known, whether this <HI>Raja</HI> had not &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign; for he had marched with ex|traordinary &s;peed, in&s;omuch that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had no news of it, believing him yet to be at <HI>Dehli.</HI> But what may not re&s;olution and pre&s;ence of mind do? <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> without any alteration of his Countenance, marched directly towards the <HI>Raja,</HI> and as far off as he could &s;ee him, maketh &s;igns to him with his hands, importing that he &s;hould make ha&s;t to a nearer approach, crying out to him with a loud voice, <HI>Sala|med Bached Rajagi, Salamed Bached Babagi,</HI> treating him with the Titles of <HI>Lord Raja,</HI> and <HI>Lord Father.</HI> When the <HI>Raja</HI> was come to him; I expected you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> with great impatience; the work is done, <HI>Dara</HI> is lo&s;t, he is all alone; I have &s;ent <HI>Mir-baba</HI> after him, from whom he cannot e&s;cape: And for an exce&s;s of kindne&s;s to him, he took off his Neck-lace of Pearls, and put it about the Neck of this <HI>Raja:</HI> And the &s;ooner to rid him&s;elf hand&s;omely of him, (for he wi&s;hed him far enough) Go, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> with all the expedition you can to <HI>Lahor,</HI> my Army is &s;omewhat tyred; go quick|ly to attend me there; I apprehend that el&s;e &s;omething &s;ini&s;ter might fall out there; I make you Governor of that place, and put all things into your hands. For the re&s;t, I am exceedingly obliged to you for what you have done with <HI>Soliman Chekouh:</HI> Where have you left <HI>Delil-Kan?</HI> I &s;hall find my revenge of him. Make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, <HI>Salamed Bached,</HI> Farewell.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> being arrived at <HI>Tata-baker,</HI> made Governor of that place a very under&s;tand|ing, gallant, and generous Eunuch, with a very good Garri&s;on of <HI>Patans</HI> and <HI>Sayeds;</HI> and for Cannoneers, a good number of <HI>Franguis, Portugals, Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Ger|mans,</HI> who had followed him out of great hopes he had given them, (for, if his Af|fairs had pro&s;pered and he were become King, we mu&s;t all have re&s;olved to be <HI>Omrahs,</HI> as many <HI>Franguis</HI> as we were.) He there left al&s;o the greate&s;t part of his Trea&s;ure; he wanted as yet no Gold nor Silver; and &s;taying there but a very few days, he marched away with two or three thou&s;and Men only, de&s;cending along the River <HI>Indus</HI> towards <HI>Scindy,</HI> and from thence cro&s;&s;ing with an incredible celerity all tho&s;e Territories of the <HI>Raja Katche,</HI> he arrived in <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> and came to the Gates of <HI>Amadevat.</HI> The Father-in-law of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> called <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan,</HI> was Governor there, with a very good Garri&s;on, able to re&s;i&s;t. Yet notwith&s;tanding, whether it was that he was &s;urpri&s;ed, or that he wanted courage (for although he was of tho&s;e ancient Princes of <HI>Machate,</HI> yet he was no great Souldier, though a Man of a very obliging and civil conver&s;ation) he did not oppo&s;e <HI>Dara,</HI> but rather received him very honourably, and even managed him afterwards with &s;o much dexterity, that <HI>Dara</HI> was &s;o &s;imple as to tru&s;t him&s;elf with him, and to communicate to him his De&s;igns; in&s;omuch as that he &s;hewed him the Letters which he received from the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> and of many other of his Friends, which prepared them&s;elves to come to him; although it proved too true, what every body told him, and his Friends confirmed by Letters, that certainly this <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan</HI> would betray him.</P>
<P>Never was any man more &s;urprized than <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> when he heard that <HI>Dara</HI> was in <HI>Amadevat:</HI> For he well knew, that he wanted no Money, and that all his Friends, and all the di&s;contented Party, which was numerous, would not fail to betake them|&s;elves by little and little to him: And on the other &s;ide, he found it not &s;afe to go and find him out him&s;elf in that place, by removing him&s;elf &s;o far from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> to go and embara&s;e him&s;elf in all tho&s;e Countries of the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s, <HI>Je&s;seigne, Je&s;|&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> and others, that are in tho&s;e Provinces. Be&s;ides, he apprehended, le&s;t <HI>Sul|tan Sujah</HI> &s;hould advance with a &s;trong Army, which was already about <HI>Elabas,</HI> and le&s;t the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Serenaguer</HI> &s;hould de&s;cend from the Hills with <HI>Soliman Chekouh:</HI> So that
<PB N="25" REF="347">
he was &s;ufficiently perplexed and troubled, not knowing which way to turn. At la&s;t he believed it be&s;t to leave <HI>Dara</HI> for a time quiet where he was, and to go thither where his pre&s;ence and Army was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, which was towards <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> who had already pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Ganges</HI> at <HI>Elabas.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was come to encamp in a little Village called <HI>Cadjoue,</HI> and had conveniently &s;eized him&s;elf of a great <HI>Talab,</HI> or Re&s;ervatory of Water, which is there in the way; and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> came to place him&s;elf on the &s;ide of a &s;mall Torrent, at the di&s;tance of a mile and an half from thence, on <HI>Agra</HI>'s &s;ide. Between both was a very fair Campagne, very proper for a Battel. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was no &s;ooner arrived, but be|ing impatient to end this War, at break of day he went to face <HI>Sujah,</HI> leaving his Baggage on the other &s;ide of the Torrent. He fell upon <HI>Sujah</HI> with an effort unima|ginable. <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> Pri&s;oner of <HI>Decan,</HI> and who arrived ju&s;t on the day of the Combat, fearing <HI>Dara</HI> no more, becau&s;e his Family was more in &s;afety, did there al&s;o lay out all his force, courage, and dexterity. But &s;eeing that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had well fortified him&s;elf, and was accompanied with a very good Artillery, advantageou&s;ly placed, it was not po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> to force him, nor to make him retreat from thence, &s;o as to make him lo&s;e tho&s;e Waters. On the contrary, he was obliged him|&s;elf to draw back &s;everal times, &s;o vigorou&s;ly was he repul&s;ed, in&s;omuch that he found him&s;elf in great perplexity. <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> not being willing to advance too far into the Campagne, nor to remove from that advantagious place where he was, pretending only to defend him&s;elf; which was very prudently done. For he fore&s;aw, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could not &s;tay there long, and that in that hot &s;ea&s;on he would be ab&s;olutely obli|ged to turn back towards the Torrent for the Water; and that, when he &s;hould do &s;o he would fall upon his Rear, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> al&s;o fore&s;aw well enough the &s;ame thing, and that was the rea&s;on why he was &s;o forward and pre&s;&s;ing; but behold another more trouble&s;ome accident.</P>
<P>In this very time he receiveth intelligence, that the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> who in <HI>ap|pearance</HI> had accommodated him&s;elf with him, was fallen upon his Rear, and plun|dred his Baggage and Trea&s;ure. This News a&s;toni&s;hed him much, and the more, be|cau&s;e he perceived that his Army which had heard of it was thereby frighted, and fal|len into di&s;order. Yet he lo&s;es not his judgment for all this; and being well aware, that to turn back was to hazard all, he re&s;olved, as in the Battle of <HI>Dara,</HI> to bear up the be&s;t he could, and to expect with a &s;teady foot all Events. In the mean time, the di&s;order grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e in his Army: <HI>Sujah,</HI> who was re&s;olved to profit of the occa&s;ion, taketh his time, and pre&s;&s;eth him vigorou&s;ly. He that led <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Elephant is killed with the &s;hot of an Arrow; he leads the Bea&s;t as well as he can him&s;elf, till another could be had in that Leaders place. Arrows rain upon him; he returns many him&s;elf, his Elephant begins to be frighted, and to go back. Behold him now in great extremity, and brought to that point, that one foot of his was out of the &s;eat, as if he meant to ca&s;t him&s;elf to the ground; and no man knows what in that trouble he had not done, if <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> being nigh, and performing like a great Man as he was, beyond imagination, called to him, in holding up his hand <HI>Decan-kou, Decan-kou,</HI> where is <HI>Decan?</HI> This &s;eems to have been the greate&s;t extremi|ty, to which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could be reduced. One would have &s;aid, 'twas now and here that Fortune had abandon'd him, and there is almo&s;t no appearance of a po&s;&s;ibi|lity to e&s;cape. But his good Fortune is &s;tronger than all that: <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> mu&s;t be routed, and take &s;light, like <HI>Dara,</HI> to &s;ave his life: <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> mu&s;t remain Victori|ous, carry away the Bell, and be King of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>We are to remember the Battle of <HI>Samenguer,</HI> and that, in appearance, &s;light ac|cident which ruined <HI>Dara:</HI> 'Tis the &s;ame over-&s;ight, or rather the &s;ame Trea&s;on, which is now de&s;troying <HI>Sultan Sujah.</HI> One of his chief Captains, <HI>Allah-verdi-Kan,</HI> who (as &s;ome &s;ay) had been gained, u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th the &s;ame Artifice that <HI>Calil-ullah-Kan</HI> had employed towards <HI>Dara;</HI> though there were &s;ome who believed, that there was no malice in the ca&s;e, and that it was a meer piece of Flattery. For &s;eeing that the whole Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was in di&s;order, he ran towards <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> telling him the &s;ame thing, that <HI>Calil-ullah Kan</HI> did to <HI>Dara,</HI> and begging of him with fol|ded hands, that he would &s;tay no longer in &s;o great danger upon his Elephant. Come down, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> in the name of God, mount on Hor&s;e-back, God hath made you So|vereign of the <HI>Indies,</HI> let us pur&s;ue tho&s;e Fugitives, let not <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> e&s;cape us.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="348">
But not to &s;tay long from declaring the &s;trange Fortune of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and the in|credible conjuncture that recovers his de&s;perate condition; <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> not more con|&s;iderate than <HI>Dara,</HI> commits the &s;ame Fault; and he was no &s;ooner come down from his Elephant, but his Army &s;eeing him no more, was &s;truck with a terror, believing there was Trea&s;on, and that he was either taken or &s;lain. Whereupon they disbanded, with|out any more ado, as <HI>Dara</HI>'s Army did in the Battel of <HI>Samonguer;</HI> and the Defeat was &s;o great, that the <HI>Sultan</HI> was fortunate in that he could &s;ave him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> hearing this unexpected News, and perceiving it was not very &s;afe for him to tarry there, contented him&s;elf with the Spoil he had got, and with all diligence marched &s;treight to <HI>Agra,</HI> thence to pa&s;s to his Countrey. The noi&s;e was already in <HI>Agra,</HI> that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had lo&s;t the Battel; that he was taken, together with <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and that <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> brought them both Pri&s;oners. In&s;omuch, that <HI>Chah|he&s;t-Kan,</HI> who was Governor of the Town, and Uncle to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> &s;eeing <HI>Je&s;&s;om|&s;eigne,</HI> who&s;e Treachery he had heard of, at the Gates, and de&s;pairing of his Life, had taken into his hand a Cup of Poy&s;on to make him&s;elf away, and had, as they &s;ay, in very deed &s;wallowed it, if his Women had not fallen upon him, and hindred him: So that 'tis thought, if <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> had had the wit and courage to &s;tay longer in <HI>Agra,</HI> if he had threatned boldly, and promi&s;ed and acted vigorou&s;ly for the freedom of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> he might have drawn him out of Pri&s;on; &s;o much the more ea&s;ily, be|cau&s;e all <HI>Agra</HI> was for two whole days in that belief, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was overcome. But <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> who knew how all things went, and who dur&s;t not long &s;tay there, nor attempt any thing, did nothing but pa&s;s, returning with all &s;peed homewards.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who apprehended mi&s;chief from <HI>Agra,</HI> and fear'd le&s;t <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> &s;hould undertake &s;omething for <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> was not long in the pur&s;uit after <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> he turn'd &s;hort for <HI>Agra</HI> with his whole Army, where he &s;tay'd a good while, giving order for all things. Mean time he received intelligence, that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had not lo&s;t many Men in his being routed, for want of farther pur&s;uit; that al&s;o from the Lands of the <HI>Raja's,</HI> which are in tho&s;e quarters, on the right and left of <HI>Ganges,</HI> he rai&s;ed great Forces, upon the &s;core of the reputation he had of being very rich, and very liberal, and that he fortified him&s;elf in <HI>Elabas,</HI> that important and famous Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ganges,</HI> which, with its Fortre&s;s, is the fir&s;t In-let into <HI>Bengale.</HI> And then he con|&s;idered al&s;o, that he had about him two Per&s;ons, which indeed were very capable to &s;erve him, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> his elde&s;t Son, and <HI>Emir-Jemla;</HI> but he well knew, that tho&s;e who have done good &s;ervice to their Prince, grow often in&s;olent, in the belief, that all is due to them, and that they cannot be recompenced enough. He perceived already, that the former of them began very much to emancipate him&s;elf, and that every day he became more arrogant, for having &s;eized on the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra,</HI> and by that means had broken all the De&s;igns which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> could have formed. And as to the <HI>latter,</HI> he knew indeed the force of his Under&s;tanding, his Conduct, and Va|lour; but that was the very thing which made him apprehend him the more: For knowing that he was very rich, that his Reputation was great, that he pa&s;&s;ed for the <HI>Fir&s;t Mover</HI> in Affairs, and for the able&s;t Man in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> he doubted not, but that after the Example of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> he entertain'd him&s;elf with big hopes. All this certainly would have been able to perplex an ordinary Spirit, but <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> found a Remedy to all. He knew to remove them both with &s;o much prudence, and even with &s;o much hand&s;omne&s;s, that neither of them found any cau&s;e to complain of it. He &s;ent them both again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> with a pui&s;&s;ant Army, letting <HI>Emir</HI> &s;ecret|ly know, that the Government of <HI>Bengale,</HI> which is the be&s;t quarter of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> was de&s;ign'd for him, to hold it during his life, and for his Son after his decea&s;e; and that thereby he would begin to expre&s;s to him his acknowledgments for the great Services he had done him; and that therefore it belonged only to him to defeat <HI>Sujah,</HI> and that as &s;oon as he &s;hould have compa&s;&s;ed it, he would make him <HI>Mir-ul Omrabs,</HI> which is the fir&s;t and the mo&s;t honourable place of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and no le&s;s than the Prince of the <HI>Omrahs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To</HI> Sultan Mahmoud <HI>his Son, he &s;aid only the&s;e few words:</HI> Remember that thou art the Elde&s;t of my Children, that 'tis for thy &s;elf thou goe&s;t forth to fight; that thou ha&s;t done much, but yet nothing, if thou overcome&s;t not <HI>Sujah,</HI> who is our greate&s;t and powerfulle&s;t Ene|my; I hope, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, to be &s;oon Ma&s;ter of the re&s;t.</P>

rich Ve&s;ts, &s;ome Hor&s;es and Elephants gallantly harne&s;&s;ed; making in the mean time <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> to con&s;ent, that his only Son, <HI>Mabmet Emir-Kan,</HI> &s;hould &s;tay with him for a good Education, or rather for a Pledge of his Fidelity; and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> that his Wife &s;hould remain in <HI>Agra</HI> (which was the Daughter of the above-mention'd King of <HI>Golkonda)</HI> as too trouble&s;om a thing in an Army, and in &s;uch an Expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who was always in the apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t the <HI>Raja's</HI> of the lower <HI>Bengale,</HI> which he had ill treated, &s;hould be rai&s;ed again&s;t him, and who feared nothing more than to have to do with <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> had no &s;ooner received this News, but ap|prehending that the pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Bengale</HI> would be ob&s;tructed, and that <HI>Emir</HI> would pa&s;s in &s;ome other place the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> either lower or higher than <HI>Elabas,</HI> rai&s;ed his Camp, and went down to <HI>Benares</HI> and <HI>Patna,</HI> whence he betook him&s;elf to <HI>Mogiere,</HI> a &s;mall Town &s;eated upon the <HI>Ganges,</HI> a place commonly call'd the <HI>Key</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> being a kind of Streight between the Mountains and the Woods, which are not far from thence. He thought fit to &s;tay in that place, and there to fortifie him&s;elf; and for greater &s;afety, he cau&s;ed a great Trench to be made, which I have &s;een, pa&s;&s;ing that way &s;ome years after, from the Town and River unto the Mountain, being well re&s;olved there to attend <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and to di&s;pute that pa&s;&s;age with him. But he was &s;ufficiently a&s;toni&s;h'd, when he was told, that the Troops of <HI>Emir,</HI> which &s;lowly de&s;cended along the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> were certainly for nothing but to amu&s;e him; that him&s;elf was not there; that he had gained the <HI>Raja's</HI> of tho&s;e Mountains, which are on the right hand of the River; and that he and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> marched apace over their Lands with all the Flower of the Army, drawing &s;traight to <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> to in|tercept him: So that he was con&s;trained to quit, as &s;oon as he could, his Fortifications; yet notwith&s;tanding he made &s;o much ha&s;te, that though he was obliged to follow tho&s;e windings, which the River <HI>Ganges</HI> on that &s;ide maketh towards the left hand, he prevented <HI>Emir</HI> by &s;ome days, and arrived fir&s;t at <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> where he had time to fortifie him&s;elf; becau&s;e <HI>Emir</HI> having heard this News, took his March to the left hand towards <HI>Ganges,</HI> through very ill ways, there to expect his Troops, which came down with the Body of the Artillery and the Baggage along the River. As &s;oon as all was come, he went to attaque <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who defended him&s;elf very well for five or &s;ix days; but &s;eeing that the Artillery of <HI>Emir,</HI> which played ince&s;&s;antly, ruined all his Fortifications, which were made but of &s;andy Earth and Fagots, and that he could not but with much difficulty make re&s;i&s;tance in that place, be&s;ides that the Sea&s;on of the Rain began, he retired him&s;elf, at the favour of the Night, leaving behind two great Peeces of Cannon. <HI>Emir</HI> dur&s;t not follow him in the night, for fear of &s;ome Ambu&s;h, putting off the pur&s;uit 'till the next morning: But <HI>Sujah</HI> had the good luck, that at the break of day there began to fall a Rain, which la&s;ted above three days; &s;o that <HI>Emir</HI> could not only &s;tir out of <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> but &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to pa&s;s the Winter there, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Rains in that Countrey, which render the ways &s;o trouble&s;om for more than four Months, <HI>viz. July, Augu&s;t, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> that the Armies cannot po&s;&s;ibly march. And hereby <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had the means to retire him&s;elf, and to chu&s;e what place he would, having time enough to fortifie his Army, and to &s;end out of the inferiour <HI>Bengale</HI> for many Peeces of Cannon, and a good num|ber of <HI>Portugals,</HI> that were retired thither, becau&s;e of the great fertility of the Coun|trey: For he much courted all tho&s;e <HI>Portugal</HI> Fathers, Mi&s;&s;ionaries, that are in that Pro|vince, promi&s;ing them no le&s;s than that he would make them all rich, and build Chur|ches for them where&s;oever they would. And they were indeed capable to &s;erve him, it being certain, that in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale</HI> there are to be found no le&s;s than eight or nine Thou&s;and Families of <HI>Franguis, Portugals,</HI> and the&s;e either Natives or Me&s;ticks.</P>
<P>But <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who, for the rea&s;on above-mentioned, was grown fierce, and a&s;pired, perhaps, to greater things than at that time he ought, did pretend to command the Army ab&s;olutely, and that <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> &s;hould follow his Orders, letting al&s;o from time to time fall in&s;olent words in reference to his Father <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as if he were ob|liged to him for the Crown, and uttering Expre&s;&s;ions of Contempt and Threat again&s;t <HI>Emir Jemla;</HI> which cau&s;ed great coldne&s;s betwixt them two, which la&s;ted a pretty while, until <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> under&s;tood, that his Father was very much di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct: And apprehending, le&s;t <HI>Emir</HI> had order to &s;eize on his per&s;on, he went away to <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> accompanied with a very &s;mall number, and to him he
<PB N="28" REF="349">
made great promi&s;es, and &s;wore Fidelity. But <HI>Sujah,</HI> who feared <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI>'s &s;nares, could not tru&s;t him, having always an Eye upon his Actions, without giving him any con&s;iderable Command; which he &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted, that &s;ome months after, not knowing what would become of him, he left <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and re|turned to <HI>Emir,</HI> who received him well enough, a&s;&s;uring him, that he would write in his behalf to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and do his utmo&s;t to make him forget that fault.</P>
<P>I think fit here to take notice, on the by, of what many have told me, <HI>viz.</HI> That this E&s;cape of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> was altogether made by the Artifices of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who cared not much to hazard this Son of his to try to de&s;troy <HI>Sujah,</HI> and who was glad enough, that whatever the Event were, he might have a &s;pecious pretence to put him in a place of &s;urety. However it be, he afterwards &s;hew'd him&s;elf much di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with him, and wrote to him a &s;evere Letter, in which he enjoin'd him to return to <HI>Dehli,</HI> but giving order in the mean time, that he &s;hould not come &s;o far: For he no &s;ooner had pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> but he met with Troops that &s;topt him, and put him up in a &s;mall Chair, (as was done to <HI>Morad-Bakche)</HI> and carried him to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> whence 'tis thought he will never be &s;et at liberty: <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> by this means freeing him&s;elf from great perplexity; who then al&s;o let his &s;econd Son, <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> know, that the point of Reigning is &s;o delicate a thing, that Kings mu&s;t be jealous even of their own &s;hadow; adding, that if he be not di&s;creet, the like may befall him what had befallen his Brother, and that he ought to think <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not a Man, that would &s;uffer that to be done to him&s;elf, what <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did to his Father <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> and what he had al&s;o lately &s;een done to <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed we may on this occa&s;ion &s;ay, that if this Son continue to behave him|&s;elf as he hath done hitherto, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> will have no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect him, and to be di&s;&s;atisfied with him: For no Slave can be more tractable, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf never appear'd more carele&s;s of Greatne&s;s, nor more given to Devotion than he: Yet I have known Men of Parts, who believed, that he is not &s;o in good earne&s;t, but by &s;u|perlative policy and craft, like that of his Father, which we may have the proof of in time.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all the&s;e things were thus tran&s;acted in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> re&s;i&s;ted the be&s;t he could the Forces of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing now on one &s;ide of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> of a Channel, or &s;ome other River, (for that Countrey is full of them) then on the other; <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> kept him&s;elf about <HI>Agra,</HI> going to and fro; and at length, after he had al&s;o &s;ent <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> he came to <HI>Dehli,</HI> where in good ear|ne&s;t he took upon him publickly to act the King, giving order for all Affairs of the Kingdom, and e&s;pecially thinking on means to catch <HI>Dara,</HI> and to get him out of <HI>Gu|zaratte,</HI> which was a very hard thing, for the Rea&s;ons already mentioned. But the great good Fortune, and the &s;ingular dexterity of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;oon drew him thence, which now follows next to be related.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> who had retired him&s;elf to his Countrey, and made the be&s;t of what he had taken in the Battel of <HI>Kadjoue,</HI> rai&s;ed a &s;trong Army, and wrote to <HI>Dara,</HI> that he &s;hould come to <HI>Agra</HI> as &s;oon as he could, and that he would join with his Forces. <HI>Dara,</HI> who had by this time &s;et on foot a pretty numerous Army, (though it con&s;i&s;ted, for the mo&s;t part, but of gathered people) and who hoped, that approaching to <HI>A|gra,</HI> many of his old Friends, &s;eeing him with <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> would not fail to join with him al&s;o, immediately leaveth <HI>Amadevad,</HI> and marcheth with great &s;peed to <HI>A&s;mire,</HI> &s;even or eight days journey from <HI>Agra.</HI> But <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> kept not his word with him: The <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> interpo&s;ed to make his peace with <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to fa&s;ten him to his Party; or, at lea&s;t, to hinder his de&s;ign, which was capable to ruine him&s;elf, and to make all the <HI>Raja's</HI> ri&s;e; and wrote to him &s;everal Letters, giving him to under&s;tand the great danger he went to expo&s;e him&s;elf to, by e&s;pou&s;ing a Party in that Extremi|ty, as that of <HI>Dara's</HI> was; that he &s;hould well con&s;ider what he was going to do; that he went about wholly to de&s;troy him&s;elf, and all his whole Family; that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would never forgive him; that he was a <HI>Raja</HI> as him&s;elf; that he &s;hould think on &s;pa|ring the blood of the <HI>Ragipous;</HI> that if he thought to draw the <HI>Raja's</HI> to his Party, he would find tho&s;e that would hinder him from it. In a word, that it was a bu&s;ine&s;s which concern'd all the Gentry of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and expo&s;ed them to danger, if way were given to kindle a Fire, which would not be extingui&s;h'd at plea&s;ure. And la&s;tly, if he would leave <HI>Dara</HI> to him&s;elf, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would forget all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and pre|&s;ent
<PB N="29" REF="349">
him with all he had taken, and give him that very in&s;tant the Government of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> which would be very convenient for him, that Countrey being near his Lands; that he could be there in full liberty and &s;afety, and as long as he plea&s;ed, and that him&s;elf would be Caution for all. In a word, this <HI>Raja</HI> acted his part &s;o well, that he made <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> return to his Land, whil&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> approached with his whole Army to <HI>A&s;mire,</HI> and encamped in the &s;ight of that of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>And now what could this poor Prince <HI>Dara</HI> do? He &s;eeth him&s;elf abandoned, and fru&s;trated of his hopes. He con&s;iders, that to turn back &s;afe to <HI>Amadevad</HI> was impo&s;|&s;ible, in regard that it was a March of Thirty and five days; that it was in the heat of Summer; that water would fail him; that they were all the Lands of <HI>Raja's,</HI> Friends or Allies of <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> or <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne;</HI> that the Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> which was not hara&s;&s;ed like his, would not fail to follow him. <HI>'Tis as good,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>to peri&s;h here; and although the Match be altogether unequal, let us venture all, and give Bat|tel once more.</HI> But alas! what does he mean to do? He is not only abandoned by all, but he hath yet with him <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan,</HI> whom he tru&s;ts, and who betrays him, and di&s;covers all his De&s;igns to <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> 'Tis true, that <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan</HI> was puni&s;h'd for his Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and kill'd in the Battel; whether it was by the hands of <HI>Dara</HI> him&s;elf, as many told me, or (which is more probable) by &s;ome of <HI>Au|reng-Zebe</HI>'s Army, who being &s;ecret Parti&s;ans of <HI>Dara,</HI> found means to get to him, and to di&s;patch him, fearing le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;cover them, and have &s;ome knowledge of the Letters they had written to <HI>Dara.</HI> But what did it benefit him at that time, that <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan</HI> was dead? <HI>Dara</HI> &s;hould have &s;ooner follow'd the advice of his Friends, and never have confided in him.</P>
<P>The Fight began between Nine and Ten of the Clock in the morning: <HI>Dara</HI>'s Ar|tillery, which was very well placed on a little Eminency, was loud enough; but, as was &s;aid, mo&s;t of the Peeces without Bullets; &s;o was he betray'd by all! 'Tis needle&s;s to relate the other Particulars of this Battel; it was properly not a Battel, but a Rout. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that hardly the On&s;et was begun, but <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> was near and in &s;ight of <HI>Dara,</HI> to whom he &s;ent word, that he &s;hould flie pre&s;ently, unle&s;s he would be ta|ken. So that this poor Prince, being altogether &s;urpri&s;ed, was con&s;trained to run away in&s;tantly, and with &s;o much di&s;order and precipitation, that he had not lei&s;ure to put up his Baggage. It was no &s;mall matter, that he was able to get away with his Wife, and the re&s;t of his Family. And 'tis certain, that if the <HI>Raja-Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> would have done what he could, he could never have e&s;caped; but he always had a re&s;pect to the Royal Family; or rather, he was too crafty and politick, and had too great fore|ca&s;t, to venture to lay hands on a Prince of the Blood.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Prince, de&s;erted by almo&s;t all, and finding him&s;elf accompanied but of Two thou&s;and Men at mo&s;t, was forced in the hotte&s;t of Summer to cro&s;s, without Tents or Baggage, all tho&s;e Countries of the <HI>Raja's,</HI> that are almo&s;t from <HI>A&s;|mire</HI> to <HI>Amadevad.</HI> Mean time the <HI>Koullis,</HI> which are the Countrey People, and the wor&s;t of all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the greate&s;t Robbers, follow him night and day, rifle and kill his Soldiers, with &s;o much cruelty, that no Man could &s;tay Two hundred Paces be|hind the Body, but he was pre&s;ently &s;tripp'd naked, or butcher'd upon the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance. Yet notwith&s;tanding, <HI>Dara</HI> made &s;hift to get near <HI>Amadevad,</HI> when he hoped, that the next day, or &s;oon after, he &s;hould enter into the Town to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and to try once more to gather again &s;ome Forces: But all things fall out contrary to van|qui&s;hed and unfortunate Men.</P>
<P>The Governor, whom he had left in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amadevad,</HI> had already received both menacing and promi&s;ing Letters from <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> which made him lo&s;e Cou|rage, and incline to that &s;ide; in&s;omuch that he wrote to <HI>Dara,</HI> forbidding him to come nearer, if he did, he would find the Gates &s;hut, and all in Arms.</P>
<P>Three days before I met this unhappy Prince, by a &s;trange Accident, when he obli|ged me to follow him, having no Phy&s;ician about him; and the Night before that he received this News from the Governor of <HI>Amadevad,</HI> he did me the favor to make me come into the <HI>Karavan-Serrak</HI> where he was, fearing le&s;t the <HI>Koulis</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me: And (what is hard enough to believe in <HI>Inde&s;tan,</HI> where the Grandees e&s;pecially are &s;o jeaous of their Wives) I was &s;o near to the Wife of this Prince, that the Cords of the <HI>Kanates,</HI> or Wind &s;creen, which enclo&s;ed them, (for they had not &s;o much as a poor Tent) were fa&s;tned to the wheels of my Chariot. I relate this circum&s;tance by the by only, to &s;hew the extremity <HI>Dara</HI> was reduced to.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="350">
When the&s;e Women heard this &s;ad News (which was at the break of day, as I well remember) they broke out upon a &s;udden into &s;uch &s;trange cryes and lamentations, that they forced tears from ones Eyes. And now behold all was in an unexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion: Every one looks upon his Neighbor, and no body knows what to do, or what will become of him. Soon after we &s;aw <HI>Dara</HI> come forth, half dead, now &s;peak|ing to one, then another, even to the meane&s;t Soldiers. He &s;eeth all a&s;toni&s;h'd, and ready to abandon him. What coun&s;el? whither can he go? he mu&s;t be gone in&s;tant|ly. You may judge of the extremity he mu&s;t needs be in, by this &s;mall accident I am going to mention. Of three great Oxen of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> which I had for my Chariot, one died the Night before, another was dying, and the third was tyred out, (for we had been forced to march for three days together, almo&s;t night and day, in an intole|rable heat and du&s;t:) Whatever <HI>Dara</HI> could &s;ay or command, whether he alledged it was for him&s;elf, or for one of his Women that was hurt in her Leg, or for me; he could not po&s;&s;ibly procure for me, whether Ox, or Camel, or Hor&s;e: So that he was obliged, to my good fortune, to leave me there. I &s;aw him march away, and that with tears in his Eyes, accompanied with four or five hundred Cavaliers at mo&s;t, and with two Elephants, that were &s;aid to be laden with Gold and Silver; and I heard them &s;ay, that they were to take their March towards <HI>Tatabakar;</HI> for he had no other Game to play, though even that &s;eem'd in a manner impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the &s;mall number of People left him, and the great &s;andy De&s;arts to be waded through in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on, mo&s;t of them without water fit to drink. And indeed mo&s;t of tho&s;e that fol|low'd him, and even divers of his Women, did there peri&s;h, either of drought, or the unwhol&s;om waters, or the tire&s;om ways and ill food; or la&s;tly, becau&s;e &s;tripped by the <HI>Koullis</HI> above-mention'd. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, <HI>Dara</HI> made hard &s;hift to get to the <HI>Raja Katche;</HI> unhappy even herein, that he peri&s;h'd not him&s;elf in this March.</P>
<P>This <HI>Raja</HI> at fir&s;t gave him a very good Reception, even &s;o far as to promi&s;e him a&s;&s;i&s;tance with all his Forces, provided he would give his Daughter in marriage to his Son. But <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> &s;oon wrought as much with this <HI>Raja,</HI> as he had done with <HI>Je&s;|&s;om&s;eigne;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Dara</HI> one day &s;eeing the kindne&s;s of this <HI>Barbarian,</HI> cooled upon a &s;udden, and that con&s;equently his Per&s;on was in danger there, he betakes him&s;elf to the pur&s;uit of his Expedition to <HI>Tatabakar.</HI></P>
<P>To relate how I got away from tho&s;e Robbers, the <HI>Koullis,</HI> in what manner I moved them to compa&s;&s;ion, how I &s;aved the be&s;t part of my &s;mall Trea&s;ure, how we became good Friends by the means of my Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick, my Servants (perplexed as well as my &s;elf) &s;wearing that I was the greate&s;t Phy&s;ician of the World, and that the People of <HI>Dara,</HI> at their going away, had ill treated me, and taken from me all my be&s;t things: How, after having kept me with them &s;even or eight days, they had &s;o much kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity, as to lend me an Ox, and to conduct me &s;o far, that I was in &s;ight of <HI>Amadevad:</HI> And la&s;tly, how from thence after &s;ome days I returned to <HI>Dehli,</HI> having lighted on an occa&s;ion to go with a certain <HI>Omrah</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thither; in which Journey I met from time to time, on the way, with Carka&s;&s;es of Men, Ele|phants, Oxen, Hor&s;es, and Camels, the remainder of that unfortunate Army of <HI>Dara.</HI> The&s;e are things, I &s;ay, I mu&s;t not in&s;i&s;t upon to de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Dara</HI> advanced towards <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> the War continues in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and much longer than was believed, <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> putting forth his utmo&s;t, and playing his la&s;t Game again&s;t <HI>Emir-Jemla:</HI> Yet this did not much trouble <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who knew 'twas a great way between <HI>Bengale</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and was &s;ufficiently convinced of the pru|dence and valor of <HI>Emir-Jemla.</HI> That which di&s;quieted him much more was, that he &s;aw <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> &s;o near (for from <HI>Agra</HI> to the Mountains 'tis but eight days Journey) whom he could not ma&s;ter, and who perpetually alarm'd him by the rumors that went continually about, as if he were coming down the Mountains with the <HI>Ra|ja.</HI> 'Tis certainly very hard to draw him thence: But behold how he manages the matter to compa&s;s it.</P>
<P>He maketh the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> write one Letter after another to the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> promi&s;ing him very great things, if he would &s;urrender <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> to him, and menacing War at the &s;ame time, if he &s;hould ob&s;tinately keep him. The <HI>Raja</HI> an|&s;wers, <HI>That he would rather lo&s;e his E&s;tate, than do &s;o unworthy an Action.</HI> And <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> &s;eeing his re&s;olution, taketh the Field, and marcheth directly to the foot of the
<PB N="31" REF="350">
Hills, and with an infinite number of Pike-men cau&s;eth the Rocks to be cut, and the pa&s;&s;age to be widen'd. But the <HI>Raja</HI> laughs at all that; neither hath he much cau&s;e to fear on that &s;ide. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> may cut long enough, they are Mountains inacce&s;&s;ible to an Army, and &s;tones would be &s;ufficient to &s;top the Forces of four <HI>Indo&s;tans;</HI> &s;o that he was con&s;trained to turn back again.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> in the mean time approacheth to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> and when he was but two or three days journey off, he received News, that <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> who had long held it be&s;ieged, had at length reduced it to extremity: As I afterwards learned of our <HI>French,</HI> and other <HI>Franguis</HI> that were there, a pound of Rice and Meat having co&s;t there above a Crown, and &s;o of other Victuals in proportion: Yet the Go|vernour held out; made Sallies, which extreamly incommoded the Enemy; and &s;hew'd all po&s;&s;ible prudence, courage and fidelity; deriding the endeavours of the General, <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> and all the menaces and promi&s;es of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>And this al&s;o I learned afterwards of my Country-men, the <HI>French,</HI> and of all tho&s;e other <HI>Franguis</HI> that were with him; who added, that when he heard <HI>Dara</HI> was not far off, he redoubled his liberalities, and knew &s;o well to gain the hearts of all his Souldiers, and to encourage them to do bravely, that there was not one of them, that was not re&s;olved to &s;ally out upon the Enemy, and to hazard all to rai&s;e the Siege, and to make <HI>Dara</HI> enter; and that he al&s;o knew &s;o well to ca&s;t fear and terrour into the Camp of <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> by &s;ending Spies about very cunningly to a&s;&s;ure, that they had &s;een <HI>Dara</HI> approach with great re&s;olution, and very good Forces; that if he had come, as was believed he would do every moment, the Army of the Ene|my was for disbanding upon his appearance, and even in part to go over to him. But he is &s;till too unfortunate, to undertake any thing pro&s;perou&s;ly. Believing there|fore, that to rai&s;e the Siege with &s;uch an handful of Men as he had, was impo&s;&s;ible; he did deliberate to pa&s;s the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and to endeavour to get into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> al|though that al&s;o would have had mighty difficulties and inconveniencies, by rea&s;on of the De&s;arts, and the &s;mall quantity of good waters in tho&s;e parts; be&s;ides, that upon tho&s;e Frontiers there are but mean <HI>Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> who acknowledge neither the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> nor the <HI>Mogol.</HI> But his Wife did very much di&s;&s;wade him from it, for this weak rea&s;on, that he mu&s;t, if he did &s;o, expect to &s;ee his Wife and Daughter Slaves of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> that that was a thing altogether unworthy of the Grandeur of his Family, and 'twas better to die, than to undergo this Infamy.</P>
<P><HI>Dara,</HI> being in great perplexity, remembred, that there was thereabout a certain <HI>Patan,</HI> powerful enough, called <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> who&s;e Life he had formerly &s;aved twice, when <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had commanded he &s;hould be ca&s;t under the feet of an Elephant, for having rebelled divers times: He re&s;olved to go to him, hoping that he could give him &s;ufficient Succours to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Tatabakar;</HI> making account, that thence he would take his Trea&s;ure, and that going from thence, and gaining <HI>Kandabar,</HI> he could ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Kingdom of <HI>Caboul,</HI> having great hopes of <HI>Mohabet-Kan,</HI> who was Governour of it, becau&s;e he was both potent and valiant, well beloved of his Country, and had obtained this Government by his <HI>(Dara</HI>'s) favour. But his Grandchild, <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> yet but very young, &s;eeing his de&s;ign, ca&s;t him&s;elf at his Feet, intreating him for God's &s;ake, not to enter into the Country of that <HI>Patan.</HI> His Wife and Daughter did the &s;ame, remon&s;trating to him, that he was a Robber, a revolted Governour, that he would infallibly betray him; that he ought not to &s;tand upon the rai&s;ing of the Siege, but rather endeavour to gain <HI>Caboul,</HI> that the thing was not impo&s;&s;ible, fora&s;much as <HI>Mir-baba</HI> was not like to quite the Siege to follow him, and to hinder him from getting thither.</P>
<P><HI>Dara,</HI> being carried head-long by the force of his unhappy De&s;tiny, rejected this coun&s;el, and would hearken to nothing of what was propo&s;ed to him, &s;aying, as was true, that the March would be very difficult, and very dangerous; and maintaining always, that <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> would not be &s;o mean, as to betray him, after all the good he had done him. He departed, notwith&s;tanding all that could be &s;aid to him; and went to prove, at the price of his Life, That no tru&s;t is to be given to a wicked Man.</P>
<P>This Robber, who at fir&s;t believed that he had numerous Troops following him, gave him the faire&s;t reception that could be, and entertained him with very great kindne&s;s and civility in appearance, placing his Souldiers here and there among his Subjects, with a &s;trict order to treat them well, and to give them what refre&s;hments
<PB N="32" REF="351">
the Country afforded: But when he found that he had not above two or three hun|dred Men in all, he quickly &s;how'd what he was. It is not known, whether he had not received &s;ome Letters from <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> or whether his avarice had not been tempted by &s;ome Mules &s;aid to be laden with Gold; which was all that could be &s;aved hitherto, as well from the hands of Robbers, as of tho&s;e that conveyed it. Whatever it be, on a certain morning, when no body looked for any &s;uch thing, all being taken up with the care of refre&s;hing them&s;elves, and believing all to be &s;afe; behold this Traitor, who had be&s;tir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d him&s;elf all night to get armed Men from all parts, fell upon <HI>Dara</HI> and <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> killed &s;ome of their Men that &s;tood up to de|fend them&s;elves; forgot not to &s;eize on the loads of the Mules, and of all the Jewels of the Women; made <HI>Dara</HI> to be tyed fa&s;t upon an Elephant, commanding the Exe|cutioner to fit behind, and to cut off his head upon the lea&s;t &s;ign given, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be &s;een to re&s;i&s;t, or that any one &s;hould attempt to deliver him. And in this &s;trange po&s;ture he was carried to the Army before <HI>Taba-bakar,</HI> where he put him into the hands of <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> the General, who cau&s;ed him to be conducted in the com|pany of this &s;ame Traitor to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dehli.</HI></P>
<P>When he was at the Gates of <HI>Dehli,</HI> it was deliberated by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> whether he &s;hould be made to pa&s;s through the mid&s;t of the City, or no, to carry him thence to <HI>Goualeor.</HI> Many did advi&s;e, that that was by no means to be done; that &s;ome di&s;order might ari&s;e; that &s;ome might come to &s;ave him; and be&s;ides, that it would be a great di&s;honour to the Family Royal. Others maintained the contrary&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> That it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould pa&s;s through the Town, to a&s;toni&s;h the World, and to &s;hew the ab&s;olute Power of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to di&s;abu&s;e the People, that might &s;till doubt, whether it were him&s;elf, as indeed many <HI>Omrahs</HI> did doubt; and to take away all hopes from tho&s;e, who &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome affection for him. The Opi|nion of the&s;e la&s;t was followed; he was put on an Elephant, his Grand-child, <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> at his &s;ide; and behind them was placed <HI>Bhadur-Kan,</HI> as an Executioner. This was none of tho&s;e brave Elephants of <HI>Ceilan</HI> or <HI>Pegu,</HI> which he was wont to ride on, with gilt Harne&s;s and embroidered Covers, and Seats with Canopies very hand|&s;omely painted and gilt, to defend them&s;elves from the Sun: It was an old Caitiff Animal, very dirty and na&s;ty, with an old torn Cover, and a pitiful Seat, all open. There was no more &s;een about him, that Necklace of big Pearls, which the&s;e Princes are wont to wear, nor tho&s;e rich Turbants and Ve&s;ts embroider'd. All his Dre&s;s was a Ve&s;t of cour&s;e Linnen, all dirty, and a Turbant of the &s;ame, with a wretched Scarf of <HI>Kachimere</HI> over his head, like a Varlet; his Grand-&s;on, <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> being in the &s;ame equipage. In this mi&s;erable po&s;ture he was made enter into the Town, and to pa&s;s through the greate&s;t Merchant-&s;treets, to the end that all the People might &s;ee him, and entertain no doubt any more whether it was he.</P>
<P>As for me, I fancied we went to &s;ee &s;ome &s;trange Ma&s;&s;acre, and was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the boldne&s;s of making him thus pa&s;s through the Town; and that the more, becau&s;e I knew that he was very ill guarded, neither was I ignorant, that he was very much beloved by the lower &s;ort of people, who at that time exclaimed highly again&s;t the cruelty and tyranny of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as one that kept his Father in pri&s;on, as al&s;o his own Son <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> I was well prepar'd for it, and with a good Hor&s;e and two good Men I went, together with two others of my Friends, to place my &s;elf in the greate&s;t &s;treet, where he was to pa&s;s. But not one Man had the boldne&s;s to draw his Sword, only there were &s;ome of the <HI>Fakires,</HI> and with them &s;ome poor people, who &s;eeing that infamous <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> ride by his &s;ide, began to rail and throw &s;tones at him, and to call him Traitor. All the Shops were ready to break for the crowd of Spectators, that wept bitterly; and there was heard nothing but loud Out-cryes and Lamentations, Invectives, and Cur&s;es, heaped on <HI>Gion-Kan.</HI> In a word, Men and Women, great and &s;mall (&s;uch is the tenderne&s;s of the hearts of the <HI>Indians)</HI> were ready to melt into tears for compa&s;&s;ion; but not one there was that dur&s;t &s;tir to re&s;cue him. Now after he had thus pa&s;&s;ed through the Town, he was put into a Garden called <HI>Heider-Abad.</HI></P>
<P>There were not wanting to tell <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> how the People at this &s;ight had la|mented <HI>Dara,</HI> and cur&s;ed the <HI>Patan,</HI> that had deliver'd him; and how the &s;ame was in danger to have been &s;toned to death, as al&s;o that there had been a great apprehen|&s;ion of &s;ome &s;edition and mi&s;chief. Hereupon another Council was held, whether
<PB N="33" REF="351">
he &s;hould indeed be carried to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> as had been concluded before; or whether it were not more expedient to put him to death, without more ado? Some were of opinion, that he &s;hould go to <HI>Goualeor</HI> with a &s;trong Guard, that that would be enough; <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> though <HI>Dara</HI>'s old Enemy, in&s;i&s;ting much upon that. But <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> in pur&s;uance of her hatred again&s;t this Brother of hers, pu&s;hed <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> to make him away, without running the danger there was in &s;ending him to <HI>Goualeor;</HI> as al&s;o did all his old Enemies, <HI>Galilullah-Kan,</HI> and <HI>Chah-he&s;t-Kan,</HI> and e&s;pecially a certain Flatterer, a Phy&s;itian, who was fled out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> fir&s;t called <HI>Hakim-Daoud,</HI> and afterwards being become a great <HI>Omrah</HI> named <HI>Takarrub-Kan:</HI> This Villain boldly ro&s;e up in a full a&s;&s;embly, and cryed out, that it was expedient for the &s;afety of the State to put him to death immediately, and that the rather, be|cau&s;e he was no <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman;</HI> that long &s;ince he was turn'd <HI>Kafire,</HI> Idolater, without Religion, and that he would charge the Sin of it upon his own head: Of which im|precation he &s;oon after felt the &s;mart; for within a &s;hort time he fell into di&s;grace, and was treated like an infamous Fellow, and dyed mi&s;erably. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> carried away by the&s;e in&s;tances and motives, commanded that he &s;hould be put to death, and that <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> his Grand-child, &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of this Tragical Execution was given to a certain Slave, call'd <HI>Nazer,</HI> that had been bred by <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and was known to have been formerly ill treated by <HI>Dara.</HI> This Executioner, accompanied with three or four Parricides more, went to <HI>Dara,</HI> who was then him&s;elf dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Lentils with <HI>Sepe-Chekouh</HI> his Grandchild. He no &s;ooner &s;aw <HI>Nazer,</HI> but cryed out to <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> My dear Son, behold tho&s;e that come to kill us! laying hold at the &s;ame time of a &s;mall Knife, which was all the Arms that were left him. One of the&s;e Butchers immediately fell upon <HI>Sepe-Chekouh;</HI> the others, upon the arms and legs of <HI>Dara,</HI> throwing him to the ground, and holding him under, 'till <HI>Nazer</HI> cut his throat. His Head was forth|with carried to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who pre&s;ently commanded it to be put in a di&s;h, and that water &s;hould be fetch'd; which when brought, he wiped it off with an Handkerchief, and after he had cau&s;ed the Face to be wa&s;hed clean, and the blood done away, and was fully &s;atisfied that it was the very head of <HI>Dara,</HI> he fell a weeping, and &s;aid the&s;e words; Ah <HI>Bed-Bakt!</HI> Ah unfortunate Man! Take it away, and bury it in the Sepulchre of <HI>Houmayon.</HI></P>
<P>At night, the Daughter of <HI>Dara</HI> was brought into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> but afterwards &s;ent to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> who asked her of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Concerning <HI>Dara</HI>'s Wife, &s;he had ended her days before at <HI>Lahor&punc;</HI> She had poy&s;on'd her &s;elf, fore&s;eeing the extremities &s;he was falling into, together with her Husband. <HI>Sepe-Chekouh</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor.</HI> And after a few days, <HI>Gion-kan</HI> was &s;ent for, to come before <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the A&s;&s;embly: To him were given &s;ome Pre&s;ents, and &s;o he was &s;ent away; but being near his Lands, he was rewarded according to his de&s;ert, being killed in a Wood. This barbarous Man not knowing, or not con&s;idering, that if Kings do &s;ometimes permit &s;uch Actions for their Intere&s;t, yet they abhor them, and &s;ooner or later revenge them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Governour of <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> by the &s;ame Orders that had been required of <HI>Dara,</HI> was obliged to &s;urrender the Fortre&s;s. It was indeed upon &s;uch a compo&s;ition as he would have, but it was al&s;o with an intention not to keep word with him. For the poor Eunuch, arriving at <HI>Lahor,</HI> was cut in pieces, together with tho&s;e few Men he had then with him, by <HI>Kalil-ullah-kan,</HI> who was Governour there|of. But the rea&s;on of the non-ob&s;ervance of the Capitulation was&punc; that there was come intelligence, that he &s;ecretly prepar'd him&s;elf to go directly to <HI>Soliman-Chekouh,</HI> &s;paring no Gold, which under-hand he conveyed into the hands of our <HI>Franguis,</HI> and to all tho&s;e that were come with him out of the Fortre&s;s to follow him, under pretext of accompanying him as far as <HI>Dehli</HI> to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who had often &s;aid, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee &s;o gallant a Man, and who had &s;o valiantly defended him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There remained therefore none of the Family of <HI>Dara,</HI> but <HI>Soliman-Chekouh,</HI> who could not ea&s;ily be drawn away from <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> if the <HI>Raja</HI> had been &s;teady to his fir&s;t Declarations. But the &s;ecret practices of the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> the promi&s;es and threats of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the death of <HI>Dara,</HI> and the other <HI>Rajas</HI> his Neighbours that had been gain'd, and were prepared by the Orders, and at the co&s;t of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to make War again&s;t him, did at la&s;t &s;hake the Faith of this perfidious Protector, and
<PB N="34" REF="352">
made him con&s;ent to their demands. <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> who was adverti&s;ed of it, fled through the mid&s;t of tho&s;e horrid Countries and fearful De&s;arts, towards the great <HI>Tibet.</HI> But the Son of the <HI>Raja,</HI> &s;oon pur&s;uing and overtaking him, cau&s;ed him to be a&s;&s;aulted with &s;tones. The poor Prince was hurt, &s;eized, and carried to <HI>Dehli,</HI> where he was impri&s;on'd in <HI>Serenguer,</HI> that little Fortre&s;s, where at fir&s;t they had put <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to ob&s;erve what he had practi&s;ed towards <HI>Dara,</HI> and that no body might doubt it was <HI>Soliman-Chekouh</HI> him&s;elf, commanded him to be brought before him in the pre&s;ence of all the Grandees of the Court. At the entry of the Gate, the Chains were taken from his feet&punc; leaving tho&s;e he had about his hands, which &s;eemed gilt. When this proper young Man, &s;o hand&s;ome and gallant, was &s;een to enter, there was a good number of <HI>Omrahs</HI> that could not hold their tears; and, as I was in|formed, all the great Ladies of the Court, that had leave to &s;ee him come in, fell a weeping. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who appear'd him&s;elf to be touched at his misfortunes, began to &s;peak very kindly to him, and to comfort him; telling him among&s;t other things, that he &s;hould fear nothing, that no hurt &s;hould be done to him; on the contrary, that he &s;hould be well treated, and therefore be of good courage; that he had cau&s;ed his Father to be put to death for no other rea&s;on, than that he was turn'd <HI>Kafer,</HI> and a Man without Religion. Whereupon this young Prince returned him the <HI>Salem,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed him, aba&s;ing his hands to the earth, and lifting them, as well as he could, up to his head, after the cu&s;tom of the Country; and told him with re&s;olution enough, That if he were to drink the <HI>Pou&s;t,</HI> he intreated him that he might dye pre&s;ently, being very willing to &s;ubmit to his Fate. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> promi&s;ed him publickly, that he &s;hould drink none of it; that he &s;hould re&s;t &s;atisfied as to that, and not en|tertain any &s;ad thoughts about it. This being &s;aid, he once more repeated the <HI>Salem:</HI> And after they had asked him &s;everal Que&s;tions, in the Name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> touch|ing that Elephant which was charged with Roupies of Gold, taken from him when he went to <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> he was &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor</HI> to the re&s;t. This <HI>Pou&s;t</HI> is nothing el&s;e el&s;e but Poppy expre&s;&s;ed, and infu&s;ed a night in water. And 'tis that potion, which tho&s;e that are kept at <HI>Goualeor,</HI> are commonly made to drink; I mean tho&s;e Princes, who&s;e heads they think not fit to cut off: This is the fir&s;t thing that is brought them in the morning, and they have nothing given them to eat 'till they have drunk a great cup full of it; they would rather let them &s;tarve. This emaciates them exceedingly, and maketh them dye in&s;en&s;ibly, they lo&s;ing little by little their &s;trength and under|&s;tanding, and growing torpid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. And by this very means 'tis &s;aid, that <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> and the Grand-child of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and <HI>Soliman-Chekouh,</HI> were di&s;patch'd.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> he was made away by a more violent death. For <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;eeing, that though he was in pri&s;on, yet the generality had an inclination to him, and that many Ver&s;es were &s;pread in the prai&s;e of his Valour and Courage, thought him&s;elf not &s;afe enough by putting him to death in private, by giving him <HI>Pou&s;t</HI> like others; apprehending, that his Death would be &s;till doubted of, and that that might one time or other occa&s;ion &s;ome commotion, and therefore devi&s;ed the following Charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Children of a certain <HI>Sayed,</HI> very rich, whom he had cau&s;ed to be put to death in <HI>Amadevad,</HI> to get his E&s;tate, when he there made his preparations for War, and borrowed or took by force great Sums of Money from all the rich Merchants, ap|peared in full A&s;&s;embly, making their complaints, and demanding Ju&s;tice, and the Head of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> for the Blood of their Father. Not one of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> dur&s;t contradict it, both becau&s;e he was a <HI>Sayed,</HI> that is, one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Kindred, to whom great Veneration was paid; and that every body &s;ufficiently under&s;tood the de|&s;ign of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> taking this for a pretence to rid him&s;elf openly of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> under a &s;hew of Ju&s;tice. So that the Head of him, that had killed the Father of the Plaintiffs, was granted them without any other form of Proce&s;s. Whereupon they went, with nece&s;&s;ary Orders i&s;&s;ued out for that purpo&s;e, to cut it off in <HI>Goualeor.</HI></P>
<P>There remained no other Thorn in the Foot of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> but <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who kept him&s;elf &s;till in <HI>Bengale;</HI> but he al&s;o was forced to yield at la&s;t to the power and fortune of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> There were &s;ent &s;o many Troops of all &s;orts to <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> that at la&s;t he was encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, both on this and that &s;ide of the River
<PB N="35" REF="352">
<HI>Ganges;</HI> &s;o that he was nece&s;&s;itated to flye to <HI>Dake,</HI> which is the la&s;t Town of <HI>Ben|gale</HI> on the Sea &s;ide; and here comes the conclu&s;ion of this whole Tragedy.</P>
<P>This Prince being de&s;titute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whether to &s;lye, &s;ent his elde&s;t Son, <HI>Sultan-Banque,</HI> to the King of <HI>Racan</HI> or <HI>May,</HI> a Heathen or Idolatrous King, to know whether he would give him leave to make his Country his place of refuge only for &s;ome time, and do him the favour, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> or the Sea&s;on-winds &s;hould come, to furni&s;h him with a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ha,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">om thence to pa&s;s into &s;ome part of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That King &s;ent an&s;wer&punc; that he &s;hould be very welcome, and have all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance. So <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> returned to <HI>Dake</HI> with &s;ome Galea&s;&s;es, manned with <HI>Franguis</HI> (I mean, with tho&s;e fugitive <HI>Portugals,</HI> and other &s;traggling Chri&s;tians, that had put them&s;elves in &s;ervice to that King, driving no other Trade than to ravage all this lower <HI>Bengale;</HI> upon which <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> embarked, with his whole Family, <HI>viz.</HI> his Wife, his three Sons, and Daughters. They were well enough received; whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, &s;uch as that Coun|trey would afford, was provided for them, in the name of that King. Some months pa&s;s, the Sea&s;on of the favourable Winds come in, but not a word of the Ve&s;&s;el, though he demanded it no otherwi&s;e than for his Money; for as yet he wanted not Rupies of Gold, nor Silver, nor G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ms: He had too great a plenty of them; his Riches were, in all appearance, the cau&s;e of his ruin, or at lea&s;t contributed much to it. Tho&s;e barbarous Kings have no true genero&s;ity, and are not much refrained by the Faith they have given, regarding nothing but their pre&s;ent Intere&s;ts, without &s;o much as con&s;idering the mi&s;chiefs that may befall them for their perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and brutality. To get out of their hands, one mu&s;t either be the &s;tronger, or have nothing that may tempt their avarice. <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> may long enough &s;ollicit for a Ve&s;&s;el; all is in vain, he effects nothing: On the contrary, the King begins to &s;hew much coldne&s;s, and to complain of his not coming to &s;ee him. I know not, whether <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> thought it unworthy of him&s;elf, and too mean a thing to give him a Vi&s;it; or rather, whether he fear'd, that being in the Kings Hou&s;e he might not there be &s;eized on, to take a|way all his Trea&s;ure, and then be delivered into the hands of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> who for that purpo&s;e promi&s;ed, in the name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> great Sums of Mony, and many other con&s;iderable advantages. Whatever the matter was, he would not go thither him&s;elf, but &s;ent his Son <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> who being near the Kings Hou&s;e, began to &s;hew liberality to the people, throwing out to them a good quantity of half Rupies, and whole Rupies, of Gold and Silver. And being come before the King, he pre&s;ented him with &s;tore of Embroideries, and of rare pieces of Gold&s;miths-work, &s;et with pre|cious Stones of great value, excu&s;ing his Father, <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> as being indi&s;po&s;ed, and be&s;eeching him in his name, that he would remember the Ve&s;&s;el, and the promi&s;e made to him thereof. But all that did not advance his bu&s;ine&s;s; on the contrary, five or &s;ix days after, this King &s;ent to <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> to ask of him one of his Daugh|ters in Marriage; which he could never re&s;olve to grant him, whereat this barbarous Prince was highly offended. What then could he do in this ca&s;e? The Sea&s;on pa&s;&s;eth away. What &s;hall become of him? What other re&s;olution can he take, but to do a de&s;perate Action? Behold a &s;trange undertaking, which may give a great Example of what De&s;pair can do!</P>
<P>Although this King of <HI>Racan</HI> be an Heathen, yet there is in his Dominions &s;tore of <HI>Mahumetans</HI> mingled with the people, that are retired thither, or have been, for the mo&s;t part, taken Slaves, here and there, by tho&s;e <HI>Franguis</HI> above-mention'd. <HI>Sul|tan Sujah</HI> did und r-hand gain the&s;e <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> and with two or three hundred Men, whom he had yet remaining of tho&s;e that follow'd him from <HI>Bengale,</HI> he re&s;olved, one day to fall unpectedly upon the Hou&s;e of this Barbarian, to kill all, and to make him&s;elf proclaim'd King of <HI>Recan.</HI> This was a very bold Enterpri&s;e, and &s;uch a one, as had more of a <HI>De&s;perado</HI> in it, than of a prudent Man. Yet notwith&s;tanding, as I was inform'd, and by what I could learn from many <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that then were there pre&s;ent, the thing was fea&s;ible enough. But the day before the &s;troke was to be given, the De&s;ign was di&s;cover'd; which did altogether overthrow the Affairs of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and was &s;oon after the cau&s;e of his ruin. For not finding hereafter any way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e to recover him&s;elf, he attempted to &s;lye towards <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gu;</HI> which was a thing in a manner impo&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t Mountains and Forre&s;ts to be pa&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides, he was immediately pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e, that he was over|taken
<PB N="36" REF="353">
the &s;ame day he fled. It may well be thought, that he defended him&s;elf with as much courage as was po&s;&s;ible. He killed &s;o many of tho&s;e Barbarians, that it will &s;carce be believed, but he was &s;o overpow'red by the multitude of pur&s;uers, that he was obliged to quit the Combat. <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> who was not &s;o far advanced as his Father, defended him al&s;o like a Lion; but at length, being all bloody of the wounds, by &s;tones poured upon him from all &s;ides, he was &s;eized on, and carried away, with his two little Brothers, his Si&s;ters, and Mother.</P>
<P>As to the Per&s;on of <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> him&s;elf, all what could be learnt of it, is this: That he, with one Woman, one Eunuch, and two other per&s;ons, got up to the top of the Mountain; that he received a wound in his Head by a &s;tone, which &s;truck him down, but yet he ro&s;e again&punc; the Eunuch having wound his Head about with his Turbant, and that they e&s;caped through the mid&s;t of the Woods.</P>
<P>I have heard the Relation three or four other manner of ways, even by tho&s;e per|&s;ons that were upon the place. Some did a&s;&s;ure, that he had been found among the dead, but was not well known: And I have &s;een a Letter of the Chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, confirming this. So that 'tis difficult enough to know aright what is be|come him. And this it is, which hath admini&s;tred ground to tho&s;e &s;o frequent Alarms, given us afterwards at <HI>Dehli:</HI> For at one time it was rumored, that he was arrived at <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> to joyn with the Kings of <HI>Golkonda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour;</HI> another time it was related for certain, that he had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of <HI>Suratte</HI> with two Ships, bearing the Red Colours, which the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> or the King of <HI>Siam</HI> had given him; by and by, that he was in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and had been &s;een in <HI>Chiras,</HI> and &s;oon after in <HI>Kandahar,</HI> ready to enter into the Kingdom of <HI>Caboul</HI> it &s;elf. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> one day &s;aid &s;miling, that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was at la&s;t become an <HI>Agy</HI> or Pilgrim. And at this very day there are abundance of per&s;ons who maintain that he is in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> returned from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whence he is &s;aid to have brought with him much Money. But that which confirms more than enough, that there is no ground for any of the&s;e reports, is that Letter of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and that an Eunuch of his, with whom I travelled from <HI>Bengale</HI> to <HI>Ma|&s;lipatan,</HI> as al&s;o the Great Ma&s;ter of his Artillery; whom I &s;aw in the Service of the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> have a&s;&s;ured me, that he is no more in being, though they made difficulty to &s;ay any more concerning him; as al&s;o, that our <HI>French</HI> Merchants, that lately came out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and from <HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> when I was yet at <HI>Dehli,</HI> had in tho&s;e parts heard no news at all of him; be&s;ides that, I have heard that a while after his Defeat, his Sword and Poynard had been found: So that 'tis credible, that if he was not killed upon the place, he &s;oon dyed afterwards, and was the prey of &s;ome Robbers, or Tygers, or Elephants, of which the Forre&s;ts of that Country are full. However it be, after this la&s;t Action his whole Family was put in Pri&s;on, Wives, and Children, where they were treated rudely enough; yet &s;ome time after they were &s;et at more liberty, and they received a milder entertainment: And then the King called for the elde&s;t Daughter, whom he married.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was doing, &s;ome Servants of <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> joyned with divers of tho&s;e <HI>Mahumetans</HI> which I have mentioned, went to plot another Con&s;piracy like the fir&s;t. But the day appointed for it being come, one of the Con&s;pirators, being half drunk, began too &s;oon to break out. Concerning this al&s;o I have heard forty different rela|tions, &s;o that 'tis very hard to know the truth of it. That which is undoubted is this, that the King was at length &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t this unfortunate Family of <HI>Sujah,</HI> that he commanded it &s;hould be quite rooted out. Neither did there remain any one of it, that was not put to death, &s;ave that Daughter which the King had made his Wife. <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> and his Brothers, had their Heads cut off with blunt Axes; and the Women were mured up, where they dyed of hunger and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>And thus endeth this War, which the lu&s;t of Reigning had kindled among tho&s;e four Brothers, after it had la&s;ted five or &s;ix years, from 1655, or thereabout, to 1660 or 1661; which left <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this pui&s;&s;ant Empire.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OR, The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages after the War for Five Years, or thereabout, in the Empire of the GREAT MOGOL.</HEAD>
<P>THE War being ended, the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>&V;sbec</HI> entertained thoughts of &s;end|ing Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> They had &s;een him fight in their Coun|trey, when he was yet a young Prince; <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> having &s;ent him to command the Succors, which the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Samarkand</HI> had de&s;ired of him again&s;t the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Balk.</HI> They had experienced his Conduct and Valor on many occa&s;ions, and they con&s;ider'd with them&s;elves, that he could not but remem|ber the Affront they did him, when he was ju&s;t taking <HI>Balk,</HI> the Capital Town of the Enemy: For the two <HI>Kans</HI> agreed together, and obliged him to retreat, alledging, That they apprehended he might render him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of their whole State, ju&s;t as <HI>Ekbar</HI> had formerly done of the Kingdom of <HI>Kachimere.</HI> Be&s;ides, they had certain intelligence of all he had done in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> of his Battels, Fortune, and Advantages; whence they might &s;ufficiently e&s;timate, that though <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was yet living, yet <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was Ma&s;ter, and the only Per&s;on that was to be owned King of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Whether then they feared his ju&s;t re&s;entments, or whether it was, that their inbred Avarice and Sordidne&s;s made them hope for &s;ome con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent, the two <HI>Kans</HI> &s;ent to him their Amba&s;&s;adors to offer him their Service, and to Congratulate him up|on the happy beginning of his Reign. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;aw very well, that the War being at an end, this offer was out of &s;ea&s;on, and that it was nothing but fear or hope, as we &s;aid, that had brought them. Yet for all this, he received them honourably; and, &s;ince I was pre&s;ent at their Audience, I can relate the Particulars of it with cer|tainty.</P>
<P>They made their Reverence at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from him, after the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom, putting thrice their hands upon their heads, and as often letting them down to the ground. Then they approached &s;o near, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf might very well have taken their Letters immediately from their hands; but yet it was an <HI>Omrah</HI> that took and open'd them, and gave them to him. He forthwith read them with a very grave countenance; and afterwards commanded, there &s;hould be given to each of them an embroider'd Ve&s;t, a Turbant, and a Girdle of Silk in Embroidery, which is that which they call <HI>Ser-apah,</HI> that is, an Habit from head to foot. After this, their Pre&s;ents were call'd for, which con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome Boxes of choice <HI>Lapis Lazulus,</HI> divers Camels with long hair, &s;everal gallant Hor&s;es, &s;ome Camel-loads of fre&s;h Fruit, as Apples, Pears, Rai&s;ins and Melons, (for 'tis chiefly <HI>&V;sbec</HI> that furni&s;hes the&s;e &s;orts of Fruit, eaten at <HI>Dehli</HI> all the Winter-long;) and in many Loads of dry Fruit, as Prunes of <HI>Bokara,</HI> Aprecocks, Rai&s;ms without any &s;tones that appeared, and two other &s;orts of Rai&s;ins, black and white, very large and very good.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not wanting to declare, how much he was &s;atisfied with the Ge|nero&s;ity of the <HI>Kans,</HI> and much commended the Beauty and Rarity of the Fruit, Hor|&s;es, and Camels; and after he had a little entertain'd them of the &s;tate of the Acade|my of <HI>Samarkand,</HI> and of the Fertility of their Countrey, abounding in &s;o many rare and excellent things, he de&s;ired them to go and repo&s;e them&s;elves, intimating with|all, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee them often.</P>
<P>They came away from their Audience full of contentment and joy, not being much troubled, that they had been obliged to make their Reverence after the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom, though it have &s;omething of &s;lavi&s;h in it; nor much re&s;enting it, that the King had
<PB N="38" REF="354">
not taken their Letters from their own hands. I believe if they had been required to ki&s;s the ground, and even to do &s;omething of a lower nature, they would have com|plied with it. 'Tis true, it would have been in vain, if they had de&s;ired to make no other Salute, but that of their own Countrey, and to deliver to the King their Letters with their own hands; for that belongs only to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor have the&s;e this favour granted them, but with much difficulty.</P>
<P>They &s;tay'd above four months at <HI>Dehli,</HI> what diligence &s;oever they could u&s;e to be di&s;patch'd, which did incommode them very much; for they fell almo&s;t all &s;ick, and even &s;ome of them dyed, becau&s;e they were not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch heats as are in <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI> or rather becau&s;e they were &s;ordid, and kept a very ill Diet. I know not whe|ther there be a more avaricious and uncleanly Nation than they are. They laid up the Money which the King had appointed them for their mainten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nce, and lived a very mi|&s;erable life, altogether unworthy of Amba&s;&s;adors; yet they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with great honour: The King, in the pre&s;ence of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> pre&s;ented each of them with two rich <HI>Ser-apahs,</HI> and gave order that Eight thou&s;and <HI>Rupies</HI> &s;hould be carried to their Lodgings, which amounted to near Two thou&s;and Crowns each. He al&s;o gave them for Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Kans</HI> their Ma&s;ters, very hand&s;om <HI>Ser-apahs,</HI> &s;tore of the riche&s;t and be&s;t wrought Embroideries, a good quantity of fine Cloth, and Silk-&s;tuffs, wrought with Gold and Silver, and &s;ome Tape&s;tries, and two Poynards &s;et about with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>During their &s;tay, I went thrice to &s;ee them, being pre&s;ented to them as a Phy&s;ician by one of my Friends, that was Son of an <HI>&V;shec,</HI> that had made his Fortune in that Court. I had a de&s;ign to have learned &s;omething in particular of their Countrey, but I found them &s;o ignorant, that they knew not &s;o much as the Confines of their State, much le&s;s could they inform me of any thing concerning the <HI>Tartars</HI> that have conquer'd <HI>China</HI> of late years: In &s;hort, they told me nothing that I knew not before. I had once the Curio&s;ity to dine with them, which liberty I obtained ea&s;ily enough. They are not Men of much Ceremony; it was a very extraordinary Meal for &s;uch a one as I, it being mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hor&s;e-fle&s;h; yet for all this I got my Dinner with them; there was a certain Ragou, which I thought pa&s;&s;able: And I was obliged to expre&s;s a liking of &s;o exqui&s;ite a Di&s;h, which they &s;o much lu&s;t after. During Dinner, there was a &s;trange &s;ilence; they were very bu&s;ie in carrying in with their whole hands, for they know not what a Spoon is; but after that this Hor&s;e-fle&s;h had wrought in their &s;tomachs, they began to talk, and then they would per&s;wade me, they were the mo&s;t dextrous at Bows and Arrows, and the &s;tronge&s;t Men in the World. They call'd for Bows, which are much bigger than tho&s;e of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and would lay a wager, to pierce an Ox or my Hor&s;e through and through. Then they proceeded to commend the &s;trength and valor of their Women, which they de&s;cribed to me quite otherwi&s;e than the <HI>Amazons,</HI> telling me very wonderful &s;tories of them, e&s;pecially one, which would be admirable indeed, if I could relate it with a <HI>Tartarian</HI> Eloquence, as they did: They told me, that at the time when <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made War in their Countrey, a Party of Twenty five or Thirty <HI>Indian</HI> Hor&s;emen came to fall upon a &s;mall Village; whil&s;t they plundred, and tyed all tho&s;e whom they met with to make them Slaves, an old Woman &s;aid to them, <HI>Children, be not &s;o mi&s;chievous, my Daughter is not far off, &s;he will be here very &s;hortly, re|treat if you be wi&s;e, you are undone if &s;he light upon you.</HI> They laughed at the old Wo|man, and her Advice; and continued to load, to tye, and to carry away her &s;elf; but they were not gone half a Mile, but this old Woman, looking often backward, made a great out-cry of Joy, perceiving her Daughter coming after her on Hor&s;e-back; and pre&s;ently this generous She <HI>Tartar,</HI> mounted on a furious Hor&s;e, her Bow and Arrows hanging at her &s;ide, called to them at a di&s;tance, that &s;he was yet willing to give them their Lives, if they would carry back to the Village all they had taken, and then with|draw without any noi&s;e. The Advice of this young Woman affected them as little as that of her old Mother; but they were &s;oon a&s;toni&s;h'd, when they found her let flie at them in a moment three or four great Arrows, which &s;truck as many of their Men to the ground, which forced them to fall to their Quivers al&s;o. But &s;he kept her &s;elf at that di&s;tance from them, that none of them could reach her. She laughed at all their Effort, and at all their Arrows, knowing how to attack them at the length of her Bow, and to take her mea&s;ure from the &s;trength of her Arm, which was of another temper than theirs: So that after &s;he had killed half of them with her Arrows, and
<PB N="39" REF="354">
put them into di&s;order, &s;he came and fell upon the re&s;t with the Zable in her hand, and cut them all in pieces.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Tartary</HI> were not yet gone away from <HI>Dehli,</HI> when <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> fell exceeding &s;ick; a violent and continued Fever made him &s;ometimes lo&s;e his un|der&s;tanding: His Tongue was &s;eized with &s;uch a Pal&s;ie, that he lo&s;t almo&s;t his &s;peech, and the Phy&s;icians de&s;paired of his Recovery; nothing was heard for the time, than that he was gone, and that his Si&s;ter <HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> concealed his death out of de|&s;ign. It was already bruited, that the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> Governor of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> was on the way to deliver <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> that <HI>Mohabet-Kan</HI> (who had at length obeyed the Orders of <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> quitting the Government of <HI>Caboul,</HI> and being already on this &s;ide <HI>Lahor</HI> to come back, made ha&s;te al&s;o with Three or four thou&s;and Hor&s;e for the &s;ame end; and that the Eunuch <HI>Etbar-kan,</HI> who kept <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra,</HI> would have the honour of his delivery. On one &s;ide we &s;ee <HI>Sultan Mazum</HI> be&s;tir him&s;elf exceedingly with Bribes, endeavouring by Promi&s;es to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o far, as that one Night he went di&s;gui&s;ed to the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> entreat|ing him with expre&s;&s;ions of deep re&s;pect, that he would engage him&s;elf for his in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>We knew from other hands, that <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> together with <HI>Today-kan,</HI> the great Ma&s;ter of Artillery, and many <HI>Omrahs,</HI> declared for the young Prince <HI>Sultan Ek|bar,</HI> the third Son of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> though he was but &s;even or eight years old; both Parties in the mean time pretending, they had no other de&s;ign than to deliver <HI>Chah-Jehan:</HI> &s;o that the People believed, that now he was going to be &s;et at liberty, though none of the Grandees had any &s;uch thing in their thoughts, &s;preading this Rumor, on|ly to gain Credit and Concour&s;e, and becau&s;e they feared, le&s;t by the means of <HI>Etbar-kan,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;ecret Intrigue, he &s;hould one day appear in the Field. And indeed of all the Parties, there was not one that had rea&s;on to wi&s;h for his liberty and re&s;tora|tion to the Throne, except <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne, Mohabet-kan,</HI> and &s;ome others, that as yet had done no great matter to his di&s;advantage. The re&s;t had been all again&s;t him, at lea&s;t they had vilely abandon'd him. They knew very well he would be like an un|chain'd Lyon, if he came abroad: Who then could tru&s;t him? And what could <HI>Etbar-kan</HI> hope for, who had kept him up &s;o clo&s;e? I know not, if by &s;ome Adventure or other, he &s;hould have come cut of Pri&s;on, whether he would not have &s;tood &s;ingle, and been alone of his Party.</P>
<P>But though <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was very &s;ick, yet for all this he gave order for all things, and particularly for the &s;ure cu&s;tody of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Father; and though he had advi&s;ed <HI>Sultan Mazum</HI> to go and open the Gates to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould die, yet he omitted not to have <HI>Etbar-kan</HI> ince&s;&s;antly writ to. And the fifth day, in the height of his &s;ickne&s;s, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried into the A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Om|rahs</HI> to &s;hew him&s;elf, and to di&s;abu&s;e tho&s;e who might believe him to be dead, and to obviate popular Tumults, or &s;uch Accidents as might have cau&s;ed <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to be &s;et at liberty. The &s;eventh, ninth, and tenth day, he made him&s;elf to be carried again into the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and, what is almo&s;t incredible, the thir|teenth, after he had recollected him&s;elf from a Fit of Swooning, which occa&s;ioned a rumor through the whole Town of his being dead, he called for two or three of the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> to let them &s;ee that he was alive, made him|&s;elf to be rai&s;ed in his Bed, called for Ink and Paper to write to <HI>Etbar-kan,</HI> and &s;ent for the Great Seal, which he had tru&s;ted with <HI>Rauchenara-Bagum,</HI> and commonly en|clo&s;ed in a &s;mall Bag, &s;ealed with a Seal he always wore about his Arm, fearing le&s;t &s;he had already made u&s;e of it for her de&s;igns. I was nigh my <HI>Agah,</HI> when all this News was told him, and I under&s;tood, that lifting up his hands to Heaven, he &s;aid, <HI>What a Soul is this? A matchle&s;s Fortitude and Courage of Spirit! God pre&s;erve thee</HI> Aureng-Zebe, <HI>for greater things, certainly he will not that thou &s;houlde&s;t yet die.</HI> And indeed af|ter this Fit, he recover'd by little and little.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner recover'd his health, but he &s;ought to get out of the hands of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Dara,</HI> to &s;ecure the Marriage of <HI>Sul|tan-Ekhar,</HI> his third Son, with this Prince&s;s, on purpo&s;e thereby to gain him Authori|ty, and to give him the greater right to the Empire: For he it is, who is thought to be by him de&s;igned for it. He is yet very young, but he hath many near and powerful Relations at the Court, and is born of the Daughter of <HI>Chah-Navaze-kan,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="40" REF="355">
of the Blood of the Ancient Sovereigns of <HI>Machate;</HI> whereas <HI>Sultan Mah|moud</HI> and <HI>Sultan Mazum</HI> are only Sons of <HI>Ragipontnis,</HI> or Daughters of <HI>Raja's.</HI> The&s;e Kings, though <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> do, for all that, marry of the Daughters of the Heathen, either for State-intere&s;t, or for extraordinary Beauty. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> was di&s;ap|pointed in this de&s;ign: It will hardly be believed, with what height and fiercene&s;s of &s;pirit <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> and <HI>Begum</HI> rejected the Propo&s;ition, and the young Prince&s;s her &s;elf, who, in the fear of being carried away, was for &s;ome days de&s;perate, and prote&s;ted &s;he would rather kill her &s;elf an hundred times over, if it were po&s;&s;ible, than to mar|ry the Son of him that had murthered her Father.</P>
<P><HI>He had no better &s;atisfaction from</HI> Chah-Jehan <HI>about certain Jewels which he asked of him, in order to fini&s;h a piece of work which he cau&s;ed to be added to a famous Throne, which is &s;o highly e&s;teemed. For he fiercely an&s;wer'd,</HI> That <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould take no other Care, but to rule better than he did; that he &s;hould let his Throne alone; that he was weary to hear of the&s;e Jewels; and that the Hammers were ready to beat them to du&s;t, the fir&s;t time he &s;hould be importun'd again about them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not be the la&s;t in doing Reverence to <HI>Aureng-Zebe:</HI> they had thoughts of &s;ending an Amba&s;&s;ador to him. They pitched upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>Adrican,</HI> the Commander of their Factory at <HI>Suratte;</HI> and being a right hone&s;t man, and of good &s;en&s;e and judgment, not neglecting to take the coun&s;el of his Friends, he well acquit|ted him&s;elf of this Employment. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> though he carries it very high, and affects to appear a zealous <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and con&s;equently to de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Franguis,</HI> or Chri&s;tians, yet thought fit to receive them with much Re&s;pect and Civility. He even was de&s;irous, that this Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould complement him in the mode of the <HI>Fran|guis,</HI> after he had been made to do it the <HI>Indian</HI> way. 'Tis true, he received his Letters by the hand of an <HI>Omrah;</HI> but <HI>that</HI> was not to be taken for any Contempt, he having &s;hew'd no more Honour to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>&V;sbec.</HI> After this, he intimated to him, that he might produce his Pre&s;ent; and at the &s;ame time he cau&s;ed him, and &s;ome of his Train, to be dre&s;&s;ed with a <HI>Ser-Apah</HI> embroider'd. The Pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ted of &s;tore of very fine Scarlet, &s;ome large Looking-gla&s;&s;es, and divers excellent pieces of <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> work, among which there was a <HI>Paleky,</HI> and a <HI>Tack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">avan,</HI> or a Field-Throne of admirable workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;ador was not &s;o &s;oon di&s;patch'd as he wi&s;h'd, it being the Cu&s;tom of the Kings of <HI>Mogol</HI> to detain Amba&s;&s;adors as long as they well can, from a belief they have, that 'tis the intere&s;t of their Greatne&s;s, to oblige Strangers to give long At|tendance at their Court; yet he was not kept &s;o long as the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>&V;sbec.</HI> Mean time he had the misfortune, that his Secretary died there, and the re&s;t of his Re|tinue began to grow &s;ick. When the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, he gave him &s;uch another <HI>Ser-Apah</HI> embroider'd, as the fir&s;t was for him&s;elf; and another, a very rich one, for the General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> together with a Poynard, &s;et about with Jewels, all accompa|nied with a very obliging Letter.</P>
<P>The chief Aim of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in this Emba&s;&s;y was, to make them&s;elves imme|diately known to the King, thereby to gain Credit, and to intimidate the Governors of the Sea-Ports, and other places, where they have their Factories; that &s;o they may not attempt, when they plea&s;e, to in&s;ult over them, or to trouble them in their Trade; thereby letting them know, that they had to do with a potent Nation, and that hath a door open to addre&s;s them&s;elves, and to complain immediately to the King. Their End al&s;o was, to make it appear, what intere&s;t the King had in their Commerce; and therefore they &s;hew'd long Rolls of Commodities, bought up by them through the whole Kingdom, and Li&s;ts of con&s;iderable Sums of Gold and Silver&punc; every year brought thither by them; but &s;aying not a word of tho&s;e which they draw thence, from the Copper, Lead, Cinamon, Cloves, Mu&s;cadin, Pepper, Wood of Aloes, Elephants, and other Commodities which they vend there.</P>
<P>About this time, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Omrahs</HI> of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to him, and repre&s;ented, that this multitude and variety of perplexing Affairs, and this perpetual Attention of mind in him, might &s;oon cau&s;e a great Alteration in his Temper, and a dangerous Inconvenience in his Health. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> &s;eeming to take almo&s;t no notice of what that <HI>Omrah</HI> &s;aid, turn'd him&s;elf another way, and approaching to another of the prime <HI>Omrahs</HI> of the Court, a per&s;on of great know|ledge and judgment, &s;poke to him in this purpo&s;e (as I was informed by the Son of this Lord, who was my Friend.)</P>

You other Sages, are you not all of the mind, that there are times and conjunctions &s;o urgent, that a King ought to hazard his life for his Subjects, and &s;acrifice him&s;elf for their defence with Arms in his hands? And yet this effeminate Man would di&s;&s;wade me from ta|king pains, and dehort me from watching and &s;ollicitude for the Publick; and carry me by pretences of Health, to the thoughts of an ea&s;ie life, by abandoning the Government of my People, and the management of Affairs, to &s;ome Vi&s;ir or other. Doth he not know, that Providence having given me a Royal Extraction, and rai&s;ed me to the Crown of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> hath not made me for my &s;elf alone, but for the good and &s;afety of the Publick, and for the procurement of Tranquility and Happine&s;s to my Subjects, as far as that may be obtained by Ju&s;tice and Power? He &s;eeth not the con&s;equence of his Coun&s;els, and what mi&s;chiefs do at|tend Vi&s;ir&s;hips. Doth he think it to be without rea&s;on, what our Grand <HI>Sady</HI> hath &s;o generou&s;ly pronounced, O Kings, cea&s;e, cea&s;e to be Kings, or govern your Kingdoms your &s;elves? Go tell thy Countrey-man, that I &s;hall well like of the care he is con&s;tantly to take of the faith|ful di&s;charge of his Place; but advi&s;e him al&s;o, not any more to run out him&s;elf &s;o far as he hath done. We have <HI>natural</HI> inclination enough to a long, ea&s;ie, and carele&s;s life, and there need no Coun&s;ellors to &s;hake off bu&s;ine&s;s and trouble. Our Wives, that lie in our bo&s;om, do too often, be&s;ides our own genius, incline us that way.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time there happen'd an Accident, that made a great noi&s;e at <HI>Dehli,</HI> e&s;|pecially in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and di&s;abu&s;ed a great many, that could as hardly believe as my &s;elf, that Eunuchs, though they had their Genitals quite cut away, could become amorous as other men. <HI>Didar-kan,</HI> one of the chief Eunuchs of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> who had built an hou&s;e, where he came often to divert him&s;elf, fell in love with a very beautiful Woman, the Si&s;ter of a Neighbor of his, that was an Heathen Scri|vener.</P>
<P>The&s;e Amours la&s;ted a good while, before any Body blamed them, &s;ince it was but an Eunuch that made them, which &s;ort of men have the priviledge to go where they plea&s;e; but the familiarity grew &s;o great, and &s;o extraordinary betwixt the two Lo|vers, that the Neighbors began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething, and to rally the Scrivener, which did &s;o touch him, that he threatned both his Si&s;ters and the Eunuch to kill them, if they &s;hould continue their Commerce. And &s;oon after, finding them in the Night lying together, he &s;tabbed the Eunuch out-right, and left his Si&s;ter for dead. The whole <HI>Seraglio,</HI> Women and Eunuchs, made a League together again&s;t him to make him away; but <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> di&s;&s;ipated all the&s;e machinations, and was content to have him turn <HI>Mahumetan.</HI> Mean time 'tis thought, he cannot long avoid the malice and power of the Eunuchs; for 'tis not, as is the common &s;aying, with Men as with Brutes; the&s;e latter become gentler and more tractable when they are ca&s;trated; but men more vi|cious, and commonly very in&s;olent, though &s;ometimes it turneth to an admirable Fi|delity and Gallantry.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o about the &s;ame time, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was &s;omewhat di&s;contented with <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was &s;u&s;pected to have given Acce&s;s to two young Gallants into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> who were di&s;cover'd, and brought before <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Yet this being but a &s;u&s;picion, he expre&s;&s;ed to her no great re&s;entment of it; nor did he make u&s;e of &s;o great rigor and cruelty again&s;t tho&s;e poor men, as <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had done again&s;t the per&s;on above &s;poken of. The matter was related to me by an old <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Woman (that had a long while been Slave to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and went out and in at plea&s;ure) as followeth: She told me that <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> after &s;he had drawn from a young man, hidden by her, all his Ability, deliver'd him to &s;ome Wo|men, to convey him away in the Night thorough &s;ome Gardens, and &s;o to &s;ave him: But whether they were di&s;cover'd, or whether they feared they &s;hould be &s;o, or what el&s;e might be the cau&s;e, they fled, and left him there wandring in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Gardens, not knowing which way to get out: And being at la&s;t met with, and brought before <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who examined him &s;trictly, but could draw nothing el&s;e from him, than that he was come in over the walls, he was commanded to get out the &s;ame way by which he entred: But it &s;eems, the Eunuchs did more than <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had given order for, for they ca&s;t him down from the top of the walls to the bot|tom. As for the other young Gallant, this &s;ame Woman a&s;&s;ured me, that he was found wandring in the Garden like the fir&s;t; and having confe&s;&s;ed that he was come in by the Gate, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> commanded likewi&s;e, that he al&s;o &s;hould pa&s;s away again by the &s;ame Gate; yet re&s;erving to him&s;elf a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement for the Eunuchs,

&s;ince not only the honour of the Royal Hou&s;e, but al&s;o the &s;afety of the King's per|&s;on is herein concerned.</P>
<P>Some months after, there arrived at <HI>Dehli</HI> &s;everal Amba&s;&s;adors, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time. The fir&s;t was <HI>Xerif</HI> of <HI>Meccha,</HI> who&s;e Pre&s;ent did con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor|&s;es: The &s;econd and third Amba&s;&s;adors were, he of the King of <HI>Hyeman,</HI> or <HI>Happy Arabia,</HI> and he of the Prince of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> who likewi&s;e pre&s;ented <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;es. The two remaining Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent from the King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> To the three fir&s;t no great regard was given; they appear'd in &s;o mi&s;erable and confu&s;ed an Equipage, that it was perceived they came only to get &s;ome money by the means of their Pre&s;ent, and of the many Hor&s;es, and other Merchandize, which under the pretence of Amba&s;|&s;adors, entred without paying any Duty into the Kingdom, there to be &s;old, and to buy for the money a quantity of <HI>Indian</HI> Stuffs, and &s;o to return, without paying likewi&s;e any Impo&s;t at all.</P>
<P>But as to the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Emba&s;&s;y, that de&s;erves to be otherwi&s;e taken notice of; the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> having received the News of the Revolution of the <HI>Indies,</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;pread his Name in tho&s;e Parts, and there to make known his Grandeur and Magnificence, by a &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y: Or, as Malice will have it, or rather as the very truth is, to reap &s;ome Advantage by a Pre&s;ent as well as the re&s;t. Behold therefore this great Emba&s;&s;y! He cho&s;e for his Amba&s;&s;adors two per&s;ons, that one would think were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in his Court, and the mo&s;t capable to make &s;uch a De&s;ign pro&s;per. And who were they? The <HI>one</HI> was a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Merchant, whom I had &s;een &s;ome years ago at <HI>Moka,</HI> when I pa&s;&s;ed there coming out of <HI>Egypt</HI> over the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> where he was to &s;ell &s;ome Slaves for that Prince, and to buy of the money, rai&s;ed thence, &s;ome <HI>In|dian</HI> Commodities. And this is the fine Trade of that great <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King of <HI>Africa.</HI> The <HI>other</HI> was a Chri&s;tian Merchant of <HI>Armenia,</HI> born and married in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> known in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> by the name of <HI>Murat.</HI> I had &s;een him al&s;o at <HI>Moka,</HI> where he had ac|commodated me with the half of his Chamber, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with very good Ad|vice, whereof I have &s;poken in the beginning of this Hi&s;tory, as a thing taking me off from pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> according to my fir&s;t de&s;ign. He al&s;o came every year to that place, in that King's Name, for the &s;ame end that the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> did, and brought the Pre&s;ent which the King made every year, to the Gentlemen of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Company of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and carried away theirs. Now the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;utably to his de&s;ign, and the de&s;ire he had of making his Amba&s;&s;adors ap|pear with great Splendor, put him&s;elf to great Expences for this Emba&s;&s;ie: He gave them Thirty two young Slaves, of both Sexes, to &s;ell them at <HI>Moka,</HI> and thence to make a Sum of Money to bear their Charges. A wonderful Large&s;s! Slaves are com|monly &s;old there for Twenty five or thirty Crowns apiece, one with another. A con|&s;iderable Sum. Be&s;ides, he gave them for a Pre&s;ent to the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> Five and twen|ty choice Slaves, among which there were nine or ten very young, proper to make Eunuchs of. A very worthy Pre&s;ent for a King, and he a Chri&s;tian, to a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Prince! It &s;eems the Chri&s;tianity of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> is very different from ours. He added to that Pre&s;ent, twelve Hor&s;es, e&s;teem'd as much as tho&s;e of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and a kind of little Mule, of which I &s;aw the Skin, which was a very great Rarity, there being no Tyger &s;o hand&s;omly &s;peckled, nor Silken Stuff of <HI>India</HI> &s;o finely, &s;o variou&s;ly, and &s;o orderly &s;treaked, as that was. Moreover, there were for a part of the Pre&s;ent, two Elephants teeth, &s;o prodigious, that they a&s;&s;ured it was all that a very able bodied man could do, to lift up one of them from the ground. La&s;tly, an Horn of an Ox full of Civett, and &s;o big, that the Aperture of it being mea&s;ur'd by me, when it came to <HI>Dehli,</HI> it had a Diameter of Half a Foot, and &s;omewhat better. All things being thus prepared, the Amba&s;&s;adors depart from <HI>Gondez,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;ituated in the Province of <HI>Dambea,</HI> and came through a very trouble&s;om Countrey to <HI>Beiloul,</HI> which is a di&s;peopled Sea-Port over again&s;t <HI>Moka,</HI> nigh to <HI>Babel-mandel,</HI> not daring to come (for Rea&s;ons el&s;ewhere to be alledged) the ordinary way of the <HI>Caravans,</HI> which is made with ea&s;e in Forty days to <HI>Arkiko,</HI> and thence to pa&s;s to the I&s;le of <HI>Ma&s;oua.</HI> Du|ring their &s;tay at <HI>Beiloul,</HI> and expecting a Bark of <HI>Moka,</HI> to wa&s;t over the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> there died &s;ome of their Slaves, becau&s;e the Ve&s;&s;el tarried, and they found not in that place tho&s;e refre&s;hments that were nece&s;&s;ary for them. When they came to <HI>Moka,</HI> they &s;oon &s;old their Merchandize, to rai&s;e a Stock of Money according to order. But they had this ill luck, that that year the Slaves were very cheap, becau&s;e the Market was
<PB N="43" REF="356">
glutted by many other Merchants, yet they rai&s;ed a Sum to pur&s;ue their Voyage: They Embark'd upon an <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to pa&s;s to <HI>Suratte;</HI> their Pa&s;&s;age was pretty good; they were not above Five and twenty days at Sea; but whether it was that they had made no good provi&s;ion for want of &s;tock, or what el&s;e the cau&s;e might be, many of their Slaves and Hor&s;es, as al&s;o the Mule, whereof they &s;aved the Skin, died. They were no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Suratte,</HI> but a certain Rebel of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> called&punc;<HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> came and ran&s;acked and burned the Town, and in it their Hou&s;e, &s;o that they could &s;ave nothing but their Letters, &s;ome Slaves that were &s;ick, or which <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> could not light on, their <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Habits which he cared not for, and the Mule's Skin, and the Ox's Horn, which was already emptied of the Civett. They did very much exagge|rate their misfortune; but tho&s;e malicious <HI>Indians</HI> that had &s;een them arrive in &s;uch a wretched condition, without Provi&s;ions, without Habits, without Money, or Bills of Exchange, &s;aid, that they were very happy, and &s;hould reckon the Plunder of <HI>Suratte</HI> for a piece of their be&s;t Fortune, fora&s;much as <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> had &s;aved them the labour of bringing their mi&s;erable Pre&s;ent to <HI>Dehli,</HI> and had furni&s;ht them with a very &s;pecious pretence for their beggarly condition, and for the &s;ale they had made of their Civett, and of &s;ome of their Slaves, and for demanding of the Governor of <HI>Suratte</HI> Provi&s;i|ons for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as al&s;o &s;ome Money and Chariots to continue their Voyage to <HI>Dehli.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Adrican,</HI> chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, my Friend, had given to the <HI>Armenian Murat</HI> a Letter of Recommendation to me, which he deliver'd him&s;elf at <HI>Dehli,</HI> not remembring that I had been his Ho&s;t at <HI>Moka.</HI> It was a very plea&s;ant meet|ing when we came to know one another, after the &s;pace of five or &s;ix years. I em|braced him affectionately, and promi&s;ed him that I would &s;erve him in whatever I could; but that, though I had Acquaintance at the Court, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to do them any con&s;iderable good Office there: For &s;ince they had not brought with them any valuable Pre&s;ent, but only the Mule's Skin, and the empty Ox's Horn, and that they were &s;een going upon the &s;treets without any Paleky or Hor&s;es, &s;ave that of our Father Mi&s;&s;ionary, and mine (which they had almo&s;t killed) cloathed like Beg|gars, and followed with &s;even or eight Slaves, bare-headed and bare-foot, having no|thing but an ugly Shar&s;e tyed between their Legs, with a ragged Cloth over their Left Shoulder, pa&s;&s;ing under their Left Arm like a Summer-Cloak; &s;ince, I &s;aid, they were in &s;uch a po&s;ture, whatever I could &s;ay for them was in&s;ignificant; they were taken for Beggars, and no body took other notice of them. Yet notwith&s;tanding I &s;aid &s;o much of the Grandeur of their King to my <HI>Agah Danechmendkan,</HI> who had cau&s;e to hearken to me, as managing all Foreign Affairs there, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> gave them Audience, received their Letters, pre&s;ented them each with an Embroider'd Ve&s;t, a Silken Embroider'd Girdle, and a Turbant of the &s;ame, gave order for their Enter|tainment, and di&s;patched them in a little time, and that with more honour than there was ground to expect: For in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them, he pre&s;ented them each with another &s;uch Ve&s;t, and with 6000 <HI>Rupies</HI> for them all, which amounteth to about 3000 Crowns, of which the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> had four thou&s;and, and <HI>Murat,</HI> becau&s;e a Chri&s;tian, but two thou&s;and. He al&s;o gave them for a Pre&s;ent to their Ma&s;ter a very rich <HI>Ser-apah</HI> or Ve&s;t, two great &s;ilver and gilt Trumpets, two &s;ilver Tymbals, a Poynard cover'd with Jewels, and the value of about twenty thou&s;and Francs in golden and &s;ilver <HI>Rupies,</HI> to let their King &s;ee Money coined, as a Rarity he had not in his Countrey: But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> knew very well, that the&s;e <HI>Rupies</HI> would not go out of the Kingdom, and that they were like to buy Commodities for them: And it fell out &s;o; for they laid them out, partly in fine Cotton Cloth, to make &s;hirts of for their King, Queen, and their only lawful Son that is to be the Succe&s;&s;or; partly in &s;ilken Stuffs &s;treaked with Gold or Silver, to make Ve&s;ts and Summer-Drawers of; partly in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scarlet, to make two <HI>Arabian</HI> Ve&s;ts of for their King al&s;o; and la&s;tly, in Spices, and in &s;tore of coar&s;er Cloth, for divers Ladies of his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and for the Children he had by them, all with|out paying any Duty.</P>
<P>For all my friend&s;hip with <HI>Murat,</HI> there were three things that made me almo&s;t re|pent to have &s;erved them. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Murat</HI> having promi&s;ed me to leave with me for 50 <HI>Rupies,</HI> a little Son of his, that was very pretty, of a delicate black, and without &s;uch a &s;welled No&s;e, or &s;uch thick Lips as commonly the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> have, broke his word with me, and let me know, that he &s;hould take no le&s;s for him than 300 <HI>Rupies.</HI> For all this, I had thoughts of buying him, for Rarity's &s;ake, and that I
<PB N="44" REF="357">
might &s;ay, a Father had &s;old me his Son. The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> becau&s;e I found that <HI>Murat,</HI> as well as the <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> had obliged them&s;elves to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that they would em|ploy their intere&s;t with their King, that he might permit in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to rebuild an old <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> ruined in the time of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and which had been built for a Tomb of a great <HI>Dervich,</HI> which went from <HI>Mecha</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> for the propagation of <HI>Mahumeta|ni&s;m,</HI> and there made great progre&s;s. They receiv'd of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> two thou&s;and <HI>Ru|pies</HI> for this Engagement. This <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI> had been pulled down by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> when they came with their Succors into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which the then King, who turn'd Catho|lick, had asked of them again&s;t a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Prince, invading his Kingdom.

<P>During the time that the Amba&s;&s;adors were at <HI>Dehli,</HI> my <HI>Agah,</HI> who is more than ordinary curious, made them often come to him, when I was pre&s;ent, to inform him|&s;elf of the State and Government of their Countrey, and principally to learn &s;omething of the &s;ource of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which they call <HI>Ababile,</HI> of which they di&s;cour&s;ed to us as a thing &s;o well known, that no body doubted of it. <HI>Murat</HI> him&s;elf, and a <HI>Mogol,</HI> who was returned out of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with him, had been there, and told us very near the &s;ame Particulars with tho&s;e I had received of it at <HI>Moka, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Nile</HI> had its Origine in the Countrey of <HI>Agam;</HI> that it i&s;&s;ued out of the Earth by two Springs bubling up, near to one another, which did form a little Lake of about thirty or forty paces long; that coming out of this Lake, it did make a con&s;iderable River: and that from &s;pace to &s;pace, it receiv'd &s;mall Rivers increa&s;ing it. They added, that it went on circling, and making as 'twere a great I&s;le; and that afterwards it tumbled down from &s;teep Rocks into a great Lake, in which there were divers fruitful I&s;les, &s;tore of Crocodiles, and (which would be remarkable enough, if true) abundance of Sea-Calves, that have no other vent for their Excrements than that, by which they take in their food; this Lake being in the Countrey of <HI>Dambea,</HI> three &s;mall days journey from <HI>Gondar,</HI> and four or five days journey from the &s;ource of the <HI>Nile.</HI> And la&s;tly, that this River did break out of this Lake, being augmented with many River-waters, and with &s;everal Torrents falling into it, e&s;pecially in the rainy Sea&s;on, (which do regularly begin there, as in the <HI>Indies</HI> about <HI>July,</HI> which is very con&s;iderable and convincing for the inunda|tion of the <HI>Nile)</HI> and &s;o runs away through <HI>Sonnar,</HI> the capital City of the King of <HI>Fungi,</HI> Tributary to the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and from thence pa&s;&s;eth to the Plains of <HI>Me&s;re,</HI> which is <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors were not wanting to &s;ay more than was liked on the &s;ubject of their King's Greatne&s;s, and of the &s;trength of his Army, but the <HI>Mogolian</HI> did not over-much agree with them in it; and in their ab&s;ence repre&s;ented to us this Army, which he had &s;een twice in the Field, with the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> King on the head of it, as the mo&s;t wretched thing in the world.</P>
<P>They al&s;o related to us divers Particulars of that Countrey, which I have put in my Journal, one day perhaps to be dige&s;ted and copied: In the mean time I &s;hall in&s;ert here three or four things which <HI>Murat</HI> told me, becau&s;e I e&s;teem them very extrava|gant for a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Kingdom. He &s;aid then, that there were few men in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> who be&s;ides their lawful Wife, had not many others, and him&s;elf owned that he had two, without reckoning her which he had left at <HI>Aleppo:</HI> That the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Women did not &s;o hide them&s;elves, as they do in the <HI>Indies</HI> among the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> nor even as among the <HI>Gentiles: That</HI> tho&s;e of the meaner &s;ort of People, Maids, or married Women, Slaves or Free, were often together pell-mell, night and day, in the &s;ame Chamber, without tho&s;e jealou&s;ies &s;o common in other Countries: That the Women of Lords did not &s;tick much to go into the hou&s;e of a &s;imple Cavalier, whom they knew to be a Man of Execution: <HI>That</HI> if I had gone into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> they would &s;oon have obliged me to marry, as they had done, a few years &s;ince, to a certain <HI>European,</HI> who
<PB N="45" REF="357">
named him&s;elf a <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;ician: <HI>That</HI> an ancient man, of about four&s;core years of age, did one day pre&s;ent to the King four&s;core Sons, all of age, and able to bear Arms; and that the King asked him, Whether he had no more but them? To whom having an&s;wer'd, No, but only &s;ome Daughters, the King &s;ent him away with this reproach; Be gone, thou Calf, and be a&s;hamed for having no more Children at that age, as if Women were wanting in my Dominions! <HI>That</HI> the King him&s;elf had at lea&s;t four&s;core Sons and Daughters running about pell-mell in the Seraglio, for whom he had cau&s;ed to be made a number of round verni&s;hed &s;ticks, made like a little maze; tho&s;e Chil|dren being fond of having that in their hand like a Scepter, di&s;tingui&s;hing them from tho&s;e that were Children of Slaves, or from others living in that place.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;ent al&s;o twice for the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that my <HI>Agah</HI> did, and e&s;pecially to enquire after the &s;tate of <HI>Mahumetani&s;m</HI> in that Country. He had al&s;o the curio&s;ity of Viewing the skin of the Mule, which remained, I know not how, in the Fortre&s;s among&s;t the Officers; which was to me a great mortifica|tion, becau&s;e they had de&s;igned it for me for the good &s;ervices I had done them. I made account to have one day pre&s;ented it to &s;ome very curious per&s;on in <HI>Europe.</HI> I urged often, that together with the Mules skin, they &s;hould carry the great Horn to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to &s;hew it him; but they fear'd, lea&s;t he &s;hould make a que&s;tion, which would have perplexed them; <HI>viz.</HI> how it came to pa&s;s, that they had &s;aved the Horn from the plunder of <HI>Suratte,</HI> and lo&s;t the Civet?</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> were at <HI>Dehli,</HI> it came to pa&s;s that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> called together his Privy Councel, and the mo&s;t learn'd per&s;ons of his Court, to chu&s;e a new Ma&s;ter for his third Son, <HI>Sultan Eckbar,</HI> whom he de&s;ign'd for his Suc|ce&s;&s;or. In this Councel he &s;hew'd the pa&s;&s;ion he hath to have this young Prince well Educated, and to make him a great Man. <HI>Aurenge-Zebe</HI> is not ignorant of what im|portance it is, and how much 'tis to be wi&s;hed, that as much as Kings &s;urmount o|thers in Greatne&s;s, they may al&s;o exceed them in Virtue and Knowledge. He al&s;o well knows, that one of the principal &s;ources of the Mi&s;ery, of the mi&s;-Government, of the un-Peopling, and the decay of the Empires of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> proceeds from thence, that the chil|dren of the Kings thereof are brought up only by Women and Eunuchs, which often are no other than wretched Slaves of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Circa&s;&s;ia, Mingrelia, Gurgi&s;tan</HI> and <HI>Ethio|pia;</HI> mean and &s;ervile, ignorant and in&s;olent &s;ouls. The&s;e Princes become Kings, when they are of Age, without being in&s;tructed, and without knowing what 'tis to be a King; amazed when they begin to come abroad out of the Seraglio, as per|&s;ons coming out of another World, or let out of &s;ome &s;ubterraneous Cave, where they had lived all their life time; wondring at every thing they meet, like &s;o many Innocents; believing all, and fearing all, like Children, or nothing at all, as if they were &s;tupid: And all this, according to their Nature, and &s;utable to the fir&s;t Images imprinted upon them; commonly high and proud, and &s;eemingly grave, but of that kind of pride and gravity, which is &s;o flat and di&s;ta&s;teful, and &s;o unbecoming them, than one may plainly &s;ee, 'tis nothing but brutality or barbarou&s;ne&s;s, and the effect of &s;ome ill-&s;tudied, and ill-dige&s;ted Documents; or el&s;e they fall into &s;ome childi&s;h civi|lities, yet more un&s;avoury; or into &s;uch cruelties, as are blind and brutal; or into that mean and gro&s;s vice of drunkenne&s;s, or into an exce&s;&s;ive and altogether unrea&s;on|able Luxury, either ruining their bodies and under&s;tandings with their Concubines, or altogether abandoning them&s;elves to the plea&s;ures of Hunting, like &s;ome carnive|rous Animals, preferring a pack of Dogs before the life of &s;o many poor people, whom they force to follow them in the pur&s;uit of their Game, and &s;uffer to peri&s;h of hunger, heat, cold, and mi&s;ery. In a word, they always run into &s;ome extreme or other, being altogether irrational and extravagant, according as they are carried by their na|tural temper, or by the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions that are given them; thus remaining, almo&s;t all, in a &s;trange ignorance of what concerns the &s;tate of the Kingdom; the reins of the Government being abandoned to &s;ome Vi&s;ir, who entertains them in their ignorance and in their pa&s;&s;ions, which are the two &s;tronge&s;t &s;upports he can have to rule always according to his own mind, with mo&s;t a&s;&s;urance, and the lea&s;t contradiction; and given over al&s;o to tho&s;e Slaves their Mothers, and to their Eunuchs, who often know nothing but to continue plots of cruelty, whereby they &s;trangle and bani&s;h one ano|ther, and &s;ometimes the Vi&s;irs, and even the Grand Signors them&s;elves; &s;o that no man what&s;oever, that hath any E&s;tate, can be in &s;afety of his life.</P>

But to return; after all the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors, which we have &s;poken of, there came at la&s;t news, that the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was upon the Frontiers. The <HI>Per&s;ian Omrahs,</HI> that are at the &s;ervice of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> &s;pred a rumor that he came for affairs of great importance; though intelligent per&s;ons much doubted of a Commi&s;&s;ion of that nature, con&s;idering that the time of great conjunctures was pa&s;&s;ed, and that tho&s;e <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and the other <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> did what they did, rather to make a &s;how, than for any thing el&s;e. Mean time, on the day of the Entry, this Amba&s;&s;ador was received with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect: The <HI>Bazars,</HI> through which he pa&s;&s;ed, were all new-paint|ed, and the Cavalry attending on the way for above the length of a whole League. Many <HI>Omrah's</HI> accompanied him with Mu&s;ick, Tymbals and Trumpets, and when he entred into the Fortre&s;s, or the Palace of the King, the Guns went off. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> received him with much civility, and was content he &s;hould make his Addre&s;s to him after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> mode, receiving al&s;o, without any &s;cruple, <HI>immediately</HI> from his hands the Letters of his King; which, out of re&s;pect, he lifted up even to his head, and after|wards read them with a grave and &s;erious countenance: Which done, he cau&s;ed an embroider'd Ve&s;t to be brought, together with a rich Turbant and Girdle, command|ing it to be put on him in his pre&s;ence. A little after, it was intimated to him, that he might order his Pre&s;ent to be brought in, which con&s;i&s;ted of five and twenty as hand|&s;ome Hor&s;es as ever I &s;aw, led, and cover'd with embroider'd trapings; and of twenty very &s;tately and lu&s;ty Camels, as big as Elephants: Moreover, of a good number of Boxes, &s;aid to be full of mo&s;t excellent Ro&s;e-water; and of a certain di&s;tilled water, very precious, and e&s;teemed highly cordial; be&s;ides, there were di&s;played five or &s;ix very rich and very large Tapi&s;&s;eries, and &s;ome embroider'd pieces exceeding noble, wrought in &s;mall flowers, &s;o fine and delicate, that I know not whether in all <HI>Europe</HI> any &s;uch can be met with. To all this were added four Damaskin'd Swords, with as many Poynards, all cover'd with Jewels; as al&s;o five or &s;ix Harna&s;&s;es of Hor&s;es, which were much e&s;teem'd, being al&s;o very fine and rich, the &s;tuff being rai&s;ed with rich Embroidery &s;et with &s;mall Pearls, and very fair Turcoi&s;es of the old Rock.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> beheld this Pre&s;ent very attentively; that he ad|mired the beauty and rarity of every piece, and that &s;everal times he extolled the Ge|nero&s;ity of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> a&s;&s;igning to the Amba&s;&s;ador a place among his chief <HI>Omrahs.</HI> And after he had entertained him a while with a di&s;cour&s;e about the incon|veniencies and hard&s;hips of his Voyage, he di&s;mi&s;t him, and made in&s;tance, that he &s;hould come every day to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>During the four or five Months that the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;taid at <HI>Dehli,</HI> he was always &s;plendidly treated at <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s charge; and the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs</HI> pre&s;ented him one after another; and at la&s;t he was very honourably di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: For <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had him apparelled with another rich <HI>Serapah</HI> or Ve&s;t, to which he added con&s;iderable pre&s;ents for him&s;elf, re&s;erving tho&s;e he intended for his King, 'till he &s;hould &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador expre&s;ly; which &s;ome time after he did.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e te&s;timonies of honour and re&s;pect which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had &s;hew'd to this Amba&s;&s;ador, the &s;ame <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> above &s;poken of, gave out, that their King had &s;en&s;ibly reproached him in his Letters, with the Death of <HI>Dara,</HI> and the Impri&s;onment of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> as actions unworthy of a Brother, and a Son, and a Mu&s;ulman; and that he had al&s;o hit him with the word <HI>Alem-Guire,</HI> or Conquerour of the World, which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had cau&s;ed to be engraven on his Coyn. But 'tis hard to believe, that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;hould do any &s;uch thing to provoke &s;uch a Vi|ctorious Prince, &s;ince <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is not in a condition to enter into a War with <HI>Indo&s;tan;</HI> I am rather apt to believe, that <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> hath work enough to keep <HI>Kandahar</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and the Frontiers on the &s;ide of <HI>Turky:</HI> Its Forces and Riches are known; it produceth not always &s;uch great Kings as the <HI>Chah-Abbas,</HI> Valiant, Intelligent, and Politick, knowing to make u&s;e of every thing, and to do much with &s;mall expences. If it were in a condition of undertaking any thing again&s;t <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> or really &s;en&s;ible of Piety and the Mu&s;al-Man Faith, why was it that in the&s;e la&s;t troubles and Civil Wars, which continued &s;o long in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;at &s;till and looked on, when <HI>Dara, Chan-Jehan, Sultan Sujah,</HI> and perhaps the Governour of <HI>Caboul</HI> de&s;ired their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and they might with no very great Army, nor great expences have &s;eized on the faire&s;t part of <HI>India,</HI> beginning from the Kingdom of <HI>Caboul,</HI> unto the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and beyond it, and &s;o made them&s;elves Umpires of all things? yet notwith|&s;tanding

<P>Mean while, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not &s;o much concern'd, nor troubled him&s;elf &s;o much with this Amba&s;&s;ador, as <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> upon a like occa&s;ion, did with him, that was &s;ent to him from the great <HI>Chah-Abbas.</HI> When the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are in the humor of Rallying again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> they relate the&s;e three or four little Stories of them: They &s;ay, That <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;eeing that the Court&s;hip and Promi&s;es made to their Am|ba&s;&s;ador were not able to prevail with him, &s;o as to make him perform his Salute after the <HI>Indian</HI> Mode, he devi&s;ed this Artifice; he commanded to &s;hut the great Gate of the Court of the <HI>Amkas,</HI> where he was to receive him, and to leave only open the Wicket, through which one man could not pa&s;s but very difficultly, by &s;tooping and holding down his Head, as the fa&s;hion is, when one maketh an <HI>Indian</HI> Reverence, to the end that it might be &s;aid, he had made the Amba&s;&s;ador put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture, which was &s;omething lower than the <HI>Indian Salam,</HI> or Salute; but that that Amba&s;&s;a|dor being aware of this trick, came in with his Back foremo&s;t: And that <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> out of indignation to &s;ee him&s;elf catch'd, told him, <HI>Eh Bed-bakt, Thou Wretch, do&s;t thou think thou come&s;t into a Stable of A&s;&s;es, &s;uch as thou art?</HI> And that the Amba&s;&s;ador, without any alteration, an&s;wer'd, <HI>Who would not think &s;o, &s;eeing &s;uch a little Door?</HI></P>
<P>Another &s;tory is this; That at a certain time <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> taking ill &s;ome coar&s;e and fierce An&s;wers return'd to him by the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, could not hold to tell him, <HI>What, hath</HI> Chah-Abbas <HI>no other men at his Court, that he mu&s;t &s;end to me &s;uch a Fool as thy &s;elf?</HI> And that the Amba&s;&s;ador an&s;wer'd, He hath many better and wi&s;er than me, but <HI>to &s;uch a King, &s;uch an Amba&s;&s;ador.</HI> They add, That on a certain day <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who had made the Amba&s;&s;ador to dine in his Pre&s;ence, and &s;ought &s;ome occa|&s;ion to affront him, &s;eeing that he was bu&s;ie in picking and gnawing of Bones, asked him &s;miling, <HI>Eh Eltchy-Gi,</HI> My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>What &s;hall the Dogs eat?</HI> And that he an&s;wer'd readily, <HI>Kichery,</HI> that is, a Di&s;h of Pul&s;e, which is the food of the meaner &s;ort of People, and which he &s;aw <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> eat, becau&s;e he loved it.</P>
<P>They &s;ay al&s;o, That <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> once asked him, <HI>What he thought of his new</HI> Dehli (which he was building) <HI>in compari&s;on of</HI> Hi&s;pahan? And that he an&s;wer'd aloud, and with an Oath, <HI>Billah, Billah, Hi&s;pahan doth not come near the du&s;t of Dehli;</HI> which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> took for a high Commendation, though the Amba&s;&s;ador mocked him, be|cau&s;e the du&s;t is &s;o trouble&s;om at <HI>Dehli.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, They relate that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> one day pre&s;&s;ing him to tell him, What he thought of the Grandeur of the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> compared to that of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>That, in his opinion, one could not better compare the Kings of</HI> In|dia <HI>than to a large Moon of</HI> 15 <HI>or</HI> 16 <HI>days old, and tho&s;e of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>to a &s;mall Moon of two or three days.</HI> And that this An&s;wer did at fir&s;t plea&s;e <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> but that &s;oon af|ter he perceived, that that Compari&s;on did him but little honour, the Amba&s;&s;ador's &s;ence being, that the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> were decrea&s;ing, and tho&s;e of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in|crea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e Points are &s;o commendable, and &s;uch marks of Wit, every one is free to judge, as he &s;eeth cau&s;e.

In the fir&s;t place you have taught me, that all that <HI>Frangi&s;tan (&s;o it &s;eems they call</HI> Europe) was nothing, but I know not what little I&s;land, of which the greate&s;t King was he of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and next to him he of <HI>Holland,</HI> and after him he of <HI>England;</HI> and as to the other Kings, as tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> you have repre&s;ented them to me as our petty <HI>Raja's;</HI> telling me, that the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> were far above them all together, and that they were the true and only <HI>Houma|jons,</HI> the <HI>Ekbars,</HI> the <HI>Jehan-Guyres,</HI> the <HI>Chah-Jehans,</HI> the <HI>Fortunate</HI> ones, the <HI>Great</HI> ones, the <HI>Conquerors</HI> and <HI>Kings of the World;</HI> and that <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Usbec, Kach|guer, Tartar</HI> and <HI>Catay, Pegu, China,</HI> and <HI>Matchina</HI> did tremble at the name of the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan:</HI> Admirable Geography&punc; You &s;hould rather have taught me exactly to di&s;tingui&s;h all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s;e different States of the world, and well to under&s;tand their &s;trength, their way of fighting, their Cu&s;toms, Religions, Governments and Intere&s;ts; and by the per|u&s;al of &s;olid Hi&s;tory, to ob&s;erve their Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, Decay, and whence, how, and by what accidents and errors, tho&s;e great Changes and Revolutions of Empires and Kingdoms have happened. I have &s;earee learnt of you the name of my Grand&s;ires, the famous Founders of this Empire; &s;o far were you from having taught me the Hi&s;tory of their Life, and what cour&s;e they took to make &s;uch great Conque&s;ts. You had a mind to teach me the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue, to read and to write, I am much obliged to you (for&s;ooth) for having made me lo&s;e &s;o much time upon a Language, that requires ten or twelve years to attain to its perfection; as if the Son of a King &s;hould think it to be an honour to him, to be a Grammarian, or &s;ome Doctor of the Law, and to learn other Languages than tho&s;e of his Neighbors, when he can|not well be without them; he, to whom Time is &s;o precious for &s;o many weighty things, which he ought by times to learn. As if there were any &s;pirit that did not with &s;ome reluctancy, and even with a kind of deba&s;ement, employ it &s;elf in &s;o &s;ad and dry an exerci&s;e, &s;o long &s;om and tedious, as is that of learning words.</P>
<P>Thus did <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> re&s;ent the pedantick In&s;tructions of his Tutor; to which 'tis affirmed in that Court, that after &s;ome Entertainment which he had with others, he further added the following Reproof.</P>
<P><Q>Know you not, that Childhood well govern'd, being a &s;tate which is ordinarily accompanied with an happy memory, is capable of thou&s;ands of good Precepts and In&s;tructions, which remain deeply impre&s;&s;ed the whole remainder of a man's life, and keep the mind always rai&s;ed for great Actions? The Law, Prayers, and Sciences, may they not as well be learned in our Mother-Tongue, as in <HI>Arabick?</HI> You told my Fa|ther <HI>Ghah-Jehan,</HI> that you would teach me Philo&s;ophy. 'Tis true, I remember very well, that you have entertain'd me for many years with airy que&s;tions, of things that afford no &s;atisfaction at all to the mind, and are of no u&s;e in humane Society, empty Notions, and meer Phancies, that have only this in them, that they are very hard to under&s;tand, and very ea&s;ie to forget, which are only capable to tire and &s;poil a good under&s;tanding, and to breed an Opinion that is in&s;upportable. I &s;till remember, that after you had thus amu&s;ed me, I know not how long, with your fine Philo&s;ophy, all I retained of it, was a multitude of barbarous and dark words, proper to bewilder,
<PB N="49" REF="359">
perplex, and tire out the be&s;t Wits, and only invented, the better to cover the vani|ty and ignorance of men like your &s;elf, that would make us believe, that they know all, and that under tho&s;e ob&s;cure and ambiguous words, are hid great my&s;teries, which they alone are capable to under&s;tand: If you had &s;ea&s;on'd me with that Philo&s;ophy, which formeth the mind to ratiocination, and in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;toms it to be &s;atisfied with nothing but &s;olid Rea&s;ons; if you had given me tho&s;e excellent Precepts and Doctrines, which rai&s;e the Soul above the A&s;&s;aults of Fortune, and reduce her to an un&s;hakeable and always equal temper, and permit her not to be lifted up by Pro&s;peri|ty, nor deba&s;ed by Adver&s;ity; if you had taken care to give me the knowledge of what we are, and what are the fir&s;t principles of things; and had a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in form|ing in my mind a fit <HI>Idea</HI> of the greatne&s;s of the Univer&s;e, and of the admirable order and motion of the parts thereof; if, I &s;ay, you had in&s;tilled into me this kind of Philo&s;ophy, I &s;hould think my &s;elf incomparably more obliged to you, than <HI>Alex|ander</HI> was to his <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> and believe it my duty to recompence you otherwi&s;e, than he did him. Should not you, in&s;tead of your flattery, have taught me &s;omewhat of that point &s;o important to a King, which is, what the reciprocal duties are of a So|vereign to his Subjects, and tho&s;e of Subjects to their Sovereign? And ought not you to have con&s;ider'd, that one day I &s;hould be obliged with the Sword to di&s;pute my Life and the Crown with my Brothers? Is not that the de&s;tiny almo&s;t of all the Sons of <HI>Indo&s;tan?</HI> Have you ever taken any care to make me learn, what 'tis to be&s;iege a Town, or to &s;et an Army in Array? For the&s;e things I am obliged to others, not at all to you. Go, and retire to the Village whence you are come, and let no body know who you are, or what is become of you.</Q></P>
<P>At that time there aro&s;e a kind of Tempe&s;t again&s;t <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> which did not di&s;|plea&s;e me. Mo&s;t people of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are &s;o infatuated by <HI>Judiciary A&s;trology,</HI> that they believe there is nothing done here below, but 'tis written above &punc;for &s;o they &s;peak.) In all their Undertakings therefore they con&s;ult A&s;trologers. When two Armies are ready to give Battel, they beware of falling on, till the A&s;trologer hath taken and de|termined the moment he fancies propitious for the beginning of the Combat. And &s;o, when the matter is about electing a Captain-General of an Army, of di&s;patching an Amba&s;&s;ador, of concluding a Marriage, of beginning a Voyage, and of doing any other thing, as buying a Slave, putting on new Apparel, &amp;c. nothing of all that is done, without the &s;entence of <HI>Mr. Star-Gazer;</HI> which is an incredible vexation, and a cu&s;tom drawing after it &s;uch important con&s;equences, that I know not how it can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t &s;o long: For the A&s;trologer mu&s;t needs have knowledge of all that pa&s;&s;eth, and of all that is undertaken, from the greate&s;t Affairs to the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>But behold, it happen'd, that the prime A&s;trologer of the King was drown'd, which occa&s;ioned a great noi&s;e at Court, and was a great di&s;credit to A&s;trology: For he be|ing the per&s;on that determined the moments of all Enterprizes and Actions for the King, and the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> every one wondred, how a man &s;o experienced, and that for &s;o long time had di&s;pen&s;ed good Adventures to others, could not fore&s;ee his own mi&s;|fortune&punc; There were not wanting tho&s;e, who pretended to be wi&s;er than others, and &s;aid, that in <HI>Frangi&s;tan,</HI> where Sciences did flouri&s;h, the Grandees do &s;u&s;pect all &s;uch kind of people, and that &s;ome hold them even no better than Mountebanks, that 'tis much doubted, whether this knowledge is grounded upon good and &s;olid rea&s;ons, and that it may very well be &s;ome fancy of A&s;trologers, or rather an Artifice to make them|&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary to the great ones, and to make them in &s;ome mea&s;ure to depend on them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es very much di&s;plea&s;ed the A&s;trologers; but nothing angred them &s;o much as this Story, become very famous, <HI>viz.</HI> That the great <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> King of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> commanded to be digged and prepared a little place in his <HI>Seraglio</HI> to make a Gar|den; that the young Trees were all ready, and that the Gardener made account to plant them the next day. Mean time the A&s;trologer taking upon him, &s;aid, <HI>That a good nick of time was to be ob&s;erved for planting them, to make them pro&s;per. Chah-Abas</HI> being content it &s;hould be &s;o, the <HI>Star Gazer</HI> took his In&s;truments, turned over his Books, made his Calculation, and concluded, <HI>That by rea&s;on of &s;uch and &s;uch a Conjunction and A&s;pect of the Planets, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be &s;et pre&s;ently.</HI> The Ma&s;ter-Gardener, who minded nothing le&s;s than this A&s;trologer, was not then at hand; yet for all that, they fell to work immediately, making holes, and planting the Trees, <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> him|&s;elf &s;etting them, that it might be &s;aid, that they were Trees &s;et with <HI>Chah-Abas</HI>'s own hands. The Gardener returning at Night, was &s;ufficiently amazed when he &s;aw
<PB N="50" REF="360">
the work done; and finding that the right place and order de&s;igned by him, was not taken; that, for Example, an Apricock-Tree &s;tood where an Apple-Tree &s;hould &s;tand, and a Pear-Tree where an Almond-Tree; being heartily angry with the A&s;trologer, cau&s;ed all the Trees to be plucked up again, and laid them down, with &s;ome Earth about them, for next morning, the time cho&s;en by him&s;elf. The News hereof came &s;oon to the Ears of the A&s;trologer, who pre&s;ently told <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> of it: He forthwith &s;ent for the Gardner and with &s;ome indignation asked him, <HI>What had made him &s;o bold, as to pull up tho&s;e Young Trees he had planted with his own hand? That the time had been &s;o exactly taken for them, that &s;o good an one would never be had again; aud that &s;o be had marred all.</HI> The rude Gardener, who had a Cup of <HI>Chiras</HI>-Wine in his head, look'd a&s;ide upon the A&s;trologer, and grumbling and &s;wearing, &s;aid to him the&s;e words, <HI>Billah, Billah, that mu&s;t needs be an admirable point of time which thou ha&s;t taken for the&s;e Trees, &V;nhappy A&s;trologer! They were planted this day Noon, and this Evening they have been plucked up again.</HI> When <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> heard this, he fell a laughing, turned his back upon the A&s;trologer, and went away.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add two Particulars, though hapned in the time of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> becau&s;e &s;uch things fall out often enough, and do withall give occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that ancient and barbarous cu&s;tom, which makes the Kings of <HI>India</HI> Heirs of the Goods of tho&s;e that die in their Service. The fir&s;t was of <HI>Neiknam-kan,</HI> one of the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Om|rahs</HI> of the Court, and who for the &s;pace of 40 or 50 years, wherein he had always been employ'd in con&s;iderable Offices, had heaped up great &s;tore of Gold and Silver. This Lord &s;eeing him&s;elf near his End, and thinking upon this unrea&s;onable cu&s;tom, which often renders the Wife of a great Man, upon his decea&s;e, poor and mi&s;erable in an in&s;tant, and nece&s;&s;itates her to pre&s;ent a Petition, begging &s;ome &s;mall Pen&s;ion for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and for that of her Children, who are con&s;trained to li&s;t them&s;elves for common Soldiers under &s;ome <HI>Omrah,</HI> who, I &s;ay, con&s;idering this with him&s;elf, &s;ecretly di&s;tributed all his Trea&s;ure to indigent Knights, and poor Widows, filled his Trunks with old pieces of Iron, old Shoes, Rags and Bones, and locked and &s;ealed them, telling every body that they were Goods belonging to <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> the King. The&s;e Trunks, after his death, were brought before <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> when he was in the A&s;&s;embly, and by his command in&s;tantly opened in the pre&s;ence of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that &s;aw all this fine Stuff, which &s;o provoked and di&s;compo&s;ed <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that he ro&s;e in great fury, and went away.</P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> is only a piece of Gallantry. A rich <HI>Banean,</HI> or Heathen Merchant, being a great U&s;urer, (as mo&s;t of them are) who had always been in Employment, and in the Pay of the King, came to dye. Some years after his death, his Son did extremely importune the Widow, his Mother, to let him have &s;ome Money: She finding him to be a prodigal and debauched Youth, gave him as little as &s;he could. This young Fool, by the per&s;wa&s;ion of others like him&s;elf, made his Complaints to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and was &s;o &s;illy, as to di&s;cover to him all the Goods his Father had left, which amounted to Two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Rupies,</HI> or Hundred thou&s;and Crowns. <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who &s;oon got an itch for this Trea&s;ure, &s;ent for the Widow, and commanded her in the open A&s;&s;embly to &s;end him an Hundred thou&s;and <HI>Rupies,</HI> and to give Fifty thou&s;and to her Son, giving order at the &s;ame time to put her away. The old Woman, though &s;urprized at this Command, and perplext enough, that &s;he was &s;o &s;uddenly thru&s;t out, without the liberty of &s;peaking, yet lo&s;t not her judgment, but with a loud voice gave out, That &s;he had &s;omething of moment to di&s;cover to his Maje&s;ty: Whereupon be|ing brought in again, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>God &s;ave your Maje&s;ty; I find that my Son bath &s;ome rea|&s;on to demand of me the Goods of his Father, as being of his and my fle&s;h and blood, and therefore our Heir; but I would gladly know, what Kindred your Maje&s;ty is to my decea&s;ed Husband, to be his Heir.</HI> When <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> heard &s;o plain a piece of Rallery, and a di&s;cour&s;e of Parentage of the King of the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a <HI>She-Banian,</HI> or Idolatrous She-Merchant, he could not hold laughing, and commanded &s;he &s;hould be gone, and that nothing &s;hould be asked of her.</P>
<P>But to return, I &s;hall not relate all the other con&s;iderable things that have happened &s;ince the end of the War, that is, &s;ince 1660. unto my departure, which was above &s;ix years after; though doubtle&s;s that would tend much to the de&s;ign I had in relating the other Particulars, which is, to make known the Genius and Temper of the <HI>Mogols</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> This I may do in another place: Here I &s;hall only give an Account of five or &s;ix Particulars, which tho&s;e that &s;hall have read this Relation, will doubtle&s;s be curious of.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="360">
The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that though <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Father, to be kept in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra</HI> with all imaginable care and caution; yet notwith&s;tanding he &s;till left him in his old Apartment with <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> his elde&s;t Daughter, his other Women, Singers, Dancers, Cooks, and others, nothing of that kind was wanting to him. There were al&s;o certain <HI>Mullahs,</HI> that were permitted to come and to read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to him (for he was become very devout.) And when he thought fit, there were brought before him brave Hor&s;es, and tamed <HI>Gazelles</HI> (which is a kind of Goat) to make them fight with one another; as al&s;o divers &s;orts of Birds of Prey, and &s;everal other rare Animals, to divert him as formerly. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf u&s;ed an Art to over|come at la&s;t his fiercene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy, which he had hitherto kept, though a Pri|&s;oner. And this was the effect of the obliging Letters, full of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which he often wrote to his Father, con&s;ulting him often as his Oracle, and expre&s;&s;ing a thou&s;and cares for him; &s;ending him al&s;o unce&s;&s;antly &s;ome pretty Pre&s;ent or other, whereby <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was &s;o much gained, that he al&s;o wrote very often to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> touching the Government and State Affairs, and of his own Accord &s;ent him &s;ome of tho&s;e Jewels, which before he had told him of, that Hammers were ready to beat them to Powder the fir&s;t time he &s;hould again ask for them. Be&s;ides, he con&s;ented that the Daughter of <HI>Dara,</HI> which he had &s;o peremptorily denied, &s;hould be deliver'd to him; and granted him at length that pardon and paternal ble&s;&s;ing which he had &s;o often de&s;ired without obtaining it. Yet, under all this, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> did not always flat|ter him; on the contrary, he &s;ometimes return'd &s;harp An&s;wers, when he met with &s;trains in his Fathers Letters that were pregnant, or expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething of his former height and authority. Of this we may judge by the Letter, which I know from a very good hand was once written to him by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to this effect:</P>
<P>Sir, You would have me indi&s;pen&s;ably follow tho&s;e ancient Cu&s;toms, and make my &s;elf Heir to all tho&s;e that are in my Pay with the wonted rigor: An Omrah, and even a Merchant can no &s;ooner dye, and &s;ometimes even before his death, but we &s;eal up his Trunks, and &s;eize on his Goods, and make a &s;trict enquiry into his E&s;tate, impri&s;oning and ill-treating the Officers of the Hou&s;e to di&s;cover to us all he hath, even to the lea&s;t Jewels. I will believe that there is &s;ome policy in doing &s;o, but it cannot be denied, that 'tis very rigorous, and &s;ometimes very unju&s;t, and to &s;peak the very truth, we may de&s;erve well enough, that the &s;ame &s;hould befall us every day, what hapned to you from your <HI>Neikman-kan,</HI> and from the Widow of your rich <HI>Indian</HI> Merchant. Moreover <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> it &s;eems, I am by you reputed proud and haughty now I am King: As if you knew not by the experience of more than Forty years of your Reign, how heavy an Ornament a Crown is, and how many &s;ad and re&s;tle&s;s Nights it pa&s;&s;eth through: as if I could forget that excellent pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Mir-Timur,</HI> (commonly called <HI>Tamberlan)</HI> which is &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly delivered to us by that great Grandfather of ours, <HI>Ekbar,</HI> to the end that we might the more weigh the importance and value of it, and con&s;ider, whether we have cau&s;e to pride our &s;elves &s;o much in a Crown. You well know, that he &s;aid, that the &s;ame day when <HI>Timur</HI> took <HI>Bajazet,</HI> he made him come before him, and having fixed his eyes on him, fell a laughing; at which <HI>Bajazet</HI> being highly offended, fiercely &s;aid to him, <HI>Laugh not at my Fortune,</HI> Timur; <HI>know that 'tis God that is the Di&s;pen&s;er of Kingdoms and Empires; and that the &s;ame can befall you to morrow, that hath befallen me to day.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Timur</HI> made this &s;erious and brave An&s;wer, <HI>I know as well as you,</HI> Bajazet, <HI>that 'tis God that di&s;tributeth Kingdoms and Empires; I laugh not at your ill Fortune, God forbid I &s;hould do &s;o: But beholding your face, I &s;miled, and had this thought, That certainly the&s;e Kingdoms and Empires mu&s;t in them&s;elves be very little and contemptible things in the eyes of God, &s;ince he giveth them to per&s;ons &s;o ill made as you and I both are; a deformed one-ey'd man, as you; and a lame wretch, as my &s;elf.</HI> You require al&s;o, that abandoning all my other Employments, which I believe very nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and happine&s;s of this State, I &s;hould think on nothing but Conque&s;ts, and the enlargement of the Empire. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this is indeed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a great Monarch, and of a Soul truly Royal, and that I &s;hould not de&s;erve to be of the Blood of the Great <HI>Timur,</HI> if I were not of that mind, and had not &s;uch inclinations. Mean time, I think I &s;it not idle, and my Ar|mies are not u&s;ele&s;s in the Kingdoms of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Bengale:</HI> But we mu&s;t al&s;o aver, that the greate&s;t Conquerors are not always the greate&s;t Kings; that we too often &s;ee a <HI>Barbarian</HI> ma|king Conque&s;ts, and that tho&s;e great Bodies of Conque&s;ts do ordinarily fall of them&s;elves, and by their own weight. He is a great King, that knows to acquit him&s;elf worthily of that Great and Augu&s;t Employment and Charge of Kings, which is to di&s;pen&s;e Ju&s;tice to their Sub|jects, &amp;c. <HI>The re&s;t is not come to my hands.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Emir</HI> &s;oon perceived, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had skilfully put by the &s;troke, that it would be in vain the &s;econd time to ask of him his Son; that he could not do it with|out offending him; and that therefore the &s;afe&s;t way would be to re&s;t contented with all the te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip, and with all the Honours, together with the Go|vernment of <HI>Bengale;</HI> being in the mean time always upon his guard, and in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that &s;ince he could attempt nothing again&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe, Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould not be able to attempt any thing again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the&s;e two Great Men carry them&s;elves to one another: And in this condition did affairs remain for almo&s;t a year; till <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> too well know|ing that a great Captain cannot be long at re&s;t, and that, if he be not employed in a Foreign War, he will at length rai&s;e a Dome&s;tick one; propo&s;ed to him to make War upon that rich and potent Raja of <HI>Acham,</HI> who&s;e Territories are on the North of <HI>Dake,</HI> upon the Gulf of <HI>Bengale.</HI> The <HI>Emir,</HI> who in all appearance had already de|&s;igned this &s;ame thing of him&s;elf, and who believed, that the Conque&s;t of this Coun|try, would make way for his Immortal Honour, and be an occa&s;ion of carrying his Arms as far as <HI>China,</HI> declared him&s;elf ready for this Enterprize. He embarked at <HI>Dake</HI> with a pui&s;&s;ant Army, upon a River which comes from tho&s;e parts; upon which having gone about an hundred Leagues North-Ea&s;tward, he arrived at a Ca&s;tle cal|led <HI>Azo,</HI> which the Raja of <HI>Acham</HI> had u&s;urped from the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for many years. He attacked this place, and took it by force in le&s;s than fifteen days; thence marching over Land towards <HI>Chamdara,</HI> which is the Inlet into the Country of that Raja; he entred into it after 26 days journey, &s;till Northward: There a Battel was fought, in which the Raja of <HI>Acham</HI> was wor&s;ted, and obliged to retreat to <HI>Guerguon,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of his Kingdom, four miles di&s;tant from <HI>Chamdara.</HI> The <HI>Emir</HI> pur&s;ued him &s;o clo&s;e, that he gave him no time to fortifie him&s;elf in <HI>Guer|guon:</HI> For he arrived in &s;ight of that Town in five days, which con&s;trained the <HI>Raja,</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Emir</HI>'s Army, to fly towards the Mountains of the Kingdom of <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> and to abandon <HI>Guerguon,</HI> which was pillaged, as had been <HI>Chamdara.</HI> They found there va&s;t riches, it being a great, very fair and Merchant-like Town, and where the Wo|men are extraordinarily beautiful. Mean time, the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains came in
<PB N="53" REF="361">
&s;ooner than u&s;ually; and they being exce&s;&s;ive in tho&s;e parts, and overflowing all the Countrey, except &s;uch Villages as &s;tand on rai&s;ed ground, the <HI>Emir</HI> was much em|bara&s;&s;ed. For the <HI>Raja</HI> made his people of the Mountains come down from all parts thereabout, and to carry away all the provi&s;ions of the Field; whereby the <HI>Emir</HI>'s Ar|my (as rich as 'twas) before the end of the rains fell into great &s;treights, without being able to go forward or backward. It could not advance, by rea&s;on of the Moun|tains very difficult to pa&s;s, and continually pe&s;ter'd with great Rains; nor retreat, be|cau&s;e of the like Rains and deep wayes; the <HI>Raja</HI> al&s;o having cau&s;ed the way to be digged up as far as to <HI>Chamdara:</HI> So that the <HI>Emir</HI> was forced to remain in that wretched condition during the whole time of the Rain; after which, when he found his Army di&s;ta&s;ted, tired out, and half &s;tarved, he was nece&s;&s;itated to give over the De&s;ign he had of advancing, and to return the &s;ame way he was come. But this Re|treat was made with &s;o much pains, and &s;o great inconveniencies, by rea&s;on of the dirt, the want of Victuals, and the pur&s;uit of the <HI>Raja</HI> falling on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, that every body (but he) that had not known how to remedy the di&s;order of &s;uch a March, nor had the patience to be &s;ometimes five or &s;ix hours at one pa&s;&s;age to make the Soul|diery get over it without confu&s;ion, would have utterly peri&s;h'd, him&s;elf, Army, and all; yet he, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e difficulties and ob&s;tacles, made a &s;hift to come back with great honour and va&s;t riches. He de&s;ign'd to return thither again the next year, and to pur&s;ue his undertaking, &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Azo,</HI> which he had fortified, and where he left a &s;trong Garri&s;on, would be able to hold out the re&s;t of the year again&s;t the <HI>Raja.</HI> But he was no &s;ooner arrived there, but Fluxes began to rage in his Army: Neither had him&s;elf a body of Steel more than the re&s;t; he fell &s;ick and died, whereby Fortune ended the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> I &s;ay, the <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> appre|hen&s;ions; for there was none of tho&s;e that knew this great man, and the &s;tate of the affairs of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> who did not &s;ay, 'Tis this day that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is King of <HI>Bengale.</HI> And him&s;elf could not forbear to expre&s;s &s;ome &s;uch thing; for he publickly &s;aid to <HI>Mahmet-Emir-kan;</HI> You have lo&s;t your Father, and I the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t dan|gerous Friend I had; yet notwith&s;tanding he comforted this Son, and withal a&s;&s;ured him, that he would ever be a Father to him. And whereas 'twas thought, that he would at lea&s;t cut off his Salary, and make Inqui&s;ition into his Trea&s;ury, he confirmed him in his Office of <HI>Bakchis,</HI> augmented his Pen&s;ion to a thou&s;and Rupies a month, and left him Heir of all the E&s;tate of his Father, although the Cu&s;tom of the Country empower'd him to &s;eize on all.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> is concerning <HI>Chah-be&s;t-kan,</HI> whom <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made fir&s;t Governour of <HI>Agra,</HI> when he went out to the Battel of <HI>Kadjoue</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> and after|ward, Governour and General of the Army in <HI>Decan;</HI> and at la&s;t, after the death of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> Governour and General of the Army in <HI>Bengale,</HI> together with the charge of <HI>Mirul Omrah</HI> which <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. This <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> is he, whom in our Hi&s;tory we have mention'd as Uncle to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and one that hath &s;o much contributed to his happine&s;s by his eloquent and skilful pen, as well as by his intrigues and coun&s;els. It would be injurious to his Renown al&s;o, to be &s;ilent of the important enterpri&s;e, which he undertook pre&s;ently when he entred upon his Government; and that the rather, becau&s;e <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> whether out of Policy, or for another cau&s;e, had no mind to tempt him; as al&s;o, becau&s;e the particularities, which I am going to relate, will &s;hew not only the pa&s;&s;ed and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Kingdoms of <HI>Bengale</HI> and <HI>Rakan,</HI> which hitherto hath not been well de&s;cribed to us by any; but al&s;o &s;ome other things that are worth knowing.</P>
<P>To the end therefore that the importance of <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI>'s attempt may be well under&s;tood, and a good Idea be had of what pa&s;&s;eth about the Gulf of <HI>Bengale,</HI> we are to know, that the&s;e many years there have always been in the Kingdom of <HI>Rakan</HI> or <HI>Moy,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> and with them a great number of their <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slaves, and other <HI>Franguis,</HI> gather'd from all parts. <HI>That</HI> was the refuge of the Run-aways from <HI>Goa, Ceilan, Cochin, Malague,</HI> and all tho&s;e other places, which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> formerly held in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and they were &s;uch as had abandoned their Mona&s;teries, men that had been twice or thrice Married, Murtherers: In a word, &s;uch as had de|&s;erved the Rope, were mo&s;t welcome and mo&s;t e&s;teem'd there, leading in that Coun|try a life that was very dete&s;table, and altogether unworthy of Chri&s;tians, in&s;o|much that they impunely butchered and poi&s;oned one another, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated their
<PB N="54" REF="362">
own Prie&s;ts, who &s;ometimes were not better than them&s;elves. The King of <HI>Rakan</HI> in the apprehen&s;ion he hath ever had of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> kept them for a guard of his Fron|tiers, in a Port-Town called <HI>Chategon,</HI> giving them Land, and liberty to live as they plea&s;ed. Their ordinary Trade was Robbery and Piracy. With &s;ome &s;mall and light Gallies they did nothing but coa&s;t about that Sea, and entring into all Rivers there|about, and into the Channels and Arms of <HI>Ganges,</HI> and between all tho&s;e I&s;les of the lower <HI>Bengale,</HI> and often penetrating even &s;o far as fourty or fifty leagues up into the Country, &s;urprized and carried away whole Towns, A&s;&s;emblies, Markets, Fea&s;ts and Weddings of the poor Gentiles, and others of that Country, making Women Slaves, great and &s;mall, with &s;trange cruelty; and burning all they could not carry away. And thence it is, that at pre&s;ent there are &s;een in the mouth of <HI>Ganges</HI> &s;o many fine I&s;les quite de&s;erted, which were formerly well peopled, and where no other Inhabi|tants are found but wild Bea&s;ts, and e&s;pecially Tygers.</P>
<P>This great number of Slaves, which thus they took from all quarters, behold what u&s;e they made of. They had boldne&s;s and impudence enough, to come and fell to that very Country the old people, which they knew not what to do with; where it &s;o fell out, that tho&s;e who had e&s;caped the danger by flight, and by hiding them&s;elves in the Woods, labour'd to redeem to day their Fathers and Mothers, that had been taken ye&s;terday. The re&s;t they kept for their &s;ervice to make Rowers of them; and &s;uch Chri&s;tians as they were them&s;elves, bringing them up to robbing and killing; or el&s;e they &s;old them to the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> of <HI>Goa, Ceilan,</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and others, and even to tho&s;e that were remaining in <HI>Bengale</HI> at <HI>Ogouli,</HI> who were come thither to &s;ettle them|&s;elves there by the favour of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> the Grandfather of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who &s;uffered them there upon the account of Traffick, and of his having no aver&s;ion to Chri&s;tians, as al&s;o becau&s;e they promi&s;ed him to keep the Bay of <HI>Bengale</HI> clear from all Pyrates. And it was towards the I&s;le of <HI>Galles,</HI> near the Cape of <HI>Palmes,</HI> where this fine Trade was. The&s;e Pyrates lay there in wait at the pa&s;&s;age for the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who filled their Ships with them at a very ea&s;ie rate; this infamous Rabble impu|dently bragging, that they made more Chri&s;tians in one year, than all the Mi&s;&s;io|naries of the <HI>Indies</HI> in ten; which would be a &s;trange way of enlarging Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Pyrates that made <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who was a more zealous <HI>Mahume|tan</HI> than his Father <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> to expre&s;s at la&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion, not only again&s;t the Reverend Fathers the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>Agra,</HI> in that he cau&s;ed to be pulled down the be&s;t part of a very fair and large Church that had been built, as well as that of <HI>Lahor,</HI> by the favour of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> who as I &s;aid, did not hate Chri&s;tiani|ty; and upon which there &s;tood a great Steeple with a great Bell in it, who&s;e &s;ound might be heard over all the Town, not only, I &s;ay, again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> but al&s;o again&s;t the Chri&s;tians of <HI>Ogouli:</HI> For being impatient to &s;ee them connive at the Pyrates, to make the name of the <HI>Franguis</HI> formidable, and to fill their hou&s;es with Slaves that were his own Subjects, he wa&s;ted and utterly ruined them, after he had both with fair words and menaces drawn from them as much money as he could: And becau&s;e they were indi&s;creetly ob&s;tinate, in refu&s;ing what he demanded of them, he be&s;ieged them, and cau&s;ed them all to be brought to <HI>Agra,</HI> even their very Chil|dren, their Prie&s;ts and Friers. This was a mi&s;ery and a de&s;olation not to be paral|lell'd; a kind of <HI>Babilonian</HI> tran&s;migration. There they were all made Slaves: The hand&s;om Women were &s;hut up in the Seraglio; the old Women and others were di&s;tributed among divers <HI>Omrahs.</HI> The young Lads were circumci&s;ed, and made Pages; and men of age renounced for the mo&s;t part their Faith, either terrified by the threatnings they heard daily, that they &s;hould be trampled upon by Elephants, or drawn away by fair Promi&s;es. 'Tis true, that there were &s;ome of tho&s;e Friers, who per&s;i&s;ted, and that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>Agra,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding all this un|happine&s;s, remained in their hou&s;es, found means afterwards, partly by Friends, part|ly by Money, to get many of them away, and to have them conveyed to <HI>Goa,</HI> and to other places belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>They were al&s;o the &s;ame Pyrates, who &s;ome time before the de&s;olation of <HI>Ogouli,</HI> offered to the Vice-Roy of <HI>Goa</HI> to put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Rakan</HI> into their hands for the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> but he refu&s;ed, they &s;ay, this offer, out of arrogance and jealou&s;ie, and would not &s;end the &s;uccours, which for that end was demanded of him by a certain <HI>Ba&s;tian Con&s;alve,</HI> who had made him&s;elf head of tho&s;e people, and was
<PB N="55" REF="362">
become &s;o potent and con&s;iderable, that he married one of the Kings Daughters; be|ing unwilling that it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a man of &s;o mean Extraction as this <HI>Ba&s;tian</HI> was, had done &s;uch a Ma&s;ter-piece. But it may be &s;aid on this occa&s;ion, that this is not much to be wondred at, con&s;idering that the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Indies</HI> by &s;uch a conduct have divers times been faulty on the like occa&s;ions, in <HI>Japan,</HI> in <HI>Pegu,</HI> in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and other places; not to mention, that by this way, and that perhaps by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Divine cha&s;ti&s;ement (as they all frankly confe&s;s them&s;elves) they are become a prey to their Enemies, and fallen &s;o low in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that I know not whether they will ever recover there; whereas formerly, before they were corrupted by vice, and degenerated through plea&s;ure, they made all others tremble in tho&s;e parts; fora&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ch as then they were brave and generous men, zealous for the Chri&s;tian Religion, con&s;iderable for gallant exploits and for riches; all the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings &s;eeking their friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the &s;ame Pyrates &s;eized at that time on the I&s;le of <HI>Sondiva,</HI> an advan|tageous Po&s;t to command a part of the Mouth of <HI>Ganges:</HI> In which I&s;le a certain <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> Frier, a very famous man, acted the King for many years, having taken a cour&s;e, God knows how, to rid him&s;elf of the Commander of that place.</P>
<P>Moreover, the &s;ame Robbers took <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> at <HI>Daka,</HI> to carry him away in their Galea&s;&s;es to <HI>Rakan,</HI> as we related above, and found means to open his Co&s;&s;ers, and to rob him of good &s;tore of Jewels, which afterwards were &s;ecretly, and at a very cheap rate, &s;old in <HI>Rakan,</HI> mo&s;t of them being fallen into the hands of people that had no skill in them, and afterwards into the hands of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and others, who knew how to buy them up quickly, making tho&s;e fellows believe, that they were &s;oft Diamonds, and that they would pay them according to the <HI>degrees</HI> of their hardne&s;s.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, They are they that for many years have given exerci&s;e to the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> in <HI>Bengale;</HI> having obliged him there to keep always Garri&s;ons every where upon the Pa&s;&s;es, and a great Militia, and a Fleet al&s;o of Galea&s;&s;es to oppo&s;e their cour&s;es, and who, notwith&s;tanding all this, have made &s;hift to make &s;trange deva&s;tations, and often to enter far into the Country, and to laugh at all the Souldiery of the <HI>Mogols;</HI> in regard they were become &s;o bold, and &s;o dextrous at their Weapons, and &s;o skilful in piloting their Galea&s;&s;es, that four or five of them &s;tuck not to &s;et upon fourteen or fifteen <HI>Mogolians,</HI> which they al&s;o actually wor&s;ted, and took or run aground. And upon the&s;e Pyrates <HI>Chah he&s;t-kan</HI> ca&s;t his eyes as &s;oon as he came into <HI>Bengale,</HI> taking a re&s;olution to deliver the Country of this plague of people, that had &s;o long wa&s;ted it; and de&s;igning afterwards to pa&s;s on, and to attack the King of <HI>Rak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> ac|cording to the order of <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> who at any price had a mind to revenge the blood of <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> and all his Family, that had been &s;o cruelly handled, and to teach that Barbarian, how the Blood Royal was to be regarded and e&s;teemed on any occa&s;ion what&s;oever: Behold now with what dexterity <HI>Chah he&s;t-kan</HI> carrieth on this de&s;ign!</P>
<P>Knowing that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s any Cavalry by Land, no not &s;o much as any Infantry, from <HI>Bengale</HI> into <HI>Rakan,</HI> becau&s;e of the many channels and rivers upon the Frontiers; and al&s;o that on the other &s;ide, tho&s;e Pyrates of <HI>Chatigon,</HI> whom we ju&s;t now were &s;peaking of, would be powerful enough to hinder him from tran&s;porting them by Sea; he thought upon this experiment, <HI>viz.</HI> to engage the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in his de&s;ign. He therefore &s;ent a kind of Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Batavia,</HI> empowering him to treat upon certain Conditions, with the General of that Company, joyntly to &s;ub|due the whole Kingdom of <HI>Rakan;</HI> as formerly <HI>Chah-Abbas</HI> &s;ubdued that of <HI>Ormus,</HI> in conjunction with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The General of <HI>Batavia</HI> &s;eeing the thing to be po&s;&s;ible, and that it was a means more and more to break the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that it would turn to a very good account to the Company, di&s;patch'd away two Men of War for <HI>Bengale,</HI> to favour the tran&s;portation of the <HI>Mogolian</HI> Troops in &s;pight of tho&s;e Pyrates. But ob&s;erve what <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> did before the&s;e Men of War arrived: He equipped a great number of Galea&s;&s;es, and many large Ve&s;&s;els to tran&s;port the Army; threatned the Pyrates, utterly to &s;poil and ruin them; acquainted them with the de&s;ign of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> upon <HI>Rakan;</HI> that a potent Army of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was near; that they &s;hould think on them&s;elves and their families, if they were wi&s;e; and in a word, if they would abandon the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Rakan,</HI> and take that of

<HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> he would procure very good conditions for them, di&s;tribute among&s;t them as much Land in <HI>Bengale</HI> as they de&s;ired, and pay them the double of what they had now.</P>
<P>'Tis doubtful, whether the&s;e Menaces and Promi&s;es made impre&s;&s;ion upon them, or whether it was not an Accident that moved them, they having about that time a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated one of the chief Officers of the King of <HI>Rakan,</HI> and apprehending a puni&s;h|ment for that Crime: However it be, they were caught, and they were one day &s;truck with &s;uch a panick terror, that they &s;hipp'd them&s;elves all at once in forty or fifty of their Galea&s;&s;es, and wafted over to <HI>Bengale</HI> to <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> and that with &s;o much precipitation, that they hardly took time to embark their Wives and Children, and what el&s;e was mo&s;t precious to them. <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> receiv'd them with open Arms, courted them exceedingly, gave them very con&s;iderable Pay, and without letting them cool, made them, jointly with his whole Army, to attack and take the I&s;le of <HI>Sondiva,</HI> which was fallen into the hands of the King of <HI>Rakan,</HI> and thence to pa&s;s with all his Hor&s;e and Foot to <HI>Chatigon.</HI> About this time the two <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els arrived, but <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> who thought that henceforth it would be ea&s;ie for him to compa&s;s his de&s;ign, thanked them. I &s;aw the&s;e Ships in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and their Commanders, who were but little contented with &s;uch thanks and liberalities of <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan.</HI> As to the Pyrates, &s;ince now he holds them fa&s;t, and hopele&s;s of ever returning to <HI>Chatigon,</HI> and hath no more need of them, he makes nothing of all tho&s;e large Promi&s;es he made them, and treats them not as he &s;hould, but as they de&s;erve, leaving them whole months without Pay, and not looking upon them otherwi&s;e than Traytors, and infa|mous men, unfit to be tru&s;ted, after they have &s;o vilely de&s;erted him, who&s;e Salt they had eaten &s;o many years. After this manner did <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> put an end to this Rabble, which, as I &s;aid, have ruined and di&s;poiled all the lower <HI>Bengale.</HI> Time will &s;hew whether he will be as happy in the remainder of his Enterprize again&s;t the King of <HI>Rakan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> Particular is concerning the two Sons of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> viz. <HI>Sultan Mah|moud,</HI> and <HI>Sultan Mazum.</HI> He &s;till keeps the fir&s;t of them in <HI>Goualeor,</HI> but (if one may believe the common report) without making him take the <HI>Pou&s;t,</HI> which is the ordinary Drink of tho&s;e that are put into that place. As to the <HI>other,</HI> though he hath always been a pattern of re&s;ervedne&s;s and moderation, yet one knows not whether he was not too forward in making a Party, when his Father was &s;o extremely &s;ick; or whether <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> have not upon other occa&s;ions perceiv'd &s;omething that might give him cau&s;e of jealou&s;ie; or whether he had not a mind to make an authentick proof of both his Obedience and Courage. However it be, one day he commanded him in an unconcerned manner, in a full A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> to go and kill a <HI>Lyon</HI> that was come down to the Mountains, and had made great havock and wa&s;te in the Countrey; and this he did, without giving order to furni&s;h him with tho&s;e &s;trong and large Nets, which they are wont to employ in this dangerous kind of hunting in a real mood; telling the great Hunting-Ma&s;ter, who pre&s;ently call'd for tho&s;e Nets, that when he was Prince, he did not look for &s;uch Formalities. It was the good fortune of <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> that he pro&s;per'd in this Attempt, not lo&s;ing any more than two or three men, and &s;ome Hor&s;es that were wounded, although, on the other hand, the matter went not off &s;o plea&s;antly, the wounded <HI>Lyon</HI> having leapt up to the head of the Sultan's Elephant. Since that time, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> hath not been backward to ex|pre&s;s much Affection to him; he hath given him even the Government of <HI>Decan,</HI> though with &s;o little power and trea&s;ure, that there is no great cau&s;e to apprehend any thing upon that Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> thing toucheth <HI>Mohabet-kan,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Kaboul,</HI> whom <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> took from his Government, and generou&s;ly pardon'd; not willing, as he &s;aid, to lo&s;e &s;o brave a Captain, and that had &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to his Benefactor <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> He made him even Governor of <HI>Guzuratte,</HI> in the place of <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> whom he &s;ent to make War in <HI>Decan.</HI> It may very well be, that &s;ome con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents he made to <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> and a good number of excellent <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hor&s;e and Camels, where|with he pre&s;ented <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> together with fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and <HI>Rupies</HI> of Gold, did contribute to make his peace.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion of mentioning the Government of <HI>Kaboul,</HI> which borders upon the Kingdom of <HI>Kandahar,</HI> which is now in the hands of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> I &s;hall here

briefly add &s;ome particulars, that &s;erve to this Hi&s;tory, and will &s;till more di&s;cover that Country, and declare the Intere&s;ts between <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which no body, that I know of, hath explained hitherto.</P>
<P><HI>Kandahar,</HI> that &s;trong and important place, which is the Capital and the &s;waying Ci|ty of this Noble and Rich Kingdom of the &s;ame Name, hath in the&s;e latter Ages been the &s;ubject of grievous Wars between the <HI>Mogols</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> each of them pretend|ing a Right thereto. <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that great King of the <HI>Indies,</HI> took it by force from the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and kept it during his life. And <HI>Chah-Abbas,</HI> that famous King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> retook it from <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> the Son of <HI>Ekbar.</HI> Afterwards it return'd to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> Son of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> not by the Sword, but by the means of the Governor <HI>Aly-Mer|dan-kan,</HI> who &s;urrendred it to him, and went over to live at his Court, apprehending the Artifices of his Enemies, who had brought him into disfavour with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that &s;ent for him to make him give an accompt, and to deliver up his Govern|ment. The &s;ame City was be&s;ieged, and retaken afterwards by the Son of <HI>Chah-Ab|bas,</HI> and &s;ince that be&s;ieged twice again, yet without being taken by <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> The fir&s;t time it was &s;aved from being taken by the ill under&s;tanding and jealou&s;ie between the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Omrahs, that are Pen&s;ioners of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> and the mo&s;t powerful of his Court, as al&s;o by the re&s;pect they bear to their Natural King: For they all behaved them&s;elves very effeminately in the Siege, and would not follow the <HI>Raja Roup,</HI> who had already planted his Standards upon the Wall on the &s;ide of the Mountain. The &s;econd time it was &s;aved by the jealou&s;ie of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who would not fall into the breach of the Wall, that our <HI>Franguis,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;es, Germans</HI> and <HI>French</HI> had made by their Canon, though it was a large one; being unwilling to have it &s;aid, that in the time of <HI>Dara,</HI> who was, in a manner, the fir&s;t mover of that Enterpri&s;e, and was then in the City of <HI>Caboul,</HI> with his Father <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Kanda|har</HI> was taken. <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;ome years before the late trouble, was al&s;o ready to be|&s;iege it the third time, had not <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> diverted him from it, advi&s;ing him to turn his Forces towards <HI>Decan,</HI> (as hath been &s;aid;) with whom <HI>Aly-Merdan-kan</HI> him&s;elf concurred, who was &s;o earne&s;t in his di&s;&s;wading him from it, as to &s;ay to him the&s;e words, which I &s;hall punctually relate, as having &s;omething extravagant in them:</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty will never take <HI>Kandahar,</HI> unle&s;s you had &s;uch a Traytor there as my &s;elf, except you were re&s;olved never to bring a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> into it, and to make the Bazars or Markets wholly free, that is, to lay no Impo&s;t on tho&s;e that furni&s;h the Army with pro|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length, <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> like the others, had prepared him&s;elf in the&s;e latter years to be&s;iege it al&s;o; whether it was that he was offended at the tart Letters, written to him by the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or by rea&s;on of the affronts and ill treatment which he had offer'd to <HI>Tarbiet-kan</HI> his Amba&s;&s;ador; that hearing of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s death, he turned back, &s;aying, (which yet is not very credible) that he would not meddle with a Child, a new King; although <HI>Chah-Soliman,</HI> who hath &s;ucceeded his Father, is, in my opinion, about 25 years of age.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ixth</HI> particular we purpo&s;ed to &s;peak of, concerns tho&s;e that have faithfully &s;er|ved <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Tho&s;e he hath almo&s;t all rai&s;ed to great places. For fir&s;t, as we have already related, he made <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> his Uncle, Governor and General of the Army of <HI>Decan,</HI> and afterwards, Governor of <HI>Bengale.</HI> Next, he made <HI>Mir-kan</HI> Governor of <HI>Kaboul;</HI> Then <HI>Kalil-ullah-kan,</HI> of <HI>Lahor;</HI> and <HI>Mirbaba,</HI> of <HI>Elabas;</HI> and <HI>Lasker-kan,</HI> of <HI>Patna.</HI> The Son of that <HI>Allah-Verdi-kan</HI> of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> he appointed Governor of <HI>Scimdy;</HI> and <HI>Fazel-kan,</HI> who had con&s;iderably &s;erv'd him both by his coun&s;els and dexterity, he made <HI>Kane-&s;aman,</HI> that is, Great Steward of the Hou&s;e Royal: And <HI>Da|nechmend-kan,</HI> Governor of <HI>Dehli,</HI> with this particular grace and priviledge, that &s;ince he is perpetually employed in &s;tudies and foreign Affairs, he &s;o di&s;pen&s;eth with him for not coming twice a day (after the ancient cu&s;tom) to wait on the King in the A&s;&s;em|bly, as not to retrench any thing of his pen&s;ion for his ab&s;ence, as he doth to the other Omrahs, if they fail. He hath given to <HI>Dianet-kan</HI> the Government of <HI>Kacihmer</HI> (alias <HI>Ca&s;&s;imere)</HI> that little, and in a manner inacce&s;&s;ible Kingdom, which <HI>Ekbar</HI> &s;ei|zed on by craft, that earthly Paradi&s;e of the <HI>Indies;</HI> which hath its Hi&s;tories written in its peculiar Language, whereof I have an abridgment in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue, made by the command of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> containing a large Catalogue of many very ancient

Kings, that often were &s;o powerful, that they &s;ubdued the <HI>Indies</HI> as far as <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Nejabat-kan,</HI> who did very well in the two Battels of <HI>Samonguer</HI> and <HI>Kadjoue,</HI> but then 'tis not fit at all, that a Subject &s;hould ever reproach his King, as he did, with the &s;ervices done him.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e infamous men, <HI>Gion-kan</HI> and <HI>Nazer,</HI> 'tis known, that the former hath been recompenced as he de&s;erved; but the other no man knows what is become of him.</P>
<P>What concerns <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> there is &s;omething as to them that is intri|cate, which I &s;hall endeavour to unfold. There is a certain Heathen revolted from the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> who knew how to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of many important Fortre&s;&s;es, and of &s;ome Sea-ports of that King. His name is <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> that is, Lord <HI>Seva.</HI> He is a &s;tout man, vigilant, bold, and undertaking in the highe&s;t degree, who gave <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> more work and trouble in <HI>Decan,</HI> than the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> with all his Forces, and all his <HI>Raja's</HI> joined with him for their common defence: In&s;omuch that having de&s;igned to take away <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan</HI> and his Trea&s;ures out of the mid&s;t of his Army, and of the Town <HI>Aurenge-Abad,</HI> he carried on his de&s;ign &s;o far, that he had effected it, if he had not been di&s;cover'd a little too &s;oon; for one night, accompanied with a number of re&s;olute Fellows he hath about him, he was got into the very apartment of <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> where his Son, who was forward in the defence, was killed, and him&s;elf grievou&s;ly wounded; <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> in the mean time getting away as well as he came: Who for all this was &s;o far from being daunted, that he undertook another very bold and very dangerous Enterpri&s;e, which &s;ucceeded much better. He took two or three Thou|&s;and cho&s;en men of his Army, with whom he took the Field without noi&s;e, &s;preading a report by the way, that it was a <HI>Raja</HI> going to the Court. When he was near <HI>Su|ratte,</HI> that famous and rich Port of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in&s;tead of marching further, (as he made the great Provo&s;t of that Country, whom he met, believe) he fell into that Town, where he &s;taid about three days, cutting off the Arms and Legs of the Inha|bitants, to make them confe&s;s where were the Trea&s;ures; &s;earching, digging, and load|ing away, or burning what he could not carry with him. Which done, he returned, none oppo&s;ing his return, loaden with millions of Gold, Silver, Pearls, Silken Stuffs, Fine Linnen, and other rich Merchandi&s;e. <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> was &s;u&s;pected to have had &s;ince intelligence with this <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> which was the cau&s;e that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> called him away from <HI>Decan;</HI> but he, in&s;tead of going to <HI>Dehli,</HI> went to his own Territory.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention, that in the plunder of <HI>Suratte,</HI> that Ringleader <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> like a Saint, had &s;o much re&s;pect to the Hou&s;e of the Reverend Father <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> a Mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Capucian,</HI> that he gave order it &s;hould not be plundered; becau&s;e, &s;aid he, I know that the Fathers <HI>Franguis</HI> are good men. He had al&s;o regard to the Hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed <HI>de Lale,</HI> becau&s;e he under&s;tood that he had been great Almoner. He al&s;o con&s;ider'd the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> not from Devotion, as he did the former, but be|cau&s;e they were in a good po&s;ture of defence; e&s;pecially the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who having had time to &s;end for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from &s;ome of their &s;hips that lay near the Town, behaved them&s;elves gallantly, and &s;aved, be&s;ides their own, &s;everal other hou&s;es near them. But a certain <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who had brought Rubies of a very great value, to &s;ell them to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> carried away the Bell from all, by &s;aving him&s;elf from the hands of <HI>Seva-Gi;</HI> for, rather than to confe&s;s that he had any Jewels, he was brought thrice upon his Knees, and the Knife held up to cut his Throat: But it became none &s;ave a <HI>Jew,</HI> hardly in Avarice, to e&s;cape in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> King <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made him content to go General of the Army in <HI>Decan,</HI> &s;ending <HI>Sultan-Mazum</HI> with him, without any power. He pre&s;ently and vigorou&s;ly be&s;ieged the principal Fortre&s;s of <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> and knowing more than all the re&s;t in matter of Negotiation and Treaty, he &s;o order'd the bu&s;ine&s;s, that <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> &s;ur|rendred before it came to extremity; and then he drew him to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s party again&s;t <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> King <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> declaring him a <HI>Raja,</HI> taking him under his pro|tection, and giving the Pen&s;ion of a very con&s;iderable <HI>Omrah</HI> to his Son. Some time after, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> de&s;igning to make War again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> wrote to <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> &s;uch obli|ging Letters touching his Genero&s;ity, Ability and Conduct, that he made him re&s;olve, upon the faith of <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> to come to him to <HI>Debli.</HI> There a Kin&s;woman of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> (who was then at Court) by the influence &s;he had upon the &s;pirit of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> per&s;uaded him to arre&s;t him that had murder'd her

Son, wounded her Husband, and &s;acked <HI>Suratte:</HI> So that one evening <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> &s;aw his Pavilions be&s;et with three or four <HI>Omrahs;</HI> but he made &s;hift to get away in the night. This e&s;cape made a great noi&s;e at Court, every one accu&s;ing the elde&s;t Son of the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it. <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> who pre&s;ently had news that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was very angry with him and his Son, and was advi&s;ed no more to go to the Court, was day and night upon his guard, apprehending le&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould take this for a pre|tence to fall upon his Lands, and po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of them. Whereupon he al&s;o &s;oon left <HI>Decan</HI> to &s;ecure his E&s;tate; but when he was at <HI>Brampour,</HI> he died. Yet notwith|&s;tanding <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was &s;o far from expre&s;&s;ing any coldne&s;s or re&s;entment to the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> that he &s;ent to condole with him for the death of his Father, and con|tinued to him his Pen&s;ion; which confirms what many &s;ay, that it was by the con&s;ent of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf, that <HI>Seva-Gi</HI> e&s;caped, fora&s;much as he could retain him no longer at Court, becau&s;e all the Women there had too great a &s;pleen again&s;t him, and looked upon him as a man that had embroiled his hands in the blood of his Kin&s;men.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Decan,</HI> we are to con&s;ider, that that is a Kingdom, which the&s;e For|ty years hath con&s;tantly been the Theater of War, and upon the &s;core whereof the <HI>Mo|gol</HI> hath much to do with the Kings of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and divers little So|veraigns, which is not to be under&s;tood, unle&s;s it be known, what con&s;iderable things have pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Parts, and the condition of the Princes that govern them.</P>
<P>All this great Penin&s;ule of <HI>Inde&s;tan,</HI> cutting it from the Bay of <HI>Cambaja</HI> unto that of <HI>Bengale,</HI> near <HI>Jaganrate,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing thence to Cape <HI>Comori,</HI> was &s;carce two hundred years &s;ince entirely (&s;ome mountainous Parts excepted) under the Dominion of one only Prince, who con&s;equently was a very great and very potent Monarch: But now it is divided among many different Soveraigns, that are al&s;o of different Religions. The cau&s;e of this divi&s;ion was, that the King <HI>Ramras,</HI> the la&s;t of tho&s;e that have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this mighty State entirely, did imprudently rai&s;e three Slaves, <HI>gurgis,</HI> he had about him too high, &s;o as to make them all three Governors of places: The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e Countries, which at pre&s;ent are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Mogol</HI> in <HI>Decan,</HI> about <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> from <HI>Bider, Paranda, Suratte,</HI> unto <HI>Narbadar:</HI> The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> of all the other Lands, now comprehended under the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour:</HI> And the <HI>third,</HI> of all that is contained under the Kingdom of <HI>Golkonda.</HI> The&s;e three Slaves grew very rich, and found them&s;elves &s;upported by a good number of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> that were in the &s;ervice of <HI>Ramras,</HI> becau&s;e they were all three <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> of the Sect <HI>Chyas,</HI> like the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> And at length they all revolted together with one accord, kil|led King <HI>Ramras,</HI> and return'd to their Government, each taking upon him the Title of <HI>Chah</HI> or King. The I&s;&s;ue of <HI>Ramras,</HI> not finding them&s;elves &s;trong enough for them, were content to keep them&s;elves in a corner, <HI>viz.</HI> in that Country which is com|monly call'd <HI>Karnatek</HI> in our Maps, <HI>Bi&s;naguer,</HI> where they are &s;till <HI>Raja's</HI> to this very day. All the re&s;t of the State was al&s;o at the &s;ame time divided into all tho&s;e <HI>Raja's Naiques,</HI> and petty Kings, &s;uch as we &s;ee there. The&s;e three Slaves and their Po&s;teri|ty have always defended them&s;elves very well in their Kingdoms, whil'&s;t they kept a good mutual Corre&s;pondence, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted one another in their grievous Wars again&s;t the <HI>Mogols.</HI> But when they once came to think every one to defend their Lands apart, they &s;oon found the effects of their divi&s;ion. For the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;o well knew to take his time upon that occa&s;ion, (which is now about Thirty five, or Forty years &s;ince) that he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf within a little time of all the Country of <HI>Nejam-Chah,</HI> or King <HI>Nejam,</HI> the fifth or &s;ixth of the Family of the fir&s;t Slave, and at la&s;t took him Pri&s;oner in <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> the Capital, where he died.</P>
<P>After that time, the Kings of <HI>Golkonda</HI> have maintain'd them&s;elves well enough; not as if they could compare with the power of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> but becau&s;e the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath always been employ'd again&s;t the two others; from whom he was to take <HI>Amber, Pa|randa, Bider,</HI> and &s;ome other places, before he could conveniently march towards <HI>Gol|konda.</HI> And becau&s;e they have always been &s;o politick, being very opulent, as to fur|ni&s;h under-hand the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> with Money, and thereby to help him to main|tain a War again&s;t the <HI>Mogol:</HI> Be&s;ides that, they ever have a con&s;iderable Army on foot, which is always ready, and never fails to take the Field, and to approach to the Fron|tiers, at the time when there is News that that of the <HI>Mogol</HI> marches again&s;t <HI>Vi&s;apour;</HI> to let the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;ee, not only that they are always ready to defend them&s;elves, but al&s;o that they could ea&s;ily a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould be reduced to any ex|tremity.
<PB N="60" REF="365">
Next, which is very con&s;iderable, they know al&s;o how to convey Mony un|derhand to the Chieftains of the <HI>Mogolian</HI> Army; who thereupon advi&s;e the Court, that it is more to purpo&s;e to attack <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> as being nearer to <HI>Daulet-Abad.</HI> Fur|ther, They &s;end every year very con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents to the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> by way of Tribute, which con&s;i&s;t partly in &s;ome rare Manufactures of the Country; partly in Elephants, which they &s;end for from <HI>Pegu, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Ceilan,</HI> partly in fair ready mo|ny. La&s;tly, The <HI>Mogol</HI> con&s;iders that Kingdom as his own, not only becau&s;e he looks upon the King thereof as his Tributary, but chiefly &s;ince that Agreement heretofore &s;poken of, which the pre&s;ent King made with <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> when he be&s;ieg'd <HI>Golkonda;</HI> and there being al&s;o no place able to re&s;i&s;t, even from <HI>Daulet-Abad</HI> unto <HI>Golkonda,</HI> he judgeth, that when he &s;hall think fit to pu&s;h for it, he may take in the whole Kingdom in one Campagne; which, in my opinion, he would certainly have done, if he did not apprehend, le&s;t &s;ending his Forces towaids <HI>Golkonda,</HI> the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> &s;hould en|ter into <HI>Decon;</HI> as, no doubt, he would do, knowing it to be very important to his Con&s;ervation, that that Kingdom may always &s;ub&s;i&s;t as now it is.</P>
<P>From all which, &s;omething may be under&s;tood of the Intere&s;ts and Government of the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> with the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and what way he taketh to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t him. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, I find this State much &s;haken, in regard that the King that now is, &s;ince that unhappy Affair of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> &s;eems to have lo&s;t heart, and as 'twere abandon'd the reins of the Kingdom, not daring any more to go forth of this Fortre&s;s of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> nor &s;o much as appear in publick to give Audience to his People, and to render Ju&s;tice, according to the cu&s;tom of the Coun|try: Which di&s;compo&s;eth things very much, and occa&s;ions the Grandees to tyrannize over the meaner &s;ort of People, and to lo&s;e even their re&s;pect to the King, often &s;light|ing his Commands, and con&s;idering him no more than a Woman; and the People, weary of the inju&s;tice and ill treatment, breathing after nothing but <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;ie to judge of the &s;treights this poor King is in, by four or five Particulars I am about to relate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1667. when I was at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> King <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> having &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary to declare War to that King, unle&s;s he would furni&s;h him with Ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e again&s;t <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> he did extraordinary honour, and give exce&s;&s;ive Pre&s;ents to that Amba&s;&s;ador, as well for him in particular, as for <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and made an agreement with him, to &s;end him, not Ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e, but as much Mony as is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain &s;o many; which was all that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> look|ed for.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is, That <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador in Ordinary, that is con&s;tantly at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> commands, threatens, &s;triketh, gives Pa&s;s-ports, and &s;aith and doth what|&s;oever he will, no man daring with the lea&s;t word to cro&s;s him.</P>
<P>The third is, That <HI>Mahmet-Emir-kan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> though he be no more than a &s;imple <HI>Omrab</HI> of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> is yet &s;o much re&s;pected through that whole Kingdom, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> that the <HI>Taptata,</HI> his Commi&s;&s;ioner, is, as 'twere, Ma&s;ter thereof, buying and &s;elling, bringing in and &s;ending abroad his Mer|chants Ships, no Body daring to contradict him in any thing, nor to demand any Cu&s;toms. So great was once the power of <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> his Father in this Kingdom, which time hath not yet been able to root out.</P>
<P>The fourth is, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;cruple not to threaten him &s;ometimes, to lay an Embargo upon all the Merchants Ships of the Country that are in that Port, and not to let them go out, until their demands be granted; as al&s;o to put in Prote&s;tations again&s;t him: which I have &s;een actually done, upon the account of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which they had a mind to take by force in the Port of <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> it &s;elf, the Gover|nor having hindred it, by arming the whole Town again&s;t them, and threatning to put Fire to their Factory, and to put them all to death.</P>
<P>A fifth is, That the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> as poor, and mi&s;erable, and decayed, as they are in the <HI>Indies,</HI> yet &s;tick not to threaten that King al&s;o with War; and that they will come and &s;ack <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> and all that Coa&s;t, if he will not render them that place of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which &s;ome years ago they cho&s;e to put into his hands, rather than to be con&s;trained to yield it up to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Yet for all this, I have been informed in <HI>Golkonda,</HI> by very intelligent per&s;ons, that this King is a Prince of very great judgment, and that whatever he &s;o does and &s;uf|fers, is only in policy, to the end to provoke no body, and principally to remove all
<PB N="61" REF="365">
&s;u&s;pition from <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to give him to under&s;tand, that he hath in a manner no &s;hare any more in the Kingdom: But that in the mean time a Son of his, that is kept hid, grows up, the Father watching for a fit time to declare him King, and &s;o to laugh at the Agreement made with <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Of this, time will &s;hew us more; in the mean time, let us con&s;ider &s;omewhat of the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> hath al&s;o not been wanting to &s;upport it &s;elf, though the <HI>Mogol</HI> do almo&s;t continually make War again&s;t it; not &s;o much as if he of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> were able to bid head to the <HI>Mogolian</HI> Forces, but becau&s;e there is never any great effort u&s;ed again&s;t him. For it is not very frequent there, no more than 'tis el&s;ewhere, for Generals of Armies to de&s;ire the end of a War; there being nothing &s;o charming, as to be in the head of an Army, commanding like little Kings, remote from the Court. It is al&s;o grown to a Proverb, That <HI>Decan</HI> is the Bread and Life of the Soldiers of <HI>In|do&s;tan.</HI> Be&s;ides, the Country of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> is on the &s;ide of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Dominions of a very difficult acce&s;s, upon the account of the &s;carcity of good Waters, Forage, and Victuals; and becau&s;e <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the Capital City, is very &s;trong, and &s;ituate in a dry and &s;teril Country, there being almo&s;t no good Water but in the Town. And la&s;t|ly, becau&s;e there are many Fortre&s;&s;es in that Country, &s;eated on Hills hard to climb.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, that State is much &s;haken, if con&s;idering that the <HI>Mo|gol</HI> hath taken <HI>Paranda,</HI> the Key, as 'twere, of that Kingdom; as al&s;o that fair and &s;trong Town <HI>Bider,</HI> and &s;ome other very important places: But principally, becau&s;e the la&s;t King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> died without Heirs Males, and he that now calls him&s;elf King, is a Youth, whom the Queen, Si&s;ter of the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> hath rai&s;ed, and taken for her Son (a favour for which he hath made an ill return, having &s;hew'd no e&s;teem for this Queen after her return from <HI>Mecca,</HI> under the pretext of &s;ome ill demeanor in her on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that carried her to <HI>Moka:)</HI> La&s;tly, becau&s;e that in the di&s;orders of that Kingdom, the Heathen-Rebel, <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> above di&s;cour&s;ed of, found means to &s;eize on many &s;trong Holds, mo&s;tly &s;eated on &s;teep Mountains, where he now acteth the King, laughing at the <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and ravaging the Country every where, from <HI>Suratte,</HI> even to the Gates of <HI>Goa.</HI> This notwith&s;tanding, if he wrongs <HI>Vi&s;a|pour</HI> one way, he helps to &s;upport it another, fora&s;much as he is re&s;olutely bent again&s;t the <HI>Mogol,</HI> preparing always &s;ome Ambu&s;h, and cutting &s;o much work for his Army, that there is no di&s;cour&s;e, no apprehen&s;ion but of <HI>Seva-Gi;</HI> in&s;omuch that he hath come and &s;acked <HI>Suratte,</HI> and pillaged the I&s;le of <HI>Burdes,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> and is near the Gates of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;eventh</HI> Particular, which I learn'd at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when I was come away from <HI>Dehli,</HI> is the death of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> and that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had been exceedingly affect|ed therewith, having di&s;cover'd all the marks of grief, that a Son can expre&s;s for the lo&s;s of his Father: That at the very hour of receiving that News, he went towards <HI>Agra;</HI> that <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> cau&s;ed the Mo&s;quee, and a certain place, where he was at fir&s;t to &s;top, before he entred the Fortre&s;s, to be hung with richly embroider'd Tapi&s;teries: That at his entring into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> &s;he pre&s;ented him with a great Golden Ba&s;on, wherein were all her Jewels, and all tho&s;e of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> and in &s;hort, that &s;he knew to receive him with &s;o much Magnificence, and to entertain him with that dexterity and craft, that &s;he obtain'd his pardon, gain'd his favour, and grew very confident with him.</P>
<P>To conclude, I doubt not, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who &s;hall have read my Hi&s;tory, will judge the ways taken by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> for getting the Empire, very violent and horrid. I pretend not at all to plead for him, but de&s;ire only, that before he be altogether con|demned, reflection be made on that unhappy cu&s;tom of this State, which leaving the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown undecided, for want of good Laws, &s;etling it, as among&s;t us, upon the elde&s;t Son, expo&s;eth it to the Conque&s;t of the &s;tronge&s;t, and the mo&s;t fortu|nate, &s;ubjecting at the &s;ame time all the Princes born in the Royal Family, by the con|dition of their Birth, to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity either to overcome, or to reign, by de&s;troy|ing all the re&s;t, for the a&s;&s;urance of their power and life, or to peri&s;h them&s;elves, for the &s;ecurity of that of others: For I am apt to believe, that upon this Con&s;ideration, the Reader will not find <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Conduct &s;o &s;trange as at fir&s;t it appear'd. How|ever I am per&s;uaded, that tho&s;e who &s;hall a little weigh this whole Hi&s;tory, will not take <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> for a <HI>Barbarian,</HI> but for a great and rare <HI>Genius,</HI> a Great States-man, and a Great King.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce it is the Cu&s;tom of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> never to approach Great Per&s;ons with Empty Hands, when I had the Honour to ki&s;s the Ve&s;t of the Great <HI>Mogol Aureng Zebe,</HI> I pre&s;ented him with eight <HI>Roupies, \[A</HI> Roupy <HI>is about Half a Crown\]</HI> as an expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;pect; and the illu&s;trious <HI>Fazel-kan,</HI> the prime Mini&s;ter of State, and he that was to e&s;tabli&s;h my Pen&s;ion as Phy&s;itian, with a Ca&s;e of Knives garni&s;hed with Amber. <HI>My Lord,</HI> though I intend not to introduce new Cu&s;toms in <HI>France,</HI> yet I cannot forget this upon my Return from tho&s;e Parts; being per&s;uaded, that I ought not to appear before the <HI>King,</HI> for whom I have a far deeper Veneration, than for <HI>Au|reng-Zebe;</HI> nor before <HI>You, my Lord,</HI> for whom I have a much higher E&s;teem, than for <HI>Fazel-kan,</HI> without &s;ome little Pre&s;ent to both, which is rare, at lea&s;t, for its Novelty, though it be not &s;o upon the account of the pre&s;enting hand. The Revolution of <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI> by rea&s;on of its extraordinary Occurrences and Events, hath to me &s;eemed worthy of the Greatne&s;s of our Monarch, and this Di&s;cour&s;e, for the quality of the matters therein contained, &s;utable <HI>to</HI> the rank you hold in his Coun&s;els; <HI>to</HI> that Con|duct, which at my Return appear'd to me &s;o admirable in the Order, which I found &s;et|led in &s;o many things, that I thought incapable of it; and <HI>to</HI> the pa&s;&s;ion you entertain to make it known to the Ends of the Earth, what a Monarch we have, and that the <HI>French</HI> are fit to undertake, and with Honour to atchieve, what&s;oever you &s;hall have de&s;ign'd for their Honour and Advantage.</P>
<P>'Tis in the <HI>Indies, my Lord</HI> (whence I am lately return'd, after twelve years ab&s;ence) where I learn'd the felicity of <HI>France,</HI> and how much this Kingdom is oblig'd to your cares; and where your Name is &s;o diffu&s;ed, and &s;o well known. This were a fair Theme for me to enlarge upon; but my De&s;ign being no other than to di&s;cour&s;e of things <HI>New,</HI> I mu&s;t forbear to &s;peak of tho&s;e that are already &s;o notorious to all the World. I &s;hall doubtle&s;s plea&s;e you better, by endeavouring to give you &s;ome <HI>Idea</HI> of the &s;tate of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which I have engaged my &s;elf to give you an account of.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> You may have &s;een before this, by the Maps of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> how great every way is the Extent of the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> which is commonly call'd <HI>India,</HI> or <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> I have not mea&s;ur'd it Mathematically; but to &s;peak of it according to the ordinary Journeys of the Country, after the rate of three whole months march, tra|ver&s;ing from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> as far as beyond <HI>Kazni</HI> near <HI>Kandahar,</HI> which is the fir&s;t Town of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> I cannot per&s;uade my &s;elf otherwi&s;e, but that it is at lea&s;t five times as far as from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Lyons,</HI> that is, about Five hundred common Leagues.</P>
<P>Next, You may plea&s;e to take notice, that of that va&s;t Extent of Land, there are large Countries that are very fertil, and &s;ome of them to that degree, (for Example, that whole great Kingdom of <HI>Bengale)</HI> that they exceed tho&s;e of <HI>Egypt,</HI> not only up|on the account of the abundance of Rice, Corn, and all other things nece&s;&s;ary for life, but al&s;o upon the &s;core of all tho&s;e Commodities &s;o con&s;iderable, which <HI>Egypt</HI> is de&s;ti|tute of, as Silks, Cottons, Indigo, and &s;o many others, &s;ufficiently related by Au|thors.</P>
<P>Moreover, That of the&s;e &s;ame Countries there are many that are well enough peopled and cultivated, and where Trade&s;men, though naturally very lazy there, are not want|ing, either from Nece&s;&s;ity, or other Cau&s;es, to apply them&s;elves to work, as to Ta|pi&s;&s;eries, Embroideries, Cloth of Gold and Silver, and to all tho&s;e kinds of
<PB N="63" REF="366">
Silk and Cotton Manufactures, that are u&s;ed in the Country, or tran&s;ported to other Parts.</P>
<P>You may further ob&s;erve; how that Gold and Silver circulating as it were upon the Earth, comes at la&s;t, in part, to be &s;wallow'd up in this <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> For of that which comes out of <HI>America,</HI> and is di&s;per&s;ed through the &s;everal Kingdoms of our <HI>Europe,</HI> we know, that one part is carried into <HI>Turky</HI> many ways, for the Commodities drawn thence; and that another part is conveyed into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by the way of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> for the Silks afforded there: That all <HI>Turky</HI> generally needs <HI>Coffee,</HI> which comes out of <HI>Hye|man,</HI> or <HI>Happy Arabia,</HI> and is the common Drink of the <HI>Turks:</HI> That the &s;ame <HI>Turky</HI> as well as <HI>Hyeman</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> cannot be without the Commodities of <HI>India;</HI> and that thus all tho&s;e Countries are obliged to carry to <HI>Moka</HI> over the Red-Sea, near <HI>Babel-mandel;</HI> and to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> the utmo&s;t part of the <HI>Per&s;ian-Gulf;</HI> and to <HI>Bandar-Abba&s;i,</HI> or <HI>Gomoron</HI> near to <HI>Ormus,</HI> a part of that Gold and Silver, that had been brought into their Coun|try, to be thence tran&s;ported into <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> in Ve&s;&s;els, that yearly, in the &s;ea&s;on of the <HI>Moun&s;ons,</HI> come purpo&s;ely to tho&s;e three famous Parts: That on the other hand, all tho&s;e Ships of <HI>India,</HI> whether they be <HI>Indian</HI> ones, or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that every year tran&s;port Merchandi&s;e out of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> to <HI>Pegu, Tana&s;&s;eri, Siam, Ceilan, Achem, Maca&s;&s;er,</HI> the <HI>Maldives, Mo&s;ambic,</HI> and other places, bring back al&s;o much Gold and Silver from all tho&s;e Countries, which meets with the &s;ame De&s;tiny, that the other-doth: That of that quantity of Gold and Silver which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> draw from <HI>Japan,</HI> (which is &s;tored with Mines) a part al&s;o comes to be at length di&s;charged in this <HI>Indo&s;tan:</HI> And that la&s;tly, what is carried thither directly by Sea, whether from <HI>Portugal, England,</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> &s;eldom comes back from thence but in Merchandi&s;e, the re&s;t remaining there, as the former.</P>
<P>I very well know, that it may be &s;aid, that this <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> needs Copper, Cloves, Nut|megs, Cinamon, Elephants, and &s;undry other things, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> carry thi|ther from <HI>Japan,</HI> the <HI>Molueques, Ceilan,</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> as al&s;o that it hath occa&s;ion for Lead, which in part, it is furni&s;h'd with out of <HI>England;</HI> likewi&s;e for Scarlet, which it hath from <HI>France:</HI> Moreover, that it &s;tands in need of a good number of Hor&s;es, it being certain, that from the &s;ide of <HI>&V;sbec</HI> it receives yearly more than 2500. That out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> al&s;o it is furni&s;hed with abundance of the &s;ame; as al&s;o out of <HI>Ethiopia, Arabia,</HI> the Ports of <HI>Moka, Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and <HI>Bander-abba&s;y:</HI> Be&s;ides, that it needs that &s;tore of fre&s;h Fruit, which comes thither from <HI>Samarkand, Ball-bocara,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as Melons, Apples, Pears, and Grapes, that are &s;pent at <HI>Dehli,</HI> and bought at great Rates, almo&s;t all the Winter long; as well as dry Fruit, which are had there all the year long, and come from the &s;ame Countries, as Almonds, Pi&s;taches, Nuts, Prunes, Abricots, Rai&s;ins, and the like. And that la&s;tly, it wants tho&s;e little Sea-cockles of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> which &s;erve for common Coyn in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and in &s;ome other places, as al&s;o Amber|griece, carried thither from the &s;aid <HI>Maldives</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;ambic,</HI> Rhinoceros-horns, Ele|phants-teeth, Musk, China-di&s;hes, Pearls of <HI>Babaren,</HI> and <HI>Tutucoury</HI> near <HI>Ceilan;</HI> and, I know not of how many other things of this kind.</P>
<P>But all this makes not the Gold and Silver to go out of that Empire, becau&s;e the Mer|chants at their return freight their Ships with the Commodities of the Country, finding a better account by &s;o doing, than if they &s;hould bring back Mony, &s;o that that hin|ders not, but that <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> proves, as we have &s;aid, a kind of Aby&s;s for a great part of the Gold and Silver of the World, which finds many ways to enter there, and almo&s;t none to i&s;&s;ue thence.</P>
<P>In a word, you may take notice, that this <HI>Great Mogol</HI> makes him&s;elf Heir of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords, and of the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> or petty Lords, that are in his Pay; and (which is of very great con&s;equence) that all the Lands of that Empire are his Pro|priety, excepting &s;ome Hou&s;es and Gardens, which he giveth leave to his Subjects to &s;ell, divide, or buy among&s;t them, as they &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the things, which &s;ufficiently &s;how, <HI>both</HI> that there mu&s;t needs be a very great &s;tore of Gold and Silver in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> though there be no Mines; <HI>and</HI> al&s;o that the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> the Soveraign of the fame, at lea&s;t, of the be&s;t part of it, hath immen&s;e Revenues and Riches.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, there are al&s;o many things to be ob&s;erved, which are a poi&s;e to the&s;e Riches. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that among tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of Land there is much, which is nothing but &s;and and &s;teril Mountains, little Tilled or Peopled: That even of tho&s;e that would be fertile, there is much, that is not u&s;ed for want of Workmen, &s;ome of
<PB N="64" REF="367">
which have peri&s;h'd by the too evil treatment of the Governors, who often take from them their nece&s;&s;ary livelihood, and &s;ometimes their very Children whom they make Slaves when they are not able, or are unwilling to pay: Others have abandon'd the Field for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and de&s;ponding out of the con&s;ideration that they labour'd only for others, have ca&s;t them&s;elves into Towns, or into Armies, to &s;erve there for Porters, or waiting men, and many have fled to the lands of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> becau&s;e there they found le&s;s tyranny, and more kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, That in this &s;ame Extent of Country there are &s;undry Nations, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> is not full Ma&s;ter of, mo&s;t of them retaining yet their particular Soveraigns and Lords, that obey him not, nor pay him Tribute but from con&s;traint; many, that do little; &s;ome, that do nothing at all; and &s;ome al&s;o, that receive Tribute from him, as we &s;hall &s;ee anon. Such are tho&s;e petty Soveraigns, that are &s;eated on the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who almo&s;t never pay him any thing, no more than they do to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> As al&s;o the <HI>Balouches</HI> and <HI>Augans,</HI> and other Mountineers, of whom al&s;o the greate&s;t part pay him but a &s;mall matter, and even care but very little for him: wit|ne&s;s the Affront they did him, when they &s;topp'd his whole Army by cutting off the Water, which they kept back within the Mountains, when he pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Atek</HI> on the River <HI>Indus</HI> to <HI>Caboul,</HI> to lay &s;iege to <HI>Kandahar;</HI> not &s;uffering the Water to run down into the Fields, where was the Highway, 'till they had receiv'd Pre&s;ents, although they ask'd them by way of Alms. Such are al&s;o the <HI>Patans,</HI> a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> People, i&s;&s;ued from the &s;ide of the River <HI>Ganges</HI> towards <HI>Bengale;</HI> who before the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Mogols</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> had taken their time to make them&s;elves potent in many places, and chiefly at <HI>Dehli,</HI> and to render many <HI>Rajas</HI> thereabout their Tributaries. The&s;e <HI>Patans</HI> are fierce and warlike, and even the meane&s;t of them, though they be waiting Men and Porters, are &s;till of a very high &s;pirit, being often heard to &s;ay by way of &s;wearing, <HI>Let me never be King of</HI> Dehli, <HI>if it be not &s;o:</HI> A People that de&s;pife the <HI>Indians, Hea|then,</HI> and <HI>Mogols,</HI> and mortally hate the la&s;t, &s;till remembring what they were formerly, before they were by them driven away from their large Principalities, and con&s;trained to retire hither and thither, far from <HI>Dehli,</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> into the Mountains, where now they are &s;etled, and where &s;ome of them have made them&s;elves petty Soveraigns, like <HI>Rajas,</HI> but of &s;mall &s;trength.</P>
<P>Such an one al&s;o is the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> who pays to the <HI>Mogol</HI> nothing, and is al|ways in War with him; maintaining him&s;elf in his Country, partly by his own For|ces, partly becau&s;e he is very remote from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> the ordinary places of Re|&s;idence of the <HI>Great Mogol;</HI> partly al&s;o, becau&s;e his Capital City <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> is &s;trong, and of difficult acce&s;s to an Army, by rea&s;on of the ill Waters, and the want of Forage on the way; and partly becau&s;e many <HI>Rajas</HI> join with him for their common defence, as did the famous <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> who, not long &s;ince, came pillaging and burning that rich Sea-port, <HI>Suratte,</HI> and who &s;ometimes will pay little or no Tribute.</P>
<P>Such is likewi&s;e that potent and rich King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> who underhand gives Mony to the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and hath always an Army ready on the Frontiers for his own defence, and for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> in ca&s;e he find him too much pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Of the like &s;ort are more than an hundred <HI>Rajas,</HI> or con&s;iderable <HI>Heathen</HI> Soveraigns, di&s;per&s;ed through the whole Empire, &s;ome near to, others remote from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli:</HI> among&s;t whom there are about fifteen or &s;ixteen that are very rich and pui&s;&s;ant; &s;uch as is <HI>Rana</HI> (who formerly was, as 'twere, Emperor of the <HI>Rajas;</HI> and who is &s;aid to be of the Progeny of King <HI>Porus;) Je&s;&s;eignae</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eignae,</HI> which are &s;o great and powerful, that if they three alone &s;hould combine, they would hold him tack; each of them being able, in a very &s;hort time, to rai&s;e and bring into the Field Twenty five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, better Troops than the <HI>Mogols.</HI> The&s;e Gavaliers are call'd <HI>Ragi|pouts,</HI> or the Children of <HI>Rajas.</HI> They are men, who, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, carry Swords from Father to Son, and to whom the <HI>Rajas</HI> allot Land, on condition to be al|ways ready to appear on Hor&s;eback, when the <HI>Raja</HI> commands. They can endure much hard&s;hip, and they want nothing to make them good Soldiers, but good Order and Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> thing to be noted is, That the <HI>Mogol</HI> is a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> not of the Sect cal|led <HI>Chias,</HI> who follow <HI>Aly</HI> and his Off-&s;pring, (&s;uch as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are, and con&s;equent|ly the greate&s;t part of his Court;) but of that, which follows <HI>O&s;man,</HI> and thence are call'd <HI>O&s;manlys,</HI> &s;uch as the <HI>Turks</HI> are. Be&s;ides, that he is a &s;tranger, being of the Race of <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> who was the Head of tho&s;e <HI>Mogols,</HI> that about the year 1401, over-ran

<HI>India,</HI> where they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters: &s;o that he is in a Country, almo&s;t all ho&s;tile; and that the more, becau&s;e not only for one <HI>Mogol,</HI> but in general, for one <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> there are hundreds of <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Heathen;</HI> which obligeth him, con&s;tant|ly to entertain (for his defence among&s;t &s;o many dome&s;tick and potent Enemies, and again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>&V;sbecks,</HI> his Neighbours) very great Armies, whether in time of Peace or War, as well about his Per&s;on, as in the Field; as well of the People of the Country, <HI>(Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,)</HI> as chiefly <HI>Mogolians,</HI> or at lea&s;t e&s;teemed &s;uch, be|cau&s;e they are White, and <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> which &s;ufficeth at pre&s;ent; his Court being no more now as 'twas at fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting altogether of true <HI>Mogols;</HI> but a mixture of all &s;orts of &s;trangers, <HI>&V;sbecks, Per&s;ians, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> or their Children; but with this di&s;tinction, that the Children of the third or fourth Generation, and that have taken the Brown colour, and the &s;oft humor of the Country, are not &s;o much e&s;teem'd as the new comers; being al&s;o &s;eldom rais'd to publick Offices, but counting them&s;elves happy, if they may &s;erve as &s;imple Hor&s;emen or Foot.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Armies I am now going to give you &s;ome de&s;cription, that thereby know|ing the great Expences, which the <HI>Grand Mogol</HI> is oblig'd to be at, you may the better judge of his true Riches; let us fir&s;t take a view of the Field Militia, he is nece&s;&s;itated to maintain.</P>
<P>The chief thereof are the <HI>Rajas,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Je&s;&s;eignae, Je&s;&s;om&s;eignae,</HI> and many others to whom he allows very great Per&s;ions, to have them always ready with a certain number of <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> e&s;teeming them like <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that is, like other Strangers, and <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Lords; both in the Army, that is always about his per&s;on, and in tho&s;e al&s;o, that are in the Field. The&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> are generally oblig'd to the &s;ame things, that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are, even to the point of keeping Guard; yet with this di&s;tinction, that they keep not the Guard within the Fortre&s;s, as tho&s;e, but without, under their Tents; they not liking to be &s;hut up Twenty four hours in a Fortre&s;s, nor &s;o much as ever to go thither, but well attended with Men, re&s;olute to be cut in pieces for their &s;ervice; as hath appear'd, when they have been ill dealt withal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is oblig'd to keep the&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> in his &s;ervice for &s;undry rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e the Militia of the <HI>Rajas</HI> is very good (as was &s;aid above) and becau&s;e there are <HI>Rajas,</HI> (as was intimated al&s;o) one of whom can bring into the Field above 25000 men.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the better to bridle the other <HI>Rajas,</HI> and to reduce them to rea&s;on when they cantonize, or when they refu&s;e to pay Tribute, or when out of fear or other cau&s;e, they will not go out of their Country to the Army, when the <HI>Mogol</HI> requi|reth it.</P>
<P>The <HI>third,</HI> the better to nouri&s;h jealou&s;ies and keenne&s;s among&s;t them, by favouring and care&s;&s;ing the one more than the other, which is done to that degree, that they proceed to fight with one another very frequently.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth,</HI> to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Patans,</HI> or again&s;t his own <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Go|vernors, in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth,</HI> to employ them again&s;t the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when he refu&s;eth to pay his Tribute, or when he will defend the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>Rajas</HI> his Neighbours, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath a mind to rifle, or to make his Tributaries; the <HI>Mogol</HI> in tho&s;e ca&s;es not daring to tru&s;t his <HI>Omrahs</HI> overmuch, who mo&s;t are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and not of the &s;ame Religion with him, but <HI>Chias,</HI> like the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Golkonda.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all, is, to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> upon occa&s;ion; not daring then al&s;o to confide in his <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who, for the greate&s;t part, as was ju&s;t now &s;aid, are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and con&s;equently have no &s;tomach to fight again&s;t their natural King; and the le&s;s, becau&s;e they believe him to be their <HI>Imam,</HI> their <HI>Caliph</HI> or High Prie&s;t, de&s;cended from <HI>Aly,</HI> and again&s;t whom therefore they be|lieve they cannot make War without a Crime, or a great Sin.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is farther oblig'd to entertain &s;ome <HI>Patans</HI> for the &s;ame, or &s;omewhat like rea&s;ons, that he doth the <HI>Rajas.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t he mu&s;t entertain that &s;tranger Militia of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> that we have taken no|tice of: And as this is the main &s;trength of his State, and which obliges him to incre|dible charges, methinks it will not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe to you, of what nature it is, though I &s;hould be &s;omewhat long in doing it.</P>
<P>Let us therefore con&s;ider, if you plea&s;e, this &s;tranger Militia, both Cavalry and In|fantry, as divided into two; the <HI>one,</HI> being always near the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Per&s;on; the <HI>other,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="368">
di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the &s;everal Provinces. And in the Cavalry that is about his Per&s;on, let us fir&s;t take notice of the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> then, of the <HI>Man&s;ebdars;</HI> next, of the <HI>Rou&s;indars;</HI> la&s;t of all, of the &s;imple Hor&s;emen. From thence let us proceed to the Infantry, in which we &s;hall con&s;ider the Mu&s;quetiers, and all tho&s;e men on foot that at|tend the Ordnance, where &s;omething will occur to be &s;aid of their Artillery.</P>
<P>It is not to be thought, that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court are Sons of great Families, as in <HI>France;</HI> All the Lands of that Empire being the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Propriety, it follows, that there are neither Dutchies, nor Marqui&s;ats, nor any Family rich in Land, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting of its own Income and Patrimony. And often enough they are not &s;o much as <HI>Omrah</HI>'s Sons, becau&s;e the King being Heir of all their E&s;tates, it is con&s;equent that the Hou&s;es cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in their greatne&s;s; on the contrary, they often fall, and that on a &s;udden, in&s;omuch that the Sons, or at lea&s;t the Grand&s;ons of a potent <HI>Omrah</HI> are frequently, after the death of their Father, reduced, in a manner, to Beggary, and oblig'd to li&s;t them&s;elves under &s;ome <HI>Omrah</HI> for &s;imple Hor&s;emen. 'Tis true, that ordinarily the <HI>Mogol</HI> leaves &s;ome &s;mall Pen&s;ion to the Widow, and often al|&s;o to the Children; or, if the Father liveth too long, he may by particular favour ad|vance them &s;ooner, e&s;pecially if they be proper men, white of Face, having as yet not too much of the <HI>Indian</HI> Complexion and temper, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing yet for true <HI>Mogols:</HI> Though this advancement by favour do always proceed in a &s;low pace; it being almo&s;t a general cu&s;tom, that a man mu&s;t pa&s;s from &s;mall Pays and &s;mall Places, to great ones. The&s;e <HI>Omrahs</HI> then are commonly but Adventurers and Strangers of all &s;orts of Nations, &s;uch as I have &s;aid; which draw one another to this Court; men of a mean de&s;cent, &s;ome of them &s;laves; mo&s;t of them without in&s;truction, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> thus rai&s;eth to Dignities as he thinks good, and degrades them again, as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;ome are <HI>Hazary,</HI> others <HI>Dou Hazary,</HI> others <HI>Penge, Hecht,</HI> and <HI>Deh Hazary,</HI> and even (&s;uch was the King's elde&s;t Son) <HI>Dovazdeh Hazary,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Lord of a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, of two thou&s;and, five thou&s;and, &s;even, ten, and twelve thou&s;and; their Pay being le&s;s or more in proportion to the number of Hor&s;es; I &s;ay, of Hor&s;es, becau&s;e they are not paid in re&s;pect of the Hor&s;emen, but of the Hor&s;e; the <HI>Omrahs</HI> having power to entertain Hor&s;emen of two Hor&s;es a man, to be the better able to &s;erve in the hot Countries, where 'tis a common &s;aying, <HI>That the Hor&s;eman that hath but one Hor&s;e, is more than half a Footman.</HI> Yet we mu&s;t not think, that they are oblig'd to entertain, or that the King effectively pays &s;o many Hor&s;e, as the&s;e great names of <HI>Dovazdeh</HI> or <HI>Hecht Hazary</HI> do impart, that is, 12000, or 8000 Hor&s;e. The&s;e are &s;pecious Names, to amu&s;e and attract Strangers; the King determines the number of Hor&s;es in actual &s;ervice, which they are bound to entertain, pays them according to this number; and be&s;ides that, he pays them a certain number which they are not bound to entertain; and this is that which ordinarily makes the principal part of their Pen|&s;ions; not to &s;peak of what they finger out of the Pay of every Hor&s;eman, and of the number of the Hor&s;es; which certainly amounts to very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ions; e&s;pe|cially if they can obtain good <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> that is, good Lands for their Pen&s;ion. For I &s;aw, that the Lord, under whom I was, that was a <HI>Penge-hazary,</HI> or one of five thou|&s;and Hor&s;e, and who was only obliged to entertain five hundred in effect, had, after all his Cavalry was paid, remaining for his Pen&s;ion near Five thou&s;and Crowns a month; though he was <HI>Nagdy,</HI> that is, paid in Mony drawn out of the Trea&s;ury, as all tho&s;e are, that have not Lands. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e great Pen&s;ions, I &s;ee none but very few that are rich, but many that are unea&s;ie and indebted: Not that they are ruin'd by keeping too plentiful Tables, as el&s;ewhere great Lords frequently are; but that which exhau&s;teth them, are the great Pre&s;ents which they are oblig'd to make to the King at certain Fe&s;tivals of the year, every one after the rate of his Pay; next, the va&s;t Expences they mu&s;t be at for entertaining their Wives, Servants, Camels, and ma|ny Hor&s;es of great value, which they keep in their particular Stables.</P>
<P>The number of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> as well of tho&s;e, that are in the Field in the Provinces and Armies, as of tho&s;e that are at the Court, is very great. I never could preci&s;ely learn it; nor is it determined: But I have never &s;een le&s;s of them at Court, than twen|ty five or thirty, that are thus Pen&s;ionaries according to a greater or le&s;&s;er number of Hor&s;es to be entertain'd by them, from 12000 downward to 1000. The&s;e are the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that arrive to the Governments and principal Offices of the Court and Armies; that are, as they &s;peak, the Pillars of the Empire, and that keep up the &s;plendor of the Court; never going abroad, but richly deck'd, &s;ometimes riding on Elephants,
<PB N="67" REF="368">
&s;ometimes on Hor&s;eback, &s;ometimes carried in a <HI>Paleky</HI> or Chair, commonly attended by a good number of Hor&s;emen, to wit, of tho&s;e that have the Guard at that time, as al&s;o by many Footmen marching before, and on his &s;ides, to make way, to drive away the Flies, to take off the du&s;t with Peacocks tails, to carry water for drink, and &s;ome|times Books of Accompts, or other Papers.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e that are at Court, are oblig'd, under a con&s;iderable Penalty, to come twice every day to &s;alute the King in the A&s;&s;embly, once about Ten or eleven a clock in the morning, when he renders Ju&s;tice; and the &s;econd time, about &s;ix hours at night. They are al&s;o oblig'd by turns to keep the Guard in the Ca&s;tle once a week, during twenty four hours. Thither they carry at that time their Beds, Tapi&s;&s;eries and other Moveables, the King furni&s;hing them with nothing but Provi&s;ions of Meat and Drink, which they receive with great reverence, making a treble obei&s;ance, with their face turn'd to his Apartment, their hands down to the ground, and then lifted up upon their heads. Be&s;ides, they are oblig'd on Hor&s;eback to follow the King whither&s;oever he marcheth in any weather, rainy or du&s;ty, whether he be carried in his Chair, or on an Elephant, or a Field-Throne, which la&s;t is done by eight men carrying him on their &s;houlders, eight others marching on his &s;ide, to relieve the others; him&s;elf being in all Marches well cover'd from the inconveniencies of the Weather, whether he go to War, or to Hunt, or to exerci&s;e his Soldiery. And this attendance tho&s;e <HI>Omrahs</HI> are to give, except &s;ome of them be exempted by the <HI>Mogol,</HI> becau&s;e of their peculiar Of|fices, or upon the account of &s;ickne&s;s or old age, or to avoid embara&s;ment, as com|monly 'tis practi&s;ed, when he goeth only to &s;ome neighbouring Town to hunt, or to &s;ome hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, or to the Mo&s;quee, there being then &s;eldom any about him but tho&s;e that keep the Guard that day.</P>
<P><HI>Man&s;ebdars</HI> are Cavaliers <HI>Man&s;eb,</HI> which is particular and honourable Pay; not &s;o great indeed as that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> but much greater than that of the others; they being e&s;teemed as little <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and of the rank of tho&s;e, that are rai&s;ed to that dig|nity.</P>
<P>The&s;e acknowledge al&s;o none for their Head but the King, and they are generally ob|liged to whatever we have &s;aid the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are. In a word, they would be true <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> if they had, as divers heretofore have had, &s;ome Hor&s;emen under them; whereas they have ordinarily but two, four, or &s;ix Hor&s;es, having the King's mark, and their Pay goes no higher than from 200, to 600 or 700 <HI>Roupies</HI> a month. Their number al|&s;o is not fixed, but much exceeds that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> there being of them at the Court always two or three hundred, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are in the Provinces and Ar|mies.</P>
<P><HI>Rouzindars</HI> are al&s;o a &s;ort of Cavaliers, but &s;uch as have their Pay by the day, (as the word it &s;elf imports) which yet &s;ometimes is greater than that of many <HI>Man&s;eb|dars,</HI> but not &s;o honourable; but then they are not bound, as the <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> to take at a &s;et price (which &s;ometimes is not too rea&s;onable) of tho&s;e Tapi&s;&s;eries and other Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, that hath &s;erv'd for the King's Palace. Their number is very great; they enter into the meaner Offices, many of them being Clerks, Under-Clerks, Signet-Men, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Simple Cavaliers,</HI> are tho&s;e, that are under the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> among&s;t whom the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and having mo&s;t Pay, are tho&s;e that have two Hor&s;es marked on the Leg with the mark of their <HI>Omrah.</HI> Their Pay is not ab&s;olutely fixed, but depends chiefly from the genero&s;ity of the <HI>Omrah,</HI> who may favour whom he plea&s;eth. Yet the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s intention is, that the Pay of a &s;imple Cavalier or Hor&s;eman be no le&s;s than twenty five <HI>Roupies,</HI> or thereabout a Month, &s;tating his account with the <HI>Omrahs</HI> upon that Foot.</P>
<P>The Pay of the Foot is the lea&s;t; and their Mu&s;quetiers are pitiful men, unle&s;s they di&s;charge when their Mu&s;quet leans on that &s;mall wooden Fork hanging to it; yet even then they are afraid of &s;ingeing their great Beards, and of burning their Eyes, but mo&s;t of all, lea&s;t &s;ome <HI>Dgen</HI> or evil Spirit bur&s;t their Mu&s;quet. Some of the&s;e have 20 <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month, &s;ome 15, &s;ome 10. But yet there are &s;ome Gunners that have great Pay, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the <HI>Franguis</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as <HI>Portugue&s;es, Engli&s;h, Dutch, Ger|mans, French,</HI> that retire thither from <HI>Goa,</HI> flying from <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Companies. Heretofore when the <HI>Mogols</HI> did not yet know how to manage Artillery, their Pay was very great. And there are yet &s;ome of that time, who have 200 <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month; but now they will receive none for more than thirty two.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="369">
Their Artillery is of two &s;orts; the one is the great and heavy Artillery, the other the light. As for the former, I remember, that when the King after his Sickne&s;s went with his whole Army abroad into the Country, diverting him&s;elf every day in Hunt|ing, &s;ometimes of Cranes, &s;ometimes of the gray Oxen, (a kind of Elks) &s;ometimes of Gazels, Leopards and Lions, and making his progre&s;s towards <HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Kach|mire</HI> (that little Paradi&s;e of <HI>India)</HI> there to pa&s;s the Summer, the Army had Seventy pieces of Cannon, mo&s;t of them ca&s;t, not counting the two or three hundred Camels, carrying each a &s;mall Field-piece of the bigne&s;s of a good double Mu&s;quet, fa&s;tned to tho&s;e Animals. The other light Artillery is very brave and well order'd, con&s;i&s;ting of fifty or &s;ixty &s;mall Field-pieces all of Bra&s;s, each mounted on a little Chariot, drawn by two very fair Hor&s;es, driven by a Coachman like a <HI>Caleche,</HI> adorned with a number of &s;mall red Streamers, each having a third Hor&s;e led by the Chariot for relief.</P>
<P>The great Artillery could not always follow the King, who often l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t the Highway, and turn'd &s;ometimes to the right, &s;ometimes to the left hand, cro&s;&s;ing the fields, to find the true places for Game, and to follow the cour&s;e of the Rivers. <HI>That</HI> therefore was to keep the Highway to go the more ea&s;ily, and to avoid the embara&s;ments, which it would have met with in the ill pa&s;&s;ages, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Boat-Bridges made to pa&s;s Rivers. The light Artillery is in&s;eparable from the per&s;on of the King, it marcheth away in the morning, when the King comes out of his Tent; and whereas he com|monly goes a little a&s;ide into the places for Game, this Artillery pa&s;&s;eth on &s;traight with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, to be in time at the Rendezvous, and there to appear before the King's Tent, which is there made ready the day before; as are al&s;o the Tents of the great <HI>Omrahs:</HI> And this whole Artillery giveth a Volley ju&s;t when the King enters into his Tent, thereby to give notice to the Army of his arrival.</P>
<P>The Militia of the Field is not different from that which is about the King: There are everywhere <HI>Omrahs, Man&s;ebdars, Rou&s;indars,</HI> &s;imple Hor&s;emen, and Foot and Ar|tillery where-ever any War is made. The difference is only in the number, which is much greater in the Field-Army, than in the other. For that Army alone, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> is con&s;train'd perpetually to maintain in <HI>Decan,</HI> to bridle the potent King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and to make War upon the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and upon all the <HI>Raja's</HI> that join with him, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t at lea&s;t of twenty, or twenty five thou&s;and Hor&s;e &s;ometimes of thirty.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Kaboul,</HI> for its ordinary Guard again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians, Augans, Ba|louches,</HI> and I know not how many Mounteniers, requireth at lea&s;t Fifteen thou&s;and. The Kingdom of <HI>Kachmire,</HI> more than Four thou&s;and; and the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> much more; not counting tho&s;e that are employ'd in the War, which mu&s;t almo&s;t al|ways be maintain'd on that &s;ide; nor tho&s;e which the Governors of the &s;everal Provin|ces do need for their defence, according to the particular extent and &s;ituation of their Governments, which maketh an incredible number.</P>
<P>Not to mention the Infantry, (which is incon&s;iderable) I am apt to believe with many others, well inform'd of the&s;e matters, that the number of the Hor&s;e in actual &s;er|vice about the King's Per&s;on, comprehending the Cavalry of the <HI>Raja's</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> mounteth to Thirty five or forty thou&s;and; and that this number, joined to tho&s;e that is abroad in the Field, may make Two hundred thou&s;and, and better.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, that the Infantry is incon&s;iderable; for I can hardly believe, that in the Army which is about the King, compri&s;ing the Mu&s;quetiers, and all the Gunners and their Mates, and whatever &s;erves in this Artillery, can amount to much more than Fifteen thou&s;and; whence you may make a near gue&s;s, what the number of the Foot mu&s;t be in the Field. So that I know not whence to take that prodigious number of Foot, which &s;ome do reckon in the Armies of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> unle&s;s it be, that with this true Soldiery they confound all the Serving-men and Victuallers that follow the Army; for in that &s;en&s;e I &s;hould ea&s;ily believe, that they had rea&s;on to reckon two or three hun|dred thou&s;and men in that Army alone which is with the King, and &s;ometimes more; e&s;pecially when 'tis certain, that he is to be long ab&s;ent from the Capital City: which will not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to him, that con&s;iders the multitude and confu&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Kit|chens, Baggage, Women, Elephants, Camels, Oxen, Hor&s;es, Waiting-men, Porters, Fora|gers, Victuallers, Merchants of all &s;orts, that mu&s;t follow the Army; nor to him, that knows the State and particular Government of that Country, wherein the King is the &s;ole Proprietor of all the Lands of the Kingdom; whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that a whole Metropolitan City, &s;uch as <HI>Dehly</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> liveth of almo&s;t nothing but of the
<PB N="69" REF="369">
Soldiery, and is con&s;equently oblig'd to follow the King when he taketh the Field; tho&s;e Towns being nothing le&s;s than <HI>Paris,</HI> but indeed no otherwi&s;e govern'd than a Camp of Armies a little better and more conveniently lodg'd than in the open Field.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e things, you may al&s;o con&s;ider, if you plea&s;e, that generally all this Militia, which I have been repre&s;enting to you, from the greate&s;t <HI>Omrah,</HI> to the meane&s;t Soldier, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly paid every two months, the King's Pay being its &s;ole refuge and relief; nor can its Pay be deferred there, as 'tis &s;ometimes with us; where, when there are pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions of the State, a Gentleman, an Officer, and even a &s;imple Cavalier, can &s;tay awhile, and maintain him&s;elf of his own Stock, Rents, and the In|comes of his Land. But in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Country, all mu&s;t be paid at the time prefix'd, or all disbands and &s;tarves, after they have &s;old that little they have; as I &s;aw in this la&s;t War, that many were going to do, if it had not &s;oon cea&s;ed. And this the more, becau&s;e that in all this Militia, there is almo&s;t no Soldier that hath not Wife and Chil|dren, Servants and Slaves, that look for this Pay, and have no other hope of relief. And hence it is&punc; that many wonder, con&s;idering the huge number of per&s;ons living of Pay (which amounts to millions) whence &s;uch va&s;t Revenues can be had for &s;uch ex|ce&s;&s;ive Charges: Although this need not to be &s;o much wondred at, con&s;idering the Riches of the Empire, the peculiar Government of the State, and the &s;aid univer&s;al Propriety of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>You may add to all this, That the <HI>Grand Mogol</HI> keeps nigh him at <HI>Dehly</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and thereabout, two or three thou&s;and brave Hor&s;es, to be always ready upon occa&s;ion, as al&s;o eight or nine hundred Elephants, and a va&s;t number of Mules, Hor&s;es, and Por|ters, to carry all the great Tents and their Cabinets, to carry his Wives, Kitchens, Hou|&s;hold-&s;tuff, <HI>Ganges</HI>-Water, and all the other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Field, which he hath always about him as if he were at home; things not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in our King|doms.</P>
<P>To this may be added tho&s;e incredible Expences upon the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> more indi&s;pen|&s;ible than will be ea&s;ily believ'd; that va&s;t &s;tore of fine Linnen, Cloth of Gold, Em|broideries, Silks, Musk, Amber, Pearls, &s;weet E&s;&s;ences, &amp;c. con&s;umed there.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Charges being put together, and compar'd with the Revenues the <HI>Mogol</HI> may be thought to have, it will be ea&s;ie to judge, whether he be indeed &s;o very rich, as he is made to be. As for me, I very well know, that it cannot be denied, that he hath very great Revenues; I believe, he hath more alone than the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> and the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> both together: But then, to believe all tho&s;e extravagant Stories made of the va&s;tne&s;s of his Revenues, is a thing I could never do: And if I &s;hould believe the be&s;t part of them, yet &s;hould I not believe him in effect and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o rich, as the World rings of him; unle&s;s a man would &s;ay, that a Trea&s;urer, who receiveth great Sums of mony from one hand at the &s;ame time when he is oblig'd to disbur&s;e them to another, were therefore truly rich. For my part, I &s;hould count that King rich indeed, who, without oppre&s;&s;ing and impoveri&s;hing his People too much, &s;hould have a Re|venue &s;ufficient to keep a great and gallant Court, (after the manner of that of ours, or otherwi&s;e) and a Militia &s;ufficient both to guard his Kingdom, and to make an impor|tant War for divers years again&s;t his Neighbours; as al&s;o to &s;hew Liberality, to build &s;ome Royal Edifices, and to make tho&s;e other Expences which Kings are wont to make according to their particular Inclinations; and who, be&s;ides all this, &s;hould be able to put up in his Trea&s;ury, for a Re&s;erve, Sums big enough to undertake and maintain a good War for &s;ome years. Now I am apt enough to believe, that the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> enjoyeth very near the&s;e Advantages, but I cannot per&s;wade my &s;elf, that he hath them in that exce&s;s, as is thought and pretended. Tho&s;e va&s;t and inevitable Expences, that I have taken notice of, will certainly incline you to my Opinion without any other con|&s;ideration; but you will, doubtle&s;s, be altogether of my mind, when I &s;hall have repre|&s;ented to you the&s;e two things, which I am very well informed of.</P>
<P>The <HI>one</HI> is, that the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> now reigning, about the end of this la&s;t Revolu|tion, though the Kingdom was everywhere in peace (except in <HI>Bengale,</HI> where <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eld out) was much perplexed where to find means for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his Armies, though they were not &s;o well paid as at other times, and the War la&s;ted no longer than five years, or threabout, and though al&s;o he had laid hold of a good part of the Trea&s;ury of his Father <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> is, That all this Trea&s;ure of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who was very frugal, and had Reigned above Forty years without con&s;iderable Wars, never mounted to &s;ix <HI>Kourours</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="370">
of <HI>Roupies.</HI> A <HI>Roupy</HI> is about twenty nine pence. An hundred thou&s;and of them make a <HI>Lecque,</HI> and an hundred <HI>Lecques</HI> make one <HI>Kourour. [So that the &s;ix</HI> Kourours <HI>would make about &s;even Millions and an half</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Money.]</HI> 'Tis true, I do not compre|hend in this great Trea&s;ure that great abundance of Gold&s;miths work, &s;o variou&s;ly wrought in Gold and Silver; nor that va&s;t &s;tore of precious Stones and Pearls of a very high value. I doubt, whether there be any King in the World that hath more. The Throne alone, cover'd with them, is valu'd at lea&s;t three <HI>Kourors,</HI> if I remember aright: But then, it is to be con&s;ider'd al&s;o, that they are the &s;poils of tho&s;e ancient Princes, the <HI>Patans</HI> and <HI>Rajas,</HI> gather'd and piled up from immemorial times, and &s;till increa&s;ing from one King to another, by the Pre&s;ents which the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are obliged year|ly at certain Fe&s;tival-days to make him; and which are e&s;teemed to be the Jewels of the Crown, which it would be criminal to touch, and upon which a King of <HI>Mogol</HI> in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity would find it very hard to procure the lea&s;t Sum.</P>
<P>But before I conclude, I &s;hall take notice, whence it may proceed, that though this Empire of <HI>Mogol</HI> be thus an Aby&s;s of Gold and Silver, (as hath been &s;aid,) yet not|with&s;tanding there appears no more of it among the people, than el&s;ewhere; yea, ra|ther that the People is there le&s;s Monied than in other places.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> rea&s;on is, that much of it is con&s;umed in melting over and over all tho&s;e No&s;e and Ear-rings, Chains, Finger-rings, Bracelets of Hands and Feet, which the Women wear, but chiefly in that incredible quantity of Manufactures, wherein &s;o much is &s;pent, which is lo&s;t, as in all tho&s;e Embroideries, Silk-&s;tuffs, enterwoven with Gold and Sil|ver, Cloth, Scarf, Turbants, &amp;c. of the &s;ame. For generally all that Militia loveth to be guided from the <HI>Omrahs</HI> to the meane&s;t Soldiers with their Wives and Children, though they &s;hould &s;tarve at home.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That all the Lands of the Kingdom being the Kings propriety, they are given either as Benefices, which they call <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> or, as in <HI>Turky, Timars,</HI> to men of the Militia for their Pay or Pen&s;ion (as the word <HI>Jah-ghir</HI> imports:) Or el&s;e they are given to the Governours for their Pen&s;ion, and the entertainment of their Troops, on condition that of the &s;urplus of tho&s;e Land-revenues they give yearly a certain &s;um to the King, as Farmers; Or la&s;tly, the King re&s;erveth them for him&s;elf as a particu|lar Domaine of his Hou&s;e, which never or very &s;eldom are given as <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> and upon which he keeps Farmers, who al&s;o mu&s;t give him a yearly &s;um; which is to &s;ay, that the <HI>Timariots, Governours</HI> and <HI>Farmers</HI> have an ab&s;olute Authority over the Country-men, and even a very great one over the Trade&s;men and Merchants of the Towns, Boroughs, and Villages, depending from them: &s;o that in tho&s;e Parts there are neither great Lords nor Parliaments, nor Pre&s;idial Courts, as among&s;t us, to keep the&s;e People in awe: nor <HI>Kadis</HI> or Judges, powerful enough to hinder and repre&s;s their violence; Nor, in a word, any per&s;on, to whom a Country-man, Trade&s;-man, or Merchant, can make his complaints to, in ca&s;es of extortion and tyranny, often practi|&s;ed upon them, by the Soldiery and Governors, who every where do impunely abu&s;e the Authority Royal, which they have in hand, unle&s;s it be perhaps a little in tho&s;e pla|ces that are near to Capital Cities, as <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and in great Towns and con&s;i|derable Sea-ports of the Provinces, whence they know that the complaints can be more ea&s;ily conveyed to the Court. Whence it is, that all and every one &s;tand in con|tinual fear of the&s;e people, e&s;pecially of the Governors more than any Slave doth of his Ma&s;ter: that ordinarily they affect to appear poor and money-le&s;s, very mean in their Apparel, Lodging, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, and yet more in meat and drink; that often they apprehend even to meddle with Trade, le&s;t they &s;hould be thought Rich, and &s;o fall into the danger of being ruined: So that at la&s;t they find no other remedy to &s;e|cure their Wealth, than to hide and dig their money deep under Ground, thus getting out of the ordinary commerce of men, and &s;o Dying, neither the King nor the State having any benefit by it. Which is a thing not only happens among the Pea|&s;ants and Artizans, but (which is far more con&s;iderable) among&s;t all &s;orts of Mer|chants, whether <HI>Mabumetans</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> except &s;ome that are in the Kings, or &s;ome <HI>Omrahs</HI> Pay, or that have &s;ome particular Patron and &s;upport in power: But principally among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> which are almo&s;t the only Ma&s;ters of the Trade and Money, infatuated with the belief, that the Gold and Silver, which they hide in their life-time, &s;hall &s;erve them after death. And this, in my opinion, is the true rea&s;on, why there appears &s;o little money in Trade among the People.</P>
<P>But thence ari&s;eth a Que&s;tion very con&s;iderable, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether it were not more expe|dient,
<PB N="71" REF="370">
not only for the Subjects, but for the State it &s;elf, and for the Sovereign, not to have the Prince &s;uch a Proprietor of the Lands of the Kingdom, as to take away the <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> among&s;t private per&s;ons; as 'tis with us; For my part, after a &s;trict comparing the State of our Kingdoms, where that <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> holds, with that of tho&s;e other Kingdoms, where it is not, I am thoroughly per&s;waded, that it is much better and more beneficial for the Sovereign him&s;elf, to have it &s;o as 'tis in our parts. Becau&s;e that in tho&s;e parts where 'tis otherwi&s;e, the Gold and Silver is lo&s;t, as I was ju&s;t now ob&s;erving: There is almo&s;t no per&s;on &s;ecure from the violences of tho&s;e Timariors, Governours, and Farmers: The Kings, how well &s;oever they be di&s;|po&s;ed toward their people, are never almo&s;t in a condition (as I lately noted) to get Ju&s;tice admini&s;tred to them, and to hinder tyrannies; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e great Domini|ons, and in the Provinces remote from the Capital Towns; Which yet ought to be, as doubtle&s;s it is, one of the chief employments and con&s;iderations of a King. Be&s;ides, this tyranny often grows to that exce&s;s, that it takes away what is nece&s;&s;ary to the life of a Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;man, who is &s;tarved for hunger and mi&s;ery; who gets no Chil|dren, or if he does, &s;ees them die young for want of food; or that abandons his Land, and turns &s;ome Cavalier's man, or flies whither he may to his Neighbours, in hopes of finding a better condition. In a word, the Land is not tilled but almo&s;t by force, and con&s;equently very ill, and much of it is quite &s;poiled and ruined, there being none to be found, that can or will be at the charge of entertaining the ditches and channels for the cour&s;e of waters to be convey'd to nece&s;&s;ary places; nor any body that care to build Hou&s;es, or to repair tho&s;e that are ruinous; the Pea&s;ant rea&s;oning thus with him|&s;elf: Why &s;hould I toil &s;o much for a Tyrant that may come to morrow to take all away from me, or at lea&s;t all the be&s;t of what I have, and not leave, if the fancy taketh him, &s;o much as to &s;u&s;tain my life even very poorly? And the Timariot, the Governor and the Farmer, will rea&s;on thus with him&s;elf; Why &s;hould I be&s;tow mony, and take pains of bettering or maintaining this Land, &s;ince I mu&s;t every hour expect to have it taken from me, or exchanged for another? I labour neither for my &s;elf, nor for my Chil|dren; and that place which I have this year, I may, perhaps, have no more the next. Let us draw from it what we can, whil&s;t we po&s;&s;e&s;s it, though the Pea&s;ant &s;hould break or &s;tarve, though the Land &s;hould become a De&s;art, when I am gone!</P>
<P>And for this very rea&s;on it is, that we &s;ee tho&s;e va&s;t E&s;tates in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> go &s;o wretchedly and palpably to ruine. Thence it is, that throughout tho&s;e Parts we &s;ee almo&s;t no other Towns but made up of earth and dirt; nothing but ruin'd and de&s;erted Towns and Villages, or &s;uch as are going to ruine. Even thence it is, that we &s;ee (for Ex|ample) tho&s;e <HI>Me&s;opotamia's, Anatolia's, Pale&s;tina's,</HI> tho&s;e admirable Plains of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and &s;o many other Lands, anciently &s;o well tilled, &s;o fertile, and &s;o well peopled, at the pre&s;ent half de&s;erted, untill'd and bandon'd, or become pe&s;tilent and uninhabitable Bogs. Thence it is al&s;o, that of tho&s;e incomparable Lands of <HI>Egypt</HI> it is ob&s;erv'd, that within le&s;s than <HI>four&s;core</HI> years, more than the <HI>tenth</HI> part of it is lo&s;t, no people being to be found, that will expend what is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain all the Channels, and to re&s;train the River <HI>Nile</HI> from violently overflowing on one hand, and &s;o drowning too much the low Lands, or from covering them with Sand, which cannot be remov'd from thence but with great pains and charges. From the &s;ame root it comes, that Arts are langui&s;hing in tho&s;e Countries, or at lea&s;t flouri&s;h much le&s;s than el&s;e they would do, or do with Us. For what heart and &s;pirit can an Artizan have to &s;tudy well, and to apply his mind to his work, when he &s;ees, that among the people, which is for the mo&s;t part beggarly, or will appear &s;o, there is none that con&s;iders the goodne&s;s and neatne&s;s of his Work, every body looking for what is cheap, and that the Grandees pay them but very ill, and when they plea&s;e. The poor Trade&s;man often thinking him&s;elf happy, that he can get clear from them without the <HI>Korrah,</HI> which is that terrible Whip that hangs nigh the Gate of the <HI>Omrahs.</HI> Further, when he &s;eeth that there is no help at all ever to come to any thing, as to buy an Office, or &s;ome Land for him&s;elf and Chil|dren, and that even he dares not appear to have a Penny in Ca&s;h, or to wear good Cloaths, or to eat a good Meal, for fear he &s;hould be thought rich. And indeed the beauty and exactne&s;s of Arts had been quite lo&s;t in tho&s;e Parts long ago, if it were not that the Kings and Grandees there did give Wages to certain Workmen, that work in their Hou&s;es, and there teach their Children, and endeavour to make them&s;elves able in order to be a little more con&s;ider'd, and to e&s;cape the <HI>Korrah;</HI> and if al&s;o it were not, that tho&s;e great and rich Merchants of Towns, who are protected by good and
<PB N="72" REF="371">
powerful Patrons, pay'd tho&s;e Workmen a little better; I &s;ay, <HI>a little Better;</HI> for, what fine &s;tuffs &s;oever we &s;ee come from tho&s;e Countries, we mu&s;t not imagine, that the Workman is there in any honour, or comes to any thing; 'tis nothing but meer Nece&s;&s;ity, or the Cudgel, that makes him work, he never grows rich; it is no &s;mall matter, when he hath wherewith to live, and to cloath him&s;elf narrowly. If there be any mony to gain of the Work, that is not for him, but for tho&s;e great Merchants of Towns, I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of; and even the&s;e them&s;elves find it often difficult enough to maintain them&s;elves, and to prevent Extortion.</P>
<P>'Tis from the &s;ame cau&s;e al&s;o, that a gro&s;s and profound Ignorance reigns in tho&s;e States. For, how is it po&s;&s;ible, there &s;hould be Academies and Colleges well founded, where are &s;uch Founders to be met with? And if there were any, Whence were the Scholars to be had? Where are tho&s;e that have means &s;ufficient to maintain their Chil|dren in Colleges? And if there were, who would appear to be &s;o rich? And if they would, Where are tho&s;e Benefices, Preferments, and Dignities, that require Knowledg and Abilities, and that may animate young men to &s;tudy?</P>
<P>Thence it is likewi&s;e, that Traffick langui&s;hes in all that Country, in compari&s;on of ours. For how many are there, that care to take pains, to run up and down, to write much, and to run danger for another, for a Governor, that &s;hall extort, if he be not in league with &s;ome con&s;iderable Sword-man, who&s;e Slave he in a manner is, and that makes his own Conditions with him?</P>
<P>It is not there, that the Kings find for their &s;ervice, Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, Sons of rich and good Families, Officers, Citizens, Merchants, and even Trade&s;men, well born, well educated, and well in&s;tructed; men of Courage, that have a true affection and re&s;pect for their King, that often live a great while at the Court, and in the Army, at their own Expences, entertaining them&s;elves with good hopes, and content with the favourable a&s;pect of the Prince; and who, upon occa&s;ion, fight manfully, covetous to uphold the honour of their Ance&s;tors and Families. Tho&s;e Kings, I &s;ay, never &s;ee about them, but men of nothing, Slaves, Ignorants, Brutes, and &s;uch Courtizans as are rai&s;ed from the Du&s;t to Dignities; and that for want of good Education and In&s;tru|ction, almo&s;t always retain &s;omewhat of their Off&s;pring, of the temper of Beggars, en|riched, proud, un&s;ufferable, heartle&s;s, in&s;en&s;ible of honour, di&s;ingenuous, and void of affection and regard for the honour of their King and Country. Here it is, where tho&s;e Kings mu&s;t ruine all, to find means to defray all tho&s;e prodigious Charges, which they cannot avoid for entertaining their great Court, which hath no other &s;ource to &s;ub&s;i&s;t but their Coffers and Trea&s;ure, and for maintaining con&s;tantly the va&s;t number of Sol|diers, nece&s;&s;ary for them to keep the People in &s;ubjection, to prevent their running away, to make them work, and to get what is exacted from them, they being &s;o many De&s;perado's, for being perpetually under hatches, and for labouring only for others.</P>
<P>Thence it is al&s;o, that in an important War that may happen (which may be almo&s;t at all times) they mu&s;t almo&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ell the Government for ready Mony, and immen&s;e Sums, whence chiefly that ruine and defolation comes to pa&s;s which we &s;ee. For the Governor, which is the Buyer, mu&s;t not he be re-imbur&s;ed of all tho&s;e great Sums of mony, which he hath taken up, perhaps the third or fourth part, at high in|tere&s;t? Mu&s;t not a Governor al&s;o, whether he have bought the Government or not, find means as well as a Timariot and a Farmer, to make every year great Pre&s;ents to a <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> an <HI>Eunuch,</HI> a Lady of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and to tho&s;e other per&s;ons that &s;upport him at Court? Mu&s;t he not pay to the King his u&s;ual Tributes, and withal enrich him&s;elf, that wretched Slave, half fami&s;h'd, and deeply indebted when he fir&s;t appear'd, without Goods, Lands, and Revenues of his Hou&s;e, &s;uch as they all are. Do not they ruine all, and lay all wa&s;te? I mean&punc;tho&s;e, that in the Provinces are like &s;o many &s;mall Tyrants with a boundle&s;s and unmea&s;ur'd Authority, there being no body there, as hath been already &s;aid, that can re&s;train them, or to whom a Subject can have refuge, to &s;ave him|&s;elf from their Tyranny, and to obtain Ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in the Empire of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> the <HI>Vakea-nevis,</HI> that is, tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom he &s;ends into the Provinces to write to him whatever pa&s;&s;eth there, do a little keep the Officers in awe, provided they do not collude together (as it almo&s;t always happens) to devour all; as al&s;o that the Governments are not there &s;o often &s;old, nor &s;o openly as in <HI>Turky;</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>not &s;o openly</HI> (for tho&s;e great Pre&s;ents, they are from time to time obliged to make, are almo&s;t equivalent to Sales) and that the Governors ordi|narily remain longer in their Governments; which maketh them not &s;o hungry, &s;o beg|garly,

<P>'Tis al&s;o true, that in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Governments are not &s;o frequently nor &s;o publickly &s;old as in <HI>Turky;</HI> the Sons of the Governors al&s;o &s;ucceeding often enough to their Fa|thers; which is al&s;o the cau&s;e, that the people there is often not &s;o ill treated as in <HI>Turky,</HI> and occa&s;ions withal, that there is more politene&s;s, and that even &s;ome there are that addict them&s;elves to &s;tudy. But all that is really but a &s;light matter; tho&s;e three States of <HI>Turky, Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> fora&s;much as they have all three taken away the <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> as to Land, and propriety of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions (which is the foundation of whatever is good and regular in the World) cannot but very near re&s;emble one ano|ther: they have the &s;ame defect, they mu&s;t at la&s;t, &s;ooner or later, needs fall into the &s;ame inconveniencies, which are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of it, <HI>viz.</HI> Tyranny, Ruine, and De&s;olation.</P>
<P>Far be it therefore, that our Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould thus be Proprietors of all the Lands which their Subjects po&s;&s;e&s;s. Their Kingdoms would be very far from be|ing &s;o well cultivated and peopled, &s;o well built, &s;o rich, &s;o polite and flouri&s;hing as we &s;ee them. Our Kings are otherwi&s;e rich and powerful; and we mu&s;t avow that we are much better and more royally &s;erved. There would be Kings of De&s;arts and Solitudes, of Beggars and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> &s;uch as tho&s;e are whom I have been repre&s;ent|ing; who, becau&s;e they will have all, at la&s;t lo&s;e all; and who, becau&s;e they will make them&s;elves too rich, at length find them&s;elves without riches, or, at lea&s;t, very far from that which they covet after, out of their blind Ambition and Pa&s;&s;ion, of be|ing more ab&s;olute than the Laws of God and Nature do permit. For, where would be tho&s;e Princes, tho&s;e Prelates, tho&s;e Nobles, tho&s;e rich Citizens, and great Merchants, and tho&s;e famous Artizans, tho&s;e Towns of <HI>Paris, Lyons, Thoulou&s;e, Rouen, London,</HI> and &s;o many others? Where would be that infinite number of Burroughs and Villages, all tho&s;e fair Country-hou&s;es and Fields, and Hillocks, tilled and maintained with &s;o much Indu&s;try, Care and Labour? And where would con&s;equently be all tho&s;e va&s;t Revenues drawn thence, which at la&s;t enrich the Subjects and the Sovereign both? We &s;hould find the great Cities, and the great Boroughs rendred inhabitable, becau&s;e of the ill Air, and to fall to ruine without any bodies taking care of repairing them; the Hil|locks abandoned, and the Fields over&s;pread with the Bu&s;hes, or filled with pe&s;tilential Mari&s;hes, as hath been already intimated.</P>
<P>A word to our dear and experienc'd Travellers: They would not find tho&s;e fair con|veniencies of Travelling; they would be obliged to carry all things with them, like the <HI>Bohemians;</HI> and all tho&s;e good Inns, for example, that are found between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lyons,</HI> would be like ten or twelve wretched <HI>Caravans-&s;errahs,</HI> that is, great Barns, rai|&s;ed and paved, &s;uch as our <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> is, where hundreds of men are found pel-mel to|gether with their Hor&s;es, Mules and Camels, where one is &s;tifled with heat in Summer, and &s;tarved of cold in Winter, if it were not for the breathing of tho&s;e Animals, that warm the place a little.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, we &s;ee &s;ome States, where the <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> is not, (as for example, that of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> vvhich vve knovv better than any, vvithout go|ing &s;o far as the <HI>Indies)</HI> that do not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but are al&s;o very povverful, and en|crea&s;e daily.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that that State of the <HI>Gr. Seignior,</HI> of &s;uch a prodigious Extent as it is, having &s;o va&s;t a quantity of Lands, the Soil of which is &s;o excellent, that it cannot be de&s;troyed but very difficultly, and in a long time, is yet rich and populous; but it is certain al&s;o, that if it were cultivated and peopled proportionably to ours&punc; (which it would be, if there were propriety among the Subjects throughout) it would be a quite different thing; it would have people enough to rai&s;e &s;uch prodigious Armies as in old times, and rich enough to maintain them. We have travelled through almo&s;t all the parts of it; we have &s;een how &s;trangely it is ruined and unpeopled; and how in the Capital City there now need three whole months to rai&s;e five or &s;ix thou&s;and men. We know al&s;o, what it would have come to ere this, if it had not been for the great number of Chri&s;tian Slaves that are brought into it from all Parts. And no doubt but that, if the &s;ame Government were continued there for a number of years, that State would de|&s;troy it &s;elf, and at la&s;t, fall it by its ovvn Weakne&s;s, as it &s;eems that already it is hard|ly maintained but only by that means, I mean, by the frequent change of Governors;
<PB N="74" REF="372">
there being not one Governor, nor any one man in the vvhole Empire, that hath a penny to enable him to maintain the lea&s;t thing, or that can almo&s;t find any men, if he had money. A &s;trange manner to make States to &s;ub&s;i&s;t! There vvould need no more for making an end of the Seditions, than a <HI>Brama</HI> of <HI>Pegu,</HI> who killed the half of the Kingdom with hunger, and turned it into Fore&s;ts, hindring for &s;ome years the Lands from being tilled, though yet he hath not &s;ucceeded in his De&s;ign, and the State have afterwards been divided, and that even lately <HI>Ava,</HI> the Capital Town, was upon the point of being taken by an handful of <HI>China</HI> Fugitives. Mean time we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that we are not like to &s;ee in our days that total ruine and de&s;truction of this Empire we are &s;peaking of, (if &s;o be we &s;ee not &s;omething wor&s;e) becau&s;e it hath Neighbors, that are &s;o far from being able to undertake any thing again&s;t him, that they are not &s;o much as in a condition to re&s;i&s;t him, unle&s;s it be by tho&s;e &s;uccours of &s;trangers, which the remotene&s;s and jealou&s;ie would make &s;low, &s;mall, and &s;u&s;pect.</P>
<P>But it might be yet further objected, that it appears not, why &s;uch States as the&s;e might not have good Laws, and why the People in the Provinces might not be enabled to come and make their Complaints to a Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> or to the King him&s;elf. 'Tis true, that they are not altogether de&s;titute of good Laws, and that, if tho&s;e which are among&s;t them were ob&s;erved, there would be as good living there, as in any part of the World. But what are tho&s;e Laws good for, if they be not ob&s;erved, and if there be no means to make them to be executed? Is it not the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> or the King that appoints for the People &s;uch beggarly Tyrants, and that hath no others to &s;et over them? Is it not He that &s;ells tho&s;e Governments? Hath a poor Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;man means to make great Journies, and to come and &s;eek for Ju&s;tice in the Capital City, re|mote, perhaps, 150 or 200 Leagues from the place of his Abode? Will not the Go|vernor cau&s;e him to be made away in his journy (as it hath often hapned) or catch him &s;ooner or later? And will he not provide his Friends at Court, to &s;upport him there, and to repre&s;ent things quite otherwi&s;e than they are? In a word, this Governor, hungry as well as the Timariots and Farmers (that are all men for drawing Oyl out of Sand, as the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;peaks, and for ruining a World, with their heap of Women-har|pies, Children and Slaves) this Governor, I &s;ay, is he not the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, the Superintendant of Ju&s;tice, the Parliament, the Receiver, and all?</P>
<P>It may perhaps be added, That the Lands, which our Kings hold in <HI>Domaine,</HI> are no le&s;s well tilled and peopled, than other Land. But there is a great difference between the having in propriety &s;ome Lands here and there in a great Kingdom (which changes not the Con&s;titution of the State and Government) and the having them all in pro|priety, which would alter it altogether. And then we in the&s;e Parts have Laws &s;o ra|tional, which our Kings are willing to be the fir&s;t to ob&s;erve, and according to which they will that their particular Lands &s;hall be governed as tho&s;e of their Subjects are, &s;o as to give way, that Actions of Law may be laid again&s;t their own Farmers and Offi|cers, &s;o that a Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;man may have means to obtain Ju&s;tice, and to find remedy again&s;t the unju&s;t violence of tho&s;e that would oppre&s;s him: Whereas in tho&s;e Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> I &s;ee almo&s;t not any refuge for tho&s;e poor People; the Cudgel and the Hammer of the Governor being in a manner the only Law that rules, and decides all Controver&s;ies there.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It may be &s;aid, that 'tis at lea&s;t certain, that in &s;uch States there is not &s;uch a multitude of long-la&s;ting Suits of Law, as in the&s;e Parts, nor &s;o many Lawyers of all &s;orts, as among&s;t us. It is in my opinion, very true, that one cannot too much applaud that old <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Saying, <HI>Na-hac Kouta Beter-Ez hac Deraz,</HI> that is, <HI>Short In|ju&s;tice is better than long Ju&s;tice;</HI> and that the length of Law-Suits is un&s;ufferable in a State, and that it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the Sovereign, by all good means, to en|deavor a remedy again&s;t them. And 'tis certain, that by taking away this <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> the Root would be cut of an infinite number of Law-Proce&s;&s;es, and e&s;pecially of almo&s;t all tho&s;e that are of importance, and long and perplexed; and con&s;equently there would not need &s;o great a number of Magi&s;trates, which our Sovereigns do em|ploy to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to their Subjects, nor that &s;warm of men, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by that way. But 'tis al&s;o manife&s;t, that the Remedy would be an hundred times wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;idering tho&s;e great inconveniences that would follow there|upon, and that in all probability the Magi&s;trates would become &s;uch as tho&s;e of the <HI>A&s;i|atick</HI> States, who de&s;erve not that Name; for, in a word, our Kings have yet cau&s;e to glory upon the account of good Magi&s;tracy under them. In tho&s;e Parts, &s;ome Mer|chants

excepted, Ju&s;tice is only among the meane&s;t &s;ort of People, that are poor, and of an unequal condition, who have not the means of corrupting the Judges, and to buy fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, that are there in great numbers, and very cheap, and never puni&s;hed. And this I have learn'd every where by the experience of many years, and by my &s;olici|tous Enquiries made among the People of the Country, and our old Merchants that are in tho&s;e Parts, as al&s;o of Amba&s;&s;adors, Con&s;uls and Interpreters; whatever our com|mon Travellers may &s;ay, who, upon their having &s;een by chance, when they pa&s;&s;ed by, two or three Porters, or others of the like Gang, about a <HI>Kady,</HI> quickly di&s;patching one or other of the Parties, and &s;ometimes both, with &s;ome la&s;hes under the &s;ole of their Feet, or with a <HI>Maybal&eacute; Baba,</HI> &s;ome mild words, when there is no Wool to &s;heer; who, I &s;ay, upon &s;ight of this, come hither and cry out, O the good and &s;hort Ju|&s;tice! O what hone&s;t Judges are tho&s;e in re&s;pect of ours! Not con&s;idering in the mean time, that if one of tho&s;e Wretches, that is in the wrong; had a couple of Crowns to corrupt the <HI>Kady,</HI> or his Clerks, and as much to buy two fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, he might ei|ther win his Proce&s;s, or prolong it as long as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, to be &s;hort, I &s;ay, That the taking away this Propriety of Lands among private men, would be infallibly to introduce at the &s;ame time Tyranny, Slavery, Inju&s;tice, Beggary, Barbari&s;m, De&s;olation, and to open a Highway for the ruine and de|&s;truction of Mankind, and even of Kings and States: And that on the contrary, this <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> accompanied with the hopes that every one &s;hall keep, what he works and labours for, for him&s;elf and his Children, as his own, is the main foundation of whatever is regular and good in the World: In&s;omuch that who&s;oever &s;hall ca&s;t his eyes upon the different Countries and Kingdoms, and taketh good notice of what fol|lows upon this Propriety of Sovereigns, or that of the People, will &s;oon find the true &s;ource and chief cau&s;e of that great difference we &s;ee in the &s;everal States and Empires of the World, and avow, that this is in a manner that which changes and diver&s;ifieth the Face of the whole Earth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Know that one of the fir&s;t Que&s;tions you are like to ask me, at my return in <HI>France,</HI> will be, Whether <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Agra</HI> are Cities as fair and large, and as well peopled as <HI>Paris.</HI> Concerning its <HI>Beauty,</HI> I &s;hall tell you by way of Preface, that I have &s;ometimes wonder'd to hear our <HI>Europeans,</HI> that are here, de&s;pi&s;ing the Towns of the <HI>Indies,</HI> as not coming near ours, in re&s;pect of the Edifices. Certainly they ought not to re&s;emble them; and if <HI>Paris, London,</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> &s;tood in the place where <HI>Dehli</HI> is, the greate&s;t part of them mu&s;t be thrown down, to build them after another manner. Our Cities indeed have great Beauties and Embelli&s;hments, but they are &s;uch that are proper to them, and accommodated to a cold Climat. <HI>Dehli</HI> al&s;o may have its Beauties peculiar to it, and &s;utable to a very hot Climat: For you are to know, that the heat here obligeth all People, even the great Lords, and the King him|&s;elf, to go without Stockings, in a kind of Slippers only, a fine and &s;light Turbant on their Heads, and the other Garments accordingly; that there are months in the Sum|mer &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hot, that in the Chambers one can hardly hold ones hands again&s;t a Wall, nor ones head on a Cu&s;hion: And that People are oblig'd for the &s;pace of more than &s;ix months to lie without covering, at the door of their Chamber, as the Rabble doth in the open Streets, or as the Merchants, and other People of &s;ome Quality do, in &s;ome airy Hall or Garden, or upon &s;ome Terra&s;s well watered at Night: thence you may judge, whether if there were &s;uch &s;treets as that of St. <HI>Jacques,</HI> or St. <HI>Denis,</HI> with their Hou&s;es &s;hut, and of &s;o many Stories high, they would be habitable? And whether in the Night, e&s;pecially when the heats are without wind and &s;tuffing, it would be po&s;|&s;ible to &s;leep there? And who is there (I pray) that would have a mind in Summer, when he returns on Hor&s;eback from the City half dead, and in a manner &s;tifled of the heat and du&s;t, and all in a Sweat, (for &s;o it is) to go climbing up an high pair of Stairs, which often is narrow and dark, to a fourth or fifth Story, and to abide in this hot and &s;uffocating Air? On &s;uch occa&s;ions they de&s;ire nothing, but to throw down into the Sto|mack a Pint of fre&s;h Water, or Lemonade, to undre&s;s, to wa&s;h the Face, Hands and Feet, to lie down in &s;ome cool and &s;hady place all along, having a Servant or two to fan one by turns, with their great <HI>Panhas,</HI> or Fans. But, to leave this, we &s;hall now endeavour to entertain you with the repre&s;entation of <HI>Dehli</HI> as it is, that &s;o you may judge, whether it be truly &s;aid, that it is a fair City.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="373">
It is now about forty years that <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> Father of the Grand-Mogol <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> now reigning, to eternize his memory, cau&s;ed to be built a Town contiguous to old <HI>Dehli,</HI> which he called after his Name <HI>Chah-Jean-Abad,</HI> and by way of abbreviation <HI>Jean-Abad;</HI> that is to &s;ay, a Colony of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> de&s;igning to make it the Capital of the Empire, in&s;tead of <HI>Agra,</HI> where he &s;aid, that the Summer heats were too vio|lent. This nearne&s;s hath occa&s;ioned, that the ruines of old <HI>Dehli</HI> have &s;erved to build a new City; and in the <HI>Indies</HI> they &s;carce &s;peak any more of <HI>Dehli,</HI> but only of <HI>Jehan-Abad.</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding, &s;ince the City of <HI>Jehan-Abad</HI> is not yet known among&s;t us, I intend to &s;peak of it under the old name of <HI>Dehli,</HI> which is familiar to us.</P>
<P><HI>Dehli</HI> then is a Town altogether new, &s;eated in a plain Campagne, upon a River like our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oire,</HI> called <HI>Gemna,</HI> and built along one &s;ide of the River only; there being but one Boat-bridge to pa&s;s over into the Plain. This Town is &s;urrounded with Walls, except the River &s;ide: the&s;e Walls are of Bricks, and without a con&s;iderable defence, they be|ing without a Ditch, and having nothing to flank them but round Towers after the old way, di&s;tant from each other an hundred common paces, and a rampart behind them, four or five foot thick. The compa&s;s of the&s;e Walls, comprizing the Fortre&s;s, is not &s;o big as is commonly believed: I have gone it round with ea&s;e in three hours; and I be|lieve not, though I was on Hor&s;eback, that I di&s;patched more than one league in an hour: 'tis true, that if you will take into the Town a very long Suburb, which goeth towards <HI>Lahor,</HI> as al&s;o what remains inhabited of old <HI>Dehli,</HI> which is likewi&s;e a great and very long Suburb, and be&s;ides, three or four &s;mall Suburbs more, all that would make in a direct line above a league and a half, and &s;uch a compa&s;s which I cannot well determine, becau&s;e that between the Suburbs are great Gardens, and large &s;paces not built; but I may &s;ay, that thus taken it would be of a prodigious bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Fortre&s;s, in which is the <HI>Mehalle,</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and the other Royal Apartments, which I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak of, is built round upon the River; yet there is between the Water and the Walls a pretty large and long &s;andy &s;pace, where commonly Elephants are exerci&s;ed, and where frequently the <HI>Militia</HI> of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas</HI> is mu&s;tered in the King's pre&s;ence, who looks out of the Windows of one of his Apartments. The Walls of the Fortre&s;s, as to their round antick Towers, are very near like tho&s;e of the Town, but they are partly of Bricks, and partly of a certain red Stone re&s;embling Mar|ble, which maketh them look fairer than tho&s;e of the Town; be&s;ides that, they are much higher, &s;tronger and thicker, being able to bear &s;ome Field-pieces that are there planted towards the Town; and incompa&s;&s;ed al&s;o, excepting that &s;ide which re&s;pects the River, with a fair Ditch, walled up with Free-&s;tone, full of Water and Fi&s;h. But yet whether they are con&s;iderable for &s;trength; a battery of &s;ome middle &s;ized Canons would, in my opinion, &s;oon ca&s;t them down.</P>
<P>Round about the Ditch there is a pretty large Garden, at all times full of Flowers and green Apricocks, which together with tho&s;e great Walls all red, maketh a very fine &s;ight.</P>
<P>About this Garden is the great Street, or rather the great Place Royal, to which the two great and principal Gates of the Fortre&s;s do an&s;wer, and to the&s;e Gates the two chief Streets of the Town.</P>
<P>In this great Place it is, where the Tents of the <HI>Rajas</HI> are, that are in the King's Pay, to keep there every one in his turn their weekly Guard; whereas the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and the <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> or &s;mall <HI>Omrahs,</HI> keep it within the Fortre&s;s. The&s;e little Soveraigns are not plea&s;ed to &s;ee them&s;elves thus and &s;o long &s;hut up in a Fort.</P>
<P>In this very Place it is, where at the break of day are exerci&s;ed the Hor&s;es of a long Royal Stable, near it. And here 'tis al&s;o, that the <HI>Kobat-kan,</HI> or great Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Cavalry, carefully vieweth the Hor&s;es of tho&s;e Cavaliers, that have been received into Service, to the end that if the&s;e Hor&s;es are of <HI>Turki&s;tan,</HI> or <HI>Tartary,</HI> and large and &s;trong enough for Service, the King's Mark, and that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> under whom &s;uch Cavaliers are to be li&s;ted, may be branded upon them: A thing not ill devi&s;ed, to pre|vent the mutual Loan of Hor&s;es in the Mu&s;ters.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Place is al&s;o a kind of <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market, of an hundred things &s;old there, and a Rendezvous of Players, and Juglers of all &s;orts, as the <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> It is no le&s;s the Meeting-place of the poor <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> as well <HI>Mahumetan</HI> as <HI>Heathen.</HI> The&s;e Doctors (for&s;ooth) &s;it there in the Sun upon a piece of Tape&s;try, all covered with du&s;t, having about them &s;ome old Mathematical In&s;truments, which they make &s;hew of to draw Pa&s;&s;engers, and a great open Book repre&s;enting the Animals of the <HI>Zodiack.</HI> The&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="374">
men are the Oracles, but rather the Affronters of the Vulgar, to whom they pretend to give, for one <HI>Pay&s;&s;a,</HI> that is, a penny, good Luck; and they are they, that looking up|on the Hands and the Face, turning over their Books, and making a &s;hew of Calculati|on, determine the fortunate moment when a Bu&s;ine&s;s is to be begun to make it &s;ucce&s;s|ful. The mean Women, wrapt up in a white Sheet from Head to Foot, come to find them out, telling them in their Ear their mo&s;t &s;ecret Concerns, as if they were their Confe&s;&s;ors, and (which &s;mells very &s;trongly of Stupidity and Folly) entreat them to render the Stars propitious to them &s;uitable to their De&s;igns; as if they could ab&s;olutely di&s;po&s;e of their Influences.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ridiculous of all the&s;e A&s;trologers, in my opinion, was that mongrel <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> fugitive from <HI>Goa,</HI> who &s;ate in that Place with much Gravity upon his piece of Ta|pe&s;try, like the re&s;t, and had a great deal of Cu&s;tom, though he could neither write nor read, and as for In&s;truments and Books, was furni&s;hed with nothing el&s;e but an old Sea-Compa&s;s, and an old <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prayer-Book in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, of which he &s;hewed the Pictures for Figures of the <HI>Zodiack: A tal Be&s;tias, tal A&s;trologuo:</HI> For &s;uch Bea&s;ts, &s;uch A&s;trologer, &s;aid he to the Reverend Father <HI>Buze,</HI> a Je&s;uit, who met him in that Place.</P>
<P>I here &s;peak only of the pitiful A&s;trologers of the <HI>Bazar;</HI> for there are others in the&s;e Parts, that are in the Courts of the Grandees, and are con&s;idered as great Clerks, and are very rich; whole <HI>A&s;ia</HI> being over&s;pread with this Super&s;tition. The Kings and the great Lords, who would not undertake the lea&s;t things without con&s;ulting them, allow them great Salaries, that they may read to them what is written in the Heavens, (for &s;o they &s;peak here) and take out for them that fortunate moment, I was lately &s;peaking of; or find out, at the opening of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the deci&s;ion of all their Doubts.</P>
<P>To return; the&s;e two principal Streets, which I &s;aid do an&s;wer to the two Gates of the Fortre&s;s, and to the Place, may have twenty five or thirty common paces in breadth, and they run in a &s;treight line as far as you are able to &s;ee: Yet that which leads to the Gate of <HI>Labor,</HI> is much longer than the other; but they are both alike as to the Hou&s;es. There is on both &s;ides nothing but Arches, as in our <HI>Place Royal;</HI> yet with this diffe|rence, that they are but of Bricks, and that there is not any Building upon them, but only the Terra&s;s. There is al&s;o this difference, that they are not continued Galleries. The&s;e Arches are generally &s;evered by Rails that make Shops which are not to be &s;hut, where Trade&s;-men work in the day, where Bankers &s;it for their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and where Merchants &s;et out their Wares, which at night they lock up in a Magazin, the little Door of which, to be &s;hut, is in the bottom of every Arch.</P>
<P>It is upon this Magazin, which is in the back-part of the Arches, that the Hou&s;es of Merchants are built and rai&s;ed, which make a Shew good enough towards the Street, and are al&s;o pretty convenient, being well aired, out of the way of the du&s;t, and ha|ving for their Floor the terra&s;&s;es of the Arches, upon which they can walk to look out upon the Street, and to &s;leep at night in <HI>fre&s;co.</HI> But excepting the&s;e Hou&s;es of the chief Streets, and a few others, there are not many of the&s;e fair Hou&s;es, that are thus rai&s;ed upon Terra&s;&s;es; nor are even the&s;e two Streets univer&s;ally furni&s;ht with them, there be|ing mo&s;tly upon the Magazin, or on the &s;ide, nothing but a &s;mall Building, not &s;een from the Street, the great Merchants having their Hou&s;es &s;omewhere el&s;e, whither they retire at night.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>two</HI> principal Streets, there are yet <HI>five</HI> others, which indeed are not &s;o long nor &s;o &s;treight, but for the re&s;t are altogether like them. There are al&s;o a great many other Streets cro&s;&s;ing tho&s;e on all &s;ides, whereof there are al&s;o &s;ome furni&s;ht with Arches; but becau&s;e they have been built piece-meal by &s;uch particular per&s;ons, as have not ob&s;erved the Symmetry that was requi&s;ite, they are, for the mo&s;t part, neither &s;o large nor &s;o &s;treight, nor &s;o well built as the others.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the&s;e Streets are &s;pread every where the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> or little <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and tho&s;e of the men of the Law, as al&s;o of many great Merchants, and other private men; of which there is a good number that are pa&s;&s;able. It is true, there are but few that are all of Brick or Stone, and there is even a good number of the&s;e, that are made all of Earth only, and thatched; but for all that, they are convenient, becau&s;e they are generally airy, being furni&s;hed with Courts and Gardens. Nor are they di&s;a|greeable within, fora&s;much as be&s;ides the fine moveables, the&s;e thatched Coverings are &s;upported by a layer of certain long Canes, that are hard and &s;trong, and very pretty, and becau&s;e al&s;o the&s;e earthen Walls are pla&s;tered over with very fine and very white Chalk.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="374">
Among&s;t the&s;e Hou&s;es I have been &s;peaking of, that are tolerable, there is al&s;o a pro|digious number of other &s;mall ones, that are only made up of Earth and Straw, where all the &s;imple Cavaliers, and their Servants, and all tho&s;e little people of the Market, that follow the Court and the Army are lodged.</P>
<P>It is from the&s;e thatched Hou&s;es that <HI>Dehli</HI> is &s;o &s;ubject to Fires. This la&s;t year there were burnt above &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;uch, at two or three times that they took Fire, when there blew certain impetuous Winds, that ri&s;e chiefly in Summer. The Fire was &s;o quick and &s;o violent, that it &s;urpri&s;ed the Hou&s;es, and many Hor&s;es al&s;o that could not be time enough loo&s;ened; and there were even &s;ome of the&s;e poor Women burnt, that never had been out of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and that are &s;o weak and &s;hamefaced when they &s;ee people, that they know nothing el&s;e but to hide their Faces.</P>
<P>And it is upon the account of the&s;e pitiful Hou&s;es of Earth and Straw, that I look upon <HI>Dehli</HI> almo&s;t no otherwi&s;e than as many Villages joyned together, and (which I have already &s;aid in another place) as a Camp of an Army, a little better and more commo|diou&s;ly placed, than in the Field.</P>
<P>As to the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that are al&s;o up and down in this City, and princi|pally upon the River, and even in the Suburbs: You are to know that in the&s;e hot Countries, to entitle an Hou&s;e to the name of Good and Fair, it is required it &s;hould be commodious, &s;eated in a Place well aired, and capable to receive the Wind from all &s;ides, and principally from the North; having Courts, Gardens, Trees, Con&s;ervatories, and little jets of Waters in the Halls, or at lea&s;t at the Entry; furni&s;hed al&s;o with good Cellars with great Flaps to &s;tir the Air, for repo&s;ing in the fre&s;h Air from twelve till four or five of the Clock, when the Air of the&s;e Cellars begins to be hot and &s;tuffing: or having in lieu of Cellarage certain <HI>Kas-kanays,</HI> that is, little Hou&s;es of Straw, or rather of odoriferous Roots, that are very neatly made, and commonly placed in the mid&s;t of a <HI>Parterre</HI> near &s;ome Con&s;ervatory, that &s;o the Servants may ea&s;ily, with their Pompion|bottles, water them from without. Moreover it is required for the beauty of an Hou&s;e, that it be &s;eated in the mid&s;t of &s;ome great <HI>Parterre,</HI> that it have four great Divans or Ways rai&s;ed from the ground to the height of a man, or thereabout, and expo&s;ed to the four Parts of the World, to receive the Wind and the Cold from all the Parts it may come from. La&s;tly, it is requi&s;ite for a good Hou&s;e to have rai&s;ed <HI>Terra&s;&s;es,</HI> to &s;leep up|on in the night, &s;uch as are of the &s;ame Floor with &s;ome great Chamber, to draw in ones Bed-&s;tead upon occa&s;ion; that is to &s;ay, when there comes &s;ome Tempe&s;t of Rain or Du&s;t, or when that rou&s;ing fre&s;hne&s;s of the break of day awakens you, and obliges you to look for a Covering: or el&s;e when you apprehend that &s;mall and light Dew of the morning, which pierceth, and cau&s;eth &s;ometimes benumming and paralitical Symptoms in the Limbs.</P>
<P>As to the interior part of an Hou&s;e, it is requi&s;ite that the whole Floor be covered with a mattere&s;s of Cotton four inches thick, covered with a white fine linnen Sheet during Summer, and with a piece of &s;ilk Tape&s;try in Winter: That in the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous part of the Chamber, near the Wall, there be one or two cotton Quilts, with fine flowered Coverings, and &s;et about with &s;mall and fine embroidery of Silk, wrought with Gold and Silver, for the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, or Per&s;ons of Quality coming in, to &s;it upon; and that every Quilt have its cro&s;s Board, purfled with God, to lean upon: that round about the Chamber, along the Walls, there be &s;everal of the&s;e cro&s;s Boards, as I ju&s;t now mentioned, hand&s;omly covered with Velvet or flowred Sattin, for By|&s;tanders al&s;o to lean upon. The Walls five or &s;ix foot from the Floor, mu&s;t be almo&s;t all with <HI>Niches,</HI> or little Windows, cut in an hundred different manners, or &s;hapes, ve|ry fine, well mea&s;ured and proportioned to one another, with &s;ome porcelain Ve&s;&s;els and Flower-pots in them; and the Ground mu&s;t be painted and guilded, yet without any figure of Man or Bea&s;t, their Religion not allowing thereof.</P>
<P>This is as near as I know, the Idea of a hand&s;om and convenient Hou&s;e in the&s;e Parts: And as there is a good number of them in <HI>Dehli,</HI> that have all the&s;e Qualities mentioned, or at lea&s;t in part, according to which they are more or le&s;s fair and gal|lant: I believe one may &s;ay, without any injury to our Towns, that <HI>Dehli</HI> is not with|out Hou&s;es that are truly hand&s;om, although they be not like ours in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Appearance and Riches of the Shops, (which is the thing that con|tributeth mo&s;t to the beauty of our Towns in <HI>Europe)</HI> although <HI>Dehli</HI> be the Seat of a ve|ry potent and magnificent Court, and con&s;equently the re&s;ort of infinite quantities and varieties of rich Wares; yet we are not to imagine, that you &s;hall find there our Streets
<PB N="80" REF="375">
of St. <HI>Denis;</HI> I know not whether there be any &s;uch in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And even as to the mo&s;t fine and the mo&s;t rich Stuffs, they are commonly but in the Magazins, their Shops are not furni&s;ht with them: So that for one Shop that maketh any &s;hew, that is, where there are &s;old tho&s;e fine &s;orts of Linnen, tho&s;e Stuffs of Silk &s;treaked with Gold and Sil|ver, Cloth of Gold, Turbands embroidered with Gold, and other Commodities of great price; you &s;hall always find five and twenty and more, that are filled with nothing but Pots of Oyl and Butter, and Panniers one upon another full of Rice, Barley, Pea&s;e, Corn, and many other &s;orts of Grain and Legume; which are the ordinary Food not only of all the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that never eat any meat, but al&s;o of the meaner &s;ort of the <HI>Ma|humetans,</HI> and of a good part of tho&s;e of the Souldiery.</P>
<P>It is true that there is a Fruit-market that maketh &s;ome &s;hew. One may there &s;ee in Summer abundance of Shops full of dry Fruit, that come out of <HI>Per&s;ia, Balk, Bokara,</HI> and <HI>Samarkand,</HI> as Almonds, Pi&s;taches, &s;mall Nuts, Rai&s;ins, Prunes, Apricocks, and the like. And in Winter there are found excellent Rai&s;ins fre&s;h, black and white, brought from the &s;ame Countries, well wrapt up in Cotton; al&s;o Apples and Pears of three or four &s;orts, and of the&s;e admirable Melons that la&s;t all Winter. But all this Fruit is very dear; I have &s;een Melons &s;old even for a Crown and an half a piece. And they are in|deed the great delicacy and expence of the <HI>Omrahs.</HI> I have often &s;een in the Hou&s;e of my <HI>Aga,</HI> that there was eaten in Melons in one morning for more than twenty Crowns. There are none but the Melons of the Country that are cheap in Summer, but tho&s;e are not &s;o good. The Grandees only, that take care to &s;end for Seed out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and to get the Ground well fitted for them, may eat good ones; yet that but rarely neither, the Ground being not &s;o proper but that the Seed degenerateth the very fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>It is true, there is yet another Fruit called <HI>Amba,</HI> or <HI>Mangue,</HI> which in its &s;ea&s;on, during two Summer months, is found in great plenty and very cheap; but tho&s;e of <HI>Dehli</HI> are none of the be&s;t, being very loo&s;e and fla&s;hly: tho&s;e of <HI>Bengala, Golkonda,</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> are admirable. It hath a certain &s;weetne&s;s &s;o peculiar, that I doubt whether there be any Com&s;it in the World &s;o plea&s;ant. There are al&s;o <HI>Pateques,</HI> or Water-Melons in abundance, and almo&s;t all the year long; but they al&s;o do not thrive well at <HI>Dehli;</HI> they never have their meat &s;o ruddy, firm and &s;uggary; and if there be any good, they are not to be found but among&s;t the Great ones, who take the pains of making them grow as Melons, with extraordinary care and co&s;t.</P>
<P>There be al&s;o up and down in <HI>Dehli</HI> Shops of <HI>Comfit-makers;</HI> but all their Comfits are very ill done, being full of Du&s;t and Flyes.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides many Shops of <HI>Bread</HI> every where, but becau&s;e they have no Ovens like ours, it is never well baked: yet in the Fortre&s;s there is &s;old &s;ome that is rea&s;ona|bly good; and the <HI>Omrahs</HI> cau&s;e &s;uch to be made in their Hou&s;es that is very delicate, &s;paring no new Butter, Milk, nor Eggs: yet though they leaven it, it is always much inferior in goodne&s;s to our Bread of <HI>Gone&s;&s;e,</HI> and to tho&s;e other &s;orts of excellent Bread of <HI>Paris,</HI> it &s;avouring always of the Cake or Simnel.</P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>Bazars</HI> there are al&s;o &s;ome Tents, where they trade in Ro&s;t-meat, and in dre&s;&s;ing I know not how many &s;orts of Di&s;hes; but all that is but beggarly, na&s;ty, and ill meat. I fear you &s;ometimes meet with the fle&s;h of Camels, Hor&s;es, or Oxen, dead of &s;ickne&s;s: I do not much tru&s;t them; &s;o that if you will eat any thing worth eating, you mu&s;t have it dre&s;&s;ed at home.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many Shops every where where they &s;ell Fle&s;h; but you mu&s;t take heed, le&s;t they give you Mutton for Kid; the Mutton and Beef, but e&s;pecially Mutton, though well enough ta&s;ted, being here very hot, windy, and of ill dige&s;tion. The be&s;t meat here is young Kid, but it is very rarely &s;old in the Market by Quarters; &s;o that if you have a mind to eat any, you mu&s;t buy a whole and a live one; which is inconcenient enough, becau&s;e the meat is &s;poiled between one morning and evening, and is common|ly &s;o lean, that it is ta&s;tele&s;s. Ordinarily you find in the Shambles nothing but the quarters of great Kids, which often al&s;o are very lean and hard. It is true, that &s;ince I have learned &s;omething of the manner of the Country, I find both Meat and Bread good enough, becau&s;e I &s;end my Servant to the Fortre&s;s to the King's Caterers, who are ve|ry ready to let him have what is good for good payment, though it co&s;t them nothing. And it was in reference to this, that one day I made my <HI>Agah</HI> &s;mile, when I told him that I had I know not how many years lived by artifice and &s;tealing, and that for all the 150 Crowns pay he monthly allowed me, I was ready to be &s;tarved; whereas in <HI>France</HI> for half a Roupy, I could every day eat as good a bit of meat as the King.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="375">
They have no Capons, all that People b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ing too tender-hearted towards all Animals but Men, whom they need for their <HI>Seraglios.</HI> But the Markets are full of Hens, that are very good and cheap: Among the re&s;t there is one &s;ort of little ones, that I called <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Hens, becau&s;e they have their skin black like the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> which are very tender and very delicate.</P>
<P>Pidgeons there are, but no young ones, becau&s;e they will not kill them young; they would be (&s;ay they) too &s;mall, and it were ill done to kill &s;uch poor little Animals.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Partridges, but &s;maller than ours, and generally (&s;eeing they bring them afar off alive, knowing how to take them with Nets) they are wor&s;e than our Pullets. The like may be &s;aid of their Ducks and Hares, of which they al&s;o bring whole Cages full alive.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> the People here are no great Fi&s;h-mongers; yet at times one meets with very good Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially of two &s;orts, the one re&s;embleth our Pike, and the o|ther our Carp; but that is only when it is not cold, for the <HI>Indians</HI> fear that much more than we <HI>Europeans</HI> apprehend heat. And if at any time you meet accidentally with any, the Eunuchs, who love them exce&s;&s;ively, (I know not why) carry them pre&s;ently a|way. None but the <HI>Omrahs</HI> have power to make men fi&s;h when they plea&s;e, which they do with the <HI>Korrah,</HI> that great common Whip always hanging at their Gates.</P>
<P>From all that I have &s;aid, you may by the By &s;ee, whether a man ought to leave <HI>Pa|ris</HI> to come to <HI>Dehli</HI> to make good cheer. Certainly the Grandees have all things, but that is upon the account of their many Servants, of the <HI>Korrah,</HI> and of the plenty of Money. And thence it was I once &s;aid, that at <HI>Dehli</HI> there is no <HI>mean;</HI> there you mu&s;t either be a great Lord, or live mi&s;erably: for I have experienced it my &s;elf, in a man|ner dying of Hunger this good while though I have had con&s;iderable Pay, and was re|&s;olved to &s;pare nothing that way, becau&s;e commonly there is found nothing in the Mar|kets but the refu&s;e of the Grandees. Be&s;ides that, the &s;oul of a Fea&s;t which is good Wine, is not there; not that no Grapes do grow there to make Wine, (for I have drunk &s;ome at <HI>Amadevad</HI> and <HI>Golkonda,</HI> in the Hou&s;es of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that was not ill) but becau&s;e it is prohibited to make Wine, in regard that not only by the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but al&s;o by that of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> it is not permitted to drink any: So that it is very rare to find Wine, and that which we find comes out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Chiras</HI> by Land to <HI>Banderaba&s;y,</HI> from thence by Sea to <HI>Suratte,</HI> and from <HI>Suratte</HI> hither by Land in forty &s;ix days: or it comes from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> brought al&s;o over Sea to <HI>Suratte</HI> by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> And both are &s;o dear, that the co&s;t (as the &s;aying is) maketh it lo&s;e the ta&s;te; for a Bottle holding about three <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> pints cometh often to &s;ix or &s;even Crowns, and more. That which is of this Countreys growth is called <HI>Arac,</HI> a &s;trong Water made of Sugar not refined, and even this is expre&s;ly prohibited to be &s;old, and there are none but <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> that dare drink of it, except others do it by &s;tealth. This is a Drink very hot and penetrant, like the Brandy made of Corn in <HI>Poland.</HI> It &s;o falls upon the Nerves, that it often cau&s;eth &s;haking Hands in tho&s;e that drink a little too much of it, and ca&s;ts them into incurable Maladies. Here we mu&s;t accu&s;tom our &s;elves to fair and good Water, and to Lemonade, which is excellent, and may be made with &s;mall charges, and doth not &s;poil the Stomach. But to &s;ay all, a man hath no great in|clination, in &s;uch hot Countries as the&s;e to drink Wine; and I am willing notice &s;hould be here taken together with me, that the ab&s;tinence from Wine in the&s;e Parts, joyned to the general &s;obriety of the Natives, and to the &s;weats and perpetual tran&s;piration made by the pores, are the cau&s;e (in my opinion) that we almo&s;t know not what is the Gout, the Stone, Aches of the Kidneys, Rheumati&s;ms, Quartans; and that tho&s;e that bring any of the&s;e Sickne&s;&s;es hither, as I did, are at length totally freed from them: and further, that the Pox it &s;elf, though very frequent, is not &s;o cruel nor &s;o pernicious here as in <HI>Europe:</HI> &s;o that People generally live here more healthily than with us. But then on the other hand, there is not &s;o much vigour here in People, as in our cold Cli|mat; and this feeblene&s;s and languor of body is a kind of perpetual malady, very trouble&s;om to all, e&s;pecially in the great heats of Summer, and e&s;pecially to the <HI>Europe|ans,</HI> who&s;e bodies are not yet inured to heat.</P>
<P>As for Shops of excellent Handy-craft&s;men, that is al&s;o a thing we mu&s;t not look for here: all we find is but very little; not that the <HI>Indians</HI> have not wit enough to make them &s;ucce&s;sful in Arts, they doing very well (as to &s;ome of them) in many Parts of <HI>India,</HI> and it being found that they have inclination enough for them, and that &s;ome of them make (even without a Ma&s;ter) very pretty workman&s;hip, and imitate &s;o well
<PB N="82" REF="376">
our Work of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the difference thereof will hardly be di&s;cerned. I have &s;een among&s;t them even of our kind of Guns, very fine and very good; and pieces of Gold|&s;miths Work &s;o well done, that I doubt whether in <HI>Europe</HI> they could be made better. I have al&s;o &s;een in <HI>Picture</HI> and <HI>Miniature</HI> &s;uch curious and delicate pieces, that I admi|red them. Among&s;t others, I have &s;een the Combats of <HI>Eckbar,</HI> repre&s;ented upon a Buckler by a famous Painter, who was &s;aid to have been &s;even years working at it, which &s;eemed to me an admirable piece of Work. It is manife&s;t, that they want no|thing but good Ma&s;ters, and the precepts of Art to give them ju&s;t proportions; and above all, that life of the Face, to which they have not yet been able to attain. The Rea&s;on therefore why in the Shops of <HI>Dehli</HI> there are rarely found good Handy-craft&s;|men, is not want of Wit, but contempt of the Workmen, who are ill treated, and who&s;e Work is deba&s;ed to too low a price. If &s;ome <HI>Omrah,</HI> or <HI>Man&s;ebdar,</HI> will have any thing made by a Workman of the <HI>Bazar,</HI> he will &s;end for him, and make him work in a manner by force, and afterwards pay him as he plea&s;eth; and the man will think him&s;elf happy too, if in part of payment he receive not the <HI>Korrah.</HI> What heart then can a poor Workman have to take pains to &s;ucceed in his Workman&s;hip? He con&s;iders nothing but to di&s;patch his Work, thereby to earn &s;omething to put Bread into his Mouth. So that if there be any of them that &s;ucceed, they are of tho&s;e whom the great Lords entertain in their Service, and that work only for them.</P>
<P>Touching the things within the Fortre&s;s, where are the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and &s;ome other Royal Edifices, you mu&s;t not look for a <HI>Louvre,</HI> or an <HI>E&s;eurial;</HI> tho&s;e Buildings do not re&s;emble ours, nor by what I have &s;aid, ought they to re&s;emble them: it is enough that they have that &s;tateline&s;s, which is proper to the Climat.</P>
<P>I find nothing remarkable at the entry, but two great Elephants of &s;tone, which are on the two &s;ides of one of the Gates. Upon one of them is the Statue of <HI>Jamel,</HI> that famous <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Chitar,</HI> and upon the other, that of <HI>Polta</HI> his Brother. The&s;e are tho&s;e two gallant Men, that together with their Mother, who was yet braver than they, cut &s;o much Work for <HI>Eckbar;</HI> and who in the Sieges of Towns, which they maintained again&s;t him, gave &s;uch extraordinary proofs of their Genero&s;ity, that at length they would rather be killed in the out-falls with their Mother, than &s;ubmit: and for this Gallantry it is, that even their Enemies thought them worthy to have the&s;e Statues erected for them. The&s;e two great Elephants, together with the two re&s;olute Men &s;itting on them, do at the fir&s;t entry into this Fortre&s;s make an impre&s;&s;ion of I know not what greatne&s;s and awful terror.</P>
<P>After you have pa&s;&s;ed this Gate, you find a long and large Street, divided into two by a Channel of running Water, and having on both &s;ides, as our Pont-neuf, a long rai&s;ed Wall five or &s;ix foot high, and four broad; and further off &s;ome Arches &s;hut, that follow one another all along in the form of Gates. It is upon this long rai&s;ed Place that tho&s;e Clerks, Controllers, and other &s;mall Officers &s;it to do their Office, without being incommoded by the Hor&s;es and People that pa&s;s along beneath. And it is there al&s;o where the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> or little <HI>Omrahs,</HI> are at night to keep the Guard. The Water of the Channel runneth dividing it &s;elf through the whole <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and at length falleth into the Ditches to fill them. It is drawn out of the River by a Channel opened five or &s;ix leagues above <HI>Dehli,</HI> and conveyed cro&s;s the Field, and that through &s;ome Rocks that have co&s;t great pains to be cut in divers places. And this is very near what may be &s;een at the entry into one of the two principal Gates, that an&s;wer to the great <HI>Piazza.</HI></P>
<P>If you enter at the other Gate, you al&s;o find pre&s;ently a pretty long and large Street, having its ri&s;ings on the &s;ides as the other, together with Shops upon them in lieu of the Arches. This Street is properly a <HI>Bazar,</HI> which is very commodious during the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains and Summer, becau&s;e it is covered by a long and large Vault, which hath on the top great openings to let in light.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two Streets, there are many other &s;mall ones on the right and left hand, that lead to the Apartments, where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> keep their Guard, each in his turn, once a week, for twenty four hours. The&s;e Places are &s;tately ones for <HI>Corps de Gardes,</HI> the <HI>Omrahs</HI> &s;triving to beautifie them at their own charges. The&s;e are ordinarily great rai&s;ed Places re&s;pecting a <HI>Parterne,</HI> that hath its little Channels of running Water, &s;mall Con&s;ervatories and Jets of Water. The <HI>Omrahs</HI> during the twenty four hours of Guard, take no care for their Table, the King &s;ending them all their Meat ready dre&s;|&s;ed, and they being but to receive it, as they do, with very much Ceremony and Re|&s;pect,
<PB N="83" REF="376">
making three obey&s;ances of thanks, by elevating their Hand upon their Head, and bowing down to the ground, their Face turned toward the King.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o found many rai&s;ed Walks and Tents in &s;undry Places, that are the Offices of &s;everal Officers. Be&s;ides, there are many great Halls that are the <HI>Kar-kanays,</HI> or Places where Handy-craft&s;men do work. In one of the&s;e Halls you &s;hall find Em|broiderers at work, together with their Chief that in&s;pects them; in another you &s;hall &s;ee Gold-&s;miths; in a third Picture-drawers; in a fourth Workmen in <HI>Lacca;</HI> in o|thers, Joyners, Turners, Taylors, Shoo-makers; in others, Workmen in Silk and pur|fled Gold, and in all tho&s;e &s;orts of fine Cloth, of which they make Turbands, Girdles with golden flowers, and tho&s;e Drawers of Ladies, that are &s;o fine and delicate, as that &s;ometimes they la&s;t them but one night, though they often co&s;t them ten or twelve Crowns, when they are of that fa&s;hion, as I have mentioned; I mean, enriched with tho&s;e fine Embroideries of Needle-work.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Handy-craft&s;men come in the morning to tho&s;e <HI>Kar-kanays,</HI> and work there all day long, and at night return to their &s;everal homes, every one pa&s;&s;ing his Life qui|etly, without a&s;piring above his condition: for the Embroiderer maketh his Son an Em|broiderer, the Gold-&s;mith maketh his Son a Gold &s;mith, and a Phy&s;ician in a Town maketh his Son a Phy&s;ician; and no body marrieth but with tho&s;e that are of his Trade: which is religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, not only among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> that are obliged to it by their Law, but almo&s;t always among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> them&s;elves: Whence it is that you may often &s;ee very hand&s;om young Women, that remain unmarried, pa&s;&s;ing their time as well as they can, though they might meet with good Matches, if their Parents would or could marry them into another Family, e&s;teemed le&s;s noble than their own.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e Apartments, we come at length to the <HI>Am-kas,</HI> which is &s;omething very Royal. This is a great &s;quare Court with Arches, as may be our <HI>Place Royal:</HI> with this difference, that there are no Buildings atop, and that the Arches are &s;evered from one another by a Wall, yet &s;o that there is a &s;mall Gate to pa&s;s from one to the other. Over the great Gate, which is in the middle of one of the &s;ides of this Square, there is a large rai&s;ed Place, all open on the &s;ide of the Court, which is called <HI>Nagar|kanay,</HI> becau&s;e that is the Place where the Trumpets are, or rather the Hoboys and Tim|bals, that play together in con&s;ort at certain hours of the day and night: but this is a very odd con&s;ort in the Ears of an <HI>European</HI> that is a new comer, not yet accu&s;tomed to it: for &s;ometimes there are ten or twelve of tho&s;e Hoboys, and as many Timbals, that &s;ound altogether at once; and there is an Hoboy which is called <HI>Karna,</HI> a fathom and an half long, and of half a foot aperture below; as there are Timbals of Bra&s;s or Iron, that have no le&s;s than a fathom in diameter: whence it is ea&s;ie to judge, what a noi&s;e they mu&s;t needs make. Indeed this Mu&s;ick in the beginning did &s;o pierce and &s;tun me, that it was un&s;ufferable for me; yet I know not what &s;trange power cu&s;tom hath, for I now find it very plea&s;ing, e&s;pecially in the night, when I hear it afar off in my bed upon my Terra&s;s; then it &s;eemeth to me to carry with it &s;omething that is grave, ma|je&s;tical and very melodious. And there is &s;ome Rea&s;on for this melody; for &s;eeing it hath its Rules and Mea&s;ures, and that there are excellent Ma&s;ters taught from their youth to manage it, and perfectly know how to qualifie and temper tho&s;e &s;trong &s;ounds of the Hoboys and Timbals, it cannot be otherwi&s;e, but they mu&s;t thence obtain &s;ome &s;ympathy that cannot be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Ear, provided (as I &s;aid) that it be heard at a di&s;tance. And even for this Rea&s;on it is, that they have placed the <HI>Nagar-kanay,</HI> very high, and remote from the Ears of the King, as you will hear by and by.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the great Gate of the Court, upon which is the <HI>Nagar-kanay,</HI> beyond the whole Court, there is a great and &s;tately Hall, with many ranks of Pillars high rai&s;|ed, very airy, open on three &s;ides, looking to the Court, and having its Pillars and Ground painted and guilded. In the mid&s;t of the Wall, which &s;eparateth this Hall from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> there is an opening, or a kind of great Window high and large, and &s;o high that a Man cannot reach to it from below with his hand: There it is where the King appears &s;eated upon his Throne, having his Sons on his &s;ides, and &s;ome Eunuchs &s;tanding, &s;ome of which drive away the Flyes with Peacocks-tails, others fan him with great Fans, others &s;tand there ready with great re&s;pect and humility for &s;everal Servi|ces. Thence he &s;eeth beneath him all the <HI>Omrahs, Rajas,</HI> and Amba&s;&s;adors, who are al|&s;o all of them &s;tanding upon a rai&s;ed Ground encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;ilver Rails, with their Eyes downwards, and their Hands cro&s;&s;ing their Stomachs: &s;omewhat further off he
<PB N="84" REF="377">
&s;eeth the <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> or le&s;&s;er <HI>Omrahs,</HI> which are al&s;o all &s;tanding in the &s;ame po&s;ture and re&s;pect as the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do: and &s;omewhat further off, in the remaining part of the Hall, and in the Court, he &s;eeth a great crowd of all &s;orts of People. For there it is where the King every day about noon giveth a general Audience to all; which is the Rea&s;on that this great Hall is called <HI>Am-kas,</HI> that is, Place of Audience, or a Place of Meeting common to great and &s;mall.</P>
<P>During an hour and an half, or thereabouts, whil&s;t this A&s;&s;embly la&s;teth, the King is diverted by &s;eeing pa&s;s before him a certain number of the hand&s;ome&s;t Hor&s;es of his Stables, to &s;ee whether they be well dre&s;&s;ed, and in good plight. So he doth &s;ee a good number of Elephants pa&s;&s;ing al&s;o before him, who&s;e dirty bodies are then well wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed, and painted black like Ink, except that they have two great &s;treaks painted red, which from the top of their Head come down to their Trunk, where they meet. The&s;e Elephants have then al&s;o certain deckings embroidred with a couple of &s;ilver Bells hanging down on the &s;ides, fa&s;tened to the two ends of a great &s;ilver Chain, pa&s;&s;ing over their Shoulders; as al&s;o certain Cow-tails of the great <HI>Tibet,</HI> white and very dear, hanging at their Ears like great Mu&s;tachoes: and two little Elephants well accoutred going by their &s;ides, as if they were their Slaves and appointed to &s;erve them. The&s;e great Colo&s;&s;es, as if they were proud to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;o bravely adorned and at|tended, march with much gravity; and when they are come before the King, the Con|ductor that &s;its upon their Shoulders, with a pointed Iron in his Hand pricketh them, and &s;peaketh to them, and maketh them bow with one Knee, and lift up the Trunk into the Air and make a noi&s;e, which the People take for a <HI>Ta&s;lim,</HI> or deep Salute.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Elephants there are brought divers tamed <HI>Gazelles,</HI> which are made to fight with one another; as al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Nilgaux,</HI> or grey Oxen, which in my opinion are a kind of <HI>Elands</HI> and <HI>Rhinocero&s;s,</HI> and tho&s;e great <HI>Buffalos</HI> of <HI>Bengala</HI> with their prodigi|ous Horns to combat with a Lion or Tiger; likewi&s;e <HI>Leopards,</HI> or Panthers tamed, which he u&s;eth in the hunting of <HI>Gazelles:</HI> further, &s;ome of tho&s;e hand&s;om hunting <HI>Dogs</HI> of <HI>&V;sbeck</HI> of all &s;orts, every one with his little red Cover; &s;tore of <HI>Birds</HI> of prey of all kinds, &s;ome of which are for Partridges, others for Cranes, others to fall upon Hares, and, as they &s;ay, upon the very Gazelles, beating their Heads and blinding them with their Wings and Claws.</P>
<P>Often al&s;o one or two of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> cau&s;e at that time to pa&s;s their Cavalry for a review before the King: the <HI>Omrahs</HI> coveting that their Hor&s;emen &s;hould appear gallant, advantagiou&s;ly decked with extraordinary Garments, and their Hor&s;es trapped with Iron, and harne&s;&s;ed with I know not how many different and odd fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>The King taketh &s;ometimes plea&s;ure him&s;elf to cau&s;e Cutla&s;es, or &s;hort Swords, to be tryed upon dead Sheep, brought to him without the bowels, and very neatly packed up, where the young <HI>Omrahs, Man&s;eb-dars</HI> and <HI>Gourze-berdars,</HI> or Mace-bearers, &s;trive to &s;hew their force and dexterity by cutting a&s;under the four Legs joyned together, and the Body of the Sheep all in one &s;troke.</P>
<P>Mean time all the&s;e Diverti&s;ements are nothing but an Interlude of &s;erious Affairs: for as I have &s;aid, the King omits not to make a Mu&s;ter of his Cavalry, and well to view them him&s;elf. We have &s;een, that the War being ended, there is not one Cava|lier, nor any other Souldier, but He hath &s;een him and examined him, either to increa&s;e his Pay, or to le&s;&s;en it, or quite to ca&s;hier him. Be&s;ides it is &s;een every day, that he commands the Petitions, which are &s;hewed him afar off in the crowd of the People, to be brought to him and to be read: ordering the Parties concerned to approach, and examining them, and often cau&s;ing Ju&s;tice to be done them immediately, although he hath the <HI>Adalet-kanay,</HI> the Chamber of Ju&s;tice, where he ordinarily is pre&s;ent once a week, attended by his two fir&s;t <HI>Kadys,</HI> or Chief Ju&s;tices: and though al&s;o at one other time in the week he hath the patience to hear in private, for the &s;pace of two hours, ten Per&s;ons of the common People, whom a good and rich old Man pre&s;ents to him. Whence it appears (to note that by the By) that tho&s;e Kings, how barbarous &s;oever e&s;teemed by us, do yet con&s;tantly remember, that they owe Ju&s;tice to their Sub|jects.</P>
<P>All what I have been relating to you of what is tran&s;acted in this A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Am|kas,</HI> &s;eems to me great and royal; but that which hath extreamly offended me there, is a kind of Adulation too mean and flat, commonly heard in that Place. For the King cannot &s;ay a word to any purpo&s;e, but he is pre&s;ently exalted, and &s;ome of the fir&s;t <HI>Om|rahs</HI> lifting up their Hands, as if they were to receive &s;ome Benediction from Heaven,

cry out, <HI>Karamat! Karamat!</HI> Wonder! Wonder! Neither is there any <HI>Mogolian</HI> but he knoweth and glorieth in reciting this Proverb in <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ver&s;e:</P>
<Q><L>Aguer chach ronzra Gouyed cheh e&s;t in</L>

<P><HI>If the King &s;aith at Noon-day, it is Night, you are to &s;ay, behold the Moon and the Stars.</HI> This Vice pa&s;&s;eth even unto the People. I have &s;een an hundred times People of <HI>Mo|gol,</HI> who having need of me in &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, made no &s;cruple to come and tell me to my Face for a Preamble, that I was <HI>Ari&s;totalis, Bocrate,</HI> and <HI>Abouy&s;ina &V;lzaman;</HI> the <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> the <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and the <HI>Avicenna</HI> of the Time. At fir&s;t I endeavoured to fence my &s;elf again&s;t it by this ordinary Complement, that I was none &s;uch, and was far infe|rior to the merit of tho&s;e Men: but that made them wor&s;e; &s;o that I thought it better to accu&s;tom my Ears to their Flattery, as I have done to their Mu&s;ick. I cannot forbear imparting to you this little piece of Flattery, becau&s;e <HI>that</HI> will let you &s;ee the more how far they carry it. A <HI>Pendet Brachman,</HI> or <HI>Heathen</HI> Doctor, whom I had put to &s;erve my <HI>Agah,</HI> at the entring into his Service would needs make his Panegyrick, and after he had compared him to the greate&s;t Conquerors that ever were, and told him an hundred gro&s;s and impertinent Flatteries, at la&s;t concluded &s;eriou&s;ly with this; <HI>When you put your Foot into the Stirrup, my Lord, and when you march on Hor&s;e-back in the front of the Cavalry, the Earth trembleth under your feet, the eight Elephants, that hold it up upon their Heads, not being able to &s;upport it.</HI> I could not hold laughing, and I &s;trove &s;eri|ou&s;ly to tell my <HI>Agah,</HI> who could not hold neither, that then he would do well not to go on Hor&s;e-back but very &s;eldom, to prevent Earthquakes, which often cau&s;e &s;o great Mi&s;chiefs. Who quickly made this Reparty with a con&s;trained Countenance between &s;erious and &s;miling: <HI>And it is therefore that I cau&s;e my &s;elf ordinarily to be carried in a Pale|key.</HI></P>
<P>But no more of this: from the great Hall of the <HI>Am-kas</HI> one enters into a more retired Place, called the <HI>Go&s;elkane,</HI> that is, the Place to wa&s;h in. But few are &s;uffered to enter there; neither is the Court of it &s;o great as that of the <HI>Am-kas:</HI> but the Hall is very hand&s;om, &s;pacious, painted and guilded, and its Floor rai&s;ed four or five foot high. There it is where the King is &s;eated in a Chair, his <HI>Omrahs</HI> &s;tanding round about him, and giveth a more particular Audience to his Officers, receiveth their Accompts, and treateth of the mo&s;t important Affairs of State. All the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are obliged to be with|out fail every evening at this A&s;&s;embly, as in the morning at the <HI>Am-kas;</HI> el&s;e &s;ome|thing is retrenched of their Pay. There is only my Agah <HI>Danechmend-kan,</HI> that becau&s;e he is a Per&s;on of Learning, and perpetually bu&s;ie in &s;tudying, or in foreign Affairs, is di&s;pen&s;ed with, except Wedne&s;day, which is his day of being upon the Guard. The&s;e are indi&s;pen&s;ible Cu&s;toms, and it is very ju&s;t they &s;hould be &s;o in re&s;pect of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> becau&s;e they are in a manner &s;o in re&s;pect of the King: for he almo&s;t never faileth to be at the&s;e two A&s;&s;emblies, unle&s;s &s;ome urgent Affair do &s;upervene, or he be exceeding &s;ick. And we did &s;ee, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> even in his la&s;t Sickne&s;s, which was very dangerous, failed not to make him&s;elf to be carried thither once a day at lea&s;t. It is true, he being &s;ick to extremity, that if he had not been &s;een there, the whole King|dom would pre&s;ently have been in di&s;order, and the Shops &s;hut up in the City.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King in this Hall of <HI>Go&s;le-kanay</HI> is bu&s;ie, as I was &s;aying, they omit not to let pa&s;s before him mo&s;t of the things that are made to pa&s;s at the <HI>Am-kas.</HI> There is only this difference, that this A&s;&s;embly being held in the evening, and the Court being then le&s;s, the review of the Cavalry of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> is not made, as in the morning at the <HI>Am-kas:</HI> but then there is this of particular, that all the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars</HI> that are upon the Guard do &s;alute the King, and pa&s;s before him with Ceremony enough: before them marcheth with &s;ufficient Pomp that which is called the <HI>Kours,</HI> which are many Figures of Silver carried at the end of &s;ome great &s;ilver Sticks, that are very fine and ve|ry artificially made; of which there are two that repre&s;ent two great Fi&s;hes, two o|thers that exhibit a phanta&s;tick Animal of an horrid figure, by them called <HI>Eiedeha;</HI> o|thers that repre&s;ent two Lions, others two Hands, others Scales, and many more where|of they make My&s;teries. Among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Kours</HI> and <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> are mixt many <HI>Gour|ze-berdars,</HI> or Mace-bearers, who are cho&s;en Men, tall of Stature, and of a good Mean, (&s;poken of el&s;ewhere) and appointed to prevent Di&s;orders in A&s;&s;emblies, and to run about with &s;peed to carry the Orders, and to execute the Commands of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="378">
I now wi&s;h I could lead you about in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> as I have done in the re&s;t of the Fortre&s;s: but who is the Traveller that can &s;peak of that as an Eye-witne&s;s? I have &s;ometimes entred into it when the King was not at <HI>Dehli,</HI> and I think pretty far, upon the occa&s;ion of a great Lady, that was &s;o &s;ick that &s;he could not be carried to the Gate, according to cu&s;tom; but I had always a Covering of <HI>Kachemire</HI> over my Head, which like a great Scarf hung down to my Feet, and an Eunuch conducted me by the Hand, like a blind Man, &s;o that I cannot particularly de&s;cribe to you what it is. Only in gene|ral I can tell you, according to what I have learnt from &s;ome Eunuchs, that in it there are very hand&s;om Apartments &s;evered one from another, more or le&s;s great and &s;tately, according to the Quality and the Pen&s;ions of the Women; that there is almo&s;t no Chamber but it hath at its Door a Store-hou&s;e of running Water; that 'tis full of Par|terres, plea&s;ant Walks, &s;hady Places, Rivolets, Fountains, Jets of Water, Grotta's, great Caves again&s;t the heat of the day, and great Terra&s;&s;es rai&s;ed high, and very airy, to &s;leep upon in the cool: in a word, you know not there what 'tis to be hot. They prin|cipally boa&s;t of a little Tower re&s;pecting the River, being, &s;ay they, covered with Plates of Gold, as tho&s;e two that are at <HI>Agra,</HI> and within all Gold and Azure, very hand&s;om and rich Pictures and Looking-gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This is very near what I can tell you of the Fortre&s;s, yet before we leave it, let us return once more to the <HI>Am-kas.</HI> I am now going to repre&s;ent it to you after the man|ner I &s;aw it at certain Fe&s;tivals of the Year, e&s;pecially at that which was kept after the War for an extraordinary rejoycing; for this is one of the mo&s;t remarkable things I have &s;een.</P>
<P>The King appeared &s;itting upon his Throne, in the bottom of the great Hall of the <HI>Am-kas,</HI> &s;plendidly apparelled. His Ve&s;t was of white Sattin flowred, and rai&s;ed with a very fine Embroidery of Gold and Silk. His Turban was of Cloth of Gold, having a Fowl wrought upon it like an Heron, who&s;e foot was covered with Diamonds of an extraordinary bigne&s;s and price, with a great Oriental Topas, which may be &s;aid to be matchle&s;s, &s;hining like a little Sun. A Collar of big Pearls hung about his Neck down to his Stomach, after the manner that &s;ome Heathens wear here their great Beads. His Throne was &s;upported by &s;ix high Pillars, or Feet, &s;aid to be of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, and &s;et with Rubies, Emeralds and Diamonds. I am not able to tell you aright, neither the number nor the price of this heap of precious Stones, becau&s;e it is not permitted to come near enough to count them, and to judge of their water and purity. Only this I can &s;ay, that the big Diamonds are there in confu&s;ion, and that the Throne is e&s;timated to be worth four <HI>Kouroures</HI> of Roupies, if I remember well. I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere, that a <HI>Roupie</HI> is almo&s;t equivalent to half a Crown, a <HI>Lecque</HI> to an hundred thou&s;and Rou|pies, and a <HI>Kourour,</HI> to an hundred Lecques: &s;o that the Throne is valued forty millions of Roupies, which are worth about &s;ixty millions of <HI>French</HI> Livers. <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> the Father of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> is he that cau&s;ed it to be made, to &s;hew &s;o many precious Stones as &s;ucce&s;&s;ively had been ama&s;&s;ed in the Trea&s;ury, of the Spoyls of tho&s;e ancient <HI>Patans</HI> and <HI>Rajas,</HI> and of the Pre&s;ents which the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are obliged to make yearly upon cer|tain Fe&s;tival days. The Art and Workman&s;hip of this Throne is not an&s;werable to the Matter: that which I find upon it be&s;t devi&s;ed, are two Peacocks covered with precious Stones and Pearls, which are the work of a <HI>French-man,</HI> called&mdash;that was an admirable Workman, and that after having circumvented many Princes with his Doub|lets, which he knew how to make admirably well, fled unto this Court, where he made his Fortune. Beneath this Throne there appeared all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> in &s;plendid Apparel, upon a rai&s;ed Ground covered with a great Canopy of purfled Gold with great golden Fringes, and inclo&s;ed by a &s;ilver Bali&s;tre. The Pillars of the Hall were hung with Ta|pe&s;tries of purfled Gold, having the ground of Gold; and for the roof of the Hall, there was nothing but great Canopies of flowred Sattin, fa&s;tened with red &s;ilken Cords, that had big tufts of Silk mixt with threads of Gold hanging on them. Below there was nothing to be &s;een but great &s;ilken Tape&s;tries very rich, of an extraordinary length and breadth. In the Court there was &s;et abroad a certain Tent they call the <HI>A&s;pex,</HI> as long and large as the Hall and more. It was joyned to the Hall by the upper part, and reached almo&s;t as far as to the middle of the Court; mean time it was all inclo&s;ed by a great Bali&s;tre covered with Plates of Silver. It was &s;upported by three Pillars, being of the thickne&s;s and height of a Barge-ma&s;t, and by &s;ome le&s;&s;er ones, and they all were co|vered with Plates of Silver. It was red from without, and lined within with tho&s;e fine <HI>Chittes,</HI> or Cloth painted by a Pencil of <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> purpo&s;ely wrought and contrived
<PB N="87" REF="378">
with &s;uch vivid Colours, and Flowers &s;o natural drawn of an hundred &s;everal fa&s;hions and &s;hapes, that one would have &s;aid, it were an hanging Parterre. Thus was the great Hall of the <HI>Am-kas</HI> adorned and &s;et out.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e arched Galleries, which I have &s;poken of, that are round about the Court, each <HI>Omrah</HI> had received order to dre&s;s one of them at his own charges. And they now &s;triving who &s;hould make his own mo&s;t &s;tately, there was &s;een nothing but pur|fled Gold above and beneath, and rich Tape&s;tries under foot.</P>
<P>The third day of the Fea&s;t, the King cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be weighed with great Cere|mony, and after him divers <HI>Omrahs,</HI> in great Scales, and with Weights &s;aid to be of ma&s;&s;ie Gold. I remember that all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> expre&s;&s;ed a great joy, that the King weighed two pounds more now than the year preceding.</P>
<P>Every year there are held &s;uch kind of Fe&s;tivals, but never any was &s;een done with &s;o much &s;plendor and charge. It is &s;aid, that that which induced <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> to celebrate this &s;plendid Fea&s;t, was nothing el&s;e but to make the Merchants of purfled Gold reco|ver them&s;elves, who had whole Magazins full of it, much &s;poiled in tho&s;e four or five years of War, wherein they could not &s;ell them. The&s;e Expences of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> were great; but the &s;imple Cavaliers paid their &s;hare of it, becau&s;e that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> after the Fea&s;t made them take off that Commodity to make Ve&s;ts thereof.</P>
<P>There is an ancient Cu&s;tom accompanying the&s;e Fea&s;ts, which little plea&s;eth the <HI>Om|rahs:</HI> And it is this, that then they are by re&s;pect obliged to make &s;ome fair Pre&s;ents to the King in proportion of their Pay. There are &s;ome, that to appear brave, or for fear of being &s;earched for the Rapines by them committed in their Offices and Govern|ments; or to purcha&s;e the Favour of the King, in the hopes of having their Pen&s;ions augmented, make him Pre&s;ents that are extraordinary. Some (which is ordinary enough) do pre&s;ent fine Ve&s;&s;els of Gold &s;et with precious Stones; others pre&s;ent fair Pearls, Diamonds, Emeralds, or Rubies; others (which al&s;o is very common) give him, without other Ceremony, a quantity of tho&s;e pieces of Gold, that are worth a|bout a Pi&s;tol and an half. I remember, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> being gone to vi&s;it (during this great Fe&s;tival) his Vi&s;ir <HI>Jafer-kan,</HI> not as Vi&s;ir, but as a Kin&s;man, and under the pretence of de&s;iring to &s;ee a piece of Building, which he had cau&s;ed to be rai&s;ed anew, <HI>Jafer-kan</HI> pre&s;ented him in the&s;e pieces of Gold, with the value of an hundred thou&s;and Crowns, &s;ome good Pearls, and one Ruby valued forty thou&s;and Crowns; but which <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who was admirably well skill'd in Jewels, di&s;covered not to be worth five hundred Crowns; the which perplexed the fir&s;t Jewellers exceedingly, that had been deceived therein.</P>
<P>There is another thing &s;ometimes attending the&s;e Fea&s;ts, which is odd enough: And that is a kind of Fair, then held in the <HI>Mehale,</HI> or the King's <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The Women of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and of the great <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> or little <HI>Omrahs</HI> (I mean tho&s;e that are the hand&s;ome&s;t and the mo&s;t gallant) are the She-Merchants that keep the Fair, and &s;ell Commodities; the King is the Merchant that buyeth, as al&s;o all tho&s;e <HI>Begums</HI> or Prin|ce&s;&s;es&punc; and other great Ladies of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The Wares are fine purfled Gold, or rich Embroideries of the new fa&s;hion, &s;ome rich Ribbons well wrought upon Cloth of Gold, or &s;ome pieces of that fine Cloth which is worn by the great Ladies, and other &s;uch Merchandize of great price. If they have ever a hand&s;om Daughter, they forget not to bring her along with them to let the King &s;ee her, and &s;o make her known to tho&s;e <HI>Begums.</HI> The je&s;t of this Fair is, that the King comes to bargain with tho&s;e She-Merchants, like a petty Merchant, penny by penny, conte&s;ting that they are not in ear|ne&s;t, that it is too dear, that he will give no more than &s;o much; that the Merchandize of &s;uch an one is far better, and the like. The Women, on the other hand, do their be&s;t to make good their part, and without con&s;idering that 'tis the King, (which is the be&s;t of the &s;port) they contend and &s;tand upon their price, till &s;ometimes they come to high words, as that that is to be a Merchant of Snow, (one of their phra&s;es) that he under&s;tands nothing in the matter of Wares, that he may go to another Place, that that Commodity is not for him, &amp;c. The <HI>Begums</HI> do the like, or wor&s;e, for they &s;ometimes fall to downright railing, &s;o that there is &s;uch a cry and noi&s;e, and boufonnery, that it cannot be parallel'd. But when any price is agreed on, who ever buyeth on this or that &s;ide, the King payeth, and the <HI>Begums</HI> pay, all with ready money: and it al&s;o falls out often enough, that the King and the <HI>Begums,</HI> in&s;tead of Silver Roupies, let &s;lide (in favour of the hand&s;om She-Merchant, or her Daughter) &s;ome Roupies of Gold, as if 'twere by mi&s;take, and without taking notice of any thing. The She-Merchants al&s;o
<PB N="88" REF="379">
take it in like manner, all pa&s;&s;eth with expre&s;&s;ions of rallery and gallantry. <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who did not hate the Sex, would &s;till multiply this Fair, and have it at all Fe|&s;tival days, though he knew it did not very well plea&s;e &s;ome <HI>Omrahs.</HI> But there is one thing, which to me &s;eems to be a little too extravagant; which is, that the publick Women, I mean not tho&s;e of the <HI>Bazar,</HI> but tho&s;e more retired and con&s;iderable ones, that go to the great marriages in the hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Man&s;eb-dars</HI> to &s;ing and dance, tho&s;e that are called <HI>Kenchen,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, the <HI>guilded,</HI> the <HI>blo&s;&s;oming</HI> ones; that tho&s;e, I &s;ay, did al&s;o enter in the time of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> into the <HI>Seraglio</HI> at &s;uch Fairs, and there pa&s;&s;ed even the whole night in &s;inging and dancing. The&s;e are not of that &s;ort which pro&s;titute them&s;elves promi&s;cuou&s;ly to all; and they are mo&s;t of them hand&s;ome and well apparelled, and excellent &s;ingers and dancers, after the mode of the Country, &s;urpri&s;ing in the &s;upplene&s;s of their body, and the nimblene&s;s of their motions, yet in the up&s;hot of the rank of Publick Women. <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was not content only to have them come to the Seraglio at tho&s;e Fea&s;ts, but when they came to &s;alute him, according to that antient cu&s;tom that obligeth them to come every Wed|ne&s;day to do obey&s;ance to the King in the <HI>Amkas,</HI> he often made them to enter there, and to pa&s;s all night with him in &s;uch &s;ports and boufonries, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is more &s;erious, he &s;uffers them not to come into the Seraglio: he permits only (not to abrogate the cu&s;t|om) that they may ordinarily come every Wedne&s;day to give him the <HI>Salam,</HI> or Salute, in the <HI>Am-kas,</HI> at a di&s;tance, but they mu&s;t pre&s;ently return home again.</P>
<P>But &s;ince we are upon the&s;e Fea&s;ts and Fairs, and &s;peak of the&s;e <HI>Kenchens,</HI> what hurt were it if I &s;hould tell you a &s;tory to make you merry, of one of our French Men; &s;ince <HI>Plutarch</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>little</HI> things are not always to be pa&s;&s;ed by, and that they often mind us more of the genius and temper of men than the <HI>greate&s;t.</HI> This French Man called <HI>Bernard,</HI> was at this Court about the latter years of King <HI>Jehan-Guire.</HI> He mu&s;t needs have been &s;ome good Phy&s;itian, and withal Excellent in Chirurgery, accord|ing to the relations that are made of him. He was welcome to <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> and be|came very familiar with him, to that degree that they drank&punc;and debauched together. Nor did this <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> ever think on any thing, but a good cup and merriment, leav|ing the management of the State to his Wife, the renowned <HI>Nour-Mehale,</HI> or <HI>Nour-Jehan-Begum,</HI> which he u&s;ed to &s;ay, had wit enough to govern the Empire without his giv|ing him&s;elf any trouble about it. Be&s;ides that this our Country-man had of the King ten Crowns daily pay, he gained yet more by treating tho&s;e great Ladies of the Seraglio, and the grand Omrahs, that all made u&s;e of him, and pre&s;ented him who could be&s;t, becau&s;e he was both &s;ucce&s;sful in his Cures, and extraordinarily favoured by the King: But he was a man that could keep nothing, what he received with one hand, he at the &s;ame time gave away with the other, &s;o that he was known and loved by all, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e <HI>Kenchens,</HI> upon whom he made great expences, having always a &s;et of them that pa&s;&s;ed the night at his hou&s;e in &s;inging and dancing. Mean time he chanced to fall in love with one of the&s;e Women that was young and beautiful, and danced exceeding well; but the Mother apprehending lea&s;t the Daughter, by pro&s;tituting her &s;elf, &s;hould lo&s;e her &s;trength and vigor (as it will fall out) would not let her go out of her &s;ight: &s;o that <HI>Bernard</HI> could never find any other way to compa&s;s his ends but this. One day when the King made him a Pre&s;ent in the <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kas,</HI> before all the Omrahs, for a con&s;i|derable Cure he had done in the Seraglio, he very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively gave his Maje&s;ty thanks, waving the Pre&s;ent, but in&s;tead of it, begged this favour of him, that he would vouch&s;afe to give him this young <HI>Kencheny,</HI> which he was amorous of, and which &s;tood behind him, ready to make the u&s;ual obey&s;ance to the King. The whole A&s;&s;embly brake out out into laughter to &s;ee him wave the Pre&s;ent, and to hear him make &s;o ridiculous a de|mand, he being a Chri&s;tian, and the Woman a Mahometan and a <HI>Kencheny.</HI> But <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> who never troubled his head much with Mahometani&s;m, and could not hold laughing aloud, pre&s;ently commanded that this young Woman &s;hould be given him, &s;aying, Lay her on his &s;houlders, and let him carry her away. So &s;aid, &s;o done; and in the pre&s;ence of the whole A&s;&s;embly this <HI>Kenchen</HI> was put on <HI>Bernard</HI>'s back, who went away thus charged, and carried her to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear giving you here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an account of a diverti&s;ement, which u&s;ually the&s;e Fea&s;ts end with, and which is unknown to us in <HI>Europe:</HI> and that is the <HI>combat</HI> of the <HI>Elephants,</HI> which the King, the Ladies of the Court, and the Omrahs do behold from &s;everal apartments of the Fortre&s;s, and which is &s;hewn before all the people in this great &s;andy place which looks to the River.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="379">
They rai&s;e a wall of earth three or four foot broad, and five or &s;ix foot high. The two Elephants that are to fight, meet one another face to face, one on the one &s;ide of the wall, the other on the other, each having two Riders upon him, that &s;o, if the fir&s;t, who &s;its on his &s;houlders (having a great pointed iron in his hand, to turn the Bea&s;t on the right or left hand) &s;hould fall, the other, who &s;its backward, may ca&s;t him&s;elf into his place. The&s;e four Riders or Guides, do animate their Elephants to the Combat, and vigorou&s;ly to fall upon their enemy, now flattering them, and by and by chiding them as cowards, and very rudely kicking them with their heels. After they have been a good while thus chafed and pu&s;ht on, then you &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e two bulky ma&s;&s;es come to the wall, and bluntly a&s;&s;ault one another, and give &s;uch cruel blows with their teeth, head and trunk, that you would think they would &s;oon &s;trike one another dead. This fight continues a while, then cea&s;eth, and begins afre&s;h &s;everal times, until the mud|wall being overthrown, the &s;toute&s;t of the two pa&s;&s;eth upon the other, maketh him turn his back, pur&s;ueth him with blows of his teeth and trunk, and gets &s;uch an hold|fa&s;t upon him, that there is no means of &s;eperating them, except it be with the <HI>Cher|kys,</HI> that is, certain artificial fires ca&s;t betwixt them, this Animal being very fearful of fire: whence it comes, that &s;ince Fire-arms have been u&s;ed in Armies, Elephants do almo&s;t no good at all. It is true indeed, that &s;ome of tho&s;e brave ones that come out of <HI>Ceilan,</HI> are not &s;o timerous; but that is not till they have been whole years accu&s;tomed to it, by di&s;charging every day Muskets before them, and by ca&s;ting &s;quibs between their legs. Mean time, this conflict of the Elephants would be no &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ing fight, if it were not &s;o cruel, it often happening, that &s;ome of tho&s;e poor Guides are trod under foot and peri&s;h: for the Elephants in the combat have this malice, that they &s;trive above all things to &s;trike with their trunk, and to pull down the conductor of their ad|ver&s;ary; and thence it is, that on the day when the&s;e poor Riders know they are to make the Elephants fight, they bid farewel to their Wives and Children, as if they were con|demned to death. That which encourages and comforts them, is, that if they e&s;cape and quit them&s;elves well of their duty, the King increa&s;es their pay, and commands a &s;ack of <HI>Pey&s;&s;as,</HI> which amounts to about fifty French Livres, to be forthwith given them, or if they be killed upon the &s;pot, he orders that pay to be made to the Widow, and the Office to be given to his Son, if he have any. There is another mi&s;chief, which of|ten accompanieth this combat; which is, that in this great throng there are always &s;ome per&s;ons overthrown by the Elephant, or trod under foot by the Hor&s;es and People, that on a &s;udden run away all at once, and fall one upon another, when the Elephants are enraged, and the one pur&s;ueth the other, &s;o that then one cannot at any nearne&s;s look on but with danger. For my part, the &s;econd time I &s;aw it, I did &s;ufficiently repent for having approached &s;o nigh, and if I had not had a good Hor&s;e, and two good Servants, I believe I &s;hould have paid for my curio&s;ity as dear as others.</P>
<P>But 'tis time we &s;hould leave the Fortre&s;s, and return into the City, there to ob&s;erve to you two things I had forgot. The fir&s;t is the great <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> &s;een afar off in the mid&s;t of the Town, &s;tanding upon a rock, flatted to build upon, and to make round a|bout a large place for four long and fair Streets to end upon, and an&s;wering to the four &s;ides of the Mo&s;quee, <HI>viz.</HI> one to the principal Gate, or Fronti&s;piece, another behind that, and the two others to the two Gates that are in the middle of the two remaining &s;ides. To come to the Gates, there are twenty five or thirty &s;teps of fair and large Stones going round about, except the back-part, which is covered with other great Quarry-&s;tones to cover the unevene&s;s of the cut Rock: which contributes much to make this Fabrick make a &s;hew. The three Entries are &s;tately, there is nothing but Marble, and their large Gates are covered with Copper Plates exceedingly well wrought. Above the principal Gate, which is much &s;tatelier than the two others, there are many &s;mall Turrets of white Marble as well without as within; that in the middle is much big|ger and higher than the two others. All the re&s;t of the Mo&s;quee, I mean from the&s;e three Domes unto the great Gate, is without covering, becau&s;e of the heat of the Coun|try; and the whole Pavement is of large &s;quares of Marble. I grant willingly, that this &s;tructure is not according to the rules and orders of Architecture, which we e&s;teem is indi&s;pen&s;ably to be followed; yet I ob&s;erve nothing in it that offends the eye; but rather find all to be well contrived, and well proportioned: And I do even believe, that if in <HI>Paris</HI> we had a Church of this way of Architecture, it would not be di&s;liked, if there were nothing el&s;e in it but that'tis of an extraordinary and &s;urpri&s;ing a&s;pect, and becau&s;e that, excepting the three great Domes and all the Turrets, which are of
<PB N="90" REF="380">
white Marble it appears all red, as if all were nothing el&s;e but great Tables of red Marble, though it be nothing el&s;e but a &s;tone very ea&s;ie to cut, and which even flaketh off in time. I &s;hall add by the by, that if it be true what is &s;aid of the quarries of this &s;tone, 'tis remarkable, that it grows again every year; whether it be by a petre&s;cent water yearly filling it, or otherwi&s;e, I decide not.</P>
<P>This Mo&s;quee it is to which the King repaireth every Friday (which is the Sunday of the Mahumetans) to pay his devotion. Before he goes out of the Fortre&s;s, the Streets he is to pa&s;s, are con&s;tantly watered becau&s;e of the heat and du&s;t. Two or three hundred Mu&s;quetiers are to &s;tand and make a lane about the Gate of the Fortre&s;s, and as many more on the &s;ides of a great Street that ends at the Mo&s;quee. Their Mu&s;|quets are &s;mall, but well wrought, and they have a kind of Scarlet-ca&s;e with a little &s;treamer upon them. Be&s;ides there mu&s;t be five or fix Cavaliers well mounted ready at the Gate, and ride at a good di&s;tance before the King, for fear of rai&s;ing du&s;t; and their office is to keep off the people. Things being thus prepared, the King is &s;een to come out of the Fortre&s;s &s;eated upon an Elephant richly harna&s;&s;ed, under a Canopy with Pillars painted and guilded; or el&s;e on a Throne &s;hining of Gold and Azure, upon two beams, covered with Scarlet or purfled Gold, carried by eight cho&s;en and well accou|tred men. The King is followed by a body of Omrahs, &s;ome of which are on hor&s;e-back, &s;ome in a <HI>Palekey.</HI> Among the&s;e Omrahs there are many <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> and Mace-Bearers, &s;uch as I have before &s;poken of. And though this be not that &s;olendid and magnificent Proce&s;&s;ion, or rather Ma&s;carade of the Grand Seignior, (I have no pro|perer name for it) nor the warlike order of our Kings, it being altogether of another fa&s;hion, yet for all that there is &s;omething great and royal in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> thing I had forgot to acquaint you with, is an Edifice in the City, called the <HI>Karvan&s;arab</HI> of the Prince&s;s; the renowned <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> elde&s;t Daughter of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> having cau&s;ed it to be built at her charges, and willing to contribute &s;omething to the decoration of the Town, as all the Omrahs &s;trove to do to plea&s;e <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> This is another great Square, arched like our <HI>Palace-Royal,</HI> but &s;till with this difference, that one Arch is &s;eparate from the other by a wall, and that in the bottom of every Arch there is a little Chamber; and be&s;ides that, above the Arches there is a Gallery which rangeth round about the building, to enter into as many high Chambers, as there are below. This Place is the Rendezvous of all the great Merchants, <HI>Per&s;ians, &V;sbecks,</HI> and other Strangers that ordinarily do <HI>there</HI> find empty Chambers convenient enough, to &s;tay in for &s;ome time in great &s;afety, the Gate being &s;hut every night. If there were a &s;core of &s;uch Structures in divers parts of <HI>Paris,</HI> Strangers newly arri|ving would not be in that trouble, as often they are to find &s;afe Lodgings; for <HI>there</HI> they might be until they had &s;een their Acquaintance, and looked for good Accomoda|tion: be&s;ides that they would &s;erve for Magazins of all &s;orts of Commodities, and for the Rendezvous of all Merchants Strangers.</P>
<P>Before we leave <HI>Dehli,</HI> I &s;hall add a few lines in reference to this que&s;tion, which doubtle&s;s you'l make, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether in <HI>Dehli</HI> there be as much People and Gallantry as at <HI>Paris?</HI> Certainly when I con&s;ider tho&s;e three or four Cities of <HI>Paris</HI> that are one a|bove another, all tho&s;e Chambers and other Rooms full from top to bottom; when I farther con&s;ider that incredible throng and confu&s;ion of Men and Women, of Hor&s;e-men and Pa&s;&s;engers on foot, of Chariots, Sedans and Coaches, and that there are but few great Piazzas and Gardens in <HI>Paris;</HI> this City &s;eems to me a Nur&s;ery of the World, and I can hardly believe, that there are as many People in <HI>Dehli.</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding when I reflect upon that multitude of Shops on one &s;ide of <HI>Dehli,</HI> and on the other, upon the va&s;t extent of that City, and that there are never le&s;s in it then 35000 Cavaliers, not to &s;peak of the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> that of all the&s;e Cavaliers, there are very few but have Wives and Children, and a great number of Servants having their Hou&s;es apart as their Ma&s;ters; and that all the&s;e Hou&s;es &s;warm with Women and Children: that in many places of <HI>Dehli,</HI> though the Streets be broad, and there be but few Chariots and no Coaches, yet at the hours when the heat &s;uffers People to come abroad for their bu&s;ine&s;s, there is great confu&s;ion: When (I &s;ay) I con&s;ider all this on the other hand, I do not well know what to determine about the que&s;tion, and I imagine, that if there be not altogether &s;o much People in <HI>Dehli</HI> as in <HI>Paris,</HI> at lea&s;t there wants not much of it.</P>
<P>Concerning the number of gallant People, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there is this difference between tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> that of ten Per&s;ons met with upon the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee &s;even or eight well cloathed and of &s;ome fa&s;hion, which
<PB N="91" REF="380">
no Man will count ra&s;cally or beggerly People; whereas in <HI>Dehli,</HI> for two or three Per&s;ons that are pretty well covered, you &s;hall always find &s;even or eight poor and rag|ged People; the Army which is there drawing after it all that crew of Beggers and Ra&s;cals. Yet this is to be acknowledged for a truth, that in <HI>Dehli,</HI> as well as in <HI>Paris,</HI> one meets with a very great quantity of Per&s;ons well made, gallant, well mounted, well dre&s;&s;ed, and well attended: And indeed, to be upon the great Place before the Fortre&s;s at the hours when all tho&s;e Omrahs, Rajas, and Man&s;eb-dars go to the A&s;&s;embly and to the Guard, that hath &s;omething, great and &s;plendid in it: when you &s;hall &s;ee there every where arrive tho&s;e <HI>Man&s;eb-dars</HI> well accoutred, &s;hining with Gold, and well mounted, a couple of Men going before them to make place, and as many behind; when you &s;hall al&s;o &s;ee many of tho&s;e great <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas</HI> riding upon proud Elephants, and &s;ome of them on Hor&s;e-back like the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> and mo&s;t of them &s;itting in their rich <HI>Palekys,</HI> carried upon the &s;houlders of &s;ix men, their back leaning again&s;t &s;ome thick Cu&s;hion of purfled Gold, chewing their <HI>Betele,</HI> to have a good breath and vermilion lips, with a Servant on the &s;ide carrying a Tooth-pick, and a Porcelain or &s;ilver Spit|ting-Ve&s;lel; and two more, fanning him and keeping off the flies and du&s;t from him with Peacocks-tails; and three or four others marching before to put by the People; to which is to be added part of their Cavalry (I mean the brave&s;t and be&s;t mounted of them) following after: When, I &s;ay, all this is &s;een together marching, as hath been &s;aid, with the crowd made there as well as at <HI>Paris,</HI> it will not be denied to be &s;ome|thing great and very gallant.</P>
<P>As to the Country about <HI>Dehli,</HI> it is con&s;iderable for its fertility; for it beareth Rice, Millet, and three or four other &s;orts of Legumes, (which is the ordinary food of the common People) Corn, Sugar, Indigo, and all that in abundance. At two leagues off the City on <HI>Agra's</HI> &s;ide, in a place by the Mahumetans called <HI>Koja Kotubeddine,</HI> there is a very antient Edifice which hath been a Temple of Idols, where are In&s;criptions that mu&s;t al&s;o be very antient, the Characters of them being &s;uch that no body knows what they are, and different from tho&s;e of all the Languages of the Indies,</P>
<P>On another &s;ide, at two or three leagues di&s;tance from the Town, you &s;ee an Hou&s;e of plea&s;ure of the Kings, which indeed is a &s;tately and Royal Hou&s;e, but yet you mu&s;t not think it approach to <HI>Fontain-bleau,</HI> or to St. <HI>Germain,</HI> or to <HI>Ver&s;aille.</HI> Neither mu&s;t you imagine that in this Campagne of <HI>Dehli</HI> there are any <HI>St. Cloux, Chantilly</HI>'s, <HI>Meudons, Liancours, Vaux, Ruelles,</HI> and many &s;uch others; or that you &s;ee there any of tho&s;e o|ther inferior Hou&s;es of plea&s;ure belonging to &s;imple Gentlemen, Citizens and Merchants. The Maxime, That the Subjects of a Kingdom have no propriety in any thing, hinders all that.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, to make you pa&s;s quickly tho&s;e fifty or &s;ixty leagues, which are betwixt <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> you are not to think, that upon this road you &s;hall &s;ee any &s;uch large and rich burroughs as there upon our roads. Set a&s;ide <HI>Maturas,</HI> where you &s;ee &s;till an antient and &s;tately Temple of Idols, and excepting &s;ome <HI>Karavan-&s;arrahs,</HI> that are well enough, found on the high-way to &s;erve for night-lodgings, I find nothing con&s;iderable there, but that Royal Alley of Trees planted by the command of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> and continued by the &s;ame order for an hundred and fifty leagues, with little Pyramids or Turrets erected every half league, to mark the ways, and with frequent wells to afford drink to Pa&s;&s;engers, and to water the young Trees.</P>

<P>TO pa&s;s to the de&s;cription of <HI>Agra,</HI> you have the <HI>Idea</HI> of it, if you have well taken that of <HI>Dehli;</HI> at lea&s;t in re&s;pect of its &s;eituation, which is al&s;o upon the Gemma, and in regard of the Fortre&s;s, or Royal Hou&s;e, and of mo&s;t of the Buildings. It is true, that <HI>Agra</HI> hath this advantage over <HI>Dehli,</HI> that being a City where the Kings have already re&s;ided a long while, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ince <HI>Akber,</HI> who cau&s;ed it to be built, and called it after his name <HI>Akber-abad,</HI> it is of greater extent then <HI>Dehli,</HI> and hath more of tho&s;e fine Hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas,</HI> and more of the fair <HI>Karvan&s;arrahs,</HI> as al&s;o more of tho&s;e pretty Hou&s;es of Stone and Brick belonging to particular Per&s;ons; be&s;ides that it hath two famous Tombs, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter: But then it hath the&s;e di&s;advantages, that it wants Walls; that having been built altogether by one de&s;ign, it hath not tho&s;e fair and large Streets of uniform buildings as <HI>Dehli;</HI> and that excepting four or five of tho&s;e principal Streets of Merchants, which are very long and well
<PB N="92" REF="381">
enough built, all the re&s;t for the mo&s;t part, is nothing but a number of little Streets, &s;treight without proportion, and nothing but windings and turnings; which cau&s;es &s;trange confu&s;ions when the Court is there. I &s;ee no other difference between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> then that I have been ju&s;t now &s;peaking of; except it be that <HI>Agra</HI> hath more of a Country Town then <HI>Dehli,</HI> e&s;pecially when we look upon it from an higher place: But 'its not &s;uch a Country-a&s;pect as di&s;graceth it, but a very agreeable and diverti&s;ing one; for, there being betwixt the Hou&s;es of <HI>Omrahs,</HI> Rajas and others, &s;tore of big green Trees mixt, every one having been curious to plant of them in his Garden and in his Court for &s;hade; and be&s;ides, tho&s;e high Hou&s;es of the <HI>Banians,</HI> or Heathen Merch|ants, appearing here and there between tho&s;e Trees, as Reliques of old Ca&s;tles of For|re&s;ts; all that cau&s;eth within the Town very plea&s;ing &s;ights and per&s;pectives, e&s;pecially in a dry and hot Country, where Peoples eyes &s;eem to de&s;ire nothing but verdure and &s;hade.</P>
<P>Mean time you need not go out of <HI>Paris,</HI> to find the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and the mo&s;t gal|lant &s;ight in the World. Take onely a walk upon the <HI>Pontneuf,</HI> attentively beholding in the day-time all things &s;urrounding you, together with that incredible and &s;trange con|fu&s;ion of People: and at night the infinite number of lights in the windows, of tho&s;e high buildings that are round about you; and the &s;ame confu&s;ion which continues till after mid-night; the good Citizen, and (which you &s;hall not &s;ee in any part of <HI>A&s;ia)</HI> the fair She-Citizen walking without fear of Robbers, and without the inconvenience of dirt: and then the long files of Stars that brave the wind, the rain and darkne&s;s. Take only, I &s;ay, &s;uch a walk upon that Bridge, ob&s;erving all tho&s;e things together, and then (upon my word) you may boldly maintain it, that you are upon the &s;pot of the faire&s;t, brave&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent artificial view of the Earth, unle&s;s it be &s;ome part of <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> where I have not been. What will it be then when the <HI>Louvre,</HI> that work which was once thought would never be &s;een but in de&s;igu and upon paper, &s;hall be fini&s;ht? I have purpo&s;ely added the word <HI>Artificial,</HI> becau&s;e &s;peak|ing of the be&s;t Per&s;pectives that are, we mu&s;t always except <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> when one is in a Boat in the mid&s;t of that great Channel, over again&s;t the point of the <HI>Seraglio:</HI> For <HI>there</HI> you &s;hall find your &s;elf altogether &s;urprized, as 'twere in the mid&s;t of &s;ome great and va&s;t inchanted Amphitheater; but in this Per&s;pective the Workman&s;hip of <HI>Nature</HI> is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, whereas in that of <HI>Paris; Art</HI> and <HI>Dexterity</HI> is mo&s;t con&s;picuous, which doubtle&s;s renders it more eminent, fora&s;much as thereby it looks more like the Seat of a great King, the Capital of a great Empire, and is really, without flattering our &s;elves, and all tho&s;e beauties of <HI>Debli, Agra,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> well con&s;idered and compared, the &s;aire&s;t, the riche&s;t, and the chiefe&s;t City of the World.</P>
<P>In <HI>Agra</HI> the Reverend Fathers the Je&s;uits have a Church and a Colledge, where in pri|vate they teach the Children of &s;ome twenty five or thirty Chri&s;tian families, that have (I know not how) gathered and &s;ettled them&s;elves there by the charity of tho&s;e Fathers the Chri&s;tian Doctrine. It was <HI>Ekbar</HI> who (in the time of the great power of the <HI>Per|tuguezes</HI> in the <HI>Indies)</HI> called them, and gave them a pen&s;ion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, per|mitting them to build Churches in the capital Cities of <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Lahor.</HI> And his Son <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> favoured them yet more. But <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> Son of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> and Fa|ther of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> now reigning, took from them their pen&s;ion, cau&s;ed their Church at <HI>Lahor</HI> to be pulled down, and the greate&s;t part of that in <HI>Agra,</HI> overthrowing al&s;o the Steeple of the Church, wherein that Bell was that could be heard over all the Town.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fathers the Je&s;uits entertained great hopes of the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity in the time of King <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> becau&s;e of his contempt of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law, and the e&s;teem he profe&s;&s;ed to the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> even giving way to two of his Nephews to em|brace the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to a certain <HI>Mirza-Zul-Karmin</HI> (that had been bred in the Seraglio, and was circumci&s;ed) to turn Chri&s;tian too, under the pretence that he born of Chri&s;tian Parents, and Son of the Wife of a rich <HI>Armenian,</HI> which <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> had cau&s;ed to be brought to him into the Seraglio.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Fathers &s;ay, that this King, to begin in good earne&s;t to countenance the Chri&s;tian Religion, de&s;igned to put the whole Court into the habit of the <HI>Franqui,</HI> and that after he had prepared all things for it, and even dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in that fa&s;hion, he called to him one of the chief Omrahs, asking his opinion of this dre&s;s; but that this Omrah altogether &s;urprized at it, having an&s;wered him very &s;eriou&s;ly, that it was a very dangerous thing, he thought him&s;elf obliged to change his mind, and turned all into raillery.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="381">
The&s;e Fathers affirm further, that he being upon the point of death, comm anded that they &s;hould be called to make him a Chri&s;tian, but that then they were not made acquainted with it. Many &s;ay, that this is not &s;o, and that he died as he had lived, without any Religion, and in the de&s;ign he had, as well as his Father <HI>Ekbar,</HI> to &s;et him&s;elf up for a Prophet, and to become the Head of a particular Religion of his own compo&s;ure. However it be, there is another thing I have learned of a Mahumetan, that was Son to an Officer of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> namely, that this King being one day in a debauche, called to him a certain Religious man of <HI>Florence,</HI> whom he called Fa|ther <HI>Atech,</HI> as being a little fiery man; and after he had commanded him to &s;ay all he could <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Law of Mahumet, and <HI>for</HI> the Law of Chri&s;t, in the pre&s;ence of ma|ny knowing <HI>Mullahs,</HI> he would have made this terrible tryal of both tho&s;e Laws, <HI>viz</HI> That a great Pit &s;hould be made, and a good Fire in it, and that Father <HI>Atech</HI> with the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> under his arm, and one of tho&s;e <HI>Mullahs</HI> with the <HI>Alcoran</HI> under his, &s;hould ca&s;t them&s;elves both together into that fire, and that he would embrace the Law of him that &s;hould not burn. But that the &s;ad countenance of the <HI>Mullahs,</HI> altogether a&s;toni&s;ht, and the compa&s;&s;ion he had of the <HI>Florentine</HI> Father, who accepted the condition, divert|ed him from it. Whatever the truth be of this &s;tory, 'tis certain, that whil&s;t <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> lived, the&s;e Fathers were re&s;pected and honoured in this Court, and that they conceived great hopes of the advancement of Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e parts; but that &s;ince that time they have had no great cau&s;e to hope much of it, except perhaps what they received by that familiarity, which our Father <HI>Buz&eacute;</HI> had with <HI>Dara.</HI> But I &s;hall &s;ay no more of this matter of our Mi&s;&s;ions, intending to give you a particular long Letter of it another time.</P>
<P>Certainly I cannot but exceedingly approve of Mi&s;&s;ions, and the good Mi&s;&s;ionaries, e&s;pecially our <HI>Capucins</HI> and <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and &s;ome others of our neighborhood, becau&s;e they give meek in&s;tructions, without that indi&s;creet zeal and tran&s;port which is expre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome others, and they charitably entertain the Chri&s;tians of the Country in their Reli|gion, whether they be Catholicks, or Greeks, or Armenians, Ne&s;torians, Jacobites, or others; and fora&s;much al&s;o as they are the refuge and comfort of poor Strangers and Travellers, and by their knowledge, &s;ober and exemplary life, they confound the igno|rance and licentious life of the Infidels: which &s;ome others do not always practi&s;e; who therefore would do better to keep them&s;elves clo&s;e in their Convents, and not come hi|ther and give us a ma&s;quarade of our Religion, and by doing &s;o, and by their ignorance, jealou&s;ie, loo&s;ne&s;s, and the abu&s;e of their authority and character, become a &s;tumbling|block to the Law of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> But a particular thing infers no general; and notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e mi&s;carriages, I very much applaud the Mi&s;&s;ions, and pious and learned Mi&s;&s;ionaries, they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: it is the honour and prerogative of Chri&s;ti|anity, to have every where thorow the World Sub&s;titutes of the Apo&s;tles. But after all that I have &s;een, and after all the conver&s;e and di&s;cour&s;e I have &s;o often had with tho&s;e ob&s;tinate Infidels, I may take leave to &s;ay, that I almo&s;t de&s;pair to &s;ee &s;truck &s;uch great &s;troaks, as the Apo&s;tles did, who converted two or three thou&s;and People in one Sermon: finding by experience, and knowing very well upon other accounts, after I have travelled through all the places of the Mi&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> that all the Mi&s;&s;ionaries together, not only in the Indies, but in all the Mahumetan Dominions, do indeed by their In&s;tructions, accompanied with Charity and Alms, made &s;ome progre&s;s among the <HI>Gentils,</HI> but do in ten years not make one Chri&s;tian of a <HI>Mahumetan.</HI> Truly the&s;e <HI>In|fidels</HI> have high thoughts of our Religion, they never &s;peak of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> but with great veneration; and they never pronounce the word <HI>Ay&s;a,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> without adding that of <HI>Azeret,</HI> which is <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> They even agree with us, that he was mira|culou&s;ly born of a Virgin-Mother, and that he is the <HI>Kelum-Allah,</HI> and the <HI>Rouh-Allah,</HI> the Word of God, and the Spirit of God: but 'tis not to be hoped, that they will approve the re&s;t of our Religion, &s;o as to abandon theirs in which they were born, and their fal&s;e Prophet, to embrace ours, what rea&s;ons &s;oever be given them. Our Chri&s;tians of <HI>Europe</HI> ought to wi&s;h, and even to employ their Power, Care and Charity, that Mi&s;&s;i|onaries may be &s;ent over all, &s;uch as may be no charge to the People of the Country, and whom want may not induce to do mean things, as well for the rea&s;ons already al|ledged, as for this cau&s;e, that they may be ever ready to lay hold on all occa&s;ions, always to bear witne&s;s to the Truth, and to labour in the Vineyard when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to give them an overture. But for the re&s;t we ought to be di&s;abu&s;ed, and not to &s;uffer our &s;elves to be &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;waded of &s;o many &s;tories, and not to believe the thing to
<PB N="94" REF="382">
be &s;o facit as &s;ome make it. The Sect is too much libertine, and too attractive to quit it; it is a pernitious Law, which hath been introduced by Arms and Force, and &s;till gets ground by tho&s;e means: and I hardly know any other way capable to &s;hake and root it out. If therefore there intervene not &s;ome of tho&s;e grand and extraordinary &s;troaks of Heaven, and God by his powerful and particular Providence interpo&s;e not, (as we ought always to hope, according to the great appearance there have been in <HI>China,</HI> in <HI>Japan,</HI> and in the Per&s;on of King <HI>Jehan-Guire)</HI> con&s;idering the irreverence of the Chri&s;tians in their Churches, &s;o di&s;&s;onant from our belief of the particular pre&s;ence of God upon our Altars, and &s;o different from that deep and a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;pect which tho&s;e Infidels bear to their Mo&s;quees, where they would not &s;o much as turn their heads, or &s;peak the lea&s;t word to one another; there will alwayes be great ob&s;tacles to their Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>In <HI>Agra</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have al&s;o an Hou&s;e, where ordinarily they keep four or five per&s;ons. Formerly they had a good trade there in &s;elling Scarlet, great and &s;mall Looking-gla&s;&s;es, plain Lace, and Gold and Silver Lace, and &s;ome &s;mall Wares; and in buying <HI>Indigo,</HI> which is gathered round about <HI>Agra,</HI> but e&s;pecially at <HI>Bianes,</HI> but two leagues di&s;tant from it, and whither they go once a year, having an hou&s;e there for that purpo&s;e; as al&s;o in buying tho&s;e cloths of <HI>Jelapour</HI> and <HI>Laknau,</HI> at &s;even or eight days journey from <HI>Agra,</HI> where they al&s;o keep an hou&s;e, and whither they &s;end &s;ome Factors once a year. But now they &s;ay, that there is little profit for them in that trade, whether it be that the <HI>Armenians</HI> drive the &s;ame traffick, or that 'tis &s;o far from <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Suratte,</HI> or that commonly &s;ome mi&s;chief or other befalls their <HI>Caravanes,</HI> which mu&s;t pa&s;s by <HI>Amada|vad</HI> over all the Countries of the <HI>Rajas</HI> to avoid the ill ways, and the mountains that are on the &s;ide of <HI>Gonleor</HI> and <HI>Brampour,</HI> which is the nearer way. Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couragements, they will never (I believe) abandon this Factory, as the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> have done theirs in that place, if it were for nothing el&s;e but their Spices, which there they &s;ell very well, and for having &s;ome of their People near the Court taking care of their concerns: &s;ince it cannot be otherwi&s;e, but that frequently &s;ome trouble will befal their Factories by the tyranny of the Governors and other Officers, now from the &s;ide of <HI>Bengala</HI> and <HI>Patna,</HI> another time from <HI>Suratte</HI> and <HI>Amadavad.</HI></P>
<P>We will conclude this part with tho&s;e two wonderful <HI>Mau&s;olees,</HI> or Tombs, that give to <HI>Agra</HI> &s;o much advantage over <HI>Dehli.</HI> It was <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> that cau&s;ed the fir&s;t to be erected to honour the memory of his Father <HI>Eckbar;</HI> and <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> rai&s;ed the other in honour of <HI>Taje-Mehale</HI> his Wife, that extraordinary and celebrated Beauty of the In|dies, whom he loved &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, that 'tis &s;aid, he never enjoyed any other Woman but her whil&s;t &s;he lived, and that when &s;he died, he was in danger to die him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;tay to di&s;cour&s;e of the Monument of <HI>Eckbar,</HI> becau&s;e whatever beauty is there, is found in a far higher degree in that of <HI>Taje-Mehale,</HI> which I am now going to de&s;cribe unto you. You may there&s;ore repre&s;ent to your &s;elf, that at the going out of the City of <HI>Agra</HI> Ea&s;t-ward, you enter into a long and broad paved &s;treet, which ri&s;eth gently, and hath on one &s;ide an high and long wall, making the &s;ide of a &s;quare Garden that is much bigger then our <HI>Palace-Royal;</HI> and on the other &s;ide a row of new hou&s;es arched, &s;uch as are tho&s;e of the principal Streets of <HI>Dehli</HI> above &s;poken of. Having gone the length of half the Wall, you &s;hall find on the right hand of the &s;ide of the Hou&s;es a great Gate well made, by which one enters into a <HI>Carvan-&s;erah,</HI> and over again&s;t it on the walls &s;ide, a &s;tately Gate of a great &s;quare Pavilion, by which you enter into the Garden between two Con&s;ervatories built up with Free&s;tone. This Pavilion is longer then 'tis large, built of a Stone like red Marble, but not &s;o hard. The Fron|ti&s;piece &s;eems to me very magnificent after their way, and as high as that of St. <HI>Louys</HI> in the Street of St. <HI>Antony.</HI> It is true, you do not there &s;ee Columns, Archi-traves, and Corni&s;hes cut out after the proportion of tho&s;e Five Orders of Architecture &s;o re|ligiou&s;ly ob&s;erved in our Palaces: it is a different and particular kind of &s;tructure, but &s;uch an one as wants no agreeablene&s;s even in the unu&s;ualne&s;s of its contrivance, and which in my opinion, would very well de&s;erve a place in our Books of Architecture. 'Tis almo&s;t nothing but Arches upon Arches, and Galleries over Galleries, di&s;po&s;ed and or|dered an hundred different ways; and yet all appears &s;tately, well enough contrived and managed. There is nothing that offends the eye; on the contrary all is plea&s;ing, and a man cannot be weary in beholding it. The la&s;t time I &s;aw it, I was there with one of our French Merchants, who al&s;o could not behold it enough. I dur&s;t not tell him my thoughts of it, apprehending I might have &s;poiled my gu&s;t, and framed it accord|ing
<PB N="95" REF="382">
to that of <HI>Indo&s;tan:</HI> but he being lately come from <HI>France,</HI> I was very glad to hear him &s;ay, he had never &s;een any thing &s;o augu&s;t and bold in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>After you are &s;omewhat entred into the Pavilion to pa&s;s into the Garden, you find your &s;elf under an high Vault made like a Cap, which hath Galleries above round about and below, on the right and left &s;ide two Divans or Cau&s;eys, made up of earth of eight or ten foot high. Oppo&s;ite to the Gate there is a great Arch quite open, by which you enter into an Alley, which cuts almo&s;t the whole Garden into two equal parts. This Alley is by way of terra&s;&s;e &s;o large, as that &s;ix Coaches can pa&s;s on it abre&s;t, paved with great &s;quares of hard Stone, rai&s;ed &s;ome eight foot high above the Garden|plots, and divided in the middle by a Channel walled up with Free-&s;tone, having jets of water at certain di&s;tances. After you have gone twenty five or thirty paces upon this Alley, turning your eye to behold the Entry, you &s;ee the other face of the Pavilion, which though it be not comparable to that which looks to the Street, yet wants not its &s;tateline&s;s, being high and of a &s;tructure approaching the other. And on both &s;ides of the Pavilion, along the wall of the Garden, you &s;ee a long and profound gallery by way of terra&s;&s;e, &s;upported by many low columns near one another. And in this Gal|lery 'tis, that during the &s;ea&s;on of the rains, the Poor are permitted to enter, who come there thrice a week, receiving Alms from a foundation made there by <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>Advancing further in this Alley, you di&s;cover at a di&s;tance before you a great <HI>Dome,</HI> where is the Sepulchre, and below on the right and left hand you &s;ee divers Alleys of a Garden &s;et with Trees, and &s;everal Parterres covered with Flowers. At the end of this Alley, be&s;ides the Dome before you, you di&s;cover on the right and left two great Pavilions, built of the &s;ame Stone, and con&s;equently looking all red as the fir&s;t. The&s;e are great and &s;pacious &s;quare Edifices, made by way of Terra&s;&s;e, opening by three Ar|ches, and having at the bottom the wall of the Garden, &s;o that you march under them as if they were high and large Galleries.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;tay to de&s;cribe unto you the Ornaments within the&s;e Pavilions, becau&s;e in re&s;pect of their Walls, Ground-plot, and Pavement, they are not much unlike the Dome, which I am going to delineate unto you, after I &s;hall have ob&s;erved, that be|tween the end of the Alley (which we have &s;poken of) and the Dome, there is a pret|ty large &s;pace of a floor, which I call a Water-Parterre, becau&s;e that the diver&s;ly cut and figured Stones you march upon, are there in&s;tead of the Box-Wood of <HI>our</HI> Parterres. And 'tis from the mid&s;t of this Parterre, that you may conveniently &s;ee a part of this Edifice, where the Sepulchre is, which remains now to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It is a great and va&s;t <HI>Dome</HI> of white Marble, which is near the height of that of our <HI>Val de Grace</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;urrounded with many Turrets of the &s;ame matter with Stairs in them. Four great Arches &s;upport the whole Fabrick, three of which are vi&s;ible, the fourth is clo&s;ed in by the wall of an Hall, accompanied with a Gallery, where certain <HI>Mullahs</HI> (entertained for that end) do continually read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> with a profound re&s;pect to the honour of <HI>Taje-Mehalle.</HI> The mould of the Arches is inriched with Tables of white Marble, wherein are &s;een engraven large <HI>Arabian</HI> Chara|cters of black Marble, which is very agreeable to behold. The interior or concave part of this Dome, and the whole wall from top to bottom is covered with white Marble; and there is no place which is not wrought with Art, and hath not its peculiar Beauty. You &s;ee &s;tore of Agat, and &s;uch &s;orts of Stones, as are employed to inrich the Chappel of the great Duke of <HI>Florence;</HI> much Ja&s;per, and many other kinds of rare and pretious Stones, &s;et a hundred &s;everal ways, mixt and encha&s;ed in the Marble that covers the body of the Wall. The Quarries of white and black Marble, that make the floor, are likewi&s;e &s;et out with all imaginable beauty and &s;tateline&s;s.</P>
<P>Under this Dome is a little Chamber inclo&s;ing the Sepulchre, which I have not &s;een within, it not being opened but once a year, and that with great Ceremony, not &s;uf|fering any Chri&s;tian to enter, for fear (as they &s;ay) of Prophaning the Sanctity of the place: but really by what I could learn, becau&s;e it hath nothing rich or magnificent in it.</P>
<P>There remains nothing el&s;e, then to give you occa&s;ion to take notice of an Alley in the fa&s;hion of a Terra&s;&s;e, twenty or twenty five ordinary paces large, and as many or more high; which is betwixt the Dome and the extremity of the Garden, whence you &s;ee below you, at the foot of it, the River of <HI>Gemna</HI> running along, a great campagne of Gardens, a part of the Town of <HI>Agra,</HI> the Fortre&s;s, and all tho&s;e fair Hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> that are built along the water. There remains no more, I &s;ay, then to cau&s;e you to ob&s;erve this <HI>Terra&s;&s;e,</HI> which taketh up almo&s;t the whole length of one &s;ide of the
<PB N="96" REF="383">
Garden, and then to de&s;ire you to judge, whether I had rea&s;on to &s;ay, that the <HI>Mau&s;ole|um,</HI> or Tomb of <HI>Taje-Mehale,</HI> is &s;omething worthy to be admired. For my part, I do not yet well know, whether I am not &s;omewhat infected &s;till with <HI>Indiani&s;me;</HI> but I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that I believe it ought to be reckoned among&s;t the wonders of the World, rather then tho&s;e un&s;hapen ma&s;&s;es of the Aegyptian Pyramids, which I was weary to &s;ee after I had &s;een them twice, and in which I find nothing <HI>without,</HI> but pieces of great Stones ranged in the form of &s;teps one upon another, and <HI>within</HI> nothing but very little Art and Invention.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I &s;hould live whole ages, I know not whether I could ever forget tho&s;e two Eclip&s;es of the Sun, of which I &s;aw one in <HI>France</HI> in the Year 1654. and the o|ther in the <HI>Indies</HI> at <HI>Delhi</HI> in the Year 1666. if I remember aright. The former &s;eemed very remarkable to me upon the account of the childi&s;h credulity of our common people; and of that pannick terror which had &s;o &s;eized the heart, that &s;ome bought Drugs again&s;t the Eclip&s;e; others kept them&s;elves clo&s;e in the dark in their Caves, and their well-clo&s;ed Chambers; others ca&s;t them&s;elves in great multi|tudes into the Churches: <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> apprehending &s;ome malign and dangerous influence, and <HI>the&s;e</HI> believing that they were come to their la&s;t day, and that the Eclip&s;e would &s;hake the foundations of Nature, and overturn it, notwith&s;tanding any thing that the <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI>'s, <HI>Robervals,</HI> and many other famous Philo&s;ophers could &s;ay or write again&s;t this per&s;wa&s;ion, when they demon&s;trate, that this Eclip&s;e was of the &s;ame nature with &s;o many others that had preceded without any mi&s;chief, and that it was a known acci|dent, fore&s;een and ordinary, which had nothing peculiar, but what &s;ome cheating A&s;trological Mountebanks might have devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>That which I &s;aw at <HI>Dehli</HI> &s;eemed al&s;o very con&s;iderable to me, by rea&s;on of the ri|diculous Errors and Super&s;titions of the <HI>Indians.</HI> At the time when the &s;aid Eclip&s;e was to appear, I went up to the Terra&s;&s;e of my hou&s;e, which was &s;cituate on the &s;ide of the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> thence I &s;aw both &s;ides of the River, for near a league in length, covered with the Heathen Idolaters, that &s;tood in the water up to their girdle, demure|ly looking up into the sky, to the end that they might plunge and wa&s;h them&s;elves at the moment when the Eclip&s;e &s;hould begin. The little Boys and Girls were &s;tark naked; the men were almo&s;t &s;o too, but that they had a kind of &s;carf round about their thighs to cover their nakedne&s;s: and the married Women, together with the young Maids that were not above &s;ix or &s;even years old, were covered with a &s;ingle cloth. Per&s;ons of condition, as the <HI>Rajas,</HI> or &s;overaign Princes of tho&s;e Gentils, (who commonly are about the Per&s;on, and in the pay of the King) and the <HI>Serrahs</HI> or Exchangers, the Banckers, Jewellers, and other great Merchants, were mo&s;t of them gone to the other &s;ide of the water with all their family, and had there put up their Tents, and fa&s;tned in the River certain <HI>Kanates,</HI> which are a kind of skreens, to perform their Ceremonies, and conve|niently to wa&s;h them&s;elves with there Wives, &s;o as not to be &s;een by others. The&s;e Ido|laters no &s;ooner &s;aw the Eclip&s;e begin, but they rai&s;ed a great cry, and all at once plunged them&s;elves wholly into the water, I know not how many times one after another; &s;tand|gin
<PB N="97" REF="383">
up afterwards in the water, and lifting up their eyes and hands to Heaven, muttering and praying with great devotion, and from time to time taking water with their hands, which they threw up towards the Sun, bowing down their heads very low, moving and turning their arms and hands &s;ometimes one way, &s;ometimes another, and thus continuing their plunging, praying and api&s;hne&s;s unto the end of this Eclip&s;e; at which time every one retired, ca&s;ting &s;ome pieces of Silver a good way off into the wa|ter, and giving alms to the <HI>Brachmans</HI> or men of the Law, who failed not to be at that Ceremony. I took notice, that at their going out of the water, they all took new cloathes that were laid ready for them folded up on the &s;and, and that many of the de|vouter &s;ort left there their old garments for the Brachmans. And in this manner did I &s;ee from my Terra&s;&s;e this great &s;olemnity of the Eclip&s;e; which was celebrated after the &s;ame manner in the River <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> and in all the other Rivers, as al&s;o in the Receivers of water in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but e&s;pecially in that of the <HI>Tanai&s;er,</HI> where were met together above an hundred and fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons, come together from all parts of the Indies, becau&s;e the water of it is on that day reputed more holy and effi|cacious than on any other.</P>
<P>The great Mogol, though he be a Mahumetan, &s;uffers the&s;e Heathens to go on in the&s;e old &s;uper&s;titions, becau&s;e he will not, or dareth not cro&s;s them in the exerci&s;e of their Religion, and be&s;ides it is not performed without pre&s;enting him, by the hands of the <HI>Brachmans</HI>as Commi&s;&s;ioners, a <HI>Lecque</HI> or an hundred thou&s;and Roupies, which are worth above fifty thou&s;and Crowns, for which he returns nothing but a few Ve&s;ts and an old Elephant. Now you &s;hall &s;ee tho&s;e &s;olid rea&s;ons (for&s;ooth) which they alledge for this Fea&s;t, and for the Ceremonies by them ob&s;erved in it.</P>
<P>We have (&s;ay they) our four <HI>Beths,</HI> that is, Books of the Law, Sacred and Divine Writings, given us by God through the hands of <HI>Brahma.</HI> The&s;e Books do teach us that a certain <HI>Deuta,</HI> which is a kind of corporeal Divinity, very malign and mi&s;|chievous, very black and very filthy (the&s;e are their own expre&s;&s;ions in their language) &s;eizeth on the Sun, blackens it as 'twere with ink, and &s;o darkens it: <HI>That</HI> this Sun, which is al&s;o a <HI>Deuta,</HI> but of the be&s;t and the mo&s;t beneficent and perfect Divinities, is at that time in very great pains and terrible angui&s;h, to &s;ee him&s;elf thus &s;eized on and mi&s;u&s;ed by that black villain: That 'tis a general duty to endeavour to deliver him from this mi&s;erable condition; which cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e effected but by the force of prayers, wa&s;hings and alms, and that the&s;e actions are of a very extraordinary merit to &s;uch a degree, that an alms given at that time is worth an hundred given at another. Who is there, &s;ay they, that would not give <HI>cent pour cent?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, the&s;e are the two Eclip&s;es I &s;poke of which I &s;hall hardly ever forget, and which mini&s;ter occa&s;ion to me to proceed to &s;ome other extravagancies of the&s;e Gentils, whence you may draw what con&s;equences you &s;hall plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Town of <HI>Jagannat,</HI> which is &s;eated upon the Gulf of <HI>Bengala,</HI> and where is that famous Temple of the Idol of the &s;ame name, there is yearly celebrated a certain Fea&s;t, which la&s;ts eight or nine days, if I remember well. There is found an incredible number of people, as there was antiently in the Temple of <HI>Hammon,</HI> and as 'tis at this day at <HI>Mecca.</HI> This number, 'tis &s;aid, amounts &s;ometimes to above an hundred and fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons. They make a &s;tately Engin of wood, as I have &s;een of them in many other places of the Indies, with I know not how many extravagant figures, almo&s;t &s;uch as we are wont to paint Mon&s;ters with two heads or bodies, half man and half bea&s;t, or gigantick and terrible heads, Satyrs, Apes or Devils; which Engin is put up|on fourteen or &s;ixteen wheels, &s;uch as the Carriages of Cannons may be, which fifty or &s;ixty per&s;ons more or le&s;s do draw, or thru&s;t forwards: Upon the middle of it appears mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly the Idol <HI>Jagannat,</HI> richly dre&s;&s;ed and adorned, which is thus tran&s;|ported from one place to another.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day that they &s;hew this Idol with Ceremony in the Temple, the crowd is u&s;ually &s;o great to &s;ee it, that there is not a year, but &s;ome of tho&s;e poor Pilgrims, that come afar off, tired, and hara&s;&s;ed, are &s;uffocated there; all the people ble&s;&s;ing them for having been &s;o happy, as to die on &s;o holy an occa&s;ion. And when this Helli&s;h Triumphant Chariot marcheth, there are found (which is no Fable) per&s;ons &s;o fooli&s;h|ly credulous and &s;uper&s;titious as to throw them&s;elves with their bellies under tho&s;e large and heavy wheels, which brui&s;e them to death, having &s;uffered them&s;elves to be per|&s;waded, that there is no action &s;o heroick nor &s;o meritorious as that, and that <HI>Jagennat</HI> will at the &s;ame time receive them as his Children, and cau&s;e them to be born again in a &s;tate of felicity and glory.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="384">
The <HI>Brachmans</HI> for their particular advantage and intere&s;t, I mean that of Alms and Re&s;pect given to them as Per&s;ons devoted to the&s;e My&s;teries, do entertain the People in the&s;e errors and &s;uper&s;titions, and they proceed even to &s;uch infamous cheats and Villanies, that I could never have believed them, if I had not fully informed my &s;elf of it. The&s;e Impo&s;tors take a young Maid, of the faire&s;t they can meet with, to be the Bride (as they &s;peak, and bear the be&s;otted people in hand) of <HI>Jagannat,</HI> and they leave her all night in the Temple (whither they have carried her) with the Idol, making her believe that <HI>Jagannat</HI> him&s;elf will come and embrace her, and appointing her to ask him, Whether it will be a fruitful Year, what kind of Proce&s;&s;ions, Fea&s;ts, Prayers and Alms he demands to be made for it. In the mean time one of the&s;e lu&s;tful Prie&s;ts enters at night by a little back-door into the Temple, deflowreth this young Maid, and maketh her believe any thing he plea&s;eth; and the next day, being tran&s;|ported from this Temple into another with the &s;ame magnificence, &s;he was carried be|fore upon the Chariot of Triumph on the &s;ide of <HI>Jagannat</HI> her Bridegroom; the&s;e <HI>Brachmans</HI> make her &s;ay aloud before all the people, what&s;oever &s;he had been taught of the&s;e Cheats, as if &s;he had learnt it from the very mouth of <HI>Jagannat.</HI> But let us go on (if you plea&s;e) to follies of another kind.</P>
<P>Before this Chariot, and often in the very Temples of the Idols, on Fe&s;tival days, you &s;hall &s;ee publick Women dance, making an hundred indecent and extravagant po|&s;tures; and yet the <HI>Brachmans</HI> find a way to accord all that with their Religion. I have &s;een &s;ome Women, that are not only famous for their beauty, but al&s;o for great re&s;er|vedne&s;s, which refu&s;ed very con&s;iderable pre&s;ents of certain Mahumetans and Chri&s;ti|ans, and even of Heathen &s;trangers, as if they were only dedicated to the Mini&s;tery and the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Deura,</HI> or the Idol Temple to the <HI>Brachmans</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Fakires,</HI> which are there &s;eated mo&s;t of them upon a&s;hes round about, altogether naked with their fearful hair of <HI>Megera,</HI> and in the po&s;ture I &s;hall &s;peak of hereafter. But let us &s;tay no longer upon the&s;e follies.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many Writers of voyages relating the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, burning them&s;elves with their Husbands, that I think &s;omething will at la&s;t be believed of it. For my part, I am going to take my turn al&s;o, and to write to you of it like others; yet in the mean time ob&s;erving withall, that 'tis not all true what is &s;aid of it, and that now they do not burn them&s;elves in &s;o great a number as formerly, becau&s;e the Mahumetans, that bear &s;way at pre&s;ent in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> are enemies to that barbarous cu&s;tom; and hinder it as much as they can; not oppo&s;ing it ab&s;olutely, becau&s;e they are willing to leave their idolatrous people, who are far more numerous then them&s;elves, in the free exerci&s;e of their Religion, for fear of &s;ome revolt: but by indirectly prevent|ing it, in that they oblige the Women, ready to burn them&s;elves, to go and ask per|mi&s;&s;ion of the re&s;pective Governors, who &s;end for them, make conver&s;e with their own Women, remon&s;trate things to them with annexed promi&s;es, and never give them this permi&s;&s;ion, but after they have tryed all the&s;e gentle ways, and till they find them fixt in their &s;otti&s;h re&s;olution. Which yet hinders not but that many burn them&s;elves, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that live upon the Lands of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> where no Mahumetan Gover|nors are. I &s;hall not &s;tay to give you the hi&s;tory of all tho&s;e, which I have &s;een burn them&s;elves; that would too be long, and too tedious: I &s;hall only relate unto you two or three Examples of them, whence you may judge of the re&s;t; but fir&s;t you &s;hall have the relation of a Woman, which I was &s;ent unto to divert her from &s;uch a mi&s;chievous de&s;ign.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, called <HI>Bendidas,</HI> the fir&s;t Clerk of my <HI>Agah Danechmend-kan,</HI> died of an Hectick, having been treated by me above two years. His Wife immediately re|&s;olv'd to burn her &s;elf, together with the Body of her Husband; but her Parents, by the order of my <HI>Agah,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervants they were, endeavour'd to di&s;&s;wade her from it, repre&s;enting to her, that though it were indeed a generous and laudable re&s;olution, and would be a great honour and happine&s;s in the Family, yet &s;he ought to con&s;ider, that her Children were yet little, that &s;he could not abandon them, and that &s;he was to prefer their good, and the affection &s;he had for them, to the love &s;he had for her Hu&s;|band, and to her own &s;atisfaction. The&s;e Parents not having been able to prevail with her by all the&s;e repre&s;entments, bethought them&s;elves to de&s;ire me to go to her, as &s;ent from my <HI>Agah,</HI> and as an antient friend to the Family. I went and when I came, I did, as &s;oon as I came in, &s;ee a clu&s;ter of &s;even or eight fearful old Women, together with four or 5 infatuated and brain-&s;ick <HI>Brachmans,</HI> who all cried by turns, beating their hands
<PB N="99" REF="384">
about the dead Corps, and the Widow in her loo&s;e hair, looking pale, yet with dry and &s;parkling Eyes, &s;itting and crying al&s;o aloud, and beating her Hands, as the re&s;t with a kind of Cadency, upon the Feet of her Husband. The out-cry and noi&s;e being ended, I approach'd to this Company of people, and addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to the Widow, I gave her &s;oftly to under&s;tand, that I came from <HI>Danechmend-kan;</HI> that he had appointed a monthly Pen&s;ion of two Crowns, to each of her two Sons, but on condition that &s;he &s;hould not burn her &s;elf, to the end, that &s;he might take care of them, and breed them up as was fit; that el&s;e we knew ways enow to hinder her from burning her &s;elf, if &s;he were ob&s;tinate for it, and to make tho&s;e repent, that &s;hould allure and incite her to &s;uch an unrea&s;onable re&s;olution, e&s;pecially &s;ince none of her Kindred was &s;atisfied with it, and that &s;he would not be counted infamous, as tho&s;e are that want the re&s;olution to burn them&s;elves after the death of their Husbands, when they have no Children. I often inculcated to her all the&s;e con&s;iderations, without hearing a word of an&s;wer from her; though at la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, looking fiercely upon me: Well, if I am hindred to burn my &s;elf, I am re&s;olved to break my head again&s;t the Wall. Then &s;aid I by my &s;elf; What Di|abolical fury doth po&s;&s;e&s;s thee? And to her I an&s;wer'd, full of indignation: Then take thy Children, thou unhappy Creature, and cut their Throats, and burn them with thee; for they will be &s;tarved, I being now ready to return to <HI>Danechmend-kan,</HI> and to annull their Pen&s;ion. The&s;e words being &s;poken by me, with the loude&s;t and mo&s;t menacing tone I could, made impre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;pirit of this Woman, and upon that of all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tants: She pre&s;ently, without any reparty, let her Head &s;ink down upon her knees, and mo&s;t of the old Women and <HI>Brachmans</HI> went away. Whereupon her Relations, that were come with me, entred and parlied with her. And I, thinking I had done enough, took Hor&s;e, and came away to my Lodgings, &s;uppo&s;ing they would do the re&s;t well enough. In &s;hort, about evening, when I was going to give an account to my <HI>Agah</HI> of what I had done, I met with her Parents, who thank'd me, and &s;aid, that the dead Corps had been burnt, and the Widow per&s;waded to remain alive.</P>
<P>Concerning the Women that have actually burn'd them&s;elves, I have &s;o often been pre&s;ent at &s;uch dreadful &s;pectacles, that at length I could endure no more to &s;ee it, and I retain &s;till &s;ome horrour when I think on't. Yet I &s;hall repre&s;ent to you &s;ome of them, but pretend not to expre&s;s to the life, with what courage and re&s;olution the&s;e poor Women atchieved &s;uch a direful Tragedy; for there is nothing but the Eye it &s;elf that can exhibit a right <HI>idea</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>When I was pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Amadevad</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> over the Lands of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> that are in tho&s;e parts, there came news to us in a Burrough, where the Caravane re&s;ted under the &s;hade (&s;taying for the cool of the evening, to march on in their journey) that a certain Woman was then upon the point of burning her &s;elf with the Body of her Hu&s;|band. I pre&s;ently ro&s;e and ran to the place where it was to be done, which was a great Pit, with a Pile of wood rai&s;ed in it, whereon I &s;aw laid a dead Corps, and a Woman, which at a di&s;tance &s;eem'd to me pretty fair, &s;itting near it on the &s;ame Pile; be&s;ides four or five <HI>Brachmans,</HI> putting the Fire to it from all &s;ides; five Women of a middle age, and well enough dre&s;&s;ed, holding one another by the Hand, and dan|cing about the Pit, and a great Crowd of People, Men and Women, looking on. The Pile of Wood was pre&s;ently all on fire, becau&s;e &s;tore of Oyl and Butter had been thrown upon it, and I &s;aw at the &s;ame time through the flames, that the Fire took hold of the Cloaths of the Woman, that were imbued with well-&s;ented Oyls mingled with Powder of Santal and Saffron. All this I &s;aw, but ob&s;erved not, that the Woman was at all di&s;turbed; yea, it was &s;aid, that &s;he had been heard to pronounce with great force the&s;e two words, <HI>Five, Two,</HI> to &s;ignifie, according to the Opinion of tho&s;e that hold the Souls Tran&s;migration, that this was the 5<HI>th.</HI> time &s;he had burnt her &s;elf with the &s;ame Husband, and that there remain'd but <HI>two</HI> times for perfection; as if &s;he had at that time this Remembrance, or &s;ome Prophetical Spirit. But here ended not this Infernal Tragedy: I thought it was only by way of ceremony, that the&s;e five Women &s;ung and danced about the Pit; but I was altogether &s;urpri&s;ed, when I &s;aw, that the flame having taken hold of the cloaths of one of them, &s;he ca&s;t her &s;elf with her Head foremo&s;t into the Pit, and that, after her, another, being overcome by the flame and &s;moak did the like: And my a&s;toni&s;hment redoubled afterwards, when I &s;aw, that the remaining three took one another again by the Hand, continued their dance without any apparent fear, and that at length they precipitated them&s;elves, one after another into the fire, as their companions had done. It troubled me &s;ufficiently, that I knew not what that
<PB N="100" REF="385">
meant; but I learnt &s;hortly after, that the&s;e had been five Slaves, who, having &s;een their Mi&s;tre&s;s extreamly afflicted at the &s;ickne&s;s of her Husband, and heard her promi&s;e him, that &s;he would not &s;urvive him, but burn her &s;elf with him, were &s;o touch'd with compa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s towards this their Mi&s;tre&s;s, that they engaged them&s;elves in a promi&s;e to follow her in her re&s;olution, and to burn them&s;elves with her. Many per|&s;ons, whom I then con&s;ulted about this cu&s;tome of Women burning them&s;elves with the Bodies of their Husbands, would per&s;wade me, that what they did was from an exce&s;s of affection they had for them: But I under&s;tood afterwards, that it was only an effect of Opinion, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and cu&s;tome; and that the Mothers, from their youth be&s;ot|ted with this &s;uper&s;tition, as of a mo&s;t vertuous and mo&s;t laudable action, &s;uch as was unavoidable to a Woman of honour, did al&s;o infatuate the &s;pirit of their Daughters from their very infancy: Although, at the bottom, it was nothing el&s;e but an Art of the Men, the more to en&s;lave their Wives, thereby to make them have the more care of their health, and to prevent poi&s;oning of them.</P>
<P>But let us proceed to another Tragedy, which I &s;hall rather repre&s;ent to you than many others, at which I have been pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it hath &s;omething uncommon in it. 'Tis true, I was not there my &s;elf; but you may do as I, who do not &s;tand out a|gain&s;t crediting the&s;e things, becau&s;e I have &s;een &s;o many of them which &s;eem'd incredi|ble to me. This action is grown &s;o famous in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that no body doubts of it, and it may be, that even your &s;elf have already heard of it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis of a Woman, that was engaged in &s;ome Love-intrigues with a young Mahume|tan her Neighbour, that was a Tailor, and could play finely upon the Tabor. This Woman in the hopes &s;he had of marrying this young man, poi&s;on'd her Husband, and pre&s;ently came away to tell her Tailor, that it was time to be gone together as they had projected, or el&s;e that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to burn her &s;elf. The young Man fearing, le&s;t he might be entangled in a mi&s;chievous bu&s;ine&s;s, flatly refu&s;ed her. The Woman, not at all &s;urprized at it, went to her Relations, and adverti&s;ed them of the &s;udden death of her Husband, and openly prote&s;ted that &s;he would not &s;urvive him, but burn her &s;elf with him. Her Kindred well &s;atisfied with &s;o generous a re&s;olution, and the great honour &s;he did to the whole Family, pre&s;ently had a Pit made, and filled with Wood, expo&s;ing the Corps upon it, and kindling the Fire. All being prepar'd, the Woman goes to embrace and bid farewell to all her Kindred that were there about the Pit, among whom was al&s;o the Tailor, who had been invited to play upon the Tabor that day, with many others of that &s;ort of Men, according to the cu&s;tome of the Coun|try. This fury of a Woman being al&s;o come to this young Man, made as if &s;he would bid him farewell with the re&s;t; but in &s;tead of gently embracing him, &s;he taketh him with all her force about his Collar, pulls him to the Pit, and tumbleth him together with her &s;elf into the Ditch, where they both were &s;oon di&s;patch't.</P>
<P>She which I &s;aw burn her &s;elf, when I parted from <HI>Suratte</HI> to travel into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chardin</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> and of many Engli&s;h and Dutch, was of a middle age and not unhand&s;ome. To repre&s;ent unto you the undaunted chearfulne&s;s, that appear'd in her countenance, the re&s;olution with which &s;he marched, wa&s;h'd her &s;elf, &s;poke to the people; the confidence with which &s;he look'd upon us, view'd her little Cabin, made up of very dry Millet-&s;traw and &s;mall Wood, went into this Cabin, and &s;ate down upon the Pile, and took her Husband's Head into her Lap, and a Torch into her own Hand, and kindled the Cabin, whil&s;t I know not how many <HI>Brochmans</HI> were bu&s;ie in kindling the fire round about: To repre&s;ent unto you, I &s;ay, all this, as it ought, is not po&s;&s;ible for me; I can at pre&s;ent &s;carce believe it my &s;elf, though it be but a few days &s;ince I &s;aw it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that I have &s;een &s;ome of them, which at the &s;ight of the Pile and Fire, appear'd to have &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, and that perhaps would have gone back, but 'tis often too late: Tho&s;e Demons, the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> that are there with their great Sticks, a&s;toni&s;h them, and hearten them up, or even thru&s;t them in; as I have &s;een it done to a young Woman that retreated five or &s;ix paces from the Pile, and to another that was much di&s;turbed when &s;he &s;aw the Fire take hold of her Cloaths, the&s;e Executioners thur&s;ting her in with their long Poles. Yet I have often &s;een one, that is &s;till a hand|&s;ome Woman, and had &s;aved her &s;elf out of their Hands, falling into the Hands of the <HI>Gadous,</HI> that &s;ometimes meet there in great numbers, when they know that 'tis &s;ome fair and young Woman that is to be burnt, and that hath no great Kindred, nor much Company with her: For the Women that are afraid of the Pile, and fly away from it,

knowing that they cannot be received again among&s;t the Gentiles, nor live with them, becau&s;e they repute them infamous, after they have committed &s;uch a fault, and brought &s;uch a di&s;grace upon their Religion, &s;uch Women, I &s;ay, are ordinarily the prey of this kind of Men, who are al&s;o counted infamous in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that have nothing to loo&s;e. A <HI>Mogolian</HI> dur&s;t not &s;ave, nor receive any, for fear of bringing him&s;elf into great trouble. Some <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rtugue&s;es</HI> living in Sea-ports, where they were &s;tronge&s;t, have &s;ometimes carried away &s;ome of them. For my part, I have often been &s;o enraged a|gain&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Brahmans,</HI> that if I dur&s;t, I had &s;trangled them. I remember, among o|thers, that at <HI>Lahor,</HI> I &s;aw a very hand&s;ome and a very young Woman burn'd: I be|lieve &s;he was not above twelve years of age. This poor unhappy Creature appear'd rather dead then alive, when &s;he came near the Pile; &s;he &s;hook, and wept bitterly: Mean time three or four of the&s;e Executioners, the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> together with an old Hag, that held her under the Arm, thru&s;t her on, and made her &s;it down upon the Wood, and lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould run away, they tied her Legs and Hands, and &s;o burn'd her alive. I had enough to do to contain my &s;elf for indignation; but I was forced to content my &s;elf with dete&s;ting this horrid Religion, and to &s;ay by my &s;elf, what the Poet once &s;aid of &s;uch another, upon the occa&s;ion, of <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> whom her own Father <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> &s;acrificed to <HI>Diana,</HI> for the intere&s;t of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> among&s;t whom he was one of the principal Leaders.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Tantum Religio potuit &s;uadere malorum!</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e are certainly very barbarous and very cruel Cu&s;tomes, but that which the <HI>Brah|mans</HI> do in &s;ome other places of the <HI>Indies</HI> is yet more &s;o: For in&s;tead of burning tho&s;e Women that will dye upon the death of their Husbands, they bury them in the ground alive up to the very Throat, and then two or three of them fall at once upon them, and wring their Neck round, and &s;o choak them, covering them quickly with &s;ome earth, and then marching over their Heads. But let us pa&s;s to &s;ome other Cu&s;tomes of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Gentiles burn their dead; but &s;ome there are, that do no more than with &s;ome Straw broil them on a Rivers &s;ide, ca&s;ting them thereupon from the height of a &s;teep Bank into the Water: Which I have often &s;een upon the River <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Gentiles there are, who, when they perceive a &s;ick per&s;on near death carry him to the &s;ide of a River (at which barbarous action I have been once pre&s;ent) and then fir&s;t put his Feet into the Water, and afterwards let him &s;lide down as far as to his Throat, and then when they think he is now expiring, they &s;ink him quite un|der Water, and there leave him, after they have made a great clamour, and clapping with their Hands: And this, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> to the end that the Soul leaving the body may be wa&s;h'd from all the impurities, &s;he may have contracted in the Body. And this is not only a rea&s;on given by the Vulgar; for I have &s;poken with the mo&s;t Learned of them, who deliver'd the &s;ame with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. But let us go on to other extravagan|cies.</P>
<P>Among&s;t that va&s;t number and great variety of <HI>Fakires, Derviches,</HI> or Religous Hea|thens of the Indies, there is abundance of them that have Convents, in which there are Superiours, and wherein they make certain vows of Cha&s;tity, Poverty, and Obedience, leading &s;o odd a life, that I doubt whether you can give credit to it. The&s;e are com|monly called <HI>Jauguis,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>&V;nited to God.</HI> You &s;hall &s;ee many of them &s;it &s;tark naked, or lie days and nights upon A&s;hes, and commonly enough, under &s;ome of tho&s;e large trees, that are on the &s;ides of the <HI>Talabs</HI> or Ponds, or el&s;e in tho&s;e Gal|leries that are about their <HI>Deuras</HI> or Idol-temples. Some of them have their Hair hang|ing down to the middle of their Legs, and that wreathed into &s;everal parcels, as the large Main of our Barbes, or rather as the Hair of tho&s;e that have the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Poland</HI> cal|led the <HI>Plica.</HI> Of the&s;e I have &s;een &s;ome in divers places, who held one Arm, and &s;ometimes both, lifted up perpetually above their Heads, and that had at the end of their Fingers wreathed Nails, that were longer by mea&s;ure than half my little finger. Their Arms were &s;mall and lean as of hectical per&s;ons, becau&s;e they took not &s;ufficient nou|ri&s;hment in that forced po&s;ture, and they could not let them down to take any thing with them, either meat or drink, becau&s;e the Nerves were retired, and the Joints were filled and dried up: wherefore al&s;o they have young Novices, that &s;erve them as Holy men with very great re&s;pect. There is no <HI>Megera</HI> in Hell &s;o terrible to look on, as tho&s;e Men are, all

naked, with their black skin, long Hair, dried Arms, and in the po&s;ture mention'd, and with crooked Nails.</P>
<P>I have often met in the Field, e&s;pecially upon the Lands of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> whole &s;qua|drons of the&s;e <HI>Faquires,</HI> altogether naked, dreadful to behold. Some held their Arms lifted up in the po&s;ture mention'd; others had their terrible Hair hanging about them, or el&s;e they had wreathed them about their Head; &s;ome had a kind of <HI>Hercules's</HI> Club in their Hand; others had dry and &s;tiff Tiger-skins over their Shoulders. I &s;aw them pa&s;s thus quite naked, without any &s;hame, through the mid&s;t of a great Burrough, I admired how Men, Women, and Children could look upon them &s;o indifferently, with|out being moved no more than if we &s;hould &s;ee pa&s;s &s;ome Eremite through our &s;treets; and how the Women brought them almes with much devotion, taking them for very holy Men, much wi&s;er and better than others.</P>
<P>I have &s;een for a long while a very famous one in <HI>Dehli,</HI> called <HI>Sarmet,</HI> who went thus &s;tark naked along the &s;treets, and who at length would rather &s;uffer his Neck to be cut off, than to put on any cloaths, what promi&s;es or menaces &s;oever <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> might &s;end to him.</P>
<P>I have &s;een <HI>many</HI> of them, who out of devotion went long Pilgrimages, not only al|together naked, but charged with Iron-chains, like tho&s;e that are put about the Legs of Elephants. <HI>Others,</HI> who, out of a particular vow, &s;tood for &s;even or eight days up|right upon their Legs, which thereupon &s;well'd as big as their Thighs, without &s;itting or lying down, or without repo&s;ing them&s;elves otherwi&s;e than by leaning &s;ome hours of the night upon a &s;tretched Cord: <HI>Others,</HI> who &s;tood for whole hours upon their Hands without wavering, the Head down, and the Feet upward: And &s;o of many others &s;orts of po&s;tures &s;o con&s;train'd, and &s;o difficult, that we have no Tumbler able to immitate them; and all this it &s;eems upon the account of Religion, of which yet their appears not the lea&s;t &s;hadow in it.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;o extraordinary things did (to tell you the truth) exceedingly &s;urprize me at fir&s;t, I knew not what to &s;ay or think of it. Sometimes I look'd upon them as a re|mainder, or rather as the Authors of that antient and infamous Sect of the <HI>Cynicks,</HI> but only that I found nothing in them, but brutality and ignorance, and that they &s;eem'd to me a kind of Trees, &s;omewhat moving from one place to another, rather than rati|onal Animals. Another time I con&s;ider'd them as Men altogether Enthu&s;ia&s;tical; though as I lately &s;aid, I could not find any &s;hadow of true Piety in all they did. Some|times I thought, that this lazy, idle, and independent Life of Beggars might have &s;omething attractive in it. Sometimes I imagin'd that the vanity, which creeps in every where, and which is as often found under the patched Mantle of <HI>Diogenes,</HI> as under the comely Garment of <HI>Plato,</HI> there might lurk that Spring, which might &s;et a going &s;o many Engins; and then reflecting withal upon the mi&s;erable and au&s;tere life they led, I knew not what Judgment to make of them.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that many &s;ay, that they do not exerci&s;e the&s;e &s;trange au&s;terities but in the hopes they entertain of becoming <HI>Rajas</HI> in their rena&s;cence, or of returning again in a more happy life. But, as I have often told them to their Faces, how is't po&s;&s;ible for any Man to re&s;olve upon &s;uch a mi&s;erable life from the hope of another, that is to be no longer, and hath al&s;o, in the up&s;hot, but very little happine&s;s in it, though one &s;hould return a <HI>Raja,</HI> and even a <HI>Je&s;&s;eingue</HI> or a <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eingue,</HI> which are the two mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant <HI>Rajas</HI> of the <HI>Indies?</HI> There mu&s;t needs, &s;aid I, lie &s;omething el&s;e under it, which you have no mind to di&s;cover to us, or you mu&s;t be arrant Fools.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e I have been &s;peaking of, there are &s;uch that are believed to be true Saints, illuminated and perfect <HI>Jauguis,</HI> entirely united to God. The&s;e are people that have altogether abandon'd the World, and &s;eque&s;ter'd them&s;elves into &s;ome very re|mote corner or Garden, like Eremites, without ever coming to Town. If you carry them any meat, they receive it; if they do not, 'tis believed that they can live without it, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the &s;ole favour of God in perpetual fa&s;ting, prayer, and profound meditations: For they &s;ink them&s;elves &s;o deep into <HI>the&s;e</HI> raptures, that they &s;pend many hours together in being in&s;en&s;ible, and beholding in that time, as they give out, God him&s;elf, like a very bright and ineffable Light, with an unexpre&s;&s;ible joy and &s;atisfacti|on, attended with an entire contempt and for&s;aking of the World: For thus much one of them, that pretended he could enter into this rapture when he plea&s;ed, and had been often in it, told me; and others that are about them, affirm the thing with &s;o much &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that they &s;eem to believe in earne&s;t, as if there were no impo&s;ture in it.
<PB N="103" REF="386">
God alone knows whether there be any truth in it, and whether in this &s;olitude and fa&s;ting the imagination debilitated, may not &s;uffer it &s;elf to be carried away into the&s;e illu&s;ions: Or whether they be not of that kind of natural Raptures, into which <HI>Cardan</HI> &s;aid he fell when he li&s;ted; and this the rather, becau&s;e I &s;ee, there is u&s;ed &s;ome Art in what they do, fora&s;much as they pre&s;cribe to them&s;elves certain Rules, by little and little to bind up their Sen&s;es: For they &s;ay, for Example, that after they have fa&s;ted many days, u&s;ing nothing but Bread and Water, 'tis requi&s;ite fir&s;t to keep them&s;elves alone retired from all company, directing the Eyes &s;teadily towards Heaven for a while, then gently ca&s;ting them down again, and then fixing them both &s;o as to look at one and the &s;ame time upon the tip of their No&s;e equally, and as much on one &s;ide as the other (which is trouble&s;ome enough) and remaining firm and intent in that po&s;ture, until &s;uch a Light do come. Whatever the matter be, I know, that the&s;e Raptures, and the&s;e ways of falling into them, make the great My&s;tery of the Cabala of <HI>Jauguis,</HI> as the <HI>Soufys</HI> do al&s;o. I call it <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> becau&s;e they keep it very &s;ecret among&s;t them; and if it had not been for this <HI>Pendet</HI> or Indian Doctor, to whom <HI>Danechmend-kan</HI> gave a Pen&s;ion, and who dur&s;t hide nothing from him; and if al&s;o <HI>Danechmend-kan</HI> had not known the My&s;teries of the <HI>Cabala</HI> of the <HI>Soufys,</HI> I &s;hould not have di&s;cover'd &s;o much of it. I know be&s;ides, that as for the extremity of Poverty, of Fa&s;tings and Au&s;teri|ties, that al&s;o can do much to it. We mu&s;t not think (or I am much deceived) that any of our Religious Fryars or Eremites go in this point beyond tho&s;e Men, nor gene|rally beyond all the A&s;iatick Monks; witne&s;s the Life and Fa&s;tings of the <HI>Armenians; Copththes, Greeks, Ne&s;torians, Jacobites,</HI> and <HI>Maronites.</HI> We mu&s;t rather avow, that we are but Novices, when compared with tho&s;e Religious Men: But then we mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge, according to what I have experimented, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies,</HI> that they can much more ea&s;ily bear hunger than we can in our colder Climates.</P>
<P>There are others very differing from tho&s;e, but very &s;trange Men likewi&s;e; they are almo&s;t perpetually travelling up and down, they deride all, take care of nothing, Men that brag of &s;ecrets, and who, as the people &s;ay, know no le&s;s than to make Gold, and &s;o admirably to pepare <HI>Mercury,</HI> that a grain or two of it taken every morning re|&s;toreth the body to perfect health, and &s;o &s;trengthens the Stomach, that it feeds gree|dily and dige&s;ts with ea&s;e. This is not all: When two of the&s;e <HI>Jauguis,</HI> that are emi|nent, do meet, and you &s;tir them up in the point and power of their knowledge or <HI>Jaugui&s;me,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee them do &s;uch tricks out of &s;pight to one onother, that I know not whether <HI>Simon Magus</HI> could have out-done them. For they divine what one think|eth, make the Branch of a Tree blo&s;&s;ome and bear fruit in le&s;s than an hour, hatch Eggs in their bo&s;ome in le&s;s than half a quarter of an hour, and bring forth &s;uch Birds as you demand, which they make fly about the Chamber, and many &s;uch other prodigies. I mean, if what is &s;aid of them be true; for I remember, that one day my <HI>Agah</HI> &s;ent for one of the&s;e famous Diviners, and when he was come, agreed with him to give him the next day 300 Roupies, which is about 150 Crowns, if he &s;hould tell him, as he &s;aid he would, his pre&s;ent thought, which he was to write before him upon a paper: As al&s;o, that I my &s;elf made a bargain with the &s;ame, to give him 25 Roupies, if he &s;hould divine mine; but the Prophet failed us, as al&s;o did at another time one of tho&s;e pretended producers of Birds, to whom I had al&s;o promi&s;ed 20 Roupies. I am &s;till to be under|&s;tood, if it be true what is &s;aid of them. For, as for me, I am with all my curio&s;ity none of tho&s;e happy Men, that are pre&s;ent at, and &s;ee tho&s;e great feats; and if I &s;hould chance to &s;ee any of &s;uch things as are thought &s;trange, I am always con&s;idering and &s;eeking, whether the thing may not be done by &s;ome Juggle, Art, or Trick of Leger|demain: and I am &s;ometimes even &s;o unhappy, or, if you will, &s;o fortunate, as to find out the cheat, as I did him, that made a Cup run, to di&s;cover who it was, that had &s;tolen money from my <HI>Agah.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are &s;ome in many places, that are quite of another way than all tho&s;e I have di&s;cour&s;ed of. Their Life and their Devotion is more meek and more poli&s;ht; they go over the &s;treets bare-foot and bare-headed, girt about with a Scarfe hanging down to their Knees, and having a white Sheet which pa&s;&s;eth under their right Arm, and comes out over their left Shoulder like a Cloak, without other Cloaths under it. They are always very clean and neat in all things, and commonly go two and two together with great mode&s;ty, holding in their Hand a &s;mall Earthen Travet with two handles, very neat. They do not go go&s;&s;iping from Shop to Shop, as many of the other <HI>Fakires</HI> do. They go freely every where into the Hou&s;es of the Gentiles, where they are wel|come,
<PB N="104" REF="387">
and much made of; they being e&s;teem'd a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Hou&s;e. They are by no means to be accu&s;ed of any thing, though it be well enough known, what in &s;uch vi|&s;its among the Women pa&s;&s;eth. But 'tis the cu&s;tom, they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of being Saints for all that, and any Hou&s;e thinks it &s;elf honour'd with their vi&s;it. But it is not only there &s;o; many other places there be in the World, where things are not &s;o &s;trictly look'd to. But that which I find mo&s;t ridiculous in tho&s;e people is, That they are im|pertinent enough, to compare them&s;elves with our Religious Men, they meet with in the <HI>Indies.</HI> I have often taken plea&s;ure to catch them, u&s;ing much ceremony with them, and giving them great re&s;pect; but I &s;oon heard them &s;ay to one another, This <HI>Fran|guis</HI> knows who we are, he hath been a great while in the <HI>Indies,</HI> he knows that we are the <HI>Padrys</HI> of the <HI>Indians.</HI> A fine compari&s;on, &s;aid I within my &s;elf, made by an impertinent and idolatrous rabble of Men!</P>
<P>But we &s;tay too long upon the&s;e Heathen-Beggers: Let us go on to their <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Sciences:</HI> you may afterwards judge, whether mo&s;t of what I am going to &s;ay of it, may be put, as I think it may, in the number of Extravagancies.</P>
<P>Do not wonder, if, though I know not the <HI>Han&s;crit,</HI> the language of the Learn'd (of which &s;omewhat may be &s;aid hereafter, and which is perhaps the &s;ame with that of the old <HI>Brahmans)</HI> do notwith&s;tanding tell you many things taken out of Books written in that Tongue. For you mu&s;t know, that my <HI>Agah Danechmend-kan,</HI> partly upon my &s;olicitation, partly out of his own curio&s;ity, took into his &s;ervice one of the famou&s;e&s;t <HI>Pendets</HI> that was in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that formerly had had a Pen&s;ion of <HI>Dara,</HI> the Elde&s;t Son of King <HI>Chah-jehan;</HI> and that this <HI>Pendet,</HI> be&s;ides that he drew to our Hou&s;e all the mo&s;t Learned <HI>Pendets,</HI> was for three years con&s;tantly of my conver&s;ation. When I was weary of explaining to my <HI>Agah</HI> tho&s;e late di&s;coveries of <HI>Harvey</HI> and <HI>Pecquet</HI> in <HI>Anatomy,</HI> and of di&s;cour&s;ing with him of the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> and <HI>De&s;-cartes,</HI> which I tran&s;lated to him into <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> (for that was my chief employment for five or &s;ix years) that <HI>Pendet</HI> was our refuge, and then he was obliged to di&s;cour&s;e, and to re|late unto us his &s;tories, which he deliver'd &s;eriou&s;ly and without ever &s;miling. 'Tis true, that at la&s;t we were &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted with his tales and uncouth rea&s;onings, that we &s;carce had patience left to hear them.</P>
<P>They &s;ay then, that God, whom they call <HI>Achar,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Immoveable or Im|mutable, hath &s;ent them four Books, which they call <HI>Beths,</HI> a word &s;ignifying <HI>Science,</HI> becau&s;e they pretend that in the&s;e Books all Sciences are comprehended. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Books is call'd <HI>Athen-habed,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Zager-bed,</HI> the third <HI>Rek-bed,</HI> the fourth <HI>Sama-bed.</HI> Conform to the doctrine of the&s;e Books, this people ought to be di&s;tingui&s;h't, as really they are, into four Tribes: The fir&s;t is of <HI>Brachmans,</HI> Men of the Law; the &s;e|cond of <HI>Quetterys,</HI> Men of Arms; the third, Men of <HI>Be&s;cue</HI> or <HI>Trafick,</HI> commonly called <HI>Eanians;</HI> and the fourth, Men of <HI>Seydra,</HI> that is, Handy-crafts Men and Labourers. And the&s;e are &s;o di&s;criminated, that tho&s;e of one Tribe cannot marry into another, that is, a <HI>Brahman</HI> cannot marry with a Woman <HI>Quettery,</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>They all agree in one Doctrine, which is that of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> concerning the <HI>Metem|p&s;ycho&s;is</HI> or Tran&s;migration of Souls, and in this, that they mu&s;t not kill or eat of any Animal. However there are &s;ome of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Tribe that may eat of them, provided it be neither <HI>Cows</HI> nor <HI>Peacocks</HI>-fle&s;h, they all having a great veneration for the&s;e two creatures, e&s;pecially the <HI>Cow,</HI> becau&s;e they fancy I know not what River lying between this Life and that to come, which they are to pa&s;s by holding them&s;elves fa&s;t on a Cows|tail. Po&s;&s;ibly their ancient Legi&s;lators had &s;een tho&s;e Shepherds of <HI>Egypt,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Nile,</HI> by holding with their left-hand the Tail of an Oxe, and in their right-hand a Stick to guide him with; or rather they have imprinted in them this re&s;pect for Cows, becau&s;e they draw from them Milk and Butter, which is a great part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and becau&s;e al&s;o they are &s;o &s;erviceable for the Plough, and con&s;equently for the Life of Man; and that the rather becau&s;e it is not &s;o in the <HI>Indies</HI> as in our Parts, for maintaining &s;o great a number of Cattle as we do: if but half as many of them &s;hould be killed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as there are in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> the Country will quickly be de&s;titute of them, and the Land remain Untilled. The heat is there &s;o violent for eight months of the year, that all is dry, and that Oxen and Cows are often &s;tarved, or dye of eating tra&s;h in the Fields like Hogs. And 'tis upon the account of the &s;carcity of Cat|tle, that in the time of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> the <HI>Brahmans</HI> obtain'd an Edict, that no Cattle &s;hould be kill'd for a certain number of years, and that of late they pre&s;ented a Petition to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and offered him a con&s;iderable &s;um, if he would make the like Pro|hibition.

They remon&s;trated, that for 50 or 60 years pa&s;t much Land had remained Unploughed, becau&s;e the Oxen and Cows were become too &s;carce and too dear. It may be al&s;o, that the&s;e Law-givers con&s;idered, that Cows and Ox-fle&s;h in the <HI>Indies</HI> is not very &s;avoury, nor whole&s;ome, unle&s;s it be for a little time in Winter, during the cooler &s;ea&s;on: Or la&s;tly, that they would take the People off from mutual cruelty, (to which they were too much inclined) by obliging them, as by a Maxime of Religion, to exerci&s;e humanity to the very Bea&s;ts, and by making them believe, that killing or eat|ing an Animal, it might happen that they did kill or eat one of their Grand-&s;ires; which would be an horrid crime.</P>
<P>According to the Doctrine of the&s;e <HI>Beths,</HI> they are obliged to &s;ay their Prayers at lea&s;t thrice every day, in the morning, at noon, and at night, with their face turned to the Ea&s;t. They are al&s;o bound to wa&s;h their whole body thrice, or at lea&s;t before they eat; and they believe, that 'tis more meritorious to wa&s;h them&s;elves in running water then in any other. And it may be, that the Legi&s;lators in this point al&s;o have had a re&s;pect to what is proper and convenient for this Countrey, where nothing is more de|&s;irable then wa&s;hing and bathing. And they find it trouble&s;ome enough to ob&s;erve this Law, when they are in cold Countries: I have &s;een &s;ome of them that were like to die, becau&s;e they would <HI>there</HI> al&s;o ob&s;erve their Law of wa&s;hing their Body by plunging them&s;elves into Rivers or Ponds, when they found any near; or by throwing whole buckets of water over their heads, when they were remote from them. When I told them upon occa&s;ion, that in cold Countries it would not be po&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve that Law of theirs in Winter (which was a &s;ign of its being a meer human invention) they gave this plea&s;ant an&s;wer: That they pretended not their Law was univer&s;al; that God had only made it for them, and it was therefore that they could not receive a Stranger into their Religion: that they thought not our Religion was therefore fal&s;e, but that it might be it was good for us, and that God might have appointed &s;everal differing ways to go to Heaven; but they will not hear that our Religion &s;hould be the general Re|ligion for the whole earth, and theirs a fable and pure device.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ame Books do teach them, that God having determined to create the World, would not execute it immediately, but made fir&s;t three Perfect Beings: the fir&s;t was <HI>Brahma,</HI> which &s;ignifieth Penetrating into all things; the &s;econd <HI>Be&s;chen,</HI> that is Exi&s;t|ing in all things; and the third <HI>Mehahden,</HI> that is, great Lord. That by the means of <HI>Brahma</HI> he created the World, by the means of <HI>Be&s;chen</HI> he pre&s;erveth it, and by the means of <HI>Mehahden</HI> he will de&s;troy it. That it is <HI>Brahma,</HI> who by the command of God did publi&s;h the four <HI>Beths,</HI> and that therefore he is in &s;ome of their Churches repre&s;ented with four Heads.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e three <HI>Beings,</HI> I have &s;een &s;ome <HI>European</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries that were of opinion, that the&s;e Gentils had &s;ome <HI>Idea</HI> of the My&s;tery of the <HI>Trinity;</HI> and &s;aid, it was expre&s;|ly contained in their Books that there are three Per&s;ons, and one only God. For my part, I have made the <HI>Pendets</HI> &s;ufficiently di&s;cour&s;e upon this point; but they declare them&s;elves &s;o poorly, that I could not clearly under&s;tand their &s;en&s;e. I have even heard &s;ome of them, who &s;aid, that the&s;e are three Creatures very perfect, which they called <HI>De&uuml;tas,</HI> y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> without explaining well what they under&s;tood by this word <HI>De&uuml;tas;</HI> as our antient Idolaters never explained what they meant by the&s;e words <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Numina,</HI> which is (I think) the &s;ame with <HI>De&uuml;ta</HI> among the Indians. 'Tis true, that I have &s;poken with others of the mo&s;t knowing among&s;t them, who &s;aid, that the&s;e three Beings were indeed nothing but one and the &s;ame God, con&s;idered three manner of way, <HI>viz.</HI> as he is the Producer, Con&s;ervator, and De&s;troyer of things; but they &s;aid no|thing of three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons in one onely Deity.</P>
<P>Moreover I have &s;een the Reverend Father <HI>Roa,</HI> a German Je&s;uit and Mi&s;&s;ionary at <HI>Agra,</HI> who being well ver&s;ed in their <HI>Han&s;crit,</HI> maintained that their Books did not onely import, there was one God in three Per&s;ons, but that even the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Per&s;on of their Trinity was incarnated nine times. And that I may not be thought to a&s;cribe to my &s;elf the writings of others, I &s;hall relate unto you word for word, what a certain <HI>Carmelite</HI> of <HI>Chiras</HI> hath lighted upon, which he related when the above-mentioned Fa|that <HI>Roa</HI> pa&s;&s;ed that way to come back to <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Gentils</HI> (&s;aith he) do hold, that the &s;econd Per&s;on of the Trinity was incarnated nine times, and <HI>that</HI> becau&s;e of divers nece&s;&s;ities of the World, from which he hath delivered it: But the <HI>eighth</HI> Incarnation is the mo&s;t notable; for they hold, that the World being in&s;laved under the power of Giants, it was redeemed by the &s;econd Per&s;on, incarnated and born of a Virgin at

midnight, the Angels &s;inging in the Air, and the Heavens pouring down a &s;hower of flowers all that night. This &s;avours much of Chri&s;tianity: But then there follows a Fable again, which is, That this God incamate killed fir&s;t of all a Giant that flew in the Air, and was &s;o big as to ob&s;cure the Sun, and by his fall to make the Earth to &s;hake, and that by his great weight he &s;unk as deep as Hell&punc; that this God incarnate being wounded in the &s;ide, in the fir&s;t conflict with this Giant, fell, but by his fall put his Enemies to flight; that after he had rai&s;ed him&s;elf again, and redeemed the World, he a&s;cended into Heaven; and that by rea&s;on of his wound, he is commonly called the <HI>Wounded in his Side.</HI> In the <HI>tenth</HI> Incarnation, which &s;hall then be, when according to our &s;upputation Antichri&s;t &s;hall come, the World &s;hall be delivered from the &s;lavery of the Mahumetans: But this is only a vulgar Tradition, which is not found in their Books.</P>
<P>They &s;ay al&s;o, that the <HI>Third</HI> Per&s;on of the Trinity hath manife&s;ted him&s;elf to the World; concerning which they relate, That the Daughter of a certain King, being fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o be married, and asked by her Father, whom &s;he would marry, an&s;wered, that &s;he would not be united but to a Divine Per&s;on; and that at the &s;ame time, the Third Per|&s;on of the Trinity appeared to the King in the form of Fire; that that King forthwith gave notice of it to his Daughter, who pre&s;ently con&s;ented to the Marriage; That this Per&s;on of the Trinity, though altogether in a firy appearance, was called before the King's Council, and &s;eeing that the Coun&s;ellors oppo&s;ed this Marriage, took hold of their Beards and burned them, together with the whole Royal Palace, and then married the Daughter. Ridiculous!</P>
<P>They add, that the fir&s;t Incarnation of the &s;econd Per&s;on, was in the nature of a <HI>Lion;</HI> the &s;econd, in that of a <HI>Swine;</HI> the third, in that of a <HI>Tortoi&s;e;</HI> the fourth, in that of a <HI>Serpent;</HI> the fifth in that of a Brahma <HI>She-Dwarf,</HI> onely a foot and a half high; the &s;ixth, in that of a Mon&s;ter, a <HI>Man-Lion;</HI> the &s;eventh, in that of a <HI>Dragon;</HI> the eighth, as hath been &s;aid already; the ninth, in an <HI>Ape;</HI> the tenth, in that of a great <HI>Cavalier.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning this I &s;hall acquaint you, that I doubt not but that the Reverend Father <HI>Roa,</HI> hath taken all he &s;aith of this matter out of the Books of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that is the main ground of their <HI>Mythology.</HI> I had written many things of it at large in my Papers, and had al&s;o taken the Figures of their Gods or Idols, which I had &s;een in their Temples, having al&s;o got of them the Characters of their Language <HI>Han&s;crit;</HI> but find|ing at my return all tho&s;e things, or at lea&s;t the be&s;t part of it Printed in the <HI>China Illu&s;t|rata</HI> of Father <HI>Kircher,</HI> who had obtained it at <HI>Rome</HI> from the &s;ame Father <HI>Roa;</HI> I &s;hall content my &s;elf to have named the Book to you. 'Tis true, that the word <HI>Incarnation,</HI> which the Reverend Father u&s;eth, was new to me, having never &s;een it &s;o expre&s;ly u&s;ed; I had only heard &s;ome <HI>Pendets</HI> thus explaining the thing, <HI>viz.</HI> That God had formerly appeared in tho&s;e Figures when he did all tho&s;e wonders they relate. Others explained it to me after this manner, to wit, That it was the Soul of certain Great Men, &s;uch as we might call <HI>Hero</HI>'s, that had pa&s;&s;ed into the&s;e Bodies, and that the&s;e Hero's were thus become <HI>De&uuml;tas,</HI> or to &s;peak in the phra&s;e of our old Idolaters, &s;ome powerful and con&s;iderable Divinities, <HI>Numens, Genio's, Demons, Spirits;</HI> for I &s;ee not that this word <HI>De&uuml;ta</HI> can &s;ignifie any other thing: But this &s;econd Explication of the <HI>Pendets,</HI> cometh in effect to the fir&s;t, for as much as mo&s;t of them believe, that our Souls are Portions of God.</P>
<P>Others there were that gave me a much &s;ublimer Explication, &s;aying, That all tho&s;e <HI>Incarnations</HI> or Apparitions, which their Books &s;peak of are not to be under&s;tood accord|ing to the Letter, but My&s;tically, fora&s;much as thereby are explained the &s;everal Attributes of God. Some there were, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t learned, acknowledging to me can|didly, that there was nothing more fabulous then tho&s;e <HI>Incarnations,</HI> and that they were only the Inventions of Legi&s;lators, to retain People in &s;ome Religion: And though this were &s;o, if there were nothing el&s;e but this, (which is common to them all) that our Souls were Portions of the Deity, it were to be exploded in &s;ound Phylo&s;ophy, without making any My&s;teries in Religion of it, &s;eeing that in re&s;pect of our Souls we &s;hould be <HI>God,</HI> and that in effect it &s;hould be our &s;elves that had impo&s;ed upon us a Religious Wor&s;hip, Metemp&s;ycho&s;es, Paradice and Hell, which would be ridiculous.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add a few words, to declare that I am not le&s;s obliged to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hen|ry Lor,</HI> and to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Abraham Roger,</HI> then to the Reverend Fathers <HI>Kircher</HI> and <HI>Roa.</HI> I had compil'd an hundred things relating to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which I found in the Books of tho&s;e Gentlemen, and which would have been a great trouble to me to range them as
<PB N="107" REF="388">
they have done. I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf to &s;ay &s;omething in General to you of their <HI>Studies</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> not indeed in that good order which po&s;&s;ibly you might expect, but ju&s;t as I have learnt it, and as 'tis probably found in their Books; I mean by fragments, and without coherence.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Benares,</HI> which is &s;eated upon the <HI>Ganges</HI> in a very fine and rich Coun|try and place, is the General School, and as 'twere the <HI>Athens</HI> of the Gentry of the Indies; where the <HI>Brachmans</HI> and the <HI>Religious</HI> (tho&s;e that addict them&s;elves to &s;tudy) come together. They have no Colledges nor <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> ordered as with us, me thinks, 'tis more after the way of the School of the Antients; the Ma&s;ters being di&s;per&s;ed over the Town in their Hou&s;es, and e&s;pecially in the Gardens of the Suburbs, where the great Merchants do &s;uffer them. Of the&s;e Ma&s;ters &s;ome have four Di&s;ciples; o|thers &s;ix or &s;even; and the mo&s;t famous, twelve or fifteen at mo&s;t, who &s;pend ten or a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">zen years with them. All this &s;tudy goeth on very cooly, becau&s;e mo&s;t In|dians are of a &s;low and lazy humour, to which the heat and diet of the Country contri|butes much; and becau&s;e they are not animated to indu&s;try as we, by that great emu|lation, and by the great hopes we have of coming thereby to great preferment. They &s;tudy lea&s;urely, and without much tormenting them&s;elves; eating their <HI>Kichery</HI> or mix|ture of Legums, which the rich Merchants cau&s;e to be dre&s;&s;ed for them.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t &s;tudy is of the <HI>Han&s;crit,</HI> which is a Language altogether different from the common <HI>Indian,</HI> and not known but by the <HI>Pendets.</HI> And this is that Tongue, of which Father <HI>Kircher</HI> hath publi&s;ht the Alphabet received from Father <HI>Roa.</HI> It is called <HI>Han&s;crit,</HI> that is, a pure Language; and becau&s;e they believe this is to be the Tongue, in which God, by the means of <HI>Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">a,</HI> gave them the four <HI>Beths,</HI> which they e&s;teem <HI>Sacred</HI> Books, they call it an Holy and Divine Language. They pretend al&s;o, that it is as antient as <HI>Brahma,</HI> who&s;e Age they do not reckon but by <HI>Lecques,</HI> or hundred thou&s;ands of years. But I would gladly have a warrant for &s;uch an extraordinary Antiquity. However, it cannot be denied that 'tis very old, in regard that the Books of their Re|ligion, which certainly is very antient, are written in this Tongue, and be&s;ides that, it hath it's Authors in Philo&s;ophy and Phy&s;ick in Ver&s;es, and &s;ome other Poems, and ma|ny other Books, of which I have &s;een a great Hall quite full in <HI>Benares.</HI></P>
<P>After they have learned the <HI>Han&s;crit</HI> (which is very difficult to them, becau&s;e they have no Grammar worth any thing) they commonly apply them&s;elves to read the <HI>Pu|rane,</HI> which is as it were the interpretation and &s;um of the <HI>Beths,</HI> which are very large, at lea&s;t if tho&s;e be they which were &s;hewed me at <HI>Benares:</HI> and be&s;ides they are &s;o very rare, that my <HI>Agah</HI> could never find them to be &s;old, what indu&s;try &s;oever he u&s;ed in it. And they keep them very &s;ecret, for fear lea&s;t the Mahumetans &s;hould lay their hands on them and burn them, as they have already done &s;everal times.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Purane</HI> &s;ome fall upon Philo&s;ophy, wherein certainly they go not far. I have already intimated, that they are of a &s;low and lazy temper, and are not excited by the hopes to obtain &s;ome good place by their &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Among their Philo&s;ophers there have principally been &s;ix very famous, who make &s;o many different Sects; which cau&s;eth al&s;o a difference and an emulation among the <HI>Pendets</HI> or Doctors: For they know, that &s;uch an one is of this Sect, another of ano|ther, and every one of them pretends his Doctrine to be better than that of others, and more conform to the <HI>Beths.</HI> There is indeed another, a &s;eventh Sect, which is called <HI>Baut&eacute;</HI> whence do proceed twelve other different Sects; but this is not &s;o common as the others, the Votaries of it being hated and de&s;pi&s;ed as a company of irreligious and athei&s;tical people, nor do they live like the re&s;t.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Books &s;peak of the <HI>fir&s;t principles</HI> of things, but very differently. Some &s;ay, that all is compo&s;ed of little Bodies that are indivi&s;ible, not by rea&s;on of their &s;olidity, hardne&s;s, and re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;malne&s;s; adding divers things which approach to the opinions of <HI>Democritus</HI> and <HI>Epicurus,</HI> but with &s;o much confu&s;ion that one knows not where to fa&s;ten, all &s;eeming like a rope of &s;and: which yet may be as much or more the fault of the <HI>Pendets,</HI> which &s;eem to me very ignorant, then of the Authors.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that all is made up of <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>form;</HI> but not one of them explains him&s;elf clearly about the <HI>matter,</HI> and le&s;s about the <HI>form.</HI> Yet &s;o much I have found, that they under&s;tand them not at all as they are wont to be explained in our Schools, by educing the Form out of the power of the Matter: For they always alledge Exam|ples of things Artificial, and among them that of a Ve&s;&s;el of &s;oft Clay, which a Pot|ter turns and &s;hapes divers ways.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="389">
Others hold, that all is compo&s;ed of <HI>four Elements</HI> and a <HI>nothing;</HI> but they do not at all explain them&s;elves concerning Mixtion and Tran&s;mutation. And as for their <HI>nothing,</HI> which comes near to our <HI>privation,</HI> they admit I know not how many &s;orts of them, which (I believe) they under&s;tand not at all, nor are able to make out to others.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome, that maintain <HI>light</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> to be the fir&s;t Principles, and &s;ay a thou&s;and impertinent and confu&s;ed things upon it, making long-winded di&s;cour|&s;es, which &s;avour nothing at all of Philo&s;ophy, but are like the talk of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Others there are that admit <HI>privation</HI> for the Principle, or rather <HI>privations,</HI> which they di&s;tingui&s;h from <HI>nothing,</HI> and of which they make long enumerations, &s;o u&s;ele&s;s and little philo&s;ophical, that I can &s;carce imagine them to be in their Books, or that their Authors could have entertained them&s;elves with &s;uch uncouth things.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;ome of them do pretend that all is compo&s;ed of <HI>accidents;</HI> of which al&s;o they make odd, long, and tedious enumerations, and &s;uch as favour only &s;ome Petti|fogger, that can amu&s;e the common People.</P>
<P>Touching the&s;e Principles in general, they all agree that they are <HI>eternal;</HI> our pro|duction out of nothing not having come (it &s;eems) into their thoughts, as it hath nei|ther to many others of the antient Philo&s;ophers: Yet they &s;ay, that there is one of them that hath touched &s;omething of it.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> they have many little Books that are rather collections of <HI>receits</HI> then any thing el&s;e; the mo&s;t antient and chief wherefore is in Ver&s;e. I &s;hall here tell you. that their <HI>practice</HI> is &s;ufficiently different from ours, and that they ground them&s;elves upon the&s;e Principles: <HI>That</HI> one who is &s;ick of a Feaver, needs no great nouri&s;hment: <HI>That</HI> the main Remedy of &s;ickne&s;&s;es, is Ab&s;tinence: <HI>That</HI> nothing is wor&s;e for a &s;ick Bo|dy then Fle&s;h-broth, nor which corrupts &s;ooner in the Stomach of a feveri&s;h Patient: <HI>That</HI> no Blood is to be let but in great and evident nece&s;&s;ity, as when you apprehend &s;ome tran&s;lation into the Brain, or finde &s;ome con&s;iderable part, as the Che&s;t, Liver, Kidneys, enflamed.</P>
<P>Whether this Practice be better then ours, I leave to Phy&s;itians to decide; but I &s;ee that 'tis &s;ucce&s;sful among <HI>them.</HI> The &s;ame practice is not peculiar to the Phy&s;itians of the Gentils, but the Mogolian and Mahumetan Doctors, that follow <HI>Avicen</HI> and <HI>Aver|roes,</HI> do al&s;o very &s;trictly ob&s;erve it, e&s;pecially as to Meat-broths. 'Tis true that the <HI>Mogols</HI> are &s;omewhat more prodigal of their Blood then the <HI>Gentils,</HI> for in tho&s;e &s;ickne&s;|&s;es wherein they fear tho&s;e accidents lately &s;pecified, they commonly blood once or twice: but the&s;e are none of tho&s;e petty vene&s;ections of the new invention of <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> but they are of tho&s;e plentiful ones u&s;ed by the Antients, of 18. or 20. ounces of Blood, which often come to a &s;wounding, and frequently choak the Di&s;ea&s;e in the ve|ry beginning, as <HI>Galen</HI> &s;aith, and as I have often experimented.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Anatomy,</HI> I may &s;afely &s;ay, that the Gentils under&s;tand nothing at all of it, and they can &s;peak nothing as to that &s;ubject but what is impertinent. Nor is it a wonder they are &s;o ignorant in it, &s;ince they never open any Body of Man or Bea&s;t: they do &s;o much abhor it, that when I opened &s;ome living Kids and Sheep before my <HI>Agah,</HI> to make him under&s;tand the Circulation of the Blood, and to &s;hew him the <HI>Pecquetian</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, through which the Chyle at la&s;t comes into one of the ventricles of the Heart, they trembled for fear and ran away. Yet notwith&s;tanding they affirm, that there are five thou&s;and Veins in Man, neither more nor lo&s;s, as if they had well count|ed them all.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> they have their Tables, according to which they fore&s;ee the <HI>Eclip&s;es;</HI> and though they do it not with that exactne&s;s as our European A&s;tronomers, yet they come pretty near. Mean time they di&s;cour&s;e of the Eclip&s;e of the Moon, as they do upon that of the Sun, believing that it is the <HI>Rah,</HI> that black Villain, and mi&s;|chievous <HI>Denta,</HI> who at that time &s;eizeth on the Moon and blackens her. They hold al&s;o, <HI>that</HI> the Moon is an hundred thou&s;and <HI>ko&s;&s;es,</HI> that is, above fifty thou&s;and Leagues above the Sun: <HI>that</HI> &s;he is lucid of her &s;elf; and <HI>that</HI> 'tis &s;he, from whom we receive a certain Vital Water, which gathereth and di&s;po&s;eth it &s;elf in the Brain, de&s;cending thence as from a &s;ource into all the members for their functions. Be&s;ides this, they are of opinion, that the Sun and Moon, and generally all Stars are <HI>De&uuml;tas;</HI> that 'tis night when the Sun is behind the <HI>Someire,</HI> that imaginary Mountain, which they place in the mid&s;t of the Earth, and make I know not how many thou&s;and Leagues high, and to which they give the &s;hape of an inverted Sugar-loaf; &s;o that 'tis not day with them, but when the Sun gets out from behinde this Mountain.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="389">
In <HI>Geography</HI> they have &s;ped no better. They believe the Earth to be flat and tri|angular, and that it hath &s;even &s;tories, all differing in beauty, perfection, and inhabi|tants; each of which is encompa&s;&s;ed, they &s;ay, by its Sea; that of the&s;e Seas one is of Milk, another of Sugar, the third of Butter, the fourth of Wine, and &s;o forth: &s;o that after one Earth there comes a Sea, and after, Sea an Earth; and &s;o on unto &s;even, begin|ning from <HI>Someire,</HI> which is in the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;tories: that the fir&s;t &s;tory, which is at the foot of <HI>Someire,</HI> hath <HI>De&uuml;tas</HI> for its inhabitants, which are very perfect; that the &s;econd contains likewi&s;e <HI>De&uuml;tas,</HI> but le&s;s perfect; and &s;o the re&s;t, &s;till le&s;&s;ening the perfection unto the &s;eventh, which they &s;ay is ours, that is, of men far le&s;s perfect then all the <HI>De&uuml;tas;</HI> and la&s;tly, that this whole Ma&s;s is &s;u&s;tained upon the heads of divers Elephants, which when they &s;tir, cau&s;e an Earthquake.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;trange impertinences, which I have had the patience to relate, have often made me think, that if <HI>they</HI> be tho&s;e famous Sciences of the antient <HI>Brahmans</HI> of the Indies, very many have been deceived in the great opinion they entertained of them. For my part, I can hardly believe it, but that I find the Religion of the Indians to be from immemorial times; that 'tis written in the Language <HI>Han&s;crit,</HI> which cannot be but very antient, &s;ince its beginning is unknown, and 'tis a <HI>dead</HI> Language, not under&s;tood but by the Learned; that all their Books are only written in that Tongue: All which are as many marks of a very great Antiquity. Let us now add a few words about the <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of their <HI>Idols.</HI></P>
<P>When I de&s;cended along the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Banares,</HI> that famous School of all the Indian Gentility, I went to &s;ee the chief of the <HI>Pendets,</HI> who hath there his ordinary re&s;idence. This is a <HI>Fakire,</HI> or Religious Monk, &s;o renowned for his knowledge, that <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> partly for his Science, partly to plea&s;e the <HI>Rajas,</HI> gave him a Pen&s;ion of 2000 Roupies, that is, about 1000 Crowns. This was a big and proper Man, goodly to look on; who for all his Cloaths had nothing but a white &s;ilken Scarf, tied about his wa&s;te, and hanging down to his mid-leg, with another red Scarf about his &s;houlders like a little Cloak. I had often &s;een him at <HI>Dehli</HI> in this po&s;ture before the King, in the A&s;&s;embly of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and marching upon the Streets, &s;ometimes on foot, &s;ometimes in a <HI>Palekey.</HI> I had al&s;o frequently &s;een and many times conver&s;ed with him, when for a whole year together he con&s;tantly came to our conference before my <HI>Agah,</HI> whom he courted, that he might procure him again that Pen&s;ion which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> (being come to the Crown) had taken from him, that he might appear a great Mu&s;ulman. In the vi&s;it I made him at <HI>Banares,</HI> he was exceedingly courteous to me, and even gave me a Collation in the Library of his Uni|ver&s;ity, attended with &s;ix of the mo&s;t famous <HI>Pendets</HI> of the Town. When I found my &s;elf in &s;o good Company, I prayed them all to tell me their &s;en&s;e about the Adora|tion of their Idols; intimating to them, that I was leaving that Indies, extreamly &s;candalized upon that &s;core; and reproaching them, that that wor&s;hip was a thing again&s;t all rea&s;on, and altogether unworthy &s;uch Scholars and Philo&s;ophers as they were. Whereupon I received this An&s;wer.</P>
<P>We have indeed <HI>(&s;aid they)</HI> in our Deuras or Temples, &s;tore of divers Statues, as tho&s;e of <HI>Braham, Mehaden, Genich</HI> and <HI>Gavani,</HI> who are &s;ome of the chief and the mo&s;t perfect <HI>De&uuml;tas:</HI> and we have al&s;o many others of le&s;s perfection, to whom we pay great honour, pro|&s;trating our &s;elves before them, and pre&s;enting them Flowers, Rice, &s;cented Oyls, Saffron and &s;uch other things with much Ceremony, but we do not believe the&s;e Statues to be <HI>Brahma</HI> or <HI>Bechen,</HI> &amp;c. them&s;elves, but only their Images and Repre&s;entations, and we do not give them that honour, but upon the account of what they repre&s;ent. They are in our Temples, becau&s;e 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for praying well, to have &s;omething before our eyes that may fix the mind; and when we pray, it is not the Statue we pray to, but he that is repre&s;ented by it. For the re&s;t, we acknowledge that 'tis God that is ab&s;olute, and the only Omnipotent Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This is, without adding or &s;ubtracting any thing, the re&s;olution they gave me. But, to tell you true, this &s;eemed a little too much accommodated to our Chri&s;tianity, in re|&s;pect of what I had learned of it from &s;everal other <HI>Pendets.</HI></P>
<P>After this, I put them upon their <HI>Chronology,</HI> where they pretended to &s;hew me far higher Antiquities then all ours. They will not &s;ay, that the World is eternal; but they make it &s;o old, that I almo&s;t know not which is be&s;t. Its determined duration, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> is of four <HI>Dgugue.</HI> This <HI>Dgugue</HI> is a certain determined number of years, as among&s;t us we have a <HI>&s;eculum</HI> (an Age) with this difference, that an Age of ours con|tains only an hundred <HI>Years,</HI> but their <HI>Dgugue</HI> is made up of an hundred <HI>Lecques,</HI> that
<PB N="110" REF="390">
is, an hundred times hundred thou&s;and years. I do not preci&s;ely remember the number total of the years of each <HI>Dgugue;</HI> but this I know very well, that the fir&s;t, called <HI>Sate-Dgugue,</HI> is of twenty five <HI>Lecques</HI> of years: that the &s;econd, which they call <HI>Trita,</HI> is of above twelve <HI>Lecques:</HI> the third, called <HI>Duaper,</HI> of eight <HI>Lecques</HI> and &s;ixty four thou|&s;and years, if I remember well: and the fourth, called <HI>Kale-Dgugue,</HI> is of I know not how many <HI>Lecques.</HI> The three fir&s;t, &s;ay they, and much of the fourth, are elap&s;ed; &s;o that the World &s;hall not la&s;t &s;o long as it hath done, becau&s;e it is to peri&s;h at the end of the fourth, all things being then to return to their fir&s;t Principles. I made them com|pute again and again, to have their age of the World aright; but finding that that perplexed them, and that they agreed not among them&s;elves about the number of the <HI>Lecques,</HI> I contented my &s;elf to &s;ee that they make the World exceeding old. But be|ing pre&s;&s;ed a little to make out this Antiquity, they pay you with nothing but little &s;tories, and at length come to this, that they find it &s;o in their <HI>Beths,</HI> or the Books of their Law, given them by the hands of <HI>Brahma.</HI></P>
<P>After this I urged them concerning the nature of the <HI>De&uuml;tas,</HI> of which I de&s;ired to be particularly in&s;tructed; but I received nothing but what was very confu&s;ed. They &s;aid, <HI>that</HI> there were three &s;orts of them, Good, Evil, and Indifferent ones, that were neither good nor bad; <HI>that</HI> &s;ome thought, they were made of Fire, others of Light; others that they were <HI>Biapek,</HI> of which word I could not get a clear explication; only they &s;aid, that God was <HI>Biapek,</HI> and our Soul was <HI>Biapek,</HI> and what is <HI>Biapek</HI> is incorruptible, and depends neither from Time nor Place: <HI>That</HI> others would have them to be nothing el&s;e but Portions of the Deity; and la&s;tly, that &s;ome there were, that made them cer|tain kinds of Divinities &s;evered and di&s;pen&s;ed over the World.</P>
<P>I remember, that I al&s;o put them upon the nature of the <HI>Lengue-cherire,</HI> which &s;ome of their Authors do admit: But I could obtain nothing el&s;e of it but what I had long &s;ince under&s;tood from our <HI>Pendet,</HI> which was, That the &s;eeds of Plants and Animals are not formed anew, but were contrived in the fir&s;t production of the World, and di&s;pen&s;ed abroad every where and mixed in all things; and that they are (not only potentially but actually) the very and entire Plants and Animals, though &s;o &s;mall, that their parts cannot be di&s;tingui&s;ht, but when being put into a convenient womb, and there nouri&s;hed, they extend them&s;elves and increa&s;e: So that the &s;eeds of an Ap|ple and Pear-Tree are a <HI>Lengue-cherire,</HI> that is, a little entire and perfect Apple and Pear-Tree, having all its e&s;&s;ential parts: And &s;o the &s;eeds of an Hor&s;e, an Elephant, and a Man, &amp;c. are a <HI>Lengue-cherire;</HI> a little Hor&s;e, a little Elephant, a little Man, in which there wants nothing but the Soul and Nouri&s;hment to make them appear what they are.</P>
<P>For a conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall di&s;cover to you the my&s;tery of a great <HI>Cabala,</HI> which in the&s;e la&s;t years hath made great noi&s;e in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> becau&s;e certain <HI>Pendets,</HI> or Heatheni&s;h Doctors, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it the minds of <HI>Dara</HI> and <HI>Sultan-Sujah,</HI> the two fir&s;t Sons of <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot but know the Doctrine of many of the Antient Philo&s;ophers, touching that great <HI>Soul of the World,</HI> which they will have our Souls and tho&s;e of Animals to be por|tions of. If we did well penetrate into <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> we might perhaps find that they were of this &s;entiment. It is in a manner the general Doctrine of the Heathen <HI>Pen|dets</HI> of the Indies, and 'tis the &s;ame which &s;till maketh the <HI>Cabala</HI> of the <HI>Soufys,</HI> and of the greate&s;t part of the learned Men in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and which is found explained in <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Ver&s;es, &s;o &s;ublime and emphatical in their <HI>Goultchen-raz</HI> or Parterre of My&s;teries: which is al&s;o the very &s;ame of Dr. <HI>Flud</HI>'s, whom our great <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI> hath &s;o learnedly refuted; and that wherein mo&s;t Chymi&s;ts lo&s;e them&s;elves. But the&s;e Indian Cabali&s;ts or <HI>Tendets</HI> I &s;peak of, drive this impertinence farther than all tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, and pretend, that God, or that Soveraign Being, which they call <HI>Achar,</HI> (immutable,) hath produced or drawn out of his own &s;ub&s;tance, not only <HI>Souls,</HI> but al&s;o whatever is <HI>material</HI> and corporeal in the Univer&s;e; and that this production was not meerly made by way of an efficient cau&s;e, but by a way re&s;embling a Spider that produceth a Webb, which it draws forth out of its own body, and takes in again when it will. <HI>Creation</HI> therefore, &s;ay the&s;e Doctors, is nothing el&s;e but an extraction and exten&s;ion, which God maketh of his own Sub&s;tance, of tho&s;e webbs he draws from his own bowels; as <HI>De&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ction</HI> is nothing el&s;e but a repri&s;al, or taking back again this Divine Sub&s;tance, and the&s;e Divine webbs into him&s;elf: So that the la&s;t day of the World, which they call <HI>Maper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;</HI> or <HI>Pralca,</HI> when they believe that all &s;hall be de&s;troyed, &s;hall be nothing el&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="390">
but a general repri&s;al of all tho&s;e webbs which God had drawn forth out of him&s;elf. There is therefore nothing <HI>(&s;o they go on)</HI> that is real or effactive in all we think, we &s;ee, hear, &s;mell, ta&s;te or touch: all this World is nothing but a kind of Dream and a meer Illu&s;ion, in regard that all this multiplicity and diver&s;ity of things that appear to us, is nothing but one and the &s;ame thing, which is <HI>God him&s;elf;</HI> as all tho&s;e &s;everal Num|bers of 10, 20, 100, 1000, &amp;c. are indeed nothing but one and the &s;ame unity many times repeated. But if you demand any rea&s;on for this phanta&s;ie, or any explication of the manner, how this i&s;&s;uing <HI>from</HI> and repri&s;al <HI>into</HI> the &s;ub&s;tance of God, this ex|ten&s;ion, and this variety of things is made; or how it can be, that God, being not cor|poreal but <HI>Biapek</HI> and incorruptible, (as they acknowledge) &s;hould yet be divi&s;ible into &s;o many portions of Bodies and Souls; they never make any other return, but of &s;ome pretty compari&s;ons, as, That God is like an immen&s;e <HI>Ocean,</HI> in which if many Vials full of Water &s;hould be floating, they would, wherever they &s;hould move, be found al|ways in the &s;ame Ocean, in the &s;ame Water; and that coming to break, their Water would at the &s;ame time be united with their whole, and with that great Ocean of which they were portions. Or they will tell you, that it is with God as with <HI>Light,</HI> which is the &s;ame through the whole Univer&s;e, and which yet appears an hundred dif|ferent ways, according to the diver&s;ity of the Objects it falls upon, or according to the &s;everal colours and &s;hapes of Gla&s;&s;es through which it &s;hineth. They will pay you, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> only with &s;uch kind of &s;imilitudes, that bear no proportion at all with God, and are good for nothing, but to ca&s;t du&s;t into the eyes of the ignorant people: And you mu&s;t not expect any &s;olid An&s;wer from them, if you &s;hould tell them, that tho&s;e Vials would indeed be in a <HI>like</HI> Water, but not in <HI>the &s;ame;</HI> and that it is indeed a <HI>like</HI> light o|ver all the World, but not <HI>the &s;ame:</HI> or if you &s;hould make any other objections a|gain&s;t them, they return always to the &s;ame compari&s;ons, pretty expre&s;&s;ions, or as the <HI>Soufys,</HI> to the fine Ver&s;es of their <HI>Goultchen-raz.</HI></P>
<P>Now Sir, what think you? Had I not rea&s;on, from this great heap of extravagancies, I mean, from that panick and childi&s;h terror &s;truck into tho&s;e Indians by Eclip&s;es; from that &s;uper&s;titious compa&s;&s;ion for the Sun to deliver it from that black <HI>Daemon,</HI> accompanied with tho&s;e Api&s;h Prayers, Wa&s;hings, Plungings, and Alms ca&s;t into the River; from that mad and infernal ob&s;tinacy of the Women, burning them&s;elves with the Corps's of their Husbands; from tho&s;e &s;everal madne&s;&s;es of the <HI>Fakires;</HI> and la&s;tly, from all that fabulous &s;tuff of the <HI>Beths</HI> and other Indian Books: Had I not rea&s;on, I &s;ay, to premi&s;e in the title of this Letter; (which is but a poor advantage to me from &s;o long travelling) <HI>That there are no opinions &s;o ridiculous or extravagant, of which the mind of man is not capable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To conclude,</HI> I have no more to add then to de&s;ire you, to do me the favour and de|liver with your own hands the Letter to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chapelle.</HI> It is he that fir&s;t procured me that familiar acquaintance I had with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi,</HI> your intimate and Illu&s;trious Friend, that hath been &s;o advantagious to me; which maketh me acknowledge my great obligations to him, and exceedingly engageth me to love him, and to remember him in what part of the World &s;oever I am: As I am no le&s;s bound to honour you as long as I live; as well for the peculiar affection you have always expre&s;&s;ed to me, as for the good coun&s;el you have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with in your many letters during the whole cour&s;e of my voyages, and for that favour of &s;ending to me with &s;o much genero&s;ity (without intere&s;t or mony) unto the end of the World: whither my curio&s;ity had carried me, a Che&s;t of Books, when tho&s;e, of whom I demanded them for mony, ordered by me to be paid at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and who &s;hould have hone&s;tly &s;ent them me, abandoned me there, and laught at all my Letters, looking upon me as a lo&s;t man, whom they &s;hould never &s;ee again.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Occa&s;ion and Cau&s;e of this Voyage of <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> together with an account of the &s;tate and po&s;ture of his Army, and the Equipage and ordi|nary Provi&s;ions of the chief of his <HI>Cavalry;</HI> and &s;ome curious particulars ob&s;ervable in the Voyages of the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> began to find him&s;elf in better health, it hath been con&s;tantly reported, that he would make a Voyage to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and go from thence to <HI>Kachemire,</HI> to change the Air, and to be out of the way of the approaching Summer heats, for fear of a relap&s;e: That the more intelligent &s;ort of men would hardly be per&s;waded, that as long as he kept his Father <HI>Chah-jean</HI> pri&s;oner in the Fort of <HI>Agra,</HI> he would think it &s;afe to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance. Yet notwith&s;tanding we have found, that Rea&s;on of State hath given place to that of Health, or rather to the Intrigues of <HI>Raucbenara-Begum,</HI> who was wild to breath a more free Air than that of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and to have her turn in &s;hewing her &s;elf to a gallant and magnificent Army, as her Si&s;ter <HI>Begum-&s;abeb</HI> had formerly done during the Reign of <HI>Chah-jean.</HI></P>
<P>He departed then the 6^t^h of <HI>December,</HI> about three a clock in the afternoon; a day and hour that mu&s;t needs be fortunate for a great Voyage, if we may give credit to the Gentlemen <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> who have &s;o decreed it. And he arrived at <HI>Chach-limar,</HI> his Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, di&s;tant about two Leagues from hence; where he &s;pent &s;ix whole dayes, thereby to give to all &s;ufficient time to make nece&s;&s;ary preparations for a Voyage, that would take up a year and an half. We have this day news, that he is gone to encamp on the way of <HI>Lahor,</HI> and that when he hath &s;tay'd there two dayes, he intends to continue his march without any further expectation. He hath with him not only the Thirty five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, or thereabout, and 10000 Foot, but al&s;o both his Artilleries, the great or heavy, and the &s;mall or lighter, which is call'd, <HI>The drtillery of the Stirrup,</HI> becau&s;e it is in&s;eparable from the per&s;on of the King, whereas the Heavy &s;ometimes leaveth him to keep the high and well beaten Roads.</P>
<P>The Great Artillery is made up of &s;eventy pieces of Cannon, mo&s;t of them ca&s;t; of which &s;ome are &s;o ponderous, that they need twenty yoke of Oxen to draw them; and &s;ome of them require Elephants to help all tho&s;e Oxen, by thru&s;ting and drawing the wheels of the Wagons with their Trunks and Heads when they &s;tick in any deep way, or are to pa&s;s &s;ome &s;teep mountain. That of the <HI>Stirrup</HI> is compo&s;ed of fifty or
<PB N="113" REF="391">
&s;ixty &s;mall Field-pieces, all of Bra&s;s, each carried upon a little pritty and painted Chariot (as hath been already &s;aid in another place) beautified with many little red Streamers, and drawn by two very hand&s;om Hor&s;es, driven by the Gunner him&s;elf, to|gether with a third Hor&s;e, which the Gunners A&s;&s;i&s;tant leads for a relief. All the&s;e Chariots go alwaies a great pace, that they may be &s;oon enough in order before the Tent of the King, and di&s;charge all at once at the time of his entry, to give the Army notice.</P>
<P>All the&s;e great preparations give us cau&s;e to apprehend, that in &s;tead of going to <HI>Kachemire,</HI> we be not led to be&s;iege that important City of <HI>Kandahar,</HI> which is the Frontier to <HI>Per&s;ia, Indo&s;tan</HI> and <HI>&V;sbeck,</HI> and the Capital of an excellent Country, yield|ing a very great Revenue, and which for this very rea&s;on hath been ever the bone of contention between the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> Whatever it be, there is now a nece&s;&s;ity to di&s;patch at <HI>Dehli,</HI> any bu&s;ine&s;s what&s;oever notwith&s;tanding; and I &s;hould find my &s;elf much ca&s;t behind the Army, if I &s;hould tarry any longer: Be&s;ides I know, that my <HI>Navab,</HI> or <HI>Agab Danech-mend-kan</HI> &s;tays for me abroad with impatience: He can no more be without philo&s;ophi&s;ing in the afternoon upon the Books of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> and <HI>De&s;-Cartes,</HI> upon the <HI>Globe</HI> and the <HI>Sphere,</HI> or upon <HI>Anatomy,</HI> than he can be without be&s;towing the whole morning upon the weighty matters of the Kingdom, in the quality of Secre|tary of State for forrain Affairs, and of Great Ma&s;ter of the Cavalry. I &s;hall depart this night, after I have given the la&s;t order for all my bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, and provided all nece&s;&s;aries for my Voyage, as all the principal per&s;ons of the Cavalry do; that is, two good Tartarian Hor&s;es, whereto I am obliged by rea&s;on of the one hundred and fifty Crowns of pay, which I have by the month; a Camel of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and a Groom; a Cook, and another Servant, which mu&s;t be had ordinarily to march in the&s;e Countries before the Hor&s;e, and to carry a Flagon with water in his hand. I al&s;o have provided the ordi|nary Uten&s;ils, &s;uch as are a Tent of a middle &s;ize, and a proportionate piece of foot-Tapi&s;try; and a little Bed with girdles, made up with four &s;trong and light Canes, and a Pillow for the head; two Coverlets, whereof one folded up fourfold &s;erveth for a Matra&s;&s;e; a round Table-cloth of Leather to eat upon; &s;ome Napkins of dyed Cloth, and three &s;mall Sacks for Plate, which are put up in a greater Sack, and this &s;ack into a very great and &s;trong Sack made of Girdles, in which are put all the provi&s;ions, to|gether with the Linnen of the Ma&s;ter and Servants. I have al&s;o made provi&s;ion of ex|cellent Rice for five or &s;ix dayes, for fear I &s;hould not alwayes find &s;o good; of &s;ome &s;weet Bi&s;cuit, with Sugar and Anis; of a linnen &s;leeve with its little iron-hook, to let, by the means thereof, run and to keep curdled milk; and of &s;tore of Limons with Sugar, to make Limonade; &s;uch Milk and Limonade being the two great and &s;overaign refre&s;hments of the <HI>Indies:</HI> All which, as I &s;aid, is put into the la&s;t named Sack, which is &s;o large and heavy, that three or four men have pains enough to lift it up: though two men do fir&s;t fold and turn one &s;ide upon the other when it is full, and though the Camel be made to &s;toop very nigh it, and there need no more than to turn one of the &s;ides of that Sack upon the Camel. All this equipage and provi&s;ion is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Voyages as the&s;e. We mu&s;t not look for &s;uch good lodging and accommodations as we have in our Country. We mu&s;t re&s;olve to encamp and live after the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> mode, without expecting any other Inns than Tents. Nor mu&s;t we think to plunder the Country-man; all the Lands of the Kingdom being in propriety to the King: We are well to con&s;ider, that we mu&s;t be &s;ober and prudent, and that to ruine the Country man, were to ruine the Deme&s;ne of the King. That which much comforts me in this march, is, that we go North-ward, and depart in the beginning of the Winter after the rains; which is the right &s;ea&s;on for travelling in the <HI>Indies,</HI> becau&s;e it raineth not, and we are not &s;o much incommoded by heat and du&s;t. Be&s;ides that, I find my &s;elf out of danger of eating the bread of <HI>Bazar,</HI> or of the Mar|ket, which ordinarily is ill baked, full of &s;and and du&s;t; nor obliged to drink of tho&s;e naughty waters which being all turbid, and full of na&s;tine&s;s of &s;o many people and bea&s;ts that fetch thence, and enter into them, do cau&s;e &s;uch fevers, which are very hard to cure, and which breed al&s;o certain very dangerous worms in the legs. They at fir&s;t cau&s;e a great inflamation, accompanied with a fever, and ordinarily come forth a little after the Voyage although there have been &s;ome, that have &s;tay'd a whole year and more before they appear'd. They are commonly of the bigne&s;s and length of a &s;mall Vial-&s;tring, &s;o that one would &s;ooner take them for &s;ome nerve than for a worm; and they mu&s;t be drawn out little by little, from day to day, gently winding them
<PB N="114" REF="392">
about a little twig of the bigne&s;s of a needle, for fear of breaking them. This, I &s;ay, comforteth me not a little, that I find my &s;elf exempt from the&s;e inconveniencies; my <HI>Navab</HI> having vouch&s;afed me a very particular favour; which is, that he hath appoint|ed to give me every day a new loaf of his hou&s;e, and a <HI>Souray</HI> of the water of <HI>Ganges,</HI> with which he hath laden &s;everal Camels of his train, as the whole Court doth. <HI>Souray</HI> is that Tin-flagon full of water, which the Servant, that marcheth on foot before the Gentleman on hor&s;eback, carrieth in his hand, wrap't up in a &s;leeve of red cloth. Or|dinarily it holdeth but one pinte; but I had &s;ome of them expre&s;ly made, that hold two. We &s;hall &s;ee, whether this cunning will &s;ucceed. The water cooleth very well in this Flagon, provided that care be had alwayes to keep the &s;leeve moi&s;t, and that the Servant that holds it in his hand, do march and &s;tir the air, or el&s;e that it be held towards the wind; as is commonly done upon three pretty little &s;ticks, cro&s;&s;ing one another, that they may not touch the earth; For the moi&s;tne&s;s of the linnen, the agi|tation of the air, or the wind, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep the water fre&s;h; as if this moi&s;tne&s;s, or rather the water imbibed by the &s;leeve did keep out the little igneous bodies or &s;pirits that are in the air, at the &s;ame time when it giveth entrance to the nitrous or other parts, which hinder the motion in the water, and cau&s;e coolne&s;s; in the &s;ame manner as Gla&s;s keeps out Water, and giveth pa&s;&s;age to the Light, by rea&s;on of the particular texture and di&s;po&s;ition of the parts of the Gla&s;s, and the diver&s;ity there mu&s;t be between the particles of Light and tho&s;e of Water. We do not u&s;e this Tin-flagon for keeping our water cool but in the field: When we are at home, we have Jars of a certain porous Earth, in which it is much better cooled, provided it be expos'd to the wind, and moi&s;ten'd with a Linnen-cloth, as the Flagon; or el&s;e, u&s;e is made of Salt-peter, as all per&s;ons of quality do, whether in Towns, or in the Army. They put water, or any other liquor, to be cooled, in a round and long necked Tin|flagon, &s;uch as are the Engli&s;h Bottles, and for the &s;pace of half a quarter of an hour this Flagon is &s;tirr'd in water, into which hath been ca&s;t three or four handfuls of Salt-peter; this maketh the water very cold, neither is it unwhol&s;ome, as I did ap|prehend; but only that &s;ometimes it cau&s;eth gripings at fir&s;t when one is not accu&s;tom|ed to it.</P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e, to play &s;o much the Philo&s;opher, when we &s;hould think to de|part, and to endure the Sun, which at all &s;ea&s;ons is incommodious in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to &s;wallow the du&s;t, which is never wanting in the Army; to put up, to load, and to unload every day our Baggage, to help the Servants to fa&s;ten &s;ticks, to draw Cords, to put up Tents, and to take them down again, to march in the day, and in the night, to devour cold and heat, and in a word, to turn <HI>Arabians</HI> for a year and an half, during which time we are to be in the Field. <HI>Adieu;</HI> I &s;hall not fail to acquit my &s;elf of my promi&s;e, and from time to time to inform you of our Adventures; and be&s;ides, &s;ince the Army for this time will make but &s;mall Journeys in its march, and pa&s;s on with all that pomp and magnificence, which the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> do affect, I &s;hall endeavour to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t con&s;iderable things, that I may impart them to you, as &s;oon as we &s;hall arrive at <HI>Lahor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND LETTER;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONTAINING</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Number and Magnificence, the Order and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Tents o the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> in the Field: The Number of Elephants, Camels, Mules, and Porters, nece&s;&s;ary to carry them: The Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Bazars</HI> or Royal Markets: That of the particular Quarters of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> or Lords, and of the re&s;t of the Army: The extent of the whole Army, when encamped: The confu&s;ion there met with; and how it may be avoided: The Order of preventing Robberies: The different Manners of the March of the King, the Prince&s;&s;es, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Seraglio:</HI> The danger there is in being too near the Women: The &s;everal ways of the Royal Hunting, and how the King hunts with his whole Army: The abundance of people there is in the Army, and the method of making them all &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis indeed is called marching with gravity, and as we &s;peak here <HI>a la Mogole,:</HI> it is no more but fifteen or &s;ixteen dayes Journey from <HI>Dehli</HI> to <HI>Lahor,</HI> which make lit|tle more than &s;ix&s;core Leagues; and yet we have &s;pent almo&s;t two months on this way. 'Tis true, the King with the be&s;t part of the Army went &s;omewhat a&s;ide from the high way, the better to enjoy the diverti&s;ements of Hunting, and for the conveniency of the water of <HI>Gemna,</HI> which we went to look for on the right hand, and which we lei&s;urely followed long enough in our hunting, cro&s;&s;ing fields of tall gra&s;s, full of all &s;orts of game, where the Hor&s;emen could &s;carce be &s;een. At pre&s;ent, whil&s;t we are at re&s;t, I am going to make good what I have promi&s;ed you in the Title of this Letter; ho|ping &s;hortly to make you come to <HI>Kachemire,</HI> and to &s;hew you one of the be&s;t Coun|tries in the World.</P>
<P>When the King is in the field, he hath u&s;ually two Camps, I mean two Bodies, of Tents &s;eparated, to the end that when he breaketh up and leaveth one, the other may have pa&s;&s;ed before by a day, and be found ready when he arriveth at the place de&s;ign'd to encamp it: And 'tis therefore, that they are called <HI>Peiche-kanes</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, Hou&s;es going before: The&s;e two <HI>Peiche-kanes</HI> are almo&s;t alike, and there are requi&s;ite a|bove three&s;core Elephants, more then two hundred Camels, above an hundred Mules, and as many more Porters to carry one of them. The <HI>Elephants</HI> carry the mo&s;t bulky things, &s;uch as are the great Tents, and their great Pillars, which being too long and too heavy, are taken down in three pieces. The <HI>Camels</HI> carry the le&s;&s;er Tents: The <HI>Mules,</HI> the Baggage and Kitchins. And to the <HI>Porters</HI> are given all the little moveables, and &s;uch as are delicate and fine, that might ea&s;ily be broken; as <HI>Porcelain,</HI> which the King u&s;ually imployeth at Table: tho&s;e painted and guilded Beds, and tho&s;e rich <HI>Karguais;</HI> which I &s;hall &s;peak of hereafter.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e two <HI>Peiche-kanes,</HI> or Bodies of Tents, is no &s;ooner arrived at the place de&s;igned for encamping, but the Great Mar&s;hal that orders the Lodging, chu&s;eth &s;ome fair place for the Kings Quarters; yet with a regard, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, to the Sym|mitry and order that is to be ob&s;erved for the whole Army; and he marketh out a Square, of which each &s;ide is above three hundred ordinary paces long. An hundred Pikemen pre&s;ently clear and level this pace, making &s;quare planes to rai&s;e the Tents upon, and &s;urrounding all this great Square with <HI>Kanates</HI> or Skreens &s;even or eight foot high, which they fa&s;ten with cords tyed to &s;ticks, and with perches fix't in the ground, by couples, from ten to ten paces, one without, and the other within, inclining the one upon the other. The&s;e <HI>Kanates</HI> are made of a &s;trong cloth lined with &s;tained Linnen. In the middle of one of the &s;ides of this Square is the Entry or Royal Gate, great and magnificent, and the Indian &s;tuff which 'tis made of, as al&s;o tho&s;e Stuffs, of which the whole &s;ide of the Square of the face is lined without, are far better and richer than the others.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="393">
The fir&s;t and the greate&s;t of the Tents, that is reared in this Inclo&s;ure, is called <HI>Am|kas,</HI> becau&s;e it is the place where the King and all the Lords in the Army do a&s;&s;emble about nine a clock in the morning, when the <HI>Mokam,</HI> that is, the u&s;ual publick Meet|ing is held. For, the Kings of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> although they are in a march, do not di&s;pence but very rarely with this almo&s;t inviolable cu&s;tom, which is pa&s;s'd into a kind of Du|ty and Law, <HI>viz.</HI> to appear twice a day in the A&s;&s;embly, there to give order for State-Affairs, and to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, which is little le&s;s than the fir&s;t, and a little further advanced into the Inclo&s;ure, is called, <HI>Go&s;l-kane,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a place to wa&s;h in: And here 'tis, where all the&punc; Lords every night meet, and where they come to &s;alute and do obei&s;ance to the King, as ordinarily they do when they are in the <HI>Metropolis.</HI> This A&s;&s;embly in the evening is very inconvenient to the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> but it is a thing that looks great and &s;tate|ly, to &s;ee a far off, in an ob&s;cure night, in the mid&s;t of a Campagne, cro&s;s all the Tents of an Army, long files of Torches lighting the&s;e <HI>Omrahs</HI> to the Kings Quarters, and attending them back again to their Tents. 'Tis true, that the&s;e lights are not of wax as ours, but they la&s;t very long. They are only an Iron put about a &s;tick, at the end of which are wound raggs of old Linnen from time to time, which is moi&s;tned with Oyl, held by the Link-men in their hands in a Bra&s;s, or Latton-flagon, with a long and &s;treight neck.</P>
<P>The third Tent, which is not much le&s;s than the two fir&s;t, and is yet further ad|vanced into the Inclo&s;ure, is called <HI>Kalvet-kane,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a retired or the Privy Council-place, becau&s;e none but the fir&s;t Officers of the Kingdom enter into it; and 'tis there where the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t important Affairs are tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>Yet further into the Square are the particular Tents of the King, encompa&s;s'd with &s;mall <HI>Kanates</HI> or Skreens, of the height of a man, and lined with &s;tained Indian Stuff, of that elegant workman&s;hip of <HI>Ma&s;lipatam,</HI> which do repre&s;ent an hundred &s;orts of different flowers: and &s;ome of them lined with flowred Sattin with large Silk fringes.</P>
<P>The Tents joyning to the Kings, are tho&s;e of the <HI>Begum</HI> or Prince&s;&s;es, and the other great Ladies and She-Officers of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which are likewi&s;e encompa&s;s'd, as tho&s;e of the King, with rich <HI>Kanates;</HI> and amid&s;t all the&s;e Tents are placed tho&s;e of the low|er She-Officers, and other &s;erving-Women, alwayes, upon the matter, in the &s;ame order, according to their Office.</P>
<P>The <HI>Am-kas,</HI> and the five or &s;ix principal Tents are rai&s;ed high, that they may be &s;een at a good di&s;tance, and the better fence off the heat. <HI>Without</HI> it is nothing but a cour&s;e and &s;trong red cloth, yet beautified and &s;triped with certain large &s;tripes, cut variou&s;ly and advantagiou&s;ly to the eye: But <HI>within</HI> it is lined with tho&s;e fine Indian flowred Stuffs, of the &s;ame work of <HI>Ma&s;lipatam;</HI> and this work is rai&s;ed and enriched with &s;ilk, gold and &s;ilver Embroideries having great Fringes, or with &s;ome fine flowred Sattin. The Pillars &s;upporting the&s;e Tents, are painted and guild; One marcheth on nothing but rich Tape&s;try, having matra&s;&s;es of Cotton under them four or five inches thick, and round about the&s;e Tape&s;tries there are great &s;quare Rails richly cover'd to lean upon.</P>
<P>In each of the two great Tents where the A&s;&s;embly is kept, there is rai&s;ed a Theater richly adorned, where the King giveth Audience under a great Canopy of Velvet, or purfled with gold. In the other Tents are found the like Canopies, and there you may &s;ee al&s;o &s;et up certain <HI>Karguais,</HI> that is, fine Cabinets, who&s;e little doors are &s;hut with Silver-locks. To conceive what they are, you may repre&s;ent to you two &s;mall Squares of our Skreens, &s;et upon one another, and neatly round about fa&s;tned to one another with a Silken-&s;tring; yet &s;o that the extremities of the &s;ides of the uppermo&s;t come to incline upon one another, &s;o as to make a kind of a little Tabernacle with this difference from our Skreens, that all the &s;ides of the&s;e are of very thin and &s;light Firr-boards, painted and guild without, and enriched round about with gold and Silk-fringes, and lined within with Scarlet, or flowred Sattin, or purfled with Gold.</P>
<P>And this is very near what I can tell you of what is contained within the great Square.</P>
<P>What concerns the particulars that are without the Square; there are fir&s;t two pretty Tents on both the two &s;ides of the great Entry or Royal Gate, where are found two choice Hor&s;es &s;adled, and richly harne&s;s'd, and altogether ready to be mounted upon occa&s;ion, or rather for State and Magnificence.</P>
<P>On the two &s;ides of the &s;ame Gate are placed in order tho&s;e fifty or three&s;core &s;mall
<PB N="117" REF="393">
Field-pieces, that make up the <HI>Artillery</HI> of the <HI>Sirrup</HI> above mention'd, and which di&s;|charge all together to &s;alute the King entring into his Tent, and to give notice thereof to the whole Army.</P>
<P>Before the Gate there is alwayes left void, as much as may be, a great place, at the end of which there is a great Tent, called <HI>Nagar-kane,</HI> becau&s;e that is the place of the Timbals and Trumpets.</P>
<P>Near this Tent there is another great one, which is called <HI>Tchauky-kane,</HI> becau&s;e it is the place where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> keep guard, every one in his turn, once a week twenty four hours together; yet notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> on the day of their guard, cau&s;e, clo&s;e by, to be rear'd one of their own Tents, to be the more at liberty, and to have more elbow room.</P>
<P>Round about the three other &s;ides of the great Square are &s;et up all the Tents of the Officers, which are alwayes found in the &s;ame order and di&s;po&s;ition, unle&s;s it be that the place permit it not: They have all their peculiar names; but as they are hard to pro|nounce, and I pretend not to teach you the Language of the Country, it will be &s;uffici|ent to tell you, that there is a particular one for the Arms of the King; another for the rich Harne&s;&s;es of Hor&s;es; another for Ve&s;ts purfled with Gold, which are the ordina|ry Pre&s;ents be&s;tow'd by the King. Be&s;ides, there are four more, near one another; the fir&s;t of which is de&s;igned for keeping Fruit; the &s;econd for Comfits; the third for <HI>Ganges</HI> water, and the Salt-peter to cool it; and the fourth for the <HI>Betele,</HI> which is that Leaf, whereof I have &s;poken el&s;ewhere, which is offered to friends, as <HI>Coffee</HI> is in <HI>Turkie,</HI> and chew'd to make ruddy lips, and a &s;weet breath. Next to the&s;e, there are fifteen or &s;ixteen others that &s;erve for Kitchins and what belongs to them. Among&s;t all the&s;e Tents are tho&s;e of a great number of Officers and Eunuchs. La&s;tly, there are four or five long ones for led Hor&s;es, and &s;ome others for the be&s;t Elephants; and all tho&s;e that are for hunting. For there mu&s;t needs be a retreat for all that great number of Birds of prey, that are always carried for Game and Magnificence; and &s;o there mu&s;t be for tho&s;e many <HI>Dogs,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Leopards</HI> &s;erving to take wild Goats; for tho&s;e <HI>Nilgaus,</HI> or gray Oxen, which I take for <HI>Elcks;</HI> for the&s;e <HI>Lions</HI> and <HI>Rhinocero&s;</HI>'s, that are led for greatne&s;s; for tho&s;e great <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s of <HI>Bengale</HI> fighting with Lions; and la&s;tly for tho&s;e tamed wild Goats, they call <HI>Gazelles,</HI> that are made to &s;port before the King.</P>
<P>This va&s;t number of Tents, now &s;poken of, together with tho&s;e that are within the great Square, make up the King's Quarter, which is always in the middle, and as 'twere in the center of the Army, except the place do not allow it. It will ea&s;ily be thence concluded, that this Quarter of the King mu&s;t needs be &s;omething great and royal, and afford a very fine pro&s;pect, if one behold from &s;ome high place this great bo|dy of red Tents in the mid&s;t of the Army, encamped in a fair and even Campagne, where may be fully &s;een all that order and di&s;po&s;ition that is to be ob&s;erved in the whole.</P>
<P>After that the Great Mar&s;hal of the Camp hath cho&s;en a place fit for the Kings's Quar|ter, and hath made the <HI>Am-kas</HI> to be &s;et up highe&s;t of all the Tents, and by which he is to take his mea&s;ure for the ordering and di&s;po&s;ing the re&s;t of the Army accordingly; He then marketh out the Royal <HI>Bazars</HI> or Markets, whence the whole Army is fur|ni&s;ht with nece&s;&s;aries; drawing the fir&s;t and the chief of all, like a great Street running &s;traight, and a great free way traver&s;ing the whole Army, now on the right hand, and by and by on the left of the <HI>Am-kas</HI> and the King's Quarter, and always in the &s;traight|e&s;t line that may be towards the encamping of the next day. All the Royal <HI>Bazars,</HI> that are neither &s;o long nor &s;o broad, commonly cro&s;s this fir&s;t, &s;ome on this, others on the other &s;ide of the King's Quarter; and all the&s;e <HI>Bazars</HI> are di&s;cern'd by very high Canes like great pearches, which are fixt in the ground from three hundred to three hundred paces or thereabout, with red Standards, and Cows-tailes of the great <HI>Ti|bet</HI> fa&s;tned on the top of the&s;e Canes like Perirwigs.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Mar&s;hal de&s;igns, next, the place of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o as they may always keep the &s;ame order, and be ever as near as may be the King's Quarter; &s;ome on the right, others on the left hand, &s;ome on this &s;ide of him, others beyond him; &s;o that none of them may change the place that hath been once appointed for him, or that him|&s;elf hath de&s;ired in the begining of the Voyage.</P>
<P>The Quarters of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas,</HI> as to their particular order and di&s;po&s;ition, are to be imagined in a manner like that of the King: For commonly they have two <HI>Peiche-kanes</HI> with a Square of <HI>Kanates,</HI> which inclo&s;eth their principal Tent and tho&s;e of their Women; and round about the&s;e are put up the Tents of their Officers and
<PB N="118" REF="394">
Cavaliers&punc; with a peculiar <HI>Bazar&punc;</HI> which is a &s;treet of &s;mall Tents for the lower &s;ort of people that follows the Army, and furni&s;heth the Camp with Forage, Grains, Rice, Butter, and the other things that are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; whereby they are &s;o accommoda|ted, that they need not always go to the Royal <HI>Bazars,</HI> where generally all things are to be found as in the Capital City. Each <HI>Bazar</HI> is marked at the two ends by two Canes planted in the ground, which are ast all as tho&s;e of the Royal <HI>Bazars,</HI> that &s;o at a good di&s;tance the particular Standards fa&s;tned to to them may be di&s;covered, and the &s;eve|ral quarters di&s;tingui&s;h't from one another.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas</HI> affect to have their Tents very high. But they mu&s;t beware le&s;t they be too high, becau&s;e it may happen, that the King, pa&s;&s;ing by, might perceive it, and command them to be thrown down; of which we have &s;een an ex|ample in this la&s;t march. Neither mu&s;t they be altogether red from without, &s;ince tho&s;e of the King alone are to be &s;o. La&s;tly, out of re&s;pect they mu&s;t all look towards the <HI>Am-kas,</HI> or the Quarter of the King.</P>
<P>The re&s;idue of the &s;pace between the Kings Quarter, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and the <HI>Bazars,</HI> is taken up by the Tents of the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars</HI> or little <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and of that infi|nite number of great and &s;mall Merchants that follow the Army; of all tho&s;e that belong to the Law; and la&s;tly, of all &s;uch as &s;erve both the Artilleries: Which maketh indeed a prodigious number of Tents, and requireth a very great extent of ground. Yet it is not all true what is &s;aid of either of them. And I believe, that when the whole Ar|my is in a fair and even Campagne, where it may encamp with ea&s;e, and that, follow|ing the ordinary plot, it comes at length to be lodged, as near as may be, in a round (as we have often &s;een it does, upon this road) the compa&s;s of it will not be above two Leagues, or two Leagues and an half; and with all this there will yet be left here and there &s;everal void places. But then the great Artillery, which taketh up a great tract of ground, very often a day or two go before.</P>
<P>Nor is all true, what is &s;aid of the &s;trange confu&s;ion, which commonly &s;trikes an a&s;toni&s;hment into all new comers. For a little acquaintance with the method of the Army, and &s;ome heeding of the order ob&s;erved in the Camp, will &s;oon enable one to avoid all embara&s;ment, and to go to and fro about his bu&s;ine&s;s, and to find his quarter again; fora&s;much as every one regulateth him&s;elf by the King's Quarter, and the par|ticular Tents and Standards of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that may be &s;een afar off, and by the Stan|dards and Perriwigs of the Royal <HI>Bazars,</HI> which may al&s;o be &s;een at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Yet for all the&s;e marks it will &s;ometimes fall out, that one &s;hall be extreamly per|plexed, and even in the day time, but e&s;pecially in the morning, when a world of people do arrive, and every one of tho&s;e is bu&s;ie and &s;eeks to lodge him&s;elf: And that not only, becau&s;e there is often rai&s;ed &s;o great a du&s;t, that the King's Quarter, the Standards of the <HI>Bazars</HI> and the <HI>Omrahs</HI> (which might &s;erve for guides) cannot be di&s;cover'd: But becau&s;e a man finds him&s;elf between Tents that are putting up, and be+tween cords, which the le&s;&s;er <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that have no <HI>Peiche-kane,</HI> and the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars</HI> &s;tretch out to mark their lodgings, and to hinder, that no way may be made nigh them, or that no unknown per&s;on may come to lodge near their Tents, where often they have their Women: If in this ca&s;e you mean to get by on one &s;ide, you will find the wayes ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e &s;tretched-out cords, which a troup of mean Serving-men &s;tanding there with big cudgels, will not &s;uffer to be lower'd, to &s;uffer the Baggage to pa&s;s. If you will turn back, you'l find the wayes &s;hut &s;ince you pa&s;&s;ed. And here it is, where you mu&s;t cry out, &s;torm, intreat, make as if you would &s;trike, and yet well be|ware of doing &s;o, leaving the men, as well as you can, to quarrel again&s;t one another, and afterwards to accord them for fear of &s;ome mi&s;chief; and in &s;hort, to put your &s;elf into all imaginable po&s;tures to get away thence, and to make your Camels pa&s;s: But the great trouble is, when a man is obliged to go in an evening to a place &s;omewhat re|mote; becau&s;e that tho&s;e offen&s;ive &s;moaks of the fire of green Wood, of Cow&s;hares, of Camel-dung, which the common people then make in their kitchins, do rai&s;e a mi&s;t (e&s;pecially when there is no wind) &s;o thick, that you can &s;ee nothing at all. I have been three or four times &s;urprized with it, &s;o as not to know what to do. Well might I ask the way; I knew not whither I went, and I did nothing but turn. Once, among other times, I was con&s;trained to &s;tay &s;till this mi&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and the Moon ri&s;en. And another time I was forced to get to the <HI>Aguacy-die,</HI> to lye down at the foot thereof, and there to pa&s;s all the night as well as I could, having my Servant and Hor&s;e by me. This <HI>Aguacy-die</HI> is like a tall Ma&s;t, but very &s;lender, which can be taken down in three

pieces, and 'tis planted toward the King's Quarter, near that Tent which is called <HI>Nagar-kane.</HI> In the evening is drawn up to the top of it a Lanthorn with a light burn|ing in it all night long; which is very commodious, as being &s;een a great way off; and thither it is that people gone a&s;tray do retire, from thence to get again to the <HI>Bazars,</HI> and to ask the way, or there to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the night; for no body hinders one from doing &s;o, and a man may be there in &s;afety from Robbers. It is called <HI>Aguacy-die,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>light of Heaven,</HI> in regard that from a far off it appears like a Star.</P>
<P>For the prevention of Robberies, each <HI>Omrah</HI> cau&s;eth a guard to be kept all the night long, in his particular Camp, of &s;uch men that perpetually go the round, and cry <HI>Kaber-dar,</HI> have a care. Be&s;ides, there are round about the Army &s;et guards, at five hundred common paces from one another, that keep a fire, and cry al&s;o <HI>Kaber-dar.</HI> And over and above all the&s;e, the <HI>Cotoual,</HI> who is, as 'twere, the great Prevo&s;t, &s;ends out Troups of Guards every way, that pa&s;s through all the <HI>Bazars,</HI> crying out and trumpetting all night long. Yet for all this, &s;ome robberries there are now and then committed; and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary alwayes to be upon ones guard, to go to &s;leep by times, that &s;o you may be awake the re&s;t of the night, and not to tru&s;t your &s;ervants too much to keep guard for you.</P>
<P>But let us now &s;ee, how many different wayes the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> is carried in the Field.</P>
<P>Ordinarily he cau&s;eth him&s;elf to be carried on mens &s;houlders, in a kind of Sedan or Litter, upon which is a <HI>Tact-raven,</HI> that is, a Field-throne, on which he is &s;eated: And this is like a magnificent, Tabernacle with pillars, painted and guilded, which may be &s;hut with gla&s;s, when 'tis ill weather; the four branches of the Litter are cover'd with Scarlet or purpled Gold, with great Gold and Silk-fringes; and at each branch there are two robu&s;t and well-cloathed Porters, that change by turns with as many more that follow.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o he goeth on Hor&s;e-back, e&s;pecially when 'tis a fair day for hunting. At other times he rideth on an Elephant, in a <HI>Mik-dember,</HI> or <HI>Hauze;</HI> and this is the mo&s;t &s;plendid appearance: For, the Elephant is decked with a very rich and very mag|nificent Harna&s;s; the <HI>Mik-dember,</HI> being a little &s;quare Hou&s;e or Turret of Wood, is alwayes painted and guilded; and the <HI>Hauze,</HI> which is an Oval &s;eat, having a Canopy with Pillars over it, is &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the&s;e different Marches he is alwayes accompanied with a great number of <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Rajas</HI> following him clo&s;e and thick on hor&s;e-back without any great order: And all tho&s;e that are in the Army are obliged to be at the <HI>Amkas</HI> at break of day, unle&s;s he do exempt them from it upon the account either of their peculiar Office, or their great Age. This march is very inconvenient to them, e&s;pecially on hunting dayes; for they mu&s;t endure the Sun and Du&s;t as the &s;imple Souldiers, and that &s;ometimes until three of the clock in the afternoon; whereas, when they do not attend the King, they go at ea&s;e in their <HI>Palekys,</HI> clo&s;e cover'd, if they plea&s;e, free from the Sun and Du&s;t; &s;leeping in them couched all along as in a bed, and &s;o coming in good time to their Tent, which expects them with a ready dinner, their kitchin being gone the night before, after &s;upper. About the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and among&s;t them, there is alwayes a good number of Hor&s;e-men well mounted, call'd <HI>Gourze-berdars,</HI> becau&s;e they carry a kind of Silver-Mace of Armes. There are al&s;o many of them about the right and left wings, that precede the per&s;on of the King, together with &s;tore of Foot men. The&s;e <HI>Gourze|berdars</HI> are Choice-men, of a good men and a fair &s;tature, appointed to carry orders, and having all of them great &s;ticks in their hands, whereby they put people a&s;ide at a good di&s;tance, and hinder that no body march before the King to incommode him.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Rajas</HI> marcheth a train mixed of a great number of Timbals and Trumpets. I have already &s;aid in another place, that this Train con&s;i&s;ts of nothing but of figures of Silver repre&s;enting &s;trange Animals, Hands, Scales, Fi&s;hes, and other my&s;terious things, that are carried at the end of great Silver-&s;ticks.</P>
<P>At la&s;t a great troup of <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> or little <HI>Omrahs,</HI> well mounted, and furni&s;ht with Swords, Arrows and Quivers, follow after all the former: And this Body is much more numerous than that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> becau&s;e, be&s;ides that all tho&s;e that are of the Guard dare not fail to be at break of day, as the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> at the gate of the Kings Tent to accompany him: There are al&s;o many, that come among&s;t them, to make their Court, and to become known there.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="395">
The Prince&s;&s;es, and the great Ladies of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> are al&s;o carried in &s;undry fa&s;h|ions; &s;ome are carried, like the King, on mens &s;houlders, in a <HI>Tchaudoule,</HI> which is a kind of <HI>Tactravan,</HI> painted, guilded, and cover'd with great and co&s;tly Net-work of Silk of divers colours, enriched with Embroidery, Fringe, and thick pendant tufts. O|thers are carried in a very hand&s;ome <HI>Palekys</HI> clo&s;ed, that are likewi&s;e painted and guil|ded, and covered with that rich &s;ilken net-work. Some are carried in large Litters by two &s;trong Camels, or by two &s;mall Elephants, in&s;tead of Mules: and in this manner I have &s;ometimes &s;een carried <HI>Rauchenara-Begum;</HI> when I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that in the fore-part of her Litter, being open, there was a little She-&s;lave, that with a peacocks|tail kept off from her the Flyes and Du&s;t. La&s;tly, others are carried upon Elephants richly harne&s;&s;ed, and cover'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mbroider'd d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">kings, and great Silver-bells; where the&s;e Ladies &s;it, rai&s;ed, as 'twere, into the middle region of the Air, four and four in <HI>Mik-dembers</HI> latticed, which always are cover'd with &s;ilken Net-work, and are no le&s;s &s;plendid and &s;tately than the <HI>Tchaudoules</HI> and <HI>Tactravans.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot forbear relating here, that in this Voyage I took a particular plea&s;ure in be|holding and con&s;idering this pompous march of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> And certainly nothing more &s;tately can be imagined, than to &s;ee <HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> march fir&s;t, mounted upon a lu&s;ty Elephant of <HI>Pegu</HI> in a <HI>Mik-dember,</HI> all &s;hining of Gold and Azur, attended by five or &s;ix other Elephants with their <HI>Mik-dembers,</HI> almo&s;t as &s;plendid as hers, filled with the principal She-Officers of her Hou&s;e; &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Eunuchs, richly a|dorned, and advantagiou&s;ly mounted, riding on her &s;ide, each with a Cane in his hand; a Troup of <HI>Tartarian</HI> and <HI>Kachemirian</HI> Maids, of Honour about her, odly and fanta&s;tically dre&s;&s;ed, and riding on very pretty Hackney-hor&s;es; and la&s;tly, many other Eunuchs on Hor&s;eback accompanied with &s;tore of Pages and Lackeys, with great &s;ticks in their hands, to make way afar off. After this <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> I &s;aw pa&s;s one of the prin|cipal Ladies of the Court, mounted and attended in proportion: And after this, a third in the &s;ame fa&s;hion; and then another, and &s;o on to fifteen or &s;ixteen all, (more or le&s;s) bravely mounted and accompanied according to their quality, pay, and office. Indeed this long file of Elephants to the number of fifty, or more, thus gravely marching with paces, as 'twere, counted, and withal this gallant train and equipage, does repre&s;ent &s;omething that is Great and Royal; and if I had not beheld this Pomp with a kind of philo&s;ophical indifference, I know not, whether I &s;hould not have &s;uffer|ed my &s;elf to be carried away to tho&s;e extravagant &s;entiments of mo&s;t of the <HI>Indian</HI> Po|ets, who will have it, that all the&s;e Elephants carry as many hidden Godde&s;&s;es. 'Tis true, one can hardly &s;ee them, and they are almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by men; it would be a great misfortune to any poor Cavalier who&s;oever, to be found in the Field too near them in the march; all tho&s;e Eunuchs, and all the crue of Servants are to the highe&s;t degree in&s;olent, and de&s;ire nothing more than &s;uch apretext and occa&s;ion to fall upon a man and give him &s;ome Ba&s;tinadoes. I remember, I was once thus unfortunately &s;urprized, and certainly I had been very ill u&s;ed, as well as many other Cavaliers, if at length I had not re&s;olved to make my way out by my &s;word, rather than &s;uffer my &s;elf to be thus maim|ed as they began to order the matter; and if by good luck I had not been provided with a good Hor&s;e, that carried me vigoron&s;ly out of the pre&s;s, when I put him on thorow a torrent of people, that was to be repa&s;&s;ed. And it is grown in a manner a common Proverb of the&s;e Armies, That, above all, one mu&s;t beware of three things: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Not to let one &s;elf to be engaged among&s;t the troups of the cho&s;en led Hor&s;e, they ne|ver failing to &s;trike: <HI>Secondly,</HI> not to come into the places of Hunting: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> not to approach too near the Women of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding by what I hear, it is much le&s;s dangerous here than in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for there 'tis death to be found in the field in &s;ight of the Eunuchs that attend them, though you were half a league di&s;tant from them. It is required, that as many men as there are in the Villages and Burroughs, where they pa&s;s, do all abandon them and retire afar off.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Hunting</HI> of the King, I knew not fir&s;t how to imagine what is commonly &s;aid, which is, that the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> goes to hunt with an hundred thou&s;and men: But now I feel, it may very well be &s;aid, that he goes to hunt with above two hundred thou&s;and, nor is it a thing hard to comprehend. In the neighbouring places to <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> along the river <HI>Gemma</HI> as far as to the mountains, and even on both &s;ides of the high way to <HI>Lahor,</HI> there is abundance of untilled Lands, &s;ome of Cop&s;e-wood, and &s;ome of Gra&s;s above a mans height: In all the&s;e places there are great numbers of Guards, unce&s;&s;antly roving up and down, and hindering all other people from huntin
<PB N="121" REF="395">
except Partridges, Quailes and Hares, which the Indians know to take with nets: So that every where in tho&s;e places there is very great &s;tore of all kind of Game. This being &s;o, the hunting guards, when they know that the King is in the field, and near their quarters, give notice, to the Great Hunting-ma&s;ter, of the quality of the Game, and of the place where mo&s;t of it is: then the Guards do line all the avenues of that quarter, and that &s;ometimes for above four or five Leagues of ground, that &s;o the <HI>whole Army</HI> may pa&s;s by, either this or that way, and the King being in his march may at the &s;ame time enter into it with as many <HI>Omrabs,</HI> Hunters and other per&s;ons as he &s;hall plea&s;e, and there hunt at his ea&s;e, now in one manner and then in another, according to the difference of the Game. And now behold fir&s;t, how he hunteth the <HI>Gazelles</HI> or wild Fawns with tamed <HI>Leopards.</HI></P>
<P>I think, I have el&s;e where told you, that in the <HI>Indies</HI> there is &s;tore of <HI>Gazelles,</HI> that are in a manner &s;haped as our Hinds or Fawns; that the&s;e <HI>Gazelles</HI> commonly go in &s;everal troups, and that every troup, which never con&s;i&s;ts of above five or &s;ix, is alwaies follow'd by one only male, di&s;cernable by the colour. One of &s;uch troups being di&s;|cover'd, they endeavour to make the Leopard &s;ee them, who is held chain'd upon a little chariot. This crafty animal doth not pre&s;ently and directly run after them, but goes winding and turning, &s;topping and hiding him&s;elf, &s;o to approach them with more ad|vantage, and to &s;urprize them: And as he is capable to make five or &s;ix leaps with an almo&s;t incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, when he finds he is within reach, he lanceth him&s;elf upon them, worrieth them, and gluts him&s;elf with their blood, heart and liver: If he fail|eth (which often happens) he &s;tands &s;till, and it would be in vain for him to attempt to take them by running after them, becau&s;e they run much fa&s;ter, and hold out longer than he. Then the Ma&s;ter comes gently about him, flattering him, and throwing him &s;ome pieces of fle&s;h, and thus amu&s;ing him, puts &s;omething over his eyes to cover them, and &s;o chains him, and puts him upon the chariot again. One of the&s;e Leopards gave us once in our march this diverti&s;ement, which frighted &s;tore of people. A troup of <HI>Gazelles</HI> appear'd in the mid&s;t of the Army, as they will do every day; it chanced that they pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to two Leopards that were carried. as they u&s;e to be, upon their little chariot. One of them not blinded, made &s;uch an effort that he bur&s;t his chain, and darted him&s;elf after them, but without catching any of them: Yet the <HI>Gazelles,</HI> not knowing which way to e&s;cape, being pur&s;ued, cried after, and hunted on every &s;ide, there was one of them that was forced to repa&s;s again near the Leopard, who, notwith&s;tanding the Camels and Hor&s;es that pe&s;tred all the way, and contrary to what is commonly &s;aid of this Bea&s;t, that it never returns to its prey when it hath once failed of it, flew upon it and caught it.</P>
<P>The hunting of the <HI>Nilgaux</HI> or gray Oxen, which I &s;aid were a kind of Elcks, hath no great matter in it. They are inclo&s;ed in great Nets, that are by little and little drawn clo&s;er together, and when they are reduced to a &s;mall compa&s;s of enclo&s;ure, the King, the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and the Hunters do enter and kill them at plea&s;ure with Arrows, Half-pikes, Sables or Mu&s;quets; and &s;ometimes in &s;o great numbers, that the King &s;ends quarters of them for pre&s;ents to all the <HI>Omrabs.</HI></P>
<P>The Game of the <HI>Cranes</HI> hath &s;omething of diverti&s;ement. 'Tis a plea&s;ure to &s;ee them defend them&s;elves in the Air again&s;t the Birds of prey; they &s;ometimes kill &s;ome of them; but at length, not being nimble in turning, many &s;trong Birds ma&s;ter them.</P>
<P>Of all the Games that of the <HI>Lion</HI> is the mo&s;t Royal, becau&s;e there is none but the King and the Princes that can exerci&s;e it (unle&s;s it be by a very particular leave;) but it is al&s;o the mo&s;t dangerous. The manner of it is this. When the King is in the field, and the Hunting-guards have di&s;cover'd the place of the Lions retirement; they tye fa&s;t an A&s;s there-about, which the Lion &s;oon comes to devour, and without caring to look out for other prey, as Oxen, Cows, Mutton or Shepherds, he goes to &s;eek for drink, and returns to his ordinary lodging place, where he lyes down and &s;leeps until next morning, when he finds another A&s;s in the &s;elf-&s;ame place, which the Hunters have fa&s;tned there as the day before; and when they have thus baited and amu&s;ed him &s;everal dayes in the &s;ame place, and now that the King is nigh, they at length tye fa&s;t another A&s;s, but whom they have made to &s;wallow a quantity of <HI>opium,</HI> to the end that his fle&s;h may the better lull a&s;leep the Lion, and then all the Country-men of the circumjacent Villages &s;pread large and &s;trong nets made for that purpo&s;e, which they al&s;o by degrees reduce to a &s;mall compa&s;s, as is practi&s;ed in the hunting of the <HI>Nilgaux.</HI> All things thus prepar'd, the King mounted on an Elephant trap'd with
<PB N="122" REF="396">
iron, being attended by the great Hunting-ma&s;ter, &s;ome <HI>Omrahs</HI> riding al&s;o on Ele|phants, by abundance of <HI>Gourze-berdars</HI> on Hor&s;e-back, and by a numerous Hunting-guard on foot, arm'd with Half-pikes, approacheth to the Nets from without, and with a great Mu&s;quet &s;hoots at the Lion; who when he finds him&s;elf wounded, comes directly to the Elephant, as his cu&s;tom is; but he meets with tho&s;e big Nets &s;topping him, and the King &s;hoots &s;o often at him, that at la&s;t he kills him. Yet in this la&s;t hunting there was a Lion that leapt over the&s;e Nets, fell upon an Hor&s;eman who&s;e Hor&s;e he kill'd, and then ran away: But the Hunters met with him, and inclo&s;ed him again in the Net, which cau&s;ed a great di&s;turbance to the Army; we were three or four dayes padling in &s;mall torrents running down the mountains, betwixt under|wood and &s;uch long gra&s;s as that Camels hardly can be &s;een therein; and happy were the&s;e that had &s;ome provi&s;ion of victuals; for all was in di&s;order: The <HI>Bazars</HI> could not range them&s;elves, and the Villages were remote. The rea&s;on why we were to &s;top there &s;o long, was, that as it is a good <HI>Omen</HI> with the Indians when the King kills a Lion, &s;o it is a very ill one, when he faileth, and they think that the State would run great hazard if they &s;hould not ma&s;ter him. Hence 'tis al&s;o that they make many Ceremonies upon the account of this Hunting; for they bring the dead Lion before the King in the general A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and after he hath been well viewed and exactly mea&s;ur'd, 'its recorded in the Archives, that &s;uch a King, at &s;uch a time, &s;lew a Lion of &s;uch a bigne&s;s, of &s;uch hair, of &s;o long and large teeth and claws, not omitting the lea&s;t circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here only add a word in reference to what is commonly &s;aid of the <HI>Opium,</HI> that the A&s;s is made to &s;wallow, <HI>viz.</HI> That one of the chief Hunters a&s;&s;ur'd me, that it was but a tale of the vulgar, and that the Lion &s;lept &s;ufficiently without it, when he had his belly full.</P>
<P>Now to return to our march; when the great Rivers, which in the&s;e quarters com|monly have no Bridges, are to be pa&s;&s;ed, there are made two Boat-Bridges, about two or three hundred paces di&s;tant from one another; which they know well enough how to chain and fa&s;ten together. Upon them they ca&s;t earth and &s;traw mingled together, which preventeth the &s;liding of the animals. The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing upon, and the coming from it are only dangerous, becau&s;e, that be&s;ides the great croud, which then common|ly throngeth, and the great confu&s;ion and embara&s;ment, it often happens that pits or holes are made when 'tis moving earth; and then you &s;hall have Hor&s;es and burthen'd Oxen tumble upon one another, over whom people do pa&s;s with an incredible di&s;ord|er; which would be yet greater, if all were to pa&s;s in <HI>one</HI> day: But ordinarily the King encampeth but half a League from the Bridge, where he &s;tays a day or two, and he ne|ver almo&s;t encampeth farther than half a League from the River on the other &s;ide of the Bridge, that &s;o the Army may have at lea&s;t three days and three nights to pa&s;s more conveniently,</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as to the number of people that is found in the Army, it is not &s;o ea&s;ie a thing to determine it. It is &s;o differently &s;poken of, that one knows not what to Judge of it. What I can tell you of it in the general, that is mo&s;t probable, is this: That in this march there were at lea&s;t, as to Souldiers and others, an hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e|men, and above an hundred and fifty thou&s;and Animals, as Hor&s;es, Mules or Elephants; that there were near fifty thou&s;and Camels, and almo&s;t as many Oxen or A&s;&s;es, that &s;erve to carry the grain, and other provi&s;ions of the&s;e poor people of the <HI>Bazars,</HI> their wives and children: For they lugg all with them, as our <HI>Bohcmians</HI> do. Upon this mea&s;ure you may reckon pretty near the number of the &s;erving people, &s;uppo&s;ing that nothing is there done but by the force of &s;ervants, and that I, who am but in the rank of a Cavalier of two Hor&s;es, can hardly do my bu&s;ine&s;s with le&s;s than three men: Some &s;ay, that in the whole Army, there is &s;carce le&s;s than between three or four hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons. Others reckon more; others le&s;s. No body ever told them to de|termine the preci&s;e number. I can &s;ay nothing of certainty, but only that 'tis a pro|digious and almo&s;t incredible number; but then you are to imagine, that 'tis all <HI>Dehli,</HI> the Capital City, that marcheth, becau&s;e that all the Inhabitans of that Town, living upon the Court and the Army, are obliged to follow them, e&s;pecially when the voyage is to be long, as this; or el&s;e they mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P>The difficulty is to know, whence and how &s;o great an Army can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the Field, &s;o va&s;t a number of people and bea&s;ts. For that, we mu&s;t only &s;uppo&s;e (which is ve|ry true) that the <HI>Indians</HI> live very &s;oberly, and ob&s;erve a very &s;imple diet, and that of all
<PB N="123" REF="396">
this great number of Cavaliers there is not the tenth, or not the twentieth man, that in his march eats fle&s;h: provided they have their <HI>Kichery,</HI> that is, their mixture of Rice and of other legums, upon which they pour butter when they are boyled, they are content. We are al&s;o to know, that Camels endure labour, hunger and thir&s;t ex|treamly well, live upon a little, and eat almo&s;t any thing, and that a&s;&s;oon as the Army encampeth any where, the Camel-drivers let them to into the field to brouze, where they eat whatever they light upon. Be&s;ides, that the Merchants that entertain <HI>Bazars</HI> in <HI>Dehli,</HI> are obliged to entertain them in the field: and that all the &s;mall Merchants, that keep &s;hop in the <HI>Bazars</HI> of <HI>Dehli,</HI> keep them al&s;o in the Army, either by force, or out of nece&s;&s;ity, and la&s;tly, that as to Forage, all the&s;e poor people go roving up and down every where in the Village, to buy what they can get, and to gain &s;omething by it; and their great and common refuge is, with a kind of Trowel to ra&s;pe or knock down whole fields, to beat and wa&s;h what they have there gotten, and &s;o to carry it to &s;ell to the Army, which they do &s;ometimes very dear and &s;ometimes very Cheap; I forgot to mention one thing that's remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> that the King enters into the Camp, now on one &s;ide, then on another; and that to day he pa&s;&s;eth near the Tents of certain <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and tomorrow near tho&s;e of others. Which he doth not without de&s;ign; for the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> which he pa&s;&s;eth by &s;o near, are obliged to meet him, and to make him &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ent or other; &s;o that &s;ome will pre&s;ent him with twenty Roupies of Gold, which maketh thirty Pi&s;tols; others with fifty, and &s;o others in proportion, according to their genero&s;ity, and the greatne&s;s of their pay.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, you will excu&s;e me, that I do not ob&s;erve to you the Towns and Bur|roughs that are between <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Lahor;</HI> I have &s;een in a manner none of them, for I went almo&s;t always cro&s;s the fields, and in the night, becau&s;e my <HI>Agah</HI> was not placed in the middle of the Army, where often is the high way, but very forward in the right Wing. We went as well as we could by Star-light cro&s;s the fields to gain the right Wing of the Camp, without &s;eeking for the high way; though &s;ometimes we found our &s;elves much perplexed, and in lieu of three of four Leagues, which is the ordinary di&s;tance of one encampment from one another, we &s;ometimes made five or &s;ix; but when the day comes on, we &s;oon found our &s;elves where we &s;hould be.</P>

<P>IT is not without rea&s;on, that this Kingdom, of which <HI>Lahor</HI> is the Capital City, is called <HI>Penjeab,</HI> or the <HI>Country</HI> of the <HI>Five Waters,</HI> becau&s;e there are actually Five con&s;iderable Rivers coming down from tho&s;e Mountains, within which the Kingdom <HI>Kachemire</HI> is lock'd up, and that run cro&s;s this tract of Land to fall into the River <HI>Indus,</HI> di&s;charging them&s;elves together into the Ocean at <HI>Scymdi,</HI> towards the entry of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph. Whether <HI>Lahor</HI> be that ancient <HI>Bucephalos,</HI> I decide not. Mean time, <HI>Alexinder</HI> is &s;ufficiently known here under the name of <HI>Sekan-der Filifous,</HI> that is, <HI>Alexander</HI> Son of <HI>Philip;</HI> but as to his Hor&s;e, they know it not. The City of <HI>Lahor</HI> is built upon one of the&s;e Five Rivers, which is not le&s;s than our River <HI>Loire,</HI> and for which there is great need of a like bank, becau&s;e it maketh great deva&s;tation, and often changeth its bed, and hath but lately retired it &s;elf from <HI>Lahor</HI> for a quarter of a League; which very much incommodeth the Inhabitants. The Hou&s;es of <HI>Lahor</HI> have this peculiar above tho&s;e of <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Agra;</HI> that they are very high, but mo&s;t of them are ruinous, becau&s;e 'tis now more then twenty years that the Court is alwayes at <HI>Dehli</HI> or at <HI>Agra,</HI> and that in the&s;e later years the rains have been &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that they have overthrown many of them, whereby al&s;o much people hath been killed. 'Tis true, there remain &s;till five or &s;ix con&s;iderable Streets, of which there are two or three that are above a League long; but in them al&s;o are many buildings found that fall down. The Kings Palace is no longer upon the River &s;ide, as it was formerly, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="124" REF="397">
that the River hath left it. It is very high, and magnificent; yet tho&s;e of <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli</HI> do much &s;urpa&s;s it. It is now above two months that we are here, expect|ing the melting of the Snow of the mountains of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> for a more convenient pa&s;&s;age into that Kingdom. But at length we are to depart tomorrow. The King hath been gone the&s;e two dayes. I have got a little <HI>Kachemirian</HI> Tent, which I bought ye&s;terday. I was advi&s;ed to do like others, and to leave here my ordinary Tent, which is big and heavy enough, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, that between the mountains of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> whither we are now marching, it will be difficult to find room enough, and that the Camels not having place enough to pa&s;s, we &s;hall be obliged to get our Baggage carried by Porters, and that &s;o my large Tent would co&s;t me much to carry.</P>

<P>I Believed, that after we had overcome the heats of <HI>Maok,</HI> near <HI>Babel-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">del,</HI> I could defie tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the Earth, but &s;ince the&s;e four dayes that the Army left <HI>Lahor,</HI> I find I come very &s;hort of my reckoning, and I have experimented to the hazard of my life, that it is not without rea&s;on, that the Indians them&s;elves did appre|hend the eleven or twelve dayes march of the Army, from <HI>Lahor</HI> to <HI>Bamber,</HI> the entry of the mountains of <HI>Kachemire.</HI> I prote&s;t unto you, without any exaggaration, that the heats have been &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that &s;ometimes they have reduced me to extremity, in&s;omuch that I knew not in the morning whether I &s;hould live till night. The cau&s;e of this extraordinary heat is, that the high mountains of <HI>Kachemire</HI> being on the <HI>North</HI> of our road, keep from us all the cool wind that might come and refre&s;h us from that Quarter, and do reflect the &s;un-beams upon us, and leave the field burnt up and choa|king.

<P>WE are at length arriv'd at <HI>Bember,</HI> the foot of a &s;teep, black, and burn'd Moun|tam, and we are encamped in the channel of a large Torrent dried up, full of &s;and and &s;tones burning hot; It is like an hot Oven: And if it were not for the &s;how|er of Rain, we had this morning, and for the curled Milk, the Limons, and the Fowl brought to us from the mountains, I know not what would have become of me, and you would perhaps never have &s;een this Letter.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hi&s;tories of the Ancient Kings of <HI>Kachemire</HI> tell us, that all that Countrey was formerly nothing but a great Lake; and that there was an old Holy man, call|ed <HI>Kacheb,</HI> that gave an outlet to the Waters by a Miraculous Cut he made in the Moun|tain of <HI>Baramoule.</HI> This may be &s;een in the Abridgment of the&s;e Hi&s;tories, which <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> cau&s;ed to be made, and which I am tran&s;lating out of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue. For my part, I would not deny, all this Land to have once been cover'd with Water; the like is affirmed of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and &s;ome other Countries; but 'tis hard to believe, that this opening is the work of one man, becau&s;e the Mountain is very big and very high. I &s;hould rather think, that &s;ome great Earthquake (tho&s;e parts being &s;ubject enough to them) had open'd &s;ome Cavern under ground, which the Mountain did &s;ink into, after the &s;ame manner as the opening of <HI>Babel-Mandel</HI> is made (if it be true what the <HI>Arabians</HI> of that Countrey &s;ay of it) and as whole Towns and Mountains have been &s;een to be &s;wallow'd up in great Lakes.</P>
<P>However it be, <HI>Kachemire</HI> is no Lake now, but a very fair Campagne, diver&s;ified by many little Hillocks, about 30 Leagues long, and 10, or 12 Leagues broad; &s;ituated in the extream of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> North of <HI>Lahor,</HI> lock'd up within the Mountains of <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> between tho&s;e of the Kings of the great <HI>Tibet,</HI> the little <HI>Tibet,</HI> and the Raja <HI>Gamon,</HI> its next Neighbours.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Mountains &s;urrounding it, I mean tho&s;e that are next to the Plain, are of a middle height, all green with Trees or Pa&s;ture, full of all &s;orts of Cattel, as Cows,
<PB N="127" REF="398">
Sheep, Goats, Hor&s;es; and of Game of divers kinds, as Partridges, Hares, Gazelles, and of &s;ome Animals yielding Musk. There are al&s;o abundance of Bees; and (which is rare in the <HI>Indies)</HI> there are found no Serpents, Tigers, Bears, Lions, but very &s;el|dom. So that it may be &s;aid, that the&s;e are not only very innocent Mountains, but flowing with Milk and Honey, as were tho&s;e of the Land of Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Beyond tho&s;e middle-&s;iz'd Mountains, there ri&s;e others, very high ones, the top of which are alwayes cover'd with Snow, and appear above the ordinary Clouds and Mi&s;ts, alwayes calm and clear as well as Mount <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>
<P>Out of all the&s;e Mountains do i&s;&s;ue innumerable Sources and Rivulets on all &s;ides, which the Inhabitants know how to convey to their <HI>Rice</HI>-fields, and even through rai&s;ed Ground unto their little Hillocks; and which, after they have made a thou&s;and other little Rivulets, and a thou&s;and <HI>Ca&s;cata's</HI> every where, come at la&s;t to meet, and to make a very fair River, that carrieth Boats as big as our River of <HI>Seine,</HI> and after it hath gently turn'd about the Kingdom, and pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of the Capital City, finds its out-let at <HI>Baramoule</HI> between two &s;teep Rocks, and having afterwards taken in many &s;mall Rivers that come down from the Mountains, falls about <HI>Atex</HI> into the River <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e Rivulets de&s;cending from the Mountains, make the Plain and all tho&s;e Hillocks &s;o fair and fruitful, that one would take this whole Kingdom for &s;ome great <HI>Ever-green</HI> Garden, intermixed with Villages and Burroughs, di&s;covering them&s;elves between Trees, and diver&s;ified by Meadows, Fields of Rice, Corn, and divers other Legumes, of Hemp, and Saffron; all interlaced with Ditches full of Water, with Channels, with &s;mall Lakes and Rivulets here and there. Up and down every where are al&s;o &s;een &s;ome of our <HI>European</HI> Plants, Flowers, and all &s;orts of our Trees, as Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricots, Nuts, Vines. The particular Gardens are full of Melons, Water|melons, Skirrets, Beets, Radi&s;hes, all &s;orts of <HI>our</HI> Pot-herbs, and of &s;ome we have not.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are not &s;o many &s;orts of Fruit as with us, nor are they &s;o excellent as ours; but I believe that that is not the fault of the Soil, but that, if they had as good Gardeners as we, knowing to cultivate and graft Trees, to chu&s;e proper places and proper Stocks, and to &s;end for Grafts from Forreign Countries, they would have as many and as good as we; becau&s;e among that number of divers &s;orts, which I often cau&s;ed to be brought to me, I have frequently met with very excellent ones.</P>
<P>The Capital City, which is of the &s;ame name with that of the Kingdom, is with|out walls; 'tis three quarters of a League long, and half a League broad; &s;cituate in a Plain, about two Leagues di&s;tant from Mountains, which &s;eem to make as 'twere a Semi-Circle; and &s;tanding upon a Lake of &s;weet Water of four or five miles in com|pa&s;s, which is made up of Live-Springs, and of Rivulets running down the Moun|tains, and di&s;gorgeth it &s;elf by a Navigable Channel into the River which pa&s;&s;eth through the mid&s;t of the Town. This River hath in the Town two wooden Bridges over it for communication. Mo&s;t Hou&s;es are of Wood, but well built, and of two or three Stories high; not as if they had not very good Free Stone there (many old Idol-Temples ruined, and other Buildings made of it, being yet to be &s;een;) but the abundance of Wood, ea&s;ily de&s;cending from the mountains by little Rivers, which it is ca&s;t into, maketh people find that way of Building turn to better account. The Hou&s;es that &s;tand upon the River have almo&s;t all of them their little Garden, lying upon the Water; which maketh a very plea&s;ant Per&s;pective, e&s;pecially in the Spring and Sum|mer, when men walk on the River-&s;ide. The other Hou&s;es that &s;tand not upon the River, have al&s;o almo&s;t all of them &s;ome Garden; and there are a good number of &s;uch, that have a Channel an&s;wering to the Lake, and a little Boat to go and divert them&s;elves upon it.</P>
<P>In one end of the Town there appears an Hill, loo&s;e from all the re&s;t, which maketh another very agreeable Per&s;pective, becau&s;e on its Declivity there &s;tand very fine Hou&s;es with Gardens, and on the top a Mo&s;quee and an Heremitage well built with a Garden, and &s;tore of fine green Trees: And 'tis upon the account of the&s;e Trees and Gardens, that in the Language of the Country 'tis called <HI>Haryperbet,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, the Mountain of Verdure.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Hill there is &s;een another, on which there is al&s;o a Mo&s;quee, but a little one, together with a Garden, and a very ancient Building, which &s;eems to have been a Temple of Idols, though they call it <HI>Tact Souliman,</HI> that is, the Throne of <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>Soloman,</HI> as the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> &s;ay, cau&s;ed it to be built when he came to

<P>Beyond the Lake, upon the &s;ide of the Hills, there is nothing but Hou&s;es and Gardens of plea&s;ure, the place having been found wonderfully proper for it, as being in a very fine Air, in the view of the Lake, the I&s;les, and the Town, and full of Springs and Rivulets.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t admirable of all the&s;e Gardens is that of the King, which is called <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|limar.</HI> From the Lake, one enters into it by a great Canal, border'd with great green Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s. This Canal is above five hundred common paces long, and runs 'twixt two large All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s of Poplars: It leadeth to a great Cabinet in the mid&s;t of the Garden, where begins another Canal far more magnificent, which runs with a little ri&s;ing unto the end of the Garden. This Canal is paved with large Free-Stone; its &s;loping &s;ide cover'd with the &s;ame; and in the mid&s;t of it, there is a long Row of Jets of Water, from 15 to 15 foot. There are al&s;o, from &s;pace to &s;pace, great Rounds of Water &s;erving for Store|hou&s;es, whence many Jets of Water, variou&s;ly figured, do &s;pring up: And this Canal ends at another great Cabinet, which is almo&s;t like the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cabinets, which are in a manner made like <HI>Domes,</HI> &s;cituate in the middle of the Canal, and encompa&s;&s;ed with Water, and con&s;equently between tho&s;e two great Allees of Poplars, have a Gallery that reigneth round about, and four Gates oppo&s;ite to one another; two of which do re&s;pect the Allees, with two Bridges to pa&s;s over, one on one &s;ide, and the other on the other; the other two look upon the oppo&s;ite Canals.

But what is peculiar and con&s;iderable in them, and which draws the Trade and Silver into their Countrey, is that prodigious quantity of Stuffs call'd <HI>Chales,</HI> which they work there, and employ their little Childeren in. The&s;e <HI>Chales</HI> are certain kinds of Stuff an Ell and a half long, and about an Ell broad, which are embroidered at each end with a kind of Embroidery about a Foot large.

Concerning therefore fir&s;t our Voyage from <HI>Bember</HI> hither, it &s;eem'd to me &s;urpri&s;ing enough, to find my &s;elf from the fir&s;t night that we&punc; parted from <HI>Bember&punc;</HI> and entred into the Mountains&punc; pa&s;s from a To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d to a Temperate Zone: For, we had&punc; no &s;ooner mounted this dreadful Wall of the World, I mean, this&punc; high, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eep, black&punc;and bald Mountain, of <HI>Bember&punc;</HI> but that in de&s;cending on the other&punc; &s;ide, we found an Air that was pretty tollerable, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, gentle and temperate. But that which &s;urpri&s;ed me more in the&s;e Mountains, was, to find my &s;elf, in a trice, tran&s;ported out of the <HI>Indies</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> For, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing the Earth covered with all our plants and &s;hrubs, exept I&s;&s;op, Thyme, Marjoram and Ro&s;emary, I imagined I was in &s;ome of our Mountains of <HI>Auvergne,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a Fore&s;t of all our kinds of Trees, Pines, Oaks, Elms, Plane-trees. And I was the more a&s;toni&s;h'd becau&s;e in all tho&s;e burning Fields of <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI> whence I came&punc; I had &s;een almo&s;t nothing of all that.</P>
<P>Among other things relating to Plants, this &s;urpri&s;ed me, that one and a half days journy from <HI>Bember</HI> I found a Mountain, that was cover'd with them on both &s;ides, but with this difference, that on the &s;ide of the Mountain that was Southerly, toward the <HI>Indies,</HI> there was a mixture of <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> Plants, and on that which was ex|po&s;ed to the North I ob&s;erv'd none but <HI>European</HI> ones; as if the former had participated of the Air and temper of <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the other had been mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly <HI>European.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Trees, I admired this natural cour&s;e of Generations and Corruptions: Below in the&s;e bottoms, where perhaps&punc; no man ever was, I &s;aw hundreds that were falling, or fallen, one&punc; upon another, dead and half rotten of age; and other young and verdant ones growing out of the foot of tho&s;e that were dead: Some of them al&s;o I &s;aw burnt, whether it&punc; was from Lightning, or that in the heat of Summer they had taken fire by rubbing them&s;elves again&s;t one another, when they were agitated by &s;ome hot and impetuous wind; or, as the Country-people &s;ay, that they&punc;take fire of them|&s;elves, when they are grown old and dry.</P>
<P>I admired al&s;o tho&s;e natural <HI>Ca&s;cata's</HI> of water, which we found between tho&s;e Rocks. We met, among others, one of them &s;o wonderful, that doubtle&s;s, it can|not be parallel'd. One &s;eeth a far off from the &s;ide of an high Mountain, running down a Torrent of water in a Channel cover'd with Trees, and precipitate it &s;elf in a trice to the bottom of a &s;teep-Rock of a &s;tupendious height, with a noi&s;e that is able to &s;trike one deaf, like a <HI>Cataract.</HI> There was erected near it, a Theatre, upon a Rock, which <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an-Guire</HI> had cau&s;ed purpo&s;ely to be made plain, that the Court pa&s;&s;|ing, might there repo&s;e them&s;elves, and from thence with conveniency behold this ad|mirable Work-man-&s;hip of Nature; which as well as tho&s;e old Trees, I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of, &s;eems to re&s;emble &s;omething of great Antiquity, and of the fir&s;t produ|ction of the World.</P>
<P>All the&s;e diverti&s;ements were blended with an odd accident. On the day, that the King went up the Mountain of <HI>Pire-penjale,</HI> which is the highe&s;t of all, and whence one begins to di&s;cover a far off the Country of <HI>Kachemire;</HI> on that day, I &s;ay, that the King a&s;cended this Mountain, being followed by a long row of Elephants, upon which &s;ate the Women in <HI>Mikdembers,</HI> and <HI>Embarys;</HI> one of tho&s;e Elephants was frighted by beholding, as the <HI>Indians</HI> would have it, &s;uch a long and &s;teep a&s;cent, and fell back upon him that was next, and he upon the next, and &s;o on to the fifteenth, &s;o that not one of them being able&punc; to turn in this way, which was extreamly rude and &s;teep, they all tumbled into the precipice. It was good fortune for tho&s;e poor Women, that the precipice it &s;elf was not very &s;teep&punc; &s;o that there were but three or four of them kill'd; but the fifteen Elephants remai'nd upon the place. When the&s;e bulky Ma&s;&s;es do once fall under tho&s;e va&s;t burthens they are loaden with, they never ri&s;e again, though the way be never &s;o fair. We &s;aw them two days after, in pa&s;&s;ing by, and I ob&s;erved &s;ome of them yet &s;tirring their Trunk. This accident put the whole Army, which had mar|ched four days along the Mountains in file, into great di&s;order, becau&s;e to recover the&s;e Women and all that wreck, a &s;top was made for the remainder of that day and all the night, every one being nece&s;&s;itated to &s;top where he was, becau&s;e it was in many places impo&s;&s;ible to advance or go back, and none had near him tho&s;e Porters that carried his Tent and Victuals. As for my &s;elf, I was not in the wor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> condition, having found means to creep out of the way, and to take the conveniency of a &s;mall place to lye down i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; for my &s;elf and my Hor&s;e. And, to my good luck, one of my &s;ervants that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ol|low'd me, had a little bread, which we &s;hared together. I remember, it was&punc; there

<P>In traver&s;ing this &s;ame Mountain of <HI>Pire-penjale,</HI> where the Elephants tumbled down, there occurr'd, tho&s;e things which call'd to my mind &s;ome of my former philo&s;ophical thoughts. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was, that in le&s;s than an hour we felt <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Winter;</HI> for in a&s;cending we did &s;weat gro&s;s drops, all men going on foot in a burning Sun; and when we came to the top of the Mountain, we yet found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cy Snow, that had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to open the way; there was a Fro&s;t upon a mi&s;ling Rain, and there blew a wind &s;o cold&punc; that all people &s;hook and run away, e&s;pecially the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">illy <HI>Indians,</HI> who never had &s;een Ice or Snow, nor felt &s;uch a cold.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> was, that in le&s;s than two hundred paces I met with two quite contrary winds; one from the North, which blew in my face a&s;cending, e&s;pecially when I came near the top, and another from the South, which blew again&s;t my back in de|&s;cending; as if this Hill had protruded exhalations out of its bowels from all &s;ides, which coming forth had cau&s;ed, a wind that had de&s;cended and taken its cour&s;e in tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite dales.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> was the meeting an old Hermit, that had lived on the top of this Moun|tain &s;ince the time of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> and who&s;e Religion was not known; though it was &s;aid, that he did miracles, cau&s;ed &s;trange thunders when he would, and rai&s;ed &s;torms of Hail, Snow, Rain and Wind. He look'd &s;omewhat &s;avage-like, having a long and large white Beard uncombed. He asked alms &s;omewhat fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rcely; &s;uffer'd us to take up water in earthen cups, he had ranged upon a great &s;tone; made &s;igne with his hand, importing that we &s;hould &s;peedily march away, and grumbled at tho&s;e that made a noi&s;e, becau&s;e&punc; &s;aid he to me, (when I was come into his Cave, and had a little &s;weetned his looks with half a Roupy, which with much humility I put into his hand) a noi&s;e rai&s;eth furious &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orms and tempe&s;ts. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> &s;aid he further, did very well in following my coun&s;el, and not permitting to make a noi&s;e: <HI>Chah-Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> al|ways took care of the &s;ame; but <HI>Jehan Guire</HI> once mocking at it, and cau&s;ing Trum|pets and Cymbals to &s;ound, was like to have peri&s;hed here.</P>
<P>In reference to the little Voyages I have made in divers parts of this Kingdom, behold the particulars I took notice of as I pa&s;&s;ed. We were no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Kachemire,</HI> but my <HI>Navah Danech-mend-kan</HI> &s;ent me, together with one of his Hor&s;e-men for a Con|voy, and a Country-man, to one of the extremities of this Kingdom, three &s;mall days journey from hence, upon the relation made him, that this was the very time to &s;ee the Wonders (for &s;o they &s;peak of them) of a Spring that is thereabout. The&s;e Wonders are, that in the month of <HI>May,</HI> the time when the Snow begins but to melt, this Fountain, for about the &s;pace of fifteen days, regularly flows and &s;tops thrice a day, at break of day, at noon and at night: Its flowing ordinarily la&s;ts three quarters of an hour, more or le&s;s, and that plentifully enough, to fill a &s;quare receptacle, having &s;teps to go down to it, and being about ten or twelve foot broad, and as many foot deep. After the fir&s;t fifteen days, its cour&s;e begins to be le&s;s regular and le&s;s copious; and at length, after a month or thereabout, it quite &s;tops and runs no more for the re&s;t of the year, unle&s;s it be, that during &s;ome plentiful and long rains, it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ws ince&s;|&s;antly and without Rule, as other Fountains do. The <HI>Gentiles</HI> have on the &s;ide of the Receiver a little Temple of the Idol of <HI>Brare,</HI> which is one of their fal&s;e Deities; and thence it is that they call this Fountain <HI>Send-Brary,</HI> as as if you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>&punc;Water of Brare;</HI> and that thither they come from all parts in pil|grimage, to bathe and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anctifie them&s;elves in this miraculous water. Upon the origin of this Water they make many fables, which I &s;hall not recite to you, becau&s;e I find not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of truth in them. During the five or &s;ix days of my &s;tay there, I did what po&s;&s;ible I could to find the rea&s;on of this Wonder. I did attentively con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the Mountain, at the foot of which this Spring is found: I went to the very top with great pains, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arching and prying every where. I ob&s;erved that it ex|tends it &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in length from North to South; that 'tis &s;ever'd from other Mountains, which yet are very near to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; that it is in the form of an A&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s back; that its top, which is very long, hath not much more than an hundred paces where it is large&s;t; that one
<PB N="132" REF="401">
of the &s;ide of the Mountain, which is cover'd with nothing but green gra&s;s, is expo|&s;ed to the Ea&s;t, yet &s;o that the Sun comes not to &s;hine on't before eight a clock in the morning, becau&s;e of the other oppo&s;ite Mountains; and la&s;tly, that the other &s;ide, which is expos'd to the We&s;t, is covered with Trees and Bu&s;hes. All this being con&s;idered, I did imagine, that the heat of the Sun, together with the particular &s;ituation and the in|ternal di&s;po&s;ition of the Mountain, might very well be the cau&s;e of this pretended Miracle, that the Mountain, Sun, coming briskly to &s;trike on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite thereto, heats it, and melts part of the frozen waters, which during the Winter, when all was covered with Snow, had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the inner parts of the earth of this Mountain; that the&s;e waters penetrating, and by little and little running down unto certain beds of quick rock, which retain and convey them toward the Spring-head, cau&s;e the flowing of the Fountain at Noon; That the &s;ame Sun, rai&s;ed to the South, and leaving that other &s;ide, now growing cold, for to &s;trike with its beams as 'twere perpendicularly, the top, doth al&s;o melt other frozen waters, which likewi&s;e run down by little and little as the other, but by other turnings, unto tho&s;e rocky beds, and cau&s;e the Flowing at Night: and that la&s;tly, the Sun heating likewi&s;e this We&s;tern &s;ide, produceth the like effect, and cau&s;es the third flux in the Morning; which is &s;lower than the two others, either becau&s;e this We&s;tern &s;ide is remote from the Ea&s;tern where the Source is; or becau&s;e that being covered with wood, it is not &s;o &s;oon heated; or by rea&s;on of the cold of the night. Now I found this my rea&s;oning the more cogent, fora&s;much as it &s;eems to agree with what is affirmed, that in the fir&s;t days the water comes in greater abundance than in the latter; and that at la&s;t it &s;tops, and runs not at all; as if indeed in the beginning there were of tho&s;e frozen waters greater plenty in the earth than at la&s;t. It &s;eems al&s;o to agree with what is ob&s;erved, that there are &s;ome days in the beginning, in which one flux is found more abounding than the other, and &s;ometimes more at noon than in the evening or morning, or in the morning more than at noon; it commonly falling out &s;o that &s;ome days there are hotter than others, or that &s;ome clouds ari&s;e which interrupt the equality of the heat, and con&s;equently make the flux unequal.</P>
<P>Returning from <HI>Send-brary</HI> I turn'd a little a&s;ide from the road to go and lye at <HI>Achiavel,</HI> which is an Hou&s;e of plea&s;ure of the ancient Kings of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> and at pre|&s;ent of the Great <HI>Mogol.</HI> That which mo&s;t adorns it, is a Fountain, the water where of diffu&s;eth it &s;elf on all &s;ides round about that Fabrick (which is not de&s;picable) and into the Gardens by an hundred Canals. It breaks out of the Earth, as if by &s;ome violence it a&s;cended up from the bottom of a Well, and that with &s;uch an abundance as might make it to be called a River rather than a Fountain. The water of it is ad|mirably good, and &s;o cold that one can hardly endure to hold ones hand in it. The Garden it &s;elf is very fine, there being curious Walks in it, and &s;tore of Fruit-bearing Trees, of Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricocks and Cherries, and many jets of waters of various figures, and Ponds repleni&s;h'd with Fi&s;h, together with a very high <HI>Ca&s;cata</HI> of water, which by its fall maketh a great Nape of thirty or forty paces long, which hath an admirable effect, e&s;pecially in the night, when under this Nape there is put a great number of little Lamps fitted in holes purpo&s;ely made in the Wall; which maketh a curious &s;hew.</P>
<P>From <HI>Achiavel</HI> I went yet a little more out of my way to pa&s;s through another Roy|al Garden, which is al&s;o very beautiful, and hath the &s;ame plea&s;antne&s;s with that of <HI>Achiavel,</HI> but this is peculiar in it, that in one of its Ponds there are Fi&s;hes that come when they are called, and when you ca&s;t bread to them; the bigge&s;t whereof have gold|en Rings in their No&s;es, with in&s;criptions about them, which they &s;ay that renowned <HI>Nour-Mehalle,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Jehan-Guire,</HI> the Grandfather of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> cau&s;ed to be fa&s;tened in them.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner returned from <HI>Send-brary,</HI> but <HI>Danech-mend-kan,</HI> well &s;atisfied with my Voyage, made me undertake one more, to &s;ee another &s;ure Miracle, as he call'd it, which &s;hould be capable to make me &s;oon change my Religion, and turn <HI>Mu&s;&s;elman.</HI> Go, &s;aith he, to <HI>Baramoulay,</HI> which is not further from hence than <HI>Send-brary;</HI> there you &s;hall find a Mo&s;quee in which is the Tomb of one of our <HI>Pires</HI> or Saints, which &s;till every day works Miracles in curing &s;ick people, that flock thither from all parts: It may be, that you will believe nothing of all tho&s;e miraculous Cures you &s;hall &s;ee; but you will at lea&s;t believe one Miracle, which is done every day, and you may &s;ee with your own eyes: And that is of a big round &s;tone, which the &s;tronge&s;t man is
<PB N="133" REF="401">
hardly able to rai&s;e in the lea&s;t from the ground, but yet eleven men, by praying to that Saint, lift up, as if it were a &s;traw, with the end of their eleven fingers, without any trouble at all, and without being &s;en&s;ible of any weight. Hereupon I began this journey al&s;o, accompanied with my Hor&s;eman and the Countrey-fellow, and being arrived at <HI>Baramoulay,</HI> I found it a place plea&s;ant enough. The Mo&s;quee is &s;ufficient|ly well built, the Tomb of the pretended Saint well adorn'd, and round about it there was &s;tore of people of great devotion, who &s;aid they were &s;ick. Near the Mo&s;quee there was a Kitchen with large Kettles full of Fle&s;h and Rice, which, in my opinion, was the Mangnet drawing the &s;ick people thither, and the Miracle that cured them. On the other &s;ide was the Garden and the Chambers of the <HI>Mullahs,</HI> who with great conveniency, and delight &s;pend their life there, under the &s;hadow of the miraculous Sanctity of this <HI>Pire,</HI> which they are not wanting to celebrate: But as I am always very unhappy in &s;uch occa&s;ions, he did no Miracle that day upon any of the &s;ick. As for the great <HI>Stone,</HI> which was <HI>the</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s I came for; there were Eleven Cheats of the&s;e <HI>Mullahs</HI> that crowded together in a round, and by their long Ve&s;ts hindred me from &s;eeing well in what manner they took and lifted it up, yet &s;aid all, that they held it only with the end of one of their fingers, and that it was as light as a feather. For my part, who had my eyes open, and look'd on narrowly, I perceived well enough, that they took great pains, and they  &s;eemed to me, that they u&s;ed al&s;o the thumb, which they held very firm upon the &s;econd finger bent and clo&s;ed: But yet I was not wanting to cry out as well as the <HI>Mullahs</HI> and all the other a&s;&s;i&s;tants, <HI>Karamet, Karamet,</HI> Miracle, Miracle, giving at the &s;ame time a Roupy for the <HI>Mullahs,</HI> and with great &s;hew of devotion praying them to favour me with &s;uffering me once to be one of the Eleven lifters up of the Stone. They did he&s;itate long before they re&s;olved to permit it, but having given them another Roupy, and made them believe I was per&s;waded of the truth of the Miracle, one of the Eleven gave me his place, they doubtle&s;s imagi|ning, that Ten of them joyned together would be&punc; &s;ufficient to do the bu&s;ine&s;s, though I &s;hould not add much to it, and that they would &s;o range them&s;elves and crowd to|gether, that I &s;hould perceive nothing of their impo&s;ture. But they found them&s;elves egregiou&s;ly deceived, when they &s;aw, that the Stone, which I would not &s;upport but only by the end of my finger, alwayes inclined and fell to my &s;ide, untill at length I found it nece&s;&s;ary to put my thumb to it, and to hold it with my finger as they did; and then we lifted it up from the earth, yet not without much pain. Notwith&s;tand|ing which, when I &s;aw that they all looked upon me a&s;quint, not knowing what to make of me, I &s;till went on crying like the re&s;t, <HI>Karamet,</HI> Miracle, Miracle, and over and above ca&s;ting to them another Roupy to &s;ecure my &s;elf from being &s;ton'd; and &s;tealing away from among the crowd, I pre&s;ently took hor&s;e, without eating or drink|ing, and left the Saint and the Miracles to tho&s;e that had &s;aith enough to believe them: Ob&s;erving, as I pa&s;&s;ed along, that famous opening, which is an outlet to all the waters of this Kingdom, of which I have already &s;aid &s;omething in the beginning of this Book.</P>
<P>I left my way again, to approach to a great Lake, which I &s;aw a far off, thorough the middle whereof pa&s;&s;eth the River that runs 10 <HI>Baramoulay.</HI> It is full of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Eels, and covered with Ducks and wild Fowl, and many other River Fowl. 'Tis where the Governour comes in Winter, at which time 'tis covered with tho&s;e creatures, to di|vert him&s;elf with fowling. In the mid&s;t of this Lake there is an Eremitage with its little Garden, which, as they &s;ay, doth miraculou&s;ly flote upon the water, and where the Eremite pa&s;&s;eth his Life without ever going from it. Be&s;ides which, they make a thou&s;and other ridiculous tales of it, which are not worth reciting, unle&s;s perhaps you will except what &s;ome have told me. That it was one of tho&s;e ancient Kings of <HI>Kache|mire,</HI> who out of curio&s;ity cau&s;ed this Eremitage to be built upon thick beams fa&s;tned to one another.</P>
<P>Thence I went to find out a Fountain, which hath &s;omething that's rare enough in it, bubling up gently, and ri&s;ing with &s;ome little impetuo&s;ity, and making &s;mall bubles of air, and carrying with it, to the top, &s;ome &s;mall Sand that is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, which goeth away again as it came, the Water becoming &s;till, a moment after it, without ebullition, and without bringing up Sand; and &s;oon after beginning afre&s;h as before, and &s;o continu|ing its motion by intervals, which are not regular. But the Wonder, as they &s;ay, con|&s;i&s;ts in this, that the lea&s;t noi&s;e, made by &s;peaking, or by knocking ones foot again&s;t the ground, moveth the water, and maketh it run and bubble as was &s;aid. Yet I found
<PB N="134" REF="402">
plainly, that &s;peaking or knocking availeth nothing to produce that effect, and that it moveth as well when one &s;aith nothing, as when one &s;peaks or knocketh. But now, to give the true cau&s;e of it, <HI>that</HI> requireth more thinking than I have be&s;tow'd upon it; unle&s;s one &s;hould &s;ay, that the Sand, by falling down again, ob&s;tructeth the narrow Channel of this &s;mall and weak Spring, until the water, being clo&s;ed up and kept in, it make an effort to remove and rai&s;e again the Sand, and &s;o to di&s;engage it &s;elf; or rather, that &s;ome wind, pent in the Channel of the Spring, ri&s;es by turns, as it comes to pa&s;s in artificial Fountains.</P>
<P>After we had con&s;idered this Fountain, we entred into the Mountains to &s;ee a great Lake, which hath Ice in Summer, and looketh like a little icy Sea, having heaps of Ice, made and unmade by the Winds. Afterwards we pa&s;&s;ed through a certain place, call'd <HI>Seng-&s;afed,</HI> that is, White &s;tone; which is famous for being full all the Summer long of all &s;orts of Flowers like a <HI>Parterre,</HI> and for this ob&s;ervation, that when much people goes thither, making a great noi&s;e and much &s;tirring the air, there pre&s;ently falls a &s;hower of rain. This is certain, that when, &s;ome years &s;ince, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> went thither, he was in danger of peri&s;hing by the great and extraordinary rain &s;urvening, though he had commanded, they &s;hould make the lea&s;t noi&s;e they could. This agreed with what my Eremite of <HI>Pirepengale</HI> had told me.</P>
<P>And now I was going to a Grotta of odd congelations, which is two days journey from thence; but I received news, that after my &s;o long ab&s;ence my <HI>Navah</HI> was trou|bled about me.</P>
<P>As to the condition of the neighbouring Mountains round about, I have, &s;ince our being here, done what po&s;&s;ibly I could to inform my &s;elf about them; but I have pro|fited but little, for want of people that are intelligent and ob&s;erve things; yet not|with&s;tanding I will not omit to relate to you what I have learn'd of it.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> that go every year from mountain to mountain, ga|thering fine Wool to make tho&s;e Stuffs I have above been &s;peaking of, do all agree, that between the mountains, which &s;till depend from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> there are found very fine places of good land, and that among&s;t others there is one place, which pays it tribute in Leather and Wooll, &s;ent for by the Governour every year; and where the Women are extream hand&s;ome, cha&s;t and laborious; that there is al&s;o another farther off from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> which al&s;o pays its tribute in Leather and Wooll&punc; and hath very pretty, though but &s;mall, fertil plains, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant vallies, abounding in Corn, Rice, Apples, Pears, excellent Apricocks and Melons; as al&s;o in Rai&s;ins yielding very good Wine; the Inhabitants whereof have &s;ometimes refu&s;ed to pay the tribute, relying upon the difficulty of acce&s;s to their Country; but there hath alwayes been a way found to enter and to reduce them. The &s;ame Merchants agree al&s;o, that among the other Mountains, that are more di&s;tant and depend no more from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> there are likewi&s;e found very plea&s;ant Countrys, peopled with very hand&s;om Whites, but &s;uch as almo&s;t never come out from their homes; of which &s;ome have no Kings, nor, as far as could be perceived, any Religion; only that &s;ome of them do eat no Fi&s;h, count|ing them unclean.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add here, what I was lately told by a good ancient man, that had married a Wife of the ancient Family of the Kings of <HI>Kachemire.</HI> He &s;aid, that when <HI>Jehan-Guire</HI> made a &s;trict inquiry after all tho&s;e that were of that Family, he was afraid to be taken, and thereupon fled with three Servants cro&s;e the&s;e mountains, not knowing in a manner whither he went; that thus wandring he came at la&s;t into a very fine &s;mall Canton, where when it came to be known who he was, the inhabitants came to vi&s;it him and brought him pre&s;ents, and that, to make up their kindne&s;s, they brought to him in the evening one of the beautifulle&s;t of their young Maidens, praying him that he would bed with her, becau&s;e they de&s;ired very much to have i&s;&s;ue of his Blood: That pa&s;&s;ing from thence into another Canton, not much di&s;tant from the former, the people likewi&s;e came to &s;ee him, and to pre&s;ent him; but that the kindne&s;s of the evening was far different from the other, in that the&s;e inhabitants brought to him their own Wives, arguing that tho&s;e of the other Canton were Bea&s;ts, becau&s;e that his Blood would not remain in their hou&s;e, &s;ince the Maidens would carry the Child with them into the hou&s;e of him, to whom they &s;hould be married.</P>
<P>I may further add, that &s;ome years &s;ince, there being a di&s;&s;ention ri&s;en between the family of the King of the little <HI>Tibet,</HI> which borders upon <HI>Kachemire,</HI> one of the pre|tenders, to the Crown did &s;ecretly call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Governour of <HI>Kachemire,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="402">
who by order of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> gave him powerful &s;uccours, and put to death or flight all the other pretenders, and left this man in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country, on condi|tion of an annual Tribute to be paid in Cry&s;tal, Musk and Wool. This petty King could not forbear coming to &s;ee <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> bringing with him a pre&s;ent of tho&s;e things I ju&s;t now named; but he had &s;o pitiful a Train, That I &s;hould never have taken him for what he was. My <HI>Navah</HI> entertained him at dinner, that he might receive the better information concerning tho&s;e Mountains. I heard him &s;ay, that his Country on the Ea&s;t &s;ide did confine with great <HI>Tibet;</HI> that it was about 30 or 40 leagues broad; that there was indeed &s;ome little Cry&s;tal, Musk, and Wool, but for the re&s;t very poor; and that there were no Gold Mines as was &s;aid; that in &s;ome places there was very good fruit, e&s;pecially Melons; that they had very hard Winters, and very trouble&s;ome, becau&s;e of the deep Snows; and that the people, which formerly had been Heathen, was almo&s;t all become Mahumetan, as him&s;elf, namely, of that Sect called <HI>Cbia,</HI> which is that of all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Be&s;ides, that &s;eventeen or eighteen years ago <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had attempted to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Kingdom of the Great <HI>Tibet,</HI> as formerly al&s;o had done the Kings of <HI>Kachemire;</HI> that his Army after &s;ixteen days difficult march, always among Mountains, did be&s;iege a Ca&s;tle which they took; that there remain'd no more for him to do, than to pa&s;s a River, which is famous and very rapid, and thereupon to march directly to the Capital Town, which he would have ea&s;ily carried, the whole Kingdom being in a panick terrour; but that the &s;ea&s;on being far &s;pent, the Governour of <HI>Ka|chemire,</HI> who was the General of that Army, did apprehend he &s;hould be &s;urprized by the Snow, and &s;o returned, leaving in that Ca&s;tle a Garri&s;on, which, whether it was from fear of the Enemy, or from want of &s;ufficient provi&s;ion, he could not &s;ay, &s;oon a|bandon'd it; which broke the de&s;ign the Governour had of returning thither the next Spring.</P>
<P>Now that the King of this Great <HI>Tibet</HI> knows, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is at <HI>Kachemire,</HI> and threatens him with War, he hath &s;ent to him an Amba&s;&s;ador, with Pre&s;ents of the Countrey, as Chry&s;tal, and tho&s;e dear White Cow-tails, by way of ornament fa&s;ten'd to the ears of Elephants, as al&s;o Musk, and a Stone of <HI>Jachen</HI> of great price, becau&s;e of an extraordinary bigne&s;s. This <HI>Jachen</HI> is a blewi&s;h Stone with white veins &s;o hard that it is wrought with nothing el&s;e but the Powder of Diamond, highly e&s;teemed in the Court of the <HI>Mogol.</HI> They make Cups of it and other ve&s;&s;els, of which I have &s;ome richly wrought with threads of Gold, of very curious Workman&s;hip. The Train of this Amba&s;&s;ador did con&s;i&s;t of three or four Cavaliers, and ten or twelve tall men, dry and lean, having three or four hairs in their beards like the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and plain red Bon|nets upon their heads like our Seamen, the re&s;t of their Garments &s;uitable. I think there were four or five of them with Swords, but the re&s;t marched behind the Amba&s;&s;a|dor without any rod or &s;tick. He treated with <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in his Ma&s;ters name, pro|mi&s;ing that he would &s;uffer a Mo&s;que to be built in the Capital City, wherein Prayers &s;hould be made after the Mahumetan way; that the Money, henceforth to be coined, &s;hould on the one &s;ide have the Impre&s;s of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and that he would pay him a certain annual Tribute. But 'tis believed, that as &s;oon as this King &s;hall know that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is gone from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> he will laugh at all this Treaty, as he did formerly at that, which he had made with <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;ador had in his &s;uit a Phy&s;ician, which was &s;aid to be of the Kingdom of <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> and of the Tribe <HI>Lamy</HI> or <HI>Lama,</HI> which is that of the men of the Law in that Country, as the <HI>Brahmans</HI> are in the <HI>Indies;</HI> with this difference, that the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have no <HI>Caliph,</HI> or high-Prie&s;t, but the <HI>Lamians</HI> have one that is not only acknowledged for &s;uch by the Kingdom of <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> but al&s;o by all <HI>Tartary,</HI> and who is honoured and re|verenced like a divine per&s;on. This Phy&s;ician had a Book of Receipts, which he would never &s;ell to me; the writing of it &s;eem'd, at a di&s;tance, &s;omewhat like ours. We made him begin to write the Alphabet, but he wrote &s;o &s;lowly, and his writing was &s;o bad in re&s;pect of that in his Book, that we &s;oon judged, this mu&s;t needs be a poor Do|ctor. He was much wedded to the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> or Tran&s;migration of Souls, and was full of admirable &s;tories of it; among the re&s;t he related of his great <HI>Lama,</HI> that when he was old and ready to die, he a&s;&s;embled his Council, and declared to them, that now he was pa&s;&s;ing into the Body of a little Child, lately born, that this Child was bred up with great care, and when it was about &s;ix or &s;even years old, they brought to it &s;tore of hou&s;hold-&s;tuff pel mel with his own, and that the Child was able to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e, that were or had been his from that of others: Which was, &s;aid this Doctor, an au|thentick
<PB N="136" REF="403">
proof of the Tran&s;migration. For my part, I thought at fir&s;t he rallied, but I found at la&s;t, that he &s;poke very &s;eriou&s;ly. I was once to &s;ee him at the Amba&s;&s;adors with a Merchant of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> that knew the Language of <HI>Tibet,</HI> and was an Interpre|ter to me. I made as if I would buy &s;ome Stuffs he had brought to &s;ell, which were &s;ome kind of Ratines of about a foot and an half broad, but it was really to learn &s;ome|thing of that Countrey, yet it was no great matter I obtain'd from him. He only told me in general, that all the Kingdom of the great <HI>Tibet</HI> was, in compari&s;on to his, a mi|&s;erable Countrey, full of Snow for more than five months of the year; that his King made often War with the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but he could never di&s;tingui&s;h to me, what kind of <HI>Tartars</HI> they were. At length, after I had made a good many Que&s;tions to him, without receiving any &s;atisfaction upon them, I &s;aw I lo&s;t only my time with him.</P>
<P>But there is another thing, which is &s;o certain, that no body here doubts of it. 'Tis not yet twenty years, that there went Caravans every year from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> which cro&s;|&s;ed all tho&s;e Mountains of the great <HI>Tibet,</HI> entred into <HI>Tartary,</HI> and arrived in about three months at <HI>Cataja,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the very ill ways, and the rapid Torrents; which latter are to be pa&s;&s;ed over Cords &s;tretched from one Rock to another. The&s;e Ca|ravans brought back <HI>Musk, China-wood, Rubarb,</HI> and <HI>Mamiron,</HI> which la&s;t is a &s;mall root exceeding good for ill Eyes. Repa&s;&s;ing over the great <HI>Tibet</HI> they al&s;o loaded them&s;elves with the Merchandi&s;e of that Countrey, <HI>viz. Musk, Cry&s;tal</HI> and <HI>Jachen,</HI> but e&s;pecially with &s;tore of very fine Wooll of two &s;orts, one of Sheep, and the other called <HI>Touz,</HI> which is rather, as I have &s;aid, a kind of hair approaching to our Ca&s;tor, than a Wooll. But &s;ince the attempt, which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> made on that &s;ide, the King of the great <HI>Ti|bet</HI> hath altogether &s;hut up the way, and &s;uffers not any one from <HI>Kachemire</HI> to enter into his Countrey: And thence it is, that the Caravans at pre&s;ent go from <HI>Patna</HI> upon the <HI>Ganges,</HI> not pa&s;&s;ing through his Countrey at all, but leaving it on the left hand, and coming directly to the Kingdom of <HI>La&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning this Kingdom, here called <HI>Kacheguer,</HI> which doubtle&s;s is that which our Maps call <HI>Ka&s;car,</HI> I &s;hall relate to you what I was able to learn of it from the Merchants of the Countrey it &s;elf, who, knowing that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was to &s;tay a while at <HI>Kache|mire,</HI> were come thither with a good number of Slaves, of both Sexes, whom they had to &s;ell. They &s;ay, that the Kingdom of <HI>Kacheguer</HI> lyeth Ea&s;t of <HI>Kachemire,</HI> drawing a little Northward; that the &s;horte&s;t way thither was to go directly to the great <HI>Tibet;</HI> but that pa&s;&s;age being ob&s;tructed, they were forced to take their way through the little <HI>Tibet;</HI> that fir&s;t they went to a &s;mall Town, call'd <HI>Gourtche,</HI> the la&s;t Town depending from <HI>Kachemire,</HI> and four days journey di&s;tant from the &s;ame; that from thence in eight days they came to <HI>Eskerdou,</HI> the Capital City of the King of the little <HI>Tibet,</HI> and thence in two days more to a &s;mall Town call'd <HI>Cheker,</HI> likewi&s;e belonging to the little <HI>Tibet,</HI> and &s;ituate upon a River very famous for being Medicinal; that in fifteen days they came to a great Fore&s;t upon the Confines of the little <HI>Tibet,</HI> and in fifteen days more to <HI>Kacheguer</HI> a &s;mall Town, once the Seat of the King of <HI>Kacheguer,</HI> which is now at <HI>Jourkend,</HI> lying &s;omewhat more to the North, and ten days journey di&s;tant from <HI>Ka|cheguer.</HI> They added, that from the Town of <HI>Kacheguer</HI> to <HI>Katay</HI> 'tis no more but two months voyage; that every year there go Caravans, bringing back of all tho&s;e Com|modities I have named, and pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> thorough <HI>&V;sbeck,</HI> as there are others that do pa&s;s to <HI>Patna</HI> in <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> They &s;aid moreover, that to go from <HI>Kacheguer</HI> to <HI>Katay,</HI> Travellers mu&s;t get to a Town that is eight days journey from <HI>Coten,</HI> the la&s;t Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Kacheguer;</HI> that the ways from <HI>Kachemire</HI> to <HI>Kacheguer</HI> are very difficult; that among others there is a place, where, in what &s;ea&s;on &s;oever it be, you mu&s;t march for about a quarter of a League upon Ice. This is all, I could learn of tho&s;e parts, which though indeed it be very much confu&s;ed and very little, yet will it be found much, con&s;idering I had to do <HI>both</HI> with people &s;o ignorant, that they almo&s;t knew not to give a rea&s;on of any thing; <HI>and</HI> with Interpreters, who, for the mo&s;t part, know not how to make the Que&s;tions to be under&s;tood, nor intelligibly to deliver the An&s;wers made thereto.</P>
<P>I thought once, I would have here concluded this Letter, or rather this Book, and taken my leave of you untill I came to <HI>Dehil,</HI> whither we are now returning: But &s;ince I am in the vein of writing, and at &s;ome lei&s;ure, I &s;hall endeavour to give you &s;ome &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e Five particulars, you demanded of me in your la&s;t Letter in the name of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Thevenot,</HI> that illu&s;trious per&s;on, who daily giveth us more di&s;cove|ries, without going out of his &s;tudy, than we have learned of tho&s;e that have gone round the World.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Demand, concerning the <HI>Jews.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Should indeed be very glad, as well as <HI>Mon&s;ieur The, venote</HI> that there were <HI>Jews</HI> to be found in the Valley of tho&s;e Mountains, who might be &s;uch, as I believe he would have them; I mean, of tho&s;e <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> tran&s;ported by <HI>Salmana&s;&s;er.</HI> But you may a&s;&s;ure him, that if anciently there have been of them in this place (as there is &s;ome rea&s;on to believe there were,) there are none of them at pre&s;ent, and all the inhabi|tants of it are now either Gentiles or Mahumetans; and that perhaps 'tis <HI>China,</HI> where they may be found. For I have lately &s;een, in the hands of our Reverend Father, the Je&s;uit of <HI>Dehli,</HI> &s;ome Letters of a <HI>German</HI> Je&s;uite written from <HI>Pekin,</HI> taking notice that he had there &s;een &s;ome of them, that had pre&s;erved the Jewi&s;h Religion and the Old Te&s;tament, that knew nothing of the Death of JESUS CHRIST, and that they would even have made this Je&s;uite their <HI>Kacan,</HI> if he would have forborn to eat Swines fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Mean time <HI>here</HI> al&s;o are not wanting &s;everal marks of <HI>Judai&s;m.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that at the entring into this Kingdom, after having pa&s;&s;ed the Mountains of <HI>Pire-penjale,</HI> all the Inhabitants I &s;aw in the fir&s;t Villages &s;eemed to me to be <HI>Jews,</HI> in their garbe and meen, and in &s;omething peculiar, which maketh us often di&s;cern Nations frome one another. I am not the only per&s;on, that hath had this thought; our Father, the Je|&s;uite, and many of our <HI>Europeans</HI> had the &s;ame before me. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, that I have ob&s;erv'd, that among the meaner &s;ort of the people of this Town, though they be Mahumetans, yet the name of <HI>Mou&s;a,</HI> that is <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> is much u&s;ed. The <HI>third,</HI> that commonly they &s;ay, that <HI>Salomon</HI> came into their Country, and that it was he that cut the Mountain of <HI>Baramoule</HI> to give an outlet to the waters. The <HI>fourth,</HI> that they &s;ay, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> died at <HI>Kachemire,</HI> and that his Tomb is one league di&s;tant from this Town. The <HI>fifth,</HI> that they pretend, that that little and very ancient Edifice, which appears from hence upon an high mountain, was built by <HI>Salomon,</HI> and that thence they call it to this very day the <HI>Throne of Salomon.</HI> So that I would not deny, but that &s;ome Jews may have penetrated hither; and that in length of time they may have lo&s;t the purity of their Law, turned Idolaters, at la&s;t Mahumetans. In &s;hort, we &s;ee &s;tore of the Jewi&s;h Nation that have pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Lar, I&s;pahan,</HI> and al&s;o into <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Cochin:</HI> I have been informed, that there were of them in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> even gallant and military men, and &s;ome of them &s;o con&s;iderable and po|tent, that there was one of them, fifteen or &s;ixteen years agoe, that had attempted to make him&s;elf King of a little Country of the Mountains of a very hard acce&s;s; if it be true, what two Amba&s;&s;adours of the King of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> that were lately in this Court, related to me.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the Second Demand, about the <HI>&s;tated Rains</HI> in the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Sun is &s;o &s;trong and violent in the <HI>Indies</HI> all the year long, and principally for the &s;pace of <HI>eight</HI> months, that he would burn all, and render the Country barren and inhabitable, if Providence had not particularly provided and di&s;po&s;ed things in &s;o admirable a way, as that in the month of <HI>July,</HI> when the heats are mo&s;t violent, Rains begin regularly to fall, which continuing for three months together, do temper the Earth, and render it very fruitful, and &s;o qualifie the Air that it may be endured. Yet are not the&s;e Rains &s;o regular, that they fall always ju&s;t at the &s;ame time; of which I have made many ob&s;ervations in different places, and principally at <HI>Dehli,</HI> where I lived a long while. The like is fourd in other Countries; and there is always &s;ome
<PB N="138" REF="404">
difference in the time from year to year: For &s;ometimes they begin or end a fortnight or three weeks &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later; and there are al&s;o &s;ome years, in which they are not &s;o plentiful as in others; in&s;omuch that two years, together it did almo&s;t not rain at all; which cau&s;ed much Sickne&s;s, and great Famine. Be&s;ides, there is al&s;o this difference in re&s;pect of Countries different and remote from one another, that the&s;e Rains ordinarily begin &s;ooner, or are more plentiful in one than in the other. For ex|ample, in <HI>Bengale</HI> and along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> as far as to the I&s;le of <HI>Ceilan,</HI> they begin and end a month &s;ooner than towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar:</HI> And in <HI>Bengale</HI> the&s;e Rains are pouring down for four months, and &s;ometimes continue for eight days and nights together without intermi&s;&s;ion; Whereas at <HI>Dehli</HI> and <HI>Agra</HI> they are never &s;o &s;trong, nor &s;o durable, there pa&s;&s;ing &s;ometimes two or three whole days without any Rain; and ordinarily the whole morning from break of day until about nine or ten a clock it rains but very little or nothing. But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable difference I have; ob&s;erv'd, is, that the rains in divers places come from different quarters of the World, as about <HI>Dehli</HI> they come from the Ea&s;t, where lies <HI>Bengale;</HI> whereas, on the contrary, in the parts of <HI>Bengale</HI> and upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> they come from the South; and upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> they proceed almo&s;t always from the We&s;t.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved another particular about which they all agree in tho&s;e parts, <HI>viz.</HI> That according as the Heat of the Summer comes &s;ooner or later, is more or le&s;s violent, and la&s;ts longer or a &s;horter time; the Rains al&s;o come &s;ooner or later, are more or le&s;s plentiful, la&s;t longer or a &s;horter time.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;ervations have given me ground to believe, that the Heat of the Earth and the Rarefaction of the Air mu&s;t be the principal cau&s;es of the&s;e Rains, and draw them; fora&s;much as the Air of the Seas, which lie near round about the Lands, being colder, more conden&s;ed, and more gro&s;&s;e, filled with clouds which the great heats of the Summer rai&s;e from the waters, and which the winds drive and agitate, di&s;chargeth it &s;elf ea&s;ily upon the Land, where the Air is hotter, more rarified, in more motion and le&s;s re&s;i&s;ting than upon the Seas, &s;o as that this di&s;charge is more or le&s;s tardy and abundant, according as the Heat comes &s;ooner and is more violent.</P>
<P>Sutable to the &s;ame Ob&s;ervations I was per&s;waded that if the Rains begin &s;ooner upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>coromandel</HI> than upon that of <HI>Malabar,</HI> 'tis by rea&s;on that the Sum|mer begins there &s;ooner, it being po&s;&s;ible that there it may do &s;o for &s;ome particular rea&s;ons, which perhaps would not be hard to find, if the Country were well examin'd: For we know, that according to the different &s;ituation of a Land in re&s;pect of Seas or Mountains, and according as 'tis more Sandy, or Hilly, or Woody, the Summer comes there either &s;ooner or later, and with more or le&s;s violence.</P>
<P>I am further per&s;waded, that it is no wonder, that the Rains come from different quarters; that upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> for example, they come from the South, and upon that of <HI>Malabar</HI> from the We&s;t; becau&s;e that in all appearance it mu&s;t be the neare&s;t Seas that &s;end them, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> is nearer to the Sea, which lyeth Southerly in re&s;pect of it, and is more expo&s;ed to it, as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> is to the We&s;t of it, lying towards <HI>Bahelmandel, Arabia,</HI> and the Gulf of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, I have imagined, that if at <HI>Dehli,</HI> for example, the Rains come from the Ea&s;t, it may yet be that the Seas which are Southerly to it, are the origin of them; but that they are forced by rea&s;on of some Mountains, or &s;ome other Lands where the Air is colder, more conden&s;ed and more re&s;i&s;ting, to turn a&s;ide and di&s;charge them&s;elves another way, where the Air is more rarified, and where con&s;equently they find le&s;s re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, that I al&s;o ob&s;erved at <HI>Dehli,</HI> that there it never rains to purpo&s;e, till for many days there have pa&s;&s;ed &s;tore of Clouds We&s;tward&punc; as if it were nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e &s;paces of Air which are beyond <HI>Dehli</HI> We&s;tward, &s;hould be fir&s;t filled with Clouds, and that the&s;e Clouds finding there &s;ome ob&s;tacle, as it may be &s;ome Air le&s;s hot and le&s;s rarified, and con&s;equently more conden&s;ed and more able to re&s;i&s;t, or &s;ome other contrary Clouds and Winds repelling them, &s;hould become &s;o thick, &s;o burthen|&s;om and &s;o heavy, that they mu&s;t fall down in Rain, after the &s;ame manner as it often enough falls out, when the Wind driveth the Clouds again&s;t &s;ome high Mountain.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the third Demand, which is concerning the <HI>Regularity</HI> of the Cur|rent of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and of the <HI>Winds</HI> in the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Rains do cea&s;e (which ordinarily comes to pa&s;s toward s themonth of <HI>October,)</HI> it is ob&s;erved, that the Sea taketh its cour&s;e Southward, and that the cold <HI>Northern</HI> Winds ari&s;eth. This Wind blows for four or five months without intermi&s;&s;ion and without &s;torms, always keeping the &s;ame equality as to its &s;trength and quarter, unle&s;s it change or cea&s;e a day or &s;o by accident, but then it returns again unto its former place and temper. After that time; for two months or there about the other Winds do reign without any rule. The&s;e two months being pa&s;t, which is call|ed the <HI>Intermediate</HI> &s;ea&s;on, or, according to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the <HI>Wavering</HI> or Changing Sea&s;on, the Sea returns back from South to North, and the South-wind ri&s;eth to reign al&s;o in his turn for four or five months, as the Current of the Sea doth: &s;o that there pa&s;s two months of intermediate &s;ea&s;on; during which, Navigation is very difficult and dangerous, whereas during the two Sea&s;ons it is very ea&s;ie, plea&s;ant and without peril, except it be about the end of the &s;ea&s;on of the South-wind. Hence you may find cau&s;e not to wonder, if you hear that the <HI>Indians,</HI> though el&s;e very timorous and inex|pert in the art of Navigation, do notwith&s;tanding make pretty long and con&s;iderable Voyages; as when they &s;ail from <HI>Bengale</HI> to <HI>Tana&s;&s;ery, Achem, Malaque, Sian</HI> and <HI>Ma|ka&s;&s;ar;</HI> or to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan, Ceilan,</HI> the <HI>Maldives, Moka,</HI> and <HI>Bender-Aba&s;&s;y;</HI> becau&s;e they take their time to go with one good Sea&s;on, and to return with the other. 'Tis true, that oft enough they are &s;urpri&s;ed and ca&s;t away; but that is, when they cannot di&s;|patch their affairs in good time, or fail of taking their mea&s;ures. Our <HI>Europeans</HI> al&s;o do &s;ometimes lo&s;e them&s;elves, though they be far better Sea-men, bolder and more under&s;tanding, and their Ships better condition'd and equipped.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e two intermediate Sea&s;ons, that which maketh the <HI>South-wind</HI> is incompar|ably more dangerous than the other, and much more &s;ubject to tempe&s;ts and &s;torms: And even in the Sea&s;on it &s;elf this wind is ordinarily much more impetuous and unequ|al than that of the <HI>North.</HI> And here I mu&s;t not omit to give you a remark, which is, that about the end of the Sea&s;on of the South-wind, during the time of the rain, al|though there be a great calm out at Sea, yet 'tis very tempe&s;tuous near the Coa&s;ts; to the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty leagues: whence the Ships of <HI>Europe</HI> or others, when they will approach the <HI>Indian</HI> Coa&s;ts, for example, of <HI>Suratte,</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> mu&s;t be very careful of taking their time to arrive ju&s;t after the Rains; or el&s;e they run great hazard of being &s;plit and lo&s;t upon the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This is very near what I could ob&s;erve of the Sea&s;ons in the&s;e parts; of which I much wi&s;h I could give you a good rea&s;on. I &s;hall venture to tell you, that it came into my thoughts, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the Air, which environs the Globe of the Earth, ought to be e&s;teemed to have a &s;hare in it, as al&s;o the Water of the Sea and Rivers, fora&s;much as both the one and the other gravitate upon this Globe, tend to the &s;ame Center of it, and &s;o are in &s;ome manner united and fa&s;ten'd to it; &s;o that from the&s;e three Bo|dies, the Air, the Water and the Earth, there re&s;ults as 'twere one great Globe. <HI>Next,</HI> that the Globe of the Earth being &s;u&s;pended and balanced, as it is, in its place, in that free and un-re&s;i&s;ted &s;pace, where the Creator thought good to place it, would be cap|able to be ea&s;ily mov'd, if &s;ome adventitious Body &s;hould come again&s;t it and hit it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that the Sun having pa&s;t the Line to move towards one of the Poles, for exam|ple, the <HI>Arctique,</HI> coming to ca&s;t its rays that way, maketh there impre&s;&s;ion enough to depre&s;s a little the <HI>Arctique</HI> Pole, and to do that more and more according as it advan|ceth towards the <HI>Tropique;</HI> letting it ri&s;e again by little and little, according as he returns towards the <HI>Line,</HI> untill by the force of his rayes he do the like on the &s;ide of the <HI>Antar|tique</HI> Pole.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, joyn'd to that of the <HI>Diurnal</HI> Motion of the Earth, were true, it were not me-thinks, without rea&s;on what is commonly affirm'd in the <HI>Indies, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Sun</HI> conducts and carries with him the Sea and Wind. For if it be true, that having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Line</HI> to go towards one of the Poles, he cau&s;eth a change in the di|rection of the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth, and a depre&s;&s;ion in the Pole on that &s;ide, the other Pole mu&s;t needs be rai&s;ed, and that con&s;equently the Sea and the Air, being two fluid and heavy Bodies, run down in this inclination: &s;o that it would be true to &s;ay, that the Sun advancing towards <HI>one</HI> Pole, cau&s;eth on that &s;ide two great regular Currents,
<PB N="140" REF="405">
<HI>viz,</HI> that of the Sea, and that of the Air which maketh the <HI>Moun&s;on-wind,</HI> as he cau&s;eth two oppo&s;ite ones, when he returns towards the other Pole.</P>
<P>Upon this ground, methinks, it might be &s;aid, that there are no other but two <HI>main</HI> oppo&s;ite Fluxes of the Sea, one from the &s;ide of the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> the other from that of the <HI>Antartique;</HI> that if there were a Sea from one Pole to the other, that pa&s;&s;ed through our <HI>Europe,</HI> we &s;hould &s;ee, that the&s;e two Currents would there be regular every where, as they are in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that that which hinders this regularity of the Flux from being general, is, that the Seas are intercepted by Lands, which impede, break, and vary their Cour&s;e; in like manner as &s;ome &s;ay, that the Ordinary Flux and Reflux of the Sea is hinder'd in tho&s;e Seas that lye in length, as the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> doth from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. And &s;o likewi&s;e might it be &s;aid upon the &s;ame Foundation, that there are but two principal oppo&s;ite Winds or Fluxes of the Air, and that they would be univer&s;ally regular, if the Earth were perfectly &s;mooth and equall, and one part like another every where,</P>

<HEAD>An An&s;wer to the Fourth Que&s;tion, concerning the Fertility, Riches and Beauty of the Kingdom <HI>of Bengale.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL Ages have &s;poken of <HI>Egypt</HI> as of the be&s;t and fruitfulle&s;t part of the World&punc; and Writers will not grant, there is any Country comparable to it: But as far as I can &s;ee by the two Voyages I have made in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> I am of opinion, that that advantage belongs rather to it, than to <HI>Egypt.</HI> It bears <HI>Rice</HI> in that abun|dance, that it not only furni&s;hes its Neighbours, but many very remote parts. 'Tis car|ried up the River <HI>Ganges</HI> to <HI>Patna;</HI> and 'tis tran&s;ported by Sea to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> and to many others Ports of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel.</HI> Be&s;ides, 'tis &s;ent away into forrain Kingdoms, and principally into <HI>Ceilan</HI> and the <HI>Maldives.</HI> Further, it al&s;o abounds in <HI>Sugar,</HI> &s;o that it furni&s;hes with it the Kingdoms of <HI>Golkonda</HI> and <HI>Karnates,</HI> where there grows but very little. <HI>Arabia</HI> al&s;o and <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> are thence provided with it, by the way of <HI>Moka</HI> and <HI>Baffora;</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> it &s;elf, by <HI>Bander-Aba&s;&s;y.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Bengale</HI> is al&s;o the Country of good <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">its,</HI> e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places where the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> are, who are dextrous in making them, and drive a great trade with them. They ordina|rily make &s;tore of tho&s;e big Pome-Citrons, as we have in <HI>Europe;</HI> and a certain Root, which is longi&s;h like <HI>Sarfaperilla,</HI> and very delicate; and of that common Fruit of the <HI>Indies</HI> call'd <HI>Amba,</HI> and of <HI>Ananas,</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>Mirobolans,</HI> which are excellent; as al&s;o of <HI>Limons</HI> and <HI>Ginger.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that the Country of <HI>Bengale</HI> yields not &s;o much <HI>Corn</HI> as <HI>Egypt;</HI> but if that be a defect, it is to be imputed to its Inhabitants that eat very little Bread, and much more Rice than the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> Yet it alwayes bears what is &s;ufficient for the Country, and to afford excellent Bi&s;cuits, very cheap, for the provi&s;ion of our <HI>European</HI> Ships, <HI>Eng|li&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> You may there have almo&s;t for nothing tho&s;e three or four kinds of <HI>Legumes,</HI> which together with Rice and Butter are the mo&s;t u&s;ual food of the meaner people: And for a <HI>Roupy,</HI> which is about half a Crown, you may have twenty good Pullets and more; Gee&s;e and Ducks, in proportion. There are al&s;o kids and Sheep in abundance, and &s;uch &s;tore of Pork, that the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> &s;etled there and ac|cu&s;tomed to the Country, live almo&s;t on nothing el&s;e but that; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> victual their Ships with it. There is al&s;o plenty of many &s;orts of Fi&s;h, both fre&s;h and falt: And, in a word, <HI>Bengale</HI> is a Country abounding in all things; and 'tis for this very rea&s;on, that &s;o many <HI>Portugue&s;es, Me&s;ticks,</HI> and other Chri&s;tians are fled thither from tho&s;e quarters, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have taken from them. For, the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tinians,</HI> that have great Churches there, wherein they exerci&s;e their Religion with all freedom, did a&s;&s;ure me, that in <HI>Ogouli</HI> alone there were no le&s;s than eight or nine thou&s;and Souls of Chri&s;tians; and (which I will ea&s;ily believe) that in the re&s;t of that Kingdom there were above twenty five thou&s;ands. And 'tis this affluence of all tho&s;e things nece&s;&s;ary for life, joyned to the Beauty and good Humour of the Women natives, that hath occa&s;ioned this <HI>Proverb</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Portuguefes, Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Holan|ders, viz&punc;</HI> That there are an hundred open Gates to enter into the Kingdom of <HI>Ben|gale,</HI> and not one to come away again.</P>
<P>As to the Commodities of great value; and which draw the Commerce of Strangers thither&punc; I know not, whether there be a Country in the World, that affords more and greater variety: For, be&s;ides the <HI>Sugar</HI> I have &s;poken of, which may be numbred among&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="405">
the Commodities of value, there is &s;uch &s;tore of <HI>Cottons</HI> and <HI>Silks,</HI> that it may be &s;aid, that <HI>Bengale</HI> is as 'twere the general Magazine thereof, not only for <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> or the Empire of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> but al&s;o for all the circumjacent Kingdoms, and for <HI>Europe</HI> it &s;elf. I have &s;ometimes &s;tood amazed at the va&s;t quantity of Cotton-Cloth of all &s;orts, fine and others, tinged and white, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> alone draw from thence and tran&s;port into many places, e&s;pecially into <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> not to mention what the <HI>Engli&s;h, Portingal</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants carry away from tho&s;e parts. The like may be &s;aid of the Silks and Silk-Stuffs of all &s;orts: One would not imagine the quan|tity, that is hence tran&s;ported every year; for, this Country furni&s;hes generally all this great Empire of <HI>Mogol</HI> as far as <HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Caboul,</HI> and mo&s;t of the other forrain parts, whither Cotton-Cloth is carried. 'Tis true, that the&s;e Silks are not &s;o fine as tho&s;e, of <HI>Per&s;ia, Syria, Sayd</HI> and <HI>Barnt;</HI> but then there is al&s;o a great difference in the price; and I know from good hands, that who&s;oever &s;hall take care of choo&s;ing them well, and of getting them well wrought, may have very good Stuffs made of them. The <HI>Hol|landers</HI> alone have &s;ometimes &s;even hundred or eight hundred men of the Natives at work in their Factory of <HI>Ka&s;&s;em-Bazar;</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other Merchants have theirs in proportion.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o in <HI>Bengale,</HI> where that prodigious quantity of <HI>Salt-peter</HI> is found; which is &s;o conveniently carried down the River <HI>Ganges</HI> from <HI>Patna,</HI> and where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> load whole Ships full for many places of the <HI>Indies</HI> and for <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, 'tis <HI>Bengale,</HI> whence the good <HI>Lacca, Opium, Wax, Civet, long Pepper</HI> do come; and even <HI>Butter</HI> is to be had there in &s;o great plenty, that though it be a gro&s;s Commodity, yet notwith&s;tanding 'tis thence tran&s;ported into divers places.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that the Air, in regard of Strangers, is not &s;o healthy there, e&s;pecially near the Sea: And when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> fir&s;t came to &s;ettle there many of them dyed; and I have &s;een in <HI>Bala&s;or</HI> two very fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, which having been obliged, by rea&s;on of the War of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to &s;tay there above a year, were not able to go to Sea, becau&s;e mo&s;t of their Men were lo&s;t. Yet &s;ince the time that they have taken care and made orders, as well as the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that their people &s;hall not drink &s;o much <HI>Bouleponges,</HI> nor go &s;o often a &s;hore to vi&s;it the Sellers of <HI>Arac</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Women; and &s;ince they have found, that a little Wine of <HI>Bourdeaux, Canary</HI> or <HI>Chiras</HI> is a marvellous Antidote again&s;t the ill Air; there is not &s;o much &s;ickne&s;s among&s;t them, nor do they now lo&s;e &s;o many men. <HI>Bouleponge</HI> is a certain beverage made of <HI>Arac,</HI> that is, of &s;trong water, black Sugar, with the Juice of Limon water, and a little Mu&s;cadine upon it; which is plea&s;ant enough to the ta&s;te, but a plague to the Body and to Health.</P>
<P>As to the Beauty of the Country, you are to know, that all <HI>Bengale,</HI> taking it near an hundred leagues in length on both &s;ides of <HI>Ganges,</HI> from <HI>Raje-mehale</HI> unto the Sea, is full of great Channels, formerly cut out of the River <HI>Ganges</HI> with va&s;t labour, reach|ing far into the Country for the conveniency of tran&s;porting Commodities, and the Water it &s;elf, which by the <HI>Indians</HI> is counted the be&s;t in the world. The&s;e Channels are on both &s;ides lined with well&punc;peopled Villages and Burroughs of Gentiles, and the large Fields, lying near them, bear abundance of Rice, Sugar, Corn, Legumes, Mu&s;tard, <HI>Sezamum</HI> for Oil, <HI>&s;mall</HI> Mulberries of two or three foot high, to feed Silk|worms. But then the va&s;t number of great and &s;mall I&s;les, that are in the mid&s;t of <HI>Ganges,</HI> and fill all that great &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even days journey, (as there is in &s;ome places of this River from one &s;ide to the other;) this giveth an incomparable Beauty to the Country: For, they are very fertile, filled with fruit-bearing Trees, <HI>Ananas's,</HI> and all &s;orts of verdure, and interlaced with a thou&s;and little Channels, which you cannot &s;ee the end of, as if they were &s;o many Water-mails all covered with Trees. The wor&s;t of it is, that many of the&s;e I&s;les that are next the Sea, are now abandoned by rea&s;on of tho&s;e <HI>Cor&s;aires,</HI> the <HI>Franguys</HI> of <HI>Rakan,</HI> el&s;ewhere &s;poken of; and that they have at pre&s;ent no other Inhabitants but Tigers (which &s;ometimes &s;wim over from one I&s;le to the other) and Gazelles, and Hoggs, and Poultry grown wild. And 'tis upon the account of the&s;e Tigers, that for people travelling between the&s;e little I&s;les in &s;mall boats, as u&s;ually they do, 'tis dangerous in many places to land; be&s;ides, great care is to be had, that the boat, which in the night is fa&s;tened to Trees, be not too near the Bank; for there are now and then &s;ome men &s;urpri&s;ed; and I have heard it &s;aid, that Tigers have been &s;o bold as to come into the boats, and to carry away men that were a&s;leep, chu&s;ing the bigge&s;t and fatte&s;t of them, if one may believe the Water-men of he Country.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="406">
I remember, I made once a voyage of ten days, from <HI>Pipli</HI> to <HI>Ogouli,</HI> between tho&s;e I&s;les and Channels; which I cannot forbear to relate to you, becau&s;e there pa&s;&s;ed not a day without &s;ome extraordinary accident. My Chaloupe of &s;even Oars was no &s;ooner got out of the River&punc; <HI>Pipli,</HI> and advanced 3 or 4 leagues into the Sea along the coa&s;t, to gain the I&s;les and the Channels, but we &s;aw the Sea covered with Fi&s;hes like huge Carps, pur&s;ued by a Shole of Dolphins. I made my men row that way, and &s;aw, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e Fi&s;hes lay along the Coa&s;t as if they were dead; that &s;ome advanced a little, others played and tumbled as if they were drunk. We all la|boured to take &s;ome of them, and we caught 124 with our hands without any difficul|ty. Viewing them I ob&s;erved, that out of all their mouths there came out a bladder (like tho&s;e that are in Carps,) which was full of Air, and reddi&s;h at the end. I ima|gined ea&s;ily, that this mu&s;t be the bladder which kept them from &s;inking; but I could not conceive, why it &s;hould thus come out of their mouth, unle&s;s it were that they had been long and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by tho&s;e Dolphins, and had made &s;o great an effort to fly away as to make this bladder thus &s;well, and colour, and to hang out of their mouth. I afterwards told this thing to an hundred Sea-men, but they could not be|lieve it, and I never found but one <HI>Dutch</HI> Pilot, who told me, that &s;ailing once upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> he had met with the like, and that pre&s;ently they put out their Boat to Sea, and took, as I did, with their hands abundance of Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The day after, about even, we came among tho&s;e I&s;les, and after we had look'd for a place, where 'twas likely no Tigers would come, we landed, made fire, dre&s;&s;ed a couple of Pullets, and our Fi&s;h, which was excellent. Pre&s;ently after Supper I made my men row until night, and for fear of lo&s;ing our way between tho&s;e Channels in the dark, we retired out of the great Channel, and found a good &s;helter in &s;ome &s;mall Creek, where we fa&s;ten'd our boat to a thick branch of a Tree, far enough from the Land, for fear of Tigers. In the night, when I was watching, there fell out a <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> accident, of which kind two had happen'd to me afore in <HI>Dehli.</HI> I &s;aw a <HI>Rainbow</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> which I &s;hew'd to all my Company, and which very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilots I had taken into my Boat at the de&s;ire of a friend, who had never &s;een nor heard of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>The third day we went a&s;tray between the&s;e Channels, and if we had not met with &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> making Salt in one of the I&s;les, that directed us in our way, I know not what would have become of us. But behold another Philo&s;ophical accident. In the night, being got again under &s;helter in a little Channel, my <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> that &s;till were concerned about the Rainbow of the la&s;t night, and whom that Ob&s;ervation had made more curious to behold the Heavens, awaken'd me, and &s;hew'd me another, as fair and as well form'd as that was, which I had &s;hewed them. Mean time I would not have you think, that I mi&s;took an <HI>Iris</HI> or Rainbow for a <HI>Corona,</HI> or Crown. There is no month almo&s;t but at <HI>Dehli</HI> the&s;e Lunar Rainbows are &s;een in the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains, when the Moon is high above the Horizon: And I found that it mu&s;t be &s;o; having &s;een of them three or four nights one after another, and &s;ometimes double ones. They were not Circles about the Moon, but oppo&s;ite to her, and in the like Po&s;ition with Solar Rainbows: And as often as I have &s;een them, the Moon was We&s;tward, and the Rainbow Ea&s;tward. The Moon was al&s;o near full; which in my opinion, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e at other times &s;he would not have light enough to form any. La&s;tly, the&s;e Rainbows were not &s;o white as the Crowns u&s;e to be, but much more coloured, in&s;omuch that there might be di&s;cerned in them &s;ome di&s;tinction of Colours. And thus you &s;ee, how I have been more happy than the Ancients, who, according to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> had ob&s;erved none &s;uch before him.</P>
<P>The fourth day about evening we retired out of the great Channel, as we u&s;ed to do, into a very fair place of &s;afety; but had one of the mo&s;t extraordinary nights that ever I knew. There was not a breath of wind, and the Air was &s;o hot and &s;tuffing that we could &s;carce breath. The Bu&s;hes round us were &s;o full of tho&s;e little &s;hining worms, that they &s;eem'd to be on fire; and there aro&s;e fires here and there, which were like flames, and frighten'd my Sea-men, who &s;aid, they were Devils. Among the re&s;t there aro&s;e two, that were very extraordinary; one was a great Globe of fire, which in falling and &s;pinning la&s;ted above the time of &s;aying a <HI>Pater no&s;ter;</HI> and the other, which la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour, was like a little Tree all in a flame.</P>
<P>The night of the fifth day was terrible and dangerous. There aro&s;e &s;o great a &s;torm, that though we were under the &s;helter of Trees, and that our &s;mall Boat was well
<PB N="143" REF="406">
fa&s;ten'd, yet notwith&s;tanding all that, the Wind broke our Cable, and was ca&s;ting us into the great Channel, where we had infallibly peri&s;h'd, if I had not, together with my two <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> pre&s;ently laid hold on the Branches of &s;ome Trees, where we held fa&s;t for above two hours, whil&s;t the &s;torme la&s;ted: For there was no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be ex|pected from my <HI>Indian</HI> Oar-men, whom fright had made incapable to help us in this occa&s;ion. But, what was mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and amazing, there fell a Rain as if it had been pour'd down with buckets, which filled our Boat, and was accompanied with &s;uch Lightning and Thunder-claps, very near our head, that every moment we thought we &s;hould &s;ink.</P>
<P>The remainder of our Voyage unto the ninth day, when I arriv'd at <HI>Ogouli,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed very well and with plea&s;ure; for I could not be &s;atisfi'd with beholding &s;uch beautiful Countries: Mean time my Trunk and all my Baggage was wet, my Pullets dead, my Fi&s;h &s;poiled, and all my bi&s;cuit drunk with water.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the Fifth Que&s;tion, about the Increa&s;e of the <HI>Nile.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I do not know, whether <HI>I</HI> &s;hall acquit my &s;elf, in re&s;pect of this <HI>Fifth Que&s;tion,</HI> as it were to be wi&s;h'd: But <HI>I</HI> &s;hall faithfully impart to you what <HI>I</HI> have &s;et down of it, after <HI>I</HI> had twice ob&s;erved the <HI>Nile</HI>'s Increa&s;e, and carefully examined the &s;ame, and taken notice withal of &s;ome things in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which have afforded me greater aids for it, than that Learned Man could have, that hath &s;o ingeniou&s;ly written of it, though he never &s;aw <HI>Egypt</HI> but in his Study.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid in another place, that at the time when the two Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> were at <HI>Dehli,</HI> my <HI>Agah Danechmend-kan,</HI> who is extraordinarily curious, &s;ent often for them, to inform him&s;elf, in my pre&s;ence, of the Condition and Govern|ment of their Country; and one day, among&s;t other things, we occa&s;ion'd them to di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Source</HI> of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which they call <HI>Abbabile;</HI> whereof they &s;pake to us as a thing &s;o known that no body doubted of it, and where one of the&s;e Amba&s;&s;a|dours, and a Mogolian, that was return'd with him out of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> had been in per&s;on. They told us, that it taketh its Origin in the Country of the <HI>Agaus,</HI> and i&s;&s;ueth out of the Earth at two big bubling Springs, near one another, which form a &s;mall Lake of about thirty or forty paces long; that at the coming out of this Lake it is then al|ready a pretty River, and that from place to place it receiveth other Rivers which en|large it. They added, that it runs bending, and forming a great Pen-in&s;ule, and that after &s;everal <HI>Ca&s;cata's</HI> from &s;teep Rocks, it falls into a great Lake, which is not above four or five days journey from its Source, in the Country of <HI>Dumbia</HI> or <HI>Dembea,</HI> three little days journey from <HI>Gonder,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> that having traver&s;ed that Lake, it i&s;&s;ueth thence &s;well'd with all the waters that fall there, pa&s;&s;eth through <HI>Sonnar,</HI> the principal City of the King of <HI>Funges</HI> or <HI>Barharis,</HI> tributary to the King of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> running on and making the Cataracts, and &s;o entring into the Plains of <HI>Me&s;&s;er,</HI> which is <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>After we had learned the&s;e particularities of the Source and Cour&s;e of the <HI>Nile,</HI> I asked him, (to judge whereabout the Source of the <HI>Nile</HI> might be) towards which part of the World they believed the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">trey of <HI>Dumbia,</HI> wherein is <HI>Gonder,</HI> to be, in re|&s;pect of <HI>Babel-mandel?</HI> But they knew not what to an&s;wer to this, but only, that they went alwayes We&s;tward, and e&s;pecially the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, (who was obliged to know better, and to take more Notice of the Po&s;ition of the World, than the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> becau&s;e the Turks are obliged in &s;aying their Prayers to turn them&s;elves towards <HI>Mecca)</HI> did a&s;&s;ure me, that I was not at all to doubt thereof: Which did a&s;toni&s;h me ve|ry much, becau&s;e, according to their De&s;cription, the Source of the <HI>Nile</HI> &s;hould be much on this &s;ide of the <HI>Aequinoctial,</HI> whereas all our Maps with <HI>Ptolomie</HI> place it a good way beyond it.</P>
<P>We al&s;o asked them, at what time it did u&s;e to rain in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and whether there were regular Sea&s;ons of Rain as in the <HI>Indies?</HI> To which they an&s;wer'd, that it rain'd almo&s;t never upon that Coa&s;t of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ken-Arkiko,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Ma&s;ouva</HI> to <HI>Babelmandel,</HI> no more than it doth at <HI>Moka,</HI> which is on the other &s;ide, in the <HI>Happy Arabia;</HI> but that in the Heart of the Country, in the Province of <HI>Agaus,</HI> and in that of <HI>Dumbia</HI> and the circumjacent places it rained much for two of the hot|te&s;t months of the Summer, and at the &s;ame time when it rain'd in the <HI>Indies;</HI> which was al&s;o, according to my computation, the very time of the Increa&s;e of the <HI>Nile</HI> in
<PB N="144" REF="407">
<HI>Egypt.</HI> They &s;aid further, that they knew very well; it was the Rain of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> which &s;welled the <HI>Nile,</HI> overflowed <HI>Egypt,</HI> and fertilized the ground of it by the &s;lime it carried upon it; and that it was even therefore, that the Kings of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> pretend|ed a Tribute to be due to them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that, when the Mahumetans made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, ill treating the Chri&s;tians of the Country, they had a mind to turn the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Nile</HI> another way, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Red-Sea, thereby to ruine <HI>Egypt</HI> and to render it infertile; but that this de&s;ign mi&s;carried by rea&s;on of the great difficulties in effecting the thing.</P>
<P>All the&s;e particulars, which I had already learned, when I pa&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Moka,</HI> from a dozen Merchants, that come there every year in the name of the King of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> to attend the <HI>Indian</HI> trading Ve&s;&s;els, are con&s;iderable to make us judg, that the <HI>Nile</HI> increa|&s;eth not but by the Rains which fall <HI>without Egypt</HI> towards the Source of that River: But the particular Ob&s;ervations, I have made upon two Increa&s;es of this River, make them yet more &s;o; for, in reference to all tho&s;e Stories, that are made of it, as, <HI>That</HI> 'tis on a determin'd day it begins to increa&s;e; <HI>that</HI> on the fir&s;t day of its increa&s;e there falls a certain Dew, which maketh the Plague cea&s;e, &s;o&punc; that no body dieth any more of it after that hath once fallen; and <HI>that</HI> there are peculiar and hidden cau&s;es of the overflowing of the <HI>Nile:</HI> In reference, I &s;ay, to the&s;e &s;tories, I have found during the &s;aid two Inundations, that they are but tales fancied and amplified by the people of <HI>Egypt,</HI> naturally inclin'd to &s;uper&s;tition, and amazed to &s;ee a River &s;well in &s;ummer in a Country where it rains not: And I have found, that 'tis no otherwi&s;e with the <HI>Nile</HI> than 'tis with other Rivers, that &s;well and overflow by plentiful Rains, without any &s;uch fermentations of the nitrous &s;oyl of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted as the cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>I have &s;een it &s;welled above a foot, and very turbid, near a whole month before that pretended determined day of its Increa&s;e. I have ob&s;erved during its increa&s;e, and before the Channels were open'd, that when it had grown for &s;ome days a foot or two, it afterwards decrea&s;ed little by little, and then began to increa&s;e a new, and &s;o went on to increa&s;e and decrea&s;e without any other mea&s;ure but that of the Rains that fall nigh the Source, and, as is often &s;een in our River <HI>Loire,</HI> according to the fall of more or le&s;s Rain in the Mountains whence it flows, and the days or half days of fair weather there.</P>
<P>In my return from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> going up from <HI>Damietta</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> I chanced to be upon the <HI>Nile</HI> about a month <HI>before</HI> the pretended day of the <HI>Dew</HI>-fall, and in the morning we were all wet of the Dew fallen in the night.</P>
<P>I have been in <HI>Ro&s;ette</HI> at &s;upper with <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bermon,</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul of our Nation, eight or ten days after this day of the <HI>Dew</HI>-fall, when three per&s;ons were &s;truck with the Plague, of whom their died two within eight days, and the third, which was <HI>M. de Bermon</HI> him&s;elf, had perhaps not e&s;caped, if I had not pierc'd his Plague-&s;ore; which pre&s;ently infected my &s;elf like other; &s;o that, if I had not forthwith taken &s;ome <HI>Butter of Antimony,</HI> I might have been as well as they, an Example of the little certainty there is in the Plague after the Dew; but this <HI>Emetic</HI> Medicine in the beginning of the Evil did wonders, and I kept but three or four days within doors; during which, I remem|ber, my <HI>Bedouin</HI> that &s;erv'd me made no &s;cruple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o drink, in my pre&s;ence, the remain|der of my broth, to encourage me, and from his principle of Prede&s;tination, to laugh at the fear we have of the Plague. Yet Experience &s;hews, that after the day of the Dew the Plague is commonly not &s;o dangerous as before, but the Dew contributes nothing to that; 'tis only in my opinion, that then there is a greater opening of the pores, which gives a vent to the malign and pe&s;tiferous &s;pirits, that were &s;hut up in the body.</P>
<P>Moreover, I have carefully enquired of &s;ome Ma&s;ters of Boats, that had gone up as far as the end of the Plains of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that is, to the very Rocks and Cataracts; who a&s;&s;ured me, that when the <HI>Nile</HI> did overflow in the Plains of <HI>Egypt,</HI> where that pre|tended fermenting Nitrous Earth is, 'tis at the &s;ame time much &s;welled between tho&s;e Mountains of the Cataracts, where, in all appearance there is no &s;uch Nitrous Earth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I have made diligent enquiry of tho&s;e <HI>Negro</HI>'s of <HI>Sonnars,</HI> that come to &s;erve at <HI>Cairo,</HI> and who&s;e Country, being tributary to the King of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> as I have &s;aid, lyes upon the <HI>Nile</HI> between the Mountains above <HI>Egypt;</HI> and they have a&s;&s;ured me, that at the &s;ame time when the <HI>Nile</HI> is high and overflowing in <HI>Egypt,</HI> 'tis &s;o al&s;o with them

<P>The Ob&s;ervations I have made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> concerning the regular Rains that fell at the &s;ame time when the <HI>Nile</HI> &s;wells in <HI>Egypt,</HI> are al&s;o very con&s;iderable in this mat|ter, and may make you imagine, that the <HI>Indus, Ganges,</HI> and all the other Rivers of tho&s;e parts are &s;o many <HI>Niles,</HI> and the Land, that is near their fall into the Sea, &s;o many <HI>Egypts.</HI> This was my thought of it in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and what follows are the very words I &s;et down about it.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter &s;ent from <HI>Chinas</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia, June</HI> 10^t^h 1668. To Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chapelle;</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning his De&s;ign of repairing again to his Studies, about &s;ome Points re|lating to the Doctrine of <HI>Atoms,</HI> and to the Nature of the <HI>Mind</HI> of Man.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did always believe what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luillier,</HI> &s;aid, That it would only be a Tran|&s;port of Youth, and that you would quit this kind of Life, &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ing to your Friends, and at length return to your Studies with more vigour than ever. I have been informed from <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> by the la&s;t Letters of my Friends, that you are now in good earne&s;t, and are going to take a flight with <HI>Democritus</HI> and <HI>Epicurus,</HI> far be|yond the flaming Walls of the world, into their infinite Spaces, to &s;ee and victoriou&s;ly to report unto us what <HI>may,</HI> and what <HI>may not</HI> be done,
<Q>Et ultra proce&s;&s;it long&egrave; flammantia, &amp;c.</Q>
to take a Review, and to fall <HI>upon</HI> a &s;erious meditation of the nature of tho&s;e Spaces, the general Place of things; <HI>upon</HI> tho&s;e infinite Generations and Corruptions of their pretended worlds by their alledged fatal Concour&s;e of Atoms; <HI>upon</HI> the Nature, Indi|vi&s;ibility, and other Proprieties of their Atoms; <HI>upon</HI> Liberty, Fortune and De&s;tiny; <HI>upon</HI> the Exi&s;tence, Unity, and Providence of God; <HI>upon</HI> the u&s;e of the Parts of Animals; <HI>upon</HI> the Soul, and all the other &s;ublime matters they have treated of.</P>
<P>For my part, I cannot condemn this De&s;ign, the inclination we have to know, being na|tural; on the contrary I am bound to believe, that it belongs but to great Souls to elevate them&s;elves to &s;uch high Enterprizes, in regard it is principally by this means, that a man can make appear what he is, and the advantage he hath above other Animals. But as the highe&s;t Undertakings are commonly al&s;o the mo&s;t dangerous, this certainly is not without much danger. For though we &s;eem to have a peculiar inclination and affecti|on to <HI>Truth;</HI> yet it &s;eems al&s;o, that we have another very &s;trong one to <HI>Liberty</HI> and In|dependency, not to acknowledge a Ma&s;ter above us, and to &s;ay, to believe and to do all according to our Phan&s;ie, without the fear of any, and without an obligation to render an account for any thing; &s;o that if we be not upon our Guard, this <HI>latter</HI> Inclination will carry away the Bell; and if we &s;tay upon the Rea&s;ons that carry us to this liberty, and content our &s;elves with &s;lightly con&s;idering tho&s;e that might take us off from it; we &s;hall &s;oon find our &s;elves engaged in a &s;trange life, or at lea&s;t be in &s;u&s;pence between both, and to&s;&s;ed up and down between a <HI>'Tmay be that this is &s;o,</HI> and <HI>'Tmay be that it is not &s;o;</HI> lukewarm, or cold, &s;low, and indifferent to what concerns the End and Rule of our life.</P>
<P>Moreover methinks, that mo&s;t Philo&s;ophers &s;uffer them&s;elves ea&s;ily to be carried a|way to this vanity of believing, that to entertain Opinions beyond the vulgar, is the way of being reputed Rare and Excellent Wits; they taking plea&s;ure even to vent &s;uch Opi|nions as &s;omething My&s;terious, belonging to none but men of great Knowledge, and grounded on deep and weighty Rea&s;ons; although they be not too much per&s;waded them&s;elves of what they affirm. So that if &s;uch men do not take great care on that hand al&s;o, they &s;hall not fail to be &s;eized on by the aforementioned vanity; and whil&s;t they go about to per&s;wade others of what they are not per&s;waded them&s;elves, they &s;hall in|&s;en&s;ibly fall into that very Belief; like a Liar, who after having often related one and the the &s;ame Untruth, or at la&s;t believes it to be a Truth; Or at lea&s;t they &s;hall in the end fall into tho&s;e unquietne&s;&s;es, may be's, and indifferencies, which I have mention'd in|&s;tead of attaining that &s;tate of &s;olid tranquility and &s;ublime knowledge, which they pro|mi&s;ed, and wherewith they flatter'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there is no doubt, that though we have this inclination to learn, yet we are withal very lazy; we de&s;ire indeed Knowledge and Truth, but we would have it very
<PB N="148" REF="409">
cheap, without much Labour and Watching, which are irk&s;ome things, and often di&s;turbing our health, yet nece&s;&s;ary evils if we will know <HI>thoroughly</HI> the lea&s;t thing, and make our &s;elves capable to give a &s;oild Judgment thereof. And thence it comes, that if we be not con&s;tantly upon our Guard, and contend not perpetually with our &s;lothful|ne&s;s, we &s;hall &s;oon come to flatter our &s;elves with this belief; That to know things, there needs not &s;o much painful &s;tudy; and &s;o not being to re&s;olve upon an unce&s;&s;ant Labour, we &s;uffer our &s;elves to be ea&s;ily &s;urprized with that <HI>Appearance</HI> of Truth, which &s;hineth forth in the Rea&s;ons commonly produced by the&s;e Gentlemen&punc; called <HI>les E&s;prits &s;orts;</HI> in&s;tead of &s;eriou&s;ly examining them&punc; that &s;o they may not be made to appear to us beyond what they contain of &s;trength, nor the force of tho&s;e that make again&s;t them be hid and di&s;guis'd; as often enough happens, either by ignorance or preventi|on, or el&s;e by the vanity and pre&s;umption of tho&s;e per&s;ons, that make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to dogmatize; or la&s;tly, by, I know not what, unhappy plea&s;ure we generally take in &s;uffering things to be exaggerated to us, or in evaggerating them our &s;elves, tending to nothing el&s;e, than plea&s;antly to deceive one another.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>my dear Friend&punc;</HI> to tell you freely my thoughts of your De&s;ign; methinks, that in Philo&s;ophy, and e&s;pecially in the &s;tudy of tho&s;e high matters which you undertake, there is no middle way: I mean, that <HI>either</HI> we mu&s;t, without &s;o much &s;ubliming our Wits, &s;uffer our &s;elves to be &s;weetly carried away by the Current, which &s;o many men of good &s;en&s;e, and that are reputed hone&s;t per&s;ons and good Philo&s;ophers, do follow (which to me &s;eems to be the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t, as well becau&s;e of the great Labour, this &s;tudy demands, as of the danger there is, that in Philo&s;ophizing but by halves, and not penetrating things to the bottom, we get nothing by the bargain but di&s;quieting Doubts, making us unhappy the re&s;t of our days, and leaving us often very vicious, and unea&s;ie to Society;) <HI>Or</HI> el&s;e, if we will Philo&s;ophize, to do it to purpo&s;e, and that, without fearing the labour, and without &s;uffering our &s;elves to be &s;urprized by the vanity of coveting to pa&s;s for extraordinary Wits, as al&s;o without &s;uffering our &s;elves to be carried away by that unhappy inclination of de&s;iring to live without a Ma&s;ter and a Law; that, I &s;ay, without the&s;e, we fall re&s;olutely upon the &s;tudy, and from a pure love to Truth, we become ob&s;tinate in weighing and weighing again all that comes be|fore us, in meditating, writing, conver&s;ing, debating; in a word, in forgetting no|thing of what may contribute to improve our under&s;tanding, and to render it more intelligent.</P>
<P>As to what at pre&s;ent you demand of me by your la&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that I &s;hould impart to you what came into my thoughts when I was di&s;cour&s;ing with our <HI>Danechmend-kan,</HI> the Learned Gentleman of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> about all tho&s;e matters, you are now applying your Stu|dies to: I &s;hall tell you freely, and without flattering my &s;elf, that you might addre&s;s your &s;elf to a more intelligent per&s;on than me, but to none, that hath &s;tudied them with more care, then I have done. For I have not only contented my &s;elf, exactly to weigh the rea&s;ons of all that ever I could come to &s;ee of both Ancient and Modern Authors, <HI>Arabians</HI> al&s;o, and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> but I have farther conferr'd an hundred times with whatever great men I could any where meet with, &s;o far as that I have often fain'd, when I was with tho&s;e <HI>E&s;prits &s;orts,</HI> as they will be call'd, that I was not aver&s;e from their Sentiments, to the end that they might conceal nothing from me. But that being a thing of great prolixity, it will be better, &s;ince you are now on the way to re|turn into <HI>Europe,</HI> to refer that matter to our Meeting there, when we &s;hall be able by word of mouth better and more conveniently to declare our thoughts to one ano|ther. Yet notwith&s;tanding, that I may not &s;eem to be carele&s;s of your de&s;ire, I &s;hall in the mean time tell you thus much of the nature of our Under&s;tanding, <HI>That it &s;eems to me very rational to believe, that there is &s;omething in us more perfect and excellent, than all that which we call Body or Matter.</HI></P>
<P>You know, according to the <HI>Idea</HI> that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> hath given us of the <HI>Fir&s;t Matter</HI> of things, that nothing can be imagin'd &s;o imperfect, as it. For, in &s;hort, to be nothing but a certain <HI>Neque quantum, neque quale,</HI> is, methinks, to approach to a Nothing as near as may be. You know al&s;o, that all the perfections and proprieties, which <HI>De|mocritus</HI> and <HI>Epicurus</HI> attribute to their Primitive Bodies, or to the fir&s;t and &s;ole Matter of things, comes in a manner to this, that there are certain &s;mall and very &s;olid Beings, without any vacuity in them, and indivi&s;ible; all having &s;ome particular and e&s;&s;ential figure, &s;o that there is an infinite number of round ones, (for example) an infinity of Pyramidal, an infinity of Square, and infinity of Cubick, Hooked, Pointed, Trian|gular
<PB N="149" REF="409">
ones; and &s;o an innumerable number of other kinds of different Figures; all moveable of their own nature, and of an unimaginable Celerity; yet &s;ome of them more proper for the &s;en&s;ible motion of Concretions than others, that is to &s;ay, for di&s;|engaging and &s;eparating them&s;elves, or for flying &s;ooner and more ea&s;ily away than others in the di&s;&s;olution of Compounds, according as they are more or le&s;s &s;mall, or more or le&s;s round, or more or le&s;s poli&s;h'd and &s;lippery: And la&s;tly, that they are all eternal by their nature, and con&s;equently all incorruptible and independent (as they pretend;) though they be without any &s;en&s;e, rea&s;on and judgment. You know, I &s;ay, that all the Proprieties of their little Bodies come, very near, to what I have now &s;aid; of which I de&s;ire you to be mindful, that &s;o we may hereafter judge, whether they be capable of what is a&s;cribed to them.</P>
<P>Yet, to take nothing from the force of their Principles, and to undeceive you; if you believe, I have ca&s;t off Atoms, I &s;hall avow to you frankly, that the more I con&s;ider that <HI>Divi&s;ion to Infinity</HI> of any portion of <HI>Finite</HI> matter, the more ab&s;urd and unworthy of a Philo&s;opher it &s;eems to me: and I believe the Rea&s;ons, which are alledged to prove it, to be as captious as tho&s;e, which <HI>Zeno,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing this &s;ame divi&s;ibility, brought to prove, that there was no motion &s;ince Mathematical Points, Lines and Superficies, which have no being but by the Under&s;tanding, and are without profundity, ought not to be transferr'd and applied to Bodies Phy&s;ical, which cannot be without all the dimen&s;ions, and are the workman&s;hip of Nature: To which add, that a Philo&s;opher ought to a|void, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, to dive into <HI>Infinity,</HI> that being a deep and dark Aby&s;s, which often &s;erveth men for nothing el&s;e but to hide them&s;elves, and in which the wit of man is at a perfect lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Moreover, I acknowledge, I am &s;till of that opinion, <HI>not only,</HI> that Atoms are indi|vi&s;ible, becau&s;e they are little portions of Matter, or little hard Bodies, re&s;i&s;ting and inpenetrable (proprieties as e&s;&s;ential to Matter, as Exten&s;ion) and becau&s;e they are pure, matter continued, without any parts that are only contiguous, and of which each hath its particular and determinate Superfice; <HI>but</HI> al&s;o that the &s;eparation, disjunction or di&s;|&s;ociation of parts meerly contiguous in a compound, is, in my judgment, the only divi|&s;ion conceivable: &s;o that 'tis not po&s;&s;ible, not only to divide any Atome, that is, any por|tion of matter purely continuous, though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it as long as a Needle, &s;ince that to divide it with Sci&s;&s;ers; for example, or otherwi&s;e, you mu&s;t come to &s;ome pe|netration, which is inconceivable to us; and that it mu&s;t needs be, that &s;omething of the Needle, &s;ome portion or &s;ome part (if it may be &s;aid, that there are parts in a whole, where there are no contiguous ones) do yield, and yet that tis inconceivable, how it were able to yield to the Sci&s;&s;ers that &s;hould pre&s;s it, or to make other, anteriour ones, yield without penetration; and that the more, becau&s;e the parts pre&s;&s;ed, and the part of the Sci&s;&s;ers that &s;hould pre&s;s, are both of them of the &s;ame Nature and the &s;ame force, both hard, re&s;i&s;ting and impenetrable. So that the Doctrine of Atoms hath this great advantage, that it doth not &s;o much as <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> its Principles, by deman|ding to grant out of meer favour the <HI>Indivi&s;ibility</HI> of the Primitive Bodies; fora&s;much as it even cannot be <HI>conceived</HI> that they are divi&s;ible; nor, how out of &s;oft, yielding and divi&s;ible Principles there &s;hould re&s;ult a Compound that's hard; nor, how two mo&s;t &s;ubtil portions of Matter, coming to hit one again&s;t another, &s;hould not re&s;i&s;t each other by their hardne&s;s, without reducing them&s;elves into &s;ome du&s;t of &s;maller Particles. Be&s;ides, this Doctrine demands not, to have it granted out of meer Grace, that there mu&s;t be little void &s;paces betwixt the parts of Bodies compounded, how &s;ubtil &s;oever you may devi&s;e a matter to fill them up; &s;eeing it is likewi&s;e unconceivable, not only how a motion &s;hould be able to begin in <HI>pleno</HI> (where all is perfectly full) but how the parts them&s;elves of this mo&s;t &s;ubtil matter, that mu&s;t have their particular figures defin'd and determin'd as well as the bigger, can be &s;o perfectly di&s;po&s;ed as that there &s;hould not &s;till remain &s;ome of tho&s;e little Spaces betwixt them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall further acknowledge to you, that I think, it may, in the Atomical way of Philo&s;ophizing, be very well and very rationally conceived, that there is no compound of &s;o admirable a figure, compo&s;ition, order and texture of parts, taking in the Body of Man it &s;elf, but that it may be formed by the concour&s;e, order and particular di&s;po|&s;ition of their little Bodies, the Atoms, provided there intervenes a guiding and regu|lating cau&s;e, intelligent enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall likewi&s;e confe&s;s, that from <HI>their</HI> Principles there might re&s;ult a Compound &s;o perfect, as to be capable of the mo&s;t difficult Local Motions that could be imagin'd, &s;uch
<PB N="150" REF="410">
as are, To walk like a Living and Animal Sub&s;tance; as al&s;o, perfectly to imitate the &s;inging, weeping, and all the other local motions of the mo&s;t perfect Animals; there being no contradiction at all in it, all Watches and &s;o many other artificial Engines e|vincing it, and not &s;uffering us to doubt of the po&s;&s;ibility of the thing.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I &s;hall very willingly agree, that the Sect of <HI>Democritus</HI> and <HI>Epicurus,</HI> (it being &s;uppos'd, that the Atoms are the workman&s;hip of the Almighty and All-wi&s;e hand of God,) hath very great advantages above the re&s;t, in that it can give a more probable rea&s;on of a great number of con&s;iderable effects of Nature, where others come &s;hort; and in my opinion, there are none but &s;uch as have not examined things thoroughly, and compar'd other Sects with it, that can doubt thereof. But to imagine and to per&s;wade my &s;elf, that their Principles, with all tho&s;e advantages, at length are capable, as they would have it, by a particular concour&s;e, order, union and di&s;po&s;ition, how admirable &s;oever, and even by an intelligent guidance intervening, to arrive to the forming of &s;uch an Animal as is Man in his operations; This is that, <HI>my dear Friend,</HI> which I could never think po&s;&s;ible; it hath ever appeared to me contrary to Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, and will doubtle&s;s, appear &s;o to you, provided you have the patience to recollect what you have heard and hundred times, and which I am now going to repeat to you after my own way.</P>
<P>It is not that I mean to preach to you, and to make you believe I am become a very good man after my return (a Traveller like my &s;elf, and brought up in the School of Atoms, might po&s;&s;ibly do Miracles, which I know not whether men would believe any thing of;) Be per&s;waded, that if I take upon me to di&s;cour&s;e to you, it is not out of any vanity or affectation, but from my inmo&s;t &s;en&s;e, and with all po&s;&s;ible &s;incerity. Nor is it, that I pretend, with all this <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Preamble, to have found any new Rea&s;ons in the <HI>Indies;</HI> expect no &s;uch thing, I pray: I do almo&s;t de&s;pair as well as <HI>Cicero,</HI> that men &s;hould ever find any thing more upon this Subject beyond what hath been already found. It would be no hard task for me to &s;hew, that all what the Mo|derns have &s;aid concerning it, is either nothing, or nothing new; There would need no more, than to begin with taking up again, what <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> and <HI>Arnault</HI> have written about it again&s;t <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> to which I find not, that he hath made any An&s;wer: And it were to be wi&s;hed, that he had been able to an&s;wer them &s;o demon&s;tratively and magi&s;terially, as it &s;eems he would have men believe he did: I &s;hould embrace, and little le&s;s than adore the Author of a Demon&s;tration upon this Argument; and to &s;uch an one the following Ver&s;es would be much more de&s;ervedly applicable, than to that ancient Atomi&s;t;

I &s;hall therefore de&s;ire but one thing of you, which is, That you would plea&s;e to make (which &s;eems to me the only thing to be done here) a &s;erious reflection upon what pa&s;&s;eth <HI>within</HI> us, and upon the operations of our Under&s;tanding; and that thereupon you would tell me &s;incerely, Whether you think, that there is a proportion between the perfection of tho&s;e operations, and the imperfection of what we call Body or Mat|ter; &s;uppo&s;ing (what you will ea&s;ily grant me) that how much &s;oever you &s;train your mind, you &s;hall never conceive any other thing in Atoms, and generally in all that's Body or Matter, than tho&s;e proprieties already enumerated, Size, Shape, Hardne&s;s, Indivi&s;ibility, Motion; or, if you will (which matters not here) Softne&s;s and Divi&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>I promi&s;e my &s;elf, that you will readily grant me this Reque&s;t, which is, to go over again tho&s;e ingenious and agreeable thoughts of yours, that have been drawn out of your <HI>Memories;</HI> and tho&s;e many other Fragments of the &s;ame force of Wit, that have been left behind, and generally all tho&s;e other Poetical Tran&s;ports and Raptures of your <HI>Homer, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> which &s;eem to have &s;omething of Divine in them: And you will not refu&s;e in that &s;erenity of mind and Philo&s;ophical temper, wherein &s;ometimes you are in the Morning, to make &s;ome reflection upon four or five things, that &s;eem to me to de&s;erve very well the attention of a Philo&s;opher. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, That our Sen&s;es are not only &s;truck by Bodies &s;o, as the Eyes of a Statue or an <HI>Automaton,</HI> but that we feel their impre&s;&s;ion, the titillation and pain, and that even we perceive
<PB N="151" REF="410">
that we feel, when we &s;ay, I perceive that this or that plea&s;eth my ta&s;te much more or much le&s;s than ordinarily; that my pain is much le&s;s or much more than it was; and &s;o of an hundred things el&s;e. The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That often we &s;tay not there, but deduce the&s;e <HI>particular</HI> Conclu&s;ions; We ought therefore to follow this; or we ought to &s;hun that: And afterwards, the&s;e <HI>general</HI> ones; All what is good, is to be followed; and all what is evil, is to be avoided. The <HI>third,</HI> That we remember what is pa&s;&s;ed, and con&s;ider what is pre&s;ent, and fore-&s;ee what is to come. The <HI>fourth,</HI> That &s;ometimes we endeavour to penetrate into our &s;elves, into that which is inmo&s;t in us, as I now do, when I am &s;earching what I am; what is this Rea&s;oning power that is within me; what are the&s;e thoughts; the&s;e ratiocinations, and the&s;e reflections I make, reflecting thus upon my &s;elf and my Operations. The <HI>fifth,</HI> That being re&s;olutely &s;et to meditate upon a thing, we &s;ometimes make new Di&s;coveries, find new Rea&s;ons, or at lea&s;t &s;ee tho&s;e that have been found already, weighing them, and comparing one with another, and &s;ometimes drawing thence &s;uch Con&s;equences, as &s;hall depend from a greater num|ber of antecedent Propo&s;itions, which may be &s;een as 'twere in one view, and concur all to deduce &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion; as it comes to pa&s;s in all Sciences, e&s;pecially the Ma|thematicks; wherein our Spirit &s;hews I know not what force and admirable extent.</P>
<P>The&s;e few reflections might &s;uffice for what I demand of you; and that the rather, becau&s;e as I can &s;ay more comes almo&s;t to the &s;ame thing. But you mu&s;t re&s;olve for once to endure the Style of the&s;e Countreys of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Air of which I have breathed &s;o long, and to have the patience further to ca&s;t your Eyes on a thing that &s;eems to me very con&s;iderable, which is, That we know not only particular things that make impre&s;&s;ion upon our Sen&s;es, but that our Under&s;tanding, by I know not what admirable force and ca|pacity, taketh occa&s;ion to know and to form to it &s;elf <HI>Idea's</HI> of a thou&s;and things, that fall not immediately and wholly as they are under the Sen&s;es; for example, that Man is a Rea&s;onable Animal; that the Sun is much bigger than the whole Earth; that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, one thing &s;hould be at the &s;ame time and not be; that two things, being e|qual to a third, are equal among them&s;elves; that the ab&s;ence of the Sun cau&s;eth the Night, that all what's generated is &s;ubject to corruption; that of nothing nothing can be natu|rally made; as not any thing that is, can naturally return to nothing; that of nece&s;|&s;ity there is &s;omething Eternal and Un-created in the Univer&s;e, God, or the fir&s;t Mat|ter of things, or both, or that God created this Matter, and that <HI>either</HI> from all Eter|nity <HI>or</HI> in Time: And an infinity more of other great and va&s;t thoughts, and remote from Matter, of which we &s;carce know by what door they have entred into our Mind.</P>
<P>Now, all the&s;e actions, I have been &s;peaking of, that argue &s;o great a force and pow|er, capacity and extent of the <HI>Mind</HI> of Man; all tho&s;e intern Motions; that peculiar State which we cannot perfectly explain, but yet plainly feel and perceive in our &s;elves, when we attentively reflect on what pa&s;&s;eth within us, and con&s;ider our operations; All tho&s;e Actions, I &s;ay, and interiour Motions, or whatever you will call them, can they indeed to be a&s;cribed to Spirits, to a Wind, to Fire, to Air, to Atoms, to Particles of a Subtil Matter, and, in a word, to any thing that hath no other Qualities or Propri|eties than what can be comprized under this word, <HI>Body,</HI> how &s;mall and fine and nim|ble &s;oever it may be, into what texture or di&s;po&s;ition &s;oever it may be ca&s;t, and of what motions &s;oever it may be made capable? It cannot: we &s;hall never be able to imagine that the&s;e things are meer Local Motions of &s;ome Engine barely Artificial, dead, in&s;en&s;i|ble, without Judgment, without Rea&s;on: The&s;e can never be any of tho&s;e inward actions I have mention'd, as, That I &s;ee or know that I know; that I &s;ee I rea&s;on; that I &s;ee tho&s;e rea&s;onings, and perceive that I &s;ee them.</P>
<P>Moreover, let us a little ca&s;t our Eyes upon &s;ome of the main Propo&s;itions of <HI>Euclid,</HI> (not to &s;peak of tho&s;e of <HI>Archimedes, Apollonius,</HI> and &s;o many others;) For my part, when I think only on the 47<HI>th.</HI> of the 1&s;t. of <HI>Euclid,</HI> I there find &s;omething &s;o great and noble, that I avow to you, I can hardly believe that it was an <HI>Humane</HI> Invention: So that I &s;hould imagine, that it was therefore that <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> after he had been &s;o hap|py as to find this incomparable Propo&s;ition, was &s;o ravi&s;hed and tran&s;ported, that he made that famous Sacrifice to thank the <HI>Gods,</HI> and had a mind to declare thereby, that this Invention &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the reach of an <HI>Humane</HI> Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Yet I would not therefore &s;ay, that there is rea&s;on to believe, that in Man there is a particle of Divinity, or &s;ome &s;uch thing. This is an unrea&s;onable Tenet of &s;ome <HI>Stoicks,</HI> and of the <HI>Cabali&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and of the <HI>Brachmans</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> who, to acknow|ledge
<PB N="152" REF="411">
openly the Noblene&s;s and Perfection of the Spirit of Man, cho&s;e rather to ca&s;t them&s;elves into this extremity, than to believe it to be &s;o ba&s;e and imperfect, as to be all Body and Matter. I am far from entertaining &s;uch a Sentiment; you will &s;ee in the Letter to Moun&s;ieur <HI>Chapelain,</HI> that I cannot believe this to be an opinion defen&s;ible by a Philo&s;opher: But this I do, I ob&s;erve in Man, as well as tho&s;e <HI>Stoicks</HI> and others, &s;omething &s;o perfect, &s;o great and high, that <HI>their</HI> opinion &s;eems to me an hundred times le&s;s ab&s;urd, than that, which holds that in Man, and even in the whole Univer&s;e, there is nothing but <HI>Body,</HI> but bodily and local Motions, but Atoms, but Matter.</P>
<P>Lord! When I think on't, who is that man, how little of good &s;en&s;e &s;oever he may have, that can per&s;wade him&s;elf, that when an <HI>Archimedes,</HI> a <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and others of tho&s;e great men, had tho&s;e effects of the Mind, and were in their deep Meditations, there was then nothing in their Heads and Brains but what was Corporeal, nothing but Vital and Animal Spirits, nothing but a certain Natural Heat, nothing but Particles of a very &s;ubtil Matter, or nothing but Atoms, which, though they be In&s;en&s;ible, and without all Under&s;tanding and Rea&s;on, and do not &s;o much, (according to the Do|ctrine of the Atomi&s;ts,) as move but by a fatal and blind motion and hit, &s;hould yet come to move and concur &s;o luckily and wonderfully, that, as once by &s;uch a concour&s;e they had formed the Head of tho&s;e Great men, &s;uch as it is with tho&s;e innumerable Organs &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly order'd and di&s;pos'd; &s;o al&s;o they &s;hould then be &s;o lucky as to form and produce tho&s;e &s;ubtil thoughts, and profound meditations; or rather that they &s;hould come to move them&s;elves in all tho&s;e Organs in &s;o wonderful a manner, as at la&s;t to fall into a certain Order and into a certain Di&s;po&s;ition and State, &s;o marvellous, that they them&s;elves were that Conceiving, Seeing, Meditating, tho&s;e admirable Pro|po&s;itions, and tho&s;e Divine Inventions?</P>
<P>Add to this, when we find our &s;elves, upon &s;ome Affront, or other Di&s;plea&s;ure re|ceived, ready to fall into Choler and Rage, and yet &s;top our Pa&s;&s;ion; I pray, this in|ternal Commander and Command, which we feel, this kind of Obedience, of modera|tion and retreat, that is made, for example, upon the account of &s;ome con&s;ideration of Hone&s;ty, of Honour and Virtue, and again&s;t that natural Inclination we have to be re|venged; what is that interiour motion and &s;tate? Can it be rationally &s;aid, that 'tis nothing but &s;ome Rollings, Counter-motions, Reflections, and peculiar conjunctions and textures of Atoms or Spirits, or of little Ma&s;&s;es or Particles of Matter, which are made within tho&s;e Nerves, tho&s;e fine Membranes, tho&s;e very &s;ubtil Channels and Or|gans of the Brain, Heart, and other parts of the Body? The&s;e are pure <HI>Chimera</HI>'s.</P>
<P>A word more concerning <HI>Liberty:</HI> When in the apprehen&s;ion of taking an <HI>ill</HI> part for a <HI>good,</HI> we keep our &s;elves in a poy&s;e, &s;eeking within our &s;elves all the rea&s;ons that are <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t,</HI> and &s;eriou&s;ly pondering and examining them; this apprehen&s;ion, this re&s;earch, this ballancing, and the re&s;olution we at la&s;t take to do or not to do the thing; all that, all tho&s;e motions, all that inward &s;tate and way of Being (I &s;peak in no other terms than they) &s;hall it be nothing but a fortuitous and blind concour&s;e of little Bodies? Is't po&s;&s;ible that you can imagine or per&s;wade your &s;elf this? <HI>Lucrece</HI> him&s;elf, that &s;worn Parti&s;an of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect, could not do it, nor re&s;olve to attribute to Atoms alone tho&s;e free motions of the Will. For if the Will, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> is drawn away from fatality, and rai&s;ed above De&s;tiny, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fatis avul&s;a voluntas,</HI> &amp;c. How can he, with all his <HI>clinamen</HI> or devi|ation of Principles, have believed in good earne&s;t and without &s;cruple, that there is no|thing but <HI>Body,</HI> and nothing done in us, more than el&s;ewhere, but by a natural, eternal, independent, immutable and inevitable concour&s;e of Atoms? He was not ignorant, that that being &s;o, neither the Will, nor any other thing what&s;oever could be drawn and exempted from that concatenation and eternal and inmmutable Sequel of Motions and Cau&s;es, that would follow and &s;ucceed one another by eternal Orders ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and unchangeable.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, I could put you in mind of many Rea&s;ons that are wont to be al|ledged upon this Subject. You know that great man, who hath collected more of them than a &s;core of very good ones. But that would be to abu&s;e your Patience too much&punc; and be&s;ides I &s;ee not, that there is much more of any importance to be con&s;idered hereupon, than what I have lately repre&s;ented unto you.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o tell you, how I judge that all Objections, made upon this point, may be mo&s;t rationally an&s;wer'd; but I know, that you are not a per&s;on, for whom Books are to be made. I &s;hall only mention two things to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, That 'tis true what they &s;ay, That Eating, Drinking, Health; Natural
<PB N="153" REF="411">
Heat, the Spirits, and a good Di&s;po&s;ition of Organs, (all which are natural things, and as they &s;peak, depending from Atoms as Principles and the fir&s;t Matter) are things ne|ce&s;&s;ary to all tho&s;e Thoughts, Rea&s;onings and Reflections; and, in a word, to all tho&s;e Internal Operations I have mentioned. This is a thing that cannot be denied, and which every one doth too &s;en&s;ibly experiment not to aver it: But thence to conclude, that what&s;oever intervenes and concurs to form tho&s;e Operations, is only and meerly Body, Atoms, Spirits, Subtil Matter, is that which, after the lea&s;t Reflection made upon <HI>their</HI> Excellency, and upon the imperfection of Bodies or Atoms, or upon the little re|&s;emblance there is in <HI>their</HI> Qualities to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> Operations, can never with any good &s;en&s;e be granted: So that, methinks the mo&s;t that might be allow'd, would be, that the Atoms, and Spirits, and all tho&s;e other things alledged, are indeed nece&s;&s;ary as condi|tions or di&s;po&s;itions, or the like, and not as the fir&s;t and ab&s;olute Principles, and as the <HI>Total</HI> cau&s;e of the Operations; but that there is requi&s;ite &s;ome other thing than all that, &s;omething nobler, higher, and more perfect.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing is, That 'tis true al&s;o, that we cannot form a right, or, as they &s;peak, a next and po&s;itive <HI>Idea</HI> of what is <HI>above</HI> a <HI>Body</HI> or of any thing that is <HI>not Body:</HI> This, indeed, we cannot do, in my opinion, whil&s;t we are in this mortal &s;tate &s;o &s;trict|ly united to the Body; the dependance of the Bodily Sen&s;es, that &s;o much confine and ob&s;cure the light of our Under&s;tanding, hinders us from it: But I &s;ee not that thence it is to be concluded, that therefore there is really nothing <HI>above</HI> Body, or Atoms, or Matter. For, how many things are there, of which we have no &s;uch po&s;itive <HI>Idea,</HI> which yet Rea&s;on obligeth us to avow that they have a real Being? Or rather, how few things are there, of which we have any True <HI>Idea's?</HI> Have the&s;e Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves any po&s;itive <HI>Idea</HI> of their Atoms? They acknowledge that their &s;malne&s;s is &s;uch, that it cannot be &s;o much as imagin'd by hearing this word <HI>Atom</HI> pronounc'd or explain'd: &s;o far are they from being capable to fall under our &s;en&s;es, and from im|printing in us a true and po&s;itive <HI>Idea;</HI> and yet notwith&s;tanding they believe, and conclude from Rea&s;on, that they <HI>are.</HI> A Mathematician, hath he the po&s;itive <HI>Idea</HI> of the Magnitude of the Sun? It is &s;o prodigious, and &s;o far remote from the capacity of the Sen&s;es, that we are not able even &s;o much as to imagine it &s;uch as it is; and yet for all this, there is none that is not fully per&s;waded and convinced thereof by the force of Demon&s;trations, and that knows not perfectly, that he exceeds by far the bigne&s;s of the Globe of the Earth. And be&s;ides, it is not true, that the nature of a thing may be known two manner of ways; either <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> as when it falls under &s;ome one or more of our Sen&s;es, or as when we give a po&s;itive Definition thereof; or <HI>negatively,</HI> by &s;aying what it is not: Now I &s;hall grant, that we are not capable to know the Principle of our Operations or Ratiocinations by the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> way, to &s;ay what it is, and how tho&s;e Operations are made and produced. Alas! we are not &s;o happy; we &s;hould need other Sen&s;es far more perfect than all tho&s;e we have. We are not born to dive and Philo&s;o|phize &s;o far:
<Q>Invida praeclu&s;it &s;peciem natura videndi.</Q>
But we ought al&s;o to acknowledge, that at lea&s;t we are capable to know it after the <HI>&s;econd</HI> way: So that, if we cannot &s;ay truly and po&s;itively what it is, we can at lea&s;t &s;ay, and certainly know what it is not: I mean, that from the perfection of the Opera|tions, which we do evidently &s;ee to be &s;uch as that they have no proportion with all tho&s;e proprieties and perfections of Atoms, and do univer&s;ally &s;urpa&s;s the reach of what is meerly Body; we can deduce a certain Conclu&s;ion, that the Principle of &s;uch Operations, and tho&s;e Operations them&s;elves mu&s;t needs be &s;omething above all that's Body or Corporeal. Which is here &s;ufficient for me, who at the beginning engaged my &s;elf no further, and pretend not, that we can make a true and po&s;itive <HI>Idea</HI> of that Principle; but only that we can and ought to conclude by Ratiocination, that there mu&s;t needs be &s;omething, as hath been &s;aid, that is far more perfect and far more noble than all that is in the rank of Bodies, whatever its being or Nature may be.</P>
<P>But &s;hall I make an end, fully to di&s;cover unto you my thought? You well know, whether I am a per&s;on that taketh plea&s;ure in vaunting, or in forging Untruths, or to &s;peak things at random in a matter &s;o important as this. It cannot be denied, that there is a very great difference between the Operations of Brutes, and tho&s;e admirable Operations of Man, of which we now treat: I &s;peak not only in re&s;pectof tho&s;e of their
<PB N="154" REF="412">
outward &s;en&s;es, but al&s;o in reference to tho&s;e of their inward ones, or their Imagina|tion. All that is &s;o much beneath the Rea&s;oning of man, that we mu&s;t avow, there is not any proportion, and that tho&s;e of Man proceed from a very differing and infinitely more perfect Principle. Notwith&s;tanding all that (and this is the thought I would declare to you) I &s;hould think that per&s;on an hundred times le&s;s ab&s;urd, that &s;hould go about to maintain, that in the Principle of tho&s;e Operations of Brutes, whether it be of their internal or even their external Sen&s;es, there were &s;omewhat more perfect than Corporeity and all that may be under&s;tood and comprehended under the name of Body, or Matter, or Spirits; than him, that &s;hould pretend the Principle of the Operations of Man were meerly Corporeal: So much do I take this Opinion to be out of all rea&s;on, and unworthy of a man of good Judgment. Certainly it can be no &s;erious Philo&s;o|phy; it can be nothing but an Exce&s;s of Vanity, that hath ca&s;t tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, we have &s;poken of, into &s;uch an irrational Extream. They doubtle&s;s &s;aw, that their Sect had great Advantages above all the re&s;t, in being able to explain with much Ea&s;e and Probability abundance of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Effects of Nature, only by Local Moti|on, and the Order and particular Di&s;po&s;ition of their Matter, Corpu&s;cles or Atoms: And thence they would make us believe, that by the &s;ame Principles they could give an account of all, and explicate whatever concerns the Spirit of Man, and the Operations thereof.</P>
<P>My <HI>Dear Friend,</HI> have not you and I concluded an hundred times, that how much &s;oever we &s;train'd our Under&s;tanding, we could never conceive, how from <HI>In&s;en&s;ible</HI> Corpu&s;eles there could ever re&s;ult any thing <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> without the intervention of any thing but what's <HI>in&s;en&s;ible;</HI> and that with all their Atoms, how &s;mall and how nimble &s;oever they make them, what motions and figures &s;oever they give them, and in what order, mixture or di&s;po&s;ition they range them, yea and whatever indu&s;trious hand they a&s;&s;ign them for guidance, they would never be able (&s;till &s;uppo&s;ing with them, that they have no other proprieties or perfections than tho&s;e recited) to make us imagine, how thence could re&s;ult a Compound, I &s;ay not, that &s;hould be <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> like Man, but that &s;hould be meerly <HI>Sen&s;itive,</HI> &s;uch as may be the vile&s;t and the mo&s;t imperfect Worm on Earth. How then dare they pretend, that they will make it out, how thence can re&s;ult a thing Imagining, a thing Rea&s;oning, and &s;uch an one as &s;hall be the Imagina|tions and Ratiocinations them&s;elves?</P>
<P>For my part, if you'l believe me, let us lay a&s;ide all that pre&s;umption and vanity of tho&s;e <HI>E&s;prits forts;</HI> let us not pretend to be able to explicate the nature of the Princi|ple of our Rea&s;onings in the &s;ame manner, as we might do the other things that fall under our Sen&s;es, and let us not play the Geometers upon it. We are not, as I have already &s;aid, happy enough for that; 'tis a thing which cannot be done in this mortal &s;tate, and in this great dependance from the corporeal &s;en&s;es in which we &s;tand. Yet notwith&s;tanding we ought to form a higher <HI>Idea</HI> of our &s;elves, and not to make our Soul to be of &s;uch ba&s;e alloy, as tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, too corporeal in this point, would have us do. We ought to believe for certain, that we are infinitely more noble and more perfect than they make us, and re&s;olutely maintain, that though we cannot ex|actly know what we are, yet we know very well and very certainly, what we are not; which is, that we are not altogether of Mire and Dirt, as they pretend. <HI>Farewel.</HI></P>

<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> He from his Youth had a &s;trong Inclination to Travel, which &s;ecret In&s;tinct is certainly a Preordina|tion of God for an Undertaking; and this un&s;een Impul|&s;ion carries &s;uch extraordinary In&s;truments chearfully and pro&s;perou&s;ly through all the Difficulties, others of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition would never wade thorough, for whom it would be in vain to &s;trive again&s;t the current of Nature.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> This Travelling <HI>Genius</HI> made him begin early to fit him&s;elf for his de&s;ign, and &s;oon to go about it. He was therefore &s;ufficiently imbued in his Intellectuals with all due knowledge of Sciences, Language, and Geogra|phy, and precedent Travellers Maps and Books, with|out all which common Travellers cannot conceive &s;o &s;oon and &s;o orderly, nor reap &s;o much benefit for them&s;elves or others.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> But Speculations without Experience are but un|profitable Notions; and the Experiments of this kind are not to be had without <HI>great Means and Ex|pence,</HI> for want of which many a good Undertaking is Still-born.

<PB REF="414" MS="y">
is an old and true Saying. But our noble <HI>Tavernier</HI> had an ample E&s;tate, drove a great Trade, had Money in abundance, and a Prince's or Emba&s;&s;ador-like Reti|nue, without which and great Pre&s;ents none is &s;carce look'd upon in Luxurious <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> fit for admittance in|to great and worthy Companies, where Knowledge may be attained; &s;o that he thereby &s;oon got into the Pre|&s;ence, Familiarity, and Clo&s;ets of the Emperours, the Mini&s;ters of State, and the Philo&s;ophers of <HI>Per&s;ia, Mogol,</HI> &amp;c. and got into the Acquaintance and Con|ver&s;ations of the leading and common Merchants, Traf|fiquers, and People; and knew their Languages very well: for it is in vain to have Eyes, if one have not al&s;o a Tongue in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> And whereas Learning and Riches do &s;ometimes render narrow Souls of a more proud and un&s;ociable temper, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> is by Nature and Edu|cation, and obliging, cheerful, and in&s;inuating Travel|ler, and of a graceful Countenance. Comely Per&s;onages are beloved almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are &s;een; and tho&s;e that have but fair Souls, are not &s;o till after they are known. Now Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> having both the&s;e Advantages, had a free entrance into the Friend&s;hip and Notions the <HI>Indians</HI> (great or &s;mall) had con|cerning the Natural, Mechanical, Political, Religi|ous, and Trading State of their own Countrey; which he made more his bu&s;ine&s;s to know, than to grow more rich.
<PB REF="414">
And at &s;ome times he would reckon Thou&s;ands of Pounds as nothing to attain his ends in this point of Knowledge and further Experience; as the peru&s;al of this his own Work, and Per&s;ons now in <HI>London,</HI> that knew him in and after his Travels, can fully te&s;tifie.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Moreover, Mutual Help of Per&s;ons equally un|der&s;tanding and curious, is a great advantage in &s;uch Re&s;earches and Ob&s;ervations as the&s;e. Now <HI>John Bapti&s;ta Tavernier,</HI> be&s;ides many other Heads and Hands, had herein the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Brother, as com|plete a Traveller as him&s;elf in tho&s;e furthe&s;t Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and had no le&s;s the foregoing Qualifications in Per&s;on and E&s;tate than this his Brother <HI>John Bap|ti&s;ta</HI> had, as the Reader may well perceive by this Vo|lum of Travels.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> And as for the <HI>Time;</HI> Six Voyages, and about Forty Years Abode in tho&s;e Countries they do de&s;cribe, did render the&s;e Brethrens Knowledge va&s;t, their Ex|periments tried over and over, and this their Account more &s;ure and exact (as I &s;aid) than that of any other Traveller heretofore.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> And finally, to confirm the undoubted Credit that's to be given to this Nobleman and his Relation, (who is above all de&s;ign of Flattering or Deceiving the Reader) you may meet with &s;everal Worthy Per&s;ons in this City and the Court of <HI>England;</HI> and I my &s;elf, who was at <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ome few years ago at Mon&s;ieur

The&s;e (I &s;ay) Public and Private Te&s;timonials do &s;hew what Credit other Nations and his own (which is Singular) had given to him.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Di&s;cour&s;e in general concerning the City of <HI>Tun|quin,</HI> and of the Manner how the Author came to have knowledge thereof.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> has been long unknown to the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> nei|ther have they, who have given us Rela|tions thereof, well under&s;tood the Coun|try, as having tru&s;ted too much to defective and fabulous De&s;criptions and Ob&s;ervations. Not that I am willing to be over &s;evere in cen&s;uring; but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively I am bold to af|firm, That this which I here make Public was extracted out of my Brother's Writings, of which I had the overlooking in
<PB N="2" REF="423">
my &s;econd Voyage that I made to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and of which I was the more confident, for that the Author had been one who had made Eleven or Twelve Voyages from <HI>Batavia, Bantam,</HI> and <HI>Achem,</HI> to <HI>Tunquin.</HI> Other Ob&s;erva|tions I collected from the <HI>Tunquine&s;i</HI> them&s;elves, with whom I have had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es, during the time that I was at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> where they principally trade. And that which gave me the more light was this, That tho&s;e Merchants &s;everal times bring along with them &s;ome of their <HI>Bonze's</HI> or Prie&s;ts, as al&s;o &s;ome of their Learned Men to teach their Children to Write and Read. For the&s;e Mer|chants when they make a Voyage by Sea, carry all their Families along with them. And from the&s;e <HI>Bonze's</HI> and other Learned Men I had &s;everal Ob&s;ervations and Memoirs in Writing, as being de&s;irous to be inform'd by me of the Government and Situation of our <HI>France.</HI> And as I was never without an <HI>Atlas</HI> and &s;ome other particular Maps, they were ravi&s;h'd with admiration, when I &s;hew'd them the Structure and Compo&s;ure of the whole World, and the Situation of its &s;everal Kingdoms and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Therefore may the Reader with the more plea&s;ure and delight peru&s;e the&s;e Relations, when he has &s;o much rea&s;on to be per&s;uaded that they are cordially done, and that they are made public by a per&s;on who&s;e &s;incerity has no de&s;ign to abu&s;e him. My Brother, who was a per&s;on both cun|ning and couragious, and one that lov'd to Travel as well as my &s;elf, having heard much talk in the <HI>Indies</HI> of the Grandeur of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> re&s;olv'd to go thither, and as he had a particular gift to learn a Language in a little time, he &s;oon grew familiar with the <HI>Malaye,</HI> which is the Language of the Learned in tho&s;e quarters of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as <HI>Latin</HI> is among Us in <HI>Europe.</HI> He under&s;tood that Silk, Musk, and other Commodities of the like nature, were much cheaper there then in other places adjoyning, and that the People dealt with more fairne&s;s and hone&s;ty. Upon the encourage|ment of which Information he prepar'd a Ship, and made his Voyages with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He always carri'd with him a good Sum of Money; and more then that, he &s;tor'd him&s;elf with a con&s;iderable number of &s;mall Curio&s;ities, to pre&s;ent the King and his Nobility, according to the general Cu&s;tom of all the Ea&s;tern Countries:
<PB N="3" REF="423">
Thus he came to be well receiv'd the fir&s;t time that he &s;et foot in the Country; &s;o that the Cu&s;tomer being by him oblig'd with a &s;mall Clock, a pair of &s;mall Pi&s;tols, and two Pictures, which were the Pictures of two <HI>Curte&s;ans,</HI> imme|diately gave notice to the King of his arrival. Thereupon having order to attend the Court, and coming to ki&s;s the King's hands, the whole A&s;&s;embly was &s;urpris'd to hear a Stranger, born in a Country &s;o far di&s;tant, &s;peak the <HI>Malaye</HI> Language &s;o fluently. The King gave him a favourable reception, and kindly receiv'd the Pre&s;ent which he brought along with him. It was a very noble Sword, of which the Handle and Hilt were all over enchac'd with Rubies and Emraulds, with a Back&s;word Blade. To this he added a pair of Pi&s;tols, adorn'd and inlaid with Silver, a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Saddle and Bridle, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, a Bow and Quiver full of Arrows, and &s;ix Pictures, like tho&s;e which he had given the Cu&s;tomer. The&s;e things highly pleas'd the King, who pre&s;ently drew forth the Sword out of the Scabbard, the better to look upon and con&s;ider it. At length one of his Sons took it up, to try whether it would fit his hand as well as tho&s;e of his own Country, and offer'd to make a blow. My Brother, &s;eeing the young Prince handle the Weapon gracefully enough, after the manner of the Country, told the King, that if he pleas'd, he would &s;how the King how they handled that Weapon in <HI>France,</HI> of which the King readily con&s;ented to be a Spectatour.</P>
<P>This was my Brother's fir&s;t Reception at Court; for he made &s;everal Voyages to <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and every time that he return'd, they &s;till the more and more obligingly entertain'd him. But that which fix'd him more in the good opinion and favour of the King and Lords of the Court, was his frolic and gentile behaviour in playing with them for &s;everal large Sums, in&s;omuch that being one that ventur'd deep, he lo&s;t above 20000 Crowns in one Voyage. However the King, who was a generous Prince, would not &s;uffer him to be a lo&s;er, but gave him tho&s;e con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents that &s;uppli'd his lo&s;&s;es. By means of my Brother's thus long &s;o journing in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and the familiar acquaintance which he had at Court, together with the Trade which he drove in the Kingdom, as he was diligent to inform him&s;elf of all the Curio&s;ities of the Country, it was ea&s;ie for me upon
<PB N="4" REF="424">
the &s;ame foundation to lay the Structure of the&s;e Memoirs. Though I may &s;afely &s;ay, I was no le&s;s laborious in my own particular, and by the frequent Di&s;cour&s;es which I had with a great number of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> with whom I met both at <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> that came thither to Trade, and whom I often treated at my own Expences, to inform my &s;elf of the particular Ceremonies and Cu&s;toms of their Country.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the Grounds and Foundations of this Rela|tion, which is both faithful and exact, and by which that noble Country, of which the De&s;criptions hitherto have been &s;o ob&s;cure and uncertain, &s;hall be truly di&s;cover'd and &s;et forth, &s;uch as it is; declaring withal, that no other Con|&s;ideration or Intere&s;t, then that of &s;peaking truth, has incited me to undertake this De&s;cription.</P>
<P>For the better ob&s;ervation of a right Method in pur&s;uance of this Relation, and to conduct the Reader <HI>gradatim</HI> to the more perfect knowledge of this Kingdom, I will &s;peak fir&s;t of its Situation, its Extent, and its Climate. Next I &s;hall come to di&s;cour&s;e of its Qualities, its Riches, and its Trade, which are the three Springs and Sources of the Strength and Force of a Nation. Next I &s;hall give an Ac|count of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the People as well in their particular OEconomy and Civil Society, as in relation to their Marriages, their Vi&s;its and Fe&s;tivals. Next to this we &s;hall give a brief Account of the Learning, and learned Men, and among them of their Phy&s;icians, and the Subject of their Art, that is to &s;ay, of the Di&s;ea&s;es particular to the Country. We &s;hall al&s;o give a Relation of the Original of the Government and Policy of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> of the Condition of the Court, of the Inauguration and Fune|rals of their Kings, and in the la&s;t place of the Original of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And I dare ingage, that the Map of the Country, and the Cuts which were drawn upon the place, will no le&s;s contri|bute to the Diverti&s;ement of the Reader, then to the Expla|nation of the Matter which they contain.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Situation and Extent of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall have the le&s;s rea&s;on to admire where|fore our Predece&s;&s;ors had &s;o little knowledge of this Kingdom, when we con&s;ider that having formerly been a con&s;iderable part of <HI>China,</HI> the In|habitants in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> did, kept them|&s;elves clo&s;e within their own bounds, never minding to have any Commerce with other People, whom they con|temn'd and lookt upon as <HI>Barbarians</HI> come from the other part of the World. But now that they find that Strangers come to find them out in their own Territories, they begin to &s;ee that other People have as good Government as them|&s;elves; which has bred in them a de&s;ire to Conver&s;e and Trade with Foreigners; &s;o that now they a&s;&s;ociate them|&s;elves in friendly manner with all other People, as I have ob&s;erv'd them to do both at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam.</HI> Mo&s;t people believe this Country to lye in a very hot Climate; neverthele&s;s it is now known to be very temperate, by rea&s;on of the great number of Rivers that water it; which, together with the Rains that fall in their Sea&s;ons, cau&s;e a brisk fre&s;hne&s;s of the Air; which indeed happ'ns mo&s;t u&s;ually over all the <HI>Torrid-zone,</HI> as I have ob&s;erv'd in my <HI>Indian Travels.</HI> From whence we may al&s;o have rea&s;on to believe the Country to be very fruitful and thick inha|bited.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t this Kingdom lies upon the Province of <HI>Cau|ton,</HI> one of the be&s;t of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>To the We&s;t it is bounded by the Kingdom of <HI>Brama.</HI></P>
<P>To the North it borders upon two other Provinces of <HI>China, Junnan</HI> and <HI>Quan&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>To the South it lies upon <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and the great Gulph of the &s;ame name.</P>

be&s;ides, the Pe&s;tilence, the Gout, the Stone, and other Di&s;ea&s;es &s;o frequent in <HI>Europe,</HI> there are never known. There are but two Winds, which divide the whole Year between them; the one blowing from the North, the other from the South, and both continuing the &s;ame for &s;ix months together. The fir&s;t refre&s;hes the Earth in that manner, that there is nothing &s;o delightful as the Country of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> The other begins to blow from the end of <HI>January</HI> to the end of <HI>July;</HI> and the two la&s;t months are their months of rain. The greate&s;t inconvenience is, that there ari&s;e once in &s;eaven years, as well in this Country as in other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> tho&s;e hideous and terrible Tempe&s;ts, that blow down Hou&s;es, tear up Trees by the roots, and make &s;trange De&s;olations. They &s;eldom la&s;t above four and twenty hours, nor are their &s;ad Effects to be felt but only upon the Seas of <HI>China, Japon, Cochin|china, Tunquin,</HI> and the <HI>Manilles,</HI> being rarely known in any other Seas.</P>
<P>The A&s;trologers of tho&s;e parts believe that the&s;e terrible Tempe&s;ts proceed from the Exhalations that ri&s;e out of the Mines of <HI>Japon.</HI> It comes with that &s;uddain force that when it &s;urprizes a Ve&s;&s;el out at Sea, the Pilots have no other remedy then to cut down all the Ma&s;ts, that the &s;torm may have the le&s;s force upon the Ship.</P>
<P>In this fair extent of Land, almo&s;t equal to that of <HI>France,</HI> are &s;everal Provinces, who&s;e limmits are not well known; the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> being no great Geographers, nor having bin over curious to write the Annals of the Nation. But the mo&s;t under&s;tanding and knowing among them a&s;&s;ur'd me at <HI>Batavia,</HI> that the whole Kingdom contain'd above twenty thou&s;and Cities and Towns.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Quality of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Country for the mo&s;t part is a level Extent, which ri&s;es up and down into plea&s;ant Hillocks; the greate&s;t Hills which it has lying to the North. It is water'd by &s;everal Rivers which inter-cut and glide through the Country: &s;ome of which carry Galleys of good burthen, and large Shallops, very commodious for trade. Yet in all the Country there grows neither Corn nor Wine, by rea&s;on of the want of rain, which never falls but in the Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> But it bears an infinite quantity of Rice, which is the chief &s;u&s;tenance of the People. Of this Rice al&s;o they make their Drink, be&s;ides which they have good <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> or Strong-water. Their Fruits are excellent, but much different from ours, as are al&s;o the Trees that bear them. The chiefe&s;t of the&s;e Trees are the Palm-tree, which bears a Fruit bigger then in any part of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The Nut is about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Head, in &s;hape like a <HI>Coco</HI>-nut; the Shell is very hard, and being open'd, the Pulp within is as white as Snow, having a ta&s;t like our Almonds, and every one of the Fruits contains about two gla&s;sfuls of Liquor, very refre&s;hing and plea&s;ing to the Palate. The <HI>Gogavier,</HI> very much re&s;embles our Lawrel, of which there are two &s;orts; the one bears a Plum, green without and red within: but the Fruit of the other Tree, which is in much more e&s;teem, is yellowi&s;h without and white within, the top of the Fruit being like a &s;mall No&s;egay: the Pulp is full of &s;mall Kernels, le&s;s then tho&s;e of a Pomegranate; and if they be eaten before they are ripe they bind the belly, whereas being eaten when they are come to full maturity they work a contrary effect. Formerly this Fruit was not known in the Kingdom of <HI>Tun|quin,</HI> but after the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;eated them&s;elves at <HI>Macao,</HI> they carri'd &s;everal Plants thither, &s;o that now the Fruit is grown very common. The <HI>Papager</HI> bears a Fruit which very much re&s;embles a &s;mall Melon, the ta&s;t whereof is very delicious. The <HI>Arager</HI> grows upright and &s;treight, like the Ma&s;t of a
<PB N="8" REF="426">
Ship&punc; bearing no Branches but at the top, which makes it appear like a Crown. The Fruit which it produces is like a Nutmeg, but a little more round. The People break this Nut, and brui&s;ing it together with <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> leaves, mix both with a little Chalk, and make u&s;e of the Powder to keep their Teeth clean, to dye their Lips of a Vermilion colour, and to keep their Breath &s;weet.</P>
<P>They have but two &s;orts of Figs, the one like ours, and the other like tho&s;e which are call'd <HI>Adam</HI>'s Figs, as long as a Man's finger.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Tree, very like our <HI>Willow,</HI> which they call the <HI>Powder Tree,</HI> becau&s;e that of the Wood they make Charcoal, and of the Coal a Powder which they make u&s;e of in their Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jambager</HI> is another Tree, that grows very high, which bears a Fruit about the bigne&s;s of a Citrul-Cucum|ber, the Pulp whereof is full of Kernels like a Granate, very cooling and plea&s;ant, and very frequently eaten in the Sea&s;on of heat.</P>
<P>The High-ways are al&s;o planted with Trees on both &s;ides for the convenience of Travellers: And there are &s;ome of the&s;e Trees &s;o big that two or three thou&s;and men may &s;tand under them, like that at <HI>Ormus,</HI> or <HI>Bandar Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> by me de&s;crib'd in my Relations of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and of which many other Travellers have made mention. When the Branches of the&s;e Trees are about ten or twelve foot long, there i&s;&s;ue forth other little Branches which turn downward, and by little and little de&s;cending to the ground, take root and afterwards become as it were &s;o many Pillars to &s;upport the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>-Branches. There are &s;ome of the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>-Branches three hundred Paces long, which are &s;upported by the&s;e out|growing Branches at the di&s;tance of every ten or twelve foot. The Fruit is of the bigne&s;s of one of our great Nuts, the Shell whereof is red, containing within nothing but a Kernel like a grain of Millet. The Rere Mice feed upon 'em, and al&s;o make their Ne&s;ts in the trees. The&s;e Rere-mice are as big as a good Pullet, in&s;omuch that their Wings are above a foot and a half long. They never light upon the tree like other Birds, but you &s;hall &s;ee them all the day long hanging at the branches of the trees, fa&s;ten'd by their Claws to the tree with their heads downward. Upon every Wing
<PB N="9" REF="426">
they have &s;even as it were little Hooks or Claws, &s;o that being &s;hot, they never fall to the ground, but remain fixed to the branches, that at a di&s;tance you would take them to be &s;ome great Pears that hung upon the tree. They are ac|counted a great dainty among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who leave their Pullets to eat them. 'Tis true that their Fle&s;h is very white, and when they are young they are a delicate &s;ort of Diet. I happen'd to eat of them two or three times with the <HI>Por|tugals,</HI> who thought they had oblig'd me with a great dainty; and had I not known what they were, I &s;hould have taken them for Pullets. And now I am talking of the Delicacies of the Country, I will tell you of one &s;ort of Dyet which is very &s;ingular. This Food is the Ne&s;t of a certain Bird which is no where to be found, but in the four I&s;lands that lie upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and of which you have the Figures in the Table <HI>A, B, C, D.</HI> The&s;e Birds are about the bigne&s;s of a Swallow, and build their Ne&s;ts in &s;uch a manner, that they are neither too clo&s;e compacted, nor alto|gether tran&s;parent; they are like an Onion compos'd of &s;everal rings and envelopings; that compo&s;e a Ne&s;t of a cer|tain &s;ort of <HI>Gunim,</HI> which is &s;teep'd in warm water, and mix'd with all the Sawces which are made both for Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h. It is tran&s;ported all over <HI>India</HI> and into <HI>Holland</HI> for Curio&s;itie's &s;ake. You would believe in eating tho&s;e Meats which are &s;ea&s;on'd therewith, that tho&s;e Ne&s;ts were compos'd of all the Spices in the Orient. I have not only brought this Diet into <HI>France,</HI> and pre&s;ented of it to &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, but I have al&s;o my Vouchers for the truth of what I relate, &s;everal of my Friends who have brought it from <HI>Holland,</HI> among the re&s;t <HI>M. de Villermont,</HI> who&s;e Name is famous for his Travels into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> He and all tho&s;e that have eat thereof agree with me, that all the Spices of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> put together, do not give that effectual reli&s;h and &s;avour as the&s;e Ne&s;ts do, to the Meats and Di&s;hes wherein they are us'd.</P>
<P>Near to the&s;e four I&s;lands, where the&s;e Birds Ne&s;ts are found, are five others mark'd in the Map 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In the&s;e five I&s;lands are &s;uch infinite number of <HI>Tortoi&s;es,</HI> and &s;uch excellent Food, that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> do not believe they have entertain'd their Friends at a Banquet as they ought to do, till the <HI>Tortoi&s;es</HI> are brought in. Tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="427">
two Nations pickle up great quantities of them, and &s;end them abroad, which is a va&s;t trade among them; and indeed the chiefe&s;t occa&s;ion of the Wars between them is, becau&s;e the <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> do all they can to hinder the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> to fi&s;h for them, alledging that tho&s;e Seas and I&s;lands belong to them. Neither is the Meat but the Shell al&s;o of great e&s;teem, and one of the greate&s;t Commodities for Trade in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tunquin</HI> al&s;o affords great &s;tore of <HI>Anana's</HI> and Orange trees, of which there are of two &s;orts: the one that bears a Fruit no bigger then an <HI>Abricot;</HI> the other bigger then tho&s;e of <HI>Portugal:</HI> both alike in ta&s;t, and being to be gather'd from the tree for &s;ix months together. They have al&s;o two &s;orts of Citrons, the one yellow, the other green; but both the one and the other &s;o tart and &s;ow'r, that they cannot be eaten without offence to the Stomach. Neverthele&s;s, the Juyce is made u&s;e of as we do here of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> to clean&s;e Copper, Tin, and Iron, before we gild tho&s;e Metals, as al&s;o for Tinctures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Silk. They are al&s;o made u&s;e of for Lyes to whiten Linnen, and to take out Spots. Through all the Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> they make u&s;e of this Juyce of Citrons to whiten their Calicuts; whereby they make them &s;ometimes &s;o white that they dazle the &s;ight.</P>
<P>They make great quantities of Silk in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which both rich and poor make them&s;elves Garments. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who thru&s;t them&s;elves in every where, where there is any hope of gain, carry off &s;uch a quantity every year, that it is now become the chiefe&s;t part of that Commodity which they carry to <HI>Japon;</HI> whereas before they fetch'd their Commodities from <HI>Per&s;ia, Bengala,</HI> or <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for &s;weet &s;melling Flow'rs, the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have but one &s;ort, which they call the Flow'r of <HI>Bague.</HI> It grows like a large No&s;egay, and the Branches of the Shrub that bear it, &s;pread them&s;elves crawlingly upon the ground. As they have great &s;tore of Sugar, &s;o they eat very much, while it is yet in the Cane, not having the true Art to refine it: and that which they do gro&s;ly refine, they make into little Loaves weighing about half a pound. They eat very much, making u&s;e of it always after Meals to help dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="427">
Through the whole Kingdom are neither Lions, A&s;&s;es, nor Sheep; but the Fore&s;ts are full of Tigers, Harts, and Apes, and the Fields are full of Beeves, Cows, and Hogs. As for Hens, Ducks, and Turtles, they are not to be num|ber'd, which is the general Provi&s;ion for their Fe&s;tivals. Their Hor&s;es are very well &s;hap'd; of which there are always five or &s;ix hunder d in the King's Stables; He al&s;o keeps the &s;ame number of Elephants, of which &s;ome are for the Service of his Hou&s;e, the re&s;t bred for the Wars. The&s;e Elephants are of a prodigious bigne&s;s, neither are there any &s;o tall nor &s;o nimble in any part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> for they will bow them&s;elves, and &s;toop &s;o low, that you may get upon their backs without help. They have no Cats, but they have Dogs that &s;erve for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and will watch all night to kill the Rats and Mice, which are very large and very trouble&s;om. Very few Birds are to be &s;een in the Air; which toward the evening grows duski&s;h, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e va&s;t number of Gnats that get into the Hou&s;es in the night time and hinder people from &s;leeping, not only by the noi&s;e which they make, but with their con|tinual &s;tinging; which is one of the greate&s;t inconveniencies of the Country. For remedy whereof in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an hour before they go to &s;leep they take the Husk or Chaff of the Rice, which flies from the Rice when it is beaten, and &s;trew it upon a &s;mall Fire in a Fire-&s;hovel, and &s;o let it &s;moak, and by that means they kill or drive tho&s;e Flies away. Be|&s;ides this, they cover the Bed with a Pavilion or Tent that trails upon the ground, made like a Net with very &s;mall holes to let in the Air. But notwith&s;tanding all the pre|vention can be us'd, they will be about a man when he ri&s;es i' the morning. But there is yet a far greater inconvenience in this Country, which proceeds from the infinite numbers of white Emmets, which though they are but little, have teeth &s;o &s;harp, that they will eat down a wooden Po&s;t in a &s;hort time. And if great care be not taken in the places where you lock up your Bales of Silk, in four and twenty hours they will eat through a Bale, as if it had been &s;aw'd in two in the middle. Several of them have fallen from the Ciel|ing into my Neck, where they rais'd Bli&s;ters upon the Skin, which pre&s;ently fall again being wa&s;h'd with cold Water.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="428">
I have told you that Hens and Ducks are infinitely nume|rous in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> I will now tell you how they pre&s;erve the Eggs of the&s;e Creatures, which they will keep for two or three years together without being &s;poil'd. They &s;alt them, and to make them take &s;alt, they fill a Ve&s;&s;el full of Water, and throw a good quantity of Salt into it. If the Egg &s;ink to the bottom, the Pickle is not good; then they throw in more Salt, till they find that the Eggs &s;wim. The Pickle being thus made, they take A&s;hes, and make them up into a Pa&s;t with this Pickle: and in this Pa&s;t they enclo&s;e every Egg by it &s;elf, and then wrap it up in a leaf of an Herb, not unlike one of our Pear-tree leaves, but much larger, and then put the Eggs into Earthen Pots clo&s;e cover'd: after which manner they keep their Eggs for two or three years together.</P>
<P>In other parts of the <HI>Indies</HI> where there is great &s;tore of Oyl, as in the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and <HI>Arochan,</HI> they put their Eggs into great Earthen Pots well varni&s;h'd, and then fill the Ve&s;&s;el with an Oyl which is made of a &s;mall Seed like Rape-&s;eed. For as for Sallad Oyl, after you are once pa&s;s'd <HI>Aleppo,</HI> you &s;ee no more Olive-trees over all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> but only in one place of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> near <HI>Casbin,</HI> where between the Mountains lies a little Valley, about a League long and half a League broad, full of Olive-trees, but they make but very little Oyl, pre&s;erving the Olives only to eat. But to return to the Eggs; they are the chief Provi&s;ion which they eat a Ship-board. But the Eggs which are pre&s;erv'd in Salt are preferr'd much before tho&s;e that are kept in Oyl; becau&s;e that in u&s;ing the fir&s;t, there is no need of carrying Salt to Sea, or of boiling Salt with their Rice. When they eat them, they boil them till they are hard, and with every mouthful of Rice they eat a Pea's bigne&s;s of Egg, which is as good and better then Salt with their Rice. As to what remains, there are neither Mines of Gold nor Silver in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they Coin any Money.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Riches, Trade, and Money of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE chief Riches of the Country of <HI>Tunquin</HI> con&s;i&s;t in the great quantity of Silks which they &s;ell to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and other Foreigners, and in their <HI>Lig|num Aloes.</HI> Of which there is &s;ome worth a thou&s;and Crowns the Pound, according to its goodne&s;s and oyline&s;s. There is &s;ome that is not worth above three Crowns, but it is dry and good for nothing but to make Cabinets, or Beads to hang about Womens Necks. All the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as let their Beards grow, make great account of this Wood; and when they give a Vi&s;it, they pre&s;ently bring a little Cha&s;ing-di&s;h, and ca&s;t a &s;mall piece of this Wood upon the Coals, which yields a &s;moak and plea&s;ing mi&s;t; with which they perfume their Beards, at the &s;ame time lifting up their hands to Heaven, and crying, <HI>Elhemed Illah,</HI> or <HI>God be thanked.</HI> If the Wood be oily, the bigne&s;s of a Pea will &s;erve to throw upon the fire, which being a little moi&s;ten'd in Water, will yield as much &s;moak as a dry piece as big as a Man's fi&s;t. Which is the rea&s;on, that if it be oily and good it wants no price. One of the chief Pre&s;ents, as I have ob&s;erv'd in another part of this Book, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> &s;ent to the Emperor of <HI>Japon,</HI> was a piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> &s;ix foot long, and two round. It co&s;t 40000 <HI>Pardo's</HI> or 54000 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;o much the more plea&s;ure and profit to trade with the People of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> by how much the more faithful and frank they are in their dealing then the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who will deceive you if they can; &s;o that it is a hard thing to be too cunning for them, as I have often found by experience. When you have fold them any Commodity, and they find that their Bargain is not very advantageous, their general way of getting off is this: As they have generally three forts of Reals, one &s;ort that is full weight, others which are light, four, others eight <HI>per Cent.</HI> if they have no mind to &s;tand to their bargain, they offer to pay you for your Goods
<PB N="14" REF="429">
in light Reals, which they have clipt them&s;elves, and &s;o you are deceiv'd. There are no &s;uch People for Trade in the World: they refu&s;e to deal in nothing, even in old Shoes, and if you will &s;ell them but one of them too, they'l buy it, without ever enquiring why you will not &s;ell the other. But for tho&s;e of <HI>Tunquin</HI> they are more blunt and plain in their dealing, &s;o that it is a plea&s;ure to have to deal with them. I have told you, there are neither Mines of Gold or Silver in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they Coin Money there. So that in Trade they make u&s;e of certain Lingots of Gold, as they are brought out of <HI>China,</HI> &s;ome of which amount to 300 Livres of our Money, other to &s;ix hun|der'd. They al&s;o make u&s;e of Bars of Silver as they are brought from <HI>Japon.</HI> As for &s;mall Payments they either cut the large Bars into &s;mall pieces, to which purpo&s;e they have their Scales, like our <HI>Stelleers;</HI> or el&s;e they pay in Foreign-Coin, which are the Reals of <HI>Spain</HI> generally. This Gold and Silver is brought from <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> in lieu of tho&s;e va&s;t quantities of Silk which are exported out of the Country, which with Musk and <HI>Lignum Aloes</HI> are the chief Riches of the Kingdom.</P>

&s;aw in the year 1649, when the King was preparing to make War again&s;t the King of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> for certain Ships which the <HI>Cochinchine&s;es</HI> had taken from the <HI>Tunquine&s;es:</HI> though the Quarrel was taken up by certain Emba&s;&s;adors which the King of <HI>Cochinchina</HI> &s;ent to the King of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> to whom the former made &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Army that was then prepar'd to march upon this Expedition was compos'd of 8000 Hor&s;e, 94 thou&s;and Foot, and 722 Elephants; 130 for the War, and the re&s;t to carry the Tents and Baggage of the King and the Nobility; and 318 Galleys and Barks, very long and narrow, with Oars and Sails; and this was that which my Brother &s;aw. The Con|dition of the Souldiery is very toil&s;om and laborious, and of little advantage in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> For they are all their life time &s;o ti'd and engag'd to the Service of the Wars, that though they are capable of other Labours for the &s;upport of their Families, they are not permitted to undertake it. Tho&s;e days that they are not upon the Guard, they are oblig'd to attend their Captains where-ever they go, and two days in a week they are compell'd to Exerci&s;e with their Bows and Arrows in their pre&s;ence. Their Com|panies con&s;i&s;t of a hundred or a hundred and thirty Men; and they of each Company that have made the be&s;t &s;hot, have one of them two Months Wages, the other one, which is paid them in Rice. He that makes the wor&s;t &s;hot, next time he mounts the Guard, is oblig'd to &s;tand Centinel double his time. All the Captains look upon it as a great piece of glory to have their Souldiers Arms and Weapons neat and bright. If they find any ru&s;t upon them, they &s;conce them eight days Wages for the fir&s;t fault, and for the &s;econd they are very &s;everely cha&s;tis'd. As for tho&s;e that &s;erve in the Galleys, they are entertain'd and li&s;ted propor|tionably. And &s;ometimes the Captains &s;end their Souldiers aboard for &s;ome days, that they may learn to row. For it is one of the chiefe&s;t Pa&s;times of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin</HI> to &s;ee the Mock-fights of the Galleys. When he has a mind to delight him&s;elf with this Diverti&s;ment, the King, with &s;ome part of his Court, removes to one of his fair Palaces, that &s;tands upon one of the large&s;t Rivers in his Country; and it is a great Honour for any of the Captains who&s;e Souldiers carry the Victory. Now as the Victory is only got by the
<PB N="16" REF="433">
force of the Oars, it happens &s;ometimes that there are &s;ome Souldiers who &s;train them&s;elves &s;o hard, that they fall down dead with the Oar in their hands: for the King is the only Judge of the Combat. Wherein the plea&s;ure that he takes is &s;uch, that he &s;ends an Elephant to the Captain that obtains the Victory, and gives him three Months Wages be&s;ides. If any Souldier chance to die in this Exerci&s;e, his Widow or his Heirs have two years Pay. But notwith&s;tanding all their pain and labour, their Wages are &s;o &s;mall, that they are not able to maintain their Wives and Children. But in regard they Marry very young in this Country, the Wives as well of the Souldiers as of all the meaner &s;ort of people, take care to learn &s;ome Trade be&s;ides, that they may be able to maintain their Families. The Captains al&s;o have their work prepar'd for them. For they are oblig'd to look after the King's Elephants, and to manage them for the Wars, and &s;o to breed them, that they may not be afraid of Wild-fire, or any other Artificial Fires: as al&s;o to build places all along the Rivers, for the Galleys to ride &s;helter'd in, when they can no longer live out at Sea. All the&s;e Offi|cers and Captains, and Lords of the Court, which are gene|rally call'd <HI>Mandarins,</HI> have but four days in a Month to divert them&s;elves, two at the fir&s;t change of the Moon, and two at the full.</P>

&s;oft and plea&s;ing; happy memories, and in their Lan|guage, which is very florid, they u&s;e &s;everal appo&s;ite Com|pari&s;ons. They have good Poets among them, and People that love Learning; in which re&s;pect they are no way infe|riour to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> as well Men as Women, are for the mo&s;t part well proportion'd, of an Olive Complexion, very much admiring the whitene&s;s of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Their No&s;es and Faces are not &s;o flat as tho&s;e of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> as being generally better made. Their Hair is very black, which they u&s;ually wear as long as it will grow, being very care|ful in combing it. The Common People plait it in tre&s;&s;es, and tie it like a great Roll upon the top of their Heads. But the Nobility, Men of Law, and Souldiers, tie their Locks about their Necks, that they may not flutter in their Faces. They do not believe their Teeth to be hand&s;om, till they have made them as black as jet; and they &s;uffer their Nails to grow; the longe&s;t being accounted the faire&s;t.</P>
<P>Their Habit is grave and mode&s;t, being a long Robe that reaches down to their heels, much like that of the <HI>Japonne&s;es,</HI> without any di&s;tinction of Sex. This Habit is bound about at the wa&s;t with a Girdle of Silk, interwoven with Gold and Silver, the Workman&s;hip whereof is alike on both &s;ides. As for the Souldiers, their upper Garments reach no farther then their Knees; only their Breeches reach down to the mid Leg, without either Ho&s;e or Shoes.</P>
<P>The vulger &s;ort of People are altogether &s;laves for one part of the year. For unle&s;s they be the Citizens of the Capital City, where the King keeps his Court, all the other Handicrafts of what Trade &s;oever, as Joyners, Carpenters, Lock&s;miths, Ma&s;ons, and the like, are oblig'd every year to work three Months at the King's Palace; and two Months&punc; or Moons more (For the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> reckon their Months by the Moon) for the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or great Lords. The re&s;t of the year is for them&s;elves, all which time they have liberty to work for the &s;upport of their own Family. This Service in their Language is call d <HI>Viecquan,</HI> or the <HI>Condition of a Slave.</HI> But they are liable to other drudgeries wor&s;e then tho&s;e before mention'd; as to lop Trees, with which they chiefly feed their Elephants. This is a &s;evere days work, to which they were condemn'd by the great Grandfather of

the King that now reigns, after he had put an end to the Civil Wars that turmoil'd his Kingdom, and that he had brought his rebellious Subjects to &s;ubmit them&s;elves.

<P>I have told you el&s;ewhere that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> take great delight to live upon the Rivers, which are there free from Crocodiles and all other dangerous Animals, which haunt the Waters of <HI>Nile</HI> and <HI>Ganges.</HI> Where we are to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e Rivers overflow their Banks every year, after the Rains are fall'n, with that terrible violence, that many times they carry away whole Towns and Villages, at what time a good part of the Kingdom looks like a Sea, re&s;embling the lower <HI>Egypt</HI> under Water upon the Inundation of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Marriages of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> and their &s;everity toward Adultere&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> cannot Marry without the con&s;ent of the Father and Mother, or if they be dead, with|out the allowance of their neare&s;t Kindred. They mu&s;t al&s;o have the permi&s;&s;ion of the Judge or Governour of the place where the Marriage is to be made, for the obtain|ing of which they mu&s;t give him &s;ome Pre&s;ent. But in regard they were wont to exact upon the poor people more then they were able to give them, &s;o that many Marriages were di&s;appointed, to the great damage of the Public; the King, who reign'd in the year 1639, being inform'd of the&s;e Extor|tions, and their ill Con&s;equences, &s;et forth a Law to regu|late tho&s;e Abu&s;es, and to curb the Authority of the Gover|nours. He order'd that the young Man who was de&s;irous to Marry, &s;hould pay no more then &s;uch a Sum, according
<PB N="19" REF="435">
to the proportion of his E&s;tate, amounting to one or two fourths <HI>per Cent.</HI> and that they that were not worth above a hundred Crowns &s;hould pay nothing. Now in regard the Common People, both Men and Women, are naturally laborious, all that the Maids can get they pre&s;erve for their Portions, and to buy them two or three hand&s;om Garments, with a Neck-lace of Coral or yellow Amber, and a certain number of Beads, to garni&s;h their Locks; which they &s;uffer to hang down upon their Backs, accounting the beauty of their Hair to con&s;i&s;t in the length.</P>
<P>There is no Wedding kept without a great Fea&s;t; and they mu&s;t be very poor when the Fea&s;t la&s;ts not above three days; for &s;ometimes they junket for nine days together. The next day after the Wedding the Bridgroom calls the Bride his Si&s;ter, and &s;he calls the Bridegroom Brother. The Law of the Land permits the Man to divorce his wife when he plea&s;es, which they do many times for very &s;light cau&s;es. But the Woman has not the &s;ame Priviledge: or at lea&s;t, if &s;he de&s;ire a &s;eparation, it is much more difficult to obtain; and the occa&s;ion mu&s;t be very notorious. The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> &s;ay that this Law was made to keep the Women in &s;ub|jection, and to oblige them to be re&s;pectful to their Husbands. When the Husband de&s;ires this &s;eparation, the Ceremony is this. You mu&s;t know that many of the Ea&s;tern People never touch their Victuals with their hands, but make u&s;e of two little &s;ticks about &s;ix inches long, gilt and varni&s;h'd, which &s;erve them in&s;tead of Forks. The Husband then, when he goes about to repudiate his Wife, takes one of his own &s;ticks, and one of his Wife's, and having broken them, they take each one half, and &s;ow it up in a piece of Silk, in which they keep it. Then the Man is bound to re&s;tore the Woman what &s;he brought with her, and to keep the Chil|dren which they had between them. But the&s;e Divorces are not half &s;o frequent as formerly.</P>
<P>The Laws are al&s;o very rigorous again&s;t Adultere&s;&s;es. So that if a woman accus'd of this crime be convicted thereof, &s;he is ca&s;t to an Elephant bred up to this purpo&s;e, who pre|&s;ently throws her up into the Air with his Trunk, and when &s;he comes to the ground, tramples her under his feet, till he can perceive no life in her.</P>
<P>While my Brother was at the Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> he was a
<PB N="20" REF="436">
witne&s;s of the &s;evere Puni&s;hment, to which a Prince&s;s was condemn'd, for being taken in the Act with a certain Prince. It is the Cu&s;tom in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> when a Prince dies, to &s;hut up in the mo&s;t private and retir'd part of all his Palace all the women which he made u&s;e of in his life time. There they are allow'd two Maids to attend them, they eat alone, and &s;ee no per&s;on living any more to the very day of their deaths. I cannot tell by what means one of the Princes of the blood had got a view of one of the decea&s;ed King his Uncle's wives; but being de&s;irous to &s;ee her again, and to overcome all difficulties that oppos'd him, and to deceive the Guards that watch'd the Dores, he made u&s;e of a &s;light not ea&s;ily di&s;|cover'd. For you mu&s;t know, that in the Kingdom <HI>Tunquin,</HI> as in all the Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in the Hou&s;es of the Kings and other great Lords, the Kitchin is u&s;ually &s;eparated from the Hou&s;e, and that the Garden is between them; &s;o that for the better carrying the Meat from one place to another, the Servants make u&s;e of a kind of Flasket, or rather Iron Che&s;t. And to keep the Meat warm, the Di&s;hes are &s;up|ported by little &s;ticks laid athwart, about an inch di&s;tant one from another, under which is an Iron Plate with holes pierc'd quite through, about half a foot above another, which makes the bottom of the Che&s;t; between which Plates they put lighted Coals, to keep the Meat warm. The&s;e Che&s;ts being to be carri'd by two men, the <HI>Tunquine&s;e</HI> Prince plaid his game &s;o well, that he was put into one of the&s;e Che&s;ts wherein the Prince&s;&s;es Meat was wont to be carri'd up into her Apartment. But he was not there many days before the thing was di&s;cover'd. He was pre&s;ently brought before the King, who caus'd him to have &s;everal weighty Chains to be put about his Neck and Wa&s;t, and upon his Hands and Leggs; and thus chain'd and manacled, he order'd him to be led about for five Months together, to be &s;een by the People. After that he was &s;hut up in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on, where he remain'd &s;even years, till the death of the King, who&s;e Son coming to the Throne, &s;et him at liberty, upon condition he &s;hould &s;erve as a private Souldier upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom. As for the Prince&s;s &s;he was &s;hut up in a little Chamber upon the top of a Tow'r, where &s;he remain'd twelve days without having any thing given her to eat or drink; after that the Chamber
<PB N="21" REF="436">
was all uncover'd at the top, that the &s;un might come at her, and &s;corch her to death, and &s;o &s;he di'd in three days. The two Maids that &s;erv'd her had a little more favour, for they were thrown to the Elephants, who pre&s;ently trod them to death. The two Porters of the Che&s;t, or Flasket, were ti'd to four &s;mall Galleys, by the two Hands, and two Leggs, and as they Row'd &s;everal ways were pre|&s;ently di&s;membred.

<P>AMong all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are the mo&s;t &s;ociable, and mo&s;t frequently vi&s;it one ano|ther. Generally they make their Vi&s;its about Noon, in the hotte&s;t time of the day, and then every one walks with a Train &s;uitable to his Condition. The Princes and <HI>Mandarines</HI> ride upon their Elephants, or el&s;e they are carri'd in a kind of Litter, where they may either &s;it or lie. Six Men carry it, and behind them follow &s;ix more to ea&s;e them by times. Their Train con&s;i&s;ts generally of fifty or &s;ixty Per&s;ons; neither are they permitted to exceed that number. As for the ordinary Gentry, and Officers of the Court, they ride a Hor&s;e-back, not being allow'd above &s;even or eight Servants to attend them. They chew <HI>Betl&egrave;</HI> continually, as all the other <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> do in &s;uch places where it is to be had. And when any one comes to vi&s;it another, it would be taken for a great affront, if at his taking leave, he &s;hould not be pre&s;ented with a Box of <HI>Betl&egrave;,</HI> to take what he pleas'd.</P>

All the&s;e Plates are brought up, rang'd in order, in a large Voyder, lacker'd like the Plates. U&s;ually the Voyder holds ten or twelve Plates, and the Meat is cut in little pieces, about the bigne&s;s of a Hazle Nut. They make u&s;e neither of Spoons, nor Knives, nor Forks, but only of tho&s;e little Sticks&punc; of which I have made mention in the foregoing Chapter, never touching their Meat with their fingers.</P>
<P>When there are &s;everal &s;itting at the Table, either at their ordinary Meals, or upon &s;ome Fe&s;tival, they account it a great piece of Manners to be &s;ilent; or if they have a de&s;ire to Di&s;cour&s;e, they alway allow the Elde&s;t the honour of beginning, bearing a great re&s;pect to them that are aged. But the Younge&s;t, at the Table, is never permitted to begin the Di&s;cour&s;e. They wa&s;h their Hands, their Mouths, and Faces before they &s;it down, but never after Meals. And when they de&s;ire to know whether every one has had his fill, they ask him whether he have eaten his Rice, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Ancient Fathers in Scripture, who, by Bread, meant the whole Repa&s;t. Neither is it a Cu&s;tom among them to ask one another how they do? but how many Mea&s;ures of Rice he eat for his Dinner, and whether he eat with an Appetite. This is a general Cu&s;tom among all the Idolatrous <HI>Indians,</HI> unle&s;s in the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where they eat not Rice only, but Bread, and there they ask in civility how much Rice they boil'd, and how much Meal they bak'd for Bread; for the more he eats, the better in health they think a man is.</P>
<P>Among all the Pa&s;times of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> there are none wherein they take &s;o much delight as in Comedies, which are only Acted in the Night-time; but tho&s;e which are pre|&s;ented the day that they fir&s;t behold the new Moon are the be&s;t. They la&s;t from Sun-&s;etting to Sun-ri&s;ing, and they are &s;et out with beautiful Decorations and Machines, very plea&s;ing to behold. They are excellently well skill&punc;d in repre&s;enting the Sea and Rivers, and making a &s;hew of Sea|fights, and Combats between Galleys and Barks, though they have &s;eldom more then eight Actors, Men and Women. The places appointed for the&s;e &s;ights, are great Halls, the third part whereof the Theater takes up, the re&s;t being fill'd with Benches for the Spectators. Upon each &s;ide of the Theater is a Box very &s;umptuou&s;ly &s;et out, re&s;erv'd for the
<PB N="24" REF="438">
King when he plea&s;es to come. The Actors and Actre&s;&s;es are very magnificently clad. The dre&s;s for the Womens heads being a kind of Miter or Diadem, which exceedingly becomes them, from the hinder part whereof two Ribonds, three fingers broad, hand down below their wa&s;ts. Both the one and the other Act their parts very perfectly, and, according to their manner, ob&s;erve an exact time in their Dancing.</P>

But, as I &s;aid before, they follow the&s;e &s;ports only upon the days that are permit|ted them, as being better husbands of their time then we, not &s;paring any part of it from bu&s;ine&s;s. So that they who at the beginning of that little knowledge which we had of the&s;e People, wrote that their Manners and Cu&s;toms were wild and barbarous, were mi&s;inform'd. For as there is no rea&s;on to doubt of the truth of what I affirm, and what others have confirm'd by other Relations, we may well conculde from what I have &s;aid, That all the Duties of Civil Society and Politene&s;s are not confin'd within our <HI>Europe;</HI> but that the Kingdom of <HI>Tun|quin,</HI> anciently a part of <HI>China,</HI> &s;till retains the good Govern|ment and Civility of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> them&s;elves.</P>

I do not here, by Learning, mean the under&s;tanding of the Languages of our Learned
<PB N="25" REF="438">
Men of <HI>Europe,</HI> which are altogether unknown to the Ea&s;tern People, and much le&s;s the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> of which they never &s;o much as heard. But we mean the knowledge of the Laws of their Country, by means whereof they obtain the charges of Judicature; the <HI>Mathe|maticks,</HI> and particularly <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> to which all the Ori|entals have a great inclination, as being great ob&s;ervers of the Stars, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they flatter them&s;elves to be able to foretel things to come. The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are al&s;o pa&s;&s;io|nate lovers of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> as being great admirers of <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Tragedy,</HI> of which tho&s;e two Sciences are the main Compo&s;ition; &s;o that the Mu&s;icians and Actors of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are accounted the be&s;t in the whole Ea&s;tern part of the World.</P>
<P>That you may acquire Nobility by Learning, in your Youth, you mu&s;t pa&s;s through three degrees, of the <HI>Synde,</HI> the <HI>Doucan,</HI> and the <HI>Tan&s;i,</HI> from which degree you may a&s;cend to that of the Nobility.</P>
<P>To attain the fir&s;t degree, it behoves the Youth of <HI>Tunquin</HI> to apply them&s;elves for eight years together to their Studies, and that very clo&s;e, to enable them&s;elves for the Office of a Notary, Proctor, and Advocate, to which there is nothing more conducing then to &s;peak Eloquently in public. At the end of eight years, they are examin'd concerning the duty of tho&s;e Employments; and if any one&punc;fail to give an An&s;wer to the Que&s;tions propounded, he is &s;ent back again as incapable to obtain any Employment for the future, or to &s;tudy any longer. For tho&s;e that acquit them&s;elves well of their Examination, which is very rigorous, their Names are &s;et down in a Regi&s;ter, and pre&s;ented to the King, who fir&s;t grants them the liberty to take upon them the Title of <HI>Synde,</HI> and then if it be their aim to enjoy the Quality of <HI>Doucan,</HI> they are com|manded by the <HI>Tan&s;i</HI>'s to &s;tudy <HI>Mu&s;ic, A&s;trology,</HI> and <HI>Poe&s;ie,</HI> not only to be able to be judge of it, but al&s;o to perform them&s;elves upon occa&s;ion. For to be good judges of <HI>Co|medy,</HI> which is a great Honour among them, it behoves them to be both good Comedians and Mu&s;icians. Nor in|deed is there any Pa&s;time more frequent then that of the Theater in this Country; for there is never any &s;olemn Fe&s;tival among them, which is not accompany'd and &s;et
<PB N="26" REF="439">
forth with Artificial Fire-works, in making whereof the&s;e People are exqui&s;ite; after which they have their Come|dies, with Machines, and change of Scenes in every Act. Be&s;ides this, their Actors have a prodigious memory, &s;o that let the part be never &s;o long, they never make u&s;e of Prompters to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, as we do in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They that will learn the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> mu&s;t make their own In&s;truments them&s;elves, and &s;pend five years in this &s;tudy. They are examin'd every year, and if they fail to an&s;wer &s;uch Que&s;tions as are ask'd them, for the fir&s;t four they are pardon'd; but at the end of the five years, if upon the grand Examination, they fail to an&s;wer the Que&s;tions demanded them by the <HI>Tan&s;is,</HI> they are utterly degraded; whereas if they &s;atisfie their Examinors, they are permitted the Name and Dignity of <HI>Doucan.</HI> After thirteen years thus &s;pent, before they can arrive to the degree of a <HI>Tan&s;i,</HI> they mu&s;t &s;pend four years more in learning to write and read the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Character to &s;uch a certain number of Words. For the life of a Man would not &s;uffice to learn to write and read the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> quite through. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that as to this particu|lar, it is not in <HI>China</HI> as in other Nations, where one Word is compos'd of &s;everal Letters. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> for every Word have a different Figure, all which Figures are very numerous, as you may ea&s;ily conjecture. By the by let me tell you, that the&s;e Figures are made with &s;mall Pen|cils, and that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> make u&s;e of a certain Ink, which is made up into a Pa&s;te, and &s;o moi&s;ten'd in Water as you make u&s;e of it. They have al&s;o another &s;ort of Colour for certain Words. But they cannot make u&s;e of Pens, as our <HI>Euro|peans,</HI> which are made of Quils; nor of tho&s;e of other Ea&s;tern People, which are made of &s;mall redi&s;h brown Reeds, the be&s;t of which grow in certain Mer&s;hes in the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Arachan.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Students of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> they are al&s;o oblig'd to under&s;tand the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> as well as their own; and the la&s;t four years being at an end, the la&s;t and great Examination is made in the great place, within the Enclo&s;ure of the Palace of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> which is a &s;tately Marble &s;tructure. There the King is pre&s;ent, with the Princes and great Lords of the Court, the <HI>Mande|rins</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="439">
for Learning; and all the <HI>Tan&s;i's;</HI> and many al&s;o come on purpo&s;e from di&s;tant Provinces to the Solemnity. Some Relations of <HI>Tunquin</HI> have been a little too ridiculous in this particular, a&s;&s;erting extravagantly, that &s;ome|times there are above 30 or 40000 Students pre&s;ent at the&s;e Examinations, but by what I could learn from my Brother, or gather by that di&s;cour&s;e which I have had with the Natives, the number of Students never exceeds three thou&s;and. There are in the place nine Scaffolds &s;et up&punc; of which the one is for the King and Princes, the other for the Examiners, and tho&s;e that are to be Examin'd: And for the better hearing what is &s;aid, the Scaffolds are built like an Amphitheater. But whereas there are eight days &s;pent in this Examination, the King and the <HI>Mandarins</HI> are never there but only the two fir&s;t days. The la&s;t day all the Names of them who have been Examin'd, as well they who have an&s;wer'd well, as of them that have falter'd, are left in the Hands of the &s;ixteen chief <HI>Manderins,</HI> who are as it were &s;ixteen Coun&s;ellors of State, and then it is at the King's plea&s;ure to favour whom he thinks fit, of tho&s;e, who have not given full &s;atisfaction to the Que&s;tions propounded to them. As for tho&s;e who were found very ignorant, they are degraded with &s;hame, and there is no more &s;aid of them. All tho&s;e Names are u&s;ually written upon large Tables, &s;et up at the Gate of the King's Palace for eight days together, to the end, that all the People may know who are receiv'd into the Rank of <HI>Nobility,</HI> and who not.</P>
<P>The eight days being pa&s;s'd, they are all to appear again upon the &s;ame Scaffolds, where in the view of all the World, they who have had the misfortune to have falter'd in their Examinations, are di&s;mi&s;s'd as unworthy of any Employment: while they who have behav'd them&s;elves worthy of approbation, are honour'd with a Ve&s;t of Vio|let Satin, which they pre&s;ently put on, and then take upon them the Name of <HI>Tan&s;i's.</HI> Then they have given them a Li&s;t of the Towns and Villages, where they are to receive the Rents which the King allows them; wherein however they have not an equal &s;hare; &s;ome being allow'd more, &s;ome le&s;s, according to their merit, or the favour of the Prince. Pre&s;ently they &s;end notice to the places a&s;&s;ign'd them of the
<PB N="28" REF="440">
time, at which they intend to be there: and then all the Inhabitants come forth to meet them, in Honour of their Dignity, with all &s;orts of Mu&s;ic, and a Guilded <HI>Branquar,</HI> carried by eight Men. There they are permitted to &s;tay three Months to divertize them&s;elves, and for their own recreation. After that they return to Court, to in&s;truct them&s;elves in the affairs of the Kingdom, and the King's Hou&s;e, and to perfect them&s;elves in the knowledge of tho&s;e things, which is the way to obtain the Dignity of a <HI>Man|darin.</HI> All Emba&s;&s;adours who are &s;ent to the Princes ad|joyning, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> are cho&s;en out of the&s;e <HI>Tan&s;i's,</HI> among whom they always make choice of the able&s;t, and not of the riche&s;t, the King allowing them &s;ufficient to maintain their Port, and defray the expences of the Emba&s;&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Phy&s;icians, and the Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Phy&s;icians belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> do not make it their bu&s;ine&s;s much to &s;tudy Books; &s;pending their Youth in &s;earching after the nature and qualities of the Roots and Simples, and how to apply them according to the nature of the Di&s;temper. But more particularly they apply them&s;elves to the beating of the Pul&s;e, and its diver&s;ity of Mea&s;ure, by which they chiefly pretend to under&s;tand the cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and what Remedy to make u&s;e of for cure. And therefore when they go to feel a Pul&s;e, they feel it in &s;everal parts of the Body; and according to the diver&s;ity of the part, and the beating, they judge of the quality of the Di&s;temper. Therefore upon their fir&s;t coming, they feel the Patient in three places, fir&s;t upon their right &s;ides, and &s;econdly upon their left. By the Pul&s;e which they feel upon the wri&s;t of the right hand, they gue&s;s of the condition of the Lungs; by that which they feel upon the Vein of the Arms, where
<PB N="29" REF="440">
generally People are let Blood&punc; they gue&s;s at the Di&s;tem|pers of the Stomach; and the Region of the Kidneys. The Pul&s;e of the left Wri&s;t di&s;covers to them the condition of the Heart: By that in the Veins of the left Arm, where u&s;ually they let Blood, they are inform'd of the e&s;tate of the Liver. By the Pul&s;es of the Temples, both right and left, they give a more exqui&s;ite judgment of the Kid|neys. They are very careful to count how many times a Pul&s;e of a &s;ick Per&s;on beats in the time of one Re&s;piration; and according to the&s;e &s;everal Pul&s;es, they tell you which part of the Body is particularly di&s;temper'd, whether the Heart, the Liver, or the Lungs; or whether the Di&s;tem|per proceed from any outward cau&s;e, as from Cold, Sadne&s;s, or any other di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They never make u&s;e of any other Remedies but of Herbs and Roots, which they choo&s;e them&s;elves; there being no di&s;tinction among them of <HI>Apothecary</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ician.</HI> The&s;e Herbs they mingle &s;ometimes with a little Ginger, which they boyl in Water, and give the Decoction, being &s;train'd, to the Patient. They have very good Receipts for the Purples, Epilep&s;ie, and &s;everal other Di&s;ea&s;es which are accounted incurable in <HI>Europe.</HI> They make u&s;e of <HI>China</HI> Ink to &s;top a Dy&s;entery, and for the cure of Wounds. When the Sea Ebbs from the &s;hoar upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts, they find upon the Sand a little &s;mall kind of Crabs, which dye immediately, and by the heat of the Sun, which is there extraordinary, become as hard as a Stone in a &s;hort time; the&s;e the <HI>Tunquine&s;e</HI> Phy&s;icians beat to Powder, and give to their Patients in Dy&s;enteries, and Feavers, &s;ometimes in <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> &s;ometimes in plain Water. They mightily ad|mire the Herb <HI>Tea,</HI> which comes from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan;</HI> which latter Country produces the be&s;t. It is brought to them in Tin Pots clo&s;e &s;top'd, to keep out the Air. When they would u&s;e it, they boyl a quantity of Water, accor|ding to the proportion they intend to u&s;e, and when the Water &s;eeths, throw a &s;mall quantity into it, allowing as much as they can nip between their Thumb and fore-Finger to a Gla&s;s. This they pre&s;cribe to be drank as hot as they can endure it, as being an excellent Remedy again&s;t the Headach, for the Gravel, and for tho&s;e that are &s;ubject to the Griping of the Guts; but then they order a little Ginger
<PB N="30" REF="441">
to be put into the Water when it boyls. At <HI>Goa, Batavia,</HI> and in all the <HI>Indian</HI> Factories, there are none of the <HI>Euro|peans</HI> who do not &s;pend above four or five Leaves a day; and they are careful to pre&s;erve the boyl'd Leaf for an Evening Sallad, with Sugar, Vinegar, and Oyl. That is accounted the be&s;t <HI>Tea</HI> which colours the Water greene&s;t; but that which makes the Water look Red, is little accounted of. In <HI>Japan.</HI> The King and great Lords, who drink <HI>Tea,</HI> drink only the Flower, which is much more whol&s;om, and of a ta&s;t much more plea&s;ing. But the Price is much different, for one of our ordinary Beer Gla&s;&s;es is there worth a <HI>French</HI> Crown.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t dangeroug Di&s;tempers that befall the <HI>Tunqui|ne&s;es,</HI> mo&s;t u&s;ually happen when the bad Air &s;urprizes the People; for of a &s;udden it deprives them of their Speech, and then Death &s;uddenly follows without a &s;peedy Remedy. The be&s;t Remedy for this &s;udden Di&s;temper is to mix &s;ome Counterpoi&s;on with <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> in&s;tead of Wine, and to let the Patient drink it as hot as he can. The Patient al&s;o mu&s;t at the &s;ame time&punc; be rub'd with a Cloth dip'd in <HI>Aqua Vitae&punc;</HI> where Cinger has been boyl'd. This takes away the pains caus'd by cold Winds, and unwhol&s;om Airs. Though &s;ome for the more &s;peedy cure of the&s;e pains. lay the Patient upon a Bed made only of Girts, four Fingers di&s;tant one from the other; and then &s;etting a Chafing-di&s;h underneath, cau&s;e the &s;ick Per&s;on to &s;weat in a Cloud of Frankincen&s;e, till the pain is gone, repeating the &s;ame thing Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>As for Blood-letting, it is by no means us'd in that Coun|try. They make u&s;e of Fire, e&s;pecially for the Purple-Feaver, a Di&s;ea&s;e &s;o dangerous in <HI>France.</HI> For the cure of this, the Phy&s;itians of <HI>Tunquin</HI> take the Pith of a Reed, which they dry very well; dip it in Oyl, and &s;et it on Fire: and then apply to every Purple Spot one of the&s;e lighted Wicks. The Spot will give a whif like a &s;mall Squib, and that's an infallible&punc;&s;ign that the Venom&punc; is gone out of the body. This Remedy is &s;eldom apply'd but in the night time, becau&s;e the Spot does not appear &s;o well in the day time. And the Phy&s;ician mu&s;t be very careful, that when this Venom flies out of the Patient's Body, it does not find a way into his own; for then there is no Remedy&punc;
<PB N="31" REF="441">
but Death. There are &s;ome Phy&s;icians that will prick the Purple Spot with a Needle, and let out the Pe&s;tilential Blood; after which they burn the part &s;o prick'd, and then rub it with Ginger, not permitting their Patient to take the Air in 20 days after they are cur'd. While they are under cure, they drink nothing but Water, with Citron|peel boyl'd in it, and ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h and Butter. They give them to eat Rice boyl'd in Water, and &s;alt Fi&s;h; but the more they ab&s;tain from eating and drinking, the &s;ooner they are cur'd. And indeed it is a wonderful thing to &s;ee the excellent effects of their Remedies in &s;o &s;hort a time; for they have no lingring Di&s;tempers to hold them years together, as they do among us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Original, Government, and Policy, of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not above &s;ix hundred years &s;ince <HI>Tunquin</HI> was fir&s;t govern'd by particular Kings, in regard it was anciently a part of the Dominion of the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> What is re|ported of the fir&s;t <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> That they were without Governours, and without Kings, is altogether fabulous&punc; like to that which is related of a certain Infant of three years of Age, who appearing before a great A&s;&s;embly of the People, exhorted them to free them&s;elves from the power of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who were their Oppre&s;&s;ors. Upon which a lovely Hor&s;e miraculou&s;ly appearing to the &s;aid Infant, he mounted the Hor&s;e, and immediately &s;etting for|ward with tho&s;e that were gather'd after him, as al&s;o others that appear'd as wonderfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, he &s;et upon the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and defeated them in &s;uch manner, that they never dur&s;t venture after that to return any more to reconquer what they had lo&s;t. But the mo&s;t certain truth of <HI>Tun|quin</HI> Hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us, That for the&s;e &s;ix Centuries la&s;t pa&s;t&punc; it has been govern'd by &s;ix various Families. The fir&s;t that a&s;&s;um'd the Title of King was a famous Robber, who&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="442">
Name was <HI>Din,</HI> who having gather'd together a great Number of Malecontents, and Vagabonds, became &s;o powerful and formidable through his own Valour, that after &s;everal bloody Battels gain'd, it was no difficult thing for him to &s;eize upon the Throne. But he did not reign long in peace, for the mo&s;t part of the People rebell'd again&s;t him; and in the fir&s;t Battel that he fought, he lo&s;t his Life. However his own Party won the day; and having left two Sons, his elde&s;t reigned three years; after who&s;e death, the younger Brother rul'd in his &s;tead, but dy'd &s;oon after, neither of the Brothers leaving any i&s;&s;ue behind them. After that the Kingdom was mi&s;erably di&s;tracted by &s;everal Civil Wars, till the weaker Party calling in the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, became the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant. Then it was that a certain <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Lelequel,</HI> was advanc'd to the Throne, who being a valiant and prudent Prince, re&s;tor'd tranquillity to the whole Kingdom. Who, when he &s;aw him&s;elf E&s;tabli&s;h'd in peace, built that large Palace, which they, who have &s;een it, admire, as well for it's Circuit, as for its magnificent Structure, being all of Marble of divers Colours, both within and without. This King had but one Daughter, who &s;oon after her Father's death, the better to &s;ecure her &s;elf, marry'd one of the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Mandarins</HI> in the Country, of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Tran.</HI> But &s;oon after, one of her Subjects rebe&s;&s;ing again&s;t her, gave her battel, took her Pri&s;oner, and put her to death. Having thus got the Power into his hands, the Rebel u&s;urp'd the Throne; but nine years after, he was al&s;o &s;lain in Battel by his own Subjects, who had call'd the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. They being thus Ma&s;ters of the Kingdom, held it for twenty years, and &s;et Governours over every Province. But at length the <HI>Mandarins</HI> grew weary of their Oppre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e of the heavy Tributes which they laid upon the <HI>Tunquine&s;es;</HI> &s;o that a valiant Captain of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le,</HI> having a&s;&s;embled a numerous Power together, gave the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> three Battels, and in every one overcame them. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> thus expell'd out of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the Conquerour &s;eiz'd the Crown, and in his Family the Regal Government continu'd for above four|&s;core years. After which time, a great Lord, of the Family of <HI>Marr,</HI> which had formerly enjoy'd the Scepter,
<PB N="33" REF="442">
to Revenge him&s;elf of an affront which the King had put upon him at Court, found a way to e&s;cape his hands, and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a great Number of di&s;contented Per|&s;ons, of which the be&s;t regulated Kingdoms are always full, and the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who always &s;ought an opportunity to regain what they had lo&s;t, after a bloody Battel, he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the Kingdom, it being never known what became of his Predece&s;&s;or. But this new King en|joy'd the Fruits of his Victory but a &s;mall while. For two years afterwards; a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Trin,</HI> having e&s;pous'd the Daughter of another great Lord, openly declar'd War again&s;t his Soveraign, with a de&s;ign utterly to extirpate the Hou&s;e of <HI>Marr.</HI> Unhapplly for him, death put a &s;top to his de&s;igns, though he left two Sons behind him, able enough to have pur&s;u'd his undertakings. But the elde&s;t, naturally timorous, and fearing to engage him&s;elf in a dangerous War, voluntarily &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the King, who gave him the Government of a Province, and marry'd him to one of his Si&s;ter's Daughters. The younger Brother being a valiant Prince, and having his decea&s;ed Father's Army at his Devotion, though the King propos'd him great advantages, would give ear to nothing, but out of his ambition to Reign him&s;elf continu'd and &s;ucce&s;sfully ac|compli&s;h'd what his Father had begun: In the &s;econd Battle which he gave the King, who was there in per&s;on, he took him Pri&s;oner, together with his Brother, who had &s;ubmitted to him, and &s;ome few days after he put them both publicly to death at the head of his Army; the one as an unju&s;t u&s;urper of the Throne; the ether as a de&s;ertor, who had abandon'd his Father's Army, and &s;o ill follow'd his intentions.</P>
<P>Now though as Victor he might ea&s;ily have a&s;cended the Throne, and tak'n upon him the Name and Title of King&punc; yet he would not accept of any higher Title then that of General of the Army; and the better to E&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in his Authority, and to gain the affection of the People, he-caus'd Proclamation to be made through all the Provinces of the Kingdom, that if there were any Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le</HI> yet remaining alive, he &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf, with full a&s;&s;urance that upon his appearing, he &s;hould be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom. There was but one to be found,
<PB N="34" REF="443">
who had been &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Marr,</HI> while it rul'd, that to &s;ave his Life he was forc'd to ab&s;cond him&s;elf in the Frontiers of the Kingdom, under the Habit of a private Soldier. The General was overjoy'd to find that there was yet a lawful Heir of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le</HI> to be found, that he might place him upon the Throne. So that &s;o &s;oon as he was known to be of the Legitimate Race, all the Equipage and Attendance of a King was &s;ent to him, with Order to all the Provinces as he pa&s;s'd along, to receive him as if he were already crown'd. The whole Army march'd two days march to meet the King, and brought him to <HI>Checo,</HI> the capital City of the Kingdom, where he was plac'd in the Throne of his Father, and with great Pomp proclaim'd King of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> But General <HI>Trin,</HI> who car'd not &s;o much for the Royal Title, as the Royal Power, &s;o order'd his bu&s;ine&s;s, that leaving to <HI>Le</HI> all the outward &s;hew and Pomp of Royal Authority, he re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf the whole command of the Army, and the greate&s;t part of the Revenues of the Kingdom ab&s;olutely to di&s;po&s;e of at his own plea&s;ure. So that from that time to this hour, we may affirm that there has been, and &s;till are, two Kings of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which the fir&s;t has only the Name and Title of King, and is call'd <HI>Bo&uuml;a,</HI> and the &s;econd <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> who has all the Authority, di&s;po&s;ing of all things at his plea&s;ure, while the other remains &s;hut up in his Palace like a Slave, not permitted to &s;tir abroad but upon certain days: and then he is carry'd through the Streets of <HI>Checo,</HI> like an Image, though with a magnificent Train and Royal Equipage. He has generally 2000 Soldiers for his Guard; and &s;ometimes 20000 which are quarter'd upon the Frontiers, chiefly to|ward <HI>Cochinchina.</HI> He al&s;o has ready upon the Frontiers 50 Elephants for War. And upon the Rivers of the Kingdom where the Enemy can come to damage him, he u&s;ually keeps 100 great Galleys, with a va&s;t company of &s;mall Galliots, to which the Soldiers and Rowers that belong, have more pay then the others at Land. And the&s;e, that they may row with more &s;trength, row &s;tanding, with their Faces toward the Prow, quite contrary to our Row|ers, who turn their backs.</P>
<P>The King gives public Audience almo&s;t every day; but he makes no Edict, or public Decree, that is of any effect,
<PB N="35" REF="443">
if it be not al&s;o Sign'd by the <HI>Choua.</HI> At the&s;e Audiences he has with him thirty two Councellors of State, and be&s;ides the&s;e, a hundred others to judge of all Appeals of the Kingdom. The Eunuchs have a very great Power at Court, as in all other Courts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the King, as to his mo&s;t important affairs, confides more in them then in his own Children. The elde&s;t Children do not always &s;ucceed their Father; for the <HI>Choua,</HI> or General, with all the Coun|cellors, which are generally his Creatures, thought it con|venient, that when the King &s;hould have more Sons then one, he &s;hould make choice of whom he pleas'd to &s;ucceed him. So that &s;o &s;oon as he has nam'd him, the <HI>Cho&uuml;a&punc;</HI> attended by the principal Officers of the Army&punc; Councellors of State, and Eunuchs, come to congratulate him, and to give him their Oaths to &s;et him upon the Throne after the death of his Father; and for the other Brothers they are always &s;hut up in the Palace, as in a Pri&s;on, without medling with any affairs of State. They never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tir out of the Palace but four times a year, and they never &s;tay abroad above &s;ix days at a time, the Officers that attend them being put upon them by the <HI>Choua,</HI> who is as it were Lord high Con&s;table of the Kingdom. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ix days of liberty they go to vi&s;it the Temples, and the Prie&s;ts, to whom they give large Alms; the two next days they take their plea&s;ure in hunting; and the three la&s;t days they &s;pend their time upon the Rivers, in Galleys &s;umptuou&s;ly trimm'd and adorn'd&punc;</P>
<P>The Kingdom&punc; of <HI>Tunquin</HI> is divided into eight large Pro|vinces, every one of which has its Governour, and its Ma|gi&s;trates, from who&s;e &s;entence there lies an Appeal to the Court. We &s;hould wrong this Country to &s;ay that there were no Nobility therein&punc; as indeed there are none in mo&s;t Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> But they mu&s;t all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to this degree their merit; &s;ome by the Warrs, and &s;ome by their Learning&punc; They who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> them Nobility by Arms, have where with all to live hand&s;omly at home; and they begin to learn their Exerci&s;es betimes&punc; at farthe&s;t by eleven on twelve years of&punc; Age. The fir&s;t thing they are to under&s;tand, is how to handle their Swords&punc; the Blades of which are &s;treight, long, and broad, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> having but one Edge. They are al&s;o taught to aim with their Bows,
<PB N="36" REF="444">
and to fire a Musket with Matches, (for they know not the u&s;e of Fire-Locks) to ride the great Hor&s;e, to &s;hoot running, and to manage their <HI>Zagay's,</HI> which are a &s;ort of Staves, cheek'd with Iron, like a Half-Pike. When they are ready in all the&s;e Exerci&s;es, then they learn to make all &s;orts of Artificial Fire-works; as al&s;o how to in|vent new ones, to make u&s;e of them again&s;t the Elephants. By the way I mu&s;t needs tell you, there are &s;ome of the&s;e Ele|phants as I have &s;een &s;everal times, that are &s;o accu&s;tom'd to the&s;e Artificial Fires, that they regard them not at all, neither are any way di&s;turb'd at the Squibs that are thrown, and go off under their very No&s;es and Bellies. Neverthe|le&s;s of 200 of the&s;e Creatures&punc; which the Ea&s;tern Kings carry to their Wars at a time, you &s;hall have hardly fifteen that are &s;o hardy and valiant. So that unle&s;s their Gover|nours take not great care, in&s;tead of running upon the Enemy, they turn upon their Friends, and put the whole Army into a mo&s;t di&s;mal confu&s;ion; as you &s;hall hear by the following Story. For <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> being then a young Prince, obtain'd of <HI>Cha-geha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> his Father, to let him have the command of an Army of three &s;core thou&s;and Men, and four&s;core Ele|phants; and with this force, out of his Antipathy to the Chri&s;tians, he laid Siege to <HI>Daman,</HI> a Town belonging to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> fourteen Leagues from <HI>Surat.</HI> The Gover|nour wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a per&s;on of great Valour, and had al&s;o two Sons with him, who, together with him&s;elf, had both &s;erv'd the King of <HI>France.</HI> He had al&s;o in the Town eight hun|dred Gentlemen, who voluntarily put them&s;elves into the Garri&s;on for its defence, from all parts of <HI>India</HI> where the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had to do&punc; and were all excellently well mounted. For the <HI>Portugals</HI> at that time made u&s;e of none but <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;es, the wor&s;t of which co&s;t a thou&s;and Crowns at lea&s;t. The Governour finding that the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince began to pre&s;s hard upon him, having already made two A&s;&s;aults, re&s;olv'd with all his Cavalry and Infantry to make a Salley upon <HI>Sun|day</HI> Morning, cau&s;ing them to fix at the ends of their Spears and Lances certain Artificial Fire-works, to which they were order'd &s;uddenly to give fire, as &s;oon as they &s;hould gain the Elephants Quarter. This de&s;ign was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that when it came to be executed, the Elephants were &s;o &s;uddenly
<PB N="37" REF="444">
terrifi'd, that running impetuou&s;ly through the <HI>Indian</HI> Army; they trod to the ground, and cut in pieces with the Swords and Scithes which were fa&s;ten'd to their Trunks, what ever &s;tood in their way. The <HI>Portugals</HI> taking advantage of this confu&s;ion, made no le&s;s havock among the amazed Multi|tude, whom they had &s;urpriz'd &s;ecurely and profoundly a&s;leep. For they had an opinion, that the <HI>Portugals</HI> would never attack them upon the Sabboth day, believing they had the &s;ame veneration for that day which the <HI>Jews</HI> had. But they were utterly deceiv'd, in &s;o much that the <HI>Portu|gals,</HI> by virtue of this Stratagem &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, obtain'd a notable Victory, to the utter de&s;truction of 20000 of <HI>Aurenge-Zebe</HI>'s Army, the &s;poils whereof are reported to have amounted to above twelve Millions.</P>
<P>But to return to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have often wag'd War again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the fir&s;t would not pay the latter the Tribute which was accorded them by a Treaty made by one of their Kings, of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Le.</HI> But in the year 1667; the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> &s;eeing that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Country, made a Peace with the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> wherein it was agreed, that the &s;aid Tribute &s;hould be no longer paid; but that they &s;hould every year &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador only to <HI>Pequin,</HI> to do homage to the Emperour of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Ju&s;tice and Policy, they ob&s;erve a very exact Order and Regulation over all the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> as well in their Cities, as in the Country. So that few of the be&s;t regulated Kingdoms exceed them. More e&s;pecially they have a great care, for the public good, to repair the Bridges and High-ways; and every quarter of a League there is &s;uch Provi&s;ion made, that any Traveller may there meet not only with Water, but Fire al&s;o to light his Pipe, being generally great &s;moakers of Tobacco.</P>
<P>As for Murder, they are very exact in puni&s;hing that crime. For they carry the Per&s;on apprehended before the Judge; and then he mu&s;t hold to his Mouth a little wi&s;p of Gra&s;s, to &s;hew, that by his di&s;orderly life he had made him&s;elf a Bea&s;t. Not much unlike this is the cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the King and his Council condemn or pardon all but &s;uch as have murder'd a Man that has any Kindred. For then all the favour that the King can &s;hew him is, to
<PB N="38" REF="445">
deliver him into the hands of the next of kin to the Per&s;on kill'd, who has power to agree with the Criminal for a Sum of Money, which is rarely done, as being accounted an Act both infamous and ignominious. So that if there be no agreement made, then it behoves the next of kin to be the Executioner him&s;elf, and put the Criminal to that death to which he is before condemn'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Court of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALthough the King, as I have already &s;aid, have not much Authority in his Kingdom, which is govern'd altogether by the General, who has the whole <HI>Militia</HI> at his Devotion, yet he is highly honour'd by his Subjects, and he keeps a very &s;plendid Court. The fir&s;t and fifteenth day of every Month, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> who are the Grandees of the Kingdom, are bound to come in their <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Habits to ki&s;s the King's hands. The Con|&s;table, or General, was formerly wont to perform the &s;ame Office, but by degrees he has obtain'd a di&s;pen&s;ation, and only &s;ends another Prince in his &s;tead. As for all the other <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Governours of Provinces, Ju&s;ticiaries, and Military Officers, every year they go to ki&s;s the <HI>Choua</HI>'s hands, and to congratulate him upon the fir&s;t day of the year, which is the fifteenth of the fifth Month; as al&s;o when he has obtain'd any great Victory over his Enemies. So that the General has more Honour done him then the King him&s;elf. 'Tis al&s;o the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> among the Men, that when they meet any Per&s;on higher in condi|tion then them&s;elves, they make four profound obey&s;ances to the very Earth&punc; But for the Women, what over their condition be among them&s;elves, they never make but one. They who are de&s;irous to be admitted into the Palace to &s;ee the King, are oblig'd to put on Violet Robes, and their Servants mu&s;t be clad in the &s;ame colour. They that ap|proach the King's pre&s;ence, to obtain any favour, mu&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="445">
carry a Pre&s;ent along with him. For though the Con&s;table be the per&s;on that di&s;po&s;es of all Offices and Commands over all the Court and Kingdom, yet every year upon the fifteenth day of the &s;eventh Month, the King di&s;tributes &s;everal con&s;iderable Gifts and Large&s;&s;es to his Courtiers; as al&s;o to the Children of &s;uch Fathers who have perform'd any important Service for the good of his Kingdom. He gives them Pains of Gold, every one worth &s;ix hundred <HI>Livres;</HI> and Bars of Silver, amounting each to forty &s;ix <HI>Livres.</HI> The &s;ame day he al&s;o relea&s;es all Pri&s;oners, both Criminal and Debtors, provided the crime do not de&s;erve death; and that the debt do not exceed two Bars of Silver. Al&s;o every year, the three la&s;t days of the la&s;t Month, the 40 <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who are the chief Councellors of State, take the Oaths of all the Lords and Officers of the Court, and of their Wives; cau&s;ing them to &s;wear to be faithful to the King, and if they know of any thing that concerns the King's per&s;on, or his Kingdom, to di&s;cover it. All Go|vernours of Provinces give the &s;ame Oaths to the Lords and Gentlemen under their Juri&s;dictions; and the Governours of Cities to the Citizens, and other Inhabitants. They that di&s;cover any Trea&s;on never fail of any reward; only with this di&s;tinction, in reference to the quality of the Per|&s;ons that reveal it. For as for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Gentle|men, the King rewards them according to his own plea|&s;ure: But as for the meaner &s;ort, whether Men or Women, they are ennobl'd, and gratifi'd with a reward of 50 Pains of Gold, and 500 Bars of Silver, which in all amounts to 53000 <HI>Livres.</HI> But they e&s;teem their Nobility far beyond their Money.</P>
<P>At certain times of the year, there is a Mu&s;ter of the Youth of the &s;everal Provinces; and all tho&s;e who are found not to be either of the Nobility, or not to have learnt any Trade, are pre&s;ently enroll'd for the Service of the King, who every five years make choice of &s;uch as he in|tends for his Guard, and &s;ends them to the Frontier Garri|&s;ons. There are &s;ome who endeavour to get off by Money; but if they be di&s;cover'd, both the Officers and the Soldier are puni&s;h'd without redemption. For they hang a little Bell about his Neck, Fetter his Arms, and in that po&s;ture &s;end him to the Con&s;table, who pre&s;ently orders his Head
<PB N="40" REF="446">
to be &s;truck off. But in regard the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are very aver&s;e from &s;eeing any Blood &s;hed, the Kindred or Friends of the condemn'd Per&s;on, intercede that he may be hang'd, be|lieving that death to be mo&s;t honourable which is not defil'd with Blood-&s;hed; wherein they &s;eem to be of the Opinion of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ceremonies ob&s;erv'd when the Kings of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are advanc'd to the Throne.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we &s;peak of the Enthroning the Kings of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and of the Ceremonies that attend it, it behoves us to relate the manner of their &s;etting out of the Palace, when they go at any time to take their plea|&s;ure. The King is &s;eated upon a mo&s;t magnificent <HI>Palan|quin,</HI> carry'd by eight Men, where he may be beheld by all the People; the Lords and Officers of the Court attend|ing him on foot, provided he do not go out of the City: for when he goes into the Country he rides upon an Ele|phant, and the Lords follow him on Hor&s;e-back. When the Queen Mother, or his fir&s;t Wife go abroad, they are likewi&s;e carry'd upon a clo&s;e <HI>Palanquin,</HI> with Lattice-Win|dows, to the end, they may &s;ee and not be &s;een; and behind the <HI>Palanquin</HI> follow the Maids of Honour on foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and great Princes, &s;olemnize their Birth|days every year, with great Fea&s;ting, Pa&s;times, Come|dies, and Fire-works, and all their Friends and Kindred fail not to attend them to honour the Solemnities. In the year 1645, the elde&s;t Son of the King, who was by his Father appointed for his Succe&s;&s;or, upon one of his Birth|days &s;hew'd the Court all the divertizements he could imagin, and the King who had a great affection for him, &s;ent him a thou&s;and Pains of Gold, and five hundred Bars of Silver, to the value of 120000 <HI>Livres.</HI> At which time, large Alms are di&s;tributed, e&s;pecially to poor Widows and Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="446">
When the King dies, and leaves &s;everal Sons, they &s;et up him whom (when alive) he cho&s;e for his Succe&s;&s;or. The third day after the Decea&s;e of the King, the Con&s;table with all the Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> the Lords of the Council, and all the Governours of Provinces, repair to the Prince's Ap|partment, where they pre&s;ent him with a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Habit, af|ter which having mounted him upon an Elephant, they bring him into one of the great Courts of his Palace, which is all covered with Cloth of Gold and Silver as with a Tent. There it is, that being placed upon a Throne magnifi|cently enrich'd, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> pro&s;trate them&s;elves up|on the Earth with their Heads downward; in which po|&s;ture having lain for &s;ome time, they ri&s;e, and clo&s;ing their Hands together, with their Arms and Eyes lifted up to Hea|ven, they &s;wear to the new King to be faithful to him till death. This fir&s;t Ceremony being over, the new King, to &s;hew him&s;elf liberal upon his fir&s;t coming to the Crown, cau&s;es four Panes of Gold, and &s;ix Bars of Silver, to be gi|ven to eve y one. But to di&s;tingui&s;h the Con&s;table from the re&s;t, he gives him twenty Panes of Gold, and forty Bars of Silver: and to the Pre&s;ident of the Council or Chancel|lour ten of Gold and twenty of Silver. The&s;e Pre&s;ents be|ing thus made, &s;everal Pieces of Artillery are fired round the Palace, accompanied with &s;everal Volleys of &s;mall Shot, there being then in Arms above 30000 Hor&s;e and Foot; and then the King is &s;et upon a magnificent <HI>Palan|quin,</HI> and the Con&s;table and chief of the Council ride before upon lovely Hor&s;es. Sixteen of the principal Officers of the Court carry the King, <HI>viz.</HI> eight Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and eight of the Council. And in this manner they &s;et forward to the Apartment of the decea&s;ed King, from whence all the Lords retire for two hours, except the Eunuchs; and then it is, that the Prince&s;&s;es, Ladies of the Court, and chief Wives of the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> come to ki&s;s the King's Hand, and congratulate his Advancement to the Throne. Which done, all the Lords return again to a noble Fea&s;t after the manner of the Countrey ready prepar'd. Their Viands are not &s;o delicate, nor &s;o deliciou&s;ly dre&s;s'd as ours, neither have they &s;o much variety. 'Tis true, they have tho&s;e <HI>Birds-nests,</HI> already mention'd, which they mix in the mo&s;t part of their Di&s;hes, which gives the Meat a ta&s;t of
<PB N="42" REF="447">
almo&s;t all &s;orts of Spices. Of all the Meats which they eat Colts Fle&s;h is in mo&s;t e&s;teem, and Dogs Fle&s;h, neither of which agree with our Palates. The Fe&s;tival is concluded with Comedies and Fireworks, which la all&s;t the night. The next day the 30000 Men that gave their Volleys of &s;mall Shot the day before, are drawn up in good order in a Field next, and all the principal Officers of War, Colonels, Captains, and Lieutenants, leave the Frontiers to be at the &s;ame place. Then the King mounted upon his <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and carried by &s;ixteen of his principal Officers, the Con&s;ta|ble and grand Squire riding before, and attended by &s;everal other Commanders on foot, with &s;everal Mummers that play and dance before the <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> goes forth of his Pa|lace, the Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, and other Warlike In|&s;truments, filling the Air with their Martial Sounds. In this Pomp, and with this Equipage, the King being come to the Camp, quits his <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and mounts one of his great Elephants of War, which are us'd to the noi&s;e of the Guns and &s;ight of the Fireworks. Being thus mounted, he rides into the middle of all his Troops, in which place all the Officers &s;wear Fidelity to him; after which he be&s;tows his Gifts upon them, to every Colonel two Panes of Gold, and forty Bars of Silver; to every Captain the half of what he gives a Colonel, and to every Lieutenant the half of what he gives a Captain: and as for the Souldiers, they have every one a Moneths Pay. The&s;e Pre&s;ents being made, the whole Army di&s;charges three Volleys, and then every Com|pany retreats into a large Hutt, where they have Meat and Drink prepar'd for them, enough to &s;erve them a whole day and a night. In the &s;ame Field is al&s;o &s;et up a fair woo|den Palace, &s;umptuou&s;ly enriched within with Paintings and &s;everal pieces of Workman&s;hip in Gold. There the King &s;pends all the night, &s;ome part in Fea&s;ting, &s;ome part in Plays and &s;eeing the Mummers dance, and the re&s;t in be|holding the Fireworks. The next day the King leaves his wooden Palace, which is afterwards fir'd by the Souldiers, as well as their own Hutts, and &s;o returns to the City. Be|ing arrived at his Palace with the &s;ame pomp that he went forth, he &s;eats him&s;elf upon his Throne, and there &s;hews his Liberality to tho&s;e that made the Fireworks, to the Come|dians and Dancers, and all the re&s;t that were any way con|tributary,
<PB N="43" REF="447">
to the &s;etting forth the Pomp of the Ceremony. Then he gives Acce&s;s to all the People, and two Commi&s;&s;i|oners, one for the Merchants, and the other for the Handi|crafts, make a Speech to the King, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof is; that all the Burge&s;&s;es and Inhabitants of the good City of <HI>Checo</HI> do acknowledge him for their King, and that they will be faithful to him till death. The Speech being ended, the King pre&s;ents the Body of the Merchants with 50 Panes of Gold, and 300 Bars of Silver; and the Body of the Trade&s;|men with 20 Panes of Gold, and 100 Bars of Silver. The People gone home, every one &s;trives who &s;hall &s;pend mo&s;t in Fea&s;ting and Comedies, adding of their own to the Kings Bounty; &s;o that every Quarter of the City is full of Jollity and Rejoycing for a week together. Some days after come the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Commonalty, from all parts of the Kingdom, who in the behalf of their Cities and Towns make known to His Maje&s;ty the univer&s;al Joy of the People for their lawful Prince, a&s;&s;uring him of their Fidelity, and of their Service again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> They name particularly the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> have no greater Ene|mies than they, and for that the Hatred between them is ir|reconcileable. The King ob&s;erving the good will of his Peo|ple, te&s;tifies his Acknowledgment in this manner: All that have not time out of mind been Rebels to their lawful Sovereigns, but have con&s;tantly taken up Arms for their Defence, are di&s;charged for a year from all Taxes and Im|po&s;itions; and for the re&s;t, who have at any time formerly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Enemy, they are onely exempted for &s;ix moneths. All Pri&s;oners for Debt partake al&s;o of the King's Bounty, &s;o that after the Pre&s;ident of the Council has made a Compo|&s;ition with the Creditors for half the Summe, the King pays the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a thing almo&s;t incredible, what a va&s;t number of Sa|crifices the King &s;ends to the Temples of his fal&s;e Gods, to be there offer'd to the Idols.</P>
<P>The number of Bea&s;ts is &s;aid to exceed an hundred thou|&s;and, be&s;ides the value of a million in Panes of Gold, Ti&s;&s;ues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ilks, to adorn the Idols, and Orange-coloured Calicuts for the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and tho&s;e that attend the Service of the <HI>Pa|gods.</HI> Among the re&s;t of the&s;e Pre&s;ents he &s;ends a va&s;t num|ber of Pieces of blue Calicuts for the poor people that are
<PB N="44" REF="448">
kept in the <HI>Pagods,</HI> as our Poor are kept in Ho&s;pitals. The Idolatrous Princes al&s;o con&s;ume incredible Summes to adorn the <HI>Pagods</HI> and Images of their fal&s;e Gods. There are &s;ome of them three foot high, all of ma&s;&s;y Gold; others of Silver bigger than the Life.</P>
<P>The new King after all the&s;e Ceremonies are over, takes his time to go and give thanks to his fal&s;e Deities for his co|ming to the Crown when the Moon fir&s;t changes, &s;hutting him&s;elf up for the fir&s;t week with the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and living in common with them with a great deal of Frugality.</P>
<P>During this time he vi&s;its the principal Ho&s;pitals, to &s;ee how the poor people are us'd, e&s;pecially the old Folks, whom they have in great Veneration, to whom he di&s;tri|butes new Alms; for naturally the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> are very charitable. To conclude, he makes choice of &s;ome fair Situation, where he orders the building of a new <HI>Pagod,</HI> which he devotes to &s;ome of his Idols. Thus his Devotion being ended, upon the fir&s;t day of the &s;econd Quarter, he mounts one of his Elephants of War, attended by all the Officers of his Court on Hor&s;e-back, and ten or twelve thou&s;and men on foot, cho&s;en out of the whole Army to attend him. All the &s;econd Quarter the whole Court &s;tays in a certain Plain, where are three Hou&s;es &s;et up, one for the King, one for the Con&s;table, and one for the Pre&s;ident of the Council; with a world of Huts for the re&s;t. There are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall Cabins &s;et up, which are not covered and clo&s;ed but upon one &s;ide, which they turn as the Wind blows; and the&s;e are the places where they dre&s;s their Vi|ctuals: For at that time the King allows two meals a day to all his Attendants.</P>
<P>Through this Plain runs the River of&mdash;which is very broad in that place. Upon this River are &s;everal Galleys richly gilded and painted, but e&s;pecially the Ad|miral, which exceeds all the re&s;t in Magnificence. The Prow, the Poop, the Ropes, the Oars, but onely that part which goes into the water, glitter all with Gold; the Ben|ches very ingeniou&s;ly painted, the Rowers well clad. For there the Rowers are all Souldiers and Freemen, contrary to the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Souldiers in their youth are taught to handle their Oars, and have &s;omewhat better Pay than the Land-Souldiers. The Galleys are not &s;o big as
<PB N="45" REF="448">
ours, but they are longer, and cut the water better. While the King &s;tays in this place, he diverts him&s;elf with &s;eeing the&s;e Galleys row one again&s;t another. In the Evening the Rowers come a&s;hoar with their Captains to ki&s;s the King's Hand, and they that have behav'd them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;toutly and nimbly, carry off the Marks of his Bounty. The &s;even days being pa&s;t, the King calls before him all the Souldiers of the Galleys with their Officers, and gives them two moneths Wages extraordinary, as he does to his Land-Souldiers. 'Tis a wonderful thing to behold the va&s;t num|ber of Fireworks which they throw about, as well upon the Land as upon the Water. For my Brother, who has been pre&s;ent at all the&s;e Shews, has told me, that for the&s;e &s;even days together you would think the Air and Water all on fire. Being at <HI>Bantam</HI> I once &s;aw one of the&s;e artificial Firework-Shews which the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> that were there plaid off before the King, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was quite another thing from what we make in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;even days being pa&s;t, the King returns to the City in the &s;ame order, and with the &s;ame pomp, as he went forth&punc; and being come to his Palace, he goes directly to the Apartment of his Prince&s;&s;es&punc; where none but his Eu|nuchs accompany him, where he &s;tays all the re&s;t of the moneth. Every Evening he diverts him&s;elf with new Fire|works, which are plaid off before the Womens Lodgings; where al&s;o the Eunuchs, together with the Comedians and Mummers, contribute to diverti&s;e the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and of their manner of Burying their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen the King of <HI>Tunquin</HI> dies, he is pre&s;ently Embalm'd and laid in a Bed of State, where for &s;ixty five days the People have liberty to come and &s;ee him. All that time he is &s;erv'd as he was when he was alive; and when the Meat is taken from be|fore the Body, one half is given to the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and the other half to the Poor. So &s;oon as the King hath breath'd his la&s;t ga&s;p, the Con&s;table gives notice thereof to the Go|vernours of Provinces, and orders them how long they &s;hall Mourn.</P>
<P>All the Military <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Judges wear Mourning generally three years, the King's Hou&s;hold nine moneths, the Nobility &s;ix, and the meaner &s;ort three moneths. Du|ring the&s;e three years there is a Ce&s;&s;ation from all Diver|ti&s;ements, except tho&s;e that attend the Ceremony of the King's Advance or Elevation to the Throne. All the Vi|ands which are &s;erv'd up to the King are verni&s;h'd with Black. The King cuts his Hair, and covers his Head with a Bonnet of Straw, as do likewi&s;e all the Princes and Coun|&s;ellors of State; neither do they leave off that Habit till the King's Body be in the Galley which is to carry him to his Enterment. Three Bells which hang in one of the Tow|ers of the Palace, never leave tolling from the King's ex|piring till the Corps be put into the Galley. The third day after his Decea&s;e all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> repair to Court, to te&s;ti|fie their &s;orrow which they have for the Death of the de|cea&s;ed King, and ten days after that the People are allow|ed to &s;ee the Body lie in State, till it be put into the Galley.</P>
<P>During the &s;ixty five days that the Body is thus expos'd, the Con&s;table is bu&s;ie in preparing for the Funeral Pomp. From the Palace to the place where the Galleys wait for the Body, it is about two days Journey, and all the way</P>

<P>The King's Body is put into a Galley, which is drawn up the Ri|ver. This River is increa&s;ed by &s;everal Brooks that come down from the Mountains, and it runs through barren and De&s;art Coun|tries. In &s;ome of the&s;e places they are wont to bury the Corps very privately; for &s;ix onely of the chief Eunuchs of the Court are to know where the King hath been buried. An Oath is tendered to them ne|ver to reveal the place. And this is done perhaps on &s;ome Religious Motive, and likewi&s;e through Fear, that the Trea&s;ures which are buried by him &s;hould be digged up. The&s;e Riches are ordinarily &s;ome Ma&s;&s;y Bars of Gold and Silver, as likewi&s;e &s;ome Pieces of Cloth of Gold and Silver, and &s;uch kinds of other rich Furnitures, which he is to make u&s;e of (as they &s;ay) when he hath need of them in the other World. Many Lords and Ladies of the Court will needs be buried Alive with him, for to &s;erve him in the places where he is to go.

After the Pomp is over, and that the King is returned home, the Cloth is taken up and given to the <HI>Bonzes.</HI></P>
<P>As to the order of their March it is thus: The two men that go formo&s;t of all, are the two U&s;hers of the Door of the King's Chamber, who go repeating aloud the Name of the decea&s;ed King, carrying each of them a Mace of Arms, the bole whereof is full of artificial Fireworks. The twelve that follow, are the twelve chief Officers of the Galley, which draw the Tomb whereon the King's Name is written. Then follows the grand Squire on Hor&s;eback, attended by two others. Next appear twelve led Hor&s;es, which are led two by two, &s;ix of which have their Bridles enrich'd with thin Plates of Gold, and their Saddles embroydered. The other &s;ix with Bridles of Gold, and Hou&s;&s;es embroidered, and fring'd about with a Gold and Silver Fringe; every Hor&s;e being led by two men. Next to them follow twelve Elephants, four which carry each of them a man carrying a Standard; four others which carry each of them a Tower with &s;ix men apiece, &s;ome with Mu&s;|quets, others with Fire Lances; the four la&s;t carry each of them a kind of a Cage, of which one is made with Gla&s;s Windows before and upon each &s;ide; the other like a kind of a Lattice, and the other with four kinds of Ruffs: and the&s;e are the King's Elephants which he rode upon when he went to the Wars. Behind them follow eight Hor&s;es, eve|ry one of them led by a Captain of the Guard, who draw the Her&s;e. The new King, and his Brothers if he have any, or the Princes of the Bloud, follow the Her&s;e, clad in Robes of White Satten, which is their Mourning Colour. La&s;tly follow two Chariots, each one drawn by eight Hor|&s;es, and carrying two Coffers, wherein are the Panes of Gold, Bars of Silver, rich Ti&s;&s;ues and Habits, which are to be buried with the Body of the decea&s;ed King.</P>

<HEAD>The Funerals of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS fer the ordinary Funerals of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es,</HI> they are more or le&s;s pompous, according to the Quality of the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>At their Enterments they u&s;e great &s;tore of artificial Fire|works, which are the Companions as well of their Sorrow as their Joy. They &s;et upon the Tomb of the decea&s;ed good &s;tore of Victuals and Comfitures, out of a belief that the dead are the better for them. For their Prie&s;ts keep them in that blind Error for their own advantage, and &s;o well order their bu&s;ine&s;s, that there is nothing left by morn|ing. The &s;ame thing is practi&s;ed by the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> at <HI>Bata|via,</HI> where they have a place without the Town to bury their dead, which puts me in mind of this Story: Every evening the Guard is relieved as well in the City as in the Fortre&s;s. At the &s;ame time al&s;o they put forth eight Souldi|ers and a Corporal at each Gate of the City, who go the Rounds about the Walls of the City, and as far as within Ca|non-&s;hot of the Walls, being fearful of being &s;urpri&s;ed by the King of <HI>Mataran,</HI> or <HI>Bontam,</HI> their Capital Enemies. Now becau&s;e the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> burying place lay in the Walk of the&s;e Souldiers, when they &s;aw the Provant upon one of the Tombs, took it away to their Guard, and there fea&s;ted them|&s;elves. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Prie&s;ts, that u&s;ually came about mid|night to take away the Victuals, finding them&s;elves &s;everal times bereaved of their Expectations, and &s;u&s;pecting the Souldiers belonging to the <HI>Holland</HI> Garri&s;on, fir&s;t complain|ed to the General and Council; but that not taking effect, they re&s;olved to poi&s;on both the Meat and the Drink, to prevent the like Fraud for the future. This took &s;o good effect, that afterwards many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Souldiers being poi&s;oned, deterr'd the re&s;t from any more &s;uch Licori&s;h At|tempts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion and Superstition of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> as to matters of Religion are divided into three Sects: The fir&s;t takes its original from an ancient Philo&s;opher called <HI>Confutius,</HI> who&s;e Me|mory is very famous over all <HI>China,</HI> and the neighbouring Countries. Their Doctrine a&s;ferts that Man is compos'd of two parts, the one fine and &s;ubtil, the other material and gro&s;s; and that when Man dies, the &s;ubtiler part goes into the Air, and the gro&s;&s;er part &s;tays in the Earth. This Sect maintains the u&s;e of Sacrifices, and adores the &s;even Planets. But among all their Gods and Idols they have four in parti|cular veneration; the Names of the&s;e Gods are <HI>Rauma, Be|tolo, Ramonu,</HI> and <HI>Brama.</HI> They have a Godde&s;s al&s;o, who&s;e Name is <HI>Satisbana,</HI> which is &s;he whom the Women adore; but for the King and the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> e&s;pecially the more &s;tu|dious &s;ort, they adore the Heavens. The &s;econd Sect had &s;o its Founder a certain Hermite called <HI>Chacabout;</HI> and is followed by the mo&s;t part of the meaner people. He has taught them the Tran&s;migration of Souls, and has enjoyn'd his Followers to ob&s;erve 10 Commandments.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, That they &s;hall not kill. 2. That they &s;hall not &s;teal. 3. That they &s;hall not defile their Bodies- 4. That they &s;hall not lye. 5. That they &s;hall not be un|faithful in their words. 6. That they &s;hall re&s;train their in|ordinate De&s;ires. 7. That they &s;hall do injury to no man. 8. That they &s;hall not be great Talkers. 9. That they &s;hall not give way to their Anger. 10. That they &s;hall labour to their utmo&s;t to get Knowledge.</P>
<P>As for them that de&s;ign to live a Religious Life, they mu&s;t renounce the Delights of this Life, be charitable to the poor, overcome their Pa&s;&s;ions, and give them&s;elves up to Medita|tion. He taught moreover, that after this Life there were ten di&s;tinct places of Joy and Torment: and that the Con|temners of this Law &s;hould feel Torments proportionable
<PB N="50" REF="455">
to their Offences, without any end of their Torments. That they that endeavour'd to fulfill his Law, and had fail'd in any point, they &s;hould wander in divers Bodies for 3000 years before they entered into happine&s;s. But that they who had perfectly obeyed his Law, &s;hould be rewarded without &s;uffering any change of Body. And that he him&s;elf had been born ten times, before he enjoyed the Bli&s;s which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not having in his fir&s;t Youth been illuminated with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained. This <HI>Chacabout</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Impo&s;tors that ever was in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> having &s;pread his Opinions over all the Kingdom of <HI>Stam,</HI> over a great part of the Provinces of <HI>Japon,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where he died.</P>
<P>The third Sect is that of <HI>Lanthu,</HI> to who&s;e Fables the <HI>Ja|ponne&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> give great credence, but the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> more. He was a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> by Nation, and one of the great|e&s;t Magicians in the Ea&s;t. He made a great many Di&s;ciples, who to authorize this black Impo&s;tor, and the more to im|po&s;e upon the people, made them believe that the Birth of <HI>Lanthu</HI> was miraculous, and that his Mother carried him in her Womb, without lo&s;ing her Virginity, &s;eventy years. He taught much of <HI>Chacabout</HI>'s Doctrine; but that which won the Hearts of the people was, that he &s;till exhorted the Grandees to build Ho&s;pitals in all Cities where there had been none before. In&s;omuch that &s;everal of the Nobility betook them&s;elves to tho&s;e places to look after the Sick, as did al&s;o a great number of the <HI>Bonzes</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on. While my Brother was there, the <HI>Cho&uuml;a,</HI> a great Enemy to the&s;e Vagabonds, &s;ent for a great number of <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says,</HI> or idle Fellows, and picking out the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t proportion'd, &s;ent them away to the Frontiers for Soul|diers.</P>
<P>'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> to adore three things in their Hou&s;es: The fir&s;t is the Hearth of their Chimney made of three Stones The &s;econd is an Idol which they call <HI>Tien&s;a,</HI> which is the Patrone&s;s of Handicrafts, as Sculp|ture, Painting, Gold&s;mith's work, &amp;c. So that when they put forth a Child to learn any of tho&s;e Trades, before they let him work they &s;et up an Altar; and &s;acrifice to this Idol, to the end he may infu&s;e into the Lad wit and aptne&s;s to learn. The third is the Idol <HI>Buabin,</HI> which they implore
<PB N="51" REF="455">
when they de&s;ign to build an Hou&s;e. For then they erect an Altar, and &s;end for the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> to &s;acrifice to this Idol. To this purpo&s;e they make great preparation of all &s;orts of Viands, and then pre&s;ent him with &s;everal gilt Papers, wherein are written &s;everal Magic words, endea|vouring by that means that he may not &s;uffer any misfortune to befall the Hou&s;e they are going to build.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> that adore the Heaven, others the Moon, and others the Stars There are al&s;o &s;ome that adore five parts of the Earth, making a fifth part in the middle of that which is known to us, and to them al&s;o, but confu&s;edly. When they wor&s;hip them, they have for each of the parts a particular Colour. When they adore the Northern part, they clothe them&s;elves in black; and the Di&s;hes and Table whereon they lay their Sacrifices are like|wi&s;e black. When they wor&s;hip the South their Habit is red; when the Ea&s;t, green; when the We&s;t, white; and when they adore the middle of the World, they wear Yellow.</P>
<P>They offer Offerings likewi&s;e to Trees, Elephants, Hor&s;es, Cows, and almo&s;t to all other &s;orts of Animals. They that &s;tu|dy the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Characters are accu&s;tomed every fifth moneth of the year, to &s;acrifice for the Souls of the dead who were never buried. They believe that by &s;o doing their Under|&s;tandings &s;hall be more enlightned for the apprehending of all things.</P>
<P>Every year, at the beginning of the year, they have a great Solemnity, to honour after their death tho&s;e who in their life-time have done any noble action, and were re|nowned for their Valour, reckoning in that number tho&s;e that have been &s;o hardy as to rebel again&s;t their Princes, as being men of Courage. Three days before this great So|lemnity, which is perform'd in a large Field, they &s;et up &s;everal Altars, &s;ome for the Sacrifices, others for the Names of the Illu&s;trious Men whom they de&s;ign to honour. The Eve before above 40000 Souldiers &s;pend the night in this Plain, where all the Princes and <HI>Mandarins</HI> are ordered to meet with their Elephants and led Hor&s;es, and the King him&s;elf goes thither in per&s;on. After they have fini&s;hed all their Sacrifices, and burnt good &s;tore of Incen&s;e to the Honour of the dead, the King and all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make three pro|found
<PB N="52" REF="456">
Reverences where the Altars are; then the King &s;hoots with his Bow and Arrows five times again&s;t the Al|tars, where lie the Names of tho&s;e that were &s;o ra&s;h as to rebel again&s;t their Sovereigns. After that the great Guns go off, and the Souldiers give three Volleys of &s;mall Shot, to put all the Souls to flight. Then they burn all the Al|tars, and a great number of gilt Papers, which were made u&s;e of at the Sacrifices; concluding all with a mo&s;t hideous &s;hout of all the Souldiery. Which done, the <HI>Bonzes, Says,</HI> and &s;uch like people, come and devour the Meat that was made u&s;e of for the Sacrifices.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and fifteenth days of the Moneth 'tis a wonder|ful thing to hear the Chiming Din of their great Bells. For tho&s;e are the more e&s;pecial Holydays &s;et apart for the Wor|&s;hip of their Gods, and all the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> give them more than ordinary Wor&s;hip upon tho&s;e days, redoubling their Prayers, and repeating upon tho&s;e days every one of them a &s;trange kind of Charm &s;ix times over. At the&s;e times &s;everal people bring Meat and Drink to the Sepul|chres of their Kindred, to &s;acrifice for the good of their Souls to eat. The <HI>Bonzes</HI> fail not to be there, and when the others have paid their Devoirs the <HI>Bonzes</HI> fall to, and what they cannot eat they give to the poor.

<P>The <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> al&s;o have a great veneration for two Magicians, and one Magiciane&s;s. The fir&s;t of their Magi|cians, whom they call <HI>Tay-bou,</HI> makes them believe that he knows the Events of things to come; &s;o that when they have any occa&s;ion to marry their Children, build a Hou&s;e, buy Land, or undertake any bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence, they con&s;ult this Oracle to know what &s;hall happen to them. The Magician courteou&s;ly receives them, and with a coun|terfeit mode&s;ty demands of them (for Example) the Age of the per&s;on concerned. Then taking into his hands a great Book about three fingers thick, wherein are the Figures of Men, half Men, and &s;everal &s;orts of Land and Water Ani|mals, of Circles, Triangles, and Squares, he goes to work, and at the &s;ame time puts into a Goblet three Pieces of Cop|per, whereon are engraven &s;everal Characters onely up|on one &s;ide. After he has &s;haken the Pieces in the Cup, he throws them upon the ground as at Cro&s;s and Pile; if all the Characters lie undermo&s;t he looks no further in his Book, but looks upon it as an unfortunate &s;ign; but if one or two Characters come up, he looks in his Book, and makes the per&s;on believe what he plea&s;es. But if all the Characters happen to turn uppermo&s;t, then the Magician cries out, that the Party is the mo&s;t fortunate in the world.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Magician is called <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy,</HI> to whom they have recour&s;e in all their Sickne&s;&s;es. When any &s;ick per&s;on comes to him, he takes a Book full of Figures like the former; onely the Form of the Book is different, for this is not above an inch thick, and about four fingers long, with eight Panes full of Cyphers. If after &s;everal Api&s;h tricks which he acts before the &s;ick per&s;on to amu&s;e him, he affirms that the Di&s;temper comes from the Devil, he him|&s;elf, together with the &s;ick party and they that brought him, do Homage to the evil &s;pirit: this Homage con&s;i&s;ts of &s;e|veral Sacrifices, and the Friends of the &s;ick party pre&s;ent to the Devil, or rather to the Magician, a Table furni&s;h'd with Rice and other Viands. But if after all the&s;e Offerings the
<PB N="54" REF="458">
&s;ick party do not recover his health, all the Friends and Kindred of the &s;ick party, with as many Souldiers as they can get, &s;urround the &s;ick per&s;ons Hou&s;e, and &s;hoot off their Mu&s;quets three times, to drive away the Devil. Some|times the Magician makes the &s;ick party and his Friends be|lieve, that the God of the Waters is the cau&s;e of the Di&s;tem|per, e&s;pecially if the &s;ick per&s;on belongs to the Water, as being a Mariner, Boatman, or Fi&s;herman. And to the end he may be cur'd, and that the appeas'd God may return to his watry Habitation, he orders that all the way from the &s;ick parties Hou&s;e to the next River may be &s;pread with all the Pieces of Stuff which all the Kindred have, and that they &s;et up Huts at &s;uch and &s;uch di&s;tances, and keep in eve|ry one a &s;everal Table furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Viands for 3 days. And all this to oblige the Deity to retire, and to en|tertain him till he gets home. But the better to know the ri&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy</HI> makes them believe, that they mu&s;t go and con&s;ult <HI>Thay-Bou,</HI> who is the chief Magician, and if he an&s;wer that the Souls of the dead have cau&s;ed the Di&s;temper, the Magician imploys all his tricks and devices to draw to him tho&s;e mi&s;chievous Souls; and when he has got into his Clutches, as he pretends, the Soul that is the Author of the Di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;huts him up in a Bottle full of Water till the party be cured; and then breaking the Bottle he &s;ets the Soul at liberty to go about his bu&s;ine&s;s. When the party recovers, he makes him and his Friends be|lieve, that if the Bottle had not been well &s;topp'd to keep in the Soul, their Kin&s;man would have died infallibly.</P>
<P>The Magiciane&s;s, which the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> al&s;o con&s;ult, is called <HI>Bacoti,</HI> and &s;he keeps a great Corre&s;pondence with the Devil, to whom, if &s;he has a Daughter, &s;he offers her as &s;oon as &s;he is born, the more to oblige him. If any Mo|ther bewail the death of her Child, and be de&s;irous to know in what condition the Soul of the Child is in, in the other world, &s;he goes to <HI>Bacoti,</HI> who to &s;atisfie the Mother pre|&s;ently falls a beating her Drum, to &s;ummon the Soul to come to her, who pre&s;ently appears, as &s;he pretends, and tells her its Condition whether good or bad. But mo&s;t commonly &s;he makes the &s;illy Mothers believe that the Soul is happy, and bids them be of good cheer.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="458">
The Super&s;titions of the&s;e people are very numerous, but the mo&s;t remarkable are the&s;e:</P>
<P>The &s;tudious &s;ort of people are very diligent to learn, how by looking in a Mirrour to foretell things to come.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that pre&s;ent <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> to the dead, and &s;prinkle their A&s;hes with it; but this onely upon the A&s;hes of their Ance&s;tors, from whom at the &s;ame time they beg for Health, Honour, and Riches.</P>
<P>Others there are, that upon the fir&s;t day of their year take a piece of Chalk, and make &s;everal Figures round, &s;quare, and triangular, upon the Thre&s;hold and Steps of their Doors. They &s;ay tho&s;e Figures fright away the evil &s;pirits. Some there are that make great Ob&s;ervations upon the Feet of their Hens, and draw &s;trange Conclu&s;ions of bad or ill fortune from thence. Others travelling into the Countrey, if they &s;neeze but once by the way, return to the place from whence they parted in the morning, &s;aying, That had they gone on, &s;ome mi&s;chief would have certainly befallen them: but if they &s;neeze twice, they pur&s;ue their Journey, never fear|ing any danger for that day.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that going out of their Hou&s;es, if they meet a Woman, they return home again for two or three hours; but if they meet a Man, 'tis a good <HI>Omen.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Fruit which they gather at the beginning of the year, is that which the <HI>Araguer</HI> bears, &s;poken of in the third Chapter. And this is the fir&s;t which they eat with great Ceremony, during the fir&s;t Quarter of their &s;econd Moneth. To which purpo&s;e they are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Devil, that they poy&s;on one of the&s;e Fruits, and give it to a Child to eat, believing that by taking away the life of the poor innocent Child, they &s;hall thrive the better all the year after.</P>
<P>When the Moon is eclip&s;ed, they &s;ay there is a certain Dragon that a&s;&s;ails her, and endeavours with all his might to overcome her, with an intention to devour her. Then to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Moon, and to put the Dragon to flight, they di&s;charge their Mu&s;quets, ring their Bells, beat up their Drums, and make a hideous noi&s;e till the Eclip&s;e be over: and then they believe that they have re&s;cued the Moon, for which they make as great a rejoycing, as if they had ob|tain'd &s;ome eminent Victory over their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="459">
They are al&s;o very &s;uper&s;titious in reference to the hours of the day. They divide the natural day into twelve hours, and to every one they give the name of &s;ome Bea&s;t, as of a Tiger, a Lion, a Bear, a Hor&s;e, a Dragon, an Ape, &amp;c. The Moneths al&s;o and Days have their particular Names: and when a Child is born, pre&s;ently the Father and Kindred go to &s;ee the name of the Bea&s;t by which the Hour was call'd wherein the Child was born; believing that Animal will prove fatal to it. At the time that my Brother was at the Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the King then reigning being born in the hour of the Hor&s;e, would never give Audience, nor ever &s;tir out of his Palace at that hour, for fear &s;ome mi&s;chief &s;hould befall him at that time. That Prince was &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that one of his Children dying in the fifth moneth, which bears the name of the Hor&s;e, he would never permit him to be enterr'd, but caus'd him to be burnt, and &s;catter'd his a&s;hes in the Air.</P>
<P>This is that which I could gather of mo&s;t remarkable and mo&s;t con&s;iderable matters concerning the State of the King|dom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> either out of the Manu&s;cripts which my Brother (who died in the <HI>Indies)</HI> left me, or from the Di&s;|cour&s;e which I have had with the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> them&s;elves both at <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Baravia.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the <HI>Hollanders</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it, and how it was taken from them by the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> is about Eighty Leagues in compa&s;s; &s;o that the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> were never in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole I&s;land, but were onely Ma&s;ters of four Fortre&s;&s;es, and two and fifty Villages, wherein they could number about four|teen or fifteen thou&s;and Inhabitants. As for that part which is under the <HI>Indians,</HI> the be&s;t di&s;covery that we can give, is onely &s;uch as was made by a young <HI>Hollander</HI> upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="460">
There was in the chief Fort belonging to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a young man, imployed there as an under Factor, who being wild and extravagant, was put out of his place and made a Souldier. He not able to undergo that mi&s;erable cour&s;e of life, re&s;olved with him&s;elf rather to die, than live in that mean condition. Thereupon having at &s;everal opportuni|ties made a &s;hift to make up a little Pack of what he thought was mo&s;t fit for the Mountainiers of the I&s;land, he watch'd his time and &s;tole out of the Fort, and took his way directly toward the Mountains. With the&s;e Highlanders he liv'd four years, in which time having learnt the Trade and Lan|guage of the Countrey, he ventur'd to return to the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> again, who received him kindly, as being willing to under&s;tand the Government of the People, and by what means they might traffick with them. Whereupon the young man made them this Relation.</P>
<P>As for the Government of the People he &s;aid, that over every &s;ix Villages there was an Over&s;eer with four Coun&s;el|lors, who admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice, and puni&s;h the &s;malle&s;t Theft with Death. The Men are crucified; the Women are laid along upon a thick Beam of Wood, and then with a Scimi|tar their Bodies are divided into three parts. The Men are &s;o puni&s;h'd for Theft or Murder, and the Women for Theft or Adultery. If it be a Pety Larceny, not above the value of a Shilling, they give them an hundred La&s;hes with a Whip, and burn them in the Cheek. They that believe them&s;elves to be unju&s;tly dealt with, whether in Civil or Criminal Cau&s;es, enter their Appeal to go to the North Ea&s;t part of the I&s;land, in which divi&s;ion of the I&s;land there &s;tands a City by the Sea-&s;ide, where he that commands all the Highlanders re&s;ides. At the end of our Moneth of <HI>March</HI> &s;everal of the&s;e Highlanders re&s;ort to this City, e&s;pecially the Merchants, who carry along with them all their whole Stock that they had hoarded together the year before in Horns of Oxen, Harts, Bufulo's, and Raw Hides, and then return again at the end of <HI>April,</HI> bringing back in return of their Commodities <HI>Japon</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Stuffs, Clothes, and Linen of the &s;ame Countrey, and Gold and Silver <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Money, of various Coyns and Value. He told them al&s;o, that he believed that in the Mountains near the Sea, there are certain Mines of Gold and Silver, or &s;ome River where
<PB N="59" REF="460">
they find it in Powder, and that the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> fetch it in their Ve&s;&s;els. He did all he could to di&s;cover the truth, but after he had travelled two or three days Journey, the People would let him go no further. For at the end of every three or four hours travel there are Guards &s;et, who examine all Travellers whither they go; neither will they let their own Countrymen pa&s;s, but &s;uch as go about their Law or to trade. Moreover he told them, that if they would give him Goods to trade withall, as Amber, Coral, Looking Gla&s;&s;es; but chiefly &s;ome Skins of the Sea Fi&s;h, which is rougher than Seal-skin, he would endeavour to get to the very City it &s;elf where the Ships ride. The&s;e Skins are greatly e&s;teemed by the Natives to adorn the Scabbards of their  Cutla&s;&s;es and Swords. For u&s;ually upon the back of this Fi&s;h you &s;hall find nine little Stones, which make a kind of a Ro&s;e, eight in a Circle and one in the middle, as you &s;ee the&s;e nine di&s;po&s;ed in their exact order. 
<FIGURE></FIGURE>
When the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> traded onely to <HI>Japon,</HI> it is incredible how dear they &s;old the&s;e Skins. For if Na|ture had well &s;et the&s;e Stones at an equal di&s;tance, and even in bigne&s;s, one of the&s;e Skins would yield above ten thou|&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters,</HI> and more. This Fi&s;h is caught in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, where I have &s;een of them, but I &s;aw but very few &s;o perfect as that which I have de&s;crib'd, which would in tho&s;e Countries yield ten thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>But to return to the Story; the Governour gave the young man what he de&s;ired, and &s;ent him going: but the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> &s;oon after expelling the <HI>Hollanders</HI> out of the I&s;land, it was never known what became of the young man.</P>
<P>It may be wondered why <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> was taken &s;o &s;oon: but here were two Rea&s;ons, fir&s;t the faint-heartedne&s;s of the Governour, and &s;econdly his breach of word to a <HI>French</HI> Souldier of <HI>Rouen,</HI> call'd <HI>Abraham du Puys;</HI> for he having &s;erved out his time of &s;even years, de&s;ir'd leave to be gone, but the Governour, after he had promis'd him fair at fir&s;t, at length ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him. Soon after the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> came to be&s;iege the place. The Souldier thus di&s;appointed, and &s;eeing him&s;elf coop'd up who might have been free, had the Governour &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;tudied a fatal revenge upon all his Countreymen; for being by this means grown de&s;perate,
<PB N="60" REF="461">
watch'd his opportunity, and flinging him&s;elf from the Fort into the Sea, &s;wam directly to the Enemy. The Gover|nour offered 200 Pieces of Eight to any per&s;on that would venture after him, and bring him back dead or alive. A Serjeant accepted his offer, but it was to get loo&s;e as the other had done; and &s;o they got both &s;afe into the Enemies Quarters. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> pre&s;ently carried them to the Ge|neral <HI>Coxima;</HI> and he being a per&s;on of Valour and Di&s;cre|tion, made very much of them, whereupon they readily and willingly inform'd him of the &s;trength and condition of the Fortre&s;s. They al&s;o advi&s;ed him to remove his Batte|ries to the weake&s;t part of the Town, whereas he was then a&s;&s;ailing it where it was mo&s;t &s;trongly fortified: which if he would do, they a&s;&s;ur'd him he &s;hould be &s;oon Ma&s;ter of the Fort. The General was thinking a little before they came to have rai&s;ed his Siege, but upon their encouragement he fell on again according to their direction; and as he was preparing for a general A&s;&s;ault, the <HI>Holland</HI> Commander, fearful of lo&s;ing his Life and his E&s;tate, beat a Parley, and &s;urrender'd the place upon Articles.</P>
<P>During the Siege the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a Salley, but were beaten in again, and fourteen of their men were taken Pri|&s;oners. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> finding tho&s;e fourteen men in their power, and remembering how cruel the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had been to their Nation when they took any of them at Sea, brought the fourteen men all together, put out one eye of each, cut off their No&s;es, Ears, and one hand, and &s;o &s;ent them back to the Fort, with order to tell the Commander, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had taught them that kind of Mercy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land, where they cut Ebony.</HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land call'd <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land lies almo&s;t in 84 degrees of Longitude, and 21 degrees of Southern Latitude, being but 2 degrees and 30 minutes from the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> right over again&s;t the middle of the great I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which it has upon the We&s;t, from whence it lies 140 Leagues, and is in compa&s;s about 60 Leagues. It bears great quantities of Ebony: and here it was that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did formerly &s;end their Slaves, their bani&s;h'd and condemn'd Per&s;ons, to cut that &s;ort of Wood, which is Labour much more &s;evere and cruel than that of Rowing in the Galleys. The whole I&s;land is &s;ubject to tho&s;e violent and outrageous Tempe&s;ts call'd <HI>Ouragans,</HI> which nothing can with&s;tand, &s;o that the People are forc'd to dig them&s;elves Holes in the ground, not being able to keep their Huts &s;tanding. Neither had the poor Creatures any other Food than a little boil'd Rice, and about a Farthings worth of Salt-fi&s;h among four for a whole day. Since that the Price of Ebony being brought very low, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have for&s;aken the I&s;land, the Profit not bearing the &s;orry Expen|ces which tho&s;e poor Creatures put them to.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as this Tree is cut down it mu&s;t be &s;awed into Planks, and then buried &s;even or eight foot deep in the Earth, which ought to be &s;omewhat moi&s;t. There tho&s;e Planks mu&s;t lie two years, and &s;ometimes three, if the Wood be very thick. After that the Wood is fit to be wrought up|on, neither will it &s;plinter or &s;plit, and will the &s;ooner ad|mit of a glittering Poli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land puts me in mind of a Story, that the Sieur <HI>Loocker</HI> told me, concerning what befell him in his Voyage from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Batavia</HI> in the Year 1643. <HI>Cha Abbas</HI> the &s;econd of that Name, King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> having a great de&s;ire to learn to paint, &s;ignified to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> that he de&s;ired them to &s;end into <HI>Holland</HI> for &s;ome
<PB N="62" REF="462">
per&s;on who was excellent both in De&s;igning and Painting. Thereupon the Chief of the Factory wrote into <HI>Holland,</HI> and upon his Letters the Company &s;ent away <HI>Loocker,</HI> to oblige the King; and to do him the greater honour, gave him the charge of Merchant of the Ve&s;&s;el, who is equal with the Captain, during the Voyage; to whom the Wind and Sea|&s;on was very favourable till they came to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> but after they had doubled the Point, the Pilots bare too much to the North, whereas they &s;hould have &s;teered directly Ea&s;t; &s;o that when they had made the Height of the I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> they met with nothing but contrary Winds. For it is ob&s;ervable, that all the year long there blows but one Wind toward <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land; &s;o that a Ship may go thither in eight or nine days, but cannot return in thirty or forty. For you mu&s;t &s;teer We&s;tward to 30 de|grees, and from thence Ea&s;tward to 14 or 15 degrees, and then you light upon <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land. Five days together the Ship was but rudely handled by the &s;torm; which at length grew &s;o violent, and the Sea &s;o boi&s;terous, that all the great Cabin was broken to pieces, the Beak of the Ship carried away, and the Forema&s;t made un&s;erviceable. Thir|teen days together they remained in this mi&s;erable conditi|on, to&s;s'd up and down by the Sea and Wind, all which time they never &s;aw the Sun, unable to take any height or ob|&s;ervation where they were. The fourteenth day it cleared up, and the Sun appeared, and then taking the Height they ob&s;erved them&s;elves to be not far from the <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land, which was very true; for the next day by break of day they found them&s;elves not above two Leagues from the I&s;land; and they found them&s;elves upon the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, whereas the <HI>Hollanders</HI> liv'd upon the South. And there|fore perceiving that if the Wind did not change, it would be a long time, and that with great difficulty too, before they could fetch a compa&s;s about the I&s;land to come to the Fort where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were, they call'd a Council, where it was re&s;olved that <HI>Loocker</HI> with ten Souldiers &s;hould be put on &s;hoar, and that he &s;hould endeavour to get to the Fort by Land, there to make provi&s;ion of Water and Refre&s;h|ments for the re&s;t of the Company, again&s;t they could come about. <HI>Maurice</HI> I&s;land has this advantage, to be furni&s;hed with excellent Water, and great &s;tore of Goats, Oranges,
<PB N="63" REF="462">
Citrons, and other Fruits: but when the <HI>Ouragans</HI> happen there is not one to be &s;een upon the Trees, unle&s;s onely up|on tho&s;e which are &s;helter'd by the Ebony Boughs, which are thick and &s;trong, and the Trees deeply rooted in the Earth. <HI>Loocker</HI> thereupon with ten Souldiers was put on &s;hoar in a Shallop, with Provi&s;ions for &s;ix days. Nor was the I&s;land in that part above eight or ten Leagues broad, which they thought to travel in few days: but the Woods were &s;o thick, that had they not been well provided of Car|penters Hatchets and Axes, they could never have made their way. The fir&s;t day they travell'd not above a League, and the next day not above as much more, being &s;till forced to hack their way along with great travel and pains. So that being now weary and &s;pent, they laid them&s;elves upon the ground to repo&s;e them&s;elves, and get a little &s;leep. When they wak'd they heard the voices of &s;everal people, which much rejoyced them, believing them to be the Slaves and poor Creatures that were cutting Ebony not far off. Thereupon they fell to work to get as near them as they could: but the Woods proved &s;o thick, that they de|&s;pair'd of doing any good. Neverthele&s;s the further they advanced, the clearer they could hear the voices of the peo|ple, &s;ome &s;peaking <HI>Dutch,</HI> others <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Loocker</HI> caus'd one of the Souldiers in his company that had a &s;trong voice, to call out in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, to the people to come and help them. But in&s;tead of that they all betook them&s;elves to their heels, and fled to the Commander's Lodge, telling him that there were Devils in the Woods, and that they had call'd to them in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language. The Commander feeing both the Souldiers and the Slaves in &s;uch a di&s;mal amaze and terror, knew not at fir&s;t what to think; however he endeavoured to re&s;ettle their di&s;traction, and to revive a &s;ort of people that were half dead with fear. The next day he per&s;uaded them to return to their Work, per&s;uading them to lay a&s;ide their vain Fears, which proceeded onely from idle Apprehen&s;i|ons: but they flatly denied him, telling him that they would rather die, than return to be torn in pieces by the Devil. However, others that had not been pre&s;ent at the accident, and therefore gave not &s;o much credit to the report, profer|ed to &s;ee the utmo&s;t of this bu&s;ine&s;s, provided any one that
<PB N="64" REF="463">
had heard the voice would bring them to the place. Away upon this went a good number of them together, and co|ming to the place fell to work. Now becau&s;e <HI>Loocker</HI> and his Companions having labour'd all the night before, were fallen a&s;leep; for a good while the Workmen heard no voice at all, nor &s;o much as any thing &s;tirring, &s;o that they began to laugh at tho&s;e that had brought them thither, who &s;till ob&s;tinately maintained the truth of what they had heard. This Di&s;pute at length began to grow &s;o hot and &s;o loud, that at length they wak'd <HI>Loocker</HI> and his Fellows, who be|ing now got nearer to them by means of their la&s;t nights la|bour, heard di&s;tinctly every word they &s;aid, and notwith|&s;tanding their di&s;tre&s;s could not chu&s;e but laugh. Soon af|ter <HI>Loocker</HI> and the Souldiers call'd out again, <HI>Work toward us,</HI> they cried, <HI>we are Hollanders, come and help us out of the Wood, and we will put an end to the di&s;pute.</HI> But the Workmen no &s;ooner heard them, but away they ran for their Lives, and when they came to the Lodge, they were &s;o har'd, &s;o &s;car'd, and quite out of breath, that the Governour in vain endeavour'd to get the lea&s;t tittle of a word from them. At length being come to them&s;elves, they a&s;&s;ur'd him that it was too true that the Devils were in the Wood, and that the more to deceive and wheedle them, to day they had not onely &s;poken <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but <HI>Dutch</HI> too. This put the Go|vernour and all into a deep Con&s;ternation, in&s;omuch that they were all at their Wits end. But the next morning <HI>Loocker</HI> and his Gang having made their way through, the Centinel &s;pied them fir&s;t from the Fort, and by the di&s;|charge of his Mu&s;quet gave notice of the approach of the Devils. And then it was that the poor affrighted Mortals, laying a&s;ide their fears, and going forth to meet their own Shapes, found them to be a company of their Countrymen in di&s;tre&s;s, whom they then received into their kindne&s;s, to give an account of their Misfortunes. Three days after the Ship came into Harbour, though in a mi&s;erable condition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Grandeur of the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> and what befell his Wife and his Niece.</HEAD>
<P>THe Company to maintain their Authority and Commerce in the <HI>Indies,</HI> believe it to be to their advantage, that the General whom they &s;end to <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> and who commands in all the places in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> traffic, &s;hould keep up the Port of a Prince. There is no Cavalry in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o well clad or mounted as his; the Hor&s;emen all upon <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Steeds. Nor is his Foot Guard le&s;s &s;umptuous: His Halberdiers wear their yellow Satten Doublets, Scarlet Breeches lac'd with Silver Lace, and their Silk Stockins. But this onely for the General's Guards; for tho&s;e which they &s;end abroad to their Forts and Garri&s;ons, it is a great pity to &s;ee how poorly they are attir'd, and how meanly fed. When the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet arrives at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the Souldiers which they bring are drawn up in the Parade of the Fortre&s;s by the Major, who chu&s;es out the hand&s;ome&s;t to remain at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the re&s;t are &s;ent and di&s;tributed into other places. When the Gene|ral and his Wife go abroad, they always ride in their Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es, with &s;ix Halberdiers attending at each Boot, and a Troop of Hor&s;e and two Companies of Foot for their Guard. The Authority of the General is very great, though he may be &s;ometimes commanded by his Wife: neither is it &s;afe for them that depend upon them, to do or &s;ay any thing that may offend them. But for others, who have their Im|ployments immediately from the Company, they never ob|lige them&s;elves to be &s;o circum&s;pect. For truth whereof I will relate the following plea&s;ant Story.</P>
<P>The Wife of General <HI>Mat&s;uker</HI> having one day underta|ken to play upon a Captain of a Ship call'd the <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and to laugh at him, for having lo&s;t a Bale of Goods which had been &s;eized by the Company, in regard no particular per&s;on is permitted to trade. The Captain nettled at her Di&s;cour&s;e, re&s;olved to be revenged. Nor was it long before he found
<PB N="66" REF="464">
the means; for being commanded away for <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Goleonda,</HI> where being arriv'd, laden, and ready to &s;et Sail to return to <HI>Batavia,</HI> the chief of the Factory de&s;ired him to take in four Bales of Goods for the General's Wife, as belonging to her, and to deliver them privately to her. This was Nuts to the Captain: &s;o that being return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> he went he went immediately to vi&s;it the Ge|neral, and deliver him the Letters which concerned the <HI>Car|go.</HI> Immediately according to cu&s;tom the General invited him to dinner, at which time it is u&s;ual for the General to inform him&s;elf of the Condition of the Factory. Among the re&s;t of the que&s;tions the General asked the Captain whe|ther he had any Counterband Goods aboard, or any that were not upon the Company's &s;ole account. To which the Captain an&s;wered, that all the Goods belonged to the Company, except four Bales, which the chief Factor at <HI>Mu&s;lipatan</HI> had particularly recommended to his care, as be|longing to Madam General. This being publickly &s;poken in the pre&s;ence of a great many that were at Table, the Lady that was not aware of &s;uch a blow, was not a little &s;urpriz'd, and the General him&s;elf was not a little in wrath, &s;ternly ask'd her how &s;he dur&s;t undertake to trade without his knowledge. Pre&s;ently &s;he denied the whole matter, and averted that the Captain was mi&s;taken, and took her for &s;ome other per&s;on. But the General &s;ent for the Pi&s;cal, and or|der'd him to go forthwith with the Captain, and fetch the four Bales a&s;hoa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; which being done, he order'd further that the Goods &s;hould be carried into the public Hall of the Town Hou&s;e, with a Writing fix'd upon them, that who|ever own'd tho&s;e Goods &s;hould come and claim them; but no body came. So that the Captain had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Lady in a delicate raging pa&s;&s;ion, and the Goods di&s;pos'd of to the Fi&s;cal, and the Poor of the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The &s;ame General and his Wife having no Children, they began to con&s;ider to whom they &s;hould leave their E&s;tates. At length the General bethought him&s;elf of a Niece he had at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and therefore wrote to the Directors of the Company to &s;end her to him. This Niece of his cried Pot|herbs and Onions about the &s;treet to get her living; in which Calling &s;he was at la&s;t found out, and brought to the Dire|ctors; who pre&s;ently changed her Habit, and of a Crier of
<PB N="67" REF="464">
Cabbage made her a little Lady; who though &s;he were of &s;uch a low condition, was not without a good proportion of natural Beauty.</P>
<P>The Fleet being ready to depart, there was a Cabin built on purpo&s;e for this Niece, and the Company having pre|&s;ented her with &s;everal pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue and Silks, recom|mended her to <HI>C. Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> the Viceadmiral's care. This Cap|tain had been &s;everal times at the <HI>Indies</HI> before, and was both rich and a Batchelour: &s;o that when the Ship was out at Sea, he fail'd not to &s;hew all the re&s;pects imaginable to this Niece. Now this young Virgin not being accu&s;tomed to the Sea, upon the lea&s;t gu&s;t of Wind &s;he was half dead; and all that time the Captain would not &s;tir from her Bed|&s;ide, for fear any Accident &s;hould befall her. And as he was thus diligent not to &s;tir from her Bed-&s;ide in fowl, 'tis verily believ'd he was &s;eldom far from it in fair weather; and that in&s;tead of &s;itting by her Bed-&s;ide, he &s;ometimes got fairly into it. But whether he were within or without, mo&s;t certain it is, that before Madam Niece arrived at <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> &s;he found her &s;elf to be with child, though &s;he &s;o di&s;creetly concealed it, that none in the Ve&s;&s;el percei|ved it.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el had no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed the Strait that lies to|ward <HI>Bantam,</HI> but Madam General with a great number of her Friends in &s;everal little Barques came out to meet Ma|dam Niece, and were not a little &s;urprized to find her to be a per&s;on &s;o well clad and hand&s;om withall, without any appearance of what &s;he had been before.</P>
<P>A Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es, and &s;ix Halberdiers, a Troop of Hor&s;e, and a Company of Foot, waited upon the &s;hoar for Madam General. And thus was Madam Niece conduct|ed to the Fort with great pomp, and as kindly received by Mon&s;ieur General. Some few days after &s;everal of the Gal|lants of <HI>Batavia</HI> came picquiering to the Hou&s;e to &s;ee Ma|dam Niece; and &s;o it was, that all being &s;mitten, every one de&s;ired her in Marriage: but both Uncle and Aunt were deaf to all their Suits, as having de&s;ign'd her to a young rich Merchant, who was then out of the way. <HI>C. Ro&s;&s;e</HI> laugh'd in his &s;leeve at the bu&s;tle that was made, and &s;till continued his former re&s;pects and double Diligences, which were the more willingly permitted him in regard of the great care of
<PB N="68" REF="465">
their Niece, for which the Uncle and the Aunt thought them&s;elves oblig'd to him during their Voyage. But at length &s;eeing &s;uch a &s;warm of Sweethearts about her, he thought it but charity to undeceive &s;o many poor Gulls, and without further ceremony to go to her Aunt, and to demand her Niece for his Wife. The She General who look'd up|on her&s;elf to be a kind of a Queen at <HI>Batavia,</HI> look'd upon it as a high offence and indignity for a Tarpaulin Captain of a Ship to dare to make her &s;uch a Propo&s;al, having alrea|dy refus'd &s;uch Matches, per&s;ons that might come to be Privy Coun&s;ellors of all the <HI>Indies.</HI> Neverthele&s;s within a day or two after the Captain renewed his Charge, but then in a Maje&s;tic Fury &s;he utterly forbid him the Fort. He ta|king little notice of her rage, goes to the General, and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e makes the &s;ame Propo&s;al, and receives the &s;ame An&s;wer. But then the Captain gave the Husband &s;uch a Bone to pick, that he would not give the Wife; Sir, &s;aid he, twice already have I demanded your Niece in Mar|riage, this is now the third time that I make the &s;ame de|mand; if you refu&s;e me, you &s;hall ask me four times before I accept of her: and &s;o &s;aying briskly left him. The Gene|ral reflecting upon the Captain's words, went to his Wife and told her the Story, who gue&s;&s;ing at the effects of a long Voyage Familiarity, call'd Madam Niece into examination: She not being us'd to Di&s;&s;imulation confe&s;s'd the whole mat|ter, and without any more to do was married to the Cap|tain, to the great wonder of the whole City, till the birth of a Boy at the end of &s;ix moneths unfolded the Riddle. But this lying in was her ruin; for about five or &s;ix days after, the Mother and the Nur&s;e being ill, the chief Chirurgeon of the Fort order'd them to take a little <HI>Cremor Tartar;</HI> and to that purpo&s;e &s;ent a young man to the Ma&s;ter Chirurgeon of the Town, to &s;end him two quantities of <HI>Cremor Tartar</HI> in two Papers. He being drinking with his Friends, &s;ends a young Barber newly come from <HI>Holland,</HI> to put up the two quantities according to direction. But the Barber mi&s;took the Gla&s;s, and put up <HI>Sublimate</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Cremor Tartar.</HI> So the two Women taking their Do&s;es, di&s;&s;olved in two Silver Cups of fair Water, died in 24 hours after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of General <HI>Vanderbroug,</HI> and of the Original of the City of <HI>Batavia</HI></HEAD>
<P>GEneral <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> was of <HI>Anver&s;e,</HI> and having &s;tu|died in the Je&s;uits College, retained &s;ome tincture of Learning, which he endeavoured to improve as much as his bu&s;ine&s;s would give him leave. While he was General he caus'd the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be tran&s;lated out of <HI>Arabic</HI> into <HI>Dutch.</HI> He was al&s;o a man of courage, and &s;e|veral times expos'd him&s;elf to great hazards for the Service of the Company, as you &s;hall &s;ee by the following Re|lation.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had taken &s;everal Prizes from the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> by Sea, they wanted a place of Retreat, where they might repair their endamaged Ships, and repo&s;e after the toils of the Sea. At fir&s;t they ca&s;t their eyes upon the I&s;land of <HI>Java,</HI> in that place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had built a &s;mall Convenience for their Trade. There is a Road in that part, where Ve&s;&s;els ride &s;ecurely all the year, into which a River di&s;charges it &s;elf that will receive Shallops of good burthen, for above a thou&s;and Paces. The Water of this River is mo&s;t excellent; for being carried never &s;o far to Sea, it never &s;tinks, nor engenders Worms; which can only be &s;aid of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> therefore came and lay upon the point of a River, over again&s;t the place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had their &s;mall Hou&s;e. They had with them then the greate&s;t part of the Ships which they had in the <HI>Indies,</HI> laden with tho&s;e great Bales of Cloth which come from <HI>Bengale</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Surat,</HI> &s;o big that a dozen men can hardly manage them. The&s;e Bales they landed, and of them made a kind of Forti|fication, planting a good number of great Guns between them: For they never wanted great Guns ever &s;ince they traded alone to <HI>Japon,</HI> the onely Kingdom of the World abounding in Copper; from whence they brought prodigi|ous quantities to <HI>Macao</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> where they ca&s;t their Artil|lery.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="466">
Thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thought that by Sea no body could endamage their &s;mall Fortification, made of Bales of cloth, which was defended by their Ve&s;&s;els which they had in the Road: But by Land they were afraid that the King of the I&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> either of <HI>Materan</HI> or <HI>Bantam,</HI> might di|&s;turb them. Ob&s;erving therefore the Situation of the I&s;land, which on that &s;ide was all covered with Woods, which reached on that &s;ide within a League of the Sea; and that where they ended, to the Shoar there was no other way but a Bank, which &s;eparated the Mar&s;h from the River: So that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> the better to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the two Kings, re&s;olved to rai&s;e a Tower upon the Bank. In this Tower they planted &s;everal Culverins and &s;mall Pieces, cramm'd with artificial Wild<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, and every evening relieved their Guards. The King of <HI>Materan</HI> perceiving this, and believing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not &s;top here, advanced a powerful Army to pull down the Tower. To which purpo&s;e he brought with him great Chains of Iron, and Cables made of the <HI>Coco</HI> Flax; believing that by the favour of the Night, having got his Chains and Ropes about the Tower, by the &s;trength of his Men and Elephants he might ea&s;ily pull it down. But having fail'd in his Enterprize, and for that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Artillery kill'd him abundance of Men, he retreated with his Army. But it was not long be|fore he return'd again with a more powerful Force by Land, and al&s;o a great Fleet of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els to a&s;&s;i&s;t him by Sea. With the&s;e Forces he gave a furious On&s;et a &s;econd time, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with no le&s;s vigour &s;u&s;tained, and beat him off. But nothing di&s;couraged with his lo&s;s, he re&s;olved to give a third On&s;et, onely he &s;taid &s;ome few days in expe|ctation of more Forces.</P>
<P>In the mean while one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Captains of his Army was accus'd to the King not to have done his Duty: though &s;ea&s;onably advertiz'd that the King was re|&s;olv'd to &s;eize upon his per&s;on, and cut him to pieces. For you mu&s;t know, that among the <HI>Javans</HI> when any per&s;on has merited Death, they tie the Offender all along upon a great piece of Timber, and the next Lord or great per&s;on that has a mind to try the goodne&s;s of his Scimitar, comes and cuts the Body into four pieces, the fir&s;t &s;troak being made upon the Bre&s;t, the &s;econd upon the Pit of the Stomach, the
<PB N="71" REF="466">
third upon the lower part of the Belly. The four pieces if they be Men, are burnt; if Women, thrown to the Dogs, which they keep for that purpo&s;e. For the <HI>Javans</HI> never burn any per&s;on.</P>
<P>This <HI>Javane&s;e</HI> Lord therefore knowing what he was to tru&s;t to, made his e&s;cape to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and was kindly received by <HI>Vanderbroug.</HI> To ingratiate him&s;elf, he told the <HI>Dutch</HI> General all the King's De&s;igns in reference to the carrying the place; where he would make his On&s;et, and what number of men he had. This however did not &s;uffi|ciently chear up the General, who knew his own weakne&s;s. So that the <HI>Javane&s;e</HI> perceiving him &s;till pen&s;ive, I find (&s;aid he) that thou art afraid of the King's &s;trength, and rea&s;on thou ha&s;t, but be rul'd by me: Thou art not ignorant that the <HI>Javanners</HI> are rigid Ob&s;ervers of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and that if any Uncleanne&s;s from a Chri&s;tian hand falls upon their Clothes, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ing them away, and &s;pend &s;ix whole days in wa&s;hing them&s;elves, before they believe them&s;elves clean. Hear then, &s;aid he; let all the Ordure and Dung of the People that are with thee be heaped in a place together, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Pots for that purpo&s;e; and when they mount their Ladders, &s;pare not for Showres of that Liquor, and I warrant ye they will retreat fa&s;ter than they came on. Farther continued he; I know that the points of their Ar|rows and <HI>Cric's</HI> are poi&s;on'd, and that this poi&s;on is &s;o &s;trong, that whoever are wounded therewith die &s;uddenly, unle&s;s they have recour&s;e to this onely Remedy; which is to pre&s;erve their own Excrement, and to dry it to powder; and when they find them&s;elves wounded, to take a little of the powder, and drink it off in a &s;mall Beer-gla&s;s of Water. The General ob&s;erving what the <HI>Javan</HI> Lord had &s;aid, when the Enemy mounted their Ladders, lu&s;tily be&s;mear'd them with the Liquor, which he caus'd to be prepar'd again&s;t their coming; &s;o that in&s;tead of gaining the tops of their Ladders, they made all the ha&s;te they could down again; but being hindred by tho&s;e that follow'd them, they threw them&s;elves headlong to the ground; by which means &s;everal of them were maimed, and &s;everal kill'd outright. Thus the Army disbanded in a moment, and the Emperour was the fir&s;t that took his flight. <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> ob&s;erving the di&s;orderly Re|treat of the Enemy, took a &s;mall Party with him, and pur|&s;u'd
<PB N="72" REF="467">
the flying Enemy, who being enclo&s;ed by tho&s;e in the Fort, that &s;ally'd out upon them, were mi&s;erably cut in pie|ces. But the General having left the greate&s;t part of his men, and returning onely with a &s;mall and very incon&s;ider|able Company, the <HI>Javanners</HI> who had hid them&s;elves in the Mer&s;hes for fear, re&s;um'd courage, and &s;uddenly fell up|on him in his return, and &s;o encompa&s;s'd him on every &s;ide, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape. However they de|fended them&s;elves &s;toutly for a while, but being wounded with the Arrows and <HI>Cric's</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and not being provided of the forementioned Antidote, they died imme|diately. The General was taken alive, not &s;o much as wounded; for as he told me afterwards him&s;elf, he found they had no de&s;ire to kill him. So &s;oon as he was taken they carried him to the Emperour, who as &s;oon as he &s;aw him bid him not fear any thing, but told him withall, that it was his plea&s;ure, that he &s;hould command his Men to quit the Fort and Tower, and be gone; otherwi&s;e that he would make both him, and all tho&s;e that &s;hould fall into his Hands, perpetual Slaves. At the &s;ame time the Empe|rour with his principal Officers, and the General with a good Guard, came to the Foot of the Wall of the Tower, where the General in the <HI>Malay</HI> Language, laying before them his own misfortune, and the improbability of their holding out long, commanded them to quit the Fort, after they had embarqued whatever they &s;aw fitting, but onely 6 Pieces of &s;mall Canon, 200 Bullets, and 500 Quintals of Powder. The Emperour was overjoy'd to hear what the General &s;aid, and thought him&s;elf &s;ure of the Fort and Tower. But then the General turning to the Emperour, told him, that none of his men under&s;tood <HI>Malay,</HI> and that therefore it would be convenient for him to repeat the &s;ame in <HI>Flemi&s;h.</HI> Which being granted, he &s;poke to the Souldiers in <HI>Flemi&s;h,</HI> and ordered them quite the contrary; that is to &s;ay, that they &s;hould not be Traitors to their Countrey, but hold out the place till death, not minding what became of him; and to that end, that they &s;hould bid the Infidels forthwith re|tire, or el&s;e they would immediately fire all their Guns up|on them. The Emperour a&s;toni&s;h'd at their Re&s;olution re|treats, and carries the General with him. Being thus re|tir'd, the General made him believe that he would find a
<PB N="73" REF="467">
means to write to the Company, to give them an account of what had pa&s;s'd, and that he was confident they would give &s;uch order for an Accommodation, as &s;hould &s;atisfie His Maje&s;ty, which &s;atisfi'd the Emperour for that time. In the mean while the General found an opportunity to get into a &s;mall Barque, and to get to the Fort, where he was joy|fully receiv'd. This Recital I had from his own mouth.</P>
<P>The General having done this and &s;everal other eminent Services for the Company, and acquitted him&s;elf with Re|putation and a fair E&s;tate, was de&s;irous to return home, where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and &s;everal of the States had no le&s;s a de&s;ire to &s;ee him.

<P>One day the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> asking him what Rarities he had brought out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> he call'd for five Silver Plates, and &s;etting them upon the Table, drew out five little Bags out of his Pocket, and emptied a &s;everal Bag up|on a &s;everal Plate; which &s;urpriz'd not onely the Prince, but &s;everal others of the States then pre&s;ent, to &s;ee &s;uch a number of Diamonds and other Jewels of a va&s;t value.</P>
<P>It was not without &s;ome difficulty that he was again en|tertain'd by the Company; but at length they &s;ent him Ad|miral of two Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where being arriv'd, the Ge|neral and Con&s;uls made him Admiral of the Fleet that was ju&s;t bound for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel, Surat,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Country about <HI>Cochin,</HI> and how the <HI>Holland</HI> General crown'd one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Countrey about <HI>Cochin</HI> is planted for the mo&s;t part with that &s;ort of Tree which they call <HI>Cocos,</HI> the Fruit whereof produces that &s;ort of Wine which the Inhabitants call <HI>Tary,</HI> whereof they make their Strong Water. They mingle this Wine with cour&s;e black Sugar unrefin'd, together with the Bark of a Tree which bears nothing but Thorns. This Bark cau&s;es the <HI>Tary</HI> and Sugar to boil and ferment like new Wine. When the <HI>Tary</HI> and the Sugar have fermented for above &s;even or eight hours, they di&s;till them in an Alembic, and make Strong Water, which is &s;tronger or &s;maller, by how much the more often or &s;eldomer it is di&s;till'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Coverture of the&s;e Trees the whole Country is full of Cows; for they are all Idolaters in this Country, that onely wor&s;hip their Cows for their Gods, feed upon their Milk, and eat nothing that has Life.</P>
<P>When you leave the Countries of the&s;e Princes, which they call <HI>Rajas,</HI> travelling toward the North Ea&s;t you enter into the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velouche,</HI> which are of a large extent. He and all his Subjects being Idolaters, un|le&s;s it be about nine or ten thou&s;and poor People call'd <HI>Chri|&s;tians of S. John,</HI> as being baptiz'd after the &s;ame manner that S. <HI>John</HI> baptiz'd the People in the Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After the taking of <HI>Cochin,</HI> of which we have given a full Relation in our <HI>Indian</HI> Travels, General <HI>Vangous,</HI> who com|manded at the Siege, became &s;o haughty that he de&s;pis'd all the other Officers, as well Military as tho&s;e that belonged to the Government and Ju&s;tice of the City. However to recompence one of the <HI>Raja's</HI> by who&s;e means he had ta|ken the City, he per&s;uaded him to quit the Name of <HI>Raja,</HI> and to a&s;&s;ume the Title of <HI>King,</HI> that he might have the Honour to &s;et the Crown upon his Head. To this end he made great inquiry through his whole Army for a Gold|&s;mith,
<PB N="75" REF="468">
and having found out one that undertook it, and caus'd him to make a Crown of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, that weigh'd near ten Marks, which I believe the <HI>Raja</HI> found more in|convenient and weighty upon his Head, than an old Muc|kender with three corners bound about his Head, which is the mark of the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Sovereignty.</P>
<P>While they were making this Crown there were great preparations for the Ceremony: It was performed in a Gar|den near the Town, where was &s;et a large Tent &s;pread all over with painted Calicut. Within was a Throne erected with a Canopy of <HI>China</HI> Damask, and all the Steps to the Throne were cover'd with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tapi&s;try.</P>
<P>The day being come, the greate&s;t part of the Army, Offi|cers and Souldiers, went to fetch the <HI>Raja,</HI> who lay in his Hut a quarter of a League off; where they mounted him upon one of two Elephants which the General &s;ent him, be|ing attended likewi&s;e with two led Hor&s;es, and two <HI>Palan|quins</HI> for more State. Being come to the place, he was clad in a Scarlet Robe with great Hanging Sleeves, and &s;o brought in where <HI>Vangous</HI> was &s;itting upon his Throne, with a Sword and a Crown by him. The <HI>Raja</HI> being come to the Foot of the Throne, the Major of the Army took the Sword, deliver'd him by the General, and girt the <HI>Raja,</HI> who then a&s;cending the Steps of the Throne, pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore the <HI>Holland</HI> General while he put the Crown upon his Head. Then the new King ri&s;eth up, and lays his Hand upon the Head of a Cow that &s;tood near the Throne. Which done, kneeling with his Hands cla&s;p'd, and lifted toward the Head of the &s;ame Cow, he took his Oath to be true and faithful to the Company, and to embrace their Intere&s;ts. On the other &s;ide the General promis'd him on the behalf of the Company, that they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him when he &s;hould have occa&s;ion again&s;t his Enemies. Which Solemnities be|ing very gravely perform'd the Mu&s;quettiers gave three Volleys, and the new King was conducted back to his Hut with the &s;ame Pomp that he was brought. Thus you &s;ee the Pride of a Pepper Merchant, to make Kings and domineer over Crowns.</P>
<P>One other famous Act of <HI>Vangous</HI> mu&s;t not be forgotten. You mu&s;t know, that at the taking of <HI>Cochin</HI> the Je&s;uits had in that City one of the faire&s;t Libraries in all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as well
<PB N="76" REF="469">
for the great quantity of Books &s;ent them out of <HI>Europe,</HI> as for &s;everal rare Manu&s;cripts in the <HI>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, Per&s;ian, Indian, Chine&s;e,</HI> and other Oriental Languages. For in all the Conque&s;ts of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> their fir&s;t care was to &s;ummon all the Learned People of the &s;everal Nations, and to get all their Books into their hands. During that little time which the Je&s;uits &s;taid in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> they had copied out all the good Books that came to their knowledge, and &s;ent all tho&s;e Books to <HI>Cochin.</HI> They had &s;taid longer in <HI>Aethio|pia,</HI> had it not been for the Jealou&s;ie of the Patriarchs, and their Bi&s;hops, which are very numerous; &s;o that if there be two men in one Village that belong to one Church, the chief|e&s;t calls him&s;elf Bi&s;hop. At their Ceremonies of Bapti&s;m when they name the Holy Gho&s;t, they apply a hot Iron to the neck of the Infant, &s;aying that the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended upon the Apo&s;tles in the &s;hape of Fiery Tongues. The Pa|triarchs and Bi&s;hops were jealous of the Je&s;uits, finding that they had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the favour of the King and Grandees of the Court. Which &s;o enraged the <HI>Aethiopi|ans,</HI> that they caus'd the People to mutiny, preaching that the King was about to alter the Religion of the Country, and to draw along with him &s;everal of the Lords. And the Fury of the People grew to that height, that whatever the King could do or &s;ay, he could not appea&s;e their Fury: So that they put him in pri&s;on, and elected his Brother in his place. The cau&s;e of this di&s;order was laid upon the Je&s;uits, and was the rea&s;on that they were expell'd the Kingdom; neither had they &s;cap'd &s;o, but they were afraid of the Governour of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and the <HI>Portugals</HI> that inhabit all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> But to tell ye what became of this Library, General <HI>Vangous</HI> made no con&s;cience to expo&s;e it to the ignorance of his Souldiers, &s;o that I have &s;een the Souldiers and Seamen tear &s;everal of tho&s;e beautiful Volums to light their Tobacco.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sieur <HI>Hollebrand Glins,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Factory at <HI>Ormus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VVHen the Ships come to <HI>Ormus,</HI> it is a great pre|judice for the Goods to lie out of doors. For &s;uch is the extremity of the Heat in that part, that if the Spices, e&s;pecially the Cloves, be not carried to the Water-&s;ide every foot, and there laid to &s;teep in the Water for four and twenty hours, they would turn to a mere powder.</P>
<P>Sugar is brought thither in great Wooden Che&s;ts, but if there be the lea&s;t Cleft for a Fly or an Emmet to get in, in a &s;mall time the Che&s;t will be half emptied.</P>
<P>As for Camphire, which is brought from <HI>Borneo</HI> in Pipes, if it lie a little too long in that warm Air, it will exhale above half away.</P>
<P>To remedy the&s;e Inconveniences <HI>Sieur Hollebrand</HI> re&s;ol|ved to build a bigger Warehou&s;e. Among the re&s;t of the Workmen that were imployed in this Building was a Gun|&s;mith, who came in the <HI>interim</HI> in a Ship from <HI>Batavia.</HI> This poor Fellow was imployed to make Locks for the Warehou&s;e; for in tho&s;e Parts they have no other Keys, or Locks either, than what are made of Wood: So that it was a Crime for him to be found idle at any time. And there|fore the Pre&s;ident finding him one Sunday in the Afternoon drinking with two of his Companions that came from the Ship to &s;ee him, gave the Fellow half a dozen good Licks with his Cane, and would have given him more, but that the Smith being a &s;turdy Fellow, and feeling the Blows &s;mart, wre&s;ted the Stick out of the Pre&s;ident's Hands, and flung it out of the Window. For which the Pre&s;ident, upon pre|tence that the Fellow had &s;truck him four Blows, which was untrue, as I my &s;elf being there could witne&s;s, &s;ent him la|den with Chains to the Ship, where he would have tried him for his Life, in a full Court of the Merchants of the Fa|ctory: but they refu&s;ing him, for very madne&s;s he took
<PB N="78" REF="470">
two Notaries, that he had a power over, went to the Ship alone, made the Officers of the Ship, and condemn'd the Fellow to be hang'd. And he had certainly been executed but for me and &s;ome other of my Countrymen, (for the Fel|low was of <HI>Geneva)</HI> that threatned the Pre&s;ident out of his de&s;ign. Yet he caus'd him to be drubb'd Naked at the Main Ma&s;t after that inhuman manner, that he lo&s;t the u&s;e of one of his Arms. This the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> could never forget, and therefore &s;ought all opportunities to kill him; to which purpo&s;e he put him&s;elf in the &s;ame Ship with <HI>Hollebrand</HI> when he returned for <HI>Holland.</HI> But coming to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and being &s;ent a&s;hoar in the Shallop for Provi&s;i|ons, the Shallop was over&s;et in a &s;tormy Sea, and <HI>Hollebrand</HI>'s Life thereby &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>But before we leave <HI>Ormus,</HI> where <HI>Hollebrand</HI> was build|ing his Warehou&s;e that caus'd all this mi&s;chief, let us take notice of this by the way, that there is no abiding at <HI>Ormus</HI> till <HI>April,</HI> le&s;t you pay for your &s;tay with &s;ome Malignant Fever, that may hold a man as long as he lives; or if he be cur'd by chance, yet will the White of his Eyes be more yel|low than Saffron. This &s;ame &s;ort of Fever &s;eizes our <HI>Euro|peans</HI> in the Port of <HI>Alexandretta</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and in the I&s;lands where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lade their Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace.</P>

<P>THE Fort of <HI>Batavia</HI> has four fair Ba&s;tions, and is well built but upon an ill Foundation, tho&s;e Ba&s;tions being plainly ob&s;erv'd to &s;ink, and requiring Repa|ration from time to time. For the perfecting of which Work the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wanted Slaves: whereupon a Con&s;ultation was had where to get Slaves. To which An&s;wer was made, that there was no better place than the Prince's I&s;lands. Which being concluded, the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> di&s;patch'd away three the bigge&s;t Ships belonging to <HI>Batavia.</HI> The&s;e Ships vi&s;ited every one of the&s;e I&s;lands, feigning that they came from <HI>Holland</HI> and wanted Refre&s;hment. So &s;oon as the Inhabitants di&s;cover'd the Ve&s;&s;els, they flock'd to the Shoar Men, Women, and Children, as they wont to do, bringing along with them the be&s;t of their Provi&s;ion, as <HI>Coco</HI> Wine, Nuts, and other Fruits of the growth of the I&s;lands.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;ent to declare War against the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and of the ill Succe&s;s of their Fleet.</HEAD>
<P>MUch about the &s;ame time <HI>Charles Con&s;tant</HI> was &s;ent by the Company with a Fleet of &s;even great Ships, to declare War again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> in ca&s;e they would not comply with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in reference to their Silk Trade and their Cu&s;toms. Being arriv'd at <HI>Ormus</HI> he left the Fleet there, and ha&s;ten'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Casbin,</HI> where then the King was. But his Emba&s;&s;ie had not that effect as he expected: For he thought that the King would have been frighted at the noi&s;e of a Fleet of &s;even great Ships that lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> but he was mi&s;taken. For the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> knew he need not &s;end any Force again&s;t the &s;aid Fleet, in regard it would be ruin'd without: It being impo&s;&s;ible for our <HI>Europeans</HI> to &s;tay at <HI>Ormus</HI> in the heat of Somer, as well by rea&s;on of the Heat, as for want of Water; for there is no good Water at <HI>Ormus,</HI> nor upon any part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but what is kept in Ci&s;terns, and that full of Worms. 'Tis true, that upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia</HI> there are Wells of good Water, but when the <HI>Arabians</HI> di&s;|cover any Ships upon the Coa&s;t, they come down all in Arms to defend their Wells; for it is their profit to &s;ell their Water, and that at a very dear rate, to tho&s;e that are in ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now the King and Council not being ignorant, that the longer the Fleet lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> the wor&s;e would be its con|dition, would not give the Commander his fir&s;t Audience in two moneths. During which time there died above half the Men; for from &s;ix a clock in the morning till four in the afternoon, if any of the Seamen went to take a little Air upon the Deck, he pre&s;ently fell down dead. The Admi|ral was to blame not to make provi&s;ion of Water being bound for &s;uch a place as <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Commander <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> did not take the right cour&s;e to effect his bu&s;ine&s;s, by publi&s;hing what he intended to pre|&s;ent
<PB N="81" REF="471">
the Mini&s;ters of State withall. For the Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> never take any Pre&s;ents them&s;elves, for fear it &s;hould come to the King's Ear. But there is a private Bill &s;ent to the Party for whom it is intended, and he &s;ends whom he thinks fit to receive it. Had he &s;o done, and doubled his Sum of 5000 <HI>Venetian</HI> Ducats, perhaps the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> might have us'd him more kindly, e&s;pecially for &s;o long time as that King had. For whatever a Predece&s;&s;or does, a Succe&s;&s;or changes many things. So that if the decea&s;ed King have given any Hou&s;e or Land to any per&s;on, it mu&s;t be confirm|ed by the &s;ucceeding King in his fir&s;t Year, or el&s;e the Gift returns to the King. It is the &s;ame thing if any per&s;on builds a Hou&s;e upon the King's Deme&s;ns: which has been a great inconvenience to the <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> Friers and bare-foot <HI>Carmelites,</HI> becau&s;e their Hou&s;es are built upon the Lands which <HI>Cha Abbas</HI> gave them of the Royal Deme&s;ns. So that every time a new King a&s;cends the Throne, they are forc'd to make the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> new Pre&s;ents, &s;ometimes to the Value of the Land: for it is a rare thing to find a prime Mini&s;ter that is a Friend to the Chri&s;tians. But the Je&s;uits and Capuchins, who came after them, provided better for them&s;elves, each of tho&s;e Orders having bought the Ground upon which their Hou&s;es are built.</P>
<P>The Commander &s;eeing that he could not compa&s;s his De&s;ign, and that the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> would abate nothing of the forty four <HI>Tomans</HI> which he demanded, went to the <HI>Divanbegai</HI> and told him, that buying the &s;ame Goods of particular per&s;ons, they might be had for thirty two, or at mo&s;t for thirty three <HI>Tomans.</HI> To which the <HI>Divanbegai</HI> an|&s;wered him, That all tho&s;e particular per&s;ons paid the King Cu&s;tom, and Convoy upon the Road, the Cu&s;tom alone amounting to Eighteen <HI>per cent.</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not pay: and that there was not a Year wherein they did not bring in Goods to the Value of 30000 <HI>Tomans;</HI> and that if account &s;hould be taken of the Silks which they carried away, and of the Goods which they brought in, the <HI>Athema|doulet</HI> ought to make them pay near 50000 <HI>Tomans</HI> for Du|ties. The Commander ill &s;atisfied with this An&s;wer went to his Lodging, and without asking the Advice of the Mer|chants that were with him, or of his <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who better under&s;tood the Practice of the Court, or without taking his
<PB N="82" REF="472">
leave of the King, return'd privately to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> intending for <HI>Bander</HI> where the Fleet lay. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> being advertiz'd of his &s;udden departure, was very much offend|ed; &s;o much the more becau&s;e at the Commanders fir&s;t Ar|rival he had done him great Civilities, even to the furni&s;h|ing his Lodgings after the <HI>European</HI> manner, with a Bed, Stools, and Tables. Thereupon he gave notice thereof to the King, who when he heard of it utter'd the&s;e words, <HI>Has any one given him any di&s;ta&s;te, or is he turn'd Fool? He &s;hall be glad to come back again.</HI></P>
<P>Being come to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to the great wonder of the <HI>Franks,</HI> who heard nothing of his taking leave of the King, he be|gan to make up his Pack, intending for <HI>Gomrom,</HI> in ca&s;e the King did not &s;end for him again; which he did, 'tis true, but not with tho&s;e Compliments which he expected; for he flatter'd him&s;elf that the King would have petition'd him to return. The King &s;ent for him indeed, but his Compliment was not very plea&s;ing; for the per&s;on that brought the Me&s;&s;age told him, That it was the King's plea&s;ure he &s;hould &s;peedily return, and if he would not go willingly he had order to carry him by force. But notwith&s;tanding the King's Command and the Coun&s;el of his Friends, he &s;et out from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> for <HI>Bander,</HI> according to his fir&s;t intent. We accom|panied him &s;ome part of his way, and being ju&s;t ready to take our leaves, we &s;aw a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gentile and well mount|ed, (he was a Captain of an hundred men) who calling the Interpreter to him, Go (&s;aid he) and tell thy Pre&s;ident, that he mu&s;t return to his Lodging, and to morrow make ha&s;te to the King, according to the Order he has already recei|ved: and with that he rode away full &s;peed. The Inter|preter told the Commander what the Captain &s;aid; but not|with&s;tanding all this the Commander being a per&s;on of a hot and ob&s;tinate humour, continued his way. Neither the Merchants of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> nor any of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI> Servants would follow him, fearing the Ba&s;tinado, and be|lieving he was &s;ecure enough; as it happen'd: for he had not rode far, before three Captains with their Bows and Ar|rows in their hands bolted out upon him, one of which ri|ding up directly to the Commander, Art thou (&s;aid he) the onely per&s;on that ever &s;et foot in this Empire, that refu&s;e&s;t to obey the Companion of the Sun, whom &s;o great a part

of the World obeys? At the &s;ame time came up fifty &s;tout Hor&s;emen, and one of them who cammanded them made at Mr. <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> with his Mace. Then the Admiral was forc'd to lower his Sails and return back, forc'd to receive an Affront which he might have avoided When he was come to his Lodging, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Officer without alighting call'd the Interpreter, and bid him go forwarn the Commander in the Name of the King, that neither he nor any of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> pre&s;umed to &s;tir out of their Hou&s;es till further order; for that if any of them were &s;een abroad, they &s;hould be taught to obey the King's Commands. Thus the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> having been coop'd up nine days, word was brought the Commander he might return to <HI>Cusbin,</HI> where he found that all his <HI>Rodomontado's</HI> &s;ignified nothing, but that he mu&s;t comply with the <HI>Athemadoulet.</HI></P>

But &s;o &s;oon as the Lady had revealed the My&s;tery, he was &s;o far from an&s;wering their expectation, that he threw the young Man laden with Fetters into pri&s;on, and &s;hut up the young Woman clo&s;e Pri&s;oner in her Chamber. Next day he call'd a Council, declar'd to them the Matter of Fact, and gave his Opinion, that the young man de&s;erv'd to lo&s;e his Head, and that the Maid &s;hould be whipp'd. The Council were of a contrary Judgment, and advis'd him to reconcile the Mi&s;chance by a Marriage. But notwith&s;tanding all their per&s;ua&s;ions the General re&s;olv'd to have his own humour, the next day pri|vately &s;ent for the Executioner, and cau&s;ing the young Man and the Maid to be brought into his Hall, commanded the Man's Head to be forthwith &s;truck off, and the Virgin to be whipp'd though big with Child.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Touching the Women.</HEAD>
<P>OFttimes when Women think that their Amours are mo&s;t &s;ecret, they are by &s;ome &s;trange and unexpect|ed accident odly di&s;cover'd. While I was at <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> the Secretary of the Ho&s;pital, as hand&s;om a per&s;on as any was in the City, had a Wife that pa&s;s'd for a <HI>Batavian</HI> Beauty, neither indeed was &s;he de&s;picable. This Couple had been &s;even years married without any Children; &s;o that the Woman de&s;pairing of her Husband's Abilities, and to know where the fault lay, re&s;olved to be&s;tow her Fa|vours upon one of her Slaves, who was well &s;hap'd but ve|ry black; chu&s;ing rather a private Familiarity with him, than with any young <HI>Hollander,</HI> who&s;e frequent Vi&s;its might breed &s;u&s;picion. It &s;eems the fault did not lie in her, for her Sable Gallant had &s;o improv'd his Talent, that in a &s;hort time &s;he found the effects of Change. In &s;hort, the Wo|mans Belly &s;well'd, and her Husband thinking his time had been come, began to boa&s;t of his Manhood, and great Joy there was among the Friends of the Woman upon the hopes of I&s;&s;ue. Great Provi&s;ions were made again&s;t the Lying in, and the General him&s;elf made choice of for Godfather. But when the good hour was come, and the Woman delivered, their Joy was turned into Mourning, for the Child prov'd one of the &s;ooty Of-&s;pring of the Sun-burnt race, a perfect Black. The Husband and Mother of the Woman blu&s;h'd as red for &s;hame as the Child was black, and the Go&s;&s;ips hung down their heads like Bulru&s;hes: nay the Husband was &s;o tran&s;ported with fury, that he could not hide his re&s;olution to murder his Wife, for bringing &s;uch a piece of live Char|cole into the world. But he was prevented, and &s;ecur'd in the Fort by the General, till by the intermi&s;&s;ion of Friends, who wi&s;ely laid before him the original cau&s;e of his Wifes
<PB N="86" REF="474">
Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they were at length made Friends, and the Slave for having &s;hew'd him&s;elf a Man, was condemn'd to tug at the Oars in the Galleys that go to fetch Stone for the u&s;e of the City.</P>
<P>Now as a White Woman may bring forth a Black, &s;o &s;ometimes a Black may be deliver'd of as White Child. For at <HI>Ba&ccedil;aim</HI> a <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Wife, as black as him&s;elf, was deli|ver'd of a white Child. The <HI>Cafer</HI> &s;eeing his Child white, would have immediately fallen upon his Wife and &s;trangled her, had not the good women that a&s;&s;i&s;ted at her Labour prevented him, and one of tho&s;e Go&s;&s;ips was &s;o cunning as to run to the Je&s;uits Hou&s;e, who are well re&s;pected by tho&s;e Blacks, to de&s;ire Father <HI>Thomas de Bare,</HI> who had a long time been Rector at <HI>Agra,</HI> to come to the <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Hou&s;e. Pre&s;ently the Father came with another of the Fraternity, and finding the <HI>Cafer</HI> &s;tamping and &s;taring almo&s;t out of his wits, and in open ho&s;tility without all rea&s;on, to ap|pea&s;e his fury ask'd him whether he kept any Hens, and whether he had any that were black. The <HI>Cafer</HI> an&s;wer'd that he did keep Hens, and that he had likewi&s;e black Hens. Pre&s;ently the Father order'd one to be brought him; and then holding it in both his hands before the good Women, Does this Hen (&s;aid he to the <HI>Cafer)</HI> lay thee any Eggs? Yes, replied the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Of what colour are they, &s;aid the Father? White, an&s;wer'd the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Well then, &s;aid the Father, thou art wor&s;e than thy &s;illy Creature, and ha&s;t far le&s;s rea&s;on; for if this Hen which is black lay thee white Eggs, why may not thy Wife which is black bring thee a white Child? This Compari&s;on &s;o wrought upon the <HI>Cafer,</HI> who was no Di&s;putant, that he embrac'd his Wife, ki&s;s'd his Child, and all was well again. Though for all the Je&s;uit's Compari&s;on it was believ'd that &s;ome <HI>Portugal</HI> Souldier had quarter'd with his Wife, which was the rea&s;on of that more than u&s;ual Production.</P>
<P>To conclude, there was a certain woman, the wife of one of the Coun&s;ellors of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who had both kindne&s;s and affection for a Merchant of the Fort, who was both young and hand&s;om. And it is the Cu&s;tom in that Coun|trey to be not onely kind but free, &s;he had for &s;everal years &s;o well &s;upplied his wants, that he was Company for the be&s;t. It happen'd that this Coun&s;ellor was &s;ent abroad up|on
<PB N="87" REF="474">
&s;ome Negotiation, and &s;taid longer than he thought he &s;hould have done. For this rea&s;on Money grew &s;hort with the Lady; &s;o that her Gallant coming for a Supply, and &s;he not having ready money to an&s;wer his Expectations, &s;he gave him a Gold Chain worth 400 Crowns to pawn for his pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities till &s;he could redeem it. But this Fatal Chain was the di&s;&s;olution of all their former Love: For the young Gentleman being &s;treighten'd for Money, and find|ing no per&s;on that would lend him &s;o much Money as he wanted upon it, very fairly goes and offers it to a Gold&s;mith to &s;ell. While this unfortunate Lover was driving his Bar|gain in the Shop, who in the name of ill luck &s;hould come by but one of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Slaves, and &s;pying the Chain in his hand, runs and tells her Patrone&s;s how &s;he had &s;een her Gallant imploy'd. Who &s;urpriz'd that her Gallant &s;hould go about to &s;ell the Chain, when he had onely promis'd to pawn it in private and &s;ure hands; now (quoth &s;he) all will out, there will be the Devil upon Dun when my Husband comes home; and I for&s;ooth that have liv'd credibly thus long, mu&s;t be the &s;port of my Neighbours and the talk of the Town. This produc'd a Duel between Love and In|tere&s;t, wherein Intere&s;t getting the victory, away &s;he im|mediately &s;ends to all the Gold&s;miths, to give them notice that &s;he had been robb'd of a Gold Chain, de&s;iring them to apprehend the Party that brought it. She al&s;o gave the &s;ame notice to the chief of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and de&s;ir'd the Advocate Fi&s;cal to make a public Search. Well, by the&s;e means the Chain was quickly found, and the Merchant whatever he could &s;ay for him&s;elf was apprehended and put in pri&s;on; &s;oon after he was condemned for a Thief, and &s;entenced to row all his life in the Stone Galley, which is the Galley that fetches Stones for the u&s;e of <HI>Batavia.</HI> But happy for him, General <HI>Vanderlin</HI>'s Lady falling into a hard Labour before the time of Execution, and de&s;iring his Pardon at &s;uch a &s;olemn Juncture, ea&s;ily obtain'd it, &s;ea&s;onably reco|vering him from the Misfortunes of Folly and Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof are Va&s;&s;als and Tributaries to <HI>Japon.</HI> Neverthele&s;s a <HI>Holland</HI> Pilot, who has been indu&s;trious to di&s;cover whether the whole Country it &s;elf were an I&s;land, or a Continent adjoyning to that va&s;t Tract of Land call'd <HI>Corca,</HI> unknown to this day, in tho&s;e parts where it extends it &s;elf behind <HI>China</HI> to the bottom of <HI>Tartarie Niulhan,</HI> &s;aith, that it is &s;eparated from <HI>Japon</HI> by a narrow Sea, which at this day is call'd <HI>The Streights of</HI> Sanguar. Through all the I&s;lands of <HI>Japon,</HI> where formerly were accompted to have been 66 Kingdoms, there are three remarkable for their largene&s;s, of which that of large&s;t extent is called <HI>Niphon,</HI> the next <HI>Ximo,</HI> and the third <HI>Xicock.</HI> The <HI>Japonners</HI> accompt it a Journey of twenty &s;even days from the Province of <HI>Quanto,</HI> to the Country of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o;</HI> and they &s;ay farther, that this Country of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o,</HI> in tho&s;e parts which are remote from the Sea, is &s;o full of inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains, that tho&s;e <HI>Japonners</HI> who have attempted a di&s;covery by Land, could never accompli&s;h their de&s;ign, being di&s;courag'd by the length of the Journey, and the difficulties and badne&s;s of the ways.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Niphon</HI> is four times as big as the other two; and there is al&s;o a Mountain therein that vomits up Flames of Fire, like Mount <HI>Etna</HI> in <HI>Sicity;</HI> formerly it was di&s;tingui&s;h'd into thirty five Kingdoms, but at this day it is only divided into five parts, the names whereof are <HI>Jama&s;oit, Jet&s;en, Jet&s;e&s;en, Quanto,</HI> and <HI>Ochio,</HI> lying all in order as you travel from We&s;t to Ea&s;t. The&s;e five parts are again divided into &s;everal Provinces. The I&s;land of <HI>Ximo,</HI> or <HI>Saycock,</HI> is &s;ituated to the South-We&s;t of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 160 Leagues in circuit. The I&s;land of <HI>Xicock</HI> is &s;eated by the South of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 120 Leagues in compa&s;s. The other I&s;lands that lye round about are not &s;o con&s;iderable, for in tho&s;e Seas lye &s;everal I&s;lands &s;catter'd up and down, as in the <HI>Archi|pelago,</HI> between the <HI>Morea</HI> and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the le&s;s. As to the re&s;t, I refer the Reader to the Map annexed, believing it to be very true, as having been made upon the places them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Emperour at pre&s;ent keeps his Court in the City of <HI>Yeddo,</HI> in regard the Air is there more temperate, and the Heats not &s;o violent; but when he has a Son that is arriv'd to the Age of fifteen years, he &s;ends him to <HI>Surunga,</HI> there to re&s;ide, till the death of his Father makes him way to the Throne.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Yeddo</HI> has been made choice of for the Seat of the Empire, it has &s;o greatly enlarg'd it &s;elf from day to day, that it is at pre&s;ent three Leagues in length, and three in breadth, very populous, and the Hou&s;es &s;tanding very clo&s;e together. When the Emperour rides through the City, or that there is any publick &s;hew to be &s;een, it is impo&s;&s;ible to get by the crowd of the people, though the Women are not permitted to be of the number. The Emperours Palace is cover'd with Plates of Gold, to which the Palaces of the Lords are every way corre&s;pondent in Mag|nificence; &s;o that afar off the City affords the riche&s;t and mo&s;t magnifi|cent Pro&s;pect that was ever beheld: Though it be not &s;o beautiful within, by rea&s;on that the ordinary Hou&s;es are built only of Wood. The Great <HI>Dairy</HI> keeps his re&s;idence at <HI>Meaco,</HI> which is al&s;o a very large City, containing above a hundred thou&s;and Hou&s;es; it was formerly the capital Seat of the Empire, at what time the <HI>Dairy</HI>'s were laid a&s;ide. So &s;oon as he is Crown'd by the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> who are the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> he is then no more to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the light of the Moon, nor to
<PB N="3" REF="480">
&s;have his Head, or cut his Nails. The Natives report, that the Empire of <HI>Japon</HI> was formerly govern'd by a Prince call'd <HI>Dairy,</HI> who had acquir'd &s;o high a reputation for Holine&s;s, that his Subjects ador'd him as a God, and that to increa&s;e the awe and reverence of the people, he &s;uffer'd his Hair and Nails to grow, affirming, that it it was a piece of Sacriledge to make u&s;e either of Razor or Sizzars. The Princes that &s;ucceeded him, though they had only the name of Kings, have &s;till pre&s;erv'd the &s;ame cu&s;tom, believing that it becomes not their Gran|deur to appear in view of the Moon, as being Sons of the <HI>Sun.</HI> If he have a Daughter that is ripe for Marriage, the Emperour is oblig'd to Marry her, and &s;he it is that bears the Title of Empre&s;s, though &s;he &s;hould happen to have no Children, which is contrary to the Maxims of all the Ea&s;tern Monarchs, who give the Title of Queen and Sulta|ne&s;s only to her, among all the re&s;t of their Wives, that is fir&s;t brought to Bed of a Male Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown.</P>
<P>At the end of every &s;even years, the Emperour &s;ends one of the chief Princes of his Court to the <HI>Dairy</HI> with a Basket full of Earth, and to tell him, that all the Lands which the Emperour commands, are at the <HI>Dairy</HI>'s Devotion; and indeed the Empire belongs to him by right of Succe&s;&s;ion, though at pre&s;ent he enjoys only the Title, and very large Revenues, which render him highly con&s;iderable in the Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are Idolaters, and adore the Sun; but though they have a great number of Temples and different Idols, yet they are not over ob&s;tinate in their Devotion, only the Emperour is very &s;evere again&s;t all other Religions. They never &s;tir out of their Native Country to travel, unle&s;s it be to <HI>China,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o;</HI> and within the&s;e few years the Emperour has prohibited his people under extream penal|ties, from having any Commerce with Foreigners, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> excepted. He had receiv'd Amba&s;&s;adours at &s;everal times from &s;everal Princes, but never &s;ent any of his own to them again. Neverthele&s;s it is affirm'd, that &s;everal Lords of the&s;e I&s;lands newly converted to the Faith, in the year 1585, &s;ent their Children to <HI>Rome,</HI> to render their acknowledgments to <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth; and that being return'd back in the year 1587, to <HI>Goa,</HI> they were afterwards receiv'd, and welcom'd again into their own Country with great marks of joy. The little inclination which they have to Navigation and Traffick, proceeds in part from the great abundance of all things nece&s;|&s;ary for Human &s;upport, which their own Country produces; and then in the next place from the jealou&s;ies of the Emperour, who is afraid of the alterations which new Religions may make in his Government; for they are very fickle, and ea&s;ily &s;educ'd after Novelties, which has been the occa&s;ion of many Revolts, and Civil Wars, till <HI>Quabacondon</HI> wre&s;ted the Empire out of the hands of the <HI>Dairy,</HI> and reunited all the Provinces. They are &s;o fiery and revengeful, that upon the lea&s;t affront given them, if they cannot have an opportunity of a pre&s;ent revenge, they will rip up their own Bellies, and kill them&s;elves. I was told a Story to confirm this. Two young Lords that &s;erv'd the Emperour met in the Palace, and jo&s;tl'd one the other by accident; and mo&s;t furious of the two was immediately for drawing his Sword. The other told him, the place was not convenient, that he was going to wait; but that if he would &s;tay for him in &s;uch a place, he would give him &s;atisfaction. Accordingly the party that thought him&s;elf affronted went and &s;tay'd, but
<PB N="4" REF="481">
his impatience was &s;uch, that after he had &s;tay'd a while, not finding the other to come, he ripp'd up his own Bowels for very vexation. Upon which the people crowding about him, ask'd him the rea&s;on of his killing him&s;elf; to which they could draw no other an&s;wer but this, <HI>A cowardly Raskal has affronted me.</HI> By and by the other comes, makes way through the throng, and &s;urpriz'd with what he beheld; <HI>Poor Creature,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou need'st not have doubted my being as good as my word, this Dagger &s;hall a&s;&s;ure thee of it:</HI> And &s;o &s;aying, he kill'd him&s;elf upon the place, and fell by the others &s;ide.</P>
<P>There is no Nation under Heaven that fears Death le&s;s than this, or that is more enclin'd to cruelty. If any Prince or great Lord makes a Fea&s;t for his Friends, at the end of the Fea&s;t he calls his principal Offi|cers, and asks 'em, if there be any that has &s;o much love for him as to kill him&s;elf before the Gue&s;ts for his &s;ake. Pre&s;ently there ari&s;es a di&s;pute among them who &s;hall have the Honour; and who ever the Prince is pleas'd to name, rips up his Belly with a <HI>Cric,</HI> which is a kind of Dagger, the poynt whereof is Poy&s;on'd. This cu&s;tom is al&s;o practis'd upon the Death of their Ma&s;ters, or when they lay the Foun|dations of any Palace; for they are &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to believe, that the&s;e Victims are nece&s;&s;ary to render both the Owners of the Building, and the Habitation fortunate.</P>
<P>They puni&s;h all manner of Theft with Death. 'Tis al&s;o a capital Crime among them to play for Money. Adultery is only puni&s;h'd in the Women: But Coynage of fal&s;e Money, &s;etting Hou&s;es on Fire, Deflowring and Ravi&s;hing of Virgins, are not only puni&s;h'd in the per&s;ons of the Criminals, but al&s;o of tho&s;e who are next of kin to them. The Women live retir'd, and are very faithful to their Husbands. The Emperour having put to Death one of the Lords of his Court, out of hopes to enjoy his Wife; &s;he fearing violence, be&s;ought the Emperour to give her time to con&s;ider, which was granted for &s;ome few days. At the end whereof &s;he &s;hut her &s;elf up in a Room with her Children; and after &s;he had delivered a Paper to one of her Servants to carry to the Emperour, &s;he &s;et the Chamber a Fire, and burnt both her &s;elf and her Children. The Emperour met with nothing el&s;e in the Paper but reproaches of his Tyranny, and atte&s;tations of joy from the Lady, that &s;he had the opportunity to Sacrifice her &s;elf to the memory of her Hu&s;|band. Several other &s;tories I hav heard, which make me believe, that this Nation is not uncapable of doing actions worthy a <HI>Roman</HI> Vertue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were the fir&s;t people of <HI>Europe</HI> that di&s;cover'd the I&s;lands of <HI>Japon.</HI> They were thrown upon the Coa&s;t by a violent Storm, in the year 1542, and under&s;tanding that there was great &s;tore of Gold and Silver in the Country, they return'd with a re&s;olution to &s;ettle them|&s;elves. The fir&s;t place where they thought to fix was neer <HI>Surunga,</HI> a City which &s;tands about four Leagues from the Sea: But becau&s;e there is but one Road, and that not very &s;ecure neither for Shipping, they remain'd there not above five years. At length they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little for&s;aken I&s;land call'd <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> which they peopl'd afterward's; but &s;ince the la&s;t Per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were forc'd to abandon it, having no more Commerce with the <HI>Japonners.</HI> How the <HI>Hollanders</HI> came to erect their Factories there, I &s;hall tell the Reader in another part of this Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="481">
Seven years after the fir&s;t coming of the <HI>Portugals</HI> to <HI>Japon,</HI> St. <HI>Francis Xavier</HI> made a Voyage thither to Preach the Go&s;pel. The fir&s;t place where he Landed was the I&s;land of <HI>Niphon,</HI> where he &s;tay'd two years and &s;ome Months, and travel'd &s;everal parts of the&s;e I&s;lands; but his principal de&s;ign being to go to <HI>China,</HI> he took &s;hipping accordingly. The Ve&s;&s;el was no &s;ooner out at Sea, but St. <HI>Francis</HI> fell &s;ick, &s;o that the Captain put him a&s;hore again in the I&s;land of <HI>Sechen,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Haynan,</HI> belonging to <HI>China,</HI> where in a few days after he dy'd, and never was in <HI>China,</HI> as &s;ome have reported and believ'd.</P>
<P>After his death the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;pread it &s;elf very much in <HI>China,</HI> the people being very docible, and apprehen&s;ive of the in&s;tructions which were given them; but the behaviour of the <HI>Portugals</HI> di&s;plea&s;ing the Principal Governours, and tho&s;e who had mo&s;t Power at Court, they did them ill Offices to the Emperour, and the <HI>Bonzes</HI> mi&s;liking the new Religion, and jealous of the effects thereof, were the fomenters of continual per&s;ecutions again&s;t the new Converts, pretending they favour'd the de&s;igns of the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Chri&s;tian Religion daily got footing, and perhaps the whole Nation would have embrac'd it, if the covetou&s;ne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s of the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves had not been the chief impediment of their conver&s;ion. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> did all they could to lay the fault upon the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but the truth will ea&s;ily appear by the Letter written to one <HI>Leonard Campen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> wherein it is &s;aid, that when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were ask'd by the Natives what Religion they were of, they made this an&s;wer, <HI>We are no Chri&s;tians, we are</HI> Hollanders. I do not go about to blemi&s;h a whole Nation for the fault of a few, but only to &s;hew what a dangerous thing it is, to make an ill choice of Officers upon the &s;etling of a new Commerce in Regions &s;o remote.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company having &s;et out a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Batavia,</HI> put aboard about a dozen young Boys, and as many Girls, taken out of the Ho&s;pitals in the Country. Among the&s;e Boys there was one who was de&s;ign'd to &s;erve in the Kitchin, but Fortune made him an In&s;tru|ment of one of the greate&s;t Misfortunes that ever befell our Age. During the Voyage, the Merchant having ob&s;erv'd him to be a Boy of a ready wit, and for that rea&s;on believing that he might one day prove &s;er|viceable to the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, caus'd him to be taught to write and read; wherein he improv'd &s;o well in a &s;hort time, that being come to <HI>Batavia,</HI> he was thought capable of a higher Employment. The Ve&s;&s;el being arriv'd, the General and his Council re&s;olv'd to &s;end the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el to <HI>Japon,</HI> with &s;ome part of the Lading which was brought from <HI>Europe.</HI> Thereupon the Merchant was commanded upon this Voyage, and the under Accomptant happening in the mean time to dye, this Boy was by him advanc'd to the place, and by the Merchant carefully in&s;tructed in the knowledge of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el being arriv'd at <HI>Firando,</HI> the new under Accomptant believing no place more proper for him then that to rai&s;e his fortune, re&s;olv'd to leave his Benefactor, and therefore when the Ship was to return, he hid him&s;elf out of the way, till he knew the Ship to be far enough onward on her Voyage, and by that means becoming a Member of the Factory, he grew &s;o perfect in the Language of the Natives, and &s;o u&s;eful to the Company, that at length he came to be Pre&s;ident of the Factory; the Authority of which Employment &s;o puff'd him
<PB N="6" REF="482">
up, that he was not only for continuing and upholding the Commerce of his own, but excluding all other Nations. Now, as I have already ob&s;erv'd, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were the fir&s;t Traders, and the fir&s;t that propa|gated the Chri&s;tian Religion in tho&s;e parts; therefore it was that the Chri&s;tian <HI>Japonners</HI> would not Trade with any but the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as having known them longer, and finding them more true to their words. This the Pre&s;ident ob&s;erv'd, and made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to render them obnoxious at Court, and by vertue of his Pre&s;ents, engag'd the Gover|nours of Provinces, and other great Lords, to favour his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Portugals</HI> wanted neither friends nor confederates. And though they were not in a condition to be &s;o liberal as the Pre&s;ident, yet they made a&s;hift to defend them&s;elves, and render his under-hand Dealings ineffectual. Thereupon finding that tho&s;e Tricks would not take, he had recour&s;e to the foule&s;t of Calumnies; for he counter|feited a Letter written in the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language, containing a di&s;co|very of a de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Japonners</HI> to have made a general In|&s;urrection, and a particular Con&s;piracy again&s;t the per&s;on of the Em|perour. This Letter he carry'd to a Lord of the Country, into who&s;e favour and confidence he had wrought him&s;elf, who pre&s;ently thought it to be his duty to give intelligence of &s;o important a de&s;ign to the Court.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident inform'd him by what accident the Letter came to his hands, and gave an account of &s;uch circum&s;tances, as made his Impo|&s;ture look with a probable countenance, relating, how that the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> had taken a <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;el returning from <HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> and that the <HI>Holland</HI> Captain having taken this Letter among other Papers, open'd it, and perceiving of what con&s;equence it was, had &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Pre&s;ident to proceed as his prudence, and the affection of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company toward the Emperour &s;hould guide him. That the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who were but Subjects to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had a pernicious Maxim, not to &s;uffer any Religon but their own in any place where they had to do, and that for their own ends they never &s;par'd either the Life or Liberty of Man; that they thought it an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to cut the Throats of tho&s;e whom they could not convert. And la&s;tly, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were a people that accorded with all Nations and Religions, and minded nothing but their Trade.</P>
<P>The Lord believ'd all the&s;e fraudulent Calumnies, and &s;ent a Copy of the Letter to the Emperour, the &s;ub&s;tance whereof was, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> being in confederacy with the Chri&s;tians of the Country, had &s;ent to the Gover|nour of <HI>Goa</HI> to &s;end by a time prefix'd eight or ten Ve&s;&s;els, with Men and Arms, but e&s;pecially a good number of Officers to command the Revolters, for that then there would be a numerous Army ready, and that they &s;hould ea&s;ily make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were then under the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and though they would &s;uffer no <HI>Spaniard</HI> in their <HI>Indian</HI> Acqui&s;itions but the Viceroy, yet &s;everal of the Religious Orders did &s;lip into <HI>Japon,</HI> carried thither by a true and real zeal; yet this zeal, when once indi&s;|creet, does as much mi&s;chief as covetou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf. The Father <HI>Pau|li&s;ts,</HI> for &s;o they call the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by rea&s;on that their Church in <HI>Goa</HI> is dedicated to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> the&s;e <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> I &s;ay, had made a fair pro|gre&s;s, and gain'd great credit among the people, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="7" REF="482">
their continual per&s;ecutions, according as the Lords of the Country were well or ill affected towards them. Their number therefore encreas'd, and the new Converts had this advantage, that they enrich'd them&s;elves by Trading with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who had made a po&s;itive Agreement not to Trade with the <HI>Bonzes.</HI> This provok'd the <HI>Bonzes</HI> again&s;t them, and the multitude of the Chri&s;tians &s;o far augmented the Emperour's jealou&s;ies and fears, that in a &s;hort time they produc'd the effects of open rage and cruelty.</P>
<P>The <HI>je&s;uits</HI> had converted to the Faith a great Lord of the Kingdom, who liv'd mo&s;t commonly at <HI>Bugen,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Ximo,</HI> a per&s;on of great Intere&s;t and Power in the I&s;land. He had four Sons, two of which liv'd with him, and following his Example, had embrac'd the Catholick Faith. The Father was Baptiz'd by the name of <HI>Ignatius;</HI> the elde&s;t of the two was call'd <HI>Francis,</HI> and the younge&s;t <HI>Charles:</HI> the two elde&s;t Sons were at Court in great favour with the Emperour. The younger of the two that had embrac'd the Chri&s;tian Religion, ad|dicted him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of the Scripture, and retir'd with the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> to their Seminary. His Example had wrought with a great number of young Lords, and as he was eloquent be&s;ides, he was of great u&s;e to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in preaching the Go&s;pel, and reclaiming the people from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their Errors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are naturally endow'd with a noble mind, and great inclination to Learning; &s;o that there is nothing wanting in that Nation but able Teachers. Not but that they have Doctors of their own: the <HI>Dairy</HI>'s Court is full of them; where they pre&s;erve the Annals of their Country, and pretend that Printing and Artillery were in u&s;e among them before they were known in <HI>Europe.</HI> From this Court come all their Books, in regard the per&s;ons that attend upon this Prince apply them&s;elves only to their Studies. It is reported, that they learnt all the&s;e things by their frequent Commerce with the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and that they are al&s;o originally de&s;cended from them. And in truth, the greate&s;t Pro|vince of the I&s;land of <HI>Niphon</HI> is call'd <HI>Quanto,</HI> according to the name of the Sea-Coa&s;t part of <HI>China,</HI> where lies the greate&s;t Traffick be|tween the <HI>Japonners</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> Moreover, if there be any credit to be given to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tories, they &s;ay it was but a &s;mall part of their va&s;t Empire, which extended it &s;elf from North to South 56 Degrees of Latitude, from the Frozen Sea to the Equinoctial Line, being boun|ded to the We&s;t by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and extending Ea&s;tward over all the Southern <HI>America</HI> to <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Thomas Barr,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> has often told me when I was at <HI>Agra,</HI> a capital City of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have a very &s;air Hou&s;e, that this and &s;everal other young Lords improv'd them&s;elves &s;o far in &s;ix or &s;even years, that they were as Learned as their Ma&s;ters them&s;elves, and that they were more zealous in converting tho&s;e of their Nation. Now the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at that time had no Hou&s;e for the In&s;truction of Youth and Pro&s;elytes, and therefore they de&s;ir'd this young Lord to lend them one of his. Thereupon he having four very fair ones, with great Revenues belonging to them, gave that which was neare&s;t to the City to his Converters. A while after, the younge&s;t of his Sons fell &s;ick, and was carried to this Hou&s;e for the Air's &s;ake, where he recover'd by the care of the Fathers, and the Prayers of the Chri&s;tians; but his Father did not long enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;o great

a Cure, which &s;eem'd almo&s;t miraculous; for he dy'd at what time both his Sons and the Chri&s;tians &s;tood mo&s;t in need of his protection.</P>
<P>The two elde&s;t, who were with the Emperour, under&s;tanding the the Death of their Father, came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Inheritance, and demanded of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> the Hou&s;e which their Father had given them, for in <HI>Japon</HI> no Parent can alienate the E&s;tate of his Children; nay, when they come to &s;uch an Age, he is oblig'd to put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their E&s;tates, re&s;erving only &s;uch a proportion to him&s;elf. The <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> loth to part with &s;o fair a convenience, would not quit their hold, though it were for their own quiet, and to engage the whole Family to &s;tand by them in their time of trouble. This refu&s;al pro|vok'd the two Brethren, and this quarrel between them and the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> happen'd at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident was labouring to bring about his de&s;igns. He had notice of this di&s;pute, and as he was a great Impo&s;tor, he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to enflame the two Brothers, not only again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> but again&s;t the <HI>Portugals</HI> in general, giving them a Copy of the Letter which he had fram'd, as is before-men|tion'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Lords, who were Favourites of the Emperour, joyning Intere&s;t of State to their particular Intere&s;t, made their complaints at Court, with extraordinary aggravations; urging that there was no &s;ecurity for the E&s;tates of particular Men, for the quiet of the Empire, nor the Life of the Prince, unle&s;s not only all the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but al&s;o all the Natives of <HI>Japon,</HI> who had &s;uck'd their Errors, were exterminated out of the I&s;land. To make good the rea&s;ons of their Exa&s;peration they &s;hew'd the Emperour a Copy of the Letter, and put him into &s;uch a fright, as well for his Per&s;on, as the Empire, that he would admit of no ju&s;tification on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Some of his Lords, who were Friends to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> be&s;ought him to examin the truth of what was alledg'd, before he proceeded to utmo&s;t extremities again&s;t a whole Nation, and again&s;t his own Subjects. But he was inexorable, and pre&s;ently gave private Orders to certain Commi&s;&s;ioners, to go through all the Provinces of the Empire, and to bani&s;h not only the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but al&s;o all the Chri&s;tian Natives. Now in regard they had their private confederates, as well in the Court, as in other places, they had intelligence, in all parts, of the cruel re&s;olution tak'n again&s;t them, though none were more zealous and faithful to them then the two Lords of <HI>Ximo, Francis</HI> and <HI>Charles.</HI> Thereupon the Chri&s;tians met together to con&s;ult for their own &s;afety, and their common pre&s;ervation, and &s;eeing all attempts to ju&s;tifie them&s;elves prove ineffectual, they re&s;olv'd to &s;tand upon their guards, and to dye in the defence of their Innocency and Religion. The two Lords put them&s;elves at the head of the Chri&s;tians Army, the elder of which had been a Souldier, and under&s;tood the Art of War; the younger kept up their Spirits and Courages by his continual Exhortations.</P>
<P>The Emperour's Commi&s;&s;ioners under&s;tanding that the Chri&s;tians were thus embody'd, gave him &s;peedy notice thereof, but &s;aid nothing either of the number of their Forces, or of their de&s;igns. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tin Fryars</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, that the Army of the Chri&s;tians con|&s;i&s;ted of above 40000 Men, be&s;ides tho&s;e recruits that came up to them before and after the Battel was fought.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="483">
The Emperour not beleiving that the Army was &s;o numerous, &s;ent again&s;t them at fir&s;t not above 25 or 30000 Men, under the Com|mand of the younge&s;t of the two Lords of <HI>Ximo,</HI> that liv'd at Court. But tho&s;e Troops were no &s;ooner upon their March, but he rais'd new Forces, and &s;ent another Army after them, con&s;i&s;ting of 40000 Men, commanded by the young Lord, to whom the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident had &s;hew'd the Letter fir&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians having intelligence of the approach of the&s;e two Armies, prepar'd to receive them, choo&s;ing an advantagious place to intrench them&s;elves. The fir&s;t Army &s;oon appear'd in &s;ight of the Chri&s;tians, who lay &s;o encamp'd, that the Imperiali&s;ts could di&s;cover no more than one part of them. However, before the Engagement, the younge&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Brothers advis'd his other Brother to &s;end to the General of the Emperour's Army, who was their Brother likewi&s;e, to de&s;ire Peace, and to be&s;eech him to intercede for them to the Emperour, and to a&s;&s;ure him, that they were ready to lay down their Arms, and throw them&s;elves at his Feet, and to ju&s;tifie their Innocency. To this purpo&s;e a Letter was fram'd and &s;ent to the General, but the Me&s;&s;enger that carry'd it was nail'd to a Cro&s;s in &s;ight of the whole Army of the Chri&s;tians, and at the &s;ame time the Enemy came on with great fury to a&s;&s;ail them.</P>
<P>The Fight la&s;ted almo&s;t three hours with equal advantage; the Cap|tain of the Imperiali&s;ts &s;eeking every where for his Brothers, while they &s;trove to avoid him. The Chri&s;tians, who knew that all their &s;afety con&s;i&s;ted in their Victory, and that there was otherwi&s;e no hope of par|don, fought with &s;o much valour, that the Imperiali&s;ts were forc'd to give ground. Their General was &s;lain upon the place, and at length the whole Army of the Idolaters was cut in pieces.</P>
<P>This Victory wrought the Conver&s;ion of &s;everal of the Idolaters; and the Chri&s;tians, after they had given thanks to God three days toge|ther, prepar'd them&s;elves for a &s;econd Combat, not doubting but the other Army would &s;et upon them while they were weary, and weaken'd by the la&s;t Battel. But that General more prudent then the former, only po&s;ted him&s;elf where the Chri&s;tians could not come at him, and writ to the Court the particulars of the Defeat of the fir&s;t Army, upon which he expected the Emperour's Orders.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Army of the Chri&s;tians daily encreas'd, &s;o that in a few days they were above fifty thou&s;and &s;trong. The Emperour, re&s;olv'd to &s;tifle this Revolt in the beginning, &s;ent Orders through all his Empire to make new Levies; and all the while the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident's Confederates ceas'd not to aggravate him again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, not &s;uffering the other Courtiers to open his Eyes, and prevent &s;o unju&s;t a pro&s;ecution. The defeat of his Army had put him into &s;uch a rage be|&s;ides, that though the Captains of the Chri&s;tians Army did all they could to clear them&s;elves from the fal&s;e accu&s;ations laid upon them, and to obtain their pardons, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of being heard.</P>
<P>The Emperour call'd his Council, where the wi&s;e&s;t were of opinion, that it would prove the be&s;t way to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of the Chri|&s;tians, who offer'd to lay down their Arms upon a general pardon, and the free exerci&s;e of their Religion. But the Pre&s;ident's Cabal carry'd it beyond this &s;ober advice, and the Emperour, exa&s;perated by his Impo|&s;tures, took the wrong cour&s;e. Thereupon the Council re&s;olv'd with

all &s;peed to rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e a va&s;t Army, which was to joyn with the other, and &s;o to rum the Chri&s;tians all at a blow. The <HI>Dairy</HI> al&s;o, who is con|&s;ulted upon all important affairs, approv'd this Council. Thereupon the Lords who are oblig'd to furni&s;h the Emperour with Men, &s;trove who &s;hould bring their Troops and Companies fir&s;t to the Randevouz appointed, which was neer the place where the &s;econd Army lay; &s;o that when both Armies were joyn'd together, there was in the Field a Body of 150000 Men. The Brother of the General, who was &s;lain in the fir&s;t Battel, commanded under the Emperour, who re&s;olv'd to go in per&s;on.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t of all he caus'd a Proclamation to be made in his Camp, whereby he forbad any Quarter to be given to any Chri&s;tian, unle&s;s it were the two Brothers, whom he intended to puni&s;h openly; and that they who left the Field before the Chri&s;tians were bani&s;h'd, &s;hould be put, they and their Kindred, to the mo&s;t cruel Deaths that could be imagin'd; but that they &s;hould be rewarded that brought the Head of a Chri&s;tian to the Emperour. The Copies of this Proclamation were &s;catter'd in the Army of the Chri&s;tians, though they did no harm but only encou|rag'd them again&s;t the Idolaters, &s;eeing there was no hope of pardon.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the younge&s;t of the two Brothers offer'd to go and throw him&s;elf at the Emperour's Feet, to implore his clemency in the name of the whole Army; &s;aying withall, That he &s;hould accompt him&s;elf happy to &s;uffer Martyrdom to &s;hew his Innocency; but they would not &s;uffer him to &s;tir. All he could obtain from them, was to write a Letter full of re&s;pect, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and repentanoe for what had been already done, declaring that they were ready to lay down their Arms, if the Emperour would grant them pardon, and the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion&punc; offering with the hazard of their Lives to make out the fal&s;ity of all tho&s;e things wherewith they had been accus'd.</P>
<P>This was by an Idolater carry'd to a certain Lord who &s;ecretly favour'd the Chri&s;tians; but the Emperour toar it without reading it, vowing at the &s;ame time, that he would never return to his Court 'till the Idola|ters were all extirpated. The Chri&s;tian Army under&s;tanding the Em|perour's re&s;olution, minded nothing more then their own defence. 'Tis true, the Ground where they lay was advantagious enough for the &s;mallne&s;s of their Number, but the Idolaters were three to one; be&s;ides that the Idolaters of the Country, who favour'd the Chri&s;tians before, now declar'd all again&s;t them &s;o &s;oon as they &s;aw the Imperial Army. So that now both Armies lying &s;o near together, &s;everal hot Skirmi&s;hes pa&s;s'd between 'em&punc; and at length it came to a general Battel. At fir&s;t the Chri&s;tians overthrew the Idolaters, not able to &s;tand before them: with &s;o much vigour did the younge&s;t of their Chieftains a&s;&s;ail them. He was remarkable for his Habit that day, but more remarkable for his courage; &s;o that the Field was cover'd with the Bodies of the &s;lain, fear and dread po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the yielding Enemy. But while the Victor forgot his Brother's advice, and pur&s;u'd too far from the Body of the Army, he was encompa&s;s'd on every &s;ide, wounded, and being carried away by the pre&s;s of his Enemies, was at length taken, and lead before the Emperour. His elde&s;t Brother, more experienc'd in War, rally'd and recall'd tho&s;e that had follow'd his Brother, and till Night maintain'd the advantages, which he had got over the Imperiali&s;ts, who were &s;till &s;upply'd with fre&s;h Succours, as nece&s;&s;ity requir'd. The next day the Fight
<PB N="11" REF="484">
was renew'd again by break of day, and with a &s;ucce&s;s as honourable, but more bloody to the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The third day the Emperour enrag'd at &s;uch a re&s;i&s;tance, caus'd them to be &s;et upon in &s;everal places at one time. The General of the Chri|&s;tians Army rode from Rank to Rank, encouraging the Souldiers both by his Exhortations, and his Example: but at length having receiv'd &s;everal wounds, he was overlaid by the multitude of his Enemies that crouded to his de&s;truction. And now the General being lo&s;t, and the Chri&s;tians having no per&s;on to command them, it ceas'd to be a Com|bat, and became a Ma&s;&s;acre. However, re&s;olving to dye with their Swords in their hands, they flung them&s;elves into the thicke&s;t of their Enemies, and Sacrific'd them&s;elves to their own Innocency. Their Camp was &s;oon forc'd, and all the old Men, Women, and Children put to the Sword, except &s;ome few that e&s;cap'd and hid them&s;elves in the Mountains, who afterwards made a relation of this bloody Story to them who rehears'd it to me.</P>
<P>This was the deplorable end of the Chri&s;tians, and indeed of the Chri&s;tiani&s;me of <HI>Japon,</HI> which the Pre&s;ident procur&punc;d by his impo&s;tures and fallacies. And it has been made appear by three exact accompts, that there has peri&s;h'd, either in Battels or by Tortures, above 60000 Chri|&s;tians. The elde&s;t of their Captains &s;uffer'd a mo&s;t cruel Martyrdom for &s;even days, neither could any offer, that the Emperour could make him for his Brothers and his own Valours &s;ake, induce him to renounce the Chri&s;tian Faith. After that, there was a kind of Inqui&s;ition &s;et up thorough the whole Empire, which la&s;ted for &s;everal years, whereby tho&s;e that per&s;ever'd in the Faith, were condemn'd to mo&s;t intolerable Torments, in &s;o much that the Relation which <HI>Van Varen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who&s;e credit it would be a vanity to que&s;tion in this particular, cannot be read over without Horrour. In &s;ixteen years, that is, from 1613 to 1629, the Chri&s;tians were &s;o multiply'd, that there were above 400000; but in the year 1649, the &s;ame <HI>Hollander</HI> relates, that tho&s;e <HI>Japonners</HI> who were brought from thence by the Company's Ships to <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> affirm'd, that Chri&s;tianity was utterly extirpated out of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Ogli,</HI> a large Town upon the faire&s;t Arm of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> I met a <HI>Holland</HI> Merchant, who had &s;erv'd the Company in <HI>Japon</HI> a long time, and had made &s;everal Voyages. He came thither with two Ships laden with Bars of Silver and Copper, which he had exchang'd for Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy at <HI>Bengale.</HI> This Merchant know|ing I was there, came to vi&s;it me; and I finding him to be a &s;incere hone&s;t Man, and well ver&s;t in the affairs of <HI>Japan,</HI> e&s;pecially in reference to the la&s;t per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians, grew cove|tous of his conver&s;e, and invited him often to my Hou&s;e. In our familiar di&s;cour&s;es concerning the &s;ettlement of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and of the extraordinary gain which they make by their Trade there, and pa&s;&s;ing thus from one thing to another, at length I ask'd him who was the Author and Contriver of a Ma&s;&s;acre &s;o horrid, as that was reported to be. Whereupon he related to me all the particu|lars of which I have here made a recital, and&punc;many more which I have forgot or omitted, as being either not pertinent to my &s;ubject, or el&s;e already related by others. He had his information from &s;uch of the Natives that had e&s;cap'd out of the Battel, and &s;everal of the Idolater
<PB N="12" REF="485">
Merchants, in who&s;e memories the fact was then fre&s;h: and indeed he was &s;o ingenious in his Story, that I could not find any motive to in|cite me to mi&s;doubt the truth of it. For many times he could not for|bear &s;hedding tears, and to interrupt his di&s;cour&s;e with his &s;ighs, often imprecating Heav'ns Vengeance upon the Pre&s;ident, and prote&s;ting he wonder'd the Company employ'd him &s;o long. But God re&s;erv'd his puni&s;hment to him&s;elf. For the de&s;erts of his crimes always atten|ding him, and provoking judgments and misfortunes upon whatever Enterprize he took in hand, he mi&s;erably peri&s;h'd in &s;ight of <HI>Lisbon</HI> in fair weather. All the men in the Ship were &s;av'd; only he returning to recover a certain Cabinet of Jewels which he had there, the Ship &s;plit, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him &s;wallow'd up in the Sea, who had been the occa&s;ion of the Ruin of &s;o many of their Country-men in <HI>Japon;</HI> and immediately they rang their Bells in the City for joy of his Death.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> I was at <HI>Bandar-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have a Factory. Thither arriv'd two Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Japon</HI> to take in Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to exchange in <HI>Japon.</HI> The Captain of one of the Ships told me, that during &s;everal trading Voyages which he had made to that I&s;land, the Emperour had caus'd two Inqui&s;itions to be made after the Chri&s;tians; in the fir&s;t of which the Inqui&s;itors met with 247, who were all mo&s;t exqui&s;itely tormented to Death; in the latter they only found 63, among whom were &s;eventeen Children, twelve Girls and five Boys, of which the elde&s;t were not above thirteen years of Age.</P>
<P>Among all the per&s;ecutions which the Chri&s;tians &s;uffer'd, there was none comparable to this for extremity of Torments: For the <HI>Japonners</HI> are the mo&s;t ingenious in cruelty of any people in the World, and the mo&s;t con&s;tant in &s;uffering. For there have been Children from ten to a dozen years old, who for 60 days together have endur'd to have their Bodies fa&s;ten'd to the Cro&s;s, half burnt, half torn in pieces, while their Executioners forc'd them to eat, on purpo&s;e to prolong their Lives in mi&s;ery; and yet they would not renounce the Faith which they had embrac'd. Neither did this barbarous Inqui&s;ition extend only to the Chri&s;tians, but to their Kindred and Relations, nay, to their very Neighbours. For if a Prie&s;t were taken in any Hou&s;e, all the people in that Hou&s;e, and the Hou&s;es adjoyning, were hall'd to Execution, for not having made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>At the beginning of every year there is a new Inqui&s;ition, at which time all that can write are requir'd to &s;ub&s;cribe, or el&s;e the chief of the Family &s;ub&s;cribes for all the re&s;t, that they neither are Chri&s;tians, nor are acquainted with any Chri&s;tians, and that they abominate Chri&s;tianity as a Religion dangerous to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Braganza,</HI> being advanc'd to the Crown, that &s;udden change which in one day, and without the lea&s;t Tumult in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> wre&s;ted the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> wrought the &s;ame effect at <HI>Goa.</HI> All the <HI>Portugals</HI> at <HI>Goa</HI> at the &s;ame time acknow|ledg'd their new Soveraign; the Viceroy who was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was &s;ent away to <HI>Spain</HI> by the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;els that were homeward bound; and <HI>Don Philip de Ma&s;carennas,</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> Governour of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> came to <HI>Goa,</HI> and took upon him the command of Viceroy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="485">
So &s;oon as he came to the Government, his fir&s;t thoughts were how to E&s;tabli&s;h the Trade of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> which when they were expell'd, amounted to three Millions of <HI>Pardo's</HI> yearly, one <HI>Pardo</HI> being worth twenty &s;even <HI>Sous</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. The hopes therefore of regaining &s;o great a lo&s;s, made him toward the end of the year 1642, take a re&s;olution to &s;end a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y to the Emperour of <HI>Japon,</HI> fur|ni&s;h'd with magnificent Pre&s;ents: For which rea&s;on he made choice of what was mo&s;t rare, and mo&s;t likely to be acceptable to the Emperour, and the Grandees of his Court. The mo&s;t co&s;tly of the&s;e Pre&s;ents was a piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Wood of Calambour,</HI> four Foot in length, and two Foot in Diameter; a larger piece then which the <HI>Indies</HI> had never &s;een, having co&s;t 40000 <HI>Pardo's.</HI> To this he added a great quantity of fair Coral Beads of an extraordinary bigne&s;s. This is the mo&s;t acceptable Pre&s;ent that can be &s;ent to the Lords of <HI>Japon,</HI> which they fa&s;ten to the Strings wherewith they draw their Pouches together. With the&s;e he &s;ent a great number of Carpets and Hangings of Cloth of Gold, Silver, and Silk, and &s;everal pieces of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver. 'Tis &s;aid the whole Pre&s;ent co&s;t the City of <HI>Goa</HI> above eight hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pardo's,</HI> which amounts to about 86666 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money. Be&s;ides all this, the two great Ships which were prepar'd for the Emba&s;&s;ador, carry'd one of them 50 Peeces of Canon, and the other 35, both laden with all &s;orts of Commodities which are e&s;teem'd and priz'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> amounting to about 83333 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling. The Equipage of the Emba&s;&s;ador was no le&s;s &s;umptuous. And becau&s;e the Viceroy would not be thought to give any occa&s;ion of offence to the Emperour, he would not &s;uffer one <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> in the Train, but only four <HI>Augu&s;tins</HI> for the Admiral, and four <HI>Jacobins</HI> for the other, Men of di&s;cretion and conduct. While I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> in the year 1648, I met with &s;ome of the&s;e Fathers, who gave an exact accompt of the Emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>They made a pro&s;perous Voyage, and arriv'd happily at their in|tended Port. But you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that when any Ship arrives at <HI>Japon,</HI> no per&s;ons are permitted to come a&s;hore, 'till the Governour of the place have an accompt who they are, that they may give notice thereof to the Emperour, and know his plea&s;ure, whether they &s;hall be received or no. In the mean time the Ships rode in a very dangerous place, at the entry of the Haven, into which there was no &s;teering, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Native Pilots.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Nanga&s;aqui</HI> &s;urpriz'd to under&s;tand that they were <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> wrote in all ha&s;t to the Emperour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident being inform'd of the news, play'd all the pranks he could, us'd all the contrivances imaginable to fru&s;trate the &s;ucce&s;s of the Emba&s;&s;y, and to ruine the Ve&s;&s;els that brought the Emba&s;&s;adour and his Pre&s;ents. To which purpo&s;e he found a way to bribe the Courrier, who was &s;ent with the Emperours Orders; &s;o that in&s;tead of twenty days, which were &s;ufficient for his journey, he made it above two Months before he deliver'd his di&s;patches. During which time the two Ships had &s;uffer'd very bad weather upon the Coa&s;ts, and endur'd many a &s;evere Storm. At length the Orders came that none &s;hould be permitted to Land but the Emba&s;&s;adour, the two Captains, and the two Pilots, to give an accompt of the &s;ubject and cau&s;e of their coming. The Emba&s;&s;adour being Landed, acquainted the Governour that he came to compliment
<PB N="14" REF="486">
the Emperour in the behalf of the King his Ma&s;ter, and to a&s;&s;ure him that they were no longer under the Power of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That about a year &s;ince, a lawful Heir of <HI>Portugal</HI> had recover'd the Diadem of his Ance&s;tors which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had u&s;urp'd. That this new King was &s;o ju&s;t and generous a Prince, that under&s;tanding that &s;ome of his Subjects had de&s;erted the I&s;land of <HI>Japon,</HI> without paying their Debts, he had now &s;ent to make a general &s;atisfaction; but chiefly out of that re&s;pect which obliges all Soveraigns newly come to the Crown, to give notice thereof to tho&s;e Princes, who&s;e friend&s;hip they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Governour inform'd the Emperour of all the&s;e things; but the Pre&s;ident having as good intelligence by means of his Friends at Court, alledg'd to the Emperour that they were Rebels, who came from the utmo&s;t parts of the We&s;t, to bring the News and Example of their Revolt to <HI>Japon:</HI> That the natural re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of this Nation caus'd fre|quent di&s;turbances and revolutions among them. That they were never long at re&s;t them&s;elves, nor would &s;uffer others to be at quiet. That con&s;idering the experience he had had, he could not be either too cau|tious for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, or the tranquillity of his Empire. La&s;tly, that the Emperour and the Empire would be ruin'd pa&s;t reco|very, if tho&s;e people were ever admitted to &s;et footing therein.</P>
<P>This Coun&s;el well &s;econded by the re&s;t of the Cabal, ea&s;ily made an impre&s;&s;ion in the Heart of the Prince naturally Barbarous, and an Enemy to the Chri&s;tians. Thereupon he &s;ent an Order to the Gover|nour to invite all the <HI>Whites</HI> aboard, and to treat them for eight days in the be&s;t manner he could. At the end of eight days they were order'd to repair aboard again, and at the &s;ame time he made a Pre&s;ent to the Emba&s;&s;adour, and chief of his Train, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix great Cabinets, and &s;ix Coffers lacker'd with black, with Figures in Relief, intermix'd with &s;pangles of Gold, all the Embelli&s;hments being of Ma&s;&s;ie Gold. With them were &s;ix Cabinets, and &s;ix Coffers, lacker'd with Red, Embelli&s;h'd after the &s;ame manner with Silver. I &s;aw &s;ome of them when I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never beheld any &s;o rare and beautiful in that kind, which made me admire the ingenious Indu&s;try of the Arti&s;ts of <HI>Japon;</HI> Our <HI>European</HI> imitations of their workman&s;hip being no way comparable to them.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;adour having receiv'd his Pre&s;ent, had Order to remove all the Goods in the &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el into the Admiral. He would have made great Pre&s;ents to the Governour, who refus'd them; telling the Emba&s;&s;adour withall, that he had expre&s;s command to refu&s;e them, and to declare to the Emba&s;&s;adour, that if he did not make ha&s;t away, he would &s;ink his Ship. That the Emperour his Ma&s;ter had made a new prohibition, forbidding all <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> to venture near his Dominions upon any pretence what&s;oever; nay, though it were upon pretence of an Emba&s;&s;y, upon pain of being crucifi'd upon the place, without liberty to &s;peak for them&s;elves. As for the Debts of the <HI>Portu|gals,</HI> he had undertaken to di&s;charge them him&s;elf; only he had &s;ent that Pre&s;ent to the King his Ma&s;ter to thank him for that Emba&s;&s;y. The Emba&s;&s;adour had no &s;ooner remov'd the Goods out of the &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el into the Admiral, but they &s;ank her before his face. And not contented with that affront, the Governour &s;ent for all the Blacks that were in the Admiral, and cut off their Heads, pretending they were <HI>Indians,</HI> and that, as &s;uch, they could not be ignorant of the Rigorous prohibitions
<PB N="15" REF="486">
which the Emperour had put forth, forbidding all Strangers, except the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to &s;et footing in <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour was thus barbarou&s;ly fru&s;trated and di&s;mi&s;s'd, he &s;ent News thereof to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> urging him to execute the de&s;ign which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had upon <HI>Macao;</HI> telling him al&s;o, That though there were a probability of a League between the <HI>Hollander</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet that it could be no harm to &s;eize <HI>Macao</HI> beforehand, as they had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of &s;everal places, while the <HI>Portugals</HI> were under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The General taking the Pre&s;ident's advice, was ready to &s;et Sail upon this enterprize, when a Me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Portugal</HI> brought him the News of the Treaty concluded between <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> as al&s;o of the Navy which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Lisbon</HI> to aid the <HI>Portugals.</HI> At fir&s;t he made as if it had been a fal&s;e Rumour, and put the Me&s;&s;enger in Pri&s;on; neverthele&s;s while he delay'd the departure of the Fleet, he receiv'd expre&s;s Orders from his Superiours to Treat the <HI>Portugals</HI> as Friends and Allies. So that he was con&s;train'd to turn all his Forces again&s;t the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident was very &s;orry for the la&s;t News, by rea&s;on that the General and he had great de&s;igns upon the Conque&s;t of that place, and had promis'd the Company by that means to make them ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Trade of <HI>China,</HI> and of all the Ea&s;t. True it is, that <HI>Macao</HI> is very advantagiou&s;ly &s;eated for tho&s;e that de&s;ign to be Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Seas, e&s;pecially upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Fockien,</HI> which are the Provinces, whither are brought down all the Merchandizes of this Empire. It lies at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Canton,</HI> in a &s;mall <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> adjoyning to a larger I&s;land, and built upon a kind of a Pro|montory, on three &s;ides environ'd with the Sea, which no Ship can come neer by rea&s;on of the Flats, unle&s;s it be on that &s;ide next the Port, which is defended by a &s;trong Fortre&s;s. This City drew from the only Fair of <HI>Quanchiu</HI> 1300 Che&s;ts of Silks of all &s;orts, every Che&s;t con|taining 150 pieces, and 2500 Lingots of Gold, not reckoning the raw Silks, the Gold Wire, and other Merchandizes: whence it may be ea&s;ily judg'd what advantage the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> made of it; and wherefore the Pre&s;ident de&s;ir'd &s;o much to expell them from thence.</P>
<P>But his De&s;igns were di&s;appointed, not only by the revolution in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but al&s;o by the lo&s;s which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd of the I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> took from them, following the advice of a <HI>French</HI> Souldier, whom the Governour of <HI>Tayovan</HI> had refus'd to di&s;mi&s;s after his time was out. For the better under&s;tanding this accident, you mu&s;t know that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being &s;etl'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> and having excluded all other Nations from thence, except the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> whom the Emperour permitted to return, after that the Ma&s;&s;acre com|mitted by the <HI>Japonners</HI> in a City of <HI>China,</HI> of which they had a de&s;ire to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, had caus'd a Ce&s;&s;ation of the Commerce between the two Kingdoms, and con&s;train'd the Emperour of <HI>China</HI> to &s;et a price upon the Heads of the <HI>Japonners.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> did all they could to make a new Rupture between the people, or el&s;e them&s;elves to &s;eize upon &s;ome place that lay proper to ruin the Trade of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, not daring to attempt upon the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> they over-ran the Seas which environ'd the neighbouring I&s;lands, and took
<PB N="16" REF="487">
the Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> which were bound for <HI>Macao,</HI> exerci&s;ing &s;trange Cruelties upon the people that had e&s;cap'd into tho&s;e I&s;lands, after the irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into <HI>China. Coxinga,</HI> the Son of <HI>Chinchilunge,</HI> that famous Pirate, who &s;av'd the remainders of that ruin'd Empire, then commanded tho&s;e people, and was become formi|dable to the <HI>Tartars</HI> them&s;elves. Who to revenge him&s;elf upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pirates, undertook the Siege of <HI>Tayovan,</HI> where they u&s;ually retir'd, and by gaining that place drave them wholly out of <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large I&s;land plac'd at the poynt of the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> &s;tretch|ing out in length from North to South, and to the We&s;t lying oppo&s;ite to the Provinces of <HI>Fockien,</HI> and <HI>Quantung.</HI> The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> call it <HI>Tali|eukieu.</HI> Since which time, 'tis very probable that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave it the name of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> from its beauty and fertility. They being the fir&s;t people of <HI>Europe</HI> that di&s;cover'd it, and inhabited it; and upon one of its Promontories to the North built the Fort of <HI>Kiling.</HI> The natu|ral Inhabitants live almo&s;t all in the Woods and Mountains, where they maintain them&s;elves by hunting the Hart, and wild Boar, who&s;e dry'd Fle&s;h, Skins, and Horns they &s;ell to the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who in exchange bring them other nece&s;&s;aries. The little I&s;land of <HI>Tayovan</HI> lent its Name to the little Fort which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built, over again&s;t the great I&s;land; it was very convenient for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who made great advantage of the Cattel, Hides, and Horns, both of Harts and Bufalo's, which they carry'd from thence, and &s;old to the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Japonners,</HI> who make great u&s;e thereof in &s;everal of their Trades and Manufactures. But the chiefe&s;t advantage which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made of this I&s;land con&s;i&s;ted in this, that it lay in the middle way between <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> and &s;erv'd as a place of &s;ecurity for their Ships in bad Sea&s;ons, and to take in refre&s;hments. There al&s;o they laded off &s;everal of the Goods of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> which they took by way of Piracy from the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> or which were brought them by the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who are the Original Merchants of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> &s;etled at the <HI>Philippines,</HI> but who drive the greate&s;t Trade of that Country, independent from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coxinga,</HI> though an Idolater and a Pirate, bani&s;h'd out of his Country, and provok'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had &s;o much humanity as to &s;end to the General at <HI>Batavia</HI> to &s;end away Ve&s;&s;els to fetch away his Men, and de|liver'd them all without &s;uffering them to receive the lea&s;t injury. He had his Friends and Favourers in the Emperour of <HI>Japon</HI>'s Court, as being a declar'd Enemy to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who&s;e neer Neighbourhood the <HI>Japonners</HI> cannot endure. For &s;o quick a Conque&s;t of &s;o many Lands and Provinces in &s;even years, as it were only upon &s;ight of the Enemy, had very much alarum'd them. He by his Friends acquainted the Em|perour of the acts of Ho&s;tility, committed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchants: Adding moreover, that they had made private propo&s;itions to league them&s;elves with the common Enemy; and that it was one of the Nations of the North, born for the de&s;olation of other Countries, and to invade the Peace of Empires. That they had &s;etled them&s;elves in the I&s;lands of the Ea&s;t only by treachery and violence. That for &s;ome years &s;ince, they had made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to crui&s;e the Seas between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> on purpo&s;e to make them&s;elves ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Trade, and that if he did not take a &s;peedy cour&s;e, they would do the &s;ame mi&s;chief in his Dominions which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had done in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="487">
The Pre&s;ident had much ado to divert the Storm, for the mo&s;t potent Lords at Court, although his Pen&s;ioners and Friends, began to open their Eyes, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure took <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s part, &s;aying, That the <HI>Chine&s;e's</HI> were unfortunate enough, in being laid wa&s;t by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> without being per&s;ecuted and afflicted by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> That &s;eeing that after they had been expell'd their Country, they had nothing left but their Boats, and &s;ome few Rocks for their places of refuge, it was a piece of inhumanity to di&s;turb them in their la&s;t Sanctuaries&punc; and to deprive them of their liberty of the Sea, and their Commerce with <HI>Japon,</HI> from whence tho&s;e mi&s;erable Exiles had their chiefe&s;t &s;upport. The <HI>Bonzes,</HI> the Merchants, the vulgar People, all took the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> part. Thereupon the Emperour &s;ent for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pre&s;ident, and told him, I under&s;tand, &s;aid he, that thy Company abu&s;es my Protection, and that their Ve&s;&s;els, in&s;tead of being contented with the Trade which I have permitted them, pre&s;ume to play the Pyrates upon the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and to trouble the Seas adjoyning to my Empire. If I hear any more of the&s;e complaints, I will cau&s;e thee and all thy Nation to be Cru|cifi'd. I know not how the Pre&s;ident appeas'd the Emperour's fury; this I know in general, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a &s;ecret alliance with the <HI>Tartars</HI> again&s;t <HI>Coxinga.</HI> Him the Inhabitants of <HI>Fockien</HI> call'd to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, having rais'd an Army of 200000 Men; whereupon he went to aid them with a very powerful Navy. After &s;everal Skir|mi&s;hes, the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> came to a pitch'd Field, where the Captain of the <HI>Tartars</HI> having plac'd the be&s;t part of his Cavalry in Ambu&s;h, order'd his Men to retreat by degrees, 'till they had drawn the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> into the Ambu&s;cade; at what time the <HI>Tartars</HI> encom|pa&s;&s;ing them on every &s;ide, kill'd 80000 upon the place; <HI>Coxinga</HI> with his Navy not being able to relieve them.</P>
<P>During this War, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took their opportunity, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the I&s;land of <HI>Fi&s;hers,</HI> between <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Fockien.</HI> In a &s;hort while after <HI>Coxinga</HI> dy'd, and <HI>Savia</HI> his Uncle, the riche&s;t Merchant of <HI>China,</HI> who out of his own revenue had disburs'd the expences of the la&s;t War, grew weary of the charge, and was de&s;irous to make Peace with the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Of which one of the Sons of <HI>Coxinga</HI> being advertiz'd, &s;eiz'd upon his Uncles per&s;on, and &s;hut him up in a clo&s;e Pri&s;on, where he kill'd him&s;elf for madne&s;s. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> overjoy'd at the Death of <HI>Savia,</HI> who had always hin|der'd them from the Trade of the Province of <HI>Fockien,</HI> &s;ent a Navy again&s;t his Nephew in favour of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who made War again&s;t him all along the Sea-Coa&s;t. Several Combats happen'd between the <HI>Juncks</HI> of the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> and the <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els in view of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who &s;atisfi'd them&s;elves with being only Spectators. But all the benefit which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> reap'd from the advantages which they obtain'd over the <HI>I&s;landers,</HI> was only to put into the Hands of the <HI>Tartars</HI> the Cities of <HI>Bemos</HI> and <HI>Que&s;moy,</HI> and all the places thereabouts, which <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party po&s;&s;e&s;s'd before. For notwith&s;tanding all their kindne&s;s, the <HI>Tartars</HI> would not a&s;&s;i&s;t them to retake <HI>Tayovan;</HI> &s;o that they only were content to build certain &s;mall Forts in the &s;mall I&s;lands adjoyning to <HI>Formo&s;a:</HI> and &s;ince my return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> I never could inform my &s;elf of the truth of the i&s;&s;ue of that Enterprize.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not content with their &s;ettlement at <HI>Firmando,</HI> which was an I&s;land both de&s;ert and barren, &s;eated upon a Streight,
<PB N="18" REF="488">
which &s;eparates the Point of the Land of <HI>Corea</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> a place no way commodious for their De&s;igns of Engro&s;&s;ing the Trade of <HI>China,</HI> as being too remote from <HI>Nangi&s;aqui:</HI> Be&s;ides, that the North and South Winds are &s;o violent at their Sea&s;ons in this Streight, between the two Coa&s;ts, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to come near the &s;hoar when they blow. The Pre&s;ident therefore having &s;uch good luck in the Expul&s;ion of the <HI>Portugals</HI> out of <HI>Japon,</HI> doubted not but that he might obtain the &s;mall I&s;land of <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> an I&s;land that had been wholly de&s;erted ever &s;ince the Habitations of the people had been de&s;troy'd. At fir&s;t he only de&s;ir'd leave to build a &s;mall Tenement for the conveniency of the Factors. Now between this I&s;land and <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> there is only a narrow Frith, not above a Musquet Shot over. Here the Pre&s;ident de&s;ir'd the Gover|nour that he might make a Bridge of Boats for a more ea&s;ie intercour&s;e between the City and the Port. The Governour gain'd by Pre&s;ents, gave him leave to build the Bridge; but &s;eeing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made an ill u&s;e of it, and that they came too frequently and numerou&s;ly into the City, he built two Forts at both ends of the Bridge, and furni&s;h'd them with Souldiers, who were to take notice who pa&s;s'd to and fro. He al&s;o publi&s;h'd an Order, That &s;uch <HI>Hollanders</HI> as came by day into the Town, &s;hould return to their Lodgings before night, upon pain of Death. This Order, and the little conveniency which they had for Lodging in their own Quarters, very much troubl'd them; &s;o that the Pre&s;ident made new Applications at Court, and obtain'd leave to build a Factory, and Warehou&s;es for their Goods.</P>
<P>The Governour thereupon &s;ent a Surveyor to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to mark out the Ground which the Emperour had given them to build upon. This per&s;on being largely rewarded, made them good mea&s;ure, and yet they were not contented; &s;o that in the Night-time they had enlarg'd their Quarters, by removing the fir&s;t marks. The Governour, being advertiz'd thereof, began to be very angry; but they found means to appea&s;e him with their Pre&s;ents: &s;o that he ea&s;ily conde&s;cended to the &s;light rea&s;ons which they gave him for what they had done. Thus in a &s;hort time they fini&s;h'd their work, which was without encompa&s;s'd with a Wall, much like a Garden Wall, but within contain'd a real Fort, flanck'd and lin'd according to all the Rules of Art; and which, the outward Wall being beaten down, not only defended their Bridge, but commanded the entry into the Haven of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui.</HI></P>
<P>They took great care not to admit any but <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for fear their De&s;ign &s;hould be di&s;cover'd. So that when the whole was fini&s;h'd, the Pre&s;ident gave advice to the General at <HI>Batavia</HI> what he had done, de&s;iring him to &s;end him eight Bra&s;s Guns, &s;o broken, as to be ea&s;ily put together in the places where they were broken. He adviz'd him al&s;o to put them up in Hog&s;heads, pack'd up like other Goods; and in&s;tead of Mariners, to &s;end a good number of Souldiers, habited like Mariners, for the &s;ecurity of the Factory. But this Stratagem had not that &s;ucce&s;s which he expected; for about that time the Emperour had &s;ent a new Governour to <HI>Nangi&s;aqui:</HI> So that when the Ships arriv'd at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the new chang'd Officers, being more vigilant then the for|mer, coming to weigh the Bales as they were put a&s;hore, and finding certain Hog&s;heads at the bottom of the hold, which they could not re|move by rea&s;on of their weight, they pre&s;ently brake them up, and perceiving there the broken pieces of Canons, carry'd &s;ome of them
<PB N="19" REF="488">
to the Governour, who immediately &s;ent intelligence thereof to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> of which the Pre&s;ident had as &s;uddain notice by his Pen&s;ioners. He having his invention at command, repairs forthwith to the Emperour's Court, and there tells the Emperour, That he had receiv'd Orders from his Superiours to pre&s;ent him with certain Peeces of Canon, made according to the newe&s;t Invention of his Country, the u&s;e whereof was &s;o convenient, that they were with little difficulty and trouble to be drawn up, and made u&s;e of, where others could not po&s;&s;ibly be brought to play: and that he thought no Pre&s;ent could be more acceptable or &s;er|viceable to him, to render him Victorious over his Enemies. Upon this the Emperour was very well &s;atisfi'd, and &s;ent to the Governour of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui</HI> to &s;end him tho&s;e Guns, and withall, not to mole&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> either in their Factory, or in vending their Wares.</P>
<P>Having &s;o fortunately di&s;engag'd him&s;elf out of the&s;e Briers, he lays another de&s;ign, and &s;ends to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> a per&s;on of a turbulent and unquiet Spirit like him&s;elf, to &s;et out two Ve&s;&s;els, to make a di&s;covery of all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Japon,</HI> and particularly of tho&s;e Coa&s;ts which were next the Gold Mines, and to &s;ee if they could find any &s;afe Harbour for Ships to ride in, in tho&s;e tempe&s;tuous Seas, or any places proper to fortifie, that they might no longer depend upon the uncertain humour of the Court of <HI>Japon,</HI> which was as incon&s;tant as their Seas. The General provided two Ships, and furni&s;h'd them with excellent Pilots, good Souldiers, expert Mariners, and Provi&s;ions for two years, with all other Nece&s;&s;aries and In&s;truments, as well for del|ving as building. One of the &s;even of the General's Council was chos'n Supervi&s;or of the Enterprize. 'Tis &s;aid, that tho&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els skirted all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Japon,</HI> from the Ea&s;t to the South, and from the South to the North, fetching a compa&s;s about the I&s;lands to the 47 <HI>deg.</HI> of Northern Latitude, and that they di&s;cover'd one I&s;lands which they call'd <HI>The States I&s;land,</HI> and afterwards touch'd upon another Land which they nam'd <HI>The Company's Land,</HI> inhabited by White people, with long Hair, habited after the <HI>Japon</HI> fa&s;hion, which they found to be a Continent adjoyning to <HI>Niulhan,</HI> and <HI>Corea;</HI> and that after they had wander'd a long time upon the Sea, without any other de&s;ign then to make new Di&s;coveries, they pa&s;s'd through the Streights of <HI>Sanguar,</HI> which &s;eparates the Land of <HI>Ye&s;&s;o</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> and kept along tho&s;e Coa&s;ts of <HI>Japon</HI> to the Ea&s;t, to ob&s;erve the Bays of <HI>Aizu,</HI> and <HI>Xendai,</HI> where are the Gold Mines. In that part a furious Tempe&s;t took them, in &s;ight of the Mountains, where the Gold Mines lye, which la&s;ted four days together. The &s;econd of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els run full again&s;t a Rock, and &s;plit her &s;elf, with the total lo&s;s of every Mothers Son in the Ve&s;&s;el. The Admiral held out a longer time, but coa&s;ting the Land where the Mountains of <HI>Sataque</HI> appear, the Tempe&s;t grew &s;o violent, that &s;he al&s;o brake again&s;t the Rocks. In this &s;econd Ship|wrack only the Admiral, and thirteen per&s;ons more e&s;cap'd, partly by the help of the Planks, and partly by Swiming. The <HI>Japonners</HI> upon the Coa&s;t pre&s;ently ran to view them, and wonder'd to &s;ee people in tho&s;e parts, who&s;e Language they did not under&s;tand. Neverthele&s;s, they entertain'd them civilly enough; but in regard they were Stran|gers, and that there was a &s;trict prohibition not to receive any Stran|gers among them upon any pretence what&s;oever, they were at a great lo&s;s what to do with 'em&punc; One, wi&s;er then the re&s;t, advis'd his

Brethren to carry them to the Emperour, who&s;e coun&s;el was follow'd; and &s;o they took their journey toward <HI>Yeddo,</HI> which was above a hun|dred Leagues off.</P>
<P>The Emperour, being inform'd of their arrival, order'd that they &s;hould be civilly us'd; and at the end of eight days &s;ent for them, and caus'd them to be ask'd, of what Country they were, and what De&s;ign brought them into his Seas? The Admiral, who was a per&s;on of a ready ingenuity, an&s;wer'd, That he was a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who all his life time had &s;erv'd his Country as a Souldier, where he had the command of a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Foot, at what time Fortune, or rather the care of pre&s;erving his Honour, forc'd him from his Native Soyl. I was, &s;aid he, one of the chief Commanders in the Army, and though I &s;ay it, my Service had gain'd me a fair reputation. The Prince, who commanded us, had a great confidence in me, which made one of his near Relations jealous of me; &s;o that he was not only content to do me all ill Offices with the General, but &s;ought all occa|&s;ions to pick a quarrel with me. I dare be bold to &s;ay, that had he not been &s;o nearly related to the Prince, I &s;hould not have taken his affronts &s;o long patiently. But at length he provok'd that patience to &s;uch a degree, and &s;o deeply and openly affronted me, that I was con&s;train'd to meet him with my Sword in my hand. His misfortune and mine &s;o order'd it, that I kill'd him at the fir&s;t pu&s;h. My Friends a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to make my e&s;cape, and kept me hid for &s;ome days, thinking to have ap|peas'd the Princes anger; but it continu'd &s;o violent, that they advis'd me to ab&s;ent my &s;elf for &s;ome years. Therefore to render my Exile le&s;s tedious, and that I might be &s;till doing &s;omething for the Service of my Country, I de&s;ir'd my Friends to furni&s;h me with two Ships, with a re&s;olution to &s;eek out and de&s;troy all tho&s;e Pirates that infe&s;ted the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas. I have been in chace of them for a whole year together; and &s;ometimes we met with Tempe&s;ts &s;o violent, that drave us we know not whither our &s;elves, my Pilots not being experienc'd in the Ea&s;tern Seas. Soon after meeting with another Tempe&s;t no le&s;s rude and boy&s;trous, we were forc'd to let our Ships drive as the Winds them&s;elves were pleas'd to force them, which at length drove us upon the Coa&s;ts of this Empire, where we have &s;uffer'd Shipwrack, not having &s;av'd above fourteen of four hundred, which I brought along with me. Happy in &s;uch a misfortune, to be ca&s;t upon the Territories of a Prince &s;o potent and generous, that, no que&s;tion, will have compa&s;&s;ion upon our mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had repeated this Relation to the Emperour, the Prince, and all the Lords of the Court were very much concern'd, and admir'd both the Courage and A&s;pect of the Stranger. The Emperour &s;ent him very rich Pre&s;ents, and to all tho&s;e of his Company; and gave Order, that he &s;hould be conducted to <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> to the <HI>Holland</HI> Factory, and that he &s;hould be well treated upon the way, during the whole journey, which was five and twenty or thirty days Travel. There this famous Champion &s;tay'd four Months, in expectation of the Ships that come every year from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japon;</HI> &s;o that he had time enough to make a full Relation of the Lands which he had ob&s;erv'd, and of all the particulars of the Shipwrack. One day as he was telling how he had cajoll'd the Emperour, and that the Pre&s;ident was applauding the quick|ne&s;s of his wit for inventing &s;uch an imaginary piece of Knight-Errantry,
<PB N="21" REF="489">
a <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Boy that &s;erv'd the Pre&s;ident, heard all the di&s;|cour&s;e, without being ob&s;erv'd by his Ma&s;ter. Some Months after, the Pre&s;ident had beaten this Boy, which he, as all the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> are of a fiery and vindicative Nature, re&s;olving to revenge, went to the Governour of <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> and repeated to him the whole Di&s;cour&s;e between his Ma&s;ter and the Admiral. The Governour, finding it to be a bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, &s;ends advice thereof to the Court. The Emperour was &s;o enrag'd at the injury and affront put upon him, that he commanded the Governour to &s;top the Admiral and his Train, and to &s;end him with a good Guard to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and not to let any Ship enter the Harbour, 'till he had had a full Examination of the matter.</P>
<P>This Order was not &s;o &s;ecret, but that the Pre&s;idents Friends had notice thereof, who pre&s;ently gave him intelligence of it &s;o &s;ea&s;onably, that the Admiral was &s;ent a way before the Order came to the Governour. Eight days after, three <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els arriv'd at <HI>Ki&s;ma,</HI> to whom the Governour &s;ent expre&s;s command to keep out at Sea, and not to come a&s;hore. The Pre&s;ident feigning to be &s;urpriz'd at this Prohibition, went to the Governour to know the rea&s;on, who gave him this An&s;wer, The Emperour, &s;aid he, is acquainted with your tricks, you &s;hall have no more kindne&s;s from me; I have &s;ent to Court to give notice of the arrival of your three Ships, and I &s;hall follow my Orders when they come. Upon this the Pre&s;ident made no doubt but the Admiral's &s;tory was di&s;cover'd; and recollecting with him&s;elf that he had beaten his <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Boy, and that he was run away from him, he &s;oon conjectur'd at the Author of all the mi&s;chief. In &s;hort, the Governour receives his Orders, the Tenour whereof was, That he &s;hould &s;end away the three Ve&s;&s;els, without permitting them to land either Men or Goods; and that he &s;hould tell the Pre&s;ident. That the Emperour was &s;atisfi'd that the Admiral was a Cheat and a Spy, whom he intended to puni&s;h &s;everely; and therefore, if he did not &s;end for him to <HI>Japon</HI> by the fir&s;t opportunity of the Winds, he would put to Death all tho&s;e of his Nation, and fling their Goods into the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon the return of three Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there was no &s;mall hurly burly in the I&s;land; for by them they under&s;tood the danger that their Country-men were in, if they did not &s;end back the Admiral. There|upon an extraordinary Council was call'd, to deliberate upon an affair of &s;o great importance, who were all of one mind, that the Admi|ral was to be &s;ent back, and that it was better for one to &s;uffer, then a whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Admiral being advertiz'd of this their re&s;olution, publickly pro|te&s;ted again&s;t the violence and inju&s;tice they were about to do him; telling them, that he was born a Subject of the Republick of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had only the Power of his life and death; that in their Service, he would expo&s;e his life to a thou&s;and hazards, but that he was not oblig'd to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for the particular Intere&s;ts of a private Trade. The Mini&s;ters took his part, and made it a ca&s;e in Religion. The common people mutiny'd again&s;t the General, and the Tumult grew to that heat, that the Sea-men were &s;ent for from aboard their Ships to di&s;per&s;e the multitude. At length, by the interpo&s;ition of a Mini&s;ter, the bu&s;ine&s;s was brought to a conclu&s;ion; who per&s;waded the Admiral by his &s;mooth Language, to appea&s;e the di&s;order of the people, by &s;ubmitting to the Re&s;ult of the Council. Thereupon he
 
<PB N="22" REF="490">
promis'd to return to <HI>Japon,</HI> propvided they would allow him what he demanded, not only for his reward, but al&s;o that which &s;hould bear him out in that &s;ame new part which he had in his head to act.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he demanded two Ships magnificently trim'd, a Train of fifty cho&s;en Men, every one of which was to have three changes of Habit, of the riche&s;t Stuffs that could be had: Moreover 50000 Crowns for his Voyage, a Cupboard of Gold and Silver Plate, with all Equipage proportionable, and that tho&s;e that accompany'd him &s;hould re&s;pect him, as a per&s;on of great Quality.</P>
<P>All this was allow'd him, and the Admiral departed from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and arriv'd well at <HI>Nangi&s;aqui.</HI> The Governour &s;urpriz'd at the beauty of the Ve&s;&s;els, could not believe them to be Merchants, and therefore &s;ent to know who they were; but he was more &s;urpriz'd when he knew that it was the Admiral. Forthwith he di&s;patch'd a Courrier to the Em|perour, to give him notice, and to inform him with what magnificence the Admiral was return'd. The Pre&s;ident al&s;o &s;ent, that he might have a favourable reception, and to de&s;ire his Friends to let the Emperour know, that this was a Per&s;on of great Quality, whom an Honourable Action had driven from his Country, and that he no &s;ooner under&s;tood the accu&s;ation that lay again&s;t him, but that he was return'd with that Equipage that became him, to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Till the Order came, the Governour, according to cu&s;tom, caus'd all the Sails and Rudders of the Ships to be brought to him, not per|mitting any per&s;on to come a&s;hore. At length the Order came, that the Admiral and his Attendants &s;hould be receiv'd into the City, toge|ther with all things nece&s;&s;ary for their per&s;ons, and that they &s;hould be convoy'd to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and that in all places where they came, they &s;hould be nobly treated. The Pre&s;ident accompany'd the Admiral to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, as well with his Councils, as with the favour of his Friends. Their Entry was very magnificent, and the richne&s;s of their Habits brought the people from all parts, as being mainly greedy after No|velty, &s;o that the noi&s;e thereof was &s;pread all over the Court: Yet the Emperour would not admit them to their Audience upon the day which they de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>Two Months were elaps'd, during which time the Admiral kept open Table, and di&s;play'd his da&s;ling Riches to the Eyes of the <HI>Japone&s;es,</HI> and being of a quick and apprehen&s;ive wit, he caus'd him&s;elf to be in|&s;tructed in the Language of the I&s;land, and in a &s;hort time he began to un|der&s;tand many Words. When the Emperour &s;ent for him, he clad him&s;elf and his Train in a richer Habit then that which they had on when he made his Entry. At fir&s;t the Emperour &s;eem'd to be angry; I under&s;tand, &s;aid he, that thou art an Impo&s;tor and a Traytor, that thy Birth is ob&s;cure, and that thou art come as a &s;py into my Kingdom, and therefore I am re&s;olv'd to puni&s;h thee according to thy merits.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had explain'd the Emperour's words, the Admiral with an undaunted countenance, Sir, &s;aid he, a Prince &s;o great as you are, &s;hould rather be a comfort and &s;upport to the unfortu|nate, then add to their affliction. Fortune, that per&s;ecutes me, has in nothing been more cruel to me, then in rai&s;ing tho&s;e Calumnies, with which &s;he has endeavour'd to blemi&s;h my reputation with your Ma|je&s;ty. She might expell me my Country, and ca&s;t me upon unknown Coa&s;ts at the other end of the World&punc; but &s;he can never in&s;pire into
<PB N="23" REF="490">
me thoughts unworthy of my Birth. This is the &s;econd time I have been within your Dominions, the fir&s;t by occa&s;ion of Shipwrack, the &s;econd to obey your Maje&s;ties commands. The fir&s;t accu&s;es none but the Winds. And had I been guilty of what I am accus'd, I &s;hould never have ventur'd my &s;elf into your hands &s;o far off from your Power. But, Sir, my Accu&s;ers have one advantage which I have not; they &s;peak your Language, I under&s;tand it not, nor how to make you apprehend the truth of my ju&s;tification. Allow me eight Months to learn the Speech of your Country, and then, if you will be &s;o gratious as to hear me, I make no doubt but to confound my Accu&s;ers, and to &s;atisfie your Maje&s;ty in all things.</P>
<P>The Emperour was &s;urpriz'd, and mov'd with his An&s;wer, but more e&s;pecially at his reque&s;t of eight Months to learn the <HI>Japonick</HI> Language. I grant it thee, &s;aid the Emperour, for it is but ju&s;t that a per&s;on ac|cus'd &s;hould have both the Liberty and means to do it. And in the mean time I will take care that thou be honourably entertain'd in all places where thou ha&s;t a de&s;ire to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Admiral us&punc;d this Liberty with &s;o much prudence, and got &s;o much the love of the Courtiers by his carriage and his liberality, that by their conver&s;e, he not only learnt the Language, but by vertue of their good Character, the Emperour would often &s;end for him, and ask him &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning our <HI>Europe,</HI> in reference to the Qualities of the Countries, the Manners of the People, the &s;everal Forms of Government, the Extent of the &s;everal Kingdoms, their Riches, Strength, and War-like Di&s;cipline; of all which, the Admi|ral gave him &s;o hand&s;ome an Accompt, that the Prince took great de|light in his Di&s;cour&s;e. And at length he had gain'd &s;o much the favour and confidence of the Emperour, that he utterly laid a&s;ide all the ill thoughts which he had of him, and condemn'd to Death, as a fal&s;e Witne&s;s, and a Traducer, the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> that had accus'd him.</P>
<P>After &s;o fortunate an e&s;cape, the Admiral thought it but common prudence to make a fair retreat in the Grandeur of his Reputation, and thereupon he took leave of the Emperour, who loaded him with Honours and Pre&s;ents. The Courtiers were al&s;o &s;orry for his departure, &s;o that &s;ome of them accompany'd him back, and took order for his entertain|ment, which was very magnificent all the way to <HI>Nangi&s;aqui,</HI> where he took Shipping a few days after, and return'd to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>All the People throng'd to the Port to &s;ee him when he Landed. He told them in few words the &s;ucce&s;s of his Voyage. Some applauded his ingenuity and courage; others extoll'd the Service which he had done the Company and Nation. The Council receiv'd him al&s;o with thanks and prai&s;es, and gave him all the Gold and Plate which he had brought back. A while after he departed for <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where he was no &s;ooner arriv'd, but he pre&s;ented a Petition to the States General again&s;t the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, for &s;ending him back to <HI>Japon,</HI> and for reparation of the violence and injury done him. The bu&s;ine&s;s was long in debate, but at la&s;t the Company was condemn'd to pay him great damages, and Intere&s;t for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But to return to the Pre&s;ident: He began now to be weary of being confin'd to one Factory, though he made up his Pack well enough where he was. But his Ambition carry'd him farther, and he thought he had done Service enough to be advanc'd to a higher Dignity. Nei|ther

was his pre&s;ence &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at <HI>Japon,</HI> where he had &s;ettl'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade in as good a condition as it could well be. And in truth, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had then almo&s;t the whole Trade of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> They had taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h, Formo&s;a, Amboyna,</HI> and <HI>Pooleron,</HI> and by that means engro&s;s'd all the Trade of Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs. They had taken <HI>Baton</HI> by &s;urprize. The Inhabitants of the <HI>Celebes, Ternate,</HI> and <HI>Tidor,</HI> were become their Va&s;&s;als; and the King of <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ar</HI> having made an Alliance with them, had expell'd the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> out of his Dominions. By means of their Factories in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> they had got all the Pepper Trade of the We&s;tern-Coa&s;t of that I&s;land into their hands, be&s;ides &s;everal other advantages which they had in &s;everal other places, where they had encroach'd upon the <HI>Portugals, Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> them&s;elves. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at that time enter|tain'd 140 Ships, part Men of War, and part Merchant-men, pro|vided with great Guns, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ion of all &s;orts, and in the&s;e Ships above 6000 Men, part Souldiers, part Mariners. <HI>Bata|via</HI> was the Soul of their Conque&s;ts, made upon the Ruins of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es,</HI> which had they lain all together, would have made a large Empire, and by which they might have grown infinitely rich, had not the expences of their Navies and Souldiers eaten out the gains of their va&s;t Trade. One of their wi&s;e&s;t Generals told me frequently, <HI>We have,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but too many Fortre&s;&s;es, we need no more then the</HI> Cape of Good Hope, <HI>and</HI> Batavia, <HI>Factories well &s;ettl'd, good Ships, and hone&s;t Men to &s;erve us.</HI> For in &s;hort, their Officers pillage unmercifully, and cau&s;e the Commerce and Dominion of their Country-men to be dete&s;ted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> through their <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>I know my &s;elf, that in the year 1664, the Expences of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> amounted, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> to twelve Millions a year, not to reckon Shipwracks, decay of Ships, and wa&s;t of Goods, and yet their Cargo's for <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> have not amounted to above ten Millions; and &s;ometimes the Cargo's are &s;o mean, that the Receits do not an&s;wer the Expences. Neverthele&s;s their per&s;everance and courage were worthy of admiration. For what could be more to be admir'd, then to &s;ee that a &s;mall number of Merchants, a&s;&s;embled at fir&s;t upon the &s;ingle &s;core of Trade, &s;hould afterwards pre&s;ume to make War in Regions &s;o far di&s;tant, a&s;&s;ail &s;o many Princes and Nations, plant &s;o many Colonies, be&s;iege &s;o many Cities and Forts, and la&s;tly, &s;et forth &s;o many Navies at &s;uch prodigious Expences, that it would put many potent Soveraigns to a plunge to do as they did?</P>
<P>This was the E&s;tate of the <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, at what time the Pre&s;ident, the principal Subject of this Relation, was recall'd from <HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there to take upon him the Office of <HI>Chief Director.</HI> He carry'd thither great &s;tore of Wealth, and built &s;everal magnificent Hou&s;es in the City. His Authority al&s;o was very large; but he exer|cis'd it according to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, and was hated by all the Officers of the Company, and the Citizens them&s;elves. He thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of the Employment of General, but he was deceiv'd in his hopes; upon which he took pet, and return'd for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where he liv'd quietly for &s;ome years. At length his turbulent and ambitious Spirit put him upon new De&s;igns, to revenge the injury which he thought he had receiv'd. To which purpo&s;e he return'd to the <HI>Indies.</HI> His undertaking was not &s;o pro&s;perous for tho&s;e that employ'd him, and who merited to

<P>_IN the Relation which I have undertaken, I &s;hall make a faithful Report of things in &s;uch manner as I &s;aw them tran&s;acted by the Deputies &s;ent to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well on the behalf of the King, as of the <HI>French</HI> Company, for the &s;ettlement of Trade.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth of <HI>July,</HI> 1665. the Sieur <HI>Lalin,</HI> Gentleman in Extraordinary to the King, and the Sieur <HI>de la Boulaye,</HI> a Centleman of <HI>Anjou,</HI> with the Sieurs <HI>Beber, Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont,</HI> Deputies of the new <HI>French</HI> Company, for the &s;ettling of Trade in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and took up their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> being the Suburbs of the &s;ame City, where al&s;o at that time liv'd the Sieur <HI>L' E&s;toile,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Merchant. <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Boulaye,</HI> without &s;aying any thing to the Deputies, deliver'd to <HI>L' E&s;toile</HI> the Letters which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lyonne</HI> had written to him; the In&s;crip|tion whereof was thus. <HI>To Mr.</HI> L' E&s;toile, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Valet du Chambre <HI>to the King of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>or in his ab&s;ence, to Mr.</HI> Logis, <HI>his Son in Law.</HI> Which was not a little to be admir'd at by the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had &s;ojourn'd any time in that Country, to find that Mon&s;ier <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who had been be|fore in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;hould have better under&s;tood the Cu&s;tom of the Court, &s;hould be no better able to in&s;truct a Secretary of State, then to let him give <HI>L' E&s;toile</HI> the Title of <HI>Valet du Chambre</HI> to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="492">
who has none to &s;erve him in his Chamber but Eunuchs, and never &s;uffers a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to touch his Habits, for fear of being defil'd.</P>
<P>The purport of the Letters, was to admoni&s;h <HI>L' E&s;toile</HI> to &s;upport, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and protect the Deputies in the Bu&s;ine&s;s upon which the Com|pany had &s;ent them; and in ca&s;e of lo&s;&s;es by the way, to furni&s;h them with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they &s;hould want.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was then three days journey from <HI>I&s;pahan;</HI> for which rea&s;on a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patch'd with a Letter to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> or Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and another to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> or his Lieutenant, to know whether his Maje&s;ty would command them to wait on him there, or whether they &s;hould expect his return to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the Deputies could not agree among&s;t them&s;elves: For the three Merchants <HI>Beber, Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont</HI> affirm'd, that the two Gentlemen were only intere&s;ted by the by in this Negotiation; and that having no right to take cognizance of the Affairs of the Com|pany, they ought not to trouble them&s;elves any farther, then the King's Letters directed them, in the affairs of the Company. That the Effect of the King's Letters was no more, then that two Gentlemen, de&s;irous to &s;ee the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were joyn'd with the Deputies of the Com|pany; and therefore it belong'd to them only to treat with the Mini&s;ters of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That the Gentlemen had no more to do then to deliver the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, and to de&s;ire a nomination of Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Deputies. This con|te&s;t, which all the <HI>Franks</HI> in vain endeavour'd to compo&s;e, came at length to the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Ears; who was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd at it, having then a de&s;ign to procure an Order from the King to remove out of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and the Suburbs, all the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of what opinion &s;oever, and place them over again&s;t <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Deputies rais'd new objections and difficulties every day; which Father <HI>Raphael</HI> of <HI>Mans,</HI> Superiour of the Order of <HI>Capu|chins</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> employ'd all his credit and indu&s;try to accommodate. He wrote them out &s;everal forms of a Letter, which they were to &s;end to the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but tho&s;e that pleas'd the one Party, did not like the other. At length Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> weary of &s;cribling and altering, amending and correcting, and all to no purpo&s;e; told them &s;eriou&s;ly, they did ill to act in &s;uch a manner, and to in&s;i&s;t upon idle formalities; that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Style, wherein they ought to write to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> ought to be conci&s;e and plain, without &s;uperfluities, or impertinencies; and la&s;tly, that all their contentions did but redound to the di&s;advantage of the Com|pany, who&s;e Intere&s;ts they pretended to manage. After &s;everal con|te&s;ts, Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> at la&s;t, fini&s;h'd the Letter to the content of both Parties, which was tran&s;crib'd into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; with ano|ther to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> and both were di&s;patch'd away. The <HI>Nazar</HI> having read it, pre&s;ently inform'd the King of the <HI>French</HI> Companies de&s;ign, and of the arrival of the Deputies. His Maje&s;ty commanded him to let them know that they were welcome, and that in a &s;hort time, he would return to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and give them Audience.</P>
<P>Some few dayes after, the Court return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and while the King &s;topp'd at one of his Hou&s;es near the Gates of the City, the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent for Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to know of him who the <HI>French</HI> Deputies were, and who had &s;ent them into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to which the Father gave him the be&s;t &s;atisfaction he could. For the <HI>Nazar</HI> wonder'd that they were
<PB N="28" REF="493">
come into the Kingdom, and &s;ent, as they &s;aid, from &s;uch a potent Prince, and yet that the Governours of <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris</HI> &s;hould know nothing of their pa&s;&s;age through tho&s;e Cities. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> al&s;o was in the &s;ame A&s;toni&s;hment; and it gave them rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect both the Quality of their Per&s;ons, and the Reality of their Commi&s;&s;ion. For either they were ignorant of the cu&s;tom of the Country, or el&s;e they did ill to travel <HI>incognito,</HI> like ordinary Trade&s;men, and Per&s;ons of mean condition. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> having a&s;&s;ur'd them, that they were &s;ent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to &s;ettle a Company of Trade, and that he had Letters of Advice thereof out of <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Nazar</HI> bid Father <HI>Raphael</HI> tell the Deputies they &s;hould be in a readine&s;s, for that the King would give them Audience in a few days.</P>
<P>But the former mi&s;under&s;tanding, &s;till continuing between the Gen|tlemen and Deputies, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fearing &s;ome mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quence of it in the pre&s;ence of the King, or that they &s;hould make &s;ome di&s;pute for priority, the Father repre&s;ented to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that whereas the Deptuies were of two Orders, the one of Gentlemen, and the other of Merchants; therefore to take away all &s;u&s;pition of jealou&s;ie, it would do well, that His Maje&s;ty would be pleas'd when he admitted them to their Audience, to permit the Gentlemen their &s;eats on the one &s;ide, and the Merchants on the other. Which the <HI>Nazar</HI> approv'd, and the King allow'd of the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The 27^t^h of <HI>September,</HI> the King being at his Palace of <HI>Scader-Abbas,</HI> upon the bank of the River, between the Bridge of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and the Bridge of <HI>Schiras,</HI> caus'd a preparation of Artificial Fire-works to be made, which came to above 2000 <HI>l.</HI> and early in the Morning caus'd notice to be given, that he intended that day to give audience to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Deputies. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> al&s;o had Order to be ready with the Deputies, to the end, the <HI>Mehemender,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, might not be oblig'd to wait. Accordingly that very day the <HI>Mehemender</HI> came to <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and from thence con|ducted the Deputies, with all their Train, and the re&s;t of the Franks then re&s;ident in tho&s;e parts all mounted on Hor&s;e-back, with a march &s;o &s;low and grave, and for the advantage of the &s;ight &s;o far about, that it was almo&s;t Night before they arriv'd at <HI>Scader-Abbas;</HI> at what time the <HI>Mehemender</HI> enter'd the Palace alone, leaving the Merchants at the Door. In the mean while, the Merchants believing that Father <HI>Raphael</HI> did not favour them &s;o much as the Gentlemen, cry'd out aloud, that they would have an Interpreter al&s;o for them&s;elves, or el&s;e would go no farther. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> who acted only by the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Order, and for the advantage of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, told them, that whither they went any farther or no it was all one to him: that for his part he was not there as an Interpreter, either for the one or the other, but only in obedience to the King's commands.</P>
<P>In the mid'&s;t of this debate the <HI>Mehemender</HI> return'd to carry the De|puties to their Audience; five hundred Musketeers being rank'd in order upon the bank of the River, to give them a Volley as they pa&s;s'd along. The <HI>Mehemender</HI>'s march at fir&s;t was &s;low and grave, but approaching the place where the King was, and from whence he had a view of the De|puties, he caus'd them to double their pace to the foot of the Steps, where the Lackeys took off their Shooes; and from thence they proceeded into the Hall of Audience, where the <HI>Kans,</HI> and other great Lords were
<PB N="29" REF="493">
&s;itting. Upon each &s;ide &s;tood the Youth of Quality, &s;umptou&s;ly clad in Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold and Silver, their Cloaks and Mantles being lin'd with Martins, Sables, and other rich Furs. The Deputies being come into the King's pre&s;ence, the <HI>Mehemender</HI> caus'd them to kneel, and bow their Heads to the Ground three times: That done, he caus'd them to ri&s;e, and lead up <HI>Lalin</HI> by the hand alone, as being the per&s;on who had in charge the pre&s;enting of the Letter to the King. After him follow'd <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Deputies, and thus they mounted up to the place where fate the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> and the <HI>Nazar.</HI> The King was &s;eated upon a Scaffold &s;ome what higher then the re&s;t, encom|pas'd with 150 young Gentlemen magnificently clad, to whom the <HI>Sieur Lalin,</HI> at the head of the Deputies, made his compliments in <HI>French,</HI> and then humbly pre&s;ented the Kings Letter, &s;eal'd with a flat Seal upon a flying <HI>Label,</HI> enclos'd in an Embroider'd Box, with the Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> in relief, upon the Lid. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> explain'd to the King the effect of <HI>Lalin</HI>'s Speech. After which the King gave a little bow with his Head, and at the &s;ame time gave a &s;ign to the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies to carry them back to their places. Being come to the bottom of the Hall, where the Officers had Order to &s;eparate the Gentlemen from the Merchants, the Officers by mi&s;take put <HI>Boulaye</HI> with two of the Merchants, and <HI>Mariage</HI> one of the Mer|chants with <HI>Lalin,</HI> which made <HI>Boulaye</HI> cry out aloud in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage <HI>Menbeg-Zadd&egrave;,</HI> I am a Gentleman; but the thing being done, and the King being pre&s;ent, there was no help. Then the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Mu&s;ick began to play for a quarter of an Hour; which having given over, the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies came again, and carried up Father <HI>Ra|phael,</HI> and the two Gentlemen, as he &s;uppos'd, of which <HI>Mariage</HI> by the forementioned mi&s;take happen'd to be one, again to the King: at what time <HI>Lalin</HI> with a comely grace made his Harangue, and &s;et forth the occa&s;ion of his Deputation of His Maje&s;ty, of which His Maje&s;ty te&s;tifi'd his good liking by a nod of his Head. For <HI>Lalin</HI> had a hand&s;om pre&s;ence, and &s;pake with an acceptable Tone, and his magnificent Habit very much added to the comely Air of his Per&s;on. The Speech was expounded by Father <HI>Raphael;</HI> which when he had done, the King ask'd the Deputies &s;everal Que&s;tions, and then with his hand made them a &s;ign to retire to their places, beck'ning at the &s;ame time to Father <HI>Ra|phael</HI> to &s;tay; and cau&s;ing him to come near him, more particularly in|form'd him&s;elf of the Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Extent of his Dominions, his Military Di&s;cipline, and his Councils: of all which the Father gave him the be&s;t accompt he could, and then with the King's leave, retir'd to his place. This Scene being over, a Flagon of Gold, and a Gla&s;s were &s;ent to the Deputies, attended with a &s;hort Banquet of Fruits, and other &s;orts of Food; the In&s;trumental and Vocal Mu&s;ick playing all the while. Which being over, the King again &s;ent for <HI>Lalin, Mariage,</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and after a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, having di&s;mi&s;s'd all but father <HI>Raphael,</HI> he fell into a di&s;pute with him touching the Unity of the Divine Nature, the nece&s;&s;ity of one Prophet, and how <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the Seal and Crown of all Prophets. He &s;eem'd to admire that the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had the Reputation of being People of Wit and Di&s;cretion, could think <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be a God: to all which parti|culars, the Father endeavour'd to give the King the be&s;t &s;atisfaction he could. But then, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being de&s;irous that the three Deputies
<PB N="30" REF="494">
&s;hould partake of the King's favour as the other two had done. Where|upon the King &s;ent for the other three Deputies, and having di&s;cours'd a while with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> while Father <HI>Raphael</HI> interpreted between them, in a &s;hort while he di&s;mi&s;s'd them all again, but Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> with whom he enter'd into a more jocular Di&s;cour&s;e then the former, of the Colours, Black and White, and of the Beauty of the <HI>French</HI> Women, the King confe&s;&s;ing that naturally he did not love Brown Women, the White complection being more agreeable to him, as being that com|plexion which alone compos'd the Beauty of Women. The Father mode&s;tly made his an&s;wer, that Beauty con&s;i&s;ted only in fancy; for that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> lov'd thick and full Eyebrows, which were not at all e&s;teem'd in <HI>France.</HI> Then the King ca&s;ting his Eyes upon the Box wherein the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter lay, he took out the Letter, and ob&s;erving it to be a &s;mall piece of Parchment, and not &s;uch a one as he had receiv'd from &s;everal Princes and Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> nor indeed like tho&s;e which the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had brought him formerly from the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf, in a fair piece of Parchment, with a large Seal deep cut, he gave evident Demon&s;trations of his contempt of it, and was about to have thrown it away. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> perceiv'd him to be out of humour, to whom the King in pur&s;uance of his di&s;like, &s;aid, <HI>Ra|phael,</HI> I never receive open Letters without a Seal, take it, and let me &s;ee it no more, for I do not believe it comes from &s;o great a King as the King of <HI>France,</HI> and at the &s;ame time made him a &s;ign to retire. He dur&s;t do no otherwi&s;e then take the Letter, and &s;o returning to his place, he told both <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> what had pa&s;s'd in his Di&s;cour&s;e be|tween him and the King. Two hours, after that, were &s;pent in be|holding the <HI>Mummeries</HI> of their common Dancers, a pa&s;time very u&s;ual in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Which being over, the King &s;ent again for <HI>Lalin, Mariage,</HI> and the Father; and after &s;ome few Que&s;tions, to which they gave the be&s;t An&s;wers they could, he again di&s;mi&s;s'd both the Deputies, retaining only Father <HI>Raphael</HI> with him. The Father, then taking his opportunity, told the King, that he had always ob&s;erv'd it to be the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> to cau&s;e the Letters, which the <HI>European</HI> Princes &s;ent His Maje&s;ty, to be interpreted in his pre&s;ence. And therefore, added the Father, I be&s;eech Your Maje&s;ty to permit me to give the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to the end, it may be truly interpreted to him according to u&s;ual cu&s;tom. Thereupon the King made a &s;ign to the Father to give it him, and glad he was to be &s;o rid of it. The Father ob&s;erving the King in a good humour, &s;poke to him in behalf of the other three Deputies, that he would be pleas'd to admit them to be &s;ent for a &s;econd time, in regard the others had been &s;ent for three times. But the King told him, it was enough for him to &s;peak to the Gentlemen, let his Mini&s;ters talk with the Merchants. The Father being then di&s;mi&s;s'd, he &s;ent for <HI>Lalin</HI> alone, for whom he &s;hew'd him&s;elf to have a very great kindne&s;s and affection; and at the &s;ame time commanded the <HI>Nazar</HI> to bring him the next day, together with Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Lagis</HI> the <HI>Geneve&s;e,</HI> who was retain'd in his Service, to Court, for that he intended to be merry with them. Then he went on, and told <HI>Lalin,</HI> that &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>French</HI> Ships were arriv'd, he would &s;end an Emba&s;&s;adour to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and make a &s;trict Alliance with him. <HI>Lalin</HI> reply'd, that His Maje&s;ty of <HI>France</HI> de&s;ir'd nothing more. Why then, reply'd the King, is not my Alliance &s;uffi|cient,
<PB N="31" REF="494">
but that you mu&s;t go &s;eek the Alliance of the Blacks, from whom you will not draw tho&s;e advantages, with which you flatter your &s;elves? For you mu&s;t know, that the Deputies kept their affairs &s;o &s;ecret, that no body knew of them but all the World, the Servants as well as the Ma&s;ters. Not con&s;idering, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are good Poli|ticians, and that that Court is never without Spies. Therefore the King knew, that as &s;oon as the Deputies had di&s;patch'd at his Court, they were to depart for the <HI>Indies,</HI> with which Nation he keeps no good Corre&s;pondence. And for that rea&s;on, he was not a little offended with them, though they endeavour'd to per&s;uade him, that their Errand to the <HI>Indies</HI> was only for Linnen and Spices.</P>
<P>The Deputies pre&s;ented to the King a very fair <HI>Fuzee,</HI> together with the Kings Picture, in little, drawn to the Life, which was &s;o much the more e&s;teem'd, becau&s;e at the &s;ame time &s;everal large Cuts had been brought to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and pre&s;ented to the King, which perfectly agreed with the Picture in Oyl, by which the whole Court was convinc'd that it was the real Portraiture of the King. When the&s;e Pre&s;ents were laid before the King, he ask'd the Deputies, for which of the Ea&s;tern Na|tions the <HI>French</HI> had mo&s;t affection; to whom M. <HI>Lalin</HI> made an&s;wer, that certainly for the <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> thereupon the King return'd, that cer|tainly they had rea&s;on; for that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were white, like the <HI>French,</HI> and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to have any affection for the <HI>Indians</HI> who were black.</P>
<P>At length the King, to &s;hew the Deputies his highe&s;t favour, would have them drink the <HI>HEZARD PICHE,</HI> in a golden Cup, which holds about a Pint of <HI>Paris.</HI> He order'd the Wine to be the &s;ame which he drank him&s;elf, which was in a Bottle of Chry&s;tal Gla&s;s, &s;tudded with Diamonds. <HI>Lalin</HI> drank couragiou&s;ly, and &s;o did <HI>Mariage;</HI> but Father <HI>Raphael</HI> made a fair excu&s;e, and got off. After midnight the <HI>Zerhaftes,</HI> or Table-Cloaths of Cloth of Gold were &s;pread upon the Floor, and &s;everal roa&s;ted Viands very hot of the Spice, and Di&s;hes of Salt Fi&s;h, purchas'd from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, were brought and &s;et upon the Cloaths; together with &s;everal Pa&s;trie Meats, dry'd Rai&s;ins, Comfits, Almonds, and Pi&s;taches, and other provocatives to drink. The repa&s;t being ended, &s;everal Buffons were brought in, who Sung and Danc'd after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, and made a hundred wry Mouths and ugly Faces. Among the re&s;t of the Diverti&s;ements, there were two Men introuduc'd, that play'd one again&s;t another with each a Battoon in his hand, with a piece of Linnen dipt in Naphta, ty'd to the end of the Stick, which ca&s;t forth a very clear brightne&s;s in the dark; at the &s;ame time four artificial Whirle-Winds were made to ri&s;e one after another, which were all hovering in the Air at once, and in a continual Agitation.</P>
<P>Three Hours after Midnight the Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies came to rai&s;e the Deputies to take leave of the King; and &s;o leading them to the lower end of the Hall, after a profound reverence, they retir'd, not one per&s;on be&s;ide &s;tirring out of his place, to the end they might have time to take their Shoes without confu&s;ion. When they were gone, the King di&s;mi&s;s'd the Court, and then it is that the croud is &s;o great, that not one in twenty but lo&s;es their own, and gets who&s;e-ever Shoes he can lay his hands on.</P>
<P>The Deputies and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being upon their return home, by that time they got half way, met an Officer belonging to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="495">
who told Father <HI>Raphael</HI> that his Ma&s;ter expected the <HI>French Begzades</HI> at his Hou&s;e by Ten a Clock next Morning, to treat them, by his Maje&s;ties Order.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Raphael, Lalin,</HI> and <HI>Boulaye,</HI> were punctual to their time, and no &s;ooner did the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> know of their arrival, but he came down into his Hall of Audience, to receive them, where he had al&s;o order'd a very fair Banquet to be ready for their entertainment. There Father <HI>Raphael</HI> left them, while he went with the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI>'s Secre|tary, to Tran&s;late the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lan|guage; which being fini&s;h'd, and he come again into the Hall, after &s;everal Civilities pa&s;t on both &s;ides, the Father and the Deputies return'd to <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant Deputies offended at the Honour which the Gentle|men had receiv'd, would have gone in their Turn; but Father <HI>Raphael</HI> told them, that it was not the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to vi&s;it the Prime Mi|ni&s;ter, without being &s;ent for. In the Evening, Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and the <HI>Begzades</HI> received new Orders to attend the King, but the King &s;tirr'd not out that Evening, &s;o that their Journey was in vain.</P>
<P>The Merchants &s;till perceiving the Honours which were done the Gentlemen, and believing Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to be the cau&s;e of all, they began to rail at him, and give him &s;oul Language, and threaten'd to write into <HI>France</HI> to give an accompt of his behaviour. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> netled at the Language of the Deputies, told them, that he had done what in him lay to procure them the &s;ame Honours, which the others had receiv'd, though they were &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of it. That he would continue his endeavours for the Advancement of their Affairs, though not for their own &s;akes, yet for the &s;ake of the Company, that had &s;ent them. Which an&s;wer, though it were &s;harp enough, and &s;hew'd that the Father was angry, yet he did not forget, that they were his Coun|trymen; &s;o that he ventur'd to carry them twice to the Prime Mini&s;ter of his own accord, contrary to the Cu&s;tom. The fir&s;t time he was not to be &s;poken with. The &s;econd time, he made an Errant to him with the three Deputies, to pre&s;ent him a Copy of the Letter from the Directors of the Company, in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; at which time he &s;hew'd them the Deputies, acquainting him withal that tho&s;e were the Per&s;ons with whom he was to treat in point of Trade. To which the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> reply'd, that he had no Commi&s;&s;ion from the King to meddle with tho&s;e Deputies, but only, to entertain the <HI>Bagzade</HI> that brought the King's Letter, which he had already done. Thereupon the Father de&s;ir'd him he would be pleas'd to &s;peak to the King to nomi|nate Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with them, which the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> pro|mis'd to do. That day in the evening, a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to acquaint him, that the King had appointed the <HI>Nazar</HI> to treat with the Deputies the next day, and to know their demands. Of which the Father gave the Deputies quick intelligence.</P>
<P>The next day, being the Fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fail'd not to be with the Deputies very early in the Morning, to bring them to the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but he was very much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee, that they would not go altogether, but &s;till loo'k with an evil Eye one upon another, and continued their former differences. To the end therefore that he might &s;et things to rights, he went to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and told him, that he thought it would be the be&s;t way for the Merchants Deputies to come
<PB N="33" REF="495">
becau&s;e that they were the Per&s;ons with whom he was chiefly to Treat. The <HI>Nazar</HI> an&s;wer'd, that the King under&s;tood that they were all five in the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion joyntly. To which, when the Father an&s;wer'd the &s;econd time, that it would be the be&s;t way to do as he had propos'd; The <HI>Nazar</HI> with a Surly Countenance, why, What's the matter now? &s;aid he to the Father; Are not you <HI>French-men</HI> a&s;ham'd to be thus at odds one with another, and to give all the World, nay the very Foot-boys occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e of your Divi&s;ions? What would they have us think of them and their Commi&s;&s;ion? Are they &s;o little afraid of offending the King? Or, is their King more indulgent then the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who would never pardon &s;uch faults in his Subjects? To this rebuke the Father made no reply. Only he de&s;ir'd the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that he might have two Hor&s;e-men to attend the Deputies at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> telling the <HI>Nazar</HI> not a word of his de&s;ign to bring the Merchants an Hour &s;ooner then the Gentlemen. This fell out to the Fathers de&s;ire; For the Father &s;ent one of the Hor&s;e-men to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> to the Gentlemen, with order to drink with them, and not to be over ha&s;ty, but to bring them fair and &s;oftly along with him; with the other he made ha&s;t to the Merchant Deputies, and cau&s;ing them to double their pace, they got betimes to the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where they were civilly receiv'd. <HI>Dupont</HI> pre&s;ented the <HI>Nazar</HI> with the Deputies Commi&s;&s;ion, tran&s;lated into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language; after which they fell into a di&s;cour&s;e, which la&s;ted above three quartes of an Hour, concerning the Cu&s;toms, Tolls, and Qua|lity of the Merchants, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> in their Dealing. They had ju&s;t fini&s;h'd their Di&s;cour&s;e of Trade, when the <HI>Nazar</HI> was advertiz'd, that the three Gentlemen were arriv'd; who thereupon de&s;ir'd Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to go and receive them. The Father went and waited upon them in, neatly chiding them for having &s;tay'd &s;o long, and making the <HI>Nazar</HI> wait. Well &s;aid he, now you are together, go into that Cabinet, and write down you demands, and the Articles of your Commi&s;&s;ion. The Merchant Deputies, which had now di&s;|cours'd with the <HI>Nazar</HI> what they had to &s;ay, were well enough con|tent to enter into a General Conference with the Gentlemen. Then calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, they made a draught of their Demands, the chief of which were, three Years Immunity from Cu&s;toms and Tolls, to begin from the time of the arrival of our Ships; and that after that, they &s;hould enjoy all the Priviledges and Favours granted to other Nations. They al&s;o de&s;ir'd precedence above all other Nations, when they &s;hould be call'd to Court, as they &s;ugge&s;ted, that they had at the Court of the Grand Signior. And la&s;tly, they requir'd a Hou&s;e for tho&s;e that belong'd to the Company, to live in the City.</P>
<P>The&s;e demands were dictated word for word by Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to the <HI>Nazars</HI> Secretary, in the Name of all the five Gentlemen; and becau&s;e the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Secretary knew not how to pronounce them, the Father undertook to write them in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Character; which being done, and the writing read in the hearing of the Deputies, the <HI>Nazar</HI> took the Paper to pre&s;ent to the King.</P>
<P>Thus after a fair Banquet, accompany'd with Mu&s;ic, both Vocal and In&s;trumental, the Deputies were di&s;mi&s;s'd by the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who bid them rely upon his care; for that he would do them all the Favour that lay in his pow'r, and give them his Maje&s;ties An&s;wer in a &s;hort time. The Deputies very well &s;atisfy'd with the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s reception, &s;ent him
<PB N="34" REF="496">
afterwards a Pre&s;ent, which was a Shame both to the Nation and the Company, that pretended to &s;uch great and high things, and endea|vour'd to fix an opinion of their Wealth and Grandeur among Strangers. For they &s;ent him only a <HI>Tin Cup</HI> Enamel'd, and eight little Ca&s;es of Per&s;pectives, or Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, the whole not amounting to above 40 Crowns. They al&s;o made much &s;uch another Pre&s;ent, but meaner, to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about a Dozen Pair of Gilt Sci&s;&s;ars for Women. We mu&s;t &s;peak the Truth: For they were not a little laught at for their ridiculous Pre&s;ents, which were the Scorn and Contempt of tho&s;e that receiv'd them, when the Deputies were gone.</P>
<P>To Father <HI>Raphael</HI> they pre&s;ented a Pur&s;e, with 40 <HI>Tomans,</HI> or Six Hundred Crowns in it, believing that he would never accept of it; and indeed he refus'd it with &s;corn; not a little angry with them, that they &s;hould have &s;uch mean thoughts of him, as to believe him Mercenary.</P>
<P>Two days after, the <HI>Nazar</HI> gave notice to the Father, that the King had granted the <HI>French</HI> their Demands; and had order'd every one of them a <HI>Calaat,</HI> or a Ve&s;t-Royal, and in re&s;pect of Superiority, a Hor&s;e for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lalin.</HI> That the Kings An&s;wer and the <HI>Grant</HI> were both ready for the Directors of the Company, according to their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The King was then onward upon a journey to <HI>Mazandran,</HI> three days Travel from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> at one of his Palaces, call'd <HI>Tajabat.</HI> A Plea&s;ant Situation, in the mid'&s;t of a great Valley, &s;haded with Trees, and full of Villages.</P>
<P>The Ninth of <HI>October,</HI> came a Letter from the <HI>Nazar,</HI> to Father <HI>Ra|phael,</HI> &s;ignifyiug the King's Plea&s;ure, that both he and the Deputies &s;hould repair to <HI>Tajabat</HI> with all &s;peed. Thereupon the Father and they made &s;uch ha&s;t, that in le&s;s than three days they got to <HI>Tajabat,</HI> where the <HI>Nazar</HI> order'd them to lye in the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Armenian</HI> Renegado. The King &s;ent them immediately eight or ten bottles of Wine, with four Gold Di&s;hes, full of lovely Fruits, and Tapi&s;tries for their Dining Room. But the&s;e Pre&s;ents occa&s;ion'd new Quarrels; For there being two Factions, and both living apart, there was a great di&s;pute who &s;hould have this pre&s;ent. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> having done all that po&s;&s;ible he could to reconcile the bu&s;ine&s;s, and not being able to per&s;uade them, in a ju&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, bid them take their Swords and Pi&s;tols, and go and decide the Quarrel in the Field. Till now, &s;aid he, I have done all I could to conceal your dete&s;table divi&s;ions from the Court, which neverthele&s;s, is but too well acquainted therewith: Is it your de&s;ign to publi&s;h your own Ignominy, and to make not only your &s;elves, but the whole Nation of the <HI>French</HI> ridiculous to the <HI>Per&s;ians?</HI> At length they were &s;o far reconcil'd, that one Room &s;erv'd them to Feed, and con&s;equently the &s;ame Furniture. For the Father's reproofs had put them a little out of Countenance.</P>
<P>The Seventeenth of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Mehemander</HI> came to the Deputies Lodgings, and brought five Royal Ve&s;ts; The Riche&s;t, which was of Ti&s;&s;ue of Gold, was for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lalin;</HI> the next, not altogether &s;o rich, for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boulaye;</HI> and the other three of a lower price, for the Merchants; The value of the whole might amount to 600 Crowns, for which the <HI>French</HI> Deputies mo&s;t generou&s;ly gave the Officers that brought them 25 or 30 Crowns, as a Gratuity. The Officers of the
<PB N="35" REF="496">
Stable al&s;o brought two Hor&s;es for the Gentlemen, for which they receiv'd &s;ix Crowns in Gold, as a reward. I confe&s;s, I &s;hould have been a&s;ham'd of &s;uch a poorne&s;s of Spirit, at &s;uch a time as that.</P>
<P>At length al&s;o the <HI>Ragan</HI> or Patent for the Company was deliver'd into the Hands of the Deputies, faithfully Tran&s;lated by Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to this Effect.</P>
<P><Q>That whereas the Merchants of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> who are favour'd by the Favour extreemly Royal, and the Ju&s;tice exce&s;&s;ively Royal, being made con&s;tant in the hope and participation in the time, have pre&s;ented their Petition, which is arriv'd at the Ear of the Mini&s;ters Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Court of Grandeur and high Fortune; Their Intentions and Demands have found the Vi&s;age of Acceptation, and we have &s;trictly commanded, that the Con&s;ervatours of Rights, Tolls and Priviledges, acknowledge them for exempt and priviledg'd, during the &s;pace of Three Years; and that there be nothing demanded upon their Goods and Factories, conformable to the reque&s;t of the Deputies,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next day, the <HI>Mehemander Bachi,</HI> came early in the Morning to attend the Deputies, and bring them with all &s;peed to the Court: Where being admitted into the Garden, they met the King a Hor&s;e|back, and all the Court a Foot. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> held the King's An&s;wer to the King of <HI>France,</HI> in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, Seal'd with the Kings Seal upon red <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wax. The Sieur <HI>Lalin</HI> then, and the re&s;t of the Deputies were order'd to go neer and Ki&s;s the Kings Boot, who kept his Grandeur, without &s;peaking a word. When they had &s;o done, the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> calling them to him, there, &s;aid he, there is the An&s;wer for the <HI>Grand Cha,</HI> that is, for the King of the Kings of <HI>France.</HI> The Deputies having made their Obey&s;ances to the King, the whole Court took Hor&s;e; and the King took the Road of <HI>Cachan;</HI> and within an Hour, that Campaign, which look'd like a thick peopl'd City, became as De&s;ert as the mo&s;t part of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Deputies, having read over the Patent, began to find many defects, and <HI>Mariage</HI> would fain have follow'd the Court for amendments, and would have per&s;uaded <HI>Lalin</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to have gone along with him. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> over-per&s;uaded them to return fir&s;t to their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and there to hear the Patent di&s;tinctly read over, and to con&s;ider better of it. When they came to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and that they had debated upon the meer Letter of the <HI>Patent,</HI> then they were wor&s;e mad then they were before. Then there were &s;o many Cavils, &s;o many Di&s;putes, &s;o many Exceptions, and &s;o many Expo|&s;itions put upon the Words <HI>Conformably</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;onably,</HI> that they mu&s;t get a Hor&s;e back immediately. <HI>Boulaye</HI> &s;topp'd this fury for a while; So that after many Di&s;putes and Con&s;ultations, it was agreed, that <HI>Mariage,</HI> as chief of the Negotiation, and <HI>Lalin,</HI> &s;hould follow the Court; and that <HI>Boulaye, Breber,</HI> and <HI>Dupont,</HI> &s;hould proceed forward to the <HI>Indies.</HI> The Sieur <HI>L'E&s;toile,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the <HI>Franks,</HI> were of opinion, that <HI>Lalin</HI> &s;hould forthwith depart for <HI>France,</HI> with the King's Letter. But their Coun&s;el was not follow'd, and &s;o the Deputies divided them|&s;elves: <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> to follow the Court, which was then remov'd as far as <HI>Mazandran:</HI> And the other three to pur&s;ue their Journey to the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> The two former fain would have had Father <HI>Raphael</HI> have accompany'd them to the Court; but he fairly excus'd him&s;elf.
<PB N="36" REF="497">
Neither would <HI>L'E&s;toile</HI> permit his Son, to whom he allow'd 20 <HI>Tomans</HI> a Year, to return to the Court, choo&s;ing rather to &s;end him to <HI>Bander</HI> with the other three. Whereupon, the Seventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> they &s;et forward upon their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>Du Pont,</HI> without doubt, was the mo&s;t &s;olid and judicious of all the Merchants, but he took it &s;o to heart, to &s;ee the di&s;-union among them, that he fell into a langui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;e at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and dy'd not far from <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage,</HI> they left <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> the Fifteenth of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> and arriv'd at Court &s;oon after, where they lay a long time neg|lected, their Divi&s;ions &s;till continuing, which made them contempti|ble to the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and ruin'd the Affairs of the Company. One Evening, the <HI>Nazar</HI> &s;ent them a Flow'r, advi&s;ing them, that as that Flow'r never chang'd; &s;o it became them not to vary in their Re&s;olutions. After a long and tedious &s;tay, <HI>Mariage</HI> obtain'd &s;ome few impertinent Alterations in his Patent; and permi&s;&s;ion to make Wine at <HI>Schiras,</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Alterations they both leave the Court; and <HI>Mariage</HI> would certainly have accompany'd <HI>Lalin,</HI> who had an intention to &s;ee <HI>Ardevil, Tauris,</HI> and <HI>Kom,</HI> had he not been &s;olicited to return to <HI>Zul|pha,</HI> by a Young <HI>Dalilah,</HI> that had &s;mitten his heart. For by the means of an old Woman, the Mother of one of his Lacqueys, he had de|bauch'd a young <HI>Armenian</HI> Virgin, whom he kept privately to him&s;elf; yet not &s;o privately, but the noi&s;e thereof was quickly &s;pread all over <HI>Zulpha.</HI> All the <HI>Armenians</HI> were &s;candaliz'd at it, and &s;ent to &s;eize the Baud, to puni&s;h her, by their Laws, as &s;he de&s;erv'd. <HI>Mariage</HI> adver|tiz'd thereof, flew out of his Lodging to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to protect her from Ju&s;tice. But &s;eeing the People in an uproar, and finding the Stones to flye too thick about his Ears, he was forc'd to mind his own &s;afety, and to &s;eek for &s;helter in the next Hou&s;e where he could be ad|mitted. But the Bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;o put up, for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> won|dring to &s;ee that a Deputy of an Illu&s;trious Company, who was come to the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> upon &s;o &s;erious an Affair, &s;hould do &s;o much wrong to his Nation, by publickly appearing in &s;o &s;hameful an Action, and &s;o unworthy of a Per&s;on in public Employment, that they re&s;olv'd to pro&s;e|cute him all manner of ways. They were re&s;olv'd, to that end, to have &s;ent into <HI>France</HI> an Expre&s;s, to have Complain'd to the King of his ill Management and bad Behaviour. But <HI>Mariage</HI> at length re&s;tor'd the <HI>Armenian</HI> Girl which he had kept clo&s;e lock'd up; after which time the <HI>Armenians</HI> never look'd upon him but with &s;corn and contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Lalin</HI> being return'd to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> departed thence the 22<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> 1666. for <HI>Bander,</HI> with a Re&s;olution, to Travel into the <HI>Indies.</HI> But he fell &s;ick at <HI>Bander,</HI> and thinking to return to <HI>Schiras,</HI> for the Air's &s;ake, he dy'd by the way at a Village call'd <HI>Bend-Ali.</HI> A Gen|tleman endow'd with noble Qualities, and who&s;e Gentile and Generous behaviour was an honour to his Nation.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth of the &s;ame <HI>November, Mariage</HI> al&s;o left <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and departed for <HI>Bander,</HI> with one Father <HI>Mercier,</HI> a <HI>Je&s;uite,</HI> whom he took along with him as his Almoner, and <HI>Lewis L' E&s;toile,</HI> his <HI>Kalmachi,</HI> or Interpreter: There he &s;tay'd four Months for the arrival of the Ships, but none coming, and the heats encrea&s;ing, he re&s;olv'd to &s;pend the re&s;t of the Year at <HI>Schiras.</HI> As for the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> and young <HI>L' E&s;toile,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="497">
becau&s;e there was no Conver&s;e but with the people of the Country, they return'd back to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Suratte</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> 1666. Being come to the <HI>Bar,</HI> they &s;ent to Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e,</HI> chief of the Mi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> who pre&s;ently attended them with a Sloop, which he had obtain'd of the Governour, and brought them home to the <HI>Capu|chin</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where they &s;tay'd till they departed for <HI>Agra.</HI> Some|time before was arriv'd there a Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who had run him|&s;elf out at heels, and of a <HI>Maronite</HI> Chri&s;tian was become a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, in hopes to patch up his broken Fortune, being in truth a meer Counterfeit, and a Hypocrite: For the&s;e <HI>Levantine</HI> Chri&s;tians &s;eldom change their Religion, but upon &s;ome motive of Intere&s;t; and when they have got a good Sum together, they pre&s;ently whip back again into their own Country, and for a &s;mall piece of Money obtain ab&s;olution of their Patriarch. Thus &s;everal of the Religious <HI>Franks</HI> that travel out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are often deceiv'd, making a great noi&s;e of their Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Levantines,</HI> when the Conver&s;ion, at the bottom, is only an outward Conver&s;ion, and a meer piece of Gul|lery. Among many others that I could relate, I will only mention one, of a <HI>Franci&s;can,</HI> call'd <HI>Paul Stella,</HI> who coming with 400 Crowns, or thereabouts, in his Pocket, for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, a <HI>Maronite</HI> &s;melt him out, and under the pretence of giving him the Honour of his Conver|&s;ion to the Catholick Religion, never left him till he had &s;uck'd him dry, and turn'd the Channel of his Money. This <HI>Maronite</HI> Merchant before mention'd, who&s;e Name was <HI>Chelebi,</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf very zealous for the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and he had rea&s;on enough; for the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI> had been very &s;erviceable to him, and had help'd him in his Affairs when they were at the lowe&s;t ebb. They were overjoy'd at his arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI> and gave it out immediately that it was he that had given them Money for the building their Hou&s;e and Church. But when I came to look over my Accompts, I found that the Money that had pay'd for the Ground and a good &s;hare of the building, came out of my Pur&s;e; Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e</HI> having promis'd that I &s;hould be reimburs'd upon my return to <HI>Paris.</HI> But I never heard more of my Money, nor indeed did I ever look after it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the <HI>Capuchins</HI> were willing that the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant, who never had disburs'd a Peny, &s;hould own the Expences of their Hou&s;e and Church, is this; becau&s;e no <HI>Frangui</HI> Chri&s;tian is permitted in the <HI>Indies</HI> to enjoy the propriety of Hou&s;es, or to make any reparati|ons of tho&s;e which they hire, without the leave of the Governour of the place. Both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Companies are only <HI>Le&s;&s;ees</HI> to the <HI>Indians;</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> having &s;uffer'd from the Chri&s;tians in &s;eve|ral places, where under pretence of repairing or adorning certain Hou&s;es, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by way of propriety, they have &s;o well fortifi'd them, that when the Governours have come to require any Duties from them, they have made them good &s;o long, till they have forc'd the Governours to yield to their demands.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Deputies were landed at <HI>Surat,</HI> they pre&s;ently &s;pread abroad a report, that there were &s;even or eight Ships belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Company that would &s;uddainly follow them. The <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant was overjoy'd to hear the News, and was in great hopes, that by the favour of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and the advantage which he had of &s;peaking
<PB N="38" REF="498">
&s;everal of the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Languages, that the greate&s;t part of the <HI>French</HI> Merchandize would pa&s;s through his hands. Upon the&s;e hopes he made great Treats, and pre&s;ented large Pre&s;ents to the Deputies, and maintain'd their Servants at his own Charges. He found the De|puties to be &s;ufficiently covetous, but he was &s;till in great expectations, that his civil Entertainments, and the Pre&s;ents which they receiv'd from him, would oblige them to acknowledge his kindne&s;s, and that one day he &s;hould find him&s;elf repay'd by the management of their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but he was foully mi&s;taken. For it co&s;t him above 1500 <HI>Rupies,</HI> part which he &s;pent upon them him&s;elf at <HI>Surat,</HI> and partly what his Nephew furni&s;h'd them withall at <HI>Agra</HI> for their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Three or four days after their arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident &s;ent to vi&s;it them by &s;ome of his Council, and would have waited on them him&s;elf, but that he lay then ill of the Gout. The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander did the &s;ame with his Council, &s;hewing all the civilities and kindne&s;&s;es that lay in his power; and a few days after invited them &s;olemnly to a great Fea&s;t, with as many as they could bring along with them. In the mid&s;t of their Jollity the King's Health was &s;ent about, and after that, the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>French</HI> Company; which oblig'd <HI>Boulaye</HI> to begin another Health to the happy Progre&s;s of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company. But when it came to Mr. <HI>Beber</HI>'s turn to drink it, notwith&s;tanding all that <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Company could &s;ay to him, they could not oblige him to pledge it. Nay, he did wor&s;e then this, for he threw the Gla&s;s, Wine, and all at his Feet; and when he had &s;o done, he ro&s;e in a heat from the Table, and after a pitiful manner left the Company, and went home to his Lodging, though without any attendance. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;o di&s;creet as to take little notice of his folly, but remain'd very merry at the Table with Mr. <HI>Boulaye</HI> till Midnight. But they could not forbear telling their Friends, that they wonder'd, in regard there were &s;o many di&s;creet and ingenious Men in <HI>France,</HI> that the Company &s;hould make choice of &s;uch a Fool for the management of &s;uch an important Affair as he was &s;ent about; and that they fore&s;aw he would do the Company no &s;mall injury.</P>
<P>While the Deputies &s;tay'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> the Governour of the place, at the reque&s;t of Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e,</HI> entertain'd them, and &s;hew'd them all the re&s;pect that could be &s;hew'd to Strangers. One day that they were in Di&s;cour&s;e together, he told them, that if they would follow his Coun&s;el, he adviz'd them not to go to Court till their Ships were arriv'd. But &s;eeing that they were re&s;olv'd to the contrary, he offer'd them Money, Hor&s;es, and Souldiers, to attend them, with Letters of Recommendation to &s;ome of the Grandees of the Court. The <HI>Cha|bander,</HI> or Provo&s;t of Merchants, made them the &s;ame offers that the Governour had done; all which they refus'd very ob&s;tinately. More then this, they behav'd them&s;elves very ill, in reference to the Pre&s;ents which the Governour and the <HI>Cha-Bander</HI> &s;ent them, for they gave their Servants that carry'd them not a <HI>Doight,</HI> which is look'd upon as a very dirty action in the <HI>Indies.</HI> For the <HI>Indians</HI> never give their Ser|vants any other Wages, then what they get by carrying Pre&s;ents from their Ma&s;ters. And the more they have given them, the more Honour it is, both for him that receives, and him that &s;ends the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Deputies then being re&s;olv'd for <HI>Agra,</HI> hir'd their Waynes, and their Oxen to carry their Luggage, and five and twenty Souldiers for
<PB N="93" REF="498">
their Convoy. They likewi&s;e made a great noi&s;e, of their being honour'd from &s;o Great a King, and &s;o Noble a Company. Upon which &s;core, they ought to have had five or &s;ix Wains for their Baggage, every one their <HI>Pallaquin</HI> and a Led-hor&s;e, and every one a Flag with their Arms or their Cyphers, which is the gentile way of Travelling in <HI>India,</HI> and as I was always wont to travel. But they took but five and twenty Souldiers, whereas they ought to have hir'd an hundred and fifty at the rate they talk'd.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of &s;o doing, three Days Journey from <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> began to quarrel with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> that they had too great a Train at their heels, for which he blam'd the Advi&s;e of Father <HI>Ambroi&s;e</HI> and the Merchant of <HI>Aleppo:</HI> That for his part he would pay for no more than four Souldiers, and that if he would not &s;end the re&s;t back, he &s;hould pay them him&s;elf. Upon which, they agreed to &s;end back the &s;ix Souldiers which the Governour had order'd to attend them as far as <HI>Brampour;</HI> upon their di&s;mi&s;&s;ment, not giving them &s;o much as the Worth of a Pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Chelebi,</HI> the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant, fail'd not to wait upon them, and to offer them his &s;ervice. There was at that time a <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon, who&s;e Name was <HI>James,</HI> he &s;pake good <HI>Indian,</HI> and was married in the Country to the Daughter of a <HI>Portugal:</HI> The <HI>Nahab,</HI> the King's Uncle and Grand Vizier, had a great kindne&s;s for this Chirurgeon; and by his procurement it was, that the Deputies had Audience of <HI>Giafer-Kan,</HI> for &s;o was the <HI>Nahab</HI> call'd. They reque&s;ted of him, that by his favour they might pre&s;ent a Letter from their King to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> as al&s;o that they might be admitted to treat concerning the Settlement of a <HI>French</HI> Trade in the Countrey. The <HI>Nahab</HI> told them, that he would &s;peak to the King, and take care that they &s;hould be admitted to their Audience in a little time. With that he order'd them to be conducted to the Lodgings appointed for them, which they found ready furni&s;h'd with all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for the Belly; but their Lacqueys and Servants were to cook it them&s;elves; for it is not here as it is in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the Meat is &s;ent ready dre&s;t out of the King's Kitchin to the Emba&s;&s;adors Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nahab,</HI> who under&s;tood that they had brought no Pre&s;ents, neither for him, nor any of the Grandees of the Court, nor for the King him&s;elf, was not over ha&s;ty to admit them to their Audience. So that it was above a Month before the Deputies could &s;et Eyes upon the <HI>Nahab</HI> again, though the Chirurgeon, and other <HI>Franguis,</HI> us'd all their Intere&s;t in their behalf. Being very weary of this Delay, they gave it out, that they could &s;tay no longer at <HI>Agra,</HI> in regard they were to be at <HI>Surat</HI> upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els. Upon which fal&s;e Report, the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent to them for the King their Ma&s;ter's Letter, that he might pre&s;ent it to the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> him&s;elf. Upon this Demand of their Letter, they were quite blank, not being acquainted with the manner how the Kings of <HI>India</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eive tho&s;e Letters which are brought them by Emba&s;&s;adors: For they never receive any with their own hands, but &s;uch as come from the <HI>Grand Signior:</HI> All other Letters, according to the Grandeur of the Kings that &s;end them, are put into the hands of the Grand Officers of the Court, who pre&s;ent them to the King: And the more potent the King is, from whom the Letter comes, through the fewer hands it pa&s;&s;es before it is pre&s;ented

to the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI> For the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is very well known in the Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the Difference between the Soveraigns of both, in reference to their Grandeur and Pui&s;&s;ance. Neither is there a Stranger that enters into the Kingdom, of whom the Governour of the Frontier Province does not give advice to the <HI>Nahab;</HI> and if he appear to be a per&s;on of Ingenuity, there's no help for't, but he mu&s;t go to Court, where he is care&s;s'd, on purpo&s;e to get information of the Country from whence he comes.</P>
<P>But to return to the Deputies, they ob&s;tinately refu&s;'d to &s;end the Letter to the <HI>Nahab:</HI> At which he was not a little troubl'd; fearing le&s;t upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, it might be the occa&s;ion of a Rupture, and hinder the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty of Commerce. Moreover he was not a little jealous, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eize upon the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;els in their Voyage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> as <HI>Hugh Lambert</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI> Pyrat did, who took all the Baggage belonging to the Queen of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> when &s;he was going to <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina.</HI> The <HI>Nahab</HI> having made the&s;e Reflexions to him&s;elf, &s;o wrought with the King, that he con&s;ented that the Deputies, contrary to cu&s;tom, &s;hould be admitted into his pre&s;ence, there to give the Letter into the Hands of the Prime Mini&s;ter, to be by him pre&s;ented to the King. This, as I &s;aid before, was an unu&s;ual favour; and yet the Deputies were &s;o ob&s;tinate, as to reject this Propo&s;ition, &s;aying, that they would rather return home, and carry back their Letters, then not pre&s;ent them to the King them&s;elves. This ob&s;tinacy of theirs, to maintain their own conceited humour again&s;t the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey, was very much blam'd by all people, that admir'd at the patience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at length &s;ent them word, they might take their own cour&s;e, &s;ince they refu&s;'d the Honours which he would have done them. After that, the Deputies &s;taid ten or twelve days in the City, flattering them&s;elves, that the <HI>Nahab</HI> would comply with their Folly; but they were deceiv'd. For the <HI>Nahab</HI> offended at their idle carriage, took &s;uch order, that not one per&s;on living, either Merchant or other, went to vi&s;it them all the while. So that they re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> in expectation of their Ships.</P>
<P>When they left <HI>Agra,</HI> they went and lay two Leagues off from the City in the Field, &s;etting up one Tent apiece, (and tho&s;e pitiful ones Heaven knows) to &s;erve for them and their Servants, whereas they might have lodg'd with more &s;ecurity in a fair Inn that &s;tood not far off. Now it is the Cu&s;tom at the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Court, that every Night &s;ome Prince or great Lord keeps Guard in his turn for a Week together, having under him five or &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e, that beat the Road for three or four Leagues round the place where the King quarters. A Party of the&s;e Hor&s;emen &s;couting by the Deputies Tents, and enquiring who&s;e they were, one of the Servants reply'd, that they were the Tents of the <HI>French</HI> Deputies: of which the Hor&s;emen gave immediate notice to their Captain, at that time the Grand Provo&s;t of the Empire. A Per&s;on hand&s;om, well endow'd, and a great Lover of Strangers, who had rai&s;'d him&s;elf by his Valour, as being an <HI>Aby&s;&s;in</HI> by Nation. So &s;oon as he under&s;tood that they were the <HI>French</HI> Deputies, he &s;ent one of his principal Officers, with fifty Hor&s;e, to de&s;ire them to give them leave to guard them that Night, becau&s;e they were in no &s;ecurity, and for that if they came to any mi&s;chief the Head of their
<PB N="41" REF="499">
Captain mu&s;t an&s;wer for it. But they very ill receiv'd the kind proffer of the Provo&s;t, proudly an&s;wering, that they were &s;trong enough to guard them&s;elves, and the fir&s;t that came near them &s;hould know whe|ther the <HI>French</HI> had Courage or no, adding withal, that if their Captain were afraid, they would guard him, with a deal of other &s;currilous riffraff which very much &s;urpriz'd the Officers.</P>
<P>The next day they &s;et up their Tents about a quarter of a League far|ther, becau&s;e they expected &s;omething to be brought them from <HI>Agra.</HI> The <HI>Conteval</HI> or Grand Provo&s;t admiring they made &s;uch &s;low journeys, and that they had now pitch'd in a more dangerous place then before, &s;ent the &s;ame Hor&s;emen with the &s;ame proffer, or el&s;e that they would be pleas'd to lye in an Inn where they might be &s;afe. <HI>Boulaye</HI> was of the mind that &s;o kind an offer &s;hould not be refus'd: but <HI>Beber</HI> gave them nothing but bad language; reviling their Captain, that he was afraid they &s;hould go and lye with his wives, offering if he pleas'd to go and guard them. He &s;poke half Portugue&s;e, half Italian, which being a kind of <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> &s;ome of the Hor&s;emen made a &s;hift to under&s;tand him, and having made a report to the Grand Provo&s;t of his In&s;olent An&s;wer, the Lord was not a little nettl'd at it, and therefore re&s;olv'd to be re|veng'd. About midnight four&s;core or a hundred Hor&s;e came and cut all the Cords of <HI>Bebers</HI> Tent, thinking to have let it fall about his ears. But he found a way to quit him&s;elf by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Servant; and en|deavour'd to e&s;cape to the Hou&s;e of a <HI>Dervich</HI> on the other &s;ide of a &s;mall Rivolet, nere the place where the Tents were &s;et up. But the Moon &s;hining as bright as day, he could not hide him&s;elf from the pur&s;uit of the Hor&s;emen, who &s;hot at him, and with their Arrows wounded him in three places, once in the thigh and twice in the buttocks. <HI>Bou|laye</HI> hearing the noi&s;e which the Hor&s;emen made, peep'd out of his Tent, and &s;eeing &s;o many Hor&s;emen in pur&s;uit of <HI>Beber,</HI> was not a little daunt|ed. He was afraid of running the &s;ame <HI>ri&s;co;</HI> but not having long to con&s;ider, he took his pur&s;e of Duckets, and fled till he got about half a league off, where he lay all night under a great Tree. But by the con|&s;equence he found that the Hor&s;emen had nothing to &s;ay to him; being &s;atisfi'd when they &s;aw <HI>Beber</HI> fall, as believing him dead. For had they not thought him &s;o, they would never have left him, till they had quite done his bu&s;ine&s;s. But to colour the bu&s;ine&s;s, that it might not &s;eem a point of revenge they broke open all <HI>Beber</HI>'s Che&s;ts; that it might &s;eem as if he had bin robb'd; but they found very little or nothing to enrich them&s;elves.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Beber</HI>'s boy &s;aw that the Hor&s;emen were gone, he ran to the Town for a <HI>Pallanquin</HI> to carry his Ma&s;ter thither. Being brought to the Town they laid him in the Je&s;uits hou&s;e, where <HI>Boulaye</HI> al&s;o arriv'd not long after and took up his Quarters, to the great con&s;olation of the Je&s;uits, who&s;e Revenues are but &s;mall in tho&s;e parts, where there are no devout people to leave them Legacies. Their Ordinary was very &s;paring; but it was &s;uch as the Deputies mu&s;t be glad of. Though it were a fea&s;t for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who was not wont to make better chear. For a Sheeps head, of his own purcha&s;e, u&s;ually &s;erv'd him two meals. Which made him ridiculous to the <HI>Franks,</HI> who liv'd after a more &s;plendid rate. At <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> when he was not invited by the <HI>Franguis,</HI> he had recour&s;e to his Sheeps tongues, or a cold piece of double Tripe, which he carri'd to the poor <HI>Cabaretts</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> taking his Chopin of Wine
<PB N="42" REF="500">
to wa&s;h it down: and &s;uch was his good husbandry that what was left was order'd to be &s;et up for his &s;upper. One day he had drank a little more then he had bled, and the <HI>Franguis</HI> found him a &s;leep in the &s;treet, about a hundred paces from the Cabaret. They had &s;o much charity for him as to remove him to his lodging, le&s;t other Nations &s;hould laugh at the choice which they had made of an Envoy to &s;ettle the Trade of &s;uch a con&s;iderable Company. As for <HI>Beber,</HI> who lov'd good Chear when it co&s;t him nothing, as being a true exemplar of covetou&s;ne&s;s, he com|plain'd of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> entertainment, though they out-run the Con&s;table to treat him like a Deputy. His man who had more wit than he, and plainly &s;aw what a trouble he was to his Ho&s;ts, made them a merry relation of the Noble Table which his Ma&s;ter kept for him, how he had made pro|vi&s;ion of a Barrel of Herrings; which when Invitations fail'd, he wa|rily fed upon, rubbing his bread with the tail to give it a <HI>haut goust.</HI> For my part, &s;aid the Boy, I am but a poor Servant, yet I have made a &s;hift to &s;pend an hundred and fifty Crowns which I had got in the &s;ervice of the Con&s;ul of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> 'Twas my misfortune to be inveigl'd out of his &s;ervice, for I was with a Noble Ma&s;ter where I got Money; but in this man's &s;ervice I have eaten all that I had got before. Two days after I arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> and heard of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded and where he lay, and went to give him a vi&s;it. And as I never went unprovided in my travels with all things nece&s;&s;ary, I had &s;ome Oyntments and Pla&s;ters, which were very &s;erviceable to him.</P>
<P>It was an ea&s;ie thing to ob&s;erve that <HI>Boulaye</HI> was glad of the opportu|nity of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded, that he might have the &s;ole honour of giving the Letter to the King. For he pretended to be the true <HI>Envoy</HI> from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that <HI>Beber</HI> was only &s;ent to bear him com|pany. <HI>La Boulaye</HI> therefore believing that the bu&s;ine&s;s would take effect, per&s;uaded the Chyrurgion already mention'd to &s;olicit the <HI>Nahab</HI> who had a kindne&s;s for him, &s;o clo&s;e, that thereby the <HI>Nahab</HI> permitted him to bring the Letter. But <HI>Boulaye</HI> who thought he &s;hould give it him&s;elf to the King, was much &s;urpriz'd when he &s;aw that the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who had got the Letter into his own power, gave it to one of the meane&s;t Officers of his Court, who by the Prime Mini&s;ter's order, gave it to another, and he to a third, who brought it back to the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at length pre|&s;ented it to the King, but not in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Boulaye.</HI></P>
<P>And thus you &s;ee the Effect of the ridiculous pride of the Deputies, <HI>Boulaye</HI> was forc'd to &s;tay in an outer Court, having two more to pa&s;s thorough before he came into the King's Quarter. Where, while he re|main'd big with expectation, word was brought him, that the King would return an An&s;wer to the King his Ma&s;ter, &s;o &s;oon as the Ships &s;hould be arriv'd; and &s;o he was forc'd to go back to his Lodging with the melancholy di&s;&s;atisfaction of a fru&s;trate hope.</P>
<P>The wounded Gentleman being new cur'd, but &s;till very lame, de|&s;ir'd Audience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> that he might have ju&s;tice for the mi&s;|chief done him by an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and a Robbery. The <HI>Nahab</HI> readily admitted him, limping when he came into his pre&s;ence wor&s;e then when he fir&s;t left his bed. The fir&s;t Compliment he made was of the Wounds he had receiv'd, and then he demanded &s;atisfaction for the lo&s;s of his Blood, and the Goods which had bin &s;tolen from him. The <HI>Na|hab</HI> promis'd him to inform the King of the bu&s;ine&s;s, a&s;&s;uring him that he &s;hould have no wrong done him upon the high-way within the Ter|ritories
<PB N="43" REF="500">
where he had to do. Four or five days after, the <HI>Nahab</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Beber</HI> to know how much the Lo&s;s which he pretended to have receiv'd amounted to <HI>Beber</HI> brought in an account of four and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Roupies,</HI> or 12000 Crowns, and for the lo&s;s of his Blood, he left it to the Kings Genero&s;ity.</P>

The <HI>Nahab</HI> replying, that that was contrary to the Cu&s;tom of all Nations, and that he knew it could not be as he &s;aid, added withal, that he &s;hould take no care for his &s;atis|faction in that particular. After that he read on.</P>

<P><HI>Item.</HI> A Chain of Gold valu'd at 500 <HI>Roupies.</HI> In all amounting to 24000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Two or three days after, the King caus'd an Order to be deliver'd to him for the payment of his Money at the Trea&s;ury-Chamber. Upon which Order, he agreed with a Merchant to be paid at <HI>Surat.</HI> And when he was ready to depart, the King commanded 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> to be paid him for the lo&s;s of his Blood. But that &s;um he never receiv'd. For be|ing in ha&s;te to be gone to <HI>Surat,</HI> and failing to pre&s;ent the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> he drill'd him out &s;o long, that his patience was quite tir'd, and &s;o he was forc'd to go without it.</P>
<P>I could never under&s;tand the Policy of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> to pay <HI>Beber</HI> the &s;um which he &s;aid had bin taken from him; when the <HI>Nahab</HI> knew to a thread what he had lo&s;t, and had given in an accompt thereof to the King the whole not amounting to 2000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> And as for the <HI>Fran|guis,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as they under&s;tood that he had demanded 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for his Chirurgeons Che&s;t, they all cry'd out that it was a meer cheat. For a few days before <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> the Chirurgeon had receiv'd 200 <HI>Roupies</HI> by the Charity of the <HI>Franks</HI> to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> and he fell &s;ick the next day that this Bill was pre&s;ented to the <HI>Nahab.</HI></P>
<P>After the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> had read the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter, the <HI>Nahab</HI> by order of his Ma&s;ter, order'd a Lodging to be provided for the Deputies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">joy'd the Je&s;uits, who were by that means rid of two very trouble&s;ome Gue&s;ts As for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> in regard the King had &s;ignifi'd his plea&s;ure, that he would not return any an&s;wer to the King's Letter till the arrival of the Ships, he never troubled him&s;elf any farther, but &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d till the waters were fallen, that he might go to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Golconda</HI> to &s;ettle a Trade in tho&s;e parts.

a hor&s;e, and did nothing but run to and fro, to know the King's plea&s;ure touching the &s;ettlement of Trade. But the <HI>Nahab</HI> either laugh'd at him, or took little notice of what he &s;aid. For indeed by <HI>Beber</HI>'s outward appearance, and deportment, no man could make any other judgment of him, but that he was a poor &s;pirited fellow, and one that knew not what it was to live. For all the <HI>Europeans</HI> that travel into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> are always richly habited, nor would any of them keep <HI>Beber</HI> company, who by his Habit look'd rather like a Footman, than a Depu|ty of a Royal Company of Trade. At length a whim took him to make him&s;elf a &s;uit of painted Calicut, after the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion, the like whereof had never been &s;een in the Country; the whole Suit no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tanding him in above 13 <HI>Livres</HI> and 13 <HI>Sous.</HI> For the trimming of his new Suit he took off the Ribbands of his old Cloaths, which he was two days lathering, and &s;moothing with a Taylers Goo&s;e. When he had got this rare Habit upon his back, he went to vi&s;it the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who was then attended by the Principal Lords of the Court. Who when they &s;aw him enter, fell all a gazing upon him, and ask'd one another whe|ther that <HI>Frangui</HI> were turn'd <HI>Faquir,</HI> or a <HI>Dervich</HI> of <HI>Ho&s;&s;en Mamout,</HI> which they u&s;ually call the ragged <HI>Saint.</HI> For you mu&s;t know, that all the <HI>Faquirs</HI> or <HI>Derviches</HI> that are of this Order, never apparel them&s;elves but with &s;uch rags as they pick up in the &s;treets, and if they meet with any pieces better than other, they make of them a kind of Galoon to trim the re&s;t. They al&s;o carry half Pikes, with a great company of Tatters fa&s;ten'd to the end of them, to make a &s;hew of their beggery. <HI>Be|ber</HI>'s Habit very much &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Nahab,</HI> and all others that beheld him &s;o ridiculou&s;ly accouter'd. As the pa&s;s'd one morning by my win|dow, I bid him good morrow, telling him withal, that he look'd more &s;pruce and gay than he us'd to do. He reply'd, he had rea&s;on &s;o to do, for that he had receiv'd Letters from <HI>Surat,</HI> by which he had advice, that the Country people upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cape St. John</HI> had decry'd four Ve&s;&s;els out at Sea, which they could not make to be either <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders,</HI> from whence he concluded that they were the Companies &s;hips; and that he was going to the <HI>Nahab</HI> with the News. But I pre|vented him at that time, telling him that I had often ob&s;erv'd that ra&s;cally &s;ort of people to come both to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with &s;uch kind of Intelligence, on purpo&s;e to get Money; when indeed they had never &s;een any &s;uch &s;ight, and admoni&s;hing him not to believe Reports upon &s;uch &s;light foundations. I ask'd him what date his Letters bore? he told me, thirty days ago. Then, &s;aid I, if the di&s;covery had bin true, the <HI>Nahab</HI> would have had notice of it in fourteen; and then he would certainly have told you of it, or my &s;elf; for it is but two days &s;ince I took my leave of him. Thereupon he took my coun&s;el and re&s;olv'd for <HI>Surat</HI> in a few days.</P>
<P>Three days after that the Chirurgeon had given in his Bill for the Che&s;t of Medicaments that he had lo&s;t among <HI>Beber</HI>'s Baggage, he was &s;o touch'd in Con&s;cience, that he fell &s;ick, and dy'd in two days. Upon his death-bed he ask'd pardon of God for the Cheat which he had con|&s;ented to, to ask 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for that which was really worth but four hundred; 200 of which he had receiv'd from the Charity of the <HI>Fran|guis,</HI> the re&s;t upon the &s;ale of a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>For my part, finding that <HI>Beber</HI> was re&s;olv'd for <HI>Surat,</HI> I made what ha&s;t I could out of <HI>Agra,</HI> to be quit of his company. But the &s;econd
<PB N="45" REF="501">
day after my departure, having &s;et up my tent by a Rivers &s;ide, ju&s;t as I was going to dinner I &s;py'd <HI>Beber</HI> coming, nor could I get rid of him afterwards till I came to <HI>Surat.</HI> So that we were forc'd to travel toge|ther, though he committed a thou&s;and Impertinencies by the way. Among the re&s;t, he put one trick upon the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> or Bankers at <HI>Brampour,</HI> not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>In regard the ways were bad, and that he had but one pitiful weak Chariot, and four weak Boys, which with the help of Oxen, were hardly &s;trong enough to help him out when he &s;tuck in the mire, he &s;el|dom came to his journeys end till two or three hours after me. Now upon the report that ran of the <HI>French</HI> &s;hips being &s;een out at Sea, and the general belief that <HI>Beber</HI> would be one of the Principal Tru&s;tees of the Company, &s;everal, as I &s;aid before, courted him, and &s;ought to engage his Friend&s;hip. Being arriv'd at <HI>Brampour,</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs,</HI> attended by a dozen of his &s;ervants came to vi&s;it us. Upon the fir&s;t acquaintance <HI>Beber</HI> told him that he wanted a <HI>Pallaquin</HI> to go to <HI>Su|rat,</HI> whereupon the <HI>Cheraff</HI> civilly offered him his, and caus'd it to be trimm'd up for his better accommodation. <HI>Beber</HI> thought that trimming would have bin fini&s;ht in one day, when indeed it requir'd three or four. The next day I order'd my Coach to be got ready, and order'd my <HI>Pal|laquin</HI> to be carri'd away. <HI>Beber,</HI> who verily believ'd that the Compa|ny&punc;s &s;hips were already in the Road of <HI>Surat,</HI> began to cur&s;e and bann the <HI>Cheraff,</HI> who pre&s;ently came to him and endeavour'd to appea&s;e him with good words. He told him, it could be no prejudice to him to &s;tay a day or two; for by that time the Roads would be better, and he might travel the fa&s;ter. But <HI>Beber,</HI> being tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, was &s;o far from taking the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> rea&s;ons for &s;atisfaction, that &s;natching a Cudgel out of his Waggoners hands that &s;tood next to him, he gave the <HI>Cheraff</HI> three or four good Licks cro&s;s the &s;houlders. The Merchants and other people that were in the Inn, were &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd at &s;uch a piece of rudene&s;s, and ran out pre&s;ently, &s;ome with Stones, and others with Cudgels, making a hideous noi&s;e, and crying out, that they had never &s;een the like. They took it for a mo&s;t enormous Crime, to &s;trike the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs,</HI> above four&s;core years old, who&s;e very age ought to have bin protection enough from &s;uch an Affront. Good luck it was for <HI>Beber,</HI> after &s;uch a ra&s;h action committed, that I was well known at <HI>Brampour,</HI> having been there ten or twelve times, and in &s;ome of my Travels having dealt for above 200000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> There were none of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> with whom I had not dealt by Letters of Exchange, and very few Merchants or Brokers who had not had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s or other upon my accompt. They cry'd out, &s;peaking of me; See there the Mon&s;ieur <HI>Franqui,</HI> with whom we have dealt &s;o often, yet never heard him give us an ill word. Another good chance he had to meet there the <HI>Coutevall</HI>'s Lieutenant, and three Merchants of <HI>Surat;</HI> and thus be|tween us, having di&s;ingag'd <HI>Beber</HI> out of the Brabble wherein he had &s;o &s;illily bemir'd him&s;elf, we made him get into my Coach, and &s;o packt him out of the City. I follow'd him two hours after: for had he &s;taid longer in <HI>Brampour,</HI> I believe the <HI>Faquirs</HI> and <HI>Derviches</HI> would have beat out his brains. For he was no &s;ooner gone, but a great number of that &s;ort of rabble came to the Inn, crying out, Where was that Dog of a <HI>Cafer</HI> that had beaten the <HI>Cheraff.</HI> Thereupon, &s;eeing the Multitude encrea&s;e, I &s;tole out of the Town, without &s;aying a word, and rid on
<PB N="46" REF="502">
till I got three leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> to an old Town call'd <HI>Badelpoura,</HI> where I overtook <HI>Beber,</HI> who had hir'd a Coach made after the fa&s;hion of the Country. It was but rea&s;on, that I &s;hould have my own Coach to &s;leep in the night: For though in all places where you come to lye in the night, the <HI>Indians</HI> will offer you a little bed to lye on, yet in re|gard the rains were but ju&s;t over, the bed&s;teads were &s;o full of Punies, that there was no re&s;ting. The&s;e Punies are ingender'd by the moi&s;ture which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ains, that fall for four months together, cau&s;e in tho&s;e Coun|tries. Which being over, and the Sun recovering its wonted heat, the women carry forth their beds every morning, and beating them well with good big &s;ticks, never leave till the Punies fall to the ground, and there turning up their bellies pre&s;ently dye. The&s;e beds con&s;i&s;t of four feet and four round &s;taves, as broad and as long as you plea&s;e. To the &s;taves are fa&s;ten'd girths about four fingers broad, which are much more commodious than the bottoms of our beds that are plank'd with Deal or other wood. Over the girths they only lay a &s;ingle Coverlet or Sheet, which is a manner of lying ea&s;ie enough, con&s;idering the heat of the Country.</P>
<P>The fourth day after our departure from <HI>Brampour,</HI> being near a great Town call'd <HI>Semqueles,</HI> in a flat Country, we perceiv'd all the Plain co|ver'd with Tents. It appear'd to be the Camp of one of the chief <HI>Kans,</HI> or Lords, whom the <HI>Great Mogull</HI> had &s;ent with 50000 men again&s;t the Rebel <HI>Raja Sevagi.</HI> This Lord, under&s;tanding who we were, very ci|villy &s;ent us Melons, and Mango's, and bid his Officers tell us withal, that we were out of all danger, and might &s;afely pur&s;ue our journey. Whatever I could &s;ay to <HI>Beber,</HI> to per&s;wade him that it was but an act of civility and good manners, to wait upon the Prince, I could by no means engage him. I &s;eeing his impertinency, &s;hifted my habit, and &s;ent one of my &s;ervants to the Camp, to learn whether the <HI>Kan</HI> drank Wine; and under&s;tanding that he did, I took a bottle of <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and another of <HI>Schirus</HI> Wine, and a &s;mall pocket Pi&s;tol delicately embel|li&s;h'd with &s;ilver; and with this &s;mall Pre&s;ent away I went to wait upon the General. Being come into his Pre&s;ence, I excus'd <HI>Beber,</HI> as not being well, and immediately pre&s;ented him the little Pi&s;tol, which he took, and bid me charge, being de&s;irous to try it. After he had &s;hot it off, &s;aid he to his Lords that &s;tood by, Now mu&s;t we confe&s;s the&s;e <HI>Fran|qui's</HI> to be ingenious. This man &s;ees that I am going to the Wars, and pre&s;ents me wherewithal to defend my life. Then ca&s;ting his eyes upon the little Hamper, where the Bottles were, he ask'd what it was? They told him in his Ear. Oh, &s;aid he, looking at the &s;ame time upon two or three <HI>Mim Bachi's,</HI> or Colonels that were pre&s;ent, This <HI>Franqui</HI> Gentleman has given me a bottle of Wine, well we mu&s;t drink it, for I find I &s;hall plea&s;e him in &s;o doing. When the <HI>Mollah's</HI> heard him talk of Wine, they &s;lunk away; which made the <HI>Kan</HI> laugh heartily. The&s;e are <HI>Agi's,</HI> quoth he; they have bin Pilgrims to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and never drink Wine after they come home again. Having taken my leave, he &s;ent me a <HI>Pomere,</HI> which is a kind of Scarf that may al&s;o &s;erve for a Girdle. It was made of white Sattin with flow'rs of Gold, and might be worth about a hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI> He that brought it, told me, I &s;hould do the <HI>Kan</HI> a great kindne&s;s, to &s;end him another bottle of Wine: thereupon I &s;ent him two or three, which was all my &s;tore. He &s;ent me &s;ix Hor&s;emen to conduct us three days journey, till we had pa&s;s'd a
<PB N="47" REF="502">
great River that flows from the Mountains of the South, which wa&s;h|ing the City of <HI>Baroche,</HI> from whence it takes its Name, falls into the Bay of <HI>Cambay.</HI></P>
<P>When we came to our la&s;t &s;tage, which is a great Town, call'd <HI>Bar|noli,</HI> from whence it is but 14 Leagues to <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> &s;ent one of his Hirelings to give notice thereof to Father <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI> When the News came, the Father went with the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant, often already men|tion'd, to borrow the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident's Coaches: and there were about 15 or 16 more Coaches all in a train, with &s;everal Hor&s;emen and Mer|chant <HI>Banians</HI> that made ha&s;t to meet the Deputy. This happen'd upon the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> 1666. They carri'd with them Provi&s;ion enough to make merry, and every <HI>Banian</HI> had his Pre&s;ent ready. For my part, I as &s;oon as I had &s;aluted the Father Capuchin, <HI>I</HI> went directly to my Lodging, where I had left two Servants to take care of a Sum of Money which I had receiv'd of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> unwilling to hazard it upon the Road. For in whatever part of the <HI>Indies</HI> I came, I had credit enough to buy without Money. I only gave my Bills for payment at <HI>Agra, Vi&s;apour, Golconda,</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> where I generally left my Money, as having receiv'd it there for the mo&s;t part of the Lords or Kings of the Country.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Beber,</HI> he was no Changeling, the follies that he committed are too numerous to be related: but how he began the year 1667, is not to be omitted.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> upon his return from <HI>Madra&s;patan</HI> and <HI>Golconda,</HI> lodg'd in the Capuchins hou&s;e. <HI>Beber</HI> going to vi&s;it him, told him, that the Capuchins were the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Spies, and that he had often advis'd Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> to break with them, and not to go any more to their Hou&s;e. That while he frequented their Society, the <HI>French</HI> Company would be &s;ure to find &s;ome ob&s;tacle in their Trade when the Ships &s;hould arrive; and that if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had not been at <HI>Agra,</HI> they might have done what they pleas'd with the King. That the hundred thou&s;and <HI>Roupies</HI> which they had pre&s;ented to the King and Grandees of the Court, had hinder'd them from obtaining what they de&s;ign'd. By which it appear'd, he under&s;tood not the humour of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> for they are not &s;o liberal: nor would all their tricks, or pre&s;ents have any thing avail'd them, the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> being de&s;irous that all Nations &s;hould be welcome to his Dominions, e&s;pecially Merchants, as well they that import little, as they that bring in much. M. <HI>Thevenot</HI> told him, that he had never ob&s;erv'd &s;o much of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in all his travels; for if it were true, that they had &s;uch a de&s;ire to hinder the Trade of other Nations, they would not afford them pa&s;&s;age in their Ships, or to put their Goods aboard, as they often did. Moreover, they &s;end away many times one or two Ships according to the quantity, laden all with &s;tran|gers Goods, from <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> in which Ships, there is not oft|times &s;o much as one Bale belonging to the Company. And this, added he, is farther ob&s;ervable, That they afford their Freight cheaper then the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or any other Nation, who have Ships in the&s;e parts. Thus Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> endeavour'd to convince M. <HI>Beber;</HI> who would have had Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> have fallen out with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But he knew better things then to di&s;oblige per&s;ons to whom he was &s;o much behold|ing as he was every day. For every week they allow'd the hou&s;e a certain quantity of Bread and Meat, and upon Fa&s;t-days &s;ent them Fi&s;h,
<PB N="48" REF="503">
Eggs, Brandy, and Wine, which were no &s;uch unkindne&s;&s;&eacute;s to be quarrell'd with. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> at the &s;ame time told <HI>Beber,</HI> that he &s;hould do well to repay Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> the Money which he had borrow'd to pay for the Coach which he had broken to &s;erve him, as al&s;o that which he had given the Seamen, for trying if they could di&s;cover the <HI>Companies</HI> Ve&s;&s;els upon the Coa&s;t. But he turn'd his deaf ear to that di&s;cour&s;e, and would never be per&s;uaded to reimbur&s;e the Money which Father <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> laid out for him. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> perceiving his unwillingne&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ing him to do things hand&s;omly, put him into &s;uch a chafe, that he fell a &s;wearing after &s;uch a violent rate, in a Parlour, that was parted only by a thin board from the place where the Ma&s;s was &s;aid, that one of the Fryers, ju&s;t ready to go to the Altar, came forth to de&s;ire him to leave his bla&s;pheming. But <HI>Beber</HI>'s in&s;olence took his admonition &s;o ill, that he very rudely beat the Fryer in Mr. <HI>The|venot</HI>'s pre&s;ence; &s;wearing, That had it not been out of re&s;pect to him, he would have knockt him o' the head. The Capuchin being &s;o inju|riou&s;ly us'd, came to Me, being hardly able to &s;tir his neck, by rea&s;on of one of the blows that <HI>Beber</HI> had given him. I chaft his neck with Oyl of Coco's, and wrapt it up warm: but we dur&s;t not &s;peak a word of <HI>Beber</HI>'s idle action, for fear of expo&s;ing our &s;elves to the laughter of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who would have made good &s;port with it. Be&s;ides the&s;e Enormities, he put away his Servant that had &s;av'd his Life, and kept his Wages. After that he went to lye at an Apothe|caries hou&s;e, who&s;e Name was <HI>Mouillon,</HI> who came from <HI>Goa,</HI> with a good quantity of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, and kept a Tavern at <HI>Surat.</HI> While he lay there he had a great Conte&s;t with the Merchant, who receiv'd the 24000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> which the King had given him for the lo&s;s which he alleadg'd that he and his Chyrurgeon had &s;u&s;tain'd. For the Merchant would acknowledge the receipt of no more then 23900 <HI>Roupies,</HI> the other Hundred being deducted for Fees of the Trea&s;ury. He al&s;o main|tain'd, That the Merchant had receiv'd the 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which the King had allow'd him for the lo&s;s of his Blood: but it was known that the Grand Trea&s;urer would never pay that Money. Thus when he &s;aw that his Cheats were di&s;cover'd to all the World, he began to bethink him|&s;elf how to get away: and we ob&s;erv'd, that he would fain have quitted <HI>Surat</HI> without noi&s;e. But there is &s;uch good Order taken both by Land and Sea, that no per&s;on can go away without the knowledge and leave of the Governour. For as the Countrymen that come from the other &s;ide of the water cannot return unle&s;s they &s;hew a mark in their hands made with red Earth at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; neither Hor&s;e nor Coach can &s;tir without a Note from the <HI>Chabander,</HI> and another for the <HI>Ra|dars,</HI> who lye &s;ometimes two or three Leagues from the Town. <HI>Beber</HI> neverthele&s;s had &s;ome a&s;&s;urance from his Vintner, that he might get into a Boat, by bidding the Boatmen carry him to <HI>Reynel,</HI> a large Town on the other &s;ide of the water. The Ma&s;ter of the Boat ask'd him for his Ticket, but <HI>Beber</HI> an&s;wer'd him with his Cudgel, forcing him for|ward, and telling him, he was not to demand Billets of &s;uch a per&s;on as he was. As he was got half way the River a great number of Souldiers hollow'd after the Boatmen, to row the Strangers back a&s;hoar. But <HI>Beber</HI> laid his hand upon his Sword, and compell'd the Boatmen to go forward. That evening, <HI>Beber</HI> being return'd, the poor Boatmen were apprehended, and ba&s;tinado'd till they were almo&s;t maim'd. The
<PB N="49" REF="503">
people cri'd out, that it was the <HI>Frangui</HI> that ought to be &s;o &s;erv'd, and not the poor Watermen, who had done nothing but by con&s;traint.</P>
<P>Thus did this Envoy behave him&s;elf both in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> to the great hindrance of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. Now let us &s;ee what became of both <HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> after all their Extravagancies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sieur de la Boulaye,</HI> according to the accompt given by the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> that were at <HI>Agra,</HI> left the Town five or &s;ix days after my departure. Knowing I went to <HI>Surat,</HI> he had plaid his game &s;o well with me, that he got a Hamper of twelve large bottles of Wine for 138 <HI>Roupies,</HI> though they co&s;t me more, for which he gave me a Note of his hand, that I have &s;till in my cu&s;tody, to be paid at <HI>Surat,</HI> upon the arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Companies &s;hips. From thence he travell'd to <HI>Patna,</HI> where he &s;taid nine or ten days, partly with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> partly with the <HI>Hollan|ders:</HI> from whence he departed for <HI>Daca,</HI> the Re&s;idence of the Governour of the Province. The Governour of the Province of <HI>Bengale</HI> was then the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Uncle, who&s;e name was <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan,</HI> a potent Prince, who has always under his Command thirty or forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>At <HI>Patna, Boulaye</HI> had a project, that from thence he might ea&s;ily pa&s;s into <HI>China,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e he there embarqu'd with &s;ome <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Souldiers, who were going to li&s;t them&s;elves under <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan.</HI> But after that, to this hour, it never could be certainly known what became of him: but by all probable conjectures, it is verily believ'd, that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Souldiers murder'd him and his little Slave, in hopes of &s;ome good booty. Of the truth whereof, the Ob&s;ervation that follows was no &s;mall evidence. About a quarter of a mile from <HI>Daca</HI> lies a Town, where live &s;everal mungrel <HI>Portugal</HI> Officers, belonging to the Gover|nour of <HI>Bengale,</HI> as Canoneers and Carpenters, and &s;ome of the &s;ame Nation that &s;erve in the Cavalry of <HI>Cha-E&s;t-Kan.</HI> There they have al&s;o a &s;mall Church very well built, where an <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> Fryar officiates, to whom, about three months after <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s departure from <HI>Patna,</HI> a cer|tain <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> in the Habit of a Souldier, with two more companions, brought two large Books, the one in <HI>Folio,</HI> and the other in <HI>Quarto</HI> to &s;ell. The Fryer, who was a mungrel al&s;o, under&s;tood no <HI>Latin;</HI> but finding them not to be in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language, would have &s;topp'd the Books as &s;toln from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had not the Souldier been too &s;trong for him. The&s;e Books were thought to have been <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s; who, to my knowledge, had two Che&s;ts full, well bound; in reading whereof he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time. His Avarice was his Ruine; for had he taken a Bark by him&s;elf, as I did when I went from <HI>Patna,</HI> and had oblig'd the Watermen to give him good &s;ecurity, he could have run no hazard. For my part I took one with four and twenty men; and every one, knowing I never &s;par'd for co&s;t, gave me excellent &s;ecurity. The&s;e Barks are little Galliots, which will undertake to carry you to your journey's end, and name your own day. If you will lye a&s;hoar every evening, they will &s;et up your Tents; and &s;top at any Town or City to take in Provi&s;ions. I never made &s;o plea&s;ant a Voy|age in my life, nor with le&s;s trouble. For in the&s;e Barks, there is a Room where the Sun cannot come in, where you may repo&s;e in the day time, and &s;it in the cool Air on that &s;ide from whence the Breez comes. There is another place cover'd for your Kitchin; and another little Garderobe for the private deeds of Nature. By the way I kill'd great
<PB N="50" REF="504">
&s;tore of large Gee&s;e, Cranes, and Crocodiles, which I gave the Water|men, who were very glad of them; for they &s;old them in the Towns as they row'd along. The people in tho&s;e quarters are very good natur'd and officious. Dyet is little worth, as being the place where you may buy a hundred Pullets for a Crown: and for three or four Pence, you may buy a Fi&s;h of a prodigious length and bigne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Beber</HI>'s end was no le&s;s &s;ad. For when the <HI>French</HI> Companies Ships were arriv'd, M. <HI>Caron,</HI> who commanded them, and M. <HI>Rambos,</HI> with an <HI>Armenian,</HI> who had the management of the chiefe&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, had been acquainted with what had pa&s;s'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> between <HI>Beber</HI> and the Capuchins. Pre&s;ently Affections and Intere&s;ts parted. <HI>Caron</HI> and <HI>Rambos</HI> took <HI>Beber</HI>'s part; the <HI>Armenian</HI> held for the Capuchins, which was at length the ruin of <HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos.</HI> The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander going aboard to vi&s;it the Sieur <HI>Caron,</HI> upon his return would not permit the Captain to &s;tir out of his Cabin, &s;o that <HI>Rambos</HI> and the <HI>Armenian</HI> took upon them to wait upon the Commander. Upon this Occa&s;ion the <HI>Armenian</HI> took upon him to precede <HI>Rambos,</HI> and briskly threw him|&s;elf before the <HI>French</HI>-man; who being provok'd at the Affront, gave the <HI>Armenian</HI> a &s;winging cuff o' the Ear before all the company. To be &s;hort, the Sieur <HI>Caron, Rambos,</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> holding all together, the <HI>Ar|menian</HI> found him&s;elf too weak to re&s;i&s;t: and in regard he had the Management of the Ca&s;h, he was accus'd of Misbehaviour, and was condemn'd to be hang'd. But becau&s;e they could not execute the Sen|tence which they had given at <HI>Surat,</HI> they &s;ent him away to the Council Royal of the I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> of which M. <HI>Mondevergue</HI> was chief; who was &s;o far from confirming the Sentence given at <HI>Surat,</HI> that he admitted the <HI>Armenian</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf; and finding that he was not only innocent, but that he might be very u&s;eful to the Company, he &s;ent him back to <HI>Surat</HI> with more power then he had before. This put <HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos</HI> into a fit of De&s;pair, to &s;ee the per&s;on whom they thought to have ruin'd, now above them. Thereupon they found a way to get 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> a piece for their Wages, which they pretended to be due from the Company: and with that and 24000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which <HI>Beber</HI> had of his own they Embarqu'd both together for <HI>Goa.</HI> Where, being arriv'd, <HI>Beber</HI> dy'd &s;oon after: But as for <HI>Rambos,</HI> he return'd home again through <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE TRADE OF THE EAST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>_THat Nation which has a de&s;ign to &s;ettle a Trade in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ure in the fir&s;t place, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a convenient place in that Country, to carine their Ships, and &s;helter them&s;elves during the tempe&s;tuous Sea&s;ons. This want of a good Haven is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have not made tho&s;e advan|tages which otherwi&s;e they might have done; becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould remain in tho&s;e Seas without being carin'd, or el&s;e eaten by the worms.</P>
<P>Therefore, becau&s;e it is a long way from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> it would be requi&s;ite to have a retreating place at the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> to take in fre&s;h Water and Provi&s;ions, whether going or coming; but e&s;pecially in their return, in regard that the Ships being then laden, can|not take in Water for any long time.</P>
<P>The Road of the I&s;land of <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have built a Fort, is a very commodious place: and if the Water be not &s;o good upon the North-&s;ide, yet the Plain is an excellent &s;pot of Ground to &s;ow, with convenience of all things nece&s;&s;ary for human &s;upport.</P>
<P>This advantage the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have depriv'd all other Nations of, by their Forts upon the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> and <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s. And there|fore &s;ome River's mouth, near the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> ought to be fought for, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which would be far more convenient then the <HI>Dauphin I&s;land,</HI> where there is no Trade but that of buying Cattel for their Hides; which being a Trade of &s;o little con&s;equence, would ruin a Company to follow it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I make this Propo&s;al is, becau&s;e that in the year 1648, two <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;els being bound from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and re&s;olving to touch at the <HI>Cape,</HI> to take in fre&s;h Water, mi&s;took their ju&s;t Depths, &s;o that the Sea running high, they fell into a Bay, 18 or 20 Leagues from the <HI>Cape,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t that looks to the We&s;t. In that

Bay they found a River, who&s;e Water was very good; and the Blacks of the Country brought them Refre&s;hments of all &s;orts of Fowl, Fi&s;h, and Bullock's fle&s;h. There they &s;taid above 15 days, and before they &s;et &s;ail, they took two of the <HI>Negro's,</HI> which they carri'd along with them to <HI>Goa,</HI> to teach them the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language; on purpo&s;e to try if they could di&s;cover by them any knowledge of the Trade of the Country. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander at <HI>Surat</HI> de&s;ir'd me, to inform my &s;elf, when I went to <HI>Goa,</HI> what the <HI>Portugals</HI> had learnt from tho&s;e two <HI>Negro's.</HI> But one <HI>St. Amand,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ingeneer, who was Supervi&s;or of the Fortifications of <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, That he could not make them learn one word of the Language; and that he could only gue&s;s by their &s;igns, that they had &s;ome knowledge of <HI>Ambergreece</HI> and <HI>Elephants Teeth.</HI> The <HI>Portugals</HI> however made no que&s;tion but to meet with Gold, if they could find a way to trade higher up i' the Country. The Revolutions of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and their Wars with <HI>Spain</HI> have hinder'd them from making any more particular di&s;covery of the Coa&s;t. Which it were to be wi&s;h'd the <HI>French</HI> would undertake, provided they gave no cau&s;e of jealou&s;ie to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of what they were going about.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t having the liberty of &s;ome place near <HI>Surat,</HI> to ride &s;afe in, and to wa&s;h and tallow in, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;taid by the Rain-Sea&s;ons. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that during that ill &s;ea&s;on, at what time it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep the Seas, the <HI>Mogul</HI> jealous of his Fortre&s;s of <HI>Surat</HI> &s;uffers no Foreign Ve&s;&s;el in the River, where neverthele&s;s, the Ships being unladen, may ride &s;ecurely from the terrible Tempe&s;ts that la&s;t for five Months.</P>
<P>The only &s;ecure place for the Companies Ve&s;&s;els would be the Town of <HI>Dia,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>The advantage of the &s;ituation is con&s;iderable for &s;everal rea&s;ons. The circuit of the City contains almo&s;t 400 Hou&s;es, and might be capable to receive a greater number of people, where the Ships would find all conveniencies during their &s;tay. It is &s;eated upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> upon a point of the Gulph of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> looking toward the South-ea&s;t. The form of it is almo&s;t round; and above half the Circle environ'd by the Sea. It is not commanded by any Hill; and the <HI>Por|tugals</HI> have begun tho&s;e Fortifications, which might be ea&s;ily fini&s;h'd. It contains &s;everal Wells of very good Water, and a River which falls into the Sea near the City, who&s;e Water is better then that of <HI>Surat,</HI> or <HI>Souali,</HI> and the Harbour is very commodious for Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals,</HI> when they had fir&s;t &s;ettl'd them&s;elves in the <HI>Indies,</HI> kept there a Fleet compos'd of Galleys, Brigantines, and other light Ve&s;&s;els, whereby they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, for a long time, of all the Trade of the Places we have treated of. So that no Ship could trade, without the Governour of <HI>Dia</HI>'s Pa&s;sport, who made it in the Name of the Viceroy that liv'd at <HI>Goa.</HI> The Impo&s;ition, which the Ships paid, was &s;ufficient to maintain the Fleet and Garri&s;on, and to enrich the Go|vernour be&s;ides.</P>
<P>When the Rain-Sea&s;ons are over, that the wind &s;its at North and North-ea&s;t, you may &s;ail from <HI>Dia</HI> to <HI>Surat</HI> in three or four Tides with light Ve&s;&s;els; but great Ships that are laden mu&s;t fetch a compa&s;s about the Bank.</P>
<P>The City has no Land belonging to it, but what it &s;tands upon, yet it would be no difficult thing to agree with the <HI>Raja,</HI> or Govervour of
<PB N="53" REF="505">
the Province, and to obtain as much as &s;hould be &s;ufficient for the Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Neither is the Land about it very fertile, and be&s;ides, the people are the poore&s;t in the whole Empire of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the Country is &s;o well &s;tor'd with Cattel, that an Ox or a <HI>Bufalo</HI> will not co&s;t above two <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> make u&s;e of the&s;e Cattel to feed their People, and to &s;pare the Provi&s;ions of their Ships, while they &s;tay at <HI>Souali.</HI></P>
<P>But it is ob&s;ervable that the <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s fle&s;h in tho&s;e parts cau&s;es frequent Dy&s;enteries, which the Bullocks fle&s;h or Beef never does.</P>
<P>The <HI>Raja</HI> that commands the Country has only the Title of Governour for life. Which is common to mo&s;t of the <HI>Raja's</HI> in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Em|pire, who&s;e Ance&s;tours were Lords of Provinces, where now their De&s;cendants only enjoy the Titles of Governours.</P>
<P>Having thus got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good Po&s;t; the next thing of Impor|tance is to choo&s;e out two men con&s;iderable for their Hone&s;ty, Prudence, and Skill in Trade, who are to be allow'd the full of their Expences.</P>
<P>The&s;e two per&s;ons are to &s;erve the Company, the one in the nature of a Pre&s;ident, with a Council, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of per&s;ons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The other in the quality of a Broker, who mu&s;t be an Idolater of the Country, and not a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> in regard all the Work|men he has to deal with are Idolaters.</P>
<P>Civility and Faith of Promi&s;e are altogether requi&s;it to gain Credit among &s;trangers. And the&s;e particular qualities are requir'd in the particular Broakers, who are under the Broaker-General in the Pro|vinces where the Factories are &s;ettl'd.</P>
<P>Good Intelligence is nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e two per&s;ons, to under&s;tand the alteration of Manufactures.</P>
<P>This alteration happens either through the craft and &s;ubtilty of the Workmen and the Merchants them&s;elves, or by the corre&s;pondence of the Broakers and Workmen.</P>
<P>Which alteration may cau&s;e &s;o much dammage to the Company, that the Broakers &s;hall gain ten and twelve i' the hundred by it.</P>
<P>If the Pre&s;ident and Broaker-General combine with the particular Broakers and Merchants, it will be a difficult thing for the Company to avoid being deceiv'd; but if the&s;e two per&s;ons are but faithful and hone&s;t, the fraud may be ea&s;ily remedi'd by changing the particular Broakers.</P>
<P>The Officers of a Company may be unfaithful to their Tru&s;t in this re&s;pect:</P>
<P>When a Ve&s;&s;el arrives in Port, the Pre&s;ident for the Nation receives the Company's Letters, and the Bills of Lading; upon which he calls his Council, &s;ends for the Broaker, and gives him a Copy of the &s;aid Bills.</P>
<P>The Broaker &s;hews them to three or four of the principal Merchants of the Country, who are wont to buy by whole &s;ale. If the Pre&s;ident and the Broaker hold together for their own profit, the Broaker in&s;tead of facilitating the &s;ale as he ought to do, advi&s;es the Merchants to be &s;hie, and to offer only &s;uch a price: Then the Pre&s;ident &s;ends for the Broaker and the&s;e two or three Merchants; and in the pre&s;ence of the Council he asks the Merchants what they will give for the Goods in the Bills of Lading mention'd. If the Merchants are re&s;olute to give
<PB N="54" REF="506">
no more then &s;o much; The Pre&s;ident puts off the &s;ale 15 days longer, more or le&s;s, as he pretends him&s;elf pre&s;s'd to &s;ell. In the mean time he &s;ends for the Merchants &s;everal times for a &s;hew, and at length, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, and to di&s;charge him&s;elf, he asks the advice of the Council, and as they approve, orders the delivery of the Goods to the Merchant.</P>
<P>But though the Temptations be very great, to which the&s;e two Offi|cers are &s;ubject, by rea&s;on of their pow'r, their frequent opportunities, and their di&s;tance from their Superiours, the Company, be&s;ides their being wary in their Election, may remedy the&s;e di&s;orders by depriving them of that pretence, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commanders and Broakers have, of being con&s;train'd to &s;ell off pre&s;ently to the Merchants in gro&s;s, to avoid the expences of delay.</P>
<P>The Errour which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> commit in this re&s;pect is, That their Officers be&s;peak every year upon Credit all the Goods which they have occa&s;ion for in the Empire of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> according to the Orders which they receive from <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The credit of this Advance co&s;ts them &s;ometimes twelve, &s;ometimes fifteen <HI>per Cent;</HI> &s;o that &s;o &s;oon as their laden Ve&s;&s;els are arriv'd in the the Port where they are to be &s;old, they are oblig'd to &s;ell them pre&s;ently off at the Merchants rate fir&s;t offer'd to their Broakers, to make up a pre&s;ent &s;tock to pay off their credit for the Goods be&s;poke for their Ships to carry back again, and to get more credit for the next year. This is that which cheri&s;hes that confederacy between the Pre&s;ident, the Broaker and the Merchant, who makes advantage enough of this nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling.</P>
<P>Whereas the better way were, for them that carry the &s;ame Commo|dities which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do, to carry Money al&s;o to pay the Work|men for the Goods be&s;poken for the next year.</P>
<P>The Company making this advantage &s;hall not be put to pay that great Intere&s;t of 12 and 15 <HI>per Cent.:</HI> and be&s;ides, they &s;hall have better Goods, and better cheap. The Ships loading &s;hall be ready before they arrive in Port; and being quick laden they may return before the bad Sea&s;on. Neither &s;hall the Company be put to &s;ell their Goods at a low price; becau&s;e their Broakers will have time to &s;tay for the coming of Merchants from other parts; or el&s;e becau&s;e they have time enough to &s;end them to other places, where they are &s;ure of a quicker &s;ale.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve al&s;o, That it is far more profitable to carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> Gold and Silver in Ingots, rather then ready coin'd; for being coin'd the Money is valu'd only according to their Alloys; and there is always a defalcation made for the charge of Coinage.</P>
<P>The Broaker al&s;o, if he be di&s;hone&s;t, may combine with the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Mint, which is &s;ettl'd in &s;everal parts of the Empire, and put a lower value upon the Gold and Silver then it de&s;erves, by telling the Pre&s;ident and Council, that upon the touch it appears to be no more worth.</P>
<P>But it is an ea&s;ie thing to avoid this deceit, provided the Pre&s;ident be a per&s;on of credit and prudence, by &s;ending for one of the Refiners of Gold and Silver, that live in the Country, who perfectly under&s;tand the Touch of Metals, and to let him E&s;&s;ay the Gold and Silver before the Broaker's face.</P>
<P>This is that which the Sieur <HI>Walkenton</HI> did for the <HI>Holland</HI> Company
<PB N="55" REF="506">
in their Factory at <HI>Ca&s;ambazar,</HI> where he bought every year &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and Bales of Silk. For by this E&s;&s;ay he found, that his Broaker being in confederacy with the Ma&s;ter of the Mint, had cheated the Company of one and a half and two <HI>per Cent;</HI> in the value of the Gold and Silver which was brought him from <HI>Japan,</HI> as well coin'd as in barr, to a very con&s;iderable &s;um of Money.</P>
<P>The Broaker al&s;o may confederate with the Ma&s;ter of the Mint to couzen the Merchant in weghing his Gold or Silver, by making u&s;e of fal&s;e Weights or Scales unduly pois'd.</P>
<P>But that fraud is ea&s;ily avoided, if the Pre&s;ident and his Council will be but &s;o patient as to &s;ee their Metal weigh'd them&s;elves, and take care that the Weights be right, and the Scales true.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t important Ob&s;ervations in reference to the Trade of the Company, and di&s;cipline of their Factories is this:</P>
<P>To prevent the Merchants or under-Merchants, Accomptants and under-Accomptants, who officiate under the Commanders and Broakers, from driving any particular Trade by them&s;elves, for they having a familiarity with the men of Manufacture, and finding by the Letters of Advice what Goods are likely to be mo&s;t vendible next year, buy them up upon their own accompts, and find a way to lade them off in the Com|pany's Ve&s;&s;els, to the great dammage of the whole, though to the great gain of particular people.</P>
<P>And this the Pre&s;ident permits them to do, either for his own In|tere&s;t, or by connivance under the pretence of their &s;mall Wages. The Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el al&s;o winks at what they do, becau&s;e he has a &s;pell for loading and unloading. And becau&s;e the&s;e people having no great Stocks, are de&s;irous to put off their Goods with the fir&s;t opportunities, they give order to their Corre&s;pondents to under-&s;ell the Company ten or twelve in the Hundred, which is the ab&s;olute ruin of a Trade.</P>
<P>To remedy this di&s;order there ought to be a Fi&s;cal, or King's Proctor, in every of the chief Factories belonging to the Company, to act in the King's Name, and by his Authority.</P>
<P>He is to be independent from the Pre&s;ident and the Broaker, in the Exerci&s;e of his Office; &s;o that he may have an eye, as well upon their behaviour, as upon the demeanour of the under Officers.</P>
<P>He ought to be a per&s;on of good Credit, re&s;olute and vigilant; and he mu&s;t have a &s;trength of men corre&s;pondent to his Employment, and a Deputy to act under him.</P>
<P>He is to have good Information of the departure of all Ships when they are once laden, and when they are ready to &s;et &s;ail for the Port whither they are bound. When he hears of the Arrival of any Ship, he ought to go him&s;elf, or &s;end his Deputy with a &s;ufficient Guard, to take an Accompt of the Ship's Lading.</P>
<P>If it be a place near to which there are any &s;mall I&s;lands, or by-Nooks, it behoves him to take care that no Goods be privately convey'd a&s;hoar in tho&s;e private corners, where there are receivers a now ready: and whatever he finds thus privately unladen he &s;hall have power to con|fi&s;cate.</P>
<P>He &s;hall al&s;o confi&s;cate whatever he finds not Mark'd with the Com|pany's Mark.</P>
<P>He may al&s;o di&s;charge any inferiour Officers to whom any &s;uch Bales
<PB N="56" REF="507">
&s;hall belong; and for the &s;uperiour Officers, he &s;hall complain of them to the Company.</P>
<P>He &s;hall have pow'r to open all private Letters, to inform him&s;elf of Prohibited Goods, and Private Corre&s;pondencies.</P>
<P>This Prohibition of Private Trading cannot be too &s;everely impos'd, and it is ob&s;erv'd with &s;o much exactne&s;s in <HI>Holland,</HI> that when one of the Company's Ships is ready to &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a Burgoma&s;ter gives the Captain and all the re&s;t of the Seamen their Oaths, that they &s;hall be contented with their Wages, and meddle with nothing of Trade.</P>
<P>All the Officers of the Factory &s;hould be advanc'd by degrees, &s;o that a &s;ub-Accomptant may have hopes to be a Pre&s;ident; that the hopes of Ad|vancement may oblige them to live with more credit, and cau&s;e them to &s;tudy to make them&s;elves more capable of all the Intrigues and Subtilties of the Trade of the Country.</P>
<P>It is of great importance not to &s;hew any favour in this particular of preferment, unle&s;s he have pa&s;s'd through all particular Degrees and Offices beforehand. And thus much concerning the Di&s;cipline of the Factories.</P>

<P><HI>INdigo</HI> comes from &s;everal parts of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Empire; and according to the diver&s;ity of the places it differs in quality, and con|&s;equently in price.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it comes from the Territories of <HI>Biana, Indouae,</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;a,</HI> a day or two's journey from <HI>Agra:</HI> which is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t of all.

There is al&s;o <HI>Indigo</HI> little inferior in goodne&s;s and price, which comes from the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Territories. The <HI>Mein</HI> of <HI>Surat,</HI> which contains 42 <HI>Serre's,</HI> or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu'd from 15 to 20 <HI>Roupies.</HI> They make as good as this at <HI>Baroche.</HI> That which is made up about <HI>Agra</HI> is made up in half Balls, and is the mo&s;t &s;ought for in all <HI>India.</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="509">
It is &s;old by the <HI>Mein,</HI> which in tho&s;e places contains 60 <HI>Serres,</HI> or 51 and three quarters of our pounds. The u&s;ual price is from 36 to 40 <HI>Roupies.</HI> There grows al&s;o <HI>Indigo</HI> &s;ome 36 leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> about a great Village call'd <HI>Raout,</HI> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the road to <HI>Surat:</HI> Of which the Natives u&s;ually make above a hunder'd-thou&s;and <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P>There comes <HI>Indigo</HI> al&s;o from <HI>Bengala,</HI> which the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company tran&s;ports for <HI>Ma&s;lipatan.</HI> But they buy this <HI>Indigo,</HI> and that of <HI>Brampour</HI> and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, then that of <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is made of an Herb which they &s;ow every year after the rains are over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it three times a year; fir&s;t when it is about two or three foot high; and they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the fir&s;t cutting far exceeds the two latter. The &s;econd cutting is wor&s;e then the fir&s;t by ten or twelve in the hunder'd. And the third wor&s;e then the &s;econd by 12 in the hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Pa&s;te, and ob&s;erving the colour. The colour of that <HI>Indigo</HI> which is made of the fir&s;t cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others: and that which is made of the &s;econd is more lively then the third.</P>
<P>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they make with Lime, which becomes &s;o hard, that you would judg it to be one intire piece of Marble. They are generally four&s;core or a hunder'd paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up with the Herb. Then they brui&s;e and jumble it in the water till the leaf, for the &s;talk is worth nothing, becomes like a kind of thick mud. This being done, they let it &s;ettle for &s;ome days; and when the &s;etling is all at the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When the water is all drain'd out, they fill &s;everal baskets with this &s;lime, and in a plain Field you &s;hall &s;ee &s;everal men at work, every one at his own basket, making up little pieces of <HI>Ind&icirc;go</HI> flat at the bottom, at the top &s;harp like an egg. Though at <HI>Amadabat</HI> they make their pieces quite flat like a &s;mall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Mer|chants, becau&s;e they would not pay cu&s;tom for an unnece&s;&s;ary weight, before they tran&s;port their <HI>Indigo</HI> out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> are very careful to cau&s;e it to be &s;ifted, to &s;eparate the du&s;t from it; which they &s;ell afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They that &s;ift this <HI>Indigo</HI> mu&s;t be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath before their faces, and that their no&s;trils be well-&s;topt, leaving only two little holes for their eyes. Be&s;ides, they mu&s;t every half hour be &s;ure to drink milk, which is a great pre&s;ervative again&s;t the piercing quality of the du&s;t. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this caution, they that have &s;ifted <HI>Indigo</HI> for nine or ten days, &s;hall &s;pit nothing but blew for a good while toge|ther. Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the &s;i&s;ters, and when I came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</P>
<P>As they take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes, they lay them in the Sun to dry. Which is the rea&s;on that when the Merchants buy <HI>Indigo,</HI> they burn &s;ome pieces of it, to try whether there be any du&s;t among it. For the Natives who take the Pa&s;te out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps, lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Pa&s;te, and &s;ouls it. But when the Merchants burn it, the <HI>Indigo</HI> turns to A&s;hes, and the Sand remains. The Governours do what they can to make the Natives leave their

<HEAD>Spice.</HEAD>
<P>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves and Cinnamon, are all the different &s;orts of Spices known to us. I put Cardamom and Ginger in the fir&s;t place, becau&s;e that Cardamom grows in the Territories of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and Ginger in the Dominions of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other Foreign parts to <HI>Surat,</HI> which is the grand Mart.</P>
<P>Cardamom is the mo&s;t excellent of all other Spices, but it is very &s;carce; and in regard there is no great &s;tore in the place where it grows, it is only made u&s;e of in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> at the Tables of great Princes. Five hundred pound of Cardamoms, are pric'd from a hundred to a hundred and ten Rials.</P>
<P>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where there grows more than in any other part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and it is hardly to be imagin'd how much there is tran&s;ported candited into Foreign parts.</P>
<P>Pepper is of two &s;orts. There is a &s;ort which is very &s;mall, another &s;ort much bigger; both which &s;orts are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into &s;mall and great Pepper. The larger &s;ort comes from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavare;</HI> and <HI>Tuti|corin</HI> and <HI>Calicut</HI> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> being vended at <HI>Rejapour,</HI> a little City in that Kingdom. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that purcha&s;e it of the <HI>Malavares,</HI> do not give Money for it, but &s;everal &s;orts of Commo|dities in Exchange; as Cotten, Opium, Vermilion, and Quick&s;ilver; and this is the Pepper which is brought into <HI>Europe.</HI> As for the little Pepper that comes from <HI>Bantam, Afchen,</HI> and &s;ome other parts toward the Ea&s;t, there is none of it carried out of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where it is &s;pent in va&s;t quantities, e&s;pecially among the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> For there are double the Grains of &s;mall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; be&s;ides that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</P>
<P>The little Pepper that comes to <HI>Surat,</HI> has been &s;old &s;ome years for thirteen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and &s;o much I have &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> give for it, to tran&s;port it to <HI>Ormus, Bal&s;ara,</HI> and the Red Sea. As for the great Pepper, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fetch from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malavare,</HI> five hundred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty|eight Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they gain <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the only Spices which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in their own hands. The three fir&s;t come from the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="510">
'Tis ob&s;ervable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never planted, which has been confirm'd to me by &s;everal per&s;ons that have liv'd &s;everal years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nut|meg being ripe, &s;everal Birds come from the I&s;lands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be dige&s;ted. The Nutmeg then be&s;mear'd with a vi&s;cous matter, falling to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one ob&s;ervation upon the Birds of Paradi&s;e. The&s;e Birds being very greedy after Nut|megs, come in flights to gorge them&s;elves with the plea&s;ing Spice, at the &s;ea&s;on, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the &s;trength of the Nutmeg &s;o intoxicates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the Emets in a &s;hort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds of Paradi&s;e are &s;aid to have no Feet; which is not true however, for I have &s;een three or four that had Feet; and a <HI>French</HI> Merchant &s;ent one from <HI>Aleppo</HI> as a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Projects, you may buy Cloves at <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> without purcha&s;ing them of the <HI>Hollander;</HI> in regard the I&s;lan|ders buy them of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains and Soldiers, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in tho&s;e places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange Rice, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;upport of life, without which they would &s;tarve, being very &s;adly provided for.</P>
<P>When the Natives of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> are thus furni&s;h'd of Cloves, they barter them in Exchange for &s;uch Commodities as are brought them; &s;ome|times they give Tortoi&s;e-Shells in exchange, and Gold Du&s;t; by which the Merchant gains &s;ix or &s;even in the hundred, being better than the Money of the I&s;land, though it be Gold, by rea&s;on the King oft|times enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are <HI>Amboyna, Ellias, Seram,</HI> and <HI>Bouro.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;lands of <HI>Banda</HI> al&s;o, in number &s;ix, <HI>viz. Nero, Lontour, Poulcay, Ro&s;eguin,</HI> and <HI>Grenapuis,</HI> bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The I&s;land of <HI>Grenapuis</HI> is about &s;ix Leagues in compa&s;s, and ends in a &s;harp point, where there is a continual fire burning out of the earth. The I&s;land <HI>Damme,</HI> where there grows great &s;tore of Nutmegs, and very big, was di&s;cover'd in the year 1647, by <HI>Abel Ta&s;man,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>The Price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them &s;old to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Surat,</HI> was as follows.</P>
<P>The Mein of <HI>Surat</HI> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of our Pounds, at &s;ixteen Ounces to the Pound.</P>
<P>A Mein of Cloves was &s;old for a hundred and three Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>A Mein of Mace was &s;old for a hundred and fifty-&s;even Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>Nutmegs for fifty-&s;ix Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>Cinnamon comes at pre&s;ent from the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> The Tree that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They never take off but the fir&s;t and &s;econd, which is accounted the be&s;t. They never meddle with the third, for &s;hould the Knife enter that, the Tree would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they learn from their youth. The Cinnamon Spice is much dearer to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> then people think; for the King of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd
<PB N="63" REF="510">
King of <HI>Candy,</HI> from the name of his principal City, being a &s;worn Enemy to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;ends his Forces with an intention to &s;urprize them, when they gather their Cinnamon; &s;o that they are forc'd to bring &s;even or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <HI>Portugals</HI> were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all con&s;um'd. When it was cold, the upper part became a Pa&s;te like white Wax; of which they made Tapers to &s;et up in their Churches, for no &s;ooner were the Tapers lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd. Formerly the <HI>Portugals</HI> brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the <HI>Raja's</HI> about <HI>Cochin.</HI> But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have de&s;troy'd all tho&s;e places, &s;o that the Cinnamon is now in their hands.

The finene&s;s is di&s;cern'd by the eye, the length and breadth by the mea&s;ure. But the <HI>Indians</HI> practi&s;e a more cunning way, which is to count the number of threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the finene&s;s of the &s;cantling. When the number fails, it is either more tran&s;parent, more narrow, or more cour&s;e. The difference is &s;ometimes &s;o difficult to be perceiv'd, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great deal. For it is nothing to cou&s;en a Crown or two Crowns in a piece that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Tho&s;e that whiten the&s;e Calicuts, to &s;ave charges of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts exce&s;&s;ively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and lowers the price.</P>

<P>THe cheat in the weight is twofold. The fir&s;t, by laying them in a moi&s;t place; and thru&s;ting in the middle of every Skain &s;ome thing to add to the weight. The &s;econd; in not giving good weight when the Broaker receives it from the Workm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, or Merchant that delivers it.</P>
<P>There is but one cheat in the quality, that is by putting three or four Skains, of a coar&s;er Commodity then that which is uppermo&s;t, into one <HI>Mein.</HI> Which in a great quantity mount&punc; high; for there are &s;ome Cottons that are worth an hunder'd Crowns the <HI>Mein.</HI> The&s;e two cheats
<PB N="66" REF="512">
being often us'd by the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, there is no way but to weigh your Commodity in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Commander, and his Councel, and to examin every <HI>Mein</HI> Skain by Skain. When this is done, they who are order'd to be at his examination, are oblig'd to fix to every Bale a ticket of the weight and quality: for if there be a faileur, they who fix the ticket are engag'd to make good what is wanting.</P>

<HEAD>Deceits in Indigo.</HEAD>
<P>I Have told you, that when the Work-men have made up the Indigo-Pa&s;te int <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">umps, with their fingers dipt in Oil, they lay them in the Sun a drying. Now tho&s;e that have a de&s;ign to cheat the Merchants, dry them in the &s;and, to the end that the &s;and &s;ticking to the Indigo, &s;hould encrea&s;e the weight. Sometimes they lay up their Pa&s;te in moi&s;t places, which makes it give, and con&s;equently renders it more heavy. But if the Governour of the place di&s;covers the cheat, he makes them &s;everely pay for it: and the be&s;t way of di&s;covery is to burn &s;ome pieces of Indigo, for the &s;and will remain.</P>

<HEAD>Indian Broakers.</HEAD>
<P>THe Broakers are as it were the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indian</HI> Families; for they have all Goods at their di&s;po&s;al. The Work-men choo&s;e the mo&s;t aged and mo&s;t experienc'd, who are to endeavour equal advantages for the whole Tribe they undertake for. Every evening that they return from their bu&s;ine&s;s, and that, according to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who make no Suppers, they have eaten &s;ome little piece of &s;weet-meat, and drank a gla&s;s of water, the elde&s;t of the Tribe meet at the Broaker's Hou&s;e, who gives them an account of what he has done that day, and then they con&s;ult what he is to do next. Above all things, they caution him to look to his hits, and to cheat, rather then be cheated.</P>
