<HEAD>A Strange Apparition or Vi&s;ion &s;eene to appeare at <HI>Medina Talnabi</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> where <HI>Mahomet</HI> their great Prophet was buried.</HEAD>
<P>_THere came Newes to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> of a &s;trange Apparition or Vi&s;ion, which was &s;eene at <HI>Me|dina Talnabi</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> whereas <HI>Mahomet</HI> their great Prophet was buried: To vi&s;it who&s;e Tombe the <HI>Turkes</HI> v&s;e to goe in Pilgrimage, but they mu&s;t fir&s;t goe to <HI>Mecha,</HI> which is &s;ome few dayes Journey off, and there they take a ticket from the Grand Seigiours Beglerbeg, el&s;e they are not al|lowed to goe to Medina.</P>
<P>This Vi&s;ion continued three weekes together, which terrified the whole Country, for that no man could di&s;cover the truth thereof.</P>
<P>About the 20. of <HI>September,</HI> there fell &s;o great a Tempe&s;t, and &s;o fearefull a Thunder about mid|night, as the Heavens were darkned, and tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="3"> that were awake were almo&s;t di&s;tracted, but the vapours being di&s;per&s;t, and the Element cleere, the People might read in Arabian Characters, the&s;e words in the Firmament, <HI>O why will you beleeve in Lies,</HI> betweene two and three in the morning, there was &s;eene a woman in white, compa&s;&s;ed about with the Sun, having a cheerfull countenance, holding in her hand a Book, comming from the Northea&s;t, op|po&s;ite again&s;t her were Armies of <HI>Turkes, Per&s;ians, Arabians,</HI> and other <HI>Mahometans,</HI> ranged in or|der of Battaile, and ready to charge her, but &s;hee kept her &s;tanding, and onely opened the Booke, at the &s;ight whereof the Armies fled, and pre&s;ently all the Lamps about <HI>Mahomets</HI> Tombe went out, for as &s;oone as ever the Vi&s;ion vani&s;hed (which was commonly an houre before Sunne ri&s;ing) a mur|muring Wind was heard, whereunto they impu|ted the extingui&s;hing of the Lamps. The antient Pilgrims of Mahomets Race, who after they have vi&s;ited this place, never u&s;e to cut their haire, were much amazed, for that they could not conceive he meaning of this Vi&s;ion, onely one of the <HI>Dervices,</HI> which is a &s;trict religious Order among the <HI>Turkes,</HI> like unto the Cappuchins among&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and live in contemplation, &s;tepped up very boldly and made a Speech unto the Company which incen|&s;ed them much again&s;t him, &s;o as the poore Prie&s;t for his plain dealing lo&s;t his life, as you &s;hall here|after heare.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Dervice</HI> Speech unto the <HI>Turkes.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THe</HI> Dervice <HI>his Speech was this:</HI> That the VVorld had never but three true Religions, e|very one of which had a Prophet; fir&s;t, God tho&s;e the Iewes, and did wonders for them in Aegypt, and brought them forth by their Prophet <HI>Mo&s;es, who</HI> pre&s;cribed them a Law, wherein he would have main|tained them if they had not beene ob&s;tinate and Re|bellious, and fallen to Idolatry; whereupon hee gave them over, and &s;cattered them upon the face of the Earth. Then pre&s;ently be rai&s;ed a new Prophet who taught the Chri&s;tian Religion. This good man the Iewes condemned and crucified for a &s;educer of the peo|ple, not moved with the Piety of his life, his great Miracles nor his Doctrine. Yet after his death, the Preaching of a few Fi&s;hermen did &s;o move the hearts of men, as the greate&s;t Monarches of the World bowed to his very title, and yeelded to the command of his Mini&s;ters. But it &s;eemes they grew as corrupt as the <HI>Iewes,</HI> their Church being di&s;membred with the di|&s;tinction of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t,</HI> committing Idolatry againe by &s;etting up of Images, with many other idle Ceremonies, be&s;ides the corruption of their lives, &s;o as God was weary of them too, and not onely &s;ent Divi&s;i|ons among them, but for&s;ooke them, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them of their chiefe&s;t Cities, <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI></P>

<P>Yet God is &s;till the governour of the World, and provides him&s;elfe of another Prophet and People, ray|&s;ing our great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and giving Way to our Nation, &s;o as no doubt we &s;hall be happy forever, if we can &s;erve this God aright, and take example by the fall of others, but alas, I tremble to &s;peake it, wee have erred in every point, and wilfully broken our fir&s;t In&s;titutions, &s;o as God hath manife&s;ted his wrath by evident &s;ignes and tokens, keeping our Prophet from us who prefixed a time to returne withall happine&s;se to his People, &s;o as there is now forty yeares pa&s;t by our accompt, wherefore this &s;trange and fearefull vi&s;ion is a predic|tion of &s;ome great troubles and alterations, for either the opening this Booke in the womans hand, doth fore|tell our falling away from the fir&s;t intent of our Law, whereat the&s;e armed men, departed as confoun|ded with the guilt of their owne Con&s;ciences, or el&s;e it &s;ignifies &s;ome other Booke, wherein we have not yet read, and again&s;t which no power &s;hall prevaile, &s;o as I feare our Religion will be corrupt, and our Prophet an impo&s;ter, and then this <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> whom they talke of &s;hall &s;hine like the Sunne, and &s;et vp his name ever|la&s;tingly.</P>
<P><HI>Hitherto the Company were &s;ilent, but hearing him &s;peake &s;o boldly, they charged him with</HI> Bla&s;phemy, <HI>and knowing their Law, which makes all bla&s;phemy capitall, they pre&s;ently condemned him, and having the</HI> Beglerbegs <HI>con&s;ent, and war|rant to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they immediately put him to death.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<P><HI>As their rage again&s;t him was violent, &s;o their execution was extraordinary, for they neither cut off his head, nor &s;trangled him, as they u&s;ually doe to malefactors, but they tortured him by degrees, for &s;tripping him fir&s;t naked, they gave him a hun|dred blowes on the &s;oles of his feet with a flat Cud|gell, untill the blood i&s;&s;ued forth, the poore Prie&s;t crying continually on the Woman that opened the Booke. After which they tooke a Bulls pizzell and beat all his body untill the &s;inewes crack't, and in the end they layd him upon a Wheele, and with an Indian Sword made of Sinewes, they brake his bones to pieces, the poore man crying to the la&s;t ga&s;pe,</HI> O thou VVoman with the Booke &s;ave me, <HI>and &s;o he dyed. At which time there was a feare|full Tempe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whereupon the Beglerbeg &s;ent certaine Saphies to the Port of</HI> Sidon <HI>to imbarke for</HI> Con&s;tantinople <HI>to the end they might adverti&s;e the Emperour of the&s;e Tydings.</HI></P>
