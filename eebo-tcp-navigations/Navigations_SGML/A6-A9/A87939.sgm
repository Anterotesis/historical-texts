<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Doubt not but the news of the Armies comming down again&s;t Am&s;terdam; hath by this time di&s;per&s;ed it &s;elf throughout Europe, but the occa&s;i|on and the tran&s;actions between the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Citizens may be worthy of your ob&s;ervation, viz. The Prince having a high di&s;|plea&s;ure
<PB N="2" REF="3">and indgnation again&s;t the Magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam contrived away whereby he intended to &s;urprize this rich &amp; famous City by a &s;tratagem, and to effect this de&s;ign without giving cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion what his intent was, He ordred Grave <HI>William</HI> of Na&s;&s;aw to empty all frontier Garri&s;ons, upon pre|tence of conveying the old Prince of Orange in|to Germany, and to be ready at the &s;ame time with his hor&s;e to enter the City, which was contri|ved to be done on Saturday the thirty of July about 3 or 4 in the morning at the opening of the Gates; for effecting of which de&s;ign with the more certainty and &s;ecrecie, about two hundred foot &s;ouldiers were put privately into &s;everal Turf boats, which were to come up to the City at the &s;ame time by water, and lying undi&s;covered, were to fall in at the very &s;ame in&s;tant when the hor&s;e &s;hould enter the gates, and &s;urprize the Guard at the Regulaters high-way, which being done, he thought good to make the City with|out any re&s;i&s;tance. But &s;o it was, that when the Plot was almo&s;t ready to be put in execution, it plea&s;ed God to di&s;appoint al their purpo&s;es, partly by rea&s;on of the great rain which fell all Friday (July 29.) in the afternoon, and all the &s;ame night, which made the ways very deep and rotten; &s;o that the Prince his hor&s;e having a long march, of four and twenty miles ty|red.</P>
<P>Then they turned to a City about ten miles off, but the Citizens refu&s;ed to pa&s;&s;e through or let them in, in regard they knew not what they were; where|upon they were forced to march another way, which was to their great di&s;advantage, and that nigh
<PB N="3" REF="3">being very dark, and wanting good guides, they mi&s;|took their way, which hindred them above three hours time, by rea&s;on whereof they could not get unto Am&s;terdam before nine of the clock on Sa|turday, which was &s;ix houres after the time appoint|ed to enter the City, &s;o that before they got thither, their de&s;ign was di&s;covered to the Magi&s;trates, by the Po&s;t of Hambrough, who accidentally fel mong&s;t the hor&s;e, when they were doubtfull of their way, which made his company very acceptable to them, in regard they might make u&s;e of him to be their guide, but when he perceived their de&s;ign, he &s;tole away from them and ha&s;ted to Am&s;terdam, and made known to the Magi&s;trates, what he had learned by riding a while among&s;t their troops.</P>
<P>Grave <HI>William</HI> perceiving that Providence fought again&s;t him (to the lo&s;&s;e of the time appointed, and be&s;t opportunity) was filled with di&s;content, and quartered his Forces at Over-Qirtie, which is three miles from the City, attending there to re|ceive further Orders from the Prince of Orange, who was at the Hague, and had there impri&s;o|ned many publique per&s;ons that were &s;ent from Dort, Horten, Delf, and other places, and &s;o confi|dent was he, that the de&s;ign on which he had &s;ent Grave <HI>William,</HI> would take effect, that he told the impri&s;oned with his own mouth, Am&s;terdam was his own, but immediately after news was brought him to the contrary, which &s;o much &s;tartled him that its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, he took his hat, threw it one the ground, and &s;et his feet upon it. When his heat of pa&s;&s;ion was over, he ha&s;ted away and on Sunday came to
<PB N="4" REF="4">Grave <HI>William,</HI> but his comming was to little pur|po&s;e, for &s;o &s;oon as the Magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, received the information from the Po&s;t at Hambo|rough as afore&s;aid, they cau&s;ed all the gates of the City to be &s;hut up, and the booms to be lockt, which are as &s;o many gates by water, and put all the City-Garri&s;on into arms, with their muskets ready char|ged with bullet, They al&s;o cau&s;ed &s;everall Bra&s;&s;e Guns to be mounted on their works, and &s;ent many ve&s;&s;els well man'd and provided to lie upon Sin&s;ter, which is an inland River, and &s;ome men of war rode at Anchor upon the Tij, which is an arm of the Sea, So that good guards were quickly placed about the City, both by land and water, and the apparence of men in their Arms was the more &s;peedier for that at the beat of Drum they were commanded forth in the name of the Magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, which was a thing not u&s;uall.</P>
<P>The city being in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence, Grave <HI>William</HI> moved the Prince to block up the city at a di|&s;tance on the South &s;ide of <HI>Tij,</HI> conceiving that if they could keep provi&s;ions from it, in time he &s;hould ob|tain his De&s;ires. But the Magi&s;trates wi&s;ely fore&s;ee|ing the danger, cau&s;ed all the Sluces to be opened, on Sunday about noon, it plea&s;ed God a little before to turn the wind Northwe&s;t, which u&s;ually brings in much water; by this means all the low grounds for many miles without Am&s;terdam lay under water in &s;hort time, &s;o that the Princes hor&s;es could have no gra&s;&s;e, nor make nearer approaches, unle&s;&s;e upon banks, where above three a bre&s;t could not march
<PB N="5" REF="4">and then it mu&s;t have been upon the mouth of the cannon: hereupon on &s;unday the Prince &s;ent a Trum|peter into the city, and 4 of the Cities Councel was &s;ent to the Prince at &s;everal times, on Munday, Tue&s;|day, and Wedne&s;day, and &s;tayed all Tue&s;day and Wedne&s;day night with him; in all which time &s;eve|ral other me&s;&s;engers came from him to the Magi|&s;trates. During all the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;everal Let|ters came from the mo&s;t eminent towns in Holland, and from Utritch to the Magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, certifying their di&s;like of the Princes proceedings, and &s;everal other Magi&s;trates came al&s;o in per&s;on, af|firming the &s;ame, which much encouraged the City, and di&s;heartned the Prince, who on Wedne&s;day was commanded by the States General (as is reported) to appear pre&s;ently in the Hague, and in four and twenty hours to cau&s;e all the Forces to repair to their &s;everal Garri&s;ons; and to that end on Thur&s;|day morning as &s;oon as the day appeared, he remo|ved from before Am&s;terdam, at which there was no &s;mall rejoycing. During the Prince his ab&s;ence from the Hague, there hath been mutenies, and the inhabi|tants would have plundered the Princes Court.</P>
<P>Thus you have a Relation of the 5 days blocking up of the famous City of Am&s;terdam, who in the Hague (no doubt) will pro&s;ecute the chief authors of this de&s;ign, of which more hereafter.</P>
