<HEAD><HI>A True Narrative of a Wonderful Accident, which occur'd upon the Execution of a</HI> Chri&s;tian Slave <HI>at</HI> Aleppo <HI>in</HI> Turky.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough I am none of tho&s;e men of ea&s;ie Faith, which (either through want of Capacity to judg of, or want of due Indu&s;try to inquire into things) are apt to credit all Reports: and though po&s;&s;ibly there are few men have a greater aver&s;ion to encourage Super&s;tition than I have; Yet I confe&s;s I do not think my &s;elf oblig'd to deny my a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e things my &s;ences inform me of; though I cannot pre&s;ently &s;atisfie my &s;elf of the true cau&s;es which produce their <HI>Phoenomina,</HI> or ap|pearances: for I have learn'd to know thus much, That there are many things we know not: And for my part, I look up|on that man as a very fal&s;e conceited per&s;on, that dare deny matter of fact, only becau&s;e he is unacquainted with the cau|&s;es from whence &s;uch or &s;uch an effect is produced.</P>
<P>Nay, I will go yet farther, and venture to &s;ay, That if I receive a relation of a thing from a Per&s;on, or Per&s;ons, of who&s;e Candor and Truth I have no rea&s;on to doubt; and if I am fully &s;atisfied (upon a wary in&s;pection) that &s;uch a worthy Per&s;on can have no intere&s;t to lead him to impo&s;e upon me: And if the &s;ame thing, with the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, be atte&s;ted to me by many &s;uch free and unintere&s;ted Per&s;ons, and that at &s;everal times, and unknowing to each other, and all this without the lea&s;t variation: I then conceive I have the greate&s;t humane probability imaginable for the giving an Hi&s;torical Faith to &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>And this &s;ecurity any man may have (if he que&s;tion the truth of the &s;ucceeding Relation) by going to <HI>Elford's Coffee-Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>George-yard</HI> in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> where he may meet with &s;everal Eminent and Worthy Gentlemen (<HI>Turky</HI>-Mer|chants), that can confirm the truth of the thing, they having
<PB N="2" REF="3">been at the place where this was acted, and at the &s;ame time when it was done.</P>
<P>I make this Apology, becau&s;e the Reader may &s;atisfie him&s;elf of the truth of the en&s;uing Story, and not be apt to think he is impo&s;ed upon by the Authors of the I&s;land of <HI>Pines,</HI> or <HI>O Brazil.</HI></P>
<P>Some few years &s;ince, there happened an In&s;urrection or Tumult of &s;ome of the <HI>Turks</HI> which dwelt in the City of <HI>A|leppo;</HI> which being ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> ne|verthele&s;s &s;ent thither a <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> to enquire out the Malefa|ctors, and &s;ee ju&s;tice done upon them: in the Execution of which, the <HI>Turks</HI> are very &s;evere (the Con&s;titution of their Government obliging them to be &s;o). Upon the approach of the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> all the <HI>Turks</HI> of quality in <HI>Aleppo</HI> went out &s;ome Leagues or Miles to reverence the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> and conduct him in triumphant manner to the City: And upon this occa&s;ion they were attended by the greate&s;t part of their Slaves, the better to expre&s;s their Grandeur and Quality.</P>
<P>Upon this Affair it was, That the Hou&s;e of one of the mo&s;t magnificent <HI>Turks</HI> of that City, was left that day without any other Per&s;on in it, but only the Turks Steward, and a hand&s;om <HI>French Slave,</HI> a young man of eighteen years old: This Turk's Steward, being much addicted to that horrid and unnatural &s;in (too frequent with the <HI>Mahumetans</HI>) <HI>So|domy;</HI> and having ca&s;t his lu&s;tful Eyes upon this Youth, and con&s;idered the fitne&s;s of the time (the Hou&s;e being empty) to act his Villanous de&s;ign: He had in pur&s;uance of his intent, got this <HI>Slave</HI> into a Chamber; where ha|ving locked the Door upon him, to hinder his making an E&s;cape, He at fir&s;t began to make promi&s;es, and to flatter the <HI>Slave,</HI> if by that means po&s;&s;ibly he might prevail with him to con&s;ent to his (more than Bruti&s;h) Devilli&s;h de|&s;ires: but finding the <HI>Slave</HI> of a &s;etled and &s;evere Virtue, he quickly perceived there was no hopes of accompli&s;hing his helli&s;h De&s;ires that way, and therefore had took up a re|&s;olution to pollute the cha&s;t Youth by force; when the <HI>Slave</HI> perceived this, he begg'd, he pray'd, he demon&s;trated the im|po&s;&s;ibility of his a&s;&s;enting to &s;uch a Crime: But all this made no other impre&s;&s;ions upon the vile Turk, but to add pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="3" REF="3">and Fury to his Lu&s;t: in&s;omuch, that he &s;wore deeply, he would give him immediate Death, if he di&s;puted any longer, and did not pre&s;ently &s;ubmit to his accur&s;ed Will. The virtuous <HI>Slave</HI> abhorring this ba&s;ene&s;s with all his Soul, and finding him&s;elf de&s;titute of all other Remedies, nimbly &s;ei|zed upon a Cymeter which hung upon the wall of the Cham|ber, and at one blow with it, &s;mote off the Turks head.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;ie for any one who is unacquainted with the Cruel and Tyrannical nature of the Turks, to make a true e&s;timate of the mi&s;erable and deplorable Condition this ac|cident had put this Generous Slave into: Death was the lea&s;t thing he could expect (and I believe the lea&s;t thing he feared): for it is very u&s;ual with the Turks, upon much &s;lighter faults (than this &s;eemed to be in their e&s;teem) to devi&s;e long-la&s;ting and inexpre&s;&s;ive Torments to inflict up|on their Slaves: which being fore&s;een by this unfortunate Youth, he immediately ca&s;t about by what means to make his e&s;cape; he had heard that three&s;core Miles di&s;tance from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> there was another Engli&s;h Factory (of <HI>Turky</HI> Mer|chants) call'd <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> whither, if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to get, he rationally &s;uppos'd that he might be &s;ecur'd; and by being put aboard an Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;el, be by that means carried out of the Turks Dominions.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this, he went to his Ma&s;ter's Stable, where finding an <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;e, he pre&s;ently mounted the back of him, and convey'd him&s;elf out of the City: which was not difficult for him to do at that time, the place being empty of people upon the fore&s;aid occa&s;ion. But he being totally ig|norant of the way he was to take, (having never been per|mitted all the time of his abode there to go out of the City) and not daring to enquire it for fear of betraying him&s;elf; by a Capri&s;e of ill Fortune, he happened to go the very &s;ame Road that his Ma&s;ter and the other Citizens of <HI>Aleppo</HI> (at|tending upon the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI>) were returning homeward by. His Ma&s;ter and he were both &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of each other: and the Turk ha&s;tily demanding the occa&s;ion of his coming thither (whether it were the &s;urpri&s;e, and fear he was in, or his mode&s;ty which might make him loath to di&s;|cover (before &s;o much company) the truth of that &s;hame|ful
<PB N="4" REF="4">attempt upon him, which cau&s;ed him to make an e&s;cape I know not; &s;o it was, that) he an&s;wer'd his Ma&s;ter, That Thieves had broken into his Hou&s;e and kill'd his Steward, and that he having got out of a Window, had run to the Stable, and mounted that Hor&s;e to come and give him notice.</P>
<P>The Turk &s;eem'd to be &s;atisfied with this account at pre|&s;ent, and commanded the Slave to joyn the Troop of tho&s;e which were upon their return to the City: which he was nece&s;&s;itated to do.</P>
<P>When they were come to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the cunning Turk exa|min'd his Hou&s;e, and found indeed his Steward kill'd, but when he perceived nothing was taken out of the Hou&s;e, he pre&s;ently concluded no Thieves had been there: and there|fore charg'd the <HI>French</HI> Slave with the death of his Steward, which he frankly confe&s;s'd, with a full account of what you have heard.</P>
<P>The Turk then carried this Slave before the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> de&s;i|ring ju&s;tice might be done upon him for the death of his Steward: But when the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> had carefully examined the matter, he was convinced of the truth of the Slaves relation; and being willing to deter the Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> from that ba&s;e &s;in of <HI>Sodomy,</HI> he acquitted the Youth of puni&s;hment. But the Turks being un&s;atisfied with this Sentence, apply them&s;elves again, and in a body, to the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> demon&s;trating the ill con&s;equences of his merciful Sentence, and the un&s;ecure e&s;tate it would reduce them all to, in giving encouragement to their Slaves to murther them: And begging, That though it were true which the Slave alledged, (which yet they de|ny'd, averring he murdred the Steward only that he might make his e&s;cape) that the Slave might be executed for an Example to others, which upon their importunity was at la&s;t granted them by the <HI>Ba&s;haw;</HI> and his former merciful Sen|tence revoked: but yet he would not &s;uffer him to have any other death than beheading.</P>
<P>The Slave then was brought to the place of Execution (which is a Field without the City); where being come, he appeared, though very mode&s;t, yet undaunted, and fearle&s;s of Death. And having pray'd with much fervour and devo|tion, and having particularly acknowledg'd his fault, and
<PB N="5" REF="4">begg' Almighty Gods pardon for telling his Ma&s;ter that pa&s;|&s;age (about robbing his Hou&s;e) when he met him upon the Road; he was &s;trip'd &s;tark naked (according to the cu&s;tom of that place) and di&s;covered a lovely body, in which in|habited a more lovely Soul. And immediately before his death he did aver, That he died a Chri&s;tian, depending whol|ly for his Salvation upon the merits of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and that he kill'd the Steward for no other rea&s;on but to avoid being polluted by him; and that he hoped God would &s;hew &s;ome &s;ign upon his Body to atte&s;t his Innocency, and the truth of what he &s;aid. After having &s;aid this, his Head was &s;truck off by the Executioner, and his Body and Head left in the Field unburied, according to the cu&s;tom of the place.</P>
<P>It happened that there were executed at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame place, &s;everal rebellious Turks, who&s;e Bo|dies were quickly torn in pieces, and devour'd by a certain &s;ort of great Dogs, kept there at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who are allow'd almo&s;t no other &s;u&s;tenance but the Carca&s;&s;es of Malefactors. But it was ob&s;erv'd, that none of the&s;e Dogs would touch the Body or Head of this <HI>Martyr</HI> of <HI>Cha&s;tity.</HI></P>
<P>It may be here objected, That this was a meer Accident, and that the Dogs bellies being fill'd, and &s;atiated with eat|ing the Carca&s;&s;es of the other Malefactors, they forbore to touch this Youth for that cau&s;e, and no other.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That it was ob&s;erved, fir&s;t, That the Body of this Young man lay in the Field unburied, for the &s;pace of ten or twelve days, in all which time there was no other Executions, and the Dogs were &s;o extreamly pinch'd with hunger, that they were ready to devour living men, who had much difficulty to keep them&s;elves from being attack'd by them; and yet would they not touch this Carca&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is remarkable, That the Body of this Young man remain'd all this time expo&s;ed to the heat of the Sun, (which in that Climate is very intemperate), and yet it did neither &s;tink, corrupt, nor (which is &s;omewhat odd) did it change its colour, but remain'd as fre&s;h and vivid, as if he had been but a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Some may, to &s;olve this, and take off the wonder, &s;ay, This proceeded from a peculiar and Bal&s;amick con&s;titution
<PB N="6" REF="5">of Body: But &s;uppo&s;ing this, The Youth was plump, juicy, of a good habit of Body, and what then &s;hould hinder the Dogs to feed upon him, when they were pre&s;s'd by extream hunger? And this Circum&s;tance is very well worth our Re|mark, That after ten days, there being another Execution in the &s;ame place, That Carca&s;s was immediately devour'd in the &s;ight of the People.</P>
<P>I will not &s;tifly affirm all this is Miraculous; though I know Gods hand is not &s;horten'd: and though he &s;eldom &s;tops or turns the cour&s;e of Nature, yet he can do it when he plea&s;eth: And upon this occa&s;ion, here was a con&s;iderable Motive for God to exert His power, to illu&s;trate the Inno|cency and Virtue of a devout and Cha&s;t Chri&s;tian, and that in a place where the Enemies of Chri&s;t Reign, and de&s;pi&s;e his Doctrine, and per&s;ecute the Profe&s;&s;ors of it. But Preaching being none of my employment, I &s;hall forbear, and leave e|very man to abound in his own &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I will end this Di&s;cour&s;e with only &s;aying this, What Sentiments &s;ome Chri&s;tians may have upon reading this Hi|&s;tory, I know not; but this I am a&s;&s;ur'd of, That the &s;ight of the thing was &s;o convincive and operative upon the Turks, That to bury their &s;hame, they were nece&s;&s;itated at la&s;t to dig a Grave, and intomb this Cha&s;t Martyr.</P>
<P><HI>I have now in compliance to your de&s;ires committed the true Narrative of this Hi&s;tory into your hands, which you are per|mitted to di&s;po&s;e of as you think fit.</HI></P>
