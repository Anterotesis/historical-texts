<P>AS Raine from the <HI>Firmament</HI> is drawne from the Sea, and other waters and vapours of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>Ayre,</HI> by the vigour of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> whereby Rivers &s;pring and overflow Gra&s;&s;e, Groves, Fruits encrea&s;e, fi&s;hes multiplie, bea&s;ts and cattell breede and waxe fat, Corne plentifulls, Butter and Chee&s;e in abun|dance, and all other ble&s;sings for the life of man or bea&s;t is nouri&s;hed with milke of Heaven (as raine may ju&s;tly be called) So Navigable Rivers are the Cheri|&s;hing veines of the body of every Countrey, King|dome, and Nation: And as the veines of man doth di&s;till &s;upporting &s;u&s;tinence, to every part and mem|ber of his Body; &s;o doe pa&s;&s;able Rivers convey all manner of commodities from place to place, to the benefit of all and every place in every Countrey and Teritorie.</P>
<P>My &s;elfe bearing a naturall affection to Portable Rivers, and a &s;etled inclination and de&s;ire of the pre|&s;ervation and u&s;e of them, did for the &s;ame intent e|&s;pecially lately pa&s;&s;e with a &s;mall Scullers boate into five great Rivers of this Kingdome; for the which in|tent, (to beare charges) I procured divers of my friends to &s;ub&s;cribe to &s;everall Bills, for them to pay
<PB REF="6">me &s;ome &s;everall &s;mall &s;ummes of money, upon my delivery to each of them a booke at my returue of the pa&s;&s;ages and entertainements which I had in my journey; which booke this is, which you are now reading, and how I pa&s;t out and came backe againe, with many occurrences that happened I have truely related as followeth.</P>
<P>On the twentieth day of <HI>Iuly</HI> la&s;t, 1641. (the &s;econd day of the dogged Dogdayes (I with my two men and a brace of boyes were embarqued with a Scul|lers boate fir&s;t from <HI>London,</HI> and within halfe a quar|ter of an houre after, I pa&s;t from my hou&s;e neare the Beares Colledge on the Banck&s;ide, I tooke leave of &s;ome friends, and had a flagge advanced as a token of my publike departure; but &s;ome enemies gave out that I was Runne away, who I doe know (&s;ince my re|turne,) to be a crew of malicious <HI>Vermin,</HI> (that &s;till being the mo&s;t auntient name of their Captaine and leader,) on the day affore&s;aid with many &s;tops, &s;tayes, and taking leaves, wee gat to <HI>Oatlands</HI> at night, and lodged at <HI>Weybridge</HI> at the &s;igne of the &s;ixe <HI>Ankers.</HI> The next day, being wendne&s;day I &s;trived again&s;t the &s;treame as farre as <HI>Great Marlow,</HI> in <HI>Bucking ham&s;hire,</HI> where I Lodg'd at the &s;igne of the Crowne. Thur&s;e|day the 22. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> I pa&s;t (with much toyle) from <HI>Marlow</HI> to <HI>Goring;</HI> and the next day I came to <HI>Abing|ton.</HI> If it be demanded why I was &s;o may dayes in pa&s;|&s;ing 130 miles, I an&s;wer that the River (by rea&s;on of a great drought) wanted water in may places, &s;o that wee were forc'd to wade, and leade or hale the boate
<PB REF="7">divers times, and moreover we did pull the &s;aid Boate over or thorough 14. Locks, be&s;ides many other im|pediments, which hindred our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>As farre as above <HI>Stanes</HI> (which is forty miles by water from <HI>London,</HI> The River <HI>Thames</HI> is by the care and providence of the Lord Mayor well con&s;erved and kept from impediments of Stops, Weares, Sand beds and other hindrances of pa&s;&s;ages of eyther Boates or Barges, and from <HI>Stanes</HI> to the furthe&s;t part almo&s;t there is no &s;toppage (but only Weares, which Weares have Lockes to open and &s;hut for the pa&s;|&s;ing to and fro of all manner of ve&s;&s;ells (pa&s;&s;able tho|rough from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford;</HI> betwixt which Cities the Barges doe draw up nineteene of tho&s;e Lockes with engines (like Cap&s;tanes) which are called <HI>Crabbs.</HI> I doe relate this heare, becau&s;e the Reader may by that which followeth under&s;tand, that though Weares be nece&s;&s;ary in Rivers, yet they ought not to &s;top up all pa&s;&s;ages, but to &s;uffer Lockes to be opened and &s;hut as <HI>Thames</HI> hath.</P>
<P>Thur&s;eday the twenty &s;eaven, I pa&s;&s;ed with my Boate from <HI>Abington</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I was well en|tertained with good cheere and wor&s;hipfull compa|ny at <HI>Vniver&s;ity Colledge;</HI> The next day I pa&s;&s;ed to a place called <HI>Bablack Hive</HI> (or <HI>Hithe.</HI>) And on Thur&s;e|day the twenty nine, I pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Lechlad,</HI> and came to <HI>Creeklad;</HI> This towne of <HI>Creeklad</HI> is five miles di|&s;tant by land from <HI>Ciciter,</HI> but it is ea&s;ier to row &s;ixtie miles by water on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> then it is to pa&s;&s;e betweene tho&s;e two townes, for there are &s;o
<PB REF="7">many milles, fords and &s;hallowes with &s;tops, and o|ther impediments that a whole daies hard labour with my &s;elfe and foure more could neyther by toyle or Art get but to a Mill of one Ma&s;ter <HI>Hortones</HI> at a place called <HI>Suddington,</HI> a mile &s;hort of <HI>Ciciter,</HI> &s;o that ac|cording to land mea&s;ure we went but foure miles in a long dayes travell. The la&s;t of <HI>Iuly</HI> I left <HI>Suddington</HI> Mill, with the hone&s;t welcome of the Miller and his wife, and with much a doe for want of water I gatt to <HI>Ciciter,</HI> where the River was &s;o dry that it would beare my boate no further; at the hither end of that Towne there &s;tands a great Barne belonging to one <HI>Cooke,</HI> of whom I hired a Waine, wherein I put my Boate my &s;elfe and my Men, Boyes and luggage, this Waine did in le&s;&s;e then five houres draw me from the River <HI>I&s;is</HI> neere <HI>Ciciter,</HI> to a brooke called <HI>Stroud,</HI> which booke hath it's head or Spring in <HI>Be&s;&s;ley</HI> Hundred neere <HI>Mi&s;&s;erden</HI> in <HI>Cot&s;would</HI> in <HI>Glo&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> (<HI>Stowd</HI> and <HI>Churne</HI> might be cut into one, and &s;o <HI>Severne</HI> &amp; <HI>Thames</HI> might be made almo&s;t ioyned friends) are within 4. miles of <HI>Churne,</HI> which hath its fir&s;t &s;pring nere <HI>Cober|ley,</HI> 7. miles from <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> &amp; falles into <HI>I&s;is</HI> about <HI>Laech|lad,</HI> &s;o that 4 miles cutting in the Land betwixt <HI>Churne</HI> and <HI>Stroud,</HI> would be a meanes to make pa&s;&s;ages from <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Severne,</HI> to <HI>Wye,</HI> to both the Rivers of <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and to one River of <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>Monnouth&s;hire,</HI> which falles into the River of <HI>Vske</HI> neere <HI>Cirlion</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> By which meanes goods might be conveyed by water too &amp; from <HI>London,</HI> in Rivers at cheape rates without danger, almo&s;t to half the countyes in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB REF="8">and <HI>Wales.</HI> But there is a devill or two called <HI>&s;loth</HI> and <HI>covetuou&s;ne&s;&s;e,</HI> that are the bane of all good en|deavours and laudable Actions, but more of this &s;hall be &s;aid hereafter.</P>
<P>I being vncarted (with my boate) at a place called <HI>Stonehou&s;e,</HI> in the Affore&s;aid brooke called <HI>Stroud,</HI> with pa&s;sing and wading, with haling over high bankes at fulling milles (where there are many) with plucking over &s;uncke trees, over and under &s;trange Bridges of wood and &s;tone, and in &s;ome places the brooke was &s;carce as broad as my Boate, I being oftentimes im|peached with the bowghes and branches of willowes and Alder Trees, which grew &s;o thicke, hanging over and into the brooke, &s;o that the day light or Sunne could &s;carce peepe through the branches, that in many places all pa&s;&s;ages were &s;top'd; &s;o that I was &s;ome times forced to cut and hew out my way with a hatchett; with this mi&s;erable toyle all the day I gat at night to a Mill called <HI>Froombridge Mill,</HI> whereas (for our comfort) was neither Victualing hou&s;e, meate, drinke or lodging, but that a good gentlewoman, one Mi&s;tris <HI>Bow&s;er,</HI> there did comi&s;erare our wants, and though &s;he were not accu&s;tomed to victuall or lodge Travellers, yet the rarety of our boate, and &s;trangenes of my adventure moved her &s;o farre that &s;hee at an ca&s;ie rate did furni&s;h us with good dyet, my &s;elfe with a bed in an out-hou&s;e, and my men and boyes with a &s;weet new mowed and new made hayloft.</P>
<P>I am much ingaged to a gentleman (one Ma&s;ter <HI>Iohn Stephens,</HI>) who&s;e worthy father <HI>Nathaniell Ste|phanes</HI>
<PB REF="8">E&s;quire) is one of the Knights of the Shire for the County of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> in this Honorable and high Court of Parliament. To this Hou&s;e at <HI>E&s;tington</HI> (corruptly called <HI>E&s;ton</HI>) I was invited from the Mill with my company, where we both at dinner and &s;up|per had welcome and good entertainement on Sun|day the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> I doe further acknowledge my gratitude, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o Ma&s;ter <HI>Mew</HI> the Mini&s;ter there, both for his Spirituall paines taking, twice the &s;aid Saboth, and and al&s;o I thanke him for other courte&s;ies which hee be&s;towed on me.</P>
<P>Munday the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> I tooke my leave at <HI>Froombridge Mill,</HI> and (falling to our old worke againe of haleing and draweing from Mill to Mill, and from one hindrance to another, I came at la&s;t to <HI>Whitmi&s;ter,</HI> where after I had plucked my boate over, I with my <HI>Murnivall</HI> of followers were &s;tayed at the command of a worthy Gentleman named Ma&s;ter <HI>Thomas LLoyd,</HI> to who&s;e hou&s;e neere there we went upon &s;mall intreat|ty, whence my &s;udden entertainement was &s;o freely generous as might have be&s;eemed the per&s;o~ of a good Knight or E&s;quire. The &s;aid gentleman went with me to the brookes mouth, and &s;aw me entred into the River of <HI>Severne,</HI> where (with thankes) I tooke my leave of him, and in two or three howers &s;pace I &s;wom up the <HI>Severne</HI> to the ancient Citie of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> where I was borne, and where by rea&s;on of almo&s;t fifty yeares ab&s;ence I was &s;carce knowne. But the right wor&s;hipfull <HI>Thomas Hill</HI> E&s;quire, Mayor of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> gave me noble entertainement, and invited mee and

<P>I have before related of certaine &s;tops, milles, and wares that doe hinder the pa&s;&s;ages of boates of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>I&s;is,</HI> now I will treate a little of the abu&s;es and u&s;es of other Rivers.</P>
<P>As for the River of <HI>Severne,</HI> it is almo&s;t as much
<PB REF="12">abus'd as us'd, for an in&s;tance, there are Coale|mines neere it, and by the benefit of that River, mane a hundred family is &s;erved with &s;uficient fewell at cheape rates, but &s;ome of tho&s;e Cole|mines doe yeeld neere 1000 tunnes of Rubbi&s;h yearely, which by rea&s;on of the neerene&s;&s;e of the River is all wa&s;hed into it, and makes &s;o many &s;hallowes, that in time <HI>Severne</HI> vvill bee quite choaked up, and all pa&s;&s;age &s;topped, but of that River more at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Avon</HI> River, that &s;erveth <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> would al&s;o be made to &s;erve <HI>Bathe,</HI> and many other parts and places, if <HI>Lockes</HI> were made at we&s;t <HI>Hanham</HI> weare, and at <HI>Keni&s;ham,</HI> (with 4. or 5. places more) for the River doth offer Gods ble&s;&s;ing to the peoples mouthes, if they would but open their lippes to receive them.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Wye</HI> is debard of all pa&s;&s;ages with Boates, by 7.

<PB REF="13">men will bee glad to blow their fingers ends in the Winter through want of fiering, and num|bers of poore will peri&s;h with extreame cold; the complaints and cryes are grievous already; which if I had not heard and &s;eene I would not have beleeved: and 7. lockes at tho&s;e Weares would helpe all and hinder nobody, or el&s;e onely two Lockes would doe much good, the one at <HI>Monmouth</HI> Weare, &amp; the other at <HI>Wilton,</HI> which is but eight miles from <HI>Hereford,</HI> and good vvay by land, for the carriage of any thing that might be brought by vvater.</P>
<P>For the other Kiver <HI>Avon,</HI> it comes from be|yond the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and running by the Tovvnes of <HI>Stretford, Eve&s;holme,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> it falles into <HI>Severne</HI> at <HI>Tewexbury,</HI> &s;o that <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire</HI> (my native Countrey) is encompa&s;t round vvith Navigable Rivers, of vvhich Citie and Countrey I vvill &s;peake a little for Countries &s;ake, but mo&s;t of all for love I beare to truth and Charity.</P>

<P>That commerce and Trade is the &s;trength and &s;in|newes of the common wealth, the chiefe and onely &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of Cities and Corporations, it is appa|rently evident. And the greate&s;t honour and glory of Kingdomes, &amp; the rea&s;ons why &s;everall meanes there are that brings wealth and honour to a citie, all of them put together in one ballance, and the trade of Merchandi&s;ing in the other, it &s;hall overprize them al, upon it alone hangs and depends almo&s;t all other trades, it brings great wealth and honour to all places where it is pro&s;ecuted with &s;ucce&s;&s;e. Witne&s;&s;e that of <HI>Leogorne,</HI> which within this 30. or 40. yeares was but a poore fi&s;hing towne which by that trade alone is now the greate&s;t Mart of the <HI>Medeterenian</HI> Seas. As likewi&s;e the Low-countries, although they cannot
<PB REF="14">build a &s;hip, but mu&s;t fetch the materials from 6. &s;eve|rall kingdomes, yet they build and have more &s;hips then all Chri&s;tendome be&s;ides, &amp; have not any thing almo&s;t of a naturall &s;taple commodity to deale upon, yet by that trade alone they have ingro&s;&s;ed the grea|te&s;t part of the trade, of the Chri&s;tian World to the~|&s;elves; &amp; &s;ome of them (if they plea&s;e) may be gaineful in the trade of merchandi&s;ing there. Now that the Citie of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> is &s;cituated in as convenient a place as any other within this Kingdome, the rea&s;ons fol|lowing &s;hall demon&s;trate. Fir&s;t the &s;aid Citie hath beene an auncient Port towne, graced &amp; infranche&s;ed with priviledges as ample as <HI>London,</HI> or any other citie or Towne within this Kingdom, &amp; dignified with the title of the 3. &s;on of the Kings, and hath beene famous in former ages for the trade of Merchandizing now altogether decayed; And is likewi&s;e &s;ituated in as rich a &s;oyle as any in this Kingdome, who&s;e Markets are alwaies &s;tored with abundance &amp; varieties of all com|modities that the kingdome of <HI>England</HI> affords, inci|dent to the life and being of man. And it is likewi&s;e &s;ituated in as convenient a place for any trade of Merchandizing being upon the famous River of <HI>Se|verne,</HI> then which there is not any more miles Navi|gable within this Kingdome, &amp; al&s;o the River of <HI>Avon</HI> being made Navigable with in foure miles of <HI>Warwick</HI> which &s;tandeth in the heart and center of the &s;aid Kingdome, having both the &s;aid Rivers, the advantage of all opportunities both for exportation &amp; importa|tion of all goods and commodities what&s;oever into
<PB REF="15">and from at lea&s;t a third part of the &s;aid Kingdome, &amp; which parts vents as many forraine commodities and yeelds as many varieties of commodities as any o|ther part of the &s;aid Kingdome doth. And which &s;aid parts cannot bee &s;erved by or from any other parts; then by the &s;aid Rivers unle&s;&s;e they will fetch &amp; bring their commodities over the land three or foure &s;core miles at a great charge, which cannot bee conceived they will doe, if it may be brought home to their doores by water; the &s;aid Citie having by &s;peciall grant under the Great Seale, a &s;patious and conve|nient Key or Wharfe built of &s;tone neare the Kings Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e upon the &s;aid River, at which Key or Wharfe the Sea doth in its due cour&s;e continually ebbe and flow for the bringing in and out of &s;hips, and other boates of convenient burthen, &s;o that a &s;hip of a hundred and fifty tunne, or thereabouts, may at eve|ry tide come to <HI>Gatcombe,</HI> which is but 12 miles from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and therelye &s;ecure, and the River of <HI>Wye</HI> runneth into the <HI>Severne</HI> tenne miles above <HI>Kingrode,</HI> where &s;hips of two or three hundred Tunnes may lye &s;ecure and &s;afe.</P>
<P>And I have ob&s;erved, that the trade that <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> driveth up to the city of <HI>Glouce&s;ter:</HI> and beyond it, in &s;mall Barkes hoighes and Trowes, is at the lea&s;t two hundred Tunnes of all commodities, every &s;pring, which is every fortnight or le&s;&s;e. And it is conceiued and more then probable, that if the &s;aid trade of Merchandizing were &s;ettled within the &s;aid City of <HI>Clouce&s;ter,</HI> (as heretoforeit hath beene) that neither
<PB REF="15">the trades men of the &s;aid City of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> nor others that live three or foure &s;core miles above it, will goe downe to <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> and may have their com|modities in <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> for divers Rea&s;ons and incon|veniences that may thereby happen.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t it &s;aveth three&s;coure miles riding in a dirty Countrey, next the ventring of their goods from <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> by Water, &s;ometimes ca&s;t away, &s;ometimes (the &s;pring not &s;erving) they are benept, and &s;o cannot have their commodities to &s;erve their turne, but u&s;ually much abu&s;ed by Trow-men, &s;o that many that live up the River beyond <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> are thereby greatly di&s;couraged, and doe many times buy their commoditys at <HI>London, Souththampton, Hull,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o bring it home by land three or foure&s;core miles at a great charge, which if the trade were &s;ettled at <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> they would not doe, for which Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid and many other that might be alledged, it hath cau&s;ed divers men well skilled and ver&s;ed in the &s;aid trade of Merchandizing, much to wonder that the &s;aid trade hath beene &s;o long neg|lected, many of which hath concluded that the &s;aid City of <HI>Glonce&s;ter</HI> with the &s;aid key and havens, and the Kings cu&s;tome hou&s;e thereunto, doe lye as conve|nient for the &s;aid trade of Merchandizing, as any other City or Towne within this kingdom, and might drive the greate&s;t trade of any other (<HI>London</HI> only excepted.) For this City of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> &s;tands almo&s;t within (or neere) the Center of this kingdome, and for exporta|tion and Importation, of all Native and forraigne
<PB REF="16">commodities (by Rea&s;on of the riches of the &s;oyle) and Commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Adiacent Rivers, it is com|parable to any place, except the Metropolis <HI>London.</HI> The village of <HI>Galcombe</HI> being at fir&s;t built for the trade of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> (mo&s;t commodious.) Now fora&s;much as it may be objected, that the River of <HI>Seavern</HI> is dange|rous, I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e it is &s;o to tho&s;e that know it not; and through want of practi&s;e (whereby experience &s;howeth) but to tho&s;e that know it, noe danger at all. For there is not one Barge in twenty that hath beene ca&s;t away, but it hath been by the owners covetou&s;nes in loding too deep, or venturing too ra&s;h upo~ the tide, for feare they &s;hould be be kept, &amp; &s;o loo&s;e the &s;pring, all which with a certaine trade up and downe the Ri|ver might wi&s;ely be prevented; All other difficulties that can or may be alledged, are of &s;mall con&s;equence to hinder, if men of meanes and ingenious &s;pirits doe undertake it. The rea&s;on afore&s;aid hath induced &s;ome men well affected to the publike good, and welfarre of this City, to endeavour a beginning of this mo&s;t ho|nourable action, and were they &s;econded with that in|couragement from others, which if they were as wil|ling, as every way able, both with their place and meanes, The nece&s;sity of this cau&s;e &s;o earne&s;tly requi|ring it, the nece&s;sity of this cau&s;e (I &s;ay) &s;o greatly moveing it, there is no doubt but by the ble&s;sing of the Almighty, and that in a &s;hort time it might rai&s;e the ruines of the decayed trade of this City, &s;o much complained of by all, and make it as honourable as now it is contemptible, which is &amp; &s;hal be the dead|ly
<PB REF="16">prayers and de&s;ires of him, who pre&s;enteth this Hoping that no Churli&s;h <HI>Naball,</HI> Mallicious <HI>Sanballar,</HI> corrupted <HI>Tobiah,</HI> proud <HI>Haman,</HI> unmercifull <HI>Dives,</HI> or any of the deadly &s;innes, can or &s;hall hinder &s;o good a worke.</P>
<LG>
<L>FOr who can (but with pittie) here behold</L>
<L>The&s;e multitudes of mi&s;chiefes manifold,</L>
<L>Shall Rivers thus be barr'd with &s;tops and locks,</L>
<L>With Mills, and Hills, with gravels beds, and rocks:</L>
<L>With weares, and weedes, and forced I&s;lands made,</L>
<L>To &s;poyle a pulique for a private Trade?</L>
<L>Shame fall the doers, and th' Almighties ble&s;&s;ng</L>
<L>Be heap'd upon their heads that &s;eeke redreffing.</L>
<L>Were &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to be done in Flanders</L>
<L>Or Holland mong&s;t the indu&s;trious Netherlanders,</L>
<L>They to deepe pa&s;&s;ages would turne our hils,</L>
<L>To Windmills they would change our watermils.</L>
<L>All helps unto the&s;e rivers they would ayd,</L>
<L>And all impedunents &s;hall be de&s;troyed:</L>
<L>Our vagabonds (the wandring brood of Caine,)</L>
<L>They would inforce tho&s;e runna gates take paine,</L>
<L>Whereby much profit quickly would accrue,</L>
<L>(For labour robs the hangman of his due.)</L>
<L>In common rea&s;on, all men mu&s;t agree</L>
<L>That if the&s;e Rivers were made cleane and free,</L>
<L>One Barge, with eight poore mens iudu&s;trious paines,</L>
<L>Would carry more than forty carts or waines.</L>
<L>And every waine to draw them hor&s;es five,</L>
<L>And each two men or boye to guide or drive.</L>
<L>Charge of an hundred hor&s;e and eighty men</L>
<L>With eight mens labour would be &s;erved then,</L>
<L>Thus men would be implovd, and hor&s;e pre&s;erv'd,</L>
<L>And all the Countrey at cheape rates be &s;erv'd.</L>
<L>'Tis &s;aid the Dutchmen taught us drinke and &s;will,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure we goe beyond them in that skill,</L>
<L>I wi&s;h (as we exceede them in what's bad,)</L>
<L>That we &s;ome portion of their goodne&s;&s;e had:</L>
<L>Then &s;hould this worthy worke be &s;oone begun,</L>
<L>And with &s;ucce&s;&s;efull expedition done?</L>
<PB REF="17">
<L>Which I di&s;paire not of, but humbly plead,</L>
<L>That God his ble&s;&s;ings will increa&s;e and &s;pread</L>
<L>On them that love this worke, and on their heires,</L>
<L>Their goods and chattels, and on all that's theirs?</L>
<L>I wi&s;h them ble&s;t externall, and internall,</L>
<L>And in the end with happine&s;&s;e eternall.</L>

<P>In the mo&s;t part of my Iourney, I came to few places but their was to be found plenty of beggers, or Doggmaticall, Sci&s;maticall, full of Beggerly Rudiments, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Galathians.</HI> 4. Opi|nionated divers wayes; and every one would have his owne fancy, to &s;tand for his Religion; for they all dif|fer one from another, yet all joyne again&s;t that which they have beene baptized and brought up in; In one place there is a blind old woman, and &s;he repeates, and Interprets: in another a <HI>Pavier,</HI> and he will take upon him to mend the way. Then their is a Strange fellow (a <HI>Baker,</HI>) one light loafe and he will new bolt, &s;ift, Knead, and mould Relligion. In another a <HI>quon|dam</HI> Brewers Clearke, (would faine be a Prie&s;t) and Preaches mo&s;t wonderfully in a mault hou&s;e, be&s;ides a zealous Sowgelder, that profe&s;&s;eth mo&s;t de&s;perate doctrine. Good Lord in thy mercy looke upon us, and give us true peace and unity, both in Church and Common wealth.</P>
