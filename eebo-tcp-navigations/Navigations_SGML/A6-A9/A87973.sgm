<P>June the forth. In the morning Inteligence was brought that <HI>Tromp</HI> was neere <HI>Flankenburgh,</HI> &amp; it was thought he would make way towards <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> which is one of the be&s;t Ports they have. This day we had brought into us &s;everall Dutch ve&s;&s;els, and Scouts were &s;ent forth &s;everall wayes for making a further di&s;covery of &s;uch of the Dutch as had e&s;caped away in the fight into any of their Ports, as likewi&s;e to catch up any of their Merchantmen that &s;hould be &s;liping into any of their Harbours, and it was re&s;olved by a Councell of War that our maine Fleet &s;hould follow the pur&s;uit of <HI>Tromp</HI> and &s;uch as had e&s;caped with him, and &s;o towards <HI>Flu&s;hing.</HI></P>
<P>June the fift. We were againe within &s;ight of &s;ome of the Enemy, but he crept away by the <HI>Sholes</HI> and <HI>Sands</HI> where we could not come at them; &s;omething
<PB N="4" REF="4">like the Highlanders in <HI>Scotland</HI> who &s;ave them&s;elves by their inacce&s;&s;able holds.</P>
<P>This day a view was taken of many hundred &s;ick &amp; wounded &s;ouldiers &s;ouldiers of the Dutch who were taken by our fleet, and care taken for &s;etting them on &s;hore in their own Country, and they being in pain and mi&s;ery are likely to give their other Country men the true&s;t information after their vapouring again&s;t Dover, which (though it &s;avoured rather of impudent in&s;olency then of valour, yet) was printed a huge and mighty victory at the Hague.</P>
<P>June 6. Our Fleet came near the Texel, and the &s;ick and wounded &s;ouldiers of the Dutch before men|tioned, were put into long boats and other ve&s;&s;els (upon their parole) and lanced out to go on &s;hore, and ma|king forth towards the land, they (being de&s;cried from the Ca&s;tle) the Dutch let fly many great guns at their own men, and upon this they received a great allarum into the Country, about which time the main body of our fleet appeared within &s;ight, at which the people cri|ed out they were betrayed and undone, and in &s;uch an amazement they continued.</P>
<P>The next day we did not onely take many of their &s;hips near their own harbours, but fired others, and &s;ent many hundred great &s;hot on &s;hore among&s;t them, <HI>and now judge you whether we are not even with them for their attempt upon Dover;</HI> and we are upon another de|&s;ign to find them work at home, not doubting but by the next you will hear that &s;ome of their &s;trong holds are in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>This day &s;ome of our Scouts brought in two Dutch ve&s;&s;els, and divers water &s;hips and others came from the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts with &s;upplies of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries, as we &s;tood in need of they al&s;o bring us news that many &s;upplies are coming after which will be very &s;ervice|able for carrying on of the work in hand.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Dutch fleet which e&s;aped is is gotten into the harbour at Flu&s;hing, where we hope to keep them from doing further mi&s;chief upon the &s;eas again&s;t England.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Dover, dated, the 9th. of June.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe&s;e three or four days together many &s;hips which came out of the River of Thames, pa&s;&s;ed this way to|wards our fleet which is on the Coa&s;t of Holland, wherein went a con&s;iderable number of &s;ouldiers, and a great quan|tity of powder, &s;hot, and Ammunition, as likewi&s;e a great number of Shovels, Spades, Pick-axes, and other nece&s;&s;aries for land &s;ervice, we hear al&s;o that the like &s;upplies are go|ing to them from &s;everal other parts belonging to this Com|monwealth. Some wounded &s;ouldiers are gone up to London and others remain here under cure, the State having ta|ken &s;pecial care for &s;ending down able Chyrurgians into the&s;e parts to cure &s;uch as &s;tand in need of their help.</P>
<P>This day arrived a ve&s;&s;el here which landed &s;everal per&s;ons, which &s;ay that they have been with our fleet, &amp; one of
<PB N="6" REF="5">them reports that Gen. Blake and Gen. Monk, are before Flu&s;hing, and be heard at his coming away that &s;ome of our men were landed in a kind of a &s;mal I&s;land near Flu&s;hing in Zealand, where no hor&s;e could get to them, and if we could keep it, it would conduce very much to the effectual blocking up of that City, and &s;ecuring their &s;hipping in the harbour. Some of our fleet is &s;ent out &s;everal ways to di&s;|cover the preparations and motion of the enemy, and we hear they are in a great di&s;traction among them&s;elves, and Trump whom not long &s;ince carried a Broom in his Top-Ma&s;t to &s;weep the Seas, dares not &s;o much as &s;weep his door, &s;carce daring to &s;hew his head. The Officers in general ac|cu&s;e one another, and the common people blame not onely them but their high and mighty <HI>Hogen Mogens.</HI> I tru&s;t the Lord will put a &s;udden period to the&s;e wars, to the prai&s;e of his great Name, and the good of his &s;ervants that de&s;ire to walk uprightly before him, which is the prayer of</P>
