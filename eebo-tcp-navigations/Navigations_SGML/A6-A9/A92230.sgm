<HEAD>REASONS <HI>for Pre&s;erving the Publick Market of</HI> Blackwell-Hall, <HI>and re&s;training the</HI> Levant <HI>Company of Merchants from de|ferring their Shipping as long as they plea&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Humbly Offer'd to the PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Life of Trade depends upon an equal Encouragement to all Per&s;ons that are In&s;truments of its Promotion: And the Variety of Circum&s;tances that make an Odds in Buying and Selling (the tender part of Trade) are &s;o many, that nothing but a Publick Market can make an equal Ballance, where alone the Buyer and Seller are upon equal Ground. The Buildings of <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> (fairly accommodated to Trade) are now become no more (for the mo&s;t part in Merchants Cloth) than a Reception to collect a Duty out of the Cloth, and then &s;ent by Factors and others into private Hou&s;es for a Sale, and the Maker become an unconcern'd Per&s;on in the Sale of his own Goods, &s;carce a Merchant appearing at this publick Market.</P>
<P>The Hard&s;hips upon the Clothiers from this Alteration, which is about twenty or thirty Years, are chiefly the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. He can never know what Quantities of Cloth of any &s;ort is upon Hand to be &s;old, which is a great light for his Government in holding up the Price of his Goods; whil&s;t the Merchants and Packers are well enough conver&s;ant in this Point: Nay, the Packers many times magnifie their Stock of Cloth, to give the Merchants Encouragement to come and buy from the greater Choice; as hath been manife&s;t from many In&s;tances; which is hard upon the Maker.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereby the Merchants have their Parcels of Cloth laid up by the Packers again&s;t a Shipping, which remain upon the Clothiers Account, thereby beating down the Price in little Parcels to &s;upport the Work-people; and when the Shipping come, the whole Parcel &s;old off at that Price, and not the lea&s;t Advance made by the Merchant: Whereas, was &s;o great Quantities of Cloth bought by many Hands in the Publick Market, it would nece&s;&s;a|rily make &s;ome Advance upon Cloth, and our Monied Merchants, to gain that Advantage, would always be a buying before-hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Packer and Factor, to accommodate the Merchant, hath brought on a long Credit with Cloth; and the Packer being under other Obligations, is always very tender of pre&s;&s;ing the Merchant for Payment, if his Conditions are not performed: Neither, indeed, is he a fit Per&s;on to be employed in the Sale of Cloth for a Clothier, having a nearer Intere&s;t of his own to prefer.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Packer being a Buyer of Cloth him&s;elf again&s;t a Shipping, is always a beating down the Price upon the Clothier, for his own Advantage; and the be&s;t Opportunities for Sales be&s;ure will be re&s;erved for his own Goods, if not put off by a better Sortment of the Clothier's.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hereby the Merchant having Opportunity to buy Cloth upon any day of the Week, the Clothier hath no Di&s;patch in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, but remains twice as long in Town as in former days, when no Cloth was to be had at the fir&s;t-hand, but at the publick Market, upon the u&s;ual Market-days; which kept the Merchant to a Di&s;patch with the Clothier.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equences of which hath been, that the Price of Cloth hath been beat down a third part, the Prices of Wages in the Country many times from Nine-pence to Six-pence; be&s;ides many Hard&s;hips to the poor Labourers, in putting Commodities upon them above the real Value. How far this Management hath affected the Country-Gentleman's E&s;tate, he is now to make a Judgment.</P>
<P>The Practice of our <HI>Turkey-Merchants,</HI> for many Years pa&s;t, in deferring their Shippings above two Years at a time, being added to this, (which was eminently made out by &s;ome of their own Members,) doth &s;ufficiently illu&s;trate the low Prices of Wooll, and the Poverty of the Country.</P>
<P>The Packers who have been intru&s;ted with the Sale of the Clothiers Cloth, without per|adventure were true to the Merchants Intere&s;t, otherwi&s;e they had never appeared &s;o vi|gorous to &s;upport their Practice: And this being evidently &s;o, the Politick Timeing of their Shipping, hath ea&s;ily procured Cloth upon their own Terms. In the Year 1675. the Clothiers Petitioned the Parliament again&s;t this Grievance, and it was then re&s;olved, That the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants &s;hould &s;end Ships with the Woollen-Manufactures twice a Year to their re&s;pective Factories: But the Order being not brought into a Law, through the ri&s;ing of the Parliament, it was &s;oon forgot, and wor&s;e Practi&s;es u&s;ed in that kind &s;ince that time than was before, which we hope will now be redre&s;s'd by this Bill.</P>
<P>But our Merchants and Packers now give out, that they will ruin the Clothiers of tho&s;e Counties that are the Promoters of this Bill, by getting &s;ome particular Counties excepted, a greater Kindne&s;s than the Clothiers them&s;elves de&s;ired; And in order hereto, they have pro|cured a Letter, from &s;ome few Clothiers of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> to their Members, to de&s;ire the &s;ame, which would be very unrea&s;onable, in that they are but one days Journey di&s;tant from this publick Market, and mo&s;t other Counties above two. The next Exception is <HI>Suffolk</HI> Cloth, which hath been always &s;old at <HI>Leaden-hall-Market,</HI> and is no way affected by this Bill; as al&s;o <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> when the Cloth of that County is Ship'd off at <HI>Hull,</HI> and none brought to <HI>London</HI> but what is bought in the Country, which is pro|vided for in the Bill. The whole of which we humbly &s;ubmit to the Impartial Ju&s;tice of this Honourable Hou&s;e.</P>
