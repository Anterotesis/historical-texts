<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of
<HI>Dover,</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Rochford,</HI> Lord <HI>Hun&s;don,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Approach your Lord&s;hip with
the &s;ame hardine&s;s as they who
&s;atisfie them&s;elves, that the
&s;incerity of the Giver may attone for
the little value of the gift; having
learnt this pre&s;umption from Hi&s;to|ry,
where I find that great Princes
have look'd kindly upon mean obla|tions,
and thereby rendred the ge|nero&s;ity
of their acceptance more il|lu&s;trious,
by the duty and obedience
of the Pre&s;enters.</P>
<P>Nor with this trick of moral &s;to|ry
would I be thought to wind your
Lord&s;hip into the reception of a
trifle, but that I carry a braver de|&s;ign
in it; that is, on this occa&s;ion
<PB REF="3">
to make a publick acknowledgment
of the many and great favours (and
of one e&s;pecially above the re&s;t, the o|verflow
of your noblene&s;s) which you
have been pleas'd to confer upon your
unworthy &s;ervant. For (my Lord)
the &s;en&s;e of them hitherto, bounded
within the narrow knowledge of my
meanne&s;s, hath &s;eem'd to me a kind
of guilty concealment, and almo&s;t
tantamount to a denyal of them, till
I was able to render this happy and
open declaration to the world, of an
humble and ob&s;equious gratitude for
tho&s;e favours done me; and &s;o done,
that your generous affability in di&s;|&s;pen&s;ing
them may for ever condemn
the rough cu&s;tom of the age, who&s;e
haughty &s;tate in doing kindne&s;&s;es,
does mo&s;t commonly turn their
bread into &s;tone.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
And though I know, that thanks
alone is no payment &s;terling; yet
&s;ince to the greatest Beings for the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting benefits we
can &s;carce make any better return.
I hope it will not &s;eem &s;trange, if I
pre&s;ent your Lord&s;hip the memory of
your own goodne&s;s to pay your &s;elf.
For where the obligation exceeds
po&s;&s;ibility of requital, the &s;aw&s;ine&s;s
of attempting to &s;atisfie, is infinitely
wor&s;e than the humble acknowledg|ment
of &s;till owing.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I offer to your view a
piece, that dare not &s;tand the te&s;t of
your Judgment, but would humbly
&s;helter near your goodne&s;s, &amp; which
(when your Lord&s;hip takes breath
from your other more weighty both
publick and private affairs) may
<PB REF="4">
&s;erve to entertain you in the le&s;s
&s;erious part of the day; The matter
is lea&s;t mine, the form &amp; compo&s;ure
I may own a whole &s;hare in; &s;o the
<HI>Bulloin</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> (if the allu&s;ion
be not pre&s;umptuous) becomes the
Kings coin, after it has receiv'd his
stamp &amp; image. And as after view|ing
the &s;catter'd plea&s;ures of a large
and fair Garden, &s;ome &s;atisfaction
is receiv'd from the contracted &s;cent
and beauty of a po&s;ie; &s;o if I have
here at all ju&s;tified the compa|ri&s;on,
whatever error may have pa&s;t
in the choice or ordering of the flow|ers,
I hope your Lord&s;hip will pardon

<P>SInce for Per&s;ons of Your Quality

Afflictions of this Nature; there
is now a nece&s;&s;ity that you un|dergo
Your Fate, which is &s;o much the

But it may be (<HI>Madam</HI>) after an

<P>'Tis true (<HI>Madam</HI>) that the Worth|le&s;&s;ene&s;s

take notice that my greate&s;t Ambition

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Pre&s;ent you (Reader) with a novelty,
which if your pallate be not wholly vi|tiated,
may generally reli&s;h well with you.
For the variety of the matter you may call it
a kind of <HI>Olio,</HI> the &s;ea&s;oning of which hath
co&s;t me both time and expence; and
though it be not of the choice&s;t rarities, it is
done at lea&s;t according to the be&s;t of my
skill. If by this &s;lender attempt I may pro|voke
any better able more hand&s;omely and
regularly to couch a &s;ubject attended with
&s;o much both profit and plea&s;ure, I think I
have done the kind and indu&s;trious part of
<PB REF="7">
the world no ill office, who will (though
but for this rea&s;on) let pa&s;s without rigid
and &s;upercilious Cen&s;ure the mean E&s;&s;ay of
him, who&s;e ardor to &s;erve them, hath ren|dred
him le&s;s &s;eeing in the examination of
his own ability. Yet would I not be con|ceiv'd
to know my &s;elf and value my pains
&s;o little, but that I may merit &s;ome thanks,
at lea&s;t from the well tempered mea&s;urers
of mens intentions: however &s;ome there
will be (and tho&s;e not a few) whom I could
wi&s;h (becau&s;e I love my &s;elf well) might
be won to my &s;ide) but I fear my &s;ingle ta|lent
of per&s;wa&s;ion will never be able to gain
them; for being ill-natured, and therefore
doing nothing them&s;elves but mi&s;chief,
they carry an inten&s;e hatred to tho&s;e that
would humbly do good, nay though it be
done never &s;o perfectly. What quarter
then my poor offering (being &s;en&s;ible to
how many exceptions it may be lyable) is
like to find among them I well know, but
have heart enough not much to fear; e|&s;pecially
hoping among the Candid Ingeni|ous
&s;uch reception as will amply remunerate
<PB REF="7">
me for all the ill u&s;age I may meet with
el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Here is a ta&s;t then (to you kind Reader
I &s;peak it) of what in &s;o u&s;eful a Subject
might be performed by a more judicious
pen, Analects of the Hi&s;tory and De&s;cripti|on
of the World, not &s;o choicely nor methodi|cally
handled as might be expected, but yet
may &s;erve to refre&s;h your memory after the
tedious and ill way of other mighty Vo|lumes.
It were a worthy employ for any
that hath parts and lei&s;ure to go through
with it (in a more acute and accurate man|ner,
not emitting ought memorable) to ex|tract
from tho&s;e numerous Records of Hi|&s;tory
all &s;uch &s;hort Memoirs as may tend
either to in&s;truction or delight. And as he
will thereby infinitely oblige both the&s;e,
who&s;e way of Education may have le&s;s qua|lified
them to di&s;tingui&s;h the Stars in &s;ail|ing
on the va&s;t Ocean of Story; and tho&s;e
al&s;o, who&s;e confinement in time or coin
may di&s;enable them for &s;uch expen&s;ive
ways of knowledge: So &s;hall he in particu|lar
find me the mo&s;t acknowledging of all
<PB REF="8">
his Servants, mu&s;t e&s;teem mine mo&s;t happy
faults, that have been to him incentives of
a&s;piring to the true glory of Writing better.</P>

DESCRIPTION
OF THE
WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>IN our De&s;cription of the World
there are four parts, into which the
World is divided; <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,
Africa, America utraque.</HI></P>
<P>We will begin fir&s;t with <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> for in
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> did God him&s;elf &s;peak his miracu|lous
work of the Creation: There was
the Church fir&s;t collected, there was
the Saviour of the world born, Cruci|fied
and Rai&s;ed again: Indeed the great|e&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="10">
part of Divine Hi&s;tory was there
written and Acted; There was the fir&s;t
Monarch, and Monarchies of the World
in <HI>A&s;&s;yria, Per&s;ia, Babylonia, Media.</HI> The
fir&s;t people of the world received their
being in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and the &s;everal
tongues of the World their Original in
<HI>Babylonia:</HI> The&s;e are parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
and were in the fir&s;t ages ble&s;t with
God's own holy Pre&s;ence, <HI>Exodus</HI> the
third; and the footing of <HI>Angels, Exod.</HI>
14. However, now it is left (for her In|fidelity)
to the puni&s;hment of a Prophe|tical
Cur&s;e that long before pa&s;&s;ed up|on
her, and is delivered up into the
hands of Turks, and Nations that
Bla&s;pheme the Creatour, and there|fore
doth not flouri&s;h in that height
as heretofore.</P>
<P>Now add together, that this Re|gion
was at fir&s;t the Paradi&s;e of the
World, and indeed &s;till enjoyeth a fer|tile
Soyl and temperate Air, and that
it exceeds in compa&s;s the two other
parts of the old World, to which &s;he was
<PB N="3" REF="10">
the Mi&s;tre&s;s for Arts and Sciences; Yet is
it not at this day &s;o well peopled in
proportion, as this little <HI>Europe,</HI> which
came many hundred years after; for
this we need &s;earch no further cau&s;e than
God's ju&s;t Anger: Yet hath he not ex|erci&s;ed
upon her, only by Miraculous
and Immediate Puni&s;hment from Hea|ven,
but hath &s;uffered (as it were) her
own Creatures, over which Man at
the fir&s;t had the Rule) to turn head
upon their Lords, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their
Habitation, for it is &s;o over-run with
wild-Bea&s;ts, and cruel Serpents, that
in many places they live not without
much danger.</P>
<P>In this; though the Nation &s;uffer for
their Mon&s;trous Irreligion; Yet the
Earth which did not offend, re&s;erves her
place, and abounds with many excellent
commodities, not el&s;e-where to be
had; Myrrhe, Frankincen&s;e, Cinamon,
Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Pepper, Musk,
Jewels of great e&s;teem, and Minerals of
all &s;orts; It breeds Elephants, Camels,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
and many other Bea&s;ts; Serpents, Fowl
wild and tame, and &s;ome have added
&s;uch Mon&s;trous &s;hapes of men, as pa&s;&s;e
all belief.</P>
<P>In <HI>A&s;ia</HI> were the &s;even Churches
which St. <HI>John</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Apo|calips;</HI>
now &s;carce is it inhabited but to|ward
the Sea-&s;ide, and that by a ba&s;e

in their life, and odious Idolaters in their
Religions, for the mo&s;t part Mahu|metans.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> it &s;elf the Star of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
that as well for her Reli|gion
as her miraculous
Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is within the compa&s;s of that one part which bears the name of <HI>A&s;ia pro|pria.</HI></NOTE> &s;et the world at

<HI>Cte&s;ifon,</HI> but was 220. years in build|ing,

There is no Region of the World &s;o

and have four fins, they are as great as
three or four men can carry, the upper
part of them is covered with a great
&s;hell, which they call a Galley patch,
weighing about half a hundred weight,

Sea, &s;pending the Spring time, and part
of Sommer about the&s;e I&s;lands, but the
re&s;idue of the year, is not known where.
They are like to Fowl in re&s;pect of
&s;mallne&s;s, and fa&s;hion of their heads and
necks, which are wrinckled like a Tur|kies,
but white, and not &s;o &s;harp Billed.
They al&s;o breed their young of Eggs
which th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">y lay. They re&s;emble Bea&s;ts,
in that their fle&s;h is like Veal, but more
hard and &s;olid, and they feed always up|on
gra&s;s growing at the bottom of the
water; neither can they abide any lon|ger
under water then they hold their
breath, which the old ones will do long,
but the young ones being cha&s;ed to and
fro, cannot continue two Minutes with|out
coming up to breathe. Shortly after
their fir&s;t coming in, the Male and Fe|male
<PB N="49" REF="33">
couple, which is there called Coot|ing;
this they continue &s;ome three days
together, during which time, they will
&s;carce &s;eparate though a Boat come to
them, nor hardly when they are &s;mit|ten.
Not long after, the &s;he Turckle
comes up by night upon &s;ome &s;andy
Bay, and further up then the water u|&s;eth
to flow, &s;he digs a hole with her
Fin in the &s;and &s;ome two foot deep, and
there coming up &s;everal nights lays her
Eggs; &s;ome half a bu&s;hel (which are a|bout

round as a Ball, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters">ch time covers
them with &s;and very curiou&s;ly, &s;o that
a Man &s;hall hardly find the place. The&s;e
Eggs (as it &s;eems) are afterwards hatch|ed
by the heat of the Sun, and then by
the providence of God (the means as yet
unknown) are brought out of the
Earth; for they could never perceive
that &s;he returns any more to them, and
yet in likelihood they remain not long in
the Earth after they are hatched, be|cau&s;e
(as is before &s;aid) they cannot live
<PB N="50" REF="34">
without breathing. Sometimes is &s;een
the young ones no bigger then a Mans
hand, which &s;ome Fi&s;h will devour.
They grow &s;lowly, and &s;eem to have a
very long life; they'l &s;leep on the top
of the Water, and were wont to &s;leep
often on the Land, till the Country was
peopled; they will al&s;o live out of the
Water &s;ome three weeks, and that
without Meat, but mourn and pine a|way,
they are very witty. Being on the
Land turned upon their backs, they can
no more without &s;ome help or advan|tage
recover them&s;elves, by which
means when they come on &s;hore to lay
their Eggs, they are ea&s;ily taken, as al|&s;o
they are when they are Cooting.
But otherwi&s;e they take them for the
mo&s;t part by night, making a great light
in a Boat, to which they will &s;ome|times
&s;wim, and &s;eldom &s;hun; &s;o that a
Man &s;tanding ready with a &s;taffe in his
hand, at one end of which he hath a Soc|ket,
wherein is an Iron le&s;s then a Mans

tyred her &s;elf by &s;wimming to and

the head being cut off four and twenty
hours, &s;o that if you cut the fle&s;h with a

The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> (&s;aith he) are a &s;trong and bold

nimble, &s;tout and haughty of heart; care|le&s;s
of life, but greedy of glory; courte|ous
to &s;trangers, con&s;tant in Love, light
of belief, impatient of injury, given to
fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, and in enmity implacable.
At the baptizing of their Infants, their
manner was, not to dip their right arms
into the water, that &s;o (as they thought)
they might give a more deep and un|curable
blow, never calling them by the
name of their Parents while&s;t they li|ved
together, but at their death took it
upon them: Their Women nur&s;ed
not their Children they bare, and they
that nur&s;ed others, did affect and love
them much more than their own.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="65">

<P>Super&s;titious Idolatry among the
Wild <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> was common, yielding di|vine
honour unto the Moon after the

their knees, and made &s;upplications, and
with a Loud Voice would thus &s;peak
unto that Planet, <HI>We pray thee leave us

and both the &s;ucking Child and Nur&s;e

their own hair, &s;o far following <HI>Venus</HI>

large, &s;tained with Saffron, the &s;leeves
wide, and hanging to their knees, &s;trait

skirts, their Breeches clo&s;e to the thighs,
a &s;hort skeine hanging point down be|fore,

down their backs and &s;houlders from un|der
foulden wreaths of fine Linnen, roll|ed
about their heads, rather loding the

for as the one was mo&s;t &s;eemly, &s;o the

betwixt them they &s;ent into the World
a pernicious deceiver (which none but

been for a while thus in&s;tructed by his

di&s;tracted Parents, poverty and hope to
improve his Fortunes, per&s;waded him
from his Native &s;oil, to live for another
while among true profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians,
where he received &s;o much knowledge
of the Word, and light of the Go&s;pel,
as to pervert it to his de&s;truction, and
ruine of many Millions of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t adventurous travels a|broad,

which he continued and &s;educed others,
till the death of his Ma&s;ter, and after
marryed his Aged, but rich Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He had means now to act his malicious
purpo&s;es, and wealth to countenance his
exceeding Pride, which would not be
<PB N="120" REF="69">
&s;atisfied with a lower Ambition, then to
be called a Prophet of God. This he
began to practice, by the Coun&s;el of one
<HI>Sergius</HI> a Monk, who being ca&s;t out for
Here&s;ie from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> betook
him&s;elf into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and joyned in with
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to make up this mi&s;chief per|fect:
&s;ee now their Juggling. There
wanted no craft betwixt them, to make
u&s;e of his wor&s;t actions to gull the &s;im|ple.
For when by his debaucht drinking
and gluttony, he was fallen into an Epi|lep&s;ie,
and in his fits lay (Bear like) gro|velling
and foaming upon the Earth, as
one without &s;en&s;e; he pretended an
Exta-like &s;woon, wherein his &s;oul was
wrapped from his body, in which he con|ver&s;t
with <HI>Gabriel</HI> an Angel from Hea|ven.
To make this familiarity with God
the more to be believed, he had bred
up a Dove to take her meat from his ear,
which he mo&s;t bla&s;phemou&s;ly profe&s;&s;ed
to be the Holy Gho&s;t, who in &s;uch times
and in that &s;hape infu&s;ed the prophe&s;ies
which he was to preach. La&s;tly, what
<PB N="121" REF="69">
they in their wicked fancies had concei|ved,
and meant to propagate, they di|ge&s;ted
into a Volume, and called it the
Alcoran.</P>
<P>For this too they had a trick, that it
might &s;eem to have been &s;ent from
Heaven into the hands of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and
to this purpo&s;e he had him&s;elf fed up a
tame Bull, which by cu&s;tom became &s;o
familliar, that no &s;ooner he heard the
voice of his Ma&s;ter, but he would
&s;traight run, ca&s;t the head in his lap, and
u&s;e his wanton dalliance as with a Fel|low.
Betwixt the horns of this Bull, had
he fa&s;tned the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and conveyed
him into a by-place, near where he had
a&s;&s;embled the Multitude at a &s;et time,
to expect a wonderful Miracle from
Heaven that might confirm his Prophe|cy.
The Scene thus ordered, on the
&s;udden he lift up his voice, and made a
loud cry, which no &s;ooner the bea&s;t
heard, but he brake his way through the
Pre&s;s, over-turned many of the Specta|tors,
which now &s;tood at a gaze, and
<PB N="122" REF="70">
gently laid his horns and book in the bo|&s;om
of this fal&s;e couzener, which he with
much ceremony, and feigned Reverence
received, and in their pre&s;ence opening
the Volume, began to interpret the chief
of their Laws, which for hereafter they
were to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion he allowed, and with
the old Law forbad Swines fle&s;h, that
he might with more ea&s;e lead on &s;uch
as were Jewi&s;h; he &s;uffered him|&s;elf
to be baptized by <HI>Sergius,</HI> that the
Chri&s;tian too might have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
his content: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and our Savi|our
he denyed not to be great Pro|phets,
but that neither party might e|mulate
the greater ob&s;ervance of other,
and indeed e&s;pecially that his own
might &s;eem new, and yet take place
from both, he changed the circum&s;ion
of the Jews from the eighth day, and
multiplyes bapti&s;m, which can be con|ferred
but once for all, upon the true
believer. For the like rea&s;on of diffe|rence
with other Nations and Sects, he
<PB N="123" REF="70">
left both the Jews Sabbath, and <HI>diem
Chri&s;tianorum Dominicum,</HI> and com|mands
his holy ceremonies to be cele|brated
on the <HI>Friday;</HI> for &s;o it was,
whent he Bull be&s;towed on him his <HI>Al|caran.</HI>
Before they enter the Temple,
they wa&s;h all the unclean parts of their
bodies, and then to prayer, which mu&s;t
be performed five times in a day with
their face toward the <HI>South.</HI> They have
a Months fa&s;t too once every year, but
it is ob&s;erved only for the day, for they
may, when the Sun is down, redeem it
with what gluttony they plea&s;e; Wine
is forbidden, only for a &s;hew that he
might not &s;eem to have loved that
which (he was guilty to him&s;elf) had
brought him into his Epileptical fits.
Briefly, what he knew would be&s;t agree
with the bruti&s;h de&s;ires of the people,
that he took order &s;hould be confirmed
by his Laws, four or five Wives to eve|ry
Husband, and as many Concubines as
they could maintain. For their bli&s;s af|ter
life, he propo&s;ed no invi&s;ible de|lights
<PB N="124" REF="71">
which over reacht their under|&s;tanding,
but proportioned to each of
their &s;en&s;ual thoughts. And promi&s;ed
to tho&s;e which would keep his Law a
Paradi&s;e of all kinds of plea&s;ure, which
they them&s;elves mo&s;t affected, to the
covetous wealth, to the ambitious Ho|nours,
to the gluttenous Meats, to the
Virgins rich attire, and embraces of An|gels,
the poor &s;ouls were never &s;o fitted;
and when he had thus for a long time
di&s;cour&s;ed over his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he took a
yoak from <HI>Sergius,</HI> and put it upon the
Bulls neck; for it was fore-told by an
In&s;cription brought by his door, that
who&s;oever could yoke the Bull, it
&s;hould be a &s;ign to declare the man, as
one &s;ent from God, to govern his peo|ple.</P>
<P>This huddle of Miracles put the Ga|zers
beyond all pau&s;e, &s;o that in an in|&s;tant

true believers, which the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;till af|fects,
<PB N="125" REF="71">
rather than his right name of <HI>Turk,</HI>
which imports bani&s;hment, and unpraids
him the di&s;grace of his Original.</P>
<P>And now he hath pa&s;t the difficulty
of his attempt, an ea&s;ie matter to draw
on Millions of followers, &s;uch as would
like that Religion be&s;t which baulkt not

an end an&s;werable to his beginning, for

number of &s;hips and Boats, which are in

Gallow&s;es and wheels, where

<P><PB N="145" REF="81">
When they were come to <HI>Prague,</HI>
which was but two days after a mo&s;t
fearful execution of two notorious Of|fenders;
the manner how, with their
faults, as it was truly related to them
by Engli&s;h Gentelmen that &s;aw it, I
&s;hall relate it. The one of them being
taken, apprehended and racked, for
ripping up a live Woman with Child,
and for taking the Infant out of her bo|dy,
did &s;ow a living puppy into her bel|ly,
all which he confe&s;&s;ed he did to
make properties for Witchcraft; and be|ing
further tortured, he confe&s;&s;ed when
&amp; where he had committed 35 murthers
more. The other in re&s;pect of him was
but a petty offender, for he in all his
life-time had murthered but 14. for
the which execrable facts, their de&s;er|ved
executions were as followeth. Fir&s;t,
they were brought out of the Goal na|ked
from the girdle upward, and &s;o be|ing
bound fa&s;t on high in a Cart, that
the Spectators might &s;ee them, then the
hangman having a pan of Coals near
<PB N="146" REF="82">
him, with red hot pincers nip'd of the
nipple of one brea&s;t, then he took a
knife and gives him a &s;la&s;h or cut down
the back on one &s;ide from the &s;houlder
to the wa&s;te, and pre&s;ently gave him
&s;uch another &s;la&s;h, three inches from the
fir&s;t, then on the top he cut the &s;la&s;hes
into one, and pre&s;ently taking pincers,
took hold of the cro&s;s cut, and tore him
down like a Gir&s;e below the middle,
letting it hang down behind him like a
belt, after which he took his burning
pincers, and pluck'd off the tops of his
fingers of one hand; then pa&s;&s;ing to ano|ther
place of the Town, his other nipple
was plucked off, the other &s;ide of his
back &s;o cut and mangled, (which they
call by the name of rimming) his other
fingers nip'd off; then pa&s;&s;ing further, all
his Toes were nip'd off with the burning
pincers, after which he was inforced to
come out of the Cart, and go on foot
up a &s;teep hill to the Gallows, where he
was broken with a wheel alive, one bone
after another, beginning at his leggs,
<PB N="147" REF="82">
and ending with his neck, and la&s;t of all
quartered and laid on the Wheel, on a
high po&s;t, till Crows, Ravens, or con|&s;uming
time con&s;ume him.</P>
<P>This was the manner of both their
executions, but I &s;peak of the greate&s;t
murther particularly, becau&s;e it is re|ported
that all the&s;e torments never
made him once to change countenance,
or to make any &s;ign or action of grief, to
call to God for mercy, or to intreat the
people to pray for him, but as if he had
been a &s;en&s;le&s;s &s;tock or &s;tone, he did
mo&s;t &s;cornfully, and as it were in di&s;dain
abide it; whil&s;t the other Villain did cry,
rore, and make lamentation, calling up|on
God often. The difference was not
much in their lives, and manner of their
deaths, but the odds may be great in
their dying.</P>

about the hour of 12 at Noon, the peo|ple

flocked to the place of Execution, which
is half a mile Engli&s;h without the Gates,
the Pri&s;oner came on foot with a Divine

repentance; and becau&s;e death &s;hould

like a Top or Whirly-gig; then he
took it by the Spoaks, and lifting it up,
with a mighty &s;troke, he beat one of the
poor wretches legs in pieces (the bones
I mean) at which he rored grievou&s;ly,
then after a little pau&s;e he breaks the o|ther

breaks his arms, and then he

the various nature of the offences that
are committed; as for example, he
that counterfeits any Princes Coin, and
is proved a Coiner, his judgment is to
be boiled to death in Oil; not thrown
into the Ve&s;&s;el all at once, but with a
pulley or a rope, to be hanged under the
Arm-pits, and let down into the Oil by
degrees; fir&s;t the feet, and next the
legs, and &s;o to boil his fle&s;h from the
bones alive. For tho&s;e that &s;et hou&s;es
on fire wilfully, they are &s;moaked to
death; as fir&s;t there is a pile or po&s;t fix|ed
<PB N="156" REF="87">
in the ground, and within an Engli&s;h
Ell of it is a piece of Wood nailed cro&s;s,
whereupon the offender is made fa&s;t &s;it|ting,
then over the top of the po&s;t is
whelmed a great tub or dry fat, which
doth cover or over-whelm the pri&s;oner
as low as the middle. Then underneath
the executioner hath wet &s;traw, hay,
&s;tubble, or &s;uch kind of &s;tuffe, which is
fired, but by rea&s;on it is wet and dank,
it doth not burn, but &s;mother and
&s;moak, which &s;moak a&s;cends up into the
Tub, where the pri&s;oners head is, and
not being able to &s;peak, he will heave up
and down with his belly, and people
may perceive him in the&s;e torments to
live three or four hours.</P>
<P>Adultery there if it be proved, is
puni&s;hed with death, as the lo&s;s of the
parties heads, if they be both marryed,
or if not both, yet the marryed party
mu&s;t die for it, and the other mu&s;t en|dure
&s;ome ea&s;ier puni&s;hment, either by

proves little better then half a hang|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="87">

tho&s;e that are not hanged for

bells he hath hanged at an Iron above

he is a free-man again, &s;ome of the

<HEAD>A Pretty Story.</HEAD>
<P>THe Hangmans place being void,
there were two of the bloud (for
it is to be noted that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the office doth lineally de&s;cend from
the Father to the Son, or to the next
<PB N="158" REF="88">
of the bloud) which were at &s;trife for
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this high indignity.
Now it happened that two men were to
be beheaded at the &s;ame Town, and at
the &s;ame time, and (to avoid &s;uit in
Law for this great Prerogative) it was
concluded by the Arbitrators, that
each of the&s;e new hangmen &s;hould exe|cute
one of the pri&s;oners, and he that
with greate&s;t cunning and &s;light could
take the head from the body, &s;hould
have the place; to this they all agreed,
and the pri&s;oners were brought forth,
where one of the executioners did bind
a Red &s;ilk thred double about his pri&s;o|ners
neck, the threds being di&s;tant one
from another but the breadth of one
thred, and he promi&s;ed to cut off the
head with a backward blow with a
&s;word, between the threds. The other
called his pri&s;oner a&s;ide, and told him
that if he would be ruled by him, he
&s;hould have his life &s;aved, and be&s;ides
(quoth he) I &s;hall be &s;ure to have the
office. The pri&s;oner was glad of the
<PB N="159" REF="88">
motion, and &s;aid he would do any thing
upon the&s;e conditions, then &s;aid the
hang-man, when thou art on thy
knees, and ha&s;t &s;aid thy prayers, and that
I do lift up my Axe (for I will u&s;e an
Axe) to &s;trike thee, I will cry <HI>Hem,</HI> at
which word do thou ri&s;e and run away
(thou knowe&s;t none will &s;tay thee if
thou can&s;t once e&s;cape after thou art de|livered
into my cu&s;tody; it is the fa&s;hion
of our Country) and let me alone to
&s;hift to an&s;wer the matter. This being
&s;aid or whi&s;pered, the heads-man with
the &s;word did cut off the pri&s;oners head
ju&s;t between the threds as he had &s;aid,
which made all the people wonder at
the &s;teddine&s;s of his hand, and mo&s;t of
them judged that he was the man that
was and would be fitte&s;t to make a mad
hang-man of.</P>
<P>But as one tale is good till another
be told, and as there be three degrees
of good, better and be&s;t, &s;o this la&s;t
hang-man did much exceed and eclip&s;e
the others cunning; For his pri&s;oner be|ing
<PB N="160" REF="89">
on his knees, and he lifting up his
Axe to give the fatal blow, <HI>Hem</HI> (&s;aid
he according to promi&s;e) whereupon
the fellow aro&s;e and ran away, but when
he had run &s;ome &s;even or eight paces,
the hang-man threw the Axe after him,
and &s;truck his head &s;moothly from his
&s;houlders: Now for all this, who &s;hall
have the place is unknown, for they are
yet in Law for it, and I doubt not but
before the matter is ended, that the
Lawyers will make them exerci&s;e their
own Trade upon them&s;elves to end the

that would with&s;tand the fury of their
in&s;ulting pride, whereupon they out of
the City came, and entred the <HI>Romans</HI>
Army like a flood, and in their de&s;pe|rate
madne&s;s, all was overwhelmed that
dur&s;t with&s;tand them; the Walls then
could not be a&s;&s;aulted, the enemies
fearful Engines was then by them &s;et on
fire, and bravely fighting they bravely
made their enemies to retire!</P>
<P>The Battel done, back go the&s;e hair|braind
men, and divide again, and each
becomes the others foe, and then pell
mell they go to it, and begin to di&s;or|der,
and bring all things to confu&s;ion;
with fire their Corn and Victuals they
con&s;umed, all their provi&s;ion in a mo|ment
&s;poiled and wa&s;ted, which if well
kept, might have la&s;ted them many
years; upon which the Famine, like a
Tyrant, roams and rages, and makes
all, both Old and Young, Rich and
Poor to &s;tarve and dye with fle&s;hle&s;s A|natomies.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="95">
This was a Plague of Plagues, a Woe
of Woes, death on every &s;ide did in|clo&s;e
them; this being their condition,
they knew not what to do, to &s;ally forth
they dur&s;t not, for then their lives they
were &s;ure to lo&s;e, to &s;tay within for
want of food they &s;tarved, out they
could not go, for the Gates were &s;hut
and &s;trongly warded, their throats were
cut if any &s;taid within; &s;o that if they
&s;tay or go, or go or &s;tay, every way De|&s;truction
they are &s;ure to meet with.</P>
<P>But of all torments, hunger is the
wor&s;t, for that will bur&s;t through the
&s;tony Walls; therefore the&s;e people
having been with War, Woe, and want
on every &s;ide be&s;et, do now begin to con|&s;ult
and &s;trive how they might get to the
<HI>Romans,</HI> for there was their hopes, that
in their &s;words they &s;hould find more
mercy, then their &s;till dying fami&s;ht
&s;tate afforded them: And indeed when
man is oppre&s;t, then is wit mo&s;t &s;harpe&s;t,
and then wi&s;dom among&s;t evils, chu&s;eth
the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="95">
Now they knowing <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> for a
noble Prince, and one that did not glo|ry
in their Woe, they thought it be&s;t
to try his clemency, and not with hun|ger
and famine to die, and therefore de|&s;pairing
of all hopes, re&s;olved with
Ropes to &s;lide down the Walls, which
a number of them did, and fled to <HI>Titus,</HI>
who bemoaned the &s;adne&s;s of their con|dition,
and relieved and took them to
his grace and favour. Thus when
all hopes failed, they were by their foes
pre&s;erved, to the number of at lea&s;t
40000.</P>
<P>The City Souldiers &s;earched every
hou&s;e where they thought any Victuals
were conveyed, and if they found
any, the owners were mo&s;t certainly bea|ten
for concealing it; but if they &s;aw a
man look plump and fat, his throat they
would &s;urely cut, for they thought
him too much pampered, and too full
fed; they would therefore &s;trike him
dead to &s;ave meat and drink. The
Riche&s;t and Noble&s;t that was born both
<PB N="174" REF="96">
of Men and Women, gave all they had
for one poor &s;trike of Corn, and hid
them&s;elves and it under the ground in
&s;ome clo&s;e Vault, and there they would
eat it under the ground unground; if
any could get fle&s;h, they would eat it
raw: Thus the weaker were over-awed,
and kept under by the &s;tronger.</P>
<P>No re&s;pect of per&s;ons where hunger
came; natural affection was then bani&s;h|ed;
then the Husband did his own Wife
reject, the Wife &s;he &s;natches the meat
from her Husband, all pity from the
Mother was exiled, &s;he from the Child
tears and takes the Victuals, the Child
plays the thief with the Parents, and
&s;teals the food, though with grief the
Parents pine away.</P>
<P>There was neither Free-man, nor
Bond-man, Fathers nor Mothers, Wives,
Husbands, Ma&s;ters, Servants, Brothers,
Si&s;ters, be it propinquity or &s;trong affi|nity,
no Law, or rea&s;on, or rule could
bear &s;way; and indeed obey&s;ance mu&s;t
be given where &s;trength commands; the

the Son will not &s;hew his duty to
his Father, the Commons regardle&s;s to

cart before the hor&s;e, force cau&s;ed all
re&s;pect to yield.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mi&s;creants with vigilancy did
watch where a door was locked or latch|ed
that they could &s;py, for there they
&s;uppo&s;ed the people were at meat, and
in their out-rage the doors they would
beat open, where entring if they found
them feeding, they would tear it in
ha&s;te out of their throats, half eaten
and half uneaten; the&s;e wretches would
con&s;train the people to ca&s;t it up again,
they hauld them about the hou&s;e by the
ears, to force them to bring out their
Victuals, which they &s;uppo&s;ed they had;
&s;ome by the Thumbs they hanged up,
and &s;ome by the Toes, &s;ome had many
blows, others were pricked with Bod|kins,
&s;adly were they tormented to re|veal
their meat when they had none to

came into their net, and all was food
that could be got by fraud or force.</P>
<P>Gra&s;s, Hay, Barks, Leaves of trees,
Cats and Dogs, Frogs, Worms, Rats,

<P>This Famine run beyond all natures
bounds, (as before I have hinted) and
confounded all Motherly-affection, no
compa&s;&s;ion was there had to bloud or

Son, &s;he ript and di&s;-joynted him, and
di&s;-joynted him limb from limb, &s;he
dre&s;t, &s;he roa&s;ted, &s;he broiled and boil|ed
him, &s;he eat him, &s;he interr'd him in
her womb; his life by nature proceed|ed
from her, and &s;he her &s;elf mo&s;t unna|turally
did feed upon him, he was her
<PB N="177" REF="97">
fle&s;h, her bloud, her bones, and there|fore
&s;he eating him her &s;elf, her &s;elf
made food: No woe can equal her mi|&s;ery,
no grief can match her &s;ad cala|mities,
the Souldiers they &s;melt the
meat, upon which they &s;traitly a&s;&s;em|bled,
which when they &s;aw, they trem|bled,
and with &s;taring hairs, and gha&s;t|ly
looks were thereat &s;o affrighted and
amazed, that thereupon they pre&s;ently
left the hou&s;e: This horrid action did
more with them, then any force of man

<P>Oh then thou that do&s;t live like a

never leaves to feed and quaff. Think
on <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> perhaps it will move
thee in the mid&s;t of thy Diet and rio|tous
cour&s;es, to a more temperate and
&s;ober demeanor.</P>
<P>And you brave Dames, adorned
with Jems and Jewels, that mu&s;t have
Grewels and Caudles, Con&s;erves and
Marchpanes, &amp; that too in &s;undry &s;hapes
made, as Ca&s;tles, Towers, Hor&s;es, Apes,
and Bears; think on <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the
mid&s;t of all your glory, and then you
will be more &s;orrowful and le&s;s dainty;
poor <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had once Beauty,
Strength, Riches, &s;pacious Buildings,
Authority and honour, yet the&s;e avail|ed
them nothing, wrong trode down
right, and Ju&s;tice was quite forgotten,
which was their chiefe&s;t, their greate&s;t,
their only earthly good.</P>
<P>But now one little piece of bread
they reckoned more upon, then ever
before they did of bags of Gold. Scraps,
parings, and fragments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which your
full &s;ed Corps did u&s;ually fling away,
<PB N="179" REF="98">
with them had been a ran&s;om for a
King, the loath&s;ome garbage which our
dogs refu&s;e, had been among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI>
a di&s;h of &s;tate.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t within Famine plaid the Ty|rant,
the <HI>Romans</HI> Army &s;trived to win
the Walls, their Pioners, and all their
Engines were at work to batter and a&s;|&s;ault
the Wall: Now note, <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
had three &s;trong &s;tone Walls, and long
it was ere the <HI>Romans</HI> could get one, but
the dearth &s;o &s;pread, and death of the
&s;word, as that in the &s;treets the living
trod upon the dead, the Carka&s;&s;es which
the Seditious kill'd, fill'd many great
hou&s;es, &s;o that with the &s;tinck of bodies
putrefied there dyed a number number|le&s;s
of people, for burial they afforded
none, but where they fell they let them
lye &s;tink and rot, yet very un&s;en&s;ible
were they of the &s;ad condition of each
other, by hundreds and thou&s;ands: then
did the &s;ouldiers throw their livele&s;s
Corp&s;es over the Walls, upon this and
their di&s;-uniting, the <HI>Romans</HI> had high
<PB N="180" REF="99">
advantages, and could with more &s;ecuri|ty
batter and &s;cale the Walls.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;aw their di&s;mal
fall from the Walls, they told it to <HI>Ti|tus&punc;</HI>
which when he perceived he wept,
and lifted up his hands to Heaven and
called on God to witne&s;s with him this.</P>
<P>The&s;e flanghters &s;aith he, were no
thoughts of mine, neither was it my
fault. Indeed tho&s;e wretches that e|&s;caped
from out of the City, and came
among&s;t their foes in my Army, found
both relief and pity, if any of tho&s;e that
fled to my Army had by the Seditious
been caught, they had without remor&s;e
&s;trook them dead.</P>
<P>But another mi&s;ery I mu&s;t unfold un|to
you, many <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;wallowed &s;tore
of Gold, which they &s;uppo&s;ed in their
need &s;hould help them, but from
this trea&s;ure did their bane proceed, the
Gold was the cau&s;e that many of them
peri&s;ht, among&s;t them all, one unhappy
poor creature went privately to do the
needs of Nature, and in his dung he
<PB N="181" REF="99">
looked for his Gold, where being by the
&s;traggling &s;ouldiers took, they ript him
up and &s;earched his Maw, to find what
Gold or trea&s;ure there remained: In this
&s;ort was many a Man and Woman ript
and &s;lain for the gain of Gold that the
&s;ouldiers gaped for. In &s;ome they
found Gold, in many none, but had they
Gold or not, it was all one with them,
they were unbowelled and &s;earched
mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly whither they had any
or no.</P>
<P>But my &s;tory briefly to conclude, <HI>Ve|&s;pa&s;ians</HI>
Souldiers had &s;ubdued the walls,
&amp; his triumphant banner was di&s;played,
and that in the mid&s;t of the &s;treets, at
which the <HI>Jews</HI> were all di&s;mayed, and
upon which they de&s;perately did retire
to the Temple, which with ungodly
hands they &s;et on fire; which noble <HI>Ti|tus</HI>
with great care intreated them
they would &s;pare: Oh &s;ave the
hou&s;e (quoth he) and I will &s;pare you
for the Temple &s;ake, quench the fire,
<PB N="182" REF="100">
put out the flame! Oh let not after|times
report that you have burnt the
worlds unmatchable glory! For your
own &s;akes, your wives, and your chil|drens,
if from <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ians</HI> hands you ex|pect
grace, if from <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ians</HI> hands you
expect your lives; oh &s;ave your Temple,
<HI>Titus</HI> doth command you to &s;ave the
Temple.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> heard of the mercy they
might have had, but with hearts hard
they refu&s;ed the offer, they refu&s;ed mer|cy,
and them&s;elves regarded not; but in
their madne&s;s they burned, con&s;umed
and confounded to the ground King
<HI>Solomons</HI> great Temple, that Temple
which did co&s;t thirty Millions, was in a
moment lo&s;t and con&s;umed. The ble&s;t
<HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> the holie&s;t place of|ten
ble&s;&s;ed with <HI>Johovahs</HI> &s;acred grace,
where as the Text &s;aith, were 22000 Ox|en
&s;lain, and 12000 &s;heep be&s;ides, dyed
at the &s;ame time for an oblation.
That hou&s;e of God who&s;e glorious fame
<PB N="183" REF="100">
made all the World to wonder, was
burnt, and ran&s;ackt, and laid level to the
ground, which when it was &s;een by <HI>Ve|&s;pa&s;ian</HI>
and young <HI>Titus,</HI> they cry'd kill,
kill tho&s;e wretched <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;pare not to
kill, u&s;e &s;peedy and Mar&s;hal Law; the
<HI>Roman</HI> &s;ouldiers then fell on and &s;pared
none, they &s;lew while they were weary
of &s;laying, and had no re&s;pect to Age or
Sex, the &s;treets were drowned in bloud,
and &s;laughtered-Carka&s;es did &s;wim in
in bloud, the able&s;t men that were &s;aved
they carryed away for &s;laves, <HI>John, Si|mon,</HI>
and <HI>Eleazer,</HI> as they de&s;erved were
brought to violent ends.</P>
<P>Now from that time that the <HI>Romans</HI> began
their &s;iege, until the City was won by Sedition,
by the Sword, Fire, and Famine, were depri|ved
of their lives eleven hundred thou&s;and, be|&s;ides
one hundred thou&s;and were taken as
bea&s;ts and &s;old for &s;laves, and from the time it
was fir&s;t erected, till the <HI>Romans</HI> had take<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> it,
it &s;tood as appears in Hi&s;tories twenty one
hundred &s;eventy and nine years.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="101">
But before Gods vengeance was &s;howred
down upon them, what &s;trange prodigious
Wonders did he &s;hew, as warnings how they
&s;hould avoid their de&s;truction, and cau&s;e them
to repent the wicked evils they had done.</P>
<P>1. The Firmament &s;hewed them a Comet
like a fiery Sword.</P>
<P>2. Divers nights the Temple and the Altar
were environed with bright burning lights.</P>
<P>3. In the mid&s;t of the Temple though un|a
Cow did bear a Lamb.</P>
<P>4. No Bolts or Bars could re&s;train the
Temple-gates, but they would fly open of
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>5. In the Air a&s;&s;embled Armed men and
Chariots, the pondrous Earth quaked, affright|ed
and trembled.</P>
<P>6. To this &s;en&s;e a voice cryed in the Temple,
&amp; the people cry'd oh let us from hence depart!</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;upernatural accidents, foretold &s;ome
fearful Judgment was to come, but toyes they
were accounted to the <HI>Jews,</HI> or &s;car-crow-bug|bears
to fright children with, and not minding
them, nor no way by them being affrighted,
they did in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;ecurely revell, they
thought the&s;e &s;igns were again&s;t their foes, and
not them.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="101">
But when war, when death, when &s;poil, when
ruine had &s;torm'd them, appear'd the place &s;o
de&s;olate as none could have known there had
been a City.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Juda,</HI> and thus <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> fell, which
Chri&s;t did foretell, and was now fulfill'd, that all
their joys they &s;hould be bereft off, and that
one &s;tone &s;hould not be left to &s;tand upon ano|ther.</P>
