<HEAD>A true RELATION OF The reducing of the City of NAPLES to the obedience of the King of SPAINE.</HEAD>
<P>_THe troubles of the City of <HI>Naples,</HI> be|gun and continued for the&s;e tenne moneths &s;pace, with &s;o great a de&s;tru|ction &amp; revolution of almo&s;t the whole Kingdome, to the great di&s;traction of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> forces, and prejudice not onely of that peace of <HI>Italy,</HI> but e|ven of the univer&s;all peace &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all Chri&s;tendome, which troubles were fomented partly by the <HI>French,</HI> who in all diligence were preparing a &s;uccour of foure thou&s;and foote, and eight hundred hor&s;e; partly by the private intelligence and practi|&s;es with the <HI>Turke</HI> to invite him to the ruine of all <HI>Jtaly.</HI> It plea&s;ed his divine Maje&s;ty, to end in a happy and much de&s;i|red peace, and this with &s;o much ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;peed, that he who&s;e under&s;tanding is not blinded, cannot chu&s;e but con|fe&s;&s;e, that Kingdoms, and States, are onely his gifts, who is the God of Hea&s;ts, I may not omit to relate unto you, the
<PB N="2" REF="3"> glorious cata&s;trophe of this Tragedy; for though a more elo|quent pen may undertake it, none &s;hall tell it more ingenu|ou&s;ly, and truely then I will do.</P>
<P>His Excel. therefore the <HI>Coud d'Ognate</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> having been advi&s;ed that the <HI>French</HI> Fleete, was preparing in all diligence to come and &s;uccour the people, and that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not in a &s;ufficient forwardnes to prevent it, and that the leavies made at <HI>Rome,</HI> marched on but &s;lowly, and that even great part of them was of neces&s;ity to &s;top in the way to reinforce the cheif holds in <HI>Abruzzo,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the perpetuall inva&s;ions the <HI>French</HI> made in that province, having already taken &s;ome places, and &s;till reinforcing with new &s;up|plies of Souldiers, Commanders, and ammunition. And fur|ther perceiving that the men he expected from <HI>Milan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> came not, he was extreamly aflicted, apprehending that he &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d not manage his Maje&s;ties affaires with that happyne&s;&s;e as he had promi&s;ed unto him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>Yet de&s;iring at lea&s;t to make his &s;ervice appeare remarkable by &s;ome glorious enterpri&s;e; having vi&s;ited all the fortifica|tions &amp; works the <HI>Spinads</HI> had, &amp; the Ca&s;tle of Saint <HI>Elmo,</HI> providing each with all &s;ort of ammunition; on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;econd day of <HI>Aprill,</HI> he imbarqued wi h the field Ma&s;ter Generall, <HI>Diony&s;io d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gu&s;man,</HI> and other Commanders to goe vi&s;it the I&s;land of <HI>Ni&s;ita,</HI> where he made accompt the French fleet would ca&s;t Anchor; leaving there two peices of Artille|ry, and fifty Spanyards; a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion, as was e&s;teemed, for that time. This &s;erved as an i&s;&s;ue to draw thither the bad humors, and &s;o to free the more noble parts of the body, for the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> re&s;olving to &s;ecure that place where the Fleet he &s;o much longed for, was to an|ker, ha&s;tned with 300. Hor&s;e to the Captaine of <HI>Pu&s;&s;ilipo,</HI> right again&s;t the afore&s;aid I&s;land, that he might there build a Fort which might command it.</P>
<P>This ab&s;ence of the Dukes out of <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;eemed unto his Excellencie a mo&s;t fit opportunity to put in execution the enterpri&s;e hee had de&s;igned. Wherefore not confiding in the weakne&s;&s;e of his armes, but in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected
<PB N="3" REF="3"> from heaven; he re&s;olved in the meane time to give an a&s;|&s;ault upon &s;ome of the Fortifications made by the people. According to which re&s;olution, he gave order, that the Com|manders &s;hould be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, and he demanded a li&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which could be &s;pared for this purpo&s;e; the which he found to bee farre inferior in number to what was nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an enter|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>On Sunday at night, the fifth of the &s;aid Moneth, his Ex|cellency acquainted his Highne&s;&s;e, <HI>Don John d' Au&s;tria</HI> with his de&s;igne, who much approving &s;o generous a re&s;olu ion, &s;ent for the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bility, and laid before them their obligation, and the example his Excellencie gave them, who was come to <HI>Naples,</HI> out of pure obedience, to &s;erve his Catholik Ma|je&s;tie, at a time it &s;eemed to every one impo&s;&s;ible to reduce that people, and part of that Kingdome to their duty, expo|&s;ing his life to &s;o many dangers, for his King and his &s;ubjects, who were there pre&s;ent. And he repre&s;ented al&s;o unto them, the want he had at that time of men, and other provi&s;ions, for &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; wherefore in corre&s;pondence of their af|fection towards him, he required of them all to meet againe &s;ecretly in the &s;ame place, at midnight, with their Armes, and &s;uch tru&s;ty men, as they could lead on an enterpri&s;e, where his Excellencie would appeare in the head of them.</P>
<P>They all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">red their lives in his highne&s;&s;e &s;ervice, as be|came loyall and faithfull va&s;&s;als of his Maje&s;ty. And though in regard the number was &s;o &s;mall, the Enterpri&s;e &s;eemed not only hard but Ra&s;h; yet the Duke of Gui&s;es ab&s;ence gave him hopes of a pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e. But he did mo&s;t of all rely on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected from his Divine Maje&s;tie, who&s;e helpe he commanded all to implore, and for that purpo&s;e or|dered prayer to be made in all the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ches; forbidding all his Souldiers under mo&s;t grevious and exemplar puni&s;hments all &s;orts of exce&s;&s;e, and deboi&s;tnes.</P>
<P>At midnight, the Nobillity met togeather, with tho&s;e they brought along with them; and they di&s;po&s;ed them|&s;elves for the attempt, and marched quietly along
<PB N="4" REF="4"> to Ie&s;us Church; and his highne&s;&s;e would needs accompany them, who togeather with the Count and other Comman|ders entred into the &s;aid Church, where after that they had prayed a while, the Count went forth to &s;ee whether all was ready for the a&s;&s;ault, according as he had appointed, his high|ne&s;&s;e remaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">till in the Church.</P>
<P>And his Excelencie having found all things in order, he told them the &s;igne at which they were to begin their a&s;&s;ault, and &s;o returned back into the Church, and &s;oone after he gave the &s;igne, to fall on the trenches and other workes. The on|&s;et began at the gate called <HI>Porta Alba,</HI> where they found &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance of the People, &amp; &s;ome blood was &s;pilt on both &s;ides. But finally ours brake through, and Marched on to the other gates, which they gain'd without any re&s;i&s;tance; and then they heard them cry out from within the City, <HI>Viva Spagna&punc;</HI> At which acclamation, his Excellencie entred the Ci|ty with his men, and his Highne&s;&s;e expected at the Gates, guarded by the Nobility unto whom he gave expre&s;&s;e com|mand not to enter without his Order.</P>
<P>Upon his Excelences arrivall, the &s;ame acclamations en|crea&s;ed, and many of the more civill &s;ort of people accom|panied him with their &s;words drawn, crying out all in one voice; <HI>God &s;ave the King, our Soueraigne.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Cardinall, Archbi&s;hop <HI>Filomarino,</HI> mett him in Coache, and his Exelencie al&s;o lighted; But pre&s;ently both of them got up againe on Hor&s;back. And &s;oone after came the chiefe man among&s;t the people, called <HI>the Elect of the People,</HI> who ca&s;ting him&s;elfe at the <HI>Condes</HI> feete, crying out with a loud voyce, that in the name of all the people, he came to tender him obedience, as to the Kings Vice-roy, whom God pre&s;erve. His Excellency under&s;tanding who he was, bade him ri&s;e, and get up on hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>And pa&s;sing by the Pri&s;ons, he commanded all the pri&s;o|ners to be &s;et free, except onely the French, the cau&s;e of who&s;e impri&s;onment he would fir&s;t know, before he would let them enjoy the favour.</P>
<P>Being come to the Market-place, his Excellency found &s;uch
<PB N="5" REF="4"> a multitude of people, that he could &s;carce break through, and it &s;eemed a ra&s;hne&s;&s;e to adventure it. But His Excellency made his way, the people crying out with acclamations of joy and prai&s;e, upon the King and Count.</P>
<P>And &s;o he came to the great Tower to the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> where <HI>Iennaro Anne&s;&s;e,</HI> the Peoples cheife Commander, made a &s;hew of re&s;i&s;ting; but pre&s;ently demanded that three of the Nobility whom he a&s;ked for by name, would come. But the&s;e being ab&s;ent, as remaining &s;till with his highne&s;&s;e, the Arch-Bi&s;hop went up fir&s;t, and then the Count; and after a &s;hort time, tho&s;e within came all down; and they pre&s;ented to His Excellency the keys of the Tower, who gave them to keep to <HI>Don Alvaro della Torre.</HI></P>
<P>His Highne&s;&s;e was now acquainted from His Excellency of the happine&s;&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and that he might freely come forward. He did &s;o: and being arrived, with the Nobility nigh the Tower, <HI>Genna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o Anne&s;e,</HI> as he was in&s;tructed by the Count, ca&s;t him&s;elf at his feet.</P>
<P>But his Highne&s;&s;e having &s;et at liberty, the Duke of <HI>Turci</HI> and his Nephew, who were Pri&s;oners, entred with all his trea&s;ure into the <HI>Carmelites</HI> Church, and cau&s;ed the <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be &s;ong. After which, his Highne&s;&s;e mounted on Hor&s;e|backe, and accompanied with all the Nobility, he rode about the Citie, with an incredible joy to all the people, who cried out, not onely in the &s;treets, but al&s;o out of the windowes, <HI>Viva Spagna,</HI> be&s;towing freely on the Souldiers a refre&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>The Ceremonie ended, the Archbi&s;hop went home, and his Highne&s;&s;e, and his followers retyred to the Palace; &s;till accompanied with the &s;ignes of a common joy, and acclama|tions of the people, which la&s;ted for divers dayes, crying out, <HI>God &s;ave the King of Spaine, and the Count of Ognale, who hath brought us this Peace.</HI> Before his Highne&s;&s;e was come to the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> hou&s;e, the people had &s;acked it, without doing any further harme to any creature.</P>
<P>The notice of this happy &s;ucce&s;&s;e being brought to <HI>Capua, Luys Roderico,</HI> Governour of the Armes in tho&s;e parts, mar|ched
<PB N="6" REF="5"> out with 1500. Foot, and tooke S. <HI>Maria de Capua;</HI> where having under&s;tood, whither the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> was fled, he gave order to <HI>Don Pro&s;pero Tutt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">villo,</HI> and <HI>D. Toma|&s;o Guiria&s;o</HI> to lay wait for him with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e, who lighting on the Duke, tooke him Pri&s;oner, ond brought him to the Fort of <HI>Capua,</HI> with 25. of his followers.</P>
<P>Vpon the newes, many Cities round about returned to their Kings obedience; and it is hoped the re&s;t will do the &s;ame, even in <HI>Abruzzo</HI> where the French have mo&s;t footing, and have &s;trengthened &s;ome places, having taken 2. daies be|fore the City of Aquila, from whence they battered the Fort, the which was otherwi&s;e well provided except of men, foure thou&s;and together with the Governour being marched out to &s;uccour <HI>Pe&s;cara,</HI> a Fort of very great importance.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tory of an exploit, which may be accompted miraculous, not only in regard of the afore&s;aid circum&s;tances, but al&s;o for hapning on <HI>Palme-Sunday,</HI> the day of our Savi|ours Triumph; by who&s;e particular protection, the Catho|like King hath obtained this favour.</P>
<P>Together with the impri&s;onment of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> and libertie of the Duke of <HI>Tur&s;is.</HI></P>
