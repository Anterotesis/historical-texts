<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Parliament of Scotland begins to di&s;play the banner of great Politicians, and have taken an Oath of Secre&s;ie not to impart or di&s;clo&s;e the re&s;ults of their debates til all things come to maturity and ripene&s;&s;e: all their con&s;ul|tations tends to the purging of the Army, adhering to their Covenant, and maintaining their Government by a mixt Mo|narchy of King, Lords, and Commons; and in order there|unto,
<PB N="2" REF="3">the major part have entred into prote&s;t, and declared, in the name of all the Commons of that Kingdom, That they will (to the utmo&s;t of their power) endeavour the pre&s;er|vation of the peace and tranquility thereof, again&s;t all op|po&s;ition or power what&s;oever, and that they will likewi&s;e endeavour the true e&s;tabli&s;hing of a firm and un&s;potted Mo|narchy <HI>(which can hardly be)</HI> according to the ancient Lawes Liberties and Cu&s;tome of that Kingdom, and doth further remon&s;trate exceeding high language again&s;t the Parlia|ment of <HI>England,</HI> in reference to the late Kings execution, &amp; their pre&s;ent tran&s;actions between Parliament and Army: But their young Kings An&s;wer &s;eeming un&s;atisfactory to the de&s;ires of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Kirk, cau&s;eth them rather to pray for his Conver&s;ion; then advi&s;e his Confor|mity.</P>
<P>However, the vulgar &s;ort of people &s;eem to re&s;cent his conde&s;cen&s;ions, and &s;ay, that unle&s;&s;e their plants receive moi|&s;ture from the &s;ap of the Cedar, the bark and pith of the poor Shrub will fade and decay.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that tyrannicall Oppre&s;&s;ors have received an allarum throughout all Ages, with the de&s;perate Careers of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed multitude, who no &s;ooner enter by &s;torme, but they make their enemies (though never &s;o great) drink the dregs of their cup of fury, and not only &s;o, but leaves them and their I&s;&s;ue, odious to all po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But its hoped that tho&s;e who keep their Trophies of <HI>Vic|toria</HI> by love, will challenge a high applau&s;e of Chri&s;tiani|ty and Souldiery, and attempt de&s;perate adventures for the bringing of their oppre&s;&s;ors to a &s;peedy ruine; notwith&s;tan|ding all their forraign machaviliani&s;m, to a new involving; It being apparent that their pre&s;ent actings beyond the Seas, tends to the univer&s;all de&s;truction of the well-affected par|ty throughout the three Nations; the which, that it may ap|pear
<PB N="4" REF="3">more vi&s;ible to your &s;tately Fabrick and renowned Metropolis, I &s;hall here repre&s;ent unto the Ornaments and Inhabitants thereof, a perfect Demon&s;tration and Declara|tion of the proceedings of the King of Scots and his Adhe|rents, in reference to an engagement again&s;t them; to the end they may receive a timely allarum, for a ananimous a&s;&s;oci|ation, with tho&s;e renowned Tru&s;tees, who have &s;o deerly purcha&s;ed their liberties; the &s;um and ab&s;tract whereof I &s;hall here in&s;ert as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>We hear that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> hath &s;ent an additio|nall Fleet to the Zund, to intercept and fall upon the Engli&s;h &s;hips at their return from the Ea&s;t Country; and for cer|tain it is, that both the Scots and others have them in a uni|ver&s;all hatred.</P>

<P>THe Marq. of Ormond with <HI>13000</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot is &s;ate down before the City of Dublin, with a re&s;olution to storm, if not &s;uddenly &s;urrendred upon &s;ummons; but renowned Col. Jones hath taken a re&s;olution to fight it out to the last man, and hath already made a gallant attempt and inroad vpon his Outquartes with <HI>2000</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot; and after a &s;harp conflict Col. <HI>Jones</HI> made an honourable retreat in|to the City with the lo&s;se of <HI>7</HI> or <HI>8,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome &s;ew wounded; but the Lord <HI>Inchiquins</HI> Brigade of hor&s;e being gallantly moun|ted, took vpon them great re&s;olution, and embraced the pur&s;uit within a quarter of a mile of the Gates, where we had a &s;econd engagement, which continued very dubious for the &s;pace of half an hour, till at last a con&s;iderable party of the Sea-men came in to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who by their lining of the hedges, did &s;o gall the Enemy, that they were forced to retreat, leaving above <HI>30</HI> men dead vpon the place; in which fight we took Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> Cornet <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and about ten more pri&s;oners, with the lo&s;se of five men.</P>
<P>Since which time, they have made another attempt vpon our Out-guards, and vpon the neer approoch of their forlorn hope con&s;i&s;ting of about <HI>60</HI> hor&s;e, <HI>30</HI> of ours an&s;wered their charge, and &s;hot Lieut. Col. <HI>Dungans</HI> hor&s;e vnder him, took him pri&s;o|ner, and Major <HI>Dungan</HI> his brother was mortally wounded, our men brought off <HI>7</HI> of their hor&s;e, and (ble&s;sed be God) but one man wounded, none &s;lain.</P>
<P>They are incamped within a mile and a half of the City, where they expect the coming vp of the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> Lord <HI>Taff,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Dillon,</HI> with their forces, for a &s;udden con|junction; and then to make a &s;harp &s;torm.</P>
<P>Their Tents are pitcht on this &s;ide <HI>Fingles,</HI> their hor&s;e and foot lye all in our &s;ight; Col. <HI>Jones</HI> is labouring hard to fortifie against them, hath given Orders for the pulling down all the Outhou&s;es that may advantage their de&s;ign, and hath &s;et forth Proclamation for all the Iri&s;h Papists, and other di&s;affected
<PB REF="4">Citizens, to depart the City within <HI>12</HI> hours after the publi&s;h|ing thereof; by who&s;e unwearied pains and vigilancy, we are in &s;ome rea&s;onable po&s;&s;ibility of the more &s;afety thereby, &amp; have hard duty to attend the Line dayly, but great will, vigour and eadine&s;se is in all men to perform the &s;ervice: We have about <HI>7000</HI> foot (with the Inhabitants) fighting men, and about <HI>500</HI> hor&s;e to face the enemy: Our provi&s;ions con&s;ume very fast, and every thing is exce&s;&s;ive dear, having now neither fi&s;h nor fle&s;h to come to our Markets, the enemy being po&s;se&s;sed of that which &s;hould relieve us; and are in a pro&s;perous condition at pre&s;ent, and like to do what they plea&s;e if our friends in England do not relieve us &s;uddenly, and mo|cey to pay them and tho&s;e that are already here, and more provi&s;ions for them all, for Wheat is here at <HI>5. li. 10. s.</HI> the quarter, Rye at <HI>4. li. 10. s.</HI> the quarter, little to &s;ell, and little money to buy it, our Men of War are come from Bewmorris, and divers &s;hips from Che&s;ter, and no men nor money, it is impo&s;&s;ible (in mans judgment) for us to hold out till ayd comes from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We have lost the good Town of <HI>Kildare,</HI> but it co&s;t the enemy ve|ry deer; for after three or four de&s;perate a&s;&s;aults made by them on the breaches, made by their Canon, having lost many of their men they &s;ent for a parley, and ob&s;erving the undauted re&s;olution of Lies Col. <HI>Hute&s;on</HI> and Cap. <HI>Dixon,</HI> who commanded the men there, &amp; mo- of the men vnder them, although many of their men would not figh&s;t at all, &amp; are &s;ince gone to the enemy, that they gave our men quartet in two dayes to carry away what they had, where was great &s;tore of corr and meal, Balle&s;oman is be&s;ieged, and it must be lo&s;t becau&s;e we can|not come to relieve them.</P>
<P>We hear that <HI>Owen Oneal</HI> with his forces is joyned with them of <HI>Kilkenny</HI> against us, but we have no certainty thereof. We are in a very &s;ad condition, all our provi&s;ions being almo&s;t all &s;pent, yet I hope the Lord will defend this place, and that every one that puts his tru&s;t in him &s;hall be delivered, to who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed protection I commend you, and re&s;t ever,</P>
