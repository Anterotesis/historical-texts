<HEAD>NEGRO PONTE, <HI>Anciently called</HI> EUBOEA.</HEAD>
<P>IT Lyes to the North of Boeotia extending North We&s;t and South Ea&s;t about 120 miles; Its Breadth, at the broade&s;t place not above 30. It was taken from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the year 1471. The &s;oil is very fertile, affording all &s;orts of Graine, Wine, and Oyle, as likewi&s;e Fle&s;h and Fowl; the Sea abounding with Fi&s;h. Since the <HI>Turks</HI> have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, mo&s;t of the <HI>Greeks</HI> are Fled from the Villages, and Townes; So as the inland places are mo&s;tly &s;upplyed by <HI>Al|bane&s;es,</HI> who are the Shepherds, and &s;erve the <HI>Turks</HI> at their Farmes. Formerly here were two Citys, and 500. Townes and Villages; Now there is but one, which can be called a City, which is the ancient <HI>Chalcis</HI> and now hath the name of the I&s;land; by the <HI>Turks</HI> it is called <HI>Egriboz.</HI> It &s;tands on a point of Land, having the Sea two Thirds about it. Betwixt it and the Maine is a &s;mall I&s;land, with a &s;trong Ca&s;tle. From the Maine to the &s;mall I&s;land is a bridge built up|on &s;ix good Arches, and thence to the Maine
<PB N="2" REF="4">Ca&s;tle is a draw-bridge about 30 yards Long. The Maine Ca&s;tle is two miles in compa&s;s, for|tified with &s;ix very large Towers, or Rondells; The walls are high and thick with a dry ditch to the Land, which is almo&s;t filled up with rub|bi&s;h. To the South of the Ca&s;tle is a new Platt-Forme with &s;everall very large Gunns, which carry &s;tone Shot of about 18 inches diameter. When I was there in the year 1676. a Renegado was taken; He was a Greek born on the I&s;land of <HI>Candy;</HI> &amp; turned Turk when the <HI>Vizier</HI> was at the Siege of <HI>Candy;</HI> afterwards he marryed at <HI>Scio,</HI> and lived very well; but upon &s;ome di&s;content he made his e&s;cape from <HI>Scio,</HI> and got to the Privateers of <HI>Malta,</HI> with whom he lived &s;ome years; &amp; landing on this I&s;land, he with &s;ome others were &s;urpriz|ed, and taken. His companions were condemned to the Gallys, but his &s;entence was to be &s;hott away, out of one of the&s;e great Gunns, which was accordingly effected.</P>
<P>None but <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> live within the Ca|&s;tle, where are very &s;pacious hou&s;es, and four which de&s;erve the name of <HI>Seraglios;</HI> One for the Ba&s;ha, at the right hand coming into the Ca&s;tle from the Port; One for his Lievetenant or Ki|ahja; a Third belonging to <HI>Ibrahim Aga</HI>'s Son (of who&s;e Father we will &s;peak anon;) and the Fourth, to <HI>Muzlee Aga;</HI> Which are very richly &s;et out with carved work and painting. At the
<PB N="3" REF="4">latter I was very often entertained upon the fol|lowing account. <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI> was taken a Slave in the year 1660, &amp; &s;old at <HI>Legorne,</HI> where he conti|nued &s;everal years, and &s;erved as a Porter about the Streets, paying his Ma&s;ter dayly what he got. He won the favour of M^r. <HI>William Mico</HI> (an Engli&s;h Merchant) who be&s;ides his due, would often give him &s;ome &s;mall matter, &amp; recommend|ed him to others of his friends. <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI> con|fiding in M^r <HI>Mico,</HI> imparts the circum&s;tances of his pre&s;ent condition to him, telling him he had good freinds, who would redeem him, and withall de&s;ired M^r. <HI>Mico</HI> to u&s;e his intere&s;t with his Patron, to be moderate in exacting his Ran|&s;om, giving him a Letter, to be &s;ent to his friends at <HI>Negro Ponte,</HI> but without his Patron's know|ledge. M^r. <HI>Mico</HI> pur&s;uant to his humble Ad|dre&s;s, did obtaine his ran&s;om on ea&s;y terms. Soon after orders came from <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI>'s freinds to buy his ran&s;om for five hundred pie|ces of Eight, which they would pay at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Which was &s;hort by two hundred of what was agreed for. Upon <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI>'s obligation M^r. <HI>Mico</HI> frees him, and &s;ends him to <HI>Smyrna</HI> to M^r. <HI>Richard Langly;</HI> in who&s;e hou&s;e he tarried, un|till the remainder of the mony was &s;ent him, which he paid, and went to his friends. I then lived at <HI>Smyrna</HI> with Mr. <HI>Langley;</HI> And now being at <HI>Negro Ponte</HI> &s;itting in the Coffee
<PB N="4" REF="5">hou&s;e, one morning, I ob&s;erved him to look ve|ry often on me, and ri&s;ing from his place he came to me, asking me what Country man I was, from whence I came, and whether I was going. I told him that I was an Engli&s;h man, come from <HI>Patra&s;s,</HI> and was going to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI> Then, &s;ays he, you are the Man I took you for, and I thank God, that I have an oppor|tunity to requite the kindne&s;&s;es, that I have re|ceived from your Nation. He would often have me to eat with him. In the year 1679. I was here again, coming from <HI>Athens</HI> I was robb'd by &s;ome <HI>Albane&s;es. Muzlee Aga</HI> gets me pa&s;&s;age on a <HI>Lundra</HI> (built in form like a Galley, more for burthen, and &s;ayling, than rowing) for <HI>Scio,</HI> &s;end|ing aboard 6 henns, 10 oakes, (an oak is about two pound eight ounces Engli&s;h) of white Bisket, 10 oakes of Wine, a Jarr of Olives, and a Jarr of Pettme&s;h, recommending me to the <HI>Reys</HI> (or Ma|&s;ter) &s;aying, <HI>I recommend this man to you, when you &s;ee him, you &s;ee me, what you do to him, you do for me, and I will an&s;wer it, be it good or ill.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their fine hou&s;es in the Ca|&s;tle, the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> has a very large hou&s;e to the NW^t. of the Ca&s;tle, near the Gally Haven. In the Ca|&s;tle are two Mo&s;ques; the one was a Church de|dicated to S^t. <HI>Mark.</HI> There are &s;everall Wells, but mo&s;t of the water which &s;erves to drink is brought in with Jarrs. About a furlong from
<PB N="5" REF="5">the Ca&s;tle, is the New Town very well built (after the Turki&s;h manner) with a large <HI>Bazare</HI> or Market-place. Here are two Mo&s;ques, and &s;e|veral Greek Churches. The Chri&s;tians here, are thrice the Number of the Turks, and Jews. The Je&s;uites have al&s;o a &s;mall Chappel in their hou&s;e; Their care is to look after the Slaves, when the Gallys are there. Between the Ca&s;tle and the Town is their Burying place, &s;et out with many fine peeces of Marble, mo&s;t of which are brought from the ruins of <HI>Athens.</HI> The Harbour is very &s;ecure again&s;t any wind, it may be &s;aid to be a Port for above two miles, the main land be|ing &s;o near and the ground good ankor hold. It is &s;ecured from an Enemy by the Ca&s;tle, which has above twenty good Gunns planted this way. Upon the whole I&s;land, there is but one place more, which may be called a Town, which is <HI>Ca&s;tel Ro&s;&s;o,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>Ki&s;il Hi&s;ar.</HI> It was formerly called <HI>Caristus,</HI> (as the Greeks &s;till call it) &s;tanding in a deep Bay, at the SE^t. of the I&s;land. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands on a high and &s;teep hill, above a mile from the Sea, having a large plain, which &s;tretcheth towards the SW^t. But affords little be|&s;ides Mulberry trees, whereof there are &s;tore. The Town is built &s;tragling upon two Mountains Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are very mean, being made of red earth, dryed in the Sun. The Ca&s;tle is to the Ea&s;t|ward &s;tanding very advantageou&s;ly to defend it
<PB N="6" REF="6">&s;elf again&s;t an Enemy. The Bay is open to the South Winds. Ve&s;&s;els which come from <HI>Canea, Malva&s;ia, Napoli, Athens,</HI> or other parts, that way, and bound for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> do u&s;ually put in here to inquire for news of Privateers. For from the Mountains, to the North of the Ca&s;tle, in a clear day may be &s;een the high Land of <HI>Scio;</HI> and no Ve&s;&s;el can pa&s;s the Streight of <HI>Andros,</HI> but what is &s;een from hence. Small Ve&s;&s;els u&s;e to come here for &s;helter again&s;t the Privateers, but have been carryed away by them in the night; to prevent which one <HI>Ibrahim Aga,</HI> at his own charge, built a Fort of an Octagon figure with two Teer of Guns, 16 Guns in each Teer. After he had fini&s;hed it, an order came from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to have him Strangled. He had &s;ome Private E|nemy who gave the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to under&s;tand, that he had &s;ome bad thoughts, in building this Fort. His E&s;tate was all confi&s;cated; But through the interce&s;&s;ion of great freinds it was mo&s;t part recovered for the u&s;e of his Son, who lived at <HI>Ne|gro Ponte.</HI></P>
<P>To the W^t. of this Place, is a large Bay called <HI>Porto Buffolo,</HI> which is able to contain many thou&s;and &s;hips. A Greek Prie&s;t told me that <HI>Xerxes</HI> had here above 1500 &s;aile of &s;hips, and other Ve&s;&s;els of warr. Clo&s;e by the water &s;ide, to the Ea&s;tward, are a great many marble Pillars; All &s;hips that come to lade <HI>Velania</HI> (i. e. dryed Acorns)
<PB N="7" REF="6">carry &s;ome away. Two miles to the North of the Port are a great many ruins more, and &s;eve|ral foundations of walls.</P>
<P>On a Mountain more Northerly is a great wall, above three miles about, and clo&s;e by it is a Vil|lage called <HI>Cupa.</HI> The ruined place they told me was called <HI>Amatos.</HI> To the North are &s;everal good Ports, and there the Inhabitants live more &s;ecure than to the South. They reckon to be upon the whole I&s;land not above 60000 &s;oules, of which not above 10000 <HI>Turks,</HI> who mo&s;t live under the command of the Ca&s;tles at <HI>Negro Ponte,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tel Ro&s;&s;o.</HI> Here is abundance of &s;ilks made, mo&s;t of which is carryed to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> towards payment of their tribute, and <HI>Decimos.</HI> The <HI>Grand Signor</HI>'s Revenue from this great I&s;land, is about 100000 Dollars. As to the Tides motion at the Bridg, I will not trouble the Reader with the &s;everal opinions, that men have about it; only that it has been ob&s;erved by &s;everal others, as well as my &s;elf, that &s;ometimes it will pa&s;s contrary at the one &s;ide to the other, and this commonly on a Southerly wind. The next I&s;land we come to in rank to the Ea&s;t is</P>

<HEAD>ANDROS.</HEAD>
<P>This keeps its name, being called by the Turks <HI>Endros.</HI> The Inhabitants are all Greeks, having a
<PB N="8" REF="7">good large Town to the NE^t. with no other walls, but tho&s;e of their hou&s;es, which join together. At the end of the lanes are Gates, which every night are &s;hut, to keep out the Privateers. In the Mountains are &s;everal &s;mall Villages, which are built &s;o convenient as they can &s;ee an Enemy, long before he comes; &s;o they have time to hide them&s;elves, and the be&s;t of their goods, in places made by their Indu&s;try in the Rocks. Upon the whole I&s;land there are not above 3000 Inhabitants, They have a great many Mulberry trees, and &s;ome years make above 10000 pound of Silk. They agree at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for about 10000 Dollars yearly, tho it &s;tands them in above 12000: be&s;ides what the Privateers &s;teal from them. Corn and Wine are here very plentifull, but their main &s;tock is rai&s;ed from Silk, and Cat|tle. with the latter, and other provi&s;ions they &s;upply <HI>Tine.</HI> There are &s;everal good Harbours for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, but only one for &s;hips, which is to the SE^t.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="7">they landed their Army &s;everal times. In the year 1658. the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> came to a Port to the N^h. called <HI>La Colebitre,</HI> when in the night he landed 6000 men, hoping to &s;urprize them; But the vigilant I&s;landers &s;oon fled from their habitations, and betook them&s;elves to the Ca&s;tle, &s;urrounding the hill, under the great Gunns. The <HI>Proveditore</HI> di&s;patcht away a <HI>Fe|lucca</HI> to acquaint the Captain General at <HI>Argen|tiero;</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> finding they could not take the Ca&s;tle, de&s;troyed the Country, burnt the hou&s;es, and carryed away about 10 &s;laves. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands on a high rock on the top of the Mountain. It is much higher than any other part of the I&s;land, &s;o as it may be di&s;cerned at both &s;ides of the I&s;land. Upon any occa&s;ion of re|joycing, Fires were made upon the top of the Ca&s;tle, which have been &s;een at the I&s;land of <HI>Scio.</HI> The Inhabitants are mo&s;t Greeks, but the&s;e the greate&s;t part are Roman Catholicks, who have <HI>here</HI> a Bi&s;hop. His Palace is at a place cal|led <HI>Campos,</HI> to the NW^t. of the Ca&s;tle, di&s;tant from it about 3 miles. There are above thirty Villages upon this I&s;land, and above 20000 &s;ouls. Tho&s;e of the Greek Religion are to the Ea&s;tward end of the I&s;land, having many plea&s;ant Villages; though &s;eated among Rocks. <HI>Tine</HI> hath but one Port, which is &s;ecure for &s;hipping.

To the North is another called <HI>La Cullebithra.</HI> This I&s;land has ever been a great Eye-&s;ore to the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the late Warr of <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;everal Bri|gantines were mann'd out of this place; which did continually torment the <HI>Turks</HI> in all their Quarters. A famous Privateer, called <HI>Georgio Maria,</HI> was a terror to all the &s;ea-Towns about the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> He was of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> of a good Family. He came into the &s;ervice of the <HI>Venetians</HI> with a &s;mall <HI>Briganteen,</HI> called the <HI>Lepetto</HI> (or little Fox) his &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o great, that he built at <HI>Bagnio</HI> a place for &s;laves made &s;quare, to the Ea&s;t of the City on the hill, in which was an account of up|wards 4000 that he had brought out of <HI>Turky</HI> into &s;lavery, of which he gave the tenth to the Generall. From a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el he came to com|mand a &s;quadron of three &s;hips and Eleven <HI>Bri|ganteens.</HI> I will not give you an account at large of his &s;everal Victories, if I &s;hould, it would &s;well my Narrative to too great a Vo|lume. I will therefore only give you a Relation of his Death. In the year 1667 <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> had been very &s;uccesful again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> carrying a|way whole Towns at a time, &s;o as complaint was carryed from all parts to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where his name was in every &s;ea-faring-mans mouth.
<PB N="11" REF="8">The Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> had particular orders to &s;earch for him, and being at <HI>Scio,</HI> advice was brought him, that <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> with his little Armado was at the I&s;lands in the Bay of <HI>Edremitt.</HI> The Per&s;on, who brought the news, had a Gratuity order'd him; and immediatly all things were or|der'd for departure, but the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> only, and the man that brought the news did know for what place they were going. There was in Port at <HI>Scio</HI> 36 Gallys, and &s;ix &s;hips of <HI>Tripoli.</HI> The Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> &s;ent orders to the &s;hips, to be ready to &s;ayle with his Gallys. There being lit|tle wind the <HI>Gallys</HI> towed the &s;hips, till they were pa&s;t the I&s;land of <HI>Scio,</HI> and drawing neare the I&s;land <HI>Metelino,</HI> with a &s;mall gale, they &s;ayled clo&s;e by <HI>Molives.</HI> The Sentinells on the I&s;lands made fires to give notice to <HI>Georgio Maria,</HI> and &s;oon came them&s;elves with the news, that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fleet was coming towards tho&s;e I&s;lands. <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> ea&s;ily believed it, and in a little time provided him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding he was before getting ready to carine his &s;hip. With the help of his <HI>Briganteens</HI> he gets his &s;hips out to the North of the I&s;lands, ordering the <HI>Briganteens</HI> to &s;hift for them&s;elves; taking his la&s;t farewell of them. The Fight was very &s;harp above 6 hours. <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> was kill'd, and his body thrown over board, (as he had de&s;ired his friends to do) that it might not come into the hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="9">his &s;hip was taken, another was &s;unk, and the third made its e&s;cape into the Bay of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Tine.</HI> Of the Turks were killed and wound|ed above two thou&s;and, of which in the <HI>Tripoly</HI> &s;hips above 300. In the &s;hip where <HI>Georgio Ma|ria</HI> was, (of 200 men) not above 20 were taken a|live, and tho&s;e mo&s;t of them wounded. After this Victory the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> went to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> towing up the &s;hip in great Triumph at his Gallys Stern, as he pa&s;t the <HI>Serraglio</HI> point. No man &s;ince <HI>Scanderbeigh</HI> has been &s;o great a plague to the <HI>Turks.</HI> His lo&s;s was generally lamented by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but e&s;pecially by tho&s;e of this I&s;land, whom he very much inriched. He was made a Knight of S^t. <HI>Mark,</HI> for the good &s;ervice he had done the <HI>Venetians</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Tine</HI> are better to pa&s;s than any o|ther of the I&s;landers, paying only their tenths to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> They make great quantitys of Silk and Wine, but have not corn nor wood to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a month, being &s;upplyed from other I&s;lands, and parts of the Maine, clo&s;e by them. Since the peace between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> they have con&s;ented to pay to the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> a pre&s;ent of five hundred Dollars yearly, which was anciently a cu&s;tom.

I had the honour to dine with him &s;everal times, being introduced by <HI>Padre Emanuel</HI> a Je|&s;uite, and Captain <HI>Beneditto Ne&s;te</HI> a <HI>Legorne&s;s.</HI> The former I had often &s;een at the Je&s;uites Con|vent, and at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors hou&s;e at <HI>Galatta</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> He was here in great E&s;teem, being a learned <HI>Scholar,</HI> a great <HI>Travel|ler,</HI> and an Experienced <HI>Phy&s;ician;</HI> he had an eminent intere&s;t, as well in <HI>Turky,</HI> as in <HI>Chri|&s;tendom:</HI> having an Univer&s;al corre&s;pondence in mo&s;t places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> He would en|tertaine all Strangers of what Nation, or Religion &s;oever, and gave me &s;o good an account, of my own Country, as few of my own Countrymen a|broad have been able to give me the like.

<PB N="35" REF="21">anchor at the North of <HI>Millo</HI> at a place called <HI>Por|to Polumbo,</HI> about 4 miles from the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet. So &s;oon as we came to anchor, a boat came to command us to come to the General. The Ma|&s;ter was a &s;tranger to the&s;e Seas, and did not care to venture out of his &s;hip, but at la&s;t I per&s;waded him, and we went in our own Boat with two men.

About break of day the wind being fair at E^t. and a fre&s;h gale, our Ma|&s;ter was very impatient to be going, &s;eeing al&s;o a &s;hip coming from the Ea&s;tward. All the per&s;wa|&s;ions I could u&s;e would not prevaile with him; but re&s;olved he was to go, ordering his men to

I told him what might be the ill con&s;equence of breaking his promi&s;e with a General, and that he would &s;oon &s;end after us; but he depended upon the nimble|ne&s;s of his Ve&s;&s;el, and que&s;tion'd not but &s;oon to be out of their reach. All things were in readine&s;s, our anchor up, and we &s;et &s;aile. Soon did the wind abate, &amp; the Sentinells giving notice to the General that our &s;hip had loo&s;ed &s;aile, immediat|ly two Gallys were di&s;patcht after us, they came &s;oon up to us, and firing a Gun, the &s;hot pa&s;t betwixt our Ma&s;t.

Indeed I did not de&s;ire to be &s;een in the bu&s;ine&s;s, not knowing what might befall us; but go I did. They towed our boat at a Gally Stern and we &s;oon came to the Generals Gally. By the way we re&s;olved on an Excu&s;e, after rowling a great many, I propo&s;ed to the Ma&s;ter that our &s;afe&s;t way was to acquaint the General, that our de&s;ign was not to go to Sea; but that &s;eeing a &s;hip com|ing from the Ea&s;tward we did not know what &s;he might be; And we having Warr with <HI>Algier</HI> we were fearful, &s;o weiged anchor to make a trip, and get under the Generals Stern. This thought
<PB N="37" REF="22">of mine plea&s;ed the Ma&s;ter, and we concluded to an&s;wer in this note, when we &s;hould be exa|mined. When we came to the Generals Gally, we were order'd to come up; the General asked which was the Ma&s;ter; I &s;hewed him the Ma|&s;ter, he order'd him to be put in chains at the Prow of the Gally, being in a very great pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;aid that he would make an Example of him, and give an account of his ba&s;e action to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Venice.</HI> I let him breath out &s;ome of his pa&s;&s;ion, then &s;poke to the <HI>Com|pagno di Standardo,</HI> de&s;iring him to acquaint the General with the true manner of our intent, which he did.

There is a <HI>Caddee Aga,</HI> and about twenty <HI>Turks</HI> more, who live upon the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Conti|nual watch is kept, to give notice if any Priva|teers do land, and then the <HI>Caddee</HI> and other <HI>Turks</HI> hide them&s;elves up in the Mountains. But in the yeare 1676 <HI>Mon&s;ieur Crevillier</HI> landed a party of men, re&s;olving to ruine the whole I&s;land, he found out 4 of the <HI>Turks,</HI> whom he carried a|way with what el&s;e they found.

In matters of Ju&s;tice, when the <HI>Caddee</HI> is not here, the <HI>Vecchiardi</HI> (El|ders of the <HI>Greeks</HI>) do judge and determine Cau|&s;es; but mu&s;t be &s;ure to take the Rights of the <HI>Cad|dee,</HI> which are &s;ent him to <HI>Scala nova,</HI> and then he puts his &s;eal to the Award of the <HI>Vecchiardi.</HI> In every Village there is one called the <HI>Proto,</HI> or Chief, who over&s;ees and gathers in the Tenths of their Crop, giving an exact account to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and to ingratiate him&s;elf with them, he will be as &s;evere with his fellow Chri&s;tians, as the <HI>Turks</HI> can be. Notwith&s;tanding the Moun|tains, which are many here, there is land enough to be manured to imploy 10000 men, which with good management, would be in few years little inferiour to <HI>Scio.</HI> There is nothing that can be planted, but the ground doth bring forth. Vines are generally more natural to this &s;oile, than to any of the neighbouring I&s;lands, and the wines more plea&s;ant, but for want of conveni|ence to &s;ell them, they plant no more than to &s;uffice their own occa&s;ions.

Next morning being the 7^t^h the wind at S E^t 'twas a fine gale, they weighed anchor, the weather promi&s;ing them a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age, but the wind veering to the N E^t with a &s;trong gale, they wea|thered <HI>Caraborun</HI> &s;tanding for the I&s;land of <HI>Mete|lino;</HI> intending to &s;pend the night under the Lee of that I&s;land in &s;mooth water, bringing their &s;hip under a Maine-Cour&s;e. All that night the wind increa&s;ed every hour more and more, &s;o that in the morning it was a mo&s;t violent Storme, the Sea in a breach, the &s;ky very black and thick,
<PB N="61" REF="38">and the Sun lowring and red, which were the undoubted Indications of its continuance. The Spray of the Sea was &s;o forcibly carried by the wind over the &s;hip, that the Ma&s;ts, yards and Decks were querned with the white &s;alt. This extremity of weather made them think of &s;ome Port, to &s;ecure them&s;elves. The I&s;land of <HI>Ip&s;ara</HI> lying about 8 Leagues di&s;tant S by W^t from <HI>Me|telino,</HI> it was &s;uppo&s;ed by the Ma&s;ter a &s;afe place with this wind to &s;pend the fury of the Storm in; &s;o they put her before it, with fore-&s;aile down, and main-&s;aile in the brailes; but the wind &s;oon blew away their fore-&s;aile like paper, and in bringing another to the yard, it had the misfor|tune to be foule of the flook of the anchor, and &s;oon became as un&s;erviceable as the other. Be|ing thus deprived of their commanding &s;ailes, they loo&s;ed their &s;prit-&s;aile and &s;et their maine|cour&s;e.

They all began to de&s;paire of her, and with ca&s;t up eyes and &s;tretched out armes thought now of no other but their la&s;t and final Port. But in the mid&s;t of this horrid con|&s;ternation

When they were in this di&s;tre&s;s, they fired a Gun to give warning to the <HI>Smyrna</HI>-Factor, and Ketch, who thereupon &s;tood away for <HI>Milo.</HI> The &s;torme continued all that day, &s;o that with two anchors down (the &s;heat anchor being one) they had much ado to &s;ecure the &s;hip fa&s;t, the Storm continuing &s;o very violent.

The <HI>Turks</HI> call this City <HI>Stamboll,</HI> to &s;ignify, that it is abounding in all things; and indeed it is the be&s;t &s;upplyed with Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Fowl, Fruit and Corn of any great City in <HI>Europe.</HI> Many having given a large account of it already, I will forbear enlarging thereon.

<HEAD>The pre&s;ent State of that famous I&s;land and Kingdom of <HI>CANDIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> which in old time (and now by the <HI>Turks</HI>) is called <HI>Crete,</HI> hath followed the other parts of the Empire of <HI>Greece,</HI> and is now &s;ubjected to the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after a Warr for above 27 years. In which time the <HI>Venetians</HI> (tho' in comparri&s;on, as a flea in the beard of a Lyon, to the Ottoman Forces) did bravely, and with an unparallel'd Courage, defend the City of <HI>Candia</HI> to the la&s;t ex|tremity. After a clo&s;e Siege for near 2 years continuance, the Vizier there in per&s;on, and with him the be&s;t of all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, they were forced to &s;urrender, yet upon the mo&s;t honorable termes, that they them&s;elves could propo&s;e; car|rying away with them not only their Cannon, and all other amunition, but al&s;o the bells, which were in the Steeples, and whatever el&s;e they thought worth the Labour. The Vizier was &s;o over-joyed, that the City was &s;urrender'd to him, that he appointed &s;everal of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> boats, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Venetians,</HI> if they &s;hould have occa&s;ion of their help in carrying their goods to the &s;hips. He was &s;o ob&s;erving of his word in the Peace.
<PB N="70" REF="46">that he cau&s;ed two <HI>Janizarys</HI> to be put to death for attempting to force their way into the City. All <HI>Europe</HI> has heard of this great Seige, how many thou&s;and Bombs were ca&s;t into the City; How many Mines, and Fornellos were blown up; and how many bold a&s;&s;aults the <HI>Turks</HI> made. They had at la&s;t workt them&s;elves &s;o near the Walls that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the be&s;ieged to make u&s;e of any of their great Guns. For no &s;ooner could a man appear to level a Gun, but there was a &s;hower of bullets and arrows, &s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> would often attempt to under|mine the Walls, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> did counter|mine them, and when they met under ground, they fought mo&s;t de&s;perately. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have an Engine which they call <HI>trombo di fuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> it is as long as a half Pike, the Staff bigger: At the end are two Irons, about two Foot long, in the form of a fork; In which is fa&s;tned a trunk made of Iron, (and &s;ome are of wood) in it are five charges, each firing &s;everally at a certain time, and carry &s;everal bullets to do execution as far as a Pi&s;tol. They &s;et fire to it at the fore part, and have a touch, to reach from one chamber to the other. Another Invention they had to fi&s;h up the <HI>Turks,</HI> when they attempted to under|mine their Walls. They had hooks made in the forme of a boats grapling, the points &s;harp, fa&s;tn'd to a rope and 4 or 5 foot of chain at the end;
<PB N="71" REF="46">The&s;e hooks they often ca&s;t over the Walls, a|mong&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;eldom failed to bring up a <HI>Turke,</HI> &s;ome fa&s;tned by the clothes, o|thers by the body. I have heard &s;ome of the officers &s;ay, they have taken &s;everal in a night. For when the hook was fa&s;tned, they gave them not time to unhook them&s;elves but had them &s;oon over the Walls, and many a <HI>Turk</HI> have the common &s;oldiers eaten. At the <HI>Greeks</HI> leaving <HI>Candia</HI> there happned a mo&s;t &s;ad accident; a new &s;hip called <HI>La Fregatta Galliera,</HI> or the Gally Frigot, was pitcht upon for tran&s;porting mo&s;t of the Principal of the Gentry, and the greate&s;t part of the riches of the Citizens; there was al&s;o (be&s;ides what were mounted) 50 great bra&s;s Guns, the Pa&s;&s;engers were between 250 and 300 be&s;ides 200 Mariners and upward. Being between a little I&s;land called <HI>Ovo,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Cerigo,</HI> the &s;hip open'd, and not a man was &s;aved. The re&s;t of the Fleet got well, &s;ome to <HI>Zante,</HI> others to <HI>Ceffalonia, Corfu</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> landing the <HI>Greeks</HI> as they had a fancy to the place which they came to, or as they found freinds. Thus they left their E&s;tates to the Ene|my, and not above 5 or 6 <HI>Greeks</HI> remained, who being in years, and &s;ickly withal, de&s;ir'd leave of the General, that they might tarry, and end their days there. In the Articles of peace it was concluded, that the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;hould keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="72" REF="47">of three &s;mall I&s;lets which are clo&s;e to the I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> and have each a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Turks</HI> did laugh at their propo&s;als, &s;aying we have the Henn, and the Chicken will follow of cour&s;e, of the&s;e I&s;letts you &s;hall have a further account hereafter. This I&s;land had 20 Citys, and above 1000 Towns, Villages and large Mona&s;terys, now there is not above 4 Citys, and 300 Towns and Villages. To give you an account of them I will begin with the ea&s;tern part. This was formerly a Province called <HI>Sittia;</HI> the head City had the &s;ame name, &s;tanding in a Bay, at the North Ea&s;t part of the I&s;land, at the We&s;t &s;ide extending from the North, to the bot|tom of the Bay Southerly, above a mile in length. The Ca&s;tle &s;tood on a ri&s;ing ground to the N W^t. of the Town, built of a cour&s;e Marble &s;tone. The <HI>Venetians</HI> finding the place was not Tenable, cau&s;ed &s;everal mines to be made, by which they de&s;troy'd the Ca&s;tle and Town, and &s;o went to <HI>Candia.</HI> By the ruins it may be &s;een the builders had no thoughts, &s;o &s;oon to have left them; mo&s;t of the Walls are intire and &s;ome have lower rooms with beams, which are patcht up, and &s;erve for &s;tore hou&s;es to put corn in, when any &s;hip comes to lade. In the year 1680 I was here and load|ed a <HI>Sattee</HI> of <HI>Provence</HI> Captain <HI>I&s;eppe Bremon</HI> who belonged to <HI>Ca&s;&s;is</HI> about 10 miles from <HI>Mar&s;ellis.</HI> The Wheat was the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s own, which he &s;old
<PB N="73" REF="47">at 3 <HI>Timins</HI> a <HI>Killoe,</HI> (i. e. about <HI>14^d.</HI> the Bu&s;hel.) The <HI>Turk</HI> who came with me from <HI>Candia,</HI> was an ordinary Servant. But as we travelled the Road, and when we came hither he would do|mineer at a &s;trange rate. Here are no Inhabi|tants nearer then 12 miles, at a &s;mall Village cal|led <HI>Alona,</HI> &s;aving at a &s;mall hou&s;e and Chappel, which is a <HI>Metoiki</HI> (or Chappel of ea&s;e to a Mona|&s;tery up in the Mountains) about a quarter of a mile from the Sea. Among&s;t others the <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;ts brought their tenths, to the <HI>Turks.</HI> They all de&s;ire to have a Seaman to mea&s;ure their Corn rather then the <HI>Turks;</HI> for they will &s;tir the corn about with their hands, and pre&s;s it down; But the Ma&s;ter was content to take it with a ju&s;t mea&s;ure, and Favoured the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> what he could. At <HI>Alona</HI> re&s;ides the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Lieutenant, who has 100 <HI>Spahees</HI> to guard the Coa&s;t from Pri|vateers; but more to gather in the tenths. The <HI>Greeks</HI> maintaine them, at their own charge. To the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Sittia</HI> on a point of land, is a Mona&s;tery dedicated to S^t <HI>I&s;idoro</HI> to which be|longs a great Revenue, it maintains about 40 <HI>Calo|jeros.</HI> There are &s;everal rich Lamps, and other ornaments of Silver and Gold. Here they &s;hew you the Picture of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, which (they &s;ay) was brought by Angels from <HI>Stancoi,</HI> and was found in a cave of that Mountain. They have Lands on the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where they
<PB N="74" REF="48">have a <HI>Metoiki</HI> and &s;everal <HI>Calojeroes,</HI> to gather in the cropps of corne, oyl and wine; the <HI>Turks</HI> allowing them to enjoy it, calling it <HI>Vacofa,</HI> or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for Gods u&s;e, yet they will receive their tenths from it. The <HI>Gomina</HI> or Over&s;eer of this Mona&s;tery had made his E&s;cape, taking with him above two thou&s;and pieces of Eight, in ready mony and plate, but being pur&s;ued, he was taken at <HI>Scarpante</HI> an I&s;land lying in the midd way, between <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> &amp; by the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s order put to death. To the South of <HI>A|lona</HI> about 10 miles is a very high Mountain cal|led by the <HI>Turks Ba&s;ha Dogg,</HI> from it may be &s;een the Sea, to Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North and South. Here are the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle called formerly <HI>Barozza,</HI> 'twas built by a Gentleman of that name. It is, &s;quare, about 60 Foot high, with a tarrazzo, and battlements on the top, each &s;quare is a|bout 40 foot. The Wall is very thick; the door about 10 foot from the ground, having a dry ditch about it. Of the&s;e there are &s;everal about the I&s;land, as the old built Ca&s;tles are in <HI>Ireland.</HI> For formerly the <HI>Candiotes,</HI> did u&s;e to Warr a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, but now all &s;uch quarrells are ended by their &s;ubjection to a common Ma&s;ter. The City of <HI>Girapetra</HI> is to the South of the I&s;land, having no &s;ecure Port, but an open Road, where Ve&s;&s;els in the Summer time may be with &s;ecurity from the Weather, but not from Priva|teers;
<PB N="75" REF="48">for while I was there, they carryed away a Saike which came from <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Town is wall'd round, and hath a &s;mall Ca&s;tle which lyes higher then the Town. Here is continually a Garri&s;on of 200 <HI>Janizaries,</HI> be&s;ides there are &s;everal <HI>Turks,</HI> who are Merchants, &s;o that in all they can rai&s;e 500 fighting men. There is about it a very fine plain full of Olive trees and &s;ome plea&s;ant Gardens. Their hou&s;es are well built, of good &s;tone, the rooms very lofty; but few hou&s;es above two &s;torie high. In the year 1675, one <HI>Mon&s;ieur Crevellier,</HI> a famous Privateer, land|ed 500 men in the Bay of <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> travelling in the night, he came next morning, ju&s;t at the dawning of the day, and found the <HI>Turks</HI> at their <HI>Sabbah namas</HI> morning prayer, &s;o he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Town, carryed away 200 &s;laves, nail|ing up the Guns which were in the Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Turks</HI> which were at the South part of the Town, betook them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, for they had not the heart to return home, to fetch their armes. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Crevellier</HI> to retreat with this great prize, re&s;olved to kill what hor&s;es he found, &s;ecuring twenty for him&s;elf, &amp; officers, to ride at the reare; This enter prize was effected in le&s;s then &s;ix hours after they enter'd the Town, for they did not tarry to ran&s;ack the hou&s;es much. After they were departed, about 300 men, <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> were got together, and marched a
<PB N="76" REF="49">mile or two out of town, and had not <HI>Crevellier</HI> kill'd the hor&s;es, he could never have got out of the I&s;land. It is very &s;trange that &s;o many men could come with that &s;ecre&s;y as not to be di&s;co|vered, and that the hearts of tho&s;e <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould be &s;o dull'd. Immediatly they di&s;patch't expre&s;|&s;es to the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> Writing to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> that above 1500 Chri&s;tians had landed, and car|ryed away 200 Pri&s;oners, mo&s;t of them men of the Garri&s;on; the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> asked the me&s;&s;enger, if the re&s;t of the Inhabitants were a &s;leep, or dead; <HI>No &s;ays the me&s;&s;enger, but their hearts were, be|ing all &s;urprized, &s;ome in their Mo&s;ques, and &s;ome in the Coffee hou&s;es, and not a man, that had his &s;en&s;es. Mo&s;t of the hor&s;es being al&s;o kill'd.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> a&s;ked him how he e&s;caped, he an&s;|wered, <HI>that he had the wit to hide him&s;elf, as a great many others did.</HI> There were three Gal|lys in the Mole at <HI>Candia,</HI> under the command of one <HI>Babba Ha&s;&s;an,</HI> who were &s;ent out to look after <HI>Crevellier,</HI> but to no purpo&s;e, for they re|turned without &s;eeing him. Since, there is an order that the Gates &s;hall be &s;hut an hour before Sunn &s;et, and not opened till an hour after morn|ing prayers, and now there are &s;everal guards on the Mountains, be&s;ides the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Candia,</HI> has threatned, the Providitore at <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> to complain to <HI>Venice</HI> if he &s;uffer any Privateers to come into that Bay; &s;o as for &s;ome years they
<PB N="77" REF="49">have attempted nothing. The Country towards the South is not &s;o mountanous as to the North, and Northwe&s;t parts; having &s;everal large and plea&s;ant plaines, which have many ruins of fine town's. To the Ea&s;t of <HI>Girapetra</HI> about 10 miles I went to &s;ee a Cave under the Mountain of <HI>Iro</HI> as they now call it, where they &s;ay S^t <HI>Paul</HI> preached: it is a large Chappel having 12 pillars all cut out of the Rock, which was done by the Chri&s;tians in the night time. Some &s;ay it was fini&s;hed in le&s;s then a months time. Clo&s;e by is a Fountain where they &s;ay he u&s;ed to Baptize, and it is now called S^t <HI>Pauls</HI> Fountain, the water thereof is very good, to cure &s;uch as have &s;ore eyes. From <HI>Gierapetra</HI> to <HI>Bonifacia</HI> is 14 hours riding mo&s;t in plains, very delight&s;ome, there being very high Mountains to the North, with mo&s;t plea&s;ant valleys between, and abundance of <HI>Cyprus</HI> trees. <HI>Bonifacia</HI> &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, having only the Walls of a Ca&s;tle. The Inhabitants are mo&s;t <HI>Greeks,</HI> very poor; here is a Metropolitan who pretends to be next to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Candia.</HI> There are two <HI>Italian</HI> Churches; the dores are made up with Walls to keep Cattle from going in. The <HI>Greeks</HI> have four &s;mall Churches, but one will contain more then all the Inhabitants. They have now new named the place calling it <HI>Mala|facia</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Bonifaci</HI> (good Face) it being &s;o much alter'd from what it was in former time.
<PB N="78" REF="50">From <HI>Bonifacia</HI> to the <HI>Labarinth</HI> is about 10 miles, or three hours riding W^t, mo&s;t a plain. Several men have &s;everal opinions about this building, (if I may call it &s;o.) But one Signior <HI>Venetando,</HI> who was born in a neighbouring Village, gives this account, that a certain King of this I&s;land, had &s;o great a hatred for all women, that he order'd this place for his Court, and at la&s;t lived &s;o pri|vate that he would not &s;uffer any to come to him but &s;uch as ruled in his &s;tead. He would &s;el|dome come out but to wor&s;hip at a Temple de|dicated to Jupiter, which &s;tood clo&s;e by it. In this <HI>Labarinth</HI> he ended his days, and had a fa|mous Tombe built for him, the ruins of which they &s;hew you. The <HI>Labarinth</HI> is above two miles about, being &s;o covered on the top with earth, as it &s;eems to be all of firm land; we entred it with two torches, and candles in Lanthornes, having a line to direct us out again. The way is plain under foot, and archt over head, &s;ome ar|ches being about 10 foot high, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, with &s;everal windings. I made it my bu&s;i|ne&s;s to ob&s;erve if there was any thing of a build|ing, in the pillars or &s;ides, but found it mo&s;t an entire &s;tone, which they told me, &s;o cemented together that indeed it appeared &s;o. Here are a great many &s;mall places about 4 foot long, 2 broad, and 2 over, which were for burying pla|ces. There are abundance of batts, which hang
<PB N="79" REF="50">in clu&s;ters, &s;ome are larger than ordinary. We endeavoured to fright them &s;corching their wings, by which we found there was life in them; their &s;leep is ob&s;erv'd to be much more &s;ound with a N^o. wind, than with a S^o. wind, as the &s;pring comes on, they leave their palace. We had almo&s;t end|ed our line, being about 100 pikes, which is above 80 yards, and then returned out, being a good hour in the <HI>Labarinth.</HI> The damps are very great; again&s;t rain it is always dropping, but very dry with Northerly winds. At the end is a lake, and they tell you, that &s;ome have attempted to go to it, and have been drawn into it. Our cu|rio&s;ity did not invite us to &s;ee it, for were it not true, as in probability 'tis not, the noi&s;om &s;mells are enough to &s;tifle one. To the South and clo&s;e by, is a &s;mall Village with two Churches, which &s;eem to have been Temples. To the S W^t, about 10 miles di&s;tant, is that famous and great Moun|tain called <HI>P&s;illo Vuona,</HI> formerly Mount <HI>Ida;</HI> at 4 of the Clock it ca&s;ts a &s;hadow on the <HI>Labarinth,</HI> on it are many plea&s;ant Mona&s;teries with Groves of Cypre&s;s trees, and abundance of Fountains. Some &s;ay the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary</HI> may be &s;een from the top. From the <HI>Labarinth</HI> to <HI>Candia</HI> is about 10 hours riding, mo&s;t in a plain, till within 10 miles of the City. At the right hand, about a mile from the road, is a mo&s;t &s;tately Mona&s;tery, dedi|cated to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, which was built by
<PB N="80" REF="51">order of the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great. It hath always been continued to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and kept its &s;plendor, till the late Warr, when it was much defaced. There are abundance of Mona|&s;terys, but very poor, and &s;ome are &s;hut up for want of Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Candia Novo</HI> is about 6 miles from the City of <HI>Candia</HI> Southward, being a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, having <HI>Mount Jove</HI> to the We&s;t. Here the <HI>Turks</HI> kept their Trea&s;ure and Ammunition, in the Siege of <HI>Candia.</HI> It is &s;eated very plea&s;antly on a ri&s;ing ground, giving a pro&s;pect to the Sea. It is now chiefly inhabited by <HI>Greeks;</HI> the Ca&s;tle has a Garri&s;on of <HI>Turks,</HI> which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> intended to bring to <HI>Candia,</HI> and demoli&s;h the Ca&s;tle, hav|ing writ to the Port about it; but he had no an|&s;wer. <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;o famous, and generally known for the brave defence it made again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> appears by the ruins to have been one of the be&s;t built Citys in the midd-land Seas. It is &s;eated on the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, almo&s;t midd-way between <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Sittia,</HI> in a plea&s;ant Bay, hav|ing an artificial Port, &s;ecured from the N^o wind by a Mole about 200 yards long, with a &s;trong and large Ca&s;tle at the head, called <HI>Ca&s;tel del Mo|lo</HI> having 20 great Guns. From the South is a low point of land, which runs into the Sea N^o. which &s;ecures it from the Ea&s;terly wind's, and makes the entrance not above 30 yards wide;
<PB N="81" REF="51">upon this point of land the <HI>Turks</HI> have built a co|ver'd way, with a very thick wall, full of holes, for &s;mall &s;hot, &s;trongly arch't over, reaching from the Ar&s;enal to the entrance into the Port, where is a &s;mall Fort with 4 great Guns, al&s;o ve|ry &s;trongly arch't over, &s;o as no Bomb can offend it. At the right hand, at coming out of the Gate to the Mole, is a new Fort built with 4 very great Guns, which lye level with the water, over them are 8 &s;maller Guns. This Fort is oppo&s;ite to the mouth of the Port, and is arch't over to prevent danger from Bombs, or wild fire. On the Mole, are &s;everal great Guns planted with arches over them. To the Ea&s;t of the Ar&s;enal, is the old Ca&s;tle called <HI>La Battaria del Ar&s;enal,</HI> which is rebuilt, with a ditch round it, to bring in the Sea, mo&s;t cut out of a firm Rock. The Port is almo&s;t round, and &s;ecure again&s;t any wind, for Gallys and &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, but there is not wa|ter enough for &s;hips of any con&s;iderable bigne&s;s. It is fill'd very much with the rubbi&s;h, that the rains carryed into it, from the City, and would certainly have been choakt up in a few years, had it not been for a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, one <HI>Mon&s;ieur Dudei,</HI> who, to ingratiate him&s;elf with the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> cau&s;ed an Engine to be brought from <HI>Mar&s;elle</HI> to clean&s;e it. There are the ruins of 12 Arches of the Ar&s;enal, and about 6 Arches are yet en|tire, but they u&s;e them only to work in when the
<PB N="82" REF="52">Gallys are there: No Gallys having been built here. The City is not repair'd towards the land, where the Walls are &s;o much &s;haken, that it will require a great deal of time and co&s;t to fortify them. From the Port towards the We&s;t, upon the Wall are 50 large Guns planted. The Fort of S^t <HI>Andrea</HI> at the N. W^t. of the City is well re|paired, having a double wall towards the Sea. In all there are about 400 Guns planted on the Walls, and out-works, which are 6 miles in circumference. The Gates of <HI>Candia</HI> are the be&s;t I ever &s;aw, the Arch or Gate-hou&s;e being about 100 yards long, and the Gates 10 broad, the Arch is all built of firm &s;tone. It will take up three hours to walk round the out-works. There are &s;everal mines which were never blown up; Every mine had a di&s;tinct name, I was in one mine which was above a mile in length, being about 6 foot high and three broad. All the plain for above two miles without the Walls is like a new plow'd field, where you cannot walk, but mu&s;t &s;ee pieces of dead mens bones. None are permitted to walk round the works, but &s;uch as have a Licence and a <HI>Janizary</HI> with them. The <HI>Turks</HI> take a delight to give an account of the &s;trength of the place, and e&s;pecially will &s;hew you a &s;mall Cave or arch, where the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gene|ral did u&s;e to &s;leep (as they tell you) to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the Bombs. Not above one eighth
<PB N="83" REF="52">part of the hou&s;es, that formerly were, are now inhabited, very few being left entire, nor do the <HI>Turks</HI> repair any but tho&s;e where they dwell; the chief Mo&s;que is well repair'd, it was formerly a Church dedicated to S^t <HI>Mark,</HI> and &s;tands to the E^t of the great <HI>Piazza;</HI> to the South of it are part of the Walls of old <HI>Candia,</HI> clo&s;e to which are built up a row of hou&s;es, two &s;torie high for the Janizaries. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s Pallace is a little below the great Mo&s;que on the other &s;ide of the way; oppo&s;ite to it is the great Hall, formerly called <HI>La Sala di Con&s;iglio,</HI> which is a very &s;tately building of white Marble, with &s;everal works in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo;</HI> to the S E^t. of it &s;tands the Church of S^t <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> with an entire Cloy&s;ter, which is a Mo&s;que. The &s;treet from the Mole to the chief <HI>Piazza</HI> is in good repair, being broad and pav'd with an even &s;tone; the hou&s;es are al&s;o well inha|bited. But that part towards the W^t. is a heap of ruins, among&s;t which live the <HI>Jews,</HI> who have very large hou&s;es, but &s;ome of their upper rooms have no other &s;helter from the weather, but a few matts made fa&s;t upon poles. The beams of the old hou&s;es are bought up, and carryed to <HI>Ve|nice, Zante,</HI> and other places; and being made of Cyprus wood they &s;erve to make che&s;ts and cabinets, many of which have been brought to <HI>England.</HI> The number of the Inhabitants of the City is not reckoned to be above 10000 with
<PB N="84" REF="53"><HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> There is a continual Garri&s;on of 2000 Janizaries be&s;ides the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s guardes. Since the taking the place, they have granted liberty to all, who will come to inhabit there, but all their in|couragement cannot bring the <HI>Candiotes</HI> to dwell there. Formerly the Plain was full of Olive trees, with delight&s;om plea&s;ure-hou&s;es and gardens. Now nothing but ruins are to be &s;een. The City &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground from the Sea. The hou&s;es were &s;o built with tarrazzis, as mo&s;t from the tops could have a &s;ight of the Sea. From <HI>Candia</HI> to <HI>Rettimo</HI> is about 12 hours riding. The City &s;tands on a point of land very plea&s;antly, having a Port to the Ea&s;t, which is almo&s;t choakt up, &s;o as no Gally can get over the barr being laden, but <HI>Brigantines</HI> and &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els are very &s;ecure again&s;t all winds. Towards the Sea are no Walls, the Rocks there fortifying the place, &s;o as an Enemy can only come by land. This place was the fir&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of, putting all to the Sword, to give the greater terror to the re&s;t of the I&s;land. Since they po&s;&s;e&s;t it, they have built three new Forts, towards the Sea, and a wall with a dry Ditch to landward. It is now chiefly inhabited by <HI>Turks,</HI> who trade to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> con&s;iderably. The hou&s;es are here intire according to the <HI>Venetian</HI> manner of building. There are &s;ome <HI>Greeks</HI> that dwel in the City; but they have a &s;mall town a|bout
<PB N="85" REF="53">a quarter of a mile off, where are 2 Churches, where they have free exerci&s;e of their Religion. The Country hereabout is very plea&s;ant, full of Olive trees, and from the Sea &s;ide, the land ri&s;es ea&s;ily to the foot of the Mountains of <HI>Sfacia,</HI> a|bout 8 miles from the City, which from the Sea &s;eems to be all a wood, from which Mountains run &s;everal plea&s;ant &s;treames, and one very large river called Platonico, which is continually full, being &s;upplyed from above a thou&s;and Fountains, which the Mountains produce. The&s;e Moun|tains of <HI>Sfacia</HI> are abounding in all things nece&s;|&s;ary for life, and nothing can be more delight|&s;om in the Summer time. They reach near 30 miles towards the S W^t. in length, and in &s;ome places about 10 in breadth, coming down clo&s;e to the Bay of <HI>Suda.</HI> The Chee&s;e which is made here, is bought up by the <HI>Venetians</HI> and other Mer|chants, and tran&s;ported to <HI>France, Italy, Zante,</HI> &amp;c. It is the be&s;t Chee&s;e that is made in any of the Southern parts, and generally as good as our <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;es, being made as bigg. Be&s;ides which they have great &s;tore of Honey, Wax, Silk, Wool, Cordovan-Leather, and a &s;ort of goats Hair, little inferior to that of <HI>Angura</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> No Olives, Oranges, or Lemons grow here. There are above 100 Villages on the&s;e Mountains, be&s;ides &s;everal Mona&s;teries. The Inhabitants are a Warr-like People, and with&s;tood
<PB N="86" REF="54">the <HI>Turks</HI> above 20 years after <HI>Rettimo</HI> was taken, living as the <HI>Mainiotes</HI> in the <HI>Morea.</HI> There are &s;uch difficult pa&s;&s;ages to them, that an army can|not march. Now at la&s;t they are brought into obedience, and by humbling them&s;elves to the Vizier, he granted them great privileges, to in|courage them, lea&s;t they &s;hould take part with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who have the I&s;land of <HI>Suda</HI> &s;o near them. As the Vizier pa&s;t by in his way from <HI>Canea</HI> to <HI>Candia,</HI> they brought him &s;everal pre&s;ents, which the Mountains produced; which he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with, that he exempted them from going with him, and paying their at|tendance on him, only he obliged them to furni&s;h the Camp with mutton at a certain rate. Mo&s;t of his own provi&s;ion was carryed from hence. Sheep at three <HI>timins</HI> (about a &s;hilling) a piece, butter at a <HI>timine</HI> the <HI>oke</HI> (a groat for two pound 8 ounces) Chee&s;e at the &s;ame rate, and at this price they were obliged to carry it as far as the Camp before <HI>Candia,</HI> where an officer gave them an acquittance, which was abated them out of their tribute. They have a certain Drugg, called by the <HI>Venetian Oldani,</HI> much of the colour of Li|quori&s;h in balls, it is a very great conforter of the head, having a plea&s;ant &s;mell, being burnt it gives a very plea&s;ant &s;ent. Mo&s;t of this is bought up by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and &s;ent to <HI>Venice.</HI> Here is al&s;o a &s;ort of wood which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Platte
<PB N="87" REF="54">ik&s;illo,</HI> it burns like a torch &amp; gives a mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell; much of it was u&s;ed to burn at the Siege. Every night at the Viziers, and other great mens tents they had fires of this wood, the wood be|ing cut &s;mall, and put into an Iron grate at the end of a pole fa&s;tned in the ground. If a man be hot in the plain, in riding two or three hours up the hills, he &s;hall find &s;o great an alteration in the air, as is incredible. About 15 miles from <HI>Retimo</HI> is a lovely Fountain called <HI>Bognare Ba&s;he,</HI> &s;tanding &s;o between two mountains, that at 2 in the afternoon it is &s;hady, continuing &s;o all the re&s;t of the day. The water is &s;o cold as will cau&s;e a dew upon any fruit that is put into it, and be one never &s;o hot, to drink of this water it will do him no harm: In the Summer time here are always &s;ome per&s;ons of Quality, who bring their beds, and continue for &s;everal days together. The <HI>Sfacioti</HI> are a healthy, &s;trong, and &s;tout people, they pretend to be of a very Ancient Stock, &s;ome there are who derive their family from be|fore the coming of our Saviour. I &s;aw a <HI>Callojero</HI> that was 110 years of age, he was very lu&s;ty and could walk very well with a &s;taff. Part of the&s;e hills are under the Juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Retimo,</HI> and part under that of <HI>Canea.</HI> From <HI>Retimo</HI> to <HI>Canea,</HI> the Road is mo&s;t by the Sea &s;ide pa&s;&s;ing by the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> having the moun|tains of <HI>Sfacia</HI> on the left hand.
<PB N="88" REF="55"></P>
<P><HI>Canea</HI> is &s;eated in a fine plain about 3 miles from the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> and upon the Sea to the North, having a very fair harbour which may be called a double Port, the one be|ing round, the other &s;tretching away to the Ea&s;t|ward; where are two Ar&s;enals. It is &s;ecure a|gain&s;t the wor&s;t of weathers, The entrance is narrow, and not above 18 foot water. To the We&s;t of which the <HI>Turks</HI> have built a new batte|ry with 20 very large Guns, and above it to the South is a great Cittadel, in which are 40 good Guns. To the Ea&s;t of the Entrance is another great Ca&s;tle which commands the part called the <HI>Sabioniera,</HI> with the Ar&s;enal. Round about the Port is a broad key, which is always full with merchandize, and is little inferior to the Port at <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> The hou&s;es are all very well built and not much batter'd. The Walls are in very good repair, having a dry ditch about 30 yards broad, and 6 deep, from the land on the other &s;ide. The Walls are about 30 foot high; within them the earth is rai&s;ed, about 10 foot higher than the Walls, there being a walk between. There is a mount which they call the <HI>Marteningo</HI> where formerly were 10 Guns, but now it is of no u&s;e. Toward the land there are 4 Ba&s;tions. To the South is the great gate called <HI>La Porti di Retimo.</HI> To the We&s;t is a mace placed on the Wall, to &s;hew where a <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> at the taking of the place,
<PB N="89" REF="55">fir&s;t enter'd the City: before the Gate is a half moon built of earth about 20 foot high; at each end is a &s;mall Pyramid of mortar and &s;culls, which are the &s;culls of Chri&s;tians, who were &s;lain be|fore the place in the year 1666. The <HI>Venetians</HI> then attempting to regain the place under the conduct of <HI>Marquis Vila,</HI> a Savojard, 5000 men were landed at <HI>Culatte</HI> at the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> and were encamped before the City &s;everal days. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;allyed out of the City, to the W^t. &s;urprizing the Chri&s;tians, and had a ve|ry great victory, pur&s;uing them to the Fort which was built at the bottom of the Bay. In this flight there were above 1500 killed and &s;e|veral taken Pri&s;oners: among&s;t the latter was one Captain <HI>Scot,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI>-man, who had his hand upon the draw-bridg of the City; he was carryed afterwards to <HI>Smyrna</HI> in the Gally's and there redeem'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants: but when he came to <HI>Venice</HI> his arrears were paid him and he returned his ran&s;om to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which re|main'd in bank, till another like occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent it &s;elf. The City is near three miles in circumference, and is much better Inhabited than <HI>Candia,</HI> having a <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> and other officers as in <HI>Candia,</HI> only in all Councils the other hath the precedence. The Country about is very plea|&s;ant, being all a plain for above 6 miles to the South and We&s;t, planted with young Olive trees
<PB N="90" REF="56">&s;o that it &s;eems to be a Garden. It is well &s;up|ply'd, both with Fle&s;h, and Fi&s;h, of the latter there is great &s;tore, for be&s;ides the Sea, there is a Lake about 10 miles to the South, which furni&s;hes them with great variety of all &s;orts. The trade is much greater here than at <HI>Candia,</HI> it lying &s;o convenient, for the <HI>Morea, Italy,</HI> and other pla|ces. The <HI>French</HI> have a great trade for oyl, wools, wax, chee&s;e, and &s;everal other commo|dities, having a Con&s;ul, and two Merchants. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have al&s;o a Con&s;ul, but mo&s;t of their oyl is &s;hipped off from <HI>Suda,</HI> to which place it is brought from <HI>Retimo</HI> and other places there|about. All great &s;hips come to an anchor at a place called S^t <HI>Todoro,</HI> being 2 &s;mall I&s;letts about 5 miles to the We&s;t of the Port of <HI>Canea;</HI> there is very good anchorage, and a &s;mall Fort to defend them. On one I&s;land, notwith&s;tanding it &s;eems to be all &s;tone, and is very low, there are &s;everal Fountains of water. No <HI>Greeks</HI> live within the City. They have a new town built to the South, about half a mile off, where are two long &s;treets, very commodious, and here they injoy all the li|berty they de&s;ire: their Churches are open, and the Bi&s;hop hath a very plea&s;ant hou&s;e, living in good E&s;teem. Clo&s;e to this town runs a plea&s;ant River, which is &s;eldom dry, There are likewi&s;e &s;everal plea&s;ant gardens, well &s;tock't with all &s;orts of delicious fruits. The <HI>Turks</HI> have al&s;o
<PB N="91" REF="56">&s;ome gardens here, but they mu&s;t retire into the City an hour before Sun &s;et, winter and &s;ummer, or el&s;e mu&s;t remain out all night, the gates being then &s;hut, and a &s;trict watch kept about the Walls. The <HI>Turks</HI> of this place are generally ve|ry rich, and incline to trade, giving all encourage|ment to have Merchants come and re&s;ide among&s;t them. There was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchant here one M^r <HI>Trenchard,</HI> who was recommended to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul to have his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but in a lit|tle time he grew weary of the place. Here they keep their oyl in great Ve&s;&s;els called <HI>Tini,</HI> which are &s;quare and made of wood, &s;ome will hold 20 Tunns. They have a &s;pecial regard to pre&s;erve the e&s;teem of their oyl, nor will they force a merchant to take any longer than it comes clear, not mixing the bottoms, as in &s;ome parts they will, by taking a hollow cane, and putting it to the bottom, by blowing through which they rai&s;e the foot of the oyl, &s;o that thick and thin goes together. Here they &s;ell the Foot of the oyl at an under price; and this &s;erves to make &s;ope. Mo&s;t parts of <HI>Turky</HI> have an E&s;teem for <HI>Canea</HI> oyl above others. Some will have it to be the better for that the trees are all &s;o young; others impute it to their care in the making, for here they gather all their Olives, whereas in the <HI>Morea</HI> they thra&s;h them down with poles. The wines are generally E&s;teem'd above all others. The red mu&s;cadine
<PB N="92" REF="57">they call here <HI>Leattico,</HI> 'tis a richer wine than <HI>Tent</HI> at <HI>Cadize,</HI> and much more plea&s;ant. I have &s;een it &s;old at 15 gallons for half a dollar. White mu&s;cadine is not &s;o good as that at <HI>Luxu|ria</HI> in <HI>Ceffalonia.</HI> Some are of opinion that in the Warr the true Mu&s;cadine grape was lo&s;t; on the Mountains there are &s;maller &s;orts of Wine, &s;o as a man may have what &s;ort he plea&s;es. All &s;orts of Provi&s;ion are very plentiful, but in the Summer time the mutton hath generally a bad ta&s;t, which proceeds from their feeding on &s;ome hearb on the Mountains. Here are Fowl of all &s;orts in a|bundance; but e&s;pecially a bird called <HI>Beccha Figge,</HI> which is almo&s;t a lump of Fat: they are valued about 4 for an a&s;per, (or 8 for a penny) Turtle-doves and Quailes are very plentifull. Their Beef is &s;mall, but very &s;weet. Of Fruits there is no &s;ort, but what they have. I never &s;aw larger pears than are brought from the Moun|tains, being a &s;ort of Sugar pear. Their mu&s;k|melons are very good, but their water-melons are &s;ingular. Salating there is all the year of all &s;orts: no place is e&s;teem'd to have larger and bet|ter Endive and Carduus, than there are here. I have &s;een Sugar canes of a great height, full as good as what are brought from <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> There are abundance of Simples which are bought here for <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Some &s;ay the rea&s;on why no Venemous thing will live on this I&s;land, is
<PB N="93" REF="57">the quantity of <HI>Dittamo</HI> that grows here. O|thers &s;ay it has only been &s;ince S^t <HI>Paul</HI> &s;et foot upon the I&s;land. Mo&s;t of the <HI>Candiotes</HI> pretend to have great knowledg in Simples. The women are experienced Doctore&s;&s;es. One I have rea&s;on to &s;ay was very &s;kilful, &s;he having in a little time wrought a great cure upon me; For by accident a Bullet having pa&s;t through my Legg, I applyed my &s;elf to her, and in 15 days &s;he cured it. She did not allow me to eat any fle&s;h, till it was per|fectly well. They have &s;everal antidotes again&s;t the Plague, but they had not the effect they pre|tended, for &s;everal of the Doctore&s;&s;es were &s;wept away by that di&s;ea&s;e, but mo&s;t certain it is that af|ter S^t <HI>John Bapti&s;ts</HI> day, it did here abate, as they always ob&s;erve it in mo&s;t of the&s;e Ea&s;tern parts. There are &s;everal other places that have had the name of Citys, which are now heaps of ruins; many hundred &s;tately Pallaces there were that now have only &s;ome Walls, and tho&s;e mo&s;t fallen down. The <HI>Candiots</HI> keep their Habit, that is the women, but the men are mo&s;t <HI>alla Turche&s;|ca,</HI> e&s;pecially the better &s;ort. They are as Ig|norant of the Antiquity of their Country, as the <HI>Moreotes,</HI> that have been above 200 years in &s;la|very. There is no Latin Church upon the whole I&s;land (as I was informed) but what is &s;hut up, or converted to the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e. Before the <HI>Turks</HI> conquered this I&s;land, there were above a million

To the S W^t. lyes a long Rock about 10 foot above water, and not above 20 from the I&s;land; again&s;t it is the Entrance up to the Ca&s;tle very &s;teep and winding; having two Gates, and a &s;trong counter&s;carp before you pa&s;s into the main Ca&s;tle. The Wall about the I&s;land is low but very thick. To the W^t. is a Mount called <HI>il Marteningo,</HI> about 30 Foot high, and 300 in circumference very &s;trongly built with &s;mall &s;tone and mortar, which has above 1000 &s;hot in it. They are &s;o fa&s;t in, that it would indanger its falling, if they &s;hould be pull'd out. The Ca&s;tle is quite round the I&s;lett, wherein and upon the <HI>Marteningo</HI> are about 120 Guns planted. The <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;everal times attempted to take this place, and to that purpo&s;e in the year 1659 they built 6 Ca&s;tles, three on
<PB N="96" REF="59">each &s;ide of the Bay, from whence they conti|nued to batter it, and &s;ecured the Harbour &s;o, as no Ship or Gally could come to bring them &s;uccor, but what in the night &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els would adventure to get in. In the year 1665 the Ca|ptain <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> attempted to a&s;&s;ault it; he came with 45 Gally's, but dur&s;t not adventure to land any men. He cau&s;ed the Gallys to batter that part which is to Sea-ward, while on the other &s;ide they continually fired from the 6 Forts. The <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Fleet was &s;o di&s;per&s;ed that they could not come to relieve them. The be&s;ieged were much &s;treightned for provi&s;ion, but mo&s;t for want of wa|ter, for above a month they had but a pint a day, and were &s;o di&s;heartned that they near inclined to &s;urrender the place. But it plea&s;ed God to &s;hew them his goodne&s;s in a &s;ignal manner, by a &s;hot from the Enemy, which did cleave a rock in &s;under at the bottom a little above the Sea, out of which &s;prang a water which &s;ufficed them to drink. I have &s;een the Fountain, and drank of the water, tho it is not very plea&s;ant. Several Of|ficers that were in the I&s;land, when it was Be&s;ieg|ed avouched this for a truth; It being noted in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Hi&s;tory of <HI>Suda.</HI> The winds com|ing about Northerly the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet came from <HI>Zante,</HI> forcing the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gallys to retreat.

<HEAD>A Relation of a <HI>Storm</HI> and great <HI>Deli|verance</HI> at <HI>Sea,</HI> in a Voyage from <HI>NEW ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1683, I embarqued aboard the Ro&s;e Friggot (Captain <HI>William Phipps</HI> Com|mander) with my Brother M^r <HI>Edward Randolph</HI> who was &s;ent to <HI>New-England</HI> with the <HI>Quo War|ranto</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Colony</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;athu&s;etts</HI> Bay. About the 12 of <HI>September</HI> we departed from the <HI>Downs,</HI> and in 5 weeks arrived in the Port of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which is the Principal Town of all <HI>New-England.</HI> Upon our arrival a Court was called to con&s;ult how they &s;hould proceed, and it was carryed in the general, that they &s;hould defend their Charter at <HI>Law,</HI> and re&s;olved they were to defend it; which was all the an&s;wer that my Brother could get from them. So he re&s;olv'd to Embarque upon the fir&s;t &s;hip bound for <HI>England,</HI> which was a &s;mall Pink called the Adventure, <HI>John Bal&s;ton</HI> Ma&s;ter, belonging to <HI>New-England.</HI> The 12 of <HI>December</HI> we imbarqued; &s;everal other Pa&s;|&s;engers were with us, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Mark Talbot</HI> Son of the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> (who came by land from <HI>New York</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) M^r <HI>William Whar|ton,</HI> M^r <HI>Robert John&s;on,</HI> and 4 or 5 men more with three women, one being with child near her time, having with her two &s;mall Children. About
<PB N="99" REF="60">9 of the Clock in the morning we weighed anchor, and with a fre&s;h N W^t. wind got clear of the land by Sun &s;et. The wind continued favorable &s;everal days, and gave us hopes of a pro&s;perous and quick pa&s;&s;age. When we were got to the height of the We&s;tern I&s;lands, our Ma&s;ter order'd a New main Sail to be brought to yard, which proved too wide by two cloaths; (or breadths of Canvas) &s;o it was again taken down, and fir&s;t fair day it was fitted, and brought to the yard. The winds were veerable for &s;everal days, and the near|er we came to the Channel, we found a great head Sea, (i. e. a Sea coming again&s;t us) which made us fear we &s;hould find Ea&s;terly winds. A|bout the 20^t^h of <HI>January,</HI> we judged our &s;elves to be about 100 Leagues to the We&s;tward of the lands-end. The wind came up at Ea&s;t, and con|tinued for two days very &s;tormy, &s;o as we could not carry any &s;ail abroad but were drove to and fro', at the mercy of the &s;ea, who&s;e waves were grown to that height, that we feared we &s;hould have been &s;wallowed up in them. The 23^d the wind abated, we &s;aw a &s;hip which was to Lee|ward of us, and made &s;igns to &s;peak to us, &s;o we boare up, and coming to Lee-ward of them, found it was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip called the Pre&s;ident, which came from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and had been beating (i. e. &s;triving again&s;t the wind) above 6 weeks in the Channel. We came &s;o near as we dur&s;t ven|ture,
<PB N="100" REF="61">when they begged of us for Gods &s;ake to &s;pare them &s;ome provi&s;ion for they were ready to peri&s;h: And notwith&s;tanding the &s;eas run &s;o high yet did they adventure to hoi&s;e out their Pin|nace with which 8 men came aboard our &s;hip, re|pre&s;enting to us the mi&s;erable condition which they were in, being 80 per&s;ons aboard, who for a months time had lived on a pound of bread for a week, and a pint of water a day each man; mo&s;t humbly did they begg that we would &s;pare them &s;ome provi&s;ion, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity peri&s;h. So our Ma&s;ter gave them about 100 <HI>l</HI> of bread, a Barrel of Bear, and promi&s;ed them, that he would not go from them, but if the weather were moderate he would &s;upply them next day with what he could well &s;pare. All that night the wind encrea&s;ed, as next morning both the Pre&s;ident and we were forced to hand all our &s;ails and hull (lye with our head to the wind without any &s;aile.) The 25^t^h we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Pre&s;ident, and the &s;torme increa&s;ed &s;till more and more. The 26^t^h about 4 of the clock in the afternoon, a &s;ea broak upon our &s;hip, which carryed away the wa&s;ts of the &s;hip (i. e. that part of the &s;ides above the up|per deck) even with the upper deck, from the quar|ter deck to the fore Ca&s;tle; the Boate, Cap&s;tern, Winde&s;s and Sheat-anchor were wa&s;ht away, my Che&s;t was fa&s;t at the one &s;ide of the Cabin door, &amp; M^r <HI>Robert John&s;ons</HI> at the other, were both wa&s;ht
<PB N="101" REF="61">away. The Ma&s;ter immediatly ordered the mi|zane-ma&s;t to be cut down, the better to keep the &s;hip before the wind; the &s;ea had a free pa&s;|&s;age into the hold between the Timber heads (i. e. topps of the ribbs of the &s;hip,) to &s;top which we imployed our blankets and ruggs, con|tinuing to pump, with both pumps, and all little enough to keep our &s;hip above water; none in the &s;hip but were wet, and wa&s;hed &s;everal times by the &s;ea. Never was a longer night &s;een to any of us, and the whole night we were imploy|ed to keep the pumps going, fearing all our en|deavours would prove vain. About 4 in the morning one of our Pumps did &s;uck, which was the mo&s;t comfortable news we could then expect, but yet we were not free from fears lea&s;t the Seas &s;hould wa&s;h away tho&s;e ruggs which we had &s;top|ed in between the timbers. Sleep was quite ba|ni&s;h't from our eyes all that night, and when the morning appeared (which was welcomed with our great thanks to Almighty God for the &s;ight of another day) we endeavoured to make a &s;tronger re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the &s;eas, finding that the continual working of the &s;ea had almo&s;t wa&s;ht away our ruggs, and what means to u&s;e, our confu&s;ed thoughts knew not. But God put into our Ma&s;ters mind the two peices of Canvas which our main-&s;aile was over charged with, which he order'd to be brought up, and when we had well
<PB N="102" REF="62">forc't in the blankets and ruggs, then we &s;pread the Canvas over it, nailing it down with pieces of hoops at each &s;ide; all the time the &s;ea wa&s;hed the men who were made fa&s;t with ropes, and by this means (Ble&s;&s;ed be God) we kept our &s;hip free with one Pump continually going. The fury of this &s;torm continued three days, and three nights driving us above 200 leagues back again. <HI>Janu|ary</HI> the 30^t^h. the wind abated and veer'd about to the North-We&s;t, but the &s;ea continued high from the Ea&s;tward, &s;o as we were fain to keep an ea&s;y &s;aile, not to force the &s;hip into a head &s;ea. <HI>February</HI> 3^d the wind increa&s;ed at W N W^t. all night. We having only our two Cour&s;es abroad. Towards break of day, we handed our main|cour&s;e, but before it was well &s;ecured the &s;torm came &s;o violently upon us, that the Ma&s;ter order'd the fore-yard likewi&s;e to be lower'd, but all their &s;trength could not get it down, nor was there any of the men that had a knife (having only their drawers without pockets) to cut the &s;aile (which they would have done) &s;o as it forc't the head of the &s;hip into the &s;ea, and &s;topt her way as a great &s;ea poop't us (that is it broke over our Stern) and fill'd us, as we all expected immediat|ly to go down to the bottom, nothing but the Ma&s;ts and fore-Ca&s;tle were above water, the Ma&s;ter &s;tood by the remaining part of the Mizan-ma&s;t, fa&s;tned to it with a rope, nothing
<PB N="103" REF="62">but his head was above water; and for a &s;mall time the &s;hip remained without any motion, but God of his infinite goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed again to draw us from the Deep. Our &s;hip with another Sea was lifted up, and our fore-&s;aile was got down and &s;towed. We were forced to bore holes between decks to let the water into Hold, and could not Pump out in &s;ix hours time the water we received with that &s;ea. We continued with|out &s;aile all that day, and the wind continu'd fair. The 8^t^h. the wind abated, and the &s;eas were more moderate; &s;o we hoi&s;ed our Main-&s;aile, with which and our fore-&s;aile, (both reeft) we &s;tood in for the Channel, about noon we &s;aw a &s;aile having but one ma&s;t, judged it to be a Ketch, but drawing nearer found it was a &s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s, having lo&s;t her main and mizane ma&s;ts, &s;everal Guns were fierd to give us notice of their great ne|ce&s;&s;ity, &s;o we loo&s;ed the reef (holes made to le&s;|&s;en the &s;aile in &s;tormy weather) of our main-&s;aile, &s;teering directly towards them. About three of the clock in the afternoon we came up with the &s;hip, and coming under their Stern, the Ma&s;ter with the re&s;t of the men got up, upon the quarter deck, upon their knees, with &s;tretched-out arms, bare heads and a dolefull voice, cryed out to us to &s;ave them for the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> &s;ake, for that their &s;hip had &s;ix foot water in Hold, and could not be longer kept above water. What heart
<PB N="104" REF="63">but mu&s;t relent at &s;uch lamentable cryes, &amp; who could pa&s;s by, without doing them all po&s;&s;ible. good! We promi&s;ed them to take them all in, de|&s;ireing them to bring what provi&s;&s;ion they could well &s;ave. They had but one Boat which was but &s;mall, and could not bring them all together, &s;o they re&s;olved to come away as many as could, and tho&s;e who remained aboard, were to get provi&s;ion ready to bring with them. The men promi&s;&s;ing the Captain to return with the boat and fetch their Companions, which without their promi&s;e he would not have come out of the &s;hip, and without him they que&s;tion'd if they &s;hould be received by us. The Ma&s;ter with 12 more (be|ing as many as could be in the Boat) came off, the &s;eas run &s;o very high, as we thought it im|po&s;&s;ible the Boat could ever get aboard us, 4 men rowed and the re&s;t with hats and caps, hoave the water out of the boat, &amp; &s;o &s;oon as they came to our &s;hip &s;ide, every one greedy to get in, let the boat knock again&s;t our &s;hip &s;ide, &s;o as her leaks increa&s;ed, and &s;oon filled with water that none of the men would adventure to return for their companions, but &s;uffer'd the boat to go a drift, which &s;o much greived the Ma&s;ter and us all as was unexpre&s;&s;ible, he having nothing but a cap on his head made of a Napkin, not &s;o much as his Journal or any other book, ordering the Boat&s;wain to bring them with him. But there was
<PB N="105" REF="63">no recovering the boat, and night coming on, we came &s;o near as we could to the &s;hip, calling to the men to make a raft with boards, and keep a broad a light, &s;o as next morning we might en|deavour to get them aboard; but &s;o &s;oon as they perceived the boat was gone, and no hopes of keeping the &s;hip above water, they gave us a &s;ad cry, which pierced the very hearts of us all; but all our endeavours could not availe to help them. We lay by them to wind-ward, they putting a broad a light, but in 3 hours after their Compa|nions had gotten aboard our &s;hip, (being about eight at night) their &s;hip &s;unk, in which 5 men were lo&s;t. The &s;hip was called the <HI>Green Friggat</HI> Captain <HI>John Sugars</HI> Commander, who came from <HI>Virginia,</HI> wanting 7 weeks, and from that Coa&s;t &s;aw no other Ve&s;&s;el but ours. They had ve|ry bad weather all the way, lo&s;t their main-ma&s;t and mizan-ma&s;t, in the &s;ame &s;torm in which we lo&s;t the Wa&s;ts of our &s;hip; they had ca&s;t over board a great part of their goods, that were &s;tow|ed between decks, two Pumps were continually imployed, and the water &s;o increa&s;ed upon them, that they de&s;paired of all hopes. One of the men being on the &s;tump of the main-ma&s;t to fa&s;ten a rope to get out more goods, he &s;aw our &s;hip, which &s;o rejoyced them, that immediatly they put out their Colours firing &s;everal Guns to give us notice of their condition. The Commander
<PB N="106" REF="64">had all his E&s;tate in the &s;hip, nothing was In&s;ured, and he &s;aved nothing but his life. Now we were to con&s;ider how we &s;hould maintain &s;uch an ad|dition of mouths, without any &s;upply of provi|&s;ion. But God Almighty the only Pre&s;erver of all things, did provide for us. We had about a quarter of a pound of bread a day, meat twice a week, and a point of water a day for a man. The Sea-men were allowed &s;omething more then the Pa&s;&s;engers by rea&s;on of their continual labour. And as our Provi&s;ion was &s;hort, &s;o was our Ap|petites abated. The Sea-men whom we &s;aved, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Pumps ea&s;ing us Pa&s;&s;engers &s;ome|what. We reckoned our &s;elves about 80 Leagues from the lands end, when we took up Captain <HI>Sugars</HI> and his men. The 10^t^h. of <HI>February</HI> we Sounded and found about 60 fathom water, and having the wind at S^o. we &s;tood in for the Chan|nel, at night we Sounded again, and found we were &s;hot within <HI>Silly</HI> at the Entrance of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Channel. At day break we &s;aw the land on our Starboard-&s;ide, which confirmed to us where we were; The wind increa&s;ed &s;o as we could not maintain any other &s;aile abroad but our Cour&s;es, with which we &s;tood off from the &s;hoar. About noon the wind veered to the W^t. blowing &s;o hard that we were forced to hand our Cour&s;es (low &s;ailes) and drive with the Sea, every &s;ea wa&s;h|ing over us. It plea&s;ed God about midd-night
<PB N="107" REF="64">the wind came to the N W^t. &s;o as we lay our head towards <HI>Silly,</HI> and next morning found the I&s;land on our Lee, &s;o made &s;aile with our fore-&s;aile, and pa&s;t between <HI>Silly,</HI> and the main, and after all our great daingers (Ble&s;&s;ed be God) the 13^t^h. of <HI>February</HI> we got &s;afe into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, and immediatly all the Pa&s;&s;engers got ashoar where (upon our bended knees) we acknowledged the great deliverance which we received. Here we had the news that the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> we mentioned, which we met and relieved at &s;ea, was forc't a|shoar (in the Storm we were in the 10^t^h.) in <HI>Mounts-Bay,</HI> and of 80 per&s;ons only 2 &s;av'd, they were &s;o weak for want of provi&s;ion as they could not hand their Saile. The woman with Child hired a hor&s;e with a paire of panniers, in each she put a Child, her &s;elf riding between them, and got &s;afe to <HI>London,</HI> where in le&s;s then a Week she was delivered of a Boy. What is remarkable more, is, to con&s;ider the great cold which was this year over all the&s;e Seas, and the many Shipwrecks which happened. The &s;ea had a continual pa&s;|&s;age over us, &s;o as our Deck was covered with a green. Many a time and hour, have I &s;tood pump|ing, with nothing but a Coat, over my Shirt, and a pair of drawers, that the Seas have washed me to the Wa&s;t, &s;o was it with the re&s;t of the Pa&s;|&s;engers, who were able to pump, and not one who was troubled with cough or cold, notwith|&s;taning
<PB N="108" REF="65">we were &s;everal times wet in the places, where we &s;lept: Oh what tongue can expre&s;s the loving kindne&s;s, and the tender Mercys of our Good God to the Children of men: Therefore to him alone, from whom alone cometh all our help and comfort, be a&s;cribed all Honour and Glory World without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
