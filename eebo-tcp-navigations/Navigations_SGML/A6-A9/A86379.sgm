<HEAD>A LETTER From the I&s;le of WIGHT Concerning the ARMY.</HEAD>
<P>MUnday Nov. 27. comes a letter to the Parlia|ment from Col. Hamond (Governour of the I&s;le of Wight) and in it another inclo&s;ed from the Lord Gen. commanding him to come to the head quarters; as al&s;o an intimation that &s;ome Orders were given to Col. Ewers, to be Goxernour of Carisbrook ca|&s;tle, and for &s;ecuring the per&s;on of the King. After the Parl. had debated this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, they voted that Col. Hamond &s;hould &s;till continue Governour of the I&s;le of Wight; and ordered that a letter from the Hou&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="3">&s;hould be &s;ent to the Lo: Generall to acquaint him with the&s;e Votes, and to de&s;ire him to countermand his Letter, for calling Col. Hamond to attend at the Head-quarters, in regard they thought him fit to con|tinue his command in the I&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>Col. Hamond conceives him&s;elf to ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> immediate obedience to the Lo: Gen. orders, for that the Parlia|ment had made him commander in chief of all the for|ces, &amp;c. and his power was derived by Commi&s;&s;ion by his Excellency, and thereupon leaves the command of that I&s;land to Col. Ewers, and the rather for that Col. Hamond was informed that Col. Ewers had pow|er in ca&s;e of refu&s;all to force the command of that I|&s;land, which might upon the offer of the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance occa&s;ion a very great trouble and di&s;turbance in the Kingdom, but whether Col. Ewers, or Major Rolfe hath the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tody of the per&s;on of the King, was not yet known.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners are comming away and it is &s;aid that on Munday la&s;t which was the la&s;t day of the Treaty, his Maje&s;ty was at liberty, and the Commi&s;&s;i|oners &s;olemnly ki&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ties hand, and took their leaves.</P>
<P>The 28 of November went from London to the head|quarters at Win&s;or, divers of the City agents and pro|pound that the Generall engagement of the people might be ha&s;tned in &s;aying the remon&s;trance lately pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e give not &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction de&s;iring no time might be lo&s;t in the going on in that great work, which was taken into con&s;ideration by the Gen. Councell.</P>
<P>Major Cromwell which brought Col. Hamonds
<PB N="3" REF="3">letter before &s;poken of, and was imployed to carry un|to him the Votes of the Hou&s;e for Col. Hamond to continue his command in the I&s;le of Wight, returned by Wind&s;or thinking that the &s;aid Col. might be come thither by that time, and having not the Lord Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;e he was one night deteined at Wind&s;o, and this day taking his journey towards the I&s;le of Wight, he met about Faraham Col. Hamond, comming towards the Head-quarters and with him Col. Ewers, and divers other Officers then Major Cromwell delivered the let|ters and votes of both Hou&s;er of Parliament for Col. Hamonds &s;tay in the I&s;le of Wight, to which he &s;aid he would give obedience and ha&s;tned to return back again to his former charge but &s;ome of tho&s;e with him.</P>
<P>The 30. of Nov. the Generall Councell of the Army pa&s;&s;ed a Declaration, &s;hewing that they had made their applications to the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons for a|voiding of dangers, and &s;etling the kingdom in peace &amp; righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, with equall con&s;titutions of Parl. to bee ratified by an Agreement and Sub&s;cription of the peo|ple; but they find their Remon&s;trance wholly rejected, and the con&s;ideration put off till there &s;hould bee no place at all left for it: yet do they not pre&s;ume that the things propounded by them, mu&s;t be con&s;idered, &s;ave for the Rea&s;on, Ju&s;tice, and publike concernment there|of.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing the prevailing part of the Hou&s;e wilfully &s;hut their eyes, and &s;top their ears again&s;t any thing of Light or Rea&s;on, they find no place left for any chari|table hopes concerning their errour in &s;uch evil wayes. Neverthele&s;&s;e, the Army a&s;&s;ume not a &s;tanding power acknowledging that lyes mo&s;t properly in tho&s;e whom the people doth chu&s;e, and tru&s;t to judge for them.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P> But con&s;idering that &s;uch power where it is, is com|mitted but in tru&s;t, and that neither this, nor any other people, did ever give up their naturall capacities of common Sence or Rea&s;on, as to the ends and Innda|mentals of that tru&s;t, and that as to the breach of &s;uch tru&s;t, there is no higher formal power of man in being to appeal unto for judgment, &s;o as we cannot but ex|erci&s;e that common Judgment which in our naturall capacity is left to us. And though in &s;maller failers of &s;uch tru&s;t, which might be born without hazard of de|&s;truction to that Intere&s;t and tho&s;e people, for which e&s;pecially the tru&s;t is, or where the Tru&s;tees were of an indifferent equall con&s;titution, in reference to the whole, or where we had an orderly and open way left for a ju&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of another formall and proper Judicature to be apealed unto in due time; we &s;hould not oppo&s;e or hold forth our private judgments to the lea&s;t di&s;turbance of that orderly and peaceable cour&s;e of judgment &s;o e&s;tabli&s;ht; yet we are &s;o fully convin|ced of the de&s;tructivene&s;&s;e of tho&s;e evils we have de|clared again&s;t, as that we dare with confidence apeale to the common judgments of indifferent and uncor|rupted men.</P>
