<HEAD>The Victory over the Fleet of the States General, obtained by His Maje&s;ties Navy Royal in the late Engagement, begun the <HI>25 July</HI> in&s;tant.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_S&V;nday</HI> 22. In&s;tant, not with|out difficulty, we got the Fleet through the <HI>Narrow;</HI> about Six in the Evening we came to an Anchor &s;hort of the <HI>Buoy</HI> in the <HI>Gunfleet,</HI> within Six Leagues of the Enemy, who came to an Anchor off of the <HI>Sledway.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 23. Both Fleets weighed, and plyed to and again with little Wind, and that Night proved very Tempe&s;tuous.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> 24. It blew hard, and we were forced to keep to an Anchor till about Two in the Afternoon, and then &s;tood off to the Ea&s;tward, and Anchored about Eight Leagues from the <HI>Ne&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 25. By Two in the morn|ing we weighed Anchor, and by Day|light we had the Enemy under our Lee: Sir <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> led the Van to the Ea&s;t|ward, with our Larboard Tacks aboard, the Wind North-Ea&s;t; and as &s;oon as he came to the head of the Enemies Fleet, which was at Ten of the Clock, we gave the Signal to bear in in a Line, our &s;elves with the Red Squadron in the middle, and Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith</HI> with the Blew, bringing up the Rear. We plyed them &s;o clo&s;e, that they could not Tack upon us; and &s;o we continued fighting till about Four in the Afternoon, and then <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with the main Body of his Fleet gave ground, whom we pur&s;ued with the Red and White Squadrons, leaving Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith</HI> with the Blew Squadron, engaged with <HI>Van Tromp</HI> and a Squadron of their Fleet. All Night we followed the Enemy, and again next Morning as &s;oon as it was light we began the Chace, and were in great hopes of taking <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> but the Wind being little, he &s;poomed away be|fore it, &s;o that our &s;maller Fregats could hardly get up with him. And by Ten a
<PB N="5" REF="3">Clock <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, we had pur&s;u|ed them as far as the <HI>Durlow,</HI> which was about Eighteen Leagues, and there he lay till about Two in the Afternoon; which time we were &s;o near the Banks of Sand, that we could not make the Chace any farther, and <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and tho&s;e with him, had opportunity to run into that place.</P>
<P>In this Chace we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed us of Two of the Enemies Great Ships, the one a Vice-Admiral of 60 Guns, 24 of them Bra&s;s, and 290 Men, commanded by <HI>Adrian Bankaert;</HI> The other the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of <HI>Haer|lem,</HI> of 66 Guns, 320 Men, Command|ed by <HI>Ruart Hellibrant;</HI> both which we &s;et on fire, not being willing to &s;pare any Men to bring them off, after we had ta|ken all their Men out of them. As &s;oon as we gave off pur&s;uit of the Enemy, we called a Council of Flag-Officers, and whil&s;t they were with us, we di&s;covered &s;ome Sails N. W. of us, and heard a &s;hooting, which we judged to be Sir <HI>Je|remiah Smith</HI> fighting <HI>Van Trump</HI> and his Squadron: Whereupon we de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ermined to draw off the Fleet, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">deavour
<PB N="6" REF="4">to intercept them before they got into their Harbours.</P>
<P>Upon the Appearance of the&s;e Fleets, we found the Wind at N.E. they &s;tand|ing right in, and we right out, as clo&s;e as we could lye, and &s;tood up till we could &s;ee their Squadron, and Sir <HI>Jeremiah Smith</HI> cha&s;ing of them: After we came fair up with them, we Tacked, and &s;tood in the &s;ame way that they did; and about Twelve a Clock at night, came to an Anchor, taking part of the Leeward Tide, to draw them upon us; which fell out within a League, as we expected it: But by the morning we perceived Sir <HI>Jeremiah Smith</HI> had lo&s;t <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the Night, and was now out of &s;ight; &s;o as the Wind having varied to the Ene|mies Advantage, they &s;tood into the Land of the I&s;land of <HI>Schawen,</HI> towards the <HI>Baniarts,</HI> and we &s;tood in after them with the <HI>Royal Charles,</HI> to &s;ix Fathom Water, where now we are expecting what the Enemy will do.</P>
