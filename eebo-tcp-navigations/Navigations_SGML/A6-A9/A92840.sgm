<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t worthy and beloved friend:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe la&s;t Letter which I &s;ent to you, contained a Com|plaint again&s;t the wicked, <HI>envious,</HI> and &s;ubtle practi|ces of Popi&s;h and prophane malignants here, all which a&s;&s;aulting of us from the beginning of this Parliament, unto this very houre, one after another, have yet notwith&s;tanding hitherto, through Gods &s;peciall ble&s;sing, beene made fru&s;trate; from which how deep a foundation of confidence is laid up in the hearts of all pious men, that God is among&s;t us, you may as readily conceive as I can ex|pre&s;&s;e. When did God (who neither wants wi&s;dome to re&s;olve, nor po|wer to execute) cea&s;e from fini&s;hing his worke unto which he did at any time apply his hand? We haply may for a longer time be exerci&s;ed, and by rea&s;on of the open armes and hidden contrivances, of Gods and our enemies, be put to the combat in this Land; however we may yet comfort our &s;elves, <HI>as you &s;ometimes did</HI> with your Zelandi&s;h Lion <HI>(Lu|ctor &amp; emergo)</HI> i. e With &s;truggling out of the deeps. For, <HI>Si Deus nobi&s;|cum, quis contra nos?</HI> i. e. If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us? The&s;e were the Mottoes of your Comfort in the times of your anxious grie|vances, under the bloody per&s;ecution of the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> and from your happy &s;ucce&s;&s;e out of your pre&s;&s;ures, and the daily experience of Gods miraculous and mercifull ble&s;sing toward us, we are taught to cor|roborate our hearts, in the mid&s;t of all our adver&s;ities, with the &s;ame comfortable meditations It may well be controverted and called into que&s;tion, which of the two be mo&s;t predominant, whether the &s;orrow which we have from the ob&s;tacles and impediments which we doe unce&s;&s;antly meet withall in the &s;o much longed for, and daily laboured for work of Reformation both of Church and State: or el&s;e the joy and comfort which we receive from the ob&s;ervation, that he which dwels in the Heavens doth laugh upon all the de&s;ignes of our enemies, and doth as it were out of the clouds every foot reveale unto us their treacherous Plots. But this is that which doth cordially grieve, and as it were pierce all hone&s;t &s;oules among&s;t us to the very heart: that you our neighbours, who have beene &s;o remarkably in former times
<PB N="2" REF="3"> advanced by us to that liberty both &s;pirituall and temporall, wherein you doe yet &s;tand in &s;pite of all your enemies, onely by Gods almighty arme, I &s;ay, this troubles us exceedingly, that you which are our Con|federates, yea Confe&s;&s;ors with us of one faith, members of one Church, and enemies of one and the &s;ame Antichri&s;t the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;hould &s;o far f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> your &s;elves, and recede &s;o far from the pious Maximes of your mo&s;t laudable Ance&s;tours, that <HI>you, I &s;ay,</HI> like a &s;purious generation, fo|&s;tred and bred up in the pure wor&s;hip of God, in the Chri&s;tian Refor|med Religion, &s;hould become enemy to your Mother, and attempt to per&s;ecute that precious faith, which hath made you great, bo&s;tering up, and a&s;si&s;ting the enemies of Gods Church, who being &s;worne Va&s;&s;als of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and intoxicated with Spani&s;h and Je&s;uiticall Ma|ximes, aime at nothing el&s;e, but in time quite and cleane to extirpate the Reformed Religion, and the pious Profe&s;&s;ours thereof. Your do|ings again&s;t the Reformed Church in the Kingdome of France, doe yet remaine fre&s;h in memory, the a&s;si&s;tance which you afforded again&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Rochel</HI> hath &s;o &s;tigmatized your Nation, that your Po&s;terity for many generations to come will not be able to raze it out. Give me leave to tell you that which all the world knowes well enough, that your Fleet &s;ent forth again&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Rochel,</HI> was &s;ufficient to have been the only cau&s;e, that (that place which was the only place of &s;ecurity in all <HI>France,</HI> for tho&s;e which were of our Religion) was lo&s;t, and con&s;equent|ly, that the condition of tho&s;e which profe&s;&s;e our Religion in tho&s;e parts was brought to that pa&s;&s;e, that now (they having no longer any place of &s;ecurity re&s;erved for them) they live only at the mercy of their profe&s;&s;ed enemies, who (as it were) have their knives upon their throats, and may di&s;patch them without any feare, when&s;oever it &s;hall be &s;u|table to their mindes, and to their occa&s;ions: The&s;e are the very cour|&s;es which you begin to take again&s;t us, indeed not as yet &s;o manife&s;t|ly, but yet not a whit the le&s;&s;e dangerou&s;ly. True, you doe not at once &s;end a Fleet again&s;t us, or a whole Army; but you &s;end &s;o many Ships &s;ucce&s;sively one after another, with all &s;orts of Warlike Ammunition, Officers, and common Souldiers, as that they may well be reputed to be a con&s;iderable Fleet or Army: and all this <HI>is done by you,</HI> to arme, to bol&s;ter up to animate the Popi&s;h Faction (who would not be able long to hold out, were they not &s;upplied with &s;uch tooles as the&s;e are from you) in&s;omuch as that, &s;o far as lyes in your power&punc; you go about to make the&s;e Conquerours again&s;t us your Brethren, and fellow-mem|bers of the &s;ame hou&s;hold of Faith.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, doth grieve and wound our &s;oules, and that not only in
<PB N="3" REF="3"> re&s;pect of our owne &s;elves, but al&s;o in re&s;pect of your own Country, and of &s;o many holy &s;oules among&s;t you, as I am certainly confident doe from their hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;orrow for the&s;e evill actions, and doe without cea|&s;ing &s;igh unto God in the heavens again&s;t them. We have hard mea|&s;ure, that we &s;hould be &s;o dealt withall by you, that you &s;hould &s;eeme to place your honour in having the greate&s;t and mo&s;t vi&s;ible hand in promoting our ruine and de&s;olation by Hi&s;paniolized and Je&s;uicicall Papi&s;ts, who by your meanes are armed again&s;t us, furni&s;hed with Of|ficers, and as it were, &s;et upon their legs by you. But I repeat it againe, <HI>(Si Deus pro nobis quis contra nos?)</HI> we hope not only to &s;tand it out again&s;t our enemies, but al&s;o to be able with honour to manage our affaires, through the helpe of the Almighty, who having as yet, and that &s;o of|ten, both again&s;t open violence and &s;ecret practices, powerfully and mi|raculou&s;ly defended us, doth thereby plentifully a&s;&s;ure us, that he will without mole&s;tation perfect that work of Reformation which he hath begunne among&s;t us, although it &s;hould &s;o fall out as that mans helpe &s;hould not only cea&s;e, but though heaven and earth &s;hould lift up them|&s;elves again&s;t us, for tho&s;e who are for us, are more then they who are again&s;t us. And yet our mercifull God doth not &s;uff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r us to want ei|ther for many de&s;irable meanes among&s;t us, or of good affections of &s;trangers from abroad toward us: we are rea&s;onably well furni&s;hed with Souldiers, Officers, Money and Weapons. Our Brethren, the Scots (whom men by all means have &s;ought to corrupt, to abu&s;e, and to make up again&s;t us) have publiquely declared them&s;elves for us the la&s;t of the foregoing moneth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and in pur&s;uance of this Declara|tion, they have di&s;patched three Commi&s;sioners, of whom one is that famous and incorrupt Zelote for the pro&s;perity of Church and State, Sir <HI>Archibald Iohn&s;ton,</HI> whom Secretary <HI>Lanerick,</HI> in the name of the King would faine, yet without &s;ucce&s;&s;e, have kept out of the forena|med Commi&s;sion. Now the&s;e Commi&s;sioners are charged in the name of the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to reque&s;t his Maje&s;ty, that he would re|turne to his Parliament a&s;&s;embled together in <HI>London,</HI> &s;igne the Act for the abdication of the Bi&s;hops, as al&s;o that he would atte&s;t the Act about the convocating of a Synod, or an Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall A&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of divers Godly and Learned Divines, for the contriving of another Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Government, different from what hath beene upheld hi|therto under the Bi&s;hops, even &s;uch as &s;hould be conformable to Gods word; that he would disbandon his Popi&s;h Armies, and be plea&s;ed as &s;peedily as may be to a&s;&s;emble a Parliament in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Unto which particulars if it plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty to yeeld, then we may quickly ob|taine
<PB N="4" REF="4"> a good under&s;tanding betwixt us: but if he &s;tand off, then our Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI> will quickly joyne in with us for the maintaining of our cau&s;e, which al&s;o is their owne. And all this &s;o far, as that our gracious God doth more and more cau&s;e us to &s;ee the meanes by which wee hope &s;peedily to &s;ee a &s;ucce&s;&s;efull and a de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue <HI>out of our troubles.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore though it doth grieve us very much to be &s;o ill dealt with|all by you yet it troubles us no le&s;&s;e to &s;ee you in the&s;e particulars &s;o much to <GAP DESC="foreign">, to fight again&s;t God. The cau&s;e which we main|taine is Gods cau&s;e, and therefore you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves, that by the&s;e indirect wayes of per&s;ecution, you doe as it were open the mouth of the Lord wide from the highe&s;t Heavens to &s;ay unto you, as &s;ome|times he did to <HI>Saul,</HI> when he was an open per&s;ecutor of the Church of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> Netherland, Netherland, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? it will be hard <HI>for thee to kicke again&s;t the pricks.</HI></P>
<P>But that I may a little the more clearly di&s;cover the equity of the&s;e my Complaints and the righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e of Gods in&s;uing vengeance, <HI>which wil take hold of you,</HI> if you goe on in the&s;e evill wayes, I have thought fitting with <HI>this Letter</HI> to tran&s;mit unto you certaine Acts of State, that by peru&s;ing of them, and of what did farther follow upon them, may at length, together with all impartiall men, come to &s;ee how hypocri|tically, unthankfully, and unmercifully you deale with us. At lea&s;t here in <HI>England</HI> we have a rule, according to which we can make no o|ther con&s;truction out of all the&s;e particulars neither doe we doubt, but that you al&s;o, if with a &s;ound judgement you will looke into things, but that you will be con&s;trained even again&s;t your &s;elves <HI>to pa&s;&s;e the like ver|dict upon your &s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, it is certaine, that &s;o &s;oone as ever that his Maje&s;ty the la&s;t Summer had withdrawne him&s;elfe from the Parliament, and reti|red to <HI>York</HI> a&s;&s;aying here to a&s;&s;emble and to draw up an Army together again&s;t his Parliament, which yet aimed then at nothing el&s;e, no more then it doth &s;till (even as you &s;ometimes did doe) but to defend their Liberties Lawes, and Priviledges to purge Gods Church among&s;t them from fal&s;ification in Doctrine and the remaining Leaven of Antichri&s;t, and &s;o to conforme them&s;elves with the Reformed forraigne Churches in Doctrine, yea in Ceremonies and Di&s;cipline, &s;o farre forth as it was po&s;sible; <HI>I &s;ay whil&s;t they were about this,</HI> men from your quarters did pre&s;ently begin to &s;econd this uncomely and incen&s;ed purpo&s;e of the King, (upon which he is put by profane Popi&s;h and Je&s;uiticall Coun|&s;ellours) with the convoy of People, Money, and warlike Ammuni|tion,

Our Parliament di&s;liking this, and fore|&s;eeing that by the&s;e dealings the foundations were laid, not onely in time quite and cleane to break off the commendable and profitable Al|liance betwixt us and your State, and to change our long continued brotherly peace into an open warre, which would be mo&s;t pernicious to both States, but that as for your parts the way was paved for our enemies, to oppre&s;&s;e Gods Church here: therfore the High and Ho|nourable A&s;&s;embly, for the preventing of the mentioned evills, thought fitting in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t to draw up and to di&s;patch an affectionate De|claration to the Lords the States Generall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of your united Provinces, which was tran&s;mitted by Mr. <HI>Walter Strickland</HI> E&s;quire.</P>

<P>VVE the Lords and Commons in <HI>Parliament</HI> a&s;&s;embled, taking into &s;erious con&s;ideration the meanes of compo&s;ing the great di&s;tempers and combu|&s;tions begun in this Kingdome, which threaten the de&s;truction and ruine of it, and of all other Prote&s;tant Princes and States, have thought good to make this Decla|tion to the high and mighty Lords, the States of the <HI>Vnited Provinces,</HI> That wee under&s;tand by a Letter of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> a per&s;on fled out of this Kingdome for high Trea&s;on: That as he often endeavoured by his wicked and malicious Coun|&s;ells to make divi&s;ion between his Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and hath been in great part the cau&s;e of that mi&s;erable and unnaturall warre which is made again&s;t us by his Maje&s;ty, &s;o he hath laboured by all meanes in the <HI>Vnited Provinces</HI> to pro|vide Armes, powder, and Ammunition for the fomenting of that warre, and ma|king it more dangerous to this Kingdome; and for this purpo&s;e did addre&s;&s;e him|&s;elfe to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by who&s;e countenance and help (as wee are informed by the Lord <HI>Digbyes</HI> owne Letters) he hath made provi&s;ion of great quantities of Ordnance, powder, Armes, and divers other other &s;orts of warlike provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>And we are further informed by credible adverti&s;ement, that the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI> in favour of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and tho&s;e other wicked Coun&s;ellours and in|cendiaries, who being joyned together in the&s;e mi&s;chievous practices again&s;t the peace of this Kingdome, hath not only licenced, but the better to encourage divers Commanders, experienced Officers, and Souldiers to re&s;ort into this Kingdom in and of them again&s;t the <HI>Parliament,</HI> hath promi&s;ed to re&s;erve their places for them in their ab&s;ence, and doth cau&s;e other provi&s;ion of the &s;ame kind to be made, and pre|pared to be &s;ent over for their &s;upply, to the great hurt of this Kingdome, and the danger of interrupting the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary profitable, and long continued amity between the two States.</P>
<P>We further de&s;ire to let them know, that we cannot believe that this is done by any authority or direction from their Lord&s;hips, con&s;idering the great help that they have received from this Kingdome, when heretofore they lay under the hea|vie oppre&s;&s;ion of their Princes, and how conducible the friend&s;hip of this Nation (concurring with the wi&s;edome, valour and indu&s;try of their owne people) hath been to the greatne&s;&s;e and power which they now enjoy.</P>
<P>Neither can we thinke that they will be forward to help to make us &s;laves, who have been u&s;efull and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in making them Freemen.</P>
<P>Or that they will forget that our troubles and dangers i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ame foun|taine with their owne; and that tho&s;e who are &s;et a worke to undermine Religi|on and Liberty in the Kingdome are the &s;ame, which by open force did &s;eeke to bereave them of both.</P>
<P>It cannot be unknowne to that wi&s;e State, that it is the Je&s;uiticall faction here,
<PB N="7" REF="5"> that hath corrupted the Coun&s;ells of our King, the con&s;ciences of a great part of our Clergy, which hath plotted &s;o many mi&s;chievous De&s;ignes, to de&s;troy the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and &s;till endeavoureth to divide <HI>Ireland</HI> from this Kingdome, by a mo&s;t wicked and cruell Rebellion there, and to divide the King from his <HI>Parliament</HI> and People here, and by fal&s;e &s;landers, and imputations of things never done nor in|tended by us, hath incen&s;ed his Maje&s;ty, &s;o as that after many bitter invectives publi&s;hed again&s;t us, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e given, he hath now at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;et up his Royall Standard, and draw his Sword for the de&s;truction and ruine of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s mo&s;t faithfull and obedient people, whom by the Lawes and Con&s;titutions of this Kingdome, he is bound to pre&s;erve and protect.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;es and the Fortunes of both E&s;tates being &s;o involved and united, wee cannot expect to be hindered by them in our ju&s;t defence, or that they will doe any thing, to aggravate the mi&s;eries and troubles of this Kingdome in the peace and happine&s;&s;e whereof they have found much advantage, and by &s;uch unfriend|ly and un&s;ea&s;onable &s;upplies of our Common Enemies, make a way to their owne a&s;well as our ruine.</P>
<P>We therefore de&s;ire they may betimes looke into this mi&s;chiefe, and having &s;earched it into the bottome, to &s;top the farther progre&s;&s;e of it, That they will not &s;uffer more Ordnance, Armour, or any other like warlike provi&s;ion to be brought over to &s;trengthen tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;oone as they &s;hall prevayle again&s;t the <HI>Parliament</HI> (according to their principles and intere&s;ts by which they are guided) will u&s;e that &s;trength to the ruine of tho&s;e from whom they have had it.</P>

<P>This, as it did mo&s;t extremely di&s;courage many Gentlemen of the Parliament, who had particular information of all the&s;e particulars, &s;o they, yea the vvhole Parliament vvere not a little exhilerated, that the Lords the States of the Province of Holland did &s;o far heed our righte|ous cau&s;e, and our complaints (vvho&s;e memory for this &s;hall ever bee ble&s;&s;ed by us) as that they vvere plea&s;ed to arre&s;t &s;ome &s;hips vvith peo|ple and ammunition, vvho othervvi&s;e &s;hould have been &s;ent again&s;t us, to the enfeebling of us.

<P>But to what purpo&s;e are promi&s;es without performances? words vvithout deeds? Is it fitting? Is it Chri&s;tian? yea, is it &s;o much as civill, to promi&s;e good things, and to doe evill things? Doth it agree with the integrity of hone&s;t men, yea of heathens them&s;elves, to ki&s;&s;e vvith the mouth, and to vvound vvith the hand? As you &s;peake, &s;o doe; for you &s;hall not be judged by your vvords, but by your deeds.</P>
<P>You promi&s;e us not to &s;uffer that any Weapons, or warlike Ammu|nition, &s;hall be tran&s;ported again&s;t us; and yet notwith&s;tanding, even after the date of this re&s;olution, and the promi&s;es made in a State-way to the Parliament, divers &s;hips did arrive from your Quarters at <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> laden with all &s;orts of vvarlike Ammunition; and others &s;ailing that way, did in their voyage fall into the hands of the Parliament and more are daily fraught and &s;ent away. I know vvell enough what u&s;u|ally again&s;t this is pretended by way of excu&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That it ari&s;eth from the covetou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Merchants, who have a thou&s;and &s;leights to doe this covertly, which cannot well be hindred in a land of Trafficke, &s;uch as yours is: But (loving Friend) may we ea&s;ily beleeve that a wi&s;e State will &s;olemnly promi&s;e to hinder that, which they doe know afore|hand that they have no power to hinder? Wherefore &s;eeing the Lords the States have made us promi&s;es concerning this, wee are able to be|leeve no le&s;&s;e but that they be able (if they have but a minde to it) to hinder the often mentioned exportation; and if they doe not this effe|ctually, it is a &s;ure &s;igne to us that they have no de&s;ire to doe it, and &s;o con&s;equently that they goe about to appea&s;e us with words. 'Tis true enough, that under colour of merchandizing much fraud is commit|ted, and that now and then &s;omething may covertly be tran&s;ported; but I am of opinion that both you and all others, men of under&s;tanding, will judge with me that it is a hard matter to &s;linke away with whole Ships loaden before the eye of all the world; and if they doe pretend to tran&s;port the Ammunition in Newtrall, or other confederate Coun|tries, it were ea&s;ie to &s;et them down &s;uch cau&s;ions, that the goods &s;hould only be delivered out in tho&s;e places and no where el&s;e; and if men were

<P>But &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome fraud might be committed in this particular, yet I doe not thinke that you will u&s;e the &s;ame excu&s;e, in regard of the Of|ficers and Souldiers, who are come over again&s;t us after the date of the often mentioned re&s;olutions and promi&s;es: for I doe not beleeve that among&s;t you, you doe u&s;e to &s;hut up men in che&s;ts or ca&s;es, coop them up in barrells, or packe them up in baskets, and &s;o &s;end them away clo&s;ed up and hid: their powder, weapons, and harne&s;&s;e may in|deed bee put up in the&s;e things, but they them&s;elves doe u&s;ually enjoy more aire, and are not accu&s;tomed like Spirits to walk invi&s;ible. Judge therefore with me, how ea&s;ie a matter it were (if your mindes were but &s;incere) to hinder the&s;e things. Here you cannot pretend covetou&s;|ne&s;&s;e, or the prevarication of Merchants for you doe no more drive Merchandi&s;e in your Countries with Officers and Souldiers, then we doe in ours; indeed they be a ware current enough but yet they bee of that nature, as that they goe and are managed of them&s;elves, not by way of negotiation, but being directed under the conduct of the highe&s;t Powers, who vvith the Centurion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">he Go&s;pel have command over them, and are able to <HI>&s;ay to this, Goe, and hee goeth; and to the other, Come, and he commeth.</HI></P>

<P>Behold this is the condition of this pa&s;port, doe you judge your &s;elfe whether I doe wre&s;t and force the words, and whether they may not conveniently be inter|preted and under&s;tood &s;o as we have &s;aid. I will not &s;ay that the Lords the States generall aimed at the favouring of the Queene, to the prejudice of the Parliaments righteous cau&s;e, contrary to their reiterated promi&s;es; I have &s;ufficiently under|&s;tood that among&s;t them there be many good Lords, who are well-affected from their hearts to the welfare of your Countrey, and of the Church of God in the &s;ame, and &s;o con&s;equently al&s;o to the ju&s;t cau&s;e of the Parliament; nor will I accu&s;e their Secretary for going beyond his Commi&s;&s;ion, indulging too much to his Pen, or perfidiou&s;ly to have &s;tudied &s;o to frame the pa&s;port, that it might be mi&s;u&s;ed by her Maje&s;ty according to her wi&s;h and contentment; and yet in the meane while, in ca&s;e any good Lords &s;hould have mi&s;liked it, might by &s;ome probable glo&s;&s;e bee well explained and interpreted.

<P>But this I can &s;ay, that we have obtained certaine and divers informations from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> from whence we doe under&s;tand that pa&s;port to be u&s;ed, or rather abu|&s;ed, much after the way that I have &s;et downe in my former conceptions; more &s;pecially, that at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Delfe</HI> haven there bee fraughted away in <HI>New-ca&s;tle</HI> &s;hips, many hundred barrels of Gun-powder, Bullets, Morters, and all &s;orts of Military Ammunition, not covertly (as formerly) but at noone day, before the eye of all the world, and that without any mans gain-&s;aying, becau&s;e it goes all un|der the name of her Maje&s;ties baggage and goods, (as indeed it is one kind of her goods, whereof all &s;orts are permitted to be tran&s;ported) therefore though men &s;ee before their eyes that it be Bullets, Gun-powder, and &s;uch like warlike Ammuni|tion, yet by vertue of the often mentioned pa&s;port, men will not looke after it: for by the &s;aid pa&s;port it is forbidden to vi&s;ite, or to &s;earch, much le&s;&s;e to open any of her Maje&s;ties baggage and goods of what &s;ort &s;oever, upon what covert or pretence &s;oever.</P>
<P>Behold the&s;e bee the fruits of this pa&s;port, which wee indeed did feare, and not without rea&s;on did apprehend would fall out &s;o, &s;o &s;oone as the &s;ame came into our hands: wherefore many Gentlemen of the Parliament here, did mo&s;t exceed|ingly wonder at it, to behold that the Lords the States generall (who had made them &s;uch good promi&s;es of neutrality and circum&s;pection) &s;hould have granted &s;uch an equivocating pa&s;port: let men &s;ay of the intention what they will, we doe not de&s;ire, neither can we judge of the hearts, that is a worke belonging to God, who one day will doe it according to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e: but this wee &s;ay, that to us it is almo&s;t all one, whether men in reference to us have a good or a bad intention, when they doe &s;o order their actions. as that from them we in all pro|bability

Give me leave to tell you, that you have dealt no better with us then <HI>Amalek</HI> did with the <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> we were weary, becau&s;e of the continuall wre&s;tlings with the &s;ecret wiles, and publike force of our enemies; and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, then you come to fight with us, and to di&s;turbe our re&s;t, through the &s;ide of tho&s;e, who aime at nothing but our perdition, &amp; at yours too in convenient time. Yea, I will &s;ay more, and maintaine <HI>Amalek</HI> to have been more excu&s;able then you, and your fault to be greater then theirs: <HI>Amalek</HI> had none of the feare of God, nor knew nothing of God; but you make profe&s;&s;ion to know him: Hee had no Covenant with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but you have a double Allyance with us. VVe are your Brethren, Children of one Father, and one Mother. We call upon one God, in the Name of one and the &s;ame Mediatour Je&s;us Chri&s;t: We profe&s;&s;e one Faith, One Religion, and have one Bapti&s;me. You doe not &s;inne through ig|norance
<PB N="29" REF="16"> as did <HI>Amaleck.</HI> VVhat are you then to expect, but that the wrath of God will once kindle more heavily again&s;t you? which will loo&s;en and untwi&s;t the foundations of your &s;tate? Doe not thinke that you &s;tand &s;o &s;ure, though as yet you &s;eeme to be &s;omething; the Popi&s;h Serpent in your bo&s;ome, the lap&s;es in your Po|licy, the fines among&s;t you &s;o enhan&s;ed, the Militia &s;o unruly, envy, and &s;tate, Am|bition &s;o much reigning among&s;t you, Corruptions &s;o common, your ine&s;tima|ble and &s;o much lamented lo&s;&s;es at Sea, which you have but lately &s;u&s;tained (con|cerning all which wee heare the reports daily with &s;orrow) doe not the&s;e ex|pre&s;ly foretell you that your State begins to totter, and will certainly fall downe, in &s;hort time, if the Lord from heaven doe not prevent it. And when&s;oever pro|ceeding as you doe, that &s;hall once certainly fall upon you, what comfort will you then finde with God, again&s;t whom you have fought by his enemies? what comfort with us your brethren, whom you have helped to ruinate? yea, with your owne con&s;cience, which then in the remembrance of that which now you doe without remor&s;e. will lamentably gnaw you, and being convicted will make you confe&s;&s;e, that it is righteous with God to recompence oppre&s;&s;ion to the oppre&s;&s;ors? In all likelihood you may now ca&s;t all this behind your backe, but the time may come quickly, in which difficulties pre&s;&s;ing upon you, the folly and perver&s;ne&s;&s;e of your &s;pirit might be more di&s;covered, and cau&s;e you (though too late) with the brethren of <HI>Io&s;eph,</HI> to complaine to one another, and &s;ay, <HI>We are verily guilty concer|ning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oule, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not heare; therefore is this di&s;tre&s;&s;e come upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you have, <HI>my beloved friend,</HI> the complaints of our Nation over you, which make us groane and cry out to God in the highe&s;t Heaven becau&s;e of you, and not to be a little &s;olicitous over you, that the threatned and righteous woe will one time or other come up|on you. If I have &s;poken &s;omewhat earne&s;tly, and now and then &s;omewhat affectionately, do you take it in good part from me, and be a&s;&s;ured that I am not tran&s;ported with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ny par|ticular pa&s;&s;ion, but with an upright zeale for to defend truth and innocency; yea, that all hath proceeded from an unfained love to the welfare of the Church of God, and Polity, not onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mong&s;t u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, but al&s;o among&s;t you.</P>
<P>I have not complained again&s;t the Commons of <HI>Netherland,</HI> whom we know out of a de|&s;ire to the pro&s;perity of the Kingdome of Chri&s;t, to be fully addicted to our cau&s;e; nor is my Letter <HI>directed</HI> again&s;t the Lords the States of your particular Provinces: they are our f iends. <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> have declared it openly, we expect no le&s;&s;e from the re&s;t, when|&s;oever time and occa&s;ion &s;hall but pre&s;ent them&s;elves, for to declare them&s;elves farther. Nor have we any thing again&s;t the high and a&s;pectable Colledge of the Lords the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">es Generall; we know that there &s;it among them many godly lovers of his truth, who have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;o &s;till made us good promi&s;es, the effects whereof we hope to reape more and more. But we complaine upon tho&s;e, who for private lucre do tran&s;port the &s;aid things to our enemies, and of tho&s;e in governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, who being carried with private intere&s;ts, know how to carry matters &s;o cunningly, that the whole&s;ome order of the Land cannot be put in execution, but the contrary be &s;toutly practi&s;ed without puni&s;hment. I &s;u&s;pect your State in this par|ticul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r to be no happier then ours, and the mo&s;t in the world; and that the mo&s;t noble members of your a&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ctable Colledge have al&s;o their boyles, wens, and hurtfull excre&s;cen|cies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n time ought by the &s;overaigne power of your Provinces to be pierced, cut off, and taken away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">f you will not run the hazard &s;hortly to peri&s;h one with another.</P>
<P>Wherefore I doe reque&s;t that you would communicate this my Letter to your knowne
<PB N="30" REF="17"> friends, or rather (if you &s;hall &s;o judge fitting) to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ke it common in Print to all. Not to &s;tir up commotions and &s;edit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, the Lord knowes my heart, (if any man &s;hould &s;o con|&s;true my writing, he would force my intention) but only to affore a Manuduction, that all the fore&s;aid di&s;orders comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tted again&s;t u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, together with the heavy con&s;equences of them, might once through good order be remedied and prevented. Which when&s;oever I &s;hall by my writing have attained unto, I do profe&s;&s;e to have gained the only aime which I had pro|po&s;ed to my &s;elfe. But if I, my native-countrey, and yours, and Gods Church in both, &s;hould prove &s;o unhappy, that my w iting &s;hould occa&s;ion more exacerbation then amendment, and you &s;hould re&s;olve to continue your former a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Gods and our enemies; yet notwith&s;tanding we do in the maintenance of Gods righteous quarrell, only through his help in the u&s;e of all good meanes, which his mercy doth as yet richly afford unto us both from within and from without, in time to become more then conquerours. And if it &s;hould otherwi&s;e fall out, that by rea&s;on of our &s;ins we &s;hould be conquered, and our weakne&s;&s;e &s;hould chance to fall under the powers which are again&s;t us, and are &s;o notoriou&s;ly &s;trength|ned by you, the Lord then will indeed be found irreprov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">able in his wayes, and righteous in his judgements, which a thou&s;and times over we have de&s;erved; but as for men, we &s;hall die in our integrity, and heaven and earth &s;hall witne&s;&s;e for us, that you mo&s;t unrighteou&s;ly have helped to de&s;troy us. We &s;hall have this re&s;t in our con&s;ciences, that we die in the maintenance of Gods truth, and the defence of his deere bought Church. You on the con|tary either falling into trouble together with us, or &s;ome while after us, will every way feele in your con&s;ciences that gnawing worme, which will never &s;uffer you to take re&s;t, but alwayes convince you, that you have helped to rend the Church, and &s;ent your weapons to the de&s;truction of his inheritance. Our gracious God be &s;o good to you, that you may bee led by another &s;pirit, unto whom I doe al&s;o pray from the bottome of my heart, that he would pro&s;per you &s;o long as you aime at his honour, and in pur&s;uance of your Chri&s;tian calling &s;eeke to pre&s;erve his little Flocke, and endevour to build up the walls of <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> as well within as without your Coun|tries.
