<HEAD>1. <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Company</HI> have been a long time a <HI>Corporation, to the Honour and Profit of this Nation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But as all <HI>Generals</HI> are made up of <HI>Particulars,</HI> &s;o it may not be ami&s;s to give <HI>&s;ome particular In&s;tances</HI> to &s;hew how they have been a long time <HI>a Corporation to the Honour and Profit of this Nation,</HI> which appears very plain by what follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> that they obtained the grant of <HI>the &s;ole Trade of the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of all others, and exer|ci&s;ed the &s;ame, though the <HI>Subjects of</HI> England, could not, nor can be excluded from it but by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> as may appear by <HI>the Kings Me&s;&s;age</HI> &s;ent to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> in <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1692. and likewi&s;e by the Opinion of the <HI>Judges,</HI> which has been given in this Matter.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have obtained <HI>the power of Seizing the Ships and Goods</HI> of their Fellow-Subjects, for Trading into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and have actually put the &s;ame Power in <HI>Erecution,</HI> contrary to <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have procured <HI>Ships outward-bound to be Arre&s;ted and Stopped in</HI> England, upon
<PB N="2" REF="2">pretence of <HI>their having notice,</HI> that they were Bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> though <HI>no Law</HI> hinders them from going thither.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have Obtained and Executed <HI>the Power of Seizing, Impri&s;oning, and Fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">g</HI> the Per&s;ons of their Fellow-Subjects for Trading into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which <HI>no Law Prohibits,</HI> or <HI>makes Criminal;</HI> and it mu&s;t not be denied, but that 'tis <HI>a Great Honour and Profit to any Nation,</HI> where a few Subjects have arrived to the Exerci&s;e of <HI>&s;uch Powers,</HI> which &s;ome of <HI>the Greate&s;t Potentates in the World</HI> cannot pretend to.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Com|menced, and Pro&s;ecuted &s;everal <HI>Suits at Law,</HI> in Actions of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> &mdash; and 200000 <HI>l.</HI> &mdash; each; again&s;t divers of their <HI>Fellow-Subjects,</HI> for Trading to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which by Law they might do; and thereby have put them to <HI>Great and Vexatious Oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> without any other Remedy than <HI>Patience,</HI> the common Comfort of all Misfortunes.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Pro|cured <HI>a Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to Execute <HI>Martial Law;</HI> and have Executed the &s;ame on <HI>the Lives</HI> of their Fellow-Subjects, <HI>contrary to Law.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Cau&s;ed the Subjects of <HI>England <HI>to be Hanged;</HI></HI> when on their Tryals they were only found Guilty of a <HI>Riot:</HI> &mdash; Which is a greater Power than <HI>the King him&s;elf</HI> has; who can cau&s;e no man to be <HI>Hanged,</HI> but <HI>by due Cour&s;e of Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They have <HI>Paid &s;uch vast Summs of Money for Cu&s;toms,</HI> although the <HI>Duties</HI> on all <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods are now &s;o <HI>extremely Low:</HI> For they have Paid in Two whole Years of their Trade, <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds;</HI> which upon the Trade they formerly u&s;ed to drive, or might now be driven, would have amounted to more than <HI>Ten Times</HI> that Summ.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They have in a manner given this whole Trade to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who now &s;upply all the World (<HI>England</HI> not excepted) with mo&s;t &s;orts of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities.</P>
<P>But however they are Commended, <HI>as Honourable, and Pro|fitable to the Nation;</HI> yet &s;ome of their Actions have been No|toriou&s;ly and Scandalou&s;ly <HI>Fraudulent</HI> and <HI>Immoral,</HI> as well as <HI>Cruel</HI> and <HI>Bloody.</HI> For the <HI>Hanging</HI> tho&s;e Per&s;ons was Voted <HI>Murther</HI> by <HI>the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and the obtaining a Grant to Execute <HI>Martial Law,</HI> and Signing In&s;tructions to put the &s;ame <HI>in Execution, <HI>were adjudged Crimes;</HI></HI> for which &s;ome Men might ju&s;tly be Excepted out of the <HI>Act of Indemnity.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome few of <HI>their Proceedings</HI> toward their Fellow-Subjects, but it would require a very large Volume to give an Account of the re&s;t of them.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<P>And Their Actions abroad, towards the <HI>Natives of</HI> India, have been no le&s;s to the <HI>Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> than what they have done to their Fellow Subjects <HI>at home.</HI></P>
<P>For, <HI>to the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> After <HI>their Factors</HI> had run in Debt Three or Four Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds at <HI>Surat, their Pre&s;ident</HI> got away from thence <HI>without Paying it;</HI> and the greate&s;t part thereof remains <HI>&V;npaid even to this day;</HI> be&s;ides the Re&s;titution which they are to make.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They gave Pa&s;&s;es to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects, for the &s;ecure Trading of their Ships; and afterwards Took tho&s;e very Ships <HI>who had their own Pa&s;&s;es,</HI> which were <HI>Plundered and Robbed.</HI> How this agrees with <HI>the Faith of Nations,</HI> let all Men judge.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They made a <HI>Cruel and Unjust War on the</HI> Mogul<HI>'s Subjects;</HI> on purpo&s;e to <HI>Plunder them,</HI> and &s;end home tho&s;e Effects; thereby to <HI>avoid Paying their Ju&s;t Debts.</HI>&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>III.

<P>You have the A&s;&s;urance of the <HI>Company's Word,</HI> which they have <HI>never yet broke,</HI> and therefore it ought not to be mi&s;tru&s;ted, <HI>that all their Charters</HI> &s;hall be confirmed by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> they having by their Behaviour <HI>&s;o well de&s;erved it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> the Company have a&s;&s;erted <HI>for Law,</HI> That the <HI>King</HI> can exclude his Subjects from the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Trade</HI> without an <HI>Act of Par|liament,</HI> which makes the Concurrence of the Parliament unnece&s;&s;ary; when <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> in his <HI>Me&s;&s;age</HI> la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions tells them expre&s;ly, <HI>That their Concurrence is nece&s;&s;ary to make a compleat and u&s;eful Set|tlement of that Trade.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> a Stock of 744000 <HI>l.</HI> will certainly drive a <HI>much greater Trade to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, and will be <HI>more National</HI> and <HI>Diffu&s;ive,</HI> and will al&s;o cope much better with the <HI>Dutch</HI> then &s;o <HI>&s;mall</HI> a Stock as <HI>Two Millions rai&s;ed by new Sub&s;criptions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> the <HI>Company</HI> by treating the <HI><HI>Regulations</HI> of the Lords of the Council</HI> with &s;o much Re&s;pect, and for the good Services which they have done the Nation, have obtained <HI><HI>a new Charter</HI> according to their own De&s;ire,</HI> which they will make u&s;e of <HI>to ea&s;e <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of their Money,</HI> who have a mind to come and &s;ub&s;cribe; therefore they pre&s;ume on the like requital al&s;o from the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by having their &s;aid Charters confirmed.</P>

<P>The Company certainly de&s;erve very well to have 744000 <HI>l. given them in that Trade for nothing,</HI> &s;eeing that if they have not <HI>&s;ome Ad|vantage,</HI> they will have great cau&s;e to complain of <HI>a bad Bargain;</HI> but they are re&s;olved, that tho&s;e who come in <HI>&s;hall pay the Fidler:</HI> And yet if any of them will be <HI>&s;o ju&s;t and honest</HI> as to help draw in the <HI>Simple and unwary, they &s;hall be &s;ecured, <HI>e&s;pecially</HI></HI> if they are of the ad|ver&s;e Party, or can talk the thing <HI>well up and down</HI> the Town; <HI>for they &s;hall have Dignified Men for their Security;</HI> that they &s;hall loo&s;e nothing; but have Principle and Intere&s;t repayed, if they plea&s;e, <HI>in twelve Months.</HI> And as for the loo&s;ing a <HI>good Name,</HI> that's a <HI>&s;illy Thing,</HI> &s;o as there be a Penny to be got by it.

<P>That it will &s;erve to enable 2 or 3 <HI>men to pay them&s;elves a con&s;iderable Sum of Money for what the Company owe them</HI> be&s;ides the la&s;t 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> which is now made a <HI>Debt,</HI> and to Pay their other Debts be&s;ides; which mu&s;t likewi&s;e be paid out of this new <HI>Sub&s;cription Money;</HI> and they &s;hall have &s;o much the more Money paid them, if they will Sub&s;cribe it in the <HI>Stock.
