<HEAD>A Mo&s;t Humble and Important REMONSTRANCE To The KING OF FRANCE. <HI>Upon the &s;urrendring of the Maritime Ports of Flanders, into the hands of the Engli&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVE bring unto Your Maje&s;ty the re&s;ent|ments of all <HI>France,</HI> or rather tho&s;e of all the Catholick parts of Europe, which crieth for Ju&s;tice upon the mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian of Kings, for one of the In&s;upportable&s;t, and mo&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">outragious injuries, that haply the Church ever yet re|ceived &s;ince its nativity upon earth. Is it po&s;&s;ible that un|der the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 14. the Altars &s;hould be o|verthrown upon the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> which his glori|ous Predece&s;&s;ors, hath &s;emented with their own proper blood in Pale&s;tine. Is it po&s;&s;ible that the victorious Arms &s;hould not be imployed but for to aboli&s;h and exter|minate the Sacraments, which &s;anctifieth them? Is it po&s;|&s;ible that that Sacrifice &s;hould be crowned, wherein the blood of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great is Immolated to the fury of a Parricide, by the inhumane bani&s;hment of the King of <HI>England,</HI> driven out of the Kingdome by his orders; nay, that the &s;hameful Sacrifice &s;hould be crowned by the pro|phanation of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Pardon, great Sir, the importunity of the &s;ubject, which con&s;trains us to open our mouths. Tho&s;e pathetick mo|tions of a mo&s;t bitter &s;orrow, are only incouraged by the Intere&s;t of your &s;acred Per&s;on, by the glory of your Crown, and by the zeal which we owe to Religion. That &s;o dilicate tenderne&s;s, we have alwayes had towards all that, which carries the &s;acred name of your Maj. can hardly ju&s;tifie to po&s;terity, the re&s;pectful &s;ilence we have kept hitherto (contrary to all the Maximes, which in all times were received in <HI>France</HI>) upon the oppre&s;&s;ion of your people, upon &s;o much inju&s;tice done to the publick and the private, upon the infraction of all the ancient Laws of the Realm; and indeed Sir, our moderation would have chang'd into prevarication and impiety, if our tongues had not followed the motions of our heart, at the a&s;pect of &s;o many eminent places, I mean tho&s;e abominable Idols, which hath almo&s;t obfu&s;cated the light of our Churches, &s;ince they rai&s;e them upon the ruines of temples, which threatneth us with the cruelle&s;t rebellion, that ever cru&s;hed a Crown, and the mo&s;t de&s;perate Here&s;ie, that ever yet attempted the di&s;honouring of the Church, and Chri&s;tia|ni&s;me.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>We doubt not, Sir, but if the providence of God, let this work fall into your hands, they will imploy all the fal&s;e colours (to render it black and odious to your Royal Judgment) wherewith, intere&s;ted flattery &s;erves it &s;elf in the Courts of great Princes, for to di&s;gui&s;e the mo&s;t important verities. They often condemn under the odi|ous titles of Libells and Pamphlets the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Re|mon&s;trances, e&s;pecially at &s;uch times, as they con&s;ecrate under the &s;pecious pretexts of your Princes &s;ervice, &s;uch actions as are mo&s;t di&s;advantagious to his State and Per|&s;on; and tho&s;e who formerly took the liberty to repre&s;ent to their Kings of the fir&s;t race, the extream prejudice which their Sovereign Authority received by the mi&s;go|vernment of the Stewards of their Pallaces, were mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;ht as Rebells, nay, at &s;uch times, as tho&s;e, who were upon the point of di&s;throning them, were re|compenced as mo&s;t faithful and obedient &s;ubjects. Sir, be plea&s;ed to judg of this piece, according to the nature of the matter its made of. If it be true, that it is a collecti|on only of detraction, and calumnies (as &s;hall be re|pre&s;ented to your Maj.) then &s;uppre&s;s it with all the rigor, that Soveraign Authority oweth to the cha&s;ti&s;ement of pre&s;umptuous licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But if on the contrary, it does only purely and &s;imply di&s;cour&s;e of the mi&s;tery of ini|quity, which they keep occult from the eyes of your Maj. and if it be not only true in all its parts, but al&s;o very im|portant to the good of your &s;ervice, and that of all your Realm, received as an in&s;piration from heaven, which hav|ing a regard of the purity of your intentions, &s;etteth be|fore you the precepts of your duty, by the groanings of your people, rather then by adverti&s;ement, which God often &s;endeth to &s;uch Monarchs, as contemneth his Law: We doubt not, Sir, but that your Maj. &s;tudies it with all the care po&s;&s;ibly you can, and that in the frequent entertain|ments of piety, which are &s;o u&s;ual to your Maj you do not &s;trongly attach your &s;elf to the Doctrine of the world, which teaches us, That one is not more obliged
<PB N="4" REF="4">to know what his Dutie is, then he is to do, &s;o much as he knoweth of the &s;ame: This obligation is indi&s;pen&s;ible and common to all the world; and certainly Princes ought to make greater reflection upon it then others, being more expo&s;ed to the danger of being &s;educed by the fallacious Sophi&s;try of Ca&s;ui&s;ts, and the artificious intrigues of their Mini&s;ters then the common &s;ort of men are.</P>
<P>All Chri&s;tendome, which admireth the greatne&s;s of your Virtues, hath not doubted but that in re&s;pect of what pa&s;t betwixt the Councel of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> of late years, the good inclinations of your Maje&s;ty were often forced by the pretended nece&s;&s;ity of your State, and your fair twins of light often troubled at the Traiterous artifice of your Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Sir, one cannot believe that your Maje&s;tie hath been ever informed of the mi&s;erable E&s;tate of the Qu. of <HI>Eng|land</HI> your Aunt, who is lea&s;t even in mendicity, only to plea&s;e the cruel A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate of her Royal Spou&s;e. One could not imagin, Sir, that the blood of the great <HI>Henry,</HI> which gives you your being, could &s;o unnaturally abandon his daughter and her little Infants even at the indigencie of bread, which never fails the mo&s;t mi&s;erable: who can ever per&s;wade him&s;elf that your royal Soul could ever have con|&s;ented to the alienation, or rather pro&s;cription of the King of <HI>England,</HI> your Cozen German and your Ally? Is it any thing el&s;e, S^r, then the Phlebotomy of your own proper blood which a fortunate Politician draws, as if it were from your veins, to &s;acrifice it to the Pannick terror of an U&s;urper? How, Sir, what imagination can figure &s;uch a thing as that the Monarch of <HI>France,</HI> Prince of the mo&s;t warlike and mo&s;t generous Nation in the Univer&s;e, could con&s;ent to &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s, as to make the noble&s;t Crown of the world &s;toop to the mo&s;t Capricious Idol that ever yet carryed favour with fortune.</P>
<P>This fal&s;e Protector of <HI>England</HI> takes a re&s;olution to Con&s;ecrate his dete&s;table Tyranny, by the preheminence he would have given his fanta&s;tical Government before
<PB N="5" REF="4">the Augu&s;t Crown of the Lil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, and <HI>France</HI> fails not to obey his orders punctually. Her Pavillion which hath for|merly triumphed over all the Nations of the world, which made the <HI>Sara&s;ens</HI> tremble, which brought terror into all the Seas, which notwith&s;tanding the rude captivity of <HI>Fran|cis</HI> the Fir&s;t, had never abated their courage before all the forces of <HI>Spain,</HI> yet this &s;o glorious a Pavillion humbleth it &s;elf at the lea&s;t &s;ignal of a Pyrate, which commandeth the Barke of a Tyrant, the murderer of your Uncle.</P>
<P>This Tyrant is not contented with all tho&s;e marks of honour, which from the fir&s;t foundation of our Monarchy was not granted to any other but him only; he pretends to more &s;olid ones, he u&s;urps and encroaches upon new <HI>France;</HI> and, as if he had not believed the advantages which he has upon your Crown to be e&s;tabli&s;hed enough by a conque&s;t, which the weakne&s;s of your Mini&s;ter ren|ders &s;o ea&s;ie to him, he &s;trives to hold the honour of your Predece&s;&s;ors; he detracts from their Glory, he abates their Trophies, by renouncing that &s;o Illu&s;trious a right of &s;o glorious a mark of their ancient Victories, of this In|violable cu&s;tome which forc't the Engli&s;h to leave their Cannons as an eternal Monument of their defeat in the mouth of the River of <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI></P>
<P>It is, Sir, as if your Mini&s;ter were of intelligence with him, to avenge the &s;hame of the <HI>Bedfords</HI> and <HI>Talbots,</HI> he forceth you even by the advice of your Council to quit tho&s;e famous prerogatives, which frameth alwayes nece&s;|&s;ary reputation to great States, in tho&s;e Treaties where you gain Nothing, where you lo&s;e Much, where you hazard All; where all things are &s;ealed up with the Augu&s;t name of a Brother, which you give to a Souldier who hath no other Throne but the Scaffold, upon which he Ma&s;&s;acred the Kindred of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>This conduct, Sir, cannot without difficulty find credit in after ages; ours does your Maje&s;ty great inju&s;tice by its pre&s;ence; neither is there that man who doth not re&s;ent with a great deal of regret, your Maje&s;ty being &s;erv'd by
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;uch blind and unfaithful Mini&s;ters, and that you &s;hould be led by the fal&s;e opticks of a feeble and ignorant Polititian.</P>
<P>There is no body condemns your Maje&s;ty; and all the world knoweth, that tho&s;e temerities and abominations pro|ceed from a meer &s;tranger, contrary in all points to the ho|ly intentions of your Maj. being &s;urprized by the &s;ame arti|ficers that hath often deceived the mo&s;t circum&s;pect Prin|ces that ever were; being &s;urprized, I &s;ay, by the &s;ame means, that made <HI>Solomon</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of Kings confe&s;s, that flattery and backbiting were the inevitable de&s;truction of Princes; but adds immediately after, that God illu|minates their hearts at the very in&s;tant of their &s;tronge&s;t temptations.</P>
<P>Behold, Sir, this is the moment, at which we ought more then ever, implore heaven for that illumination of your heart, &s;ince the iniquity of your mini&s;ter is come to its height, and &s;ince the &s;urrendring of the Sea Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Engli&s;h, can furni&s;h with &s;ufficient mat|ter the mo&s;t dangerous and pernicious temptations, that are capable to make trial of the piety of a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King. We doubt not, Sir, but your Maj. hath &s;hed tears of blood, when the&s;e precious pledges were given Here&s;ie un|der your name; neither do we doubt but that to force your inclinations to an action of that nature, they were fain to imploy all the Authority of the body politick, and of a more &s;ubtil cunningne&s;s, void of all &s;orts of religion. You have a&s;&s;uredly &s;hak'd and trembled both for the fear and anger, at the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of &s;o fatal a blow given to the Holy Catholick faith; and when you have repre&s;ented to your &s;elf her Altar demoli&s;hed, her Temples prophaned, her mi&s;teries violated, without doubt the blood of S. <HI>Lewis</HI> be&s;tirr'd it &s;elf within your entrails at the &s;ight of &s;uch &s;pectacles, as would certainly have &s;trucken horrour into the heart of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Mi&s;creant. But they over|came all the difficulties, Sir, by tho&s;e rea&s;ons by which they commonly give the rea&s;ons of the State, and becau&s;e they might have &s;ome pretext, not to di&s;cover the frailties and
<PB N="7" REF="5">ruinous foundation with which they propt them, they al|ledg &s;uch Maximes unto your Maj. as have no kind of rea|&s;on with that which pa&s;&s;eth to day in the world; and I am &s;ure they have not failed to employ all the colours that can cover and di&s;gui&s;e an action of this nature. But God, Sir, obligeth your Maje&s;ty to mingle them together, and weigh them in the &s;cales of Rea&s;on, which can ju&s;tly ba|lance this que&s;tion; and I &s;hall endeavour to expound it to your Maj. with all the candor that the &s;ubject I treat of requireth of me; and I hope to make it clearly known to you that the Councel of your Mini&s;ter upon this point, is and was both in&s;upportable and in&s;u&s;tentable by all divine and humane rea&s;ons. The mo&s;t licentious and abandoned The|ologie, nay, that is mo&s;t in&s;ervient to the maximes of <HI>Ma|chiavel,</HI> can neither maintain nor ju&s;tifie the &s;urrendring of the Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> into the hands of the Engli&s;h, but by the appearance only of a nece&s;&s;ity of State, whereby they endeavour to &s;huffle up this &s;hameful action, which is like to &s;uppre&s;s utterly our holy Faith, even in one of the mo&s;t Catholick Countries in the world, and the mo&s;t pro|found and artificiale&s;t Polititian that is, cannot defend a Re|&s;olution that doth &s;o powerfully e&s;tabli&s;h on this &s;ide the Sea the mo&s;t redoubtable and mo&s;t ancient enemy of our Crown, unle&s;s it be by the fal&s;e colours he might borrow from the imaginary health of your State. There is not that Ca&s;ui&s;t &s;o pro&s;titute in the world, no nor that Courte|&s;an upon the earth &s;o far lo&s;t, that can ju&s;tifie this action by any other rea&s;ons, then by &s;uch as are drawn (at lea&s;t accor|ding to their di&s;cour&s;e) from the pre&s;ervation of your King|dom: and of this point, Sir, which can receive no difficulty, we conclude, That to judg whol&s;omly of the que&s;tion now in hand, we are only to con&s;ider. Whether it is nece&s;&s;ary or no? which we mu&s;t &s;ound to the bottom, and let your Maj. know. That the compliance they have had upon this occa&s;i|on with the Engli&s;h, was not only inutile to the good of your &s;ervice, but al&s;o mo&s;t di&s;advantageous to your Crown, and that in all the circum&s;tances that can condemn an im|prudent and blind Re&s;olution.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>We doubt not, Sir, but they repre&s;ent unto your Maj. the great advantage you receive by tho&s;e &s;uccours <HI>England</HI> &s;ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">h to your Army, and that to induce your Maj. to follow tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions they would have in&s;pired into your heart upon this &s;ubject; they do al&s;o repre&s;ent the Engli&s;h with their &s;words in their hands, &s;tanding al&s;o up|on the pretended patrimony of their fathers. They have al&s;o made your Maj. apprehend the great danger of the Protectors combining with the Spaniard, and they have certainly &s;o in&s;inuated into your mind as to render this new a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">iance very plau&s;ibly unto you: And all that couldmake the rupture thereof &s;eem offen&s;ive to your State. But we are fident, Sir, that they have omitted more then half the con&s;iderations they &s;hould have made upon this &s;ubject, and that they have acted after the manner of them who deceiveth the &s;ight by taking away one half of the day from the objects they would have &s;hown; and that your Mini&s;ter keeps from your knowledg the mo&s;t &s;olid, and the mo&s;t important part of your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>We cannot deny, but that your Maj. had a great deal of Rea&s;on to wi&s;h the falling out betwixt <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> but we maintain you had none at all to buy the Rupture at the price of a publick Scandal, which eclip&s;eth the glo|ry of your Reign by &s;uch unparallell'd ba&s;ene&s;s, which ob|&s;cureth the &s;plendor of your Renown, by &s;uch tyes as makes you lo&s;e your ancient Allies, by &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary conde|&s;centions which makes the Protector of <HI>England</HI> Prote|ctor of the Hugonots in <HI>France,</HI> by the unbridled licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s which made them build more then forty Temples &s;ince the death of the late King your Father of Sacred Me|mory; and by the giving up of tho&s;e places which gives the entry in the neare&s;t places to your Capital City, to the anciente&s;t and mortalle&s;t enemie of your State.</P>
<P>Sir, If all the forces of the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> were tri|umphing in the mid&s;t of your Provinces, if our fields were covered with the multitude of their Legions; if all <HI>Eu|rope</HI> had con&s;pired again&s;t the <HI>Lillies,</HI> we &s;hould never
<PB N="9" REF="6">have look't for any &s;uccor from <HI>England,</HI> and if we had, certainly we &s;hould have &s;hed tears of blood to be reduced to &s;o great a &s;traight, as to &s;eek for con&s;olation in the in|fidelity of Rebels, who would never have granted us any, but to our de&s;truction. And we do firmly believe, Sir, that we &s;hall never be brought to &s;uch Extremities, as might make our intere&s;ts depend from the good will of &s;uch peo|ple as have principles &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to ours. The Divine Providence, which &s;o diffu&s;ively &s;preads its benedi|ction upon the Piety and Valour of your Maje&s;ty, hath ordained far more au&s;piciou&s;ly the events of your happy de&s;tinie, &s;till Victorious over the indi&s;creet follies of your Mini&s;ter, &s;hall more and more mark your dayes with con|tinual Victories.</P>
<P>But, Sir, Is this to an&s;wer tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of heaven? Is this to be &s;en&s;ible of the glory of your Reign? Is this to know the advantages of your Victories, to end them with the lo&s;s of your Conque&s;ts, with the &s;urrendring of <HI>Mar|dike,</HI> and tho&s;e other preambles to the Siege of <HI>Dunkirke,</HI> which they forced out of your hands even with terrible me|nances? You exhau&s;t your Trea&s;ures, you ran&s;ome your Subjects, you expo&s;e all your Nobility, all your Army is endangered every day; they fight again&s;t the element, they combat with the Rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, and all tho&s;e &s;trug|glings more then humane, hath no other motive, but the &s;ur|rendring of the Key of <HI>Flanders</HI> unto a Nation which in two hundred years could not comfort them&s;elves of the lo&s;s of that of <HI>France,</HI> in being deprived of <HI>Callais.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, who&s;oever would had &s;een that which is done to day upon the Frontire of <HI>France</HI> drawn in a Table, he would certainly have con&s;idered it as a Capricious fancie of a Painter, who would have taken plea&s;ure to play with his own imaginations; or rather of a de&s;cription of a Ma&s;que|rade, where tho&s;e who enter the Li&s;ts do only make their Swords gli&s;ter for the diverti&s;ement of the beholders. If one would have &s;hewn on the one part tho&s;e va&s;t fields of <HI>Dunkirke</HI> covered with Battalions; and on the other
<PB N="10" REF="7">part that little Territory of <HI>Mardike</HI> covered only with fourteen or fifteen hundred men, which looketh upon the motions of the others with their hands hanging loo&s;e by their &s;ides; &s;hould not one have greater rea&s;on to believe that the later were Senators of old <HI>Rome,</HI> who would for their own plea&s;ure and recreation, cau&s;e an Army of Gladiators, and &s;laves to fight before them; than to ima|gin that this great multitude were compo&s;ed of free borne|men, who with all their hearts &s;acrificeth their lives and fortunes for the con&s;ervation and glory of this handful of people? We &s;ee the remnant of 4000 men flying up and down the banks or dunes of <HI>Flanders</HI> only for the &s;ervice of 2 or 3000. Goviats or Crackropes, which <HI>England</HI> &s;ent in this &s;mall number. We &s;ee them daily continue tho&s;e &s;ad engines, and projects of this bloody &s;pectacle wherewith they make account to feed the greedy eyes of <HI>Cromwell</HI> towards the beginning of the next Campain; we &s;ee that this fal&s;e Prophet beholdeth from the top of the Tower of <HI>London</HI> all tho&s;e combats, where all the blood that is &s;pilt whether Spani&s;h or French, is drawn as if it were in a &s;acrifice, which we our &s;elves do offer to his illu&s;ions. And which is more deplorable in the&s;e tran&s;|actions, it &s;eems we are not contented to &s;ubject this age wherein we live, to the will of this tyrant, but that we do al&s;o affect to en&s;lave our po&s;terity to the Engli&s;h &s;er|vitude by &s;urrendring tho&s;e places &s;o famous and &s;o con&s;i|derable in the world.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e places are &s;o con&s;iderable, Sir, that <HI>France</HI> could not endure they &s;hould remaine in the power of <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e Naval forces are well known to be no|thing dreadful to your Maj. and your Mini&s;ter is plea&s;ed to deliver them unto <HI>England</HI> which is already Mi&s;tre&s;s of all the Seas; and who doth only con&s;ider them as the fir&s;t &s;tep or degree upon which they will hereafter mount up the ba&s;tions of <HI>Callis;</HI> if the weakne&s;s of your Mini&s;ter doth not prevent them by opening the
<PB N="11" REF="7">gates by virtue of a treaty. But, Sir.

And that which lets us &s;ee we are not deceived in this point, is, that as &s;oon as he perceived tho&s;e ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es which fru&s;trated his hope, dimini&s;h in &s;ome &s;ort, the &s;trength of tho&s;e ob&s;tacle; which his ma|lice imployed again&s;t there-union of the two Crowns; he embraces with un&s;peakable eagerne&s;s his fatal meanes of their di&s;union, forlever he precipitates with &s;uch impetuo|&s;ity to the &s;urrendring the Maritime Ports of <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is to &s;ay, an action &s;o manife&s;tly prejudicial to your Maj. &s;ervice, that one can never &s;u&s;pect his ignorance to have any &s;hare in this Treachery, but that we mu&s;t impute it intirely to his malice, which would have given this mor|tal wound to the common prace of Chri&s;tendome.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="13">
<P>One cannot, Sir, impute this &s;hameful re&s;olution to any other cau&s;e but to his inveterate malice, which made us fight under the Banners of the Protector of <HI>England,</HI> and which hath now forced us to end that field which had co&s;t us &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money, only to make a chain that might en&s;lave us to this Tyrant.</P>
<P>It is now, Sir, more then 27 years, that I do not know what &s;light, and almo&s;t frivilous intere&s;t, had made all the earth &s;hake and tremble by &s;uch an impetuous moti|on, as (if we had believed your Mini&s;ter) all the men of the world could not re&s;i&s;t; and yet in the very fir&s;t year of your unhappy Alliance with <HI>England,</HI> they deliver to <HI>Cromwell</HI> (more likely as a Homage, then by vertue of a Treaty) a Country far more con&s;iderable then all the places that had been the occa&s;ion of the breach between the two Crowns. Thus we buy an Everla&s;ting War at a price at which one might have been a&s;hamed to purcha&s;e the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary peace.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> had formerly (even by the acknowledgment of your mini&s;ter) preferred the continuation of the mi&s;eries of all <HI>Europe,</HI> before it would have left the fortifications of <HI>Nancy</HI> in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> nay, we have proffered to run the hazard of all immaginable revolutions (which are too contingent to great enterpri|zes) rather then leave one good place to a Petty Prince, even worn out by the proce&s;s of his own misfortunes. And we do now a dayes abandon &s;uch Ports as are, with|out contradiction, more important to a Commonwealth, which is far more redoubtable then the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> yet, with this difference, that in the re&s;titution of <HI>Nan|cy</HI> we might have found peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> and in the &s;urrendring of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> we have found War with all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>What di&s;order, Sir, or what confu&s;ion hath not your Mini&s;ter brought to all the Nations of the world, by this fatal action? the hopes of Con&s;olation, which alwayes accompanies and qualifies the greate&s;t misfortunes, is now
<PB N="23" REF="13">taken away from us. His cruelty in revenging the de|te&s;tation the <HI>French</HI> have of his government, and conduct of your Per&s;on, is not &s;atisfied with a misfortune, which, together with other Nations, is common to them; but he endeavours to &s;tifle in us, as much as he can, the liberty of de&s;iring, which di&s;pair it &s;elf could never utter|ly extingui&s;h in us. He di&s;turbs the mo&s;t &s;acred and in|violable of our holy Vows, and by a mon&s;trous Prodig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, which Nature yet could never parallel, we find our &s;elves (even at this in&s;tant) in an incapacity of di&s;charging the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all our obligations.</P>
<P>In how &s;ad a condition, Sir, doth a French Catholick find him&s;elf in the Churches? and at the foot of the Al|tars mu&s;t he implore the ble&s;&s;ings of God upon the Ar|mies of <HI>Spain,</HI> declared enemies of your Maje&s;ty; or mu&s;t he &s;eek the favours of heaven upon tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> which a horrid and terrible blindne&s;s imployes for the E|&s;tabli&s;hing of Here&s;ie. Which &s;hall we behold more willingly, the Cro&s;s of <HI>Burgundy</HI> di&s;played on the top of our Ba&s;tions, or that of <HI>England</HI> (which doth &s;o crimi|nally degenerate from it &s;elf) triumphing upon Catho|lick Rampiers? Which &s;hall we fooner de&s;ire, Sir, the lo&s;s of our own Colours con&s;ecrated to Almighty God in the Churches of <HI>Bruxells,</HI> or the Standarts of Ca&s;tile, dedicated to Divils in the Temples of <HI>London?</HI> What &s;hall we wi&s;h for the ruine of your Armies animated by our own proper blood, before the Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> or the conque&s;t of tho&s;e places which is, without com|pari&s;on, more prejudicial then their con&s;ervation? We feel in our &s;elves, Sir, we feel in our hearts a Combate of Religion again&s;t the State, and of the State again&s;t it &s;elf: Shall we run next Summer to the Siege of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> then to that of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> &s;o to <HI>Newport,</HI> and all this to follow our Natural inclinations to obey our Prince? Or &s;hall we &s;tay at home, and implore the protection of God upon tho&s;e places, which &s;erve as much, at lea&s;t, in the hands of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that they give the weakne&s;s of your Mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="24" REF="14">&s;ome means to &s;atisfie <HI>Cromwells</HI> ambition for a year; by &s;ome other way then the giving up of <HI>Call is</HI> and <HI>Bullin?</HI> &s;hall we in the Winter prepare branches of <HI>Lawrell</HI> to Crown the &s;acred head of our Prince the next &s;pring or &s;hall we draw into a &s;olittude, to bewail a misfortune that makes them wither as &s;oon as they are gathered?</P>
<P>In how doleful E&s;tate, Sir, and in how deplorable con|dition doth poor <HI>France</HI> find it &s;elf? at this very in&s;tant it &s;eems &s;he doth delight to &s;poil her &s;elf of all tho&s;e glori|ous advantages, &s;he had obtained over <HI>England</HI> in Ages pa&s;t? it doth not &s;uffice her now to efface the lu&s;tre of her ancient Victories by this &s;ervile and dependant War, which &s;he make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> under tho&s;e Standarts, which &s;he hath formerly with &s;o much glory rent to pieces, but &s;he mu&s;t yet for the &s;atisfaction of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> renounce the reputation &s;he had acquired in the negotiations, and Treaties, they reckon, Sir, 600. years between the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and that of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the unfortunate marriageof <HI>Al|cenor</HI> of <HI>Guienne</HI> and tho&s;e who make up this number, mark very judiciou&s;ly that the Engli&s;h who were never-yet weary of conte&s;ting the glory of Arms with our Nation, were forc'd to yerld to them at lea&s;t in points of Wi&s;dome and Policy.</P>
<P>But alas! Sir, this advantagious opinion which we could never cheri&s;h with two much care in the hearts of all peo|ple, is now Ravi&s;hed and buried in this la&s;t fatal Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> now we make <HI>England</HI> amends for all the for|row we caus'd her in former times, in defending our &s;elves &s;o wi&s;ely from all her &s;ubtleties, &amp; &s;urprizes; the &s;ole nego|tiation of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> &s;hall &s;ufficiently revenge her to po&s;terity of all tho&s;e advantages we have gain'd upon her in more then 600 Treaties, and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s fiercene&s;s, Victorious over the imbecillity of your Mini&s;ter &s;hall here|after quite extingui&s;h the glory of our ancient politicians: Open your eyes then Great King upon this fatal blindne&s;s, upon this horrible illu&s;ion, which rather ob&s;cures then &s;tops tho&s;e glorious exploits, which all Chri&s;tendome exnects from your Royal Virtues.</P>

<P>Open your eyes, great Prince, upon the lo&s;s of your Allies, which they drive ever with violence out of your intere&s;ts, by the de&s;pair they are daily driven to by the ap|prehen&s;ions they have that your Mini&s;ter will never put an end to the mi&s;eries of <HI>Europe.</HI> Open your eyes, great Prince, upon this mortal wound they have given to the general peace, which is the only object of the groans and tears of your people, which is a&s;&s;uredly the final end of your de&s;ires, and &s;hall be the work of your Piety and Wi&s;|dom, if God be Exorable to the Prayers and wi&s;hes of all your mo&s;t Faithful Subjects.</P>
