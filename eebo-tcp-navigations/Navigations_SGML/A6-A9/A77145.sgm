The great Duke declared he &s;hould not &s;tay in his Territories, or come a&s;hore into his Town, he comes to me; Oh &s;aith he, this almo&s;t breaks my heart, to think that you &s;hould go to fight, and I go home to an&s;wer what is al|ledg'd again&s;t me. My Lieutenant al&s;o having heard him &s;adly expre&s;s, he knew they &s;ent for him into <HI>England</HI> to que|&s;tion his life: Truly I could not but pity the man, and an|&s;wered, Captain <HI>Appleton,</HI> it's a dangerous thing to dally with the Commands of the Councel of State: But &s;ince the Captain of this Ship, <HI>Jonas Pool,</HI> cannot be &s;ent for from <HI>Ve|nice</HI> in any time, if you be real indeed, and that your peace can be made with the great Duke, I will be your friend to further you all that lyeth in my power, and to that purpo&s;e Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> and a Councell of Officers &s;hall be called toge|ther to con&s;ider of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and there upon Debate it was concluded in the Affirmative, if he could procure that leave as before: Oh but then how &s;hould he get that leave! I an&s;wered not (at that private meeting or Councell) as he in his <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> (like &s;ome Chancery Bils) &s;aith, it was then agreed he &s;hould give &s;ix hundred Dollars to buy his peace, which is a mo&s;t notorious untruth, there was not one word about Dollars &s;poken there; but I &s;aid to him, your be&s;t way in my opinion was, to confer with Con&s;ul <HI>Read,</HI> who hath great friends at Court, and it may be by means of a little greace to his Highne&s;s Secretary, or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, and upon your humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he wil remit your offence; and it &s;eems it was &s;o effected after I was gone: but if it co&s;t him more to do it then his fea&s;ting with the great Duke was worth, it will &s;hew he hath been as &s;imple as he is now malitious. In all ages &s;ome there be that will reward others evil for their good; I think it would have been a good bu&s;ine&s;s for this man, who feared the que&s;tioning of his life at home, to have an opportunity given him, that by his Gal|lantry in Service, he might have done &s;omthing to remove
<PB N="13" REF="7">that fear, as al&s;o the di&s;-reputation, which otherwi&s;e he could not.</P>
<P>And then as to his Engagement at la&s;t, wheras no effectu|al cour&s;e was taken to rid him&s;elf of tho&s;e &s;hips that were on board him, after our example in the <HI>Paragon,</HI> who notwith|&s;tanding a great number of men were killed and wounded on the upper Deck and el&s;e-where, to the number of about four&s;core, &s;o that all was ordered to withdraw thence but the Commander him&s;elf; and howbeit almo&s;t as many were run down into holes, the Enemy being bord and bord: and although the Fleet had all left her without any encourage|ment, yet three or four&s;core men was got up to bear away the Enemy by main force of hand; how much more &s;hould they have done it, that had &s;o much encouragement as their Admiral, and other their friends, to be within two or three &s;hips length of them; and although I was &s;o neer as about Musket-&s;hot off, about half an hour together, not &s;eeing a Man, &s;tirring upon the upper Deck, I think it a great fault in a wi&s;e Vice-admiral, what ever it be thought of the <HI>Remon|&s;trancer:</HI> And although an Anchor was not let go, which was the duty of his place to have order'd, for &s;o the Ship in all likelihood had been &s;av'd. Nay, as there is good te&s;timony, although I had heard, when my Lieutenant was on bord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> to tell him how effectually I recommended to him the coming forth; but they neglecting it, his Mate <HI>Wrighting|ton,</HI> whom he highly commended to me, I am &s;ure a man that knew when it was a fit &s;ea&s;on for them to &s;ail, he was at their neglect &s;o tran&s;ported in pa&s;&s;ion, that he either &s;tampt, or tore his hair, or u&s;ed &s;ome &s;uch ge&s;ture, &s;aying, <HI>The&s;e cur&s;ed men</HI> (meaning the Captains) <HI>are be&s;otted, or bewitched to this Mould; why cannot we go to Sea now we have &s;o gallant an opportu|nity, and that the Admiral &s;ends for us.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, that neither in my Narrative, nor el&s;e how I &s;hould cry up this mans faults, but rather take a garment to cover them, when as I &s;ay he was forward to come out, but over|powred by others, forbore it; yet after all, that a mans heart &s;hould be &s;o like a Forge, to blow up coals of Mi&s;chief and Fal&s;ities on another (which are like to fall on him&s;elf) could
<PB N="14" REF="8">hardly have been imagined, but that Experience &s;hews it.</P>
<P>One word more of the Witne&s;&s;es, by many Letters that came to <HI>Porte Longone</HI> from Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> Con&s;ul <HI>Read,</HI> and others, wherein was Complaints upon Complaints of Cap|tain <HI>Seaman,</HI> and another. I &s;ay, what&s;oever reports came from <HI>Legorn</HI> concerning their backwardne&s;s, or rather &s;tub|bornne&s;s to come out with others of their Neighbours under the &s;ame obligation with them&s;elves, as we u&s;e to &s;ay; he that hath but half an eye in his head, and one dram of ho|ne&s;ty in his heart, knowing what then pa&s;t, as that there was but four &s;hips of the Enemies in <HI>Legorn</HI> Road; and as Cap|tain <HI>Appleton</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;eth, the Enemie that fought us was &s;hattered as much as we: if they had come to our Relief, we mu&s;t have been (in humane appearance) in <HI>England</HI> with the Merchants great Cargazon long before the la&s;t yeer end|ed. And yet I wrote not any thing to tho&s;e in Power or any others that I remember again&s;t the&s;e by name, that were the cau&s;e of &s;o much lo&s;s and damage as the Nation received thereby.</P>
<P>Again, about the beginning of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, &s;eeing a &s;tout gale of wind of the &s;hore, it was much on my heart to go out at that time; and &s;eeing but nine of the Enemies men of War in the Road, and there could be expected but two more in the Offing: A Councel of Officers being called, the Que&s;tion was carried from me, and an&s;wered in the Negative; and why Captain <HI>Seaman,</HI> &s;aid he? it's the way to lo&s;e three or four good &s;hips, &s;hewing cowardize enough I think. It was replyed, not &s;o I trow; here is be&s;ides others the <HI>Leopard,</HI> the <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> the <HI>Samp&s;on;</HI> and &s;ince I have gone to Sea, any one of the&s;e would not fear half a dozen, or the whole num|ber of the&s;e our Antagoni&s;ts; but what &s;aid Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> to me, you do but &s;trive again&s;t the Stream, in &s;eeking to get out the&s;e Ships, they think they &s;hall have their pay, and then it's no matter what &s;ervice they do; you mu&s;t get Ships el&s;e-where to fetch them hence, if you will make any u&s;e of them; whereupon I wrote (upon that very &s;core) &s;omewhat pa&s;&s;ionately unto the Councel of State among other matters, the en&s;uing pa&s;&s;age.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I wrote al&s;o another Letter to a Friend at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> to this effect: <HI>I wi&s;h it may not &s;o fall out, that the State had better give a hundred thou&s;and pounds a &s;hip, and ten pounds a month to a Marriner, then that their &s;hips &s;hould lie in</HI> Legorn <HI>Mould &s;o long, without any relief.</HI></P>
<P>And further; however I wrote not a word again&s;t this man, but when I came to &s;peak of the <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> in my Narra|tive, hid all his failings, &s;aying; That the Ship being taken aback&s;taies, the Enemy had opportunity to fire her: yet Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> (who I beleeve would write no &s;uch thing without good proof) &s;aith, it's no &s;uch matter; The Captain and Company run under hatches, and did not look after trim|ming of Sails as they &s;hould have done.</P>
<P>But now, as if he were no &s;mall Proficient in <HI>Machiavels</HI> School, in hopes that &s;omething may &s;tick, writes hideous things again&s;t me, that made &s;ome of his Kindred talk of coming to Execution Dock, of tho&s;e that with-drew from <HI>Legorn;</HI> and &s;ince his return for <HI>England,</HI> his malice hath been let out to the full, charging me with horrid falficies.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> another of the Witne&s;&s;es, knoweth very well that when his great failings hath much tran&s;ported me, &s;o after keen arguments in private, and promi&s;e of amend|ment, I have been civil towards him: And though he hath put his hand to Capt. <HI>Appletons</HI> Remon&s;trance, that would make men believe Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> were one of the verie&s;t Vil|lains in the world; yet coming to my hou&s;e &s;ince his coming home, he told me he could not but vindicate Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> when he was &s;poke again&s;t, and therefore in their home|ward way, he was call'd by the re&s;t, <HI>Longlands</HI> creature, but it may be this man was meerly drawn in, and therefore I pitie him.</P>
<P>Again Captain <HI>Ell,</HI> after he had pre&s;umptuou&s;ly left the Convoy, where all care was taken for his pre&s;ervation, once and again, being come to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> upon his acknowledgment
<PB N="17" REF="9">I pa&s;s'd tho&s;e things by. Four dayes after, in <HI>Circa,</HI> being a|bout ten leagues from <HI>Zant,</HI> he tels me he had a mind to be gone for <HI>Smirna;</HI> but I an&s;wered, have a care what you do, le&s;t you loo&s;e the &s;hip your friends have intru&s;ted you with|all, I mu&s;t carry my bu&s;ine&s;s before me, in regard the <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tops there: but I intend not to Anchor there, if the wind be fair. Well &s;aith he, I will &s;peak with you again, yet did not, &s;lipping away in the night. But though pragmaticall &s;elf-conceitedne&s;s was judg'd a higher Tower then the Convoy, it was a thou&s;and to one it had not occa&s;ioned his Mer|chant, and Owners to bid farewell to their Ship and Goods, for had not a &s;trong gale of wind brought him in after us to <HI>Zant,</HI> four <HI>Turks</HI> Men of War had call'd him to an account, This made me hint to the Committee of the Navy, how the Convoy was &s;lighted, as it was by him unto the very la&s;t. But to &s;ee how things are carried by way of Retalio, he and others wel know, and the <HI>Levant</HI> Companies pur&s;es hea+vie&s;t feel.</P>
<P>Yet being he had embraced the States Service afterwards, I advis'd him, no man &s;hould be more willing to pa&s;&s;e by prejudicatedne&s;&s;e of opinion again&s;t him, then my &s;elf, as may appear by my Letters to him: However, after he had been in the &s;ervice of the State a few weeks, I &s;ent him an Order to go for <HI>Naples,</HI> or <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">na:</HI> yet he &s;tayes, putting the State unto charge of &s;ome hundred pounds, which fault he laid on his men; and although I have heard the contrary, yet I winked at that time, and hitherto mentioned nothing of it.</P>
<P>Next, in our Engagement at <HI>Legorn,</HI> &s;uch was his failing, that I told him and others, at our very next meeting, after we came thence: Tho&s;e that had nimble &s;hips were extream|ly too blame: But &s;aid I, &s;ince we are home-ward bound, and I know not what eminent Service we may be call'd too for the Honour of the Nation, I will not cau&s;e contention now among you; but where ever there hath been a failing, let every man amend one next time, and one would have thought it would have wrought upon ingenious &s;pirits.</P>
<P>But after we came to the Bay of <HI>Legos,</HI> I &s;ent a Warrant
<PB N="18" REF="10">to him to &s;pare two men, exchange of 2 <HI>Dutch</HI> men, to help man the <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Prize, yet he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, al|though earne&s;tly advis'd to the contrary by Captains, and others about him, that told him he could never an&s;wer it, yet peremptorily he denied it. Whereupon I bid the Cap|tains, and others about me to take notice; he and his Con|&s;ort <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> that made the like refu&s;al, were di&s;charg'd out of the States &s;ervice, and that I would never give them any kind of order more, untill we came to the Generals, where their contempt &s;hould be laid open, and I did forbear know|ing any of them a long time.</P>
<P>But at length through per&s;wa&s;ion of friends, and their own &s;ollicitations in publique and private, to forgive that one failing, what amendment &s;hould I &s;ee, I was prevailed with all to lay a&s;ide prejudice.</P>
<P>Although I &s;uppo&s;e by this time, that he very well knew that howbeit upon his own quarter Deck (as &s;ome prag|maticall men in former times have done) he might cry, <HI>Am not I king now? am not I King now?</HI> Yet by the Laws Martial, which were either made to be put in Execution, or to be like Bug-bears which are to skare children, all the Councel he can find in <HI>England,</HI> can hardly &s;ave him from a mo&s;t &s;e|vere &s;entence for his contempt.</P>
<P>Again, coming into the <HI>Downes,</HI> this Captain Ell comes to me in the Evening, de&s;iring he might have leave to go to <HI>Canterburie</HI> to meet his Wife; yea &s;aid I, go, but pray be here &s;peedily, I know not what Orders may come from Au|thority, nor who &s;uddenly may appear on the back of the <HI>Goodwin</HI> to engage us; In words he would comply, and re|turn accordingly; but was wanting thence ten dayes, and upward, as if (at lea&s;t) he were a Prince, not to be accomp|table for any di&s;&s;ervice to the State, which cau&s;ed his men to mutiny, when his Ship was ordered to go to Sea. All this time I wrote nothing again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Next they bring in one <HI>Whiting,</HI> that was heard &s;ay &s;o, and &s;o, it may be it is true as &s;poken from him; but I deny that I ever &s;pake &s;uch things, neither is there any rea&s;on or &s;en&s;e for why I &s;hould. But admit the latter had been true,
<PB N="19" REF="10">it would have &s;hewed ingratitude enough in him, a man who&s;e life and freeedom I had fir&s;t beg'd of the great Duke, and then at my reque&s;t his e&s;tate, and his worthy and grate|full friends (by the rule of contraries) to the value of 3000 crowns, and the &s;hip, all &s;entenc'd for lo&s;t, and confi&s;cated, were reprieved, remitted, and given back to them; at length being made Commander of the Fire-&s;hip, his wretched cowardize in not pro&s;ecuting the work he was &s;ent about, with Main-&s;aile and all: which had he done, having &s;uch an opportunity as he had upon the <HI>Dutch Admiral,</HI> for ought I know it might have turn'd the day; and then the ba&s;e lea|ving the next man to him&s;elf behind him, would have caus'd many a man to have brought him home in chains, and tryed him for his life; and if &s;o, I know not what would have become of him.</P>
<P>In fine, I have alwayes endeavour'd to govern with &s;ere|nity, mixt with &s;ome authority, and rather by multiplyed acts of Civility have laboured to engage them, then by ri|gorou&s;ne&s;&s;e to di&s;hearten them: and let who&s;e will &s;ay to the contrary, I have been alwayes ready to cry up to the height in any &s;ervice of worth in them, and have covered all fail|ings at the &s;ame time, as my Letters to Authority do witne&s;&s;e for me.</P>
<P>But we &s;ee not only many of the Proverbs fulfill'd now and then, but old Stories.

<P>But not to be tedious in rehear&s;ing ingratitude, I &s;hall re|turn to the <HI>Remon&s;trance,</HI> where I find Mr. <HI>Redding</HI> magnified in an employment he was &s;ent on by M. <HI>Longland,</HI> who with the decea&s;ed Captain <HI>Wood,</HI> is vilified to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A word of the former, of whom <HI>Ditto,</HI> Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> en|form'd me &s;omething, as that Captain <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;hould create him Agent, and that he went to <HI>Florence</HI> contrary to his ad|vice, and at the great Dukes Court he made Ma&s;ter <HI>Longland</HI> be look'd on as an Impo&s;tor, which forc'd him to &s;end away
<PB N="20" REF="11">from <HI>Florence</HI> in the night for his Commi&s;&s;ion. I al&s;o heard him &s;ay, that for ranting in <HI>Naples,</HI> wherein he and his Com|pany kill'd a Child, or for &s;hooting at the Ju&s;tice, he was ar|raign'd at the Bar on life and death; yet by crying out he was forc'd to fly from his Country in his Kings Cau&s;e, it fell out &s;o, that he was &s;av'd on a general day of grace, and &s;et free with fellons, and murtherers: but as for &s;ervice for the Common wealth of <HI>England,</HI> I heard of none he did; yet if by a day of grace of greater advantage, his &s;pirit is changed, that now he &s;hal think of doing it in good earne&s;t, I &s;hall be very glad.</P>
<P>Next a word of Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> one of the abu&s;ed per&s;ons in charity I can do no le&s;&s;e then &s;peak out a word of my knowledg concerning him, and the dead: It's 16. yeers &s;ince I knew Mr: <HI>Longland</HI> fir&s;t at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and as he then &s;hewed him&s;elf as grave; &s;ober, di&s;creet, and as religious a Mer|chant as ever I met withall abroard: So ever &s;ince the Parli|ament begun (oppo&s;e who would) as there wanted not Scoffers, and Oppo&s;ers enough in tho&s;e parts, he would &s;till ju&s;tifie the Parliaments proceedings, and the Armies, as by very many Letters of his appeareth altogether as freely and effectually before, as &s;ince he was the States &s;ervant: &s;o that although they might have Friends abroad, I am confident they had no man like minded, that hath made it &s;o much his &s;tudy to advance the Benefit, and honour of the Nation, and good people in his re&s;tle&s;&s;e motions that way, and to rejoyce at their good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, as if he were to be look'd up|on more like a State&s;-man, then a Merchant; and he de&s;er|ved not the imputation of &s;uch a wicked wretch, as would betray the States Captains into Pri&s;on, and &s;end away a Po&s;t into <HI>England</HI> to complain of the <HI>Remon&s;trancer;</HI> and then for Captain <HI>Appleton</HI> to &s;ay the decea&s;ed Cap: <HI>Wood</HI> tri|umphed over him, I dare &s;ay is a mo&s;t fal&s;e thing, in that there are many can te&s;tifie he was a man re&s;tle&s;&s;e to &s;erve o|ther Captains in their nece&s;&s;ities (who had &s;hewed them &s;elves his great enemies) in &s;o high a nature, as that the like can hardly be parallel'd, and &s;o much I can further &s;ay for the &s;aid Captain, according to what Mr: <HI>Longland</HI> denotes
<PB N="21" REF="11">(as his opinion) in his Letter to me at my fir&s;t coming into <HI>Porto Lon|gone,</HI> he was a man more readier to &s;erve the State, then &s;uch as eat their bread, before ever he entred into the States &s;ervice to receive their pay, not only in taking care to ha&s;ten Ammunition, and other things to me at my fir&s;t harbouring in <HI>Longone,</HI> but otherwi&s;e. And if Captain <HI>Apple|ton,</HI> and Captain <HI>Seaman,</HI> the letter of which &s;truck him as I have heard, for expre&s;&s;ing his zeal to the States Affairs; I &s;ay, had they hearkned to his coun&s;el, or tho&s;e keen Arguments he us'd to draw them forth to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in <HI>Porto Longone;</HI> at my fir&s;t coming there, we had been in <HI>Eng|land</HI> long &s;ince; and all along to his death, he was a faithful, &s;tout ho|ne&s;t man, and one that to his la&s;t breath would acknowledg their de|&s;truction was of them&s;elves, they did not follow Order, and went out too &s;oon in the morning, being they went not in the night.</P>
<P>But again to the <HI>Remon&s;trance:</HI> Whereas he &s;aith, that he &s;tir'd about taking the <HI>Phaenix</HI> Frigot by my order, if I forget not, that will prove very fal&s;e, becau&s;e he had hindred it once before, and &s;o I was minded to make no further u&s;e of him in that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, yet I do not deny, but that (without giving di&s;turbance to the Dukes Port) I ordered that &s;he &s;hould be &s;tollen away from the drunken <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e I picked out (at was Capt: <HI>Cox</HI> his de&s;ire) &s;ome chief per&s;ons: and ha|ving encouraged them all that lay in my power, I &s;ent them away a|bout it, and at the time it might have taken place, I went on the moun|tains to &s;ee her &s;teal away, at my return being certainly inform'd how it had taken effect, to the joy of my heart, being confident it was as good a piece of &s;ervice as could be done the Nation at that time: And &s;o the Councel of <HI>State</HI> e&s;teemed it, when they were pleas'd to give Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> and my &s;elf thanks for it: And truly if &s;uch &s;ervice meet with no kind of e&s;teem, &s;uch an ill Con&s;equence may follow, as that tho&s;e that eat the States bread, will turn as very Drones as their hearts can de&s;ire, who are on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>And Cap. <HI>Appleton</HI> well knoweth; if not, I am &s;ure I have heard, at fir&s;t the great Duke commended the Exploit, &s;aying the Turks had &s;tole her away from the drunken Flemmings, whil&s;t they minded their bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e no better, and all &s;eemed to be covered, &s;o that in many dayes after, the Duke &s;ent me not a word about it; and it's judg'd (by pru|dent men) he would never have taken notice of it as a di&s;turbance to his Port; had not that fooli&s;h childi&s;h act of Captain <HI>Appletons</HI> in taking the <HI>Dutch</HI> man out of his Centinels hou&s;e, with his own hand (as if he had been Lord Paramount in that Countrey) highly incens'd him, as indeed it would any other Prince, or State in the like Ca&s;e.
<PB N="22" REF="12">And when the great Duke did di&s;patch away a Me&s;&s;enger to me to la|ment that high affront in his fir&s;t Letter, as one in whom the thoughts about the <HI>Phaenix</HI> Frigot were utterly extinct, and drownd, he mentions not a word to me of that bu&s;ine&s;s, until his &s;econd Letter came long af|ter, and then I could do le&s;&s;e then own it, and labour to ju&s;tifie it, as I can do now more fully.</P>
<P>And I could wi&s;h al&s;o, that Authority had been plea&s;ed to have done it more effectually in their An&s;wer, and not leave Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> and my &s;elf (their Servants) in &s;ome kind of difficulty, or &s;hame upon us about it. For I fear it opened a gap to &s;ome further trouble.</P>
<P>Now to prove that the &s;aid Act was no di&s;turbance or affront to his Port (or at lea&s;t) ought not to have been e&s;teemed &s;o without great par|tiality, it is clearly thus, again&s;t which (I believe) there can be no rati|onal Objection.</P>
<P>Some weeks before the <HI>Phaenix</HI> was &s;urprized, a &s;mal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip bound for <HI>Barbary,</HI> comes out of the <HI>Mould,</HI> and was &s;hot at by the <HI>Dutch</HI> men of War, with divers &s;hot, and they afterwards chas'd her; now if the great Duke accounted that no di&s;turbance, &s;o as to make a publick com|plaint, by impri&s;oning the Captains, denying them provi&s;ions, or by &s;ending an extraordinary Me&s;&s;enger into <HI>Holland.</HI> Then he ought not to account Capt. <HI>Cox</HI> &s;lipping away with the Frigot (after the drunken fit of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was over) in &s;uch a manner as that the ve&s;&s;el (being far without &s;hot of his Cannons, when the attempt was made) did get a|way, and yet not di&s;cerned by his people from the &s;hore, to be any af|front, or di&s;turbance at all to his Port.</P>
<P>But if it be objected here, they did the Duke &s;ervice therein, in regard it was contrary to his Laws that a Ship &s;hould carry <HI>Lead</HI> to <HI>Barbary:</HI> I an&s;wer, they might have acquainted him with it while &s;he was in his <HI>Cubert,</HI> or in the <HI>Mould,</HI> and not let him know of it afterwards by the ratling of their &s;hot. And thus I have an&s;wered the <HI>Remon&s;trancer</HI> in that particular, wherein peradventure he hop'd I would have come under the La&s;h of Ju&s;tice for breach of Orders; but he is not &s;o &s;ecret in lay|ing the plots of his malice, but it may be as openly di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Again, the next thing mentioned at his coming to <HI>Legorn</HI> the la&s;t time is, That the Dukes Secretary, my &s;elf, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> had concluded to Fight; A pretty &s;tory, that made me &s;mile, though malice enough lye under the&s;e &s;inders; but as cunningly as the <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> is dre&s;t up, the knots about it are not &s;o tied, but a little skill and hone&s;ty is able to un|do them all, and make the filthine&s;s that is underneath, to be &s;ufficient|ly di&s;covered. I know there was a Treaty, if you will have it call'd &s;o,
<PB N="23" REF="12">between the Dukes Secretary, Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> and my &s;elf, as there was it may be the &s;ame between the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that Secretary, but to &s;ay be|tween us three was a Treaty, is a horridfal&s;ity, or much le&s;s, that it was concluded among&s;t us to Fight the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and yet the &s;earcher of hearts mu&s;t be appealed unto in this thing, among&s;t other fal&s;ities, as if they were very truth; Great impiety, and God may be a &s;wifter witne&s;s again&s;t fal&s;e Swearers, then they are aware of.</P>
<P>One would wonder to &s;ee how the Great Dukes failings &s;hould all be covered by Cap. <HI>Appleton,</HI> who&s;e name he could not mention, except with a &s;corn, but that we know by an old practice, Two arch enemies wil make friends to bring about their ends upon tho&s;e that are faithful</P>
<P>There's not a man or Boy in the Fleet, but mu&s;t needs take notice, that the Great Duke thru&s;t us out of his Port, and that after all means had been u&s;ed for the gaining of thirty days time, until our <HI>Venice</HI> &s;hips that had co&s;t the State of <HI>England</HI> &s;o va&s;t an Expence, came up to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in&s;omuch that Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> and my &s;elf, proffered the Great Dukes Secretary as much money as the <HI>Phaenix</HI> Frigot was worth, to give the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or do what he would withall, and although he knows thereupon, what a Speech I made in the face of each Ships Company, &s;aying, our condition was much like tho&s;e <HI>Leapers</HI> we read of: The Great Duke commanded us to be gone hence in ten dayes time, and if not, here are more Guns brought down (for ought I could perceive) to expiate our De&s;truction; &s;o that if we &s;tay any longer we mu&s;t peri&s;h, and if we go forth, we can do no more; wherefore as Gods providence had put us on &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous &s;ervice, &s;o I hop'd our &s;ins &s;hould not hinder his High appearance with us in it; &amp; the ri&s;e I had from thence, to &s;tir them up to quit them&s;elves like Engli&s;hmen, was not unknown. And though he very well knoweth in the &s;teerage of every &s;hip it was pa&s;ted up, to this effect, That whereas the Great Dake had required us to go thence in &s;o &s;hort a time, each individual man, as wel Captains as others, were therefore required to give their attendance to their re&s;|pective Shipt, and not to go thence on &s;hoar upon any terms, without &s;peciall leave, as they would an&s;wer the contrary at their perils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover, though he very well knew the Duke had an opportu|nity to procure our Conjunction (or at lea&s;t) to have caus'd our Enemy to have gone out, and Fought us in the Sea, yet &s;lighted it, &amp; at length &s;et at liberty the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains, and many of their Marriners, which he had in Pri&s;on, &amp; though our Ships were taken very near the <HI>Mould</HI> head, &s;hoots not a &s;hot in their defence; yet notwith&s;tanding all this, Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> takes no notice of it, as if he would Petition him for the
<PB N="24" REF="13">money back again, which he &s;aith it co&s;t him formerly to procure his pardon.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;ome wil &s;ay (as I have heard they have already) the Great Duke is a Worthy and Magnificent Prince, and wrote you, that the &s;hips might &s;tay longer in his <HI>Mould,</HI> if there was a nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer: Truth is, untill we had a lo&s;s here in <HI>England</HI> of the <HI>Gar|land,</HI> and other &s;hips, I had very good re&s;pect from him, (and I endea|voured with as much reverence, re&s;pectivene&s;s, and thankfulne&s;s to ac|knowledge the &s;ame) and he told me he was not my Friend &s;o much becau&s;e I was in an eminent Employment for the State, but upon an old &s;core, I might Command him, yet the News of a fore-mentioned lo&s;s turned the &s;treame pre&s;ently; for like Politicians they took the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide, and then I could no more be heard in what was but Ju|&s;tice and rea&s;on, then if tho&s;e words had never come out of his mouth. <HI>I</HI> very wel know what was wrote in an&s;wer to mine, about the latter end of <HI>Feb:</HI> la&s;t, <HI>I</HI> de&s;ired when winds and weather hindred my coming to <HI>Legorn</HI> (within the time limited) it might be lookt upon as a ju&s;t impediment. The An&s;wer runs thus, <HI>You &s;hall have eight days added to the former, and longer if nece&s;&s;ity required.</HI> What nece&s;&s;ity is that, but the being cro&s;t by winds and weather: for all men know, vvho u&s;e tho&s;e parts, that the Northerly wind bloweth &s;ometimes &s;o fre&s;h, that a man may be put to Lee|ward, &s;o that in eight days he cannot get up to <HI>Legorn</HI>-Road. If he had meant other|wi&s;e, that knew how importunate I was, But for thirty days time, would have &s;aid, take the time you de&s;ire, then &s;hould I have known what to have done. If yet any will make a more favourable con&s;truction of his words, I &s;hall only &s;ay thus much, I wi&s;h he may find what I have oft times thought on, to be a true &s;aying, <HI>One ounce of reall hone&s;ty and integrity, will turn better to account in all ca&s;es, then a whole pound of Court policy, where mentall re&s;ervations are u&s;ed, by which they will have liberty to make two &s;everall Con&s;tructions.</HI></P>
<P>And for this crying up of magnificency, I know not what to make of it, except there be &s;uch abroad as differ in judgement from &s;ome Athei&s;tical &s;pirits, I have met withal in the parts, where I have been, both of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> who have held, that in &s;o many hundred thou&s;and yeers (I forgot the ju&s;t number, there &s;hal be a Revo|lution of all things, as if I &s;hould be a writing, and you &s;hould be a reading, ju&s;t as we are now, I &s;ay peradventure &s;ome men may be of the mind, the Revolution may come about &s;ooner.</P>
<P>In fine, Let others judge of that Tran&s;action what they will, I am of opinion, that the blood of the men of our Nation which fell that day, will lye (in a &s;peciall man|ner) at the Great Dukes door.</P>
<P>But to the <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> in an&s;wer to my charge of Treachery or Cowardi&s;e, or they know not what them&s;elves, I &s;uppo&s;e the proofs that are herein included will acquit me of the former, and if tho&s;e, (who very well know <HI>I</HI> have complained of them as great failers in &s;ervice) do not acquit me of the latter, let me lye under that indignity. <HI>I</HI> ever counted it one of the unhand&s;ome&s;t things in the world, to be &s;peaking out any thing tending to &s;elf applau&s;e; yet <HI>I</HI> am in a manner con&s;trained to write like &s;uch a one at this time, although my aim is that God alone may have ho|nour by it.</P>
<P>The 29 of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1652 it fell out that more then the &s;even eight parts of our &s;hips Company mutinied
<PB N="25" REF="13">again&s;t me (notwith&s;tanding about midnight be|fore every individuall man in the Ship, who was not wound|ed, gave me his hand to live and dye with me if occa&s;ion were, again&s;t the enemy next day) but then got on their be&s;t cloaths, or one way or another declared them&s;elves, by making the Ship uncapable of &s;teerage, or otherwi&s;e, that they would leave the Ship <HI>Paragon,</HI> and the rich Merchants Ships to be de|&s;troyed; nay, &s;o high was the mutiny, that &s;ome gave out they would de&s;troy my per&s;on, if I would not give them leave to call for quarter, in ca&s;e the enemy had come up a|gaine. And when I had made a &s;peech among them, to en|courage them what in me lay (although now &s;o &s;pent, that it was a very great paine to me to &s;peake &s;o as to be heard twice or thrice my length) notwith&s;tanding &s;ome Comman|ders came after me, where I was heaving over bord the lum|ber our men had got up to cloy our Guns, and told me, I &s;trove again&s;t the &s;treame, and tho&s;e very men that held up their hands before to &s;tand by me, had declared they would call for Quarter among the re&s;t, when ever the Enemy came neere; and upon that &s;core begg'd of me to loo&s;e no more time, but for&s;ake the Ship, and give them leave to fire their Merchants &s;hips with rich Goods, and flye al&s;o: But my an|&s;wer to them was to this effect: As it is &s;aid, was given to Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI> in another ca&s;e, <HI>I will not give you &s;uch leave as you de&s;ire, but if you will begin upon your owne account, doe it;</HI> I can fire our Ship when the Enemy comes within Musket &s;hot. And adding, <HI>Be but patient, and waite upon God a little, and I am per&s;waded God will &s;ave this part of</HI> Englands <HI>&s;trength and wealth, whether men will or no;</HI> and &s;o it &s;ell out through Gods mer|cy in cau&s;ing it to fall flat calme; of which miraculous pre|&s;ervation (if &s;ome Merchants were rightly &s;en&s;ible) they would not murmur, and quarrel, and be ready to &s;peake all manner of evil, whether right or wrong, again&s;t the States faithfull Servants. It's feared, becau&s;e really and truly they are &s;uch, although the pretence be otherwi&s;e, and yet as far peradventure as the former from Chri&s;tianity; Oh the event and &s;ucce&s;&s;e hath not an&s;wered the great de&s;ires of gaine that was on their hearts, being the Goods were left by the way, &amp; not brought through.</P>

<P>But for the Service before mentioned, the Councel of State by Order of Parliament, &s;ent me a Letter of Thanks, wherein they did no more declare how well they re&s;ented my weak endeavours, and how it &s;hould be advantagious to me at my returne (which includes kind Acceptance, the mo&s;t I a|&s;pired after) then I with all reverence and thankfulne&s;&s;e did acknowledge.</P>
<P>But peradventure &s;ome will &s;ay, What need all this di&s;|cour&s;e concerning what pa&s;t in your fir&s;t Engagement?

<P>But naught &s;aith (I &s;hould &s;ay naughty people) he had <HI>Currants,</HI> and I know not what in his Fleet, and for private advantage &s;ake turn'd his back upon the Enemy: The con|trary to that hath been declared to the Committee of the Admiralty, and it can be fully proved that for ought I could know, my lo&s;&s;e in the <HI>Perrigreene</HI> (for want of timely &s;uc|cour) was more then I had in our part of the Fleet, that came away, although the &s;hirt on my back had been priz'd at the highe&s;t value, but if there were &s;ome &s;mall difference, that were a likely matter indeed, &s;ithence that it now appeareth be|fore the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy.

<P>I &s;hall now come to ravell out the later end of the <HI>Re|mon&s;trance</HI> into &s;ome parts, and &s;o an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;aith in one place (that after I was gone for <HI>Porte Ferraro</HI>) I &s;ent him order to ha&s;ten to mee as &s;oone as the <HI>Dutch</HI> weighed Anchor, and upon his life to do it with all diligence; and a little below he &s;aith, without Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> he dur&s;t not act, my order being to the con|trary.</P>

<P>For he that looketh in the Letter, wherein I advis'd him to ha&s;ten after, as for life when as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were com|ing out, that we might not be too much over-pre&s;t before they came for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hall not finde that I there or|der'd him (however) he &s;hould not act any thing without Mr. <HI>Longlands</HI> pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;uch an Order mu&s;t be either before, or after that Letter was &s;ent him; if he &s;aith it were before, then this Letter makes it of none effect; but if he &s;aith it were af|ter, it made the former order null, and void.</P>
<P>Whether it were before or after, certainely no knowing man will imagine, that by my <HI>Letters,</HI> or Orders, I &s;hut out my owne Authority, &s;o as to &s;ay, although I come there my &s;elfe in per&s;on, yet you are to act nothing with|out Ma&s;ter <HI>Longland:</HI> and if this be beleev'd, I would not part with the Command I had over that Squa|dron.</P>
<P>Then thus it will follow: Why did not hee and the re&s;t come out when I &s;ent for them (as it were in per&s;on) by my Lieutenant? And if my former order of ha&s;tning as for life were in his eye, why then did he not ha&s;ten as for life? For if &s;o, in all likelihood we had got together, and obtai|ned the Victory over our Enemies.</P>
<P>If yet he &s;aith, Mr. <HI>Longlands</HI> opinion was to be taken be|fore he &s;tir'd next morning, why did he not conform to his Coun&s;ell (for what ever they &s;ay in their <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI>) it
<PB N="28" REF="15">will be prov'd by what Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> hath wrote to the Councell of State, Committee of the Admiralty, and my &s;elfe about that Bu&s;ine&s;s, is a reall truth.</P>

<P>Truth is, I did write him &s;uch a Letter as he mentions, wherein he was ordered to ha&s;ten after me as for life, in ca&s;e the Enemie came to looke after me in the Sea, and I did it for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>

<P>And &s;econdly, in regard that I had &s;ent &s;ome Propo&s;iti|ons to the great Duke, humbly begging him to endeavour the <HI>Dutch</HI> might comply, and not fight our Ships under his Cannons, but come out to Sea, and do it there.</P>
<P>Now who could imagine, that hee that had made &s;uch a deale of pudder, complaining of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commanders in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> high manner about violating his Port, would not have con&s;trained the <HI>Dutch,</HI> if they would have fought us, to come out and fight at Sea, and upon that &s;core did I verily believe they would have been with me, either at <HI>Porte Fer|raro,</HI> or as &s;oone as ever I came thence; much le&s;&s;e could we imagine, that ever the Duke would turn all the Dutch Captains, and others of that Nation that had affronted him out of Pri&s;on, and unworthily &s;uffered &s;ome of our Ships to be taken within Musket-&s;hot of his Works, and not &s;hoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;hot in our defence.</P>
<P>And it is as true as the former, that after that Letter be|fore mentioned (upon other news I did advi&s;e) that in my

<P>But he addes, the Me&s;&s;enger told him that the <HI>Con&s;tant Warwicke,</HI> and the Fire-&s;hip &s;hould be at the Mould head in the morning to receive him forth: were it not now an ea&s;ie thing to condemn him out of his own mouth, and &s;ay, why went you out of the Mould &s;o &s;oone in the morning (being you went not in the night) &s;ince you had word &s;ent, the
<PB N="30" REF="16"><HI>Con&s;tant Warwicke</HI> and the Fire-&s;hip &s;hould be at the Mould|head to receive you, and in effect intimating, that untill then you were not to come forth: For as &s;oone as they be|gan to loo&s;e Saile in the Mould, I was heard &s;ay, <HI>&s;urely they will not be &s;o mad as to come forth before the Con&s;tant Warwicke and others be neere the Mould-head to receive them.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed; he &s;aith when he fir&s;t engag'd, Cap. <HI>Ba|diley</HI> and his Fleet might have come to us quarter winds, if they would: To that I &s;hall only &s;ay thus much, let me lie under the cen&s;ure and di&s;-reputation about it, if I cannot prove by &s;ome hundred Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>that as the winde gave leave, &s;o we plyed in.</HI></P>
<P>And I make no que&s;tion, but as many Witne&s;&s;es can make it clearly appear, no time was lo&s;t after their coming out of the Mould, but all diligence was u&s;ed to ha&s;ten in to their &s;uccour, and many of the <HI>Parragons</HI> men can averre, they never &s;ee me more earne&s;t then I was at that time, in looking after the Sailes and Steerage, and in labouring a|bout hoy&s;ing the Top-gallant Sailes &s;o long, untill it was fear'd all would have come downe about our eares; and al|ways gave the Ship Brace and Sheat as the wind would give leave, and &s;lackned no other Saile untill we came within &s;hot, and then haled up our Main-&s;aile (as was all the rea|&s;on in the world) being the Cap&s;tain that heaves our tacks aboard in tho&s;e Ships would have hindered the u&s;e of foure Guns, be&s;ides other inconveniences that might have hap|ned.</P>
<P>Next he &s;aith, at la&s;t we came within halfe &s;hot, as if we had lo&s;t time before (an ea&s;ie under&s;tanding can trace the malice that runs through his expre&s;&s;ions) I have given the Councell of State already an Account what I did when I came neere, as that I went directly with the Admirall of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> preparing to grapple with her; but ca&s;ting my eye about, and feeing none of our Frigots had executed my Orders about relieving the <HI>Leopard,</HI> con&s;idering &s;hee was worth three of the Dutch Admirall, I powred about thirty pieces of Ordnance, and a volley of &s;mall &s;hot into her, and &s;tood away for the <HI>Leopard,</HI> with a reall intent to have
<PB N="31" REF="16">gone on Bord tho&s;e were on bord her, but it was judg'd no wi&s;dome to run &s;temlings on bord with all Saile, being a fre&s;h gale of winde when we fir&s;t came neere her: And pa&s;|&s;ing by the <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar</HI> &s;tern within two or three &s;hips lengths from her at mo&s;t; and within halfe Musket-&s;hot of the <HI>Leopards</HI> &s;tern, it may be that is halfe &s;hots length, Cap. <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;peaks of, having di&s;charged fir&s;t a broad &s;ide, and a volley of &s;mall &s;hot, on that &s;hip, and the <HI>Sunne,</HI> in hopes to have cut one Ma&s;t or another by the bord, we made way to flat our Ship round, fully intending to have gone on bord with our fore-&s;aile hal'd up either between the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and the <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar,</HI> (and &s;o &s;hould have been able to have fenc'd on both &s;ides) or el&s;e to have lain along&s;t the <HI>Sunnes</HI> &s;ide, with my Bow-&s;prit over the <HI>Leopards</HI> Poop: but it plea&s;ed God the wind &s;o dullard all on a &s;uddain, that our Ship with as much endeavour as ever was us'd, would not weare nor beare up, &s;o that wee were forc'd to bring our Ship to, and &s;tand further, before we could make her &s;tay; and when we had got her about, we &s;tood away for the <HI>Ju|lius Cae&s;ars</HI> &s;ide again, re&s;olving to get on bord that time; and having pa&s;s'd another broad &s;ide on her about Musket|&s;hot off, the Helm was put a weather to beare up againe, but the Ship we could not make work with that little wind, if a thou&s;and Common-wealths had lain upon it: And the &s;ight of it tran&s;porting me into a pa&s;&s;ion, I call'd to my Lieute|nant to pa&s;&s;e the word among the nimble Ships, that I would have them goe on board the <HI>Leopard,</HI> or tho&s;e Ships on bord her to &s;ee to di&s;-intangle her from tho&s;e Ships: Whereupon having none within call but the <HI>Mary Ro&s;e,</HI> he call'd to her to go on bord; but they being no better man'd excus'd it; thereupon I &s;tept up to look for the <HI>Lewis,</HI> with words in mouth to this effect; <HI>Where is this vapouring fla&s;h</HI> Ell <HI>now, with his forty men, and his</HI> 20. <HI>Guns, or his thirty Guns and his four&s;core men? where is hee? &s;ee if you can make him hear, that we may employ him in this &s;ervice?</HI> but he was gone out of call after his owne inventions.

<PB N="32" REF="17">manag'd no better, I call'd to man the Pinace, and the Lord my great witne&s;&s;e knoweth, with a full re&s;olution to have gone on board her with my boat, when I could not with the &s;hip, verily believing the Captain had been kil'd, and chiefe Officers, and had kept my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But although Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> now &s;aith the two Ships on bord him call'd for quarter, or he knoweth not for what; tho&s;e Ships untill I was gone fir'd five times as many Guns as the <HI>Leopard</HI> did in my &s;ight; for I never &s;aw her &s;hoot but once in halfe an hours time: I &s;ay the with-drawing of the <HI>Leopards</HI> men within doors and hatches, and their not ap|pearing to let goe an Anchor in any time, nor doing any thing el&s;e towards their owne pre&s;ervation, caus'd me to think &s;ome part of the <HI>Leopard</HI> might be in the Enemies po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;o was diverted from going in my Boat.</P>
<P>But Captain <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;aith, his men call'd to the <HI>Con&s;tant Warwicke,</HI> to tell them the Enemies cal'd for Quarter, and therefore they &s;hould forbeare firing on tho&s;e that lay on bord her. As for the Frigots Commander, let him an&s;wer for it, that hee did not acquaint me with what he was in|form'd of from the <HI>Leopard.</HI></P>
<P>But if I had been in Cap. <HI>Appletons</HI> place, and expre&s;t &s;o much as now he doth, truly I &s;hould have fear'd I &s;hould have been accounted one of the greate&s;t Cowards, or fools in the world; for if the men did call for quarter, which I believe is as true, or as fal&s;e as many other things mentio|ned in the Libell, or <HI>Remon&s;trance,</HI> then why did he not call his men upon the Deck to enter them, (at lea&s;t) why did not he him&s;elfe appeare on the Poope, when his Admirall came by, and have told him &s;o much: Or if his with-draw|ing were through feare, why was not &s;ome body el&s;e &s;ent on the Poope to have done it, and have &s;hook his hat, cry|ing <HI>All is ours, all is ours.</HI> I but &s;aith he, to colour the mat|ter, (as if we were all a&s;leep in the Fleet be&s;ides) by a &s;tory he tells in his <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> (in point of truth, like that of 600 Crowns agreed on at a Councell of Warre to be given for his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment) how that 5 of the Enemies &s;hips &s;o gal'd him, that he was not able to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them that cal'd

<P>Next, Cap. <HI>Appleton</HI> magnifies the valour of Cap. <HI>Ell,</HI> and Cap. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> telling how they did a&s;&s;i&s;t, as if no body el&s;e did; and again he declares, Cap. <HI>Ell</HI> did great execution on the Enemy.

<P>Next Cap. <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;aith I cal'd off the <HI>Lewis</HI> and the <HI>Ma|ry</HI> that would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, and &s;et my Main-&s;aile to goe away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Neither was the <HI>Leopard</HI> left in that Ca&s;e (whether &s;unck or afloat we could not tell) in regard mo&s;t of the Com|manders of our nimble Ships had acted quite contrary to order in this (as they did in my la&s;t) engagement, which yet is a &s;ad, and heart-di&s;couraging mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>And although I had of my &s;elfe no inclination to leave the place, as I did, yet when halfe a &s;core of the Chief Offi|cers in the <HI>Paragon</HI> came, and gave me it, as an opinion they would ju&s;tifie upon their lives, &s;aying to this effect: Sir, if now you goe on bord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> and tho&s;e with her, to relieve the former, we cannot &s;ee how it's po&s;&s;ible you can di&s;-intangle your &s;elfe againe before both &s;hips be a&s;hore; be&s;ides &s;aith many, it's very que&s;tionable whether &s;he be not &s;unck already, and ly on the ground. Hence it was, I &s;et my Main-&s;aile, and came away; and if he looks on that, to be the &s;ign of calling off the Fleet, Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> is in the right; but if his meaning be according to the litterall &s;en&s;e of his Expre&s;&s;ions, how that I cal'd to Cap. <HI>Ell</HI> and Captain <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> to come away, when as they were going to relieve the <HI>Leopard,</HI> by &s;ufficient Te&s;timonie, it will be prov'd a mo&s;t fal&s;e thing.</P>
<P>I know not upon what other &s;core the <HI>Machiavelian</HI> poli|cie (except it be to tickle the minds of &s;ome of their Own|ers) they &s;hould appeare again&s;t mee, who before &s;undry upon the <HI>Parragons</HI> decks, and in her Round-hou&s;e, as hath all other Captains &s;aid in our pa&s;&s;age home-ward; in ca&s;e the Admirall had gone on bord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> or tho&s;e Ships lay entangled with her, in all likelihood the whole Fleet except the Frigots (who could have fled) had been lo&s;t: And now we come to the &s;tre&s;&s;e of all, what Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;aith of Cap. <HI>Ell</HI> and Cap. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> and they &s;ay of them&s;elves the <HI>Leopard</HI> had been relieved, but that I hindred them.</P>

<P>I know not what to make of &s;uch impudency and in|&s;olency, I profe&s;&s;e were I in their ca&s;e, my owne Con|&s;cience would tell me, that although other contempts were pardoned, which the Law Martial &s;aith is Death, I de&s;erved the &s;evere&s;t &s;entence for coming &s;hort of my Du|ty, and not complying with the Admirals Order, in point of the <HI>Leopards</HI> reliefe: But a word more.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for Capt. <HI>Ell,</HI> before we came neere the <HI>Leopard,</HI> &s;ee|ing our Rear-Admirall aground, whereas all the Frigots had &s;peciall order to relieve any who were oppre&s;t by the Ene|my, and &s;eeing they did not act accordingly, as I was ha&s;ten|ing in to the <HI>Leopards</HI> reliefe, being he was neere me, either I call'd to him, or did expect although he were of the Rear-Admirals Squadron, he &s;hould follow me, and keep near me in my Weather-quarter, where then he was, his Leader being aground: for knowing that the <HI>Lewis</HI> was almo&s;t double man'd, in proportion to other Merchants Ships, I thought to have her by me to employ upon &s;ome eminent &s;ervice, when as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, but whil'&s;t we were endeavouring to bear up, and goe on board the <HI>Leopard,</HI> he goeth after his owne inventions, &s;o that when our Ship would not work (it being little wind, and our Ship heavy and foule) I bid call to the <HI>Lewis</HI> to bear up, and go on bord the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> and &s;eeing &s;he was gone out of call, and that the <HI>Mary Ro&s;e</HI> had made her excu&s;e for want of men, I confe&s;&s;e I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aying (among&s;t other things in my mind) to this effect, <HI>When &s;uch vapouring Blades are in a Gen|tlewomans Chamber, oh then they are mighty men of valour; but now here is &s;ervice to be done, they can turne &s;hifters above all that ever any Commander in chiefe was troubled withall, before me.</HI> Yet as he lay in my way as we were withdrawing, when we &s;aw it was too late to doe any more then what was done, <HI>I</HI> might bid him follow me.</P>
<P>As for Capt. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> thus, knowing there was &s;uch pittifull Captaines to be employed with me in this &s;ervice, that perad|venture would forget in the morning, what they did over night; I &s;ent a Copy of what was agreed on at our Councel
<PB N="36" REF="19">of War, to Capt. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> wherein among other Orders it was agreed as followes.</P>
<P>If any of the Admirals, Vice-Admirals, or Rear-Admirals Squadron, were laid on bord by the enemy, then &s;uch as were next to them of that Squadron, ought to have laid any &s;uch Ship of the Enemies on bord againe on the other &s;ide.

But I &s;ay, he knows well enough (it's &s;aid being well backt) how to abu&s;e his Com|mander, in hope that (right or wrong) &s;omething may &s;tick to his di&s;paragement.</P>
<P>But in the clo&s;e, Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> declares how the Marriners wre&s;ted his &s;word out of his hand, and put his arm and &s;houl|der out of joynt; whether that were true as that the Ships on bord him cal'd for Quarter, &s;ome of his chief Officers are not able to tel, for though they &s;aw C. <HI>Appleton</HI> the day they were &s;urprized, yet heard nothing of any &s;uch thing, but however it &s;eems he was able to hold it before, then one would think I &s;hould have &s;een it, or him&s;elfe at lea&s;t (in his place) on the Poop, all the time I was neer him, &s;o long together. After that comes in a &s;tory of the Gunners order to blow up the Poop, I am &s;ure his time had been better employed if he had ordered the Gunner to have turned the muzzles of two or
<PB N="37" REF="19">three Guns downe into the Hatchway, and have &s;unk the Ship, which he omitting to doe in time, did very much trou|ble my &s;pirit, and I think may be rank'd among the highe&s;t of his failings: But I think there is too much of that before.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place he tels a long &s;tory of what the Great Duke &s;aid, among others I think it will little advantage him; for is that Expre&s;&s;ion becau&s;e Authority &s;hould be incen&s;ed a|gain&s;t me: Then thus, The Great Duke &s;aid Capt. <HI>Appletons</HI> Crime was unpardonable in that he came not out to my A&s;|&s;i&s;tance in nor after my fir&s;t Engagement; would he there|fore have Authority incens'd again&s;t me meerly upon &s;uch a &s;core?</P>

I &s;uppo&s;e if this &s;tuffe be weighed (in the Ballance of under&s;tanding mens Judgements) it will be found very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e &s;ome Engli&s;h Merchant hath &s;aid &s;undry times upon the place of <HI>Legorn, What Newes from our Rogues at We&s;t|mini&s;ter?</HI> meaning the Parliament (although it's a &s;hame Engli&s;h men &s;hould &s;o &s;peak (was the Parliament ever the wor&s;e for that?

<P>What though the Spectators at <HI>Legorn,</HI> were a thou&s;and <HI>Legorn</HI> Ladies, and as many Fooles and Knaves among them, is that any thing to me? Were they not like a Company that being in a Ladies Chamber near the Sea-coa&s;t, &s;eeing a Ship with &s;ome little wind and &s;ea, to their under&s;tanding, dri|ving into a Bay, and not being able to get off the &s;hore, by weathering one point or other, cut the ma&s;t by the bord, and

<P>But what need I &s;peak &s;o much of them, I wi&s;h there may be none in the world who pretend to better principles, that would not (at lea&s;t in word and thought) condemne and execute before they heare, contrary to the manner of the <HI>Ro|mane Heathens.</HI></P>

<HEAD>&V;pon mature Con&s;ideration, I &s;hall humbly crave leave to adde a &s;hort Breviate or Ab&s;tract of what to my understanding appeareth to be the Cau&s;es of that great Di&s;a&s;ter befell the Squadron neare <HI>Legorn,</HI> the <HI>4</HI> of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t. And I hope what I have to &s;ay, will not be accounted impertinent to the purpo&s;e of clearing up the Truth.</HEAD>
<P>NOt to mention any thing of tho&s;e crying &s;ins w^c^h did not onely make a <HI>Turke,</HI> that being taken with the Excellency of the way of Chri&s;t, and had made &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion of our Religion, for &s;ome Months together abord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> to naucite it, and turne from it (conclu|ding if God were a Holy God, tho&s;e that run into &s;uch E|normities mu&s;t not be his people) which yet doubtle&s;&s;e did provoked God to &s;tretch out his hand again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Nor yet to mention any failing of tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> w^c^h &s;hould have done well to have &s;ent us &s;ome kind of reliefe.</P>
<P>But abroad, by what hath been &s;aid, and is hinted in &s;eve|rall Letters I now pre&s;ent, there may be clearly di&s;cerned a perfect number of particulars, &s;hewing what were the impe|diments to our Conjunction, and con&s;equently where the blame ought to be laid; and if the Con&s;cience of the Remon|&s;tancer, and his A&s;&s;ociates will but &s;peak out, I am a&s;&s;ured they mu&s;t &s;ixe and and annex their Acknowledgement there|unto, as unto a mo&s;t real truth.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;tubborne&s;&s;e of the Commanders of the <HI>Samp|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and the dulne&s;&s;e and backwardne&s;&s;e of the Commander of the Navy Ships to come out to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, upon and after our fir&s;t Engagement, although greatly inci|ted thereunto by other Commanders, that in every re&s;pect were under the &s;ame capacity and obligation with them|&s;elves; and it appeareth by &s;undry Letters from Mr. <HI>Long|land,</HI> Con&s;ul <HI>Read,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wood,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That imprudent act of the Remon&s;trancer, per|form'd
<PB N="41" REF="21">in his owne per&s;on, forcing back a Dutch-man his pri&s;oner from the Great Dukes Centinels hou&s;e, whereunto he had made his e&s;cape, caus'd the Duke to &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger into <HI>England,</HI> which otherwi&s;e had not been &s;ent, as (upon good grounds) Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> advis'd me from time to time, and as was the opinion of the Con&s;ul, and other knowing Merchants, and con&s;equently the di&s;&s;atisfactory An&s;wer he had returned by that Me&s;&s;enger, had not more incens'd him again&s;t us then the naturall genius of Princes towards young Common-wealths would have prompt him unto; &s;o that peradventure, although he lov'd not the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> yet he would not have thru&s;t their Ships into the mouths of their Enemies (upon the matter) as he did afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The not coming of our three Friggots &amp; the <HI>Harry Bonaventure</HI> from <HI>Naples</HI> unto <HI>Porto Longone,</HI> whil'&s;t the Ene|my had no con&s;iderable &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t us, but contrary to Order going back to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and I know not where, &s;pend|a great deale of time, while we might have done our bu&s;ine&s;s with as much &s;ea&s;onablene&s;&s;e as our heart could de&s;ire; and this appeareth by &s;undry Letters.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The exceeding backwardne&s;&s;e and unwilling|ne&s;&s;e of &s;ome of tho&s;e Commanders of Engli&s;h Ships at <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> to embrace the States &s;ervice without &s;uch tearmes as could not be well agreed unto by the States &s;ervants; for thereby &s;uch a needle&s;&s;e di&s;pute aro&s;e, that caus'd &s;o much time to be &s;pent to no purpo&s;e, which (in all probability) had been &s;ufficient to have effected our Conjunction, before the 4 of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t; and this will appear by &s;undry Letters from indifferent per&s;ons that were lookers on, as well as from the States Servants.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The Great Dukes partiality, whether becau&s;e the Dutch were then like to be the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide, or for other rea|&s;ons I know not; but I am &s;ure he dealt very unworthily with the States Servants, in commanding us out the Port, when as the Enemy was near three to one; and after he had made many complaints of the above-mentioned, for viola|ting his Ports, to give the Dutch liberty to a&s;&s;ault our Ships when their &s;ternes were in the <HI>Mould</HI>-head, and although we

<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> The Remon&s;trancers omitting to come out in the night, when as I &s;ent for them in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, wherein &s;ome of tho&s;e that were Pylots, in effect, &s;aid of their Command|ers, They were cur&s;ed becau&s;e they took not hold of that op|portunity; and the omi&s;&s;ion was quite contrary to Capt. <HI>Appletons</HI> promi&s;e, by his Letter to me of the 3, 13 of <HI>March,</HI> for therein in An&s;wer to my former Letter, he would come out in the night, if he had my approbation, and he wanted not that, with expre&s;&s;ions from my Lievtenant, how earne&s;t|ly de&s;irous I was to have had them come away with all &s;peed.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> and la&s;tly, Coming out (contrary to their owne deliberate re&s;ult at a Con&s;ultation) before that I was engag'd with the Enemy; whereas notwith&s;tanding, what|ever he &s;imply in&s;erts concerning my requiring him to ha|&s;ten out to me as for life, three or four dayes before the Di&s;|pute, his Letter of the 3, 13 of <HI>March</HI> tels me he had receiv'd my Letters and Orders dated that morning at four a Clock, if that were produc'd (of which I had no time to take a co|py, or have lo&s;t it) I am confident therein it will be found expre&s;t, I was &s;o far from bidding them ha&s;ten to me as for life, that <HI>per contra,</HI> I de&s;ired he would not &s;tir (meaning in the day time) until he &s;aw me engag'd, and in effect he con|fe&s;&s;eth as much, by &s;aying in the afore-mention'd Letter, that <HI>He thank'd me for my care in not hazzarding that Squadron:</HI> Un|to which I &s;hall adde no more, but that I am,</P>

<P>And ca&s;ting my eye upon it, I find a Declaration from C. <HI>Seaman,</HI> from C. <HI>Ell,</HI> and from Cap. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> which I had ne|ver liberty to &s;ee before, and &s;o it's not po&s;&s;ible for me to give an An&s;wer thereunto at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And although therein I find &s;uch horrid fal&s;ities, as fils me with admiration, in regard &s;uch is their boldne&s;&s;e to doe it, even as we u&s;e to &s;ay, in the very face of Authority, an|nexing, it's <HI>Printed by the Printer to the Parliament of</HI> ENG|LAND.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you give me leave to declare what is on my heart, like as in a ve&s;&s;el that wants vent, and I hope no levity will be found therein.</P>
<P>As the Lord is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed to prevent his by the ble&s;&s;ings of goodne&s;&s;e, &s;o the Remon&s;trancer, and tho&s;e that &s;eem to imbark in the &s;ame cau&s;e with him, &s;uch I heare, as would have been well plea&s;ed with a &s;econd Revolt, I &s;ay they have prevented me, or quite out-&s;tript what I could ima|gine (in point of broaching about their mi&s;chievous &s;lan|ders) &s;o far as the condition of <HI>London</HI> (in the ca&s;e it now &s;tands) is different from the condition of <HI>Oxford,</HI> eight or nine yeares &s;ince.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not yet &s;ay all men are Lyars, or that many have been &s;o, neither &s;hall I yet Query (as one did with his &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> (in another ca&s;e) whether we mu&s;t indeed bow downe to that Image the Enemies of this Common-wealth were deno|minated by a few yeares &s;ince.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I yet conclude they have been happy men to be (at lea&s;t) &s;o wi&s;e, as to &s;tand Newters, &s;uch as have look't on, and &s;aid nothing, whatever they have thought, thereby
<PB N="44" REF="23">e&s;caping many a knock that others have met with, among malicious Anvils.</P>
<P>But this I &s;hall conclude, that as the <HI>people is happy who&s;e God is the Lord,</HI> &s;o that particular per&s;on is happy who&s;e inte|re&s;t lies there: And give me leave to adde, of him that hath truth on his &s;ide, like <HI>Oyle,</HI> it will be uppermo&s;t when all is done, and let men doe what they can.</P>
<P>I have onely one or two particulars humbly to mind you of: in a word,</P>
<P>Whether it would not be be&s;t (for the &s;ifting out of truth) to enquire who&s;e hand is in all this: I do not deny but &s;ome whom I have highly honoured in my heart, may be &s;urpri&s;ed about it; yet I &s;ay the root or &s;pring of all this would be look't into.</P>
<P>In the next place, although I would not exa&s;perate a mat|ter, or hunt after the utmo&s;t &s;everity of Ju&s;tice, but rather &s;eek after lenity and mercy in ca&s;e of acknowledgment: yet in the clo&s;e I &s;hall commend unto your Grave Con&s;iderati|on, what I heard was concluded among &s;ome ancient Com|manders, many years &s;ince: <HI>To &s;uffer an inferiour Officer to be abus'd, is ju&s;t as if a man &s;hould &s;uffer his &s;ervant to take hold of any part of his arme, and that commonly opens a gappe, or proclaimes &s;ome kind of liberty to take hold of his Collar;</HI> or tho&s;e Officers (that although &s;ubordinate) are very neer to him: And further, for that to be &s;uffered, it opens a pa&s;&s;age to the Ma&s;ters throat, which every man knowes is very dangerous.</P>

<P>ALthough I have dome&s;tick &s;orrow in the lo&s;&s;e of my &s;ervant this morning, yet my mind runs on the great danger I apprehend may befall you there, if others be&s;ide your &s;elfe doe not &s;tir, and take it into con&s;ideration. I was once in hope of the going out of Capt. <HI>Appleton,</HI> and &s;ome others with him, that I a&s;&s;ured unto my &s;elfe a defeat of the&s;e &s;hips that lay in this Port, as well as a reliefe, and beating the Enemy thence, which doubtle&s;&s;e upon the &s;ight of the&s;e would gladly have e&s;caped hence; but however it hath been delayed, and let &s;lip &s;o probable an opportunity, Heave to them it concerns to an&s;wer, I wi&s;h they them&s;elves

<PB N="69" REF="37">to a&s;&s;ault them in the Road; the&s;e are &s;ymtomes that the Road is theirs that win it, as I cannot get &s;o much from them in plaine tearms, neither will I per&s;wade you to begin any ho&s;tility in the Road, for I believe you will not want provocation, or at lea&s;t the &s;hips now here before you come in, yet I would not wi&s;h you to de|&s;i&s;t from any notable advantage, upon nicities, when no a&s;&s;urance or certainty can be got from any of the&s;e great Officers. The &s;hips are all ready to undertake any thing that is within the compa&s;&s;e of po&s;&s;ibility, but except part of the Dutch goe out to you, or at lea&s;t your Fleet come in to our &s;uccour, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e &s;hips to get away without great lo&s;&s;e and hazard. The Great Dukes Letter unto you was &s;ent to</HI> Porto Ferraro, <HI>and is thence come back to my hands, which I would have &s;ent you tran&s;lated, if time would permit, but I doubt not but it will be well done, by &s;ome with you. I mu&s;t not omit to tell you, that the Collonel this day told me, if our &s;hips were wor&s;ted in this incounter, and came back thither for a Port, the Frigot mu&s;t then be re&s;tored. The great de&s;igne of the Flemmings is to &s;poyle them &s;hips in the Mould, which I believe is the cau&s;e they will not &s;tir to come out to you.</HI></P>

<P><HI>AT reque&s;t of Capt.</HI> Appleton, Seaman, <HI>and</HI> Mar&s;h, <HI>I entred into Bond to the Dutch Vice-Admirall for</HI> 12000 <HI>Dollars, that in two moneths they &s;hould render them&s;elves Pri&s;oners in Holland, the Dutch having lo&s;t their prattick (by taking a Po|latto which brought &s;ome Wools from</HI> Tunnis) <HI>our Captaines were nece&s;&s;itated to make Purgo in the</HI> Lazareta, <HI>when they came thither: Two dayes &s;ince I went to &s;ee them, and bid them wel|come a&s;hore, but I found &s;uch an encounter from</HI> Seaman, <HI>that in all my life-time I never was halfe &s;o much abu&s;ed, he call'd me all the ba&s;e &s;candalous names he could imagine, took up great &s;tones and flung at me to have brain'd me, and I am confident if he could have come at me had done me &s;ome notable mi&s;chiefe, if not to the lo&s;&s;e of my life.

In conclu&s;ion, when it was nois'd on the <HI>Leopards</HI> upper deck that they would not goe out til morning, I heard one <HI>Wrightington</HI> a Ma&s;ters Mate, or Pylot of the &s;hip, &s;ay the&s;e words in a pa&s;&s;ion, as if he would tear his haire, <HI>The&s;e cur&s;ed men</HI> (meaning the Commanders) <HI>are &s;o bewitched or be&s;otted to this Mould, that they care not for going hence, why cannot we goe having &s;uch a gallant gale of wind, now that the Admirall hath &s;ent for us.</HI></P>

<PB N="79" REF="42">up his Main-&s;ail for half an houre, to have his Guns cleer, when as the Dutch Fleet bore away directly with him, before the Engli&s;h &s;hips came out of the Mould; yet after they came forth, this Deponent further &s;aith, That the Engli&s;h Admi|ral ha&s;tned to meet them, with all the &s;aile he could po&s;&s;i|ble make, and being neer, the wind was very fickle, being &s;ometimes much, and &s;ometimes very little, &s;o that he ve|rily believes tho&s;e on bord the <HI>Parragon</HI> could not work her, being a heavy foule &s;hip, as they de&s;ired to doe.</P>
<P>And further, this Deponent is very confident, That there was never a &s;hip in the Fleete but did as much or more execution on the Enemy, then did the <HI>Lewis</HI> or the <HI>Mary,</HI> after &s;he broke through the Enemy to come to the Engli&s;h Fleet.

<P>THe&s;e are to certifie whom&s;oever it doth concerne, That being Ma&s;ter of the States &s;hip <HI>Parragon,</HI> and on the 4 of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, in the &s;aid Ship near <HI>Legorn,</HI> which place I am very well acquainted with, having u&s;ed it the&s;e twenty years, and upwards. At break of day, find|ing our &s;elves to be &s;omewhat further off then we made account, I am able to te&s;tifie, all &s;aile was made to ply in|to <HI>Legorn</HI>-Road, as po&s;&s;ible could be, until about an houre after, that the Dutch Fleet was come out neer <HI>Mount Ne|gro,</HI> and then their head-mo&s;t &s;hips bearing off directly up|on us, our Main-&s;aile was hail'd up for halfe an houre, as was all the rea&s;on in the world, that we might have no|thing hinder us from plying all our Guns between Decks, that our men might be ready to &s;tand by our great Ord|nance; but as &s;oone as ever our Ships came out of the Mould, all the &s;aile the wind would give leave, was kept
<PB N="81" REF="43">abroad, and the Admiral plyed in with all diligence, and to my knowledge it was fir&s;t declared by him, his re&s;oluti|on was to bord the Dutch Admiral, but coming &s;o neer her as that we could di&s;charge a Volley of &s;mal &s;hot to a|ny purpo&s;e, we did it, together with a broad &s;ide of great Ordnance; and &s;eeing none of our Frigots going on bord to the relief of the <HI>Leopard,</HI> our Captaine &s;eeing &s;o many of the Fleet lo&s;t, judging it the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arie&s;t &s;ervice to re|liefe her, we &s;tood towards that &s;hip, but being the wind was very fre&s;h, it was not held fit we &s;hould run &s;temlings with all our &s;ailes (except the Main-&s;aile, and top-gal|lant &s;ailes, for ends before denoted) however after we had powred a broad &s;ide into the <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar,</HI> and pa&s;t within two or three &s;hips lengths of her &s;terne, great indeavours were u&s;ed to make our &s;hip <HI>Parragon</HI> bear up, that we might come to the other tack, that &s;o we might goe on bord with the more ea&s;e; but it plea&s;ed God the wind dullard all on the &s;udden, &s;o that we could not make our &s;hip work, nor bear up in any time, if all our lives had laine on't, and then bringing our &s;hip to againe, before we could make her &s;tay, we were &s;hot &s;o far, that before po&s;&s;ible we could get a|bord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> &s;he was driven &s;o neer the &s;and of the <HI>Ma|lora,</HI> that it was my opinion humbly given in to the Admi|nal among other Officers, in ca&s;e we &s;hould have further in|deavoured to have gone on bord, it would be almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible ever to di&s;intangle our &s;elves from them againe, un|til we had been upon the afore-mentioned &s;and, the wind being at E.

<P>THe&s;e are to certifie whom&s;oever it doth concerne, That whereas I was a Ma&s;ters-Mate on the States Ship <HI>Par|ragon,</HI> coming near <HI>Legorn</HI>-Road the 4 of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, in the morning, to my knowledge as &s;oon as ever it was known on bord our &s;hip, that the Engli&s;h Squadron were coming out of the Mould, and that it was &s;een the Dutch intended to &s;tand back and meet them, (according to the Admirals Order) we ha&s;tened in to them with all the &s;aile we could make, and never &s;horted &s;aile until either the heads of our Top-ma&s;ts were ready to goe by the board, or that we came neer a clo&s;e Engagement with the Dutch Admiral, and then our Admiral in the hearing of &s;everall of us, at &s;undry times expre&s;t him&s;elfe, that he intended to have gon on bord the Admiral of the Dutch; and after we had di&s;|charged a broad &s;ide, and a volley of &s;mal &s;hot on her, lea|ving her by the Lee, his Boat was then &s;ent to require the Commander of the Fire&s;hip to execute his duty in endea|vouring

<P>I <HI>David Booth,</HI> being a Mate on the <HI>Parragon,</HI> do te&s;tifie, That the 4 of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, from one a clock i'the morn: until it was day (when we &s;eem'd to be neer the Lantern of <HI>Legorn</HI>) God was plea&s;ed to give our &s;hips in the Mould as faire an opportunity for coming out to us, as men could de&s;ire, by a fre&s;h gale of wind at E. N.

<P>And moreover I can te&s;tifie, That as &s;oon as ever the word was given, the &s;hips were coming out of the Mould, we did as much as was po&s;&s;ible for men to do, ha&s;tening in with all the &s;ail we could make, to the hazard of our Ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>And being come neer, I am &s;ure no man could &s;hew more re&s;olution to carry on the work of the day, then our Com|mander &s;hewed, and required all men to fit, for that he in|tended to bord the Dutch Admiral, and when we gave her a broad &s;ide, that had been done, but that we &s;aw the <HI>Leopard</HI> wanted relief, &s;o we went to di&s;entangle the <HI>Leopard,</HI> from tho&s;e Enemies on bord her in the fir&s;t place, and going by tho&s;e &s;hips within Pi&s;tol &s;hot, our &s;hip would not bear up, that the Capt. de&s;ire in going on bord that clu&s;ter of &s;hips, might be effected, if al our lives had lain on't; but if the <HI>Leo|pard</HI> had let goe an Anchor, they might have clear'd them|&s;elves with ea&s;e, yet they did it not, all men were hous'd, not a man to be &s;een on her upper Deck.</P>

<HEAD>The fourteenth Affidavit.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e are to certifie whom&s;oever it doth concerne, That being in the &s;hip <HI>Advance</HI> with Capt. <HI>Badiley,</HI> his Mate in <HI>Anno</HI> 1637. neer <HI>Malta,</HI> being all alone, in the above-men|tioned &s;hip, by his well managing of that bu&s;ines, &s;o were 3 vapouring <HI>Turks</HI> men of War of great force baffled, that they fled from us, and we chas'd after them as long as we had any hopes of fetching them up, although we were all alone, and not above 44 men in us.</P>
<P>And in 1640. I was a Ma&s;ters-Mate on the &s;aid &s;hip with Capt. <HI>Ri: Badiley,</HI> about <HI>Cape Paul,</HI> we were laid abord by 2 <HI>Turks,</HI> men of War, that were Ca&s;tles in compari&s;on to us, and by report had at lea&s;t 500 men to our 44, who entring us, were beat back, where many were forc't to leap over|bord; and although many times we were fired and burnt very much, in &s;everal places, yet God keeping up the re&s;o|lution of both our Commander, and Company, &s;o it was (through Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance) that I believe never any could doe more in a di&s;pute of that nature; the Commander coming to encourage the men, would &s;ay, <HI>Come gallants, let me know how it is with you now, they would cry fore and aft, we want nothing, but a new place in the Enemies &s;ide, to make a new hole in.</HI> In fine, how they were baffled, that ones Fore|ma&s;t and Bow&s;prit was &s;hot by the bord, and the other torne &s;o lamentably, as I believe ever &s;hip was, as not be|ing able to budge or &s;tir. Several men yet living, well
<PB N="91" REF="48">know, who &s;aw many of their great platformes of Ord|nance di&s;-mounted, and not above one man on all their middle Deck, with their Guns, but the greate&s;t part of their men run into the Hold, and the <HI>Turks</HI> can be&s;t of all tell how they felt it.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Anno</HI> 1644, of <HI>Matril</HI> with Capt. <HI>Badiley,</HI> in the &s;aid &s;hip all alone, three <HI>Turkes</HI> men of War came fiercely up with us, as if they would de&s;troy us at once, who could not have le&s;&s;e then 4 or 500 men, to our 44, yet by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance, although our Commander cal'd them abord, they were &s;o di&s;heartened at our fir&s;t broad &s;ide, that like Doggs with their tailes between their leggs, they run away from us, with all the &s;aile they could make, and never &s;hot at us more, for hindring their way.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Parragon</HI> being a Mate and Pylot there, in our En|gagement with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> neer <HI>Cor&s;igo</HI> the 27 and 28 of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> &s;uch was our Commanders re&s;olution in the face of the Enemy, that I am per&s;waded it's impo&s;&s;ible for any man to be more; and after that we had about four&s;core men kil'd and wounded in our &s;hip, and my &s;elfe wounded in three places, &s;o that I was not able to help my &s;elfe, or Com|mander, yet I know whereas he plac't every man anew at his Quarters, and each man over night gave his hand to live and dye with him next day, if occa&s;ion were; howbe|it the 29 day in the morning, about the coming downe of our Main-yard, mo&s;t of the men were &s;o rallyed into a mu|tinous di&s;temper, that they &s;aid, <HI>If the Enemy comes up we &s;hall have no Quarter, let's be gone with the Frigots, another &s;hot &s;hall not be made;</HI> but I &s;uppo&s;e it was occa&s;ioned withall from a report there was of 45 foot water in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>At that time &s;eeing one <HI>Hide</HI> with two or three others &s;tanding in a knot, I &s;aid, <HI>Good Sirs, we that did &s;uch good &s;er|vice ye&s;terday, let's not leave the Commander to day; if this &s;hip, and &s;o great a &s;trength of the Nations be lo&s;t, it would be the great|e&s;t di&s;grace that ever befell our Nation;</HI> he replyed, <HI>Wee'l fight no more, the State hath better &s;hips, but we have no more lives.</HI> Nay to &s;uch a height the mutiny was growne, that I have
<PB N="92" REF="49">heard &s;ome &s;ay, <HI>If the Captaine would not &s;uffer them to call for Quarter, they would &s;towe him well enough,</HI> or words to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And whereas in the la&s;t Engagement neer <HI>Legorn,</HI> I was next &s;ubordinate to <HI>Peter Whyting</HI> in the Fire-&s;hip, called the <HI>Spy,</HI> thus much I did ob&s;erve, That the gale Ea&s;terly of the &s;hore continued all night, and if they in the Mould had come out whil'&s;t God gave them an opportunity by the E|clip&s;e of the Moon, I believe they had not been &s;hot with many &s;hot from the Enemy, who of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t have weather'd, and &s;o have joyned with us very hand&s;omely; and when it was day the Admiral plyed in for the Road, with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, until he came neer within Mu&s;|ket &s;hot of the Dutch Admiral, &amp; that he alter'd his cour&s;e to goe for the <HI>Leopard.</HI> In this interim, I being on bord the Fire&s;hip afor&s;aid, know that our Admiral &s;ends us word to do our execution upon the Dutch Admir. who was brought by the Lee, but I never under&s;tood that he would ever come neerer to us with his owne &s;hip, then he was, and I know not to what purpo&s;e he &s;hould, there being (except the Dutch Admiral) none to hurt us, within &s;hot, that I &s;aw, but tho&s;e on bord the <HI>Leopard,</HI> and to windward we might goe on bord what &s;hip we would, which was our owne, but our Capt. <HI>Whiting</HI> would not let us &s;et our Main-&s;aile to doe the &s;ervice; and when it came to, get into the Boat one of the fir&s;t (as I have heard) &s;haking like an <HI>A&s;phen</HI> leaf, leaving me on bord between drowning and burning, in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition; and I doubt it would go hard with him for his life, if he &s;hould come to be que&s;tio|ned in the bu&s;ines, for &s;o great Cowardi&s;e. </P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have well denoted, I believe the Letter &s;ent his High|ne&s;s, by order from the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> is not only
<PB N="102" REF="54">full of courteous, but reall acknowledgements of the great e&s;teem they have of his Highne&s;s favour, in vouch&s;afing pro|tection for their Ships in this place; and I believe at all times his Highne&s;&s;e may be confident that (in a reciprocal manner) the Engli&s;h Nation will acknowledge the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Councel of State al&s;o hath been pleas'd to &s;ignifie unto me that their plea&s;ure is, Cap. <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;hall returne over land into <HI>England</HI> with all &s;peed, to give an account why he did a&s;&s;ault the great Dukes Centinel, (for, as I alwayes under|&s;tood, that uncivill act caus'd his Highne&s;&s;e to di&s;patch away the Me&s;&s;enger into <HI>England</HI>) and in the next place, I &s;uppo&s;e they will be inform'd from him, how the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot was regain'd; whereupon, if they finde it ju&s;tice, or rea&s;on, doubt|le&s;&s;e they will give immediate order, that the great Duke &s;hall make the Dutch &s;atisfaction in the be&s;t manner he may, and what he doth therein, they will &s;o &s;tand to it, as that his Highne&s;&s;e &s;hall be no &s;ufferer. But now le&s;t Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> &s;hould not arrive in <HI>England</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the ordinary; if it plea&s;e you, I will adde to what I have formerly wrote the Councel of State, &s;uch a full relation about the manner of that Friggots &s;urprizall, as that it mu&s;t give a clear light to the under&s;tanding of that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; and I will pre&s;ume once in 45. or 48. days the great Duke &s;hall have a punctual an&s;wer, &s;o that he will &s;ee what they will do in that matter, which referres to the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot, and &s;o we parted at that time.</P>
<P>About two or three dayes after he &s;ends for me a&s;hor, and I could not deny but attend accordingly: for you mu&s;t note, although this were a Treaty, it was a forc'c one; (on my part) I was con&s;train'd to attend what this Secretary of State would &s;ay to me, and could no more (as I conceive) avoid hearken|ing to what he &s;hould &s;ay, then I could prevent the great Duke from putting one of our Mariners to the Torture (at our enemies in&s;tance.) I know not for what cau&s;e, next to the reverence we did him, and re&s;pective &s;alutes we made him at pa&s;&s;ing by, except it was, becau&s;e he had heard two or three dayes before that the Dutch commanded in our Channel, and were like to be the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>But when Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> and my &s;elf came thither; he
<PB N="103" REF="54">asked us, whether we had thought on what he had before mo|tion'd concerning giving &s;ome &s;atisfaction about the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot?</P>
<P>An&s;wer was made in words, to this effect.</P>
<P>We have wrote by this ordinary expre&s;&s;ely to know what the States plea&s;ure is in that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, doubtle&s;&s;e they will give the great Duke &s;atisfaction about it; He an&s;wered, oh the great Duke would have pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction that he might &s;top the mouthes of the Dutch.</P>
<P>It was replied by us, the Dutch had taken a great parcell of Tinne which belonged to our Nation, out of French ve&s;|&s;els and others, even under the Cannons of his Highne&s;&s;e, im|porting upon the matter as much as the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot was valued at; and be&s;ides, we told him the Dutch them&s;elves bragg'd every day upon the place, that they had taken an Engli&s;h Ship from under the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lant,</HI> and another from under the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Allicant,</HI> and &s;o were made good foure times the value of the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot already; and in our o|pinion it could not but render his Highne&s;&s;e among all Prin|ces to be very partial, if he looked for further &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>In fine, he told us plainly, the great Dukes plea&s;ure was, that one of the States Ships &s;hould be di&s;armed, and have her Rudder and Sailes taken a&s;hore; To that his conclu&s;ion, we made an&s;wer thus: The great Duke is Patron, and he may do what &s;eemes him good; but one day an account mu&s;t be given of the damage that the State of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould re|ceive thereby, or words to that purpo&s;e, and &s;o we were di&s;|mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>About this time one of the great Dukes Subjects Ve&s;&s;els going out of the <HI>Mould</HI> with &s;ome provi&s;ions for our Ships at Port <HI>Ferraro,</HI> as &s;oon as ever &s;he was about the <HI>Mould</HI> head, was chas'd by the Dutch <HI>Tartan,</HI> and without the Ma|&s;ter had cut away his Boat, and bore his quick-&s;ide in the wa|ter, &s;he had been &s;napt; and yet (upon the matter) no no|tice was taken of it.</P>

<P>WHereas it hath been your plea&s;ure to honour me with a credential Letter, bearing date the eighth in&s;tant; foure dayes &s;ince I receiv'd it by the hands of that Right Worthy and Honourable per&s;on, your Secretary of State, from whom I was inform'd of what was his me&s;&s;age from your Highne&s;&s;e, and unto whom I returned &s;uch a mode&s;t, and humble an&s;wer, as I hope hath been &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Among other commands, the Councel of State (ap|pointed by authority from the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI>) hath required me (as well out of re&s;pect of what I oblig'd my &s;elf unto your Highne&s;&s;e for in my former Letters, or humble addre&s;&s;es, as for other ends) in no ca&s;e, nor upon any pre|tence to a&s;&s;ault the Dutch in the Ports, and Chambers of your Highne&s;&s;e, except they fir&s;t began with us the Engli&s;h, which commands, or orders of theirs, according to my duty, I &s;hall readily render obedience unto.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>SO that in ditto Letter I gave his Highne&s;&s;e to under&s;tand, that although I would be very careful to obey the com|mand I had receiv'd from the authorty of <HI>England</HI> not to di|&s;turbe his Port, without the enemie began with us fir&s;t; &s;ince it was very per&s;picuous to every rational man, the Dutch had begun with us, I humbly withdrew my word, and crav'd leave to do what was reciprocall to the actions of the Dutch, whenever a power came into my hands.</P>
<P>Now my rea&s;ons for writing in that manner, were the&s;e briefly.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, whereas (peradventure) the great Duke might think that <HI>England</HI> was lo&s;t, becau&s;e the Dutch commanded in our Channel at the pre&s;ent; yet I judg'd not our Nation in &s;o low a condition, but that I &s;till expected a Fleet of Ships to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance: And it was done that (at lea&s;t) he might be &s;o much amus'd about it, as to believe I had private intel|ligence of &s;ome Friggots that were departed from the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> whom I might expect every moment, and thereby be enabled to de&s;troy them in his Road, who had layen &s;o long at the door, watching for our de&s;truction. In fine hereby I thought the great Duke would be &s;omewhat &s;tartled, and begin to open his ear to what was propounded by me, &s;o ju&s;t and equal, and not appear &s;o partial as he had done all along, &s;ince he heard of &s;ome defeat we had by the Dutch el&s;ewhere.</P>
<PB N="106" REF="56">
<P>Secondly, I did it, that the Dutch (who were like to hear of it immediately) might be in &s;ome mea&s;ure mortified; and for ought I knew in&s;tead of per&s;i&s;ting, to have the Ammuni|tions, Sailes, Rudder, and Ship <HI>Leopard,</HI> or <HI>Bonavanture</HI> to be con&s;ign'd into the hands of the great Duke for their u&s;e, they might be put into &s;ome pannick fear, and have thoughts of removing either to meet their eight &s;hips about the mouth of the Gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> and at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> or el&s;e to go We&s;t|ward about <HI>Telloon</HI> to joyne with five good Ships of Warre they had that way, le&s;t when the &s;trength came out of <HI>Eng|land</HI> that I expected thence, they might be ruin'd where they rode.</P>
<P>The 19th. a returne of that Letter was pre&s;ented me by his Highne&s;&s;e Secretary, who having intimated he was at lei&s;ure, and had &s;omething to declare unto me from his Ma&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Longland,</HI> and my &s;elf waited on him accordingly; but fir&s;t the Letter followeth.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>And when I had read it, he ask'd me why I recall'd my word? It was an&s;wered, the Dutch violated the Port every day, and I hoped the Great Duke would not take it ami&s;&s;e if I could when I had power in my hands de&s;troy them that were not onely originally the di&s;turbers thereof, but per&s;i&s;ted therein from day to day; However, &s;aid I, his Highne&s;&s;e may be confident I &s;hall be at his command, &s;o that I &s;hall not proceed any further (in point of giving any di&s;turbance to his Port) then him&s;elf &s;hall give liberty.</P>
<P>But, &s;aith Ditto Secretary, <HI>What will you do in order to what I spake to you the other day, about Con&s;igning one of the States Ships into the hands of the Great Duke, untill the Duke had &s;atisfaction?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, It is not in my power willingly to deliver up one of the States Ships to the Duke, or any other Prince or State, without &s;pecial order from my Ma&s;ters in <HI>England; Well then,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>His Highne&s;&s;e plea&s;ure is, you &s;hall depart his Port, what &s;ay you to that?</HI> I replyed, that rather then I would willingly give con&s;ent, that any of my Limbs &s;hould be cut off, I would fight for the whole Body as long as I could.</P>
<P>To which he made a further Reply, and &s;aid; <HI>It was the Great Dukes order to tell me, that I mu&s;t depart his Port, or</HI> Mould <HI>with the Engli&s;h Ships of warre, that were there once in ten dayes.</HI></P>
<P>To which I made this mode&s;t Reply, in effect, as I &s;aid before, The Great Duke is Patron, he may do what &s;eemeth
<PB N="108" REF="57">him good, and although he knoweth be&s;t what he hath to do; yet in my opinion to require us to go out into the mouths of our enemies, when as they &s;hall be three to one, would be an Eclip&s;e to his Honour among all the Princes in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and I in&s;tanced unto him the carriage of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> towards Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> having once promi&s;ed him protection in his Port; and proceeding in that di&s;cour&s;e, I told him, that as I was employed under the Generals in a &s;ervice near <HI>Lix.</HI> for the reduction of our revolted Ships, &s;o I was a &s;pectator of what pa&s;t there, and although our General made it his reque&s;t to that King again and again, that a day might be appointed for the forementioned Ships to be commanded forth, that &s;o we might keep the Honour of his Port unviolated, and yet di&s;pute for our own in the Sea; However he would not be prevailed withal about it: For, &s;aid he, it would not &s;tand with his Honour to command &s;uch forth into the enemies hands, when there is oddes, who had craved his protection, and notwith&s;tanding all the time our Ships were under his command, we carried our &s;elves civilly, not &s;earching and plundering the ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and Lording it over all, as the Dutch did in <HI>Legorne</HI> Road; wherefore how can the Great Duke in point of Ho|nour command us forth to gratifie &s;uch in&s;olent enemies as ours were? yet, &s;aid I, the above named practice cannot be commended in the aforementioned King, becau&s;e the Ships we then looked after, were the Common wealths of <HI>England,</HI> paid for with their own money, onely mo&s;t of the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with them, revolted from their due obedience, which alters the ca&s;e between their condition and ours, as much as may be; yet it holds out thus much, that Princes have had much re&s;pect to their Honour, in commanding tho&s;e with whom they are in amity to go from under their protection into the mouthes of their enemies, when they judge them&s;elves in no capacity for an engagement.</P>
<P>To all which di&s;cour&s;e the Secretary an&s;wered; all the fa|vour I could expect was the la&s;t, and the fir&s;t day &s;hould not be reckoned into the number of the 10 days.</P>
<P>And yet once again I replied, &s;ithence the great Duke be|gan
<PB N="109" REF="57">to be aweary of us, and would nece&s;&s;itate us to go forth; I earne&s;tly de&s;ired one thirty, or fourty dayes to gather to|gether our Ships at <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> adding, his Highne&s;&s;e the Great Duke mu&s;t needs be acquainted what a va&s;t ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">age the State of <HI>England</HI> hath been at to impre&s;s &s;hips into their &s;ervice at <HI>Venice,</HI> and el&s;ewhere; and if we be commanded out, and con&s;equently be forc't to engage ere tho&s;e &s;hips can come to joyne, all their charge would be to no purpo&s;e; and I added, that is no &s;mall matter.</P>
<P>For but the other day having occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with the Admirall of the Great Dukes Gallies, he could tell me what &s;hips we had fitting here and there, as well as my &s;elf, and computed our pre&s;ent charge to be (when lea&s;t) an hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and Crownes.</P>
<P>In fine, again and again I am &s;ure more then &frac12;. a dozen times, with all earne&s;tne&s;&s;e I did humbly beg but for thirty or fourty dayes time to get our &s;hips together, and that the di&s;pute about the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot might make no ob&s;truction; the Secretary was proffer'd by Mr. <HI>Longland</HI> at my in&s;tance, as much money as the Friggot &s;hould be judg'd worth, that he might do what he would withall. But &s;eeing all our endea|vours were rendred fruitle&s;&s;e, and that the &s;aid Secretary would harp upon no other &s;tring then what is before de|noted about giving us the fir&s;t and the la&s;t day, I took my leave of him; and con&s;idering how more guns had been late|ly brought down, and planted again&s;t our &s;hips; to what end I could not tell, except it were to further our de&s;truction, if we were not gone at the time &s;et us; and calling to minde how vain a thing it was ever counted to lie in the ditch, and not &s;tirre to get out; I laboured in tho&s;e two or three dayes I remain'd at <HI>Legorn</HI> to put our &s;hips in as good an equipage as I could, and went to Port <HI>Feraro</HI> to fetch up the re&s;t of our &s;trength that was there; and &s;eeing how unready our &s;hips were, and unlikely that even our &s;hips &s;hould get up to <HI>Legorne</HI> to &s;uccour our friends before our &s;et time would be expired: I wrote the Great Duke a few lines, the co|py whereof followeth.</P>

<P><HI>LA&s;t Saturday I receiv'd tho&s;e lines which your Highne&s;&s;e was pleas'd to honour me withall, bearing date the</HI> 28th. <HI>of the la&s;t moneth; and although I heartily wi&s;hed the di&s;pute a|bout the</HI> Phenix <HI>Friggot, might have been ended with the Treaty; yet having by &s;o notable a &s;tratagem regain'd the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, I could no wayes be &s;atisfied, how I could an&s;wer it to tho&s;e that im|pos'd this tru&s;t in me, to part with her again willingly, or any of the States &s;hips for her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And in conclu&s;ion when I &s;aw what was your Highne&s;s plea&s;ure concerning the limitted time for our going forth, I did immedi|ately labour that a very ready compliance might have been given unto on my part, and I hope it &s;hall take effect accordingly; on|ly I humbly beg, that if our &s;hips be not out of</HI> Legorn-Mould <HI>untill the la&s;t day, and then the winde and weather be again&s;t us, it may be look'd upon, (as really it is) a ju&s;t impedi|ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am only in fear, that becau&s;e we cannot ride quietly one dayes time in the Roade of</HI> Legorne, <HI>to take in balla&s;t, &s;ome of our &s;hips may over&s;et, in ca&s;e a gale of winde &s;hould come down upon them before the di&s;pute be over.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Highne&s;&s;e may al&s;o be pleas'd to take notice, whereas by my former Letter of the</HI> 4th. ult. <HI>I humbly di&s;oblig'd my &s;elf from what I had formerly promis'd in reference to the Dutch, and &s;uch as related to them, or at lea&s;t begg'd leave to act in a recipro|call manner, &s;eeing them &s;o exceedingly to domineer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I do a&s;&s;ure your Highne&s;&s;e upon my reputation, it was occa&s;ion'd in regard of the in&s;olency of our enemies, that upon the knowledge thereof, they might be mortified, or curb'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and con&s;equently be brought (by the Treaty) to what is judg'd rea|&s;on: For &s;eeing no other meanes like to prevaile, I conceiv'd by that expre&s;&s;ion they might be ca&s;t into no little fear, thinking we had more force at hand, then they were aware of.</HI></P>

<P><HI>It hath been alwayes clearly my opinion, that if any two per|&s;ons come into a private mans hou&s;e, there to refre&s;h them&s;elves, they ought to be civil in that place, much more in the Chambers of Princes; wherefore (for my own part) according to the com|mands I have receiv'd from my Ma&s;ters in</HI> Engl. <HI>(if the Dutch will agree to conformity, and in a reciprocal maner promi&s;e the &s;ame) I &s;hall render your Highne&s;&s;e all maner of due re&s;pect, and give no kinde of di&s;turbance to your Ports, e&s;pecially in</HI> Legorn-<HI>Road; but as I &s;uppo&s;e, all within the</HI> Malora, <HI>to be your Port, and Chamber; &s;o I &s;hall neither directly, nor indirectly meddle with the enemies of our Nation, nor any that belongs to them; neither &s;hall I at any time, either weigh Anchor from the &s;aid place, to give cha&s;e to any that &s;hall be coming in, or going out, or be di&s;obedient to any of tho&s;e ju&s;t commands your Highne&s;&s;e &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lay upon me, as well by withdrawing out of &s;ight with all the Engli&s;h Fleet, for three or four dayes more or le&s;&s;e, as el&s;e how.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Certain Propo&s;itions &s;ent the great Duke.</HEAD>
<P>IN ca&s;e the Admiral of the Dutch Fleet will oblige him&s;elf, that without mole&s;tation or impediment, I may quietly en|ter into the Road of <HI>Legorn</HI> with the eight &s;hips, and a Pota&s;h that are now with me, and will be ready to &s;et &s;aile once in 48. houres; and &s;hall, as is before denoted, &s;uffer us to ride there untill our other &s;hips come out of the <HI>Mould,</HI> and take in their balla&s;t; Then <HI>per contra</HI> I &s;hall reciprocally become oblig'd, not to mole&s;t the Dutch in any kinde whil'&s;t they are there; and that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e being accompli&s;hed, I &s;hall go without the <HI>Malora</HI> as &s;oon as he plea&s;eth; and be|ing there, &s;hall freely &s;tay until his &s;hips come within Musket-&s;hot of ours, there to fight it out like men, &s;o &s;hall we not be any way in&s;trumentall to di&s;honour, or give any di&s;turbance to the Port of that Prince who hath granted us both refre&s;hing from the fruits of his Countrey.</P>
<P>Secondly, whereas the Dutch did lately give out, that they would fight the Engli&s;h when they were &s;even to &s;even; le&s;t it &s;hould now be objected, if this Squadron and that at <HI>Le|gorn</HI> meets, we &s;hall be too hard for the Dutch, then thus; if it plea&s;eth them to accept of the proportion, there will be granted them to advance, one in every &s;even &s;hips; &s;o that if we be 14, they may be &s;ixteen; and le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ay &s;ome of our &s;hips are bigger then theirs; there will be allow|ed them to advance (when the men are poll'd) one man in

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>My rea&s;ons for writing this Letter, and propounding &s;uch Propo&s;itions, were briefly the&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, I was in very great hopes, that by this means the great Duke, who had expre&s;t him&s;elf in former times with &s;o much bitterne&s;&s;e again&s;t Capt. <HI>Hall,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Appleton,</HI> for di&s;turbing of his Port, as he call'd it, although what they acted was far without &s;hot of his Cannons; (as I have under&s;tood) would now have his ends in keeping of his Port unviolated, &amp; we &s;hould have had our end in like manner by our conju~ction: I was more e&s;pecially per&s;waded of obtaining &s;uch an effect, as is before denoted, con&s;idering that at this time, &s;uch a number of the Captains &amp; others of the Dutch were in his cu&s;tody, for threatning to &s;hoot down his Palace; that rather then <HI>Van Gallen</HI> would have been without their help, he would have agreed to what I had &s;o rea&s;onably propounded; And I am yet apt to believe, the great Duke had never freed the Dutch out of pri&s;on, nor yet have given them liberty to a&s;&s;ault our &s;hips within Musket-&s;hot of his <HI>Mould</HI>-head, without the Golden Pi&s;tols had flowne apace.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="60">
<P>Secondly, Although I had expre&s;t &s;o much before to his Secretary of State, that no pretence might be laid upon me by the great Duke for withdrawing my word, I thought fit to open my &s;elf to him, &s;o freely and fully as I did by the &s;aid Letter, to the end that he might be in a manner con&s;train'd to &s;hew forth the noblene&s;&s;e of his minde; and that reality of affection, which in all his Letters he pro|fe&s;&s;ed to bear unto the Parliament and Republick of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by &s;aying,</P>
<P><HI>My Mini&s;ters have been endeavouring to per&s;wade</HI> Van Gal|len <HI>to &s;igne the Propo&s;itions; but he will not be prevail'd withal, and therefore,</HI> Badiley, <HI>take the thirty or fourty dayes, that the other day you were &s;o earne&s;t with my Secretary for, that &s;o you may meet your</HI> Venice <HI>&s;hips, and come up, or do what el&s;e &s;eem|eth be&s;t for your advantage: Thus &s;hould I have known what to have done.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>IT's well I have this Letter under the great Dukes hand, for otherwi&s;e peradventure more &s;uch confident people then the&s;e who had a hand in that Remon&s;trance of a fight neer <HI>Legorn:</HI> would have outfac'd me, and have indeavoured to make me believe, we might have &s;taid longer in <HI>Legorn,</HI> if we would: It's true, if winds and weather had not given our &s;hips leave to come out as they did, then they might have &s;taid: But if once winde and weather gave leave, they have not liberty to &s;tay an hour above the prefixed time, that I can finde.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e (in the foregoing pa&s;&s;age, which relates to the great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI>) I have made an&s;wer to the &s;ub&s;tance of <HI>Signeor Mantemagni</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s relation, and di&s;covered the falla|ciou&s;ne&s;&s;e that is in divers pa&s;&s;ages thereof, as al&s;o in the copies of the Letters from the afore&s;aid Duke unto my &s;elf, and <HI>per Contra</HI> of mine to his Highne&s;&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<PB N="116" REF="61">
<HEAD>Yet there is one or two fallacious pa&s;&s;ages more that have &s;lipt me, which I mu&s;t needs give an&s;wer to.</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>Pag.</HI> 114. he tells a meer &s;tory, (and you know what that is) &s;aying the in&s;olency of the Dutch, caus'd by the unacquaintedne&s;&s;e of the time of our departure (after we knew it) con&s;train'd the great Duke to put divers of the Dutch Captains and others into pri&s;on: Whereas by &s;ufficient te&s;timony it will be made appear, the Dutch knew of the time when we were to be thru&s;t out of Port &s;ome days before us, and to that purpo&s;e had opportunity of hyring Felucas, and &s;ending them away with Dutch Captains or other Offi|cers in them, this way and that way to call in their &s;hips of &s;trength together; and being an eye-witne&s;&s;e of it my &s;elf, I wondred what was a brewing, until the occa&s;ion thereof was taken away by my being order'd to depart in ten dayes accor|ding to what hath been before &s;ignified.</P>
<P>Whereas it's &s;aid, I might have &s;taid four dayes longer, it hath been &s;ufficiently prov'd by the great Dukes own Letter, and I know not what better proof to make, I could not have &s;taid an hour longer, without winde &amp; weather had hindred.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay I came out by my own election, is a &s;tory of the like nature with the former, and that is &s;ufficiently prov'd by what is before mentioned.</P>
<P>But at length he that hath &s;pread abroad in Print <HI>Signeur Montemagni</HI>'s relation, thinkes he hath &s;truck the naile on the head, &s;aying, we had &s;ufficient advantage again&s;t the enemie, if our fight had been better manag'd.</P>
<P>I would here appeal to all knowing men in the World, whether 'twas not likely to have been better manag'd, if the dealings of the great Duke, and his Mini&s;ters with us had not been like unto &s;uch as had betray'd us by the en&s;uing parti|culars, that may be added to what is before de|noted.</P>
<PB N="117" REF="61">
<P>FIr&s;t, As appeares by my Letters of the 2/21th. of <HI>Mar.</HI> wheras the great Dukes Secretary promis'd the Dutch Captains and others &s;hould not be let out of pri&s;on, unle&s;&s;e their Ad|miral would &s;igne the Propo&s;itions, for keeping the great Dukes Port unviolated; and yet afterwards, when as we were come &s;o neer, that there was no going back. I &s;ay now to let the Dutch out of pri&s;on, and tell us plainly they would a&s;&s;ault us, when our Ships &s;ternes were to the <HI>Mould.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Whereas the great Duke and his Mini&s;ters have many times told me, that if the Dutch at any time &s;hould affront us within reach of his Cannons, all the force they could make, &s;hould be di&s;charg'd upon them; and yet not|with&s;tanding when it came to the point, &s;hould &s;uffer our &s;hips to be &s;urpriz'd within little more then Musket-&s;hot of their workes, and not &s;hoot a &s;hot in their de|fence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, whereas the great Duke wrote me in the clo&s;e of his Letter dated the 9th. of <HI>March,</HI> he hop'd that fair winde and weather would put all our &s;hips out of the <HI>Mould</HI> of <HI>Le|gorn,</HI> that &s;o the di&s;pute about the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot might be over; and yet notwith&s;tanding that his Colonel who com|manded <HI>Legorn,</HI> and all that Sea-coa&s;t (as a &s;ubordinate Mini&s;ter under him) &s;hould give me to under&s;tand the 13th. of <HI>March &s;tilo novo,</HI> that if the Engli&s;h &s;hips of War had any further occa&s;ion of their <HI>Mould</HI> of <HI>Legorn,</HI> the <HI>Phenix</HI> Frig|got mu&s;t be re&s;tored, which was as much to di&s;courage us as po&s;&s;ible could be.</P>
<P><HI>For I would make but this one querie in the clo&s;e of all.</HI></P>
<P>ADmit inferiour Officers &s;hall have liberty to a&s;per&s;e their Commander in chief, (when as he &s;hall think fit to call them off,) becau&s;e of &s;o great a di&s;proportion between the enemies and them&s;elves. as is three or four to one, which was our ca&s;e in <HI>Legorn</HI> Roade.</P>
<P>And although &s;ome peradventure will &s;ay, what although you had as knowing Pilots on board as any were in the Fleet, and
<PB N="118" REF="62">(howbeit) their opinion was if you had engaged any further about the <HI>Leopards</HI> relief, the great &s;hips would be a ground together, and hazard the lo&s;ing of all that way; yet you &s;hould have forc't the doing of what was in your own thoughts, with your &s;word in the faces of them.</P>
<P>Again, admit it be granted a Commander in chief ought to pro&s;ecute the &s;ervice he is upon, although the Com|manders of mo&s;t of the nimble &s;hips &s;hould not act accord|ing to what was required of them, but neglect their duty, &s;o that he &s;eeth he hath little or nothing to tru&s;t to but his own &s;hip; and howbeit the Marriners on board had prov'd formerly like a rotten &s;taffe, which deceives him that leans on it, he ought &s;till to carry on the &s;ervice, above all hope.</P>
<P>Yet when the Commanders of one or both our Friggots, &s;hall tell him their Ma&s;ts were &s;hot through, and like to fall every moment, (as they were) con&s;idering we could not be furni&s;ht in <HI>Legorn</HI> without &s;urrendring the <HI>Phenix</HI> Frig|got; would he not have been reputed as mad a man as any was in the world, to have renewed the engagement at that time?</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;e we could have reliev'd the <HI>Leopard,</HI> and not have been on ground, and brought her off, to be &s;ure by that time, all the Dutch Fleet, twenty and odde &s;aile, that were &s;tanding away to the Southward under our Lee, would have got the weather-gage of us; and if &s;o, I think every one will grant, that although we might have defended our &s;elves, yet it would have been an hundred to one, but on of the Frig|gots maimed Ma&s;ts, or &s;ome others would have gone by the board; and con&s;equently as the winde was, we mu&s;t have gone into the great Dukes <HI>Mould</HI> for a &s;upply; which if we had, we were told beforehand, (notwith&s;tanding the great Dukes Letter) the <HI>Phenix</HI> Friggot mu&s;t be deliver'd.</P>
<P><HI>Now as things &s;tood.</HI></P>
<P>Although it might have been more to the honour of the Nation to &s;ave the <HI>Leopard,</HI> then the <HI>Phenix;</HI> yet in a word,
<PB N="119" REF="62" MS="y">I &s;uppo&s;e it would not be more to the profit of the Nation, if all things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>TO winde up all, when that fallacious Remon&s;trance of a fight neer <HI>Legorn</HI> came to my hand, &s;eeing the great Duke, his Secretary, and I know not whom be&s;ides, (a|mong &s;ome of our Captains intere&s;t) all woven together; I thought of tho&s;e words, a threefold cord is not ea&s;ily broken, how much le&s;&s;e that which may be compared to a &s;evenfold cord, to draw on mi&s;chief (if po&s;&s;ible) on the heads of the States faithful Servants; yet a little skill, where there is hone|&s;ty and integrity, may make it like unto rotten tow; whether it hath or no, I &s;hall not query.</P>
<P>But in my proceeding in this &s;hort di&s;covery of Truth, I &s;hal only &s;ay thus much by expre&s;&s;ing what is before denoted; I have been cautious that none might be offended, except it be &s;uch who&s;e contentious &s;pirits have &s;ufficiently di&s;covered them&s;elves: And although that &s;ome may think Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI>'s words concerning tho&s;e times, are like to prove true in all ages, (He that traceth Truth too neer at the heeles, may chance to have it kick out his teeth;) For my part, I am of another opinion, and do yet hope better of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But as a Gentleman expre&s;t him&s;elf not long &s;ince, upon another occa&s;ion; I am in a land of miracles, meaning in <HI>England;</HI> I was thinking whether it may not be added, are we not in an age of miracles?</P>
<P>That a Commander of a Force havein been &s;ent forth &s;hould be &s;o neglected, and as if he had been &s;ent abroad for d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">, (although I confe&s;&s;e I had better hopes) and be|ing in forreigne parts, &s;hould there conflict with as many hazards and troubles, as almo&s;t was po&s;&s;ible for any
