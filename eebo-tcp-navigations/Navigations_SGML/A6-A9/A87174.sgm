<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOu may well expect that I &s;hould appeare in guilty colours, and even blu&s;h my &s;elf into blood at the thought of my temerity; You may ju&s;tly condemne my pre&s;umption, and reproach my confi|dence, that dur&s;t attempt to dedicate the&s;e recreations to your reading, or think, that Inke and Paper could be a Pre&s;ent that might de&s;erve your acceptance: No, Madam, though it were po&s;&s;ible they could be writ with a quill pluck't from the wing of an Angel, yet could they not de|&s;erve &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing. What then can I hope for, who make my Addre&s;&s;es &s;o poor|ly? Who is there that will not judge me to be &s;o great an offendor, as to have &s;oared above the reach of your pardon, and that you ought to invent new puni&s;hments, if
<PB REF="3">you would have any that might ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ch my crimes. But when I con&s;ider that variety of Ornaments wherewith Nature hath &s;o plentifully enrich't you, that had &s;he made another like you, &s;he had utterly undone the whole race of perfection, &amp; no woman would hereafter have had the pri|viledge to becall'd hand&s;ome; when I con|&s;ider in the &s;hallowne&s;&s;e of my fancy all that is excellent in you, I cannot but think that Charity hath a great &s;hare in your &s;oule, and that you can pardon a per&s;on, who&s;e ambition in &s;ending the&s;e un|refined papers to ki&s;&s;e your faire hands, was not at all to di&s;turbe you in your higher and better imployments, but only that in &s;uch &s;mall things I might explain the greatne&s;&s;e of my Devotion. I confe&s;&s;e that the largene&s;&s;e of gifts are generally powerful in the minds of the Receivers, &amp; can either create merits where there are none, or &s;et a lu&s;ter upon tho&s;e that are but &s;mall: but I know, you have a &s;oul of ano|ther compo&s;ition, and can value the gift by the per&s;on, and not the per&s;on by the
<PB REF="3">gift: and truely 'tis that which renders you mo&s;t like your &s;elfe, and makes you approach neere&s;t to Divinity; For, hea|ven receives a Prayer, or a grain of Incen&s;e, (if free from impurity and hypocri&s;ie) with a greater reli&s;h and re|&s;pect, then if they had &s;acrificed whole <HI>Hecatombs,</HI> or emptied <HI>Arabia</HI> of its Perfumes. I begin therefore to think it a crime of no &s;mall extent, to mi&s;tru&s;t your favour, being I offer this with the &s;ame zeal and reverence, in which a Lover courts his Flame, or a Pilgrim his God. 'Tis true, Madam, when I ca&s;t't my eyes upon you, and &s;urvey'd the height of your merit, and then turn'd them upon my &s;elfe, and beheld the meanne&s;&s;e of my owne, the greatne&s;&s;e of the di&s;proportion made my duty &s;truggle with my re&s;pects, and I doubted, whether I might write or no: But all oppo&s;itions were vain, and quickly vani&s;h'd; for, were my Teeth a row of Thornes, yet my Tongue would through, when it is to make its addre&s;&s;es to &s;uch an Angell as your
<PB REF="4">&s;elfe, who&s;e every look utters Captivity, and can turn Saints to Idolaters.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t took notice of this <HI>Pa|negyrick,</HI> as it appeared in the <HI>French</HI> its naturall Language, and finding the Matter well and orderly di&s;po&s;ed, the Sen&s;e per&s;wa&s;ive and eloquent, the words high and &s;ignificant, I judg'd it worthy to be tran&s;lated for my &s;elfe; but, when I con&s;idered the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the &s;ubject, that it was a <HI>Woman;</HI> and the dignity of the per&s;on, that it was a <HI>Queen,</HI> that had de&s;erved all the&s;e Encomiums, I then began to think, (pardon the expre&s;&s;ion) that it was wor|thy to be tran&s;lated for you: For, Lady, do but &s;trip the great <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> of her Maje&s;ty and manly Vertues, and I'le then &s;ay, I do but pre&s;ent you with tho&s;e graces, which you repre&s;ent, and, like a true Gla&s;&s;e, only &s;hew you what you are.</P>
<P>But, Madam, in the reading of the&s;e my Endeavours, if you finde any thing to be well done, I mu&s;t pay my thanks to you; for, 'tis from your fair eyes that I
<PB REF="4">fetch'd my directions and influence. But, if any thing look with an unplea&s;ant a&s;pect, my unskilfulne&s;&s;e in the language, and the fewne&s;&s;e of my years, being yet arrived but at the age of twenty, may make up, if not a ju&s;t rea&s;on, yet (at lea&s;t) a prevailing excu&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not my ambition, nor was it ever my de&s;ire, to appear in Print, I alwaies judged my &s;elfe then mo&s;t &s;ecure, when mo&s;t private; nor had I now expo&s;ed my thoughts to the publick view, had not the importunity of &s;ome friends, and a de&s;ire to &s;erve you, and your fair &s;ex, (like two per&s;wading Oratours) &s;o wrought upon my re&s;olutions, that they could no longer deny to pay obedience to &s;uch powerfull rea&s;ons. Some per&s;ons there are, who &s;trive to eclip&s;e the glories of Women, and draw a cloud over that flowing lu&s;tre, that alwaies attends their graces; but I have here di&s;covered to the world and them, in the happy exam|ple of this great <HI>Queen,</HI> that Women, as well as Men, have Soules; that may not
<PB REF="5">only be capable of great matters, but can al&s;o enjoy all tho&s;e ornaments, which may make up a ju&s;t accompli&s;hment, and render per&s;ons both happy and admir'd.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, that this Tran&s;lation is exact, nor dare I &s;ay, 'tis acceptable; but, as to that part which belongs to my endeavours, I freely confe&s;&s;e, it is not worth your peru&s;all: Yet, <HI>Fair,</HI> do you but throw your eyes upon it, and it pre&s;ently becomes pretious, and may be fit for the Cabinets of Princes. So the daring <HI>Prometheus,</HI> wrought a Picture out of clay, deform'd and cold in the touch; but it was the fire which he &s;tole from heaven, that added life and motion to that imperfect <HI>Embryo.</HI></P>
<P>But, Madam, being 'tis to you that I write, it might well be expected, that I &s;hould not &s;o much &s;trive, how to tran|&s;late a Panegyrick, as how to compo&s;e one: For, the world might count me an Infidell, one void of the light of Rea&s;on and Nature, if, having &s;o fair an op|portunity as this, pre&s;ented to my accep|tance,
<PB REF="5">I &s;hould not glance upon the en|dowments of your per&s;on; Nay, I &s;hould think it a piece of ju&s;tice, if heaven, be|cau&s;e I would not prai&s;e you when I might, &s;hould &s;trike me dumb, and not let me prai&s;e you when I would.</P>
<P>But, Madam, your commendations are &s;o copious a &s;ubject, that every thought of them, puts my fancy in a Labyrinth, where the greate&s;t of inventions may for ever wander, and yet never finde a thread to procure their liberties. The choice of Wits might here &s;trike &s;aile, and confe&s;&s;e, that &s;ilence is their best Orator; and that a look from your face, can more explain your graces in one minute, then their tongues in a whole age. And there|fore I &s;hall only &s;ay, that heaven hath dealt with you, as the Geographers with the World, which though a va&s;t Body in it &s;elfe, they have contracted into the narrow compa&s;&s;e of a Globe. So, all tho&s;e graces that are &s;cattered about the world, are united in your face; and while I contemplate you, I behold them all.
<PB REF="6">Some Women, like the <HI>Panther,</HI> have fair and well-proportioned bodies, but are fain to ob&s;cure their faces in their &s;ilken clouds, fearing to betray the mi&s;e|rable ruines, either of time or di&s;ea&s;es: Some are like <HI>Ermines,</HI> beautifull in nothing but their skins, and &s;ome are like rough Diamonds, who&s;e out-&s;ides carry no enticeing charmes, but look within, and you'l finde &s;oules full of brightne&s;&s;e and action. But in you, Madam, as &s;o many Lines running to one Center, the&s;e &s;everall graces meet, and frame up an exact Harmony. You &s;hine above others, as a Planet above a private Star: And if there be any yet, who dare over-va|lue the excellency of a Lady, and call her a Star, I'le &s;ay, you are a Con&s;tella|tion: for 'tis but ju&s;tice, that I &s;hould rank you with your de&s;erts; and, as nature, &s;o de&s;cription, might make you exceed.</P>
<P>Perhaps, <HI>Fair,</HI> you may &s;ay, that I flatter. But, Oh! don't brand my in|nocence with &s;o great a &s;in. I confe&s;&s;e, had I &s;aid this to another, I &s;hould have
<PB REF="6">been my owne Judge, and condemned my &s;elfe, as a per&s;on guilty of that crime: Had I told another, that her eyes carried fire enough, to tempt the gods to invent new di&s;gui&s;es, and vi&s;it the earth again. That Lillies and Ro&s;es enjoyed no Whites and Reds, till her Cheeks taught them their complexions, I &s;hould have thought, I lyed; but when I &s;peak the &s;ame things to you, that which before was fal&s;e, is converted into truth, and that which was a &s;in before, is now become piety. And therefore don't think, that I write this out cu&s;tom, but devotion; not as though I u&s;e to &s;peak &s;o, but becau&s;e you u&s;e to be &s;o.</P>
<P>But, Madam, I &s;hall no longer &s;u&s;|pend your judgment, or &s;pin out time and my thoughts in a di&s;cour&s;e, where my re&s;pects may prove as tedious, as your graces are alluring; I fear, le&s;t while I &s;trive to entertain the more plea&s;ing &s;ub|ject, I keep you from the more plea&s;ing matter; for, me-thinks I &s;ee your incli|nation more towards the Author, with a de&s;ire to hear him breathe, where you will
<PB REF="7">finde wit and invention run like para|lells, exact and equall. As for the Lan|guage, &s;o much as refers to the tran&s;la|tion, I re&s;igne it to the ju&s;tne&s;&s;e of your cen&s;ure. My thoughts are yet but Me|teors, and maintain only a flattering and borrowed light; it re&s;ts only in the power of your creating &s;miles, to make them &s;eem reall Stars, and become &s;ix'd. In which ble&s;&s;ing, though I claime nothing, yet I &s;carce doubt an intere&s;t. For it were a crime to think, that a Body, &s;oft and melting, like yours, can be inhabited by a &s;oul of a more &s;tubborn con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If, <HI>Fair,</HI> you will now vouch&s;afe to pardon all tho&s;e defects, which you finde, either in my Pen or my Per&s;on; either in what I write, or what I am, your good|ne&s;&s;e will multiply my debts, and add new chains to tho&s;e fetters, wherein you have &s;o bound me, that &s;ooner can heaven want power to puni&s;h offenders, or your fair face to procure adorers, then I have a Being, and not be,</P>

<P>_WHen I con&s;ider this glo|rious A&s;&s;embly, com|po&s;ed of &s;o many ho|ne&s;t men; when I be|hold the happy pre&s;ence of &s;uch great worthies, illu&s;trious by &s;o many con&s;iderations; and la&s;tly when I ca&s;t my eyes upon this fair and noble Prince&s;&s;e, known
<PB N="2" REF="10">to be the mo&s;t warlike and the mo&s;t generous in the world, who hath fixed her &s;tandards, where&s;oever &s;he directed her de&s;ires; I cannot but conceive, by a faire feeling of vanity, a good pre&s;age of that which I have purpo&s;ed to &s;peak: for &s;uch a value and &s;o great a Genero&s;ity, which in you meete, &s;o happily uni|ted, cannot but in&s;pire me with re|&s;entments, as truly noble as &s;ub|lime.</P>
<P>But when I advance my ambiti|ous eyes, and travelling above this middle Region of the Aire, I lift them up to the firmament, there to contemplate the Sunne; I would &s;ay, when I rai&s;e them up to your Sacred Maje&s;ty, that divine &s;tarre, which there, by its reflection, &s;hoots forth beames &s;o magnificently, and with &s;o great a &s;pendor; I almo&s;t wonder in this dazling, that my repentance don't arre&s;t my de&s;igne,
<PB N="3" REF="10">and that my temerity by being for|ced into &s;ilence finds not out a pu|ni&s;hment for its boldne&s;&s;e. Be not a&s;toni&s;hed, my Lords, at my &s;ur|prize, though I &s;eeme ballanced be|tweene what I ought to &s;ay, and what I ought to doe; and though you &s;ee my cheekes u&s;urped by a redne&s;&s;e, which the acknowledge|ment of my own di&s;ability to enter|taine this A&s;&s;embly, hath invited thither. There is nothing &s;o naturall to men, as to di&s;reli&s;h their fortunes, though it bee in the meane&s;t con|cernments; nor are they le&s;&s;e prone to nouri&s;h a facility to all tho&s;e things which flatter them; and yet they doe not know the di&s;&s;icul|ty then, when the greatne&s;&s;e of the &s;ubject doth oblige them to humble their vanities. You &s;ee an example in my per&s;on: and I ought not to hide from you any of that pompous and divine matter, wherein I had
<PB N="4" REF="11">figured to my &s;elfe this adorable Prince&s;&s;e, the object of our admira|tion, and the &s;ubject of our di&s;|cour&s;e, though I confe&s;&s;e I cannot repre&s;ent her, but in an imperfect Id&euml;a: and therefore it is that at this time con&s;idering the Carriere which I have purpo&s;ed to accompli&s;h, and viewing it in all its apprehen&s;ions, I acknowledge the weakene&s;&s;e of my rea&s;on, that cannot dive into the difficult and counterfeit illu&s;ions of my &s;en&s;es, which, alwaies like to them&s;elves, and alwaies deceivers, have, under vaine apprehen&s;ions, &s;haddowed forth to me their de|lightfull Fables. And truly! con&s;i|der with me that which I can tell you, of a per&s;on who hath no quali|ty but what is divine, and who au|thori&s;eth the di&s;proportion that &s;he meets with among the vanities of Greece, the pride of Rome, and the tran&s;cending truths which wee
<PB N="5" REF="11">&s;ee with our eyes; all that the one and the other, ingenuous to de|ceive, would make us beleeve to be more admir'd and greater in their Hero&iuml;na's, who have drained the mo&s;t delicate Rhetorick, to furni&s;h their Nur&s;lings: 'tis we onely that can make Adorers and Mutes of their Panegyri&s;ts and Oratours, to whom the re&s;pect to &s;o happy a Maje&s;ty, and their inability to ut|ter, what could neither be conceiv'd nor expre&s;t, would equally com|mand a &s;ilence. In re&s;pect of this Lady, the purple of Tyre and Sidon have but a langui&s;hing &s;plendor; and the flowers, the faire&s;t and be&s;t cultivated, which art (to &s;ay truth) did ever produce, have but an earthy &s;mell and feeble charms, &s;ince they cannot, unle&s;&s;e by &s;hamefull Negations, &s;ay any thing of this mi|racle of Nature. And this talkative, I might &s;ay, this proud Eloquence,
<PB N="6" REF="12">which hath formerly gloried to have beene the be&s;tower of Eterni|ty, and the di&s;pen&s;atrice of the de|&s;tiny of Kings, finds her &s;elfe now puni&s;hed with ju&s;tice, to gaze upon a Queen, for whom &s;he cannot find words, which may an&s;wer the dig|nity of the &s;ubject; for whom the worlds brighte&s;t Luminaries, I mean per&s;ons of the greate&s;t quality, have been either obliged to hold their peace, when they would undertake to &s;peake worthily of her, or el&s;e contented with an imperfect Orati|on, and a true acknowledgement, that they can conceive more then they can utter: but yet neither their conceptions nor their imaginations, can, without a manife&s;t in &s;ufficien|cy, &s;ignifie the &s;malle&s;t part of her perfections.</P>
<P>So it is, Great Queene, that unle&s;s you plea&s;e to conde&s;cend, and &s;o

<P>The&s;e are the glorious rea&s;ons, my Lords, which have put me in the way, from which I began to wander, and have throughly con|firm'd me in the de&s;igne which I have taken, to give you a Character of that divine Prince&s;s, who puts a Confidence into all that approach her with feare, confirmes them that tremble in their re&s;pects, and encou|rageth tho&s;e, who&s;e Mode&s;ty per|mits not their eyes to enjoy the free|dome of Nature. Let us draw neere therefore, but let us draw neer with hearts &s;anctified, and with expre&s;|&s;ions not intending &s;o much to be choi&s;e, as purified from all that, which might ecclip&s;e or dimini&s;h the lu&s;tre of a vertue &s;o eminent.

All mouthes have &s;aid it; all tongues have pronounced it; all hearts have agreed to it; and all people have confirmed it: what then is it, that we can produce to enter|taine your eares, which hath not a thou&s;and &amp; a thou&s;and times been &s;poken of that illu&s;trious Monarch, who&s;e actions and invincible cou|rage attracted the admiration of all tho&s;e, who were &s;o happy as to &s;ee him fighting. Neverthele&s;&s;e (by the way) wee may glance upon that, which our Hi&s;tories of France have gloriou&s;ly pre&s;erved: It is recorded that this good King, a little before the pale hand of Death had &s;eized upon his per&s;on, being in&s;pired by
<PB N="11" REF="14">&s;ome prophetick thoughts, told his people that they would be the cau&s;e of his death, being they put too great a confidence and &s;ecurity in his courage; for, they began to judge him immortall, by tho&s;e im|mortall actions which they had &s;eene him performe, and the perils to which with an incredible &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e, hee had expo&s;ed his &s;acred per&s;on. This was a prophe&s;ie in its effects too true, and deplorable to as many as were Chri&s;tians: and without doubt God to cha&s;ti&s;e our pride, and put us in minde of our brittle con&s;titutions, &s;ummoned up to heaven that pure vertue, in the flower of his age, after he had plen|tifully adorned him with ble&s;&s;ings here below, &amp; had made him carry with him, the two glorious and de|&s;erved titles, of a King and Prophet.</P>
<P>But let us travel no farther; let us not touch that Marble and that
<PB N="12" REF="15">Ja&s;par, which have beene fa&s;hioned by the mo&s;t ingenuous workmen of our age; let us re&s;t fati&s;fied that we &s;ee him live in her, who &s;o happily enjoyes his Greatne&s;&s;e; and, if by one excellent name we would eter|nize, and render him the Admirati|on of all the world, let us &s;ay he was the worthy Father of our Queene: But! when I &s;ay he was the father of our Queene, what can be &s;aid that hath not beene already &s;poken, and drawne from him by an infallible con&s;equence? &s;ince it is not po&s;&s;ible, that the incomparable Chri&s;tina, could have a father le&s;&s;e heroique then Gu&s;tavus the Great, or that the Great Gu&s;tavus could have a daughter more excellent then Chri&s;tina. Both of them are the miracles of their Sexes; both, the Terrours of their age; and both the Admiration and delights of their people. But there is this difference
<PB N="13" REF="15">betweene them. That if Gu&s;tavus hath been the Model of the perfecti|ons of Kings, if he alone hath en|gro&s;&s;'t all tho&s;e vertues which the greate&s;t Princes of our age, could have wi&s;h't to have en&s;hrin'd in their owne brea&s;ts; yet Chri&s;tina enjoyes the higher preferment, and hath not only been the Coppy of that King, who&s;e dignity &s;he po&s;&s;e|&s;&s;eth, but la&s;o the illu&s;trious Abridgment of all tho&s;e vertues, that conduce to the accompli&s;h|ment of Kings and Queenes, Sub|jects and Soveraignes. This Throne could not be furni&s;hed with a more emient per&s;on, this faire Scepter could not be managed by more glorious hands, and the&s;e Crownes could not be &s;et upon a head more beautifull and more &s;ufficient; for &s;uch a burden would have oppre&s;&s;'t any per&s;on, that had beene le&s;&s;e re|&s;olv'd, or le&s;&s;e di&s;creet then you.</P>

<P>If I were to make an Oration be|fore a &s;trange Court, or if I were to &s;peake to per&s;ons, who have not

Let us only &s;ay, that &s;he hath a Character of Greatne&s;&s;e and Maie&s;ty &s;tamp't in her forehead, which com|municates it &s;elf to her very pict|tures; and &s;o reflects upon tho&s;e, who regard them, that is imprints in them a Reverence, full of re&s;pect and feare. But it is not only the comeline&s;&s;e of her per&s;on that &s;ets her forth with &s;o much approbation, but al&s;o the Greatne&s;&s;e of her Soule, the Noblene&s;&s;e of her inclinations,
<PB N="16" REF="17">the Genero&s;ity of her heart, and the Sharpne&s;s of her wit. But let us take a view of that which fals into the apprehen&s;ion of our &s;en&s;es: &s;he delivers her&s;elf to all the Amba&s;&s;a|dors that come to her Court in the language of their owne Nation; but with &s;uch a facility, &s;uch an Elo|quence, and &s;uch a grace; that it quickly calls up their admiration. Her knowledg is not limited only to the under&s;tanding of forrein Languages, which &s;he &s;peakes as fluent as her owne, but there is no Science in which &s;he is unlearned. She hath an unalterable Stability in her re&s;olutions, a Faith inviolable to her Allies, and in a word, the whole &s;tock of Royall vertues &s;tand united together in her faire &s;oule. This is &s;he that hath lately cha&s;ed the Imperial Eagles, and defeated &s;o many Armies, to e&s;tabli&s;h that Religion, which tho&s;e furious per|&s;ons
<PB N="17" REF="17">endeavored to &s;uffocate: and this is &s;he that hath given breath to tho&s;e Princes, who had put them&s;elves under her protection; that hath broken the forces, which that proud Family had prepared in Germany; and la&s;tly, that hath re&s;tor'd that Country's liberty, which was &s;o neere threatned with a cruell &s;er|vitude and &s;lavery. Heare me, O Germany; I &s;ay, it is not to any but this ble&s;&s;ed Queene, to whom thou &s;tand'&s;t indebted for all the joyes, and all the delights of thy peace; it is &s;he that hath &s;topped the cour&s;e of thy blood; it is &s;he that hath fil|lited up thy envenomed woundes with her owne royall reliefe, which &s;he never &s;pared when thy &s;afety begg'd it.</P>

And now there cannot be but a great plea&s;ure in the fruits of victory; To be attended by the ble&s;&s;ings of the people, to receive the Homages of Princes re&s;tored to their liberties, and, in a word, to be courted by the acclamations of all Europe, and the whole world: This we have hitherto &s;eene, upon the forceing of Citties, defeating of Armies, &amp; conquering of Crownes. She hath inherited the Realmes and provinces of the Great Gu&s;tavus: &s;he hath enjoyed by a naturall &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, the beauty of his &s;pirit, and the Graces of his body: but above the&s;e qualities of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and hereditary Graces, &s;he hath acqui|red a large addition of her own. She is both mode&s;t and magnanimous,
<PB N="19" REF="18">eloquent and learned, gracious and Maje&s;ticke, her beauty is al&s;o a beauty illu&s;trious and full of &s;plen|dor, a beauty of command, a beauty of action, and (which is more, a beauty couragious and ma&s;culine; but to adde &s;omething that is great|er then all this, it is the beauty of a Prince&s;&s;e. Her proportion is perfect, her Countenance confident, her Decorum lofty and daring, her Eyes &s;hining and full of fire, and all her exteriour parts equall to tho&s;e which painters give to vertue and victory. Al which happy ornaments render her to the view full of Dig|nity, and an Authority no le&s;&s;e a|greeable then comely, which can per&s;wade without &s;peaking, and &s;ubdue &s;oules with lookes. Yet to encrea&s;e your wonder, this body which is &s;o perfect, is inhabited by a &s;pirit that excels it, and which &s;its there, like a faire Intelligence in a
<PB N="20" REF="19">beautifull Planet. She is expert in the Science of Princes, and there|fore in her owne: She is &s;killed in Politicks, and the art Military: &s;he equally enjoyes the knowledge of all tho&s;e things that are &s;uitable and profitable. She is &s;o well read in Hi&s;tory, as well in the one as the other, as well in the Ancient as the Moderne, as well in that of the Church, as that of the World, that &s;he her &s;elf is the very Annales a|bridg'd: and in this &s;he hath out|&s;hone the glory of the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous Conquerours that were as re|nowned by their pennes as their &s;wordes, and who at night compo&s;|ed in their Tents, what&s;oever in the day time they had performed in the field.</P>
<P>But let as pa&s;&s;e-by the&s;e ambigu|ous Elogies and the&s;e equivocal Titles, we have &s;om that are proper and particular. Let us not only &s;ay
<PB N="21" REF="19">that Chri&s;tina is de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings, that Crownes and Scepters have beene for many ages the portion of tho&s;e her Ance&s;tors, who have been en|rowled in the throng of that illu|&s;trious Family; this is a prai&s;e in which &s;he &s;hares with other Princes, and in which other Kings may have a propriety as well as &s;he. There is none but would perceive a vanity in &s;uch &s;trange commendations. Let us not &s;eeke any thing of that na|ture for our Queene, who hath them as her proper and naturall en|dowments: let us not throw away our prai&s;es upon gla&s;&s;e and a coun|terfeit brightne&s;&s;e, where we can entertaine our eyes with &s;o many Diamonds and &s;o much lu&s;tre. Let us rather &s;ay that &s;he hath a heart more high, a &s;oul more Royal, and a Rea&s;on more &s;overaigne, then all tho&s;e Kings and Queenes, from
<PB N="22" REF="20">whom &s;he drawes the greatne&s;&s;e of her Original. Let us not e&s;teeme of that beauty, which is as well com|mon to the Poppy as the Ro&s;e, as well to the unruly as the cha&s;t, as well to the luxurious as the mode&s;t; but of that, which is vertuous and well di&s;ciplin'd, of a good report and a faire example. Let us not prai&s;e her Graces, nor her Judg|ment; but let us extoll the mode&s;ty and continency of her Graces; let us commend the greatne&s;&s;e and equality of her Judgment. Let us not &s;peake of her Liberalities, &s;ince there be per&s;ons both liberall and unju&s;t together; or el&s;e let us &s;ay that they are in her choi&s;e, and done with method. In fine, let us admire the veneration, which &s;he continually hath for all per&s;ons, that have made any progre&s;&s;e in know|ledge or vertue: witne&s;s, tho&s;e harmle&s;&s;e Intelligencers, which &s;he
<PB N="23" REF="20">hath in all places of the world, to take notice of tho&s;e, who are en|riched with any extraordinary me|rit: the&s;e are they whom &s;he truly lookes upon, as &s;ubjects worthy her Liberality: and I am &s;ure there was never any per&s;on that did not re|&s;pect her as much, as if &s;he had beene his lawfull Queene: Al&s;o the Mu&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the French lauguage, have not beene wanting to extoll the greatne&s;&s;e of that ver|tue, which hath &s;o well rewarded them; And certainly they would be very ingratefull, if they &s;hould not commend, or if they &s;hould deny &s;uch iu&s;t acknowledgments to her, who is &s;o favourable to them, and who hath prevented their wants, by a &s;upply from her owne benefits: This Prince&s;&s;e is the cau&s;e why they are altogether &s;o triumphant, for &s;he entertaines them as her familiars and companions, &s;he &s;ports with
<PB N="24" REF="21">them in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, but the pa&s;time never concludes without &s;ome pre&s;ent, which produceth a &s;moothne&s;&s;e in their periods, and puts life into their &s;tanza's,</P>
<P>But let us traver&s;e her Royall vertues only, &amp; &s;eeke tho&s;e which altogether compo&s;e the Abridg|ment, and frame up the Idea of an accompli&s;h't Queene: for we would not have our Rea&s;on &s;ticke in one place, or imploy all its endeavours about one thing, where &s;he may elect &s;o many, that are equally wor|thy to be cho&s;en. It is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould prai&s;e all the ver|tues of our Prince&s;&s;e in &s;ingulars, becau&s;e our eyes cannot &s;o well di&s;tingui&s;h them among &s;o great a multitude. But &s;he hath &s;ome that are re&s;erv'd and particular, which are therefore the more con&s;iderable, becau&s;e they are le&s;&s;e common, and becau&s;e they are &s;uch that when we
<PB N="25" REF="21">once know them, our eyes are too feeble to looke upon them with a fix't a&s;pect, or to &s;ee them in all their dimen&s;ions there are con|&s;tantly &s;ome of divers orders and divers degrees, &s;ome of all Sexes, as well as of all Ages, of all conditions and of all times, of Maje&s;ty and hu|mility, and la&s;tly, the ornaments both of Princes and &s;ubjects. The&s;e which are of the latter and nobler ranke di&s;per&s;e their ble&s;&s;ings about the Nation, and are of foure &s;ortes; Ju&s;tice, Prudence, true-Glory, and Piety: The&s;e are the foure wheels that guide the revolutions of Em|pires, and con&s;titute the de&s;tiny of Monarchies. The fir&s;t maintaines peace in the Nation, renders to every one his owne, and &s;ecures the poore from oppre&s;&s;ion. The &s;econd dives into, and di&s;&s;ipates the Coun|&s;els of enemies, prepares them for ruine, and a&s;&s;ures a quietne&s;&s;e in the
<PB N="26" REF="22">State, as well by the &s;trength of the mind as the courage of the hand. The third drawes a reputation from all things. And the la&s;t crowns the endeavours of all the re&s;t. Our Queene enjoyes them all, but not after that rate, as they are po&s;&s;e&s;s't by the world's greate&s;t Princes, who pre&s;erve them only as &s;ervants to their pa&s;&s;ions; They make their Cruelty to pa&s;&s;e currently for the effects of Ju&s;tice; they imagine their breach of faith and &s;ubtilties, to be a weighty argument of Pru|dence; their pride and di&s;daine, to be the materials of a true Glory; and la&s;tly, their infamous Super&s;ti|tion and &s;hamefull Idolatry, to con|&s;titute the exacte&s;t and be&s;t ordered Piety. But our Chri&s;tina is ignorant of the&s;e adulterate vertues, and counterfeit vices: Di&s;gui&s;e and Di&s;&s;imulation are the two evils which &s;he principally hates and
<PB N="27" REF="22">derides: and yet when tho&s;e appeare in another, &s;he hath &s;o great a reach that &s;he can unvaile and unma&s;ke their darkne&s;&s;e. In this manner &s;he hath reclaimed tho&s;e faire, though &s;tragling vertues, which had beene long bani&s;h't from the Courts of Kings and Princes, and which at la&s;t have attain'd an A&s;ylum, under the protection of this adorable Queene, who hath extended her welcomes to relieve tho&s;e amiable pro&s;trates. This is &s;he who is the true Pole of the Chri&s;tian world, whereon the whole Catalogue of beauties are di&s;played; it is &s;he that hath &s;uch an attractive vertue, as can allure to her obedience, the mo&s;t &s;tubborne and rebellious &s;oules, if they be but once touch't with that divine Load &s;tone.</P>
<P>That Ju&s;tice which is only morall, is (to &s;ay truth) nothing el&s;e but an authoriz'd opinion; it is a cruell and
<PB N="28" REF="23">unmercifull Tradition; it is a lawful offendor and in the &s;crupulous ob|&s;ervation of Mine and Thine, &s;uf|fers with unrelenting thoughts the deare&s;t per&s;ons to be de&s;pi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d and ruin'd. But that of our Queene is of another con&s;titution it is an up|right, an all-&s;eeing, and a gentle Ju&s;tice, but yet a Ju&s;tice that was alwayes ab&s;olutely perfect. And we can re&s;olutely &s;ay, &s;he is &s;o ju&s;t as to &s;hake off all her choice&s;t Inclinati|ons, rather then to doe the lea&s;t wrong to the meane&s;t of her Sub|jects: and if this vertue which is the foundation of all the re&s;t, findes at any time any re&s;i&s;tance to hinder the carrying on of its re&s;olutions, it is only her Clemency, that enclines her pardon to reach &s;ome notorious Malefactor. In a word, all her acti|ons are &s;o curiou&s;ly cemented to the high &s;everity of Ju&s;tice, and the calme &s;weetne&s;&s;e of Mercy, that a
<PB N="29" REF="23">thou&s;and happy re&s;ults &s;pring from the&s;e two Vertues, and make her equally feared and loved by her people.</P>
<P>That prudence which the world breathes, and the Kings of the earth put in practice, is u&s;ually no other then an in&s;tructed and di&s;ciplin'd Malice; it is nothing but a vertue tempered with flegme, and managed with artificiall motions. But that of Chri&s;tina is &s;o purified as well with|in as without, that it expels all Forgery and Deceit, and knowes not what is mean't by being capti|ous or doubleminded: One may relye upon her word with more a&s;&s;urance then upon the oathes of others Her Lights cannot be fal&s;e, being derived from &s;o much Noble|ne&s;s, and an Originall &s;o pure and cleare: they cannot be erronious, being &s;prung from &s;o much Ju&s;tice, and aiming at a conclu&s;ion &s;o right

She with her owne per&s;on is a&s;&s;i&s;ting to all her Councels, &s;he is throughly in&s;truct|ed in all her affaires, and under|&s;tands them &s;o admirably, that there is not a per&s;on can taxe her proceed|ings; nor can any one reproach her, that by any neglect or &s;lackne&s;&s;e &s;he hath with-held any thing for ba&s;e ends, or that &s;he ever &s;ought to &s;ecure her actions by an artificiall prudence. And though &s;he alone &s;upports the burden of her e&s;tate, yet her ingenuity is &s;o quick and piercing, that &s;he is not at all en|tangled in the greatne&s;&s;e of her im|ployments: her va&s;t Genius, which might governe the whole world, and her able Prudence to which all the kings of the earth might confi|dently and with great a&s;&s;urance, deliver up the conduct of their whole E&s;tates, findes not any thing in the largne&s;&s;e of her dominions,
<PB N="31" REF="24">that can be altogether her imploy|ment. What is there then that can be compared to the &s;ituation of a &s;oule, and the ability of a wit, that can dive into the bottom of all things: for prudence hath given her a looke beyond others, hath fix't her in a &s;eate that over-awes fortune, and is of &s;uch force that we may well &s;ay Agamemnon had rea&s;on in his ordinary wi&s;hes, to de&s;ire rather ten men as circum&s;pect as Ne&s;tor, then as valiant as Achilles: for in effect that petty Prince of a poore Iland, having attaine'd the favour and guifts of the prudent Minerva, was the principall author of the &s;urprizing one of the grea|te&s;t Citties, that the world ever knew.</P>
<P>The love of glory &s;uites well with tho&s;e vertues, which are in heroique per&s;ons; it breathes &s;pirit into their actions, and &s;purs them forward to
<PB N="32" REF="25">performe great things, for no other con&s;ideration, then, That they doe them. This is that only vertue which is not at all mercenary, and &s;cornes to demand any thing for recompence of &s;ervice done to the Republick, unle&s;&s;e, the glory to have &s;erved her freely and without reward. Tho&s;e glorious Romans, whom Hi&s;tory makes us (as'twere) to &s;ee to this day, were all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this humour, when they enter|priz'd tho&s;e famous actions, of which yet the very memory af|frights us. They would attempt &amp; bring to pa&s;&s;e, things that were ap|parently impo&s;&s;ible, and who&s;e only mention would &s;trike terrour into the greate&s;t Princes of our age. Ancient men would appeare in the Armies, they'd &s;eeke out a multi|tude of Combats, &s;o to draw on the occa&s;ion of a battel, and, among a thou&s;and dangers, they'd &s;till labour
<PB N="33" REF="25">how to be imploy'd in the grea|te&s;t.</P>
<P>But why doe you thinke they hunted after &s;o many perils and Combats? would you have me tell you the rea&s;on? It was to obtaine a Triumph, to behold their Statues fix't in the publick view, and to purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a new and honourable Name. But yet this Statue &s;erved for no more then an unprofitable Marble, and this name augmented not their fortunes, but only in the addition of three or four Syllables. After the &s;ame manner were tho&s;e Recompences that were be&s;towed upon the Illyrians, Mace|donians, Numantines, Achaians, Africans, and many others, who for the&s;e things only, have willingly beene prodigall, both of their paines and blood, to promote the credit of their Countries. But our Queene li|mits her glory by a conclu&s;ion farre
<PB N="34" REF="26">more illu&s;trious: Vanity &s;wels not her &s;oule; but Genero&s;ity only, makes her the performer of &s;o many noble actions: It is not at all to get a fre&s;h addition of Titles, or procure her &s;elf a new name, for &s;he can not pitch upon a choice more faire or more famous then her owne; but it is for the only reputation, To have done nobly: There never ap|pear'd a glory comparable to her's. The envious and the mi&s;tru&s;tfull would make us beleeve that the Graces could not well be linkt with the Vertues, and that the faire and the knowing, prov'd very &s;eldome to be the cha&s;te and the mode&s;t. But &s;he hath given the lye to tho&s;e mu|tinous and &s;u&s;pitious per&s;ons; and tho&s;e who have talked much of Elizabeth of England, Marguerite of France, Eleanor of Spaine, Bea|trice of Portugal, have not adven|tur'd to compare them to &s;o cleare
<PB N="35" REF="26">a reputation. Vertues u&s;'d in their Mediocrity, are u&s;ually the &s;ubjects of Envy: men impute crimes to them, of which they are altogether Innocent, or at lea&s;t &s;lenderly culpable: the &s;malle&s;t blemi&s;h, and the &s;malle&s;t irregularity, doth ordi|narily procure &s;ome advantagious colour for a reproach. But! that of Chri&s;tina is of another degree, and of another compo&s;ition; &s;he &s;its en|thron'd above the reach of Calum|ny, in a word &s;he is all cele&s;tiall, all pure, and all divine. Who can then find fault with her, who is more illu&s;trious then Augu&s;tus or Livy, more wi&s;e then Cornelia, more faire then Helen or Cleopatra, and in fine, more cha&s;t and more pure, then all the Sybils of Greece, or the Ve&s;tals of Rome. She hath in her &s;elf the true re&s;emblance of Zenobia, Eu|doxia, Amalazonta, and all tho&s;e things, that even to the&s;e happy
<PB N="36" REF="27">dayes the world hath &s;eene to pro|ceed from the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and greate&s;t Hero's.</P>
<P>But let us di&s;cour&s;e a while of that raigning and Victorious piety, and of that Chri&s;tian devotion, which the faire name of Chri&s;tina defines &s;o perfectly. Tis without doubt a proud and profane piety, which the great ones practi&s;e; they make it only &s;erve their affaires, and u&s;e it no farther then their intere&s;t ob|liegeth them. But Her's beares no likene&s;&s;e to the&s;e ordinary pieties, nor to tho&s;e devotions which are only for &s;how, and con&s;i&s;t altoge|ther in appearance: Her's are of a higher elevation, and warm'd by a zeale, much differing from tho&s;e, who limit their meditations to a &s;eeming mode&s;ty, and &s;ignify them in three or four teares, &s;queez'd from their eyes by force. Her Reli|gion is not a preci&s;e, nor conceited
<PB N="37" REF="27">Religion, it is neither &s;crupulous nor profane. But farre otherwi&s;e is that of tho&s;e artificiall and di&s;gui&s;ed penitents, who compo&s;e their moti|ons, and proportion their Ge&s;tures, to the eyes and ob&s;ervation of o|thers, who have their Countenances mu&s;ing, their faces moi&s;t with teares, and pray only becau&s;e it is a cu&s;tome; and in fine, who mock them&s;elves in private, for that which they had done in publike, and laugh at tho&s;e per&s;ons in their Clo|&s;ets, before whom they had play'd the Counterfeits in the Church. But Chri&s;tina, totally aver&s;e from this Hypocri&s;y, drawes from the bot|tom of her heart, the fire, the In|cen&s;e, and the victime of tho&s;e &s;acri|fices, which &s;he offers: and, which is more agreeable to the Infinite Maie&s;ty, then all the Gummes of the earth and &s;ea, and which plea|&s;eth his palate more, then the fat
<PB N="38" REF="28">and blood of murd'red flocks; &s;he alwayes pre&s;ents him with the con|trition of a heart that is &s;overaigne, with the humility of a head that is crowned, with thoughts humble and full of wor&s;hip, and with an Authority, not only &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive but al&s;o religious. Her goodne&s;&s;e yet pa&s;&s;eth farther, and her aime is much more excellent then report pro|claimes it; her care and endeavours move &s;trongly for the propagation of the faith, for the defence of God's name, for the &s;urety of his people, for the peace and quietne&s;&s;e of her e&s;tate, and for the tranquillity of the whole Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o &s;ay that this is the common good of her Realms, that it is her piety, which is the Tutre&s;&s;e of her dignities, the Directre&s;&s;e of her actions, and the Over&s;eer of her policies. It is this, from who&s;e advice, all her vertues of warre and
<PB N="39" REF="28">peace, as well the rumultuary as the pacificke, as well the outragious as the calme, receive their directions and conduct; and in a word, this is that vertue to which our Prince&s;s is &s;o much devoted, that we may call it her commanding vertue. Is it not this piety, and this love of God, O you Swedes, that hath chained For|tune to your party, when the death of your late king, &s;eemed to &s;et her at liberty? Is it not this that hath e&s;tabli&s;hed your reputation, which was very likely to follow the recoile of that wavering Godde&s;&s;e? Was it not &s;he that crowned the a&s;hes of that good Prince, who led victory to his funeralls, who gave re&s;olution and courage to the fainting Swedes, and who made them looke upon their enemies with couragious and terrible teares, and fight with a &s;adne&s;&s;e re&s;olute and triumphant, in a time when the mi&s;erable a|&s;&s;aults
<PB N="40" REF="29">of a matchle&s;&s;e &s;orrow, did &s;carce give her eye the power to di&s;tingui&s;h her owne party.</P>
<P>O with what a&s;toni&s;hment and ad|miration together, did the wi&s;e&s;t of the earth, and the mo&s;t &s;harp witted of that age, looke upon this mar|vellous Spectacle, when they began to examine, whether their prudence could have beene &s;o capable, and whether their imginations could have mounted &s;o high! when, I &s;ay, they con&s;idered a young Queene, &s;trugling all alone again&s;t &s;o great and dangerous a tempe&s;t; when they &s;aw how &s;he had overthrowne her enemies, as young and tender as &s;he was. She made a &s;ure conque&s;t, and brought all things to a faire i&s;|&s;ue, after an infinite number of vict|ories and Combats. Thus after the revolution of many yeares, &s;he re|turned &s;afe to her harbours in &s;pight of wind and &s;eas, loaded with the
<PB N="41" REF="29">Colours and En&s;ignes of the con|quered, &s;tuff't with their pillage, and adorn'd with a thou&s;and other markes of victory. God relieves tho&s;e that are his, he di&s;tributes his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e that feare him, and he hath made us all &s;ee in this example, tho&s;e illu&s;trious markes of his goodne&s;&s;e, which he hath al|wayes communicated to tho&s;e crea|tures, in whom he findes the true Symptoms of a &s;incere piety and a reall devotion. O who of our po&s;terity will beleeve, that in our time there &s;hould be a Queene, &s;uch a one as the great Solomon could never find in his? who will thinke, that he could breath out his wi&s;hes and de&s;criptions for a woman, and yet we to enjoy his de&s;ires, and her! Solomon that pompous and magni|ficent king, did never, in all his glory, &s;ee any thing like to our Queene: and he is obliged to con|tent
<PB N="42" REF="30">him&s;elf, to have drawne twenty &s;ix ages pa&s;&s;'t, a faire picture, or ra|ther a faire imperfection of her, &s;ince that all that he hath &s;aid in his time of a powerfull woman, was not ac|compli&s;h't but in ours. Behold here then this renowned Queen, whom po&s;terity though never &s;o indulgent to antiquity, will &s;carce ever take the paines to beleeve; but &s;hee will &s;tagger in her faith, when &s;he under|&s;tands, that her very infancy had the prudence of old men, the ju&s;tice of the mo&s;t ju&s;t, the glory of &s;oules advanc't, and the piety of Soules &s;anctified; Will &s;he not rather be|leeve, judging by the actions of her life, which appeare like &s;o many prodigies, that &s;hee came into the world, high, great, faire, and rea|dy armed, as once Poeticall inventi|ons faigned of the wi&s;e <HI>Minerva?</HI> That <HI>Alexander,</HI> who is knowne by the name of Great, findes much in|credulity
<PB N="43" REF="30">among us, when we read the Hi&s;tory of his life; how at the age of nineteen yeares being then an Orphan, hee by his pro&s;perous valour overcame all difficulties, and &s;catter'd all tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, that had interpos'd and hindered him, from a&s;cending the throne of his Father; and how at tho&s;e youth|full yeares, he a&s;&s;ured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his tottering e&s;tate, &s;o devided at home, and in confu&s;ion with his Neighbours. But what will po&s;te|rity &s;ay, when in a &s;ex le&s;&s;e vigo|rous by nature, and in an age le&s;&s;e advanc't by time, &s;he &s;hall &s;ee that which &s;urpa&s;&s;eth tho&s;e won|ders, which &s;prang up in the raign of <HI>Alexander.</HI> If the fir&s;t found the&s;e divi&s;ions at home; <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> findes her &s;elfe grapling with one of the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant families of Europe: If <HI>Alexander</HI> encountred many dif|ficulties,
<PB N="44" REF="31">to e&s;tabli&s;h his dignity, <HI>Chri&s;tiana</HI> hath beheld her &s;elfe em|barked in a holy, yet a bloody, War, as &s;oon as ever &s;he attain'd the Throne: The fir&s;t had nothing to do, but to quell Mutinies; but <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> was entangled in heredi|tary broiles.</P>
<P>Magnificence is yet a vertue of the greate&s;t Souls, and the high|e&s;t fortunes, and is not bani&s;h'd from her Court: There one &s;ees nothing, but co&s;tly Fea&s;ts, one &s;ees nothing there, but innocent Re|creations and &s;pirituall Plea&s;ures; and if any one de&s;ires a liberality that &s;hould be pompous and he|roick, all the world knowes, and many by their own experience can te&s;tifie, that this great Queen de|livers out her bounties &s;o freely, as if God had e&s;tabli&s;h'd her in his room, to deal out his ble&s;&s;ings, and enrich tho&s;e that are his. She doth
<PB N="45" REF="31">not onely extend her charity to tho&s;e that ask it, but to tho&s;e al&s;o, who neither pretend nor expect any thing: &s;he gives much, and de|layes not; &s;he gives cheerfully, and repents not; and, in fine, Liberali|ty is a vertue, which &s;he practi&s;eth after &s;o noble and generous a man|ner, that &s;he &s;tretcheth it &s;o far, as it may be called liberality; and &s;he cannot extend it farther, without making it cea&s;e to be a vertue. She doth not at all counterfeit the li|berall or the magnificent, for it would be a hard matter for her, to keep her &s;elfe from not being &s;o: Therefore &s;he need not &s;truggle for a di&s;gui&s;e, or labour to &s;eem that which &s;he is. While &s;he permits her &s;elfe to follow the &s;treame of her own inclinations, &s;he can never fall into any thing, but what is ju&s;t and vertuous; and therefore her good actions flowing from their Origi|nall,

And truly we may &s;ay, that it is only the di&s;cretion of tho&s;e, to whom &s;he di&s;tributes her bene|fits, that can put a &s;top to her mag|nificence.</P>

I had al&s;o beene in doubt whether I &s;hould have obeyed my fir&s;t re&s;olutions, and &s;o &s;lept in &s;i|lence; but a glorious Emulation, and a lawfull Envy, confirm'd my thoughts in this liberty. It grieved me much, when I perceiv'd how the prai&s;es of this adoreable Prin|ce&s;s, was promoted among all peo|ple and Nations, and Celebrated in all &s;orts of Languages, and that the <HI>French</HI> onely, the <HI>French</HI> I &s;ay, which is &s;o much oblig'd to her, and which this Prince&s;s hath che|ri&s;h't as her owne, &s;hould be alto|gether &s;ilent in this matter. Truly 'tis this rea&s;on which makes me choo&s;e rather to &s;peake to you in <HI>French,</HI> then in any other language; it is this which hath emboldened me to a&s;cend into this place, and given protection to my weakne&s;&s;e. It is true, that this mo&s;t illu&s;trious Lord, whom the Common-wealth
<PB N="71" REF="44">of <HI>England</HI> hath &s;ent hither, and that train of Nobility which attends him, have much contributed to the naturall di&s;po&s;ition which I alwaies nouri&s;hed, to admire the actions of this incomparable Queene. The Benedictions of &s;o many religious vowes, which all of them in par|ticular have made for her pro&s;peri|tie, are manife&s;t by experience: Al&s;o it would not have beene po&s;|&s;ible for me to have confin'd with|in my &s;elf, tho&s;e happy acclamati|ons and wi&s;hes, which all <HI>England</HI> breathe forth for her advantage. Do not &s;u&s;pect that my words are couch't in a di&s;gui&s;e, they are nei|ther di&s;&s;embling nor &s;ervile: they carry the hearts of per&s;ons that are truly free, and from whom Tyranny can force up nothing of unworthy flattery. This pui&s;&s;ant Republique, which makes a world by it &s;elf, and which with the helpe of <HI>Swedland,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="45">might give Lawes to the whole Earth, produceth nothing, but what is of de&s;ert and value. If &s;he knowes how to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e, who rai&s;e them&s;elves again&s;t the glory of God, who pervert his &s;ervice, and oppre&s;s their people: She al&s;o knowes how to heape her Benedi|ctions and Prai&s;es upon good Kings: With the&s;e &s;he endeavours to con|&s;erve a reall alliance; with them, &s;he intends nothing but an eternall Warre: In a word, She admires the one &s;ort, as much as &s;he dete&s;ts the other You ought not any more to doubt of this after &s;o glorious a Te&s;timony, explained in this Am|ba&s;&s;age, which &s;he hath &s;ent to you, and by the worthy choice which &s;he made of one of her mo&s;t illu|&s;trious Lords. If that wi&s;e Com|mon wealth had not with much affection, wi&s;h't for a good corre&s;|pondence with you, for the ad|vancement
<PB N="73" REF="45">of Gods honour, and if &s;he had not regarded with admira|tion the merits of <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> &s;he would not have cho&s;en out the mo&s;t illu|&s;trious Per&s;on, among the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious, or the mo&s;t capable among the mo&s;t capable of all that great I&s;land, which is accu&s;tomed to produce &s;o many gallant men: and to &s;peak all in one word, &s;he could not have cho&s;en a per&s;on more no|ble, or more worthy of <HI>Chri&s;tina.</HI></P>
<P>Let us draw to a Conclu&s;ion therefore: my Lords, &s;eeing that all the vertues of this glorious Queene are truly Royal; and that inferiour and private per&s;ons, cannot arrive at any that may be comparable to tho&s;e; &s;ince then, they cannot be communicated to any but her &s;elfe, let us admire them as we ought: and if for the better fixing in your memory, what hath been already &s;aid, we are obliged to repeat all
