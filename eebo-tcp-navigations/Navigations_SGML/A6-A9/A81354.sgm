From thence you may with little &s;hips, or &s;hips of little draught, but not with &s;hips of great draught, at high water run o|ver the Swallow on we&s;t-north-we&s;t toward, Sheppy, for it is there &s;howld water, with &s;hips of great draught you mu&s;t run through the Fi&s;hers deep towards Black tayle.
