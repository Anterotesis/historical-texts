<HEAD>The Publi&s;her of the <HI>French</HI> Edition, to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>TWo things, courteous Reader, I have to tell thee: The one, that this Book was really made by a <HI>French-man,</HI> and &s;o that they would be to blame who &s;hould attribute it to any Stranger, who&s;e Incli|nations are bia&s;s'd again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> Hereof I was willing to adverti&s;e thee, to hinder thee from believing that Pa&s;&s;ion guided the Author's Pen. It was rather, as he prote&s;ted to me, through a de&s;ign to render him&s;elf knowing in the Hi&s;tory of the Times, that he traced the Relations which I give to the Publick. The other thing I have to tell thee, and which I de&s;ire thee to take in good part, is, That I find my &s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to declare unto my Country the Intrigues of her Neigh|bours, to make her change her Ma&s;ter, or at lea&s;t to give her another Face, by de|priving her of her <HI>Liberty.</HI> This appears &s;o natural, that I believe none can think &s;trange of my Enterprize. I will tell thee further, altho it be of no great impor|tance
<PB REF="3"> to thee, that I have received what I here give thee from the Author's own hand, who made &s;ome abode in this Town, hoping to get him&s;elf advanced in the Troops, which his Electoral Highne&s;s is rai&s;ing for the defence of the Empire: But &s;eeing great Difficulties rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t him, as there are el&s;ewhere again&s;t others, who would &s;helter them&s;elves from the Storm, he grew weary of at|tending, and bidding me adieu, delivered me his Manu&s;cript in exchange for &s;ome Books. I give it thee as I received it, without either adding or dimini&s;hing. Tho&s;e that &s;hall take the pains to read it, will &s;ee how the <HI>French</HI> neglect nothing to put them&s;elves in credit in all the Courts in <HI>Europe;</HI> and that it is not <HI>Holland</HI> alone, which they endeavour to amu&s;e by <HI>Delu&s;ory Promi&s;es,</HI> &s;o to car|ry without any oppo&s;ition, what remains for them to take in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and perhaps to pa&s;s further, if they meet with no Ob&s;tacle.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Deluding Promi&s;es SINCE THE <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unknown to any, that there have for a long time been two Powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> under the &s;helter of which the other States lived in repo&s;e and a&s;&s;urance. We know al&s;o that the&s;e two Powers are <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> who likewi&s;e recei|ved &s;uccour from the other States, to the end that the&s;e two Crowns might
<PB N="2" REF="4"> continue as it were in an equal poize, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the good of all the re&s;t. Neither of them therefore was &s;uffered to aggrandize it &s;elf to the prejudice of the other: So that if <HI>Spain</HI> formed any Enterpri&s;e, all the neighbouring Princes pre&s;ently decla|red in favour of <HI>France;</HI> if al&s;o <HI>France</HI> would make any Conque&s;ts, the &s;ame Princes failed not to oppo&s;e it. And thus they dimini&s;hed the Power of that Crown, which began to be &s;u&s;pected by them.</P>
<P>It was by this wi&s;e Policy, that the Affairs of <HI>France</HI> were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed after the taking of <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t: For the King of <HI>England,</HI> who had an Army ready imbarqu'd to make a de|&s;cent into that Kingdom, fill'd with de&s;olation and terror by the Captivi|ty of its Monarch, was the fir&s;t to propo&s;e a League again&s;t <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth; and all the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> en|tring thereinto, they obliged the Em|peror to make a Peace, and relea&s;e his Pri&s;oner, who had been carried from <HI>Pi&s;queton</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> upon Conditions far le&s;s advantagious than
<PB N="3" REF="4"> tho&s;e he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf after his Victory.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame wi&s;e Policy it was, that the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> &s;uffered the <HI>French</HI> without any oppo&s;ition to keep <HI>Mets, Thoul,</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> which they had &s;eized on by &s;urprize: For altho they had rea&s;on to be very ap|prehen&s;ive of this Nation, which is but too much addicted to u&s;urp upon its Neighbours, yet &s;ince it was at that time &s;ufficiently embara&s;&s;ed to defend it &s;elf again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> they thought rather of ma|king it their Support again&s;t that Hou&s;e, which for a long time a&s;pired after an Univer&s;al Monarchy, than of fearing le&s;t it &s;hould become one day &s;o powerful, that it would it &s;elf have a de&s;ign to oppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>This Conduct la&s;ted as long as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in a flouri&s;hing condi|tion. Wherefore the &s;ame Princes, at lea&s;t a great part of them, &s;aw al|&s;o with plea&s;ure the Strength of <HI>France</HI> augmented by the taking of <HI>Rochel,</HI> which often &s;erved no le&s;s for an A&s;ylum to Male-contents, than
<PB N="4" REF="5"> for a Rampart to tho&s;e of the Refor|med Religion. But &s;ince tho&s;e of the Religion abu&s;ed it, as we may &s;ay, by making it a Retreat for the Facti|ous; GOD would puni&s;h them, to teach them another time, that Things Divine are not to be mix'd with Pro|phane. In the mean time the Mare&s;chal de <HI>Ba&s;&s;ompiere,</HI> who &s;aw farther than many others, had a Saying witty e|nough thereupon: For being one day drinking jovially with &s;ome of his Friends, a time when Men ordi|narily di&s;cover the greate&s;t Secrets of their Heart, he told them very &s;eri|ou&s;ly, he believed they would be Fools enough to take <HI>Rochel:</HI> Which I impute not to any de&s;ign he had of making an In&s;urrection, but to his Fore&s;ight, that the taking thereof would be of as ill con&s;equence to the Neighbours of <HI>France,</HI> as it was fatal to tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion. In effect we may &s;ay, that this was the fir&s;t Step whereby the Kings of <HI>France</HI> mounted to that &s;upreme Gran|deur, which makes them at this day dreaded by all <HI>Europe.</HI> We may al&s;o
<PB N="5" REF="5"> &s;ay, that the greate&s;t Fault which e|ver the <HI>Hollanders</HI> committed in their Politicks, was, that they did not at that time a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of their Commu|nion, who might at this day do the like for them. But a&s;&s;uredly they con&s;idered it as a Rebellious Town, and believed not that it was lawful, according to the modern practice, to prefer ones Intere&s;t before whatever is mo&s;t &s;acred.</P>
<P>However it were, People being very far from believing that ever <HI>France</HI> could be &s;o powerful, as to think of encroaching upon the Liber|ty of its Neighbours, they with de|light beheld the Care that the Cardi|nal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> took to pull down the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> and they were e|ven vext, that the Con&s;piracies which were continually framed again&s;t him, and which every moment &s;prang up afre&s;h, like the Heads of <HI>Hydra,</HI> often hindred him from &s;ucceeding in his De&s;igns.</P>
<P>It was for the &s;ame rea&s;on that all the Princes, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing the &s;ecret Intrigues whereby this Mini&s;ter
<PB N="6" REF="6"> endeavoured to take the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had &s;eized it from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bra|ganza,</HI> were on the contrary very glad that this Affair went happily on. I have read in a very curious Manu|&s;cript, that all the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> furni&s;ht him with Money for that pur|po&s;e; and that the Affair being ter|minated according to their de&s;ire, they could not forbear publickly te&s;ti|fying their Joy: In&s;omuch that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> coming to know it, failed not to reproach them there|with. In the mean time the Succe&s;s &s;hewed, that if this had in &s;ome &s;ort weakned the &s;trength of that Crown, yet had it not however brought them &s;o low, but that it was &s;till capable to keep the Ballance which was &s;o requi&s;it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Men were &s;till confirmed in this O|pinion, a long time after the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had lo&s;t <HI>Portugal.</HI> For not to &s;peak of the War of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which he &s;o long &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> wherein, it mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be confe&s;&s;ed, he gain'd no great ad|vantage,
<PB N="7" REF="6"> altho he had the &s;ame time to do both with the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> he &s;o well defended him|&s;elf again&s;t the one, and made &s;uch great Conque&s;ts over the others, that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had not interpo&s;ed, he would ea&s;ily have brought them a|gain under his Yoke.</P>
<P>This Equality between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> continued till the Year 1656; except we will &s;ay, that <HI>France</HI> was much lower than <HI>Spain</HI> in the Years 1648, 1649, and &s;o on to the Years 1652, 1653, when &s;he was within two Fingers breadth of her Ruine. For it was during the &s;pace of the&s;e four Years, that there were &s;een to arrive &s;o many extraordinary things, which Po&s;terity will with difficulty believe, e&s;pecially when the begin|ning of the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. which was full of &s;o great De&s;olati|ons, &s;hall be compared with the fol|lowing Years of the &s;ame Reign, which have been accompanied with &s;o great Felicity and Power: For to comprehend all this in two words, it &s;hall &s;uffice me to &s;ay, that the King
<PB N="8" REF="7"> was once in the beginning of his Reign reduced to have but two Pullets for his Dinner; and that now, to &s;ay nothing of his Table, which is &s;uch as befits &s;o great a King, there is in eve|ry thing el&s;e &s;o extraordinary a Mag|nificence and Profu&s;ion, that every one is obliged to acknowledg, that there is none but the King of <HI>France</HI> who can at this day do as he doth.</P>
<P>But not to &s;tray too far from my Subject, I &s;ay then, that the Equality between the two Crowns &s;ub&s;i&s;ted till the Year 1656, at what time the <HI>French</HI> began to render them&s;elves &s;o redoubted in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that the other Potentates apprehended, that if the War &s;hould continue but five or &s;ix Years longer, <HI>Spain</HI> would in fine be &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>The Years 1657 and 1658 were yet more unfortunate to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who during that time &s;aw them&s;elves &s;tript of their be&s;t Places: So that it began to be well known, that if they had any thing yet in <HI>Flanders,</HI> they were wholly obliged for it to the Civil Wars of <HI>France,</HI> which made her turn
<PB N="9" REF="7"> her Arms again&s;t her &s;elf, in&s;tead of turning them again&s;t her Enemies. For in fine, it was ea&s;ier for her at that time, than it is now, to accom|pli&s;h her Enterprizes, becau&s;e that no-body being yet per&s;uaded of her Pui&s;&s;ance, they beheld her Attempts without taking Alarm thereat. It was believed al&s;o, that &s;he was obli|ged for the greate&s;t part of her Suc|ce&s;s to the Alliance &s;he had made with <HI>England,</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with great Forces both by Sea and Land, where|at every one was &s;o far from taking umbrage, that they were for &s;ome time very glad to &s;ee the humbling of a Nation, which had rendred it &s;elf odious to all others by its vanity. For we &s;ee even at this day, altho <HI>Spain</HI> be reduced to &s;o great a nece&s;&s;ity that it is the Table-talk of all <HI>Europe,</HI> yet &s;he cea&s;eth not &s;till to keep up the &s;ame Spirit, in&s;omuch that the Secre|tary of Mr. <HI>de Fuen Maior</HI> &s;aid pub|lickly not very long &s;ince at the <HI>Hague,</HI> That the French would think twice upon it before they entred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> becau&s;e they knew that
<PB N="10" REF="8"> their Places were better fortified than ever they had been; adding a thou|&s;and other Rhodomantadoes, which I will not rehear&s;e, becau&s;e the&s;e &s;orts of things are of them&s;elves &s;o dull, that they rather nau&s;eate than divert the Reader. In the mean time I will &s;ay here by the way, that when the <HI>French</HI> really entred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and a Supputation was begun to be made of the Forces the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had to man their Places, and bring into the Field again&s;t them, they were found to have about &s;ixteen thou&s;and Men di&s;tributed into many Regi|ments, a great part of which you would rather take for Beggars than Souldiers. After this it may be jud|ged how well-grounded their Brava|does are, and whether &s;o &s;mall a number of Forces is &s;ufficient to keep above thirty Places, which are yet left them in the Low-Countries, and to oppo&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> who are al|ready near forty thou&s;and &s;trong and who can encrea&s;e their Army as much as they &s;hall think fit.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8">
<P>But &s;etting a&s;ide all the&s;e things, for to go on with what I have alrea|dy begun, I &s;hall &s;ay, That at the time when <HI>France</HI> might have promi|&s;ed her &s;elf the Conque&s;t of all <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> as I have already ob&s;erved, &s;he &s;et her &s;elf to make Peace: Which I &s;hall attribute to many things; in the fir&s;t place, to the Jealou&s;y &s;he be|gan to conceive of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with whom &s;he was to &s;hare her Con|que&s;ts.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were to have <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> which is as it were the Key of <HI>France;</HI> and it did not &s;uit with the French Intere&s;t, to de&s;ire the Neigh|bourhood of a Power which had been &s;o fatal to them. I &s;hall in the &s;econd place impute it to the de&s;ire that Car|dinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of that Crown, had to pa&s;s the remain|der of his days in repo&s;e, and to give &s;ome re&s;t unto <HI>France,</HI> which &s;tood in need thereof, after having been tor|mented, not only by &s;o long a War, but al&s;o by an abundance of Edicts of this &s;ame Cardinal's Invention, who cared not how he ruined the
<PB N="12" REF="9"> People, provided he might have wherewith to marry his Nieces ad|vantagiou&s;ly. It was, in the third place, to withdraw the King from the Love of one of his Nieces, who is at this day Madam <HI>de Colonna:</HI> For altho the Cardinal could have been very glad that the King had married her, yet dur&s;t he not however at|tempt it, e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Queen-Mother oppo&s;ed it, and all <HI>France</HI> would be&s;ides have ri&s;en up again&s;t &s;o unworthy and &s;hameful an Alli|ance. In the mean time, &s;ince the Peace could not be &s;o &s;oon made, nor con&s;equently the King's Marriage, which was to be the Work of the Peace, the Cardinal married his Niece in <HI>Italy;</HI> and &s;he &s;aid to the King, who wept when &s;he was upon the point of her departure, <HI>You &s;ay you love me, I &s;ee you weep; you are King, and yet you let me go:</HI> Meaning there|by, that if he had cordially loved her, there needed none but him&s;elf to hin|der her Journey.</P>
<P>The King was for &s;ome time di&s;|contented at his lo&s;ing of Madam <HI>de
<PB N="13" REF="9"> Colonna,</HI> and to get this Love out of his head, the Cardinal brought him to <HI>Lions,</HI> whither Madam Royal, who was the King's Aunt, came with her Daughter, whom they talk'd of mar|rying with his Maje&s;ty. When Ma|dam Royal had &s;aluted the King, the King repaid her Vi&s;it, and went to &s;ee Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> whom he found before her Looking-gla&s;s, as &s;he was putting on her Hoods. She had exceeding fair Hair, and appear|ed to the King very hand&s;om in this po&s;ture, in&s;omuch that having &s;een her again afterwards, as he was &s;u&s;|ceptible enough of the Impre&s;&s;ions of Beauty, he in&s;en&s;ibly forgat Madam <HI>de Colonna,</HI> and began to love Mada|moi&s;elle <HI>de Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> knowing that the Alliance with <HI>Savoy</HI> might be &s;oon clapt up, if they did not &s;peedily take care to prevent it; and that this might perhaps prove an Ob&s;tacle to the Peace, which they de&s;ired at lea&s;t as much as Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> could do: they di&s;patch'd away <HI>Pimentel</HI> to <HI>Lions,</HI> who arrived
<PB N="14" REF="10"> there <HI>incognito,</HI> and was even a long time there, without any Bodies know|ing it except the Cardinal, to whom he cau&s;ed it to be told, that he was come to con&s;ult about the Marriage with the Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> which had a long time before been propo&s;ed on the part of <HI>France,</HI> but whereunto <HI>Spain</HI> would not at that time hearken, fore&s;eeing well, as it has &s;ince hap|pened, that in&s;tead of concluding thereby a &s;ure and durable Peace, it would one day prove a Subject of new Differences between the two Crowns. The Cardinal knowing his Arrival, &s;ent Mr. <HI>de Lionne</HI> to him, for to confer with him about the Propo|&s;itions he had to make. And the&s;e two inferior Mini&s;ters having &s;quared out a Treaty, the King had the civi|lity to acquaint Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Sa|voy</HI> with what pa&s;&s;ed, &s;incerely con|fe&s;&s;ing to her, that he &s;hould be obli|ged for the good of Peace to renounce the hopes of enjoying her, wherewith he had flattered him&s;elf, but in the mean time giving her his Word, that in ca&s;e the Treaty were not conclu|ded,
<PB N="15" REF="10"> he would never marry any but her.</P>
<P>This Promi&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|&s;olated Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> who was in the highe&s;t mea&s;ure afflicted at the coming of <HI>Pimentel.</HI> But whil&s;t &s;he was perhaps making vows for the breaking off the Treaty, Heaven di&s;|po&s;ed otherwi&s;e in the matter: For Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> and <HI>Don Lovis de Haro,</HI> meeting in the I&s;le of <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the <HI>I&s;le of Phea&s;ants,</HI> concerted between them the things whereon <HI>de Lionne</HI> and <HI>Pimentel</HI> could not agree. After which the Mare|&s;chal <HI>de Grammont</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Spain,</HI> in quality of Emba&s;&s;ador Extraordi|nary, to e&s;pou&s;e the Infanta by Proxy.</P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;y was very &s;uperb; but it had this in it particular, that the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> who was a Man of Wit, determined to ride Po&s;t into <HI>Spain,</HI> with a number of great Lords, imagining that this would ve|ry well become the Amba&s;&s;ador of a young amorous Prince. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> knowing his re&s;olution to
<PB N="16" REF="11"> arrive in this Equipage, &s;ent the Count <HI>de Taxis,</HI> Po&s;tma&s;ter-General of the Kingdom, to meet him, who furni&s;hed him with Po&s;t-Hor&s;es for him&s;elf and all his Train, which was compo&s;ed of fifty Gentlemen of Note, be&s;ides &s;ome other Per&s;ons of meaner rank. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> defrayed all his Expences upon the way, where there was as much honour done him, as if he had been the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf. And after he had received, as he pa&s;t through <HI>Burgos,</HI> the Diver|ti&s;ement of the Combat of Bulls, he arrived in the Evening at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where they were forced to light Flam|beaus to &s;ee him make his Entry, which made his Train, that was very magnificent, to appear with the great|er lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ent to receive him at his entrance into the Palace, by one of the be&s;t qualified Per&s;ons of his Court. Another came to meet him at the foot of the Stairs, and a third at the door of the Guard-Chamber. They were all accompa|nied by the greate&s;t Lords of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="11"> who being all rea&s;&s;embled in the Guard-Chamber, conducted him in the mid&s;t of them to his Audience with the King, who expected him under a Canopy embroidered with Gold, having about him all the Gran|dees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had &s;pared no Co&s;t to appear in all their Magnifi|cence to the Eyes of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King &s;aw the Mare|&s;chal <HI>de Grammont</HI> come in, he went forward three &s;teps to meet him, te|&s;tifying the Joy he received by his Journey, and asking him about the welfare of the King, and the Queen-Mother, who was his own Si&s;ter. The Mare&s;chal <HI>de Grammont</HI> having thank|ed the King for his Civility, declared to him the Subject of his Amba&s;&s;y; after which he went to the Queen, to whom having made his Comple|ment, he gave to the Infanta, who was by her &s;ide under the &s;ame Ca|nopy, a Letter from the King his Ma&s;ter; after which he di&s;cour&s;ed her always uncovered, to &s;hew that he began to &s;peak to his Queen.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="12">
<P>This Ceremony being fini&s;hed, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> re&s;olved to be him&s;elf the Conductor of his Daughter; and after he had a&s;&s;ured the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> that he would be within a little while upon the Frontiers, the Mare&s;chal took leave of him, and came to give his Ma&s;ter an account of what he had done in <HI>Spain.</HI> Some days after the King of <HI>Spain</HI> arrived with the Infanta, and the two Kings having &s;een and embraced one ano|ther, the Infanta was put into the hands of the King of <HI>France,</HI> to whom &s;he had been already married in <HI>Spain</HI> by Proxy.</P>
<P>This Alliance made all <HI>Europe</HI> en|joy a profound Tranquillity for the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even years, except the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> which was at Wars with the <HI>Turk,</HI> as was al&s;o the Emperor. The King of <HI>France</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted both the one and the other which gave a great deal of Reputati|on to his Arms: For the <HI>French</HI> being in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Turks</HI> when they attempted to pa&s;s the <HI>Raab,</HI> &s;o vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed them, that, altho
<PB N="19" REF="12"> they were &s;econded by the Imperia|li&s;ts, they failed not to carry away the principal Glory of that Jour|ney.</P>
<P>There aro&s;e al&s;o &s;ome little Trou|bles in Chri&s;tendom, as well between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> as al&s;o between that Republick and <HI>Bernard-Galen,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> But <HI>France</HI> demeaned her &s;elf &s;o in the&s;e two Rencounters, as if &s;he had been more de&s;irous to pacify all the&s;e Differences, than to excite them: For altho &s;he took part in the War &s;ometimes with the one, &s;ometimes with the other, yet &s;he comported her &s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that it could not be &s;aid, that what &s;he did was with a de&s;ign of profiting by the&s;e Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Hitherto there was not any appea|rance of her Ambition or In&s;incerity, except you will &s;ay that &s;he &s;ufficient|ly manife&s;ted it by her under-hand a&s;&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to the prejudice of what &s;he had &s;o &s;olemnly promi&s;ed by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty. In the mean time it being again&s;t the Intere&s;t of
<PB N="20" REF="13"> all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that Kingdom, there were enough found who excu&s;ed her Proceeding, whe|ther they indeed believed that this was permitted by the Laws of Policy, or whether their own Intere&s;t made them believe &s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Spark that appeared of her Ambition, which is at this day ready to con&s;ume all <HI>Europe,</HI> was in the year 1667, when without re|garding either the Faith of Treaties, or the Obligations of Blood, &s;he &s;et her &s;elf to deprive the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was yet in a full Minority, of his Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> Neverthele&s;s &s;ince &s;he dur&s;t not un|dertake the War, without having at lea&s;t a Pretext for &s;o doing, &s;he &s;pread abroad a Manife&s;to, as well in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> as in the neighbouring States, whereby it was endeavoured to be in&s;inuated, that the Queen of <HI>France,</HI> who had by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty been made to renounce what|ever &s;he could pretend unto, as well in the Succe&s;&s;ions fallen, as in tho&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="13"> that might fall, could not validly make any &s;uch Renunciation, nor yet the King for her, &s;ince &s;he was not only under age, but what &s;he did was in complacency to the King her Father, who had forced her thereun|to. As to the King, it was al&s;o a&s;|&s;erted, That he was not at all obliged by whatever Renunciation he had made, becau&s;e by the Laws of the Realm the Kings could do nothing without the con&s;ent of the Parlia|ment of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had refu&s;ed to verify the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, &s;eeing it &s;o di&s;advantagious to the Dauphin, who ought one day to be Heir to the Queen his Mother. From all the&s;e rea&s;ons it was inferred, That the King might lawfully carry his Arms into <HI>Flanders,</HI> unle&s;s <HI>Spain</HI> did him Ju&s;tice upon his Preten&s;ions, which extended over all <HI>Brabant,</HI> and the be&s;t Places of the other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> And this was founded upon an ancient Cu&s;tom there was in tho&s;e Places, whence all the&s;e Preten&s;ions aro&s;e, by which a Daughter of a fir&s;t Venter ex|cludes
<PB N="22" REF="14"> even the Sons of a &s;econd.</P>
<P>This <HI>Manifesto</HI> was no &s;ooner pub|li&s;hed, being compo&s;ed by a learned Advocate of <HI>Paris,</HI> but it made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon the Minds of the Peo|ple, and principally of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> who altho they loved not the <HI>French,</HI> had yet rather fall under their Domi|nion, than &s;ee them&s;elves daily ex|po&s;ed to their Arms. The Baron <HI>d' I&s;ola,</HI> who bore a very great affecti|on to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> by which he was employed in important Nego+tiations, took at the &s;ame time Pen in hand, to di&s;abu&s;e the People knowing that a longer Prevention was capable to produce bad Effects. Having in fine compo&s;ed a little Book in an&s;wer to the Pari&s;ian Advocate the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> was therein &s;o well maintain'd, that if that Crown had had Souldiers, who would have defended her as gallantly with the Sword, as the Baron <HI>d' I&s;ola</HI> had done with the Pen, &s;he might have laugh'd at all her Enemies.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;ince it was not by the point of the Pen, but of the
<PB N="23" REF="14"> Sword, that this Quarrel was to be determined, the King of <HI>France</HI> en|tred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the head of a flouri&s;hing Army, being followed by the Queen in this Journey, becau&s;e he believed, that &s;he being of the Blood of the legitimate Sovereigns of the&s;e Provinces, the People would therefore &s;hew the le&s;s aver&s;ion for the <HI>French.</HI> He took at fir&s;t <HI>Charle|roy,</HI> which made no great re&s;i&s;tance, the Place not being yet above half-built. Then entring into the Heart of the Country, he po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of <HI>Tournay, Ats, Courtray, Oudenarde,</HI> and &s;ome other Places of le&s;s impor|tance. The Mare&s;chal <HI>d' Aumont,</HI> who commanded a Flying Army on the &s;ide of the Maritime Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;eized al&s;o of &s;ome &s;trong Places; after which the King laid Siege to <HI>L'I&s;le,</HI> which is the chief Town of his <HI>Gallican Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> vvere already &s;o weak, that their Places had not above half the Garri&s;ons that were nece&s;|&s;ary for their Defence. As for <HI>L'I&s;le,</HI> they had made a little better provi&s;i|on,
<PB N="24" REF="15"> and the Con&s;ervation thereof be|ing of great con&s;equence to them, they drew out &s;ome Garri&s;ons from the mo&s;t remote Places, and &s;uch as they thought &s;ecure, whereof they formed a &s;mall Army, vvith vvhich they re&s;olved to &s;uccour this Town, The King knowing that they vvere in the Field, &s;ent to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi,</HI> vvho commanded four or five thou&s;and Hor&s;e on the &s;ide of <HI>Ardenna,</HI> to come to him without de|lay. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi</HI> having received &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Orders, mar|ched day and night to obey them; and having but a &s;mall Body, and that all Hor&s;e, which is not &s;o em|bara&s;&s;ing as a great Army, that draws after it abundance of Luggage, made &s;uch &s;peed, that he arrived at the King's Army three days after he had received his Orders.</P>
<P>The King, who &s;pared nothing in Spies, having learnt that the Count <HI>de Mar&s;in</HI> al&s;o on his &s;ide advanced at the Head of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, de|tached the Marque&s;s de <HI>Crequi</HI> with a Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, to go and
<PB N="25" REF="15"> &s;eize upon a certain Pa&s;&s;age; the gal|lante&s;t Men about the Court de&s;ired to make part of this Detachment, be|lieving that there would be playing at Sharps: But the King re&s;training their Ardor, obliged them to &s;tay at the Siege, which he pro&s;ecuted in the mean time without giving any relaxa|tion to the Enemy. <HI>Mar&s;in,</HI> who had at fir&s;t made great Marches, knowing that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the only Pa&s;|&s;age by which he could &s;uccour <HI>L'I&s;le,</HI> found his Courage cool &s;o much the more, as the Po&s;t was advantagious to the Enemy, whom he could not undertake to force thence, without putting him&s;elf and his Army in mo&s;t evident danger: He continued how|ever to go on, and being arrived within three quarters of a League of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi,</HI> he pitch'd his Camp in a Place &s;trongly &s;eated, but which yet not &s;eeming to him &s;trong enough, he fortified by good Retrenchments. But &s;carce had his Souldiers put their hands to the work, when the King, who had made him|&s;elf
<PB N="26" REF="16"> Ma&s;ter of <HI>L'I&s;le</HI> by Compo&s;ition, drew his Troops through the mid&s;t of the Town, which much &s;hortned their way, and putting him&s;elf at their head, he took, as he went, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi</HI> along with him, and went to attack the Enemy, who on his &s;ide prepared to give him a good reception. <HI>Mar&s;in,</HI> who was a Man of Wat, believing at fir&s;t that he had to do only with the Troops of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Crequi,</HI> bravely re|ceived the fir&s;t Troops, which ad|vanced to force his Retrenchments; but when he heard the Drums of the Musketeers, who&s;e March he knew, and &s;aw be&s;ides the Troops of the King's Hou&s;hold, who were to be known by the Gold upon their Cloaths, which the other Troops had not, cau&s;ed the Retreat to be &s;ound|ed, and endeavoured to make it with the lea&s;t confu&s;ion po&s;&s;ible. But the <HI>French</HI> breaking into his Retrench|ments &s;o much the more ea&s;ily, in that there was none to guard them fell upon his Rear, which they put in great di&s;order. <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> ran &s;peedily
<PB N="27" REF="16"> thither, and as he equally performed the Duty of a Captain and a Souldi|er, &s;ometimes giving Orders, and &s;ometimes fighting in per&s;on, when he &s;aw him&s;elf pre&s;s'd, he wanted but little of falling into the Enemies hands by the fault of his Hor&s;e, who rearing up an end, threw him to the ground. In fine, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were wholly di&s;comfited, and there were five or &s;ix hundred kill'd upon the place, two hundred that died of their Wounds, and three or four hundred that were taken Pri&s;oners. There were pre&s;ented to the King &s;ix Co|lours, and two Standards, that had been taken in the Fight, and the King rewarded tho&s;e that pre&s;ented them.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;in</HI> being defeated, the King marched again&s;t the Town of <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> which altho it were of no great De|fence, yet cau&s;ed the Enemy &s;ome Lo&s;s. In effect, the <HI>French,</HI> puff'd up with the taking of <HI>L'I&s;le,</HI> and the Succe&s;s of the Battel they had given the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> pre&s;ented them&s;elves in full day within Musket-&s;hot of the
<PB N="28" REF="17"> Town; but before they got them|&s;elves any &s;helter, they had a great many Men killed, without reckoning the Wounded, which were al&s;o in no &s;mall number. The Trenches being opened, and the Batteries rai&s;ed, which began to thunder upon the Town, it yielded to the King, who put a Garri&s;on in it, which he might have done at the beginning of the Campaign without the lo&s;s of a Man, for he had found this Place abandon|ed, but he believed it not to be of &s;o great con&s;equence as it was, which is now but too well known, &s;ince it is at this day the Subject of the War wherewith we are menaced, not to &s;ay the Pretext. After the taking of <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> the King retired to <HI>Arras,</HI> where the Queen attended him, and from thence &s;et forth for <HI>St. Germain en laye,</HI> which was the Place where he made his Abode.</P>
<P>The happy Succe&s;s which the King had during this Campaign, joined with the pitiful condition wherein the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were, who could not bring ten thou&s;and Men together, made
<PB N="29" REF="17"> the neighbouring Princes think it their Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e in time <HI>France</HI>'s aggrandizing her &s;elf any more. Thus carried on by the &s;ame Spirit, which had made them &s;o often take the part of <HI>France</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they took then the part of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> The King of <HI>England,</HI> the King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made an Alliance together, called the Triple-League, whereby they united them&s;elves not to kindle the Fire, which already burnt but too fiercely, but to endea|vour to quench it; and in ca&s;e either of the two Crowns &s;hould ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in the War, it was &s;tipulated that they &s;hould declare them&s;elves a|gain&s;t it; which Clau&s;e was expre&s;ly put in, not to irritate <HI>France</HI> by te&s;tify|ing that this Treaty was directly con|cluded only to oppo&s;e her Ambition. But <HI>France,</HI> who knew what to think of it, was &s;o incen&s;ed thereby, and particularly again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom &s;he accu&s;ed to have procured this League to be &s;igned by the others, that &s;he re&s;olved in time and place to
<PB N="30" REF="18"> be revenged thereof. In the mean time, not being &s;trong enough to re|&s;i&s;t alone the&s;e three Potentates, &s;he was obliged to promi&s;e, that &s;he would lay down her Arms, if <HI>Spain</HI> would on her &s;ide con&s;ent that &s;he &s;hould continue in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her new Conque&s;ts, <HI>Alo&s;t</HI> being excepted, which &s;he offered to re&s;tore. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not at fir&s;t hear &s;peak of this Treaty, and were re|&s;olved not to permit that the Right of Convenience &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed thus at their prejudice. But two things made them &s;oon change their Re&s;olution: The one, that whil&s;t they were amu&s;ed in talking of an Accommodation, <HI>France</HI> had all on a &s;udden &s;eized upon <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;.</HI> The other, that one of the three States began, as they &s;ay, to waver when it came to the point, having been gained by the Money of <HI>France,</HI> whereof it was more &s;en&s;ible, than of its own true Intere&s;ts. The Mi|ni&s;ters of <HI>Holland,</HI> who were em|ployed in this Treaty, know whether I impo&s;e any thing contrary to truth,
<PB N="31" REF="18"> and I know that it was they who fir&s;t began to perceive &s;o &s;hameful a Com|merce. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> therefore con|&s;ented that the King &s;hould keep all the Places he had taken, except <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;,</HI> and the County of <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> which he had already promi&s;ed to re&s;tore unto them.</P>
<P>It is be&s;ides to be under&s;tood, that <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;</HI> had been conquered in eight days; but that which rendred this Conque&s;t &s;o ea&s;y is, that <HI>France</HI> had gained the Governour, who after he had made this fine Bargain with her, retired to <HI>Paris.</HI> But as the Trea&s;on is much better loved than the Traitors, I believe they kept but a part of their Promi&s;e vvith him, at lea&s;t I have been told as much by one that pretended to know it. In the mean time, tho&s;e that were employ|ed to bring the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to con&s;ent to the Treaty, as it had been propo|&s;ed before the taking of <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;,</HI> let <HI>France</HI> know, that the concluding the Peace depended only on her. <HI>France</HI> &s;tuck at the parting with &s;o fair a Province, but it being
<PB N="32" REF="19"> nece&s;&s;ary either to do it, or to re|&s;olve upon War, &s;he cho&s;e that part that &s;eemed to her mo&s;t for her ad-advantage, which was to give up this new Conque&s;t, together with the County of <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> according as &s;he had agreed to do. Thus by the Entremi&s;e of the Triple-League was Peace re|&s;tored to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But before I pa&s;s any further, I mu&s;t acquaint thee with &s;o unworthy an Action then done by the <HI>French,</HI> that Po&s;terity will &s;carce believe it, nor &s;hould I my &s;elf have believed it, had I not &s;een it with my own eyes. It was accorded by an Article of the Treaty, That whatever &s;hould on the day of the Ratification of the Peace be found upon the Lands of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould appertain unto her; and that whatever in like manner &s;hould be found upon the Lands of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;hould appertain to the Crown of <HI>Spain. France</HI> therefore, de&s;igning to make her advantage of this Article, cau&s;ed, before the coming of the Ratificati|on, the Ax to be &s;et to a Wood of tall over-grown Trees, which was
<PB N="33" REF="19"> upon the Lands of <HI>Spain,</HI> and having fell'd the Timber, tran&s;ported it into her own Lands, that when the Rati|fication &s;hould come, &s;he might di&s;|po&s;e thereof at her plea&s;ure. I appeal to the Duke <HI>d' Ar&s;chot,</HI> or the Prince <HI>de Chimay,</HI> to te&s;tify whether I &s;ay any thing but Truth; for I well know that this Wood belonged to one of them, tho I cannot at pre&s;ent remember to which of the two it was.</P>
<P>War was not the &s;ole Affliction which this year befell <HI>Flanders,</HI> GOD &s;ending them moreover &s;o terrible a Plague, that there was &s;carce an Hou&s;e exempted from it. In the mean time GOD pre&s;erved the <HI>French,</HI> of whom, tho they were in Garri&s;on in the Towns where it made the greate&s;t ravage, and above all at <HI>Oudenarde,</HI> yet was there not &s;o much as one that died thereof. Some impute this to their Temper, which is very diffe|rent from that of the <HI>Flemings;</HI> but for my part I attribute it to a per|mi&s;&s;ion of GOD, who, when he plea|&s;es, &s;aves &s;ome to take others.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="20">
<P>The Peace being made, as I ju&s;t now told you, every one enjoyed in repo&s;e the Benefit he might expect thereof. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> alone, for having laboured for the Publick Good, &s;aw them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the Ha|tred of <HI>France,</HI> who expected only a favourable occa&s;ion to make them feel her re&s;entment. The Occa&s;ion, or, to &s;ay better, the Pretext was &s;oon found. As there is nothing &s;uf|fered to be printed in <HI>France</HI> without Licen&s;e, &s;ome French-men, who were not perhaps over-well &s;atisfied with the Government, or who, it may be, had received &s;ome particular di&s;con|tent, publi&s;hed certain diffamatory Libels again&s;t the King and his Mini|&s;ters, which bearing on their Title-page the Name of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> as the place of their Impre&s;&s;ion, the King took great Offence thereat, as if it were not u&s;ual to put upon a Book the Name of a Printer that knows nothing of it. There appeared al&s;o &s;ometime after a Print, wherein the King was repre&s;ented upon a Hor&s;e without Bit or Bridle, with this In|&s;cription,
<PB N="35" REF="20"> <HI>He knows not whither he goes:</HI> In&s;inuating thereby, that it was to no purpo&s;e for him to make &s;o many Reviews, that he might &s;ur|prize one or other, &s;ince he would every where find re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But of all which at that time ap|peared, for I mention not here the hundredth part, there was not any thing better invented, or more to the purpo&s;e, than a certain Medal, on the one &s;ide whereof was repre&s;ented Mon&s;ieur <HI>van Beuningen,</HI> who had the greate&s;t &s;hare in managing the fore|mentioned Treaty of the Triple-League: and on the rever&s;e, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> &s;taying the cour&s;e of the Sun, with the&s;e Latin Words, <HI>In con&s;pectu meo &s;tetit Sol.</HI> Now we mu&s;t know that the Sun was the French King's De|vice, and that tho&s;e who had invent|ed this Medal, meant thereby, that even as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had &s;tayed the Cour&s;e of the Sun, for to defeat the <HI>Phili|&s;tins;</HI> &s;o Mon&s;ieur <HI>van Beuningen,</HI> who was called <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> &s;tayed the Cour&s;e of the King, that was upon the point to de&s;troy the <HI>Flemings.</HI></P>
<PB N="36" REF="21">
<P>This Medal no &s;ooner appeared abroad, but <HI>France</HI> highly menaced tho&s;e who had made it; and &s;ince &s;he accu&s;ed the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thereof, they thought it became them to &s;hew the whole World, that they were not capable of &s;uch Actions. Wherefore they gave in charge to their Amba&s;|&s;ador to di&s;abu&s;e the King and his Mini&s;ters, but to take his time &s;o fit|ly for the doing it, that it might not be believed they were induced to make this Excu&s;e through the fear of their Menaces. In the mean time, to &s;ay the Truth, this Medal was ne|ver either invented or made in <HI>Hol|land;</HI> I have heard &s;ay that it was made at <HI>Rome,</HI> and was the Inventi|on of the <HI>Italians,</HI> who being, if we may &s;o &s;ay, plunged over Head and Ears in Repo&s;e and Delights, know not oftentimes what to apply them|&s;elves unto, unle&s;s it be to &s;peak ill of their Neighbour. Others impute it to &s;ome di&s;contented French-man, who had perhaps been fru&s;trated in his de&s;ires, or otherwi&s;e ill treated. How|ever it was, this I well know, that
<PB N="37" REF="21"> there is not &s;o much as one Per&s;on in all <HI>Holland,</HI> who will grant that it was made in their Country, which yet, if it were &s;o, they would ea&s;ily acknowledg, &s;ince they are not over-guilty of concealing what they do.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Peace, whereof I ere-while &s;pake, was &s;till in being, but withal it was plainly &s;een, that in the E&s;tate wherein things were, it could not long continue. <HI>France,</HI> who was &s;en&s;ible of her own Power, daily, as we may &s;ay, provoked eve|ry one with her Bravadoes; and there was none but the King of <HI>England</HI> whom &s;he managed, becau&s;e &s;he knew he was &s;trong at Sea, and would be a great Succour to tho&s;e in who&s;e favour he &s;hould declare him&s;elf. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who knew all the Steps which <HI>France</HI> made towards him, endeavoured on their &s;ide to keep up the good Intelligence which was be|tween the two Nations, tho not with their ancient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s, as belie|ving it no le&s;s the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to hold a good Corre&s;pon|dence with them, than it was theirs
<PB N="38" REF="22"> to live in amity with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Things were in this condition when there aro&s;e a Difference be|tween that Republick and <HI>England</HI> upon the Subject of Commerce. The Republick endeavoured &s;peedily and amicably to terminate this Affair, but the King of <HI>England</HI> who was highly &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome former Indig|nities of theirs, being ince&s;&s;antly &s;ol|licited by <HI>France</HI> to declare War a|gain&s;t them, was &s;o re&s;olute to make his own Terms in this Treaty, that the Republick thought fit to have re|cour&s;e to <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t it was not to &s;uffer the King of <HI>England</HI> to become &s;o powerful. <HI>France</HI> for &s;ome time amu&s;ed their Amba&s;&s;ador as if &s;he had a de&s;ign to make a League with them; but as what &s;he did, was only to have time to gain the King of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Friend|&s;hip &s;he courted at an high rate; &s;he had no &s;ooner perfected her Treaty with him, but &s;he began clearly to manife&s;t her Intentions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I might here &s;ay, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;omewhat defici|ent
<PB N="39" REF="22"> in their Conduct towards the King of <HI>England,</HI> with whom mat|ters might have been accommodated notwith&s;tanding his great Preten&s;i|ons. But &s;ince I know that the &s;ole Ob&s;tacle herein was Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> Pen|&s;ionary of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had a great influence on that Commonwealth, I &s;hould be to blame, &s;hould I ca&s;t up|on many, what was the Fault of one alone: For in fine, it was none but he that hindred the terminating the Difference with the King of <HI>England,</HI> who was willing to remit many things in favour of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> for whom he demanded &s;ome E&s;ta|bli&s;hment; but <HI>de Witt</HI>'s Jealou&s;y of this Prince was &s;o great, that he pre|ferr'd his own particular Intere&s;ts be|fore the common Utility. Not but that he was a Man of great Wit, and who fore&s;aw well enough vvhatever might be the Con&s;equence of an Af|fair; but he had his Heart too much envenomed again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI> vvhereunto I &s;hall attribute all the Infelicities vvhich &s;oon after befell that Republick. In the mean
<PB N="40" REF="23"> time, I will not &s;ay here, as many others have done, that this was an Effect of the Intelligence he had with the <HI>French:</HI> For let none believe, that to make my Court to the Living, I will dig up the Dead, and make their Proce&s;s. Believe not, I &s;ay, that I will a&s;&s;ert a thing which I know not, and whereof it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be very well a&s;&s;ured before I &s;peak. In effect, a Writer, who de|&s;ires to have the Reputation of an hone&s;t Man, mu&s;t be very careful to write nothing whereof he is not ex|ceeding certain. Not but that there are very often things related, which are &s;omewhat problematical; but it is then the Author's duty to let the Reader under&s;tand, that he is left to the liberty of believing as he &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>I &s;ay then, &s;peaking of Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> that altho he were a very wi&s;e Man, he was neverthele&s;s mightily over&s;een in not making his Peace with the King of <HI>England.</HI> For to to come a little clo&s;er to the matter: It behoved him either to &s;atisfy that
<PB N="41" REF="23"> King in what he required, or to be &s;ure of the Alliance with the <HI>French,</HI> that he might not have at the &s;ame time the&s;e two Powers upon his Back; but &s;ince in&s;tead of having the <HI>French</HI> for him, it was they, on the contra|ry, that exa&s;perated matters, he had no other way but to content the King of <HI>England,</HI> who had many times de|manded the Re&s;titution of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Offices which had been enjoyed by his Predece&s;&s;ors, with &s;o much Reputation to them&s;elves, and Advantage to the Common|wealth.</P>
<P>Moreover, had I undertaken it, I could ea&s;ily here demon&s;trate, That there was nothing &s;o contrary to the Good of the State, as the having thus removed the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> from the Affairs thereof. But &s;ince it would occa&s;ion the believing of what I will not have believed, that what I &s;hould do therein would be to captivate the Honour of his good Graces, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with &s;aying, That if Mr. <HI>de Witt</HI> prevari|cated in any thing, it was undoubtedly
<PB N="42" REF="24"> in this. But be it how it will, the Republick learning from all parts, that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> made terri|ble preparations for the making War upon her both by Sea and Land, did on their &s;ide what they believed them|&s;elves obliged to do, not to be &s;o &s;oon overwhelmed.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign is not to engage here in the Hi&s;tory of a War &s;o long and te|dious as that was; for tho I was pre|&s;ent at many great Actions which pa&s;t therein, and can &s;peak thereof with as much a&s;&s;urance as another, yet &s;ince they fought in &s;o many pla|ces, that one Man cannot have been at them all, I &s;hould be obliged to re|port many things upon the Te&s;timo|ny of others, which is very often de|ceitful, every one ordinarily adding or dimini&s;hing in his Recital, accord|ing to his particular Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes according to the Love he has for his Country. I &s;hall not how|ever pa&s;s &s;ilently over the Things I &s;hall think fit for my purpo&s;e, which is to &s;hew the Ambition of <HI>France,</HI> and the Maxims &s;he makes u&s;e of
<PB N="43" REF="24"> to bring about her De&s;igns.</P>
<P>It is very certain, that when the two Kings re&s;olved to declare War again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that Common|wealth was in no good condition to undergo it, whereof I will alledg three principal Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t was the little Union there was between the principal Per|&s;ons of the State, whereof &s;ome blind|ly followed the Pa&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> and others on the contrary demanded the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in all the Offices of his Ance|&s;tors. Every one knows the Conte&s;ts which arrived thereupon, and that in fine, neither of the Parties getting the Advantage, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was cho&s;en Captain-General of the State, but with &s;o limited a Power, as it was ea&s;ily to be judged, that if Mr. <HI>de Witt</HI> was not able to obtain his whole de&s;ire, he had at lea&s;t obtained a part thereof.</P>
<P>But what neverthele&s;s &s;hews that his Spirit reigned not &s;o much as it heretofore had done in the Re&s;oluti|ons of State, is what pa&s;s'd &s;ome
<PB N="44" REF="25"> time after, and I am here going to relate. He perceiving that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by his winning Temper, obliging Conduct, and in fine, by &s;o many excellent Qualities as are in his Per&s;on, daily gain'd new Creatures; and that on the contrary, his own Credit every day dimini&s;hed: he be|gan to think of &s;heltring him&s;elf from the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of this Prince. I know that he con&s;ulted thereupon Mr. <HI>de Groot,</HI> and another Per&s;on, who yet in my opinion is no great Politician; and that they both confirmed him in the Re&s;olution he had already taken, to make a Levy of Twelve Thou&s;and Men in the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> be&s;ides the For|ces they were to rai&s;e in conjunction with the other Provinces. His de&s;ign herein was to be always Ma&s;ter of the&s;e Twelve Thou&s;and Men, who were never to go out of Garri&s;on, and he would not have the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to have any Authority over them: wherefore he had already pitch'd upon <HI>Mombas</HI> for their Com|mander, in an opinion, without doubt,
<PB N="45" REF="25"> that he could not chu&s;e a greater Cap|tain to continue in Garri&s;on. But the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> whom this En|terpri&s;e every way concerned, but principally in re&s;pect of his Office of Captain-General of the State, which was thereby &s;truck at, &s;o vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it, that all this great De|&s;ign vani&s;hed away in Smoke.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on which &s;hould have made the <HI>States</HI> fear the not ha|ving any great Succe&s;s in this War, is, That they had &s;carce any Troops to guard &s;o many &s;trong Places, whereof their little Country is com|po&s;ed, tho&s;e they had being moreo|ver raw and unexperienced, &s;eeming to have participated of the Nature of the Inhabitants, who are &s;o ad|dicted to Trade, that they &s;eem now uncapable of any thing el&s;e. In ef|fect, as a Man becomes a Smith by his often working in Iron; &s;o is it to be believed, that no Man becomes a Souldier, if he be not often in occa|&s;ions of War. For this neverthele&s;s there &s;eemed to be a Remedy, which was to have recour&s;e to the neigh|bouring
<PB N="46" REF="26"> Princes, who had good Troops on foot, for which they ap|peared not to have any u&s;e; but when they would addre&s;s to them, they found the&s;e Princes &s;o alarm'd at the De&s;igns of <HI>France,</HI> that not knowing whether &s;he would not turn her Arms upon their Countries, they were glad to &s;tand upon their Guards.</P>
<P>The third Rea&s;on, and the la&s;t, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e which I intend to alledg is, That there was no hope of ha|ving any Succour from Princes more remote, whereof &s;ome were Pen&s;io|naries of <HI>France,</HI> and others &s;o weak and timerous, that they &s;eemed to be afraid of offending her. It was to little purpo&s;e for the <HI>States</HI> to re|pre&s;ent to them, that their Intere&s;ts ought to be common again&s;t a com|mon Enemy, who a&s;pired after an Univer&s;al Monarchy; they were in|&s;en&s;ible, as I may &s;ay: Which I do not however find very &s;trange, &s;ince they are not at pre&s;ent much le&s;s tho many of them are in a great mea|&s;ure &s;tript of their Soveraignty. The Emperor neverthele&s;s took fire at the
<PB N="47" REF="26"> Con&s;equences that were at that time remark'd unto him, and which we at this day &s;ee to be &s;o fune&s;t; but ha|ving &s;poken but a moment with Fa|ther <HI>Emerick,</HI> or &s;ome other Je&s;uit, how far was he from being the Man he &s;eemed to be but a minute before! They repre&s;ented it to him as a &s;cru|ple of Con&s;cience, to undertake a War in favour of an Heretical Re|publick; and he &s;o readily fell into all the Snares they laid for him, that when he was pre&s;s'd for an An&s;wer, it was plainly &s;een, that 'twas no longer the Emperor who &s;pake, but the Monks, who &s;pake through the Emperor's Mouth. Thus whil&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King at the head of his Army &s;truck a Terror into all that part of <HI>Germany</HI> which lies near the <HI>Rhine,</HI> did he amu&s;e him&s;elf with cau&s;ing to be &s;ung in his Clo&s;et an Air of De|votion, being encompa&s;s'd by twenty Je&s;uits, who were Judges of the Me|lody, and who never failed to ap|plaud the&s;e worthy Employs of an Emperor. It was then through their Coun&s;el, that he would not give any
<PB N="48" REF="27"> po&s;itive An&s;wer to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> till he had fir&s;t con&s;ulted Heaven at <HI>Marienzel,</HI> whither he went with unconceivable Super&s;titions, altho tho&s;e that loved his Per&s;on, or the Good of the Empire, endeavoured to di&s;abu&s;e him by the way.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits kept as clo&s;e to him in this Journey, as the Shadow doth to the Body; for they intending to &s;ell him, and it being impo&s;&s;ible for them to deliver him, if he once took Re&s;olutions worthy an Emperor they endeavoured to entertain his Su|per&s;titions, to the end they might ac|compli&s;h their Work. One time, when there being arrived a Courier, who brought pre&s;&s;ing News, the Em|peror bade he &s;hould attend, for that he was bu&s;ied about other Affairs; yet could it not be gue&s;s'd what Af|fairs the&s;e might be, no Body having been &s;een to go in with him, till an hour, or perhaps I &s;hould not lie if I &s;aid an hour and half after, four Je|&s;uits were &s;een to come forth, and when the&s;e Gentlemen were gone out, the Courier was brought in.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="27">
<P>But to return to the Voyage or <HI>Marienzel,</HI> every one expected to &s;ee the Emperor take a Re&s;olution con|formable to the Sentiments which the Je&s;uits endeavoured to in&s;pire in|to him, when one of his principal Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Name I am mad with my &s;elf for having forgot, being thereby hindred from recommending it to Po&s;terity, bethought him&s;elf of an Artifice ingenious enough, to ex|cite him to act once like an Emperor. He had during the Night received a Courier, who brought the News of the great Succe&s;s that <HI>France</HI> had had in <HI>Holland,</HI> and of &s;ome Intrigues &s;he was working in <HI>Germany,</HI> but delay|ed telling him thereof till he was rea|dy to go to Church, for fear the Je|&s;uits &s;hould turn his Mind, if they had time to di&s;cour&s;e him. He &s;hew|ed him then the News he had recei|ved as he was going to Ma&s;s, pre|tending that they were but newly arrived, and without expecting till the Emperor demanded his Advice, told him, There was no longer time to deliberate thereon, unle&s;s he would
<PB N="50" REF="28"> lo&s;e the Empire with all the Heredi|tary Countries. None knew where|on he di&s;cour&s;ed the Emperor, tho every one de&s;ired to know it, becau&s;e they &s;aw him &s;peak fervently, and e|ven with &s;ome &s;ort of tran&s;port. But this Mini&s;ter, being very willing that all tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, whom he believed to be well-minded, &s;hould help him to de&s;troy the ill Coun&s;els which the Je&s;uits might have given the Emperor, at the &s;ame time acquainted them with what pa&s;s'd, and then there was no longer heard about him any thing, but that there was no more time to be lo&s;t, and that War mu&s;t be declared again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Je&s;uits were not there to be con&s;ulted upon &s;o important an Affair; they were already gone to the Church, believing that there would be no o|ther In&s;piration but theirs: But the Emperor being throughly heated at the News he had ju&s;t learnt, no longer remembred the Le&s;&s;ons they had given him. Things however went on in all the Forms, as if he had
<PB N="51" REF="28"> indeed expected &s;ome In&s;piration from Heaven: For after he had pro&s;trated him&s;elf with his face to the ground, and continued &s;ome time in this po|&s;ture, taking a Crucifix into his hands, he ki&s;s'd it three or four times, then looking fixedly upon it, as if he ex|pected it &s;hould an&s;wer him, he on a &s;udden lifted up his voice, and &s;aid: <HI>O GOD of Mercy and Goodne&s;s, teach me whether I mu&s;t at this day entertain Peace, or declare War! Ought I to be in&s;en&s;ible of the Enterprizes of</HI> France? <HI>and mu&s;t I let her take from me the Imperial Crown, which thou ha&s;t put upon my Head, without endeavouring to keep it?</HI> He &s;aid no more, but ha|ving again ki&s;s'd his Crucifix three or four times, bowed him&s;elf down as he had done before; then rai&s;ing him|&s;elf again all of a &s;udden, he turned towards the People, and &s;aid unto them, That it was done, that GOD would have him make War; but that he took the &s;ame GOD to witne&s;s, that what he did was not through Ambition.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29">
<P>The Emperor's Prayer, which was not very long, extremely plea&s;ed the Je&s;uits, who are accu&s;ed of delight|ing more in the Courts of Princes, than in the Church of GOD. In ef|fect, tho&s;e that know the Original of the Quarrel, which was not long &s;ince agitated between the French King and the Pope, attribute it to the Fear they had le&s;t this Pope, who was not &s;o Je&s;uit-ridden as his Predece&s;&s;ors, &s;hould oblige them to do as the other Monks, that is, to &s;ing High-Ma&s;s, to &s;ay Ve&s;pers in publick, to ri&s;e in the Night to &s;ing Mattins, and to perform all other Mona&s;tical Functi|ons, which I neither know, nor ever &s;hall know, having never been a Monk, nor yet ever intending to be one. They &s;ay, That the Je&s;uits, having already received &s;ome Marks that the Pope loved them not, whil&s;t he was yet but Cardinal, were &s;till more per&s;uaded thereof a little after his Exaltation, he having &s;poken in an A&s;&s;embly of Cardinals of giving them a Protector, as other Religious Per&s;ons have, that is to &s;ay, a Man
<PB N="53" REF="29"> who &s;hould look after their Actions, and give an account thereof. And indeed there would be nothing more advantagious or more nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of Chri&s;tendom: for were it &s;o, we &s;hould not at this day &s;ee &s;o many Factions in all the Courts of Princes, where we ob&s;erve Men who would have us believe that they have renounced the World, intermedling not only in Matters of State, but al|&s;o in the Affairs of particular Per|&s;ons; we &s;hould not &s;ee &s;o many Hu&s;|bands di&s;contented with their Wives, &s;o many Wives refractory to their Husbands; &s;o many Children di&s;obe|dient to their Parents, &s;o many Pa|rents unnatural towards their Chil|dren: for in fine, their Charms ex|tend even to the perverting the Or|der of Nature, as well as the Order of Monarchies: but they take little care for whatever may be thought of their Conduct, provided they bring about their pernicious De&s;igns. I might &s;ay many other things, which would be no le&s;s true than the&s;e; but &s;ince there is none, who knows not
<PB N="54" REF="30"> that whatever pa&s;&s;es at this day fune&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> is the &s;ad Effect of their abominable Coun&s;els, it is better to pa&s;s over what I have to &s;ay in &s;ilence, for to let the Imagination work, which is fill'd with &s;o great an Idea of their Wickedne&s;s, that all I can &s;ay thereof is but a Trifle in com|pari&s;on of what every one &s;aith within him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But to return to their Conduct to|wards the Pope. When they &s;aw that he already &s;poke of giving them a Protector, they a&s;&s;embled their be&s;t Heads, and re&s;olved to rai&s;e him up &s;o many Affairs, that he &s;hould not have time to think only upon them. And &s;ince there was no Per&s;on in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> more capable to make the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> tremble, than the French King, who had already terrified &s;o many other States, they in&s;inuated into him by the means of his Confe&s;|&s;or Father <HI>le Chai&s;e,</HI> that the Pope daily enterpri&s;ed upon his Authority; that if he did not make a timely op|po&s;ition, it was to be feared he would &s;till more and more entrench thereon.
<PB N="55" REF="30"> A Canon of <HI>Pamiers</HI> in the County of <HI>Foix,</HI> happened to die ju&s;t in the nick; to entangle matters, they cau|&s;ed the King to provide a Succe&s;&s;or for his Benefice, tho it was not his Cu&s;tom to do it; and the Bi&s;hop ha|ving on his part provided one, as it was his Right according to the U&s;age to do, they &s;o far animated the King again&s;t the Bi&s;hop, that he was at the &s;ame time pro&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Pope, who was not only jea|lous to con&s;erve the Rights whereof he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o to fol|low the laudable Cu&s;tom of his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors, who have u&s;urped &s;o ma|ny, that they are at this day equal, not to &s;ay &s;uperior, to the greate&s;t Kings, believed that his Authority was concerned not to &s;uffer a Bi&s;hop to be ill-treated for having done his Duty. See then at the &s;ame time the Arms of <HI>Rome</HI> in the Field, I mean a great Number of Briefs, which are called in this Court <HI>Spiritual Arms;</HI> but than they &s;hould not make much progre&s;s which they might have done if they found no re&s;i&s;tance, there was

For in fine, al|tho they knew better than any other, that it concern'd not only his Inte|re&s;t, but al&s;o his Glory, not to &s;uffer all the Enterpri&s;es which <HI>France</HI> eve|ry day made again&s;t the Empire; yet as they made profe&s;&s;ion to take al|ways the &s;tronger &s;ide, it was alrea|dy &s;ome time that they had abandon|ed the Intere&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> on which Fortune had be|gun to turn her back, to embrace tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> to which &s;he appeared favourable.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to relate here all the Contentions they cau&s;ed in the Emperor's Court, to hinder the Ef|fect of the Re&s;olution he had taken,
<PB N="59" REF="32"> altho it would perhaps be a thing cu|rious enough to be known; but I &s;hall only &s;ay, That to retard the March of the Troops which were to join tho&s;e of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Bran|denburg,</HI> who had newly embraced the Defence of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they put into his Head, that he &s;hould no &s;ooner have diffurni&s;hed the Fronti|ers of <HI>Hungary,</HI> but the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had &s;ecret Intelligences there, would make u&s;e of the Opportunity, with|out regarding the Truce which was between the two Empires. And the Emperor being but a weak Prince, and di&s;po&s;ed to take the fir&s;t Impre&s;|&s;ions that were given him, this thought &s;ank &s;o deep in his mind, that altho he were not &s;o ignorant of the Affairs of the World, as not to &s;ee that the Marque&s;s of <HI>Branden|burg</HI> could do nothing without him, he cea&s;ed not to leave his Troops in their Quarters, while the Marque&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> at the Head of his went to &s;eek Honour and Glory.</P>

The King commanded one, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> another, and the Vi&s;count <HI>de Turenne</HI> the la&s;t: The fir&s;t was animated by the pre|&s;ence of the King; the &s;econd, by the Reputation of the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> and the third, by the Confi|dence they had in the Wi&s;dom of the Vi&s;count <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who was be&s;ides one of the greate&s;t Captains of his
<PB N="62" REF="34"> Time. But that which yet rendred all &s;orts of Enterpri&s;es more ea&s;y to the <HI>French,</HI> is, that they found no|body in the Field to make head a|gain&s;t them, and &s;o little Re&s;i&s;tance in the Towns, that it gave occa&s;ion to believe that they had Intelligence in the mo&s;t of them. For my part, I will not affirm that it was &s;o or not, but &s;hall only &s;ay, that there was a great pre&s;umption of it in what was done by <HI>Do&s;&s;ery,</HI> who comman|ded at <HI>Rhinberg,</HI> which he &s;urren|dred without expecting the Canon, altho there were above fifteen hun|dred Men in Garri&s;on, with good Officers enough to command them.</P>
<P>But if any thing were capable to give &s;u&s;picion of Intelligence, it was without doubt that which pa&s;&s;ed at the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> For if I will examine what was done by <HI>Mom|bas,</HI> who had Orders to repair thi|ther, and what he him&s;elf alledges for his own Ju&s;tification, I find him ab&s;olutely culpable, or at lea&s;t very ignorant in the My&s;tery of War. He &s;aith, That having received Orders
<PB N="63" REF="34"> from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to repair to <HI>Tolhus,</HI> he went thither with the few Troops he had given him, and expected there tho&s;e which were far|ther promi&s;ed him to defend the Pa&s;|&s;age; but that the&s;e Troops not co|ming, he well &s;aw that he had given him this Command only to de&s;troy him, which made him ask of tho&s;e Deputies of the States, who were joined with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that they would &s;end him to &s;ome o|ther place, where he might acquire greater Glory.</P>
<P>As for my own part, as I was pre|&s;ent at the Pa&s;&s;age, &s;o can I &s;carce &s;uffer my &s;elf to be told, that there needed many Men to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from pa&s;&s;ing. If the Squadron which march'd again&s;t the twenty, or five and twenty Cura&s;&s;iers, which pa&s;t fir&s;t, had put them&s;elves into the mid&s;t of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;taying, as they did, upon the Bank, there would have needed no more to keep the others from pa&s;&s;ing, who came as yet but in a &s;ingle File, one after a|nother: but having been &s;o impru|dent,
<PB N="64" REF="35"> or &s;o cowardly, as not to ad|vance any further, they gave the <HI>French,</HI> who were retired into the Water, Time to embody them|&s;elves, and then when they return'd again&s;t them, ran away.</P>
<P>Thus there is no rea&s;on for <HI>Mom|bas</HI> to &s;ay, that he had not Men e|now to defend the Pa&s;&s;age, &s;ince he had more than he needed, as I have now demon&s;trated. But let us grant him what he demands, and agree, as he will have it, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> gave him this Command to &s;troy him; what, doth he thence con|clude that he might retire as he did? What Souldier is there &s;o great a Novice in the Trade of War, as to be ignorant, that when a Gene|ral has once &s;ent him to a Po&s;t, he is obliged to keep it till &s;uch time as the General cau&s;es him to be relie|ved? For let not <HI>Mombas</HI> pretend to excu&s;e him&s;elf by the Order of the States Deputies. The States have Right to command the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI> who is their Captain-General; but it belongs to the Captain-General
<PB N="65" REF="35"> to command the Military Officers. And I do not believe, that a Deputy of the States would intermeddle to give a Command contrary to what the Captain-General has commanded; for &s;o he would expo&s;e him&s;elf, if he &s;hould addre&s;s to a Man that knows his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;ee his Command &s;lighted.</P>
<P>We may then hence conclude one of the&s;e three things: Fir&s;t; That <HI>Mombas</HI> having abandoned the <HI>Rhine,</HI> becau&s;e the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent him not the Reinforcement he had promi&s;ed him, was a Man without Courage or Experience: &s;ince Expe|rience would have taught him, that it required no great Number of Men to keep &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age as that; and had he been a Man of Courage, he would have de&s;pi&s;ed a little Danger to acquire a great Glory.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing that mu&s;t thence be inferred, is, That after he had been commanded by the Captain-General of the State to keep a Po&s;t of &s;o great importance, he mu&s;t be very ignorant in Military Affairs, to
<PB N="66" REF="36"> believe that he might quit it upon &s;ight of an Order, begg'd from and granted by a Per&s;on, who does not &s;o much as under&s;tand Martial Di&s;ci|pline, and whom the State &s;ends to give Order rather in Political than Military Affairs, wherein under&s;tand|ing nothing him&s;elf, he refers him|&s;elf to him in who&s;e hands the Com|mand of the Armies is entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The third Conclu&s;ion that is to be drawn thence, is, That if <HI>Mombas</HI> were neither cowardly, nor ignorant of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which, to do him a plea&s;ure, I am very willing to imagine, he was at: lea&s;t guilty of Trea&s;on. And what would incline one to be|lieve that there was &s;ome &s;uch thing in it, is, That he had the Winter before made a Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he &s;aw the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> altho I cannot find that he was known to him before; nor can I learn that he has had the honour to &s;ee him &s;ince, ex|cept when he made his E&s;cape from <HI>Nieurbruk;</HI> for Princes, as well as other Per&s;ons, have no great e&s;teem for Traytors.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="36">
<P>But let us pa&s;s over in &s;ilence a Campaign &s;o replete with De&s;olation and Mi&s;ery: And indeed the remem|brance of &s;o many fune&s;t Things can|not plea&s;e either one or other: For if, on the one &s;ide, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do not love to have the memory renewed of &s;o many inte&s;tine Di&s;cords; the <HI>French,</HI> on the other &s;ide, have no great rea&s;on to de&s;ire we &s;hould put them in mind of an infinite Number of Faults they committed at that time, and whereunto we are indebted for the &s;afety of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces.</HI> But we may here &s;ay, that this was the Work of GOD's Hand, who being plea&s;ed to &s;ave this State, &s;aved at the &s;ame time the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> In effect, there was none but GOD a|lone, who was capable to trouble the Judgment of the <HI>French</HI> to &s;uch a degree, as to commit the Faults they did: For we do not read in Hi&s;tory any thing like that which pa&s;s'd at <HI>Muiden,</HI> the taking whereof drew on that of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and that of <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> would have been accompanied with that of all the Seven Provinces:
<PB N="68" REF="37"> yet after that four of their Hor&s;e had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that Place, in&s;tead of putting a Garri&s;on therein, they &s;et them&s;elves to run a|bout plundring the Country; but perceiving then the Error they were guilty of, they would have returned to <HI>Muiden,</HI> whereof it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> having &s;ent Forces thither.</P>
<P>This Fault was attributed to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> Lieutenant-General, and Captain of the Life-Guard, who commanded the <HI>French</HI> in the Province of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and who had not much experience. In effect it was ob&s;erved, that as he was al|ways uncertain of what he ought to do, he made &s;ix thou&s;and Men take Hor&s;e, when there needed but two thou&s;and, and thus exceedingly tired his Troops, without drawing thence any Benefit: For as he was afraid of not &s;ucceeding, he cho&s;e rather to return very often without doing any thing, than to incur any Hazard. This Conduct made him be called by the Troops, <HI>The Peaceable General;</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="37"> but when he commanded not in chief, he was as enterpri&s;ing as another, what he did being only want of Ex|perience, and not of Courage.</P>
<P>The Over&s;ight at <HI>Muiden</HI> was the cau&s;e that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Rochefort</HI> was recalled from <HI>&V;trecht;</HI> but as he was one of the Kin&s;men and good Friends of Mr. <HI>de Louvois,</HI> he was not the more di&s;e&s;teemed for it at Court, the Government of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being on the contrary given to him. Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> was &s;ent in his place, a Man more known by the Cru|elties he committed in <HI>Holland,</HI> than by his great Exploits; not that I will deny him to be a very brave Man, but he was not much more knowing than Mr. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> which was al|ways known when he commanded a Body of above ten thou&s;and Men, for the re&s;t enterpri&s;ing, and therein very different from him in who&s;e place he came.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we are to know that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> having arre&s;ted <HI>Mombas</HI> on the &s;u&s;picion he had of his holding Intelligence with
<PB N="70" REF="38"> the Enemy, cau&s;ed his Proce&s;s to be made, and there was a great appea|rance that he would be made an Ex|ample to others; when <HI>Mombas,</HI> whe|ther he was con&s;cious of his own Guilt, as is probably believed, or that he had heard there is nothing &s;o &s;weet as Liberty, bethought him&s;elf of making his E&s;cape, by corrupting his Guards. The Hi&s;tory of his Flight is very agreeable and diverti|&s;ing, by rea&s;on of many Accidents which arrived therein; but &s;ince that makes nothing to my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall only &s;ay, That having traver&s;ed &s;ix Leagues always up to the Girdle in Water, and &s;ometimes higher, he got &s;afe to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and thence to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> where was the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> who had been wounded at the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> He &s;aw that Prince at four in the morning, &s;tayed with him above two hours, and retired from thence to <HI>Cologne.</HI> But let us make here a little reflection, and &s;ee whether this Interview, with all that followed it, be not an indu|bitable Proof of the Intelligence he
<PB N="71" REF="38"> held with the Enemies.</P>
<P>If <HI>Mombas</HI> had been faithful, how dur&s;t he, who ju&s;t came from bearing Arms again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> whereof he was born a Subject, put him&s;elf into the hands of the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;?</HI> Was there not rea&s;on to believe that he would cau&s;e him to be arre&s;ted? and that a Crown which prohibits its Subjects upon pain of Death from &s;erving of Strangers, would &s;hew it &s;elf much more &s;evere to him, who was not only refractory to this Ordi|nance, but had moreover &s;o lately drawn his Sword again&s;t it? I know well, he hath told &s;ome that he was &s;eized with this fear, and that it was for this rea&s;on he did not &s;tay at <HI>&V;|trecht;</HI> Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> whom he had cau&s;ed to be told that he was e|&s;caped from <HI>Nieuerbruk,</HI> and who&s;e Protection he had demanded, having an&s;wered, that he did not advi&s;e him to come into any Place where he had Command, becau&s;e he &s;hould be obliged to arre&s;t him.</P>
<P>But let us examine a little this Ar|ticle, and &s;ee whether it be not, as
<PB N="72" REF="39"> they &s;ay, to ca&s;t du&s;t in ones eyes, to talk on this manner. <HI>Mombas</HI> makes his E&s;cape to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> he enters there|into at open day, he traver&s;es the whole Town; he goes to lodge, as I take it, at the Palace-Royal, where he u&s;ed to lodge when the Town did not belong to the French; he cau&s;es the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> to be told that he was e&s;caped, he asks his Protecti|on: and yet he would have us be|lieve, that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> knew not he was there, but that ha|ving &s;ent him word he &s;hould have a care of coming thither, he was obli|ged to go to <HI>Arnhem.</HI> Let us rather &s;ay, that &s;ince it was the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> who had been concerned in all things the foregoing Winter, Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> believing that it &s;till belonged to him to meddle in it, was very glad that <HI>Mombas</HI> &s;hould ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf directly to him, not but that he him&s;elf would have been very willing to have had a part in this Intrigue, but becau&s;e he feared this might offend the Prince, in who&s;e good opinion it was his Intere&s;t to keep him&s;elf.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="39">
<P>But let us pro&s;ecute a little this Affair, and &s;ee whether there be any appearance to &s;ay that <HI>Mombas</HI> was innocent. He &s;eeks out the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> &s;ends him word by <HI>De&s;|roches,</HI> Captain of his Guards, that he &s;hould be very glad of the Honour to &s;peak with him, and, in one word, puts him&s;elf into his hands, whereas he ought to have &s;tood more upon his Guard, after the Adverti&s;ement he had received from Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg.</HI> In the mean time, as if the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had not had the &s;ame mea&s;ures to keep as the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> he &s;ees him, di&s;cour&s;es familiarly with him of all things, and after he had promi&s;ed him his Protection, coun&s;elled him to retire to <HI>Cologne,</HI> till &s;uch time as he could incline the King to pardon him.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hould willingly ask <HI>Mom|bas,</HI> Whether he be him&s;elf &s;o much a Fool, as to think others &s;illy enough to give credit to his Words? In ef|fect, how can it be imagined, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> would not only have &s;een him, but al&s;o coun&s;elled
<PB N="74" REF="40"> him to retire to <HI>Cologne,</HI> if he had not done this by agreement with the Court, who were very willing not to have it believed, that all the hap|py Succe&s;s they had in <HI>Holland</HI> was an Effect of the &s;ecret Intelligence they held with <HI>Mombas?</HI> For otherwi&s;e, in what hazard would the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> have put him&s;elf, who would not have failed to be taxed, for ha|ving not only &s;een a Man that was pro&s;cribed, but having al&s;o taught him a Place of Retreat? From all this, let us conclude, that <HI>Mombas</HI> was truly culpable; but let us at the &s;ame time add, that there were ma|ny others &s;o as well as he: which gave him the facility of making his E&s;cape from <HI>Nieurbruk,</HI> the&s;e other Per&s;ons having for that purpo&s;e made u&s;e of all that was in their power, for fear he &s;hould accu&s;e them al&s;o, when he &s;hould once &s;ee him&s;elf upon the Scaffold.</P>
<P>In the mean time he was not left long at <HI>Cologne;</HI> for &s;ince they be|lieved they had done enough to &s;alve the Appearances; by divulging that
<PB N="75" REF="40"> he had been obliged to make his E|&s;cape a great way off, he was &s;oon called back, and had Orders to go to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> Who howe|ver te&s;tified no great confidence in him. He was, notwith&s;tanding, very a&s;&s;iduous in courting him, and offered to do him &s;ervice even in the mo&s;t vile and abject things; and it was not long of him, had they been wil|ling to give but the lea&s;t credit to what he &s;aid, that he was not belie|ved to be a Man of great Impor|tance. In fine, he had not taken &s;o much care before to hide his Trea&s;on, but that he gloried as much then in making it appear. He asked Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> to give him two thou&s;and Men, to go and attack the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> at <HI>Nieuerbruk,</HI> vaunting, that he would traver&s;e all the Inundation which was between <HI>Wordes</HI> and that Town, and would thus &s;urprize him in the Rear, whil&s;t Mr. <HI>de Luxem|burg</HI> &s;hould on his &s;ide attack him in the Front: But Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> who be&s;ides that he believed him no great Captain, had not confidence e|nough
<PB N="76" REF="41"> in him to give him thus two thou&s;and Men, endeavoured to abate his warlike Sallies; whereat he &s;o much the more wondred, as that they began to take him at the age of five and fifty years.</P>
<P>Some time after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> re&s;olved to be&s;iege <HI>Wordes,</HI> at the taking whereof the French had in cold Blood kill'd the Bayliff, who had advanced to &s;hut the Gates again&s;t them. This Enterpri&s;e was conducted with a great deal of Pru|dence, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> having &s;urprized the Vigilance of the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who had taken the Field to put Troops therein; but &s;ince the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> knew not whether it were not <HI>Naerden,</HI> at which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> aimed, becau&s;e he had taken the way thither, he turned towards that Town; and whil&s;t he was going thither, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> inve&s;ted <HI>Wordes,</HI> and &s;etled his Quarters there. I re|late this Affair rather than many o|thers, becau&s;e therein an Adventure befell <HI>Mombas,</HI> which will &s;hew in
<PB N="77" REF="41"> what e&s;teem he was in the mind of the <HI>French,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Hol|landers.</HI> Before the Duke of <HI>Luxem|burg</HI> knew that <HI>Wordes</HI> was be&s;ieged, he re&s;olved to &s;uccour it, altho the thing appeared difficult, for two rea|&s;ons: The fir&s;t, becau&s;e he had but few Men with him; the other, be|cau&s;e the way to go thither was very &s;trait, and be&s;ides, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had already retrench'd them&s;elves at the Head thereof. In the mean time, as he wanted not Boldne&s;s, he re&s;olved to give &s;omething to Fortune. For this purpo&s;e he detached the Marque&s;s <HI>de Genlis,</HI> Mare&s;chal de Camp, to draw together from the Neighbouring Quarters the mo&s;t Troops he po&s;&s;ibly could; and having appointed him Time and Place for a Rendezvous, he went thither, where for a long time he expected the Marque&s;s <HI>de Genlis,</HI> without &s;eeing him come. As there needed no great matter to make him &s;wear, he took occa&s;ion from thence to take into his mouth he Name of GOD, of whom he did
<PB N="78" REF="42"> not often otherwi&s;e &s;peak; he an hundred times reviled the Marque&s;s <HI>de Genlis,</HI> threatning aloud to ruine him at Court; and not daring to accu&s;e him of Cowardi&s;e, becau&s;e there were many Per&s;ons who would have &s;ecretly given him the Lie, he accu&s;ed him of holding Intelligence with the Enemy, but in covert and un|certain Words, whereunto no-body would an&s;wer, becau&s;e they well &s;aw from what Spirit this proceeded. In fine, when he had vented his Choler in abundance of Injuries and Bla&s;phe|mies, he a&s;&s;embled a little Council of War, compo&s;ed of the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> the Marque&s;s de <HI>Ca&s;telnau,</HI> the Count <HI>de Milly,</HI> the Cadet <HI>Scoupe,</HI> and <HI>Mom|bas:</HI> This, as being capable to be the Geographer of the Country, wherein he had lived above twenty Years; tho&s;e, as Per&s;ons fit not on|ly to give Coun&s;el, but al&s;o to exe|cute the Coun&s;el they &s;hould have gi|ven. There it was propo&s;ed what was to be done; whether it were more expedient to pa&s;s on further, or to retire, whereunto the Duke of
<PB N="79" REF="42"> <HI>Luxemburg</HI> &s;eemed to incline, becau&s;e <HI>Genlis</HI> had failed of his Word. As this Council was wholly compo&s;ed of young Men, except <HI>Mombas,</HI> they were all of opinion to go on, and <HI>Mombas</HI> conformed him&s;elf to their Sentiment, becau&s;e that he would have been alone of his own. Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, the Count <HI>de la Mark,</HI> Camp-Ma&s;ter of the Regi|ment of <HI>Picardy,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Wordes,</HI> di&s;patch'd a Man to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> with Letters, whereby he informed him, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had already rai&s;ed two Forts at the Head of the Inun|dation, whereof the one was guard|ed by the Count <HI>de Horne,</HI> General of the Artillery; and the other by <HI>Zuile&s;tein,</HI> General of the Foot: And &s;ince the Succour mu&s;t arrive by one of the&s;e two ways, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> ask'd <HI>Mombas,</HI> With which he thought it would be be&s;t dealing, whether with the Count <HI>de Horne,</HI> or <HI>Zuile&s;tein? Mombas,</HI> glad that he could &s;peak, which did not very often befall him, told the Duke of <HI>Luxem|burg,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="43"> that it was his Advice to attack <HI>Zuile&s;tein,</HI> becau&s;e he would &s;ome|times drink hard, and did not &s;tand &s;o much upon his Guard as the Count <HI>de Horne</HI> might, who did not &s;leep, but was always upon the Watch.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> having re&s;olved to follow this Coun&s;el, not that he grounded him&s;elf upon what <HI>Mombas</HI> had told him, but becau&s;e it was indifferent to him to attack <HI>Horne</HI> or <HI>Zuile&s;tein,</HI> march'd his Troops up|on the Cau&s;ey which goes from <HI>&V;|trecht</HI> to <HI>Wordes,</HI> having the Canal of <HI>Wordes</HI> on the one hand, and the Meadows on the other, but which wholly re&s;embled a Sea, becau&s;e they had already for &s;ome time been all under Water. When he was about half a League from the Enemy, he made an halt to &s;end to view the Place, before he engaged any farther. Every one expected, that <HI>Mombas</HI> would ask to go thither, as well to give Marks of his Courage, as to &s;hew his Zeal to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg:</HI> but whether he feared that he would not put confidence enough in him,
<PB N="81" REF="43"> to refer him&s;elf to what he &s;hould &s;ay; or whether he were not willing to en|gage him&s;elf as a private Souldier, he let this Employ be taken by two Ser|geants, who were named by the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> and for who&s;e Bra|very and Fidelity he an&s;wered to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Souldiers by favour of the Night advanced within Musket-&s;hot of the Fort of <HI>Zuile&s;tein;</HI> but well knowing that unle&s;s they got farther, they could not give any certain Ac|count of what was de&s;ired to be known, they ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Inundation, one on one &s;ide, and the other on the other &s;ide; and making the lea&s;t Noi&s;e they po&s;&s;ibly could, for fear of being di&s;cover'd they re|mark'd that there was a Mill before the Fort, where they had &s;ome Re|trenchments, and had put &s;ome Pali|zadoes; that in the Inundation there was an Hou&s;e, wherein they had placed &s;ome Musquetiers, which flank|ed the Fort, that when the Enemies &s;hould go to the Attack, they might thence kill them many Men: In fine,
<PB N="82" REF="44"> that the Fort was of Earth, but well palizadoed with a Ditch before, and Cannon; &s;o that tho they had not much time to put it in condition, there was appearance neverthele&s;s that they would make good re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>After the two Sergeants had rela|ted what I have ju&s;t now told you, Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> fore&s;eeing that they would kill him many Men from the Hou&s;e, which was in the mid&s;t of the Inundation, re&s;olv'd to cau&s;e it to be attack'd, and al&s;o went thither him&s;elf to animate the Souldiers by his Pre&s;ence. In the mean time he made a Detachment to march again&s;t the Mill, and having appointed Men to &s;upport it, he commanded tho&s;e that were near him to go into the In|undation, to &s;hew the way to the Troops. <HI>Mombas</HI> being one of the fir&s;t that entred into it, had not gone above five or &s;ix &s;teps, when he called out to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> that there was not much Water, and that he might &s;ecurely come in. Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> believed him, but having a moment after made a fal&s;e Step,
<PB N="83" REF="44"> every one began to cry out that <HI>Mombas</HI> was a Traitor; and that af|ter he had betrayed the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> among&s;t whom he dur&s;t no longer &s;hew his Head, he endeavoured to regain their Favour, by de&s;troying the Troops of <HI>France</HI> with their Ge|neral. To the&s;e Reproaches were added Threats, and to the Threats al&s;o &s;ome Blows; &s;o that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> not being able to re|move this Impre&s;&s;ion out of their Minds, which were &s;trongly &s;eized therewith, gave command to <HI>Mom|bas</HI> to retire near him; but as he would not entirely ruine his Honour, he took a Pretext of &s;ending him to carry Orders to the Troops which marched again&s;t the Mill: after which he continued his way under a|nother Guide.</P>
<P>The Minds of the Souldiers being by this means quieted, every one continued to march in the Rank wherein he had been put; and the Hou&s;e being attack'd at the &s;ame time with the Mill, tho&s;e that were within, were hindred from thinking
<PB N="84" REF="45"> to take the Enemy in the Flank, to provide for their own Defence. The Re&s;i&s;tance was great both in the Mill and in the Fort; but the <HI>French</HI> ha|ving attack'd them &s;o much the more vigorou&s;ly, took both the one and the other, and &s;et them on fire, to the end, as I believe, they might have the plea&s;ure of hearing it &s;aid, that they had not only &s;urmounted the Waters by their Courage, but tri|umphed al&s;o over that Element by a contrary. However it were, it was notwith&s;tanding a thing which co&s;t them dear: for <HI>Zuile&s;tein</HI>'s Men, who had till that time &s;hot at random, having then the Flame which &s;erved them for a Guide, &s;carce made any Shot afterwards which had not effect, e&s;pecially the Cannoniers, who hence|forward charged only with Cart|ridges. This began to put the Ene|my in great di&s;order, and in fine, it was to be believed, that they would not only have been rebutted thereby, but al&s;o forced to betake them&s;elves to flight, had not Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> come to rea&s;&s;ure them; he put him|&s;elf
<PB N="85" REF="45"> at their Head, and having en|couraged them by his Example, every one ob&s;erved him as if nothing had happened. <HI>Milly,</HI> who had the Vant-Guard, with the Regiment of <HI>Nor|mandy,</HI> whereof he was Colonel, ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Retrenchments of <HI>Zuile&s;tein</HI> with abundance of Cou|rage; but as he endeavoured to break a Palizado, that he might get farther, he received a Shot in the Thigh, whereof he died a &s;hort time after. The Misfortune of <HI>Milly</HI> did not at all a&s;toni&s;h tho&s;e that were commanded to &s;econd him; but ha|ving broken the Palizadoes, they took the Fort by A&s;&s;ault, in the defence whereof <HI>Zuile&s;tein</HI> lo&s;t his Life, after he had done all that could be expected from a gallant Man. <HI>Mom|bas</HI> would vaunt that it was he who kill'd him, becau&s;e he believ'd what pa&s;&s;ed during the Night could not have been ob&s;erved; but the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> who had to do with him, te&s;tified, that it was a Sergeant of his Regiment to whom al&s;o he held him&s;elf obliged, not knowing what
<PB N="86" REF="46"> I&s;&s;ue he &s;hould have had of that Af|fair, if he had not come to his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Wordes</HI> relieved with much reputation to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> but with little &s;atisfaction to abun|dance of Officers, who &s;ignalized them&s;elves there, and among&s;t others to the Count <HI>de Milly:</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> having forgotten, whe|ther through De&s;ign or Chance, to &s;peak of him in the particular Ac|count he &s;ent to the King. <HI>Milly</HI> was &s;o di&s;contented thereat, that his Wound, which was already but too dangerous, grew daily wor&s;e and wor&s;e; he told all tho&s;e that came to &s;ee him, that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> had ruined his Honour for his whole Life; and that his Life being thus a Burthen to him, the mo&s;t favourable thing that could befall him was to die quickly. The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> ha|ving knowledg of the&s;e things by &s;ome-body that &s;ent him word there|of, writ at the &s;ame time to <HI>Milly,</HI> for whom he had a great e&s;teem, That he was to blame, to lay &s;o much
<PB N="87" REF="46"> to heart a thing which the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> had done without de&s;ign; that all <HI>France</HI> was per&s;uaded of his Gallantry; and that he was him&s;elf ready to render account thereof to the whole World, as having often &s;een him manife&s;t it upon occa&s;ions. <HI>Milly</HI> read this Letter with incredible Joy, told every one that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had re&s;tored him his Honour, and thru&s;ting it between his two Night-caps, &s;uffered it not to be ta|ken from him, till he had given up the Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>I had moreover forgotten to men|tion a thing which happened at the Relief of <HI>Wordes,</HI> and which &s;hews how little di&s;tance there is &s;ometimes between Victory and Defeat. After the taking of the Fort of <HI>Zuile&s;tein,</HI> there was a certain Report &s;pread a|mong the <HI>French,</HI> that there was yet another Fort between <HI>Wordes</HI> and the Army; and there appeared &s;o great a Con&s;ternation thereat among&s;t the Souldiers, that every one demanded rather to return than to go any far|ther. The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> him|&s;elf,
<PB N="88" REF="47"> not over-well knowing what he had to do, con&s;ulted the principal Officers of his Army; and they ha|ving declared to him that nothing was to be precipitated, before they were &s;ure of what they apprehended, made him re&s;olve to &s;end to know the Truth. The Duke of <HI>Luxem|burg</HI> cho&s;e for this purpo&s;e a Per&s;on that I could ea&s;ily name if I would, in whom he had very great confidence, but who neverthele&s;s an&s;wered not what every one expected of him; for having met in the way with <HI>la Palme,</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Regiment of the Marine, whom the Count <HI>de Horne</HI> &s;ent to a&s;|&s;i&s;t <HI>Zuile&s;tein,</HI> not yet knowing that he had lo&s;t both his Fort and his Life, he cowardly turned back, and came to tell the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> that all that had been told him was true, that there was yet another Fort, and that he could not arrive at <HI>Wordes,</HI> without taking that fir&s;t. One can|not imagine the Terror that he &s;truck into the Troops by this News, which &s;o well confirmed what they already
<PB N="89" REF="47"> apprehended. The Duke of <HI>Luxem|burg</HI> thereupon a&s;&s;embled the Coun|cil of War, and every one was of opinion to hazard nothing more, whereon the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> him|&s;elf concluded, well knowing that he could lay all the Fault upon the Mar|que&s;s de <HI>Genlis,</HI> for not keeping his Word with him. But as they were upon the point to execute this Re&s;o|lution, two Hor&s;emen, whom the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> had detached to know what hindred the Succour from entring the Town, arrived from <HI>Wordes,</HI> and quieted their Minds, by the a&s;&s;urance they gave them, that this new Fort was but a Ca&s;tle in the Air. Every one after this no longer doubting, they began to &s;peak ill of him that had been &s;ent to &s;earch into it; but he having the Protection of Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> this pa&s;s'd not the Camp, and the General took no care to give the Court advice thereof, which would have cau&s;ed this Officer to be ca&s;hier'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> dealt not in the &s;ame manner with Mr. <HI>de Genlis,</HI> who
<PB N="90" REF="48"> was exiled; but as he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf upon the Impo&s;&s;ibility of getting his Troops together in &s;o &s;hort a time as Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> had a&s;&s;igned him, his Exile la&s;ted not long, and he &s;erved again &s;oon after as if no|thing had been.</P>
<P>But let us pa&s;s over in &s;ilence &s;o many other Evenements, wherein Fortune was &s;ometimes favourable, and &s;ometimes contrary to the <HI>French,</HI> let us &s;ay only, That their Conduct was &s;o pitiful, that altho they entred into the Field with an Army of above Six&s;core Thou&s;and Men, and had not lo&s;t above Two Thou&s;and of them, their Forces were neverthele&s;s &s;o &s;eparated by rea&s;on of their gree|dine&s;s to keep their Conque&s;ts, that this opened the way to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to reconquer their Country, were they but never &s;o little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e that animated them to do &s;omething that might be glori|ous, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hewed them|&s;elves mo&s;t affectionate, not only through the Antipathy they naturally
<PB N="91" REF="48"> have again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> but al&s;o through the In&s;ults they daily recei|ved from them: For their Armies encamped indifferently upon the Ter|ritories of <HI>Spain,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> their Commanders not being concerned at their giving occa|&s;ion of Complaint to a Nation, which they e&s;teemed feeble, and not in con|dition to re&s;ent it. The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who by the Death of <HI>de VVitt,</HI> &s;acrificed by the People, that imputed to him all the Misfortunes which were come upon the State, had been elevated to a &s;upreme Gran|dure, &s;ought nothing on his &s;ide, but to keep up by &s;ome great Action the E&s;teem the People had conceived of his Per&s;on. For this purpo&s;e he pre&s;s'd the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> Go|vernor of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> to declare him&s;elf; but he &s;till re|coiled back, whether he was di&s;tru&s;t|ful of the Succe&s;s, or rather becau&s;e they could not agree together on what &s;ide to turn their Arms, each of them de&s;iring that it &s;hould be on that &s;ide which was favourable to
<PB N="92" REF="49"> them&s;elves. In the mean while, &s;ince it was of con&s;equence not to lo&s;e Time, which is never recovered, and e&s;pecially in War, where there needs but one only moment to change all, they agreed at the la&s;t to attack <HI>Char|leroy,</HI> which was advantagious both to the one and the other: becau&s;e that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by that means delivered them&s;elves from a Place, which gives the <HI>French</HI> entrance into their Country; the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> on their &s;ide, &s;ecured their Frontiers, which could not be attack'd, if they once made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that Place, becau&s;e it was there that the Enemies made all their Magazines, and a&s;&s;embled all their Convoys. Thereby al&s;o they might hope, that they &s;hould not only thenceforward have more facility to make War, but al&s;o that the <HI>French</HI> would be ob|liged to abandon their Conque&s;ts, be|cau&s;e that not having any longer the means to lay Siege to <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> without which they could not proba|bly hope to make &s;o many Places &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, all the&s;e Places would be lo&s;t of
<PB N="93" REF="49"> them&s;elves, the Country not being &s;ufficient to furni&s;h them with Ne|ce&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Things being with &s;o much pru|dence, as it &s;eemed, concerted, there remained nothing more but to exe|cute them with di&s;cretion, which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did on his &s;ide; but there was much to be &s;aid, that he was not &s;econded by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as he ought, and they had promi&s;ed him. Neverthele&s;s, for his own part, after he had &s;pread a Report in his Army, that he would go to <HI>Tongres,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;eik,</HI> for to di&s;ingage <HI>Mae|&s;tricht,</HI> which was block'd up by the means of the&s;e two Places above and below the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> (for tho <HI>Tongres</HI> be not upon this River, yet &s;ince it is not far from it, it wrought the &s;ame Effect as if it had been thereon) he obliged <HI>Montal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> to put him&s;elf into <HI>Ton|gres,</HI> after which he marched again&s;t <HI>Charleroy,</HI> which was de&s;titute of the pre&s;ence of its Governor, and where|in be&s;ides there was but a very weak Garri&s;on.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="50">
<P>The Surprize of <HI>France</HI> was extra|ordinary at this Rencounter. This &s;eemed to her not to be the E&s;&s;ay of a young Prince, who could not yet have much Experience, but on the contrary, the Ma&s;ter-Stroke of a Captain grown perfect in the Trade. In the mean time, as the Lo&s;s of this Place would draw with it &s;trange Con&s;equences for her, be&s;ides that &s;he gave Order to all the Garri&s;ons thereabout to march &s;peedily to its Relief, all the Gallants of the Court took Po&s;t to have their part in the Glory. But there was no need for their making &s;o much ha&s;te, all the Succe&s;s of the Affair could con&s;i&s;t on|ly in an extraordinay Diligence, which &s;hould have obliged the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> that were upon the Place, to have had all things ready for the Siege. But as they are naturally &s;low, the Cannon arrived not till two days after the Place was inve&s;ted; &s;o that having thereby given time to the Troops to draw together, and to <HI>Montal</HI> to get into the Town, they were forced to rai&s;e the Siege, and
<PB N="95" REF="50"> to carry away as much Shame from this Enterprize, as there was Honour to be gotten by it.</P>
<P>From this time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;aw how little ground there was to build any thing upon the Word of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have &s;ince conti|nued to do always the &s;ame thing: For do we not know, that in all the Fights wherein they have been found, they rather brought Di&s;order than Succour? Were they not found at the Battel of <HI>Senef,</HI> pillaging the Baggage of their Allies? and were they not obliged to hang a very &s;uffi|cient Number of them to give Exam|ple unto others? But that wherein their Weakne&s;s wholly appeared, was in the Excu&s;es they made to <HI>France,</HI> immediately after the unhap|py Succe&s;s of the Siege of <HI>Charleroy;</HI> for the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> not only di&s;avowed the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> but offered al&s;o to recall him from his Government, for to appea&s;e <HI>France,</HI> which made a great Noi&s;e for his ha|ving thus dared to take Arms. In the mean time, they would not have the
<PB N="96" REF="51"> <HI>Spaniards</HI> think of repelling Force by Force, which it was neverthele&s;s to little purpo&s;e for them to do, there being &s;uch a Malediction upon them, that they &s;eem to bring Misfortune upon tho&s;e that take their part.</P>
<P>In the time that all this pa&s;s'd, Mr. <HI>de Brandenburg</HI> was at the Head of his Army, five and twenty thou|&s;and &s;trong, always expecting that the Emperor would bring his into the Field, which was held for mo&s;t certain, after he had &s;o &s;olemnly ta|ken the Re&s;olution to do it in the Pilgrimage of <HI>Marienzel:</HI> But he was very much &s;urprized to under|&s;tand that this Prince had changed his Sentiment, being prevented by the &s;trong Alarms given by the Je|&s;uits, who had, as I have already &s;aid, but too much power over his Mind. This then obliged the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> on his &s;ide to think of making his Accommoda|tion with <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Forces were &s;uperior to his. He could not pro|bably flatter him&s;elf with the hopes of an happy Succe&s;s, when tho&s;e who
<PB N="97" REF="51"> had mo&s;t powerfully excited him to take Arms, thus turned their back upon him: for altho he had been at fir&s;t &s;ollicited thereunto by the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in &s;uch manner joined her &s;elf to their Solll|citations, that one would have &s;aid, that her own Intere&s;ts were more con|cerned therein than the Intere&s;t of her Neighbours. Which, in the mean time, afforded great matter of Admi|ration to tho&s;e who made reflection on pa&s;t and pre&s;ent things; for they were wholly a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee, that a Nation which had &s;o far hated ano|ther, as &s;everal times to have cau&s;ed the Heads thereof to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, &s;hould be &s;o much changed, that &s;he &s;hould her &s;elf go to &s;eek A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Courts of Princes, for tho&s;e whom &s;he had by all manner of ways endeavoured to oppre&s;s. But if they had occa&s;ion to be at that time a&s;to|ni&s;hed, they would have much more to be &s;o now, in &s;eeing what at pre|&s;ent pa&s;&s;es: For if we will make but never &s;o little Reflection on the Con|duct of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is it not an
<PB N="98" REF="52"> amazing thing, that they &s;hould be obliged at this day to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to whom they had &s;o often &s;erved for Executioners; and that after having &s;o many times in vain endeavoured to exterminate them, they &s;hould at pre&s;ent be con|&s;trained to acknowledg, that they &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by their Succour? In ef|fect, there is not any one &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee that it is the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to whom the Safety of <HI>Flanders</HI> is at this day due, and that, were it not for them, the <HI>French</HI> had long &s;ince made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters thereof.</P>
<P>The Accommodation of the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> with <HI>France</HI> was none of the mo&s;t difficult to make: For &s;ince <HI>France</HI> demanded nothing, but that none &s;hould concern them|&s;elves with the Affairs of the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI> &s;he gave order to Mr. <HI>de Tu|renne,</HI> who lay a little hard upon <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> to leave him in repo&s;e, on condition, as he offered, to conti|nue Neuter during the War, provi|ded the Places were re&s;tored to him, which <HI>France</HI> held from him in the
<PB N="99" REF="52"> Dutchy of <HI>Cleves,</HI> as <HI>We&s;el,</HI> and &s;ome other Places of le&s;s importance. This Accommodation being made upon the&s;e Conditions, Mr. <HI>de Brandenburg</HI> retired into his own Dominions, and Mr. <HI>de Turenne</HI> on this &s;ide the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>It thereby &s;eemed that all &s;ort of Succour was forbid the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But as it often happens, that Things produce Effects wholly contrary to tho&s;e for which they were done; &s;o it happened, that what &s;hould have ha&s;t|ned the Ruine of the <HI>&V;nited Provin|ces,</HI> was what ha&s;tened their Pre&s;er|vation: For <HI>France,</HI> to &s;ecure her &s;elf for the future from &s;uch like Enterprizes, no longer kept any mea&s;ure with any Prince of the Em|pire. She &s;eized upon <HI>Treves</HI> and <HI>Bonn;</HI> and tho the Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> &s;eemed to con&s;ent to the Inva&s;ion of the la&s;t Place, it was neverthele&s;s known that he was forced thereunto; and that if the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strasburg</HI> had not had &s;o much power over him, he had perhaps taken Re&s;olutions more worthy his Birth, and more
<PB N="100" REF="53"> conformable to his Intere&s;ts. How|ever it were, all the Princes of the Empire excited one another no longer to &s;uffer <HI>France</HI> to encroach upon their Liberty. Only Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken before, who was married to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having a great Influence over the Spirit of her Husband, and withal remembring the Amity which the <HI>French</HI> King had heretofore te&s;ti|fied to her, was very glad to &s;hew him &s;ome Marks of her Acknowledg|ment upon this occa&s;ion; for &s;he hin|dred <HI>Bavaria</HI> from entring into the League which was forming again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> on condition neverthele&s;s that the Dauphin &s;hould marry her Daughter.</P>
<P>This League made the Affairs of the <HI>French</HI> change their Face. The Emperor, pre&s;s'd by &s;o many Prin|ces, made him&s;elf Head of this League. And as <HI>Brandenburg</HI> had not made his Treaty, but that he &s;aw him&s;elf abandoned by every Body; &s;o he no &s;ooner &s;aw that all the re&s;t entred into the Li&s;ts again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> but he
<PB N="101" REF="53"> him&s;elf re&s;olved al&s;o to make one a|mong&s;t them.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t Objects of this League's Arms was the Siege of <HI>Bonne,</HI> by the Conque&s;t whereof not only <HI>Germany</HI> was delivered from French Slavery, but al&s;o the Towns which that Crown had the foregoing Cam|paign gotten from the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> For as they received thereby both Ammunition and Victuals, which they could not have by the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held <HI>Charlemont</HI> and <HI>Namur,</HI> they were forced to think of abandoning them, and that before the Army of the Allies, which was numerous, &s;hould &s;eize on the Pa&s;&s;ages, and thereby hinder the re|turn of the Garri&s;ons. Mr. <HI>de Lux|emburg,</HI> who was the farthe&s;t in the Country, where he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf by unheard of Cruelties, e&s;|pecially at the taking of <HI>Suammerdam</HI> and <HI>Bodegrave,</HI> was the fir&s;t who re|ceived Orders to retire. He &s;peedily obeyed them, well knowing, that being &s;o hated of the People as he was, it would not be &s;ecure for him
<PB N="102" REF="54"> to &s;tay there, if Fortune were once contrary to <HI>France.</HI> But the Mare&s;cal <HI>de Bellefonds,</HI> having &s;hewn him&s;elf a little more &s;tiff, becau&s;e he thought this Command not conformable to the King's Intere&s;ts, de&s;erv'd to be exiled for offering to penetrate far|ther into the matter than they would have him.</P>
<P>The&s;e happy Succe&s;&s;es were ballan|ced by the Lo&s;s which the Allies made of the Town of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and of <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;,</HI> a Province appertain|ing to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were al&s;o entred into the League, but had not made it much &s;tronger thereby: for they had neither Forces nor Di&s;ci|pline, and yet their Vanity went &s;o far, as to de&s;ire to be e&s;teemed the Soul of the Party; but if it had been &s;o, it would have been a Party, who&s;e Soul was upon its Lips ju&s;t rea|dy to depart.</P>
<P>I will not, as I have already &s;aid, relate all the different Succe&s;&s;es of the War: for be&s;ides that it would be to engage my &s;elf in a Labour which I &s;hould never get out of with honour,
<PB N="103" REF="54"> for the Rea&s;ons I have before alledg|ed, what u&s;e would it be of to this Work, the Aim whereof is only to &s;hew the Enterprizes and In&s;incerity of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince her a&s;piring to the Univer&s;al Monarchy? I &s;hall &s;ay neverthele&s;s by the way, That if &s;he had more Felicity than Infelicity, during the cour&s;e of this War, it was becau&s;e our Union was an ill-united Union, every Prince minding his own particular Intere&s;ts, and little caring for the common Intere&s;t.</P>

<PB N="104" REF="55"> where they might have made Inroads when they would. Thereby they would have obliged the Enemies to keep a great Army in the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and they would have fed upon them&s;elves, whereas they ate up the Allies, who were obliged, as we &s;ay, to lay the Cloth for them, the Emperor by his Authority cau&s;ing the War to be carried into <HI>Al&s;atia;</HI> for through the &s;ame Rea&s;ons per|haps, which are ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd, and not nece&s;&s;ary to be here related, that inclined the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to de|&s;ire that the War &s;hould be made in his Country, the Emperor de&s;ired they &s;hould conquer <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> which was a Fief of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that had been yielded to <HI>France</HI> by the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> However it were, Experience &s;hewed, that what|ever pro&s;pect the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> might have therein, he &s;till rea&s;oned like a great Captain; whereas the Emperor rea&s;oned neither like a Cap|tain nor Politician: For at lea&s;t, when he carried the War on another &s;ide, he ought to have a&s;&s;ured him|&s;elf

<P>The Lo&s;s of this fair Province drew after it very pernicious Con&s;e|quences: For the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who &s;aw that he had thereby lo&s;t all hopes of ever re-entring into his Country, entirely detached him&s;elf from the Party, I mean as to his In|clination, for to outward appearance he continued &s;till with them, not knowing perhaps whither to go for to be better: And certainly I &s;hall hereupon relate things, which every one perhaps doth not &s;o well know as my &s;elf.

<P>Now tho all the&s;e Conditions did not any way plea&s;e <HI>France,</HI> &s;he cea|&s;ed not to hearken to the &s;ecret En|voy of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> as if &s;he had an Inclination to favour his Ma&s;ter; &s;he an&s;wered him, That &s;he was glad to &s;ee that he was re-entred into his true Intere&s;ts, but that, for certain Con&s;iderations, it was impo&s;|&s;ible for her at pre&s;ent to hearken to his Offers: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he had a care of his Honour, which tho&s;e that envied him would not fail to blemi&s;h, if in the height of the War,

Now they would not wholly break with him, by rejecting his Propo&s;itions, which were altogether ridiculous, con&s;ide|ring the State wherein things then were; nor yet entirely rebut him: for by rebutting him, they &s;hould make him an irreconcileable Enemy, which was not agreeable to Policy, becau&s;e they knew not in what man|ner things might turn. And by ac|commodating with him, they would have done them&s;elves a notable Preju|dice, for many rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e if he was once retired into <HI>France,</HI> he was a Spirit capable to excite the People to Sedition, and
<PB N="108" REF="57"> put him&s;elf at their Head, which was more to be feared by the Court, than whatever el&s;e could befall them. Se|condly, Becau&s;e they pretended to hold commerce with him, and by that means di&s;cover all that pa&s;s'd in the Army of the Allies. And in fine, becau&s;e being &s;u&s;pected, as he already was, by his own Party, where he thought nothing well done, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Lo&s;s of <HI>Franche Comte,</HI> he created there Di&s;tru&s;ts and Jealou&s;ies among&s;t the Princes, to whom he did not cea&s;e to remon&s;trate, that the War was not made for them, but for the Emperor; that he &s;pake not for his own Intere&s;t, altho what was be|fallen him, was &s;ufficient enough to render them wi&s;e at his Co&s;ts; but let them con&s;ider only in what man|ner the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was treated, who thinking to remove the War from his Country, had quitted the Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> for to enter in|to their Union; that he was eaten up by the one and the other, per&s;ecuted by the Garri&s;on of <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> with|out having been able thitherto to

<P>As <HI>France</HI> therefore well knew what his Di&s;content was capable to produce, &s;he would not conclude any thing with him, but entertained him however with fair hopes. Some time after arrived the Affair of <HI>Treves,</HI> I mean the routing of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi,</HI> which rai&s;ed the Affairs of the Confederates to &s;o high a pitch, that they &s;eemed as if they were a|bout to penetrate even into the Heart of <HI>France.</HI> But he that had cau&s;ed the Evil, &s;oon brought the Remedy,
<PB N="110" REF="58"> I mean the Duke of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> For after he had gained the Battel, and &s;aid before every Body, that it was now that he would go as far as <HI>Paris,</HI> a &s;ecret Interpo&s;er from <HI>France,</HI> who re&s;ided in <HI>Treves,</HI> that he might up|on occa&s;ion be near him, being intro|duced unto him by <HI>Cevillette,</HI> who was but ju&s;t delivered out of the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> with whom he had been Pri&s;oner, whether by chance or upon de&s;ign, beat down all the&s;e fair Re&s;olutions with Bills of Exchange for two hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which were paid at <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and which the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> left in the hands of a Merchant, becau&s;e he was not of that humour as not to make advantage of his Money. And this it was that made Mr. <HI>de Louvois</HI> &s;peak &s;o boldly in the pre&s;ence of all the Court, that if the Confederates had gained a great Victory, they &s;hould not draw thence &s;o much Pro|fit as was pretended, becau&s;e in&s;tead of advancing into <HI>France,</HI> they would return to the Siege of <HI>Treves,</HI> and
<PB N="111" REF="58"> thence into their Quarters. In ef|fect, this was the Pretext that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> took, &s;aying, That it was no point of good Sence to en|gage them&s;elves &s;o far into a Coun|try, and leave behind them &s;o good Places; that the Scope of their Uni|on was only to deliver <HI>Germany</HI> from Slavery, which they could no way better do, than by driving the <HI>French</HI> out of a Town, which was not only con&s;iderable for its Scituation, but al&s;o for being the ordinary Abode of one of the fir&s;t Electors of the Em|pire.</P>
<P>The News that came a day or two after, that the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi</HI> was got into <HI>Treves,</HI> fini&s;hed the gi|ving a colour to his De&s;igns. He re|mon&s;trated to tho&s;e who were not of his Opinion, that the Pre&s;ence of &s;uch a Man was not to be contemned, who be&s;ides that he perfectly knew the Trade of War; was al&s;o anima|ted by the De&s;pair of what had be|fallen him. In effect, he fought as a true De&s;perado; and if a Captain of Foot, named <HI>Boisjourdan,</HI> had not
<PB N="112" REF="59"> treated &s;ecretly with the Be&s;iegers, to put the Place into their hands, upon certain Conditions whereunto many others al&s;o con&s;ented, either this Mare&s;chal would have been &s;lain up|on the Breach, or he would have &s;hewn whereof a brave Man is capa|ble, when animated by a great De|&s;pair. But as he was upon the Ram|part, exciting every one to do his Devoir, <HI>Boisjourdan</HI> had the in&s;olence to tell him, That it was in vain for him to animate them to a Defence, more ra&s;h than rea&s;onable; that eve|ry one knew what made him act, that it was the De&s;pair of having been beaten; but that, &s;ince they were no cau&s;e thereof, it was for him to draw him&s;elf out of it as he could, without enveloping them in his Mi&s;|fortune; that the Town was of it &s;elf nothing worth; that the Walls were be&s;ides beaten down by the Can|non, the Enemy lodged even in the Ditch, and in fine, every thing rea|dy to take it by A&s;&s;ault, if they had not remedied it in Time and Place; that &s;ince they well believed, that for
<PB N="113" REF="59"> the Rea&s;ons he had touched upon, he would never hear &s;peak of Compo&s;i|tion, they had taken care to do it without him, and that he had it in his Pocket; that it was his part then to conform to a thing, which, be&s;ide that it was already done, was al&s;o done with rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Never perhaps has &s;uch another Affair been heard of. It was indeed very extraordinary to &s;ee, that a &s;imple Captain of Foot had thus treated of the Surrendry of a Place, to the prejudice of a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France</HI> who was therein, and &s;o many other Officers his Superiors. The Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi</HI> al&s;o, finding him&s;elf &s;o much the more moved, as the thing appeared to him new, put his hand to his Sword at the begin|ning of his Di&s;cour&s;e, and as he was going to kill him, a Souldier who &s;tood Sentinel &s;topt him, by offering to fire upon him. This cau&s;ed the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Creqni</HI> to leave <HI>Boi&s;|jourdan,</HI> and pa&s;s his Sword through the Body of the Souldier; which done, he ran again after <HI>Boisjourdan,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="60"> who &s;eeing that he had to deal with &s;o rude a Game&s;ter, leapt through the Breach into the Ditch, thinking to &s;ave him&s;elf among the Imperia|li&s;ts; by whom being de&s;pi&s;ed, as a Man unworthy, after what he had done, to keep company with hone&s;t Per&s;ons, he would have pa&s;s'd into the furthe&s;t parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> But being di&s;covered, as I take it, at <HI>Thionville,</HI> he was conducted from thence to <HI>Mets,</HI> where by Sentence of the Council of War he had his Head &s;truck off, a very gentle Puni&s;h|ment for &s;o great a Crime as his.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Enemy, who was at the Gates, failed not to take hold of &s;o favourable an Opportunity to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Town. They entred immediately, and the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi</HI> had &s;carce time to &s;ave him&s;elf in the Church, which was good enough, and where he pretended to make yet &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. They &s;ummoned him there to &s;ign the Compo&s;ition which <HI>Boisjourdan</HI> had made; for the Confederates would keep to it, wherefore they
<PB N="115" REF="60"> had given Order that there &s;hould no Injury be done either to the Garri|&s;on, or Inhabitants. But the Mare|&s;chal, not willing that &s;o &s;hameful an Affair &s;hould be hereafter imputed to him, refu&s;ed to do it, but in the mean time agreed with <HI>Saveu&s;e,</HI> Co|lonel of Hor&s;e, who had e&s;caped with him after the Defeat, and had &s;ince followed his Fortune, that he &s;hould &s;ign the Capitulation, to the end that having his Liberty, he might go to Court, to give an account of his Actions; for he was in great di&s;|quiet, how they would receive there what had &s;ince this little while befal|len him. <HI>Saveu&s;e,</HI> who was intirely devoted to the Mare&s;chal, failed not to execute his Orders, whil&s;t he on his &s;ide endeavoured to obtain an hone&s;t Compo&s;ition; but &s;ince the Po&s;t where he was, was not tenable, he was obliged to yield upon Di&s;|cretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e happy Evenements for the Confederates, with what befell them al&s;o advantagious in <HI>Catalonia</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> had been defeated in open
<PB N="116" REF="61"> Field, after they had given a Battel without Order and Di&s;cipline, ought to have been followed with many o|ther great Succe&s;&s;es; if the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who, as I have already &s;aid, was prepo&s;&s;e&s;t with Jealou&s;y, had not al&s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;t. others therewith. Thus in&s;tead of drawing thence the Advantage which they might have probably hoped for, they had the vexation to &s;ee that all this turned to Smoke; whereas the Enemy, dex|trou&s;ly profiting by our Di&s;cords, made every day new Conque&s;ts, the Lo&s;s whereof in the mean time fell al|ways upon <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e it was on that &s;ide that they made their princi|pal Enterprizes.</P>
<P>But to fini&s;h the beating down of this Crown, the Town of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> chief of the Realm of <HI>Sicily,</HI> revol|ted again&s;t it, induced thereto by the terrible Exactions of their Viceroys, who&s;e Friends had always hindred the Complaints that People made a|gain&s;t them from coming to the Ears of the Sovereign; for in fine, it is a Cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t the
<PB N="117" REF="61"> Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;upport one a|nother; &s;o that whatever becomes thereby of the Pre&s;ervation of the State, it is all con&s;idered as nothing at what time their Intere&s;t comes in competition with it. And this it is which makes that Crown, altho it po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many rich States and Coun|tries of great Extent, to be at this day neverthele&s;s poorer than a little Prince, who &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s above the hundredth part of what it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth. In effect, without going any farther, what is <HI>Holland,</HI> in compari|&s;on of all <HI>Spain,</HI> of the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples, Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> the State of <HI>Milan,</HI> and &s;o many others, that I &s;hould never have done if I would &s;pecify them all? In the mean time, what doth not <HI>Holland</HI> at this time do? And is it not &s;he that might at this day &s;ave all <HI>Europe,</HI> if &s;he would unanimou&s;ly employ all her Forces? But to return to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> the Revolt thereof not only drew a new War on that &s;ide, through the Protection which <HI>France</HI> gave that Town, but al&s;o put a great deal of Di&s;order in
<PB N="118" REF="62"> the Affairs of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were obliged ha&s;tily to withdraw their Troops from <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and &s;end them into <HI>Italy.</HI> By this means the <HI>French</HI> finding them&s;elves Ma&s;ters in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> retook <HI>Bellegarde</HI> which they had lo&s;t, pillaged all the Coun|try from the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains e|ven beyond <HI>Gironne;</HI> and had they had a de&s;ign of making them&s;elves Ma&s;ters thereof, as well as of many other Places, there is a great appear|ance that nothing could have hindred them: But not being willing to e&s;ta|bli&s;h them&s;elves beyond the&s;e high Mountains, which Nature &s;eems to have put for a Separation between the two Realms, they contented them&s;elves with the Prey they had got, and let the People feather them|&s;elves every Winter, to the end they might plume them every Spring.</P>
<P>Altho the War of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> was of very great con&s;equence, yet &s;hould I not cro&s;s the Seas to &s;eek a Subject for this Work, were it not that I &s;hall at the &s;ame time find a fair mat|ter to prove the Unfaithfulne&s;s of the

He behaved him&s;elf in this Charge, during the &s;pace of eighteen Months, or thereabouts, with great &s;atisfaction to the People, to whom he cau&s;ed at his Arrival to be delivered <HI>gratis</HI> a quantity of Corn, which had been brought from <HI>France,</HI> and whereof the <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;es</HI> could ne|ver have more need; for they had already a long time eaten Hor&s;es, Rats, Mice, and other unclean Ani|mals, their be&s;t Repa&s;ts being only of the&s;e &s;orts of things, with a few ill-ta&s;ted Herbs when they could get them. But at the end of that time, <HI>Vallavoir</HI> having had a Difference with the Intendant, becau&s;e they would both rob without &s;haring one with another, was revoked, and the Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> &s;ent in his place, who brought into that Country a greater Name, but a le&s;s Sufficiency. He came thither with the quality of
<PB N="120" REF="63"> a Viceroy, which &s;o much the more plea&s;ed the People, as they believed that this would oblige <HI>France</HI> to do &s;omething more than &s;he had hither|to done, to di&s;engage &s;o con&s;iderable a Town, which was &s;till &s;o clo&s;ely block'd up, that it received no other Succour to live upon, but what came to it from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Duke was in the Town, he put all his Authority into the hands of his Secretary, took care to make provi&s;ion of all &s;orts of good Wines, enquired where were the faire&s;t Courtizans, cau&s;ed a Chair to be made, wherein he might &s;leep com|modiou&s;ly as he was carried along; and in fine, forgot nothing whereby he might keep him&s;elf as portly as when he came thither. At the be|ginning, when he pa&s;s'd along the Streets, every one extolled his Civi|lity, becau&s;e they ob&s;erved him from time to time to bow down and lift up his Head, like a Man that would &s;alute &s;ome-body; but at la&s;t, a Per&s;on having ob&s;erved that it was becau&s;e he &s;lept, and having &s;hewn it
<PB N="121" REF="63"> to others, there was no more &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing to &s;ee him pa&s;s along the way, which was very commodious for him, becau&s;e he was not very de|&s;irous that it &s;hould be always known whither he went.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Refre&s;hments which <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> from time to time re|ceived from <HI>France,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay to what mi&s;ery it was reduced. There needed no more but to give Bread, to have the riche&s;t Goods in the Town. Husbands there pro&s;tituted their Wives, Fathers their Daughters, Bro|thers their Si&s;ters; and there was not &s;o much as the Superiors of Nunne|ries, but endeavoured to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Intrigue of &s;ome hand&s;om religious Woman. But the Hatred which the Inhabitants had conceived of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> was &s;o &s;trongly imprinted in their Mind, that all langui&s;hing and dying as they were, they cho&s;e rather their Mi&s;eries, than to return under their Dominion. They let them|&s;elves then be amu&s;ed by the frivo|lous hope, which the Viceroy from time to time gave them, that he would
<PB N="122" REF="64"> &s;oon go open the Pa&s;&s;ages; but they were other Pa&s;&s;ages that he thought on, which had in the mean time &s;o ill treated him, that they had brought him to his Litter.</P>
<P>The Officers, according to the Example of their Chief, led not a more glorious Life. The Chevalier Duke, General of the Hor&s;e, made good provi&s;ion of the&s;e &s;orts of Pa&s;|&s;ages; and tho he were above five and fifty years old, yet mu&s;t he have no le&s;s than four, &s;o much fear had he of wanting. For the Commander of the Foot, as he brought with him out of <HI>France</HI> not a Pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t all &s;orts of Evil, but an Evil wor&s;e than all the Evils of <HI>Italy,</HI> he took of them where-ever he could find them, well knowing that wor&s;e could not befall him.</P>
<P>The Sea-Officers followed the Example of the Land-ones; and if they vi&s;ited their Ve&s;&s;els, it was only to bring aboard them lewd Women. It was in the mean time impo&s;&s;ible, that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould not have know|ledg of the&s;e &s;orts of Di&s;orders;
<PB N="123" REF="64"> but the Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> held her by &s;uch &s;weet Bonds, that having com|mitted the Fault to &s;end him to <HI>Me&s;|&s;ina</HI> for a Viceroy, &s;he had rather <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> &s;hould peri&s;h, than revoke this <HI>Sardanapalus.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the War, which every day grew hotter and hotter in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> had been &s;o favourable to <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Parliament being now a&s;&s;embled, they humbly addre&s;&s;ed to their King, who had at the end of the &s;econd Campaign made Peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> That he would be plea&s;ed to recall the Engli&s;h Troops, which were in the &s;ervice of the French King; whereunto they al&s;o added, That he would declare War again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> unle&s;s they abandoned the Protection of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> which was an Ob&s;tacle to the Peace that had been &s;o long talkt of. The King of <HI>England,</HI> tho a Friend to <HI>France,</HI> yet conde&s;cending to the Reque&s;ts of his People, &s;ent to the French King to do both the one and the other, if he would have him &s;till continue his Friend.

But it was here that her In&s;incerity appeared in its full ex|tent, whereof perhaps the King of <HI>England</HI> may yet one day te&s;tify his Re&s;entment, when his People, when the Fanatical Party among&s;t them had of late Years almo&s;t frighted in|to a Rebellion, with Dreams and Vi&s;ions of Popery and Arbitrary Go|vernment, &s;hall, which they begin a|pace to do, have regained their for|mer Loyalty and Zeal for his Service.

<P>Being, as I have ju&s;t now told you, nece&s;&s;itated either to abandon it, or to fall out with <HI>England,</HI> &s;he had cho|&s;en the fir&s;t; &s;he was in the mean time at a very great &s;tand, how to bring it about without the knowledg of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ine&s;es,</HI> who, had they

<P>Certainly altho I here blame <HI>France</HI> for her Di&s;&s;imulation, I &s;hall not for|bear prai&s;ing this new General, who acted with &s;o much Order and Di&s;|cretion at his Arrival, that no-body entred into di&s;tru&s;t of that which brought him thither, and I can even &s;ay that there was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion of it, till &s;uch time as he was quite ready to &s;et Sail. Before he arrived at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> he went a&s;hore at
<PB N="127" REF="66"> <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> where <HI>La Villedieu,</HI> who had been Captain of the Guards, was Governor; whom not having found at home, becau&s;e he was, like the re&s;t, making love to a Nun, he took one of his Hor&s;es, rode round the Ramparts, ordered new Fortificati|ons, and in fine, gave his Orders like a Man that knew how to do &s;omething el&s;e than eat, drink, and &s;leep; af|terwards, without &s;taying a moment, he again went aboard his Ve&s;&s;el, and having continued his cour&s;e, came in|to the Road of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> whither the Jurats came in a Barque to receive him in Peace. The Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> came al&s;o to meet him upon the Har|bor, where he gave him the right|hand, as having no longer any Au|thority in the Country. In effect, after he had dined with him, he went aboard a Ve&s;&s;el, &s;et Sail for <HI>Provence,</HI> and endeavoured afterward to gain <HI>Lions,</HI> to get him&s;elf cured of a Ma|lady, which began much to incom|mode him.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> after he had di&s;cour&s;ed with the Jurats, went
<PB N="128" REF="67"> upon the Harbor, whither he had &s;ent for the Captains of the Gallies, whom he ask'd, whether they were ready to put to Sea? And when they an&s;wered that they were not, he demanded what hindred them, and again&s;t what time they could be ready? And they telling him, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to be ready in le&s;s than a Months time, the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> who knew what kind of life they led, made them &s;o &s;evere a Reprimand, that they well &s;aw they had another manner of Man to deal with than Mr. <HI>de Vivonne.</HI> He told them, they might do as they thought good, but if they were not ready in eight days, he would put the Oars to his Ve&s;&s;els, and leave them to make love as long as they would. In the mean time, to cover this Ha&s;te with &s;ome con&s;iderable De&s;ign, he cau&s;ed a Map to be drawn of all the neighbouring Towns which apper|tained to the Enemies, as <HI>Sarago&s;a, Melazzo, Palermo,</HI> and <HI>Sema,</HI> &s;pread|ing a report that he would &s;oon march to reduce them.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="67">
<P>In the mean time, he &s;ware upon the Holy Go&s;pels in the Name of the King his Ma&s;ter, to protect the Coun|try again&s;t all Per&s;ons whatever, and to keep their Privileges; an Oath which neverthele&s;s he &s;oon after brake, as I will &s;hew you in its place. The Ceremony of taking it was ve|ry fine, it was performed in the great Church, which they had hung with the riche&s;t Hangings in the Town, and whither the People came in &s;o great a Croud, that they did not on that day think on their Mi&s;ery: The Streets al&s;o through which the Vice|roy was to pa&s;s, were hung, and Scaffolds erected every where to &s;ee him go: For tho he &s;eemed to be come to deprive the Women of their Plea&s;ures, yet &s;ince it was nothing but their Mi&s;ery which made them do as they did, they look'd upon him however as the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> that was come to deliver every one from the Tyranny of Satan, I mean the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> He ob&s;erved, moreover, as he pa&s;s'd along, that one of the Citizens, the more to &s;hew his Zeal
<PB N="130" REF="68"> for the Service of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> had placed on the &s;ide of his Chamber-window a Canopy, under which was the Portrait of the King; and as he came back, he cau&s;ed his Coach, wherein were the Jurats, to &s;top before that Hou&s;e, and told them, That &s;ince they came from making him &s;wear before GOD to protect them and all the People, and to keep their Privileges; he de&s;ired, that they al&s;o &s;hould &s;wear before the Portraiture of the King his Ma&s;ter, which was there pre&s;ent, that they would keep all Fidelity to him, would never &s;peak of returning under the Dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and would cau&s;e to be &s;everely puni&s;hed, the fir&s;t that &s;hould be &s;o bold as to mention any &s;uch thing. At the &s;ame time the&s;e poor People, to whom an Interpreter had explicated what he &s;aid, (for he &s;pake no otherwi&s;e to the Jurats, nor the Jurats to him) fell upon their Knees, and putting forth their hands out of the door of the Coach, &s;ware before the Portraiture of the King all he would have them &s;wear.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="68">
<P>This profound Di&s;&s;imulation pro|duced all the Effect he expected from it; they were confirmed daily more and more by his Conduct, that he would be the Deliverer of the State. Thus as he per&s;i&s;ted always in the Re&s;olution, as he &s;aid, of be&s;ieging <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> or <HI>Melazzo,</HI> for he &s;pake no more of <HI>Palermo,</HI> they not only &s;uf|fered him to embarque Store of Vic|tuals without &s;u&s;picion, but the Ju|rats al&s;o offered to encrea&s;e his Troops with &s;ome Companies of Ci|tizens, if he thought he had not Forces &s;ufficient for &s;o great a De&s;ign. When the Provi&s;ions were inmbarqued, he cau&s;ed the Foot to go aboard the Ve&s;&s;els, and there being now nothing to do but to withdraw the Ho&s;pital, he &s;pake to the Jurats to find him out a Man, with whom he might bargain for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the &s;aid Ho&s;pi|tal, and he would lay him down Mo|ney before-hand; but his De&s;ign, he &s;aid, was to leave as few People there as he could, becau&s;e he believed the ill Air did them more hurt than their Malady it &s;elf; and when he &s;hould
<PB N="132" REF="69"> once be before <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> or <HI>Melazzo,</HI> he would &s;end them a League or two thence to take the Air, which would contribute more to their Health, than all the Remedies in the World. By this means he &s;o well cajoled them, that they them&s;elves &s;ought him out the Man he de&s;ired, to whom he gave two Months Advance for fifty poor Wretches, who had their Soul upon their Lips, and who were &s;o far from being able to brook the Sea, that it was judged they could not &s;o much as get to the Ve&s;&s;el without certain Death. As for the others, they were imbarqued in a Ve&s;&s;el by them&s;elves. So that this being done, the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade</HI> had nothing more to fear; for his Hor&s;e were at <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> all ready to imbarque, ex|pecting only Ve&s;&s;els for that purpo&s;e. In the mean time, there being four|teen Pieces of Cannon in Battery up|on the Mouth of the Haven, he made his Ve&s;&s;els go out thence into the Road, whither he him&s;elf al&s;o went, after he was got aboard the Admiral. Thence he &s;ent for the Jurats, to
<PB N="133" REF="69"> whom he had given the mo&s;t &s;pecious Orders in the World, of what they &s;hould do in his ab&s;ence; and the&s;e over-credulous Jurats, imagining that he had forgot to tell them &s;omething, ha&s;ted diligently aboard him, but were very much &s;urprized to hear him &s;peak in the&s;e terms: <HI>That it was now no longer time to di&s;gui&s;e any thing unto them, that the Expedition he was going to make, was to return into</HI> France, <HI>where the King his Ma&s;ter had need of his Troops and his Ve&s;&s;els; that as long as he could a&s;&s;i&s;t them, he had done it with a great deal of Joy and Clemency, &s;ince it had co&s;t him above four and forty Millions; that now he could no longer do it, it was for them to find in their Con&s;tancy the Con&s;olation which perhaps he could not give them.</HI></P>
<P>A Complement &s;o dry, and &s;o little expected, ca&s;t the&s;e poor Peo|ple into a De&s;pair, more ea&s;y to be conceived than de&s;cribed. They en|deavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from his De&s;ign by the mo&s;t moving Words imaginable, and by Actions al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;s, ca&s;ting them&s;elves ma|ny
<PB N="134" REF="70"> times at his Knees; but &s;eeing that all this operated nothing, they be|&s;ought him, that he would at lea&s;t delay his departure for eight days, to the end that during that time, tho&s;e who could no longer hope for Mercy from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had &s;o mortally offended, might re|tire into <HI>France</HI> with their Families. A Prayer &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o rea&s;onable, ought not, methinks, to have been refu&s;ed. But the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> who gloried in being pitile&s;s, told them, That this could not be, and that all he had to &s;ay to them was, That if tho&s;e who would come, were not ready by the Morrow-Morning, he would weigh Anchor, and no lon|ger expect any one. They gained however by the force of their Pray|ers one Day more; after which they went to declare this &s;orrowful News to the Inhabitants, who were in &s;o terrible a de&s;pair thereat, that I do not believe the like was ever &s;een. All the Men, all the Women, all the Children came upon the Haven, pier|cing the Air with their Complaints,
<PB N="135" REF="70"> and tearing the Hair from their Heads; there was heard only a dread|ful Groaning, whereunto &s;ucceeded a mournful Silence, as it were, to give the <HI>French</HI> time to make reflection on their Mi&s;eries: but &s;eeing, in fine, that they were not moved therewith, they began again the &s;ame Lamen|tations, with Po&s;tures &s;o worthy of Pity, that I &s;hall never, as long as I live, think thereon, without being touched with compa&s;&s;ion. In fine, &s;eeing that this operated no more than before, every one re&s;olved to em|barque and there were four hundred of the be&s;t and riche&s;t Families in the Town, which pa&s;s'd into <HI>France,</HI> but with little &s;atisfaction: For the <HI>French</HI> having &s;oon after imputed to them a Con&s;piracy in <HI>Provence,</HI> whe|ther it were true, or only a pretence to get rid of them, made them go out of the Country, and they are gone to linger out their Mi&s;eries in another Climate, where perhaps more compa&s;&s;ion will be taken of their Misfortunes.</P>
<PB N="136" REF="71">
<P>As for tho&s;e that remained at <HI>Me&s;|&s;ina,</HI> their Puni&s;hment was very &s;pee|dy: For the <HI>French</HI> had not yet weighed Anchor, when there aro&s;e in the Town a <HI>Spani&s;h Faction,</HI> which had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted therein, and which had &s;everal times endeavoured to reduce it under the obedience of its true Ma&s;ter. To this there op|po&s;ed it &s;elf another, which would not hear &s;peak of ever falling again under the Yoke of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and they were going to decide their Difference by compleating the De&s;o|lation of this Town, the Image whereof was already but too fright|ful, if the Governor of <HI>Regio,</HI> who was not above two Leagues off, had not &s;tept in to hinder the Di&s;order. Whil&s;t he was negotiating on the one and other &s;ide, to make them lay down their Arms, with A&s;&s;urance of Pardon to both of them; the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> having by the help of their Faction made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Town, entred thereinto with Drums beating, breathing forth no-but a ju&s;t Vengeance, but which they
<PB N="137" REF="71"> rendred too cruel by their manner of taking it; for without demurring any farther, as many People as put their Heads out of the Windows to &s;ee them pa&s;s, &s;o many did they kill, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who appeared to be any thing, aiming particularly at Per&s;ons of Quality.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to tell how many Ma&s;&s;acres they made in this poor de&s;olate Town, nor how much they thereby augmented the Aver&s;ion the People already had for them: for, be&s;ides that I &s;hould perhaps have difficulty enough to do it, things were carried to &s;uch extremities, it belongs not to my Subject, whereun|to I &s;hould do much better to return, without digre&s;&s;ing any farther.</P>
<P>The abandoning of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> joined to the Inclination which the King of <HI>England</HI> always had for <HI>France,</HI> brought again upon the Board the Propo&s;itions of Peace, which had al|ready been talk'd of before, but that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would never hearken to them, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> King &s;pake not of re&s;toring <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> When I
<PB N="138" REF="72"> &s;peak here of Propo&s;itions of Peace, it is ea&s;ily under&s;tood that I will &s;peak of what pa&s;s'd in the Cabinet of Princes, and not of what pa&s;s'd at <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where they had already wa&s;ted &s;o long time to no purpo&s;e. The&s;e Propo&s;itions did not equally plea&s;e every Body: For altho the Emperor and Princes of the Empire, had done nothing yet &s;o ad|vantagious, but that a good Peace was to be preferr'd before &s;o unpro|fitable a War, &s;ince neverthele&s;s they con&s;idered, that in the condition wherein things were, they could not hope for &s;uch an one as they de&s;ired, and as was to be wi&s;h'd for the Good of <HI>Europe,</HI> they were rather of opi|nion to continue the War, than to do any thing whereof they might for the future repent. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> added thereunto, That &s;ince it was not ea&s;y to rea&s;&s;emble, when once they &s;hould be &s;eparated, they ought to take good care not to do it, without knowing how and upon what terms. But the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who in the Party of the Confederates had
<PB N="139" REF="72"> the Power which the Je&s;uits attribute to the Pope, that is, of binding and loo&s;ing, &s;aid on the contrary, That for their part they were weary of the War: and as they had not the Keys of the Apo&s;tle, but the Keys of the Che&s;t, my meaning is, that they pro|vided for the Appointment, they &s;aid in two words, That they mu&s;t treat, otherwi&s;e that they had not where|withal to furni&s;h out &s;o great Ex|pences.</P>
<P>This was a determinate Sentence to the greate&s;t part of the Confederates, every one thought then only of ma|king his Treaty the mo&s;t advantagi|ous he could. But as this was all that <HI>France</HI> de&s;ired, to wit, to di&s;|unite them, &s;he took care only to content the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in whom con|&s;i&s;ted all the Strength of the Party. To this two things might much con|tribute: the one, to re&s;tore unto them the Town of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> which they had in vain endeavoured to reco|ver by Arms; the other, to give them &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that the Peace &s;hould be durable, and not &s;ubject to be
<PB N="140" REF="73"> broken on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. As to the former, <HI>France</HI> did not at all he|&s;itate; &s;he promi&s;ed at fir&s;t the Re&s;ti|tution of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> which gave the <HI>Hollanders</HI> more de&s;ire than ever to terminate the War, for they &s;aw their Frontiers thereby a&s;&s;ured, as well as their State in its fir&s;t Splen|dor. For the other, &s;he procured the King of <HI>England</HI> to intervene, who promi&s;ed to be Guarant of the Peace. And to give a great Idea of its Duration, there were Propo&s;iti|ons made in re&s;pect of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom &s;he offered to re&s;tore certain Places, which were to &s;erve for a Barrier, as well to her as to the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> who by this means &s;aw that <HI>France</HI> removed yet farther from their Neighbourhood, which was all they had to de&s;ire, not loving &s;o dangerous a Neighbour. The <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> before they accepted of the&s;e Conditions, did all they could, be|ing deceived by Appearances, to make them be accepted al&s;o by their Allies; but &s;eeing that they were ob|&s;tinate not to do any thing therein,
<PB N="141" REF="73"> they made their Peace apart, imagi|ning well, as the truth was, that this would &s;oon oblige them to &s;peak o|therwi&s;e. In the mean time, they &s;ent to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was gone towards <HI>Mons,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had a long time block'd up, and which was very much &s;traitned, to draw back his Troops. But whe-this Prince received not their Pacquets time enough, or whether he were in de&s;pair to &s;ee that they had let them|&s;elves be deceived by the Artifices of the <HI>French,</HI> he gave them Battel, believing perhaps to make the States change their De&s;ign, by doing &s;ome Action of great Eclat. This Fight was ob&s;tinate enough; but after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had forced the <HI>French,</HI> and gained a notable Ad|vantage over them, he cau&s;ed the Peace to be publi&s;hed, rather not to appear di&s;obedient to the Orders of the Republick, than for any rea&s;on he had to hope for any good from it.</P>
<P>This Peace was followed by that of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Emperor, and the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> but the Mar|que&s;s
<PB N="142" REF="74"> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> finding that, according as his Accommodation had been propo&s;ed, it was wholly di&s;ad|vantagious to him, refu&s;ed to &s;ign it: and this Refu&s;al having obliged <HI>France</HI> to carry her Arms as far as <HI>Mindem,</HI> where there was &s;ome Skir|mi&s;h to hinder the Pa&s;&s;age of the Ri|ver, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> was fain to bend, but with little &s;a|tisfaction to <HI>Suedeland,</HI> on who&s;e be|half the <HI>French</HI> had neverthele&s;s un|dertaken this War: For tho all the Princes re&s;tored her a great part of what they had gotten from her, yet &s;ince they &s;till kept &s;omething, &s;he i|magined that all that <HI>France</HI> did for her, was nothing in compari&s;on of what &s;he ought to do, con&s;idering the Perils whereunto &s;he had expo&s;ed her &s;elf, and even the Lo&s;&s;es &s;he had &s;uffered for her &s;ake: In effect, for having been willing at her &s;u&s;citation to make a Diver&s;ion in <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;he had lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of her Ve&s;|&s;els, the E&s;teem of her Neighbours, her Riches, her Reputation, and in one word, was reduced to &s;o bad a
<PB N="143" REF="74"> Condition, that if the War had con|tinued any longer, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what would become of her Fortune.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Di&s;content of <HI>Suedeland,</HI> was &s;oon followed by two others, whereof one touched her Intere&s;t, and the other her Honour. The fir&s;t was the Homage, which <HI>France</HI> de|manded of her for the Dutchy of <HI>Deuxponts,</HI> by virtue of a Decree of the Royal Chamber of <HI>Mets,</HI> at this day &s;o known and renowned in all <HI>Europe.</HI> The &s;econd was, the Re|fu&s;al &s;he made to pay her the Sub&s;idies &s;he owed her of old; if &s;he did not fir&s;t con&s;ent to renew the Treaty which was between the two Crowns, and was very near expiring.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;aw that the <HI>French</HI> King was already preparing to make new Alliances, they began on their &s;ide to think of &s;ecuring them&s;elves from his Enterpri&s;es. For this purpo&s;e they propo&s;ed a League with the neighbouring Princes, where|of the King having knowledg, was &s;o offended thereat, that tho he would
<PB N="144" REF="75"> him&s;elf have &s;ubjected the <HI>Suede</HI> to what I ju&s;t now told you, he failed not to command the Count <HI>d' Avann,</HI> his Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to tell the States, That if they pro&s;ecuted any further the Treaty they had be|gun, he &s;hould take it for an Act of Ho&s;tility, and &s;hould &s;ee what he had to do. The&s;e Menaces were odious to all hone&s;t Per&s;ons, but they were &s;o far from being frighted by them in <HI>Holland,</HI> that on the contra|ry they made ha&s;te to conclude the Treaty, and to defend their Liberty by Arms, which they re&s;olved al&s;o no more to lay down but upon good Terms, if the King obliged them to take them up again, whereof they were neverthele&s;s in expectation eve|ry day, till the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> was rai&s;ed, which will perhaps make him think twice upon what he hath to do.</P>
<P>However it be, the Haughtine&s;s wherewith he acted towards Sove|reign Powers, giving cau&s;e to fear every thing from his Ambition, <HI>Suedeland</HI> made al&s;o a League with
<PB N="145" REF="75"> <HI>Holland,</HI> by which they promi&s;ed one another reciprocal A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;eeing that <HI>Suedeland</HI> had declared again&s;t him, was interi|orly vexed thereat; but without letting it be &s;een, he &s;ollicits the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> the ancient Enemies of the <HI>Suede,</HI> to enter into League with him, wherein he found not much dif|ficulty; for the&s;e two Princes were &s;o ill contented with the la&s;t Peace they were obliged to make, that they would not hear &s;peak of allying them|&s;elves any more with Princes, who had &s;o &s;hamefully, as we may &s;ay, abandoned them. This was the rea|&s;on that the Mini&s;ters of the Empe|ror, who pretended not only to op|po&s;e this Alliance, but al&s;o to make one with the&s;e two Princes, were &s;o little hearkned unto. Add here|unto, that their Intere&s;ts &s;ufficiently accorded with their Re&s;entment; for as to <HI>Denmark,</HI> he never entred into any League wherein the <HI>Suede</HI> was; and there is as great an Antipathy between tho&s;e two Crowns, as
<PB N="146" REF="76"> there can be between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> he has for a long time al&s;o had a Pique at the <HI>Suede,</HI> ever &s;ince the great <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> got from him. <HI>Pomerania,</HI> which he had neverthele&s;s reconquered with &s;o much Glory during the&s;e la&s;t Wars, but was not happy enough to keep it, and that, as I have &s;aid, for having been abandoned by his Allies.</P>
<P>This Seed of War was &s;oon fol|lowed by Ho&s;tilities, much more ap|parent on the &s;ide of <HI>France.</HI> All on a &s;udden, and when they lea&s;t thought of it, &s;he &s;eized on the Town of <HI>Strasburg;</HI> and when the Emperor thought to make his Complaints thereof by the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> whom he &s;ent expre&s;ly to St. <HI>Germain en Laye,</HI> &s;he an&s;wered the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> That &s;he wondred the Emperor &s;hould meddle with that which nothing concerned her; that <HI>Strasburg</HI> was one of the Dependen|cies of <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and con&s;equently be|longed to her by virtue of the Treaty
<PB N="147" REF="76"> of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> If the Emperor had been well coun&s;elled, not only then, but a long time before, this Misfor|tune would not perhaps have befallen all <HI>Germany:</HI> for he had already &s;uf|fered but too much from <HI>France,</HI> who by virtue of a certain Right of De|pendence, which &s;he had &s;et up to invade the E&s;tates of every one, rui|ned both Princes and Gentlemen; the&s;e of their Goods, by putting Gar|ri&s;ons upon them; tho&s;e of their Ho|nour, by depriving them of all Right of Sovereignty. But it was in vain for them to complain to him thereof; he had rather believe his Mini&s;ters, or, to &s;ay better, his Je&s;uits, than his Dignity, which would not permit him to &s;uffer &s;uch an Affront without re&s;enting it. He had remitted all this to the Diet; and the Diet, in|&s;tead of &s;peedily determining things, as the Nature of the Affair required, &s;pun them out in length, as if they had them&s;elves been of accord with the Enemies of the Empire.</P>
<P>A Proceeding &s;o feeble on all &s;ides, gave <HI>France</HI> in the mean time oppor|tunity
<PB N="148" REF="77"> to make new Enterpri&s;es; and not content with having entren|ched on the Liberty of <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;he encroached al&s;o on that of <HI>Italy,</HI> which began to tremble, &s;eeing her Troops in <HI>Ca&s;al.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had hitherto been Spectators of all that pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Germany,</HI> began then to make a great Stir, &s;o much the more, as that <HI>France</HI> had be&s;ieged the Town of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> under pre|text al&s;o of that Right of Depen|dence, whereof I ju&s;t now &s;pake. They moved Heaven and Earth to &s;tir up the Potentates to cau&s;e Ju&s;tice to be done them; but every one was as deaf, as if they had been hired by <HI>France</HI> to con&s;pire with her in all &s;he did. In fine, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> as well that which is in <HI>Spain,</HI> as that which is in <HI>Germany,</HI> rouzed up it &s;elf, and &s;eeing that the <HI>French</HI> had not yet fortified <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> nor <HI>Strasburg,</HI> they re&s;olved to make &s;ome Attempt upon the&s;e two Places, before new Works and a &s;tronger Garri&s;on ren|dred the thing more difficult. <HI>France,</HI> &s;eeing that the Troops of the Em|peror
<PB N="149" REF="77"> drew near to <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and that tho&s;e of <HI>Milan</HI> took the way of <HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> drew back at the &s;ame time hers from before <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> and made them march towards the Fron|tiers. This Motion hindred the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> from attempting any thing: but <HI>France</HI> would not ac|knowledg why &s;he had rai&s;ed the Siege; on the contrary, &s;he publi&s;hed that it was only through Genero&s;ity, the <HI>Turks</HI> being ready to make a de|&s;cent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> whereinto never|thele&s;s they entred not till above a year after.</P>
<P>The Blocking up of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> had furni&s;hed abundance of People farther matter of Di&s;cour&s;e. Hone&s;t Per&s;ons among&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> as well as other Nations, could not them|&s;elves &s;ufficiently admire, that in the mid&s;t of a profound Peace, there &s;hould thus be &s;o many Ho&s;tilities committed. But that which gave &s;ome occa&s;ion, as we may &s;ay, to weep, made others laugh, &s;eeing they had not the courage to oppo&s;e it. In the mean time, <HI>France</HI> had no
<PB N="150" REF="78"> &s;ooner what &s;he demanded, but &s;he would have &s;omething more. And like herein to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who af|ter they have a long time fa&s;ted, are not contented with a little nouri&s;h|ment; &s;o was not &s;he contented to have thus one Place or two at a time, but &s;he wanted a whole World to &s;a|tisfy her Ambition. But &s;ince &s;he had proved in the la&s;t War, that &s;he &s;hould hardly bring it about by force, &s;he re&s;olved to make u&s;e of Addre&s;s, a Means much le&s;s dangerous, and often more efficacious. Now to pre|tend that this &s;hould be by dividing the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> be&s;ides that it was a thing which would require long time, and was moreover &s;ubject to change, becau&s;e tho they might be deceived, yet not &s;o far as to &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to be utterly ruined, there was nothing &s;ure therein, every one being in di&s;tru&s;t. To &s;horten therefore the matter, &s;he re&s;olved to bring the <HI>Turk</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> hoping that the Empire, &s;eeing it &s;elf mena|ced by &s;o redoubted an Enemy, would never fail to call him to its A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="151" REF="78"> not having Forces of its own to re|&s;i&s;t &s;uch a Power. <HI>Guilleragues,</HI> her Amba&s;&s;ador, who had &s;o many Di&s;|putes with the Grand-Vi&s;ier touching the Affair of <HI>Scio,</HI> having received her Orders, believed it was a means for him to gain a good E&s;teem with the Port, which, like <HI>France,</HI> de&s;i|red only to invade the E&s;tates of others.</P>
<P>In effect, the Grand-Vi&s;ier, who &s;ince his advancement to that Office, had done nothing to make him&s;elf talk'd of, and who was very glad to bring him&s;elf into E&s;teem, received the Propo&s;ition &s;o much the more a|greeably, as he imagined the thing to be ea&s;y, after the manner that <HI>Guille|ragues</HI> propo&s;ed it unto him: For this Amba&s;&s;ador promi&s;ed, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould be entred into <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> the King his Ma&s;ter &s;hould make Diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the Grand-Vi&s;ier knowing the Forces of <HI>France,</HI> no way doubted but that the Empire, being thus attack'd on two &s;ides by two &s;uch con&s;iderable Powers, would in a &s;hort time be
<PB N="152" REF="79"> brought to yield. <HI>Teckely,</HI> chief of the Malecontents of <HI>Hungary,</HI> with whom <HI>France</HI> held corre&s;pondence from the beginning of his Revolt, a&s;|&s;ured the Grand-Vi&s;ier of the &s;ame thing; for &s;he cau&s;ed the &s;ame Di&s;|cour&s;es to be made to him, as to the Grand-Vi&s;ier: but &s;he deceived them both; and &s;ince, whatever Ambition &s;he had, &s;he endeavoured not to lo&s;e her Reputation among&s;t the neigh|bouring Princes, &s;he &s;ought only to bring the Empire &s;o low, that it could never ri&s;e again but by her means.</P>
<P>The Grand-Vi&s;ier being &s;o well a|nimated to this Enterprize, cau&s;ed &s;uch terrible Preparations to be made in all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, that not only the Emperor was alarmed there|at, but al&s;o all <HI>Italy,</HI> which extreme|ly apprehended le&s;t this great Storm &s;hould pour down upon her. The Pope excited all the Chri&s;tian Princes to give help again&s;t this common E|nemy of Chri&s;tendom: but knowing enough the State of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to believe that there was
<PB N="153" REF="79"> no|thing to be expected from that &s;ide, he &s;ent a Brief to the King, by which he exhorted him, that in ca&s;e his In|tere&s;ts permitted him not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor him&s;elf, he would at lea&s;t not hinder other Princes from a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing him. And for to give Example to others, he &s;ollicited the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> to contribute with him to the making up a good Sum of Money, which he &s;ent to the Emperor as &s;oon as ever he could no longer doubt that it was again&s;t him that &s;uch extraor|dinary Preparations were made.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>France,</HI> to make a &s;hew of dealing &s;incerely with the Grand-Vi&s;ier, cau&s;ed her Troops to advance to the Frontiers, which did not much le&s;s a&s;toni&s;h the Empire, than all the Preparations made a|gain&s;t it by the <HI>Turk.</HI> The Diet, whereof I &s;pake before, thought it expedient, &s;eeing the Arms of two &s;uch great Princes &s;o ready to trouble the Repo&s;e of all <HI>Germany,</HI> to make the King explain his De&s;ign, and cau&s;ed his Amba&s;&s;ador to write unto him for that purpo&s;e: But the King,
<PB N="154" REF="80"> who cared not to declare his thoughts, an&s;wered, That he was not to give account of his Actions to any one; but that he would however tell them, that it was for them to give him &s;peedy &s;atisfaction upon all his Preten&s;ions, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould take &s;uch cour&s;e as him&s;elf thought be&s;t. In effect, not content with ha|ving de&s;poiled &s;o many Princes of their Liberty, with having invaded <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and the ten Free-Towns, contrary to the Faith of Treaties, with retaining the E&s;tates of the Princes of <HI>Petite Pierre</HI> and <HI>Waldens,</HI> without any appearance of Ju&s;tice; and &s;o many other things, which would be too long to particularize; he would al&s;o have the Diet to de|clare, that whatever he had done was according to the Rules of Equity, and the Emperor him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;ub|&s;cribe this Declaration. Thus would he e&s;tabli&s;h by the Right of Nations, what he had u&s;urped only by Right of Convenience, and would have a Treaty to cover his Faith-breaking and Inju&s;tice. For my part, I &s;hall
<PB N="155" REF="80"> not blame tho&s;e of the Diet, who coun&s;elled the Emperor to yield to the Time, to accommodate him&s;elf with <HI>France,</HI> which in the condition wherein things then were, was capa|ble to do him a great deal of Mi&s;chief, and in fine, not to lo&s;e the Empire by un&s;ea&s;onable Stiffne&s;s; becau&s;e I will believe that what they did was out of a good de&s;ign. But the Em|peror, all be&s;et as he was with the E|mi&s;&s;aries of <HI>France,</HI> was not yet &s;o deprived of his Under&s;tanding, but that he ea&s;ily di&s;cerned whither &s;uch a Step as this tended, which by di&s;|crediting him in the Empire, would have as much rai&s;ed the Credit of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who de&s;ired only to enter thereinto like a Fox, but would afterwards have kept him&s;elf there like a Lion. In effect, he no &s;ooner &s;aw the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> but belie|ving them now too far advanced to go back again, he retired from his Troops, at the Head whereof he had put him&s;elf under pretence of a Re|view, to create the greater Jealou&s;y.</P>
<PB N="156" REF="81">
<P>In the mean time, he cau&s;ed the Electors, a good part of which were his Friends, to be told under|hand, that they ought to call him to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Empire, which was in danger of falling down under the Power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> if it were not &s;upported by Forces capable to re&s;i&s;t him. But on the other &s;ide, he ex|cited the Grand-Vi&s;ier to go &s;treight to <HI>Vienna,</HI> without &s;taying either at <HI>Raab</HI> or <HI>Camorra,</HI> adding, That the&s;e Places would fall of them&s;elves, as &s;oon as ever he &s;hould make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the other, which would draw al&s;o with it the Ruine of the whole Empire, and the Con&s;ternation of all the Electors. Altho the Grand-Vi&s;ier di&s;tru&s;ted the Sincerity of <HI>France,</HI> of who&s;e De&s;igns he every day learnt &s;omething; yet he belie|ved however that this Coun&s;el could not be ami&s;s: and re&s;olving to follow it, after he had terribly wa&s;ted the Country, he &s;ent Detachments from under his Conduct, to block up the&s;e two Places &s;o clo&s;e, that their Gar|ri&s;ons might not incommode the
<PB N="157" REF="81"> Convoys which came to his Army.</P>
<P>He marched afterwards on the &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> having already pa&s;s'd the <HI>Raab,</HI> by Intelligence with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> to whom the Defence thereof had been committed, and came to plant his Camp before <HI>Vien|na,</HI> to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of Chri&s;tendom, and e&s;pecially of the Emperor, who was obliged to retire to <HI>Lintz,</HI> whither the Je&s;uits would follow him, as faithful Companions of his Fortune. In the mean time, they not having been able to find Conveniences to depart all the &s;ame day, &s;ome of them were by the Peo|ple immolated to their ju&s;t Re&s;ent|ment, as they pretended to follow their Fellows. They &s;ent them to keep company with the three <HI>Hunga|rian</HI> Barons, whom they had &s;ome time &s;ince cau&s;ed to be put to death through Covetou&s;ne&s;s of their E&s;tates, upon which the inferior People laid the Cau&s;e of the War, altho it had indeed another Original, as I think I have demon&s;trated. In effect, be|&s;ides all that I have already &s;aid, to
<PB N="158" REF="82"> &s;hew the Intelligence which the King of <HI>France</HI> held with the <HI>Turk,</HI> there happened a thing which no longer left any room to doubt it: For the Letters of one of her Mini&s;ters Se|cretary were &s;urprized, by which all the Intrigue was di&s;covered; &s;o that the Emperor having cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted, was re&s;olved to puni&s;h him &s;everely: but under&s;tand|ing that <HI>France</HI> had on her &s;ide ar|re&s;ted the Secretary of the Amba&s;&s;a|dor the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> whom &s;he threatned to treat in the &s;ame manner as the Emperor &s;hould do the other, he dur&s;t not pu&s;h things any farther, but was contented with threatning him &s;everely, &s;o to di&s;|cover how far this Intelligence ex|tended.</P>
<P>Moreover; Whether <HI>France</HI> ex|pected to take great Re&s;olutions up|on what &s;hould pa&s;s at the Siege, or whether &s;he were only willing to be the fir&s;t that &s;hould know in what manner it would turn, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Seppeville,</HI> her Envoy at the Empe|ror's Court, had Order to di&s;patch
<PB N="159" REF="82"> Couriers unto her upon the lea&s;t Cir|cum&s;tances, which neverthele&s;s &s;uffi|ciently te&s;tified, that it was &s;omething more than Curio&s;ity which made her act. There came to her three in one Week, and Foreign Mini&s;ters learnt nothing but by her means. But &s;he continually mi&s;repre&s;ented things: for at fir&s;t there ran a Report at <HI>Paris,</HI> that <HI>Vienna</HI> was already lo&s;t, which &s;he was above all very de&s;irous to in&s;inuate into the Mini&s;ters of other Princes, whom, without ma|king &s;hew of any thing, &s;he cau&s;ed in the mean time to be &s;ounded, to know whereon their Ma&s;ters would determine, in ca&s;e this News &s;hould be found true.</P>
<P>I could here, if I would, relate a|bundance of memorable Actions that pa&s;t at this Siege, whereof I have as good Memoirs as any other; but &s;ince in matter of War I never con|cern my &s;elf to &s;peak, but of tho&s;e things where I have been pre&s;ent, I &s;hall forbear to do it, contenting my &s;elf to relate here tho&s;e which con|cern my Subject, to wit, tho&s;e where|in
<PB N="160" REF="83"> reigns the In&s;incerity of <HI>France,</HI> to the end that every one may take heed thereof. I am, moreover, going to &s;urprize abundance of People, by &s;aying, that her De&s;ign was not at fir&s;t that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould &s;eize on <HI>Vienna;</HI> but let every one believe what he will, this &s;hall not hinder me from continuing to &s;peak the Truth, making above all things profe&s;&s;ion to do it, without &s;uffering my &s;elf to be diverted from it by ought whatever. Now to prove my A&s;&s;ertion, there needs only to know the Offers &s;he had made, and &s;till every day did make to the Emperor, to &s;end fifty thou|&s;and Men to rai&s;e the Siege; the Ef|forts &s;he made with the Electors, to incline the Emperor to accept this Succour; the &s;ecret Reflections &s;he prayed them to make on the State wherein the Empire was, and on the Nece&s;&s;ity it had to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, not only powerfully, but al&s;o &s;peedily; that the Forces of <HI>Poland</HI> were nei|ther yet a&s;&s;embled, nor a&s;&s;embling; that be&s;ides, they were not &s;uch Troop as they imagined, that it was
<PB N="161" REF="83"> rather an Arrierban than an Army; that the Great Men of the Country were not all &s;o contented, as they were &s;aid to be, with the Alliance which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had made with the Emperor; and in fine, that they would bring &s;o many Ob&s;tacles to the Succour which the Emperor thought to draw from thence, that they might indeed always talk of it, but &s;hould never &s;ee it come: That, on the contrary, that of <HI>France</HI> be|ing quite ready, would march at the fir&s;t Command; that the <HI>French</HI> were as good as the <HI>Polanders</HI> at Handy-Strokes, which this occa&s;ion requi|red; that they had be&s;ides more Obedience and Experience, two things &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the having an happy Succe&s;s in their Enterprizes.</P>
<P>Certainly all the&s;e Rea&s;ons were &s;pecious to him that &s;hould not have been prepo&s;&s;e&s;t of her Unfaithfulne&s;s. But &s;ince all the Re&s;i&s;tance which was made at <HI>Vienna,</HI> was to no other end, but not to &s;ee the Empire fall into the hands of another, it was believed
<PB N="162" REF="84"> that all the&s;e Offers were rather to be rejected than accepted. In the mean time, they prayed the <HI>French</HI> King, &s;ince he had &s;uch good De&s;igns, that he would remove his Troops from the Frontiers, the Jealou&s;y whereof hindred abundance of the Princes of the Empire from &s;ending theirs to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But he an|&s;wered, That if they let the Empire be lo&s;t through their default, he would &s;ave it tho again&s;t their Wills; that he would keep him&s;elf always armed, and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them at the fir&s;t Reque&s;t they &s;hould make him; that he gave them his Word he would attempt nothing again&s;t the Empire, and that his Word ought to &s;uffice them. But what reliance could there be upon a Word which had been &s;o often violated, as I think I have &s;hewn? Upon a Word, of the Frailty whereof there were &s;o many Examples, and which, to excu&s;e it &s;elf, &s;till &s;ought Pretences to ca&s;t up|on others the Faults whereof it was it &s;elf only guilty? Upon a Word, in fine, which acknowledged no other
<PB N="163" REF="84"> Law but Force and Violence, which would have every thing pa&s;s accord|ing to its own Will; which would have all bend under it, Sovereign Princes, and tho&s;e that were not &s;o; but which never wanted Pretences to palliate whatever it did, were one but never &s;o little in the humor to let ones &s;elf be &s;educed by its delu|&s;ory Per&s;ua&s;ions?</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations, which had obliged the Emperor to refu&s;e &s;o great a Succour, obliged al&s;o the o|ther Princes to believe, that it was neither the Empires Intere&s;t nor their own to pre&s;s the Emperor to accept it. Thus every one being in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the Grand-Vi&s;ier made a terrible Ra|vage in all <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> where he found not any Re&s;i&s;tance: and tho the <HI>French</HI> King was not entred into <HI>Ger|many,</HI> as he had promi&s;ed, he cea&s;ed not to make a great Diver&s;ion, as I ju&s;t now &s;aid, no-body daring to &s;end away their Troops, for fear tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould invade what they &s;hould find for their convenience.
<PB N="164" REF="85"> Many Per&s;ons were thus led away in|to Captivity by the Infidels, who be|fore their be&s;ieging <HI>Vienna</HI> had de|tached the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to come and make their Cour&s;es as far as the Gates of that Town. The&s;e Barbarians &s;et fire where-ever they pa&s;&s;ed, pillaged the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Laxembourg,</HI> and after they had carried away all the Goods that were therein, cut down al&s;o the Trees of the Avenues, through de|&s;pite (as it were) for not having found therein all the Riches they ex|pected: from thence they retired to their Body, leaving in all the Places of their Pa&s;&s;age, Marks of their Bar|barity and Cruelty.</P>
<P>The&s;e Beginnings of the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> were happy enough to the In|fidels; for all Places being yet fill'd with their Cruelties, and they having be&s;ides gained &s;ome Advantages over the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> General of the Emperor's Army, the Garri&s;on, the greate&s;t part whereof was compo&s;ed of that Army, &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive of coming to Blows
<PB N="165" REF="85"> with them. This exceedingly trou|bled the Governour, the Count <HI>de Starenberg,</HI> who had re&s;olved to keep the Town for the Emperor, or at lea&s;t to lo&s;e his Life upon the Breach; but he having found the means to rid them of all Fear, yet more through his own Example, than through any thing he could &s;ay to them, things &s;oon changed their Face, and as much as the Imperiali&s;ts were before appre|hen&s;ive of the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;o much did the <HI>Turks</HI> then begin to be apprehen&s;ive of the Imperiali&s;ts, who had daily &s;ome Advantage in every Sally. The Grand-Vi&s;ier was not however re|butted, but thought it &s;trange that <HI>France,</HI> having promi&s;ed him to make a pui&s;&s;ant Diver&s;ion, &s;hould content her &s;elf only to look on, without keeping her Word. He complained thereof to <HI>Tekely,</HI> with whom he held Communication by Letters; and <HI>Tekely</HI> to <HI>Bohan,</HI> who was <HI>France</HI>'s Corre&s;pondent with him. <HI>Bohan</HI> failed not on his &s;ide to make his Complaint to Mr. <HI>de Seppeville,</HI> to whom he &s;entword, That the Grand-Vi&s;ier,
<PB N="166" REF="86"> uncertain of the Sieges Suc|ce&s;s, might perhaps come to an A|greement with the Imperiali&s;ts; that it was for him to fore&s;ee the Prejudice which &s;uch a Treaty might bring to the Crown, and to apply the Reme|dy he &s;hould judg convenient; but for his own part, he thought there was no other choice, but either to keep their Word, or by not keeping it, to re&s;olve upon a Quarrel with the Grand-Vi&s;ier.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> having knowledg of the&s;e things by a Courier which the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Seppeville</HI> di&s;patched to her, and which arrived at <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> on Sunday the 29th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> found her &s;elf very much embara&s;&s;ed, how to make her Politicks agree with &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a Demand. It was not ma|ny days &s;ince &s;he had given her Word not to attack the Empire; and con|&s;idering, that if &s;he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon break it without any cau&s;e, or even &s;o much as pretence, &s;he &s;hould not only draw upon her &s;elf the Reproa|ches of all <HI>Europe,</HI> but &s;hould al&s;o
<PB N="167" REF="86"> for ever lo&s;e the Confidence of the Electors, whom &s;he managed with a great deal of care, &s;he took a Re&s;o|lution which &s;eemed to her capable to &s;atisfy both the one and the other Party; that is to &s;ay, Not to attack the Empire directly, for fear of lo|&s;ing her Reputation with the Electors; but to carry her Arms into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> which ought in &s;ome &s;ort to &s;atisfy the Grand-Vi&s;ier, becau&s;e this War had &s;o great a Concatenation with all the neighbouring Powers, that it would &s;oon put a good part of <HI>Europe</HI> in combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it befell her, as it ordinarily doth tho&s;e who will plea&s;e two Per&s;ons at a time, that is, that &s;he neither plea&s;ed the Grand-Vi&s;ier, nor the Electors. For the&s;e, whom the King had endeavoured to per&s;uade, as he had done al&s;o all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> that his ri&s;ing up from before <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> whereof I ere-while &s;pake, was becau&s;e of the De&s;cent of the <HI>Turks</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> thought it &s;trange that this Rea&s;on, which was
<PB N="168" REF="87"> then &s;o remote from Danger, &s;hould no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t now when the Dan|ger was &s;o near. The Grand-Vi&s;ier, on the other &s;ide, did not like, that all the&s;e great Promi&s;es terminated in making Spoil among&s;t People, Allies indeed of the Empire, but yet &s;o re|mote from it, whereas he de&s;ired that all the&s;e Ho&s;tilities &s;hould have been committed in the Center there|of. But <HI>France,</HI> who cared little for the Ends of either of them, provi|ded &s;he might attain her own, let them &s;ay what they plea&s;ed, flat|tering her &s;elf, that in re&s;pect of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;he had &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the Engagement &s;he had with them, by attacking <HI>Flanders,</HI> which makes part of <HI>Low-Germany;</HI> and for what con|cerns the Electors, they had no rea|&s;on to complain, becau&s;e &s;he had kept her &s;elf within her Promi&s;e, which was only not to attack the Em|peror, or Princes of the Empire. She believed moreover, that this Procee|ding of hers terrifying <HI>Spain,</HI> and her Allies, in regard of the pre&s;ent Conjuncture, they would all con&s;pire,
<PB N="169" REF="87"> as diligently as they po&s;&s;ibly could, to cau&s;e the Town of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> to be given her, for fear &s;he &s;hould make greater Conque&s;ts, whereof they were apprehen&s;ive in the Con|ditions wherein things were, and the Arms of the mo&s;t part of the neigh|bouring Princes being employed, as they were, either in combating the <HI>Turk,</HI> or only ob&s;erving him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom it greatly concerned not to &s;uffer this Crown to make thus eve|ry day new Attempts upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Lo&s;s whereof drew along that of their Provinces, a&s;&s;embled among&s;t them&s;elves, to &s;ee what Remedy they might bring thereunto. To which they were moreover every day exci|ted by Mr. <HI>de Fuen-Maior,</HI> Envoy of <HI>Spain,</HI> who &s;pake &s;o plainly of the King his Ma&s;ter's Inability to defend that Country, that he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;t unto them, that it could no longer be pre&s;erved without their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Many of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> concluded at fir&s;t upon War, and
<PB N="170" REF="88"> they were without doubt the mo&s;t il|luminated; but others, Lovers of Repo&s;e, and be&s;ides more attached to Commerce, having made u&s;e of the Pretence of the pre&s;ent Conjun|ctures, for to render them apprehen|&s;ive of breaking Peace with &s;o power|ful a Crown, &s;aid, that their Opini|on was to bring Matters to an Ac|commodation. This Diver&s;ity of Opinions delayed their Re&s;olution for ten or twelve days, during which they every day endeavoured to open the Eyes of tho&s;e that were blinded, hoping be&s;ides that <HI>Vienna</HI> would be relieved, which would perhaps have drawn their Minds to do that which was convenient for the Glory and In|tere&s;t of the State. But this News not coming, and they receiving on the contrary from day to day advice, that the Grand-Vi&s;ier was ob&s;tinate to continue the Siege, cau&s;ed his Camp to be wonderfully fortified, and in fine, prepared him&s;elf to fight the Relief, if any came, the States no longer expected that time to re|&s;olve; but the well-intention'd ha|ving
<PB N="171" REF="88"> made the others at la&s;t to take Re&s;olutions worthy of their Courage, they determined to &s;uccour poor af|flicted <HI>Flanders,</HI> by &s;ending her eight thou&s;and Men to put in her Places, and making a far greater Number to march, if Nece&s;&s;ity required it.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution being taken, they &s;ent Order to the Officers to leave their Garri&s;ons, and march towards the Frontiers; and the Troops which were to pa&s;s into <HI>Flanders,</HI> pa&s;s'd thither, and the others entred into tho&s;e Places of <HI>Brabant</HI> which belong|ed to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as being more expo&s;ed to the Enterprizes of <HI>France,</HI> which they knew not yet whether to treat as a Friend or an Enemy; for &s;he cau&s;ed every day the States to be told by her Amba&s;&s;ador, that her de|&s;ign was not to break with any one, but to cau&s;e Ju&s;tice to be done her concerning the County of <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> which &s;he pretended to be of the De|pendencies of what had been granted her by the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> In the mean time, they &s;till expected
<PB N="172" REF="89"> with impatience the Succe&s;s of the Succour which was preparing for <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> her &s;elf al&s;o ex|pected the &s;ame, for to take openly her Re&s;olutions upon what &s;hould arrive there; but at la&s;t, after a long expectation, they learnt that this Succe&s;s was as glorious as the Chri&s;ti|ans could de&s;ire, the Grand-Vi&s;ier's Infantry being totally routed, their Cavalry very much endammaged, all their Cannon and Baggage lo&s;t; in fine, the Place &s;uccoured; with a thou&s;and other remarkable Circum|&s;tances, which it would be too long to particularize.</P>
<P>This great News, which was con|firmed by a Courier, whom the Prince <HI>de Waldeck</HI> di&s;patcht expre&s;ly to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> put at fir&s;t all the Officers of War, who de&s;ired only matter to employ their Valour, into unimaginable Tran&s;ports of Joy. Every one figured to him&s;elf all <HI>Eu|rope</HI> reunited again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> they repre&s;ented to them&s;elves with plea|&s;ure &s;o many Outrages revenged, &s;o
<PB N="173" REF="89"> many Attempts happily executed, &s;o many unfortunate Princes ree&s;tabli&s;ht in their E&s;tates; and in fine, every one in particular built him&s;elf a For|tune according to the Grandeur of his Courage; when all of a &s;udden, they fell from a great Hope to a ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion, that this great Succe&s;s would bring rather Peace than War. Tho&s;e who were of this Sentiment, alledged for their Rea&s;ons, That Peace not being yet made with the <HI>Turk,</HI> none would refu&s;e to treat, if <HI>France</HI> departed from her Preten&s;ions, which it was to be pre&s;umed &s;he would do in the Fear &s;he ought to have, le&s;t, this Peace being made, all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould fall upon her: that one Mark of her having been always willing to re&s;erve to her &s;elf this Back-door, is, that &s;he had not yet attempted any thing, altho it were near a Month &s;ince &s;he entred into <HI>Flanders:</HI> that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who were as it were the Soul of all the Party, would not have War, unle&s;s they were obliged thereunto by indi&s;|pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity; and that they
<PB N="174" REF="90"> &s;hould no &s;ooner &s;ee an Opportunity of being able to continue in repo&s;e, but they would embrace it with plea|&s;ure: that the others could do no|thing without them: and that, in one word, the common Intere&s;t of Chri|&s;tendom &s;et a&s;ide, it had been more advantagious for them that <HI>Vienna</HI> had been taken than relieved.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons were indeed &s;trong; but there were oppo&s;ed unto them o|thers, which were no le&s;s &s;trong: For hereunto it was an&s;wered, That altho Peace were not yet made with the <HI>Turk,</HI> there was neverthele&s;s all rea&s;on to believe that it would in|ce&s;&s;antly be made, it having been the Policy of the <HI>Turks</HI> to treat as &s;oon as ever they were once beaten: That if the <HI>French</HI> had not yet attempted any thing, it was not &s;o much to ex|pect what would arrive from <HI>Vienna,</HI> as to leave &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion of their Moderation, pretending thereby, that <HI>Vienna</HI> being taken, the Empire, whereof they aimed to make them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters, would call them in to
<PB N="175" REF="90"> its A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which would facilitate the means of their accompli&s;hing their De&s;igns: That now they were fallen from all the&s;e Preten&s;ions, there was nothing more left them but to a&s;&s;ert their Claim by Arms, which they were too glorious not to do: That the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of who&s;e Courage they &s;eemed willing to enter into di&s;tru&s;t, had rea&s;on to complain, that after having alone, as they had done, em|braced the Defence of <HI>Flanders,</HI> they &s;hould be thought to be &s;uch &s;lender Politicians, as not to lay hold of an Occa&s;ion which was &s;o favourable to them, to make a Crown, who&s;e Neighbourhood they ought &s;o much to apprehend, to give up what he had &s;wallowed: That, in fine, they were too wi&s;e, and too illuminated, not to &s;ee, that altho <HI>France</HI> &s;hould even incline to &s;ome Peace, it would be only a daubed-up Peace, &s;uch as have been tho&s;e &s;he has made the&s;e fifteen or twenty Years.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine which of the&s;e two &s;eemed to have the
<PB N="176" REF="91"> greater Rea&s;on, but methinks it is not very difficult to conclude in be|half of the latter: For altho there be nothing to be added to their Rea|&s;ons, I &s;hall &s;ay however, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who would ea&s;ily have yielded to any Conditions of Peace in ca&s;e <HI>Vienna</HI> had been taken, will now grow &s;tiff, &s;ince they hope to be &s;up|ported by <HI>Germany,</HI> which on her &s;ide will be very glad, after &s;he &s;hall have made Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> to free her &s;elf from the <HI>French</HI> Domi|nation. However it be, the Victory which the Chri&s;tians have gained, cannot but have good Effects; for whether we have Peace or War, we ought to hope for an happy I&s;&s;ue, and that one way or other we &s;hall find means to mortify a Crown, which begins a little too much to mi&s;-under|&s;tand it &s;elf.</P>
