<P>VPon the Lord Governour <HI>Cromwels</HI> neere ap|proach with his Army, to the frontier and im|pregnable Garri&s;on of <HI>Tredah,</HI> his Lord&s;hip hath &s;ent a Summons to the Governour Colonell <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> for the &s;urrender thereof to the power and obedience of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> but the Governour retur|ned a very re&s;olute and peremptory An&s;wer, intima|ting, <HI>That he abhord with his &s;oul the brand of perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;se, that he was re&s;olved to di&s;play the banner of loy|alty, and to stand is in the defence and pre&s;ervation of the trust repo&s;ed in him to the last man, &amp;c.</HI> Whereupon, the Lord Governour immediatly called a Councel of Officers, for the well-ordering of the Army, to the end the work might appear more facile and ea&s;ie, and in|deed &s;o excellent were the debates and con&s;ultations thereof, that their De&s;ign was lookt upon with great admiration.</P>
<P>And upon Saturday morning being the 8. of this in|&s;tant <HI>Septemb.</HI> twelve thou&s;and Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dra|goons, marched up in <HI>battell-array,</HI> with Trumpets &s;ounding, and Drums beating again&s;t the Town, where they &s;oon encamped them&s;elves, cutting off divers pa&s;|&s;es, &amp; u&s;ing the rare&s;t &s;tratagems of war, for &s;treight|ning the enemies quarters.</P>
<P>About 7 at night, the Army advanced &s;omewhat neerer, and divers &s;trong Guards both of Hor&s;e and Foot were placed within twice musket &s;hot of the walls, where the Foot intrenched them&s;elves. And a|bout 5 in the morning, the be&s;ieged di&s;covered us, who drawing neerer to each other, &s;aid, <HI>they would give us a dinner to welcome us into</HI> Ireland; and indeed they were very circum&s;pect in keeping of their word, for between
<PB N="5" REF="4">11 and 12 they gave us a vi&s;it, &s;allying forth with a con&s;iderable party of Hor&s;e, and lining the ob&s;cure places with many hundreds of foot, but failed in their promi&s;e; for upon their fir&s;t charg again&s;t one of our hor&s;e-guards, they were &s;o gallantly received, that they &s;oon quitted the place, our hor&s;e pur&s;ued them with|in musket &s;hot of their works, receiving a great volley from their Ambu&s;cado, in which we lo&s;t 4 men, and 7 hor&s;e; of the enemy kild and taken 13. The next morning being <HI>Munday</HI> they attempted another &s;ally, but not daring to put it in execution, retreated in a|gain without action, remaining all day very &s;ilent, till the Curtain of the mo&s;t high Canopy began to expell and darken the &s;plendor of <HI>Sols</HI> beauty, who even at the clo&s;e of the day upon the relieving our guards, gave us a volley both with great and round &s;hot, which grazed and did no execution.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> being the 12. in&s;tant, Lieu. col. <HI>A&s;hton</HI> (a great Papi&s;t, and Nephew to the Governour) about two of the clock in the morning made a very de&s;pe|rate &s;alley upon two of our foot-guards, with 500. Iri&s;h, which by rea&s;on of the &s;udden &s;urprizall of our Perdews, and Centinels, cau&s;ed great difficulties to in|tervene, yet notwith&s;tanding, the Wings of providence &s;eeming as a great Bulwark to pre&s;erve and defend us, our men received their furious on&s;et, but being over|powred, the Vau-guard retreated to the next, and bo|dying, advanced to the other ingaged, fell upon the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> killed 40, took 20 pri&s;oners, and forced the re&s;t to a di&s;honorable retreat, with the lo&s;s of ten; be&s;ides tho&s;e in the former engagements, pri&s;oners exchanged were equall, about 50. above 100 killed and wounded, wher|of on our part 30.</P>
