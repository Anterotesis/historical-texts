<P>I Am resolved to make no A|pology for This <HI>short Account of the Magnificent, and Noble City of London,</HI> where you will meet <HI>with nothing offensive,</HI> and I think I have observed every thing that is Remarkable in it; It would have been unpardon|able in me, to have omitted a|ny matters which the Curious might be desirous to know, having an Inimitable Pattern from one of that Country lately, who for the clearness of his Ex|pression, the Elegancy of his
<PB REF="5">
Descriptions, as well Ingenuous Choice of his Subjects, deserves a Particular <HI>Salutation</HI> from all the Admirers of the <HI>Belles Let|tres</HI> in the Universe.</P>
<P>I might here take an Oppor|tunity to beg Pardon of the Eng|lish, for my misrepresentations Thirty Years ago, but 'tis to be hoped this Book will make my Peace with that Nation. The following pages will show you the Considerable heads I de|sign'd to Treat off, and now I have paid my Devoirs at the En|trance, <HI>I will not Importune you a|ny longer.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY TO <HI>LONDON.</HI> In the Year, 1698.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">After the Ingenuous Method of that made by <HI>Dr. Martin Lyster</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> in the same Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THis Tract was written chiefly to</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 1.</NOTE> <HI>satisfy my own Curiosity,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Curiosity</NOTE> being <HI>in a place where I had lit|tle to do,</HI> I though fit to write a Book for such People as had idle time enough upon their hands to read it. The Eng|lish <HI>Nation value themselves upon</HI> a plain Honesty, join'd with Hospitality; these make them Courteous to <HI>Stran|gers,</HI> but they are not very easy with their <HI>Curiosity.</HI> For they do <HI>not build</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 5.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
<HI>and dress mostly for Figure, as the</HI> French, <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 4.</NOTE> <HI>who are certainly the most Polite Nation in the World, and can praise and Court with a better grace than the rest of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I did not intend to put on the Specta|cles</HI> of the Present State of <HI>England,</HI> Written by Dr. <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> nor any <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 2.</NOTE> Survey of the same for trusting to my Eyes, <HI>I had a mind to see without 'em.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But to content you Reader, I promise not to trouble you with Ceremonies,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 2.</NOTE> <HI>either of State, or Church, or Politicks;</HI> for though I met with an English Gentleman who proffer'd to shew me <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Sharp <HI>and Sir</HI> Charles Cotterel <HI>compar'd.</HI></NOTE> the Princes of the Blood, the Prime Ministers of State, the Lord Mayor, and other Officers belonging to a <HI>City of so immense a greatness as that of London,</HI> yet I refus'd the Civility, and told him, <HI>that I took more pleasure</HI> to see honest <HI>John Sharp</HI> of <HI>Hackney,</HI> in his <HI>White Frock,</HI> crying <HI>Turneps ho!</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 3.</NOTE> <HI>four bunches a penny,</HI> than Sir <HI>Charles Cottrel, making room for an Embassa|dour, and I found my self better dispos'd, and more apt to learn the physiognomy of a hundred Weeds, than of five or six Princes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
<HI>I arriv'd at</HI> London, <HI>after a tedious</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Journey, in bad weather; for I fell sick upon the road, and lay dangerously ill</HI> of the Tooth-ach.</P>
<P><HI>I believe I did not see the tithe of what</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 5.</NOTE> <HI>deserves to be seen; because for many things I wanted a relish, particularly for Painting and Building,</HI> though I con|fess the grandure of a City chiefly consists in Buildings; and I verily be|lieve <HI>London</HI> to be one of <HI>the most Beau|tiful and Magnificent in</HI> Europe.</P>
<P>It is also most certain, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Menages.</NOTE> common people of <HI>London,</HI> live dis|pers'd in single Houses, <HI>whereas in</HI> Pa|ris, <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 5.</NOTE> <HI>there are from Four to Five, and to Ten menages or distinct Families in many Houses,</HI> from whence I infer that as to the Commonalty <HI>Paris</HI> may be <HI>more populous than London,</HI> although perhaps their dwelling mayn't be so wholsome and cleanly.</P>
<P>I found <HI>the Houses some of hew'n stone</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brick <HI>and</HI> Stone Houses.</NOTE> <HI>entire, some of Brick with free Stone;</HI> as the <HI>Crown Tavern</HI> upon <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> and the corner House of <HI>Birchin-Lane,</HI> and several others. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 8. Port|cochezs <HI>and</HI> Re|mises.</NOTE></P>
<P>Divers of the Citizens Houses, <HI>have Port-cochezs to drive in a Coach,</HI> or a
<PB N="4" REF="8">
Cart either, <HI>and Consequently have Courts within, and mostly Remises to set them up,</HI> such persons as have no Port|chochez, and consequently no Courts or Remises, set up their Coaches at o|ther places, and let their Horses stand at Livery.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Cellar <HI>Windows of most Houses</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 8. Cellar Windows.</NOTE> <HI>are grated with strong barrs of Iron,</HI> to keep thieves out, and <HI>Newgate</HI> is grat|ed up to the Top to keep them in. <HI>Which must be of vast expence!</HI></P>
<P><HI>As the Houses are magnificent without,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9. Bureaus.</NOTE> so they furnish them within accord|ingly. But I could not find, that they had any <HI>Bureaus of Ivory.</HI></P>
<P>Upon viewing the Braziers and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9. Things wanting in England for want of Com|merce with France.</NOTE> Turners Shops, <HI>I found it true, what my Country Man Monsieur</HI> Justell <HI>for|merly told me, that according to his Cata|logue there were near threescore utensils, and conveniencies of Life more in</HI> En|gland <HI>than in</HI> France. But then the English, since the breach of their com|merce with <HI>France,</HI> lie under great necessities of several commodities fit|ing for the ease and support of Hu|mane Life, as <HI>Counterfeit Pearl Neck|laces,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 142.</NOTE> Fans, Tooth Picks, and Tooth
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Pick Cases, and especially Prunes, the Calamity of which has been so great for Ten Years last past, that they have not had enough to lay round their Plum-porridge at <HI>Christmas.</HI></P>
<P>I must to give a faithful account de|scend <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10, Kennells.</NOTE> even to the Kennels; <HI>the Gutters are</HI> deep, <HI>and lain with</HI> rough edges, <HI>which make the Coaches not to glide easily over 'em,</HI> but occasion an imployment for an industrious sort of people call'd Kennel-Rakers.</P>
<P><HI>The Squares</HI> in <HI>London are</HI> many <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10. Squares. James'<HI>s</HI> Bloom|bury. <HI>P.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and <HI>very beautiful,</HI> as St. <HI>James, Sohoe, Bloombury, Red-Lyon. Devonshire, none of the largest,</HI> and Hogsdon not <HI>yet finish'd. But that which makes the dwel|ling in this City very diverting, is the facility of going out into the fields,</HI> as to <HI>Knightsbridge,</HI> where is an excellent Spring-Garden, to <HI>Marribone,</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 11. Knights|bridge <HI>and</HI> Islington.</NOTE> is a very good Bowling-Green, <HI>Isling|ton</HI> as famous for Cakes, as <HI>Stepeny</HI> is for Bunns.</P>
<P><HI>But to descend to a more particular re|view</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 11.</NOTE> <HI>of this great City, I think it not a|miss to speak first of the Streets.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Coaches</HI> in the streets <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coaches</NOTE> <HI>which are very numerous, but the Fiacers
<PB N="6" REF="9">
are not hung with double</HI> springs, at the four Corners, <HI>which springs would in|sensibly Break all Jolts.</HI> So that I fou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">d the case alter'd in <HI>England;</HI> and I to had rather ride in a Fiacre at <HI>Paris,</HI> than in the easiest Chariot of a Lord Embassador; to my great asto|nishment at <HI>London,</HI> found that in a Hackney Coach, there was <HI>not a jolt but what affected a Man,</HI> from whence I drew these Surprising Conclusions.</P>
<P>First that a Hackney <HI>is a miserable, Voiture,</HI> and next, <HI>that a Man may be</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 13.</NOTE> <HI>more tired in an hour in that, than in six hours riding in</HI> my Lord Ambassa|dors <HI>casiest Chariot.</HI></P>
<P>I saw a Boy that had Harness'd two Doggs, which drew a small Voiture <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 13. Boy in a little Coach.</NOTE> with a Burden in it, and I saw a little Master in a little <HI>Vinegrett&eacute;, drawn</HI> a|long by <HI>two Boys;</HI> much bigger then himself, and <HI>push'd behind by a Maid.</HI> These <HI>I was willing to omit as thinking them at first sight scandalous, and a ve|ry jest, they being wretched businesses in so magnificent a City.</HI></P>
<P>Finding <HI>that neither Post chaises nor Rouillions were in use in London,</HI> I told <NOTE PLACE="marg">Post chaises Rouillions not in En|gland.</NOTE> them of 'em, <HI>how both Horses pull, but
<PB N="7" REF="9">
one only is in the Thilles, how the Coach|man mounts the Rouillion, but for the Chaise he only mounts the side House, and that they might be introduced to good purpose.</HI> But I found the English <HI>Cu|riosity</HI> so small that I did not see any Rouillion made during my six months stay in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for their Recreations and Walks,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 14. Receati|ons <HI>and</HI> Walks.</NOTE> St. <HI>James Park is frequented by people of Quality,</HI> who if they have a mind to <HI>have better and freer Air, drive to Hide Park,</HI> where is a Ring for the Coaches to drive round, and hard by is Mrs. <HI>Price</HI>'s, where are incomparable Sil|labubs, <HI>out of other parts of the Town,</HI> they go to <HI>Hamstead</HI> and <HI>Cane Wood,</HI> (an admirable place for Nuts, as Mother Huffs for Bottle Ale) <HI>scarce any side a|miss.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 14.</NOTE> I had almost forgot that in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park are many Seats, for the Entertainment of all People, the Lackqueys and Mob excepted, but of this more here|after.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis pretty to observe how the Magi|strates</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 16. Signs in the streets.</NOTE> indulge the Inhabitants of this <HI>Great City,</HI> by <HI>this small instanced,</HI> for whereas <HI>in Paris the King has caused the Citizens to take down their signs,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="10">
not <HI>to exceed a small measure of Square.</HI> In <HI>London</HI> they may be of what mea|sure they please, even to a Monstrous bigness, as my great Curiosity ob|serv'd, in the Sign of the <HI>Ship Tavern,</HI> and the <HI>Castle Tavern</HI> in Fleet-street, which has almost <HI>Obscur'd</HI> the <HI>Sun;</HI> and Barbers hang out poles of a great huge length almost as long as a Missen Mast.</P>
<P><HI>There are a great may Publick Inns</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 16. Inns The White Horse in Fleet|street, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>London, where Lodging are to be Let,</HI> as the <HI>Bull Inn</HI> in <HI>Bishopgate-street,</HI> the <HI>Saracens Head</HI> in <HI>Friday-street,</HI> the <HI>White Horse</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> and others. But besides these there are divers other places so called; as <HI>Cliffords Inn, Clements Inn, Lyons Inn,</HI> &amp;c. where several <HI>Gentlemen</HI> Practioners of the Law Reside. <HI>This seems as it were to denote that</HI> heretofore Attorneys might lodge in <HI>Publick Inns</HI> as well as other <HI>Strangers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the River of</HI> Thames, both a|bove <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 17. Boats.</NOTE> Bridge and below, are <HI>a vast number of Boats of Wood, Hay, Char|cool, Corn, Wine, and other Commodi|ties.</HI> When a Frost comes there are not so many. <HI>But when a Thaw comes, they</HI> are often in <HI>danger of being Split
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and Crush'd to piecss.</HI> And upon my Word, <HI>there have been great losses to the Owners of such Boats and goods,</HI> upon such occasions. The reason why there are more Boats below Bridge than above, is because there is a Cu|stom House, which brings into the King of <HI>England,</HI> a Revenue able to defend the sovereignty of the Seas, a|gainst any Enemy whatsoever; and the Reason why there lie so many Hundred Large Vessels of all sorts and of all Nation; is because they cannot get through Bridge Heigh! and there are a great many light boats loaden with Brooms, Gingerbread, Tobacco, and a Dram of the Bottle Ho! Above Bridge is a vast Boat, with a House upon it, and a Garden in the Garret, and further up the River at <HI>Chelsey,</HI> is a Land Ship very large built on pur|pose never to go to Sea.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Beggars</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 20. Beggar.</NOTE> people whose necessities force them to ask relief from such as they think able to afford it.</P>
<P>But there are no <HI>Monks</HI> who de|clare <NOTE PLACE="marg">No Monks</NOTE> against Marriage. And a Cer|tain Learned Person told me that he
<PB N="10" REF="11">
did not like <HI>starved Monks,</HI> but that he was for <HI>free marriage, and that the Flesh|eaters will ever defend themselves if not beat the Lenten men.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore he was <HI>entirly</HI> for Propa|gation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 21.</NOTE> <HI>that men might be like the Stars in the Firmament, or the shells and sand upon the Sea shore;</HI> and so notwithstanding any Circumstances of Life Age or For|tune, should marry, and that it was as prudent in an old Man of threescore and ten, as in a Youth of one and twenty.</P>
<P><HI>There is</HI> a great deal of <HI>Noise in this City, of publick Cries of things to be sold,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Cries. <HI>P.</HI> 22.</NOTE> and great <HI>disturbance from Pamphlets and Hawkers.</HI> The <HI>Gazetts come out twice a week,</HI> and a great many <HI>buy 'em.</HI> When a thing is lost, they do not as in <HI>Paris,</HI> put a <HI>Printed Paper on the Wall,</HI> but if it be of small value, the Bell-man Cries it, and if it be a thing of greater moment as for Example, a <HI>Lapdog,</HI> &amp;c. then they put it in the Advertise|ments.</P>
<P><HI>The streets are lighted all the Winter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets Lighted. <HI>P.</HI> 23.</NOTE> but <HI>there is an impertinent usage of the people at</HI> London, <HI>not to light 'em, when the Moon shines.</HI> They ridiculously
<PB N="11" REF="11">
defend themselves by saying, they can see by moonshine, and have no more reason to hold a Candle to the Moon than to the Sun. <HI>There were three Young Gentlemen of good Families in a</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Frolick,</HI> went a scouring, <HI>broke the Lights,</HI> and were sent to the Counter, <HI>and could not be releas'd thence without di|ligent Application of Friends, and paying</HI> Garnish to their fellow Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>The Avenues to the City, and all the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets clean.</NOTE> <HI>Streets are Paved with Pebbles, and Flints and Rag Stones, and there is great care to keep them clean. In winter for Exam|ple, upon melting of the Ice,</HI> you shall see all the Prentices and Porters up in Arms, with Brooms and Paring Sho|vels; <HI>so that in a</HI> few <HI>hours</HI> time <HI>all parts of the Town are to admiration clean, and neat again to walk on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I could heartily wish,</HI> I had been at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dust. <HI>P.</HI> 25.</NOTE> <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Summer,</HI> to have seen whe|ther they have <HI>more Dust</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> than in <HI>Paris.</HI> I have notwithstand|ing in my <HI>Curious</HI> Enquiries after <HI>Dust,</HI> found that there are several dust Carts about the Town, and there are seve|ral Women that take delight, and as I have heard pay money to ride in em.
<PB N="12" REF="12">
A fine Lady about the Town, was taken thence, and upon her change of clean Linning took upon herself the Title of <HI>Clinderaxa.</HI></P>
<P>There are several Statues, both at <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> in the City, and at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Statues.</NOTE> the <HI>Exchange,</HI> but my <HI>Relish</HI> being not for <HI>Art</HI> but <HI>Nature,</HI> as I have before declared, I think fit to meddle with 'em, as little as I can.</P>
<P>I happen'd to go with a Lady to <HI>Hide Park Corner,</HI> where in an open <NOTE PLACE="marg">Naked Statues Com|mended at Hide-Park Cor|ner. <HI>P. 29. P.</HI> 30.</NOTE> <HI>Area,</HI> we saw several Naked Statues, at which she <HI>out of a fond humour, or hoc sit of Devotion,</HI> took some offence. I told her, <HI>Cicero somewhere says, that some of the ancient wise men thought there was nothing naturally obscene, but that every thing might be call'd by its own name;</HI> she told me I was making an Apology for talking obscencely. I reply'd no, but added, <HI>Why should Nu|dity</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 30.</NOTE> <HI>be so offensive since a very great part of the World yet defies Cloaths, and ever did so; and the parts they do most affect to cover, are from a certain necessity</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 30. P. 31.</NOTE> <HI>only:</HI> At which she blush'd, and I for the sake of further Discourse begun a long story about Roman Cloths, and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
told her, <HI>a Roman was as soon undress'd</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 31.</NOTE> <HI>as I can put of my Gloves and Shooes. For he had nothing to do but to loose the Gir|dle of the Tunica, and to draw up both his Arms from under the Tunica,</HI> and he was in Bed immediately, whereas I had a hundred fatigues to undergo, as un|buttoning by Collar, untying my Knee|strings; and several other things that would make a Man impatient to think of. I told her likewise it was <HI>after the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flannel Shirts found out at Rome. <HI>P.</HI> 31. 32. No Steen|kirks at Rome.</NOTE> <HI>first Ages of the Commonwealth,</HI> that they found out the invention <HI>of putting a Shirt next the Skin;</HI> that as for Ruffles and Steenkirks, <HI>they were never added in the very Splendor and Luxury of the Empire.</HI> I continued my Dis|course, that I, <HI>much admire I could never meet with a Statue in</HI> London, <HI>but what was Cloathed with a</HI> Toga pura <HI>and no representation of a Bullated one.</HI> I told her, that the <HI>Romans</HI> indeed <HI>wore Flan|nel Shirts, but in my mind a fair Lin|nen</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 33. Com|mendati|on of Linnen Shirts.</NOTE> <HI>Shirt every Day, is as great a preser|vative to Neatness and Cleanness of the Skin,</HI> as going to the Bagnio, <HI>was to the Romans.</HI> The Lady smil'd and told me, Sir, I am glad you have Cloth'd the poor Creatures, that we
<PB N="14" REF="13">
found Naked. This seeming to be spoke in a Ridiculous way, something provo|ked me, but <HI>spying a little State of</HI> Mo|ther <HI>Shipton,</HI> whose Face <HI>was deep with|in the Quoifure;</HI> says I, Madam, this Woman looks as if she were <HI>ashamed of her Cheat:</HI> It was the fancy of King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th</HI>'s time <HI>to make Old Wo|men Prophetesses,</HI> but I think to make <HI>them Sagae and Veneficae,</HI> (that is in plain English Sorceresses and Poisoners) is <HI>reasonable enough, for Age makes all Peo|ple Spiteful, but more the weaker Sex.</HI> So <NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Wo|men Wit|ches. <HI>P.</HI> 34.</NOTE> we parted in chagrin, for I believe the Lady Modestly speaking, was up|wards of fifty.</P>
<P>I heard of several Persons that had great Collections of Rarities, Pictures, and Statues. But I was resolved to Visit but a few, and those the most <HI>Cu|rious;</HI> and when I made any Observa|tions, that they should be to the pur|pose.</P>

He proffer'd to shew me the new Armory, in which are Arms, as he told me, for above a Hundred Thousand Men, all dispos'd in a manner, most surprizing and magnificent; as likewise another Armory, where are Arms for Twenty Thousand Men more. He would like|wise have shew'd me the Horse Armo|ry, a Royal Train of Artillery, and several Cannon taken out of the <HI>Tri|dent</HI> Prize.
