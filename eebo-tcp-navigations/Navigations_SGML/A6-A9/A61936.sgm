<HEAD>TO THE LEARNED Dr. <HI>Martin Li&s;ter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme ill natured and unthinking Ani|mals having imbib'd an Opinion that your only De&s;ign in publi&s;hing your Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> was to flatter the <HI>French</HI> and di&s;parage the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they made, you know, very undecent Reflections upon that Treati&s;e, repre&s;ented your Wor&s;hip as a &s;hort &s;ighted, prejudiced Ob&s;erver, and one that had a greater E&s;teem and Veneration for <HI>Paris</HI> than the famous City of <HI>London:</HI> Which in re&s;pect of its healthful and plea&s;ant Situa|tion, &s;plendid and uniform Buildings, Hou&s;es and Shops richly Furni&s;hed, wealthy Mer|chants and Trade&s;men, and excellency of its
<PB REF="3">Government, is Celebrated as a <HI>Non-Pareil</HI> through the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>But, Sir, as Ignorance is the Parent of Mi&s;under&s;tanding, &s;o they were unhappily led into this Mi&s;take for want of Brains to comprehend your Method in commending and di&s;prai&s;ing. For your Abilities in Hi|&s;tory, like the other parts of your great Learning, lying very deep, and out of the Vulgar Track, it is not di&s;cernible to every Pur-blind Eye: Whereas better illuminated Apprehen&s;ions ea&s;ily perceiv'd your Inclina|tion was to give the Preference for <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h-men;</HI> for when you &s;pake of the <HI>French</HI> City and People, your Elogies were Satyrs, your Panegyricks Lampoons, and you always unluckily brought in &s;omething that di&s;parag'd what you &s;eem'd to advance, and clouded all the Glory that was thought you intended them in the publication of your Journey.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you &s;ay the <HI>French</HI> Gentry <HI>are ve|ry Civil and Obliging,</HI> and I believe no le&s;s, though you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>They value them&s;elves upon their Court&s;hip, and in making a Leg and Bow better than the re&s;t of Mankind: Building and Dre&s;&s;ing mo&s;tly for Figure, and that their principal Diver&s;ions are only to &s;ee and be &s;een;</HI> and this I think, Sir, your Enemies will allow to be no extraordinary Chara|cter.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>You acquaint us, Sir, <HI>That their Hou&s;es are richly furni&s;hed; for they have generally from five to ten di&s;tinct Families under every Roof, that the Inhabitants are wealthy in Pictures,</HI> and have the Curio&s;ity and Ingenuity <HI>to Ruin them&s;elves in that kind of expen&s;ive Furniture:</HI> Which would be thought a vanity in others; but this, Doctor, is your peculiar knack in com|mending their Oeconomy.</P>
<P><HI>The Buildings in</HI> Paris, you &s;ay, <HI>are very fine, built with rough Stone, Plai&s;ter'd over, and Colour'd to make them look like Brick; but at longe&s;t, will not &s;tand above five and twenty Years,</HI> and then they have the plea&s;ure of building new ones, which mu&s;t needs be a great &s;atisfaction to the Proprietors.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> in your Opinion, Sir, <HI>is more Popu|lous than</HI> London, <HI>but it &s;eems 'tis only in ap|pearance, becau&s;e the Palaces and Convents have eat up the Peoples Dwellings, and crowded them &s;o exce&s;&s;ively together in the Trading parts of the Town, that they &s;eem more numerous than they are; whereas the Arti&s;ts and Trade&s;men in</HI> Lon|don <HI>and</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter <HI>have purcha&s;ed the No|blemens Palaces, and converted them into Shops and private Dwellings. The lower Windows in</HI> Paris <HI>are grated with &s;trong Iron Bars before 'em.</HI> But are excelled in that particular al&s;o, if you had thought upon't by the two &s;tately Hou&s;es over the two <HI>We&s;t</HI> Gates of <HI>London.</HI> You &s;ay al&s;o <HI>That</HI> Paris <HI>is a beautiful and convenient
<PB REF="4">City but the Streets are very narrow, extreamly dirty, and the Pa&s;&s;engers on foot no way &s;ecured from the hurry and danger of Coaches.</HI></P>
<P>Above all, <HI>You &s;ay their Gardens are very cu|rious things,</HI> and well they may be &s;o, for you are plea&s;ed to add as a Character of their Gal|lantry, <HI>That as &s;oon as a</HI> Frenchman <HI>gets any thing by Fortune or Inheritance, he will lay it out upon a Picture, or an Ornament for his Garden: Though many Uten&s;ils and Conveniencies of Life are wanting to him which are common in</HI> En|gland.</P>
<P><HI>Their Food in general,</HI> you &s;ay, <HI>Is cour&s;e Bread and Lettice, but that indifferent Aliment is &s;up|ply'd with plenty of Sauce, for you tell us they have abundance of Onions, Leeks, Garlick, Sor|rel, Shallot, Rocombo's and Mu&s;hrooms. Their Hackney-Coaches and Chairs are the mo&s;t na&s;ty and mi&s;erable Voiture [Carriage] that can be, and yet are as dear again as in</HI> London; but that misfortune you &s;ay, <HI>is &s;upply'd by a wor&s;e,</HI> viz. <HI>The</HI> Vingrette, <HI>which is a Coach with two Wheels, dragg'd by a Man, and pu&s;h'd be|hind by a Woman or a Boy, and &s;ometimes by both,</HI> which you truly &s;ay <HI>is a wretched bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;o magnificent a City.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Their Bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>make the be&s;t Figure in the Town in their Equipages and Liveries, but not in re&s;pect of their Learning;</HI> for you are plea&s;ed to add, <HI>That Learning is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Qualification there, as with us in</HI> England.
<PB REF="4"><HI>Their Churches are numerous, but not big, and very few of them have either Towers or Steeples, though they are the Glory of a Pro&s;pect;</HI> but at length, Sir, you are plea&s;ed to credit the <HI>French,</HI> and gratifie your Enemies, in &s;aying, <HI>They have more manners and Religion than the</HI> Engli&s;h; for which, &s;ome of your Country-men are re&s;olv'd never to forgive you, though I think they ju&s;tly ought, for the Characters you be&s;tow on their Monks. <HI>Who wear,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>the Ru&s;tick Habits of old Times, without Shirts, or other Linnen Orna|ments of the pre&s;ent Age. That wantonly Per&s;e|cute them&s;elves to do violence to Chri&s;tianity. That feed upon &s;owre Herbs, Fi&s;h, and &s;uch kind of Tra&s;h, and lie wor&s;e, always rough and upon Boards; go bare foot in a cold Country; deny them&s;elves the Comforts of this Life, and wear out their days in a &s;lavi&s;h and fruitle&s;s Devotion.</HI> And this I think may at one for what your Back Friends call an odious Compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus far, dear Doctor, I have been your Compurgator, and clear'd you from the &s;u|&s;picion of being more a <HI>French-man</HI> than an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> which might have been prejudi|cial to your Practice: And now am become an humble Suitor to you, that &s;ince a Friend that is gone a long Journey has oblig'd me with a Succinct and Plea&s;ant View of &s;ome parts of <HI>France;</HI> and largely Supplies in Words at length, where you mince the Mat|ter, that you would plea&s;e to take it into
<PB REF="5">your Protection, and give it the Honour of being Bound up as a Supplement with your <HI>Journey to Paris,</HI> and you will much oblige,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE notice of a happy Peace after &s;o tedious a War, tempting our Curi|o&s;ity to take a view of <HI>France,</HI> of which we have had &s;uch different Relations; my &s;elf, with &s;everal other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|men, embark'd at <HI>Dover</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> the plea&s;an|te&s;t Month of the Year, with a fair South We&s;t Wind, which had it continued in that Point, would &s;oon have wafted us to the <HI>Galick</HI> Shoar; but a little toward Night it veering more about to the We&s;t, and the Tide not befriending us, our Pa&s;&s;age became tedious and trouble&s;om to &s;uch Fre&s;h-water Sailers, and we had lei&s;ure to &s;ee the &s;welling Waves, by an inbred Ambition, &s;trive which &s;hould be the highe&s;t; while our Ve&s;&s;el by
<PB N="2" REF="6">a violent agitation of the Wind danc'd a nimble <HI>Galiard</HI> on the Billows; but that which made the generality of the Pa&s;&s;engers in a very unea&s;y condition, and the Deck and Cabins look like &s;o many <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> fill'd with di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons; made the <HI>Scaly</HI> Inhabitants of that <HI>Watry Kingdom</HI> &s;port them|&s;elves on the &s;urface of the Waves, and dance about our Ketch as if &s;he had been a mov|ing <HI>May-Pole,</HI> and acted their Mea&s;ures with &s;uch a delightful <HI>Decorum,</HI> as if they had been taught to <HI>Caper</HI> by the be&s;t of <HI>French</HI> Dancing Ma&s;ters. The next <HI>Ebb</HI> brought us within &s;ight of the Sea Coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A De&s;crip|tion of</HI> Norman|dy.</NOTE> a Shoar &s;o evenly compo&s;ed and levelled, that it looks like the work of <HI>Art,</HI> and not of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Inhabitants of this Country came
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Anno 800.</NOTE> Originally from <HI>Norway,</HI> Soldiers of For|tune, and &s;o terribly &s;poil'd the Maritine Coa&s;ts of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> that, <HI>A furore Normannorum</HI> was in&s;erted into the <HI>Letany;</HI> but now being Conquer'd by the <HI>French,</HI> and en&s;laved under that Monar|chy, they are utterly cre&s;t fallen, have lo&s;t both their <HI>Courage</HI> and their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and nothing remains among them now of their Progenitors, but a penurious <HI>Pride,</HI> and an ungovernable <HI>Surline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The next Tide landed us at <HI>Deipe</HI> in <HI>Nor|mandy.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town of</HI> Diepe.</NOTE> A Town &s;eated on an Arm of the Sea, between two Hills, which are a Security to the <HI>Harbour,</HI> and a Strength to the <HI>Town;</HI> but avail'd them little again&s;t the <HI>Courage</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the Force of their <HI>Bombs,</HI> who&s;e Injuries they were now Repairing. The
<PB N="3" REF="6">number of the Inhabitants were formerly ac|counted about 30000, whereof 9000 of them were of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion;</HI> and the Church of <HI>Argues,</HI> a Village about two Miles from <HI>Deipe</HI> was allowed them for the Exerci&s;e of their Religion; but &s;ince the <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> they are all di&s;per&s;ed, and the want of them greatly Lamented.</P>
<P>Here we were Eye Witne&s;&s;es of the <HI>Idola|try</HI> of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popi&s;h Ido|latry.</NOTE> in paying <HI>divine Honour</HI> to things <HI>Inanimate:</HI> We &s;aw the <HI>Hoa&s;t</HI> or <HI>Sacrament</HI> carried through the Streets, by a couple of <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> under a <HI>Canopy,</HI> u&s;her'd by two or three <HI>Torches,</HI> and followed by a Com|pany of <HI>Idle</HI> Boys and old People: Before it, was carried a <HI>Bell</HI> continually <HI>Tinkling,</HI> to warn the People that their <HI>God</HI> was carrying by, and expected their <HI>Reverence,</HI> which was paid by all that met it, by falling on their <HI>Knees,</HI> Rai&s;ing their <HI>Heads,</HI> and giving it <HI>Honour:</HI> Tho' methinks not with &s;o much Devotion, as I &s;hould have done, if I had be|lieved it, as they do, to be the <HI>Body</HI> of my <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>But I find its the Common practice of this Country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tra|velling Chariots and Hor&s;es.</NOTE> for the <HI>Laity</HI> as well as the <HI>Clergy</HI> to impo&s;e upon Mens <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tandings;</HI> for we de&s;igning to Travel towards <HI>Rouen,</HI> and Hor&s;es being not to be had for Money, and the <HI>War</HI> between the two Nations, and the Ruins of <HI>Deipe,</HI> were &s;o fre&s;h in their Me|mories we could not expect them for <HI>Love,</HI> we were forc'd to make u&s;e of the common Conveyance, and that was in a <HI>Cart;</HI> but for fear of Offending, for&s;ooth, in &s;pite of our Teeths, tho' we &s;aw it was a <HI>Cart,</HI> we mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="7">call it <HI>Une Chariot,</HI> and to plea&s;e them &s;o we did, tho' we thought it fit for no <HI>Tri|umph,</HI> but that of a <HI>French-man.</HI> To this <HI>Cart</HI> (Chariot I mean) were fa&s;tened three things, that had been <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> in their time, but were now skelitoniz'd into Carca&s;es, or Images of Hor&s;es, without life or motion. When we were mounted they began to Crawl, for go they could not, however it convinc'd me they had life, tho' I thought it would hold out no longer, than to carry them to the next Pack of Hounds. Thus ac|commodated <HI>A la mode de France,</HI> we took our leaves of <HI>Deipe,</HI> and wagg'd &s;o &s;lowly towards <HI>Roven,</HI> that we thought our Journey was a perfect Emblem of the motion of the <HI>Ninth Sphere,</HI> which was Forty Nine Thou&s;and Years in fini&s;hing; but this was not all our Calami|ty; the <HI>Rain</HI> fell on us through our <HI>Tilt,</HI> which for the many Holes in it, might more truly have been call'd a <HI>Net.</HI> The <HI>Dirt</HI> broke plenti|fully upon us, through the <HI>Rails</HI> of our <HI>Chariot,</HI> and the unproportionable pace of it, &s;tarted al|mo&s;t every <HI>Bone</HI> of our Bodies. I wonder how a <HI>French-man,</HI> that commonly carries the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> of his Country about him, dur&s;t ad|venture his cra&s;y Carca&s;s in it. Thus we endu|red all the infelicities of a Journey, and e&s;caped three &s;everal <HI>Deaths,</HI> Drowning, Choaking with Mire, and Breaking of the Wheel; be&s;ides the fear of being <HI>Fami&s;h'd</HI> before we came to our <HI>Inn,</HI> which was &s;ix <HI>French</HI> Miles from us.</P>
<P>Not to mention the <HI>Beggarly</HI> Villages we dragled through,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town and the Inn at</HI> To&s;tes.</NOTE> we came at la&s;t to <HI>To&s;tes,</HI> the place de&s;tin'd for our Lodging; a Town like the <HI>Wor&s;er</HI> &s;ort of our Market Towns in
<PB N="5" REF="7"><HI>England.</HI> There our <HI>Chariotier</HI> brought us to the <HI>Ruins</HI> of a Hou&s;e, an <HI>Alehou&s;e</HI> I would &s;carce have thought it, but in complement to the Nation, it mu&s;t be cald an <HI>Inn;</HI> yes, and an Honourable one too, as <HI>Don Quixots</HI> Ho&s;t told him. De&s;pair of finding in this <HI>Na&s;ty hole,</HI> either Bedding or Victuals, I was in the Mans mind that cho&s;e <HI>Hanging,</HI> rather than Marry a foul Queen that Beg'd him; and was often ready to &s;ay, <HI>Drive on Carman.</HI> The truth on't is, I fell out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire.</P>
<P>A Cour&s;e Fac'd <HI>Tatterdemalion</HI> belonging to the Hou&s;e,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cham|ber.</NOTE> brought us into a Room as <HI>Dark</HI> and as <HI>Damp</HI> as a <HI>Charnel-Hou&s;e;</HI> only toward the <HI>Orchard</HI> there was a Melancholy kind of a <HI>Hole,</HI> which in Days of <HI>Yore,</HI> had been a <HI>Window,</HI> but now both Frame and Gla&s;s were vani&s;h'd: However by the <HI>Light</HI> that came in, I could ea&s;ily perceive I was not in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Chamber were three Beds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bedds and Sheets.</NOTE> if it be Lawful to call them &s;o, that were bottom'd with <HI>Straw,</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely &s;queez'd together, that the <HI>Wool-Packs,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lords,</HI> in re&s;pect of the&s;e were <HI>Swans-Down.</HI> On this Straw <HI>Huddle</HI> lay a Medly of <HI>Flocks</HI> and <HI>Feathers,</HI> &s;ewed up in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ca&s;t <HI>Hop-Sack&punc;</HI> &s;o ill ordered, that they &s;tuck up like the <HI>Knobbs</HI> of a Crab-Tree <HI>Cudgel,</HI> and we were obliged to our <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> that one Nights Lodg|ing did not wear our <HI>Bones</HI> out. The <HI>Sheets</HI> they brought us, were &s;o <HI>Cour&s;e,</HI> that in my Con&s;cience, a Sailer would have refu&s;ed them for a <HI>Hammock,</HI> and I heartily wi&s;h'd I could have exchang'd them for an <HI>Engli&s;h Hor&s;e-Cloath;</HI>

<P>The <HI>Table Linnen</HI> was of the &s;ame Com|plexion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Table Linnen.</NOTE> &s;o <HI>Foul</HI> and <HI>Dirty,</HI> that I could not think it had been wa&s;h'd above once, &s;ince it grew in the Hemp ground, and yet the poor things had as brisk a <HI>French</HI> Air, as if they had been promi&s;ed for the next whole Year, to e&s;cape a <HI>Scouring.</HI> By this De&s;cription of an <HI>Inn,</HI> you may gue&s;s Sir, at all the re&s;t in <HI>France.</HI> Some are not altogether &s;o wretch|ed, yet the alteration is almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Let us now walk into the <HI>Kitchin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kitch|ing and Provi&s;ion for Supper.</NOTE> and &s;ee what's for <HI>Supper,</HI> and here, Sir, we found a mo&s;t terrible <HI>Execution,</HI> committed upon the body of a Pullet. Our <HI>Ho&s;te&s;s,</HI> cruel Woman as &s;he was, had cut the Throat of it, and without plucking off the <HI>Feathers,</HI> tore it into pieces, and then took off the <HI>Skin</HI> and <HI>Feathers</HI> together, as we &s;trip <HI>Rabbets</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> clapt it into a <HI>Pan,</HI> and <HI>Frica&s;ized</HI> it into a <HI>Supper.</HI></P>
<P>After which Repa&s;t we had a Sight of our <HI>Ho&s;te&s;s,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ho&s;tes and her Daughter.</NOTE> and her <HI>Daughter,</HI> at which we ble&s;t our Souls, and march off, le&s;t the ful&s;om in|terview &s;hould have brought up what we had eaten; for &s;uch a couple of <HI>dirty Queans</HI> was never &s;een in <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s in a <HI>Du&s;t Cart,</HI> or among the Gold Finders at Mid|night. <HI>Horace</HI>'s Salutation, <HI>O mater pulchra filia pulchrior,</HI> was never &s;o &s;ea&s;onable as here.

<P>Now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Journey towards</HI> Orleans.</NOTE> being almo&s;t choak'd with the noi|&s;omne&s;s of <HI>Paris,</HI> we took our Journey to|wards <HI>Orleans.</HI> The Day was fair, and not &s;o much as di&s;pos'd to a Cloud, &s;ave that a|bout Noon they began to &s;pread like a Cur|tain, to defend us from the Injury of the Sun, and the Wind rather &s;ufficient to fan the Air than di&s;turb it.

<P>Having cram'd our &s;elves into our Wag|gon, we took a &s;hort farewel of <HI>Paris,</HI> joy|ful that we liv'd to &s;ee the beauty of the Fields again, and to enjoy the happine&s;s of a free and clear Heaven.

<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Paris</HI> is the Town of <HI>Mont l' Herrie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mont l' Herrie.</NOTE> wherein was nothing ob&s;er|vable but the Carca&s;s of a Ca&s;tle, and a Plain about it, where was fought that memorable Battle between <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. and <HI>Charles the Har|dy,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> where each Army run away, leaving the Field empty of Forces, and yet neither of the Princes Victorious. Some &s;cour'd away out of fear to Die, and &s;ome out of hope to Live, that it was hard to &s;ay, which of the Soldiers made mo&s;t u&s;e of their Heels in the Combat.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Mont l' Herrie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cha&s;tres.</NOTE> is the Town of <HI>Cha&s;tres,</HI> &s;eated in the faire&s;t An|gle of <HI>France,</HI> where it confines to <HI>La Beau&s;s,</HI> a Town of an ordinary &s;ize, &s;omewhat bigger than for a Market, and too little for a City. It has a Wall and a Ditch, but neither further &s;erviceable than to re&s;i&s;t the Enemy at one Gate, while the People run away at the other.</P>
<P>Over a little River which might be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken for a Ditch,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;tampes.</NOTE> lies the Country <HI>La
<PB N="47" REF="28">Beau&s;s,</HI> through which we Travel'd till the &s;ame Night we came to <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> a Town &s;ituate in a plentiful Soil, and water'd with a River of the &s;ame Name, which affords the be&s;t <HI>Crevices.</HI> It &s;eems to have been a Town of &s;ome con&s;ideration formerly, as we might read in its Ruins. Without the Town is a fine green Meadow, where they u&s;e their Re|creations. At my being there, Sir, the Sport was Dancing, an Exerci&s;e the <HI>French</HI> much delight in, and it &s;eems this Natural Inclinati|on is &s;o rooted in them, that neither Age not the ab&s;ence of a Fortune can prevail again&s;t it. On this Dancing Green were a&s;&s;embled not only Youth and Gentry, but Old Age and Beggary. Old Wives that could &s;carce &s;et Foot to the Ground without a Crutch in the Street, here taught their Feet to amble, and you would have thought by the cleanly Conveyance and Carriage of their Bodies, they had been troubled with the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> and yet were &s;o eager in the Sport as if their Dan|cing days would never be over. Some were &s;o Ragged, that a &s;wift <HI>Galiard</HI> would almo&s;t have &s;hak'd them into Nakedne&s;s. To have attempted &s;taying them at home, or per&s;wad|ing them to work when they heard the noi&s;e of a Fiddle, had been a Task too unweildy for <HI>Hercules.</HI> In this mixture of Age and Con|dition, we ob&s;erv'd them in their Pa&s;times, the Rags being &s;o interwoven with Silks, and wrinkl'd Brows &s;o intermingled with their fre&s;h Beauties, that you would have thought it a Mummery of Fortunes; as for tho&s;e of both Sexes which were altogether pa&s;t Acti|on,
<PB N="48" REF="29">they were brought thither in Chairs, and trod the Dancing Mea&s;ures with their Eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inn</HI> we lay in was ju&s;t like tho&s;e of <HI>Normandy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way of Beg|ging in an Inn.</NOTE> and all the difference we found was in the Morning; for there we were not troubled with &s;uch importunate Begging as in that Country.

A &s;weeter and more generous kind of Cra|ving than u&s;ed in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and &s;uch as im|ply'd a lucky Contradiction; for what is it el&s;e, that a Maid &s;hould offer her &s;elf to be Deflowr'd without prejudice to her Mode&s;ty, and rai&s;e a Fortune for her future Husband by the U&s;ury of a Kindne&s;s?</P>
<P>Refre&s;h'd with the&s;e Favours,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anger|ville.</NOTE> we took our leaves of <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> and the Dancing Mi&s;cella|ny, jogging on through many a beautiful Field of Corn till we came to <HI>Angerville,</HI> which was &s;ix Leagues di&s;tant. Here was nothing memorable, but that the Town had been taken by <HI>Mountacute,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> as he went this way to the Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> The &s;ame Fate befel <HI>Touray,</HI> a Place not much beyond it in &s;trength or bigne&s;s, only it had more confidence (as Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman once &s;aid) in the Walls of Bones that were within it, than in the Walls of Stones which were without it.</P>
<P>This Town &s;tands in the midway betwixt <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> and <HI>Orleans,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Enter|tainment at Dinner.</NOTE> and therefore a fit Stage to Act a Dinner on; and to it we went.
<PB N="49" REF="29">By that time we had clear'd our Selves of a great platter of Pottage, there entred upon us three odd kind of Fellows with their Hats on their Heads like cover'd Di&s;hes. As &s;oon as I &s;aw them, I ca&s;t one Eye upon my Ri|ding-Coat, and the other upon my Whinyard, not knowing what u&s;e I might have of my Steel to &s;ecure my Drapery; but when I had Survey'd their Apparel, I quickly altered that Opinion, and look'd upon them as the Excre|ments of the next Gaol. Deceiv'd alike in both my Jealou&s;ies, on a nearer view I per|ceiv'd their diverti&s;ing parcel of Man's Fle&s;h, in good truth, were neither better nor wor&s;e than errant <HI>French</HI> Fidlers, which in <HI>England</HI> we &s;hould have thought unworthy of a Whip|ing-Po&s;t. Without asking Leave, or paying any Reverence to the Company, they fell a &s;crap|ing in as har&s;h a Tone as the Courting of Cats at Mid-night, and as if that had not been Puni&s;hment enough, they abu&s;ed our Ears with one of their Songs. By that little <HI>French</HI> I had, and the Simpering of a <HI>Fille de Joy</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> that Travelled in our Company, I perceiv'd it was Baudy, and to &s;ay the truth, Ranker than could be endur'd by any thing but a <HI>French-man;</HI> but what could I do? I had not <HI>French</HI> enough to call them Rogues hand&s;omly, and the Scoundrels were below a Beating. A Gang of Ra&s;cals &s;o infi|nitely inferior to the Dignity of a Statute, that to Hang them, had been but to ca&s;t away a Rope, and di&s;parage the Reputation of the Gallows.</P>
<P>After their &s;mutty Song was ended, one of the Hanging-look'd Company, which after|ward
<PB N="50" REF="30">appear'd to be Ma&s;ter of the Mi&s;-rule, pull'd a Di&s;h out of his Codpi&s;s ,and &s;ets it upon the Table before us, into which, according to the <HI>French</HI> Cu&s;tom, we mu&s;t ca&s;t in our Bene|volence. Pre&s;cription <HI>Time out of Mind,</HI> has allow'd them a <HI>Sou</HI> for each Man at the Table, more they don't expect, and will take no le&s;s; no great Sum I confe&s;s, but 'twas richly worth the Mu&s;ick, which was meerly <HI>French,</HI> La&s;civious in Words, and Unskilful in the Playing.</P>
<P>We are now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> Orleans.</NOTE> Sir, come into the Country of <HI>Orleans,</HI> which, though within the Limits of <HI>La Beau&s;s,</HI> will be thought to be a Pro|vince of it &s;elf.

It is very Po|pulous, the delicacy of the Air, and the com|modiou&s;ne&s;s of the River, inviting the Nobi|lity and Gentry to Cohabit in it, and they ac|cept it, and are a more Humane and Courte|ous &s;ort of People than the <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> or any other in <HI>France</HI> that I have yet conver&s;ed with.

It could &s;carce be called an Univer&s;ity, till the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> came among them, but rather a School of Law; but they having brought with them tho&s;e Branches of Learning, which before, were wanting in it, it may better de&s;erve that Appellation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> I &s;ay, have a College here,

That time which others &s;pend at their High-Ma&s;&s;es, and Canonical Hours, the&s;e Men be&s;tow upon their Books, being exempted from the&s;e Duties by their

<P>To this advantage of Lei&s;ure,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their me|thod in Teaching.</NOTE> they add an exact Method in their Teaching, which in|deed is &s;o excellent, that <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> often|times &s;end their Sons to their Schools to have them prove Exqui&s;ite in the Arts they Teach.

The Year ended, he re|moves him&s;elf and his Scholars with him, in|to the Cla&s;s or School next above him, till he has brought them through the whole Stu|dy of Humanity. In the la&s;t Form, which is that of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> he continues two Years, which being expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Univer&s;ality of Learning, are Manumitted from their Tutors, and permit|ted to follow their private Studies, but that
<PB N="57" REF="33">which is their greate&s;t Art in Teaching, and fitte&s;t for their purpo&s;e, is,</P>
<P>That they do not only teach their Scholars an exactne&s;s in tho&s;e parts of Learn|ing which they handle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ob&s;ti|nate Hu|mour.</NOTE> but endeavour to breed in them an ob&s;tinacy of Mind, and a &s;turdy eagerne&s;s of Spirit, that may render them hot and fiery Pro&s;ecutors of their own Principles, and impatient of Contradiction. This I have ob&s;erved makes all of their Edu|cation to affect Victory in all their Contro|ver&s;ies of Wit and Knowledge, and manage it with &s;uch a Violence, that even in their Grammatical Di&s;putations, little Boys will maintain their Arguments with &s;uch a fierce|ne&s;s and impatience, as &s;urmounts their ten|der Years. And all this pains the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> take for nothing.

<PB N="59" REF="34">and two Friars of the Order of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> we had the perpetual vexation of four Trade&s;|men of <HI>Paris,</HI> two <HI>Filles de Joy,</HI> and an old Woman.</P>

The re&s;t like <GAP DESC="blank"> in <HI>London,</HI> were always babling about who were the fitte&s;t Men in the City to be <HI>E&s;chevins,</HI> Sheriffs for the Year en&s;uing.</P>
<P>Of the two Wenches one was &s;o extreamly impudent,

Since I fir&s;t knew Mankind and the World, I never ob&s;erved &s;o much impudence in general, as I did then in that young na&s;ty <HI>French</HI> Whore, and I hope, I &s;hall never be &s;o mi&s;erable as to &s;uffer two Days more the Torment of her Conver&s;ation. In a Word, &s;he was a Gilt born to &s;hame all the Fryars &s;he had Traded with. The other Female, for I dare not call them Women, was of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, but not half &s;o Rampant as her lewd Companion; for in re|&s;pect of her, a Charitable Stranger would have thought her Hone&s;t.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An old Wo|man.</NOTE> The old Woman
<PB N="60" REF="35">was &s;o very old, that 'twas a Que&s;tion whe|ther &s;he had ever been young or not. It was well I had read the Scripture, otherwi&s;e I might have thought her one of the fir&s;t pieces of the Creation, that by &s;ome mi&s;chance had e&s;cap'd the Deluge. Her Face was like that of the Sybil <HI>Erythraea</HI> in &s;ome old Print before a Ballad, or one of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s two Harlots in a Painted Cloath over the Chimney in a Coun|try Ale-hou&s;e, or like one of the Relicks of the fir&s;t Age after the building of <HI>Babel,</HI> for her Complexion was a more dreadful Confu&s;i|on than that of Languages.

<P>Thus A&s;&s;ociated,

A Ca&s;tle it once had, but now that defect is &s;upply'd by Mounts and Ba&s;tions large and capacious, which, if well Man'd, need nor yield upon the fir&s;t Summons. Without the Wall it is diver&s;ly &s;trengthned, in &s;ome places with deep Ditches full of Water; the others only by a Boggi&s;h, Mari&s;h, Fenny Level, more dangerous to an Enemy, and &s;erviceable to the Town than all the re&s;t of its Fortifications, and therefore never guarded by the Soldters of the Garri&s;on. They only keep Guard at <HI>Port de Boys,</HI> and <HI>Port St. Valery,</HI> the fir&s;t looks towards <HI>He&s;den,</HI> a Frontier Town of <HI>Artois,</HI> and the other towards the Haven of St. <HI>Valery,</HI> from which Places mo&s;t danger was fear'd.</P>

<P><HI>July</HI> the la&s;t, we took Po&s;t-Hor&s;es,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Jour|ney to</HI> Bul|logn <HI>on Po&s;t-Hor&s;es</HI></NOTE> or things very like them, for <HI>Bulloign;</HI> as lean and poor were the Steeds, as Envy in the <HI>Poet, Maries in corpora tota</HI> was their Chara|cter; for you might not only have counted their Ribs, but the Spur-galls had made &s;uch Ca&s;ements through their Skins, that you might have Survey'd their Intrails, and given a better Account of the po&s;ition of their Guts and Piping Lungs than <HI>Le Grey,</HI> or <HI>Mark|ham</HI> in their Ma&s;ter-Pieces. A &s;trange kind of Cattle in my Opinion they were, and &s;uch as had neither Fle&s;h on their Bones, Skin on their Fle&s;h, nor &s;carce Hair on their Skins. Sure I am, they were no Kin to <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Hor&s;es of the Sun, nor could we &s;ay of them, <HI>Flam|miferis implent hinnitibus auras.</HI> For all the Neighing we could hear from the Proude&s;t of them, was only an old dry Cough, which they brought from the late Campagne in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> which in earne&s;t, was a great comfort to me, for by that noi&s;e I perceived there was &s;ome Life in them. Upon &s;uch Skeletons of Hor&s;es, or heaps of Bones did I or my Com|panions never &s;ee our &s;elves before; and yet the Mon&s;ieurs that Travel'd with us, thought them&s;elves well Mounted, and cock'd and look'd as great as the little Gentleman that Rides in Triumph before the Bears and Bag-Pipes in <HI>London,</HI> and almo&s;t &s;cratched their Behinds as often.</P>
<P>When we expected, however to find &s;ome|thing of the Po&s;t in them, having Brib'd them on both &s;ides, they began to move in an <HI>Al|derman</HI>'s pace, or like Envy in <HI>Ovid.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="39">
<Q><L><HI>Surgit humi pigre, pa&s;&s;uque incedet inerti.</HI></L></Q> and out of this Melancholy Gravity no per|&s;wa&s;ion could urge them; the dull Jades were grown in&s;en&s;ible of the Spur, and to hearten them with Wands would in a &s;hort time have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Country for want of Wood. Now was the Cart at <HI>Diepe</HI> thought a &s;peedy Conveyance, and we envy'd the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e that were ble&s;&s;ed with a Wag|gon, though it came with the hazard of the old Wife, and the two &s;mutty Wenches. If good Nature or a Fright in the Journey did ever put any of them into a pace like a Gal|lop, we were &s;ure to have them Tire in the middle of our Stage, and put us with our own Feet to mea&s;ure out the re&s;t of our Jour|ney. Weary of this Trade, I made bold to di&s;mount the Po&s;tilion, and a&s;cended the Trunk-Hor&s;e, where I &s;ate in &s;uch a Magni|ficent Po&s;ture, that the be&s;t Carrier in <HI>Paris</HI> would have envy'd my Felicity. Behind me I had a good large Trunk and a Portmantle, before me a bundle of Cloaks, and a parcel of Books. So that if my Stirrups could poize me equally on both fides, I could not fall backwards nor forwards. Thus preferred, I encouraged my fellow Travellers, who ca&s;t many an envious Eye upon my happine&s;s, and there was not one of them that might not ju&s;t|ly have &s;aid of me, <HI>Tu as un Millieur temps que le Pape,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;tre|ville <HI>and its Garri|&s;on.</HI></NOTE> Thou ha&s;t a better time on't than the Pope in all his Grandeur.</P>
<P>On the Right Hand, and almo&s;t in the Midway between <HI>Abbeville</HI> and <HI>Bulloign</HI> we
<PB N="69" REF="39">left the Town of <HI>Mon&s;treville,</HI> which we had no lei&s;ure (than our Hor&s;es) to vi&s;it. It is conveniently &s;eated either for command or re&s;i&s;tance, being built upon the top and de|clivity of a Hill, well Fortified with Ba&s;tions and Ramparts on the out&s;ide, and within has a good Garri&s;on of Soldiers. And indeed it concerns the King of <HI>France</HI> to look well to this important Place, being a border Town, within two Miles of <HI>Artois,</HI> and the taking of it would cut off all Intercour&s;e between the Countries of <HI>Bulloign</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> with the re&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and of the like con&s;ideration are the Towns of <HI>Abbeville, Amiens</HI> and St. <HI>Quintin.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the Country of <HI>Bullin|nois,</HI> which, though a part of <HI>Picardy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulloign.</NOTE> di&s;|dains to be counted &s;o, and will be e&s;teemed as a Country of it &s;elf. It comprehends <HI>Bul|loin, E&s;capes, Neuf-Cha&s;tel,</HI> and divers little Villages, and con&s;i&s;ts of Hills and Valleys af|ter the manner of <HI>England.</HI> Nor is it only a Country of it &s;elf, but in a manner a free Coun|try; for it is held immediately of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who without Que&s;tion is a very Gra|cious Land-Lady, for her Tenants enjoy a per|petual Exemption from many Tributes and Taxations, with which the re&s;t of <HI>France</HI> are mi&s;erably afflicted. Among&s;t others, from that of Salt, by rea&s;on whereof, and the goodne&s;s of their Pa&s;tures they make the be&s;t Butter in all the Kingdom, and a Firkin of it is a very acceptable Pre&s;ent at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Bullorgn</HI> is divided into the <HI>Upper</HI> and <HI>lower,</HI> di&s;tant from one another a|bour a hundred Paces. The lower Town is
<PB N="70" REF="40">bigger than the Upper, which is called the City, better built, the Streets larger, and the People richer, mo&s;t of the Merchants inha|biting here for the conveniency of the Ha|ven. The Upper Town is environ'd with deep Ditches, a &s;trong Wall, a treble Gate, and two Draw-Bridges; a little Town it is, not above a flights &s;hot over in the wide&s;t Place, and has but one Church in it be&s;ides <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> which is the Cathedral. The Streets not many, and tho&s;e narrow, except in the Market-place, where the <HI>Corps du Gard</HI> is kept. What the Out-works are, or whe|ther it hath any, I cannot tell, for though it be a time of Peace, and they very fond of it, their Jealou&s;ie would not permit me to walk upon the Wall, either within or without the Town, and I wi&s;h that we were not inferior to our Neighbours in the greatne&s;s of their Care, &s;ince we are equal to the be&s;t of them in the goodne&s;s of our Country.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Mr. <HI>N.</HI> took Shipping for <HI>England</HI> with a fair Wind, I wi&s;h him a good Voyage, and the&s;e Papers &s;afe in your Hands, with a&s;&s;urance that while I continue in <HI>France,</HI> you &s;hall have a further Account of what occurs here, to</P>
