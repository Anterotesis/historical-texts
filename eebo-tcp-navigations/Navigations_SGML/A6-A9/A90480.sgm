<P>_THe Officers of the Army having had a General Meeting at <HI>James's We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> about the emer|gent and weighty Affairs of the Nation; in con|&s;ideration thereof, agreed upon a Letter to be &s;ent to the Officers of the &s;everal Gari&s;ons and Regiments of &s;ouldiers both in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire|land;</HI> a breviate whereof take as followeth; <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P>That after &s;everal dayes waiting at the Throne of grace, we were generally convinced, That our hearts have been looking after the things of this world, and our own privat affairs, more then the things of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his peo|ple. That we have been overtaken with a &s;lothful &s;pirit, &amp; growing weary of the work of the Lord, have been ready to &s;ay with <HI>Baruch, Wo is me now, for the Lord hath added grief to my &s;orrow, I fainted in my &s;ighing, and find no re&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Jer. 45.3.

Upon the&s;e and the like con&s;iderations
<PB N="4" REF="3"> we have been &s;trongly convinced, that it is a duty very much incumbent upon us to awaken our &s;elves, and by all lawful wayes and meanes to endeavor the procuring of the&s;e following things, which have been promi&s;ed by the Parliament, and, as we are informed, are under their pre|&s;ent con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, For the preventing the many inconveniencies ap|parently ari&s;ing from the long continuance of the &s;ame per&s;ons in &s;upreme Authority, That there may be &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Parliaments con&s;i&s;ting of men faithful to the intere&s;t of this Common-wealth; Men of Truth, fearing God, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Laws may be regulated in &s;uch &s;ort, that what is good in them may be maintain'd, and the cor|ruptions, abu&s;es, delayes, vexations, unnece&s;&s;ary Travels and expences, and what&s;oever &s;hall be found really bur|then&s;ome and grievous to the people, may be taken a|way</P>

<P>We hear that Cap. <HI>Cox,</HI> with 7 &s;ail of Engli&s;h, hath had a &s;harp conflict with 11 &s;ail of Dutch; but after four hours di&s;pute obtained a glorious Victory, &s;unk one, and took Three.</P>
