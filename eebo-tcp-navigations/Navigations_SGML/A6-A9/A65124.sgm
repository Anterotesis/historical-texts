<P>_THough I know it a high Pre&s;umption in me to affix &s;o great a <HI>Name</HI> to the&s;e <HI>Papers,</HI> yet I likewi&s;e very well know how hainous and apparent a <HI>Premunire</HI> I &s;hould incurr again&s;t all <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and in more par|ticular manner again&s;t my <HI>bounden Duty</HI> to your Lord&s;hip, to Entitle any other to their Protection, or to &s;et up any <HI>Foreign Power</HI> to be Supream and Paramount to that of your <HI>Excellency's</HI> over them: You my Lord be|ing at this time &s;eated in the great and honourable Stati|on
<PB REF="4"> of <HI>Governour General</HI> under his mo&s;t <HI>Sacred Maje&s;ty,</HI> of that Place which the &s;ubject Matter of the&s;e <HI>Papers</HI> par|ticularly relate to.</P>
<P>My Lord, Tho&s;e many Gracious and Regal Grants and Priviledges which his mo&s;t <HI>Excellent Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Royal An|ce&s;tors (of ever ble&s;&s;ed Memory)</HI> have from time to time be|&s;towed upon this his Maje&s;ties <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> &s;ince the fir&s;t Settlement of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, have given being to the&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> for the better Government thereof; it being impo&s;&s;ible for any number of Men to be at Peace or to flouri&s;h and pro&s;per without good <HI>Laws,</HI> which are the firm Pillars of Government, and the &s;trong Bonds of all Humane Society. One had as good live in a De&s;art among&s;t Savage Bea&s;ts, as among Men without <HI>Law</HI> to defend him; for <HI>Laws</HI> are the Hedges on either &s;ide the Road, which hinders from breaking into other Mens Propriety.</P>
<P><HI>Laws</HI> are every Mans Civil Armour, that Guards him from the Gripes of Rapine and all other Outragious A&s;&s;aults and In&s;olencies, and indeed 'tis for this chiefly that <HI>Laws</HI> are of u&s;e among&s;t us, not only to be our Guide, but al&s;o our Shield.</P>
<P>The Great and Univer&s;al Monarch of the World, the Supream Being, at fir&s;t, in the very Infancy of Time gave unto Man a Law upon <HI>Parole,</HI> in&s;cribed in his heart, that by tho&s;e inward Dictates he might be guided and bound|ed in the whole Cour&s;e and Road of his Life; but &s;uch has the Pravity of Humane Nature been, that this Divine In&s;cription is in a great mea&s;ure defaced; &s;o that Kings and Princes have found it of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to give Lite|ral and Pre&s;cripted <HI>Laws</HI> for the Government and Well-being of Mankind in their re&s;pective Places and So|cieties.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>The&s;e Papers being a Collection of the <HI>Laws</HI> of this Place, pre&s;ume not to In&s;truct your <HI>Excellency,</HI> who in the fair Volume of your great Mind have all the <HI>Laws</HI> of E|quity and Ju&s;tice engraven, and the va&s;t Univer&s;al <HI>Idea</HI> of whatever can be call'd good in Mankind is there &s;tamp'd. But my Lord, the&s;e Papers which contain <HI>Laws,</HI> and there|fore ought to pre&s;erve others from Calumny and Cen&s;ures, yet cannot them&s;elves; humbly crave your Excellencies Patronage, which proves a Sanctuary to all Goodne&s;s, &s;o well as your Power is a Terror to all Vice.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Collection of <HI>Laws</HI> is the Good of the Inhabitants of this Place, for <HI>Laws</HI> though Enacted, &s;tand in little &s;tead and u&s;e till they are promulgated and made known to all per&s;ons concerned in the Obedience of them: Not my Lord that I accu&s;e all the Inhabitants here with ig|norance of their Duty, but, may it plea&s;e your Excellency, The knowledg of all things that are good, the more diffu|&s;ive the better, and I hope my Lord, that my hone&s;t and good intent herein will le&s;&s;en and expiate in &s;ome mea&s;ure my pre&s;umption in this Dedication to your Ex|cellency.</P>
<P>Your Illu&s;trious Fore-fathers have been always famous for their con&s;tant and exemplary Loyalty to their <HI>Prince,</HI> and &s;ome of them have received the Signal Marks of Roy|al Bounty. Your Excellency has eminently and de&s;erved|ly partaken of both, for his mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty (whom God grant long to Reign) &s;eeing you treading in the &s;ame Steps of Loyalty with your Vertuous and Noble Ance&s;tors, hath in his Princely Wi&s;dom been plea&s;ed to entru&s;t your Lord&s;hip with the Weighty and Honoura|ble Employment of <HI>Lieutenant</HI> and <HI>Governour General</HI> of <HI>VIRGINIA.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>How happy is his Maje&s;ty in &s;o Wi&s;e and Faithful a Subject and Mini&s;ter! And how happy is your Excellency in &s;erving a King who&s;e Wi&s;dom cannot only di&s;cern and ju&s;tly value, but who&s;e Goodne&s;s and Power can al&s;o Re|compence the Merits of a Subject never &s;o great!</P>
<P>But my Lord, I dare not extend my &s;elf upon your Excellencies Panegyrick, which is an infinite Subject, and requires the Pen of the mo&s;t Skilful Orator: I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf to admire with other Men what I cannot comprehend, le&s;t I &s;hould offend and be injurious to your Excellency by my little and weak Expre&s;&s;ions, which are far below my thoughts, and my thoughts far below your great and high Merits; which nece&s;&s;a|rily forces all Men (who&s;e happine&s;s 'tis to know your Lord&s;hip) to a&s;pire, and I more than all others, to take the liberty to write and &s;tile my &s;elf</P>

<HEAD>A Complete Collection OF THE LAVVS OF VIRGINIA AT A Grand A&s;&s;embly HELD AT JAMES CITY 23 <HI>MARCH</HI> 1662.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEREAS the late unhappy Di|&s;tractions cau&s;ed frequent Change in the Government of this Coun|trey, and tho&s;e produced &s;o ma|ny Alterations in the Laws, that the people knew not well what to obey, nor the Judges what to puni&s;h: By which means Inju|&s;tice was hardly to be avoided, and the Ju&s;t Freedom of the Peo|ple, by the uncertainty and li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of the Laws, hardly to be pre&s;erved. This
<PB N="2" REF="6"> A&s;&s;embly taking the &s;ame into their &s;erious Con&s;iderati|ons, and gravely weighing the Obligations they are to di&s;charge to God, the King, and the Countrey, have by &s;ettling the Laws, diligently endeavoured to prevent the like Inconveniencies, by cau&s;ing the whole Body of the Laws to be revived, all unnece&s;&s;ary Acts, and chiefly &s;uch as might keep in memory our forced deviation from His Maje&s;ties Obedience, to be repealed and expunged; and tho&s;e that are in force to be brought into one Volume: And le&s;t any prejudice might ari&s;e by the ignorance of the Times from whence tho&s;e Acts were in force, they have added the Dates of every Act, to the end that Courts might rightly admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice and give Sen|tence according to Law for any thing happening at any time &s;ince any Law was in force: And have al&s;o endea|voured in all things as near as the Capacity and Con|&s;titution of this Countrey would admit, to adhere to tho&s;e excellent and often refined Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to which we profe&s;s and acknowledge all Reverence and Obedi|ence. And that the Laws made by us are intended by us but as Brief Memorials of that which the Capacity of our Courts is utterly unable to collect out of its va&s;t Volumes, though &s;ometimes perhaps, for the difference of our and their Condition, varying in &s;mall things, but far from the pre&s;umption of contradicting any thing therein contained. And becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to honour the King as we &s;hould, unle&s;s we &s;erve and fear God as we ought. And that they might &s;hew their equal care, they have &s;et down certain Rules to be ob&s;erved in the Government of the Church, until God &s;hall plea&s;e to turn His Maje&s;ties Pious Thoughts towards us, and provide a better &s;upply of Mini&s;ters among us.</P>
