<P>_SEe here a piece of Babari&s;m, which hath lain &s;o long both as an in|jurie, and a dishonour to our Nation brought again to light, by which, as we may compare the difference of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed times, from tho&s;e unhappie ones when this was acted and pa&s;&s;ed by; &s;o we mu&s;t needs remember to ble&s;s God

<P>_IF we con&s;ider how loud and pre&s;&s;ing the crie of bloud is, or with what high &s;everity God ever proceeds again&s;t it, though his wrath for &s;ome &s;mall time may &s;eem to be a&s;leep, we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear, that there is a heavy account mu&s;t be given by the <HI>Dutch</HI> for that execra|ble Tyrannie of theirs exe|cuted
<PB REF="5">upon the bodies of &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Amboyna.</HI> To take away any mans life without due cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, though it be with the greate&s;t civility and ea|&s;ine&s;s of death that could be, is a crime which God hath denounced murder, and will vi&s;it accordingly; but to heighten and multiply a death with all the previous Tortures that a pa&s;&s;ionate Diabolical malice can in|vent, cruelty inflict, or the frame of mans body under|go, is &s;o far from being manly or Chri&s;tian, that it is beyond &s;avagene&s;s and be&s;tiality, and approches that accur&s;ed frame of &s;pi|rit that he hath plundged him&s;elf into, who &s;its in the &s;eat of darkne&s;s.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>For my part as I delight not to be curious in the&s;e &s;peculations, which acquaint the mind with extremities and Critici&s;ms of &s;in, &s;o it is a grief that the Theory of wickedne&s;s &s;hould be &s;o much enlarged as it would be by the treati&s;e which thou ha&s;t in thy hands; Which, as it hath bruiti&s;hly out-done all former records and examples of cruelty, &s;o it may unluckily po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve for in&s;truction to &s;ome future inventive and poi&s;oned &s;pirits. And in|deed as I wi&s;h the occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing of it had ne|ver been, &s;o do I wi&s;h ju|&s;tice once required and had, that the remembrance of it might have been buried. But the breach being &s;o na|tional,
<PB REF="6">and to this day un|&s;atisfied, and the bloud there &s;pilt no doubt crying loud, it had been inju&s;tice in us to have buried it in &s;i|lence, and not di&s;played it to the &s;un. For as the be|ginning of tho&s;e Torments were from a cau&s;ele&s;s and and &s;light &s;u&s;pition of an improbable and ineffective plot, &s;o by that means were we forced from our po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in tho&s;e parts, and the injury became complicated, both as again&s;t ju&s;tice and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>True it is that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company made the mo&s;t diligent addre&s;&s;es to King <HI>James</HI> for revenge that could be, but that bla|zing Star of Fortune, that was after removed by a
<PB REF="6">&s;tab, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a great &s;um of money, interpo&s;ed between the judgement of that King, and over-ruled his affection, &s;o that he, who was naturally un-active and drou&s;ie enough, being lull'd by &s;uch a <HI>privado,</HI> fel a&s;leep, and &s;norted out the re&s;t of his idle reign in debauchery and &s;ilence. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company &s;eing them&s;elves ob&s;tructed in the pro&s;ecu|tion, thought fit to pre&s;erve the memorie of &s;uch a but|chery, by getting the &s;eve|ral Tortures done at large in Oyl, but the Table was &s;carce &s;ooner hung up, but the Murderers began to fear it would bleed at the no&s;e; &s;o that <HI>Buckingham</HI> was appea&s;ed by another &s;acrifice, and the Picture
<PB REF="7">commanded to be taken down.</P>
<P>In King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time the bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;tirred in, he had too great de&s;igns at home, than to pre&s;erve our Honour, or remedy our injuries abroad; but now &s;ince that yoak of King&s;hip is taken off our necks, me thinks we &s;hould like men, who&s;e &s;hackles are taken off them while they are a&s;leep, leap up nimbly, and make u&s;e of our Liberty. It were the mo&s;t irrational thing in the World to think of for|giving of them, who, though they received a&s;&s;i&s;tance from us in their greate&s;t af|fliction and lowe&s;t mi&s;erie, have refu&s;ed not onely to a&s;&s;i&s;t us now, when their ca&s;e is ours, but have been
<PB REF="7">more than neutral again&s;t us, jealous, it &s;hould &s;eem, that their way of Govern|ment, which they have &s;o grown and thriven under, &s;hould have the &s;ame effects with us. But I hope God will give us hearts to make u&s;e of the advantages in our hands, and per&s;i&s;t in doing wonderfull things for us. And as he hath brought us out of the de&s;art in &s;o high and fearfull a manner, &s;o no doubt if we walk an&s;werably, we &s;hall &s;ee his countenance &s;hine upon us, and improve this ble&s;&s;ed peace at home, to make good our peace abroad, and &s;o by his good a&s;&s;i&s;tance en|joy &s;uch earthly ble&s;&s;ings, as may render us &s;afe, if not terrible to the Nations round about us.</P>

<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>GEntle Reader, thou maye&s;t (perhaps) won|der why this Relation of the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> &s;o many Moneths &s;ince taken upon the Oaths and depo&s;iti|ons of our people that came thence, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and the Lords of his Privy Councel, cometh now at la&s;t to the Pre&s;s, and was not either &s;ooner pu|bli&s;hed, or altogether &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. The truth is, the En|gli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company have ever been very tender of the ancient amity and
<PB REF="9">good corre&s;pondence held be|tween this Realm and the Neatherlands, and have been very loath, by divulging of the private injuries done them by the Neatherlands Ea&s;t-India Company, to give the least occa&s;ion of any di|&s;ta&s;t or disaffection, which might happily grow between the&s;e two Nations, for the &s;ake, and on the behalf of the two Companies re&s;pectively. For which cau&s;e, although the wrongs and injuries, or rather contumelies done unto the Engli&s;h by the Dutch in the Indies, have been as in|tolerable as manifold; as to &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e great heaps of them buried in the <HI>Amne&s;ty</HI> of the Treaty of the year <HI>1619.</HI> and onely to point at the general heads of tho&s;e
<PB REF="9">committed &s;ince that Treaty, and gro&s;&s;ely contrarie to the main intent, and expre&s;s words and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ame: first, in the point of ho&s;tility; the inva&s;ion of the I&s;lands of <HI>Lantore</HI> and <HI>Po|laroone,</HI> then and before in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the Engli&s;h, in the name of the Crown of England; the ta|king of the &s;ame I&s;lands by force; the razing and demo|li&s;hing of the Engli&s;h Forts; the binding of the Engli&s;h (that had not &s;o much as re|&s;i&s;ted them) to &s;takes with ropes about their necks, throt|tling them with the &s;ame, and flouri&s;hing their naked &s;words about them, as if they would pre&s;ently have di|&s;patched them; then taking them &s;o amazed and bound,
<PB REF="10">and tumbling them down the rocks; and after, carrying their cru&s;hed and brui&s;ed car|ca&s;ses away in irons: &s;econd|ly, in the point of their u&s;urp|ed &s;overeignty; their taking upon them the Conu&s;ance of controver&s;ies between the En|gli&s;h and the Indians, for matters pa&s;&s;ed far without the compa&s;s of the Neather|lands pretended juri&s;diction, and executing their &s;entences thereupon by plain force; &s;eizing of the Engli&s;h Com|panies goods, fining, impri|&s;oning, &s;tocking, yea, whip|ping our people at a post in the open market-place, and after, wa&s;hing them with vinegar and &s;alt: thirdly, in point of partner&s;hip with the Engli&s;h, their putting great &s;ums to the common account;
<PB REF="10">which were disbur&s;ed to the private and &s;ole behoof of the Dutch; giving great pre|&s;ents for the glory of the Dutch, without con&s;ent of the Engli&s;h, and making war for the inlargement of their own dominion, yet bringing the charge to the common ac|count; together with infinite other the like, the particulars whereof would ari&s;e to a ju&s;t and ample volume: Never|thele&s;s, the Engli&s;h Company from time to time contented them&s;elves with informing his Maje&s;tie, and his Honou|rable Privy Councel with their grievances privately in writing, to the end, that ne|ce&s;&s;ary relief and reparation might be obtained, without publi&s;hing any thing to the World in print, thereby to
<PB REF="11">&s;tir up or breed ill bloud be|tween the&s;e Nations, which are otherwi&s;e tied in &s;o ma|ny reciprocal obligations. And the &s;ame cour&s;e they have hitherto holden al&s;o in this crying bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> onely offering to the <HI>Manes</HI> of their mur|dered Countrey-men, Factors and Kinsfolks, their effe|ctual endeavours in a duti|full cour&s;e unto his Maje&s;ty for ju&s;tice for their innocent bloud, and reparation of the honour of the Nation herein intere&s;&s;ed. In which their wonted way they were &s;o con|&s;tant, that they could not be driven out of the &s;ame by the contrary cour&s;e of &s;ome of the other party; that not glutted nor mollified with the bloud of the&s;e innocents, nor
<PB REF="11">with all the other &s;ufferings of the Engli&s;h in the Indies, publi&s;hed a Pamphlet in print in the Neatherlands Lan|guage, not onely in justi|fication of this barbarous butchery, but withall in di&s;|grace of the Engli&s;h Nation, and the Laws and ju&s;tice of the &s;ame. But behold now further, the &s;ame Pamphlet, being called in by an Edict of the States General, was yet afterwards tran&s;lated and printed in Engli&s;h, and di|&s;per&s;ed even in this Realm it &s;elf, to brave and di&s;|grace us at our own dores, and in our own language. This, no Engli&s;h patience can bear: the bloud of the inno|cent cries out again&s;t it: the honour of the Nation &s;uffer|eth in it. Wherefore the
<PB REF="12">Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Compa|ny is hereby inforced, con|trary to their de&s;ire and cu|&s;tom, to have recour&s;e al&s;o to the Pre&s;s, to maintain the reputation of tho&s;e their Countrey-men and &s;ervants, that lo&s;t their lives unjustly; and to acquaint the World with the naked truth of this cau&s;e, hitherto masked, muf|fled, and ob&s;cured in a fog of factions, concealments, and crafty conveyances of the Author of this Pamphlet, and his clients, the Governour and Councel (&s;o termed) of <HI>Amboyna.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus acquainted thee, gentle Reader, with the rea&s;ons why this bu&s;ine&s;s was no &s;ooner publi&s;hed in print, it remaineth yet further, that thou be &s;atisfied in an ob|jection
<PB REF="12">or two more, which common rea&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t unto thee. Without doubt, reading this di&s;cour&s;e, and being a true Patriot of thine own Countrey, and a well-willer of the Neatherlands (as we pre&s;ume and wi&s;h thee to be,) thou wilt wonder how it cometh to pa&s;s, that our Nation, which hath not been wont to receive &s;uch disgra|ces, &s;hould now be &s;o weak and unprovided in the In|dies, as to &s;uffer &s;uch in|dignities, and to be &s;o gro&s;ly overtopped, outraged and vilified there? as al&s;o thou wilt no le&s;s admire, that any of the Netherlands Nation, which hath received &s;uch and &s;o many favours and &s;upports from hence, and held &s;o good and antient corre|&s;pondence
<PB REF="13">with our Nation, &s;hould now offer and commit &s;uch odious contumelies on Engli&s;h men, their partners, and allies by &s;pecial Treaty. Herein thou wilt &s;oon an&s;wer thy &s;elf, if thou but con&s;ider the different end and de&s;ign of the Engli&s;h and Dutch Companies trading in the In|dies, appearing by their &s;e|veral cour&s;e and practi&s;e re|&s;pectively. The Engli&s;h be|ing &s;ubjects of a peaceable Prince, that hath enough of his own, and is therewith content, without affecting of new acque&s;ts; have aimed at nothing in their Ea&s;t-In|dia Trade, but a Lawfull and competent gain by com|merce and Traffick with the people of tho&s;e parts. And although they have in &s;ome
<PB REF="13">places builded Forts, and &s;etled &s;ome &s;trength, yet that hath not been done by force or violence, again&s;t the good will of the Magi&s;trates or people of the Countrey; but with their de&s;ire, con&s;ent, and good liking, for the &s;e|curity onely of the Trade, and upon the &s;aid Magi&s;trate and peoples voluntary yielding them&s;elves under the obe|dience and Sovereignty of the Crown of England; their own ancient Laws, Cu&s;toms and Priviledges, neverthe|le&s;s re&s;erved. Further, the &s;ame Engli&s;h had undoubted confidence in the Neather|lands Nation there al&s;o trading, e&s;pecially being late|ly conjoyned with them in the &s;trict alliance and &s;ocial confederacy of the year <HI>1619.</HI>
<PB REF="14">and therefore attended no|thing from them, but the offices of good affection and partner&s;hip. Upon the&s;e grounds, the Engli&s;h Com|pany made their equipages an&s;werable onely to a cour&s;e of commerce and peaceable traffick; not expecting any ho&s;tility, neither from the Indians, nor e&s;pecially from the Dutch. On the other &s;ide, the Neatherlanders, from the beginning of their trade in the Indies, not contented with the ordinary cour&s;e of a fair and free commerce, in|vaded divers I&s;lands, took &s;ome Forts, built others, and laboured nothing more, than the conque&s;ts of Countries, and the acquiring of new do|minion. By which rea&s;on, as they were accordingly pro|vided
<PB REF="14">of &s;hipping, &s;ouldiers, and all warlike provi&s;ion, as al&s;o of places of Rendevouz upon the &s;hore, and thereby enabled to wrong the Engli&s;h as well as others: &s;o the co&s;t and charges of their &s;hipping, Forts, and Souldiers, im|ploied upon the&s;e de&s;igns, ro&s;e to &s;uch an height, as was not to be maintained by the trade they had in tho&s;e parts. Wherefore, for a &s;upply, they were forced (as &s;ome of their own Countrey-men and Ad|venturers in their Company, affirm) to fi&s;h with dry nets, that is to &s;ay, to pick quar|rels with the Indians, and &s;o to take their &s;hips, and make prize of their goods. Which yet not an&s;wering their charge and adventure, they proceeded al&s;o to quarrel with
<PB REF="15">the Engli&s;h, to debar them of trade to free places; and for attempting &s;uch trade, to take their &s;hips and goods. Touching which, when a good order was &s;et by the &s;aid trea|ty of the year <HI>1619.</HI> yet they &s;aw, they could not make their reckoning to any pur|po&s;e, unle&s;s they utterly drave the Engli&s;h out of the trade of tho&s;e parts; thereby to have the whole and &s;ole traffick of the commodities of the Indies in the&s;e parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in their own hands; and &s;o to make the price at their plea&s;ure, &s;uf|ficient to maintain and pro|mote their conque&s;ts, and withall to yield them an ample benefit of their trade|ing. Which unle&s;s they can, by this and the like worry|ing
<PB REF="15">and wearying of the Engli&s;h bring to pa&s;s, it is ea&s;ie to be judged by tho&s;e that understand any thing of the cour&s;e and &s;tate of the trade of tho&s;e parts, that albeit their returns hereafter &s;hould prove as great con|tinually, as of late extraor|dinarily they have happened to be, yet the main &s;tock and E&s;tate of the Company must needs abate and decay by &s;ome hundred thou&s;ands of pounds yearly. Thus, Rea|der, thou &s;ee&s;t what hath made us unprovided against &s;uch accidents, and what now enforceth the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, or their &s;ervants in the Indies, again&s;t the common Genius of their Nation, and the wonted firm affection between the&s;e two
<PB REF="16">Nations mutually, thus to degenerate, and break out into &s;uch &s;trange and incre|dible outrages again&s;t their nearest allies and be&s;t de&s;er|ving friends. <HI>Farewell.</HI></P>

Wherefore in con&s;equence of this agreement, the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Compa|ny planted certain Factories for their &s;hare of this Trade; &s;ome at the <HI>Molluccos,</HI> &s;ome at <HI>Banda,</HI> and &s;ome at <HI>Amboyna.</HI> Of the two former of the&s;e, there will be, at this pre&s;ent &s;mall occa&s;ion to &s;peak further; but the la&s;t will prove the Scene of a &s;ad Tragedy.</P>

<P>Upon the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and the point of <HI>Seran,</HI> the Hol|landers have four Forts, the chief of all is at the &s;aid Town of <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> and is very &s;trong, having four Points or Bulwarks with their Curtains, and upon each of the&s;e Points &s;ix great pieces of Ordinance mounted, mo&s;t of them of bra&s;s.

<P>Then was <HI>Edward Collins</HI> cal|led in,

<PB N="13" REF="22">when he denied with great Oaths and execrations, they made his hands and feet fa&s;t to the Rack, bound a cloath about his throat, ready to be put to the torture of water. Thus prepared, he prayed to be re&s;pited, and he would con|fe&s;s all. Being let down, he a|gain vowed and prote&s;ted his in|nocencie; yet &s;aid, that becau&s;e he knew that they would by tor|ture make him confe&s;s any thing, though never &s;o fal&s;e, they &s;hould do him a great favour, to tell him what they would have him &s;ay, and he would &s;peak it, to avoid the torture. The Fi&s;cal hereupon &s;aid; What, do you mock us? and bad, Up with him again; and &s;o gave him the torment of wa|ter: which he not able long to endure, prayed to be let down again to his Confe&s;&s;ion. Then he devi&s;ed a little with him&s;elf, and told them, That about two moneths and a half before, him|&s;elf, <HI>Tom&s;on, John&s;on, Brown,</HI> and <HI>Fardo,</HI> had plotted, with the help of the <HI>Japoners,</HI> to &s;urpri&s;e the Ca&s;tle. Here he was interrupted by the Fi&s;cal, and asked whether
<PB N="14" REF="23">Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> were not of that con&s;piracie. He an&s;wered, No. You lie, &s;aid the Fi&s;cal; did not he call you all to him, and tell you, that tho&s;e daily abu&s;es of the <HI>Dutch</HI> had cau&s;ed him to think of a Plot, and that he wanted nothing but your con&s;ent and &s;ecrecie? Then &s;aid a Dutch Merchant, one <HI>John Joo&s;t</HI> that &s;tood by. Did not you all &s;wear upon a Bible to be &s;e|cret to him? <HI>Collins</HI> an&s;wered with great Oaths, that he knew nothing of any &s;uch matter. Then they bad make him fa&s;t again: whereupon he then &s;aid, All was true that they had &s;po|ken. Then the Fi&s;cal asked him, whether the Engli&s;h in the re&s;t of the Factories, were not con|&s;enting to this Plot. He an|&s;wered, No. The Fi&s;cal then asked him, whether the Pre&s;i|dent of the Engli&s;h at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> or Ma&s;ter <HI>Welden</HI> A gent in <HI>Ban|da,</HI> were not Plotters or privy to this bu&s;ine&s;s.

Whereat, when <HI>Collins</HI> &s;tood &s;taggering and devi&s;ing of &s;ome probable fiction, the Fi&s;cal holp him, and &s;aid, Should not two <HI>Japoners</HI> have gone to each point of the Ca&s;tle, and two to the Governours Chamber door; and when the hurly-burly had been without, and the Gover|nour coming to &s;ee what was the matter, the <HI>Japoners</HI> to have killed him? Here one that &s;tood by, &s;aid to the Fi&s;cal, Do not tell him what he &s;hould &s;ay, but let him &s;peak of him&s;elf. Whereupon the Fi&s;cal, without attending the an&s;wer to his for|mer que&s;tion, asked what the <HI>Japoners</HI> &s;hould have had for their reward. <HI>Collins</HI> an&s;wered, 1000 Ryals apiece. La&s;tly, he asked him, when this plot &s;hould have been effected. Whereun|to, although he an&s;wered him nothing (not knowing what to devi&s;e upon the &s;udden) yet he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and very glad to come clear of the Torture, though with certain belief that he &s;hould die for this his confe&s;|&s;ion.</P>

<P>Next was <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> brought in,

<P>Then was <HI>John Clark,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Clark <HI>examined.</HI></NOTE> that came with <HI>Col&s;on</HI> from <HI>Hitto,</HI> fetcht in, and a little after was heard (by the re&s;t that were with|out in the Hall) to crie out amain, They Tortured him with water and with fire, by the &s;pace of two hours. The manner of his Torture (as al&s;o of <HI>John&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;ons</HI>) was as followeth: Fir&s;t they hoi|&s;ed him up by the hands with a cord on a large dore, where they made him fa&s;t upon two &s;taples of Iron, fixt on both &s;ides at the top of the dore po&s;ts, haling his hands one from the other as wide as they could &s;tretch. Being thus
<PB N="17" REF="24">made fa&s;t, his feet hung &s;ome two foot from the ground; which al|&s;o they &s;tretcht a&s;under as far as they would retch, and &s;o made them fa&s;t beneath unto the dore|trees on each &s;ide. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face &s;o clo&s;e, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water &s;oftly up|on his head untill the cloath was full up to the mouth and no&s;trils, and &s;omewhat higher; &s;o that he could not draw breath, but he mu&s;t withall &s;uck in the water: which being &s;till continued to be poured in &s;oftly, forced all his inward parts, came out of his no&s;e, ears, and eyes, and often, as it were &s;tifling and choaking him, at length took away his breath, &amp; brought him to a &s;woun or faint|ing. Then they took him quickly down, &amp; made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they triced him up again, &amp; pour|ed in the water as before, eft&s;oons taking him down as he &s;eemed to be &s;tifled. In this manner they handled him three or four &s;eve|ral times with water, till his bo|dy
<PB N="18" REF="25">was &s;woln twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes &s;taring and &s;trutting out beyond his fore|head: yet all this he bare, with|out confe&s;&s;ing any thing; in&s;o|much as the Fi&s;cal and tormen|tors reviled him, &s;aying, that he was a Divel, and no man, or &s;urely was a Witch, at lea&s;t had &s;ome charm about him, or was enchanted, that he could bear &s;o much. Wherefore they cut off his hair very &s;hort, as &s;uppo&s;ing he had &s;ome witchcraft hidden therein. Afterwards they hoi&s;ed him up again as before, and then burnt him with lighted candles in the bottom of his feet, untill the fat dropt out the candles; yet then applied they fre&s;h lights un|to him. They burnt him al&s;o un|der the elbows, and in the palms of the hands; likewi&s;e under the arm-pits, untill his inwards might evidently be &s;een. At la&s;t, when they &s;aw he could of him&s;elf make no hand&s;ome confe&s;&s;ion, then they led him along with que&s;tions of particular circum|&s;tances, by them&s;elves framed.
<PB N="19" REF="25">Being thus wearied and over|come by the torment, he an|&s;wered, yea, to what&s;oever they asked: whereby they drew from him a body of a confe&s;&s;ion to this effect; to wit, That Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> had upon New-years day la&s;t before, &s;worn all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Amboyna</HI> to be &s;ecret and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to a plot that he had projected, with the help of the <HI>Japoners,</HI> to &s;urpri&s;e the Ca&s;tle, and to put the Governour and the re&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to death.</P>
<P>Having thus martyred this poor man, they &s;ent him out by four Blacks: who carried him between them to a dungeon, where he lay five or &s;ix dayes, without any Chirurgion to dre&s;s him, untill (his fle&s;h being putri|fied) great Maggots dropt and crept fro~ him in a mo&s;t loath&s;om and noi&s;om manner.

Then went the Fi&s;cal out into another room to the Governour, and anon re|turned, and &s;ent <HI>Sharrock</HI> unto the Pri&s;on again.

He an&s;wered, No, Why then, &s;aid the Fi&s;cal, did you confe&s;s it? He an&s;wered, For fear of Torment. The Fi&s;cal and the re&s;t in a great rage told him he lied; his mouth had &s;poken it, and it was true, and therefore he &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe it. Which as &s;oon as he had done, he fell pre|&s;ently into a great pa&s;&s;ion charging them bitterly to be guiltie of the innocent bloud of him&s;elf and the re&s;t, which they &s;hould look to an&s;wer for at the day of Judge|ment: withall he grappled with the Fi&s;cal, and would have &s;top|ped him from carrying in the confe&s;&s;ion to the Governour, with whom he al&s;o craved to &s;peak; but was in&s;tantly laid hold on, and carried away to pri&s;on.</P>

<P>The &s;ix and twentieth of Fe|bruary, <HI>Stilo veteri,</HI> the Pri&s;oners were all brought into the great Hall of the Ca&s;tle (except Cap|tain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> &amp; <HI>Emanuel Tom|&s;on</HI>) to be prepared for death by the mini&s;ters. The <HI>Iaponeers</HI> now all in general, as &s;ome of them had done before in particular, cryed out unto the Engli&s;h, &s;aying; Oh you Engli&s;h men, where did we ever in our lives eat with you, talk with you, or (to our remem|brance) &s;ee you? The Engli&s;h an|&s;wered, Why then have you ac|cu&s;ed us? The poor men, percei|ving they were made believe each had accu&s;ed others, before they had &s;o done indeed; &s;hewed them their tortur'd bodies, and &s;aid, If a &s;tone were thus burnt, would it not change his nature? how much more we that are fle&s;h and bloud?</P>
<P>Whil'&s;t they were all in the Hall, Cap. <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> was brought up into the place of examination and two great Jarres of water carried
<PB N="39" REF="35">after him. What he there did or &s;uffered was unknown to the Engli&s;h without: but it &s;eemeth they made him then to under|write his confe&s;&s;ion. After &s;upper <HI>John Powl, Ephraim Ram&s;ey, Th. Ladbrook,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Sadler,</HI> who were found not guily, as afore|&s;aid, were taken from the re&s;t, and put into another room. By and by al&s;o were <HI>Samuel Col&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Edward Collins</HI> brought from the re&s;t; into the room where <HI>Ema|nuel Tom&s;on</HI> lay: The Fi&s;cal told them, it was the Governours mercie, to &s;ave one of them three: and it being indifferent to him, which of them were the man, it was his plea&s;ure they &s;hould draw lots for it, which they did, and the free lot fell to <HI>Edward Col|lins;</HI> who then was carried away to the Chamber, where <HI>John Powl</HI> and the re&s;t that were quit, lodged, and <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> back into the Hall. Anon al&s;o <HI>John Beomont</HI> was brought out of the Hall into the Chamber, where <HI>John Powl,</HI> and the re&s;t of the acquitted per&s;ons were, and was told, that he was beholding to
<PB N="40" REF="36"><HI>Peter Iohn&s;on</HI> the Dutch Mer|chant of <HI>Lobo,</HI> and to the Secre|tarie; for they two had begged his life.</P>
<P>So then there remained in the Hall ten of the Engli&s;h; for Cap|tain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> &amp; <HI>Emmanuel Tom|&s;on</HI> (as is &s;aid before) were kept in &s;everal rooms apart from the re&s;t. To the&s;e that remained in the Hall, came the Dutch Mini|&s;ters, who telling them how &s;hort a time they had to live, admo|ni&s;hed and exhorted them to make their true confe&s;&s;ions; for it was a dangerous and de&s;perate thing, to di&s;&s;emble at &s;uch a time. The Engli&s;h &s;till profe&s;&s;ed their innocencie, and prayed the Mi|ni&s;ters that they might all re|ceive the Sacraments, as a &s;eal of the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins; and withall, thereby to confirm their la&s;t profe&s;&s;ion of their in|nocencie. But this would by no means be granted. Whereupon <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> &s;aid thus unto the Mini&s;ters; You manife&s;t unto us the danger of di&s;&s;imulation in this ca&s;e. But tell us, if we &s;uffer guiltle&s;s, being other wi&s;e al&s;o true
<PB N="41" REF="36">believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, What &s;hall be our reward? The Prea|cher an&s;wered, By how much the clearer you are, &s;o much the more glorious &s;hal be your re&s;urrection. With that word, <HI>Col&s;on</HI> &s;tarted up, imbraced the Preacher, &amp; gave him his pur&s;e,, with &s;uch money as he had in it, &s;aying; <HI>Domine,</HI> God ble&s;s you: tell the Gover|nour, I freely forgive him; and I intreat you, to exhort him to re|pent him of his bloudy tragedy, wrought upon us poor innocent &s;ouls. Here all the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;ignified their con&s;ent to this Speech. Then &s;pake <HI>John Fardo</HI> to the re&s;t, in pre&s;ence of the Mini&s;ters, as followeth: My Countrey-men, and Brethren, all that are here with me co~demned to die, I charge you all, as you will an&s;wer it at Gods judge|ment &s;eat, if any of you be guil|ty of this matter, whereof we are condemned, di&s;charge your con&s;ciences, and confe&s;s the truth for &s;atisfaction of the World. Hereupon <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> &s;pake with a loud voice, &s;aying, Ac|cording to my innocencie in this
<PB N="42" REF="37">trea&s;on, &s;o Lord pardon all the re&s;t of my &s;ins: and if I be guilty thereof more or le&s;s, let me ne|ver be partaker of thy heavenly joyes. At which words every one of the re&s;t cried out, Amen for me, Amen for me, good Lord. This done, each of them know|ing whom he had accu&s;ed, went one to another begging forgive|nes for their fal&s;e accu&s;ation, be|ing wrung from them by the pains or fear of torture. And they all freely forgave one another: for none had been &s;o fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, but he him&s;elf had accu&s;ed ano|ther as fal&s;ly. In particular, <HI>George Sharrock</HI> (who &s;urvived to relate this nights pa&s;&s;age) kneeled down to <HI>Iohn Clark,</HI> whom he had ac|cu&s;ed of the tale at <HI>Hitto</HI> above mentioned, and craved forgive|ne&s;s at his hands. <HI>Clark</HI> freely forgave him, &s;aying; how &s;hould I look to be forgiven of God, if I &s;hould not forgive you, having my &s;elf &s;o fal&s;ly accu&s;ed Captain <HI>Tower&s;on,</HI> and others?</P>
<P>After this, they &s;pent the re&s;t of the dolefull night in Prayer, &s;inging of P&s;alms, and comfort|ing

<P>Upon the morrow morning, being the execution day, the 27. of February, <HI>Stilo veteri, John Powl</HI> being freed (as is above re|cited) came into the room where the condemned per&s;ons were, and found them at Prayer.

<P>The &s;ame morning <HI>William Wehber</HI> was called again into the Fi&s;cals room, and there pre&s;|&s;ed to produce the letter, which he had before confe&s;&s;ed to have received from <HI>John Clark,</HI> in the <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI> whereof &s;ome great bu|&s;ine&s;s was intimated.

<P>That morning <HI>Emanuel Tom&s;on</HI> under&s;tanding that <HI>John Beomont</HI> was pardoned, made means to have him come and &s;peak with him; which, with much ado, he obtained. <HI>Beomont</HI> found him &s;itting in a Chamber, all alone in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable fa&s;hion; the wounds of his torture bound up, but the matter &amp; gore-bloud i&s;|&s;uing through the Rollers. He took M. <HI>Beomont</HI> by the hand, and prayed him, when he came into England, to do his duty to the Honourable Company, his Ma|&s;ters, to M. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> and to his brother <HI>Billing&s;ley,</HI> and to certi|fie them of his innocencie, which (&s;aid he) you your &s;elf know well enough.</P>
<P>All things being prepared for the execution, the condemned were brought forth of the Hall along by the Chamber where the quit and pardoned were; who
<PB N="45" REF="38">&s;tood in the dore, to give and take the farewell of their Coun|trey-men now going to execu|tion. Staying a little for this purpo&s;e, they prayed and charged tho&s;e, that were &s;aved, to bear witne&s;s to their friends in Eng|land of their innocencie, and that they died not Traitors, but &s;o many Innocents, meerly mur|thered by the Hollanders, whom they prayed God to forgive their bloud-thir&s;tine&s;s, and to have mercie upon their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Being brought into the Yard, their &s;entence was there read unto them from a Gallery, and then they were thence carried unto the place of execution, together with nine <HI>Japons</HI> and a Portu|gal: not the ordinarie and &s;hort way, but round about in a long proce&s;&s;ion, through the Town; the way guarded with five Compa|nies of Souldiers, Dutch, and Amboyners, and thronged with the Natives of the I&s;land, that (upon the &s;ummons given the day before by the &s;ound of the Drum) flocked together to be|hold this triumph of the Dutch
<PB N="46" REF="39">over the Engli&s;h. <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> had conceived a Prayer in wri|ting, in the end whereof he prote|&s;ted his innocencie: which Prayer he read to his fellows the night before, and now al&s;o at the place of execution devoutly pronoun|ced the &s;ame; then threw away the paper, which the Governour cau&s;ed to be brought to him, and kept it,</P>
<P><HI>Emanuel Tom&s;on</HI> told the re&s;t, he did not doubt but GOD would &s;hew &s;ome &s;ign of their innocen|cy; and every one of the re&s;t took it &s;everally upon their death, that they were utterly guiltle&s;s; and &s;o one by one with great cheerful|ne&s;s &s;uffered the fatal &s;troke.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugal</HI> prayed over his Beads very devoutly, and often ki&s;&s;ed the Cro&s;s; &s;wearing there|upon, that he was utterly innocent of this trea&s;on: yet confe&s;&s;ed, that God had ju&s;tly brought this pu|ni&s;hment upon him, for that ha|ving a wife in his own Countrey, he had, by the per&s;wa&s;ion of the Dutch Governour, taken another in that Countrey, his fir&s;t being yet living.</P>

But neither of them was executed, nor &s;o much as con|demned. The rea&s;on whereof was not known to the Engli&s;h that were &s;aved.</P>
<P>They had prepared a cloath of black Velvet, for Captain <HI>Tower|&s;ons</HI>'s body to fall upon; which being &s;tained and defaced with his bloud, they afterwards put to the account of the Engli&s;h Com|pany.</P>
<P>At the in&s;tant of the execu|tion, there aro&s;e a great dark|ne&s;s,
<PB N="49" REF="40">with a &s;udden and violent gu&s;t of wind and tempe&s;t; where|by two of the Dutch &s;hips, riding in the harbour, were driven from their Anchors, and with great labour and defficulty &s;aved from the Rocks. Within a few dayes after, one <HI>William Dunckin,</HI> who had told the Governour. That <HI>Robert Brown,</HI> the Engli&s;h Tai|lour, had a few Moneths before told him, he hoped, that within &s;ix Moneths the Engli&s;h &s;hould have as much to do in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> as the Dutch: This fellow, coming upon an evening to the grave where the Engli&s;h were buried, being all (&s;ave Cap|tain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI>) in one pit, fell down upon the grave; and ha|ving lien there a while, ro&s;e up again &s;tark mad, and &s;o conti|nued two or three dayes toge|ther, and then died. Forthwith al&s;o fell a new &s;ickne&s;s at <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> which &s;wept away about a thou&s;and people Dutch and <HI>Am|boyners:</HI> in the &s;pace wherein, there u&s;ually died not above thirty at other &s;ea&s;ons.

<PB N="50" REF="41">referred to the confident pre|diction of <HI>Emanuel Tom&s;on</HI> a|above-named, and were by the <HI>Am|boyners</HI> interpreted as a token of the wrath of God for this barba|rous Tyranny of the Hollanders.</P>
<P>The next day after the execu|tion, being the eight and twen|tieth of February, <HI>Stilo veteri,</HI> was &s;pent in Triumph for the new General of the Dutch then pro|claimed, and in publick rejoycing for the deliverance from this pre|tended trea&s;on. The day follow|ing, being the fir&s;t of March, <HI>Iohn Beomont, George Sharrock, Ed|ward Collins,</HI> and <HI>William Webber,</HI> were brought to the Governour; who told <HI>Webber Beomont</HI> and <HI>Sharrock,</HI> that they were par|doned in Honour of the new Ge|neral; and <HI>Collins,</HI> that he was to go to <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> there to &s;tand to the favour of the General. So the Governour made them drink wine with him, and curteou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them: willing them to go and con&s;ult with the re&s;t that were &s;aved, who were fit to be placed in the &s;everal Factories. Which done, and their opinions
<PB N="51" REF="41">reported to the Governour, he accordingly commanded each to his place; adding, that he would thenceforth take upon him the pa|tronage and Government of the Engli&s;h Companies bu&s;ine&s;s. To which purpo&s;e, he had within a few dayes pa&s;t opened a Letter that came from the Engli&s;h Pre|&s;ident at <HI>Iaccatra,</HI> directed to Captain <HI>Tower&s;on;</HI> being (as he &s;aid) the fir&s;t Engli&s;h Letter that ever he intercepted; further, &s;ay|ing, that he was glad that he &s;ound by that Letter, that the Engli&s;h at <HI>Iaccatra</HI> were innocent touching this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Governour and Fi&s;cal ha|ving thus made an end at <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> di&s;patched them&s;elves for <HI>Banda:</HI> where they made very di|ligent enquiry again&s;t Captain <HI>Welden,</HI> the Engli&s;h Agent there; yet found no colour nor &s;hadow of guilt to lay hold on: but at la&s;t entertained him with courte|ous &s;peeches, profe&s;&s;ing to be very glad, that they found him, as well as the Engli&s;h at <HI>Iacca|tra,</HI> to be without &s;u&s;pition of this Trea&s;on (as they tearm it.)
<PB N="52" REF="42">Captain <HI>VVelden,</HI> perceiving the di&s;order and confu&s;ion of the Engli&s;h Companies affairs at <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> by means of this dealing of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> forthwith hired a <HI>Dutch Pinnace</HI> at <HI>Banda,</HI> and pa&s;|&s;ed to <HI>Amboyna:</HI> where, in&s;tantly upon his arrival, he re-called the Companies &s;ervants, &s;ent (as be|fore) by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour to the upper-factories.</P>
<P>Having enquired of them, and the re&s;t that were left at <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> of the whole proceedings lately pa&s;&s;ed, he found, by the con&s;tant and agreeing relation of them all, that there was no &s;uch Trea&s;on of the Engli&s;h as was pretended: as al&s;o under&s;tanding what &s;trict command the Gover|nour had given to the &s;urviving Engli&s;h, not once to talk or confer with the Countrey peo|ple concerning this bloudy bu&s;i|ne&s;s, although the &s;aid Countrey people every day reproched them with trea&s;on, and a bloudy in|tention to have ma&s;&s;acred the Natives, and to have ripped up the bellies of women with child, and &s;uch like &s;tuff; wherewith
<PB N="53" REF="42">the Dutch have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the poor Vulgar, to make the Eng|li&s;h odious unto them. The &s;aid M. <HI>VVelden</HI> therefore finding it to &s;ort neither with the Honour nor profit of the Engli&s;h Compa|ny, his Ma&s;ters, to hold any longer re&s;idence in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> he took the poor remnant of the Engli&s;h along with him, in the &s;aid hired <HI>Pinnace</HI> for <HI>Iaccatra;</HI> whither the Governour had &s;ent <HI>Iohn Beomont</HI> and <HI>Edward Collins</HI> before, as men condemned, and left to the mercie of the Ge|neral.</P>
<P>When this heavy news of <HI>Am|boyna</HI> came to <HI>Iaccatra</HI> and the Engli&s;h there, the Pre&s;ident forth|with &s;ent to the General of the Dutch, to know by what Au|thority the Governour of <HI>Am|boyna</HI> had thus proceeded again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and how he and the re&s;t of the Dutch there at <HI>Iac|catra,</HI> did approve the&s;e proceed|ings. The Governour returned for an&s;wer, that, The Governour of <HI>Amboyna</HI>'s Authority was de|rived from that of the Lords States General of the United
<PB N="54" REF="43">Neatherlands; under whom he had lawfull Juri&s;diction both in Criminal and civil cau&s;es, within the de&s;trict of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> further, that &s;uch proceeding was nece&s;|&s;ary again&s;t Traitours, &s;uch as the Engli&s;h executed at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> might appear to be by their own confe&s;&s;ions: a Copy whereof he therewith &s;ent to the Eng|li&s;h Pre&s;ident; who &s;ent the &s;ame back to be Authentickly certifi|ed, but received it not again.</P>
<P>Hitherto hath been recited the bare and naked Narration of the Progre&s;s and pa&s;&s;age of this acti|on, as it is taken out of the Depo|&s;itions of &s;ix &s;everal Engli&s;h Fa|ctors; whereof four were con|demned, and the other two ac|quitted in this Proce&s;s of <HI>Amboy|na:</HI> all, &s;ince their return into England, examined upon their Oaths in the Admiralty Court. The particular of Captain <HI>Tower|&s;on</HI>'s, as al&s;o of <HI>Emanuel Tom&s;on</HI>'s examinations and an&s;wers, are not yet come to light, by rea&s;on that the&s;e two were kept apart from all the re&s;t, and each alone by him&s;elf; nor any other of the

The like ob&s;cu|rity is yet touching the examina|tions and an&s;wers of diver&s;e of the re&s;t that are executed; being, during their impri&s;onment, &s;o &s;trictly lookt to, and watched by the Dutch, that they might not talk together, nor mutually re|late their mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the Hollanders defend their own proceedings by the confe&s;&s;ions of the parties exe|cuted, acknowledging &s;everally under their hands, that they were guilty of the pretended crime; it will not be ami&s;s to recollect and recall unto this place, as it were unto one &s;um and totall, certain circum&s;tances di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal parts of this Narration; whereby, as well the innocencie of the Engli&s;h, as the unlawfull proceedings again&s;t them, may be manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore it is to be re|membred, that the <HI>Japons</HI> were
<PB N="56" REF="44">apprehended, examined, and tor|tured three or four dayes, before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were attached; and the fame as well of their appre|hen&s;ion, as torture, was rife and notorious in the Town of <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> and the parts adjoyning. <HI>Tom&s;on,</HI> in this <HI>interim,</HI> and the very fir&s;t day of the examination of the <HI>Japon,</HI> went to the Ca&s;tle to ask leave of the Governour to land &s;ome Rice, and brought back the news with him to the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of the cruel hand|ling of the&s;e poor <HI>Iapons.</HI> This had been <HI>Item</HI> enough to the Engli&s;h, if they had been guilty, to &s;hift for them&s;elves: whereto al&s;o they had ready means by the Curricurries or &s;mall Boats of the <HI>Amboyners,</HI> which lie along the Strand in great number, wherewith they might ea&s;ily have tran&s;ported them&s;elves to <HI>Seran,</HI> to <HI>Bottoom,</HI> or to <HI>Macca&s;&s;ar,</HI> out of the reach and Juri&s;diction of the Dutch; but in that they fled not in this ca&s;e, it is a very &s;trong pre&s;umption, that they were as little privy to any trea|&s;on of their own, as &s;u&s;picious of
<PB N="57" REF="44">any treachcerous tran laid for their blouds.</P>
<P>In the next place let it be con|&s;idered, how impo&s;&s;ible it was for the Engli&s;h to atchieve this pre|tended enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboyna</HI> is of a very great &s;trength (as is before declared;) the Garri&s;on therein two or three hundred men, be&s;ides as many more of their free Bur|gers in the Town. What their care and circum&s;pection in all their Forts is, may appear, not one|ly by the quick Alarm they now took at the fooli&s;h que&s;tion of the poor <HI>Japon,</HI> made to the Sentinel above-recited; but al&s;o by that which a little before happened at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> where one of their Soul|diers was &s;hot to death for &s;leep|ing in the watch.</P>
<P>Dur&s;t ten Engli&s;h men (where|of not one a Souldier) attempt any thing upon &s;uch a &s;trength and vigilancie? As for the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the <HI>Japons,</HI> they were but ten neither, and all un-armed as well as the Engli&s;h: For, as at the &s;eizure of the Engli&s;h hou&s;e, all the provi&s;ion therein found
<PB N="58" REF="45">was but three &s;words, two Mu&s;|kets, and half a pound of powder: &s;o the <HI>Japons</HI> (except when they are in &s;ervice of the Ca&s;tle, and there armed by the <HI>Dutch</HI>) are al|lowed to have no Arms, but one|ly a <HI>Catan,</HI> a kind of &s;hort &s;word: and it is forbidden to all the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon great penaltie, to &s;ell any hand-gun, powder or bullets to the <HI>Japons</HI> or <HI>Amboyners.</HI> But let it be imagined, that the&s;e 20 per&s;ons <HI>Engli&s;h &amp; Japons,</HI> were &s;o de&s;perate as to adventure the ex|ploit; how &s;hould they be able to ma&s;ter the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Ca&s;tle, or to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when they had gotten it? what &s;econd had they? There was neither Ship nor Pin|nace of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the harbor. All the re&s;t of the <HI>Japons</HI> in the I&s;land, were not twenty per&s;ons, and not one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> more. The neare&s;t of the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were at <HI>Banda,</HI> forty leagues from <HI>Amboyna;</HI> and tho&s;e but nine per|&s;ons, all afterwards cleared by the Governour and <HI>Fi&s;cal</HI> them&s;elves from all &s;u&s;pition of this pretend|ed crime, as were al&s;o the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Jaccatra.</HI></P>
<PB N="59" REF="45">
<P>On the other &s;ide, be&s;ides the &s;trength of the Ca&s;tle and Town of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have three other &s;trong Ca&s;tles, well furni&s;hed with Souldiers in the &s;ame I&s;land, and at <HI>Cam|bello</HI> near adjoyning. They had then al&s;o in the road of <HI>Amboy|na</HI> eight Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, name|ly, the <HI>Rotterdam</HI> of 1200 Tun, the <HI>Unicorn</HI> of 300 Tun, the Free-mans Ve&s;&s;el of 100 Tun, the <HI>Calck</HI> of 60 Tun, Captain <HI>Gamals Junck</HI> of 40 Tun, the <HI>Flute</HI> of 300 Tun, the <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> of 1400 Tun, and a &s;mall Pinnace of about 60 Tun; and all the&s;e well furni&s;hed with men and Ammunition. It is true, that the Stories do record &s;undry valiant and hardy enterpri&s;es of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation, and <HI>Holland</HI> is wit|ne&s;s of &s;ome of them, yea, hath reaped the fruit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;olution; yet no Storie, no Le|gend &s;carcely reporteth any &s;uch hardine&s;s, either of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or others, That &s;o few per&s;ons, &s;o naked of all provi&s;ions &amp; &s;up|plies, &s;hould undertake &s;uch an adventure upon a counter-party,
<PB N="60" REF="46">&s;o well and abundantly fitted at all points.</P>
<P>But let it be further granted, that they might po&s;&s;ibly have overcome all the&s;e difficulties; yet to what end and purpo&s;e &s;hould they put them&s;elves into &s;uch a jeopardie? They knew well enough, that it was agreed be|tween both companies at home, That the Forts in the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;hould remain re&s;pectively in the hands of &s;uch, as had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them at the date of the Trea|ty, <HI>Anno</HI> 1619. and that the &s;ame was ratified by the Kings Maje&s;tie, and the Lords States General. They knew likewi&s;e, and all the world takes know|ledge of his Maje&s;ties Religious ob&s;ervation of Peace and Treatie with all his neighbours, yea, with all the world: what reward then could the&s;e Engli&s;h hope for, of this their Valour and danger? Certainly none other than that which is expre&s;ly provided by the Treaty it &s;elf, that is, To be puni&s;hed as the di&s;turbers of the Common Peace, and Amity of both Nations.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="E"> In the I&s;lands lying far Ea&s;t|ward of <HI>Banda,</HI> it was al&s;o &s;aid, and the News went currantly there, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;ure enough quit of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> And at that time there were divers &s;ecret corre&s;ponden|cies between the <HI>Indians,</HI> &amp; others, which gave us great &s;u&s;pition.

When things were in &s;uch a &s;tate in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> there came forth and was wonderfully di&s;covered, in February 1623. a horrible con&s;piracie again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, and Per&s;on of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, and the whole &s;tate of <HI>Amboyna:</HI> and fir&s;t, by the ap|prehen&s;ion of a certain <HI>Iaponian</HI> (a complice of the feat) who at an un&s;ea&s;onable time was often &s;een upon the wall of the Ca&s;tle, where he al&s;o over-curiou&s;ly en|quired of the mo&s;t unskilfull and fillie&s;t Souldiers, touching the &s;et|ing, and change of the Watch, and what number of people might be in the Ca&s;tle, and many other things. Whereupon, in the very Act, the &s;aid <HI>Iaponian</HI> was appre|hended, and being examined of many circum&s;tances, he confe&s;&s;ed that the <HI>Iaponian</HI> Souldiers un|der

<P><MILESTONE N="L"> The &s;aid <HI>Gabriel Tower&s;on</HI> be|ing asked in particular; what moved him to &s;uch a wicked fact; he an&s;wered, the de&s;ire of Honour and profit. Being fur|there demanded, who &s;hould in|joy that Honour and Profit, and for whom he would have taken
<PB N="13" REF="56">the Ca&s;tle: he an&s;wered, That if he did obtain his de&s;ire, he &s;hould pre&s;ently have adverti&s;ed tho&s;e of his Nation being in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and called for their help, who if they had &s;ent him &s;uccour, he would have kept the Ca&s;tle for his own Company, <HI>viz.</HI> (for the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Company) and if not, he would have held it for him|&s;elf, and have endeavoured a peace with the <HI>Indians,</HI> that &s;o by the one means or the other, he might attain his purpo&s;e. After the examination of <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> was ended, <MILESTONE N="M"> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour in <HI>Amboyna</HI> upbraided <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> of his cruel intent, and asked, if this &s;hould have been the recompence of the manifold honours, and kindne&s;&s;es he had done unto him. Whereto <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> an&s;wered with a deep &s;igh, Oh, if it were to be begun, it &s;hould not be done. This voluntarie confe&s;&s;ion, and penitent acknowledgement, with much &s;orrow, was made the 9. of March, being the day when the execution &s;hould have been done; but the examination of <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> was ended the 18. of February,

<P>What crime this intended pro|dition was, is hence very manife&s;t, and undoubted: what puni&s;hment is due to treacherie, according to the Law and Cu&s;toms of all Na|tions, is al&s;o well known: no true Chri&s;tian man will patronage any &s;uch horrible attempt, but will ad|judge it worthy of death, as it was determined upon the compli|ces of this con&s;piracie, according to order of Ju&s;tice, as there in <HI>Am|boyna</HI> it is exerci&s;ed (according to de&s;ert) by the Governour and Councel, in the name of the High and Mighty Lords, the <HI>States.</HI></P>
<P>Here you have (Sir) the very &s;ub&s;tance of the Truth, both of the Fact and puni&s;hment; other than which, many things are &s;pread abroad in <HI>England,</HI> but up|on what pretence, or intendment, I know not; let the matter it &s;elf &s;peak for it &s;elf.</P>

Now then the <HI>Japonian</HI> Souldi|diers, being in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> Company in <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> are discovered to have con|&s;pired again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, and the Governour there, under who&s;e Oath and pay they were; they were apprehended, and examined, and convicted of the &s;aid con&s;pi|racie. This proceeding is Law|full, and toucheth no man, be|cau&s;e the &s;aid <HI>Japonians</HI> knew no other Ma&s;ter than the <HI>Neather|landers,</HI> under who&s;e Oath, &s;er|vice, and pay they &s;tand. All the&s;e <HI>Japonian</HI> con&s;piratours with the &s;aid <HI>Merincho,</HI> a Captain of the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> Slaves, confe&s;&s;ed with one mouth, that they were moved and induced to this con|&s;piracie, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants re&s;ident in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> who&s;e names they named. Now, not onely the right of <HI>Neatherland,</HI> but of <HI>England,</HI> and of the whole World requireth, that the Au|thours, abettours and complices of Murder and Trea&s;on, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death; whereto, according to the common Laws,
<PB N="18" REF="59">as al&s;o the particular Laws of every Kingdom or Dominion, the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons fir&s;t, and be|fore all, &s;hould be impri&s;oned, not onely for preventing the ef|fect of their evil purpo&s;e, but that they might al&s;o receive their de&s;erved puni&s;hment: which ap|prehen&s;ions, could not (in that place) be done by any other man, than by the command of the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> Governour, to whom it belongeth to take care, to &s;ee every act concerning Su|pream power to be there ob&s;er|ved; <MILESTONE N="O"> and e&s;pecially (all other rea&s;ons cea&s;ing) the highe&s;t <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Officers there, could not ap|prehend the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;pira|tours, becau&s;e all the chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants in <HI>Amboyna</HI> were them&s;elves of the con&s;pira|cie, and complices of the fact, up|on which the apprehen&s;ion was made. Therefore the apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> complices mu&s;t be done by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, who therefore hath therein pro|ceeded according to the cu&s;tom of all Nations of the world. <MILESTONE N="P"> And that the&s;e apprehen&s;ions may be
<PB N="19" REF="59">holden more Lawfull; it appear|eth out of the written proce&s;s, that the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> complices were not impri&s;oned upon the fir&s;t &s;u|&s;pitions &amp; gro&s;s evidences, which were had again&s;t them, but then at la&s;t, when all the <HI>Japonian</HI> Soul|diers were taken, examined, and convicted, and had di&s;covered by the uniform confe&s;&s;ion of all the eleven, the names and &s;ur|names of &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as had per|&s;waded and hired them to this fact; of which <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> viz.

<P><MILESTONE N="Q"> The &s;econd point which is abu|&s;ively di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Oubject"> again&s;t this execution, is, that it is &s;aid, that it did not appertain to the <HI>Neatherlanders</HI> in <HI>Amboyna</HI> to im|pri&s;on the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to proceed again&s;t them, or to pu|ni&s;h them; but that it did belong to the Councel of Defence re&s;i|dent at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting half of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and half of <HI>Neather|landers,</HI> according to the Treaty of the year 1619. made between his <HI>Maje&s;tie</HI> and the Lords the States, between the two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies. That I might the better inform my &s;elf thereof, I took in hand, and peru&s;ed the general Treaty of 1619. with the explication following there|upon; but I profe&s;s, that (as I think) every under&s;tanding man, (not loving di&s;cord) mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that neither in the &s;aid Trea|tie, nor in the enlargement, any one Article or word could be
<PB N="21" REF="60">perceived, whereby (according to that which is untruely &s;aid in <HI>England</HI>) either this, or any &s;uch thing is ordained, or decided, by the &s;aid Treaty, as it ought to have clearly been in &s;o great and important a point, as this part of Juri&s;diction is. I appeal to all wi&s;e men, who I de&s;ire may judge of this, whether this &s;peech of &s;ome in <HI>England</HI> (to wit, that the &s;aid Councel of defence &s;hould (alone) have judged the&s;e con&s;piratours) be agreable to the &s;aid Treaty, or contrarie to the &s;ame. I find many Arguments for my Negative opinions, to wit, that before the Treaty of 1619. the <HI>Duch</HI> in <HI>Amboyna</HI> admini&s;tred Juri&s;diction, and Judicature, up|on all and every one who dwelt in or under the Juri&s;diction of the Ca&s;tle, as well inhabitants as &s;trangers, without difference; and that in this &s;aid Treaty, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants, made onely a league in the matter of commerce and Nego|tiation of <HI>Nutmegs, Mace, Cloves;</HI> and <HI>Pepper,</HI> in &s;ome quarters, without having any further Trea|ty,
<PB N="22" REF="61">or communication in the land; &s;o that without the bounds of this common Negotiation, every one remained free, and un|hindered in the land by the right and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which either Com|pany enjoyed, and exerci&s;ed &s;eve|rally, according as the &s;ame ap|peareth out of the 23 Article of the Treatie: where it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>That ca&s;tles and Furts &s;hall remain</HI> in their hands who at pre|&s;ent do po&s;&s;e&s;s them: And out of the 13.14.15. Articles of the Treatie, all may &s;ee, that this common Councel of Defence hath no more power, &s;ave onely over the fellow&s;hip of the Trea|tie, that is, over the Navie of defence in the Sea, to the de|fence of the common Merchan|dize, and liberty of commerce; and la&s;tly, to tax the charges for the provi&s;ion of ammunition in the Forts: neither can any o|ther thing be &s;incerely collected out of the &s;aid Treaty, &s;o far as I can conceive. Therefore this &s;econd point is found to be un|true and abu&s;ive, being not founded upon the &s;aid Treatie,
<PB N="23" REF="61">which Treatie (not with&s;tanding) ought to be the onely rule, both of the one and the other Company.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="R"> Finally, it is given out in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that in the examination of the Con&s;piratours there was ex|ce&s;s in the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> Judges, in the point of Torture: I ac|knowledge, that no argument or pretext again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of this execution, hath more moved me in the beginning, than this pre|tence of exce&s;s afore&s;aid, becau&s;e this &s;tirreth Chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion; although I al&s;o judge, that wi&s;e men will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be too much tran&s;ported thereby, before the true rea&s;ons do fully appear, which &s;hould move us thereunto. For, I well remember yet, that in the time of former mi|&s;takings in the <HI>Indies</HI> many things were pretended on both parts, up|on which, there were great outcries one either &s;ide, which yet, by due examination, were found to be (though fair, yet) fal&s;e pretexts of &s;ome ill-willers, and men de&s;irous to wrangle: which pretences being throughly &s;ifted by the High and much admired wi&s;dom of his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="62">&amp; the Lords, the <HI>States,</HI> were well di&s;covered to be no &s;uch matters as they were made: as it is al&s;o undoubtedly to be believed, that his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> will yet further do in this affair: and &s;o the cau&s;e of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company may be (in the carriage hereof) rightly ju&s;tified. Of which I under&s;tand that the Lords the <HI>States</HI> have &s;pecial re|gard, and that they have been throughly informed, what is the very truth of the things there pa&s;t, and of the Execution in <HI>Amboyna</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con|&s;piratours. Unto which end the Lords the <HI>States</HI> re&s;olved to &s;ee and peru&s;e all the Papers and Letters, touching the &s;aid pro|ceedings: And now thereupon men &s;peak far otherwi&s;e than heretofore; for pretences, and ca|vils (being once detected) cannot &s;tand with truth. And it doth plainly appear, that there is little truth in the matter of Torture, reported to be mo&s;t cruelly infli|cted upon the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;pi|ratours, as in <HI>England</HI> it is &s;aid. And I have ever &s;u&s;pected this
<PB N="25" REF="62">for a &s;lander: for I know the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation doth naturally ab|hor this kind of cruelty, and are as much moved to commi&s;era|tion, as any other people. But whether the&s;e evil minded men, who have &s;cattered this great &s;lander in <HI>England,</HI> and have &s;o fowly defaced a ju&s;t cau&s;e, have done it by occa&s;ion of our u&s;e of Tortures in the&s;e Lands, in &s;ome weighty cau&s;es, according to the cu&s;tom of the mo&s;t Dominions of <HI>Europe;</HI> I cannot Judge. But is that to be cen&s;ured &amp; Judged to be unju&s;t of the whole world, which is repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> (or any one Nation) where Torture is rarely u&s;ed? Nothing &s;o; but the Ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of a cau&s;e mu&s;t be (as afore&s;aid) determined, according to the Laws where it is done, and not of other Lands. If this were not &s;o, why then &s;hould not the whole World much more Judge that as a hard, &amp; a thing unheard (and therefore condemnable) which in &s;ome cau&s;es is u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> according to the Laws there, when they proceed again&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="63">&s;ome guiltie per&s;ons; who being once &amp; again asked of the Judge, and utterly refu&s;ing to be legally tried, is adjudged as dumb, that is, by contumacie; who&s;e con|demnation then accordingly fol|loweth, that he is laid upon a ta|ble, or plank, and another plank upon him, and &s;o much weight of &s;tone or lead laid upon him, that his body is mi&s;erably brui&s;ed, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ed violently to death. The which, according to the con&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Nations, (e&s;pe|cially, becau&s;e this kind of ju&s;tice is not u&s;ed in other Lands) and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers, is judged to be one of the mo&s;t &s;harp and &s;evere kinds of death, that can be invented; yet cannot &s;uch an ex|ecution be called cruel and un|lawfull, when it is done in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> becau&s;e it is done accord|ing to the Laws of that Land, though &s;trangers &s;hall judge o|therwi&s;e of it. And in like man|ner the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation cannot complain of the Torture which evil-willers &s;ay, was u&s;ed upon the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;piratours in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> becau&s;e it is done ac|cording

<P>And to &s;ay the Truth, without taking parts, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;pi|ratours being affronted with the uniform &amp; written confe&s;&s;ions of the 11 <HI>Japonians</HI> (their complices) which could convince them &s;uf|ficiently according to the laws, &amp; find them guilty of the &s;ame con|&s;piracie, &amp; con&s;equently of death: if now, not with&s;tanding this they had per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;tout denial of the fact, were not this, (to (&s;peak according to the manner in <HI>England</HI>) enough to judge them dumb by contumacie, and &s;o to e&s;teem them worthy of this &s;ore puni&s;hment of Pre&s;&s;ing to
<PB N="28" REF="64">death, as is afore-&s;aid? but this tor|ture of ours (if any in <HI>Amboyna</HI> were &s;o tortured) is to be judged far le&s;s, than that pre&s;&s;ing, where the Malefactor doth &s;uffer &s;uch extream mi&s;erie, as cannot be imagined, and which is not to be lenified or ea&s;ed at all, but ended by death. But to the &s;ufficient fatisfaction of my &s;elf, and your Wor&s;hip, and all men, and not to &s;peak according to the &s;en|tence, and con&s;cience of others; I have u&s;ed all diligence to get into my hands the written <HI>Pro|ce&s;s,</HI> concerning the Con&s;pira|tours in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> which I ob|tained authentically, and read carefully, and I find, that all, that is by me above&s;aid, is con|firmed, to wit, That the <HI>Japonian</HI> Complices were examined, and made their confe&s;&s;ions as afore|&s;aid, for three dayes, <HI>viz.</HI> the 23, 24, 25. of <HI>February,</HI> 1623. and that all this being done, and con|&s;ummated before, then at la&s;t, is <HI>Gabriel Tower&s;on,</HI> fir&s;t with the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Complices im|pri&s;oned, the &s;aid 25. of <HI>Febru|ary,</HI> when their examination and
<PB N="29" REF="64">confe&s;&s;ion began, &amp; continued di|vers dayes, without over-ha&s;ting till the third of <HI>March.</HI> And the &s;aid examinations and confe&s;&s;i|ons being &s;o fini&s;hed, the <HI>Neather|lands</HI> Governour and Councel, deliberated whether the puni&s;h|ment might be deferred to any long time, or referred to any other place; but it was &s;o con|cluded by joynt con&s;ent of all, that the &s;aid puni&s;hment (there de&s;erved) mu&s;t be executed in the &s;ame place for example, and that it could not (in any wi&s;e) be de|layed without extream danger, for rea&s;ons there related; and among others', becau&s;e the <HI>Tar|natanes,</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> had otherwi&s;e than they were wont, rebelled; neither could it be fully known, what great co~|federacie the&s;e Con&s;piratours had made with them, and others. And touching any extraordina|rie, and cruel Torture, I have ac|curatly over-looked every ones confe&s;&s;ion, but I find not one word in any one, which maketh any mention of &s;uch Torture, as is unju&s;tly &s;poken of in <HI>England;</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="65">nay, &s;carce find any mention of that ordinarie Torture, which is in u&s;e, &s;ave onely the&s;e words, in one act of the 25 February 1623. viz. <HI>The Councel being gathered to|gether, have thought meet, that all the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>&s;hould be pre&s;ently ex|amined one after another (as accord|ingly it was in&s;tantly done) and &s;ome of them,</HI> before any torture, others, after a little (or rather a touch) of it, <HI>confe&s;&s;ed as followeth.</HI> Unto which, followeth pre&s;ently, the particular confe&s;&s;ion of each one, &s;ub&s;cribed with his own hand, as afore&s;aid.

<P><MILESTONE N="S"> And thus your Wor&s;hip hath the upright, and impartial truth of this bu&s;ine&s;s, touching the whole pa&s;&s;age as it proceeded, and the puni&s;hment as it was inflicted; from which, &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were exempted by favour, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> goods &s;hould not be lo&s;t,

<P>And of this information, (which I &s;end in love, and ho|nour to your <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> as unto <HI>a lover of Truth,</HI> and <HI>a hater of Treacherie</HI>) you may make &s;uch u&s;e, as to you &s;hall &s;eem good, in any place where you come, both for <HI>refutation</HI> of any thing alrea|dy reported contrarie thereunto, and for <HI>prevention</HI> of any further fal&s;e rumours, or clamours; and finally, for <HI>propagation</HI> of that un|doubted truth, which <HI>here</HI> (to

<HEAD>AN ANSWER To the <HI>Dutch</HI> Relation, touching the Pretended <HI>Con&s;piracie</HI> of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> at AMBOYNA in the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe <HI>Compiler</HI> of this Relation, percei|ving that he had an hard task to make it probable, that eighteen <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> Merchants and their &s;ervants, all un-armed, &s;hould, with the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ten <HI>Japons,</HI> like|wi&s;e un-armed, undertake the &s;urprize of a Ca&s;tle, &s;o provided every way, as that of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> is before in the Relation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> truly de&s;cribed to be: as al&s;o the &s;ame Author, well weigh|ing, that albeit all that he was to write of this pretended <HI>Con&s;pi|racie,</HI>

Wherefore although this be no direct charge of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but u&s;ed by the Author to &s;up|ply the want of probabilities in the proce&s;s it &s;elf, it will not be

<P><MILESTONE N="B"> The next point is, that the <HI>Ternatans</HI> in the <HI>Molluccos</HI> went about al&s;o to make truce with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> without con&s;ent or knowledge of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> wherein
<PB N="7" REF="70">this dealing of the Authour is wor&s;e than the former.

<P><MILESTONE N="C"> And yet this pretended fear and jealou&s;ie of the <HI>Molluccos</HI> is further amplified by the &s;trength of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> being then (as this Authour affirmeth) Ma&s;ter of the Sea there, and that by de|fault of the Engli&s;h; who, con|trarie to the Treatie of the year 1619, had de&s;erted the defence, and &s;ent no more &s;hips, neither to the <HI>Molluccos,</HI> nor to the <HI>Ma|nilliaes:</HI> whence now the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> had means to &s;end Ships, Gallies, and Pinnaces, to the <HI>Molluccos.</HI> What the &s;trength of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in the <HI>Molluccos</HI> (by Sea) was, at the time of this pre|tended fear, may appear by the exploits before mentioned, done upon them by the <HI>Curricurries</HI> of the <HI>Ternatans,</HI> without help of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But for the de|fault
<PB N="8" REF="71">of the Engli&s;h, which is here odiou&s;ly alleadged, it will be requi&s;ite to &s;et down the true cau&s;es, wherefore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re|linqui&s;hed the action of defence, as well at the <HI>Manilliaes,</HI> as el&s;e|where; being a matter much ag|gravated upon all occa&s;ions by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> albeit them&s;elves have given the cau&s;e thereof. Wherefore &s;hortly, the true mo|tives of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their de&s;i&s;ting from the action of defence, were as followeth. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had by agreement of the Councel of de|fence, two years together main|tained a Fleet of five tall &amp; war|like &s;hips, to joyn with the like &s;trength of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for the action of the <HI>Manilliaes,</HI> and the profit of the Voyage (as the charge) to be common to both Companies. The <HI>Dutch</HI> prepared another Fleet of &s;even &s;hips, all of their own, for <HI>Macao,</HI> bordering upon <HI>China,</HI> near the <HI>Manilliaes,</HI> without giving knowledge there|of to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> until their Fleet was ready to depart thence; well knowing, that up|on &s;uch warning it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="9" REF="71">for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to pre|pare a like force to joyn with them. To tho&s;e they appointed al&s;o eight <HI>Pinaces</HI> that were then abroad, to joyn; and afterwards &s;ent another Ship with provi&s;ions unto them. This Fleet pa&s;&s;ing by two of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, which were appointed for that quarter of the <HI>Manilliaes;</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wel|comed them, and offered to joyn with them in their exploit: which the <HI>Dutch</HI> refu&s;ed, &s;aying, That this being an exploit of their own, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould neither parti|cipate of the fact, nor of the be|nefit that might ari&s;e thereby. Likewi&s;e, by agreement of the Councel of defence of both Na|tions, there was another Fleet of ten Ships &s;et forth at the equal charge of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> for the coa&s;t of <HI>Malla|bar,</HI> to &s;ecure the Trade in that part. Of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships (about a moneth after they &s;et &s;ail) two were found to be &s;o weak and leak, that they were fain to re|turn to <HI>Jaccatra.</HI> The re&s;t being come to their quarter, two of the be&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were
<PB N="10" REF="72">&s;ent away by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, for the Red-&s;ea, contrarie to their in&s;tructions and Commi&s;&s;ion at <HI>Jaccatra</HI> from the Councel of de|fence, and notwith&s;tanding the prote&s;tations, obte&s;tations and ex|clamations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t this prevarication.

By this it appeareth, what cau&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> have to complain of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for de&s;erting the action of de|fence, and what rea&s;on and en|couragement the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have to continue the joynt action and charge with tho&s;e that u&s;e &s;o lit|tle &s;incerity, ever contriving the common actions and charge to their private advantage; that when the joint forces are imploy|ed to give the enemy work in one

<P>After this ended, the Go|vernour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> made out a Fleet of <HI>Curricurries,</HI> to procure reparation of tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es; and therein not going &s;o &s;trong as he might, was braved by tho&s;e <HI>Ter|natanes</HI> of <HI>Amboyna.</HI> But this was after the apprehen&s;ion and execution of the Engli&s;h; and

A &s;weet con|ceit, and &s;uch a &s;ervice as per|haps hath been &s;ometimes repre|&s;ented upon a &s;tage, but never act|ed in &s;urpri&s;e of a Ca&s;tle in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how eight of the <HI>Japons</HI> were to be imployed; what &s;hould the other two have
<PB N="22" REF="78">done? for&s;ooth they &s;hould have waited in the great chamber to murder the Governour. Yea, but this relation told us yer while, that this plot &s;hould have been executed when the Gover|nour was abroad upon &s;ome acti|on. How then &s;hould the&s;e two <HI>Japons</HI> have killed him in the Ca|&s;tle, at the &s;ame time? But we &s;ee how all the <HI>Japons</HI> (that is) all the pretended party of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> within the Ca&s;tle, &s;hould have been occupied. Who &s;hould have opened the gates to the Engli&s;h, and their other aids? who &s;hould have killed the Court of guard at the Gate? The&s;e parts were left for them that were without; therefore let us take a review of them, what they were. The Relation mu&s;tereth them to be fourteen Engli&s;h, whereof ele|ven were Merchants; one Stew|ard of the hou&s;e, one Tailor, and one Barber, to dre&s;s the wound|ed, be&s;ides God knows how ma|ny Engli&s;h &s;hippers, Slaves, and <HI>Ternatans:</HI> Fir&s;t, for the Eng|li&s;h Merchants, of what dexte|ritie they are to take Forts, is
<PB N="23" REF="78">ea&s;ily judged; and in all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hou&s;e, when it was &s;eized by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon this pretend|ed Trea&s;on, the whole Provi&s;ion was but three Swords, two Hand-guns, and about half a pound of Powder. Yea, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip or &s;hips would have brought both fitter men and better provi&s;ion. But how knew Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> that tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips, when they came, would joyn with him in this work, being &s;o contrary to the Treaty, and it &s;elf &s;o danger|ous? or why did he not &s;tay the opening of the Plot till this &s;hip or &s;hips were come, that he might &s;wear the &s;hippers al&s;o, or at lea&s;t the chief Officers among&s;t them, and take their advice? Is it po&s;&s;ible that Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower|&s;on</HI> was &s;o &s;light, as to open his plot to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> yea, to the Tailor and Bar|ber, &s;o long before it was to be put in execution, and before he knew the minds of his chiefe&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tants, of who&s;e arrival he was &s;o uncertain? Yea, but he was &s;ure of the Slaves of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="79">and of the <HI>Ternatans</HI> of <HI>Lobo,</HI> with their <HI>Curricurries in quem|libet eventum.</HI> This indeed is the remainder of the Army; let us view them. The Slaves were, in all the Engli&s;h Factories, ju&s;t &s;ix in number, and all boys: The <HI>Ternatans</HI> were Enemies as well to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as is before &s;hewed in an&s;wer to the Preface. When were they re|conciled? how cometh it, that in all the examinations of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> this point was not &s;ifted, and &s;omewhat confe&s;&s;ed of it amid&s;t &s;o many Tortures? There is no confe&s;&s;ion thereof in all the examinations; and M^r^. <HI>Tower|&s;on</HI> in his expre&s;ly denied it, and was pre&s;&s;ed no further. The truth is, the Governour and Fi&s;|cal of <HI>Amboyna</HI> knew, that what ever had been confe&s;&s;ed in this point, would not have been believed by their own People there; who knew well enough, that the fir&s;t beginning of this breach between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Ternatans</HI> of <HI>Lobo,</HI> was about the Slave of the Engli&s;h: and the outrages thereupon following,
<PB N="25" REF="79">were done upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as well as upon the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Yet this Authour &s;eems to hope that that may be believed here in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> which had no colour at <HI>Am|boyna.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="K"> Concerning the time of exe|cuting this plot, it was not (as the Relation &s;aith) yet prefixed, but left to the next meeting of the Con&s;piratours, which &s;hould be &s;hortly holden, when <HI>Gabriel Tower&s;on</HI> had prepared all things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here was certainly a hot practice of Trea&s;on, and wor|thy to be tearmed by this Au|thour, An horrible con&s;piracie. They met together on New years day, and plotted as is before re|lated: and now it was the five, and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> and not onely nothing done all this <HI>Interim,</HI> but not &s;o much as a new con&s;ultation. But this (for|&s;ooth) is the body and &s;ub&s;tance of the unanimous confe&s;&s;ion of all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by them&s;elves &s;e|verally &s;ub&s;cribed. <MILESTONE N="L"> In the next place the Authour relateth &s;ome|what &s;ingular in M. <HI>Tower&s;on</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion; as that he &s;aid, he
<PB N="26" REF="80">was moved to this fact by hope and de&s;ire of honour and profit: and being demanded from whom he attended this honour, and for whom he meant to hold the Ca|&s;tle, his an&s;wer was, That if he could have compa&s;&s;ed his project, he would forthwith have given adverti&s;ement thereof to the re&s;t of his Nation at <HI>Jaccatra</HI> (which now they have chri&s;tened <HI>Bata|via,</HI>) and have craved their aid: which if they had yielded to him, then he would have held the Ca|&s;tle for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company; and if not, then he would have kept it for him&s;elf, and have u&s;ed means to have agreed with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and &s;o, by one means or other, would have compa&s;&s;ed the enterprize.</P>
<P>Here fir&s;t is to be ob&s;erved, that he would not (as this Au|thour makes him &s;peak) have &s;ent for aid to <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> until he were fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of the Ca&s;tle; and yet in the general confe&s;&s;ion before, it is &s;aid, he would attend the coming of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips or &s;hip, before he would adven|ture upon the Ca&s;tle. Next, let the
<PB N="27" REF="80">ambiguous and alternative re&s;o|lution, here &s;aid to be confe&s;&s;ed by Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower&s;on,</HI> be con&s;i|dered in both the parts thereof, and it will appear, that no man in his wits would have any &s;uch conceit as is here pretended. What hope could Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower|&s;on</HI> have, that the Pre&s;ident and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Councel at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> li|ving under command of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort there, and altogether Subject to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> dur&s;t join in any &s;uch action, thereby to give occa&s;ion to the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> to arre&s;t, torture and con|demn them of Trea&s;on? Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> knew well enough, that about &s;ix Moneths before, the General of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Jacca|tra,</HI> had caught at a very &s;light occa&s;ion to entrap the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident there: who having &s;ent out two of his people in the night to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cow-hou&s;e, to &s;ee what watch the <HI>Blacks</HI> in their &s;ervice kept over their Cattel; the &s;aid two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were appre|hended by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Souldiers, kept in pri&s;on &s;even dayes, and charged, that they had &s;aid, that
<PB N="28" REF="81">they went the Round: and one of them, being la&s;t examined, was told by the <HI>Balieu</HI> (the Officer of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in Criminal cau&s;es) that his fellow had confe&s;&s;ed, that they had &s;aid they went the Round, and that by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;idents Commi&s;&s;ion; and if he would not confe&s;s the &s;ame, he &s;hould be tortured: but the fel|low, being con&s;tant in the truth, came off at la&s;t without torture, yet this was <HI>Item</HI> enough to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident and Councel, how the intent of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was to entrap them upon the lea&s;t oc|ca&s;ion: and this, and other day|ly captious dealings of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Jaccatra,</HI> which were too long here to recite, were all adverti&s;ed from time to time to M. <HI>Tower|&s;on,</HI> who therefore was &s;ure he could expect no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, that were them&s;elves in in &s;uch a predicament. The other part of Mr <HI>Tower&s;on</HI>'s re&s;olution is &s;aid to have been, To keep the Ca&s;tle for him&s;elf, and to agree with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in default of help from the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This is yet more improbable than the former.
<PB N="29" REF="81">Were the <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> not able to keep out the <HI>Dutch</HI> from <HI>Amboyna,</HI> when they had no footing there; and &s;hall Cap|tain <HI>Tower&s;on,</HI> with twenty or thirty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Japons,</HI> with|out &s;hip or Pinnace, be able, with the help onely of the poor naked <HI>Indians,</HI> to drive them out, ha|ving already three Ca&s;tles in the I&s;lands of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and at <HI>Cam|bello</HI> hard by, all well furni&s;hed with men and provi&s;ion, be&s;ides their power of &s;hipping, which makes them &s;tile them&s;elves Lords of the Sea? And yet how could Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> hope to win the <HI>Amboynezes</HI> (the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> &s;worn Subjects) to his &s;ide? He might rather a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf, that after he had ma&s;tered the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (if yet that mu&s;t be believed to be po&s;&s;ible) the <HI>Amboynezes</HI> would have &s;ur|prized him, and ca&s;t him out (being &s;o weakly provided to &s;tand of him&s;elf,) that &s;o they might utterly free them&s;elve fro~ their &s;ervitude.

Whereby is not onely confe&s;&s;ed, how weak the <HI>Indians</HI> of them&s;elves are; but withall it followeth, how &s;mall hope Mr. <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> might have, being de&s;erted of his own Nation (as here the ca&s;e is put,) to hold the Ca&s;tle for him&s;elf by the help of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> if yet he could once have won it. In a word; they that know the power of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <HI>Amboyna</HI> and thereabouts, and the weaken&s;s of the poor <HI>Indians</HI> there, will judge this conceit of Ma&s;ter <HI>Tower&s;on</HI>'s (to keep the Ca&s;tle for him&s;elf) to be a mad plot; and for which, Ma&s;ter <HI>Tow|er&s;on</HI> &s;hould rather have been &s;ent to Bedlam, or the <HI>Dullen Ki&s;t</HI> (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> call it,) than to the Gallows. </P>

<PB N="33" REF="83">the Court or Councel at <HI>Amboy|na</HI> (and yet how &s;mall that is, is before &s;hewed) but upon the Atte&s;tation or Affidavit of the Governour and five others, the principal actors in this bloudy Tragedie: And this not upon their Oath, but upon their troth, or hone&s;t word (for&s;ooth) in &s;tead of an Oath. The time when the&s;e words were uttered by Mr. <HI>Tow|er&s;on,</HI> is not de&s;cribed by the day when he &s;pake them, but onely by the precedent Act of his exa|mination. And yet the circum|&s;tance of time is not onely an u&s;ual and cu&s;tomrie &s;olemnity, and requi&s;ite in all &s;uch Atte&s;ta|tions; but al&s;o in a bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature altogether nece&s;&s;arie: as likewi&s;e in this ca&s;e, that of the place was. For if the&s;e words were &s;poken in the place of Torture, or incontinently after the examina|tion ended, they are by their own Law, e&s;teemed no more volunta|rie, than the confe&s;&s;ion upon the Rack it &s;elf. Neither yet doth this Atte&s;tation affirm, that this confe&s;&s;ion was voluntarie. But this Authour, uncon&s;cionably
<PB N="34" REF="84">reporting the date of the Atte|&s;tation, for the time of the con|fe&s;&s;ion, collects it to be volun|tarie, becau&s;e (as he &s;aith) it was made the ninth of March, being &s;o many dayes after his examina|tion, which was taken the 28. of February. Can a man atte&s;t nothing but what was done up|on the very day when he maketh Affidavit?

Where|by appeareth, how faithfully the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Amboyna</HI> have entered the Acts of this proce&s;s. Well, at la&s;t he concludes the Narration of the confe&s;&s;ions, with the &s;um|ming up of the number and Na|tions of the parties, that had thus confe&s;&s;ed; which, he &s;aith, were ten <HI>Japons</HI> fourteen <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Neatherlandi&s;h Marnicho,</HI> or Captain of the Slaves By which la&s;t words, he would give the Reader occa&s;ion to think, that the fact was &s;o clear, and their own proceeding &s;o even and ju&s;t, that they had executed one of their own <HI>Neatherlanders</HI> for it. Which how true it is, is already declared in the conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Relation. The truth is, this Captain of the Slaves was of the <HI>Portugal</HI> race, and born in <HI>Bengala.</HI> His very name, <HI>Augu|&s;tin Perez,</HI> &s;heweth, he was no <HI>Neatherlander.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed this Re|lation, this Authour proceedeth to a di&s;putation: and taking no|tice
<PB N="38" REF="86">of &s;ome a&s;per&s;ions in <HI>Eng|land</HI> ca&s;t upon the&s;e proceedings at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> he divideth them into two heads; the one, that the proce&s;s was without its due formalitie; the other, that there was exce&s;s and extremitie u&s;ed again&s;t the Con&s;piratours. For the point of formalitie, he fir&s;t taketh great pains to prove, that the formalities of proce&s;s in <HI>Am|boyna,</HI> are not therefore unlaw|full, becau&s;e they agree not with our form in <HI>England.</HI> Which labour he might have &s;pared: for no wi&s;e man will denie him this point. And &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;o ignorant as to blame the <HI>Dutch</HI> for varying from us herein, were not worthy the an&s;wering. Here|withall al&s;o he deduceth the Ti|tle of the Lords States General to the Sovereignty of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> and &s;o the Governour of <HI>Amboy|na'es</HI> Juri&s;diction, in cau&s;es as well Criminal as Civil, to be rightly grounded. Thence he concludes, that the <HI>Japons</HI> being &s;worn &s;er|vants to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and in their pay, were Subject to the Juri&s;|diction of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour.
<PB N="39" REF="86">Then he telleth us, that the Au|thour, and complices of murther and trea&s;on, are by the Laws of all Nations to be puni&s;hed with death; all which points may be granted him without any preju|dice to the cau&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in this que&s;tion.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="Q"> Next, this Authour taketh notice of an objection made in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, and his Councel at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there; becau&s;e this power is, by the Treatie of the year 1619. di&s;po&s;ed of, and agreed to con&s;i&s;t in the Councel of defence of both Nations at <HI>Jaccatra.</HI> For information in which point this Authour &s;aith, he hath peru&s;ed over all the &s;eve|ral Articles of the &s;aid Treatie, and findeth in the 23. Article, that the Fortre&s;&s;es were to re|main in the hands of them that then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them; and in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fif|teenth, that the Councel of de|fence hath no other power, but onely over the Fleet of defence, over the commerce, and finally, to tax the charges of maintenance
<PB N="43" REF="88">of the Forts: But he could not &s;ee the thirtieth Article; which orders, that all di&s;putes that can|not be decided by the Councel of defence, &s;hould be remitted into <HI>Europe;</HI> fir&s;t, to the two com|panies there, and in default of their agreement, to the King and States. Why then was not this di&s;pute &s;o proceeded in? There is nothing in the former Articles, to limit the Councel of defence; and this general Ar|ticle appeareth to be added by way of ampliation, to provide for that which was not particu|larly and expre&s;ly cared for in the former. Which is mo&s;t plain by the words of the expla|nation upon this thirtieth Arti|cle, agreed upon at the fir&s;t, and &s;ub&s;cribed by the Commi&s;&s;io|ners on both &s;ides, Anno 1619. where this cour&s;e of proceeding is expre&s;ly directed, not onely in di&s;putes about the meaning of the Articles, but al&s;o about any o|ther matter hapning in their com|mon aboad. Since which al&s;o the Kings Maje&s;tie hath, upon a &s;mal|ler occa&s;ion, than the life of his
<PB N="44" REF="89">Subjects, clearly declared him&s;elf in the point of Sovereignrie; That both Nations in the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;hould wholly lay a&s;ide all pretence thereof. Which Declaration was &s;ent to the Lords States General, and by them accepted before this bloudie butcherie was executed. But if it were granted, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are ab&s;olute Lords of their partners, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in tho&s;e parts, without re&s;pect to the Trea|tie, yet at lea&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <HI>Amboyna</HI> are bound to ob&s;erve the Laws of the united Provin|ces; for &s;o &s;aith this Authour him&s;elf. Do the&s;e allow to be|gin the proce&s;s at the torture, and to bring per&s;ons of hone&s;t fame to the rack, upon others confe&s;&s;i|on made in the torture? Do their Laws allow of the leading inter|rogatories above mentioned to direct the pri&s;oner what to &s;ay, to avoid the torture? Where, in the United Provinces, is that drown|ing with water in u&s;e? or the tor|ture with fire, u&s;ed to <HI>John&s;on, Tomp&s;an,</HI> and <HI>Clark?</HI> or e&s;pecial|ly the &s;plitting of their toes, and launcing of the brea&s;t, and put|ing
<PB N="45" REF="89">in Gun-pouder, and then firing the &s;ame, whereby the body is not left intire, neither for innocencie, nor execution? <HI>Clark</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;on</HI> were both fain to be carried to their execution, though they were tortured many days before.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, their confe&s;&s;ions were contradictorie, apparently fal&s;e. and of things impo&s;&s;ible to be done, much le&s;s practi&s;ed before by the &s;aid parties; and therefore ought not by their law to have been believed, nor the pri&s;oners to have been condemned thereupon, without other &s;ufficient <HI>indicia</HI> or evidence be&s;ides.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, this Au|thour handleth the exce&s;s of torture whereof (he taketh notice) there is much com|plaint in <HI>England;</HI> and &s;aith, That the Lords States Gene|ral take great care to inform them&s;elves of all the pa&s;&s;ages of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and to that end have de&s;ired to &s;ee all the Letters, Pieces, and Papers that con|cern this proce&s;&s;e: by which it appeareth not, that there was
<PB N="46" REF="90">any cruel torture u&s;ed. But &s;up|po&s;e the Acts make no mention of them; is it any marvel that the Authours of this murtherous and tyrannous proce&s;s, being them|&s;elves the per&s;ons that al&s;o form|ed the Acts, would omit tho&s;e things that made again&s;t them? It is to be pre&s;umed al&s;o, that the Acts kept by their people at <HI>Polo|way</HI> in <HI>Banda,</HI> have omitted many things of their proce&s;s, again&s;t the poor <HI>Polaroons,</HI> whom in <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> 1622, being about 6 months before this execution of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> their Governour there u&s;ed in like &s;ort, as the Governour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> did the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and gave him a Model and precedent of this proce&s;s; which it will not be ami&s;s to relate briefly, becau&s;e this Authour, in the next place alleadgeth the mercifull di&s;po&s;iti|on of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> Nation in general; to inferr thence, that it is therefore unlikely, that their Governour at <HI>Amboyna</HI> was &s;o cruel as is reported in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Polaroon,</HI> one of the I&s;lands of <HI>Banda,</HI> was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at the time of the Treatie,
<PB N="47" REF="90"><HI>Anno</HI> 1619, and by the agreement was to remain theirs. After the Treatie came to the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> forbare the publi&s;hing thereof in the I&s;lands of <HI>Banda;</HI> untill they had taken <HI>Polaroon.</HI> But, knowing that it mu&s;t be re|&s;tored again, according to the Treatie, they fir&s;t take all cour&s;es to make the I&s;land little or no|thing worth: they demoli&s;h and deface the Building, transplant the Nutmeg-trees plucking them up by the roots, and carrying them into their own I&s;lands of <HI>Nera</HI> and of <HI>Poloway,</HI> there to be planted for them&s;elves; and at la&s;t find a means to dispeople the I&s;land, and to leave it &s;o, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might make no u&s;e of it, worth their charge of keeping; and that upon this occa&s;ion: There was a young man, the &s;on of an <HI>Orankey,</HI> or a Gentleman in <HI>Polaroon,</HI> that had committed Fe|lonie; for which by the Laws of his Countrey, he was to die. This fellow, to &s;ave his life, fled to an|other I&s;land of <HI>Banda,</HI> called <HI>Ro|finging,</HI> and there turned Chri&s;ti|an: but quickly under&s;tanding,
<PB N="48" REF="91">that that would not make him &s;afe from puni&s;hment, he went back &s;ecretly to his own countrey of <HI>Polaroon;</HI> and, having lurked there a few days, took his pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Nera,</HI> another I&s;land, where the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Fort; and told the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, that the <HI>Orankeys</HI> of <HI>Polaroon</HI> had con&s;pi|red to Ma&s;&s;acre the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as well at <HI>Polaroon,</HI> as at <HI>Poloway,</HI> with help of the people of <HI>Seran,</HI> that &s;hould &s;end over thirtie <HI>Curricur|ries</HI> for that purpo&s;e. Immedi|ately upon this <HI>indicium</HI> of this Malefactor, certain Prows, or Fi&s;her-boats of the <HI>Polaroons,</HI> that were fi&s;hing at <HI>Poloway,</HI> were &s;ei|&s;ed, and the people made pri&s;on|ers. Command was &s;ent by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour to <HI>Polaroon;</HI> that the <HI>Orankeys</HI> &s;hould come over to him, that there might be further inqui&s;ition made of this matter. The Prie&s;t of the <HI>Pola|roons</HI> and &s;eventie <HI>Orankes</HI> in&s;tantly took a Prow or &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of their own, and imbarked them|&s;elves for <HI>Poloway.</HI> As they were at &s;ea, and yet out of the &s;ight of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ca&s;tle, they were met
<PB N="49" REF="91">by a Fi&s;her-boat of <HI>Bandanezes,</HI> and told, how all the re&s;t were apprehended; and that, if they went to <HI>Poloway,</HI> they were all but dead men. Neverthele&s;s, the Prie&s;t and the re&s;t, although they had &s;pace and means to have e&s;ca|ped to <HI>Seran</HI> and other places &s;afe enough from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> yet were &s;o confident of their inno|cencie, that they would needs to <HI>Poloway</HI> to purge them&s;elves. Where, as &s;oon as they were arri|ved, they were in&s;tantly carried pri&s;oners to the Ca&s;tle: and with|all the Governour, with a force of two hundred men, went pre|&s;ently for <HI>Polaroon;</HI> whence he fetched all the re&s;t of the <HI>Orankeys,</HI> and brought them pri&s;oners to the &s;ame Ca&s;tle. As &s;oon as they were come, they were pre&s;ently brought to the torture of water and fire, even in the &s;ame &s;ort as our people were afterwards at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> onely herein differ|ing, that of tho&s;e at <HI>Poloway,</HI> two were &s;o tortured, that they died in their Tortures, the re&s;t, being one hundred and &s;ixtie two per&s;ons, were all,
<PB N="50" REF="92">upon their own forced confe&s;|&s;ions, condemned and executed. The Prie&s;t, when he came to the place of execution, &s;pake the&s;e words in the <HI>Maliaian</HI> tongue: All ye, great and &s;mall, rich and poor, black and white, look to it: we have committed no fault. And when he would have &s;poken more, he was ta|ken by the hands and feet, laid along, and cut in two by the middle with a &s;word. Forth|with, the Governour cau&s;ed the Wives, Children, and Slaves of tho&s;e of <HI>Polaroon,</HI> to be all car|ried out of the I&s;land, and di|&s;tributed in other I&s;lands &s;ubject to the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and &s;o have made a clear Countrey for the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> where they may both plant and gather them&s;elves, de&s;titute of the help of any of the Coun|trey people; without whom, neither the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nor <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> can maintain their Trade in the <HI>Indies.</HI> And yet this is not here recited, to the end thereby to charge the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> Na|tion with tho&s;e cruel proceed|ings, but the per&s;ons them&s;elves

For the Majors (as this Authour &s;ayes) u&s;e the <HI>Indies</HI> as a <HI>Tucht-hou&s;e</HI> or Bride-well, to manage their unruly and un|thrifty children and kindred; whom, when they cannot rule and order at home, they &s;end to the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they are prefer|red to Offices and places of Go|vernment. Yea, &s;aith he, they prefer &s;uch to be Fi&s;cals there, as never &s;aw Studie nor Law. So that it is no marvel, that &s;uch per&s;ons proceed not with that ju&s;tice and moderation as is u&s;ed generally in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> by the choice of the Nation there. And this agreeth well with the report of our Mer|chants of credite, that came lately from <HI>Amboyna;</HI> who aver, that, excepting the Governour him&s;elf, who is well &s;tept in years, of the re&s;t of the Councel there, as well the Fi&s;cal as others, there was &s;carce any that had hair on their faces, yea, that mo&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="93">of them are lewd drunken de|bauched per&s;ons; and yet mu&s;t be Judges as well of our <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as the poor <HI>Indians</HI> there.</P>
<P>Now to return to this Au|thours proofs, that there was no exce&s;s u&s;ed in the proceedings; at the la&s;t he taketh one Argument by way of compari&s;on, from the Law of <HI>England,</HI> to pre&s;s men to death: which he &s;aith, hath much more cruelty than their cour&s;e of Torture, u&s;ed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and is holden, as well by &s;ome Authours of our own Nation as others, for damnable. How pertinently is this matter of pre&s;&s;ing alleadged, for ju&s;tifying of their Tortures, &s;ince no man in <HI>England</HI> is pre&s;&s;ed for not con|fe&s;&s;ing, which is the cau&s;e of Torture in <HI>Dutchland?</HI> But the cau&s;e why any is pre&s;&s;ed, is, for that he ob&s;tinately refu&s;eth the Trial of his Countrey, and chal|lengeth the Judges as incompe|tent, which the Law appoint|eth him: which he doth (for the mo&s;t part) to &s;ave his goods, which, but by that ordinarie cour&s;e of Trial, cannot be con|fi&s;cate.
<PB N="53" REF="93">What is this to the point of confe&s;&s;ion, for refu&s;al where|of, the <HI>Dutch</HI> u&s;e the Torture? And yet no man blameth them for proceeding according to the Law of their Countrey herein; nor yet in their execution, when they break the legs, arms and thighs of the Malefactours, and then fet them upon a wheel on the end of a great pole, there to langui&s;h to death: an execution far more direfull than the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> pre&s;&s;ing, which is &s;o &s;udden|ly done, and &s;o &s;eldom u&s;ed. But why doth he not name the Authour of our own or forreign writers, which condemn this kind of execution? Let him do it yet, and he &s;hall have moe Au|thours of his own Countrey that condemn their cour&s;e of Tor|tures: and yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> com|plain not of the cour&s;e in gene|ral, but of the unlawfull u&s;e of it; contrarie to the rules of the Laws even of the United Pro|vinces. La&s;tly, in this point the Authour pretendeth, that little or no Torture was u&s;ed in this proce&s;s. What the Torture was,
<PB N="54" REF="94">and in what degree, appears in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Relation: but he can find little or none mentioned in the Acts. What if he will not find it? or what if their Officers of <HI>Amboyna</HI> have concealed it? &s;hall we not believe tho&s;e that &s;uffered it them&s;elves? &s;hall we not believe tho&s;e, that being them&s;elves acquitted, yet heard the cries, and &s;aw the bodies of <HI>John&s;on, Clark,</HI> and <HI>Tom&s;on,</HI> and have confirmed their Relation by their corporal Oaths? As for the Act of the five and twentieth of February, which this Authour hath here tran&s;cribed; it cannot be a true Act: for therein it is &s;aid, that that day all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were examined one by one, and &s;ome before Torture, and &s;ome after confe&s;&s;ed the Fact. Where|as it appeareth not onely by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Relation, but by this very Authour in the precedent page, that they were not all exa|mined the &s;ame five and twen|tieth day of February; but that the examination continued &s;ix dayes together, even to the third of March inclu&s;ive. How then
<PB N="55" REF="94">could the Act of the five and twentieth of February have all their confe&s;&s;ions? By this may appear, what credit may be gi|ven to the&s;e Acts, or el&s;e to this Authour. Here al&s;o by the way he tels us of the deliberation of their Councel; whether the pu|ni&s;hment of the Fact might be re&s;pited, or the cau&s;e removed: wherein it was re&s;olved, that exe|cution mu&s;t needs be done in the place of the delict, for example &s;ake; and might not be re&s;pited, for fear le&s;t the Con&s;piratours (as he tearms them) might have more Dependances than yet were known; and in particular, the <HI>Ternatans</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Amboyna.</HI> A poor pretext: as if, having all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in Irons aboard their &s;everal &s;hips, they &s;hould need to fear their joyning with the <HI>Ternatans.</HI> But it may be, they feared &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips al&s;o to come thither: for &s;o they had made their own people believe. And therefore, two &s;hips being de&s;cried at Sea, the <HI>Dutch</HI> and their free <HI>Burghers</HI> cried out, That there were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that
<PB N="56" REF="95">&s;hould have holpen to take the Ca&s;tle: but when they arrived, they proved to be two &s;hips of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> come from <HI>Jac|catra;</HI> wherein was a Letter from the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, to call away Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> and all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from <HI>Amboyna</HI> to <HI>Jaccatra.</HI> Which Letter was opened and read by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, while our people were yet in pri&s;on, and not executed; and might well have &s;ecured him, that there was no further danger to be feared of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> aids of &s;hipping, what-ever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pri&s;oners had through Torture confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Authour comes to the &s;entence it &s;elf, tran&s;cribing out of the Acts of the ninth of March, That the Colledge of Judges being then competent, and calling upon the name of the Lord to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this mourn|full a&s;&s;embly, to pre&s;ide in their hearts, and in&s;pire them with equity and Ju&s;tice; proceeded to &s;entence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Who knoweth not, but the Act may be thus formed,
<PB N="57" REF="95">and yet no prayer at all made? or if there were any &s;uch prayer, yet the proceedings well weighed, will &s;hew it to be but like <HI>Jeza|bels</HI> Fa&s;t, the preparative to the fal&s;e judgement again&s;t <HI>Naboth.</HI> Neither will the wi&s;e and indif|ferent Judges of this whole mat|ter, conceive the better of the cau&s;e, for the Hypocritical forma|lities therein ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, he concludes his treati&s;e with a ju&s;tification, yea, an Elogie and commendation of the whole proceedings of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Amboyna</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h;</HI> not finding the lea&s;t to be blamed to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but aggra|vating the crime of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very ridiculou&s;ly, becau&s;e (for|&s;ooth) that this plot among&s;t o|ther things, was again&s;t the great means of the <HI>Neatherlands Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company: as if a con&s;pi|racie to rob them, (if any &s;uch had been) mu&s;t needs be Trea|&s;on, or as if the intent onely in any Crime but trea&s;on, were Capital.</P>
<P>Thus have we examined this &s;trained ju&s;tification of that mo&s;t

<PB N="4" REF="98">him, the behaviour that he u&s;ed, being no other than what may be u&s;ed by any Souldier in the place where he &s;erveth, other <HI>indicia</HI> there were none in the lea&s;t, neither of provi&s;ions of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for &s;uch an attempt, nor of corre&s;pondencies to that purpo&s;e, nor any other agreeing with the rules and examples given by the law or its expounders. Be&s;ides, it is not enough for to take a confe&s;&s;ion upon the Rack, God having not &s;ent all men courage of bodies to endure high tortures (as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Collins, Beamont, Sherrock</NOTE> &s;ome in this tragedie, wea|ried with &s;uffering, bade them propo&s;e what they would have them confe&s;s) but it is by Law required, that they &s;hould be iterated
<PB N="5" REF="98">and confirmed &s;ome days after, when the pain of the partie is over, and no fur|ther torment offered unto him. Now in this ca&s;e, there is never a confe&s;&s;ion entered in the Acts of the Council of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> but it is forced from the parties them&s;elves by un&s;upporta|ble tortures, not one witne&s;s being either examined or depo&s;ed. Withall, if there had been as much guilt a|mong the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as is &s;u&s;|pected, why did none of them attempt, either to tran&s;port them&s;elves in the Curricurries, and other ve&s;&s;els, that then departed as freely from <HI>Amboyna</HI> as at other times, as it was no hard matter, or &s;eek to hide them&s;elves? a guiltie con&s;ci|ence
<PB N="6" REF="99">being the in&s;ecure&s;t thing in the world, and the <HI>Japonne&s;&s;es</HI> being at that time at the torture.</P>
<P>Thus much for the pro|babilitie of this dangerous machination; now for the le|gallitie of the proceeding of the <HI>Dutch</HI> thereupon, we will &s;it down and con&s;ider. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were tortured, were &s;ubject to an ab&s;olute Prince, independent of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> but in league with them: &s;o they were friends and companions to the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> and not &s;ubjects, and were to be governed by their own Laws, or in ca&s;e an offence given to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a joynt Compa|nie of both Nations. But the Governour of <HI>Amboy|na,</HI> took juri&s;diction over
<PB N="7" REF="99">them, and therefore the whole proceeding had been illegal, had it been as gen|tle as it was cruel. Nor is it enough to &s;ay, that the &s;ub|jects of another Countrey, offending again&s;t a Forreign juri&s;diction (under which they are at pre&s;ent) ought to be puni&s;hed by tho&s;e Laws, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had an intere&s;t and &s;hare in the place, and there were, as I &s;aid before, as <HI>&s;ocii,</HI> not as <HI>&s;ubditi:</HI> not to &s;ay that there was no offence at all, &s;o that the ground of the Objecti|on is taken away. Nay, &s;uppo&s;e that we had been under their juri&s;diction, yet were the proceedings ab&s;o|lutely illegal: For they &s;hould have been agreeable to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="100">which tho&s;e were not, and therefore it was an offence in the Governour, and a high one again&s;t the laws of his own Countrey. For all penal Laws, &s;trictly circum&s;tantiate, as well for executing ju&s;t rigour, as for preventing of crueltie; and every Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice that tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth herein, as if he behead a man that is adjudged to be hanged, he renders him&s;elf little better than in the &s;ame capacitie. Yet notwith&s;tanding, there was no ju&s;t <HI>indicium</HI> for the torturing of the fir&s;t <HI>Japan,</HI> nor any proofs again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but forced confe&s;&s;i|ons of tho&s;e tortured wret|ches, which for the mo&s;t part were directed by the <HI>Dutch, in his verbis:</HI> which
<PB N="9" REF="100">ground of Torture is pro|hibited by their own Law.</P>
<P>For matter of Torture, if you have had the heart to &s;urvay it, I &s;uppo&s;e you will think it needs neither heightning, nor &s;hadowing, it is &s;o foul of it &s;elf. For my part all the debauched cruelties of the fir&s;t Ro|mane Emperours, when the invention of a good exqui|&s;ite Torment was a good way for advancement, though &s;avage devices in|flicted upon the Martyrs, when the continuance of per&s;ecution hardened and in&s;tructed cruelty; all tho&s;e &s;anguinarie Barbari&s;ms of the mo&s;t unciviliz'd Na|tions have not appeared to me &s;o foul and exqui&s;ite as this &s;ingle proce&s;s; and that
<PB N="10" REF="101">by a people in league with us, of opinion with us in Re|ligion, and obliged to us in effect for their being, pur|cha&s;ed by us with the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave lives, and the profu&s;ion of &s;o much trea&s;ure, even in our own mo&s;t dangerous times, when they were like to be &s;wallowed up by a ravenous invader, and &s;tood de&s;erted by all their other neigh|bours; yet the&s;e men for the engro&s;&s;ing of that Trade, wherein they have been unhappily fortunate, could cancel all the&s;e obli|gations, and break the Laws of nature, nations, and ho&s;|pitality to bring it about.</P>
<P>And truly me thinks up|on this occa&s;ion, I cannot but look back on the feli|city
<PB N="11" REF="101">of tho&s;e times, the ex|cellencie of the Govern|ment, and the Honour of that Prince that could &s;leep &s;o &s;oundly, when &s;uch cries were &s;o loud in his ears. This it is to be under the Government of <HI>one,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding is govern|ed by a <HI>Pimp</HI> or a <HI>Para&s;ite,</HI> who though he have &s;uch a &s;acred tru&s;t as the &s;afety and the righting of the peo|ple, yet to plea&s;e his <HI>Cate|mit,e</HI> and the better to &s;acri|fice to his lu&s;t and luxurie, would be blind to &s;uch a violation of his own Ho|nour, and the &s;afety of his people, while the bloud cries in vain behind the Al|tar, and &s;o becomes entayl'd on his own head, and for ought we know, may &s;till lie
<PB N="12" REF="102">upon ours. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> knew well enough what an ea&s;ie and &s;ecure Prince they had to deal with, and there|fore like crafty Foxes ad|ventured to play tricks with the old drow&s;ie Lion; they knew well enough that the exorbitancies, prodigalities, and ill provi&s;ions of that Court would ever keep it beggarly and needy, and that there wanted not in|&s;truments in it that Gold would work upon: and therefore they had old <HI>Jammy</HI> fa&s;t enough be&s;ieg'd (though he were a place ea&s;ie enough to take in of him&s;elf) &s;o that this bu&s;i|ne&s;s was hu&s;hed up in &s;i|lence for a little money, and the cautionarie Towns were &s;old for <HI>nine pence,</HI> which
<PB N="13" REF="102">had co&s;t us a <HI>Noble,</HI> they them&s;elves laughing at the credulitie of that &s;tupid Prince, that would give up &s;o con&s;iderable places (which held them in aw, and pre&s;erved us ever a good means to right our &s;elves) and thinking &s;o great a ma|&s;ter-piece, that their engine, the <HI>then</HI> Secretarie, had a pre&s;ent of no le&s;s than 30. or 40000. <HI>l.</HI> for that one &s;ervice. But the be&s;t of it is, the enchantment is now broke up, and we begin to rou&s;e our &s;elves again, and with the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our Liberty, may ar|rive at a higher pitch of glorie and happine&s;s than any of our Ance&s;tors? if they, that have overcome, &s;heath their &s;words (as God
<PB N="14" REF="103">be thanked they do) and they that are overcome lay a&s;ide their hates, as I wi&s;h they may. For &s;o we &s;hall grow up to be one body, and &s;hall be formidable to all round about us, and be able rather to right our di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Neighbours, than be in a capacity to receive injuries of the lea&s;t, much le&s;s of the mo&s;t horrid na|ture.</P>
