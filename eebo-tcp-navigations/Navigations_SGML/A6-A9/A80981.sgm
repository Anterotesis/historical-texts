</FIGURE> &leaf; By the Protector. A PROCLAMATION Declaring the right of the FELLOWSHIP and COMPANY of Engli&s;h Merchants for Di&s;co|very of New Trades (commonly called the <HI>Mu&s;covia Company</HI>) to the &s;ole Fi&s;hing for Whales upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Green-land</HI> and <HI>Chery-I&s;land,</HI> and for re&s;training and prohibiting of all others.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_WHEREAS</HI> the Di&s;covery of the I&s;land called <HI>Chery-I&s;land,</HI> and the Conti|nent of <HI>Green-land,</HI> with the fi&s;hing for <HI>Whales</HI> upon the Seas and Coa&s;ts thereof, and of the I&s;lands and places thereto adjacent (having been made by the Fellow&s;hip of Engli&s;h Merchants, for Di&s;covery of New Trades commonly called the <HI>Mu&s;covia Company,</HI> and at their own great charges and hazards) hath by experience been found to be, and is a very great honour and advantage to this Nation and Commonwealth, a&s;wel in the inlargement of the Dominions and Territories thereof, as al&s;o in the advancement and increa&s;e of Navigation, and the entring upon and gaining of the Trade of Whale-fi&s;hing, whereby great quantities of Whale-Oyl, Whale-Fins and other Commodities are yearly hither imported, to the enriching of this Na|tion, without the Exportation of any Commodities from hence: And whereas upon con&s;ideration of the Premi&s;es, and for recompence of the &s;aid charge and hazards in the &s;aid Di&s;covery, and for the encouragement of the &s;aid Company and others in time to come, &s;everal Grants and Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> have been heretofore made and granted to the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip, and particularly in the Raign of the late King <HI>Philip</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by which all main Lands, I&s;les, Havens, Ports, Creeks and Rivers, by the &s;aid Company then di&s;covered or to be after di&s;covered, were forbidden to be traffiqued unto, or vi&s;ited by any the People of this Nation, without the Licen&s;e of the &s;aid Company; Which Letters Patents were afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament in the Eighth year of the Raign of the late Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> under the penalty of forfeiting the Ships and Goods of any Trading thither without Licen&s;e, and with addition of divers other Priviledges and Liberties unto the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip and Company. And the late King <HI>James,</HI> for the further encouragement of the &s;aid Company, and preventing others to interrupt, di&s;tract or di&s;turb their &s;aid Trade-fi&s;hing and Di&s;coveries, did, in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid Act of Parlia|ment, and the true intent and meaning of the &s;ame, by his Letters Patents grant unto the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip, the &s;ole Trading and Fi&s;hing in tho&s;e Seas and places &s;o di&s;covered by them, And all others were forbidden to fi&s;h in tho&s;e Seas and Coa&s;ts, or to &s;ail thither for Trade without Li|cen&s;e of the &s;aid Company. Notwith&s;tanding which, the &s;aid Company as We are given to under|&s;tand, have of late received &s;ome di&s;turbance by the interloping and intruding of &s;ome per&s;ons into the &s;aid Whale-fi&s;hing, upon tho&s;e Seas and Coa&s;ts of <HI>Green-land</HI> and <HI>Chery-I&s;land,</HI> whereupon the &s;aid Company having addre&s;&s;ed their humble Petition unto Vs. And the matter having been by Vs re|ferred to the con&s;ideration of our Privy Council, and fully heard and debated before a Committee of Our &s;aid Council, as well on behalf of the &s;aid particular Traders, as al&s;o on behalf of the &s;aid Fel|low&s;hip and Company. And the Act of Parliament and the Grants and Charters made to the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip and Company &s;hewed forth and read, and the whole matter having been fully con&s;idered, and thereupon made evident, that &s;uch particular fi&s;hing for Whales upon tho&s;e Seas, Harbours and Coa&s;ts, by per&s;ons &s;eparate from the &s;aid Company, and trading therein by them&s;elves apart, with like power and &s;trength, did not onely di&s;turb the main Trade of Fi&s;hing and taking of Whales by the Company, but did tend to the ruine and de&s;truction of that Fi&s;hing, and unle&s;s prevented, might oc|ca&s;ion Forraigners to come in and gain away that fi&s;hing and Trading from this Nation, which might tend to the great damage and di&s;honour of Vs and this Nation, be&s;ides the particular damage of the &s;aid Company. And whereas the whole &s;tate of the matter having been again repre&s;ented to Our &s;aid Privy Council and by them al&s;o fully con&s;idered, it was by them conceived to be for the good of this Nation, to encourage the carrying on of the &s;aid Whale-fi&s;hing and Trade, by the &s;aid Fel|lo&s;hwip and Company onely, and to forbid all others, except &s;uch as the &s;aid Company &s;hould Licen&s;e, to intrude or meddle therein. And the &s;aid Company having further declared, that they appropria|ting tho&s;e parts of the &s;aid Seas called <HI>Bell Sound,</HI> and <HI>Horn Sound,</HI> with &s;uch other places as they &s;hall fi&s;h in, to them&s;elves onely, were well contented, and do promi&s;e to grant Licen&s;es <HI>gratis</HI> to all and e|very per&s;on of this Nation and Commonwealth, that &s;hall or will but ask or de&s;ire to fi&s;h for Whales, or Trade in any other of the &s;aid Seas, or Coa&s;ts of <HI>Green-land,</HI> or <HI>Chery-I&s;land,</HI> where they them&s;elves fi&s;h not. We therefore taking the Premi&s;es into Our con&s;ideration (with the advice of
