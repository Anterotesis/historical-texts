<P>There is a Root common in the Woods called <HI>Tuckaho,</HI> the Natives eat it for bread; our Swine eat it; with Acorns and Nuts of all &s;orts, they are Fat; and is the &s;weete&s;t Bacon that ever man ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The planters feed not their Swine nor Cattle, but kill them fat out of the Woods.</P>
<P>There is Fullers-Earth, Marle, Salt-peter, Iron, Stone, Lead, Tin and Silver Oar.</P>
<P>There is plenty of Engli&s;h graine, as Wheat, Barley, Beanes, Peas and Oats.</P>
<P>The ground is very fruitful, and produceth plentiful Crops with great &s;peed, what ever is planted or Sown; as for example, one careful laborious man will plant, tend, and get in 50. barrels of Indian Wheat, without the help of Man, Hor&s;e or Oxe; each barrel is five Engli&s;h bu&s;hels. And if the &s;tone or &s;ee of any fruit be &s;own, it will bear the third year without graft|ing; each Planter makes great Crops of To|bacco; the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> limits of the Land are un|known In <HI>Mary-Land;</HI> their Religion is free to all that profe&s;s to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
