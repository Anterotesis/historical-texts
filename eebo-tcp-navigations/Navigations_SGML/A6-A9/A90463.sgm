<P N="37">37 Vines in abundance and variety, do grow naturally over all the land, but by the birds and bea&s;ts, mo&s;t devoured before they come to perfection and ripene&s;&s;e; but this te&s;tifies and declares, That the Ground, and the Climate is mo&s;t proper, and the Com|modity of Wine is not a contemptible Merchandize; but &s;ome men of worth &amp; e&s;tate mu&s;t give in the&s;e things example to the in|feriour inhabitants and ordinary &s;ort of men, to &s;hew them the gain and Commodity by it, which they will not believe but by ex|perience before their faces: And in Tobacco they can make 20. <HI>l. &s;terling</HI> a man. at 3^d a pound <HI>per annum;</HI> and this they find and know and the pre&s;ent gain is that, that puts out all endeavours from the attempting of others more Staple, and Sollid, and rich Commodities, out of the heads and hands of the Common people: So as I &s;ay, the wealthier &s;ort of men mu&s;t begin and give the ex|ample, and make the gain of other Commodities as apparent to them, by the effecting them to perfection, or it will not (as it hath not hither unto) go forward.</P>
<P N="38">38 That they have health very well, and fewer die in a yeer there, according to the proportion, then in any place of <HI>England;</HI> &s;ince that men are provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, have plenty of vi|ctual bread, and good beer, and hou&s;eing, all which the Engli&s;h|men loves full dearly.</P>

<P N="48">48 That for matter of their better knowledge of the Land they dwell in, the Planters re&s;olve to make a further Di&s;covery into the Country We&s;t and by South up above the Fall and over the Hills, and are confident upon what they have learned from the <HI>Indians,</HI> to find away to a We&s;t or South Sea by land or rivers, &amp; to di&s;co|ver a way to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> or unto &s;ome other Sea that &s;hal carry them thither; For Sir <HI>Francis Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ke</HI> was on the back &s;ide of <HI>Virginia</HI> in his voyage about the world in 37 degrees ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and called <HI>Nova Albion,</HI> and by the Natives kind|ly u&s;ed: And now all the que&s;tion is only how broad the Land may be to that place from the head of <HI>James</HI> River above the Falls, but all men conclude if it be not narrow, yet that there is and will be found the like rivers i&s;&s;uing into a South Sea or a We&s;t Sea on the other &s;ide of tho&s;e Hills, as there is on this &s;ide when they run from the We&s;t down into a Ea&s;t Sea after a cour&s;e of 150 miles: but of this certainty M. <HI>Hen.

<P>And the <HI>Indians</HI> have of late acquainted our Governour, that within five dayes journey to the We&s;tward and by South, there is

<P>The Governor <HI>Sir William,</HI> cau&s;ed half a bu&s;hel of Rice (which he had procured) to be &s;owen, and it pro&s;pered gallantly, and he had fifteen bu&s;hhels of it, excellent good Rice, &s;o that all the&s;e fif|teen bu&s;hels will be &s;owen again this yeer; and we doubt not in a &s;hort time to have Rice &s;o plentiful as to afford it at 2^d a pound if not cheaper, for we perceive the ground and Climate is very pro|per for it as our <HI>Negroes</HI> affirme, which in their Country is mo&s;t of their food, and very healthful for our bodies.</P>
<P>We have many thou&s;and of Acres of cleer Land, I mean where the wood is all off it (for you mu&s;t know all <HI>Virginia</HI> is full of trees) and we have now going neer upon a hundred and fifty Plowes, with many brave yoak of Oxen, and we &s;owe excellent Wheat, Barley, Rye, Beans, Pea&s;e, Oates; and our increa&s;e is wonderful, and better Grain not in tne world.</P>

<P>VVe have mo&s;t rare coloured Parraketoes, and one Bird we call the Mock-bird; for he will imitate all other Birds notes, and cries both day and night-birds, yea, the Owles and Night|ingalls.</P>
