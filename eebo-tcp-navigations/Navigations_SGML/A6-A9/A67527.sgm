<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Condition of an <HI>Author</HI> is much like that of a <HI>Strumpet,</HI> both exposing our <HI>Reputations</HI> to sup|ply our <HI>Necessities,</HI> till at last we contract such an ill habit, thro' our Practices, that we are equally troubl'd with an <HI>Iteh</HI> to be alwas <HI>Doing</HI>; and if the reason be requir'd, Why we be|take our selves to so Scandalous a Profession as <HI>Whoring</HI> or <HI>Pamphleteering,</HI> the same excvsive Answer will serve us both, <HI>viz.</HI> That the unhappy circumstances of a Narrow Fortune, hath forc'd us to do that for our Subsistance, which we are much asham'd of.</P>
<P>The chiefest and most commendable Tallent, admir'd in either, is the knack of Pleasing; and He or She amongst us that hap|pily arives to a Perfection in that sort of Witchcraft, may in a little time (to their great Honour) enjoy the Pleasure of being Celebrated by all the <HI>Coxcombs</HI> in the Nation.</P>
<P>The only difference between us is, in this perticular, where in the <HI>Jilt</HI> has the Advantage, we do our Business First, and stand to the Courtesie of our Benefactors to Reward us after; whilst the other, for her Security, makes her <HI>Rider</HI> pay for his <HI>Journey,</HI> before he mounts the <HI>Saddle.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3" MS="y">It is necessary I should say something in relation to the following Matter: I do not therein present you with a formal <HI>Journal</HI> of my Voyage, or <HI>Geographical</HI> Description of the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for that has been already done by Persons better Quallifi'd for such a Task. I only Entertain you with what I intend for your <HI>Diversion,</HI> not <HI>Instruction</HI>; Digest|ed into such a Stile as might move your <HI>Laughter,</HI> not merit your <HI>Esteem.</HI> I quistion not but the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Coffee-House will be much affronted at my <HI>Character</HI> of their <HI>Sweeting Chaos,</HI> and if I was but as well assur'd of Pleasing every body else, as I am of Displeasing those who have an Interest in that Country, I should not question but the <HI>Printer</HI> would gain his End, which are the wishes of the <HI>Author.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A TRIP TO JAMAICA:</HEAD>
<P>_IN the times of <HI>Adversity</HI> when <HI>Poverty</HI> was held no <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> no <HI>Virtue</HI>; When <HI>Honesty</HI> in a Tradesman's Con|science, and <HI>Money</HI> in his Counting-House were as scarce as <HI>Health</HI> in an Hospital, or <HI>Charity</HI> in a Clergyman. The <HI>Sword</HI> being advanc'd, and the <HI>Pen</HI> silenc'd; <HI>Printers</HI> being too Poor to pay down <HI>Copy-Money,</HI> and <HI>Authors</HI> too Poor to Trust 'em: <HI>Fools</HI> getting more by hazarding their <HI>Carcasses,</HI> than <HI>Ingenious Men</HI> by im|ploying their <HI>Wits</HI>; which was well enough observ'd by a Gentle|man, in these following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>When <HI>Pens</HI> were valu'd less than <HI>Swords,</HI></L>
<L>And Blows got Money more than Words;</L>
<L>When Am'rous <HI>Beaux,</HI> and Campaign <HI>Bully,</HI></L>
<L>Thriv'd by their <HI>Fighting</HI> and their <HI>Folly</HI>;</L>
<L>Whilst Men of Parts, as Poar as <HI>Rats,</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>Mourning Swords</HI> and <HI>Flapping Hats,</HI></L>
<L>Appear by Night, like <HI>Owles</HI> and <HI>Bats</HI>:</L>
<L>With Hungry hast pursuing way,</L>
<L>To Sir <HI>John Lend,</HI> or 'Squire <HI>Pay.</HI></L>
<L>Till <HI>Wit</HI> in <HI>Rags,</HI> and <HI>Fool</HI> in <HI>Feather,</HI></L>
<L>Were joyn'd, by Providence, together.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y">The one o'er Bottle breaks his Iest,</L>
<L>Like Country Parson at a Feast;</L>
<L>For which he's Treated and Exalted,</L>
<L>By his dear Friend, Sir <HI>Looby Dolthead.</HI></L>
<L>Vnhappy Age, which so in Vice surpasses,</L>
<L>That Men of Worth must Worship <HI>Golden Asses.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I being influenc'd by my Stars, with an unhappy propensity to the Conversation of those unlucky kind of <HI>Fortune-Hunters,</HI> till at last, tho' I had no more Wit to boast of than another Man, yet I shar'd the Fate of those that had; and to bear them Com|pany, stragled so far from the Paths of <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Preferment,</HI> into a Wilderness of <HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Enjoyment,</HI> that I had like to have been stuck fast in a Thicket of Brambles, before I knew were abouts I was; to clear my self of which, I bustled like a <HI>Fox</HI> in a <HI>Gin,</HI> or a <HI>Hare</HI> in a <HI>Patridge-Net</HI>: But before I could free my self from this Entanglement, I had so wounded my Feet, and stuck so many Thorns in my Side, that I halted homewards like a <HI>Gouty Puritan</HI> to an <HI>Election,</HI> or a <HI>Lame Begger</HI> to a <HI>Misers Funeral.</HI></P>
<P>These little Afflictions mov'd me to reflect upon my Mis-pent Time; and like a <HI>Thief</HI> in a <HI>Goal,</HI> or a <HI>Whore</HI> in a <HI>Flux,</HI> I Resolv'd for the future to Reform my Life, change my Measures, and push my self upon something that might recover those lost Moments, I had hitherto converted to the use of others, and not my self. I now began to peep into the <HI>Business</HI> of the World, and chang'd the Company of those who had nothing to do but <HI>Spend Money,</HI> for the Conversation of such whose practice was to <HI>Get it.</HI></P>
<P>But I, thro' Inadvertency, neglecting to consult Doctor <HI>Troter,</HI> or some other Infallible Predicting Wisaker, began my Reformation in an unfortunate Minute, when <HI>Vserers</HI> were unbinding their <HI>Fetter'd Trunks,</HI> and breaking up their <HI>Deified Bags</HI> and <HI>Consecrated Sums,</HI> for the security of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the further establishment of <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> without which [<HI>Liberty</HI>] join'd, <HI>Conscience</HI> to them would be of no use. <HI>Tradesmen</HI> grumbling at the <HI>Taxes, Merchants</HI> at their <HI>Losses,</HI> most Men complaining for want of <HI>Business,</HI> and all Men in <HI>Business,</HI> for want of <HI>Money</HI>: Every Man upon <HI>Change</HI> look|ing with as peevish a Countenance, as if he had unluckily stumbled upon his <HI>Wife's Failings,</HI> and unhappily become a witness to his own <HI>Cuckoldome.</HI> These I thought but slender Encouragments to a <HI>New Reformist,</HI> who had forsaken <HI>Liberty</HI> for <HI>Restraint, Ease</HI> for <HI>Trouble Laziness</HI> for <HI>Industry, Wine</HI> for <HI>Coffee,</HI> and the <HI>Pleasures</HI> of <HI>Witty Con|versation,</HI> for the <HI>Plagues</HI> of a <HI>Muddy-Brain'd Society,</HI> who could talk of
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y">
nothing but <HI>Prime Cost</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> the <HI>Good Humour</HI> of their <HI>Wives,</HI> the <HI>Wittiness</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> and the <HI>Vnluckiness</HI> of their <HI>Prentices</HI>; and knew no more how <HI>Handsomly</HI> to Spend their Money, than <HI>Honestly</HI> to Get it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Complaints</HI> of these <HI>Philodenarians,</HI> the <HI>Declination</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> and the <HI>Scarcity</HI> of <HI>Money,</HI> gave me no more hopes of mending my Condition, by pursuing my intended measures, than a <HI>Good Husband</HI> has of mending a <HI>Bad Wife</HI> by winking at her <HI>Vices.</HI> I now found my self in great danger of a Relaps, to prevent which, after two or three Gallons of <HI>Derby-Ale</HI> had one day sent my <HI>Wits a Woollga|thering,</HI> and generated as many <HI>Maggots</HI> in my <HI>Brains,</HI> as there are <HI>Crotchets</HI> in the <HI>Head</HI> of a <HI>Musician,</HI> or <HI>Fools</HI> in the <HI>Million Lottery,</HI> I e'en took up a Resolution to Travel, and Court the Blinking Gipsy <HI>Fortune</HI> in another Country. I then began to Consider what Cli|mate might best suit with my <HI>Constitution,</HI> and what Part of the World with my <HI>Circumstances</HI>; and upon mature Deliberation, found a <HI>Warm Latitude</HI> would best agree with <HI>Thin Apparel,</HI> and a <HI>Money'd Country</HI> with a <HI>Narrow Fortune</HI>; and having often heard such extravagant Encomiums of that Blessed Paradise <HI>Iamaica,</HI> where <HI>Gold</HI> is more plentiful than <HI>Ice, Silver</HI> than <HI>Snow, Pearl</HI> than <HI>Hailstones,</HI> I at last determin'd to make a trial of my Stars in that <HI>Island,</HI> and see whether they had the same Unlucky Influence upon me there, as they had, hitherto, in the Land of my Nativity.</P>
<P>In order to proceed my <HI>Voyage,</HI> I took a Passage in the good Ship the <HI>Andalucia</HI>; and about the latterend of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> 1697. upon the dissolution of the hard Frost, I passed, with many others, by the Night Tide, in a <HI>Wherry,</HI> to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where our <HI>Floating Re|ceptacle</HI> lay ready to take in <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Passengers</HI>; but our Lady <HI>Thames</HI> being put into a Passion, by the rude Kisses of an <HI>Easterly Wind,</HI> drew her Smooth Face into so many Wrinckles, that her ill-favour'd Aspect and Murmurings, were to me as Terrible as the Noise of <HI>Thieves</HI> to a <HI>Miser,</HI> or <HI>Bailiffs</HI> to a <HI>Bankrupt</HI>; and being pent up with my Limbs, in an awkward Posture, lying Heads and Tails, like <HI>Essex</HI> Calves in a <HI>Rumford</HI> Waggon, I was forc'd to endure the Insolence of every Wave, till I was become as Wet as a New Pump'd <HI>Kidnapper.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition I Embark'd about Two a Clock in the Mor|ning, where the Chief Mait, as Master of the Ceremonies, condu|cted me to a wellcome Collation of <HI>Cheese</HI> and <HI>Bisket,</HI> and presen|ted me with a Magnificent <HI>Can</HI> of Soveraign <HI>Flip,</HI> prepar'd with as much Art as an <HI>Appothecary</HI> can well shew in the mixing of a <HI>Cordial.</HI> After this Refreshment, I betook my self to a <HI>Cabin,</HI> which fitted me so well, it sat as tite as a <HI>Iacket</HI> to a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> where I Slep till Morning, as close as a <HI>Snaile</HI> in a <HI>Shell,</HI> or a <HI>Maggot</HI> in an
<PB N="8" REF="5" MS="y">
<HI>Appel-Kernel.</HI> Then Rising, and after I had survey'd our Wooden Teretories, I began to Contemplate upon things worthy of a seri|ous Consideration, which stir'd up in me that Malignant Spirit of <HI>Poetry,</HI> with which I am oft times unhappily possess'd: And what my <HI>Muse</HI> dictated to me, her <HI>Emanuensis,</HI> I here present unto the <HI>Reader.</HI></P>

<P>Towards the Evening the Captain came on Board, with the rest of our Fellow-Travellours, who, when we were altogether patch'd up as pritty a Society, as a Man under my Circumstances would desire to tumble into: There was Three of the <HI>Troublesome Sex,</HI> as some call them, (tho' I never thought 'em so) whose Cur|teous Affabillity, and Complaisancy of Temper, admitted of no other Emulation, but to strive who (within the bounds of Mode|sty) should be most Obliging. One <HI>Vnfortunate Lady</HI> was in pur|sute of a <HI>Stray'd Husband,</HI> who, in <HI>Iamaica,</HI> had Feloniously taken to Wife (for the sake of a Plantation) a <HI>Lacker-Fac'd Creolean,</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="6" MS="y">
the great dissatisfaction of his Original Spouse, who had often de|clar'd (thro' the sweetness of her Disposition) That if he had Marri'd another Handsomer than her self, it would never have vex'd her; but to be Rival'd by a <HI>Gipsy,</HI> a Tawny Fac'd <HI>Moletto</HI> Strumpet, a Pump|kin colour'd Whore, no, her Honour would not suffer her to bear with patience so coroding an Indignity. The other Two were a pritty <HI>Maid,</HI> and a comly <HI>Widow</HI>; so that in these three, we had every Honourable State of the whole Sex: One in the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Innocency,</HI> another of <HI>Fruition,</HI> the third of <HI>Deprivation</HI>; and if we'd had but one in the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Corruption,</HI> a Man might have pleas'd himself as well in our <HI>Little World,</HI> as you <HI>Libertines</HI> can do in the <HI>Great One.</HI></P>
<P>I shall be too tedious if I at large Particularize the whole Com|pany, I shall therefore <HI>Hustle</HI> them together, as a <HI>Morefields Sweetener</HI> does <HI>Luck in a Bag,</HI> and then you may Wink and Choose, for the Devil a Barrel the better Herring amongst us. We had one (as I told you before) <HI>Cherubimical Lass,</HI> who, I fear, had <HI>Lost her Self,</HI> two more, of the same <HI>Gender,</HI> who had lost their <HI>Husbands</HI>; two <HI>Parsons</HI> who had lost their <HI>Livings</HI>; three <HI>Broken Tradesmen,</HI> who had lost their <HI>Credit</HI>; and several, like me that had lost their <HI>Wits</HI>; a <HI>Creolean Captain,</HI> a <HI>Super annuated Mariner,</HI> an <HI>Independant Merchant,</HI> an <HI>Irish Kidnapper,</HI> and a <HI>Monmothean Sciths-Man,</HI> all going with one De|sign, to patch up their <HI>Decay'd Fortunes.</HI></P>
<P>Every thing being in Order for <HI>Sailing,</HI> the <HI>Pilot</HI> came on <HI>Board,</HI> who put on such a Commanding Countenance, that he look'd as Stern as a <HI>Sarazins Head</HI>; and the <HI>Sins</HI> of his <HI>Youth</HI> having crep't into his <HI>Pedestals,</HI> he Limp'd about the <HI>Quarter Deck</HI>; like a <HI>Cripple</HI> in <HI>Forma Pauperis</HI> upon a <HI>Mountebanks Stage,</HI> making as great a Noise in his <HI>Tarpaulin Cant,</HI> as a <HI>Young Counsel</HI> in a <HI>Bad Cause,</HI> or a <HI>Butcher</HI> at a <HI>Bear-Garden.</HI> As soon as we had weigh'd <HI>Anchor,</HI> under the dole|ful Cry and hard Service of <HI>Haul Cat haul,</HI> there was nothing heard till we reach'd the <HI>Downs,</HI> but <HI>About Ship my Lads, bring your Fore Tack on Board, haul Fore-Sail hand, Brace about the Main-Yard,</HI> and the Devil to do, That I was more Amaz'd than a <HI>Mouse</HI> at a <HI>Throsters Mill,</HI> or the <HI>Russian Embassador</HI> at a <HI>Clap</HI> of <HI>Thunder.</HI></P>
<P>By the help of <HI>Providence,</HI> the <HI>Pilots</HI> Care, and <HI>Seamens</HI> Industry, we pass'd safe to <HI>Deal,</HI> where we Anchor'd three or four Days for a fair Wind. In which interim, the <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> had puff'd up an unwelcome Blast in the Night, which forc'd a Vessel upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI> The next Morning the <HI>Salvages</HI> Man'd out a Fleet of their <HI>Deal Skimming-dishes,</HI> and made such unmerciful work with the poor distressed <HI>Bark,</HI> that a <HI>Gang</HI> of <HI>Bailiffs</HI> with an <HI>Execution,</HI> or a <HI>Kennel</HI> of <HI>Hounds</HI> upon a <HI>Dead Horse,</HI> could not have appear'd more <HI>Ravenous.</HI> From thence, with a prosperous Gale, we made the best of our way into the wide <HI>Ocean,</HI> which <HI>Marriners</HI> say, is of such Profundity,
<PB N="11" REF="6" MS="y">
that, like a <HI>Misers Conscience,</HI> or a <HI>Womans Concupiscence</HI> 'tis never to be Fathom'd.</P>
<P>'Twas in the midst of Winter, and very Cold Weather when we set out; but in a Fortnights time we were got into a comfortable Climat, which yielded us so pleasant a warmth, than a Man might pluck of his Shirt upon Deck, and commit <HI>Murther</HI> upon his own <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> till he was weary, without the danger of an Ague.</P>
<P>I happen'd one Morning to hear two <HI>Tar-jackets</HI> in a very high Dispute; I went to them, and ask'd the reason of their Difference. <HI>Why Sir,</HI> says one, <HI>I'll tell you, there was my Master</HI> Whistlebooby, <HI>an old</HI> Boatswain <HI>in one of His</HI> Majesties <HI>Ships, who was</HI> Superhanded, <HI>and past his Labour, and the</HI> Ambaraltie Divorc'd <HI>him from his Ship, and the</HI> King <HI>allow'd him a</HI> Suspension, <HI>and this Lubberly Whelp here says I talk like a Fool; and sure I have not used the Sea this Thirty Years, but I can</HI> Argufie <HI>any thing as proper as he can.</HI></P>
<P>The chief <HI>Sports</HI> we had on Board, to pass away the tedious Hours, were <HI>Hob, Spie the Market, Shoue the Slipper, Dilly Dally</HI> and <HI>Back-Gam|mon</HI>; the Latter of which prov'd as serviceable to me, as a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Heraldry</HI> to a <HI>Gentleman Mumper,</HI> or a <HI>Pass</HI> to a <HI>Penniless Vagabond:</HI> For (like the <HI>Whore</HI> who boasted of her <HI>Industry</HI>) I us'd to make my Days Labour worth <HI>Two Shillings,</HI> or <HI>Half a Crown,</HI> at <HI>Two Pence,</HI> or a <HI>Groat</HI> a <HI>Bout.</HI> The most powerful Adversary I engag'd with, was a <HI>Parson,</HI> who, when the Bell Rung to Prayers, would start up in the middle of a Hit, desire my Patience whilst he step'd into the <HI>Great Cabin,</HI> and gave his Sinful Congregation a <HI>Dram</HI> of Evangellical <HI>Comfort,</HI> and he would wait upon me presently. But that <HI>Recreation</HI> in which we took a more peculiar delight, was the Harmony we made, by the assistance of the two <HI>Heaven-drivers,</HI> in Lyricking over some <HI>Antiquated Sonnets,</HI> and for varieties sake, now and then a <HI>Psalme,</HI> which our Canonical <HI>Vice-Whippers</HI> Sung with as Penitential a grace, as a Sorrowful Offen|der in his <HI>Last Night-Cap.</HI></P>
<P>To please my self at a Spare-Hour, I had taken with me a <HI>Flute,</HI> and there being on Board a <HI>Spannel Dog,</HI> who <HI>(Seaman like)</HI> had no great kindness for <HI>Wind Musick,</HI> for when ever he heard me <HI>Tooting,</HI> he'd be <HI>Howling,</HI> which, together, made a Noise so surprising, that it frighted away a <HI>Quotide<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">n Ague,</HI> from a Young Fellow who had been three Weeks under the hands of our Doctor.</P>
<P>One Night, after we had well Moisten'd our Drouthy Carcasses with an Exhilerating Dose of Right Honourable <HI>Punch,</HI> there arose a <HI>Storm,</HI> for which I had often wish'd, that I might not be a stranger to any Surprising Accident the Angry Elements, when at Varience, might afford me. The Heavens all round us (in as little time as a <HI>Girl</HI> might loose her <HI>Maidenhead</HI>) had put on such a Malignant Aspect,
<PB N="12" REF="7" MS="y">
as if it threaten'd our Destruction; And <HI>AEolus</HI> gave us such unmer|ciful Puffs and Whiffs, that I was fearful to stand upon the <HI>Quarter Deck,</HI> lest, before my time, I should be snatch'd up to Heaven in a Whirle-Wind. From all the Corners of the Skie their darted forth such Beams of <HI>Lightning,</HI> that I Vow and Protest the <HI>Fire-Works</HI> in St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s-<HI>Square,</HI> were no more to be compar'd to't, than a <HI>Gloworms Arse</HI> to a <HI>Cotten Candle,</HI> which were Instantly succeeded with such Vollys of <HI>Thunder,</HI> from every side, that you would have thought the <HI>Clouds</HI> had been Fortifi'd with <HI>Whole Canon,</HI> and weary of being tost about with every Wind, were Fighting their way into a Calmer Region to enjoy their Rest. Then fell such an excessive <HI>Rain,</HI> that as we had one Sea under us, we feard another had been tumbling upon our Heads; for my part, I fear'd the very <HI>Falling</HI> of the <HI>Skie,</HI> and thought of no|thing but <HI>Catching</HI> of <HI>Larks.</HI> My Spirits being a little deprest, by the apprehensions of the Danger we were under, I went down into the <HI>Gun-room</HI>; to consult my <HI>Brandy-Cask</HI> about taking of a <HI>Dram</HI>; where one of our <HI>Ladies,</HI> thro' want of better Accomodation, was forc'd to be Content with a <HI>Cradle,</HI> in which she was <HI>Praying,</HI> with as much Since|rity, for <HI>Fair Weather,</HI> as a <HI>Farmer</HI> for a <HI>Kind Harvest,</HI> or an <HI>Old Maid</HI> for a <HI>Good Husband</HI>: And I being greatly pleas'd at her most Impor|tunat Solicitations, have given you a Repetition of one part, <HI>viz. And if Thou hast Decreed, that we shall Perish in this</HI> Tempest, <HI>I most humbly beseech Thee to Punish with</HI> Pox, Barrenness, <HI>and</HI> Dry-Belly-Ach, <HI>that</HI> Adultrous Strumpet, <HI>who, by Robbing me of my</HI> Husband, <HI>hath been a means of bringing me to this Vntimely End; may her whole Life be a continued course of</HI> Sin <HI>without a moments</HI> Repentance, <HI>that she may</HI> Die <HI>without</HI> Forgiveness, <HI>and be</HI> Damn'd <HI>without</HI> Mercy. In which Interim, a Sea wash'd over our <HI>Fore-Castle,</HI> run <HI>Aft,</HI> and came down the <HI>Whip-scuttle,</HI> she conclu|ding we were going to the Bottom, Shreek'd out, and fell into a <HI>Fit</HI>; whilst I, thro my <HI>Fear,</HI> together with my <HI>Modesty,</HI> scorn'd to take the Advantage of so fair an Oppertunity.</P>
<P>In a doubtful Condition, between this World and the next, we labour'd till near Morning, about which time the Storm abated; But as soon as Day-light appear'd, and the Serenity of the Weather had turn'd our Frightful Apprehensions into a little Alacrity, some of the Men, from <HI>Aloft,</HI> espi'd a Sail bearing after us with all Expedition; and being no great distance from the Coast of <HI>Sally,</HI> a jealousie arose a|mongst our Officers, of her being a Man of War belonging to that Country, they having, upon the Conclusion of the late Peace with <HI>France,</HI> Proclaim'd a War with <HI>England</HI>; so that we thought our selves now in as great Danger of being knock'd on the Head, or made Slaves, as we were before of being Drown'd. This Alarum kindled up a|mongst us new fears of approaching Danger, more Terrible than the former we had so happily surviv'd.</P>
<P>Command was given by our Captain, to prepare for a Fight; down Chests; up Hammocks, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters">ing the small Arms upon the Quarter
<PB N="13" REF="7" MS="y">
and every Man directed to his Post, by orders fix'd upon the <HI>Mizzen-mast</HI> in the <HI>Steerage</HI>; the <HI>Bulkhead</HI> and <HI>Cabins</HI> nock'd down, the <HI>Deck</HI> clear'd <HI>Fore</HI> and <HI>Aft,</HI> for e|very Man to have free access to his Business. When all things were in readiness to receive an Enemy, I took a walk on purpose to look about me, and was so animated with the Seamens Activity and Industry, together with the smell of Sweat, Match, and Gun-powder, that like 'Squire <HI>Witherington</HI> in <HI>Chivie Chase,</HI> I could have Fought upon my Stumps. By this time our suppos'd Enemy was almost come up with us, under <HI>English</HI> Colours, but his keeping close upon our <HI>Quarter,</HI> and not bearing off, gave us still reasons to mistrust him; but seeing him a small Ship, and ours a Vessel of 400 Tuns, 28 Guns, and about 50 Men, we <HI>Furl'd</HI> our <HI>Main-Sail</HI> with all our Hands at once, as a strategem to seem well Man'd; put our <HI>Top-Sailes</HI> aback, and lay by, to let 'em see we were <HI>no more Affraid than Hurt.</HI> We had on Board an <HI>Irish-man</HI> going over a Servant, who I suppose was <HI>Kidnap'd</HI>; I observ'd this Fellow, being quarter'd at a Gun, look'd as pale as a <HI>Pickpocket</HI> new taken: I ask'd him why he put on such a <HI>Co|wardly</HI> look; and told him 'twas a shame for a Man to shew so much Fear in his Coun|tenance. <HI>Indeed Sir</HI> (said he) <HI>I cannot halp et, I love the bate of a Drum, the Pop of a Pi|stol, or the Bounch of a Mushket wall enough, but, by my Shoul, the Roaring of a Great Gun always makesh me start.</HI> I ask'd him whose Servant he was. <HI>By my Fait,</HI> said he, <HI>I cannot tell; I wash upon Change looking for a good Mashter, and a brave Gentleman came to me and ask'd me who I wash; and I told him I wash myn nown shelf, and he gave me some good Wine and good Ale, and brought me on Board, and I have not sheen him sinch.</HI> By this time our Adversary was come within hearing, and upon our Hailing of him, prov'd a little Ship bound to <HI>Guinea,</HI> which put an end to our Fears, and made us fly to the <HI>Punch-Bowl</HI> with as much Joy as the <HI>Mob</HI> to a <HI>Bonfire</HI> upon a States <HI>Holyday.</HI></P>
<P>After we had chas'd away the remembrance of our past Dangers, with a reviving draught of our Infallable Elixir, we began to be <HI>Merry</HI> as so many <HI>Beggars</HI> (and indeed were before as <HI>Poor</HI>) beginning to turn that into Redicule, which so lately had chang'd our Jollitry into Fear and Sadness. When we had thus refresh'd our Bodies, and strengthen'd our Spirits, by passing round a Health to our Noble Selves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'twas thought high time by our Reverend Pastors, to return Thanks for our great Deli|verance from the hands of our Enemies, tho' we had none near us, which was accor|dingly perform'd with all the Solemnity a parcel of <HI>Merry Iuvenal</HI> Wags could compose themselves to observe.</P>
<P>By this time we were got into so warm a Latitude, that (God be thanked) a <HI>Louse</HI> would not live in it. We now began to thin our Dress, and, had not Decency forbid it, could have gladly gone Naked, as our first Parents. Kissing here grew out of Fashion; there's no joyning of Lips, but your Noses would drop Sweat in your Mouths. The Sea, and other Elements, began now to entertain us with Curiossities in Nature worth observing, as <HI>Crampos, Sharks, Porpus, Flying-Fish, Albacores, Bonettas, Dolphin, Bottlenoses, Turtle, Blubber, Stingrays, Sea-Adders,</HI> and the Devil and all of <HI>Mon|sters</HI> without Names, and some without Shape. As for Birds, <HI>Noddys, Boobies, Shear|waters, Shags, Pitternells, Men of War, Tropick Birds, Pellicans,</HI> &amp;c. I shall not under|take here to describe these Creatures, because some of them are so Frightfully Ugly, that if any Friends Wife with Child should long for the Reading of my Book, it should chance to make her Miscarry. But that which I thought most worthy of Observation, were the <HI>Clouds,</HI> whose various Forms, and beauteous Colours, were Inimitable by the Pencil of the greatest Artist in the Univers, <HI>Cities, Palaces, Groves, Fields,</HI> and <HI>Gardens; Monuments, Castles, Armies, Bulls, Bears,</HI> and <HI>Dragons,</HI> &amp;c. as if the Air above us had been Frozen into a <HI>Looking-Glass,</HI> and shew'd us by Reflection, all the Rarities in Nature.</P>
<P>By this time we had gain'd the Tropick, and come into a Trade-Wind; the grea|tist of our fears being now a <HI>Calm,</HI> which is fine weather to please fearful Tempers; but it brings us more in danger of being <HI>Starv'd,</HI> than a <HI>Storm</HI> does of being <HI>Drown'd</HI>: Tho' it was our Fortune in a few Days after, to make the <HI>Leward-Islands,</HI> and put us
<PB N="14" REF="8" MS="y">
past the dread of so terrible a <HI>Catastrophe,</HI> those we pas'd in sight of were, <HI>Des<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ado,</HI> a rare place for a Bird-catcher to be Governour of, Birds being the only Creatures by which 'tis Inhabited; <HI>Mountserat, Antego, Mevis,</HI> possess'd by the <HI>English</HI>; St. <HI>Christo|phers,</HI> by half <HI>English</HI> half <HI>French; Rodunda,</HI> an uninhabitable high Rock. From amongst these <HI>Caribbe</HI> Islands, in a few days, we got to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> without any thing remarkable; and from thence, in 24 Hours, with a fresh Gail, within sight of <HI>Iamaica,</HI> which (without Malice or Partiallity) I shall proceed to give you some Ac|count of.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Charactor of <HI>JAMAICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Dunghill of the Universe, the Refuse of the whole Creation, the Clippings of the Elements, a shapeless pile of Rubbish confus'ly jumbl'd into an Emblem of the <HI>Chaos,</HI> neglected by Omnipotence when he form'd the World into its admirable Or|der. The Nursery of Heavens Judgments, where the Malignant Seeds of all Pesti|lence were first gather'd and scatter'd thro' the Regions of the Earth, to Punnish Mankind for their Offences. The Place where <HI>Pandora</HI> fill'd her Box, where <HI>Vulcan</HI> Forg'd <HI>Ioves</HI> Thunder-bolts, and that <HI>Phaeton,</HI> by his rash misguidance of the Sun, scorch'd into a Cinder. The Receptacle of Vagabonds, the Sanctuary of Bankrupts, and a Close-stool for the Purges of our Prisons. As Sickly as an Hospital, as Dan|gerous as the Plague, as Hot as Hell, and as Wicked as the Devil. Subject to Tur|nadoes, Hurricans, and Earthquakes, as if the Island, like the People, were troubled with the <HI>Dry Belly-Ach.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Provisions.</HEAD>
<P>THE chiefest of their Provisions is <HI>Sea Turtle,</HI> or <HI>Toad in a shell,</HI> Stew'd in its own Gravy; its Lean is as White as a Green-sickness Girl, its Fat of a Calves-turd Colour; and is excellently good to put a stranger into a Flux, and purge out part of those in Humours it infallibly creates. The Belly is call'd <HI>Callipee,</HI> the Back <HI>Callipach</HI>; and is serv'd up to the Table in its own Shell, instead of a Platter. They have <HI>Cuanas, Hickeries,</HI> and <HI>Crabs</HI>; the first being an Amphibeous <HI>Serpent,</HI> shap'd like a <HI>Lizard,</HI> but black and larger, the second a <HI>Land-Tortoise,</HI> the last needs no Discription, but are as numerous as <HI>Frogs</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and Borrough in the Ground like <HI>Rabbets,</HI> so that the whole <HI>Island</HI> may be justly call'd, <HI>A Crab-Warren.</HI> They are Fattest near the <HI>Pallasadoes,</HI> where they will make a Skelliton of a Corps in as little time as a <HI>Tanner</HI> will Flea a <HI>Colt,</HI> or a <HI>Hound</HI> after Hunting devour a <HI>Shoulder of Mutton.</HI> They have <HI>Beef</HI> without Fat, Lean <HI>Mutton</HI> without Gravy, and <HI>Fowles</HI> as dry as the Udder of an Old Woman, and as tough as a Stake from the Haunches of a Superanuated <HI>Car-Horse.</HI></P>
<P>Milk is so plenty you may buy it for Fifteen Pence a Quart; but Cream so very scarce, that a Firkin of Butter, of their own making, would be so costly a Jewel, that the Richest Man in the Island would be unable to purchase it. They value themselves greatly upon the sweetness of their Pork, which is indeed lushious, but as flabby as the Flesh of one just risen from a Flux, and ought to be forbid in all hot Countries (as amongst the <HI>Iews</HI>) for the prevention of <HI>Leprosie, Scurvy,</HI> and other Distempers, of which it is a great occasion.</P>
<P>There is very little Veal, and that Lean; for in <HI>England</HI> you may Nurse four <HI>Chil|dren</HI> much cheaper than you can one <HI>Calf</HI> in <HI>Iamaica.</HI> They have course <HI>Teal,</HI> almost as big as <HI>English Ducks</HI>; and <HI>Moscovy Ducks</HI> as big as <HI>Geese</HI>; But as for their <HI>Geese,</HI> they may be all <HI>Swans,</HI> for I never see one in the Island.</P>
<P>There are sundry sorts of <HI>Fish,</HI> under <HI>Indian</HI> Names, without Scales, and of a <HI>Ser|pentine Complection</HI>; they Eate as dry as a <HI>Shad,</HI> and much stronger than stale <HI>Herrings</HI> or <HI>Old Ling</HI>; with Oyl'd <HI>Butter</HI> to the Sause as rank as <HI>Goose-grease,</HI> improv'd with the palatable Relish of a stinking <HI>Anchove.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="8" MS="y">They make a rare <HI>Soop</HI> they call <HI>Pepper-pot</HI>; its an excellent Breakfast for a <HI>Salaman|der,</HI> or a good preparative for a <HI>Mountebanks Agent,</HI> who Eats Fire one day, that he may get better Victuals the next. Three Spoonfuls so Inflam'd my Mouth, that had I devour'd a Peck of <HI>Horse-Radish,</HI> and Drank after it a Gallon of <HI>Brandy</HI> and <HI>Gunpou|der,</HI> (<HI>Dives</HI> like) I could not have been more importunate for a Drop of Water to coole my Tongue.</P>
<P>They greatly abound in a Beautiful Fruit, call'd, a <HI>Cussue,</HI> not unlike an <HI>Apple,</HI> but longer; its soft and very Juicy, but so great an Acid, and of a Nature so Restrin|gent, that by Eating of one, it drew up my Mouth like a <HI>Hens Fundament,</HI> and made my Palate as Rough, and Tongue as Sore as if I had been Gargling it with <HI>Alum-Water</HI>: From whence I conjecture, they are a much fitter Fruit to recover <HI>Lost Maiden|beads,</HI> properly apply'd, than to be Eaten. Of <HI>Water-Mellons</HI> and <HI>Mus-Mellons</HI> they have plenty; the former is of as cold a quality as a <HI>Coucumer,</HI> and will dissolve in your <HI>Mouth</HI> like <HI>Ice</HI> in a hot <HI>Frying-pan,</HI> being as <HI>Pleasant</HI> to the <HI>Eater</HI> (and, I believe, as <HI>Wholsom</HI>) as a <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Rock-Water</HI> to a Man in a <HI>Hectick Feavour</HI>: The latter are larg and lushious, but much too watery to be good.</P>
<P><HI>Coco-Nuts,</HI> and <HI>Physick-Nuts</HI> are in great esteem amongst the Inhabitants; the former they reckon <HI>Meat, Drink,</HI> and <HI>Cloth,</HI> but the Eatable part is secur'd within so strong a Magazeen, that it requires a lusty <HI>Carpenter,</HI> well Arm'd with <HI>Ax</HI> and <HI>Hand|saw,</HI> to hew a passage to the <HI>Kernel,</HI> and when he has done, it will not recompence his Labour. The latter is big as a <HI>Filbert,</HI> but (like a <HI>Beautiful Woman</HI> well Drest, and <HI>Infectious</HI>) if you venture to Tast, is of ill consequence: Their Shell is Black, and <HI>Iapan'd</HI> by Nature, exceeding Art; the Kernel White, and extream Pleasant to the Palat, but of so powerful an Operation, that by taking two, my Guts were Swep as clean, as ever <HI>Tom-T&mdash;d-man</HI> made a <HI>Vault,</HI> or any of the <HI>Black Fraternity</HI> a <HI>Chimney.</HI></P>
<P>They have <HI>Oranges, Lemons, Limes,</HI> and several other Fruits, as <HI>Sharp</HI> and <HI>Crabbed</HI> as themselves, not given them as a <HI>Blessing,</HI> but a <HI>Curse</HI>; for Eating so many sower things, Generates a <HI>Corroding Slime</HI> in the Bowels, and is one great occasion of that Fatal and Intolerable Distemper, <HI>The Dry Belly-Ach</HI>; which in a Fortnight, or Three Weeks, takes away the use of their Limbs, that they are forc'd to be led about by <HI>Negro's.</HI> A Man under this Misery, may be said to be the <HI>Scutchion</HI> of the <HI>Island,</HI> the Complection of the Patient being the <HI>Field,</HI> bearing <HI>Of,</HI> Charg'd with all the Emblems of Destruction, <HI>proper</HI>; supported by <HI>Two Devils, Sable</HI>; and <HI>Death</HI> the <HI>Crest, Argent.</HI> Many other Fruits there are, that are neither worth Eating, Naming, or Describing: Some that are never Tasted but in a <HI>Drouth,</HI> and others in a <HI>Famin.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>Port Royal.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is an Island distinct from the Main of <HI>Iamaica,</HI> tho' before the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> it joyn'd by a Neck of Land to the <HI>Palisados,</HI> but was seperated by the violence of an Inundation (thro' God's Mercy) to prevent the Wickedness of their Metropolis defusing it self, by Communication, over all the Parts of the Country, and so call that Judgment upon the Whole, which fell more perticularly upon the Sinfulest part.</P>
<P>From a Spaceous fine Built Town (according to Report) it is now reduc'd, by the encroachments of the Sea, to a little above a quarter of a Mile in Length, and about half so much the Breadth, having so few remains left of its former splendour, I could think no otherwise, but that every Travellour who had given its Descrip|tion, made large use of his <HI>License.</HI> The Houses are low, little, and irregular; and if I compare the Best of their Streets in <HI>Port Royal,</HI> to the Fag-End of <HI>Kent|street,</HI> where the <HI>Broom-men</HI> Live, I do them more than Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="9">About Ten a Clock in the Morning, their Nostills are saluted with a <HI>Land-Breeze,</HI> which Blowing o'er the Island, searches the Bowels of the Mountains (being always crack'd and full of vents, by reason of excessive Heat) bringing along with it such <HI>Sulphorous Vapours,</HI> that I have fear'd the whole Island would have burst out into a Flaming <HI>AEtna,</HI> or have stiffled us with Suffocating Fumes, like that of melted Minerals and Brimstone.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, about Four a Clock, they might have the refreshment of a <HI>Sea-Breeze,</HI> but suffering the <HI>Negros</HI> to carry all their <HI>Nastiness</HI> to <HI>Windward</HI> of the Town, that the Nauseous Efluvias which arise from their stinking Dunghills, are blown in upon them thus what they might enjoy is a Blessing, they Ingratefully pervert by their own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>

<P>Every thing is very Dear, and an Ingenious or an Honest Man may meet with this Encouragement, To spend a Hundred Pounds before he shall get a Penny. <HI>Medera-Wine</HI> and <HI>Bottle-Beer</HI> are Fifteen Pence the Bottle; nasty <HI>Clarrat,</HI> half a Crown; <HI>Rennish,</HI> Five Shillings; and their best <HI>Canary,</HI> Ten Bits, or Six and Three Pence.

<P>They are all <HI>Colonels, Majors, Captains, Lieutenants,</HI> and <HI>Ensigns,</HI> the two last being held in such disdain, that they are look'd upon as a <HI>Bungling Diver</HI> amongst a Gang of Expert Pick-pockets <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>They regard nothing but Money, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> not how they got it, there being no other Felicity to be enjoy'd but purely Riches.

<P>A little Reputation among the <HI>Women,</HI> goes a great way; and if their Actions be answerable to their Looks, they may vie <HI>Wickedness</HI> with the <HI>Devil</HI>: An <HI>Impudent Air,</HI> being the only <HI>Charms</HI> of their <HI>Countenance,</HI> and a <HI>Lewd Carriage,</HI> the <HI>Studi'd Grace</HI> of their <HI>Deportment.</HI> They are such wh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> have been <HI>Scandalous</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to the ut|most degre, either <HI>Transported</HI> by the <HI>State,</HI> or led by their <HI>Vicious Inclinations,</HI> where they may be <HI>Wicked</HI> without <HI>Shame,</HI> and <HI>Whore</HI> on without <HI>Punishment.</HI></P>
