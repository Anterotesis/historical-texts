<HEAD>A brief RELATION OF The occa&s;ion and manner of the late fight in the Downs, betwixt the Fleet of the Common-wealth of England under the command of Gener all Blague, and that of the States of the united Provinces under the command of Admiral Trump, May, 19 1652. according to an accompt gi|ven by divers who were eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es of the action.</HEAD>
<P>_BEfore we proced to the main, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give you (as a preparative there|unto) a &s;hort view of the behaviour of certain Dutch &s;hips towards Capt. Young, Capt. of the Pre&s;ident Frigot.</P>
<P>As Captain Young was comming to the We&s;tward, to take the command of the We&s;t-guard,
<PB N="4" REF="3">the 12 in&s;tant, he di&s;cried a Fleet of about 12 &s;ail com|ming from the Southward; and making &s;ail off to them, he found them to be a Fleet of Hollanders come from Genoa and Legorn. Three with Flags were &s;tates men of war for convoy, the re&s;t Merchants &s;hips. Hereupon Captain Young &s;ent his Ma&s;ter to the Admirall to let them know that amity was as yet continued between the two States, and therefore that he &s;ummoned him to &s;trike.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Admirall took in his Flagg, and put a|broad a P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ndant, &s;aying he belonged to Am&s;terdam. But then the Vice-Admirall came up with his Flagg abroad, being a &s;hip of 42 guns who would by no means be per|&s;waded to &s;trike, though called on over and over. Then Captain Young fitting him&s;elf gave him abroad &s;ide, and received another from him, which made the re&s;t to in|gage, but after the exchange of four or five broad &s;ides, Captain Reynolds and Captain Chapman comming in, the Rear and Vice-Admirall al&s;o were at length forced to &s;trike; which being done, they were civilly u&s;ed in regard of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e treaty on foot betwixt both nations.</P>
<P>The Vice Admirall was much &s;hattered, and it &s;eems nothing but pure nece&s;&s;ity made him &s;trike, for, he &s;ent Capt. Young word that his &s;hip was ready to &s;ink having four foot water in the hold; and that he had order from the States, that if he &s;truck he &s;hould loo&s;e his head for it.</P>
<P>Now that which in the next place is mo&s;t remarkable is the behaviour or the Dutch the day before this la&s;t fight; which &s;eemed very fair.</P>
<P>For, Upon the 18 in&s;tant, Van Trump with a Fleet of 42 &s;ail on the back &s;ide of Goodwins &s;ands, was di&s;|covered by Major Bourn who command the Andrew,
<PB N="5" REF="3">and by the re&s;t of our &s;hips riding in the Downs. They bearing towards the Road, Major Bourn commmanded the Greyhound to make &s;ail and to &s;tand out and &s;peak with them, who when &s;he came near &s;truck their Top &s;ails, demeaning them&s;elves civilly, and &s;aying, they came from Admiral Trump with a me&s;&s;age to the commander in chief in the Downs. Hereupon they &s;tood out in the Road with our Squadron, and comming aboard, they in the name of their General very plau&s;ibly &s;aluted our &s;hips with this account, in order they &s;aid) unto the &s;a|tisfaction of this nation; how that the Northerly winds having blown hard for divers days, they were put fur|ther to the Sout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ward then they intended, they having rode for &s;ome days off Dunkirk, where they had lo&s;t &s;e|verall of their Anchors and cables; adding that they had no intention of injury to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>Yet even at that time, our &s;hips were jealous they had &s;ome de&s;ign in their &s;o near approach, becau&s;e an expre&s;|&s;ion dropped from one of their Captains in di&s;cour&s;e, which did import that they were unwilling to &s;trike their flagg. And however di&s;gui&s;ed, their comming thus could be no le&s;&s;e then a Bravado, &s;ince it was then in their choice whether they would have came &s;o near our Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">et or no; Gen. Blague was at that time al&s;o We&s;tward with the greate&s;t part of the Fleet, to whom Major Bourn im|mediately &s;ent an expre&s;&s;e of all that pa&s;&s;ed, and ordered the A&s;&s;urance and the Grey hound to he near their Fleet that night, to ob&s;erve their motion.</P>
<P>Generall Blague being in Rye Bay, did there r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ceive the expre&s;&s;e with an account of all from Major Bourn; whereupon he made all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to ply up towards them, and on VVedne&s;day the nineteenth in&s;tant in the
<PB N="6" REF="4">morning, he &s;aw them at Anchor in and near Dover road.</P>
<P>Being come within three Leagues of them, they weigh|ed, and &s;tood away by a wind to the Ea&s;t-ward, our Fleet &s;uppo&s;ing their intention was to leave us to avoid the di&s;pute of the Flag. About two hours after they altered their cour&s;e; For, a Captain of their own, now our pri&s;oner, confe&s;&s;eth, that as they rode off towards the French coa&s;t, a &s;hip of the States of Holland came to|wards them, and made a waft with his Flag to Vantrump, who bore up to that &s;hip, and a boat went from that a|board Vantrump. Whereupon he immediately made all the &s;ail he could, ha&s;tening with his Fleet towards ours, and bore up directly with our Fleet, him&s;elf being head|mo&s;t of his own.</P>
<P>Being come near, within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, Gen. Blague &s;hot a Gun. but without a Ball, at his Flag; which he did al&s;o twice more, Vantrump an&s;wering him with a Gun on the aver&s;e &s;ide of his &s;hip, which &s;ignified a high di&s;dain or &s;corn (according to the Sea-cu&s;tome) and then immediately, in&s;tead of &s;triking (according to the ancient U&s;age) hee hung out a red Flag, which his Of|ficers that wee have taken, confe&s;&s;e was the Signall, and gave our General a Broad-&s;ide, and &s;o the fight began about four of the Clock in the Evening, farre otherwi&s;e then what hath beene reported by Trump him&s;elfe, and others.</P>
<P>Then Major Bourn coming in to the engagement with eight &s;hips more, the fight was continued for above foure hours till night parted them.</P>
<P>The next morning the Dutch Fleet was e&s;pied about four leagues di&s;tance from ours towards the Coa&s;t of France. What harme wee have done them is not fully
<PB N="7" REF="4">knowne, but one of them was &s;uppo&s;ed to bee &s;unke, and another of thirty Guns we have taken, with the Captains of both, the Maine-ma&s;t of the fir&s;t beeing &s;hot by the Board, and much water in the Hold, which made one of our Captaines to give her over as in a &s;inking condi|tion. We have &s;ix men of our Admirals &s;lain, and nine or ten de&s;perately wounded, and five and twenty more not without danger, among them the Ma&s;ter and one of his Mates.</P>
<P>The Admiral received above &s;eventy great &s;hot in the Hull and Ma&s;ts; but in the Sails and Rigging without number, having ingaged &s;ome time alone with the whole body of the Dutch Fleet; and though he were the princi|pal man that they aimed at, yet he came off wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">h honour.</P>
<P>One thing may not be omitted, that upon news of this fight, divers &s;ea men of Dover, Deal, and Sandwich, to the number of three hundred voluntarily boated them|&s;elves to our Fleet; and though ingaged in the Generalls &s;hip, in the heat of the fight, came off without the lo&s;&s;e of one man.</P>
<P>Since this, we under&s;tand that Generall Blague plies to and again with his Fleet, being well reinforced, and that Trump with his Fleet is returned home. We have pri|&s;oners of the Dutch two Captains, two Lievtenant, and about a hundred and fifty others.</P>
<P>One thing more is to be added to our fore-going rela|tion, which is very ob&s;ervable; how that as Trump came on towards our Admirall, he commanded up two of his men, who kept &s;till at the top of his Main Ma&s;t, as if they ment to take down the flagg; a pretty my&s;terious pa&s;|&s;age to amu&s;e us touching their intention. We &s;hall make no inference upon the whole matter, but leave the world to judge.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P> Since this great blow given by the Engli&s;h, the States of Holland have called a General Councel, who&s;e re&s;ults tended to peace and unity with the Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">n-wealth of England, and declared their Re&s;olutions for a Union. Yet notwith&s;tanding, many of them &s;eemed to own what Van Trump had done in the precedent action, and to that end, Declared, That an Act, or Edict, &s;hould be forthwith publi&s;hed in reference thereunto. But the States General are clear of a contrary opinion, and &s;eem to be exceeding|ly exa&s;perated again&s;t all tho&s;e that &s;hall be in&s;trumen|tal, aiding, contriving, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting, in making a breach with England.</P>
<P>There is an additional Fleet of 100 &s;ail &s;etting forth, their De&s;ign pretended, for the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of the United Provinces: Neverthele&s;s, many of the Dutchmen rage exceedingly, and &s;wear to be revenged of the Engli&s;h. Their great Threats are little to be feared; and as they liked their la&s;t Supper, &s;o let them prepare for a Break-fa&s;t.</P>
