<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Thur&s;day la&s;t being the 2. of this in&s;tant Novem. we received an Allarum from Sea, occa&s;ioned by certaine &s;hips, who had the
<PB N="2" REF="3">Princes colours, and &s;truck &s;ayl within three leagues of <HI>Helverd-&s;tuce;</HI> whereupon the Lord Amirall &s;ent forth three Frigats, and two of the great Ve&s;&s;els, who cha&s;ed them, and gave them many a gallant &s;hot, and after few hours di&s;pute, boarded one of them, &amp; &s;unk another; the Ma&s;ter of the prize which was taken, con|fe&s;&s;ed, that they were bound for the Prince, with a re|&s;olution to joyn with him, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Highne&s;&s;e a|gain&s;t the Parliament.</P>
<P>This Fleet is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of about eleven &s;hips, mo&s;t of them being men of Warre, and it is rumour'd, that they were mo&s;t of them Swedi&s;h Ships.</P>
<P>But the Princes Fleet hath declared, that they will not be commanded by any &s;trangers, who &s;ince the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing of the Lord <HI>VVilloughby,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Batten,</HI> have made Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Lord Admirall; but the Sea-men were &s;o much inraged and troubled thereat, that they began to mutiny, re&s;i&s;ted the Command of Pr. <HI>Rupert</HI> and the re&s;t of the Iri&s;h and Dutch Commanders&punc; fell to blowes, killed 3 or 4 eminent Commanders, woun|ded divers of them, among&s;t the re&s;t, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> hath received a dangerous wound, and its thought mor|tall. The Conflict being ended, the Mariners of the re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">olted &s;hips called a Councell among&s;t them&s;elves, turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ut Pr. <HI>Rupert,</HI> and divers others, and have made choice of new Commanders.</P>
<P>They have &s;ent a Letter to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> to in|vite him aboard; but by rea&s;on of the weakne&s;&s;e of his body, occa&s;ioned by &s;udden &s;ickne&s;&s;e, and a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, He cannot an&s;wer their expectations.</P>
<P>The Lord Admiral hath again offered them Indem|nity,
<PB REF="3">and it is conceived they will embrace the &s;ame, for they have prote&s;ted to his Lord&s;hip, never to in|gage with the Princes Cavalry; The Lord Admirall hath &s;ent a Declaration to them, advertizing.</P>
<P><HI>That He will u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours towards the &s;etling of truth, and a happy peace in this un&s;etled Church and Kingdom, and that He will be instrumentall for the bringing of his Maje&s;ty to London, and &s;etling of His Maie&s;ty, the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>the Duke of</HI> York, <HI>and the re&s;t of His Royall I&s;sue in their ju&s;t Rights and privi|ledges, &s; &s;oon as His Majesty &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;atisfie and confirme the De&s;ires of his two Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;o much tending to the good and pre&s;ervation both of Re|ligion, Crown and Lingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>Some Overtures have been lately made betweene his Highne&s;&s;e the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his Lord&s;hip, in relation to a conjunction and uniting of both Navies; but his Lord&s;hip hath utterly dete&s;ted again&s;t the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">me, &s;lighting the Princes invitation and repre&s;enting a Letter unto his Highne&s;&s;e, That he takes it as the greate&s;t di&s;honour that can be incident to man, for any Per&s;onage what&s;oever to betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and that He is re&s;olved to &s;acrifice his life in the Cau&s;e and Engagement which he hath undertaken, not doubting but that the omnipotent God of Heaven (to whom the Honour of his Engagement doth belong) will cau&s;e the Wnids and Seas to fight for them, who&s;e Truth is their Banner, Shield and Bucker; and therefore dehorts his Highne&s;&s;e to per&s;i&s;t no longer in the way he is in, but forthwith to come in, and unite him&s;elf with the Parliament, that &s;o his per&s;on may be pre&s;erved from all violence and injury, and a re&s;to|ration made of all due Rights and priviledges, and that he may render him&s;elf in&s;trumentall for the compo|&s;ing of all differences, and e&s;tabll&s;hing of a firme and

<P>This Letter is &s;aid to be &s;ent from aboard the St. <HI>George,</HI> to the Prince at <HI>Helver-Sluce,</HI></P>
<P>Letters further from the Navy &s;ay, That the Prince is de&s;irous to &s;pin out &s;ome longer time at <HI>Goree</HI> be|fore he puts to Sea, in expectation of what the Treaty wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> produce, and that if it takes not effect, he is re&s;ol|ved for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to joyn with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Inchiqueen,</HI> and to land an Army in the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> at the Spring, for the re-inve&s;ting of the King, and re&s;toring of Him to his ju&s;t Rights, Po|wer and Authority</P>
<P>The &s;aid Letters do further intimate, That the Lord high Admirall hath received a Letter from his Maje|&s;ty, purporting things of great concernment, and how farre he hath conde&s;cended to the de&s;ires of his two Hou&s;es, de&s;iring him to be in&s;trumentall for the &s;et|ling of a firm and la&s;ting peace.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my la&s;t, Here hath hapned &s;everall Overtures between his Maje&s;ty and the Parliaments Commi&s;|&s;ioners; they have had much debate upon the Propo|&s;itions, e&s;pecially that concerning the Church, which the King &s;tuck much at; but the dark Cloud being ex|pelled, and the &s;plendor of the Go&s;pell &s;hining mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly in the eyes of his Maje&s;ty, He was graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to declare his Royall A&s;&s;ent to all the Propo&s;itions, and to grant His Royall Word to pa&s;&s;e all things de&s;ired by his two Hou&s;es, that may be agreeable and con&s;onant to the fundamentall Lawes
<PB N="6" REF="4">of this Kingdom. And as to the bu&s;ines of the Church (which is all they &s;tick at) the King hath promi&s;ed to give his concurrence therein, rather then his People &s;hall &s;uffer for his di&s;-a&s;&s;enting. And 14 dayes more being added to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> it is hoped a fair conclu&s;ion will attend the happy beginning.

<P>HIs Maje&s;ty re&s;teth very much un&s;atisfied, That you have now again wholly declined the an&s;we|ring of tho&s;e three que&s;tions &s;o clearly propo&s;ed by him, which your &s;elves al&s;o confe&s;&s;e to be of grea im|portance, upon this only pretence, <HI>That the whole volumn of Eccle&s;iasticall policy is contained in them:</HI> Whereas his Maje&s;ty did neither expect nor require from you any large or polemicall Di&s;cour&s;e concerning tho&s;e Que&s;tions conceiving that you were in &s;ome &s;ort ob|liged to have declared what your judgment was there|in, with the grounds thereof. For certainly untill one of the&s;e three things can be clearly evidenced unto his Maj. 1. Either that there is no certain form of Church Government at all pre&s;cribed in the Word. 2 That the Civill power may change the fame as they &s;ee cau&s;e. 3 Or if it be unchangable, that it was not Epi&s;copall, but &s;ome other, his Maj. thinks him&s;elf excu&s;able in the judgment of all rea&s;onable men, if he cannot be indu|ced to give his con&s;ent to the utter abolition of that Government of the Church which he found here &s;et|led to his hands, which hath continued all over the Chri&s;tian world, from the times of the Apo&s;tles untill this la&s;t Age.</P>

<P>And for the better faciliating the Work in hand, we hear that his <HI>Majesty</HI> hath &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age (by the D. of <HI>Lenox</HI>) to the Aldermen and Common-councell of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and al&s;o to divers members of both Hou&s;es, intimating, <HI>That He de&s;ired a longer time to be added to the Treaty, de&s;iring them to be in&s;trumen|tall for the re-inve&s;ting of his Maie&s;ty, and to agitate for his &s;peedy comming to</HI> London, with other remarkable Occurrences, which He de&s;ires may be cammunicated to his Royall hearted Citizens, and that they may &s;eri|ou&s;ly read and peru&s;e the &s;ame. It is conceived his Ma|je&s;ty hath &s;ome notable de&s;ign again&s;t the Army, for He hath vowed to play a new Game, if the Treaty take not effect. But upon the clo&s;e of this Letter, here arrived a <HI>Po&s;t</HI> from the Army to Col. <HI>Hamond,</HI> de&s;iring him to be vigilant for the la&s;t 14 dayes added to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and to prevent his <HI>Maie&s;ties</HI> e&s;cape there being a de&s;ign laid for the conveying of his per&s;on away, if he cannot accompli&s;h his de&s;ires in the &s;aid re&s;pit of time.
