<P>_SInce my la&s;t of the &s;econd of this in&s;tant, we have received certain information of the further proceedings of the Prin|ces Fleet, and that they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> the Navy into three Squadrons; the fir&s;t commanded by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who is to guard the Iri&s;h Seas, and to attend the motion of Col. <HI>Jones</HI> Governor of the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> for the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> the &s;econd, by Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who with 20 Sayle is
<PB N="2" REF="3">to attend the motion of Captain <HI>Moulton</HI> in the We|&s;tern Riding; the third by Captain <HI>Jerden,</HI> de&s;igned for the Lands-End, to attend the motion and coming out of the parliaments Summers Fleet; all which, though numerous in &s;hipping, yet weakly man'd, and dare not engage, unle&s;&s;e with great advantage, the Sea|men begin to moulter in their affections, and &s;hew a great di&s;like of the proceedings of their Officers; for divers who have e&s;caped at their coming into Creekes, do declare, That they begin to langui&s;h for their late perfidious Revolt, and would fain make a recantation, and that if once they could have the opportunity to come a&s;hore, are unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to de&s;ert the princes &s;ervice: however, if they cannot purcha&s;e their liberty one way, they are re&s;olved to faciliate it ano|the; and that upon a neer Engagement with the Parlia|ments Fleet, it is believed they will take the &s;ame re&s;o|lution as the Land Souldiers have formerly done, and (upon good articles and conditions) deliver up their Officers to mercy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some action hath lately hapned between divers Mar|chants, and prince <HI>Manrice</HI> his &s;hips, and much hurt done on both &s;ides; but after &s;ome di&s;pute, and &s;everall boardings, the Victory fell to the Marchant Men of War, who &s;unk two of the revolted &s;hips, wherin was 50 piece of Ordnance, and cha&s;ed the re&s;t above &s;even Leagues, but by rea&s;on of a &s;torm, they were forced to de&s;i&s;t from further pur&s;uit, and to leave them to the mercy of the raging Billowes.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hips are &s;aid to be bound for <HI>London, Lyn,</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> who hold conjunction together for the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of their Marchandize.</P>

<P>Since which time we have received other joyfull in|telligence from the <HI>Maurician</HI> Fleet, and it is likewi&s;e confirmed by two men of War who la&s;t night ca&s;t anchor in this Harbour: they purport, that upon their cro&s;&s;ing the We&s;tern Channell, they were &s;et upon by &s;ix of the princes &s;hips, who gave them 12. broad &s;ides, but were an&s;wered again with another Volley from the Sons of <HI>Mars,</HI> and after a hot conflict, be|came victiorious, killing many of their men, cha&s;ing the re&s;t, &s;ome taking their pur&s;uit without a Ma&s;t, o|thers without a &s;tern, and their Sayls all rent and torn. But by rea&s;on of the di&s;tempers of the Sea, and the dangerous breaches they had received from the Ene|mies round &s;hot, were forced to &s;trike in here for re|fuge, for the repairing and new rigging of their &s;hips. Tho&s;e who have been in action with them, report them to be as cowardly an Enemy, as ever engaged upon the Neptune Seas, and that 30 of the parliaments &s;hips wel man'd, will (in all probability) &s;oon expell the fury of 60 of theirs.</P>
<P>We heare that Capt. <HI>Moulton</HI> is in a defen&s;ive po|&s;ture, and that he &s;ayles &s;ometimes within &s;ight of the princes Fleet, but declines engagement at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e hear of a great in&s;urrection ari&s;ing in prince <HI>Ruperts</HI> Squadron, the manner thus: two Sea|man &s;peaking &s;ome words touching the unju&s;tne&s;&s;e of their cau&s;e, and the unlawfulne&s;&s;e of their engagement, being over-heard, were brought before the prince, and (according to Martial Law) were adjudged to die, and to be hang'd up at the main Ma&s;t, but the Seamen hea|ring thereof, unanimou&s;ly re&s;cued him from the po|wer of the Mar&s;hal; other Captains were &s;ummoned, to &s;ee the princes tyranny performed, but their Mariners likewi&s;e joyntly re&s;olved not to execute the &s;ame.</P>
