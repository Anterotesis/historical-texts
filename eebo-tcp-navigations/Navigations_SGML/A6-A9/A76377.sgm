<HEAD>AN ADVERTISEMENT To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Need but &s;ay that the fir&s;t Part of this No|vel was writ by that fine Wit, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de S. Bremond,</HI> to in|form the Reader of its worth, and that there want|ed nothing but a conclu&s;ive Part, to compleat it in all re&s;pects.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Having accidentally met with it, I liked it &s;o well as to wi&s;h for a Continuation, which I afterward de&s;pair|ed ever to &s;ee, hearing that the Author having retired him&s;elf in <HI>Holland</HI> at the fir&s;t rumour of the late Plot, there he had conclu|ded all his Works, with the la&s;t period of his life.</P>
<P>I was not the only Per&s;on that regretted the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a Pen, there were divers of the fir&s;t Rank in Wit and Quality, that did
<PB REF="3">al&s;o condole his death, and wi&s;h'd that he had liv'd, at lea&s;t &s;o long as to have fi|ni&s;h'd the Novel of the <HI>Pil|grim.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as I had been in|formed of his Death, I had made a rough draught, which peradventure I might afterwards have &s;pun out into a &s;econd Part, for my own &s;atisfaction: But &s;ome few Months after this fal&s;e Report having been di&s;|proved, by a Letter from <HI>Holland</HI> under his own
<PB REF="4">Hand, I gave over the pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P>Yet I could not wholly de&s;i&s;t from nibling at &s;o pretty a piece of Wit, wherefore, and in order to gratifie &s;ome Per&s;ons of our Nation, I made it <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> and took the boldne&s;s to Dedicate it to that great Pattern as well as Patro|ne&s;s of Wit and Ingenuity, the Illu&s;trious Dutche&s;s of <HI>Albemarle;</HI> who was plea&s;ed to receive it with that Generous Bounty, and
<PB REF="4">&s;ingular Affability, where|with &s;he u&s;ually allays the &s;plendour of her Greatne&s;s, and con&s;ents that vulgar Eyes &s;hould be cheri&s;hed with tho&s;e Beams of her Lu|&s;tre, which otherwi&s;e would de&s;troy their Opticks.</P>
<P>That incomparable He|roine had no &s;ooner ca&s;t her di&s;cerning Eyes over it, but that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed an ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing a &s;econd Part, which made me in|form her Grace of what I had done by way of diver|ti&s;ement,
<PB REF="5">telling her withall, that I wi&s;hed her Grace might find out &s;ome Per&s;on capable of fini&s;hing it, ac|knowledging my &s;elf too weak to proceed any further on a Subject, and in &s;uch a Style, unto which I was &s;o great a Stranger: Yet her Graces Commands, with the hopes that &s;he her &s;elf would take the pains to amend tho&s;e Errors which I &s;hould be apt to commit in the per|formance, did afterwards embolden me to undertake it.
<PB REF="5">After which her Grace was plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s me, with this Caution, that where|as &s;he perceived that the <HI>French</HI> Author, accord|ing to the Genius of his own Country, did not make his Heroine appear unto the World altogether &s;o fair, and free from Cen&s;ure, as be might have done, &s;he en|joined me to redre&s;s her, and to bring her off with credit, &s;o far as her little &s;allies and gayeties in the fir&s;t Part would permit me
<PB REF="6">to act, without palpable Contradictions.</P>
<P>Who could refu&s;e an en|tire Obedience to the Com|mands of &s;o Illu&s;trious a Per&s;on? As if I had been in&s;pired with a new Soul at her Graces Orders, I im|mediately went to work, not|with&s;tanding all my imper|fection and in&s;ufficiency, &s;o that in the &s;pace of three Weeks I brought forth this &s;econd Part of the <HI>Pil|grim,</HI> which I here pre|&s;ent to the Reader. But
<PB REF="6">it was &s;o unlike its elder Brother (as it was ea&s;ily di&s;cernable by any ordina|ry Capacity) that notwith|&s;tanding her Graces peru|&s;al and amendments, ma|king the be&s;t that &s;he could of &s;o ill a thing, as requi|red a general Reforma|tion to have it without fault, it is not freed from all Defects.</P>
<P>Receive that which is good in it, as the Corre|ctions from her Graces Pen,
<PB REF="7">and what is ami&s;s I and the Printer will take upon us; however I hope that the Reader will find &s;o much &s;atisfaction in it as will not let him regret the laying out of his Money on it.</P>

<HEAD>THE PILGRIM.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Second Part.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about break of Day when our Pilgrim, impati|ent to be on the Territories of <HI>France,</HI> gets up to look about him, and to enquire what progre&s;s the Ve&s;&s;el had alrea|dy made in their Journey; for &s;o long as he was on that fickle Ele|ment he thought him&s;elf un&s;afe, not knowing what new turn of Fortune might overtake him, and bring him back to vi&s;it his la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> me|lancholik
<PB N="2" REF="8">Lodgings: Be&s;ides, his happy and unexpected deliverance from a double Slavery, did appear to him &s;o like a Dream, that he did &s;till remain in &s;ome apprehen|&s;ions of carrying along with him the wor&s;t of his afflictions. This made him to inquire of the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, what other compa|ny there was with him: The Ma|&s;ter told him, that there was none be&s;ides a Fryer of St. <HI>Dominick</HI>'s Order; and a Woman: A Wo|man? replyed <HI>Camille,</HI> being &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd; then am I as mi&s;erable as ever, and find that I mu&s;t never hope for any end to my misfortunes. Had you orders, continued he, to take in any other per&s;on be&s;ides my &s;elf? Sir, reply|ed the Ma&s;ter, the Father who hired it la&s;t night, did agree with me for the tran&s;porting of him&s;elf, and two other per&s;ons, and your &s;elf, the Father and that Woman make up that number, neither
<PB N="3" REF="8">dur&s;t I take any more into my Bark, becau&s;e of the Governours &s;trict Orders, that I &s;hould imme|diately depart. Our Pilgrim was &s;o troubled at what the Ma&s;ter had &s;aid, that holding down his Head, his Hat drawn over his Face, his Arms acro&s;s, leaning on his Staff, with his Eyes fixed on the Deck, he &s;tood as mute, as if he had been &s;truck with Thunder; but while he appear'd &s;o like a Statue outward|ly, his Heart was agitated within with &s;uch a Confu&s;ion of thoughts, as were the cau&s;e of his repre&s;en|ting &s;o odd a Figure. Sometime he was thinking, what could be the rea&s;on that the wi&s;e Governour &s;hould give &s;uch &s;trict Charge to the Marriners for his immediate de|parture, and yet be &s;o negligent in the &s;ecuring of his Wife from getting into the Felouqua with him: Then again it did very much &s;urprize him, that <HI>Danna Barbara</HI> &s;hould change her mind as to her
<PB N="4" REF="9">di&s;gui&s;e, and hazzard her &s;elf in Womans Apparel; but then it came to his thoughts, that it was peradventure for her better &s;ecurity in ca&s;e her Husband had been in|form'd of the dre&s;s which &s;he had de&s;ign'd to go in; and &s;o by re|maining in womans Apparel, had cheated him the &s;econd time. By and by, again, his mind would be bu&s;ied in making out, whether Fa|ther <HI>Andrew,</HI> and <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> were got into the Ve&s;&s;el, in order to go along with him, or that they believing him &s;till a Pri&s;oner in the red Tower, they had come thither to &s;helter them&s;elves from the Governours pre&s;ent rage, and &s;o had abandon'd him to the furi|ous pa&s;&s;ions that a jealous man of the Power and Authority that the Governour was, could employ in order to his ruin. If &s;o&punc; then of con&s;equence, tho&s;e orders that had been given to the Ma&s;ter as from the Governour, he did con|clude
<PB N="5" REF="9">to be of their own fabrick, to ha&s;ten the departure of the Ve&s;&s;el, for fear of a &s;urpri&s;al. The&s;e, and many other confu&s;ed notions po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing his whole imagination; he remain'd unre&s;olv'd, not know|ing what to conclude on: Once he was for di&s;covering unto the Ma&s;ter, who that Fryer and that Woman were, which he had taken into his Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;o per&s;uade him that he would do the Governour a &s;ingu|lar piece of Service, in carrying them back to <HI>Barcellonna:</HI> But he thought that it would be very dif|cult for him to prevail with the Ma|&s;ter, again&s;t the Governours po&s;itive Orders. Be&s;ides, if it &s;hould prove, that the two Pa&s;&s;engers that were with him &s;hould not be the Father and the Governe&s;s, it would be a great di&s;advantage to him&s;elf to be carried back; he did believe that it was very unlikely, that at that time of the Night, and at &s;uch a Criti|cal moment, any other Fryer and
<PB N="6" REF="10">Woman than them, could come &s;o pat to embark them&s;elves in that very Ve&s;&s;el that had been hired for them. This at la&s;t made him con|clude that the good Father and the Governours Wife were in the Fe|louqua with him, yet that perad|venture they might not know of his being there, which &s;et him up|on the de&s;ign of concealing him&s;elf, that he might get on &s;hore with|out their knowledg of his being there. In this la&s;t re&s;olution, he goes to the Ma&s;ter, and having dropt &s;ome Pi&s;tols into his hand, he whi&s;pered to him, that for &s;ome particular rea&s;ons he would lye con|cealed from the knowledge of tho&s;e two per&s;ons that were with him, that therefore he would be convey|ed where he might remain un&s;een; till the re&s;t were landed, and then that he would come to &s;hore him|&s;elf. The Ma&s;ter having return'd his thanks, took <HI>Camille</HI> by the hand, and having conducted him into
<PB N="7" REF="10">a little hole like a Cabin, he left him with an a&s;&s;urance that there he might lye as &s;ecure as he pleas'd.</P>
<P>The Wind was &s;o favourable, as in a &s;hort time to convey them in view of <HI>Narbona,</HI> at which the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el cry'd out a|loud, that all might take notice of it; that who had a mind to go to &s;hore, &s;hould begin to prepare for it. At the&s;e glad tidings, Fa|ther <HI>Andrew,</HI> who had lain all the while as &s;till as a Dore-mou&s;e, ri&s;es and goes to the Governe&s;s, telling her, that if &s;he pleas'd to look forth, &s;he might behold their wi&s;h'd for Harbour; but receiving no an&s;wer, he retired, conclu|ding her a&s;leep, after her long Fatigue, and great Di&s;a&s;ters. He gets upon the Deck and acco&s;ts the Ma&s;ter in this manner; Are you &s;ure, &s;aid he, that that is <HI>Narbo|na?</HI> pointing at the City, and in the <HI>French</HI> Dominions: Yes, re|plyed the Ma&s;ter; at which good
<PB N="8" REF="11">news, The Fryers countenance was chang'd from melancholy, to as &s;erene, as was the Weather. In the opinion, that <HI>Donna Barba|ra</HI> was not come away empty hand|ed, he begins to build &s;trange Ca&s;tles in the Air, in his imagi|nation, making already a pri&s;e of her and of her Trea&s;ure; now that he did find him&s;elf, out of the Governours reach, and pa&s;s'd being controul'd by the abandoned Pil|grim in that height of thoughts, he has not patience to remain any longer mew'd up within the nar|row compa&s;s of a Boat, which made him to return unto the Lady, and intreat her to ari&s;e, and pre|pare to go to &s;hore, but having no an&s;wer yet, he employs his hands, where the Darkne&s;s of the place did deprive him of the u&s;e of his Eyes, and finding that the Lady was not concern'd at his touch, he adventures further, and meets with her face, which finding
<PB N="9" REF="11">warm and breathing, he de&s;cends Lower with the &s;ame hand, where finding her Brea&s;ts, he made bold with them. This free acce&s;s, with|out the lea&s;t repul&s;e, did &s;o embol|den our jolly Fryer, that he did adventure to convey his other hand lower, when on the &s;uddain, he receiv'd a &s;evere rebuke, accompa|nied with a thundring voice, and pre&s;ently getting off of the Bed, &s;he went to that little light that came in by the Door. The good Father, who had not been a little &s;urpriz'd at the &s;trangene&s;s of the accident, believing that he had mi&s;taken one place for another, was making to|wards the Door to retrieve his way, when he was &s;eiz'd by the Arm, which put him to a &s;tand, but had you &s;een in what a dreadful fear the poor Father was, when lifting up his Head, he e&s;py'd a Face as black as any that ever came from the <HI>Af|frican</HI> &s;hore; which looking on him with a pair of &s;taring Eyes, cryed out in the &s;ame tone as be|fore,
<PB N="10" REF="12">pre&s;&s;ing his hand, you would never have forgot it.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagin that the good Father <HI>Andrew</HI> at this Appa|rition, was not in any great hu|mour of making long compli|ments, on the contrary, he was &s;o de&s;irous to be gone from that black Companion, that running ha&s;tily out, he &s;truck his Head with &s;uch a force again&s;t the Door frame, as did ca&s;t him backwards flat on his back in a &s;woon. The Moori&s;h Woman &s;eeing him lye &s;peechle&s;s on the floor, weltring in his blood, did &s;toop to him, and &s;etting up her voice, to call for help as well as &s;he could, and to bemoan the poor Father; &s;he be|gan to howl much after the manner of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> at their Funerals. At this hideous noi&s;e the Ma&s;ter run to learn what was the matter, which having &s;een, he pre&s;ently went to <HI>Camille</HI> and told him that the Father was fallen backwards
<PB N="11" REF="12">dead, he knew not by what acci|dent, and that there was no body with him, be&s;ides the Moori&s;h Woman, which he had brought a|long with him the la&s;t night. <HI>Ca|mille</HI> learning by this, that <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> was not there, went to &s;ee what was the matter; he found the poor Father, as the ma&s;ter had told him, in a very &s;ad pickle: He caus'd him to be taken up and brought in a Chair upon the Deck, in the open Air; and pre&s;ently af|ter that the good Father had drank a little Wine, which was given him, he began to look about him, while <HI>Camille</HI> was gone to &s;ee who that Woman might be. He was not long before he learned of her, that &s;he was <HI>Donna Barbara's</HI> Slave; who having engaged to be ready to go along with her Lady, and thinking the hour at hand; &s;he had got to the appointed Po&s;t on the Port, whence in her ob&s;curity of the Night &s;he had been led into
<PB N="12" REF="13">the Ve&s;&s;el, where &s;he thought that her Lady was before di&s;pos'd of.</P>
<P>While that this account had been given at one end of the Fe|loqua, Father <HI>Andrew</HI> at the other end having perceiv'd the Marriners flocking about him, he pre&s;ently fancied that they were Men &s;ent by the Governours orders to di&s;patch him, in that belief, the very ap|prehen&s;ion of Death, though he &s;eem'd half dead already, did make him cry out, that he was innocent, that he knew not where was <HI>Don|na Barbara Day amonte,</HI> the Gover|nour of <HI>Barcellonnas</HI> Wife, and that if they killed him, they would murther a harmle&s;s man, a Religi|ous man, and one of the Order of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> who was a Father Confe&s;&s;or al&s;o, for which Crime they &s;hould one day &s;everely an|&s;wer: Look, look, continued he, &s;peaking to tho&s;e that were a|bout him, whether you can find a|ny &s;uch per&s;on here? Neither did
<PB N="13" REF="13">I ever de&s;ign the &s;etting of the Pil|grim at liberty, for he was yet in the red Tower when I went from <HI>Barcellonna,</HI> he was thus going on pleading for life, when tho&s;e men that were about him &s;taring on him, were call'd away, and <HI>Camille</HI> appearing pre&s;ently to him, he was by that &s;et into a greater fright than ever, which he &s;hew'd by endeavouring to get away: <HI>Camille</HI> took him by the hand, and told him that he needed not to fear, becau&s;e there was no per&s;on near him that would do him any injury, that he &s;hould take his word for it, whom he knew to be his friend: By this time the poor Father <HI>An|drew</HI> having with much ado lifted up his Eyes, and perceived <HI>Camille,</HI> and are you here, Sir, &s;aid he, and all alone too, then do I breath a|gain; with that he fetch'd a deep &s;igh, after which he thus continu|ed; and I do begin to believe that all that has lately happen'd unto
<PB N="14" REF="14">me, has been meer delu&s;ion, and a temptation of the Devil; then lifting his hand to his head, which pain'd him; yet there mu&s;t be &s;omthing real in the ca&s;e, continu|ed he, or how &s;hould I feel all this &s;mart el&s;e? And above all things, I wonder mo&s;t how the Devil did put that black fanta&s;me into my hand in the dark, in lew of the Go|verne&s;s? <HI>Camille</HI> finding that he would pre&s;ently fall into a melan|cholly pa&s;&s;ion, if not diverted, de|&s;ired him to re&s;t &s;atisfied, and that he would give him a true account of all &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be got on &s;hore, and that his hurts were dre&s;t: Why, am I wounded then, &s;aid the good Father again, with a great emo|tion of Spirit: Yes, replyed <HI>Camille,</HI> but not by tho&s;e means which you fancy, but re&s;t your &s;elf contented, rely upon me, and all things &s;hall be well again, and you &s;hall have but the hurt on't, without any fur|ther ill con&s;equence: Then <HI>Camille</HI> commanded &s;ome Per&s;ons that were
<PB N="15" REF="14">by, to carry him to &s;hore, which be|ing done, he was dre&s;t and put in a Bed, and <HI>Camille</HI> and the poor Father did remain at <HI>Narbona,</HI> till he was perfectly cured of his broken head.</P>
<P>The next day the Ve&s;&s;el returned to <HI>Barcellona,</HI> whither the Moori&s;h Woman was convey'd back, accor|ding to <HI>Camille</HI>'s orders, where you are to know, that the Go|vernour had with much patience and &s;ecrecy, convey'd his half dead Wife into her Chamber, where he had left her to recover her &s;elf, while he went out to or|der &s;ome of his Servants to &s;eek e|very place in the Palace for Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> and to bring him immedi|ately along with them, pretending that his Wife being fallen de&s;pe|rately ill on the &s;uddain, &s;he had occa&s;ion for him: The Governours de&s;ign in this, was to catch Fa|ther <HI>Andrew</HI> before he were gone, and to bring him to &s;evere puni&s;hment, after, he &s;hould have
<PB N="16" REF="15">vented his pa&s;&s;ion in words upon him and the Governe&s;s, and yet &s;o order the matter, as that the true cau&s;e of all the&s;e di&s;orders &s;hould be conceal'd from his Ser|vants knowledg, and that he might give his Wife time &s;ufficient to recollect her &s;elf, that &s;he and her Factor might with more pati|ence hear what he &s;hould &s;ay to them, he did retire into another Chamber, where he expected that the Fryer &s;hould be brought to him, not doubting but that he &s;hould be found &s;omwhere about the Pa|lace, he having caus'd all the Gates to be &s;hut up, &s;o &s;oon as he had di&s;|covered their de&s;igns: But he reckoned without his Ho&s;t, the Bird was flown, &s;o that having waited a long time, after which his Servants being return'd without their prey, he de&s;ign'd to return to his Wife and give her her le&s;&s;on. But mean time, &s;he having been in|form'd that her Husbhnd had &s;ent
<PB N="17" REF="15">for her Agent, and judging that it was to bring them together, to let fly his revenge upon them both at once; &s;he had retired into tho&s;e lodgings, which were lately the Marquione&s;&s;es, where &s;he had lock'd her &s;elf up, &s;ending back that Wo|man that had gone with her, to tell her Husband where &s;he was retired, to ob&s;erve his motions, and to give her an account of his proceedings again&s;t Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> that by them &s;he might take her mea&s;ures, and judg of his de&s;igns again&s;t her &s;elf. The Governour mi&s;&s;ing of his Wife, ask'd where &s;he was, and having been told that &s;he had re|moved her &s;elf into the Marquio|ne&s;&s;es late lodgings, where &s;he had lock'd her &s;elf up, with a de&s;ign to lye there that night; he troubled him&s;elf no further about it, but went to Bed, re&s;erving the Schooling of her again&s;t the next day.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<P><HI>Donna Barbara</HI> being alone in that Chamber, had too many things in her head to think of &s;leep; &s;he in|tended to employ her time better, in contriving which way to defeat her Husbands de&s;igns of railing at her; &s;he had too high a Spirit, calmly to beare his injuries, and reproaches, and &s;he was re&s;olv'd one way or other, to prevent his Fury. She had opened the Win|dow, to let in the cool Air of the Night, to refre&s;h her fretted Heart; and &s;he was looking out, when ca&s;ting her Eyes towards the &s;hore, &s;he did perceive, as well as the light of the Moon, which then be|gan to ri&s;e, would permit her, at that di&s;tance, a per&s;on that was coming from the Sea &s;hore towards the Palace, who being drawn nearer, did appear to her in a Pil|grims Habit. It came pre&s;ently in|to her head, that it might be <HI>Ca|mille,</HI> who being got out of Pri|&s;on, and not believing what &s;he
<PB N="19" REF="16">had told him of the Marquione&s;s's ab&s;ence, was come under that Win|dow, in hopes to &s;ee the Marqui|one&s;s, or to learn by &s;ome means or other, which fortune might produce in his favour, whether the Lady was gone, or &s;till in her old quarters. <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> did further imagin that the Pilgrim not daring to return to his old lodgings, or be too bu&s;y in enqui|ring el&s;ewhere, for fear of being retaken, and wor&s;e u&s;ed than at fir&s;t, he had thought it his be&s;t cour&s;e to come there him&s;elf, for information; having prepo&s;&s;e&s;t her &s;elf with this conceit, as all per&s;ons are apt to believe that which they mo&s;t de&s;ire, &s;he dropp'd down one of her Gloves, that it might cau&s;e him to look up and take notice of the &s;igns that &s;he did make him to have him &s;tay a while. The thing &s;ucceeded as &s;he had de&s;ir'd, for after the Pilgrim had taken up the Glove, and found by its &s;trong
<PB N="20" REF="17">perfume, that it did not belong to an ordinary hand, he lifted up his head, and perceiv'd &s;ome body that did make him &s;igns, as if they would have him to &s;tay, a little af|ter which they withdrew.</P>
<P>This Per&s;on who had taken up the Glove, being a Pilgrim that was newly come to &s;hore, and was going in Pilgrimage to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> having no other bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Barcello|na,</HI> but to &s;eek for a lodging for that night and to proceed on his jour|ney forwards the next morning, was willing to wait and &s;ee what the &s;ucce&s;s of this would be, there|fore he &s;tayed there, walking up and down till <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> ha|ving writ her mind, and conveyed it into the other Glove, &s;he likewi&s;e did drop it before him. He pre|&s;ently took it up, finds the paper in it, which he takes out, unfolds, and reads, as well as he could; but &s;ome clouds at that in&s;tant ob|&s;curing the Air, &s;o that he could
<PB N="21" REF="17">not make an end; he looks up, but finds that the Per&s;on was reti|red, and the Window &s;hut. Now this Pilgrim being one of tho&s;e per|&s;ons, that like the generality of tho&s;e foot Travellers, was light enough of Money, in ready Ca&s;h, but who are as well provided and &s;tored with Je&s;ts, Songs, and merry Tales as our Country Fidlers, fitted to all &s;orts of humours and conditions, which among&s;t tho&s;e kind of per|&s;ons are as good as &s;o many Bills of exchange, payable at fir&s;t &s;ight; for through the Authority of tho&s;e letters of Credit, and &s;ome little pritty <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> little Cro&s;&s;es, Chaplets, Medals, and the like Toyes, they pa&s;s every where, and make bold to &s;eek for Lodg|ings, and all other conveniencies, in all places, in all companies, and at all times. He thus qualified ha&s;tens into the City, and being made &s;omewhat more bold than ordinarily, by this late adventure
<PB N="22" REF="18">he confidently knocks at a Hou&s;e door, where he &s;aw a Candle, where being admitted and got to a light, he pulls the paper out of his Pocket, and read in it as fol|lows.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;pight of all my Enemies Con|trivances, Plots, and De&s;igns, I have kept my Station: If you con|tinue in the generous de&s;ign of free|ing me from the cruel Tyranny of a Jealous Husband: This next night between one and two repair here a|gain, and bring along with you a Lad|der of Ropes by the help of which, maugre all my Guardians Circum|&s;pections, and</HI> Donna Barbara's <HI>In|telligences, you &s;hall receive into your protection the Marquione&s;s of &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And a little beneath, by way of Po&s;t&s;cript, was writ.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="18">
<P><HI>Excu&s;e my bad writing, through the want of light: Get in readine&s;s a Felouqua again&s;t that time, which may carry us to &s;ome Sea Port of</HI> France. <HI>You need not to fear the Charges; for I &s;hall bring that along with me, that &s;hall be &s;ufficient to de|fray all, and put us beyond want.</HI></P>
<P>At every period of this Letter, the Pilgrim would make a paw&s;e, then read it over again; but when he came to the Po&s;t&s;cript, where mention was made of &s;ufficiency to defray the Charges, and to put them beyond want, he did read that place twenty times over, and having look'd once again on the word Marquione&s;s, all tho&s;e little di&s;tru&s;ts and Jealou&s;ies, which had po&s;&s;e&s;t him during the reading of the Letter, did vani&s;h into Air, and as if the word Marquione&s;s had fill'd him with another Spirit than his own, he did re&s;olve within him|&s;elf,
<PB N="24" REF="19">to act that per&s;on's part, for whom he was taken; thus he re|&s;olv'd to take opportunity by the foretop, and not to part with her till he had built his own Fortune. To encourage him&s;elf in this re&s;o|lution, he calls for the be&s;t that the hou&s;e would afford, enquires if there were not a Marquione&s;s that lay in the Palace, who had a Jea|lous Husband: He is an&s;wered that there was &s;uch a one, but that it was reported that her Husband was gone with her the morning be|fore; The news of the Marquis, and of his Ladies ab&s;ence did make him build the &s;tronger upon that bottom, in lew of deterring him, &s;o that he long'd till the time was come to get off the Lady.</P>
<P>To that purpo&s;e, &s;o &s;oon as it was convenient to &s;tir forth, he pays his reckoning, and goes out to hire a Felouqua to provide a Ladder of Ropes, with all other nece&s;&s;aries for the Voyage, which
<PB N="25" REF="19">all his little &s;tock would but ju&s;t reach to; but while he was bu&s;ie a|bout this, a &s;mall &s;cruple aro&s;e in his mind, which was, that doubt|le&s;s the right Per&s;on intended to be employ'd by the Marquione&s;s, could be no le&s;s than &s;ome per&s;on of quality, which made him fear, that when the Lady &s;hould di&s;cover his Pilgrims weeds, &s;he might find out her mi&s;take, retire before he had her &s;ure, and &s;o leave him at all the Co&s;t and Charges, to his ut|ter ruine: This con&s;ideration was of weight; but he knew no other way to remedy it, than in preten|ding, that he made u&s;e of that Ha|bit to be di&s;guis'd, and that through its favourable a&s;pect, they might pa&s;s with more &s;afety into the Fe|louqua. This, with the pro&s;pect which he had of making his For|tune, did cau&s;e him to pu&s;h on, and to venture at all, leaving the &s;uc|ce&s;s to the di&s;po&s;al of Fortune, who commonly a&s;&s;i&s;ts the bold. With
<PB N="26" REF="20">this la&s;t re&s;olution he continues his de&s;igns, and gets all things in rea|dine&s;s again&s;t the appointed hour; which being come, out goes our Pilgrim, and gets under the Win|dow whence he had receiv'd the fir&s;t Summons; he was not long there before he heard it open, and pre&s;ently after a Cord was let down, at which he having fa&s;tned the Ladder of Ropes, it was pre|&s;ently pull'd up again, and not long after <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> came down by it, clo&s;e mufled up, lea&s;t that the Pilgrim &s;hou'd find out her deceit; &s;he did no &s;ooner touch ground, but telling him in a di&s;|gui&s;ed tone, that there was no time to loo&s;e, for fear of a pur&s;uit, &s;he pull'd him along by the Arm, not giving time to an&s;wer, which pleas'd him very well, who was as willing as &s;he was to keep &s;ilence, &s;o that they both ha&s;ten'd to the Ve&s;&s;el, in equall fears of being di&s;|covered by one another: So &s;oon
<PB N="27" REF="20">as they were come to the Felouqua, the Ma&s;ter di&s;pos'd of them &s;everal|ly, as the Lady de&s;ired, and pre|&s;ently they put off to Sea, making all the Sails they could for <HI>Narbona.</HI></P>
<P>Mean time the Governour, who had through his Wifes Importuni|ties granted her two days retire|ment, only in order to plague her the more &s;everely afterwards, did not &s;o much as once offer to di&s;turb her, during the whole time of the Truce; but the term being expir'd, his pati|ence was at an end al&s;o: And having &s;ent divers of his Servants one after another to have the Door open'd to him though to no effect; he went thither him&s;elf, where having di|vers times call'd and knock'd at the Chamber door, to as little purpo&s;e, he caus'd it to be broke open, and his anger being exa&s;perated by his Wifes re&s;i&s;tance, he pre&s;ently ru&s;hes into the Chamber, &s;earches all Cham|bers for her, runs from one place to another, peeps in every hole,
<PB N="28" REF="21">and corner, but finds nothing but a Paper that lay upon the Table, in which there was writ; that &s;he being not able to endure the af|fronts and reproaches, with which he had threatned her, he &s;hould not take it ill, that &s;he had ab&s;ented her &s;elf for &s;ome time, only till his anger was over, and that he had alter'd his re&s;olutions; for &s;he could not imagin, that her endea|vouring to relea&s;e an innocent di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Gentleman, was &s;uch a Crime as de&s;erv'd &s;o &s;evere a u&s;age, as he de&s;ign'd her. Though he was a Per&s;on that naturally had a great power over his pa&s;&s;ions, yet feeing him&s;elf over-reach'd by a Woman, he fell into &s;uch a rage, that &s;torming, and threatning all the Servants, as being acce&s;&s;aries to her flight, they at la&s;t went their ways and left him alone to vent his anger at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t tran&s;ports were o|ver, he began more calmly to
<PB N="29" REF="21">con&s;ider with him&s;elf, what he had be&s;t to do, and what cour&s;e to take to retrieve this fugitive Woman. Being vex'd with him&s;elf for hav|ing expre&s;s'd &s;o much pa&s;&s;ion before his Servants, and publi&s;hed &s;o much of his concerns, but as to that, there was no remedy, and all that was to be done now, was how to get his Wife home again; but fir&s;t how and where to meet with her. This he knew not how to go about, having not the lea&s;t knowledge of the cour&s;e that &s;he had &s;tear'd, he re&s;olves a thou&s;and things in his mind, and as often defeats them a|gain with new con&s;iderations, not knowing on which to pitch: Some|times he is for one expedient, then pre&s;ently again he layes that by, and he takes up another; &s;ometimes he is of opinion that it is the wicked Father <HI>Andrew</HI> that has a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Wife in her e&s;cape, at other times he is of opinion, that it is the Pil|grim, who not obeying his orders,
<PB N="30" REF="22">had lain lurking thereabout to ac|compli&s;h this wicked bu&s;ine&s;s, then &s;ometimes he was in the belief, that they both had a hand in the Plot: Thus being perplex'd with divers uncertainties, not knowing what cour&s;e to take, he goes to the window which had been left open, where he finds &s;ome certain marks of his Wifes e&s;cape that way, there he &s;ets him&s;elf down, and after a long debate within him&s;elf, he concludes that his wife imagining that the Pilgrim had followed the Marquio|ne&s;s to <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> &s;he had made what ha&s;t &s;he could with the Fryers a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, to go after him, and to gain him for her &s;elf, before that he had time to renew his friend&s;hip with the Marquione&s;s. Among&s;t a thou|&s;and conceptions finding this the mo&s;t probable; he re&s;olves for <HI>Sa|rago&s;&s;a</HI> immediately; but receiving that day &s;ome orders, which requi|red his pre&s;ence for three days at <HI>Barcellonna,</HI> he was forc'd to obey, and defer his pur&s;uit till that bu&s;i|ne&s;s was over.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="22">
<P>Mean time our Travellers are come to Anchor before <HI>Narbona,</HI> the Ma&s;ter gives them notice of it; the Pilgrim appears fir&s;t upon the Deck, trembling at the very thoughts of approaching and di&s;co|vering his deceit to the Lady: He had been there &s;ome time, when one came to him to tell him, that the Lady would have him come to her, in her Cabin. The Pilgrim with much perplexity and di&s;order did obey the Commands.</P>
<P><HI>Donna Barbara,</HI> had made the place as ob&s;cure as &s;he could, to prevent a &s;urpri&s;al, de&s;iring to di&s;|cover her &s;elf to <HI>Camille</HI> little by little, and to obtain his pardon for the change that &s;he had put up|on him; after which &s;he would en|deavour to gain his affections. The Pilgrim comes in, and with much ado feeling out the Bed that the La|dy lay on; he throws him&s;elf on his knees by the Bed &s;ide, and was going to ask pardon for his pre|&s;umption;
<PB N="32" REF="23">when <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> did interrupt him in this manner, <HI>Sir, there is no Woman in the World who having received &s;o great a fa|vour as I have lately from you, but would acknowledge her &s;elf infinite|ly oblig'd unto your generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance for it; yet, Sir, the ca&s;e is &s;uch at pre&s;ent, that I mu&s;t attribute the cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent liberty, more to my good Fortune, than to your endea|vours, when I look upon all that you have olately done, as intended to &s;ome other per&s;on than my &s;elf. Madam,</HI> replyed the Pilgrim, <HI>I am come to acknowledge my Crime, and mo&s;t humbly beg your pardon, for having been &s;o bold, as to take upon me the performance of that which was de|&s;ign'd for a worthier hand, than that of a mi&s;erable Pilgrim; and I do own my &s;elf &s;o unworthy that honour, that I mu&s;t wholly attribute to my good Fortune that happine&s;s, which ano|ther more worthy might de&s;ervedly challenge from his own merits,
<PB N="33" REF="23">You cannot be wanting in that,</HI> re|plyed <HI>Donna Barbara, except it be that your Cruelty, does drown with ingratitude, all tho&s;e advantages and excellencies that the Heavens have &s;o profu&s;ely &s;howred upon you, and in that lyes my mi&s;ery, that while you are endeavouring to oblige ano|ther; you &s;et forth your unnkind|ne&s;s to me, and are per&s;uading me to believe, how ready and willing you are to &s;erve others, while I am to be left unregarded, or that if you chance to do me &s;ome kind Office, it is again&s;t your will, and by meer accident. Madam,</HI> replyed the Pil|grim, <HI>&s;ince it has pleas'd the Fates to make me by accident that in&s;tru|ment of your &s;afety, which your judicious choice had de&s;ign'd unto ano|ther, be pleas'd to allow of their de|termination, and to accept of my mo&s;t humble Services, in order to your future de&s;igns.</HI> This unex|pected an&s;wer did &s;o &s;urprize <HI>Don|na Barbara,</HI> that &s;he remained for
<PB N="34" REF="24">&s;ome time without an&s;wering, which gave the Pilgrim time to add; I am the more excu&s;able, Madam, in having undertaken no|thing but what I had your com|mands for, under your own hand, wherein reading your re&s;olutions &amp; fearing that my receiving of your orders might probably di&s;appoint tho&s;e per&s;ons for whom they were mant, by which you would loo&s;e that opportunity which might ne|ver be recovered again. I thought that I could do no le&s;s than &s;upply that place, which I have done, but in order to &s;erve you; Madam, if you think fit to make any further u&s;e of me, I am ready to obey you in what el&s;e you will be pleas'd to command me, but if my un|worthine&s;s does invite you to ca&s;t me off, let me but have the happi|ne&s;s to accompli&s;h the re&s;idue of my Pilgrimage under the favourable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and recommendation of your illu&s;trious Name; and I &s;hall re&s;t contented with the hon|our

<P>The Pilgrim received <HI>Donna Bar|bara</HI>'s orders with much earne&s;t|ne&s;s, and her Gold with as much greedine&s;s; and having a&s;&s;ured her that he would make all the ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible, he went to &s;hore, where he provided all things nece&s;&s;ary for her conveyance to the place that &s;he de&s;ired, and return'd to her again at the clo&s;e of the Evening giving her an account of what he had done; pre&s;ently after the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;|&s;el was pay'd for his freight, and <HI>Don|ua Barbara</HI> was conducted to &s;hore by the Pilgrim, from whence they were convey'd ince&s;&s;antly to <HI>Sarago&s;|&s;a.</HI> At the la&s;t days journey &s;he &s;ent her new Servant before to provide

<P>So &s;oon as <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> found her &s;elf to have no further occa&s;ion of the Pilgrim, &s;he gave him a ve|ry con&s;iderable gratuity for his Ser|vices, and returning him thanks &s;he &s;ent him away.</P>
<P>Our Pilgrim being flu&s;h'd with what he had receiv'd for his four or five days Services, went to &s;eek for a lodging for him&s;elf; he had quickly found one at a publick Hou&s;e, where he met al&s;o with &s;ome of his Country-men, with whom having made acquaintance, they &s;upp'd together at the Pil|grims co&s;t, who would treat them,
<PB N="38" REF="26">and after Supper, they fell a drinking &s;o hard. that they were all in their Altitudes, e&s;pecially our Pilgrim, who being puff'd up with the hon|nour which he had receiv'd in &s;er|ving a Marquione&s;s, and in that gallant manner too, be&s;ides, the thought which came into his head, of the great reward which he had receiv'd for it; that no|thing would &s;erve his turn at la&s;t, but the Marquione&s;s's Health, which he began with a full brimmer; which Health he oblig'd the company to pledge, twice over; one among&s;t them being &s;omewhat more peevi&s;h than the re&s;t, had not &s;o much Complai&s;ance, as to do it without grumbling; and among&s;t the re&s;t of his mutterings, he &s;aid, why mu&s;t we drink twice' over a Womans Health, who&s;e name we know not? Nay, nor I neither, replyed the Pilgrim; but thus much I will tell you, to invite you to it; that &s;he is young, beautiful, wi&s;e, and as generous as a Prince&s;s, and

<P>At la&s;t they drank &s;o long, that they were all pa&s;t drinking, and it was &s;o late, that the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e came and de&s;ired the Com|pany to get to their Beds, if they could find them, for that Night, telling them that the next day would be long enough for them to &s;ing the Second part to the &s;ame Tune, if they pleas'd: With that our brave Pilgrim having di&s;charg'd the reckoning, was led into his

<P>The next morning one of the Marque&s;&s;es Servants coming at that Hou&s;e to vi&s;it one that had lately been his fellow Servant, he is infor|med of a certain Pilgrim newly come from <HI>Barcellonna,</HI> who had talk'd much of a Marquione&s;s, and that he had drank her Health, with &s;ome of his own Country-men, till they were pa&s;t drinking for that bout.

<P>While things were in this po|&s;ture at the City of <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a.

To this purpo&s;e the Landlord is call'd up, and employ'd to go and learn ex|actly where tho&s;e per&s;ons lay, and pre&s;ently after returns with full In|formation; upon which <HI>Camille</HI> and the Father take their mea&s;ures. They having debated and conclu|ded on &s;ome thing: Father <HI>Andrew</HI> is &s;ent to go take private lodgings near that place, but as he goes down Stairs he meets with his Ho&s;t whom he takes along with him, to &s;hew him the Hou&s;e wherein the Marquione&s;s lay. The Father ha|ving taken good notice of it, &s;ends back mine Ho&s;t, and takes lodgings clo&s;e by it; after which returning to <HI>Camille,</HI> he gave him an account of what he had done, and pre&s;ent|ly they caus'd their goods to be re|mov'd. They being in their new lodgings; the next thing which was thought on was, that Father <HI>Andrew</HI> &s;hould in&s;inuate him&s;elf
<PB N="45" REF="29">into the Company of the Marque&s;s his Landlord, to learn of him how things were, that was pre&s;ently done; and in a &s;hort time the good Father was inform'd, that he did not know what per&s;ons liv'd in his Hou&s;e, nor how many they were that he had never &s;een any of them, but one Maid Servant; that if they were &s;uch great per&s;ons, as had been reported, they had doubtle&s;s for &s;ome great rea&s;on and de&s;ign, left their retinue behind them, and liv'd extraordinarily retired, never &s;tirring out of their Chamber, where all their nece&s;&s;aries were brought to them, by that only Maid: The Father having been thus far inform|ed, enquired, if it were not po&s;&s;ible to have a Letter delivered unto the Marquione&s;s, unknown to her Husband? He was an&s;wer|ed, that he did not know whither there was a Husband or no in the ca&s;e, and did believe that if &s;he had one he was not with her at that
<PB N="46" REF="30">time. With that a maid going by, here is their Servant, continued he, I will call her to you, and &s;he &s;hall inform you her &s;elf of that better than I can. He call'd the Maid, who being come, Father <HI>Andrew</HI> inquired of her, wehther the Mar|que&s;s was with his Lady, and if it were not po&s;&s;ible to give her a Let|ter without his knowledge, to which all the an&s;wer that he could get was, that &s;he was not yet &s;o weary of her place, is to loo&s;e it, that &s;he lik'd it &s;o well, as to have no de&s;ire to part with it to another; that &s;he knew well enough what &s;he had to do, and that he &s;hould mind his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and not go about to get her place from her; and having &s;aid this &s;he went away, with a great deal of indignation. The good Father found by this &s;mall Tryall that no good was to be expected that way, he therefore be|thought him&s;elf of another expedi|ent, and with fair words and pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="47" REF="30">did require of the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e that he would lend him the Key of his Garden door that at night he might get into it, where he made no que&s;tion but by &s;ome means or other, he would find out &s;ome way to let the Lady know of his being there, which &s;he would be very glad to hear. The Landlord making &s;ome doubts at it, preten|ding that he might by that means loo&s;e his Lodgers, the ingenious Father did pre&s;ently remove tho&s;e &s;cruples, in dropping in his hand a Pi&s;tol or two, which put the Key of the Garden Door into his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. The good Father would willingly have been fully inform'd, whether the Marque&s;s was with his Wife or not; but after divers at|tempts, and to no purpo&s;e, he went home, being per&s;uaded by divers circum&s;tances that he was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>Being returned home, he in|form'd <HI>Camille</HI> of all that he had done, telling him that it were his
<PB N="48" REF="31">own fault if he got not the Lady immediately, while her Husband was ab&s;ent. <HI>How do you know that he is ab&s;ent?</HI> replyed <HI>Camille, as for my part I am not very well a&s;&s;ured that this is the right Marquione&s;s, and I fear lea&s;t you may mi&s;take in this, as when you took the Moor for</HI> Donna Barbara. To which Father <HI>Andrew</HI> &s;aid, <HI>give me leave to tell you &s;ome circum&s;tances and to put &s;ome con&s;equences into your head, and then judge whether it can be any o|ther per&s;on than the Marquione&s;s. They are lately come hither from</HI> Bar|cellonna, <HI>where they are very pri|vate; as to their being with no other Servant than one &s;ingle Maid, thus I make it out, thus I make it out; the Marque&s;s having it is probable &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which call'd him from hence, and fearing, lea&s;t in his ab|&s;ence you &s;hould clear your &s;elf to the Governour of</HI> Barcelonna <HI>&s;o as to be releas'd pre&s;ently after, and that you might follow after him, he to
<PB N="49" REF="31">conceal his Wife from your knowledge, had left his retinue at &s;ome &s;mall di|&s;tance from the City; and to make the le&s;s noi&s;e, had brought his Wife in the night, only accompanied with her two Guardian Women, and that &s;erving Maid who was to attend them, with charge never to &s;tir forth of her Chamber till his return, after which he might return to his Servants, and take them along with him.</HI> This is the be&s;t way that he could take in &s;uch a ca&s;e, replyed <HI>Camille,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, were he forc'd upon &s;ome &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;ion, to have left his Wife behind him; but I fear that nothing, could per|&s;uade him to do &s;o: Yes, replyed Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> for &s;ome few days, having &s;uch tru&s;ty Guardians to watch over her, and having mewd her up &s;o clo&s;e, as no body but him&s;elf could find her again, at lea&s;t in his thoughts; Be&s;ides, why may &s;he not be fallen &s;ick? At lea&s;t not &s;o well, as to be carried, with &s;o
<PB N="50" REF="32">much ha&s;t as his bu&s;ine&s;s might re|quire? and &s;o be forc'd to leave her behind? All the&s;e are conje|ctures and probabilities: It may, and it may not be &s;o, replyed <HI>Ca|mille,</HI> and neither you nor I can in|form our &s;elves better: Well, put the Ca&s;e we are in the right, what is next to be done, continued <HI>Ca|mille?</HI> This, reply'd the Fryer; you mu&s;t have a Letter in readi|ne&s;s for her; you mu&s;t be&s;ides make &s;ome kind of Song or Ver&s;es, which you may Sing at night under her Window, in which you mu&s;t give her to under&s;tand in covered terms, that you are here in order to re|ceive her commands: The con&s;e|quence of this, replyed <HI>Camille,</HI> will be, that we &s;hall alarm her Guardians, who will reward us with the &s;ame pre&s;ents as the Mar|que&s;s receiv'd at <HI>Barcellonna;</HI> and that at the Marque&s;s his return, they will inform him of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="51" REF="32">and &s;o our de&s;ign will be lo&s;t, and all hopes of &s;etting on foot any other by our di&s;covery. To this I an&s;wer, reply'd the Father, that you mu&s;t not mention any thing that can be under&s;tood, but by the Marchione&s;s her &s;elf; that though the Guardians are awakned, we &s;hall find &s;ome way to convey the Letter privately to the Mar|chione&s;s, and that we &s;hall after that, through her own a&s;&s;i&s;tance, get her off before the Marque&s;s his return. Well, reply'd <HI>Camille,</HI> it is but the venturing of a &s;uit of Cloaths and my Theorbo, I will give you the &s;atisfaction of going with you at night, and to that pur|po&s;e I will go about the Letter and the Ver&s;es.</P>
<P>At night <HI>Camille,</HI> and Father <HI>Andrew</HI> came to the Garden door of the Marchione&s;&s;es Lodgings, the Father goes to open it, but af|ter he had fumbled a good while without &s;ucce&s;s, they were forc'd to
<PB N="52" REF="33">leave the Key in the Lock, and to get into the Garden over the Wall, where <HI>Camille</HI> began to tune his In&s;trument at a di&s;tance, which done, he afterwards drew nearer and Sang: He had not proceeded far, when the Hou&s;e door, that came into the Garden was &s;uddenly thru&s;t open; at which, <HI>Camille</HI> &s;tep'd a&s;ide behind a Statue, pre|&s;ently came out running with their Swords in hand, three per|&s;ons, very furiou&s;ly, which made the good Father to make towards the place that he had come in at, where by the advantage of a Ter|race walk, he nimbly got over the Walk into a back Street, and from thence immediately home. The pur&s;uers finding the Garden door lock'd; they &s;ought up and down the Garden after their prey, which gave time to <HI>Camille</HI> to remove his Station; he was pa&s;&s;ing cro&s;s the walk, clo&s;e by the door of the Hou&s;e; when a Woman taking
<PB N="53" REF="33">him by the hand, come follow me, &s;aid &s;he, I will put you out at the Street Door and go along with you; though I am not &s;o well pro|vided now, as I would have been, had you but &s;tay'd till to morrow night; with that &s;he led him out by the Street-door, where &s;he thus continued to &s;peak. It fell out ve|ry ill, that my Brothers &s;hould be &s;o unluckily awakened by the &s;inging at the next Neighbours, under the new comers window, as I imagin: I hope, <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> that you are, and will be &s;en&s;ible of what I do for you; How that I abandon all other intere&s;ts, to fol|low you; and now that I have put my &s;elf into your hands, even before you could expect it, and when you did intend nothing more than a private vi&s;it to me, I hope that you will deal generou&s;ly by me, and faithfully perform all your vows and prote&s;tations to me; in order to which I de&s;ire you
<PB N="54" REF="34">to convey me pre&s;ently to your own hou&s;e, or any where el&s;e, if you think us not &s;afe there from my Brothers &s;earch after us, and there to Marry me out of hand; that being once done you may claim me as your own, which will very much allay that pro&s;ecution, which otherwi&s;e we might expect with all the &s;everity imaginable from my in&s;enced Brothers. Ha|ving &s;aid this, &s;he made a pau&s;e, as expecting his an&s;wer. Which having not, what is the matter? continued &s;he, that you an&s;wer me not? Do you think me too for|ward in this Juncture, or do you re|lent in your affections? &s;aying this, &s;he held back <HI>Camille,</HI> who was &s;till going a round pace, he knew not where; I will be &s;atisfied continu|ed &s;he, before I go a &s;tep further. <HI>Camille</HI> then &s;eeing a nece&s;&s;ity of undeceiving that per&s;on, he led her towards the middle of the Street, where there was a little more light,
<PB N="55" REF="34">and lifting up his head, he gave her time and opportunity to &s;ee her mi&s;take, by looking in his Face. So &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw <HI>Camille,</HI> making a great &s;hreik, &s;he endeavour'd to &s;natch her hand out of his, and would have gone from him; when <HI>Camille</HI> finding that it was time for him to &s;peak, &s;aid, Madam, be not &s;o affrighted as you are; but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf that you are fallen into the hands of a Gentleman, who though a &s;tranger in the&s;e parts, will &s;erve and protect you with his Life, from any danger what&s;oever; be pleas'd but to re|collect your &s;elf a little, continu|ed he, finding that &s;he did &s;till en|deavour to get away; and ca&s;t not your &s;elf into unnece&s;&s;ary inconve|niencies by your needle&s;s appre|hen&s;ions; do but command me, let me but know what is mo&s;t ex|pedient that I &s;hould do for you at pre&s;ent, and you will find, that I &s;hall obey with all the re&s;pects and
<PB N="56" REF="35">diligence imaginable. The&s;e words being delivered by <HI>Camille,</HI> with an accent and grace, which did &s;peak him what he was, did &s;omewhat &s;ettle again the trem|bling Lady, who took the boldne&s;s to &s;ay, Sir, if in my late misfor|tune I have had &s;o much happine&s;s as to fall into the hands of a Gen|tleman, that will not make u&s;e of the advantages that my mi&s;take and the darkne&s;s of the Night has given him; &s;hew your &s;elf &s;uch, by immediately bring me back to that place, where I fir&s;t did meet with you. That were not to &s;erve you, replyed <HI>Camille,</HI> but rather to pro&s;titute you, to your Enemy's Fury. Therefore, rather inform me, Madam, where I may convey you into the hands of that per&s;on, for whom you took me, who without que&s;tion, will glad ly receive you into his protection. If I am &s;o happy, reply'd the La|dy, as to have met with &s;o gene|rous
<PB N="57" REF="35">a per&s;on; I &s;hall be oblig'd to return my thanks to Heaven, for having &s;ent me in &s;uch an extremi|ty, &s;o favourable an a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I might not have expected from tho&s;e of my own Nation, had I been &s;o unfortunate as to have fallen in any of their Hands, with all the&s;e di&s;advantages. You loo&s;e time. Madam, reply'd <HI>Camille,</HI> and know not how &s;oon you may be overtaken and &s;urpriz'd; I have already declared to you, that I am not of this Nation, and I add to it, that though my lodgings are not far from this place, I neither know where I am at pre&s;ent, nor which way to retrieve them, and did I know, I &s;hould not go about to do it till I had left you &s;afe, where you de&s;ire to be; therefore I once more humbly intreat you, Madam, to guide me where you would have me to conduct you: You &s;ee, continued <HI>Camille,</HI> that day be|gins to break, and &s;hould you be found at this time of the night in
<PB N="58" REF="36">the open Streets with a man, you may gue&s;s at the dangerous con|&s;equences. I know not where to go, replyed the Lady, for I am ignorant of <HI>Don Alphon&s;o</HI>'s Hou&s;e, therefore I mu&s;t intreat you to lead me any where, till I have the op|portunity to &s;end to him to come to me. <HI>Camille</HI> was going to reply, when he perceiv'd a man coming in ha&s;t towards them, who &s;aid, Sir, if you are a Gentleman, pray a&s;&s;i&s;t me again&s;t the odds that my Enemies have over me, at this the Gentlewoman knowing by his voice that it was her Friend: Oh! my <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> cry'd &s;he, running to|wards him: Here is a Gentle|man, continued &s;he, looking on <HI>Camille,</HI> that the Heavens have &s;ent on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. This did &s;omewhat calm the jealous <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Who began to look &s;ourly upon that per&s;on, whom he had found in private with his Mi&s;tre&s;s; but pre|&s;ently the Ladies Brothers com|ing up, with their Swords drawn,
<PB N="59" REF="36">they cryed here he is, which interrupted their further di&s;cour&s;e, by falling upon <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> which made <HI>Camille</HI> to draw likewi&s;e, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the weake&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>The cla&s;hing of the Swords did pre&s;ently call &s;ome of the watch to them, before any hurt was done, which made every one &s;hift for him&s;elf, by good fortune the Watch following the three Bro|thers; they gave time to the o|thers to get off. But they not find|ing the Lady where they had left her, nor no where thereabouts, they went to &s;earch a little further, where <HI>Camille</HI> found him&s;elf ju&s;t before his own door, meeting there with Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> who had the Lady by the hand; he being impa|tient at <HI>Camille</HI>'s ab&s;ence had gone out with a de&s;ign to &s;eek after him, and pa&s;&s;ing by ju&s;t when they were fighting, and perceiving a Lady &s;tanding by, much affrigh|ted, taking her to be the Marchio|ne&s;s, he had led her toward his Lodg|ings,
<PB N="60" REF="37">and &s;he being &s;o &s;urpriz'd at the &s;ight of her Brothers, had given her hand to the fir&s;t comer, with|out con&s;idering who it was. They were all very glad to meet &s;o lucki|ly in that place: <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> told <HI>Ca|mille,</HI> that he was infinitely ob|lig'd to him for his generous a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, without which he mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have fallen under the di&s;advantage of his Enemies Swords. Sir, reply'd <HI>Camille,</HI> this is no place to u&s;e compliments in, and I judg it dangerous for you both to appear any more in the Streets this Night, while your Brothers are yet in the pur&s;uit of you. Neither would it be &s;afe for us to retire to my Hou&s;e yet, &s;aid <HI>Alphon&s;o:</HI> You &s;ay right, an&s;wer'd <HI>Camille,</HI> therefore if you plea&s;e to accept of what accomodation my Lodgings and the hou&s;e will afford, you &s;hall find there a hearty well|come, where you may remain &s;afe, and as private as you plea&s;e, till you
<PB N="61" REF="37">have the lei&s;ure and conveniency to retire your &s;elves where-el&s;e you &s;hall think fit. <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> having return'd <HI>Camille</HI> humble thanks, turning to the Lady, Madam, &s;aid he, &s;ince it is dangerous in having you any further this night, lea&s;t that you &s;hould fall again into the hands of your Brothers, if you plea&s;e, we will be further ingaged unto this gallant per&s;on, in accep|ting of his kind offers; at which the Lady made an&s;wer, I am wil|ling to accept of this Gentlemans Civilities; but it &s;hall be upon condition that you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;end for a Prie&s;t to Marry us: re|plyed the Lady, and you, Sir, con|tinued &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to <HI>Camille,</HI> you &s;hall ingage to me be|fore I enter, that you will do me the favour to give me to this Gen|tleman; he knows what a con&s;ide|rable Fortune I bring along with me, in &s;pight of my Brothers, able to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his broken Fortune;
<PB N="62" REF="38">and when once my Brothers know that I am his by Marriage, they will lay a&s;ide their anger, and de|&s;i&s;t any further pro&s;ecutions. <HI>Ca|mille</HI> and <HI>Don Alphon&s;o</HI> having pro|mis'd that &s;he &s;hould have all the &s;atisfaction that &s;he &s;hould require; they went up Stairs, where, while the Prie&s;t was &s;ent for, and a Cham|ber getting ready for them, <HI>Camil|le</HI> gave them the be&s;t entertain|ment that he could; and an ac|count of his Amours, and of the cau&s;e of all the di&s;orders of that Night, through the Song, which he had applyed in a wrong place. After his, <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> and <HI>Camille</HI> renewed their Compliments, with a&s;&s;urances of &s;ervices on either &s;ide, and &s;o they contracted a Friend&s;hip, which prov'd more du|rable than is u&s;ual between a <HI>Spani|ard</HI> and an <HI>Italian;</HI> after a while the Prie&s;t being come, they were Married, and then they retired in|to that Chamber that had been fit|ted
<PB N="63" REF="38">for them, where <HI>Camille</HI> having conducted them, he took his leave and left them, to go to his own Bed, and pre&s;ently after Father <HI>An|drew</HI> did the like.</P>
<P>The next morning the good Fa|ther, who was always diligent in &s;uch affairs, goes to the Marque&s;s his Landlord again, and telling him that he had been di&s;appointed by intangling the Key with other things in his Pocket, which pulling out, he had dropp'd and could not find again: That he de&s;ired him to get another made; and giving the man a double Pi&s;tol, to &s;top all re|plies and put offs, here is to pay for it continued he, I &s;hall come again in the Evening, therefore pray let it be ready again&s;t then: The Landlord was going to reply with a &s;our Face, as if he did not like it, and had no mind to get another Key: But the cunning Father per|ceiving it: It may be that it will co&s;t more. Y'are in the right, continued
<PB N="64" REF="39">he, and giving him another Pi&s;tol, if that will not do, I will bring you more when I come to fetch it; at this the Landlord being overcome, he did promi&s;e him to get a Key ready again&s;t Evening.</P>
<P>By that time that Father <HI>Andrew</HI> was return'd, <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> and his La|dy were vi&s;ited by <HI>Camille,</HI> they de&s;ired him to let them have a Me&s;&s;enger to &s;end to <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI>'s Hou&s;e for &s;ome of his Servants to come to him; it was done accor|dingly; and <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> having writ &s;ome Letters to &s;ome of his parti|cular Friends, inviting them to come and accompany him and his Bride home; he &s;ent one of his own Servants with them, and &s;ent ano|ther home, to give order that all things &s;hould be got in a readine&s;s fit to receive him and his Friends; not long after, there came divers of the new married couples Friends to of|fer their Services: To whom <HI>Don Alphon&s;o</HI> and his Lady returning

<PB N="68" REF="41">pa&s;s it in framing a thou&s;and agree|ble Ideas in his fancy, about the Charming entertainment; and he was in &s;uch a Rapture all the day following at the thoughts of the plea&s;ures, which he was e're long to enjoy, that he could neither eat nor drink, being &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;t with tho&s;e joys, which he already did reli&s;h in his imagination. At la&s;t did come the happy hour, he flyes into his bli&s;s, being at the Garden door, where he leaves Fa|ther <HI>Andrew</HI> to return home, he is met by a Servant Maid, who does conduct him to the Chamber, his pa&s;&s;ion is rais'd to &s;uch a height, at each &s;tep that he makes towards it, that he endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s it with the apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome re|ver&s;e of Fortune, for fear that his exce&s;s &s;hould tran&s;port him beyond him&s;elf; he arrives at la&s;t to the Chamber door, he enters, he per|ceives the Lady in an ob&s;cure place
<PB N="69" REF="41">at the further end of the Chamber, he runs towards her, flings him&s;elf at her feet, and with a voice that expre&s;s'd the tran&s;ports of his Soul, he &s;ays, <HI>Madam, what honour do I receive in this your gracious conde|&s;cention to my humble de&s;ires? My Soul is &s;o tran&s;ported at the &s;ingular favours which I now enjoy from your extream bounty, that I want words to expre&s;s my re&s;entments; let therefore my &s;ilence, my re&s;pects, and my mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;peak to you what my Tongue cannot utter.

He ri&s;es, and being &s;truck dumb, he remains as motionle&s;s as a Statue, which gave time to <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> to expre&s;s her re&s;entments after this manner. <HI>Thou the mo&s;t ungrate|ful, and the unworthie&s;t of all men; have I abandoned my honour to the cen&s;ure of the whole world? have I for&s;aken an Husband, and all other in|tere&s;ts, to come after thee? and is it thus that thou requite&s;t me?

<PB N="73" REF="43">with her my former affections, and if&mdash;Here <HI>Donna Barbara</HI> inter|rupted him, &s;aying: But here I am, where in &s;pight of all oppo&s;iti|ons, contemning all dangers, and treading all other con&s;iderations under feet; I am come in pur&s;uit of the mo&s;t ungrateful of men; but if I mu&s;t peri&s;h, I will fir&s;t break your mea&s;ures, and have the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee my Rival depriv'd of all hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that which is refus'd unto my affections.

<P>In the morning Father <HI>Andrew</HI> goes to the great Church, where after &s;ome time he &s;ees the Marque&s;s come in; he waits behind a Pillar, till he had fini&s;h'd his devotions, and then traces him home, and now what's to be done, but to return to <HI>Camille,</HI> and give him an account of the di&s;covery, and con&s;ult toge|ther, how to inform &s;peedily the Marchione&s;s of their being at <HI>Sara|go&s;&s;a,</HI> becau&s;e that other ways <HI>Donna Barbara</HI>'s expectations from <HI>Camille</HI> might &s;poil all, if not an|&s;wered according to her de&s;ires.

No &s;ooner concluded but executed, and while the one is dre&s;&s;ing up like a very neat old Wo|man, to which the withered beard|le&s;s Face, did not a little contri|bute, the other was writing a Note which was to be &s;ecretly convey'd to the Marchione&s;s. The Father is fitted with all nece&s;&s;aries, the Note is convey'd very &s;mooth into a Glove, and the brisk old Woman, being in a perfect readine&s;s, goes to the Marque&s;s Hou&s;e: She meets with a Servant, of whom &s;he inquires if &s;he can be admitted with her Ware to the Marchione&s;s. <HI>I have &s;uch choice of curious things,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>as I am &s;ure will plea&s;e her very well.

In this re&s;olution &s;he begins to retire, when the Marque&s;s coming by from his Wifes Chamber, he enquires what that Woman would have. It was now time to put on a good Face, nothing but the height of confi|dence with a good courage can car|ry off the old Woman, therefore &s;he briskly an&s;wers; that &s;he was come to &s;hew the Marchione&s;s &s;ome

The Marque&s;s enters his Wifes Chamber, and tells her that he had brought her a woman with &s;ome things, of which he would have her make choice.

<P>Mean while, diligent Father <HI>An|drew,</HI> who was always upon the watch, having had an account of all that had pa&s;s'd, and not hearing a word mention'd of <HI>Camille,</HI> who was not return'd to his Lodgings, he concluded that he had hid him|&s;elf in <HI>Donna Barbara</HI>'s Chamber, whence he dur&s;t not adventure forth, &s;o long as the Governour &s;hould be there; he ponders within him&s;elf, what he had be&s;t to do for his deliverance, before the time of the Night were come, that they were to repair under the Marchio|ne&s;&s;es Window in the Garden, he
<PB N="93" REF="53">returns to his Lodgings the better to contrive the bu&s;ine&s;s. A little after there came a Me&s;&s;enger from the Pri&s;on, with a Letter directed to the Marchione&s;s, without a name, lodging in &s;uch a Street. When the Marque&s;s had caus'd the Pilgrim to be committed, he had given charge, that in ca&s;e the Pri&s;oner &s;hould de&s;ire Pen and Ink, that it &s;hould be granted to him, but that what&s;oever he &s;hould write to be &s;ent forth, &s;hould be immediatly brought to him: This had been done accordingly; but the Me&s;&s;en|ger being at the Marque&s;s's Hou&s;e, had been &s;ent here after him. The Marque&s;s having receiv'd it, open'd it, and read as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>WHen I was fir&s;t committed, I made no doubt but that you would take &s;ome care for my immedi|ate relea&s;e; the want of which makes me now trouble you with the&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="54">lines, to let you know, that notwith|&s;tanding the late favours that you were pleas'd to be&s;tow on me, I am become one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Crea|tures imaginable; for though through your generous bounty, I have wherewith to keep me from pre&s;ent want, yet the lo&s;s of my Liberty is &s;uch a Mi&s;ery, as cannot be expre&s;s'd. Seeing that it was in your Service that I got this affliction, I humbly in|treat you to endeavour forthwith my Enlargement, and to take me from &s;uffering under tho&s;e &s;ad effects of your Jealous Husband's too &s;evere hand, without which I &s;hall quickly be in my Grave, by which means you will lo&s;e the mo&s;t humble&s;t of your Servants.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being read, the Mar|que&s;s and the Governour could not but admire at once, both the &s;impli|city and impudence of this Pilgrim; yet the Governour did take notice, that this was not writ in &s;uch a &s;tile
<PB N="95" REF="54">as the Pilgrim us'd to expre&s;s him|&s;elf when he was at <HI>Barcellonna.</HI> The Marque&s;s made an&s;wer, That it was probable that his impri&s;on|ment, and the thwarting of his de|&s;igns, without hops of redre&s;s, had render'd him &s;o melancholick as to di&s;compo&s;e his mind. While they were thus &s;pending their Verdict and de&s;canting on the Pilgrims Let|ter, there was another brought to the Marque&s;s, which having open'd, he read as follows.</P>

<P><HI>THere is a Fryer of St.</HI> Domi|nicks <HI>Order here, who is very importunate to &s;peak with the Pil|grim, and will not be deny'd; not|with&s;tanding his Character, I would not give him admittance to the Pri&s;o|ner without your order: I have in|quired his name, which he was very unwilling to di&s;cover; yet in hopes to &s;peak with the Pilgrim, he has told me that he is call'd Father</HI> Andrew,

</LETTER>
<P>This la&s;t Letter did &s;o &s;urprize them both, that looking on one another, they remain'd mute; at la&s;t the Governour &s;aid, that they ought not to let &s;lip &s;o fair an op|portunity, of puni&s;hing their Wives diligent Mercury. No, no, reply'd the Marque&s;s, that would be a great over-&s;ight, I will immediately go to the Pri&s;on and have him &s;eis'd on, and I will along with you, &s;aid the Governour; for I long to &s;ee how &s;trangely he will be &s;urpriz'd at the &s;ight of us: Thus you &s;ee, reply'd the Marque&s;s, that the wicked &s;eek their own ruin, and bring them|&s;elves to receive the puni&s;hment due to their offences. Well, reply'd the Governour, now is the time to &s;e|cure both the&s;e wicked men, that
<PB N="97" REF="55">they &s;hall never more be in any Ca|pacity of debauching our Wives. Let's be going, reply'd the Mar|que&s;s, and lo&s;e no time, for fear he be gone before we come, and that we lo&s;e this fair opportunity of &s;eizing him: With that they did immediately take Coach to the o|ther end of the City, where was the Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner got out of the Hou&s;e, but the politick Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> of who&s;e contrivance the Letter was, came in, he goes up Stairs, and having ask'd which was the Chamber that belong'd to the Governour of <HI>Barcellonna;</HI> it was &s;hew'd him by one of the Guards, he draws near it, and is repul&s;ed, and told, that no body was to go in there: I know, reply'd the &s;ub|tle Father, that your Orders are to let no body in, but you are not hindred from letting any per&s;on go out, e&s;pecially when I am &s;ent on purpo&s;e by the Governour for
<PB N="98" REF="56">them. There is no body there, re|ply'd one of the Servants: It were &s;trange indeed, reply'd the Father, then they are gone out before I came for them, and yet I have made what ha&s;te I could from the Governour and the Marque&s;s; I came here directly, and have not met by the way, that Per&s;on that I come for: But I loo&s;e time, and the bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;&s;es. <HI>Signiour</HI> Ca|mille, continued he with a loud Voice, <HI>you mu&s;t leave off your watch|ing, for he that you wait for has been a Pri&s;oner the&s;e three days, and you mu&s;t immediately go along with me to the Governour, that &s;tays for you; come forth and I will deliver you my Errand punctually:</HI> This was &s;po|ken with &s;o much confidence by the Fryer, that the Servants pre|&s;ently open'd the Door, and forth came <HI>Camille; Now, Sir,</HI> continu|ed Father <HI>Andrew, I mu&s;t tell you that there is one Father</HI> Andrew <HI>at the Pri&s;on, that would &s;peak with the
<PB N="99" REF="56">Pilgrim Pri&s;oner; the Governour was going to &s;eize on him, but he has better con&s;ider'd on't, and therefore has &s;ent me for you, that you &s;hould go fir&s;t, and bring him certain word, whether it be that Per&s;on that he means, or not, whom he &s;ays you know very well.</HI> This did the good Father &s;peak with &s;o much readi|ne&s;s, that <HI>Camille</HI> him&s;elf was &s;tartled at it; and the Servants ha|ving heard the Governour and the Marque&s;s di&s;cour&s;e of it, before they went forth, they made no &s;cruple in the lea&s;t to let him go: <HI>Camille</HI> and the Fryer got home to their Lodgings, where they had lei&s;ure to recollect them&s;elves, to laugh at their Cullies Credulities, and to prepare again&s;t the time of going under the Marchione&s;&s;es Window.</P>
<P>Mean time the Governour and the Marque&s;s are carried with all the diligence po&s;&s;ible unto the Pri&s;on, contriving all the way how to pu|ni&s;h
<PB N="100" REF="57">this wicked and mo&s;t abomi|nable Fryer; at la&s;t they get thi|ther, and pre&s;ently inquire of the Keeper where was the Fryer. What Fryer do you mean, reply'd the Keeper? Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> reply'd the Marque&s;s ha|&s;tily; I hope you have not let him go, continued he? Never talk of that, &s;aid the Governour, where is he, where is he? What have you done with him? &s;aid the Marque&s;s. The Keeper amaz'd at their car|ne&s;t inquiries, &s;tood &s;taring &s;ome|time on one, &s;ome time on the other, without &s;aying a word. Pray, &s;ays the Governour to him, convey us where he is, and if you can, &s;o as that we may &s;ee him without di&s;|covering our &s;elves: Nay, it were much better, now I think on't, &s;aid the Marque&s;s, to place us &s;o as that we might hear him di&s;cour&s;e with the Pilgrim, and not be &s;een. Doubtle&s;s, replyed the Governour, but we &s;hould make &s;ome notable
<PB N="101" REF="57">di&s;coveries, and therefore go let him into the Pilgrim, while we &s;tay here till you come back to lead us where we may hear them. Let it be as of your own accord, &s;aid the Marque&s;s, and be quick, for I long to hear what new piece of Villany they are con&s;ulting of; at this they both pau&s;ing a while, wondring that the Keeper did not &s;tir, he had time to &s;ay, I a&s;&s;ure you, My Lord, that you have both &s;o &s;urpriz'd me, I know not what to think, much le&s;s what to &s;ay; neither do I &s;carce know where, or who I am; I have heard you all this while, &s;peak of a Fryer and a Pilgrim, but I know no more what you mean by it, than the Man in the Moon. Then rubbing of his Eyes, and yawning, Let me &s;ee, continu'd he, am I a&s;leep &s;till, or do I wake? Though I was &s;leep|ing when you came, certainly I am now awake, or how &s;hould I &s;tand thus el&s;e, continued he &s;trut|ting,
<PB N="102" REF="58">and &s;peak thus to you; nay, &s;ee and hear you too? And yet I do prote&s;t to you, that I know no|thing at all of any Fryers being here: At this the Marque&s;s &s;hew'd him the Letter, and &s;aid, did you not &s;end me this Letter, about half an hour &s;ince? Who I, &s;end a Letter, reply'd the Keeper? I was then dreaming of other things, I can a&s;&s;ure you, continued he; and I have neither writ, &s;ent, or &s;o much as thought of a Letter, this day, except that which I &s;ent you from the Pilgrim a while &s;ince; then look|ing on the Letter, which the Mar|que&s;s had given him; neither is this my hand writing, alas! I could never write a quarter &s;o well: This the Keepers &s;tory, made the Marque&s;s and the Governour, in their turn to be mute and look on one ano|ther; they concluded that this had been &s;ome trick of their Wives, not without &s;ome de&s;igns: As for mine, &s;aid the Governour, &s;he is
<PB N="103" REF="58">at pre&s;ent &s;afe enough from doing any mi&s;chief of that nature: And mine, &s;aid the Marque&s;s, has not had a Pen and Ink &s;ince I have Married her, except the Devil has &s;upply'd her with one of late; I ra|ther believe, that it is that cur&s;ed Fryer him&s;elf, that has thus &s;ham'd us: But to what purpo&s;e, reply'd the Governour? To nothing that is good, you may be certain, an|&s;wer'd the Marque&s;s; and for my part I will ha&s;ten home, where I think my pre&s;ence more nece&s;&s;ary than here; with that they took leave of one another, and went each to their own home.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Governour was return'd, he inquir'd of his Ser|vants who had been there, they an&s;wer'd him, no body, but the lit|tle ancient Gentleman whom he had &s;ent to fetch the other Gentle|man, that had been left in the Chamber to watch for the Pilgrim. How, &s;aid the Governour, a man
<PB N="104" REF="59">left in the Chamber to watch for the Pilgrim. How? &s;aid the Governour, a man left in the Chamber, and now gone out, while you two &s;tand at the Door and permit it? With that drawing his Sword, You Villains, continued he, I'll be the death of you both; how many were there to force him from you? What re|&s;i&s;tance have you made? And if you were over power'd, &s;hew me your wounds? Where is the blood that you have &s;pill'd in making op|po&s;ition? At the&s;e high words, both the poor Fellows, falling on their knees, gave him an exact account of the whole pa&s;&s;age, and with tears in their Eyes, ask'd him pardon for their Error. The Governour pre&s;ent|ly enter'd the Chamber, and while he was con&s;idering where this per&s;on could be hid, he was think|ing al&s;o who it &s;hould be; at la&s;t, he concluded that there was &s;ome great mi&s;take in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and did believe that the Marque&s;s had lighted on the wrong Pilgrim, who
<PB N="105" REF="59">he had &s;ecured while the damn'd right one had been hid in his Wives Chamber, whence his &s;pecial agent, that wicked Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> had got him out by framing of that Let|ter: This did &s;et him in &s;uch a rage, that he would not &s;o much as give the Marque&s;s an account of his thoughts, which he concluded to be certain; but the next morning early he went to the Mona&s;tery, whence having taken out his Wife, he return'd with her to <HI>Barcellonna,</HI> where he us'd her as he pleas'd.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s, all this while, had not been wanting in diligently inquiring of all the Servants, who had been there, and examining of the two Guardian Women, &s;o tor|menting them, that one of them nam'd <HI>Zora,</HI> being tyred out with his frivolous repeated que&s;tions, and fretting at his unrea&s;onable threat|ning of them, for letting his Wife have the conveniency of writing, &s;he knowing her &s;elf innocent, did at la&s;t tell the Marque&s;s, that there
<PB N="106" REF="60">was no Hell, like living with a Man &s;o &s;trangely jealous as he was, which did &s;et the Marque&s;s in &s;uch a fury, that he &s;truck her, which made her run into the Marchio|ne&s;&s;es Chamber with Tears in her Eyes: The Marchione&s;s as'kd what was the matter, to which <HI>Zora</HI> an&s;wered; That, Madam, which in a &s;hort time &s;hall turn to your advantage. The Marchione&s;s who had de&s;ign'd to &s;it up till the Mar|que&s;s was return'd, lea&s;t that he going his u&s;ual rounds before go|ing to Bed, &s;hould meet with the Letter, which his Wife did intend for <HI>Camille;</HI> hearing that the Mar|que&s;s was coming to bed, went and dropp'd the Letter, &s;o retiring, &s;he put her &s;elf in Bed; while the Marque&s;s was undre&s;&s;ing he did nothing but grumble, fret, and threaten, in a word, the fal&s;e Let|ter had &s;et him quite out of hu|mour.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="60">
<P>The hour come, which was a|bout the darke&s;t part of the Night, <HI>Camille</HI> got over the Wall with the active Father <HI>Andrew</HI> into the Gar|den; for though the good Father had no great bu&s;ine&s;s there, yet he lov'd &s;o well the &s;port, that <HI>Camille</HI> could not prevail with him to &s;tay at home: They were not got half way the walk, which led from the Garden Door to the Hou&s;e, when Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were always upon the watch, did per|ceive &s;omething that mov'd at the end of the other end; this put him to a &s;tand, and made him take <HI>Ca|mille</HI> by the arm, and hold him back: Stay, &s;aid he, I think I &s;ee &s;ome body that is waiting for us, let us retire while we can, for fear of a &s;urprize: <HI>Camille</HI> looking ear|ne&s;tly al&s;o, &s;aid, I do &s;ee &s;ome|thing move, but is not tall enough to be a man, and I rather believe that it is &s;ome Dog, which though not &s;o dangerous, may, I fear di&s;|cover
<PB N="108" REF="61">cus, and &s;poil our de&s;ign. Fa|ther <HI>Andrew</HI> was for a retreat, and <HI>Camille</HI> was for leaving the broad Walk, and &s;triking into the le&s;&s;er Allies to go round by the Wall &s;ide to di&s;cover what it were, without being perceiv'd; but the good Father having no inclination to venture any further, &s;aid, that he was &s;ure it was no Dog, and that he would &s;tay under the next Tree, while <HI>Camille</HI> &s;hould go make the di&s;covery. <HI>Ca|mille</HI> agreed to it, and went by the Wall &s;ide till he came near enough to di&s;tingui&s;h that it was a Monkey that had broke loo&s;e from &s;ome of the Neighbourhood, who having found the Letter that the Marchio|ne&s;s had thrown there, he had torn it open, and was playing with it. <HI>Camille</HI> was glad that it was no wor&s;e, yet knew not which way to go about to get the Letter from that little unlucky Creature; he was &s;till drawing nearer to him, when the Monkey did perceive
<PB N="109" REF="61">him, which made him chatter &s;o fa&s;t and &s;o loud, all the while tear|ing of the Letter, that <HI>Camille</HI> thought there was no time to lo&s;e, therefore he &s;uddenly ru&s;h'd upon the Monkey, who being too nim|ble for him, did run away, &s;queek|ing &s;o loud that the Marque&s;s being alarm'd at it, did pre&s;ently get to the Window, with a Pi&s;tol in his hand, and perceiving <HI>Camille</HI> who was very bu&s;ie in gathering up the pieces of Paper, that the Mon|key had &s;catter'd, he di&s;charg'd it at him, but to no effect.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> at the noi&s;e of the Pi&s;tol, did run as fa&s;t as he could towards the place where they had left the Ladder of Ropes hanging, by which they had got over, but meeting by chance with the Monkey, which he took for a Man, his fears magnifying all ob|jects, he ran counter, and know|ing no better way, finding him|&s;elf near a high Tree, he pre&s;ently
<PB N="110" REF="62">climbes to the top of it, where he hid him&s;elf among&s;t the thicke&s;t of the Leaved Branches.</P>
<P><HI>Camille</HI> having gathered all that he could find of the pieces of Pa|per, made what ha&s;te he could to|wards the place of retreat, and not &s;eeing Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> as he pa&s;s'd by, he concluded that he was gone, which made him to follow after. By this the Marque&s;s and his Ser|vants were got into the Garden, with Guns, Pi&s;tols, Swords, and other Weapons, they &s;earch every Bu&s;h, Hedge, and Corner, but find no body, the Marque&s;s &s;ees a piece of Paper lying upon the ground, he takes it up, and puts it into his Pocket to peru&s;e &s;ome other time; he was too bu&s;y then, nei|ther had he light enough to do it. Some run to the back Gate, which is found &s;hut, they perceive &s;ome Morter and Stones newly dropp'd from the Wall which made them conclude that they were Thievs
<PB N="111" REF="62">gone that way out, &s;o that they were all returning in.</P>
<P>As the Marque&s;s was pa&s;&s;ing un|der a Tree, he was hit on the Hat with a piece of withered Branch, at which he pre&s;ently looks up, and perceives &s;omething to move; here|joices within him&s;elf already, that he had found the Robbers of his Honour, and commands &s;ome of his Servants to get up, and fetch them down, dead or a live. While he was pon|dering what Torments and Racks he &s;hould make them endure, &s;ome of the Servants being got up, they heard a &s;trange chattering, for the Monky who had caus'd the dryed bow to fall, finding him&s;elf pur&s;u|ed &s;o clo&s;e, made &s;uch a noi&s;e as pre&s;ently gave to under&s;tand to his pur&s;uers the Nature of the Bea&s;t. But the Marque&s;s's di&s;tru&s;tful Nature, making him &s;u&s;pect that it might be &s;ome Counterfeit, he com|manded his Servants to pur&s;ue and take him. The unlucky nimble
<PB N="112" REF="63">Creature, having no other way to avoid his pur&s;uers, he leaps from the Tree he was on to the next, where &s;at the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> whom the fooli&s;h Crea|ture taking to be one of his Ene|mies, he began to &s;queek and chat|ter more than ever: Tho&s;e that were upon the abandon'd Tree ha|ving given notice of their Preys re|moval; the Marque&s;s &s;ent &s;ome up the other Tree, on which both the delinquents were retreated; one of the climbers went &s;o high after this little trouble&s;om Annimal, that he perceiv'd a certain pair of Legs, that did not belong unto &s;o &s;mall a Bea&s;t as a Monkey. The poor Father now perceiving that he was di&s;co|vered, pa&s;t all hopes of Redempti|on, was recommending his ca&s;e to all the He and She Saints, be&s;ides the Eleven thou&s;and Virgins; when his fierce Enemy cry'd, <HI>Oh! have I found you out? I'll fetch you down pre&s;ently:</HI> This dreadful
<PB N="113" REF="63">threatning did &s;et him into &s;uch an horror and fear, that it caus'd him to drop down &s;omething, which his angui&s;h would not let him retain a|ny longer, ju&s;t in the nick of time as the fellow was gaping and look|ing up; which did light &s;o full upon his Face, that it &s;topt his Mouth from telling any more tales for that bout; and blinded him &s;o, that go|ing to clear his Eyes with his Hands, he was &s;o unfortunate as to let go his hold, which made him fall to the ground, whence he was carried away &s;peechle&s;s. This &s;ad accident put an end to the Chace; for the Marque&s;s thinking that there was too much mi&s;chief done already, in the pur&s;uit of a Monkey, did give order to all his Servants to retreat, and let the Bea&s;t a|lone, which they pre&s;ently obey'd, taking the dead along with them.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Andrew</HI> having overheard the &s;ad accident, that had been
<PB N="114" REF="64">the cau&s;e of his &s;ad and &s;afe delive|rance; after he had return'd thanks to all his Advocates, (though he thought his own indu&s;try very in|&s;trumental in it, which made him ever after, to rely very much on his own merits) finding the Coa&s;t clear, he comes down the Tree, and goes toward the place, by which he had come in, whereon he was looking very melancholick, having no hopes of getting out of the Garden, when he perceives a head peeping over the Garden-Wall: at the fir&s;t his fears were go|ing to make him run to his old po&s;t again; but pre&s;ently recollecting him&s;elf, he thought that it could not be any one of the Hou&s;e; be|cau&s;e that whoever did look over the Wall, mu&s;t be in the Street: A little after he perceiv'd that it was <HI>Camille;</HI> who having not found him at home, was return'd with the Ladder of Ropes to get him off, if he was not taken. The poor Fa|ther
<PB N="115" REF="64">did pre&s;ently get over, and without &s;peaking one word, he run as fa&s;t as he could to his Lodg|ings, where he gave <HI>Camille</HI> a full account of the whole adventure, while he was fitting every bit of Paper to it's right place, which having done he read it as follows.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="65">was &s;omething wanting of the Letter; which he having left behind, had doubtle&s;s fallen into the Marque&s;s his hands; that joy, which had been &s;crew'd up almo&s;t to an exce&s;s, by every Character of the Letter, was in|&s;tantly da&s;h'd to pieces, at the want of that &s;mall piece of Paper, which he fancied did contain great mat|ters, and of &s;uch weight peradven|ture, as might enlighten the Mar|que&s;s to the great prejudice, if not total ruine of the whole de&s;ign: while he was thus left in the dark, he gave to that word a thou&s;and interpretations, all of very dange|rous con&s;equences. He call'd him|&s;elf a thou&s;and fools, for leaving a|ny pieces of Paper behind him; he as many times cur&s;t that mi&s;chie|vous Creature, that had been the cau&s;e of it, and as oft he call'd him|&s;elf unhappy and mi&s;erable; but all this would not bring the want|ing piece of Paper to the re&s;t; and
<PB N="118" REF="66">that which added much to his &s;or|row, was the coldne&s;s which he found in Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> as to any further attempts in his behalf; the very thoughts of the late dangers, in which he had &s;o lately been in|gag'd, did make him die with ve|ry fear; not knowing but that the piece of Paper that was wanting, might inform the Marque&s;s of the mi&s;tery of the Glove; &s;o that <HI>Ca|mille</HI> had much to do to buoy him up in that Sea of fears and perplexities, wherein the dejected Father was almo&s;t over-whelm'd; yet after that <HI>Camille</HI> had read the Letter, and a&s;&s;ur'd him, that there could be no &s;uch &s;ence attributed to that word, repre&s;enting to him, the caution with which the Marchio|ne&s;s did always accompany all her actions, and the utter ruin of all his hopes, if he &s;hould relent, and hearken; but when he under&s;tood what advantages and preferment, <HI>Camille</HI> did promi&s;e him, if the bu|&s;ine&s;s were once accompli&s;h'd, with
<PB N="119" REF="66">the Golden earne&s;t, which <HI>Camille</HI> did in&s;tantly give him in hand of it; he was quite vanqui&s;h'd, his hard-heartedne&s;s did vani&s;h with his fears, &s;o that he promis'd not to for&s;ake &s;o bountiful a Friend, in time of need; No, &s;aid, he it &s;hall ne|ver be &s;aid, that Father <HI>Andrew</HI> did once undertake an amorous in|triegue, and left it off before it was accompli&s;h'd, e&s;pecially acting for a Patron of power and willingne&s;s to protect me, from all troubles and inconveniences; with that, calling for a gla&s;s of Wine to chear up his Spirits, and &s;tay his &s;tomach, till brakefa&s;t was ready, he drank to <HI>Camille,</HI> a Health to the beautiful Marchione&s;s, and to their good &s;ucce&s;s; <HI>Camille</HI> was not backwards in giving him all the incourage|ments that he could imagin; a little after, brakefa&s;t was brought up, and they having eaten, drank, and di&s;cours'd merrily, they laid them&s;elves to re&s;t, tiil it was time to return with the Glove.</P>
<PB N="120" REF="67">
<P>Mean time the Marque&s;s was po&s;&s;e&s;t with a more violent rage than ever. The Fellow that was carried in dead, after the admini|&s;tring of &s;ome Cordials and bleed|ings, coming to him&s;elf again, had declared, that he had &s;een a Man on the very uppermo&s;t branches of that Tree, off of which he had fal|len, who ca&s;ting &s;ome thing in his Eyes, while he was looking up, had caus'd him to let go his hold, which was the occa&s;ion of his fall, ju&s;t when he was giving notice of his di&s;covery. The Marque&s;s had pre&s;ently &s;ent divers Servants to &s;earch every Tree in the Garden, while he him&s;elf vi&s;ited all the un|derwoods; all to no purpo&s;e, the Featherle&s;s Bird being flown long before; &s;o that being return'd to his Wifes Chamber, he had gi|ven a full vent unto his fury, with &s;uch threatnings, which tended to the giving her of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fig, that there were cau&s;es to fear &s;ome &s;uch
<PB N="121" REF="67">&s;ad effect, at &s;ome time or other This did &s;trike &s;uch a terror in the Marchione&s;s's mind, that &s;he had no occa&s;ion to counterfeit, for &s;he fell into a feaver, though not ve|ry violent. Then &s;he took a full re|&s;olution, in order to &s;ave her own life, to make u&s;e of the Pilgrim's of|fers; though &s;he had once been in the mind to refu&s;e them, fearing that he &s;hould expect, as a reward, that which &s;he could not, nor ought not to give.</P>
<P>This &s;udden illne&s;s of the Mar|chione&s;s, did make the Marque&s;s, &s;o &s;oon as the fury of his pa&s;&s;ion was over, to &s;end for a Phy&s;itian, by the &s;olicitation of <HI>Zora,</HI> which were joyn'd to her Ladies de&s;ires; yet with &s;o much di&s;cretion, that the Marque&s;s took no further no|tice of it. A Servant was going for a Doctor, when at the Street-Door he met with the old peddling Woman, who was come to bring back the Glove. Who de&s;ired to
<PB N="122" REF="68">have it delivered to the Marchio|ne&s;s; the Servant an&s;wered, that it could not be now, becau&s;e that &s;he was fallen very ill of a &s;udden of a Feaver, and that he was &s;ent to &s;eek for a Doctor; but that being a Stranger, he knew not where to go. Alas! a-well-a-day, &s;aid the old Woman, I am heartily &s;orry for it, and &s;he has been &s;o good a Cu&s;tomer to me, that I will bring you to the mo&s;t eminent Doctor in Town; but he is a great Humouri&s;t, and a Man of very few words; and you mu&s;t let me alone to per|&s;uade him to go. The Fellow, glad of the opportunity, goes with the brisk old Woman, who returns to <HI>Camille,</HI> and leaving the Fellow be|low, while &s;he goes up to per&s;uade the famous Doctor; &s;he runs up to <HI>Camille,</HI> and informs him of the bu&s;ine&s;s, then pre&s;ently going down to the Servant, &s;he told him, that he &s;hould return home and tell them, that a Doctor would be with
<PB N="123" REF="68">them immediately; and withall gave him the Glove to deliver to &s;ome of the Marchione&s;s's Women, with which the Fellow return'd home, very well contented.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Andrew</HI> having thus acted the &s;econd part of the old Woman, he returns up to <HI>Camille,</HI> very glad that he had quitted his hands of that dangerous Glove; he pre|&s;ently advi&s;es <HI>Camille</HI> to write his mind, that he might give it to the Marchione&s;s, while he felt her Pul&s;e, and that he would take care to go to &s;ome Jew-Broker, and hire what was nece&s;&s;ary to make a Do|ctor of <HI>Camille; Camille</HI> pre&s;ent|ly falls a-writing, and Father <HI>An|drew</HI> goes, and in a trice returns again, with all things fitting, <HI>Ca|mille</HI> having written the&s;e few lines.</P>
<P><HI>Part of your Letter was lo&s;t, I fear your Husband has found it; I am come to receive new orders, all delays for the future will be of dan|gerous

<P><HI>Beauty, Madam, is not purely Ornamental, it has its other lu&s;tres and advantages likewi&s;e, which &s;peak its cele&s;tial origine, and ren|ders it as admirable, as it is Divine; as its powerful influences, which do produce &s;uch wonderful effects do dai|ly verify. With what eagerne&s;s has it made the greate&s;t Conquerours, in all Ages, to pro&s;trate them&s;elves be|fore it, and to lay their Trophies at the Feet of her Altars, leaving all their other concerns unregarded, to give them&s;elves wholly up to the admiration of its excellency? With what precipitation have the greate&s;t Monarchs de&s;cended from their Thrones, to pay homage unto its Im|perial Greatne&s;s? No Rank, Quali|ty,
<PB N="125" REF="69">or Condition, e&s;capes its power, Madam. The Prie&s;ts have de&s;i&s;ted addre&s;&s;ing of their Vows and Prayers to their neglected Deities, to offer at her Shrine, their Incen&s;e and Adora|tion. And the Grave Philo&s;ophers have laid a&s;ide their numerous Vo|lumes, to give them&s;elves up wholly unto the contemplation of its Cau&s;es and Effects; while the whole Crea|tion &s;tands in an amazement at the Glory thereof. Heroes will readily change their Swords for Palmers Staves; Kings and Emperours will Convert their Scepters into Sheep|herds Hooks; Prie&s;ts will turn their Bloody Sacrifices, and Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Raptures, into fragrant Offerings, and melodious Layes: Sour Philo&s;o|phers, will neglect their more crab|bed part of Learning to Dream of</HI> Eli|zium <HI>Fields; all Conditions will for|get their Intere&s;ts, and transform them&s;elves into all manner of Forms, to render them&s;elves agreeable, and ob&s;equiou&s;ly &s;ub&s;ervient to its Com|mands.</HI></P>

<P><HI>It is true, Madam, that like un|to other Divinities, Beauty does make u&s;e of &s;econdary Cau&s;es, to work tho&s;e wonderful Effects. But it chiefly employs Love, that powerful Agent, wherewith it fills all Hearts with &s;uch a Divine Flame, as in&s;pires and incites tho&s;e who&s;e Bo&s;oms are warmed with it, to perform the greate&s;t actions: For, without it, Madam, whoever did attain to more than common things? But when once a Heart is quickned by that &s;ubtle Fire, what dangerous Enterpri&s;es, what difficult Attempts, and what intricate De&s;igns are there, which are not undertaken with as much celerity, and eagerne&s;s, as they are performed with vigour and good &s;ucce&s;s?</HI></P>
<P><HI>No wonder, Madam, if &s;ome Sparks of that Cele&s;tial Fire, having alighted upon my prepared Heart, they have fill'd it with a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;io|nate de&s;ire to become a votary unto the Altars of your excellent Beauty,
<PB N="127" REF="70">to the exclu&s;ion of all other Terre|&s;trial devotion. Deign therefore, Madam, to accept of the Offerings which I make unto you of it, and be pleas'd to reward, in due time, its fi|delity and per&s;everance, with &s;ome grains of reciprocal affection.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e lines which were both a Panegyrick to Beauty, and a decla|ration of Love, did rai&s;e &s;uch a ten|der vail of tincture over all the Lil|lies of the Marchione&s;s's Cheeks, as did almo&s;t termine into blu&s;hes, when &s;he read them; &s;he gue&s;t at what the Pilgrim did aim, which at all other times would have caus'd her to break all further corre&s;pon|dency with him, but as things &s;tood then, not knowing how to mend her &s;elf for the pre&s;ent, &s;he was glad of any opportunity, and to employ all &s;orts of In&s;truments; leaving to her &s;elf the management of the con&s;equences hereafter.</P>

<P><HI>Camille</HI> was in&s;tantly fitted, while the good Father accoutres him&s;elf to per&s;onate the Mule-dri|ver. They were ju&s;t got ready, when news was brought up, that the Marque&s;s his Servant was come again for the Doctor: They go im|mediately, the Servant leads the Van, our new vamp'd Doctor is in the Main, and Father <HI>Andrew</HI> brings up the Rear; they come to the Marque&s;s his Door, the Do|ctor alights from his grave Bea&s;t, and is conducted up into the Lady's Chamber, which was made &s;o dark, becau&s;e that the light did offend her Eyes, and caus'd her Head to ake, that the Doctor was forc'd to be conducted to the Bed|&s;ide, by one of her Women; there he feels her Pul&s;e, gives her the Letter, and making as if he ask'd her &s;ome private que&s;tions, he &s;teals a ki&s;s from her Hand, and another from her Lips, after which he re|tires at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the
<PB N="129" REF="71">Bed &s;ide; after which the Marque&s;s, who had &s;tood all the while near the Window, came and acco&s;ted the Doctor, inquiring of him, how he found his Patient, and what hopes there was; to which he made no other an&s;wer, than that he would quickly go and pre&s;cribe for her; and that when &s;he had taken what he would &s;end, he would be better able to give him an account; with that the Marque&s;s gives him his Fee, and away goes our Do|ctor.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s returning into his Wives Chamber from conducting the Doctor, he is met by <HI>Zora,</HI> who tells him that the Marchione&s;s would &s;leep, which made him re|tire, and take along with him the o|ther Woman, that their chat might not di&s;turb her re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Zora</HI> being left &s;ingle with her Lady in her Chamber, &s;he asks how &s;he does, and the Marchione&s;s find|ing her &s;elf &s;omething better than
<PB N="130" REF="72">&s;he had been, told her &s;o, after which <HI>Zora</HI> falls down on her knees by the Bed &s;ide, and with tears in her Eyes, &s;he began to &s;peak thus un|to her Lady.</P>
<P>Madam, you may &s;u&s;pect, and with much Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, that what&s;oever I &s;hall &s;ay to you, may be to your prejudice, and with a de&s;ign to intrap you, and make you more mi&s;erable yet, than you are; and of truth I mu&s;t needs con|fe&s;s, that when I con&s;ider with what exactne&s;s I have ob&s;erv'd and executed your Husbands orders, even with that &s;everity, which was beyond his expectation, in which I have &s;hewn my &s;elf mo&s;t inhu|mane towards one of my own Sex, though far above me in merits, and all &s;orts of re&s;pects; I then de&s;pair of ever prevailing with you, to add faith to what I &s;hall &s;ay. There|fore, Madam, I mu&s;t be forc'd to make u&s;e of &s;omething more than my bare words and relation, to con|vince
<PB N="131" REF="72">you of the &s;incerity of my pre|&s;ent intentions: Yet thus much I have to &s;ay for my &s;elf; that all the cruel &s;everity that I have ever ex|ercis'd again&s;t you, has never pro|ceeded from any particular aver&s;i|on, hatred, or prejudice, that I could have again&s;t your per&s;on, but from meer intere&s;t and greedi|ne&s;s of profit, which made me think, that the more &s;evere I &s;hould expre&s;s my &s;elf again&s;t you, the better I &s;hould be rewarded by him that had employ'd me; I was a poor mi&s;erable Creature ready to peri&s;h for want, when the Marque&s;s took me into his &s;ervice, to be one of the in&s;truments of his cruelty towards you; and finding the com|forts of a full Table, warm cover|ing, and other refre&s;hments, be&s;ides the hopes of laying up &s;omething again&s;t my old age, which is com|ing on very fa&s;t, and then re|flecting with horrour, on my late
<PB N="132" REF="73">and mi&s;erable condition; the ap|prehen&s;ions and dread of returning unto that woful &s;tate again, and the obligations which I thought that I owed unto my Benefactor, were the true promoters of all the &s;or|rows, troubles, and afflictions which you have &s;ince &s;u&s;tained through my means. But, Madam, con|tiued &s;he, there is no heart, though never &s;o hard and cruel, but at &s;ome time or other will relent, and give way unto &s;ome &s;parks of compa&s;&s;i|on: &s;ince our arrival at <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> I have had now and then &s;ome re|mor&s;e and pitty of your condition, which has &s;ometime made me wi&s;h, that it were my Fortune to get a livelihood by any other means, than &s;uch as did appear to me to be again&s;t all the Rules of Humani|ty and Religion. This has made me to reflect upon the &s;everity, with which you have met on all hands, (excepting Heaven, who has plen|tifully recompenc'd you in all the
<PB N="133" REF="73">accompli&s;hments of the body and mind.) Fir&s;t from your Parents, as I have been inform'd, who contra|ry to your inclinations, did force you to marry a Per&s;on, whom you had declared you hated, and for whom you could never have any Love; but on the contrary, that you look'd upon him as the greate&s;t of your Enemies. Then, Madam, when I added to this, that cruel Ty|ranny, that your jealous Husbands humour has caus'd him to exerci&s;e over you, without the lea&s;t occa&s;i|on imaginable, &s;ince the very fir&s;t moment that he could call you his, and the examplary patience, with which you have endured all his unkindne&s;&s;es: The&s;e things have made me divers times wi&s;h that you were freed from that &s;lavery in which you langui&s;h. But when lately, as I was looking out of the Window, I did &s;ee that Pilgrim, who for your &s;ake has &s;uffer'd &s;o much already, to be dragg'd and
<PB N="134" REF="74">hal'd to Pri&s;on, with as little compa&s;&s;ion, as if it had been a Dog, it came within my thoughts, that if this poor Gentleman did &s;uf|fer &s;o much for your &s;ake, only for endeavouring to free you from that mi&s;ery you groan under; what did I de&s;erve, that was one of the un|worthy in&s;truments of your af|flictions. Yet, Madam, this is not all; that which has concluded this through Reformation in me, are tho&s;e Words that your Hus|band does frequently let fall in his pa&s;&s;ions of late; which &s;peak as if he would attempt &s;omething a|gain&s;t your Life: Tho&s;e indeed reach'd to my very Heart. The&s;e things, Madam, have made me enter into &s;ome &s;erious con&s;iderati|ons within my &s;elf, from them I am come to reflections, and tho&s;e have brought me to a firm re&s;oluti|on, rather to peri&s;h, than to live through &s;o unworthy means as I do at pre&s;ent; and to prefer your
<PB N="135" REF="74">liberty and content, unto that pro&s;pect which I had of making my Fortune, by continuing to be your Keeper: Not without hopes, Ma|dam, that if you &s;hould get out of your Bondage, through my affi|&s;tance, you would con&s;ider my Services, and make up my lo&s;&s;es an|other way. And now, Madam, to confirm what I have &s;aid, and convince you, that it proceeds from a due &s;en&s;e of your mi&s;eries, which has produced a perfect and &s;incere repentance in me; be pleas'd to look on this Paper: With that &s;he gave the Marchione&s;s that Paper, which the Marque&s;s had taken up in the Garden; telling her that the Marque&s;s, pulling out his Handker|chief, had dropp'd it; and that &s;he having taken it up, look'd on it, and found it did &s;o much concern her, &s;he kept it to give it her, not|with&s;tanding the great inquiries and &s;earch which the Marque&s;s had made after it, &s;he having flat|ly
<PB N="136" REF="75">deny'd to him, that &s;he had &s;een any. The Marchione&s;s having ta|ken it, read as follows.</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;The Doctor, as you have formerly the Pilgrim, give me an account of your re&s;olutions, by the counterfeit old Woman, when &s;he brings me the Glove, who was &s;o ex|cellently di&s;guis'd, that I did not know the good Father</HI> Andrew, <HI>till he had given me &s;ome &s;igns of it.</HI></P>
<P>That was enough to let the Mar|chione&s;s know, that this was the latter part of her Letter to the Pil|grim, which &s;he had dropp'd out of her Window. This did fully confirm her, that <HI>Zora</HI> was a true Convert, which did give her very great &s;atisfaction, but when &s;he thought that her Husband had &s;een it, by which he would di&s;cover the whole Plot, &s;he vi&s;ibly chang'd colour, and was yielding to her &s;orrow, when <HI>Zora</HI> told her that &s;he &s;hould be chearful, and hope the be&s;t; for by the Marque&s;s his &s;ilence, and not inquiring after
<PB N="137" REF="75">the old Woman, mention'd in that Paper; it is, Madam, continued &s;he, an argument that he has not read it, he would be &s;o impatient otherwi&s;e to be reveng'd of Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> whom he mortally hates, that he could not have forborn inquiring after the old Woman an hundred times over; and be&s;ides, Madam, pre&s;ently after he had let fall the Paper, he &s;eem'd much troubled, and was looking up and down for it; which makes me conclude, that he has not read it. The con|fu&s;ion that he was in at fir&s;t, by the fall of the man from the Tree, having certainly put it out of his Head, and when he had lo&s;t it then he thought of it again. But what confirms me mo&s;t of all, is, that when the Glove was given to my fellow Servant, &s;he was met by the Marque&s;s, who only look|ing on it, did return it her again, without &s;peaking one word more, than asking whether the Woman was paid for it.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="76">
<P>That indeed is &s;ignificant, then &s;aid the Marchione&s;s: and now <HI>Zo|ra,</HI> I find that I may breathe again; I believe your Conver&s;ion to be &s;in|cere and real; and I do a&s;&s;ure you, that you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to re|pent it; but on the contrary, the &s;ooner you &s;erve me in my de&s;igns, of freeing my &s;elf from that &s;lavery in which I live, under continual apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing my life, and perpetual reproaches and af|fronts without cau&s;e, the &s;ooner you will feel the effects of my boun|ty, which I do a&s;&s;ure you &s;hall ex|tend to the making you happy the re&s;idue of your days. I wanted but a Woman to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my re&s;olu|tions; and now I have thee, I &s;hall willingly embrace the &s;uccour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the Pilgrim does offer me. I did fear, before, to fall alone, into the hands of a young man, who was an ab&s;olute Stranger to me and might peradventure take all the advantages that could
<PB N="139" REF="76">be again&s;t me, and expect &s;uch re|wards as virtue would forbid me to give: but now I will fir&s;t make my own terms, and oblige him to put me into tho&s;e hands that I &s;hall think fit; for my de&s;ign be|ing not to wholly abandon my Hus|band, but to retire from his pa&s;&s;i|ons, till by &s;ome Friends, a better under&s;tanding is wrought between us, and &s;o return to him again; if my deliverer &s;hould require more of me than my honour would per|mit me to allow of, I &s;hould let him know his mi&s;take; and this I have &s;ome rea&s;ons to fear from his carri|age in his late vi&s;it, under the ha|bit of a Phy&s;itian. Here <HI>Zora</HI> did reiterate her Prote&s;tations, a&s;&s;uring the Marchione&s;s that &s;he needed but to command, and &s;he &s;hould find how readily &s;he would obey, even with the hazzard of her Life. I am &s;atisfied, continued the Mar|chione&s;s, and to confirm it to you, prepare your &s;elf to follow the Do|ctor,
<PB N="140" REF="77">&s;o &s;oon as he &s;hall return, for I will &s;end you after him with a Letter, in which I will fully de|clare my mind to him, and make my own conditions, before I put my &s;elf into his hands, and you &s;hall bring me back a full and po&s;i|tive an&s;wer. <HI>Zora</HI> told the Mar|chione&s;s, that &s;he would pre&s;ently ask the Marque&s;s leave to go forth, to &s;ee a Kin&s;woman of hers, that liv'd in Town, and that under that pretence &s;he would wait on the Doctor. This being con|cluded on, the Marchione&s;s bid her go call in her fellow Servant to &s;tay by her, while &s;he &s;hould go get her Pen, Ink, and Paper, and convey it into her Clo&s;et, where &s;he would go and write the Letter to the Pil|grim, under pretence of going to her devotions; <HI>Zora</HI> being gone, and the other Woman come in her place, the Marchione&s;s laid her &s;elf upon her Bed again not &s;o much to &s;leep, as to reflect on <HI>Camille</HI>'s bold|ne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="77">
<P>She fear'd that that Per&s;on who had had the confidence to ki&s;s her, &s;o &s;oon as he came near her, while her Husband and her Guardians were in the Chamber, would at|tempt more if he &s;hould once have her in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and without company, and her apprehen&s;ions did &s;o increa&s;e, the more &s;he did think on it, that without that a&s;&s;i|&s;tance which &s;he did expect from the Convert <HI>Zora,</HI> &s;he had not &s;o much as writ to the Pilgrim fur|ther, than ju&s;t to let him know that her mind was alter'd, and there|fore had no further occa&s;ion of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but &s;he thought that through <HI>Zora's</HI> aid &s;he might &s;o or|der things, as to continue Mi&s;tre&s;s of her &s;elf, though got from her Husband by the Pilgrims help, e&s;pe|cially making her conditions with him before-hand; therefore &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Zora</HI> was return'd, and had made her &s;igns, that the writing tools were in a readine&s;s; the

<P>The Marchione&s;s lying on the Bed had call'd her Woman to her, and had told her in a manner, as if newly awakned by <HI>Zora</HI>'s coming into the Chamber, and as being af|frighted, that &s;he was very much out of order, and di&s;turb'd with a &s;trange Dream which &s;he had had, or rather a Vi&s;ion, &s;aid &s;he, for I have &s;o per|fect an Idea &s;till remaining of what I have lately &s;een in my Dream, that I cannot well recollect my &s;elf, to know whether I was &s;leeping or waking.

The Marque&s;s was come to the Door, when the Marchio|ne&s;s was about this part of her Story, and &s;he &s;poke &s;o low, that he could hear but here and there a word, of
<PB N="183" REF="98">which he could make nothing; &s;he was going on in this manner, This Mon&s;ter would often make toward me, as if to devour me, and would &s;hew his Teeth, but did not bite; but his Tongue was more to be fear'd, than his Teeth, and always as he made at me, he would be hindred by &s;ome of tho&s;e that &s;tood by me; and when he would make towards any body el&s;e, I would give them notice of it: Then I thought that he would make at me again, with more fury than before, &s;o that he was &s;ometimes ready to &s;wallow me up; at which the Religious man would pray and u&s;e &s;uch Exorci&s;ms as the Church has ordain'd again&s;t evil Spirits, while that the di&s;|guis'd Per&s;on would &s;trike at him, with a Sword which he had con|ceal'd under his Cloaths, not to hurt him, but to affright him with the &s;plendour of it; but then the Woman would &s;tay his Arm, and when at any time this di&s;guis'd Per|&s;on

<P><HI>Zora</HI> was not long before &s;he got to <HI>Camille's,</HI> whom &s;he inform'd of what &s;he had done, and that the Marchione&s;s had a knowledge of it: She likewi&s;e gave him an account of his fair e&s;cape, which he had made out of the Marque&s;s's Hou&s;e, while that the Marque&s;s had &s;ent her on purpo&s;e to bring him to his inevitable Death.

<PB N="224" REF="119">Litter, in which there were two Suits of Cloaths, to dre&s;s him&s;elf and <HI>Camille</HI> in, like Mule drivers.

<P>While the&s;e things had been tran&s;acting abroad, the Marque&s;s had been examining the Pilgrim, which the Jaylor had brought to him according to his Orders; at the
<PB N="225" REF="119">very fir&s;t &s;ight of him, he found him not to be that Pilgrim which he meant, and at la&s;t having found his mi&s;take, and the cau&s;e of it, through his examining of every cir|cum&s;tance, he di&s;charg'd the fellow giving him a piece of Money for to make him amends for the wrong which he had done him, with which he went his way very well &s;atisfy'd, that he had got his liber|ty at la&s;t, with a good &s;um of Mo|ney.</P>
<P>Mean time <HI>Zora</HI> was return'd home, where &s;he had had &s;ome op|portunity, during the Marque&s;s's examination of the Pilgrim, to give the Marchione&s;s the Note, and a full account of all their proceed|ings, the Marchione&s;s was very well pleas'd with what <HI>Zora</HI> did tell her, whereby divers &s;cruples which had ri&s;en in her mind, were re|mov'd: pre&s;ently after the Mar|que&s;s came into the Chamber, and <HI>Zora</HI> told him, that there would be
<PB N="226" REF="120">a Litter at the time and place ap|pointed, with which he &s;eem'd ve|ry well &s;atisfy'd: The re&s;t of that day the Marque&s;s did &s;pend in giv|ing his la&s;t orders to his Servants, and to get tho&s;e things together which he intended for his pre&s;ent u&s;es.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patch'd all other bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, he return'd to his Wives Chamber, where he bid his Wife and <HI>Zora</HI> to prepare to be going with|in an hour, it being already towards the Evening. This made <HI>Zora</HI> to bu&s;&s;el about, and to fit the Marchi|one&s;s in a travelling po&s;ture; at la&s;t, the Coach which the Marque&s;s had appointed came to the Door, which made him to call upon his Wife once again; he led her to it, where he plac'd her, after which, he and <HI>Zora</HI> went in it; it was dark, and he had &s;o muffled up both his Wife and <HI>Zora</HI> in Cloaks, that no body could well di&s;cern, if they were men or Women; in a &s;hort
<PB N="227" REF="120">time after they came to the place, where the Litter was waiting for them, and his Mule likewi&s;e, which he had &s;ent before, who&s;e Feet had been &s;tuff'd, by the two new Mule|drivers, with things more unea&s;ie, than &s;he could well indure. So &s;oon as the Marque&s;s did &s;ee the Litter, and having ha&s;tily plac'd his Wife in it, and <HI>Zora</HI> by her, he made it vp him&s;elf, and bidding the Mule|drivers go on, he got upon his Mule and follow'd.</P>
<P>They had not gone far before the Marque&s;s's Mule began to halt, but he put her on &s;till, till at la&s;t &s;he could, or would not go any fur|ther; he did what he could to force her to it, but all in vain, for at la&s;t &s;he fairly laid her &s;elf down, which oblig'd the Marque&s;s to alight, and call after the Mule-drivers to &s;tay, but they impatient to be at that place where they were expected by <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> and his Lady, they went on the fa&s;ter, he run after them
<PB N="228" REF="121">crying as loud as he could for them to &s;tay, but the uncivil Mule-dri|vers, did not &s;o much as once look back; on the contrary the louder he call'd, and the fa&s;ter he did run, the fa&s;ter they drove, till they came to a turning, where they met with their Friends; pre&s;ently was the Marchione&s;s taken out of the Litter by <HI>Camille,</HI> and led to <HI>Al|phon&s;o</HI>'s Coach, where re&s;igning her into his Ladies Hands: <HI>Thus, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>do I part with you, according to your de&s;ires, and my pro|mi&s;e, into the Hands of this mo&s;t worthy Lady; and now, Madam, you are at your own di&s;po&s;al;</HI> there was no time for longer Compli|ments, the Marchione&s;s only &s;aid: <HI>Now I find that you are truly gene|rous, and that I have not deceiv'd my &s;elf: Camille</HI> gave her not time to &s;ay more, for he pre&s;ently put off his di&s;gui&s;e, and having got on a Hor&s;e, he and <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> did ride by the Coach &s;ide, while it carried
<PB N="229" REF="121">the two Ladies; <HI>Zora</HI> and Father <HI>Andrew,</HI> another way into the Ci|ty again, where they all got into <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI>'s Hou&s;e by the back Door.</P>
<P>Mean time the poor Marque&s;s did continue his hollowing and cal|ling after the Mule-drivers, though he had long &s;ince lo&s;t the &s;ight of them, and did trudg as he could after them; but the Gallants were gone with their Booty long before he did overtake the empty Litter, which the Mules (being left at their own di&s;po&s;al) had carried to a little by-place, clo&s;e by the great Road, where they were biting upon a little Gra&s;s, which they had met with; &s;o that when he came up wearied and almo&s;t &s;pent, he pre&s;ently look'd into it, but finding no body there, nor any where thereabouts, he fairly enter'd it to re&s;t him&s;elf, never minding where the Mules did carry him; and they having eaten that little of Gra&s;s that they
<PB N="230" REF="122">had met with, they went on, as by chance they had turn'd them&s;elves which prov'd to be the ready way back to the City.</P>
<P>The poor Marque&s;s being thus carried, he knew not whether, nor did he care to know, with a very &s;low pace: He had both time and conveniency, to reflect on all his mi&s;|fortunes, and e&s;pecially on the greate&s;t of all, the lo&s;s of his Wife; concluding with him&s;elf, that the whole world did con&s;ent to his mi|&s;eries. What to do, which way to go, or what to re&s;olve upon, he knew not; therefore letting the Mules go which way they pleas'd, he began to con&s;ider with him&s;elf, what was the rea&s;on that he was &s;o unfortunate above all other men: among&s;t many things which came to his Fancy on this account, the great &s;everity with which he had us'd his Wife, by giving too much &s;cope unto his pa&s;&s;ions, did not a little perplex him, which might be
