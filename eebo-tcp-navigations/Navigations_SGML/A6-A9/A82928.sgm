<HEAD>A NARRATIVE Of the Action at SANCTA CRUZ.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter taking in the Supply of Vi|ctuals that was brought us the lat|ter end of <HI>March,</HI> we &s;pent two or three days before the Town of <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> and finding the Enemy there in no great forwardne&s;s to come forth with a Fleet as was expected, The General on the Thirteenth of <HI>April,</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty &s;even, called the Commanders toge|ther, and communicated his thoughts to go for <HI>Sancta Cruz,</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> laying be|fore them the rea&s;ons that induced him to it, which they all approved of, and a favorable Gale ju&s;t at the time pre&s;ented to carry us thither. On the Eigh|teenth following in the evening we di&s;covered Land, &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Point Negro,</HI> but being thick-and hazy, could not certainly make it till Noon the next day, whereby the Enemy had longer notice of our being on the Coa&s;t then we de&s;igned he &s;hould, before we came to Action.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> the twentieth of <HI>April</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty &s;even, we were by break of day fair in the <HI>Offin</HI> of <HI>Sancta Cruz,</HI> and, as &s;oon as 'twas light, perceived by a Signal from one of our Friggots a head, that the <HI>West-India</HI> Fleet were in the Bay. Whereup|on, after a &s;hort Conference how to order the Attempt, and earne&s;t &s;eeking to the Lord for his pre&s;ence, we fell in among&s;t them, and by eight of the clock were all at an Anchor, &s;ome under the Ca&s;tle and Forts, and others by the Ships &s;ides, as we could birth our &s;elves to keep clear one of another, and be&s;t annoy the Enemy.</P>
<P>They had there five or &s;ix Galleons (whereof were Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral, with their Standart and Flags aloft) and other con&s;iderable Ships making up the number of &s;ixteen, &s;ome having Goods brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;till on board them, others had taken in Goods and Provi&s;ions to carry back again: Mo&s;t of them were furni&s;hed with Bra&s;s Ord|nance, and (as we have been informed &s;ince) had their full companies of Seamen and Souldiers kept continu|ally on board them, from their fir&s;t coming thither, which was about the beginning of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, their General him&s;elf in all the time lying but one night out of his Ship: they were moared clo&s;e along the Shore, which lies in the manner of a Semicircle, commanded, as far as the Ships rid, by the Ca&s;tle, and &s;urrounded be&s;ides with &s;ix or &s;even Forts, with almo&s;t a continued Line for Mu&s;queteers and great Shot, as the Ground be|tween admitted; And we were forced to come &s;o near to do our work, that many of the Men we have &s;lain and wounded, were &s;hot by the Mu&s;queteers from the Shore; Notwith&s;tanding it plea&s;ed God that in four hours time their Men were beaten out, and all the Ships put a&s;hore, except the Admiral, and Vice-Admiral, who made the mo&s;t con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance. About two
<PB N="4" REF="4">of the clock the Vice-Admiral was &s;et on fire, and the Admiral, by &s;ome happy Shot, or other accident, &s;ud|denly blown up; having (as we perceived ju&s;t before) many Men on board her; by the evening all the re&s;t were fired, onely two that &s;unk down to rights, and had little but their Ma&s;ts appearing above water.</P>
<P>It remained to compleat this Mercy, that our own Ships &s;hould come off well, wherein the greate&s;t haz|zard and difficulty lay; for &s;ome riding near into the Shore, and being &s;orely maimed did require to be warped off, others when we came to weigh, drove with the winde all the while blowing right into the Bay, and one of our be&s;t Frigots &s;trook: The Enemy in the mean time &s;upplied fre&s;h men into his Forts for tho&s;e we had killed and beaten out in the heat of the Action, and from them and the Ca&s;tle continued plying upon us, till about &s;even of the clock at night, every Ship and Ve&s;&s;el belonging to our Fleet, were by the good hand of God got &s;afe out of command.</P>
<P>In this &s;ervice we had not above fifty &s;lain outright, and one hundred and twenty wounded, and the damage to our Ships was &s;uch as in two days time we indiffe|rently vvell repaired for pre&s;ent &s;ecurity: Which vve had no &s;ooner done, but the Winde veered to the South-We&s;t (which is rare among tho&s;e I&s;lands) and la&s;ted ju&s;t to bring us to our former Station neer <HI>Cape Maries,</HI> where we arrived the &s;econd of <HI>May</HI> follovving: For vvhich mercifull appearance all along vvith us, vve de|&s;ire the Lord may have the prai&s;e and glory, to vvhom onely it is due; and that all that hear of it may turn and &s;ay (as of a truth we have found) that <HI>among the gods there is none like unto him, neither are there any works like unto his works.</HI></P>
