<HEAD>A great and wonderful Victory obtain|ed by the Engli&s;h hor&s;e and foot, un|der the command of Gen. Venables, in the We&s;t Indies: With the manner how they landed in the French Con|tinents, the oppo&s;ition made by the Natives, and others, with their Ar|rows, and the taking of mo&s;t of their Gold and Silver Mines.</HEAD>
<P>_BY an Expre&s;s brought from the Barba|does to VVhite-Hall, by a Merchant|man, we under&s;tand, That Gen. Pen and Gen Venables, having been there with the Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of 35 gallant &s;hips, after few dayes, being &s;upplyed with 2000 foot, and 700 hor&s;e, with all other Nece&s;&s;aries and Furniture of
<PB N="4" REF="3">war, a general Councel were called aboard the George, where the Officers unanimou&s;ly re&s;olv|ed to weigh Anchor, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign in hand, ac|cording to the Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions of his Highne&s;s the Lord Protector. In pur&s;uance whereof, Major Gen. Haines with his Squadron, was the fir&s;t that hoy&s;ted &s;ayl, and lanched forth among&s;t the cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Waves; and then immediat|ly Valiant Pen, with Gen. Venables, and the re&s;t of the Fleet bare up after them; bending their cour&s;e towards the Cariby I &s;lands; where, at the coming up of the Flag-&s;hips, the whole Navy had a Rendevouz: And from thence (if Report &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aks truth) to another part of the We&s;tern In|dies, where the French were as rich as potent, and by their extream predominancy, lamentably over awed the Engli&s;h; keeping them onely as meer va&s;&s;als and &s;laves, to &s;erve their in&s;atiable wils: but upon the neer approach of Englands &s;tately Ar|mado, great was the Allarm throughout tho&s;e I|&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds, and many were &s;truck with &s;uch a pannick fear, e&s;pecially the Natives, that they le&s;t many rich Commodities and goods behind them, en|deavouring to fly further up into the Countries;
<PB N="5" REF="3">but the Mon&s;ieurs remanded them back again by &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, cau&s;ing them to imbody with &s;undry darts, and &s;aying, they would make them da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken the Sky with Arrows: And &s;o drawing them up in a warlike po&s;ture, planted them and the Engli&s;h, (under Command of their own Officers) at the mo&s;t eminent and dangerous Pa&s;&s;es. This being done, the French Governour brought up his Re|&s;erves, and re&s;olved to make opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ition, but the two Generals di&s;charging &s;ome great Guns, and afterwards manning out their men &s;o &s;a&s;t in long boats, that they &s;oon forced their pa&s;&s;age upon Land, in which heroick A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chievment, the Volun|teers (formerly Commanders and Gentlemen of Fortune in the late K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs Army) performed &s;in|gular &s;ervice, &s;hewing abundance of gallantry, and magnanimity of &s;pirit in the very thicke&s;t of acti|on. And, indeed, though they are &s;aid to be but four hundred, yet thus much (to the honour of Engli&s;h-men) may be &s;aid, that their Gallantry (in &s;ome re&s;pect) extended as farre, as the Noble Acts of Chivalry of tho&s;e four thou&s;and &s;ouldi|ers at Numantia in Spain, who with&s;tood forty thou&s;and Romanes for fourteen years together, in which time having often valiantly repul&s;ed them,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and forced them unto two di&s;honorable compo&s;i|tions; at la&s;t when they could well hold out no longer, they gathered all their Armour, Money, and Goods together, and laid them on a heap; which being fired, they voluntarily buried them|&s;elves in the flames thereof, leaving unto Scipio nothing but the bare name of Numantia to adorn his tryumph with. In like manner, the fame of this &s;tory (by way of circum&s;tance) &s;aith, That &s;ome of the Mon&s;ieus, having exceedingly in|riched them&s;elves cho&s;e rather to fire their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and &s;acrifice their lives in the flames thereof, then yield and &s;ubmit to a &s;tranger; but the ma|jor part conceiving it no way po&s;&s;ible to with|&s;tand &s;o re&s;olved an enemy, ca&s;t down their arms and cryed for mercy. During which di&s;pute, ma|ny were killed and wounded (by e&s;timation 300, but the number not certainly known) and two or three thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners; (of all &s;orts and &s;exes) be&s;ides, it is &s;aid, that the Engli&s;h are be|come Ma&s;ters of no le&s;s then three and thirty gold and &s;ilver Mines; which, if true, will doubtle&s;&s;e make our Engli&s;h Continent the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Common-wealth under the Sun, and eternize their never-dying-&s;ame throughout all Ages.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P>And further it is &s;aid, that they have made &s;o great an inroad into the Countrey, for the &s;pace of twenty or thirty miles, that not an enemy dare not &s;o much as peep or &s;hew his head in any ho|&s;tile manner. And by the tender re&s;pect, affability and clemency of the Engli&s;h towards the poor Natives, &s;o great Effects have taken influence thereupon, that they are even &s;en&s;ible of their pre|&s;ent condition of Freedom, and &s;o tractable, that upon the lea&s;t motion or &s;ign, they become &s;er|viceable in any thing. But of this, and other par|ticulars, a Confirmation is &s;uddenly expected, in ca&s;e any thing hath occur'd of Action, which no way yet &s;eems unprobable, though in this jun|cture of time pre&s;ented &s;omewhat dubious; by rea&s;on I had rather pre-&s;uppo&s;e the event of mo|tionary action, then incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of any by way of dete&s;tation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>His Highne&s;s the Lord Protector, with the ad|vice of the Council, having taken into their gra|cious and &s;erious con&s;ideration, the pre&s;ent e&s;tate and condition of the Sea and Land-forces, under toe command of Gen. Pen, and Gen. Venables, have Ordered and Appointed, that a con&s;iderable num|ber of &s;hips be forthwith expedited for the &s;aid &s;er|vice, with &s;uch provisions and Nece&s;&s;aries as &s;hall be conceived requisite: And accordingly Nine &s;hips are now ready to be &s;et forth, viz. The Hen|ry, the Maiden-head, and &s;even others, with Bi&s;|kets, Chee&s;e, Butter, Beer, Beef, Pork, Pea&s;e, and di|vers other Nece&s;&s;aries: A pro&s;perous Gale at|tend them.</P>
