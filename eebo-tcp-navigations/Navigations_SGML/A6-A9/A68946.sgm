<P>_RIght Honorable, hauing by chaunce reco|uered
of late into my handes (after I had
once lost the &s;ame) a copie of the Di&s;cour&s;e
of our late VVe&s;t Indian voyage, vvhich
vvas begun by Captaine Bigges, vvho en|ded
his life in the &s;aid voyage after our de|parture
from Cartagena, the &s;ame being
aftervvardes finished (as I thinke) by
his Lieutenant Mai&s;ter Croftes, or &s;ome other, I knovve not
vvell vvho. Novve finding therein a mo&s;t true report of the
&s;eruices and other matters vvhich happened in the &s;ayd voyage,
the &s;ight vvhereof is vvonderfully de&s;ired by manie hone&s;t and
vvell di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons. I haue pre&s;umed to recommend the pub|lishing
thereof, vnto your Lordships protection and fauour, for
the&s;e tvvo cau&s;es. The one, for that your Lordships Honoura|ble
di&s;po&s;ition is in the knovvledge of all men that knovv your
&s;elfe, mo&s;t thir&s;tingly affected to embrace in your ovvne per&s;on,
<PB REF="3">
the braue&s;t enterpri&s;es, if the time vvould once affoord anie
&s;uch fit occa&s;ion, as might be agreeable to her Maiesties re|&s;olution:
vvho vvi&s;ely (and long may she do it) gouerneth
all things to the greate&s;t aduantage of her &s;elfe and people.
The other, becau&s;e my &s;elfe hauing bene a member in the &s;ayd
actions, and vvas Lieutenant of Mai&s;ter Carleils ovvne
companie, vvhereby I can vvell a&s;&s;ure the truth of this re|port:
I thought it my bounden duetie, hauing profe&s;&s;ed my
&s;eruice to your Lordship before all men, to dedicate the &s;ame
rather vnto your Lordship then to anie other. And although
it be novve a yeare and a halfe &s;ithence the voyage ended,
vvhereby &s;ome man vvill &s;ay, that it is novve no nevve
matter: yet the pre&s;ent time con&s;idered, hovv doubtfull &s;ome
of our meaner &s;ort of people are of the Spanish preparations,
I thinke this Di&s;cour&s;e a very fit thing to be published, that
they may &s;ee vvhat great victories a fevve English men haue
made vpon great numbers of the Spaniardes, euen at home in
their ovvne countreyes. The beholding vvhereof vvill much
encourage tho&s;e, vvho by fame and bare vvordes are made to
doubt much more then there is cau&s;e vvhy they should. Vpon
vvhich point, as there may be much &s;ayd: &s;o my &s;elfe being no
Di&s;cour&s;er, do de&s;ire to be held excu&s;ed therein: and there|fore
doe onely commend the trueth of this report vnto your
Lordship: vvhich vvill be al&s;o auovved by diuers Captaines

<P>After our going hence, which was the fourteenth
of September, in the yeare of our Lord, one thow|&s;and
fiue hundred eighty and fiue: and taking our
cour&s;e towards Spaine, we had the winde for a few
daies &s;omewhat skant, and &s;ometimes calme. And
being ariued neere that part of the coa&s;t of Spaine,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
which is called the Mores, we happened to e&s;pie
diuer&s;e &s;ailes, which kept their cour&s;e clo&s;e by the
&s;hore, the weather being faire and calme. The Ge|nerall
cau&s;ed the Vizeadmirall to goe with the Pin|naces
well manned to &s;ee what they were, who vp|pon
&s;ight of the &s;aid pinnaces approching nere vn|to
them, abandonned for the mo&s;t parte all their
&s;hippes (being Frenchmen) laden all with &s;alt, and
bounde homewardes into France, among&s;t which
&s;hips (being all but of &s;mall burden) there was one
&s;o well liked, which al&s;o had no man in her, as being
brought vnto the Generall, he thought good to
make &s;tay of her for the &s;eruice, meaning to pay for
her, as was accordingly performed at our returne,
which barke was called the Drake. The re&s;t of the&s;e
&s;hips being eight or nine, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without
any thing at all taken from them. VVe being after|wards
put &s;omewhat further off from the &s;hore, by
the contrarietie of winde, we happened to meete
with &s;ome other French &s;hips, full laden with New|land
fi&s;h, being vpon their returne homeward from
the &s;aid New found land: whom the Generall after
&s;ome &s;peech had with them, and &s;eeing plainly that
they were Frenchmen, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without once &s;uf|fering
any man to go aboord of them.</P>
<P>The day following &s;tanding in with the &s;hore a|gaine,
we di&s;cried an other tall &s;hip of twelue &s;core
<PB N="5" REF="5">
tunnes or thereabouts, vpon whom Mai&s;ter Car|leill
the Lieutenant generall being in the Tiger, vn|dertooke
the cha&s;e, whom al&s;o anone after the Ad|mirall
followed, and the Tiger hauing cau&s;ed the
&s;aid &s;trange &s;hip to &s;trike her &s;ailes, kept her there
without &s;uffering any bodie to go aboord vntill the
Admirall was come vp: who foorthwith &s;ending for
the Mai&s;ter, and diuer&s;e others of their principall
men, and cau&s;ing them to be &s;euerally examined,
founde the &s;hip and goodes to be belonging to the
inhabitants of S. SEBASTIAN in Spaine, but the
marriners to be for the mo&s;t parte belonging to
S. Iohn de LVCE &amp; the pa&s;&s;age. In this &s;hip was great
&s;tore of drie Newland fi&s;h, commonly called with
vs Poore Iohn, wherof afterwards being thus found
a lawfull prize, there was di&s;tribution made into all
the &s;hips of the Fleete, the &s;ame being &s;o newe and
good, as it did very greatly be&s;tead vs in the whole
cour&s;e of our voyage. A day or two after the taking
of this &s;hip, we put in with the I&s;les of BAYON, for
lacke of fauourable wind, where we had no &s;ooner
anckered &s;ome part of the Fleete, but the Generall
commaunded all the Pinnaces with the &s;hip boates
to be manned, and euerie man to be furni&s;hed with
&s;uch armes as was needefull for that pre&s;ent &s;eruice,
which being done, the Generall put him &s;elfe into
his Galley, which was al&s;o well furni&s;hed, and row|ing
<PB N="6" REF="6">
towards the Citie of BAYON, with intent, &amp; the
fauour of the Almighty to &s;urpri&s;e it. Before we had
aduaunced one halfe league of our way, there came
a me&s;&s;enger being an Engli&s;h Marchant form the
Gouernour, to &s;ee what &s;traunge Fleete we were,
who came to our Generall, and conferred a while
with him, and after a &s;mall time &s;pent, our Generall
called for Captaine Samp&s;on, and willed him to go
to the Gouernour of the Citie, to re&s;olue him of
two pointes. The fir&s;t, to knowe if there were any
warres betweene Spaine and England. The &s;econd
why our Marchants with their goods were imbar|red
or arre&s;ted. Thus departed Captaine Samp&s;on
with the &s;aid me&s;&s;enger to the citie, where he found
the Gouernour and people much amazed of &s;uch a
&s;udden accident.</P>
<P>The Generall with the adui&s;e and coun&s;ell of
Mai&s;ter Carleill his Lieutenant generall, who was
in the galley with him, thought not good to make
any &s;tand, till &s;uch time as they were within &s;hot of
the Citie, where they might be readie vpon the re|turne
of Captaine Samp&s;on, to make a &s;udden at|tempt
if cau&s;e did require before it was darke.</P>
<P>Captaine Samp&s;on returned with his me&s;&s;age in
this &s;ort. Fir&s;t, touching peace or warres, the Go|uernour
&s;ayd he knew of no warres, and that it lay
not in him to make any, he being &s;o meane a &s;ub|iect
<PB N="7" REF="6">
as he was. And as for the &s;tay of the Marchants
with their goods, it was the kings plea&s;ure, but not
with intent to endommage any man. And that the
kings conter commandement was (which had bene
receaued in that place &s;ome &s;eauennight before)
that Engli&s;h Marchants with their goods &s;hould be
di&s;charged: for the more verifying whereof, he
&s;ent &s;uch Marchants as were in the towne of our
Nation, who traffiqued tho&s;e parts: which being at
large declared to our Generall by them, coun&s;ell
was taken what might be&s;t be done. And for that
the night approched, it was thought needefull to
land our force, which was done in the &s;hutting vp of
the day, &amp; hauing quartered our &s;elues to our mo&s;t
aduantage, with &s;ufficient gard vpon euery &s;traight,
we thought to re&s;t our &s;elues for that night there.
The Gouernour &s;ent vs &s;ome refre&s;hing, as bread,
wine, oyle, apples, grapes, marmalad and &s;uch like.
About midnight the weather beginnes to ouerca&s;t,
in&s;omuch that it was thought meeter to repaire a|boord,
then to make any longer abode on land, and
before we could recouer the Fleete, a great tempe&s;t
aro&s;e, which cau&s;ed many of our &s;hips to driue from
their ancher hold, and &s;ome were forced to &s;ea in
great perill, as the barke Talbot, the barke Hawkins
and the Speedewell, which Speedewell onely was
driuen into England, the others recouered vs a|gain,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the extremity of the &s;torme la&s;ted three daies,
which no &s;ooner beganne to a&s;&s;wage, but Mai&s;ter
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, was &s;ent with his
owne &s;hip and three others: as al&s;o with the galley
and with diuers Pinnaces, to &s;ee what he might do
aboue VIGO, where he toke many boats and &s;ome
Caruels, diuer&s;ly laden with things of &s;mall value,
but chiefly with hou&s;hold &s;tuffe, running into the
high countrey, and among&s;t the re&s;t, he found one
boate laden with the principall Church &s;tuffe of the
high Church of VIGO, where al&s;o was their great
Cro&s;&s;e of &s;iluer, of very faire embo&s;&s;ed worke, and
double gilt all ouer, hauing co&s;t them a great ma&s;&s;e
of money. They complained to haue lo&s;t in all kind
of goods aboue thirtie thow&s;and Duckets in this
place.</P>
<P>The next day the General with his whole Fleete
went vp fro~ the Iles of BAYON, to a very good har|bour
aboue VIGO, where Mai&s;ter Carleill &s;tayd his
comming, a&s;well for the more quiet riding of his
&s;hips, as al&s;o for the good commoditie of fre&s;h wa|tering,
which the place there did afoord full well. In
the meane time the Gouernour of GALLISIA had
reared &s;uch forces as he might, his numbers by e&s;ti|mate
were &s;ome two thow&s;and foot, and three hun|dred
hor&s;e, &amp; marched from BAYON to this part of
the countrey, which lay in &s;ight of our Fleete, where
<PB N="9" REF="7">
making &s;tand, he &s;ent to parle with our Generall,
which was graunted by our Generall, &s;o it might be
in boates vpon the water: and for &s;afetie of their
per&s;ons, there were pledges deliuered on both
&s;ides, which done, the Gouernor of GALLISIA put
him &s;elfe with two others into our Vize-Admirals
Skiffe, the &s;ame hauing bene &s;ent to the &s;hore for
him: And in like &s;ort our General in his own Skiffe,
where by them it was agreed, we &s;hould furni&s;h our
&s;elues with fre&s;h water, to be taken by our own peo|ple
quietly on the land, and haue all other &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
paying for the &s;ame, as the place would
affoorde.</P>
<P>VVhen all our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was ended, we departed,
&amp; toke our way by the I&s;lands of CANARIA, which
are e&s;teemed &s;ome three hundred leagues from
this part of Sapin, &amp; falling purpo&s;ely with PALMA,
with intention to haue taken our plea&s;ure of that
place, for the full dige&s;ting of many things into or|der,
and the better funi&s;hing our &s;tore with &s;uch &s;e|uerall
good things as that affoordeth very abun|dantly,
we were forced by the vile &s;ea gate, which
at that pre&s;ent fell out, and by the naughtine&s;&s;e of
the landing place, being but one, and that vnder the
fauor of many Platformes, well furni&s;hed with great
ordinance, to depart with the receipt of many their
Canon &s;hot, &s;ome into our &s;hips, and &s;ome be&s;ides,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
&s;ome of them being in very deede full Canon high.
But the onely or chiefe mi&s;chiefe, was the daunge|rous
&s;ea &s;urge, which at &s;hore all alonge&s;t, plainly
threatned the ouerthrow of as many Pinnaces and
boates, as for that time &s;hould haue attempted any
landing at all.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing the expectation of this attempt fru|&s;trated
by the cau&s;es afore&s;aid, we thought it mee|ter
to fal with the I&s;le FERRO, to &s;ee if we could find
any better fortune, and comming to the I&s;land, we
landed a thou&s;and men in a valley vnder a high
mountaine, where we &s;tayed &s;ome two or three
houres, in which time the inhabitants, accompanied
with a yong fellow borne in England, who dwelt
there with them, came vnto vs, &s;hewing their &s;tate
to be &s;o poore, that they were all readie to &s;tarue,
which was not vntrue: and therefore without any
thing gotten, we were all commaunded pre&s;ently
to imbarke, &s;o as that night we put off to &s;ea South
Southea&s;t along towards the coa&s;t of Barbarie.</P>
<P>Vpon Saterday in the morning, being the thir|teenth
of Nouember, we fell with Cape Blancke,
which is a low land &amp; &s;hallow water, where we cat|ched
&s;tore of fi&s;h, &amp; doubling the Cape, we put into
the Bay, where we found certain Fre~ch &s;hips of war,
whom we entertained with great curte&s;ie, and there
left them. The after noone the whole Fleete a&s;&s;em|bled,

on which day we de&s;cried the I&s;land of S. IAGO,
and in the euening we anckered the Fleet betwene
the towne called the PRAY or PRAY and S. IAGO,
where we put on &s;hore a thou&s;and men or more,
vnder the leading of Mai&s;ter Chri&s;topher Carleill
Lieutenant Generall, who directed the &s;eruice mo&s;t
like a wi&s;e commaunder. The place where we had
fir&s;t to march did affoord no good order, for the
ground was mountaines and full of dales, being a
maruellous &s;tonie &amp; trouble&s;ome pa&s;&s;age, but &s;uch
was his indu&s;trious di&s;po&s;ition, as he would neuer
leaue, vntil we had gotten vp to a faire plaine, where
we made &s;tand for the a&s;&s;embling of the Army. And
when we were all gathered together vpo~ the plaine,
&s;ome two litle miles from the towne, the Lieute|nant
generall thought good not to make attempt
till day light: becau&s;e there was not one that could
&s;erue for guide or giuing knowledge at all of the
place. And therefore after hauing well re&s;ted, euen
halfe an houre before day, he commanded the Ar|mie
to be deuided into three &s;peciall parts, &s;uch as
he appointed, whereas before we had marched by
&s;euerall companies, being thereunto forced by the
naughtine&s;&s;e of the way as is afore&s;ayd.</P>

Now by the time we were thus raunged into a

and might verie plainely be veiwed all ouer from
that place where the whole Army was now arriued
&amp; pre&s;ently after the&s;e Captaines was &s;ent the great
En&s;igne, which had nothing in it but the plaine En|gli&s;h
Cro&s;&s;e, to be placed towardes the &s;ea, that our
fleet might &s;ee Saint Georges Cro&s;&s;e flori&s;h in the
enemies fortre&s;&s;e. Order was giuen that all the or|dinance
througout the towne and vpon all the plat|formes,
which was aboue fifty peeces all ready char|ged,
&s;hould be &s;hot of in honor of the Queenes Ma|ie&s;ties
coronation day, being the &s;euententh of No|uember,
after the yearly cu&s;tome of England, which
was &s;o an&s;wered againe by the ordinance out of all
the &s;hips in the fleete which now was come neere,
as it was &s;traunge to heare &s;uch a thondering noi&s;e
la&s;t &s;o long to gether. In this meane while the Leiu|tenaunt
generall held &s;till the mo&s;t part of his force
on the hill top, till &s;uch time as the towne was
quartered out for the lodging of the whole armie,
which being done euerie Captaine toke his owne
<PB N="13" REF="11">
quarter, and in the euening was placed &s;uch &s;uffici|ent
gard vpon euerie part of the towne that we had
no cau&s;e to feare any pre&s;ent enemie.</P>
<P>Thus we continued in the citie the &s;pace of four|teene
daies, taking &s;uch &s;poiles as the place yelded,
which were for the mo&s;t part, wine, oile, meale, and
&s;ome other &s;uch like things for victuall, as vineger,
oliues &amp; &s;ome other tra&s;h, as marchandi&s;e for their
Indian trades. But there was not found any trea&s;ure
at all, or any thing el&s;e of worth be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The &s;cituation of Sainct IAGO is &s;omwhat &s;trange
in forme like to a triangle, hauing on the Ea&s;t and
VVe&s;t &s;ides two mountaines of Rocke and cliffie,
as it were hanging ouer it, vpon the top of which
two mountains was builded certaine fortifications
to pre&s;erue the towne from any harme that might
be offered. From thence on the South &s;ide of the
towne is the maine &s;ea, and on the North &s;ide, the
valley lying betweene the fore&s;ayd mountaines,
wherein the towne &s;tandeth: the &s;aide valley and
towne both do grow very narrow, in&s;omuch that
the &s;pace betweene the two cliffes of this ende of
the towne is e&s;timated not to be aboue tenne or
twelue &s;core ouer.</P>
<P>In the midde&s;t of the valley cometh downe a ri|ueret,
rill, or brooke of fre&s;h water, which hard by
the &s;ea &s;ide maketh a pond or poole, whereout our
<PB N="14" REF="12">
&s;hips were watered with very great ea&s;e and plea|&s;ure.
Somewhat aboue the towne on the North &s;ide
betweene the two mountaines, the valley wageth
&s;omewhat larger then at the townes end, which val|ley
is wholie conuerted into gardens and orchards
well repleni&s;hed with diuers &s;orts of fruicts, herbes
&amp; trees, as lymmons, oranges, &s;uger canes, cochars
or cochos nuts, plantens, potato roots, cocombers,
&s;mall and round onions, garlicke, and &s;ome other
things not now remembred, among&s;t which the co|chos
nuts and plantens are very plea&s;ant fruicts, the
&s;ayd cochos hauing a hard &s;hell and a greene huske
ouer it, as hath our walnut, but it farre exceedeth in
greatne&s;&s;e, for this cochos in this greene huske is
bigger then any mans two fi&s;tes, of the hard &s;hell
many drinking cups are made here in England, and
&s;et in &s;iluer as I haue often &s;eene.</P>
<P>Next within this hard &s;hell is a white rine re&s;em|bling
in &s;hew very much euen as any thing may do,
to the white of an egge when it is hard boyled. And
within this white of the nut lyeth a water, which is
whiti&s;h and very cleere, to the quantitie of halfe a
pint or thereabouts, which water and white rine be|fore
&s;poken of, are both of a very coole fre&s;h ta&s;te,
and as plea&s;ing as any thing may be. I haue heard
&s;ome hold opinion, that it is very re&s;toratiue.</P>
<P>The Planten groweth in cods, &s;omewhat like to
<PB N="15" REF="12">
beanes, but is bigger and longer, and much more
thicke together on the &s;talke, and when it waxeth
ripe, the meate which filleth the rine of the cod be|commeth
yellow, and is exceeding &s;weet and plea|&s;ant.</P>
<P>In this time of our being there, hapned to come
a Portingall to the VVe&s;termo&s;t fort, with a flag of
truce, to whom Captaine Samp&s;on was &s;ent with
Captaine Goring, who comming to the &s;ayd Me&s;|&s;enger,
he fir&s;t asked them what nation they were,
they aun&s;wered Engli&s;hmen, he then required to
know if warres were betweene England &amp; Spaine,
to which they an&s;wered that they knew not, but if
he would go to their Generall he could be&s;t re&s;olue
him of &s;uch particulars, and for his a&s;&s;urance of pa&s;|&s;age
and repa&s;&s;age, the&s;e Captaines made offer to
ingage their credits, which he refu&s;ed for that he
was not &s;ent from his Gouernor. Then they tolde
him, if his Gouernor did de&s;ire to take a cour&s;e for
the common benefit of the people and contrie, his
be&s;t way were to come &amp; pre&s;ent him&s;elfe vnto our
Noble and merciful Gouernor Sir Frances Drake:
whereby he might be a&s;&s;ured to finde fauour, both
for him &s;elfe and the inhabitants. Otherwi&s;e within
three daies we &s;hould march ouer the land, and con|&s;ume
with fire all inhabited places, and put to the
&s;worde all &s;uch liuing &s;oules as we &s;hould chaunce
<PB N="16" REF="13">
vpon: &s;o thus much he tooke for the conclu&s;ion of
his an&s;wer, and departing, he promi&s;ed to returne
the next day, but we neuer heard more of him.</P>
<P>Vpon the foure and twentieth of Nouember, the
Generall accompanied with the Lieutenant gene|rall
and &s;ix hundred men, marched foorth to a vil|lage
twelue miles within the lande, called S. DO|MINGO,
where the Gouernor and the Bi&s;hop with
all the better &s;ort were lodged, and by eight of the
clocke we came to it, finding the place abandoned,
&amp; the people fled into the mountaines: &s;o we made
&s;tande a while to ea&s;e our &s;elues, and partly to &s;ee if
any would come to &s;peake to vs. After we had well
re&s;ted our &s;elues, the Generall commaunded the
troupes to march away homewardes, in which re|treat
the enemy &s;hewed them &s;elues, both hor&s;e &amp;
foote, though not &s;uch force as dur&s;t encounter vs:
and &s;o in pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time at the ga&s;e with them, it
waxed late and towards night, before we could re|couer
home to S. IAGO.</P>
<P>On Munday the &s;ix &amp; twentieth of Nouember,
the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the
boates, to v&s;e all diligence to imbarke the Armie
into &s;uch &s;hips as euery man belonged. The Lieute|nant

forces were wholly imbarked, the Vizeadmirall
making &s;tay with his Pinnace and certaine boates
in the harbour, to bring the &s;ayd la&s;t company a|boord
the &s;hips. Al&s;o the Generall willed foorth|with
the Gallie with two Pinnaces to take into the~
the company of Captaine Barton, and the compa|ny
of Captaine Bigs, vnder the leading of Captaine
Samp&s;on, to &s;eeke out &s;uch munition as was hidden
in the ground, at the towne of PRAY or PLAY, ha|uing
beene promi&s;ed to be &s;hewed it by a pri&s;oner,

comming to the PLAY, landed their men,
and hauing placed the troupe in their be&s;t &s;trength,
Captaine Samp&s;on tooke the pri&s;oner, and willed
him to &s;hewe that he had promi&s;ed, the which he
could not, or at lea&s;t would not: but they &s;earching
all &s;u&s;pected places, found two pieces of ordinance
one of yron, an other of bra&s;&s;e. In the after noone
the Generall anckered the re&s;t of the Fleete before

burne the towne and make all ha&s;te a boorde, the

and our &s;elues imbarked againe the &s;ame night, and
&s;o we put off to &s;ea Southwe&s;t.</P>
<P>But before our departure from the towne of S.
IAGO, we e&s;tabli&s;hed orders for the better gouern|ment
of the armie, euery man mu&s;tered to his Cape|taine,

of the action, and to yeeld due obedience vnto the

prouident coun&s;ell, and laying downe this good
foundation before hand, all things went forward
in a due cour&s;e, to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">chiuing of our happie en|terpri&s;e.</P>
<P>In all the time of our being here, neither the Go|uernor
for the king of Spaine, which is a Portingall,
neither the Bi&s;hop, who&s;e authoritie is great, nei|ther
any of the inhabitants of the towne or I&s;land e|uer
came at vs (which we expectected they &s;hould
haue done) to intreate vs to leaue them &s;ome part
of their needefull proui&s;ions, or at the lea&s;t, to &s;pare
the ruining of their towne at the going away. The
cau&s;e of this their vnrea&s;onable di&s;tru&s;t (as I do take
it) was the fre&s;h remembrance of the great wrongs
they had done to olde Mai&s;ter VVilliam Hawkins
of Plimouth, in the voyage he made fower or fiue
yeares before, when as they did both breake their
promi&s;e, and murdered many of his men, whereof
I iudge you haue vnder&s;tood, and therefore neede|le&s;&s;e
to be here repeated. But &s;ince they came not
at vs, we left written in &s;undry places, as al&s;o in the
Spitle hou&s;e (which building was onely appointed
<PB N="19" REF="16">
to be &s;pared) the great di&s;contentment and &s;corne
we tooke at this their refraining to come vnto vs, as
al&s;o at the rude maner of killing, and &s;auage kind of
handling the dead body of one of our boyes, found
by them &s;tragling all alone, from whom they had
taken his head and his heart, and had &s;tragled the
other bowels about the place, in a mo&s;t bruti&s;h and
mo&s;t bea&s;tly maner.</P>
<P>In reuenge whereof at our departing we con&s;u|med
with fire all the hou&s;es, a&s;well in the countrey
which we &s;awe, as in the towne of S. IAGO.</P>
<P>From hence putting ouer to the VVe&s;t Indies,
we were not many dayes at &s;ea, but there beganne
among&s;t our people &s;uch mortalitie, as in few daies
there were dead aboue two or three hundred men.
And vntil &s;ome &s;euen or eight dayes after our com|ming
from S. IAGO, there had not died anie one
man of &s;ickene&s;&s;e in all the Fleete: the &s;ickene&s;&s;e
&s;hewed not his infection wherewith &s;o many were
&s;troken, vntill we were departed thence, and then
&s;eazed our people with extreme hote burning and
continuall ague, whereof &s;ome verie fevve e&s;caped
vvith life, and yet tho&s;e for the mo&s;t part not vvith|out
great alteration and decay of their vvittes and
&s;trength for a long time after. In &s;ome that dyed
vvere plainely &s;hevved the &s;mall &s;pottes, vvhich are
often found vpon tho&s;e that be infected vvith the

plague, we were not aboue eighteene daies in pa&s;|&s;age
betweene the &s;ight of Sainct IAGO afore&s;aid,
and the I&s;land of DOMINICA, being the fir&s;t I&s;land
of the VVe&s;t Indies that we fell withall, the &s;ame be|ing
inhabited with &s;auage people, which goe all na|ked,
their skin couloured with &s;ome painting of a
reddi&s;h tawney, verie per&s;onable and hand&s;ome
&s;trong men, who doe admit little conuer&s;ation with
the Spaniards: for as &s;ome of our people might vn|der&s;tand
them, they had a Spaniard or twaine pri&s;o|ners
with them, neither doe I thinke that there is a|ny
&s;afety for any of our nation, or any other to be
within the limits of their commaundement, albeit
they v&s;ed vs very kindely for tho&s;e fewe houres of
time which we &s;pent with them, helping our folkes
to fill and carie on their bare &s;houlders fre&s;h water
from the riuer to our &s;hips boats, and fetching from
their hou&s;es, great &s;tore of Tobacco, as al&s;o a kinde
of bread, which they fed on, called Ca&s;&s;ado, verie
white and &s;auerie, made of the rootes of Ca&s;&s;ania.
In recompence whereof, we be&s;towed liberali re|wardes
of gla&s;&s;e, coloured beades and other things,
which we had found at Sainct IAGO, wherewith (as
it &s;eemed) they re&s;ted very greatly &s;atisfied, and
&s;hewing &s;ome &s;orowfull countenance when they
perceaued that we would depart.</P>
<P>From hence we went to another I&s;land VVe&s;t|ward
<PB N="21" REF="17">
of it, called Sainct CHRISTOPHERS I&s;land,
wherein we &s;pent &s;ome dayes of Chri&s;tmas, to re|fre&s;h
our &s;icke people, and to clean&s;e and aire our
&s;hips. In which I&s;land were not any people at all that
we could heare of.</P>
<P>In which time by the General it was adui&s;ed and
re&s;olued, with the con&s;ent of the Lieutenant gene|rall,
the Vizeadmirall, and all the re&s;t of the Cap|taines
to proceede to the great I&s;land of HISPA|NIOLA,
as well for that we knewe our &s;elues then
to be in our be&s;t &s;trength, as al&s;o the rather allured
thereunto, by the glorious fame of the Citie of S.
DOMINGO, being the aunciente&s;t and chiefe inha|bited
place in all that tract of country there abouts.
And &s;o proceeding in this determination, by the
way we met with a &s;mall Frigot, bound for the &s;ame
place, the which the Vizeadmirall tooke, and ha|uing
duly examined the men that were in her, there
was one found by whom we were aduerti&s;ed, the
hauen to be a barred hauen, and the &s;hore or lande
thereof to be well fortified, hauing a Ca&s;tle there|vpon
furni&s;hed with great &s;tore of artillerie, with|out
the daunger whereof, was no conuenient lan|ding
place with ten Engli&s;h miles of the Citie, to
which the &s;ayd Pilote tooke on him to conduct vs.</P>
<P>All things being thus con&s;idered on, the whole
forces were commaunded in the euening to im|barke
<PB N="22" REF="18">
them &s;elues into Pinnaces, boates, and other
&s;mall barkes appointed for this &s;eruice. Our &s;oul|diers
being thus imbarked, the Generall put him
&s;elfe into the barke Fraunces as Admirall, and all
this night we lay on the &s;ea, bearing &s;mall &s;aile vntil
our arriuall to the landing place, which was about
the breaking of the day, and &s;o we landed, being
New yeares day, nine or tenne miles to the VVe&s;t|wardes
of that braue Citie of S. DOMINGO: for at
that time nor yet is known to vs, any landing place,
where the &s;ea &s;urge doth not threaten to ouer&s;et a
Pinnace or boate. Our Generall hauing &s;eene vs all
landed in &s;afetie, returned to his Fleete, bequea|thing
vs to God, and the good conduct of Mai&s;ter
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, at which time, be|ing
about eight of the clocke, we began to march,
and about noone time, or towards one of the clock
we approched the towne, where the Gentlemen
and tho&s;e of the better &s;orte, being &s;ome hundred
and fiftie braue hor&s;es or rather more, began to pre|&s;ent
them &s;elues, but our &s;mall &s;hot played vpon
them, which were &s;o &s;u&s;tained with good propor|tion
of pikes in all partes, as they finding no part of
our troope vnprepared to receaue them (for you
mu&s;t vnder&s;tand they viewed all round about) they
were thus driuen to giue vs leaue to proceede to|wardes
the two gates of the towne, which were the
<PB N="23" REF="18">
next to the &s;eaward. They had manned them both,
and planted their ordinance for that pre&s;ent and
&s;udden alarum without the gates, and al&s;o &s;ome
troopes of &s;mall &s;hot in Ambu&s;cado vpon the high
way &s;ide. VVe deuided our whole force, being
&s;ome thou&s;and or twelue hundred men into two
partes, to enterpri&s;e both the gates at one in&s;tant,
the Lieutenant generall hauing openly vowed to
Captaine Powell (who led the troope that entred
by the other gate) that with Gods good fauour he
would not re&s;t vntill our meeting in the market
place.</P>
<P>Their ordinance had no &s;ooner di&s;charged vp|on
our neere approche, and made &s;ome execution
amonge&s;t vs, though not much, but the Leiutenant
generall beganne forthwith to aduaunce both his
voice of encoragment and pa&s;e of marching, the
fir&s;t man that was &s;laine with the ordinaunce being
verie neere vnto him &s;elfe, and thereupon ha&s;ted
all that he might to keepe them from the reaching
of the ordinaunce. And notwith&s;tanding their Am|bu&s;cadoes,
we marched or rather ranne &s;oe roundly
into them, as pell mell we entered the gates with
them, and gaue them more care euerie man to &s;aue
him&s;elfe by flight, then rea&s;on to &s;tand any longer
to their broken fight, we forthwith repaired to the
market place, but to be more truely vnder&s;tood
<PB N="24" REF="19">
a place of very faire &s;patious &s;quare ground before
the great Church, whither al&s;o came as had beene
agreed, Captaine Powell with the other troope,
which place with &s;ome part next vnto it we &s;treng|thened
with Barricados, &amp; there as the mo&s;t conue|nient
place a&s;&s;ured our &s;elues, the Citie being farre
too &s;patious for &s;o &s;mall and wearie a troope to vn|dertake

had the gard of the Ca&s;tle, hearing vs bu&s;ie about
the gates of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, abandoned the &s;ame,
&s;ome being taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ome flying away
by the helpe of boates, to the other &s;ide of the ha|uen,

our hands, who without all order or rea&s;on, &amp; con|trary

boy through the body with one of their hor&s;emens
&s;taues, with which wound the boy returned to the
Generall, and after he had declared the maner of
this wrongfull crueltie, died forthwith in his pre|&s;ence,
wherewith the Generall being greatly pa&s;&s;io|ned,
commanded the Prouo&s;t martiall, to cau&s;e a
couple of Friers, then pri&s;oners, to be caried to the
&s;ame place where the boy was &s;troken, accompa|nied

&s;hould no day pa&s;&s;e, wherein there &s;hould not two

<P>VVhereupon the day folowing, he that had bene
Captaine of the kings galley, brought the offendor

&s;ome other re&s;pects, we were content to accept of
fiue and twentie thou&s;and Duckets, of fiue &s;hillings

let the world know one very notable marke and to|ken,
of the vn&s;atiable ambition of the Spani&s;h King
and his nation, which was found in the kings hou&s;e,
wherein the chiefe Gouernour of that Citie and
countrey is appointed always to lodge, which was
this. In the comming to the hall or other roomes of
this hou&s;e, you mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;cend vp by a faire large
paire of &s;taires, at the head of which &s;taires is a hand|&s;ome
&s;patious place to walke in, &s;omewhat like vn|to
a gallerie, wherein vpon one of the walles, right
ouer again&s;t you as you enter the &s;ayd place, &s;o as
your eye ca~ not e&s;cape the &s;ight of it, there is de&s;cri|bed
&amp; painted in a very large Scutchion, the armes
of the king of Spaine, &amp; in the lower part of the &s;aid
Scutchion, there is likewi&s;e de&s;cribed a globe, con|taining
in it the whole circuite of the &s;ea and the

whereof the meaning was required to be knowne

&s;ome of our companie it was told them, that if the
Queene of England would re&s;olutely pro&s;ecute the
warres again&s;t the king of Spaine, he &s;hould be for|ced

grovven an ordinarie iudgement, vvhen one vvas
heard to &s;peake fooli&s;hly, to &s;ay he had bene &s;icke
of the Calentour, vvhich is the Spani&s;h name of
their burning ague: for as I told you before, it is a
verie burning &amp; pe&s;tilent ague. The originall cau&s;e
thereof, is imputed to the euening or fir&s;t night aire
which they tearme La &s;erena, vvherein they &s;ay and
<PB N="36" REF="27">
hold very firme opinion, that who &s;o is then abroad
in the open aire, &s;hall certainly be infected to the
death, not being of the Indian or naturall race of
tho&s;e countrey people: our people by holding their
watch, were thus &s;ubiected to the infectious aire,
which at S. IAGO was mo&s;t daungerous and dead|ly
of all other places.</P>
<P>VVith this inco~uenience of continuall mortality,
we were forced to giue ouer our inte~ded enterpri&s;e,
to go with NOMBRE DE DIOS, and &s;o ouerland
to PANNANIA, where we &s;houlde haue &s;troken
the &s;troke for the trea&s;ure, and full recompence of
our tediou&s;e trauailes. And thus at CARTAGENA
we toke our fir&s;t re&s;olution to returne homewards.</P>
<P>But while we were yet there, it happened one
day, that our watch called the Sentinell, vpon the
Church &s;teeple, had di&s;couered in the &s;ea a couple
of &s;mall barkes or boates, making in with the har|bour
of CARTAGENA, wherepo~ Captaine Moone
and Captaine Varney, with Iohn Grant the Mai&s;ter
of the Tyger, and &s;ome other &s;eamen, embarqued
them &s;elues in a couple of &s;mall Pinnaces, to take
them before they &s;hould come neare the &s;hore, at
the mouth of the harbour, le&s;t by &s;ome &s;tragling
Spaniards from the land, they might be warned by
&s;ignes from co~ming in, which fell out accordingly,
notwith&s;ta~ding al the diligence that our men could

v&s;e: for the Spani&s;h boates, vpon the &s;ight of our
Pinnaces comming towards them, ran them&s;elues
a &s;hore, and &s;o their men pre&s;ently hid them &s;elues
in the bu&s;hes hard by the &s;ea &s;ide, amonge&s;t &s;ome
others that had called them by &s;ignes thither. Our
men pre&s;ently without any due regard had to the
qualitie of the place, and &s;eeing no man of the Spa|niards
to &s;hew them &s;elues, aboorded the Spani&s;h
barkes or boates, and &s;o &s;tanding all open in them,
were &s;uddenly &s;hot at by a troope of Spaniards out
of the bu&s;hes, by which volley of &s;hot there were
&s;laine Captaine Varney, who died pre&s;ently, and
Captaine Moone, who died &s;ome fewe dayes after,

&s;o our folkes returned without their purpo&s;e, not
hauing anie &s;ufficient number of &s;ouldiers, with
them to fight on &s;hore. For tho&s;e men they carried
were all marriners to rowe, fewe of them armed, be|cau&s;e
they made accompt with their ordinance to
haue taken the barks well inough at &s;ea, which they
might full ea&s;ily haue done, without any lo&s;&s;e at all,
if they had come in time to the harbour mouth, be|fore

&s;hore.</P>
<P>During our abode in this place, as al&s;o a S. DO|MINGO,

other Gentlemen of the better &s;ort.</P>
<P>This towne of CARTAGENA we touched in the
out parts, and con&s;umed much with fire, as we had
done S. DOMINGO vpon di&s;contentments, and
for want of agreeing with vs in their fir&s;t treaties
touching their ran&s;ome, which at the la&s;t was con|cluded
betweene vs, &s;hould be a hundred and ten

<P>This towne (though not halfe &s;o bigge as S. DO|MINGO)
giues as you &s;ee, a farre greater ran&s;ome,
being in very deede of farre more importance, by
rea&s;on of the excellencie of the harbour, and the fit
&s;ituation thereof, to &s;erue the trade of NOMBRE

farre more rich merchants. The other is chiefly in|habited
with Lawyers and braue Gentlemen, being
the chiefe or highe&s;t appeale of their &s;utes in law of
all the I&s;lands about it, and of the maine land coa&s;t
next vnto it. And it is of no &s;uch accompt as CAR|TAGENA,
for the&s;e and &s;ome other like rea&s;ons,
which I could giue you, ouer long to be now writte~.</P>
<P>The warning which this towne receaued of our
<PB N="39" REF="28">
comming towards them, from S. DOMINGO, by
the &s;pace of twentie dayes before our ariuall hither,
was cau&s;e that they had both fortified &amp; euery way
prepared for their be&s;t defence. As al&s;o that they
had caried &amp; conueyed away all their trea&s;ure and
principall &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The ran&s;ome of an hundred and ten thou&s;and
Duckets thus concluded on, as is afore&s;ayd, the
&s;ame being written, &amp; expre&s;&s;ing for nothing more
then the towne of CARTAGENA, vpon the paiment
of the &s;ayd ran&s;ome, we left the &s;ayd towne, and
drewe &s;ome part of our &s;ouldiers into the Priorie or
Abbey, &s;tanding a quarter of an Engli&s;h mile be|lowe
the towne vpon the harbour water &s;ide, the
&s;ame being walled with a wall of &s;tone, which we
told the Spaniards was yet ours, and not redeemed
by their compo&s;ition: where upon they finding the
defect of their contract, were content to enter into
onother raun&s;ome for all places, but &s;pecially for
the &s;ayd hou&s;e, as al&s;o the blocke hou&s;e or Ca&s;tle,
which is vpon the mouth of the inner harbour. And
when we asked as much for the one as for the other,
they yeelded to giue a thou&s;and crownes for the
Abbey, leauing vs to take our plea&s;ure vpon the
blocke hou&s;e, which they &s;ayd they were not able
to raun&s;ome, hauing &s;tretched them &s;elues to the
vttermo&s;t of their powers: and therefore the &s;ayd
<PB N="40" REF="29">
blocke hou&s;e was by vs vndermined, and &s;o with
gun pouder blowen vp in peeces.</P>
<P>VVhile this latter contract was in making, our
whole Fleete of &s;hips fell downe towards the har|bour
mouth, where they ankered the third time, &amp;
employed their men in fetching of fre&s;h water a|boord
the &s;hips for our voyage homewardes, which
water was had in a great well, that is in the I&s;land by
the harbour mouth, which I&s;land is a verie plea&s;ant
place as hath bene &s;eene, hauing in it manie &s;orts of
goodly and very plea&s;ant fruits, as the orenge trees
and others, being &s;et orderly in walkes of great
length together. In&s;omuch as the whole I&s;land be|ing
&s;ome two or three miles about, is ca&s;t into
groundes of gardening and orchards.</P>
<P>After &s;ixe weekes abode in this place, we put to
&s;ea the la&s;t of March, where after two or three dayes
a great &s;hip which we had taken at S. DOMINGO,
and thereupon was called the New yeares gift, fell
into a great leake, being laden with ordina~ce, hides,
and other &s;poiles, and in the night &s;he lo&s;t the com|panie
of our Fleete, which being mi&s;&s;ed the next
morning by the Generall, he ca&s;t about with the
whole Fleete, fearing &s;ome great mi&s;chaunce to be
happened vnto her, as in verie deede it &s;o fell out,
for her leake was &s;o great, and her men were all ty|red
with pomping. But at the la&s;t hauing found her

and the Barke Talbot in her companie, which &s;tay|ing
by great hap with her, was readie to take their
men out of her, for the &s;auing of them. And &s;o the
Generall being fully aduerti&s;ed of their great extre|mitie,
made &s;aile directly backe againe to CARTA|GENA
with the whole Fleete, where hauing &s;tayed
eight or tenne dayes more, about the vnlading of
this &s;hip, and the be&s;towing thereof and her men,
into other &s;hips, we departed once againe to &s;ea,
directing our cour&s;e towards the Cape S. ANTHO|NIE,
being the Ea&s;termo&s;t part of CVBA, whither
we arriued the &s;euen &amp; twentieth of Aprill. But be|cau&s;e
fre&s;h water could not pre&s;ently be found, we
weyed anker and departed, thinking in fewe dayes
to recouer the MATTANCES, a place to the Ea&s;t|ward
of HAVANA.</P>
<P>After we had &s;ailed &s;ome fourteene dayes, we
were brought to Cape S. ANTHONIE againe, tho|rough
lacke of fauorable wind: but the~ our &s;car&s;itie
was growen &s;uch, as neede made vs looke a litle
better for water, which we found in &s;ufficient quan|titie,
being in deede, as I iudge, none other then
raine water newly fallen, and gathered vp by ma|king
pittes in a plot of marri&s;h ground, &s;ome three
hundred pa&s;es from the &s;ea &s;ide.</P>
<P>I do wrong if I &s;hould forget the good example
of the Generall at this place, who to encourage
<PB N="42" REF="30">
others, and to ha&s;ten the getting of fre&s;h water a|boord
the &s;hips, tooke no le&s;&s;e paine him &s;elfe then
the meane&s;t, as al&s;o at S. DOMINGO, CARTAGENA
and all other places, hauing alwayes &s;o vigilant a
care and fore&s;ight in the good ordering of his fleet,
accompanying them, as it is &s;ayd, with &s;uch won|derfull
trauell of bodie, as doubtle&s;&s;e had he bene
the meane&s;t per&s;on, as he was the chiefe&s;t, he had
yet de&s;erued the fir&s;t place of honour: and no le&s;&s;e
happie do we accompt him, for being a&s;&s;ociated
with Mai&s;ter Carleill his Lieutenant generall, by
who&s;e experience, prudent coun&s;ell, and gallant
performance, he atchiued &s;o many and happie en|terpri&s;es
of the warre, by whom al&s;o he was verie
greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in &s;etting downe the needefull or|ders,
lawes, and cour&s;e of iu&s;tice, and for the due
admini&s;tration of the &s;ame vpon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>After three dayes &s;pent in watering our &s;hips, we
departed now the &s;econd time from this Cape of S.
ANTHONIE the thirteenth of May, and proceeding
about the Cape of FLORIDA, we neuer touched
anie where, but coa&s;ting along&s;t FLORIDA, and
keeping the &s;hore &s;till in &s;ight, the eight and twen|tieth
of May early in the morning, we de&s;cried on
the &s;hore a place built like a Beacon, which was in
deede a &s;caffold vpon foure long ma&s;tes, rai&s;ed on
ende for men to di&s;couer to the &s;eaward, being in
<PB N="43" REF="30">
the latitude of thirtie degrees, or verie neare there|unto.
Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the
&s;hore, we marched vp along&s;t the riuer &s;ide, to &s;ee
what place the enemy held there: for none among&s;t
vs had any knowledge thereof at all.</P>
<P>Here the General tooke occa&s;ion to march with
the companies him &s;elfe in per&s;on, the Lieutenant
generall hauing the Vantgard, and going a mile vp
or &s;omewhat more by the riuer &s;ide, we might di|&s;cerne
on the other &s;ide of the riuer ouer again&s;t vs,
a fort, which newly had bene built by the Spaniards,
and &s;ome mile or there about aboue the fort, was a
litle towne or village without walles, built of wood|den
hou&s;es: we forthwith prepared to haue ordi|nance
for the batterie, and one peece was litle
before the euening planted, and the fir&s;t &s;hot being
made by the Lieutenant generall him &s;elfe at their
En&s;igne, &s;trake through the En&s;igne, as we after|wards
vnder&s;tood by a French man, which came
vnto vs from them. One &s;hot more was then made,
which &s;trake the foote of the fort wall, which was all
ma&s;&s;iue timber of great trees like ma&s;tes. The Lieu|tenant
generall was determined to pa&s;&s;e the riuer
this night with foure companies, and there to lodge
him &s;elfe intrenched as neare the fort, as that he
might play with his muskets and &s;malle&s;t &s;hot vpon
anie that &s;hould appeare: and &s;o afterwards to bring
<PB N="44" REF="31">
and plant the batterie with him, but the helpe of
marriners for that &s;udden to make trenches could
not be had, which was the cau&s;e that this determi|nation
was remitted vntill the next night.</P>
<P>In the night the Lieutenant general tooke a litle
rowing Skiffe, and halfe a do&s;en well armed, as
Captaine Morgan, and Captaine Samp&s;on, with
&s;ome others be&s;ides the rowers, and went to viewe
what gard the enemie kept, as al&s;o to take know|ledge
of the ground. And albeit he went as couertly
as might be, yet the enemy taking the Alarum, grew
fearefull that the whole Force was approching to
the a&s;&s;ault, and therefore with all &s;peede abando|ned
the place after the &s;hooting of &s;ome of their
pecces. They thus gone, and he being returned
vnto vs againe, but nothing knowing of their flight
from their fort, forthwith came a French man being
a Phipher (who had bene pri&s;oner with them) in a
litle boate, playing on his phiph the tune of the
Prince of Orenge his &s;ong, and being called vnto
by the gard, he tolde them before he put foote out
of the boate, what he was him &s;elfe, and howe the
Spaniards were gone from the &s;ort, offering either
to remaine in hands there, or el&s;e to returne to the
place with them that would go.</P>
<P>Vpon this intelligence the Generall, the Lieute|nant
generall, with &s;ome of the Captaines in one
<PB N="45" REF="31">
Skiffe, and the Vizeadmirall with &s;ome others in
his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furni&s;hed of
&s;ouldiers with them, put pre&s;ently ouer towards the
fort, giuing order for the re&s;t of the Pinnaces to fol|low.
And in our approch, &s;ome of the enemie bol|der
then the re&s;t, hauing &s;tayed behind their com|panie,
&s;hot off two peeces of ordinance at vs: but
on &s;hore we went, and entred the place without fin|ding
any man there.</P>
<P>VVhen the day appeared, we found it built all
of timber, the walles being none other then whole
ma&s;ts or bodies of trees &s;et vpright and clo&s;e toge|ther
in maner of a pale, without anie ditch as yet
made, but who intended with &s;ome more time, for
they had not as yet fini&s;hed all their worke, hauing
begun the &s;ame &s;ome three or fower moneths be|fore:
&s;o as to &s;ay the truth, they had no rea&s;on to
keepe it, being &s;ubiect both to fier and ea&s;ie a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The platforme whereon the ordinance lay, was
whole bodies of long pine trees, whereof there is
great plentie, layed a cro&s;&s;e one on another, and
&s;ome litle earth among&s;t. There was in it thirteene
or fourreene great peeces of bra&s;&s;e ordinance, and
a che&s;t vnbroken vp, hauing in it the value of &s;ome
two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, by e&s;timation of the
Kings trea&s;ure, to pay the &s;ouldiers of that place,
who were a hundred and fiftie men.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="32">
The fort thus wonne, which they called S. Iohns
fort, and the day opened, we a&s;&s;ayed to go to the
towne, but could not by rea&s;on of &s;ome riuers and
broken ground which was betweene the two pla|ces:
and therefore enforced to imbarke againe into
our Pinnaces, we went thither vpo~ the great maine
riuer, which is called as al&s;o the towne by the name
of S. AVGVSTINE.</P>
<P>At our approching to land, there was &s;ome that
began to &s;hewe them &s;elues, and to be&s;towe &s;ome
fewe &s;hot vpon vs, but pre&s;ently withdrewe them
&s;elues. And in their running thus away, the Sergeant
maior finding one of their hor&s;es readie &s;adled and
bridled, tooke the &s;ame to follow the cha&s;e, and &s;o
ouergoing all his companie, was (by one layed be|hind
a bu&s;h) &s;hot through the head, &amp; falling downe
therewith, was by the &s;ame and two or three more,
&s;tabbed in three or foure places of his bodie with
&s;words and daggers, before anie could come neere
to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being
in verie deede an hone&s;t wi&s;e Gentleman, and a
&s;ouldier of good experience, and of as great cou|rage
as anie man might be.</P>
<P>In this place called S. AVGVSTINE, we vnder|&s;tood
the King did keepe as is before &s;aid, one hun|dred
and fiftie &s;ouldiers, and at an other place &s;ome
dozen leagues beyond to the Northwardes, called

&s;hip, a Pinnace, and certaine boates with &s;ufficient
Mai&s;ters and mariners, together furni&s;hed witha
<PB N="49" REF="35">
moneths victuall to &s;tay and make farther di&s;coue|rie

anie other thing they would de&s;ire, &amp; that he might
be able to &s;pare.</P>
<P>Or el&s;e if they thought they had made &s;ufficient
di&s;couerie alreadie, and did de&s;ire to returne into
England, he would giue them pa&s;&s;age. But they as
it &s;eemed, being de&s;irous to &s;tay, accepted verie
thankefully, and with great gladne&s;&s;e that which
was offred fir&s;t. VVherupon the &s;hip being appoin|ted
&amp; receaued into charge, by &s;ome of their owne
companie &s;ent into her by Mai&s;ter Lane, before
