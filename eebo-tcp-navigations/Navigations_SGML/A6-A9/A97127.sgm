<HEAD>The la&s;t LETTERS From the NAVY:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SInce my la&s;t of the 8 in&s;tant, We are come to an anchor in the Te|xel, where we ride with great &s;afe|ty, offending the enemy, and defending our &s;elves; and ob&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;age of all &s;hips from pa&s;&s;ing either in or out. We have exchanged many hundreds of great &s;hot, and have allarum'd the whole Coun|trey,
<PB N="4" REF="3">e&s;pecially Holland, Zealand, and We&s;t-Friez|land. Whereupon their Land-forces are drawing down towards the Sea-coa&s;t to oppo&s;e Us, and we are preparing to receive them.</P>
<P>Vantrump hath &s;ent Orders and In&s;tructions to all the Court of Admiralties, requiring them forth|with to man out all &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els what&s;oever, that are fit for &s;ervice; and withall, each Captain to cut his way, and force his pa&s;&s;age through the Engli&s;h Fleet. Yet, notwith&s;tanding, we do not in the lea&s;t hear, that his high and mighty Excellen|cy, for&s;ooth, hath taken the Sacrament now, as he did in his former Enterpri&s;e, which was, To &s;weep the Narrow-&s;eas of all the Engli&s;h, and to burn, and &s;ink all &s;hips what&s;oever, belonging to this Com|mon-wealth, &amp;c. But divine providence fru&s;trated their implacable Re&s;olutions, and gave us &s;uch a mighty Victory again&s;t tho&s;e (who, a few dayes be|fore, were lifted up with their &s;ucce&s;s in getting out their Fleets for Trade, and bringing their &s;hips loa|den with Merchandi&s;e home in &s;afety, and in their braving it upon our coa&s;ts, &s;hooting again&s;t our towns and ca&s;tles in the ab&s;ence of our fleet) was a mo&s;t &s;ignal, and every way, a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable mer|cy.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>Since which memorable Defeat, the States Ge|neral have had &s;undry con&s;ultations, touching the &s;etting forth another fleet, and withall declared for the King of Scots Intere&s;t, and that his colours &s;hould be erected and &s;et up, &amp;c. Bu, truly, to &s;peak, truth, I humbly conceive, the Gentleman has more rational Knowledge and Ingenuity, then to repo&s;e the lea&s;t tru&s;t upon &s;uch a Rebellious and perfidi|ous people.</P>
<P>Great are their preparations for war throughout all the Netherlands; and exceedingly exa&s;perated are the Royal Party and Nobility; &s;o that &s;undry Declarations have been di&s;pierced and publi&s;hed, inciting the Engli&s;h, French, and Scots, to a conjun|ction with the Dutch, which, we hear, is re&s;olved upon, onely one ob&s;tacle hangs &s;hrewdly upon the Hinges, in reference to a commander in chief: the French and Walloons declare for the titular Duke of York; but the Engli&s;h and Scots declare for the Lord Craven, and Major General Mal&s;ey. What the Re&s;ult of the&s;e Debates will produce, I &s;hal re|fer you to a more &s;ea&s;onable Opportunity, and re|main</P>

<P>And &s;undry other places: They have al&s;o placed &s;trong Guards at the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable &s;luces, and are re&s;olv'd, if they can, to let in the &s;ea, and de&s;troy us by water, if we attempt to make our inroad into the Countrey. As for the Dorps which were &s;aid to be burned upon the landing of &s;ome of our men, I have not &s;een any Expre&s;s of credence to confirm it; Onely thus much we have by way of Tran&s;cript, that it is ve|ry certain the common &s;ort of people con|tinue in a great di&s;traction. The conte&s;tati|on is great betwixt tho&s;e of the Princes party, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vantrump, and the Lords of the States General, who now &s;igh after peace, and fain would have an accommoda|tion with England; but the Royal family declareth again&s;t them, and by way of im|peachment affirmeth, that during this exi|gencie of time great hath bin their confede|racy with the common enemie, in ob&s;tru|cting
<PB N="8" REF="5">the Maritine and Naval Affairs, by perverting many of the Captains, and &s;ub|verting divers of the &s;ouldiers, in an under|hand way that they &s;hould not engage a|gain&s;t us, and wholy impute the lo&s;ing of the day to their private negotiations with the Engli&s;h intere&s;t: no le&s;s then 37 Arti|cles of Impeachment and high trea&s;on are exhibited, printed, and publi&s;hed, again&s;t the States General, viz The
