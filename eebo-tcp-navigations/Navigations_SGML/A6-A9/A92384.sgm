<HEAD>A Relation of the whole proceedings concerning the redemption of the Captives in ARGEIR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AS nothing can demon&s;trate to the world the &s;incerity of the intenti|ons of a State better then their own publick actions: &s;o the pie|ty of their re&s;olutions can never be manife&s;ted more clearly, then when carried on through va|riety of difficulties: the truth whereof doth herein mo&s;t evidently appear. At the commence of this Parliament, while yet the kingdom was in peace, both Hou&s;es pa&s;&s;ed an Act, where|by they did manife&s;t unto the world their re&s;olutions of undertaking that Chri&s;tian work of the redemption of the Captives taken by Tur|ki&s;h, Moori&s;h, and other Pirats, from that cruel thraldome which they lay under: immediately after the pa&s;sing whereof, this unnaturall war was by the malice of the Kingdomes enemies formented and continued, and the whole King|dome
<PB N="6" REF="3">enwrapped in mi&s;ery, and to be redeem|ed by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, from the ty|rannicall oppre&s;sion which it groaned under. Whereby indeed that work of the redemption of the Captives was for a time interrupted in its progre&s;sion: and had the Parliament looked on thing only according to humane rea&s;on they might well have altogether deferred the under|taking at that time that &s;o great an action, refer|ring to a forein State, &s;o remote as Africa: yet with a proportionall equality of care to relea&s;e the whole, and its &s;everall part, tho&s;e principles that fir&s;t moved them, kept up their re&s;olutions in the mid&s;t of the &s;torme, yea quickned them on: To that purpo&s;e in the year 1645 they &s;et forth a &s;hip of &s;trength called the <HI>Honour,</HI> laden with a Garga&s;oon of money and goods, to a great va|lue: &s;ending <HI>Edmond Ca&s;on</HI> E&s;q. their Agent, with Power and in&s;tructions to go for Argier, to treat for the relea&s;e of the Engli&s;h Captives from thence, and &s;etling of a future peace, for &s;ecurity of the Marchants and Mariners voyage. But it &s;o plea&s;ed the Divine Providence (to who&s;e guidance all things &s;ubmit) that the &s;aid &s;hip) with her lading, comming to anchor, (by rea|&s;on of contrary windes,) in the Road of Gibral|tar,
<PB N="7" REF="3">was there by accident &s;et on fire, all po&s;si|ble means u&s;ed to quench it, but with no effect, the goods by violence of the inhabitants of the place taken away, and not by the Agent to be recovered: &s;ome monies that were &s;aved were put on board another Engli&s;h &s;hip called the <HI>Diamond,</HI> at that time riding in the Bay but the <HI>Diamond</HI> a while after, before her return to England, was ca&s;t away near <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and &s;o the monies there were lo&s;t. Thus one affliction is added to another, and mi&s;ery, like waves, tread one on the others heel: And now who could have otherwi&s;e thought, but that with this &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, the work it &s;elf would have been layd a&s;ide: but yet that great God that gave the fir&s;t motion, continued the re&s;olutions. And on con&s;i|dence of a good effect in the end this la&s;t year, 1646. Both Hou&s;es were plea&s;ed againe to &s;et forth a &s;hip of &s;trength, called the <HI>Charles,</HI> with a Garga&s;oon of money and goods: &s;ending the &s;aid <HI>Edmond Ca&s;on</HI> E&s;q. again their Agent with the like power and commi&s;sion at before, for to treat for redemption of the Captives, and &s;et|ling of a firme peace. In pro&s;ecution of which orders, the &s;aid Agent, &s;hip, and goods, procee|ded on the voyage, and God hath &s;o ble&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="8" REF="4">work that they arived at that Port in &s;afety: where after a long and difficult treaty, the Re|gi&s;ter of the Captives is taken, wherein are in|rolled the names of all that are upon that place, and the price for their ran&s;ome agreed on, as they fir&s;t co&s;t in the market: that Garga&s;oon of money and goods that was &s;ent out, hath by the Agent been &s;o well managed, as that 244 per&s;ons, men, women &amp; children, are redeem|ed and &s;ent home in the &s;aid &s;hip, the <HI>Charles:</HI> the Agent is con&s;trained to &s;tay there, untill &s;uch time as the remainder are likewi&s;e redeemed. In preparation to the di&s;patch wherof, two &s;hips are now providing to be &s;ent thither with a greater Garga&s;oon then before: and to the in|tent that all may receive &s;atisfaction concerning the proceedings of the treaty, the number of the per&s;ons there captives, the names of the per&s;ons redeemed and brought home. The cour&s;e taken for, tho&s;e at Tunnis, here followeth, the extract of the Letters of the Agent Mr. <HI>Ca&s;on,</HI> the Li&s;t of the per&s;ons redeemed, and the tran&s;lation in Eng|li&s;h of the Letters from the Ba&s;ha, the Duana, the Mufty, Caddee and Shoudes, unto both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>An Extract out of the Letters of EDMOND CASON E&s;q; the Par|liaments Agent at Argier, directed unto the Committee of the Navy, dated the 29 of October, 1646.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>_MAy it plea&s;e you, we arived at this Port in &s;afety, thanks be to GOD, the 21 of September; the Ba&s;ha and Duana &s;ent me a &s;afe conduct the next day: I went on &s;hoar, and deli|vered my Letters to the Ba&s;ha, who had order from the Duana to treat with me, and de&s;ired to know my bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;o I delivered him, and &s;ome of the Duana my credentiall Letters, and then advi&s;ed them my commands from the Par|liament, both for complaints, and the joyning perpetuall peace, and de&s;ired the &s;ubjects of Eng|land to be delivered unto me free, for wee had
<PB N="10" REF="5">not broke the peace with them: they an&s;wered they con&s;ented a peace, but the Slaves were &s;old unto divers men, &s;ouldiers, and others, who would not deliver them without paying for them what they fir&s;t co&s;t in the market, as &s;hould appear by their books. Being not content with this an&s;wer, I de&s;ired my Letters (being then tran&s;lated) to be read in the Duana, to have the an&s;wer from the Ba&s;ha and Duana when they were in councell, the which they con&s;ented: the next Saturday (being the day of their &s;itting) the 26 <HI>Ditto,</HI> I had the &s;ame an&s;wer by the Trudgeman; and for all things I was againe ap|pointed to treat with the Ba&s;ha, this day the peace was concluded and proclaimed in the Duana.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;ha entertained me with all courte&s;ie, fea&s;ted me at his hou&s;e, and afterwards in the fields.</P>
<P>Then I de&s;ired to take a regi&s;ter of all the Engli&s;h there detained as Captives; and that e|very owner of an Engli&s;h captive might come with his &s;lave before me, and a Scrivener of this place to declare his &s;laves name, and what he co&s;t him the fir&s;t penny, the which was re|gi&s;tred by us both; and further took the place he
<PB N="11" REF="5">was of, his age, and what &s;hip he was taken in, and how many years pa&s;t. I was informed that divers Turks and Moores cau&s;ed us to &s;et down much more then their &s;laves co&s;t, the which I did advi&s;e the Ba&s;ha; he &s;wore by the head of his ma&s;ter, the great Turk, I &s;hould pay not an A&s;per more then they co&s;t in the market, at the fir&s;t &s;ale when they were brought on &s;hoar. The regi&s;ter being taken of tho&s;e which be here, there are 650 and upwards, be&s;ides above an too in the &s;hips of this place, now at Candia in the &s;ervice of the great Turk. And after payment of the 10000 dollors, bagreed to give him &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> for what money I &s;hould import to pay the ran|&s;ome of &s;laves, otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have paid ten <HI>per cent.</HI> Then al&s;o we agreed for his duties for ex|portation of the &s;laves 20 Pe&s;as <HI>per</HI> man to the Ba&s;ha, and to the Officers half duties; all which comes unto 31&frac12; Dollars <HI>per</HI> &s;lave, without agree|ment they would have co&s;t about 50 Dollars a man for charges.</P>
<P>Divers of the Engli&s;h Youths bee turned Turks, through beating and hard u&s;age; and di|vers children, the which they keep very gallant, but the young men (after turned) they carry to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and other parts to the Ea&s;twards.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="6">
<P>Now for the freeing of the Captives, my de|&s;ire is, that it may be done with all brevity, and with ready money, while&s;t this Ba&s;ha is here. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants had rather keep their &s;laves then permit them to be freed: they come to much more <HI>per</HI> head then I expe|cted, the rea&s;on is, here be many women and children which co&s;t 50 l. <HI>per</HI> head fir&s;t penny, and might &s;ell them for an 100. Be&s;ides them there are divers which were Ma&s;ters of &s;hips and Carpenters, Caulkers, Coopers, Sailemakers, Chirurgions, and others which are here highly e&s;teemed; &s;o that they doe come unto 32 l. <HI>per</HI> man fir&s;t penny, as they have rated them one with another, and the port charges is 6 l: 6 s. <HI>per</HI> head, &s;o they will be about 38 l. <HI>per</HI> head put a &s;hip board. I de&s;ired to have agreed with them at a certain price one with another, old &amp; yong; That they would not con&s;ent unto, aleaging, that they were bought at &s;everall prices, and it would make trouble among&s;t them: the King hath promi&s;ed I &s;hall not be wronged.</P>
<P>I have all things under their hands and &s;eals; the originall peace according to the ancient capitulations renewed under the hand of the Ba&s;ha, Duana, as al&s;o under the hand and &s;eal
<PB N="13" REF="6">of the Mu&s;ty and Caddee, and Shoudes, which be principall Ju&s;tices of the peace.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t was 29 October: They of this place doe expect that our &s;hips &s;hould not defend any other Nation which &s;hal bee in our Company from the &s;hips of this place. I thought to have taken away the bet|ter &s;ort of the people fir&s;t, and the re&s;t afterwards, the which I under&s;tood to be the command gi|ven me: but it plea&s;ed God &s;o to order, that I mu&s;t take away tho&s;e I could have for cloth, and leave the re&s;t till afterwards. The Ba&s;ha plea&s;ed to tell me, when we had difference, that &s;eeing I had taken the Regi&s;ter of the Engli&s;h, and their price, I &s;hould clear them before I went hence.</P>
<P>For the money &s;et down, I per&s;wade my &s;elf you &s;hall have your people free; for both Spani|ards and French have their protections perfor|med, when they come to clear &s;laves from this place:</P>

I be&s;eech your Honors not to think that this redemption may be part one year, and part another: and I de&s;ire your people may go home in Summer, for I do a&s;&s;ure you, their clothes be thin.
