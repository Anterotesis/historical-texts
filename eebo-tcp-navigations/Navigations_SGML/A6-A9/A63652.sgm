<P>THE Ship <HI>Adventure,</HI> of which <HI>Thomas Gullock</HI> was Commander and <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI>
bound to <HI>Borneo</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> broke ground from <HI>Graves-End</HI> on the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>March</HI>
1697/8. and toucht at <HI>Brava</HI> one of the <HI>Cape de Verdy</HI> I&s;lands, and having there got
plenty of Refre&s;hment, Fowls, Hogs, Goats and green Trade, proceeded on their
Voyage, and in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> fell in with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> went to <HI>Padang</HI> to get
Refre&s;hment for the Ships Company, lay there five days, bought there four Bullocks, Fowls,
Fruit, green Herbs, Potato's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was equally divided to the Ships Company, al&s;o about a
Tun and half of Rice, and half a Butt of <HI>Arack,</HI> got one Boat-load of Water, and &s;ail'd thence;
about 20 days after, being by calms and currents driven near <HI>Naias,</HI> an I&s;land inhabited by a
barbarous &s;ort of People who have no Commerce with any <HI>Europeans,</HI> came to an Anchor, the
Captain order'd the Long boat on &s;hoar with empt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cask to fill Water, under the charge of
Mr. <HI>William Hill</HI> his &s;econd Mate, with 24 Men well arm'd, with orders that if a Gale of Wind
&s;hould &s;pring up, or that they &s;hould &s;ee any Natives or tracks of them upon the Sand, then im|mediately
to repair on Board without Water, being in no great want of it, but thought <HI>that</HI>
the be&s;t u&s;e could be made of the time whil&s;t lying at an Anchor. After the Long-boat was
put off, the Captain was in great perplexity le&s;t the Boats-crew might be de&s;troyed by the
barbarous Natives, therefore went on &s;hoar him&s;elf in his Yaul after them, and &s;tay'd at the
watering place, being two or three hundred yards di&s;tant from the Boat, until Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> &s;ent
him word the Water-cask were full; the Captain then &s;ent him orders to &s;end the Long-boat
on board with fifteen Men; <HI>Jo&s;eph Bradi&s;h</HI> Boat&s;wains mate de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> to let him have the
Yaul to tow the Long boat off from the &s;hoar, which he agreed to, intending only the Secu|rity
of the Boat, but they continued to tow much farther than nece&s;&s;ary, and then ca&s;t off the
Tow-rope, laying the Yauls Head to the &s;hoar, with only two Men as appear'd in her; when

John Lloyd, Thomas Hughs</HI> and others, &s;eize Mr. <HI>Abraham Parrott</HI> the chief Mate, telling him he
was their Pri&s;oner, and the Ship and all that was in her was their own. He asked them what
was the matter, and what they thought would be the end of it? They an&s;wered he need not
trouble him&s;elf about that, they were for <HI>A &s;hort Life and a merry one.</HI> The Con&s;pirators being
immediately arm'd, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Ship, cut her Cable, loo&s;ed her Sails, and run
away with her, leaving the Captain and 14 Men upon the &s;aid I&s;land, expo&s;ed to inexpre&s;&s;iable
Mi&s;eries and Dangers, not only from the barbarous Natives, but Tygers and other wild Bea&s;ts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any manner of Provi&s;ions, Moneys or Cloaths, except the wor&s;t, which they had
on their backs, or any pro&s;pect of returning to their Native Country, or indeed of &s;o much as
pre&s;erving their Lives.</P>
<P>Soon after the Ship was under Sail, they turn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Yaul away, and in her five Men, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Dru Hacker, Rex Kempson, George Reyner, Jona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Grizley,</HI> and <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> being &s;uch
as would not joyn with them in their Villainous De&s;ign, not giving them one Bisket Cake,
or any Su&s;tenance, but refu&s;ed to let them go to their own Che&s;ts to put on a Coat, Hat, or
<PB N="2" REF="2">
Shoes, in&s;omuch that three were turned a&s;hoar without Coats or Hats, and two without Shoes,
and being forced to travel over &s;harp Rocks, they, with others who&s;e Shoes &s;oon wore out,
had their Feet torn and mangled, and bled in &s;uch a mi&s;erable manner, that they de&s;ired to
lye down and dye there, rather then to have gone on, if the Captain had not over per&s;wa|ded
them.</P>
<P>The number left in this deplorable &s;tate were 16 of their fellow Seamen, with the Comman|der
and three Merchants, who, be&s;ides the extream danger of peri&s;hing there, were rob'd of
what they had aboard, fru&s;trated of the fruits of their Voyage, and their poor Wives and
Children left to &s;tarve at home. Eight have &s;ince peri&s;hed by hunger and hard&s;hips, who, if
they were pre&s;ent, would more livelily &s;et out the horrid Cruelty of tho&s;e unmerciful Men
who run away with the Ship, and left them in that mi&s;erable and wretched Condition.</P>
<P>This di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Company being thus left, without any thing to eat, did remain &s;o from <HI>Sa|turday</HI>
morning the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> till <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> evening the <HI>22th.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the Barbarity of their fellow Seamen left them in &s;uch un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s, yet it
plea&s;ed God wonderfully to bring about Means for the Pre&s;ervation of a few of them to be
Witne&s;&s;es of &s;o horrid a Villany; for there happened to come two Boats to the &s;aid I&s;land, which
the Captain did hire with the Promi&s;e of 500 Pieces of Eight to pur&s;ue his Ship, and was on
<HI>Munday</HI> the <HI>19th</HI> within 4 or 5 Miles of her, but by a &s;udden Storm was forced a&s;hoar, and both
tho&s;e Boats &s;taved to pieces, only him&s;elf with 5 Men in the Yaul e&s;caped that Ship-wrack.
But it plea&s;ed God none of them lo&s;t their Lives, but all came by Land to a Creek or Cove,
whither the Captain with much toil and difficulty got in the Yaul; the Number was now
by the&s;e <HI>Atcheeners</HI> encrea&s;ed to 42 Men, and no Boat or Ve&s;&s;el but the Yaul, which could
not carry in the Sea above Eight or Ten. The <HI>Atcheeners</HI> &s;eem'd mo&s;t afraid of the Natives,
begging the Captain to &s;tand by them, or el&s;e the Natives would either kill or make Slaves of
him and them; for they &s;aid there was a Boat of <HI>Atcheen</HI> which came there the Year before,
the Men of which the Natives had knockt on the head, and halled the Boat up above High|water
mark; this Boat was &s;urvey'd and found much rent with the Sun, but that the <HI>Malayers</HI>
undertook to &s;top, and did &s;o, with Mo&s;s, Bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whil&s;t the Captain took care to get the
Sail and &s;ome other things of one of the wrack'd Boats, and did Launch her that day, (tho'
whil&s;t they were about it they were attack'd by 200 of the Natives, all arm'd with Swords,
Targets, and Launces, who made a fierce on&s;et, but by firing Twelve or Fourteen &s;hot
were put to flight) and with her and the Yaul got off to &s;mall I&s;lands call'd <HI>Maroos,</HI> where
they got &s;ome Coker Nuts, and from a Boat they met at tho&s;e I&s;lands got &s;ome Rice
which had been wet with Salt water in the &s;ame Storm when the two Boats were lo&s;t, and
was heated and &s;tank abominably, but was eaten heartily: This Boat pretended to belong to
<HI>Padang,</HI> &s;o that the Captain agreed with the Ma&s;ter for tran&s;port to <HI>Padang,</HI> giving the launch'd
Boat to the <HI>Acheeners</HI> in lieu of their two Boats, which was all the Recompence he could
then po&s;&s;ibly make them. Going with this Boat toward <HI>Sumatra</HI> they were cha&s;ed with a
<HI>Malaya</HI> Pirate, who came up with them, but &s;eeing them &s;tand to their Arms bore up round,
and &s;tood away without one word. Coming near <HI>Priaman</HI> there is a Shoal upon which the
<HI>Malayar</HI> ran his Boat; and when the Boat was on ground, the <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> all leapt over Board
to go to a dry Spot not far di&s;tant, but many had like to have been drown'd by holes in the
Rocks, which dipt them over head and ears, but others who could Swim a&s;&s;i&s;ted and got them
&s;afe to the dry Spot. The Captain went on &s;hoar with the Yaul, and begg'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Corporal, who &s;ent a Boat with Natives, which brought the Men all off from that
Spot, which not long after was overflown with the Tide, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have been
drowned; for the <HI>Malayar,</HI> after they jumpt out, got his Boat off, and went away without &s;tay|ing
to expect his Freight, for what rea&s;on we know not. Two days after they went to <HI>Padang,</HI>
where being ill treated, and labouring under great Want and Sickne&s;s, three &s;oon died there.
But it plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e them up there a Friend indeed, Mr. <HI>Antony Gillis</HI> a Native of <HI>India,</HI>
who pitied their Mi&s;eries, relieved their Wants, and (under God) &s;aved their Lives; who&s;e
inexpre&s;&s;ible and almo&s;t inimitable Charity, extended to the Dead and Living, &s;hrowding the
one, and &s;uccouring the other, which is here mention'd to his honour, and in gratitude to him.</P>
<P>The remaining part of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Company got their Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Bencoolen,</HI> whereof one
died by the way, and &s;ome remain'd there, of which three more &s;oon died, and it is to be
fear'd &s;everal of the re&s;t which &s;taid there are &s;ince dead, for only &s;ix of the Company pro|ceeded
to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where, after a langui&s;hing Sickne&s;s, died one more, <HI>viz. George Rayner,</HI>
from which place the Commander and three more got pa&s;&s;age to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing Account is given, not only by the Commander and poor &s;urviving Seamen,
but was (long before the taking of any of the wicked Crew who run away with the Ship) writ|ten
from <HI>Padang</HI> in a Letter to the Owners by Mr. <HI>Robert Anby</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ralph Peck,</HI> two Gentle|men,

have permitted the following Paragraphs to be printed with this Narrative.</P>

<P>NOW, honoured Sirs, we humbly crave your leave to do our worthy Captain Ju&s;tice, by
acquainting you of his particular care of the Ships Company, in re&s;pect to the health both of their
Souls and Bodies; we never failed of Morning and Evening Prayers in publick upon the Quarter Deck,
when the Weather would permit, our Commander daily endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s all manner of Vice, and
to encourage Vertue. As to the health of their Bodies, he was as tender as a Mother to any that were
&s;ick, daily minding the Doctor of his charge; and when he had fre&s;h Provi&s;ions at his own Table, would
ask the Doctor who was &s;ick, and always &s;ent them &s;ome. Tho&s;e that were in health he endeavoured to
keep &s;o, by refre&s;hing twice or thrice a day in bad weather with Drams. In fine, God Almighty knows
our hearts that we &s;peak the truth; he is the mo&s;t religious, &s;ober, careful and kind Commander that we
knew or heard of ever.</P>

writes thus:</P>

<P>I Do declare that I never &s;aw in any of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, or any other where I have been, better
Victuals or Victualling, nor never &s;o much care taken, nor kindne&s;s &s;hewn, both toward Soul and
Body, as was by the Commander, both to well and &s;ick; for tho' it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s us with &s;o health|ful
a Pa&s;&s;age, that we never had any Man lay down three days together, yet hath the Captain often
circumvented me in &s;ending Broth or other fre&s;h Provi&s;ions to &s;ick Men from his own Table, and hath
&s;undry times ordered Fowls to be kill'd expre&s;ly for them only, and hath al&s;o &s;everal times in the Voyage
given of his Fowls to the whole Ships Company, and never kill'd a Hogg, but a great part was given
them; and the &s;ame by his Par&s;nips, Carrots, Pumkins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> allowing for the &s;ick Men Water grewel
with Fruit, Sugar and Spice, &s;uch as I thought fit. In&s;omuch that I am ready to give Oath, I have

careful of his Men.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he &s;o husbanded the Brandy allowed for them that they had Drams always when wet, and at the
turning out of the Watches. And the Ships Company drank all Beer until near the Southern Tropick,
and to the Ea&s;tward of the Cape, and then Beer and Water to the very la&s;t, giving the Seamen &s;ome|times
&s;trong Beer. As for Abu&s;es I never &s;aw any or le&s;s &s;triking in any Ship where I have been, the
whole amounting to the puni&s;hment of four or five Per&s;ons, and that for great Faults, as Thievery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

two Cans of good Beer and Water; and when they drank Water, there was a Cask with a

that they had 28 pound of Bread <HI>per</HI> Week every Me&s;s, until <HI>John Lloyd</HI> de&s;ired the Cap|tain
to let him put two bags of Bread about 50 pound each, (which his Me&s;s alone

then they were at no Allowance for a Fortnight or three Weeks, but had the Bread in an open

<P>As for Cha&s;ti&s;ement, he did acknowledge that <HI>Ham Edgell</HI> and <HI>Wetherell</HI> had been
puni&s;hed; <HI>Edgell</HI> becau&s;e that he being a Quarter-Ma&s;ter, working in the <HI>Lazaretta,</HI> did break
open a Box, and &s;tole about a dozen pound of white Suger; the next day the Captain de|manded
at once all Keys of Che&s;ts, and did find the Sugar in his Che&s;t: which Felony he
thought fit publickly to puni&s;h, e&s;pecially in him, who being a Quarter-Ma&s;ter, might have the
opportunity of the &s;ame Fact in Goods of far greater value, and that it might prove exempla|ry
to the whole Ships Company.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Ham</HI> purely for the welfare of tho&s;e who complain again&s;t it, becau&s;e that he after
many checks, and &s;ome blows, continued na&s;ty to that degree, that upon a complaint of the
copperi&s;hne&s;s of the Pea&s;e, the Captain him&s;elf went into the Cook-room, and took off the
&s;ides of the Copper a great quantity of Verdigree&s;e, for which the Captain beat him with a
Japan Cane, but not to that degree as at all to wound or break his Skin, as the Chirurgeon's Mate,
Mr. <HI>We&s;tby</HI> confirmed upon Oath. And <HI>Witherell</HI> was beaten for &s;triking the Boat&s;wain of the
Ship. And if Correction in &s;uch Ca&s;es be not u&s;ed aboard Ships, no order can be maintain'd,
but all would run into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And the&s;e very Men them&s;elves, &s;ometime after Sei&s;ure of the Ship, did &s;ei&s;e the &s;ame <HI>Edward
Ham</HI> to the Gang-way, and &s;everely beat him for the &s;ame Crime.</P>
