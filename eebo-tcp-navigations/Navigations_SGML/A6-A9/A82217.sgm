<PB N="2" REF="3">of the Mariners, a great di&s;traction would &s;uddenly break forth among&s;t them new Coles being already kindling, which are ready to break forth in a vi&s;ible flame.</P>
<P>For we hear, that they mutiny exceedingly, and have declared, That they will not engage again&s;t the Parlia|ments Navy without a&s;&s;urance both of pre&s;ent and fu|ture &s;atisfaction; in&s;omuch, that many of them have undantedly remon&s;trated to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and other &s;uperiour Officers, that they will rather die and &s;uffer martyrdome, then be en&s;laved and ruled by a u&s;urping power and arbytrary Government.</P>
<P>This &s;trange allarum &s;oundeth in the eares of many like a terrible eccho, and puts a great demur to the proceedings at Court, many of the Grandees declining Engagement; e&s;pecially &s;ince the receipt of the In|telligence, that the parliaments Navy are put forth to Sea who are joyntly re&s;olved to hazard the encounter, and to bring them to obedience and &s;ubjection, who have perfidiou&s;ly de&s;erted, and betrayed the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>And by an Expre&s;&s;e from <HI>Helver-&s;luce</HI> it is further intimated, that upon the lanching forth of the parlia|ments &s;hips to the Ocean, they &s;oon e&s;pyed a Squadron of the princes Fleet, all under &s;ayl, being about &s;ixteen in number, who making towards them, and comming within &s;hot, gave them a broad &s;ide, which by rea&s;on of a &s;econd Volley from the a&s;&s;aulted, a hot conflict began, being di&s;puted with great re&s;olutene&s;&s;e and gal|lantry on both &s;ides, the Victory &s;eeming a long while doubtfull, but at la&s;t it fell to the parliamenteers, who &s;unk one of their Combitants, cha&s;ed the re&s;t many
<PB N="3" REF="3">leagues, and are now become Ma&s;ters of a great part of the Briti&s;h Seas.</P>
<P>This is reported here with great confidence, and it is verily believed, the re&s;t will not &s;tand a fight, divers of them fearing, that they &s;hall be made exemplary, if e|ver they be taken. Col. <HI>Popham</HI> one of the parliaments Admirals, hath cleered the We&s;tern Coa&s;t neere the I&s;le of <HI>Portland,</HI> and forced many to fly before him.

<P>Since the writing of my la&s;t, the two extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adours from Sweden and Denmark have had audience with the titufar King of Scotland, repre&s;enting the per&s;onall appearance of their Ma&s;ters, and promi&s;ing him a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the ob|taining of his Birthright. But truly we cannot di&s;cerne any vi&s;ible Force as yet in Armes, and the Princes Propo&s;itions to the old Souldiers of the United Pro|vinces are much &s;lighted and rejected, having unani|mou&s;ly declared, that they will not any wayes inter|meddle with the affairs of <HI>England,</HI> in relation to the erecting and &s;etting up of Monarchy or any other Go|vernment what&s;oever. Here is a great demur hapned, at Court, by rea&s;on of the Parliaments Navy putting forth to Sea, which cau&s;eth many who at fir&s;t &s;eemed very forward to promote the Royall De&s;ign, to de&s;ert any further Engagement, taking a pre&s;ident by the late headle&s;&s;e members, who acted again&s;t the Common|wealth of <HI>England.</HI></P>
