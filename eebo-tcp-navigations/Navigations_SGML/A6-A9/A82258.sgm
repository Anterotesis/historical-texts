<HEAD>A <HI>Declaration</HI> &s;et forth by the Lord <HI>Lieutenant</HI> the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the Councell and a&s;&s;embly occa|&s;ioned from the view of a prin|ted paper <HI>Entituled an Act prohi|biting trade with</HI> the <HI>Barbados, Virgi|nia, Bermudes</HI> and <HI>Antegoe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Lord <HI>Lieutenant Generall</HI> together which the <HI>Gentle|men</HI> of this Councell and a&s;&s;embly having carrefully peru&s;ed the &s;ayd printed paper and finding therein matter &s;o highly concerning the <HI>freedome, happine&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>wellfaire</HI> of this <HI>I&s;lande</HI> thought it their duty to Communi|cate the &s;ame unto all the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this place together which their <HI>ob&s;ervations</HI> and <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> upon the &s;ame, and for the better and more methodical proceding therein they have fir&s;t ordered the &s;ame to be publikly read as followeth.</P>
<P>Thus farre goes the &s;ayd Act by which the meane&s;t under&s;tanding may be &s;en&s;ible into how low an abject a bondage, the force of it would (if not prevented) reduce the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this <HI>I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="2"> I. For fir&s;t <HI>they do Alleadge that this I&s;land was &s;etled at the co&s;t and char|ges of the People of England, and therefore ought to be &s;ubjected to the people of England.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly we all know that we the now <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this <HI>I&s;land</HI> were and &s;till are tho&s;e People of <HI>England</HI> the which with great hazard of out <HI>per&s;ons</HI> and at our great <HI>co&s;t</HI> and <HI>charges</HI> have &s;etled and inhabited this place and shall we therfore be &s;ub|jected to the wills of tho&s;e that &s;tay at home? Shall we be bound by the regulations of the <HI>Parliament</HI> in which we have no <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> no <HI>per&s;ons</HI> there cho&s;en by us to propo&s;e or con&s;ent to what is good for us or to oppo&s;e, or di&s;pute what is not for our benefit or behoofe? certainly this were a Slauish im|po&s;ition beyond what Englishmen ever yet &s;ufferd &amp; we doubt not but tho&s;e courages which have brought us &s;o farre from our <HI>Native Soile</HI> and found us out a living in the&s;e wild woods will &s;till keep us <HI>freemen</HI> (whithout which) our lives will be but loth&s;ome to us.</P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly <HI>it is alleaged you the inhabitans of this I&s;land have by &s;ubtilty and force u&s;urped a power of Gouvernment.</HI></P>
<P>Had we the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this <HI>I&s;land</HI> ben heard what we could have &s;ayd, this allegation had never been printed. But tho&s;e who are de&s;igned to be &s;laves mu&s;t not have the priviledge otherwi&s;e we could have &s;ayd and mo&s;t truly can &amp; do averr that the <HI>Gouvernment</HI> now if of force among&s;t us is the &s;ame that hath ben con&s;tantly <HI>adhered</HI> unto, and <HI>obeyed</HI> ever &s;ince the &s;etling this place and given unto us by the &s;ame Authority which gave <HI>New England</HI> theirs, again&s;t whom the &s;ayd Act
<PB REF="3">objecteth nothing, and this <HI>Gouvernment</HI> now obeyed here is the neare&s;t moddell and re&s;&s;emblance (now left in the world) of that admirable forme under which all our <HI>Ance&s;tours</HI> of the <HI>English Nation</HI> florished for at lea&s;t one thou&s;and yeares pa&s;t, &amp; therfore we shall conclude the rules of logick and di&s;covrie to be &s;trangly inverted, if the <HI>Continuance</HI> of, and <HI>Submi&s;sion</HI> to the &s;ettled rightfull <HI>Gouvernment</HI> be adjudged an u&s;urpation of new power, and on the <HI>Contrary</HI> an <HI>V&s;urpation</HI> of a new <HI>Gouvernment</HI> and be held a <HI>Continuance</HI> of the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly <HI>by the &s;ayd Act all Forraigners are prohibited from holding any commerce with the inhabitans of this I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas all the old <HI>Planters</HI> well know how much they have ben beholding to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and how difficult it would have ben (without their a&s;&s;i&s;tances) ever to have &s;ettled this place &amp; even to this day we are &s;en&s;ible what nece&s;&s;ary comforts they bring us and how much cheaper they &s;ell their <HI>Commodities</HI> to us then our owne Nation; but this comfort mu&s;t be taken from us by them who&s;e will mu&s;t be our law: But we do <HI>Declare</HI> that we will never be &s;o ungratefull to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for former helps as to deny them or any other Na|tion the freedome of our <HI>Ports</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of our <HI>Lawes</HI> wher|by they may &s;till (&amp; if they plea&s;e) embrace a free <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> with us.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fourthly to compleat our de&s;igned bondage, and make our necks willing to receive the yoake <HI>our owne Countremen are likewi&s;e prohibited from trade and corre&s;pondency with us and none to come
<PB REF="3">neare us but &s;uch as have a particular licen&s;e, from &s;ome per&s;ons for that pur|po&s;e appointed.</HI></P>
<P>By which meanes it may come to pa&s;&s;e that no <HI>goods</HI> or <HI>com|modities</HI> shall be brought hither but &s;uch as tho&s;e <HI>licen&s;ed per&s;ons</HI> shall plea&s;e to be &s;old at the <HI>prizes</HI> that they shall <HI>impo&s;e;</HI> and no ships but theris arrive here, &s;o that no <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> shall be able to &s;end home the <HI>Native Commodities</HI> of this place for their owne account but be as meerely &s;laves to that Com|pany that shall have the &s;ayd licen&s;e as our <HI>Negroes</HI> are to us, they making theirs the whole advantage of our labours and indu&s;tries here. And therfore upon the whole matter we do declare that as on the one &s;ide we will not be wanting to u&s;e all the <HI>hone&s;t honorable,</HI> and <HI>moderate</HI> meanes we can for the conti|nuanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a <HI>free trade</HI> and faire <HI>corre&s;pondancy</HI> with our native countrey; &s;o on the other &s;ide we will not &s;o much degenerate from the ancient candour of true <HI>Englishmen</HI> as to pro&s;titute tho&s;e <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Fredomes</HI> (to which we were borne) to the will and plea&s;ure of any: Neither do we thinke our <HI>numbers</HI> &s;o <HI>contemptible</HI> or our <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> &s;o <HI>weake</HI> as either to be <HI>forced</HI> or <HI>per|&s;uaded</HI> to &s;o vile a <HI>&s;ubmi&s;sion.</HI></P>
<P>And we can not imagine that there is &s;o meane &amp; ba&s;e minded a fellow among&s;t us, that will not perferre an honorable <HI>Death,</HI> before a <HI>Tedious</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;lavish life:</HI></P>
