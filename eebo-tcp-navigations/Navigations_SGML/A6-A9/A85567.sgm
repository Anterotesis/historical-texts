<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON Sunday Morning la&s;t, being the 15 of this pre&s;ent <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> &s;et &s;aile to Sea.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday being Monday the 16 of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> he di&s;covered the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and about one of the clock that day he met with a fleet of theirs, con&s;i&s;ting of 60 &s;aile of men of war, and 25 Merchants men.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cues</HI> fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 41 with
<PB N="2" REF="3">which he charged the Hollanders whole fleet and made a &s;tout fight.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Geor. Ay&s;cue</HI> charged them quite through, And not being able to go to the windward of all, received 40 broad &s;ides, and after goe away. Then Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> charged them againe, and made another furious a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that we have &s;unke their Rear Admirall; they (if not) will have much adoe to &s;ave her.</P>
<P>The fight was extream hot, but no board|ing either of other. We &s;uppo&s;e the Hollan|ders lo&s;s mu&s;t needs be very great, for they were extreamly torne with our bullets, and we have great lo&s;&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>Capt Li&s;le, a precious &s;weet commander, is &s;ore wounded and almo&s;t dead. Cap Pack that excellent &s;tout Sea-man, hath his leg &s;hot off. Night approaching the fight cea&s;ed, and in the night both the fleets lay &s;till, ha|ving both of them their lights out.</P>
<P>On this morning being the 17 in&s;tant, we di&s;covered the Enemy about 4 leagues off.</P>
<P>Hereupon a Councell of War was to con|&s;ult what to doe, in further proceedings a|gain&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="3">the enemy, and it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved by the Councel of war to ingage them againe. Hereupon preparation was made, our fleet pre&s;ently &s;ailed, and &s;tood up towards them.</P>
<P>About 12 a clock this pre&s;ent Tue&s;day, 17 Augu&s;t it is beleeved there might be an ingagement.</P>
<P>The Lord direct them and &s;tand by them, to deliver and &s;upport our friends, and I doubt not but the Lord will perfect that work he hath thus far hitherto triumphant|ly carried on.</P>
<P>Our men called upon God before they ingaged, the Dutch drunk &s;oundly to make them fight, &s;trong drink was given to their men as their cu&s;tome is, to rai&s;e up a courage in them to fight the mo&s;t de&s;perately.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t India Fleete with tho&s;e other &s;hips &s;tay until the&s;e combu&s;tions be a little over, or that they can have a &s;ure convoy, for without doubt the mouthes of the Dutch water at them. I beleeve by the next you will heare of a greater ingagement then this.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPon di&s;covery of the Dutch Fleet ye&s;terday about one a clocke, a Councell of War was pre&s;ently called, and it was re&s;olved to fight them pre&s;ently if they would stand, and accordingly, Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> &s;ailed and put up towards them.</P>
<P>About <HI>4</HI> a clock la&s;t night, Sir <HI>George Ay&s;|cue</HI> came up clo&s;e to them and engaged, and the fight was very hot. Our men fought all stoutly, as ever was knowne, we had lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome precious men, but without doubt the Dutch &s;ustained a ve|ry con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;e. The fight continued about <HI>4</HI> houres, &s;o that about <HI>8</HI> a clock it growing dark, they were forced to leave off.</P>
<P>The <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> being much &s;hattered, and ready to &s;inke came in hither, and are mending.</P>
<P>Cap. <HI>Packs</HI> Legge is &s;hot off in the fight, and Cap. <HI>Li&s;le</HI> hath a wound in his &s;houlder, that wee fear will prove mortall.</P>
<P>The Admirall and the re&s;t fought with great valour and gallantry, but wee have &s;u&s;tained lo&s;s,
<PB N="5" REF="4">though I beleeve not &s;o much as the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The Admirall lo&s;t in her <HI>12</HI> men in this fight and received <HI>60</HI> &s;hot in her Hull, And &s;o divers others have received lo&s;&s;e, and wee have many wounded men.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> kept as much as he could in ken of them all night, and is re&s;olved, if po&s;si|ble, to engage them this day.</P>
<P>And accordingly <HI>500</HI> men, big with courage and &s;toutne&s;&s;e, are gone in &s;mall &s;hips to recruit our fleet with men. And &s;o they are gone towards the Enemy.</P>
<P>It being now about noon is the time wee expect about which they may bee engaged.</P>
<P>The number of the Dutch that engaged ye&s;ter|day with Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI> were <HI>55</HI> men of Warre, we were but <HI>41.</HI></P>
<P>Our Admirall, Vice Admirall and Rear Admirall, with about five or &s;ix others, broke through their whole fleet, &s;o as the <HI>25</HI> Merchants men ran away to the coa&s;ts of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>What the event of this day will bee the Lord a|lone knows, but our tru&s;t is in the Lord of Hoa&s;ts, whom we hope is with us.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P> <HI>But the next opportunity, I &s;hal (which I beleeve will be within few houres) certifie you what I &s;hal further heare of the &s;ucce&s;&s;e or event.</HI></P>
