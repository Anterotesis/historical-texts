<HEAD>A WALK TO ISLINGTON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<L>IN Holiday-Time, when the Ladies of <HI>London</HI></L>
<L>Walk out with their Spouses, or think themselves Undone;</L>
<L>When Whores have a more than an ord'nary Itching</L>
<L>To visit the Fields, and so Ramble a Bitching;</L>
<L>When Vigorous Youth the young Damsel engages</L>
<L>In Meadowes, on Haycocks, or under the Hedges;</L>
<L>When Flesh and the Devil do greatly prevail,</L>
<L>And the Dame must have Prudence that governs her Tail;</L>
<L>When Honour in Wedlock by Lust is betray'd,</L>
<L>And the Maids are a gog to be otherways made:</L>
<L>Then I, like my Neighbours, to sweeten my Life,</L>
<L>Took a walk in the Fields; but for want of a Wife,</L>
<L>Was forc'd to take up with a Lady of Pleasure,</L>
<L>Who I turn'd off at Will, and enjoy'd at my Leisure:</L>
<L>We saunter'd about near the <HI>New-River-Head,</HI></L>
<L>Where we pratled and tatled, tho' what 'twas we said,</L>
<L>If you'd have me Discover, indeed I must fail-you,</L>
<L>Because 'twas on Business improper to tell-you.</L>
<L>I found by her Words I her heart could command,</L>
<L>So quickly we setled the matter in hand.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">We rambled about, till we came to a Gate,</L>
<L>Where abundance of Rabble peep'd in at a Grate,</L>
<L>To Gaze at the Ladies amidst of their Revels,</L>
<L>As fine all as <HI>Angels,</HI> but wicked as <HI>Devils.</HI></L>
<L>My Mistress, I found, had a huge inclination</L>
<L>That we should add Two to the Lewd Congregation:</L>
<L>I willing to yeild (for prevention of Strife)</L>
<L>To my Mate, as a Married Man would to his Wife,</L>
<L>She telling me Threepence a piece was the Price,</L>
<L>I once let her make me a Cull for a Sice.</L>
<L>Being pleas'd that I seem'd of so good a Condition,</L>
<L>She call'd me her <HI>Dear,</HI> to reward my submission.</L>
<L>And when she had righted her Hoods and her Pinners,</L>
<L>We entred the Walks to the rest of the Sinners:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Lime-Trees</HI> were plac'd at a Regular distance,</L>
<L>And <HI>Scrapers</HI> were giving their wofull assistance;</L>
<L>Where <HI>Bawds</HI> with their <HI>Iilts,</HI> and good <HI>Wives</HI> with their <HI>Daughters,</HI></L>
<L>Were met to <HI>Intreigue</HI> and to Tipple the <HI>Waters</HI>:</L>
<L>Some Drinking, some P&mdash;sing, some sitting, some walking,</L>
<L>And <HI>Beaus</HI> with their <HI>Belfa's</HI> were Cringing and Talking.</L>
<L>Some Citizens too, one might easily know</L>
<L>By his formally handing his <HI>Whither d'ye go</HI>;</L>
<L>For in the old order you're certain to find 'em,</L>
<L>Advance with their Tallow fac'd Daughters behind-'em;</L>
<L>For whether to <HI>Church,</HI> or to <HI>Bawdy-house</HI> bent,</L>
<L>It's always their Custom to put on the Saint:</L>
<L>And look so demure, one would think 'twas their Fashion</L>
<L>To say a long Grace, e'vn before Copulation.</L>
<L>'Twas pleasant to see how the sly Female Creatures</L>
<L>In Pomp led their Amorus Slaves in their Fetters:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="3">With side-looks endeavouring new Hearts to command,</L>
<L>Regardless of those they had got by the Hand;</L>
<L>Desirous of Trading with some <HI>Interloper,</HI></L>
<L>Disdaining old <HI>Plugtail,</HI> unfit for a Stopper.</L>
<L>The Wives of our Traders, those Jems of the City,</L>
<L>Who thus with their Leers and their Glances invite-ye,</L>
<L>From Court draw Examples of Leading their Lives,</L>
<L>And use their Fond Husbands, as Courtiers their Wives,</L>
<L>But Just for a Show; and with some hidden Treasure</L>
<L>Keep <HI>Gallanis,</HI> as th'other do <HI>Whores,</HI> for their Pleasure.</L>
<L>And that you may know such a good Wife as this,</L>
<L>From the Buxom <HI>Suburbian,</HI> or common <HI>Town-Miss,</HI></L>
<L>In Colours most proper her Picture I'll Paint,</L>
<L>And shew you a Devil dress'd up like a Saint.</L>
<L>She puts on a sanctifi'd Look for Disguise,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Sparrows</HI> and <HI>Goats</HI> may be seen in her Eyes:</L>
<L>But Ogle her well, you may read at first Sight,</L>
<L>How oft she desires to be Lov'd in a Night.</L>
<L>So formal her Mouth, that her Lips seem to Cry,</L>
<L>Come Kiss me, my Dear, or I Vow I shall Dye.</L>
<L>She Minces her Steps but to pleasure her Rider,</L>
<L>Her Pace she can alter, and lay her Legs wider.</L>
<L>Her Arms by her sides are so formally Posted,</L>
<L>She looks like a <HI>Pullet</HI> Truss'd up to be Roasted.</L>
<L>True Dancing-School-Breeding, in her is Recorded,</L>
<L>She shows all she Learn'd, when at <HI>Hackney</HI> she Boarded:</L>
<L>The Swell of her Bubbies, and Jut of her Bum,</L>
<L>To the next brawny Stallion, crys, <HI>Come, my Dear, Come</HI>:</L>
<L>The poor Fool, her Husband, she lugs by the Arm,</L>
<L>Who proud of his Rib, never thinks any harm:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">Whilst her Amorous Squints, full of Lustful Desire,</L>
<L>Proclaim him a Cuckold, to all that go by her.</L>
<L>Her Gown is of Sattin, and wants no Expence,</L>
<L>Such as worn at the Court about sev'n Years since.</L>
<L>Her Head-dress of Point, a Gold Watch by her Side,</L>
<L>Was giv'n her the day she was first made a Bride.</L>
<L>Her Petticoat loaded with Fring to the Top,</L>
<L>Notwithstanding its weight, will come easily up.</L>
<L>When ever she Talks, 'tis to rail against Evil;</L>
<L>And hates a Lewd Woman as bad as the Devil;</L>
<L>Because the Profession of Whore gives her Title,</L>
<L>To too much of what she herself has too little:</L>
<L>So pamper'd with Ease, and Luxurious Diet,</L>
<L>She never can keep her Concupiscence quiet:</L>
<L>These Dames were the Top of this Female Convention,</L>
<L>Who Trade for true Pleasure, and not for a Pension.</L>
<L>The next I observ'd, were a Number of Creatures</L>
<L>O'th' Feminine Gender, with very good Features;</L>
<L>Patch'd up with odd Remnants, from Brokers Collected,</L>
<L>From whence by us Judges, they might be suspected</L>
<L>To Labour beneath so unhappy a Fate,</L>
<L>As to pay by small Sums, what they wore by the Great.</L>
<L>Their Trains hung of different lengths from the Bum,</L>
<L>Which shew by their Size, how their Hearts are o'ercome,</L>
<L>By an answ'rable <HI>Penis,</HI> or suitable Sum.</L>
<L>As Rattle-Snakes, bred in the <HI>Indies,</HI> ne'er fail</L>
<L>To tell you their Age, by the Joynts in their Tail;</L>
<L>He's therefore mistaken, who treats 'em like Horses,</L>
<L>Instead of their Mouths, you must look at their Arses:</L>
<L>These all were so feeble, there's none could withstand</L>
<L>An agreeable Bribe in the Baum of her Hand,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4">Tho' stout as <HI>Minerva,</HI> I'd knock her flat down,</L>
<L>By the wonderful force that's contain'd in a Crown;</L>
<L>Perhaps she'd for half condescend to be Civil,</L>
<L>And Humble with Pains, both the Flesh and the Devil.</L>
<L>Another kind sort, with good honest-look'd Faces,</L>
<L>From the <HI>Hospital, Change,</HI> and from such sort of Places,</L>
<L>Were come with intent to be Kist by the by;</L>
<L>Who scorn to be Hired, yet scorn to Deny.</L>
<L>In kind melting words, let them know your desire,</L>
<L>And Swear you must do't, they'll not make you a Lyar;</L>
<L>But think themselves under a strict obligation,</L>
<L>To answer unbrib'd the sweet end of Creation.</L>
<L>The Sparks that attended to make up the show,</L>
<L>Were various; but first we'll begin with the <HI>Beau</HI>;</L>
<L>Whose Wig was so bushy, so Long, and so Fair,</L>
<L>The best part of Man, was quite cover'd with Hair;</L>
<L>That he look'd (as a body may modestly speak-it)</L>
<L>Like a <HI>Calf</HI> with bald Face, peeping out of a Thicket;</L>
<L>Or else like an <HI>Hedg-hog</HI> rowld up in his Bristles,</L>
<L>Hides all but his Nose in his Peruke of Thistles:</L>
<L>His Locks drudg his Coat, which such filthiness harbours,</L>
<L>Tho' made of Black-Cloth, 'tis as White as a Barber's.</L>
<L>His Sword, I may say, to my best of belief,</L>
<L>Was as long as a Spit for a Sir-Loin of Beef;</L>
<L>Being grac'd with a Ribbon of Scarlet or Blue,</L>
<L>That hung from the hilt, to the heel of his Shoe.</L>
<L>His gate is a Strut which he learns from the Stage,</L>
<L>When Heroes by Whores are put into a rage,</L>
<L>And vow in revenge how much Blood shall be spilt,</L>
<L>To punish the slights of some Tirmagant Jilt.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5">Thus proud, as a Turky-cock spreading his Plumes,</L>
<L>He stalks thro' the Walks, so enrich'd with Perfumes,</L>
<L>No Altar of Incense could with him Compare,</L>
<L>His Nostrils breath'd none but Orangery Air.</L>
<L>His Wig, and his Handkerchief, Gloves and Cravat,</L>
<L>Smelt sweet as the Arse of a <HI>Muscovie</HI>-Cat.</L>
<L>His Snush-Box each minute was open'd with Pains,</L>
<L>To fill his Head fuller of Snush than of Brains:</L>
<L>Thus Congies and Bows, with his Hat in his Hand,</L>
<L>And is each common <HI>Iilt</HI>'s Humble Slave to Command.</L>
<L>Abundance of these the Whores had at their Call,</L>
<L>But in showing you one, you've a sight of them all.</L>
<L>The Children of Fortune were next worth Observing,</L>
<L>By Stratagem kept, or from Hanging, or Starving:</L>
<L>Who bred to no Bus'ness, but train'd up in Evil,</L>
<L>Are Cunning in husling the Bones of the Devil;</L>
<L>Go on, and you here shall Impartially view,</L>
<L>In this little <HI>Speculum,</HI> one of the Crew.</L>
<L>His Leers are as Sharp as the Looks of a Hawk,</L>
<L>His Carriage Obliging, and Fawning his Talk:</L>
<L>In one Pocket Cards, and False Dice in the other,</L>
<L>To Cozen his Friend, or Impose on his Brother:</L>
<L>For this is a Maxim by Gamsters maintain'd,</L>
<L>At Play there is neither Relation or Friend.</L>
<L>When th' Box at the Table has once a beginning,</L>
<L>He thinks upon nothing but cheating and winning.</L>
<L>He quickly is Broke, and Recruited as soon,</L>
<L>Having more Revolutions by half than the Moon.</L>
<L>What ever by Knavery he wins from a Cully,</L>
<L>At th' Royal-Oak-Lottery he loses thro' Folly.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="5">To day he is Rich, and on top of the House,</L>
<L>To morrow as Humble and Poor as a Mouse.</L>
<L>Thus Fortune, altho' she be Curs'd often for't,</L>
<L>But makes her poor Minions her Scoff and her Sport;</L>
<L>And deals by her Sons, like a Bitch of a Mother,</L>
<L>To snatch with one Hand what she gives with the other.</L>
<L>He's sometimes as Gay as a Stallion at Court,</L>
<L>Perhaps the next day has lost all to his Shirt:</L>
<L>Thus stript, having nothing of Worth to deposit,</L>
<L>He sneaks into Rags that lay by in his Closet</L>
<L>Thus wanders asham'd, till by Sharping and Tricking,</L>
<L>Or flinging Levant with the hazzard of Kicking;</L>
<L>Or else by th' assistance of some common Bitch,</L>
<L>H' has rais'd himself up to's Original Pitch:</L>
<L>Thus Sharking and Shifting, in Quarrels and Strife,</L>
<L>He spins out the Threads of a Troublesome Life;</L>
<L>Till by an old Pocky Consumption he's hurld,</L>
<L>As poorly out, as he came into th' World.</L>
<L>The Amorous Tribe that next hither Resorts,</L>
<L>Are the Fry of the Law, from the Three <HI>Inns of Courts</HI>;</L>
<L>Who usually want (you may read in each Face)</L>
<L>More Wit than Good Fortune, less Money than Grace.</L>
<L>His Parents great Hopes, yet the chief of their Trouble,</L>
<L>Composs'd of two Cocks-combs, the <HI>Beau</HI> and the <HI>Bubble</HI>:</L>
<L>Let loose to all Follies, by th' want of no Guilt,</L>
<L>Turns Cully to <HI>Royal-Oake, Sharper,</HI> and <HI>Iilt.</HI></L>
<L>No Money but what pays a <HI>Debt</HI> does he Grudge;</L>
<L>Thus scorns to be <HI>Iust,</HI> as he hopes to be <HI>Iudge.</HI></L>
<L>The next were a Crew of Extravagant Blades;</L>
<L>Tho' Born to Estates, yet are bred up to Trades:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="6">As Merchants Apprentices, Sons of the City,</L>
<L>Who think to be <HI>Lewd,</HI> is the way to be <HI>Witty</HI>:</L>
<L>Or finely to Dance, and to Sing a New Song,</L>
<L>Are th' only Two Graces to Man do belong.</L>
<L>Thus led by the fury of Youth, without thinking,</L>
<L>To Bawdy-house, Play-house, to Gaming and Drinking,</L>
<L>Disdaining good Counsel, Reproof or Command,</L>
<L>Till spent what was painfully got to their hand;</L>
<L>Then full of Repentance, Despair, and Vexation,</L>
<L>Are Sold, like bad Goods, to some Foreign Plantation.</L>
<L>By this time it happen'd, without Pill or Potion,</L>
<L>Or help of the Waters, my <HI>Breech</HI> had a motion;</L>
<L>Left Doxie alone, and the Place chanc'd to chuse,</L>
<L>Assign'd for the Laxative Ladies to use:</L>
<L>Not knowing my Error, I shut to the Door,</L>
<L>In order to do what I hinted before;</L>
<L>And who should come running immediately after,</L>
<L>But a pretty young Damsel to scatter her Water;</L>
<L>Who being in haste, had the scurvie mishap</L>
<L>To thrust open the door, and clap <HI>Arse</HI> in my Lap:</L>
<L>Ads-wounds, <HI>said I,</HI> Lady fair, as I'm a Christian,</L>
<L>I never deserv'd from your Sex to be Pist-on:</L>
<L>The Lady, surpriz'd at the voice of a Man,</L>
<L>Gave a skip like a <HI>Squiril,</HI> and out again ran.</L>
<L>A curse on the Hovel, if lighter 't had been,</L>
<L>Bless my Eyes! what a delicate sight had I seen?</L>
<L>Her Person denoted her of such a Genus,</L>
<L>I dare to engage she'd a Bum like a <HI>Venus</HI>:</L>
<L>So soft, that I thought, I for ever cou'd feed-on</L>
<L>Such forbidden Fruit, like an <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Eden.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="6">When Nature was Eas'd, I went back to the Garden,</L>
<L>And for my long stay, beg'd my Mistresses Pardon:</L>
<L>But Fir'd with the touch of this Sattin Bumfiddle,</L>
<L>The Dart of the God prick'd my Heart like a Needle.</L>
<L>I look'd all-around, having noted her Gown,</L>
<L>But alas! My dear Bird from the Grotto was flown.</L>
<L>I sigh'd when I found I'd no Cure for my Pain,</L>
<L>But to Kiss my old Mistress again and again;</L>
<L>It being well known, to an experienc'd Lover,</L>
<L>A Flame rais'd by One, may be quench'd by Another.</L>
<L>When pretty well Tired, with seeing each Novice</L>
<L>Bow down to his Idol, as if sh'was a Goddess;</L>
<L>We walk'd by an Out-house, we found had been made.</L>
<L>For Raffling, and Lott'ries, and such sort of Trade;</L>
<L>And casting an Eye into one of the Sheds,</L>
<L>Saw a parcel of Grave Paralitical Heads,</L>
<L>Sit sipping of Coffee, and poring on Paper,</L>
<L>And some Smoaking silently round a VVax Taper;</L>
<L>Whilst others at <HI>Gammon,</HI> grown Peevish with Age,</L>
<L>Were wrangling for Pen'worths of Tea made of Sage.</L>
<L>In a Hovel adjoyning, a cunning sly Fox,</L>
<L>Stood shov'ling of Money down into a Box;</L>
<L>Who by an Old Project, was picking the Pockets</L>
<L>Of Fools in huge Wigs, and of Jilts in Gold Lockets;</L>
<L>Who're strangly bewitch'd to this National Evil,</L>
<L>Tho th' Odds that's against 'em would Cozen the Devil:</L>
<L>The Board ev'ry time, I observ'd, was a Winner;</L>
<L>Pox on 'em, <HI>says some,</HI> I have paid for my Dinner:</L>
<L>Whilst others in Passion rose up, that were broke,</L>
<L>And Curs'd the late Act that supprest not the Oak;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="7">Of which I've heard one thing that's worth Observation,</L>
<L>They've ruin'd most Families throughout the Nation,</L>
<L>Who rais'd their Estates by the Old Sequestration.</L>
<L>A Cunning Projector, stood musing hard by,</L>
<L>Who was formerly known to've a Finger i'th' Pye;</L>
<L>He lean'd on his Cudgel, and I being near,</L>
<L>He breath'd out these Words, which I chanc'd to o'er-hear,</L>
<L>A New Royal-Oak with two Balls, and the Cheat</L>
<L>Will be thought twice as Fair, yet be doubly as great.</L>
<L>And why with two Balls? Cause it's very well known,</L>
<L>A Pair pleases Ladies, much better than One.</L>
<L>And having thus Spoke, in a Petulant mood,</L>
<L>He trudg'd on to <HI>Sadler</HI>'s as fast as he cou'd.</L>
<L>To gaze at the Lott'ry I stood by a while,</L>
<L>See the Gamsters all Frown, and the Lottery-man Smile;</L>
<L>Some Scratching their Ears, others Biting their Nailes,</L>
<L>Cause their Hands flung away, what was earn'd by their Tails;</L>
<L>Some Cursing of Fortune, and calling for Wine,</L>
<L>Their Stocks being lost, knowing nowhere to Dine,</L>
<L>Were begging the Board, with a sorrowful Heart,</L>
<L>To allow 'em a Coach, who deserv'd but a Cart.</L>
<L>Thus tired with standing, we Rambled from thence,</L>
<L>And left the poor Fools to be gull'd of their Pence.</L>
<L>The Jilts with their Cullies by this time were Prancing</L>
<L>Within a large Shed, built on purpose for Dancing;</L>
<L>Which stunk so of Sweat, Pocky Breaths, and Perfume,</L>
<L>That my Mistress and I, soon avoided the Room,</L>
<L>And left the Lewd Herd, to examine new Faces,</L>
<L>And practice their Buttock-ball, Capers and Graces,</L>
<L>At <HI>Bevridge</HI>'s Learnt, and at such sort of Places.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="7">Being Surfeited now with this dull Recreation,</L>
<L>Our Fancies inclin'd to some pretty Collation</L>
<L>Of Cheesecakes, and Custards, and Pidgeon-Pye-puff,</L>
<L>With Bottle-Ale, Cider, and such sort of stuff.</L>
<L>Thus being resolv'd, I consulted my Dear,</L>
<L>And ask'd if she knew any Place that was near,</L>
<L>Would yield us some Pastime, as well as Good-Chear.</L>
<L>Who after a little Debate, made a Bargain</L>
<L>To turn into <HI>Sadlers</HI> for sake of the Organ;</L>
<L>The kind part of Females being alwaies advancing</L>
<L>(For pleasure) the Int'rest of Musick and Dancing.</L>
<L>We enter'd the House, were conducted up Stairs,</L>
<L>Where Lovers o'er Cheescakes were Seated by Pairs.</L>
<L>The Organs and Fiddles were Scraping and Humming,</L>
<L>The Guess for more Ale on the Tables were Drumming,</L>
<L>And poor <HI>Tom,</HI> amaz'd, crying, <HI>Coming, Sir, Coming.</HI></L>
<L>The Faint-Hearted Youth, who was fearful to ask</L>
<L>His Lady the Question, had call'd for a Flask;</L>
<L>That by the kind Juice, with more Courage inspir'd,</L>
<L>He boldly might Beg what she fondly Desir'd.</L>
<L>Whilst others, ill-bred, lolling over their Mugs,</L>
<L>Were Laughing &amp; Toying with their <HI>Iones</HI> and their <HI>Iugs</HI>;</L>
<L>Disdain'd to be Slaves to Perfections, or Graces,</L>
<L>Sat puffing Tobacco in their Mistresse's Faces.</L>
<L>Some 'Prentices too, who had made a bold Venture,</L>
<L>And Trespass'd a little beyond their Indenture,</L>
<L>Were each of them Treating his Mistresse's Maid,</L>
<L>For letting him in, when his Master's a Bed.</L>
<L>They tippled like Fishes, and prattled like Parrots,</L>
<L>And Gobbled down Cakes, as a Sow would do Carrots:</L>
<L>My Love to you <HI>Thomas,</HI> I thank you, good <HI>Betty</HI>;</L>
<L>I must have a Kiss. But I Vow I won't let-ye.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="8">VVhy <HI>Roger</HI> Kist <HI>Nanney,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> Kist <HI>Ienny</HI>;</L>
<L>And I'll have one too: Poh, the Devil is in-ye:</L>
<L>You'll never have done till I give you a Schooling;</L>
<L>You've rumpled my Head, that you have, with your Fooling;</L>
<L>You think, I believe, that my things Cost no Money;</L>
<L>I wonder you'd do so, you great silly <HI>Tony.</HI></L>
<L>By this time the Drawer had brought us our VVine,</L>
<L>VVith Tarts, Cakes, and Custards, and all that was fine,</L>
<L>To which we sat down, and did Eat, Talk, and Tipple,</L>
<L>To solace our selves, like the rest of the People.</L>
<L>For want of a Third in our Mess, we were fain</L>
<L>To use <HI>Hertfordshire</HI> kindness, <HI>Here's to you again.</HI></L>
<L>And then, that my Lady might smile at the Jest,</L>
<L>I drank in a Bumper, a Health to the best</L>
<L>Of Women in <HI>Christendom</HI>; she condescended</L>
<L>To pledge me, believing 'twas her I intended.</L>
<L>Thus having Refreshed our selves after our Walk,</L>
<L>We look'd o'er the Gallerry like the rest of the Folk;</L>
<L>Without-side of which, the Spectators to please,</L>
<L>Were Gods Painted roving in Clouds and in Seas;</L>
<L>A <HI>Nymph</HI> in a Fright, running over the Water.</L>
<L>And <HI>Neptune</HI> to Kiss her was Riding Post after.</L>
<L>Another chaste Damsel turn'd into a Lawrel,</L>
<L>To hinder <HI>Apollo</HI> from handling her <HI>Squirrel.</HI></L>
<L>Of such sort of Stories the Pannels were full:</L>
<L><HI>Europa</HI> bestriding a God like a Bull;</L>
<L>From whence City Dames first were taught the ill uses</L>
<L>Of Riding and Ruling their Horn-Headed Spouses.</L>
<L>Our Eyes being glutted with this pretty Sight,</L>
<L>VVe began to look down, and examine the Pit,</L>
<L>VVhere Butchers and Bayliffs, and such sort of Fellows,</L>
<L>VVere mix'd with a Vermin train'd up to the Gallows.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="8">As Buttocks and Files, House-breakers and Padders,</L>
<L>VVith Prize-Fighters, Sweetners, and such sort of Traders;</L>
<L>Informers, Theef-Takers, Deer-Stealers, and Bullies,</L>
<L>Old Straw-hatted Whores with their Twelve-penny Cullies,</L>
<L>Some Dancing and Skiping, some Ranting and Tearing,</L>
<L>Some Drinking and Smoaking, some Lying and Swearing;</L>
<L>And some with the Tapsters, were got in a Fray,</L>
<L>VVho without paying Reck'ning were stealing away.</L>
<L>VVhich made Lady Squab, with her Moonifi'd Face,</L>
<L>By the side of the Organ, resume her old place;</L>
<L>VVith hands on her Belly, she open'd her Throat,</L>
<L>And silenc'd the Noise, with her Musical Note:</L>
<L>The Guests were all Hush, and Attention was given,</L>
<L>The listening Mob thought themselves in a Heaven;</L>
<L>If the Ravishing Song which she sung, you wou'd know,</L>
<L><HI>It was</HI> Rub, rub, rub; rub, rub, rub; in and out ho.</L>
<L>As soon as her sweet, modest, Ditty was done,</L>
<L>She withdrew from her VVicker, as Chaste as a Nun.</L>
<L>The Butchers so pleas'd with her warbling strains,</L>
<L>Both Knock'd her, and Clap'd her all round for her Pains.</L>
<L>Then up starts a Fiddler in Scarlet, so fierce,</L>
<L>So unlike an <HI>Orpheus,</HI> he look'd like a <HI>Mars.</HI></L>
<L>He runs up in Alt, with a Hey-Diddle-diddle,</L>
<L>To shew what a Fool he could make of a Fiddle;</L>
<L>And has such an excellent hand at a Pinch,</L>
<L>He hit's Half a Note, to a Quarter of an Inch.</L>
<L>Then in comes a Damsel drest up in her Tinsy,</L>
<L>Too Homely and Sluttish, to Tickle ones Fancy;</L>
<L>By her Impudence sure, tho' she's Ag'd but Eleven,</L>
<L>She knew how to Sin by the time she was Seven;</L>
<L>Arm'd <HI>Amazon</HI> like, with abundance of Rapiers,</L>
<L>VVhich she puts to her Throat, as she Dances and Capers.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="9">And further, the Mob's Admiration to kindle,</L>
<L>She turns on her Heel, like a VVheel on a Spindle;</L>
<L>And under her Petty-coats gathers such VVind,</L>
<L>That Fans her, and cools her, before and behind.</L>
<L>The next that appear'd, was a Young Babe of Grace,</L>
<L>VVith <HI>Merc'ry</HI> in's Heels, and a Gallows in's Face;</L>
<L>VVhose Sawcy Behaviour, and Impudent Air,</L>
<L>Denotes he was born for a <HI>Barthol'mew-Fair</HI>:</L>
<L>Begot in a Cellar, at Head of a But,</L>
<L>His Father a Tapster, his Mother a Slut;</L>
<L>And that the Good Liquor might o'er-him prevail,</L>
<L>No Pap did they give him, but Nurs'd him with Ale:</L>
<L>Thus wrap'd in Blew-Apron, instead of a Clout,</L>
<L>VVas Rock'd in a Tap-Tub, and Christ'ned in Stout;</L>
<L>VVhich makes the Child's Impudence greatly surmount</L>
<L>A Hundred bold Bastards, Baptis'd at the Font.</L>
<L>In Dancing a Jig, lies the chief of his Graces,</L>
<L>And making strange Musick-house Monkey-like Faces.</L>
<L>Then in a Clown's Dress comes my honest Friend <HI>Thomas,</HI></L>
<L>VVho looks by his Bulk to be Lord of the <HI>Domus</HI>;</L>
<L>He cocks up his Hat, draws his Heels to his Arse,</L>
<L>And makes his own Person as good as a Farce:</L>
<L>But since thou art Honest, and fills me good <HI>Nants,</HI></L>
<L>I'll let thee alone, and not spoil a good Dance.</L>
