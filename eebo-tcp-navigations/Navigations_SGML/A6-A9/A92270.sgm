<HEAD>REASONS Humbly Offer'd To the Honourable the Commons of <HI>England</HI> A&s;&s;em|bled in <HI>Parliament,</HI> &s;hewing the great Lo&s;s that Accrues to their Maje&s;ties in their Revenue, and their Subjects both at Home and in their Planta|tions Abroad, by the <HI>African</HI> Company's Ingro&s;&s;ing the Sole Trade of <HI>Africa,</HI> confining it to the Narrow Joynt Stock of little more than One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, excluding all other their Maje&s;ty's Subjects both at Home and Abroad, to their Great Detriment and Threatned Ruine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. FIr&s;t, their Maje&s;ty's I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> being very large, and not a Twentieth Part Planted, requires a greater Supply of Negroes, than the <HI>African</HI> Com|pany have furni&s;hed them with, and for tho&s;e they bring they exact exor|bitant and intollerable Rates, which tends to the Ruine of the Inhabitants and Planters of the &s;aid I&s;land.</P>
<P N="2">II. It was once agreed before the King and Council, towards the latter end of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, That the Company &s;hould furni&s;h the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> with Three Thou&s;and Negroes <HI>per Annum</HI> at 17 <HI>l.</HI> 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Head; which, as we are informed, was in pur&s;uance to what they were oblig'd upon obtaining their Char|ter, though particular Merchants offer'd at the &s;ame time to do it for 14 <HI>l.</HI>; but the King being de&s;irous to plea&s;e the Company, obliged the People to agree with the &s;aid Company at 17 <HI>l.</HI> 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d;</HI> though pre&s;ently after, and ever &s;ince they were abu&s;ed in Both; for they had not from the Company the Quantities promi|&s;ed, and the Company exacted what Rates they plea&s;ed, even to 22 <HI>l;</HI> and &s;ince to greater Prices; and they have 10 <HI>per Cent per Annum</HI> Intere&s;t after &s;ix Months, for all that do not pay in their time.</P>
<P N="3">III. Hereby the Increa&s;e of Their Maje&s;ties Revenue is extraordinarily ob&s;tructed, &s;ince if the Planters were &s;upply'd with Negroes &s;uitable to their occa&s;ions, whereas they now produce one Tun of <HI>Sugar,</HI> they would make four Tuns; and <HI>Indigo, Cotton Wool, Ginger,</HI> &amp;c. in proportion, and each Tunn or four Hog&s;heads of <HI>Sugar,</HI> pays Their Maje&s;ties for Duty 6 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Sugar, Indigo, Cotton-Wool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being produced by the &s;trength of Negroes, if the I&s;land be &s;lenderly &s;upplied, or at dear Rates (which mu&s;t be expected when none &s;ells but the Company) then will the &s;aid Comodities co&s;t &s;o dear that <HI>England</HI> cannot hold the Market with the <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Other Foreign Nations may Trade freely on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At times the Company have had fourteen of the King's Men of War crui&s;ing on the Coast of</HI> Africa, <HI>and off the I&s;lands, to take all</HI> Eng|li&s;h <HI>Merchant-Men who had not their Per|mi&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Brandenburg|hers, Danes, French, Portugue&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. but if <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Men (not of the Company) be there getting Negroes or Gold in Exchange for our Woollen Manufactures, the Com|pany have heretofore procured Men of War, and have given Commi&s;&s;ions to their own Ships to Seize upon, bring into Port, Condemn and Sell their Ships and Goods to the Company's U&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Since the Trade of <HI>Africa</HI> hath been manag'd by this Company, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NB. <HI>Eeach</HI> 4th <HI>Rate co&s;ts lit|tle le&s;s than a</HI> 1000 l. <HI>a Month.</HI></NOTE> and confin'd to the narrow Joint-Stock of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> there is but one Buyer of &s;uch of our Woollen Manu|factures of Says, Perpetuanoes, Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as are exported to tho&s;e va&s;t Countries, to the great damage of the Makers thereof in particular, and of the Nation in general.
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">They buying &s;uch Goods as are proper for that part of the World, almo&s;t at their own Prices, and no greater Quantities than they can vend at exce&s;&s;ive Rates; whereas, were the Trade Free, their would be a great number of Buyers, the Goods would &s;ell dearer at home, and greater Quantities exported and vended abroad: So that by the limiting that Trade Their Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms are dimini&s;h'd, our Woollen Manufactures di&s;cou|rag'd, the Exportation thereof much le&s;&s;ened, and many Families who &s;ub&s;i&s;t thereby, reduced to Extremity and Want.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It may be con&s;idered, whereas the Planters of <HI>Jamaica</HI> have laid out Twenty times more than the &s;aid Company's Stock in Setling the &s;aid I&s;land, and that it is by their Indu&s;try, Labour, and Pains brought to what it now is, and that it hath been and will be Kept, Maintained, and Defended again&s;t all their Maje&s;ty's Ene|mies by their Maje&s;ty's Subjects there, and not by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>African</HI> Com|pany. It may be al&s;o con&s;idered, That the &s;aid Company neither by their Va|lour, Council, nor E&s;tates, have added any thing to the Increa&s;e, Support, and Maintenance of any of their Maje&s;ty's Dominions. How Grievous then it mu&s;t be, that this Company would force their Fellow-Subjects to give them 30, 35, and 40 <HI>per Cent</HI> upon their whole Cargo, only for their Permi&s;&s;ion to Buy Negroes in <HI>A|frica,</HI> for their own U&s;e, though their Ships &s;o Trading perhaps do not come with|in &s;everal Hundred Leagues of any of the Company's Factories; which Dear-Bought-Permi&s;&s;ions have been but lately obtain'd, and that with Difficulty; and yet this Company mu&s;t have &s;o much, or el&s;e it hath hitherto been the Cu&s;tom of the &s;aid Company to Seize the &s;aid Ships as afore&s;aid, to the Ruine of abundance of Families.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. And the more effectually to Oppre&s;s their MAJESTY's Subjects here, who do Make and Sell the Woollen Manufactures proper for that Trade, as Per|petuanoes, Sayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Company doth oblige tho&s;e who do give them 30 and 40 <HI>per Cent</HI> for their Liberty of Trade, to take their Cargoes from the &s;aid Company, &s;o that &s;till there is but One Buyer, by which means the Woollen Ma|nufactures are le&s;&s;ened in their Value.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The Abu&s;e put upon Ma&s;ters, Owners of Ships, and Seamen, are innumerable, for they having &s;o great a Part of the World &s;har'd out to them&s;elves by their Patent, a great many Ships, though never &s;o unwillingly, mu&s;t enter their Service, or Rot in the Harbours; and if they or their Seamen do carry any &s;mall Adventure, at their Return they are certainly Ruin'd; fir&s;t tying them up to intollerable Conditi|ons by their Charter-Party, and then &s;top all their Fraight; and have always a &s;tand|ing Committee to manage their Law-Suits, and their whole Stock to Wage War a|gain&s;t the Poor Ma&s;ter, who if he will not be kept out of his Fraight four, five, or &s;ix Years, mu&s;t come in an Humble Manner to Submit to the Mercy of their Court, for &s;uch a Mulct as they &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;et upon him; which is gene|rally to lo&s;e the Value of his Goods, and over and above, to pay 100 <HI>l.</HI> or more, according to their own Will and Plea&s;ure; or if he will come to a Reference, he mu&s;t choo&s;e for his Arbitrators two of their own Committee, whereby they make them|&s;elves Judges in their own Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> If their Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the Sugar-Plantations, if tho&s;e here in <HI>Eng|land</HI> that do make and are concern'd in the Woollen Manufacture, if the Merchants, Owners of Ships, Ma&s;ters, and Seamen are &s;o U&s;ed by this Company when only Supported by a Patent, what Oppre&s;&s;ions may they not expect when they are Sup|ported by a Law?</P>
<P><HI>For Redre&s;s of the aforegoing Mi&s;chiefs, and Prevention thereof for the future, We Humbly Propo&s;e as an Expedient to this Honourable Hou&s;e, That the Trade of</HI> Africa <HI>may be left Open and Free, or under &s;uch a Regulation that any of their Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects may at any time be admitted to Trade in &s;ome &s;ort like the</HI> Turky <HI>Company, with their Stocks apart; &s;o will the Woollen Manufactures be advanced in their Price, and their Vent encrea&s;ed, Merchants, Planters, and Owners of Ships incouraged, and their Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms much Augmented.</HI></P>
