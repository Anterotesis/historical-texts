<P><HI>October</HI> 17. _ON this day about 10. of the clock the Lord Admirall with a number of Captains and Gentlemen landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> at who&s;e landing there was a great triumph in token of our love to his renowned actions, our Fleet of Ships being a|bout 32. di&s;charged three times on all &s;ides, &s;o that there were neere 200. Peeces of Ordnance di&s;char|ged at that time, with many expre&s;&s;ions of joy and hearty wi&s;hes for our Admirals good &s;ucce&s;&s;e upon the land; at who&s;e departure all Ma&s;ters and Mari|ners much lamented, though they had Malago Sack of the be&s;t to cheri&s;h their comfortle&s;&s;e hearts, that afterward there was health upon health drunk that day in abundance, as al&s;o to the Vice-Admirall Ca|ptaine <HI>Battie,</HI> who hath the whole charge of the Navy in the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> ab&s;ence.</P>

<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 21. We had a mu&s;ter, and rode &s;till in the <HI>Downes,</HI> the Whelps being imployed unto <HI>Holland,</HI> and weighed anchor with a We&s;terly wind; about 5. of the clock in the evening the Antilope came in|to our Fleet, who had been at the <HI>Brill,</HI> and bronght us newes that there were 17. &s;aile of Flemmi&s;h Hoyes as then going to the <HI>Brill</HI> with French &s;oul|diers: another &s;hip being full of French Comman|ders, would not &s;trike &s;aile unto His Maje&s;ties &s;hips, upon which Captaine <HI>Fox</HI> di&s;charged two or three peeces of Ordnance upon them, and then, and not before, he &s;truck the top-&s;aile down upon the cape.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P> <HI>Octob.</HI> 22. We lay &s;till at anchor, and the Vice-Ad|mirall going a&s;hore was again welcomed as before.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 23. We were divided into Squadrons of 3. and to each Squadron were annexed 5. Merchants &s;hips, and &s;o by con&s;ent were di&s;per&s;t about &s;everall places.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 24. The Leopard and the Sam&s;on with two Whelpes weighed anchor very early in the morn|ing, and coa&s;ted about <HI>Callis</HI> Road, and came in to the re&s;t of the Fleet on the <HI>Downes</HI> that evening.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 25. The Lyon, the Freeman, with two Whelps, weighed anchor and left the Fleet, the Whelps came in the next day about noone, and the other two about night; at who&s;e returne wee had newes of a fight betwixt a Hollander and 2. Dun|kerks Slopes on our &s;eas neer <HI>Dover</HI> road, the Hol|lander, having 10. peeces of ordnance, was taken by the Slopes, his men all hurt but 4. and the Gunner kild; but an Engli&s;h &s;hip, called the Ble&s;&s;ing, re&s;cued him, and gave the Hollander his &s;hip againe.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 26. About twelve of the clock we met the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Man of Warre, cha&s;ing of a Merchants &s;hip of <HI>London,</HI> which came from the Ea&s;t Indies, but &s;he was con&s;trained to put in for <HI>Ireland,</HI> where this Man of War had fetcht her out: he &s;aluted our Vice-Admirall with many pee|ces of ordnance, which were an&s;wered againe with the like: at the la&s;t we boarded her, and took ther|in armour for 5000. men going to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which we made &s;tay of, and intend to &s;end her with a &s;afe convoy to <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 30. The wind being calm at W. and by S. we weighed anchor, and &s;ailed to and fro, praying for a faire gale of wind to cour&s;e the &s;ea; for our Vice-Admirall had notice given him of 14. Flemins and 14. French which kept nigh <HI>Portland,</HI> but &s;ince we heard they were parted, neverthele&s;&s;e we di&s;|charged a peece of ordnance, and put out a red flag in the Me&s;on &s;hroud: immediately the Captaines and Ma&s;ters of every &s;hip made their repair aboard, where we called a Councell of Warre, in which it was ordered, that if in ca&s;e we met with the Hol|landers and French Fleet together, and that the French would not do their obey&s;ance, to &s;end to the Hollanders to tell them, we did not think they would any wayes come again&s;t the King and Par|liament, &s;o according to their an&s;wers to deale with them, who &s;ent us a faire an&s;wer, that they never had any intent to come again&s;t the King or Parlia|ment, the King being their only Protector.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 1. We came to <HI>Danna&s;e,</HI> which is the Ea|&s;terly part of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> and about 11. a clock we came to anchor 2. or 3. leagues from the I&s;le, where we lay till 4. of the clock the next morning.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 2. We came to <HI>S. Ellen</HI> near the <HI>I&s;te of Wight,</HI> where we rode untill the 5. of this moneth, and weighing anchor we de&s;cried 40. and odd &s;aile, whom we thought to be the Dutch and French Fleet; but when we came up to them, we found them to be Flemmi&s;h Merchants which came out of <HI>France</HI> with &s;alt, except &s;ome 3. or 4. men of warre:
<PB N="5" REF="4">we &s;pake with &s;ome of them, and after &s;ome &s;mall view of them, we parted.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 5. We came into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, all the way not pa&s;t any thing of note, &s;ave that we &s;eized on two Dunkerks laden with Ammunition for <HI>Ire|land:</HI> but &s;ince our coming here, and before, we heard that the Flemins have &s;worn never to lift up their hands again&s;t the King or Parliament of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and that they are not in company with the French, who have been about our coa&s;ts, but are now gone; we onely &s;tay for a faire wind to carie us to the Lands end, and as farre as <HI>Silly,</HI> and &s;o I think we &s;hall return hither againe, whence what may pa&s;&s;e hereafter of more con&s;equence I &s;hall be glad to advi&s;e you, and &s;hould joy to &s;ee &s;ome &s;port if any dur&s;t meet us; but I feare that labour will be &s;aved; but we &s;hall not re&s;t till we have met with the King of <HI>France</HI> his Army, which is about 10000 &s;ouldiers, but we &s;hall narrowly watch their land|ing upon any of onr coa&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 6. We weighed anchor out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, and came neare the <HI>I&s;le of Silly,</HI> and on the &s;ame day we came into the Sound again, where we found one of the King of <HI>France</HI> his Dragons, be|ing &s;uch a &s;hip as one of His Maje&s;ties Whelps, ha|ving with her two &s;mall Barks, the one he had re|lieved out of the hands of Dunkerks; the Captaine of the &s;hip went aboard our Admirall, but &s;tayed not long, but was di&s;charged, he told our Vice-Ad|mirall that 12. &s;aile of Dutch, and 14. &s;ail of French which lay about our coa&s;t, waiting for purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 7. We coa&s;ted up and down, and within &s;hot of <HI>Poole</HI> there were three French Barks laid at
<PB N="6" REF="5">anchor driven in through tempe&s;tuous weather, our &s;hips were too great a burden to follow them, but we &s;ent our &s;hallops well man'd to board them, and there was found therein 1000. mens armour, going for <HI>Ireland,</HI> all which we &s;eized on, and have &s;tayed the Barks till further order of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. Within 3. leagues of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> we &s;ei|zed on a Flemi&s;h &s;hip who had landed divers com|manders, as by the examination of the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip it appeared, that they were &s;ent into <HI>Cornwall</HI> with Letters from Colonell <HI>Goring</HI> to Sir <HI>Ralph Ho|pton,</HI> the &s;hip wee gave in charge to the Maior of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> the Captain and &s;oldiers &s;ent to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Novem.</HI> 9, 10. We &s;pied a Fleet of Dunkerks com|ing from the Southward, &s;u&s;pecting Colonel <HI>Goring</HI> and others to be therein, but the &s;wiftne&s;&s;e of their &s;mall ve&s;&s;els out-&s;ailed our Fleet.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 11. We took the Dutch man of war that landed Prince <HI>Robert</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who was laden with &s;tore of ammunition, and going for <HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> we have di&s;trained both &s;hip and ammu|nition till the Prince &s;hall reprieve them.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 12. Wee had order to come for <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> and what further order as yet I know not, but we hope we &s;hall make a good voyage, and take all the &s;couts roving up and downe our coa&s;ts; for we have laid diligent wait in all creeks, to &s;top the pa&s;&s;age of the Cavaliers from coming out or going in, in the <HI>interim</HI> if any thing pa&s;&s;e, you &s;hall heare from me, but believe no report contrary to this journall, which is the truth of our proceedings.</P>
