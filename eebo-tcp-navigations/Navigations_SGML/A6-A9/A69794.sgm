<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING often Ob&s;erved, that Re|lations
of Travels, Voyages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are generally very Acceptable to the
Genius of the Engli&s;h Nation, I
judged that it might not be altogether Imperti|nent
to give a brief Account of &s;ome remarkable
Ob&s;ervations made during my Abode in Foreign
Countries, e&s;pecially having Travelled for the
&s;pace of Sixteen Years through <HI>Holland, Ger|many,
Sweden, Denmark,</HI> and other con&s;ide|rable
Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I ea&s;ily fore&s;ee, that it will be &s;oon Objected,
that after &s;o great a Man as Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI>
who hath already Publi&s;hed a full and incompara|ble
De&s;cription of the Policy and Government of
the States of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> it would
be a vain Pre&s;umption to attempt any farther on
that Subject. However, without derogating from
his Honour, I have here in&s;erted divers particular
Remarks, not mention'd by him, but &s;uch as Tra|vellers
may make U&s;e of to very good purpo&s;e,
for who&s;e Information this &s;mall E&s;&s;ay is chiefly
<PB REF="3">
de&s;ign'd. And it will be the more eminently
U&s;eful at this time, in re&s;pect of the great num|ber
of Engli&s;h Gentlemen, that now Travel that
way. Wherefore I doubt not, but this will be a
&s;ufficient Plea to cover me from the Imputation of
Vanity, and to make it appear, that what I have
here perform'd, is only intended for the publick
Service in general, and the particular A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;hall hereafter Travel
through the&s;e Countries. The Li&s;ts of the Pa&s;&s;age
Boats and Wagons in <HI>Holland,</HI> with the Hours of
their going off, which I have in&s;erted, the Tra|veller
will find extreamly U&s;eful.</P>
<P>As for the Relation of the Kings Voyage to
<HI>Holland,</HI> annexed at the end. I Confe&s;s indeed,
That it de&s;erves to be Written by an abler Hand;
but being at that time at the <HI>Hague,</HI> I was in|duced
by Curio&s;ity, to take an exact Account of
this &s;o extraordinary a Solemnity, which I did at
fir&s;t for my own private U&s;e, but have now Pub|li&s;hed
it through the importunity of &s;ome Friends.
The Pro&s;pects of the Triumphal Arches, Pyra|mids,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are exactly Copied from the Original
Draughts taken at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and are the true
Repre&s;entations of them.</P>

OF
HOLLAND:
With &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ary
DIRECTIONS
FOR
Such as intend to Travel through
the Province of HOLLAND,
GERMANY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS they that confine them&s;elves to
their own Country, have not the
opportunity to &s;ee and ob&s;erve
Rarities in other Parts of the
World; &s;o, &s;uch as go into Foreign Places,
rather Wander at Random, than Travel, who
have not the Curio&s;ity to commit to Me|mory
or Writing &s;uch Things they meet
with, both for their own and others Satisfa|ction,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
as may demon&s;trate the Fruits of their
Travels.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, all Travellers are not of alike
Temper; &s;ome delight them&s;elves in Con|templation
of the Curio&s;ities of Arts; &s;ome
are taken with the Varieties of the Works of
Nature; others &s;peculate, with a kind of Re|verence,
the Decays and Ruins of Antiquity;
others &s;tudiou&s;ly inform them&s;elves with the
Tran&s;actions of Modern Times; others with
the Government and Polity; others &s;peculate
the &s;trange Cu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Fa&s;hions of the Pla|ces
they pa&s;s through; to be &s;hort, every one
labours to entertain the Reader with tho&s;e
Objects and Rarities of Foreign Parts his Ge|nius
and Inclination is mo&s;t affected with.</P>
<P>As to my &s;elf, although during the &s;pace of
16 Years Travel, I might have enlarged, ac|cording
to the Curio&s;ity and Opportunity I
have had in the rehear&s;al of many rare and
exqui&s;ite Things very ob&s;ervable; yet my
chief Aim was, to make &s;uch Remarks as
might mo&s;t contribute to the common Good
of Human Society and Civil Life, in taking
notice of the Government and Polity of the
&s;everal States and Dominions where I have
been, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>United Provinces, Germany,
Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and other Countries, who&s;e
natural Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed to
me mo&s;t to &s;ympathize with our Engli&s;h
Nation, and thereby have an occa&s;ion to do
&s;ome good to my own Country. Expect
<PB N="3" REF="4">
not, Reader, a like punctualne&s;s, as to all the
forementioned places, becau&s;e very many
things, which I might have ob&s;erved, are
much agreeing, and &s;o may be referred to
what &s;hall be &s;poken of the Polity and Go|vernment
of <HI>Holland,</HI> which, for Rea&s;ons I
&s;hall by and by hint at, is the chief End I
aimed at in this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>We will begin then in the fir&s;t place with
the Commonwealth of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Domi|nions
of the States General, which th&ocirc; for
&s;ome years were in a declining condition, and
their Forces exceedingly weakened, by rea|&s;on
of that fatal War it managed again&s;t <HI>Eng|land,
France,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> unto
which, if we add the inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions of
tho&s;e two Factions, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and
<HI>Love&s;tein,</HI> that Politick Body, was &s;o totter'd
and torn, as did threaten its utter and total
Ruine.</P>
<P>But as Bodies, whether Natural or Politick,
after that a violent Fit hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ore &s;haken, di&s;&s;i|pated,
and exhau&s;ted their Spirits, may reco|ver
vigor, and look lively again, if &s;o be the
Radical Con&s;titution and Natural Temper
be not wholly changed and depraved; even
&s;o this Commonwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> hath vi&s;ibly
recovered Strength again, and attained its
former Force and Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>We will therefore make &s;ome Remarks,
as to the Defects and Failings (ob&s;erved not
only by me, but al&s;o by others) which that
<PB N="4" REF="5">
famous Commonwealth hath of late years
been guilty of; which I &s;hall do not out of
any Malice, or de&s;ign of Reflection, the in|tention
of writing this Treati&s;e being &s;imply
to in&s;ert tho&s;e Defaults which the wi&s;e&s;t of
Authors have always judged nece&s;&s;ary, not
only for the Reformation of this, but of all
States what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This Commonwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> hath wor|thily
been the Wonder of all <HI>Europe</HI> during
this la&s;t Age, and perhaps not to be parallell'd
in the Records of former Times; for if we
con&s;ider how many years it was a&s;&s;aulted by
the then mo&s;t Potent Prince of <HI>Europe,</HI> who
a&s;pired to no le&s;s than the Univer&s;al Empire;
and that how formidable &s;oever he were, yet
they not only maintained their Preten&s;ions,
but with uninterrupted Pro&s;perity and Suc|cefsfulne&s;s
adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ed their Trade, and &s;pread
their Conque&s;ts in all the four Parts of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, though mo&s;t famous and vi|ctorious,
yet could not, as is be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ieved, in &s;o
&s;hort a time do what by this Commonwealth
hath been effected. In <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> they
&s;oon forced the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> to
yield to them mo&s;t of their Trade and Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions:
And th&ocirc; <HI>England</HI> put in for a &s;hare,
yet they were a long while vigorou&s;ly op|po&s;ed
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to this hour have
enough to do to keep what they have got|ten;
&s;o that in le&s;s than 100 years this Com|monwealth
<PB N="5" REF="5">
by their Indu&s;try, and Art in
Trading, are become &s;o exce&s;&s;ive Rich and
Potent, that they began to In&s;ult, and would
needs be Arbitrators to their Neighbouring
Princes and States, and encroach upon their
Territories and Dominions.</P>
<P>This drew upon them that fatal War be|fore-mentioned,
by which they were &s;orely
weaken'd and brought &s;o low, that except
GOD by a more than ordinary Providence
had protected and appeared for them, they
had certainly been ruinated, and never able
to recover them&s;elves again; however, their
Pride hereby was much abated: And as
Luxury and La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s are the &s;ad Effects
of Pro&s;perity, as well as Pride; &s;o &s;uch Vices
in a Body Politick and Commonwealth as do
corrupt the Radical Humours, by abating the
Vigour of the Vital Parts, do in&s;en&s;ibly tend
to the Con&s;umption and Decay of the whole.</P>
<P>That this Commonwealth hath much re|covered
its Strength, may clearly appear, if
we con&s;ider what great Things they have ef|fected
&s;ince the little time they have enjoyed
Peace: They have in le&s;s than 7 Years built
about 40 gallant Ships of War; They have
laid out va&s;t Sums of Trea&s;ure in refortifying
<HI>Narden, Mae&s;tricht, Breda,</HI> the <HI>Grave,</HI> and many
other Places; They have paid va&s;t Sums of
Money to their Allies for their Auxiliary
Troops, as al&s;o 200000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling to the King
of <HI>England</HI> to Enjoy their Peace with him. And
<PB N="6" REF="6">
be&s;ides all this, their Encrea&s;e in Riches and
Power may be gue&s;&s;ed at, by the many &s;tately
Hou&s;es built within the&s;e 5 Years in <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,
Rotterdam,</HI> and other Places; to all which
we may add, to what exce&s;&s;ive height the
Actions of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company
are ri&s;en, and the Obligations from the States
are &s;o e&s;teemed as to Security, that they can
get as much Mony as they plea&s;e at 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Not to &s;peak of the exceeding Encrea&s;e of
their Subjects, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>French</HI> King's
Tyranny again&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prote&s;tants in
<HI>France, Al&s;ace,</HI> and other parts of his Con|que&s;ts;
neither will we &s;peak of other Signs
of the Encrea&s;e of this Commonwealth, as
not judging it convenient to commit them
to Paper, but will now proceed to &s;hew the
Method of Living and Travelling in the
Dominions and Places of the States, which,
if you do well con&s;ider, you may &s;ee how
happy and ea&s;y the Government of <HI>England</HI>
is, above that of other Nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briell</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> is the u&s;ual place where
the Pacquet and King's Plea&s;ure-boats bring
on &s;uch as come to &s;ee the United Provin|ces;
but of late <HI>Helvoet-Sluys</HI> is the place the
Pacquet comes to, as being the more conve|nient
Port: Here be &s;ure to furni&s;h your &s;elf
well with Money. From hence you take a
Boat to <HI>Mae&s;land-Sluys</HI> or <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> which,
if you go in Company with others, will only
co&s;t you 5 Stivers; but if you take one for
<PB N="7" REF="6">
your &s;elf, will co&s;t 25 Stivers for <HI>Mae&s;eland-Sluce,</HI>
and a Ducatoon to <HI>Rotterdam:</HI> The
fifth part of which goes to the States for a
Tax, they call <HI>Pa&s;&s;agie Gelt;</HI> and the other
four parts are for the Boat-Men or Schippers,
who al&s;o out of their Gains mu&s;t pay a Tax
to the States, &s;o that by Computation you
pay a fifth Penny to the States for your Tra|velling
either in Boats by Water, or in Wa|gons
by Land.</P>
<P>As you pa&s;s by <HI>Ma&s;eland-Sluce</HI> you will &s;ee
a very fair Fi&s;hing Village, to which belong
near Two hundred Herring Bu&s;&s;es, but if
you go by the way of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you Sail by
two old Towns, called <HI>Flardin</HI> and <HI>Schiedam:</HI>
Yet let me advi&s;e you before you depart from
the <HI>Briell,</HI> to take a &s;erious view of it, as be|ing
the City which in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time
was one of the Cautionary Towns Pawned
to <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Briell</HI> had a Voice among
the States, but by rea&s;on <HI>Rotterdam</HI> hath got
away their Trade, by which having lo&s;t its
former Lu&s;tre, is now become a Fi&s;hing Town
only.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam</HI> is the Second City for Trade in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and by &s;ome is called, <HI>Little London,</HI>
as having va&s;t Traffick with <HI>England,</HI> in&s;o|much,
that many of the Citizens Speak good
Engli&s;h. There are in this City two con&s;i|derable
Churches of Engli&s;h and Scotch:
And how great a Trade they drive with the
King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects is evident, for in
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the year 1674, at the opening of the Waters,
after a great Fro&s;t, there departed out of
<HI>Rotterdam</HI> 300. Sail of Engli&s;h, Scotch, and
Iri&s;h Ships at once with an Ea&s;terly Wind:
And if a Rea&s;on &s;hould be demanded, how
it comes to pa&s;s that &s;o many Engli&s;h Ships
&s;hould frequently come to that Haven, It is
ea&s;ily an&s;wered, becau&s;e they can ordinarily
Load and Unload, and make returns to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> before a Ship can get
clear from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and the <HI>Texel:</HI> And
therefore your Engli&s;h Merchants find it
Cheaper, and more Commodious for Trade,
that after their Goods are arrived at <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI>
to &s;end their Goods in Boats Landward
into <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>This City is Famous, as being the place
where great <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> was Born, who&s;e Statue
of Bra&s;s &s;tands erected in the Market-place:
And although the Buildings here are not &s;o
&s;uperb as tho&s;e of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Leyden,</HI> or
<HI>Haerlem,</HI> yet the places worth the &s;eeing, are,
fir&s;t, the great Church, where &s;everal Ad|mirals
lie &s;tately Entombed; here you &s;ee
their Admiralty, Ea&s;t-India, and Stadt-Hou&s;es,
together with that called, <HI>Het Gemeen Lands
Huis.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you may for five Stivers
have a Boat to bring you to <HI>Delft,</HI> but before
you come thither you pa&s;s through a fair
Village called <HI>Over&s;chie,</HI> where the French
and Engli&s;h Youths are trained up in Litte|rature,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
as to the Latin and Dutch Tongue,
Book-keeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From thence in the &s;ame
Boat you come to <HI>Delft</HI> which is Famous for
making of Porceline to that degree, that it
much re&s;embles the <HI>China,</HI> but only it is not
Tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>In <HI>Delft</HI> is the great Magazin of Arms for
the whole Province of <HI>Holland:</HI> Their
Churches are very large, in one of which
are Tombs of the Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> Admi|ral
<HI>Tromp,</HI> and General <HI>Morgans</HI> Lady, and
in the Cloi&s;ter over again&s;t the Church, you
have an In&s;cription in a Pillar of Bra&s;s, &s;hew|ing
after what manner <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t, that
Famous Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was &s;hot to Death
by a Mi&s;creant Je&s;uit, with his de&s;erved
Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Delft</HI> hath the third Voice in the States of
<HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ends its Deputies unto the Col|lege
of the States General, and to all other
Colleges of the Commonwealth. They
have al&s;o a Chamber in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany,
as &s;hall be more largely &s;poken to,
when we &s;hall come to Treat of the State
of the &s;aid Company.</P>
<P>From <HI>Delft</HI> you may by Boat be brought
to the <HI>Hague</HI> for two Stivers and an half;
which is accounted the faire&s;t Village in the
World, both for pompous Buildings, and
the largene&s;s thereof; here the Princes of
<HI>Orange</HI> hold their Re&s;idence, as al&s;o the States
General, and the Council of State; here you
<PB N="10" REF="8">
have the Courts of Ju&s;tice, Chancery, and
other Courts of Law. Here you &s;ee that
great Hall, in which many Hundreds of
Colours are hung up in Trophy, taken
from the Emperor, Spaniard, and other Po|tentates
with whom they have waged War.
Their Council Chambers are admired by all
that &s;ee them. Many fair Libraries they
have belonging to particular Men. The
Princes Palace is a mo&s;t &s;uperb Building,
and there are many co&s;tly Gardens adjoyn|ing
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> together with that to the
Princes Hou&s;e in the Wood, in which Hou&s;e
are in a large Hall the mo&s;t rare and co&s;tly
Pictures of <HI>Europe;</HI> there al&s;o are tho&s;e Mag|nificent
and Unparalell'd Gardens of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">eer
<HI>Bentham</HI> of <HI>Ame&s;land</HI> and others. I might
here &s;peak of the &s;plendor of His Maje&s;ties
Court in <HI>Holland,</HI> of his Noble Virtues and Va|lour,
of the mo&s;t Virtuous and Beautiful Prin|ce&s;s
his Royal Con&s;ort, but I dare not, lea&s;t
I &s;hould infinitely fall &s;hort of what ought to
be, and which others have already done be|fore
me: And therefore leaving the <HI>Hague,</HI>
I &s;hall only tell you that from thence you
may for &s;even Stivers have a Boat to bring
you to <HI>Leyden. Leyden</HI> is a fair and great
City, and the Univer&s;ity is very Famous,
there being continually in it 1000 Students
from all parts, as <HI>Hungary, Poland, Germany,</HI>
yea from the Ottomans Empire it &s;elf, who
pretend to be Grecians, be&s;ides the Engli&s;h,
<PB N="11" REF="8">
Scots, and Iri&s;h, who this year were num|bred
to be above 80.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Things here to be
&s;een, I &s;hall &s;ummarily &s;et down: As the place
called the <HI>Bergh,</HI> formerly a Ca&s;tle belong|ing
to the Prince of <HI>Liege</HI> in <HI>Flanders:</HI> The
Stadt-hou&s;e, the Univer&s;ity Schools, e&s;pecially
that of the Anatomy, which excels all the
Anatomy Schools in the World, a Book of
the Rarities whereof you may have for &s;ix
Stivers; their Phy&s;ick Garden, and the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
Clo&s;et are all Ravi&s;hing in rare Curi|o&s;ities.
But as to their Colleges, they are
but two, and very &s;mall, not to be compa|red
with the &s;malle&s;t Halls in <HI>Oxford,</HI> neither
have they any Endowments, their mainte|nance
being only from the Charitable Col|lections
of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Holland;</HI> neither
are any Students to remain longer there than
till they attain the Degree of Batchelors of
Art: One of the Curators being demanded
by me, Why &s;o Rich a Commonwealth as
<HI>Holland</HI> is, did not Build and Endow Col|leges
after the manner of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cam|bridge;</HI>
an&s;wered, They had not &s;o many
able and publick &s;pirited Men as are in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and to deal plainly with you, &s;aid he,
had we &s;uch Colleges, our Burgherma&s;ters and
Magi&s;trates would fill them with their own
and their Friends Sons, who by leading a
lazie and idle Life, would never become
capable to &s;erve the Commonwealth, and
<PB N="12" REF="9">
therefore he judged it much better to put
them to Pen&s;ion in Burghers-Hou&s;es, leaving
them to the care of the Profe&s;&s;ors, who are
very diligent in keeping the Students at their
Exerci&s;es, both at publick Lectures, and in
their private Hou&s;es al&s;o, where they cau&s;e
them punctually at their appointed Hours to
come to their Examinations and Lectures,
be&s;ides tho&s;e they have in publick. Their
Churches are rare, &s;o are their Walks round
the City, and the Fortifications very plea&s;ing
to behold. Here you have the River <HI>Rhine</HI>
running through the City, and falling into
it from <HI>Catwyck op Zee. Leyden</HI> is very Fa|mous
in Hi&s;tory for the long Siege it held
out again&s;t the Spaniard. From hence for
12 Stivers and an half you are brought to
<HI>Haerlem</HI> by Water, being 12 Engli&s;h Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Harlem</HI> is Famous, in that <HI>Co&s;tor</HI> one of
their Burghers, fir&s;t Invented the Art of <HI>Prin|ting.</HI>
This <HI>Co&s;tor</HI> being &s;u&s;pected to be a
Conjurer, was fain to flee from <HI>Haerlem</HI> to
<HI>Cologne</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and there perfected his
Invention, having in <HI>Haerlem</HI> only found out
the way of Printing on one &s;ide of the Paper.
The fir&s;t Book he ever Printed is kept in the
Stadt-hou&s;e, for tho&s;e that are curious to &s;ee
it. Here is one of the faire&s;t and large&s;t
Churches of the Seventeen Provinces, in the
Walls whereof there remain to this day &s;tick|ing,
Cannon Bullets, &s;hot by the Spaniards
during the Siege thereof. In this Church
<PB N="13" REF="9">
are three Organs, as al&s;o the model of the
three Ships that Sailed from <HI>Haerlem</HI> to <HI>Dami|ater,</HI>
&s;eizing the Ca&s;tle in which the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> was kept a Pri&s;oner, and brought
him away to <HI>Holland:</HI> In the Tower of this
Church hang two Silver Bells, which they
al&s;o brought from thence, and now Ring
them every Night at nine a Clock.</P>
<P><HI>Haerlem</HI> is Renowned for making the fine&s;t
Linnen Cloth, Tyffinies, Damasks, and
Silk Stuffs; al&s;o Ribands and Tapes: They
have Mills by which they can Weave 40 or
50 pieces at a time; they make the fine&s;t
white Thread and Tapes for Lace in the
whole World; their Bleacheries &s;urpa&s;s all
other what&s;oever, their Waters whitening
Cloth better than any in the Seventeen
Provinces: They have a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Grove
like a little Wood, divided into Walks, where
on Sundays and Holy-days the Citizens of
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and other places come to take
their plea&s;ure. <HI>Haerlem</HI> is the Second City
of <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ends in Deputies unto all the
Colleges of the Government. From hence
you have a pa&s;&s;age by Boat to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
for &s;ix Stivers, but when you are come half
way, you mu&s;t &s;tep out of one Boat to go
into another, where you &s;ee a &s;tately Palace,
where the Lords, called <HI>Dykgraves</HI> &s;it; every
one of the&s;e Lords hath his Apartment when
he comes for the Concerns of the Sea-dykes
and Banks: Here are al&s;o two large Sluces,
<PB N="14" REF="10">
having Gates to let in or out Water from the
<HI>Haerlemmer Meer.</HI> Near this place about
<HI>Anno</HI> 1672, a part of the Sea-Bank was bro|ken
by a &s;trong North-We&s;t Wind, drown|ing
all the Land betwixt <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and
<HI>Haerlem,</HI> which co&s;t an incredible va&s;t Sum
to have it repaired. They &s;unk in this
Breach 400 &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els fil'd with Earth and
Stones, for a Foundation to rebuild the Wall
upon, and by un&s;peakable Indu&s;try and
Charges at la&s;t repaired the Bank.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which
having been the place of my abode for &s;e|veral
years, I &s;hall give a more large and
punctual account thereof then I do of other
Places: It is e&s;teemed by Intelligent Men,
the Second City in the World for Trade,
and not inferiour to any in Wealth. Cer|tainly
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is one of the Beautifulle&s;t
Cities in the World, their Buildings are
large, their Streets for the mo&s;t part plea|&s;antly
Planted with Trees, and Paved &s;o
neatly, as is to be found no where el&s;e in any
Country, &s;ave in &s;ome of the Seventeen Pro|vinces.
And although, as I have already
&s;aid, <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> may ju&s;tly be taken for the
Second or Third City after <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI>
yet it hath neither Court nor Univer&s;ity as
they have. And now in treating of all the
Excellences and Virtues of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> I
&s;hall not hyperbolize or flatter; for before
I have done, you &s;hall &s;ee, I &s;hall al&s;o faith|fully
<PB N="15" REF="10">
declaim again&s;t the Evils, Mi&s;takes, and
Vices in it.</P>
<P><HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;tands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, encompa&s;&s;ed with a very &s;trong Wall
and Ba&s;tions mo&s;t plea&s;ant to behold, with
a very large Gracht or Ditch for the defence
of three parts of the City, the fourth being
&s;ecured by an Arm of the Sea called the
River <HI>Y,</HI> or (as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men corruptly
call it) the <HI>Ty.</HI> There are 13 Churches in
this City for tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion
(called <HI>Dutch Presbyterians)</HI> to meet and
wor&s;hip in, with two <HI>French,</HI> one <HI>High-Dutch,</HI>
and one <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> all Presbyterian Churches,
who only are allowed Bells, and who&s;e Mi|ni&s;ters
are maintained by the Magi&s;trate.
All the&s;e Churches or Congregations make
up only a third part of the Inhabitants of the
City. The <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who have 85 Hou&s;es or
Chapels to meet in for their Wor&s;hip, make
another third part, and have a long Square
of Hou&s;es for their Nuns to live in, who are
not &s;hut up in Cloi&s;ters, as in Papi&s;t Coun|tries
they are wont to do, but may go in and
out at their plea&s;ure, yea and Marry al&s;o, if
they grow weary of a Nunni&s;h Life. The&s;e
Churches of the Papi&s;ts have no Bells allow'd
them, being look'd upon as Conventicles, and
are many times &s;hut up, and again opened at
the <HI>Scout</HI>'s plea&s;ure. The other third part
of the City is made up by <HI>Jews, Lutherans,
Armenians, Browni&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Independants,
<PB N="16" REF="11">
Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and the <HI>Quakers:</HI> None of which,
as was al&s;o &s;aid of the Papi&s;ts, have Bells al|lowed
them, but are accounted Conventi|cles;
and all that Marry among&s;t them mu&s;t
fir&s;t be married by the Magi&s;trate, and then
(if they plea&s;e) among them&s;elves in their
own A&s;&s;emblies; neither are any of them
admitted unto any Office in the Govern|ment,
but &s;uch only as are of the Reformed
or Presbiterian Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Jews, who are very con&s;iderable in
the Trade of this City, have two Syna|gogues,
one whereof is the large&s;t in Chri|&s;tendom,
and as &s;ome &s;ay, in the World;
&s;ure I am, it far exceeds tho&s;e in <HI>Rome, Ve|nice,</HI>
and all other places where I have been.
Within the Court-yard where their Syna|gogue
&s;tands, they have &s;everal Rooms or
Schools, where their Children are taught
Hebrew, and very carefully (to the &s;hame of
Chri&s;tians negligence) brought up and in|&s;tructed
in the Jewi&s;h Principles.</P>
<P><HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> for the wi&s;e State&s;men it hath
produced, is &s;aid to be a &s;econd <HI>Athens;</HI>
others make it the Storehou&s;e or Magazine
of <HI>Europe,</HI> for that it hath &s;uch great &s;tore of
Corn, wherewith it furni&s;hes many other Na|tions.
And &s;econdly, for the exceeding great
Magazine of Spices, which in ancient times
the <HI>Venetians</HI> brought by Land, furni&s;hing all
Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> but now is done by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company, which not only &s;upplies
<PB N="17" REF="11">
<HI>Europe</HI> therewith, but many places in the
<HI>Indies</HI> al&s;o. Thirdly, It hath inconceivable
Store of all manner of Provi&s;ions for War,
in&s;omuch, that <HI>England</HI> and divers other
Nations &s;end to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to buy Arms,
Buff-Coats, Belts, Match, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yea, here
are &s;everal Shop-keepers who can deliver
Arms for four or five Thou&s;and Men, and
at a cheaper rate than can be got any where
el&s;e; and this they can do by rea&s;on of their
great Indu&s;try in the Ingro&s;&s;ing mo&s;t of the
Iron Works on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and other Rivers,
which run into <HI>Holland.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI>
hath more &s;tore of &s;awed and prepared
Timber for Shipping than can be found in
any one Nation in the World; and this is
the Rea&s;on why her Neighbor Town <HI>Sardam</HI>
is made capable of Building Ships 20 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> cheaper than they can do in <HI>England</HI>
or <HI>France:</HI> So that both <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
do many times buy them in <HI>Holland:</HI> As
lately the King of <HI>Spain</HI> bought Ten Capital
Ships of the two Brothers the <HI>Melts</HI> Mer|chants
in this City. Fifthly, <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is
the Staple where the Emperor &s;ells his Quick-&s;ilver,
not only to the Spaniard, to u&s;e in
his Mines in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but for the making
of <HI>Cinoprium</HI> or <HI>Vermillion,</HI> with which <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI>
furni&s;heth not only <HI>Europe,</HI> but ma|ny

<P>The Stadthou&s;e, or Guild-hall of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>

will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, I believe, if I enlarge
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> little in its De&s;cription. This Noble Town-Hou&s;e
then, is Built all of Free-Stone, ac|cording
to the Modern Architecture of the
Corinthian Order, Adorned with Statues in
Bra&s;s, and Carving in Marble by the be&s;t
Ma&s;ters of the Age. A Pro&s;pect whereof
&s;ee in the following Figure. It is 282 Foot
wide, 232 Foot deep, and 116 Foot high,
be&s;ides the Tower. The Foundation is laid
upon 13659 Piles of Wood driven into the
Ground; the fir&s;t Stone of it was laid <HI>Octo|ber</HI>
28. 1648. In the middle over the Cor|ni&s;h,
and ju&s;t before the Tower, is a very
hand&s;ome piece of Carving in Marble of 82
Foot long, and 18 Foot high, wherein the
City of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is repre&s;ented by a Wo|man,
<PB N="20" REF="14">
on who&s;e Right Hand &s;its the God
<HI>Neptune,</HI> with his Trident, and two Sea-Godde&s;&s;es
bring her the Fruits of the Earth.
On her Left, two <HI>Na&iuml;des</HI> pre&s;ent her with
Laurels and Palms; and before her two Tri|tons
Dance and Sound their Horns. On the
top of this &s;tands an Image of Bra&s;s, repre|&s;enting
Peace, and one on each &s;ide repre|&s;enting
Providence and Ju&s;tice, each Figure
being 12 Foot high. And on the back part
of the Building to an&s;wer, is &s;uch another
piece of Carving, in Marble al&s;o, &s;hewing
the Grandeur and Commerce of the City;
in the middle &s;its a Woman, having on her
Head the Hat with Wings of <HI>Mercury;</HI> be|hind
her is &s;een the Ma&s;ts and Sails of a Ship,
and round about her lies all &s;orts of Mathe|matical
In&s;truments u&s;ed in Sailing; at her
Feet lie the two Rivers <HI>Y</HI> and <HI>Am&s;tel,</HI> and
on each &s;ide, the Inhabitants of the Four
Parts of the World bring her their Fruits.
Here likewi&s;e are placed three Images of
Bra&s;s of the &s;ame bigne&s;s with the other;
that on the top is an <HI>Atlas,</HI> bearing a very
large Globe of Copper, on the right Hand,
one repre&s;enting Temperance, and on the
left Ju&s;tice. On each of the four Corners of
the Building, over the Corni&s;h, &s;tand four
Eagles of Bra&s;s &s;upporting an Imperial Crown,
all finely Gilt. In the middle is erected a
very hand&s;om round Tower, advanced a|bout
50 Foot above the re&s;t of the Building,
<PB N="21" REF="14">
the Roof &s;upported by Pillars, and adorned
with Images; in it hang a very curious
Chime of Bells, which at certain times be|ing
played on by a Per&s;on maintained for
that purpo&s;e, afford a very agreeable Mu|&s;ick.
So much for the out &s;ide. And now
let us enter, which you may by Seven little
Arched Doors, which let you into the Porch,
from whence you enter the Hou&s;e by two
large Gates, between which opening by
Windows, (with Bars of Ca&s;t-Bra&s;s) to the
Street, &s;tands the Ju&s;tice-Hall for Trial of
Criminals, which is Adorned with many
curious Carvings in Marble of Ingenious De|vices,
which would be too long to de&s;cribe
particularly. Below Stairs, within &s;ide, is
kept the Office of the Bank, where the
Merchants write off their Money, the
Pri&s;ons both for Debtors and Criminals,
the Guard Chamber where the Citizens
keep the Head-Watch, and where the
Keys of the City Gates are kept lockt up in
a Che&s;t every Night, and &s;ome other Offices.
From hence you a&s;cend by a hand&s;ome
broad pair of Stairs, though not very light,
into the Burghers-Hall, which is 120 Foot
long, 57 Foot broad, and 98 Foot high,
in the Floor whereof are inlaid in Marble
the two Faces of the Terre&s;trial Globe, and
that of the Coele&s;tial, which ingeniou&s;ly

Countries of the Earth, and the Con&s;tella|tions

is 22 Foot Diameter. At the end of this

Tryed all Civil Cau&s;es between Man and
Man, and in the Galleries (which go round
two &s;quare Courts on each &s;ide the Hall, for
convenience of Light) are the &s;everal Cham|bers,

two or three more belonging to the &s;everal
Secretaries, all which are beautified with fine
Paintings, and ingenious Devices carved in
Marble over the Door of each Chamber; to
give a particular De&s;cription of which would
take up a Volume, which is not agreeable to
what I here pretend, the&s;e being only &s;hort
Remarks to put young Travallers in mind
of what is mo&s;t worthy their Ob&s;ervation.
I &s;hall only therefore &s;ay in general, that it
<PB N="23" REF="15">
is already a very noble, beautiful, and co&s;tly
Building, and is a &s;ufficient intimation of the
Richne&s;s of the City, but &s;hould they fini&s;h
it within &s;ide as they pretend, by Painting
the Ceilings, and Facing the Walls with
Marble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it would make it incompara|bly
the fine&s;t and co&s;tlie&s;t in the World.
Over the&s;e Chambers, in the &s;econd Story,
is kept a large Magazine of Arms, which
takes up one Angle of the Building, and is
very compleatly Furni&s;hed; the Arms are
all kept in Pre&s;&s;es &s;hut up, to avoid the in|jury
of the Weather; the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e
above is not u&s;ed, or Furni&s;hed at all. One
thing I mu&s;t not omit, and that is, That
there are Eight Ci&s;terns of Water kept always
full at the top of the Hou&s;e, which by Pipes
may be let down into every Room, to quench
any accidental Fire; and the Chimneys are
all lined with Copper, the former Stadthou&s;e
having been Burnt down by Accident.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed, and &s;peak of their
Alms-hou&s;es, and of the Government of the
Poor, of their Pri&s;ons, and Hou&s;es of Cor|rection.
This City is &s;aid to have 20000
Poor every day at Bed and Board. The
Alms-hou&s;es are many, and look more like
Princes Palaces than Lodgings for Poor Peo|ple:
Fir&s;t, there are Hou&s;es for Poor old
Men and Women, then a large &s;quare Pa|lace
for 300 Widows, then there are Ho&s;|pitals
for Boys and Girls, for Burghers Chil|dren,
<PB N="24" REF="16">
and for Strangers Children, or tho&s;e
called Foundlings; all the&s;e Boys and Girls
have every Sunday, and other days of Wor|&s;hip,
two Doites given them by the Fathers
of the&s;e Hou&s;es, the which the Children put
into the Deacons Bag when they gather for
the Poor in the Churches: Then there is an
Ho&s;pital for Fools, and a Bedlam: There
are Hou&s;es where common Beggers, and
Game&s;ters, and frequenters of Tap-hou&s;es
are kept hard at Work: There is al&s;o a Hou&s;e
called, the Ra&s;p-hou&s;e, where petty Thieves,
and &s;uch as fla&s;h one another with Knives,
&s;uch as beg with cheating Devices, Women
with fained great Bellies, Men pretending to
have been taken by the Turks, others that
pretend Wreck at Sea, and &s;uch as Beg with
a Clapper, or a Bell, as if they could not
Speak or Hear, &s;uch as the&s;e are kept hard
at Work, Ra&s;ping every day 50 pounds be|tween
two of them, or el&s;e are beaten with
a Bulls Pi&s;&s;el, and if yet they Rebel, and
wont Work, they are &s;et in a Tub, where
if they do not Pump, the Water will &s;well
over their Heads: Then there is a Hou&s;e
where Whores are kept to Work, as al&s;o
di&s;-Obedient Children, who live Idle, and
take no Cour&s;e to maintain them&s;elves; like|wi&s;e
Women commonly drinking them&s;elves
Drunk, and Scolds; all the&s;e &s;orts of Ho&s;pi|tals,
and Alms-hou&s;es are &s;tately Buildings,
richly Adorned with Pictures, and their
<PB N="25" REF="16">
Lodgings very neat and clean. In &s;ome, of
the Boys and Girls Ho&s;pitals there are 1500,
in &s;ome 800, and in &s;ome 500 in a Hou&s;e;
then they have Hou&s;es where a Man or a
Woman may have their Diet, Wa&s;hing, and
Lodging for his Life, giving a &s;mall Sum of
Money; the&s;e are called <HI>Brouders</HI> Hou&s;es.
The Alms Children of this City are held in
&s;uch Veneration and Re&s;pect, that a Man had
as good &s;trike a Burgherma&s;ters Child as one
of them. The&s;e Children are permitted to Tra|vel
in any of the Treck&s;cuts, or Pa&s;&s;age-Boats,
freely without Money: The&s;e Ho&s;pitals are
Governed by Men and Women, as are of an
un&s;potted Life, and reputed to be Rich, De|vout,
and Pious: It is very ob&s;ervable, that
the Women govern their Women Ho&s;pitals,
better than the Men do theirs; yea, it is a
general Ob&s;ervation in this Country, that
where the Women have the direction of the
Pur&s;e and Trade, the Husband &s;eldom prove
Bankrupts, it being the property of a true
Born Holland-Wife pre&s;ently after Marriage,
to apply her &s;elf wholly to her Bu&s;ine&s;s; but
I forbear to &s;ay any more of the Dutch-hou&s;ewives,
for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing our Engli&s;h

generally bred up to Indu&s;try; But to return
to the Acts of Charity of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the

Hou&s;e in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> hath a Box hanging in
a Chain, on which is Written, <HI>Think on the
Poor,</HI> &s;o that when any Merchant &s;ells Goods,
they commonly conclude no Bargain, but
more or le&s;s is put in the Poors Box; the&s;e
Boxes are lockt up by the Deacons, who
once a quarter go round the City, and take
the Money out of the Boxes. Then twice a
Week there are Men belonging to the Ho&s;|pitals
that go round the City, and ring a Bell
at every Hou&s;e, to know what the Ma&s;ter
or Mi&s;tri&s;s of the Hou&s;e will give to the
Box, who generally give not le&s;s than two
Stivers. Then every fir&s;t Wedne&s;day of the
Month, the Deacons in their turn, go round
the City, from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, to receive
what every Hou&s;e-keeper will give to the
Poor, then on the Week before the Sacra|ment
is given, a Mini&s;ter, with an Elder,
goes round the City to every Hou&s;e where
any Members of the Presbiterian Religion
live, and there ask if any differences be in
the Family, offering their Service to recon|cile
them; al&s;o to in&s;truct and prepare &s;uch
as are to receive the Sacrament: At this time
a Mini&s;ter may be &s;een to go into a Tap-hou&s;e
or Tavern, for which at another time
he would be counted a Wine-Bibber, and the
wor&s;t of Reprobates: At this time while
the&s;e Mini&s;ters and Elders go about the Ci|ty
on their Vi&s;itations, the People take an
occa&s;ion to give to the Poor. And here I
<PB N="27" REF="18">
ought not to omit telling you of their great
Charity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed French Prote&s;tants,
who are here in great Numbers. They main|tain
no le&s;s than 60 French Mini&s;ters, and
unto many Handicraft Trade&s;men, and
makers of Stuffs, and Cloth, they lend Sums
of Money, without Intere&s;t, to buy Work|ing
Tools, and Materials for their Work;
but this is no other then they formerly did to

leave to tell you, what King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
&s;aid of the Charity of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> when the
Duke of <HI>Lotherdal,</HI> hearing that the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI>'s Army was not able to oppo&s;e the
French from advancing &s;o near to <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>
the Duke jearingly &s;aid, <HI>That Oranges
would be very &s;carce in</HI> Holland, <HI>after</HI> Am&s;ter|dam
<HI>&s;hould fall into the French Hands to plunder.</HI>
To which His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, <HI>That he was of
Opinion, that God would pre&s;erve</HI> Am&s;terdam
<HI>from being de&s;troyed, if it were only for the great
Charity they have for the Poor,</HI> the which put
the Duke out of Countenance; I will &s;ay no
more of their Charity, only this, that they
leave no Stone unturned to bring Monies in|to
the Poors Stock; they make the Stage-players
pay 80000 Gilders a year to the Poor;
there is not a Rope-Dancer, Poppet-Player, or
any of that &s;ort of unnece&s;&s;ary Vermin which
<PB N="28" REF="19">
frequent Fairs, but pay the third Penny to
the Poor, which is carefully looked after, by
placing an Alms-man at the Door of the
Booths, to &s;ee that they cheat not the Poor
of their &s;hare. I &s;hall now in the next place
&s;ay &s;omething of the Clergy, I mean tho&s;e
called, <HI>The States Clergy,</HI> for the States are
ab&s;olutely Head of their Church; and when
any Synod of Divines meet, two of the States
are always pre&s;ent to hear that they debate
nothing relating, or reflecting on the Go|vernment,
or Governors; if they do, pre|&s;ently
the States cry, <HI>Ho la mij<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heeren Pre|dicanten,</HI>
and if their Mini&s;ters meddle with
any thing relating to the Government in
their Pulpits, they &s;end them a Brief, (which
&s;ome call a pair of Shooes) to quit the City,
and &s;ometimes Impri&s;on them to Boot; but
if they behave them&s;elves quietly and well,
as they ought to do, they then are re&s;pected
by the People as Gods upon Earth: They
have a Form of Prayer &s;ent them how they
&s;hall Pray for the States, and Stadholder,
nor mu&s;t they meddle with any other Reli|gion
in the Country, becau&s;e all &s;orts are
Tollerated, at lea&s;t Connived at by the Ma|gi&s;trates.
All tho&s;e called the Presbiterian
Mini&s;ters, or States Clergy, are obliged
under a Forfeiture to have done Preaching
and Praying by Eleven of the Clock in the
Forenoon on Sundays, becau&s;e then the
Scheepens go to the Stadthou&s;e, to Marry
<PB N="29" REF="19">
the Jews, Papi&s;ts, and Lutherans, and others
that may not marry after the Calvini&s;tical
Form; and the rea&s;on why the States thus
marry them fir&s;t according to Law, is to ren|der
their Children Legitimate, but they may
marry again afterwards as they plea&s;e them|&s;elves:
None may marry until they have
made their appearance at the Stadthou&s;e be|fore
the Lords; where, if the Parties be
agreed, the Preachers marry the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI>
and the Scheepens marry all the re&s;t, who dif|fer
from the Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law.</P>
<P>When one dies, the Friends dare not bu|ry
the Corps until it hath lain three days
open in the Coffin, that the Friends and Re|lations
of the decea&s;ed may be &s;atisfied that
the Party hath not been murdered, or re|ported
to be dead when alive; after three
days, the Corps mu&s;t be brought to the
Church before the Bell cea&s;eth tolling, which
is at two, for if you keep the Body untill half
three, then the Church Doors are lock'd,
and for the fir&s;t half hour mu&s;t be paid 25
Gilders, and for the &s;econd 50, and &s;o until
&s;ix, then they may amer&s;e you as much as
they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many rich people who make
that default on purpo&s;e, that they may have
&s;olemn occa&s;ion of giving to the Poor, as I
knew once an Engli&s;h Merchant did.</P>
<P>The next thing I &s;hall &s;peak of, is the me|thod
which the States ob&s;erve in ordering
<PB N="30" REF="20">
their Maritime Affairs, one of the greate&s;t
My&s;teries in their Government: The States
General divide their Admiralty into Five
Courts, which they call Chambers. The
Fir&s;t is <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> (which is the Chamber
call'd the <HI>Mae&s;e,)</HI> and hath the Admirals
Flag.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which hath the Vice-Admiral's
Flag; and <HI>Zealand</HI> hath the Rear-Admiral's
Flag; the other Two Chambers
are tho&s;e in <HI>North-Holland</HI> and <HI>Fric&s;land.</HI> Each
of the&s;e Five Chambers have their Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals, apart
from the States-Generals Flags; &s;o that when
the States have occa&s;ion to &s;et out a Fleet
of an Hundred Ships, more or le&s;s, every
Chamber knows the number they mu&s;t pro|vide
for their proportion, though in regard
of its Opulency, <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> frequently helps
her Neighbours, and adds two, or more, Ships
than their &s;hare comes to. The&s;e Cham|bers
have lately built 36 Men of War, and
now are building of 7 more; and all this is
done without noi&s;e, every one building their
proportion: And they have admirable me|thods
in pre&s;erving their Ships when built,
and their Magazines are in good order, eve|ry
Ship having an Apartment to lay up all
its Equipage in; and at the top of their Ma|gazines
are va&s;t Ci&s;terns, which are kept
con&s;tantly full of Water, having Pipes into
every Apartment to let it down upon any
<PB N="31" REF="20">
accident of Fire. And there is in their Ma|gazines
a Nur&s;ery Room, where a Woman
keeps an Office, to feed at certain hours of
the day a great number of Cats, which af|terward
hunt among the Stores for Mice and
Rats. This great Magazine in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
was built in the time of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in the
&s;pace of 9 months and 14 days, in which
time the Lords of the Admiralty gave the
Workmen <HI>drinkgelt</HI> as they call it, to incou|rage
them to work more than at an ordina|ry
rate. At this time, the bigge&s;t Man of
War the States had was the <HI>Amelia,</HI> in which
the famous Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> was kill'd; &s;he
was a Ship of no more than 56 Guns, after|ward
made a Fire-&s;hip. But the States quick|ly
di&s;covered their want of great Ships, and
therefore built, the &s;ame year 20 Men of
War, from 50 to 80 Guns: But the great
Ships built at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> had like to have
proved of no u&s;e, had not the ingenious
Pen&s;ionary <HI>de Wit</HI> found out a device to carry
them over the <HI>Pampus,</HI> betwixt tho&s;e they
call Water Ships.</P>
<P>The Admiralty have an excellent method
in &s;etting out their Fleets, they neither pre&s;s
Soldiers nor Seamen, all go voluntary at the
beating of a Drum, each Captain providing
Men and Provi&s;ions for his Ship, who, after
they have received Orders from the Lords
to the Equipage-Ma&s;ter to equip out their
Ships, and receive the Provi&s;ions of War,
<PB N="32" REF="21">
then the States &s;end aboard each Ship a
Chaplain, and Check-ma&s;ter, who take care
of the provi&s;ion of War, and &s;ee that the
Seamen have the States Allowance, and
whole&s;om Food: And great care is taken by
the Lords, that both Captains and Seamen
receive their Pay punctually for the time
they are in the States Service: And for the
incouraging their Seamen, there is plai&s;tred
on a Board, hanging by the Forema&s;t, the
&s;everal Rewards to &s;uch as either take or fire
a Flag-&s;hip, or take or &s;ink any other Ship of
the Enemies: Al&s;o what Pen&s;ions a wounded
Seaman &s;hall have, if maim'd or di&s;abled in
the States Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords of the Admiralty follow the
&s;ame methods which the States-General ob|&s;erve,
as to their Land Obligations, and go
through this great Charge by the good Ma|nagement
of their Credit; for though it be
true, that they are indebted great Sums of
Money, yet they never want a Supply, nay,
Moneys are often forced upon them by rich
Merchants, who &s;end in their Moneys, and
only take the Admiralties Obligations, with
which they afterward pay their Cu&s;toms,
when their Ships arrive, at which time the
Admiralty allows them Intere&s;t for the time
they have had their Money: And this is it
that makes the Admiralties Obligations more
valued than ready Money, for it &s;aves the
trouble of telling: And &s;uch is the Credit
<PB N="33" REF="21">
of the Admiralty, that when they have oc|ca&s;ion
for any Goods, the People &s;trive to
furni&s;h them, and rather take their Obliga|tions
than Money, becau&s;e they get Intere&s;t;
and all other A&s;&s;ignments upon the Admi|ralty
are very punctually paid, and without
Exchequer Fees; no they are Sworn Offi|cers,
who are forbid to receive any Monies
for Fees, being contented with the Sallery
they have of the States. And their methods
u&s;ed at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for loading or un|loading
Ships are very ea&s;ie, in&s;omuch, that
the Women generally have the charging and
di&s;charging the Ships at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,
which is a great Policy in the States to make
Trade ea&s;ie for the Encouragement of the
Merchants: And the Admiralty are very
grateful and generous unto their Comman|ders;
if any of their Admirals, or Captains
are kill'd at Sea, and have done any con&s;i|derable
Service, they then Eternize their
Memories with la&s;ting Trophies of Honour,
as you may &s;ee by tho&s;e Stately Monuments
of <HI>Trump, Updam, de Ruiter,</HI> the <HI>Ever&s;ons,</HI>
and others; nor are they &s;paring in be&s;tow|ing
large Gifts and Pen&s;ions on the Widows,
and Children of tho&s;e as have &s;erved them
Faithfully and Valiantly in the Wars, whil&s;t
the Treacherous and Cowards meet with the
&s;everity they de&s;erve; I might here in the
next place, inlarge and tell you of the excel|lent
methods they have in Building, and
<PB N="34" REF="22">
pre&s;erving their Ships when Built, but I &s;hall
refer you to that excellent Peice written by
the <HI>Heer Wit&s;en</HI> on that Subject. And &s;hall
now in the next place &s;ay &s;omething of their
Famous Company, called the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company of the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> this Company
is &s;aid to be a Commonwealth within a
Commonwealth, and it is true, if you con&s;i|der
the Soveraign Power and Privileges they
have granted them by the States General,
and likewi&s;e con&s;ider their Riches, and va&s;t
number of Subjects, and the many Territo|ries
and Colonies they po&s;&s;e&s;s in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
they are &s;aid to have 30000 Men in
con&s;tant Pay, and above 200 Capital Ships,
be&s;ides Sloops, Ketches, and Yachts. This
Company hath by their Politick Contrivances,
and Sedulous Indu&s;try po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves
of many Colonies formerly belonging unto
the Spaniards, Portugui&s;es, and divers In|dian
Princes, and as good Chri&s;tians have
been at great Charge in Planting the Go&s;pel
of Chri&s;t in many parts there, Printing in
the Indian Language Bibles, and Prayer
Books, and Catechi&s;ms, for the In&s;truction
of the Indians, maintaining Mini&s;ters and
School-ma&s;ters, to inform tho&s;e that are
Converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith: And now,
becau&s;e I have &s;aid that this Company is &s;o
con&s;iderable, and as it were a Common|wealth
apart, I will demon&s;trate it to be &s;o;
fir&s;t by their Power, Riches, and Strength
<PB N="35" REF="22">
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;econdly, what Figure they
make in <HI>Europe,</HI> and this very briefly, for if
I &s;hould &s;peak of every particular, as to
their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it would &s;well
into many Volumes, but I will only begin
with them at the <HI>Cape de bonne E&s;perance,</HI>
where they have built a Royal Fort, in which
they maintain a Gari&s;on of Soldiers to defend
their Ships which come there to take in fre&s;h
Water: From thence let us take a view of
them in the I&s;land of <HI>Java;</HI> where they have
built a fair City called <HI>Battavia,</HI> and Fortified
it with Ba&s;tions, after the mode of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI>
This City is the place of Re&s;idence of
their grand Mini&s;ter of State, called the Ge|neral
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> he hath allowed him Six
Privy Coun&s;ellors in Ordinary, and Two
Extraordinary, the&s;e govern the Concerns
of the Company throughout the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
they make Peace and War, &s;end their Am|ba&s;&s;adors
to all parts thereof, as occa&s;ion re|quireth.
This General hath his Guards of
Hor&s;e and Foot, and all &s;orts of Officers and
Servants, as if he were a Soveraign Prince,
the whole Expence whereof is defrayed out
of the Companies Stock. This General hath
much of the direction of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and other
parts of the I&s;land of <HI>Java:</HI> From whence
let us take a view of them in their great
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, and tho&s;e
of <HI>Banda,</HI> where they are become &s;o formi|dable,
that they look as if they aimed at the
<PB N="36" REF="23">
Soveraignty of the South Seas: They have
al&s;o a great Trade in <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> from
whence let us return to the I&s;lands of <HI>Suma|tra,</HI>
and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bengale,</HI> where
they have &s;everal Lodges: In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they have
likewi&s;e great Commerce, and are &s;o con&s;i|derable,
that they wage War with that
mighty Monarch if he wrongs them in their
Trade. They al&s;o have &s;everal Colonies and
Lodges on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Cor|mandel,</HI>
and in the Country of the Great
<HI>Mogul,</HI> and King of <HI>Galcanda,</HI> but princi|pally
let us behold them in the rich I&s;land of
<HI>Zeylon,</HI> where they are Ma&s;ters of the plain
Country, &s;o that the Emperor, or King of that
I&s;land, is forced to live in the Mountains,
whil&s;t this Company po&s;&s;e&s;s the City of <HI>Co|lomba,</HI>
and other the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ga|ri&s;ons
of that I&s;land: It is &s;aid, that the Com|pany
hath there in their pay 3600 Soldiers,
and at lea&s;t 300 Guns Planted in their Forts
and Gari&s;ons; in a word, they are not only
Ma&s;ters of the Cinnamon, but of all other
Spices except Pepper, and that they would
al&s;o have, had it been for their Intere&s;t to
Ingro&s;s, but they wi&s;ely fore&s;aw that the
Engli&s;h would be a block in their way, there|fore
they contented them&s;elves to be Ma&s;ters
of the Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves, and Nut|megs,
with which they not only &s;erve <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
but many places in the <HI>Indies;</HI> I will

&s;ee what Figure they make in <HI>Europe.</HI> And
fir&s;t to begin with them in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
where they have two large &s;tately Palaces,
one being in the old part of the City, and
the other in the new; in that of the old part
of the City they keep their Court, and there
&s;its the Re&s;ident Committee of the Company,
where al&s;o they make the Sales of the Com|panies
Goods. There for &s;ix years the grand

meet, and after &s;ix years are expired, the
grand Council of the Seventeen do a&s;&s;emble
at <HI>Middelburg</HI> in <HI>Zealand</HI> for two years, and
then again return to <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> the other

<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> have the Honour of
that grand Council. I will therefore crave
leave to de&s;cribe unto you the Chamber of
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> it being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
of the Chambers belonging to this Famous
Company: In their Hou&s;e or Palace, within
the old City, are many large Offices or A|partments;
as fir&s;t, on the lower Floor is
their Parliament Chamber, where the Seven|teen
do &s;it; next to this Chamber are &s;eve|ral
fair Chambers for the Committees to &s;it
in. They have al&s;o a Chamber of Audi|ence,
where they do receive Princes or Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
or other great Men as have occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak with them. In one of the&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="24">
Chambers are the Arms of &s;everal Indian
Princes they have Conquered. On the &s;ame
Floor is their Trea&s;ury Office, where their
Receivers &s;it and receive Money, and Pay
out the Orders or A&s;&s;ignments of the Com|pany;
near to that Chamber &s;its their grand
Mini&s;ter, the Heer <HI>Peter van Dam,</HI> who is
&s;aid to be a &s;econd <HI>John de Wit</HI> for Parts, tho'
not &s;o in Principle: This great Mini&s;ter is a
Man of indefatagable Indu&s;try, and labours
Night and Day in the Companies Service;
he Reads over twice the great Journal Books
which come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and out of them
makes Minutes to prepare matters of Con|cern
nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered by the grand
Council of Seventeen, and by the inferiour
Committees of the Company, and prepares
In&s;tructions and Orders to be &s;ent to their
Chief Mini&s;ters in the <HI>Indies;</HI> I could &s;ay
many more things of his great Worth and
Virtues, but &s;hall forbear le&s;t I &s;hould be

you may &s;ee the Names of all the Men and
Women that have ever &s;erved the Company

or departing the Companies Service: Then
<PB N="39" REF="24">
next to that is a Council Chamber, where
the Re&s;iding Chamber, or Committee of the

Stairs, there &s;it their Book-holders, who keep
the Accounts of all the Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e

Rooms, in which are great Stores of Pack'd
Goods, and al&s;o a Room with all &s;orts of
Drugs, Tea, Wax, Ambergreace, and Musk;
and on the &s;ame Floor is a Chamber where
the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;it, who govern the Pack-hou&s;es;

the &s;everal Books of Divinity, Printed in the
Indian Language, that are &s;ent to the &s;everal

in the old part of the City, I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;ome|thing
of the manner or method u&s;ed in the
Tran&s;actions of the Jews and others, who
make a Trade of Buying and Selling the
Actions of the Company, the which is a great
My&s;tory of Iniquity, and where it inricheth
one Man, it ruins an hundred. The Jews
are the chief in that Trade, and are &s;aid to
Negotiate 17 parts of 20 in the Company;
The&s;e Actions are bought and &s;old four times
a day, at 8 in the Morning in the Jews-&s;treet,
at a 11 on the Dam, at 12 and at one a
Clock upon the Exchange, and at &s;ix in the
Evening on the Dam, and in the Colleges or
Clubs of the Jews until 12 at midnight,
where many times the crafty Jews, and others
have contrived to coin bad News to make
the Actions fall, and good News to rai&s;e
them, the which Craft of doing at <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI>
is not taken notice of, which is much
to be wondred at, in &s;uch a Wi&s;e Govern|ment
as <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is; for it is a certain
Truth, they many times &s;pread Scandalous
Reports touching the Affairs of State, which
pa&s;s among&s;t the Ignorant for Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="25">
I &s;hall now in the next place &s;ay &s;ome|thing
of their Palace, or Magazine, in the
new part of the City, the which may more
properly be called an Ar&s;enal: It is a Build|ing
&s;o &s;uperb, that it looks more like a Kings
Palace, than a Magazine for Merchants: I
have mea&s;ured the Ground on which this
Ar&s;enal &s;tands, which I find to be 2000
Foot, and &s;quare every way, reckoning the
Motes, or Burgals, about it. I remember
the Ingenious Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on</HI> mea&s;ured
the two Rope-Alleys, by telling the Stone-Figures
in the Wall, and found them to be
1800 Foot long, the like whereof is not to
be &s;een in the World. On the back&s;ide
of this Rope-Alley lies a &s;tore of Five Hun|dred
large Anchors, be&s;ides &s;mall ones; in
this Ar&s;enal they build the Ships belonging
to this Chamber: And here are all &s;orts of
Work-hou&s;es for the Artificers that &s;erve the
Company. And in a Chamber next to
the Joyners Office, is a model of a Ship,
they now build their Ships by, which co&s;t
6000 Gilders. When a Man beholds the
great Stores of Timber, Cordage, and the
Provi&s;ions of War in their Magazine, a Man
would think there were enough to furni&s;h
a whole Nation: In this Ar&s;enal the Ships
unload their Goods, laid up in &s;everal Apart|ments
in the grand Magazine, and after|ward
is removed to the Hou&s;e in the old

Sale. In the upper part of this large Palace
&s;it the Sail-makers at work; but on the lower
part of this Hou&s;e is an Apartment where
the Committee a&s;&s;emble upon occa&s;ion
of Bu&s;ine&s;s: This Ar&s;enal is not to be &s;een
by Strangers without a Ticket from the Be|winthebbers.
Now all what I have &s;poken
of the&s;e two Hou&s;es, or Magazines, doth
only belong unto the Chamber of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI>
There are yet other Chambers of
the Company, who, according to their Quo|ta,
or &s;tock in the Company, have the like
Hou&s;es and Magazines, as the Chambers of
<HI>Zealand, Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</HI> and <HI>En|ku&s;en.</HI>
And now I have named the Six
Chambers, of which the Company is com|po&s;ed,
I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething of their Con|&s;titution,
which is from an Octroy, or Act
of the States-General; by which they have
Sovereign Power over their Servants in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> yea, their Authority reacheth their
Servants in all Territories of the States-Ge|nerals
Dominions: It is Death for any of the
States Subjects to be Interlopers again&s;t this
Company; nor may any, of what Nation
&s;oever, that lives in any of the Companies
Territories, as Burghers or Servants, return
into <HI>Europe</HI> without leave from the Com|pany,
only tho&s;e called Freemen may de|part
without asking leave to remove: The
Grand Councel of this Company is the A&s;|&s;embly
of the Seventeen, which are elected
<PB N="43" REF="26">
out of the &s;everal Chambers before named,
that is, Eight from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and four
from <HI>Zealand; Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</HI> and
<HI>Enku&s;en,</HI> &s;end one a piece, which makes Six|teen,
and the five le&s;&s;er Chambers by turns
cho&s;e the Seventeenth. In the Chamber of
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> there are 20 Bewinthebbers, or
Committee for Management of the Stock, in
ordinary, who are for Life, and have 1000
Ducatoons a Year, and Spices at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI>
and their Travelling Charges, when they go
upon the Companies Service. The next
Chamber is <HI>Zealand,</HI> which hath twelve Be|winthebbers,
who have about 250 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and travelling Charges, and Spices at <HI>Chri&s;t|mas.</HI>
The next is <HI>Delft,</HI> which hath Seven
Bewinthebbers, who have only 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and Travelling Charges and Spices at <HI>Chri&s;t|mas.</HI>
The other Chambers of <HI>Rotterdam,
Horne</HI> and <HI>Enku&s;en,</HI> have &s;even Bewintheb|bers
a piece, and the like Salary, with Tra|velling
Charges and Spices at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> as
the Chamber of <HI>Delft</HI> hath. The&s;e Bewin|thebbers
are elected or cho&s;en out of tho&s;e
<HI>Adventurers</HI> called the High <HI>Participanten</HI> of
the Company: They generally chu&s;e &s;uch
as are Rich, and Men of Parts and Wi&s;dom,
mo&s;t of them being of the Magi&s;tracy of the
Country. No Man is capable of being Ele|cted
a Bewinthebber who hath not 1000 <HI>l.</HI>
Stock in the Company. In a word, this
Grand Council of the Seventeen make Laws
for the Governing the Company, both in
<PB N="44" REF="27">
<HI>India</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> It is they that appoint the
Days of Sale, and what Number of Ships
each Chamber mu&s;t &s;end to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and
likewi&s;e order the Building of Ships, and all
other grand Concerns. This Company is
worthily e&s;teemed a Wi&s;e, Politique, De|&s;erving
Company, &s;paring no co&s;t to get
good Intelligence of Affairs, &s;ending Me&s;|&s;engers
and Expre&s;&s;es over-Land to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI>
They have their <HI>Spies</HI> and <HI>Corre&s;pon|dents</HI>
in all the con&s;iderable Trading Parts of
the World: They have been &s;o indu&s;trious
as to gain the Spice Trade, not only from
the Venetians, Spaniards, Portugui&s;es, French,
Danes, and other European Nations, but
have al&s;o Ingro&s;&s;ed all the Spices; &s;o that,
as I told you before, they &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Spices to the
Indians them&s;elves: But this I mu&s;t &s;ay for
them, that they are a Generous Company,
and gratefully paying Re&s;pects where it is
due, as lately they have Complemented his
Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> His pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with an An|nual
Sum out of the Profits of their Compa|ny,
to make him their Friend and Prote|ctor.
Neither are they backward in be&s;tow|ing
Pre&s;ents upon Strangers that have obli|ged
them, as I could in&s;tance in &s;ome of our
own Nation. They are al&s;o very charitable
to the Poor, giving them the Thou&s;andth
Gilder of all the Goods they &s;ell. And to
all the Reformed Mini&s;ters in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="27">
they &s;end Spices at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> to pray every
<HI>Sunday</HI> for the Welfare and Pro&s;perity of the
Company. To conclude, this Company is
a Buckler and Defence for the Common|wealth
upon all urgent Occa&s;ions: And tru|ly
our Engli&s;h <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company</HI> might be
the &s;ame to our King, if the Differences be|tween
the Two Companies were compo&s;ed;
e&s;pecially now they have &s;uch a great King
to protect them, and that the Interlopers
are de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And now it is high time I &s;hould tell you
the Methods a Stranger mu&s;t take if he hath
occa&s;ion to keep Hou&s;e in <HI>Am&s;terdam:</HI> If a
Man will hire an Hou&s;e, he mu&s;t take a
Lea&s;e upon Seal'd Paper, for which you
mu&s;t pay a Tax to the States, and pay the
Broaker that makes the Bargain: But before
you can buy a Hou&s;e, you mu&s;t be in a capa|city
to be made a Burgher. To this purpo&s;e it
is u&s;ual to take with you to the Stadthou&s;e
your Broaker, or any two Securities, and
there before the Burgherma&s;ters take the
Oath of Burgher&s;chap, which is to be faith|ful
to the City, to the Magi&s;trates and Go|vernment,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if you buy either Land
or Hou&s;es, and lodge&punc; privately, you will find
your ca&s;e much wor&s;e; then you mu&s;t pay
a Legion of Taxes to the Mills that drain
your Lands, and for maintaining the Banks
and Sluces; and if the States have occa&s;ion
to build a Fortification on your Lands, or
<PB N="46" REF="28">
to drown them in time of War, you mu&s;t
be contented with the States Terms: And
if your Hou&s;e or Hou&s;es &s;tand empty with|out
Tenants, yet you mu&s;t pay the States
Taxes on that Hou&s;e or Hou&s;es. Thus much
for the Method how you are to be advanced
to be a Burgher of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to give
you a ta&s;te what you are to pay for Hou&s;es
or Land, if you &s;ettle there; and if you have
either purcha&s;ed or hired an Hou&s;e, then
comes an Officer from the Stadthou&s;e, with
a Printed Sealed Paper, who tells you, you
mu&s;t pay as followeth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A Pole-Tax for every Male and Fe|male
Servant in the Hou&s;e above eight Years
old, &s;ix Gilders a Year.</P>
<P>For a Coach, if you keep one, 75 Gil|ders
a Year.</P>
<P>For a Coach without Wheels, 50 Gilders
a Year.</P>
<P>For Soap, as the Number of the Family
is.</P>
<P>The like for Salt.</P>
<P>For Wine, as your Quality is.</P>
<P>To the Watch, as your Hou&s;e is in Great|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To the Lanthorns, as the largene&s;s of the
Hou&s;e is.</P>
<P>For Butter, every 20 Pound &s;even Sti|vers.</P>
<P>For Beans, half as much as you pay for
the Beans.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="28">
For Turff, every Tun five Stivers.</P>
<P>For every 20 Gilders in Wood, &s;ix Gil|ders.</P>
<P>For Fle&s;h the Tax often changeth.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Tax on the Bread.</P>
<P>Then there is a Tax called the 200th
Penny, and a Tax called the 8th: Then
there are many Taxes in Trade, as that no
Man can weigh or mea&s;ure out his own
Goods if &s;old in gro&s;s, but the States Offi|cers
mu&s;t do it. Then the States have a Tax
called the <HI>Verpounding</HI> on all Lands and Hou|&s;es
in their Dominions. Then they have a
Tax on Seal'd Paper, and a Tax for Regi|&s;tering
Land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Hou&s;es; likewi&s;e a Tax on
Cows, Hor&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Calves, and on all &s;ort of
Fruit. There are many other Taxes I could
name, as a Stiver for every Man that goes
out or into any City after the Hour of &s;hut|ting
the Gates. Al&s;o you pay for going
over &s;ome Bridges, and pa&s;&s;ing through
Gates called <HI>Tolhek,</HI> a Stiver for every Per|&s;on;
but Coaches, Wagons or Hor&s;es pay
more. The&s;e I have already named, you
will &s;ay, are too many; yet I may not for|get
to tell you, that Milk fir&s;t pays as Milk;
and again if it be made Butter; yea, the
Buttermilk and Whay pays a Tax likewi&s;e,
for all which a Man would think that a Peo|ple
that &s;tand &s;o much upon maintaining of
their Liberty &s;hould Mutiny, and refu&s;e pay|ment:
But this &s;eldom happens; and if it
<PB N="48" REF="29">
doth, the States puni&s;h them very &s;everely.
I remember that in my time there was a
Mutiny at <HI>Sardam</HI> about paying a new Tax,
whereupon the States &s;ent a Regiment of
their Souldiers, and &s;eized the Heads of the
Mutineers, and hanged up five or &s;ix of them
at the Towns end, and &s;everely whipt eight
under the Gallows. And in the rich City
of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> if any refu&s;e to pay their Tax,
the Magi&s;trates &s;end their Officer to pull off
their Doors; and if they remain long ob|&s;tinate,
they &s;end and fetch away the lower
Windows of their Hou&s;e, and they dare not
put up others, until they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">id the Taxes.
However, this is ob&s;ervable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> if any Man
will &s;wear he is not worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> he is taxed
at, then he is free: But there are many &s;o
proud, that they will not let the World
know their Condition. I knew a Merchant
named <HI>Ornia,</HI> who paid during the War for
his 200th Penny, and other Taxes for his
and his Wives Children, (having had two
Rich Wives) 14000 Pounds Sterling. I al|&s;o
knew an Engli&s;h Anabapti&s;t Merchant,
who told the Engli&s;h Envoy in my pre|&s;ence,
That he had paid near 4000 <HI>l.</HI> Ster|ling
to the War, and yet the &s;ame Man did
Grumble to pay his Maje&s;ties Con&s;ul a pity|ful
Fee or Con&s;ulat-Money on his Ships:
The rea&s;on whereof I once asked him, who
an&s;wered me, That the King could not rai&s;e
a Penny in <HI>England</HI> without his Parliament,
<PB N="49" REF="29">
and therefore much le&s;s could he do it in the
States Country. Thus the&s;e Phanaticks had
rather make Bricks without Straw, than pay
the lea&s;t Tribute to their Natural Prince's
Officer. Should we in <HI>England</HI> be obliged
to pay the Taxes that are here impo&s;ed,
there would be Rebellion upon Rebellion:
And yet after all that is here paid, no Man
may bake his own Bread, or grind his own
Corn, or brew his Beer, nor dare any Man
keep in his Hou&s;e a Hand-Mill, although it
be but to grind Mu&s;tard or Coffee. I re|member
one Mrs. <HI>Guyn</HI> a Coffee-Woman at
<HI>Rotterdam,</HI> had like to have been ruined for
grinding her own Coffee, had not Sir <HI>Lyonel
Jenkins</HI> employed his Secretary Doctor <HI>Wyn</HI>
to intreat the States on her behalf; and it
was reckoned a grand favour that &s;he was
only fined, and not bani&s;hed the City, and
forfeiture made of all her Goods. I remem|ber
al&s;o a Landlord of mine in <HI>Leyden</HI> bought
a live Pig in the Market, and innocently
brought it home, and kill'd it, for which he
had like to have been ruined, becau&s;e he did
not fir&s;t &s;end to the Exci&s;emen to exci&s;e it,
and al&s;o let the Vi&s;itors &s;ee that the Pig was
free from Di&s;ea&s;es. At another time a Wine-Merchant
coming to give me a Vi&s;it, told me
that he had the rare&s;t Rheni&s;h in the City,
and that if I would &s;end my Maid to his Cel|lar
with &s;ix Bottles, they &s;hould be fill'd:
Whereupon I &s;ent the Maid only with two
<PB N="50" REF="30">
Bottles, and charged her to hide them un|der
her Apron&punc; but &s;uch was her misfor|tune,
that the Scouts Dienaers met her, and
&s;eized her and her Bottles, and carried her
to Pri&s;on, which co&s;t the Wine-Merchant
1500 Gilders; and had it not been for the
&s;tronge&s;t Sollicitations made by us, he had
been ruined: So &s;acred are Taxes here, and
mu&s;t &s;o exactly be paid. And were they
not here &s;o preci&s;e, it were impo&s;&s;ible for
&s;o &s;mall a Country to &s;ub&s;i&s;t: And therefore
you may hear the Inhabitants generally &s;ay,
that what they &s;uffer is for their <HI>Vaderland:</HI>
Hence the meane&s;t among them are content
to pay what is laid on them, for they &s;ay all
what is the <HI>Vaderlands</HI> is ours, the Men of
War are theirs, the &s;umptuous Magazins,
Bridges, and every thing what is the <HI>Vader|lands.</HI>
And indeed in a &s;en&s;e it is &s;o, for
they have this to comfort them, that if it
plea&s;e God to vi&s;it them with Poverty, they
and their Children have the Publick Pur&s;e
to maintain them; and this is one main Rea&s;on
why they &s;o willingly pay their Taxes as they
do; for there's not a Soul born in the States
Dominions that wants warm Cloaths and
Dyet, and good Lodging, if they make their
ca&s;e known to the Magi&s;trates. And for the
Vagabonds that rove up and down the
Streets, they are either Walloons, or other
Strangers as pretend to have been ruined by
the late Wars.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="30">
I &s;hall now in the next place let you
know how excellently the Laws are here
executed again&s;t Fraud and Perjury, and
the Intention of Murders; which Laws were
once much u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> as you &s;hall
hear hereafter when I &s;peak of the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburgh</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;tance a few particulars that
happened in my time: There was a Spark
that made fal&s;e A&s;&s;ignments on the Admi|ralty,
who tho' related to many of the Ma|gi&s;trates
of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> had his Head cut off;
and another who was a Clerk in the Mer|chants
Bank, who made fal&s;e Po&s;ts in their
Books, and had his Head al&s;o cut off; and all
the Portions he had given with his Daughters,
the Husbands were forced to pay back, and
all his Hou&s;es and Goods were &s;old at his
Door in the open Streets: I knew a French
Marquis, who &s;wore his Regiment was com|pleat,
and when the States knew that he had
not half his Regiment, he likewi&s;e had his
Head cut off in the Pri&s;on in the <HI>Hague:</HI> I
al&s;o knew a French Pedagogue, a Runagado
Monk, who de&s;igned to have Murdered his
Ma&s;ter Major <HI>Cavellio,</HI> and his two Pupils,
young Children of the Majors, and after|ward
to &s;et the Hou&s;e a Fire to colour the
Murder, he had his Head cut off and &s;et
upon a Po&s;t, with his Body on a Wheel near
the <HI>Hague.</HI> I could Name you two other
Cheaters, who were &s;everely whipt under
<PB N="52" REF="31">
the Gallows; and two under Farmers who
de&s;igned to run away with the States Money.</P>
<P>The Cheat of breaking with a full Hand
is not &s;o frequent in <HI>Holland</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI>
(where &s;ome u&s;e it as a way to &s;lip out of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and then to live conveniently after|ward
upon the E&s;tates of other Men) be|cau&s;e
in <HI>Holland</HI> they are more &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed
when di&s;covered than in <HI>England:</HI>
As on the contrary, tho&s;e that fall to decay
through Lo&s;&s;es, and unavoidable Accidents
which they could not prevent, find a more
&s;peedy and ea&s;ie way of Compounding and
Fini&s;hing Matters with their Creditors if they
be over-&s;trict, than the Cu&s;tom or Law
of <HI>England</HI> doth afford, for the &s;uing out of
Statutes of Bankrupts in <HI>England</HI> doth prove
many times &s;o pernicious both to Creditor
and Debtor through the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the
Proceedings, and the expen&s;ivene&s;s of Exe|cuting
the Commi&s;&s;ions, that what by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
Fees, Treats, and other incident
Charges, the Creditors are put to &s;uch Ex|pences
as to be utterly di&s;appointed of their
Debt, and the Poor Debtors for ever ruined
and undone; I &s;hall therefore in this place
give a &s;hort Relation of the method u&s;ed in
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in the ca&s;e of Bankrupts, which
perhaps may be taken notice of by our King
and Parliament, for the preventing Di&s;or|ders
and &s;ad Abu&s;es that daily happen in
Executing the Statutes of Bankrupts: The
<PB N="53" REF="31">
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> every year Name
Commi&s;&s;ioners for Bankrupts, out of tho&s;e
that make up a Judicature, like to our Courts
of Aldermen in <HI>London;</HI> The&s;e meet certain
days in the Week in a di&s;tinct Chamber in
the Stadthou&s;e, over who&s;e Door is cut in
Marble the Emblem of Fortune flying away
with Wings, and round Che&s;ts turn'd up&s;ide
down, with Mice and Rats Eating the Mo|ney-Bags,
Pens, Inkhorns, and Paper-Books.
There they receive Petitions from Debtors
and Creditors, and as occa&s;ion requireth,
&s;ummon the Parties to appear before them,
and to lay open the true State of the matter;
this done, they either by Authority &s;eize the
Bankrupts Books and Effects, or el&s;e without
any &s;tir and noi&s;e leave all remaining in the
Debtors Hou&s;es, and &s;end thither two Com|mittees
to examine the Books, and make an
Inventory of the E&s;tate, with power to com|po&s;e
the matter, without giving much trou|ble
to the Parties. If the Commi&s;&s;ioners
find that the Debtor is come to decay by
unexpected Lo&s;&s;es, and unavoidable Acci|dents,
to which he did not at all contribute,
it is their u&s;ual way to propo&s;e to the Cre|ditor
&s;uch amicable and ea&s;ie Terms, as the
Poor Man may be able to perform, alotting
&s;ometimes the half of the E&s;tate left to the
Debtor, &s;ometimes a third part, and &s;ome|times
per&s;wading the Creditors to advance
to the Poor Man a Sum of Money to help
<PB N="54" REF="32">
him up again in Trade, upon Condition that
he do oblige him&s;elf to pay the Creditors all
he oweth them, when God &s;hall be plea&s;ed
to make him able; but on the contrary, if
the Commi&s;&s;ioners find that a Trader hath
dealt Knavi&s;hly, and broken with a de&s;ign to
Defraud and Cheat his Creditors, as if it ap|pear
that a Bankrupt hath kept fal&s;e Books,
and counterfeited Bills of Exchange, Bills of
Loading, or pretended Commi&s;&s;ions from
Foreign Parts; in &s;uch a ca&s;e they are very
&s;evere, and not only &s;eize all the Books and
Effects of the Bankrupt, but al&s;o Impri&s;on
him, and al&s;o puni&s;h him Corporally; and
if the cheat be of an heinous Nature, Sen|tence
him &s;ometime to Death; whereas, if
the Debtor be only Unfortunate, and no ways
Knavi&s;h, then the Commi&s;&s;aries u&s;e all the
Power they have to force the Creditors to
accept the Poor Mans Terms, the which is
better for the Creditors than to u&s;e the ri|gour
of the Law, in committing the Poor
Man to Pri&s;on, &s;eeing in that ca&s;e the Cre|ditors
mu&s;t maintain him in Pri&s;on according
to his Quality, where if he lies a certain time,
and the Creditors be not able to prove the
Pri&s;oner hath an E&s;tate, then the Debtor is
admitted to his Oath to Swear he is not worth
40 Gilders, be&s;ides his wearing Cloths and
working Tools, and then he is &s;et at liberty;
but in the mean time let the Pri&s;oner have a
care not to make a fal&s;e Oath, for then he is
<PB N="55" REF="32">
puni&s;hed without Mercy, an in&s;tance of
which happened in my time.</P>
<P>The States having admitted a certain Jew
to come and make &s;uch an Oath before them,
were at the &s;ame time informed by the Goaler,
that this Jew had been &s;een through the
chinks of the Door, quilting Ducats of Gold,
and &s;ome Diamonds in his Cloaths, to the
value of 5000 Gilders. The States hereupon
admoni&s;hed the Jew to take heed to what
he was about to Swear, becau&s;e the Law was
very &s;trict again&s;t &s;uch as made fal&s;e Oaths
before them, and at the &s;ame time cau&s;ed
the Oath, and the Law to be Read unto
him; neverthele&s;s the Jew offered to take
the Oath, but the Lords not &s;uffering him to
Swear, becau&s;e then he mu&s;t die by Law,
cau&s;ed him to be taken out into another
Room and &s;earched, where they found a|bout
him the Ducats and Diamonds: This
being told the Lords, they &s;ent for him in,
and then Sentenced him to have 60 La&s;hes
under the Gallows, and to be Bani&s;hed the
Country; yet, becau&s;e the Jew had many
Children, they gave the third part of what
was taken about him to his Wife and Chil|dren,
and a third to the Poor, and the other
third to the Creditors, which was enough
to pay them their Debt: The&s;e Commi&s;&s;io|ners
are paid by the States, and have not a
Doit from Debtors or Creditors, for all what
they do: The&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners are al&s;o
<PB N="56" REF="33">
much to be commended for their readine&s;s
to do good Offices to tho&s;e Poor Merchants,
who having lived hone&s;tly, are brought to
decay by Lo&s;&s;es and Cro&s;&s;es in their Trade;
who when they find any &s;uch &s;o Poor that
they can neither pay their Creditors, nor
maintain the charge of their Families, it is
their con&s;tant Cu&s;tom, to take their Chil|dren
from them, and maintain and bring
them up in their Ho&s;pitals; yea, often al&s;o
&s;olliciting the Burgherma&s;ters on their be|half,
to be&s;tow &s;ome &s;mall Office upon them
for their Relief and Sub&s;i&s;tance. And here
I mu&s;t not omit to acquaint you, that as the
Compounding of Matters in <HI>Holland</HI> betwixt
Debtor and Creditor, &s;o as hath been &s;aid, is
very ea&s;ie and equitable, &s;o is al&s;o their way
or method of &s;uing for Debts very favorable,
which is after this manner; In the fir&s;t place,
a Note or Summons is left at the Debtors
Hou&s;e, and if he neglect to appear, a &s;econd
Summons is &s;ent, but then if he neither ap|pear
him&s;elf, or &s;end his Proctor, the Sheriffs
order an Arre&s;t again&s;t him; and at la&s;t,
when he is brought before them, if the matter
be difficult, it is referred to two or three
good Men of the City, and time given him;
but if the Plaintiff make Oath, that he ap|prehends
the Debtor hath a de&s;ign to run a|way,
then mu&s;t the Pri&s;oner either give Bail,
or return to Pri&s;on. It is a Remark that I
have made in my Travels, that excepting
<PB N="57" REF="33">
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> I never &s;aw in any Pri|&s;on
above forty Pri&s;oners for Debt at one
time, and in &s;ome great Towns, as in <HI>Haer|lem</HI>
and others, &s;ometimes not one; and the
Rea&s;on hereof is plain, for you cannot lay a
Man in Pri&s;on for an Action or Debt, &s;mall
or great, but you mu&s;t maintain the Pri&s;oner,
&s;o that many times the Charges exceed the
principal Debt, and after all, the Pri&s;oner
can free him&s;elf; whereas the Cu&s;tom in
<HI>England,</HI> encouraged by tho&s;e Varlets the
Pettyfoggers and Catchpoles, of turning a
Man into a Pri&s;on for a Crown, or it may
be for nothing at all, if he cannot find Bail,
he may lie and Starve there, is an abomina|ble
abu&s;e; as al&s;o that of Suborning fal&s;e
Witne&s;&s;es, which is extreamly cried out a|gain&s;t
beyond Sea.</P>
<P>And now becau&s;e I am Speaking of Petty|foggers,
give me leave to tell you a Story I
met with when I lived in <HI>Rome,</HI> going with
a Roman to &s;ee &s;ome Antiquities, he &s;hewed
me a Chapel, Dedicated to one St. <HI>Evona,</HI> a
Lawyer of <HI>Britain,</HI> who he &s;aid came to <HI>Rome</HI>
to intreat the Pope to give the Lawyers of
<HI>Britain</HI> a Patron, to which the Pope replied,
That he knew of no Saint but what was di&s;|po&s;ed
of to other Profe&s;&s;ions; at which <HI>Evona</HI>
was very &s;ad, and earne&s;tly beg'd of the Pope
to think of one for them: At la&s;t, the Pope
propo&s;ed to St. <HI>Evona,</HI> that he &s;hould go
round the Church of St. <HI>John de Latera</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="34">
Blindfold, and after he had &s;aid &s;o many <HI>Ave
Maria</HI>'s, that the fir&s;t Saint he laid hold of
&s;hould be his Patron, which the good old
Lawyer willingly undertook; and at the end
of his <HI>Ave Maria</HI>'s, he &s;topt at St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s
Altar, where he laid hold of the Devil under
St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Feet, and cry'd out, This is our
Saint, let him be our Patron; &s;o being un|blindfolded,
and &s;eeing what a Patron he had
cho&s;en, he went to his Lodgings &s;o dejected,
that in few Months after he Died, and com|ing
to Heavens Gates, knockt hard; where|upon
St. <HI>Peter</HI> asked, Who it was that knockt
&s;o boldly, he replied, That he was St. <HI>Evona</HI>
the Advocate: Away, away, &s;aid St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
here is but one Advocate in Heaven, here
is no room for you Lawyers. O but, &s;aid St.
<HI>Evona,</HI> I am that hone&s;t Lawyer who never
took Fees on both &s;ides, or ever pleaded in
a bad Cau&s;e; nor did I ever &s;et my Neigh|bours
together by the Ears, or lived by the
Sins of the People. Well then, &s;aid St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
come in: This news coming down to <HI>Rome,</HI>
a witty Poet writ upon St. <HI>Evona</HI>'s Tomb
the&s;e words; St. <HI>Evona un Briton, Advocat
non Larron, Hallelujah.</HI> This Story put me
in mind of <HI>Ben. John&s;on</HI>'s going through a
Chruch in <HI>Surrey,</HI> &s;eeing Poor People weep|ing
over a Grave, asked one of the Women,
Why they wept? O &s;aid &s;he, we have lo&s;t
our precious Lawyer, Ju&s;tice <HI>Randal,</HI> he kept
us all in Peace, and always was &s;o good as
<PB N="59" REF="34">
to keep us from going to Law, the be&s;t Man
that ever lived, Well, &s;aid <HI>Ben. John&s;on,</HI> I will
&s;end you an Epitaph to write upon his Tomb,
which was,</P>
<Q><L>God works Wonders now and than,</L>
<L>Here lies a Lawyer an hone&s;t Men.</L></Q>
<P>And truly old <HI>Ben.</HI> was in the right, for in
my time I have ob&s;erved &s;ome Gentlemen of
that Profe&s;&s;ion, that have not acted like
St. <HI>Evona,</HI> or Ju&s;tice <HI>Randal,</HI> I will &s;ay no
more of them, but wi&s;h them as great Fees,
and as much encouragement as the Lawyers
have in <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>I now come to Speak &s;omething of the
three Taxes I mentioned in the former part
of my Remarks on Taxes, of which the fir&s;t
ought rather to be called an u&s;eful and pub|lick
Invention, like to that of the In&s;urance
Office in <HI>London,</HI> then a publick Tax, &s;eeing
no Man needs contribute to it unle&s;s they
plea&s;e, and find his profit by it; but the o|ther
may be called Taxes, becau&s;e the Sub|jects
are obliged to &s;ubmit to them, but then
they are &s;o ea&s;ie, that what the publick gets
thereby, not only le&s;&s;ons extraordinary Sub|&s;idies,
which many times occa&s;ions clamour,
when becau&s;e of their Rarity, and the ur|gency
of Occa&s;ions, they mu&s;t needs be
great.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="35">
Yet it is &s;ufficiently Compen&s;ated by the
advantage and &s;ecurity in the E&s;tates, which
private Per&s;ons, who are obliged to pay it,
reap thereby daily: I am confident, that if
the King and Parliament thought fit to intro|duce
&s;ome, or all three of the&s;e Taxes into
<HI>England,</HI> the publick charge of Government
might be defrayed with more ea&s;e, and with
le&s;s repining and clamour, than when it mu&s;t
be done by new and high Impo&s;itions; how|ever,
our Governors are the proper Judges of
that.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t then is an Hou&s;e called the
Merchants Bank, which is governed by di|vers
Commi&s;&s;ioners, Clerks, and Book|keepers,
likewi&s;e an E&s;&s;ay-Ma&s;ter, who judgeth
of the Gold and Silver, that at any time is
brought into the Bank uncoined: The &s;ecu|rity
given for pre&s;ervation thereof, are the
States and Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> Now
if you have a mind to put Money into the
Bank, &s;uppo&s;e 1000 <HI>l.</HI> le&s;s or more, you
mu&s;t go to the Clerks, and ask a Folio for
your Name, and then pay in your Money
at three or four <HI>per Cent.</HI> according as the rate
of the Bank-Money is high or low, or you
may buy it of tho&s;e called Ca&s;hiers or Brokers;
then get the Clerks to &s;et down in the Folio
what you bring in; having done &s;o, you may
draw this Sum, or &s;ell it in what parcels you
plea&s;e; but then if you let your Money lie
&s;even years in the Bank, you receive no Intere&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="35">
for the &s;ame. If you ask, Where then is the
Advantage for the Merchants? I an&s;wer, fir&s;t,
you have your Money ready at all times for
an&s;wering Bills of Exchange, and making other
Payments: You are at no charge for Bags or
Portage, at no lo&s;s by fal&s;e tale, or bad Mo|ney,
in no danger of Thieves, or unfaithful
Servants, or Fire; and above all, you have
the Accounts of your Ca&s;h mo&s;t punctually
and ju&s;tly kept without any trouble, or run|ning
the risk of Gold&s;mith or Ca&s;hierers
breaking in your Debt; for &s;uch is their
care; that twice a Year, or &s;ometimes oft|ner,
they &s;hut up the Bank for 14 Days, and
then all that have Concerns therein, mu&s;t
bring in their Accounts to the Clerks, who
a few Days after, having viewed the Books,
acquaint &s;uch as have brought in wrong Ac|counts
with their Mi&s;takes, de&s;iring them
to return to their Books, and rectifie their
Error, not telling them wherein the mi&s;take
lies: So that I have known Merchants, in
my time, &s;ent back three or four times with
their wrong Accounts: But if they begin to
grow impatient, and &s;ay that they will &s;tand
to their Accounts, then they pay a Mulct to
the Clerks upon their convincing them of
their Mi&s;takes, either by charging too much
upon the Bank, or forgetting or omitting
what was their due. I knew two Merchants,
who having forgot, the one 750 <HI>l.</HI> and the
other 220 <HI>l.</HI> in their Accounts, were hone&s;t|ly
<PB N="62" REF="36">
rectified by the Clerks, &s;o that they &s;u|&s;tained
no Lo&s;s. Be&s;ides this care of the
Clerks in keeping and &s;tating the Accounts,
the Bank is obliged for 5 <HI>l.</HI> a Year to &s;end
to every Merchant that de&s;ires it, their Ac|counts
every Morning before Exchange|time,
of the Moneys written of by them in
in the Bank the Day before upon any Mer|chants
Account, and what Sums are written
of by others upon their Accounts: So that
the Merchants may compare the Banks.
Notes with their Books, and &s;o &s;ave much
of the Charges of Book-keeping.</P>
<P>Now if it be objected, That though this
be an Advantage to the Merchants, yet what
can the Publick gain thereby, &s;eeing the
Charges of paying Officers, Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
mu&s;t needs be very con&s;iderable?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That indeed it is a My&s;tery to
tho&s;e who under&s;tand not the thing; but if
it were once known and practi&s;ed, the Ad|vantage
of it would appear: For among o|ther
things which might be &s;aid, the Magi|&s;trates
of the City take out of the Merchants
Bank a &s;ufficient Stock of Money to &s;upply
the Lumbert, a Bank that lends out Money,
and is Governed by four Commi&s;&s;ioners cho|&s;en
out of the Magi&s;trates, who &s;it in Court
every Day in the Lumbert, which is a large
Pile of Building 300 Foot long, containing
&s;everal Chambers and Magazines under one
Roof; in the&s;e &s;everal Chambers the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="63" REF="36">
have Officers &s;itting to lend Money
upon all &s;orts of Goods, even from a pair of
Shooes to the riche&s;t Jewel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is a
great convenience for Poor People; yea,
for Merchants al&s;o, who &s;ome times may
want Money to pay a Bill of Exchange, and
prevents the Cheating, and extraordinary
Extortion u&s;ed by the Pawn-brokers in <HI>Eng|land,
France,</HI> and other Countries. And be|&s;ides,
the Poor have their Pawns &s;afely and
well pre&s;erved, neither are they punctually
&s;old when the Year is out, or denied under the
pretext of being mi&s;laid, as the Poor are often
times &s;erved by the wicked Pawn-brokers.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another convenience in this
Lumbert, <HI>viz.</HI> an excellent way they have of
di&s;covering Thieves, and the &s;tolen Goods;
they publi&s;h two general open Sales of Goods
pawn'd, twice a year, that &s;uch as will may
redeem their Goods, and paying the Inte|re&s;t
may have them, although the time be
relap&s;ed. Thus much as to the <HI>Lumbert.</HI> I
was once, according to my Duty, to wait
upon the D. of <HI>York,</HI> at the Bank of Mer|chants,
where &s;hewing his Highne&s;s the way
of keeping the Journal-Book of the Bank,
which is of a prodigious bigne&s;s, his Highne&s;s
was extreamly plea&s;ed with the contrivance of
pre&s;erving it from Fire; &s;aying, that the
cour&s;e they took might be of great u&s;e for
the pre&s;erving Patents, and the Deeds of
Noblemens E&s;tates: This contrivance, which
<PB N="64" REF="37">
perhaps may be thought u&s;eful or imitable, I
&s;hall therefore de&s;cribe it: It is a large Fire|&s;tone
&s;haped like a Che&s;t, and &s;et upright in
a Stone-Wall, having a large Bra&s;s Door of
a va&s;t thickne&s;s, with Flaps to fall over and
cover the Lock and Hinges; into this Che&s;t
the Book is drawn upon Rolls, it being of
&s;uch a bulk and weight as cannot be handed
in by a Man, and there it is &s;o &s;ecurely
pre&s;erved, that although the Hou&s;e &s;hould
be burnt, the Book in all probability would
be &s;afe. Should I here give an account of
the va&s;t Sums of Money that daily are writ|ten
of in this Bank, I might probably be
thought to &s;peak at random, but this I may
boldly affirm, that it far exceeds all the Banks
in <HI>Europe,</HI> both for Riches and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
their Credit is &s;uch, that the Italians, French,
Germans, and Engli&s;h have great Sums in
the &s;ame; neither was ever any Man refu&s;ed
his Money in the wor&s;t of times.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Tax is what ari&s;eth from the ju&s;t
and laudable E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Regi&s;ter, a
Tax which I think mo&s;t Men will be willing
to &s;ubmit to, except &s;uch as de&s;ign to cheat
and defraud their Neighbours, and live by
&s;uch like Sins and Confu&s;ion, and for the
mo&s;t part die with the Cur&s;e of the People:
This Regi&s;ter in <HI>Holland</HI> begets &s;uch a&s;&s;u|rance
and &s;afety in Dealing, that in purcha|&s;ing
of Hou&s;es or Land, a Child, though
over-reached in the Value, yet cannot be
cheated as to the Title.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="37">
The Third and la&s;t Tax is that of Sealed
Paper, as it is practi&s;ed in <HI>Holland.</HI> There
are many other things might be &s;poken, as
to the Government of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> but I mu&s;t
not tire your patience. However, one con|&s;iderable
thing I would not pa&s;s by, touching
the Militia: There are in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Sixty
Companies of Foot, the lea&s;t of them having
200 Men, &s;ome 300, which in a mode&s;t
account, amounts at lea&s;t to 15000 Men, in
which number neither Jews nor Anabapti&s;ts
who carry no Arms are reckoned, only they
are obliged to contribute to the maintenance
of the 1400 Soldiers, who are kept in con|&s;tant
pay, as a Guard for the City, and to|wards
the Night-Watch or Rattel-Watch,
who walk the Streets the whole Night to
keep good Orders, and tell us every half
hour what a Clock it is. There are al&s;o up|on
every Church Tower, Trumpeters, who
Sound every half hour; and if any Fire
breaks out in the City, they give a Signal on
which &s;ide of the City the Fire is, and Ring
the Fire-Bell; and they have excellent ways
on a &s;udden in &s;uch &s;ad Accidents to quench
Fire: But I may not inlarge any longer, but
ha&s;ten out of <HI>Holland.</HI> Though before I leave it
it will not be ami&s;s if I give the Reader a Li&s;t
of the Pa&s;&s;age-Boats, which for the conveni|ence
of tho&s;e that Travel that way, I have here

Day, <HI>Sundays</HI> and all, throughout the
Year.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age in the Po&s;t-Wagon for each

<P>And if you are &s;et down by the way you

<P>And now having &s;aid &s;o much of the States
Government, and of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in particu|lar,
it will not be ami&s;s to take notice of &s;ome
bad Cu&s;toms and Practices now in vogue in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and leave it to the Reader to judge
what they may portend: There are Tolle|rated
in the City of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> among&s;t
other abu&s;es, at lea&s;t 50 Mu&s;ick-hou&s;es, where
lewd Per&s;ons of both Sexes meet and pra|cti&s;e
their Villanies: There is al&s;o a place
called the Long-Seller, a Tollerated Exchange,
or publick Meeting Hou&s;e for Whores and
Rogues to Rendezvous in, and make their
filthy Bargains. This Exchange is open from
&s;ix a Clock in the Evening until nine at Night;
every Whore mu&s;t pay three Stivers at the
Door for her Entrance or Admi&s;&s;ion. I
confe&s;s the Mini&s;ters Preach and exclaim
from the Pulpit again&s;t this horrible Abu&s;e,
but who they be that protect them I know
not; yet, I have heard &s;ome plead for the
Tolleration of the&s;e wicked Meetings, upon
pretext, that when the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleets
come home, the Seamen are &s;o mad for
<PB N="71" REF="40">
Women, that if they had not &s;uch Hou&s;es
to bait in, they would force the very Citi|zens
Wives and Daughters; but it is well
known, that as Money does countenance, &s;o
Di&s;cipline might &s;uppre&s;s that abu&s;e. The
old &s;evere, and frugal way of living is now
almo&s;t quite out of date in <HI>Holland,</HI> there is
very little to be &s;een of that &s;ober Mode&s;ty
in Apparel, Diet, and Habitations as for|merly:
In &s;tead of convenient Dwellings,
the Hollanders now build &s;tately Palaces,
have their delightful Gardens, and Hou&s;es of
Plea&s;ure, keep Coaches, Wagons and Sleas,
have very rich Furniture for their Hor&s;es,
with Trappings adorned with Silver Bells. I
have &s;een the Vanity of a Vintners Son, who
had the Bo&s;&s;es of the Bit, and Trapping of
his Hor&s;e of pure Silver; his Toot-Man and
Coach-Man having Silver Fring'd Gloves;
yea, &s;o much is the humour of the Women
altered, and of their Children al&s;o, that no
Apparel can now &s;erve them but the be&s;t and
riche&s;t that <HI>France</HI> and other Countries af|fords;
and their Sons are &s;o much addicted
to Play, that many Families in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> are
ruined by it; not that <HI>England</HI> is le&s;s extra|vagant
then the Dutch; who as I &s;aid be|fore,
got &s;uch great E&s;tates by their Frugality,
whil&s;t they were not addicted to &s;uch Pro|digality
and Wantonne&s;s as the Engli&s;h are,
who&s;e exce&s;s I cannot excu&s;e; neverthele&s;s,
the grave and &s;ober People of <HI>Holland</HI> are
<PB N="72" REF="41">
very &s;en&s;ible of the great alteration that now
is in their Country, and as they &s;ay, <HI>Para|cel&s;us</HI>
u&s;ed to Cure his Patients of their Di&s;|ea&s;e
with a full Belly; &s;o a good Burgher|ma&s;ter
de&s;irous to convince his Am&s;terdam|mers
of their di&s;&s;olute kind of Life, invited
the 36 Magi&s;trates and their Wives to a Fea&s;t;
who being come, and the Ladies big with
Expectation of &s;ome rare and extraordinary
Entertainment, &s;at down at Table, where
the fir&s;t Cour&s;e was Buttermilk boil'd with
Apples, Stock-fi&s;h, Butter'd Turnips and
Carrots, Lettice, Sallat, and Red Herrings,
and only &s;mall Bear, without any Wine;
at this the Ladies &s;tartled, and began to
whi&s;per to their Husbands, that they expe|cted
no &s;uch Entertainment, but upon re|moving
of the Di&s;hes and Plates, they found
underneath Printed Ver&s;es, importing, That
after that manner of living they began to
thrive, and had inlarged their City.</P>
<P>The Second Cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of Bocke de
kooks, Quarters of Lamb, Roa&s;ted Rabbits,
and a &s;ort of Pudding they call a <HI>Brother;</HI>
here they had <HI>Dort</HI> and Engli&s;h Beer, with
French Wine, yet all this did not plea&s;e the
Dainty Dames: But upon removing away
the Plates another Di&s;h of Poetry appeared,
which acquainted them, That after that mo|de&s;t
and &s;ober way of living they might keep
what they had got, and lay up &s;omething for
their Children.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="41">
Then comes in the Third Cour&s;e made
up of all the Rarities of the Sea&s;on, as Par|tridges,
Phea&s;ants, and all &s;orts of Fowl,
and Engli&s;h Pa&s;ties, with plenty of Rheni&s;h,
and other &s;orts of Wine, to moi&s;ten them;
this put the Ladies in a Frolick, and jolly
Humour, but under their Plates was found
the U&s;e and Application in Ver&s;es, telling
them, That to feed after that manner was
Voluptuous and Luxurious, and would impair
their Health, and wa&s;te their E&s;tates, make
them neglect their Trade, and &s;o in time re|duce
their &s;tately and new built flouri&s;hing
City to their old Fi&s;hing Town again. Af|ter
this was brought in a Banquet of all &s;orts
of Sweat Meats piled up in Pyramids, and
delicate Fruit, with plenty of delicious Wines;
and to conclude all, a &s;et of Mu&s;ick and
Maskers, who Danced with the young La|dies;
but at parting, like the hand writing
to <HI>Belte&s;hazzar</HI> upon the Wall, every one had
a Printed Paper of Moralities put into their
Hand, &s;hewing them the Cau&s;es of the Ruin
of the Roman Commonwealth, according
to that of the Poet,
<Q><L>Nullum crimen abe&s;t, facinu&s;que libidinis
ex quo,</L>
<L>Paupertas Romana perit.</L></Q>
with an excellent Advice to them, That if
they did not quit the Buffoonries, and Api&s;h
<PB N="74" REF="42">
Modes of the French, and return to the Sim|plicity,
Plainne&s;s and Mode&s;ty of their An|ce&s;tors
and Founders, their Commonwealth
could not long la&s;t; but all the Thanks the
good old Burgherma&s;ter had for his kind and
chargeable Entertainment in thus Fea&s;ting
his Country-Men, was to be Floutted at, and
Pasquild, the Sparks of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;aying in
all places, That the old Man being now pa&s;t
the years of Plea&s;ure him&s;elf, would have
none others to take theirs: And here I &s;hall
put a period to what I thought fit to ob&s;erve
of the States of the United Provinces, only I
will beg leave to &s;ay &s;omething to the Hol|lander
by way of Advice, <HI>viz.</HI> That now
they are in a pro&s;perous Condition, Rich,
and at Ea&s;e, they would look back and remem|ber
what God in his infinite Goodne&s;s and
Mercy did for them in the days of their
greate&s;t Calamities: For my own part I can|not
but admire the great Providence of God
in pre&s;erving them from being devoured by
their many Enemies they had in the la&s;t War,
be&s;ides their Enemies at home, &s;ome of which
particulars as they then happened give me
leave to relate. At the time when the French
came to Invade the Territories of the States
General, it then looked as if God had mark'd
out the way for the French to March, by
&s;ending &s;uch a wonderful dry Sea&s;on, that
the Rivers of the <HI>Rhine, Beta, Wall,</HI> and
other Rivers were Fordable, &s;o that the
<PB N="75" REF="42">
French only waded throw, and became &s;o
Victorious, that in a little &s;pace of time
(what by the Trea&s;ons of &s;ome, and the
Ignorance and Cowardi&s;e of others intru&s;ted
with the Militia and Gari&s;ons) the French
became Ma&s;ters of above Forty Cities and
Gari&s;ons, at which time there was nothing
to be heard of in the States Dominions but
Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery, even in the &s;trong
and rich City of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> it &s;elf, who at
this time beheld the French Army like a mighty
Torrent coming within &s;ight of the City,
and at the &s;ame time wanting Water in their
Canals, and Burghwalls to ply their Sluces,
and &s;uch was the &s;carcity of Rain, that a
Pail of fre&s;h Water was worth Six Pence:
Thus Heaven &s;eemed to frown on them, as
well as the French Army, by the &s;hutting
up as it were the Conduits of Heaven, and
yet a wor&s;e thing had like to have fallen
out, for at the &s;ame time the Divi&s;ions
grew &s;o high among&s;t the Magi&s;trates
in the Stadthou&s;e, that it was putting to
the Que&s;tion, Whether or no they &s;hould
not go and meet the French King with
the Keys of their City, to &s;ave it from Fire
and Plunder; now nothing, in all probabi|lity,
could &s;ave this rich City from falling
into the hands of the French, but an imme|diate
hand from Heaven, and it had un|doubtedly
come to pa&s;s, had not Providence
cau&s;ed the French to make a &s;tand at <HI>Muy|den,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="43">
two hours from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> at what
time the valiant Roman of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
Scout <HI>Ha&s;&s;elaer,</HI> like a true Father of his Coun|try,
oppo&s;ed the French Party in the Coun|&s;el,
calling out to the Burghers from the
Stadthou&s;e, to take Courage, and rather
chu&s;e to die, like old Battavians, with their
Swords in their hands, than tamely and
treacherou&s;ly to yield up their City to the
Mercy of the French, as &s;ome of the Ma|gi&s;trates
were about to do; this &s;o incoura|ged
the Burghers, that with great Courage
they mann'd the Walls, and Heaven then
a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with a &s;udden and plentiful
Rain, that they ply'd their Sluces, and
dround the Lands round the City three or
four Foot high, in &s;ome places, which caus'd
the victorious French Army to make a quick
retreat, as far as <HI>Utrecht,</HI> el&s;e they had paid
dear for &s;eeing of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> thus was
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> delivered by the hand of
Heaven.</P>
<P>A Second was, when that bloody Duke
of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who gloried and thanked
GOD that he was born without pity or re|mor&s;e
of Con&s;cience, took the opportunity
of an exceeding hard Fro&s;t, to march his
Army over the Ice as it had been dry ground,
burning in his way the three fair Villages of
<HI>Bodygrave, Swammerdam,</HI> and <HI>Goud&s;e-&s;luys;</HI>
acting there a more cruel Tragedy, and
wor&s;e, than ever did Turk, for they gene|rally
<PB N="77" REF="43">
&s;ave the Country People for Ran&s;om,
but this cruel Prince cau&s;ed &s;trong Guards
to &s;urround the Villages, and burnt Men,
Women, and Children together: Thus he
began his march, with a de&s;ign to burn <HI>Ley|den,
Hague, Rotterdam, Delft,</HI> and all the rich
Country of <HI>Rhineland:</HI> And this he might
have done in all probability, for, fir&s;t, the
Governor of <HI>New-&s;luce,</HI> who commanded
the Po&s;t that &s;hould have &s;topt the French,
treacherou&s;ly delivered up the Fort without
firing a Gun; and the handful of Troops
then under General <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> were &s;o in|con&s;iderable,
that they, joyned to the Sol|diers
under <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Vin,</HI> the Governor of
<HI>New-&s;luce,</HI> were not able to make head as
could oppo&s;e <HI>Laxemburg</HI>'s Army; and at the
&s;ame time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was with
the States Army at <HI>Charleroy:</HI> Now was <HI>Ley|den</HI>
ready to meet the French with the Keys
of their City, and other Cities too, for they
had neither Fortifications nor Soldiers to
man their Walls: Thus the whole Country
and Cities of <HI>Rhineland</HI> were like to fall un|der
the Cruelties and Tyrany of the French,
but GOD a &s;econd time &s;ent the&s;e People
Relief from Heaven, fir&s;t by giving &s;uch un|daunted
Courage to that Great States-man
Pen&s;ionary <HI>Fagel,</HI> that he forced <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI>
to rally his Troops together, and to make
a &s;tand near <HI>Leyden,</HI> offering him&s;elf to die
at the head of them if there were occa&s;ion,
<PB N="78" REF="44">
but GOD re&s;erved him for a further Good
to the Commonwealth, by &s;ending &s;uch a
&s;udden Thaw as was never &s;een before, for
in le&s;s than ten hours, the Ice &s;o &s;unk, and
&s;uch Floods of Snow came down from the
Highlands, that the French were fain to
make a very di&s;orderly retreat, marching up
to the middle for ha&s;te, becau&s;e on the Banks
there could not march above four Men
a-brea&s;t, &s;o they were con&s;trained to leave
behind them the greate&s;t part of the Plun|der
they had robb'd from the Innocent Coun|try
People, and the nimble Dutch-men, on
their Scates, &s;o long as the Ice would bear
them, did &s;hoot down the French like Ducks
diving under Water, &s;o that it co&s;t <HI>Luxem|burg</HI>'s
Army dear, though they had the
plea&s;ure to burn the poor People, of which
the French afterward wickedly made their
boa&s;t.</P>
<P>The third was as wonderful as the two
others; and although I do not believe Mira|cles,
as do the Papi&s;ts, yet I &s;ay nothing I
ever ob&s;erved looked more like a Miracle
than this; to wit, when the Engli&s;h and
French Fleet lay before <HI>Scheveling</HI> with a de|&s;ign
to land, and the French ready on their
March to joyn with the Engli&s;h and other
French as &s;oon as they &s;hould land, at the
&s;ame time the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> lying before
<HI>Groeningen,</HI> and the French before <HI>Gorcom,</HI> &s;o
that now all things looked with a dreadful
<PB N="79" REF="44">
face for the States, yet at this very time God
&s;ent a third relief, by &s;ending &s;uch Mi&s;ts,
and wonderful &s;orts of Tydes, as &s;o &s;epara|ted
the two Fleets, that the Engli&s;h were
forced to quit <HI>Scheveling</HI> Shore, and were
driven on the &s;ide of the <HI>Texel</HI> Road; from
whence they were con&s;trained by the &s;ea&s;on
of the Year to retire home: And &s;uch were
the &s;udden and great Showers of Rain, that
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> was forced in di&s;order
to rai&s;e his Siege at <HI>Groeningen,</HI> and the French
to quit <HI>Gorcom.</HI> I could add many more Ob|&s;ervations
of the Providences of God to the&s;e
People, as the pre&s;erving the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI>
His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
from the many treacherous De&s;igns contri|ved
again&s;t him from his Cradle; but <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>
mu&s;t be pre&s;erved, to go in and out before
his&punc; People. Certainly never young Prince
endured &s;o many Fatigues as did his High|ne&s;s
in his tender Years, of which I was an
Eye-witne&s;s; and had his Highne&s;s had the
Years and Experience, and &s;uch a good Di&s;|ciplined
Army (as now he hath) in the Year
1671. when the French entred the Coun|try,
his Highne&s;s had given them as good a
Welcom as he did at <HI>Bergen.</HI> I will &s;ay no
more of this Subject, only this, That the
Peace at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was al&s;o a very won|derful
thing, for that not above eight Days
before the Peace was &s;igned, mo&s;t of the
Plenipotentiaries did believe the War would
<PB N="80" REF="45">
have continued another Year; fir&s;t, becau&s;e
the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and Duke of <HI>Branden|burg</HI>
pro&s;pered exceedingly again&s;t <HI>Sweed|land,</HI>
and totally refu&s;ed the Propo&s;itions of
<HI>France;</HI> and &s;econdly, becau&s;e the French
King writ &s;uch bitter Letters again&s;t the
States-General: Yet eight Days after dre&s;t a
Letter unto the States, in which he calls
them his <HI>Good Friends, and Old Alleys,</HI> offer|ing
them not only <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> but every Foot
of Ground they could lay claim to in the
World; al&s;o giving them new Terms and
Conditions as to their Privileges in <HI>France,</HI>
by way of Trade. Neither can I forget how
&s;peedily and as &s;trangely the French King
did quit his Conquered Towns after the Va|liant
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> took <HI>Naerden,</HI> which
was the fir&s;t &s;tep to the French's Ruine in
the States Dominions. I come now, accor|ding
to promi&s;e in the beginning of this Book,
to give the Reader &s;ome Remarks I made
in other Countries where I have been, du|ring
my Sixteen Years Travels. To give
a full account of all that might be ob&s;erved
in &s;o many Countries, is not a Task for one
Man, nor a Subject for &s;o &s;mall a Book; I
&s;hall only therefore briefly take notice of
&s;ome remarkable Matters which may in &s;ome
mea&s;ure &s;atisfie the Curio&s;ity of my Country|men,
who have not been in the &s;aid places,
and convince, if po&s;&s;ible, all of them, that
no Country that ever I was in, affords &s;o
<PB N="81" REF="45">
great Conveniencies for the generality of
People to live in, as the Kingdom of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
doth. Though I have twice made the
<HI>grand tour</HI> of <HI>Germany, Hungary, Italy</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> and after my return back to <HI>England,</HI>
travelling a third time through <HI>Holland</HI> as far
as <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and &s;o back by <HI>Francfort</HI> to
<HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sueden;</HI> yet the Reader is not
to expect I &s;hould follow a Geographical
Method and Order in &s;peaking of the Places
I have been in; that is to be lookt for in the
Map, and not in Travels; but only that I
mention Places as I found them on my Road,
according as Bu&s;ine&s;s or Curio&s;ity led me to
Travel.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t con&s;iderable Place I then met
with, after I was out of the Dominions
of the States-General, was <HI>Cleave,</HI> the Capi|tal
City of the Province &s;o called; a fair and
lovely City &s;tanding upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and
the Rivers <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Leck.</HI> This Province
much re&s;embles <HI>England</HI> in rich Soil, and
plea&s;antne&s;s of its Rivers. The Inhabitants
of the Country would have me believe that
they were Originally de&s;cended of tho&s;e <HI>Sax|ons</HI>
who made a de&s;cent into <HI>England,</HI> and
conquered it; and to convince the truth of
this, they &s;hew'd me a Cloy&s;ter &s;tanding on
a Hill, called <HI>Eltham,</HI> from which they &s;ay
our <HI>Eltham</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> had its Name. I was
made to ob&s;erve al&s;o two places &s;tanding
<PB N="82" REF="46">
upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> near <HI>Emmerick,</HI> called <HI>Doad|ford,</HI>
and <HI>Gronewich,</HI> which according to
them, gave the Names to <HI>Dedford</HI> and <HI>Green|wich</HI>
in <HI>England:</HI> But many &s;uch Analogies
and Similitudes of Names are to be found in
other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> but e&s;pecially in up|per
<HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> The greate&s;t part
of this Province of <HI>Cleave,</HI> and part of the
Dutchies of <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Berg,</HI> and of the Pro|vinces
of <HI>Marke</HI> and <HI>Ravensbourg,</HI> belongs to
the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> the re&s;t belong|ing
to the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> now Elector
<HI>Palatine,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Cologne.</HI> The
Inhabitants are partly Roman Catholicks,
partly Lutherans, and partly Calvini&s;ts, who
all live promi&s;cuou&s;ly and peaceably toge|ther
both in City and Country. The City
of <HI>Cleave</HI> is the utmo&s;t Limit of the Territo|ries
of the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> on this
&s;ide of <HI>Germany;</HI> from whence his Electoral
Highne&s;s can Travel Two Hundred Dutch
Miles out-right in his own Dominions, and
never &s;leep out of his own Country but one
Night in the Territories of the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>O&s;nabrug.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Cleave</HI> I went to a &s;mall Town
called <HI>Rhinberg,</HI> but a very &s;trong For|tification
belonging to the Elector of <HI>Co|logne;</HI>
which lies at two Miles di&s;tance from
the City of <HI>We&s;el,</HI> that belongs to the Elector
of <HI>Brandenbourg.</HI> Through <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorpe,</HI> &s;ituated
<PB N="83" REF="46">
on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the Re&s;idence of the Duke
of <HI>Newbourg,</HI> I went next to <HI>Cologne,</HI> a very
large City, called by the Romans <HI>Colonia A|grippina,</HI>
and the French <HI>Rome d'Allemagne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cologne</HI> is an Imperial City, and a Repub|lick,
though for &s;ome things it does Homage
to the Elector of that Name, and receives
an Oath from him. It is much decayed with|in
the&s;e Hundred Years, having been much
Prie&s;t-ridden; a Misfortune that hath un|done
many other great Cities. The Je&s;uits
have had &s;o great Influence upon the Magi|&s;trates,
that they prevailed with them to ba|ni&s;h
all Prote&s;tants, who removed to <HI>Ham|bourg</HI>
and <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Cologne</HI> is be|come
&s;o di&s;peopled, that the Hou&s;es daily
fall to ruine for want of Inhabitants, and a
great deal of Corn and Wine now grows
within the Walls, upon Ground where Hou|&s;es
formerly &s;tood. I dare be bold to affirm,
that there is twice the Number of Inhabi|tants
in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martins in the Fields,</HI>
as there is in <HI>Cologne;</HI> and yet it contains
as many Pari&s;h-Churches, Mona&s;teries and
Chappels, as there are days in the Year. The
Streets are very large, and &s;o are the Hou|&s;es
al&s;o, in many of which one may drive a
Coach or Wagon into the fir&s;t Room from
the Streets: But the Streets are &s;o thin of
People, that one may pa&s;s &s;ome of them and
not meet Ten Men or Women, unle&s;s it be

Church-Men, or Religious Si&s;ters. The
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Inhabitants of the City are
Prote&s;tant Merchants, though but few in
Number, and they not allowed a Church
neither, but at a place called <HI>Woullin,</HI> a Mile
without the City; the re&s;t of the Inhabitants,
who are Lay-men, are mi&s;erably poor. There
are no le&s;s than 3000 Students in <HI>Cologne</HI>
taught by the Je&s;uits <HI>gratis,</HI> who have the
privilege to beg in Mu&s;ical Notes in the Day-time,
and take to them&s;elves the liberty of
borrowing Hats and Cloaks in the Night.
But if in the Je&s;uits Schools there be any Rich
Burgherma&s;ters Sons who have Parts, they
are &s;ure to be &s;napt up, and adopted into
the Society. Formerly, before the Matter
was otherwi&s;e adju&s;ted in the Dyet of <HI>Ratu|bonne,</HI>
there have been De&s;igns of Voting
Prote&s;tant Magi&s;trates into the Government
again; but &s;o &s;oon as the Je&s;uits came to di&s;|cover
who of the Magi&s;trates were for that,
they immediately preferred their Sons or
Daughters, and made them Canons, Abbots,
or Canone&s;&s;es, and &s;o diverted them by In|tere&s;t.
It's pity to &s;ee a City &s;o famous for
Traffick in former times, now brought to &s;o
great a decay, that were it not for the Trade of
Rheni&s;h-Wine, it would be utterly for&s;aken,
and left wholly to the Church-Men. The con|tinual
Alarms the Magi&s;trates have had by Fo|reign
De&s;igns upon their Liberty, and the Jea|lou&s;ies
fomented among them&s;elves, as it is
<PB N="85" REF="47">
thought, by the Agents and Favourers of
<HI>France,</HI> and e&s;pecially the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Stra&s;|bourg,</HI>

continual di&s;quiet, and nece&s;&s;itated them to
rai&s;e great Taxes, which hath not a little con|tributed
to the impoveri&s;hing of the People,
e&s;pecially the Boars round about; who, tho'
the Country they live in be one of the mo&s;t
plea&s;ant and fertile Plains of <HI>Germany,</HI> yet
are &s;o wretchedly poor, that Canvas Cloaths,
Wooden Shoes, and Straw to &s;leep on in
the &s;ame room with their Bea&s;ts, is the
greate&s;t worldly Happine&s;s that mo&s;t of them
can attain unto. The Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> is
Bi&s;hop of four great Bi&s;hopricks, <HI>viz. Co|logne,</HI>
Prince of <HI>Liege, Mun&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hel|der&s;hime.</HI>
To &s;peak of all the Miracles of the
three Kings of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and the va&s;t number
of Saints, who were removed out of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and interred there, would be but tedi|ous,
and perhaps incredible, to the Reader,
as well as wide of my de&s;ign: I &s;hall there|fore
proceed.</P>
<P>FRom <HI>Cologne</HI> I took Water on the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
and advanced to the City of <HI>Bon,</HI> and
&s;o forward to <HI>Coblentz,</HI> the Re&s;idence of the
Elector of <HI>Trier:</HI> Over-again&s;t this City, on
the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &s;tands that im|pregnable
Fort called <HI>Hermin&s;hine,</HI> built on a
high rocky Hill, as high again as <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>-Ca&s;tle;
and on the North-&s;ide of it, the Ri|ver
<PB N="86" REF="48">
<HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> falls into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over which
there is a &s;tately Stone-Bridge. This Prince
governs his Subjects as the other Spiritual
Electors do, that is, both by Temporal and
Spiritual Authority, which in that Country
is pretty ab&s;olute. The chief Trade of this
Country is in Wine, Corn, Wood and
Iron.</P>
<P>THE next Country I came to was that of
the Elector of <HI>Mayence</HI> or <HI>Mentz,</HI> who is
likewi&s;e both a Secular and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Prince, and governs his Subjects accordingly.
He is reckoned to be wholly for the Intere&s;ts
of the French King; who, notwith&s;tanding of
that, pretends a Title to the Cittadel of
<HI>Mayence.</HI> As I was upon my Journey to
<HI>Mayence</HI> by Land, I made a turn down the
<HI>Rhine</HI> to vi&s;it the famous little City of <HI>Back|rack,</HI>
and &s;ome Towns belonging to the
Landtgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> but e&s;pecially <HI>Backrack,</HI>
becau&s;e Travellers &s;ay, it much re&s;embles
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in its Situation and manner of
Buildings. The Burgherma&s;ter of this City
told me, that the whole Country about <HI>Back|rack</HI>
does not yield above 200 Fouders of
Wine a year; and yet the Merchants of <HI>Dort,</HI>
by an Art of Multiplication, which they
have u&s;ed &s;ome years, furni&s;h <HI>England</HI> with
&s;everal thou&s;and of Fouders. Here I &s;hall
take the Liberty to relate a &s;trange Story,
which, I found recorded in this Country, tho'
<PB N="87" REF="48">
I know it to be mentioned in Hi&s;tory:
There was a certain cruel and inhuman Bi|&s;hop
of <HI>Mayence,</HI> who, in a year of great
&s;carcity and Famine, when a great number
of poor People came to his Gates begging
for Bread, cau&s;ed the poor Wretches, Men,
Women, and Children, to be put into a
Barn, under pretext of relieving their Ne|ce&s;&s;ities,
but &s;o &s;oon as they were got in, cau&s;ed
the Barn Doors to be &s;hut, Fire &s;et to it,
and &s;o burnt them all alive: And whil'&s;t the
poor Wretches cried and &s;hrieked out for
Horror and Pain, the barbarous Mi&s;creant
&s;aid to tho&s;e that were about him, Hark,
how the Rats and Mice do cry. But the ju&s;t
Judgment of GOD &s;uffered not the Fact to
pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; for not long after the cruel
Bi&s;hop was &s;o haunted with Rats and Mice,
that all the Guards he kept about him could
not &s;ecure him from them, neither at Table
nor in Bed; at length he re&s;olved to flee for
Safety into a Tower that &s;tood in the middle
of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but the Rats pur&s;ued him&punc;
got into his Chamber, and devoured him
alive; &s;o that the Ju&s;tice of the Almighty
made him a Prey to Vermin, who had in|humanly
reckoned his Fellow-Chri&s;tians to
be &s;uch. The Tower, which I &s;aw, to this
day is call'd the Rats-Tower, and the Story
is upon Record in the City of <HI>Mayence.</HI></P>
<P>On my Journey from thence I came to
the little Village of <HI>Hockom,</HI> not far di&s;tant,
<PB N="88" REF="49">
famous for our Hockomore-Wine, of which,
though the place does not produce above 150
Fouders a year, yet the ingenious Hollanders
of <HI>Dort</HI> make &s;ome thou&s;and Fouders of it
go off in <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Hockom</HI> I proceeded to <HI>Francfort,</HI> a
plea&s;ant City upon the River of <HI>Maine,</HI>
called formerly <HI>Teutoburgum</HI> and <HI>Helenop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lis,</HI>
and &s;ince <HI>Francfort,</HI> becau&s;e here the Franco|nians,
who came out of the Province of
<HI>Franconia,</HI> foarded over, when they went
upon their Expedition into <HI>Gallia,</HI> which
they conquered, and named it <HI>France:</HI> And
I thought it might very well de&s;erve the
Name of <HI>Petty-London,</HI> becau&s;e of its Privi|leges,
and the Humour of the Citizens. It
is a Han&s;iatick and Imperial Town, and
Commonwealth, the Magi&s;trates being Lu|therans,
which is the publick e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|ligion;
though the Cathedral Church be|longs
to the Roman Catholicks, who al&s;o
have &s;everal Mona&s;teries there. The City
is populous, and frequented by all &s;orts of
Merchants, from mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> al&s;o, becau&s;e of the two great Fairs
that are yearly kept there: Many Jews live
in this City, and the riche&s;t Merchants are
Calvini&s;ts, who are not &s;uffered to have a
Church in the Town, but half an hours
Journey out of it, at a place called <HI>Bucknam,</HI>
where <HI>I</HI> have told Seventy four Coaches at a
<PB N="89" REF="49">
time, all belonging to Merchants of the
City. It was in ancient times much en|rich'd
by <HI>Charlemain,</HI> and hath been &s;ince
by the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Golden-Bull:</HI> A|mong&s;t
other Honours and Privileges, it's
appointed to be the place of the Emperor's
Election, where many of the Ornaments, be|longing
to that Augu&s;t Ceremony, are to
be &s;een. It is &s;trongly fortified, having a
&s;tately Stone-bridge over the <HI>Mayne,</HI> that
joyns it to <HI>Saxe-hou&s;en,</HI> the Quarter of the
Great Ma&s;ter of the Teutonick-Order. The
Government is ea&s;ie to the People, they not
being taxed as other Cities are; and had it
not been for the Alarms the French gave
them, during the la&s;t War, they had not
been much troubled, but being forced to
keep 3 or 4000 Men in con&s;tant Pay to de|fend
their Fortifications, the Magi&s;trates
were con&s;trained to rai&s;e Money by a Tax.
Be&s;ides that of the Emperor, they are under
the Protection of &s;ome Neighbouring Prin|ces,
as of the Landtgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el,</HI>
Landtgrave of <HI>Arm&s;tadt,</HI> the Count of <HI>Solmes,</HI>
and the Count of <HI>Hanau,</HI> who are either
Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts, among&s;t whom the
late Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was al&s;o one; but whe|ther
the pre&s;ent, who is a Roman Catho|lick,
be &s;o or not, I cannot tell. This
City takes great care of their Poor, and in
their Charity to poor Travellers exceed <HI>Hol|land:</HI>
I have &s;een a Li&s;t of Seven thou&s;and
<PB N="90" REF="50">
whom they relieved in one year. Their
great Ho&s;pital is a large Court or Palace, where
the Engli&s;h Merchants formerly lived, in the
time of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Per&s;ecution of the
Prote&s;tants, who, when they were recalled by
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were &s;o generous as to give
the whole Court, with all their Pack-hou&s;es
and Lands to the Poor of the City. It was
my fortune to be there in that cold Winter
in the year 1683, and &s;aw a Ceremony
performed by the Wine-Coopers of the City,
who are obliged by Law, that when ever
the <HI>Maine</HI> lies fa&s;t frozen over for 8 days toge|ther,
to make a great Fouder Fat, Hoops and
Staves, and &s;et it up compleat upon the Ice.
It was very good diver&s;ion to &s;ee &s;o many
Hands at Work, and to ob&s;erve the jollity
and mirth of the many Thou&s;ands of Spe|ctators,
who wanted not plenty of Rheni&s;h
Wine to Carou&s;e in.</P>
<P>I had the curio&s;ity afterward to go to the
Court of the Landtgrave of <HI>Arme&s;tadt,</HI> a
Lutheran Prince, who lives in part of the
riche&s;t Soil in <HI>Germany.</HI> His Highne&s;s is a
very courteous and obliging Prince to Stran|gers,
and his Subjects are in a pretty good
Condition again, though they have been great
Sufferers by the la&s;t War between the Landt|grave
of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> and this Family.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="50">
FRom thence I went to <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> a City
I had been formerly in, in the Life time
of that Wi&s;e, though unfortunate Prince
Elector, Elder Brother to Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI>
Here I had the Honour to pay my Dutiful
Re&s;pects to the Elector, the Son of that great
Prince, who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ary I had the Ho|nour
to be for two years together in <HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI>
This Prince, &s;ince my being there, is
Dead, and left behind him the Reputation
of having been a zealous thorough paced
Calvini&s;t, and &s;o con&s;tant a frequenter of the
Church, that &s;ome Sundays he went thrice
a day to Sermon; but never failed, if in
Health, to be once a day at lea&s;t at the Ga|ri&s;on
Church, where he took particular no|tice
of &s;uch Officers as were ab&s;ent. He was
Married to a mo&s;t Virtuous Lady, the Royal
Si&s;ter of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and his Bro|ther
Prince <HI>George.</HI> During his Life time the
Univer&s;ity of <HI>Heidleberg</HI> flouri&s;hed exceed|ingly,
&s;o that the number of Students was
&s;o great, that Chambers and Lodgings in the
City were &s;carce, and <HI>Spanhemius</HI> was about
quitting <HI>Leyden</HI> to return to his Profe&s;&s;ors
place in <HI>Heidleberg;</HI> but how matters &s;tand
&s;ince his Death, I am as yet ignorant. This
Country is called, the Paradi&s;e of <HI>Germany,</HI>
for its fruitfulne&s;s in Wine, Corn, and all
&s;orts of Fruit. I my &s;elf have &s;een growing
in one Plain, at the &s;ame time, Vines, Corn,
<PB N="92" REF="51">
Che&s;tnuts, Almonds, Dates, Figs, Cherries,
be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;orts of Fruit. And as
the Country is fertile in yielding the Fruits
of the Earth, &s;o the People are careful in
providing Store Room for them. This I
take notice of, becau&s;e of the prodigious
Rheni&s;h Wine Fats which are to be &s;een there,
among&s;t which there are Seven, the lea&s;t
whereof holds the quantity of 250 Barils of
Beer, as I calculated; but the large and mo&s;t
celebrated Fat is that which goes by the name
of the great Tun of <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> and holds 204
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Fouder contains 4 Hog&s;heads.</NOTE>Fouders of Wine, and co&s;t 705 <HI>l.</HI>
Sterling in Building, for which
one may have a very good Hou&s;e
built. This Fat I have &s;een twice,
and the fir&s;t time was, when the Elector
Treated the French Amba&s;&s;adors that came
to conclude the Match betwixt his Daugh|ter,
and Mon&s;ieur the French Kings Bro|ther,
who Married her after the Death of
<HI>Henrietta</HI> his fir&s;t Wife; at which Treat there
happened an adventure, that I &s;hall here
plea&s;e the Reader with. In a Gallery that
is over this Fat, the Elector cau&s;ed a Table
to be placed in the middle, exactly above the
Bunghole of this Mon&s;trous Ve&s;&s;el, and to be
covered with a co&s;tly Banquet of all &s;orts of
Sweat-Meats: The day before, all the Wine
being emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a little before the Amba&s;&s;adors, with
other Foreign Mini&s;ters and Per&s;ons of Qua|lity
mounted the Stairs to come to the place
<PB N="93" REF="51">
of Entertainment, the Elector cau&s;ed twelve
Drummers, with as many Trumpeters, &s;ome
Kettle-Drums, and other Mu&s;ick, to be lodged
in the Belly of the Tun, with orders to &s;trike
up, upon a &s;ignal given, when the Elector
drank the French Kings Health. All being
&s;at down at Table, and merrily Feeding,
the Elector drank the Health, and the Signal
was given; whereupon the Mu&s;ick began
to play its part, with &s;uch a roaring and un|couth
Noi&s;e out of that va&s;t Cavity below,
that the French and other Per&s;ons of Qua|lity
who were unacquainted with the de&s;ign,
looking upon it to be an infernal and omi|nous
Sound, in great a&s;toni&s;hment began to
cry out, <HI>Je&s;u Maria, The Worlds at an end,</HI>
and to &s;hift every one for him&s;elf in &s;o great
Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, that for ha&s;te to be
gone they tumbled down Stairs one over
another. All that the Elector could &s;ay to
compo&s;e them, was either not heard, or not
valued, nor could any thing &s;atisfie and re|a&s;&s;ure
them, till they &s;aw the Actors come
marching out of their Den. Had not many
Per&s;ons of Quality and Travellers &s;een this
Fat as well as my &s;elf, who know that what
I &s;ay of its incredible bigne&s;s to be true, I
&s;hould be afraid the Reader might think I
impo&s;ed upon his Credulity.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidleberg</HI> I went to &s;ee that im|pregnable
Fort or Cittadel of <HI>Manheim allas
Fredericksberg,</HI> built by the Elector <HI>Frederick,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="52">
Brother to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> a Prince of as
good a Head as any <HI>Germany</HI> afforded; who
though &s;ome have too partially judged of
him by his Misfortunes, yet by the wi&s;e&s;t of
the Age was accounted the <HI>Cato</HI> of <HI>Germany.</HI>
The Wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Men of the World have
been unfortunate, which makes &s;ome to be
of the Opinion, That God in his Wi&s;dom
thinks fit it &s;hould be &s;o, le&s;t otherwi&s;e they
might attribute their Pro&s;perity rather to the
wi&s;e direction of their own Conduct, than
his All-&s;eeing Providence: And indeed, daily
Experience &s;eems to evince the Truth of this,
&s;ince we &s;ee Knaves and Fools advanced to
Preferment and Riches, when Men of Virtue
and Parts die neglected, and poor in the
Eyes of the World, though rich in the en|joyment
of a contented Mind. But this is a
digre&s;&s;ion which the Honour I have for the
memory of that great Man hath led me into,
and therefore I hope will be pardoned by
the Reader. In the Cittadel of <HI>Manheim</HI> I
&s;aw &s;ome of the Records of that Illu&s;trious
Family, which without di&s;pute is the mo&s;t
ancient of all the Secular Electors, being El|der
to that of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which &s;prung from
one and the &s;ame Stock; to wit, two Em|perors
of <HI>Germany.</HI> Many Writers derive
them originally from <HI>Charlemain,</HI> by the
Line of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France.</HI> There have
been &s;everal Emperors of that Race, one
King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and four Kings of <HI>Sueden,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="52">
one of which was King of <HI>Norway</HI> al&s;o, be|&s;ides
many great Generals of Armies in <HI>Ger|many,
Hungary, France,</HI> and other Countrys.
Since I can remember there were five Pro|te&s;tant
Princes Heirs to that Electoral Dig|nity
alive; which now by their Death is
fallen to the Duke of <HI>Newbourg,</HI> the pre&s;ent
Prince Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> a Roman Catholick,
who&s;e Daughter is Empre&s;s of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
another of his Daughters Married to the
King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> a third to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and a fourth to Prince <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BEing &s;o near <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> I had the curi|o&s;ity
to go &s;ee what figure that Famous
City now made, &s;ince it had changed its
Ma&s;ter; for I had been thrice there before,
when it flouri&s;hed under the Emperors Pro|tection,
with the liberty of a Han&s;iatick
Town: And indeed, I found it &s;o disfigured,
that had it not been for the &s;tately Cathedral
Church, and fair Streets, and Buildings, I
could &s;carcely have known it. In the Streets
and Exchange, which formerly were throng|ed
with &s;ober, rich, and peaceable Merchants,
you meet with none hardly now but Men
in Buff-Coats and Scarffs, with rabbles of
Soldiers their Attendants. The Churches I
confe&s;s are gayer, but not &s;o much frequented
by the Inhabitants as heretofore, &s;eeing the
Lutherans are thru&s;t into the meane&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="53">
Churches, and mo&s;t of the chief Merchants,
both Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts, removed to
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hambourg.</HI> Within a few years,
I beleive it will be ju&s;t &s;uch another City for
Trade and Riches as <HI>Bri&s;ac</HI> is. It was for|merly
a rich City, and well &s;tockt with Mer|chants
and wealthy Inhabitants, who lived
under a gentle and ea&s;ie Government; but
now the Magi&s;trates have little el&s;e to do in
the Government, but only to take their
Rules and Mea&s;ures from a Cittadel and
great Guns, which are Edicts that Merchants
lea&s;t under&s;tand. I confe&s;s, <HI>Strasbourg</HI> is the
le&s;s to be pittied that it &s;o tamely became a
Slave, and put on its Chains without any
&s;trugling. Tho&s;e Magi&s;trates who were In|&s;truments
in it, are now &s;en&s;ible of their own
Folly, and bite their Nails for Anger, finding
them&s;elves no better, but rather wor&s;e hated
than the other Magi&s;trates, who did what
they could to hinder the Reception of their
new Ma&s;ters the French. I quickly grew
weary of being here, meeting with nothing
but complaints of Poverty, and paying ex|orbitant
Taxes.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;oon returned to my <HI>Petty-London,
Francfort,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Ca&s;|&s;el,</HI>
the chief Re&s;idence of the Landtgrave
of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI> This Prince is a Calvini&s;t, as mo&s;t
of his Subjects are, very grave and zealous
in his Religion: He Married a Prince&s;s of
<PB N="97" REF="53">
<HI>Courland,</HI> by whom he hath an hopeful I&s;&s;ue;
to wit, three Sons, and two Daughters.
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was God-Father to one of
his Sons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> was Chri&s;tened by the Name
of <HI>Charles;</HI> Captain <HI>William Legg,</HI> Brother to
the Lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> repre&s;enting his Ma|je&s;ty
as his Envoy. The Court of this Prince
does indeed re&s;emble a well-governed Col|lege,
or Religious Cloi&s;ter, in regard of its
Mode&s;ty and Regularity in all Things, and
e&s;pecially in the Hours of Devotion. He is
Rich in Money, and entertains about Nine
Thou&s;and Men in con&s;tant Pay, under the
Command of Count <HI>Vanderlip,</HI> a brave and
expert Soldier, his Lieutenant General, but
can bring many more upon occa&s;ion into
Field. This Family hath been very happy
both in its Progeny and Alliances, many
Wi&s;e Princes of both Sexes having &s;prung
from it; and the Mother of this pre&s;ent
Landtgrave may be reckoned among&s;t the
Illu&s;trious Women of the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t
Ages. After the Death of <HI>William</HI> V. Landt|grave
of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> her Husband, &s;he not only
&s;upported, but advanced the War wherein
he was engaged, did many &s;ignal Actions,
enlarged her Territories, and at the conclu|&s;ion
of the Peace, kept under her Pay 56
Cornets of Hor&s;e in five Regiments, 166
Companies of Foot, be&s;ides 13 Companies
of Dragoons, and 14 Independent Compa|nies,
in all 249 Companies of Hor&s;e and
<PB N="98" REF="54">
Foot: She was a Prince&s;s extreamly obliging
to Strangers, e&s;pecially virtuous and learned
Divines. I had the Honour a good many
years ago to ki&s;s her Highne&s;&s;es Hand, at
which time &s;he was mighty Zealous in pro|moting
an Accommodation among&s;t diffe|rent
Religions, as the Roman Catholick,
Lutheran and Calvini&s;t, but e&s;pecially be|twixt
the two latter; and therefore enter|tained
Doctor <HI>Duris,</HI> at her Court in <HI>Ca&s;&s;els,</HI>
who wrote &s;everal pieces upon that Subject
of Reconciliation, and with &s;ome of his Friends
had a Conference with a Learned Prie&s;t,
that came from <HI>Rome</HI> to forward the Project;
whereupon the Doctor Publi&s;hed his Book of
the <HI>Harmony of Con&s;ent,</HI> which is highly
e&s;teemed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>FRom this Princes Court I directed my
Journey to <HI>Hanouer,</HI> taking <HI>Lamb&s;pring</HI>
in my way, a place where there is a Con|vent
of Engli&s;h Monks; and there I met
with a very aged, worthy, and harmle&s;s
Gentleman, Sir <HI>Thomas Ga&s;coigne,</HI> a Per&s;on of
&s;eeming great Integrity and Piety; the Lord
Abbot and &s;everal of the Monks I had &s;een
there formerly. This Mona&s;tery is very ob|liging
to all Strangers that Travel that way,
as well as to their own Country-men, and is
highly re&s;pected by the Neighbouring Princes
of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, as the Princes of the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> the Landtgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and
<PB N="99" REF="54">
Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who as Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hil|der&s;heim</HI>
is their Ordinary. The Town of
<HI>Lamb&s;pring</HI> is Lutheran, though under the
Government of the Lord Abbot and his
Chapter, who con&s;tantly chu&s;e Lutheran
Magi&s;trates and Officers for the Civil Ad|mini&s;tration,
and live together in that Love
and Unity, that as yet there hath never the
lea&s;t debate happened among&s;t them; and
indeed, this Harmony is now to be ob&s;erved
in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where different
Religions are profe&s;&s;ed. When I con&s;idered
&s;o many goodly Faces, both of Monks and
Students in that Abbey, I could not forbear
to make a &s;erious Reflection on the number
of the Engli&s;h whom I had &s;een in the Col|leges
and Cloi&s;ters abroad, as at <HI>Rome, Rati&s;|bonne,
Wirtzburg</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> at <HI>Liege, Lou|vain,
Bru&s;&s;els, Dunkirk, Ghent, Paris,</HI> and
other places, be&s;ides the Nunneries; and
withall, on the lo&s;s that both King and King|dom
&s;uffered thereby, when &s;o many of our
Natives, both Men and Women &s;hould be
con&s;trained to &s;pend their own E&s;tates, and
the Benevolence of others in a &s;trange Land,
which amounts to more Money than at fir&s;t
one may imagine; and this thought, I con|fe&s;s,
made me wi&s;h it were otherwi&s;e. I
would not have the Reader to mi&s;take me
here, as if I E&s;pou&s;ed, or Pleaded for any
particular Party; no, I plead only for the
Sentiments of Humanity, without which
<PB N="100" REF="55">
our Nature degenerates into that of Brutes,
and for the love that every hone&s;t Man
ought to have for his Country. I am as
much a Friend to the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition,
as to the per&s;ecuting of tender Con&s;cien|ced
Prote&s;tants, provided there be no more
but Con&s;cience in the Ca&s;e: And I could
heartily wi&s;h that Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants
could live as lovingly together in <HI>England,</HI>
as they do in <HI>Holland, Germany,</HI> and other
Countries; for give me leave to &s;ay it, I
love not that Religion, which in &s;tead of
Exalting, de&s;troys the Principles of Mora|lity
and human Society. I have met with
hone&s;t Men of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, even Turks
and Jews, who in their Lives and Manners
have far exceeded many of our Enthu&s;ia|&s;tick
Profe&s;&s;ors at home; and when ever
this happened, I could not forbear to love
the Men without embracing their Religion,
for which they them&s;elves are to account to
their great Ma&s;ter and Judge.</P>
<P>In my progre&s;s towards <HI>Hanouer</HI> I
touched at <HI>Hilder&s;heim,</HI> a City who&s;e Ma|gi&s;trates
are Lutheran, though Roman
Catholicks have the Cathedral Church,
and &s;everal Mona&s;teries there. The Court
of <HI>Hanouer</HI> makes another kind of Figure
than that of <HI>Ca&s;&s;els,</HI> it being the Court of
a great Prince, who is Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;naburg,</HI>
Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick, Lunenburg, Hanouer,
&amp;c.</HI> Here I had the Honour to Ki&s;s the
<PB N="101" REF="55">
Hands of the Prince&s;s Royal <HI>Sophia,</HI> young|e&s;t
Si&s;ter to the late Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> Her
Highne&s;s has the Character of the <HI>Merry
Debonnaire</HI> Prince&s;s of <HI>Germany,</HI> a Lady of
Extraordinary Virtue and Accompli&s;hments,
and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Italian, French, High and
Low Dutch, and Engli&s;h Languages,
which &s;he &s;peaks to Perfection. Her Hus|band
has the Title of the Gentleman of
<HI>Germany,</HI> a graceful and comely Prince
both a Foot, and on Hor&s;eback, Civil to
Strangers beyond compare, infinitely Kind
and Beneficent to People in Di&s;tre&s;s, and
known in the World for a Valiant and
Experienced Soldier. I had the Honour
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> his Troops, which, without Contro|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters">
are as good Men, and Commanded
by as expert Officers as any are in <HI>Europe:</HI>
Among&s;t his Officers I found brave <HI>Steel-Hand
Gordon,</HI> Colonel of an excellent Re|giment
of Hor&s;e, <HI>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot,</HI>
and others of our Kings Subjects. God hath
ble&s;t the Prince with a numerous Off-&s;pring,
having &s;ix Sons, all gallant Princes; of
whom the two Elde&s;t &s;ignalized them&s;elves
&s;o bravely at the rai&s;ing of the Siege of
<HI>Vienna,</HI> that as undoubted proof of their
Valour, they brought three Turks home to
this Court Pri&s;oners. His elde&s;t Son is
Married to a mo&s;t beautiful Prince&s;s, &s;ole
Heire&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> and <HI>Zell</HI>'s
Elder Brother; as the lovely Prince&s;s his
<PB N="102" REF="56">
Daughter is Married to the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburg.</HI> He is a gracious Prince to
his People, and keeps a very &s;plendid Court,
having in his Stables for the u&s;e of him&s;elf
and Children, no le&s;s than Fifty two &s;ets of
Coach-Hor&s;es: He him&s;elf is a Lutheran,
but as his Subjects are Chri&s;tians of different
Per&s;wa&s;ions, and &s;ome of them Jews too, &s;o
both in his Court and Army he entertains
Gentlemen of various Opinions and Coun|tries,
as Italian Abbots, and Gentlemen that
&s;erve him, and many Calvini&s;t French
Officers: Neither is he &s;o Bigotted in his
Religion, but that he and his Children go
many times to Church with the Prince&s;s,
who is a Calvini&s;t, and join with her in her
Devotion. His Country is good, having
Gold and Silver Mines in it, and his Sub|jects
live well under him; as do tho&s;e al&s;o
of his Brother the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> and
their Cozen the Duke of <HI>Wolfembuttel,</HI> which
are the three Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lunen|bourg;</HI>
of whom it may be &s;aid, that they
have always &s;tuck hone&s;tly to the right &s;ide,
and befriended the Intere&s;ts of the Empire;
&s;o that no by-Re&s;pect, neither Honour nor
Profit, could ever prevail with them, as it
has with others, to make them abandon the
publick Concern.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="56">
FRom this Princes Court I went to <HI>Zell,</HI> the
Re&s;idence of the Duke the elder Brother
of the Family. This Prince is called the
Mighty <HI>Nimrod,</HI> becau&s;e of the great delight
he takes in Hor&s;es, Dogs, and Hunting. He
did me the honour to let me &s;ee his Stables,
wherein he keeps 370 Hor&s;es, mo&s;t of them
Engli&s;h, or of Engli&s;h Breed. His Dogs,
which are al&s;o Engli&s;h, are &s;o many, that
with great care they are quartered in &s;everal
Apartments according to their Kind and
Qualities, there being a large Office like a
Brewhou&s;e employed for boyling of Malt
and Corn for them. It is this valiant Prince
who took <HI>Trieves</HI> from the French, and made
the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi</HI> Pri&s;oner: He is ex|treamly
obliging to Strangers, and hath &s;eve|ral
brave Scoti&s;h Officers under his Pay, as
Major-General <HI>Erskin, Graham, Coleman, Ha|milton,
Melvin,</HI> and others. His Lieutenant-General
is one <HI>Chavot</HI> a Prote&s;tant of <HI>Al&s;a|tia,</HI>
an excellent and experienced Comman|der.
I &s;hall add no more concerning this
Prince, his Officers, or Country; but that
he, with the other two Princes of the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Lunenbourg, Hanouer,</HI> and <HI>Wolfembuttel,</HI>
can upon occa&s;ion bring into the Field 36000
Soldiers, whom they keep in con&s;tant Pay,
and &s;uch Men as I never &s;aw better in my
life.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="57">
AFter &s;ome &s;tay at the Court of the Duke
of <HI>Zell,</HI> I went to <HI>Hambourg,</HI> a famous
Han&s;iatick Town. It is a Republick, and City
of great Trade, occa&s;ioned partly by the
Engli&s;h Company of <HI>Merchant Adventurers,</HI>
but much more by the Dutch Prote&s;tants,
who in the time of the Duke of <HI>Alba</HI> for|&s;ook
the Low-Countries and &s;ettled here, and
the Prote&s;tants al&s;o who were turned out of
<HI>Cologne,</HI> and other Places in <HI>Germany;</HI> who
neverthele&s;s are not now allowed Publick
Churches within the City, but at a place called
<HI>Altena,</HI> a Village belonging to the King of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
a quarter of an hours walk di&s;tant from
<HI>Hambourg.</HI> This Commonwealth is <HI>Luthe|ran,</HI>
and governed by 4 Burgherma&s;ters, 24
Radts-heers, and a Common-Council of all
the Burghers who have above 40 Shillings
<HI>per Annum</HI> Freehold. The Symbol or Motto
under their Arms, is, <HI>Da Pacem Domine in
Diebus no&s;tris;</HI> and in their Standards are
the&s;e Letters <HI>S. P. Q. H.</HI> The People here
groan under heavy Taxes and Impo&s;itions;
The State, becau&s;e of continual Alarms they
have from the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> or other
Neighbours; and the Inte&s;tine Broils that
frequently happen here, as well as at <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gne,</HI>
where the Burgherma&s;ters are often in dan|ger
of their Lives from the mutinous Mo|bile;
being forced to maintain 6 or 7000
Men in Pay, be&s;ides 2 or 3 Men of War to
<PB N="105" REF="57">
guard their Havens from Pirats. I &s;hall not
name all the ways of impo&s;ing Taxes which
this Commonwealth u&s;es, becau&s;e in mo&s;t
they imitate the Methods of the States-Ge|neral
as to that, which have been mentioned
before: I &s;hall only take notice of &s;ome pe|culiar
Cu&s;toms they have, wherein they
differ from <HI>Holland.</HI> When a Barber, Shoe|maker,
or any other Artizan dies, leaving
a Widow and Children, another of the
&s;ame Trade is not admitted to &s;et up for
him&s;elf as a Ma&s;ter, unle&s;s he compound
with the Widow for a piece of Money, or
el&s;e marry her, or a Daughter of hers with
her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>If any Man cau&s;e another to be Arre&s;ted
for Debt, or upon any other Suit, the
Plaintiff mu&s;t go along with the Officer who
Arre&s;ts the Party, and &s;tay by him until
the Pri&s;oner be examined by the Sheriff;
&s;o that if the Sheriff be not to be &s;poken
with that night, the Plaintiff mu&s;t tarry
with the Pri&s;oner all night, until the Sheriff
examin the matter, and &s;ee cau&s;e of di&s;|charging
or committing the Party; but
this a Plaintiff may do by a Procuration
Notarial.</P>
<P>If a Pri&s;oner be committed for Debt, the
Plaintiff mu&s;t maintain him in Pri&s;on ac|cording
to his Quality; and if the Party
lie in Pri&s;on during the &s;pace of 6 Years, at
the expiration of that time the Pri&s;oner is
<PB N="106" REF="58">
di&s;charged; and if during the time of his
Impri&s;onment the Plaintiff do not punctu|ally
pay the Pri&s;oner's Allowance at the
Months end, the Pri&s;oner is &s;et at liberty,
and neverthele&s;s the Plaintiff mu&s;t pay the
Gaoler the la&s;t Month's Allowance.</P>
<P>This State is &s;evere in the execution of
Ju&s;tice again&s;t Thieves, Murderers, and
Cheats. There is no Pardon to be expe|cted
for Murder, and a Burgherma&s;ter him|&s;elf,
if Guilty, cannot e&s;cape. The Pu|ni&s;hment
for Murder is here as in <HI>Sweden,</HI>
breaking Malefactors on the Wheel, pinching
their Brea&s;ts and Arms with hot Pincers,
&s;pitting them in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulder: They have al&s;o cruel ways
of Torturing to make Pri&s;oners confe&s;s;
and are very careful not to be cheated in
their Publick Revenue, their Exci&s;e-men
and Collectors being Puni&s;hed as in <HI>Holland.</HI>
They take a very good cour&s;e not to be
cheated in their Exci&s;e, for all the Mills of
the Country are in the hands of the State;
&s;o that no Baker nor Brewer can grind his
own Corn, but mu&s;t have it ground at the
States Mills, where they pay the Exci&s;e.
There is a General Tax upon all Hou&s;es,
and that is the Eighth Penny, which never|thele&s;s
does not excu&s;e them from Chimney-money.
The States here, as at <HI>Genoua</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> are the Publick Vintners, of whom
all People mu&s;t buy their Wine, which
<PB N="107" REF="58">
they buy from the Merchant, or otherwi&s;e
import it in their own Ships. In their Ce|remonies
of Burying and Chri&s;tening, they
are ridiculou&s;ly Prodigal; as for In&s;tance: If
one invite a Burgherma&s;ter, he mu&s;t give
him a Ducat in Gold; if a Radts-heer, that
is, an Alderman, a Rixdollar; to every
Preacher, Doctor of Phy&s;ick, Advocate or
Secretary, half a Rixdollar; and to every
Schoolma&s;ter, the third part of a Rixdollar.
The Women are the Inviters to Burials,
Weddings, and Chri&s;tenings, who wear an
Antick kind of a Dre&s;s, having Mitred Caps
as high again as the Mitre of a Bi&s;hop.
The Churches here are rich in Revenues
and Ornaments, as Images and &s;tately Or|gans,
wherein they much delight. They
are great Lovers of <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> in&s;omuch that I
have told 75 Ma&s;ters of &s;everal &s;orts of Mu|&s;ick
in one Church, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were
in the Organ-Gallery. Their Organs are
extraordinary large: I mea&s;ured the great
Pipes in the Organs of St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s and
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Churches, and found them to be
3 Foot and 3 quarters in circumference, and
32 Foot long; in each of which Organs
there are two Pipes 5 Foot and 8 Inches
round. The Wealth and Trade of this
City encrea&s;es daily; they &s;end one Year
with another 70 Ships to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and
have wonderfully Engro&s;&s;ed that Trade
from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and it's believed,
<PB N="108" REF="59">
that &s;mall and great there are belonging to
this Commonwealth five thou&s;and Sail of
Ships. After <HI>Am&s;terdam, Genoua</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI>
their Bank is reckoned the chief in Credit;
but in Trade they are accounted the third in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and come next to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Am|&s;terdam.
Hambourg</HI> is now become the Ma|gazine
of <HI>Germany,</HI> and of the Baltick and
Northern Seas. They give great Privileges
to the Jews, and to all Strangers what&s;oever,
e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h Company of Merchant
Adventurers, whom they allow a large Build|ing,
where they have a Church, and where
the Deputy-Governour, Secretary, Mini&s;ter,
and the other Officers of the Company live,
to whom they yearly make Pre&s;ents of Wine,
Beer, Sheep, Salmond and Sturgeon in their
&s;ea&s;ons. And &s;o much of <HI>Hambourg.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Hambourg</HI> I went to <HI>Lubeck,</HI> which
is al&s;o a Commonwealth and Imperial
Town. It is a large well-built City, con|taining
ten Pari&s;h-Churches; the Cathedral
dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> being in length 500
Foot, with two high Spires all covered with
Bra&s;s, as the re&s;t of the Churches of that Ci|ty
are. In former times this City was the
place where the Deputies of all the Han&s;ia|tick
Towns a&s;&s;embled, and was once &s;o
powerful as to make War again&s;t <HI>Denmark</HI>
and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to conquer &s;everal places
and I&s;lands belonging to tho&s;e two Crowns,
<PB N="109" REF="59">
nay and to lend Ships to <HI>England</HI> and other
Potentates, without any prejudice to their
own Trade, wherein they vyed in all parts
with their Neighbours; but it is now ex|ceedingly
run into decay, not only in Ter|ritories,
but in Wealth and Trade al&s;o. And
the rea&s;on of that was chiefly the Incon&s;ide|rate
Zeal of their Lutheran Mini&s;ters, who
per&s;waded the Magi&s;trates to bani&s;h all Ro|man
Catholicks, Calvini&s;ts, Jews, and all
that di&s;&s;ented from them in matter of Reli|gion,
even the Engli&s;h Company too, who
all went and &s;etled in <HI>Hambourg,</HI> to the great
Advantage of that City, and almo&s;t ruine of
<HI>Lubeck,</HI> which hath not now above 200 Ships
belonging to it, nor more Territories to the
State than the City it &s;elf, and a &s;mall part
called <HI>Termond,</HI> about eight Miles di&s;tant from
it. The re&s;t of their Territories are now in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Danes and Swedes, by
whom the Burghers are &s;o continually alarm|ed,
that they are quite tired out with keep|ing
Guard, and paying of Taxes. The Ci|ty
is indeed well fortified; but the Govern|ment
not being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Burghers in two Com|panies
are obliged to watch every Day. They
have a large well-built Stadthou&s;e, and an
Exchange covered, on the top whereof the
Globes of the World are painted. This Ex|change
is about 50 Yards in the length, and
but 15 in breadth: Over it there is a Room
<PB N="110" REF="60">
where the Skins of five Lyons which the
Burghers killed at the City-Gates in the Year
1252. are kept &s;tuft. The great Market-place
is very large, where a Monumental-Stone
is to be &s;een, on which one of their
Burgherma&s;ters was beheaded for running
away without fighting in a Sea-Engagement.
The People here &s;pend much time in their
Churches at Devotion, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly
in Singing. The Women are beautiful, but
disfigured with a kind of Antick Dre&s;s, they
wearing Cloaks like Men. It is cheap living
in this Town: For one may hire a Palace
for a matter of 20 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and have Pro|vi&s;ions
at very rea&s;onable Rates; be&s;ides the
Air and Water is very good, the City being
&s;upplied with Fountains of Excellent Fre&s;h
Water, which <HI>Hambourg</HI> wants; and good
Ground for Celleridge, there being Cellars
here 40 or 50 Foot deep.</P>
<P>I Had the Curio&s;ity to go from <HI>Lubeck</HI> to
&s;ee the Ancient City of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> but
found it &s;o ruined and decayed by the Swe|di&s;h
War, that I had no Encouragement to
&s;tay there. I therefore ha&s;tened to <HI>Berlin,</HI>
the chief Re&s;idence of the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburg;</HI>
at who&s;e Court I met with a very
Ingenuous French Merchant, who told me,
that he, and divers other Merchants, were
de&s;igned to have lived in <HI>England,</HI> but were
di&s;couraged by a Letter &s;ent from <HI>London,</HI> by
<PB N="111" REF="60">
a French-Man that was removing from thence
to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons,
which I Copied out of his Letter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the Reformed Religion is
per&s;ecuted in <HI>England</HI> as it is <HI>France;</HI> the
which I told him was a great Untruth, for
it is apparent that they have been all along
graciou&s;ly admitted, and received into his
Maje&s;ties Dominions, without interruption,
and allowed the free Exerci&s;e of their own
Form of Wor&s;hip, according to the Doctrine
and Di&s;cipline of the Churches of <HI>France.</HI>
Nor can they who conver&s;e with the French
Mini&s;ters either in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> be igno|rant,
that the chiefe&s;t part, if not all tho&s;e
Mini&s;ters, are willing to comply with the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> and it is evident that
mo&s;t of the Dutch and French Prote&s;tants
(&s;o called) in <HI>Holland</HI> make u&s;e of Organs in
their Churches.</P>
<P>A &s;econd thing was, that both the Bank
at <HI>London</HI> and the Bankers Gold&s;miths were
all broak; the which I told this Frenchman
was not true altogether, for there are many
able Bankers whom I named: Neither was
the Bank (as he called the Chamber of <HI>Lon|don)</HI>
broak, only it had been under the ma|nagement
of a bad Per&s;on, who&s;e de&s;ign was
to bring it into di&s;grace. Be&s;ides, there is
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company</HI> an unque&s;tionable Se|curity
for tho&s;e as have Money to di&s;po&s;e of,
together with another undeniable Security
which is Land.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="61">
Thirdly, he &s;aith, That in <HI>England</HI> there
is no Regi&s;ter, and therefore many Frauds
in Purcha&s;es and Morgages, which beget
tedious Suits, and renders both dangerous
to tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That if a Man would purcha&s;e
Land he cannot, being an Alien, until Na|turalized.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That in <HI>England</HI> there are &s;o ma|ny
Plots and Confu&s;ions in Government,
that the Kingdom is hardly quiet 20 Years
together.</P>
<P>Sixthly, that fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es were &s;o com|mon
in <HI>England,</HI> and the Crime of Perjury
&s;o &s;lightly puni&s;hed, that no Man could be
&s;afe in Life or E&s;tate, if he chanced to be
in Trouble.</P>
<P>La&s;tly he &s;aid, that the Engli&s;h are &s;o re&s;t|le&s;s
and quarel&s;om, that they not only fo|ment
and cheri&s;h Animo&s;ities among&s;t one
another, but are every foot contriving and
plotting again&s;t their Lawful Sovereign, and
the Government. By &s;uch Surmi&s;es and In|&s;inuations
as the&s;e, the French and Germans
are &s;cared from tru&s;ting them&s;elves and For|tunes
in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore &s;ettle in <HI>Am|&s;terdam,
Hamburgh,</HI> and other Cities, where
there are Banks and Regi&s;ters: This I &s;ay is
one cau&s;e, why there are now to be &s;een at
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;uch va&s;t numbers of French and
Germans, who have much enrich'd that
City, and rai&s;ed the Rents of the Hou&s;es 20
<PB N="113" REF="61">
<HI>per Cent.</HI> And the Silk-weavers grow al&s;o ve|ry
rich, keeping &s;o many Alms-Children to
do their Work, and having all their Labour
without any Charge, only for the teaching
them their Trades; which hath le&s;&s;ened the
Revenues of the French Crown, and will,
in time, greatly increa&s;e the number of the
States Subjects, and advance their publick
Incomes.</P>
<P>Having made this Digre&s;&s;ion, I return to
<HI>Berlin;</HI> It is a City enlarged with fair Streets
and Palaces: The Magi&s;trates of the place
are Lutherans, which is the publick e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
Religion in all the Electors Dominions;
though he him&s;elf and his Children be Cal|vini&s;ts:
He is look'd upon to be &s;o true to
that Per&s;ua&s;ion, that he is reckoned the Pro|tector
of the Calvini&s;ts; and indeed he &s;ol|licited
the Emperor very hard for a Tolera|tion
of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Hungary.</HI> His
Chaplains, as mo&s;t of the Lutheran Mini|&s;ters
al&s;o, endeavour to imitate the Engli&s;h
in their way of Preaching: And his High|ne&s;s
is &s;o much taken with Engli&s;h Divinity,
that he entertains Divines for tran&s;lating En|gli&s;h
Books into the German Tongue, as
<HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> and &s;everal others.
He has a large and &s;tately Palace at <HI>Berlin,</HI>
and therein a copious Library, enriched with
many Manu&s;cripts, Medals, and Rarities of
Antiquity. He may compare with mo&s;t
Princes for hand&s;om Guards, being all of
<PB N="114" REF="62">
them proper well-bodied Men, and mo&s;t
part Officers who ride in his Guards of
Hor&s;e. As he is known in the World to be
a Valiant and Warlike Prince, &s;o he main|tains
in Pay an Army of 36000 Men; be|&s;ides
five or &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;emen, who in
time of War are modelled into Troops;
with which Body during the late War with
<HI>Sweden,</HI> his Highne&s;s's Father in Per&s;on beat
the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of his Country. He keeps
his Forces in &s;trict Di&s;cipline, obliging all
the Officers, if Prote&s;tants, on <HI>Sundays</HI> and
Holy-days to march their &s;everal Companies
in order to Church; but if a Superiour Of|ficer
be of a contrary Per&s;wa&s;ion, then the
next in Commi&s;&s;ion &s;upplies his place. This
cu&s;tom is Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved by all his High|ne&s;&s;es
Gari&s;ons, whil&s;t he him&s;elf goes con|&s;tantly
to the Calvini&s;t Church adjoyning
to the Court, with his Children, being five
Sons, two Daughters, and two Daughters-in-Law.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other Acts of Publick Piety and
Charity, this Prince hath e&s;tabli&s;hed and en|dowed
&s;ome Religious Hou&s;es or Nunneries
for Prote&s;tant young Ladies, where they
may live virtuou&s;ly, and &s;pend their time in

HE that hath read in the Hi&s;tories of this

Entering into <HI>Swedeland,</HI> at a place
called <HI>Land&s;ort,</HI> we &s;ail'd forward among&s;t high
Rocks, having no other pro&s;pect from Land
but Mountains till we came to <HI>Dollers,</HI> which
is about four Swedi&s;h, that is, twenty four
Engli&s;h Miles from <HI>Stockholm,</HI> the Capital
City of the Kingdom. Upon my coming
a&s;hore, I confe&s;s I was a little &s;urprized to
&s;ee the Poverty of the People; and the little
Wooden Hou&s;es they lived in, not unlike
Soldiers Huts in a Leaguer; but much more,
when I di&s;covered little el&s;e in the Country
but Mountainous Rocks, and &s;tanding Lakes
of Water. The Reader will excu&s;e me, I
hope, if I remark not all that I may have

However, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omewhat of that too,

upon that Road the City of <HI>Stock|holm</HI>
looks great, becau&s;e of the King's Pa|lace,
the Hou&s;es of Noblemen, and &s;ome
Churches which are &s;eated upon Rocks: And
indeed, the whole City and Suburbs &s;tand
upon Rocks, unle&s;s it be &s;ome few Hou&s;es
built upon Ground gained from the Rivers
that run through the Town. <HI>Stockholm</HI> has
its Name from a Stock or Log of Wood,
which three Brothers threw into the Water
five Miles above the City, making a Vow,
that where-ever that Stock &s;hould &s;top, they
would build a Ca&s;tle to dwell in. The Stock
&s;topt at the Holm, or Rock where the Pa|lace
of the King now &s;tands: And the Bro|thers,
to be as good as their word, there
built their Ca&s;tle, which invited others to do
the like; &s;o that in proce&s;s of time the other
Rocks or Holms were covered with Build|ings,
which at length became the Capital
<PB N="119" REF="64">
City of the Kingdom. It is now embeli&s;hed
with a great many &s;tately Hou&s;es, and much
improved from what it was 400 Years ago,
as indeed mo&s;t Cities are; for the Stadthou&s;e
then built, is &s;o contemptible and low, that in
<HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>England</HI> it would not be &s;uffered
to &s;tand to di&s;grace the Nation. The Coun|cil-Chamber
where the Burghma&s;ters and
Raedt &s;it, is two Rooms ca&s;t into one, not
above nine Foot high; and the two Rooms
where the Sheriffs and the Erve College
(which is a Judicature like to the Doctors
Commons in <HI>England)</HI> &s;it, are not above
eight Foot and a half high. The King's Pa|lace
is a large Square of Stone-building, in
&s;ome places very high, but an old and irre|gular
Fabrick, without a &s;ufficient quantity
of Ground about it for Gardens and Walks.
It was anciently &s;urrounded with Water; but
&s;ome Years &s;ince part of it was filled up to
make a Way from the Ca&s;tle-Gate down in|to
the old Town. In this Palace there are
large Rooms; but the Lodgings of the King,
Queen, and Royal Family, are three Pair of
Stairs high, the Rooms in the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond
Stories being de&s;tin'd for the Senate-Chamber,
and other Courts of Judicature.
The King's Library is four Pair of Stairs
high, being a Room about forty &s;ix Foot
&s;quare, with a Clo&s;et adjoyning to it not
half the Dimen&s;ions. When I con&s;idered
the Apartments and Furniture of this Court,
<PB N="120" REF="65">
I began to think that the French Author
wrote Truth, who in his Remarks upon
<HI>Swedeland</HI> &s;ays, That when Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI>
re&s;igned the Crown to <HI>Carolus Gu&s;tavus,</HI> the
Father of this pre&s;ent King, &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of
the be&s;t of the Furniture of the Court, and
gave away a large &s;hare of the Crown-Lands
to her Favorites; in &s;o much that the King,
con&s;idering the poor Condition &s;he had left
the Kingdom in, and &s;eeing the Court &s;o
meanly furni&s;hed, &s;aid, That had he known
before he accepted the Crown, what then
he did, he would have taken other Mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>There are many other &s;tately Palaces in
<HI>Stockholm</HI> belonging to the Nobility; but
many of them for want of Repairs, and not
being inhabited, run to ruine; &s;everal of the
Nobles who lived in them formerly, having
lo&s;t the E&s;tates that maintained their ancient
Splendor, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter, being
retired unto a Country Life. There are al|&s;o
&s;ome other Magnificent Structures begun,
but not fini&s;hed, as that &s;tately Building in|tended
for a Parliament-Hou&s;e for the No|bles,
and two or three Churches: But what
I mo&s;t wonder at, is the Vault wherein the
late King lies buried, is not as yet covered
but with Boards, for it is to be ob&s;erved that
the Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> have no Tombs and Mo|numents
as in <HI>England</HI> and other Countries;
but are put into Copper Coffins, with In|&s;criptions
<PB N="121" REF="65">
on them, and placed one by ano|ther
in Vaults, adjoyning to the Gray-Friers
Church. The&s;e Vaults are about eight in
Number, having Turrets over them, with
Veins of Copper gilt, carved into the Cy|phers
of the &s;everal Kings who give them
their Names by being the fir&s;t that are inter|red
in them. The Vault of the late King is
not yet fini&s;hed, no more than the Fabricks
above-mentioned, which perhaps may be
imputed to the late Troubles of <HI>Swedeland.</HI>
The Number of the Inhabitants of <HI>Stockholm</HI>
are al&s;o much decrea&s;ed within the&s;e few
Years, partly by rea&s;on of the removal of
the Court of Admiralty and the Kings Ships
from that City to <HI>Charles-Crown,</HI> a new Ha|ven
lately made about 200 Engli&s;h Miles
from thence, which hath drawn many Fa|milies
belonging to the Fleet and Admiralty
from <HI>Stockholm</HI> to live there: And partly,
becau&s;e many of the Nobility, Gentry, and
tho&s;e that depended on them, are, as I &s;aid
before, withdrawn from <HI>Stockholm</HI> to a re|tired
Life in the Country. Neverthele&s;s the
ordinary &s;ort of Burghers, who &s;till remain,
are extreamly poor; &s;eeing the Women are
fain to work like Hor&s;es, drawing Carts, and
as Labourers in <HI>England,</HI> &s;erving Ma&s;ons and
Bricklayers with Stone, Bricks and Mortar,
and unloading Ve&s;&s;els that bring tho&s;e Mate|rials;
&s;ome of the poor Creatures in the
Summer-time toiling in their Smocks with|out
<PB N="122" REF="66">
either Shooes or Stockings. They per|form
al&s;o the part of Watermen, and for a
&s;mall matter will Row Pa&s;&s;engers 40 Miles
or more if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Court here is very thin and &s;ilent,
the King living frugally, and &s;eldom Dining
in publick. He Eats commonly with the
two Queens, his Mother and Con&s;ort, who
is a Virtuous Prince&s;s, Si&s;ter to the King of
<HI>Denmark.</HI> She is the Mother of five Chil|dren,
three Sons and two Daughters, with
whom &s;he &s;pends mo&s;t of her time in Re|tirement.
The King is a goodly Prince,
whom God hath Ble&s;&s;ed and Endowed with
Accompli&s;hments far beyond what might
have been expected from his Education,
wherein he was extreamly abu&s;ed, being
Taught little more than his Mother Tongue.
He is Gracious, Ju&s;t and Valiant, con&s;tant
at his Devotion, and utterly aver&s;e from all
kind of Debauchery, and the unfa&s;hionable
Vanities of other Courts, in Plays and
Dancing.</P>
<P>His &s;ports are Hunting and Exerci&s;ing of
his Guards, and he rarely appears publickly,
or gives Audience to Strangers, which is
imputed to his Sen&s;e of the neglect of his
Education. He is a Prince that hath had a
very hard beginning in the World, which
hath many times proved fortunate to great
Men; and indeed, if we con&s;ider all the
circum&s;tances of his early Misfortunes, how
<PB N="123" REF="66">
he was &s;lighted and neglected by his Nobles,
who would hardly vouch&s;afe to pay him a
vi&s;it when he was among them in the Coun|try,
or to do him Homage for the Lands
they held of the Crown; and how by the
pernicious Coun&s;els of the French, and the
weakne&s;s or treachery of his Governors, he
was mi&s;led into a War that almo&s;t co&s;t him
his Crown, having lo&s;t the be&s;t of his Ter|ritories
in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Schonen,</HI> and mo&s;t of
his Forces both by Sea and Land: If, I &s;ay,
the&s;e things be con&s;idered, it will probably
appear, that hardly any Prince before him
hath in a &s;horter time, or more fully &s;etled
the Authority and Prerogative of the Crown,
than he hath done in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for which he
&s;tands no ways obliged to <HI>France,</HI> as he was
for the Re&s;tauration of what he lo&s;t during
the War. He is now as ab&s;olute as the French
King, and makes Edicts, which have the
Force of Laws, without the concurrence of
the E&s;tates of the Kingdom. He hath erected
two Judicatures, the one called the College
of Reduction, and the other of In&s;pections;
the fir&s;t of which hath put his Maje&s;ty in
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again of all Lands alienated from
the Crown, and the other called to account
all Per&s;ons, even the Heirs and Executors of
tho&s;e who had cheated the Crown, and
made them refund what they or their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors
had appropriated to their own u&s;e of
<PB N="124" REF="67">
the publick Revenue. The&s;e two nece&s;&s;ary
Con&s;titutions, as they have reduced many
great Families to a pinch, who formerly
lived &s;plendidly upon the Crown Lands and
Revenues, and obliged them to live at home
upon their ancient and private Patrimony in
the Country, which is one great cau&s;e that
the Court of <HI>Sweden</HI> is at pre&s;ent &s;o unfre|quented;
&s;o have they enabled his Maje&s;ty;
without burdening of his Subjects, to &s;upport
the Charges of the Government, and to
maintain 64000 Men in pay. The Truth is,
his other Revenues are but &s;mall, what a|ri&s;es
from the Copper and Iron Mines, one
Silver Mine, the Pitch and Tar, the Cu|&s;toms
and Exci&s;e amounts to no extraordi|nary
Sum of Money, and the Land Tax in
&s;o barren a Country &s;carcely de&s;erving to be
named. The Cu&s;tomes and Exci&s;e, I con|fe&s;s,
are very high, and the rigorous manner
of exacting them pernicious to Trade: As for
in&s;tance; If a Ship come to <HI>Stockholme</HI> from
<HI>London,</HI> with a hundred &s;everal &s;orts of Goods,
and tho&s;e Goods a&s;&s;igned to fifty &s;everal
Men more or le&s;s, if any of tho&s;e fifty do
not pay the Cu&s;tom of what belongs to him,
though it be for a Barrel of Beer, the Ship
&s;hall not be unladen, nor no Man have his
Goods out, though he hath fully pay'd the
Cu&s;toms for them, till this la&s;t Man hath
pay'd his. There are &s;everal other &s;illy
<PB N="125" REF="67">
Cu&s;toms in <HI>Swedeland</HI> that di&s;courages Men
from Trading there; as if any Stranger Die
there, a third of his E&s;tate mu&s;t go to the
City or Town where he Traded. No Fo|reign
Merchant in <HI>Stockholme</HI> can Travel in|to
any Country where there is a Fair with|out
a Pa&s;&s;port: And at pre&s;ent, &s;eeing there
is no Treaty of Trade betwixt <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Sweden,</HI> though the Engli&s;h bring as con&s;ide|rable
a Trade to that Kingdom as any other
Country what&s;oever, yet they are very un|kindly
u&s;ed by the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e;
whereas the Dutch in <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and
other Cities, have new and greater Privi|leges
allowed them. Nor would I Coun&s;el
an Engli&s;h-man to go to Law with a Swedi&s;h
Burgher in <HI>Sweden,</HI> e&s;pecially if he be a
Whiggi&s;h Scot, who hath got his Freedom
in <HI>Stockholme,</HI> for tho&s;e are a kind of Scrapers,
whom I have ob&s;erved to be more inveterate
again&s;t the Engli&s;h than the Native Swedes.</P>
<P>Of all the Swedi&s;h Army of 64000 Men,
the King keeps but 12 Companies of 200
Men a-peice, with &s;ome few Hor&s;e Guards
in <HI>Stockholme,</HI> who are not upon Duty as
Sentinels at the Court Gates, as at the Courts
of other Princes. The re&s;t are di&s;per&s;ed in|to
Quarters and Gari&s;ons upon the Frontiers,
which are &s;o far di&s;tant in that large compa&s;s
of Land which his Territories take up, that
it would require a hard and tedious work to
bring them together to a general Mu&s;ter.
<PB N="126" REF="68">
They are however kept under very &s;trict
Di&s;cipline, and tho&s;e that lie near, often
viewed by the King. They have odd &s;ort,
of Puni&s;hments for the Soldiers and Officers
of all Degrees: For Example, if a Serjeant
or Corporal be Drunk, or negligent on Du|ty,
they are put into Armour, and with three
Muskets tied under each Arm, made to walk
two Hours before the Court of Guard; yet,
for all the &s;everity of Di&s;cipline u&s;ed again&s;t
the Soldiers, they commit many Abu&s;es in
the Night time, Robbing, and &s;ometimes
killing Men upon the Streets in <HI>Stockholme,</HI>
where they have no Lights nor Guards as in
<HI>Copenhagen.</HI> In former times there have
been at one time 35 Colonels, be&s;ides Ge|neral
Officers in the Swedi&s;h Army, all the
Subjects of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but
at pre&s;ent there are few or none, unle&s;s it
be the Sons of &s;ome Scoti&s;h Officers De|cea&s;ed;
nor did I ever &s;ee an Engli&s;h-Man
in the Kings Guards, Hor&s;e or Foot, but
one, and the Son of Sir <HI>Edward Wood,</HI> who
hath &s;ince quitted the Service. The King
hath exceedingly won the Hearts of the
common People, not only by exempting
them from the Tyrannical juri&s;diction of the
Nobility and Gentry, who formerly would
by their own private Authority, puni&s;h and
put to Death the Pea&s;ants at their plea&s;ure,
which makes the Countries very willing to
Quarter the Kings Soldiers, but by his exact|ne&s;s
<PB N="127" REF="68">
in puni&s;hing Duels, Murder, and Rob|beries.
Perjury is Death here al&s;o, as in
<HI>Holland,</HI> which makes the Magi&s;trates in &s;ome
parts of this Kings Territories, enjoyn &s;trange
kinds of Oaths to deter Men from being for|&s;worn:
As for in&s;tance, in &s;ome places the
Witne&s;s is &s;et with a Staff in his Hand upon
&s;ome Peeble Stones and Charcoal, where he
is to imprecate and pray, that if what he
Sweareth be not true, his Land may become
as barren as tho&s;e Stones, and his Sub&s;tance
be Con&s;umed to A&s;hes like the Coals he &s;tands
on, which as &s;oon as he &s;teps down are &s;et
on Fire. This manner of Swearing &s;o ter|rifies
the People, that they commonly trem|ble
when they come to take their Oath.</P>

King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as of tho&s;e of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> and of other Princes and States
whom we have named, is Lutheran, who are
more rigid to Roman Catholicks and Calvi|ni&s;ts
than the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Germany.</HI> There
is no Toleration allowed here to Calvini&s;t
Mini&s;ters; and they take an effectual cour&s;e
to keep the Country clear of Prie&s;ts and Je|&s;uits,
by Guelding them, whether they be
young or old. In Commemoration of the
great Lo&s;&s;es and De&s;olation &s;u&s;tained in the
late War, the Suedes &s;trictly keep four Fa&s;ting
Days in the Months of <HI>April, May, June,</HI>
and <HI>July;</HI> on which days all Men are pro|hibited
by Authority to kindle Fire in their
<PB N="128" REF="69">
Hou&s;es, or to Eat till after Evening Service
is done, which in the Winter time could not
be endured. They delight much in Singing
in their Churches, which they con&s;tantly
perform twice every day, Morning and
Evening. In their Marryings, Chri&s;tenings,
and Buryings they are &s;o prodigally extrava|gant,
that if all three happen in one year to
a Man of a competent E&s;tate, it is enough
to break him. The Clergy of <HI>Sweden</HI> are
neither &s;o Rich nor Learned as tho&s;e of
<HI>Germany,</HI> wanting both the opportunities of
Study, and of conver&s;ing with Learned Men,
that tho&s;e of other Countrys enjoy, though
there be &s;ome Learned Men among&s;t them.
A Bi&s;hoprick in <HI>Sweden</HI> is no great Benefice,
if compared with &s;ome Par&s;onages in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
for the Arch-bi&s;hop, and Metropolitan
hath not above 400 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and &s;ome
of the re&s;t are not worth above 150 or 200 <HI>l.</HI>
a year. The inferiour Clergy are not &s;o
regular in their Lives and Conver&s;ation in the
Countries di&s;tant from <HI>Stockholme,</HI> as they are
near the Court; and the Rea&s;on is, partly
becau&s;e they entertain Travellers that pa&s;s the
Country, there being no Inns in mo&s;t places
for the Accommodation of Per&s;ons of any
Quality, and &s;o are obliged to drink with
their Gue&s;ts; and partly, becau&s;e at Buryings
and Chri&s;tenings, where there is commonly
high Drinking, the Pape or Par&s;on is Ma&s;ter
of the Ceremonies: And here give me leave
<PB N="129" REF="69">
to tell a &s;hort Story of one of them. A Pape
coming to Chri&s;ten a Child in a Church,
and finding a Scotch Man to be Godfather,
was &s;o tran&s;ported either with Zeal, or his
Cups, that when he came to exorci&s;e the
Child, which is a Rite u&s;ed in their Office of
Admini&s;tring this Sacrament; he neglected
the Form pre&s;cribed by the Liturgy, and in
an extemporary Prayer begg'd, that the Devil
might depart out of the Child, and enter
into that Scotti&s;h Heretick, for &s;o they call
the Presbyterians of that Nation. The Prayer
of the Pape &s;o incen&s;ed the Scot, that he
vowed Revenge, and watched the Pape with
a good Cudgel next day as he cro&s;&s;ed the
Church-yard, where he beat him, and left
him all in Blood lying on the Ground, and
crying out Murder. For this Fact the Scot
was had before the Ju&s;tice, who asking him,
How he dur&s;t be &s;o bold as to lay his profane
Hands upon the Man of God? He, who
knew very well what u&s;e to make of the De|vil
he had got, Foaming at the Mouth, and
cunningly acting the Demoniack, made an|&s;wer,
That the Pape might thank him&s;elf
for what he had met with; for &s;ince he had
Conjured the Devil into him he &s;pared no
Body, neither Wife nor Children, nor would
he &s;pare the Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, and with that
fell a mangling and tearing the Magi&s;trate,
that he was fain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> take him&s;elf to his
Heels, crying out <HI>O! the Devil, &s;ave me;</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="70">
and &s;o the Scot marched home, no Man da|ring
to lay hold on him, for fear of being
torn to pieces by the Devil. But the Ju&s;tice
recollecting him&s;elf, &s;ent for the Pape, told
him, That the Scot was a cunning Rogue,
and bid him go home, get a Plai&s;ter for his
Head, and be &s;ilent, le&s;t if the matter came
to the Bi&s;hops Ears he might be Cen&s;ured for
going again&s;t the Rubrick of the Liturgy.</P>
<P>The Famous Univer&s;ity where their Clergy
are bred, is <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> 8 Swedi&s;h Miles from
<HI>Stockholme.</HI> There are commonly 150, or
200 Students there, but no Endowed Col|leges,
as in other Countries. The Library
is &s;o mean and contemptible, that the Li|braries
of many Grammar Schools, and of
private Men in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> are far
better &s;tored with Books than it is. Upon
viewing of it, and that of the Kings Palace,
I called to mind the &s;aying of a French Man,
upon the like occa&s;ion; That <HI>Swedeland</HI>
came behind <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in the know|ledge
of Men and Things at lea&s;t 800 years;
yet &s;ome Swedes have been &s;o conceited of
the Antiquity of their Country, as to brag,
that Paradice was &s;eated in <HI>Sweden;</HI> that the
Country was turned into &s;uch heaps of Rocks
for the Rebellion of our fir&s;t Parents, and that
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> in a Coun|try
three Swedi&s;h Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Up&s;all.</HI>
A French Man &s;tanding by, and hearing this
Romantick Story, as I was told, fitted him
<PB N="131" REF="70">
with the like, telling him, that when the
World was made in &s;ix days, at the end of
the Creation all the Rubbi&s;h that remained
was thrown together into a Corner, which
made up <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI> And indeed,
the French &s;eem to have no great liking to
the Country, whatever kindne&s;s they may
have for the People; for a French Amba&s;&s;a|dor,
as an Author of that Country relates,
being by order of Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> Treated
in a Country Hou&s;e four Swedi&s;h Miles from
<HI>Stockholme,</HI> and upon the rode going and
coming, with all the Varieties and Plea&s;ures
that the Country could afford, on purpo&s;e
to make him have a good Opinion of the
&s;ame; made an&s;wer to the Queen, (who
asked him upon his return, What he thought
of <HI>Sweden)</HI> That were he Ma&s;ter of the
whole Country, he would pre&s;ently Sell it,
and Buy a Farm in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England;</HI> which,
under Favour, I think was a little Tart and
Sawcy.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed a con&s;iderable time in
<HI>Swedeland,</HI> and mo&s;t part at <HI>Stockholme,</HI> I &s;et
out from thence to go to <HI>El&s;enbourg</HI> by Land,
and went a little out of my way to &s;ee a
&s;mall City called <HI>Eubrone,</HI> Famous for a Coat
of Arms which it got in this manner. A
certain Ma&s;culine Queen of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who
had Conquered a great part of <HI>Sweden,</HI> com|ing
to this City, asked the Magi&s;trates, What
was the Arms of their City? Who having
<PB N="132" REF="71">
her, that they had none, &s;he plucked up her
Coats, and &s;quatting upon the Snow, bid
them take the mark &s;he left there for their
Arms; its pity &s;he did not give them a &s;ui|table
Motto to it al&s;o: What that Figure is
called in Blazonery I know not, but to this
Day the City u&s;es it in their Arms, and for
marking their Commodities. This Queen
came purpo&s;ely into <HI>Sweden,</HI> to pay a vi&s;it
to a brave Woman, that oppo&s;ed a King of
<HI>Swedeland,</HI> who in a time of Famine would
have put to Death all the Men and Women
in his Country above 60 years of Age. The
Country all the way I travelled in <HI>Swedeland</HI>
is much of the &s;ame quality of the Land a|bout
<HI>Stockholme,</HI> until I came near the Pro|vince
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> which is called the Store-hou&s;e,
and Kitchin of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the
Country is far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to Travel in this Province of
<HI>Schonen,</HI> becau&s;e of the Snaphances, who
were a kind of Bloody Robbers, now utter|ly
de&s;troyed by the King; &s;o that it is &s;afe
enough Travelling there. Entering into
<HI>Schonen</HI> I &s;aw 29 of the&s;e Rogues upon
Wheels, and el&s;ewhere in the Country, ten
and twenty at &s;everal places. The King u&s;ed
great &s;everity in de&s;troying of them; &s;ome
he cau&s;ed to be broken upon the Wheel, o|thers
Spitted in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulders, many had the Fle&s;h pinched
off of their Brea&s;ts, and &s;o were fa&s;tened to
<PB N="133" REF="71">
Stakes till they Died; and others again had
their No&s;es and both Hands cut off, and be|ing
&s;eared with a hot Iron, were let go to
acquaint their Comrades how they had been
&s;erved. The King is very &s;evere again&s;t High|way-Men
and Duellers. In above a 100 Miles
Travelling, we found not a Hou&s;e where there
was either French Wine or Brandy, which made
me tell a Swede of our Company, who was
Travelling to <HI>Denmark,</HI> that I would under|take
to &s;hew any Man 500 Hou&s;es, wherein
a Traveller might have Wine, and other good
Accommodation in the &s;pace of an Hundred
Miles upon any rode from <HI>London.</HI> There
are &s;everal &s;mall Towns and fertile Land in
this Country of <HI>Schonen,</HI> lying upon the
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">undt;</HI> at the narrowe&s;t part whereof lies
<HI>El&s;enbourg</HI> burnt down by the Danes in the
la&s;t War: Here I cro&s;t over to <HI>El&s;enore,</HI> the
pa&s;&s;age being but a League broad.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has a Ca&s;tle at <HI>El|&s;enore,</HI>
which commands the narrow pa&s;&s;age
of the <HI>Soundt,</HI> where all Ships that enter in|to,
or come out of the Baltick Sea mu&s;t pay
Toll. Having vi&s;ited this Ca&s;tle, and &s;taid
about a Fortnight with the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul,
and Sir <HI>John Paul,</HI> late Re&s;ident at the Court
of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> I went to the Dani&s;h Court
at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>COpenhagen</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Zec|land,
Jutland,</HI> or <HI>Denmark,</HI> and place
of Re&s;idence of the King: It &s;tands on a
<PB N="134" REF="72">
Flat, encompa&s;&s;ed with a plea&s;ant and de|lightful
Country, much re&s;embling <HI>England.</HI>
The Streets of the City are kept very neat and
clean, with Lights in the Night time for the
convenience and &s;afety of tho&s;e who are then
abroad; a Cu&s;tom not as yet introduced
into <HI>Stockholme,</HI> where it is dangerous
to be abroad when it is dark. The Kings
Men of War lie hear very conveniently, be|ing
orderly ranged betwixt Booms, after the
manner of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and near the Admi|ralty
Hou&s;e, which is a large pile of Building,
well furni&s;hed with Stores and Magazins, &s;e|cured
by a Cittadel, that not only commands
the City, but al&s;o the Haven, and entry in|to
it. The Court of <HI>Denmark</HI> is &s;plendid,
and makes a far greater figure in the World
than that of <HI>Sweden,</HI> though not many years
ago, in the time of <HI>Carolus Gu&s;tavus</HI> the Fa|ther
of the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> it was
almo&s;t reduced to its la&s;t, when the Walls of
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> &s;aved that Crown and Kingdom.
That Siege was Famous, carried on with great
vigour by the Swede, and as bravely main|tained
by the Danes: The Monuments
whereof are to be &s;een in the Cannon Bullets
gilt that &s;till remain in the Walls of &s;ome
Hou&s;es, and in the Steeple of the great Church
of the Town. The Royal Palace in <HI>Copen|hagen</HI>
is but &s;mall, and a very ancient Build|ing;
but his Maje&s;ties Hou&s;e <HI>Fredenburg</HI> is a
&s;tately Fabrick of Modern Architecture, and
<PB N="135" REF="72">
very richly Furni&s;hed. <HI>Denmark</HI> is at pre|&s;ent
a flouri&s;hing Kingdom, and the King,
who hath now made it Hereditary, &s;urpa&s;&s;es
mo&s;t of his Predece&s;&s;ors in Power and
Wealth: He hath much enlarged his Domi|nions,
as well as Authority; and by his Per|&s;onal
and Royal Virtues, no le&s;s than the e|minent
qualities of a great many able Mini|&s;ters
of State, he hath gained the Univer&s;al
Love of his Subjects, and the e&s;teem of all
Foreign Princes and States. The Court is
much frequented every day, but e&s;pecially
on Sundays, where about Eleven of the Clock
in the Morning, the Nobility, Foreign Mi|ni&s;ters,
and Officers of the Army a&s;&s;emble,
and make a glorious Appearance. There
one may &s;ee many Knights of the Order of
the Elephant of <HI>Malto;</HI> but I never &s;aw any
Order of the like Nature as that of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
that King rarely appearing in his George and
Garter; but on days of publick Audience I
have ob&s;erved at one time above 150 Coaches
attending at the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which
are ten times more than ever I &s;aw together
at that of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The King is affable, and
of ea&s;ie acce&s;s to Strangers, &s;een often abroad
by his Subjects in his Gardens and Stables,
which are very large, and well furni&s;hed
with all &s;orts of Hor&s;es. He is a great lover
of Engli&s;h Hor&s;es and Dogs, and delights
much in Hunting, as his Elde&s;t Son the Prince,
with his Brothers do in Cock-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ighting; in&s;o|much
<PB N="136" REF="73">
much, that the Engli&s;h Merchants cannot
make a more acceptable pre&s;ent to tho&s;e
Princes, than of Engli&s;h Game-Cocks. The
&s;tanding Forces of <HI>Denmark</HI> are well di&s;ci|plined
Men, and Commanded by good
Officers, both Natives and Strangers, both
French and Scots, as Major General <HI>Duncan,</HI>
and Major General <HI>Veldun,</HI> both Scotti&s;h-Men,
whom I &s;aw at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The Soldiers as
well as Courtiers are quartered upon the Ci|tizens,
a Cu&s;tom which is likewi&s;e practi&s;ed
in <HI>Sweden,</HI> and tho' &s;omewhat unea&s;ie, yet
not repined at by the People, who by the
care and good Government of the King,
find Trade much advanced. For his Ma|je&s;ty
by encouraging Strangers of all Reli|gions
to live in his Dominions, and allowing
the French and Dutch Calvini&s;ts, to have
publick Churches, hath brought many Tra|ding
Families to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and by the
mea&s;ure he hath taken for &s;etling Trade in
prohibiting the Importation of Foreign Ma|nufactures,
and Reforming and new Model|ling
the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>India</HI> Companies, hath
much encrea&s;ed Commerce, and thereby
the Wealth of his Subjects; &s;o that notwith|&s;tanding
the new Taxes impo&s;ed upon all
Coaches, Wagons, Ploughs, and all real and
per&s;onal E&s;tates, which amount to con&s;ide|rable
Sums of Money; the People live very
well and contented. There are commonly
about 8000 Men in Gari&s;on in <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
<PB N="137" REF="73">
his Maje&s;ties Regiment of Foot Guards, who
are all Cloathed in Red, with Cloaks to keep
them warm in the Winter time, is a very hand|&s;ome
Body of Men; and with the Hor&s;e
Guards, who are bravely mounted, and have
their Granadeers and Hautboys, make a very
fine &s;hew. His Maje&s;ty hath cau&s;ed &s;everal
new Fortifications to be built upon the <HI>Elb,</HI>
and other Rivers, and hath now in his Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
that &s;trong Ca&s;tle called <HI>Hilgueland,</HI>
at pre&s;ent commanded by a Scotti&s;h-man. The
Queen of <HI>Denmark</HI> is a mo&s;t virtuous Prin|ce&s;s,
Si&s;ter to the pre&s;ent Landtgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e
Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> and in Per&s;wa&s;ion a Calvini&s;t, ha|ving
a Chapel allowed her within the Court,
though the publick Religion of the King and
Kingdom be Lutheran. The Clergy here are
Learned, many of them having &s;tudied at
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where they learnt the
Engli&s;h Language; and among&s;t the Bi&s;hops
there is one Doctor <HI>King</HI> the Son of a Scot|ti&s;h-man.
But &s;eeing it is my de&s;ign rather
to ob&s;erve the condition of the People, than
to be punctual in de&s;cribing all the Rarities that
are remarkable in the Countries I have been
in, I &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
by acquainted the Reader that the Peo|ple
of that Country live far better than the
Swedes, and as well as mo&s;t of their adjoyning
Neighbours; and that there are &s;everal places,
both there, and in <HI>Norway,</HI> which have the
Names of Engli&s;h Towns, as <HI>Arundale, Tot|ne&s;s,
London,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="74">
When I fir&s;t began to write this Trea|ti&s;e,
I had &s;ome thoughts of making Ob&s;er|vations
upon the &s;everal Governments of
other States and Dominions, where I had
travelled &s;ome years before I was in the
Countries I have been &s;peaking of, as of the
re&s;t of <HI>Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy,</HI>
and <HI>France;</HI> but that was a Subject &s;o large,
and the u&s;efulne&s;s of it to my pre&s;ent De|&s;ign
&s;o incon&s;iderable, that by doing &s;o, I
found I could neither &s;atisfie the Curious, by
adding any thing material to tho&s;e many
who have already obliged the Publick by
the Remarks of their Travels in tho&s;e Pla|ces;
or make my di&s;contented Country|men
more aver&s;e than they are already from
removing into tho&s;e Countries, where I
think few of them will chu&s;e to tran&s;port
them&s;elves for the &s;ake of Liberty and Pro|perty,
though <HI>England</HI> were even wor&s;e than
they them&s;elves fancy it can be. All that
remains to be done then, is to conclude this
Treati&s;e with an obvious and popular Re|mark,
that tho&s;e Countries, where Cities
are greate&s;t and mo&s;t frequented by volun|tary
Inhabitants, are always the be&s;t to live
in; and by comparing the City of <HI>London</HI>
with all other Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> and demon|&s;trating
by the Surveys I have made, (which
I think will hardly be contradicted or con|futed)
that of all the Capital Cities of <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
it is the bigge&s;t and mo&s;t populous, and
<PB N="139" REF="74">
&s;o prove con&s;equentially that <HI>England,</HI> for
the generality of People, is the be&s;t Coun|try
in the World, e&s;pecially for its Natives,
to live in. Now this being an Ob&s;ervation
(for what I know) not hitherto made good
by Induction and In&s;tance, (as I intend to
do it) I hope it will plea&s;e the Reader as
much, as if I gave him a particular account
of other Countries and Governments, and
leave it to his own Reflection to &s;tate the
Compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Though <HI>London</HI> within the Walls cannot
vye for bigne&s;s with many Cities of <HI>Europe;</HI>
yet take the City and Suburbs together, ac|cording
as it hath been &s;urvey'd by Mr. <HI>Mor|gan,</HI>
in breadth from St. <HI>George</HI>'s Church in
<HI>Southwark</HI> to <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> and in length from
<HI>Limehou&s;e</HI> to <HI>Petty-France</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and
it is in a va&s;t proportion larger in compa&s;s
of Ground, and number of Hou&s;es, than
any City in <HI>Europe</HI> what&s;oever. This I &s;hall
demon&s;trate fir&s;t, by comparing it with
&s;ome Cities of <HI>Holland,</HI> and then with the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities of the other Coun|tries
of <HI>Europe,</HI> which I &s;hall &s;et down in an
Alphabetical Order, with the number of the
Hou&s;es they &s;everally contain.</P>
<P>When <HI>London</HI> and Suburbs was &s;urveyed
&s;ome years ago by Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI> there were
reckoned to be in it 84000 Hou&s;es, be&s;ides
Ho&s;pitals, Alms-hou&s;es, and other Buildings,
that paid no Chimney-money to the King:
<PB N="140" REF="75">
Now if tho&s;e were added, and the va&s;t
number of new Hou&s;es that have been built
&s;ince that Survey, upon mode&s;t computa|tion
<HI>London</HI> may be reckoned to contain
100000 Hou&s;es; nay, 'tis believed 120000,
which truly con&s;idering the extraordinary
Additions that have been made lately, is not
improbable; I know the <HI>French</HI> vapour, and
would per&s;wade the World, that <HI>Paris</HI> is
much bigger than <HI>London.</HI> And the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI>
will &s;carce believe, that <HI>London</HI> hath
more Hou&s;es than the 18 Cities in <HI>Holland</HI>
that have Voices in the States, for (&s;ay they)
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;tands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, and <HI>London</HI> &s;tands but upon 1800.
To both which I an&s;wer, That it is very
true that <HI>Paris</HI> takes up a great &s;pot of
Ground, but then you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that in
<HI>Paris</HI> there are &s;everal hundreds of Mona|&s;teries,
Churches, Colleges, and Cloi&s;ters,
&s;ome of them having large Gardens, and
that in <HI>Paris</HI> there are 7500 Palaces and
Ports for Coaches, which have likewi&s;e great
Gardens; whereas <HI>London</HI> is very thick built,
and in the City the Hou&s;es have &s;carce a
Yard big enough to &s;et a Pump or Hou&s;e of
Conveniency in; but the Weekly Bills of
Mortality will decide this Que&s;tion, and
plainly give it to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o doth Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>la Cour,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> in his la&s;t
E&s;&s;ays dedicated to the King, making it ap|pear,
that <HI>London</HI> is bigger than <HI>Paris, Roan,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="75">
and <HI>Rochel</HI> altogether; and as for <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>
I do appeal to all knowing Men that
have &s;een it, that although it be true, that
it &s;tands upon 1000 Morgans of Land, yet
there is not above 400 Morgans built; and
this I prove thus, that the large Gardens,
on the <HI>Heeregraft, Ky&s;ersgraft,</HI> and <HI>Princegraft,</HI>
and the Burghwalls of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> take up more
than a third part of the City; then reckon the

Exact Relation
Of the ENTERTAINMENT of His
Mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty,
WILLIAM III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At the HAG&V;E.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty being earne&s;tly En|treated
by the States of <HI>Holland,</HI>
and the Confederate Princes in
<HI>Germany, &amp;c.</HI> to meet at a General Congre&s;s,
to be held at the <HI>Hague,</HI> in order to Concert
matters for the next Campaign, was plea&s;ed
to Conde&s;cend to their Reque&s;t, and hazard
His Royal Per&s;on by Sea, (though in the
depth of Winter) His Noble Zeal for the
Good of us in particular, and <HI>Europe</HI> in
general, &s;urmounting all tho&s;e Difficulties:
Whereupon he accordingly took Shipping
<PB N="2" REF="81">
on the Sixteenth of <HI>January 1690-91.</HI> in a
Yacht, then lying at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and &s;et Sail
that Afternoon, being attended by divers
Yatchts and Men of War, and a Noble Re|tinue
of Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality; but by
Rea&s;on of the very thick Mi&s;ts, and con&s;e|quently
little Wind, was four days before he
could make the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland;</HI> yet, at la&s;t,
when he arrived within two or three
Leagues of <HI>Goree,</HI> His Maje&s;ty ventured to
go a Shoar in the Boat, attended by the
Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and
my Lord <HI>Overkirke, &amp;c.</HI> and another Boat, but
mo&s;t unfortunately there fell &s;o thick a Fog,
and the Ice &s;urrounded them &s;o clo&s;ely, that
neither could they make the Shoar, nor get
back to the Ship, but were forc'd to lie &s;till
for two and twenty Hours, enduring the
mo&s;t bitter Cold, and without (almo&s;t)
hopes of ever getting alive on Shoar: All
which, His Maje&s;ty bore with His wanted
Magnanimity and Courage, and when one
of the Boat-men too freely expre&s;&s;ed his Fear
of Death, he reproved him with this Noble
&s;aying, <HI>What are you afraid to Die in my Com|pany.</HI>
But it plea&s;ed the Almighty Provi|dence,
at length to di&s;&s;ipate the Mi&s;t, and
Conduct His Royal Maje&s;ty &s;afely to the
Shoar, and on the 21&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> about
half an hour after Ten, landed at the <HI>Orange
Polder,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> a little
below <HI>Ma&s;eland-Sluyce,</HI> but by the long con|tinuance

in the Cold, was &s;o Benummed,
that he could hardly either &s;tand or Speak.
From hence His Maje&s;ty went immediately
to the Hou&s;e of the Heer Van <HI>Rynenbergh,</HI>
where having refre&s;hed Him&s;elf, and Dined,
He ha&s;ted to <HI>Houn&s;laerdyke,</HI> where He was
met, and Congratulated with all Demon|&s;trations
of Re&s;pects and Joy, by the Depu|ties
of the States; as al&s;o by Prince <HI>Ca&s;imir</HI>
of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> Stadtholder of <HI>Friezeland,</HI> whom
His Maje&s;ty received with all the Marks of
the mo&s;t tender Affection imaginable, Em|bracing
and Ki&s;&s;ing them with great Ar|dency.
Prince <HI>Na&s;&s;au Sarbruggen,</HI> the Count
Van <HI>Hoorn,</HI> and divers other Per&s;ons of Qua|tity,
here likewi&s;e Congratulated His Maje|&s;ties
happy arrival, who were all mo&s;t
kindly received by His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>'Twas expected that the King would have
lain here this Night, and &s;o have entred the
<HI>Hague</HI> by day light; but on the contrary,
His extraordinary De&s;ire of entring imme|diately
upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, would not let Him
give Him&s;elf &s;o much as one Nights ea&s;e;
And His Maje&s;ty, after a very &s;hort Refre&s;h|ment
here, departed for the <HI>Hague,</HI> attended
with five or &s;ix Coaches with &s;ix Hor&s;es:
In His own Coach accompanied Him the
Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Overkirk,</HI>
arriving at the <HI>Hague</HI> about half an hour after
five in the Evening; where (though he was
not that Night expected) there wanted not
<PB N="4" REF="84">
the general Acclamations of the People of all
&s;orts, who run by His Coach, crying out,
<HI>Long Live King</HI> William, <HI>Welcom, Welcom,
&amp;c.</HI> His Maje&s;ty Rode through the Trium|phant
Arches, Erected by the Lords of the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and the Honourable the Lords Com|mittee
of the Council of <HI>Holland,</HI> (of which
we &s;hall give an exact De&s;cription in their
proper Places) directly to the Court, where
being arrived, and the Gates &s;hut to keep
out the extraordinary pre&s;s of People, thirty
peices of Cannon, which were planted up|on
the <HI>Vyverberg,</HI> were thrice di&s;charged,
Publick Thank&s;givings were made in all the
Churches, and the Bells rung with great
Joy; and throughout the Town almo&s;t all
the Hou&s;es were Illuminated with great
numbers of Candles in their Windows,
whil&s;t all the People, Rich and Poor, Old
and Young, made all Demon&s;trations of
their inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy for His Maje&s;ties
mo&s;t happy Arrival.</P>
<P>That Evening the Earl of <HI>Berka,</HI> Envoy
Extraordinary from the Emperor, waited
upon His Maje&s;ty, and was a long time in
private with Him; and the next day &s;everal
Members of the States, and divers Per&s;ons
of Quality came to Compliment His Maje|&s;ty,
and Congratulate His Arrival.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of the &s;everal Confederate
Princes, who upon the Kings arrival had
&s;ent Expre&s;&s;es to their re&s;pective Ma&s;ters,
<PB N="5" REF="84">
a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves in Congre&s;s; imme|diately
after their breaking up, the Imperial,
Spani&s;h, and Brandenburgh Envoys, came
to wait upon His Maje&s;ty; as al&s;o the
Council of State, and the Lords of the Ge|neral
Accounts, with all their Members, to
Congratulate and Complement Him.</P>
<P>The King immediately applied Him&s;elf
to the Affairs of State, and taking fir&s;t into
His Con&s;ideration the Sea Affairs, gave the
Command of the Dutch Fleet to the Heer
<HI>Cornelius</HI> Van <HI>Tromp,</HI> with the Title of Vice-Admiral
of <HI>Holland,</HI> who gratefully accep|ted
the &s;ame, and immediately beat up his
Drums for Seamen, who flocked to him in
great abundance. His Maje&s;ty gave al&s;o out
Commi&s;&s;ions for two Regiments of <HI>Mariners</HI>
to be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who had
waited &s;ome time at <HI>Cleave,</HI> as &s;oon as he
received advice of His Maje&s;ties arrival, &s;et
forward for the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time it was De&s;ired, and
Agreed to by His Maje&s;ty, That His Ma|je&s;ty
would Plea&s;e to Honour the <HI>Hague</HI>
with a Publick Entry, on <HI>Monday, January</HI>
the 26th: Whereupon the Trained Bands,
and the Guards were ordered to be ready;
And accordingly on <HI>Monday,</HI> at two of the
Clock in the Afternoon, His Maje&s;ty went
out of the Town by the way of the <HI>Vyver|berg,</HI>
to the North-end, and from thence
<PB N="6" REF="85">
round the Wall to the We&s;t-end, and &s;o to
the <HI>Houn&s;laerdyke,</HI> or <HI>Loo&s;duyn</HI>'s-bridge, where
began the Triumph. Over this Bridge was
Erected, by the Burgherma&s;ters of the
<HI>Hague,</HI> a Triumphant Arch, the Figure
whereof we have here Repre&s;ented. Over
the Arch in the Front, is a Man and a
Woman &s;tanding at an Altar Sacrificing,
with the Words, <HI>Io Triumphe.</HI> On the top
of all &s;tands the Statue of His Maje&s;ty, with
a Staff in His right Hand, at the top of
which is a Cypher of His Name, with a
Crown. On the two Columns of the Arch,
on one &s;ide are the&s;e Words,
<Q><P>Ob Cives Servatos: For having pre&s;erved
his Country-men.</P>
<P>Ob Ho&s;tes Fugatos: For having de&s;troyed
his Enemies.</P></Q>
and on the other &s;ide,
<Q><P>Re&s;titutis Provinciis: The Provinces being
Re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Libertatis Regnis: The Kingdoms being
Delivered.</P></Q></P>
<P>Behind each Column is a &s;mall Oval, in
one a Lawrel with this Word,
<Q>Victoria, Victory,</Q>
on the other a Palm, with the Word,
<Q>Clementia, Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>Here His Maje&s;ty was received by the
Magi&s;trates of the <HI>Hague,</HI> who Complimen|ted

Him, and Congratulated His Arrival,
the Pen&s;ionary <HI>Vander Hoeck</HI> being their
Speaker, who humbly Thanked the King
in the Name of the Magi&s;trates and Burg|hers,
for the Honour His Maje&s;ty was plea|&s;ed
to do them by His Pre&s;ence, in a mo&s;t
Eloquent Oration.</P>
<P>From hence was a Lane made on each
&s;ide by the Burghers in Arms, who appeared
in very great Splendour, being mo&s;t of them
very richly clad, many having been at great
Expence for their Equipage.</P>
<P>The&s;e Trained Bands con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix Com|panies,
of about two and three Hundred
Men in each Company; they make in all
about Fifteen Hundred Men: The&s;e &s;tand|ing
in their Order, reached all along the
We&s;t-end, the great Market, the High Street,
and &s;o to the Court-yard.</P>
<P>All along this way, quite up to the Court,
before the Hou&s;es and Stalls, were built
Scaffolds, which were filled by a va&s;t multi|tude
of Spectators, who &s;crupled not to give
an 100 Guilders in &s;ome places for the u&s;e
of a Chamber during the Shew. The num|ber
of Spectators being the greate&s;t that has
ever been &s;een in the <HI>Hague;</HI> in&s;omuch, that
one would have judged all the Inhabitants
of <HI>Holland</HI> to have been in this Town.</P>
<P>After the Pen&s;ionary had ended his Speech,
and His Maje&s;ty kindly Thanked them, the
Cavalcade proceeded. Fir&s;t went two very
<PB N="8" REF="88">
rich Coaches with &s;ix Hor&s;es, in which were
divers Per&s;ons of Quality, next the Kings
Life Guard, the Officers in extraordinary
rich Equipage: After them a great number
of Lacquees and Footmen all in the Kings
Livery, and black Velvet Caps; after them
came the Kings Pages, Gentlemen, and Ser|vants
on Hor&s;eback, in extraordinary rich
Liveries. Then came His Maje&s;ty riding in
a large, and very richly Gilt Coach, drawn
by Six White Stone Hor&s;es, accompanied by
the Lord <HI>Overkirk</HI> on the left Hand, and the
Earls of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Scarborough</HI> over-again&s;t
him. On each &s;ide of the Coach the
Switzers with their Halbards, in rich Livery
Coats al&s;o, walked on Foot. The Provo&s;t
General <HI>Urck,</HI> and the Heer <HI>Roulas</HI> Captain
of the Switzers rid on Hor&s;eback immediate|ly
before the Kings Coach, and after it came
about Twelve Coaches with Six Hor&s;es,
wherein Rid the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the Earls
of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Portland,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>London,</HI> and &s;everal other Engli&s;h Noblemen;
as al&s;o the chief Mini&s;ters of the Govern|ment,
and the Magi&s;trates of the <HI>Hague,</HI>
be&s;ides the&s;e, were many Coaches with
Four Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The King as he pa&s;&s;ed along, was Salu|ted,
and Complimented by divers Per&s;ons
of Quality, which His Maje&s;ty returned
with great Kindne&s;s, often looking out of
the Coach, with great Satisfaction upon the

People, who &s;houted with extraordinary
Chearfulne&s;s, crying out, <HI>Long Live the King

hold out till the Relief came; but all would
not do, the Burghers wre re&s;olved, and they
being &s;tronger than the Gari&s;on, who were
all employed in the Outworks, the Honourable
Governor was forced to &s;ubmit, and about
Midnight the Capitulation was Signed on

a Gate of the Town was deliver'd up to the

<P><HI>April</HI> the 22d, His Maje&s;ty having taken
leave of the States General, and been Com|plimented
by them, with all the Expre&s;|&s;ions
of &s;incere Affection, took Shiping

extraordinary Joy imaginable; and by the
Guns of the Forts of <HI>Tilbury, Grave&s;end,</HI> and
the Tower; al&s;o by the Ships that lay in the

<P>Thus have we fini&s;hed our &s;hort Journal
of His Maje&s;ties Voyage into <HI>Holland,</HI> where|in
we have been as particular as was conve|nient,
and as brief as po&s;&s;ible; we have all
along carefully avoided all manner of Re|flections
and Animadver&s;ions of our own,
and given only a true Relation of the matter
of Fact as it occur'd; wherein if we have
the good Fortune to plea&s;e the Reader, we
have our End.</P>
