<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my la&s;t of the 12th. in&s;tant, We have had ano|ther engagement with the Hollander, which was di&s;puted with &s;undry fiery arguments, and maintai|ned with great gallantry on both &s;ides; for, indeed they are a very &s;tout enemy, and fight with great courage and magnanimity of Spirit, and as their &s;hips are of a great Bulk and Burthen, &s;o are they al&s;o well man'd; their Mus|quetiers man the Decks with unre&s;i&s;table courage, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="4" REF="3">the bullets flying as thick as hail (a compa|ri&s;on by way of &s;imile) their Captains are excellent Na|vigators, and &s;eem to infu&s;e a &s;econd nature into the Ma|riners, before an a&s;&s;ault be given, the better to inable them to with&s;tand a &s;torm, that is; before they begin to &s;ight, it is their u&s;uall cu&s;tome, to give each one three cups of Brandy wine, viz. &s;trong-water, to encourage them, which makes them as valiant as &s;o many Hectors; but the Cap|tains prove not right Alchymi&s;ts at all times; for that which they la&s;t admini&s;tred to the poor Sea-men, took not its full operation, but rather &s;truck a &s;pirit of Cow|ardize in them, as appears; Captain Peacock, Command|er of the Tyger, having received orders from Gen. Blake, to &s;cout forth, for making a di&s;covery of Vantrump, met with five Dutchmen, who hailing them, and commanding them to &s;trike &s;ail, they refu&s;ed; &s;o great is their impe|riou&s;ne&s;&s;e: whereupon he gave them one gun with a round ball, they an&s;wered in the like nature with three; in&s;omuch that a bloudy fight began, and for the &s;pace of four hours a hot di&s;pute was with great gallantry performed on both &s;ides; till at la&s;t it plea&s;ed the divine power, to make the Engli&s;h victorious, by finking one, and taking three, but not without lo&s;&s;e, yet not &s;o great as was &s;uppo&s;ed; for the truth is, our General much feared, that he had been either &s;unk or taken, by rea&s;on that he was mi&s;&s;ing three days; but upon the fourth day he returned with triumph, and brought in three Dutch prizes with him; we have taken in all about 44 &s;ail, yet many there are that &s;tick not to &s;ay, that Vantrump hath given the Eng|li&s;h a great overthrow, which maketh the Scots to re|joyce exceedingly, and &s;ay, that Common-wealths folks mu&s;t not reign always; neither mu&s;t the Common|wealth of England trample over the whole world, <HI>hut a|way hut,</HI> quoth the Scot, they mi&s;ken them&s;elves; Alas!

<HEAD>A Letter from Ireland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu may perceive by the Articles of Kilkenny; that all the Rebels in the &s;everal Provinces had time pre|fixed them for the accepting of tho&s;e conditions if they plea&s;ed, but Clanrickard and his party in Connaught, Grace, and his party in the Kings and Queens County, Collonel Phelim Birne and his party in Wexford and Wicklow, and Sir Phelim O Neal, with the O Relies, Mac Mahon, &amp;c. in Ul&s;ter, have wholly declared again&s;t the acceptance of the Articles; in order to which, the Lord of Clanrickard, with the Connaught Forces mar|ched to Balli&s;hanon about May 16, drew &s;ome Ordnance from Sligo, and battered two days, made abreach, and &s;tormed it, but was twice beaten of with co~&s;iderable lo&s;s, yet at length carried it. From thence he marched, and took Dongal Ca&s;tle, and the Ul&s;ter Forces joyned with him. This intelligence came to us the &s;econd in&s;tant, and brought us al&s;o a&s;&s;urance, that the Lord Pre&s;ident with the Connaught and Athlone forces marched to Balli&s;ha|non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n pro&s;ecution of the Lord Clanrickard, and was there about the 24 of May. That Col. Venables with the Ul&s;ter forces lay about Omagh, the Commi&s;&s;ary General marched towards Venables the 24 of May, with about 300 hor&s;e to &s;trengthen his party, and that the Legan men, headed by Col. Sander&s;on, had taken the pa&s;&s;ages upon Barns-moore to &s;top Clanrickards pa&s;&s;age into Ra|pha. So that you &s;ee, all the care and vigilancy po&s;&s;ible is taken to prevent Clanrickards return, and to fight him
<PB N="7" REF="4">with the Ul&s;ter men in the north, where I hope God hath brought them to judge and avenge upon them the inno|cent blood that was fir&s;t &s;hed in that Province. I doubt not, but by this time our forces are near an engagement with the Rebels, or that it is already done, and if &s;o, I am con&s;ident you will hear of it as &s;oon as we where we now lie. As for Grace, who&s;e force con&s;i&s;ted of about 1200 foot, and 400 hor&s;e, they have been (of late) &s;o hunted from place to place by Col. Sankey on the one &s;ide, and Col. Axtel on the other &s;ide, that to &s;ave them&s;elves they were forced to di&s;per&s;e, and &s;ome of his Officers (as well hor&s;e as foot) have come in, and &s;ubmitted and delivered up their arms. We hear al&s;o that We&s;tmeath, Slane, Dungan, Scurlogh, and others have laid down their arms in Lem&s;ter, of which I am &s;ure you have a more particu|lar information then we have.</P>
<P>It remains now that I give you the knowledge concer|ning the actings of the Lord Muskerry, which hath been tran&s;acted by the Commi&s;&s;ioners at Clonmel. He &s;ent the Commi&s;&s;ioners an ab&s;olute rejection of the Articles of Kilkenny, de&s;iring to have a Treaty entertained with him&s;elf. The Me&s;&s;enger that brought this, was Captain David Power of Kilholme, a man &s;ubtil enough to avoid the danger he &s;ell into, but that God that commonly takes the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s, led the Commi&s;&s;ioners to enquire why a man of his quality &s;hould be imployed about &s;o fruitle&s;s an errant. Whereupon further &s;earch being made, they found about him and his &s;ervant, &s;ome Letters to the Enemy of dangerous con&s;equence, and al|&s;o cyphers, and other papers, which his &s;afe conduct would not bear him out in, upon which he was commit|ted in order to his further trial, and an intimation of all was &s;ent to his Lord, the Lord Muskerry. After this, &s;ee|ing a further Treaty would not be granted him, he &s;ent a|nother
<PB N="8" REF="5">Me&s;&s;enger, intimating, that if he might him&s;elf have a&s;&s;urance for life, he would &s;ubmit with his party to the Parliaments mercy, and render the &s;trong hold of Ro&s;&s;e again into the Parl hand, with his other &s;trengths. This me&s;&s;age came from him on Sunday la&s;t, when the Lievt. Gen. was prepared to march into Kerry the Tue&s;|day following, with a party of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">00 foot, and 800 hor&s;e to reduce that County to the Parliaments obedience. Upon due debate and con&s;ideration, it was advi&s;ed to &s;end the Lord Muskerry a &s;afe guard for life (and accordingly acted) onely upon the condition afore&s;aid. Upon Wed|ne&s;day in the evening his me&s;&s;enger returned, and a&s;&s;ured us that his Lord&s;hip was &s;till con&s;tant to his fir&s;t re&s;olu|tion, but that &s;everal of his party had de&s;erted him, be|cau&s;e their lives were not &s;ecured as well as his, and that if the Lievt. Gen. marched up to him he would deliver Ro&s;s into his hands. This an&s;wer come to the Lievt. Gen. ve|&s;terday morning, whowe beleeve was then within 12 miles of the place, what the i&s;&s;ue is we know not, but when we receive it you &s;hall know it the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
