<OPENER><SALUTE>Endeared Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOurs of the 28 of July I received; in an&s;wer whereto, take this, This day came news to this place of a very great and hot Sea-fight, the manner was thus related. On the 30 in&s;tant the Dutch (after their long &s;tay about Tinmouth, and other parts thereabouts) were di&s;covered not very far from certain
<PB N="4" REF="3">I&s;lands called the Fern I&s;lands, they came with their &s;ails filled, Trumpets &s;ounding, Flaggs on Top-ma&s;t head, &s;hewing forth tokens of great re&s;olution; our Fleet di&s;|covering them, the Generall called a Councel, all unani|mou&s;ly agreed to fight them without delay, whereupon bearing up towards them, the Generall perceived the Dutch Admiral to &s;ingle out him&s;elf from the re&s;t, and &s;corning advantage of number, went forth alone to meet him, where valour appeared in its re&s;plendant brightne&s;s, above 40 broad &s;ides being exchanged between them: the Fleets on both &s;ides comming clo&s;e together, very de&s;pe|rately engaged each other, and manife&s;ted them&s;elves to be the &s;ons of Mars, &s;ighting with &s;uch re&s;olution, that &s;o terrible a Sea-&s;ight hath not been heard of in the re|membrance of any man, the di&s;coloured &s;ea &s;hewing the effects of their wrath. The Generall was exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, every one &s;eeking his ruine above the re&s;t; but Major Bourn, Capt. Peacock and divers others of our Fleet, &s;eeing him in &s;uch danger, made up to his relief, and &s;o plied the enemy with great and &s;mall &s;hot, that they were forced to tack about, to re&s;i&s;t the fury of tho&s;e fre&s;h a&s;&s;ailants, during this time the re&s;t of the Fleets were not idle but fought very re&s;olutely, as if they were re&s;ol|ved not to give over &s;o long as a &s;hip remained to float upon the Ocean.</P>
<P>The Generals on both &s;ides &s;trove to excell each other, and with their grapling Irons to board one another, but in vain, the Combatants on neither &s;ide giving way, &s;o that &s;mall &s;hot flew about as thick as Hail among them; at la&s;t the death of Vantrump (who was &s;een to fall on the Deck) &s;o di&s;couraged them, that di&s;pairing of victory, they endeavoured all they could to make away; but our men determining not to let them &s;o e&s;cape, &s;o be&s;tir|red them&s;elves, that they took about 54 of them, and
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;unk near upon 30, the re&s;t fled towards the Sound; our fleet are in pur&s;uit of them; our lo&s;&s;e is reported to be con&s;iderable, yet not &s;o much (we hope) as is related: it is &s;aid the Re&s;olution (in which was our Admirall) is &s;unk, with about thirteen or fourteen more, which lo&s;&s;e (though it be great) is far inferiour to theirs, the rather for that our General e&s;caped with mo&s;t of his Officers, in the boat; no doubt God hath re&s;erved him yet to do great things for the glory of his name, and the good of this Common-wealth.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Hamburgh, dated August <HI>3</HI> &s;tilo novo, <HI>1652.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived here &s;afely ye&s;terday the &s;econd in&s;tant, and finding now an opportunity, I thought good to acquit my &s;elf of my promi&s;e to you. The Swedes are making great preparations both by Sea and Land; at the late Randezvous or mu&s;tering, which u&s;ually is kept once a year, there were numbred twenty thou&s;and foot, and &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and the Crown &s;hips are in a very gal|lant Equipage. They kept a day of humiliation through the whole Country; but what their intentions are, is not yet known.</P>
<P>The Danes, their near Neighbours, begin to be jea|lous, and for that end provide for their own &s;ecurity as fa&s;t as they can, in mending their &s;hips, and fortifying their places upon their frontiers.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>At Stockholm there is expected &s;hortly Don E&s;tivan de Gamara as Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary for the King of Spain. Reports are likewi&s;e of one comming from Holland, but it is thought he will not be &s;o welcome as one from England, for the Hollanders are very jealous of a corre&s;pondency between the Parliament of England, and that Crown.</P>
<P>On the 28 of July there pa&s;&s;ed through this Town of Hambrough in great ha&s;te, an Expre&s;&s;e from the States of Holland, with &s;everal Letters to this and other Cities hereabouts. He goes on &s;peedily forward to Denmark and the Sound, to give notice in all parts, of the VVar commenced between that State and the Republick of En|gland and to require their aid.</P>
<P>The news of Poland, which for a long time was full of uncertainties and contradictions, according to the partial affections or di&s;affections of the Relators; begins now to appear a little more clear and certain, and time the mo|ther of Truth, hath di&s;covered &s;ince &s;everal particulars concerning the &s;tate of Affairs there, and the Author of all their mi&s;eries (according to my be&s;t intelligence) is found to be their own King; That he invited the Tartars to fall upon one part of the Army, which as it &s;eems was guided by the Nobles, and had refu&s;ed to comply with his ambitions de&s;igns, hoping by the removing of this ob|&s;tacle, to ma&s;ter the great ones, and to bring the Nobili|ty to his will: And as &s;oon as the news of this &s;laughter was brought, he cau&s;ed it to be noi&s;ed abroad through all parts of the Kingdome, &s;etting forth in &s;uch a nature, as if all were lo&s;t and undone, thereby to inveigle and a|ma&s;e the people, and to bring them to doubt of their own &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ety, that &s;o they might be brought to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their lives and E&s;tates, to work out his unlimited de&s;ires, and to entrap his Nobles and Great Ones whom he had
<PB N="7" REF="4">invited upon &s;o &s;udden an occa&s;ion, at the place of Ren|dezvouz, to con&s;ult about the pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition of the Affairs of the Kingdome; &s;ending out pittifull Letters and Declarations to all parts of his Command, as if that all would be de&s;troyed, ruined, and over-run by the approaching numerous Enemy, if they were not timely prevented; and that the Mu&s;covite on the one &s;ide, and the Turks on the other &s;ide, prepare and ha&s;ten to &s;e|cond the Tartars and Co&s;aggs: and therefore he intreats their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the good and delivery of the Kingdome, both of men and moneys, for which end he offers him&s;elf, and is willing to be made a Sacrifice for them.</P>
<P>But this his Plot being in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;covered, is oppo&s;ed by the greate&s;t per&s;ons in Poland, and it is like|ly will light very heavy upon his Maje&s;ty at the intended Dyet at War&s;ovia, to which u&s;ual place he is forced now to remove it from the &s;aid appointed Rendezvouz; It was to begin the 23 of July. What the Re&s;ults there|of will be, time will produce.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Town of Breme, &s;olicite hard, that they may remain a free Town of the Empire: But I beleeve their de&s;ires therein will never be granted. Sir, this is all at pre&s;ent from</P>
