<P>_THe village wherein the&s;e wonderfull and whole&s;ome Wells are, is called <HI>Horn|hau&s;en</HI> half a mile di&s;tant from <HI>A&s;hersle|ben</HI> and two miles from the City of <HI>Hal|ber&s;tadt,</HI> &s;tanding in a bottome or valley, betweene two little Hills, one towards the Ea&s;t, and the other towards the We&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting at this pre&s;ent not of above fifty Boores or tenants, whereas in former times there were at lea&s;t a hundred and fifty of them.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters name is <HI>Friderick Seligman;</HI> who was borne at <HI>Brun&s;wigg.</HI> There are now &s;ix Wells in the
<PB N="2" REF="3"> &s;aid Village, whereof but three are u&s;ed. The fir&s;t as be|ing the head &s;pring on the fifth day of <HI>March.</HI> 1646. and was di&s;covered by a youth comming from &s;choole who accidentally fell into it with one of his legs. He that fir&s;t of all dranke of it was one, that had beene troubled with an Ague for a long time, and in a very &s;hort time after he had drunke of it, he recovered. The &s;econd &s;pring on <HI>Mid&s;ummerday</HI> the 24. of <HI>Iune.</HI> And the third and fourth few dayes after. The fifth and &s;ixth on the even of our Ladyes Vi&s;itation, but e&s;pecially the &s;ixth, du|ring the time of publicke devotion. The fir&s;t is as large, as a round table the &s;econd and third halfe as large but they yeeld all three &s;uch a quantitie and aboundance of water, that it is a wonderfull &s;ight to all that have bin there. There is a di&s;tance of forty paces or thereabouts betweene each of the&s;e Wells. Concerning their ver|tues, effects and operations, it is certaine, that they are mo&s;t miraculous, and an&s;werable to the reportes that have bin noi&s;ed both within the Empire, and di&s;per&s;ed beyond Seas, It is mo&s;t true, that one Girle of <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> which was dumbe and deafe from her youth did reco|ver, &s;o that &s;he was beard of many, when &s;he &s;aid after with good &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding this pa&s;&s;age of the Scripture, <HI>The Blood of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t doth clean&s;e us from all our &s;ins.</HI> Likewi&s;e a certaine Man, who was blind, and u&s;ed to begge before the Gates at <HI>Leipzig,</HI> hath beene &s;eene of &s;ome within few dayes, te&s;tiying that he could &s;ee with one of his eyes all things, and full as well as any Man that is &s;harpe&s;ighted. In &s;umm, &s;uch wonderfull Cures happen every day, As the weekely thank&s;givings after the Sermon, doe give a &s;ufficient te|&s;timony of them.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P> Not long agoe, as wee are certainly informed, there hath been publick thanks-giving for the recovery of a hundred and twenty &s;even per&s;ons at once, whereof there were thirty &s;even that had the Falling &s;ickne&s;&s;e. And a woman with a crooked back, which &s;hee had twenty yeares. And la&s;t moneth there was another pub|lick thankes-giving &s;aid for foure&s;core per&s;ons, which were all cured of very &s;trange Di&s;ea&s;es and Infir|mities.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the three principall Wells are not of one ta&s;te, notwith&s;tanding they are of one colour; The fir&s;t is counted for the &s;weete&s;t, and for this rea&s;on, it cannot be tran&s;ported farre over land; The other is very &s;alt, having &s;ixe or eight Springs, with a &s;andy ground, not above a yard di&s;tant from a brooke; The third is of a middle ta&s;te between the fir&s;t and &s;econd. The water of the &s;econd is e&s;pecially good, and excellent for any outward hurts and &s;ores. There are many that have been re&s;tored to their former &s;ight (as the publick thanks|givings for them doth te&s;tifie) which had lo&s;t their &s;ights quite by the &s;mall pox; And we received but ju&s;t now Letters from the Schoolema&s;ter there that informe us that already &s;ix hundred &s;icke bodies, of &s;everall di&s;ea&s;es, were recovered by drinking of the &s;aid Wells for the &s;pace of eight or nine dayes. Certainly tho&s;e that have been there pre&s;ent relate, that Gods wonder|full workes, might, power, mercy and goodne&s;&s;e is evi|dently to be &s;eene there, in the&s;e infirme and di&s;ea&s;ed Creatures, which by the drinking of this precious Wa|ter, were made whole, e&s;pecially that were afflicted with the&s;e &s;ickne&s;&s;es following. As with the Gout, Feavers, Agues, Deafne&s;&s;e, French pox, Crook-backs,

<P>Moreover, there are at this pre&s;ent above five thou|&s;and per&s;ons come there, of all &s;orts, ranke and condi|tion from all parts of <HI>Germanie,</HI> as <HI>Nuenberg, Au|&s;purg, Munchen, Hanburg, Bremen, Stetin, &amp;c.</HI> with a world of Coaches and Wagons; &s;o that Travellers &s;ometimes find difficultie to be furni&s;hed with Hor&s;es. His Highne&s;&s;e the Prince Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> with his Mother and Aunt, Her Maje&s;ty the Queene of <HI>Sweden,</HI> are gone thither; And wee are informed that Generall <HI>Tor&s;ten&s;on,</HI> (who by rea&s;on of his indi&s;po&s;iti|on in his body, was con&s;trained to re&s;igne his Com|mand to <HI>Wrangel)</HI> went thither in a Litter, and came a|way on hor&s;e-back fully recovered.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we are of late informed, that by Gods infi|nite power and mercy tho&s;e three principall Wells are multiplied and di&s;per&s;ed into fifteene all at a di&s;tance of fourty paces one from another. They write al&s;o, that
<PB N="5" REF="4"> the Phy&s;itians have di&s;tilled the &s;ame Water, and found pure gold thereby. It is to be feared, that if men &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with the grace and mercy of God, that God &s;hall withdraw his ble&s;&s;ing, and turne it into a judgement. And for the obtaining of Gods ble&s;&s;ing, at &s;et houres in the morning, at eight of the clocke, and in the evening at 3, prayers are duly and con&s;tantly per|formed in the pre&s;ence of &s;o many thou&s;and per&s;ons who altogether fall downe upon their knees, praying with the Mini&s;ter after this manner following.</P>

<P>_ALmighty God, mercifull Father, wee thy weake, di&s;ea&s;ed, infirme and mi&s;erable chil|dren doe appeare here with &s;ad, afflicted, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed countenances before thy mo&s;t holy throne of Grace, bowing the knees of our hearts, acknowledging and lamenting our manifold enormous &s;innes and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, wherewith we have &s;inned again&s;t thee, O mo&s;t righteous God, provoked thy wrath, which is like the burning and con&s;uming fire, and drawne upon our &s;elves, all &s;orts of judgements and plagues; &s;o that thou ha&s;t not onely vi&s;ited us with the Sword Per&s;ecution, Dearth and other puni&s;h+ments, but al&s;o ha&s;t cha&s;tened&punc; handled and afflicted our bodyes with &s;everall Di&s;ea&s;es, Sores and Infirmities, and thereby ha&s;t fulfilled, wherewith thou ha&s;t threatned us in thy Word long agoe; that who|&s;oever &s;inneth again&s;t his Creatour, &s;hall fall into the hands of the Phy&s;itian.

Many &s;uch, blind, lame, and other infirme bodies were gathered together at the Poole of <HI>Be|the&s;da,</HI> which waited on till the water was moved by the Angell, that then they might de&s;cend into it and bee healed.

O Lord grant this Fountaine may yeeld water in abundance, with a con&s;tant and durable vertue, that there|by our mi&s;erable and weake bodies may receive comfort and helpe, and thy name be exalted and magnified throughout all Nations.
