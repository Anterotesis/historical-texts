<HEAD>A LETTER From AMSTERDAM To <HI>M. C.</HI> in <HI>LONDON.</HI> Di&s;covering the taking of Sr. Thomas Arm&s;trong With the narrow E&s;cape of My Lord <HI>Gray</HI> and Mr. <HI>Eergu&s;on</HI> at LEYDEN IN HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WE live in an Age not over prone to admire and take notice of any In&s;tances of Divine Providence either in our Pre&s;ervation from dangers, our Deli|verance out of them, or our falling into them, for &s;o great is the &s;ecurity of &s;ome Men that they are unwilling to apprehend any danger till they fall into it, and if they e&s;cape for a time will hardly believe that they were ever in it.</P>
<P>Such is the Ca&s;e of this ungrateful Rebel, an Arch Traytor, Sir <HI>Tho. Arm&s;trong,</HI> who having e&s;caped the hands of Ju&s;tice for a time thought him&s;elf &s;ecure, but the hand of Providence that has in Mercy protected our mo&s;t Gracious Soveraign from all Wicked Devices, hath at la&s;t in Ju&s;tice lay'd hold on this de&s;perate Renegade, and will in time bring him to ju&s;t and Exemplary Pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The nature and manner of his being taken, being then my &s;elf at <HI>Leydon</HI> the &s;ame day, I will Di&s;cover as &s;hort as I can.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI> with the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> hav|ing lain &s;ome Months at <HI>Berlin</HI> &amp; being &s;u&s;pected upon the ac|count of their Privacy, we had notice &s;ent by <HI>Juan van Farrenberg,</HI> at who&s;e Hou&s;e they then lay, of &s;ome &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB REF="2">Men, that had lain in his Hou&s;e for &s;ome time by the name of <HI>Bowman, Bethel</HI> and <HI>Jekiel.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chudly,</HI> his Maje&s;ties Envoy at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> having notice thereof made his Application to the States for a Warrant to &s;eize them which was granted, but before they got to <HI>Berlin</HI> (whe|ther they had private Information or their Fears &s;ugge&s;ted) they were remov'd, and got to <HI>Bremond,</HI> there they &s;tayed a while, and might have &s;tayed longer had not their zeal or curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> engaged them to take a Pil|gramage into <HI>Fanders.</HI></P>
<P>After this they came to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where having &s;upply'd them|&s;elves with Trowling Money (for the Bully at this time had thrown away his fal&s;e Dice) they went to <HI>Leyden</HI> which is 12 miles from <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>Here they had not been 3 days when the Envoy having again notice of it procur'd a Warrant for the &s;ecureing of them. Whither they had any Information, or &s;u&s;pected any thing, the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> and <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> made their e&s;capes. But Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI> re&s;olving to Dye upon the &s;pot before he was taken ad|ventured to &s;tay longer.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons &s;ent to &s;eize him, being &s;o Commanded by the En|voy, were re&s;olved to take him if po&s;&s;ible alive. For which Cau&s;e they made no attempt upon his Lodging, but having notice, he was to go by Water, they po&s;ted them&s;elves for his Reception at the place where he was to take Boat. Where after they had wait|ed 4 days, at la&s;t they &s;pyed him coming, who was no &s;ooner in the Boat but 4 of them leapt in after him and the re&s;t in another Boat &s;o &s;ecur'd him that he cou'd neither do them nor him&s;elf any preju|dice, though he &s;everal times declar'd he wou'd &s;onner be kill'd then taken, drew out his Knife to Stab him&s;elf, and attempted &s;e|veral times to throw him&s;elf over Board.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured and prevented him from doing any mi&s;|cheif to him&s;elf, they &s;oon made to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where one of his Maje&s;ties Yats was ready to receive them. On Board of which he is now coming to <HI>London</HI> fa&s;t bound in Chains for fear of doing Violence to him&s;elf, where you may expect him in a &s;hort time, and it is expected the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> and <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> will follow in a few days after, they being now in clo&s;e &s;earch of them.</P>
