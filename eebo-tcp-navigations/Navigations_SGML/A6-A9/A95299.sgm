<HEAD>A True Relation Of the Siege of BELGRADE, With the Taking it by Storm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>BElgrade</HI> is a City of Antient &s;tanding and great Fame, Situate on the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save,</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> and hath gone under divers Names; being at fir&s;t, as far as can be ga|thered from Hi&s;tory, called, <HI>Taururum,</HI> or <HI>Tauranum;</HI> after that, <HI>Alba Graeca;</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> accordingly, <HI>Greichs-We&s;&s;em|burg;</HI> but by the <HI>French</HI> and Modern Latini&s;ts, <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and <HI>Belgradum;</HI> a Name given to this Important place for its Beautiful Situation, as being Hemm'd in upon the <HI>North</HI> with the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> with the <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save,</HI> and on the other parts &s;trongly &s;ecured with Walls, Bulwarks, Ramports, and deep Ditches, anciently belonging to the De|&s;pots or Princes of <HI>Servia,</HI> tho lying on the very Frontiers of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and by many Attributed a City of that Kingdom,
<PB N="2" REF="3">and may properly be divided into City and Suburbs; the Former having &s;tanding in it a very high and &s;trong Ca&s;tle, incompa&s;&s;ed with double Walls, and what other Fortifications may contribute to its Defence. The Latter Repleni&s;hed with many goodly Fabricks, and curious Buildings, inter|mixed with plea&s;ant Gardens, and has a pro&s;pect of the Countries round it, almo&s;t from <HI>Buda</HI> to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> and of &s;uch Importance was it in times pa&s;t, That in <HI>Anno</HI> 1440. <HI>Amurath</HI> the Second Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after he had wa&s;ted <HI>Hungary,</HI> and &s;eized upon <HI>Servia</HI> (during the Di&s;contents and Inte&s;tine Broils of tho&s;e Countries) found neverthele&s;s a check or &s;top to the progre&s;s of his Arms before this City; for having layn before it Seven Months, and lo&s;t in the &s;everal Attacques and Sallies of the Be&s;ieged 30000 Men; finding all hopes of taking it vain, he in a great Rage rai&s;ed the Siege, and returned to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> &s;o that the place had re&s;t till <HI>Anno</HI> 1456, at what time <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great being Em|peror of the <HI>Turks,</HI> he upon the Death of <HI>George</HI> the De&s;pot or Prince, &s;eized upon <HI>Servia,</HI> which <HI>Amurath</HI> had permit|ted to be held by that Prince as Tributary to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em|peror; and pa&s;&s;ing on with a powerful Army, all the Cities and Towns but this opening their Gates, he laid Siege to it by Land and Water, and brought down a great many Ve&s;&s;els and Gallies of War upon the <HI>Danube;</HI> though at that time the great <HI>Hunniades</HI> having been Elected King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and not well brooking to have &s;o powerful a Neighbour, &s;et out from <HI>Buda</HI> with many armed Ve&s;&s;els, and falling &s;udden|ly upon the <HI>Turks</HI> Naval Forces, Burn'd, Sunk, and took mo&s;t of them; upon notice whereof, <HI>Mahomet</HI> in a great Rage gave order for a general A&s;&s;ault, Vowing not to &s;pare, nor give Quarter to any, if the City of <HI>Belgrade</HI> fell into his Hands; and after Six hours ob&s;tinate Attempts, in which were lo&s;t 4000. Men, one whereof was <HI>Curaizis Ba&s;&s;a</HI> his Lieute|nant in <HI>Europe,</HI> who was &s;lain with a great Shot, he found
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">him&s;elf con&s;trained to &s;ound the Retreat; and in the End, after many un&s;ucce&s;sful A&s;&s;aults, finding his Army weakened by the lo&s;s of 40000 Men, he rai&s;ed the Siege. From which time we find nothing Memorable relating to this City, till the Year 1520, at which time <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent &s;uc|ceeding <HI>Solyman</HI> his Father in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Throne, quarrel|ing with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> (into who&s;e Protection <HI>Belgrade</HI> was taken, con&s;ign'd by the De&s;pot of <HI>Servia</HI> to King <HI>Sigi&s;|mund,</HI> as be&s;t able to Maintain it, in con&s;ideration of Lands and Territories more remote) he laid Siege to it, being but weakly Garri&s;on'd, and wor&s;e provided with Stores and Ammunition; and the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> by rea&s;on of Inte|&s;tine Divi&s;ions, being in no Capacity to rai&s;e an Army &s;uffi|cient to Relieve it, the Be&s;ieged found them&s;elves (after a &s;hort Re&s;i&s;tance) con&s;trained to deliver up the place that had &s;o long &s;tood the Bulwark of Chri&s;tendom, and has ever &s;ince been very advantageous to the Turks, by being made their chiefe&s;t Magazine or Store in the We&s;tern parts of their Empire; and although the Chri&s;tians had many Con&s;ulta|tions about Recovering it, yet &s;oon after <HI>Buda</HI> being &s;eized by the &s;ame <HI>Solyman,</HI> and other places of &s;trong Importance, the <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it quietly till this pre&s;ent year 1688, when on the Sixth of <HI>September</HI> after, having &s;u&s;tained a Siege very Bloody and Re&s;olute, it was taken by Storm by the Imperial Forces, under the Command of the Victorious Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> A True and Impartial Account of which take as followeth.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by rea&s;on of his Indi&s;po&s;ition, not being capable to take the Field &s;o early as the occa&s;ion of bu|&s;ine&s;s required, his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> offered his Service to the Emperor to lead the Army, which being accepted and approved, after the Forces were drawn out of their Winter Quarters and united, the Elector Arrived at
<PB N="4" REF="4"><HI>Vienna;</HI> and there making a &s;hort &s;tay, proceeded to his Command, when in a Council of War it was re&s;olved, That &s;eeing <HI>Buda</HI> was already reduced, and Heaven &s;ignally favour'd the Chri&s;tian Arms, it was not convenient to omit the opportunity of Be&s;ieging &s;o Important a place the Infidels held, <HI>viz. Belgrade;</HI> whereupon the Army had order to March towards the <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save;</HI> &s;o that on the Fourth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> New Stile, they &s;et forward from <HI>Salankamen</HI> to <HI>Ze|mon,</HI> where they &s;tayed the next day; and the Sixth Encam|ped at <HI>Semlyn;</HI> on the Seventh they came within Sight of the River, where it makes the con&s;iderable I&s;lands of <HI>Zingari;</HI> when coming to the hither Bank, they perceived by rea&s;on of the Works the <HI>Turks</HI> had ca&s;t up in the I&s;lands, where <HI>Teckely</HI> was &s;aid to be in Per&s;on, and on the further Shore, it was a matter of great difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to pa&s;s there, as had been before de&s;igned, being much broader than it had been Repre&s;ented; &s;o that &s;ome time being &s;pent a|bout viewing, and further con&s;ulting what was to be done, another place was fixed upon, and accordingly (the next day) a great number of Boats that had been brought thither up|on Wheels, were put into the Water, and the Regiment of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> the Electors Guards, and four Thou&s;and Men, Detached out of other Bodies, were ordered to Waft over, under the Command of the Valiant, and truly Heroick, Count <HI>Serini,</HI> General of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces; when about Nine at Night, the Drums and Hautboys of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> were heard in the Camp, as &s;eeming to approach the place of pa&s;&s;age; but it &s;o little di&s;couraged the Imperiali&s;ts, that about Eleven at Night, the Foot were Embarqued, and the Elector directed that 500 Men, under the Command of a Lieutenant Colonel, &s;hould Land fir&s;t to ob&s;erve the place; but &s;carce were they in the Middle of the River, but about 300 <HI>Turks</HI> appeared on the further Shore, and di&s;charged a Volley of Shot, but without doing any dammage to the Chri|&s;tians;
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">who, after this di&s;charge, ha&s;tened to Land under the favour of the Cannon Planted to Annoy the Enemy; &s;o that thereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> quitted their Po&s;t; where the Land|ing place and ground was found as well as could rea&s;onably be wi&s;hed, being very Commodious, by rea&s;on about four paces from the Bank of the River were almo&s;t Inacce&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the Bu&s;hes and Woody places; &s;o that the Boats left tho&s;e they carried over in Security, and returned; when about Four in the Morning, 3000 were got over, covering and Intrenching them&s;elves, to prevent any Attempt or Sur|prize the Evening might make upon them, who now ap|proached in con&s;iderable Numbers; and whil&s;t the Foot thus continued to pa&s;s over in Boats, the Bridge was laid for the Hor&s;e; however, before it could be Fini&s;hed, 6000 of the Enemies Foot, and &s;ome Hor&s;e, Attacqued the Chri&s;tians on the further Shoar, on the Right and the Left; but, after &s;e|veral A&s;&s;aults, were Repul&s;ed with a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s; the Chri&s;tians lo&s;ing a Major of the Regiment of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> with divers Granadeers that were too far advanced; when about Eleven of the Clock, 10000 Men had effectually pa&s;|&s;ed the River; and then the Enemy appeared again with a greater force, within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, but made no farther at|tempt; and &s;oon after, a <HI>Hungarian</HI> Di&s;&s;enter, Informed the General, That the Enemy the Night following, intended to make an Attacque with their whole Power; but about Five in the Evening (the Bridge being entirely fini&s;hed) a Regi|ment of Dragoons pa&s;&s;ed it, and after them, the Foot that remained, and about Midnight, the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that on the Ninth of <HI>August,</HI> the whole Army, with the Artillery and Baggage, Encamped on the further Shore, with|in four Leagues of <HI>Belgrade;</HI> where his Electoral Highne&s;s was Informed, That there was a Garri&s;on of 12000 <HI>Turks,</HI> and 3000 <HI>Tartars</HI> in the City, but without any certainty; and that <HI>Yeghen Ba&s;&s;a</HI> lay Entrenched with the re&s;t of the
<PB N="6" REF="5"><HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, between the <HI>Save</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> to cover the place; but being nothing di&s;mayed at this Report, his Electoral Highne&s;s Commanded the Army on the Tenth to March towards the City, in order to Battle, re&s;olving to Attacque the Enemy in their Camp; when, contrary to ex|pectation, they found it abandoned, and the Suburbs or lower Town on Fire, the <HI>Turks</HI> that Inhabited it, having &s;aved them&s;elves in the Boats belonging to the City; yet four of them were taken with a con&s;iderable Booty, and the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> being &s;ent out in a flying Party after the Retreating Enemy, took much of their Baggage, and &s;ome Thou&s;ands of great and &s;mall Cattle; when upon the near approach of the Army, 4000 <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;cians,</HI> with their Wives and Children, came to meet them, and to Implore his Electoral Highne&s;&s;es Protection, which they obtained; &s;trict Orders being given throughout the Camp, that none under great Penalties and Puni&s;hment, &s;hould pre&s;ume to di&s;turb or mole&s;t them; how|ever, the Soldiers having quenched the Fire, after it had Burnt &s;everal hundred Hou&s;es, found a con&s;iderable Booty the <HI>Turks</HI> in their ha&s;t and confu&s;ion had left behind them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> thus uncontrouled approaching the Walls of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> Scouts were &s;ent out to learn the Motion and Intent of the Enemy, who returned with an Account, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, the Sera&s;quier of <HI>Hungary,</HI> together with <HI>Yeck|ley,</HI> was retired to <HI>Sendrovia,</HI> about Eight Leagues further, with 20000 Men under his Command: And upon further Inquiry, it was confidently reported, That no more than 4000 Men were left in the Ca&s;tle or upper Fortre&s;s, under the Command of a Governor, who had lately been a common Soldier: And further, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> would have Fought the Army, but was di&s;&s;waded from it by the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Erla</HI> or <HI>Agria,</HI> and &s;ome other Principal Officers; Three of which (in a great Fury) he cut in pieces with his own hand, and cau&s;ed the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Agria</HI> to be Strangled in his
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y">pre&s;ence; the former Ba&s;&s;a, Governour of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> making his E&s;cape, to avoid his Fury; as al&s;o did <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, his Competitor.</P>
<P>Upon the day of Arrival before the place, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> cau&s;ed the Trenches to be opened again&s;t the Upper Town and Ca&s;tle, and di&s;patched the Sieur <HI>Dietrick,</HI> Captain of Hor&s;e, and Adjutant to General <HI>Caprara,</HI> with Letters to <HI>Vienna,</HI> giving the Emperor an account of the Succe&s;s, and lodged him&s;elf in the Plea&s;ure-Hou&s;e, built without the Town, for the Reception of the Depo&s;ed <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> when he came to View the Mu&s;ter of his Army that (under the Leading of <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha</HI> the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI>) Be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna, Anno</HI> 1683. where he had News, that the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> after Three hours ob&s;tinate Fight, had overthrown the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;na</HI>'s Army, compo&s;ed of between 12 and 14000 Men, po&s;ted to hinder his Pa&s;&s;age over the River <HI>&V;na,</HI> Killing Four Thou&s;and on the Place; upon which, <HI>Con&s;tan|towitza</HI> had Surrendred, a Place of con&s;iderable Importance on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>Things being at this pa&s;s, Preparations were made (with much caution and diligence) to Attack the Ca&s;tle; the Management or Conduct of which, was left to Count <HI>Serini,</HI> Lieutenant General to His Electoral Highne&s;s, the Walls whereof the Elector had Viewed, and given Orders, where he perceived it mo&s;t advantageous for the Attacks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And although the <HI>Turks</HI> Sallyed at the &s;ame time, yet were they beaten back, with the lo&s;s of but One Man on the part of the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, being the Twelfth, in the Evening the Troops' began to Approach the Ca&s;tle, and to take their Po&s;ts; to hinder which, the Enemy made a Vigorous Sally, &s;o that the Skirmi&s;h continued Three or Four hours, but at la&s;t they were Repul&s;ed; and in this Action Eighty of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were Killed and Wounded, the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="6">a greater Number: And &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful it proved, that the for|mer &s;ecured, under the favour of this Action, their Po&s;ts, and opened the Frenches within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the Walls, and began to work on Two Batteries.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth in the Morning, the Be&s;ieged made ano|ther Sally in a greater Body than the former, breaking on up|on the Be&s;iegers, and came to Handy-blows, in which Di&s;|pute Count <HI>Rabntine,</HI> General of the Battalia, was &s;hot in the Arm, Count <HI>Ta&s;&s;is,</HI> Serjeant Major of the Regiment of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in the Body, and &s;everal other private Soldiers were Killed and Wounded; but the Be&s;iegers being pre&s;ently re|inforced, the Be&s;ieged were beaten back, many of them being Slain and Wounded, of which 500 were left behind Dead, and two taken Pri&s;oners; who Reported, That there were Ten Thou&s;and Per&s;ons in the Garri&s;on, but many of them Women and Children, which was confirmed by a Chri&s;tian Slave, who had been there &s;ince the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and now made his e&s;cape to the Army; when the &s;ame day, News came, That <HI>Yeghen Ba&s;&s;a</HI> had &s;et the Famous City of <HI>Seman|dra</HI> on Fire, which was about &s;even Leagues from the Camp, and carried the Inhabitants to <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> continuing his Retreat in great di&s;order towards <HI>Sofia.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Enemies Cannon Played &s;uriou&s;ly, and they threw a great many Granado's and Bombs, but did no con&s;iderable Execution; and after that, made ano|ther Sally, though with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former; and the &s;ame day a Detachment of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Teme&s;|ware</HI> got by the help of Boats into the Ca&s;tle, on that part that &s;tands to the River <HI>Danube,</HI> though the number was not con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Be&s;ieged had fini&s;hed a Bat|tery of three Mortars, and &s;hot a great many Carca&s;&s;es and Bombs into the place, doing con&s;iderable Execution; and the Elector ordered, that a Lieutenant General, a Serjeant-Major,
<PB N="9" REF="6">and Two Colonels, with 800 Hor&s;e, and 3000 Foot &s;hould Nightly Guard the Trenches; where, the bet|ter to Incourage the Workmen, His Electoral Highne&s;s con|tinued frequently till One or Two in the Morning.</P>
<P>On the Sixteenth, the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> arrived, and made his Entrance into the Camp with a numerous Train, and &s;plendid Equipage, having with him above 500 Men on Hor&s;e-back, including his Guards, 40 lead Hor&s;es, 24 Mules, and 25 Waggons with Baggage, and a Coach of State drawn by Six Hor&s;es, and followed by many other Coaches, and a great many Servants in Liveries; and upon his ap|proach, was met by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> accompanied by the Chief Officers, about a Mile from the Camp, and thence conducted to the Head Quarters, where they Dined together, and afterward went to vi&s;it the Trenches, when in the mean time, his Tents to the number of 104, &s;ome of them very Rich, were pitched between the Electors Quarters, and that of General <HI>Caprara;</HI> and in the Even|ing the Be&s;ieged made a Sally with a greater Body than formerly, but found the Trenches &s;o &s;trongly Guarded, that they were obliged to Retreat with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>On the Seventeenth, by break of day, the Be&s;iegers be|gan to Batter the Walls of the Ca&s;tle with Six Pieces of Ca|non, and under&s;tood by a De&s;erter, that the Enemy were hard at work in their Mines; and in the Evening, General <HI>Caprara,</HI> being with his Electoral Highne&s;s in the Trenches, to give nece&s;&s;ary directions, and encourage tho&s;e that were working, a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot pa&s;&s;ed through his Hat and Peruke, without doing him any further damage.</P>
<P>On the Eighteenth the Enemies Cannon and Small-&s;hot played very &s;martly, &s;o that Count <HI>Gallenfells,</HI> a Colonel of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> being in the Trenches, received a Wound in the Body with a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, and Lieutenant Colonel Count <HI>Lambert,</HI> another in the Head, and the young Count <HI>De
<PB N="10" REF="7">Traun</HI> had his Arm &s;hot off, and under the favour of their Canon the Enemy Sallyed, but were &s;oon beaten back.</P>
<P>On the Nineteenth, the Trenches were carried on with great diligence, in&s;omuch that the Workmen run them within ten paces of the Ditch, though not without &s;ome con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition, and great lo&s;s of Men, but not any of Note; &s;o that now they began to rai&s;e two new Batteries, and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and General <HI>Ca|prara,</HI> continuing all Night in the Trenches, the better to encourage &s;o important a Work.</P>
<P>On the Twentieth, the Be&s;iegers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> or <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Church, on the brink of the Ditch, which the Be&s;ieged upon their approach abandoned, and ha&s;tened to the Ca&s;tle with great precipitation; how|ever, one le&s;s nimble than the re&s;t was taken, who declared upon Examination, there were 5000 <HI>Janizaries</HI> in the Town and Ca&s;tle, and that the Commanding Ba&s;&s;a encouraged the Garri&s;on with a&s;&s;urance of Relief, promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, not to &s;uffer things to come to Extremity, though no great &s;tre&s;s was laid upon this Report; &s;o that the Canon and Bombs continued to play furiou&s;ly on both &s;ides, where by one of the Shells the Prince <HI>D'Comercy</HI> received a Con|tu&s;ion or Brui&s;e on the Arm, and the Sieur <HI>Claudio Martelli,</HI> Adjutant General to the Army, a Wound in the Head; and although many others of le&s;&s;er Note were Wounded, yet but one Man was killed.</P>
<P>On the One and Twentieth, two Parallel Lines were drawn on the Right and the Left, to compa&s;s a greater &s;pace of Ground, as well on the &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, as the Town, and two Redoubts made to &s;upport the Heads of them, which were performed in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition the Enemy made, doing all they could with their Canon and Bombs, to en|damage the Workmen, and hinder the Proceedings.</P>

<P>On the Twenty Second, the Be&s;iegers having per|fected the Works, the great Canon and Mortars Arrived from <HI>Buda;</HI> upon which, Orders were given to Batter the Ca&s;tle from Two Batteries, one of Fourteen Pieces, and the other of Twelve: And a De&s;erter that came into the Camp, reported, <HI>That the Ba&s;&s;a had cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable Officer to be Hanged, on the Fifteenth, for offering to &s;peak of a Sur|render: And that he gave, for their better Incouragement, a Duccate to every Man that would venture to make a Sally:</HI> And about this Time other Scouts that had been &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the Motion of <HI>Yeghen Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> returned, having been as far as <HI>Sendrovia,</HI> and made their Report, that the Ca&s;tle and Town were quite de&s;troyed by Fire, but the Walls are &s;tanding; and that the <HI>Turks</HI> left Twenty Pieces of Canon behind them for ha&s;t, or want of conveniency to carry them off. They likewi&s;e brought with them a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> who had made his E&s;cape out of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, confirming, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> Ba&s;&s;a was retired to <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> about Twenty Leagues from <HI>Belgrade,</HI> burning the Country, and carrying the People along with him; &s;o that care was taken to fetch off the Canon left at <HI>Seudrovia;</HI> And then it was Rumoured, that a great many Families of <HI>Ra&s;cians</HI> had offered to Re-edifie and Inhabit that Ancient City, if they might be Protected by an Imperial Gari&s;on.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Third, the Be&s;iegers batter'd the Ca&s;tle very &s;uriou&s;ly, which is Built after the Ancient way of For|tifying, with Towers, Battlements, Double-Walls, and con|&s;iderable Ditches; however, the Canon made divers Breaches, and beat down part of the Fortifications; and although the Be&s;ieged Sallyed, with an Intent to Attack the Redoubts, they were beaten in again, leaving a con&s;i|derable number of their Party dead behind them. And about this Time it was further confirmed, that the Prince of
<PB N="12" REF="8"><HI>Baden</HI> had routed the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> and Killed 3000 Men. Moreover, <HI>Debitza, Je&s;&s;uewitz,</HI> and <HI>Gradiska</HI> being fir&s;t &s;et on Fire, were Abandoned by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were retired towards <HI>Banyalucca,</HI> whither the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> follow'd them: As al&s;o that General <HI>Veterani</HI> had Taken <HI>Carau&s;ebes,</HI> and the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salancar:</HI> And now the Canon Playing &s;uriou&s;ly from the Batteries; the Engineers (though they were rai&s;ed as high as they could bare) found &s;ome Ob|&s;truction, by rea&s;on of the Ruinous Hou&s;es that had been con&s;umed by the Fire, or &s;hatter'd by the force of the Bombs and Canon; whereupon the Miners received Or|ders to Overthrow them: in which they were &s;o Expedi|tious and &s;ucce&s;sful, that the Be&s;ieged were laid more open to the force of Twenty Six Pieces of Canon, though the Be&s;ieged were not Idle but made very Vigorous Sallies, as long as they could, Playing their Canon, Bombs, and &s;mall Shot without Intermi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that many were Killed on both &s;ides, and &s;ome Wounded; among&s;t the latter was Count <HI>D' Ligneville,</HI> Collonel of Foot, and Adjutant Gene|ral, wounded by a Shot in the Trenches, whither he was come to give nece&s;&s;ary Orders; and although he was car|ried off, yet &s;oon after he Died of the Wound.</P>
<P>The&s;e being the Actions pa&s;&s;ing the Twenty Third and Twenty Fourth, and the heavy Canon being all mounted on the Batteries; whil&s;t they were Thundring again&s;t the Walls, a Letter was brought and Pre&s;ented to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> from <HI>O&s;man</HI> Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aleppo;</HI> the Tenure of which, together with His Electoral Highne&s;&s;es An&s;wer, take as followeth:</P>

<P>Upon the return of this An&s;wer to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aleppo</HI>'s Letter, General <HI>Caraffa</HI> received Orders to go to <HI>Titul,</HI> to meet the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, and to hear what they had to Propo&s;e; and in the mean while the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to acquaint the Emperor that a <HI>Chiaux</HI> was

<P>On the Twenty Fifth, the great Canon being Arrived, and the Batteries were Intirely fixed, the Be&s;iegers po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed them&s;elves under the favour of them of another <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> very advantageou&s;ly Scituate, to &s;helter them in the ad|vancing their Works, whil&s;t the Miners Lodged them&s;elves at the Foot of the Wall, and made Lodgments for their Powder.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Sixth, the Batteries again&s;t the Ca&s;tle Playing furiou&s;ly, beat down the Top of the Round-Tower, which fell into the Ditch, doing damage to the Battlements, and other Works in its Fall; and the better to forward this good Succe&s;s, Fifteen Mortars were placed mo&s;t advanta|geou&s;ly on the &s;ides of the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">ries that were the mo&s;t ad|vanced, in order to ca&s;t Bomb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the Ca&s;tle and Town.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Seventh the Canon and Mortars Play'd very furiou&s;ly, by who&s;e continual Thundering, a con&s;i|derable Breach was made in the Wall, at what Time the Be&s;ieged &s;prung a Mine near the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> of which the Be&s;iegers made them&s;elves the la&s;t Ma&s;ters; which, though it did not Blow up, yet rendered it u&s;ele&s;s, and Wounded di|vers Men that were in and near it.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Eighth, The Be&s;ieged &s;prung another Mine, de&s;igning thereby to Ruine the main Advance Bat|tery of the Be&s;iegers; but Blowing up &s;hort, it only &s;hook
<PB N="16" REF="10">it, without any Demoli&s;hment; yet the Thunder-crack was &s;o great, that it occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable Di&s;order, and was Increa&s;ed by one of the Be&s;ieged's Bombs, &s;etting Fire to &s;everal Quintals of Powder, which blew up Seven or Eight Men that were on the Battery; which the Be|&s;ieged perceiving, made a Sally with about an Hundred Men, coming on the Right and Left of the Head of the Trenches, but found the Guards there in &s;o good a Po&s;ture, that being warmly received (after &s;ome Di&s;pute) they were beaten back, with the lo&s;s of Twelve of their Men, who were Killed at the fir&s;t Volley of Shot di&s;charged upon them: And this day Two <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> made their E&s;cape out of the Place, to the Camp; and declared, That the Garri&s;on was between Three and Four Thou&s;and &s;trong, that they were very diligent in Mining, to meet the Approaches of the Be&s;iegers; and that the Governor, who&s;e Name was <HI>Ibraim,</HI> a&s;&s;ured them there was a Powerful Army coming to their Relief; Incouraging them, in the Expectation thereof, to make a re&s;olute Defence.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Ninth, His Electoral Highne&s;s &s;ent a Captain, with an Interpreter, to Summon the Be&s;ieged to a Surrender of the Town and Ca&s;tle, &s;eeing they could have no hopes, or the lea&s;t expectation of Succour; which the Governor &s;o highly re&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> that (contrary to the Rules or Articles of War) he cau&s;ed the Interpreter, who was a <HI>Grecian,</HI> to be Hanged, and Impri&s;oned the Captain. The Night following, the Be&s;iegers Engineers &s;et Fire to the Be&s;ieged's Pali&s;ado's, and thereupon a Detachment of not Men were ordered to advance, and make a Lodgment in the Ditch; but the Be&s;ieged, by the light of this Fire, &s;o well directed and levelled their Shot, that 100 of the Party were Killed, a great many Wounded, and the re&s;t obliged to retire, notwith&s;tanding the Fire &s;o ruined the Pali&s;ado's, that being within the reach of the Shot from the Trenches, the Be&s;ieged could not Repair them.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10" MS="y">
<P>On the Thirtieth, The Fury of the Canon had very much enlarged the Breach; but however, it was not judged open enough for an A&s;&s;ault, and the Miners having run a Mine to the Corner of one of the large&s;t Towers on the Wall, and heightning Them&s;elves in expectation of the great u&s;e they might make of it, found them&s;elves di&s;appointed by a Countermine made again&s;t them by the Be&s;ieged, into which they unadvi&s;edly fell, and were &s;o annoyed with Granado's and combu&s;tible Matter that was Fired, to put a &s;top to their Progre&s;s, that to avoid the danger and the &s;tench, they found them&s;elves con&s;trained to retire towards the opening of their own Mine, with &s;ome Lo&s;s: And the &s;ame day the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> was Wounded in the Thigh with a Mu&s;quet|&s;hot; and &s;ome time before, Major General <HI>A&s;premont,</HI> with the fall of an Old Wall, and &s;everal others of le&s;&s;er Note.</P>
<P>On the Thirty Fir&s;t, The Canon continued to Play on both Sides very furiou&s;ly, with very good Effect on the part of the Be&s;iegers; nor were the Be&s;ieged Idle, but proceeded with great Endeavours, and indefatigable Indu&s;try, with Earth, Faggots, and other Materials to make up the Breaches, and to Intrench them&s;elves within them; however, the Be|&s;iegers &s;o far Advanced, that they, in a manner, formed their Gallery, and appeared every where de&s;irous to give the A&s;&s;ault, though about this time (without any ju&s;t Ground) the Camp was Alarumed by the Country People, through a Report &s;pread abroad, that there were Powerful Armies of <HI>Turks</HI> approaching; but whil&s;t every Body was wondring from whence they &s;hould come, all that could be gathered was, that <HI>Teckley,</HI> who with &s;mall Parties was wandring about the Neighbourhood of <HI>Semendria,</HI> had bribed &s;ome, and deceived others into this Opinion; whereupon a Body of Hor&s;e was &s;ent out in &s;earch of him; and the Scouts that came in brought a certain account, that <HI>O&s;man Teghen</HI> re|mained at <HI>Ni&s;&s;a</HI> with his Hor&s;e, mo&s;t of his Infantry having,
<PB N="18" REF="11">upon Di&s;contents, want of Pay, and for other Rea&s;ons, de|&s;erted him; however, he continued to de&s;troy all the For|rage, and Burn the Towns for above Forty Miles in circum|ference; yet, &s;o great was the Plenty in the Imperial Camp, that a Fat-Oxe might be bought for a Duccate; and even at <HI>Vienna</HI> it &s;elf Provi&s;ions could not be Purcha&s;ed at &s;o cheap a Rate; one main Rea&s;on for it being the Three Bridges, that gave free Forrage and Communication on all &s;ides, <HI>viz.</HI> One over the <HI>Save,</HI> Another over the <HI>Thy&s;&s;e,</HI> and a Third over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a little above <HI>Belgrade:</HI> And now, upon the News of the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>Peter Wa|radine,</HI> His Electoral Highne&s;s &s;ent thither to Complement him upon His coming into <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;ince the Recovery of His late Indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>On the Fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> the Canon from Six Batteries and Thirty Two Mortars, Played upon the Ca&s;tle, widen|ing the Breach, and doing con&s;iderable Execution; under the favour of which, the Be&s;iegers began to fill up the Ditch, preparing &s;everal Mines to be u&s;eful towards a ge|neral A&s;&s;ault: And Major General <HI>Dunwalt</HI> Marched out with Twelve Regiments of Hor&s;e towards <HI>Semendria,</HI> to &s;eize upon, and &s;ecure &s;uch part of the Country as remained Unharra&s;ed, or not De&s;troyed by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>On the Second, the Canon ruined the Be&s;ieged's Batteries, and the Defences they had made within the Breaches, by way of Reintrenchments, &s;o that the Breach was conceived wide enough to Enter; yet the Be&s;ieged continued Ob&s;ti|nate, refu&s;ing to return any An&s;wer to the Summons &s;ent them, on the Twenty Ninth of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and &s;eemed rather to expect the la&s;t Extremity, than think of terms of Agree|ment by way of Capitulation, and timely Surrender; whereupon it was concluded, that the Town and Ca&s;tle be|ing made Saultable, no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in carrying it on with the utmo&s;t Courage and Vigour; &s;o that the Third,
<PB N="19" REF="11">Fourth, and Fifth days being &s;pent in Battering the yet remaining Works, Springing &s;ome Mines, and filling the Ditch to facilitate the A&s;cent, and giving nece&s;&s;ary Orders as to what was intended in the Execution, without any great di&s;turbance from the Be&s;ieged, though &s;everal were Killed and Wounded.</P>
<P>On the Sixth, the day appointed for the General A&s;&s;ault, (incouraged by their Commanders) after &s;ome Di&s;pute, in which many were Killed and Wounded, the Soldiers mounted the Breach, where the Be&s;ieged, with great Re&s;o|lution, made an Ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, and defended it with &s;o much Vigour, (Fighting like Men in De&s;pair, for the la&s;t Refuge and defence of their Lives) that the Be&s;iegers were twice beaten off: But the Elector him&s;elf, not &s;paring his Per&s;on in places of Eminent danger, being at hand, and animating the Officers and Soldiers upon the Third A&s;&s;ault, the Be&s;ieged finding all their Effort and Oppo&s;ition vain, began to lo&s;e Courage, and, by degrees, to Retire; &s;o that perceiving the Breach, and all their Retrenchments, on that part, intirely won, they abandoned the Fight, and fled to the Ca&s;tle, as the place of their la&s;t Retreat; but the Be|&s;iegers now entring like a Torrent, pre&s;&s;ing on with great Fury, entered pell-mell with them, putting all (in the fir&s;t heat, without di&s;tinction of Age and Sex) to the Sword, nor could the Riches they offered prevail to the &s;aving their Lives; which the Ba&s;&s;a perceiving, and find|ing no hopes of making any long Re&s;i&s;tance, he cau&s;ed Three Hundred Chri&s;tian Slaves to be brought, Chained together, which he placed before the retiring <HI>Turks,</HI> in &s;uch manner as they mu&s;t have received the Shot made at the Enemy; in compa&s;&s;ion to whom, the Soldiers &s;topped in the heat of Blood, and the Elector Commanded that Quar|ter &s;hould be given; whereupon, about Five Hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> that (under the favour of this Stratagem) had &s;aved
<PB N="20" REF="12">them&s;elves, together with the Ba&s;&s;a Governor, and Two other Ba&s;&s;a's, &s;ubmitted, and were made Pri&s;oners of War, with many that were not in Arms; when as the Ba&s;&s;a Go|vernor being brought to the Pre&s;ence of the Elector of <HI>Ba|varia,</HI> he fell pro&s;trate before him, and made it his earne&s;t Reque&s;t, that he might not be made a Pri&s;oner; (the <HI>Hun|garians,</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;cians,</HI> returning him extraordinary Thanks for &s;aving their Lives); to which humble Reque&s;t, His Electoral Highne&s;s, replyed, <HI>That he &s;hould experience, the Chri&s;tians u&s;e their Pri&s;oners better than the Turks do;</HI> adding withal, That he &s;hould be immediately &s;ent to the Emperor, at which he &s;eemed extreamly plea&s;ed; and thereupon General <HI>Car|raffa,</HI> who had it in charge to carry the Propo&s;als made by the <HI>Turks,</HI> was Commanded to take charge of him, and Guard him to <HI>New&s;tadt.</HI></P>
<P>The greate&s;t Prizes that were gained in the Sack of this Important Place, fell to the &s;hare of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slaves, who knew where their Ma&s;ters had hid their Trea&s;ure, during the Siege; of which, there were found about Six Hundred, the greater part of them <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> who had at &s;umdry times been taken by <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Parties, and brought or Sold to the <HI>Turks,</HI> Inhabitants of the City, and now found their deli|very from a long and cruel Bondage, by the prevailing Arms of their fellow Chri&s;tians: here were found likewi&s;e Seventy Pieces of Canon, great and &s;mall; and although the Town and Ca&s;tle was extreamly defaced by Fire, yet the Hou&s;es be|ing many of them ruinous before, and the greater part built with Timber, will, upon their Rebuilding, render them more Famous; which will not long be wanting, by rea&s;on of its Commodious Scituation for Trade, and confluence of People that are &s;oon expected thither from their Neigh|bouring Parts.</P>
<P>This Action la&s;ted Four hours, with much Blood-&s;hed and Slaughter on both Sides, mo&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on
<PB N="21" REF="12">Soldiers being Killed, a Thou&s;and dead Bodies being after|ward found, and thrown into the River, and Three Thou&s;and made Pri&s;oners; nor was the number of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;lain in the A&s;&s;ault, incon&s;iderable, among whom, of more par|ticular Note (in relation to their Characters and Quality) fell Lieutenant General Count <HI>D' Schariffenburg;</HI> the Count <HI>Emanuel d' Fru&s;temburg,</HI> Colonel of Foot; and the Young Count <HI>d'Staremberg;</HI> &s;o unto the Governor of <HI>Vienna,</HI> many likewi&s;e of Note were Wounded, among&s;t whom, the E|lector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> him&s;elf &s;lightly in the Cheek, as he expo&s;ed his Per&s;on in places of danger, to Incourage the A&s;&s;ailants, and give nece&s;&s;ary Orders.</P>
<P>And thus in the &s;pace of Twenty Two days the Famous City of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> fell into the Hands of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and by its Reduction, opened them a way into all the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions that are con&s;iderable in <HI>Europe;</HI> there being no Place of great Importance between it and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Metropolis of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which (if the In|te&s;tine Commotions of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes hinder not) may undoubtedly, in a &s;hort time, follow the Fortune of this &s;trong City; as al&s;o their other places got, and unju&s;tly detained from the <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tians, to the &s;haking, if not the Overthrow of that Bloody Empire, which (for upward of Two Hundred Years) has been &s;o terrible to Chri&s;tendom.</P>

We are further a&s;&s;ured, that of the</HI> 1000 <HI>Boats that fled from</HI> Belgrade, <HI>before and after it was Inve&s;ted, not above</HI> 200 <HI>of them Arrived in places of Safety, the re&s;t being either Stranded, bedded in the Mudd for want of Water, or De&s;erted by &s;uch as were in them, out of a fear they were Pur&s;ued, and by that means mo&s;t of the De&s;erters with their Baggage fell into the hands of the Country people, or &s;uch parties as were abroad to &s;cowre the Coa&s;t, and ga|ther the Spoil,</HI></P>
