<HEAD>A BRIEFE RELATION Of the late Horrid <HI>REBELLION,</HI> Acted in the I&s;land <HI>BARBADAS</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_ALthough this I&s;land is now be|come famous, by rea&s;on of the Rich Commodities there pro|duced; Yet in regard it is but of late yeeres that it hath been had in &s;uch high e&s;timation, we &s;hall give you a briefe relation of its former e&s;tate and condition, and how it hath attained to that height it is now in.</P>
<P>Not many yeares &s;ince, this I&s;land was in a very low condition, in regard the Commodities (then there produced) were onely Tobaccoes
<PB N="2" REF="4"> and Cotton-wools, which (by rea&s;on of the great quantities tran&s;ported from thence, and other places) was of very &s;mall value: In&s;omuch that Merchants begun to neglect the &s;upplying of it in &s;o large a manner as formerly they had done, which pre&s;ented it in a declining condition, and &s;mall hopes appeared of rai&s;ing any fortunes there for the future, the Inhabitants (being &s;o wearied out with the &s;mall profits they reaped of their toyl&s;ome labours) daily run from the I&s;land in Boats, being very much indebted both to the Merchants, and al&s;o to one another.</P>
<P>The decaying condition of this I&s;land (&s;o plainly appearing) &s;ome of ingenious &s;pirits &s;et their wits at worke to con&s;ider which way the de&s;olation of this Plantation might be preven|ted; which could not po&s;&s;ibly be effected, with|out the producing of &s;ome richer commodities to invite the Merchant to &s;upply them.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering <HI>Sugar</HI> was not the lea&s;t of commodities, (finding the &s;cituation of the place promi&s;ing that way) re&s;olved to make tryall thereof, and accordingly did; and with divers yeeres paines, care, patience, and indu&s;try, with the disbur&s;ing of va&s;t &s;ummes of money, brought the &s;ame to perfection. The Originall whereof were &s;ome that now are forced from thence, and unju&s;tly compelled to leave their relations and e&s;tates; who communicating their knowledge
<PB N="3" REF="4"> therein to others, cau&s;ed a farther going upon this de&s;igne, in&s;omuch that in few yeares there was a con&s;iderable number of works erected, &s;o that (for the&s;e divers years la&s;t pa&s;t) there hath been, and is, a very faire Corre&s;pondency held with <HI>England,</HI> New <HI>England, Holland, Hambrough,</HI> and other places, many both Mer|chants (and others) having thereby rai&s;ed them|&s;elves very con&s;iderable Fortunes. There being many Millions of <HI>Sugars</HI> tran&s;ported from thence yearely, and the number of Ships that come yearely to that I&s;land, not le&s;&s;e then a hundred Sayle; the commodities (being not onely <HI>Sugar)</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Indico, Ginger,</HI> with <HI>Cotton|wools,</HI> and &s;ome &s;mall quantities of <HI>Tobacco.</HI></P>
<P>All the time of <HI>Englands</HI> troubles we retain|ed peace among&s;t us, (though not without heart-burnings from tho&s;e of the Kings party, towards tho&s;e that wi&s;hed the Parliaments pro|&s;perity) and although Commi&s;&s;ions came over, (&s;ome from the King, and others from the Par|liament) yet we con&s;idering that it could not any way conduce to their advantage, (for us to to have Parties and Sidings among&s;t us) con|clude rather to imbrace Neutrality, and accor|dingly doe, holding a very faire Corre&s;pon|dency each with other for &s;everall years toge|ther with great content.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the Warrs, (when
<PB N="4" REF="5"> the Sun of the Cavaliers expected Conque&s;t, be|gun to be retrograde, and God was plea&s;ed to &s;hew him&s;elfe, highly countenancing the Parli|aments Forces; and by his (ever to be ho|noured) In&s;truments began to vanqui&s;h the Ca|valre, divers of them came over to our I&s;land, pretending to have done great &s;ervice for his Maje&s;ty, and that therefore the Parliament had Seque&s;tred their E&s;tates, and them&s;elves forced to fly for Refuge.</P>
<P>The&s;e men were by the Governor (and o|thers of their owne Spirits, who had the Go|vernment in their hands) very courteou&s;ly Im|braced, and looked upon as the men onely truly de&s;erving, in &s;o much that in &s;hort time, they begin to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e E&s;tates, (though other mens) and by the &s;ubtile practicing of <HI>Ab&s;alons</HI> pol|licy, began to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the peo|ples favour, and to gaine the e&s;teeme and repute of the onely knowing men; In&s;omuch that not|with&s;tanding their little or no knowlodge of the Country, the People, (or the E&s;tate or con|dition of either) they mu&s;t and were made Coun&s;ellers, and no Seate could become them to Sit in, but at the helme of State; And now the &s;hip of that flouri&s;hing Common-wealth mu&s;t run what cour&s;e they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But this is not all, after their advance to this height of Eminency; they are upon new
<PB N="5" REF="5"> de&s;ignes, and (under pretence they had received Letters from <HI>England,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would vi&s;ite us) the Country mu&s;t be put in a po&s;ture of Warre, them&s;elves being Commanders in chiefe, creates &s;uch inferiour Officers under them (as re&s;embling a no&s;e of wax was &s;ubject to &s;tand any way they plea&s;ed to &s;et it) and fit to receive any Impre&s;&s;ion they &s;hould put upon it.</P>
<P>Having fitted them&s;elves for their intended progre&s;&s;e, they begin to Act in a very high na|ture, and with no le&s;&s;e &s;everity then cruelty be|gin to pro&s;ecute all &s;uch per&s;ons as any way &s;eemed to declare their approbations of the Parliaments proceedings again&s;t the King; cut|ting out of tongues, Stigmatizing and Bani&s;hing all &s;uch per&s;ons, as they had any thing again&s;t concerning him.</P>
<P>The&s;e things (how unju&s;t &s;oever deemed and apprehended by many) yet for quietne&s;&s;e &s;ake were pa&s;&s;ed by, and not publikely &s;poke again&s;t by any.</P>
<P>The&s;e new-modell'd Magi&s;ters being very active in their places, (and no le&s;&s;e &s;tudious how to pick a quarrell with the Parliaments friends in generall, then formerly they had beene ex|treame in Executing their plea&s;ures upon &s;ome in particular) &s;et their wits at work which way they &s;hould bring the&s;e their de&s;ignes to per|fection;
<PB N="6" REF="6"> And (not finding the lea&s;t &s;ymptome or appearance of any cau&s;e given them by tho&s;e they would &s;o gladly quarrell withall) were very much at a &s;tand; but at length re&s;olve upon the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and from among&s;t them|&s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> the Coun&s;ell and A&s;&s;embly, make choyce of a certaine number of &s;uch per&s;ons, (as were mo&s;t &s;ubject to conception, after a recep|tance of Sathans &s;eede) giving them power to &s;it in Coun&s;ell, and to pre&s;cribe a way to the re&s;t, how to accompli&s;h their &s;o earne&s;t de|&s;ires.</P>
<P>The&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners (as we mu&s;t call them, for they will not be called a Committee) having conceived, in&s;tead of a Manchild brought forth a Mon&s;ter called <HI>Pre&s;ent Bani&s;hment;</HI> conclu|ding that Forces &s;hould be rai&s;ed and kept a|foot, till all &s;uch as they plea&s;ed to nominate were &s;ent off the I&s;land.</P>
<P>But ere they begin to fall into extremity, (to be delivered) they &s;weare each other to &s;ecrecy, that what&s;oever was nominated or propounded in their time of private Con&s;ultation, &s;hould not be revealed to any what&s;oever.</P>
<P>After their deliverance (when conveniency of time pre&s;ented) this mon&s;ter was pre&s;ented to the Governour, Coun&s;ell and A&s;&s;embly, (fir&s;t &s;wearing them) that if what they had to pre&s;ent them withall &s;hould not be approved of and
<PB N="7" REF="6"> accepted, they &s;hould not reveale the &s;ame, nor any one particular that &s;hould occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;e among&s;t them, &s;wearing to pro&s;ecute that par|ty to death that &s;hould divulge their &s;ecrets in any of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>This is concluded on. And now it onely re|maines to be di&s;puted, whether the fruits of their conception, great travell, and tedious paynes, is fit to have admittance, or whether to be buried in the grave of oblivion, as an abortive, or rather an abominable birth.</P>
<P>A long di&s;cour&s;e is entertained upon this &s;ub|ject; And the Parents of this new birth, being much taken with it, and though it appeared, and was a Mon&s;ter in the e&s;teeme of others, yet being the fruits of their Travells it appeared a Child to them. And therefore no Arguments mu&s;t prevaile again&s;t its acceptance, yet at la&s;t (though with much difficulty) it was di&s;-owned totally, for this rea&s;on; That to bani&s;h men, and &s;how no cau&s;e, nor appearance of cau&s;e, neither any pretence of cau&s;e, would be a thing apprehended of all to be ridiculous, and might cau&s;e a too quick di&s;covery of their intentions.</P>
<P>Before we proceede any further in this our intended Di&s;cour&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to an|&s;wer an Objection which haply &s;ome may make thus.</P>
<P>Object.</P>
<P>How we came to know their private
<PB N="8" REF="7"> Conferences had together; they having &s;worne each other to &s;ecrecy, and further to pro&s;ecute that man to death that &s;hould reveale any one particular.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Our an&s;wer to this Objection is; That L^^t. C <HI>C. C.</HI> one of them&s;elves was the di&s;cover|er of the&s;e and many more their intents and purpo&s;es, who acknowledged him&s;elfe appre|hen&s;ive of an obligation binding his con&s;cience to reveale things of &s;o high a nature as this; &s;eeing there was no rea&s;on for the doing of any &s;uch thing. For this his offence he was cen&s;ured to pay twenty thou&s;and pounds in <HI>Sugar,</HI> fine, and to depart the I&s;land.</P>
<P>To proceede in our Di&s;cour&s;e, we mu&s;t take notice that at this in&s;tant of time, when this thing called <HI>[Bani&s;hment]</HI> was objected again&s;t, as not convenient at that time to be put in Exe|cution; A brother of that Fraternity, being fearfull his brethren might mi&s;carry, had drawn up an Act and Oath, which hee then pre&s;ented to the A&s;&s;embly, who after a &s;erious view taken thereof, finding enough in it to procure a di&s;|like of it, in all or mo&s;t men, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e that made con&s;cience of their wayes, con|firmes it.

<P>Before we proceede to the particulars of the Oath (before mentioned) let us a little take notice of the&s;e mens proceedings, how plainely and palpably they throw dirt in the faces of tho&s;e that differ in judgement from them&s;elves. And how odious they endeavor to make them appeare unto the people, by fathering upon them all the de&s;olations, and di&s;&s;olutions of Kingdomes and E&s;tates; and that they profe&s;&s;e Religion for no other end nor purpo&s;e, then to make it the cloke of their mi&s;chievous acti|ons. And under the pretence of granting liber|ty, would bring us under the greate&s;t of bon|dages, for by this their Act, if any man be found comming or going to or from (any thing they plea&s;e to call a Conventicle) &s;hall for the fir&s;t offence be committed to pri&s;on, there to remaine for the &s;pace of three moneths without bayle or maineprize; and not onely &s;o but mu&s;t be fined and ran&s;omed at the plea&s;ure of the A&s;&s;embly; And for his &s;econd offence &s;hall be

Now, no doubt his life goes to it, for all be&s;ides is gone. Hereby you may plaine|ly &s;ee the tempers of the&s;e mens Spirits, that under the pretence of liberty doe mo&s;t &s;ubtilly labour to in&s;nare us in the greate&s;t &s;lavery that ever was exerci&s;ed upon the Theater of the earth.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops (in their time) were content with part of all, but the&s;e men will have all; all Bodies, all E&s;tates, and nothing &s;ounds well with them but All, All; Oppre&s;&s;ion, Tyranny, Slavery and Cruelty; while&s;t they pretend free|dome and liberty: And if you plea&s;e to take notice, you &s;hall finde them by and by (as &s;oone as they perceive the my&s;tery of their iniquity di&s;covered) acting quite contrary to this their Act of grace (as they call it) and are fining and bani&s;hing all &s;uch as will not pin their faiths up|on their &s;leeves, and beleeve as they do.</P>

<P>This Act and Oath being (by the Governor, Councell, and A&s;&s;embly) confirmed, was Or|dered to be publi&s;hed in the &s;everall Pari&s;hes in the I&s;land, and after publication, the Oath to be admini&s;tred to the Inhabitants in generall.</P>
<P>But before the publi&s;hing thereof, one of the grand Agents therein pre&s;ented a copy of it to &s;ome friends of ours, and (Serpent like) u&s;ed all the faire pretences that might be to animate them to reli&s;h it, alledging the great convenien|cies
<PB N="18" REF="12"> contained in it for the uniting of the Inha|bitants, with divers other expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the parties to whom it was &s;howne, de|clared their utter di&s;like of it, That it tended to the perpetuating them and theirs in place of authority; and to the &s;etting up of a Government of will and power. That there was no rea&s;on why they &s;hould have &s;uch a tie upon the people, &s;eeing they had no ingagement from them to govern according to the known Lawes of the Land; That the I&s;land was in peace, and like &s;o to continue; and for any &s;uch ingagement there was no apparent nece&s;&s;ity. That the People were, in generall, obedient to the pre&s;ent Go|vernment, and what would they de&s;ire more?</P>
<P>The party that pre&s;ented the afore&s;aid copy, &s;eemed not a litle troubled, that this Oath, and Act was no better reli&s;hed; affirming there was nothing in it but what tended to the uniting of the People, and the continuation of peace a|mong&s;t them.</P>
<P>The&s;e our friends having had a &s;ight and view of this Act and Oath, gave others to under|&s;tand the contents thereof, finding it to in|trench too much upon the Peoples ju&s;t rights and priviledges, bethought them&s;elves which way it might be po&s;&s;ible to prevent the publi&s;h|ing thereof, which they apprehended mu&s;t be by repairing to the Governour, which they did,
<PB N="19" REF="12"> de&s;iring him to take into his con&s;ideration the large extent thereof; That it was contrary to the Law of God, Nature and Nations, for them to impo&s;e any &s;uch Oath upon a free People as they were; That of nece&s;&s;ity they had &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter ends in it, it being &s;uch a thing as no preterit time could &s;hew any pre&s;ident for.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Governor expre&s;t him&s;elfe to this purpo&s;e, That he had &s;uffered this Act and Oath to pa&s;&s;e, onely for quietne&s;&s;e &s;ake, having to do with men of violent &s;pirits: his oppo&s;ing them might cau&s;e farther troubles, and his de|&s;ire was for the pre&s;ervation of that precious jewell, Peace, which we had &s;o long happily in|joyed: that although he had &s;uffered them to pa&s;&s;e, yet he apprehended inconveniencies in them; That if they plea&s;ed to leave him to him|&s;elfe, he would not be backward in applying him|&s;elfe to the con&s;idering of what was be&s;t to be done.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen had not been long gone from the Governour, but Colonell <HI>Humfrey Wallrond</HI> came, to whom the Governour after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es had together, declares hee had that day received a Letter from a Magi&s;trate, wherein he gave him to under&s;tand, that the Clarkes (in drawing of &s;everall Copies of the Act and Oath) had mi&s;taken them&s;elves, and
<PB N="20" REF="13"> writ non&s;ence; And for that rea&s;on it was con|cluded, with <HI>Waldronds</HI> advice, ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary they &s;hould be cal'd in, and the errors of the Clarks rectified.</P>
<P>This opportunity was imbraced by the Go|vernour, and his Letters &s;ent to the Prie&s;ts of every Pari&s;h to omit the publi&s;hing thereof, which was in like manner done.</P>
<P>This &s;top being made in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es for the pre&s;ent, did well; but the life of our liberties being now in much danger, &s;peciall care was taken how to prevent the publi&s;hing of the&s;e totally.

Upon notice given of their per&s;everance herein, the Governour &s;ent forth particular commi&s;&s;ions to Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Drax,</HI> and others, to rai&s;e forces for the pre&s;ervation of our peace, which hee found much threatned by &s;ome turbulent &s;pirits, which were very active in labouring to imbroyle the Inhabitants in an unnaturall War. By this time the&s;e men have rai&s;ed an Alarum, and are advancing towards the Bridge; here|upon the Governour &s;ends away a &s;econd Com|mi&s;&s;ion to Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Drax,</HI> to this purpo&s;e, that he &s;hould apprehend the bodies of the <HI>Waldronds</HI> (and their abettors) as fo|menters of Rebellion; upon the &s;ending of this Commi&s;&s;ion the Governour &s;ends Commi&s;&s;ary Generall <HI>John Parrat,</HI> to require <HI>Waldronds</HI> ap|pearance before him. And in ca&s;e of re|fu&s;all to command his Commi&s;&s;ion from him, the which if he &s;hould deny to deliver, then to proclaime him Rebell. Upon the receipt of the Governours Letter, <HI>Waldrond</HI> goes along with the Me&s;&s;enger, with whom we will leave him, and come to &s;peake of the Governour, who having received an invitation to dine at the Bridge that day, (with &s;ome Neighbours ac|companing him) rid thitherward; who, upon the way, was met by Colonell <HI>Edmond Reade,</HI> who then commanded a Troope of Hor&s;e, and

About three or foure houres after <HI>Wal|drond</HI> came to the Governour, and pre&s;ents him&s;elfe more like a Saint then a Rebell, and pleads Not guilty of any intention of evil in the lea&s;t.

<P>We have here a particular of the <HI>Propo&s;iti|ons,</HI> and what they containe (which is diver&s;e particulars) as to have the <HI>Independents,</HI> as they call them, di&s;armed: the Magazine delivered up to them, the King in&s;tantly &s;olemnly pro|claimed. Twenty &s;uch as they &s;hall nominate delivered into their cu&s;tody, to be brought,
<PB N="44" REF="26"> &s;ay they, to a legall tryall: al&s;o an Act of In|demnity for all that have ingaged with them. In briefe, they will have all power in their own hands, that they may act all what they plea&s;e, the Governour mu&s;t &s;tand for a cipher if he will not &s;ub&s;cribe to their plea&s;ures. If hee will &s;ubmit hee may repaire to them, but if hee will not, they have an Army on foot to force the accompli&s;hing of their ends. The Gover|nour loving peace, and looking upon the&s;e their &s;o &s;uddaine unwarrantable Actions, as proceeding from heate of bloud occa&s;ioned by &s;ome fal&s;e informations, &s;ub&s;cribes their <HI>Pro|po&s;itions&punc;</HI> not que&s;tioning but upon due delibera|tion taken, and both parties being heard &s;peak, things would be moderated, and tho&s;e preten|ded differences happily compo&s;ed. But alas, the Serpent is as &s;ubtill as the Dove is harme|le&s;&s;e; for after (with their pretences) they had prevailed with the Governour to come to them, they will have all things as they plea&s;e; and he mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue forth his Warrants for the ac|compli&s;hing of their &s;elfe-ends.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;turbers of our peace, mu&s;t and will have an Act of indemnity; for (&s;ay they to the Governour) the lawfull Armes we have taken for the defence of your &s;elfe and the publick; if they had &s;aid (for the offence of your &s;elfe and the publick) they had both &s;poke truth
<PB N="45" REF="26"> and &s;en&s;e, but now they &s;peake neither; if they had beene taken up for the defence of the Go|vernour and Countrey, then lawfully taken up; and if lawfully taken up, what needs an Act of oblivion and Indemnity? but they were taken up contrary to the Governours expre&s;&s;e command in his Declaration put forth upon paine of death, to force both him and the Countrey to &s;ubmit to their illegall, and mo&s;t horrid proceedings, to the Countries exceed|ing lo&s;&s;e, hinderance and prejudice.</P>
<P>This done, they nominate the twenty men, mentioned in their <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> who&s;e Names we &s;hall give you by and by, who were, divers of them, required by a Colonell of their party, to repaire with him to their Armies head quar|ters, who after &s;ome time being there, were permitted upon their Paroll, to returne to their Habitations, where wee will leave them till the next &s;ummons, and give you the re|lation of a further policy which they acted with as much fallacy as &s;ubtilty, thus. <HI>Waldrond</HI> bethinking him&s;elfe that while&s;t hee was active in ray&s;ing forces, hee had given out that the <HI>Independents</HI> were in Armes, intending to cut them off, and well knowing there were none in Armes (be&s;ides them&s;elves) but onely tho&s;e that were ray&s;ed by Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Drax,</HI> by the Governours e&s;peciall Order,
<PB N="46" REF="27"> and particular Commi&s;&s;ion to that purpo&s;e; They being but twenty Hor&s;e, and betwixt eighty and a hundred Foote, who had not acted any thing at all, &s;aving onely the appre|hending of one of <HI>Waldronds</HI> &s;onnes, who was with an Officer po&s;ting about to ray&s;e Forces for the Armies a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Forthwith advi&s;es a Colonell of their owne party (who&s;e Name we &s;hall omit to in&s;ert) to &s;end Order to his Lieutenant Colonell and Major for the ray|&s;ing of his Regiment, and their advance to a place by him appointed. This Colonell (to the end they might bring about their de&s;igne with applau&s;e) repaires to the Governour, and pre&s;ents his Regiment at his &s;ervice as a guard to attend him, who knowing nothing of their de&s;igne, gives way to the ray&s;ing of the Regi|ment, and command is forthwith &s;ent to the parties afore&s;aid; and by way of private Ala|rum, the Souldiers are in Armes, and appeare in their u&s;uall place of exerci&s;e, and from thence are commanded to march, which they doe, and as a further expedient for the accom|pli&s;hing of the de&s;igne intended, it is given forth by the Officers of the Regiment, That <HI>Waldrond</HI> had ray&s;ed Forces, and &s;urprized the Governour, and that their march was for his reliefe. That night they pitcht their colours in the Field, expecting in the Morning to
<PB N="47" REF="27"> march for the Governours reliefe (as was at fir&s;t pretended they &s;hould) but alas they are mi&s;taken, in&s;tead of marching they mu&s;t coun|ter-march home every man to his habitation upon paine of death; <HI>Waldrond</HI> hath effected his de&s;igne, and now his pretence is that this Regiment was ray&s;ed in oppo&s;ition to him, and therefore are held and deemed Delin|quents and Di&s;turbers of the peace, and mu&s;t be proceeded again&s;t accordingly; And Forces of Foote and Hor&s;e imployed to di&s;arme them forthwith, which was done, and they left to the cruelty of their &s;laves, who were of ability enough to de&s;troy, and murther them, had not God in mercy re&s;trayned their cruelty.</P>
<P>Having given you the particulars of this their Device and Invention, we &s;hall returne to &s;peake further of <HI>Waldrond</HI> and his crue, who now require the Governour to performe his ingagement with reference to his &s;ub&s;cribing the <HI>Propo&s;itions;</HI> which begins to be done, and in order thereunto the twenty &s;poke of for|merly in their <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> is &s;ent for by a Troope of hor&s;e, who&s;e Names we &s;hall give you ere we proceede any further, which is as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P> <HI>The further we proceede in our di&s;covery of the&s;e mens Actions, the more fallacies we &s;hall meete withall.

<P>You here &s;ee the great care they take for an exact proceeding and clo&s;e carrying on of their de&s;igne, and having begot a beliefe in the peo|ple of their owne Faction, that the afore&s;aid plot (fathered upon the <HI>Independents)</HI> was a mo&s;t horrid plot, and would undoubtedly have beene brought about, had not their wi&s;domes di&s;covered and prevented it; with this Siren &s;ong they have lull'd the poore People fa&s;t a&s;leepe, and &s;o leave them, and proceed to the further putting off their de&s;ignes in execution, to which purpo&s;e (as here you &s;ee) they have drawne up a very large Commi&s;&s;ion for the Le|vying of Fines upon mens E&s;tates, higher or lower, at their plea&s;ure, and to make Sale there|of, if the Fines they impo&s;e be not &s;atisfied ac|cording
<PB N="63" REF="35"> to their Order and Commands. But not a word now of a Legall tryall, &s;uch pro|ceedings are out of date with them, and now Will and Power is all in fa&s;hion: In their fir&s;t Act they are plea&s;ed to give us leave to enjoy (or rather looke upon our E&s;tates whil&s;t they enjoy them) for the &s;pace of three months next en&s;uing; But here is new news a comming by and by, you mu&s;t not expect any (acting by &s;uch principles as they doe) but be reall in any thing but fallacies, plentifully indued, with which we will leave them, and a litle take notice of the people, who generally begin to be weary with &s;leeping, and now grow &s;ick of an expectation, wondering there is no further di&s;covery made of this <HI>Independents</HI> plot &s;o long di&s;cour&s;t of, and hearing of the great Fines and Bani&s;h|ment impo&s;ed upon them without any Legall tryall in the face of the Country as was expect|ed, they begin to whi&s;per &s;omewhat loud, and to expo&s;tulate the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e thus; That if the&s;e <HI>Independents</HI> (as they call them) were guil|ty of &s;o horrid a plot as they had given out they were, why were they not pro&s;ecuted in law, and puni&s;hed according to the nature of their &s;o heinous offence? But if they had not of|fended in that nature, why were they &s;o highly Fined, (and Bani&s;hed) not knowing for what? Further alledging that the&s;e men &s;o fined and
<PB N="64" REF="36"> Bani&s;hed, had (the mo&s;t of them) lived a long time in the I&s;land, many of them having beene men of Eminency in place of Authority, and had ever laboured and endevoured to &s;et de&s;ignes a foote for the good and benefit of the I&s;land; That they were (generally) men of good E&s;tates in the I&s;land, and having &s;o long beene Studiers of peace, it did not &s;ound well that they &s;hould now be di&s;turbers of the &s;ame, further con&s;idering that <HI>Waldrond</HI> and his adhe|rents were men but newly advanced to place of Authority, and be&s;ides men of no fortunes there, onely had thru&s;t them&s;elves into Plantations; which as yet more properly appertained to o|thers then them&s;elves; That they had deluded them by pretending the <HI>Independents</HI> were in Armes, intending their &s;urpri&s;all and Ruine. That being advanced very neere them they found it not &s;o, but to the contrary none were in Armes but by the Governours order, and who had upon his Command disbanded and the like, upon the&s;e and the like con&s;iderations; The Soldiery Petitioned to be disbanded, &s;eeing none was found in any &s;uch po&s;ture as was pre|tended to them. <HI>Waldrond</HI> and his abettors, finding the people begin to grow &s;en&s;ible, and by their di&s;cour&s;e had together to &s;ift out the truth of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: They mu&s;t take coun&s;ell together, what is be&s;t to be done to prevent the
<PB N="65" REF="36"> peoples any further being privie to the my&s;tery of their iniquity; and finding no way of conve|niency but one, they conclude to ha&s;ten the de|parture of tho&s;e they purpo&s;ed to Bani&s;h, which they proceede in, and performe, under the pre|tence that keeping of forces a foote was very chargeable to the Country. Now what neede there was for keeping of forces a foote, (&s;eeing they had di&s;armed all they plea&s;ed) we &s;hall leave to the judicious to con&s;ider of; and pro|ceede to the Act for pre&s;ent bani&s;hment, it be|ing as followeth.</P>

<P>This Act being (by their Order) publi&s;hed, is &s;o farre from giving the People &s;atisfaction, that it rather begets further jelou&s;ies; for they looke upon this Act as the conclu&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and that now it is in vaine for them to expect any further or other proceedings, but that all is meerely done under a pretence to bring de&s;ignes about for the accompli&s;hing of their owne private ends. This doth not a little trouble the&s;e new modell'd States men, to &s;ee that the People begin more and more to di&s;cover them; And therefore they conclude (once more) to make a &s;how of doing &s;ome|thing to the purpo&s;e, and therefore a Com|mi&s;&s;ion is forthwith drawne up for certaine particular men therein nominated; for the &s;itting and &s;ummoning in of &s;uch of the Coun|trey, as they &s;hall thinke fit, to &s;ee if po&s;&s;ibly

Per&s;wading them that the <HI>Independents</HI> were the originalls of it; and fur|ther, that they admired they would &s;eeme to have any hand in &s;ub&s;cribing a Petition with them, &s;eeing they were Hereticks; <HI>And had murthered their Gracious dread Soveraigne Lord King</HI> CHARLES, and had bani&s;hed his Sons, the now CHARLES the &s;econd, and his Brother the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and mo&s;t mi|&s;erably ruined the mo&s;t Glorious Kingdom (one of them) in the World.</P>

<P>This poore &s;oule goes away very thankfull, apprehending their clemency hath extended wonderfully towards him, and having e&s;caped once, re&s;olves that <HI>Balaams</HI> A&s;&s;e &s;hall remaine alone upon Record for complaining of his Ma|&s;ters cruelty towards him; as for his part he will be an A&s;&s;embly mans A&s;&s;e to ride upon while he lives, ere he will be &s;o frighted againe. Thus they fright poore &s;imple Creatures into any thing they will have them to be or &s;ay. Now we mu&s;t take notice that while&s;t the&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ioners are &s;itting, and examining &s;uch as they &s;ee convenient for their purpo&s;es; There is another Generation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Commi&s;&s;i|oners for Compo&s;itions of Delinquents e|&s;tates, (as their brethren title them in their Commi&s;&s;ion) they fit under the &s;ame roofe, and their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is to &s;ummon all tho&s;e that are nominated to be bani&s;hed.

Well, now the Countrey is po&s;&s;e&s;t with a new faith, and have a &s;trong beliefe, that now at la&s;t this plot will be di&s;covered, and their long expectations &s;hall now be accompli&s;hed; But alas poore &s;oules! they are as farre from the marke as ever they were, and are mecrely drawne into a fooles paradice, for there is a plot found out, but not that they expected. The Commi&s;&s;ioners for Compo&s;itions doe (in|&s;teed of bringing men to a legall Tryall) take a Li&s;t of mens Lands, and under them to bring in their fines according to their fir&s;t Act made and publi&s;hed to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In plaine Engli&s;h, giving them to under&s;tand, that if they were not very quick in bringing in their Fines, they would take it by way of &s;traint, or otherwayes make &s;ale of their E&s;tates ac|cording to the tenor of their Commi&s;&s;ion; this and onely this is their whole and onely bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: and as for their brethren (the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Examination) they proceede as hath beene &s;aid, calling the Inhabitants of one Pari&s;h (this weeke) and the Inhabitants of
<PB N="80" REF="44"> the next Pari&s;h the next weeke, and &s;o divers weekes are &s;pent in deferring of time till the Fines were gathered in, and the time expired that the bani&s;hed had to &s;tay, and if they could but blindefold the People till then, all would be well. All this time their Troops of Hor&s;e are riding about the Countrey, and tho&s;e Cavees we formerly &s;poke of, are now mounted in|deed, upon the choice&s;t Hor&s;es in the Countrey, and if they are not well mounted to day, to morrow they will be, for all the Hor&s;es the <HI>Independents</HI> have, are, (nay mu&s;t, &s;hall be at their &s;ervice) and no oppo&s;ition mu&s;t be made again&s;t them, for they have an Act of oblivion, and Indemnity already pa&s;t for what they had, or &s;hould doe while&s;t they were in Armes.</P>
<P>The&s;e are now the Lords of the Land, and command what they plea&s;e, quartering one while at one Plantation, and another while at another, de&s;troying and con&s;uming the choyce&s;t Provi&s;ions the Countrey doth afford: and all too little to give them content, but mu&s;t and doe receive from them all the incivill and abu|&s;ive language they can devi&s;e; And this is all done to per&s;wade the People that the plot begins to be di&s;covered, and was dangerous, that not|with&s;tanding we were all long before di&s;armed, yet they dur&s;t not di&s;charge their forces of Hor&s;e, for feare of &s;ome treachery: with the&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="44"> pretences, they have anew be&s;otted and blin|ded the People, hoping &s;o to keepe them till we were gone, and then the worke would be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>But while&s;t they feede them&s;elves with the&s;e hopes, the people begin to awake from their long dreame of expectation, and con&s;ider with them&s;elves what the event of all this would be at la&s;t; They likewi&s;e take into &s;erious con|&s;ideration the&s;e Peoples gro&s;&s;e abu&s;es they put upon us, and how contrary to all rea&s;on they kept their Forces of Hor&s;e &s;till up, to the great prejudice of the Countrey, and that a great uprore had beene rai&s;ed in the Countrey to the Inhabitants great di&s;quiet, and all under pre|tence of that which in all this time they had not in the lea&s;t made appeare. That it appeared to them that they had a de&s;igne to &s;et up them|&s;elves and their adherents, and to make that I&s;land a receptacle for men of their owne &s;pirits: intending the ruine of all tho&s;e that &s;hould oppo&s;e them; &s;o that now it did con|cerne all men to looke about them, and if po&s;|&s;ible (to the utmo&s;t of their powers) labour the prevention of what was like to fall upon them in generall. The&s;e con&s;iderations cau&s;e many People (though Cavaliers) to murmur at their proceedings: in&s;omuch that &s;ome of them were que&s;tioned, and lookt upon as ad|herents
<PB N="82" REF="45"> to and favourers of the <HI>Independents</HI> (as they call them.) This fire being kindled would not be &s;o &s;peedily quenched, but they re&s;olve (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) to make the grandees ac|quainted with their thoughts concerning their proceedings, and to that purpo&s;e be|ing at a Fea&s;t (which at pre&s;ent is the greate&s;t of their imployments.) The twelfth day of <HI>Iune,</HI> 1650. the Captaines of their Army being likewi&s;e invited with them, made repaire into the roome where they were, and expre&s;t them&s;elves unto them to this purpo&s;e; That they heard there were great di&s;contents in the Countrey occa&s;ioned by their &s;o har&s;h dealing with the <HI>Independents,</HI> fearing that thereby Trade might be ob&s;tructed, which would be the certaine ruine of the Coun|trey; and that by their bidding defiance to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> (in &s;o high a nature) they &s;hould be proclaimed Rebells to their native Countrey, and deprived of all their faire &amp; free core&s;pon|dency, which they had &s;o long enjoyed; That when they commanded them in Armes they pretended it was onely to &s;how their loyalty, and forwardne&s;&s;e to and for His Maje&s;ty; And further that a plot was pretended to them that the <HI>Independents</HI> had to de&s;troy all the loyally affected to His Maje&s;ty, which as yet had not appeared according to expectation, with divers

<P>The&s;e di&s;contents of the People they &s;eeme to remove, with incouraging them, that they needed not &s;uffer their thoughts to be po&s;&s;e&s;t with any &s;uch thing, as that the <HI>Parliament</HI> would take notice of their proceedings again&s;t them, alledging, they had their hands full otherwayes, that if it were not &s;o, they might fix their eye upon <HI>Virginia, Bermoudas,</HI> and the like, who had &s;hown them a pre&s;ident for what they did; and yet the <HI>Parliament</HI> had not once taken notice of it; That they would find wayes of protection, <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;o that they neither did, nor would, neither had cau&s;e, to mind the <HI>Parliament,</HI> nor what they would, or could doe to them, with divers &s;leighting expre&s;&s;ions, and contumelious words to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions (however &s;moothed up, and &s;eemingly taken no notice of to the eye of the People) yet notwith&s;tanding is Gall and Vineger, bitter unto them; now they apprehend the my&s;tery of their iniquity begins to be di&s;|covered through the thin vaile of their preten|ces,

<P>The&s;e men want not of re&s;olution to carry on their de&s;igne, they Bani&s;h us from all thats deare unto us, (that they can Bani&s;h us from) and yet they will have us acknowledge they have dealt very favourably with us; They charge us with Impudence, but it is <HI>Shimeis</HI> di&s;po&s;ition to raile, and therefore we will pa&s;&s;e it by as an
<PB N="88" REF="48"> Imperfection in him, and onely take notice that their proceedings are carried on with confi|dence in the be&s;t nature; charging us with mo&s;t palpable untruths, in all their Declarations, and who &s;o will but take notice of them, &s;hall find them fathering all manner of forgeries upon us. They charge us with going from place to place to &s;tir up the people to &s;ide with us, accu&s;ing us of reporting they were a&s;hamed of what they had done, which thing is mo&s;t fal&s;e. But this we conclude, that if the &s;pirit of grace were &s;o pre|valent with them, as the &s;pirit of deceit and fal&s;hood is, they would and ju&s;tly might be a|&s;hamed of that way they have &s;o unju&s;tly and perniciou&s;ly proceeded in; But it fares with them as with the Bankrout, when &s;eeing he is over-&s;hoos, &s;teps further into the deepe of a de|&s;perate condition, and concludes it cannot be wor&s;e then it is; The&s;e men have decreed a wicked decree to ruine men, their Wives and Children to perpetuity, to advance them&s;elves and theirs, and the <HI>Serpent</HI> that per&s;waded them to begin it (as yet) failes them not, but pre&s;&s;es them on to effect the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e they have begun; And to that purpo&s;e fits them with new &s;upplies of fal&s;e and &s;candalous &s;ugge&s;tions, fathering the di&s;covery of all their mi&s;chievous actions upon us, when all that are not wilfully blind may run and reade them. It is worthy the taking no|tice
<PB N="89" REF="48"> of, how this potion (given them by their owne party) works, It inflames the blood, of|fends the &s;tomach, di&s;turbs the braine in &s;o high a nature, that they are no better then meerely mad; And &s;eeing their de&s;ignes di&s;covered (ere it was totally effected) they are now re|&s;olved that as the Father of lies hath &s;hewed them the way, they will with all diligence pro|ceede and fini&s;h a bloudy Tragedy, (if God by his providence doe not gratiou&s;ly prevent it;) And being brought to their la&s;t &s;hift, they will not looke upon any thing as an ob&s;tacle in their way, but lives as well as E&s;tates &s;hall goe to &s;a|tisfie their lu&s;ts. It was the expre&s;&s;e words of Colonel <HI>T.

<P>Thus (courteous Reader) as briefely as with conveniency we could, you have the true and perfect relation of all their proceedings, of which if thou do&s;t but take a &s;erious view, (with the eye of impartiality) thou wilt find them (whil&s;t charging us with a plot again&s;t them) mo&s;t plainly plotting, complotting, and con|&s;piring fir&s;t again&s;t us for our E&s;tates, and now at la&s;t for our lives; we &s;hall now proceede to a Declaration, wherein we &s;hall not a&s;&s;ert any thing but truth it &s;elfe, which we declare and affirme to God and the world, (being well a&s;|&s;ured that we mu&s;t give an account thereof, as well as of all other our words and actions at the la&s;t and dreadfull day of the Lord;) By which their &s;hame and our innocency will mo&s;t plaine|ly apppeare.</P>

<PB N="93" REF="50"> information of Impartiall &s;pirits, we have put forth this Declaration, which with their &s;everall proceedings again&s;t us, we de&s;ire them to peru&s;e and impartially to judge of; And if we in any particular appeare guilty of their Charge laid again&s;t us, then let the righteous &s;mite us, and it &s;hall be a kind|ne&s;&s;e; let them reprove us, and it &s;hall be an excellent oyle which &s;hall not breake our head.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place (as a prime piece of their policy) they begin with matter of Religion; Calling us &s;editious, &s;chi&s;maticall, and facti|ous per&s;ons, hereby endeavouring to make us appeare odious to the people, and Here|ticks in their e&s;teeme, and appearing &s;o to them.

<PB N="94" REF="51"> <HI>are written in the Law and the Prophets,</HI> de&s;iring with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>to know no|thing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified;</HI> being &s;tedfa&s;tly a&s;&s;ured that <HI>there is no o|ther name under Heaven, whereby we &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> then by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; <HI>who is to us ju&s;tification, Sanctification, and Redemption;</HI> de&s;irous to be <HI>zealous of good works,</HI> becau&s;e the Lord hath com|manded us to be <HI>Holy, as he is Holy,</HI> and becau&s;e good works are profitable unto men, but not dreaming (as &s;ome doe) to merit our owne Salvation thereby; which <HI>glorious inheritance Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath already pur|cha&s;ed with his precious bloud;</HI> To which <HI>precious fountaine, who &s;o doth not come to wa&s;h, &s;hall remaine be&s;potted with the Lepro&s;ie of Sin, and guilt to all Eter|nity.</HI> But we intend not any large di&s;cour&s;e (at pre&s;ent) upon this particular, onely the&s;e few words that are &s;poken, are to the appre|hen&s;ions of tho&s;e we de&s;ire to give &s;atisfacti|on to, in this fir&s;t particular, which is to point of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The next thing they object again&s;t us is,
<PB N="95" REF="51"> our being &s;tirred up by many fal&s;e &s;candalls and &s;ugge&s;tions fomented and &s;pred abroad by the heads (&s;ay they) of the <HI>Independent</HI> Faction; In an&s;wer to which we po&s;itively declare, that we were not moved to doe what we did, (which was onely to Petition by any other per&s;on or per&s;ons, thing or things what&s;oever, &s;ave only the per&s;ons &amp; actions of them&s;elves declared in their <HI>Act</HI> &amp; <HI>Oath,</HI> which they would have impo&s;ed upon us, whereby at once they went about to deprive us of all our lawfull Rights and Priviledges, and to make us, and ours, &s;laves and va&s;&s;alls to them and theirs to perpetuity; Obliging us by Oath, to maintaine them and their acti|ons (with our lives and fortunes) again&s;t all power what&s;oever that &s;hould oppo&s;e them: So that though they &s;hould be guilty of all the unju&s;t actions that it is po&s;sible for men to be guilty of under the Sun (as they are &s;ub|ject enough to be) whether committed a|gain&s;t our &s;elves, or the authority e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>England,</HI> (or both) or any authority from them derived, whereby they might (or &s;hould) call them to an account for their un|ju&s;t

<P>This Charge containes matter of Fact in a ve|ry high nature indeed, &amp; were it not that Sathan can transforme him&s;elfe into an Angell of light, and when he intends the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefes,
<PB N="98" REF="53"> pretend the mo&s;t of goodne&s;&s;e, we &s;hould more then admire the fallacies of fraile man, (who&s;e breath is in his No&s;trils) who in the Morning flouri&s;heth and boa&s;teth great things, and in the Evening is cut downe and withered; who doth attempt to make God him&s;elfe, as it were a Fig-leafe, to cover the nakedne&s;&s;e of their mo&s;t dete&s;table and abhorred actions: But leaving this we come to an&s;wer the particulars of their Charge. And fir&s;t, as for Armes there were none taken up but by the Governours ex|pre&s;&s;e order, and particular Commi&s;&s;ions then immediately directed to Lieutenant Colonell <HI>James Drax</HI> and others. Secondly, the forces that were rai&s;ed, did not exceede the number of one hundred and forty both Hor&s;e and Foote; who acted no ho&s;tility at all, &s;ave onely that one of <HI>Waldrond</HI> his Sonnes rideing about (with an Officer of theirs) to rai&s;e forces for the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of their Army, was taken by one of the Scouts and brought to the hou&s;e of Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Drax,</HI> where he received all civill re|&s;pect, and was di&s;charged &s;oone after upon the Governours order; This is all that was done or offered to be done by any of the &s;aid Forces, (for which they had the Governours expre&s;&s;e order) upon who&s;e Command they disbanded, being not guilty of any other Act of ho&s;tility then what is here declared. You may take notice
<PB N="99" REF="53"> of a &s;mall party of Hor&s;e which the Governour had to waite upon him (after he had notice <HI>Waldrond</HI> was re&s;olved to rai&s;e Rebellion) the number of which did not exceede thirty. As for any other Forces there were none ray&s;ed, &s;ave onely one Regiment, and that was by expre&s;&s;e Order from the Colonell thereof, who is none of the lea&s;t of <HI>Waldronds</HI> Abettors; This Re|giment was commanded into the Field by the Lieutenant Colonell, Major, and &s;everall Cap|taines thereof, at night, and in the morning they were all di&s;charged, every man reparing to his owne Habitation, not having acted any ho&s;tility at all in the lea&s;t.</P>
