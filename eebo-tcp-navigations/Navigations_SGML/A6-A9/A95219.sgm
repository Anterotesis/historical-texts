<P>_AS I was di&s;patching the other Letter comming herewith, the &s;ame mor|ning our Scout a-head di&s;covered a Fleet, which in a &s;hort time ap|peared to be the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet come from the <HI>Wellings,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 97 &s;ail, or there|abouts, whereof 90 men of War; we made what &s;ail after them we could, which the enemy di&s;|cerning, &s;tood away from us, &s;o that it was five a clock in the evening before any of our Frigots could engage them, and neer &s;even a clock before this Ship came up with them, the greate&s;t part of our Fleet being a &s;tern, &s;o that not above thir|ty of our &s;hips and frigots came to engage; yet we continued fighting until 9 at night, at which time being dark, we were forced to forbear. The enemy this night got the weather gage of us, by &s;tanding to the Northward, when we &s;uppo&s;ed they had &s;tood to the Southward, as we did; and ye&s;terday being much wind, and durty wea|ther, nothing was done, both Fleets finding it hard work to get off from a Lee &s;hore, which
<PB N="2" REF="3">was the wor&s;t to us, being in an enemies Coun|try; but this morning, being fair weather, and little wind, both Fleets prepared for a &s;econd Engagement. To this time the Lord &s;eemed to encourage the enemy, by laying the &s;cales in the ballance, &s;o that neither could tell which had the better, but good was the Lord unto us, who knew when to appear for his own people, though unworthy of &s;o great a mercy; for this day after their great &s;hips from the <HI>Texel</HI> were joined with them, being twenty five in num|ber, the Engagement began very hot from &s;even in the morning, and continued till one in the af|ternoon, the enemy having the weather-gage of us all the while; yet may we truly &s;ay, great was the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be prai&s;ed, by his appearance on our behalf; for by this time the Lord &s;o daunted their &s;pirits, they now began to &s;tand away from us, with all the &s;ails they could, there being &s;unk, fired and taken of them, about thirty or fourty &s;ail, &s;o far as we can di&s;cern, and are now in pur&s;ute of them, &s;ome of our Frigots being neer up with &s;ome of the &s;ternmo&s;t, &amp; am in good hopes that the &s;ame mighty pre&s;ence of the Lord will &s;till follow us, to the di&s;abling, taking or di&s;troying of &s;ome more yet. There were nine flagge &s;hips among&s;t them, when we fir&s;t engaged this morning, and they have but one left now &s;o far as we can &s;ee. At pre&s;ent I am not in a capacity of giving your Lord&s;hips a more particular account, our hands and hearts being wholy taken up with the end of the work, and if the Lord will, you may expect
<PB N="3" REF="3">(about two dayes hence) to have a further ac|count thereof. Two of our &s;hips were fired, (as &s;uppo&s;ed, by the enemy) &s;ome others di&s;abled by the lo&s;s of their ma&s;ts, of which I have given the Commi&s;&s;ioners a further account, for a pre&s;ent and &s;peedy &s;upply, which I &s;hall not trouble you with; but &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<P>_SINCE mine to you ye&s;terday (wherein I gave you an Ac|count of the goodne&s;s of God towards us, and appearance for us in the Engagement with our enemies the day before, and that we were then in pur&s;ute of them) there hath little more been done, night drawing on, and the Dutch making directly for the Texell with what &s;ail they could, &s;o that it was not thought fit to be &s;o bold with the &s;hore as they might, not knowing how the wind might take us, many of our Ships being much di&s;abled; but gave order to a &s;mall ve&s;&s;ell or two to keep &s;ight of them till the mor|ning, and ob&s;erve what cour&s;e they &s;teer|ed, who returning gave an account that the enemy &s;teered the &s;ame night into the Texel harbour, and had boats with lights to &s;hew them the way in, whereupon ye|&s;terday
<PB N="5" REF="4">at a Councill of War it was re&s;ol|ved, that the whole Fleet &s;hould forthwith &s;et &s;ail for Southold Bay there to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch Ships as are di&s;abled, al&s;o to &s;end away our wounded men and pri&s;oners, of which a certain account cannot be given at pre&s;ent, but hope to do it very &s;uddenly being now upon it; but I do pre&s;ent your Lord&s;hips here enclo&s;ed with a gene|rall Account, referring the condition of the Wives and Families of tho&s;e who are &s;lain, to your Lord&s;hips tender care, wher|in I doubt not but you will have re&s;pect to their nece&s;&s;ities.
