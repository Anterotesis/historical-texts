<P><HI>And this, Royall Sir, is my humble reque&s;t to your &s;aered Maje&s;ty at this time; That you will graciou&s;ly accept a</HI> mean gift <HI>from a</HI> mean giver,
<PB REF="3"><HI>and by your royall return of ju&s;tice and bountie to enable me to &s;erve God, and your Maje&s;ty with better; God him&s;elf inviting you thereto by his example, who allowed even of</HI> poor freewill|offerings, <HI>made to him of purpo&s;e, to obtain his bountifull returns of &s;ome eminent benefits or fa|vours. And yet</HI> a mean gift, <HI>Sir, I call this of mine, not that the</HI> work it &s;elf <HI>&s;hould be &s;o ac|counted, but</HI> my work about it; <HI>which is but a Tran&s;lation. For the Book though in bulke but &s;mall, in its concernments is very rich; and, as highly commendable in it &s;elf, &s;o not much le&s;s in the Author. In its natural language it made its fir&s;t addre&s;s to Cardinal</HI> Mazarine, <HI>in order to have &s;et his Maje&s;ty of</HI> France <HI>on conque&s;t of the great Kingdome of the</HI> Amazone <HI>to him&s;elf. But having the&s;e five years at least, that now it hath been abroad, not made u&s;e of it that way, it comes now by me to beg your Maje&s;ties favourable ac|ceptance, in hope of that large retribution to your &s;elf, when your Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit to apply your thoughts to it, for which it was intended to another. It was by an old &s;ervant of your Ma|je&s;ties Royall Fathers, and Gandfathers,</HI> I. L. D. <HI>brought over, and communicate to one of your Ma|je&s;ties mo&s;t expert Seamen,</HI> C. W. <HI>who from his youth up, and often times &s;ince, hath been in, and knowes perfectly all the coa&s;ts of the</HI> Southern A|merica. <HI>Both the&s;e are very confident, at lea&s;t wi&s;h heartily, and my &s;elf with the like affection do now humbly pre&s;ent it al&s;o, That your Maje&s;ty would &s;o con&s;ider of that great Empire, as if it</HI>
<PB REF="4"><HI>were already your own; as it may be with much ea&s;e, if your applications be &s;ea&s;onable, and &s;uita|ble to its worth. For it is po&s;&s;e&s;t by the barbarous Natives only, except in two</HI> Skirts; Bra&s;ile <HI>on the Ea&s;t, where the</HI> Portuguai&s;e <HI>pitched; and</HI> Peru <HI>upon the We&s;t, where the</HI> Spaniard <HI>is divided from the</HI> Inland <HI>by the tract of the</HI> Andes, <HI>or</HI> Cor|deliere hills: <HI>but in the</HI> Penin&s;ular <HI>great conti|nent your Maje&s;ty may dre&s;&s;e an</HI> Empire <HI>of near nine thou&s;and miles in circuit, of the plea&s;ante&s;t, fertile&s;t, and riche&s;t continent in the world, whe|ther for air, waters, or &s;oil; to which no Prince can pretend, much le&s;s lay a claim. For the di&s;co|veries of that River by the</HI> Portugai&s;e, <HI>and</HI> Spa|niards, <HI>were more to &s;atisfie their curio&s;ity, than that they could then hope for a conque&s;t. And the Natives not only in their forlorn condition, but by &s;ingular junctures of providence, call for the Chri&s;tian Religion from us, while others cea&s;e from that duty, as the man of</HI> Macedon <HI>did</HI> Paul <HI>to help them while he was hindred to go into</HI> Bithy|nia, <HI>Act. 16.7, 9, 10. and others have been hin|dred hitherto to go to them for &s;uch end; but they may al&s;o ea&s;ily be made to receive your Ma|je&s;ties Government with friend&s;hip, if wi&s;ely dealt with. For while neither</HI> Portugall, <HI>nor</HI> Spain, <HI>nor</HI> France <HI>pur&s;ued the de&s;ign here offered, God in in his providence amid&s;t, your Maje&s;ties and your good Subjects troubles, &s;eems not ob&s;curely to have been de&s;igning this for you, and your</HI> Brittain; <HI>as may be hoped from</HI> ancient prediction, <HI>not liable to exception from the &s;olide&s;t and &s;obere&s;t wits (as
<PB REF="4">at another occa&s;ion I may fullier clear, if your Ma|je&s;ty command it) and &s;o much the more, as his providence hath prevented your projecting, having already made way and brought to pa&s;s for your Maje&s;ties intere&s;t an opportune and con&s;iderable Colonie, by that noble Lord</HI> Willoughbee <HI>of</HI> Parham, <HI>to his great travels, hazards, and vast expen&s;es; both &s;eeming to concurre with the fore|&s;aid prediction, and to point out your Maje&s;ty for the layer of &s;uch a foundation both to Chri&s;t, and your &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Author of this work is a French Earl of a mo&s;t ancient Nobility and de&s;cent from tho&s;e famous and honourable Commanders in the holy Warres, who for their wi&s;e conduct and rare valour were imployed in places of great tru&s;t, and tran&s;mitted them with the Coat of arms and name of</HI> Pagan, <HI>(which was the badge of their great exploits in mating and killing the</HI> Pagans, <HI>or</HI> Infidels) <HI>to their &s;uece&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame</HI> name <HI>and</HI> family, <HI>as the Author him&s;elf &s;howes at large in the Dedicati|on of his rare Book of Fortifications, to another noble branch of the &s;ame family: of who&s;e rare ac|compli&s;hments for</HI> gentile <HI>and</HI> manly learning, <HI>and</HI> Souldiery, <HI>le&s;t I &s;hould here pre&s;ume too much upon your Maje&s;ties patience, I &s;hall leave further account of him to my Epi&s;tle to the Reader, and only pre&s;ent your Maje&s;ty with the &s;umme of what he &s;ayes to the</HI> Cardinal <HI>about the conque&s;t; and that is;</HI> <Q><HI>That it will neither be</HI> hard <HI>nor</HI> expen&s;ive, <HI>as neither needing great Armies, to give battels; nor great provi&s;ion of Artillery, for carrying on</HI>
<PB REF="5"><HI>of &s;ieges. There is need only of preparations fit|ting for planting of five Colonies at the fir&s;t a|board. The fir&s;t whereof is to be in the</HI> I&s;le of the Sun, <HI>for guarding the be&s;t entrie into the great Rivers mouth. The &s;econd on the famous</HI> Bo&s;phore <HI>or</HI> Strait <HI>thereof, to defend, or keep this Rivers pa&s;&s;age. The third on the renowned</HI> point <HI>of the</HI> Comanares, <HI>for the be&s;t &s;eat of that whole Empire. The fourth near to the moun|tain of</HI> Swana, <HI>whereby to be ma&s;ter of the gold|mine there. And the fifth and la&s;t on the mouth of the River of</HI> Maragnon, <HI>to watch over the Frontier of that &s;ide of the</HI> Andes. <HI>And in fa|vours of &s;uch a fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, there might ea&s;ily be added the</HI> alliances <HI>of the Illu&s;trious and renowned Nations of the</HI> Homagues, <HI>of the generous and noble</HI> Yorimans, <HI>of the vali|ant and redoubted</HI> Topinambes; <HI>and order given for a</HI> Fleet-volant <HI>of about twelve men of Warre, continually to be vi&s;iting, and going between the&s;e Colonies: becau&s;e the di&s;tance by &s;ailing, of the farthe&s;t of them from the others, will be at the lea&s;t a thou&s;and Spani&s;h leagues and alwayes upon the channell of the great</HI> Ama|zone <HI>it &s;elf.</HI></Q> <HI>Thus he.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I call my gift al&s;o, a mean gift from</HI> a mean giver; <HI>not that I was, or am &s;o</HI> mean <HI>in my &s;elf, as</HI> made &s;o <HI>by the late troubles, and troublers of the times. For, Royall Sir, my Father Sir</HI> Robert Hamilton <HI>of</HI> Go&s;wick, <HI>was Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber both to your Royall Father and Grandfather; and my Mother was by King</HI>
<PB REF="5">James <HI>him&s;elf preferred to his Queen, for one of her Maids of honour, and afterwards al&s;o by him|&s;elf be&s;towed in marriage upon Sir</HI> Hadrian Dam|mane, <HI>Lord</HI> Bi&s;terveldt <HI>and</HI> Fair-hill; <HI>after who&s;e decea&s;e my Father married her. My Fa|ther, and any e&s;tate I &s;hould have had by him, I lo&s;t through the troubles of the times; and have wanted them now the&s;e &s;eventeen years; for repa|ration whereof, and coming hither to wait for it, I left one place of con&s;iderable value in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and &s;pent here in three years attendance for repara|tion, what I could then bring with me; and then embracing another place here in</HI> England, <HI>not much wor&s;e than the former, was not only again put from it, before I had enjoyed it full two years to an end, for keeping my fidelity to your Maje&s;ty in refu&s;ing to &s;ub&s;cribe an engagement, or allegi|ance (for &s;o it was indeed, whatever they called it) to another Soveraignty; but &s;uffered al&s;o four or five years bani&s;hment, to the almo&s;t irreparable de|triment of my health and e&s;tate both; yea, and re|fu&s;ed all preferments from the u&s;urpers, and the lea&s;t compliances with them, both before my ba|ni&s;hment, and now for &s;even years after, though I was wooed thereto, and might have got con&s;ide|rable advancement with ea&s;e, could I have embra|ced it with complyance; but would never &s;o much as commence &s;uit under them; though but for re|covering &s;ome debts, or defending my &s;elf from others unju&s;t pur&s;uits. And that the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, Sir, wherein con&s;i&s;ted all my e&s;tate, and that a con&s;ide|rable one too, when your Maje&s;ty &s;hall know the
<PB REF="6">particulars, &s;hould make me poor, is little wonder; and that poverty through its di&s;advantages, and my former di&s;parity of life, &s;hould ruine my health, is as little wonder; and that all the di&s;advantages, that a ruined health, and poverty can bring a man to, &s;hould di&s;able me to do &s;uch thing as otherwi&s;e I could, and would have done, to pre&s;ent your Ma|je&s;ty with, is yet as little &s;trange, as the former: but that I &s;hould yet be alive, poor as I am, to offer this poor gift unto your Maje&s;ty,</HI> that is the wonder. <HI>And indeed it is Gods good hand to|wards me, whom I hope he hath re&s;erved for doing him&s;elf, and your Maje&s;ty &s;ome greater &s;ervice, before I be called hence. For, Royall Sir, God hath not made me &s;o</HI> poor <HI>in gifts of minde, (of which as I may not brag, but by glorying in him, and in my infirmities or &s;ufferings for him; &s;o may I not</HI> ungratefully <HI>conceal, le&s;&s;en, or undervalue to his di&s;honour, what they are, but with mode&s;ty confe&s;s, when ju&s;t occa&s;ion flagitates and extorts it from me) through his ble&s;&s;ing, if your Maje&s;ty will but pa|tronize me (I &s;hall not &s;ay</HI> Mecaenas-<HI>like; for that is too little for you, though it was truely &s;aid of him,</HI> Mecaenas atavis edite regibus! <HI>but</HI> Angu&s;tus <HI>like rather, beyond whom him&s;elf your Maje&s;ty is in this al&s;o, that you can number more Kings of your Progenitors, than were in all the Roman race of Kings, and Emperors both, either before, or after</HI> Augu&s;tus <HI>to this day) I hope to honour your Maje&s;ty with &s;uch gifts of mine own &s;tore, as never a King in Chri&s;tendome for the&s;e &s;ixteen hundred years, ever had Subject, that did
<PB REF="6">the like, though many have attempted,</HI> ab&s;int &amp; jactantia, &amp; invidia verbo: <HI>but your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t midwife them, and my &s;elf both into the world again, and then by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall I renew my &s;trength and youth, as the Eagle,</HI> &amp; &s;ublimi feriam &s;idera vertice.</P>
<P><HI>If here it be wondred, that thus I implore your Maje&s;ties ju&s;tice and favour, and made not ra|ther a privater addre&s;s, for repairing of my lo&s;&s;es; I &s;hall humbly and truely profe&s;s, that I have not left privater wayes unattempted; but finde all &s;o ob&s;tructed with difficulties, and non-con&s;iderancies, or cold layings to heart of my ca&s;e, that neither the health of my body, nor the &s;trength of my pur&s;e would &s;uffer me to hope for much good otherwayes, and from Courtiers, than thus by u&s;hering in my Petition; and then I hope more &s;ea&s;onably, and &s;uccesfully to reap the fruits of a privater appli|cation. I thought often of that cour&s;e, that the poor Widow took with</HI> Philip <HI>of</HI> Macedon, <HI>the Fa|ther of</HI> Alexander <HI>the Great: who when &s;he had attempted by</HI> Courtiers, <HI>and</HI> Favourites <HI>to get ju&s;tice done her, but could not prevail with them to preferre her bu&s;ine&s;s to the</HI> King; <HI>re&s;olved to attaque him her &s;elf, the be&s;t &s;he could, come of it what would; though of him at wor&s;t, &s;he hoped much better, than of any of his Courtiers, as I al|&s;o do of your Maje&s;ty now. Ca&s;ting her &s;elf there|fore in his way, when &s;he knew, he was to ride out, with high vociferations &s;he cryed after him,</HI> Help my Lord, O King; help O King! <HI>He com|manding to &s;tand, and &s;ee what ailed her; &s;he</HI>
<PB REF="7"><HI>de&s;ired him to read and an&s;wer her Petition with ju&s;tice. He an&s;wering that it was unfit then, and that he had not lea&s;ure for it; &s;he replyed up|on him boldly, That then</HI> he &s;hould not be at lea&s;ure to be King, <HI>if he could not have lea&s;ure to right his meane&s;t Subjects, when all their pa|tience and endeavours were otherwayes fru&s;trate and wearied out. Upon which he was &s;o far from being di&s;&s;atisfied with her, that rather admiring her re&s;olution, he mo&s;t generou&s;ly and heroickly gave her a pre&s;ent hearing, and full right of her wrong. Sir, my way is not &s;o cour&s;e, as hers was, but by a gift (which both with God, and all noble&s;t &s;pirits among men, finds acceptance) though but a poor onee, to have the &s;ofter acce&s;s to your Maje&s;ties favour, and a cordialler con&s;ideration of my ca&s;e, when it comes to your Maje&s;ty in a more particu|lar way; and an ea&s;ier grant of privacy for imme|diate imparting your Maje&s;ty with &s;ome things, which is more for your Maje&s;ties good, than for my particular. Thus wi&s;e</HI> Abigail <HI>not only pacified</HI> David <HI>towards an unthankefull and churli&s;h</HI> Na|bal, <HI>but made way for her &s;elf for &s;uch a &s;urplu&s;|&s;age of favour, as &s;he little dreamed of, to become a Kings wife, and royal bedfellow, and her i&s;&s;ue pre|ferred in the entail of the Crowr, before all other of</HI> Davids <HI>children, except</HI> Bath&s;hebaes. <HI>It is re ported of</HI> Alexander Severus, <HI>the Emperour, b</HI>|Aelius Lampridius <HI>in his life, that be quarrelledy with every vertuous per&s;on, that be knew, who ei|ther a&s;ked nothing of him, or but little.</HI> Quid e&s;t (inquit) quod nihil petis? An me vis tibi fieri
<PB REF="7">debitorem? Why ask you nothing of me? Would you have me to die in your debt? <HI>Sir, le&s;t I pre&s;ume too much upon your Maje&s;ties great affairs, in exceeding the bounds of an Epi&s;tle to &s;o great a Prince, for the length whereof already I humbly beg pardon, my hopes and de&s;ires are that you &s;hall not come &s;hort of any of tho&s;e Worthies, or of the mo&s;t heroick Princes, but &s;urmount them all, in all royall endowments, to your becoming the Crown and rejoycing of all the</HI> reformed, <HI>in pro&s;e|cuting their intere&s;t, which is Gods, and becoming their</HI> uniter <HI>and</HI> head, <HI>that you may be</HI> Carolo magno major, <HI>as undoubtedly you will, if thus you do: and which that you may do, Long may your Maje&s;ty live in all piety, plenty, and peace; or el&s;e ju&s;t and happy triumphs here; and hereafter in the joyes and triumphs of heaven, where there is nothing but glory, triumphs, and joy without end.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_I</HI> Mu&s;t give thee &s;ome more account of the Author of this Booke, and of its worth, and of my &s;elf, his Tran&s;latour, and &s;o bid thee farewell. About the Author, I &s;hall not repeat, what hath been &s;aid of him before, in my Dedication to his Ma|je&s;ty for his ju&s;t commendation, and of this Book of his in particular, but referre thee thither, if thou art de&s;irous to know it. I &s;hall here only adde, That he was in great employment and favour with the late King of <HI>France, Lewis</HI> the thirteenth, for his great parts of conduct and valour in his &s;ervice; wherein unfortunately he received a &s;hot of a Pi&s;toll in the left eye, whereby it was quite lo&s;t, and the conjugation of the optick nerves &s;o cru&s;hed, that he hath lo&s;t the u&s;e of both now above the&s;e twenty yeares: yet, which is wonder|full,
<PB REF="9">is &s;till penning new Books, and in Mathe|maticks e&s;pecially, which indeed needs lea&s;t the outward &s;en&s;e; among&s;t which is that ma&s;ter|piece, The ten Books of Geometricall Theorems, wherein he compleated and demon&s;trated &s;o many diver&s;e, and di&s;tinct parts of Mathematicall Sciences. His Book of the theory of Planets is Geometrically demon&s;trated, without any mixture of Phy&s;icall equations, by which <HI>Reignoldus</HI> and <HI>Kepler</HI> laboured &s;o much to perfect the Geometricall, wherein their deferents, and Epicicles could not &s;erve their turn. But this Gentleman hath found out both the center of the Planets, and demon|&s;trated their motions to be ellipticall, which no man afore him could attain to. And in con&s;e|quence to his theory, he publi&s;hed A&s;tronomicall tables two yeares ago, wherein with great facility and exactne&s;s, the motions of all the Planets may be &s;upputate, the Eclip&s;es of the two great lumi|naries, and the cele&s;tiall configurations: and in con&s;equence to them, a facile method of finding out the true longitudes, both by &s;ea, and land. His more than ordinary skill in Geography, may be &s;een by his two Adverti&s;ements to Geographers, at the end of this Booke, and by the Book it &s;elf: where|in with great judgement and brevity he hath given an excellent, and the clearc&s;t de&s;cription of a great part of <HI>America,</HI> that any where is to be had: he having collected this out of all the be&s;t relations, and di&s;coveries, that were extant; and corrected their errors, adding a Mapp of his own. All which his Pieces here mentioned, and in my Dedi|cation
<PB REF="9">to his Maje&s;ty &s;hall be by me made Engli&s;h Denizens, if this be well accepted, and the other required.

<PB REF="12">names of <HI>civill tities</HI> entailed upon riches and de|&s;cent, by creation, or patent. Certainly there is a wi&s;dome, if we &s;tudied it as well, as &s;ome do the other, of having a <HI>noble breed</HI> of men and women, as well as there is of <HI>Hor&s;es, Cocks,</HI> and Cattle. None will think <HI>dunghill-Cockrell,</HI> fit for game; nor a <HI>jadi&s;h</HI> race for the &s;ervices of a gallant <HI>Jen|net:</HI> and yet we think any thing <HI>fit enough</HI> for our Progenie's, that hath but money enough. High birth and fortunes, are in them&s;elves, both of them, the good ble&s;&s;ings of God, and are in honour with all per&s;ons of honour, where ever they are, or have been in any, that have &s;uitable vertues, but have parted with fortunes for vertues &s;ake. But for a Gentleman who&s;e fortunes are become un&s;uita|ble to his ranke, whether by his own fault, or o|thers, or by neither, but by wrong, or misfortune, for reparation of an e&s;tate, &s;o far to forget him&s;elf, as to make money his <HI>leading motive</HI> in a choice, is <HI>ignoble</HI> enough, and ungenerous, and can hardly expect better fruits of his way. We know, he was a wi&s;e man, that &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O land, when thy King is the &s;on of nobles!</HI> Eccle&s;. <HI>10.7.</HI> And he that &s;aid, <HI>Nam genus, &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ip&s;i, vix ea no&s;tra voco,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to too much &s;tanding on, or vaunting of de&s;cent without competent vertue and wi&s;dome to corre&s;pond with it; &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>Et Mi genus ab Jove &s;ummo,</HI> to &s;how his e&s;teem of de&s;cent; and with virtue an|&s;werable; especially of &s;uch a de&s;cent, as claimed to the be&s;t, that could be reckoned to. He that would be a&s;hamed to claim &s;o honourable a privi|ledge,
<PB REF="12">if he can do it truely, and hath ju&s;t occa&s;ion and circum&s;tances to extort it from him, would &s;how but him&s;elf too mode&s;t at be&s;t, and almo&s;t un|worthy of it, e&s;pecially if he had a better <HI>Jupiter</HI> in place to make both his addre&s;s and claim to, than the other had. For as low as my fortunes are, I can claim to the be&s;t blood in <HI>England,</HI> and that by <HI>England,</HI> and neither very far off, nor in an ille|gitimate way. Neither need I to be a&s;hamed of my fortunes (though hitherto, which was my weak|ne&s;s, I have been a&s;hamed of them, whereas I ought not to have been a&s;hamed, but of &s;in) &s;eeing I part|ed from them willingly, for retaining to vertue, and a good con&s;cience. <HI>Solomon</HI> hath told me, that <HI>all things come alike to all;</HI> and that the <HI>race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battell to the &s;trong, nor bread to the wi&s;e, nor riches to men of un|der&s;tanding, nor favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all,</HI> Eccle&s;. <HI>9.2, 11, &amp;c.</HI> I was never lower yet, than that great and noble <HI>Generall,</HI> of that great Emperour <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> was unju&s;tly brought, to his ma&s;ters no little disprai&s;e, <HI>Beli&s;arius</HI> of immortall renown. And why &s;hould I be a&s;hamed to lay open my ca&s;e to &s;o <HI>Royall</HI> a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> as I have done; or be diffi|dent of the <HI>cure,</HI> &s;ince the fountain of civil honour (which he is) will do nothing contrary to true ho|nour; and Gods <HI>Great Steward</HI> of fortunes and pre|ferments, that are in his own gift, in his own do|minions, will neither deal niggardly, ungenerou&s;ly, or unju&s;tly, where nothing but ju&s;tice and right is &s;ought? Far be any thing of this, from being ta|ken
<PB REF="13">as contrary to the fir&s;t founders of a noble race; who, though they cannot claim <HI>de&s;cent,</HI> yet are beyond mo&s;t of tho&s;e, that can: &s;ince it is more to <HI>give,</HI> or <HI>make</HI> a noble de&s;cent, than to <HI>receive</HI> it, and mo&s;t <HI>cadets,</HI> prove oftner <HI>cadents,</HI> than <HI>culminants,</HI> and &s;eldome equall their <HI>found|ers,</HI> but <HI>un&s;pirit</HI> them&s;elves, and <HI>evaporate</HI> to a <HI>vappidne&s;s</HI> of money&mdash;or <HI>prediall-gentility.</HI> I mean not &s;o much that, which is bought with mo|my (for that may be &s;o, where it de&s;erved to have been given) as that which hath nothing but riches to &s;u&s;tain it. <HI>Cicero</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Salu&s;tius</HI> his ob|jection of an up&s;tart, well, (if we &s;uppo&s;e the in|vectives to be theirs) <HI>Ego meis majoribus virtute praeluxi; Tu tuis turpiter offudi&s;ti tenebras.</HI> And as for occupations, and offices, though &s;ome be ju&s;tly accounted more <HI>fordid,</HI> and <HI>illiberall;</HI> others more honourable and gentile; yet all that are law|full, coming from God, and from his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as the&s;e mentioned, and implyed, <HI>Exod. 31.3.</HI> &amp;c. none joyned with virtue, can ju&s;tly <HI>ignobili|tate</HI> any. Yea, I know none of the ba&s;e&s;t and meane&s;t of them, but in conjunction with <HI>virtue,</HI> and <HI>piety,</HI> but especially when they come to put on &s;ome|thing of the nature of piety it &s;elf, or <HI>immediate &s;ervice</HI> to God, as &s;ome of them did under the Old Te&s;tament, God hath left place for them to be <HI>pareille to,</HI> or in conjunction with the highe&s;t. Thus <HI>David</HI> wi&s;hed rather to be a doorkeeper in the hou&s;e of his God (a Porter of the Temple) than to be a King in the Tents of wickedne&s;s. And to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his po&s;terity, though King in <HI>Je&s;hurun,</HI> yea
<PB REF="13">more than a King, a King, Prie&s;t and Prophet, which is more than ever we read of any other (ex|cept Chri&s;t, of whom be was therein a &s;ingular Type; ever a typicall <HI>Mediatour,</HI> for be con&s;e|crated <HI>Aaron</HI> to his Prie&s;thood, which without being <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> he could not have dine) yet there was no more allotted to them, but to be <HI>chief Porters</HI> in the hou&s;e of God. What calling meaner than a <HI>Butcher?</HI> Yet the High-Prie&s;t, the &s;econd per&s;on in the Kingdome, and &s;ometimes, and in &s;ome re|&s;pects, the fir&s;t, was by his calling a <HI>&s;acred Butch|er;</HI> and if I be not mi&s;taken, as I hope in my Scrip|turall re&s;earches I may &s;how, that I am not, the King him&s;elf in &s;ome ca&s;es, was &s;uch a &s;acred Butcher in &s;ome &s;ort, in that he killed his own &s;a|crifices; and it was an high, and an eminent ho|nour to him too; and ever bad been accounted, as the <HI>priviledge of the fir&s;t-born,</HI> where the excel|lency of dignity, and of power was by divine in&s;ti|tution, before the <HI>Jewes</HI> policy was erected. A Preacher of this City, that now bears his head high, when a Gentleman &s;howed him, (as I have heard from the Party) a Tract by him done into Latine, and &s;ub&s;cribed in the Title-page, <HI>Per A. B. Nobi|lem,</HI> &amp;c. he very &s;matterer-like, and pedantick|ly bewryed his ignorance, that <HI>nobilis</HI> in Roman and pure&s;t Latine phra&s;e, that we could have, &s;ig|nified a <HI>Gentleman;</HI> but he would not under&s;tand it otherwayes, but according to the <HI>Angli&s;m</HI> that he was acquainted with, whereby <HI>Nobleman</HI> is ap|propriate to Barons, Vicounts, Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A|nother per&s;on of quality in this City (as I have
<PB REF="14">heard the Story) ri&s;ing from a mean degree to great fortunes, had a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Gentleman (without the Gentlemans own knowledge) recommended to his company and Table: and thereupon the Citi|zen him&s;elf inviting him too, he well accepted of it, and was as well taken with; and upon fur|ther conver&s;e, &s;o well, that he ju&s;tly apprehended &s;ome more than ordinary favours towards him, if he would lay hold on them. To lay hold he was mo&s;t willing, and did; but re&s;olved to proceed cantiou&s;ly and &s;lowly, for many Rea&s;ons, which if they had known, or had the patience, till di&s;creetly they might have been opened to them, they would have allowed of. But they con&s;truing this <HI>&s;low|ne&s;s</HI> for <HI>neglect,</HI> were offended, and that &s;o far, that at length (the Gentleman not finding it be&s;t to alter his procedure) the Citizen di&s;charged him his hou&s;e, though upon a contrary pretence. He took this as an high affront, as indeed it was. And they coming to know their mi&s;take, invited him a|gain, but &s;o un&s;ufficiently, the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e being excepted from being the <HI>inviter,</HI> though he had been the <HI>di&s;charger,</HI> that the Gentleman would not thereupon come &s;o &s;oon, as it &s;eems, they expected him; but he did ca&s;t him&s;elf to meet with them, where he might either have a fuller invitati|on from them that had the right, or opportunity to tell them, what an one their <HI>Deputy</HI> had given him. But he found them in a new di&s;content and mi&s;take upon refu&s;all of that invitation, which increa&s;ed to &s;uch <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> that it could not be removed, through their too high carriage; which he di&s;dained
<PB REF="14">the more, the higher it was; untill at length going about to beget a right under&s;tanding again, be re|ceived &s;uch another &s;ignall affront, as he vowed never to enter their hou&s;e, untill be knew he had a <HI>full</HI> and free invitation that came from him that di&s;charged him. Matters &s;tanding thus now, the Gentleman, to whom I could not deny &s;uch a cour|te&s;ie, for many rea&s;ons; reque&s;ted me, <HI>That thus in a cloud</HI> to others, I would find a way as &s;oon as I could, to <HI>uncloud</HI> his bu&s;ine&s;s briefly to the par|ties concerned, that they might make &s;uch u&s;e thereof, as they &s;aw good. And I have cho&s;en this way of examples &s;ubjoyned to the di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>ge|nero&s;ity,</HI> by way of Apology for my &s;elf, and fir&s;t opening my condition from that ob&s;curity it lay un|der, to prevent, or repul&s;e the curri&s;h &s;narls of <HI>clowni&s;h Pedants,</HI> and <HI>Schioli&s;ts.</HI> My intent in this Tran&s;lation, is (be&s;ide what I have expre&s;t to his Maje&s;ty) the propagation of Religion, and the good of <HI>England.</HI> But if Religion be not better in|tended, and attended, and pro&s;ecuted by underta|kers, than it hath been at home, it may ju&s;tly fru&s;trate all, and ca&s;t us in as great confu&s;ions a|broad, as it did at home. But becau&s;e this would require more length, than this Epi&s;tle is now fit to be drawn unto, and I may have another occa&s;ion for it perhaps, ere long; I heartily recommend all to Gods ble&s;&s;ing, and thy good acceptance, and bid thee farewell.</P>

<P>THe innumerable Nations and Provin|ces of this great Empire of the <HI>Ama|zone</HI> are not all yet di&s;tinctly known by their &s;everall names and languages, becau&s;e the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who la&s;t navigated this fa|mous River, have not marked them all, but only one hundred and fifty of them. The Provinces are all &s;o mightily, peopled, and their habitations &s;o thick, that from the la&s;t village of one Town, one may hear the noi&s;e of &s;uch as travail from the fir&s;t vil|lage of anopher. And yet &s;o near a neigh|bour hood not being able to keep them in peace, they are in continuall Warres one Nation again&s;t another. Yet neither am|bition of command, nor greedine&s;s of acqui|ring riches, not a de&s;ire to eat men, as Ca|nibals of the &s;ame <HI>America</HI> have, are any of the grounds of &s;o many cruell and bloody Battels; (without which were it not, for all this, &s;o many people could never be contain|ed in the&s;e Countries) but the cau&s;e of all the&s;e Fights, wherein are often &s;lain an in|finitie

<P>SEing neither Steel nor Iron are found at all in the We&s;t-<HI>Indies,</HI> we mu&s;t not marvell, if the <HI>Americans</HI> of this great Kingdom have no other Arms, but Ar|rows and Javelots; about which notwith|&s;tanding they are marvellou&s;ly expert, not only for making them of hard wood, and &s;harp pointed, but al&s;o for &s;hooting and ca&s;ting them with &s;o great force, that there|with they pierce through and through the body of their enemies, which they hit. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity makes them al&s;o u&s;e &s;tones well brought to an edge, and Tor|toi&s;e &s;hells, for Axes, and Hatchets, and their in&s;truments of travelling: the one for great wood, and the other for le&s;s, and hou&s;hold Uten&s;ils. But they u&s;e the horn of certain little Bea&s;ts, fa&s;tned to little hefts, for their finer works, which they make upon wood with marvellous skill. As for the Commerce of all the&s;e peoples on this great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and on other Rivers that run into it, they perform
<PB N="9" REF="22">it in Boats, which they call <HI>Cano&egrave;s,</HI> that are made all of Cedar, and all of one piece, as in other places of the <HI>Indies;</HI> but with more ea&s;e, and better, than el&s;ewhere; be|cau&s;e this great River during its overflow|ings, brings down &s;o great a number of great Trees, that the&s;e peoples have no more to do to come by them, but every one to lay hold on, and &s;tay as many as he de&s;ires, at his Hou&s;e, there to cut and hol|low them, as he thinks meet.

<P>THere were never any written Laws a|mong&s;t tho&s;e peoples; and all their cu&s;tomes are almo&s;t much alike. Some of them live at liberty; and &s;ome of them un|der Cacyques, or Lords, as the re&s;t of <HI>A|merica.</HI> They have Idols of wood made
<PB N="10" REF="23">by mans hand, which they adore as their gods, attributing to &s;ome of them the pow|er over waters, and giving them a Fi&s;h for their mark: to others the power over fruits, and &s;eeds of the earth. They have al&s;o &s;uch as they take for gods of Armies and Battels; and they openly avouch that the&s;e deities came down from Heaven to live with them, to do them good, and procure their profit. They have neither Temples nor Ceremonies, wherewith they adore them, but leave them carele&s;ly in &s;ome corner of their Hou&s;e, untill they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e them. But when they take water to go to Warre, they place on the Poup of their Ve&s;&s;els, their god of Armies; and &s;o they u&s;e the others in like &s;ort.

But the&s;e two &s;pring-heads, the mo&s;t won|derfull of all the world, &s;ince they give the beginning to the mo&s;t memorable River of the univer&s;all world, run quickly into one, and pa&s;s along together the terrible rocks of the <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> rolling their roaring waters over its precipices and fals: from whence this great River coming forth and running alwayes &s;trong, &s;wift, and &s;traight towards the Ea&s;t, receives pre&s;ently upon his leav|ing the <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> a marvellous great in|crea&s;e from the <HI>Coca,</HI> the <HI>Payamine,</HI> and the <HI>Napo,</HI> (three con&s;iderable Rivers, whereof we &s;hall &s;peak el&s;e where) and in &s;hort while makes his navigablene&s;s like un|to that of the great Ocean-Sea, as well for

<P>AFter that the great <HI>Amazone</HI> hath made his channell like unto that of the greate&s;t Rivers of the world, by the conflux of the fore&s;aid three Rivers, he goes on his way through the va&s;t and fertile fields of <HI>America,</HI> alwayes towards the Ea&s;t, and without longer &s;traying from under the Line, than five or &s;ix degrees at the mo&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="26">on the South&s;ide, or that of the antarctick Pole. Yet drawing his now-&s;low waters after him, by infinite turnings and windings in plains and fields of &s;o large and great ex|tent, he ca&s;ts out his arms on every &s;ide to receive the more ea&s;ily the Rivers which from all parts come unto him, and that with &s;uch admirable agreement, that the lea&s;t of his armes receive alway the lea&s;t Rivers and Rivulets; and the greater the greater: and if Rivers come to him, that are bigge and made great by a cour&s;e of more hundreths of Leagues together, he there &s;huts up all his waters into one channell, to receive tho&s;e greater worthily, and as it were with a great|er &s;tate and magnificence. As for his length from his &s;ource to his mouth at the <HI>Atlantique</HI>-Sea, following the cour&s;e of his wide channell, it is diver&s;ly reported. The fore-mentioned <HI>Areillane</HI> makes it of eigh|teen hundred, and Father <HI>D' Acogna</HI> of one thou&s;and two hundred &s;eventy &s;ix <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leagues, according to the ju&s;te&s;t mea&s;ures that we could gather from the Relations of this Author, who contradicts him&s;elf often through forgetfulne&s;s, and not taking heed. Now the &s;paringe&s;t reckoning of Father <HI>D' Acogna,</HI> being mode&s;ter than that of
<PB N="17" REF="26"><HI>Areillane,</HI> &s;eems to me to have more ap|pearances of the truth in it; becau&s;e the di&s;tance of the mountains of <HI>Pulcan,</HI> and <HI>Guanama</HI> (where the Sources of this great River are) in a &s;treight line unto <HI>Zaparara,</HI> which is the Ea&s;terlie&s;t Cape, at which he ends his cour&s;e, is but of &s;ix hundred four|ty leagues of the &s;ame &s;ort, according to my Geographick Tables or Mappes, and the methods of the eighth Book of my Ge|ometricall Theorems. But becau&s;e this di|&s;tance in a &s;treight line, appears to me to be yet too farre different from the fore&s;aid length of one thou&s;and two hundred &s;eventy &s;ix leagues; I could ea&s;ily per&s;wade my &s;elf, that either the Southern longitude of <HI>America</HI> were greater; or that the leagues of this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Father Je&s;uit &s;hould be no o|ther but <HI>Celtiberian-Spani&s;h</HI> leagues, or <HI>Bi&s;|cay leagues,</HI> like unto our French-&s;ea-leagues, the which amounting but to twenty, for every degree of a great circle, would give us &s;even hundred thirty two leagues in a right or &s;treight line, for the &s;ame di&s;tance be|tween the Sources of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and the extremity of his mouth, or up&s;hutting.</P>

But the greater part of the&s;e Iles, and &s;ometimes the greate&s;t of them, are in part at lea&s;t drowned and overflowed every year by the inundations of that River, but &s;o fatned thereafter with the mud, that he &s;catters o|ver them behind him, that they are there|by exceeding fertile, yielding every year without any intermi&s;&s;ions of re&s;t, their or|dinary crops, which are of <HI>Maze, Yoca,</HI> and <HI>Mandioca;</HI> which yeeld the common food for all <HI>America,</HI> where it is in great abun|dance all along the great River of the <HI>Ama|zone.</HI> But to help the inconveniences of overflowing, they make under-ground Cel|lers, Granaries, or Caves well cover'd, where they keep their <HI>Maze,</HI> (which is their wheat) without impairement; and the <HI>Yo|ca</HI> (which is a root) whereof they make their <HI>Ca&s;abe,</HI> which is the ordinary, and le&s;&s;e fini&s;h bread of all <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> and of all that New-world.

<P>SEeing the great and wonderfull Channell of the renowned River of the <HI>Ama|zones,</HI> as a certain long and va&s;t Sea of &s;weet waters, receives &s;o many great, broad, and deep Rivers, we mu&s;t not think it &s;trange, if the depth of his bed equall often|times the Aby&s;&s;es of the Ocean its &s;elf. This is for the mo&s;t part, from his beginning unto <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> of eight, twelve, and of twenty <HI>fathomes;</HI> and from <HI>Rio-negro</HI> down|wards to the Ocean, of thirty, fourty, and &s;ometimes without ground, and unfathom|able, according to the relations of all that
<PB N="29" REF="32">have ob&s;erved it. But this marvellous ad|vantage his depth hath beyond others &s;ingu|lar, that for the mo&s;t part they are alike, along the bankes and &s;ides, as they are in the mid&s;t of this large Channell of the great <HI>Amazone:</HI> whence it follows, that his Na|vigablene&s;&s;e, and the fitne&s;&s;e for commerce of this great River, is open and &s;ufficient enough for the greate&s;t Navies, of the greate&s;t number, of the greate&s;t burthen; which may not only &s;ail up all along him to his fir&s;t ri&s;e in order of Battell, and ready for fight; but al&s;o put to Land ea&s;ily, and apply to the &s;hore, without any fear of rocks, or &s;ands. And Providence having purpo|&s;ed every way to render all the&s;e wonders yet more con&s;iderable, hath led the waters of this famous River alwaies from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, and near unto the <HI>Aequator,</HI> to the end, that as <HI>Navale</HI> Armies might ea&s;ily come down from his very &s;ource to his mouth, carryed by the &s;weet force and &s;trength of his current, and &s;treame; &s;o they might al&s;o as ea&s;ily go up from his mouth and fir&s;t entrance unto his very &s;ource, again&s;t the &s;tream of his deep wa|ters, by a favourable and continual winde, which blows there in a good gale perpetual|ly,

Without &s;taying therefore to cen&s;ure a Per&s;on of his Noble|ne&s;&s;e and merit, by rea&s;ons which I might, and the curious may them&s;elves perceive in his writings, I &s;hall take me to my Subject, and tell you, that from the Town of <HI>Cofana</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kixo,</HI> to the Ea&s;t of the <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and to the North of the line, comes forth the <HI>Coca,</HI> a navigable Ri|ver, which quickly renders him&s;elf on the North-&s;ide into the beginnings of the great River of the <HI>Amazones;</HI> which as yet in the&s;e parts having his &s;tream too rapid and violent, hath not therefore at this place &s;o convenient a navigation him&s;elf, as other Rivers, that enter into his large bed on the &s;ide of the Antarctique or South Pole.

<P>THe third and la&s;t River, which from the North, and from the mountains of the <HI>Cordelier,</HI> comes into the great Ri|ver of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> goes under the name of <HI>The great Caketa;</HI> and is acknowledged and celebrated for the greate&s;t of all the Rivers in <HI>America,</HI> next to the great <HI>Ama|zone.</HI> The Kingdom of new <HI>Granado</HI> glo|ries in its birth, and the Valley of <HI>Nicao</HI> of the Province of <HI>Popayan,</HI> is the famous place of his Source, which hath two de|grees and thirty minutes of North-latitude, and three hundred and three degrees, and fourty minutes of longitude, on the ter|re&s;trial Globe. This great River &s;o much renown'd, and yet &s;o little known to this day by Geographers, receives pre&s;ently a marvellous increa&s;e of waters, which de|&s;cend in great abundance from the great
<PB N="40" REF="38">mountains of S^t <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Bogota;</HI> and taking his way from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, almo&s;t every where parallell to the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> he in&s;en&s;ibly draws near to runne under the line, continuing thus his cour&s;e untill about at one degree of North-latitude, and three hundred eighteen degrees of longitude, he divides his large and magnificent Chan|nell into <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> and <HI>Rio-grand;</HI> i. e. into the Black River and the great River. But the great <HI>Caketa</HI> is &s;o wonderfull at this place, that this divi&s;ion hinders him not to render him&s;elf on the one &s;ide into the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> by the fir&s;t of his branches, and by an entry of more than one league and an half broad; nor to keep for a long time the colour of his own plea&s;ant and deep waters, untill that the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> all gathered up into one great bed, for re|ceiving of him, deface this appearance of the <HI>Caketaes</HI> waters, but not untill after a combate between them, for the &s;pace of twelve leagues length. As for his other branch (which I take to be the great River of the <HI>Orenoc,</HI> contrary to the opinions of Father <HI>D' Acogna,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;ee no other River from the <HI>Cape of the Sailes</HI> to the Cape of the North, that can be attributed

This Lake is in the Countries of <HI>Guanuco,</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Lima,</HI> the riche&s;t and fir&s;t of all the Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> the mo&s;t rich place of all the world.

So this famous River of <HI>Marag|non</HI> coming forth of this fore&s;aid Lake, waters the long and fertile Valley of <HI>Sau&s;&s;a,</HI> and cutting or cro&s;&s;ing the Kings high way beween the Towns of <HI>Guanuco,</HI> and <HI>Gua|mangue,</HI> under Bridges made of cords and wood with a marvellous artifice, he pa&s;&s;es

Its Grounds and Fields are higher than ordinary; and the Habitations of this Province are &s;o fre|quent, that oftentimes for four leagues to|gether, and &s;ometimes for &s;ix, one can &s;ee nothing el&s;e. This people, though Sa|vage, yet wants neither policy, not good conduct of their affairs; all their Hou&s;es are well ordered, and repleni&s;hed with all &s;orts of Vivers, and Commodities. They have many Kills or Furnaces, and make all fort of Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, which they &s;ell and traffique by with other Nations; but all by way of Exchange, as all other <HI>Indi|ans</HI> do. As to that Habitation of this Countrey, which the <HI>Portuguau,</HI> while they went up the great River, <HI>an.</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred thirty eight, called <HI>The Village of Gold,</HI> (whereof we &s;pake al&s;o in the ninth Chapter) it was by occa&s;ion of a pair of Ear-pendants of fine gold, which they took there from a woman: which were &s;o fine, that the gold was found of

<P>THe great Province of <HI>Suane</HI> heretofore mentioned, hath this &s;ingular glory among&s;t all the others, that are honoured by the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> to carry Gold within her bowels. The fa|mous Mountain that nouri&s;heth in his bo|&s;ome &s;o great a trea&s;ure, hath about two degrees of South latitude, and three hun|dred &s;eventeen degrees of longitude. It is two hundred leagues only di&s;tant from the Town of S^t <HI>Thomas,</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in <HI>Orenoc,</HI> and fourty leagues from the <HI>Atlantique</HI> Sea. And the precious Ri|ver of Gold (for &s;o the Natives of the Countrey call it) which waters its foot, draws abundance of this rich Mettall with him, in form of graines of Corn, and lit|tle bigger billetts. It pre&s;ently disburdens its &s;elf into the <HI>Yopura,</HI> another con&s;ider|able River, which likewi&s;e loo&s;eth him&s;elf into the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> on the North-&s;ide, at three degrees of South
<PB N="61" REF="48">latitude, and five hundred eighty four leagues, from the Sources of the great Ri|ver. Whence it follows that the com|merce &s;o advantageous of the great <HI>Ama|zone</HI> with this famous Mountain of <HI>Suane,</HI> is made the more commodious by the Na|vigation of this River of <HI>Yopura,</HI> by going up him into the River of Gold; and that the ages to come will one day make famous the&s;e places with rich Towns and mag|nifique Inhabitants. For the pre&s;ent, a|mong all the Peoples of the&s;e Countries, the <HI>Managues</HI> are tho&s;e, that traffique with this Gold, the weight whereof, and its finene&s;&s;e makes it &s;o perfect, that it is the mo&s;t excellent of all <HI>America.</HI> The <HI>Indi|ans</HI> that buy of it, by exchange of other things for it, make of it little long Plates, which they hang at their No&s;es, and Ears: and this rich Ornament is ordinary and fre|quent in all the&s;e Provinces, according to the report of the Savages. But the Nati|ons (be&s;ides the <HI>Suanes</HI>) that are neare&s;t to the trea&s;ures of this rich Mountain, are the <HI>Aguaynes,</HI> the <HI>Mocunes,</HI> the chief of all &s;uch as dwell to the Ea&s;t of the <HI>Suanes,</HI> and cultivate the fertile Fields, that are watered by both the Channells of the <HI>Araganatube.</HI>

<PB N="63" REF="49">of the <HI>Portuguais</HI> them&s;elves pa&s;&s;ing a|long did perceive it. They are of a good &s;tature, of a fair body, and well formed. They are expert in all things they take them&s;elves to, e&s;pecially in Armes; and go all naked, as well men, as women. They are al&s;o &s;o numerous for multitude, that never any &s;aw at one time &s;o many <HI>Bar|barians</HI> together. It was an infallible token of their great courage, that they went and came (as they did) amid&s;t the Armed Ve&s;|&s;els and Ships of Warre of the <HI>Portuguais,</HI> to traffique with them, with extreme a&s;&s;u|rance of minde. For while&s;t the <HI>Portu|guais</HI> going up the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> &s;ail'd along by this Province, every day there came to them above two hundred <HI>Canoes,</HI> full of Women and Children, with Fruits, Fi&s;hes, Meales, and other &s;uch like Pro|vi&s;ion, which they changed with the <HI>Portu|guais</HI> for <HI>axes</HI> and <HI>knives,</HI> whereof they have great e&s;teem, as all others <HI>Indians</HI> of the new world. The <HI>Yorimans</HI> inhabite not only the main Land of this Province, but fill al&s;o the great Iles that the great <HI>Amazone</HI> makes by &s;undry of his Armes &s;tretched forth.

It was in this place, &s;o abounding with all things, that the Fleet of the <HI>Portuguais</HI> &s;tay'd five or &s;ix daies at its return, after it had gone up the River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> before with good &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e, as &s;hall be afterwards related. Not one of &s;o numerous a people fled from his Hou&s;e for fear of their arrivall; but the whole Fleet got freely from them, all that they &s;tood in need of; and becau&s;e the Na|vy was near an end of all its Provi&s;ions, it got from their bounty five hundred Sacks of the Meale of <HI>Mandioqua,</HI> which &s;ufficed it for the whole re&s;t of its Voyage. The other Habitations al&s;o of this happy Pro|vince of <HI>Yoriman,</HI> are not much inferiour

<P>SEeing the Ile of <HI>Topinambes</HI> is in this place of the River of the <HI>Ama|zones;</HI> and that it is the greate&s;t of all its Iles, the mo&s;t renowned Province of any that it waters; we &s;hall &s;ay fir&s;t, that it is of more than &s;ixty leagues of length; and that it is &s;o &s;ituated in the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> that it comes nearer to his South-&s;ide, than to his North, and that all the di&s;tances and mea&s;ures, that concern it, are in the tenth Chapter of this Book.

Finally, we &s;hall &s;ay, that once it was inhabited by its Natives, and originall <HI>Indians,</HI> but that the <HI>Topinambes</HI> coming upon them, cha&s;ed them from it after &s;undry Battells, and po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of it with &s;o much glory and reputation for them&s;elves, that the terrour of their names
<PB N="77" REF="56">did reach to the neighbouring Nations. Now the&s;e <HI>Topinambes</HI> before had inhabited the South coa&s;ts of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> where not be|ing able to endure the hard entreaty of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> towards them, after that they had come upon them; they renounced their dear Countrey, and voluntarily a|bandoned with great re&s;olution more than eighty of their great Bourgades. So they marched in infinite multitudes of men, wo|men, and children, &s;treight towards the We&s;t, and under the &s;ame parallell. They cro&s;&s;ed by &s;wimming the great Rivers of <HI>Parane,</HI> and of the <HI>Plata,</HI> and leaving on their left hand the Province of <HI>Tucuman,</HI> they in end took up their lodgings on the beginnings of the great River <HI>Made|ra.</HI> But it befalling one of the&s;e <HI>Topi|nambes</HI> &s;ome while after to kill a Cow of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> on the frontier of <HI>Peru,</HI> for which he was rudely cha&s;ti&s;ed; the &s;ame fear that carried them too lightly to leave their ancient abode, made them all to di&s;lodge pre&s;ently from this new one. And to the end to put them&s;elves farre enough from all the Provinces of any neighbourhood with <HI>Peru</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and and to make their Voyage or removall
<PB N="78" REF="57">with le&s;&s;e inconvenience, and the more di|ligence and circum&s;pection, they embar|qued them&s;elves in <HI>Canoes,</HI> which they had ready in great number, and &s;o &s;uffered them&s;elves to go at adventure down the &s;tream of <HI>Madera;</HI> and after &s;undry Moneths navigation, found them&s;elves ar|rived in the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> and &s;o la&s;t|ly on the bankes of this Ile of <HI>Topinambe,</HI> which they po&s;&s;e&s;t by Armes, as hath been &s;aid.

But the Source of this fair and fertile River is unknown to us as yet; and yet its great|ne&s;&s;e makes it appear, and per&s;wades us, that is it very remote on the South-&s;ide, be|tween the coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> and the great Lake of <HI>Xaraya.</HI> About the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred thirty, the Engli&s;h went up his broad channell with one Ship, and coming down his bankes again, &s;tayed there &s;ome time to &s;ow, and gather Tobac|co; but being cha&s;ed from thence with &s;ome lo&s;&s;e by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they went away without returning.

The embarkment for this expe|dition, was on the River of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> the neere&s;t to the Town of <HI>Lima;</HI> the chief of that Province.

The dexterity of the Marriners and Row|ers, and the favourable help of the windes, broke the fir&s;t difficulties, that the Fleet could have had, to gain without lo&s;&s;e and danger the true channell of the great <HI>A|mazone.</HI> But in departing from the coa&s;ts of the Province of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> and of the Countries that are &s;ubject to it, the <HI>Portu|galls</HI> could no longer know neither the bank-&s;ides, nor the right wayes and cour&s;es of the great River, becau&s;e of &s;o many crooked Armes of his, that he ca&s;tes out, and thereby frames his many I&s;lands. So that the Navigation becoming longer, by following waies uncertain, and not before known; and the troubles and toyles in&s;epa|rable from a Sea-Army, that mu&s;t often di&s;embark, to camp on the firm Land, be|gan to weary the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to di&s;ta&s;te them from further pur&s;uing of the Voy|age.

And tho&s;e goodly and great women, which pre&s;ented them&s;elves armed on the head of the <HI>Americans,</HI> upon the Bank of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> near to <HI>Coru|ris</HI> (as we have related before) gave much credit to the fir&s;t opinion of the&s;e <HI>A|mazones</HI> of the new-world. This is not yet enough for us to per&s;wade our &s;elves of the truth of the&s;e valiant and warlick La|dies: the royall audience al&s;o of <HI>Kito,</HI> hath &s;ometimes received con&s;iderable informati|ons of it. That audience a long time ap|plyed its cares to have &s;ound out the know|ledge of the&s;e <HI>Amazones;</HI> and the depo&s;i|tions that to them were made thereof at &s;undry times, agree all in this point: That in the va&s;t fields of this <HI>America,</HI> there was one Region peopled with <HI>warriore&s;&s;e women,</HI> which living and maintaining them&s;elves without men, had no communication with them, but on &s;ome certain dayes of the year, to have by them children, or daugh|ters like unto them&s;elves. And in the Town of <HI>Pa&s;to</HI> &s;ubject to the &s;ame audience, an <HI>Indian</HI> woman gave a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he her &s;elf had been in their Countrey; and by her other Relations agreed with the prece|dent
<PB N="132" REF="84">circum&s;tances. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular te&s;timonies of it, that have been given to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Portugalls,</HI> was 1639 in de&s;cending the great River, and in the great habitation of the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> and Ea&s;t-point of their famous I&s;le. This Nation as gene|rous as valiant, was never wearied with reci|ting the wonders of the&s;e <HI>Amazones.</HI> They &s;poke of their policy, and of their valour, much like what the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Latines</HI> have &s;ung of the policy and valour of the <HI>A|mazones</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And not to &s;tay longer on this di&s;cour&s;e, be it true, or be it fabu|lous, I will conclude it with this renowned name of the <HI>Comapoyares,</HI> under which the <HI>Amazones</HI> of <HI>America</HI> are every where known only.</P>

In which neither doth the heat ever choak; nor the cold ever &s;eaze it; the Air is alwayes alike, becau&s;e its Winter (as in the re&s;t of <HI>America</HI>) proceeds of no other occa&s;ion, but from inundations, which hinder the productions of the earth, or retard them for &s;ome Moneths: and not from any rece&s;&s;e or withdrawing of the Sun, which every day there ri&s;eth, and &s;etteth at the &s;ame hour. What marvels &s;hould not one be per&s;waded of, from an heaven &s;o benign and favourable?

<P>A fir&s;t Adverti&s;ement to Geographers, upon the Longitudes of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>FOra&s;much as the knowledge of the Lon|gitudes of the Globe of the Earth, is as important, as nece&s;&s;ary, in the Theory, and practice of Geography, of the Sphere, of A&s;tronomy, of Navigation, of A&s;trology; it mu&s;t not be thought &s;trange, if &s;o many excellent per&s;ons, and knowing men have ever bended them&s;elves to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e the mo&s;t perfectly; or, to &s;ay better, the lea&s;t imperfectly, that was po&s;&s;ible to them. But as the difficulties of it have never been well overcome, at lea&s;t to the U&s;e and Ap|plication; &s;o I cannot now con&s;ent to the la&s;t Cart, and recente&s;t Topography of South-<HI>America,</HI> touching this Longitude: in which Cart there is but fifty eight degrees, and twenty minutes of difference between <HI>Port Vieux</HI> (or old) and <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tine,</HI> where South-<HI>America</HI> is broade&s;t, and longe&s;t. For as before, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made its breadth but of fifty one degrees, and the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> of fifty five, (both the one, and the other being moved thereto by rea&s;ons of State and policy, becau&s;e of the
<PB N="141" REF="88">debate about the <HI>Moluccoes</HI>) and after them, the moderner ob&s;ervers of this dif|ference of Longitudes, extend it to fifty eight, as we have &s;aid: &s;o this change could not have been made, but by ob&s;ervation of Eclip&s;es made under divers Meridians. Whence it follows al&s;o, that this new Lon|gitude of the We&s;t-coa&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> is not yet exact enough, becau&s;e of the diffe|rences, that are ordinarily found in &s;uch a|&s;tronomicall Ob&s;ervations; whether through the fault and littlene&s;s of the in&s;truments, or the negligence of the Ob&s;ervers, who &s;eek the hours and minutes of them, by A|&s;trolabes, and not by the way of Sphericall Triangles: to &s;ay nothing of the difficulties about Parallaxes in the Eclip&s;es of the Sun, and of the Phenombres in the Eclip&s;e of the Moon, which hinder the taking exactly of the time of her immer&s;ion, and emer&s;ion, under and out of the &s;hadow of the Earth.</P>
<P>But to let it be &s;een, that I am not the only man, that take to my &s;elf this licence, to &s;u&s;pect and give little tru&s;t to the exact|ne&s;s of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, &s;o as thereby definitively to regulate Longitudes, with neglect of itinerary di&s;tances, which (being well managed) often &s;upply in &s;ome &s;ort
<PB N="142" REF="89">the others too great incertitude: I &s;hall here &s;et down the examples, which <HI>John Kepler;</HI> that famous A&s;tronomer, thought good him&s;elf to &s;et down at the end of the Cata|logue of the Towns, of the <HI>Rodolphine</HI> Ta|bles, that he might &s;how the varieties of the difference of Longitudes, found out by di|ver&s;e Ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame Eclip&s;es, between the Meridians of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>No|rimberg,</HI> as followeth. <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> makes it of thirty &s;ix minutes of an hour, or of nine degrees of the equator; and with him, many more. <HI>Stafler,</HI> and <HI>Verner</HI> of eighteen minutes of an hour, or of font de|grees, and an half. <HI>Shoner, Mercator,</HI> and <HI>Hondius,</HI> regulate it to twelve minutes of an hour, or to three degrees. And leaving others, <HI>Kepler</HI> him&s;elf hath reduced it to four minutes of an hour, or to one degree only. So that the varieties of the difference of the&s;e two Meridians, in &s;o little a di&s;tance, as they &s;tand in, coming to eight whole de|grees; with how much more rea&s;on may we doubt of the true Longitude of the We&s;t-coa&s;ts of the South and North-<HI>A|merica?</HI> Now the&s;e diver&s;ities are no le&s;s frequent every where el&s;e, as may be veri|fied by the difference of the Meridians of the
<PB N="143" REF="89">&s;ame <HI>Rome,</HI> and of <HI>Toledo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;et down in Authors of A&s;tronomy, and Geo|graphy. For <HI>Kepler</HI> the la&s;t and painfulle&s;t of all, reduces it to &s;ixteen degrees; and according to others, it amounts often to thirty. Which notwith&s;tanding we have made an e&s;&s;ay to remedy (as much as the matter doth permit) in our Geographicall Tables, by more exact cares and re&s;earches, than tho&s;e of this curious Author <HI>Kepler</HI> him&s;elf; which being not yet Printed, yet <HI>Mon&s;ieur Morin</HI> the Kings profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks, hath not thought ill to draw out of them, that which he hath &s;et at the beginning of his Abridgement of the <HI>Rodol|phine</HI> Tables, as preferable to any other Catalogue of Towns, that he could then meet with to &s;erve his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Rea&s;ons brought, I would now willingly con&s;ent, that the Longitude of the We&s;t-coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> were made &s;horter by ten degrees at lea&s;t, that the dif|ference of the Longitudes of the Town of <HI>Kito,</HI> and of the Point of <HI>Zaparara</HI> were made of fourty &s;even degrees, and &s;o the di|&s;tance from the one to the other, in a &s;traight Line, of nine hundred fourty Geometricall Leagues. And this would agree better,
<PB N="144" REF="90">and not be &s;o far different from the total number of mea&s;ures ob&s;erved in the naviga|tion of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> as is to be &s;een in the eighth Chapter of this Book; through all which (that we might change nothing, out of our own opinion) we have &s;et down the Longitudes, according to the ordinary and recente&s;t Carts of South-<HI>America.</HI> But &s;urely it ought to be made broader by Geographers, that &s;hall go over it again, to find place there for all that we faithfully relate unto them in this work, that &s;o the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> and &s;o many other Rivers, that run unto him, and Provinces, that are di&s;covered upon them, may com|modiou&s;ly be lodged, and in their own na|turall extent. In which ca&s;e the Ea&s;t-coa&s;t of this &s;ame <HI>America</HI> to the turn of the <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> &s;hould be kept in the &s;ame degrees and minutes of its longitude; and all the re&s;t from thence towards the We&s;t, aug|mented unto ten degrees, and compa&s;&s;ed in the ju&s;t and fitting Geometricall proporti|ons, as well in regard to Meridians, as to the Longitudes. And the &s;ame ampliation being made over North-<HI>America,</HI> you will find his Ea&s;t-coa&s;t drawn back by four or five degrees, conformably to the a&s;&s;urances
<PB N="145" REF="90">that the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gave, that &s;ail'd to <HI>Virginia;</HI> and to the report of <HI>John Laet</HI> in his third Book of <HI>America.</HI> Whereunto I offer my &s;elf willingly to contribute my cares and &s;tudies, in favours of &s;uch, as will undertake it; making u&s;e, and &s;erving my &s;elf, in all the&s;e Geographicall procedures, with the precepts of the true, and new do|ctrine of the eighth Book of my <HI>Geometricall Theorems,</HI> Printed 1654, as well for the Longitudes, as itenerary di&s;tances: which I there &s;hew, that they ought alwayes to be in great Circles, and not in parallells, redu|ced to certain proportions.

<P>BUt to get a perfecter knowledge as well of the Longitudes, that fit <HI>America,</HI> as tho&s;e that concern the Ea&s;t-<HI>Indies;</HI> we have re&s;olved to &s;et down here a method to find them ea&s;ily by the motion of the Moon, upon firm land, in this manner. 1. Draw on a right horizontall Plain, that is very &s;mooth and white, a very exact meridian Line: and with the &s;ame exactne&s;s ob&s;erve the height of the Pole, by a quadrant that can mark minutes, and if po&s;&s;ible, half mi|nutes; as it is ea&s;ie now to get &s;uch an one, by the new inventions of dividing the Alhi|dades of it. 2. On the night of the full Moon, take the horizontall height of a fixt Star, untill the &s;hadow of a Plummet hung, made by the Moon, &s;hall be ju&s;t upon the Meridian; but with this caution, that the height of the Star ob&s;erved, be at lea&s;t of thirty degrees, to avoid refractions; and that the &s;ame Stars di&s;tance from the Meri|dian be rea&s;onable enough for a greater ex|actne&s;s. 3. Seek the true di&s;tance of the fore&s;aid Star from the Meridian of your
<PB N="147" REF="91">Hemi&s;phere by this Rule. As the Rect|angle contained in the Sinu&s;es of the com|plement of the elevation of the Pole, and of the complement of the declination of the Star, is to the quadrat-&s;ide of the whole Sinu&s;e; &s;o the Rectangle contained in the Sinu&s;es of the &s;umme or totall, and of the difference of the half of the complement of the ob&s;erved height of the Star; and of the half of the difference of the complement of the declination of the Star, and of the com|plement of the elevation of the Pole, is un|to the quadrat-&s;ide of the Sinu&s;e of the half of the true di&s;tance of the Star from the Me|ridian. But if the declination and right a&s;|cen&s;ion of the Star, which you make u&s;e of for this a&s;tronomicall Ob&s;ervation, be not &s;et down to your hand, in the &s;ame Table of its longitudes and latitudes; you &s;hall find it by the Rules of my &s;ixth Book of Geome|tricall Theorems afore&s;aid, whither I refer you. 4. Double the foregoing half of the di&s;tance found, and &s;ub&s;tract that from the right a&s;cen&s;ion of the Star ob&s;erved, if it be in the Ea&s;tern part of the heavens; but adde it to its right a&s;cen&s;ion, if the Star be in the We&s;t part of the heavens: and the &s;umme of the addition, or the re&s;idue after
<PB N="148" REF="92">the &s;ub&s;traction, will be the true right a&s;|cen&s;ion of the Meridian of the Moon, in de|grees, minutes, and &s;econds of the equator. 5. In the Ephemerids, or in the A&s;trono|micall Tables, take the Node of the Moon a&s;cendant, or de&s;cendant, in &s;igns, degrees, minutes, and &s;econds of the Ecliptick ac|cording to the hour of your ob&s;ervation af|ter your be&s;t e&s;teem: to wit, that which is neare&s;t to that right a&s;cen&s;ion of the Moon, or of the mid&s;t of heaven, which is all one. But in the Rule of the precedent Article, if the Pole be North, the declination al&s;o of the fixed Star mu&s;t be Northern; and contrarily. 6. With the &s;ame right a&s;cen|&s;ion of the Moon and of the Meridian, take al&s;o in the &s;ame Tables, (or by the &s;ixth Book of my Theorems) the mid&s;t of hea|ven, in &s;igns, degrees, minutes, and &s;econds in the Ecliptick; and the Angle of the Me|ridian and of the Ecliptick only in degrees, minutes, and &s;econds; which we &s;hall al|wayes hereafter call <HI>the mid&s;t of heaven,</HI> to &s;hun a longer title, or repetition. 7. Sub|&s;tract from the <HI>midst of heaven,</HI> the Node of the Moon; or from the Node of the Moon, the mid&s;t of heaven, that you may finde alwayes le&s;&s;e re&s;idue than ninety de|grees:
<PB N="149" REF="92">and this di&s;tance of the Node of the Moon from the mid&s;t of heaven, will be the ba&s;e of a Sphericall Triangle-Obliquangle, whereof the le&s;&s;er Angle will alwayes be of five degrees, and no minutes; and the greater Angle alwayes the Angle of the Me|ridian, and of the Ecliptick of the foregoing Article, according to the &s;eventh Book of my Theorems. 8. Seek the Arch of the Meridian contained between the Orbite of the Moon and the Ecliptick Circle, by this Rule. As the totall <HI>Sinu&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Sine,</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the di&s;tance of the Node of the Moon in the mid&s;t of heaven; &s;o is the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the perpendicular. And as the totall <HI>Sine,</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the complement of the preceding di&s;tance; &s;o is the <HI>tangent</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <HI>tangent</HI> of the complement of the Angle &s;ought for. 9. Take the difference of this Angle &s;ought for, and of the Angle of the mid&s;t of hea|ven, and you &s;hall have the &s;econd Angle &s;ought for, in degrees, minutes, and &s;econds. Then as the total <HI>Sine</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the complement of the &s;econd Angle required; &s;o the <HI>tangent</HI> of the complement of the pre|cedent perpendicular, is to the <HI>tangent</HI> of
<PB N="150" REF="93">the complement of the Arch of the Meridi|an, contained between the mid&s;t of heaven, and the center of the Moon. 10. Finally, as the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the precedent Arch of the Me|ridian; &s;o the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of the mid&s;t of heaven, is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the argument of the latitude of the Moon: which argument, you mu&s;t &s;ub&s;tract or adde to the Node of the Moon, according to the di&s;po&s;all of the probleme, for getting in &s;igns, degrees, mi|nutes, and &s;econds, the place of the Moon in her Orbite, 11. With the precedent argument of the latitude of the Moon, take in the a&s;tronomick Tables its reduction to the Ecliptick in minutes and &s;econds, that you may either &s;ub&s;tract, or adde the &s;ame (according to the title of the &s;ame Tables) to the place of the Moon in her Orbite; and you &s;hall have the true longitude, or the true place of the Moon in the Ecliptick, in &s;igns, degrees, minutes, and &s;econds. As al&s;o in the &s;ame Tables, her true latitude, (if you de&s;ire it) with the &s;ame argument; &s;eeing in all the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the Moon is alwayes near her copulations. 12. Com|pare the two longitudes of the Moon, found out in this manner, on the &s;ame night, but
<PB N="151" REF="93">in diver&s;e Meridians, and take the diffe|rence of them: as al&s;o her hourly motion, at the time of both the ob&s;ervations, be|cau&s;e the hours, minutes, and &s;econds of hours, that &s;hall agree to the degrees, mi|nutes and &s;econds of the Ecliptick of that difference, being turned into degrees and minutes of the Equator, will give the true difference of the Longitudes contained be|tween the two Towns, where the two ob|&s;ervations have been made.</P>
<P>Now all the &s;ecret of this ea&s;ie and new method, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the center of the body of the Moon is nece&s;&s;arily in the Circle of the Meridian, when &s;he is full, or very near her oppo&s;ition, the &s;hadow of the Plummet-Line, coming ju&s;t upon the true Meridian-Line of the place, where the ob|&s;ervation is made: and in this; that nothing more being required to be added, but the plain heighth of one fixt Star, and without Parallax, the operation may be made in any Moneth of the year, without &s;taying for a tedious re&s;titution of A&s;tronomy, and with|out being put to the charges of great In&s;tru|ments Horizontall and Verticall, which are otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the practice of this Science of finding out longitudes, which
<PB N="152" REF="94"><HI>Nonius, Horoncius, Fri&s;ius, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Morinus</HI> the perfectlye&s;t of them all, have painfully travelled in. But this is enough for the Geographers, and Mathematicians, that are di&s;per&s;ed over the world, and ought to labour in the re&s;titution of Geography: to whom notwith&s;tanding I could wi&s;h an ex|acter knowledge of A&s;tronomy, and of Trigonometry, that they might the more ea&s;ily arrive at the glory of perfecting this goodly &s;cience, no le&s;s plea&s;ant, than ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And for conclu&s;ion, we &s;hall in favours of an A&s;tronomer, that will make this ob|&s;ervation of the Moon in his own particular, that he may compare it, with that of the Rodolphine Tables; tell him, that the lon|gitude of the Town of <HI>Rome</HI> on the globe of the earth, is fourty degrees; and that its Meridian is the &s;ame, that it hath in the Ro|dolphine Tables, which are the be&s;t of all other a&s;tronomick ones, if you correct but the equations of the Center, and the inter|valls of the Planets, by the fifth Book of our Geometricall Theorems. As al&s;o for the choice of the equation of the time, if you u&s;e that equation, which proceeds from the difference of the two right a&s;cen&s;ions, to
<PB N="153" REF="94">wit, of the <HI>middle place,</HI> and of the <HI>true place</HI> of the Sun, in the Ecliptick; becau&s;e that among&s;t &s;o many divers and various e|quations of the time, that the mo&s;t excellent Authors have yet given, or e&s;tabli&s;hed, that alone &s;eems to me Geometricall and ex|act; as we have &s;aid el&s;ewhere; and that the errours of other wayes will amount &s;ometimes to four of five degrees, in longi|tudes upon the earth. But as the foundati|on of that doctrine depends on the equall motion of the Sun in the Ecliptick, and not at all in the equator, the opinion that we have of it, is more from the appearances of truth, than from any de&s;ign we have to contradict.</P>
