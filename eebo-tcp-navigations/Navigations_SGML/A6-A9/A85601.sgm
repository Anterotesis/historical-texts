<P>_THe Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> with 20 Sayle of &s;hips, lies floting up and downe the Britti&s;h Coa&s;t; in&s;omuch that no &s;hips can pa&s;&s;e nor e&s;cape his fury; For, on Tue&s;day la&s;t a Fleet of Marchants &s;ayling towards the Lands-End, were &s;et upon by the <HI>Hoptonians,</HI> who coming within &s;hot of them gave them a broad &s;ide;
<PB N="2" REF="3">but were an&s;wered with the like volley from them a|gain; in&s;omuch, that they came to a hot di&s;pute, the fight continuing many hours, and after the exchange of &s;everall tokens from the Sons of <HI>Mars,</HI> the L. <HI>Hopton</HI> held off, refu&s;ing to fight any longer, and &s;teered to|wards the I&s;le of <HI>Scilley;</HI> the famous &s;hip called the <HI>Cul|pepper,</HI> &amp; about 6 more cha&s;ed them about 2 leagues, &s;unk three of them, the re&s;t e&s;caped: in this fight many were &s;lain and wounded on both &s;ides, and one of the Marchants &s;hips &s;unk al&s;o, above 100 Mariners &s;acrifi|cing their lives in this engagement. The fight being en|ded, the Marchants Fleet hoy&s;ted &s;ayl, &amp; &s;teerd toward the Lands-End; which being done, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> put to Sea again, and (being thir&s;ty of revenge) after few hours &s;ayl, he e&s;pyed a prey, who with fury and rage made towards them, gave them a broad &s;ide, &s;urroun|ded them (although 8 in number) in&s;omuch that three of them were clo&s;e be&s;et, and &s;everall times ready to board; but by their undanted courage and gallantry repul&s;ed them, di&s;puted the On&s;et, and were in a good way to have got &s;afe from them, but a &s;upply of more &s;hipping coming afterwards from <HI>Scilley,</HI> joyned with the fir&s;t Squadron, who by their great potency and &s;trength overpowred them boarded the &s;hips, &s;eized on all the goods and marchandize, tying every man back to back, &s;hutting them under Decks, and carryed them pri&s;oners to the I&s;le of Scilley, where they now remain under the barbarous re&s;traint of Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> the Governour; <HI>God in his due time re&s;tore them to liberty, and grant them patiense, in this their time of affliction.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;peedy and timely &s;upplies of &s;hipping be not ha&s;t|ned forth, it is to be feared, they will become &s;ole ma|&s;ters
<PB N="3" REF="3">of the Britti&s;h Seas. Since their taking of the late prize, they have met with another <HI>Bristoll</HI> &s;hip, richly laden with cloth, which the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> hath di&s;tri|buted among&s;t the &s;ea-men and &s;ouldiers. He is now &s;ayled towards <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, but by the way, hee &s;truck in at a Creek neer <HI>Pendennis,</HI> where he landed many of his men for the fetching in of provi&s;ion, and other accommodation; but before they could facili|ate and accompli&s;h their De&s;ign, the <HI>Parliaments</HI> For|ces at <HI>Pendennis</HI> having notice thereof, a con&s;iderable party of Hor&s;e and Foot were forthwith commanded out, who ha&s;tned to welcome their coming in, and en|deavoured to get between them and the water, for the intercepting of their pa&s;&s;age; but through the maligni|ty of the Corni&s;h-men their de&s;ign was almo&s;t fru|&s;trated; for after few hours march they were di&s;co|vered, and the Enemy in a po&s;ture to receive them, who upon their neer approach &s;aluted each other with the tokens of <HI>Mars,</HI> and after a hot conflict the <HI>Hoptoni|ans</HI> retreated within command of their Ships, our men pur&s;ued, kiled 19. wounded many, and made good their retreat with the lo&s;&s;e of 7 men. Their Ordnance did much retard our pur&s;uit, by which meanes mo&s;t of them got &s;afe aboard having many Boats in readi|ne&s;&s;e to receive them; otherwi&s;e few of them had e|&s;caped: &s;ome of the Land &s;ouldiers de&s;erted them at their coming a&s;hore, who &s;ay, That the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> is commander in chief of that Squadron, and of all the Land forces thereunto belonging, and that his Colours (or En&s;igns) are yelow, with black bulers in the mid&s;t, and on the top thereof, this Motto written in Chara|cters of Gold, <HI>For Charles the &s;econd.</HI></P>
