<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AMerica</HI> was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by <HI>Chri&s;topher
Columbus</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> in the year 1492,
in the Name of <HI>Ferdinando</HI> King of
<HI>Arragon,</HI> but takes its Name from <HI>Ame|ricus
Ve&s;pucius</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> who di&s;cover'd the
Country of <HI>Brezil</HI> five years after, by order of
<HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Europeans</HI> had no &s;ooner enter'd on this
va&s;t Continent, and the I&s;lands about it, but the Na|tives
&s;hew'd 'em all imaginable Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect,
and were ready to wor&s;hip 'em as Gods; but the&s;e &s;oon
took care to convince 'em of their Error, and to de|liver
'em from the danger of falling into this &s;ort of
Idolatry, by treating 'em with all manner of Cruel|ties,
and tormenting 'em like &s;o many Devils: &s;o
that the&s;e barbarous People receiv'd as great a
turn in their thoughts concerning the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as
the Barbarians of the I&s;land of <HI>Melita</HI> did in re&s;pect
of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> for as the&s;e believ'd him to be a God
whom they had ju&s;t before taken for a Murderer, &s;o
the other really found them to be Murderers, whom
they had a little before e&s;teem'd as &s;o many Gods.</P>
<P>The following Relation of the De&s;truction of ma|ny
Millions of <HI>Indians</HI> by all the inhuman methods
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could invent, would appear incredible,
were not the truth of it confe&s;s'd, and atte&s;ted by
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves, and among others, e&s;pe|cially
by <HI>Don Bartholomew de las Ca&s;as</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Chiapa,</HI> who made large Complaints of the&s;e Cru|elties
<PB REF="4">
to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the Royal Coun|cil
for the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a de&s;ign to put a &s;top to 'em
if po&s;&s;ible. That he is a Per&s;on of irreproachable
Credit in this ca&s;e, will appear by the following ac|count,
wherein he challenges all the World to di&s;|prove
the truth of the matters of Fact he a&s;&s;erts,
while he &s;tood the Te&s;t of a Court who could ea&s;ily
have detected him, if he had attempted to impo&s;e on
'em by a malicious Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop writes with &s;uch an Air of Hone&s;ty,
Sincerity, and Charity, as would very well have be|come
one of a better Religion than that in which he
had the unhappine&s;s to be educated. It may well &s;ur|prize
the Reader to hear a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prelat declaim
&s;o loudly again&s;t Per&s;ecution, and plead &s;o freely for
Liberty of Con&s;cience in a Country &s;ubjugated to
the Inqui&s;ition. To hear him in his di&s;pute again&s;t
Doctor <HI>Sepulueda,</HI> decry all methods of Violence for
the propagation of the Truth, as more &s;utable to
the Maxims of Mahometi&s;m than the Principles of
Chri&s;tianity: To hear him a&s;&s;ert the Natural Right
of all Mankind to Liberty and Property, and inveigh
again&s;t all V&s;urpation and Tyranny in the &s;marte&s;t
Terms, is enough to move any one's Wonder, and Pity
too, when on the other hand 'tis ob&s;erv'd how much
he magnifies the Power and Authority of the Pope in
&s;ome of his Propo&s;itions contain'd in the following
Treati&s;e. But all may &s;erve to convince one how great
an advantage or di&s;advantage a Man has as he
pleads the Cau&s;e of Truth or Error; and of the
great difference there is between the genuin Lan|guage
of Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, and the &s;ervil
Prejudices of Bigotry and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
'Tis no le&s;s a Subject of Admiration that a Book
of this &s;tamp, which reflects &s;o &s;harply on Per&s;ecution
and Tyranny, &s;hould &s;ee the light <HI>cum privilegio</HI> at
this time of day in <HI>France,</HI> where the Civil and Re|ligious
Liberty of Subjects have not been provided
for with the utmo&s;t Care, where the Will of the
Prince has long &s;ince been the Law, and Dragoons
of late years the principal Mi&s;&s;ionaries for the Pro|pagation
of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>This Treati&s;e was fir&s;t compos'd in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in the
beginning of the Reign of <HI>Charles V.</HI> and was
long &s;ince tran&s;lated and printed in more Lan|guages
than one; but having lately receiv'd a new
dre&s;s in Modern French at <HI>Paris,</HI> 'tis hop'd this
Tran&s;lation from the <HI>French</HI> will not be unaccepta|ble
to the Engli&s;h Nation. I'm &s;ure the above|mention'd
Principles of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> con|cerning
Property and Liberty both Civil and Reli|gious,
are more agreeable to the Genius and Con&s;ti|tution
of this I&s;land, than to the pre&s;ent temper of
that part of the Continent which lies neare&s;t to it;
and &s;o this Book may expect at lea&s;t as favorable a
reception in this Nation as in that where it has
been lately publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>What the Bi&s;hop &s;ays here and there in favor of
his own Religion, is &s;o weak, and has been &s;o often
exploded here and every where el&s;e where the Refor|mation
has obtain'd, that 'twould be unnece&s;&s;ary to
confute any of tho&s;e Popi&s;h Fancies in this Preface.
'Tis enough for me that I have faithfully di&s;charg'd
the part of a Tran&s;lator. And if &s;ome particular
things occur more than once, it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd on
the one hand, that the Bi&s;hop had need to mention
<PB REF="5">
them on divers occa&s;ions, as when he di&s;puted, and
when he wrote his Arguments for the u&s;e of the
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &amp;c. and on the other, that the Im|portance
of the Affair, and the Greatne&s;s of his
Zeal to have the Grievances he complain'd of re|dre&s;s'd,
made &s;o deep an Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome things on
his Mind that he could not forbear to repeat 'em.</P>
<P>As for the Tran&s;lation it &s;elf, I hope tho&s;e that
&s;hall have the Curio&s;ity to compare it with the French
Copy, will find that I have done it Ju&s;tice. And
if there is not that exactne&s;s of Method and Stile
the pre&s;ent Age expects, it may be the better ex|cus'd,
when 'tis con&s;ider'd how long &s;ince the Original
was compos'd. However, the extraordinary things
contain'd in this Hi&s;tory will make &s;ufficient amends
for any Defects in the Compo&s;ition of the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Chiapa,</HI> and for the abrupt Tran&s;itions &s;ometimes
us'd by the Compiler of this Treati&s;e in putting the
Bi&s;hop's &s;everal Pieces together, of which it almo&s;t
wholly con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, That as no Hi&s;tory in the World
can parallel this for the inhuman &s;laughter of &s;uch
va&s;t numbers of People; &s;o the&s;e Barbarities, to|gether
with the bloody Croi&s;ades in the 12<HI>th</HI> and
13<HI>th</HI> Centuries, as well as the many Per&s;ecutions
and Ma&s;&s;acres &s;ince the Reformation, render it no
difficult matter to di&s;cern to what Church that Pro|phetick
Character agrees, that <HI>in her was found</HI>
not only <HI>the Blood of Prophets and of Saints,</HI> but
<HI>of all that were &s;lain upon the Earth.</HI> Rev.

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF THE
VOYAGES and CRUELTIES
Of the SPANIARDS in the
WEST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THE <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were di&s;cover'd in the
Year 1492; the year after the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;etled there, and inhabited this new
World. But for the &s;pace of the&s;e 49
years la&s;t pa&s;t, an infinite number of People have
left <HI>Spain</HI> to dwell in the&s;e Countries: they generally
touch at <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> which is a very fertile and large
I&s;land, and is become very famous: The Extent of
it is above 600 Leagues; 'tis &s;urrounded with a mul|titude
of &s;mall I&s;lands, and abounds &s;o with Inhabi|tants,
that there's no Country in the World more po|pulous.
The Continent, which is above 250 Leagues
di&s;tant from it, is of a va&s;t Extent; a great part of
which has been already di&s;covered, and fre&s;h Di&s;|coveries
are made every day: and &s;uch great num|bers
of People inhabit all the&s;e Countries, that it
&s;eems as if Providence had ama&s;s'd together the
greate&s;t part of Mankind in this part of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">
All the&s;e People are naturally &s;imple, they know
not what belongs to Policy and Addre&s;s, to Trick and
Artifice; but are very obedient and faithful to their
rightful Governors: They are Humble, Patient,
and Submi&s;&s;ive, even to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have &s;ub|dued
and en&s;lav'd 'em: they love to live quietly, and
are enemies to di&s;putes and quarrels, hardly know|ing
what 'tis to be malicious, and &s;eldom meditating
Revenge.</P>
<P>They are a weak effeminate People, not capable
of enduring great Fatigues; they care not to be ex|pos'd
to Toil and Labour, and their Life is of no long
continuance; their Con&s;titution is &s;o nice, that a
&s;mall fit of Sickne&s;s carries 'em off. The Children
of their Princes and Nobility, are in all re&s;pects
dealt with like tho&s;e of the meane&s;t Subjects: in
which they differ much from our <HI>Europeans,</HI> among
whom the Children of Kings and great Men, are
brought up with all the delicacy and tenderne&s;s ima|ginable.</P>
<P>The People of this I&s;land are &s;o very poor, that
they live in the want of almo&s;t every thing; they
are very cool and indifferent in the pur&s;uit of tem|poral
Advantages, and &s;eem not to be inclin'd to
Pride and Ambition; their way of living is &s;o fru|gal,
that the antient Hermites in the Wilderne&s;s
were &s;carce more Sober and Ab&s;temious. All the In|dians
in general go naked, only they have the mo|de&s;ty
to wear a &s;ort of Apron about their Wa&s;te.
They &s;ometimes u&s;e a kind of &s;haggy Covering, or
a piece of Cloth an Ell or two long: Tho&s;e of the
be&s;t Fa&s;hion lie on Beds made with Girts tyed in
Knots at the four Corners: their Apprehen&s;ion is
quick and &s;ubtile, therefore they are very docile,
capable of receiving the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ound Do|ctrine,
and ea&s;ily inclin'd to embrace the Principles
of the Catholick Religion: They are no Enemies to
<PB N="3" REF="10">
good Manners, but have a greater di&s;po&s;ition to Ci|vility
than many other Nations, becau&s;e their man|ner
of Life is free from that care and di&s;traction in
which the perplexity of Bu&s;ine&s;s involves others.
The very fir&s;t Ideas and In&s;tructions that are given
'em of our Religion, kindle in their Souls &s;o great a
de&s;ire to the Sacraments and Divine Service of our
Church, that tho&s;e Monks that in&s;truct 'em, have
need of a great deal of Patience to moderate the im|petuo&s;ity
of their Minds, and to an&s;wer all the Que|&s;tions
they have the curio&s;ity to ask. And it may
truly be &s;aid that the&s;e Indian Nations would be the
mo&s;t happy in the World, if endued with the know|ledg
of the true God. The Spaniards them&s;elves
who have treated 'em &s;o ill, cannot but confe&s;s the
goodne&s;s of their natural Temper, and the great
di&s;po&s;ition of their minds to every kind of Vertue.</P>
<P>The Almighty &s;eems to have in&s;pir'd the&s;e People
with a meekne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s of Humour like that of
Lambs: and the Spaniards who have given 'em &s;o
much Trouble, and fallen upon 'em &s;o fiercely, re|&s;emble
&s;avage Tigers, Wolves, and Lions, when in|rag'd
with pre&s;&s;ing Hunger. They applied them|&s;elves
forty years together wholly to the ma&s;&s;acring
the poor Wretches that inhabited the I&s;lands;
putting them to all kinds of unheard of Torments
and Puni&s;hments, (a part of which Cruelties exer|ci&s;ed
on the&s;e mi&s;erable <HI>Indians</HI> we de&s;ign to de&s;cribe
in the &s;equel of this Work) in&s;omuch that this I&s;land
which before the arrival of the Europeans, contain|ed
about three Millions of People, is now reduc'd to
le&s;s than three hundred. The I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> the
length of which is equal to the di&s;tance between
<HI>Validolid</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> is entirely de&s;ert and de&s;titute
of its Inhabitants, and nothing but Ruins now to be
&s;een in it. The I&s;lands of St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
have met with the like Treatment, which were

very fertile and populous, but are render'd de&s;olate
and wa&s;te by the like means. The I&s;lands near <HI>Cu|ba</HI>
and <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> on the North-&s;ide are &s;ixty in
number, which are commonly call'd the I&s;les of Gi|ants,
of which the lea&s;t fruitful abounds more with
Plenty than the Royal Garden of <HI>Seville;</HI> but they
are de&s;titute of Inhabitants, tho 'tis as whole&s;om
an Air as men can breath in. When the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
fir&s;t landed in the&s;e I&s;les, there were above five
hundred thou&s;and Souls; they cut the Throats of a
great part of the&s;e, and carried away the re&s;t by
force to make 'em work in the Mines of <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI>
When &s;ome pious Per&s;ons embarked to vi&s;it the&s;e
I&s;les after the Ravage the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made in 'em,
they found but eleven People left there: It was from
the motives of Charity and Compa&s;&s;ion they under|took
this difficult and perilous Voyage, in hope to
in&s;truct the&s;e poor Creatures in the knowledg of Je|&s;us
Chri&s;t. Above 30 I&s;les near that of St. <HI>John</HI> were
entirely depopulated, tho of a va&s;t Extent, &s;o that
there is &s;carce an Inhabitant to be found in them.</P>
<P>As for the Continent 'tis certain, and what I my
&s;elf know to be true, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have ruined
ten Kingdoms there, bigger than all <HI>Spain,</HI> by the
commi&s;&s;ion of all &s;orts of Barbarity and unheard of
Cruelties. They have driven away or kill'd all the
Inhabitants; &s;o that all the&s;e Kingdoms are de&s;olate
to this day, and reduc'd to a mo&s;t deplorable Con|dition,
tho this was formerly the be&s;t peopled
Country in the World. We dare a&s;&s;ert, without
fear of incurring the reproach of exaggerating, that
in the &s;pace of tho&s;e forty years in which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
exercis'd their intolerable Tyranny in this new
World, they unju&s;tly put to death above twelve
Millions of People, counting Men, Women, and
Children: and it may be affirm'd without injury to
Truth, upon a ju&s;t Calculation, that during this
<PB N="5" REF="11">
&s;pace of Time, above fifty Millions have died in
the&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> who invaded the&s;e I&s;les, and boa&s;ted
of their Chri&s;tianity, made u&s;e of two ways prin|cipally
to exterminate the Inhabitants: the fir&s;t of
which was by an unju&s;t and bloody War carried on
with the utmo&s;t Barbarity and Cruelty; the other
was that dete&s;table Policy which in&s;pir'd them to
ma&s;&s;acre all that had any remains of Liberty, or
endeavour'd to &s;hake off their Tyrannical Yoke, and
to free them&s;elves from &s;o unju&s;t and intolerable a
Slavery; for this the brave&s;t, mo&s;t potent, and mo&s;t
warlike Nations off the <HI>Indians</HI> attempted. When
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had kill'd all the Men in the War, they
&s;uffer'd the Women and Children to live, but with
the impo&s;ition of a Yoke &s;o cruel and in&s;upportable,
that their Condition was rendred as mi&s;erable as that
of Bea&s;ts. A multitude of other particular methods
were taken for the de&s;truction of the&s;e poor <HI>Ame|ricans,</HI>
but they may be reduc'd in general to tho&s;e
two we have mentioned.</P>
<P>The Gold and Silver the&s;e People had in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
was the Motive that violently prompted the
<HI>Europeans</HI> to per&s;ecute and de&s;troy 'em. The ear|ne&s;t
de&s;ire they had of &s;peedily enriching them&s;elves,
in order to procure &s;uch Honour and Dignity as far
exceeded their Condition, in&s;pir'd 'em with all this
inhumanity. In a word, their Avarice and Ambi|tion
were arriv'd to an exce&s;s beyond Imagination;
the immen&s;e Riches of the new World, the tracta|ble,
&s;weet, and good di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
which render'd a de&s;cent into their Country ea&s;y to
any that would attempt it, have occa&s;ion'd all the
Ravage and Spoil, all the horrid Ma&s;&s;acres and Cru|elties
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have caus'd 'em to &s;uffer.
They made &s;o little account of the mi&s;erable Inha|bitants
of the&s;e I&s;lands, that I may aver, without
<PB N="6" REF="12">
fear of being accus'd either of Impo&s;ture, or of &s;peak|ing
incon&s;iderately, &s;ince 'tis that of which I have
been an Eye-witne&s;s, that they valued them le&s;s, and
treated them wor&s;e than Bea&s;ts. They had &s;o little
regard to the Salvation of their Souls, that they
would not give them&s;elves the trouble &s;o much as to
&s;peak of the Chri&s;tian Faith and Sacraments to tho&s;e
numberle&s;s multitudes of Men and Women whom
they &s;acrific'd to their Ambition and Tyranny. And
that which aggravates the enormity of their Crimes,
is, that the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> had offer'd 'em no Inju|ry,
but on the contrary, gave 'em as much Honour
and Re&s;pect as if they had been &s;ent from Heaven;
till they were wearied out with repeated Outra|ges
and Ma&s;&s;acres, and con&s;train'd to betake them|&s;elves
to Arms contrary to their inclination, and to
repel force by force, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the
horrible Violences and In&s;ults of their Enemies, who
invented divers kinds of Torments for them, with
a Barbarity beyond all De&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD>A particular Account of what the Spaniards did
in Hi&s;paniola.</HEAD>
<P>AT this I&s;land the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arriv'd in their fir&s;t
Voyages, and here began to per&s;ecute and
murder the <HI>Indians,</HI> taking away their Wives and
Children, and u&s;ing 'em, or rather abu&s;ing 'em at
their plea&s;ure. They devour'd all that the&s;e poor
Creatures had ama&s;s'd together for their Sub&s;i&s;tence
with a great deal of Care and Labour, not content
with what they freely offer'd 'em as far as their Po|verty
and the meanne&s;s of their Condition would
permit: for they are &s;atisfied with what is of pure
Nece&s;&s;ity, not troubling them&s;elves with &s;uperfluities,
<PB N="7" REF="12">
or laying up great &s;tores before hand. One <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
would con&s;ume in a day, that which would
have &s;uffic'd three <HI>Indian</HI> Families of ten Per&s;ons
each, for the &s;pace of a whole Month. This ill
treatment and &s;poil &s;oon made the Inhabitants of
this I&s;land lo&s;e the E&s;teem they had conceiv'd of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they at fir&s;t look'd upon as me&s;|&s;engers
from Heaven: &s;o that at length they began
to hide their Wives and Children, and whatever
Goods they had from 'em. Some retired into Caves,
others fled up into the Mountains to avoid meeting
with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who now appear'd &s;o terrible and
cruel to 'em. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not content them|&s;elves
to beat 'em, and to offer 'em many other
Indignities, but cut their Throats in cold Blood:
and without any re&s;pect either to Age or Quality,
put their Princes, and the Governors of their Cities
to death: They came to that height of Impudence and
Villany, that a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain had the In&s;olence
to abu&s;e the Wife of the greate&s;t King of the
I&s;land. This vile fact drove 'em quite to de&s;pair,
&s;o that from that time they &s;ought means of dri|ving
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of their Country; they be|took
them&s;elves to Arms, and did what they could
to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the&s;e Tyrants: but
the Weapons they us'd were neither capable of
defending them, nor of offending their Enemies to
any purpo&s;e; and were more like tho&s;e that Chil|dren
u&s;e to play with, than &s;uch as are fit for Soul|diers
to u&s;e in War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were mounted on fine Hor&s;es,
and armed with Lances and Swords, look'd upon
Enemies &s;o meanly equip'd with the greate&s;t Con|tempt,
and committed the mo&s;t horrible Slaughters
with Impunity. They pa&s;s'd through the &s;everal
Cities and Towns, &s;paring neither Age nor Sex,
but kill'd Women and Children as well as Men:
<PB N="8" REF="13">
They rip'd up Women with Child, that Root and
Branch might be de&s;troy'd together. They laid
Wagers one with another, who &s;hould cleave a Man
down with his Sword mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly at one blow;
or who &s;hould take his Head from his Shoulders mo&s;t
cleverly; or who &s;hould run a Man through after
the mo&s;t artificial manner: They tore away Chil|dren
out of their Mothers Arms, and da&s;h'd out
their Brains again&s;t the Rocks; others they threw
into the River, diverting them&s;elves with this bru|ti&s;h
Sport, and giving great &s;houts while they &s;aw
'em in this mi&s;ery: And to add in&s;ulting Scoffs to
their Cruelty, advis'd 'em to &s;truggle in the Water,
and try if they could &s;ave them&s;elves from drowning.
They held up the Bodies of Mothers and Children
together upon their Lances: they &s;et up Gibbets,
and hang'd up thirteen of the&s;e poor Creatures in
honour to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his twelve Apo&s;tles (as
they bla&s;phemou&s;ly expre&s;s'd them&s;elves): They
kindled a great Fire under the&s;e Gibbets, to burn
tho&s;e they had hang'd upon 'em: They cut off the
Hands of tho&s;e they &s;av'd alive, and &s;ent 'em away
in that mi&s;erable condition, bidding 'em carry the
News of their Calamities to tho&s;e that were retir'd
into the Mountains to e&s;cape the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>They erected a &s;mall Scaffold, &s;upported with
Forks and Poles, upon which to execute their Chiefs,
and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable quality among
'em. When they had laid 'em at length upon this
Scaffold, they kindled a gentle Fire, to make 'em
feel them&s;elves die gradually, till the poor Wretches
after the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pain and Angui&s;h, attended
with horrible Screeches and Outcries, at length ex|pir'd.
I one day &s;aw four or five Per&s;ons of the
highe&s;t Rank in this I&s;land burn'd after this manner.
But the dreadful Cries this Torment extorted from
'em, incommoding a Spani&s;h Captain; and hindring
<PB N="9" REF="13">
his Sleep, he commanded 'em to be pre&s;ently
&s;trangled. But a certain Officer who&s;e Name I
know, and who&s;e Relations are well known at <HI>Se|ville,</HI>
put Gags into their Mouths to hinder 'em from
making a Noi&s;e, that he might not be depriv'd of
the bruti&s;h Plea&s;ure of broiling them gently, till
they breath'd out their Souls in this Torment. I
have been an Eye-witne&s;s of all the&s;e Cruelties, and
an infinite number of others which I pa&s;s over in
&s;ilence.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the&s;e poor People took all the care
they could to hide them&s;elves from a Generation of
Men &s;o barbarous and wicked as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
had no Sentiment of Humanity, Honour, or Reli|gion
left, but acted as if they were made for nothing
el&s;e but to de&s;troy Mankind; to add further to their
bruti&s;h Cruelty, they taught Dogs to go a hunting
for the&s;e poor Wretches, and to devour 'em as if they
had been Bea&s;ts. And becau&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> after
they had been provok'd with &s;o many unheard of
Injuries, now and then kill'd one of them when
they met with 'em &s;tragling; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made
a Law among them&s;elves to ma&s;&s;acre a hundred <HI>In|dians</HI>
for every <HI>Spaniard</HI> they &s;hould kill.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Kingdoms contain'd in the I&s;land of

<P><HI>HI&s;paniola</HI> contains five great Kingdoms, the
Kings of which were very powerful, and go|vern'd
all the other Chiefs, who&s;e number is very
great: yet there are &s;ome independent Countries
which have their particular Lords, and are not
&s;ubject to any of tho&s;e Kings. One of the&s;e Kings
they call <HI>Magua,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Plain,</HI> his Name
<PB N="10" REF="14">
being taken from the &s;ituation of his Kingdom,
which is extremely plea&s;ant. This Plain is 80
Leagues in extent from South to North, but is
only five, eight, and &s;ometimes ten Leagues in
breadth. 'Tis encompa&s;s'd on every &s;ide with high
Mountains; 'tis water'd with a great number of
Brooks and Rivers, of which there are twelve that
come not behind tho&s;e famous Rivers the <HI>Ebre,</HI>
the <HI>Duere,</HI> and the <HI>Guadalquivir</HI> for bigne&s;s. The
Rivers that water this Plain, e&s;pecially tho&s;e falling
down from a Mountain that looks towards the We&s;t,
abound with Gold. This Mountain bounds the
Province of <HI>Cibao,</HI> where the Mines bearing that
Name produce that pure Gold of the finene&s;s of
24 Carrats, &s;o much talk'd of in <HI>Europe.</HI> The So|veraign
of this Kingdom was call'd <HI>Guarionex;</HI> he
had under him &s;uch powerful Subjects, that one of
'em could bring 16000 Men into the field for
the King's Service. I knew &s;ome of the&s;e Indian
Lords. This King was very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the Kings
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and expre&s;s'd a great deal of Affection to
them. His Humour was mild and peaceable; and
his Soul capable of every Vertue. He once or|der'd
all his Subjects to bring him each of 'em a
great Pur&s;e of Gold; but finding they were not in a
condition to an&s;wer his Requirement, he remitted
half this Tax. The Inhabitants of this I&s;land have
not the Art of extracting Gold out of the Mines.
This <HI>Cacique</HI> voluntarily offer'd him&s;elf to the Ser|vice
of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on condition the Queen
<HI>I&s;abella</HI> would take care that tho&s;e Lands &s;hould be
cultivated, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inhabited at their
fir&s;t Arrival in the <HI>Indies,</HI> extending about the &s;pace
of 50 Leagues towards <HI>St. Domingo:</HI> for he &s;aid his
Subjects had no Experience or Skill to extract Gold
out of the Mines. If this Condition had been ac|cepted,
he would faithfully and joyfully have accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="14">
his Promi&s;e, which would have been of va&s;t
advantage to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who might have
taken above three Millions of Gold every year out
of the&s;e Mines; and con&s;equently there might now
have been fifty Cities in this Province as fine as
<HI>Seville.</HI></P>
<P>But what greateful Acknowledgments did the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> return to the kind Offers of this Prince,
who gave &s;uch Proofs of his Good-will to 'em, and
&s;incere de&s;ire to &s;erve 'em? They cover'd him with
Shame and Infamy, his Wife was violated (as has
been &s;aid) by a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, a Wretch un|worthy
of the Chri&s;tian Name. This Prince might
have waited for an opportunity to revenge him&s;elf
of this Outrage, but cho&s;e rather to retire and live
in Ob&s;curity and Exile in the Province of one of his
Subjects, voluntarily abidicating his Kingdom and
Government. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being inform'd of the
place of his Retreat, pur&s;ued him with the utmo&s;t
Fury, without giving him time to hide him&s;elf. They
cruelly declar'd War again&s;t that Indian Lord that
had given him Sanctuary, and had receiv'd him with
a becoming Humanity and Re&s;pect; they ravag'd
all his Country, and never left off their Cruelties
till they had found and &s;eiz'd this Fugitive Prince,
whom they loaded with Chains, and put on Ship|board
to be carried into <HI>Spain</HI> as their Pri&s;oner.
This Ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;t away in the Voyage, a great
many <HI>Spaniards</HI> drown'd, and an incredible &s;um of
Gold and Silver lo&s;t: Among the re&s;t there was a
prodigious lump of Gold as big as a great Loaf,
which weighed 3600 Crowns. Thus did the Ven|geance
of God meet with 'em for the enormous
Crimes they had committed in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Kingdom is called <HI>Marien,</HI> where
there is a fine Port ju&s;t at the end of the other
Kingdom on the North-&s;ide: This Kingdom is
<PB N="12" REF="15">
larger than <HI>Portugal,</HI> and more fruitful, and was
&s;tor'd with va&s;t numbers of Inhabitants; there are
divers Mountains in it, and &s;everal Mines abounding
with Gold and Copper. The Name of the King
of this Country was <HI>Guacanagari,</HI> who had divers
Lords under his Juri&s;diction. 'Twas in this Coun|try
that famous Pilot who fir&s;t di&s;cover'd <HI>America</HI>

Ho&s;pitality and Civility; he made the be&s;t

accompanied him: when their Ship was &s;unk, they
were receiv'd at this Prince's Court as kindly as if
they had been in the Hou&s;es of their own natural
Relations: here they met with all manner of Re|fre&s;hments
and Recruits the Country afforded, which
were given 'em with great Expre&s;&s;ions of Humanity
and Compa&s;&s;ion on the account of their Hard&s;hips.
This King afterwards to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the
barbarous U&s;age of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they began
to commit their Ma&s;&s;acres in his Country, abandon'd
his Kingdom, and was forc'd to retreat into &s;ome
of the remote Mountains, where he died with the
Fatigues and Inconveniencies to which he was ex|pos'd.
Tho&s;e Indian Lords that depended on him

<P><HI>Maguana</HI> is the third Kingdom of this I&s;land,

the other Kings both in regard of his Power, the
Riches of his Kingdom, and the Re&s;pect and Cere|mony
with which he was honour'd. This Prince
not keeping on his Guard, nor at all di&s;tru&s;ting

&s;urpriz'd in his own Hou&s;e by the Artifices they had

loaded with Chains peri&s;h'd, together with the

Soveraign, and inform'd of the Ravage and Ma&s;&s;a|cres

Kingdoms, and after all hearing the News of the
fatal End of their Brother, betook them&s;elves to
Arms, and &s;ought means of revenging them&s;elves
on their Enemies. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> attack'd 'em with
their Cavalry, which is very formidable to the
<HI>Indians,</HI> whom they &s;oon conquer'd, and made &s;o
prodigious a Slaughter among 'em, that half the
Kingdom was depopulated and became de&s;ert after
this Defeat.</P>
<P><HI>Xavagua</HI> is the fourth Kingdom of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and
is as it were the Heart and Centre of all this I&s;land;
the Language of it is the mo&s;t refin'd and polite.
The People of this Kingdom are the mo&s;t civiliz'd,
and their Manners more cultivated than tho&s;e of
other parts of the Country: and there are a greater
number of great Lords and Per&s;ons of Quality
among 'em. The&s;e People are better &s;hap'd, and
have a finer A&s;pect than tho&s;e of the other King|doms.
The King's Name was <HI>Behechio,</HI> he had a
Si&s;ter call'd <HI>Anacaona;</HI> both of 'em heap'd their Fa|vours
<PB N="14" REF="16">
on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they landed in their
Country, and with a great deal of Genero&s;ity &s;av'd
'em from Death, which they could not otherwi&s;e
have avoided: They left no Stone unturn'd to &s;hew
them&s;elves obliging to the Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> After
<HI>Behechio</HI>'s Death his Si&s;ter <HI>Anacaona</HI> continued ab|&s;olute
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole Kingdom. One day
the Governor of the I&s;land, accompanied with 60
Hor&s;e and 300 Foot, &s;ends a Summons to about 300
of the greate&s;t Lords of the Country to attend his
Per&s;on. The&s;e few Hor&s;emen alone were able to
have ravag'd and laid wa&s;te not only all this I&s;land,
but even the whole Continent, &s;o defencele&s;s were
the&s;e poor People. The Indian Nobles, not at all
&s;u&s;pecting any treacherous De&s;ign, were by the Go|vernor's
Order brought into a Hou&s;e cover'd with
Straw, which he commanded to be &s;et on fire,
where they peri&s;h'd mi&s;erably. Tho&s;e of 'em who
attempted to e&s;cape were pur&s;ued by the Spani&s;h
Troopers, and kill'd without Mercy. They al&s;o
kill'd a va&s;t multitude of the common People, cut|ting
'em and running 'em through with their Swords
and Lances. This &s;ame Governor caus'd Queen
<HI>Anacaona,</HI> who had the &s;overaign Authority after
the Death of her Brother (as has been &s;aid) to be
hang'd, that he might di&s;grace the Memory of that
Prince&s;s as much as he could by &s;o vile and igno|minious
a Death. If at any time a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> either
touch'd with the Sentiments of Compa&s;&s;ion, or
prompted with tho&s;e of Avarice, thought fit to
&s;pare one of the&s;e poor Wretches for his own Ser|vice;
another would come tran&s;ported with Rage,
and fall upon him in his pre&s;ence, and either run
him through the Body, or cut off his Legs, &s;o as to
render him un&s;erviceable. Some of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>
who e&s;cap'd this Ma&s;&s;acre retir'd into an I&s;land not
above eight Leagues di&s;tant from this Kingdom, to
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;helter them&s;elves from the Fury of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
but the&s;e were condemned by the Governor to
perpetual Slavery.</P>
<P>The Name of the fifth Kingdom is <HI>Hiquey: Hi|quanama</HI>

much advanc'd in Years and decrepit, was hang'd by
order of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who tormented an infinite
number of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom by di|vers
kinds of cruel Puni&s;hments. Some they burn'd
alive, they cut off the Arms and Legs of others,
and made Slaves of the re&s;t. There are &s;o many
things to be &s;aid of the ill Treatment and Cruelty
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> exercis'd again&s;t the People of this
I&s;land, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to recount 'em all; and if
that could be done, the recital of 'em would ap|pear
incredible: and yet the <HI>Indians</HI> gave the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
no occa&s;ion to engage in &s;o barbarous a War
again&s;t 'em, and to commit &s;uch Violences upon
'em; but one may truly &s;ay, the&s;e poor Creatures
liv'd in as great Subjection and Obedience to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> as the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and ob&s;equious

Mona&s;tery; &s;o that there was no lawful
occa&s;ion given 'em to rob tho&s;e of their Property,
or condemn 'em to a rigorous Slavery, who had
found means of e&s;caping their bloody Ma&s;&s;acres.
'Tis further to be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Indians</HI> offer'd
no Affront to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they fir&s;t arriv'd
in <HI>America:</HI> So that they had no colourable Pretext
for Revenge, or the lea&s;t right to puni&s;h 'em after &s;o
cruel a manner. As for tho&s;e Sins, the Puni&s;hment
of which God has re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf, &s;uch as Hatred,
Envy, the pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of Revenge, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
had no occa&s;ion to reproach 'em on this ac|count,
&s;ince the&s;e People have &s;carce more Strength
and Courage than Children of ten Years old. On
the other &s;ide, the <HI>Indians</HI> had a thou&s;and ju&s;t Rea|&s;ons
<PB N="16" REF="17">
to make War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho the&s;e had
no rea&s;onable pretence to treat them as they did
with a barbarity equal to that of the mo&s;t &s;avage
and inhuman Tyrants.</P>
<P>After this unju&s;t War was ended with the De|&s;truction
and Ma&s;&s;acre of all the Inhabitants of the&s;e
Countries, having re&s;erv'd few be&s;ides the Women
and Children, they divided the&s;e among them&s;elves,
&s;ome keeping 30 of them, others 40, others 100,
&s;ome 200, according to the Intere&s;t they had in the
Tyrant of the I&s;land, whom they honour'd with the
Title of Governor; for 'twas he that gave 'em
the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> on condition they would cau&s;e 'em to
be in&s;tructed in the Maxims of the Catholick Reli|gion,
tho the Per&s;ons to who&s;e care he committed
'em were the mo&s;t ignorant, cruel, covetous, and
vitious of all Mankind. The&s;e (as might well have
been expected) took no care to in&s;truct 'em; but
confined the men to the Mines to get out Gold with
incredible Toil and Labour; they us'd the Women
for Husbandry and Tillage, tho this la&s;t was a La|bour
hard enough for men of the mo&s;t robu&s;t and
vigorous Con&s;titution. They fed 'em only with
Herbs, or &s;uch like Food, that had but little Sub|&s;tance
or Nouri&s;hment in it: So that the Milk dry'd
up in the Brea&s;ts of the Women that gave &s;uck, and
their Children in a little time pin'd away and dyed
with Faintne&s;s and Hunger. The Men having no
Conver&s;ation with the Women, but dwelling in &s;e|parate
Hou&s;es, there could be no farther propaga|tion
of Children by 'em. Thus at length the Men
peri&s;h'd in the Mines with Hunger and Labour, the
Women dyed under the pre&s;&s;ure of their &s;ervitude
in the Fields; &s;o that all the Inhabitants of this po|pulous
I&s;land were exterminated in a &s;hort time.
And indeed if the &s;ame cour&s;e were taken every
where el&s;e, all Mankind would be de&s;troy'd in the
<PB N="17" REF="17">
&s;pace of a few Years. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> oblig'd the&s;e
poor Creatures to carry Burdens of four&s;core or a
hundred pound weight for a hundred or two hun|dred

more at ea&s;e, they would make the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> carry

require whole Volumes, and the reading of &s;o de|plorable

<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd that the De&s;truction and De&s;o|lation
of the&s;e Provinces began &s;ince the Death of
the mo&s;t &s;erene Queen <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who departed this
Life in the Year 1504. Before this time the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
never dur&s;t exerci&s;e their Cruelties on the
People of this I&s;land, nor de&s;troy their Country: if
they offer'd 'em any Violence, 'twas as it were by
&s;tealth, and with great Precaution. But after the
Death of this Prince&s;s, the De&s;olation became gene|ral.
Before this fatal time, they took great care to
conceal whatever Hard&s;hips they made the&s;e People
endure, becau&s;e the Queen was marvellou&s;ly zealous
both to promote the In&s;truction and Salvation of the
Inhabitants of this new World, and to advance their
Temporal Advantages; and accordingly &s;he gave us
many Examples of her Piety and Zeal.</P>
<P>In whatever part of <HI>America</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;et
their Feet, they perpetrated the &s;ame abominable
<PB N="18" REF="18">
Villanies and Ma&s;&s;acres, to oppre&s;s and exterminate
the&s;e poor Innocents. They &s;eem'd to take Plea|&s;ure
in the invention of new kinds of Torments,
and their Fury augmented every day more and
more, till God Almighty provok'd by &s;o many hor|rid
Crimes, abandon'd 'em to a reprobate Sen&s;e,
and permitted 'em to fall as it were from deep to

<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> pa&s;s'd into the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba</HI> in
the year 1511, which contains as much ground
in length as from <HI>Vallidolid</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> There were

have redoubled their Cruelty upon tho&s;e People.
There happen'd divers things in this I&s;land that de|&s;erve
to be remark'd. A rich and potent <HI>Cacique</HI>
nam'd <HI>Hathuey</HI> was retir'd into the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> to
avoid that Slavery and Death with which the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
menac'd him: and being inform'd that his
per&s;ecutors were upon the point of landing in this
I&s;land, he a&s;&s;embled all his Subjects and Dome&s;ticks
together, and made a Speech to 'em after this man|ner.
<HI>You know</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>the Report that is &s;pread
abroad, that the</HI> Spaniards <HI>are ready to invade this
I&s;land; and you are not ignorant of the ill &V;&s;age our

<HI>of the ill Intentions of the People of whom I am &s;peaking?
We know not</HI> (&s;ay they all with one Voice) <HI>upon
what account they come hither, but we know they are a
very wicked and cruel People. I'll tell you then</HI> (reply'd
the <HI>Cacique) that the&s;e Europeans wor&s;hip a very cove|tous
&s;ort of God, &s;o that 'tis difficult to &s;atisfy him; and
to perform the Wor&s;hip they render to this Idol, they'll
exact immen&s;e Trea&s;ures of us, and will u&s;e their utmo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Endeavour to reduce us to a mi&s;erable &s;tate of Slavery,
or el&s;e to put us to death.</HI> Upon which he took a Box
full of Gold and valuable Jewels which he had with
him, and expo&s;ing it to their view: <HI>Here is</HI> (&s;ays
he) <HI>the God of the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>whom we mu&s;t honour
with our Sports and Dances, to &s;ee if we can appea&s;e
him, and render him propitious to us; that &s;o he may
command the</HI> Spaniards <HI>not to offer us any Injury.</HI>
They all applauded this Speech, and fell a leaping
and dancing round the Box, till they had quite
tired and &s;pent them&s;elves. After which the <HI>Cacique
Hathucy</HI> re&s;uming his Di&s;cour&s;e, continued to &s;peak
to them in the&s;e terms: <HI>If we keep this God</HI> (&s;ays he)
<HI>till he's taken away from us, he'll certainly cau&s;e our
Lives to be taken from us; and therefore I am of opinion
'twill be the be&s;t way to ca&s;t him into the River.</HI> They
all approv'd of this Advice, and went all together
with one accord to throw this pretended God into
the River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were no &s;ooner arriv'd in the I&s;le
of <HI>Cuba,</HI> but this <HI>Cacyque</HI> who knew 'em too well,
began to think of retreating, to &s;ecure him&s;elf from
their Fury, and re&s;olv'd to defend him&s;elf by force
of Arms, if he &s;hould happen to meet with them;
but he unfortunately fell into their Hands: and be|cau&s;e
he had taken all the precautions he could to a|void
the Per&s;ecutions of &s;o cruel and impious a Peo|ple,
and had taken Arms to defend his own Life, as
well as the Lives of his Subjects; this was made a
capital Crime in him, for which he was burn'd a|live.
While he was in the mid&s;t of the Flames, tied
to a Stake, a certain Franci&s;can Frier of great Piety
and Vertue, took upon him to &s;peak to him of God
and our Religion, and to explain to him &s;ome Arti|cles
of the Catholick Faith, of which he had never
heard a word before, promi&s;ing him Eternal Life,
if he would believe, and threatning him with eter|nal
<PB N="21" REF="19">
Torment, if he continued ob&s;tinate in his Infi|delity.
<HI>Hathuey</HI> reflecting on the matter, as much
as the Place and Condition in which he was would
permit, ask'd the Frier that in&s;tructed him, whe|ther
the Gate of Heaven was open to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
and being an&s;wer'd that &s;uch of 'em as were good
men might hope for entrance there: The <HI>Cacyque,</HI>
without any farther deliberation, told him, he had
no mind to go to Heaven, for fear of meeting with
&s;uch cruel and wicked Company as they were; but
would much rather choo&s;e to go to Hell, where he
might be deliver'd from the trouble&s;om &s;ight of &s;uch
kind of People: To &s;o great a degree have the wicked
Actions and Cruelties of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> di&s;honor'd
God and his Religion in the Minds of the <HI>Americans.</HI></P>
<P>One day there came to us a great number of the
Inhabitants of a famous City, &s;ituate above 10
Leagues from the place where we lodg'd, to com|plement
us, and bring us all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions and
Refre&s;hments, which they pre&s;ented us with great
marks of Joy, care&s;&s;ing us after the mo&s;t obliging
manner they could. But that evil Spirit that po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> put 'em into &s;uch a &s;udden Fury
again&s;t 'em, that they fell upon 'em and ma&s;&s;acred
above 3000 of 'em, both Men and Women, upon
the &s;pot, without having receiv'd the lea&s;t Offence
or Provocation from 'em. I was an Eye-witne&s;s of
this Barbarity; and whatever endeavours were

to reduce 'em to Rea&s;on; &s;o re&s;olutely
were they bent to &s;atiate their brutal Rage by this
barbarous Action.</P>
<P>Soon after this I &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to the mo&s;t noted
<HI>Indians</HI> of the Province of <HI>Havane,</HI> to encourage
and engage 'em to continue in their Country, and
not to trouble them&s;elves to &s;eek remote places to
hide in, and advis'd 'em to come to us with a&s;&s;urance
<PB N="22" REF="20">
of our Protection. They knew well enough what
Authority I had over the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and I gave 'em
my word, no Injury &s;hould be offer'd 'em: for the
pa&s;t Cruelties and Ma&s;&s;acres their Country-men had
&s;uffer'd, had &s;pread Fear and Terror through all the
Country; and this A&s;&s;urance I gave 'em was with
the Con&s;ent and Advice of the Captains and other
Officers. When we enter'd into this Province, two
and twenty of their Chiefs came to us, and the ve|ry
next Morning the Commander of our Troops,
without any regard to the Promi&s;e that had been
made 'em, would needs &s;entence 'em to be burnt,
pretending 'twas be&s;t to put the&s;e People to death,

to avoid the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and abun|dance

them&s;elves to this kind of Death, hoping thus in a
moment to put a period to the Mi&s;eries their Per|&s;ecutors
inflicted on 'em.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Spaniard</HI> who had the Title of Sove|raign
in this I&s;land, and had three hundred <HI>In|dians</HI>
in his Service, de&s;troy'd a hundred and &s;ixty

Labour he continually exacted of 'em. The Recruits
he took to fill up their places were de&s;troy'd after

unpeopled the whole I&s;land, if Death, which took
him out of the way very happily for tho&s;e poor
Wretches, had not &s;helter'd 'em from his Cruelties.
I &s;aw with with my own Eyes above &s;ix thou&s;and
Children die in the &s;pace of three or four Months,

condemn'd to the Mines. After this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>

were retir'd into the Mountains, and ma&s;&s;acred mul|titudes

&s;ent into <HI>America,</HI> imitated the Conduct of the&s;e
covetous Governors, and made u&s;e of his Servants
to procure him&s;elf a &s;hare of the Spoil. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in a little time carried away above three
Millions out of this Kingdom; of which va&s;t Sum
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had &s;carce 3000 Crowns for his
&s;hare. Here were above 800000 People &s;laughter'd;
and the &s;ucceeding Governors continued the like
Ma&s;&s;acres till they had de&s;troy'd the re&s;t of the Na|tives.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in &s;ilence one Action com|mitted
in this Country by the Governor, of whom
I have been &s;peaking. A <HI>Cacique,</HI> whether volun|tarily
or out of fear I know not, gave him the weight
of 9000 Crowns in Gold: This great Sum not con|tenting
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they tied this unhappy Prince
to a Stake, and &s;etting fire to his Feet, endeavour'd
by this means to extort a greater quantity from him.
This Torment being intolerable to him, he gave
'em the weight of 3000 Crowns of Gold more,
which he had re&s;erv'd; upon this they renew'd their
Tortures, to get &s;till more out of him: but whether
he had no more to give 'em, or whether he was
re&s;olv'd they &s;hould exact no more of him, he ex|pir'd
amid&s;t their Tortures. They put to death
many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of this
Kingdom after the &s;ame cruel manner.</P>
<P>A Company of <HI>Spaniards</HI> happening to light on a
Body of <HI>Indians</HI> that had retreated into the Moun|tains,
<PB N="27" REF="22">
to avoid the Tyranny of their Per&s;ecutors,
in a great rage fell upon the poor Wretches, and
killing all the Men they could catch, carried away
three or four&s;core Women Pri&s;oners. The <HI>Indians</HI>
that e&s;cap'd being highly incens'd, came in Arms to
attack the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to try if they could oblige
'em to let go their Prey: The&s;e &s;eeing the <HI>Indians</HI>
draw near 'em, and being unwilling to &s;urrender
the Booty they had taken, &s;tab'd the Women and
Maids in the pre&s;ence of their Husbands and Fathers,
who were &s;eiz'd with Horror and De&s;pair at the
&s;ight of &s;o lamentable a Tragedy; and &s;miting their
Brea&s;ts, cry'd out, <HI>O mercile&s;s Men! O cruel Spa|niards!
who can murder poor Women that never offended
you without Pity!</HI> And indeed they mu&s;t be more &s;a|vage
and bloody than Bea&s;ts of Prey, who can be
capable of &s;uch bruti&s;h Actions as the&s;e.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t Lords of this Country,
who&s;e Name was <HI>Paris,</HI> had a Hou&s;e about ten or
fifteen Leagues di&s;tance from <HI>Panama;</HI> he was very
rich, having a great quantity of Gold in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on.
When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came to his Hou&s;e, he re|ceiv'd
'em with as much Kindne&s;s and Civility as if
they had been his Relations. He frankly gave the
Captain the value of 15000 Crowns: This Captain,
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that accompanied him, concluded
that this Indian mu&s;t needs have immen&s;e Trea&s;ures,
from the parcel of Gold he had given 'em; and
&s;ince they had undertaken this Journey on purpo&s;e
to rob him, to make the more &s;ure of &s;ucceeding in
their De&s;ign, they pretended they would be gone,
and accordingly took their leave of him, but re|turn'd
in the middle of the Night, and ru&s;hing into
the City unexpectedly, they &s;et it on fire, and de|&s;troy'd
abundance of the Citizens in the Flames,
and carried away thence 50 or 60000 Crowns. A
Per&s;on of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Quality of any in
<PB N="28" REF="23">
this City e&s;cap'd the fury of this Fire; and after a
Re&s;pite of three or four days, having got as many
Men together as he could, fell upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by
&s;urprize, kill'd about fifty of 'em, and retook all
the Spoil of the City which they had burnt, and
particularly the Value of 40000 Crowns, of which
they had plunder'd him: the re&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
made the be&s;t of their way and e&s;cap'd, but not
without a great many Wounds. Soon after this
they return'd with a greater Force to attack this
<HI>Cacique,</HI> and de&s;troy'd the greate&s;t part of his
Troops, making Slaves of the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Province of Nicaraqua.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1522, the forementioned Governor
undertook to &s;ubdue the Province of <HI>Nicaraqua.</HI>
The great Fertility of this Country, the Goodne&s;s of
the Air, and the va&s;t number of the Inhabitants
cannot be &s;ufficiently expre&s;s'd. There were Cities
in this Province four Leagues in length. The great
quantities of excellent Fruits that grow there, drew
together tho&s;e great multitudes of People. The&s;e
Cities being &s;ituate in va&s;t Plains, the People had
no Mountains near in which to hide them&s;elves;
be&s;ides, the Climat is &s;o &s;weet, and the Country &s;o
agreeable, that the Inhabitants could not ea&s;ily re|&s;olve
to quit it, and con&s;equently were the more
expos'd to the Outrages and Per&s;ecutions of the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet they &s;uffer'd all with as much pa|tience
as was po&s;&s;ible, that they might not be oblig'd
to change their Dwelling. And tho the&s;e People
are naturally of a mild and peaceable Temper, the
Governor, or rather the Tyrant, with the Mini&s;ters
of his Cruelty, re&s;olv'd to treat the <HI>Indians</HI> of this
<PB N="29" REF="23">
Province after the &s;ame manner he had done tho&s;e
of other Kingdoms. Here he committed &s;o many
Enormities, &s;uch Robberies and Ma&s;&s;acres, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for any Pen to relate 'em all. He &s;ent
50 Troopers into this Province, which is bigger than
the Country of <HI>Rou&s;illon,</HI> who ma&s;&s;acred almo&s;t all
the Inhabitants, without any regard to Age, Sex or
Quality. If the&s;e poor Creatures fail'd to bring
'em a certain mea&s;ure of Corn which they exacted
of 'em, or did not &s;end into their Service &s;uch a
number of Slaves as they demanded, they kill'd 'em
without Mercy. And this being a plain Country
(as has been &s;aid) there was no place to &s;helter 'em
from the Spani&s;h Hor&s;e, who pur&s;u'd 'em with the
utmo&s;t Fury.</P>
<P>The General permitted the&s;e Villains to commit
all the In&s;olencies and Robberies they pleas'd, and
to take as great a number of Pri&s;oners as they de&s;ir'd.
The&s;e they &s;ometimes loaded with Chains of &s;ixty
or eighty Pound weight; &s;o that of 4000 Captives,
&s;carce &s;ix were able to endure this Fatigue, the re&s;t
all dy'd by the way under the intolerable weight of
their Fetters. That they might not have the trouble
to open the Chains of &s;uch as dy'd with Hunger,
Thir&s;t, Wearine&s;s and Toil, they cut off their
Heads. When the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pre|pare
for the&s;e kind of Journeys, well knowing they
were never likely to &s;ee their Friends and Country|men
any more, they, with many deep Sighs and
Groans, and floods of Tears, utter'd their Com|plaints
after this manner. <HI>Time was</HI> (&s;ay they)
<HI>when we have travell'd the&s;e Journeys to &s;erve the Chri&s;ti|ans,
and have been &s;uffer'd after a certain &s;pace of time
to return home to our Wives and Children, but now there
is no hope of any &s;uch return; and this Separation mu&s;t
be for ever.</HI></P>
<P>One day a Fancy came into the Governors Head,
<PB N="30" REF="24">
to make a new di&s;tribution of the <HI>Indians;</HI> he took
'em away from tho&s;e for whom he had no kindne&s;s,
and gave a greater number to tho&s;e he re&s;pected.
This chopping and changing of Slaves occa&s;ion'd a
great &s;carcity for one Year, there being but a very
&s;mall Crop on the ground. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> endea|vour'd
to &s;upply this defect by taking from the <HI>In|dians</HI>
all the Corn and other Provi&s;ions which they
had laid up in &s;tore for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of their
Families. This Di&s;order produc'd a Famin among
'em, which de&s;troy'd above thirty thou&s;and People.
There was one Woman &s;o intolerably pre&s;s'd with
Hunger, that &s;he kill'd her Child to appea&s;e her
Appetite.</P>
<P>All the Cities and Fields round 'em are like plea|&s;ant
Gardens, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cultivated ac|cording
to the &s;hare each one had a&s;&s;ign'd him by
Lot: and to &s;ave their own Revenues, they fed up|on
the Stores that belong'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and liv'd
at their Charge, devouring in a few days what the&s;e
poor People had been a long time getting together
with a great deal of Care and Toil. There was
no <HI>Spaniard</HI> but had an E&s;tate of his own, and kept
abundance of <HI>Indians</HI> in his Hou&s;e to manure his
Land, and to do other Dome&s;tick Bu&s;ine&s;s: and none
of the&s;e were exempted from Slavery, their Nobles,
their Women and Children were made to work day
and night for the advantage of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
exacted Tasks of 'em quite beyond their Strength,
and mi&s;erably wore 'em out with exce&s;s of Labour
and Hard&s;hip. They drove 'em out of their Hou&s;es,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 'em; they &s;eiz'd their Goods
and Lands, and in&s;tantly con&s;um'd their Provi&s;ions,
thus reducing 'em to extreme nece&s;&s;ity. Many of 'em
dy'd under the heavy Burdens they oblig'd 'em to
carry on their Shoulders as far as the Port, which was
above 30 Leagues; for hither they made 'em bring
<PB N="31" REF="24">
Planks and pieces of Timber for the building of
Ve&s;&s;els. They forc'd 'em to go and &s;eek for Honey
and Wax in the Mountains, where they were de|vour'd
by Tygers: Women big with Child were
not exempted from the&s;e hard Services, and often
peri&s;h'd together with their Fruit, under the pre&s;&s;ure
of this rigorous Slavery.</P>
<P>That which contributed yet farther to unpeople
this Province, was the liberty the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took to
exact of the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and riche&s;t <HI>Indians,</HI> a great
number of Slaves. This kind of Tribute was au|thoriz'd
by the Governor, and levied with a great
deal of Severity; for he threaten'd to burn 'em alive
if they fail'd to &s;end him a Recruit of fifty Slaves
every three Months, or as often as he &s;hould give
order: tho the <HI>Indians</HI> have no great number of
Slaves ordinarily, and 'tis much if a <HI>Cacique</HI> has three
or four among his other Dome&s;ticks. If a Father
had two Children, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would take away
one of them, or two if he had three: The Parents
mu&s;t &s;ubmit, with how great Reluctancy &s;oever; but
their Children were not ravi&s;h'd from 'em without
abundance of Tears and dolorous Complaints; for
they have a very tender Affection to their Off|&s;pring,
and breed 'em up with abundance of Care.
This kind of Tribute being often extorted, all this
Kingdom was in a few years depopulated. There
arriv'd five or &s;ix Ships here every year, which were
laden with Slaves, whom they tran&s;ported into
<HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> and there &s;old 'em, where they
died in a little time; for it has been confirm'd by
many Experiments, that tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that are tran&s;|ported
from their Native Country into other Cli|mats,
&s;eldom live long: And that which contri|buted
to kill 'em the &s;ooner, was the neglect of &s;up|plying
'em with &s;ufficient Su&s;tenance, and the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Labour with which they were over-charg'd.
<PB N="32" REF="25">
In the &s;pace of a few Years there were above
500000 Slaves drawn out of this Province, tho they
were all burn free: and during the War that was
made again&s;t 'em, there dy'd about fifty or &s;ixty
thou&s;and be&s;ides the&s;e: the re&s;t were condemn'd to
cruel Slavery, in which a con&s;iderable number dy'd
every day. There are about four or five thou&s;and

<P><HI>NEw Spain</HI> was di&s;cover'd in the year 1517, and
the year following the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to ra|vage
it, and to ma&s;&s;acre the Inhabitants, tho they
pretend to go out of <HI>Europe</HI> to people this Country.
Their Violences and Oppre&s;&s;ions arriv'd to &s;uch a
height, that they had no regard either to God or
the King, but forgot both that they were Men and
Chri&s;tians. Since they came into this Country, there
has been nothing but Rapine and Spoil, Ma&s;&s;acres,
and buring of Cities, nothing but Tyranny and
Violence; &s;o that they have in a &s;hort time depo|pulated
and ruined va&s;t Kingdoms from one end to
t'other. The remembrance of the Villanies and
Cruelties committed there, has ca&s;t &s;uch a Terror
into the minds of the Natives, that they can't think
of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> without trembling. They have not
yet left off tormenting 'em; on the contrary
they rather grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and their Per&s;e|cutions

violent Deaths, both Men, Women and Chil|dren,

Prie&s;ts, led by him whom they look'd upon as their
High-prie&s;t, came with abundance of Solemnity and
Pomp to meet the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and that they might

that tho&s;e of the highe&s;t quality in the City &s;hould

make a horrible &s;laughter of 'em, thereby to render
them&s;elves the more formidable, and to &s;pread Ter|ror

us'd to ob&s;erve in every Country through which
they pa&s;s'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to make a great Ma&s;&s;acre at their

Sheep, might not look upon 'em without dread.
They deputed &s;ome to go and treat with the chief
Men of the City, and places adjacent, to engage
'em to come and meet 'em, that they might confer
together. The&s;e were no &s;ooner come to 'em, but
they put 'em in Chains, while the Inhabitants of
the City knew nothing of this Treachery. They
demanded 6000 <HI>Indians</HI> of 'em to carry their Bag|gage,
their Uten&s;ils and Provi&s;ions: When they
were come, they &s;hut 'em up in divers Yards, and
'twas a mi&s;erable Spectacle to &s;ee the poor Wretches

him&s;elf for a whole day. But the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who never gave Quarter to any one whom they
found in Arms, &s;et fire to the Temple, and burnt
all that were in it. They cry'd out of the mid&s;t

noble Pre&s;ents in Gold and Silver, and gave 'em
rich Stuffs painted with divers Colours: the King
him&s;elf receiv'd 'em at the entrance of the City with
all his Court, being carried upon a Golden Frame, or
Chair of State, and conducted 'em to the Palace
that was provided for 'em. But the &s;ame day they
&s;eiz'd this unfortunate Prince, who thought of no|thing
le&s;s, and po&s;ted four&s;core Souldiers to guard
him, having loaded him with a heavy Chain. This
Action put all the <HI>Indians</HI> in a Con&s;ternation and
Fear. But to augment their Terror, they contriv'd
to &s;ignalize their Cruelty by &s;ome memorable Action.
All the Nobility of the City was engag'd in repre|&s;enting
Plays and Shows, and in dancing round the
place where their King was impri&s;on'd, to allay the
Troubles of his Mind during his Captivity; in the&s;e

to join in with the&s;e Indian Sports, as if they were
mightily pleas'd with 'em, but withal giving 'em a
word to put the&s;e Dancers at a certain time to the

in no condition to defend them&s;elves from Souldiers

&s;ince in it they lo&s;t in a moment the mo&s;t illu&s;trious
Nobility of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> who had &s;uffer'd the Impri&s;onment of
their King with &s;o much patience, hearing of the
Ma&s;&s;acre of &s;o many young Noblemen, could not
but expre&s;s their Dete&s;tation of this &s;o bloody and
wicked a Fact, and took up Arms to revenge them|&s;elves:
and tho <HI>Monte&ccedil;uma</HI> had forbidden 'em to
offer the <HI>Spaniards</HI> any Violence, they attack'd 'em
vigorou&s;ly, and kill'd divers of 'em, and the re&s;t were
con&s;trained to retreat. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> put a Dagger
to their Prince's Brea&s;t, and &s;hew'd him in this
<PB N="38" REF="28">
po&s;ture to his Subjects through a Window, hoping
the &s;ight of it would oblige 'em to lay down their
Arms, which the Prince him&s;elf likewi&s;e command|ed
them to do; but they were too much provok'd
now to obey even his Orders. They cho&s;e one to
head 'em, and having put all their Troops under
his Command, attack'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o furiou&s;ly,
and fought with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy, that the&s;e con|cluding
they were not able to with&s;tand 'em, left
the City, and retreated in the middle of the night;
which the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving, pur&s;u'd 'em, and kill'd
a great number of 'em as they pa&s;s'd the Rivers.
However the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd &s;oon after with a
greater Strength, and a&s;&s;aulted and took the City,
in which they made a horrible &s;laughter, and burnt
tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that were of greate&s;t Note.</P>
<P>After they had committed all this Cruelty and
Spoil in the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they carried De&s;olation
with them into the Province of <HI>Panuco,</HI> which is
not above twenty Leagues di&s;tant from it, and here
exerci&s;ed their ordinary Barbarity. This Province
was mightily &s;tock'd with People: but &s;ince the ar|rival
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the greate&s;t part of 'em has
been cut off. The Province of <HI>Tute-peca,</HI> and that
of <HI>Colima</HI> underwent the &s;ame Fate; each of which
Provinces is as big as the Kingdoms of <HI>Leon</HI> and
<HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> invaded
the&s;e Provinces only to plunder and in&s;lave the In|habitants.
One of the fir&s;t things they did was to
oblige 'em to take the Oath of Allegiance to the
King of <HI>Spain;</HI> which if they refus'd to do, they
were pre&s;ently ma&s;&s;acred, or made Slaves. They
declar'd tho&s;e of 'em Rebels who came not to meet
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to &s;ubmit to their unju&s;t and cruel
Orders. Tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank among the <HI>In|dians</HI>
were accus'd of this Crime, and this was im|prov'd
<PB N="39" REF="28">
again&s;t 'em to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> without
con&s;idering that 'tis a plain Rule in Law, that none
can be term'd Rebels but Subjects that are revolted
from their Prince.</P>
<P>There's no good Chri&s;tian will make any dif|ficulty
to conclude, that &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries as the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have not the Qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to
in&s;inuate the Maxims of our Religion into the&s;e
People, who are naturally free, and know not how
to bear the Haughtine&s;s and In&s;olence with which
they have been treated: for they are peremptorily
told, you mu&s;t without any more ado &s;ubmit to the
Obedience of a Foreign Prince, whom you never
&s;aw nor heard of; and if you refu&s;e &s;o to do, we'll
cut you in pieces; and this no &s;ooner &s;aid but done.
But that which is more unaccountable is, that tho&s;e
who yield a blind Obedience to all they command
'em, are no better treated than the others; for they
are made mi&s;erable Slaves, they exact intolerable
Tasks of 'em, and condemn 'em to all &s;orts of Tor|ments:
So that whole Provinces, both Men, Women
and Children, are de&s;troy'd in a &s;hort time: Nay,
tho&s;e whom they kill outright are the happier &s;ort,
as having an end put to their Mi&s;eries in a moment.
But when they are forc'd by Menaces to promi&s;e
Fidelity and Obedience to a Foreign Prince, can it
be pretended they are oblig'd to it in Con&s;cience,
when this &s;uppos'd Duty is neither founded on the
Laws of God, nor tho&s;e of Nations? Be&s;ides, the
Threatnings that are made 'em are capable of ter|rifying
Men of the greate&s;t Courage and Re&s;olu|tion;
wherefore all the Promi&s;es obtain'd by &s;uch
menaces have no value nor obliging force. I pa&s;s
over in &s;ilence the Affronts, the In&s;ults and Injuries
that were offer'd the King of <HI>Mexico.</HI> In a word,
they have violated all the Laws of Nations, and
infinitely wrong'd and abus'd the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> This
<PB N="40" REF="29">
is all the Service the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have done the&s;e
People.</P>
<P>The Governor of this new World, &s;upported by
his imaginary Titles, &s;ent two Captains, &s;carce in|ferior
to him&s;elf in Impiety aad Cruelty, into the
Kingdoms of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> which are &s;ituate towards
the South: they pierc'd as far as the Kingdoms of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Gaymura,</HI> which extend Northward for
the &s;pace of about 300 Leagues; the&s;e Kingdoms
border upon that of <HI>Mexico.</HI> The&s;e Captains tra|vell'd
both by Sea and Land, accompanied with a
good party of Hor&s;e, and a con&s;iderable number of
Foot.</P>
<P>The Captain who&s;e Lot it was to travel into <HI>Gua|timala,</HI>
did a world of mi&s;chief there (the other
&s;oon dying) he carried De&s;olation with him every
where, and fill'd this Kingdom with Blood and Ruin,
to render the <HI>Spaniards</HI> formidable even to future
Generations. I am of opinion, that the mi&s;chief this
Captain did here &s;urpa&s;s'd whatever the <HI>Europeans</HI>
had done before in the new World. He went by
Sea, and carried Sword and Fire throughout all the
Coa&s;ts. Some of the Inhabitants of the Kingdom
of <HI>Yucatan,</HI> which is in the way to the Kingdoms of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Gaymura,</HI> made him magnificent Pre&s;ents:
yet as &s;oon as he had enter'd their Country, he &s;ent
his Souldiers into every part of it, who committed
horrible Spoil, and ma&s;&s;acred an infinite number of
the&s;e poor People. A furious <HI>Spaniard</HI> at the head
of 300 Men, enter'd the Country adjoining to <HI>Gua|timala,</HI>
&s;et fire to all their Cities, and cut the throats
of all the Inhabitants, without giving any quarter:
he carried away what Booty he could, and continued
to pillage the Country for the &s;pace of &s;ix&s;core
Leagues. This Captain had rebell'd, and revolted
again&s;t his General; and his de&s;ign in ruining the
Country after this manner was to put the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="29">
out of a condition to pur&s;ue him, by preventing
their finding Sub&s;i&s;tence in a Country thus ruin'd,
and by expo&s;ing 'em to the fury of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who
would omit nothing to revenge upon 'em the Injuries
and Mi&s;chiefs they had receiv'd from their Com|panions,
which fell out accordingly: For the Spani&s;h
General attempting to pur&s;ue this Rebel, was kill'd
by the <HI>Indians.</HI> Tho&s;e that &s;ucceeded him exer|ci&s;ed
all manner of Cruelties on 'em, and reduc'd al|mo&s;t
all of 'em to Slavery, after they had &s;poil'd 'em
of all their Goods, Provi&s;ions, Clothes, Corn, Wine
and other nece&s;&s;aries of Life. The Provinces of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Hondure,</HI> which were like Gardens of
Plea&s;ure, were turn'd into melancholy De&s;erts, al|tho
this Country was very full of People. 'Tis
impo&s;&s;ible to reflect on the&s;e things without being
&s;en&s;ibly touch'd and &s;often'd into Compa&s;&s;ion, tho
one were naturally of an obdurate and &s;owr Tem|per.
They kill'd two Millions of People in this
Country in le&s;s than ten years; &s;o that there are
&s;carce two thou&s;and left in all the va&s;t Extent of it;
and the&s;e are groaning under a heavy yoke of Bon|dage.
When they propos'd to 'em to take the Oath
of Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they would
give 'em no time to deliberate; they mu&s;t imme|diately
obey, or el&s;e die by Fire or Sword.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Guatimala.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ignaliz'd their entrance into this
Kingdom by divers Ma&s;&s;acres, tho the King
came to meet 'em in his Chair of State &s;upported
by his Slaves, follow'd by a great number of his Lords,
and with Trumpets and Drums before him, to give
the greater Te&s;timony of Joy; he &s;hew'd 'em all
<PB N="42" REF="30">
the Courte&s;y and Civility in the world, manife&s;ted
a great deal of Kindne&s;s in readily &s;upplying 'em
with plenty of Provi&s;ions, and gave 'em whatever
they could rea&s;onably de&s;ire. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> lodg'd
without the City the fir&s;t night, thinking they &s;hould
not be &s;ecure enough in a place &s;o well fortified.
The next day they engag'd the Prince of the place
to come out to 'em with the greate&s;t part of the
Per&s;ons of Quality, obliging to bring with them a
certain quantity of Gold. The <HI>Indians</HI> made an&s;wer
that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to do what was re|quir'd,
becau&s;e their Country did not yield this Me|tal.
However this refu&s;al &s;o mov'd the Indignation
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that for no other Offence, without
any formal Proce&s;s, they ca&s;t 'em all alive into a
great Fire. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Inhabitants of
the&s;e Provinces, &s;eeing their Ma&s;ters &s;o cruelly
treated, only becau&s;e they gave not the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
all the Gold they demanded, retir'd with all &s;peed
into the Mountains, ordering the common People
to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as their Ma&s;ters, and
giving 'em a &s;trict charge by no means to give the
lea&s;t notice of the places where they were gone to
hide them&s;elves. Abundance of the&s;e poor People
came accordingly to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> begging of 'em
to receive them into the number of their Servants,
and promi&s;ing to &s;erve 'em faithfully as far as they
were capable. The Spani&s;h Commander roughly
an&s;wer'd 'em, that he would not &s;o receive 'em, but
cut 'em to pieces without Mercy, unle&s;s they would
di&s;cover the places whither their Ma&s;ters were re|treated;
the <HI>Indians</HI> replied, they did not know:
however they readily offer'd them&s;elves, their
Wives and Children to their Service; and &s;aid, they
would continue in their Hou&s;es expecting their Or|ders;
they further told 'em, they might treat 'em
as they pleas'd, 'twas in their power either to kill
<PB N="43" REF="30">
'em, or to &s;ave 'em alive to employ 'em in their
&s;ervice. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this went into their
Villages and Towns, and found the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI>
with their Wives and Children bu&s;y at their Work,
and in great &s;ecurity, believing they had no need to
fear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would attack 'em; yet the&s;e blood-thir&s;ty
Men ma&s;&s;acred 'em without pity. After
this they went to another great Town, the Inha|bitants
of which confiding in their Innocence, thought
them&s;elves in no great danger; but this whole Town
was de&s;troy'd in le&s;s than two hours, and the Ma&s;|&s;acre
was &s;o general, that no Age, nor Sex, nor
Quality met with Pity, but all were put to the
Sword, unle&s;s &s;uch as fled before the arrival of the
<HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> at length finding it impo&s;&s;ible either
by their Patience, their Submi&s;&s;ions, or their Pre&s;ents
to &s;often the cruel and &s;avage Temper of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
who cut their Throats without any rea&s;on,
or any &s;entiment of Pity, re&s;olv'd to get together
in a body, and take Arms to defend them&s;elves: for
&s;eeing Death was inevitable to 'em, and become a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Evil, they cho&s;e rather to die with Weapons
in their hands, thereby to &s;ell their Lives at as dear
a rate as they could, and to revenge them&s;elves as
much as po&s;&s;ible on their Per&s;ecutors, than to &s;uffer
their Throats to be cut like Sheep without making
any re&s;i&s;tance. They wanted effectual Arms, they
were quite naked, and knew their Strength was
much inferior to that of their Enemies; they had
no Hor&s;es, nor did they under&s;tand the u&s;e of 'em
in Battel: they had to do with a furious and warlike
Enemy that gave 'em no quarter, and de&s;ign'd no|thing
but their Extirpation. They therefore thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e Stratagems: it came into their
heads to make Pits up and down the ways by which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to pa&s;s, and to cover 'em with
<PB N="44" REF="31">
Straw and Leaves that they might not be perceiv'd,
that &s;o their Hor&s;es might fall in 'em, and break their
Necks or Legs. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were two or
three times taken in the&s;e Traps, but afterwards
took care to avoid 'em, and re&s;olv'd to ca&s;t all the
<HI>Indians</HI> they could take into the&s;e Pits, whether
Men, Women or Children, of what Age or Con|dition
&s;oever; they threw in Women big with
Child, and old Men as well as others, till they had
quite fill'd 'em. It was a mo&s;t lamentable &s;ight to
&s;ee &s;ome Women empaled together with their Chil|dren,
and &s;o expos'd to the fury of greedy Dogs,
and others run through with Lances and Halberts.
They burnt one of the greate&s;t Lords of the Coun|try
with a gentle Fire, and in&s;ultingly told him 'twas
to do him the more honour, that they put him to
death after this manner. The&s;e Butcheries and Cru|elties
were committed for &s;even years together.
The Reader may conjecture what multitudes of poor
<HI>Indians</HI> were &s;laughter'd during &s;o tedious and
bloody a Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>'Tis fit to be remark'd, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were
receiv'd with great Acclamations, and with all the
demon&s;trations of a &s;incere Joy in the Province of
<HI>Cuzcatan,</HI> which is &s;ituate on the Sea-&s;ide, and ex|tends
forty or fifty Leagues in length. In this Pro|vince
is the famous City of <HI>St. Saviour; Cuzcatan</HI> is
the Metropolis of the Province. The&s;e People &s;ent
30000 <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> laden with Indian
Poultry, and all other Provi&s;ions the Country would
afford in great abundance. After they had receiv'd
the&s;e Pre&s;ents, the Spani&s;h General order'd his Men
to choo&s;e as many <HI>Indians</HI> as each of 'em de&s;ir'd for
their Service, while they remain'd in that Province:
Accordingly one took a hundred, another fifty, as
they had occa&s;ion to carry their Baggage. The&s;e
poor Wretches &s;erv'd them with all the care and
<PB N="45" REF="31">
diligence they could, and were even ready to wor|&s;hip
'em. At length the General demanded of 'em
a great quantity of Gold, that being the main bu&s;i|ne&s;s
for which he came: they with a great deal of
Humility and Submi&s;&s;ion, told him they would readi|ly
give him all they had, and pre&s;ently got together
all the Lances they had, which were made of Cop|per
gilt, and which they took for pure Gold by the
looks of it. The General &s;oon made trial of it, and
finding what it was, addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in the&s;e terms: <HI>We mu&s;t carry De&s;truction with
us</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>through all this Country, &s;eeing here's no
Gold to be found: Every one of you may keep the</HI> Indians
<HI>you have cho&s;en for your perpetual Slaves: You may load
'em with Chains, and brand 'em with the marks of their
Slavery:</HI> Which was immediately done: For they
printed the King's Arms with a hot Iron upon all
they could take. Tho&s;e of 'em that e&s;cap'd, provok'd
with the ill Treatment which they every where
met, a&s;&s;embled all the <HI>Indians</HI> they could to make an
Effort to deliver them&s;elves from the Per&s;ecutions
of their Enemies by force of Arms; but their En|terprize
was not &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;o that an incredible
number of 'em was kill'd.</P>
<P>After this Expedition the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd to
<HI>Guatimala,</HI> where they built a City; but God was
pleas'd by his ju&s;t Judgment utterly to overthrow,
and de&s;troy it. They kill'd all without Mercy whom
they &s;uppos'd to be in a condition to incommode
'em by their Arms, and the re&s;t were condemn'd to
Slavery. They extorted from 'em a Tribute of
Boys and Girls, and &s;ent 'em into <HI>Peru</HI> to be &s;old.
The other Inhabitants of this Kingdom, which is
100 Leagues in length, were likewi&s;e de&s;troy'd.
Thus one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fruitful Countries
in the World was reduc'd to a melancholy De&s;ert.
The Governor him&s;elf has freely confe&s;s'd, that this
<PB N="46" REF="32">
was the mo&s;t populous Country in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
not excepting <HI>Mexico</HI> it &s;elf, which is certainly
true. In this noble Country the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have de|&s;troy'd
no le&s;s than four or five Millions of Men in
fifteen or &s;ixteen years, and continue every day to
treat tho&s;e that remain after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e inhuman Creatures were wont when they
declar'd War again&s;t any City or Province, to bring
with 'em as many of the conquer'd <HI>Indians</HI> as they
could, to make 'em fight again&s;t their Country-men;
&s;ometimes they had fifteen or twenty thou&s;and of
the&s;e new Subjects among 'em. But becau&s;e they
were not able to furni&s;h 'em with all nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions,
they allow'd 'em to eat tho&s;e other <HI>Indians</HI>
whom they took in War, &s;o that in their Camp they
had Shambles &s;tor'd with human Fle&s;h. Infants were
kill'd in their &s;ight, and then broil'd and eaten;
Men were &s;laughter'd like Bea&s;ts, and their Legs
and Arms dre&s;s'd for food; for the <HI>Indians</HI> like the
ta&s;te of tho&s;e Parts better than others. The News
of the&s;e horrible Practices &s;oon alarm'd the neigh|bouring
Countries, and fill'd 'em with Terror and
Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Indians</HI> were worn out with carrying
the Tackle of the Spani&s;h Ships, which they would
needs have brought from the North to the South
Sea, which are 130 Leagues di&s;tant: They made
'em carry Anchors of a great weight all this long
way; they laid great Guns upon the naked Backs of
the&s;e poor Creatures, under the weight of which
they were not able to &s;tand; &s;o that the greate&s;t
part of 'em dy'd by the way, not being able to en|dure
the&s;e Fatigues. To increa&s;e their Mi&s;ery, they
divided their Families, taking Husbands from their
Wives, and Wives from their Husbands; their
Daughters were taken from 'em, and given to the
Seamen and Souldiers to &s;atisfy their Lu&s;t, and to
<PB N="47" REF="32">
appea&s;e their murmuring. They fill'd the Ships
with <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;uffer'd 'em to peri&s;h with Hunger
and Thir&s;t; becau&s;e they would take no care to fur|ni&s;h
'em with Nece&s;&s;aries. But to give a particular
account of all their Cruelties would require large
Volumes, the view of which would a&s;toni&s;h all that
&s;hould have the curio&s;ity to look into 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had two powerful Fleets de&s;tin'd
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
How many Parents have they bereav'd of their
Children! How many Children of their Parents!
of how many Adulteries and other infamous Practi|ces
have they been the Cau&s;es, the Actors, and Ac|complices!
How many People have they in&s;lav'd!
What Mi&s;eries and Calamities have they not brought

have they open'd! What Rivers of Blood have they
pour'd out! How many Lives have they taken away
after &s;uch a manner as might render 'em yet more
mi&s;erable in the other World! which is a melan|choly
Reflection both in regard of the <HI>Indians</HI> who

Baggage and Provi&s;ions, which they did till they
all died in the way except two hundred. He came
at length into the Province of <HI>Mechuaca,</HI> about forty
Leagues from <HI>Mexico.</HI> The King of this Province
very civilly came out to meet him, and was as offi|cious
to &s;erve him as could be de&s;ir'd; but for his
reward was loaded with Irons, becau&s;e &s;uppos'd to
have a great Trea&s;ure by him; and the better to
<PB N="49" REF="33">
extort great Sums from him, he was made to &s;uffer
a great many Torments. His Hands being tied to
a Stake, and his Legs &s;tretch'd out, they drop'd
burning Pitch on 'em, and ba&s;ted his Body with
boiling Oil from time to time, that his Skin might
be gradually roa&s;ted. Over again&s;t him &s;tood a fu|rious
Souldier with a Bow &s;hooting Arrows into his
Brea&s;t: Another let loo&s;e hungry Dogs to bite and
tear him in every part; all the&s;e Tortures were to
make him confe&s;s where he had hid his Gold: And
the&s;e Cruelties would have been continued longer
if a Franci&s;can Frier had not happen'd to come and
re&s;cue him out of their hands; however he could
not &s;ave his Life, for he expir'd &s;oon after. Many
<HI>Caciques</HI> and great Men of this Province were put to
death after this manner, to make 'em confe&s;s where
they had hid their Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>About this time there arriv'd another Per&s;on in
this Country, who was more greedy of Money, than
&s;olicitous about the Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
He happen'd to find &s;ome of their Idols which they
had hid, (for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would very &s;eldom give
them&s;elves the trouble to inform the&s;e Idolaters of
the True God) Upon this he impri&s;on'd the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable Per&s;ons in the Nation, till they &s;hould
di&s;cover to him where they had put their Idols, be|cau&s;e
he &s;uppos'd theirs were made either of Gold
or Silver; but he fail'd in his Expectation: however
to mend the matter, he impos'd great Sums on the
<HI>Indians,</HI> which they were to pay for the redemption
of their Idols, that they might wor&s;hip 'em after
their wonted manner. The&s;e are the Improvements
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been making in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and this is their Zeal for the Glory of God and Re|ligion.</P>
<P>After this Tyrant had run through the whole
Province of <HI>Mechuaca,</HI> and pillaged it, he came to
<PB N="50" REF="34">
<HI>Xali&s;quo,</HI> a Country very populous and fruitful, and
the mo&s;t famous in all <HI>America;</HI> there are Towns
in it of &s;even Leagues in length. The&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> as
the others had done before, came out to meet him
with great expre&s;&s;ions of Joy; but he &s;oon left up|on
'em the marks of his Cruelty, which he had cul|tivated
by long Experience. The noble Pre&s;ents
made this Tiger could not mollify him. His de&s;ign
was to heap together a great quantity of Gold, this
was the only Idol he ador'd; and all means were in|different
to him, &s;o he could but attain his end.
He &s;et fire to all the Cities through which he pa&s;s'd,
and de&s;troy'd 'em to the very Foundation. He kept
tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Dignity pri&s;oners, after he had
inflicted divers kinds of Torments on 'em. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> loaded all the <HI>Indians</HI> they could take here
with Chains, which was a great number. The Soul|diers
made Women big with Child carry their Bag|gage,
till they fainted and &s;unk under their Burdens
with hunger and wearine&s;s. Others not able to
carry both the heavy Burdens they gave 'em, and
their Children too, were forc'd to leave the&s;e by the
way, by which means a prodigious number of Chil|dren
peri&s;h'd.</P>
<P>A <HI>Spaniard</HI> attempting to ravi&s;h a Virgin in the
pre&s;ence of her Mother, the Mother did what &s;he
could to hinder him; upon which, to prevent her
from farther oppo&s;ing his bruti&s;h de&s;ign, he drew
his Sword and cut off her Arms, and afterwards
kill'd her Daughter becau&s;e &s;he would by no means
con&s;ent to his filthy De&s;ires, but re&s;i&s;ted him with
a virtuous Indignation and Courage to her la&s;t
breath.</P>
<P>Four thou&s;and and five hundred of the&s;e poor <HI>In|dians</HI>
were branded with a hot Iron by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who mark'd 'em thus for Slaves, tho they were
born free and independent. The very Children,
<PB N="51" REF="34">
as well as tho&s;e that were grown to maturity, &s;uffer'd
this Puni&s;hment and Infamy: They pretended they
had right to make a great number of 'em Slaves,
to defray the Charge of their long Travels; and
that they might lawfully make the&s;e poor Creatures
endure all &s;orts of Torments, to force 'em to de|clare
where they had hid their Gold: Some of 'em
they burnt, others were torn in pieces by hungry
Dogs; they cut off the Feet, Hands, Arms, Tongues,
and &s;ometimes the Heads of others, to terrify the
re&s;t by the&s;e &s;ad Spectacles, that they might oblige
'em the more ea&s;ily to &s;ubmit to Slavery, or to &s;hew
'em the places where they had &s;ecur'd their Trea|&s;ure.
And all the&s;e things were acted with the
knowledg and con&s;ent of the Governor, who would
&s;ometimes order more Blows to be given 'em, when
they were beat or whip'd, to compleat their Mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>Four&s;core Towns and Villages at lea&s;t were burnt
in the Kingdom of <HI>Xali&s;co:</HI> Which tragical &s;ight,
together with all the various Cruelties they &s;uffer'd
every day, &s;o provok'd the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they arm'd
them&s;elves and fell upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and kill'd
&s;ome of 'em: after which Expedition they fled up
into the Mountains, but at length were ma&s;&s;acred in
this place of Refuge by other <HI>Spaniards</HI> who made
Excur&s;ions through the&s;e Provinces to lay 'em wa&s;te.
They put all of 'em to the Sword who made any
offer to defend them&s;elves, &s;o that this place became
a horrible &s;cene of Blood: And there is &s;carce any
Remnant of this once numerous People left. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were certainly blinded, harden'd and aban|don'd
by the Almighty, that they made no Reflection
on the Laws of God or Men, which all forbid the
exerci&s;e of &s;uch Violence as they have been guilty
of in <HI>America.</HI> They had no ju&s;t occa&s;ion given 'em
to drive the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Provinces from
<PB N="52" REF="35">
their Native Country by force of Arms, and to
ma&s;&s;acre 'em &s;o barbarou&s;ly: they did not con&s;ider
how unju&s;t and criminal the&s;e Outrages were, and
how contrary it was to all the Laws of Nations, for
them to treat tho&s;e who had never injur'd 'em with
&s;o much Cruelty. They pretend the Wars they
have made again&s;t the&s;e People are ju&s;t and lawful;
that God hath left 'em to their Mercy, and that
they have right to make &s;uch Conque&s;ts as the&s;e,
and to de&s;troy all the&s;e Nations: So that it &s;eems
they would fain make God him&s;elf Partner with 'em
in their Tyranny and Wickedne&s;s; and one may
well apply the words of the Prophet <HI>Zechariah</HI> to
'em: <HI>Feed the flock of the &s;laughter; who&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors
&s;lay them, and hold them&s;elves not guilty: and they that
&s;ell them &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, for I am rich; and
their own Shepherds pity them not.</HI> Chap. 11. 4, 5.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Yucatan.</HEAD>
<P>A Very profligate Per&s;on who had neither Ho|nour
nor Con&s;cience, was made Governor of
the Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan</HI> in the year 1526; which
Dignity he procur'd by his Lies and Artifices, and
the fal&s;e accounts of Matters which he &s;ent to the
King of <HI>Spain.</HI> A method which other Tyrants
have hitherto likewi&s;e follow'd to obtain places of
Tru&s;t: For under the umbrage of the Title of Go|vernor,
which &s;eems to give &s;ome Dignity and Au|thority
to all they do, they take the liberty to ex|erci&s;e
their Robberies and Violences with Impunity.
The Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan</HI> contain'd a prodigious
number of People; the Air of this Country is very
temperate and plea&s;ant: it has great plenty of
Fruits, and all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; it exceeds
<PB N="53" REF="35">
<HI>Mexico</HI> it &s;elf in Fertility: There is more Wax and
Honey found in this than in any other part of <HI>America</HI>
that has been yet di&s;cover'd. This Kingdom is 300
Leagues in compa&s;s. The Inhabitants of it are more
polite, more civiliz'd, and better di&s;ciplin'd in Morals,
and in what belongs to the good order of Societies,
than the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians.</HI> There is a remarkable
Prudence and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Mind in them, which is not
to be found in others. The&s;e natural Endowments
without doubt ought to have encouraged Chri&s;tians
to take the pains to in&s;truct 'em in the knowledg of
the true God; and they &s;eem'd to have no &s;mall
di&s;po&s;ition to receive the Maxims of the Catholick
Religion. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> might have built great and
flouri&s;hing Cities in &s;o plea&s;ant and commodious a
Country, where they might have liv'd in the mid&s;t
of Plea&s;ure and Plenty, as it were in another Earth|ly
Paradi&s;e: but their Stupidity, their Avarice, and
the enormous Crimes they have committed in <HI>Ameri|ca</HI>
have render'd 'em unworthy of the&s;e Advantages.
They attack'd the&s;e poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who liv'd in pro|found
Peace and Security, with the utmo&s;t Violence
of a cruel War, and ma&s;&s;acred a prodigious num|ber
of 'em, tho the number of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was
but three hundred. This Country produces no
Gold; if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could have found any Mines
there, they would have condemn'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to
'em, who mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd with Hunger and Hard|&s;hip.
The&s;e covetous Wretches e&s;teem'd Gold
more than Souls, which were purchas'd by the Blood
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they made Slaves of tho&s;e whom
they &s;av'd alive, and fill'd the Ships they had brought
to the Coa&s;ts of this Kingdom with 'em, and &s;o ex|chang'd
'em for Wine, Oil, Vinegar, &s;alt Pork,
Hor&s;es, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries. They would give
fifty or a hundred of the hand&s;ome&s;t young Girls
for a mea&s;ure of Wine, Oil or Vinegar, and would
<PB N="54" REF="36">
&s;ell a hundred or two of lu&s;ty well-made young Men
at the &s;ame rate. They &s;wop'd a Prince's Son for
a Chee&s;e, and a hundred Per&s;ons of Eminency for a
Hor&s;e. They continued in this Country till they
heard of the Riches of <HI>Peru,</HI> the News of which
made 'em leave it immediately, and thus their Per|&s;ecutions
ended in the Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan.</HI> How|ever,
before they went they committed all the Ex|ce&s;&s;es
and Di&s;orders that can be imagin'd again&s;t
both God and Men: &s;o that tho&s;e three hundred
Leagues of one of the fine&s;t Countries in the World,
that was very rich and full of People before their
arrival, were in a little time reduc'd to a va&s;t
De&s;ert.</P>
<P>'Tis not ea&s;y to believe the Account of all the
villanous Actions they committed in this Kingdom:
I'll recite but two or three particular Facts. They
had prepar'd fierce Dogs which they kept hungry
to go a hunting after the poor <HI>Indians;</HI> as they were
hunting they lighted on a Woman that was &s;ick,
who not being in a condition to fly to avoid being
devour'd of the Dogs, hang'd her &s;elf, after &s;he had
hang'd a Child &s;he had with her of a year old; the
Dogs pre&s;ently camt to her, and began to devour
her: but a certain Frier that was happily there
perceiving the Child not to be yet quite dead, bap|tiz'd it.</P>
<P>When they quitted this Kingdom, they invited
the Son of one of the Princes of the Country to
accompany 'em, who &s;hew'd a great unwillingne&s;s to
abandon his Country to follow 'em, on which they
threatned to cut him in quarters if he did not con|&s;ent
to their de&s;ire. The Child &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in
the &s;ame mind, one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> drew his Sword
and cut off both his Ears: This ill Treatment how|ever
could not make him alter his purpo&s;e, upon
which this Brute cut off his No&s;e and Lips, and
<PB N="55" REF="36">
laugh'd while he was committing this barbarous
Action.</P>
<P>Another brag'd that he had got many Indian
Women with Child, that he might &s;ell 'em for the
more Money. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been &s;o in|human
as to give Infants to their Hounds when they
were hungry: they would take the&s;e poor Babes by
the two Legs, and violently tear 'em a&s;under into
two pieces, and then feed their Dogs with 'em,
They were left of God to &s;uch a reprobate mind,
that they made no more account of human Crea|tures,
that were ran&s;om'd by the Blood of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, than of Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over an infinite number of other unheard
of Cruelties, which &s;urpa&s;s all Imagination. When
the&s;e covetous and ambitious Tyrants left the King|dom
of <HI>Yucatan</HI> to go in &s;earch after the greater
Riches of <HI>Peru,</HI> four Franci&s;can Friers came thither
to comfort the&s;e mi&s;erable People, and to endeavour
by their preaching to bring tho&s;e that had e&s;cap'd
the fury of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the knowledg of the true
God. The &s;ame Friers were very earne&s;tly &s;oli|cited
by many other <HI>Indians</HI> to come into their
Country likewi&s;e to teach 'em the Maxims of their
Religion. They a&s;&s;embled in great companies to
inform them&s;elves what &s;ort of Men the&s;e Religious.
Per&s;ons were, who call'd one another <HI>Father</HI> and
<HI>Brother,</HI> to inquire into their true de&s;igns, and to know
wherein they differ'd from other <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
had exercis'd &s;o much Cruelty over all the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI>
They were willing to entertain 'em on con|dition
they would come alone to in&s;truct 'em, with|out
any other <HI>Spaniards</HI> to attend 'em; which the
Friers promis'd very readily, a&s;&s;uring 'em they would
not offer 'em the lea&s;t Injury. The Governor of
<HI>New Spain</HI> likewi&s;e now order'd 'em to promi&s;e the
<HI>Indians,</HI> that they &s;hould be treated more kindly
<PB N="56" REF="37">
for the time to come, and &s;hould find no farther oc|ca&s;ion
to complain of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Severity. Thus
the&s;e Religious Men began to preach the Go&s;pel of
Chri&s;t with a great deal of Zeal, and inform'd the&s;e
People moreover of the good Intentions of the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> towards 'em; &s;o that in about forty days
time, they brought all their Idols to throw 'em in
the fire: they as readily brought their Children,
whom they bring up with a great deal of tenderne&s;s
and fondne&s;s, to be in&s;tructed; and built both Hou&s;es
and Churches for the&s;e Friers with all the Affection
and Forwardne&s;s imaginable. All the &s;everal Pro|vinces
&s;trove with great Emulation for their Com|pany,
their Zeal was &s;o great for the new Religion
they preach'd to 'em. So that what the Governors
could never obtain of the <HI>Indians</HI> in many years,
the&s;e Friers accompli&s;h'd in a very little time: for
the Princes and Great Men of the&s;e Provinces, at
the head of their People in a General A&s;&s;embly,
voluntarily &s;ubmitted to the Government of the
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whom they acknowledg'd for their
Soveraign, and put them&s;elves under his Protection;
as may be &s;een by the account the&s;e Friers &s;ent into
<HI>Spain</HI> &s;ign'd with their own hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e pious Men were tran&s;ported with Joy to
find a door open'd to 'em to preach the Go&s;pel in
the&s;e va&s;t Provinces, to tho&s;e that had e&s;cap'd the
Barbarity of the &s;everal Governors, who had ma&s;&s;a|cred
&s;uch prodigious numbers. About this time
there came into the&s;e parts eighteen Spani&s;h Troo|pers
with twelve foot Souldiers, who brought with
them abundance of Indian Idols which they had
taken out of other Provinces; the Commander of
the&s;e Souldiers &s;ent for one of the principal Chiefs of
the Nation, and commanded him to take the&s;e Idols
and di&s;tribute 'em throughout the Country, and to
bring him Indian Men and Women in exchange for
<PB N="57" REF="37">
'em, threatning him with a &s;evere War if he re|fus'd
to obey him. This Prince was &s;o terrified
with the&s;e Menaces, that he carried away all the&s;e
Idols, and di&s;pos'd 'em in the &s;everal Cities of his
Province, requiring the People in the name of this
Spani&s;h Captain to wor&s;hip the&s;e fal&s;e Gods, and to
render 'em all the Honour and Service they were
formerly wont to do. To recompen&s;e this Action
they gave him liberty to make as many Slaves as he
pleas'd. The <HI>Indians,</HI> frighted with the threatnings
that were made 'em, deliver'd up their own Children;
he that had two gave one, and he that had three
gave two. This was the Event of this impious
Traffick, the <HI>Cacyque</HI> being forced to obey the Or|ders
of the Spani&s;h Captain. One of the&s;e ungodly
Wretches, who&s;e name was <HI>John Garcia,</HI> being taken
dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, and ready to expire, bethought
him&s;elf that he had a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e
Idols under his Bed; and therefore order'd an In|dian
Woman that he kept to &s;ell 'em, telling her &s;he
might make a good market of 'em, the matter of
which being very valuable, he told her every Image
was at lea&s;t fairly worth an Indian in exchange.
This was the <HI>Spaniards</HI> la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament,
and the&s;e were the marks he gave of the pious di&s;|po&s;ition
of his Mind, and in the mid&s;t of &s;uch Cares
as the&s;e he gave up the Gho&s;t. By this Story it may
ea&s;ily be conjectur'd what good Examples the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
&s;et before the <HI>Indians,</HI> and what progre&s;s the
Catholick Religion is likely to make among the&s;e
People; who being Eye-witne&s;&s;es of &s;uch Actions as
the&s;e, ea&s;ily perceive that the <HI>Europeans</HI> have &s;o
little &s;entiment of Religion, that they don't much
care whether poor Infidels be reduc'd to pay the true
God that Wor&s;hip and Honour they owe him, or
not. It can hardly be &s;aid that <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Crime,
who caus'd two Golden Calves to be ca&s;t, and ob|lig'd
<PB N="58" REF="38">
his Subjects to wor&s;hip 'em, is more hainous
than that of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who drive &s;uch an abo|minable
trade with Idols, and occa&s;ion &s;o much
&s;candal by this &s;hameful kind of Traffick. This is
the manner of their Conduct and Behaviour in the
new World. They &s;acrifice every thing to their
dete&s;table Avarice, and &s;ell Chri&s;t Je&s;us him&s;elf for
Gold. They are every day renouncing him, and
di&s;honouring his Religion by the many infamous
Crimes of which they are guilty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;till continue to
ruin their Country, notwith&s;tanding all the expre&s;s
Promi&s;es the Friers had made 'em that they would
ab&s;tain for the future from their wonted Robberies;
and that in&s;tead of mending their own Lives, they
brought Idols even from other Countries to expo&s;e
to &s;ale among them, who had voluntarily re&s;ign'd
their own to the Friers to be committed to the
Flames, being re&s;olv'd to wor&s;hip but one God in
their Country for time to come: Seeing all this
(I &s;ay) they were extremely enrag'd at the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
and no le&s;s provok'd again&s;t the Friers, whom
they acco&s;ted after this manner. <HI>Why</HI> (&s;ay they)
<HI>have you deceiv'd us thus by your fal&s;e Promi&s;es? Did
not you a&s;&s;ure us the</HI> Spaniards <HI>&s;hould no more invade
and oppre&s;s us? Why have you burnt our Gods, to bring
us &s;trange Gods out of other Countries? Are the&s;e better
or mightier than our own?</HI> The poor Friers endeavor'd
to appea&s;e 'em as well as they could, tho they &s;carce
knew how to an&s;wer their Complaints, having no
good Rea&s;ons to offer to excu&s;e the matter. How|ever
they applied them&s;elves to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> re|proach'd
'em for having &s;o exceedingly &s;candaliz'd
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and conjur'd 'em to leave the Country,
which they ab&s;olutely refus'd to do; and which was
&s;till more vile and unworthy, they per&s;waded the
<HI>Indians</HI> that they had not come into their Country
<PB N="59" REF="38">
but at the reque&s;t of the&s;e Friers: Which pretence
had the &s;ucce&s;s they de&s;ired; for the <HI>Indians</HI> giving
credit to the&s;e Stories, re&s;olv'd to kill the poor
Friers; but &s;ome of 'em giving 'em notice of the
De&s;ign, they made their e&s;cape in the night. After
they were gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiv'd they were im|pos'd
on, and receiv'd full information of the Malice
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the ba&s;e trick they had play'd
'em, and therefore di&s;patch'd a Me&s;&s;age to the Friers
to entreat 'em to return, and forgive the fault they
had committed, a&s;&s;uring 'em they heartily repented
of their Ingratitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e pious Men that were devoted to the Ser|vice
of God, and animated with an ardent Zeal for
the Salvation of Souls, confiding in the Prote&s;ta|tions
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> return'd to 'em according to
their reque&s;t, and were receiv'd as if they had been
Angels come down from Heaven: they continued
three or four Months among 'em, receiving abun|dance
of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s from 'em. The <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
who &s;till refus'd to quit the Country, tho
the Vice-roy had expre&s;ly order'd 'em &s;o to do, and
had us'd all his Authority to oblige 'em to it, were
declar'd Rebels and Traitors; however this did not
hinder 'em from continuing their Rapine and In&s;o|lence.
And tho the Friers were &s;atisfied they would
not always e&s;cape with Impunity, yet they fear'd it
might be a long time before they receiv'd their De|&s;erts;
and con&s;idering moreover that the continual
In&s;ults they made on the <HI>Indians,</HI> depriv'd them of
the liberty of preaching to 'em, upon the whole
they thought meet to re&s;olve to leave this Kingdom,

<HEAD>Of the Province of St. Martha.</HEAD>
<P>THE Province of <HI>St. Martha</HI> was famous for the
rich Golden Mines that are near it, and for
the fruitfulne&s;s of its Soil. The People are nume|rous,
and very skilful in getting Gold out of the
Mines, which ea&s;ily engag'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go thi|ther,
and that in great numbers; they made conti|nual
Excur&s;ions over all this fine Country to ravage
and &s;poil it; they ma&s;&s;acred va&s;t numbers of the
Inhabitants, took away all their Gold, and fill'd their
Ships, which &s;erv'd 'em for Magazines, with the Booty.
They &s;oon laid wa&s;te this flouri&s;hing Province by
the Robberies and Villanies they committed: they
did the greate&s;t mi&s;chief upon the Sea-coa&s;ts, but
they &s;oon after pierc'd higher up into the Country,
where they endeavour'd to make a Settlement. The
Country being rich and fertile, divers Spani&s;h Cap|tains
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively invaded it with their Troops, and
the la&s;t was &s;till more cruel and inhuman than his
Predece&s;&s;or. They &s;eem'd ambitious to outvie one
another in the Enormity of their Crimes and Villa|nies.
In the year 1520, a Spani&s;h General attended
with a great many Souldiers enter'd into this Pro|vince
with a re&s;olution of ruining it entirely. He
continued there for &s;even years together, and carried
<PB N="61" REF="39">
away an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure with him; at la&s;t he
was condemn'd to be bani&s;h'd, and dyed in his
Exile without &s;hewing the lea&s;t token of Repen|tance.
Tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him went on to ma&s;|&s;acre
tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that he and other Tyrants had
&s;pared; they made both the common People, and
the Nobility of this Province &s;uffer mo&s;t horrible
Torments, to oblige 'em by the violence of their
pain to di&s;cover their Gold: they laid this Coun|try
wa&s;te for above 40 Leagues, not leaving one
&s;oul alive; tho this Province was well &s;tock'd with
Inhabitants before their arrival.</P>
<P><HI>To give a particular Relation of all the Extrava|gances,
Ma&s;&s;acres and De&s;olations, of all the Impie|ties
and Villanies committed by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in this
Province again&s;t God, again&s;t the King, and again&s;t
the innocent</HI> Indians, <HI>would require a large Hi&s;to|ry:
I mu&s;t therefore content my &s;elf to pa&s;s over
many Circum&s;tances after a cur&s;ory manner. The
Bi&s;hop of this Province, writing to the King of</HI>
Spain <HI>in the year 1541, among other things thus
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</HI> Great Sir, To redre&s;s the Grievances
of this Province, it ought to be deliver'd from the Ty|ranny
of tho&s;e that ravage it, and committed to the
Care of Per&s;ons of Integrity, who will treat the Inha|bitants
with more kindne&s;s and humanity; for if it be
left to the mercy of the Governours, who commit all &s;orts
of Outrages with impunity, 'twill be de&s;troy'd in a very
little time. <HI>The &s;ame Bi&s;hop farther adds in his Let|ter:</HI>
The ill Conduct of the Governours may well engage
your Maje&s;ty to deprive 'em ab&s;olutely of their Places,
to relieve the&s;e Provinces; and if this cour&s;e be not
taken, the di&s;ea&s;e will be incurable. I am nece&s;&s;itated
to let your Maje&s;ty know, that the Spaniards who
come into this New World, live here rather like Devils
than Chri&s;tians; they neither &s;erve God nor the King;
they violate all the Laws of God and Men with Impuni|ty.
<PB N="62" REF="40">
Nothing can be a greater hindrance to the Conver&s;i|on
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> than the ill Treatment and Per&s;ecu|tion
they make 'em &s;uffer continually. The&s;e People na|turally
love peace and quietne&s;s; but the barbarous u&s;age
they meet with from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in&s;pires 'em with horror
and indignation again&s;t all Chri&s;tians, whom they there|fore
call in their Language <HI>Yares,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Devils.</HI>
Nor is it without rea&s;on that they appear &s;o odious and
abominable to the&s;e poor Creatures, &s;ince the Actions
they &s;ee 'em commit, are more like tho&s;e of Devils, than
of rea&s;onable Creatures, or Chri&s;tians. For while the
<HI>Indians</HI> &s;ee the Officers as well as Souldiers commit &s;uch
dete&s;table Crimes; they believe the Laws of Chri&s;tianity
authorize the&s;e inhuman Actions, and that neither our
God nor our King forbids 'em. 'Tis to no purpo&s;e to
pretend to undeceive 'em, and remove the&s;e Prejudices,
as the Ca&s;e &s;tands; 'tis but only to expo&s;e the Laws and
Religion of Chri&s;t the more to the Contempt of the&s;e Ido|laters.
The <HI>Indians</HI> now begin to defend them&s;elves from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by force of Arms; and choo&s;e rather to
peri&s;h together at once than to &s;uffer a thou&s;and deaths by
the Cruelty of the&s;e unmerciful Men. Your Maje&s;ty has
more Servants in this New World than you imagine;
for there are none who bear Arms in the&s;e va&s;t Coun|tries,
and make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to plunder, kill, and
burn, but give out that they are employ'd here in your
Maje&s;ty's bu&s;ine&s;s, and endeavour to per&s;wade the World
that 'tis by your Maje&s;ty's Order, and for your Interest,
that they do all this Mi&s;chief to the <HI>Indians:</HI> tho the
Truth is, they u&s;e 'em after this violent manner, only
to enrich them&s;elves by plundering 'em of all they have.
It &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for your Maje&s;ty to &s;top the
Cour&s;e of the&s;e Robbers by &s;ome Exemplary Puni&s;hment;
and that your Maje&s;ty declare you will have none of
their Services, who &s;o highly di&s;honour God and Religion.</P>
<P>Thus far the Letter which the Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Mar|tha</HI>
wrote to his Catholick Maje&s;ty: By which it
<PB N="63" REF="40">
may be conjectur'd how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have abus'd
the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> They in deri&s;ion and &s;corn call
tho&s;e the Warlike <HI>Indians,</HI> that fly into the Moun|tains
to &s;ave their Lives. And when they force
the&s;e mi&s;erable People, to travel in rough and dif|cult
ways, &s;weating under the great Burdens
they oblige 'em to carry, not content with having
overloaded 'em, they aggravate their mi&s;ery by
beating 'em unmercifully, and brui&s;ing their Fa|ces
with the pommels of their Swords, till the poor
Wretches driven to de&s;pair with all this Op|pre&s;&s;ion,
often cry out, <HI>I can hold out no longer; kill
me out-right; put an end to my Mi&s;eries by a &s;peedy
Death.</HI> And many deep &s;ighs accompany the&s;e
Expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;ometimes they are &s;carce able

<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made horrible Ravage and

Gulf of <HI>Venecuela,</HI> which is the &s;pace of above

I purpo&s;ely omit a great many Di&s;orders which
they committed along this Coa&s;t, being willing to

this Country in the year 1510, and immediate|ly
commanded the <HI>Indians</HI> to come to him, pretend|ing
he was come to live peaceably with them in
the I&s;land; who receiv'd him and his Company
with as great Te&s;timonies of kindne&s;s, as if they

the Country as well as the common People all wait|ed
on 'em with abundance of alacrity and joy; they
every day brought 'em a quantity of Provi&s;ions &s;uffi|cient
for a much greater number of men: For the
<HI>Indians</HI> are very much given to ho&s;pitality, and rea|dily
&s;upply Strangers with all the Nece&s;&s;aries they

make 'em build a va&s;t hou&s;e, that all the <HI>Indians</HI>
might lodg together in the &s;ame place; they us'd
this Artifice to catch 'em in the &s;nare they were

'em with their naked Swords, threatning to cut
their Throats, if they made any &s;tir or di&s;turbance;

as they do, to &s;uch a mi&s;erable &s;tate of bondage. It
was re&s;olv'd among the Dominican Friers to &s;end
&s;ome of their Order, to di&s;play the Light of the
Go&s;pel among the <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd in the gro&s;s dark|ne&s;s

They fir&s;t &s;ent one that was a Licentiate in
Divinity, of great reputation for his Piety and Vir|tue,
who took with him a Lay-brother: they both
went through this Country to &s;eek a commodious
place for the building of a Mona&s;try; and conferr'd
with &s;ome of the Inhabitants what mea&s;ures to take
to &s;ucceed in this de&s;ign. When the other Friers were
arriv'd, the <HI>Indians</HI> receiv'd 'em as if they had been
Me&s;&s;engers &s;ent from Heaven; they manife&s;ted abun|dance
of affection to 'em, heard what they &s;aid
with great attention, as far as they were capable of
under&s;tanding them; for the&s;e religious Per&s;ons
not being yet &s;ufficiently acquainted with their
Language, were con&s;train'd to make u&s;e of &s;igns to
expre&s;s their meaning.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Ship that brought the Friers
gone off, but there came another full of Souldiers,
who made u&s;e of Treachery and Artifice, according
to their wicked Cu&s;tom, to &s;eize the Prince of this Na|tion,
unknown to the Friers. This Prince's name was
<HI>Alfon&s;o,</HI> which was given him either by the Friers, or
<PB N="67" REF="43">
&s;ome other <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> take upon 'em
Chri&s;tian Names with a great deal of Joy; and before
they are in&s;tructed in our My&s;teries, very eagerly de|&s;ire
to be baptized. This Prince <HI>Alfon&s;o,</HI> together with
his Prince&s;s, not aware of the Artifices of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and the deceitful trick they had re&s;olv'd to play 'em,
were per&s;waded to go on board one of their Ships,
and many other <HI>Indians</HI> did the like, being all made
to believe there was a great Fea&s;t prepar'd for 'em;
and they needed the le&s;s importunity to entice 'em
into the Ship, becau&s;e they &s;uppos'd the Friers, in
whom they put abundance of Cofidence, had Inte|re&s;t
and Authority enough among the Soldiers to &s;e|cure
'em from all manner of danger: otherwi&s;e
they would not have &s;o ea&s;ily tru&s;ted them&s;elves in
the hands of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The very moment they
enter'd the Ve&s;&s;el, the&s;e perfidious Men &s;et &s;ail, and
carried 'em to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where they &s;old 'em for
Slaves. All the Country was alarm'd at the &s;ad
tidings that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had carried away their
Prince and Prince&s;s; and came in Crowds to &s;eek
the Friers, who narrowly e&s;cap'd being kill'd by 'em.
The&s;e good men were extreamly griev'd at the
treachery us'd with the&s;e poor People; and would
rather have died than &s;uffer'd the&s;e Outrages to
be on all occa&s;ions committed again&s;t 'em, if they
could have prevented 'em, becau&s;e the&s;e were the
great ob&s;tacles that hinder'd 'em from embracing the
Catholick Religion. However, the <HI>Indians</HI> were ap|peas'd
by the promi&s;es the Friers made 'em, that
they would write by the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el that &s;hould
go to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> to procure their Prince and Prin|ce&s;s
to be &s;ent back. Accordingly a Ve&s;&s;el being
in a little time prepar'd for this Voyage, they
made u&s;e of the opportunity to write to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI>
to engage the&s;e Robbers to re&s;tore their Prey, which
they ob&s;tinately refus'd to do, the Governours of
<PB N="68" REF="44">
that I&s;land having had a &s;hare in the Booty. The&s;e
good Friers who had given their word to the <HI>Indians,</HI>
that their Prince <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> and his Prince&s;s &s;hould be
re&s;tor'd to em in four months, &s;eeing twice four
Months elaps'd without any hope of their return,
were oblig'd to prepare for death; there was now
no way to avoid &s;hedding their blood for the Glory
of Chri&s;t, and in his Service, which Sacrifice they
had offer'd in the ready di&s;po&s;ition of their Minds
to &s;uffer before they came from <HI>Spain:</HI> In &s;hort,
they were ma&s;&s;acred by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who believed
they were Accomplices of the foremention'd Trea|chery;
and thought their &s;u&s;picion well founded,
becau&s;e the Friers had promis'd to redre&s;s their
Grievance in four months time; and yet they &s;aw
the&s;e promi&s;es produc'd no effect: Be&s;ides, the&s;e
Barbarians make no great difference between tho&s;e
religious Men that go to the <HI>Indies</HI> only to in&s;truct
and preach to 'em, and the Spani&s;h Souldiers who
go thither only to enrich them&s;elves by robbing 'em.
However, the&s;e good Fathers were unju&s;tly put to
death; and one may without &s;cruple place 'em in
the Order of Martyrs, and conclude they are now
enjoying God in the glory of Heaven. They obe|diently
re&s;ign'd them&s;elves to go into <HI>America</HI> ac|cording
to the direction of their Superiours, and
had no other intention in their Voyage, but that of
preaching the Chri&s;tian Faith to the&s;e Idolaters,
and of putting 'em in the way of Salvation, with a
re&s;olution to &s;uffer any hard&s;hips, or even death it
&s;elf, in the pro&s;ecution of &s;o pious a De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The cruel Treatment the <HI>Indians</HI> met with from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> occa&s;ioned 'em likewi&s;e to kill two
Dominican Friers about the &s;ame time. There was
in the&s;e Provinces, near the Gulf of <HI>Codera,</HI> a City,
the Prince of which was nam'd <HI>Higuerote;</HI> who was
naturally of a &s;weet and amicable temper, and his
<PB N="69" REF="44">
Subjects civil and complai&s;ant: when the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
came fir&s;t a&s;hore in his Country, the Inhabitants treat|ed
'em with abundance of Kindne&s;s; they &s;upplied
'em with Provi&s;ions and Stores in great plenty;
and omitted nothing they were capable of doing
to refre&s;h and recruit 'em after the fatigues and
troubles of their Voyage. This Prince had &s;av'd
the lives of a great many <HI>Europeans,</HI> who had ex|ercis'd
their Cruelty and Oppre&s;&s;ion in other Pro|vinces,
when they came to his Coa&s;ts half dead with
hunger and wearine&s;s; and after he had recruited
'em with his good Entertainment, &s;ent 'em &s;afe and
in a good &s;tate of health to the I&s;le of <HI>Pearls,</HI> which
was the ordinary Re&s;idence of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho
he might have &s;ecurely kill'd 'em all, without being
ever &s;u&s;pected of the fact. Upon this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
were &s;o well per&s;waded of <HI>Higuerote</HI>'s good inclina|tion
toward 'em, that they took his hou&s;e for their
home, and were as kindly entertain'd in it as they
could expect to be in their own. While this Coun|try
thus enjoy'd a profound Peace, a Spani&s;h Captain
coming a&s;hore there, invited divers of the Inhabitants
to come on board his Ve&s;&s;el; which they often did,
from the entire confidence they had in the repeated
Promi&s;es the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made 'em that they would
do 'em no injury: At length when many of 'em
were got into the Ship, the Captain gave a Sig|nal
to put out to Sea, and &s;ail'd directly for the I&s;le
of <HI>St. John,</HI> where he &s;old all the poor Creatures,
whom he had thus perfidiou&s;ly &s;urpriz'd. I &s;oon
after arriv'd in the &s;ame I&s;land, where I &s;aw this
Robber, and had a particular account given me of
the Circum&s;tances of this villanous Action; and it
&s;eems, to compleat the Crime, he utterly de&s;troy'd
this Prince's City. The&s;e things were not well re|&s;ented
by the re&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that us'd to crui&s;e
up and down the neighbouring Coa&s;ts to pillage 'em;
<PB N="70" REF="45">
for they could not but abhor the Action of this Cap|tain,
that he &s;hould by &s;o infamous a piece of Trea|chery
abu&s;e this Indian Chief, who had done 'em &s;o
many good Offices from time to time, and was wont
to entertain 'em as if they had been his own Chil|dren.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> took away above two Millions of
Men from the Coa&s;ts of the&s;e Provinces, and tran&s;|ported
'em into the I&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> and <HI>St. John,</HI>
where the greate&s;t part peri&s;h'd in the Mines, or
by other Hard&s;hips which they made 'em &s;uffer. It
would produce Compa&s;&s;ion in the harde&s;t Hearts,
to &s;ee the&s;e Coa&s;ts that were once &s;o full of People
now ab&s;olutely de&s;ert. It has been ob&s;erv'd by ma|ny
Trials, that one third part of the Slaves which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take on board their Ve&s;&s;els die by the
way, be&s;ides tho&s;e they kill when they &s;earch their
Hou&s;es to take the&s;e poor Wretches away. The
end the <HI>Spaniards</HI> propo&s;e to them&s;elves, which is
to get Riches at any rate in the world, induces 'em
to commit all this Violence; they carry away great
numbers of Slaves, to produce con&s;iderable Sums of
Mony, and yet take but a &s;mall quantity of Provi|&s;ions
in their Ships to maintain all the&s;e People, for
fear of being at too great a charge in tran&s;porting
'em; nay &s;ometimes they have &s;carce enough for the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that man the Ship: &s;o that many of the
<HI>Indians</HI> peri&s;h mi&s;erably with Hunger and Thir&s;t;
and &s;ometimes they ca&s;t the greate&s;t part of 'em
over board, to pre&s;erve the re&s;t. A certain Pilot
told me, that in a Voyage he once made from
the <HI>Lucay</HI> I&s;lands to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> which is about &s;e|venty
Leagues, he had no need either of a Com|pa&s;s,
or the ob&s;ervation of the Stars to guide his
Ve&s;&s;el; for he a&s;&s;ur'd me the floating Bodies of
the <HI>Indians</HI> that had been thrown into the Sea,
&s;erv'd for his Guide throughout this Pa&s;&s;age, and
<PB N="71" REF="45">
conducted him &s;traight to the port to which he
was bound.</P>
<P>To &s;ee the <HI>Indians</HI> arrive in any I&s;land where they
de&s;ign to &s;ell 'em, can't but excite Compa&s;&s;ion and
Trouble in every Mind that is not dive&s;ted of all
Sentiments of Humanity: To &s;ee a great number
of Men. Women and Children &s;tark naked, and &s;o
worn out with Hunger and Hard&s;hip, that many of
'em can &s;carce &s;tand, and others fall down with Faint|ne&s;s;
and to &s;ee 'em divided into &s;everal Companies
like Sheep, Husbands &s;eparated from their Wives,
and Children from their Parents; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are wont to divide 'em by ten or twenty in a Com|pany,
and then to ca&s;t Lots which &s;hare each Man
&s;hall have. This is the trade of the&s;e Pirats, who
arm and fit out Ve&s;&s;els on purpo&s;e to carry away
the&s;e poor Wretches from their own Hou&s;es, to in|rich
them&s;elves by &s;elling 'em for Slaves. When a
<HI>Spaniard</HI> happens to have an old or &s;ick Man fall to
his &s;hare among the re&s;t, he'll complain of &s;uch a
Lot, and &s;ay to his Companions, <HI>Why d'ye give me
this old Fellow that's good for nothing? he is not worth his
keeping: What &s;hall I do with this &s;ick Slave, that will
only be a charge to me, and can do me no Service?</HI> 'Tis
ea&s;y to &s;ee by all this how little account they make
of the&s;e People, and what little regard they have
to the Rules of Chri&s;tian Charity; 'tis too evident
they neither have any love to God, nor to their
Neighbour, tho on the&s;e two (as our Saviour &s;ays)
both the Law and the Prophets depend.</P>
<P>The dete&s;table Cruelty and Tyranny of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in in&s;naring and &s;eizing the&s;e poor <HI>Indians,</HI>
when they go in que&s;t of 'em to in&s;lave 'em, and
employ 'em in fi&s;hing for Pearls, is &s;carce to be ima|gin'd.
The Torments they make the&s;e unfortunate
People endure, can &s;carce be compar'd to any le&s;s
than tho&s;e of Hell. What they &s;uffer in the Gold
<PB N="72" REF="46">
Mines, tho very terrible, yet is far inferior to that
we are now relating. They make 'em dive in the
Sea five or &s;ix fathom under water (where they are
forc'd to hold their Breath) to take up Mother of
Pearl; and when they come up to the &s;urface of the
Water with Nets full of tho&s;e Shells, to get a little
Breath, if they keep above water &s;omething longer
than ordinary to refre&s;h them&s;elves a little, a mer|cile&s;s
<HI>Spaniard</HI> who attends with a Boat, beats and
abu&s;es 'em without mea&s;ure, and often takes 'em by
the hair of the head, to force 'em again under
water, to continue their fi&s;hing. They feed 'em
with a little Fi&s;h and a piece of dry hungry Bread,
and don't give 'em a Belly full of that neither; they
have no other Bed than the hard ground on which
they make 'em &s;leep in their Chains, for fear they
&s;hould run away. They are often drown'd in fi&s;hing
thus for Pearl, or el&s;e devour'd by a &s;ort of Sea|mon&s;ters,
that will &s;wallow a Man whole, &s;o that
they hear no more of 'em.</P>
<P>'Tis no hard matter to perceive by what has been
&s;aid, that the Precept of Chri&s;tian Charity is ill ob|&s;erv'd
in this kind of fi&s;hing, &s;eeing the&s;e poor
Slaves are expos'd to imminent danger of peri&s;hing
both in Soul and Body. The Avarice of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
who mind nothing but Gain, is &s;uch, that
they &s;carce take any care to in&s;truct their Slaves,
and to fortify 'em by communicating the Sacraments
to 'em. They oppre&s;s 'em with &s;o much Labour
and Fatigue, that they die in a little time; and 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible Men &s;hould continue long under water
without Re&s;piration, and endure the great Con|&s;traint
they &s;uffer in holding their Breath: The
coldne&s;s of the Water &s;ometimes makes 'em vomit
Blood; and they &s;oon die, partly by having their
Stomachs &s;o violently pre&s;s'd by long holding of
their Breath under water, and partly by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="73" REF="46">
Cold they endure, which cau&s;es that flux of
Blood of which I have ju&s;t now &s;poken. Tho they
have naturally black Hair, the Fatigue they undergo
changes the colour of it; &s;o that it becomes like the
Hair of Sea-wolves. The foam of the Sea &s;ticks &s;o
fa&s;t to their Shoulders, and in &s;uch a manner, that they
look more like Mon&s;ters than Men. By this fi&s;hing
trade the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have de&s;troy'd all the People of
the <HI>Lucay</HI>-I&s;lands, which were the mo&s;t skilful and
experienc'd in this Employment; and the rea&s;on
why one of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> was &s;old for fifty Crowns
or more, and &s;ometimes for a hundred, was be|cau&s;e
they were marvellou&s;ly dextrous at &s;wimming

<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Ven&ccedil;uela.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1526, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> abus'd by the
Artifices of &s;ome ill-de&s;igning People, who made
u&s;e of a thou&s;and fetches and excu&s;es to conceal
from him the great Deva&s;tations the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
made in the new World, to the great prejudice of
the Glory of God, the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the
Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> gave the Government
of the Kingdom of <HI>Ven&ccedil;uela,</HI> which is bigger than
all <HI>Spain,</HI> to &s;everal <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Merchants, with full
Juri&s;diction and Power to do what they pleas'd there,
and to di&s;po&s;e of the Country as they thought
convenient. They accordingly enter'd it with
three hundred Men, and found the People there to
be of a meek, tractable and peaceful Di&s;po&s;ition, as
indeed the <HI>Indians</HI> generally are when left to their
natural Temper, and not enrag'd by the Abu&s;es &s;o
often offer'd 'em. The&s;e were &s;till more bruti&s;h
and cruel than tho&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> of whom we have
been hitherto &s;peaking: They exceeded Tygers,
Wolves and Lions in Barbarity, when they &s;aw
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of this great Kingdom, in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it, and the Juri&s;diction of it entirely put
into their hands: they thought they had ample li|berty
to do there whatever they pleas'd, and that
they might &s;atisfy their Covetou&s;ne&s;s at any rate,
and by all the methods they could imagine, tho
never &s;o unju&s;t. They took no care but how to heap
up va&s;t Trea&s;ures of Gold and Silver; and the abo|minable
<PB N="75" REF="47">
means they us'd to this end, &s;hew'd they
had no regard either to God or their Prince; nay,
they &s;eem'd to have utterly forgotten that them|&s;elves
were Men, having put on &s;uch an inhuman and
&s;avage Fiercene&s;s; or to come yet nearer to their
true Character, they appear'd like &s;o many Devils
in the &s;hape of Men.</P>
<P>They ran through the&s;e rich and plea&s;ant Pro|vinces,
and in&s;tantly laid the Country wa&s;te for forty
Leagues together, wherein were fruitful Vallies of
a prodigious extent, and Towns and Villages &s;tor'd
with great quantities of Gold. The de&s;truction
they made was &s;o general, that &s;carce a Man was
left to carry the News of the Cruelties they ex|erci&s;ed
in this Kingdom to other Provinces: none
but tho&s;e that hid them&s;elves in Caves and Holes of
the Earth, could e&s;cape the Sword of the&s;e furious
and inhuman Creatures. They invented new kinds
of Puni&s;hments wherewith to torment 'em, to force
'em to part with their Gold by di&s;covering the places
where they had hid it: After this manner they
de&s;troy'd three or four Millions of People. The
In&s;tances of three or four Facts will &s;ufficiently di&s;|cover
how the&s;e Brutes behav'd them&s;elves in this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things they did, was to &s;eize him,
whom they look'd upon as the Soveraign Prince of
the whole Kingdom; they loaded him with Irons
to get the more Gold out of him: they endeavour'd
by the Tortures to which they put him, to make
him di&s;cover the places where he had &s;ecur'd his
Trea&s;ures; but he had the good fortune to e&s;cape
their hands, and fly into the Mountains: His Sub|jects
&s;urrounded him, and hid him in the Woods;
but their number was too great to be long conceal'd:
&s;o that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pur&s;ued 'em with Swords in
their hands, and made a dreadful Ma&s;&s;acre among
<PB N="76" REF="48">
'em; others of them they took alive, and &s;old for
Slaves.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had took their King Pri&s;oner,
they were receiv'd in all the&s;e Provinces with &s;ing|ing,
dancing, and all the highe&s;t demon&s;trations of
Joy, as if come to bring Peace and Plenty with 'em
into the Country: They frankly and voluntarily
gave 'em immen&s;e Sums of Gold and Silver; for
which all the Compen&s;ation they had was to be
run through, and cut with Lances and Swords, and
ma&s;&s;acred without pity. One day when they came
out to meet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to do 'em the more ho|nour,
the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Commander having order'd a
great number of 'em to a&s;&s;emble together in a cer|tain
Hou&s;e, cut 'em all in pieces immediately, only
&s;ome of the poor Wretches got upon the Beams to
avoid the fury of the Souldiers; upon which this
Commander caus'd the Hou&s;e to be fir'd, and de|&s;troy'd
them in the Flames. The whole Country
was &s;oon turn'd into a De&s;ert; for all that e&s;cap'd
the Souldiers Rage retir'd into the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> after this pa&s;s'd into a va&s;t Pro|vince
upon the Confines of that of <HI>St. Martha,</HI>
where they found the Natives following their ordi|nary
bu&s;ine&s;s in profound Peace. All the while they
continued here they liv'd at the charge of the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
who &s;erv'd 'em with as much Affection and
Diligence, as if they had ow'd their Lives to 'em:
nay, they bore with their trouble&s;om Humors, and
continually receiv'd ill Treatment from 'em with in|credible
Patience. The <HI>Indians</HI> moreover to qualify
their ill Temper, brought 'em a prodigious quanti|ty
of Gold, and many other things of great value.
Yet the&s;e Tyrants, when upon the point of leaving
'em, in&s;tead of gratefully acknowledging all the
good Offices they had receiv'd of 'em, re&s;olv'd to
put 'em all to the Sword. The <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> General
<PB N="77" REF="48">
(who has &s;ince been &s;uppos'd to be a Heretick, be|cau&s;e
he never went to Ma&s;s him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer'd
others to go) commanded his Men to take all the
<HI>Indians</HI> with their Wives and Children, and put 'em
into &s;ome very large place capable of containing
'em all; and then to declare to 'em that if they had
a mind to redeem their Liberty, with that of their
Wives and Children, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lay down
a certain Sum, which this unju&s;t Governor had tax'd
'em according to his own capricious Humour; and
to urge 'em the more to an&s;wer his Requirement, he
barbarou&s;ly prohibited his Men to give any Victuals
to the&s;e poor Creatures, till each of 'em had paid
the Sum impos'd on him. Many of 'em &s;ent to their
Hou&s;es for the Sum demanded, being willing to do
what they could to redeem their Liberty, and to
have leave to go &s;eek &s;omething to eat: Yet they
were no &s;ooner got out of the Clutches of this co|vetous
Governor, but he in&s;tantly &s;ent Soldiers to
take 'em again, and &s;ubject 'em to the &s;ame Confine|ment
from which they had ran&s;om'd them&s;elves
with &s;o much difficulty: &s;o that they dy'd in this
Captivity with Hunger and Thir&s;t, unle&s;s they &s;pee|dily
bought their Liberty again, which they forc'd
'em to do by this barbarous u&s;age. So that many
of 'em were taken and retaken thus three or four
times, and every time oblig'd to ran&s;om them&s;elves
with great Sums. Tho&s;e that were not able to pay
the Tax laid upon 'em, continued in this cruel Pri&s;on
till they pin'd away with Hunger and Mi&s;ery. Thus
was this opulent Province that abounded with Gold,
made de&s;olate in a very little time. There was one
plea&s;ant and fertile Vale ravag'd by the&s;e Brutes,
which extended no le&s;s than forty Leagues; they
burnt a Town in it con&s;i&s;ting of a thou&s;and Hou&s;es.
After this re&s;olving to advance farther into the
Country to di&s;cover a new way to <HI>Peru,</HI> they made
<PB N="78" REF="49">
u&s;e of a multitude of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Journey, whom
they loaded with Chains, and their Baggage toge|ther:
tho&s;e that fainted under their Burdens with
wearine&s;s, they kill'd upon the &s;pot, cutting of
their heads; and divided the Burdens of them that
died among the Survivors.</P>
<P>If one could exactly de&s;cribe all the Ravage and
Ma&s;&s;acres the <HI>Spaniards</HI> commited in this Province,
together with all the Towns they fir'd, &s;o deplora|ble
a Story would fill every Reader with horror, and
almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;s belief. Many other Tyrants came
afterward into this Province, who follow'd the &s;teps
of the former in &s;earching for Gold and other Trea|&s;ure;
but they found the Country &s;o burnt, pillag'd
and de&s;olate, tho it had heretofore been both very
populous and fertile, that they them&s;elves could
not but &s;tand amaz'd to think what Cruelties the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> had endur'd.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Violences were plainly prov'd by the
Procurator of the Trea&s;ury of the Council of the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The Acts and Proceedings made in
this Affair are yet pre&s;erv'd upon record; yet not
one of the&s;e Tyrants was ever put to death for
the Injuries offer'd the&s;e poor <HI>Indians:</HI> &s;o that all
the Proce&s;s that was made again&s;t 'em prov'd to ve|ry
little purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice that
have been hitherto &s;ent into the <HI>Indies</HI> have regard|ed
nothing but their Intere&s;t; and &s;tudied how to
enrich them&s;elves without taking the trouble to
examin and puni&s;h the Crimes of the&s;e Tyrants,
who did &s;o much mi&s;chief, and committed &s;o many
Outrages on the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> They content them|&s;elves

committed great Crimes, and abus'd the Inhabitants of

Revenues to &s;uch a degree. But when they have
made the&s;e loo&s;e and general Enquiries, they go no
<PB N="79" REF="49">
farther: Whereas more effectual Remedies ought
to be u&s;ed to &s;top the Cour&s;e of all the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs.
There is not &s;o much care taken as to evidence and
verify the&s;e matters; nor do they give their Acts
and Proceedings all the Life and Authority they
ought: for to di&s;charge their Duty faithfully to
God and the King, they &s;hould make &s;uch Tyrants
as the&s;e re&s;tore all the Plunder they have &s;o unju&s;tly
got. And 'twould be no difficult matter to prove
that they carried out of this Kingdom of <HI>Vencuela</HI>
above 3 Millions of Gold, having utterly ruined
the Country for 40 leagues together in the &s;pace of
17 years; for &s;o long they continued &s;poiling this
noble and fruitful Region. They have cheated
the King of above 2 Millions of his Revenues; nor
can they ever be able to repair the damage they
have done this delicious Country, unle&s;s the ma|ny
thou&s;and People they have cruelly murder'd
could be rais'd again from the dead. What I am
now &s;peaking of, only re&s;pects the King's tem|poral
Intere&s;t, which they have &s;o ill manag'd, with|out
&s;aying any thing of their Bla&s;phemies, their

precipitated into Hell, in not &s;uffering the Mi&s;&s;io|naries
to in&s;truct 'em? The&s;e are the Fruits of
their dete&s;table avarice and profanity. As &s;oon as
ever they enter'd this Kingdom, they &s;everal times
loaded divers Ships with great numbers of <HI>Indians,</HI>
whom they carried into the I&s;le of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> and
&s;old for Slaves. Great multitudes of the&s;e poor
Creatures were likewi&s;e carried into <HI>Hi&s;paniola,
Jamaica,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>St. John,</HI> to the number at
lea&s;t of a million of Men. The Royal Council has

<HI>St. Martha;</HI> tho they might have ea&s;ily hinder'd all
this mi&s;chief if they had applied them&s;elves to it.
'Twas the infamous Avarice of the&s;e Tyrants, that
induc'd 'em to take &s;o many <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ell 'em for

<P>When they came into <HI>Florida,</HI> they found it plen|tifully

they immediately began to ca&s;t a Terror through|out
the Country by I know not how many Ma&s;&s;a|cres;
&s;o that the poor <HI>Indians</HI> who had never
known any thing like it, were put into a mighty
Con&s;ternation. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> us'd 'em in&s;tead of
Bea&s;ts of burden to carry their Arms, Uten&s;ils and
Provi&s;ions: yet the Inhabitants of one great Town

with plenty of Provi&s;ions as long as they continued

<HEAD>Of the River de la Plata, or Silver-River.</HEAD>
<P>SEveral Spani&s;h Captains have undertaken Voyages
to the <HI>Silver-River,</HI> &s;ince the year 1502. The
Country upon it is of a va&s;t extent, and contains ma|ny
great Kingdoms and noble Provinces. The In|habitants
are a very rational and civil &s;ort of Peo|ple,
and live at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the
other <HI>Indians;</HI> which render'd it an ea&s;y matter
to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to mole&s;t 'em with impunity, and
to exerci&s;e all their wonted Rapine and Cruelty
among 'em. They every where carry with 'em the
&s;ame de&s;ign of enriching and making them&s;elves
great and powerful at the co&s;t of the&s;e unhappy
People, whom they plunder of their Trea&s;ure, as if
it were the &s;poil of a ju&s;t and lawful War. Wher|ever
they come, they u&s;e the &s;ame ways and means
to compa&s;s their de&s;ign; they torment and kill the
People, pillage and de&s;troy the Country, ruining
whole Nations to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their Gold
and Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="51">
On the Banks of the <HI>Silver-River</HI> they have de|&s;troy'd
divers great Provinces and Kingdoms; and
cut the Throats of multitude of <HI>Indians,</HI> treating
'em with all the Cruelties they could invent: for
when they were at this va&s;t di&s;tance from <HI>Spain,</HI>
they did not much fear the King's Authority; be|lieving
the remotene&s;s of the place where they com|mitted
their Crimes, would &s;ecure 'em from the
danger of &s;uffering for 'em. This hope of impu|nity
made 'em more barbarou&s;ly cruel in this Coun|try
than in others; &s;o that they liv'd here after the
mo&s;t licentious manner imaginable, without the
lea&s;t regard to Law or Ju&s;tice. However &s;ome of
their Actions have been reported to the Council of
the <HI>Indies.</HI> A certain Governor one day command|ed
his Souldiers to enter into a Town, and ma&s;&s;a|cre
all the Inhabitants, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to
give 'em what provi&s;ions they wanted. The Sol|diers
prompted by this Order, and &s;upported by
the Authority of the Governor that &s;ent 'em, kill'd
5000 of the&s;e poor Creatures; who looking on
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as their declared Enemies, were not
willing to tru&s;t 'em, or to have any commerce
with 'em; and therefore hid them&s;elves, not &s;o
much to avoid giving 'em what they as'kd, as to
e&s;cape the points of their Swords. The other <HI>In|dians</HI>
were &s;o terrified by this &s;laughter, that they
readily offer'd them&s;elves in great numbers to &s;erve
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> when they were one
day call'd by the Governour to receive &s;ome orders
from him, I know not by what hap, made &s;ome de|lay
to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before him; upon which
he commanded 'em to be deliver'd up to another
Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> who were their mortal Enemies.
The poor Wretches as &s;oon as they heard this cruel
Sentence, cried out mo&s;t hideou&s;ly, entreating the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> with tears in their Eyes rather to kill 'em
<PB N="84" REF="52">
outright with their Swords and Lances, than to
abandon 'em to the rage of their &s;worn Enemies.
Nor could they by any means be got out of the
hou&s;e were they were; upon which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
hew'd 'em in pieces one after another; while the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> complain'd to 'em of their barbarity, expre&s;|&s;ing
them&s;elves with hearts full of angui&s;h and de&s;pair
after this manner: <HI>We came voluntarily to meet you,

<HEAD>Of the great Kingdoms and Provinces of Peru.</HEAD>
<P>A Spani&s;h Commander with a great number of
Soldiers enter'd the&s;e Kingdoms with the Ti|tle
of Governour; and with a Re&s;olution to heap
up a va&s;t Trea&s;ure in a little time. He had already
given &s;ome proofs of his skill and capacity on the
Continent; and he every day perfected him&s;elf
more and more in the Art of cutting of throats
and pillaging. He was naturally cruel, without
Faith, Honour or Religion; he knew no other
God than Gold or Silver, and therefore gave him|&s;elf
liberty to commit all &s;orts of Crimes, to get the&s;e
Metals any way in the world. He did abundance
of mi&s;chief in the large Provinces of <HI>Peru.</HI> 'Tis
not po&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent to the life what Per&s;ecuti|ons
the Inhabitants of this rich Country underwent;
and what cruel &s;orts of death they were made to
<PB N="85" REF="52">
&s;uffer, to extort their Gold and Silver from 'em.</P>
<P>When this Governour fir&s;t enter'd <HI>Peru,</HI> he rifled
divers Villages, and took away prodigious quantities
of Gold. He then pa&s;s'd into an I&s;land (not far
from this Kingdom) which is very plea&s;ant, fruit|ful
and populous. The Prince of this I&s;land, toge|ther
with the Inhabitants, came out to meet the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
and received 'em with great joy and civility.
But in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, which time the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
continued here, they con&s;um'd all the Corn and
other Provi&s;ions they found in the I&s;land. After this
they di&s;cover'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> had hid &s;ome Corn
under ground, to keep again&s;t a time of &s;carcity, for
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their Wives and Children; which
they were con&s;train'd to leave to the di&s;cretion of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as their own Pro|perty;
and hereby reduc'd the&s;e poor People to the
utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. Soon after this they left the I&s;land,
but fir&s;t kill'd a great many of the People, and car|ried
away the re&s;t with 'em for Slaves. Thus by the
many Cruelties they committed, this I&s;land is quite
depopulated.</P>
<P>From hence they went into the I&s;le of <HI>Tumbala,</HI>
which is &s;ituate near the Continent; here they ma&s;|&s;acred
all the Inhabitants that fell into their hands.
The re&s;t frighted at this cruel &s;laughter, fled every
way they could to avoid 'em; and tho they did this
only to &s;ave their Lives, it was interpreted a Rebel|lion
again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but was only an Ar|tifice
of this Tyrant to entrap the&s;e mi&s;erable Peo|ple,
that he might make 'em &s;urrender to him all
the Gold and Silver they had: which they brought
to him in great quantities, while he &s;till demanded
greater, being re&s;olv'd to leave 'em nothing: And
when he had &s;trip'd 'em of all they had, he told
them he receiv'd 'em into the number of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects, and pretended a great deal of kind|ne&s;s
<PB N="86" REF="53">
to 'em, promi&s;ing he would treat 'em as his
friends, and not do 'em the lea&s;t hurt for the time
to come. This Hypocrite was for plundering the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and terrifying 'em with menaces of the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s di&s;plea&s;ure; but had the Policy not
to receive 'em into the number of this Prince's Va&s;|&s;als,
till he had robb'd 'em of all they had. And
yet the Title of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects did
not &s;ecure 'em for the future from his In&s;ults and
Robberies.</P>
<P>The name of the Soveraign Prince and Empe|ror
of all the&s;e Kingdoms was <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> who
brought with him an innumerable Army of naked
men, who made u&s;e of a ridiculous &s;ort of Wea|pons,
not under&s;tanding the force of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Swords and Lances, and Hor&s;es, with which the&s;e
<HI>Indians</HI> had never been acquainted; he advanc'd his
Troops near the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> crying with a great deal
of courage, <HI>Where are the&s;e</HI> Spaniards? <HI>I'll never leave
'em till they have made me &s;atisfaction for all my Subjects
that have been kill'd by them; of all my Towns which
they have burnt, and of all my Riches which they have
carried away.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> came to meet this
Prince in good order and well-arm'd, and made a
horrible &s;laughter among his Souldiers; they took
the King him&s;elf, who was carried on a &s;tately Seat
upon the Shoulders of his Subjects. This Prince
finding him&s;elf in this mi&s;erable Condition, began
to treat with 'em about his Ran&s;om, for which
he promi&s;ed to give 'em 4 Millions of Crowns: for
this Sum they engag'd to give him his Liberty; yet
would not &s;tand to their own Agreement, but
obliged him to a&s;&s;emble all his People, who to obey
their Prince's order came together in Crowds. This
King bore &s;uch a &s;way in the minds of his Subjects,
that he boa&s;ted that the Leaves of the Trees in the
Woods dur&s;t not move without his order. He told
<PB N="87" REF="53">
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he was their Pri&s;oner, and they had
now power to put him to death if they pleas'd.
Upon this they held a Council of War to deliberate
what to do with him; and re&s;olv'd to burn him
with a gentle Fire: only there was one Captain not
quite &s;o inhuman as the re&s;t, who told 'em they
ought to content them&s;elves with &s;trangling him,
and then burning him after he was dead. When
the King was inform'd that he was condemn'd to
die, he thus expre&s;s'd him&s;elf; <HI>Why will ye needs put
me to death? What Crime have I committed again&s;t
you? Did you not promi&s;e to re&s;tore me my Liberty, pro|vided
I would pay that Fine of Gold you impos'd on me?
Have not I given you a greater Sum than you demanded?
However if you are re&s;olv'd to kill me fir&s;t &s;end me at
lea&s;t to the King of</HI> Spain. But all his Complaints,
all his ju&s;t Reproaches and Prote&s;tations could not
hinder them from burning him. 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had no right to make War with
this Prince and to treat him &s;o inhumanly. But
the Captivity of this King, the Sentence of Death
pronounc'd again&s;t him, and the Cruelty with which
they put it in execution, after they had extorted
&s;uch va&s;t Trea&s;ures from him, all &s;ufficiently di&s;co|ver
the Genius of the&s;e Tyrants, and of what In|ju&s;tice
and Violence they have been guilty both
again&s;t the Princes and People of the new World.</P>
<P>I have a Letter from a Monk of the Order of
St. <HI>Francis</HI> written to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by which
it will appear how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> behav'd them&s;elves
towards the <HI>Indians:</HI> The very Terms of which

<LETTER>
<P>I, Frier <HI>Mark de Xlicia</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
General of all the Monks of the &s;aid Order in <HI>Peru,</HI> who
came into this Country with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that fir&s;t in|vaded
it, do te&s;tify what I have &s;een with my own Eyes of
<PB N="88" REF="54">
the manner of their treating the People of this new World.
Having been an Eye-witne&s;s, I have a certain knowledg
of the Di&s;po&s;ition and Manners of the Inhabitants of <HI>Pe|ru;</HI>
they are a meek, good-humour'd and peaceable Na|tion,
and have &s;hewn a great deal of Affection and Re|&s;pect
to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> I have &s;een 'em give 'em great
Sums of Gold and Silver, and Pearls of a great value
very readily; they render'd 'em all the Services they could
require of 'em with all the diligence that could be rea&s;onably
de&s;ir'd. They never offer'd to make War with 'em, nor
&s;o much as to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of Defence, till
they had receiv'd all imaginable Injuries from 'em, and
were thereby con&s;trained to it contrary to their Inclina|tions.
They gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as many Men and
Women as they needed for their Dome&s;tick Bu&s;ine&s;s;
and when they had receiv'd 'em into their Towns and
Villages with all the Honours they could think of, they
&s;upplied 'em liberally with all the nece&s;&s;ary Accommoda|tions
of Life.</P>
<P>I farther te&s;tify, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> without having
receiv'd the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of Offence from the <HI>Indians,</HI>
&s;eiz'd their great <HI>Cacique Atabalipa,</HI> &s;oon after they
enter'd his Country, and burnt him after they had receiv'd
four Millions of Gold of him, and after having taken
immen&s;e Sums out of his Province without any Re&s;i&s;tance.
They inflicted the &s;ame Puni&s;hment on <HI>Cochilimaca</HI> his
Captain General, when he came to meet them in an ami|cable
manner with many other Noblemen of <HI>Peru.</HI> A
few days after another great Lord of the Province of
<HI>Quitonia</HI> &s;uffer'd the &s;ame fate; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> burnt
him without having the lea&s;t occa&s;ion given 'em for &s;o
cruel an Action: With the like Barbarity and Inju&s;tice
they burnt <HI>Schapera</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Canaries.</HI> They
al&s;o burnt the feet of <HI>Aluis,</HI> the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Lord
of the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> and put him to a great
many other Torments to make him reveal K. <HI>Atabalipa</HI>'s
Trea&s;ures, of which he was utterly ignorant, as it evi|dently
<PB N="89" REF="54">
appear'd by the &s;equel. They condemn'd <HI>Coco|pagaganga</HI>
to the &s;ame Puni&s;hment, who was Prince of
the Province of <HI>Quitonia:</HI> He &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be
over per&s;waded by the Treaties of <HI>Seba&s;tian Banalca&ccedil;ar</HI>
a Spani&s;h Captain, to come in an amicable manner and
&s;urrender him&s;elf to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> this Captain having
given him his word that no Injury &s;hould be done him; yet,
contrary to this promi&s;e, he was burnt alive, with &s;everal
<HI>Caciques</HI> be&s;ides: and I have been inform'd, that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> de&s;ign'd to &s;hew no Mercy to any <HI>Indian</HI> in
the Country.</P>
<P>I moreover affirm, that I my &s;elf have &s;een the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in &s;everal places cut off the No&s;es, Ears and
Hands of Indian Men and Women, without any Provo|cation,
in cold Blood (as it &s;eem'd) purely for the &s;ake of
doing Mi&s;chief, which is a mo&s;t inexcu&s;able &s;ort of Bar|barity.
I have &s;een the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;et their fierce and
hungry Dogs at the <HI>Indians</HI> to tear 'em in pieces and de|vour
'em. And I have &s;een 'em &s;et fire to &s;o many
Towns and Villages, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould recollect
the number of 'em. 'Tis certain they have torn Children
from their Mothers Brea&s;ts, and thrown 'em with all their
might as far as they could, to divert them&s;elves with this
bruti&s;h Sport. I have often been a Witne&s;s of many other
Cruelties of this nature, which have fill'd me with Dread
and Horror; but I &s;hould be too prolix and tedious to give
the Detail of 'em.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, that once the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they had a&s;|&s;embled
the greate&s;t number of <HI>Indians</HI> they could in three
great Hou&s;es, &s;et fire to 'em and burnt 'em all alive,
without any rea&s;on, having not receiv'd the lea&s;t affront
from 'em. And a certain Prie&s;t, who&s;e name was <HI>Ocana,</HI>
happening to attempt to take a young Child out of the
Flames, a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that &s;aw him, took the Child from
him, and immediately ca&s;t it again into the Fire, where
it was burnt with the re&s;t. This <HI>Spaniard</HI> the &s;ame day
be committed this black and cur&s;ed Action, died &s;uddenly
<PB N="90" REF="55">
as he was going to the Camp; and I was of opinion that
his Carca&s;e ought not to be interred.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;end Deputies to the <HI>Ca|ciques</HI>
and chief <HI>Indians,</HI> to engage 'em to come and
meet 'em without fear, promi&s;ing 'em to employ their In|tere&s;t
with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> on their behalf: but as &s;oon
as they were come upon the Credit of the Promi&s;es that
had been given 'em, they were burnt without Pity or any
formal Proce&s;s. Two of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and con&s;ide|rable
<HI>Indians</HI> were burnt in my &s;ight, one at <HI>Andonia,</HI> and
the other at <HI>Tumbala.</HI> All the Efforts I made to &s;ecure
'em from the Flames, and to get 'em out of the hands of
the&s;e bloody Wretches, were to no purpo&s;e; my Di&s;cour&s;es
and Exhortations made no impre&s;&s;ion on 'em. I can
&s;ay with a good Con&s;cience, and in the pre&s;ence of God,
that &s;o far as I have been able to learn, by the long time
I have been among 'em, the Inhabitants of <HI>Peru</HI> have
never fomented any Mutiny or Rebellion, or done the lea&s;t
Injury to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have treated them &s;o inhu|manly;
but whatever Torments they have &s;uffer'd, they
&s;eem'd to have laid a&s;ide the thoughts of Revenge. And
when they found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were always deceiving
'em, and breaking the Promi&s;es they made 'em; when they
found they treated 'em with &s;o much Tyranny, contrary to
all Law and Equity; and that they did not &s;cruple to
commit all &s;orts of Outrages again&s;t 'em, they rather
cho&s;e to die, than to be continually expos'd to &s;uch Mi|&s;eries.</P>
<P>I have been inform'd by the Accounts the <HI>Indians</HI>
them&s;elves have given, that there is a great deal more
Gold among 'em undi&s;cover'd than has been yet found;
the ill &V;&s;age and Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having made
'em conceal it: and they are re&s;olv'd never to di&s;cover it
while they are treated with &s;o much Inju&s;tice and Tyranny,
but will rather die as their Companions have done, who
have been put to death with &s;o much Cruelty. The Injuries
offer'd the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> are very hainous Sins in the
<PB N="91" REF="55">
&s;ight of God, and contrary to the Intere&s;t and Service of
the King, who has been cheated of more Trea&s;ure in <HI>Peru</HI>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus far the Letter of that Monk, which was
confirm'd by the Atte&s;tation of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mexi|co:</HI>
He was an Eye-witne&s;s of what he here relates,
for he went through this Country for the &s;pace of
four&s;core or a hundred Leagues, and continued there
nine or ten years, in a time when there were but
few <HI>Spaniards</HI> there. But as &s;oon as it was reported
in <HI>Spain</HI> that this new World was &s;o full of Gold,
there pre&s;ently came four or five thou&s;and People,
who &s;pread them&s;elves through the&s;e noble Pro|vinces,
and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd five or &s;ix hundred Leagues of
the Country, which they entirely ruined, commit|ting
all tho&s;e Di&s;orders and Crimes that have been
mention'd before. They have de&s;troy'd a great ma|ny
more People here than this Frier takes notice of
in his Letter: and without having any fear of God
before their Eyes, or any regard to the King, or
the lea&s;t &s;entiment of Compa&s;&s;ion to their fellow-Creatures,
they have almo&s;t de&s;troy'd one half of
Mankind; for in the Provinces of <HI>Peru</HI> alone they
have kill'd above forty Millions of People.</P>
<P>A few days after what I have related above, they
kill'd a great Queen with Arrows made of Reeds;
&s;he was Wife to Prince <HI>Elingue,</HI> who &s;till governs
this Province in quality of King: the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
what they could to &s;eize this Prince's Per&s;on, and
omitted no Tricks and Artifices to accompli&s;h it;
this was the occa&s;ion of his Revolt again&s;t the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
and he has ever &s;ince continued their declar'd
Enemy. They took his Queen contrary to the Rules
of Equity and Ju&s;tice; and 'tis &s;aid they kill'd her
at a time when &s;he was big with Child, meerly to vex
and grieve the King her Husband, who lov'd her
<PB N="92" REF="56">
very tenderly. If all the Ma&s;&s;acres the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have committed in <HI>Peru</HI> &s;hould be recounted, every

that fir&s;t &s;et his foot in it was born at <HI>Grenada.</HI>
They that accompanied him were very profligate
Men, and extremely cruel; they &s;hed human Blood
without any &s;cruple or remor&s;e, for they had been
long accu&s;tom'd to all &s;orts of Wickedne&s;s, and
therefore 'tis the le&s;s to be wonder'd at that they
have committed &s;o many Crimes in this <HI>New Grenada,</HI>
where they abandon'd them&s;elves to all manner of
Abominations. I &s;hall only mention &s;ome In&s;tances
of 'em, becau&s;e an exact recital of their Cruelties
would fill the Minds of all that read this Hi&s;tory
with too much Horror.</P>
<P>A certain Governor that could not get his &s;hare
of the Booty another had got before him in ra|vaging
this new Kingdom of <HI>Grenada</HI> at his plea&s;ure,
tho he could have &s;econded him with all his heart
<PB N="93" REF="56">
in the Cruelties and Robberies he committed here;
yet being enrag'd to &s;ee &s;uch a valuable Prey e&s;cape
him, thought meet to appea&s;e his Trouble after a
&s;ort, and to revenge him&s;elf on the other by making
authentick Informations confirm'd by the concur|rent
Te&s;timony of many Witne&s;&s;es, which expos'd
to light all the Vexations, Murders and Cruelties
which this Tyrant had been guilty of in <HI>New Gre|nada.</HI>
The &s;aid Informations were read in the Coun|cil
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they have been hitherto pre|&s;erv'd,
and are yet to be &s;een.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Informations the Witne&s;&s;es depo&s;e, that
this new Kingdom enjoy'd a &s;ettled Peace before the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> came thither; that the People &s;hew'd 'em
all the kindne&s;s imaginable as &s;oon as they came a|mong
'em; that they maintain'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with
their Labour, and the Fruit of the Ground which
they manur'd; that they gave 'em prodigious quan|tities
of Gold, and abundance of precious Stones,
among&s;t others a great many Emeralds; that they
freely brought 'em whatever was mo&s;t valuable in
their Cities, the Government of which the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
divided among them&s;elves when they had can|ton'd
'em into &s;everal parts: for this they counted a
proper method, the better to compa&s;s their de&s;ign
of heaping together all the Gold they could po&s;&s;ibly
find.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Indians</HI> were fir&s;t &s;ubjugated to the
Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the chief Captain, who
was General of the re&s;t, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's
Per&s;on as well as of the Country, and kept him
Pri&s;oner for five or &s;ix Months, without any rea&s;on
in the World, demanding Gold and Emeralds of
him continually. This King, who&s;e name was <HI>Bogata,</HI>
in the mid&s;t of his fears, promis'd the Spani&s;h Ge|neral
to deliver up all the Gold-plate he had, hoping
by this means to get out of the hands of this Tyrant:
<PB N="94" REF="57">
he &s;ent a great many <HI>Indians</HI> to his Hou&s;e to fetch
the&s;e precious Goods; and at the &s;everal turns they
made he gave the <HI>Spaniard</HI> a great quantity of
Gold and Emeralds; who was not content with all
this, but threaten'd to kill him. Accordingly he
commanded this unfortunate King to be brought be|fore
him to receive his Sentence. This is the Treat|ment
the&s;e Tyrants give the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Per&s;ons
of the new World: This haughty General pro|nounc'd
a fatal Sentence again&s;t this Prince, by
which he was condemn'd to mo&s;t horrible Torments
if he did not immediately &s;end for all the Gold he
had: Accordingly this Tyrant's Executioners laid
hold of the King, &s;tretch'd him out at length upon
the ground naked, and pour'd boiling Ro&s;in upon his
Belly; be&s;ides this, they put his feet into a Fire, hav|ing
fa&s;ten'd his Neck to a Stake fix'd in the ground,
while two of the&s;e Hangmen held him by the Arms.
The cruel General came from time to time to look
upon him while this Torture continued, threatning
to take away his Life if he did not &s;peedily deliver
up his Gold. God &s;eem'd by his Providence to &s;ig|nify
his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the&s;e Cruelties, in &s;uf|fering
the City where they were committed to be
con&s;um'd with Fire in a moment. The re&s;t of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> took pattern by their General, and fill'd
up his &s;teps: And having no other trade than that
of tormenting the <HI>Indians,</HI> and cutting 'em in pieces,
they practi&s;ed the &s;ame Villanies in divers parts of
this Kingdom: They inflicted terrible Puni&s;hments
on &s;everal <HI>Caciques,</HI> and all their Subjects, who too
imprudently depended on the good words and pro|mi&s;es
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made 'em: And this after they
had given 'em incredible Sums of Gold, and many
Emeralds. The&s;e Pre&s;ents, tho &s;o valuable, could
not &s;often their obdurate Hearts, and render 'em
civil to their Benefactors&punc; The Tortures to which
<PB N="95" REF="57">
they put the <HI>Indians</HI> were to make 'em bring yet
more Gold and precious Stones; and the &s;ame motive
has induc'd 'em to burn all the great Lords of the
Country with a &s;low fire. A great multitude of
<HI>Indians</HI> one day came to meet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with a
great deal of humility and &s;implicity (as their man|ner
is) to offer 'em their &s;ervice, &s;uppo&s;ing them|&s;elves
&s;afe; but while they were &s;leeping without any
apprehen&s;ion of danger, being faint and weary,
a Spani&s;h Captain commanded his men to ma&s;&s;acre
'em all, which was accordingly executed. This
was done to &s;trike the whole Country with terror
and con&s;ternation, and to fright the Inhabitants
out of their Gold by the horror of &s;o tragical a
Spectacle. The General made his Souldiers &s;wear
how many <HI>Caciques</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> each of 'em had
kill'd, and how many they had re&s;erv'd alive for
their Slaves; the&s;e he immediately order'd 'em to
bring out into the mo&s;t publick place of their City,
and made 'em there cut off the heads of 4 or 500
of the&s;e poor Creatures. Divers Witne&s;&s;es have
depos'd that this Captain order'd the hands and no|&s;es
of many <HI>Indians</HI> both Men and Women to be cut
off, and exercis'd other unheard of Cruelties among
'em. He &s;ent into <HI>Bogata</HI>'s Province to enquire who
had &s;ucceeded that Prince, whom he had &s;o inhu|manly
put to death: The Men he &s;ent to make this
Di&s;covery took as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they could; &s;uch
of 'em as could not tell the name of their late Prin|ce's
Succe&s;&s;or, were barbarou&s;ly abus'd, &s;ome of 'em
had their Arms and Legs cut off; others were ex|pos'd
to the fury of greedy Dogs, and &s;oon torn in
pieces by 'em.</P>
<P>They fell upon a great number of Caciques and
Indian Noblemen by a treacherous &s;urprize in the
middle of the Night, after they had a&s;&s;ur'd 'em they
need not fear any affront or abu&s;e from them. The
<PB N="96" REF="58">
innocent <HI>Indians</HI> confiding in the&s;e fair promi&s;es,
were come down out of the Mountains where they
had hid them&s;elves, to lodg in the Cities, not &s;u&s;|pecting
the ill de&s;ign the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had again&s;t 'em:
However the&s;e perfidious men &s;urpriz'd 'em, and
cut off the Hands and Arms of all they took, let|ting
'em know they were cha&s;tiz'd after this &s;evere
manner for not telling the name of their late King's
Succe&s;&s;or. Another time the General &s;ent a great par|ty
of Soldiers into a City to make war with the In|habitants,
becau&s;e they &s;ent him not a basket of Gold
which he had demanded: they made the&s;e poor
people &s;uffer a thou&s;and Outrages, and ma&s;&s;acred va&s;t
numbers of 'em. They inhumanly cut off the no|&s;es
and hands both of Men and Women, and gave
others to be devour'd by their Dogs, which were
wont to be fed with human fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The people of one of the&s;e Provinces, &s;eeing
5 or 6 of their Chiefs burnt to death with a &s;low
fire, were frighted by this horrible &s;ight into the
mountains to &s;helter them&s;elves from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
they were about 5 or 6000: hereupon the Spani&s;h
Commander &s;ent a Company of Soldiers to pur&s;ue
'em, and treat 'em as Rebels. 'Tis hard to imagine
by what right they a&s;&s;um'd an Authority to puni&s;h
people as rebels, that were free-born, and did not
in the lea&s;t depend on 'em. When the Spani&s;h
Soldiers were got into this Mountain, they fell on
the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who were naked and di&s;arm'd,
with a fury like that of Wolves and Lions, when they
&s;et upon a flock of Sheep to devour 'em; till at
length they were &s;o &s;pent and fatigu'd meerly with
&s;laughtering the&s;e poor Creatures, that they were
forc'd to give over a while to take breath; after
which they renew'd this Ma&s;&s;acre with more vigour.
And to cut &s;hort their bloody work, they threw
down the greate&s;t part of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> headlong
<PB N="97" REF="58">
from the top of the Mountain, which was very high.
It has been depos'd by tho&s;e that were Eye-witne&s;&s;es
of this Tragedy, that they forc'd above 700 of the&s;e
poor <HI>Indians</HI> all together down this Precipice, &s;o
that they look'd like a Cloud as they fell; they were
all da&s;h'd in pieces by this dreadful fall, and died
mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pu&s;h'd on this barbarous Expedition
to the utmo&s;t; for they made a diligent &s;earch in
all the remote Corners of the Mountain, and gave
no quarter to any they found; tho&s;e they could catch
were either cut to pieces, or after many wounds ca&s;t
down from the top of the Mountain. Nor did the&s;e
Cruelties &s;atisfy 'em, but they &s;hut up divers <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
both Men and Women, whom they had re&s;erv'd
for Slaves, in a hou&s;e cover'd with &s;traw, which
they &s;et on fire and &s;o con&s;um'd 'em. They likewi&s;e
went to the City of <HI>Cola,</HI> where they took abun|dance
of People, with about 15 or 20 of their
Great Men; they expos'd the&s;e to the fury of their
Dogs, which devour'd 'em, having fir&s;t cut off the
hands and feet both of Men and Women; and
fix'd the&s;e &s;ad Spoils on Poles, that they might be
obvious to the view of all, and that the dreadful
&s;ight might ca&s;t terror and amazement in the minds
of all that &s;urviv'd.</P>
<P>The Ravage and Cruelties the&s;e bloody-minded
Men exerci&s;ed in this new Kingdom of <HI>Grenada</HI> are &s;o
great, that if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> dos not apply a &s;pee|dy
remedy, and &s;et bounds to their exce&s;&s;ive Avarice
and in&s;atiable thir&s;t of Gold, that whole Kingdom
will &s;oon be de&s;troy'd, and the Land lie unculti|vated
and unimprov'd, for want of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the &s;pace of 2 or 3 years, &s;ince this Kingdom
has been di&s;cover'd, they have without the fear of
God or Man put the Inhabitants to death, without
any emotion or pity to &s;ee &s;o much human blood
<PB N="98" REF="59">
pour'd out. There are now &s;carce any People to
be found there after all the&s;e Ma&s;&s;acres. There are
divers fine large Provinces near <HI>New Grenada;</HI> this
Country is called <HI>Popoyan</HI> and <HI>Cali,</HI> and is above
50 leagues in extent, which they al&s;o have ruined,
and made as de&s;olate as the former. Here they
have &s;o &s;laughter'd the people, that this once po|pulous
Country is now quite de&s;titute of Inhabitants.
Tho&s;e that come from thence relate &s;uch terrible
things of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> proceedings there, that one
can't hear their &s;ad Stories, without being pierc'd
with trouble and compa&s;&s;ion in a very &s;en&s;ible man|ner.
In the&s;e Provinces they have ruin'd many fine
Cities from one end to t'other; &s;o that they now
lie buried in their own A&s;hes: there are &s;carce any
of the ruins of tho&s;e Cities to be &s;een, which once
contain'd above 2000 Hou&s;es. In a word, this Coun|try
which was full of Villages, Towns, and Cities
for the &s;pace of 50 leagues, is now &s;o bare, that
there's &s;carce any token remaining to &s;ignifie there
ever were any &s;uch buildings.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came from <HI>Peru</HI> into <HI>New
Grenada</HI> and <HI>Popoyan</HI> through the Province of <HI>Qui|tonia;</HI>
others of 'em came to <HI>Cali</HI> by the way of
<HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Vraba,</HI> but all join'd together to car|ry
on the &s;ame de&s;ign, &s;poiling a Country of 600
leagues in extent of all its Riches, and extirpating
all the Inhabitants after they had plunder'd 'em.
When this cruel War was ended, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took
&s;ome of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom they had re&s;erved for
Slaves, into their &s;ervice, and caus'd the heads of &s;e|veral
of their Companions to be cut off in their &s;ight
to terrify 'em; telling 'em they mu&s;t all expect to
undergo the &s;ame fate, if they did not &s;erve 'em
faithfully. By the recital of &s;uch barbarous Actions
as the&s;e, the Reader may ea&s;ily imagin how the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
behave them&s;elves towards the <HI>Indians</HI> in the
<PB N="99" REF="59">
&s;everal parts of <HI>America.</HI> They feed their fierce
Dogs with human fle&s;h, on purpo&s;e to accu&s;tom 'em
to tear Men in pieces, and devour 'em. They car|ry
the&s;e Dogs with 'em wherever they go, and
barbarou&s;ly murder the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> to feed the&s;e
&s;avage Curs with their fle&s;h. They'l &s;ay one to ano|ther,
Give me a quarter of that <HI>Indian</HI> to make my
Dog a fea&s;t; and when I kill one, I'll pay you again.
They commonly hunt in the morning with the&s;e
Dogs; and when ask'd by their fellows what luck
they have had, they an&s;wer according to their &s;ucce&s;s.
Sometimes one will &s;ay, I am content, my Dogs have
kill'd about a &s;core of 'em; &s;o that one would think
they were &s;peaking of Wolves or wild Boars. Can
any thing be imagin'd that exceeds &s;uch horrible
Cruelty as this? And all the&s;e Barbarities have been
prov'd and averred by &s;trict Examinations made and
produc'd before the Council of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<P>But I &s;hall add no more, till I &s;hall receive farther
information of their other Villanies, which may be
expected to be yet greater than tho&s;e I have men|tion'd,
if greater can po&s;&s;ibly be committed. And
that which is mo&s;t deplorable is, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
take no care to &s;peak to the&s;e people of the My|&s;teries

who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Frier <HI>Bartholomew de Las-Ca&s;as,</HI> Monk of the
Order of <HI>St. Dominique,</HI> having &s;ignified my de&s;ire to
be recall'd from the <HI>Indies,</HI> had leave to come over to
the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> to give an account of the deplorable
Condition of the <HI>Indians.</HI> To this I have been mov'd
by the Zeal with which God has in&s;pir'd me for Souls re|deem'd
by his Blood. My earne&s;t de&s;ire is, that they
may know their Creator, and embrace his Word, that
they may be &s;av'd. And I cannot choo&s;e but extremely
pity <HI>Spain,</HI> my native Country, becau&s;e I am greatly
afraid God will utterly de&s;troy it, for the enormous
Crimes committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (who go into the <HI>In|dies)</HI>
both again&s;t God, again&s;t the King, and again&s;t
their Neighbours. I don't doubt but divers illu&s;trious
Per&s;ons of this Court, who are truly zealous for the Sal|vation
of Souls, are very &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the Cala|mities
and Mi&s;eries tho&s;e multitudes of poor Creatures
&s;uffer in the New World, who are abandon'd to the fury
of the Spani&s;h Souldiers. I re&s;olv'd long ago to draw up
an exact relation of the&s;e matters, but have been &s;till
hinder'd by the continual urgency of tho&s;e affairs in which
I have been engag'd till now. However I have at length
accompli&s;h'd this de&s;ign at <HI>Valence,</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Decem|ber,
Anno</HI> 1542. This Treati&s;e gives a &s;hort account
of the Violence, Tyranny, Per&s;ecutions, Robberies, Ma&s;|&s;acres
and Deva&s;tations committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in
all the parts of <HI>America</HI> where they have di&s;pers'd them|&s;elves.
<PB N="101" REF="60">
The&s;e Calamities and Di&s;orders are advanc'd to
a degree that &s;urpa&s;&s;es all belief, and is the more &s;urpriz|ing
in that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are much le&s;s furious and cruel
every where el&s;e. Indeed the People of <HI>Mexico</HI> and of the
places adjacent, are now treated much better than others;
in&s;omuch that no body there dares offer violence to any
<HI>Indian</HI> openly: 'Tis true they exact immen&s;e Sums of
'em, but the forms of Ju&s;tice are at lea&s;t &s;o ob&s;erv'd,

great hope our Illu&s;trious Lord, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Em|peror
and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who begins to take cognizance
of the Tyranny and ill behaviour of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> toward
the <HI>Indians,</HI> will undertake the protection of the&s;e mi&s;e|rable
People, who are per&s;ecuted again&s;t his will, as well
as again&s;t the will of God. All the mi&s;eries that have
bin inflicted on the&s;e newly di&s;cover'd Nations have bin hi|therto
conceal'd from our Prince with no le&s;s &s;ubtilty and

<P>A year after the writing of all of the&s;e matters
above recited, there were publi&s;hed in the City of
<HI>Madera</HI> certain Laws and Con&s;titutions made by his
Maje&s;ty at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> in the month of <HI>December</HI> in the
year 1542. which were calculated according to the
urgent nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs to rectify the Di&s;orders
that were then commited with &s;o much In&s;olence both
again&s;t God and Man, to the utter de&s;truction and
de&s;olation of the New World. For the con&s;tituting
of the&s;e wi&s;e Laws his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;embled a great
<PB N="102" REF="61">
many Per&s;ons, illu&s;trious both for their Quality and
Learning, and moreover endued with great Piety,
who deliberated on the&s;e important Affairs in di|vers
Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Valladolid.</HI> At length by the unani|mous
Con&s;ent of the whole A&s;&s;embly, divers Pro|po&s;itions
were ratified and publi&s;h'd; and which ap|pear
the more conformable to the Rules of Chri&s;tia|nity,
in as much as the Per&s;ons who compos'd this
famous A&s;&s;embly had never been any way concern'd
in the Outrages offer'd the <HI>Indians;</HI> they were &s;uch
as had neither wa&s;h'd their hands in their Blood,
nor reap'd any advantage by the immen&s;e Trea&s;ures
that had been taken from 'em with &s;o much Vio|lence,
after the murder of incredible numbers
of innocent People. For the Avarice and Cruelty
of tho&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> who fir&s;t &s;et foot in <HI>America</HI> have
been the fatal Cau&s;es of all the Mi&s;eries that new

<P>After the publication of the&s;e new Orders for
regulating the Affairs of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Protectors
of tho&s;e cruel Tyrants, who had &s;till &s;ome Credit
at Court, procur'd &s;everal Precepts to con&s;titute
Officers to &s;end into divers Provinces of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
for they were much concern'd to &s;ee the cour&s;e of

they to whom the care of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Di&s;or|ders,
and preventing the farther In&s;ults of the&s;e
Tyrants was committed, made no con&s;cience of
violating that Equity and Fidelity they ow'd both to
God and their Prince; for they knew very well
what effect the Edicts that were made mu&s;t needs
have, and therefore alarm'd the People before the
arrival of the Judges who were &s;ent to the <HI>Indies</HI>
to publi&s;h the Laws of their Prince, and to put 'em

a Prince; and being willing to take part with tho&s;e
Tyrants, that they might have a &s;hare of the Booty,
behav'd them&s;elves with a Cruelty beyond imagi|nation,
and ju&s;tified tho&s;e Villanies which they were
&s;ent to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>So that &s;ince the year 1542, &s;uch Rapine and
Violence has been committed in <HI>Peru,</HI> that the like
has not been heard of either in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or any
other part of the World: Nor do they exerci&s;e
their Cruelty only on the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom they have
almo&s;t exterminated, but are &s;uffer'd by the ju&s;t
Judgment of God to turn their Arms one again&s;t
another with great fury to their mutual de&s;truction.
Some of the People of this new World under the
protection of the&s;e Rebels, were encourag'd to re|fu&s;e
Obedience to the Emperor's Orders; others
pretending they were de&s;irous to addre&s;s Petitions
to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, have &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to
be carried down the &s;tream with the re&s;t, and have
revolted too. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not ea&s;ily per|&s;waded
to &s;urrender tho&s;e Trea&s;ures they have un|ju&s;tly
u&s;urped, or to relea&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> whom
they have in&s;lav'd. If they don't &s;o often ma&s;&s;acre
'em, they increa&s;e the weight of their Irons, and im|po&s;e
Laws on 'em more and more unju&s;t and rigo|rous.
And the King with all his Authority has not
yet been able to &s;top the cour&s;e of the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs,
becau&s;e they are generally link'd together in a Con|federacy,
both &s;mall and great; and all u&s;e the li|centious
trade of robbing and &s;poiling more or le&s;s
according to their power, &s;ome more publickly,
and others after a clande&s;tine manner. But that
which yet further di&s;covers the Boldne&s;s and In&s;o|lence
of the&s;e Hypocrites is, that they &s;till make
<PB N="104" REF="62">
pretences that they con&s;ult nothing but the King's
Intere&s;t, and the Glory of God in all they do;
while 'tis mo&s;t apparent, they are continually rob|bing
the King, and that with impunity, and are
always di&s;honouring God and Religion by their cri|minal
and &s;candalous Practices.</P>
<P>That which next follows is a Fragment of a Let|ter
of a certain Per&s;on who accompanied the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in their Voyages and Journies, giving an ac|count
of their Actions in the various places through
which they pa&s;s'd: But this Letter being de&s;ign'd to
be &s;ent with other Papers, he that made up the
Packets lo&s;t &s;everal Pages of it which contain'd very
remarkable and extraordinary things concerning the
Actions of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This Fragment I &s;end you
is the Body of the Letter, the beginning and end of
which are both wanting. However, &s;eeing that
which it contains de&s;erves the notice of the Publick,
I thought meet to print it, and hope the view of it
will produce the &s;ame effect of moving you to com|mi&s;erate
the Calamities of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> as I
pre&s;ume the more ample Relation I have given you
above has done: And con&s;equently that your won|ted
Charity will excite in your Minds an ardent de|&s;ire
to oppo&s;e and rectify all tho&s;e Di&s;orders as much
as in you lies.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;The Captain order'd the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> to
be chain'd for Slaves, which was pre&s;ently done,
and he carried away with him great numbers of
Men and Women in Chains; &s;o that the whole
Country was &s;oon turn'd into a De&s;ert. They
took away all the Crop of Corn the&s;e poor Crea|tures
had, and whatever el&s;e they had laid up for
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their Families, by which means
<PB N="105" REF="62">
they were &s;oon reduc'd to extreme want; &s;o that
many were found dead in the High-ways merely
with Famine. There were al&s;o above ten thou&s;and
of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took to carry their
Baggage, that died on the Coa&s;ts: for almo&s;t all
that went any di&s;tance from the Sea were kill'd
with the exce&s;&s;ive Heat they met with on the Con|tinent.
This &s;ame Captain following the &s;teps of
<HI>John Ampudia,</HI> &s;ent before him two <HI>Indians</HI> whom
he had taken in the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> to di&s;co|ver
the Villages and Towns that were in their way,
and where any Booty was to be got; the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>
were either his own Slaves, or tho&s;e of his Soul|diers,
&s;ome of whom had two or three hundred
Slaves a Man, and others more or le&s;s, as they had
more or le&s;s Baggage and Provi&s;ions to carry.
The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> return'd to their Ma&s;ter, together
with &s;uch others as they could bring away with 'em.
And in the&s;e Expeditions all &s;orts of Cruelties were
committed upon Women and Children. They did
the &s;ame in the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> they fir'd
their Hou&s;es wherever they came, and burnt all
the Stores of Corn the <HI>Indians</HI> had. And to &s;hew
their &s;pite the more, as if all this Mi&s;chief had
been too little, they kill'd their Cattel only for
the Suet and Marrow, having no occa&s;ion for the
Fle&s;h; only the <HI>Indians</HI> who attended the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in the&s;e Expeditions ate the Livers, that being one
of their principal Di&s;hes. 'Tis &s;carce to be be|lieved
what numbers of Cattel they kill'd here;
they de&s;troy'd above a hundred thou&s;and after this
manner only for the Fat and Livers, and &s;o made
the Country de&s;olate by this needle&s;s &s;laughter,
which brought &s;uch a Famine and Mi&s;ery upon the
Inhabitants, that they died for want of Food:
They be&s;ides carried away out of this Province all
the Corn they did not burn; &s;o that tho the Coun|try
<PB N="106" REF="63">
produces abundance, there was &s;o great a Scar|city,
that a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Septier is a mea&s;ure of Corn containing about 240 pound weight.</NOTE> Septier of Corn was worth ten
Crowns, and a Lamb was &s;old for the &s;ame Price.</P>
<P>The Commander of the&s;e Troops being return'd
from the Sea-Coa&s;t, re&s;olv'd to leave the Province
of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> and to join <HI>John Ampudia.</HI> To ac|compli&s;h
this De&s;ign he rai&s;ed above two hundred
Men Hor&s;e and Foot, among which were divers
Citizens of <HI>Quitonia.</HI> He gave 'em leave to bring
with them the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and all the other <HI>Indians</HI>
which had formerly fallen to their &s;hare, and to
add as many others to 'em as they pleas'd, which
they did. One <HI>Alphon&s;o Sanchez</HI> carried with him
his <HI>Cacique,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Nenuyta,</HI> with a hun|dred
other <HI>Indians</HI> and their Wives. <HI>Peter Cobo</HI>
accompanied him with a hundred and fifty <HI>Indians</HI>
and their Wives, who were forc'd to drag their
Children after 'em, for fear they &s;hould peri&s;h with
Hunger. One <HI>Moran,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Popayan</HI> carried
above two hundred People with him; and all the
re&s;t of the Souldiers did the &s;ame proportionably
to their Stock and Occa&s;ions. They de&s;ir'd permi&s;|&s;ion
to make all the Indian Men and Women that
attended 'em their ab&s;olute Slaves, which was
granted; and this Privilege continued as long as
they liv'd, tho the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were the Subjects and
Va&s;&s;als of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> as well as the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>With &s;uch an Equipage as this our General left
the City of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> to go take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
of <HI>Octaba,</HI> which fell to his lot. He demanded of
the <HI>Cacique</HI> five hundred Men to join his Forces,
which were deliver'd to him, with divers other
Per&s;ons of Note. Part of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> he di&s;tri|buted
<PB N="107" REF="63">
among his Souldiers, and took the re&s;t to
him&s;elf, &s;ome of whom were loaded with Chains,
and others with his Baggage and Provi&s;ions. 'Twas
a lamentable &s;ight to &s;ee the&s;e poor Wretches tied
one to another with Cords. When the&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI>
parted from the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> they carried
away no le&s;s than &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Indians,</HI> of which
&s;carce twenty came back to their own Country;
for the extreme Fatigues and &s;corching Heat they
endur'd in tho&s;e hot Countries &s;oon cut 'em off.</P>
<P>The General having made <HI>Alphon&s;o Sanchez</HI> Cap|tain
of a Company, this Brute meeting &s;ome
Women and Children in his way, loaded with
Provi&s;ions, and waiting for him to pre&s;ent him
with what they had brought, ma&s;&s;acred 'em all
without pity. In this cruel Action, a <HI>Spaniard</HI>
going about to kill an Indian Woman broke his
Sword in two the fir&s;t blow he gave her; at the
&s;econd &s;troke he broke it again, &s;o that he had no|thing
but the Hilt left in his hand: but that which
is more &s;urprizing is, that this poor Woman re|ceiv'd
no Wound by the blows he gave her. Ano|ther
Souldier &s;triking an Indian Woman with a
large Dagger, had about three Inches of it broken
off at the fir&s;t &s;troke, and the whole Blade quite
to the Hilt at the &s;econd.</P>
<P>When this General, of whom we have been
&s;peaking, parted from <HI>Quitonia,</HI> he cruelly &s;epa|rated
Husbands and Wives one from another,
giving the young Women to the <HI>Indians</HI> that went
with him, and leaving the old Women to tho&s;e
that remain'd in the City. One of the&s;e Women
follow'd him with loud Cries when he went away,
and beg'd of him with abundance of Tears, that
he would not take away her Husband from her,
telling him &s;he had the charge of three Children,
and 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible for her to provide for
<PB N="108" REF="64">
'em if &s;he were bereav'd of her Husband; &s;o that
they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;tarv'd. The General re|puls'd
her not without &s;ome Indignation, upon
which &s;he redoubled her Sighs and Cries, telling
him her Children were ready to die with Hunger:
at length &s;eeing her Prayers and Tears made no
Impre&s;&s;ion on him, &s;he took a Stone and da&s;h'd out
the Brains of all her Children in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>When this Commander arriv'd in the City of
<HI>Palo,</HI> which is &s;ituate in the Province of <HI>Lilia,</HI> he
met with Captain <HI>John Ampudia,</HI> who went before
him to make a di&s;covery of the Country, and to
&s;ettle Peace in it: he was now Governor of this
City, which had a Gari&s;on in the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Name, and was under the direction of the Mar|que&s;s
<HI>Francis de Piccaro,</HI> who had e&s;tabli&s;h'd a
Council there con&s;i&s;ting of eight Coun&s;ellors, that
had the In&s;pection of the whole Country, and kept
it in Peace and Union by the good management of
<HI>Peter Solano de Quenon. Ampudia</HI> hearing our Ge|neral
was arriv'd in the Country, came to give him
a Vi&s;it, accompanied with many of the Inhabitants
and <HI>Indians,</HI> who brought him abundance of Fruit,
and other Provi&s;ions. Many of the neighbouring
<HI>Indians</HI> came afterwards on the &s;ame Errand, and
after them the Inhabitants of <HI>Xamundia, Palonia, So|limania</HI>
and <HI>Bolonia,</HI> did the like. But becau&s;e they
did not bring &s;o great a quantity of Corn as de|manded,
the General &s;ent a Troop of Souldiers
with a great many <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;eek &s;ome el&s;ewhere,
with Orders to take it where ever they found it.
With this Order they went into <HI>Palonia</HI> and <HI>Bolo|nia,</HI>
where they found the <HI>Indians</HI> dwelling very
peaceably in their Hou&s;es; and without any re|gard
to the Laws of Nations or of Ho&s;pitality,
took away all the Corn and other Provi&s;ions, to|gether
with all the Gold and Silver they had, and
<PB N="109" REF="64">
put many of the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in Chains to make
Slaves of 'em. The&s;e unhappy People came to
make their Complaint to the General of the ill
Treatment and Inju&s;tice they had &s;uffer'd, and to
intreat him to cau&s;e Re&s;titution to be made of
what had been &s;o violently taken from 'em, but in
vain, for he would do nothing in the matter, only
gave 'em his promi&s;e that his Men &s;hould do 'em no
hurt for the future, and that they &s;hould never come
again into their Country: yet four or five days
after they went into another part of the Country
for Corn, and pillag'd the poor <HI>Indians</HI> as they had
done before; who were &s;o provok'd to &s;ee them|&s;elves
deluded by the General, who had broke his
Promi&s;es almo&s;t as &s;oon as he had made 'em, that
the whole Country betook them&s;elves to their
Arms in an in&s;tant; which Tumult afterwards oc|ca&s;ion'd
many Di&s;orders and great Offences to be
commited both again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of God and
the Dignity of the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> At length the&s;e
People fled, and left this whole Country de&s;olate.
They that retreated into the Mountains came down
from time to time to &s;eek Provi&s;ion; the <HI>Indians</HI>
likewi&s;e engag'd in a cruel War one with another,
wherein the &s;tronger party us'd to eat the weaker:
For that Indian Nation that inhabits the Moun|tains
are a fierce and warlike People, and mor|tal
Enemies to their Neighbours. After this In|&s;urrection
the General went to the City of <HI>Ampu|dia,</HI>
where he receiv'd all the Honours due to his
Character; he afterwards march'd with two hun|dred
Hor&s;e and Foot toward <HI>Lilia</HI> and <HI>Pelinia.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ent his Captains all round the Country to
make a cruel War upon the <HI>Indians;</HI> they fir'd a
great many Hou&s;es, robb'd all that fell into their
hands, and kill'd abundance of 'em. This killing
and pillaging continued many days together. The
<PB N="110" REF="65">
Lord of the Country hoped to put a &s;top to the&s;e
Mi&s;eries, and to allay the bloody Rage of the&s;e Ty|gers
by &s;ending their Subjects to 'em with all &s;orts
of Provi&s;ions and other Pre&s;ents. Soon after this
they came to <HI>Lilia</HI> with all the <HI>Indians</HI> they had
taken, for they would not di&s;charge one of 'em.
They pa&s;s'd through <HI>Ycea</HI> in their way, and were
no &s;ooner arriv'd there, but they fell to pillaging
and ma&s;&s;acring all they met with; they exercis'd
their u&s;ual trade of firing their Hou&s;es, they con|&s;um'd
above a hundred of 'em in one Village; nor
did other Towns and Cities in the neighbouring
Country, which they call <HI>Tulilicui,</HI> fare any better.
When the <HI>Cacique</HI> at the head of a great company
of <HI>Indians</HI> came to meet 'em, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Com|mander
demanded Gold of him and his Subjects:
they told him they had no great quantity, but
would readily give him all they had; and accor|dingly
brought him that little they had got toge|ther.
Upon which he deliver'd a kind of Receipt
&s;ign'd with his own hand to each of 'em, which was
to &s;erve for a token by which to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e
that had given him Gold from the re&s;t; adding,
that whoever had not this Receipt &s;hould be ex|pos'd
to the Dogs to the devour'd by 'em. The
poor Creatures terrified by the&s;e Menaces, brought
him all the Gold they had in very great ha&s;te, and
tho&s;e that had none were fain to retire into the
Mountains, or into other Cities to &s;ave their Lives;
and thus the Country was depriv'd of the greate&s;t
part of its Inhabitants. A little after he order'd
the <HI>Cacique</HI> to &s;end two <HI>Indians</HI> to the City of
<HI>Agua,</HI> to &s;ignify that he requir'd the Inhabitants to
meet him, which they might do with &s;afety, and
to bring with them all the Gold they could. After
he had di&s;patch'd this Order, he went to another
City, and the &s;ame might &s;ent a party of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="65">
to &s;eize &s;ome of the People of <HI>Tulilicui,</HI> who
brought him a hundred Men and Women the day
following, of which he re&s;erv'd the mo&s;t robu&s;t
and lu&s;ty, whom he thought fit to carry great Bur|dens,
for him&s;elf and his Souldiers, and put many
of 'em in Chains, giving the young Children to
the <HI>Cacique</HI> of <HI>Tulilicui</HI> to eat, in who&s;e Hou&s;e their
Skins fill'd with A&s;hes are &s;till to be &s;een. After
this Expedition he went toward the Provinces of
<HI>Calili,</HI> where he join'd Captain <HI>John d' Ampudia,</HI>
who was gone another way to make a further
di&s;covery. The&s;e two Commanders left great
marks of their Cruelty in all the Provinces through
which they pa&s;s'd. <HI>Ampudia</HI> happen'd to come
to a certain City, the Governor of which, who&s;e
name was <HI>Bitacon,</HI> had made deep works under
ground to hinder the approach of an Enemy:
Two of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Hor&s;es, that of one <HI>Antony
Redondon,</HI> and that of <HI>Marc Marqu&eacute;s,</HI> fell into the&s;e
Traps, and the latter of 'em dy'd with the fall,
but the other e&s;cap'd the danger. However this
&s;mall lo&s;s by the Stratagem of the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;o pro|vok'd
this Captain, that he order'd his Men to
take all of 'em they could light on, which was
about three hundred, and to ca&s;t 'em into the&s;e
Pits; be&s;ides this they fir'd a hundred Hou&s;es.
From hence they came to a very great and populous
City, here they had no Interpreter by whom to
conver&s;e with the&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> however they ma&s;&s;a|cred
abundance of 'em with their Swords and
Lances. As &s;oon as the&s;e two Commanders met
one another again after all the&s;e Expeditions, <HI>Am|pudia</HI>
gave the other a relation of what he did at
<HI>Bitaconia,</HI> and told him how many <HI>Indians</HI> he had
ca&s;t into the Pits that were made at the entrance
of the City, while the other applauded all he had
done, telling him he had rea&s;on to &s;erve 'em after
<PB N="112" REF="66">
that manner: And added, that for his part he had
de&s;troy'd above two hundred <HI>Indians</HI> near the Ri|ver
<HI>Bamba,</HI> which waters the Province of <HI>Quito|nia.</HI>
Thus the&s;e two Tyrants made War upon all
this Country at the &s;ame time. They both after
this enter'd into the Provinces of <HI>Birumia</HI> and
<HI>Anzerma,</HI> where they left everla&s;ting tokens of
their Barbarity and Fury. One <HI>Francis Garcia,</HI>
whom they &s;ent out to pillage the Country, treated
the People with abundance of In&s;olence, till he
reduc'd 'em to extreme Indigence and Mi&s;ery.
The <HI>Indians</HI> came to him by couples, making
&s;igns to de&s;ire Peace for the whole Country, pro|mi&s;ing
to give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all they &s;hould de|mand,
and to deliver up their Gold, and their
Wives too, provided they would give 'em their
Lives; but receiv'd no other An&s;wer from this
cruel <HI>Garcia,</HI> but that they mu&s;t be gone, for he
had drank too much, and was now in no condition
to con&s;ider of what they &s;aid. He enter'd their
Country full of Fury, and running through the
whole Province, put it all under Military Execu|tion,
robbing, and &s;poiling, and ma&s;&s;acring the
Inhabitants without mercy: he carried away
two thou&s;and of the People with him, who were
put in Chains, and dy'd under the rigor of their
cruel Bondage: And before he left this Country
he put fifty more to a violent Death.</P>
<P>After he had fill'd this Province with mi&s;ery
and horror, he pa&s;&s;ed into the Province of <HI>Calili.</HI>
When any of the <HI>Indians</HI> that carried his Baggage
fainted with wearine&s;s, and fell under their Bur|dens
in the way, they kill'd 'em on the &s;pot, to
terrify the re&s;t by the&s;e bloody Actions, that none
of 'em might dare to pretend them&s;elves &s;ick to
get rid of their Burdens and Labours. And thus
they were all de&s;troy'd by degrees; for partly be|cau&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="66">
they were not &s;ufficiently look'd after, and
partly becau&s;e unrea&s;onable Labour was exacted of
'em, there was not &s;o much as one of all tho&s;e <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
left alive, which they brought from <HI>Quitonia,
Pa&s;tonia, Quilla, Cangapatra, Popaya, Lilia, Calicia,</HI>
and <HI>Anzerma.</HI> As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd, they
pa&s;t through a great City, where they put mo&s;t
of the Inhabitants to the Sword, and carried away
300 Pri&s;oners, whom they in&s;lav'd according to
their u&s;ual manner.</P>
<P>The General &s;ent <HI>John Ampudia,</HI> when they
were in the Province of <HI>Lilia,</HI> with a con&s;iderable
Party of Soldiers into tho&s;e parts of the Country
mo&s;t inhabited, to take as many <HI>Indians</HI> as he could
to carry the Baggage; becau&s;e not one of that num|ber
they brought from <HI>Anzerma</HI> and <HI>Allia,</HI> which
amounted to about 1000 Men, was able to endure
the Fatigue, but all died in the way. They here
took as many as they had occa&s;ion for to carry their
Baggage, and the re&s;t were left to the di&s;cretion
of the Soldiers, who put 'em in Chains, and kept
'em till they were &s;tarv'd; &s;o that this Country
was quite unpeopled, neither <HI>Spaniards</HI> nor <HI>Indians</HI>
being now to be found in it. After all the&s;e Ra|vages,
they advanc'd toward <HI>Popaya,</HI> leaving
<HI>Martin d' Aquirra</HI> by the way, he being unable to
follow the re&s;t. As &s;oon as they arriv'd at <HI>Popaya;</HI>
they form'd a Gari&s;on in the City, and treated the
Inhabitants with the &s;ame In&s;olence and Violence
they had us'd in all other parts of the Country where
they had made their Progre&s;s. Here they coined
Money with the King's Image and Arms upon it;
they &s;tamp'd all the Gold they had, as well as
that which <HI>John d' Ampudia</HI> had got by his Rob|beries,
after this manner. All this Gold was
melted by the General's Order, without keeping
any Account of it, or paying any of the Soldiers,
<PB N="114" REF="67">
unle&s;s it were &s;uch as had lo&s;t their Hor&s;es; &s;o
that he kept almo&s;t all the Gold for his own private
u&s;e. He pretended indeed to take the 5<HI>th</HI> part of
it, which is the King's due, and to go to <HI>Cuzco</HI> to
give an Account of it to his Maje&s;ty's Intendent;

of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> taking up many <HI>Indians</HI> as he went,
who all died under the heavy Yoke of their &s;lavery.
He afterwards effac'd the King's Image, which he
had &s;tamp'd upon this new Money. And 'tis re|markable
concerning this Man, that he could not
but reflect on all the mi&s;chief he had done, and on
the Cruelties he had committed; for he was wont
to &s;ay of him&s;elf, Whoever &s;hall come into the&s;e
Provinces 50 years hence, and be told what kind
of life I led here, will &s;ay, <HI>Such a Tyrant went this
way, and here are everla&s;ting marks of his Violence
and Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be conceal'd from <HI>Your Highne&s;s,</HI> that
the re&s;t of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> who came into the <HI>Indies</HI>
after him, have endeavour'd to tread in his &s;teps,
and have exactly follow'd the Example he &s;et 'em;
for they have committed the &s;ame Inju&s;tice and
Villany and &s;o they &s;till continue to do.</P>

<P>Among the other Remedies propos'd by the Lord
<HI>Bartholomew de Las-Ca&s;as</HI> in the A&s;&s;embly of Prelats
and Learned Men whom the King call'd together at
<HI>Valladolid,</HI> to reform the Affairs of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in
the year 1542, he advi&s;es, That the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
&s;hould take the <HI>Indians</HI> under his protection, and
con&s;ider 'em as his lawful Subjects, that by this
means they may be &s;helter'd and guarded from the
continual Tyranny and In&s;olence of their Enemies,
and not be utterly extirpated by Ma&s;&s;acres, which
have bin &s;o often committed with Impunity. For as
fruitful and populous as this New World has been,
<PB N="115" REF="67">
it will &s;oon be laid entirely wa&s;te, and turn'd into a
barren De&s;ert, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be &s;till &s;uffer'd to
root out the Inhabitants, as they have hitherto
done.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="bishop to the king">
<HEAD>The Words of the Bi&s;hop on this Subject are as
follows:</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t proper and be&s;t Expedient, and which is
of great importance for your Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, with|out
which all others will be fruitle&s;s, is, that your Ma|je&s;ty
&s;end expre&s;s Orders to all your Courts and Tri|bunals
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to receive all the <HI>Indians,</HI> both
tho&s;e that have been already &s;ubjugated, and tho&s;e
that &s;hall be conquer'd for time to come, into the num|ber
of your free Subjects, that all the Provinces they
inhabit be united to the Kingdoms of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and
<HI>Leon,</HI> and that all the Inhabitants be incorporated
as your own People, &s;o that they &s;hall not be capa|ble
of being in&s;laved by any <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and that this
Law and Order be inviolably ob&s;erv'd: that for the
future the&s;e new Provinces may not be di&s;member'd
and alienated from the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> under any
pretext what&s;oever, tho never &s;o great nece&s;&s;ity
&s;hould be pretended; and never &s;o pre&s;&s;ing inter|ce&s;&s;ion
be made with your Maje&s;ty to obtain the Ti|tle
of a particular Soveraignty for any one: That
all the world may know that the Government
of tho&s;e Provinces that are &s;ubdued in the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
is in&s;eparably united to your Maje&s;ty's Crown,
and a part of your Property. That to confirm this
Con&s;titution the better, and to render it the more
&s;olemn and inviolable, your Maje&s;ty would plea&s;e to
take an Oath upon the Holy Go&s;pel, on your Crown,
and all that is mo&s;t &s;acred, in the form and manner
Princes are wont to do on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that you
will never revoke this Edict; and that your Succe&s;|&s;ors
<PB N="116" REF="68">
be oblig'd to take the &s;ame Oath: And that your
Maje&s;ty take care to make it one expre&s;s Article of
your la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament to engage your Succe&s;|&s;ors
to ob&s;erve this Law, and to make others ob|&s;erve
it, as much as lies in their Power.</P>
<P>Divers rea&s;ons are afterwards produc'd to &s;hew
that this Policy is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for the Pre|&s;ervation
of <HI>America,</HI> and to hinder the utter Extir|pation
of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The in&s;atiable Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
mind nothing but to ama&s;s together heaps of Trea|&s;ure,
makes 'em unwilling to &s;uffer any Prie&s;t or
Monk to come into tho&s;e Cities where they are
Ma&s;ters, for fear their worldly Intere&s;t &s;hould receive
con&s;iderable damage by that &s;ort of Men; becau&s;e
(they &s;ay) it makes the <HI>Indians</HI> idle, to a&s;&s;emble 'em
(as they do) to in&s;truct 'em in the matters of Reli|gion;
for all the time they take up to preach to 'em,
they detain 'em from the Work impo&s;ed on 'em.
Sometimes when the poor <HI>Indians</HI> have been a&s;&s;em|bled
for their in&s;truction in Chri&s;tianity, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
have in&s;olently acco&s;ted 'em with Cudgels in
their hands; taking &s;uch a number of 'em as they
think fit, to carry their Baggage or any &s;uch like Ser|vice;
and if they are unwilling to obey, they force
'em to it with Blows in the &s;ight of all the re&s;t,
and in the pre&s;ence of the Monks that in&s;truct 'em;
which is a great Scandal to our Religion, and a
mighty Ob&s;tacle to their Conver&s;ion, who are
&s;trangely terrified and hinder'd in the&s;e pious Exer|ci&s;es
as well as the Monks that preach to 'em, by
this ill u&s;age.</P>
<P>Another Inconvenience the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend they
receive from the&s;e In&s;tructions, is, that when the <HI>In|dians</HI>
are converted and plac'd in the number of Chri|&s;tians,
they grow proud and in&s;olent, thinking bet|ter
of them&s;elves than they are, and refu&s;e to work &s;o
<PB N="117" REF="68">
hard as they did before. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very
ambitious to command the <HI>Indians</HI> as their ab&s;olute
Slaves, and to be obey'd, re&s;pected, and even a|dor'd
by 'em; and therefore omit nothing that may
hinder them from becoming Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Sometimes 3 or 4 Towns or Villages are given
up to the di&s;po&s;al of a certain number of <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and the Inhabitants di&s;tributed among 'em, to &s;ome
more, to others fewer; and it often happens that
a Woman falls to one Man's &s;hare, who&s;e Husband
falls to the Lot of another, and their Children to
a third; &s;o that they divide the&s;e mi&s;erable Fami|lies
like Flocks of Sheep. They employ 'em in all
&s;orts of &s;ervice, as to manure the ground, to work
in the Mines, and to carry Burdens in Journeys of
50 or 60 Leagues. And their Ma&s;ters &s;o con&s;tantly
exact the hard Tasks of Work they &s;et 'em, that the
poor Wretches have not time to attend the In&s;tructi|ons
of the Divine Word, and to learn the Rules of
Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e People, tho free, have been
made Slaves, and the greate&s;t part of 'em de&s;troy'd.
Parents and Children have been &s;laughter'd toge|ther;
Villages and Cities entirely ruin'd, and not
a Hou&s;e left &s;tanding. And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no
more regard to their Salvation, than if their Souls
and Bodies died together, and were uncapable of
eternal Rewards or Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> undoubtedly have an Obligation of
Duty upon 'em to in&s;truct them in the Doctrine of
Chri&s;t; but they are &s;o ignorant them&s;elves, that
'tis not much to be wonder'd at, if they take no care
to inform others. I knew one <HI>John Colmenero</HI> in the
I&s;le of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> as dull, as ignorant and whim&s;i|cal
a fellow as one &s;hould meet with, to whom the
care of in&s;tructing the <HI>Indians</HI> in a great City was
committed, tho he &s;carce knew how to make the
&s;ign of the Cro&s;s; and when he was examined about
<PB N="118" REF="69">
the cour&s;e he took to in&s;truct the <HI>Indians,</HI> could
make no other an&s;wer, but that he taught 'em to &s;ay,
<HI>Per &s;ignin &s;anctin Cruces.</HI> By which one may ea&s;ily
gue&s;s at the profound Under&s;tanding of the Man.
And how indeed is it po&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to
teach the <HI>Indians</HI> Chri&s;tianity, and to inform 'em
what is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, when the mo&s;t no|ted
Spani&s;h Lords, and &s;uch as make the greate&s;t fi|gure
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;carce know how many Com|mandments
there are? For they go into <HI>America</HI>
only to gratify their in&s;atiable Covetou&s;ne&s;s. They
are generally given to all &s;orts of Vices; and &s;o im|mode&s;t,
voluptuous and effeminate, that if a ju&s;t
Compari&s;on were made between them and the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
the&s;e latter would be found to have much
more Virtue and Hone&s;ty: For as ignorant and bar|barous
as they be, they are content with one Wife
according to the Laws of Nature, as a nece&s;&s;ary help
to 'em; whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lay a&s;ide all re&s;pect to
the will of their Maker, and take 14 or 15 Women,
or as many as they plea&s;e, to &s;atisfy their bruti&s;h
Pa&s;&s;ions, how oppo&s;ite &s;oever this Plurality of Wives
is to the Law of God. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;carce know what
it is to take away one another's Goods, and live in|nocently
by their Neighbours, without offering 'em
any Violence or Oppre&s;&s;ion. And what thoughts
mu&s;t &s;uch People as the&s;e have of tho&s;e that call
them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, when they &s;ee 'em commit
all manner of Crimes and Villanies; when they
&s;ee 'em guilty of &s;o much Inju&s;tice and Treachery,
and in a word, of all the Abominations of which
men that are left of God, and have no principle of
honour or con&s;cience can be capable? This makes
many <HI>Indians</HI> laugh at the God we wor&s;hip, and
per&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately in their Incredulity. They be|lieve
the God of the Chri&s;tians to be the wor&s;t of
Gods, becau&s;e his Wor&s;hippers are the wor&s;t of
Men.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="69">
As for your Maje&s;ty, they think you are the mo&s;t
cruel and impious Prince in the World, while they
&s;ee the Cruelty and Impiety your Subjects &s;o in&s;o|lently
commit; and they verily believe your Maje|&s;ty
lives upon nothing but human fle&s;h and blood.
Probably this account may very much &s;urprize your
Maje&s;ty, who perhaps have not yet receiv'd &s;uffi|cient
information about the&s;e matters; but this Opi|nion
is of long &s;tanding, and become inveterate
among 'em. I could produce a great many In&s;tances,
of which I have been an Eye-witne&s;s, to convince
you of the Truth of it; but I am afraid of making
your Maje&s;ty too unea&s;y, and of filling the Reader's
mind with too much horror, by reciting &s;uch extra|ordinary
and unparallel'd Stories, which may give
a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of Wonder, that God has &s;o long
defer'd to inflict &s;ome exemplary and terrible Judg|ment
upon <HI>Spain,</HI> to puni&s;h all the Abominations
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have committed in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The
Pretence of &s;ubjecting the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Govern|ment
of <HI>Spain,</HI> is only made to carry on the de&s;ign
of &s;ubjugating 'em to the Dominion of private Men,
who make 'em all their Slaves. One <HI>Spaniards</HI> who
has the Government of a Town or City, does more
mi&s;chief by his vitious and &s;candalous Example,
than a hundred Prie&s;ts and Monks can do good in en|deavouring
to advance Chri&s;tianity by all their
Piety, and the exemplary Sanctity of their Lives.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have the Government of any
place committed to 'em, or have any per&s;onal con|cern,
or &s;pecial intere&s;t in it, they'l be &s;ure to op|pre&s;s
and hara&s;s the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and offer 'em all
the Abu&s;es that can be. And 'tis now become almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible for your Maje&s;ty or your Mini&s;ters to &s;top
the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions, and regulate the&s;e
Di&s;orders; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> terrify the <HI>Indians</HI> by
their threatnings, and &s;ometimes kill 'em to prevent
<PB N="120" REF="70">
their complaints again&s;t 'em: and of this kind of
Cruelty we have many In&s;tances: So that the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> are continually mole&s;ted and hara&s;&s;ed, with|out
any calm Intervals in which to compo&s;e their
Minds, and therefore are not capable of applying
their Thoughts to the con&s;ideration of Divine
things. Their whole Life is &s;pent in Sorrow and
Angui&s;h under their Per&s;ecutions and Torments.
This makes 'em mortally hate your Maje&s;ty, and
abhor the Chri&s;tian Religion; for they can't but
think you impo&s;e a &s;evere Yoke on 'em with intole|rable
Tyranny, that you are the mo&s;t covetous
Prince upon Earth, and that therefore they ought
to leave no &s;tone unturn'd to get clear of your Go|vernment.
The de&s;pair under which they lie, occa|&s;ions
'em to belch out a thou&s;and Cur&s;es again&s;t our
God, attributing all the Mi&s;eries they &s;uffer to him,
whom they accu&s;e of Blindne&s;s, Inju&s;tice, and want
of Compa&s;&s;ion, for not puni&s;hing the Outrages com|mitted
again&s;t 'em under the pretence of obliging
'em to embrace his Religion, and for not cha&s;ti&s;ing
the Impiety of &s;uch as make a boa&s;t of being his
Servants, while they are guilty of the highe&s;t Abo|minations.
This inflames their Zeal towards their
fal&s;e Gods, which they &s;ay are much better than
ours, who has brought all manner of Mi&s;eries upon
'em, whereas their own were the Authors of all
kinds of Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>We &s;hall make it evidently appear to your Ma|je&s;ty,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in about eight and thirty or
forty years have unju&s;tly put to death above twelve
Millions of your Subjects; and what an incredible
damage mu&s;t your Maje&s;ty have farther &s;u&s;tain'd by
the&s;e Ma&s;&s;acres, as they have hinder'd all the&s;e Peo|ple
from multiplying, who would have amounted to
an infinite number, the People of this new World
being very fruitful, and the Climat generally ve|ry
<PB N="121" REF="70">
temperate and plea&s;ant, and con&s;equently very
proper for Generation? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have ma&s;&s;a|cred
and de&s;troy'd all the&s;e Nations, to po&s;&s;e&s;s
them&s;elves of their Country, and to u&s;urp the Go|vernment
of it, &s;o as to have it entirely at their
di&s;po&s;al. And how inju&s;t &s;oever tho&s;e Wars have
been which they have made upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> if the
poor Creatures put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of De|fence,
they cruelly cut their throats without any
di&s;tinction of Quality, Sex or Age: Such as e&s;cape
their Fury they re&s;erve for Slaves, many of whom
they condemn to the Gold or Silver Mines, others
they yoke together like Bea&s;ts to make 'em carry
va&s;t Burdens. They don't much concern them&s;elves
whether the <HI>Indians</HI> live or die, provided they reap
&s;ome advantage by their Labour, and heap up Gold
at any rate in the World. I pa&s;s over in &s;ilence a
great many of the Torments the&s;e poor People have
been made to endure on all occa&s;ions. If any &s;hall
attempt to per&s;wade your Maje&s;ty of the contrary,
we'l undertake to prove what Violence the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
have us'd among the <HI>Indians</HI> by invincible and
undoubted Evidence: And &s;hall not &s;cruple to &s;ay,
that whoever take upon 'em to deny the truth of
the&s;e matters, have in all appearance partaken of
tho&s;e Robberies, or at lea&s;t hope to have a &s;hare of
'em one time or other. For what &s;hew of proba|bility
is there in &s;aying the Contagion of the Air
has &s;o entirely de&s;troy'd the People of a Country of
2500 Leagues extent, that there's &s;carce a Man to
be found?</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who know no other God but their
Intere&s;t, have &s;ullied the Reputation of the poor <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
with the mo&s;t odious Stain that can be imagin'd,
in accu&s;ing 'em of being addicted to an infamous
and abominable Sin again&s;t Nature; a Calumny as
ill contriv'd as 'tis unju&s;t. For that Crime has never
<PB N="122" REF="71">
been heard of in the I&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;paniola, St. John,
Cuba,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which have been very populous.
This I can &s;peak with a&s;&s;urance, as knowing it to be
true, becau&s;e I took care to inform my &s;elf of it
as &s;oon as I came a&s;hore in the new World. Nor
is it &s;o much as known what this Vice is in all <HI>Peru:</HI>
not one Man has ever been found guilty of it in the
whole Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan;</HI> and the like may be
a&s;&s;erted in general of other Countries of <HI>America:</HI>
Only 'tis &s;aid, that in &s;ome very remote parts of
it there are &s;ome People addicted to this mon&s;trous
Crime: But is it rea&s;onable for this to accu&s;e the
whole new World, and to ca&s;t an everla&s;ting Re|proach
on &s;o many different Nations? We mu&s;t &s;ay
the &s;ame of another Enormity charg'd upon the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
namely their eating of Human Fle&s;h. There
are indeed in &s;ome particular places a &s;ort of Men
&s;o barbarous that they eat their own kind; but 'tis
very inju&s;t to take occa&s;ion from this to report the
&s;ame of all <HI>America</HI> in general. Another pretence
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;e, by which to ju&s;tify their ill Carriage
towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> is their Idolatry; as if it did
not belong to God rather than to them, to puni&s;h
tho&s;e that offend him by &s;uch abominable Wor&s;hip
when he &s;ees meet.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Lands and Territories they po&s;&s;e&s;s are
not under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor are
the <HI>Indians</HI> oblig'd to own any other Governors than
their lawful and natural Soveraigns. Our Ance&s;tors
before they were in&s;tructed in the Doctrine of
Chri&s;tianity, were buried in the gro&s;s darkne&s;s of
Idolatry as well as the <HI>Indians.</HI> And before the
coming of Chri&s;t, all the Nations of the World in
general were guilty of that Crime. But that which
evidently proves the Minds of the <HI>Indians</HI> to be ve|ry
&s;u&s;ceptible of our Religion, is the Mildne&s;s, Hu|mility
and Courte&s;y they at fir&s;t expre&s;s'd to the
<PB N="123" REF="71">
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the patience wherewith they have
&s;ince undergone their Cruelties.</P>
<P>'Tis a mo&s;t inexcu&s;able piece of Wickedne&s;s in
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they have made u&s;e of all the
Ob&s;tructions they could, and that deliberately, to
hinder the <HI>Indians</HI> from imbracing the Chri&s;tian
Faith; they have driven away all the Monks that
came into the <HI>Indies</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel, from tho&s;e
places where they had power enough to do it, be|cau&s;e
they did not care the&s;e Religious Per&s;ons
&s;hould be Witne&s;&s;es of the Tyranny and Cruelty
they exercis'd on the poor People. They have even
debauch'd the <HI>Indians</HI> by the ill Example they have
&s;et 'em, and taught 'em a great many Vices they
never heard of before they conver&s;ed with the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;uch as Oaths and Bla&s;phemies again&s;t the
Name of Chri&s;t, the Practice of Extortion, Lying,
and many other Sins that &s;eem'd oppo&s;ite to the
&s;weet and peaceable Temper of the&s;e People: So
that to leave the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> under their Govern|ment,
is vi&s;ibly to expo&s;e 'em to utter De&s;truction,
and to make 'em mi&s;erable both in Soul and Body.</P>
<P>King <HI>Ferdinando</HI> was &s;o far impos'd on by the Ar|tifices
of &s;ome &s;elf-intere&s;ted Men, as to give 'em
leave to tran&s;port the Inhabitants of the <HI>Lucay</HI>-I&s;lands
into <HI>Hi&s;paniola:</HI> the&s;e People were forc'd out
of their Hou&s;es, and out of their Country, in pur|&s;uance
of this Grant, which was &s;ubtily obtain'd,
and occa&s;ion'd the de&s;truction of above a hundred
thou&s;and People; &s;o that there now remain but
eleven of 'em in fifty I&s;lands, &s;ome of which are
bigger than the <HI>Canaries,</HI> that were well &s;tor'd with
People. And this I can affirm on my own know|ledg,
if your Maje&s;ty could have &s;een the Ravages
and Ma&s;&s;acres that have been committed in the <HI>Lucay</HI>
I&s;lands, you would have been pierc'd with the mo&s;t
lively &s;entiments of Compa&s;&s;ion; and then I &s;hould
<PB N="124" REF="72">
have been afraid to incommode your Maje&s;ty by re|viving
the memory of that Tyranny, in giving an
exact Recital of it. We have taken notice above of
the inju&s;t Wars the <HI>Spaniards</HI> formerly rais'd again&s;t
the <HI>Indians;</HI> we have &s;hewn how they ma&s;&s;acred 'em
again&s;t all Law and Equity, how cruelly they de|priv'd
'em of their Children, their Parents, and
Friends; how they have laid wa&s;te one of the fine&s;t
Countries in the World, and render'd it in a man|ner
de&s;titute of Inhabitants. This Barbarity makes
the Earth groan, the Angels lament the&s;e Mi&s;eries:
And God him&s;elf has given us to know by the Judg|ments
he has inflicted on us, how much the&s;e inju&s;t
and violent Actions di&s;plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken from the <HI>Indians</HI> all
they had; they make 'em work till they &s;pit Blood,
they expo&s;e 'em to all &s;orts of Hard&s;hips, and ex|act
intolerable Tasks of 'em; and, which is yet more
horrible, after all they load 'em with heavy Blows,
beating, whipping and tormenting 'em with the ut|mo&s;t
Cruelty. To give up the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Go|vernment
and Tyranny of the&s;e Men, is as great a
madne&s;s, as to give Children into the hands of Men
that are acted by a raging Phrenzy, and have
Knives and Daggers ready in their hands to cut their
Throats; or to &s;acrifice Men to the fury of their
&s;worn Enemies, who have long entertain'd the de&s;ire
of Revenge, and form'd a de&s;ign to murder 'em; or
to expo&s;e a young beautiful Virgin to the Di&s;cretion
of an impudent Ravi&s;her. Who in &s;uch a conjuncture,
without the interpo&s;ition of &s;pecial Grace, would
abandon him&s;elf to the Conduct of his Pa&s;&s;ions?
In a word, it would be the &s;ame thing as to give 'em
up to &s;o many wild Bulls, Wolves, Lions and Tigers,
when inrag'd with pre&s;&s;ing Hunger: for all the Pro|hibitions
that &s;hould be given the&s;e wild Bea&s;ts not
to touch &s;uch as are expos'd to their fury, would
<PB N="125" REF="72">
have ju&s;t the &s;ame effect to prevent 'em from being
devour'd, as any Charge that can be given the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
to hinder 'em from murdering the <HI>Indians</HI> to
po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their Gold and Silver. We
dare a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty after the long Ob&s;ervation
we have made of the&s;e matters, that if your Ma|je&s;ty
&s;hould order a Gibbet to be &s;et up at every
<HI>Spaniard</HI>'s door, and &s;hould &s;wear upon your Crown,
that you would cau&s;e every Man to be hang'd that
&s;hould kill or offer any con&s;iderable Injury to the
<HI>Indians</HI> to get their Riches; this would not be an
effectual Remedy to the&s;e Di&s;orders, if your Ma|je&s;ty
gave 'em any Authority or Power over
'em either directly or indirectly. The &s;ame occa|&s;ions
of doing mi&s;chief would &s;till pre&s;ent, and
defeat all the Prohibitions that could be made, and
all the Puni&s;hments that could be us'd to terrify
'em.</P>
<P>Nor are the poor <HI>Indians</HI> expos'd only to be made
Slaves by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but &s;uffer abundance of Op|pre&s;&s;ion
from a cruel Tyrant, that has the Govern|ment
of each Town or City, who has a &s;evere Eye
over 'em, to &s;ee how they acquit them&s;elves of
their Labors, and perform the Tasks impos'd on 'em.
His bu&s;ine&s;s is to plague and torment 'em &s;o many
different ways, that their Sufferings are almo&s;t be|yond
compari&s;on; he beats 'em with Cudgels, tears
their Fle&s;h with Whips, and cau&s;es burning drops
of Fat to be di&s;till'd on their naked Bodies. He is
continually exerci&s;ing his Invention in contriving
new Tortures, he violates their Wives, takes away
their Turkeys, which they count one of their great|e&s;t
Trea&s;ures; the&s;e Fowls &s;erve him to make Pre|&s;ents
to the General, who is &s;uperior to all the&s;e
petty Tyrants. But 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give a parti|cular
de&s;cription of all the Puni&s;hments the&s;e poor
Wretches endure; and after all to &s;top their Com|plaints,
<PB N="126" REF="73">
they threaten to accu&s;e 'em of Idolatry.
Thus the poor <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;ubject to the Authority
of &s;everal different Powers, to your Maje&s;ty, to their
<HI>Cacique,</HI> and to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, be&s;ides twen|ty
other little Tyrants, de&s;titute of Rea&s;on, Honor
and Con&s;cience, who commit all &s;orts of Outrages;
and likewi&s;e the <HI>Moors</HI> whom the chief Tyrant em|ploys
to rob and oppre&s;s the poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis much to be fear'd that Almighty God will
make <HI>Spain</HI> feel &s;ome extraordinary marks of his
Di&s;plea&s;ure and Indignation for the&s;e enormous
Crimes: nay, there appear already &s;ome tokens of
the Divine Anger again&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation, for
the Di&s;orders and Deva&s;tations made by &s;ome in the
new World: for tho God had laid up &s;uch quanti|ties
of Trea&s;ure there, that it may be &s;aid neither
<HI>Solomon</HI> nor any other Prince ever po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a &s;tock
of Gold and Silver comparable to that which the
People of the&s;e va&s;t Regions enjoy'd; yet they have
bin &s;o pillag'd, that now there's little remaining
among 'em: But that which is more unaccountable
is, that there's &s;carce any of that Silver now to be
found, that was &s;o common in <HI>America</HI> when the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> fir&s;t di&s;cover'd it. This makes every thing
extraordinary &s;carce there, &s;o that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
reduc'd to extreme Poverty and Indigence.</P>
<P>All the while <HI>Lar&eacute;s</HI> govern'd the <HI>Indies,</HI> there was
no more care taken to in&s;til the Principles of
Chri&s;tianity into the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and to put 'em
in the way of Salvation, than if they had no Souls
to &s;ave. This General applied him&s;elf only to plun|der
the great Cities, and would give a hundred <HI>In|dians</HI>
to one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and fifty to another, as he
had more or le&s;s re&s;pect for 'em. He made no
di&s;tinction of Age or Condition, but promi&s;cuou&s;ly
di&s;tributed old Men, and big bellied Women, as well
as others, Per&s;ons of Eminency and Princes as well
<PB N="127" REF="73">
as the common People, to oblige his Favorites; as
if the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were his ab&s;olute Property. Their
new Ma&s;ters made 'em work in the Gold Mines, or
employ'd 'em in any other Service they pleas'd;
and without regard to their Rank or Quality, ob|lig'd
'em to bear this &s;lavi&s;h Yoke till they dy'd.</P>
<P>This Governor &s;uffer'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to confine
eighty thou&s;and of 'em in the Mines, who were all
married Men, while their de&s;olate Wives were forc'd
to labor in the Villages, in digging the ground,
making Ditches, and throwing up Banks, a &s;ort of
work fit only for the &s;tronge&s;t Men, and the rather
becau&s;e they had neither Shovels nor other In&s;tru|ments
proper for their bu&s;ine&s;s. In other places
they put 'em upon &s;pinning and other works of that
kind, which they found would turn to account; and
would &s;ometimes keep Husbands and Wives from
&s;eeing one another a whole year together; and when
they met after this long &s;eparation, they were often
&s;o fatigued, and con&s;um'd with Hunger and Labor,
that they were incapable of Multiplication. Some|times
the Children dy'd for want of Su&s;tenance,
their Mothers Milk being exhau&s;ted with hard La|bor
and Hunger; by this means there dy'd &s;even
thou&s;and Infants in the &s;pace of three months in the
I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> of which I was an Eye-witne&s;s. Some
of the Women tran&s;ported with de&s;pair &s;trangl'd
their own Children; others that were with Child
took poi&s;onous Herbs to de&s;troy their Fruit. Thus
the Men dy'd with hard&s;hip in the Mines, and the
Women in the Villages; &s;o that the whole Country
became de&s;ert in a little time, becau&s;e the Women
ceas'd to bring forth Children into the World.</P>
<P>This Governor deliver'd up all the <HI>Indians</HI> to the
Di&s;cretion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;uffer'd 'em to treat
'em with all the Rigor and Severity they pleas'd,
and to oppre&s;s 'em with the harde&s;t Labor they
<PB N="128" REF="74">
could. They employ'd Men to cha&s;ti&s;e 'em that
were more &s;avage and barbarous than Tygers, the&s;e
&s;courg'd and beat 'em mo&s;t unmercifully, and gave
them all the ill Treatment they could devi&s;e; they
would never di&s;cover the lea&s;t &s;ign of Kindne&s;s or
Pity, but always &s;hew'd them&s;elves au&s;tere and bar|barou&s;ly
cruel. It would be very inhuman to treat
the <HI>Moors</HI> them&s;elves after this manner, tho they
are &s;o very cruel to the Chri&s;tians, and do 'em all the
mi&s;chief they can, when they have the A&s;cendent
over 'em. But the <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally a good-humour'd,
ea&s;y, peaceable, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and tractable
&s;ort of People. Some of 'em have by the many
Mi&s;eries they &s;uffer'd, been driven to de&s;pair of any
mitigation of 'em, and therefore fled into the Moun|tains,
where they expected Death every moment.
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> to hinder 'em from flying after this
manner, appointed a bloody Fellow to make it his
whole bu&s;ine&s;s to hunt out the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Refugees up|on
the Mountains. The Governor be&s;ides e&s;tabli&s;h'd
a &s;ort of Officers in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cities of great Con|&s;ideration
and Authority, whom he call'd Vi&s;itors;
to each of the&s;e he gave a hundred <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;erve
him, be&s;ides his ordinary Dome&s;ticks, the better to
&s;upport his Dignity. He cho&s;e &s;uch to this Office
as had &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves by their Cruelty. When
the <HI>Alquazils</HI> pre&s;ented the <HI>Indians</HI> they found on the
Mountains to the&s;e Vi&s;itors, there were Per&s;ons
&s;uborn'd and in&s;tructed to accu&s;e 'em after this
manner; <HI>This Indian is a lazy Dog, that fled into the
Mountains to avoid Work, therefore I de&s;ire he may
be cha&s;tiz'd as he de&s;erves.</HI> After the giving of
this Evidence, the Vi&s;itor us'd to cau&s;e the poor
<HI>Indian</HI> to be tied to a Stake, and beat with a tarr'd
Rope, which the Seamen call a Salt-Eel, and indeed
is like a Rod of Iron, till the Blood would &s;tart out
in I know not how many parts of his Body, and the
<PB N="129" REF="74">
poor Creature would lie for dead upon the place.
God is witne&s;s of all the Cruelties the&s;e mi&s;erable
Innocents have endur'd: 'Tis not po&s;&s;ible to re|count
the hundredth part of what I have &s;een with
my own Eyes. A man had need have a Body of
Iron to undergo the Labor they endure in getting
Gold out of the Mines. They mu&s;t delve and &s;earch
a thou&s;and times over in the bowels of the Moun|tains,
till they dig 'em down from top to bottom;
they mu&s;t work the very Rocks hollow. After this
the Gold mu&s;t be wa&s;h'd in &s;ome River, and the
poor Creatures that do this work mu&s;t be perpe|tually
in the Water, which gradually alters and
&s;poils the Con&s;titution of their Bodies; and if the
Mines happen to be full of Water, they are forc'd
to empty 'em. That your Maje&s;ty may the better
judg of the Labor and Toil they &s;uffer in the Gold
Mines, your Maje&s;ty may plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that the
Pagan Emperors accounted this the wor&s;t and mo&s;t
intolerable Puni&s;hment to inflict on the Martyrs,
next to Death it &s;elf. The <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;ometimes
kept a whole year in the&s;e Mines: but &s;ince the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
have ob&s;erv'd, that it kill'd mo&s;t of 'em to
keep 'em there &s;o long together, becau&s;e their Bo|dies
were uncapable of &s;u&s;taining the Fatigues of
&s;uch a tedious and continual Labor, they re&s;olv'd to
make 'em work only for the &s;pace of five months
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and then to give 'em a re&s;pite of forty
days, wherein they employ'd 'em in melting Gold.
But this pretended Re&s;t did 'em no great good, for
they were not much le&s;s incommoded during this
time than before, being employ'd in other very
trouble&s;om kinds of Work. The <HI>Indians</HI> don't
know what Holy-days are; for they work as hard
and as long on tho&s;e days as at other times. Nor
have they a &s;ufficiency of Bread allow'd 'em; and
what they have is a very ordinary &s;ort, that has
<PB N="130" REF="75">
not much &s;trength in it, being made of Roots and
Ca&s;&s;ave; &s;o that if they don't eat Fle&s;h or Fi&s;h with
it, it yields very little Nouri&s;hment. They like|wi&s;e
give 'em a &s;ort of Pepper that grows in the
Country, and looks much like a dry'd Grape.
Tho&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> that pretend to keep their Slaves
extraordinary well, di&s;tribute a Porker every week
among fifty <HI>Indians;</HI> but he that pre&s;ides over 'em
at the Mine keeps one half of it for his &s;hare, and
gives them the other, which is but every one a bit.
Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o wretchedly covetous,
that they &s;end their Slaves into the Fields and Moun|tains
to feed upon what Fruit they can find, and
then oblige 'em to work two or three days without
giving 'em any thing to eat. Your Maje&s;ty may
ea&s;ily imagine, that &s;uch kind of Food can't po&s;&s;ibly
&s;u&s;tain their weak and langui&s;hing Bodies, that are
continually enfeebled and exhau&s;ted with hard La|bor;
or that the&s;e poor Creatures that are mace|rated
with all manner of Hard&s;hip and Fatigue,
without any re&s;t, or relaxation of their Mi&s;ery, can
live long under the pre&s;&s;ures of &s;o cruel a Servi|tude.</P>
<P>The abovemention'd Governor at la&s;t order'd
they &s;hould have Wages di&s;tributed among 'em, <HI>viz.</HI>
that three<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Blanc is about the value of a Half-penny.</NOTE> Blancs &s;hould be given each of 'em to
&s;pend every two days, as the Reward of the hard
Labors they exacted of 'em. This was only to mock
the poor Wretches, for this Mony would &s;carce
buy 'em the lea&s;t Trifle. But for many years they
had nothing at all given 'em, yet this does not
di&s;turb 'em &s;o much as want of Victuals; for there
is nothing in the world they &s;o much de&s;ire as to
eat well, in&s;omuch that if they could but &s;atisfy
them&s;elves with one good Meal, they would after|wards
<PB N="131" REF="75">
be content to die. This Governor depriv'd
'em of all the liberty they enjoy'd, and &s;uffer'd the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to in&s;lave 'em, and treat 'em as &s;everely
as they pleas'd; and indeed the ill u&s;age they have
met with is beyond what the Mind of man can ima|gine.
They have not the liberty to di&s;po&s;e of any
thing they have: The condition of Bea&s;ts is prefera|ble
to theirs, for the&s;e are at lea&s;t &s;ometimes turn'd
loo&s;e to fill their Bellies with Gra&s;s in the fields, and
have a little ea&s;e and liberty; whereas the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> have &s;carce any time of re&s;t allow'd 'em,
but are con&s;train'd to do whatever the covetous
<HI>Spaniards</HI> command 'em. They lead 'em to work
like Bea&s;ts of Burden rather than Men. If at any
time they give 'em leave to go home to take a little
Repo&s;e, they neither find their Wives nor Children
there, nor any thing to eat, and have no other re|lief
than to lay them&s;elves down and die. The in|credible
Fatigue they undergo wears 'em out the
&s;ooner, becau&s;e they are naturally of a weak and
tender Con&s;titution; and when they are &s;ick and
faint, they are &s;till made to work without any Com|pa&s;&s;ion:
nay, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o cruel as to beat
and abu&s;e 'em when they are ju&s;t ready to die, calling
'em lazy Ra&s;cals, as if they refus'd to work, and
feign'd them&s;elves &s;ick, merely out of Idlene&s;s. At
la&s;t when they &s;ee their Illne&s;s increa&s;e to that de|gree,
that they can expect no more Service of 'em,
they &s;end 'em home, giving 'em &s;ix or &s;even great
Roots, almo&s;t like Turnips, with a &s;mall quantity
of Ca&s;&s;ave, to carry 'em a journey of fifty or &s;ixty
Leagues; &s;o that they often mi&s;erably langui&s;h and
die before they have proceeded far on their way:
we often found a great many of 'em dead on the
Roads, others we found ready to expire, and others
by their Groans and Sighs gave us to under&s;tand
their extreme Hunger. When the Governor had
<PB N="132" REF="76">
not a &s;ufficient number of Men for the Works in
the Mines, he &s;upplied the places of them that were
releas'd by death, by ca&s;ting Lots for others, which
method was ob&s;erv'd once a year.</P>
<P>When he enter'd into the Continent, he came
like a &s;weeping Judgment of God, or as a Wolf
among Sheep: He committed &s;o many Robberies,
Ma&s;&s;acres and Cruelties, depopulated and de&s;troy'd
&s;o many Towns and Cities, giving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> li|berty
to do what they pleas'd, that no Hi&s;tory can
parallel his Barbarity: He robb'd both the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> and his Subjects, without being ever call'd to
account for it; he left above forty Leagues of a
very populous and fertil Country to the di&s;cretion
or rather fury of his Soldiers: All that plea&s;ant
Tract of Ground from <HI>Daria</HI> where he landed to
<HI>Nicaraqua</HI> was reduc'd to the utmo&s;t De&s;olation;
&s;o that five or &s;ix Millions of Mony will not re|pair
the Damage done there. This vile and cruel
Man abandon'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Tyranny of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> which was the &s;ource and original Cau&s;e
of all the Per&s;ecutions under which tho&s;e poor Peo|ple
have &s;ince groan'd, and of all the Deva&s;tations
that <HI>America</HI> has &s;uffer'd wherever the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have &s;et their feet. This Contagion by degrees
&s;pread far and near; &s;o that this General by let|ting
loo&s;e his Soldiers after this licentious manner,
has occa&s;ion'd the ruin of many millions of Men,
and the de&s;olation of divers great Kingdoms that
were &s;ubjected to your Maje&s;ty's Dominion. If we
&s;ay the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have de&s;troy'd &s;even Kingdoms
bigger than that of <HI>Spain,</HI> we can &s;peak it with
confidence, as knowing it to be true, and having
known the time when they were fill'd with multi|tudes
of People, tho now there are &s;carce any to
be found, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having extirpated the Peo|ple
of the&s;e large Kingdoms, and left the Walls
<PB N="133" REF="76">
and Hou&s;es of the Towns and Cities without Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty has no fix'd and con&s;tant Revenue
in the <HI>Indies;</HI> your Effects are like Leaves, which
when once they fall from the Trees appear no more
till a year after. That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of the ab&s;olute Government of the <HI>Indies</HI> is the
true cau&s;e of this Di&s;order; for the number of the
<HI>Indians</HI> every day decrea&s;ing, your Maje&s;ty's Re|venues
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily receive a proportionable di|minution.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> is in great danger to be
invaded by Foreign Nations, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Moors</HI>
and <HI>Turks,</HI> who perhaps may one day be in a con|dition
to de&s;troy it: For God is a ju&s;t Judg, and
cannot look upon the Villanies and Oppre&s;&s;ions, the
Robberies and Murders of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
without indignation. All the Nations of this new
World, who were created (as well as his others) af|ter
the likene&s;s and image of God, and ran|&s;om'd
by the precious Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have
been unju&s;tly and cruelly tormented and per&s;ecuted
by 'em; they have made horrible &s;laughters among
'em to requite the many Kindne&s;&s;es they heap'd on
'em with all imaginable Freedom and Civility. And
that which &s;till aggravates their Crimes the more,
and mu&s;t needs farther provoke the Divine Di&s;plea|&s;ure,
is, that God had made choice of <HI>Spain</HI> to car|ry
his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to bring
many populous Nations to the knowledg of him&s;elf;
for which if they had fallen in with his De&s;igns, he
would, be&s;ides tho&s;e eternal Rewards re&s;erv'd for
'em, have given into their hands many good and
fruitful Countries, abounding with Mines of Gold
and Silver, Diamonds and other precious Stones
and Pearls; in a word, with all &s;orts of temporal
Ble&s;&s;ings, beyond what any one can imagine, unle&s;s
<PB N="134" REF="77">
&s;uch as have &s;een it with their own eyes. And 'tis
to be remark'd that God u&s;ually ob&s;erves this Rule
in the execution of his Judgments, to proportionate
his Penalties to the Crimes committed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Outrages and Cruelties the&s;e innocent People
have felt are &s;o horrid and notorious, that their
Tears and Groans and Blood, the cry of which has
reach'd the Throne of God, will undoubtedly draw
down Vengeance on tho&s;e that have offer'd all this
violence to their Per&s;ons, and plunder'd 'em of their
E&s;tates. The Report of the&s;e Cruelties is &s;pread
through the whole World, and has been carried even
to the mo&s;t barbarous Nations, and has made 'em ab|hor
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and conceive a mortal hatred a|gain&s;t
'em: A hatred which extends to the Per&s;on of
our King, as well as Subjects, and is extremely
prejudicial to the whole Nation in general.</P>
<P>None can be &s;o ignorant as not to fore&s;ee what
Mi&s;chiefs the De&s;olations in <HI>America</HI> are like to
bring upon <HI>Spain;</HI> and &s;ucceeding Generations will
be but too much convinc'd of the truth of this Pro|phecy:
And if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;till &s;uffers the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to domineer and tyrannize as they have hi|therto
done in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and makes not effectual
provi&s;ion by proper Edicts to &s;top the Cour&s;e of the
many Mi&s;eries the People of this New World un|dergo,
tho&s;e Countries will in a little time be totally
depopulated. And God will undoubtedly make all
<HI>Spain</HI> feel the Effects of his Wrath in puni&s;hing &s;uch
Crimes as the&s;e; &s;ince the whole Scripture is full of
Threatnings, and plain In&s;tances of the Judgments
of God on &s;uch as have been acce&s;&s;ory to the Sins of
others by permitting them.</P>

and drawn up thirty Propo&s;itions, without giving

becau&s;e they are all certain and evident, and partly
becau&s;e I was much urg'd to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s,
and to &s;end them to your Maje&s;ty; which I have ac|compli&s;h'd
in the fear of God, and according to
the dictates of my Con&s;cience, with a &s;trict regard
to Truth.</P>
<P>Since the de&s;ire I have of being &s;erviceable to God
daily increa&s;es, I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to refute
the Impo&s;tures and Calumnies of &s;ome ill-de&s;igning
Per&s;ons, who wilfully &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the
Truth, becau&s;e 'tis directly oppo&s;ite to the De&s;igns
and Projects they have form'd. They flatter them|&s;elves,
that under the fal&s;e pretext of &s;erving the
Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> who are ordinarily of a &s;weet and
benign temper, and ready to judg of others by the
good Sentiments they find in them&s;elves; I &s;ay, they
flatter them&s;elves that they &s;hall &s;till be able to im|po&s;e

to bring 'em into the &s;nares they have laid for 'em.
It was the complaint of <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of
<PB N="136" REF="78">
<HI>E&s;ther,</HI> that corrupt and vicious Subjects alter'd the
good di&s;po&s;ition of Princes, and betray'd 'em into
Exce&s;&s;es, that occa&s;ion'd the ruin of whole King|doms
and their Kings together. 'Tis for this rea|&s;on,
<HI>Great Sir,</HI> I have briefly drawn up the&s;e Propo|&s;itions,
to &s;et this matter before you in a clear light.
This I have done to di&s;charge my own Con&s;cience,
and that I might the better an&s;wer the Obligations of
that Mini&s;try wherewith God has entru&s;ted me. I
find my &s;elf growing old, being advanc'd to the 50<HI>th</HI>
year of my age; and the great acquaintance I have
had with the Affairs of <HI>America,</HI> has furni&s;h'd me with
a very di&s;tinct knowledg of 'em; &s;o that my circum|&s;tances
render me in &s;ome re&s;pects more capable
than others of giving proper Advice to tho&s;e that
are propos'd for the Government of <HI>America,</HI> that
they may know how to put a period to its Mi&s;e|ries:
for I have no other intention or de&s;ire in this
matter, than that of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Inju&s;tice and
Cruelty that has &s;o long hara&s;s'd the Inhabitants of
the New World.</P>
<P>They that endeavour to cro&s;s my good De&s;ign
with the greate&s;t warmth, and deck them&s;elves with
a fal&s;e appearace of zeal and affection to your Ma|je&s;ty,
tho at the bottom they have no regard either
to truth or ju&s;tice, take care to hide their De&s;igns
under the &s;pecious colour of promoting your Ma|je&s;ty's
Service and Intere&s;t, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing your
Maje&s;tiy's Right and Title to <HI>America,</HI> while indeed
all they do is directly contrary to your Maje&s;ty's Ser|vice,
whether in re&s;pect of Spirituals or Temporals.
And I believe all intelligent Chri&s;tians, that have a
true zeal for their Religion, will be of this opinion,
when I have made the Errors and Extravagancies of
tho&s;e that oppo&s;e my Sentiments appear; for the&s;e
Gentlemen hand over head maintain that the Kings

a Title to the Government of <HI>America</HI> by
force of Arms, after the &s;ame manner that <HI>Nim|rod,</HI>
who was the fir&s;t mighty Hunter (as the
Scripture expre&s;ly ob&s;erves) and fir&s;t began to
tyrannize over Men, laid the foundation of his

antient Romans extended the bounds of their Em|pire;
or ju&s;t as the Turks to this day oppre&s;s the
Chri&s;tians, and invade their Territories. All the
World may ea&s;ily perceive that they who rea&s;on thus,
are ignorant of the true Intere&s;t of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and &s;hamefully violate all the Rules of Ju&s;tice. To
prove what they advance, they add new Errors to their
fir&s;t Extravagancies, till they &s;hew by the wretched
Maxims they expo&s;e, that they have neither Honor
nor Chri&s;tianity. For it often falls out, that while
they who wander from the Tract of Truth and Vir|tue,
go about to excu&s;e the Errors they have made,
they fall into other Mi&s;takes that are &s;till more gro&s;s
and dangerous.</P>
<P>There are others of 'em who produce Titles that
appear to be &s;omewhat better founded, and alledg

<HEAD>A Di&s;pute between Don Bartholomew de La&s;-Ca&s;as,
Bi&s;hop of Chiapa, and Dr. Sepulueda.</HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Sepulueda,</HI> at the in&s;tigation of &s;ome <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
who had committed great Ravages in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> wrote a very elegant Book in Latin in the
form of Dialogues, which contain'd principally two
Conclu&s;ions, namely, that the Wars of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in the <HI>Indies</HI> were very ju&s;t, and that they might
lawfully &s;ubjugate the People of this new World;
and that the <HI>Indians</HI> were oblig'd to &s;ubmit to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and acquie&s;ce in their Government, be|cau&s;e
the&s;e are more wi&s;e and prudent than the
others. And in ca&s;e they refu&s;e to &s;ubmit, this
Doctor a&s;&s;erts, that they may be con&s;train'd to it
by force of Arms. The&s;e are the two Points that
have occa&s;ion'd the ruin of incredible numbers of
<HI>Indians;</HI> &s;o that the Country is almo&s;t entirely un|peopled
for the &s;pace of two thou&s;and Leagues,
where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have left the marks of their
boundle&s;s Cruelty. This Doctor, to give &s;ome co|lor
and &s;hew of Truth to his Rea&s;ons, declar'd that
he had no other de&s;ign in writing than that of ju&s;ti|fying
the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Title to the <HI>Indies.</HI> He
pre&s;ented his Book to the Royal Council, and was
very importunate to obtain leave to print it, which
was &s;everal times refus'd; after which he ap|plied
him&s;elf to &s;ome of his Friends, who were in
the Emperor's Court, to patronize this Work. The
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> being well inform'd of the &s;teps
this Doctor made, with all his might oppos'd the
Impre&s;&s;ion of his Book, plainly demon&s;trating what
ill Con&s;equences the publication of it might pro|duce.
The Members of the King's Council per|ceiving
<PB N="151" REF="85">
this matter was purely Theological, re&s;olv'd
to di&s;mi&s;s it to the Univer&s;ities of <HI>Salamanca</HI> and
<HI>Alcala,</HI> de&s;iring them to make a thorow Examina|tion
of this Treati&s;e, to &s;ee if it contain'd any thing
that might ju&s;tly ob&s;truct the printing of it. The&s;e
two Univer&s;ities after they had accuratly examin'd
it, declar'd that it was not fit to be printed, as
containing un&s;ound Doctrine. The Doctor now
de&s;pairing of &s;eeing his Book obtain in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ent
it to <HI>Rome,</HI> earne&s;tly recommending it to the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Segovia,</HI> who was one of his particular Friends.
When it was printed, it was prohibited by the Em|peror's
expre&s;s Order, who caus'd the Copies to be
&s;eiz'd, forbidding any of 'em to be &s;old in <HI>Spain:</HI>
but becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent divers Co|pies
in the vulgar Language from being &s;pread

him&s;elf oblig'd to refute this Book in defence of

Doctrine it contain'd, being accommodated
to open a door to all manner of Di&s;orders. Dr. <HI>Se|pulueda</HI>

<P>YOU have bin pleas'd to order me to give a
&s;uccinct and &s;ummary account of the Di&s;pute
maintain'd between the famous Dr. <HI>Sepulueda,</HI> and
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> without adding any thing of
my own, or troubling my &s;elf to &s;eek other Rea&s;ons
<PB N="152" REF="86">
to &s;upport the Sentiments of either of 'em. The Point
about which you de&s;ire to be inform'd, is in general
what method ought to be us'd for the publication of
the Catholic Faith in the new World, which has bin
lately di&s;cover'd by the permi&s;&s;ion of God, and how
the Emperor may &s;ubject tho&s;e Nations to his Go|vernment
without offending his Con&s;cience, in con|forming
him&s;elf entirely to the Bull of Pope <HI>Alex|ander.</HI>
'Tis fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to enquire whether the
Emperor may ju&s;tly make War with the <HI>Indians</HI>
before the Faith of the Go&s;pel be preach'd to 'em;
and whether the&s;e People will be in any condition to
receive the Light of the Go&s;pel, after they have
bin &s;ubdu'd by force of Arms; whether they will
be more tractable and docil, and better di&s;pos'd to
receive the Impre&s;&s;ions de&s;ign'd to be given, &s;o as to
reject their Errors, and embrace the Doctrine of
the Go&s;pel. Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> maintains, that this War
is not only allowable and lawful, but nece&s;&s;ary.
The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> is of the contrary Opinion,
and pretends that this War is unju&s;t, and an invin|cible
Ob&s;tacle to the propagation of the Faith in the
<HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sepulueda</HI> &s;upports his Opinion by four principal
Arguments: The fir&s;t is founded on the enormous
Crimes of which the <HI>Indians</HI> have bin, and are eve|ry
day guilty, e&s;pecially their Idolatry, and their
Sins again&s;t Nature. His &s;econd Rea&s;on is taken
from their Barbarity and Ignorance, which may be
reform'd under the Government of a People &s;o in|telligent
and polite as the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> His third
Rea&s;on re&s;pects the facility he &s;uppo&s;es of publi&s;h|ing
the Chri&s;tian Faith to the <HI>Indians</HI> when they are
once &s;ubdu'd. His fourth Argument is taken from
the cruel Treatment the <HI>Indians</HI> give one another, in
that they offer human Sacrifices to their fal&s;e Gods.
He confirms his fir&s;t Rea&s;on three ways: 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> By
<PB N="153" REF="86">
Examples and Authorities taken out of the holy
Scripture. 2<HI>dly.</HI> By the Suffrage of Doctors and
Canoni&s;ts. 3<HI>dly.</HI> By a particular account of the
gro&s;s Crimes which the <HI>Indians</HI> commit. He cites
a Pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>Deut.</HI> 20. to explain after what
manner War ought to be made on the <HI>Indians;</HI> the
words are the&s;e: <HI>When thou come&s;t nigh unto a City
to fight again&s;t it, then proclaim Peace unto it. And it
&s;hall be, if it make thee an&s;wer of Peace, and open unto
thee, then it &s;hall be that all the People that is found there|in,
&s;hall be Tributaries unto thee, and they &s;hall &s;erve
thee. And if it will make no Peace with thee, but will
make War again&s;t thee, then thou &s;halt be&s;iege it: And
when the LORD thy God hath deliver'd it into thy
hands, thou &s;halt &s;mite every Male thereof with the
Edg of the Sword:</HI> ver. 10, 11, 12, 13. and <HI>ver. 16.
But of the Cities of the&s;e People which the Lord thy God
doth give thee for an Inheritance, thou &s;halt &s;ave alive
nothing that breatheth.</HI> The Doctor adds, that this
Pa&s;&s;age is not to be &s;trictly taken, and enforc'd a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Indians</HI> with &s;o much &s;everity: tho 'tis al|&s;o
&s;aid, <HI>Thus &s;halt thou do unto all the Cities that are very
far from thee;</HI> by which Pa&s;&s;age the Glo&s;s under&s;tands
tho&s;e of different Religions. From hence he con|cludes,
that we may lawfully declare War again&s;t
tho&s;e Nations that are of a Religion different from
ours.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> an&s;wers him four ways. Fir&s;t, he
&s;ays, it was not to puni&s;h the Sin of Idolatry, that
God commanded the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to make War with
the Gentiles and Infidels: That God was pleas'd to
&s;ingle out preci&s;ely &s;even Nations, the <HI>Canaanites,</HI>
the <HI>Jebu&s;ites,</HI> &amp;c. mentioned in <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
the Land of Promi&s;e bequeathed to <HI>Abraham</HI> and
his Po&s;terity. He allows it to be true, that God de|&s;ign'd
to puni&s;h the Idolatry of tho&s;e Heathen Na|tions,
in giving 'em up to the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> but he &s;ays
<PB N="154" REF="87">
if God's intention had bin only to cha&s;ti&s;e 'em for
their Idolatry, he would al&s;o have puni&s;h'd all the
Nations of the whole World after the &s;ame manner,
&s;eeing they were all polluted with the &s;ame Sin.
Whereas God &s;pecified only the&s;e Nations to be
abandon'd to the Sword of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> to &s;hew
that it was rather to accompli&s;h the Promi&s;e he had
made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> than to puni&s;h the&s;e Idolaters
that he deliver'd 'em into the hands of their Ene|mies.
That God him&s;elf expre&s;ly forbad the <HI>I&s;rae|lites</HI>
to offer any Violence to the <HI>Edomites,</HI> or to the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> who had entertain'd 'em when they were
&s;trangers in their Country.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Luke</HI> 14. where it
is &s;aid, <HI>Compel them to come in,</HI> is not to be under|&s;tood
of an external Con&s;traint by War and Arms,
but ought to be interpreted of internal In&s;piration,
and the Motions which God produces in the Hearts
of Men, either immediatly, or by the Mini&s;tration
of Angels.</P>
<P>In the third place the Bi&s;hop maintains, that Chri&s;|tian
Emperors have never engag'd in War with
Heathen Nations to oblige 'em to renounce Idolatry,
and to induce 'em to imbrace the Chri&s;tian Faith;
that the Wars of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> were purely on a po|litic
account, and that the Pa&s;&s;age of the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;torian, <HI>lib. 10. cap.</HI> 6. is to be under&s;tood
in that &s;en&s;e. That this Prince who was &s;o ani|mated
with Piety, when he &s;ubdued by his Arms the
<HI>Goths, Sarmatians,</HI> and other barbarous Nations, ex|cepted
tho&s;e that &s;ought his Friend&s;hip, and de&s;ir'd
Peace. That becau&s;e he &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the
Divine Commands, God was pleas'd to recompen&s;e
his Virtue in &s;ubjecting all the People of the World
to his Dominion. Be&s;ides, he &s;ays, <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> made
War with the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> becau&s;e they
made incredible Ravage and Spoil wherever they
<PB N="155" REF="87">
came. But when the&s;e barbarous People were at
peace with the Chri&s;tians, and offer'd 'em no Injury,
they were &s;uffer'd to live at quiet.</P>
<P>He adds in the 4<HI>th</HI> place, That if we would do a|ny
good upon Pagans, it mu&s;t be by the power of
good Examples, and not by Violence. He cites to
this purpo&s;e a pa&s;&s;age of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> who &s;ays it
belongs only to men tran&s;ported with Rage, and to
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to u&s;e force again&s;t tho&s;e that are inferior to
'em in Power: that this Father al&s;o condemns &s;uch
as were not able to do the Pagans any hurt, and yet
ra&s;hly offer'd them&s;elves to death, to gain the repu|tation
of Martyrs. He al&s;o quotes a Pa&s;&s;age out of
<HI>Deut. 7. When the Lord thy God &s;hall bring thee into the
Land whither thou goe&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s it,</HI> &amp;c. ver. 1. <HI>Ye
&s;hall de&s;troy their Altars, and break down their Images,
and cut down their Groves, and burn their graven Images
with Fire,</HI> ver. 5. Upon which Pa&s;&s;age he &s;ays St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf after this manner: Many of
the Pagans have Idols in their Fields, mu&s;t we take
upon us to break the&s;e Idols in pieces? 'Tis much
better to endeavour to get 'em out of their Hearts.
When they have embrac'd Chri&s;tianity, and exhort
us them&s;elves to break the&s;e Idols, we &s;hall do it with
plea&s;ure. We mu&s;t in the mean time pray for their
Conver&s;ion, without appearing violent and pa&s;&s;io|nate
again&s;t 'em becau&s;e of their Idolatry: We are
not ignorant where they hide their Idols, and yet
we let 'em alone, becau&s;e God has not given us a
Commi&s;&s;ion to take 'em away without their leave.
When then does God give us leave to take 'em from
them? Not till the owners of the&s;e Idols are become
Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>He farther produces the examples of the Apo&s;tles
and Martyrs, who took no other cour&s;e to overthrow
Idols but by their Doctrine. He grants that indeed
on &s;ome accounts War may be made with Infidels;
<PB N="156" REF="88">
for in&s;tance, if they have violently u&s;urp'd the Lands
of Chri&s;tians, as they have the <HI>Holy-Land;</HI> if they
profane our Churches, break down our Images, and
offer any great outrages to Chri&s;tians, in hatred and
contempt of their Faith: That when the Emperor
<HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> forbad the Heathens to keep their Idols,
it was for fear the Chri&s;tians &s;hould be &s;candaliz'd
by 'em.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, If God &s;everely puni&s;h'd the Crimes of
the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> it does not therefore follow that we
may take upon us to puni&s;h all Infidels for their un|natural
Pollutions: That we are to admire the Judg|ments
of God, but not always to imitate every
thing he does. He &s;ays, we may puni&s;h Infidels if
they bla&s;pheme the Holy Name of God, or di&s;honour
the Saints and the Church; if they openly hinder
the publication of the Faith, and if they ma&s;&s;acre
tho&s;e that preach it: but that it is not lawful to de|clare
War again&s;t 'em merely on the account of their
Idolatry, their unnatural Sins, or any other Crimes
they commit among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And whereas Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> &s;ays, The Indians are
a barbarous People, and born for Slavery: the Bi|&s;hop
of <HI>Chiapa</HI> an&s;wers this Objection, in &s;aying,
That we ought not to make War upon Infidels to
bring 'em to the true Religion, which is only to be
demon&s;trated by genuin Rea&s;ons, that the under|&s;tanding
may be captivated according to the words
of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> That it mu&s;t be a pious Affection to the
Chri&s;tian Faith that will di&s;po&s;e men to embrace
it; and that care ought to be taken that they may
have no aver&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e that preach it; who
therefore ought by their good Examples to engage
the <HI>Indians</HI> to reli&s;h the Doctrine they endeavour to
propagate among 'em: That War is vi&s;ibly contrary
to this end, becau&s;e it fills the minds of tho&s;e Ido|laters
with horror and indignation again&s;t the Chri&s;|tians,
<PB N="157" REF="88">
for bringing &s;o many Mi&s;eries upon 'em; and
that they cannot chu&s;e but think the Law of Chri&s;t
an execrable Doctrine, &s;ince it authorizes (as they
imagin) &s;uch terrible Di&s;orders. The Bi&s;hop con|cludes
in &s;aying, 'tis a mere delu&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert, that
the Wars made again&s;t the&s;e Infidels are not de&s;ign'd
to introduce Chri&s;tianity among 'em by open force,
but only to &s;ubjugate tho&s;e barbarous Nations the
better to di&s;po&s;e 'em to receive the Faith of Chri&s;t
voluntarily. He pretends that this is ill rea&s;oning,
becau&s;e War &s;preads &s;o much terror among tho&s;e
People, that if they afterwards embrace the true
Faith, 'tis to be &s;uppos'd they do it rather out of fear
than love: and that their Neighbours when they hear
what Violence, Spoil, and Ma&s;&s;acres have attended
this War, may probably, to avoid the like Mi&s;chiefs,
blindly embrace the Faith, without knowing what
they do them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> urges for another rea&s;on of War,
that the <HI>Indians</HI> ma&s;&s;acre innocent Per&s;ons, either to
&s;acrifice, or to eat 'em. To which Argument the
Bi&s;hop returns this an&s;wer, That if the Church ex|horts
us to undertake the defence of Innocents, it
ought not in this ca&s;e to be by the way of Arms.
Fir&s;t, becau&s;e of two Evils we ought to chu&s;e the
lea&s;t. If the <HI>Indians</HI> ma&s;&s;acre &s;ome innocent Per&s;ons
to eat 'em, 'tis indeed a great Evil; but War would
bring much greater &s;laughters with it: be&s;ides, that
the&s;e Wars di&s;honour our Religion, and render the
Chri&s;tians odious to the Infidels; who tho they &s;a|crifice
men, are not altogether inexcu&s;able, becau&s;e
of their great Ignorance, and have rea&s;on not to
put them&s;elves into the hands of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldi|ers,
who come with their Swords in their hands to
rob and kill 'em, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing 'em in Reli|gion;
whereas they have no right to puni&s;h 'em for
their Errors: That <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, when the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="89">
&s;ubdued divers barbarous Nations, who were wont
to offer men in Sacrifice, they did not puni&s;h 'em for
that Crime, but only forbad 'em to do the like for
the future. That it is not to be expected of the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
that they &s;hould renounce their Errors in a mo|ment;
that the light of Nature which informs 'em
there is a God, teaches 'em to &s;hew him re&s;pect, and
to return him thanks for the Benefits they receive
of him, and likewi&s;e to endeavour to make atone|ment
for the Sins they commit again&s;t his Divine Ma|je&s;ty;
and that they ought to devote the be&s;t they
have to him in Sacrifice: Con&s;equently their evil
Cu&s;tom of &s;acrificing human Creatures to the &s;up|pos'd
Deities they wor&s;hip, is the le&s;s to be wonder'd
at, &s;ince they have no knowledg of Divine Revela|tion,
but only the glimmerings of natural Light to
direct 'em; which Light too is ob&s;cur'd with much
thick darkne&s;s in the minds of Pagans. That the&s;e
People believe they perform a very acceptable Ser|vice
to God, when they offer him the Lives of Men;
that this may be confirmed in &s;ome &s;ort by the Te|&s;timony
of Holy Writ, &s;eeing God, when he would
try the faithfulne&s;s of <HI>Abraham,</HI> commanded him to
&s;acrifice his only Son, whom he tenderly lov'd;
which God might do, as he is the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of
the Lives of Men: that be&s;ides this In&s;tance, the
Scripture te&s;tifies that God requir'd the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to
redeem their own Lives by the &s;acrifice of Animals.
That the Word of God remarks, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to give a greater Te&s;timony of Love, than to offer
ones &s;elf for the Per&s;on belov'd: that tho&s;e Women
in the <HI>Indies</HI> that were mo&s;t dear to their Husbands
while they lived, cho&s;e to be buried alive with 'em,
to give the greater proof of their conjugal Fidelity
and Affection.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the other Argument alledg'd by Dr.
<HI>Sepulueda,</HI> namely, that the barbarity of the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="89">
which (he &s;ays) &s;hews they were born for Slavery,
is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to declare War again&s;t 'em, in
order to &s;ubject 'em to the Government of the <HI>Eu|ropeans:</HI>
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> &s;ays, there are three
different &s;orts of <HI>Barbarians.</HI> Fir&s;t, that this Term
is taken in general to &s;ignify any Nation that differs
from others by &s;ome &s;trange Opinion, or peculiar
Cu&s;toms, tho they want not Prudence or Policy to
conduct their Affairs. That the &s;econd kind of
<HI>Barbarians</HI> is of tho&s;e, who have no Language pro|per
by which to expre&s;s them&s;elves to other People;
&s;uch as the Engli&s;h formerly were, when they had
no Letters or Characters whereby to explain their
Thoughts. The third &s;ort of <HI>Barbarians</HI> are &s;uch as
re&s;emble &s;avage Bea&s;ts, by the dulne&s;s and &s;tupidity
of their Minds, by their bruti&s;h Inclinations, and by
the extravagance of their Cu&s;toms; who wander up
and down in the Fields, never dwelling together in
Towns or Cities; who are without Laws or Civil
Government, and take no care to ob&s;erve the Law of
Nations; who rove about to commit Robberies,
and u&s;e Violence on all that have not power enough
to re&s;i&s;t 'em; &s;uch as the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Alans</HI> were for|merly,
and &s;uch as the <HI>Arabs</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are to this day:
That 'tis as lawful to make War with this &s;ort of
People, as to hunt wild Bea&s;ts, and would be a great
piece of &s;ervice to the World to reduce 'em to any
tolerable Di&s;ciplin. But as for the <HI>Indians,</HI> that
tho they have &s;ome extravagant Cu&s;toms, but
not any good Policy, yet they ought not to be
look'd upon as properly <HI>Barbarians;</HI> &s;eeing they are
of a quite contrary di&s;po&s;ition, being meek, civil,
and tractable in their Manners; that they are a nu|merous
People, who have Cities and Laws, and un|der&s;tand
divers Arts; that they have Princes over
'em, and live under a kind of regulated Government;
that they not only puni&s;h Sins again&s;t Nature, but
<PB N="160" REF="90">
have Laws that award capital Puni&s;hments for &s;ome
Crimes of le&s;&s;er con&s;equence: That their Policy has
its particular Rules; that upon all the&s;e Accounts
their pretended Barbarity is not a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on
for any to declare War again&s;t 'em, but would be a
piece of vi&s;ible Tyranny and Inju&s;tice; and that
this Cour&s;e would be &s;o far from promoting the
Go&s;pel, that 'twould be the very way to cut off all
hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing Chri&s;tianity among them. That
therefore the be&s;t expedient would be to &s;end
Preachers into the <HI>Indies,</HI> to endeavour to convince
&s;ome of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> of the truth of our
Religion; and to make Treaties of Peace with 'em,
to favour the entrance of the <HI>Europeans</HI> into the <HI>In|dies</HI>
by &s;uch a gentle and peaceable Method as this:
that if any danger &s;hould ari&s;e after this, we might
build &s;ome Forts upon the Frontiers, and &s;o treat
with 'em with the greater Security, and make 'em
gradually reli&s;h our Religion, by &s;etting 'em good
Examples.</P>
<P>The Royal Council for the <HI>Indies</HI> having heard this
Di&s;pute, between the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> and Dr. <HI>Se|pulueda,</HI>
concerning the manner in which the <HI>Indians</HI>
ought to be treated, order'd the Bi&s;hop to draw up
his Thoughts of this matter in Writing, whereby
they &s;hould be the better able to determin this que&s;ti|on,
Whether they might lawfully in&s;lave the <HI>Indians,</HI>
or were oblig'd to &s;et at liberty all they had hitherto
reduc'd to &s;lavery. In an&s;wer to their de&s;ire, the
Bi&s;hop farther explain'd his Sentiments after the fol|lowing
manner.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Indians</HI> taken in the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;ince the di&s;co|very
of the New World to this day, have bin un|ju&s;tly
in&s;lav'd; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who retain 'em in
bondage again&s;t their wills, can't do it with a good
<PB N="161" REF="90">
Con&s;cience, becau&s;e they had no right to declare
War again&s;t 'em; for it follows by con&s;equence they
could not lawfully deprive 'em of their Liberty, nor
were they ever authoriz'd by their Prince to make
War upon 'em. Now there are but two Motives
that can render any War ju&s;t, namely, &s;ome righte|ous
Cau&s;e, or the Authority of one's Prince. And
what ju&s;t motive then could the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have to de|clare
War again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> who never did 'em
any wrong, nor ever gave 'em any di&s;turbance? They
were people they had never &s;een; they had never
made any de&s;cent into any Country that belong'd to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to &s;poil and ravage it; they had ne|ver
profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tianity as the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> had
done, who were Chri&s;tian in the time of St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin;</HI>
or as the Kingdom of <HI>Grenada,</HI> the Empire
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> did
formerly. Nor can we ju&s;tly reproach the <HI>Indians</HI> as
declar'd enemies to our Religion, or that they ever
attempted to de&s;troy it by open Per&s;ecutions, or &s;e|cret
Per&s;wa&s;ions, by Pre&s;ents, or any other manner
what&s;oever, that can be u&s;ed to engage Chri&s;tians to
renounce their Faith, and turn Idolaters: For nei|ther
the Law of God, nor that of Nations ever
permitted War to be made again&s;t any People mere|ly
to e&s;tabli&s;h Chri&s;tianity among 'em. Unle&s;s any
one will pretend that the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which a|bounds
with Charity, Meekne&s;s, and Humanity, ought
to be introduc'd into the World by Force like the
Religion of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> can't &s;ay, that they had no other
end than that of protecting the Innocent, &s;eeing
they have made it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to rob, pil|lage,
and murder the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> taking upon 'em
to u&s;urp their Goods and Lands. Be&s;ides, if the
War they undertook had bin in defence of tho&s;e poor
Wretches the <HI>Indians</HI> unju&s;tly put to death for Sa|crifices,
<PB N="162" REF="91">
it would not have bin carried &s;o generally
thro' the <HI>Indies,</HI> but would have bin a &s;ort of Civil
War kept up only in &s;ome particular Places: Nor
would the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have had right even in &s;uch Pla|ces,
to have made Slaves of tho&s;e whom they took
in &s;uch a War.</P>
<P>They can't &s;o much as pretend that ever they had
a Command or Order to this day from their Prince,
to declare War again&s;t the <HI>Indians:</HI> 'Tis ea&s;y to e|vidence
&s;uch a Fact as this; for the Governors and
Generals have nothing to do but to &s;how their Com|mi&s;&s;ions
if they have any. There's not one of 'em
who has any fear of God, or re&s;pect for his Prince,
that will pretend to &s;hew any &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion, ex|cept
the Vice-Roy <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> and <HI>Don Seba&s;tian
Ramire</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cuenza;</HI> all the re&s;t that have made
War on the <HI>Indians,</HI> are Thieves, and Robbers, Mur|derers,
and declar'd Enemies of Mankind. Seeing
then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have had no lawful rea&s;on to &s;up|port
their Declarations of War again&s;t the People
of <HI>America,</HI> nor have bin authoriz'd in &s;uch Proceed|ings
by their Prince, it evidently follows that the
War they have made is inju&s;t, and contrary to the
Laws of God and Men, and con&s;equently that the
<HI>Indians</HI> ought not to have bin treated as Slaves.</P>
<P>All the ways the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have us'd to compa&s;s
this end of in&s;laving the&s;e People, have bin mon|&s;trou&s;ly
wicked, made up of nothing but Fraud and
Treachery, unlawful Tricks and Artifices, and &s;uch
unheard of Villanies as can't but fill the Minds of all
that hear 'em with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror. Some
to in&s;nare the poor <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd among 'em,
have con&s;train'd 'em to own them&s;elves their Slaves
in Courts of Ju&s;tice: after which extorted Confe&s;|&s;ion,
the Governors have order'd the King's Arms
to be fix'd upon their Skin with a hot Iron; tho they
were not ignorant what an unlawful Cour&s;e had been
<PB N="163" REF="91">
taken to abu&s;e the poor Creatures. Others hir'd the
<HI>Indians</HI> with a little Wine, or a Shirt, or by giving
'em &s;ome other trifle of &s;mall value, to bring 'em fa|therle&s;s
and motherle&s;s Children, whom they put on
Shipboard, and tran&s;ported into other Countries,
where they were &s;old for Slaves, e&s;pecially into <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
the I&s;lands of St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> or other
neighbouring I&s;lands. But at fir&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
us'd open Violence, attacking the <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd
peaceably in their Hou&s;es, &s;etting their Towns on
fire, ma&s;&s;acring &s;ome, and after the exerci&s;e of all
this Cruelty, carrying away tho&s;e they could take
alive to &s;ell 'em for Slaves. They us'd without any
formal proce&s;s, to brand 'em with the King's Arms;
which was enough to make 'em pa&s;s for Slaves; and
accordingly they were &s;old from one hand to ano|ther,
till they were tran&s;ported into the I&s;lands.
The&s;e were all the forms of Ju&s;tice the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ob|&s;erv'd
in carrying away the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Conti|nent
into the I&s;lands of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> the I&s;les of <HI>Cuba</HI>
and St. <HI>John,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pearls, Yucatan</HI> and <HI>Panu|co.</HI>
And by the&s;e execrable Artifices they have &s;ince
carried away va&s;t multitudes of People of every
Age, Sex, and Condition, from the Kingdoms of <HI>Ven|cu&eacute;la,
Guatimala,</HI> and <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> to fell 'em in <HI>Pa|nama,</HI>
and in <HI>Peru.</HI> They once put 4 or 500 of 'em
in one Ship, the greate&s;t part of whom died in their
pa&s;&s;age for want of Food, the Allowance given 'em
being &s;o very &s;mall.</P>
<P>At a Town con&s;i&s;ting of about 200 people, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would require the <HI>Cacyque</HI> to &s;end 'em
300 <HI>Indians</HI> at &s;uch a certain day and hour, to carry
their Provi&s;ions, and work for 'em. The poor
<HI>Cacyque</HI> was mightily concern'd he could not ex|ecute
this Order, not having People enough in the
whole Town; and not knowing what to do in the
ca&s;e, de&s;ired to have a day or two more allow'd him:
<PB N="164" REF="92">
But the&s;e Brutes would interpret this delay as an ex|pre&s;s
breach of their Orders; and immediately ask|ing
leave of the Governor to go and fall upon 'em,
would attaque 'em in their hou&s;es, cutting the
throats of many of 'em in a barbarous manner, and
carrying away the re&s;t as Pri&s;oners of War, whom
they in&s;lav'd contrary to all Law and Equity. Some|times
they would order a <HI>Cacyque</HI> to &s;end 'em half
a hundred men to labour for 'em, and would &s;et
'em to what work they thought good, after which
they would embark 'em in Ships and carry 'em away;
and &s;ometimes would mark 'em with the Letters of
their own Names without fixing the King's Arms
on 'em. When they were angry with 'em, they
would load 'em with Chains, and make 'em carry
heavy Burdens be&s;ide, for 100 or 200 Leagues. Af|ter
they had us'd 'em in what Drudgery they pleas'd,
they would &s;ell 'em, tho the <HI>Indians</HI> are as freeborn
as any other Nation. By this means the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have unpeopled the Province of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which
is &s;ituate between <HI>Guatimala</HI> and <HI>Nicaraqua.</HI></P>
<P>When they formerly advanc'd far into the Coun|try
to make further Di&s;coveries of the <HI>Indians</HI> that
liv'd there, the&s;e good-natur'd People came to meet
'em loaded with Turkeys, and other Provi&s;ions,
which they freely offer'd 'em, but for their kindne&s;&s;
were either hew'd in pieces, or le&s;e made Slaves,
on pretence they were found in Arms in the Fields.
Nor could the Governors be ignorant of the&s;e
Violences and Di&s;orders or the Soldiers, &s;ince them|&s;elves
had the be&s;t &s;hare of the Spoil.</P>
<P>When they had divided tho&s;e Countries among
them&s;elves, which they had &s;o unju&s;tly u&s;urp'd, and
render'd them&s;elves the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
as if they had coquer'd 'em in a ju&s;t and
lawful War, they oblig'd the <HI>Caciques</HI> and natural
Princes of tho&s;e People to bring 'em &s;uch a Sum of
<PB N="165" REF="92">
Gold as they were pleas'd to command 'em. If they
had not &s;uch a quantity, they told the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
they would willingly give 'em all they had to ap|pea&s;e
'em; but receiv'd a &s;evere reply from the&s;e
cruel Men in &s;uch terms as the&s;e: <HI>If you don't bring
us all the Gold we demand within &s;uch a time, we'll &s;et fire
to all your hou&s;es.</HI> The poor <HI>Cacyques</HI> would &s;ome|times
make &s;uch a return as this in a lamentable
Tone: <HI>Indeed our Country has no great &s;tore of Gold in
it; and be&s;ides, we have not bin curious to &s;earch for
Mines.</HI> Upon &s;uch an Account as this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have fa&s;ten'd 200 Stakes at a time in the ground,
and tied the poor Wretches to 'em with terrible
Menaces, and then let loo&s;e tho&s;e ravenous Dogs up|on
'em, that us'd to be fed with human fle&s;h. It
may be the <HI>Cacique</HI> would be &s;o terrified with &s;uch
a horrible Spectacle as this, that he'd go among his
Subjects, and take Children out of every Family,
and give 'em to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Slaves to pacify
'em. If there were but 2 Children in a hou&s;e, one of
'em was taken away, and that mu&s;t be the &s;tronge&s;t
and likelie&s;t to do &s;ervice. When the <HI>Cacique</HI> had
got together &s;uch a number of his People as the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
requir'd, he would come to pre&s;ent 'em to them
him&s;elf. And it was a mo&s;t lamentable thing to
hear the Sighs and Crys of Parents, when their dear|e&s;t
Children were ravi&s;h'd from 'em, to be tran&s;port|ed
into remote Countrys for Slaves. When the&s;e
Children were brought to the Governor to be brand|ed,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would order the <HI>Caciques</HI> to engage
the <HI>Indians</HI> to te&s;tify that they were Slaves, and
the Children of Slaves, and that they were bought
in the Market; and would threaten to burn 'em,
unle&s;s they would &s;tand to &s;uch Lies as the&s;e. And
when the Per&s;on appointed to examin them, who
was well acquainted with all the&s;e Tricks, would
ask the Children of what Country they were; they
<PB N="166" REF="93">
made 'em an&s;wer, that they were Slaves, and that
their Parents were &s;o, and that they were bought in
&s;uch a Market. After this Examination they were
mark'd with the King's Stamp. His Maje&s;ty's Go|vernors
and Officers are very well acquainted with
all this Roguery of the Soldiers, and have had
too great a hand in the invention of the&s;e Artifices,
as appears by their having the large&s;t &s;hare of the
Booty.</P>
<P>When the Mi&s;&s;ionary Monks had got a great num|ber
of <HI>Indians</HI> together in their Church to in&s;truct
'em in the knowledg of the true God, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
would &s;uddenly come upon 'em with their
Swords in their hands, and take what number of
'em they thought meet; which could not but much
&s;candalize the re&s;t, and extremely griev'd the Mi&s;|&s;ionaries,
who were only told by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that
they wanted Men to carry their Baggage and Provi|&s;ions,
and &s;o were forc'd to take all patiently. When
they had thus &s;eiz'd the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> they &s;et their
mark upon 'em, and &s;old 'em for Slaves.</P>
<P>The Governors at fir&s;t &s;eldom refus'd any that
ask'd leave to plunder the <HI>Indians,</HI> and ruin and de|polulate
the Country. This was a kind of recom|pen&s;e
they gave 'em for the great Services they had
render'd the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> But afterwards they
took a Cour&s;e that did not &s;eem &s;o di&s;hone&s;t and
cruel, but was equally pernicious to the People of
the New World, which was to buy Slaves of the
<HI>Caciques,</HI> threatning 'em to burn 'em alive if they
did not furni&s;h 'em with &s;uch a number as they de|manded,
for which they would only give 'em a
Shirt or &s;ome &s;uch Trifle; &s;o that the poor <HI>Caciques</HI>
became them&s;elves the ruin of their own Country
for fear of being burnt, and made it their bu&s;ine&s;s
to go among their Subjects to gather great numbers
of Slaves together, to &s;asisfy the Avarice of the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="93">
At la&s;t they would make the <HI>Caciques</HI> pay
'em this tribute with other People; &s;o that they
were con&s;train'd to go to &s;ome of the neighbouring
<HI>Caciques,</HI> and would make their Complaint to 'em
after this manner: <HI>The&s;e Tyrant threaten me</HI> (would
one &s;ay) <HI>to cut my throat if I don't furni&s;h 'em with
&s;uch a number of</HI> Indians <HI>for Slaves, and they won't
&s;uffer me to chu&s;e out &s;ome of my own Subjects for 'em;
therefore I de&s;ire the liberty to take &s;ome of yours, and
you &s;hall have as many of mine for 'em. I am content</HI>
(would the other &s;ay) <HI>and the rather becau&s;e I my
&s;elf am oblig'd to pay &s;uch a Tribute as you are, and to
&s;eek for Slaves out of my own Country to &s;atisfy the</HI> Spa|niards.
The <HI>Caciques</HI> them&s;elves were wont to bring
the&s;e poor Slaves to be mark'd, and were made to
&s;wear they were none of their Subjects, but that they
had taken 'em among their Neighbors; which was
true, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were never the le&s;s guilty in
con&s;training 'em &s;o to do. The Governors that knew
their inju&s;tice and roguery, wink'd at it, and would
never accu&s;e any of 'em of the&s;e prevarications be|fore
the Judges of the Royal Council; for they
made it no part of their care to perform their Duty
to God and the King faithfully; nor did they &s;eem
to be touch'd with the lea&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion in ob&s;erv|ing
all the violence committed again&s;t tho&s;e mi&s;era|ble
People.</P>
<P>I could produce a multitude of proofs to con|firm
what I &s;ay, but one &s;hall &s;uffice at pre&s;ent.
There came an Order from the King to the Gover|nor
of the Province of <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> to forbid him to
in&s;lave any <HI>Indians,</HI> or to brand him with the King's
Arms: at the &s;ame time there was a Ship in the
Road that was de&s;ign'd to be fill'd with Slaves;
which made the Governor forbear to publi&s;h the
Order he had receiv'd, till the Ve&s;&s;el was laden
with <HI>Indians,</HI> and ready to &s;et &s;ail; nay he privately
<PB N="168" REF="94">
gave notice to tho&s;e that were concern'd in the Ship,
to make what ha&s;te they could, and carry away as
many Slaves as they needed, becau&s;e the King had
&s;ent an expre&s;s Prohibition to hinder any from being
in&s;laved for the future.</P>
<P>It was once matter of A&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee the
fruitfulne&s;s, plenty and multitude of Inhabitants, that
fill'd the Province of <HI>Honduras;</HI> and 'tis now as de|plorable
to behold the Mi&s;ery, De&s;olation, and
want to People there, which re&s;emble it to a melan|choly
Wilderne&s;s. The Governor of this Province
made u&s;e of a trick not much unlike that of which
we have been &s;peaking. He ow'd a great Sum of
Mony to &s;ome Merchants for Wine and other Com|modities
he had bought of 'em; who had their
Ve&s;&s;els in the Port, and expected this Governor to
pay 'em in Slaves. But the Emperor's Order forbid|ding
him to make any Slaves in this Province being
very &s;trict, he dur&s;t not take up <HI>Indians</HI> publicly to pay
his debts, for fear of provoking the Emperor by acting
directly again&s;t his Command: He therefore &s;ent out
two of his Captains, one to the Sea-Coa&s;t, and the
other farther up into the Continent, with Orders to
take up &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> as were likely to make the lea&s;t
noi&s;e and di&s;turbance by their Complaints; the&s;e he
order'd to be embarqued, and to prevent to him&s;elf
any danger from the Court, he pretended the&s;e <HI>In|dians</HI>
were &s;editious Per&s;ons and Malefactors, whom
he was oblig'd to bani&s;h, becau&s;e it would have been
of ill con&s;equence to have let 'em remain in their
Country: This was the Pretext under which he &s;old
'em for Slaves to pay his Debts. And with this &s;ort
of Coin the <HI>Spaniards</HI> us'd to buy all &s;orts of Com|modities
that came from <HI>Europe,</HI> and whatever el&s;e
they thought nece&s;&s;ary. So that 'tis no wonder
that tho&s;e fine and rich Provinces are become for|lorn
De&s;erts, &s;ince this Trade of buying and &s;elling
<PB N="169" REF="94">
Slaves has been allow'd, which was fir&s;t practis'd in
<HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to deceive the
<HI>Indians</HI> would per&s;wade 'em they &s;hould go with
them into <HI>Spain,</HI> when they de&s;ign'd only to carry
'em to the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and &s;ell 'em there. And
there are many &s;till at <HI>Havana,</HI> that were taken af|ter
this manner; for when other <HI>Spaniards</HI> heard of
the Stratagems their Countrymen us'd to impo&s;e on
the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> they would u&s;e the &s;ame Tricks,
and brag of 'em in&s;tead of being a&s;ham'd; &s;o that
the World has been &s;ufficiently inform'd of the&s;e Ar|tifices.
The Mi&s;eries and De&s;olations of the Provin|ces
of <HI>Nicaraqua</HI> and <HI>Guatimala,</HI> of the greate&s;t part of
<HI>Mexico, Tabe&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Panuco,</HI> are inconte&s;tible Proofs
of the Cruelties and other Crimes of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI>
The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mexico</HI> wrote an Account of 'em
by way of complaint to the Royal Council for the
<HI>Indies,</HI> wherein he inform'd 'em that the Governor
had loaded twenty eight Ships with Slaves. The
Governor of the Province of <HI>Xali&s;co</HI> took for his
own Share 4560 Slaves, Men, Women and Chil|dren,
&s;ome of whom were but one, others two or
three years old; all was fi&s;h that came to net; be|&s;ides
an infinit number that other <HI>Spaniards</HI> took in
this Province, again&s;t the King's expre&s;s Orders,
who was much di&s;pleas'd that tho&s;e People &s;hould
be in&s;lav'd, who ought to have bin in&s;tructed in the
knowledge of the true God, and of the Chri&s;tian
Religion, in order to their Salvation. Tho&s;e Fle|mi&s;h
Merchants that got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom
of <HI>Ven&ccedil;uela,</HI> to pillage and de&s;troy it, made horri|ble
Spoil there for the &s;pace of twenty years. That
all I &s;ay is the very Truth, may better appear
by con&s;ulting the Archives of the Royal Council,
which are full of complaints again&s;t the in&s;idious
Contrivances of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the great Violen|ces
they have committed to en&s;lave the poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="95">
The&s;e poor Wretches have no body to interceed
for 'em, or to protect 'em; and are always in great
con&s;ternation, becau&s;e continually expos'd to the in|&s;ults
of their Enemies, who oppre&s;s 'em without be|ing
call'd to account for it. So that they de&s;pair of
relief, not knowing to whom to addre&s;s them&s;elves
for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing the Artifices that have bin us'd to in|&s;lave
the&s;e poor Creatures, are &s;o unju&s;t and tyranni|cal;
and &s;eeing the&s;e People as well as others are
born free, it follows that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have acted
contrary to the Law of Nations, in in&s;laving all tho&s;e
<HI>Indians</HI> whom they have taken for that end ever
&s;ince the Di&s;covery of the New World, and have
by their Violences evidently tran&s;gre&s;s'd the Law of
God and Nature.</P>
<P>To prove yet farther that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are ob|lig'd
to re&s;tore tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> their Liberty, whom
they yet detain in bondage, there's only need of
making one reflection, namely, that the Law of God
obliges us to make re&s;titution of every thing we
have taken unju&s;tly from our Neighbours, and to
make reparation for the injuries done 'em; and
without doing thus 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;av'd. Up|on
this Principle 'tis evident, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
ought to relea&s;e their <HI>Indians</HI> Slaves, and to do what
in 'em lies to make 'em amends for the wrong they
have done 'em, again&s;t all Law and Equity; for 'tis
not to be &s;uppos'd the &s;in will be forgiven, till
what has bin unju&s;tly taken away is re&s;tor'd; and
con&s;equently the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have treated the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> after &s;o ill a manner, and yet don't go
about to make 'em &s;atisfaction, are under the guilt
of a mortal Sin.</P>
<P>To make this appear yet more evidently, two
things mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd. Fir&s;t, that there were no
Slaves in <HI>New Spain,</HI> on the Borders of which there
<PB N="171" REF="95">
dwelt divers Nations, e&s;pecially the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> that
are more dexterous and politic than other <HI>Indians:</HI>
This every one knows who is acquainted with
the new World. Secondly, That the term <HI>Slave</HI>
does not &s;ignify the &s;ame thing among the <HI>Indians</HI> as
among the <HI>Europeans,</HI> but only denotes a Servant
with the former, or one that has &s;ome particular
obligation to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our nece&s;&s;ary Affairs; &s;o
that to be the Slave of an <HI>Indian,</HI> is to be but one
degree below his Son; 'tis to dwell in his Hou&s;e, to
take care of his Goods and Silver, to wait on his
Wife and Children, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the
enjoyment of his Liberty: He &s;ets the Hou&s;e in
order, &s;ows the Land, and does any nece&s;&s;ary work,
as occa&s;ion requires. And his Ma&s;ter on his part
treats him with a great deal of Kindne&s;s and Hu|manity,
as if he were not oblig'd to render him this
Service. Tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries that have learn'd the
<HI>Indian</HI> Language, and know the import of their
words, can te&s;tify the truth of what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>It is farther to be &s;uppos'd, that in <HI>New Spain</HI> and
<HI>Mexico</HI> many unlawful ways have bin us'd by the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to in&s;lave the <HI>Indians,</HI> in &s;o much that one
would have thought they knew nothing of the true
God, nor had ever heard of the Precepts of the
Go&s;pel. When there was a Famin there, which &s;el|dom
happens in tho&s;e rich and fertil Countries,
tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that had a &s;tock of Corn, per&s;waded
them that were poor to &s;ell 'em their Children for
&s;ome of their Corn: with this propo&s;al they com|ply'd
very willingly, becau&s;e their Servitude is &s;o
ea&s;y, their Slaves not being oblig'd to any very hard
Labor. And the <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally ob&s;equious and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e on whom they depend; they
would give one of their Children for five Bu&s;hels of
Corn, and this was the ordinary Price they gave.
'Tis true, this was an unju&s;t method of making
<PB N="172" REF="96">
Slaves, becau&s;e all things ought to be common in a
time of extreme Nece&s;&s;ity; for the Law of Na|ture
obliges us freely to give or lend to tho&s;e that
are under pre&s;&s;ing want.</P>
<P>Another occa&s;ion on which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made
the <HI>Indians</HI> their Slaves was this; when any one had
found an <HI>Indian</HI> with &s;ome Ears of Corn which he
had &s;tolen, he had Authority to make him his Slave.
The Mi&s;&s;ionaries have ob&s;erv'd that &s;ome of 'em
would maliciou&s;ly &s;catter Ears of Corn in the High|ways,
that they might &s;eize tho&s;e for Slaves that
had innocently gather'd 'em up. Be&s;ides this, the
Parents and Relations of him that had the Corn
found upon him were made Slaves for this imagina|ry
Theft, which is a very unju&s;t and criminal Ar|tifice.
They likewi&s;e had invented a &s;ort of Play
among 'em, in which he that lo&s;t was made a Slave;
the be&s;t Players would make as if they knew not
how to play, to in&s;nare tho&s;e that were ignorant
into their Service. If any one whom they had thus
caught, pre&s;um'd to run away, his neare&s;t Relations
were forc'd to &s;upply his place. When a Free-man
had lain with a Woman that was a Slave, her Ma&s;ter
had power to &s;eize him, or his Wife, if he were
married, and to oblige him to &s;erve him till &s;he was
brought to bed. Which Cu&s;tom obtain'd through|out
the whole Country. He that had a young Maid to
his Slave, would in&s;lave any one that lay with her,
which was attended with great Inconveniences;
for the Ma&s;ters of the&s;e young She-&s;laves would put
'em upon enticing Men to lie with 'em, on purpo&s;e
to catch 'em in this Trap. If a Slave took any thing
out of his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e to give it to his Relations,
they all immediately became his Ma&s;ter's Slaves.
When &s;everal Merchants went into other Countries
for Slaves to &s;ell in <HI>New Spain,</HI> where they had the
be&s;t trade for 'em, they lent tho&s;e that were poor
<PB N="173" REF="96">
their Goods and Corn upon U&s;ury; and when they
were not in a condition to pay for what they had
bought, they &s;eiz'd 'em for Slaves. If he that ow'd
the Sum, died before the Debt was di&s;charg'd, and
his Wife and Children were not capable of paying
the Creditor, they became his Slaves. In time of Fa|min,
Parents would &s;ell one of their Children to &s;erve
a Ma&s;ter for a certain number of years; but indeed
there was no end of this Servitude, for if the Ma&s;ter
dy'd, his Relations would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Slave.
But the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who is a very pious and
virtuous Prelat, has written an account in Latin of
all the Tricks the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have us'd to in&s;lave the
<HI>Indians;</HI> by which 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee with how much
Inju&s;tice they have abus'd the Simplicity and Nece&s;|&s;ity
of the&s;e poor wretches to reduce 'em to a mi&s;e|rable
&s;tate of Bondage.</P>
<P>From what I have been relating it appears, that
the <HI>Indians</HI> being Idolaters, and de&s;titute of the
knowledg of the true God, and the Rules of Chri&s;|tianity,
don't regulate their Actions by &s;uch Mo|tives
as the fear of Hell, and the de&s;ire of Heaven,
and the hope of having their good Works rewarded
hereafter: Therefore they are vicious and corrupt
in many re&s;pects; for in&s;tance, they don't ob&s;erve
the Law of Nations in the Wars they make one up|on
another; by which one may well gue&s;s there are
many other inju&s;t things done among 'em.</P>
<P>But the Faith of Chri&s;t, and the Precepts of the
Go&s;pel are for pre&s;erving only good Laws and
Cu&s;toms, and for aboli&s;hing tho&s;e that are bad, e&s;pe|cially
&s;uch as are oppo&s;ite to the Law of Nature,
and prejudicial to Human Society. Therefore tho&s;e
<HI>Indians</HI> that are converted, who have bin guilty of
Polygamy, are oblig'd to put away all their Wives
but one, according to the pre&s;cription of the Law
of God, as well as to re&s;tore all the Goods they
<PB N="174" REF="97">
have gotten by unlawful ways of Robbery or Extor|tion.
If Chri&s;tians follow the evil Cu&s;toms of In|fidels,
or tolerate 'em when they can hinder 'em,
they manife&s;tly render them&s;elves Accomplices in
the Crimes of tho&s;e Idolaters, becau&s;e we are ob|lig'd
by the Divine Law to ab&s;tain from &s;uch Actions
as may occa&s;ion Scandal, or any way injure the
temporal or &s;piritual Welfare of our Neighbor.
For this rea&s;on St. <HI>Paul</HI> commanded Chri&s;tians not
to eat things offer'd to Idols, le&s;t it &s;hould be
thought they approv'd of tho&s;e damnable Sacri|fices;
tho they might eat of tho&s;e very meats, pro|vided
the Pagans did not &s;ee 'em, and &s;o were not
&s;candaliz'd by the Action.</P>
<P>All Chri&s;tians are oblig'd by the Divine Word
to do what in 'em lies for the Abolition of &s;inful
Cu&s;toms, or at lea&s;t to ab&s;tain from 'em, and di&s;|approve
'em them&s;elves. And when a man doubts
whether any Action he is about to do is ju&s;t or inju&s;t,
he can't do it with a good Con&s;cience: this is a ge|neral
Rule that admits of no exception, becau&s;e
Chri&s;tians are oblig'd by the Doctrin of the Go&s;pel,
rather to lo&s;e all they have than to commit the lea&s;t
Sin. Therefore while the Mind he&s;itates and doubts,
whether the Action on which one thinks be &s;in or
no, we ought nece&s;&s;arily to ab&s;tain from it. The
very de&s;ire of doing &s;uch an Action is contrary to
right Rea&s;on, and to the Love of God; becau&s;e it
would be to expo&s;e one's &s;elf to the hazard of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
the Divine Will, to do that concerning
which one labors under an uncertainty whether it
be lawful or forbidden. And the Doubt, when one
thus ventures to &s;in, is no longer a mere Doubt,
but mo&s;t certainly becomes an Offence again&s;t God,
becau&s;e we are always oblig'd to take the &s;afe&s;t
cour&s;e. When it falls out that we meet with two
ways, and are uncertain which is the right, we
<PB N="175" REF="97">
ought always to chu&s;e that which is the lea&s;t dan|gerous,
according to that Maxim of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI>
in his penitential Book, <HI>Take what is certain, and
leave what is uncertain.</HI></P>
<P>The Rules of the Civil Law, which are confirm'd
by Rea&s;on, by the Law of Nature, and that of
Chri&s;tian Charity, admit of a Di&s;pen&s;ation in &s;ome
ca&s;es, when there is a pro&s;pect of &s;ome great Good,
to which a greater &s;trictne&s;s would probably be
prejudicial. But 'tis a general Rule, that when a
Man deliberates on two doubtful things, he is to
determin his choice on that &s;ide where he may avoid
Sin, where there are the fewe&s;t Inconveniences,
and where his Neighbour's Intere&s;t runs the lea&s;t
hazard. Upon this Principle, Clergy-men ought
not to be oblig'd to retire and live &s;eparatly from
their Mothers, Grandmothers or Si&s;ters, or to for|&s;ake
their Father's Hou&s;e; becau&s;e &s;uch a Separation
may be very di&s;advantagious to 'em, tho there may
po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome Inconvenience likewi&s;e in their
dwelling together.</P>
<P>That man retains a thing with an evil Con&s;cience,
about which he is in doubt whether it be lawfully
gotten, or which he has receiv'd of one who had
no right to it, or who had rea&s;on to doubt whether
it belong'd to him or no. Whatever is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is kept contrary to the
Rules of Ju&s;tice, and again&s;t both the Law of God
and Nature. Therefore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who keep
tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> in &s;lavery, concerning whom they are
in doubt whether they have bin bought, or given
to tho&s;e of whom they had 'em, act contrary to
Ju&s;tice and to the Law of God, in retaining 'em
while under this doubt. Every one knows that a
man is oblig'd to re&s;tore whatever he does not law|fully
po&s;&s;e&s;s, and whatever he has receiv'd from one
that had no ju&s;t right to it, becau&s;e a man can't
<PB N="176" REF="98">
communicate a right to another which he has not
fir&s;t him&s;elf. Thus when any one buys or receives
any thing from a Per&s;on who &s;ells or gives it, and
yet has no right to it, he is unju&s;t if he keeps it,
and is oblig'd to make re&s;titution. The Rea&s;on is
evident, becau&s;e 'tis no le&s;s than the commi&s;&s;ion of
Theft, wilfully to retain any thing again&s;t the will
of him to whom it appertains. And tho this thing
&s;hould have pa&s;t through a thou&s;and hands before it
came to you, you would have no right to withold
it from the proper Owner, becau&s;e the&s;e were all
unlawful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and con&s;equently ought to have
made re&s;titution. And tho &s;ome human Laws give
permi&s;&s;ion to retain a thing which one has bought
with Mony that is coin'd with the King's &s;tamp, and
is current in the Commonwealth, yet this is no law|ful
Title to it, becau&s;e human Laws mu&s;t not pre|&s;cribe
contrary to the Law of God and Nature, nor
to good Morals, which forbid Theft, and the with|olding
of another man's Goods again&s;t the con&s;ent of
the rightful Owner. Inferiors, and &s;uch are Kings
them&s;elves in re&s;pect of the Divine Maje&s;ty, can't
ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;h any thing in prejudice to the Law of
God, which is &s;uperior to all other Laws.</P>
<P>He that buys &s;tolen Goods knowingly, is an Ac|ce&s;&s;ory
in the Robbery: and if he does but &s;u&s;pect
they are &s;tolen, and has not bin &s;o diligent as he
might have bin, to inform him&s;elf whether they
were lawfully gotten, he can't keep 'em with a good
Con&s;cience; becau&s;e no man can innocently do that
which expo&s;es him to Sin. And if we will not take
the pains to inform our &s;elves whether that which
is &s;old or given to us be lawfully gotten, when we
are in doubt about it, we can't be the lawful Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors,
becau&s;e this is a culpable and wilful Igno|rance.
Tho&s;e who have in &s;uch ca&s;es con&s;ulted Men
capable of giving information, are excu&s;able, un|le&s;s
<PB N="177" REF="98">
them&s;elves be of &s;uch a Character as obliges
'em to be acquainted with Law and Equity, as Ci|vilians,
Judges, and the like; or when they ask ad|vice,
content them&s;elves with con&s;ulting only one
Per&s;on, tho they have opportunity of advi&s;ing with
many; or ask coun&s;el of intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, and &s;uch
as will not an&s;wer according to the Dictates of their
Con&s;cience, in&s;tead of con&s;ulting Men of Integrity
who will give advice according to the Rules of Law
and Equity; or when they addre&s;s them&s;elves to
Per&s;ons who&s;e Hone&s;ty is &s;u&s;pected upon good
grounds. A Man is not excu&s;able under &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances
as the&s;e, tho he ask Coun&s;el of the
Learned in the Law; and after having taken their
Advice, acts contrary to Right and Equity. The&s;e
four Circum&s;tances being regarded, may be of great
u&s;e to ea&s;e &s;crupulous per&s;ons of their doubts, and
to give 'em peace of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And by the&s;e Principles it may be ea&s;ily known
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> unju&s;tly retain mo&s;t of their <HI>In|dian</HI>
Slaves again&s;t the Law of God: and if they
have a right to any of 'em, the number is very &s;mall,
and they have rea&s;on to doubt whether the&s;e have
been lawfully made Slaves; becau&s;e tho&s;e they have
had from the <HI>Indians</HI> have been brought to 'em as
a Tribute extorted from 'em again&s;t their will, by
Fear, Menaces and Torments; &s;o that they have no
ju&s;t Title to 'em: or if they have bought 'em of
<HI>Indians,</HI> they have us'd unfair tricks to procure 'em,
having terrified the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and con&s;train'd 'em
by Tortures to deliver up their Subjects into their
hands, threatning otherwi&s;e to acu&s;e 'em to the
Judges for wor&s;hipping and offering Sacrifices to
Idols; &s;o that the poor <HI>Caciques</HI> when they could
not give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they de|manded,
us'd to &s;teal 'em where they could&punc; 'Tis
true, when the&s;e Di&s;orders came to be known to his
<PB N="178" REF="99">
Maje&s;ty, he expre&s;ly forbad any &s;uch ways of in|&s;laving
the People for the future.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e few Slaves which the <HI>Indians</HI> have
voluntarily &s;old, tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have hitherto
made no que&s;tion that they had a lawful right to
'em, they have had however rea&s;on enough to doubt
it, and they ought by no means to have taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 'em, till they had fir&s;t us'd all nece&s;&s;a|ry
diligence to get information whether they might
do it with a good Con&s;cience; and if after all their
inquiry the matter remain'd dubious, they ought
not to have bought 'em while under that &s;cruple:
So that all the ways they have taken to procure
them&s;elves great numbers of Slaves are unlawful:
And when the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes &s;aw how eagerly the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> pur&s;u'd this trade, they would tyrannize
over their Subjects, and force 'em to become Slaves,
that they might be capable of an&s;wering the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
demands, and of buying the trifles they &s;old 'em.
The Judges of the Royal Council, who have &s;ounded
this matter to the bottom, have declar'd, that &s;carce
any of the <HI>Indians</HI> have been lawfully in&s;lav'd, and
on this account have &s;et many of 'em at liberty.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;&s;ionary Monks who under&s;tood the Lan|guage
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were acquainted with
their Secrets, have declar'd, that tho&s;e who have
kept 'em as their Slaves, have done &s;o without any
ju&s;t ground: and they had no intere&s;t to &s;peak after
this manner, being only concern'd about the Salva|tion
of Souls.</P>
<P>And can it be thought that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were ig|norant
of what them&s;elves had done, who made
them&s;elves formidable to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and forc'd
'em by &s;evere Puni&s;hment to procure 'em what
Slaves they requir'd? And the&s;e ignorant Infidels,
who have &s;o little of the fear or love of God, might
ea&s;ily per&s;wade them&s;elves that there was no In|ju&s;tice
<PB N="179" REF="99">
in doing what they &s;aw Chri&s;tians do before
'em; &s;o that their ill Examples might well embolden
'em to &s;teal away fatherle&s;s Children, to trepan the
ignorant, and even to make u&s;e of force and vio|lence
to get Slaves to &s;ell to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> For
after this manner have the <HI>Indians</HI> been corrupted
and induc'd to commit all kinds of Inju&s;tice again&s;t
their own Country-men to procure Slaves, &s;ince
they have had Conver&s;ation with the Chri&s;tians,
who incouraged 'em in the&s;e Tricks, not only by
their Words, but likewi&s;e by their Example. And
'tis mo&s;t certain, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not be igno|rant
of the&s;e unrighteous Proceedings, &s;ince them|&s;elves
were the occa&s;ion and in&s;truments of all this
Mi&s;chief: and it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be granted, that they
were oblig'd to &s;u&s;pect whether the Slaves that were
brought 'em were taken as lawful Pri&s;oners of War,
and to inquire whether they might keep 'em with a
good Con&s;cience or not.</P>
<P>They drove this trade with &s;u&s;picious Per&s;ons,
and therefore might well have pre&s;um'd that they
offended the Rules of Ju&s;tice; and that tho&s;e that
gave or &s;old the&s;e Slaves to 'em, had no right &s;o to
do. Men ought to be very cautious how they deal
with the <HI>Indians,</HI> le&s;t they approve of the Theft and
other Crimes of the&s;e Infidels. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew
well enough what was commonly reported of the
<HI>Indians</HI> every where, that they us'd many unju&s;t and
tyrannical ways to get Slaves on all &s;ides; and there|fore
ought to have &s;crupled the buying of 'em &s;uch
as were naturally free, and who had bin in&s;lav'd
again&s;t the Law of Nations: So that they can ne|ver
excu&s;e them&s;elves from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing 'em unju&s;tly,
and from participating of the Crimes of the <HI>Indians</HI>
in &s;tealing and captivating great numbers of People.
Among a hundred thou&s;and Slaves whom the <HI>Indians</HI>
have &s;old to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or paid 'em by way of
<PB N="180" REF="100">
Tribute, perhaps not one of 'em was properly a
Slave, or taken in a ju&s;t and lawful War. But al|lowing
&s;ome of 'em to be &s;o, how could they be di&s;|tingui&s;h'd
from the re&s;t in this va&s;t number? Be&s;ides,
that there is a great difference, as we have already
ob&s;erv'd, between the Slaves of the <HI>Indians</HI> and
tho&s;e of the <HI>Europeans:</HI> The former make Slavery
not very unea&s;y or trouble&s;om, their Slaves being
in a manner free, and not much differing from their
Children; whereas Slavery among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is a
mo&s;t terrible condition, and tho&s;e that are &s;ubjected
to it, enjoy no Favor, Comfort or Re&s;t, but are con|tinually
expos'd to Hunger and Thir&s;t, and other
&s;evere Puni&s;hments: Nor are there any Laws or
Statutes that can &s;often the cruel Temper of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and hinder 'em from exacting of their
Slaves &s;uch Service as &s;urpa&s;&s;es human Strength.</P>
<P>From all the Principles we have been e&s;tabli&s;hing,
it follows, Fir&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty is oblig'd by the
Law of God to &s;et all tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> at liberty,
whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made their Slaves, and
unju&s;tly retain as &s;uch. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty
is oblig'd to do Ju&s;tice to all the World, to great
and &s;mall, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, without de|&s;pi&s;ing
the Cau&s;e of the mi&s;erable and afflicted, who
are not in a condition to defend them&s;elves, or re|dre&s;s
their own Grievances. 'Tis the principal du|ty
of Kings to execute Ju&s;tice, and protect the
weak again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong; and
when they fail in this, they &s;ometimes draw down
the Divine Vengeance on their own Per&s;ons and
Kingdoms; becau&s;e the Cries of the poor, and &s;uch
as labor under Mi&s;ery, ince&s;&s;antly go up to the
Throne of God. And &s;ince the <HI>Spaniards</HI> unju&s;tly
oppre&s;s the <HI>Indians,</HI> who have no way to &s;ecure
them&s;elves from the Violence and Tyranny of their
Per&s;ecutors; 'tis evident his Maje&s;ty is oblig'd to
<PB N="181" REF="100">
&s;top the cour&s;e of their Inju&s;tice, and to re&s;tore
tho&s;e poor People their Liberty who groan under
&s;o cruel a Bondage. Nor ought this to be one mo|ment
deferr'd, &s;eeing the&s;e Vexations are publick
and notorious, and his Maje&s;ty cannot be ignorant
of 'em.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Kings that are willing to ob&s;erve the &s;trict
Rules of Ju&s;tice, whether Pagans or Chri&s;tians, ought
to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Efforts to keep their Subjects in
peace, tho at the &s;ame time they &s;hould forget no|thing
that may conduce to lead 'em in the way of
Virtue; becau&s;e the end that every Governor of a
Commonwealth ought to propo&s;e to him&s;elf is, to
act &s;o as to render all his Subjects virtuous. How
much more are Catholic Princes, who profe&s;s to
follow the Rules of Chri&s;t, oblig'd to govern their
Subjects according to his Precepts, and to remove
all the Ob&s;tacles that are likely to turn 'em out of
the way of Truth? In which Enterprize they cannot
&s;ucceed without giving 'em good and equal Laws,
and obliging 'em to an exact ob&s;ervance of 'em.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian Princes are moreover bound to exhort
their Subjects to &s;erve the true God, and to yield
obedience to the Doctrin of Chri&s;t, as much as
po&s;&s;ibly they can. And &s;eeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by un|ju&s;tly
retaining the <HI>Indians</HI> in &s;lavery, are continually
in the habit of a mortal Sin, and con&s;equently don't
live according to the Laws of Chri&s;t, our Kings
ought to command 'em to relea&s;e all the <HI>Indians,</HI>
that they may remove this great Ob&s;tacle which lies
in the way of their Subjects Salvation. The Royal
Character of Princes obliges 'em to make Laws and
Regulations, that Ju&s;tice may be maintain'd, and
the People &s;ubject to their Government pre&s;erv'd
in the practice of Virtue; and are likewi&s;e requir'd
by the Divine Law to employ their temporal Power
for the augmentation of the Catholic Church, and
<PB N="182" REF="101">
the maintenance of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;ciplin, that the
Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity may not rebel again&s;t the
Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. In this they may lawfully em|ploy
the terror of their Arms, to keep all People
to their Duty; for otherwi&s;e Temporal Powers
would not be nece&s;&s;ary for the admini&s;tration of the
Affairs of the Church. From hence it may fairly
be concluded, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ought to u&s;e
his power to render Ju&s;tice to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who
are &s;o tyrannically oppre&s;s'd, and to &s;trengthen the
hands of the Mini&s;ters of the Church in the <HI>Indies</HI>
by his Authority, who are not able to make any
progre&s;s by their Mini&s;try among the Natives, nor
to reclaim the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Vices, while they
are &s;uffer'd to afflict and per&s;ecute the poor <HI>Indians,</HI>
becau&s;e the&s;e continual Violences, and their fix'd
re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t in 'em, are habitual Sins. At
pre&s;ent they regard not at all the Remon&s;trances and
Menaces of Prelats, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures, but
go on adding Sin to Sin, in &s;o much that the Church
in the <HI>Indies</HI> is in a forlorn condition, and under
great difficulties: &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI> ought to be &s;et
free, that the Ob&s;tructions lying in the way of their
Salvation may be remov'd, and that they may the
better be engag'd to &s;ubmit to the Doctrin that is
preach'd to 'em: For by this means Chri&s;tian
Pa&s;tors will have a full liberty to exerci&s;e their Mi|ni&s;try,
and to di&s;charge their Apo&s;tolic Functions.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops of <HI>America</HI> are oblig'd by the Law
of God continually to &s;ollicit his Maje&s;ty and his
Royal Council to deliver the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Op|pre&s;&s;ion
under which they groan, and to give 'em
their former Liberty, becau&s;e the&s;e Bi&s;hops are ne|ce&s;&s;arily
engag'd by their Character to do the be&s;t
they can for the di&s;charge of their Pa&s;toral Office,
which con&s;i&s;ts in governing and teaching the People
under their Conduct, and in providing for all their
<PB N="183" REF="101">
&s;piritual nece&s;&s;ities; as al&s;o in &s;ecuring 'em as well as
they can from any temporal Injury, and in re&s;cuing
'em from the hands of Oppre&s;&s;ors, e&s;pecially when
the Vexations they &s;uffer are &s;o many &s;tumbling
blocks in the way of their Salvation. Nor ought
they to be wanting in procuring 'em all the tempo|ral
Advantages they can.</P>
<P>The Dominican and Franci&s;can Friers are very pi|ous
and prudent, and de&s;erve to be highly commend|ed,
in that they have agreed to refu&s;e ab&s;olution to
all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>New Spain,</HI> who keep <HI>Indian</HI>
Slaves, and to oblige 'em to bring this affair under
examination before the Royal Council, in con|formity
to the Laws newly made; tho they would
have done better not to have had recour&s;e to this
Tribunal. The&s;e Monks know very well by experi|ence
what unju&s;t and deceitful Methods have been
us'd to in&s;lave the <HI>Indians,</HI> and can't doubt but God
has been highly offended by the&s;e Violences, and
that tho&s;e who have committed 'em are oblig'd to
repair the Injuries of which they have been guilty.
A Confe&s;&s;or who undertakes to hear Mens Confe&s;&s;i|ons,
one who officiates in quality of a Bi&s;hop or
Curat as a &s;piritual Judg, ought to under&s;tand the
Obligations of his Mini&s;try, and to have that know|ledg
and prudence which is requi&s;ite to perform it
after a becoming manner, that he may pa&s;s a wi&s;e
and ju&s;t Judgment on all matters propos'd to him,
and rightly di&s;cern what wrong is offer'd to any op|pre&s;&s;ed
Party. If his ignorance or negligence is the
cau&s;e of his Mi&s;take, &s;o that he obliges not his Pe|nitent
to re&s;tore any ill-gotten goods, he commits a
great Sin, and is him&s;elf bound to make re&s;tituti|on
and amends for the Inju&s;tice done the offended
Party: Ju&s;t as a Phy&s;ician who has through igno|rance
done &s;ome con&s;iderable Mi&s;chief to his Pa|tient,
or occa&s;ion'd his death, ought to make &s;ome
<PB N="184" REF="102">
&s;pecial Reparation for his fault. The &s;ame may
be &s;aid of Judges that pa&s;s an unrighteous Sen|tence,
while they are ignorant of the Law, or take
no care to inform them&s;elves of the merit of the
Cau&s;e before 'em, becau&s;e &s;uch neglect and igno|rance
are criminal, and they ought to know the
matters on which they are intru&s;ted to pa&s;s a Judg|ment.</P>
<P>'Tis certain all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons in <HI>New
Spain</HI> are well a&s;&s;ur'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> have been in|&s;lav'd,
and are &s;till kept in bondage, contrary to all
Law and Equity; and therefore are not oblig'd to
refer the Examination of this Affair to the Royal
Council: be&s;ides, there are all &s;orts of tricks and
devices u&s;ed to divert the Council from taking cog|nizance
of the matter, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e
vexatious Practices. His Maje&s;ty ought with all
&s;peed to i&s;&s;ue out his Orders for the relea&s;e of the&s;e
mi&s;erable People, and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e
the oppre&s;&s;ion they are under is the occa&s;ion of the
ruin of an infinit number of Souls. And this is the
only way to reclaim the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the habit of
a mortal Sin, and to put the Prelats in a conditi|on
freely to acquit them&s;elves of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Functions.</P>
<P>Among all the Expedients Frier <HI>Don Bartholomew
de La&s;-Ca&s;as,</HI> Bi&s;hop of the Royal City of <HI>Chiapa,</HI>
propos'd for the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace and Tran|quillity
in <HI>America,</HI> the mo&s;t effectual was that of
directly &s;ubjecting all the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to the Crown
of <HI>Spain,</HI> that &s;o the Spani&s;h Lords might be uncapa|ble
of making the <HI>Indians</HI> their own Subjects and
Va&s;&s;als. And he &s;upported this Propo&s;al with many
very cogent Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he &s;ays, the Princes and People of the New
World being Infidels, and their Conver&s;ion to our
<PB N="185" REF="102">
holy Faith appearing nece&s;&s;ary, 'tis very proper
they &s;hould be under the Protection of a Catholic
and powerful King, who has a true zeal for the ho|nor
and propagation of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and
might &s;end able Mi&s;&s;ionaries into the New World,
to bring tho&s;e Idolaters to the knowledg of the true
God, and to embrace our Divine Religion, and &s;ub|mit
them&s;elves to the Holy See. And hence it ap|pears
that nothing can be more advantageous to the
<HI>Indians,</HI> than to put them&s;elves under the protecti|on
of Catholic Princes, that no particular Lords
may be capable of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 'em as their
Property. This is what the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> ought
to regard, without &s;haring with any others that Pow|er
and Authority they have acquired over the <HI>In|dians;</HI>
for they ought to pre&s;erve this Juri&s;diction
immediately to them&s;elves, and not divide it to in|ve&s;t
private Men with it. And this is an Affair of
&s;o great con&s;equence, that no le&s;s than both the
temporal and eternal Welfare of tho&s;e Nations de|pend
on it; for the Conver&s;ion of the New World
would be a very advantageous thing to the Com|monwealth.</P>
<P>'Tis neither ju&s;t nor po&s;&s;ible to abandon this Juri&s;|diction
to private Per&s;ons, &s;ince none but the King
can be inve&s;ted with it; becau&s;e when the Pope has
once made choice of any Per&s;on or Power for this Af|fair,
it ought not to be delegated or entru&s;ted to ano|ther.
When he has in this matter declar'd him&s;elf
in favor of any Per&s;on illu&s;trious by his Character
and Merit, who has a perfect knowledg of any Cau&s;e
he may have to determin, 'tis to be pre&s;um'd he'l
pa&s;s &s;uch a Judgment as the Pope him&s;elf would
have done. Now 'tis manife&s;t that in the Ca&s;e in
que&s;tion we have a Per&s;on cloth'd with Grandeur and
Dignity, &s;eeing he is King of <HI>Spain,</HI> a very good
Chri&s;tian, and zealous for the Catholic Religion;
<PB N="186" REF="103">
and the matter is of great importance, becau&s;e it
concerns the preaching and propagation of the true
Faith and Wor&s;hip of God, the Conver&s;ion of nume|rous
Nations, and the Government of 'em; which
is to be admini&s;tred with Lenity and Prudence,
that Ju&s;tice may be maintain'd among 'em, and the
love of Virtue in&s;pir'd into 'em: which is an Em|ploy
too great for any but Soveraign Princes to
perform.</P>
<P>'Tis certain the Holy See has cho&s;en the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> to be entru&s;ted with the Government of the <HI>In|dies;</HI>
which may be prov'd by two con&s;iderable Cir|cum&s;tances.
The fir&s;t of which is the Clau&s;e added
in the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>We rely upon your Fidelity, Prudence
and Ju&s;tice:</HI> which is in&s;erted in the Bull of Grant
and Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Indies</HI> to the mo&s;t &s;erene Kings
of <HI>Spain,</HI> wherein the Pope &s;ays in expre&s;s Terms;</P>
<P><Q>Knowing you to be Kings truly Catholic, as we
have been a&s;&s;ur'd by many experiences, and that
your Piety is every where regarded throughout the
Chri&s;tian World, we doubt not but you will u&s;e
all the care and diligence you can for the Exaltati|on
and Increa&s;e of the Catholic Faith; as you have
&s;par'd no charge or pains to re&s;cue the Kingdom
of <HI>Grenada</HI> from the hands of <HI>Sarazens</HI> and Infidels,
which has &s;o much conduc'd to the Glory of the
name of God.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd Circum&s;tance is, that when any ex|pre&s;s
Order is added in the Commi&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t
Clau&s;e of it is expre&s;s'd in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>We exhort you by your Holy Bapti&s;m, which
obliges you to &s;ubmit to our Apo&s;tolic Orders;
and we conjure you by the Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion
in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you would generou&s;ly under|take
this Expedition, to engage the People of the
New World to embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion:
nor let any Hard&s;hips or Perils di&s;courage you, but
<PB N="187" REF="103">
put your tru&s;t in God, who will make your Work
&s;ucceed to his Glory.</Q></P>
<P>The other Clau&s;e contains a kind of Command,
and is thus expre&s;s'd;</P>
<P><Q>We command you in virtue of the holy Obe|dience
you owe us; and we doubt not but you
will undertake this Affair with a great deal of
zeal and fervor, and &s;end into the I&s;lands and
Continent Men fearing God, able, experienc'd,
and capable of in&s;tructing the Inhabitants of the
New World in the Catholic Faith, and of in&s;pir|ing
'em with the love of Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances make it &s;ufficiently appear,
that the Pope gave the charge of cau&s;ing the <HI>Indians</HI>
to be in&s;tructed to the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> in con&s;ide|ration
of the &s;ignal Services render'd the Church by
that Crown; nay, that he has oblig'd them to un|dertake
this good work by his expre&s;s Command to
apply them&s;elves to it, in virtue of the holy Obe|dience
they owe him.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this the&s;e Princes &s;olemnly engag'd
them&s;elves to &s;econd the Pope's de&s;igns with all their
Power: Their Promi&s;e was turn'd into a Covenant,
and became a formal Obligation on 'em; and con|&s;equently
'tis the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of the Kings of
<HI>Spain</HI> to be the Mini&s;ters of the Holy See in carry|ing
the Word of God into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and contribut|ing
all their Power to continue the work of convert|ing
the <HI>Indians:</HI> Their care &s;hould be extended to
their temporal as well as &s;piritual Concerns; and
they ought to neglect nothing that may be nece&s;&s;ary
for their pre&s;ervation or conver&s;ion. Nor is it law|ful
for the&s;e Princes to abdicate this Authority, and
dive&s;t them&s;elves of this Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Let your Maje&s;ty therefore plea&s;e to con&s;ider &s;e|riou&s;ly
how &s;trict and indi&s;pen&s;ible this Obligation
is; be pleas'd to remember that in the year 1499,
<PB N="188" REF="104">
when <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer and
Admiral of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> had permitted each
<HI>Spaniard</HI> that accompanied him to take one <HI>Indians</HI> in
recompence of the great Services done the Crown
of <HI>Spain</HI> in that Voyage, when tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> arriv'd
in <HI>Spain,</HI> your Maje&s;ty &s;o much re&s;ented it, that
'twas not ea&s;y to appea&s;e your Anger on that occa|&s;ion.
Your Maje&s;ty ask'd if the Admiral had power
to de&s;troy your Subjects; and commanded the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
to &s;end back to the <HI>Indies</HI> all the <HI>Indians</HI> they
had brought from thence on pain of Death. Ac|cordingly
they return'd in the year 1500, when
<HI>Francis Bobadilla</HI> went to take the Government of the
New World.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rea&s;on that proves your Maje&s;ty under

of your Crown, and not to &s;uffer the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in the lea&s;t to u&s;urp any thing in quality of
Lords and Ma&s;ters, is, that otherwi&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible

is no other than the publication of the Go&s;pel, to

all Impediments that oppo&s;e this end, by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing

the Go&s;pel among 'em for their Conver&s;ion. All
the World knows their exce&s;&s;ive Avarice makes 'em
unwilling to &s;uffer the Mi&s;&s;ionary Monks to preach
the Go&s;pel to the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom tho&s;e Tyrants look
upon as their Va&s;&s;als; becau&s;e the publication of the
Go&s;pel (they &s;ay) occa&s;ions a con&s;iderable damage
to 'em two ways. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the&s;e Monks make
the <HI>Indians</HI> lo&s;e too much time in hearing their In|&s;tructions;
the&s;e People (&s;ay they) are naturally
lazy and negligent, &s;o that when they are diverted
from their Work, 'tis hard to bring 'em to it again.
It has often happen'd when the Monks had got the
<HI>Indians</HI> together in their Church to in&s;truct 'em, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have come upon 'em, and taken away a
hundred or two by force, beating 'em cruelly to the
&s;candal of the re&s;t, in &s;pite of what the poor Monks
could &s;ay or do. And &s;uch Violences can't but ex|tremely
impede the Salvation of the <HI>Indians.</HI> Another
Di&s;advantage the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to receive from
the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> is, that when they are
once in&s;tructed in the Maxims of Chri&s;tianity, they
grow proud and untractable, and not &s;o capable to
&s;erve 'em: and is not this an open Confe&s;&s;ion that
their private Intere&s;t is dearer to 'em than the Sal|vation
of the&s;e Peoples Souls? The frame of their
mind is an habitual mortal Sin again&s;t Charity, the
Order of which they pervert, not only in not pro|moting
their Salvation them&s;elves, which they ought
every day to do, being oblig'd in Con&s;cience either
to in&s;truct 'em, or procure others to do &s;o; but
al&s;o in that they are &s;o far from acquitting them|&s;elves
of this duty, that with all their might they
hinder others from informing 'em, without being
afraid of the Judgments of that God, who will one
day &s;everely puni&s;h 'em for want of Charity to their
Neighbours, in witholding light from 'em, tho
<PB N="190" REF="105">
they have &s;o much need of Information. They
hinder the pious Mi&s;&s;ionaries from coming to preach
to 'em, le&s;t they &s;hould become acquainted with their
Vexations and Cruelties, which are &s;o great and
&s;trange, that the Monks are &s;eiz'd with horror when
the <HI>Indians</HI> relate 'em. And when they &s;ee with their
own Eyes how mi&s;erably the <HI>Indians</HI> are treated,
they make it their bu&s;ine&s;s (as they are bound in
duty to God) to oppo&s;e the&s;e Di&s;orders. They
&s;ometimes adverti&s;e the Judges of tho&s;e Tribunals
your Maje&s;ty has e&s;tabli&s;hed there of the&s;e things,
to &s;eek to redre&s;s 'em that way; tho the means hi|therto
u&s;ed have had very little effect; becau&s;e
the Governors and Judges having a great many <HI>In|dians</HI>
them&s;elves, to whom they are unmerciful and
cruel, abu&s;e their Power in oppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e poor
Creatures, cau&s;ing 'em to be puni&s;h'd rigorou&s;ly for
the &s;lighte&s;t faults. This is the true rea&s;on why the
Monks are look'd upon as &s;o many trouble&s;om Spies,
and the Enemies of their temporal Intere&s;t; &s;o
that they can't endure &s;o much as to &s;ee 'em, nor
would they willingly tolerate 'em in the Country,
but often cur&s;e 'em, and invent all &s;orts of Calum|nies
again&s;t 'em. The poor <HI>Indians</HI> almo&s;t de&s;pair
to &s;ee any end of their Mi&s;eries; and having nothing
to tru&s;t to but the Zeal and Charity of the Monks,
do love and reverence 'em as their Deliverers and
Protectors, &s;till putting great Confidence in them
under all their troubles; they often come in Bodies
out of their Towns and Cities to meet 'em: But 'tis
a great mortification to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>In|dians</HI>
pay the&s;e good Men &s;o much re&s;pect; and
they take occa&s;ion from hence to reproach 'em,
pretending the Monks de&s;ign to make them&s;elves
the Lords and Ma&s;ters of the&s;e poor Wretches. But
God only knows what Labors and Hard&s;hips the&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="105">
Mi&s;&s;ionaries undergo, and to what Extremity they
are often reduc'd by poverty and hunger; when
they undertake great Journeys with inexpre&s;&s;ible
fatigue, in rough and trouble&s;om ways, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;hew 'em the way of Salvation; and to
admoni&s;h the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of their enormous Sins, in
tormenting 'em &s;o many ways, in robbing and mur|dering
'em: all which Violences call for large re&s;ti|tution,
if they expect to be &s;av'd. Covetou&s;ne&s;s
and Inju&s;tice reign more in the <HI>Indies,</HI> than in all the
World be&s;ides; tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no ju&s;t right
nor power there, &s;ince they don't derive it of your
Maje&s;ty. The <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally timorous and
cowardly, or rather the ill Treatments and Cruel|ties
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have terrified 'em to that de|gree,
that con&s;ternation and dread are become na|tural
to 'em, in&s;omuch that they &s;carce remember
they are Men.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for Men in their Condition to ap|ply
them&s;elves to hear the preaching of the Go&s;pel,
that &s;o they might become Chri&s;tians, &s;ince the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e it; who ought there|fore
to give up the Title they have u&s;urp'd over
them, ever &s;ince they made a Conque&s;t of 'em, as
they are wont to boa&s;t. They that have any Intere&s;t
in a Governor's favor, di&s;po&s;e of the Per&s;ons of
the <HI>Indians</HI> as their proper Goods, and divide 'em
among them&s;elves, as if they were born ab&s;olute
Va&s;&s;als. Two or three <HI>Spaniards</HI> will &s;ometimes
appropriate to them&s;elves a whole Nation of <HI>Indi|ans.</HI>
It may be the Ma&s;ter of the Family falls to
the Lot of one, his Wife to another, and their
Children to a third. They are &s;ent to the Mines
loaded like Hor&s;es, and forc'd to carry heavy Bur|dens
a hundred or two hundred Leagues; this is
&s;een every day. To obviate the&s;e Di&s;orders, it
<PB N="192" REF="106">
will not be &s;ufficient that your Maje&s;ty demand your
Tributes, and threaten tho&s;e with &s;evere Puni&s;h|ment
who &s;hall pre&s;ume to torment the <HI>Indians</HI> for
the future, or exact &s;uch Tasks of 'em as they are
not ju&s;tly oblig'd to perform; for they'l &s;till per&s;i&s;t
in the &s;ame cour&s;e.</P>
<P>As the &s;evere Bondage of the <HI>Indians</HI> is a great
ob&s;tacle to their Conver&s;ion on the one hand, &s;o on
the other is the cour&s;e taken to di&s;per&s;e 'em at a
di&s;tance one from another, whereby 'tis almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
to a&s;&s;emble a con&s;iderable number of 'em.
Both the&s;e ways prevent their being in&s;tructed in
our Religion, and put in the way of Salvation.
'Tis nece&s;&s;ary in order to their being fed with the
Divine Word, that they live in Society, and be in
a condition to be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled; and 'tis as ne|ce&s;&s;ary
they &s;hould enjoy an entire Liberty, that
they might voluntarily embrace the Word of God.
The Learned &s;ay there was no Sy&s;tem of written
Laws given by God in the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> becau&s;e
the Church was his Family, and did not con&s;i&s;t of any
whole Nation. Nor did God &s;ee good to give his
Law to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> while in <HI>Egypt,</HI> tho they were
then a numerous People, and computed to be no le&s;s
than &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Men able to bear Arms,
becau&s;e they were not a free People, being yet in
Captivity. But the Almighty gave 'em his Law
when the&s;e two conditions were found in 'em to|gether,
namely, when they were both Numerous and
Free; which was not till he had employ'd his Power
to deliver 'em from the Yoke of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But of
all Laws, that of the Go&s;pel e&s;pecially requires
both the&s;e Conditions, becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es Per&s;ons
at liberty to &s;eek to be in&s;tructed in it, and to put
the Precepts of it in practi&s;e. And 'tis very pro|per
for tho&s;e that ob&s;erve the Laws of Chri&s;t to
<PB N="193" REF="106">
incorporate them&s;elves and live in Societies, that
they may perform the &s;olemn Acts of Divine Wor|&s;hip
by the practice of the &s;even Sacraments and
other Ceremonies of the Church. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary
for Chri&s;tians to meet together from time to time
in public to hear the Word of God, and a&s;&s;i&s;t at
other parts of his Wor&s;hip, that &s;o new Converts
may be confirm'd in the manner of Life they have
embrac'd; for without the&s;e helps they would in|&s;en&s;ibly
decline in their Zeal, and might come even
to lo&s;e their Faith. In &s;hort, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
permitted to keep the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;catter'd up and down
on the Mountains, and in the Vallies, and to employ
'em perpetually in performing the unrea&s;onable
Tasks they exact of 'em, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to
in&s;truct 'em in our Religion to any purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By what has been &s;aid, your Maje&s;ty may very well
conceive what Di&s;orders reign in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
how nece&s;&s;ary 'tis to hinder the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from re|taining
the Natives under &s;o &s;evere a Yoke, and
from proceeding to depopulate the Country as they
have hitherto done. And that which is yet more
deplorable, is, that they &s;uffer 'em to die without
taking care to have the Sacraments admini&s;ter'd to
'em, having no more regard for 'em than for Dogs
or Hor&s;es. One would think they believ'd the&s;e
People to have no immortal Souls, but were uncapa|ble
of Rewards or Puni&s;hments in the other Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are no way qualified either to be
Lords and Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to teach 'em
the Doctrin of the Go&s;pel, or to induce 'em to im|brace
it by their Examples. A con&s;iderable num|ber
of <HI>Indians</HI> were committed to the care of <HI>John
Colmenero</HI> to be in&s;tructed in our Religion, tho he
was &s;o ignorant that he knew not well how to make
the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, or give any tolerable account
of his own Faith; in &s;o much that when he was ask'd
<PB N="194" REF="107">
what he taught tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> under his Conduct, he
could make no other An&s;wer than that he taught
'em to make the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, but pronounc'd
the words wrong that are us'd in that Ceremony.
When the <HI>Indians</HI> of one Province had brought all
their Idols to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, with Prote&s;tations that
they now dete&s;ted that impious Wor&s;hip, and were
re&s;olv'd to &s;erve the true God for time to come,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;old the&s;e very Idols to other <HI>Indians,</HI>
or exchang'd 'em for Slaves. What concern of Mind
can the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be &s;uppos'd to have for the Salva|tion
of the&s;e People, when they only de&s;ign to en|rich
them&s;elves, and thereby to be qualified for Em|ployments
above their Rank; and when they are
&s;o ignorant, that they don't know the Creed, or ten
Commandments? They are &s;ordidly covetous, and
indeed give them&s;elves up to all &s;orts of Vices; &s;o
that their Lives are infamous and abominable. The
<HI>Indians</HI> are comparatively more hone&s;t and virtuous
than they are: for tho they are Pagans and Idola|ters,
yet are content with one Wife, as Nature
teaches 'em, while they &s;ee Chri&s;tians take fourteen
or fifteen Women, how expre&s;ly &s;oever the Law
they profe&s;s forbids it. Many of the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;carce
know what it is to rob one another, to offer Vio|lence
to any one, or to commit Murder: Whereas
they &s;ee the Chri&s;tians guilty of all the&s;e, again&s;t
all Rea&s;ons and Ju&s;tice, and that they violate all their
Oaths, &s;o that there is no ground to put the lea&s;t
confidence in 'em. The poor <HI>Indians</HI> that are Wit|ne&s;&s;es
of the Crimes of &s;uch as call them&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, think the God they wor&s;hip is the vile&s;t
and mo&s;t unju&s;t God in the world, becau&s;e he does
not immediately inflict &s;ome &s;ignal Puni&s;hment on
tho&s;e that pretend to &s;erve him, for their flagitious
Lives. They al&s;o think your Maje&s;ty the mo&s;t cruel
of all Princes, becau&s;e your Subjects are &s;o abomi|nably
<PB N="195" REF="107">
vicious; they fancy (as I have before &s;aid)
that your Maje&s;ty drinks human Blood, and eats
the Fle&s;h of Men. And tho the&s;e things may ap|pear
&s;trange and &s;urprizing to your Maje&s;ty, they
are no news to us who have been accu&s;tom'd to 'em.
And we can't but wonder, that &s;ome extraordinary
marks of the Divine Anger and Indignation have
not been inflicted on <HI>Spain</HI> to make her &s;mart for
the Crimes committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may by this time very well perceive
the Character of tho&s;e Men to whom the charge and
care of the Souls of the <HI>Indians</HI> is committed. And
'tis no wonder that there's &s;o little done either for
their temporal or &s;piritual Advantage, &s;ince the di&s;|covery
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> under &s;uch Conduct. God is
no more known there now than he was before, un|le&s;s
it be in the Province of <HI>Mexico.</HI> And that
&s;light In&s;truction the People have had there has co&s;t
'em very dear: Tho the Son of God commanded
his Di&s;ciples to give that freely which they had
freely receiv'd. The <HI>Indians</HI> were committed to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on condition they would undertake to
teach 'em the Chri&s;tian Religion: therefore &s;ince
they have acquitted them&s;elves &s;o ill of that Com|mi&s;&s;ion,
they ought to make re&s;titution of all they
have taken from 'em under this pretext. However,
God will not be mocked, who &s;ees all things, and is
a witne&s;s of all the wicked Actions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s only to torment
and in&s;lave the&s;e poor People in&s;tead of taking
care to inform 'em of the Truth. And indeed
the&s;e &s;ecular Men are not very proper to be made
Preachers of the Go&s;pel. Your Maje&s;ty has been
ill &s;erv'd in not having had good Information given
you of the ill deportment of your Subjects. For
'tis not to be doubted but your Maje&s;ty would
<PB N="196" REF="108">
have provided a Remedy, if due care had been
taken to give you advice of it: Or if your Maje&s;ty
had not done it, you would have very much wrong'd
your Con&s;cience in &s;ending &s;uch Men into the new
World to preach the Faith, and give te&s;timony to
the Doctrin of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who are ab&s;olutely un|capable
of &s;o honourable a Mini&s;try, and even de|cry
and deba&s;e it by their &s;candalous Conver&s;ation.
'Tis therefore nece&s;&s;ary that this Employment be
taken away from Secular, and committed to Reli|gious
Per&s;ons, as agreeing better with their Cha|racter,
which may be done without giving the&s;e
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Mini&s;ters any occa&s;ion to claim a tem|poral
Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Indians;</HI> for if that
&s;hould be allow'd, we &s;hould fall into the &s;ame In|conveniences
we are endeavouring to avoid. The
corrupt Lives and evil Examples of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
do more hurt than the preaching of an infinit
number of Prie&s;ts and Monks can do good. There|fore
your Maje&s;ty is oblig'd in Con&s;cience to de|prive
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the power they u&s;urp over
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and never &s;uffer 'em to make 'em their
Va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>One principal Rea&s;on that proves this Propo&s;i|tion
is, that People ought to enjoy Peace and Tran|quillity,
that they may be in a condition to at|tend
the Wor&s;hip of God, and the good Works
pre&s;crib'd by the Chri&s;tian Religion, and not to be
diverted from the Sacraments by being condemn'd
to continual Labor. Which &s;tate of Peace and
Re&s;t can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t without pre&s;erving to every Man
his Property, and guarding him from all the a&s;&s;aults
of Injury and Inju&s;tice. The Governors of Com|monwealths
are bound by the Law of God to re|move
out of the way all Ob&s;tructions to &s;o nece&s;&s;ary
a Peace, and &s;peedily to allay tho&s;e Di&s;&s;en&s;ions and
Troubles that may continue Di&s;cord among &s;uch as
<PB N="197" REF="108">
profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e 'tis directly oppo&s;it to
the end of God in creating Men; for he &s;ends 'em
into the World to ob&s;erve his Commands, and to
apply them&s;elves to the exerci&s;e of Religion and
good Works, that they may thereby merit eternal
Life. This good order is nece&s;&s;ary in every Chri&s;ti|an
Republic, but there e&s;pecially where the Chri&s;tian
Faith has been but lately entertain'd. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are too covetous and &s;elf-intere&s;ted to have any
Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Indians</HI> granted 'em, becau&s;e
they'l never give 'em any re&s;pit or repo&s;e, but go
on to rob and torment 'em all the ways they can in|vent.
There is no kind of Inju&s;tice but they com|mit
it to &s;poil the&s;e poor People, and therefore
there is no way to &s;helter 'em from their Oppre&s;|&s;ions,
but by annexing the <HI>Indies</HI> to the proper In|heritance
of your Maje&s;ty's Crown. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
kill the <HI>Indians</HI> with impunity in the Fields, in the
High-ways, and in the Mines, and do it more bold|ly,
becau&s;e many times there are no Witne&s;&s;es pre|&s;ent
to convict 'em of their Cruelties. So that no|thing
can be more evident, than that the <HI>Indians</HI> are
not in a condition to compo&s;e their Minds to at|tend
to the Divine Word, &s;o as to be induc'd to
obey the Divine Commands, while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
their ab&s;olute Lords, who will continually hara&s;s
'em with endle&s;s Trouble and Per&s;ecution, which
will fill their minds with Angui&s;h and Vexation, and
all kinds of Mi&s;ery, nay with an aver&s;ion to your
Maje&s;ty, and a great hatred to our God, and to his
Law, which &s;eems to 'em &s;o &s;evere, &s;o heavy and
intolerable a Yoke. They can't but think your Ma|je&s;ty's
Government is tyrannical, as well as that the
God whom we adore is unju&s;t and unmerciful; &s;up|po&s;ing
him the Author of all the Violence they &s;uffer
from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> becau&s;e while they, on pretence
of preaching the Catholic Faith, bring &s;o many
<PB N="198" REF="109">
terrible Calamities upon 'em, their God &s;uffers this
without puni&s;hing their Inju&s;tice and Impiety after a
very remarkable manner. The&s;e unfortunate Peo|ple
have no other Relief than what they find in
their Tears, which they pour forth day and night,
prote&s;ting their own Gods were more kind and fa|vourable
than the God of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and &s;aying
they enjoy'd a &s;ettl'd Peace, and all the Cove|niences
of Life while they &s;erv'd their own Gods,
whereas ever &s;ince they had been under the power
of the Chri&s;tians, they had been expos'd to all man|ner
of Abu&s;es. This makes 'em abhor the Catholic
Faith, and by con&s;equence puts tho&s;e that preach
to 'em out of a condition to attain their end: So
that your Maje&s;ty is beyond all que&s;tion oblig'd by
the Law of God to re&s;cue the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Yoke
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to take 'em under your own
Protection.</P>
<P>I farther add, that the power your Maje&s;ty has
over the People of the New World, has been
granted you by the Grace of God and the Suffrage
of the Church, both for the temporal and eternal
Advantage of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which Privilege is a kind
of nece&s;&s;ary means of their Salvation. So that the
Government of 'em belongs of right to none but
your Maje&s;ty, with the exclu&s;ion of all other Powers
what&s;oever, unle&s;s they de&s;ire to fru&s;trate all the
Advantages both &s;piritual and temporal, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> might hope to reap from the Conver&s;ation
of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Your Maje&s;ty's Character and
Juri&s;diction over 'em engages you to remove all Ob|&s;tacles
that may hinder them from obtaining the&s;e
Advantages, and being &s;av'd through Faith by the
preaching of the Go&s;pel. Your Maje&s;ty ought not
to &s;uffer your Authority to become infamous and
odious, nor your Subjects to u&s;urp a tyrannical
Power that will infallibly i&s;&s;ue in the de&s;truction of
<PB N="199" REF="109">
the <HI>Indians,</HI> if they mu&s;t be Va&s;&s;als to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who treat 'em &s;o cruelly and inhumanly. When
we fir&s;t arriv'd in the New World, we &s;aw innu|merable
multitudes of People inhabiting the Pro|vinces
of <HI>New-Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</HI> and the I&s;le
of <HI>St. John,</HI> which are now all de&s;olate. The Pro|vinces
and Kingdoms of the Continent are in a yet
more deplorable condition, tho once as well peo|pled
as <HI>Toledo</HI> and <HI>Seville.</HI> There's &s;carce any place
in the World where Men and other Animals multi|ply
&s;o much as they do in the <HI>Indies,</HI> becau&s;e the
Air of the Country being temperate, favours Ge|neration.
But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have found out the
art of entirely depopulating large Countries fill'd
with infinit numbers of People, for they have un|ju&s;tly
ma&s;&s;acred &s;ome to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their
Gold and Silver, others they have de&s;troy'd by ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Labors, or by forcing them to carry unrea|&s;onable
Burdens in long Journies; in a word, they
have &s;acrific'd the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to enrich them&s;elves.
We advance nothing but the very Truth, and all
that we have &s;aid does not expre&s;s half of what we
have &s;een; nor will it be a difficult task to convince
them of fal&s;hood who dare maintain the contrary
before your Maje&s;ty. None but &s;uch as have &s;har'd
in the fruit of this Rapine and Cruelty, will oppo&s;e
the truth of &s;uch Facts as are known to all the
world. And 'twill be in vain to pretend that any
contagious Di&s;temper has made a Country of 2500
leagues de&s;olate, which before was very populous.</P>
<P>The manner of governing Kingdoms ought to be
conformable to the Law of God and Man, for the
good and profit of the People, who are to be de|fended
and pre&s;erv'd from the Violence and Inju&s;tice
of tho&s;e that are de&s;titute of the fear of God, and
u&s;e a tyrannical Power, merely obtain'd by U&s;ur|pation,
for the ruin and de&s;truction of tho&s;e that are
<PB N="200" REF="110">
under 'em. Your Maje&s;ty may ea&s;ily be inform'd
how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have abus'd the Power you grant|ed
'em for the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in turning
it to afflict and de&s;troy 'em with unexampled Cruel|ty.
And that which makes the ca&s;e yet more la|mentable
is, that none of tho&s;e who have been em|ploy'd
in your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice have ever given you
advice of the&s;e great Di&s;orders, tho &s;o very preju|dicial
to your Intere&s;t, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of an infi|nite
number of Souls who have peri&s;h'd in the dark|ne&s;s
of Pagani&s;m, out of which they might have
been ea&s;ily reduc'd if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had in the lea&s;t
been govern'd by the fear of God.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may plea&s;e to remember that one
Article of the Will of the mo&s;t Serene Queen <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI>
is expre&s;s'd after this manner:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> Since the time wherein the Apo&s;tolic See
granted us the I&s;les and Containent of the Ocean, it
has always been our principal Intention to cau&s;e
the Light of the Go&s;pel to &s;hine on the People of
the New World, and to &s;end Prelats and Monks
thither to convert and in&s;truct 'em in the truth of
the Catholic Faith. Therefore I be&s;eech my Lord
the King, and the Prince&s;s my Daughter, to labour
with all their might to render this Enterprize
&s;ucce&s;sful, and to &s;ecure the <HI>Indians</HI> from receiving
any damage either in their E&s;tates or Per&s;ons, but
on the contrary to take care they be treated with
all &s;orts of kindne&s;s; and that &s;trict and &s;peedy
Ju&s;tice be executed upon any one that &s;hall offer
'em the lea&s;t Injury, and to keep exactly to the
terms of the Apo&s;tolic Brief di&s;patched for this
Grant.</Q> The&s;e are the expre&s;s Words of that Il|lu&s;trious
Prince&s;s: And yet no &s;ooner was &s;he ex|pir'd,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to abu&s;e the <HI>Indians,</HI>
and to offer 'em all the Outrages of which we have
been &s;peaking, and could give your Maje&s;ty a more
ample Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="110">
To all the foregoing Rea&s;ons it may be added,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are declar'd Enemies to the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI>
and de&s;ign nothing but their de&s;truction, and
to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Country; which is &s;o un|doubted
a truth, that 'tis altogether needle&s;s to
prove it. For he is properly a Man's declar'd Ene|my,
who goes about to accu&s;e him of &s;ome ca|pital
Crime, that de&s;erves death; who deprives him
of his Liberty and the greate&s;t part of his Goods;
who makes a cruel War upon him and in&s;laves him;
who &s;eeks all Occa&s;ions to kill him, and takes away
his Wife and Children to in&s;lave 'em; who u&s;urps
all the Goods of his Relations when they die, and
unju&s;tly ravi&s;hes from him all that is dear to him.
Certainly &s;uch Violences as the&s;e are again&s;t the
Rights both of People and Princes; and 'tis &s;uffici|ent
to demon&s;trate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be the declared
Enemies of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they have done 'em all
the mi&s;chief which we have been relating. For
they have calumniated and accus'd 'em of the mo&s;t
horrible and infamous Crimes that can be imagin'd,
meerly to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their E&s;tates, and &s;trip
'em of all they had under this pretext; whereas the
practices they charge 'em with are purely imagi|nary,
and &s;uch as have never been &s;o much as heard
of in the great I&s;lands of <HI>New Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</HI>
and St. <HI>John,</HI> tho they have been all very populous;
for after the mo&s;t exact Enquiries we were able to
to make, we could never find the lea&s;t appea|rance
of tho&s;e abominable Sins, to which &s;ome few
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are addicted. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the Kingdom
of <HI>Yucatan</HI> know not what this unnatural Vice is.
Nor are there any great number of 'em that eat hu|man
Fle&s;h. They are farther accus'd of Idolatry;
but Men have no right to puni&s;h 'em for this Crime,
which ought to be left to the Judgment of God.
Our Ance&s;tors were formerly Idolaters, as the <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="111">
are now; and the whole Univer&s;e was pollu|ted
with this Sin before the coming of Chri&s;t, and
before the Apo&s;tles had preach'd the Chri&s;tian Faith.
For God di&s;pers'd them up and down the World to
di&s;&s;ipate the darkne&s;s that was &s;pread over the
Earth: and they did not employ violence and force
of Arms to puni&s;h Idolatry, or other Sins that were
the Con&s;equences of Infidelity; they made u&s;e of
nothing but the good Examples of their Virtue and
Holine&s;s, together with their Doctrin, which con|tain'd
the Menaces and Promi&s;es of the Word of
God; and we ought to do that in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which
they did in other parts of the World. This was the
Cour&s;e which Chri&s;t him&s;elf fir&s;t took, and then
oblig'd his Apo&s;tles to follow his Example. The
Son of God came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was
lo&s;t. Which of our Ance&s;tors could have been &s;av'd
if they had been put to death for Crimes commit|ted
in the time of their unbelief? the expre&s;s Words
of the Go&s;pel are contrary to this Method; for
Chri&s;t &s;ays to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer and to ri&s;e from the dead
the third day; and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of Sins
&s;hould be preach'd in his Name among all Nations, be|ginning
at</HI> Jeru&s;alem: <HI>And ye are Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e
things,</HI> Luke 24. 46, 47, 48. which evidently proves
that the Go&s;pel ought to be at fir&s;t preach'd to Infi|dels,
by declaring of Peace, and the remi&s;&s;ion of
Sins that are pa&s;t, &s;ince Chri&s;t has given no power
or permi&s;&s;ion to men to puni&s;h 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have moreover pre&s;um'd to main|tain
that the <HI>Indians</HI> were like brute Bea&s;ts, utterly
uncapable of di&s;ciplin, and unfit to receive the light
of Chri&s;tianity. Your Maje&s;ty has good rea&s;on to
puni&s;h tho&s;e that declare &s;uch notorious Fal&s;hoods:
For under this Colour they have obtain'd of your
Maje&s;ty a power to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the <HI>Indies</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="111">
as their ab&s;olute Property, and to do the <HI>Indians</HI> what
mi&s;chief they plea&s;e. Thus have they impos'd on
the Con&s;cience of the mo&s;t Catholic King; and ob|tain'd
leave to carry away the Inhabitants of the
I&s;lands and Countries that lie near <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and
have accordingly forc'd 'em out of their own Coun|try
again&s;t all Law and Equity; &s;o that an innume|rable
multitude both of Men and Women that in|habited
above fifty I&s;lands, &s;ome bigger than the <HI>Ca|naries,</HI>
have been de&s;troy'd, in&s;omuch that there are
but eleven Per&s;ons left. I have been an Eye-witne&s;s
of this de&s;olation, as well as <HI>Peter de Li&s;le,</HI> who is a
man of honor and credit, and now a Monk of the
Order of <HI>St. Francis.</HI> He built a Brigantine, and
man'd it with Sea-men to make a review of tho&s;e
once populous I&s;lands; and they found in all that
va&s;t Country but eleven People (as has been &s;aid)
tho they &s;pent two years in making this Voyage.
'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s to your Maje&s;ty,
on the one hand, the great meekne&s;s, goodne&s;s of
temper, and &s;incerity of the People of the New
World, and on the other, what enormous Rava|ges
and Cruelties the Chri&s;tians have exerci&s;ed up|on
'em. Your Bowels would be mov'd with Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
and your heart too much affected, if an ex|act
de&s;cription of all this were made you.</P>
<P>Cruel Wars have been rais'd in divers rich Pro|vinces,
without any fair occa&s;ion, but only to gratify
the covetous humour of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> At the &s;ame
time they flatter them&s;elves that they have Authority
from your Maje&s;ty to employ force and violence to
in&s;lave the&s;e People. And all the difference they make
between tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> they look upon as their Sub|jects,
and tho&s;e whom they treat as Slaves, is, that
they &s;ell the latter publicly, but u&s;e a little more for|mality
about &s;elling the former, by &s;eeking pretences
to hide their Inju&s;tice. In the unju&s;t Wars they have
<PB N="204" REF="112">
made with 'em, after having kill'd the Ma&s;ters of Fa|milies,
they have al&s;o murder'd their Wives and Chil|dren,
and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of all they had. And
God is now pleas'd every day to &s;hew us by his &s;evere
Cha&s;ti&s;ements that he has been grievou&s;ly offended
by the&s;e Robberies and Cruelties. The Welfare of
the <HI>Indians</HI> both as to Body and Soul is in the great|e&s;t
danger; for if they mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the ab&s;o|lute
Power of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they'l utterly de&s;troy
'em, without &s;paring any, &s;o much as to propagate
their Race. If the Law of Nature forbids us to
commit a Pupil to the charge of one that is a mor|tal
Enemy to him or his Parents, or has embezel'd
his E&s;tate, or &s;et him an ill Example; and yet he has
been given up to the care of a Per&s;on of this Cha|racter;
the Judges would be oblig'd to rectify the
matter, by taking him from under his Conduct,
whatever &s;ecurity he offers to give for his fidelity.
'Tis much the &s;ame ca&s;e with the <HI>Indians</HI> in re&s;pect of
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the&s;e would have it believ'd that
they are the Guardians, Tutors, and Protectors of
the other: tho 'tis only a fraudulent pretence to en|&s;nare
'em. The <HI>Indians</HI> know well enough how to
govern them&s;elves, without being beholden to Guar|dians;
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are no way capable of in|&s;tructing
'em in the things of Religion, which yet
is the main thing the <HI>Indians</HI> want, and the greate&s;t
kindne&s;s that can be done 'em. And 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee
what di&s;po&s;ition the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have towards 'em, as
to their temporal advantage. So that 'tis mo&s;t cer|tain
they are their declar'd Enemies; &s;ince they have
&s;trip'd 'em of all their Goods, offer'd all &s;orts of
abu&s;es to their Per&s;ons, and taken away their Wives
and Children, whom they have condemn'd to perpe|tual
Slavery; which cour&s;e, together with the cruel
Wars made upon 'em, has almo&s;t quite unpeopled the
New World. How is it po&s;&s;ible that men that lead
<PB N="205" REF="112">
&s;uch kind of Lives, &s;hould in&s;pire the <HI>Indians</HI> with
the de&s;ire of embracing the Law of God, and the
love of Virtue, e&s;pecially &s;eeing they many ways
per&s;ecute the very Monks, who are &s;o zealous for
the Reformation of the&s;e Idolaters? On the con|trary,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;pare nothing that may debauch
'em, and expo&s;e 'em to all &s;orts of Vice by the evil
Patterns they &s;et 'em: They teach 'em to &s;wear and
bla&s;pheme the holy Name of God, tho in reality the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> don't do it de&s;ignedly, but only becau&s;e
they hear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;e &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions. 'Tis
therefore plain that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ought not to have
any Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Indians,</HI> if their advantage
either as to this Life or that to come be con&s;ider'd,
&s;eeing they are the mortal Enemies of this People,
and think of nothing but how to de&s;troy 'em. It
would therefore be a piece of great Inju&s;tice to
abandon 'em to &s;uch Men, when their Di&s;po&s;ition
toward 'em is &s;o well known; it being a mortal Sin
to expo&s;e one's Neighbor to evident danger of
lo&s;ing his Life: And we doubt not but your Maje&s;ty
will be cautious of falling under the guilt of &s;uch a
Crime, and not give up the <HI>Indians</HI> to the fury of
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>All ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Laws, and tho&s;e Philo&s;o|phers
that have written on Morality are again&s;t
placing any Government in the hands of nece&s;&s;itous
and covetous Men, who&s;e greate&s;t end is to get rid
of their Poverty, and to deliver them&s;elves from
that mean condition in which they live, and there|fore
are ready to &s;acrifice all the obligations of
Duty to the de&s;ire they have of becoming rich.
And becau&s;e this greedy Pa&s;&s;ion is continually in|crea&s;ing,
and their Minds are wholly &s;et on the ways
of heaping up Wealth, and filling their Che&s;ts, they
find no re&s;t but in &s;atisfying their Avarice. They
abhor Poverty as Nature does a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and there|fore
<PB N="206" REF="113">
have no other thoughts night or day but to
contrive means of ama&s;&s;ing together as much Trea|&s;ure
as they can. Upon this account the Philo&s;opher
determins that 'tis a dangerous thing to put Nations
or Provinces under the Government of &s;uch as are
covetous or needy, who are re&s;olv'd to be rich at
any rate in the world. We are inform'd in Hi&s;to|ry
that the <HI>Romans</HI> being about to &s;end two Con&s;uls
to govern <HI>Spain,</HI> one of whom was poor and the
other covetous; when this Affair was propos'd to
the Senat, <HI>Scipio Africanus</HI> gave his opinion that
neither of 'em was proper to make a Governor,
there being rea&s;on to fear that both would abu&s;e
their Authority to feather their Ne&s;ts out of the
public Stock; becau&s;e &s;uch kind of Per&s;ons are like
Leeches in a Commonwealth, and make it their
principal care to gather &s;omething on every &s;ide,
and to devour the Sub&s;tance of the People, making
them&s;elves rich at their charge, becau&s;e their
covetous De&s;ires can never be &s;atiated as long as
they remain in this World: Nay it mu&s;t be ad|ded,
that this Vice mo&s;t commonly proves incura|ble;
&s;o that if Men greedy of Lucre get Authority
over any People, they will not fail to &s;poil and ruin
'em, becau&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ion that animates 'em, keeps no
bounds or mea&s;ures. No Laws nor Penalties with
which they can be menaced, will be &s;trong enough
to re&s;train 'em, as long as they are inve&s;ted with
Power; and the more &s;ucce&s;sful any covetous Man
finds his Indu&s;try to be, the more earne&s;tly does he
de&s;ire and pur&s;ue Riches, which he accounts the
&s;upreme Good. The de&s;ire of being rich produces
much the &s;ame effect in the mind of a poor cove|tous
Man, as the hope of Cele&s;tial Happine&s;s would
in that of a good Man; for as this perfectly fills up
the Capacity of his Mind that ardently wi&s;hes for
it, &s;o the Mi&s;er's Soul can de&s;ire nothing be&s;ides
<PB N="207" REF="113">
hoards of Trea&s;ure, wherein his Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts,
becau&s;e Money an&s;wers all things: For this is that
which capacitates Men to undertake the greate&s;t
Enterprizes, and to obtain whatever they de&s;ire in
this World, the highe&s;t Employments, Honors and
Dignities, co&s;tly Habit, and the mo&s;t delicious Dain|ties;
this facilitates their commi&s;&s;ion of all &s;orts of
Crimes, gives 'em opportunity to be reveng'd on
their Enemies, to acquaint them&s;elves with Per&s;ons
of great Quality, and to obtain their Favour and
E&s;teem. 'Tis on the&s;e accounts that the Men of the
world &s;eek it with all their might, and expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to &s;o many Fatigues and Perils, as well as per|petrate
the greate&s;t Villanies to procure it.</P>
<P>Now the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Riches can never &s;atisfy
the Soul, &s;o as to give it perfect content; for 'tis
perpetually craving what it does not yet po&s;&s;e&s;s.
Therefore the Worldling, who has cho&s;en Mony
for his chief Good and la&s;t End, is indifferent as to
other things, but devotes him&s;elf entirely to this,
employing all his care and diligence to increa&s;e his
Bags; and his thir&s;t of Gold grows more and more
violent, by how much the more his E&s;tate &s;wells,
according to the Philo&s;opher's Maxim, that Motion
is by &s;o much the more impetuous, by how much
the nearer it approaches its end.</P>
<P>Avarice is a more incurable Evil than Concupi&s;|cence,
becau&s;e its Object, and the things it promi&s;es
attract the Hearts of Men with greater violence;
and the power of Mony is of a larger extent, be|cau&s;e
it puts a Man in a condition to gratify his
Lu&s;t, whereas this on the other hand can't procure
him Riches. The love of Mony endures longer on
the Mind than the Appetite of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures,
how violent and impetuous &s;oever they may be for
a time. Covetou&s;ne&s;s is always on the advance, and
&s;eldom extingui&s;h'd but with a Man's Life: For the
<PB N="208" REF="114">
more a Man's natural Infirmites increa&s;e, the more
the de&s;ire of heaping up Wealth fortifies it &s;elf; as
'tis ob&s;ervable in old Men, that the nearer they ap|proach
their end, the more covetous they u&s;ually
grow; becau&s;e as their Health and Strength gra|dually
dimini&s;h, they think they have the more need
of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the things of this World.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons make it evident, that if any Ju|ri&s;diction
or Government be given to covetous Men,
they will not fail to oppre&s;s and vex tho&s;e that are
&s;ubjected to them, that they may make them&s;elves
rich at their co&s;ts; and that nothing will hinder 'em
from gratifying their Avarice whenever they have
a fair occa&s;ion; for this Vice is the root and &s;pring
of all others, 'tis the &s;ource of Trea&s;on, Fraud,
Perjury, Violence, Rapine, and barbarous Cruelty.
This Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;aid to be blind, becau&s;e it occa&s;ions
blindne&s;s in the Mind, and benights the Rea&s;on with
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Darkne&s;s, and hinders him that is cap|tivated
with it from perceiving his danger. The
&s;ight of Gold, tho it cau&s;es the commi&s;&s;ion of all
manner of Crimes, and is the &s;ource of Calumnies,
gives him more Joy than the light of the Sun, be|cau&s;e
he finds his Account in the ruin of others.
It excludes Fidelity, and bani&s;hes Union and Con|cord
out of the World; it violates Charity, and
produces all manner of Mi&s;chief; it knows no Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
but induces Men to di&s;claim their very Pa|rents,
and break all the ties of Faith and Amity;
it never &s;uffers a Man to &s;ympathize with his Neigh|bour's
Mi&s;eries, but even makes him di&s;regard his
Relations as if utterly unacquainted with them.
The covetous Man never forgives him&s;elf his own
Expences, and leads a mi&s;erable Life in the mid&s;t of
Plenty and Wealth. This greedy humor &s;o darkens
the Under&s;tandings of tho&s;e that are bewitch'd by it,
that they know not how to make a right Judgment
<PB N="209" REF="114">
of any thing, but in&s;tead of following the Dictates
of rea&s;on, are on all occa&s;ions driven down the im|petuous
Current of their beloved Vice, all their
Thoughts and De&s;ires are directed this way, and
yet they can never quench the in&s;atiable Thir&s;t that
preys upon their Souls.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now apply all the&s;e Rea&s;ons to the &s;ub|ject
in hand: and I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to give
attention to the Con&s;equences I draw from 'em.
All the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that leave their own Country to
go into the <HI>Indies</HI> are poor, and 'tis only Avarice
that drives them thither; for they don't only pre|tend
to rai&s;e them&s;elves a little above a condition of
Poverty and Want, but to ama&s;s va&s;t Trea&s;ures to|gether,
without &s;etting any Limits to their unmea|&s;urable
Covetou&s;ne&s;s, that they may be able to buy
honorable Offices and Emploiments, and advance
them&s;elves far above their degree. We have been
taught by experience that in a few years, many <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
who were in the meane&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t condition,
and always led a mi&s;erable Life, have con&s;iderably
alter'd their fortune by the Riches they have brought
from the New World, and likewi&s;e introduc'd
great corruption of Manners throughout all <HI>Spain.</HI>
The love of Mony is now grown to that height,
that Gold and Silver &s;eem the only Gods that are
wor&s;hip'd. They that know not how to advance
them&s;elves by indu&s;try and labor, do it by plundring
and robbing without any fear of puni&s;hment. They
take away from the poor <HI>Indians</HI> all they find in their
hou&s;es, and after all make 'em work to get &s;till more
out of their &s;weat and labor; &s;o that if any Autho|rity
over the <HI>Indians</HI> be allow'd 'em, they'l certainly
abu&s;e it to enrich them&s;elves, while this dete&s;table
covetou&s;ne&s;s reigns in their minds. And what can
the poor <HI>Indians</HI> do to &s;hake off their tyrannical
Yoke, &s;ince they are naturally meek, quiet and timo|rous,
<PB N="210" REF="115">
and dare not complain or murmur; or if they
&s;hould, have no body to hearken to 'em or defend
'em? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have an ab&s;olute Power,
are always chiding and domineering over 'em wher|ever
they are, in the Fields, on the Mountains, in
the Mines, in the De&s;arts, or in the High-Ways.
They take all the furniture of their Hou&s;es from
'em, which is their greate&s;t Riches, as well as ex|po&s;e
'em to the greate&s;t dangers, and mo&s;t intolera|ble

Puni&s;hments for the lea&s;t Trifle, when they

then mu&s;t it be to abandon &s;uch meek
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Creatures to the fury of &s;uch men
as the&s;e, when they are in no capacity to re&s;i&s;t the
tyranny of their Per&s;ecutors, but are made their

<P>What would one &s;ay of that Judg, who after
he has received information of the violent pa&s;&s;ion of
a wild Spark in the heat of Youth, to a beautiful
Virgin, &s;hould notwith&s;tanding order 'em to live to|gether
in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and give him an ab&s;olute
power over her, but withal threatning to puni&s;h
him &s;everely if he offer'd her any violence? Could
any one &s;afely confide in the Promi&s;es of &s;uch a man
as this, whatever Prote&s;tations he &s;hould make of
moderating his pa&s;&s;ion on &s;o critical an occa&s;ion? It
is not to be doubted but &s;uch a Judg would commit
a mortal Sin, in thus expo&s;ing his Neighbour to &s;o
dangerous a Temptation, tho he &s;hould happen to
ab&s;tain from the Sin to which he has &s;o great a pro|pen&s;ion.
It almo&s;t amounts to the &s;ame thing to
put the <HI>Indians</HI> under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
who are their mortal Enemies; for if they
don't ma&s;&s;acre 'em in cold blood meerly out of the
hatred they bear 'em, they do it however to get
their Goods, and rob 'em of their Trea&s;ure. And
<PB N="211" REF="115">
as in the former In&s;tance it would be next to a Mi|racle
for that amorous Youth not to abandon him|&s;elf
to the Conduct of his Pa&s;&s;ion, when the Object
of it is committed to his di&s;po&s;al; &s;o 'tis not to be
expected that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould ab&s;tain from com|mitting
all &s;orts of Outrages on the <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;a|crificing
both their E&s;tates and Lives to their own
Intere&s;t, &s;ince their Avarice irritates 'em with
greater violence (if po&s;&s;ible) than Lu&s;t does the
other in the former ca&s;e: &s;o that Laws back'd with
Menaces and Puni&s;hments will make no impre&s;&s;ions
on the minds of the&s;e men, but they'l be &s;ure &s;till to
exerci&s;e a thou&s;and Cruelties on the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> if
no other cour&s;e be taken to give check to their Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I entreat your Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider what befals any
Province to which you &s;end a Governor. If he be
covetous, and regardle&s;s both of his Honor or Reli|on,
what Di&s;orders and Mi&s;chiefs does he not bring
with him? Tho he has not &s;o ab&s;olute a Power as
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have over the <HI>Indians</HI> whom they keep
in their Hou&s;es; tho the Royal Council of <HI>Spain</HI>
think them&s;elves concern'd to oppo&s;e his Prevarica|tions;
and tho the King's Pre&s;ence one would think
&s;hould be a &s;trong Bridle to re&s;train his Exactions:
yet in two years time, &s;uch a Governor as we have
bin de&s;cribing will become rich, by the Rapine and
Extortion he commits in the Province put under his
care. What then is it likely the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will do,
in the remote&s;t parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> when they have
an unlimited Power over the <HI>Indians,</HI> and neither
&s;tand in awe of God nor the King; and when the&s;e
poor People are under &s;o great apprehen&s;ion of
&s;till more intolerable Cruelties, that they dare not
complain of the violence they &s;uffer? And how
&s;hall they report their Grievances? &s;hall they go to
the Royal Council, which is it may be three or four
<PB N="212" REF="116">
hundred Leagues from 'em; or &s;hall they addre&s;s
them&s;elves to your Royal Throne, which is di&s;tant
above three thou&s;and? What cour&s;e &s;hall they take
to prove the In&s;ults, Vexations and Per&s;ecutions
they endure from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in Countries &s;o re|mote,
where they can expect no relief?</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o hardn'd by their exce&s;&s;ive
Avarice, that they are not in the lea&s;t touch'd with
the Groans and Complaints of the&s;e mi&s;erable Peo|ple;
for nothing makes impre&s;&s;ion on their minds
but Gold and Silver. The Condition to which they
advance them&s;elves in the <HI>Indies</HI> is &s;o far above their
former &s;tate, that it in&s;pires 'em with intolerable
Pride and Arrogancy. They pa&s;s away their time
in plea&s;ure and fea&s;ting, and clothe them&s;elves after
&s;o &s;umptuous a manner, that nothing in the World
can be more magnificent. And withal it may well be
&s;aid that nothing can equal the corruption, licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s
and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of their Manners; and to
&s;upply all the&s;e &s;uperfluous Expences and Exce&s;&s;es,
they &s;uck out the very Blood of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
Now &s;eeing there's no hope of obliging the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
to alter their Conduct, and both the Laws of
God, and right Rea&s;on, and all the Maxims of Poli|cy
and Prudence oppo&s;e the giving of any Govern|ment
into the hands of covetous and indigent Per|&s;ons,
who are prejudic'd with a violent de&s;ire of
gain: Much le&s;s ought your Maje&s;ty to &s;uffer the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to u&s;urp a Title to the <HI>Indians</HI> as their
Free-hold, when they are &s;o greedy and in&s;atiable,
that they'l make no difficulty to &s;acrifice all kinds of
duty to the de&s;ire they have of raking &s;ums of Mo|ny
together any way in the World. For all their
Indu&s;try will be employ'd in pillaging their Va&s;&s;als;
and which is yet more to be lamented, while they
cruelly deprive 'em of temporal Life, they likewi&s;e
take a cour&s;e to expo&s;e 'em to eternal Death.
<PB N="213" REF="116">
Therefore your Maje&s;ty ought to incorporate the
<HI>Indies</HI> with the Inheritance of your Crown, that you
may be the univer&s;al Father, Protector, Governor
and Lord of all the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>I add to all the foregoing Rea&s;ons, that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
impo&s;e intolerable Burdens on the <HI>Indians,</HI>
and exact &s;uch Services of 'em as reduce 'em to the
extremity of mi&s;ery and de&s;pair. 'Tis their fir&s;t
and principal duty to &s;erve and obey their own na|tural
Princes; becau&s;e this is founded on the Law of
Nature. In the &s;econd place, they owe your Maje|&s;ty
&s;ervice and obedience, as being their univer&s;al
Soveraign; which is an obligation of Divine Right,
founded on the Engagement your Maje&s;ty has con|tracted
to &s;end 'em the Light of the Go&s;pel, and
to take care for their In&s;truction in the orthodox
Faith. The third kind of Service is that which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> oblige 'em to render them whether they
will or no, which is a &s;evere and tyrannical Yoke, nay
more intolerable than what the Heathen Tyrants im|pos'd
on the primitive Chri&s;tians; it may be liken'd
to the torment the Devils inflict on the Damned in
Hell. The Violence of it is contrary to all the Laws
of Nature and Rea&s;ons, nor can it be ju&s;tified by any
human Laws. It mu&s;t be remembred that the <HI>In|dians</HI>
are naturally weak, going always naked, and
continually expos'd to the heat of the Sun: 'tis there|fore
contrary to all Ju&s;tice that they &s;hould be op|pre&s;s'd
with heavy Burdens far above their &s;trength,
as well as contrary to Charity, and the Cu&s;tom of all
rea&s;onable Men. All the &s;ervice the&s;e poor Crea|tures
do can't &s;atisfy the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who therefore &s;et
an Officer over 'em &s;trictly to in&s;pect their Actions,
and render their &s;ervitude &s;till more terrible. This
Employ is u&s;ually be&s;tow'd on &s;ome cruel and inexo|rable
Mon&s;ter, who always &s;tands over 'em to make
'em work the harder, and punctually to obey all his
<PB N="214" REF="117">
Commands. The Executioners of the divine Wrath
in Hell can't be more wicked and hard-hearted than
this &s;ort of Men: They brand 'em with hot Irons,
and are continually beating and abu&s;ing 'em; they
are not content to make 'em labor without inter|mi&s;&s;ion,
and to &s;et 'em unrea&s;onable Tasks, but al|ways
reproach and chide 'em while they undergo
this Toil, and be&s;ides all this, violate their Wives
and Daughters, or make Pre&s;ents of many of 'em
together to their Ma&s;ters on whom they depend,
and who &s;et 'em to work as &s;o many principal Ty|rants,
who al&s;o make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to invent cruel
and un&s;ufferable Torments. And to hinder the
<HI>Indians</HI> from complaining of their Mi&s;eries, they
threaten to inform again&s;t 'em, that they have &s;een
'em wor&s;hip their Idols. This is the &s;ad &s;tate to
which the&s;e People are reduc'd. They depend on
no le&s;s than four &s;everal Ma&s;ters, on your Maje&s;ty,
their <HI>Caciques,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to whom they are in|&s;lav'd,
and his Deputy, who is the greate&s;t Plague
to 'em that can be. Nay, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to tell how
many Ma&s;ters they have, &s;eeing all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do|mineer
over 'em as &s;o many Tyrants, robbing 'em
by turns, and making no &s;cruple cruelly to abu&s;e and
murder 'em.</P>
<P>Seeing the preaching of the Orthodox Faith is
the only thing that could warrant the reduction of
the <HI>Indians</HI> to a &s;tate of dependance on any foreign
Power, in order to their Conver&s;ion; and &s;eeing
none can pretend on this account to be their lawful
Soveraign but your Maje&s;ty; it follows that your
Maje&s;ty ought with all your might to oppo&s;e the
Power which private Men a&s;&s;ume over 'em, and
which can't be look'd upon as any better than Ty|ranny.
Your Maje&s;ty is oblig'd for the common
good of all your Subjects to e&s;tabli&s;h a regular and
&s;table form of Government among 'em, which may
<PB N="215" REF="117">
conduce to their Conver&s;ion and Salvation: and &s;ee|ing
the &s;overaign and &s;ingle Power you have over
'em is &s;ufficient for the end propos'd, other Juri&s;|dictions
are not to be tolerated, becau&s;e they can
only prove burden&s;om and incommodious, and con|trary
to the common Maxims of Government re|ceiv'd
in the World, which will not allow a People
to be &s;ubject to &s;everal different Princes; much
le&s;s &s;hould the <HI>Indians</HI> be thus &s;ubjected, becau&s;e of
their Poverty, Meekne&s;s, Patience, Humility, and
the tenderne&s;s of their Con&s;titution, partly occa|&s;ion'd
by their going naked, their unwhol&s;om Food,
and the Labor they undergo to get their living.
After all this 'twould be &s;ufficiently tedious and un|ea&s;y
to 'em if no other Duties were exacted of 'em
than tho&s;e which your Maje&s;ty and their <HI>Caciques,</HI>
who are their immediat Princes, impo&s;e. How then
can they be able to endure tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Tasks,
tho&s;e heavy Blows, Vexations and Abu&s;es of which
we have &s;poken above? If your Maje&s;ty has a mind
to pre&s;erve the <HI>Indians</HI> from utter De&s;truction, the&s;e
new Burdens ought not to be impos'd on 'em, nor
&s;hould they be condemn'd to this &s;evere Slavery.
This would be to violate the Laws of Ju&s;tice and
Charity: For the Ma&s;ters of Policy and Prudence
u&s;ually &s;ay, that tho a Prince require extraordinary
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Subjects in &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing Exigencies
of the Commonwealth; yet where the&s;e Subjects are
under other &s;ubordinate and immediate Lords, to
whom they are oblig'd to pay the &s;ame Duties, this
cannot be done, becau&s;e this would be to over|charge
'em with endle&s;s Taxes: for 'tis contrary to
all Ju&s;tice to oppre&s;s 'em with a double Burden, and
all good Laws formally condemn it; for the Rules
of Equity forbid all Oppre&s;&s;ion and Injury. There|fore
&s;ince the <HI>Indians</HI> are already bound to &s;erve
their natural and immediate Princes, and to pay 'em
<PB N="216" REF="118">
all the homage and duty of Subjects, it would be un|ju&s;t
to &s;ubject 'em to &s;uch new Ma&s;ters as pretend to
a right of exacting new Services of 'em. The
Taxes that are impos'd on any E&s;tate &s;hould be pro|portionate
to the Revenue that may be expected
from it; and there ought not to be more Homage
and Service annex'd to it than is rea&s;onable for
the advantage of him that owns that E&s;tate. If in|animate
things have this privilege, how much more
ought it to be &s;o with Men, who de&s;erve to be
us'd a little better? Since therefore your Maje&s;ty's
Government alone is &s;ufficient for the welfare and
advantage of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to &s;et other Lords over
'em would be to act contrary to Ju&s;tice. For who
can deny it to be contrary to all the Laws of Equity,
to &s;ubject the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who mind no|thing
but to rai&s;e E&s;tates by making a Prey of 'em?
An 'tis as oppo&s;it to Charity to add new Burdens to
them that can &s;carce bear &s;uch as are already im|pos'd
upon 'em, and to increa&s;e the Calamities of
&s;uch as are &s;ufficiently be&s;et with Affliction, be&s;ides
the pains they take for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their Wives
and Children&punc; Charity teaches to do to others as
we would have them do to us, to &s;ecure 'em from
all the Evil we can, and to relieve 'em in their In|digence
when they addre&s;s them&s;elves to us, and
&s;hew us their Nece&s;&s;ities, becau&s;e we our &s;elves are
de&s;irous of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, when in di&s;tre&s;s.
The Laws of Chri&s;t are founded on &s;uch Maxims as
the&s;e: <HI>Do to others what you would have others do to
you;</HI> and, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf;</HI>
in which one word, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, the whole Law is
contain'd. He farther &s;ays, <HI>Bear ye one another's
Burdens, and &s;o fulfil the Law of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be con&s;ider'd, that all the Inhabitants of
the New World are born free: Nor do they lo&s;e
this Liberty in recognizing your Maje&s;ty for their
<PB N="217" REF="118">
Soveraign, and univer&s;al Emperor of the <HI>Indies.</HI>
On the contrary, if there be any defects in their
Polity, your Maje&s;ty's Government may &s;upply 'em,
by which their Liberty will be render'd the more
compleat. This was the de&s;ign of that mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian
Prince&s;s, Queen <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> as appears by all the
Writings &s;he left about this Affair. A few days be|fore
her Death &s;he commanded General <HI>d' Alcantara,</HI>
then Governor of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> to treat all the <HI>Indians</HI>
as a free People. And in a general A&s;&s;embly of
Divines and Lawyers held at <HI>Burgos,</HI> his Catholic
Maje&s;ty declar'd in Council, that the Inhabitants of
<HI>America</HI> were free, and commanded they &s;hould be
treated as &s;uch. The &s;ame was done by your Ma|je&s;ty,
after having con&s;ulted the mo&s;t learned Di|vines
and Canoni&s;ts in the year 1523.</P>
<P>Now if it be an inconte&s;table Principle that all
the <HI>Indians</HI> are free, and that all of 'em that have
been, or &s;hall be di&s;cover'd in time to come, can't be
&s;ubjected to any other Juri&s;diction but that of your
Maje&s;ty, and that they own to your Maje&s;ty alone
that Homage and Obedience which free Cities and
Nations are oblig'd to pay their lawful Soveraign,
'tis mo&s;t evident that no private Men can pretend
to the &s;ame. Nay, they are more free in re&s;pect
of us than other Nations, becau&s;e the Kings of
<HI>Spain</HI> have no Title to 'em as their Subjects by
right of Inheritance, or that of Purcha&s;e, or of
Conque&s;t, as they might have had, if they had
been conquer'd in a lawful War, that had bin for|mally
declar'd, for the revenge of &s;ome great
Offence which the <HI>Indians</HI> might have commited
again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or again&s;t the univer&s;al
Church, or &s;ome very con&s;iderable Member of it,
for which they had refus'd Satisfaction when de|manded:
or if they had unju&s;tly retain'd any Lands
or Goods of which they were unlawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.
<PB N="218" REF="119">
But on the contrary, they have frankly and volun|tarily
&s;ubmitted them&s;elves to your Maje&s;ty. And
yet they have bin hitherto not only neglected, but
treated by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as wild Bea&s;ts are by Hun|ters,
tho they never did any thing to de&s;erve &s;uch
ill u&s;age. They have yet &s;een nothing to convince
'em of your Maje&s;ty's Grandure, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s,
and Magnificence, having found nothing but Ty|ranny,
Violence, Inju&s;tice and Cruelty from the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> your Subjects, who&s;e ill Actions and bad
Examples render 'em infamous; &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI>
look upon 'em as the vile&s;t of Men. And this makes
'em think upon the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> with horror,
who yet never gave 'em occa&s;ion to entertain &s;uch
thoughts of 'em. But they fancy your Maje&s;ty per|fectly
knows all the ill treatment they endure, and
that 'tis by your Con&s;ent and Approbation; they
believe 'tis all done by your order, and that you
give your Protection and Favour to tho&s;e that in&s;ult
over 'em.</P>
<P>The Title your Maje&s;ty has to the <HI>Indians</HI> is
founded only on the Obligation you have taken
upon your &s;elf to have 'em in&s;tructed into the true
Faith, as appears by the Apo&s;tolic Briefs granted
on this account: which ought to engage your Ma|je&s;ty
to moderate your Government &s;o much the
more, and to treat 'em with the greater tenderne&s;s
and kindne&s;s. The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould &s;ignalize
the Fir&s;t-fruits of their Soveraignty over the <HI>Indies,</HI>
by the tokens of Peace and Love to the&s;e People,
and by taking care to furni&s;h 'em with good Ex|amples:
In a word, they ought to treat 'em as their
Neighbors and natural Subjects, for fear the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of any Inju&s;tice or Cruelty among 'em &s;hould
prejudice 'em again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Faith, and in|di&s;po&s;e
'em to receive the Coun&s;ils and Maxims of
our Religion. There &s;hould not be the lea&s;t occa|&s;ion
<PB N="219" REF="119">
given 'em on any account to bla&s;pheme the
Name of God, which would be an Ob&s;tacle to the
great end of their Conver&s;ion. Nothing &s;hould be
left undone, that may make 'em love your Maje&s;ty,
and induce 'em to prai&s;e God on finding them|&s;elves
under a Government &s;o ea&s;y and commodious.
They de&s;erve in &s;ome re&s;pect to be dealt with after
this manner, becau&s;e of the freedom of their birth,
which makes it unju&s;t for any to violate their Li|berty.
'Tis nece&s;&s;ary for the Honor of the Chri&s;|tian
Religion, that they embrace it voluntarily,
becau&s;e God him&s;elf will have men make a free
choice in matters of Religion; nor is any man
what&s;oever to be treated with violence in this ca&s;e,
and forc'd to embrace a Religion again&s;t his Will.
And temporal Princes commit a great piece of in|ju&s;tice,
if they put a force on the minds of their
Subjects in a bu&s;ine&s;s wherein they ought to have an
entire liberty of Con&s;cience: they &s;hould rather
ob&s;erve the Rules which God, the Univer&s;al Sove|raign
of all his Creatures, has con&s;tituted. There
is no Power or Authority on Earth that has a right
to violate the Liberty of any People, becau&s;e 'tis
the mo&s;t valuable thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and preferable
to all other things in the World. Hence it is there
are &s;uch advantageous Con&s;titutions in the Civil
Law in favor of Liberty. And the particular Cu&s;|toms
of the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> pre&s;cribe that no|thing
be determin'd in prejudice of a Man's Liberty
in doubtful things, nor the lea&s;t force or con&s;traint
put upon men that are free. And when their con|&s;ent
to any thing is violently extorted, it ought not
to be imputed to 'em, becau&s;e 'tis an infringement
of the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>If 'tis unlawful to &s;eize on the Goods of Men that
are free without cau&s;e, much more is it to offer
violence to their Per&s;ons, and to in&s;lave 'em, which
<PB N="220" REF="120">
is the greate&s;t Injury they can receive next to the
lo&s;s of Life it &s;elf. If a Father can't choo&s;e him&s;elf
another Heir without the con&s;ent of his Son, who
has a natural Title either to the whole, or at lea&s;t
a 4<HI>th</HI> part of his Father's E&s;tate; much le&s;s may
inferior Lords pretend to a right of appropriating
the Kings Subjects to them&s;elves, unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty
con&s;ent by abandoning his own Right, which is found|ed
on the voluntary Agreement of his Subjects. If
the current Mony of the Kingdom can't be alter'd
without the People's con&s;ent, becau&s;e the alterati|on
may be attended with great Inconveniences;
much le&s;s can the People them&s;elves be taken from
the Dominion of the King again&s;t their Will, and
&s;ubjected to the ab&s;olute Power of private Ma&s;ters;
becau&s;e this forc'd Change is a Violation of their Li|berty.
It mu&s;t be farther added, that &s;uch as are
tributary to your Maje&s;ty, can't pa&s;s under the Juri&s;|diction
of another Per&s;on, which would be more
unea&s;y and di&s;advantageous to 'em, and under which
they would perhaps be condemn'd to a more &s;ervile
and laborious Cour&s;e of life. How much more
ought they who enjoy an entire liberty under any
Prince's Government, to be pre&s;erv'd in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their Privileges; and how injurious would it be
to deliver 'em up as Va&s;&s;als to particular Lords,
who would probably abu&s;e their Authority, and
treat their Per&s;ons with violence, as well as greatly
prejudice 'em in their E&s;tates? 'Tis mo&s;t injurious
both to the Lives and Liberties of Men, to depend
on divers Lords and Ma&s;ters, becau&s;e their Service
and Labors multiply according to the number of
tho&s;e under who&s;e juri&s;diction they are: And 'tis to
be pre&s;um'd they will not be all alike ju&s;t and equita|ble.</P>
<P>'Tis very much the Intere&s;t of Princes, not to &s;uf|fer
the number of their Subjects to be dimini&s;h'd,
<PB N="221" REF="120">
becau&s;e it will deprive 'em of much of the advan|tage
and &s;ervice they may rea&s;onably expect from
'em. And 'tis as much the Intere&s;t of Subjects, not
to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be transfer'd from the Do|minion
of the Prince under which they have always
liv'd, to that of an inferior Ma&s;ter. Tho&s;e that
know the difference between the Government of
Kings, and that of particular Lords, which is u&s;ual|ly
hard and &s;evere, will do any thing to be &s;ecure
from the latter; while they are well pleas'd with
the former, and readily di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to bear
a Yoke that appears &s;o much ea&s;ier and lighter
than the other. And this is the rea&s;on why the ge|nerality
of Men do all they can to avoid falling un|der
the dominion of private Men to the prejudice
of that Royal Juri&s;diction to which they have been
continually accu&s;tom'd. And this Sentiment is ju&s;|tified
by the &s;uffrage of all wi&s;e Men, and favor'd
by all ju&s;t Laws.</P>
<P>'Tis a general Rule, that a Prince can do nothing
that may cau&s;e any con&s;iderable damage to his Sub|jects,
unle&s;s they freely give their own con&s;ent:
And this your Maje&s;ty every day ob&s;erves, where|in
you follow the &s;teps of your Ance&s;tors, who to
avoid doing any thing contrary to the rules of Ju&s;|tice
and Equity, frequently us'd to a&s;&s;emble their
Council, and to take their advice who were Per|&s;ons
of great Wi&s;dom and Sen&s;e, and to make a due
improvement of it. In the pre&s;ent affair, it would
be injurious to the <HI>Indians</HI> to give 'em up to the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
as their Va&s;&s;als, becau&s;e they u&s;e 'em &s;o bar|barou&s;ly,
and reduce 'em to the utmo&s;t degree of
Servitude. And &s;uch a matter as this is not to be
concluded, without propo&s;ing it to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and
obtaining their con&s;ent. For thus to change their
condition without con&s;ulting 'em, were to put a
treacherous trick upon 'em again&s;t the Laws of Na|ture,
<PB N="222" REF="121">
Ju&s;tice and Charity, becau&s;e this &s;ubjection
would be to a &s;evere and tyrannical Power; as is
evident by what the <HI>Indians</HI> have hitherto met with
from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Be&s;ide, &s;uch an alteration would
be contrary to the Will and Law of God, becau&s;e
it would hinder the progre&s;s of the Catholic Faith,
and in&s;pire the <HI>Indians</HI> with hatred to the Go&s;pel,
and would tend to the general de&s;truction of tho&s;e
People whom your Maje&s;ty is bound to pre&s;erve and
protect. This you owe 'em from a motive of Cha|rity
and Zeal for the good of your Neighbor, as you
are a Chri&s;tian Prince, and moreover by the Obli|gation
of your Office, as the Vice-gerent of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>From all the Rea&s;ons alledg'd, it may well be con|cluded,
that if even the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves would
voluntarily con&s;ent to be in&s;lav'd, and utterly re|nounce
their Liberty; yet this con&s;ent of theirs
would be void and null of it &s;elf, becau&s;e a thing
every way &s;o mi&s;chievous ought by no means to be
tolerated. Your Maje&s;ty would be oblig'd by the
Law of God to hinder 'em from ruining them&s;elves
in &s;uch a manner; becau&s;e the Tyranny the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
exerci&s;e over 'em is &s;o great, that many of
the <HI>Indians</HI> have fallen into utter de&s;pair under their
un&s;ufferable Impo&s;itions, and cho&s;en rather to &s;tab
or poi&s;on them&s;elves than to pine away gradually
under their mi&s;erable Bondage: Others have fled
into the Mountains, where they have become a Prey
to Tigers and Lions; others have died merely with
Sorrow and Angui&s;h, when they found they were
condemn'd to a Life &s;o full of Mi&s;ery and Toil,
without any hope of re&s;pit or mitigation. I knew
a <HI>Spaniards</HI> who was &s;o famous for his Cruelty, that
above two hundred People kill'd them&s;elves, &s;ome
one way and &s;ome another, to avoid his Barbarities
in <HI>Hi&s;paniola:</HI> A like number underwent the &s;ame
<PB N="223" REF="121">
fate in the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where this Tyrant exercis'd
his Violence and Rapine.</P>
<P>But tho the common Intere&s;t of all Nations in
the World ought to prevent their Kings from alie|nating
them from their own Dominion to make 'em
the Va&s;&s;als and Subjects of private Men, and tho this
is founded on natural Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice; yet &s;ome|times
in pre&s;&s;ing Exigencies Princes may alienate a
part of their Territories to extricate them&s;elves out
of &s;ome great and perplexing difficulty, from which
they cannot otherwi&s;e get free. For in&s;tance, if
they have no other cour&s;e to take for the defence of
the Commonwealth, it &s;eems lawful for 'em to ex|change
the Juri&s;diction they have over their Subjects,
provided they &s;ome way indemnify 'em, or repair
any damage this exchange may occa&s;ion. But 'twould
be impo&s;&s;ible to indemnify the <HI>Indians</HI> if they &s;hould
be left to the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who bring
upon 'em inexpre&s;&s;ible Calamities and Mi&s;chiefs, that
can never be repair'd by any advantage they may
allow 'em; for they take a cour&s;e to de&s;troy both
their Souls and Bodies. Therefore &s;eeing the Con|ver&s;ion
of the <HI>Indians</HI> depends principally on your
Maje&s;ty's Title and Juri&s;diction over 'em, you ought
not to do any thing that may bla&s;t the hope of this
De&s;ign, and will infallibly hinder the&s;e People from
embracing Chri&s;tianity. And it mu&s;t be remem|ber'd
they have freely and willingly cho&s;e your Ma|je&s;ty
for their Soveraign, which is a kind of Con|tract
they have made with your Maje&s;ty, that can|not
be violated without their Con&s;ent, unle&s;s it be
to put 'em in a condition more ea&s;y, advantageous
and &s;ecure, than what they enjoy under your Ma|je&s;ty's
Dominion. And your Maje&s;ty is oblig'd to
promi&s;e and &s;wear to 'em, that you will always
pre&s;erve their Privileges, as they are ordinarily kept
in the generality of Kingdoms, when a free People
<PB N="224" REF="122">
&s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Government of a new
King. This Practice is almo&s;t as antient as the
World, for ever &s;ince Men began to &s;pread them|&s;elves
upon the face of the Earth, it has always been
the cu&s;tom of Princes to promi&s;e and &s;wear to 'em to
employ all their Power in pre&s;erving and defending
'em from Oppre&s;&s;ion. Which evidently proves that
your Maje&s;ty has not power to give up the <HI>Indians</HI>
to the ab&s;olute Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
have had the cruelty to de&s;troy &s;uch numerous Na|tions
of 'em, without any legal Proce&s;s, or leave to
make their Defence. For it would be to act contra|ry
to the Law of God and Nature to expo&s;e 'em to
&s;o many Mi&s;eries, which are as &s;o many invincible
Ob&s;tructions to hinder 'em from turning Chri&s;tians.
Nor is there any Prince on Earth, who can ju&s;tly
pretend to have &s;uch a Power: for Soveraign
Princes have no Authority to do any thing that may
provoke the Ju&s;tice of God, who has not &s;et 'em
over their People for their ruin and de&s;truction, or
for the overthrow of the Church; but on the con|trary
has &s;et 'em in the World to defend the Church,
to bring their People to e&s;pou&s;e the true Faith, and
edify 'em in it.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and the Law of Nature direct that tho&s;e
who have made an ill u&s;e of the Privileges granted
to 'em, &s;hould be depriv'd of 'em. Now the Juri&s;|diction
allow'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over the <HI>Indians</HI> was
only on condition they would in&s;truct 'em in Reli|gion,
and defend 'em from their Enemies; and they
have not only fallen &s;hort of this Engagement, but
even barbarou&s;ly abus'd tho&s;e they were oblig'd to
protect. 'Tis remarkable in the Laws of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that if a Ma&s;ter treats any one of his Slaves inhu|manly,
he is oblig'd to &s;ell him, becau&s;e 'tis but ju&s;t
that he who tyrannizes over his Subjects &s;hould lo&s;e
his Juri&s;diction over 'em, which of right devolves
<PB N="225" REF="122">
on the Prince. He that abu&s;es his Title is not wor|thy
to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: and a Man neither owes Homage
nor Obedience to a Tyrant. So that your Maje&s;ty
ought in quality of Soveraign Lord of the People
of the New World, to defend 'em, and do 'em
Ju&s;tice, when they are wrong'd; and con&s;equently
to re&s;cue 'em from the power of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that
they may enjoy their Liberty.</P>
<P>'Tis moreover a Cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Laws
of <HI>Spain,</HI> That if the King grant any Privilege
contrary to the Catholic Faith, 'tis null and void, as
much as if it were contrary to the civil Good and
Welfare of the Kingdom, or to the Rights of any
particular Per&s;ons. And the &s;ame account is to be
made of any Privilege given contrary to the Law
of Nature: as for example, if a King &s;hould take
away any private Man's E&s;tate, to be&s;tow it on ano|ther.
Therefore your Maje&s;ty cannot dive&s;t the na|tural
Princes of the <HI>Indians</HI> of their Dominion over
'em, to inve&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with it, who not only are
Foreigners to 'em, but al&s;o treat 'em after a tyrannical
manner. 'Tis therefore nece&s;&s;ary for your Maje&s;ty
to revoke &s;o unju&s;t a Privilege, de&s;tructive to the
People, and directly oppo&s;it to the Catholic Faith,
as well as to your Maje&s;ty's Service, the advantage
of your Kingdom in general, the good of many
Members of the Commonwealth in particular, and
which is contrary to Rea&s;on, and the Law of Na|ture.</P>
<P>'Tis farther con&s;tituted by the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Spain,</HI>
in conformity to the Imperial Laws of your Ma|je&s;ty,
as well as tho&s;e of the Church, that when a
Privilege in proce&s;s of time proves injurious, and
occa&s;ions more hurt than good, it ought to be im|mediately
aboli&s;h'd, without &s;o much as con&s;ulting
the Prince that granted it; becau&s;e from that very
moment wherein this Privilege began to be detri|mental,
<PB N="226" REF="123">
it ought to be &s;uppos'd the Prince de&s;ign'd
to revoke it: &s;o that it can have no more force or
authority, becau&s;e not according to the Prince's In|tention,
who always ought to have Equity and the
Divine Will in view. Now &s;ince the Privilege
granted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;ubject the <HI>Indians</HI> as Va&s;&s;als
is become &s;o pernicious, and occa&s;ions an irrepa|rable
damage to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to the
Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and has bin the cau&s;e of the ruin
of &s;uch va&s;t numbers of People, and of the de&s;ola|tion
of &s;ome of the fine&s;t Countries in the World;
and &s;eeing in all appearance it is the very rea&s;on of
tho&s;e Calamities with which God is now afflicting
<HI>Spain,</HI> 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to apply a &s;peedy Remedy, and
to go to the root of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in revoking &s;o
pernicious and tyrannical a Grant.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over the
<HI>Indians</HI> has never bin judicially approv'd by the
Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> He that fir&s;t &s;har'd the&s;e poor
People among 'em, as if they had been &s;o many
Sheep, had no order to make this di&s;tribution,
which ab&s;olutely de&s;olated and unpeopled <HI>New Spain,</HI>
but exceeded the limits of his Power; &s;o that no ju&s;t
Con&s;equence can be drawn from what he did. It
was the great General <HI>d'Alcantara</HI> who began this
irregular cour&s;e in <HI>America.</HI> In the year 1502, the
mo&s;t &s;erene King <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and Queen <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;ent
General <HI>De-Lar&eacute;s</HI> from <HI>Grenada</HI> to govern the new
Conque&s;ts: At which time there were but three
hundred Chri&s;tians in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> This
Governor was expre&s;ly charg'd to treat the <HI>Indians</HI>
as free Nations; to be very kind, tender and chari|table
toward 'em, to do 'em exact Ju&s;tice on all
occa&s;ions, and not to impo&s;e too &s;evere a Yoke on
'em, or to in&s;lave 'em; in a word, to protect 'em
from all Injuries, le&s;t any Violence &s;hould prove a
Stumbling-block to divert 'em from entertaining
<PB N="227" REF="123">
the Chri&s;tian Faith, and in&s;pire 'em with an aver&s;ion
to the Profe&s;&s;ors of it. General <HI>De-Lar&eacute;s</HI> carried
with him three thou&s;and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who landed at
<HI>St. Domingo,</HI> where they &s;oon found them&s;elves re|duc'd
to great &s;traits for want of Food. However,
the &s;trict Orders he had receiv'd would not permit
him to do any Violence to the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to infringe
their Liberty in the lea&s;t; upon which he writes
many things to the Queen again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> hop|ing
to render 'em odious to her by his Lies and
Slanders, that he might have leave to abu&s;e the poor
Wretches at his plea&s;ure. Among other things he
wrote, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to preach the
Chri&s;tian Faith to 'em as long as they were &s;uffer'd
to enjoy an entire Freedom, becau&s;e they indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
avoided all manner of acquaintance with the
Chri&s;tians; in &s;o much that they refus'd to work
for 'em, tho they offer'd 'em Wages for their La|bor,
and cho&s;e rather to wander up and down as
Vagabonds, than to keep company with Chri&s;tians
to inform them&s;elves of their Religion. As if he
thought the <HI>Indians</HI> were oblig'd to divine that
there was a new Religion to be preach'd to 'em,
which they ought to embrace; or that they ought,
as poor as they are, to for&s;ake their Hou&s;es, Wives
and Children, and to leave their Lands unmanur'd,
to come to &s;eek the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;o expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to die with Hunger in a Journey it may be of
two hundred Leagues or more; or as if they were
under any obligation to undergo the fatigue of bring|ing
Provi&s;ion to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;uch a tedious way as
this.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, who was &s;incerely zealous for the
Salvation of the&s;e Idolaters, and publi&s;hing the
Name of Chri&s;t in the New World, an&s;wer'd the
General after this manner: <Q>We very ardently
de&s;ire the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians</HI> to our holy
<PB N="228" REF="124">
Faith, and that they be taught the My&s;teries of
the Catholic Religion; and think it nece&s;&s;ary to
the &s;ucce&s;s of this De&s;ign, that the <HI>Indians</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards</HI> conver&s;e and live together. Therefore
we by the&s;e Pre&s;ents command you to oblige the
<HI>Indians</HI> to deal with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI>
and to have Conver&s;ation with 'em, to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em
in building their Hou&s;es, and in getting Gold and
other Metals out of the Mines, and to pay 'em
their Wages exactly, according to their labor
and de&s;ert. You &s;hall likewi&s;e order every <HI>Ca|cique</HI>
to have a certain number of <HI>Indians</HI> always
in a readine&s;s to be employ'd in &s;uch Work as
&s;hall be a&s;&s;ign'd 'em, provided that care be taken
to preach to 'em, and in&s;truct 'em in the Word
of God on all Holy-days, and that they be always
treated as Free-men, and not as Slaves; and be|&s;ure
let them meet with no ill u&s;age, nor have any
occa&s;ion to complain: Yet let &s;ome di&s;tinction be
&s;till made in favor of &s;uch as embrace the Faith.
But let no Per&s;on be permitted to wrong 'em, or
give 'em the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t in any thing what&s;oever.</Q>
The&s;e are the very words of the Letter which the
King &s;ent to the Governor of the <HI>Indies,</HI> by which
his Maje&s;ty &s;ufficiently &s;ignified that his principal
de&s;ign in the <HI>Indies</HI> was the Salvation of tho&s;e Ido|laters,
and that for that end they &s;hould conver&s;e
with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which plainly proves he had no
other regard to this Commerce betwixt the Chri&s;ti|ans
and the&s;e Infidels, but only as a nece&s;&s;ary means
for their Conver&s;ion. And it mu&s;t be farther ob|&s;erv'd,
that when the King gives order to oblige
each <HI>Cacique</HI> to &s;end the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a certain number
of <HI>Indians</HI> to work for 'em, on condition of being
paid for their Labor, he did not intend that all the
Men in the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;hould be bound to perform &s;uch
Tasks, much le&s;s that the Women, Children, old
<PB N="229" REF="124">
Men, and Chiefs of each Nation, whom the <HI>Indians</HI>
look upon as their natural Princes, &s;hould be thus
treated. The King de&s;ign'd there &s;hould be due
con&s;ideration had of their Nece&s;&s;ities, that they
&s;hould have liberty to provide for their Wives and
Children, and go every night home to refre&s;h them|&s;elves
with their Families, and &s;leep in their own
Hou&s;es. And it may be farther remark'd in the
King's Patent, that he did not in the lea&s;t de&s;ign
the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be made to work every day and
without intermi&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing it provides they &s;hould
be paid daily after their Labor; his intention was
that they &s;hould be engag'd by fair means to do
what was requir'd of 'em, and not forc'd to it whe|ther
they would or no; in &s;hort, that they &s;hould
be us'd in all re&s;pects as a free People. Be&s;ides, the
King commanded that all their Labors &s;hould be
moderate, and proportionate to their Strength, and
that they &s;hould re&s;t on Holy-days and Sundays, that
their Wages &s;hould be &s;utable to their Work, &s;uffi|cient
to encourage 'em in taking pains, and to re|lieve
their Families in all their dome&s;tick Nece&s;&s;i|ties.</P>
<P>If the King had a perfect account of the nature
of the Land in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of the Weakne&s;s, Pover|ty,
Meekne&s;s and good humor of the Inhabitants,
of the rigor and &s;everity of their Labors, and the
great difficulty of getting Gold out of the Mines;
if he knew the de&s;olate &s;tate in which they are often
left, and the little care taken to engage 'em to re|ceive
the Sacraments before they die, he would
without doubt employ &s;ome effectual means to put
an end to the&s;e Di&s;orders. The fir&s;t Admiral of
the <HI>Indies,</HI> who made the di&s;covery of this New
World, though the acted conformably to the King's
Intere&s;t in rendering the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>New Spain</HI> tri|butary,
by obliging 'em to dig a certain quantity
<PB N="230" REF="125">
of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he carried with
him, &s;hook off the Obedience they ow'd the King,
and &s;et up for &s;o many Tyrants, committing Vio|lence
and Spoil beyond what can be ea&s;ily imagin'd
in the Province of <HI>Xavagua,</HI> one of the fine&s;t and
mo&s;t populous Countries in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The King
being inform'd of the&s;e Ravages, wrote his mind
to General <HI>De-Lar&eacute;s,</HI> and order'd him to put a &s;top
to the Cruelty and Violence of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and to govern 'em as a free People, which
Orders were not well executed: For the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;hut up the <HI>Indians</HI> by force in the Mines, to employ
'em in the toil&s;om work of digging for Gold, which
requires a very robu&s;t Con&s;titution: And when
they had got this Gold, they were forc'd to be all
day in the Water to wa&s;h it. At fir&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI>
were kept in the Mines for a whole year, till the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> found they were not able to endure &s;uch
hard and continual Labor, and therefore gave 'em
&s;ome time of re&s;pite, contenting them&s;elves to
keep 'em only for five Months in digging Gold, after
which they employ'd 'em forty days in melting it.
This they pretended was a time of re&s;t for the&s;e
poor Creatures, tho this latter &s;ort of Work is
more toil&s;om than that of grubbing up of Roots,
and clearing Ground that is over-run with Wood:
&s;o that they don't know what a Holy-day or Sun|day
means throughout the whole year. They are
&s;ometimes almo&s;t fami&s;h'd, having nothing given
'em &s;ave a few dry Roots that yield but little Nu|triment:
Tho the mo&s;t liberal of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> di&s;|tribute
a Porker once a week among half a hundred
<HI>Indians,</HI> which is little more than every one a ta&s;te.
Nay &s;ome of 'em have not been willing to give the
<HI>Indians</HI> that &s;erv'd 'em any thing at all to eat, but
<PB N="231" REF="125">
out of mere Avarice &s;ent 'em to feed like Bea&s;ts in
the fields, or to gather fruit upon the Mountains,
after which they forc'd 'em to work two or three
days together without eating. One Man frankly
confe&s;s'd to me that he had got a great E&s;tate in a
little time by this kind of frugality. What &s;trength
can Bodies that are naturally of a tender Con&s;titu|tion
be &s;uppos'd to have when fed after this manner,
and oppre&s;s'd be&s;ides with exce&s;&s;ive Labor? 'Tis
impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t long under this cruel
Bondage; which makes 'em lead a &s;orrowful, lan|gui&s;hing
and mi&s;erable Life, being de&s;titute both of
convenient Food and Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho the King order'd each <HI>Indian</HI> to be paid in
proportion to his Work, that they might have &s;ome|thing
to live on, and be capable of buying them|&s;elves
Nece&s;&s;aries; this Command has been ill ob|&s;erv'd,
for they had nothing at all for many years;
&s;o that they were put to the greate&s;t Extremity,
and &s;uffer'd Hunger to that degree that they de&s;ir'd
nothing more than to die, that they might find an
end of their Mi&s;eries. The&s;e are the Calamities
the poor <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;uffer'd in the Service of
Chri&s;tians, who have had no regard either to their
Souls or Bodies.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e Orders that have been given the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to treat the <HI>Indians</HI> as a free People, not
to over-charge 'em with Labor, not to do 'em any&punc;
Inju&s;tice, and to let 'em mind their own Affairs,
and order their bu&s;ine&s;s as they &s;aw good, they have
bin no more heeded than the other. For they have
been made mere Slaves, and certainly have not &s;o
much liberty as Bea&s;ts. And the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as good
Chri&s;tians as they are, are not at all mov'd by all
the Calamities the&s;e poor Wretches undergo, but look
upon them as the vile&s;t of Slaves, and not fit to have
the liberty of doing any thing they have a mind to
<PB N="232" REF="126">
do. They are con&s;tantly expos'd to the Cruelty of
the&s;e Tyrants, and not treated like human Crea|tures,
but wild Bea&s;ts, who are kept in Chains by
their Owners, and di&s;pos'd of at their plea&s;ure.
If they &s;ometimes let 'em go to their own Country,
they will not &s;uffer 'em to carry their Wives and
Children with 'em, nor hardly any thing to eat; &s;o
that they are pre&s;ently con&s;train'd to return, while
the Reflection they make on their deplorable Con|dition
often makes 'em de&s;ire death to relieve 'em.
If the exce&s;&s;ive Labors impos'd on 'em make 'em
&s;ick, as it often happens (becau&s;e, as I have ob|&s;erv'd,
the natural Temper of their Bodies is none
of the &s;tronge&s;t) the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do not in the lea&s;t
pity their Condition, but oppre&s;s 'em with intole|rable
Tasks, reproaching 'em as lazy, and only
feigning them&s;elves ill to be excus'd from Labor.
And when they &s;ee their Sickne&s;s increa&s;e, &s;o that
they become un&s;erviceable, they &s;end 'em to their
own Country, which is &s;ometimes forty or fifty
Leagues di&s;tance, giving 'em nothing but a few &s;ap|le&s;s
Roots to eat by the way, &s;o that they often die
mi&s;erably, not being able to accompli&s;h &s;uch a Jour|ney.
Sometimes we find &s;ome of 'em on the Road
ju&s;t ready to expire, others groaning hideou&s;ly in
the Agonies of Death, and others quite dead. Tho&s;e
of 'em that are able to &s;peak, &s;ay nothing but <HI>Hun|ger,
Hunger.</HI> Your Maje&s;ty by this account may &s;ee
that the Governor of the New World had little
regard to the Orders that were given him, to treat
the <HI>Indians</HI> as a free People.</P>
<P>That Governor was expre&s;ly charg'd not to do
any thing to the <HI>Indians</HI> that might hinder 'em from
receiving the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion,
or prejudice their Lives or Health, becau&s;e the King
had no de&s;ign to de&s;troy 'em: yet this Man &s;aw in|finit
numbers of 'em peri&s;h that were imploy'd in
<PB N="233" REF="126">
melting of Gold. The Labors exacted of 'em were
like a furious Pe&s;tilence, which cuts off multitudes
of People in a little time; and yet this &s;ad Spectacle
could not engage him to revoke his cruel Orders,
or &s;o much as mitigate the &s;everity of 'em. How|ever
he knew well enough that he was not able to
excu&s;e his Proceedings either before God or the
King, being expre&s;ly contrary to the Charge that
had been given him; and therefore us'd &s;o much
Subtilty and Artifice in the management of this
Affair, that none of his Cruelties on the <HI>Indians</HI>
were known in <HI>Spain</HI> for tho&s;e &s;even years in which
he tyranniz'd over the New World. They that
came after him, trod in his &s;teps by de&s;troying the
<HI>Indians,</HI> tho his Catholic Maje&s;ty recommended it
to 'em to induce the <HI>Indians</HI> to receive the Catholic
Faith, by &s;hewing all kindne&s;s to 'em, and not to
make War upon 'em on the account of Religion, or
to con&s;train 'em to embrace Chri&s;tianity by force,
but rather to treat 'em as the King's Liege People,
impo&s;ing a certain Tribute on 'em, as on his other
Subjects. All this was expre&s;s'd in the In&s;tructions
given to <HI>Pedrarias,</HI> when he was made Governor of
the <HI>Indies;</HI> notwith&s;tanding which he enter'd <HI>Ame|rica</HI>
ju&s;t as a hungry Wolf falls on a flock of Sheep,
and made horrible &s;laughters on all &s;ides, u&s;ing &s;uch
unheard of Torments, and making &s;uch wa&s;te and
&s;poil, that nothing like it is to be found in any
Hi&s;tory. He might have been look'd upon as a
heavy Plague, &s;ent by God to execute his Wrath in
extirpating the <HI>Indians.</HI> This Man, and tho&s;e that
accompanied him, cheated your Maje&s;ty of five or
&s;ix Millions of Gold, and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to compute
the Spoil they made in the <HI>Indies.</HI> They depopulated
a Country of above four hundred Leagues, as rich,
fertil and plea&s;ant as any in the World. All this
Tyranny was us'd to make the <HI>Indians</HI> deliver up
<PB N="234" REF="127">
all their Gold: But by the ju&s;t Judgment of God
they made no great advantage of their Robberies;
and it would have bin more for their intere&s;t to
have kept the <HI>Indians</HI> alive, and to have made a con|&s;iderable
Profit out of their hard Labors. If a par|ticular
account &s;hould be given your Maje&s;ty of all
the Di&s;orders committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the
noble Province of <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> your Maje&s;ty would
be a&s;toni&s;h'd; and if they had not &s;till continued
their Tyranny over the&s;e poor People, every day
killing and de&s;troying 'em, I &s;hould not have ex|pos'd
my &s;elf to the fatigue of &s;o tedious and trou|ble&s;om
a Voyage, to give your Maje&s;ty an account
of it. When your Maje&s;ty is a&s;&s;ur'd that the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
have depopulated &s;o many va&s;t and noble King|doms,
and that they &s;till continue to de&s;troy what|ever
e&s;cap'd the fury of former Governors; when
you are convinc'd that they have carried Fire and
Sword through &s;even Kingdoms that are larger than
<HI>Spain,</HI> your Maje&s;ty will ea&s;ily be per&s;waded that
what I have &s;aid is no Exaggeration. I have &s;een
the&s;e Kingdoms in a manner as full of People as
Hives are of Bees, where now there are none to be
found, having been all murder'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
&s;o that there are only naked Walls and empty
Hou&s;es to be &s;een in many once populous Cities.
The Orders given by the mo&s;t Catholic Queen <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>
to General <HI>De-Lar&eacute;s</HI> were very prudent and
u&s;eful, but he did not think fit to ob&s;erve 'em; and
the Relation he gave the King and Queen of matters
from time to time, were very far from Truth, tho
&s;upported by the Te&s;timony of divers <HI>Indians.</HI> He
acted quite contrary to the In&s;tructions given him,
violating all the Rules of the Law of Nature and
Rea&s;on; by which 'tis evident he went beyond his
Commi&s;&s;ion, and prevaricated in tho&s;e Letters he
directed to the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI> by intermixing
<PB N="235" REF="127">
Fal&s;hoods in his account, and di&s;gui&s;ing what was
true. And 'tis certain if your Maje&s;ty had been
inform'd how tyrannically this Governor treated
the <HI>Indians,</HI> you would never have entru&s;ted your
Authority in his hands; and by con&s;equence your
Maje&s;ty is oblig'd to declare that you dete&s;t the Pro|ceedings
of this Governor as inju&s;t and tyrannical,
and to abrogate all he has done, and declare that
the <HI>Indians</HI> ought not to have been &s;ubjected to the
Dominion of particular Men, and that all the In|juries
they have &s;uffer'd are contrary to the Law of
God and Nature, as well as to the Imperial and
Canon Laws; &s;eeing they have been tormented in
their Per&s;ons, mole&s;ted in their Liberty and E&s;tates,
and condemn'd to die. Your Maje&s;ty is oblig'd, as
you are a ju&s;t Prince, and an Enemy to Violence, to
&s;uppre&s;s the&s;e vexatious Practices, and to deliver the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> from the Tyranny of tho&s;e that have
oppre&s;s'd and tormented 'em.</P>
<P>If your Maje&s;ty neglect to take this cruel Yoke
from their Necks, they will infallibly peri&s;h. And
that lovely Country which is naturally fruitful and
populous will &s;oon become a va&s;t De&s;ert; for the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that go thither, don't go to people the
Country, but to inrich them&s;elves by pillaging it.
Tho&s;e that have lately gon into <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and
other depopulated places, and carried thither the
Commodities of <HI>Europe,</HI> have not been able to di&s;|po&s;e
of 'em, there not being People to buy 'em: So
that the&s;e Di&s;orders are directly oppo&s;ite to your
Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t; for what advantage can you re|ceive
from the ruin of tho&s;e People? And what will
the World &s;ay of &s;o ju&s;t a Prince as your Maje&s;ty,
if when you are inform'd of the mi&s;chief don by
your Subjects in tho&s;e va&s;t Kingdoms, and among

of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he carried with
him, &s;hook off the Obedience they ow'd the King,
and &s;et up for &s;o many Tyrants, committing Vio|lence
and Spoil beyond what can be ea&s;ily imagin'd
in the Province of <HI>Xavagua,</HI> one of the fine&s;t and
mo&s;t populous Countries in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The King
being inform'd of the&s;e Ravages, wrote his mind
to General <HI>De-Lar&eacute;s,</HI> and order'd him to put a &s;top
to the Cruelty and Violence of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and to govern 'em as a free People, which
Orders were not well executed: For the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;hut up the <HI>Indians</HI> by force in the Mines, to employ
'em in the toil&s;om work of digging for Gold, which
requires a very robu&s;t Con&s;titution: And when
they had got this Gold, they were forc'd to be all
day in the Water to wa&s;h it. At fir&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI>
were kept in the Mines for a whole year, till the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> found they were not able to endure &s;uch
hard and continual Labor, and therefore gave 'em
&s;ome time of re&s;pite, contenting them&s;elves to
keep 'em only for five Months in digging Gold, after
which they employ'd 'em forty days in melting it.
This they pretended was a time of re&s;t for the&s;e
poor Creatures, tho this latter &s;ort of Work is
more toil&s;om than that of grubbing up of Roots,
and clearing Ground that is over-run with Wood:
&s;o that they don't know what a Holy-day or Sun|day
means throughout the whole year. They are
&s;ometimes almo&s;t fami&s;h'd, having nothing given
'em &s;ave a few dry Roots that yield but little Nu|triment:
Tho the mo&s;t liberal of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> di&s;|tribute
a Porker once a week among half a hundred
<HI>Indians,</HI> which is little more than every one a ta&s;te.
Nay &s;ome of 'em have not been willing to give the
<HI>Indians</HI> that &s;erv'd 'em any thing at all to eat, but
<PB N="231" REF="128">
out of mere Avarice &s;ent 'em to feed like Bea&s;ts in
the fields, or to gather fruit upon the Mountains,
after which they forc'd 'em to work two or three
days together without eating. One Man frankly
confe&s;s'd to me that he had got a great E&s;tate in a
little time by this kind of frugality. What &s;trength
can Bodies that are naturally of a tender Con&s;titu|tion
be &s;uppos'd to have when fed after this manner,
and oppre&s;s'd be&s;ides with exce&s;&s;ive Labor? 'Tis
impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t long under this cruel
Bondage; which makes 'em lead a &s;orrowful, lan|gui&s;hing
and mi&s;erable Life, being de&s;titute both of
convenient Food and Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho the King order'd each <HI>Indian</HI> to be paid in
proportion to his Work, that they might have &s;ome|thing
to live on, and be capable of buying them|&s;elves
Nece&s;&s;aries; this Command has been ill ob|&s;erv'd,
for they had nothing at all for many years;
&s;o that they were put to the greate&s;t Extremity,
and &s;uffer'd Hunger to that degree that they de&s;ir'd
nothing more than to die, that they might find an
end of their Mi&s;eries. The&s;e are the Calamities
the poor <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;uffer'd in the Service of
Chri&s;tians, who have had no regard either to their
Souls or Bodies.</P>

tho&s;e Trea&s;ures &s;ufficient to enrich all <HI>Spain,</HI> would
be no &s;mall advantage to promote your De&s;igns, and
enable you to re&s;i&s;t your Enemies. If there come
no Mony from the <HI>Indies,</HI> but that Spring of Trea|&s;ure
be &s;uffer'd to dry up, <HI>Spain</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
&s;u&s;tain great Inconveniences for want of it. Ex|perience
already &s;hews that the <HI>Indies</HI> don't furni&s;h
us with &s;o great a quantity as in time pa&s;t, and 'tis
likely to dimini&s;h more and more for time to come.
Be&s;ides, the manner of extorting it from the <HI>Indians</HI>
can't po&s;&s;ibly la&s;t long, becau&s;e 'tis too violent a
cour&s;e. The I&s;le of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> is an unexceptionable
<PB N="237" REF="131">
In&s;tance of what I &s;ay; for whereas above three
Millions of very fine Gold were drawn out of it at
fir&s;t, it cannot now afford the tenth part of that
Sum. The lea&s;t Reflection your Maje&s;ty can make
will ea&s;ily convince you how your Revenues every
day dimini&s;h. Your Maje&s;ty has nothing certain and
&s;table in the <HI>Indies,</HI> if the Land be not cultivated,
and the Inhabitants pre&s;erv'd for tho&s;e Labors that
are &s;o advantageous. You have now but a &s;mall
number of <HI>Indians</HI> in all <HI>New Spain,</HI> from whence
your Maje&s;ty might annually have drawn a Million
of Ducats, if the <HI>Indians</HI> had been pre&s;erv'd, and
your Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t at fir&s;t regarded. There
have been yet greater Confu&s;ions and Di&s;orders in
<HI>Peru,</HI> and the Mi&s;chief daily increa&s;es; from which
Kingdom your Maje&s;ty might yearly receive two or
three Millions of Gold if the <HI>Indians</HI> were not
treated with &s;o much Inju&s;tice and Inhumanity, ma|ny
of 'em having been murder'd, togther with their
great King <HI>Atabalipa.</HI> All the Gold the Chri&s;tians
have taken by force in <HI>Peru</HI> would of right have
belong'd to your Maje&s;ty, becau&s;e that <HI>Indian</HI> Prince
would have voluntarily pre&s;ented him&s;elf to your
Maje&s;ty with all his Trea&s;ures. The Church has
likewi&s;e receiv'd great damage by the&s;e Cruelties;
for as your Maje&s;ty has been fru&s;trated of tho&s;e
immen&s;e Riches, &s;o the Church has lo&s;t an infinit
number of Souls who have peri&s;h'd in their Igno|rance,
when they might have been taught the My&s;te|ries
of our Faith: &s;o that the Lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tain'd both
by Church and State are irreparable.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> which your Maje&s;ty rules
with &s;o much Equity, is &s;urrounded with Enemies,
and in danger of being wa&s;ted and ruin'd by the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> tho&s;e declar'd Enemies of the
Catholic Faith: Becau&s;e God, who is the ju&s;t Judg
and Soveraign Lord of the Univer&s;e, is grievou&s;ly
<PB N="238" REF="132">
offended with the Violence and Ma&s;&s;acres which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have committed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they
have oppre&s;t and &s;laughter'd innumerable multi|tudes
of People. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> have rational Souls
form'd after the image and likene&s;s of God, and
ran&s;om'd by the Blood of his Son, who keeps an
account of 'em, and will not think 'em of no value,
how ignorant and barbarous &s;oever they &s;eem to
be. He was pleas'd to choo&s;e <HI>Spain</HI> to the Service
of carrying the Light of the Go&s;pel into the New
World, and to engage tho&s;e Nations to entertain
the Chri&s;tian Faith. And it &s;eem'd as if the Al|mighty
had di&s;cover'd all the&s;e Temporal Riches to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as a recompen&s;e for tho&s;e Spiritual
Plea&s;ures with which they were to enrich the <HI>Indies.</HI>
But tho he open'd a way for 'em into tho&s;e va&s;t
Regions, &s;o wealthy, fertil and plea&s;ant, &s;o full of
Mines of Gold, Silver and precious Stones; in&s;tead
of being thankful for all the&s;e Favors, they have
committed the mo&s;t hainous Crimes to provoke him.
Now 'tis u&s;ual for God to di&s;tribute his Puni&s;hments
by a rule of proportion, adju&s;ting them to the na|ture
of the Offence. If Men &s;in by Pride, he covers
'em with Confu&s;ion and Shame; if they get any
thing unju&s;tly through Avarice, he often &s;uffers 'em
to lo&s;e their own Goods; and they that have &s;tolen,
are in turn rob'd them&s;elves. Tho&s;e that oppre&s;s
and murder others, he permits to fall into the hands
of &s;uch as treat 'em with the like Cruelty: They
that take away their Neighbors Wives and violate
'em, have &s;ometimes the &s;ame Outrages committed
on their own. And &s;uch as u&s;urp Kingdoms that
don't belong to 'em, by God's Judgment come to
&s;ee their own Kingdoms invaded by their Enemies;
and thus it is with other Judgments which frequently
an&s;wer the different kinds of Sin. The Holy Scrip|ture
and other Hi&s;tories are full of In&s;tances to this
<PB N="239" REF="132">
purpo&s;e; and Experience every day furni&s;hes us
with &s;uch marks of the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure as the&s;e.
The <HI>Moors</HI> once over-run <HI>Spain,</HI> and this was in|terpreted
as a Judgment from God to puni&s;h the
Crime of King <HI>Roderick,</HI> who ravi&s;h'd the Daughter
of Count <HI>Don Julian,</HI> tho 'tis more probable it was
to puni&s;h the Crimes of the People of <HI>Spain,</HI> and
the Injuries they offer'd their Neighbours, and that
the Crime of this King only fill'd up the mea&s;ure of
tho&s;e Vices.</P>
<P>'Tis convenient to inform your Maje&s;ty what is
thought by Per&s;ons of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, who are go|vern'd

Sufferings of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> I have heard many

the&s;e Riches from the <HI>Indies</HI> have made a mi&s;erable

Poverty, which ju&s;tifies the old Maxim, <HI>Vix gaudet

&s;urely come to want,</HI> Prov. 22. 16. Becau&s;e, as has
bin &s;aid, the Divine Judgments bear &s;ome propor|tion
to the Crimes that Men commit. If your Ma|je&s;ty
have the curio&s;ity to inform your &s;elf of the
detail of all the&s;e matters, we can &s;hew you a Li&s;t
of the principal Tyrants that have committed the
greate&s;t Di&s;orders in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by pillaging and
<PB N="240" REF="133">
ma&s;&s;acring tho&s;e poor People, and have them&s;elves
all died in a dreadful and de&s;pairing manner. It
&s;eems their Violence and Cruelty, the great quan|tity
of Blood &s;hed in the Ma&s;&s;acres they have com|mited,
and their other vicious Actions, the effects
of which are yet to be &s;een, cry aloud to Heaven
for Vengeance; while the Tears, and Sighs, and
Entreaties of &s;o many poor Innocents have filled
Heaven and Earth, and put all the World into a
Con&s;ternation, to the utter &s;hame and reproach of
all the Spani&s;h Nation, and of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
too. Since then it depends only on your Maje&s;ty to
lay the Ax to the Root of all the&s;e Di&s;orders, and to
do Ju&s;tice to the&s;e afflicted People, it will be an
Argument of your Prudence and Equity to employ
your Power to deliver the <HI>Indians</HI> from the terrible
Oppre&s;&s;ions and Calamities under which they yet
groan.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may be pleas'd farther to ob&s;erve,
that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have an Authority given 'em
over the <HI>Indians,</HI> however it may be qualified, they
will infallibly abu&s;e it; for being naturally proud,
they'l become &s;till le&s;s obedient to your Maje&s;ty's
Commands: Nay the immen&s;e Sums which they'l
get in the <HI>Indies</HI> will enable 'em to confederate
with other Nations, to withdraw their Allegiance
entirely from your Maje&s;ty at long-run, and to &s;up|port
one another in their Rebellion. We already
&s;ee that the riche&s;t of 'em, that flatter them&s;elves
with the Title of Conquerors, are &s;o intolerably
pre&s;umptuous, as to &s;et them&s;elves above the Rules
of common Ju&s;tice. Your Maje&s;ty's Vice-roy &s;aid
not long &s;ince in one of his Letters, that the <HI>Indians</HI>
ought to acknowlege no other God nor King than
him&s;elf. Your Maje&s;ty therefore &s;hould take it for
granted that it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Security of
your Government, that there &s;hould be any great

Lord in the Continent of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> inve&s;ted
with an ab&s;olute Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Indians;</HI> this
Power ought to be in&s;eparable from your Royal
Per&s;on: 'Tis not convenient for the future to give
any one the Title of Count, Marque&s;s, or Duke over
either the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> that are &s;etled there;
becau&s;e 'twill prompt 'em to think too highly of
them&s;elves, and to advance them&s;elves above their
Condition, which may have very mi&s;chievous Con|&s;equences:
In a word, this may probably open 'em
a way to make them&s;elves Kings of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
thereby deve&s;t your Maje&s;ty of the Right you have

<P>Nor will it be more &s;afe to tru&s;t this Power in

attended with Inconveniences; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
for the Affairs of <HI>America</HI> to be well admini&s;tred if
the Members of that Council be ab&s;olute Lords of
the <HI>Indians:</HI> To be &s;ure then the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
&s;hall never know the truth of what pa&s;&s;es there;
this would produce nothing but Fraud and Im|po&s;ture,
and be an infallible means to compleat the
Ruin of the <HI>Indies.</HI> They that govern in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavour to prevent the Court of
<HI>Spain</HI> from receiving any true Information how
matters &s;tand there, that they may &s;ecurely pillage
the Country, and live at their own Di&s;cretion.
They have oppos'd tho&s;e Friers who&s;e Zeal carried
'em to <HI>America</HI> to preach, and have hinder'd 'em from
reaping the fruit they might have expected from
their Labors. The Judges and other Officers were
afraid the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians</HI> would be pre|judicial
to their Temporal Intere&s;t; and Avarice
bore &s;way in their Minds in&s;tead of that Zeal they
ought to have had for the Salvation of tho&s;e Infi|dels.
God is witne&s;s that this is true, and 'tis not
<PB N="242" REF="134">
difficult to prove it. They continued to per&s;ecute
the Monks, till one of 'em, pitying them i&s;erable
ca&s;e of the&s;e Idolaters, came on purpo&s;e to inform
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> of the Violence of his Officers,
and of the Ob&s;tructions they rais'd again&s;t the pub|lication
of the Go&s;pel there. Cardinal <HI>Ximenes</HI> at
that time manag'd the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> who being
well inform'd of the Affairs in the <HI>Indies,</HI> imme|diately
re&s;olv'd to deve&s;t the Council there of the
Juri&s;diction they pretended to have over the <HI>Indians,</HI>
as being very pernicious. But the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
are at &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance from tho&s;e Countries, that
they have not been able &s;peedily to redre&s;s all the
pre&s;&s;ing Grievances that ince&s;&s;antly afflict tho&s;e mi|&s;erable
People. Their Laws and Orders given at
&s;o great a di&s;tance have no great Efficacy: and 'tis
next to impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to have a true account
what Per&s;ecutions the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;uffer: Or if a true
Information &s;hould be had, they can only give &s;ome
general Orders, without de&s;cending to make &s;pe|cial
provi&s;ion again&s;t all tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs that can't
be well known unle&s;s they were upon the place
where they are acted. Be&s;ides, the Per&s;ons to whom
the&s;e Orders are directed, commonly conceal 'em,
or defer the execution of 'em; &s;o that when they go
about to fulfil 'em, 'tis too late, and the Remedies
applied prove un&s;ea&s;onable and u&s;ele&s;s. Nay, they
are often &s;o wicked as to act in direct contradiction
to what is commanded 'em; and flatter them&s;elves
with hopes of never being call'd to account, becau&s;e
they are &s;o remote from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>If your Maje&s;ty would re&s;erve to your &s;elf alone
the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Indies,</HI> without &s;haring it
among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it would be the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s
imaginable to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and nothing could
more rejoice 'em, becau&s;e then they would be con|vinc'd
they &s;hould be no more expos'd to the In|&s;ults
<PB N="243" REF="134">
and Per&s;ecutions of their Enemies; and would
have &s;o great a re&s;pect for your Maje&s;ty, obey you
&s;o univer&s;ally, and love you &s;o &s;incerely, that they
would be always ready to &s;acrifice their Lives for
your Service. You could then require nothing of
'em, but they would do it chearfully, becau&s;e they
&s;eem to have a great propen&s;ion to &s;ubmit to
your Royal Crown; whereas if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
their ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters, as their Obedience will
be forc'd, &s;o it will be of no long continuance,
and they'l do all they can to get free of &s;o &s;evere
a Yoke.</P>
<P>Moreover, when the <HI>Indians</HI> are once per&s;waded
they are under your Protection, that they may live
&s;afely in their own Hou&s;es, and need fear no injury
either in their Per&s;ons or Goods; all that are re|tir'd
to the Mountains will &s;oon come down to dwell
in the Plains, as they were wont heretofore. For
abundance of 'em have retreated to avoid the Cru|elties
of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and chu&s;e rather to be de|vour'd
by wild Bea&s;ts in the Mountains, than to fall
into the hands of their Per&s;ecutors, tho Chri&s;tians.
The poor Wretches &s;uffer a world of Inconveniences
in tho&s;e places whither they have retir'd, wanting
almo&s;t all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life: And 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble
to find 'em out to in&s;truct 'em in the Chri&s;tian
Faith: whereas if they liv'd together in Towns and
Cities, they might ea&s;ily be taught Religion, and a
regular &s;ort of Government e&s;tabli&s;h'd among 'em,
whereby they would be brought to the Service of
the True God, which would become familiar to 'em:
By this means the Ground would be cultivated, the
Roads frequented and render'd more &s;afe, and the
Country no longer be de&s;ert and forlorn: The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would be &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions, and
convenient places to lodg in on their Journeys, and
have a thou&s;and other Advantages of which they
<PB N="244" REF="135">
are now depriv'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;erting their Ha|bitations.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may remember that after a mature
examination of this Affair by many learned Men
and able Divines, they unanimou&s;ly declar'd, that
the Dominion of the <HI>Indies</HI> could not be ju&s;tly given
to private Men, nor di&s;member'd from your Ma|je&s;ty's
Crown. This Determination was &s;ignified
to <HI>Ferdinando Cortez,</HI> with orders to put it in execu|tion.
Your Maje&s;ty was pleas'd on the &s;ame account
again to call together an A&s;&s;embly of Per&s;ons of
great Learning and Virtue, who after a long de|bate,
declar'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not lawfully
be made Lords of the <HI>Indies.</HI> After which your
Maje&s;ty gave mo&s;t expre&s;s Orders to prohibit it,
revoking all Grants to the contrary procur'd on
tho&s;e fal&s;e Accounts and Mi&s;repre&s;entations that
had been given you. Your Maje&s;ty commanded the
Governor of <HI>Florida</HI> to put the&s;e Edicts in execution,
as may be &s;till &s;een by his In&s;tructions. Among the
principal Articles of the&s;e Con&s;titutions, one is,
That the <HI>Indians</HI> ought to be accounted free, and
not obliged to any other Services than the re&s;t of
your Maje&s;ty's Subjects who enjoy their Liberty
under your Government: That they ought to
pay Tithes to God, unle&s;s excus'd for &s;ome time,
and likewi&s;e &s;uch Tribute to your Maje&s;ty as is im|pos'd
lawfully, and in proportion to the Goods
they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the quality of their Land, accord|ing
to the rea&s;onable E&s;timate of tho&s;e that govern
'em.</P>
<P>If it be de&s;ir'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be taught
the Catholic Faith, and brought to embrace our
Cu&s;toms, while they keep up a &s;ort of Government
among them&s;elves, your Maje&s;ty ought not to give
them as Slaves to any one what&s;oever, either for
ever, or for a limited time; for this would be to ex|po&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="135">
'em to the &s;ame Mi&s;eries they have hitherto
endur'd, and perhaps to increa&s;e them: for after
this there will be no dependence to be had on the
Orders and Prohibitions made in favour of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> whatever Penalties &s;hall be annex'd to fa|cilitate
their Execution; for tho&s;e that have bin
already made are very wi&s;e Edicts, and might be
very u&s;eful if put in practice. And one chief
Rea&s;on again&s;t giving the <HI>Indians</HI> for Va&s;&s;als to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is the &s;mall account the&s;e latter
make of the Lives of tho&s;e poor Creatures; for
'tis not to be imagin'd with what Contempt they
look upon 'em, unle&s;s by tho&s;e that have &s;een it:
Their exce&s;&s;ive Covetou&s;ne&s;s induces 'em to make
'em labor beyond their Strength, not caring what
becomes of 'em &s;o they get any thing by 'em.
If any Per&s;ons give your Maje&s;ty a contrary ac|count
of the&s;e matters, you ought to look upon 'em
as Enemies to the State, and di&s;affected to your Ma|je&s;ty's
Service.</P>
<P>If your Maje&s;ty be convinc'd by the Arguments
produc'd, you will prevent the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from com|mitting
a great many Violences and Murders, of
which they are every day guilty. You will &s;ecure
<HI>Spain</HI> from this Contagion, in preventing your
People at home from partaking of the Sins of
their fellow-Subjects, and &s;haring the Plunder with
them which they have &s;o unju&s;tly gotten. For all
Men of &s;en&s;e acknowledg that the Crimes of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> render all <HI>Spain</HI> obnoxious to
the Cur&s;e of God; that the cour&s;e they take to be|come
rich is unju&s;t; that the Gold and Silver they
bring from the <HI>Indies</HI> is &s;tolen, and that they are
oblig'd to re&s;tore it to the right Owners whom
they have unju&s;tly plunder'd: which likewi&s;e evi|dences
that tho&s;e that partake of the&s;e u&s;urp'd
Riches have no good Title to 'em; for they ought
<PB N="246" REF="136">
to have no Commerce with tho&s;e publick Robbers,
nor to &s;ell 'em any Commodities for their &s;tolen
Gold; they &s;hould not &s;o much as receive Pre&s;ents
from 'em, or con&s;ent to be their Heirs: And if &s;o,
it follows that all <HI>Spain</HI> is become guilty of the
Crimes of tho&s;e Men; &s;o that there are few but
have rea&s;on to be under trouble of Con&s;cience, and
are in danger of Damnation, becau&s;e there are &s;carce
any who have not participated of the Rapine of
tho&s;e that have come from the New World.</P>
<P>It has bin objected by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that if they
have not a Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Indians</HI> as their
Va&s;&s;als, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to live in the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
and con&s;equently that your Maje&s;ty will not be
able to keep tho&s;e Kingdoms that have bin conquer'd
in your Name, nor to publi&s;h the Catholic Faith
there. For they &s;ay, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t
there, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> can't pre&s;erve his Domi|nion
over the <HI>Indians,</HI> nor maintain Monks among
'em to preach to 'em, &s;o that they mu&s;t be de&s;titute
of the Light of the Go&s;pel; and tho&s;e of 'em that
have already receiv'd it, will gradually lo&s;e it for
want of fre&s;h In&s;truction, and &s;o return to their for|mer
Idolatry, and other Sins.</P>
<P>They that rea&s;on after this manner, do it not &s;o
much from a Principle of true Zeal and Compa&s;&s;ion,
le&s;t &s;o many Souls &s;hould peri&s;h, as from a de&s;ire of
oppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e People, and that they may grow
rich by the Spoil they get from 'em. 'Tis only their
privat Intere&s;t makes 'em talk at this rate; for they
are not at all concern'd about your Maje&s;ty's Inte|re&s;t,
or the Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Tis not
the Good of the Public, or the Glory of God that
moves 'em; for their Conduct &s;ufficiently &s;hews what
little re&s;pect they have to the Law of God, which
forbids 'em to do the lea&s;t hurt to any one, how
great an advantage &s;oever it might procure 'em.

They ought to know, if they have the true Senti|ments

extended &s;o far as the <HI>Indies;</HI> and 'tis an ill way of
going to work, to endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h Chri&s;tianity
there by &s;uch criminal Methods. The rea&s;on of
which is evident, becau&s;e we are forbidden <HI>to do evil
that good may come,</HI> Rom. 3. 8. God is not pleas'd
with the greate&s;t Sacrifices if polluted with any Sin,
but abhors all &s;uch Offerings. 'Tis a mo&s;t hainous
Sin, and worthy of eternal Damnation, to ma&s;&s;acre
Infidels on pretence of introducing the Chri&s;tian
Faith among 'em, and of extirpating a part of 'em
to &s;ave the re&s;t. God dos not require Men to re|ceive
his Word on &s;uch hard terms, and ab&s;olutely
forbids &s;uch a kind of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls
as this. He would not have us pretend to be more
concern'd about the Salvation of Souls than him&s;elf.
That which he requires of us is to keep within the
compa&s;s of his Laws, and not to exceed the Limits
he has pre&s;crib'd. For 'twould be an Argument of
much Stupidity, and a great &s;in for any one to throw
a Child into a Well to baptize it, and &s;o to drown
it on pretence of &s;aving its Soul. And is it not a
greater Crime, and more odious and abominable in
the &s;ight of God, to &s;candalize, de&s;troy and ma&s;&s;a|cre
&s;o many thou&s;and People, under the pretext of
putting the re&s;t in the way of Salvation? 'Tis our
bu&s;ine&s;s to do all the Good we can in conforming our
&s;elves to God's Commandments, and keeping with|in
the bounds he has &s;et us, leaving the re&s;t to him|&s;elf.

rather to ruin and in&s;lave 'em, than to make Chri&s;|tians

<HEAD>THE
ART
OF
Travelling to Advantage.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS commonly thought that the Advantages
of Travelling are always out-balanc'd by
the Inconveniences that attend it; that
tho a Man is at never &s;o much Charge in
his Voyages, he mu&s;t &s;till undergo a great deal of
Hard&s;hip; and when all is done, the Profit he reaps is
not to be compar'd with the Fatigues he endures.
But nothing can be more fal&s;e than this Opinion; for
in truth, the advantage of Travelling infinitely &s;ur|mounts
the trouble of it: and as the Experiment of
a Chymi&s;t, whatever it co&s;ts him, is very well re|warded
when he makes &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;covery
of Nature; &s;o that Traveller that knows how to
improve his Mind as he ought by his Voyages, is al|ways
well requited for the Inconveniences he has
&s;u&s;tain'd.</P>
<P>The Prejudice that &s;ome entertain, that the want
of that Experience which is to be gain'd in Voyages
and actual Di&s;coveries, may be &s;upplied by reading
Books that treat of &s;uch matters, or by the force of
the Imagination, which gives its own &s;hape to all
things it repre&s;ents, and never makes 'em appear as
they are in them&s;elves, is a mere Illu&s;ion: For what|ever
<PB N="2" REF="138">
ever fore&s;tals and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Judgment is &s;o
little capable of forming the Mind, that 'tis the ve|ry
thing which corrupts it, and deprives it of its
natural reli&s;h for Truth, and that di&s;po&s;ition to re|ceive
it, which &s;erves as a foundation for Rea&s;on to
build upon. That which is found in Books is not
always true; for be&s;ides that Decency will not per|mit
Men to write but within the compa&s;s of certain
Rules, Flattery, the humor of the Time and Nation
wherein a Man lives, the public Intere&s;t, or the ma|nagement
of private Affairs, always make &s;ome dif|ference
between what a Man writes, and what may
be thought by tho&s;e among whom he lives: Which
forms an almo&s;t invincible Ob&s;tacle in the way of
Truth, and hinders her from &s;hewing her &s;elf in her
proper &s;hape.</P>
<P>But in Travelling we find all imaginable help and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to furni&s;h our Minds with Experience and
Knowledg; for what is conceal'd in Books is by
this means openly di&s;cover'd to us; and we judg of
things with more &s;afety, becau&s;e we &s;ee 'em with
greater per&s;picuity when the Curtain is drawn a&s;ide.
When we go to the very Principles of things, and
draw Water at the Fountain, the ta&s;te and quality
of it mu&s;t needs be mo&s;t agreeable. This is the way
to know Men as they really are, and not only as the
Intere&s;t of &s;ome Per&s;ons makes 'em appear to be;
and to judg of their Actions, Manners, and Poli|ticks
in them&s;elves, and not on the Credit of fo|reign
Relations; &s;o that the Mind receiving thence
a pure and vivid light, that &s;ets it above the dan|ger
of Prejudice, is at the &s;ame time confirm'd and
improv'd on &s;olid grounds, and at length rais'd to
the upper Region of Policy where its great Pheno|mena
appear.</P>
<P>We are taught in the Book of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes,</HI> that to
become wi&s;e a Man mu&s;t go into &s;trange Countries,
<PB N="3" REF="138">
<HI>Sapiens in terram alienigenarum Gentium pertran&s;iet;</HI>
and it follows afterwards, <HI>in ab&s;conditis &s;uis concilia|bitur,</HI>
by that means he &s;hall be acquainted with the
mo&s;t profound Notions of Wi&s;dom, that is, of
RELIGION; <HI>Occulta Proverbiorum exquiret,</HI> he'll
make a &s;crutiny into their Maxims, Manners and
Cu&s;toms, that is, into MORALITY: <HI>bona enim
&amp; mala in hominibus tentabit;</HI> he'll have the advan|tage
by conver&s;ing with the Living (which is much
better than to con&s;ult the Dead) to know the &s;ources
of that Good and Evil which Men do either to
them&s;elves, or one another, that is, in one word,
POLICY. The&s;e are the three fundamental Prin|ciples
by which a wi&s;e Man ought to regulate his
Conduct, and in the&s;e he ought to accompli&s;h him&s;elf
by Travelling: For a Man is confirm'd in his <HI>Reli|gion</HI>
by the knowledg he acquires of the importance
and certainty of it; he forms a &s;olid Scheme of
<HI>Morality</HI> from the different Practices he ob&s;erves in
the World, and informs him&s;elf in the true Rules
of <HI>Policy</HI> by the u&s;e he finds other People make
of 'em. From which it follows, that if a Man
would be wi&s;e, he ought to travel; and 'tis hard|ly
to be expected that any one who neglects this
method, will prove eminent for Prudence and Po|liticks.</P>
<P>This Art of Travelling to advantage requires
four Conditions that are all ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in
every one that would &s;ucceed in it. The fir&s;t is,
That his Mind be already form'd and fix'd, and yet
this in &s;uch a manner as not to be &s;trictly determin'd.
The &s;econd is, That he be not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Pre|judices.
The third is, That his Capacity bear a
proportion to the Science or Bu&s;ine&s;s to which he is
devoted, and in which he de&s;ires to be accompli&s;h'd.
And the fourth is, That he want no a&s;&s;i&s;tance
nece&s;&s;ary to bring him into acquaintance with the
<PB N="4" REF="139">
be&s;t Ma&s;ters, and that he know their Sentiments at
the fir&s;t hand.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, the fir&s;t Condition is to have the Mind form'd,
but not determin'd; that is, it &s;hould not be &s;o
crude as eagerly to receive all &s;orts of Impre&s;&s;ions,
and yet &s;ufficiently di&s;pos'd to give a free admi&s;&s;ion
to Truth, which will perhaps be under&s;tood better
by an Example. One that travels too young is im|mediately
di&s;&s;atisfied in the exerci&s; of the Religion
he profe&s;&s;es, by the different manners of Wor&s;hip
he di&s;covers abroad; therefore the greenne&s;s of his
Age makes him run a greater risk than is commonly
thought in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of matters of Religion,
tho it renders him very fit to endure Fatigues, the
difference of Climats, of Food, and of the various
Sea&s;ons of the Year. Nor is a Man any more fit to
improve by Travelling when too much advanc'd in
Years, becau&s;e his Mind is too much determin'd,
and in no very good di&s;po&s;ition to learn what he
thinks he knows well enough already. So that that
part of a Man's Age from twenty five to thirty five
is the mo&s;t proper time for Travelling, becau&s;e his
Mind is neither wholly crude, nor entirely form'd;
that which he has already learn'd only di&s;po&s;es him
to judg the better, while he &s;eeks to be inform'd
after another manner; and thus he makes &s;o fair a
deci&s;ion of what he learns, that all the Sophi&s;ms in
the World will never &s;hake him. By this 'tis ea&s;y
to &s;ee whence it is that &s;o few are the better for
Travelling, and can only give an account of &s;uch
Circum&s;tances as Soldiers and Po&s;tilions might ea|&s;ily
relate; 'tis to be attributed either to their too
great Youth or too great Age.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Qualification of a Traveller is, That
he be void of Prejudice in every thing, about which
he de&s;ires to receive Information; becau&s;e Prejudice
produces &s;uch an Effect upon our Rea&s;on, as a Film
<PB N="5" REF="139">
does upon the Eye; it ca&s;ts &s;uch a Mi&s;t upon it, and
renders it &s;o uncapable to make a fair Judgment of
what is propos'd to it, that nothing can be more
oppo&s;ite to the di&s;covery of Truth than Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on,
which if it bear &s;way in the Mind, will give little
hope of improvement by Travelling.</P>
<P>The third Quality requi&s;ite is, To have a Capacity
of Mind proportionate to the bu&s;ine&s;s to which a man
applies him&s;elf, and in which he &s;eeks to be accom|pli&s;h'd:
For &s;eeing the Rudiments of Painting and
other Arts are not to be learn'd by Travelling, and
ob&s;erving the fine&s;t Strokes of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters;
but a Man mu&s;t be cut out for a bu&s;ine&s;s before he
pre&s;umes to &s;eek Improvement in it by going abroad:
They that &s;uppo&s;e to turn a Blockhead into a Man of
Parts by &s;ending him into foreign Countries, will
find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. He that has but a &s;mall
Natural Capacity will never have a large one, what|ever
cour&s;e be taken to improve it: 'Tis true, he may
learn by Travelling to fill up what Capacity he has,
but he'll never be able to go beyond it; for the
Minds of Men have their &s;everal degrees of height
and &s;trength, as well as their Bodies; and as 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible by all the Art in the World to add one
inch to a Man's Stature when at his full growth, &s;o
'tis utterly impracticable to enlarge the Capacity
of his Mind beyond the Bounds which Nature has
pre&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The fourth Qualification is, To be furni&s;h'd with
all nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance to facilitate his Acce&s;s to the
Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Arts and Sciences he has a mind to
learn; in which re&s;pect every Country has a diffe|rent
Genius; &s;o that 'tis often &s;een, that what may
contribute to a man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in one place, will by
no means do him any good in another. For in|&s;tance,
In <HI>Germany</HI> a man &s;hall never get inward
with Great Men by being profu&s;e in his Expences,
<PB N="6" REF="140">
but will by this means be the more likely to fall un|der
&s;u&s;picion, and become much le&s;s welcome than
one of another Character. To gain E&s;teem there,
a Man mu&s;t bring with him a good Reputation, a
di&s;tigui&s;h'd Birth, or an extraordinary Merit. In
<HI>Italy</HI> the quite contrary Humor obtains. And in the
<HI>Levant</HI> neither one nor t'other takes place, but an
Air of Simplicity, Sincerity and Hone&s;ty will in|troduce
a Man into any Company. An eloquent
and voluble Tongue does well in <HI>Poland,</HI> but very
ill in <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;till wor&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> A great
&s;hew of Devotion will naturalize a Man in <HI>Portugal,</HI>
but render him ridiculous in the Northern King|doms.
A plea&s;ant and merry Humor will &s;poil a
Man's bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but give him ea&s;y
acce&s;s in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As for the knowledg of Tongues, be&s;ides that it
is impo&s;&s;ible to acquire all a Man wants if he travel
any thing far, and that it will not do him all the
Service that is commonly imagin'd, if he has only a
mind to run through <HI>Europe,</HI> it is a great occa&s;ion of
the Corruption of Manners, by ea&s;ily introducing
Men into places of Debauchery; and on the other
hand it has been ob&s;erv'd, that it contributes very
little to the forming of the Mind: for be&s;ides that
it is not the common People that a Man ought to be
curious in con&s;ulting; and among Men of figure the
knowledg of their Language renders a Man ob|noxious
to &s;u&s;picion, 'tis &s;ufficient that a Man can
&s;peak any one Language that is know: As the
Italian Tongue is very common in <HI>Greece</HI> and the
Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> be&s;ides the help one may have from
Interpreters, of whom there are great numbers for
all the living Tongues in <HI>Europe.</HI> And if you &s;peak
a dead Language with any Native of a foreign
Country, he has no advantage above you; and if
you are better vers'd in it than he, he'll be &s;ure to
<PB N="7" REF="140">
&s;upply what he wants in Expre&s;&s;ion by the degree
of Knowledg, wherein he excels you in re&s;pect of
the matter about which you conver&s;e, and will give
you a greater in&s;ight into it in half an hour's Di&s;|cour&s;e,
than you &s;hould have obtain'd it may be in
twenty Vi&s;its, if you had made u&s;e of his Native
Language. 'Tis &s;ufficient if you have Language
enough to make your &s;elf under&s;tood about your
nece&s;&s;ary Affairs; and there are always People to
be found, who will make u&s;e of your Native Lan|guage,
to di&s;cour&s;e with you &s;o as not to be under|&s;tood
by others, that they may learn &s;omething of
you that others don't know; and that they may
give you occa&s;ion to learn &s;omething of them which
you don't yet under&s;tand. But Curio&s;ity ought to be
kept within the bounds of Patience and Di&s;cretion,
and that being &s;uppos'd, there's &s;carce any thing
but a Man may be capable of it in Travelling; if
one can but add to the Conditions I have been men|tioning
a lively and yet ob&s;equious Fancy, and ea&s;y
and faithful Memory, a &s;weet and in&s;inuating Hu|mor,
a Curio&s;ity that is not impatient, and an im|partial
way of judging. The&s;e are the Qualities that
give a Man an ea&s;y and agreeable reception into all
Companies, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the People of any Na|tion
with favourable thoughts of a Traveller who is
endow'd with 'em. The&s;e cut his Work &s;hort, re|move
all Ob&s;tacles in the way of his acquaintance
with them, and bring them into &s;uch a familiarity
with him, as will be &s;ure to engage their Confidence,
if he be but careful to ob&s;erve him&s;elf, as well as
&s;tudy the Temper of others. The&s;e are the Vehi|cles
of Policy, which by di&s;covering the Humor,
Inclinations and Genius of every Nation, in&s;en&s;ibly
bring us to the knowledg of their Maxims, their
Rea&s;ons of State, their De&s;igns, their Conduct and
various Sentiments. In a word, 'tis by the help of
<PB N="8" REF="141">
the&s;e Qualifications, that a Man becomes a <HI>Proteus</HI>
in foreign Countries, and knows how to transform
him&s;elf into the &s;hape of others, and &s;o to conceal
his own. And by con&s;equence mu&s;t needs reap ad|vantage
by all the good he &s;ees or hears, which is
agreeable to his Character, and the Capacity of his
Mind.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, he &s;hould have a lively, but ob&s;equious Ima|gination,
which may pa&s;s for a Paradox among &s;uch
as judg ha&s;tily, ju&s;t as they feel their Fancies touch'd;
and &s;uppo&s;ing a lively Imagination can never be ob|&s;equious
without lo&s;ing its Vivacity at the &s;ame time,
will tell me I require an impo&s;&s;ibility: 'tis there|fore
convenient to undeceive 'em by a &s;en&s;ible Com|pari&s;on.
When one that &s;eeks for Game &s;ees &s;ome|thing
move in a Bu&s;h, his fir&s;t motion is to put him|&s;elf
in a po&s;ture to &s;hoot; but if he di&s;charges im|mediately
without any further Ob&s;ervation, he may
well be counted ra&s;h, and his precipitancy will &s;poil
his De&s;ign: whereas if he has prudence and patience,
he'll ob&s;erve what 'tis that &s;tirs, and endeavour to
di&s;cover what Game may be in the Bu&s;h, which way
it came, and whither it goes, which gives him the
greater advantage to direct his Aim, &s;o that his &s;hot
can hardly mi&s;s. There's no Compari&s;on can be
more ju&s;t and applicable to the ca&s;e in hand. A
Traveller that has a mind to make &s;ome Di&s;coveries
in the My&s;teries of State-Policy, is prying and ob|&s;erving
with an Activity like that of one who is
&s;eeking after Game; every thing that appears more
than ordinary ought to &s;trike his Mind &s;o as to ex|cite
his Attention: but nothing ought to determine
him but his Rea&s;on, and a due application of the
Principles of Policy; he &s;hould &s;ee and hear, and
take a mea&s;ure of every thing, without imagining
he has got any thing till he has mea&s;ur'd it with
that profound Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion I have been commending.
<PB N="9" REF="141">
State&s;men are extremely crafty, and know how to
dodg with a Stranger, e&s;pecially when they &s;ee in
him a great Vivacity and Eagerne&s;s to receive what
they tell him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Artifices are us'd in all Nations more or
le&s;s according to the degree of their Refinement and
Subtilty: Therefore the intelligent Traveller mu&s;t
imitate the cunning Hunter, who &s;ometimes makes
as if he did not &s;ee his Game, merely to &s;urprize
it the more ea&s;ily: He mu&s;t make as if he did not
hear &s;ome things, and as if he under&s;tood much le&s;s,
and di&s;cover'd nothing at all; from whence one of
the&s;e two things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, either that
he will be &s;uppos'd to be ignorant and &s;tupid, which
will render him le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, and occa&s;ion a new
Explication of the matter di&s;cour&s;ed of in more
open and intelligible terms; or el&s;e that the Per|&s;on
he conver&s;es with, will immediately give ano|ther
turn to the Subject in hand by different Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
and the variety of Terms cannot choo&s;e
but give &s;ome light into what he would conceal or
di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>He may al&s;o learn &s;omewhat from the common
report of a Province or City, to inform him what is
the predominant Genius of a Nation, or of the Court
that governs it, only with this difference, that what
he is told of the Spirit of any Nation, is generally
and almo&s;t infallibly true; whereas the Idea that is
given of a Court is almo&s;t always fal&s;e; &s;o that
'twould be a kind of Miracle if ever it &s;hould
happen to be true. There is in the Voice of the
Publick a certain tract of Truth, Simplicity, In|genuity
and Sincerity, which keeps the Multitude
either from being ea&s;ily deceiv'd them&s;elves, or
from deceiving others; and &s;o much the more, be|cau&s;e
(as <HI>Origen</HI> &s;ays) God, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all
things, has re&s;erv'd only this way to make an im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="142">
of Truth on the Minds of the Populace, who
are not capable of any other di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of things,
much le&s;s of refin'd Politicks; which gave occa&s;ion
to that wi&s;e &s;aying, <HI>The Voice of the People is the
Voice of God.</HI> But the Court is another World,
where all things are compounded, and from whence
Simplicity, Candor, Sincerity, and oftentimes even
Ju&s;tice and Truth are exil'd. And &s;eeing the Men
of this World are different from others, 'tis not to
be wonder'd at if one is deceiv'd by their Di&s;gui&s;es,
and if the warm Fancy of a young Man is every
day impos'd on by them: For every thing they do
is with de&s;ign, and therefore 'tis no wonder that
there's double dealing in all Affairs, &s;o that one
knows not where to have 'em. Hence it is that
tho&s;e Authors that write Relations of the State of
Princes-Courts, are carried away with &s;o many
Illu&s;ions: For the more account they make of that
certain knowledg they pretend to have of 'em, and
the more the Mini&s;try &s;ee they depend upon it, the
more they vary in their di&s;cour&s;e with &s;uch an Au|thor,
to deprive him of the &s;ight of what he aims
at, by embara&s;&s;ing his Mind with diver&s;ity of Me|diums.</P>
<P>There's no Rock more dangerous to an intelligent
Traveller, than the popular Reports which a Prince's
Council either purpo&s;ely &s;preads abroad, or &s;uffers
to be divulg'd: There's no &s;tre&s;s to be laid on &s;uch
Stories, and a Man ought to be careful not to &s;uffer
him&s;elf to be &s;urpriz'd by 'em. A wi&s;e Roman on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion one day &s;aid to me, <HI>Se que&s;to fo&s;&s;e
v&eacute;ro, non to &s;apr&eacute;bbe il popolo.</HI> <Q>The Credit the Peo|ple
give this Report may be enough to convince
you that there's no &s;uch matter at the Palace, but
that the bu&s;ine&s;s is either already fini&s;h'd, or el&s;e
'tis a &s;troke that is not re&s;olv'd, and it may be
not thought on, for if it was either the one or the
<PB N="11" REF="142">
other, you may be &s;ure the People would have
known nothing of it.</Q></P>
<P>However 'tis true, that common Reports as they
precaution the Fancy in&s;tead of in&s;tructing it, do
not fail to furni&s;h a Traveller with &s;uch Notices, as
mu&s;t needs turn to his account. The&s;e Reports
<HI>Salu&s;t</HI> very wi&s;ely calls, <HI>Experimenta Nationum, The
Trials of the People;</HI> for there is at lea&s;t &s;o much
probability in 'em, that they have &s;ome Principle
that gives ri&s;e to 'em, and that they have given
&s;ome colour to an End which a Court is willing to
hide by &s;ome &s;pecious means.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the <HI>Italians</HI> excel all Chri&s;tian Nations
in this method of Travelling; but the People of
the Ea&s;t infinitely out-do the <HI>Italians</HI> them&s;elves:
and 'tis from the long Conver&s;ation I have had with
both, that I have receiv'd what Light I have in this
matter, e&s;pecially the way of abating the heat of
Fancy, and preventing it from being tran&s;ported
beyond due bounds by its Vivacity, in which the
Ea&s;tern People are inimitable; and 'tis a Quality
one can't behold in 'em without A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing a Fancy that is tractable and obedient
determines nothing, and what it di&s;covers may as
well deceive it as inform it; it ought to commit the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all to the Judgment that &s;o it may come
to a re&s;ult: For this purpo&s;e the Judgment ought to
be &s;ublime and clear, tho the&s;e two Qualities are
not &s;o compatible as at the fir&s;t glance they &s;eem to
be: for the elevation of the Mind expo&s;es it to
Mi&s;ts and Clouds, tho clearne&s;s of thought is com|mon
to an exten&s;ive Soul. The former is like the
tops of Mountains which reach to the Clouds, and
almo&s;t always &s;eem cover'd with a Mi&s;t to them
that &s;tand in the Plain. That is, to explain the
Similitude; That Genius which is naturally &s;ub|lime,
being le&s;s capable than others of &s;tooping
<PB N="12" REF="143">
down to the many frivolous Circum&s;tances which
concur to the di&s;covery of the politick Spirit of a
Court, often happens to pa&s;s &s;uch a Judgment as is
not free from all Objections, or el&s;e his way of ex|pre&s;&s;ion
is le&s;s clear and intelligible than that of
others. On the contrary, they that affect clearne&s;s
of Judgment creep on the ground as it were, &s;till
following the natural extent of their Minds which
&s;erves for a Line to direct their &s;teps; and as with|out
this they could never go directly to the end they
have in view, &s;o by the help of it they do every
thing with a becoming Ju&s;tne&s;s and Deliberation.</P>
<P>Happy are they who&s;e Genius is both &s;ublime and
exten&s;ive, for the elevation of their Minds &s;hews
'em what Souls of an inferior Rank could never
have di&s;cover'd; and their exten&s;ion &s;erves to help
to render every thing pre&s;ent to 'em without con|fu&s;ion,
becau&s;e the elevation of their Minds gives
'em a pro&s;pect of every thing; &s;o that they &s;ee both
di&s;tinctly, and as it were at one view, whatever
is nece&s;&s;ary to direct 'em to make a right Judg|ment.</P>
<P>To inculcate this matter the better, it may not
be ami&s;s to make u&s;e of a Compari&s;on. Suppo&s;e
three Men walking in the field together di&s;cover an
Object at a di&s;tance: one of 'em having ob&s;erv'd
it, &s;ays 'tis a Cart going on the top of a Hill; ano|ther
&s;uppo&s;es it to be a Bu&s;h wav'd up and down by
the Wind; and the third is confident 'tis a Man on
hor&s;eback riding again&s;t the Wind. Now it being
naturally impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ame Object to be at
once a Cart, a Bu&s;h, and a Man on hor&s;eback, 'tis
mo&s;t certain that at lea&s;t two of the three are
mi&s;taken in their Judgments; and if one of them
judges right, it mu&s;t be he that con&s;iders with the
greate&s;t force of thought all po&s;&s;ible Motions of that
Object about which he has thought fit to make a
<PB N="13" REF="143">
Judgment. This di&s;covery is not to be a&s;crib'd
preci&s;ely to the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, &s;ince this is &s;uppos'd
to be alike in all three; therefore the truth of this
Judgment mu&s;t be attributed to the quality of his
Mind who has the be&s;t notices of the matter.</P>
<P>The application of this Compari&s;on is ea&s;y: Tra|vellers
often think they have di&s;cover'd every thing
that pa&s;&s;es in a Court, tho&s;e Enterprizes that are yet
only to be &s;een at a di&s;tance, and tho&s;e De&s;igns that
are &s;till more remote; yet 'tis not po&s;&s;ible that all
that make the&s;e Ob&s;ervations &s;hould have the &s;ame
elevation of Mind, and none but &s;uch as have a very
&s;ublime and clear Judgment are capable of &s;peaking
accuratly of what they have ob&s;erv'd. Hence it is
that we &s;ee &s;o many different accounts of foreign
Countries, and yet all of 'em publi&s;h'd for truth by
their re&s;pective Authors; and indeed they may be
&s;o, but this in proportion to the Character of the
Minds of tho&s;e who compos'd 'em in their Travels,
according to the Judgment they made of things.</P>
<P>If I had not read in the account of the Voyage to
<HI>Athens</HI> the Hi&s;tory of one <HI>Hieros Damaskinos</HI> of <HI>Ca|loyero,</HI>
with whom I had ju&s;t &s;uch another interview
as the Author of that Relation &s;ays happen'd to
him, I would here give an account of it at large;
but &s;hall now only add &s;omething which that Tra|veller
&s;eems not to have met withal. There were
three Gentlemen of different Countries and my &s;elf
one day di&s;cour&s;ing with this illu&s;trious <HI>Caloyer</HI> about
the Policy of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which each of us pretended
to look upon as barbarous and uncultivated, on pur|po&s;e
to give him an occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it after &s;uch
a manner as might give us light into it. He told
us he had no skill in Policy either in general, or in
the u&s;e of it among the <HI>Turks;</HI> and that he made it
his bu&s;ine&s;s only to under&s;tand and explain the holy
Scripture to his Di&s;ciples of <HI>Athens:</HI> but he &s;aid if
<PB N="14" REF="144">
we would addre&s;s our &s;elves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as to the
<HI>Vaivode</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> or any other Per&s;on of Note,
they would be &s;ure to give us &s;atisfaction in tho&s;e
matters.</P>
<P>I remember I was the only Per&s;on in the company
that could not be per&s;waded that this <HI>Caloyer</HI> was
unacquainted with Politicks. A very ingenious <HI>Po|lander</HI>
thought he was too much devoted to the &s;tudy
of the Scripture to have any great matter of skill
in other things. A <HI>German</HI> that was of our com|pany
took him for a Per&s;on only vers'd in the No|tions
of the School-men, and capable of criticizing
on the holy Scripture: an <HI>Italian</HI> that was with us
maintain'd that as he was one of that remnant of
Greeks who &s;eem to be the Po&s;terity of the Pea&s;ants
of former times; he had not &s;ubtilty of mind
enough to penetrate into &s;uch Politicks as were as
burden&s;om to 'em as they appear'd violent and un|rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>We pu&s;h'd our Curio&s;ity yet further, and by good
luck a <HI>Sangiac</HI> who was upon his return from <HI>Candie</HI>
to the Port, and pa&s;s'd through <HI>Athens,</HI> was &s;o kind
as to inform us of many things we had a mind to
know; and among other things told us there was no
Man in the World knew more of tho&s;e matters
than this Grecian. It may ea&s;ily be imagin'd I hug'd
my &s;elf for judging differently of this Man from the
re&s;t of the company. And at la&s;t, after many earne&s;t
Sollicitations, we engag'd this learned <HI>Caloyer</HI> to take
off the Mask, and &s;hew us that he was under &s;uch a
&s;erious di&s;gui&s;e of Simplicity as would have deceiv'd
a thou&s;and People.</P>
<P>To return from this Digre&s;&s;ion; I &s;ay, to judg
well of all that pre&s;ents and &s;trikes the Imagination
of a man in travelling into foreign Parts, whether
it concern Religion, Morals or Politicks, there's
need of both elevation and clearne&s;s in the Judg|ment;
<PB N="15" REF="144">
that is to &s;ay, &s;uch a mea&s;ure of both, as
may di&s;po&s;e things in &s;o much order that they don't
perplex and confound the Minds of other Men, nor
produce any thing in 'em but Light. And this
Qualification is not to be acquir'd if a Man is not
born with a &s;utable di&s;po&s;ition. It can't be well ex|plain'd
but by Practice; however, to give &s;ome Idea
of it, it &s;eems to me to con&s;i&s;t in three things:
Fir&s;t, In laying the &s;tre&s;s of one's Judgment on that
which makes the lea&s;t appearance in an Intrigue or
Negotiation; for Policy being the Academy of Di&s;|gui&s;e,
and an exerci&s;e of Craft and Subtilty, gene|rally
that which appears lea&s;t in a politick Ob&s;er|vation
may pa&s;s for the mo&s;t real and true part of
it. Secondly, In never counting any thing &s;uffi|ciently
explain'd to determine one's mind about it,
that &s;o the unexpected &s;ounding of &s;ome Circum|&s;tance
or other, that does not &s;eem to be thought
of, may give one a di&s;covery of &s;omewhat of which
the Mini&s;try of a Court perhaps is not aware. And
&s;o much the more in as much as &s;peculative Policy
being &s;uppos'd impenetrable, and not beginning to
appear till 'tis going to be put in execution, 'tis in
the Circum&s;tances of the Execution that you are
to &s;eek the certain di&s;covery of the De&s;ign. Third|ly,
In the oppo&s;ition of one thing to another; for
altho the means employ'd in any particular politick
De&s;ign may be ab&s;olutely alter'd from one day to
another, becau&s;e there's no Medium always e&s;&s;ential
to and in&s;eparable from Policy, yet 'tis certain, con|&s;idering
how Men are made, that 'tis probable the
Council of a Prince don't alter their common No|tions,
nor take up Re&s;olutions as contradictory one
to another as Black to White: and therefore the
Oppo&s;ition an intelligent Traveller di&s;covers in the
Affairs on which he is making ob&s;ervation, ought to
&s;u&s;pend his Judgment, and to oblige him to for|bear
<PB N="16" REF="145">
determining his Opinion, till time give him
further light. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Rules forms the
Judgment, and renders it &s;olid; the &s;econd culti|vates
and refines it; and the third advances it to
Perfection. The fir&s;t is owing more to Nature than
Experience; the &s;econd depends as much on Expe|rience
as on a Genius: and the third rai&s;es the
Mind to a con&s;ummate Prudence, which is the highe&s;t
pitch of politick Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>That Traveller who has not an elevation of Mind
capable of &s;uch Inventions as may out-wit another,
may make u&s;e of the &s;econd Character of a prudent
Mind, namely, to enquire much into things, and
determine but little about 'em; but if a Man wants
both the one and the other of the&s;e Qualities, we'll
venture to prophe&s;y that he'll never become a Po|litician.</P>
<P>The Memory in the judgment of many pa&s;&s;es for
one of the mo&s;t excellent Faculties of the Soul:
But few con&s;ider, that &s;eeing it brings out nothing
but what has been committed to it before, when
there is Confu&s;ion in the Mind, there mu&s;t al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;arily
be the like di&s;order in the Memory. 'Tis
a great advantage to a Traveller to have a Memo|ry
ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ible, provided it be faithful; for if
a Man becau&s;e he has &s;een much, goes about to utter
a great deal without giving an intelligible account of
matters, by rea&s;on of that Confu&s;ion which the ama|zing
diver&s;ity of Things, Names and Circum&s;tances
ordinarily occa&s;ions, his Memory appears to be a
mere Labyrinth of Perplexity.</P>
<P>I have always look'd upon an ea&s;y Memory to be
like a hand&s;ome Face, which hides a great many
Infirmities in a crazy Body, and &s;trikes the Fancy
more than all the&s;e Imperfections, tho they really
much out-balance it. For be&s;ides that &s;uch a Me|mory
&s;erves for a Rock for the Imagination to &s;plit
<PB N="17" REF="145">
on, and this becomes as dangerous to the Rea&s;on
and Judgment, &s;uppo&s;ing it not to be incompatible
with the regular exerci&s;e of either of the&s;e; yet
'tis mo&s;t certain a great multiplicity of Facts require
either abundance of time to range 'em in good or|der,
or a prodigious heat of Fancy to melt 'em
down (as it were) altogether, without making any
alteration in 'em. So that it &s;eems an impo&s;&s;ible
&s;uppo&s;ition, that an ea&s;y Memory can be &s;trong and
true, &s;o as not to divert from that &s;teady Applica|tion
which the Judgment requires.</P>
<P>And yet both are nece&s;&s;ary for a Traveller, &s;o
that one of the&s;e Qualities without the other would
be of no u&s;e to get the knowledg of the State-Re&s;olutions
of any foreign Politicians: For if what
he learns to day is not &s;upported with all tho&s;e
Circum&s;tances that may render it more than pro|bable
to his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and is not produc'd afre&s;h in
all its Circum&s;tances when any Affair that bears a
proportion to it pre&s;ents, 'tis ea&s;y to conceive that
all the Circum&s;tances that help'd him at fir&s;t to de|cide
the matter in hand being repre&s;ented to him but
by halves, and in the room of tho&s;e that are omit|ted
others &s;ub&s;tituted which alter the &s;tate of the
ca&s;e; 'tis not difficult, I &s;ay, to conceive that &s;uch
an ea&s;y Memory mu&s;t ca&s;t him into confu&s;ion, be|cau&s;e
it does not faithfully revive all tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances.
This Conclu&s;ion may be &s;et in a clearer|light
by an Example.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;ier <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> who be&s;ieg'd <HI>Vienna</HI>
remember'd the Advice, and a great many of the
Projects Count <HI>Tekely</HI> had given him in his Tent at
their enterview beyond <HI>Buda</HI> before this great En|terprize:
And his Memory reproduc'd that in his
extremity, which his Pride had made him de&s;pi&s;e.
The Count per&s;waded him to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the
Bridges of <HI>Vienna</HI> on the North-&s;ide before he made
<PB N="18" REF="146">
a formal Siege, pre&s;uming that by this means he
would either block up the late Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>
with his Troops in <HI>Leopal&s;tat,</HI> or oblige him to quit
it with the more &s;peed, and a greater number of his
Men, which would make the Circumvallation more
ea&s;y, and the Gari&s;on probably le&s;s numerous, or
el&s;e the Duke would expo&s;e him&s;elf to be fir&s;t routed
in the field&punc; and never was any Advice more wi&s;ely
given, or more ra&s;hly contemn'd.</P>
<P>When this Vi&s;ier was mortified by the Re&s;i&s;tance
of the Be&s;ieged, and re&s;olv'd to attempt any thing
to repair the damage he had &s;u&s;tain'd, and the time
he had lo&s;t in this Siege, he was willing to have re|cour&s;e
to Count <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Coun&s;el, and would needs
endeavour to be ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Bridges, without
con&s;idering the difference of Time and other Cir|cum&s;tances;
he gave his Orders for the execution
of this De&s;ign, but in&s;tead of depriving <HI>Vienna</HI> of
good part of its Gari&s;on, or of weakening tho&s;e
Succors which the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> manag'd &s;o
long, and to &s;o good purpo&s;e again&s;t him, as he
might certainly have done in the former Juncture,
he dimini&s;h'd his own Force, and &s;ent his Troops to
be cut in pieces without being able to execute the
Orders they had receiv'd.</P>
<P>By this one may judg that an ea&s;y Memory is al|ways
dangerous when 'tis unfaithful; tho I confe&s;s
'tis le&s;s &s;o in the &s;peculation of a Traveller than in
the conduct of a State&s;man, who ought from the
very fir&s;t &s;tep he takes to di&s;tru&s;t it more than de|pend
on it. Memory is a great help at the Bar, and
in the Pulpit, but 'tis the lea&s;t Qualification of a
State&s;man. 'Tis by reading (which is a kind of
Travelling) and by Travelling (which is a living
&s;ort of reading) that a Man is to be convinc'd of
this Truth, that an ea&s;y Memory being u&s;ually
treacherous when 'tis over-charg'd with many things
<PB N="19" REF="146">
that have no mutual connexion, nothing is to be
omitted that may render it le&s;s ea&s;y and more
faithful.</P>
<P>I think I have ob&s;erv'd by Experience three Rules
that contribute much to reduce the Memory to this
&s;tate, which is certainly no ea&s;y matter to accom|pli&s;h.
The fir&s;t is, for a Man to learn well the chief
foreign things about which he has a mind to employ
his Memory, without troubling him&s;elf to retain the
proper Names of Places, Per&s;ons and Times, of
which Gazetteers &s;eldom fail to give a very particu|lar
account for the information of the Curious, be|cau&s;e
'tis their province to know things of this
kind. The &s;econd is, To join that which one de|&s;ires
to know, to what one knows already by &s;ome
<HI>Epocha</HI> of Facts, Times, or Conjunctures, which re|&s;emble
and refer one to another; as, for in&s;tance,
to join to the rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> the politick
Propo&s;ition made by the King of <HI>Poland</HI> for his
elde&s;t Son to be married to the Archdutche&s;s as his
Reward for relieving that City. The third is, to
unite and accommodate both the one and the other
to the Circum&s;tances and actual Conduct of the
Country where a Man is at pre&s;ent, or whither he
is to return; becau&s;e what pa&s;&s;es there can't ea&s;ily
e&s;cape the Mind, being often reviv'd by the Memo|ry,
and therefore that which has been link'd to it
will al&s;o be retain'd, and the Memory render'd faith|ful
to &s;uch a degree, that all things will be ea&s;ily re|collected.</P>
<P>I &s;ay a Man ought in the fir&s;t place thorowly to
po&s;&s;e&s;s his Mind with the fir&s;t di&s;coveries he makes
in his Travels; that is to &s;ay, after he has made a
deep &s;earch into the Precepts of Policy (without
which nothing is to be expected of him) to look on
every &s;ide upon that which fir&s;t &s;trikes his Mind in a
manner different from the Prejudices he has brought
<PB N="20" REF="147">
out of his own Country, that &s;o he may object a|gain&s;t
his own Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all tho&s;e Rea&s;ons that
he imputes to the Prejudices of others, which is fit
to be demon&s;trated by an Example.</P>
<P>A French Man that goes to <HI>Rome</HI> furni&s;h'd with
many Advantages and Recommendations that give
him acce&s;s to Per&s;ons of Quality, is pre&s;ently loaded
with Civilities, without being taken into that kind
of Familiarity with them, which is &s;o agreeable to
his Humor: This makes him impatient, and it &s;eems
no &s;mall Puni&s;hment to him to continue &s;ix weeks
at <HI>Rome,</HI> to live all the while in an Inn: But at
length the Rea&s;ons of this kind of Treatment are
open'd to him, and he comes to under&s;tand that the
<HI>Italian</HI> loving Splendor tho he is not rich, and af|fecting
to be liberal without incommoding him&s;elf,
waits to regale him after a magnificent manner and
in good company, when he finds a proper time for
it, and then his Splendor, Profu&s;ion and Magnifi|cence
will appear at once. He mu&s;t therefore ex|amine
all the Rea&s;ons of this kind of Conduct; and
by oppo&s;ing this liberty the <HI>Italians</HI> re&s;erve to them|&s;elves,
to the ordinary profu&s;ene&s;s of that Nation,
he'll be convinc'd that they do well at <HI>Rome</HI> not to
live in that familiarity he &s;o much de&s;ir'd. The&s;e
Di&s;coveries will be &s;erviceable to him at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI>
and he'll appear a knowing Man in other places
in proportion to the faithfulne&s;s of his Memory in
reviving the Rea&s;ons, and different re&s;pects that
have determin'd him at <HI>Rome.</HI> This is what I call
a thorow po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of the Mind with that which
one de&s;ires to commit to Memory.</P>
<P>The &s;econd method is, to join things together by
&s;ome <HI>Epocha</HI> that is remarkable, and not ea&s;y to be
chang'd. This Connexion is like a Guide always
going before the Judgment with a light in his hand,
&s;o that he &s;eldom mi&s;takes his way who is conducted
<PB N="21" REF="147">
by it. The <HI>Epocha</HI> contributes much to the fidelity
of the Memory, and the things being allied toge|ther
by a proper reference and proportion, 'tis al|mo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible that the revival of 'em in the Me|mory
&s;hould not be exact and true.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of which is not from the nature of
tho&s;e Incidents which accidentally happen to be
link'd together, but from the immediate applica|tion
of the Mind, which becau&s;e it omits nothing
that may give it a deep impre&s;&s;ion of a thing, can't
&s;ee two different Circum&s;tances which concur to the
&s;ame Fact, without making a certain fix'd Point, as
well for the Time, as other Conjunctures: 'Tis this
that has occa&s;ion'd &s;o many Digre&s;&s;ions in antient
Hi&s;torians, who have not been able to re&s;i&s;t that
natural Inclination of &s;hewing in the &s;ame Treati&s;e,
what they had ob&s;erv'd at the &s;ame time, and by
the &s;ame di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In fine, the third method of rendering the Me|mory
faithful is, to reunite the Notices one receives,
and the Conjunctures that pre&s;ent, to what actually
pa&s;&s;es in one's own Country; becau&s;e the revival
of what is acted there mu&s;t needs be frequent and
of long duration, and a Man's mind will nece&s;&s;arily
be concern'd about it; and &s;eeing this obliges a
Man to join to his pre&s;ent Ob&s;ervations, that which
pa&s;s'd in his own Country when he was there, he
is as it were tied fa&s;t to the Circum&s;tances of things
&s;o that he cannot ea&s;ily mi&s;take 'em, but is nece&s;&s;a|rily
oblig'd to revive 'em in his mind. 'Tis true,
there mu&s;t be &s;trength of Thought, Labor and Time
to reunite the&s;e things after long Voyages, e&s;peci|ally
if our Traveller has not had much corre&s;pon|dence
with his own Country: But Experience every
day &s;hews that 'tis no impo&s;&s;ible thing.</P>
<P>This is, in my opinion, the innocent Art of ren|dering
an ea&s;y Memory faithful; let us now pa&s;s
<PB N="22" REF="148">
to the other Qualifications of a Traveller.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that he ought to have a &s;weet and
in&s;inuating Humor, not by a &s;tudy'd compo&s;ing of
him&s;elf, which will &s;oon betray him when he tarries
long in a place, but by a docility of Mind, which
makes a Man as it were naturally comply with things
that one would think mu&s;t needs &s;hock him, to judg
of him by the gu&s;t of his Country. 'Tis this
&s;weetne&s;s of temper which becomes Affability in
tho&s;e who are in public Po&s;ts, but in Travellers it
&s;hould always be Conde&s;cen&s;ion, without degene|rating
into a &s;ervile weakne&s;s of Mind: And they
ought to have the art of u&s;ing this Conde&s;cen&s;ion
after an advantageous manner, &s;o as to engage tho&s;e
with whom they conver&s;e, either to confide in 'em,
or to inform 'em. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that one
happens to be with an Engli&s;h-man who boa&s;ts of
his own Nation, in re&s;pect of its Strength, Courage,
Trade, Plenty and Independence; and &s;carce ever
&s;peaks of a French-man, an Italian, or a German,
without contempt; a Traveller who has docility,
and yet firmness of Mind, will in &s;incere terms give
his Suffrage to applaud what is good in the Engli&s;h
Nation, and in their Polities, without undertaking
to make compari&s;ons between Nation and Nation,
or &s;o much as between Man and Man, which ought
to be indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided; becau&s;e there are al|ways
in foreign Countries &s;ome Per&s;ons that go un|der
a di&s;gui&s;e, who&s;e Genius, Country, Intere&s;t and
De&s;igns, can &s;carce ever be di&s;cover'd, but yet by
this means may be won upon. In ob&s;erving this
Conduct, our Traveller would not fail to attract the
Confidence of &s;uch an Engli&s;h-man, and &s;o might
get out of him why the Engli&s;h Nation is &s;o fickle
and un&s;teady in the mid&s;t of all its Pro&s;perity, why
they are &s;o eager after Gain amid&s;t &s;o great Riches,
and why they are &s;o unfit for long Enterprizes and
<PB N="23" REF="148">
tedious Conque&s;ts, tho they have &s;uch good Armies
and Fleets. In a word, he'd learn more of this
Engli&s;h-man in three days, than he could perhaps
in reading all the Hi&s;torians that have written of
that Country.</P>
<P>But to give the Demon&s;tration of this, when ever
any thing flatters and plea&s;es a Man to &s;uch a degree
as to make him de&s;pi&s;e what does not &s;eem to bear a
proportion to it, either he is a Fool, or under a di&s;|gui&s;e,
or an intelligent Man &s;et upon his own Inte|re&s;t,
and over-zealous for it. If the fir&s;t, a wi&s;e
Traveller will ea&s;ily di&s;cover him, and contemn
him, without troubling him&s;elf to talk with him.
If the &s;econd, he'll make trial of him by the Rules
I have been laying down; &s;o that this Man under a
Mask &s;hall not be able to proceed far without being
either reduc'd to &s;ilence, or el&s;e betraying him&s;elf.
If the la&s;t, he can't be a man of Knowledg but by
the univer&s;al Principles of Policy, in which he has
no advantage above our Traveller, or el&s;e by &s;uch
particular Deci&s;ions he has made as are proper to
his Country; and in this point he excites all the
Curio&s;ity of our Traveller, who for his own &s;ati&s;|faction
mu&s;t apply him&s;elf to receive In&s;truction
with all that nice Complai&s;ance which we have been
already &s;uppo&s;ing; he mu&s;t hearken, applaud, and
enquire: for Attention and Applau&s;e always pro|cure
the E&s;teem and Confidence of him that &s;peaks;
and a &s;weet, ingenuous and mode&s;t way of inquiring
always returns with &s;ome di&s;coveries; Experience
&s;hews that it never fails to get &s;ome degrees of
knowledg out of tho&s;e upon whom 'tis duly tried.
The Information I have receiv'd even from a Ser|vant
as it were by accident, of a Vi&s;it made by a
certain Per&s;on to his Ma&s;ter, has furni&s;h'd me
with the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of diving into an Affair, of
which I had not the lea&s;t thought, and the di&s;co|very
<PB N="24" REF="149">
very of which gave me that &s;atisfaction which is a|greeable
to one that travels for his Information.</P>
<P>But to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters"> this Effect the more certain; to this
quality one ought to add a Curio&s;ity that is not im|patient.
Curio&s;ity is needful in travelling, but then
it ought not to be too brisk and lively, that one
may the better di&s;&s;emble the Motives of it, and
cover 'em with the u&s;ual pretexts of &s;uch a vain
Curio&s;ity as only applies it &s;elf to the de&s;cription
of Churches, Palaces, Gardens, Fortifications, and
the detail of &s;uch Coun&s;els and Circum&s;tances as
the meane&s;t Servants of a Court always under&s;tand,
as well as tho&s;e that compo&s;e Hi&s;torical Relations.
There mu&s;t be Curio&s;ity to mitigate the unea&s;ine&s;s
and difficulty a man mu&s;t be &s;ure to meet with in
accommodating one's way of Living, Habit and
Manners, to the Cu&s;tom of Countries &s;o unlike one's
own: for &s;eeing Self-love hath more pre&s;&s;ing Rea|&s;ons
when it deprives it &s;elf of what is plea&s;ing to it,
to expo&s;e it &s;elf to that to which it has an aver&s;ion;
'tis nece&s;&s;ary that it be requited for quitting what it
&s;o naturally likes, by &s;ome other &s;atisfaction which
the Fancy has the art to repre&s;ent as greater, more
rare, and more durable; without which there's no
probable ground to expect a Man &s;hould travel with
delight, and 'twould be an unadvi&s;ed thing to at|tempt
it. For to &s;uppo&s;e that all tho&s;e advantages
a Man may make u&s;e of in Travelling will excu&s;e
him from all kind of unea&s;ine&s;s, is to plea&s;e one's
&s;elf with a mere Delu&s;ion, e&s;pecially when a Man
goes out of the Chri&s;tian part of <HI>Europe.</HI> Curio&s;ity
therefore mu&s;t &s;erve in&s;tead of all other Plea&s;ure to
make amends for the Expence and Unea&s;ine&s;s to
which our Traveller is expos'd.</P>
<P>This Curio&s;ity deprives it &s;elf of what it de&s;igns
to obtain, when it once appears to be impatient,
and it really is impatient when ever it appears to
<PB N="25" REF="149">
be &s;o. Men of all Countries in the World are
fram'd after &s;uch a manner, that no Man is willing
to oblige another to his own di&s;advantage; and the
mo&s;t grateful and officious Per&s;on that can be will
never give an occa&s;ion of getting an advantage over
him by what he di&s;covers. All that ob&s;erve a Tra|veller
have in this re&s;pect the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion; eve|ry
body &s;u&s;pects that Man to have &s;ome &s;pecial de|&s;ign,
who leaves his Family and his Country to ex|po&s;e
him&s;elf to Sickne&s;s and other Dangers and In|conveniences,
which are inevitable. They that &s;up|po&s;e
he has only a &s;en&s;ual Curio&s;ity are always in|dulgent
enough to &s;atisfy him in that re&s;pect, be|cau&s;e
&s;elf-love obliges a Man to di&s;cover whatever
is curious in his own Country to a Stranger: but it
being another &s;ort of Traveller that I have been
&s;uppo&s;ing, namely, one who &s;eeks to get an in&s;ight
into State-Policy; the chief Advice I would give
him, is not to deve&s;t him&s;elf of Curio&s;ity (for that
would be unrea&s;onable) but not to be impatient in
&s;eeking to give it &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Impatience is the daughter of De&s;ire, and this
if it be rea&s;onable, mu&s;t be the production of the
Judgment, which will fully convince a Man that
whatever &s;ets him at a greater di&s;tance from the
end he has in view, can't be proper to lead him to
it. Now Impatience will infallibly &s;et our Tra|veller
at a greater di&s;tance from the End he pro|po&s;es,
and con&s;equently cannot be fit to promote
the Plea&s;ure he expects from it. But to make it
the better under&s;tood how and why Impatience re|tards
the &s;atisfaction of the Curio&s;ity, one need on|ly
ob&s;erve that it produces &s;uch precaution in the
Minds of tho&s;e with whom a Traveller conver&s;es,
as becomes a kind of Partition-wall, that he mu&s;t
either pierce through or break down before he can
di&s;cover what is acted on the other &s;ide of it. The
<PB N="26" REF="150">
more importunate a Man of under&s;tanding perceives
a Stranger to be to get information, the le&s;s willing
he is to &s;atisfy him, and keeps the greater guard
on him&s;elf not to gratify his de&s;ire till he is as it
were nece&s;&s;itated to do it, and has learn'd &s;omething
of this Traveller that may oblige him to it. This
Ob&s;tacle is &s;o great that one mu&s;t not think either of
&s;lighting it, or of overcoming it without a con&s;ide|rable
&s;pace of time, and a great deal of manage|ment.
If a Man pre&s;umes to do the former, he'll
find every body prejudic'd again&s;t him, when the
Per&s;on he has &s;lighted comes to explain him&s;elf after
a manner that is di&s;advantageous to him: and if he
depends on the latter cour&s;e, he engages him&s;elf in
a great Charge with more than a moral uncertainty
of &s;ucceeding in his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Would it not therefore be much better for our
Traveller to appear free and ea&s;y in the pre&s;ence of
&s;uch Per&s;ons, that they may not become &s;o cautious,
but may attribute that only to his Curio&s;ity which
by his Impatience he'll give 'em occa&s;ion to impute
to a de&s;ire of knowing the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Go|vernment
in which they are concern'd? And on
this head it will not be improper to alledg an Ex|ample
of which I have been a witne&s;s my &s;elf. I
happen'd to be in a certain foreign Court, where
there was a Dutch-man who had a great deal of
Wit, and made too great an appearance not to be
&s;u&s;pected; this Per&s;on de&s;ir'd Audience of one of
the principal Mini&s;ters of State, who in conver&s;a|tion
making u&s;e of that right which his Rank and
Authority gave him, ask'd him, <HI>What was the Mo|tive
of his Travels?</HI> The Dutch-man thinking to
make his Court to him, an&s;wer'd, that <HI>it was to
learn of him as well as by the Example of other Per&s;ons
of his figure, to under&s;tand the Government of a State.</HI>
The Mini&s;ter coldly replied, <HI>You had need of a great
<PB N="27" REF="150">
deal of time, and a ripene&s;s of Age to &s;ucceed in a bu&s;ine&s;s
of this nature.</HI> To which this Stranger made this
fooli&s;h return, <HI>My Curio&s;ity</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>and impatience
after Knowledg may abridg both the one and the other.</HI>
At this An&s;wer the State&s;man ro&s;e up and left him,
with the&s;e words, <HI>For my part, Sir, I perceive I &s;hall
contribute nothing to either.</HI> And the Dutch-man was
driven to de&s;pair to find him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected by a
Mini&s;ter of State, who had receiv'd him with affa|bility,
and now look'd upon him as a Man of no
&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Needs any more to be &s;aid to &s;hew that Curio&s;ity,
which is &s;uppos'd nece&s;&s;ary to a Traveller, ought
not to be impatient? But for this end there's need
of a great deal of judgment, and a good faculty
of di&s;cerning the Humor of Nations, and the Tem|per
of particular Mens Minds, which is a Talent
that one can't communicate to any Man.</P>
<P>After all it is not impo&s;&s;ible not to be impatient
to learn what one goes &s;o far to &s;eek: for as our
Traveller has not a&s;&s;ign'd his Voyages a preci&s;e
&s;pace of time, much le&s;s does he pretend to pre|&s;cribe
Laws to foreign Nations; 'tis his bu&s;ine&s;s to
accommodate the extent of his Curio&s;ity to the
mea&s;ure of his Capacity, and to proportion the
effects of it to the good &s;ucce&s;s he has had in fo|reign
Di&s;coveries: All Occa&s;ions, Sea&s;ons and Con|junctures
are not equally proper for this purpo&s;e.
There are &s;ome States in which nothing at all
is to be learn'd during the time of War, and
others wherein one can get no information but in
&s;uch a time. In one place Peace is an Ob&s;tacle to
politick Di&s;coveries, in another War &s;huts up all
the Avenues to the confidence of particular Per&s;ons.
There are &s;ome Mini&s;ters under who&s;e Conduct Men
dare not &s;peak, and others under who&s;e Govern|ment
people &s;ay any thing. Hence it is that &s;ome
<PB N="28" REF="151">
Travellers learn more than others, tho perhaps they
are Per&s;ons of like Ability and Curio&s;ity. And if
I may be permitted to add my Opinion, I &s;hall not
&s;cruple to &s;ay, that a Man ought to travel at &s;everal
times and occa&s;ions to the &s;ame Court, to be well
a&s;&s;ur'd of Improvement, and that he has penetrated
into the Maxims and Conduct of it.</P>
<P>Let any one judg after this, whether Impatience is
not an invincible Ob&s;tacle to Curio&s;ity, and how
great a di&s;advantage they mu&s;t be under, who&s;e too
great Vivacity precipitates 'em, and who&s;e warm
Temper expo&s;es 'em rather to the Cen&s;ure than
procures 'em the Confidence of foreign Nations.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;till much wor&s;e when a Man has not &s;uch
a politick undetermin'd po&s;ture of Mind as to act
with impartiality, and not to &s;hew any prejudice or
a &s;trong inclination to the Maxims of his own
Country on the one hand, and on the other hand
an indifference for tho&s;e of others. And this being
the great and indeed the original fault that Men
carry into other Countries, one can't too much ar|gue
again&s;t it, and &s;hew the danger of it.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al Rea&s;on, which is the foundation of
Policy, directs that a Man of Honor part from his
own Country undetermin'd in his Mind, that is, &s;o
di&s;pos'd to learn of all Men according to the fore|mention'd
Pa&s;&s;age of the wi&s;e Man; <HI>Bona enim &amp;
mala ex hominibus tentabit; He &s;hall try what is good
and evil among Men:</HI> That he may appear docile
to every Man, and receive any one courteou&s;ly who
is willing to give him any Information. 'Tis not
only u&s;ele&s;s but dangerous to travel without this
di&s;po&s;ition; for the diver&s;ity of Minds one meets
with being the only remedy again&s;t Prejudice, an
incon&s;iderate and heady Traveller often ruins his
Health, as well as corrupts his Rea&s;on, by every
thing which might otherwi&s;e improve the one and
<PB N="29" REF="151">
re&s;tore the other. 'Twas this that made the late
Elector Palatine &s;ay, <HI>That Man is a fool that goes out
of his own Country without hopes of returning with
more Honor, Wi&s;dom and Knowledg than what he carried
abroad.</HI></P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition being &s;uppos'd will be followed
by another, and that is, that a wi&s;e Traveller will
never return undetermin'd in his Mind, as he was
when he went out: But fully convinc'd what is the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid Advantage, with which he
has had the addre&s;s to form his Mind in proportion
to the Capacity he has had of ca&s;ting abundance
of differing matters together, only to extract out
of 'em what might contribute to his improvement in
Knowledg.</P>
<P>This temper of Mind is more ea&s;ily &s;poken of
than found; for the Mind mu&s;t be moulded after
an extraordinary manner to be capable of that do|cility
which places a Man at the feet of others to
learn their In&s;tructions; and 'tis next to a Miracle
to find a Genius of this Character, which is fix'd
and &s;olid enough to come to a determination in the
mid&s;t of &s;uch a prodigious number of Maxims
which all re&s;ult from Rea&s;on as their Principle, tho
the Effects they produce appear &s;o oppo&s;ite one to
another. And again there is danger le&s;t this do|cility
with which a Man prepares him&s;elf in going
abroad, &s;hould degenerate into Irre&s;olution, Ea&s;ine&s;s,
and &s;ervile Complai&s;ance at his return. That which
is to be &s;een in the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who are
willing to make too deep and prying a &s;earch into
matters of Religion in prejudice to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Sy&s;tems, who often by their too curious Enquiries
are brought at la&s;t to &s;it loo&s;e from all Religion, and
die in this irre&s;olution of Mind, often happens to
tho&s;e middle-witted Per&s;ons who&s;e Minds are tracta|ble
in appearance, but weak in reality, &s;o that by
<PB N="30" REF="152">
the very pro&s;pect of the many different Maxims of
Government, they become uncapable of governing;
becau&s;e their Minds are not endow'd with a vigor
and heat &s;ufficient to melt down all &s;uch matters
together, and to extract out of 'em only what pre|ci&s;ely
&s;utes with the Government of the Country in
which they live.</P>
<P>One may every day &s;ee not only a great many
Travellers, but even Mini&s;ters of State and Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
who&s;e Minds are &s;o fram'd, that their
Heads turn round in&s;tead of becoming firm and &s;ta|ble
at the appearance of &s;o many different Circum|&s;tances
and Mea&s;ures. On which account the old
Prince <HI>Lubomirski</HI> was wont to &s;ay, that <HI>&s;uch &s;ort of
Men are &s;ent abroad to learn the art of being regular
Fools.</HI> Indeed &s;uch Per&s;ons appear &s;o little furni&s;hed
with the general Ideas of Policy, and &s;o deeply
prepo&s;&s;es'd with the particular Maxims of their
own Country, that their Weakne&s;s is di&s;cover'd
almo&s;t as &s;oon as they begin to talk.</P>
<P>To &s;peak yet more plainly for the good of the
publick, 'tis Ignorance that determines the Judg|ments
of &s;ome Travellers; even before the Maxims
of foreign Countries are known to 'em, they go from
home &s;o full of Prejudice, that they are re&s;olv'd to
return po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with greater Opiniatrety than when
they went out: whence it comes to pa&s;s either that
they can learn nothing becau&s;e of their prevention,
or el&s;e they &s;ee and ob&s;erve &s;o much that they can
come to no deci&s;ive Judgment, like tho&s;e who have
more Victuals in their Stomachs than they have natu|ral
heat to dige&s;t. To this purpo&s;e the late Prince
<HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> us'd to &s;ay; <HI>If the&s;e Travellers
would learn with a de&s;ign of improving in Knowledg,
they would act becomingly; but to pre&s;ume they know every
thing, before they are capable of learning, is the way to be|come
a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Fop.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="152">
And Ignorance in this matter contains in it three
re&s;pects, which the greate&s;t part of the World does
not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider, at lea&s;t they &s;eldom or ne|ver
unite 'em all together. The fir&s;t regards the
Principles of univer&s;al Policy; which Per&s;ons of or|dinary
Parts almo&s;t perpetually confound with the
actual Determinations of the Government of their
Country. 'Tis true, there are every where &s;ome
Minds more &s;ublime and judicious, who go to the
bottom of things, and &s;eek out means of repairing
the Defects of the Politicks of their Country: but
it generally &s;o happens that Per&s;ons of this Genius
are &s;eldom advanc'd into favor, and meet with ve|ry
little Re&s;pect in a State; whether it be that they
want Docility to accommodate them&s;elves to the
Humors of others, or Submi&s;&s;ion to procure them
Patrons, or Ambition to pu&s;h 'em forward. It was
of this &s;ort of Men that the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> once
&s;aid, <HI>They were of the &s;ame u&s;e to States, as Props to
old Hou&s;es to hinder their fall.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of Ignorance re&s;pects Per&s;ons of
another Genius, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the former as well
in Number as Authority, are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
privilege of &s;etting a value upon things, and giving
weight to Deci&s;ions that are made: and hence it al|mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily comes to pa&s;s, that that is &s;uppos'd
to be be&s;t and true&s;t, which appears to be mo&s;t au|thoriz'd,
and mo&s;t generally receiv'd. And this
Mi&s;take is almo&s;t irreparable, if we take the mat|ter
in general, in as much as the number of ju&s;t and
&s;ublime Minds being every where very &s;mall, and
that of narrow Capacities almo&s;t immen&s;e in pro|portion
to the other; there is between both a &s;ort
of middle-&s;iz'd Under&s;tandings, to who&s;e Deci&s;ion
tho&s;e of a &s;ubordinate Rank pay a blind deference,
which produces that publick Impre&s;&s;ion which ob|tains

<PB N="32" REF="153">
the fir&s;t places in any Government, are ordinarily
the wi&s;e&s;t and able&s;t Men. This popular Opinion
is often heard without contradiction, and this &s;i|lence
encrea&s;es the number of the Suffrages that are
given 'em, by which means People are confirm'd
and rivetted in their Ignorance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> with &s;ome appearance of Rea&s;on va|lue
them&s;elves upon their &s;crupulous care of avoid|ing
the fir&s;t of the&s;e In&s;tances of National Igno|rance;

hereafter to &s;hew what is their Motive, and how
it is &s;upported, in a Treati&s;e of the Politic Genius
of the United Provinces. But they have too little
firmne&s;s to keep 'em from falling into the &s;econd
Error, which will always mightily check the Projects
they lay in particular Determinations.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> very &s;tupidly fall

liberty of &s;peaking with firmne&s;s of Mind about
public Affairs again&s;t the &s;econd In&s;tance of Natio|nal
Ignorance: and therefore the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein
Ploen</HI> &s;aid one day at <HI>Vienna</HI> with a great deal of &s;oli|dity;
<HI>By the fir&s;t cour&s;e the</HI> Dutch <HI>will &s;upport them&s;elves
a great while, but never advance very far: Whereas the</HI>
Spaniards <HI>have enough to do to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves by
rea&s;on of the actual weakne&s;s of their pre&s;ent Situation;
but if ever they come to recover them&s;elves, they can't
fail of making a very great advance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="153">
The third re&s;pect of this National Ignorance
proceeds from the Indi&s;po&s;ition Men are in to know
others, by rea&s;on of the little &s;incerity and appli|cation
they u&s;e to get the knowledg of them&s;elves,
which betrays 'em into frequent Mi&s;takes, and oc|ca&s;ions
'em to take the Faults of a Nation for the
Genius of it, and the Art of augmenting tho&s;e
Faults (in&s;tead of mending 'em) for Motives of
governing it. Nay more than this, Men are wil|ling
to mi&s;under&s;tand their own Properties which
might be cultivated, and by that means neglect the
Remedies by which they might continually rectify
them.</P>
<P>Perhaps the&s;e Metaphy&s;ical Ab&s;tractions will not
&s;ute every body's Palat; but I have already de|clar'd
that I &s;peak in general without making a
particular application of things, and am unwilling
to offend any one. However 'tis certain that every
Nation has its faults, its &s;ingular qualities, its bright
and dark &s;ides; and if an In&s;tance of this be de|&s;ir'd,
the love of Riches will one time or other
ruin the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but the indefatigable Indu&s;try they
are capable of to acquire Wealth, will be their
&s;upport a long time. Ambition is a fault in the
<HI>French,</HI> which may run to dangerous Extremes; but
their Valor and Activity will &s;erve a great while
to &s;u&s;tain 'em.</P>
<P>To avoid being ignorant of any thing that relates
to this, both the&s;e are to be throughly con&s;ider'd,
and exactly balanc'd one again&s;t the other; and a
Man ought to be convinc'd by him&s;elf which &s;ide
has the greate&s;t weight, either to do the mo&s;t
Mi&s;chief, or procure the mo&s;t Good. But in good
earne&s;t do Men u&s;ually begin their Voyages with
&s;uch a preliminary Knowledg as this? And yet le&s;s
than this will not &s;uffice to travel to any pur|po&s;e;
and for want of this Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, Men carry
<PB N="34" REF="154">
nothing but Ignorance with them into Foreign
Courts.</P>
<P>I could advance a great deal on this Head, but
&s;hall produce only two Examples, which may &s;erve
to in&s;truct others, and 'tis in what I have been a Wit|ne&s;s
my &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>A certain Gentleman that made a good Appea|rance,
and had very great Recommendations (a
fatal help in a Foreign Court when a Man has not
the art of &s;upporting them well by his own Conduct)
was ask'd by a Mini&s;ter of State, What was the oc|ca&s;ion
of his Travels, becau&s;e he &s;eem'd to be of a
weak Con&s;titution, and con&s;iderably advanc'd in
Years, and therefore probably had &s;ome particular
de&s;ign in view. The Gentleman ingenuou&s;ly an|&s;wer'd:</HI>
Sir, I travel to acquaint my &s;elf with <HI>Europe,</HI>
and to take occa&s;ion hereafter to make my own Country
acquainted with it. <HI>The Mini&s;ter replied;</HI> If the
Pencil that is to draw your Picture of <HI>Europe</HI> is like that
with which you de&s;cribe your own Country, there will be
more Fancy than Truth in your Originals. Sir, I can
&s;carce believe <HI>(return'd the Gentleman)</HI> that there are
any more perfect ones than tho&s;e I have left in my own
Country. <HI>Upon which the Mini&s;ter ro&s;e up and &s;aid,</HI>
Sir, you &s;eem to me to be rather &s;truck with one certain
Impre&s;&s;ion than to have a true knowledg of things; you'll
judg of us by that in which you mo&s;t excel: Have a care
that you be not judg'd of here by that in which you are mo&s;t
deficient.</P>
<P>This Stranger was ca&s;t into &s;o great a perplexity,
when he compar'd this An&s;wer with the fir&s;t Com|pliments
of E&s;teem for his Country, and for the Re|commendations
he brought from thence, that he was
quite nonplus'd. And tho he would &s;everal times
fain have recover'd him&s;elf, and endeavor'd by
great Expence, Indu&s;try and Conver&s;ation with in|genious
Men to inform him&s;elf better than he had
<PB N="35" REF="154">
done; all &s;ignified nothing but to give occa&s;ion to
have it &s;aid to him at the end of eighteen Months,
<HI>Sir, you had need to come and con&s;ult us; you &s;ee a
Man learns much if he knows but little when he leaves his
own Country; and that he has made no &s;mall advantage,
who has acquir'd by his Travels the art of Learning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;econd In&s;tance is of one who was &s;ent with
the Charge of a Negotiation to a Court, where he
had Orders to tarry only &s;o long as was nece&s;&s;ary to
perform his Duty, and to wait for an An&s;wer. He
came and lodg'd in a Publick Hou&s;e, where he was
complimented on the part of the Chief Mini&s;ter by
an Abbot, who found him ready to &s;it down at
Table, very much di&s;pleas'd at the way of dre&s;&s;ing
the Victuals which was prepar'd according to the
gu&s;t of the Country: After the fir&s;t Compliments
were pa&s;t, this Envoy could not help &s;aying,</HI> What
&s;ort of a Country have you here, Sir? Here is not &s;o
good eating as in other places where I have been, and
nothing near &s;o good as at my own Table. Sir, <HI>(&s;aid
the Abbot)</HI> Men rea&s;on here as they ought to do, but
do not much trouble their heads about the art of Cookery;
that they leave to other Nations to carry to the highe&s;t
pitch of Perfection they plea&s;e. What <HI>(reply'd the
Envoy)</HI> can there be ju&s;t rea&s;oning in a Country where
every thing &s;eems out of order <HI>At which the Abbot
ro&s;e up and &s;aid,</HI> You &s;hall judg of our Country (if
you plea&s;e) by your &s;elves; and we'll refer our &s;elves
in this matter to your Opinion, provided you don't pre|tend
to &s;ubject ours to your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>By the recital of this fooli&s;h Di&s;cour&s;e of the
Envoy, the Mini&s;ter of State had a &s;ufficient di&s;co|very
of his Character: the day following he came
to his Audience, where nothing was di&s;cours'd but
State-Affairs; and as he was going out, &s;ays the
Mini&s;ter in a tone of Railery: <HI>Be &s;ure to get a good
Dinner, Sir, and pray order your matters &s;o as to dine
<PB N="36" REF="155">
with me to morrow.</HI> The Envoy did not fail to
come, and oppo&s;ite to him was plac'd one of tho&s;e
&s;ecret Cen&s;ors, who penetrate a Man as &s;oon as he
begins to open his Mouth, without regard to his
Office, of which they never &s;peak directly or in|directly.
He was magnificently regal'd, and at
the time when the Table allows a liberty of free
Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>Well Sir,</HI> &s;ays this Cen&s;or, <HI>how d'ye
like this Country? There's nothing but Magnificence</HI>
(&s;ays the Envoy) <HI>every where, but yet here's one thing
wanting:</HI> to which the other wittily reply'd; <HI>If it
be nothing but your Approbation, we can do well enough
without it.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed this Envoy was not long enough at this
Court to improve him&s;elf by it: for when he left
it he was &s;o entirely di&s;pleas'd with it, that by
&s;ignifying his Di&s;gu&s;t, he gave occa&s;ion to 'em to
let him know a thou&s;and ways, that they were
every jot as much di&s;gu&s;ted with him. At his re|turn
he made a ridiculous De&s;cription of this Court:
but Men had need take care what they &s;ay, for
there happen'd to be a Stranger in the company
who made this di&s;dainful Reply: <HI>If your own Coun|try</HI>
(&s;aid he) <HI>could not furni&s;h you with common
Sen&s;e, how could you expect that a Court which you
did but ju&s;t pa&s;s through &s;hould teach you what you had
no di&s;po&s;ition to learn?</HI> This Repartee was carried
to that Court of which this Envoy had given &s;o
un&s;utable a Character, and 'tis certain he a long
time pa&s;s'd there for the greate&s;t Fool that ever was
honour'd with a public Employ: The&s;e are the
Effects of Ignorance, and a &s;otti&s;h Prejudice.</P>
<P>That is never to be learn'd in Travelling which
'tis &s;uppos'd a well-bred Man ought to know be|fore
he engages in Travels. For the Principles
of Society and Policy are &s;o link'd together, that
he that tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the former, renders him&s;elf ri|diculous
<PB N="37" REF="155">
when he &s;peaks, to &s;ignify &s;ome unju&s;t Pre|ference
that he makes in it.</P>
<P>The confounding of a per&s;onal Determination
of a Mini&s;ter of State, together with a National
Determination, is a &s;econd Stumbling-block, again&s;t
which the greate&s;t part of incon&s;iderate and raw
Travellers break their Shins: Who when they are
&s;poken to about the actual Symptoms of the Go|vernment
of their Country, on purpo&s;e to put 'em
upon di&s;cour&s;ing, if in&s;tead of intimating by a wi&s;e
Reply, that they know how to di&s;tingui&s;h the In|tere&s;ts
and De&s;igns of their Country from the
per&s;onal Motives of tho&s;e who govern it, which
on that account determine them otherwi&s;e, they
confound them both together, they pa&s;s for Fools,
and mere Butterflies, that always flutter about that
which ca&s;ts the greate&s;t Light. And after a Man
has once made &s;uch a fal&s;e &s;tep, let him try as
long as he plea&s;es, he'll find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et
him&s;elf right again in the E&s;teem of Men of &s;en&s;e,
Railery will take its turn after &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e;
and the greater Expence he &s;hall be at to intro|duce
him&s;elf into good Company, the more ridi|culous
will he appear to 'em. And if you tell
the&s;e &s;tupid Creatures, or (if you plea&s;e) the&s;e
pretended Politicians, that they err in the fir&s;t
Principles of Policy, they'll treat you as a ridi|culous
and whim&s;ical Per&s;on; nay &s;ome of 'em
have been &s;o ill-temper'd as to endeavour to render
a Man &s;u&s;pected, for having had re&s;pect and kind|ne&s;s
enough for his Country to adverti&s;e 'em of
their Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The Faults of every Nation are known in all
foreign Countries: Nay they compo&s;e divers Axi|oms
of 'em, which are not altogether fal&s;e; for
after all, if they are not all of 'em ab&s;olutely true,
there's &s;omething in 'em infallibly &s;o. And whe|ther
<PB N="38" REF="156">
it be Prejudice or Time that has given Au|thority
to this &s;ort of Proverbs, 'tis certain who|ever
&s;hocks 'em, goes for an extravagant Man.</P>
<P>The Art of Travelling teaches a Man to keep
his equal di&s;tance from the Extremities of wholly
denying, or wholly confe&s;&s;ing &s;uch National Faults.
For 'tis equally dangerous to err on either hand,
which very few Per&s;ons con&s;ider: He that denies a
Fault that is imputed to his Country, pulls an old
Hou&s;e upon his head in irritating the People among
whom he re&s;ides at pre&s;ent, which mu&s;t needs be a
great piece of Imprudence. Nor is that Traveller
much wi&s;er who falls into the other Extreme, that
is, coldly and tamely to grant every Story that is
impos'd on his Country; for tho he &s;hould capti|vate
&s;ome vulgar Minds by this Air of Sincerity,
he'll be &s;ure to get the Reputation of a Fop among
Per&s;ons of Note. 'Tis &s;till wor&s;e when a Traveller
grants that with which his Country is reproach'd,
only to take his turn immediately to twit that
Nation where he is thus attack'd with that Fault
which is imputed to it in our Traveller's Country;
for this is to in&s;ult over People at their own home,
and therefore can't choo&s;e but irritate 'em. And
the wi&s;e&s;t Men will di&s;approve of any man's coming
into a Country to reproach it with a Fault, which
'tis always a&s;ham'd to be thought to have, and
perfectly hates to hear laid to its charge. What
then mu&s;t a Man do in this ca&s;e? Why that which
no body will ever teach you, if you neglect to
learn it before you leave your own Country; And
that is, to &s;tudy well the Defects and Virtues
of your Country by &s;etting 'em in oppo&s;ition one
to the other, that &s;o you may oppo&s;e 'em when
occa&s;ion requires to what is imputed to you, and
may &s;peak of the one, without &s;ignifying any thing
for or again&s;t the others, by entering into a parti|cular
<PB N="39" REF="156">
Examination and Confutation of 'em. By
this Conduct you'l pa&s;s in Foreign Nations for a wi&s;e
Man, by this means your Capacity will be known,
and you'l be con&s;ider'd and e&s;teem'd in proportion
to the Knowledg you appear to have, and to the
Advantage others may have of learning by you
to become acquainted with a Nation which perhaps
they never de&s;ign to &s;ee. And &s;ince one Story
draws out another, that which you give concerning
your Country will infallibly procure you the know|ledg
of the Nation where you are; and by this
Addre&s;s you'll ea&s;ily get a &s;olid under&s;tanding of
what you came to &s;eek, namely, the di&s;covery of
the Genius, Policy, and Manners of a whole Nation.
This is the Product of Skill in the Art of Travelling.
I'll give one In&s;tance which formerly touch'd me
very &s;en&s;ibly. A certain <HI>Italian</HI> being in <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
one of the principal Lords of the Country &s;aid to
him in Conver&s;ation: <HI>Whence is it, Sir, that the</HI>
Italians <HI>never forgive an Injury? My Lord,</HI> reply'd
the <HI>Italian, 'tis becau&s;e they are never ea&s;ily offended.</HI>
Now this being the great fault of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Li|thuanian</HI>
Nobility, the Repartee was very witty, and
as it &s;eem'd to me, the mo&s;t &s;ubtil and ingenious
Cen&s;ure that a Man could pa&s;s on 'em. The <HI>Lithua|nian</HI>
Nobleman receiv'd the Impre&s;&s;ion of it &s;o pru|dently,
that he even affected to expo&s;e the fault
of his Country yet farther, in making this return:
<HI>Sir,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>we &s;hould be as ea&s;ily offended as you
have been made to believe of us in your Country, if
we could be capable of being di&s;pleas'd to hear the Truth
told us with &s;o good a Grace.</HI> He afterwards pre|&s;ented
him with a Hor&s;e, and order'd that he
&s;hould be conducted at his Charge from his E&s;tate,
which lies within two days Journy of <HI>Grodnaw,</HI>
as far as <HI>Dantzick,</HI> whither this <HI>Italian</HI> had a mind
to go.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="157">
And now let any one put in the room of what
he has been reading, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of Mind as
the greate&s;t part travel with, and he'll ea&s;ily per|ceive
what is produc'd by that bu&s;y Preference
which determines on the fir&s;t Prejudices, which
are almo&s;t always fal&s;e, and may ea&s;ily judg by
this whether it was not nece&s;&s;ary to give the Pub|lick
a method of Travelling. I intend hereafter
to treat of the Politic Genius of all the Courts of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and hope the manner in which I &s;hall di&s;|cour&s;e
of 'em will &s;ute the reli&s;h of the World;
becau&s;e I am to treat of the Facts and Maxims of
common U&s;e and Conver&s;ation, without which 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate into the true Spirit of
tho&s;e Courts: And I &s;hall begin with the Port, or
Ottoman Court.</P>
