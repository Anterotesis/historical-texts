<HEAD>A Joyfull Me&s;&s;age &s;ent from the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, to <HI>Robert,</HI> Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> Admirall of his Maie&s;ties Navie Royall.</HEAD>
<P>_THe manifold de|&s;tractions of this Kingdome are great, and the di&s;turbances of this Iland are manife&s;tly and apparently un|der&s;tood, and by &s;ad experience made knowne to the world, in&s;omuch that all Nations doe reioyce, which are Enemies to the Peace of great Brittaine, but I hope all tho&s;e that are Enemies to <HI>Sion</HI> will have their wages paid by the Di|vell
<PB REF="3">that &s;et them at worke, for their mallicious &s;pleene again&s;t this Kingdome hath beene long intended, and now of late tis bur&s;t out in abundance, God grant all tho&s;e that goe about, and &s;eeke the de&s;truction of this Kingdome, and of our gracious Soveraigne King Charles, may be utterly confounded, and brought to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>What a &s;ad and lamentable thing it is, for the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to thinke that a civill Warre &s;hould begin in the Kingdome, who are now at Peace with all the Princes in the World, no inten|tion to take up Armes, but the malig|nant Party &s;eparating his Maie&s;ty from his great Councell, the High Court of Parliament, and creating a mi&s;under&s;tan|ding betweene his Maie&s;ty and them, it is greatly to be feared that the effects will be fatall, for it is a knowne maxime, that Jealuo&s;ie is the Mother of di&s;&s;enti|on, di&s;sention that nouri&s;hes di&s;traction, and di&s;traction inte&s;tine warre, nay a
<PB REF="3">civill Warre, in compari&s;oo of which none is more bloody, and uncivill, and the di&s;tractions of this Kingdome de|clare that we have great cau&s;e to feare that the &s;ame effects will in&s;ue.</P>
<P>For intelligence hath beene given to the Hou&s;e, of great &s;tore of Armes and Ammunition, to be tran&s;ported to <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> for his Maie&s;ties defence, likewi&s;e diuer&s;e pieces of Ordnance, and many other things belonging to warre, like|wi&s;e many Captaines are ready to be tran&s;ported over to &s;erve the King, who have taken an Oath among&s;t them&s;elves that if they be &s;et upon by the way, they will fight it out to the la&s;t man.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e there was a report made to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that there is great preparations made both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> for the rai&s;ing of an Army to be tran&s;ported to his Maje&s;ty, to a&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Parliament, and that the Popes <HI>Nuncio</HI> doth goe about to rai&s;e Forces for the &s;ame de&s;igne.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P> Therfore both Hou&s;es of Parliament, had great doubt that his Maie&s;ty had &s;ome De&s;igne, for the altering his religi|on.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Popes Nuntio hath &s;oli|cited the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> to lend the King of <HI>England</HI> foure thou&s;and men a piece, to helpe to maintaine the Royalty of the King again&s;t the Parlia|ment, but we hope God will direct his Maie&s;ty better.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chiefe grounds of our Feares.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons having taken the afore&s;aid reports into &s;erious con&s;i|deration, gave Order that there &s;hould be a &s;peedy Me&s;&s;age, &s;ent to to the Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> intimating unto him the information which they had received, de|&s;iring him to have a &s;peciall care there|in, and to &s;top the pa&s;&s;ages of all tho&s;e which &s;hall tran&s;port Armes or Ammu|nition, from <HI>Rome, Venice, Parris,</HI> and
<PB REF="4">other neere adioyning parts, as al&s;o from <HI>Holland,</HI> there having beene of late great preparations of In&s;truments of warre, &s;ent over in &s;everall Letters from thence to the high Court of Parliament.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e they received more intelli|gence, of certaine Ships laden with Ord|nance and other Ammunition, to be &s;ent to his Maie&s;ty, and that they are now upon the Sea.</P>
<P>Which Newes doth increa&s;e the for|row of the Parliament, con&s;idering the great mi&s;ery which is like to fall upon the Kingdome, whereby they are infor|ced (for the prevention of which) to ap|ply them&s;elves to the u&s;e of that power which by the Fundamentall Lawes of the Land re&s;ides in them, yet &s;till re&s;ol|ving to keepe them&s;elves within the bounds of faithfullne&s;&s;e and allegiance, to his &s;acred Maie&s;ty.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Honorable Hou&s;es of Parliament thought it convenient, and
<PB REF="5">conduceable to the Peace of the King|dome, for to make further enquiry there|of wherefore they &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, to know of him whi|ther there were any &s;uch thing, or not, the Me&s;&s;enger which carried this Me&s;&s;age returning backe, reported to the Hou&s;e the An&s;wer that he had received from the &s;aid <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, intimating, unto them that he had received no &s;uch intelligence from <HI>Holland,</HI> neither did he know of any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Ordered by the Lords and Commons a&s;esmbled in Parliament, that this Letter be forthwith Printed, and publi&s;hed throughout all the Kingdome.</P>
